<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN proportion as enlightened benevo|lence and true philo&s;ophy gain credit in the world, it becomes the endeavour of tho&s;e who write, to make their pen an in|&s;trument of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to human na|ture.</P>
<P>Many an a&s;piring morali&s;t, embracing the whole circle of rational creation, de|lights him&s;elf with the project of confer|ring an important benefit on mankind in general; and &s;ome, confining their ambition to a narrower province, content them&s;elves with &s;electing, for the objects of their atten|tion, a &s;ingle cla&s;s of mortals, expo&s;ed by their &s;ituation to particular failings, or op|pre&s;&s;ed by peculiar and unmerited afflic|tions. A celebrated philo&s;opher of France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. d'Alembert.</NOTE>
<PB N="xiv" REF="11">
has written a benevolent and admirable e&s;|&s;ay on tho&s;e unfortunate beings called Au|thors; and a contemplative, indefatigable philanthropi&s;t of our own country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The amiable traveller Jonas Hanway, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who&s;e pen has been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed, for half a century, in the &s;ervice humanity.</NOTE> has, with equal goodne&s;s and propriety, produced a treati&s;e on Chimney-&s;weepers. Di&s;&s;imi|lar as the re&s;pective evils of the&s;e different &s;ufferers may be thought, we may find, on examination, a very &s;triking re&s;emblance between them, both in the &s;ervices they perform, and the hard&s;hips they endure. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of an Author, if he under|&s;tands his profe&s;&s;ion, to &s;weep away tho&s;e black and bitter particles, which form a lodgment on the brain, and to give that de|gree of cleanline&s;s and comfort to the peri|cranium of his reader, which the bru&s;h of the Chimney-&s;weeper &s;ecures to the hou&s;e of his employer. The rewards, which are u&s;ually given to the&s;e fellow-labourers in the &s;ervice of mankind, are equally de&s;ti|tute
<PB N="xv" REF="12">
of proportion to the benefit which the world receives from their toil. The fate of both is bitter: but the bitterne&s;s of &s;oot it&s;elf may be con&s;idered as &s;weet, when compared to tho&s;e troubles and mortifica|tions which &s;urround the unfortunate crea|ture, who derives his poor and precarious &s;upport from the labours of his pen. Much credit is therefore undoubtedly due to the humane e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts of France and England, who have endeavoured to alleviate the bur|thens which pre&s;s &s;o heavily on the&s;e two afflicted cla&s;&s;es of mankind: yet I flatter my&s;elf with the idea of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing both the French and Engli&s;h philanthropi&s;t, by di|recting my lucubrations to an order of be|ings, whom I think &s;till more entitled to the regard and protection of an enterpri&s;ing philo&s;opher: I mean the &s;i&s;terhood of Old Maids; a &s;i&s;terhood which has, perhaps, as many unmerited hard&s;hips to &s;upport as the two &s;uffering fraternities above-mentioned, and without the &s;oothing con&s;olation, which tho&s;e fraternities po&s;&s;e&s;s in common, from
<PB N="xvi" REF="13">
the idea, that however ill rewarded they may be, they perform a very u&s;eful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary part in the motley &s;cenes of human life.</P>
<P>I devote my&s;elf, with a new &s;pecies of Quixoti&s;m, to the &s;ervice of Ancient Virgi|nity. It is my intention, in the following work, to redre&s;s all the wrongs of the au|tumnal maiden, and to place her, if po&s;&s;ible, in a &s;tate of honour, content, and comfort.&mdash; I &s;hall begin with a few remarks on the ex|treme cruelty and inju&s;tice of the &s;arca&s;tic contempt &s;o frequently lavi&s;hed on Old Maids in general, and of the tendency which &s;uch treatment has to afflict, exa&s;perate, and deba&s;e the character. I &s;hall proceed to point out the particular failings to which the &s;i|tuation is peculiarly expo&s;ed; and after|wards dwell on the better qualities which it is calculated to promote. I &s;hall then take a general &s;urvey of the various neglect and honour, which appears to have been the lot of Old Maids in different ages of the world; and, examining the pre&s;ent condition
<PB N="xvii" REF="14">
of the &s;i&s;terhood, I &s;hall conclude with to|pics of con&s;olation and advice.</P>
<P>Having thus explained the plan of my E&s;&s;ay, let me profe&s;s to the Ancient Virgins, who&s;e champion I declare my&s;elf, that I &s;hall zealou&s;ly endeavour to afford them both amu&s;ement and in&s;truction.
<Q><L>I hope to &s;teer</L>
<L>From grave to gay, from lively to &s;evere:</L></Q>
and, if my powers prove equal to my wi&s;hes, I flatter my&s;elf that my benevolent production will grow &s;uch a favourite with them, as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, in due time, by the more flattering appellation of The Old Maiden's Manual.</P>
<P>As the efficacy of advice is generally pro|portioned to the e&s;teem entertained for its author, let me be &s;uffered, without an im|putation of vanity, to touch on my own di&s;intere&s;ted conduct in writing this E&s;&s;ay. Were I to employ the &s;ame time and trou|ble in behalf of other &s;uffering &s;ocieties, namely, that of our di&s;graced commanders
<PB N="xviii" REF="15">
or di&s;carded &s;tate&s;men, I might (paradoxical as the a&s;&s;ertion may appear) I certainly might acquire either place or pen&s;ion by &s;uch labour; &s;ince it &s;eems to be a maxim of &s;tate to replace &s;uch public &s;ervants as are peculiarly loaded with public dete&s;ta|tion, and the deeper a di&s;banded politician may &s;ink in infamy, the higher he will be found to ri&s;e in his chances of regaining power. But, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I can have no &s;uch pro&s;pect to &s;timulate my pen; for, though the per&s;ons for whom I write can|not be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s the favour of the pub|lic, yet I &s;olemnly prote&s;t, I have no expec|tation that any one of them will be admitted into the cabinet of any potentate or prime mini&s;ter in all the kingdoms of Europe, or obtain any influence in the United States of America.</P>
<P>A word on my title-page, and I &s;hall clo&s;e my Introduction.&mdash;I was at fir&s;t afraid, that the name of <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on Old Maids</HI> might entrap &s;ome indelicate reader, by its &s;imilarity to the title of a work, which
<PB N="xix" REF="16">
threw our whole nation into a ferment, when a private indecorum was made an in|&s;trument of public iniquity. But I have &s;ince reflected, that if any &s;uch reader is &s;o deceived, <HI>he</HI> (for readers of that cla&s;s mu&s;t be undoubtedly ma&s;culine) he will be very properly puni&s;hed for the viciou&s;ne&s;s of his expectation, by the lo&s;s of the little money which the&s;e pages will co&s;t. Di&s;appointed he will certainly be, as it is the &s;ole purpo&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay to promote the circulation of good-will and good-humour in bodies where they are frequently &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tag|nate; and to effect this &s;alutary and laudable de&s;ign, &s;ometimes with a very &s;erious, and &s;ometimes with a &s;miling countenance, but never by over&s;tepping the line of mode&s;ty and good manners.</P>

<HEAD>PART I. ON THE PARTICULAR FAILINGS OF OLD MAIDS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. On the Situation and Treatment of Old Maids in general.</HEAD>
<P>I WISHED to imitate the example of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who begin a new and elaborate work by the definition of &s;ome im|portant term, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the petty cavils which &s;o frequently ari&s;e from ambiguity and mi&s;under&s;tanding.&mdash;I was apprehen&s;ive of being expo&s;ed to &s;uch cavils,
<PB N="2" REF="18">
if I did not clearly a&s;certain the period when that &s;tate commences, which I have cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of a moral e&s;&s;ay; and from this apprehen&s;ion, I was on the point of de|fining an Old Maid to be, an unmarried wo|man, who has compleated her fortieth year. Though idle witlings might have carped at my definition, as too loo&s;e to be &s;trictly phi|lo&s;ophical, I am convinced that every &s;ober reader would have found it &s;ufficiently pre|ci&s;e for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But, alas, I am afraid that every benevo|lent per&s;on, who begins a work to befriend any part of his &s;pecies, mu&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ed, as he advances, with unexpected difficulties. At the very out&s;et of my pre&s;ent labour, I have been harra&s;&s;ed by &s;o unfore&s;een and &s;o di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing a perplexity, that I think it expe|dient, for my own credit, to give a candid account of it to my readers. This per|plexity aro&s;e from my de&s;ire to fix, in the mo&s;t unexceptionable manner, the aera of <HI>Old-Maidi&s;m</HI>; a phra&s;e which I u&s;e, indeed, without authority: but, as I write on a new
<PB N="3" REF="19">
branch of philo&s;ophy, let me vindicate the philo&s;ophical privilege of coining &s;uch new words as my original work may require.&mdash;I proceed to the account of my di&s;tre&s;s. In conver&s;ing with people of all ages, particu|larly of the female &s;ex, I perceived they had very un&s;ettled and di&s;cordant notions of the aera, which I hoped they would ena|ble me to a&s;certain. The mi&s;&s;es of twenty con&s;idered all their unmarried friends, who had pa&s;&s;ed their thirtieth year, as ab&s;olute Old Maids; tho&s;e of thirty &s;uppo&s;ed the aera to commence at about <HI>forty-five</HI>; and &s;ome ladies of fifty convinced me how dif|ferently they thought upon the &s;ubject, by calling others, about three or four years younger than them&s;elves, by the infantine appellation of <HI>girls</HI>; from whence I pre|&s;umed they would advance the aera I &s;peak of to the age of &s;ixty at lea&s;t. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to collect, from the different voices in the female world, one harmonious and &s;ati&s;factory opinion, I had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t profound philo&s;ophers of my ac|quaintance;
<PB N="4" REF="20">
but, alas, my embarra&s;&s;ment encrea&s;ed in proportion to the number of the per&s;ons I con&s;ulted. One of the&s;e learned gentlemen, who, unfortunately for his own happine&s;s, has as much &s;ceptici&s;m as erudition, attempted to cru&s;h my whole philo&s;ophical work, by a&s;&s;erting, that Old Maids are ab&s;olute <HI>non-entities</HI>; and he in|&s;ultingly defied me to produce a &s;cientific demon&s;tration of their exi&s;tence. I &s;oon left this licentious &s;ceptic to the full enjoy|ment of his own &s;arca&s;tical humour, and con&s;ulted an eminent phy&s;ician of an oppo|&s;ite character, who had lately married an amiable lady of forty-three, and was ju&s;t become, in con&s;equence of that union, the happy father of a very promi&s;ing boy. This more candid doctor pleaded with great energy again&s;t my giving the name of Old Maid to &s;ingle ladies of forty; he a&s;|&s;erted that every female ought to be re|garded as in a juvenile &s;tate, while &s;he has the power of conferring on a hu&s;band &s;o lively a ble&s;&s;ing as that which he had ju&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="21">
had the happine&s;s of receiving. I felt all the weight of the living argument which this forcible rea&s;oner produced again&s;t me. In this embarra&s;&s;ment, I re&s;olved to &s;acrifice my philo&s;ophical accuracy to my politene&s;s; and, in&s;tead of &s;etting out with a po&s;itive definition, I &s;hall decline the dangerous ta&s;k of drawing the preci&s;e line where the epocha of <HI>Old-Maidi&s;m</HI> commences: but having ob&s;erved that the world in general, who are far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the energetic good-na|ture of my friend the doctor, never fail to give the unwelcome title of Old Maid to unmarried ladies of forty, I determined to comply, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with this com|mon and vulgar prejudice, in a dilemma where neither female wit nor ma&s;culine knowledge could afford me a &s;ati&s;factory direction.</P>
<P>And let me ob&s;erve, that by my conduct in this delicate point, I generou&s;ly con&s;ult the intere&s;t of the good maidens, for whom I write, at the painful hazard of their di&s;|plea&s;ure; for if they &s;hould affirm, what I
<PB N="6" REF="22">
am by no means unwilling to allow, that a &s;ingle lady of forty cannot with &s;trict pro|priety be called an Old Maid, yet &s;urely there is great chance of her being &s;o in due cour&s;e of time; if &s;he is not a <HI>profe&s;t mem|ber</HI> of the &s;i&s;terhood, &s;he may certainly be regarded as a noviciate, and as &s;uch &s;he is undoubtedly concerned in all the &s;alutary admonitions addre&s;&s;ed to that in&s;ulted yet re&s;pectable order.</P>
<P>At the age, then, when ladies allow them|&s;elves to be forty, I de&s;ire my fair and &s;ingle friends to con&s;ider them&s;elves as &s;tanding, if not within the gates, at lea&s;t upon the thre&s;hold of that community of which I treat. I reque&s;t them to recollect what qualities and conduct will mo&s;t become the character they are preparing to &s;upport; what will mo&s;t effectually protect it from ridicule and reproach, alleviate its vexations, and en|crea&s;e its comforts. The&s;e are &s;urely points, which it is their intere&s;t to &s;tudy: it is my ambition to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the attainment of this u&s;eful knowledge; and, if I am not de|ceived
<PB N="7" REF="23">
by that &s;pecies of benevolent illu|&s;ion, to which a philo&s;opher is peculiarly &s;ubject, they may render them&s;elves both wi&s;er and happier by the frequent peru&s;al of the&s;e little volumes.</P>
<P>Let us take a &s;urvey of the circum&s;tances which u&s;ually attend the Old Maid, at the time of her fir&s;t acquiring that title. If &s;he has received a polite education&mdash;and to &s;uch I addre&s;s my&s;elf&mdash;it is probable, that after having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;prightly years of youth in the comfortable man&s;ion of an opulent father, &s;he is reduced to the &s;helter of &s;ome contracted lodging in a country town, attended by a &s;ingle female &s;ervant, and with difficulty living on the intere&s;t of two or three thou&s;and pounds, reluctantly, and perhaps irregularly, paid to her by an avaricious or extravagant brother, who con&s;iders &s;uch payment as a heavy incum|brance on his paternal e&s;tate.

The Old Maid, indeed, may often be con|&s;idered, not only as a &s;olitary fly, but as a fly in tho&s;e cloudy and chilling days of au|tumn, when the departure of the &s;un has put an end to all its lively flutter, and leaves it only the power of creeping heavily along in a &s;tate of feeblene&s;s and dejection. If her heart has been peculiarly formed by nature to reli&s;h and to adorn the mo&s;t endearing and delightful of all human connections, &s;he will the more feel the cruelty of that chance which has debarred her from it; and, hard as &s;uch a de&s;tiny mu&s;t appear, her mi&s;ery will frequently ri&s;e in proportion to

tho&s;e merits which entitled her to happine&s;s. A frame of glowing &s;en&s;ibility requires a proper field for the exerci&s;e and expan&s;ion of all its generous affections; and when this is denied to it, &s;uch ob&s;truction will &s;ometimes occa&s;ion the very wor&s;t of evils, a &s;ort of &s;tagnation both in heart and &s;oul, a di&s;order for which language can afford no name, and which, being a compound of mental and bodily di&s;temper, is more dread|ful to &s;upport, and perhaps more difficult to cure, than any di&s;tinct maladies either of mind or body. To &s;en&s;ations of this kind I attribute that very extraordinary fact, recorded in the Moral E&s;&s;ays of Plu|tarch, and mentioned al&s;o by his two amia|ble modern rivals in morality, Montaigne and Addi&s;on, I mean the &s;elf-murder of the Mile&s;ian virgins.

true, indeed, that the records of modern hi&s;tory hardly contain &s;o authentic and de|plorable an in&s;tance of de&s;pairing virginity; and, perhaps, &s;ome acrimonious Old Maids may cen&s;ure, with great bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, the inference which I have fairly drawn from the narrative of Plutarch. It is the mi&s;|fortune of the&s;e exa&s;perated ladies to mi&s;|take their friends for their foes, and to con|&s;ider an expre&s;&s;ion of pity towards any &s;uf|ferers of their &s;i&s;terhood, as a per&s;onal in|&s;ult to them&s;elves&mdash;for their part, they are proud of declaring, they regard the con|dition of an Old Maid as the mo&s;t com|fortable in human life; it is the condition of their choice, and what every wi&s;e woman would chu&s;e. I always look upon &s;uch de|clarations as a kind of ill-con&s;tructed ram|part, rai&s;ed very ha&s;tily by mi&s;taken pride, to defend an unea&s;y &s;ituation: I would ad|vi&s;e all my fair friends, of gentler &s;pirit, to abandon this untenable outwork, and pro|tect them&s;elves by a much nobler mode of defence. The Old Maid who affirms, &s;he

never wi&s;hed to marry, pronounces the &s;e|vere&s;t of &s;atires again&s;t her own heart. How utterly devoid of tenderne&s;s, and of every amiable &s;en&s;ation, mu&s;t that female be, who never felt, at any period of life, a de&s;ire to engage in the duties, or to &s;hare the de|lights, of that &s;tate, to which all human be|ings are invited by the voice of nature and rea&s;on! Indeed, the total exemption from &s;uch innocent, or rather laudable de&s;ire, is hardly within the line of po&s;&s;ibility; and the ancient virgin, who affects this language, will generally be thought to wear a very ungraceful ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y. I would therefore wi&s;h her, whenever &s;he has occa|&s;ion to &s;peak of the nuptial &s;tate, to pre&s;erve that <HI>my&s;terious reverence</HI> with which it is ju&s;tly treated by the &s;ublime&s;t of poets; and to repre&s;ent her own exclu&s;ion from it, not as the effect of choice, ari&s;ing from a cold and irrational aver&s;ion to the &s;tate in gene|ral, but as the con&s;equence of &s;uch perver&s;e incidents as frequently perplex all the paths of human life, and lead even the worthie&s;t

ill-nature; but to &s;neer at the ancient vir|gin, merely becau&s;e &s;he has a claim to that title, is not only incon&s;i&s;tent with good-na|ture and good manners, but, in truth, a piece of cruelty as wanton and malicious as it is to laugh at the per&s;onal blemi&s;hes of any unfortunate being, who has been maimed by accident, or deformed from his birth.

Perhaps the particular failings, which are commonly imputed to the Old Maid in ge|neral, may be found to ari&s;e from the pe|culiarity of her &s;ituation, and the injurious treatment &s;he receives from the world; a con&s;ideration, which, placing the character in a fairer point of view, will, I hope, be the occa&s;ion of its being treated more ten|derly.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. On the Curio&s;ity of Old Maids.</HEAD>
<P>THE human mind is naturally active, and when its faculties are not called into rational exerci&s;e, by the intere&s;ting cares, or the elegant amu&s;ements, of dome&s;|tic life, it is apt to perplex it&s;elf in the mo&s;t idle pur&s;uits and frivolous enquiries. The lady, who has little or no bu&s;ine&s;s to regulate, if &s;he has unluckily failed to cul|tivate a pa&s;&s;ion for the plea&s;ing occupa|tions of needle-work, drawing, mu&s;ic, or literature, is often reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending her thoughts abroad, and at la&s;t is rendered, by habit, a kind of perpetual &s;py on the conduct of her neighbours. Hence the curio&s;ity of an Old Maid is be|come proverbial: and, as I con&s;ider it as one of the foibles which contribute mo&s;t largely to the aba&s;ement of the character, I &s;hall treat it with the &s;everity it de&s;erves.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="36">The curious Old Maid is a re&s;tle&s;s being, who&s;e in&s;atiate thir&s;t for information is an ince&s;&s;ant plague both to her&s;elf and her ac|quaintance; her &s;oul &s;eems to be conti|nually flying, in a giddy circuit, to her eyes, ears, and tongue; &s;he appears inflamed with a &s;ort of frantic de&s;ire to &s;ee all that can be &s;een, to hear all that can be heard, and to a&s;k more que&s;tions than any lips can utter. This raging &s;olicitude for intelligence may be con&s;idered as a kind of mental fever; and, like other fevers, it is frequently brought on by petty habits of unregarded intemperance, by forming, in early life, no government over the tongue, but allowing it the fulle&s;t indulgence in every inqui&s;itive and impertinent caprice. The guardians of female youth cannot caution their pupils too &s;trongly again&s;t the dangerous cu&s;tom of a&s;king idle and in&s;ignificant que&s;tions; for a frivolous curio&s;ity, though it amount not to vice, is, perhaps, the mo&s;t offen&s;ive of all foibles; and, when it has rooted it&s;elf in the mind of an Old Maid, the mo&s;t diffi|cult
<PB N="21" REF="37">
to eradicate or &s;ubdue. Such curio&s;ity is a kind of ravenous mon&s;ter, which hangs upon its prey,
<Q><L>As if encrea&s;e of appetite did grow</L>
<L>By what it fed on.</L></Q></P>
<P>If any thing can tame this wild &s;pirit of impertinent enquiry, in the curious Old Maid, it may be the knowledge of a truth, which I &s;hall therefore mo&s;t freely commu|nicate to her, and which, I dare &s;ay, her own experience will confirm; it is this&mdash; of all the qualities which can deba&s;e or counteract the natural attractions of wo|man, the foible, of which I am now &s;peak|ing, is what our &s;ex is mo&s;t apt to fear and avoid. I have known a very amiable man, who had really no vices to conceal, take as much pains to &s;hun an inqui&s;itive Old Maid, as if he had been trying to e&s;|cape the bite of a rattle-&s;nake; and I have ob&s;erved, that the character acts upon the generality of men as an object of antipathy. There are, however, a &s;et of frolick&s;ome
<PB N="22" REF="38">
and daring blades, who are able to make this teazing impertinence of the ancient virgin a perpetual &s;ource of diver&s;ion. They &s;port with the curio&s;ity of an Old Maid with that kind of fearle&s;s levity, by which a lively &s;chool-boy is &s;ometimes tempted to play with an adder. I knew a &s;prightly gentleman of this humour, who, living in a country town, and having been long pe&s;tered by his oppo&s;ite neighbours, two maidenly gentlewomen of the mo&s;t in|qui&s;itive &s;pirit, contrived to render this provoking nui&s;ance an eternal fund of en|tertainment. At fir&s;t, indeed, they teazed him &s;o much, by their con&s;tant practice of peeping and prying into every minute arti|cle of his dome&s;tic concerns, that, although he was naturally mild and benevolent, his temper was materially injured, and he could hardly mention his neighbours without ut|tering a vehement execration again&s;t their impertinence. But at length he began to &s;peculate on the nature and the force of that inordinate pa&s;&s;ion, which could impel
<PB N="23" REF="39">
two rational creatures, in the decline of life, to exert &s;uch indefatigable activity for the mo&s;t trivial purpo&s;es. He diverted him&s;elf in framing a thou&s;and little devices to try the full extent of this frivolous curio&s;ity; and the avidity of their de&s;ire to know every thing which pa&s;&s;ed in his hou&s;e, and the hi&s;tory of every individual who entered it, furni&s;hed him with the opportunity of putting their curio&s;ity to innumerable trials. A particular account of the&s;e devices, and their &s;ucce&s;s, would form too large an epi|&s;ode for this little work; I &s;hall mention, therefore, only one of his manoeuvres, which afforded him his mo&s;t capital &s;port, and which he di&s;tingui&s;hed by the whim&s;i|cal phra&s;e of <Q><HI>Angling for Old Maids at Midnight.</HI></Q> As this, I believe, is a &s;pe|cies of fi&s;hing not mentioned in the Com|plete Angler, or in any of our elaborate treati&s;es on that amu&s;ing art, it will require a full explanation. Such then was the pro|ce&s;s of my friend in his new-invented di|ver&s;ion: &mdash;Soon after the clock had &s;truck
<PB N="24" REF="40">
twelve, he muffled up his per&s;on in &s;ome dark di&s;gui&s;e, and, &s;allying from a po&s;tern|gate, which opened into a different &s;treet, he proceeded to the front door of his own hou&s;e, and knocked with a very audible rap. His oppo&s;ite old inqui&s;itors were in|duced by their infirmities to go early to bed; but, as curio&s;ity &s;eldom &s;leeps very &s;ound, the hope of a nocturnal di&s;covery never failed to bring either one or both to their window. If they were tolerably well, they ventured to throw up the &s;a&s;h, and to thru&s;t their two &s;harp vi&s;ages as far into the &s;treet as they could with &s;afety be &s;tretched; for they were both too keen to tru&s;t the rela|tion of each other, and panted with equal eagerne&s;s for ocular acquaintance with the object which excited their curio&s;ity. This, however, they could never perfectly attain; their frolick&s;ome neighbour, though a large lamp was burning before his door, con|trived to &s;hew little or nothing of his fi|gure, and yet loitered &s;o long in the &s;treet, as to inflame the old ladies with the mo&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="41">
ardent expectation of farther di&s;covery. He repeated this frolic with diver&s;e petty vari|ations, for the entertainment of different gue&s;ts, and every repetition of it afforded him new diver&s;ion. The more frequently the Old Maids caught a glimp&s;e of the muffled figure, the more eager were they to find out both the name of the per&s;on and the nature of his bu&s;ine&s;s. Voltaire's man in the iron ma&s;k never excited more re&s;tle&s;s wonder, or more extravagant &s;urmi&s;es: &s;ometimes the curious virgins conjectured this nocturnal vi&s;itant to be the lover of a hand&s;ome chamber-maid, and &s;ometimes their &s;u&s;picions fell very heavy on the fair lady of the hou&s;e, who was, indeed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every attraction to excite <Q>Envy in woman, or de&s;ire in man;</Q> but her wit and beauty were equalled, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, by her innocence and good-nature. She frequently remon&s;trated again&s;t this cruel diver&s;ion of her hu&s;band, and pro|te&s;ted he would be the death of the old la|dies,
<PB N="26" REF="42">
by bringing them, half naked, into the damp air of the night. He maintained, on the contrary, that the curio&s;ity of an Old Maid is &s;o fiery a pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he, who is thoroughly inflamed by it, may expo&s;e her &s;hrivelled body, without danger of cold, to the mo&s;t unwhole&s;ome of nightly vapours. The event proved his mi&s;take; for, per&s;e|vering in his &s;port, and trying it as a Chri&s;tmas gambol, at a time when it &s;nowed very much, the mo&s;t elderly and infirm of the two ancient maidens, tempted, perhaps, by that hope of di&s;covery which the addi|tional light of the &s;now might afford her, continued &s;o long at her window, that &s;he contracted a rheumatic fever, which con|fined her for many months to her bed. Yet her &s;ufferings, &s;evere as they were, did not annihilate the curio&s;ity which produced them, if I may credit the te&s;timony of my friend. He po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, that he once de&s;cried this identical old maiden, before &s;he had recovered the perfect u&s;e of her limbs, peeping through her &s;a&s;h at mid|night,
<PB N="27" REF="43">
though &s;he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting her&s;elf, for that purpo&s;e, on the arm of her &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;How u&s;eful and how amiable a being might this unfortu|nate woman have proved, had the activity of her mind been directed to any laudable pur&s;uit! But, I fear, this frivolous curio&s;ity, when it is &s;uffered to take full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirit, may be reckoned among the mo&s;t incurable of mental maladies; and I therefore conjure the &s;i&s;terhood, for whom I write, to guard again&s;t the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the di&s;temper by every po&s;&s;ible precau|tion. Perhaps the mo&s;t early and alarming &s;ymptom of it is the habit, already men|tioned, of a&s;king que&s;tions, in which they have little or no concern. I would wi&s;h them to reflect, that the mo&s;t ordinary and natural que&s;tion may become impertinent and ridiculous, by the avidity with which it is a&s;ked, or by the peculiar &s;ituation of the enquirer; a remark which was &s;ugge&s;ted to me by the following ludicrous occurrence: &mdash;Calling, the other day, on an old ac|quaintance
<PB N="28" REF="44">
in the Temple, I found him ju&s;t returned from the country, where he had pa&s;&s;ed a few weeks with a &s;i&s;ter newly married: as I rapped at his chambers, he was preparing to &s;ally forth on a vi&s;it to a family of five elderly maidens, to whom he had promi&s;ed an early account of his rural expedition. As we have a &s;imilar regard for the&s;e good ladies, I readily attended my friend to their hou&s;e. They are a &s;et of amiable beings, who live together in the mo&s;t &s;i&s;terly concord. Nature, indeed, has not exerted her mo&s;t delicate &s;kill in the formation of their per&s;ons; but their want of beauty is very amply compen&s;ated&mdash; their under&s;tandings, though not brilliant, are cultivated; their hearts benevolent; and their fortune ea&s;y. Though all the five may be fairly counted in the cla&s;s of Old Maids, they are wonderfully free from all the failings imputed to that community, except, indeed, the particular foible which is the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent chapter; and even their curio&s;ity is of the mo&s;t pardon|able
<PB N="29" REF="45">
kind; it is &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, and &s;ometimes ridiculous, but never malig|nant. It is now time to enter on the hi&s;|tory of our vi&s;it. When we arrived at their nice yet comfortable man&s;ion, we found the lady abbe&s;s of this little convent, or, in plain Engli&s;h, the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter of the family, alone in the parlour. In her civilities to my friend, &s;he failed not to enquire after his new-married &s;i&s;ter, and a&s;ked, with great appearance of &s;olicitude, if the lady was breeding. The marriage had not been con&s;ummated more than three months, and my friend very gravely replied, that he re|ally did not know; but he rather believed not. The &s;econd virgin of the hou&s;e now appeared, and in a few minutes made the &s;ame enquiry; to which the barri&s;ter very mildly returned the &s;ame kind of negative. The three younger maidens of the family &s;oon entered the room together; the elde&s;t of the three advanced towards my friend, to conver&s;e with him concerning the mar|ried folks he had vi&s;ited, and, before many
<PB N="30" REF="46">
moments elap&s;ed, &s;he contrived to intro|duce the que&s;tion, which he had twice an|&s;wered already, concerning the pregnancy of his relation. The man of law pre&s;erved, however, the gravity of his countenance, and replied with the &s;ame good-humour, and almo&s;t in the &s;ame words, as he had done before; but unluckily, in the bu&s;tle of arranging our &s;eats, the two younge&s;t virgins of the hou&s;e did not perfectly hear this important reply. Being very eager for full information on the point, and thinking it, perhaps, more delicate to enquire of the lady who heard him, than to trouble the gentleman to repeat his an&s;wer, they both whi&s;pered in the &s;ame moment, but in the oppo&s;ite ears of their &s;i&s;ter, <Q>Is &s;he with child?</Q> Their words were, in|deed, intended for no ear but her's; yet the keenne&s;s of their curio&s;ity made their whi&s;pers audible. The que&s;tion, <Q>Is &s;he with child?</Q> thus repeated by two voices at the &s;ame time, appeared like the different parts of a catch, and, combined
<PB N="31" REF="47">
with the eagerne&s;s of manner in the &s;ingular figures who uttered them, produced a truly comic effect. A bur&s;t of in&s;uppre&s;&s;ible laughter rendered me unable to &s;peak; but my friend, the barri&s;ter, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing greater powers of countenance, immediately ex|claimed, My dear ladies, as ye take &s;uch a generous intere&s;t in the increa&s;e of the world, I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h that ye may all participate in that noble and nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;i|ne&s;s! The three elder virgins looked ra|ther grave upon this ha&s;ty &s;peech of my friend, con&s;idering it, perhaps, as a kind of &s;arca&s;tical reproof on the eagerne&s;s of their curio&s;ity, or lamenting, po&s;&s;ibly, the too evident futility of &s;uch a wi&s;h; but in the eyes of the two younge&s;t ladies, who &s;eem to con&s;ider them&s;elves as noviciates only in the order of Old Maids, I ob&s;erved &s;uch a fla&s;h of &s;udden and doubtful joy, as is apt to illuminate the countenance of a per&s;on &s;urpri&s;ed by a very flattering, though not a very probable prediction.</P>
<P>Trifling as it may appear, I am induced
<PB N="32" REF="48">
to in&s;ert the preceding incident in this e&s;&s;ay, by having remarked, on many different oc|ca&s;ions, that of all the que&s;tions in familiar life, which the curious Old Maiden is tempted to a&s;k, there is none which &s;he utters with more frequency, or more eager|ne&s;s, than que&s;tions concerning the preg|nancy of her mo&s;t common acquaintance. As I apprehend that the &s;i&s;terhood, in walk|ing upon &s;uch tender ground, may be often galled and pelted by the &s;curvy je&s;ts of many mercile&s;s wags, I wi&s;h the amiable, though inqui&s;itive Old Maid, to be cau|tioned by the foregoing anecdote, and to &s;ecure her&s;elf from &s;uch raillery, by applying for information of this &s;ort to per&s;ons of her own &s;ex, and in the hours of female re|tirement; a&s;&s;uring her, however, that it is only my intention to direct her in the mode of enquiry, and not to &s;uppre&s;s her very innocent de&s;ire of being made acquainted with the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of the world.</P>
<P>The gratification of curio&s;ity, even in matters of little moment, is undoubtedly

plea&s;ant; and, as I am very far from de&s;ir|ing to abridge the &s;canty plea&s;ures of the Old Maid, I would wi&s;h her curio&s;ity to be indulged in all points, where it has no ten|dency to di&s;turb the tranquillity of others, or to bring the galling burthen of con|tempt and ridicule upon her&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. On the Credulity of Old Maids.</HEAD>
<P>IN the days of Addi&s;on, the credulity of &s;uper&s;tition was reckoned among the mo&s;t &s;triking characteri&s;tics of the ancient virgin, as we learn from the excellent paper of that engaging morali&s;t, on the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and depre&s;&s;ive of human follies.</P>
<P>"An Old Maid" (&s;ays the Spectator), <Q>that is troubled with the vapours, pro|duces infinite di&s;turbances of this kind among her friends and neighbours. I know a maiden aunt, of a great family, who is one of the&s;e antiquated &s;ibyls, that forebodes and prophe&s;ies from one end of the year to the other. She is always &s;eeing apparitions, and hearing death-watches; and was the other day almo&s;t frighted out of her wits by the great hou&s;e-dog that howled in the &s;table,
<PB N="35" REF="51">
at a time when &s;he lay ill of the tooth|ach.</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, however, to the credit of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, and to the honour of their mo&s;t amiable and &s;ucce&s;sful advo|cate, the great author whom I have quoted, that the &s;uper&s;titious follies of our country are almo&s;t eradicated. Such an antiquated &s;ibyl as Addi&s;on painted, po&s;&s;ibly from the life, is now, I think, very rarely to be found among us. In reckoning credulity among the peculiar foibles of the Old Maid, I mean a credulity diametrically oppo&s;ite to that which he has &s;o ju&s;tly &s;atirized; I mean a credulity, which bu&s;ies it&s;elf with matter much more than with &s;pirit, which, totally di&s;regarding the incorporeal beings of another world, attaches it&s;elf to the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial living bodies of the earth we in|habit. The credulous Old Maid of the pre&s;ent time is one, who, in&s;tead of &s;eeing apparitions in the vacancy of air, &s;ees a lover in every man by whom &s;he is civilly acco&s;ted, and, in&s;tead of hearing death-watches,
<PB N="36" REF="52">
hears a hint at lea&s;t, if not an offer of marriage, in every common compliment that is ca&s;ually addre&s;&s;ed to her. I have known &s;ome unfortunate ladies reduced to a deplorable condition by a very &s;erious mi&s;con&s;truction of the mo&s;t trivial and un|meaning civilities.</P>
<P>Let me remark, however, that the cre|dulous Old Maiden is &s;eldom much affected by the lo&s;s of one imaginary lover; &s;he is, generally &s;peaking, a mo&s;t active architect, &s;upremely &s;killed in the ingenious and happy art of building ca&s;tles in the air, and, as fa&s;t as one fabric of amorous illu&s;ion is demoli&s;hed, &s;he erects another in its place. Her life is a &s;cene of perpetual and ever varying hope; and, as hope is one of the mo&s;t lively pa&s;&s;ions, her temper is na|turally gay. Her head may be compared to one of tho&s;e raree-&s;hew-boxes, which are filled with &s;plendid and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pictures of one magnificent object: at the fir&s;t peep you may di&s;cern the temple of Hymen; the &s;tructure pre&s;ently vani&s;hes, but di&s;ap|pears
<PB N="37" REF="53">
only to make room for a more capti|vating view, either of the temple it&s;elf, or of &s;ome delightful avenue, which is termi|nated by the &s;ame noble edifice. The cre|dulous Old Maid has a memory completely &s;tored with hi&s;tories of love at fir&s;t &s;ight; &s;he can recollect a thou&s;and in&s;tances in real life, as well as romance, of ladies who have made the mo&s;t &s;udden and fortunate conque&s;ts, by the &s;imple and natural cir|cum&s;tance of looking out of window, and &s;he, therefore, devotes her&s;elf, with parti|cular a&s;&s;iduity, to this favourite amu&s;ement. I know a &s;prightly ancient virgin of this de&s;cription, who, as con&s;tantly as my lord mayor's day returns, continues to plant her&s;elf in &s;ome con&s;picuous window of the city, and, as the fe&s;tive proce&s;&s;ion advances in her &s;ight, &s;he is animated with the hope of wounding an alderman or a &s;heriff: &s;he looks, indeed, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, as if &s;he was thoroughly convinced, that the ince&s;|&s;ant fire of her eyes did prodigious execu|tion upon the pa&s;&s;ing crowd; yet, I believe,
<PB N="38" REF="54">
if we except her intention, &s;he is as per|fectly innocent of metaphorical man-&s;laugh|ter, as the hone&s;t man in armour, who forms a part of the cavalcade, is innocent of blood. Fruitle&s;s as the experiment has hi|therto proved, &s;he is firmly per&s;uaded, that her de&s;tiny has ordained her to captivate &s;ome unknown lover, by the graceful action of leaning from a window; and, I am cre|dibly informed, that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a great part of &s;everal nights in that po&s;ition, at the time of tho&s;e outrageous riots, which threa|tened to lay the metropolis in a&s;hes. At the moment when other females of her neigh|bourhood had &s;tarted from their beds, un|der the terrific ideas of murder and confla|gration, this happier fair one was ob&s;erved to loiter in the mo&s;t ea&s;y attitude, at her open &s;a&s;h, with the enlivening hope of &s;triking &s;ome gallant hero, at the head of tho&s;e military parties who then paraded the &s;treets. Her night-dre&s;s was adju&s;ted with peculiar elegance for this purpo&s;e, and &s;he has ever &s;ince flattered her&s;elf with the a&s;|&s;urance
<PB N="39" REF="55">
of having made a very deep im|pre&s;&s;ion on the heart of a certain captain of the guards, who ki&s;&s;ed his hand to her at the time, and, according to her &s;uppo&s;ition, has only been prevented from a farther ex|planation of his love, by the unfortunate circum&s;tance of his having a proud and in|tractable old peer for his father.</P>
<P>There is one danger, to which the cre|dulous Old Maid, if &s;he happens to be rich, is particularly expo&s;ed; I mean, the very &s;erious danger ari&s;ing from tho&s;e vigilant and a&s;&s;iduous gentlemen, 'ycleped fortune|hunters, who think them&s;elves entitled to plunder an opulent and deluded female, in the character of a bridegroom. One of the mo&s;t wretched examples (alas! I wi&s;h I could &s;ay the only one!) I ever knew of this fatal credulity, was the unfortunate Flaccilla.</P>
<P>Flaccilla was a good-natured Old Maid, who inherited an ample fortune at a late &s;ea&s;on of life, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from her childhood, a romantic turn of mind. She happened to pa&s;s &s;ome months, in autumn,
<PB N="40" REF="56">
at the &s;eat of a nobleman, to whom &s;he was di&s;tantly related. The peer had lately re|ceived a new game-keeper into his &s;ervice, a &s;tout and enterpri&s;ing &s;on of Hibernia, who had &s;een, though under thirty, many vici&s;&s;i|tudes of life, and had &s;u&s;tained the active parts of a travelling valet, a common &s;oldier, and a &s;trolling player, before he engaged in his pre&s;ent occupation. The lively Patrick &s;oon contracted a great intimacy with the fair attendant of Flaccilla, who diverted him, in their vacant moments, by relating, with ludicrous humour, the whim&s;ies of her lady. The ingenious Hibernian, who had founded his amu&s;ement on the foibles of the maid, now determined to build his for|tune on the foibles of the mi&s;tre&s;s. Having arrayed him&s;elf in his new &s;uit of green, he &s;urpri&s;ed the tender Flaccilla alone, in a &s;e|que&s;tered &s;pot of her favourite wood, to which &s;he delighted to retire, for the con|venience of devouring a new novel without interruption. Patrick &s;oon prevailed on her to quit the vi&s;ionary tale for a more en|gaging romance. In &s;hort, he per&s;uaded
<PB N="41" REF="57">
her, that he was the &s;on of an Iri&s;h peer, in di&s;gui&s;e, who had only &s;ubmitted to his pre&s;ent humiliation to &s;ecure the extatic de|light, which he now enjoyed, of throwing him&s;elf at her feet. The &s;teady impo&s;tor played his part with dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s. The lady con&s;ented to elope&mdash;was married, and made mi&s;erable, before the activity of her friends could undeceive her. All, in|deed, that they were at la&s;t able to do for her was, to prevail on the rea&s;onable Pa|trick to leave his wife to reflect on her cre|dulous imprudence, and to bargain for a chance of future tranquillity at the expence of her fortune. Some incon&s;iderable &s;hare of this, indeed, &s;he was lucky enough to recover and retain; but her health and &s;pirits were impaired by the di&s;grace of her adventure, and her latter years were embit|tered by unavailing repentance for her ab|&s;urd credulity.</P>
<P>As the kind of credulity, which I am now &s;peaking of, is often founded on the mo&s;t arrogant and prepo&s;terous vanity, it is undoubtedly a fair &s;ubject for comic &s;atire,
<PB N="42" REF="58">
and it has not e&s;caped the la&s;h of our mo|dern dramatic authors. The &s;pirited little comedy of two acts, entitled, The Old Maid, has exhibited &s;uch credulity in a very ludicrous and lively manner. This foible of the antiquated virgin can hardly be ex|po&s;ed with more ingenious or more poig|nant ridicule; I &s;hall therefore proceed to con&s;ider it in the oppo&s;ite point of view, and to &s;hew, that this very foible, though ri&s;ing to a high degree of ab&s;urdity, may &s;till be an object more worthy of tenderne&s;s and pity, than of contempt and deri&s;ion. In&s;tead of being the offen&s;ive offspring of arrogance and vanity, it is frequently the mere baby of &s;implicity and benevolence: it often ari&s;es &s;olely from the mo&s;t natural and the mo&s;t amiable of human wi&s;hes, the wi&s;h of being beloved; and, when its ori|gin is &s;uch, who would not be tender to the child for the &s;ake of its parent? As hope is one of the mo&s;t potent of our illu|&s;ive pa&s;&s;ions, we cannot wonder, that the ju&s;t and laudable hope of finding a hu&s;band &s;hould often cheat the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="43" REF="59">
maidens into an erroneous belief of having found him. How often does the philo&s;o|pher delude him&s;elf in much clearer mat|ters, and where the &s;ilence of his heart af|fords him not &s;o good an excu&s;e for the confu&s;ion of his judgment! I have ob|&s;erved this ea&s;ine&s;s of belief, in &s;ome elderly virgins, &s;o perfectly free from every other blemi&s;h, that I could not but lament the raillery to which it is expo&s;ed. I have &s;een it united with &s;uch frames, that, in&s;tead of deriding it as a human weakne&s;s, I have been almo&s;t led to regard it as a gift from heaven, to compen&s;ate for the misfortunes of deformity. The young and incon&s;ide|rate cannot be expected to view it in &s;o &s;e|rious a light; but, to caution them from the danger of treating it with &s;uch unin|tended cruelty as they may afterwards re|gret, I &s;hall relate the brief hi&s;tory of a lady, who&s;e fate was as &s;ingular as her per|&s;on was unfortunate, and her character de|&s;erving.</P>
<P>Harriot A&s;pin was the younge&s;t of four
<PB N="44" REF="60">
&s;i&s;ters, who in their childhood had all a pro&s;pect of pa&s;&s;ing through life with every advantage that beauty and fortune can be|&s;tow. But de&s;tiny ordained it otherwi&s;e. The extravagance of their father abridged the portion of each, and the little Harriot had the additional affliction of per&s;onal ca|lamities. From a fall which her nur&s;e oc|ca&s;ioned, and concealed, &s;he contracted a great degree of deformity; and the injuries that her frame had received from accident, were completed in what her countenance &s;uffered from that cruel di&s;temper, by which beauty was &s;o frequently de&s;troyed, before the happy introduction of inoculation. Her countenance and per&s;on were wretchedly disfigured; but her mind &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t valuable of mental powers, and her heart was embelli&s;hed by every generous affection. Her friends were many; but &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed her fortieth year without once hearing the addre&s;&s;es of a &s;ingle lover; yet the fancied whi&s;per of this en|chanting pa&s;&s;ion often vibrated in her ear;
<PB N="45" REF="61">
for, with a &s;olid and brilliant under&s;tand|ing, &s;he was deeply tinctured with this cre|dulous foible. As &s;he advanced towards fifty, finding her income very narrow, and her &s;ituation unplea&s;ant, &s;he took &s;helter in the family of her favourite &s;i&s;ter, married to a good-natured man of ea&s;y fortune; who, though he had &s;everal children, very readily allowed his wife to afford an a&s;ylum, and admini&s;ter all the comforts in her power to this unfortunate relation.</P>
<P>The good deeds of benevolence rarely pa&s;s unrewarded. The obliging temper of Harriot, united to infinite wit and vivacity, contributed to re&s;tore the declining health of her &s;i&s;ter, and enlivened the hou&s;e, into which &s;he was &s;o kindly admitted. She endeared her&s;elf to every branch of it; but her &s;econd nephew, who&s;e name is Edward, became her principal favourite, and re|turned her partiality with more e&s;teem and affection than nephews are u&s;ed to feel for an old maiden aunt. Indeed, there was a &s;triking &s;imilarity in their characters, for
<PB N="46" REF="62">
they both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very uncommon por|tion of wit, with extreme genero&s;ity and good-nature. Harriot had the mo&s;t per|fect penetration into the foibles of every character but her own, and had the art of treating them with &s;uch tender and &s;alutary mirth, that &s;he pre&s;erved her nephew, who&s;e con&s;titution was amorous and vain, from a thou&s;and follies, into which the giddine&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ions would otherwi&s;e have betrayed him; and, what is &s;till more to her honour, when he was really fallen into &s;ome juvenile &s;crape, which &s;ometimes would happen, &s;he never failed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, both with &s;ecret advice, and the private aid of &s;uch little &s;ums of money as &s;he always contrived to &s;ave from her &s;lender income, for the mo&s;t generous of purpo&s;es. By her la&s;t benefi|cence of this nature, &s;he had enabled her nephew to redeem his gold watch, which Edward, who &s;tood in awe of his father, had actually pawned, to deliver a poor and unfortunate girl from a &s;punging-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="63">It was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to love a maiden aunt of &s;o engaging a character; and Edward, who&s;e affections were natu|rally ardent, loved her, indeed, mo&s;t &s;in|cerely; but his penetration di&s;covered her foible, and the vivacity of his &s;pirit often tempted him to &s;port with it. Hitherto, however, he had done &s;o in the mo&s;t harm|le&s;s manner; but a circum&s;tance aro&s;e, which fully proved the danger of this ordi|nary diver&s;ion. Edward, being a younger brother, was de&s;igned for the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic. He had &s;tudied at Edinburgh, and, returning from thence to London, had brought with him a medical friend, who was a native of Savoy, and was preparing to &s;ettle as a phy&s;ician at Turin. In the gaiety of his heart, Edward informed his aunt Harriot, that he had provided her with a hu&s;band; and he enlarged on the excellent qualities of his friend. The Sa|voyard was extremely polite, and, either attracted by the plea&s;antry of her conver|&s;ation, or touched with medical pity for the
<PB N="48" REF="64">
&s;triking infelicity of her di&s;torted frame, he had paid particular attention to Mi&s;s A&s;pin; for, being yet under fifty, &s;he had not a&s;|&s;umed the title of Mrs. This particular attention was full &s;ufficient to convince the credulous Harriot, that her nephew was &s;e|rious; but &s;he was unluckily confirmed in that illu&s;ion, by his &s;aying to her one even|ing, <Q>Well, my dear aunt, my friend is to leave England on Monday; con&s;ider, upon your pillow, whether you will pa&s;s the Alps, to &s;ettle with him for life, and let me know your deci&s;ion before the week expires.</Q> The &s;portive Edward was very far from &s;uppo&s;ing, that the&s;e idle words could be productive of any fatal event; for the health of his aunt was &s;uch, that he con&s;idered his propo&s;al of cro&s;&s;ing the Alps full as extravagant as if he had propo&s;ed to her to &s;ettle in the moon; but let youth and vigour remember, that they &s;eldom can form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the wi&s;hes, the thoughts, and feel|ings of infirmity!&mdash;Poor Harriot had no
<PB N="49" REF="65">
&s;ooner retired to her chamber, than &s;he en|tered into a profound debate with a fa|vourite maid, who u&s;ed to &s;leep in her room, concerning the dangers of cro&s;&s;ing the Alps, and the &s;tate of her health. In this debate, both her heart and her fancy played the part of very able advocates, and de|fended a weak cau&s;e by an a&s;toni&s;hing va|riety of arguments in its favour. They ut|terly overpowered her judgment; but they could not bias the &s;ounder &s;entence of Molly, who was &s;eated on the bench on this occa&s;ion. This hone&s;t girl, who happened to have a real lover in England, had many motives to di&s;&s;uade her mi&s;tre&s;s from an ex|travagant project of &s;ettling in a foreign country; and &s;he uttered as many rea&s;ons to poor Harriot again&s;t the pa&s;&s;age of the Alps, as were urged to the &s;on of Amilcar by his Carthaginian friends, when he fir&s;t talked of traver&s;ing tho&s;e tremendous moun|tains. The debate was very warm on both &s;ides, and &s;upported through the greate&s;t part of the night. The &s;pirited Harriot
<PB N="50" REF="66">
was horribly fatigued by the di&s;cour&s;e, but utterly unconvinced by the forcible argu|ments of her opponent. She even be|lieved that the journey would prove a re|medy for her a&s;thmatic complaints; her de&s;ire of a matrimonial e&s;tabli&s;hment was full as efficacious as the vinegar of Hanni|bal, and the Alps melted before it. At the dawn of day &s;he had po&s;itively determined to follow the fortunes of the amiable Sa|voyard. The peace of mind, which this deci&s;ion produced, afforded her a &s;hort &s;lumber; but on waking, &s;he was very far from being refre&s;hed, and found that her unhappy frame had &s;uffered &s;o much from the agitation of her &s;pirit, and the want of her u&s;ual &s;leep, that &s;he was unable to ap|pear at breakfa&s;t. This, however, was a circum&s;tance too common to alarm the fa|mily; for though her chearfulne&s;s never for&s;ook her, yet her little portion of &s;trength was frequently exhau&s;ted, and her breath often &s;eemed on the very point of depart|ing from her diminutive body. Towards
<PB N="51" REF="67">
noon, her &s;i&s;ter entered her chamber, to make a kind enquiry concerning her health. It was a warm day in &s;pring; yet Harriot, who was extremely chilly, had &s;eated her|&s;elf in a little low chair, by the &s;ide of a large fire. Her feet were &s;trangely twi&s;ted together, and, leaning forward to re&s;t her elbow on her knee, &s;he &s;upported her head on her right hand. To the affectionate que&s;tions of her &s;i&s;ter &s;he made no reply, but, &s;tarting from her reverie, walked with apparent difficulty acro&s;s the chamber, and, &s;aying, with a feeble and broken voice, <Q>I can never pa&s;s the Alps,</Q> &s;unk down on the &s;ide of her bed, and with one deep &s;igh, but without any convul&s;ive &s;truggle, ex|pired. Whether the much-injured and de|fective organs of her life were completely worn out by time, or whether the conflict of different affections, which had harra&s;&s;ed her &s;pirit through the night, really &s;hortened her exi&s;tence, the all-&s;eeing author of it can alone determine. It is certain, however, that her death, and the peculiar circum|&s;tances
<PB N="52" REF="68">
attending it, produced among her relations the mo&s;t poignant affliction. As &s;he died without one convul&s;ive motion, her &s;i&s;ter could hardly believe her to be dead; and as this good lady had not at|tended to the levities of her &s;on Edward, &s;he could not comprehend the la&s;t words of Harriot, till her faithful &s;ervant gave a full and hone&s;t account of the nightly conver|&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between her&s;elf and her departed mi&s;tre&s;s. As her nephew Ed|ward was my intimate friend, and I well knew his regard for this &s;ingular little be|ing, I ha&s;tened to him the fir&s;t moment that I heard &s;he was no more. I found him under the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of re|cent grief, and in the mid&s;t of that &s;elf-accu&s;ation &s;o natural to a generous &s;pirit upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. I endeavoured to comfort him, by ob&s;erving, that death, which ought, perhaps, never to be con&s;i|dered as an evil, might &s;urely be e&s;teemed a ble&s;&s;ing to a per&s;on, who&s;e unfortunate infirmities of body mu&s;t undoubtedly have
<PB N="53" REF="69">
been a &s;ource of ince&s;&s;ant &s;uffering. Alas! my dear friend, he replied, both my heart and my under&s;tanding refu&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe to the ideas, by which you &s;o kindly try to con&s;ole me. I allow, indeed, that her frame was unhappy, and her health mo&s;t delicate; but who had a keener reli&s;h of all the genuine plea&s;ures which belong to a lively and a cultivated mind, and &s;till more, of all tho&s;e higher delights, which are at once the te&s;t and the reward of a benevo|lent heart? It is true, &s;he had her foibles; but what right had I to &s;port with them? to me they ought to have been particularly &s;acred; for &s;he never looked upon mine, but with the mo&s;t generous indulgence. Poor Harriot! he would frequently exclaim, Poor aunt Harriot! I have ba&s;ely abridged thy very weak, but not unjoyous exi&s;tence, by the mo&s;t unthinking barbarity. I will, how|ever, be tender to thy memory; and I wi&s;h that I could warn the world again&s;t the dan|gerous cruelty of je&s;ting with the credulity of every being who may re&s;emble thee.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. On the Affectation of Old Maids.</HEAD>
<P>IN the li&s;t of tho&s;e foibles which mo&s;t frequently expo&s;e their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to ridi|cule and contempt, we may ju&s;tly place af|fectation; it a&s;&s;umes, indeed, a thou&s;and different &s;hapes, but in whatever form it appears, it is &s;o far from obtaining the af|fection or the applau&s;e, which it anxiou&s;ly &s;olicits, that it is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to render even youth and beauty di&s;gu&s;ting. What then mu&s;t its influence be, when it obtrudes it&s;elf upon our &s;ight in the &s;tiff fi|gure, and with the hard features, of the an|tiquated virgin? Yet the &s;ituation of the Old Maid has, perhaps, a particular ten|dency to produce and cheri&s;h this foible. Having found that her natural charms have not, in the &s;hort period of their bloom, been &s;o fortunate as &s;he wi&s;hed, &s;he may ea&s;ily be tempted to affect, either &s;uch graces as &s;he retains no longer, or &s;uch new
<PB N="55" REF="71">
attractions as &s;he thinks may become her maturer &s;ea&s;on of life. A minute ob&s;erver may perceive many different kinds of af|fectation in this &s;ingle character; but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to three, which I have par|ticularly remarked in the &s;i&s;terhood; and the&s;e are, an affectation of youth, an affec|tation of a certain cen&s;orial importance, and an affectation of extreme &s;en&s;ibili|ty. The fir&s;t, if not the mo&s;t ridiculous, is, I think, the mo&s;t common. We can|not enter an a&s;&s;embly-room, without &s;eeing many virgins of this de&s;cription, who, with the heavy wing of the beetle, affect the &s;portive motions of the butterfly. The kind-hearted Old Maid, who con&s;iders age as the great ob&s;tacle to that tender con|nection which is the object of her ju&s;t de|&s;ire, is tempted to hazard every expedient to conceal the advances of this inexorable power. But age is a jealous tyrant, and every effort of the faded virgin to proclaim her&s;elf free from its influence, tends only to make her feel the utmo&s;t &s;everity of its do|minion.
<PB N="56" REF="72">
I therefore entreat the &s;i&s;terhood to reflect, that every injudicious and un&s;ea|&s;onable attempt to plea&s;e, is generally pro|ductive of di&s;gu&s;t. I advi&s;e them to avoid every kind of per&s;onal decoration, which cu&s;tom has in any degree appropriated to youth, and, above all, the u&s;e of pink ri|bands, to which they have a particular pro|pen&s;ity. A wag of my acquaintance de|clares, that he looks upon every Old Maid, who arrays her&s;elf in ornaments of this co|lour, as a ve&s;&s;el di&s;playing &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, and inviting every bold adventurer to ha&s;ten to her relief; but, as the cruelty of man is apt to contemplate di&s;tre&s;s, of this nature without a particle of generous &s;ym|pathy, the pink en&s;ign, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is commonly hoi&s;ted in vain. Indeed, the juvenile Old Maid, if I may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, is &s;o perfectly blind to her real intere&s;t, that &s;he often condemns her&s;elf to the very &s;tate &s;he is trying to avoid, by ex|changing the natural charms, which &s;he might &s;till exert with &s;ucce&s;s, for the artifi|cial
<PB N="57" REF="73">
attractions which &s;he is eager to ac|quire. Co&s;melia will, I fear, be an unfor|tunate example of this melancholy truth. It has been the perver&s;e de&s;tiny of this lady, to lo&s;e all the advantages that might be ex|pected from &s;uperior endowments. She has appeared, through life, to de&s;pi&s;e the powers &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and endeavoured to fix her empire by tho&s;e &s;he had not. In youth, her per&s;on and features were &s;u|premely hand&s;ome; but at nineteen &s;he was a beautiful pedant, who&s;e tongue ince&s;|&s;antly counteracted the influence of her eyes. She then neglected her dre&s;s, in a di&s;gu&s;ting degree, to devote her&s;elf, with an ab&s;urd a&s;&s;iduity, to the acqui&s;ition of lan|guages. The&s;e, indeed, &s;he attained; but the chief effect &s;he produced by her learn|ing was, to frighten her young acquaint|ance, and a&s;toni&s;h an old &s;choolma&s;ter by her marvellous intimacy with the dialects of Greece.</P>
<P>Co&s;melia is now forty-&s;even. Her mind is enriched by a long commerce with the
<PB N="58" REF="74">
be&s;t of ancient and modern authors, and her per&s;on is &s;till very hand&s;ome; but her beauty and her knowledge &s;eem to be ren|dered ineffectual by her rage for appearing young. She now labours to conceal her erudition, with an affectation &s;uperior to what &s;he formerly &s;hewed in di&s;playing it. Notwith&s;tanding her early di&s;po&s;ition to pedantry, in the tender graces of epi&s;tolary writing &s;he is hardly inferior to the marchi|one&s;s de Sevign&eacute;; but this enchanting ta|lent &s;he very rarely exerts; for &s;he unluckily thinks, that, at her pre&s;ent time of life, a &s;mooth &s;kin is more worthy of care and im|provement, than a lively imagination.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of employing her pen in the compo&s;ition of &s;uch letters as would delight her friends, &s;he de&s;erts her corre|&s;pondents, and devotes a great portion of her time to the more intere&s;ting occupation of tickling her own forehead with a grea&s;y feather. Qualified as &s;he is to receive plea&s;ure from books, &s;he hardly ever adds a volume to her collection; but expends as
<PB N="59" REF="75">
much money as might purcha&s;e an elegant library, in ama&s;&s;ing all the various wa&s;hes that are &s;aid either to give or to pre&s;erve a very delicate complexion. She examines the adverti&s;ements for a new lotion for the face, with as much avidity as the curious Old Maid di&s;covers in looking into the li&s;t of marriages. Having tried all that the new&s;papers have celebrated, from the Milk of Ro&s;es to the Olympian Dew; as their effects, however, &s;eldom corre&s;pond with her wi&s;hes, &s;he is often tempted to try new inventions of her own, and &s;he fre|quently watches the &s;immer of a little pipkin, with as much eagerne&s;s and an|xiety as the alchymi&s;t u&s;ed to exhibit over the ve&s;&s;el that he expected to teem with his imaginary gold: I might add, indeed, with &s;imilar &s;ucce&s;s; for, whether devices of this kind have little or no efficacy in them&s;elves, or whether her raging pa&s;&s;ion for a clear countenance makes the &s;tronge&s;t co&s;metic appear defective, &s;he never at|tempts to render her&s;elf more fair, but &s;he
<PB N="60" REF="76">
grows more di&s;contented with her com|plexion. Such attempts, by leading her to look more frequently in her mirror, only confirm her more and more in that mo&s;t grievous apprehen&s;ion, that &s;he cannot ap|pear quite &s;o young as &s;he wi&s;hes to be thought. This apprehen&s;ion &s;eems to haunt her like an evil genius, and is for ever marring all the natural grace, both of her words and actions. In moments when &s;he had ju&s;t enchanted a little party of friends by her various talents, I have &s;een this un|fortunate foible &s;tart up, and di&s;&s;olve the &s;pell of plea&s;ure in an in&s;tant; &s;o that the per&s;ons who had for &s;ome time heard and beheld her with the highe&s;t admiration, began to &s;urvey her with an odd mixture of pity and deri&s;ion, which nothing but the deference due to her &s;ex and character in|duced them to conceal. This oppre&s;&s;ive dread of not appearing young, which is, in|deed, for ever pre&s;ent to her fancy, was re|markably con&s;picuous the other day, when &s;he &s;at for her picture to oblige a relation.
<PB N="61" REF="77">
When &s;he ca&s;t her eye upon the &s;ketch, after the fir&s;t &s;itting, in which the painter, to &s;ecure a likene&s;s, had given peculiar &s;trength to his outline, her vexation aro&s;e to agony; &s;he apprehended, that all the &s;pectators of her portrait would read the horrid words, <HI>forty-&s;even,</HI> in every line of her countenance. This idea continued to prey on her mind to &s;uch a degree, that when &s;he a&s;cended a &s;econd time into the &s;itting chair of the painter, her features ex|hibited more vi&s;ible terror, than tho&s;e lovely victims, Anne Boleyn and the Queen of Scots, are &s;aid to have di&s;covered when they mounted the block. Indeed, though her head was &s;ecure, &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as going to lo&s;e in effigy the mo&s;t precious part of it, namely, that fictitious expre&s;&s;ion of youth, which &s;he had ince&s;&s;antly la|boured to pre&s;erve; and her dread of this lo&s;s aro&s;e to &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing height, that &s;he had certainly fallen into an hy&s;te|rical fit, if an early peep at the improve|ment of the painter had not happily re|lieved
<PB N="62" REF="78">
her. His penetration had di&s;covered her foible; and, as he had known her inti|mately in her bloom, he generou&s;ly called his recollection to his aid, and gave, as he advanced, &s;o youthful an air to her face, that it harmoni&s;ed with the wreath of ro&s;es, and all the juvenile decorations with which &s;he had reque&s;ted him to adorn her re&s;em|blance. Her raptures encrea&s;ed with the encrea&s;ing beauty of the portrait, which became &s;o young and lovely in the la&s;t &s;itting, that the lady gazed upon her own image with &s;uch doating delight as almo&s;t entitled her to the name of an old Nar|ci&s;&s;us in petticoats.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this foible of Co&s;melia's, becau&s;e it over&s;hadows the lu&s;tre of a brilliant under&s;tanding, and a warm benevolent heart; it is a &s;ort of ma|lady, which, though wretched in its effects, if permitted to gain ground, appears at pre&s;ent to admit of a very ea&s;y cure. Let her cea&s;e to think of her own age, and the idea of it will never occur unplea&s;antly to
<PB N="63" REF="79">
the imagination of others. If &s;he could her|&s;elf once forget, that &s;he is turned of forty, &s;he has a thou&s;and attractions by which &s;he might make any man forget it, who&s;e recol|lection of &s;o unplea&s;ant a circum&s;tance &s;he might particularly wi&s;h to prevent. Let her di&s;card the artificial affectation of youth, and &s;he will find her&s;elf amply furni&s;hed with native powers to engage both e&s;teem and affection; for (if a pro&s;aic writer may be allowed to alter a ver&s;e of Pope for his convenience) we may affirm that Co&s;melia <Q>Di&s;gu&s;ts by nothing but a rage to charm.</Q></P>
<P>This is by no means the ca&s;e with the &s;econd kind of affectation, which I have engaged to con&s;ider, as being frequently found in the &s;i&s;terhood; I mean the affec|tation of cen&s;orial importance. The af|fected Old Maid of this character, in&s;tead of endeavouring to appear more airy and frolic&s;ome than time allows her to be, a&s;|&s;umes all the dignity of advanced life, and affects to &s;urvey, and to comment upon, the
<PB N="64" REF="80">
world with the a&s;perity of a Cato. The cen&s;orial &s;pirit, that I now &s;peak of, is en|tirely di&s;tinct from envy and ill-nature, which are to form the &s;ubjects of my fol|lowing chapter. I cannot more clearly ex|plain the peculiarities of this affectation, than by a little de&s;cription of Altamira, as &s;he is the mo&s;t &s;triking example of the foible that ever came within the &s;cope of my ob&s;ervation. Altamira is a tall virgin of forty-two, of a lank and pale vi&s;age, and with a neck as long and meagre as that of Cicero, whom &s;he al&s;o re&s;embles, not in|deed in the force and elegance, but in the length and volubility, of her orations; for, unluckily, having a barri&s;ter for her cou&s;in, &s;he has learnt to harangue on the real and imaginary failings of her acquaintance, with all the formality, and with all the a&s;|&s;urance, of a lawyer. She is frequently ob|&s;erved, in a large circle, &s;tretching forth all her length of neck, to que&s;tion &s;ome di&s;tant lady concerning the minute circum&s;tances of a &s;u&s;pected intrigue, or to inveigh again&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="81">
the irregularities of &s;ome per&s;on, who is ac|cidentally mentioned, and of who&s;e cha|racter &s;he has no real knowledge. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to behold her in this po&s;i|tion, without comparing her to a poor goo&s;e upon a common, who hi&s;&s;es at every pa&s;&s;enger without any provocation, without any de&s;ign to wound, and apparently with|out any purpo&s;e, but that of &s;hewing the awkwardne&s;s of its figure, and the di&s;&s;o|nance of its voice.</P>
<P>Envy and malevolence are &s;uch active principles, that we are never &s;urpri&s;ed, when per&s;ons under their influence indulge them&s;elves in de&s;canting on the frailties of their acquaintance: but Altamira is neither envious nor malignant; &s;he is uncommonly tall, and, as &s;he luckily thinks that a tall woman is the fine&s;t female production of nature, &s;he &s;ees nothing to envy in the per|&s;ons of the little women around her, and looks down upon the comparative pigmies with a kind of complacent contempt. The peculiar elevation of her own figure mi&s;|leads
<PB N="66" REF="82">
her into a mi&s;taken e&s;timate of her own &s;ex; but the &s;uperior elevation of her mind renders her perfectly ju&s;t towards ours. She does not appear to think, that the graces and talents of man are at all dependent on his &s;ize or &s;tature; and, &s;o far from de&s;pi&s;ing any of her male acquaint|ance, becau&s;e he is &s;horter than her&s;elf, &s;he has the good-nature and conde&s;cen&s;ion to &s;toop, for a &s;alute, to the mo&s;t diminutive of men.</P>
<P>I was once inclined to impute her offen|&s;ive affectation of cen&s;orial dignity to the mere habit of haranguing, which &s;he acci|dentally caught from her cou&s;in at the bar; or to a nobler motive, namely, that ardent admiration of virtue, which frequently leads its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or into &s;pirited, though injudicious invectives again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed adherents of vice: but my friend Sophronius, who loves to inve&s;tigate every nice di&s;crimination of character, and is very &s;hrewd in his remarks upon the &s;ex, corrected my mi&s;take. In our di&s;cour&s;e concerning the foible of Al|tamira,
<PB N="67" REF="83">
"You have &s;urely attended little to human nature," &s;aid my friend, "if you can &s;eriou&s;ly believe that Altamira's ince&s;&s;ant invectives again&s;t di&s;&s;ipation and inconti|nence, proceed from that purity and recti|tude of mind, which feels and delights in contemplating both the beauty and the bene|ficence of all the temperate virtues. If you &s;tudy her character more attentively, you will di&s;cover, that the rever&s;e of your idea is much nearer the truth. She perpetually declaims again&s;t the intrigues of inconti|nence, becau&s;e, under the ma&s;k of &s;uch de|clamation, &s;he acquires the privilege of treating her own fancy with tho&s;e licentious images, on which it loves to dwell; and, believe me, there are many preachers of her order in the &s;ame predicament."</P>
<P>Whether Sophronius was perfectly right in this &s;arca&s;tic cen&s;ure, I will not pretend to determine; but I think his remark may be of &s;ervice to the &s;i&s;terhood, and I hope it will caution them again&s;t launching forth into &s;uch intemperate orations as tho&s;e of
<PB N="68" REF="84">
Altamira, by &s;hewing them the con&s;truction to which her eloquence is expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But I quit this affected cen&s;or in petti|coats, to con&s;ider an affectation of a more gentle and in&s;inuating nature, I mean the affectation of extreme &s;en&s;ibility. The Old Maid is frequently tempted to counterfeit this &s;uperlative delicacy of feeling. I know a tender virgin of about forty-&s;ix, who, having read in divers poems and romances, that woman is irre&s;i&s;tible in tears, has &s;ome|how contrived to form an inexhau&s;tible re|&s;ervoir of water in the neighbourhood of her eyes, and, to captivate every new ac|quaintance, &s;he plays off tho&s;e two radiant fountains as readily as the ma&s;ter of a French garden entertains every foreign vi&s;itant by an occa&s;ional &s;hower from his favourite <HI>jet d'eau:</HI> the lady, indeed, has this great ad|vantage over the gardener, that her watery exhibition is never ob&s;tructed by accident; &s;he can at all &s;ea&s;ons command both the &s;hower and the apt occa&s;ion to introduce it; &s;he can pluck a withering flower from the
<PB N="69" REF="85">
no&s;egay in her bo&s;om, and drop a tear of tenderne&s;s in remarking the tran&s;ient beau|ties of vegetation; or, if &s;he finds not any occa&s;ion to weep, &s;he can talk of the &s;oft|ne&s;s of her own heart, and bring forth her tears by only thinking of the facility with which &s;he can produce them.</P>
<P>Nor does this affectation appear only in a &s;uperfluity of tears; it divides it&s;elf into many minute branches, and all the little airs and apprehen&s;ions of prudery may be referred to this &s;ource. I &s;hall not, how|ever, de&s;cend to a particular examination of the&s;e, but confine my&s;elf to a &s;ingle view of this foible in one of its mo&s;t whim&s;ical &s;hapes, I mean a prepo&s;terous fondne&s;s for the irrational parts of the creation. When the Old Maid has no real or imaginary lover, on whom &s;he can di&s;play this affected tenderne&s;s, &s;he is &s;ometimes contented to take a lap-dog, a parrot, or a monkey, as the object of her care&s;&s;es; or, if &s;he does not think a &s;ingle irrational companion a &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;titute for the noble creature of
<PB N="70" REF="86">
rea&s;on, &s;he collects a group of animals, and lavi&s;hes upon them tho&s;e delicate endear|ments, which &s;he has no opportunity of be|&s;towing upon man.</P>
<P>Orniphila is a lady who entertains her acquaintance with the mo&s;t &s;umptuous di&s;|play of this foible; for &s;he is unluckily po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch opulence, as enables her to indulge her mo&s;t extravagant caprice. Or|niphila was extremely hand&s;ome in her youth, and, as &s;he inherited both fortune and beauty, &s;he would probably have &s;ettled happily in marriage, had not the affectation of &s;uperlative &s;en&s;ibility rendered her more an object of ridicule than of de&s;ire. She had the misfortune to fancy, that true deli|cacy con&s;i&s;ts in an apparent debility of nerves, and &s;he therefore, with the figure of an Amazon, affected the timidity of a fairy. No gho&s;t could &s;tart with greater trepidation at the crowing of a cock. On the &s;udden beat of a drum, &s;he would throw her&s;elf into a kind of convul&s;ion; and &s;he has frequently wi&s;hed, that Heaven had
<PB N="71" REF="87">
made her the inhabitant of &s;ome more tran|quil globe, on which the air is never wounded by any &s;ound more powerful than the notes of a nightingale. This gentle|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition did not, as the lady might po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h, induce any &s;ympathetic &s;wain to amu&s;e her with the &s;oothing whi&s;|pers of love. She became an Old Maid; and, as &s;he approached the age of forty, perceiving that &s;he wanted &s;omething to care&s;s, &s;he began to provide her&s;elf with a train of animals, which &s;he has enlarged to &s;uch a degree, that her hou&s;e is a kind of little ark, though I believe it tends rather to de|&s;troy, than to pre&s;erve, the life of the various creatures it admits. Whether &s;he is of|fended by that neglect which &s;he has expe|rienced from mankind, or whether a pa&s;&s;ion for animals annihilates our regard towards our own &s;pecies, may admit of di&s;pute; but it is certain, that her attachment to birds, dogs, and monkies, which has grown, per|haps, from an affected tenderne&s;s into a real pa&s;&s;ion, appears to have rendered Orniphila
<PB N="72" REF="88">
utterly in&s;en&s;ible to the merit of human na|ture. She profe&s;&s;es to have an aver&s;ion to children, becau&s;e &s;he is di&s;tracted by their noi&s;e; yet, &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent is affectation, &s;he has cho&s;en for her con&s;tant companion, and even for her bedfellow, a great &s;urly Pome|ranian dog, who&s;e ince&s;&s;ant barking is more offen&s;ively loud than the mo&s;t noi&s;y infant that ever &s;qualled in a cradle! She has many nephews and nieces, to whom little pre&s;ents of money would be very accept|able; but Orniphila will not be&s;tow even a crown to treat one of the&s;e children with a play; yet &s;he will frequently throw away a guinea to purcha&s;e a little fruit from a hot-hou&s;e, as a delicious indulgence to her old talking parrot.&mdash;Our foibles, like our vices, are very fruitful &s;ources of vexation and di&s;tre&s;s; and I happened to be an ocular witne&s;s of a very heavy puni&s;hment, which accident inflicted on the unamiable weak|ne&s;s of Orniphila. As &s;he does me the honour to rank me among her di&s;tant re|lations, and as &s;he thinks I have &s;ome
<PB N="73" REF="89">
knowledge of natural hi&s;tory, &s;he lately &s;ent me a very pre&s;&s;ing invitation to tea, that &s;he might con&s;ult me on a new foreign bird ju&s;t pre&s;ented to her by one of her dependents. I was plea&s;ed to find two of her nieces, and their brother, admitted to her tea-table. The girls, who are almo&s;t women, were going from &s;chool to their parents in the country. The boy, a lively lad of thirteen, was ju&s;t arrived from Eton, to e&s;cort his &s;i&s;ters, and appeared to divert him&s;elf not a little with the oddities of his aunt. She is always &s;een, like Circe, &s;ur|rounded with animals. A few tame little birds, who fly unconfined about her cham|ber, are generally perched on her &s;houlder or her cap; the fat Pomeranian, when he is not growling, repo&s;es at her feet; and a large &s;quirrel occa&s;ionally peeps from her pocket, as he is indulged with a kind of banquetting-hou&s;e under her hoop: but of all the creatures who u&s;ually re&s;ide in her room, the mo&s;t &s;triking is a very large and magnificent, but ill-tempered mackaw.
<PB N="74" REF="90">
The two girls had contemplated the fine plumage of this bird with great admiration, which he appeared to return; for, allured perhaps by an ornament of flowers which &s;he wore in her cap, he hopped, on a &s;ud|den, from his &s;tand upon the head of the elde&s;t. The poor girl was exceedingly alarmed, and her brother ha&s;tened, with in|finite good-humour, to her relief. He, at fir&s;t, endeavoured to remove the bird very gently; but the mackaw did not chu&s;e to relinqui&s;h his prize, and, in a &s;cuffle which en&s;ued, tore off the thumb-nail of his oppo|nent. In the keen re&s;entment, which this violent angui&s;h produced, the young Eto|nian exerted all his &s;trength, and wrung off the neck of his antagoni&s;t, without a &s;ingle reflection on the feelings of his aunt. Or|niphila, who was utterly unaffected by the wound of her nephew, fell into extreme agonies on beholding the mangled body of her favourite bird; and, leaving all her gue&s;ts to take &s;uch care as they could of them&s;elves, &s;he &s;ummoned her &s;ervants to
<PB N="75" REF="91">
convey her in&s;tantly to bed, for the cala|mity rendered her unable to &s;upport her own frame. I have not &s;een her &s;ince, and nothing, I believe, will ever tempt me to vi&s;it her again, as I hear that, in&s;tead of atoning for her ill behaviour, &s;he &s;ent for her lawyer the next morning, and made him era&s;e from her will the name of the &s;pirited youth, who had excited her implacable re|&s;entment by ridding the world of her mi&s;|chievous mackaw. But if this little book engages her attention, as I intend it &s;hall, I tru&s;t it may induce her to correct her in|ju&s;tice, and to double the legacy which &s;he &s;o ha&s;tily cancelled.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here take an opportunity of doing ju&s;tice to my old acquaintance Petraea, who is &s;uppo&s;ed, by many people, to be a per|fect model of the refined affectation which I am now con&s;idering, and to boa&s;t of ex|qui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, with a heart harder than marble.</P>
<P>Petraea is perpetually engaged by a tra|gedy or a novel, which &s;he reads with infi|nite
<PB N="76" REF="92">
avidity, and a profu&s;ion of tears: you would &s;uppo&s;e her, in the&s;e moments, the open-handed daughter of pity; but, if the ideal hero or heroine, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es have convul&s;ed her bo&s;om with &s;ympathy, could &s;tart into real life, and a&s;k the &s;ympathetic Petraea for five &s;hillings, there would be an end of her &s;ympathy; her open heart would contract, and become as clo&s;ely puckered up as her pur&s;e. Yet the tenderne&s;s of Petraea is not affectation, as I once erro|neou&s;ly believed. Having &s;tudied her with attention, I am at length convinced, that her tender feelings are genuine, and that her true character, which is that of huma|nity, will always &s;hew it&s;elf in its natural colours, except when it is overclouded by avarice, that cold and gloomy pa&s;&s;ion, which is not only apt to &s;teal over advanced life, but to prevail more in celibacy than in wedlock! It was the following little inci|dent which confirmed my pre&s;ent opinion of Petraea:&mdash;During one of my vi&s;its to her, a clergyman came in, whom we both
<PB N="77" REF="93">
e&s;teem as a man of veracity and virtue. He told a &s;tory of &s;ingular di&s;tre&s;s, that had ju&s;t befallen a family not unknown to us. The facts were well related, and the lady was much affected; but, in the clo&s;e of his narration, the good man happening to drop a compa&s;&s;ionate hint of a five guinea &s;ub|&s;cription, the gu&s;hing tears of Petraea were &s;uddenly di&s;per&s;ed; her eyes became &s;e|vere; her lips, pale and trembling, began to mutter doubts concerning the worthi|ne&s;s which &s;he had ju&s;t acknowledged; &s;he then entered on a non&s;en&s;ical di&s;&s;erta|tion on the frequency of impo&s;tures, and the propriety of people's &s;uffering for im|prudence.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible divine perceived the rock on which his charitable hopes were now &s;plitting; and, avoiding it with great dex|terity, he pointed out to her a line of con|duct, in which her weight and intere&s;t might relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family without expending a &s;hilling. The heart of Petraea now opened again; &s;he cordially promi&s;ed
<PB N="78" REF="94">
her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and ultimately &s;ucceeded in the plan propo&s;ed, though it was attended with infinite trouble, which &s;he uniformly &s;upported with benevolent chearfulne&s;s and charitable plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not clo&s;e a chapter on affectation, without a few remarks on one &s;pecies of this foible, which de&s;erves my particular attention, not only as being peculiar to Old Maids, but as having a great tendency to injure &s;uch well-meaning authors as my|&s;elf, who, in treating &s;ubjects of extreme nicety, are unavoidably expo&s;ed to all the frowns and grimaces of prudi&s;h mi&s;con|&s;truction.</P>
<P>I mean the affectation of &s;uperlative de|licacy, both in &s;entiments and language. Many pure and prim virgins are betrayed, by this foible, into very ludicrous di&s;tre&s;s; they di&s;cover indecency in the mo&s;t inno|cent expre&s;&s;ions, and then di&s;tort their &s;tiff features at the terrific gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their own mi&s;conception: they exemplify, in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner, the maxim of Swift, that
<PB N="79" REF="95">
nice per&s;ons are full of na&s;ty ideas. In|deed, the head of the over-delicate Old Maid may be aptly compared to the foul ca&s;k, in which, according to the expre&s;&s;ion of Horace, the pure&s;t infu&s;ion immediately turns &s;our. By ladies of this de&s;cription, a word of the mo&s;t harmle&s;s &s;ignification is con&s;idered as ob&s;cene, and the language of religion her&s;elf is arraigned, as fit only for a brothel.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;ummate model, that I can recollect, of this common character, the over-delicate Old Maid, is a lady, who has been di&s;tingui&s;hed, for &s;ome years, among her acquaintance, by the appellation of Mi&s;s Delia Dainty. From her unparal|leled delicacy &s;he has obtained the rare privilege of pre&s;erving the title of Mi&s;s to the advanced age of &s;eventy. The extreme nicety of her ideas was di&s;played by the fol|lowing little incident, at the age of thirty|two: &mdash;Her father, a rich, hone&s;t, and rough country gentleman, inherited, from a more elegant uncle, a noble hou&s;e, with
<PB N="80" REF="96">
&s;ome admirable &s;tatues. In compliment to the ladies who vi&s;ited at this man&s;ion, the former ma&s;ter of it, a man of the polite&s;t manners, had thrown a little veil over every part of his marble trea&s;ures, where he thought the extreme freedom of ancient art could excite any painful &s;urpri&s;e in the mode&s;t fair ones of his neighbourhood. When the father of Mi&s;s Dainty &s;ucceeded to the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the &s;tatues remained in this decent &s;tate: it had been thought, that mode&s;ty her&s;elf could require nothing more; but Delia, who examined the&s;e fine works of antiquity with uncommon attention, di&s;covered a beautiful marble greyhound unprovided with a veil. As the animal was &s;itting in a very quiet po&s;ition, his late ma&s;ter had never entertained an idea, that any eye could be &s;tartled at his appearance; but calm as the creature &s;at, he alarmed the cha&s;te eyes of Delia, and her extreme deli|cacy induced her to furni&s;h him with a little apron of paper. The hone&s;t '&s;quire, her father, &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;trange apparel on
<PB N="81" REF="97">
his favourite &s;tatue, and rallied his daughter rather coar&s;ely on her new invention, as he called it, of putting a dog into breeches. It was reported, at the time, that the con&s;i|derate '&s;quire (who was very familiar and joco&s;e with a facetious divine, that lived with him as a chaplain) made the doctor an immediate offer of his daughter, with a hand&s;ome portion. The &s;tory went farther, and it was &s;aid, that the divine, who lived in the habit of returning his patron's jocu|larity, thanked him for the honour, but begged leave to decline it, declaring that he could never venture on &s;o delicate a wife, &s;ince he apprehended, that a lady, who required &s;uch decorum from a hound in marble, would hardly allow her hu&s;band to wear his no&s;e uncovered.</P>
<P>I will not vouch for the truth of this anecdote; but it is certain, not only that Mi&s;s Dainty has remained unmarried, but that &s;he has exerted her delicacy, on all oc|ca&s;ions, in pa&s;&s;ing a &s;evere cen&s;ure on the language of clergymen; who are very apt,
<PB N="82" REF="98">
&s;he &s;ays, even in the pulpit, to run into im|mode&s;t allu&s;ions. It was in con&s;equence of this wonderful nicety of apprehen&s;ion, that &s;he once &s;ent her Abigail, with an angry me&s;&s;age to the young curate of her pari&s;h, reprimanding him for having u&s;ed the word <HI>carnal</HI> in his la&s;t &s;ermon, and commanding him never to wound her ears any more by &s;o gro&s;s an expre&s;&s;ion. It happened, I think, about the forty-third year of her life, that &s;he refu&s;ed &s;ub&s;cribing to the charity for the propagation of the go&s;pel, becau&s;e the directors of that pious and noble in&s;titution in&s;ulted, &s;he &s;aid, every cha&s;te and refined ear, by u&s;ing a word &s;o very gro&s;s as the term <HI>propagation.</HI> The clergyman, who applied to her on this oc|ca&s;ion, was both piqued and diverted by her refu&s;al to contribute; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;hare of &s;atyrical humour, he thought proper to puni&s;h her uncharitable delicacy by an epigram, which was eagerly circulated among the lady's acquaintance.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. On the Envy and Ill-nature of Old Maids.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE hitherto con&s;idered only tho&s;e foibles in the ancient virgin, which ex|po&s;e her to deri&s;ion; I am now to &s;peak of more &s;erious defects, of qualities which ne|ver fail to render their unhappy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or an object of abhorrence. It is a common idea, I hope I may call it a vulgar preju|dice, that Old Maids are peculiarly infected with envy and ill-nature; and this general opinion may partly account for the extreme cruelty which the &s;i&s;terhood has experi|enced, for their being univer&s;ally treated, according to the ob&s;ervation of a great morali&s;t, "as the refu&s;e of the world." Little, indeed, would be their claim to compa&s;&s;ion and regard, if they were par|ticularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the&s;e dete&s;table characteri&s;tics; but I am firmly per&s;uaded,
<PB N="85" REF="101">
that, in the circle of every one's acquaint|ance, many individuals of this order may be found, who are not only free from the vices in que&s;tion, but eminently graced with the very oppo&s;ite virtues. If, in &s;peaking of Old Maids collectively, we mu&s;t allow them to be envious, we may at lea&s;t apologi&s;e for the &s;i&s;terhood, by ob|&s;erving, that they are not more envious than every cla&s;s of beings who &s;tand in a &s;imilar predicament. In the fine arts, it has been remarked through every age, that envy rarely fails to infect the tribe of un|&s;ucce&s;sful adventurers. In painting and &s;culpture, in mu&s;ic, and every branch of li|terature, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite productions of applauded genius have been in&s;ulted by the envious and malevolent &s;trictures of di&s;ap|pointed vanity. Now, the fair &s;ex may be con&s;idered as &s;tudents in the mo&s;t impor|tant and the mo&s;t delicate of all arts, the art of plea&s;ing; and, of cour&s;e, the Old Maid may be reckoned in the number of un&s;ucce&s;sful arti&s;ts, when &s;he has lo&s;t the
<PB N="86" REF="102">
chance of obtaining the golden chain of Hymen, that honourable prize, which &s;he has probably exerted her utmo&s;t &s;kill to acquire, and which is generally be&s;towed on every tolerable proficient in the art that &s;he endeavoured to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>Con&s;idered in this point of view, the Old Maid has generally a more rea&s;onable ground for di&s;content and invective, than the neglected painter or poet. The ap|plau&s;e of the public is not often mi&s;|placed: tho&s;e laurel wreaths, which are the chief incitements, and frequently the &s;ole rewards, of genius, are commonly be|&s;towed by the hand of ju&s;tice her&s;elf; but the chaplets of Hymen are promi&s;cuou&s;ly di&s;tributed by intere&s;t, ambition, and ca|price. The mortified and nece&s;&s;itous arti&s;t, who vents his &s;pleen again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;sful and opulent rival, is generally guilty of in|ju&s;tice and detraction again&s;t talents and indu&s;try far &s;uperior to his own; but the Old Maid, who is betrayed into envious expre&s;&s;ions concerning the comforts and
<PB N="87" REF="103">
the &s;plendor of the married dame, has often a better title to tho&s;e comforts and that &s;plendor, than the more fortunate lady by whom &s;he &s;ees them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Let us run this parallel a little farther, it will be found yet more to the advantage of the ancient virgin.</P>
<P>The failing arti&s;t is hardly ever wounded or provoked by the in&s;olent or contume|lious behaviour of an exalted antagoni&s;t. There is a magnanimity in true genius, more inclined to pity the vexations, and to relieve the nece&s;&s;ities, than to deride the weakne&s;s and incapacity of his un&s;ucce&s;sful competitors. It is ju&s;t the rever&s;e with the unfortunate Old Maid: her &s;olitary di&s;tre&s;s, and her curious ignorance, are for ever in|&s;ulted by the &s;upercilious knowledge, and the arrogant importance, of many luckier females, initiated in tho&s;e &s;plendid and ho|nourable my&s;teries, to which &s;he is unhap|pily a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>From the preceding view of their pe|culiar hard&s;hips and provocations, I may
<PB N="88" REF="104">
venture to a&s;&s;ert, that a &s;light tincture of envy is more pardonable in the &s;i&s;terhood, than in any cla&s;s of beings whatever.</P>
<P>I mean not to appear as the apologi&s;t of envy, when it exerts its mo&s;t baneful in|fluence, and bur&s;ts out into active malig|nity. When it grows to this height, it is at once the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and the mo&s;t odious of vices; ab&s;urd, becau&s;e it pur&s;ues torment for plea&s;ure, and odious, as the enemy of all &s;ocial delight. It certainly de&s;erves no quarter wherever it may be found, and particularly none when it exi&s;ts among the &s;i&s;terhood, becau&s;e there is hardly a creature to be found on the earth more dete&s;table in it&s;elf, and more perni|cious to all around it, than the active and officious Old Maid, who is for ever goaded by this malignant pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Envy is a di&s;ea&s;e mo&s;t prevalent in vain, in narrow, and uncultivated minds; and I have ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t envious of the ancient virgins are generally per&s;ons who, in their youth, have amu&s;ed them&s;elves
<PB N="89" REF="105">
with the mo&s;t haughty expectations, in con|&s;equence either of per&s;onal or pecuniary advantages. As the fine&s;t Burgundy, when &s;poiled, produces the mo&s;t poignant vine|gar, the &s;uperannuated beauty turns into the &s;harpe&s;t and mo&s;t acrimonious Old Maid; her ill-nature, in declining life, is proportioned to that proud and imaginary value which &s;he vainly &s;et upon her youth|ful graces. The neglect that tho&s;e graces have experienced, is an injury which ran|kles perpetually in her heart, and which &s;he is ever trying to revenge upon the world at large: &s;he has all the vindictive malevo|lence of Juno, and would gladly plunge the whole univer&s;e in di&s;&s;ention and mi&s;ery, becau&s;e &s;he thinks her&s;elf defrauded of that provoking fruit, which &s;he con&s;idered as due to her imperious beauty.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ituation, where a being of this re&s;tle&s;s nature may not exert, with a very mi&s;chievous effect, her malignant ac|tivity: but a country town is the proper theatre of the envious Old Maid; a theatre,
<PB N="90" REF="106">
where &s;he frequently exhibits a bu&s;y and bold malevolence, little inferior to that which Milton has &s;o finely made the cha|racteri&s;tic of Satan! If &s;he happens to be rich, &s;he rivals the arch-fiend in dignity, as well as in rancour, and has a &s;plendid pan|daemonium to receive tho&s;e &s;ubordinate &s;pirits, who are the ready mini&s;ters of her diabolical plea&s;ure: nor is it le&s;s the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of this a&s;&s;embly, than of the Miltonic pandaemonium, to wage an in&s;idious war again&s;t heaven, by attacking the lovely works of the Creator, and attempting to de&s;troy the happine&s;s of innocence and beauty.</P>
<P>The envious Old Maid is a complete proficient in the black art of detraction; and, if &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es both opulence and wit, all the evils that the ignorance of the dark ages imputed to witchcraft, are inferior to tho&s;e which her malicious &s;pirit has the power of producing. Her tongue is armed with a corro&s;ive venom, and, by its in&s;i|dious application, &s;he delights in di&s;&s;olving
<PB N="91" REF="107">
the ties of ancient friend&s;hip, in annihilat|ing the fe&s;tive bands of Hymen at the mo|ment of their formation, and in poi&s;oning all the fountains of &s;ocial plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>She may be ju&s;tly reckoned a real &s;or|cere&s;s, who &s;urpa&s;&s;es, in malicious power, the mo&s;t terrific of all the fabulous en|chanters. But it is not ea&s;y to give a per|fect de&s;cription of the many my&s;terious &s;pells, by which &s;he ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ues the gratification of her malice. Her favourite and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;truments of mi&s;chief are anonymous letters, tho&s;e in&s;idious de|&s;troyers of dome&s;tic peace, written under the fal&s;e pretence of a friendly concern for the very per&s;ons whom they are really in|tended to harra&s;s and torment! From the &s;ubtle fabrication of &s;uch letters, a lovely and innocent girl is abridged of her liberty by a rigorous and deluded parent; a lover is led to mi&s;tru&s;t the fidelity of his mi&s;tre&s;s; and the faire&s;t blo&s;&s;oms of affection are &s;haken &s;uddenly to the ground by the hand of that cunning envy, which, working for
<PB N="92" REF="108">
ever in the dark, is rarely puni&s;hed by a complete detection.</P>
<P>There are a thou&s;and petty modes of defamation, which derive a&s;toni&s;hing in|fluence from the ingenious acutene&s;s of the &s;arca&s;tic Old Maid. I have known a ma|levolent hag, of this order, contrive to &s;ully a very fair reputation, without uttering a &s;yllable, by one &s;ignificant glance of her eye, and an artful &s;hake of her head. This lady, indeed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon bit|terne&s;s of &s;pirit; and, as one anecdote of her life may afford an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to &s;ome of her &s;i&s;terhood, I &s;hall introduce her to the acquaintance of my reader, under the title of Mrs. Winifred Wormwood.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wormwood was the daughter of a ru&s;tic merchant, who, by the happy union of many lucrative trades, ama&s;&s;ed an enor|mous fortune. His family con&s;i&s;ted of three girls, and Winifred was the elde&s;t: long before &s;he was twenty, &s;he was &s;urrounded with lovers, &s;ome probably attracted by the &s;plendid pro&s;pect of her expected portion,
<PB N="93" REF="109">
and others truly captivated by her per&s;onal graces; for her per&s;on was elegant, and her elegance was enlivened with peculiar vi|vacity. Mr. Wormwood was commonly called a kind parent, and an hone&s;t man; and he might de&s;erve, indeed, tho&s;e ho|nourable appellations, if it were not a pro|fanation of language to apply them to a narrow and a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit. He indulged his daughters in many expen&s;ive amu&s;e|ments, becau&s;e it flattered his pride; but his heart was engro&s;&s;ed by the profits of his exten&s;ive traffic: he turned, with the mo&s;t repul&s;ive a&s;perity, from every propo&s;al that could lead him to dimini&s;h his capital, and thought his daughters unrea&s;onable, if they wi&s;hed for any permanent &s;atisfaction above that of &s;eeing their father increa&s;e in opu|lence and &s;plendor. His two younger children, who inherited from their decea&s;ed mother a tender delicacy of frame, lan|gui&s;hed and died at an early period of life, and the death of one of them was imputed, with great probability, to a &s;evere di&s;ap|pointment
<PB N="94" REF="110">
in her fir&s;t affection. The more &s;prightly Winifred, who&s;e heart was a per|fect &s;tranger to genuine love, &s;urmounted the mortification of &s;eeing many &s;uitors di&s;carded; and, by the in&s;en&s;ate avarice of her father, &s;he was naturally led into habits of artifice and intrigue. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an un|common &s;hare of very &s;hrewd and piercing wit, with the mo&s;t profound hypocri&s;y, &s;he contrived to plea&s;e, and to blind, her plod|ding old parent; who perpetually harangued on the di&s;cretion of his daughter, and be|lieved her a miracle of re&s;erve and pru|dence, at the very time when &s;he was &s;u&s;|pected of &s;uch conduct as would have di&s;|qualified her, had it ever been proved, for the rank &s;he now holds in this e&s;&s;ay. She was &s;aid to have amu&s;ed her&s;elf with a great variety of amorous adventures, which eluded the ob&s;ervation of her father; but of the many lovers, who &s;ighed to her in &s;ecret, not one could tempt her into mar|riage, and, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the public, the rich heire&s;s of Mr. Wormwood reached the
<PB N="95" REF="111">
age of thirty-&s;even, without changing her name. Ju&s;t as &s;he arrived at this mature &s;ea&s;on of life, the opulent old gentleman took his leave of a world, in which he had acted a bu&s;y part, plea&s;ed with the idea of leaving a large fortune, as a monument of his indu&s;try, but wanting the &s;uperior &s;ati&s;|faction, which a more generous parent would probably have derived from the happy e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a daughter. He gained, how|ever, from the hypocri&s;y of Winifred, what he could not claim from her affection, the honour of being lamented with a profu&s;ion of tears. She di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf by di&s;|playing all the delicate gradations of filial &s;orrow; but recovered, at a proper time, all the natural gaiety of her temper, which &s;he had now the full opportunity of in|dulging, being mi&s;tre&s;s of a magnificent man&s;ion, within a mile of a populous town, and enabled to enliven it with all the arts of luxury, by inheriting &s;uch accumulated wealth, as would &s;afely &s;upport the utmo&s;t efforts of provincial &s;plendor. Mi&s;s Worm|wood
<PB N="96" REF="112">
now expected to &s;ee every batchelor of figure and con&s;equence a &s;uppliant at her feet: &s;he promi&s;ed to her&s;elf no little entertainment in &s;porting with their ad|dre&s;&s;es, without the fear of &s;uffering from a tyrannical hu&s;band, as &s;he had learned cau|tion from her father, and had privately re|&s;olved not to tru&s;t any man with her mo|ney; a re&s;olution the more di&s;creet, as &s;he had much to apprehend, and very little to learn, from &s;o dangerous a ma&s;ter! The good-natured town, in who&s;e environs the rich Winifred re&s;ided, very kindly pointed out to her no le&s;s than twenty lively beaux for her choice; but, to the &s;hame or the honour of tho&s;e gentlemen, they were too timid, or too hone&s;t, to make any ad|vances. The report of her youthful fro|lics, and the dread of her &s;arca&s;tic wit, had more power to repel, than her per&s;on and her wealth had to attract. Pa&s;&s;ing her fif|tieth year, &s;he acquired the &s;erious name of Mi&s;tre&s;s, without the dignity of a wife, and without receiving a &s;ingle offer of marriage
<PB N="97" REF="113">
from the period in which &s;he became the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;o opulent a fortune.</P>
<P>Whether this mortifying di&s;appointment had given a peculiar a&s;perity to her temper, or whether malevolence was the earlier cha|racteri&s;tic of her mind, I will not pretend to determine; but it is certain, that from this autumnal or rather wintry &s;ea&s;on of her life, Mrs. Wormwood made it her chief occupation to amu&s;e her&s;elf with the mo&s;t &s;ubtle devices of malicious ingenuity, and to fru&s;trate every promi&s;ing &s;cheme of af|fection and delight, which &s;he di&s;covered in the wide circle of her acquaintance. She &s;eemed to be tormented with an ince&s;&s;ant dread, that youth and beauty might &s;ecure to them&s;elves that happine&s;s, which &s;he found wit and fortune were unable to be|&s;tow; hence &s;he watched, with the mo&s;t piercing eye, all the lovely young women of her neighbourhood, and often in&s;inuated her&s;elf into the confidence of many, that &s;he might penetrate all the &s;ecrets of their love, and privately bla&s;t its &s;ucce&s;s.

enabled to render her&s;elf intimate with the young and the lovely, by the opulent &s;plendor in which &s;he lived, and by the bewitching vivacity of her conver&s;ation. Her talents of this kind were, indeed, ex|traordinary: her mind was never poli&s;hed or enriched by literature, as Mr. Worm|wood &s;et little value on any books, except|ing tho&s;e of his counting-hou&s;e; and the earlier years of his daughter were too much engaged by duplicity and intrigue, to leave her either lei&s;ure or inclination for a voluntary attachment to more improving &s;tudies. She read very little, and was ac|quainted with no language but her own; yet a brilliant under&s;tanding, and an un|common portion of ready wit, &s;upplied her with a more alluring fund of conver&s;ation, than learning could be&s;tow. She chiefly re|commended her&s;elf to the young and inex|perienced, by the in&s;inuating charm of the mo&s;t lively ridicule, and by the art of &s;ea|&s;oning her di&s;cour&s;e with wanton innuendos of &s;o &s;ubtle a nature, that gravity knew

not how to object to them: &s;he had the &s;ingular faculty of throwing &s;uch a &s;oft and dubious twilight over the mo&s;t licentious images, that they captivated curio&s;ity and attention, without exciting either fear or di&s;gu&s;t. Her malevolence was perpetually di&s;gui&s;ed under the ma&s;k of gaiety, and &s;he completely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that plau&s;ibility of malice, &s;o difficult to attain, and &s;o for|cibly recommended in the words of lady Macbeth:
<Q><L>Bear welcome in your eye,</L>
<L>Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,</L>
<L>But be the &s;erpent under it!</L></Q>

her the faire&s;t opportunities of &s;e|cretly mortifying their in&s;ufferable pre|&s;umption. With a peculiar refinement in malice, &s;he fir&s;t encouraged, and afterwards defeated, tho&s;e amu&s;ing matrimonial pro|jects, which the young and the beautiful are &s;o apt to entertain. The highe&s;t gratifica|tion, which her ingenious malignity could devi&s;e, con&s;i&s;ted in torturing &s;ome lovely inexperienced girl, by playing upon the tender pa&s;&s;ions of an open and un&s;u&s;pecting heart.</P>
<P>Accident threw within her reach a mo&s;t tempting &s;ubject for &s;uch fiend-like diver|&s;ion, in the per&s;on of Amelia Nevil, the daughter of a brave and accompli&s;hed offi|cer, who, clo&s;ing a laborious and honour|able life in very indigent circum&s;tances, had left his unfortunate child to the care of his maiden &s;i&s;ter. The aunt of Amelia was &s;uch an Old Maid as might alone &s;uffice to re&s;cue the &s;i&s;terhood from ridicule and contempt. She had been attached, in her early days, to a gallant youth, who unhap|pily

lo&s;t his own life in pre&s;erving that of his dear friend, her brother: &s;he devoted her&s;elf to his memory with the mo&s;t tender, unaffected, and invariable at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ent; re|fu&s;ing &s;everal advantageous offers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r|riage, though her income was &s;o narrow that nece&s;&s;ity obliged her to convert her whole fortune into an annuity, ju&s;t before the calamitous event happened, which made her the only guardian of the poor Amelia. This lovely but unfortunate girl was turned of fourteen on the death of her fa|ther. She found, in the hou&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, the mo&s;t friendly a&s;ylum, and a relation, who&s;e heart and mind made her mo&s;t able and willing to form the character of this engaging orphan, who appeared to be as highly favoured by nature, as &s;he was per|&s;ecuted by fortune. The beauty of Ame|lia was &s;o &s;triking, and the charms of her lively under&s;tanding began to di&s;play them|&s;elves in &s;o enchanting a manner, that her affectionate aunt could not bear the idea of placing her in any lower order of life: &s;he
<PB N="102" REF="118">
gave her the education of a gentlewoman, in the flattering and generous hope, that her various attractions mu&s;t &s;upply the ab|&s;olute want of fortune, and that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the delight of &s;eeing her dear Amelia &s;ettled happily in marriage, before her death expo&s;ed her lovely ward to that poverty, which was her only inheritance.&mdash;Heaven di&s;po&s;ed it otherwi&s;e. This amiable wo|man, after having acted the part of a mo&s;t affectionate parent to her indigent niece, died before Amelia attained the age of twenty. The poor girl was now appa|rently de&s;titute of every re&s;ource; and ex|po&s;ed to penury, with a heart bleeding for the lo&s;s of a mo&s;t indulgent protector. A widow lady of her acquaintance very kindly afforded her a refuge in the fir&s;t moments of her di&s;tre&s;s, and propo&s;ed to two of her opulent friends, that Amelia &s;hould re&s;ide with them by turns, dividing her year be|tween them, and pa&s;&s;ing four months with each. As &s;oon as Mrs. Wormwood was informed of this event, as &s;he delighted in
<PB N="103" REF="119">
tho&s;e o&s;tentatious acts of apparent benefi|cence, which are fal&s;ely called charity, &s;he de&s;ired to be admitted among the voluntary guardians of the poor Amelia. To this propo&s;al all the parties a&s;&s;ented, and it was &s;ettled, that Amelia &s;hould pa&s;s the la&s;t quarter of every year, as long as &s;he re|mained &s;ingle, under the roof of Mrs. Wormwood. This lovely orphan had a &s;en&s;ibility of heart, which rendered her ex|tremely grateful for the protection &s;he re|ceived, but which made her &s;everely feel all the mi&s;eries of dependence. Her beauty attracted a multitude of admirers, many of whom, pre&s;uming on her poverty, treated her with a licentious levity, which always wounded her ingenuous pride. Her per|&s;on, her mind, her manners, were univer|&s;ally commended by the men; but no one thought of making her his wife. "Amelia," they cried, <Q>is an enchanting creature; but who, in the&s;e times, can afford to marry a pretty, proud girl, &s;upported by charity?</Q> Though this prudential que&s;|tion
<PB N="104" REF="120">
was never uttered in the pre&s;ence of Amelia, &s;he began to perceive its influence, and &s;uffered the painful dread of proving a perpetual burden to tho&s;e friends, by who&s;e genero&s;ity &s;he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; &s;he wi&s;hed, a thou|&s;and times, that her affectionate aunt, in|&s;tead of cultivating her mind with &s;uch dangerous refinement, had placed her in any &s;tation of life where &s;he might have maintained her&s;elf by her own manual la|bour: &s;he &s;ometimes entertained a project of making &s;ome attempt for this purpo&s;e; and &s;he once thought of changing her name, and of trying to &s;upport her&s;elf as an actre&s;s on one of the public theatres; but this idea, which her hone&s;t pride had &s;ug|ge&s;ted, was effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by her mode&s;ty; and &s;he continued to wa&s;te the mo&s;t precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetually wi&s;hing to change her mode of life, and of not know|ing how to effect it. Almo&s;t two years had now elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of her aunt, and, without any pro&s;pect of marriage, &s;he
<PB N="105" REF="121">
was now in her &s;econd period of re&s;idence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's under|&s;tanding was by no means inferior to her other endowments; &s;he began to penetrate all the artful di&s;gui&s;e, and to gain a perfect and very painful in&s;ight into the real cha|racter of her pre&s;ent ho&s;te&s;s. This lady had remarked, that when Mi&s;s Nevil re|&s;ided with her, her hou&s;e was much more frequented by gentlemen, than at any other &s;ea&s;on. This, indeed, was true; and it unluckily happened, that the&s;e vi&s;itors often forgot to applaud the &s;mart &s;ayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in contemplating the &s;weet countenance of Amelia; a circum&s;tance full &s;ufficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the mo&s;t bitter envy, hatred, and malice. In truth, Mrs. Wormwood dete&s;ted her lovely gue&s;t with the mo&s;t implacable vi|rulence; but &s;he had the &s;ingular art of di&s;gui&s;ing her dete&s;tation in the language of flattery: &s;he under&s;tood the truth of Pope's maxim, <Q>He hurts me mo&s;t who lavi&s;hly commends;</Q>
<PB N="106" REF="122">
and &s;he therefore made u&s;e of lavi&s;h com|mendation, as an in&s;trument of malevo|lence towards Amelia; &s;he in&s;ulted the ta&s;te, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared her&s;elf convinced, that he was a fool, becau&s;e he had not cho&s;en that mo&s;t lovely young woman. To more than one gentleman &s;he &s;aid, You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> marry Amelia; and, as few men chu&s;e to be driven into wedlock, &s;ome offers were po&s;&s;ibly prevented by the treacherous vehemence of her prai&s;e. Her malice, however, was not &s;ufficiently gratified by ob&s;erving that Amelia had no pro&s;pect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, &s;he re&s;olved to amu&s;e this unhappy girl with the hopes of &s;uch a joyous event, and then to turn, on a &s;udden, all the&s;e &s;plendid hopes into mockery and delu&s;ion. Acci|dent led her to pitch on Mr. Nel&s;on, as a per&s;on who&s;e name &s;he might with the greate&s;t &s;afety employ, as the in&s;trument of her in&s;idious de&s;ign, and with the greater chance of &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;he ob&s;erved that
<PB N="107" REF="123">
Amelia had conceived for him a particular regard. Mr. Nel&s;on was a gentleman, who, having met with very &s;ingular events, had contracted a great, but very amiable &s;ingularity of character:&mdash;he was placed, early in life, in a very lucrative commercial &s;ituation, and was on the point of &s;ettling happily in marriage with a very beautiful young lady, when the hou&s;e, in which &s;he re&s;ided, was con&s;umed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the de&s;|tined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nel&s;on, in lo&s;ing the object of his ardent affection by &s;o &s;udden a calamity, lo&s;t for &s;ome time the u&s;e of his rea&s;on; and when his health and &s;en&s;es returned, he &s;till con|tinued under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the pro|founde&s;t melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had lo&s;t in &s;o &s;evere a manner, &s;ugge&s;ted to his fancy a &s;ingular plan of benevolence, in the pro&s;e|cution of which he recovered a great por|tion of his former &s;pirits. This plan con|&s;i&s;ted in &s;earching for female objects of
<PB N="108" REF="124">
charity, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es had been occa&s;ioned by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private expences very mode|rate, he was able to relieve many unfortu|nate per&s;ons in this condition; and his af|fectionate imagination delighted it&s;elf with the idea, that in the&s;e uncommon acts of beneficence he was guided by the in|fluence of that lovely angel, who&s;e mortal beauty had peri&s;hed in the flames. Mr. Nel&s;on frequently vi&s;ited a married &s;i&s;ter, who was &s;ettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood re&s;ided. There was al&s;o, in the &s;ame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular e&s;teem. This lady, who&s;e name was Melford, had been left in very &s;canty circum&s;tances on the death of her hu&s;band, and, re&s;iding at that time in London, &s;he had been involved in additional di&s;tre&s;s by that calamity, to which the attentive charity of Mr. Nel&s;on was for ever directed: he more than re|paired the lo&s;s which &s;he &s;u&s;tained by fire, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;ettling her in the neigh|bourhood
<PB N="109" REF="125">
of his &s;i&s;ter. Mrs. Melford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was &s;till the mo&s;t valuable friend of that lovely orphan, who paid her frequent vi&s;its, though &s;he never re&s;ided under her roof. Mr. Nel&s;on had often &s;een Amelia at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politene&s;s, when|ever he vi&s;ited Mrs. Wormwood; a circum|&s;tance on which the latter founded her un|generous project. She perfectly knew all the &s;ingular private hi&s;tory of Mr. Nel&s;on, and firmly believed, like all the re&s;t of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but &s;he thought it po&s;&s;ible to make Amelia conceive the hope, that her beauty had melted his re&s;o|lution; and nothing, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, could more effectually mortify her gue&s;t, than to find her&s;elf derided for &s;o vain an expec|tation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to in&s;inuate, in the mo&s;t artful manner, that Mr. Nel&s;on was very particular in his civi|lities
<PB N="110" REF="126">
to Amelia; magnified all his amiable qualities, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t plea|&s;ure in the pro&s;pect of &s;o delightful a match. The&s;e petty artifices, however, had no effect on the natural mode&s;ty and diffidence of Amelia; &s;he &s;aw nothing that authori&s;ed &s;uch an idea in the u&s;ual polite|ne&s;s of a well-bred man of thirty-&s;even; &s;he pitied the misfortune, &s;he admired the elegant and engaging, though &s;erious man|ners, and &s;he revered the virtues, of Mr. Nel&s;on; but, &s;uppo&s;ing his mind to be en|tirely engro&s;&s;ed, as it really was, by his &s;in|gular charitable pur&s;uits, &s;he entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite engine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired, in her youth, the very dangerous talent of forging any hand that &s;he plea&s;ed; and her pa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;chief had afforded her much practice in this treacherous art. Having previou&s;ly, and &s;ecretly, engaged Mr. Nel|&s;on to drink tea with her, &s;he wrote a billet
<PB N="111" REF="127">
to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the mo&s;t perfect imitation of his hand. The billet &s;aid, that he de&s;igned him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing that afternoon at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wormwood, and reque&s;ted the favour of a private conference with Mi&s;s Nevil in the cour&s;e of the evening, intimating, in the mo&s;t delicate and doubt|ful terms, an ardent de&s;ire of becoming her hu&s;band. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia &s;hould not receive this billet till ju&s;t before dinner-time, that &s;he might not &s;hew it to her friend and confidant, Mrs. Melford, and, by her means, dete&s;t its fal|lacy before the hour of heir intended humi|liation arrived.</P>
<P>Amelia blu&s;hed in reading the note, and, in the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e of un&s;u&s;pecting inno|cence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Worm|wood; who bur&s;t into vehement expre&s;&s;ions of delight, congratulated her blu&s;hing gue&s;t on the full &s;ucce&s;s of her charms, and tri|umphed in her own prophetic di&s;cernment. They &s;at down to dinner, but poor Amelia
<PB N="112" REF="128">
could hardly &s;wallow a mor&s;el; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of plea&s;ure and amazement. The malicious impo&s;tor, enjoying her confu&s;ion, allowed her no time to compo&s;e her hurried &s;pirits in the &s;olitude of her chamber. Some female vi|&s;itors arrived to tea; and, at length, Mr. Nel&s;on entered the room. Amelia trem|bled and blu&s;hed as he approached her; but &s;he was a little relieved from her em|barra&s;&s;ment by the bu&s;ine&s;s of the tea-table, over which &s;he pre&s;ided. Amelia was na|turally graceful in every thing &s;he did, but the pre&s;ent agitation of her mind gave a temporary awkwardne&s;s to all her motions: &s;he committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politene&s;s of Mr. Nel&s;on led him to &s;ay &s;o many kind and graceful things to her on the&s;e petty incidents, that, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing her di&s;tre&s;s, they produced an oppo&s;ite effect, and the tumult of her bo|&s;om gradually &s;ub&s;ided into a calm and
<PB N="113" REF="129">
compo&s;ed delight. She ventured to meet ihe eyes of Mr. Nel&s;on, and thought them expre&s;&s;ive of that tenderne&s;s which pro|mi&s;ed a happy end to all her misfortunes. At the idea of exchanging mi&s;ery and de|pendence for comfort and honour, as the wife of &s;o amiable a man, her heart ex|panded with the mo&s;t innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her countenance, and gave &s;uch an exqui&s;ite radiance to all her features, that &s;he looked a thou&s;and times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Wormwood &s;aw this improvement of her charms, and, &s;ickening at the &s;ight, deter|mined to reduce the &s;plendor of &s;uch in&s;uf|ferable beauty, and ha&s;tily terminate the triumph of her deluded gue&s;t. She began with a few malicious and &s;arca&s;tic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes, which they frequently en|tertain, of an imaginary lover; but finding the&s;e remarks produced not the effect &s;he intended, &s;he took an opportunity of whi&s;|pering in the ear of Amelia, and begged
<PB N="114" REF="130">
her not to harbour any vain expectations, for the billet &s;he had received was a coun|terfeit, and a mere piece of plea&s;antry. Amelia &s;huddered, and turned pale: &s;ur|pri&s;e; di&s;appointment, and indignation, con|&s;pired to overwhelm her. She exerted her utmo&s;t power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her bo&s;om was too vio|lent to be di&s;gui&s;ed. The tears, which &s;he vainly endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s, bur&s;t forth, and &s;he was obliged to quit the room in very vi&s;ible di&s;order. Mr. Nel&s;on expre&s;&s;ed his concern; but he was checked in his benevolent enquiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who &s;aid, on the occa&s;ion, that Mi&s;s Nevil was a very amiable girl, but &s;he had &s;ome peculiarities of temper, and was apt to put a wrong con&s;truction on the innocent plea&s;antry of her friends. Mr. Nel&s;on ob&s;erving that Amelia did not re|turn, and hoping that his departure, might contribute to re&s;tore the interrupted har|mony of the hou&s;e, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood; who immediately flew to
<PB N="115" REF="131">
the chamber of Amelia, to exult, like a fiend, over that lovely victim of her &s;uc|ce&s;sful malignity. She found not the per|&s;on, whom &s;he was &s;o eager to in&s;ult. Amelia had, indeed, retired to her cham|ber, and pa&s;&s;ed there a very mi&s;erable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and &s;till more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which &s;he condemned with that exce&s;s of &s;everity &s;o natural to a delicate mind in arraigning it&s;elf. She would have flown for imme|diate con&s;olation to her friend, Mrs. Mel|ford, but &s;he had rea&s;on to believe that lady engaged on a vi&s;it, and &s;he therefore re&s;olved to take a &s;olitary walk for the pur|po&s;e of compo&s;ing her &s;pirits: but neither &s;olitude nor exerci&s;e could re&s;tore her tran|quillity; and, as it grew late in the evening, &s;he ha&s;tened to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her returned. Her worthy old confidant was, indeed, in her little par|lour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately
<PB N="116" REF="132">
betrayed her di&s;tre&s;s; and the old lady, with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s, exclaimed <Q>Good heaven! my dear child, for what have you been crying?</Q> "Becau&s;e," replied Ame|lia, in a broken voice, and bur&s;ting into a fre&s;h &s;hower of tears, <Q>becau&s;e I am a fool.</Q> &mdash;Mrs. Melford began to be mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, and, expre&s;&s;ing her ma|ternal &s;olicitude in the kinde&s;t manner, Amelia produced the fatal paper&mdash;"There," &s;ays &s;he, <Q>is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nel&s;on; it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been &s;uch an idiot as to believe it real.</Q> The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who, in her fir&s;t alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was her&s;elf greatly comforted in di&s;covering the truth, and &s;aid many kind things to con&s;ole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Amelia, <Q>that I am fooli&s;hly in love with Mr. Nel&s;on, though I think him the mo&s;t plea&s;ing as well as the mo&s;t excellent of men, and though I confe&s;s to you, that
<PB N="117" REF="133">
I &s;hould certainly think it a ble&s;&s;ed lot to find a refuge from the mi&s;ery of my pre&s;ent dependence, in the arms of &s;o benevolent and &s;o generous a protector.</Q> &mdash; <Q>tho&s;e arms are now open to receive you,</Q> &s;aid a voice that was heard before the &s;peaker appeared. Amelia &s;tarted at the &s;ound, and her &s;urpri&s;e was not a little increa&s;ed in &s;eeing Mr. Nel&s;on him&s;elf, who, entering the room from an adjoining apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tran&s;port of tenderne&s;s and delight. Ame|lia, alive to all the feelings of genuine mo|de&s;ty, was for &s;ome minutes more painfully di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this &s;urpri&s;e, than &s;he had been by her pa&s;t mortification: &s;he was ready to &s;ink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her &s;ecret to the man, from whom &s;he would have laboured mo&s;t to conceal it. In the fir&s;t tumult of this delicate con|fu&s;ion, &s;he &s;inks into a chair, and hides her face in her handkerchief. Nel&s;on, with a mixture of re&s;pect and love, being afraid of increa&s;ing her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eizes one of her
<PB N="118" REF="134">
hands, and continues to ki&s;s it without ut|tering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, almo&s;t as much a&s;toni&s;hed, but le&s;s pain|fully confu&s;ed than Amelia, beholds this unexpected &s;cene with that kind of joy which is much more di&s;po&s;ed to weep than to &s;peak:&mdash;and, while this little party is thus ab&s;orbed in &s;ilence, let me ha&s;ten to re|late the incidents which produced their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mr. Nel&s;on had ob&s;erved the &s;arcastic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Ame|lia, and, as &s;oon as he had ended his un|comfortable vi&s;it, he ha&s;tened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her &s;ome little ac|count of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and to concert with her &s;ome happier plan for the &s;upport of this amiable in&s;ulted orphan. <Q>I am acquainted,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>with &s;ome brave and wealthy officers, who have &s;erved with the father of Mi&s;s Nevil, and often &s;peak of him with re&s;pect; I am &s;ure I can rai&s;e among them a &s;ub&s;cription for the maintenance of this tender unfor|tunate

girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that &s;hall enable her to e&s;cape from &s;uch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to &s;upport a &s;ervant.</Q> Mrs. Melford was tran&s;|ported at this idea; and, recollecting all her own obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his genero&s;ity; and, &s;uddenly &s;eeing Amelia at &s;ome di&s;|tance, through a bow window, which com|manded the &s;treet in which &s;he lived, "Thank Heaven," &s;he cried, <Q>here comes my poor child, to hear and ble&s;s you for the extent of your goodne&s;s.</Q> Nel&s;on, who delighted mo&s;t in doing good by &s;tealth, immediately extorted from the good old lady a promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy: it was the be&s;t part of his plan, that Amelia &s;hould never know the per&s;ons to whom &s;he was to owe her independence, <Q>I am &s;till afraid of you, my worthy old friend,</Q> &s;aid Nel&s;on; <Q>your countenance or manner will, I know, betray me, if Mi&s;s Nevil &s;ees me here to-night.</Q> &mdash;"Well," &s;aid

the delighted old lady, <Q>I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will, probably, not &s;tay with me ten minutes; you may amu&s;e your&s;elf, for that time, in my &s;pa|cious garden: I will not &s;ay you are here; and, as &s;oon as the good girl re|turns home, I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexa|tion.</Q> &mdash;Admirably &s;ettled," cried Nel|&s;on; and he immediately retreated into a little back room, which led through a gla&s;s door into a long &s;lip of ground, embelli&s;hed with the &s;weete&s;t and lea&s;t expen&s;ive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amu&s;ement to Mrs. Melford. Nel&s;on, after taking a few turns in this diminutive gar|den, finding him&s;elf rather chilled by the air of the evening, retreated again into the little room he had pa&s;&s;ed, intending to wait there till Amelia departed; but the parti|tion between the parlours being extremely &s;light, he overheard the tender confe&s;&s;ion of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an
<PB N="121" REF="137">
irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, in the manner already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melford was the fir&s;t who reco|vered from the kind of trance, into which our little party had been thrown by their general &s;urpri&s;e; and &s;he enabled the ten|der pair, in the pro&s;pect of who&s;e union her warm heart exulted, to regain that ea&s;y and joyous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their faculties, which they lo&s;t for &s;ome little time in their mutual embarra&s;&s;ment. The applau&s;e of her friend, and the adoration of her lover, &s;oon taught the diffident Amelia to think le&s;s &s;everely of her&s;elf. The warm-hearted Mrs. Melford declared, that the&s;e occur|rences were the work of Heaven. "That," replied the affectionate Nel&s;on, <Q>I am mo&s;t willing to allow; but you mu&s;t grant, that Heaven has produced our pre&s;ent happine&s;s by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a &s;pirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil converted into the
<PB N="122" REF="138">
torment of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, I mu&s;t beg, that &s;he may not return, even for a &s;in|gle night, to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Worm|wood.</Q> Amelia pleaded her &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t obligations, and wi&s;hed to take a peaceful leave of her patrone&s;s; but &s;he &s;ubmitted to the urgent entreaties of Nel|&s;on, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when &s;he was united at the altar to the man of her heart. Nel&s;on had the double delight of rewarding the affection of an angel, and of puni&s;hing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in per&s;on to Mrs. Wormwood his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when that treacherous Old Maid had a|mu&s;ed her&s;elf with the hope of deriding her gue&s;t; who&s;e return &s;he was eagerly ex|pecting, in the moment Nel&s;on arrived to &s;ay, that Amelia would return no more.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aro&s;e almo&s;t to frenzy; &s;he racked her malicious and inventive brain
<PB N="123" REF="139">
for expedients to defeat the match, and cir|culated a report for that purpo&s;e, which decency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and de&s;pi&s;ed. Amelia was not only married, but the mo&s;t ad|mired, the mo&s;t beloved, and the happie&s;t of human beings; an event which preyed &s;o ince&s;&s;antly on the &s;pirit of Mrs. Worm|wood, that &s;he fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her mi&s;chievous and unhappy life, a memorable example, that the mo&s;t artful malignity may &s;ome|times procure for the object of its envy, that very happine&s;s which it labours to prevent!</P>
<P>If the envious and ill-natured Old Maid has a pa&s;&s;ion for ver&s;e, and has indulged her&s;elf in the habit of tacking ill-a&s;&s;orted rhymes together, &s;he frequently vents her malevolence in a mi&s;erable lampoon. I once knew an elderly virgin, who&s;e &s;pleen betrayed her into this dangerous kind of author&s;hip; and her fate was &s;uch, as ought
<PB N="124" REF="140">
to deter every rhyming &s;i&s;ter from &s;atirical compo&s;ition. This antiquated lampooner, in&s;tead of hurting the innocent and good-humoured female, whom &s;he made the heroine of her woeful &s;ong, injured only her&s;elf: &s;he actually rever&s;ed the ancient fable of Orpheus, and, in&s;tead of attracting all creation by the mu&s;ic of her lyre, in|duced every being to avoid her &s;ociety; till, finding her&s;elf unable to &s;upport the &s;oli|tude, which her poetry had occa&s;ioned, &s;he was obliged to abandon the town, where &s;he had re&s;ided from her childhood, and to take refuge in a di&s;tant county.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this long chapter with the remark of a famous Grecian philo&s;o|pher, which may have more influence in exterminating envy from the &s;i&s;terhood, than all the volumes that have been written on this very powerful and mi&s;chievous vice. "As ru&s;t con&s;umes iron," &s;aid Anti&s;thenes, "&s;o does envy the envious per&s;on." There cannot, I think, be a happier illu&s;tration of
<PB N="125" REF="141">
the effects produced by this corroding in|firmity. There is no pa&s;&s;ion that more darkly disfigures "the human face divine;" and I can a&s;&s;ure my fair reader, that when the ru&s;t of envy has been allowed to har|bour, for any length of time, in the lines of the vi&s;age, there is no lotion in the world that can re&s;tore the lo&s;t radiance. I there|fore entreat every Old Maiden, who feels an envious emotion ari&s;ing in her brea&s;t, to con&s;ider what hideous effects it may pro|duce in her countenance, and to reflect, that &s;he will improve her features by reco|vering her good-nature.</P>
<P>Having thus far expatiated on the pe|culiar foibles and defects of the &s;i&s;terhood, I &s;hall devote the &s;ub&s;equent part of this volume to the more plea&s;ing con&s;ideration of their amiable qualities, for amiable qua|lities they have, which are, like their foibles, peculiarly their own; and a writer, who involves either the whole &s;ex, or any cla&s;s of females, in one blind, undi&s;tingui&s;hing
<PB N="126" REF="142">
cen&s;ure, appears to me as ab&s;urd, as that per&s;on would be, who &s;hould pronounce a pine-apple a very bad fruit, becau&s;e he accidentally ta&s;ted only a piece of the rind, which had left a bli&s;ter on his lips.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. ON THE PARTICULAR GOOD QUALITIES OF OLD MAIDS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. On the Ingenuity of Old Maids.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE other antiquarians have la|boriou&s;ly employed and exhau&s;ted their powers in &s;earching for old ruins of Gothic architecture, or &s;ome Druidical re|mains, I have traver&s;ed the kingdom in que&s;t of curious characters in the &s;i&s;terhood of Old Maids, and, whenever I gain intel|ligence of a new curio&s;ity belonging to this cla&s;s, I for&s;ake all other occupations, to &s;tudy it with the patient attention of a true vir|tuo&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="144">As &s;oon as I am properly introduced to the fre&s;h ancient maiden, I &s;it philo&s;ophi|cally down, and endeavour to di&s;cover, through that incru&s;tation of little &s;ingula|rities which a long life of celibacy has pro|duced, her genuine character, the real di&s;|po&s;ition of her heart, and the exact altitude of her head.</P>
<P>Having made an accurate drawing of this piece of antiquity in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, I con&s;ider what &s;he mu&s;t have been in her youth; and, having &s;ettled my conjectures on that point, I proceed to reflections on the kind of wife &s;he might probably have made, and teach my&s;elf whether I ought to contemplate her pre&s;ent &s;tate with &s;atis|faction or concern.</P>
<P>Every man has his ta&s;te. Whether my &s;peculations may be &s;uperior or not to tho&s;e of more fafhionable antiquaries, is a point that I &s;hall leave the world to con&s;ider; I will only &s;ay, that if the &s;ociety of antiqua|rians &s;hould think this &s;tudy of mine may entitle me to be admitted of their commu|nity,
<PB N="129" REF="145">
I could enrich their Archaeologia with &s;ketches of many a fair neglected ruin, which have hitherto e&s;caped their re&s;earches.</P>
<P>With &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ketches I have, in|deed, attempted to adorn my own little vo|lumes; but others I &s;hall &s;till retain in my private cabinet, till I have happily awa|kened in our country a more lively and af|fectionate reli&s;h for the &s;ingular branch of <HI>virt&ugrave;,</HI> which I am now introducing, for the fir&s;t time, to the notice, and, I hope, the cultivation, of the enlightened public.</P>
<P>In the many years of profound &s;pecula|tion, which I devoted to the &s;tudy of Old Maids, before I began this elaborate, and, I tru&s;t, this immortal e&s;&s;ay, I ob&s;erved that the better part of the &s;i&s;terhood are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by three amiable characteri&s;tics&mdash; ingenuity, patience, and charity. To each of the&s;e I &s;hall give a &s;eparate chapter, and, as the &s;agacious Ari&s;totle &s;ays, in dividing a &s;ubject of le&s;s importance, <Q>first for the fir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Ingenuity may, indeed, be con&s;idered as
<PB N="130" REF="146">
a characteri&s;tic of the fair &s;ex in general; but there are many circum&s;tances which tend to weaken and dimini&s;h this quality in the married dame, and many which have an equal tendency to &s;trengthen and en|crea&s;e it in the ancient virgin. The for|mer may be compared to the high-fed and indolent prelate, who, having gained the object of his pur&s;uit, and being elated with the ceremonious dignity of his &s;tation, is apt to neglect the cultivation of tho&s;e &s;pi|ritual talents which ought to adorn it; the latter re&s;embles the unbeneficed eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who, con&s;cious of his humiliating condi|tion, endeavours to &s;urmount its di&s;advan|tages by the acqui&s;ition and di&s;play of tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which, if they do not rai&s;e him to a higher rank, may &s;ecure to him, undignified as he is, both attention and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common, than, to hear complaints again&s;t married ladies for hav|ing neglected tho&s;e ingenious pur&s;uits, by which their youth was di&s;tingui&s;hed: the
<PB N="131" REF="147">
harp&s;ichord and the pencil, tho&s;e plea&s;ing and graceful amu&s;ements of female life, are generally con&s;igned to oblivion in the &s;e|cond or third year after marriage; even a mu&s;ical voice, the mo&s;t delightful gift of nature, is &s;o frequently neglected in that bu&s;ine&s;s or di&s;&s;ipation which &s;ucceeds the fe&s;tivity of Hymen, that I have heard more than one hu&s;band upbraid his wife, for hav|ing forgot every favourite &s;ong, which, in their &s;ingle days, had a powerful influence in &s;ecuring his affection.</P>
<P>Now, with the more di&s;creet and good-natured Old Maids, the ca&s;e is ju&s;t the re|ver&s;e. I never met with even one ancient virgin, who, retaining her health and facul|ties, had cea&s;ed to practi&s;e any ingenious art, or to di&s;play any amu&s;ing accompli&s;h|ment, which had ever gained her applau&s;e.</P>
<P>That perfect lei&s;ure, and that exemption from all the more burthen&s;ome hou&s;hold cares, which the Old Maid enjoys, is highly calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t her progre&s;s in works of ingenuity; and &s;uch works, by detaching
<PB N="132" REF="148">
the mind from idle, impertinent, and cen|&s;orious ideas, contribute not a little to &s;up|port the natural benevolence of the heart, and to confer a con&s;iderable degree of hap|pine&s;s on many a worthy &s;pin&s;ter of gentle manners and of ea&s;y fortune.</P>
<P>The truth of this remark is very &s;trongly exemplified in the elderly daughter of Dr. Coral, a lady who&s;e conduct has been &s;o &s;ingular and amiable, that I &s;hall pre&s;ent to my reader a little hi&s;tory both of her and her father.&mdash;Dr. Coral was educated in the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, and took his degree in that &s;cience; but having a greater pa&s;&s;ion for what is curious, than for what is u&s;eful, he degenerated from a phy&s;ician into a vir|tuo&s;o. The country, in which he &s;ettled, &s;oon ob&s;erved that the Doctor was more di&s;po&s;ed to examine the veins of the earth, than to feel the pul&s;e of a patient: his practice of cour&s;e declined; but he was happily enabled to live without the aid of his profe&s;&s;ion, by the affluent fortune of his wife. She was a lady of a mild and en|gaging
<PB N="133" REF="149">
character, but of a delicate con&s;ti|tution, and, dying in child-bed, left him an only daughter, whom he called Theo|dora. The Doctor was by no means a man of warm pa&s;&s;ions, and never enter|tained an idea of marrying again; though a female fo&s;&s;ili&s;t once endeavoured to work upon his foible, and to entice him into &s;e|cond nuptials, by an artful hint, that an union of their two cabinets would enhance the value of both. Indeed, he had little or no occa&s;ion for conjugal a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for, being him&s;elf a mo&s;t active &s;pirit, he not only di&s;charged tho&s;e common offices of life which belong to the ma&s;ter of a family, but was able and willing to direct or execute all the minuter dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s, which is generally con&s;idered within the female de|partment. His activity, though, from the want of an enlarged under&s;tanding, it wa&s;ted it&s;elf on trifles, &s;upported the chearfulne&s;s of his temper. He was, indeed, frequently officious, but always benevolent. Though he had cea&s;ed to practi&s;e phy&s;ic at the &s;um|mons
<PB N="134" REF="150">
of the wealthy, he was eager, at all times, to afford every kind of relief to the &s;ufferings of the poor. He was gentle and indulgent to his &s;ervants, and as fond of his little daughter as a virtuo&s;o can be of any living and ordinary production of nature. Theodora di&s;covered, in her childhood, a very intelligent &s;pirit, with peculiar &s;weet|ne&s;s of temper. As &s;he grew up, &s;he di&s;|played a &s;triking talent for the pencil, and particularly endeared her&s;elf to her father, by &s;urpri&s;ing him with a very accurate and &s;pirited delineation of three the mo&s;t pre|cious articles in his cabinet; a compli|ment which &s;o warmed the heart of the de|lighted old naturali&s;t, that he declared he would give her five thou&s;and pounds on the day of her marriage. No one doubted his ability to fulfil &s;uch a promi&s;e; for though he had &s;quandered con&s;iderable &s;ums on many u&s;ele&s;s baubles, he was, in all com|mon articles of expence, &s;o excellent a ma|nager, that, in&s;tead of injuring, he had in|crea&s;ed his fortune; and from this circum|&s;tance
<PB N="135" REF="151">
he was generally believed to be much richer than he really was. Theodora had now reached the age of nineteen, and, though not a beauty, &s;he had an elegant per&s;on, and a countenance peculiarly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of &s;en&s;ible good-nature: her heart was &s;o very affectionate, that it not only led her to love her father mo&s;t tenderly, but even to look upon his whim&s;ical hobby-hor&s;e with a partial veneration. This &s;ingularity of &s;entiment contributed very much to their mutual happine&s;s, and rendered our gentle and ingenious dam&s;el not &s;o eager to e&s;cape from the cu&s;tody of a fanciful old father, as young ladies of fa&s;hion very frequently appear. Yet, happy as &s;he was, Theodora admitted the vi&s;its of a lover, who had the addre&s;s to ingratiate him&s;elf with Dr. Coral. This lover was a Mr. Blandford, a young man of acute un|der&s;tanding and poli&s;hed manners, &s;ettled in London as a banker, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be wealthy. He had been introduced to Mi&s;s Coral at an a&s;&s;embly, and &s;oon afterwards
<PB N="136" REF="152">
&s;olicited the honour of her hand for life. The Doctor, who was remarkably frank in all pecuniary affairs, very candidly told the young gentleman what he intended for his daughter, declaring at the &s;ame time, that he left her entirely at her own di&s;po&s;al; but, either from the favourable opinion he entertained him&s;elf of Mr. Blandford, or perhaps, from &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of approba|tion which had fallen from his daughter, the Doctor was very firm in his belief, that the match would take place; and, being alert in all his tran&s;actions, he actually pre|pared his five thou&s;and pounds for the bridegroom, before there was any imme|diate pro&s;pect of a wedding. Theodora was certainly prejudiced in favour of Mr. Blandford; yet, whether &s;he really felt a reluctance to for&s;ake her indulgent father, or whether &s;he con&s;idered it as dangerous to accept a hu&s;band on &s;o &s;hort an ac|quaintance, &s;he had hitherto given no other an&s;wer to his addre&s;&s;es, but that &s;he thought her&s;elf too young to marry. Blandford con|&s;idered
<PB N="137" REF="153">
this reply as nothing more than a mo|de&s;t preliminary to a full &s;urrender of her per|&s;on, and continued his &s;iege with increa&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity. In this very critical &s;tate of af|fairs, Dr. Coral was &s;ummoned to a di&s;|tance by a letter from a friend, who an|nounced to him the death of a brother vir|tuo&s;o, with a hint, that the Doctor might enrich him&s;elf by the purcha&s;e of a very choice collection of the mo&s;t valuable rari|ties, which, if he was quick enough in his application, he might po&s;&s;ibly obtain by a private contract. For this purpo&s;e, his corre&s;pondent had inclo&s;ed to him a letter of recommendation to the executors of the decea&s;ed collector. This was a temptation that Dr. Coral could not re&s;i&s;t. Without waiting for the return of his daughter, who was abroad on an evening vi&s;it, he threw him&s;elf into a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and travelled all night, to reach the man&s;ion of this departed brother in the cour&s;e of the following day, He was received very cordially by a rela|tion of the decea&s;ed, and &s;urveyed with avi|dity
<PB N="138" REF="154">
and admiration innumerable curio&s;ities, of which he panted to become the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. But as the collection was very various and exten&s;ive, the Doctor began to tremble at the idea of the &s;um, which the proprietors would unque&s;tionably demand for &s;o peer|le&s;s a trea&s;ure. The delight, with which his whole frame was animated in &s;urveying it, &s;ufficiently proved that he had a high &s;en&s;e of its value, and precluded him from the u&s;e of that profound and ingenious art, &s;o honourably practi&s;ed by the mo&s;t intelli|gent per&s;ons in every rank of life, I mean the art of vilifying the object which they de&s;ign to purcha&s;e. Dr. Coral, after com|mending mo&s;t of the prime articles with a generous admiration, demanded, with that degree of he&s;itation which anxiety pro|duces, if any price had been &s;ettled for the whole collection. The gentleman, who at|tended him, enlarged on the great trouble and expence with which his departed rela|tion had ama&s;&s;ed this invaluable trea&s;ure, and'concluded a very elaborate harangue in
<PB N="139" REF="155">
its prai&s;e, by informing the Doctor, that he might become the happy ma&s;ter of the whole on the immediate payment of three thou&s;and five hundred pounds. The Doc|tor was more encouraged than di&s;mayed by the mention of this &s;um; for, in the fir&s;t place, the price was really moderate; and, &s;econdly, he had the comfortable know|ledge, that he had the power of in&s;tantly &s;ecuring to him&s;elf the&s;e manifold &s;ources of delight. But the comfort ari&s;ing from this a&s;&s;urance was immediately de&s;troyed by the reflection, that all his ready money was devoted to the approaching marriage of his daughter; and his parental affection combating, with &s;ome little &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t his pa&s;&s;ion for virt&ugrave;, the good Doctor had almo&s;t re&s;olved to relinqui&s;h all ideas of the purcha&s;e. Unluckily, he took a &s;econd &s;urvey of the choice&s;t rarities, and met with an article which had been accidentally mi&s;|laid, and overlooked in his fir&s;t view of the collection&mdash;perhaps its pre&s;ent effect upon him was the greater from this ca&s;ual delay;
<PB N="140" REF="156">
certain it is, that this additional rarity fell with an amazing force on the wavering ba|lance of his mind; it entirely over&s;et his prudential affectionate re&s;olution, and, ha&s;|tily &s;eizing a pen, which lay ready in a ma&s;&s;ive ink-&s;tand of a curious and antique form, he in&s;tantly wrote a draught upon his banker for the three thou&s;and five hun|dred pounds.</P>
<P>At this pa&s;&s;age of my little work, I fore|&s;ee that many an hone&s;t &s;pin&s;ter, who may be reading it to her companions, will pau&s;e for a moment, and expre&s;s an eager de&s;ire to know what this wonderful rarity could be. When I inform her it was a very little box, containing the uneatable product of a tree, &s;he may, perhaps, imagine it a pip of the very apple which tempted our incon&s;i|derate grand mother:&mdash;Eve, indeed, may be &s;aid to have in&s;tituted the order of vir|tuo&s;os, being the fir&s;t of the many per&s;ons on record, who have ruined them&s;elves and their family by a pa&s;&s;ion for rarities.</P>
<P>But to return to her legitimate de&s;cen|dant,
<PB N="141" REF="157">
the curious Dr. Coral. This gentle|man con&s;idered, that if he neglected the pre&s;ent opportunity, he might never again be able to acquire the very &s;carce and mar|vellous production of nature, which he had long thir&s;ted to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which now &s;tood before him.</P>
<P>Not to teaze my fair readers with any longer &s;u&s;pence, I will directly tell them, the above-mentioned little box contained a vegetable poi&s;on, collected, with extreme&s;t hazard of life, from the celebrated upas-tree in the i&s;land of Java. A Dutch &s;urgeon had received this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure from the &s;ultan of Java him&s;elf, as a part of his reward for having pre&s;erved the life of a fa|vourite beauty in the royal &s;eraglio; and the &s;urgeon, on his return to Europe, had gratefully pre&s;ented it to the decea&s;ed vir|tuo&s;o, who had been the generous patron of his youth.</P>
<P>Dr. Coral was inflamed with the keene&s;t de&s;ire of beginning various experiments with this rare&s;t of poi&s;ons, without &s;u&s;pect|ing
<PB N="142" REF="158">
that it might deprive his daughter of a hu&s;band; taking, therefore, this ine&s;timable little box, with a few more of the mo&s;t pre|cious and portable articles in his new ac|qui&s;ition, and giving the nece&s;&s;ary direc|tions concerning &s;ome weighty cabinets of medals, and other more bulky rarities, he re-entered his po&s;t-chai&s;e with that trium|phant fe&s;tivity of mind, which can be con|ceived only by a &s;ucce&s;sful collector.</P>
<P>As the Doctor delighted almo&s;t as much in the idea of buying a bargain, as in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a rarity, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf, in his journey home, with various projects for the di&s;po&s;al of his ample trea&s;ure. It was his plan, to &s;elect the articles which he par|ticularly prized, and, by a judicious &s;ale of the remainder, to regain almo&s;t the whole &s;um that he had &s;o rapidly expended. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a high opinion of his own judg|ment in affairs of this nature, he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the apparent facility of his de|&s;ign, and, under the lively influence of the&s;e agreeable thoughts, he arrived at his
<PB N="143" REF="159">
own door. The affectionate Theodora flew with peculiar eagerne&s;s to receive him, having &s;uffered no little anxiety from his extraordinary ab&s;ence. The &s;prightline&s;s of his appearance &s;oon relieved her from all her &s;olicitude, and they entered the parlour very gaily together, where Theodora had ju&s;t been making tea for a female relation, and the a&s;&s;iduous Mr. Blandford.</P>
<P>The Doctor, like mo&s;t people of a bu&s;y turn, had a particular plea&s;ure in talking of whatever he did, as he never meant to do any thing that a man ought to blu&s;h for; and he now began to entertain his company with an account of his adventures: he en|larged with rapture on his purcha&s;e, inti|mating that it had co&s;t him a very large &s;um, and not mentioning his undige&s;ted &s;cheme of repaying him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving, however, that his narration produced a very &s;triking and gloomy change in the countenance of Mr. Bland|ford, he withdrew with that gentleman into his &s;tudy, and very candidly told him, that
<PB N="144" REF="160">
this recent and expen&s;ive-tran&s;action &s;hould make no material difference in the fortune of his daughter: he explained his intention of regaining the money by a partial &s;ale of the collection, and added, that as this mode of replacing the &s;um expended might not be very expeditious, he &s;hould more than compen&s;ate for the deficiency by a bond for four thou&s;and pounds, with full intere&s;t, and &s;trict punctuality of payment.</P>
<P>Mr. Blandford happened to be one of tho&s;e adventurous gentlemen, who, as they tremble on the verge of bankruptcy, inge|niou&s;ly di&s;gui&s;e the &s;hudderings of real fear under artful palpitations of pretended love, and endeavour to &s;ave them&s;elves from falling down a tremendous precipice by ha&s;tily catching at the hand of the fir&s;t wealthy and benevolent virgin or widow, whom they &s;uppo&s;e within their reach: he was a great projector in the management of ready money, and had rai&s;ed many &s;plen|did vi&s;ions on the expected fortune of Mi&s;s Coral; but the little box of poi&s;on, which
<PB N="145" REF="161">
the Doctor had brought home, converted his daughter, in the eyes of Mr. Blandford, into a &s;econd Pandora; and as that gentle|man had all the cunning of Prometheus, he re&s;olved, like the cautious &s;on of Japetus, to have no connection with the lady offered to him as a bride, becau&s;e he fore&s;aw the evils included in her dower.</P>
<P>Mr. Blandford, on this occa&s;ion, thought proper to imitate the policy of tho&s;e, who try to conceal a ba&s;e purpo&s;e of their own, by accu&s;ing another per&s;on of ba&s;ene&s;s: he upbraided Dr. Coral for having &s;hamefully di&s;appointed his very ju&s;t expectations, and, taking the &s;ubject in that key, he pur|&s;ued it through all the notes of high and artificial pa&s;&s;ion; which produced a &s;u|perior bur&s;t of louder and more natural anger from the hone&s;t in&s;ulted virtuo&s;o. Poor Theodora, in pa&s;&s;ing the door of the &s;tudy, heard the voice of her father &s;o unu|&s;ually violent, that, from a &s;udden impul&s;e of affectionate apprehen&s;ion, &s;he entered the room, where the two gentlemen were en|gaged
<PB N="146" REF="162">
in the mo&s;t angry altercation. Mr. Blandford &s;eized the opportunity of bidding his mi&s;tre&s;s an eternal adieu. While &s;he &s;tood motionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e, he made his final bow with a &s;arca&s;tic politene&s;s, ru&s;hed eagerly out of the hou&s;e, and decamped the very next day from the town, which con|tained the lovely object of his tran&s;ient adoration.</P>
<P>The approach or mi&s;carriage of an ex|pected wedding is a favourite &s;ubject of general conver&s;ation in every country town, and the di&s;union of Mr. Blandford and Mi&s;s Coral was very amply di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The &s;eparated young pair were univer&s;ally pi|tied, and the whole weight of popular re|proach fell immediately on the head of the unfortunate naturali&s;t. As he was a man, who, from the peculiarity of his pur&s;uits, withdrew him&s;elf from cards and common company, the little parties of the town mo&s;t eagerly &s;eized an opportunity of attacking his character: as a humori&s;t, he was ridi|culed, perhaps, with &s;ome ju&s;tice; as a man
<PB N="147" REF="163">
of unrivalled benevolence and active cha|rity, he was the object of much &s;ecret envy and malice, and of cour&s;e was very unju&s;tly vilified. The good people, who arraigned him on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, did not &s;cru|ple to repre&s;ent him, even to his daughter, as an unnatural mon&s;ter, who had &s;acrificed for a cockle-&s;hell the happine&s;s of his child. Nor was the little box of gum from the upas-tree omitted in the&s;e charitable remarks. One lady of peculiar &s;pirit a&s;|&s;erted, that if her father had robbed her of &s;o hand&s;ome a hu&s;band, for the &s;ake of pur|cha&s;ing &s;uch a rarity, &s;he might have been tempted to anticipate the old gentleman, in his experiments on the poi&s;on, by &s;ecretly preparing the fir&s;t do&s;e of it for him&s;elf. Happily for Theodora, &s;he had &s;uch gen|tlene&s;s and purity of heart, that every at|tempt to inflame her again&s;t her father &s;erved only to increa&s;e her filial affection. She reproved, with a becoming &s;pirit, all tho&s;e who in&s;ulted her by malignant ob&s;er|vations on his conduct; and, perceiving
<PB N="148" REF="164">
that he was deeply vexed by the late oc|currences, and the comments of the neigh|bourhood upon them, &s;he exerted all her powers, in the mo&s;t endearing manner, to di&s;&s;ipate his vexation. "It is true," &s;he &s;aid, as they were talking over the recent tran&s;action; <Q>it is true, that I began to feel a partial regard for Mr. Blandford; but his illiberal behaviour has &s;o totally altered my idea of his character, that I con&s;ider the circum&s;tance which divided us as the mo&s;t fortunate event of my life. I have e&s;caped from impending mi&s;ery, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing a happy e&s;tab|li&s;hment; and I have only to be thank|ful for this protection of Providence, if it plea&s;es Heaven to continue to me the power, which I have hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of promoting the happine&s;s of my fa|ther.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;he uttered this judicious and tender &s;entiment, a few &s;tarting tears appeared in evidence of its truth; they melted the good Doctor, and converted all his chagrin into
<PB N="149" REF="165">
affectionate pride and delight. The ju&s;tice of Theodora's ob&s;ervation was &s;oon after|wards confirmed in a very &s;triking manner, by the fate of Mr. Blandford, who plunging into all the hazardous iniquity of Change-alley, became at la&s;t a bankrupt, and with &s;uch fraudulent appearances again&s;t him, that the compa&s;&s;ion, which his misfortune might have in&s;pired, was lo&s;t in the abhor|rence of his treachery. Dr. Coral, who, by &s;tudying the inanimate wonders of the creation, had increa&s;ed the natural piety of his mind, was now mo&s;t devoutly thankful to Heaven for the e&s;cape of his child. The tender Theodora was &s;till more con|firmed in her partial attachment to the hou&s;e of her father; &s;he took a kind and &s;ympathetic plea&s;ure in a&s;&s;i&s;ting his fanciful pur&s;uits; &s;he per&s;uaded him to retain every article in his new purcha&s;e, which &s;he ob|&s;erved him to contemplate with particular delight; &s;he gave an air of uncommon ele|gance to the arrangement of all the curio|&s;ities which he determined to keep; and,
<PB N="150" REF="166">
by an ince&s;&s;ant attention to the peace and plea&s;ure of her father's life, mo&s;t effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed the felicity of her own. Their comfort and their amu&s;ements, being founded on the pure&s;t and mo&s;t permanent of human affections, have continued, with|out diminution, through &s;everal &s;ucceeding years. I &s;hould fill many pages in record|ing the &s;everal ingenious works and de|vices, by which Theodora has contrived to amu&s;e her&s;elf, and to delight her father; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that, being always engaged in occupations of benevolent ingenuity, &s;he is never unea&s;y; and &s;he has grown imper|ceptibly into an Old Maid, without enter||taining a wi&s;h for the more honourable title of a wife. Her mild and gentle pa|rent has &s;ecured him&s;elf from all the irk|&s;ome infirmities of age, by long habits of temperance, exerci&s;e, and, what is perhaps &s;tiil more &s;alutary, univer&s;al benevolence: he is &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his faculties, at the age of eighty-&s;even; and, if he has not the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing a numerous group
<PB N="151" REF="167">
of de&s;cendants, he beholds, however, with infinite delight, one virtuous and happy daughter, mo&s;t tenderly attached to him, and wi&s;hing for no higher enjoyment than what ari&s;es from their reciprocal affection.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t vi&s;it that I made to the&s;e two amiable and &s;ingular characters, I was at|tended by a lively friend, who loves to in|dulge him&s;elf in a laugh at every oddity that he meets with in human life. On our quitting the hou&s;e together, my companion concluded a few &s;prightly remarks, on the lady whom we had left, with the following quotation from Mon&s;ieur de la Bruyere: <Q>La fille d'un curieux e&s;t une r&acirc;ret&eacute;dont l'envie ne prend point de &s;e charger: elle viellit &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; du cabinet, &amp; m&eacute;rite, enfin, d'y avoir place au rang des an|tiques.</Q> &mdash; <Q>The daughter of a virtuo&s;o is a rarity that no one is very eager to po&s;&s;e&s;s: &s;he grows old by the &s;ide of the cabinet, and is at la&s;t entitled to a place within it, in the cla&s;s of antiques.</Q></P>
<P>"I grant you," I replied, <Q>that the daughter of my old friend, Dr. Coral, is
<PB N="152" REF="168">
the mo&s;t capital rarity in his collection, and one that I always &s;urvey with in|crea&s;ing plea&s;ure and e&s;teem: &s;he is, in|deed, a rarity, who&s;e very exi&s;tence, like that of the phoenix, I have heard called in que&s;tion; &s;he is <HI>a contented Old Maid.</HI> Extreme filial tenderne&s;s, and an active and elegant ingenuity, are the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing qualities in her very uncommon cha|racter; the&s;e qualities have rendered her the delight and &s;upport of an indulgent, but very whim&s;ical old father; they have enabled her to maintain an ea&s;y and a chearful &s;tate of mind, under tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, which many females would con&s;ider as particularly galling; they have enabled her, in &s;hort, to give an example to her &s;ex, that it is po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s a very u&s;eful and a very happy life, without a &s;hare in tho&s;e connubial ho|nours and enjoyments, which are erro|neou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed e&s;&s;ential to the happi|ne&s;s of woman.</Q></P>
<P>The condition of the autumnal virgin is &s;o highly favourable to ingenious pur&s;uits,
<PB N="153" REF="169">
that the Godde&s;s of Ingenuity, among the ancients, was her&s;elf an Old Maid; and, had there ari&s;en, in the days of antiquity, any genius as zealous as I am for the cha&s;te and elderly votaries of Minerva, he would certainly have left us an invaluable hi&s;tory of the &s;i&s;terhood, and a particular account of their various elegant works, and their ingenious inventions. But, to the &s;hame of pa&s;t ages, and to the glory of this my original e&s;&s;ay, let me remark, that I am the very fir&s;t author who has expre&s;sly devoted a literary labour to the&s;e choice and de|&s;erving objects of philo&s;ophic attention. The writers, indeed, of antiquity were by no means in&s;en&s;ible to the beauty or the merit of the fair &s;ex, and it would be ea&s;y to fill &s;everal pages with a bare catalogue of the many compo&s;itions which have been written in the prai&s;e of women. The fu|rious Amazon, the heroic matron, the wan|ton poete&s;s, and the voluptuous courtezan, are all immortalized in the works of many an ancient author; but even the mild and
<PB N="154" REF="170">
amiable Plutarch, who has written ex|pre&s;sly in honour of the &s;ex, has failed to celebrate the patient and ingenious Old Maid, a character who&s;e quiet and u&s;eful virtues give her a peculiar title to philo&s;o|phical panegyric.</P>
<P>Athenaeus has left us many curious and amu&s;ing particulars relating to tho&s;e illu&s;|trious ladies of plea&s;ure, A&s;pa&s;ia, Phryne, and Lais; to the la&s;t, a monument was erected on the banks of the river Peneus, and her epitaph is &s;till pre&s;erved. The vain and licentious Greeks, who paid the&s;e honours to an in&s;olent and rapacious cour|tezan, committed, I apprehend, to the fu|neral pile, many a gentle and ingenious antiquated virgin, without either lamenting her lo&s;s or recording her accompli&s;hments. But I &s;hall enlarge on this topic in a &s;ub|&s;equent volume, as I mean to take a gene|ral &s;urvey of the treatment which Old Maids have met with in the different ages and regions of tlie world: I &s;hall confine inyfelf at prefent to the &s;ubject more im|mediately
<PB N="155" REF="171">
before me, the ingenuity of the &s;i&s;terhood.</P>
<P>The arts of mu&s;ic, painting, and poetry, tho&s;e general &s;oothers of human care, are eminently u&s;eful to the ancient virgin; each of the&s;e three enchanting &s;i&s;ter-arts is endued with the power of di&s;&s;ipating that re&s;tle&s;s languor, which a &s;olitary condition is &s;o apt to produce; each is able to check, and to eradicate, tho&s;e maladies, to which the female frame is particularly &s;ubject, when the heart is vacant, and the mind unemployed.</P>
<P>In the more active and le&s;s &s;ickly days of antiquity, a Grecian lady, who was a na|tive of Argos, and who&s;e name was Tele|&s;illa, labouring under a very infirm &s;tate of health, con&s;ulted an oracle for relief; the an&s;wer &s;he received was, a direction to de|vote her&s;elf to the Mu&s;es, with an a&s;&s;urance that &s;he would find them the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful phy&s;icians. She obeyed this divine in|junction, and was &s;o completely re&s;tored, that &s;he not only gained the highe&s;t honour
<PB N="156" REF="172">
by many admirable ver&s;es, but was enabled to pre&s;erve her country from ruin by a &s;ignal exertion of heroic &s;pirit. When Argos, who&s;e warriors were engaged in a di&s;tant enterprize, was invaded by the Spartans, Tele&s;illa a&s;&s;embled, and animated her countrywomen to the defence of their native city; and obtained the glory of re|pelling the invaders, though led to the a&s;&s;ault by the two kings of Sparta, Cleo|menes and Demaratus. Whether Tele&s;illa was, at this juncture, an Old Maid or not, the candid Plutarch, who relates her ex|ploit in his treati&s;e on the virtues of wo|men, has forgot to inform us. In&s;tead of entering into critical conjectures on a point &s;o difficult to determine, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with advi&s;ing all my fair readers, who may labour; like Tele&s;illa, under an oppre&s;&s;ive derangement of health, without a particular name, or a medicinal remedy, to follow her happy example, and attempt their own cure, by devoting them&s;elves to the mu&s;es; or, in other words, to forget and
<PB N="157" REF="173">
lo&s;e their petty maladies in a &s;teady appli|cation to any elegant and feminine art, in which nature and education may have pre|pared them to excel. Our own age and country may furni&s;h me with more than one &s;ignal proof, that the divinities of Par|na&s;&s;us are &s;ometimes highly propitious to the cha&s;te and mature votaries of Minerva: not to mention the philo&s;ophic and poetical lady to whom the&s;e volumes are addre&s;&s;ed, I am credibly informed, that two other mo&s;t eminent female poets of our nation may probably become very honourable members of that &s;i&s;terhood, in who&s;e &s;er|vice I am writing; and it enhances the ob|ligations which the literary world is &s;till re|ceiving from the&s;e fair and delightful au|thors, that, endued, as I am told they are, with per&s;onal as well as mental attractions, they have declined to engage in the alluring rites of Hymen, for the &s;ake of devoting them&s;elves, with an undivided ardour, to the more glorious, yet le&s;s tempting, &s;er|vice of Apollo and the Nine.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="174">While I am thus zealou&s;ly recommend|ing ingenious occupations to the whole community of autumnal virgins, let me pay due regard to needle-work, that peculiar province of the fair &s;ex, on which our an|ce&s;tors wi&s;ely &s;et &s;o much value. If the ladies of our time do not work with that patient a&s;&s;iduity, which our good grand|mothers exerted, they have happily ac|quired the art of executing more graceful performances; the many excellent pictures, which we have lately &s;een produced by the needle, will, I hope, encourage our fair countrywomen to per&s;evere; in a branch of art which is peculiarly their own, and in which they cannot be mortified by the jea|lous and arrogant rival&s;hip of man.</P>
<P>The needle, indeed, has one great ad|vantage over the pencil and the lyre; it is not the mere in&s;trument of decoration or amu&s;ement; it can an&s;wer the mo&s;t ordi|nary, as well as the mo&s;t refined, purpo&s;es, and is equally conducive to utility and de|light. In commending to the &s;i&s;terhood
<PB N="159" REF="175">
all the employments of ingenuity, let me reque&s;t my fair reader to give the pre|ference to tho&s;e which are peculiarly be|coming. If a worthy &s;pin&s;ter has a talent for mu&s;ic, let her adhere to &s;uch graceful in&s;truments as belong to her &s;ex, and avoid the example of an Engli&s;h lady, whom I &s;aw, many years ago, di&s;playing to her ac|quaintance the unfeminine accompli&s;hment of beating a drum. For the rejection of every ungraceful amu&s;ement, the maiden &s;i&s;terhood has the high authority of their patrone&s;s, Minerva. We are told, that when this &s;age godde&s;s beheld her&s;elf play|ing on the pipe, which &s;he had ju&s;t invented, &s;he was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted by the di&s;tortion which it produced in her countenance, that &s;he in|dignantly threw her recent and ingenious invention into that watery mirror, which had pre&s;ented to her the reflection of her own bloated cheeks.</P>
<P>There may, however, be great and extra|ordinary occa&s;ions, on which the &s;incere Old Maid may obtain &s;ignal honour by exerting her ingenuity in violation of the
<PB N="160" REF="176">
graces; and I &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter by a memorable example of this important truth. It is recorded by an hi&s;torian of the dark ages, who&s;e name I am at pre&s;ent unable to recollect, that two illu&s;trious virgins, con|fined in a be&s;ieged city, were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by infinite apprehen&s;ions of indecent outrage, when the victorious enemy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place; but their ingenuity &s;ugge&s;ted to them a fortunate, though uncleanly ex|pedient, by which their cha&s;tity was pre|&s;erved; they covered their bo&s;oms with the &s;lices of a putrified chicken. The con&s;e|quence was, that the licentious &s;oldier, who ru&s;hed to their embrace, was repelled by the idea of pe&s;tilent di&s;ea&s;e, and they hap|pily e&s;caped the injury they dreaded, by being con&s;idered as objects of abhorrence in&s;tead of de&s;ire. That the&s;e virtuous, though deceitful, ladies were virgins, I am confident; but whether they were really Old Maids or not, as I relate the anecdote only from memory, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the conjectures of the ingenious reader.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. On the Patience of Old Maids.</HEAD>
<P>I REMEMBER to have heard it &s;aid by a late eminent anatomi&s;t, in a pro|fe&s;&s;ional di&s;cour&s;e on the female frame, that it almo&s;t appeared an act of cruelty in na|ture to produce &s;uch a being as woman. This remark may, indeed, be the natural exclamation of refined &s;en&s;ibility, in con|templating the various maladies to which a creature of &s;uch delicate organs is ine|vitably expo&s;ed; but if we take a more en|larged &s;urvey of human exi&s;tence, we &s;hall be far from di&s;covering any ju&s;t rea&s;on to arraign the benevolence of its provi|dent and gracious author. If the de|licacy of woman mu&s;t render her familiar with pain and &s;ickne&s;s, let us remember, that her charms, her plea&s;ures, and her happine&s;s, ari&s;e al&s;o from the &s;ame attrac|tive
<PB N="162" REF="178">
quality; &s;he is a being, to u&s;e the for|cible and elegant expre&s;&s;ion of a poet, <Q>Fine by defect, and amiably weak.</Q></P>
<P>There is, perhaps, no charm, by which &s;he more effectually &s;ecures the tender ad|miration and the la&s;ting love of the more hardy &s;ex, than her &s;uperior endurance, her mild and graceful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the com|mon evils of life. Nor is this the &s;ole ad|vantage &s;he derives from her gentle forti|tude; it is the prerogative of this lovely virtue to lighten the pre&s;&s;ure of all tho&s;e incorrigible evils, which it chearfully en|dures. The frame of man may be com|pared to the &s;turdy oak, which is often &s;hattered by re&s;i&s;ting the tempe&s;t; woman is the pliant o&s;ier, which, in bending to the &s;torm, eludes its violence.</P>
<P>The accurate ob&s;ervers of human nature will readily allow, that patience is mo&s;t eminently the characteri&s;tic of woman. To what a &s;ublime and a&s;toni&s;hing height this virtue has been carried by beings of
<PB N="163" REF="179">
the mo&s;t delicate texture, we have &s;triking examples in the hi&s;tory of the many virgin martyrs, who were expo&s;ed, in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity, to the mo&s;t barbarous and lingering tortures. Nor was it only from Chri&s;tian zeal, that woman derived the power of defying the utmo&s;t rigors of per|&s;ecution with invincible fortitude: Saint Ambro&s;e, in his elaborate and pious trea|ti&s;e on virgins, records the re&s;olution of a fair di&s;ciple of Pythagoras, who, being &s;e|verely urged by a tyrant to reveal the &s;e|crets of her &s;ect, to convince him that no torments &s;hould reduce her to &s;o unworthy a breach of her vow, bit her own tongue a&s;under, and darted it in the face of heir oppre&s;&s;or. In con&s;equence of tho&s;e happy changes, which have taken place in the world, from the progre&s;s of purified reli|gion, the inflexible &s;pirit of the tender &s;ex is no longer expo&s;ed to &s;uch inhuman trials; but if the earth is happily delivered from the demons of torture and &s;uper|&s;tition; if beauty and innocence are no
<PB N="164" REF="180">
more in danger of being dragged to peri&s;h at the &s;take, I fear there are &s;ituations in female life, that require as much patience and magnanimity as were formerly exerted in the fiery torments of the virgin martyr. It has been ju&s;tly remarked, by tho&s;e who have &s;tudied human nature, that it is more difficult to &s;upport an accumulation of mi|nute infelicities, than any &s;ingle calamity of the mo&s;t terrific magnitude. If this maxim is true, as I believe it to be, it will ju&s;tify me in a&s;&s;erting, that the indigent, unfortunate Old Maid of the pre&s;ent time, is a being as fully entitled to pity, as tho&s;e female victims formerly were, who, in the ages of per&s;ecution, were led to tortures and death. If my reader is &s;tartled, or tempted to &s;mile, at a compari&s;on of two &s;ufferers, who&s;e de&s;tiny may be thought &s;o di&s;&s;imilar, I entreat him to con&s;ider atten|tively the frame of mind, which we may rea&s;onably attribute to the&s;e different ob|jects of compa&s;&s;ion. During the torments of the virgin martyr, the fervour of enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
<PB N="165" REF="181">
and a pa&s;&s;ion for religious glory, are &s;ufficient to give new vigour to the &s;oul, in proportion as the mo&s;t excruciating out|rages are inflicted on the body; but what animating ideas can ari&s;e, to &s;u&s;tain the re|&s;olution of the more unhappy Old Maid, reduced from a &s;tate of affluence and plea|&s;ure to poverty and contempt? reduced to a condition oppo&s;ite to her wi&s;hes, un|friendly to her talents, and de&s;tructive to the health both of her body and her mind? To &s;upport &s;uch a condition with a placid and chearful magnanimity, appears to me one of the highe&s;t exertions of human for|titude; and I have, therefore, always re|garded my poor friend Con&s;tantia as a cha|racter of as much genuine heroi&s;m and piety, as the celebrated St. Agnes, or any other the mo&s;t heroic female &s;aint in the ample calendar of Rome.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantia was the daughter of a mer|chant, who, being left a widower at an early period of life, with two beautiful little girls, be&s;towed upon them a very fa&s;hionable and
<PB N="166" REF="182">
expen&s;ive education. It happened that, when Con&s;tantia had ju&s;t attained the age of twenty-one, her &s;i&s;ter, who was a year older, received, and delighted in, the ad|dre&s;&s;es of a man, con&s;idered as her equal in rank and fortune; a man who was not, in|deed, devoid of affection to his mi&s;tre&s;s, yet di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;uperior attention to her dower. This prudent lover informed the old gentleman, that he was a warm ad|mirer of his elde&s;t daughter, and that he was al&s;o happy in having gained the young lady's good opinion; but that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to marry, unle&s;s he re|ceived, at the time of his marriage, a parti|cular &s;um, which he &s;pecified. The wor|thy merchant was di&s;concerted by this de|claration, as he had amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of a promi&s;ing match for his child. He replied, however, with calmne&s;s and integrity; he paid &s;ome general com|pliments to his gue&s;t; he &s;aid, he &s;hould be happy to &s;ettle a very good girl with a man of character, whom &s;he &s;eemed to ap|prove;
<PB N="167" REF="183">
but he was under a painful nece&s;|&s;ity of rejecting the propo&s;al, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to comply with the terms required, without a material injury to his younge&s;t daughter. The cautious &s;uitor took a formal leave, and departed. The hone&s;t father, in a private conference, with his elde&s;t child, gave her a full and ingenuous account of his conduct. She applauded the ju&s;tice of his deci&s;ion, but felt her own lo&s;s &s;o &s;everely, that the hou&s;e &s;oon became a &s;cene of general di&s;tre&s;s. Con&s;tantia, finding her &s;i&s;ter in tears, would not leave her without knowing the cau&s;e of her affliction. As &s;oon as &s;he had di&s;co|vered it, &s;he flew to her father; &s;he thanked him for his parental attention to her inte|re&s;t, but, with the mo&s;t eager and generous entreaties, conjured him not to let a mi&s;|taken kindne&s;s to her prove the &s;ource of their general unhappine&s;s. She declared, with all the liberal ardour and &s;incerity of a young affectionate mind, that &s;he valued fortune only as it might enable her to pro|mote
<PB N="168" REF="184">
the comfort of tho&s;e &s;he loved; and that, whatever her own future de&s;tiny might be, the delight of having &s;ecured the felicity of her &s;i&s;ter, would be infinitely more valuable to her than any portion whatever. She enlarged on the delicacy of her &s;i&s;ter's health, and the danger of thwarting her pre&s;ent &s;ettled affection. In &s;hort, &s;he pleaded for the &s;u&s;pended mar|riage with &s;uch genuine and pathetic elo|quence, that her father embraced her with tears of delight and admiration; but the more he admired her genero&s;ity, the more he thought him&s;elf obliged to refu&s;e her reque&s;t. He abhorred the idea of making &s;uch a noble-minded girl, what &s;he was de&s;irous, indeed, of making her&s;elf, an ab|&s;olute &s;acrifice to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her &s;i&s;ter; and he flattered him&s;elf, that the affection of his elde&s;t girl, which the kind zeal of Con&s;tantia had repre&s;ented to him in &s;o &s;erious a light, would be ea&s;ily obliterated by time and reflection. In this hope, how|ever, he was greatly deceived: the poor
<PB N="169" REF="185">
girl, indeed, attempted, at fir&s;t, to di&s;play a re&s;olution, which &s;he was unable to &s;up|port; her heart was di&s;appointed, and her health began to &s;uffer. Con&s;tantia was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at the idea of proving the death of a &s;i&s;ter whom &s;he tenderly loved, and &s;he renewed her adjurations to her father with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible importunity, that, touched with the peculiar &s;ituation of his two amia|ble children, and elated with &s;ome new pro&s;pects of commercial emolument, he re|&s;olved, at la&s;t, to comply with the generous entreaty of Con&s;tantia, though at &s;ome little hazard of leaving her expo&s;ed to indigence.</P>
<P>The prudent lover was recalled; his re|turn &s;oon re&s;tored the declining health of his mi&s;tre&s;s; all difficulties were adju&s;ted by a pecuniary compliance with his de|mands; the day of marriage was fixed; and Con&s;tantia, after &s;acrificing every &s;hilling of her &s;ettled portion, attended her &s;i&s;ter to church, with a heart more filled with exul|tation and delight, than that of the bride her&s;elf, who had ri&s;en from a &s;tate of de|jection
<PB N="170" REF="186">
and de&s;pair to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man &s;he loved. But the plea&s;ure that the generous Con&s;tantia derived from an event which &s;he had &s;o nobly promoted, was very &s;oon converted into concern and anxiety. In a vi&s;it of &s;ome weeks, to the hou&s;e of the new-married couple, &s;he &s;oon di&s;co|vered that her brother-in-law, though entitled to the character of an hone&s;t and well-meaning man, was very far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the rare and invaluable ta|lent of conferring happine&s;s on the objects of his regard. Though he had appeared, on their fir&s;t acquaintance, a man of a cul|tivated under&s;tanding, and an elegant ad|dre&s;s, yet, under his own roof, he indulged him&s;elf in a peevi&s;h irritability of temper, and a pa&s;&s;ion for dome&s;tic argument, pecu|liarly painful to the quick feelings of Con|&s;tantia, who, from the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of her frame, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon deli|cacy both of mind and manners. She ob|&s;erved, however, with great &s;atisfaction, and with no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e, that her &s;i&s;ter was
<PB N="171" REF="187">
not equally hurt by this fretful infirmity of her hu&s;band. Happily for her own com|fort, that lady was one of tho&s;e good, loving women, who&s;e &s;oft yet &s;teady affection, like a drop of melted wax, has the property of &s;ticking to any &s;ub&s;tance on which it acci|dentally falls. She often adopted, it is true, the quick and querulous &s;tyle of her hu&s;band; nay, their dome&s;tic debates have run &s;o high, that poor Con&s;tantia has &s;ome|times dreaded, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t wi&s;hed, an ab&s;olute &s;eparation; but her lively ter|rors on this &s;ubject were gradually dimi|ni&s;hed by ob&s;erving, that although they frequently &s;kirmi&s;hed, after &s;upper, in a very angry tone, yet, at the breakfa&s;t-table the next morning, they &s;eldom failed to re|&s;ume a becoming tenderne&s;s of language. The&s;e &s;udden and frequent tran&s;itions from war to peace, and from peace to war, may po&s;&s;ibly be very entertaining to the belli|gerent parties them&s;elves; but I believe they always hurt a benevolent &s;pectator. Con&s;tantia &s;hortened her vi&s;it. She departed,
<PB N="172" REF="188">
indeed, di&s;appointed and chagrined; but &s;he generou&s;ly concealed her &s;en&s;ations, and cheri&s;hed a plea&s;ing hope, that &s;he might hereafter return to the hou&s;e with more &s;atisfaction, either from an improve|ment in the temper of its ma&s;ter, or, at lea&s;t, from opportunities of amu&s;ing her&s;elf with the expected children of her &s;i&s;ter; but, alas! in this her &s;econd hope, the warm-hearted Con&s;tantia was more cruelly di&s;ap|pointed. Her &s;i&s;ter was, in due time, de|livered of a child; but it proved a very &s;ickly infant, and &s;oon expired. The af|flicted mother langui&s;hed for a con&s;iderable time, in a very infirm &s;tate of health, and, after frequent mi&s;carriages, &s;unk her&s;elf into the grave. The widower, having pa&s;&s;ed the cu&s;tomary period in all the de|cencies of mourning, took the earlie&s;t op|portunity of con&s;oling him&s;elf for his lo&s;s, by the acqui&s;ition of a more opulent bride; and, as men of his prudent di&s;po&s;ition have but little &s;atisfaction in the &s;ight of a per|&s;on from whom they have received great
<PB N="173" REF="189">
obligations, which they do not mean to repay, he thought it proper to drop all in|tercour&s;e with Con&s;tantia. She had a &s;pirit too noble to be mortified by &s;uch neglect. Indeed, as &s;he believed, in the fondne&s;s of her recent affliction, that her &s;i&s;ter might have &s;till been living, had &s;he been happily united to a man of a more amiable temper, &s;he rejoiced that his ungrateful conduct re|lieved her from a painful nece&s;&s;ity of prac|ti&s;ing hypocritical civilities towards a rela|tion, whom in her heart &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed. By the death of her &s;i&s;ter &s;he was very deeply afflicted, and this affliction was &s;oon fol|lowed by &s;uperior calamities.</P>
<P>The affairs of her father began to a&s;&s;ume a very alarming appearance. His health and &s;pirits de&s;erted him on the approaching wreck of his fortune. Terrified with the pro&s;pect of bankruptcy, and wounded to the &s;oul by the idea of the de&s;titute condi|tion, in which he might leave his only &s;ur|viving child, he reproached him&s;elf ince&s;|&s;antly for the want of parental ju&s;tice, in
<PB N="174" REF="190">
having complied with the entreaties of the too generous Con&s;tantia. That incomparable young woman, by the mo&s;t &s;ignal union of tenderne&s;s and fortitude, endeavoured to alleviate all the &s;ufferings of her father. To give a more chearful ca&s;t to his mind, &s;he exerted all the vigour and all the viva|city of her own; &s;he regulated all his do|me&s;tic expences with an a&s;&s;iduous but a tranquil oeconomy, and di&s;covered a pecu|liar plea&s;ure in denying to her&s;elf many u&s;ual expen&s;ive articles, both of dre&s;s and diver&s;ion. The hone&s;t pride and delight which he took in the contemplation of her endearing character, enabled the good old man to triumph, for &s;ome time, over &s;ick|ne&s;s, terror, and misfortune. By the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Con&s;tantia, he &s;truggled through &s;e|veral years of commercial perplexity; at la&s;t, however, the fatal hour arrived, which he had &s;o grievou&s;ly apprehended; he became a bankrupt, and re&s;olved to retire into France, with a faint hope of repairing his ruined fortune, by the aid of connections
<PB N="175" REF="191">
which he had formed in that country. He could not &s;upport the thought of carrying Con&s;tantia among foreigners, in &s;o indigent a condition, and he therefore determined to leave her under the protection of her aunt, Mrs. Braggard, a widow lady, who, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a comfortable jointure, and a no|table &s;pirit of oeconomy, was enabled to make a very con&s;iderable figure in a coun|try town. Mrs. Braggard was one of tho&s;e good women, who, by paying the mo&s;t punctual vi&s;its to a cathedral, imagine they acquire an unque&s;tionable right, not only to &s;peak aloud their own exemplary virtues, but to make as free as they plea&s;e with the conduct and character of every per&s;on, both within and without the circle of their ac|quaintance. Having enjoyed from her youth a very hale con&s;titution, and not having injured it by any fooli&s;h tender ex|ce&s;&s;es, either of love or &s;orrow, &s;he was, at the age of fifty-four, completely equal to all the bu&s;ine&s;s and bu&s;tle of the female world. As &s;he wi&s;ely believed activity to
<PB N="176" REF="192">
be a great &s;ource both of health and amu&s;e|ment, &s;he was always extremely active in her own affairs, and &s;ometimes in tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>She con&s;idered the key of her &s;tore-room as her &s;ceptre of dominion, and, not wi&s;h|ing to delegate her authority to any mini&s;ter whatever, &s;he was very far from wanting the &s;ociety of her niece, as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the management of her hou&s;e; yet &s;he was very ready to receive the unfortunate Con|&s;tantia under her roof, for the &s;ake of the plea&s;ure which would certainly ari&s;e to her, not indeed from the uncommon charms of Con&s;tantia's conver&s;ation, but from repeating her&s;elf, to every creature who vi&s;ited at her hou&s;e, <HI>what a great friend &s;he was to that poor girl.</HI></P>
<P>Painful as &s;uch repetitions mu&s;t be to a mind of quick &s;en&s;ibility, Con&s;tantia &s;up|ported them with a mode&s;t re&s;ignation. There were circum&s;tances in her pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation that galled her much more. Mrs. Braggard had an utter contempt, or rather a
<PB N="177" REF="193">
con&s;titutional antipathy, for literature and mu&s;ic, the darling amu&s;ements of Con&s;tantia, and indeed the only occupations by which &s;he hoped to &s;ooth her agitated &s;pirits, un|der the pre&s;&s;ure of her various afflictions. Her father, with a very tender &s;olicitude, had &s;ecured to her a favourite harp&s;ichord, and a &s;mall but choice collection of books. The&s;e, however, in&s;tead of proving the &s;ources of con&s;olatory amu&s;ement, as he had kindly imagined, only &s;erved to increa&s;e the vexations of the poor Con&s;tantia, as &s;he &s;eldom attempted either to &s;ing or to read, without hearing a prolix invective from her aunt, again&s;t mu&s;ical and learned ladies.</P>
<P>Mrs. Braggard &s;eemed to think, that all u&s;eful knowledge, and all rational delight, are centered in a &s;ocial game of cards; and Con&s;tantia, who, from principles of grati|tude and good-nature, wi&s;hed to accommo|date her&s;elf to the humour of every per&s;on from whom &s;he received obligation, a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly endeavoured to promote the diver|&s;ion of her aunt; but having little or no
<PB N="178" REF="194">
plea&s;ure in cards, and being &s;ometimes un|able, from unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, to command her attention, &s;he was generally a lo&s;er; a circum&s;tance which produced a very bitter oration from the attentive old lady, who declared that inattention of this kind was inexcu&s;able in a girl, when the money &s;he played for was &s;upplied by a friend. At the keenne&s;s, or rather the brutality, of this reproach, the poor in&s;ulted Con&s;tantia bur&s;t into tears, and a painful dialogue en&s;ued, in which &s;he felt all the wretchedne&s;s of depending on the o&s;tentatious charity of a relation, who&s;e heart and &s;oul had not the lea&s;t affinity with her own. The conver&s;a|tion ended in a compromi&s;e, by which Con|&s;tantia obtained the permi&s;&s;ion of renoun|cing cards for ever, on the condition, which &s;he her&s;elf propo&s;ed, of never touching her harp&s;ichord again, as the &s;ound of that in|&s;trument was as unplea&s;ant to Mrs. Brag|gard, as the &s;ight of a card-table was to her unfortunate niece.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantia pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable time in this
<PB N="179" REF="195">
&s;tate of unmerited mortification, wretched in her own &s;ituation, and anxious, to the mo&s;t painful degree, concerning the fate of her father. Perceiving there were no hopes of his return to England, &s;he wrote him a mo&s;t tender and pathetic letter, enumerat|ing all her afflictions, and imploring his con&s;ent to her taking leave of her aunt, and endeavouring to acquire a more peaceable maintenance for her&s;elf, by teaching the rudiments of mu&s;ic to young ladies; an employment to which her talents were per|fectly equal. To this filial petition &s;he received a very extraordinary, and a very painful an&s;wer, which accident led me to peru&s;e, a few years after the death of the unhappy father who wrote it.</P>
<P>It happened, that a friend reque&s;ted me to point out &s;ome accompli&s;hed woman, in humble circum&s;tances, and about the mid|dle &s;ea&s;on of life, who might be willing to live as a companion with a lady of great fortune and excellent character, who had the misfortune to lo&s;e the u&s;e of her eyes.
<PB N="180" REF="196">
Upon this application, I immediately thought of Con&s;tantia. My acquaintance with her had commenced before the mar|riage of her &s;i&s;ter, and the uncommon &s;pirit of genero&s;ity, which &s;he exerted on that oc|ca&s;ion, made me very ambitious of cultivat|ing a la&s;ting friend&s;hip with &s;o noble a mind; but living at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, our intimacy had for &s;everal years been &s;upported only by a regular corre&s;pondence. At the time of my friend's application, Con&s;tantia's letters had informed me that her father was dead, and that &s;he had no pro&s;pect of e&s;caping from a mode of life which I knew was utterly incompatible with her ea&s;e and comfort. I ;oncluded, therefore, that I &s;hould find her mo&s;t ready to embrace the propo&s;al which I had to communicate, and I re&s;lved to pay her a vi&s;it in per&s;on, for the plea&s;ure of being my&s;elf the bearer of &s;uch welcome intelli|gence. Many years had elap&s;ed &s;ince we met, and they were years that were not cal|culated to improve either the per&s;on or
<PB N="181" REF="197">
the manners of my unfortunate friend. To &s;ay truth, I perceived a very &s;triking alte|ration in both. It would be impo&s;&s;ible, I believe, for the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of wo|men to exi&s;t in &s;uch &s;ociety, as that to which Con&s;tantia had been condemned, with|out lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable portion of her ex|ternal graces. My friend appeared to me like a fine &s;tatue, that had been long ex|po&s;ed to all the injuries of bad weather; the beautiful poli&s;h was gone, but that &s;u|perior excellence remained, which could not be affected by the influence of the &s;ky. I was, indeed, at fir&s;t, greatly &s;truck by a new and unexpected coar&s;ene&s;s in her lan|guage and addre&s;s; but I &s;oon perceived, that although her manners had &s;uffered, &s;he &s;till retained all the &s;pirited tenderne&s;s, and all the elegance of her mind. She magnified the unlooked-for obligation of my vi&s;it, with that cordial exce&s;s of gra|titude, with which the amiable unhappy are inclined to con&s;ider the petty kindne&s;&s;es of a friend. I wi&s;hed, indeed, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her,
<PB N="182" REF="198">
and believed that chance had enabled me to do &s;o; but there were ob&s;tacles to prevent it, of which I had no apprehen&s;ion. The fir&s;t reply that Con&s;tantia made to my propo&s;al, for her new &s;ettlement in life, was a &s;ilent but expre&s;&s;ive &s;hower of tears. To the&s;e, however, I gave a wrong interpretation; for, knowing all the mi&s;ery of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I imagined they were tears of joy, drawn from her by the &s;udden pro&s;pect of an unexpected e&s;cape from a &s;tate of the mo&s;t mortifying dependence. She &s;oon undeceived me, and, putting into my hand two letters, which &s;he had taken from a little pocket-book, "Here," &s;he &s;aid, <Q>is the &s;ource of my tears, and the rea&s;on why nothing remains for me, but to ble&s;s you for your kind intention, without re|ceiving any advantage from your de&s;ign of befriending &s;o unfortunate a wretch.</Q> Con&s;tantia continued to weep; and I eagerly &s;earched into this my&s;terious &s;ource of her di&s;tre&s;s. I found the fir&s;t letter in my hand contained her petition to her father, which
<PB N="183" REF="199">
I have mentioned already; the &s;econd was his reply to her reque&s;t, a reply which it was impo&s;&s;ible to read, without &s;haring the &s;ufferings both of the parent and the child. This unhappy father, ruined both in his fortune and his health, had been for &s;ome time tormented by an imaginary terror, the mo&s;t painful that can po&s;&s;ibly enter into a parental bo&s;om; he had conceived that, in con&s;equence of his having &s;acrificed the in|tere&s;t of his younger daughter to the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of her &s;i&s;ter, the de&s;titute Con&s;tantia would be at length reduced to a &s;tate of ab|&s;olute indigence and pro&s;titution. Under the pre&s;&s;ure of this idea, which amounted almo&s;t to frenzy, he had replied to her re|que&s;t. His letter was wild, incoherent, and long; but the purport of it was, that if &s;he ever quitted her pre&s;ent re&s;idence, while &s;he her&s;elf was unmarried, and her aunt alive, &s;he would expo&s;e her&s;elf to the cur&s;e of an offended father; and his male|diction was indeed, in this ca&s;e, denounced again&s;t her in terms the mo&s;t vehement
<PB N="184" REF="200">
that the language of contending pa&s;&s;ions could po&s;&s;ibly &s;upply. Having rapidly peru&s;ed this letter, I endeavoured to con|&s;ole my poor weeping friend, by repre&s;ent|ing it as the wild effu&s;ion of a very worthy but mi&s;guided man, who&s;e unde&s;erved cala|mities had impaired his rea&s;on. <Q>My fa|ther,</Q> replied Con&s;tantia, <Q>is now at re&s;t in his grave, and you, perhaps, may think it &s;uper&s;titious in me to pay &s;o much re|gard to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing letter; but he never in his life laid any command upon me, which was not &s;ugge&s;ted by his af|fection, and, wretched as I am, I cannot be di&s;obedient even to his a&s;hes.</Q> Con|&s;tantia, though &s;he &s;hed many tears as &s;he &s;poke, yet &s;poke in the tone of a determined martyr. I repeated every argument that rea|&s;on and friend&s;hip could &s;ugge&s;t, to &s;hake a re&s;olution &s;o pernicious to her&s;elf; but I could make no impre&s;&s;ion on her mind: &s;he had determined to adhere &s;trictly to the letter, as well as the &s;pirit, of her father's interdiction; and, as I perceived that &s;he
<PB N="185" REF="201">
had an hone&s;t pride in her filial piety, I could no longer think of oppo&s;ing it. In|&s;tead, therefore, of recommending to her a new &s;y&s;tem of life, I endeavoured to recon|cile her mind to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation. "Perhaps," replied Con&s;tantia, <Q>no female orphan, who has been pre&s;erved by pro|vidence from ab&s;olute want, from in|famy and guilt, ought to repine at her condition; and, when I con&s;ider the more deplorable wretchedne&s;s of &s;ome unhappy beings of my own &s;ex, who&s;e mi&s;ery, perhaps, has ari&s;en more from accident than from voluntary error, I am inclined to reproach my own heart for tho&s;e murmurs, which &s;ometimes, I confe&s;s to you, e&s;cape from it in &s;oli|tude; yet, if I were to give you a ge|nuine account of all that I endure, you, I know, would kindly a&s;&s;ure me, that the di&s;content, which I &s;trive in vain to &s;ubdue, has not amounted to a crime.</Q> She then entered into a detail of many do|me&s;tic &s;cenes, and gave me &s;o &s;trong a pic|ture
<PB N="186" REF="202">
of a life de&s;titute of all &s;ocial comfort, and harra&s;&s;ed by &s;uch an infinitude of di&s;|piriting vexations, that I expre&s;&s;ed a very &s;incere admiration of the meek and mode&s;t fortitude which &s;he had di&s;played in &s;up|porting it &s;o long. <Q>I have, indeed, &s;uf|fered a great deal,</Q> &s;aid Con&s;tantia, with a deep &s;igh; <Q>but the wor&s;t is not over; I am afraid that I &s;hall lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of hu|manity: I can take no intere&s;t in any thing; and, to confe&s;s a very painful truth to you, I do not feel, as I ought to do, the unde&s;erved attention and friend&s;hip which I am at this moment re|ceiving from you.</Q> I would have tried to rally her out of the&s;e gloomy phanta&s;ies; but &s;he interrupted me, by exclaiming, with a &s;tern yet low voice, <Q>Indeed it is true; and I can only explain my &s;en&s;ations to you, by &s;aying, that I feel as if my heart was turning into &s;tone.</Q> This forcible expre&s;&s;ion, and the corre&s;ponding ca&s;t of countenance with which &s;he uttered it, rendered me, for &s;ome moments, unable to
<PB N="187" REF="203">
reply; it &s;truck me, indeed, as a lament|able truth, to which different parts of her much-altered frame bore a &s;trong though &s;ilent te&s;timony. In her face, which was once remarkable for a fine complexion, and the mo&s;t animated look of intelligent good-nature, there now appeared a &s;allow palene&s;s, and, though not a &s;our, yet a &s;ettled dejection; her hands al&s;o had the &s;ame bloodle&s;s appearance, retaining neither the warmth nor the colour of living fle&s;h;&mdash;yet Con&s;tantia was at this time perfectly free from every nominal di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The entrance of Mrs. Braggard gave a new turn to our conver&s;ation, but without affording us relief. That good lady en|deavoured to entertain me with particular attention; but there was &s;uch a &s;trange mixture of vulgar dignity and indelicate facetiou&s;ne&s;s in her di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he was very far from &s;ucceeding in her de&s;ign. She a&s;ked me, if I was not greatly &s;truck by the change that a few years had made in the countenance of her niece, hinting, in
<PB N="188" REF="204">
very coar&s;e terms of awkward jocularity, that the lo&s;s of her complexion was to be imputed to her &s;ingle life; and adding, with an affected air of kindne&s;s, that, as &s;he had &s;ome very rich relations in Jamaica, &s;he believed &s;he &s;hould be tempted to carry the poor girl to the We&s;t Indies, to try all the chances of new acquaintance in a warmer climate. I perceived the pale cheek of Con|&s;tantia begin to redden at this language of her aunt. As the expre&s;&s;ions of that good lady grew more and more painful to her ingenuous pride, the unfortunate Con&s;tantia, who found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppre&s;s her tears, now quitted the room; but &s;he re|turned to us again in a few minutes, with an air of compo&s;ed &s;orrow, and of meek endurance.</P>
<P>I &s;oon ended my mortifying vi&s;it, and left the town in which Con&s;tantia re&s;ided, with a di&s;po&s;ition to quarrel with fortune for her inju&s;tice and cruelty to my amiable friend. It &s;eemed to me as if nature had de&s;igned, that an affectionate activity, and a joyous
<PB N="189" REF="205">
benevolence, &s;hould be the vital &s;prings in Con&s;tantia's exi&s;tence; but that chance having thrown her into a &s;ituation, which afforded no nouri&s;hment to the lovely qua|lities of her heart and mind, &s;he was peri&s;h|ing like a flower in an unfriendly &s;oil.</P>
<P>My imagination was wounded by the image of her de&s;tiny; but the generous Con&s;tantia, &s;eeing the impre&s;&s;ion which her &s;ufferings had made upon me, wrote me a letter of con&s;olation. She arraigned her&s;elf, with an amiable degree of inju&s;tice, for having painted to me, in colours much too &s;trong, the unplea&s;ant qualities of her aunt, and the di&s;quietude of her own condition: &s;he flattered me with the idea, that my vi&s;it and advice to her had given a more chearful ca&s;t to her mind; and &s;he encou|raged me to hope, that time would make her a perfect philo&s;opher. In the cour&s;e of a few years, I received &s;everal letters from my friend, and all in this comfortable &s;train. At length &s;he &s;ent me the follow|ing billet:

<P>In peru&s;ing this note, I concluded that Mrs. Braggard was going to execute the project &s;he had mentioned, and was really preparing to carry her niece to Jamaica; yet, on reflection, if that were the ca&s;e, Con|&s;tantia might, I thought, have contrived to &s;ee me with more convenience in her pa&s;&s;age through London. However, I obeyed her &s;ummons as expeditiou&s;ly as I could. In a

few minutes after my arrival in the town where &s;he re&s;ided, I was informed, by the landlord of the inn at which I &s;topped, that the life of my poor friend was &s;up|po&s;ed to be in danger. This information at once explained to me the my&s;tery of her. billet. I ha&s;tened to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Braggard, and, in the mid&s;t of my concern and anxiety for my &s;uffering friend, I felt &s;ome comfort on finding, that in our inter|view we &s;hould not be tormented by the pre&s;ence of her unfeeling aunt, as that lady had been tempted to leave her declining charge, to attend the wedding of a more fortunate relation, and was &s;till detained, by &s;cenes of nuptial fe&s;tivity, in a di&s;tant county. When I entered the apartment of Con&s;tantia, I perceived in her eyes a ray of joyous animation, though her frame was &s;o emaciated, and &s;he laboured under &s;uch a general debility, that &s;he was unable to &s;tand a moment without a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her attendant, &s;he &s;eemed to collect all the little portion of
<PB N="192" REF="208">
&s;trength that remained in her decaying frame, to addre&s;s me in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>Be not concerned, my dear friend, at an event, which, though you might not, perhaps, expect it &s;o &s;oon, your friend|&s;hip will, I hope, on reflection, con&s;ider with a &s;incere, though melancholy &s;ati&s;|faction. You have often been &s;o good as to li&s;ten to my complaints; forgive me, therefore, for calling you to be a witne&s;s to that calm and devout com|fort, with which I now look on the ap|proaching end of all my unhappine&s;s! You have heard me &s;ay, that I thought there was a peculiar cruelty in the lot that Heaven had a&s;&s;igned to me; but I now feel, that I too ha&s;tily arraigned the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence. Had I been &s;urrounded with the delights of a happy dome&s;tic life, I could not, I be|lieve, have beheld the near approaches of death in that clear and con&s;olatory light in which they now appear to me. My
<PB N="193" REF="209">
pa&s;t murmurs are, I tru&s;t, forgiven, and I now pay the mo&s;t willing obedience to the decrees of the Almighty. The country, to which I am departing, is, I hope and believe, the country where I &s;hall be again united to the lo&s;t objects of my tendere&s;t affection. I have but little bu&s;ine&s;s to adju&s;t on earth&mdash;may I in|treat the favour of you,</Q> continued Con|&s;tantia, with &s;ome he&s;itation, <Q>to be my ex|ecutor? &mdash;My property,</Q> added &s;he, with a tender yet gha&s;tly &s;mile, <Q>being all con|tained in this narrow chamber, will not give you much embarra&s;&s;ment; and I &s;hall die with peculiar peace of mind, if you will kindly a&s;&s;ure me, I &s;hall be bu|ried by the &s;ide of my dear, unhappy father.</Q> The tender thoughts that over|whelmed her, in mentioning her unfortu|nate parent, now rendered her utterance al|mo&s;t indi&s;tinct; yet &s;he endeavoured to enter on &s;ome private family rea&s;ons for applying to me on this &s;ubject. I thought it mo&s;t kind to interrupt her, by a general
<PB N="194" REF="210">
a&s;&s;urance of my con&s;tant de&s;ire to obey, at all times, every injunction of her's; and, ob&s;erving to her, that her di&s;temper ap|peared to be nothing but mere weakne&s;s of body, I expre&s;&s;ed a hope of &s;eeing her re|&s;tored. But, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon me, &s;he &s;aid, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments, <Q>Be not &s;o unkind as to wi&s;h me to reco|ver; for, 'in the world, I only fill up a place which may be better &s;upplied when I have made it empty.'</Q> The calm and pathetic voice, with which &s;he pronounced the&s;e affecting words of Shake|&s;peare, pierced me to the &s;oul; I was una|ble to reply, and I felt an involuntary tear on my cheek. My poor friend perceived it, and immediately exclaimed, in a more affectionate tone, <Q>You are a good, but weak mortal; I mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s you from a &s;cene, which I hoped you would have &s;upported with more philo&s;ophy. In|deed, I begin al&s;o to feel, that it is too much for us both; if I find my&s;elf a little &s;tronger to-morrow, I will &s;ee you

again; but if I refu&s;e you admittance to my chamber, you mu&s;t not be offended: and now you mu&s;t leave me; do not attempt to &s;ay adieu, but give me your hand, and God ble&s;s you!</Q> Pre&s;&s;ing her cold emaciated fingers to my lips, I left her apartment, as &s;he ordered me, in &s;ilent ha&s;te, apprehending, from the changes in her countenance, that &s;he was in danger of fainting. The next morning &s;he &s;ent me a &s;hort billet, in a trembling hand, begging me to excu&s;e her not &s;eeing me again, as it aro&s;e from motives of kindne&s;s&mdash; and in the evening &s;he expired. Such was the end of this excellent, unfortunate being, in the forty-&s;econd year of her age. The calamities of her life, in&s;tead of giving any a&s;perity to her temper, had &s;oftened and refined it.&mdash;Farewel!&mdash;Thou gentle and benevolent &s;pirit, if, in thy pre&s;ent &s;cene of happier exi&s;tence, thou art con&s;cious of &s;ublunary occurrences, di&s;dain not this im|perfect memorial of thy &s;ufferings and thy virtues! and, if the pages I am now writ|ing,

<HEAD>CHAP. III. On the Charity of Old Maids.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN nature has be&s;towed on the ancient virgin a con&s;titutional fund of benevolence, and fortune has ble&s;&s;ed her with wealth, her condition is highly fa|vourable to the exerci&s;e of beneficent vir|tue. As &s;he is not encumbered with that load of hou&s;hold care, and parental &s;olici|tude, which is apt to cramp the munifi|cence of the married dame, and to confine it within the circle of a &s;ingle family, her kindne&s;s and liberality will be often found to indulge them&s;elves in a more ample field. If, among the many virtues that dignify human nature, there is any one that may claim pre-eminence in the &s;ight of earth and heaven, I apprehend it mu&s;t be charity;&mdash;and of charity, in the mo&s;t en|larged and apo&s;tolical &s;en&s;e of it, I had
<PB N="198" REF="214">
once the happine&s;s of knowing a &s;ingular and perfect image, in the per&s;on of a mo&s;t amiable Old Maid. To a faithful de&s;crip|tion of this lady, under the name of Cha|rie&s;&s;a, I &s;hall devote this chapter, &s;en&s;ible that nothing which my own fancy or un|der&s;tanding might &s;ugge&s;t, on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, could afford to my fair readers a more u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, than they will find in the character of a departed &s;i&s;ter, whom an ea&s;y fortune, and unexampled benevolence, ren|dered, perhaps, the very happie&s;t Old Maid that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Charie&s;&s;a was the younge&s;t child of a worthy and active gentleman, who, though his name had a place in the will of a very opulent father, &s;uffered many hard&s;hips, in the early part of his life, from the &s;cantine&s;s of his patrimony. His father was infected with that ridiculous, or rather dete&s;table, family pride, by which many per&s;ons are tempted to leave their younger children in ab&s;olute indigence, from the vain and ab|&s;urd project of aggrandi&s;ing an elde&s;t &s;on;
<PB N="199" REF="215">
a project which was &s;ugge&s;ted to the old gentleman we are &s;peaking of, by his di&s;|covery of a genealogical table, which un|luckily enabled him to trace his progeni|tors to the reign of Edward the Fourth, when it appeared that one of his ance&s;tors was high &s;heriff for the county in which he re&s;ided.</P>
<P>As the father of Charie&s;&s;a had felt all the evils ari&s;ing from an unju&s;t di&s;tribution of property, he determined to leave whatever fortune he might him&s;elf acquire, in equal proportions among his children. From a very fortunate marriage, and much unex|pected &s;ucce&s;s in life, he was enabled, at his decea&s;e, to leave to his &s;on, and to each of his two daughters, a portion equivalent to &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>The &s;on had been educated in one of the fir&s;t mercantile hou&s;es of London, and, at the time of his father's death, was ju&s;t re|turned from a tour to the continent, where he had been engaged in fixing his future
<PB N="200" REF="216">
corre&s;pondences, before he &s;ettled as a merchant.</P>
<P>He had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome few years in trade, when his uncle, the elde&s;t brother of his father, died without i&s;&s;ue, and left him the family e&s;tate, on the condition of his quit|ting commerce entirely, and re&s;iding at the ancient &s;eat of the Trackums. He obeyed the injunction of the will, and retired into the country with his wife, who, though a celebrated beauty, was a lady of infinite di&s;cretion, and di&s;tingui&s;hed through life by the mo&s;t prudent attention to a numerous family.</P>
<P>'Squire Trackum, as we &s;hall now call him, changed his manners with his place of abode, and quitted the grave addre&s;s of the important merchant, to a&s;&s;ume the boi&s;terous jocularity of the e&s;quires that &s;urrounded him. In a &s;hort time he was &s;o completely metamorpho&s;ed, that in his fir&s;t vi&s;it to town he greatly a&s;toni&s;hed and entertained his old acquaintance of the
<PB N="201" REF="217">
city; but his real character remained the &s;ame. He now concealed, under the ma&s;k of ru&s;tic joviality, that uncommon &s;hare of worldly wi&s;dom, which he formerly hid under the mantle of &s;erious and &s;olemn frankne&s;s; he even carried into the field of rural &s;port, that ince&s;&s;ant attention to inte|re&s;t which he u&s;ed to exert upon Change, and, in the very moment when he was gal|loping after a hare, would calculate the chances of &s;ettling a daughter in marriage, or letting a farm to advantage. In one unguarded moment of real frankne&s;s, when he was warmed by the bottle, he boa&s;ted, to an intimate friend, that he never pa&s;&s;ed ten minutes in the company of any man, with|out con&s;idering how he might derive &s;ome degree of pecuniary or intere&s;ted advantage from his acquaintance.</P>
<P>Before the '&s;quire a&s;&s;umed his rural cha|racter, Erinnis, the elde&s;t of his two &s;i&s;ters, had married a gentleman of a di&s;tant county, who was re&s;pected as the de&s;cen|dant
<PB N="202" REF="218">
of an ancient family, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a large e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The unmarried Charie&s;&s;a, who&s;e temper, &s;uitable to her plea&s;ing, elegant per&s;on, was &s;prightly, generous, and un&s;u&s;pecting, con|ceived a mo&s;t lively attachment to the wife and children of her brother, whom &s;he al|ways regarded with &s;uch affectionate confi|dence, that &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be guided, in all important points, by his judgment and advice.</P>
<P>The provident '&s;quire, con&s;idering that a rich maiden aunt is an admirable prop to the younger branches of a very fruitful hou&s;e, had very early determined within him&s;elf, that his &s;i&s;ter, Charie&s;&s;a, &s;hould pa&s;s her life in &s;ingle ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and he doubted not but he had &s;ufficient addre&s;s to confirm her an Old Maid, by the artful device of perpetually expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t friendly &s;olicitude for her marrying to ad|vantage. He had per&s;uaded her, on his leaving London, to chu&s;e for her re&s;idence
<PB N="203" REF="219">
a provincial town, in the neighbourhood of Trackum-hall, and by thus &s;ecuring her within the reach of his con&s;tant ob&s;ervation, and &s;tudying to increa&s;e the influence which he had already acquired over her frank and affectionate &s;pirit, he took the mo&s;t effectual precautions for accompli&s;h|ing his wi&s;hes. As Charie&s;&s;a was in, that rank of life, in which matrimonial ap|proaches are made rather in a &s;low and ceremonious, than a rapid and ardent, man|ner, the watchful '&s;quire had &s;ufficient time and opportunity to counteract the attempt of every man, whom he found guilty, or whom he &s;u&s;pected, of a de&s;ign on the heart and hand of this devoted ve&s;tal. By in|ducing his innocent &s;i&s;ter to believe, that he mo&s;t heartily wi&s;hed to &s;ee her well mar|ried, and by per&s;uading her, at the &s;ame time, to think highly of his penetration into the real characters of men&mdash;a penetra|tion which it is difficult for &s;ingle ladies to acquire&mdash;he brought the good and credu|lous Charie&s;&s;a to &s;ee all her lovers exactly
<PB N="204" REF="220">
in that unfavourable point of view, in which his own intere&s;t and artifice con|trived to &s;hew them. In con&s;equence of her affectionate reliance on his a&s;&s;iduous coun&s;el, &s;he ab&s;olutely rejected the over|tures of three gentlemen, who were gene|rally e&s;teemed unexceptionable; but the friendly zeal of the vigilant '&s;quire had di&s;covered, that they were all utterly unworthy of &s;o excellent a creature as Charie&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>The mean de&s;igns of &s;elf-intere&s;t are fre|quently puni&s;hed with the heavy tax of &s;o|licitude, concerning the many dangers to which they are commonly expo&s;ed. It happened thus with our prudent and &s;uc|ce&s;sful '&s;quire. He triumphed, indeed, by putting every &s;uitor to flight, while Charie&s;&s;a re&s;ided within the reach of his indefatigable attention; but there were pe|riods, in which he was tormented by the re&s;tle&s;s apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing all the fruits of his ungenerous labour.</P>
<P>Attached as &s;he was to the per&s;on and
<PB N="205" REF="221">
family of her brother, Charie&s;&s;a did not cea&s;e to love or to vi&s;it her &s;i&s;ter Erinnis; and &s;he re&s;olved to pa&s;s the &s;ummer of every third year at the hou&s;e of that lady, who was &s;ettled in a very di&s;tant part of the kingdom. Erinnis was one of tho&s;e extra|ordinary women, whom nature, in a fit of perver&s;ity, now and then produces, appa|rently for no purpo&s;e, but that of proving a burthen to them&s;elves, and a torment to all around them. Erinnis had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, like her &s;i&s;ter, youth and beauty, opulence and under&s;tanding; but &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them only to &s;hew, that, valuable as the&s;e en|dowments are, they are utterly in&s;ufficient to &s;ecure happine&s;s or e&s;teem, without the nobler ble&s;&s;ings of a benevolent heart and a regulated mind. She was early married to Sir Gregory Gourd, a placid and hone&s;t baronet, who, in rather an advanced &s;ea&s;on of life, had united him&s;elf to this young lady, by the advice of his relations, for the two following purpo&s;es: fir&s;t, to pay off an incumbrance on his ancient e&s;tate with a part
<PB N="206" REF="222">
of her ample dower; and &s;econdly, to pro|vide a male heir to that honourable hou&s;e, who&s;e antiquity he contemplated with a complacent and inoffen&s;ive pride. The luckle&s;s knight was doubly di&s;appointed in the&s;e his two favourite projects. As to the fir&s;t, indeed, he paid off a mortgage; but &s;oon found him&s;elf involved, by the profu|&s;ion of his wife, in much heavier debts: as to his &s;econd hope, whether he had entered too far into the vale of years to be gra|tified in &s;uch an expectation, or whether nature, who had certainly given no mater|nal tenderne&s;s to the temper of Erinnis, had therefore wi&s;ely determined, that &s;he &s;hould never be a mother, I will not pretend to decide; but certain it is, that, vehemently as &s;he panted for this event, Erinnis had never any near pro&s;pect of producing a child. This di&s;appointment, from what cau&s;e &s;oever it might proceed, had &s;uch an ince&s;&s;ant tendency to inflame the natural contemptuous malignity of her &s;pirit, that &s;he in&s;ulted the poor &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive old knight
<PB N="207" REF="223">
with every humiliating outrage, which an imperious wife can inflict on a terrified and unre&s;i&s;ting hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The extreme envy with which the fine and flouri&s;hing group of her brother's chil|dren in&s;pired her, tempted the de&s;perate Erinnis to try the delu&s;ive and dangerous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of quacks; who, lured by the pro|digality with which &s;he was willing to pay for what could not be purcha&s;ed, fed her, for a long time, with fre&s;h hopes of produ|cing, by their various no&s;trums, what nature was re&s;olutely determined to withhold.</P>
<P>The&s;e villainous drugs had not only all the mi&s;chievous effect of drams, both on her countenance and temper, but led her into the habit of applying for pre&s;ent relief, in all her unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations of mind and body, to tho&s;e flattering and fal&s;e friends of the perturbed &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Her pa&s;&s;ions, naturally vehement and acrimonious, were thus inflamed into fits of frenzy; but in the moments of her mo&s;t intemperate ab&s;urdity and extravagance, &s;he
<PB N="208" REF="224">
con&s;tantly retained a con&s;iderable portion of hypocritical cunning, and, however in|&s;olent and injurious in her treatment of all her other relations, &s;he for ever expre&s;&s;ed, though in a di&s;gu&s;ting manner, the fonde&s;t affection for her &s;i&s;ter Charie&s;&s;a. This affection was partly real, and partly pre|tended. There was, indeed, &s;o engaging, &s;o pure, &s;o &s;ublime a &s;pirit of indulgent benevolence in the character of Charie&s;&s;a, that it could not fail to in&s;pire even malignity and madne&s;s with &s;ome portion either of love or re&s;pect. But this pa&s;&s;ionate attach|ment of Erinnis to her &s;i&s;ter aro&s;e chiefly from a mercenary motive. Though Cha|rie&s;&s;a was, in general, ble&s;&s;ed with good health and good &s;pirits, &s;he was frequently &s;ubject to certain feveri&s;h attacks, in which her life was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in danger; and Erinnis, who had &s;quandered enormous &s;ums in the public di&s;play of much awk|ward magnificence, and in many private articles of expence, was grown &s;o needy and rapacious, that &s;he looked forward,
<PB N="209" REF="225">
with all the eagerne&s;s of avarice, to the &s;e|veral thou&s;and pounds, which &s;he was &s;ure of gaining, if the good angel Charie&s;&s;a took her flight to heaven. In her mo&s;t &s;tupefying fits of intoxication, and in her mo&s;t furious fallies of ill-humour, &s;he never lo&s;t &s;ight of this expected legacy. Cha|rie&s;&s;a, who&s;e pure and generous mind could hardly have been induced to believe, that &s;uch an idea ever entered into any human brea&s;t, not only never &s;u&s;pected the profu&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of this pretended love, but gave a very &s;ingular and touching proof of the genuine &s;i&s;terly affection and confidence, with which her own heart was in&s;pired. It happened, that &s;he was attacked by a very dangerous fever, at the hou&s;e of Erinnis. After many days confinement to her bed, being alone with her phy&s;ician, &s;he &s;aid to him, in a very calm and unembarra&s;&s;ed manner, <Q>Pray, &s;ir, tell me very frankly, do you think I &s;hall die?</Q> As her di&s;|temper had ju&s;t taken a favourable turn, the doctor very chearfully replied, <Q>No,
<PB N="210" REF="226">
indeed, my good madam.</Q> Upon which &s;he exclaimed, in a very affectionate tone, <Q>I am glad of it, for the &s;ake of my dear &s;i&s;ter!</Q> Nor was this the exclamation of a feeble mind, afraid of death, and di&s;|gui&s;ing that fear under the ma&s;k of affec|tion. Charie&s;&s;a was a genuine Chri&s;tian, who, having weighed both this world and the next in the balance of rea&s;on and of faith, was at all times perfectly prepared for her natural di&s;&s;olution. Her exclamation was the dictate of the mo&s;t generous and di&s;inte|re&s;ted tenderne&s;s: &s;he had &s;een the artful Erinnis counterfeit &s;uch inordinate &s;orrow, during the cour&s;e of her malady, and &s;he &s;o fondly believed the truth of that well-di&s;|&s;embled affliction, that, totally free from every &s;elfi&s;h idea, the innocent Charie&s;&s;a con&s;idered only the joy, with which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her &s;i&s;ter would contemplate her unexpected recovery.</P>
<P>Though her own affectionate and un&s;u&s;|pecting temper made her receive, with an amiable credulity, all the lavi&s;h endear|ments

of Erinnis, Charie&s;&s;a was very far from being blind to the many glaring faults of her turbulent &s;i&s;ter; but &s;he generou&s;ly found an excu&s;e for them, which converted them at once into objects of the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. She per&s;uaded her&s;elf, that the &s;allow and ferocious appearance, in the altered countenance of Erinnis, proceeded entirely from a di&s;ea&s;e in her liver, and that all the furious perver&s;ities of her temper were owing either to the internal pain of this cruel di&s;order, or to the hot medicines which &s;he was tempted to try. Under the influence of this kind idea, &s;he mo&s;t a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly laboured, not only to apologi&s;e for the offen&s;ive irregularities in the conduct and manners of Erinnis, but to counteract, to the utmo&s;t of her power, all the mi&s;|chievous effects of her capricious and vin|dictive ill-humour: &s;he rai&s;ed and com|forted the poor knight, whenever &s;he &s;aw him reduced to a painful &s;tate of humilia|tion, by the frantic in&s;olence of his wife; &s;he con&s;oled and rewarded the innocent

and unfortunate dome&s;tics, whenever &s;he found them &s;tript and di&s;carded by their turbulent and offended mi&s;tre&s;s: in &s;hort, &s;he endeavoured to maintain a degree of order, ju&s;tice, and decency, throughout a numerous hou&s;hold, under the chaotic do|minion of a malevolent intoxicated fury; and whoever has &s;een her in this trying &s;i|tuation, has &s;een a perfect image of charity, <Q>believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things.</Q></P>
<P>Although the peaceable and chearful &s;pirit of Charie&s;&s;a could find but little plea|&s;ure in a hou&s;e like that of Erinnis, a com|pa&s;&s;ionate affection to her &s;i&s;ter made her very exact in the &s;tated &s;ea&s;on of her vi|&s;its: their duration always extended to &s;ix months, and &s;ometimes amounted to &s;even; a circum&s;tance which did not fail to in|crea&s;e the tormenting fears of her di&s;tant brother Trackum, who always contem|plated the return of Charie&s;&s;a into his neigh|bourhood, with that &s;ort of &s;atisfaction, which is felt by the tamer of a bird, on
<PB N="213" REF="229">
&s;eeing it, after fluttering to the limits of an exten&s;ive chamber, return, in an ea&s;y and voluntary manner, to the open door of its cage.</P>
<P>Charie&s;&s;a, however, was very far from feeling any degree of con&s;traint: &s;he de|parted on many of the&s;e di&s;tant vi&s;its, and returned as often to her own man&s;ion, with|out once &s;u&s;pecting the inquietude which her long ab&s;ence never failed to excite. Indeed, the fearful '&s;quire might have &s;aved him&s;elf the pain of many teazing doubts, and many private perplexing enquiries, had he been capable of forming a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the heart and mind of Charie&s;&s;a; but this, indeed, he was not; and, although he knew that the magnificent but lonely habi|tation of Erinnis was as much avoided as the den of a &s;avage, yet he trembled at the idea of the lovers that the unguarded Cha|rie&s;&s;a might meet in that pompous &s;olitude. He was a&s;&s;ured, that a ru&s;tic apothecary, and a more ru&s;tic divine, were the only frequent vi&s;iters at this dreary ca&s;tle; but,
<PB N="214" REF="230">
as he had no confidence in female delicacy or di&s;cretion, and, as he found that the man of phy&s;ic and the man of God were both &s;ingle men, and that each would have many opportunities of being alone with Charie&s;&s;a, he greatly feared that &s;he and her fortune might fall a &s;acrifice to one or the other of the&s;e formidable a&s;&s;ailants. This ground|le&s;s terror, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed by time, increa&s;ed with the increa&s;ing age of Charie&s;&s;a. The '&s;quire was very coar&s;e in his idea of Old Maids; he concluded, that no virgin turned of forty, and left entirely to her own di&s;cretion, could re&s;i&s;t any ma|trimonial offer whatever; and, as his &s;i&s;ter had reached that deci&s;ive period on her la&s;t vi&s;it to Erinnis, his &s;pirits were not a little depre&s;&s;ed by his de&s;pair of her return in that &s;tate of ve&s;tal purity, which he had &s;o zealou&s;ly wi&s;hed her to maintain. At length, however, his apprehen&s;ion was ef|fectually terminated by an event, which, though much more probable than the dreaded marriage of Charie&s;&s;a, was not &s;o
<PB N="215" REF="231">
&s;trongly anticipated by the imagination of the di&s;tant '&s;quire. This event was the death of Erinnis; who, having utterly worn out a good con&s;titution by the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and di&s;graceful intemperance, died, as &s;he had lived, in magnificent mi&s;ery. The tender Charie&s;&s;a paid the la&s;t offices of af|fection to her unworthy &s;i&s;ter, and returned in a calm and pious &s;tate of mind from the abode of joyle&s;s grandeur, who&s;e vanity was now mo&s;t completely &s;hewn, to her own peaceful and comfortable man&s;ion. Her di&s;po&s;ition was &s;till remarkably chear|ful, and &s;he took too kind and too virtuous an intere&s;t in the general happine&s;s of the living, to think affected &s;orrow a proper compliment to the dead. She had too clearly &s;een all the various infelicity of Erinnis, not to con&s;ider her relea&s;e as a ble&s;&s;ed event; and it plea&s;ed Heaven to reward the long and indulgent attention, which &s;he had paid to the bodily and men|tal infirmities of that unhappy relation, with many years of undi&s;turbed tranquil|lity,
<PB N="216" REF="232">
and the pure&s;t &s;ocial enjoyment. I had opportunities to contemplate her inte|re&s;ting character at this &s;ea&s;on of her life, and, as I believe her to have been, for &s;e|veral years, one of the happie&s;t of mortals, I &s;hall enlarge on the particular circum|&s;tances which con&s;tituted that happine&s;s, and minutely examine that invaluable ca&s;t of mind, which enabled her to gain, and to &s;ecure, the rare&s;t and mo&s;t precarious of all human po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Charie&s;&s;a was about forty-two, when &s;he returned to a con&s;tant re&s;idence in her own quiet and comfortable man&s;ion: &s;he was naturally fond of &s;ociety, and her ea&s;y fortune enabled her to enjoy it in that temperate and rational manner, which &s;uited her inclination. Having made many ju&s;t remarks on the different conditions of female life, &s;he was perfectly convinced, that &s;he had great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with her own &s;ingle &s;tate, and no incidents aro&s;e, that could make her wi&s;h to change it. Her patrimonial fortune had been much increa&s;ed by &s;ome con&s;iderable
<PB N="217" REF="233">
legacies, and &s;he enjoyed an income, which, by her prudent regulation of it, not only &s;upplied her with all the u&s;ual comforts of affluence, but furni&s;hed her with the exalted plea&s;ure of conferring happine&s;s on a &s;e|lected number of indu&s;trious poor. She had a &s;pacious and chearful hou&s;e, that pe|culiarly plea&s;ed her own fancy, and a &s;et of intelligent and good-humoured dome&s;tics, who were attached, more by affection than by intere&s;t, to her per&s;on; and the neigh|bouring &s;eat of her brother afforded her a young flouri&s;hing family, whom &s;he fre|quently &s;urveyed with all the tender de|light of an affectionate parent.</P>
<P>Such were the external circum&s;tances that contributed to form the happine&s;s of Charie&s;&s;a; circum&s;tances, indeed, highly de&s;irable in them&s;elves, yet utterly in&s;uffi|cient to make a woman happy, without tho&s;e nobler internal ble&s;&s;ings, which were the true riches of Charie&s;&s;a. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the mo&s;t eminent degree, a chearful &s;im|plicity of heart, inexhau&s;tible benevolence,
<PB N="218" REF="234">
and unaffected piety. It was by the con|&s;tant yet mode&s;t exerci&s;e of the&s;e admirable qualities, that Charie&s;&s;a &s;ecured to her&s;elf, not only more felicity, but even more pub|lic regard and attention, than was obtained by &s;ome &s;ingle ladies of her neighbour|hood, who were undoubtedly her &s;uperiors in the attractive endowments of beauty, opulence, and wit. Charie&s;&s;a, perhaps, was never known in her life to utter a witty repartee; but, &s;uch is the lively influence of genuine good-nature, that her conver&s;a|tion never failed to delight, and her hou&s;e was frequented as the abode of benevolent vivacity. Though &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the gay period of youth, and never affected to di&s;|gui&s;e her age, &s;he took a particular &s;atisfac|tion in promoting the innocent amu&s;ements of the young; indeed, &s;he was a general friend to every &s;ea&s;on and every rank of life: even the common acquaintance of Charie&s;&s;a, if they had any occa&s;ion to wi&s;h for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were &s;ure of finding her,
<PB N="219" REF="235">
without &s;olicitation, a zealous promoter of their pro&s;perity and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>There was a period in her life, at which &s;ome of her uncandid neighbours conjec|tured, that the &s;ubtle vice of avarice was be|ginning to infect her; &s;he &s;uddenly parted with her chariot, and reduced her e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, without a&s;&s;igning her rea&s;ons for conduct &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing. In a few years &s;he re&s;umed her equipage, and recom|menced her u&s;ual &s;tyle of living, with as much or rather more &s;plendor than ever. This &s;till more engaged the attention of the neighbourhood; and the very people, who, on the former alteration, had accu&s;ed her of avarice, now exclaimed, that &s;he was either &s;eized with the frenzy of extrava|gance, or was endeavouring to allure a hu&s;band. It was, however, proclaimed upon her death, by the worthy family of a decea&s;ed merchant, that, under the promi&s;e of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ecrecy, &s;he had al|lotted to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, during the years of the above-mentioned retrenchment, a full
<PB N="220" REF="236">
moiety of her income, by which generous exertion &s;he had &s;upported him through &s;ome mo&s;t cruel and unde&s;erved di&s;tre&s;&s;es, enabled him to retrieve his circum&s;tances, and pre&s;erve his family from impending ruin.</P>
<P>Though her &s;pirits were naturally quick, and her affections very &s;trong, I never heard an in&s;tance of her being at any time betrayed into an uncandid animo&s;ity. The town, in which &s;he re&s;ided, was frequently di&s;tracted by eccle&s;ia&s;tical and parliamentary contention. In tho&s;e uncharitable &s;trug|gles for power, the relations of Charie&s;&s;a were often hotly engaged. Her affectionate heart never failed, indeed, to take a lively intere&s;t in all their pur&s;uits, but &s;he never ridiculed or vilified their opponents, with tho&s;e eager and illiberal invectives, which have been known to flow, upon &s;uch ex|a&s;perating occa&s;ions, from the lips of many a quiet &s;pin&s;ter, and of many a &s;ober ma|tron. The enmity of Charie&s;&s;a was as ge|nerous as her friend&s;hip; and, whenever
<PB N="221" REF="237">
&s;he heard &s;uch petty abu&s;ive tales, as are ba&s;ely fabricated in every popular conte&s;t, for the purpo&s;e of the hour, although they favoured her own party, &s;he would di&s;|countenance their circulation, or expo&s;e their ab&s;urdity. Nor was this liberality of conduct without its reward: Charie&s;&s;a had the &s;atisfaction of perceiving, that &s;he con|ciliated to her&s;elf the perfect re&s;pect and good-will of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite contending characters. Perhaps there never lived a human being, &s;o fairly and fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of general e&s;teem; and, to a mind truly amiable, there can hardly be a &s;tate of earthly enjoyment &s;uperior to what ari&s;es from ince&s;&s;ant and open proofs of being univer&s;ally beloved. Having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, for many years, this tranquil and pure delight, the tender Charie&s;&s;a began to &s;ink under natural infirmity: &s;he &s;u&s;tained a &s;hort but &s;evere illne&s;s with exemplary com|po&s;ure, and, in the clo&s;e of it, with that calm and chearful devotion which had di&s;tingui&s;hed her life, &s;he re&s;igned her bene|volent
<PB N="222" REF="238">
&s;pirit to the great parent of all be|nevolence.</P>
<P>The influence of her virtue was very far from cea&s;ing with her mortal exi&s;tence; and, though twelve years have now elap&s;ed &s;ince the decea&s;e of this admirable woman, her excellent qualities are &s;till fre&s;h in the memory of all who had the happine&s;s of her acquaintance; and they hardly ever pa&s;s the hou&s;e in which &s;he re&s;ided, with|out be&s;towing a &s;igh of regret, or a &s;en|tence of prai&s;e, on the merits of Charie&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>It was, undoubtedly, the warm and ge|nuine &s;pirit of charity, in the &s;criptural comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e of that word, which gave &s;o &s;trong an effect to the &s;imple cha|racter of this excellent per&s;on. Indeed, in the formation of her character, it &s;eemed as if nature had determined to &s;hew how far her own powers were &s;ufficient to make a woman both amiable and happy, without borrowing any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art. To the various elegant accompli&s;hments that par|ticularly belong to her &s;ex and her &s;tation,
<PB N="223" REF="239">
we might almo&s;t &s;ay, that Charie&s;&s;a was an ab&s;olute &s;tranger: &s;he had no ear for mu|&s;ic, no ta&s;te for painting, no talents for any elaborate and graceful works of the needle; &s;he had no pa&s;&s;ion for books, and had there|fore contracted &s;o &s;lender an acquaintance with polite literature, that, in common di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;he adopted many terms of provincial vulgarity: yet, &s;o admirably did chearfulne&s;s and good-nature atone for all her defi|ciencies, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to think her conver&s;ation tire&s;ome, or her company in&s;ipid. I once, indeed, heard it remarked, by an ancient &s;pin&s;ter of her neighbour|hood, who, though infinitely more opulent, was not half &s;o much re&s;pected, that Cha|rie&s;&s;a had a very weak under&s;tanding: but if to avoid all the little jealou&s;ies, &s;u&s;pi|cions, and bickerings of ordinary &s;pirits; if to conciliate univer&s;al regard, without practi&s;ing the ungenerous arts of hypocri&s;y and adulation; if to pur&s;ue and reli&s;h the mo&s;t innocent and rational plea&s;ures with moderation and gratitude, if to di&s;charge
<PB N="224" REF="240">
the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential duties with regularity, devoid of o&s;tentation; if, in &s;hort, to enjoy and to di&s;tribute the valuable, though tran&s;i|tory happine&s;s of this world, and at the &s;ame time to &s;ecure the permanent and in|e&s;timable felicity of that which is an|nounced to us by the promi&s;es of Heaven; if, I &s;ay, to do all this may be con&s;idered as a proof of wi&s;dom, envy her&s;elf mu&s;t allow, that Charie&s;&s;a was one of the wi&s;e&s;t as well as the mo&s;t fortunate of women.</P>
<P>I have dwelt with peculiar plea&s;ure on the character of this amiable per&s;on, not only from the affection which I bear to her memory, but from the wi&s;h of exciting many a worthy Old Maid to emulate that benevolent alacrity which formed the hap|pine&s;s of my departed friend. No example can, I think, be pre&s;ented to the &s;i&s;terhood, which they may follow with greater ea&s;e, or with &s;uperior advantage. It mu&s;t, in|deed, be allowed, that few ancient virgins po&s;&s;e&s;s the comfortable affluence of Cha|rie&s;&s;a; yet her excellence aro&s;e not from
<PB N="225" REF="241">
external circum&s;tances; with a much hum|bler revenue, &s;he would have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and di&s;covered the &s;ame generous felicity of &s;pirit. Nature is equally indulgent to every rank in life; as in her vegetable kingdom &s;he has kindly made the &s;weete&s;t of flowers the mo&s;t common, &s;o, in the moral world, &s;he has placed the lovely vir|tue, which conduces mo&s;t to human happi|ne&s;s, equally within the reach and cultiva|tion of the rich and the poor. Benevolence may be con&s;idered as the ro&s;e, which is found as beautiful and as fragrant in the narrow border of the cottager, as in the ample and magnificent garden of the noble. The truth of genuine charity is not e&s;ti|mated by the weight of what &s;he gives; and the mite of the indigent Old Maid, like that of the poor widow, may be &s;upe|rior in real merit to the mo&s;t &s;plendid do|nation. Charity is a theme, on which the &s;ublime&s;t &s;pirits have &s;o often and &s;o ably di&s;cour&s;ed; it is a virtue of &s;uch acknow|ledged value and lu&s;tre, that to &s;peak far|ther
<PB N="226" REF="242">
in its prai&s;e may appear like an at|tempt
<Q><L>to gild refined gold,</L>
<L>Or add a perfume to the violet.</L></Q>
Yet, after all the admirable things that have been written on this lovely pre&s;ident of the angelic virtues, it remains, I think, for me to &s;hew, why charity may with &s;ingular propriety be recommended to that fair and tender community, of which I have now, and, I hope, with no offen&s;ive arrogance, profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf the pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>The unhappine&s;s of ancient virgins often ari&s;es from a certain vacuity of heart, which is frequently the natural con&s;equence of their peculiar &s;ituation. I have &s;ometimes con&s;idered the Bo&s;om of an Old Maid as a kind of cell, in which it was intended that the lively bee, Affection, &s;hould trea&s;ure up its collected &s;weets; but this bee happen|ing to peri&s;h, before it could properly &s;ettle on the flowers that &s;hould afford its wealth, the vacant cell may unluckily become the
<PB N="227" REF="243">
abode of that drone Indifference, or of the wa&s;p Malignity. To &s;peak in le&s;s figura|tive language:&mdash;the want of proper objects to engage and employ that fund of tender|ne&s;s, which nature &s;eldom fails to be&s;tow on the female frame, may render the joyle&s;s unconnected &s;pin&s;ter both trouble&s;ome to her acquaintance, and a burthen to her&s;elf. Of all the different kinds of want, I appre|hend that, which originates in the heart, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t depre&s;&s;ing. The pains of di&s;appointed hunger and thir&s;t are un|doubtedly great; yet a de&s;tiny far more deplorable than that of Tantalus would be a&s;&s;igned to that being (if we may &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a being to exi&s;t) who, with a &s;pirit full of generous and kind affections, &s;hould never be allowed to indulge it&s;elf in a &s;ingle act or expre&s;&s;ion of genero&s;ity or kindne&s;s. Now the &s;olitary yet benevolent Old Maid, who has no hu&s;band to love, no child to idolize, and, perhaps, no friend to e&s;teem, would be almo&s;t reduced to the dreary and mi&s;erable condition which I have here
<PB N="228" REF="244">
imagined, were not charity, who has the power of &s;upplying even the tendere&s;t rela|tion, and of giving children to the child|le&s;s &mdash;were not charity, I &s;ay, both perfectly able, and perpetually ready. <Q>To fill the void left aching in the brea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>It is the privilege of charity to po&s;&s;e&s;s one &s;ignal advantage over &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent pa&s;&s;ions and virtues of the human &s;pirit. Ambition, love, and friend&s;hip, are not only &s;ubject to mortification and di&s;ap|pointment, but cannot even exi&s;t without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of time and chance. But charity is by no means the offspring or the &s;lave of accident, and all her delights are permanent and certain. It is po&s;&s;ible, that a heart, which nature has rendered capable of the mo&s;t tender and &s;ublime attachment, may wander through the wilderne&s;s of human life, without ta&s;ting the &s;weets either of love or friend&s;hip. But a charitable &s;pirit, though confined to the mo&s;t narrow and barren field of action, may find even there abundance of
<PB N="229" REF="245">
objects to call forth, and to reward, the mo&s;t &s;alutary and delightful exertions. I exhort, therefore, the &s;olitary Old Maid&mdash; who may be con&s;idered as the inhabitant of a wilderne&s;s, where the flowers of love are ut|terly withered, and tho&s;e of friend&s;hip very thinly &s;cattered&mdash;to make charity her fa|vourite and con&s;tant companion. She who does &s;o, will infallibly find, in the delight ari&s;ing from &s;uch intercour&s;e, an adequate and lively &s;ub&s;titute for all the more preca|rious plea&s;ures, of which the caprice of chance may have cruelly deprived her.</P>
<P>I was on the point of clo&s;ing my pre&s;ent chapter with the preceding exhortation, when an old acquaintance entered my &s;tudy, and, before he ended his vi&s;it, obliged me with a plea&s;ing and u&s;eful proof of genuine friend&s;hip, in a full and frank opinion of the newly-written pages that happened to lie before me. After &s;ome animating com|pliments on the de&s;ign and tendency of my work in general, by which my vanity was more flattered than it may become me, as a
<PB N="230" REF="246">
philo&s;opher, to confe&s;s, my friend proceeded in the following manner:&mdash; <Q>There ap|pears to me a deficiency in this part of your e&s;&s;ay, which time and chance have enabled me to &s;upply: you have, indeed, done ample ju&s;tice, in many points, to the amiable members of the &s;i&s;terhood; you have &s;ucce&s;sfully expo&s;ed the fal&s;e|hood of that vulgar and illiberal preju|dice, which concludes, that every Old Maid is a mortified being, whom the want of attractions, or the influence of accident, has reduced, again&s;t her will, to a very woeful condition; you have &s;hewn, on the contrary, by argument and example, that the ancient virgin may be a chearful and happy creature, com|pletely contented with a &s;tate, which &s;he has deliberately cho&s;en: but to di&s;charge your duty entirely to that injured and amiable community, who&s;e advocate you are, it remains for you, I think, to cele|brate &s;ome characters, who, without any tincture of Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, have de|voted
<PB N="231" REF="247">
them&s;elves to a life of virginity, from the pure and &s;ublime motives of friend&s;hip and affection. I have my|&s;elf,</Q> continued my in&s;tructor, <Q>the happine&s;s of having known two &s;ignal in&s;tances of that generous &s;acrifice, which, I think, you ought to commemorate; I &s;hall rejoice in &s;eeing the characters of my two friends immortalized in your benevolent e&s;&s;ay; you may introduce them to the admiration of your readers, under the titles of Angelica and Mele|tina. Eminent as they are in di&s;inte|re&s;ted virtue, you may include in a few pages, all that is material in the hi&s;tory of each.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Meletina is the accompli&s;hed daughter of opulent parents. Her mother died when &s;he was very young; her father, a man of a feeling and liberal mind, de|voted him&s;elf entirely to the education of his two lovely children, Meletina and her brother, who, being nearly of an age, and equal in all the be&s;t gifts of nature, grew
<PB N="232" REF="248">
up together in the tendere&s;t affection. It happened that Meletina, now turned of twenty, was on a di&s;tant vi&s;it, at the hou&s;e of a female relation, when &s;he heard that her father, whom &s;he loved mo&s;t tenderly, was attacked by a very dangerous di&s;or|der. The poor girl ha&s;tened home in the mo&s;t painful anxiety, which was con|verted into the bittere&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, by her finding, on her return, that her father was dead, and her brother confined by the malignant di&s;temper, which he had caught in his ince&s;&s;ant attendance on the parent they had lo&s;t. The utmo&s;t efforts were u&s;ed to keep Meletina from the chamber of her brother; but no entreaties could prevail on her to de&s;ert the only &s;urviving object of her ardent affection, and, de&s;pi&s;ing the idea of her own danger, &s;he attended the unhappy youth, who was now delirious, with &s;uch tender a&s;&s;iduity, that &s;he would not permit him to receive either nouri&s;hment or medicine from any hand but her own. The purity of her
<PB N="233" REF="249">
con&s;titution, or the immediate care of Providence, pre&s;erved the generous Me|letina from infection, and Heaven granted to her earne&s;t prayers the endangered life of her brother; but his recovery &s;eemed to be rather de&s;igned as a trial of her for|titude, than as a reward of her tenderne&s;s: his bodily health was re&s;tored to him, but his mental faculties were de&s;troyed. The unhappy Meletina, in the place of a lively young friend, and a generous pro|tector, found only a poor babbling idiot; who&s;e &s;ituation appeared to her the more deplorable, becau&s;e, though he had ut|terly lo&s;t a &s;olid and a brilliant under|&s;tanding, he &s;eemed to retain all his be|nevolent affections. By one peculiarity which attended him, &s;he was &s;ingularly affected; and, perhaps, it made her re|&s;olve on the extraordinary &s;acrifice, which &s;he has offered to his calamity. The pe|culiarity I &s;peak of was this: he not only di&s;covered great &s;atisfaction in the &s;ight of his &s;i&s;ter, though utterly unable to
<PB N="234" REF="250">
maintain a rational conver&s;ation with her; but if &s;he left him for any con&s;iderable time, he began to expre&s;s, by many wild ge&s;tures, extreme agitation and anxiety, and could never be prevailed on to touch any food, except in the pre&s;ence of Mele|tina. Many experiments were tried to quiet his apprehen&s;ions on this point, and to relieve his &s;i&s;ter from &s;o inconvenient and &s;o painful an attendance. The&s;e ex|periments did not &s;ucceed; but two me|dical friends of Meletina, who took a ge|nerous intere&s;t in her health and happi|ne&s;s, engaged to correct this peculiarity in her poor &s;en&s;ele&s;s brother, and con|vinced her, that for his &s;ake, as well as her own, &s;he ought to acquie&s;ce in &s;ome painful expedients for this purpo&s;e. Her under&s;tanding was, indeed, convinced by their humane and judicious arguments, but her heart &s;oon revolted again&s;t them; and, after two or three &s;evere but un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempts to correct the ob&s;tinate habit of the affectionate idiot; &s;he deter|mined
<PB N="235" REF="251">
to irritate him no farther, but to make an entire &s;acrifice of her own con|venience and plea&s;ure to the tranquillity of this unfortunate being. She felt a tender and melancholy delight in pro|moting his peace and comfort; but the time now arrived, in which the force and purity of her &s;i&s;terly attachment was ex|po&s;ed to a trial, perhaps as &s;evere as ever woman &s;u&s;tained. A year and &s;ome months had now elap&s;ed &s;ince the decea&s;e of her father, when a young &s;oldier of fa|mily and fortune, who had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on her youthful heart, returned to England from a di&s;tant campaign. He was ju&s;t recovered of a wound, which had detained him abroad, and returned home in the ardent hope of being completely rewarded for all his toils and &s;ufferings, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his lovely Meletina. She received him with all the frankne&s;s and warmth of a &s;incere and virtuous af|fection; but, after they had given to each other a long and circum&s;tantial account
<PB N="236" REF="252">
of their pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he an&s;wered his eager propo&s;al of immediate marriage, by declaring, that &s;he thought it her duty to renounce her fair pro&s;pect of connubial happine&s;s, and to devote her&s;elf entirely to that unfortunate brother, who exi&s;ted only by her ince&s;&s;ant attention: &s;he enu|merated the many rea&s;ons that inclined her to &s;uch a painful &s;acrifice, with all the &s;imple and pathetic eloquence of an|gelic virtue. Her lover, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that melting tenderne&s;s of heart, which often accompanies heroic courage, li&s;|tened to all her arguments with a &s;ilent though pa&s;&s;ionate admiration, and, in&s;tead of attempting to detach her thoughts from the deplorable condition of her bro|ther, he offered to relinqui&s;h his own active pur&s;uits, to engage with her in any plan of &s;eque&s;tered life, and to take an equal part in the &s;uperintendance of that haple&s;s being, who had &s;o ju&s;t a title to their compa&s;&s;ion and their care. This generous offer overwhelmed the tender
<PB N="237" REF="253">
Meletina. For &s;ome time &s;he could an|&s;wer it only by weeping; but they were tears of mingled agony and delight. At la&s;t &s;he replied, "My excellent friend, I &s;hall now, and at all times, have the frankne&s;s to avow, that you are extremely dear to me, and that I feel, as I ought to do, the uncommon proof which you are now giving me of the pure&s;t affection; but I mu&s;t not &s;uffer the kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity of your heart to injure your happine&s;s and glory. I mu&s;t not be your wife. The peculiarity of my &s;ituation calls for &s;o painful a &s;acrifice; but great &s;acrifices have great rewards; I feel that I &s;hall be &s;upported by the noble pride, not only of di&s;charging my duty, but of pre&s;erving your tender e&s;teem, which I &s;hould certainly de&s;erve to forfeit, as well as my own, if I did not re&s;olutely decline your too generous propo&s;al." The af|fectionate young &s;oldier endeavoured to &s;hake her re&s;olution, by every argument that the truth and ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="238" REF="254">
could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t. Meletina was in|flexible; and the utmo&s;t that her lover could obtain, was a promi&s;e, that if, by attention and time, &s;he &s;ucceeded in her hope of re&s;toring the intellects of her brother, &s;he would complete the &s;cene of general happine&s;s, which that joyful event would occa&s;ion, by the immediate ac|ceptance of that hand, which &s;he now re|jected only from the ju&s;t &s;cruples of ge|nuine affection. Having thus &s;ettled their very delicate conte&s;t, they parted. The &s;oldier rejoined his regiment; but, in &s;pite of military di&s;&s;ipation, continued for a long time to write very tender letters to the generous Meletina. At la&s;t, how|ever, whether his pa&s;&s;ion was dimini&s;hed by its de&s;pair of being gratified, or whe|ther the purity of a cha&s;te attachment is incompatible with a martial life, while he was engaged in dangerous and di&s;tant &s;ervice, he was deeply involved in a very perplexing illicit intrigue, which would probably have given him many years of
<PB N="239" REF="255">
di&s;quietude, had not the chance of war put an early period to his life: a mu&s;ket|ball pa&s;&s;ed through his body; but he lived long enough to write an affectionate parting letter to Meletina, in which he confe&s;&s;ed his frailties, extolled her angelic purity of heart, and entreated her to do, what he &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured her he did him|&s;elf, con&s;ider both the time and the man|ner of his death, not as a misfortune, but a ble&s;&s;ing. Meletina lamented him when dead, as &s;he had loved him living, with the mo&s;t faithful tenderne&s;s; &s;he mourned for him as for a hu&s;band; and, though many years have elap&s;ed &s;ince his decea&s;e, a grey &s;ilk is to this day her con&s;tant ap|parel. Nor is there any oftentation in this peculiarity of her dre&s;s; for her at|tendance on her brother is &s;till &s;o uni|form, that &s;he never appears in public, and, indeed, is never ab&s;ent from her own hou&s;e more than two or three hours at a time. From habit, and the affec|tionate ca&s;t of her temper, &s;he takes a
<PB N="240" REF="256">
plea&s;ure in the petty childi&s;h plays by which her haple&s;s companion is amu&s;ed; and, &s;o far from &s;inking her&s;elf into a &s;tate of indolence or apathy, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great delicacy of manners, and all the &s;trength and lu&s;tre of a refined under&s;tanding. She is now turned of fifty; and, though her countenance, when &s;he is &s;ilent, has an air of mild and touching melancholy, her conver&s;ation is animated and chear|ful. As her brother plea&s;es him&s;elf by the habit of ri&s;ing and going to re&s;t with the lark, &s;he has the long winter evenings entirely to her&s;elf; and at this &s;ea&s;on &s;he has a great &s;hare of &s;ocial enjoyment, by receiving the vi&s;its of her &s;elected friends. To the&s;e &s;he is remarkably open and un|re&s;erved, and has a peculiar plea&s;ure in talking over the extraordinary occur|rences of her early life. This circle, in|deed, is &s;mall, though it is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed an honour to &s;hare the friend&s;hip of Me|letina, and tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it have the happine&s;s of knowing, perhaps, the mo&s;t
<PB N="241" REF="257">
&s;ingular and mo&s;t intere&s;ting of ancient virgins.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If any one might di&s;pute this pre-emi|nence with Meletina, it mu&s;t be, I think, the more fortunate Angelica, who lived the life of a ve&s;tal from motives equally amiable, but in a &s;tate of tranquillity and delight.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Angelica was the only child of a wor|thy gentleman, who, having lo&s;t his wife, and dying him&s;elf during the infancy of his daughter, left her, with an e&s;tate of about a thou&s;and a year, to the care of his mo&s;t intimate friend, a man of great integrity and benevolence, with a mode|rate fortune and a numerous family. An|gelica grew up in the mo&s;t affectionate intimacy with all the children of her ex|cellent guardian; but her favourite friend was his elde&s;t daughter, whom we will call Fau&s;tina. She was born in the &s;ame year with Angelica, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame intelligent &s;weetne&s;s of temper, with the additional advantages of a beautiful
<PB N="242" REF="258">
countenance and a maje&s;tic per&s;on. An|gelica had never any claim to either of the&s;e perfections: her &s;tature was rather below the common &s;ize, and her features, though &s;oftened by mode&s;ty, and ani|mated by a lively under&s;tanding, were neither regular nor hand&s;ome; but, from the tenor of her life, it may be que&s;tioned, if any female ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a more beau|tiful &s;oul. At the age of twenty-three &s;he continued to re&s;ide in the hou&s;e of her guardian, when a young man of a plea&s;ing per&s;on and mo&s;t engaging man|ners, to whom we will give the name of Eumenes, became a very a&s;&s;iduous vi|&s;iter at that hou&s;e. He was a man of the faire&s;t character, but of a narrow fortune; and many good people, who &s;uppo&s;ed him enamoured of Angelica's e&s;tate, began to cen&s;ure the guardian of that lady for encouraging the preliminary &s;teps to &s;o unequal a match; they even foretold, as Eumenes was particularly at|tentive to Angelica, and often alone with
<PB N="243" REF="259">
her, that the young gentleman would &s;oon &s;ettle him&s;elf in life, by eloping with the heire&s;s. Her guardian, who governed all his hou&s;hold by gentlene&s;s and affec|tion, had too much confidence in his ward to apprehend &s;uch an event: but he began to think, that a &s;erious and mu|tual pa&s;&s;ion was taking root in the bo&s;om of each party; an opinion in which he was confirmed, by ob&s;erving, that while his daughter was engaged in a di&s;tant vi&s;it of &s;ome weeks, Eumenes continued to frequent the hou&s;e with his u&s;ual a&s;&s;i|duity, and &s;eemed to court the &s;ociety of Angelica. The old gentleman was, how|ever, mi&s;taken in one part of his conjec|ture; for Eumenes only &s;ought the com|pany of Angelica as the &s;en&s;ible and plea&s;ing friend of his ab&s;ent favourite: but as he had not yet confe&s;&s;ed his love, the gentle Angelica, like her guardian, mi&s;interpreted his a&s;&s;iduity, and con|ceived for him the tendere&s;t affection; which, with her u&s;ual frankne&s;s, &s;he de|termined
<PB N="244" REF="260">
to impart to her dear Fau&s;tina, as &s;oon as &s;he returned. From this re&s;olution &s;he was accidentally diverted by a joyous confu&s;ion, which di&s;covered it&s;elf both in the features and behaviour of Fau&s;tina, who, on the very day of her return, eagerly put a letter into the hand of Angelica, and reque&s;ted her to read it in her chamber, while &s;he flew to con|ver&s;e in private with her father on its important contents. The letter was from Eumenes. It contained a pa&s;&s;ionate de|claration of his attachment to Fau&s;tina, and a very romantic plan to facilitate their &s;peedy marriage. What the feel|ings of Angelica mu&s;t have been in the peru&s;al of this letter, I &s;hall leave the lively female imagination to &s;uppo&s;e, and only &s;ay, that, having &s;ubdued all traces of her own painful emotion before Fau&s;tina had fini&s;hed her conference with her father, &s;he entered their apartment. She found her friend in tears, and the benevolent old gentleman endeavouring
<PB N="245" REF="261">
to make his agitated daughter &s;mile again, by treating the propo&s;al as, a je&s;t, and de|claring that he would con&s;ent to the union of two tender romantic lovers, as &s;oon as they could marry without a pro|&s;pect of &s;tarving; which, he &s;aid, from the expectations of Eumenes, they might po&s;&s;ibly accompli&s;h in the cour&s;e of twenty years. The generous Angelica in&s;tantly became the patrone&s;s of Eu|menes and Fau&s;tina; &s;he interceded for their being immediately allowed to form the happine&s;s of each other, and, to ob|viate every parental objection to the match, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ettling half her fortune upon them, with a propo&s;al of becoming a part of their family.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The guardian of Angelica treated her romantic idea with a mixture of admira|tion and ridicule; Eumenes and Fau&s;tina regarded it with the mo&s;t &s;erious grati|tude, but at the &s;ame time rejected the too generous offer, with a re&s;olution &s;o noble and &s;incere, that it increa&s;ed the ar|dent
<PB N="246" REF="262">
de&s;ire which Angelica felt, to make her own ea&s;y fortune the &s;ole in&s;trument of their general happine&s;s: but all her li|beral efforts for this purpo&s;e were as libe|rally oppo&s;ed, and all &s;he could obtain was a promi&s;e from her guardian, to allow the lovers to cheri&s;h their affection for each other, and to marry as &s;oon as Eu|menes, who had ju&s;t taken orders, &s;hould obtain preferment &s;ufficient to &s;upport a wife. This, however, was an event which the worthy father of Fau&s;tina had not the happine&s;s of &s;eeing: he died in the following year; and Angelica, who had no longer any controller to appre|hend in the management of her fortune, renewed her former generous propo&s;al to her friends. They per&s;evered in their magnanimous refu&s;al of her bounty, though &s;ome family circum&s;tances made them peculiarly anxious to &s;ettle together as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, on any &s;lender provi&s;ion. An event, however, &s;oon happened, which enabled them to marry without any tre&s;|pa&s;s
<PB N="247" REF="263">
on the rules of oeconomical di&s;cre|tion. Eumenes was unexpectedly pre|&s;ented to one of the mo&s;t valuable livings in the kingdom, by a nobleman, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed to give it him in con&s;equence of a juvenile and almo&s;t forgotten friend&s;hip with his decea&s;ed father. This &s;urpri&s;ing &s;troke of good fortune made the lovers and their &s;ympathetic friend completely happy. The wedding was &s;oon adju&s;ted. Angelica &s;ettled her&s;elf in a plea&s;ant villa, within a few miles of the wealthy rector; who was &s;urrounded in a few years with a very promi&s;ing family: &s;he &s;hared, and contributed not a little to, the happine&s;s of her friends, being frequently at their hou&s;e; and, when &s;he returned to her own, being con&s;tantly accompanied by one or two of the little ones. She had a peculiar de|light, and was &s;ingularly &s;kilful in the cultivation of young minds. She rejected &s;everal offers of marriage, and her general an&s;wer was, that &s;he would never change her &s;tate, becau&s;e &s;he already enjoyed the
<PB N="248" REF="264">
highe&s;t plea&s;ure that human life can be|&s;tow, in the &s;hare which her friends al|lowed her to take in the education of their lovely children. Eumenes and Fau&s;tina vied with each other in doing ju&s;tice to the virtues and talents of this admirable woman, and, through many years of the mo&s;t familiar and friendly in|tercour&s;e with her, they continued to re|gard her with increa&s;ing e&s;teem; yet &s;he had &s;ome &s;ecret merits, to which they were utter &s;trangers, till death had robbed them, for ever of her engaging &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P><Q>About four years ago the excellent Angelica contracted an epidemical fever, and departed to a better world, at the age of forty-&s;even. She left the bulk of her fortune to be divided equally among the children of Fau&s;tina; and there was found, in a little cabinet which contained her will, the following extraordinary letter to that lady:</Q>
<LETTER>
<PB N="249" REF="265">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My very dear friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Having enjoyed your entire confi|dence from our infancy, I think my&s;elf bound to apologi&s;e to you, for having re|turned it, during &s;everal years, with di&s;|gui&s;e and delu&s;ion. Be not &s;tartled at this &s;urpri&s;ing intelligence&mdash;but why do I &s;ay &s;tartled? the moments for &s;uch ter|ror will be pa&s;t, and you will be able to feel only a melancholy tenderne&s;s towards your beloved Angelica, when you read this paper, as it is not to reach you till &s;he is no more: perhaps it may never reach you; yet I hope it will. I pray to Heaven that you may &s;urvive me, and in that comfortable expectation I &s;hall here pour forth to you my whole heart.</P>
<P>You may remember, that when we were fir&s;t enlivened by the acquaintance of Eumenes, I was frequently rallied on his attention to me: as that attention was &s;ufficient to mi&s;lead the vanity of any girl, I need not blu&s;h in confe&s;&s;ing to you its
<PB N="250" REF="266">
effect upon me&mdash;I forgot, in your ab&s;ence, the &s;uperiority of your attractions, and, credulou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ing that the affection of Eumenes was &s;ettled on my&s;elf, I ha&s;tily gave him my heart. As I never de&s;igned, however, that this fooli&s;h heart &s;hould hide any of its foibles from my Fau&s;tina, I was preparing to tell you the true &s;tate of it, when you imparted to me the &s;ur|pri&s;ing important letter, which declared the wi&s;er choice of Eumenes. Yes, my dear, I &s;ay &s;incerely, the wi&s;er choice, and &s;hall prove it &s;o. Remember that I am now &s;peaking as from the grave, and you will not &s;u&s;pect me of flattery.&mdash;But to return to that heart-&s;earching letter. I will confe&s;s to you, that I wept bitterly for &s;ome minutes, as &s;oon as I had fir&s;t peru&s;ed it. I felt as fooli&s;h as a child, who, having built for the fir&s;t time a ca&s;tle of cards, &s;ees it &s;uddenly over|thrown. But my heart &s;oon corrected the errors of my vain imagination: I began to commune with my own &s;oul; I &s;aid to my&s;elf, why am I thus mortified?
<PB N="251" REF="267">
what is my wi&s;h? is it not to &s;ee and to make Eumenes happy? and is not this &s;till in my power? not, indeed, as a wife, &s;ince he has judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en a lovely girl, much more likely to &s;ucceed in that character; but &s;till as the friend of two excellent creatures, formed for each other, and equally dear to me. It was thus I rea&s;oned with my&s;elf. My benevolence and my pride were highly flattered in this &s;elf-debate; and it gave me &s;pirit to act towards you both in the manner you well remember. It hurt me much to find, that my darling propo&s;al for your &s;peedy union was thwarted &s;o long, &s;hall I &s;ay, by your noblene&s;s of nature, or by your fal&s;e delicacy? I believe I called it at the time by the latter name, being thoroughly per&s;uaded, that in your condition I would have accepted from you the offer which I made. At length, however, the time ar|rived, in which I was enabled to accom|pli&s;h, in a manner unknown to you, the darling object of my ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="268">
Allow me, my deare&s;t friends, to boa&s;t in this paper, that I have been the invi&s;ible architect of the happine&s;s which we have now enjoyed together for many years. It was the un&s;een hand of your Angelica, that made you the happy wife of Eumenes, by placing him in that pre|ferment, to which his virtues have given him &s;o ju&s;t a title. How I was fortu|nately enabled to make, and to conceal, &s;o de&s;irable a purcha&s;e, you will perfectly comprehend, from the collection of papers which I &s;hall leave in the cabinet with my will and this letter. As long as the di&s;covery could wound your hone&s;t pride, by a load of imaginary obligation, I de|termined never to make it; but, &s;o &s;trange is human pride! we are never hurt by the idea of obligation to the dead; and remember, as I &s;aid once be|fore, that I am now &s;peaking from the grave. By this conduct I am humour|ing, at one and the &s;ame time, both your pride and my own; for I will here avow,
<PB N="253" REF="269">
that I am very ambitious of increa&s;ing, after my death, that pure and perfect re|gard which ye have both &s;hewn, through the cour&s;e of many &s;ocial years, to your living Angelica.&mdash;But, while I am thus &s;oliciting an increa&s;e of your affection, let me guard that very affection from one painful exce&s;s. I know you both &s;o well, that I am almo&s;t &s;ure you will exclaim together, on fir&s;t reading the&s;e papers, Good God, what a generous creature, to make &s;uch a &s;acrifice of her&s;elf for our &s;akes! But, affectionate as the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions may be, they will be far from ju&s;t. Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear friends&mdash;and I now &s;peak the language of &s;ober rea&s;on&mdash;I have made <HI>no &s;acrifice</HI>; &s;o far from it, I am convinced, from a long and &s;erious &s;urvey of human life, that the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h and worldly being could not have pur|&s;ued any &s;y&s;tem more conducive to their own private intere&s;t and advantage than mine has been. You will agree with me in this truth, when I impart to you &s;ome
<PB N="254" REF="270">
of my own philo&s;ophical remarks, I will begin with one of the mo&s;t impor|tant, and it will &s;urpri&s;e you; it is this&mdash; I am thoroughly convinced, that I &s;hould not have been happy, had I been, what I once ardently hoped to be, the wife of Eumenes. Hear my rea&s;on, and &s;ub|&s;cribe to its truth. Amiable as he is, he is a little ha&s;ty in his temper; and this circum&s;tance would have been &s;ufficient to make us unhappy; for, even &s;uppo&s;ing I had been able to treat it with the in|dulgent good &s;en&s;e of his gentle Fau&s;tina, yet all the good-humour that I could have put, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, into my homely vi&s;age, would have had but a &s;low effect in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e frequent &s;parks of irritation, which are extin|gui&s;hed in a moment by one of her lovely &s;miles. Take it, my dear, as one of my maxims, that every man of ha&s;ty &s;pirit ought to have a very hand&s;ome wife; for, although &s;en&s;e and good temper in the lady may be the e&s;&s;ential remedies
<PB N="255" REF="271">
for this ma&s;culine foible; yet, believe me, their operation is quickened tenfold by the heart-piercing light of a beau|tiful countenance. I was led to this remark by a very painful &s;cene, which once pa&s;&s;ed between Eumenes and me: he was angry with me for taking the part of his &s;on Charles, in a little di&s;pute be|tween them; and, though I argued the point with him very calmly, he &s;aid &s;harply, after the boy had quitted the room, that I &s;hewed, indeed, much fond|ne&s;s to the child, but no true friend&s;hip to the father. The expre&s;&s;ion &s;tung me &s;o deeply, that I no longer retained a per|fect command over my own temper; and, to convince him of the truth and the ex|tent of that friend&s;hip, which he ar|raigned &s;o unju&s;tly, I &s;hould certainly have betrayed the darling &s;ecret of my life, which I had re&s;olved to keep invio|late to the end of my days, had not the &s;udden appearance of my dear Fau&s;tina &s;ugge&s;ted to me all the affectionate rea|&s;ons
<PB N="256" REF="272">
for my &s;ecrecy, and thus re&s;tored me to my&s;elf. Her &s;miles now &s;hewed their very great &s;uperiority over my argu|ments; for, almo&s;t without the aid of words, but with a &s;weetne&s;s of manner peculiar to her&s;elf, &s;he reconciled, in a few minutes, the too ha&s;ty father, not only to poor Charles, but to the more childi&s;h Angelica. This, I believe, was the only time that I was in danger of be|traying a &s;ecret, which I had, I think, ju|diciou&s;ly impo&s;ed upon my&s;elf; for my di&s;gui&s;e on this point, as it equally con|&s;ulted our mutual pride and delicacy (whether true or fal&s;e delicacy no matter) has, I conceive, been very favourable to our general happine&s;s; to my own I am &s;ure it has. In all tho&s;e moments of &s;pleen or depre&s;&s;ion, to which, I believe, every mortal is in &s;ome degree &s;ubject, nothing has relieved me &s;o much as the animating recollection, that I have been the unknown architect of my friends feli|city. There is &s;omething angelic in the

idea, &s;upremely flattering to the hone&s;t pride of a feeling heart. Yet, plea&s;ed as I have ever been with the review of my own conduct, which the world might de|ride as romantic, I would by no means recommend it to another female in my &s;ituation; not from an idea that &s;he might not be as di&s;intere&s;ted as my&s;elf, but le&s;t in her friend &s;he &s;hould not find a Fau&s;tina; for it has not been my own virtue, but the virtues of my lovely ini|mitable friend, which have given the full &s;ucce&s;s to my project. Had my Fau&s;tina and Eumenes lived, like many other mar|ried folks, in &s;cenes of frequent bicker|ing or debate, I &s;hould, I doubt not, like many other good &s;pin&s;ters, who are wit|ne&s;&s;es of &s;uch connubial altercation, have entertained the vain idea that I could have managed the temper of the lordly creature much better, and, of cour&s;e, &s;hould have been very re&s;tle&s;s that I was not his wife: but, to do full ju&s;tice to the uncommon merits of my incomparable

Fau&s;tina, I here mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare to her, I never, &s;ince her marriage, beheld or thought of her and Eumenes, without a full per&s;ua&s;ion that Heaven had made them for each other.&mdash;But it is high time to fini&s;h this &s;ingular confe&s;&s;ion, in which, perhaps, I have indulged my&s;elf too long. I will only add my prayers, that Heaven may continue health and human happine&s;s to my two friends, be|yond the period a&s;&s;igned to my mortal exi&s;tence; and that, whenever I may cea&s;e to enjoy their friend&s;hip on earth, they will tenderly forget all the foibles, and mutually cheri&s;h the memory, of their affectionate</P>

<P><Q>This generous Old Maid di&s;played al&s;o in her will, which &s;he compo&s;ed her|&s;elf, many touching marks of her affec|tionate &s;pirit.&mdash;The hou&s;e in which &s;he re&s;ided, &s;he left as a little legacy to Fau&s;tina, and reque&s;ted her friends to re|move

into it upon her decea&s;e, that Fau&s;tina might not be expo&s;ed to a more painful removal, if &s;he &s;hould hap|pen to &s;urvive her hu&s;band. As &s;he knew that a compliance with this reque&s;t would lead her friends into &s;ome depre&s;|&s;ive &s;en&s;ations, &s;he contrived to furni&s;h them with an engaging though melan|choly occupation, by reque&s;ting them to build a kind of monument to her&s;elf, under the form of a little temple to Friend|&s;hip, on a favourite &s;pot in the garden.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing, perhaps, can equal the un|common genero&s;ity of Angelica, but the tender and unaffected &s;orrow with which her lo&s;s has been lamented. The mo&s;t trivial of her reque&s;ts has been religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, and the whole family of Eu|menes &s;eem to think no plea&s;ure equal to that of doing ju&s;tice to her merit, and proclaiming their unexampled obligations to their departed friend.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="276">SUCH is the hi&s;tory of the&s;e two amiable ancient virgins, which I have now given to my reader, with the &s;anction of the bene|volent critic, to whom we are indebted for an acquaintance with &s;uch intere&s;ting vir|tue. It mu&s;t, I think, be allowed, that two members of &s;uch engaging excellence are alone &s;ufficient to ennoble any community; and, I flatter my&s;elf, the mild lu&s;tre of their characters will reflect a degree of glory on the &s;i&s;terhood, and rai&s;e it con&s;iderably in the e&s;timation of the world. Perhaps, if a ju&s;t chronicle of Old Maids had been kept &s;ince the creation, it would have pre|&s;ented to us many &s;imilar examples of ten|der magnanimity.</P>
<P>But, as I have remarked already, the &s;i&s;terhood has unhappily had no herald to immortali&s;e their perfections, except, in|deed, the pious old maidens of the Romi&s;h church: they certainly have not wanted their full &s;hare of celebration. But of the&s;e, and of their elder and more neglected &s;i&s;ters, the ancient virgins of a remoter pe|riod.

I &s;hall &s;peak at large in the &s;ub&s;equent part of this E&s;&s;ay. I &s;hall there, to the ut|mo&s;t of my abilities, collect all the &s;catter|ed rays of light, with which antiquity can &s;upply me, for the illu&s;tration of my inte|re&s;ting &s;ubject. To rival the curious re|&s;earches of our pre&s;ent mo&s;t celebrated an|tiquarians, and, in the wide field which I have cho&s;en, to leave no bu&s;h or bramble unexplored, I &s;hall examine, in the fir&s;t chapter of my &s;econd volume, if there ever exi&s;ted an antediluvian Old Maid.</P>
