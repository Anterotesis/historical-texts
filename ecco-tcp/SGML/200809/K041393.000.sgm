<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON THE PINDARIQUE ODE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Ode is an Attempt towards re&s;toring the Regularity of the Ancient Lyrick Poetry, which &s;eems to be altogether forgotten or unknown by our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers.</P>
<P>There is nothing more frequent among us, than a &s;ort of Poems intituled Pinda|rique Odes; pretending to be written in Imitation of the Manner and Stile of <HI>Pin|dar,</HI> and yet I do not know that there is to this Day extant in our Language, one Ode contriv'd after his Model. What Idea can an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader have of <HI>Pin|dar,</HI> (to who&s;e Mouth, when a Child, the Bees<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pau&s;an. Boeotic.</NOTE> brought their Honey, in Omen of the future Sweetne&s;s and Melody of his Songs) when he &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch rumbling and grating Papers of Ver&s;es, pretending to be Copies of his Works?</P>
<P>The Character of the&s;e late Pindariques, is a Bundle of rambling incoherent Thoughts, expre&s;s'd in a like parcel of irregular Stanza's, which al&s;o con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch another Complication of di&s;proportion'd, uncertain and perplex'd Ver&s;es and Rhimes. And I appeal to any Reader, if this is not the Condition in which the&s;e Titular Odes appear.</P>
<P>On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the Odes of <HI>Pindar,</HI> both as to the exact Ob&s;ervation of the Mea&s;ures and Numbers of his Stanza's and Ver&s;es, and the perpetual Coherence of his Thoughts. For tho' his Digre&s;&s;ions are frequent, and his Tran&s;itions &s;udden, yet is there ever &s;ome &s;ecret Connexion, which tho' not always appearing to the Eye, never fails to communicate it &s;elf to the Under&s;tanding of the Reader.</P>
<P>The Liberty which he took in his Numbers, and which has been &s;o mi&s;under|&s;tood and mi&s;apply'd by his pretended Imitators, was only in varying the Stanza's in different Odes; but in each particular Ode they are ever Corre&s;pondent one to another in their Turns, and according to the Order of the Ode.</P>
<P>All the Odes of <HI>Pindar</HI> are Songs of Triumph, Victory or Succe&s;s in the <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Games: They were &s;ung by a Chorus, and adapted to the <HI>Lyre,</HI> and &s;ometimes
<PB REF="3">
to the <HI>Lyre</HI> and <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pind. Olym.</HI> 10.</NOTE><HI>Pipe;</HI> they con&s;i&s;ted oftne&s;t of Three Stanza's, the fir&s;t was call'd the <HI>Stroph&eacute;,</HI> from the Ver&s;ion or circular Motion of the Singers in that Stanza from the Right Hand to the Left.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Or from the Left to the Right, for the <HI>Scholia&s;ts</HI> differ in that, as may be &s;een in <HI>Pind.

See <HI>Era&s;. Schmid. Prolegom. in Olymp. &amp; de Carmin. Lyric.</HI></NOTE> The &s;econd Stanza was call'd the <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> from the Contraver&s;ion of the <HI>Chorus;</HI> the Singers, in performing that, turning from the Left Hand to the Right, contrary always to their Motion in the <HI>Stroph&eacute;.</HI> The Third Stanza was call'd the <HI>Epode,</HI> (it may be as being the After-&s;ong) which they &s;ung in the middle, neither turning to one Hand nor the other.</P>
<P>What the Origin was of the&s;e different Motions and Stations in &s;inging their Odes, is not our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire. Some have thought that by the Contrariety of the <HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> they intended to repre&s;ent the Contrarotation of the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> in re&s;pect of the <HI>Secunda Mobilia;</HI> and that by their &s;tanding &s;till at the <HI>Epode,</HI> they meant to &s;ignifie the Stability of the Earth.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pind. Schol. &amp; Schmid.</HI> ibid.</NOTE> Others a&s;cribe the In&s;titution to <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> who thereby ex|pre&s;&s;ed the Windings and Turnings of the Labyrinth in celebrating his Return from thence.</P>
<P>The Method ob&s;erv'd in the Compo&s;ition of the&s;e Odes, was therefore as fol|lows. The Poet having made choice of a certain Number of Ver&s;es to con|&s;titute his <HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> or fir&s;t <HI>Stanza,</HI> was oblig'd to ob&s;erve the &s;ame in his <HI>An|ti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> or &s;econd <HI>Stanza;</HI> and which accordingly perpetually agreed whenever repeated, both in number of Ver&s;es and quantity of Feet: He was then again at liberty, to make a new choice for his third <HI>Stanza,</HI> or <HI>Epode;</HI> where, accordingly, he diver&s;ify'd his Numbers as his Ear or Fancy led him; compo|&s;ing that <HI>Stanza</HI> of more or fewer Ver&s;es than the former, and tho&s;e Ver&s;es of different Mea&s;ures and Quantities, for the greater Variety of Harmony, and Entertainment of the Ear.</P>
<P>But then this <HI>Epode</HI> being thus form'd, he was &s;trictly oblig'd to the &s;ame <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. Jul. Scal. Poetic. ad Fin. Cap.</HI> 97. <HI>l.</HI> 3.</NOTE>Mea&s;ure, as often as he &s;hould repeat it in the order of his Ode, &s;o that every <HI>Epode</HI> in the &s;ame Ode is eternally the &s;ame in Mea&s;ure and Quantity, in re&s;pect to it &s;elf; as is al&s;o every <HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> in re&s;pect to each other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lyrick</HI> Poet <HI>Ste&s;ichorus</HI> (whom <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Longin. de Sub. c.</HI> 13.</NOTE><HI>Longinus</HI> reckons among&s;t the able&s;t Imitators of <HI>Homer,</HI> and of whom <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Quint.

Era&s;m. Adag.</HI></NOTE><HI>ne tria quidem Ste&s;ichori no&s;ti;</HI> &s;o that when any one had a mind to reproach another with
<PB REF="4">
exce&s;&s;ive Ignorance, he could not do it more effectually than by telling him, <HI>he did not &s;o much as know the Three Stanza's of</HI> Ste&s;ichorus; that is, did not know that an Ode ought to con&s;i&s;t of a <HI>Stroph&eacute;,</HI> an <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> and an <HI>Epode.</HI> If this was &s;uch a mark of Ignorance among them, I am &s;ure we have been pretty long liable to the &s;ame Reproof; I mean, in re&s;pect of our Imitations of the Odes of <HI>Pindar.</HI></P>
<P>My Intention is not to make a long Preface to a &s;hort Ode, nor to enter upon a Di&s;&s;ertation of Lyrick Poetry in general: But thus much I thought proper to &s;ay, for the Information of tho&s;e Readers who&s;e Cour&s;e of Study has not led 'em into &s;uch Enquiries.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall not be &s;o mi&s;under&s;tood, as to have it thought that I pretend to give an exact Copy of <HI>Pindar</HI> in this en&s;uing Ode; or that I look upon it as a Pattern for his Imitators for the future: Far from &s;uch Thoughts, I have only given an In&s;tance of what is practicable, and am &s;en&s;ible that I am as di&s;tant from the Force and Elevation of <HI>Pindar,</HI> as others have hitherto been from the Harmony and Regularity of his Numbers.</P>
<P>Again, we having no <HI>Chorus</HI> to &s;ing our Odes, the Titles, as well as U&s;e of <HI>Strophe, Anti&s;trophe,</HI> and <HI>Epode,</HI> are Ob&s;olete and Impertinent: And certainly there may be very good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Odes, without the Di&s;tinction of <HI>Greek</HI> Appellations to their Stanza's. That I have mention'd 'em here, and ob&s;erv'd the Order of 'em in the en&s;uing Ode, is therefore only the more intel|ligibly to explain the extraordinary Regularity of the Compo&s;ition of tho&s;e Odes, which have been repre&s;ented to us hitherto, as the mo&s;t confus'd Structures in Nature.</P>
<P>However, tho' there be no nece&s;&s;ity that our Triumphal Odes &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of the Three afore-mention'd Stanza's; yet if the Reader can ob&s;erve that the great Variation of the Numbers in the Third Stanza (call it <HI>Epode,</HI> or what you plea&s;e) has a plea&s;ing Effect in the Ode, and makes him return to the Fir&s;t and Second Stanza's, with more Appetite, than he could do if always cloy'd with the &s;ame Quantities and Mea&s;ures, I cannot &s;ee why &s;ome U&s;e may not be made of <HI>Pindar</HI>'s Example, to the great Improvement of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ode. There is certainly a Plea&s;ure in beholding any Thing that has Art and Difficulty in the Contrivance; e&s;pecially, if it appears &s;o carefully executed, that the Difficulty does not &s;hew it &s;elf, 'till it is &s;ought for; and that the &s;eeming Ea&s;ine&s;s of the Work, fir&s;t &s;ets us upon the Enquiry. Nothing can be call'd Beautiful without Proportion. When Symmetry and Harmony are wanting, nei|ther the Eye nor the Ear can be pleas'd. Therefore certainly <HI>Poetry,</HI> which includes Painting and Mu&s;ick, &s;hould not be de&s;titute of 'em; and of all <HI>Poetry,</HI> e&s;pecially the <HI>Ode,</HI> who&s;e End and E&s;&s;ence is Harmony.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> in his Preface to his Pindarique Odes, &s;peaking of the Mu|&s;ick of Numbers, &s;ays, <HI>which &s;ometimes (e&s;pecially in Songs and Odes) almo&s;t without any thing el&s;e makes an Excellent Poet.</HI></P>
<P>Having mention'd Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> it may very well be expected, that &s;ome|thing &s;hould be &s;aid of him, at a time when the Imitation of <HI>Pindar</HI> is the
<PB REF="5">
Theme of our Di&s;cour&s;e. But there is that great Deference due to the Me|mory, great Parts, and Learning of that Gentleman, that I think nothing &s;hould be objected to the Latitude he has taken in his Pindarique Odes. The Beauty of his Ver&s;es, are an Attonement for the Irregularity of his Stanza's; and tho' he did not imitate <HI>Pindar</HI> in the Strictne&s;s of his Numbers, he has very often happily copy'd him in the Force of his Figures, and Sublimity of his Stile and Sentiments.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t beg leave to add, that I believe tho&s;e irregular Odes of Mr. <HI>Cow|ley,</HI> may have been the principal, tho' innocent Occa&s;ion of &s;o many deformed Poems &s;ince, which in&s;tead of being true Pictures of <HI>Pindar,</HI> have (to u&s;e the <HI>Italian</HI> Painters Term) been only <HI>Caricatura</HI>'s of him, Re&s;emblances that for the mo&s;t part have been either Horrid or Ridiculous.</P>
<P>For my own part I frankly own my Error, in having heretofore mi&s;-call'd a few irregular <HI>Stanza</HI>'s a Pindarique Ode; and po&s;&s;ibly, if others, who have been under the &s;ame Mi&s;take, would ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s the Truth, they might own, that never having con&s;ulted <HI>Pindar</HI> him&s;elf, they took all his Irregularity upon tru&s;t; and finding their Account in the great Ea&s;e with which they could produce Odes, without being oblig'd either to Mea&s;ure or De&s;ign, remain'd &s;a|tisfy'd; and it may be were not altogether unwilling to neglect being un|deceiv'd.</P>
<P>Tho' there be little (if any thing) left of <HI>Orpheus</HI> but his Name, yet if <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Boeotic. pag.</HI> 588.</NOTE><HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> was well inform'd, we may be a&s;&s;ur'd that <HI>Brevity</HI> was a Beauty which he mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly labour'd to pre&s;erve in his <HI>Hymns,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing, as the &s;ame Author reports, that they were but few in Number.</P>
<P>The Shortne&s;s of the following Ode will, I hope, attone for the Length of the Preface, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the Defects which may be found in it. It con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame Number of Stanza's with that beautiful Ode of <HI>Pin|dar,</HI> which is the fir&s;t of his <HI>Pythicks;</HI> and tho' I was unable to imitate him in any other Beauty, I re&s;olv'd to endeavour to Copy his Brevity, and take the Advantage of a Remark he has made in the la&s;t <HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> of the &s;ame Ode, which take in the Paraphra&s;e of <HI>Sudorius.</HI></P>
