<HEAD>DEDICATION. To GEORGE COLEMAN, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>AS one of the Town I con&s;ider my&s;elf your debtor, for the unexpected addition you have made to our dramatic entertainments. The Hay-Market hitherto has been con&s;idered merely as a little Summer Retreat, the proprietor of which never furni&s;hed more than a gla&s;s of wine and a &s;weatmeat, but you, Sir, like a wi&s;e ho&s;t, extend your plan, and be&s;ide, the light regale of Ari&s;tophanes and Fun, indulge your gue&s;ts with the rich banquet
<PB REF="3">of Shake&s;pear and &s;trong &s;en&s;e. But I have another motive for ad|dre&s;&s;ing the following little E&s;&s;ay to you, it is to beg pardon for at|tempting to analyze the perfor|mance of an actor, who&s;e merit was &s;ealed by the &s;anction of your patronage. I have the honour to be,</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE CHARACTER OF HAMLET.</HEAD>
<P>THE writings of Shake&s;pear have main|tained the po&s;t of eminence &s;o long, that mo&s;t people feign or po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome reli&s;h for them: his beauties have been acknowledged by every man of fine ta&s;te, and his ob&s;curities eluci|dated, by the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, elaborate, and learn|ed commentators this country has produced; to venture therefore upon the inve&s;tigation of a &s;ub|ject, apparently exhau&s;ted, might be as hazard|ous, as it &s;eems barren. But though it would be pre&s;umption in an arti&s;t, to de&s;ign the model of a temple, or a palace, after a ma&s;ter in architecture, it &s;urely cannot arraign his di&s;|cretion,
<PB N="2" REF="5">to fix on a &s;ingle column, and catch &s;ome minute beauty in the architrave or frieze, which may have e&s;caped a mind expanded to embrace a va&s;ter object.</P>
<P>The writer of this e&s;&s;ay, means to in&s;ulate the character of Hamlet, from the other per&s;ons of the drama; and after having con&s;idered the philo&s;ophic Prince, in regard to &s;ituation, temper, pa&s;&s;ions, and under&s;tanding, to ex|amine with coolne&s;s and impartiality, Mr. Hender&s;on's repre&s;entation of him; compare &s;hade, with &s;hade, and tint, with tint, then finally a&s;certain the degree of conception, and execution, that gentleman exhibited in his performance.</P>
<P>This &s;peices of critici&s;m has at lea&s;t novelty to recommend it; for though ta&s;te and learning dedicate every effort to e&s;tabli&s;h the reputation, and perpetuate the memory of the poet, the actor, to whom he is often indebted for more than one laurel, is rarely honored with a leaf, to protect him from oblivion. The graces of action, the harmony of elocution, and the energy of &s;oul which di&s;tingui&s;hes the favourite of the &s;i&s;ter mu&s;es purcha&s;e a tran&s;itory fame which peri&s;hes with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and had Gar|rick
<PB N="3" REF="6">no per&s;onal intere&s;t with Apollo, the &s;miles of Thalia, and the favor of Melpomene, would have been a precarious tenure on immortality.</P>
<P>The character of Hamlet, though not the mo&s;t fini&s;hed, is certainly one of the mo&s;t &s;plendid efforts of Shake&s;pear's genius. He has combined in it, every circum&s;tance which can affect the heart, or intere&s;t the under&s;tanding. He repre&s;ents a Prince, in the bloom of life, plunged into a deep melancholy, at the death of a father, whom he tenderly loved. The filial piety of a &s;on, is finely contra&s;ted by the levity of a mother, who in defiance of cen&s;ure, and the ties of con&s;anguinity, marries her decea&s;ed hu&s;band's brother.</P>
<Q><L>Ere yet the &s;alt of mo&s;t unrighteous tears,</L>
<L>Had left the flu&s;hing in her gauled eyes,</L></Q>
<P>Hamlet's under&s;tanding is &s;ound, and his &s;en&s;ibility exqui&s;ite. He is moreover adorned with every liberal accompli&s;hment, which can di&s;tingui&s;h the gentleman and the &s;cholar: his rea&s;onings are deep, and his pa&s;&s;ions ardent; and as both are excited by great and adequate motives, his character affords the mo&s;t ample field for the di&s;play of theatrical abilities. Such
<PB N="4" REF="7">is the contour of Hamlet, as delineated by Shake&s;pear, and which he has filled with as rich and glowing colours, as ever dropped from the pencil of imagination. The appearance of a young performer in a character of this importance, mu&s;t excite the curio&s;ity of every admirer of the drama. But in this &s;ickly win|ter, this blight of the &s;tage, when figure and voice, in general are the only &s;ub&s;titutes for feeling, conception, and imagination; it is no wonder, every dawn of tho&s;e fine faculties, is received with plea&s;ure, and fo&s;tered with ap|probation.</P>
<P>Mr. Hender&s;on, after having given infinite &s;atisfaction in the character of Shylock, ap|peared for the fir&s;t time in Hamlet. His &s;uc|ce&s;s mu&s;t have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations; he de&s;erved, and obtained great prai&s;e; but in ju&s;tice to his abilities, and in order to maintain the candour, and a&s;cert the dignity of ta&s;te, it is nece&s;&s;ary to examine with coolne&s;s, and preci&s;ion, his per|formance; and judging by the &s;tandards of nature and truth, pronounce where he merited cen&s;ure, and where approbation. It has often been conte&s;ted by theatrical polemicks, whether figure may not be di&s;pen&s;ed with in an
<PB N="5" REF="8">actor of real genius. It mu&s;t be allowed, that a man of &s;en&s;e and feeling, with a tolerable per|&s;on, will plea&s;e a judicious audience, much more than a blockhead, with beauty and grace; but in order to compleatly fill the idea, im|pre&s;&s;ed on the mind by the poet, every youth|ful per&s;onage, that &s;tands eminently forward in the drama, unle&s;s marked by record or tra|dition, with deformity, &s;hould certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e external requi&s;ites, which at &s;ight conci|liate re&s;pect and e&s;teem; they augment our in|tere&s;t in the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the character, and render &s;ympathy more exqui&s;ite. From the expre&s;s words of the poet, Hamlet &s;hould have the mo&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a&s;pect and demeanor.</P>
<Q><L>The courtier's, &s;oldier's &s;cholar's eye, tongue, &s;word,</L>
<L>Th' expectancy and ro&s;e of the fair &s;tate</L>
<L>The gla&s;s of fa&s;hion, and the mould of form</L></Q>
<P>And again,</P>
<Q>That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth</Q>
<P>Mr. Hender&s;on's per&s;on is far from &s;triking; it is rather under the middle &s;ize, and moulded with no extraordinary elegance, or &s;ymmetry. His eye is good, and all his other features, bold and marking; but his countenance &s;eemed
<PB N="6" REF="9">incapable of a&s;&s;uming the pathetic engaging look, which &s;hould peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h the character; his deportment was ea&s;y, but not graceful; and was con&s;iderably injured by his appearing over &s;olicitous about the di&s;po&s;al of his hands; it is particular, and ungraceful, to confine them too much to the bo&s;om. Mr. Hender&s;on's fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion therefore was not very favorable to him. But if he appeared inadequate to the character in a&s;pect, and de|portment, he &s;oon convinced his auditors, that he was not deficient in judgment and feeling. When the Queen charges Hamlet, almo&s;t in direct terms, with hypocri&s;y, per&s;evering in ob&s;tinate &s;orrow, for a lo&s;s which could not be retrieved, Mr. Hender&s;on delivered his pathetic reply with great &s;en&s;ibility; his look, tone, and ge&s;ture, were as well conceived, as exe|cuted, and finely marked the re&s;entment of a delicate, and liberal &s;pirit hurt by a reproach it was con&s;cious of not meriting. Excellence in &s;peaking a &s;oliloquy, is one of the greate&s;t difficulties in the art of acting. Nature is the only dictator in&s;pirited and impa&s;&s;ioned &s;cenes, moreover in dialogue, the eye of the &s;peaker is fixed by the per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed; but in tho&s;e cool deliberations which the mind holds with it&s;elf, when rea&s;on drops a curtain before the
<PB N="7" REF="10">eye of &s;en&s;e, and every external object is ex|cluded, it is then the genius of the actor is tried, for unle&s;s he has a &s;trong imagination to render him thoroughly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the character, united to a &s;ound judgment, and the happie&s;t powers of execution, his attention will unavoidably be &s;olicited by the audience, and render his words ridiculous and unnatural. Though we cannot pronounce Mr. Hender&s;on excellent in this department of the hi&s;trionic art, yet he was far from reprehen&s;ible; he appeared to want practice more than judgment, and a young actor &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his powers at once in full flexibility. When the mind is &s;trongly agitated, the body is re&s;tle&s;s and un&s;ettled&mdash;therefore Mr. Hender&s;on's walking to and fro during the time he waited to &s;ee his father's &s;pirit was extremely natural; however we mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreat him never in future to prepare us for a &s;tart by pulling off his hat immediately before the appearance of the gho&s;t; if he apprehends that appendage to dre&s;s may conceal the part of his face, where terror and anxiety are mo&s;t &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed, let him contrive to get rid of it in his fir&s;t confu|&s;ion; which if he cannot do with ea&s;e, let him remember, that in the fine arts, nothing is a beauty which militates with
<PB N="8" REF="11">nature and truth. In the &s;olemn addre&s;s to the Gho&s;t, Mr. Hender&s;on's voice was low, tre|mulous, and interrupted; ri&s;ing gradually to a more confirmed tone, as his fears &s;ub&s;ided; but his ejaculation to the protecting Angels of grace, was offered up before he &s;aw the &s;pirit; his &s;ucceeding pau&s;e was ju&s;t and natural; for terror incites an in&s;tantaneous wi&s;h for &s;afety; and it is always &s;ome time before the mind recovers it&s;elf enough to attend to any other object. There is a very capital blunder in the conduct of this &s;cene, of which mo&s;t Hamlets are guilty; when the &s;pirit appears, Horatio and Marcellus, in&s;tead of con&s;ulting their own &s;afeties, &s;eize Hamlet's arms; as if, from their prior acquaintance with the Gho&s;t, they were become familiar. This is not only ab&s;urd and unnatural, but robs the principal object of a picture&s;que and &s;triking attitude. Hamlet, when fir&s;t acquainted of the appari|tion, &s;eems to have a precognition that his fa|ther was come to reveal &s;ome important &s;ecret; for he &s;ays.</P>
<Q><L>I pray you all, if you have hitherto conceal'd this &s;ight</L>
<L>Let it be treble in your &s;ilence &s;till;</L>
<L>And what&s;oever &s;hall befall to night,</L>
<L>Give it an under&s;tanding, but no tongue.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
And from the following pa&s;&s;age, he appears determined, in &s;pite of oppo&s;ition, to interro|gate the &s;pirit, and know what &s;educed him from the bourne of eternity&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>If it a&s;&s;ume my noble father's per&s;on,</L>
<L>I'll &s;peak to it, tho' hell &s;hou'd gape</L>
<L>And bid me hold my peace.</L></Q>
<P>The apparition, in&s;tead of replying, continues to make repeated &s;ignals, as if he wi&s;hed to impart &s;omething to Hamlet alone.&mdash;He prepares to follow, but is held by his friends; it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that this check mu&s;t rather increa&s;e than dimini&s;h his anxiety; and by his own words he appears worked up to the mo&s;t extravagant pitch of de&s;peration &mdash;he declares that he does not value his life, that he thinks him&s;elf &s;ummoned by the voice of fate, and that he feels the pettie&s;t channel that throbs with life in his body as hardy as the Nemaean lion's nerve. Therefore during the &s;truggle to di&s;engage him&s;elf from Marcellus and Horatio, his look and ge&s;ture &s;hould be wild, and his voice piercingly ener|gic.&mdash;Mr. Hender&s;on fell infinitely &s;hort of this conception, either from want of viva|city of pa&s;&s;ion, or a deficiency of power in the upper tones of his voice; his painting was
<PB N="12" REF="13">ju&s;t, but not bold or ma&s;terly; from faintne&s;s of colouring the effect of light and &s;hade was incon&s;iderable, had he been more animated, the tran&s;ition from extremity of emotion to re&s;pect and duty, when he bids the gho&s;t proceed, would have had a prodigious fine effect.&mdash;Short as this &s;cene is, Garrick's ex|cellence in it was a&s;toni&s;hing; he pre&s;erved Shake&s;pear's fire undimini&s;hed, faithful as the electric, and &s;ent the animated &s;hock of na|ture's flame home to the heart.&mdash;It is to be regretted that a young performer of Mr. Hen|der&s;on's abilities can never behold this great model of Theatrical Perfection; for men of real genius profit from each other, without de&s;cending to the &s;ervility of imitation.&mdash; During the &s;ub&s;equent &s;cene with the Gho&s;t, Mr. Hender&s;on was every thing that critici&s;m could wi&s;h; but if he would ob&s;erve the mi|nutiae of propriety, he would drop his &s;word when the &s;pirit tells him that he is his father; hitherto he had but pre&s;umptive proofs.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that this is a piece of &s;tage etiquette, which may be complied or di&s;|pen&s;ed with AD LIBITUM; and perhaps it ne|ver would have been noticed by the writer of this e&s;&s;ay, but for the extraordinary ingenuity
<PB N="13" REF="14">of a news-paper Drawcan&s;ir, who mo&s;t &s;aga|ciou&s;ly remarked, in one of his daily critique's, that Hamlet's promi&s;ing to revenge his father's death after he had dropped his &s;word, was ab|&s;urd, judiciou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ing that he could not take it up again.</P>
<P>From the di&s;appearing of the Gho&s;t to the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t act, there are few opportuni|ties for the di&s;play of &s;uperior talents. Mr. Hender&s;on &s;poke the &s;oliloquy previous to the entry of Horatio and Marcellus, with great feeling and propriety, and pre&s;erved a beauty in this &s;peech which is either lo&s;t or rendered rediculous by the generality of performers; it is Hamlet's taking his tablets out, in order to &s;et down&mdash;</P>
<Q>That man may &s;mile, and &s;mile and be a villain.</Q>
<P>This is an action &s;trong emotion may dic|tate, but which nothing el&s;e can authorize. Therefore, if the actor be not animated, it will pa&s;s unnoticed, or appear like the flight of a lunatic. Mr. Hender&s;on felt, and nature &s;u&s;|tained no injury. At the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t act, Hamlet becomes a new character, de|termined on avenging the murder of his fa|ther, and ju&s;tly alarmed for his own &s;afety, he
<PB N="14" REF="15">a&s;&s;umes the ma&s;k of in&s;anity, to conceal his intentions, and lull the &s;u&s;picions of the king his uncle. There is no part of acting more difficult to exhibit, than that of madne&s;s. It requires great flexibility of voice, and counte|nance, to expre&s;s the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ima|ges, that float acro&s;s a di&s;tracted fancy. The eye &s;hould be wild, yet vacant, and the tones piercing. It is true, Hamlet's madne&s;s is feigned; but it is evident from the following lively de&s;cription, that the poet meant, it &s;hould be counterfeited with great &s;trength of imagination and ma&s;terly touches of nature.&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>My Lord as I was &s;ewing in my clo&s;et</L>
<L>Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced</L>
<L>No hat upon his head, his &s;tockings loo&s;e,</L>
<L>Ungartered, and down gyred to his ankle,</L>
<L>Pale as his &s;hirt, his knees knocking each other</L>
<L>And with a look &s;o piteous, in purport,</L>
<L>As if he had been loo&s;ed out of hell</L>
<L>To &s;peak of horrors, thus he comes, before me.</L></Q>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;cene with Polonius, Mr. Hen|der&s;on would have been unexceptionable, had he paid more regard to a &s;triking and pic|ture&s;que manner. He looked, and conceived the poet ju&s;tly, but dimini&s;hed the fine effect his di&s;ordered appearance would have had, by inattention to attitude and grace. There never
<PB N="15" REF="16">was perhaps a more admirable de&s;cription of a rooted melancholy, than the relation Ham|let gives to Ro&s;incraus and Guilden&s;tern, of the progre&s;s of his di&s;temper. It ri&s;es with &s;triking and noble images, in grand &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to an a&s;toni&s;hing pitch of &s;ublimity. The la&s;t objection made to Mr. Hender&s;on, &s;tands here al&s;o again&s;t him. His tones and manner had not the corre&s;pondent weight, which the maje&s;ty of the &s;entiments he uttered required. If he delivered this &s;peech le&s;s rapidly, and made a &s;hort pau&s;e previous to the words&mdash;
<Q>What a piece of work is man,</Q>
it would have had a much better effect. In his &s;cene with the players he was ea&s;y, &s;en&s;i|ble and &s;pirited; and gave the charge to them, as well, perhaps, as any man who ever per|formed the character.&mdash;It is painful to point out blemi&s;hes, where many beauties are to be met with. But the parterre will be &s;oon over-run, if the weeds are &s;uffered to remain, le&s;t the act of removing them &s;hould lacerate the flowers.&mdash; Hamlet is &s;tung with &s;hame, to &s;ee a player, by the force of imagination, deeply affected, for the calamities of a per&s;on who has been dead for centuries, and naturally a&s;ks, "what would &s;uch a man do, had he motives to &s;tir the cau&s;e of vengeance which he him&s;elf had.
<PB N="16" REF="17">In enumerating them, his pa&s;&s;ion kindles, till he becomes frantic with rage. Mr. Hender|&s;on wanted fire and rapidity. In rea&s;oning up|on the imagination of the player, and his own tardine&s;s to revenge, he was &s;triking and na|tural, but his indignation was not vented with the energy of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion. When the mind is &s;hook with violent anger, every &s;entence is uttered in the highe&s;t key of the voice. It is the native tone of rage, and if the performer cannot reach it, he comes tardy of the poet's conception. Mr. Hender&s;on never employs the upper key, which we are inclined to attri|bute to want of judgment rather than to want of genius. Rant con&s;i&s;ts in the mi&s;application, not in the great exertion of the voice. For in the impa&s;&s;ioned part of this &s;peech, every word Mr. Garrick utters, &s;eems to ru&s;h from the burning mint of &s;en&s;ibility; which proves, that the loude&s;t extent of voice will not offend, when the heart replies to it in &s;ympathy. Mr. Hender&s;on laid a glaring fal&s;e empha&s;is in this &s;peech. In repeating
<Q><L>What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</L>
<L>That he &s;hould weep for her?</L></Q>
he puts the &s;tre&s;s upon HER, though there is no antithe&s;is. Hamlet is not &s;urpri&s;ed at the
<PB N="17" REF="18">player's weeping for Hecuba in PARTICU|LAR, but that he &s;hou'd weep for any per|&s;on, with whom he was utterly unconnected; if this pa&s;&s;age be received as Mr. Hender&s;on &s;poke it, one would be apt to conclude, that there was &s;omething in the mi&s;eries of Hecuba, which excluded her from compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The third act opens with the celebrated &s;o|liloquy upon &s;uicide. Hamlet, weary of be|ing obliged to procra&s;tinate his revenge, and &s;ick of the calamities of life, from which he &s;aw no rank or condition to be exempted, reflects which &s;hould be preferred in adver&s;ity, exi&s;tence or death <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warburton, in his comment upon this &s;oliloquy from a happy facility, he often di&s;plays of &s;ophi&s;ticating the &s;en&s;e of the cleare&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, gives a &s;trange turn to Shake&s;pear's meaning. He interprets to be or not to be, am I to exi&s;t hereafter or not? Hamlet at fir&s;t ap|pears &s;atisfied that he would not, for he a&s;ks, is it nobler to endure calamity or end it by death? This leads him to con&s;ider the nature of death, which he concludes to be a &s;leep, a privation from feeling, a tomb in which life and &s;ufferance were both buried. He afterward hazards a conjecture that there may be dreams in this &s;leep, and that the dread of them mu&s;t certainly prevent the wretch|ed putting a period to their exi&s;tence. But there is one circum&s;tance which has e&s;caped the learned commenta|tor, why &s;hould Hamlet doubt the &s;eparate exi&s;tence of the &s;oul after having &s;een and conver&s;ed with his father's &s;pirit? John&s;on remarks upon this &s;peech that the prince enumerate evils to which the lower orders of life only were &s;ubject. But Hamlet does not adduce them as cau&s;es for his own di&s;gu&s;t with the world. They are merely the ob&s;ervations of a &s;peculative mind touched with the mi&s;eries of human nature.</NOTE> the magnitude of this &s;ubject gives
<PB N="18" REF="19">great &s;cope to an actor of genius. Mr. Hender&s;on appeared in every re&s;pect equal to it; his words and action &s;eemed to flow from deep and &s;trong thinking; and both were regulated by the &s;tricte&s;t rules of ta&s;te and judgment. Hamlet's meditations are interrupted by the pre&s;ence of Ophelia. He addre&s;&s;es her at fir&s;t, with gen|tlene&s;s and delicacy. But recollecting the cha|racter he had to &s;u&s;tain, he &s;tarts wildly from the point, and under the &s;helter of frenzy, vents the keene&s;t &s;atyr again&s;t the &s;ex in gene|ral. Here Mr. Hender&s;on was too tame. He &s;hould remember, that though there be truth, and &s;trong &s;en&s;e in what he &s;ays, that he is &s;till the mad-man; and that unle&s;s his look and manner be wild, and his utterance rapid, he will be di&s;covered. No actor will perform this &s;cene well, without a fine imagination, to catch the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the poet; and out of love to the expiring genius of the &s;tage, we hope Mr. Hender&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it. It would be tedious
<PB N="19" REF="20">and unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell upon pa&s;&s;ages which any performer of good &s;en&s;e may execute with|out incurring cen&s;ure, or extorting applau&s;e. We &s;hall confine our ob&s;ervations to tho&s;e parts alone where excellence may be di&s;played. From the king's confu&s;ion at the murder of Gonzago, Hamlet is convinced of his guilt. His doubts therefore are removed, re&s;pecting the veracity of the gho&s;t, and he determines upon revenge the fir&s;t opportunity. Upon find|ing the king at prayers, he is about to put him to death; but recollecting that it was not in the moment of contrition, he killed his father, that he took him, full of bread,
<Q>With all his crimes, broad blown, as flu&s;h as May.</Q>
he re&s;olves to defer his vengeance to the un|prepared hour of plea&s;ure and debauch. This principal link, being omitted in the repre&s;en|tation, and no other cau&s;e &s;ub&s;tituted, for Hamlet's continuing to procra&s;tinate, he ap|pears 'weak and incon&s;i&s;tent, during the la&s;t two acts. At the private interview Ham|let has with his mother, Mr. Hender&s;on was rather too boi&s;terous and irreverent to a queen and his parent. A liberal mind will pre&s;erve delicacy, even in reproaches. In &s;peaking,
<Q><PB N="20" REF="21">
<L>You are the queen, your hu&s;band's, brother's wife,</L>
<L>Wou'd it were not &s;o; you are my mother,</L></Q>
he pau&s;es after the words, "Your hu&s;band's, brother's wife," and by uttering the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;age in one continued tone, perverts the &s;en&s;e, appearing to de&s;ire, that the queen was not his mother, when the poet means he &s;hould wi&s;h, that &s;he was not married to his uncle. This interpretation of the pa&s;&s;age is &s;anctified, not only by Hamlet's general character, but by his own words. Notwith&s;tanding the in|continence of his mother, he con&s;tantly be|trays the tenderne&s;s of a &s;on, and feels for her weakne&s;s as a woman.</P>
<Q><L>O heart, lo&s;e not thy nature; let not ever</L>
<L>The &s;oul of Nero enter this firm bo&s;om;</L>
<L>Let me be cruel, but not unnatural,</L>
<L>'Twill &s;peak daggers to her, but u&s;e none.</L></Q>
<P>Hamlet's producing the picture of his father and his uncle, is a happy and affecting inci|dent; but we think Mr. Hender&s;on's concep|tion, in one part of it, erroneous. When the pious prince dwells upon the per&s;onal beauty of his father, and contra&s;ts it with the defor|mity of his uncle, admiration, not grief, is the
<PB N="21" REF="22">predominant pa&s;&s;ion; &s;orrow chills the fancy, and the following images appear to be the offspring of the mo&s;t glowing imagination.&mdash;
<Q><L>An eye, like Mars, to threaten or command,</L>
<L>A &s;tation like the herald Mercury;</L>
<L>New lighted on a heaven-ki&s;&s;ing hill,</L>
<L>A combination, and a form indeed;</L>
<L>Where ev'ry God had &s;et his &s;eal,</L>
<L>To give the world a&s;&s;urance of a man.</L></Q>
Imagery rich as this, requires a firm animated tone of grandeur. But Mr. Hender&s;on's voice broke into a boyi&s;h whimper, which not a &s;yl|lable he had to utter could ju&s;tify, or dictate. Throwing away the king's picture, &s;avours ra|ther of trick; be&s;ides it does not &s;eem to aug|ment our &s;en&s;ibility. Mr. Hender&s;on's terror was finely expre&s;&s;ed upon the appearance of the gho&s;t; his voice, countenance and attitude, con&s;prired with united force to &s;trike us with awe, pity, and admiration; and if he would avoid the errors hinted at, his clo&s;et &s;cene would be a mo&s;t capital piece of acting.&mdash;One of the principal defects in this tragedy, is the almo&s;t total exclu&s;ion of Hamlet from the fourth act; &s;o long lo&s;ing &s;ight of the chief per&s;onage in the drama, our intere&s;t for him is dimini&s;hed: as the piece was originally written, Hamlet has
<PB N="22" REF="23">three &s;cenes in the fourth act, but two of which are retained, though the third con|tains a mo&s;t beautiful &s;oliloquy, in which Hamlet ju&s;tifies him&s;elf, for &s;u&s;pending the revenge he promi&s;ed his father. In Mr. Gar|rick's alteration this &s;peech is pre&s;erved. The opening of the fifth act is &s;tained with low ri|baldry, but &s;o intimately connected with &s;tri|king beauties, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to expunge the one without lo&s;ing the other. Hamlet's reflections upon the la&s;t humiliating &s;tate of human nature, are awful and affecting, particularly tho&s;e upon the &s;kull of Yorick, when he beholds the &s;ad disfigured remains, of a man who was once dear to him, mouldring into du&s;t, hideous with deformity, the food and habitation of the worm; but the genius of Shake&s;pear penetrated all nature, and his voice is heard from the tomb. We were &s;urprized and chagrined, to find Mr. Hender&s;on fell &s;hort of our expectations in this &s;cene. His expre&s;&s;ion was languid and unimpa&s;&s;ioned. He appeared over &s;olicitous to give force and &s;o|lemnity to his manner, and in the attempt lo&s;t the fine &s;pirit of the poet. In uttering the rant into which Hamlet breaks at Ophelia's fune|ral, Mr. Hender&s;on di&s;torts the &s;en&s;e of one line by a fal&s;e empha&s;is. Laertes, when his
<PB N="23" REF="24">&s;i&s;ter's ob&s;equies are nearly fini&s;hed, overcome with &s;orrow, leaps into her grave, and cries,
<Q>Now heap your mountains on the quick and dead,</Q>
de&s;iring, in the extravagance of grief, to be interred alive with one &s;o dear to him. Ham|let, who&s;e affection for Ophelia was not le&s;s ardent, challenges him to give a proof of &s;u|perior tenderne&s;s, and after propo&s;ing the wilde&s;t te&s;ts which frenzy could dictate, &s;ays,
<Q>BE buried quick with her and &s;o will I.</Q>
As this was a propo&s;al of Laertes, not Ham|let, the emphatical word undoubtedly is the mono&s;ylable BE. Mr. Hender&s;on does not ob&s;erve this empha&s;is, therefore from his tone we would conclude that Laertes had not, pri|or to Hamlet, de&s;ired to be interred with O|phelia, but that this thought was originally the latter's, and only in the climas of extrava|gant images which bur&s;t from him in the ef|ferve&s;cence of imagination. When O&s;trick cries a hit, a palpable hit; Laertes' point is at Hamlet's brea&s;t, owing to Mr. Hender&s;on's ignorance of the &s;word. Fencing is an ac|compli&s;hment, not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with in an actor; and nothing &s;o much promotes grace|fulne&s;s
<PB N="24" REF="25">of deportment. Mr. Hender&s;on's dy|ing &s;cene was capital, it appeared indeed the la&s;t &s;truggle of the &s;pirit, when life hangs quivering to a point, and death extingui&s;hes it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Having thus progre&s;&s;ively traced Mr. Hender&s;on through the character of Hamlet, and remarked with equal candour upon his merits and imperfections; we mu&s;t pronounce him, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome blemi&s;hes, the be&s;t performer now left to &s;upport the drooping trophies of the &s;tage. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ta&s;te, feel|ing and good &s;en&s;e; and though not ble&s;&s;ed by nature with that portion of aetherial fire, which alone could once purcha&s;e him emi|nence on the &s;tage, he mu&s;t always main|tain the &s;uperiority of men, who in general are indebted to accident, per&s;on, or intere&s;t, for their &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Is it not ridiculous and di&s;gu&s;ting to hear a man without an atom of feeling draul out in one uniform, unvaried tone, the mo&s;t point|ed ob&s;ervation or lively pa&s;&s;ion? Is it not mon&s;trous to behold another with the &s;epul|chral a&s;pect of an undertaker, and a voice as di&s;mal as the hooting of the owl warbling out
<PB N="25" REF="26">Romeo, and putting Shake&s;pear to death? But what is infinitely, if po&s;&s;ible, more pre|po&s;terous, we are &s;ometimes obliged to bear a man, who&s;e enormous bulk and drou&s;y eye would incline us to believe, that he had bet|ter ta&s;te in Calipa&s;h and Calipee, than in de|licacy of &s;entiment, and re&s;embles an alderman or a butcher more than a lover or a hero <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This GREAT man, who for &s;ome time added con&s;iderable WEIGHT to the Edinburgh &s;tage, was one night to doze thro' a capital character, in which he expected to infu&s;e more of the poppy than u&s;ual; but a wag who was &s;en&s;ible that no man contributed &s;o much as him&s;elf to the repo&s;e of an audience, politely in&s;erted at the bottom of the bills: N. B. Gentlemen are reque&s;ted to bring night-cape.</NOTE> For heaven's &s;ake, does a manager ever purcha&s;e actors by the pound, tha he will employ &s;uch people? We congratulate the public upon their acqui&s;ition in Mr. Hender&s;on, and hope his genius will protect us at lea&s;t in part from like mortifications in future.</P>
