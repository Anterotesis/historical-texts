<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS all Evils are to be di&s;covered be|fore we can expect their Remedy, this Work proceeds in that Order.</P>
<P>We &s;hall never attempt the re&s;toring our Manufactures, if we do not fir&s;t en|quire into the Cau&s;es of their Decay.</P>
<P>The following Work does not complain of the Evil with Reproach, and to expo&s;e the Indolence of the Age, whatever Room there might have been for &s;uch a Satyr.</P>
<P>But &s;eriou&s;ly repre&s;ents the Grievance, and earne&s;tly moves our Superiors to ap|ply the proper Remedies.</P>
<P>It is not the War, it is not the Ingra|titude of This Power, or the Inveteracy of That, which can hurt the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu|factures, at lea&s;t not fatally.</P>
<P>Our Mi&s;chiefs are at Home, and the Remedy is at Home: We may cure the Evil with the utmo&s;t Ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
But if we will be <HI>Felo de &s;e</HI> in Trade, if we will cut the Throat of our own Ma|nufactures, if we will pull them down with our own Hands, we &s;hould have our Trade Buried at a Cro&s;s-way, with a Stake dri|ven thro' it, and an In&s;cription, <HI>Here lies Buried the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Trade, having de|&s;troy'd it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>This Tract regards no Faction or Parties; no Complaint again&s;t publick or private Per|&s;ons or Management; but 'tis a Complaint of an unhappy Humour among us all, that we will Di&s;courage and De&s;troy our own Manufactures, and ruin our &s;elves.</P>
<P>May the National Wi&s;dom re&s;train this Folly; may the Poor obtain &s;uch Help, and Trade &s;uch Relief, as the Di&s;tre&s;s of our Com|merce and People call for, and the End of this Work, and the Author's Wi&s;h, will be fully An&s;wered.</P>

AN ACCOUNT of the <HI>Pre&s;ent Condition</HI> of the MANUFACTURES of GREAT BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter into the Sub&s;tance of the Que&s;tion now before me, and that I may make as little Pream|ble as po&s;&s;ible in a Thing of &s;uch Importance, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to lay down in plain and direct Terms, &s;o as may admit of no Cavils or Di&s;putes, what I mean, and how I would be under&s;tood by the Words, <HI>The Manufactures of Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>By the Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain</HI> (and of which I &s;ug|ge&s;t, that they are now in a declining and decaying Condition) I mean the Woollen Manufactures, &s;uch as Broad and Narrow Cloths, Serges, Ker&s;ies, Druggets, Bays, Sayes, Perpets, Stuffs, Stockings, Hats, Flannels, and all tho&s;e woollen Goods generally u&s;ed for Wearing-Apparel, Furniture of Hou&s;es, and &s;uch-like nece&s;&s;ary Purpo&s;es; and as are made by the Labour of our People, for U&s;e or Sale at Home (that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Great Britain</HI>) or for Exportation Abroad, of what|ever Kind, and by whatever Names; for they bear &s;o great a Variety of Names (e&s;pecially the <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> Goods) that it would be as endle&s;s as it is needle&s;s to enter in|to the Particulars.</P>
<P>That this Manufacture is a thing of great Importance, of a va&s;t Magnitude, and a Value beyond all po&s;&s;ible Calculation, I &s;uppo&s;e I need not &s;pend time to prove; 'tis de&s;crib'd in the be&s;t manner to be under&s;tood, by taking Notice, that it not only u&s;es and works up all the Wool which grows in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but a very great Quantity both from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Ireland, Barbary, Turkey,</HI> and other Places where-ever it can be had, and of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to take notice again in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">
That this Manufacture was once in a flouri&s;hing Condi|tion, va&s;tly extended abroad, and prodigiou&s;ly con&s;um'd at home; was carried on to the Employment and Enriching of innumerable Multitudes of People, and Families of People, 'till it had made <HI>England</HI> (where its Center is fix'd) the mo&s;t opulent, populous, wealthy, and powerful Nation in the World; all this I not acknowledge only, but if it &s;hould be di&s;puted, am ready to make appear at large upon all Occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e evident, that this flouri&s;hing Manufacture has ri&s;en from &s;mall Beginnings, and was at fir&s;t re&s;cued (as it were) out of Captivity in a &s;trange Land, where (like <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI>) it &s;uffer'd Bondage, and was engro&s;s'd by Foreign|ers who had no Title to it, having none of its Principles, no Materials for carrying it on <HI>De Jure,</HI> in their own Right, no, nor <HI>De Facto,</HI> in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but &s;erch'd them from us, and then arbitrarily &s;old back the Goods made of them to us at their own Price, enriching their People with the Profits of the Manufacture, while (<HI>Spaniard-</HI>like) we &s;tarv'd with the Mines of Gold in our own keeping.</P>
<P>From this Captive-State, this mi&s;erable abandon'd Condi|tion, it was re&s;cued, by the Policy and Wi&s;dom of our Go|vernment, and the impolitick and fooli&s;h Management of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who by their Religious Tyranny, and their Civil Fury, drove their own People over to us to &s;eek Bread and Liberty, in return for which they gave us Wealth and Trade, taught our Women to Spin, and our Men to Weave; ever &s;ince this we have made the Manufacture our own, and are now able to teach our Teachers, having infinitely improv'd the Kinds, as well as encreas'd the Quantity; have made not only innumerable new-invented Sorts, but have al&s;o made tho&s;e Sorts or Kinds of Goods much better than ever the <HI>Flemmings</HI> were able to make them before, e&s;pecially the Broad Cloths, which are improved to &s;uch a Degree, and brought to &s;uch Per|fection, as they were never capable of before, or &s;o much as to believe po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>That by this very Article, <HI>England,</HI> tho' not an Inch of Land larger, either in Length or Breadth, the Soil not an Ounce richer than it was capable of being made before, the Climate not one Degree warmer, and without any one Advantage of Nature, more than it had before; yet by a moderate, and I be|lieve a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Calculation, between the Year 1490, in the beginning of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. when we began to manufacture our own Wool, and the Year 1726, has encreas'd her People from under two Millions, to above &s;even Millions,
<PB N="3" REF="8">
rai&s;ed the Value of Lands &s;o, that what was then worth <HI>50l. per Annum,</HI> is now worth <HI>1000l. per Annum,</HI> as may be &s;een by the Rate of Sub&s;idies, and by other Rules of Calcu|lation, and which has rai&s;ed the Value of Per&s;onal Wealth to &s;uch a Degree, as admits no Compari&s;on, no Calculation, and hardly any Imagination; in&s;omuch that Some are of opinion, that taking the Wealth of this Nation at the Medium of Time, between the Conque&s;t, and the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that is to &s;ay, about the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> II. and excepting only the Wealth of Churches and Mona&s;terys, which indeed was great, there is now more Silver in <HI>England</HI> than there was then Block Tin, more Gold than they had Copper, and more Dia|monds and Pearl than they had <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Stones.</P>
<P>This Increa&s;e of People, and of the Real and Per&s;onal Wealth of <HI>England,</HI> may be &s;aid to be all owing to the Wool|len Manufacture; and to bring it all to the Point, <HI>viz.</HI> that this Woollen Manufacture has gone on encrea&s;ing ever &s;ince, even to this Time, or (as I may more properly &s;ay) to Our time, 'till its Magnitude is &s;uch, that we may &s;ay it is too great, and that not too great for the Country only, but too great for the whole World.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange Advance made in this Argument, and at the be|ginning of it too, to &s;ay the Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> is too great for the World; but I cannot go back from it; and upon a &s;erious Reflexion on its real Magnitude, as it now is; and yet how much greater it is po&s;&s;ible to make it, that is to &s;ay, how many Countries, and, as I may &s;ay, Millions of People are yet unconcerned in it, and unemployed by it, I do in&s;i&s;t, that were the Wool of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> kept entire|ly at home, the Quantity encreas'd as it might be, and all that Quantity manufactured at home, as it al&s;o might be, if tho&s;e other Countries were &s;et to work, the People of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> are able to make more Woollen Manufactures than all the known Inhabitants of the World would wear; To &s;uch a Perfection of Working are the People arrived; to &s;uch an immen&s;e Quantity is the Wool brought to amount, to &s;uch a prodigious Number are the People multiplied; and the la&s;t Article indeed is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all the re&s;t, for not with&s;tanding the Encrea&s;e of the Wool, which is a Prodi|gy in it &s;elf, yet to &s;uch a Degree are the People al&s;o encreas'd, that all the Wool of <HI>England,</HI> however (as I &s;ay) encreas'd, and all the Wool of <HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence no Wool was had in tho&s;e Days, and all the Wool of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was not u&s;ed at all in <HI>England</HI> in tho&s;e times, is now manufactured in <HI>England,</HI> by le&s;s than one quarter part of our People.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="9">
This may &s;eem &s;trange at fir&s;t View, and e&s;pecially when we &s;ee how many Thou&s;ands, nay, how many Millions of People are employ'd in this one Manufacture. But let me be allowed a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion, and I &s;hall &s;oon prove it by giving you a View of the &s;everal Countries in <HI>England,</HI> where the Woollen Manufactures are made, and where <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>N.B. <HI>Before I begin, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when I &s;ay, &s;uch Counties make no Woollen Manufactures, I do not mean that many of the People might not knit their own Stockings, &s;pin and weave Woollens for their own U&s;e and Wearing, as in &s;ome Places they do Linnen, where yet we do not &s;ay the Linnen is carried on as a Manufacture; but it is to be under&s;tood that they make no Particular or General Manufacture for Sale, and for Trade, to be carried out of the Bounds of the Towns or Counties where they are &s;o made.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The County of <HI>Cornwall</HI> is not known to have any Ma|nufacture. <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> indeed, the next County immediately on this Side, is full of Manufacture; but we &s;ee nothing in <HI>Cornwall</HI> but Miners, and Diggers in the Earth for Lead, Copper, and Block Tin; as for the poor Women, they are employ'd in wa&s;hing the Oar; and the Men who are not at work in the Mines are Refiners, Smelters, and Melters of the Oar and Mettals, or el&s;e are Husbandmen, Fi&s;hermen and Sailers; but no Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P N="2">2. The four large Counties of <HI>Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, Surry,</HI> and <HI>Southampton,</HI> have very little apparent Manufacture. In former times there were &s;ome Cloathings about <HI>Guildford, Godlaming, Darking,</HI> and <HI>Farnham</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and likewi&s;e at <HI>Tenterden, Cranbrook, Goudbur&s;t,</HI> and in the <HI>Wild</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> in both which Counties they made a very good (tho' low-priz'd) Medley Cloth for the middling Peoples wear, but 'tis all gone, extinct, except a little not worth naming.</P>
<P N="3">3. The great City of <HI>London</HI> is now eminent for the Wool|len Manufacture of Stuffs, Chamlets, and &s;everal Goods, &s;uch as were formerly made at <HI>Norwich;</HI> but as this is in a manner confin'd to <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> and a few adjacent Streets, and to a very little in <HI>Southwark,</HI> it may be truly &s;aid, that not one twentieth Part of the City and County of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> are concerned at all in it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Inland Counties of <HI>Bucks, Hert&s;ord, Cambridge, Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon;</HI> the&s;e have none of them any Wool|len Manufactures, except that of late Years the <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> Manufacturers have employed &s;ome particular Places in
<PB N="5" REF="10">
tho&s;e Counties for &s;pinning Wor&s;ted Yarn, but 'tis &s;ent up to <HI>London</HI> to be manufactured.</P>
<P N="5">5. Even <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> it &s;elf, tho' it is the inexhau&s;tible Fund of Wool for all the Ea&s;t and South-Ea&s;t Part of <HI>England,</HI> and is the chief Support of their Manufacture, yet has no Manufa|cture of its own, nor do we &s;o much as &s;ee the Women and Children employ'd, or any Spinning among them; tho' it is al|&s;o an exceeding large and populous County; but they are ge|nerally employ'd in Trade or Husbandry at home, or upon the Seas abroad.</P>
<P N="6">6. The County of <HI>Stafford,</HI> and of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Darby,</HI> be|ing wholly taken up in making Chee&s;e, breeding Hor&s;es and Cows, digging Lead, and making Crockery Ware, have very little or no Woollen Manufacture, except about <HI>Tamworth.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham,</HI> and the Ea&s;t and North Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> are the &s;ame, and have no Woollen Manufacture, except a &s;mall Quantity of Yarn Stockings made at <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Barnard Ca&s;tle,</HI> and a ccar&s;e &s;trip'd Stuff for Hangings at <HI>Darlington.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. All the Counties of <HI>Wales</HI> put together, produce no Manufacture for Sale, or that come out of their own bounds, except Flannel, with a very few and very coar&s;e Yarn Stockings.</P>
<P N="9">9. Nor do the two large Counties of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Here|ford,</HI> and two Thirds of <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> &s;o much as pretend to any Woollen Manufacture, but are taken up with planting Or|chards, making Syder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>So that notwith&s;tanding the exceeding Greatne&s;s and Ex|tent of the Woollen Manufacture, and that (as I have &s;aid) it &s;eems to be too great, even for the whole World, yet it employs by far the lea&s;t Part of <HI>England,</HI> and even the lea&s;t Part of the People in many of tho&s;e Counties where it is made.</P>
<P>Nay, even in tho&s;e Counties where great Branches of the Woollen Manufacture are e&s;tabli&s;hed, yet there are other Manufactures which employ greater numbers of their People: For Example,</P>
<P>The four Capital Di&s;tricts where the Woollen Manufa|cture of <HI>England</HI> is &s;eated, are thus divided:</P>
<P N="1">1. The We&s;t-riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> including the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> the County of <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI> and <HI>Richmond&s;hire,</HI> and Part of <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>Yet in this very We&s;t-riding is the great Iron Manufacture of <HI>Sheffield;</HI> and the County round it, which is called <HI>Hallam|&s;hire,</HI> is &s;aid to employ at lea&s;t an hundred thou&s;and People.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="11">
2. The We&s;t Side of <HI>Wilts,</HI> and the whole Counties of <HI>Glouce&s;ter, Warwick&s;bire,</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and part of <HI>Shrop|&s;hire;</HI> and yet in the two Counties of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> are carried on the great Hard-ware Manufacture of Iron, Bra&s;s, Steel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at <HI>Birmingham,</HI> and the Nailors which it is known to employ are a prodigious Number of People, ma|ny more than at <HI>Sheffield;</HI> as al&s;o, the Manufacture of Gla&s;s at <HI>Sturbridge,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;maller Manufactures al|&s;o of different kinds; add to which, the multitude of Dairies and Chee&s;e-makers in tho&s;e particular Counties.</P>
<P N="3">3. The great and populous Counties of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Somer|&s;et,</HI> the mo&s;t intent perhaps upon the Woollen Manufacture of any in all <HI>Britain,</HI> yet how is the fir&s;t diverted by the fi&s;h|ing Trade upon both its Shores, its Cyder Trade in the <HI>South-Hams,</HI> and al&s;o in their Sea-affairs as well the Ship|ping as the Merchandize; and the other in Grazing and Dig|ging of Lead and Coal, which employs many thou&s;ands of their People.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Counties of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Norfolk,</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> carry on the fourth, but not the lea&s;t Branch of the Woollen Manufacture, and yet they tell us there are above thirty thou&s;and Men em|ployed out of tho&s;e three Counties always at Sea. <HI>Suffolk</HI> is two Thirds of it, both Land and People, employed in Dairies and feeding Cattle and Fowls for <HI>London;</HI> and they tell us, that the two Counties of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> only, &s;end every Year to <HI>London</HI> fifty thou&s;and Head of fat black Cattle, two hun|dred thou&s;and fat Sheep and Lambs, fifty thou&s;and Firkins of Butter, and twenty thou&s;and Barrels of Oy&s;ters, an hundred thou&s;and fatted Calves, with two Millions of Gee&s;e and Turkeys. How many of the People all That may keep em|ployed, let others judge for me: However it will be granted that even in the&s;e three Counties where &s;uch prodigious Ma|nufactures are produced, as <HI>Norwich</HI> Stuffs, the <HI>Sudbury</HI> Sayes and the <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Bayes, yet not one half of the People are employed in any.</P>
<P>Add to this, the Multitudes of People in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> em|ployed in making the Cotton Manufactures, about which alone they &s;ay there are two hundred thou&s;and People employed in the Town of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and within twelve Miles round it.</P>
<P>Add to this al&s;o, the Multitudes now employed in the &s;ame County in the Linnen Manufacture, which is &s;o encrea&s;ed of late Years there as to employ near as many as the Cotton, only that it extends over a greater compa&s;s of Land.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">
Add to them all, That even in tho&s;e Manufacturing Coun|ties, where the greate&s;t Part of the Woollen Work is carried on, and where the mo&s;t People are employed by it, not the Lawyers, not the Phy&s;icians, not the Gentry, not the Cler|gy, not the Citizens, or Towns-people, that is to &s;ay, not the Shop-keepers, not all the Handicrafts, &s;uch as Smiths, Carpenters, Ma&s;ous, Bricklayers, Shoemakers, and of the la&s;t, not their Wives or Children, &s;o much as &s;et a Hand, no not a Finger, to any Part of this great Manufacture, except it be to wear it out and con&s;ume it.</P>
<P>In a word, except the Weaving part, and the Managing part, the main Stre&s;s of the Manufacture depends upon, and is performed by the Women and Children, and that of tho&s;e few Counties only.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion from all this is directly to the Ca&s;e pro|po&s;ed, thus:</P>
<P>If the Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> is &s;o prodigious great, and yet employs but &s;o &s;mall a Part of the People, what might it not be brought to, and how would it be (as I &s;aid) too great for the whole World, if all the Inhabitants, I mean all the loo&s;er In|habitants, &s;uch as are fit to work, and who would gladly work if they could be employed, were &s;et in upon it? What an infinite Quantity of Goods would they make, and how would they u&s;e up, not only all the Wool that <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> could produce, but even more Wool than they could produce, tho' the &s;aid Quantity was to be encrea&s;ed to twice or three times as much as it is, and that none was clande&s;tinely carried away to other Parts?</P>
<P>But as I &s;aid this Part &s;hould be treated as a Digre&s;&s;ion, I will not run it out too long. It comes of cour&s;e next to con&s;ider the pre&s;ent State of this great Manufacture, how it &s;tands, and then bring it all to the&s;e great and nece&s;&s;ary En|quiries.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether it is under a declining and &s;inking Condition, or no?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What Effect this Decay of the Manufacture may have, and what it naturally tends to?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What are the Occa&s;ions of its Decay, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. What may yet be done to revive it? With &s;ome other Ob&s;ervations which may fall in as we go.</ITEM>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the original State of the Woollen Manufacture of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with &s;ome ju&s;t Deductions from what it has been in former Times to what it is Now.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have ob&s;erved in the Introduction that the Woollen Manufacture was (like the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) re&s;cued from a State of Captivity, and from a &s;trange Land, we mu&s;t make that out a little plainer: The Ca&s;e was thus.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. of glorious Fame, tho' <HI>Eng|land</HI> was thought to be at that time in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Condition that Hi&s;tory gives us any Account of: The Glory of her Arms, the Vigour of the Monarch, and of his elde&s;t Son, the Gaiety and Splendor of the Court were &s;uch as never were known before; the La&s;t was the Re&s;ort of all the No|bility, Youth and Gentry of <HI>Europe;</HI> the &s;econd was the Ad|miration and Wonder of the World; the greate&s;t Princes made their Court to them, and Kings were Captives in their Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion: <HI>England</HI> was the Terror of the World; The Bat|tles of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y</HI> and <HI>Poictiers,</HI> and the re|in&s;tating the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> depos'd by his Rival, were Actions that brought all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to &s;tand at Gaze, and as it were to dread the turning of the Arms of <HI>England</HI> &s;o much as to|wards their Dominions: Hi&s;tory will confirm all the Particu|lars; I have no room for long Quotations:</P>
<P>Yet all this while Trade &s;hared no Advantages among the Conque&s;ts of the Day; nor do we find the lea&s;t Concern in any of the Councils of that Glorious Prince, or of his Mini|&s;ters of State, for the Propagation of Commerce, at home or abroad.</P>
<P>Building publick and &s;umptuous Edifices, great Churches and Mona&s;terys; making Fea&s;ts, Balls, Tournaments; adorn|ing <HI>Wind&s;or-</HI>Ca&s;tle; in&s;tituting the famous Order of Knight|hood; making League, and Alliances; expen&s;ive Enterviews with Foreign Princes, &s;uch as the Emperor and the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and keeping a magnificent <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court at <HI>Co|logne,</HI> for almo&s;t a Year and a half at a time: The&s;e things took up the Court, and turn'd the Eyes (I had almo&s;t &s;aid turn'd the Heads) of the Nation, during that whole Reign. Things which tended to the Glory of the Kingdom, and the Honour of the Maje&s;ty of the King, as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> &s;aid of his great <HI>Babel</HI> that he had built; but, as we may add, the&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="14">
glorious things gutted <HI>England</HI> of its Wealth, made the Mo|narch powerful and his People poor.</P>
<P>In all his Parliaments we &s;ee not one Act for the En|couragement of Trade, for the enlarging Commerce, for Em|ployment of the Poor, for &s;etting up Manufactures; to &s;peak the Truth, I que&s;tion if the Word Manufacture or Manufa|cturer were known in the Country; and, for ought I &s;ee, as the Taylors were the Only Merchants, &s;o the Shoemakers were the Greate&s;t Manufacturers in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The bountiful Hand of Heaven had then, and from the Be|ginning, given <HI>England</HI> the greate&s;t Gift of Nature that the whole World could be &s;aid to enjoy, <HI>viz.</HI> the Wool: The diligent and &s;en&s;ible Nations round us under&s;tood it, and how to value it; and, which was more, under&s;tood how to improve it; and for that end, throng'd to the very outmo&s;t Bounds of the Continent of <HI>Europe</HI> (this way) to be near it, and that they might bring it over as cheap as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>By this I mean the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> where the indu&s;trious Peo|ple, by the Help of the Wool from <HI>England,</HI> fell to work in &s;uch a Manner as that there they made then, as we have &s;ince done in <HI>England,</HI> Cloaths for all the known Parts of the World.</P>
<P>This brought the many Thou&s;ands and Millions of People to inhabit tho&s;e drowned, overflowed Bogs and Mar&s;hes, which before that were &s;carce thought fit for human Crea|tures to dwell in, and which were dwelt in only as Retreats and Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es to &s;ecure the fugitive Nations from the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> and afterwards of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>This very Trade brought People, and built Cities and Ca|&s;tles, even where the Sea allowed no footing, and the Land no Foundation; from hence, I &s;ay, the numberle&s;s Throngs of People came to dwell in that Country, and by degrees, by the Encrea&s;e of their Wealth, and by their indefatigable Indu|&s;try (all the Effects of Trade and Manufacture) have brought it to be the riche&s;t Soil, the fulle&s;t of People and of great Cities and Towns, of any Country in the World.</P>
<P>All this while <HI>England</HI> lay neglected to the la&s;t Degree; her Sons knocking their Heads again&s;t Stone-walls, and ranging the Field of War in foreign Countries, pur&s;ued their own Poverty, and &s;ought Mi&s;ery, for the Glory of their Mo|narch.</P>
<P>But at home it was all a Mi&s;cellany of Sorrow: Villainage and Va&s;&s;alage compri&s;ed the Poor; Knighthood and E&s;quire|&s;hip took up the middle Gentry; and Glory dwelt only among the Barons and Princes.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15">
All the Trade we read of, was carrying their Wool abroad, to give Employment to the Poor of foreign Countries, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>Flemings;</HI> and this Wool, we may &s;ay, was the grand Fund of the Wealth, both of King and People.</P>
<P>If the King made any Wars, and demanded Sub&s;idies of his Parliament, as was too frequently the Ca&s;e in the time of <HI>Edw.</HI> III, the grand Article of <HI>Ways and Means</HI> was to grant the King ten Shillings a Pack upon Wool, or twenty Shillings a Pack upon Wool, like our two Shillings and four Shillings <HI>per</HI> Pound upon Land; and once they came to &s;uch a Height, (God forbid we &s;hould &s;ee the like of our Lands) that the Parliament gave the King one Half Part of all the Wool it &s;elf for his Wars in <HI>France;</HI> by the &s;ame Token that (as King <HI>Charles</HI> II. did too often) all the Money was &s;pent, and no War with <HI>France</HI> begun neither; nor did the War break out 'till three Years after; &s;o that when it came, they were &s;ain to give the King new Sub&s;idies again; that is to &s;ay, another Tax upon the Exportation of Wool, and &s;o over and over again &s;everal times.</P>
<P>In this State of Indolence, or rather horrid Ignorance and Blindne&s;s, was this whole Nation, as it were, Philtred and Be|witched, notwith&s;tanding all the Glory, the Wi&s;dom, the Po|licy and good Government which King <HI>Edward</HI> III was &s;o famed for.</P>
<P>Like People buried alive in Sloth and Idlene&s;s they &s;at &s;till, ploughed and &s;owed as much Corn as &s;erved ju&s;t to feed them, &s;heer'd their Sheep every Year, and, as it may be &s;aid, threw away their Wool; went to the Wars, were knocked on the Head for the Honour of <HI>Old England,</HI> and the Glory of their great Kings; and this was the Round of Life, even from the Nobleman to the meane&s;t Va&s;&s;al, Pea&s;ant or Labourer in the Nation.</P>
<P>As to the poor Women and Children, they &s;at at home, fared hard, lived poor and idle: the Women drudg'd at the Husbandry, and the Children &s;ar &s;till, blow'd their Fingers, pick'd Straws; and both might be &s;aid not to live, but to &s;larve out a wretched time, then Die, and go, <HI>Where&mdash;</HI> who knows!</P>
<P>As to Manufacture or Employment, we do not &s;ee room &s;o much as to believe that they knew any thing of it; any far|ther than it may be to make &s;ome very ordinary things which Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Nece&s;&s;ity put them upon for their own Covering, and hardly that</P>
<P>In this mi&s;erable Condition lay the Ance&s;try of this dili|gent Nation, who being but once let into the Method of
<PB N="11" REF="16">
working the Wool, and &s;ome Authority &s;upporting as well as encouraging them by &s;topping the Stream of its Exporta|tion, &s;oon ta&s;ted the Sweets of it, &s;oon fell heartily upon it, pre&s;ently became Ma&s;ters of the Performance, and in time &s;upplanted the Encroachers; engro&s;&s;ed the Wool, for it was their own before; redeem'd the Captives, and at la&s;t brought not only the Manufactures, but the Manufacturers too, over to <HI>England;</HI> for thou&s;ands of the People followed the Manu|facture for Bread, and that they might get Employment; and this began the multiplying of the People too, as well as of their Wealth; for as Trade brings Wealth, &s;o Work brings the Workmen together.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;t thus &s;till in <HI>England:</HI> Where-ever we &s;ee the Manufactures &s;eated, there we &s;ee Multitudes of People col|lected; the Labour gathers the Hands: and this was the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion of making tho&s;e &s;trict exclu&s;ive Laws for Pari&s;h Settlements, that the particular Pari&s;hes where &s;uch Manufa|ctures were &s;et up might not be oppre&s;&s;ed with the Numbers of Poor flocking in from other Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>Where the fir&s;t Manufacturer's &s;ettled or &s;et up, the un|employed People pre&s;ently throng'd about them for Bu&s;i|ne&s;s and Wages; and we find it to this day, that where the Manufactures are, the Country is always exceeding populous; This 'tis evident the Manufactures did not find, but made it &s;o; 'tis true the Manufacture in mo&s;t Places pitch'd its Situ|ation in great Towns or Cities, &s;uch as <HI>Norwich, Colche&s;ter, Canterbury, Exeter,</HI> and the like; but 'tis al&s;o certain that tho&s;e Cities, and e&s;pecially the adjacent Countries, are grown infinitely more populous by the &s;ettling of tho&s;e Manufa|ctures among them, than they were before.</P>
<P>This is farther proved by a general View of tho&s;e Parts of <HI>England</HI> where the People are not thus employed; for where the Inhabitants of a Country con&s;i&s;t only, or chiefly, of Land|lord and Tenant, Gentry and Shopkeepers, you &s;ee the Country much le&s;s throng'd; it is true that the Multitudes which live together in tho&s;e Places where the Manufactures are e&s;tabli&s;hed as above, do influence all the re&s;t of the Na|tion by cau&s;ing a greater Cultivation of the Lands, and greater Improvement of E&s;tates, for Provi&s;ions, which the other con|&s;ume; the Corn and the Cattle being brought from the re|mote&s;t Parts for their Sub&s;i&s;tence, and by con&s;equence the Peo|ple are encreas'd there al&s;o:</P>
<P>Yet we &s;ee the Country is inhabited in a more even man|ner, the People live more at large and di&s;per&s;ed, as the Farms
<PB N="12" REF="17">
and the Lands which they cultivate call them; they are &s;pread as it were over the whole &s;ace of the Land.</P>
<P>We &s;ee no &s;uch Villages there as <HI>Leeds</HI> or <HI>Hallifax, Shef|field</HI> or <HI>Birmingham, Manche&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Froom, Taunton</HI> or <HI>Troubridge,</HI> in mo&s;t of which, or on very little Ground near them, twenty to forty thou&s;and People are &s;aid &s;everally to inhabit; and in three or four of them, as in <HI>Hallifax, Manche&s;ter, Bir|mingham,</HI> and <HI>Froom,</HI> many more.</P>
<P>But to go back to the Introduction of this Change: It was in the Reign of K. <HI>Hen.</HI> VII, and not before, when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> began the bold Adventure of Manufacturing their own Wool, (I mean began it in Quantity.) There had &s;ome Attempt been made before, and we are told of &s;ome Adventurers in Trade who having been over in <HI>Flanders</HI> and learned the Manner of it, but e&s;pecially having &s;een the Advantage of it, had brought over with them &s;o much Knowledge as to learn the People to &s;pin, (&s;o many of them at lea&s;t as their Stocks could compa&s;s to em|ploy) and others to Comb and Card the Wool, and &s;o on, thro' all the other Parts of the Work; which went a little way, and was promi&s;ing to go farther in time.</P>
<P>But it is to be ob&s;erved, that from the fir&s;t Part of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI, and thro' all that long Reign, and thro' the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV, and <HI>Richard</HI> III, the whole Nation was mi&s;erably embroiled in the Civil Confu&s;ions, &s;uch as the Wars between the White Ro&s;e and the Red; the Hou&s;es of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>York;</HI> and the &s;everal In&s;urrections and Revo|lutions of Affairs which naturally attended tho&s;e Quarrels.</P>
<P>Every one knows that War is no Friend to Trade: Arts and Improvements, much le&s;s Manufacture, and the Employ|ment of the Poor, never plant, or at lea&s;t never thrive, in the Flame and Heat of War, e&s;pecially too the wor&s;t of the kind, an Inte&s;tine, Civil, or to &s;peak ju&s;tly of it, an Unnatural War.</P>
<P>Times of Feud and Faction, Rebellion, In&s;urrection, kil|ling and plundering, are no times for Improvement; and this may be a ju&s;t Rea&s;on why the Beginnings of the Manufacture, which I have mentioned as above, took no con&s;iderable root during the Confu&s;ions of War, both Civil and Foreign Wars, but e&s;pecially Civil Wars, which for &s;ixty Years almo&s;t without Intermi&s;&s;ion vex'd this Nation.</P>
<P>Perhaps a Manufacturer did, or &s;uppo&s;e he had &s;eated him|&s;elf at any particular Town or Place in the Country, had brought together &s;ome People, and had in&s;tructed them in the Work, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome Women to &s;pin, &s;ome Men to comb, to
<PB N="13" REF="18">
weave, to dre&s;s the Cloth, and had built a Fulling Mill to thicken the Cloths, and the like: Then come the two Armies into the Field, and they march over the Country where the poor Manufacturer is &s;ettled: If it be a friendly Army, and they are of the &s;ame Side, then the kinde&s;t thing that could be expect|ed was to call all the Poor Workmen away, e&s;pecially the young able-bodied Fellows, with their Bows and Arrows to encrea&s;e the Army: If it were the Enemy, then they all run away for fear of being forced. As for the Women and Chil|dren, they are no body without the Men, for they cannot &s;pin the Wool 'till the Men comb it, and when they have &s;pun the Yarn, 'tis of no u&s;e when the Men are gone that &s;hould weave it; and perhaps the Loom which it &s;hould be wrought in, burnt by the Plunderings and Ravagings of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>By this means (and I cannot doubt but this was often the Ca&s;e) the Beginning of the Manufacture was check'd and put back, the poor Undertaker ruin'd and undone; and &s;o you heard no more of the Attempt for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>This is as good an Account as I believe can be given why the Woollen Manufacture began among us no &s;ooner; why it had no Encouragement in <HI>England,</HI> at lea&s;t no con&s;iderable Encouragement, 'till the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII, and about the Year 1480, to 1490.</P>
<P>The Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> was the fir&s;t <HI>Halcyon</HI> Sea&s;on which <HI>England</HI> had &s;elt, not for &s;ome Years only, but for &s;ome Ages, as will appear at large in the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times: Either Wars abroad, or Wars at home, had vex'd the Nation, from the unfortunate Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. to that time; all the Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Reigns will confirm it, I need not quote the Particulars, which are too many; the Na|tion was always in a Hurry and a Fright; here the Oppre&s;|&s;ions of Tyrants, there the Rebellions of People; here the Kings depos'd and murther'd, there the People ravag'd and plunder'd; now one King runs away, then another. <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. was upon the Throne, and in Pri&s;on, alternately, five or &s;ix times; <HI>Edward</HI> IV. upon the Throne, and fled out of the Country, twice at lea&s;t; and &s;o among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But <HI>Henry</HI> VII. took new Mea&s;ures, and manag'd the Pub|lick Affairs with the utmo&s;t Dexterity. He fir&s;t humbled the too powerful Nobility, &s;o to prevent Caballing and Rebellion; brought them to be all dependent upon him, and gradually im|poveri&s;h'd them, while he hoarded up immen&s;e Sums of Mo|ney him&s;elf: In a word, his Reign was a whole Scene of In|trigue and De&s;ign, among the great Ones; the King ever talking of War, and blu&s;tering at his Neighbours as if he
<PB N="14" REF="19">
would quarrel with every body; and got great Sums of Mo|ney from his Parliament to begin a War (e&s;pecially again&s;t <HI>France</HI>) but put the Money in his Pocket, and never made any War at all, and (as &s;ome &s;ay) never intended it.</P>
<P>But in the mean time (as the&s;e Cabals and Politicks at Court concerned no body but them&s;elves) his Reign, as to the Peo|ple, was all pacifick and quiet, and the Con&s;equence was vi|&s;ible, for now Indu&s;try began to hold up its Head, Trade be|gan to &s;pread, the Merchants began to &s;et up, and Navigation to be encouraged; the People of <HI>England</HI> began to look abroad and about them, and Colonies and Factories began in this ve|ry Reign to be planted, foreign Countries to be di&s;covered, and new Worlds looked into; and Some tell us that <HI>Chri&s;to|pber Columbus</HI> having now di&s;covered <HI>America,</HI> came over hi|ther, and made the fir&s;t Offer for a farther Di&s;covery to King <HI>Henry,</HI> and particularly to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for him, but that the King (by the meer Narrowne&s;s of his Soul) declin'd the Expence of it.</P>
<P>Al&s;o 'tis affirm'd, that &s;everal Voyages were made in this King's Reign to the We&s;tern Shoars of <HI>Africk,</HI> and to the Gold Coa&s;t, and great Advantages made by it to the Mer|chants, bringing pure Gold back for the mo&s;t worthle&s;s Tri|fles: But this is not to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, only thus far, that this being a Reign of pro&s;ound Peace, Arts and Commerce began to reli&s;h with the People, and they began to turn their Hands to &s;everal kinds of Improvement.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, this of the Woollen Manufacture came principally into play. The King, who had liv'd abroad, as well in <HI>Flanders</HI> as in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Brittany,</HI> had &s;een with Re|gret, how not the <HI>Flemings</HI> only, but the <HI>French</HI> grew rich at the Expence of <HI>England,</HI> and how even they could not re|frain mocking the Sloth and Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that &s;hould let their Wool be carried out of the Kingdom, to be work'd up into Cloths and Stuffs; and in a word, be manufactured abroad, and then buy even the Cloths they wore of their own Wool &s;o manufactured abroad.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be con&s;e&s;s'd it de&s;erv'd Reproach, and when we come to look back upon it at this di&s;tance, we cannot help wondering at the Madne&s;s of the People, but there are &s;o ma|ny other Examples of the unaccountable Stupidity of tho&s;e Ages, e&s;pecially of the common People, that if they were all to be brought upon the Stage, we &s;hould cea&s;e to wonder at any thing of this kind; as particularly, how they were blind|ly given up to the ab&s;olute Tyranny of the Nobility, in Civil Matters, and to the ab&s;olute Government of the ignorant Prie&s;ts, on the Side of Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="20">
But not to dwell upon the Folly of tho&s;e Ages, I proceed to take a View of the Advances our Ance&s;tors made in the re|covering this glorious Trade; and even in that, I &s;hall not en|large upon the little Beginnings, and un&s;ucce&s;sful Attempts, which (as above) were made by private Pur&s;es, and on private Experiments, before the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. for if we may believe <HI>Fame,</HI> there were &s;everal private E&s;&s;ays made, for the engaging in, and carrying on a Manufacture of Woollen Cloth, before that Time, &s;ome of which began to promi&s;e Suc|ce&s;s too; and the People began to reli&s;h the Thing, and ta&s;te the Profit of it before.</P>
<P>Had it not been &s;o, we can hardly think that King <HI>Henry</HI> could, all at once, bring the People of <HI>England</HI> to a general Manufacturing, &s;o as effectually to &s;top the Exportation of the Wool, as he certainly did in the eighteenth Year of his Reign, or thereabout.</P>
<P>But &s;everal People having attempted it before, &s;ome without Succe&s;s, and &s;ome with; and the Thing beginning gradually to encrea&s;e and get ground in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. the King, who (as above) having &s;een the innumerable Numbers of Peo|ple working at it abroad, and being thereby fully &s;en&s;ible of the Advantage it would be to his own Subjects, if they could be brought to engage in it at home, fir&s;t &s;et heartily about it a|mong his own Subjects, encouraging tho&s;e that were engag'd in it, and promi&s;ing Encouragement to others to go about it; &s;o that he brought &s;everal Men of Intere&s;t among his Nobili|ty, and others, to e&s;pou&s;e it, and the Manufacture was &s;et on foot in that manner in &s;everal Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and that with apparent Succe&s;s; as particularly, (if we may credit private Accounts) the fir&s;t Appearance of the Woollen Manufacture of Cloth was at <HI>Wakefield,</HI> in the We&s;t Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> being encouraged by an ancient Knight and Favourite of King <HI>Henry,</HI> of the Name of <HI>Savil,</HI> and &s;ome other Per&s;ons of Rank, who had E&s;tates in that Country, and who encourag'd their Tenants and Va&s;&s;als to the Work. This <HI>Savil,</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e to be &s;ome of the Ance&s;tors of the late Marquis of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> one of who&s;e Titles is taken from the Town of <HI>Eland,</HI> in the &s;ame Part of the Country, and upon the Banks of the <HI>Calder,</HI> not far from <HI>Wakefield,</HI> of whom the Po&s;teri|ty are Lords <HI>Eland</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>The next Place to which the Manufacture &s;pread, was the Town of <HI>Okingham</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire;</HI> where it did not continue long, or at lea&s;t was not contain'd in the narrow Bounds of that &s;mall Place, but &s;pread it &s;elf to the larger Towns of <HI>Ba|&s;ing&s;toke</HI> and <HI>Andover</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and to
<PB N="16" REF="21">
<HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Newberry,</HI> in which four la&s;t Towns it continued even 'till within the&s;e few Years, to an extraordinary Magni|tude; but it is now remov'd farther We&s;t, into <HI>Wilt&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. Then the Counte&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> Mo|ther to King <HI>Henry</HI> VII, encouraged &s;ome money'd Men to &s;et it up again in the Villages about <HI>Woking,</HI> on the River <HI>Wey,</HI> where, or near which, &s;he liv'd, with a great and noble Ho&s;|pitality, doing good to all the poor People round about her, and particularly by thus &s;etling them to work, and that from thence began the Cloathing about <HI>Guildford, Godlaming, Dark|ing,</HI> &amp;c. all Towns in <HI>Surrey;</HI> and in other Places thereabouts, and which continues there (tho' decay'd) to this Day.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time after the&s;e private Per&s;ons undertook the manufacturing of Wool, that King <HI>Henry,</HI> finding his Sub|jects begin to improve, and that the Goods they made were able to &s;upply the ordinary Demand, or near it; cau&s;ed the Ex|portation of Wool to be prohibited, and foreign-made Manu|factures al&s;o to be excluded, encouraging his People thereby to make larger Quantities of tho&s;e Goods at home.</P>
<P>Nor did there need any greater Encouragement to the Ma|nufacture, than thus &s;hutting out the foreign Manufactures; for this encrea&s;ing the Demand at home, the Price encreas'd of cour&s;e, which &s;ufficiently rewarded the Labours of the Work|men, and encreas'd their Wages.</P>
<P>I need not bring any Vouchers to prove, that this Encrea&s;e of Wages improved the Manufacture, or encreas'd the Num|ber of the Workmen; for now, not only the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fell in|to the Trade with Courage, and with Multitudes, but (as above) Multitudes follow'd the Manufacture out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> en|couraged by the Gain, and wanting Employment at home.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e of the labouring Poor only, but abundance of the Ma&s;ter Manufacturers, and of tho&s;e the mo&s;t skilful in the Workman&s;hip; by whom the People here were &s;oon in&s;tructed and perfected in the Knowledge, not of the Art on|ly in general, &s;uch as in the Sorting, Combing, Carding, and otherwi&s;e managing the Wool, in Spinning, Weaving, Knit|ting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but al&s;o in the &s;everal kinds of Goods fitted for the Markets, and demanded as well abroad as at home.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ecur'd the Trade to them&s;elves, and be|came fir&s;t Ma&s;ters of the Woollen Manufacture; and the ve|ry <HI>Flemings</HI> them&s;elves, who had for &s;o many Ages eat the Bread out of their Mouths, were now their A&s;&s;i&s;tants and In|&s;tructors, in compleating them in the Knowledge of Dre&s;&s;ing, Sheering, Perfecting, and Fini&s;hing the working Part; thou|&s;ands of the &s;aid <HI>Flemings,</HI> and their Families, coming over
<PB N="17" REF="22">
hither for Work, and &s;ettling among them, and who&s;e Po&s;te|rity became <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> immediately after them, &s;carcely re&s;er|ving their foreign Names, or changing them, to conceal their Original.</P>
<P>For it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that it was not &s;o ea&s;y a Matter for Foreigners to be naturalized among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in tho&s;e times, as it is now, which made tho&s;e that found means to &s;ettle here, and turn their Hands to the Manufacture, take what care they could to conceal them&s;elves, and &s;o to change their Sir-names, or at lea&s;t &s;horten and abridge them into differing Sounds, that they might be made to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible, that is to &s;ay, to &s;ound like <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> for Example; <HI>Jean de Somteres</HI> would be called <HI>John Sommers; Guillaume de Tournay, William Turner; E&s;ticnne D'Anvers, Stephen Danvers; Jaques de Franquemont, James Franks;</HI> and &s;o of the re&s;t; by which all the <HI>Flemi&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Walloon</HI> Names were pre|&s;ently turn'd into <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And thus of tho&s;e who had two or three Chri&s;tian Names (as is common among Foreigners) they turn'd the &s;econd Chri&s;tian Name into a Sir-name, and from thence 'tis &s;aid we have &s;o many Families of &s;uch Sir|names among us to this Day; for Example, <HI>Jean Jaques de Buromeir,</HI> leaving out the Sir-name, was called <HI>John James; Guillaume Jacob Van Platten, William Jacobs; Guillaume Henry de Villangen, William Henry;</HI> and many more of this kind, as we find the <HI>French</HI> Refugees of the la&s;t Age are do|ing at this very time; <HI>Jean de Morlaix</HI> is now <HI>John Morley;</HI> and but the other Day, <HI>Jaques de Guilote</HI> call'd him&s;elf <HI>James Gill,</HI> and the like is done every Day, &s;o that the Families are no more known to be foreign. But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We find very little upon Record, relating to the Wool be|ing carried into <HI>Flanders</HI> after this; or of the <HI>Flemings</HI> making broad Cloth and Stuffs, nor indeed are our Laws much con|cerned about tho&s;e Affairs, except that King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. to|wards the End of his Reign, had &s;ome Laws made to regulate the Lengths and Breadths of the Cloths made here, in order to bring the Clothiers into a Regularity of working, and that the &s;everal &s;orts of Goods &s;hould be all alike, equal to one ano|ther, and as near as po&s;&s;ible of an equal Goodne&s;s and Value; &s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h the Price of every kind at Market, and pre|vent Frauds.</P>
<P>Hence came the fixing of Marks and Seals to the Cloths; at fir&s;t, every Maker &s;triving to add a Reputation to his own Manufacture, and pretending it to be &s;uperiour in its Finene&s;s or Goodne&s;s, to his Neighbours, &s;et his Mark at the End, wrought into the Cloth, in &s;ome different Colour, or (as af|er &s;ome time was practis'd) Leaden Seals, with the Maker's

Name, and the Weight of the Cloth &s;tamp'd upon them; and hence after &s;ome time the &s;everal Towns and Corporations, denominating the Manufacture from the Place, obtained Pri|vileges and Immunities, Powers and Authority to regulate the Length, and Breadth, and Goodne&s;s of the &s;everal Manu|factures made in tho&s;e Towns re&s;pectively, &s;tamping the Lea|den Seals with the Town Marks or Arms, as at <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> at <HI>Norwich,</HI> at <HI>Leeds,</HI> and &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>It is true that in this Interval between &s;topping the Wool from being exported, and bringing the Manufacture at home to a Perfection, two Inconveniences happened.</P>
<P N="1">1. The King's Revenue was greatly impaired, and even the Parliament were put to Difficulties for <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions to rai&s;e Money for the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s; for the u&s;ual Fund for rai&s;ing Money, when the ordinary Sub&s;idies, Tenths and Fifteenths were not &s;ufficient, was by granting the King twenty Shillings or forty Shillings, as the Publick Occa&s;ion called for it, upon each Pack of Wool; whereas now the Wool being detained at home, the Clothiers paying no Duty upon that which they bought at home, nor any Tax upon the Cloths when made, the Revenue to the Crown was &s;topt at once; and this perhaps might be the rea&s;on, that notwith&s;tanding the Prohibition in <HI>Henry</HI> VII's time, which perhaps was temporary and &s;o might be expir'd, we find the Wool was exported again to <HI>Flanders</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII; and in the Fourth of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI, we find mention made of a <HI>Wool Fleet</HI> of &s;ixty Sail bound to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which I take to be partly al&s;o occa|&s;ioned by this next Article, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the Clothing being yet young in <HI>England,</HI> tho' greatly improved (con&s;idering the time it had been &s;et up in) the Manufacturers were not able to work up the whole Quan|tity of Wool which grew in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o the Govern|ment was obliged either to allow or wink at its being car|ried abroad, as it certainly was all the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, and of <HI>Edward</HI> VI al&s;o, tho' in the &s;aid fourth Year of <HI>Ed.</HI> VI they con&s;ulted much upon erecting a Mart for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth and Block Tin to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd at <HI>Southampton;</HI> &s;o that none of tho&s;e Goods &s;hould be &s;old at any other Place, for the South-We&s;t Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and at <HI>Hull</HI> for the North Parts; this la&s;t to accommodate the Merchants of the Ea&s;t-Seas called the <HI>Hans,</HI> and al&s;o for the Ea&s;e and Advantage of the Northern Clothiers in <HI>England;</HI> for that it was ob|&s;erved even then, that the Clothing Trade flouri&s;hed in tho&s;e early Times in the We&s;t-Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> viz. at <HI>Wake|field, Halifax, Leeds,</HI> &amp;c. more than in any other Part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24">
However, as I have &s;aid, that the Clothiers were not yet able to work up all the Growth of the Wool in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o there &s;eemed to be a Nece&s;&s;ity to let &s;ome Part of it be &s;ent abroad; yet it was re&s;olved in King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Council, it &s;eems, to &s;top the Fleet which was ju&s;t then going for <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and to have the Wool kept at home, to encourage the Mart intended to be erected at <HI>Southampton:</HI> But the Fleet was &s;ailed out of <HI>Dover</HI> Harbour, and out of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> before the Order of Council was pa&s;&s;ed, and could reach them; and &s;o the Wool went away; and the King's Death following &s;oon after, tho&s;e Re&s;olves came to Nothing for that time.</P>
<P>In the next Reign, <HI>Philip</HI> II, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> marrying Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> it was not to be expected that a Prohibi|tion &s;o much to the Prejudice of the Trade of the <HI>Nether|lands,</HI> which were King <HI>Philip</HI>'s proper Dominion, &s;hould pa&s;s in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o that we have Rea&s;on to believe the Prohi|bition of &s;ending Wool over the Seas, was at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended for that Reign; and what happen'd in the next, we &s;hall have frequent Occa&s;ion to mention as we go on.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the Infant State of the Woollen Manufa|cture; from what rational Mea&s;ures it received its fir&s;t Encou|ragement in <HI>England,</HI> and how gradually it came on; for we mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that as it was a thing of va&s;t Magni|tude, as well as of the utmo&s;t Importance to this Nation, &s;o it was not ea&s;ily, much le&s;s &s;uddenly, brought to Perfecti|on; the Stream or Channel of &s;o great a Commerce was not &s;oon changed, tho' our People came into it with Chearful|ne&s;s, and made wonderful Progre&s;s for the time; yet <HI>This Rome</HI> was not built in a Day, it was many Years, nay Ages, before it came to Perfection.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Beginnings of it I take to have been in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV, that is to &s;ay, of its being attempted by pri|vate Hands: The fir&s;t publick Countenance it receiv'd, was at neare&s;t about the Year 1480, in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VII, and it was from thence to the Year 1560 <HI>(viz.)</HI> under Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> before it came to its Perfection; &s;o that it was above an hundred and twenty Years, as we may call it, in its State of <HI>Nonage,</HI> tho' all the while encrea&s;ing and grow|ing, and in a promi&s;ing View of a pro&s;perous Magnitude, the &s;ame which we have &s;ince &s;een it arrive to.</P>
<P>It had indeed a mo&s;t glorious Patron (or Patrone&s;s) and Protector in Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> who not only pro|moted and encouraged it at home, but al&s;o extended the Trade for the Con&s;umption of it abroad; for in her Time, the &s;everal Branches of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce were extended into almo&s;t all Parts of the known World; the <HI>Turkey</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="25">
Trade, and the <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> Trade e&s;tabli&s;hed; the Colonies in <HI>America</HI> di&s;covered and planted, by all which the Woollen Manufacture obtained a Vent in foreign Markets, and tho&s;e great Branches of its Con&s;umption, which have &s;ince been &s;o large, and are &s;till the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in her time, particularly (I &s;ay) that of <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>But nothing contributed &s;o effectually to the Pro&s;perity of the Woollen Manufacture in this Nation, and which may be &s;aid (under the wi&s;e Conduct of that glorious Queen) to compleat the whole Fabrick, giving the mortal Stroke to, unhinging the whole Trade in, and &s;hutting it for ever out from, the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> as the long and bloody War between the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and his Subjects in tho&s;e Coun|tries, on account of the Liberties and Religion of the People.</P>
<P>By this, the People were di&s;tracted and &s;eparated, the No|bility murthered, the Towns ruin'd, the Country plunder'd, the United Provinces (now call'd the <HI>States-General</HI>) entirely broken off from the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Government; thou&s;ands of the People fled over to <HI>England,</HI> where they were kindly re|ceived, ho&s;pitably relieved, courteou&s;ly entertained, and (which was above all the re&s;t) encouraged to &s;et up their Ma|nufactures in the Towns and Corporations, wherever they pleas'd; and this encreas'd and compleated the manufacturing Trade in <HI>England.</HI> And thus we have brought it within View (at lea&s;t) of its pre&s;ent State.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manu|factures in the Ages pa&s;t, both Abroad and at Home; with a &s;ummary Account of its Gradations.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not to be reckon'd a &s;mall Part of the Encrea&s;e of the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>England</HI> (con&s;idering its Ori|ginal was from Abroad) that it was made capable of &s;upplying the Demands of the Home Trade, and was con&s;iderable e|nough to cloath its own People: Nor was it under above an hundred Years Improvement from its beginning, that this could be attained to, as is Noted above.</P>
<P>The Manufacturers abroad not only out-work'd us, but under-work'd us; they made their Goods both better and cheaper; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had great Advantages, but no Experience, &s;o
<PB N="21" REF="26">
that &s;till &s;ome of the nicer and better Manufactures were made in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> nor was there any avoiding it at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But when the <HI>Flemings</HI> (per&s;ecuted and terrified by the Cru|elty and Per&s;ecution of the Duke <HI>D'Alva</HI>) fled over hither, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> gave them Protection and Encourage|ment here, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> then became ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the Manufactures, and from thence we may Date the Perfection of their Skill; then all foreign Importation might be &s;aid to cea&s;e, and the carrying abroad of the Wool was made Cri|minal.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee how its Con&s;umption went on.</P>
<P N="1">1. At Home; the whole Country was cloathed, Poor and Rich; nothing &s;o fine, but it was to be had in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Wilt&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Bark&s;hire: Jack</HI> of <HI>New|bury</HI> was a Clothier &s;uperior to any that are to be found among us at this Time, by many Thou&s;ands, as Money went then; and Mr. <HI>Kenrick</HI>'s Will, of St. <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI>'s (who was ori|ginally a Clothier, and then a Cloth Merchant, dealing to <HI>Dort</HI>) te&s;tifies how con&s;iderable the Trade was by that Time, (<HI>viz.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> 1.) when he left above <HI>40000l.</HI> in Gifts and Charities, be&s;ides the Bulk of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. But let us al&s;o take a View of its Encrea&s;e Abroad, from Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, be&s;ides its being able fully to &s;upply all the People at Home.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Queen e&s;tabli&s;hed a flouri&s;hing Company, called the <HI>Levant</HI> Merchants (the &s;ame we now call the <HI>Turkey</HI> Company) by which &s;he extended the Trade of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for their fine Broad Cloths, into the &s;everal Courts of <HI>Per&s;ia, Turkey,</HI> and <HI>Egypt;</HI> for either the Queen, or the <HI>Turkey</HI> Com|pany (I am not &s;ure which) making &s;ome Pre&s;ents to the Grand Seignior of fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, of &s;uch exqui&s;ite Workman&s;hip for the Finene&s;s of the Cloth, and of &s;uch beautiful Colours, being dyed Scarlet and Crim&s;on, the &s;aid Grand Seignior, and the Grand Vizier, cau&s;ed fine Robes or Gowns to be made of the &s;aid Cloths; and al&s;o fine Ve&s;ts, after their manner, which being &s;urred with Sables and rich Furrs, pre&s;ented them much about the &s;ame time from the Great Duke (&s;o the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Emperor was then call'd) of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI> made a mo&s;t magnificent Appearance; the Grand Seig|nior and his Courtiers were &s;o plea&s;ed with them, that they &s;oon became the Mode or Wear of all the great Officers, and of the Grand Seignior him&s;elf, and &s;o again of the Vi|ziers or Viceroys of their remote&s;t Provinces, and the &s;ame at the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">
Thus in a few Years, the fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth became the Robes of Maje&s;ty, and (as it were) the Badge of Greatne&s;s and Glory, at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> at <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and at <HI>Aleppo</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and every where el&s;e among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> where they had Money &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e them; and thus it continues to this Day, which is &s;till more &s;trange than all the re&s;t</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;ame <HI>Levant</HI> Company included the Trade to <HI>Alex|andria</HI> in the Mouth of the great River <HI>Nile,</HI> by which all the Country of <HI>Egypt</HI> was &s;upplyed; and not only the great Court of the V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">zier of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> (who, tho' a Subject or Slave of the Grand Seignior, yet keeps a Court almo&s;t as great and as magnificent as the Emperor his Ma&s;ter) but al&s;o the &s;ame C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oths were convoyed to <HI>Suez,</HI> a Sea-Port of the <HI>Turks</HI> in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and thence by Water to <HI>Judde,</HI> or <HI>Ieddo,</HI> the Sea Port to the City of <HI>Medina,</HI> the great Center of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Super&s;tition, where the Riches and Magni|ficence of their Prie&s;ts is not to be de&s;crib'd; and where they are &s;till cloath'd in the &s;ame manner, e&s;pecially on their Days of Ceremony.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ame <HI>Levant</HI> Company extended the Trade for <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Cloth to the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> at the bottom of the <HI>Adria|tick</HI> Gulph, where they drove a very great and advantagious Trade; for I &s;uppo&s;e that the Trade of <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Scan|deroon,</HI> and the Caravans by <HI>Aleppo</HI> to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> were not at that time found out by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but were carried on (if at all) by the Merchants of <HI>Venice;</HI> who at that time engro&s;s'd indeed all the Commerce of the Ea&s;t, imported the Spices and all the rich Goods of the <HI>Indies,</HI> by the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and by the Caravans of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> and <HI>Bagdat</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and &s;ent back by the &s;ame Conveyance &s;uch <HI>European</HI> Goods as tho&s;e Countries demanded; among which, the fine Broad Cloths of <HI>England,</HI> &s;oon after that time, began to be the mo&s;t acceptable, and were indeed of the greate&s;t Value of any thing of that kind in the World.</P>
<P N="4">4. Likewi&s;e in this Queen's Reign, the Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> or the <HI>White Sea,</HI> being di&s;covered, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants found Means to carry on a Trade from that Port, by Water-Carriage, to the great City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> a little way excepted, where their Goods were carried by Land about &s;ixty Miles only.</P>
<P>Here they al&s;o found a Market for their rich Cloths, in the great Duke's Court; and upon this a new Society for Com|merce was erected, and were call'd the <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> Company; who brought back a very gainful Return in Sables, Ermins, and other rich Furrs, the Produce of the wild and barren De&s;arts of <HI>Siberia</HI> and the North.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="28">
N.B. <HI>The&s;e</HI> Mu&s;covy <HI>Merchants found the Way, &s;ome time after this, to pa&s;s by the great River</HI> Wolga, <HI>to</HI> A&s;tra|can, <HI>and thence into the</HI> Ca&s;pian Sea, <HI>an Inland Naviga|tion</HI> (<HI>reckoning from</HI> Jerow&s;law, <HI>where they fir&s;t em|barked their Goods</HI>) <HI>of very near</HI> 2000 <HI>Miles on one Ri|ver,</HI> viz. <HI>the</HI> Wolga; <HI>hence</HI> (<HI>unwearted in their Search after new Worlds of</HI> Trade) <HI>they pa&s;s'd the</HI> Ca&s;pian, <HI>landed in</HI> Gerogia, <HI>pa&s;s'd over the Mountains of</HI> Arme|nia, <HI>and reach'd into the Heart of the Kingdom of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>where they found an extraordinary Reception, &s;old their fine Cloths at an extravagant Price, &s;uch as was even &s;urprizing to them&s;elves; and brought back Bales of raw Silk to a very great Advantage al&s;o; &s;o that notwith|&s;tanding the extraordinary Charges of &s;o exceeding long a Travel, they made a very profitable Voyage.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two new Trades gave a very great Encouragement to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, and particularly to the Manufa|cture of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, which now obtain'd &s;uch a Reputa|tion over the whole Trading World, that nothing was e|qually valuable in any, or perhaps in all the Courts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. In the latter End of this Queen's Reign, the &s;ame Ma|nufactures were demanded in an exceeding manner in the Northern Parts of the Empire, and the Countries bordering on the <HI>Baltick;</HI> and this Trade naturally fell into the Hands of the <HI>Hans,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Society of Merchants who call'd them&s;elves the <HI>Hans,</HI> a Word &s;ignifying a <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> or an <HI>United Company;</HI> and becau&s;e there were &s;o many (for there was once no le&s;s than Seventy two Cities of them) they were called the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns; the&s;e carried on the Trade of the North, as the <HI>Venetians</HI> did that of the South and Ea&s;t, mentioned above.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Towns, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture was indeed wonderfully extended, that is to &s;ay, into all the Countries in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Mecklemberg,</HI> both the <HI>Pomerens, Pru&s;&s;ia, Cour|land, Livonia, Ea&s;thonia,</HI> &amp;c. and up the great Rivers of tho&s;e Countries, into the very Heart of the Empire, and of all the Northern Countries; for Example,</P>

<P>Particularly the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by the Navigation of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Maes</HI> (two great Rivers, and one of them, without Com|pari&s;on, the greate&s;t River for Trade and Inland Navigation in <HI>Europe</HI>) carried tho&s;e Goods up into the middle of the South|ern Countries of the Empire; for now the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Cloth was become the general Favourite of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> were the chief Article at the great Fairs of <HI>Ausburg, Nuremberg, Franck&s;ort,</HI> and <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> the greate&s;t Marts of <HI>Europe</HI> at that time, if not in the World; and which continue in a flouri&s;hing Condition to this Day, tho' &s;en&s;ibly declining in that particular Article which was their fir&s;t Ri&s;e and Foundation; I mean that of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture, as I &s;hall &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">w in its Place.</P>

The <HI>Neckar,</HI> a Navigable River al&s;o, running thro' the fruitful rich Country of the Count <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing by the Cities of <HI>Heidleberg, Hailbron,</HI> and the Moun|tains of the Black Fore&s;t, and within a few Miles of the Ci|ty of <HI>Ulm</HI> upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> where that great River begins to be Navigable, and by which the &s;aid Trade had a Communi|cation with all the great Cities and Rivers of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Ba|varia,</HI> and even down to <HI>Pa&s;&s;au, Lintz</HI> and <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Aar,</HI> a large River of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> al&s;o Navigable, which ri&s;ing out of the &s;ame Mountains of the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> from whence the <HI>Rhine</HI> it &s;elf proceeded, pa&s;&s;es thro' the City of <HI>Bern,</HI> near that of <HI>Zurick,</HI> and other con&s;iderable Parts of
<PB N="26" REF="31">
the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Cantons, and falling into the <HI>Rbine</HI> a little above <HI>Ba&s;le,</HI> carryed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture into the Can|tons of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland;</HI> as it does now &s;erve, to our great Mor|tification, to bring the like Manufactures now made in <HI>Swi&s;|&s;erland,</HI> down into <HI>Germany,</HI> and to the great Fairs of <HI>Nu|remberg</HI> and <HI>Franck&s;ort,</HI> where they Under&s;ell and Supplant us, as &s;hall be &s;een in its Place.</P>
<P>In this flouri&s;hing Condition Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> left the Wool|len Manufacture of <HI>England;</HI> being at that time not the great|e&s;t Manufacture in <HI>Europe</HI> only (for &s;o it may be called &s;till, tho' &s;inking and declining a-pace) but the mo&s;t encrea&s;ing, thriving, and ri&s;ing Trade (at that time) in the World.</P>
<P>As the Woollen Manufacture had thus been about an hundred and fifty Years in its growing and encrea&s;ing Condi|tion, like a young Oak in the Woods; &s;o now being grown Major, or as we &s;ay <HI>of Age,</HI> and out of its <HI>Nonage,</HI> we may allow it to have continued above another Century in its flouri&s;hing and pro&s;perous State; that is to &s;ay, it held its own, and continued in its full Glory, extended to an infinite Length and Breadth, triumphing over the whole World of Commerce, not rival'd, not imitated, I will not &s;ay, not envyed, but really not rival'd by any People or in any Country in the World; no, not &s;o much as pretended to be rival'd any where: And this la&s;t hundred Years which I reckon to be the State of its full Glory and Perfection, I take to be from the Middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, to the End of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. that is to &s;ay, near the End of it, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Year 1580, twenty Years before Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> died, to the Year 1680, being the latter End of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>During this time, the Manufactures were &s;o far from re|ceiving any Blow, any mortal Wound or &s;en&s;ible Di&s;a&s;ter, either from abroad or at home, that the &s;everal Circum&s;tances relating to the Vent and Con&s;umption of them concurred to enlarge them and render their Condition yet more flouri&s;hing and pro&s;perous, if that could be, than they were before. For Example,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> During that Interval of Time, many flouri&s;hing and now famous Colonies of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had been &s;ettled in <HI>America,</HI> and in other remote Parts of the World; the Di&s;coveries of the indefatigable Adventurers of that Age; &s;uch as Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> the famous Earl of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> and others, too many to name, by whom the Commerce of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> was extended in a prodigious man|ner, and their Dominions al&s;o; as in the following Countries in particular:

<P>In all the&s;e, the &s;ucceeding Generations have &s;o improved, the Plantations have been &s;o &s;pread, &s;o well managed, and the Numbers of People are &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly encrea&s;ed, that where|as in the Beginning of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign it is creditably affirmed there were not Five thou&s;and People in all of them, Negroes excepted, and not abundance of Them: 'Tis now as creditably in&s;i&s;ted upon, that there are not le&s;s than a Million of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects, Slaves included; which mon&s;trous En|crea&s;e is not only an Addition to the Greatne&s;s and Glory of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominion and to their Commerce, by the immen&s;e Return of their Product to <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as from the Continent in Tobacco, Rice, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, Train-Oil, Fi&s;h, Whale-fins, Furs, Drugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to the other Colonies on the I&s;lands in Corn, Meal, Peas, Pork, Beer, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from the I&s;lands to <HI>England,</HI> in Sugar, Rum, Mela&s;&s;es, Ginger, Cot|ton, Indico, Piemento, Cocoa, and many other valuable things. I &s;ay, this Encrea&s;e of People is not only an Encrea&s;e of Com|merce, in the Returns above-named, but it adds to the Con&s;ump|tion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures in an extraordinary manner; not only all that Million of People being to be cloathed from hence, but that they have in all Places upon the &s;aid Conti|nent taught the Natives of the Country to go cloathed al&s;o; and who are &s;upplyed with Manufactures from <HI>England;</HI> all which is a meer Addition to the Trade, as well as to the Navigation of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince the time above-named; nothing of tho&s;e Countries being then known, much le&s;s any Trade to them.</P>
<P>It may be objected, and has been pretended, that the fir&s;t Planters or Inhabitants of tho&s;e Colonies coming from <HI>Eng|land</HI> is no Addition; for that the &s;ame Encrea&s;e would have been from them at home, if they had not gone abroad.</P>
<P>But as this requires a long and full An&s;wer, &s;uch a full An|&s;wer may be given to it hereafter; and particularly this, that tho&s;e Inhabitants generally going over thither in mean Cir|cum&s;tances, and growing rich there by their Indu&s;try, have quite altered the Ca&s;e; and that the Encrea&s;e of the &s;ame People, if it had happened, had probably been an Encrea&s;e
<PB N="28" REF="33">
both of unprofitable Hands and Mouths; whereas here they have been ju&s;t the contrary, and their Po&s;terity being rich and indu&s;trious, have thereby encrea&s;ed the publick Wealth as well as the Numbers of People: But this is not to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is certain, that &s;ince Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, not our Colonies only, but the whole Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> is encrea&s;|ed in People in a wonderful manner; and that notwith&s;tanding the prodigious Numbers who we can account for, as de&s;troyed out of the ordinary cour&s;e of Nature; &s;uch as by War abroad and at home, Plague, Shipwreck, peopling of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and other Ca&s;es, by which &s;ome Millions may have been de&s;troyed, and no doubt have been.</P>
<P>All this Encrea&s;e of People has been an Addition to the Con&s;umption of the Manufactures, and con&s;equently an En|crea&s;e of it; and to &s;ay, that the Manufacture was encrea&s;ed by its being &s;ufficient to clothe the Inhabitants in <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth's Reign, was to &s;ay little or nothing, compared to what the Importance of the &s;ame Article would be now, &s;eeing we cannot doubt but that there are at lea&s;t Four Millions of People in the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> at this time, more than there were at the End of the Year 1500.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Foundation of this Encrea&s;e was, without doubt, &s;aid in the fixing the Manufactures at home, which were be|fore &s;ettled in <HI>Flanders,</HI> as I have &s;aid; and the next Step was the Per&s;ecution of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> mentioned al&s;o above.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of tho&s;e Articles, as &s;ome are of Opinion, brought over at lea&s;t one hundred thou&s;and <HI>Flemings</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> where Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> far from being ignorant of the Be|nefit that Numbers of People would be to her Dominions, where &s;he knew well there was Bu&s;ine&s;s enough to employ them gave them all imaginable Encouragement, appointed them Churches, admitted them to &s;et up in Corporations, exempted them from Taxes, and the like; and we &s;ee their Po&s;terity here to this Day, di&s;tingui&s;hed by Name in many of our Manufacturing Towns, as the <HI>Rebows</HI> at <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>De Vinks</HI> at <HI>Norwich,</HI> the <HI>Papilons</HI> at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>I might give Examples of the ca&s;ual Encrea&s;e of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Manufactures both abroad and at home; within the Compa&s;s of an hundred and twenty Years now pa&s;&s;ed, from the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as limited above, to this time; all which may &s;erve further to prove the then flou|ri&s;hing Condition of that Trade; &s;uch as the &s;everal Factories of
<PB N="29" REF="34">
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in other Parts of the World; and the Encrea&s;e of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugueze</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> which have &s;till added to the Encrea&s;e of the Manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the Con&s;umption being &s;o very great among tho&s;e Nations.</P>
<P>Hitherto then we have &s;een the bright Side of the Subject, and have brought the Manufacture to its Meridian Height: It is only to be ob&s;erved as an Addition to what has been &s;aid, that as the Con&s;umption of the Manufacture encrea&s;ed abroad, &s;o the Quantity made encrea&s;ed at home. The Ma|nufactures encrea&s;ing, the Manufacturers encrea&s;ed al&s;o; the Trade &s;pread at home in Proportion as it &s;pread abroad; and that which was at fir&s;t the Work of a few Counties and Ci|ties, became now the Employment of whole Provinces or Divi&s;ions of the Country, being a kind of Di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Counties or Parts of Counties together.</P>
<P>Thus the Manufacture, fir&s;t erected at <HI>Norwich,</HI> &s;pread in a little after the &s;aid time, over the whole Counties of <HI>Nor|folk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk:</HI> As the Bay Trade of <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> fir&s;t confined to that Town and the adjacent Country, is now extended thro' the whole County, one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous in <HI>England.</HI> The Clothing Trade erected fir&s;t at the Towns of <HI>Oakingham, Reading, Newbery,</HI> and <HI>Andover,</HI> in the Coun|tries of <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> is now &s;pread farther into <HI>Wilt|&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> extending along a va&s;t Tract of Ground from the Edge of <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> to the &s;ide of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> for near an hundred Miles, thro' the riche&s;t and mo&s;t fruitful Vale in all the We&s;t Part of <HI>England</HI> called, <HI>the Vale of White-Hor&s;e,</HI> and including the populous Towns of <LIST>

<P>The like in the Clothing of <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> extended into the Counties of <HI>Salop, Hereford, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and the Counties ad|jacent.</P>
<P>Thus, I &s;ay, the Manufacture flouri&s;hing abroad, &s;pread in Proportion at home, 'till at length it arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the Magnitude which we &s;ee it in at this time, when its Body is &s;aid to be too big for its Legs; and the Multitudes employed in it are
<PB N="30" REF="35">
&s;uch, that at the &s;ame time that the Markets are decayed a|broad, the Extent of it not being limited at home, the Laws of Proportion have been broken; and tho' the Sale has been le&s;&s;en'd, the People have &s;till gone on making, 'till ac|cording to &s;ome, the Quantity has been &s;uperior to what the whole World could, or at lea&s;t in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Trade would con&s;ume. And this brings us to the pre&s;ent State of the Manufacture, as it &s;tands aborad ju&s;t now with re&s;pect to the Sale, and as it &s;tands at home with re&s;pect to the Produ|ction, by which it will be ea&s;ily &s;een, whether the Manu|facture as a Trade or as a Bu&s;ine&s;s is in a thriving or a de|clining Condition.</P>

<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture, as well abroad as at home; with a ju&s;t Deduction from the Pro&s;pect of it to the Question in hand <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whe|ther it is in a Declining Condition or no.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een &s;omething of the pa&s;t State of the Woollen Manufacture: Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> brought it into a flou|ri&s;hing Condition, in which it continued with &s;everal large Additions to its Pro&s;perity, and a continual Encrea&s;e of its Magnitude, and of its Con&s;umption, to the Time of the late Re&s;toration; in which time if it &s;unk in one Article, it ro&s;e in another; &s;o that we might &s;ay, it was always flouri&s;hing, and was rather greater than le&s;s at the end of the next hundred Years, than at the beginning; that is to &s;ay, at the Year 1700, than at the Year 1602, when Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> died.</P>
<P>Certain it is that the Con&s;umption was infinitely encreas'd, the Trade abroad perfectly good; Experience as well as Hi|&s;tory confirms that even in the Height of the Confu&s;ions of the Civil Wars in <HI>England,</HI> the Trade of the Woollen Manufa|cture was flouri&s;hing and prodigious great. Even during the Time of the Siege of <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> when that Town was, as it was called then, in open Rebellion; the Nece&s;&s;ity of Trade obliged the Be&s;iegers to give the Towns-People Leave to bring out their Bays to <HI>Lexden</HI> Heath, and to &s;ell them to the <HI>London</HI> Merchants, who came thither to buy; and the Sel|lers were allowed to carry back their Money unmole&s;ted by
<PB N="31" REF="36">
the Soldiers who be&s;ieged them. The Rea&s;on was plain; the Demand from abroad made it nece&s;&s;ary the Merchants &s;hould be &s;upplyed, and the Trade ought not to be ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>Nay &s;uch was the Con&s;umption of the Woollen Manufa|cture abroad, that all the Encrea&s;e of it at home was not &s;uf|ficient; but the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> encourag'd by the Merchants, and ha|ving Plenty of Wool, feel into the Making Part, and in a few Years Peace being re&s;tor'd in that Kingdom, and the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Inhabitants multiplying, the Woollen Manufacture came (by the Indu&s;try of People) to be as great there, in Propor|tion, as it was here.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> about this time encreas'd in People, and flouri&s;hing in Peace under the pro&s;perous Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII, and the exqui&s;ite Admini&s;tration of the great <HI>Richlieu,</HI> began to ex|tend their Trade; and the Demand they made of our Manufa|cture in that Reign, was prodigious great.</P>
<P>But here we mu&s;t make a full Point, and look a little into the Trade as in a State of full Perfection, and &s;tanding for &s;ome time at a Stay.</P>
<P>That <HI>Great Britain</HI> grew immen&s;ly Rich in tho&s;e Ages of Trade, is not to be deny'd, or indeed di&s;puted; we might give a long Account of the Encrea&s;e of her Wealth and Riches, her Greatne&s;s and Glory, and how it was all rais'd by, and the Effect of, her encreas'd Commerce; but it is too long for a Tract of this Nature, it will be &s;een in its Con&s;e|quences, and in nothing more than in the prodigions Efforts made by the whole Nation, in the late double War, from the <HI>Revolution</HI> to the Peace of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> in which, let but the im|men&s;e Sums of Money which were rais'd upon Trade only be taken Account of, and they will give us a fair Sketch of the Improvement it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Nay, let the va&s;t Sums rais'd Annually, to this Day, by the Cu&s;toms upon Trade, &s;peak &s;omething of the Encrea&s;e of it &s;ince tho&s;e Days. I need not enter into the Detail of tho&s;e Productions, &s;uch as the Duties on Wines, Tobacco, Brandies; <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> and <HI>Turkey</HI> Importations; the Exci&s;es on Beer, Ale, Malt, Spirits, Coffee, Tea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which at this time rai&s;e &s;uch Sums, as no Nation in the World can &s;how the like of, and as this Nation never came up to be|fore.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the Ab&s;tract of it with this &s;hort Return of the late King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV, to the Account of the la&s;t Year's State of the War in <HI>England;</HI> when he &s;aw the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, and the Provi&s;ion made by the Parliament for the old unprovided-for Debts, and for the Service of the grow|ing

Year, both which amounted to near Eleven Millions <HI>Ster|ling,</HI> a Sum &s;o frightful, put into <HI>French</HI> Money, that the King upon &s;ight of it, &s;pread out his Hands, and &s;aid, <HI>I &s;ee</HI> 'tis time <HI>to put an End to the War! I never believ'd that</HI> En|gland <HI>could have made &s;uch Efforts as the&s;e; let us make Peace upon the be&s;t Terms we can.</HI></P>
<P>But I come in the next Place to the declining Part of our Trade, and to enquire where it began.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. How and when the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures began to re|ceive &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion from the Influence of other Na|tions: And how they began to &s;uffer any Le&s;&s;ening or Lo&s;s from tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion which the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce felt up|on the Greatne&s;s of her Trade, and e&s;pecially upon her Manufacture, was from <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>It was in the latter end of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, that <HI>England</HI> driving &s;uch an encouraging Commerce in the Ex|port of her Woollen Manufactures, the Gain of it animated the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Merchants not only to Export the like from <HI>Ire|land,</HI> but to encourage the People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well the <HI>Na|tives</HI> as the <HI>Engli&s;h Iri&s;h</HI> (&s;o they call the Families ri&s;en up there from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Race) to pu&s;h into it, and to &s;et up the Working all manner of Woollen Goods made in <HI>England,</HI> after the &s;ame Manner, and under the &s;ame Denominations as in <HI>England;</HI> with this Addition, that they &s;oon found them|&s;elves able not only to do it as well as in <HI>England,</HI> the Wool and the Workman&s;hip being as it were) the &s;ame; but that they were able to Make, Fini&s;h, Export, and con&s;equently Sell at Market the &s;ame Goods, as good, and much cheaper, than the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Di&s;covery of this in <HI>England</HI> &s;eem'd to be from <HI>France,</HI> and from <HI>Spain,</HI> where our Merchants, to their great Mortification, fir&s;t &s;ound them&s;elves under-&s;old in the Mar|kets; Goods of the &s;ame Fabrick, of the like Weight, Good|ne&s;s, Value and Colour, being afforded much cheaper than from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This was an Affliction in Trade, and a very great Di&s;ap|pointment to the Merchants; and, in its Turn, to the Factors,
<PB N="33" REF="38">
and to the Manufacturers in the Country; for <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Our Goods at the &s;everal Markets in <HI>France</HI> lay un&s;old; expected Orders were &s;top'd and interrupted; the Merchants in <HI>France</HI> wrote to <HI>Ireland</HI> for the Goods, the Markets were &s;upplyed, and our Trade in a word decay'd.</P>
<P>It was not long &s;o here, but we began to find the &s;ame in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and at <HI>Cadiz</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and at other Markets, as at <HI>Leghorn, Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and the principal Ports of <HI>Italy;</HI> and thus it was going on to be, in all other Parts of the World.</P>
<P>But this was not all; Misfortunes &s;eldom come alone; one Evil generally follows in the Neck of another. About this time Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> that great and &s;ucce&s;sful Manager of the <HI>French</HI> Commerce, after having (with a mo&s;t happy and wonderful Advantage) put all the Southern Provinces of <HI>France</HI> upon the planting Mulberry Trees, and rai&s;ing of Silk; obliging every Town and Village in the great Pro|vinces of <HI>Languedock, Provence, Dauphine,</HI> and the adjacent Countries, to plant a proportion'd Number of Mulberry Trees for the nouri&s;hing Silk-worms, and by that means to e&s;tabli&s;h a Fund for the Silk; he contrived the like, as far as in him lay, for the Wool.</P>
<P>But finding it impo&s;&s;ible to form a Production of Wool in <HI>France</HI> (tho' he got over Sheep from <HI>England,</HI> from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from <HI>Scotland</HI>) and that he could not make the Wools come on or grow there, as they did at home, he then apply'd him&s;elf to the &s;ettling Methods for getting Wool from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and e&s;pecially from <HI>Ireland;</HI> by This he immediately &s;et up large Manufactures in <HI>France,</HI> as at <HI>Rouen,</HI> at <HI>Caen,</HI> in <HI>Poictou, Guienne, Ni&s;mes,</HI> and other Places, too many to enu|merate; with this, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool, and &s;uch other Supplies as he got from remoter Places, he &s;oon advanced in his new Attempt, and made &s;everal &s;orts of Woollen Manu|factures, and this in &s;uch Quantities, and &s;o well performed, that we &s;aw <HI>France,</HI> in a few Years, able to &s;upply them&s;elves with Cloathing of their own Making, tho' not of their own Wool, and even to tran&s;port the Manufactures they wrought to other Places; where they were &s;old in the &s;ame Markets with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to our great Mortification as well as Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor was this all; but &s;o far the <HI>French</HI> proceeded, that in a few Years they &s;et up for Prohibitions, excluded our Mer|chandizes all over <HI>France,</HI> and pretended to &s;hut us out from their Markets, &s;o that we &s;hould not be allow'd to Import our Goods any more into <HI>France.</HI></P>

This was a terrible Blow to <HI>England;</HI> and had we not &s;oon after made our &s;elves Amends upon <HI>France,</HI> by Prohibiting their whole Commerce with us, particularly their Wines, Brandies, Linnen, and wrought Silks, four Articles in which it was &s;aid we took near two Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> from them <HI>per Annum,</HI> more than all the Goods that they took from us amounted to; I &s;ay, had we not done this, it mu&s;t have ru|in'd our whole Stock, by draining away &s;uch immen&s;e Sums in Ca&s;h as mu&s;t have been call'd off for the Ballance.</P>
<P>Here began the Breach between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> in Point of Commerce; and as it came with a War, it la&s;ted &s;o long, that it is not yet return'd, nor is ever likely to be: The Humour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ran off from the <HI>French</HI> Trade, neither their Wines, or their Brandies, or their wrought Silks, have ever come into U&s;e again here, and perhaps would never do &s;o again, tho' the Trade were to be open'd; at lea&s;t, it would not as it did before: Our Ta&s;te is chang'd as to their Wines; our Fa&s;hions and Modes are chang'd as to their Silks; and the whole Vein of their Trade is turn'd (here in <HI>England</HI>) &s;o as never to return into the old Channel again, no, tho' the Trade &s;hould be laid open, which yet it is not.</P>
<P>But &s;till this was a Blow to our Manufactures, and le&s;&s;en'd the Con&s;umption of them abroad, and con&s;equently the Ex|portation of them at home; the Effect of which was, that un|le&s;s &s;ome new Vent of the &s;aid Manufactures was found out abroad, there would of nece&s;&s;ity be a Stop, and &s;ome Hands mu&s;t be taken off at home; the Quantity mu&s;t abate as the Con&s;umption abated, or el&s;e the Markets abroad would be glutted with Goods, and the Makers at home not be able to put them off; the&s;e mu&s;t leave off making, or be undone; and if they left off Making, the Poor (at lea&s;t &s;o far) would be undone: for all Abatement or Declining of the Manu|facture, is a degree of Ruin to the People.</P>
<P>To remedy this, Prudent Heads found out one immediate Help, tho' it was (in its kind) what we may call a De&s;perate Cure, namely, a Cure by Amputation; it was indeed cutting off a Member, a va&s;t and important Member of our Manu|facture, <HI>viz. Ireland:</HI> The Ca&s;e was thus:</P>
<P>It was found that <HI>Ireland</HI> began to encroach, in a very dan|gerous manner, on our Manufacture, by running into every Branch of it, making every &s;ort of Goods there, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made at home, and that in &s;o great a Quantity, that they not only &s;upplyed their own Nation, and &s;ent over great Quantities hither, but that, <HI>as before,</HI> they fill'd foreign Mar|kets with them, and even under-&s;old us abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="40">
Upon this, and con&s;idering the Abatement of the Con|&s;umption by Prohibitions abroad, two Acts were pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> for the Encouragement of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufa|ctures.</P>
<P N="1">1 An Act to take off the Duty of Tonnage and Poun|dage, paid here upon the Exportation of the Woollen Manu|facture, which being about <HI>5 per Cent</HI> upon the Value, was con&s;iderable, and was done in order to bring down our Ma|nufactures at foreign Markets, &s;o as not to be under-&s;old by the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch;</HI> which Act continues in Force, and all our Manufactures are Exported free, to this Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. An Act to Prohibit the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures be|ing Exported to any Parts or Places beyond the Seas. This was indeed a terrible Blow to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Merchants, and to the Manufacturers in that Kingdom; but there was no Remedy: it was apparent, that if the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were &s;uffered to go on, they would reduce the Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> to nothing; as well by their Cheapne&s;s, as by their irregular Working, being bound to no Laws or Rules, to no Lengths or Breadths, or other &s;uch Limitations as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are bound by.</P>
<P>It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s, not have I Room here, to enter into the Rea&s;ons or Arguments made u&s;e of on one Side or other, at that time; 'tis enough to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, that &s;o it was, and that <HI>England</HI> found her &s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of taking that Step with <HI>Ireland,</HI> however Hard or Severe it might &s;eem to be.</P>
<P>Nor can I enter into an Account of the Linnen Trade, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on this Occa&s;ion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with the &s;everal Encouragements given to it in the late King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, being as a kind of Equivalent to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> for the heavy Article above, and which is &s;ince that grown up to an unex|pected Height there, and by particular Encouragements in <HI>England,</HI> is become much more of an Equivalent than was e|ven at fir&s;t hoped for; but that is not our pre&s;ent Enquiry; I return to the Ca&s;e before me.</P>
<P>This Stop of the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was a &s;en&s;ible Relief to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, and for a while the Manufactures flouri&s;h'd again; and tho' the <HI>French</HI> encroach'd (in a &s;urprizing manner) upon us in &s;ome foreign Markets, yet there were &s;ome particular Articles which en|creas'd our Con&s;umption too very con&s;iderably, and the&s;e ought to be mention'd, becau&s;e I mu&s;t do Ju&s;tice as I go, and let it be fairly &s;een where our Manufacture found &s;ome Helps, as well as where it felt its Decay; where it was reliev'd, as well as where it was wounded and hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41">
Be&s;ides this violent Step for the Relief of the Manufacture, it had had three Additions or Encrea&s;es in the ordinary way of Commerce, which were exceeding great, and which in their Turn greatly encouraged the People, and &s;upported the Thing as a Manufacture or Employment.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Trade to <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Encrea&s;e of which has been &s;o &s;urprizing great, and began to be &s;o about the beginning of the fir&s;t War, that it was apparent in the Second War the Export of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures to <HI>Portugal,</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> was greater than the whole Export to <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> to|gether was before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Trade to <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> which by the Conque&s;ts of the late <HI>Czar</HI> in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> his building the Port of <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> his altering the Habits and Cloaths of all his People, and &s;e|veral other Encouragements given by him to Trade in Ge|neral, and to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce in Particular, opened a new Door to the Con&s;umption of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture, where there was none before.</P>
<P N="3">3. The extraordinary Trade to <HI>Jamaica</HI> By what Ways and Means our Merchants found it practicable to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a Commerce, it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cribe; but this is certain, that during that War our Trade to <HI>Jamaica</HI> was &s;uch, that the Number of Ships u&s;ing that Trade was encrea&s;ed to more than four times what they were in a few Years before the War; and that this Trade has continued to this time, or 'till within a very little while <HI>(viz.)</HI> 'till the <HI>Spani&s;h Guard de Co|&s;ta's,</HI> or crui&s;ing Ships of War, took upon them to keep a bet|ter Lock-out than formerly, and interrupt it. Whether this Trade was ju&s;tifiable by the Terms of the Treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> or not, is not to the pur|po&s;e in this Place. I may perhaps grant it was not: But 'tis the Fact, not the Legality of it, that I am now Enquiring a|bout, and in that Part I am &s;ure of being right.</P>
<P>The&s;e three Articles of Commerce may be allowed to make a great Addition to the Con&s;umption of the Woollen Ma|nufacture of <HI>England,</HI> and by the&s;e Helps, the Lo&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> Trade was for &s;ome Years the le&s;s felt, if perhaps at all.</P>
<P>And that I may give a full Latitude to this Part of our Di&s;cour&s;e, I may add, for the take of the Argument only, that &s;everal other Branches of our Exportation &s;eemed to have been encrea&s;ed in the &s;ame Space <HI>(viz.)</HI> the la&s;t thirty or forty Years, and that not in a trifling manner, but very con&s;iderably; particularly to <HI>Legborn,</HI> the Trade of that Port being exceeding|ly advanced during the various Turns among the neighbour|ing
<PB N="37" REF="42">
Powers, and particularly occa&s;ioned by the late Convul|&s;ions in <HI>Spain, Naples, Sicily,</HI> and that were in <HI>Piemont</HI> and <HI>Milan,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Lombardy;</HI> al&s;o by &s;ome Improve|ments among the <HI>Italians,</HI> which we are not particularly Judges of: Be it which way it will, 'tis evident the Expor|tations of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures to <HI>Leghorn</HI> are more than double to what they formerly were.</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance like wi&s;e in the End ca&s;e of our own Co|lonies, which is very con&s;iderable in the la&s;t thirty or forty Years, as may be proved in many particular Circum|&s;tances in their Trade, and e&s;pecially by the Export of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures thither, which is the Point I am upon, and which is manife&s;tly encrea&s;ed, as well to <HI>New England,</HI> and to <HI>Virginia,</HI> as to <HI>Carolina</HI> in particular, and to other Places.</P>
<P>But I need not enlarge upon the&s;e things; for were the En|crea&s;e of the&s;e foreign Con&s;umptions much greater than it is, and were the Places, where that Encrea&s;e has been, five times larger than they are, the declining State of the Manufacture would &s;till be made out, from other oppo&s;ite Circum&s;tances, too evident to be denied, and too &s;trong to be balanced by tho&s;e Advances.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the unrea&s;onable Encrea&s;e of the Quantity made is to be con&s;ider'd, the growing Condition of the Manufacture it &s;elf, in which we may venture to &s;ay there are &s;ome Circum|&s;tances that not only will not be equall'd by any Addition of Commerce either abroad or at home; but, to &s;peak boldly to it, would not be equall'd, if all the Nations to whom our Manufacture is exported, were to encrea&s;e the Con&s;umption of it in proportion to that of <HI>Portugal</HI> or <HI>Legborn,</HI> as above.</P>
<P>It is evident our Manufacture is encrea&s;ed to a Degree al|mo&s;t inexplicable, in&s;omuch that it is in it&s;elf too great for the Con&s;umption of all <HI>Europe.</HI> Now it &s;eems a little of a Paradox that I &s;hould bring the Encrea&s;e of the Quantity as an Argument to prove the declining of the Manufacture that is encrea&s;ed: But a little Reflection will &s;et that Part to rights in your Thoughts, and the Difficulty will immediately vani&s;h.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the Manufactures as Declined, we are not &s;peaking of the Quantity made, but of the Quantity &s;old; or it you will, we mu&s;t change the Terms, and di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the Woollen Manufacture as a Work or Fabricature, and as a Trade. There may be as many G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ods made in <HI>England</HI> as ever, but if there are not as many told as ever, the Trade will be allowed to decline; nay, the more there is made, the more
<PB N="38" REF="43">
the Manufacture is declined if they cannot be &s;old, becau&s;e the Quantity becomes a Grievance to it &s;elf.</P>
<P>If it be apparent that the Quantity made, encrea&s;es fa&s;ter than the Quantity &s;old off, or that there is more made than can be &s;old, the Manufacture is under evident Di&s;courage|ment. On the other hand, if there are more made and le&s;s &s;old, that Di&s;couragement encrea&s;es to a Di&s;traction; the Manufacture langui&s;hes, and is in a kind of Drop&s;y, where the Repletion exceeding the Evacuation, the Body &s;wells in Bulk, but declines in Strength, and dies of the wor&s;t kind of Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion but that upon the apparent Encrea&s;e of the Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI> during tho&s;e many Years mentioned in particular as above, the great Advantage made by that Trade, and the va&s;t E&s;tates acquired even by the Ma|nufacturers them&s;elves in their ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s, encouraged others to fall into it, and even encouraged tho&s;e that were in it to enlarge their Bu&s;ine&s;s, to launch out as their Stocks encrea&s;ed, farther and farther, into that Trade.</P>
<P>This Humour continues to this day, and is now become the great Grievance of the Manufacture in general; and will, if not timely prevented, be ruinous to the Trade in the End, as I &s;hall make appear in its Place.</P>
<P>While the Manufacture was in its full Extent abroad, while it was the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World in Trade, had no Rivals, and no Attempts were made to mimick it, or imitate it, but that it had an uninterrupted Sale abroad; the Encrea&s;e of the Quantity at home was far from being a Grievance, either to the Country or to the Trade; and during the happy Years of its thus currently going off, va&s;t Additions to the Quantity were made at home, &s;uch, as if you will give Credit to &s;ome People, would in a few Years have glutted the whole World with our Goods, tho' there had been no Check given to the Vent of it abroad.</P>
<P>I could give a long Hi&s;tory of the Encrea&s;e of the Manu|facture in <HI>England,</HI> I mean, as a Work or Fabrick; even whole Towns, nay, Parts of Counties, have, within the Me|mory of &s;ome &s;till alive, been employed in it, who were ne|ver employed before.</P>
<P>I could likewi&s;e enter into the Detail of the Changes and Turns which the Manufacture it&s;elf has &s;uffered by changing the Kinds, as particularly the changing the Clothing or Cloth|making into the making narrow and lighter Kinds of Cloth, &s;uch as we call Druggets and Ket&s;ies, in&s;tead of Broad-cloth,
<PB N="39" REF="44">
in the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as the Counties of <HI>Wilts, Berks,</HI> and <HI>Devon;</HI> and Sagathies and Duroys, a thin and light &s;ort of Stuff, in&s;tead of thick Cloth-Serges, at <HI>Taunton</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and other Parts adjoining; by which Exchange of Kinds, it is the Opinion of many Men of Judg|ment, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture in general has &s;uffered ex|tremely, and a Door opened to the Attempts of Foreigners, who encroached upon us by tho&s;e Imitutions and Delu&s;ions, but were not able to come up to us in the e&s;&s;ential Part of the Manufacture <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Clothing Part. The Ca&s;e was thus:</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> were the fir&s;t who, as I have &s;aid, &s;et up to rival our Manufactures, and having gotten Workmen as well as Materials from <HI>England,</HI> they &s;et up a Cloathing Manufa|cture as well at <HI>Rouen</HI> and <HI>Caen</HI> and other Places in <HI>Norman|dy,</HI> as at <HI>Ni&s;mes</HI> and the adjacent Cities in <HI>Languedock</HI> and <HI>Provence.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>French</HI> (according to the known &s;uperficial Humour of that Nation) contenting them&s;elves with keeping up to the Standard of Broad Cloth in <HI>Languedoc</HI> only; becau&s;e they were oblig'd to follow the Pattern of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, for the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade; in other Places made it light, loo&s;e, and &s;pongy, thinner in Sub&s;tance, and &s;lighter in Workman|&s;hip; and this not being able to carry the Breadth of the Broad Cloth, they alter'd to the u&s;ual Stuff Breadth of half Ell, or half Yard, as their ordinary Stuffs were made.</P>
<P>The&s;e they call'd Cloths at fir&s;t; but &s;eeing they would not keep up the Credit of that Name, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth did; they gave them &s;everal Names from the Towns or Counties where they were made, &s;uch as <HI>Drap de Normandy, Drap de Berry, Drap de Lorrain,</HI> and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Had we let the <HI>French</HI> go on their own way, and kept up at home to the old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture of Broad Cloth, the <HI>French</HI> to this Day had been di&s;tanc'd in their new Attempt; but with a Weakne&s;s, never to be defended, while they with Difficulty followed us, we faced about, and &s;imply followed them.</P>
<P>They brought their Silk Stuffs, and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Druggets, and light thin <HI>French</HI> Serges, into Wear, and into Fa&s;hion; and they were in the right, becau&s;e they could make no better; We, to Ape them in their Mode, fall into the &s;ame &s;orts of Stuffs, and &s;o made that, which was their Nece&s;&s;ity, be our Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>By this Means, not only we wore their &s;orry &s;light Ma|nufactures, and even brought them privately from <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, but (fond of our own Mi&s;chiefs) we quit the Broad
<PB N="40" REF="45">
Cloth, the ancient Glory of <HI>England</HI> (as to Manufacture) and fall into the making of light Stuffs for Men's Wear, to the Ruin of our own Manufactures, as much as in us lay; for the&s;e new fooli&s;h Things neither employ'd an equal Number of Hands, or con&s;um'd an equal Quantity of the Wool, in both which they accommodated the <HI>French,</HI> who neither had at fir&s;t a Number of skilful Workmen to make them, or a Quantity of Wool to make them with; but in both we weaken'd our own Country, for this at once caus'd the Wool to lye on hand unwrought, and thou&s;ands of Poor to go unemploy'd.</P>
<P>The great Promoter of this Debauchery in Trade (for &s;uch it might be call'd) was one <HI>D'Oyly,</HI> a Warehou&s;e-Keeper in <HI>London,</HI> who, valuing him&s;elf upon that for which he ought (according to the Laws of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>) to have his Name be made infamous, and his Hou&s;e be made a Dunghil, boa&s;ted of his Merit, and call'd his new <HI>French</HI> Mimickry of a Manu|facture, <HI>Doyly</HI>'s <HI>Stuffs;</HI> and &s;uch was the Vanity of the Day, that we &s;aw the whole Town, nay, we might &s;ay the whole Nation, run into them, and the ancient Manufacture of Broad Cloth lay by the Walls; the &s;ub&s;tantial Woollen-Drapers had nothing to do, no Trade at their Shops; and the new Stuff-Merchant <HI>D'Oyly</HI> had his great Ware-hou&s;e near <HI>Exeter-Exchange</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> throng'd with Buyers from Morning to Night, and the Man got an E&s;tate in one Sum|mer's Trade.</P>
<P>It is true, God, and a hard Winter, &s;hould have the Thanks of the poor Manufacturers, while they live; the Severity of the great Fro&s;t (falling in immediately upon it) brought the good warm cloathing Trade into Mode again, and &s;et the Poor at work in &s;ome tolerable Degree, &s;o at lea&s;t as to re|lieve them for that time.</P>
<P>But this unhappy Humour reviv'd &s;o far, as brought our Manufacturers into the way of making a middle Kind, be|tween Cloth and Stuff, &s;o as on one Side to &s;uit the Cli|mate, and yet (as near as might be) on the other, to follow the <HI>French</HI> Folly al&s;o, and this introduc'd the making Drug|gets, Sagathies, Chamlets, Duroys, and the &s;everal kinds of Men's Stuffs, with which we have (as it were) made War with our own Manufacture, and jo&s;tled the Broad Cloth as much as we could out of the World; &s;o that in &s;hort, if tho&s;e light things which the <HI>French</HI> made, becau&s;e they could make no better, did not become the univer&s;al Mode of our Coun|try, and the better and more important Cloathing, on which the whole Nation depended, go quite out of u&s;e, it was none of our Fault.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="46">
The Truth is, tho' the fir&s;t Madne&s;s wore off, and the <HI>D'Oyly</HI> Stuffs in a little time did &s;icken and glut the Town, yet This is certain that the wearing of Drugget and Stuffs, Chamlets and Duroys, and &s;uch-like &s;light things, was a ter|rible Blow to the antient Clothing Manufacture; to this Day it has not recovered it, and perhaps never will.</P>
<P>Thus far the Manufacture declined by our Own Folly: It is true indeed that the&s;e &s;light thin Stuffs, tho' they did not con&s;ume &s;o much Wool, or employ &s;o many Hands as the Clothing, yet, as they &s;ent the People oftner to Market, the Quantity made &s;eemed to be &s;ome Amends to the Manufa|cture, and to the Poor; But then, they opened a Door to the <HI>French</HI> to &s;ell their &s;light, half-made Goods at foreign Mar|kets; for the Fa&s;hion al&s;o took Root, whereas (if the Manu|facture of Broad-cloth had been kept up) the <HI>French</HI> would never have been able to have hurt us, at home or abroad.</P>
<P>But this is not all; I &s;hall give you a farther Account of the Declining of the Manufacture in its Sale abroad, and of the Rea&s;ons of it in particular, more ruinous than this. But here I mu&s;t take notice too, as I have &s;aid above, how the Making encrea&s;ed, whether the Sale encrea&s;ed or no; and this we &s;hall give you &s;ome unan&s;werable Evidence of in a few Ex|amples.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Upon this unhappy falling into the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion of wearing Stuffs in&s;tead of Broad-cloth, I mean for the Mens Wear, a &s;trange and &s;udden Metamorpho&s;is in Trade follow|ed here in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spittlefields</HI> had been eminent for many Years for the Silk Manufacture, encouraged and greatly encrea&s;ed by the coming over of the <HI>French</HI> Refugees in 1682 to 1684, and the Num|bers of People encrea&s;ing there, the Buildings likewi&s;e en|crea&s;ed; &s;o that what with Ribband-Weavers and Broad-Weavers, it was generally &s;aid there was an hundred thou|&s;and Weavers in <HI>Spittlefields</HI> and the adjacent Streets.</P>
<P>But the Trade was not equal to the Numbers of the People, the Streets began to be de&s;olate, the Hou&s;es empty, and the People &s;hifted about to other Places and to other Employ|ments, as Occa&s;ion &s;upply'd them; when all on a &s;udden, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to find Wool-combers and Staplers &s;etting up in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI> and Shops began to open there for Wor&s;ted Yarn and for comb'd Wool, and abundance (of the <HI>French</HI> Women e&s;pecially) went &s;pinning about the Streets. This was employed at fir&s;t among the Stocking-Weavers or Frame-work-Knitters, which Manufacture, about that time, took a new Turn all over <HI>England,</HI> from Knitting to Weaving or <HI>Frame|making</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="47">
to the great Lo&s;s of the Poor in the Countries where tho&s;e Goods were u&s;ually made, where many thou&s;ands were formerly employed in Knitting, but now were quite &s;truck out of the Work by the Gro&s;s of the Stockings being wrought in the Frame.</P>
<P>This began the Woollen Trade in <HI>Spittlefields;</HI> but when the <HI>D'Oyly Stuffs</HI> had, as I have &s;aid above, &s;pread the Town, and the Humour continued for &s;ome time, <HI>Spittle|fields</HI> took another new Turn, and in one Year more we &s;aw it as full of Stuff and Wor&s;ted as before of Silk, the Silk-Weavers turned their Hands to the narrow Woollen Manufactures, and the Quantity of tho&s;e Manufactures now made there of almo&s;t all Kinds, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were for|merly made at <HI>Norwich</HI> and the Parts adjacent, is &s;uch, that in a word, <HI>Spittlefields</HI> is become the principal Seat or Center of tho&s;e Manufactures in <HI>England;</HI> and yet the City of <HI>Nor|wich,</HI> as above, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in as full Employ as ever, or at lea&s;t as u&s;ual; &s;o that this whole Manufacture of <HI>Spittle|fields</HI> is an Encrea&s;e upon the Manufacture in general, and mu&s;t be an&s;wered for by a proportioned Sale &s;omewhere or other, abroad or at home, or el&s;e &s;o far the Encrea&s;e is too great for the Con&s;umption, and is not a Benefit but a Lo&s;s to the Manufacture, and adds in the wor&s;t manner to its decli|ning Circum&s;tances.</P>

of the Town of <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> and by that they were &s;ure to know of what Value the Goods were, and were certain to find them an&s;wer both in Lengths and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the Neighbouring Towns finding the <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Bocking</HI> Bay-makers grow rich, thru&s;t them&s;elves into that Trade, and now the Bayes are made at <HI>Cogge&s;hal,</HI> at <HI>Witham,</HI> at <HI>Kelvedon,</HI> at <HI>Braintre,</HI> at <HI>Hal&s;ted,</HI> and in a word, at almo&s;t all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Towns in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> beyond <HI>Cbelms|ford.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all, but even the Bay-makers them&s;elves, upon the lea&s;t Start of the Trade, and upon any &s;udden quick Demand from abroad, pu&s;h in with &s;uch Eagerne&s;s, and en|crea&s;e their Quantity to &s;uch a Degree, that they bring more to the Market than all the World can take off.</P>
<P>This has, I may &s;ay, ruin'd the Trade; and the Con&s;equence is, that as &s;oon as ever that &s;mall Run is over, and the De|mand from abroad cea&s;es, the Market is immediately throng'd with Goods, they are pawned and pledged to every monied Man in the Place, 'till they can be put off; the Price &s;inks, the Labour of the Poor &s;tops, and the Bay-makers are often broke and undone.</P>
<P>Nor is the Credit or real Value of the Goods &s;upported, for the Bay-makers being now extended over the whole Coun|try, and working out of the Juri&s;diction of the Bay-Hall at <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> they put what Goods they plea&s;e upon the Mar|ket, and what Marks or Seals they plea&s;e upon the Goods; &s;o that the Credit of the Manufacture is &s;unk, and no Man tru&s;ts to the Seals of the Goods any more, but takes Care to look into the Goods him&s;elf, and &s;ee with his own Eyes that he is not cheated.</P>
<P>I cannot but e&s;teem this la&s;t to be one eminent De|gree of the Declining of that Manufacture; for if once a Manu|facture declines in its Credit, I &s;hall always conclude it is declin'd in its Sale, or will &s;oon be &s;o; <HI>but that by the way.</HI> The pre&s;ent Article I am upon, and which I lay the whole Stre&s;s of the Que&s;tion now upon, is the Encrea&s;e of the Quantity beyond the Demand; that more are made than are or can be con&s;umed, which I think is apparent in many other Particulars.</P>
<P>I &s;um the whole Ob&s;ervation up in this one Head <HI>(viz.)</HI> that this very Encrea&s;e is a Grievance, which in the end may be ruinous to the whole Woollen Manufacture of <HI>England,</HI> if &s;ome new Doors of Commerce are not opened abroad to rai&s;e a Con&s;umption equal to that Encrea&s;e, or &s;ome Method

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the real Cau&s;es of the Decay of our Manufacture; ari&s;ing partly from Prohibitions abroad, but chiefly from our refu&s;ing the Wear of it at Home; and &s;omething offered for the Remedy.</HEAD>
<P>BUT 'tis needful now to enquire into the State of our Manufacture abroad, as to the Con&s;umption of the &s;eve|ral Species in tho&s;e Countries where our Trade u&s;ed to be &s;ettled: If we find the Sale or Demand encrea&s;ing abroad, the encrea&s;ing of the Quantity at home would certainly be &s;o far from a Grievance, that it would be the Glory and Pro|&s;perity of our Commerce and of our Country; and if every County in <HI>England</HI> were as fully employed in manufacturing, as <HI>Wilt&s;hire, Devon&s;hire, Norfolk</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> every City as <HI>Nor|wich</HI> and <HI>Exeter,</HI> and every Market Town, as <HI>Froom, Taun|ton, Leeds,</HI> or <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> it would be the Wealth of the whole, and the greate&s;t Felicity that this World ever pro|duced to a Nation.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e is not &s;o, but far otherwi&s;e; in&s;tead of the Con&s;umption encrea&s;ing abroad, in&s;tead of a larger Demand, we &s;ee all Parts of the World envying us, mo&s;t Parts endea|vouring to imitate us, and as many as can encouraging their own up&s;tart Manufactures in the room of the <HI>Briti&s;h;</HI> and too many totally prohibiting the Sale or the wearing our Manu|factures, that their own, however mean and ordinary, may take Place.</P>
<P>And not to dwell upon &s;ome late Prohibitions of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Woollen Goods in <HI>Spain</HI> and in the I&s;land of <HI>Sicily,</HI> at <HI>Lintz, Pa&s;&s;au, Vienna,</HI> and other Places in the Emperor's Do|minions, done rather by way of In&s;ult to our Nation at this Cri&s;is of their Affairs, than that they are able to carry on any E|quivalent Manufactures of their own; I &s;ay, not to lay any Stre&s;s upon the&s;e, yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that other Places have of late Years attempted our Manufacture, and &s;ome but with too much Succe&s;s, and Prohibitions rather natural and con&s;e|quential, than political, encrea&s;e upon us every Day.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="50">
It is the general Opinion (and I have joyn'd with it in Part, in the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e) that there is no Wool to be found in any Part of the World, or at lea&s;t not in <HI>Europe,</HI> capable of working into &s;uch Manufactures, and of making &s;uch &s;everal Sorts of Goods, as we at pre|&s;ent furni&s;h the World with; and upon this very Principle we carry our Boa&s;ts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture &s;o high: Now in &s;ome particular Things we are right; I mean, right in our Judgment, namely, that the World has not the Wool, that is, has not any Wool capable of working into &s;uch Ma|nufactures as we make; tho' as to Boa&s;ting, as we do, I &s;hall never come into that Part, becau&s;e boa&s;ting of our Superiority is but firing the re&s;t of the World with an un|wearyed Application to &s;upply the Defect.</P>
<P>But let us di&s;tingui&s;h here with a little more Temper than we u&s;ually do; There is a manife&s;t Difference between having no Wool fit for any Manufacture at all, and not having the be&s;t and the fine&s;t Wool, of the longe&s;t Staple, the firme&s;t Bo|dy, and the fine&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t Quality: There is a manife&s;t Difference between the Wool being good for nothing, and be|ing not &s;o good as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wool. To de&s;cend to Particulars;</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Europe,</HI> take it BY and LARGE (as we expre&s;s it) from End to End, does not produce a Wool capable of making our fine Broad Cloths of <HI>Warmin&s;ter, Trowbridge, Bradford,</HI> and <HI>Froom;</HI> or our fine <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Whites; no nor perhaps &s;uch as our <HI>Wakefield</HI> and <HI>Leeds</HI> Cloth, tho' what we call coar&s;e, yet of Sub&s;tance and Weight inimitable; nor of many &s;everal Manufactures of o|ther Kinds, &s;uch as <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Ker&s;ies, <HI>Exeter</HI> and <HI>Taunton</HI> Serges, <HI>Devizes</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Druggets, <HI>Andover</HI> and <HI>Newberry</HI> Shaloons, and the like.</P>
<P>But to &s;ay therefore, that there are no other of our Ma|nufactures that can be made abroad, and that even where they have no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool, that I cannot and mu&s;t not grant, becau&s;e Experience teaches us the contrary every Day, to our great Di&s;advantage in Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Saxony,</HI> a large and fertile Country in <HI>Germany,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding the Severity of the Winters, which are &s;ometimes &s;uch as gives a Check to the Production of Wool, yet not only has a very good kind of Wool, but a very large Quan|tity of it; and the <HI>Saxons,</HI> an indu&s;trious People, are alrea|dy advanc'd &s;o far in the Manufacturing the Wool, that they make two particular Manufactures which are very

u&s;eful in tho&s;e cold Countries, and which they formerly bought from <HI>England,</HI> either brought thither to their Fair at <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> by way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">burgh,</HI> or bought at the great Mart at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> and carried over Land to the <HI>Elb,</HI> at <HI>Magdeburgb;</HI> the&s;e were <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Bayes and <HI>Welch</HI> Flan|nels.</P>
<P>Every one knows, that as the&s;e Goods are &s;oft and warm, and are &s;uited very particularly for pre&s;erving the Bodies of tho&s;e who wear them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Northern Parts of the World from the Severity of the Cold, &s;o they are not made of the coar&s;e&s;t and har&s;he&s;t of the Wool; on the contrary, they are made thick and downy, well mill'd, and the Nap rai&s;ed, which would not be, if the Wool was not fine and &s;oft, and the Workman&s;hip clo&s;e and thick.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e they now make in <HI>Saxony,</HI> not only in &s;ufficient Quantities to &s;upply them&s;elves, and their own Markets, but we &s;ee the Flannels and Bayes of <HI>Saxony</HI> &s;old every Year at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> at <HI>Nurembergh,</HI> and mo&s;t of the other Fairs of Note in the Upper <HI>Germany;</HI> and what is the Con&s;equence of this? Not any Prohibition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bays and Flan|nels; no; we may &s;end ours thither al&s;o, and may &s;ell them there too, if we can; but Nature forbids it, the Thing is a Prohibition of it &s;elf; ours are not &s;old there, becau&s;e their own are &s;ufficient, and we need not &s;ay, are cheaper, for it would be very hard, if they can be made at all, that they &s;hould not be made cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which pa&s;s thro' &s;o many Hands, &s;o many Countries, pay &s;o many Embarkations, A&s;&s;urances, Commi&s;&s;ions, and other Charges, and are carried &s;o far, as well by Land as Water-Carriage.</P>
<P>It is true, the Wool of <HI>Saxony</HI> is of a brown, or a kind of Ru&s;&s;et Colour, occa&s;ion'd by the Climate, or the parti|cular Breed of the Sheep, or from what&s;oever other Inci|dent in Nature we cannot account for; but as the Bayes are generally Dyed, and many of the Flannels al&s;o, it is not di&s;tingui&s;h'd, for that the Wool, however Ru&s;&s;et, or of a Greyi&s;h Colour at fir&s;t, and as it grows on the Sheep's Back, yet it is not at all the wor&s;e to take any Co|lour, in the Dying-fat, but (as &s;ome think) is rather the better.</P>
<P>I need go no farther for the Proof of this, than to appeal to tho&s;e Merchants, who trading to tho&s;e Countries, u&s;ual|ly had Commi&s;&s;ions from thence to buy great Quantities of tho&s;e Goods here; and let Them tell us how many
<PB N="47" REF="52">
Bayes or Flannels they now have Orders for, for the Fair at <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> or the Mart at <HI>Frankfurt;</HI> or rather, whe|ther any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bayes and Flannels are &s;ent thither, or no.</P>
<P>But this is not all: Let us look in the next Place into the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s Dominions, I mean that Part of his Coun|try which was formerly call'd the Electorate of <HI>Branden|burgh,</HI> the Country about <HI>Magdeburgh,</HI> the Country upon the <HI>Havel</HI> and the <HI>Sprhee;</HI> there they have Wool, which, tho' coar&s;e and har&s;h, yet the Government of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> care|ful to improve the Country to the utmo&s;t, and to employ their own Poor for their own Work, cau&s;es all tho&s;e coar&s;er Manufactures which their own Wool is capable of making, to be made among them&s;elves; and tho' the&s;e Ma|nufactures are not equal to the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> yet as they are &s;uf|ficient to the Demands of their own Poor, and &s;erve to cloath the Boors and Pe&s;ants, that is to &s;ay, the Country People and Plow-men, and labouring Poor, they think it rea&s;onable to Prohibit all foreign Manufactures, which u&s;u|ally were Imported for tho&s;e U&s;es; &s;uch were our <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Ker&s;ies, double and &s;ingle <HI>Do&s;ens,</HI> the coar&s;e Goods made in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Half-Thicks, Penni&s;tones, Duffiels,</HI> Blanketting, and other Woollen Manufactures made for the Cloathing and Covering of the Poor.</P>
<P>The&s;e were formerly Shipp'd off in great Quantities for <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and for <HI>Stetin</HI> and <HI>Strael&s;ond,</HI> and other Ports on the South Coa&s;t of the <HI>Baltick;</HI> but now the General Con&s;umption of &s;uch Goods has been &s;topp'd for &s;ome Years, the People making all tho&s;e Things at home.</P>
<P>It is the like in <HI>Sweden,</HI> where, tho' their Wool is &s;till coar&s;er, and the Manufactures they make the poore&s;t and roughe&s;t that can be imagined, yet the &s;etting their own Poor to work to make their own Cloathing, however mean, &s;erves to employ them, keeps their Money at home, and all &s;till &s;hortens us in our Exportations of tho&s;e Goods to that Country.</P>
<P>It is true our finer Cloths gain &s;till an Admittance into tho&s;e Countries, becau&s;e the Wool (even of <HI>Saxony</HI>) is not fine enough for &s;uch a Manufacture; and this may &s;hew us, that we have certainly been in the Wrong of it, and have weakened the Intere&s;t of our Manufactures abroad exceedingly, by leaving our Cloathing Trade to &s;ink upon our Hands, and turn our Workmen to the lighter Manufactures, which other Countries with their coar&s;e Wool are &s;o much ea&s;ier able to &s;upply. But to go on;</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="53">
So many of our Woollen Manufactures being thus exclu|ded from <HI>Sweden,</HI> from <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> from <HI>Saxony,</HI> and from &s;o many Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> let us look next towards the South; and here we find the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> of <HI>Zurick</HI> making Chamlets, Shalloons, and &s;everal other Sorts of Ma|nufactures, as well for Mens Wearing as Womens, the &s;ame as are made in <HI>Spittlefields, Norwich, Andover,</HI> and &s;everal other Places in <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> perform the&s;e Works now with much Accuracy, and it is hard to know them from the like &s;orts of Goods made in <HI>England;</HI> the Workmen al&s;o who &s;et them up being fetch'd from <HI>Spittle|fields,</HI> where they learned the Art, and how to manage both the Wool, the Yarn, the Loom, the Dre&s;&s;ing, and in a word, the whole Fini&s;hing after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manner, and (without flattering our &s;elves) as well perform'd.</P>
<P>Did the <HI>Zurickers</HI> only &s;upply their own City, or their own Canton with the&s;e Goods, the Lo&s;s to our Manufacture would be no more than the meer Negative upon their Con|&s;umption; but I &s;hould not be ju&s;t to the matter in hand, if I did not tell you, that, to the irreparable Lo&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, the&s;e Goods are brought from <HI>Zurick</HI> by the River <HI>Rhine</HI> to the City of <HI>Ba&s;le,</HI> and from thence down the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI> and then &s;till by Water up the <HI>Main</HI> to the Mart at <HI>Frankfort au Main,</HI> where they go too far in Supplanting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods of the &s;ame Denomination; and to &s;uch a Degree are they arriv'd, that I am told there are very few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods of the&s;e Sorts now &s;old there; the <HI>Zurickers</HI> &s;upplying the Fair with them, as good as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and con&s;iderably cheaper.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee our Manufacture cut &s;hort on every Side, by the Envy or Indu&s;try of the &s;everal Nations of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> totally Prohibited in <HI>France,</HI> and very much &s;upplant|ed in &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>The Emperor has for &s;ome time encouraged Manufactures in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and in all the Hereditary Countries; and the Con&s;equence of this, 'tis expected, will be a General Prohibition of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures. It has been attempted lately by way of Pique and Re&s;entment be|tween the Imperial Court and <HI>Great Britain.</HI> But that Part may be e&s;teem'd a Je&s;t, compar'd with other Countries.</P>
<P>However it may be well worth con&s;idering, whether if this general Humour of manufacturing &s;hould &s;pread far in <HI>Europe,</HI> as we are ju&s;t now told it begins to do in <HI>Poland,</HI> and in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and is threatned in <HI>Spain,</HI> what the Impre&s;&s;ion it
<PB N="49" REF="54">
may make upon our Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI> may be in a few Years.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Inva&s;ions are Increa&s;ing, &s;o our Manufacture mu&s;t be Declining in proportion, unle&s;s it could be &s;aid that &s;ome yet farther Branch of Foreign Commerce can be found out for the Con&s;umption of our Manufacture, which it is time enough to &s;peak of when we &s;ee it in Pro&s;pect, and which I &s;hould be glad to &s;ay was probable.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge if the pre&s;ent War &s;hould proceed to Extremities, &s;o as to lay open the Trade from <HI>England</HI> to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> directly, I &s;hould venture to &s;ay it would give our Manufactures a new Turn, and they would feel a Spring of Pro&s;perity for &s;ome time, and that con&s;iderably too; e&s;pecially if &s;ome Bounds were &s;et to the Manufacturers at home, el&s;e (if they launch'd out in Quantity, according to Cu&s;tom, as is mentioned above) they would glut the Market, tho' they were to have a new <HI>America</HI> opened to them for the Trade once in every five Years.</P>
<P>However, I &s;ee no room to argue upon this remote Pro|&s;pect; they that are Sanguine enough upon the War to run on making, and lay up a Stock of Goods in expectation of a Market the next Fair at <HI>Porto-Belo,</HI> or when <HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> &s;hall be turn'd <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> may go on their own way, I am for &s;haring no <HI>Bear Skins.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t come nearer home &s;till, and mu&s;t take the Freedom to in&s;i&s;t, that our Manufacture is in a State of Decay too from our Conduct at home, much more than from all Prohi|bitions and Interruptions abroad. I am not di&s;pos'd to make this Work a Satyr upon my own Country, but certainly we are the fir&s;t, if not the only Nation in the World, who ha|ving the be&s;t and mo&s;t profitable Product, and the be&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable Manufacture of our own, of any Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> if not in the World, are the mo&s;t backward to our own Improvement.</P>
<P>A Manufacture valuable in it Self, infinitely profitable to the Poor, unexceptionably plea&s;ant to the Rich; not too hot for the Summer, not too cold for the Winter; light enough for <HI>July;</HI> warm enough for <HI>December;</HI> beautiful as the fine&s;t Silks, &s;uiting with Laces, Embroidery, and all manner of Orna|ments, better than even Silk it &s;elf, and yet Ornamental and Rich in its own Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>A Manufacture receptive of the brighte&s;t and deepe&s;t Co|lours; Gay enough for the Bridegroom, Solemn enough for the Widow; Rich enough for a Coronation, Grave enough for the deepe&s;t Mourning.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="55">
A Manufacture that has not one Exception to be made a|gain&s;t it, or one Rea&s;on to be given for di&s;liking it; except the weake&s;t of all Rea&s;ons, the Love of Change and Variety, or that wicked Rea&s;on which a Man gave why he did not love his beautiful and agreeable Wife, <HI>viz.</HI> only becau&s;e &s;he was his own.</P>
<P>A Manufacture that all the World covets, envies us for, &s;trives to imitate, nay, are vain of but thinking they can imi|tate it.</P>
<P>A Manufacture which tho&s;e other Nations (when they have faintly imitated it) are obliged to Prohibit by the &s;evere&s;t Laws, or el&s;e all their People would run into them, and which they do &s;trive to come at and purcha&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;tricte&s;t Prohibitions.</P>
<P>A Manufacture which is apparently declining for want of a Con&s;umption equal to its Bulk, and becau&s;e of the too &s;ucce&s;sful Attempts of other People to &s;et it up among them|&s;elves; and becau&s;e of the Improvements that the Indu&s;try of Strangers, and the Indolence of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacturers a&s;&s;i&s;ts them in.</P>
<P>And yet with &s;uch a Manufacture as this, we cannot per|&s;uade our &s;elves to wear our own Produce, to propagate our own Indu&s;try, or employ our own People; but we are no &s;ooner Prohibited the U&s;e of one foreign Bauble, but we fly to another; fir&s;t we turn'd our Backs upon our own wrought Silks, and run to <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China</HI> for all the &s;lighte&s;t and fooli&s;he&s;t Tra&s;h in the World, &s;uch as their Chints, &s;light Silks, painted Cottons, <HI>Herba,</HI> Silk and no Silks as if any thing but our own was to be thought beautiful, and any thing but what was be&s;t for us, was to be encou|raged by us.</P>
<P>When this Extravagance was al&s;o check'd by a Law, we run then into another Extream, and &s;till turning our Fancy again&s;t our own Manufactures, on a &s;udden we &s;aw all our Women, Rich and Poor, cloath'd in Callico, printed and painted; the Gayer and the more Tawdry, the better; and though ordinary, mean, low-priz'd, and &s;oon in Rags, the gaye&s;t Ladies appeared in them on the greate&s;t Occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus the Ancient Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain</HI> were de&s;pis'd by our own People, and the Bread taken out of the Mouths of the Poor; the Hands that would have labour|ed could get no Work; the Trade &s;unk; the Manufacturers &s;larved, and the Wool lay by in heaps unwrought, and un|fold,
<PB N="51" REF="56">
to the general impoveri&s;hing of the People, and the Ruin of the Manufacture it &s;elf.</P>
<P>We are now by another Law of Prohibition re&s;trained from the wearing of painted Callicoes; and what follows? the Temper is not at all reclaim'd, nor do they &s;o much as incline to return to the U&s;e of their own Manufactures, which is the main and be&s;t End of the Prohibition: But, as if we were re&s;olv'd to run down our whole Country, and ruin our Poor with our own Hands, we run to the remote&s;t Corners for &s;ome Shift or other to cheat our &s;elves; and now we &s;ee the general Cloathing (of the meaner Peo|ple&s;pecially) runs into the meane&s;t, tawdrie&s;t Colours, &s;tamp'd upon the mo&s;t ordinary Linnen, fetch'd from <HI>Scotland, Ire|land,</HI> or indeed any where; as if any thing but our own was to be our Choice, and as if we had for&s;worn our own Ma|nufactures, and were a&s;ham'd to be dre&s;s'd in our own Cloths.</P>
<P>How &s;hall we expect our own Manufactures &s;hould grow and encrea&s;e, while this is the Ca&s;e? and if we will not encourage our own Growth, and the Labour of our own People, how &s;hould we expect Foreigners &s;hould do it?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, as I &s;aid of the Woollen Manufactures of <HI>Saxo|ny,</HI> that they are an effectual Prohibition of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o I may &s;ay of our People's running into the Wear of printed Linnens, Callicoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are a tacit Prohibition of the Manufactures; for what is a Rejecting the Manufacture by a kind of general Con&s;ent, but a Prohibition in effect? and how &s;hould the Manufacture be &s;upported, when our own People turn their Backs upon it, and when even the People that make it will hardly be per&s;waded to wear it?</P>
<P>I believe no Man will ask me, after this, how I will prove the Manufacture to be in a declining State, or what is the Rea&s;on of it; no more can they ask what Remedy is pro|per to apply to this Evil: 'Tis an unaccountable Thing in a Manufacturing Nation like this, that Men &s;hould ask what will re&s;tore the Trade, when they &s;ee &s;o evidently what has been the Ruin of it.</P>
<P>The An&s;wer is &s;hort, and (according to my Title) the Only Way to re&s;tore our Manufactures, is to WEAR THEM. The Con&s;umption at home is infinitely great: If our whole populous Nation were obliged to cloath only in their own Manufacture, we &s;hould neither complain of our &s;elves, or value the Prohibition of others.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="57">
If you will not do this (and the next Direction is as &s;hort as that) you mu&s;t abate the Quantity; and, as you Con&s;ume le&s;s, Make le&s;s; what will Encrea&s;ing the Work do for us, while we Decrea&s;e the Con&s;umption? It will in the End not only ruin the trading People, but ruin the Trade it Self: But I have not room to enlarge upon that Part here.</P>
