<SALUTE>My good Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR two daughters dined at our hou&s;e la&s;t Sunday. It gave me great plea&s;ure to &s;ee them, and to find them look &s;o well, and appear to be &s;o comfortably &s;ettled. You may be &s;ure I did not fail to make very particular enquiries after you, and very glad I was to find you had had no returns of your cough, but had been &s;trong and hearty all the winter. I was in hopes too of hear|ing that you were in your u&s;ual cheerful &s;pirits, but your girls tell me, you have long been quite mi&s;erable from your fears of the French. Mary &s;ays, you &s;it by the fire and fancy how things will be when once their army has got footing in old England, till you imagine they are really come, every time you hear any little noi&s;e or bu&s;tle; and that you are afraid of walking down the village after dark, for fear of meeting them; and that you go to bed in terror every night, le&s;t they &s;hould come and murder you before the morning.</P>
<P>My worthy old friend, I cannot but grieve that now you are placed in that happy a&s;ylum you have long wi&s;hed for, that your children are all &s;ettled to your &s;atisfaction, that you &s;hould make your&s;elf wretched with the fears of an evil which, perhaps, never may arrive. I am &s;ure you will agree with me, that we &s;hould never allow our&s;elves to be terrified without rea&s;on; let us then examine the matter a little cooly, and &s;ee what cau&s;e we have
<PB N="3" REF="3">for alarm, and what con&s;olation could be had if all you dread was really to happen.</P>
<P>You &s;hould not forget that you are above forty miles from the &s;ea, &s;o that if our enemies were to land on the neare&s;t &s;ea coa&s;t they po&s;&s;ibly could, and march immediately to your village, they &s;till could not be with you in a moment. News flies very quick you know, &s;o that they cannot well come upon you unawares, without your having had any notice that they are in the country. If there comes a party of foot &s;oldiers they cannot march &s;o quick but that there will be time for the news to &s;pread from place to place before them; and if there comes an army of hor&s;e &s;oldiers, the landing the hor&s;es mu&s;t take &s;ome time, &s;o that in this ca&s;e too, you will certainly have notice of their being landed before they can po&s;&s;ibly reach you. You &s;ee then while all continues &s;till and quiet, you may go to re&s;t in peace without any fear of being di&s;turbed; for if they do come, you need never fear but you will, one way or other, have warning beforehand. Well! you will &s;ay, but &s;uppo&s;ing they cannot take us quite by &s;ur|prize, what a&s;&s;urance have I that in a week's time they may not come and put an end to my life, or turn me out of doors to beg or to &s;tarve. I mu&s;t indeed agree with you that we are in a dangerous &s;tate. The king and the parliament by the prepa|rations they have made, &s;hew that they think we have a great deal to fear; but yet it is the opinion of many wi&s;e and &s;en&s;ible people, that there is a great rea&s;on to hope that we &s;hall beat the French fleet at &s;ea, &s;o as wholly to prevent their coming to invade us; or el&s;e that if they do make good their landing, the &s;pirit of free born Engli&s;hmen
<PB N="4" REF="4">will make them fight &s;o manfully in defence of their country and their liberties, that the enemy will never be able to make &s;laves of us, or to ad|vance far into our land. For my own part, I will confe&s;s to you, I have great hopes that by the ble&s;|&s;ing of God, the means u&s;ed for our defence will be &s;ucce&s;sful. Our danger is great I allow, but &s;hall we dare to &s;ay that we are in &s;uch a &s;tate that the Almighty cannot deliver us? You and I, my good woman, have both lived too long not to be able to call to mind many examples, both in pub|lic and private affairs, when things have turned out much better than we expected, and unlooked for help has been obtained when we &s;eemed to be on the brink of ruin. You remember the rebellion in the year forty-five, what a fright were we all in when the Pretender talked of marching to Finch|ley; but the goodne&s;s of God protected us. The duke of Cumberland defeated the rebel army, and it did not come farther than Derby. But we will talk of what has happened nearer the pre&s;ent time. The French you know have been threatening to invade us ever &s;ince the beginning of the war, and many people have been in a continual fright; but by two or three great victories at &s;ea, or by one means or other under the direction of Providence, here we are &s;till in &s;afety, though almo&s;t all the re&s;t of the world are involved in the &s;eat of war, and overwhelmed with confu&s;ion. Three or four years ago, you know there were continual meet|ings of wicked and &s;editious people to try to over|throw the King and Parliament, and to bring us into the &s;ame &s;tate as the French; but the&s;e bad de&s;igns were not permitted to &s;ucceed. Then again la&s;t year, when there was a mutiny in our &s;leet;
<PB N="5" REF="5">did it not then &s;eem as if all was over with us, for what could we hope, if our &s;eamen, our defence, turned again&s;t us; but you remember how it end|ed. The ringleaders were brought to puni&s;hment, and the re&s;t returned to their duty.</P>
<P>We &s;hould think of the&s;e pa&s;t deliverances Mrs. Nicholls to make us grateful to God, and to keep up our courage in the pre&s;ent danger; has not <HI>He</HI> who has pre&s;erved us through &s;o many perils, &s;till the &s;ame power to protect us? Let us then tru&s;t in him and cheerfully hope the be&s;t&punc; Let us not grumble at the taxes, as if they were intended only to enrich the King or Mr. Pitt, but let us remember that it is owing to them, we are &s;o happy to have an army and navy &s;o well equipped and ready at hand to defend us. Happily for you and I, my old friend, we have not the cares of governing the nation upon our &s;houlders. All we have to do is to fear God and do our duty in our private &s;tation, and then we can never tell how much we may each one of us be the means of drawing down the ble&s;|&s;ing of God upon our country. Recollect that Sodom would have been &s;aved if but ten righteous per&s;ons had been found in it.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all I have &s;aid, I cannot deny but that the times are very bad; and God thinking fit to puni&s;h the wickedne&s;s of &s;ome, and to try the faith of others, may permit us to fall into the hands of our enemies. Well, my good friend! and if it &s;hould be &s;o, have we not been long taught to con&s;ider this life only as a journey to a better? Do we not know that we are each day liable to all &s;orts of di&s;tre&s;s? What will it much &s;ig|nify whether our hou&s;es catch fire by accident, or are &s;et on fire by the French? Whether an Engli&s;h
<PB N="6" REF="6">or a French robber takes away our property? or whether we die upon our beds of a tormenting di&s;|ea&s;e, or are put to death at once by the enemy's &s;word. There is nothing &s;o terrible in a violent death as is often &s;uppo&s;ed. It is but &s;hortening the way to Heaven, and depriving us a few days or a few years of life, that would mo&s;t likely have brought with it many cares and infirmities. Though the French &s;tay away, we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> die once, and they can put us to death <HI>but</HI> once, let them do their wor&s;t again&s;t us. How excellent then is the ad|vice of our Saviour, "Fear not them which kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay to me, perhaps as you did &s;ome time ago, "I am not good enough to die. It is that thought that makes me afraid." I would not lead you to think too well of your&s;elf; but when I con&s;ider how much you have tried to obey your Creator, and how hone&s;tly and religiou&s;ly you have brought up your family, I am apt to &s;uppo&s;e that I know few people better prepared for death than your&s;elf. But the be&s;t among us have done &s;o many wrong things, that we &s;hould have cau&s;e to be alarmed if it was not for the gracious promi&s;es of God, and the interce&s;&s;ion of his beloved Son. But now the &s;ting of death is taken away. Je&s;us Chri&s;t has died for us, and if we believe in him and repent, we need not fear but we &s;hall obtain that high happine&s;s he came into the world to procure for us.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly you will reply, you do not fear the French &s;o much for your&s;elf as for your children. You cannot bear the thought that your &s;ons &s;hould die in battle, your daughters &s;uffer from the vio|lence
<PB N="7" REF="7">of wicked &s;oldiers, and your little grand|children wander about &s;ome one way and &s;ome another, and either be &s;tarved to death or fall into bad hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ad melancholy &s;uppo&s;itions indeed, and I hope none of them will ever come true. You &s;hould con&s;ider, that becau&s;e a country is invaded by an enemy, it does not follow that <HI>every</HI> per&s;on is a dreadful &s;ufferer. Thou&s;ands in different places, tho&s;e in a low &s;tation particularly, live on &s;till in the &s;ame way undi&s;turbed and unthought of. May you and yours be among this number, if the French &s;hould really come as they threaten to do.</P>
<P>But whatever becomes of your children, remem|ber they will be under the protection of Heaven. They are all good and virtuous, &s;o that your fir&s;t wi&s;hes are granted. Tru&s;t God for the re&s;t. Not one hair of their head can peri&s;h without his know|ledge. They are <HI>his</HI> children as well as <HI>yours,</HI> and he loves them better than you can po&s;&s;ibly do. He will make them as happy now as may be con&s;i&s;tent with their everla&s;ting happine&s;s; and will you not &s;ubmit to his will, if he &s;ees it nece&s;&s;ary to appoint that through much tribulation they &s;hall enter into his kingdom? If he brings them into difficulties, he will give them &s;trength to bear up under them. He will be the widow's con&s;olation and the orphan's hope.</P>
<P>Farewel my worthy old friend. Think of what I have written. Try to get up your &s;pirits, and do not let your whole family be unhappy from &s;ee|ing you wretched. What would you &s;ay to the old &s;oldier, who after fighting for years by the &s;ide of his general, turns coward and runs away
<PB N="8" REF="8">from him, in the la&s;t engagement? Then what will you &s;ay to the aged Chri&s;tian; who after having borne up cheerfully under many afflictions, &s;uffers him&s;elf at la&s;t to be ca&s;t down, and almo&s;t to give up his tru&s;t in the Lord. It is true, the times are hard, and to us who have families, the pro&s;pect before us is a little dark and dreary; but let us look above the&s;e earthly clouds, and we &s;hall &s;ee all bright again in Heaven.</P>
