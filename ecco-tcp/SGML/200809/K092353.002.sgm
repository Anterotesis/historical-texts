<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. Mr. PRESTON to Mi&s;s NANCY BLISSET.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 24, 1742-3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN this Letter I &s;hall give you &s;ome Remarks on only one Book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> namely, the Seventh.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 21 and 22, contain a very ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation on the Temper of a Mob,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
and that too perhaps, in all Countries and all Ages.</P>
<P>Is the Epithet <HI>rude,</HI> which is applied to the <HI>Phoeacians,</HI> Ver&s;e 55, entirely re|concileable to the Character given of them at Ver&s;e 12, in the la&s;t Book?</P>
<P>From Ver&s;e 110 to 175, is a mo&s;t charming De&s;cription of the Palace and Garden of <HI>Alcinous.</HI> Does it not appear to you that <HI>Ovid</HI> has borrowed the De|&s;cription of the <HI>Palace of the Sun,</HI> in the &s;econd Book of his <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> from this Place?</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 224. Here is a Pa&s;&s;age very ex|pre&s;&s;ive of that Ho&s;pitality you have re|marked and admired so much.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">From Ver&s;e 265 to 275, we have a great Re&s;emblance to the Holy Scrip|tures. One of the Apo&s;tles commands us <Q>to relieve Strangers, in-as-much as &s;uch have entertained Angels.</Q> We &s;ee it was &s;o with <HI>Lot, Abraham, Ja|cob,</HI> &amp;c. and further it is &s;aid, that <HI>God</HI> conver&s;ed with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Face to Face, as a Man does with his Friend.</P>
<P>At Ver&s;e 295, are the two Lines with which the Critics have found great Fault in the Tran&s;lation, as being too mean. The Expre&s;&s;ion, "craving Bowels," is rather beneath Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s u&s;ual Style.
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>370.</HI></BIBL> All Night I &s;lept <HI>oblivious</HI> of my Care.</Q>
Methinks <HI>forgetful</HI> of my Care, would, from its Simplicity, have &s;uited the Sub|ject better.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">I have done with this Book, &s;o &s;hall relea&s;e you from Critici&s;ms at pre&s;ent, and change to another Subject, in which I would recommend a little of that Ho&s;|pitality we &s;o admire in the Antients. I de&s;ire, nay in&s;i&s;t, that you will prepare a little <HI>genial Board</HI> for your Birth-Day, as I &s;hall do. Invite your Mama, your Aunt, and any other Friend you like; and I beg you will not &s;uffer any thing to be abridged, on this Occa&s;ion, to &s;ave a few Shillings. I know your Turn for Oeconomy, but remit the Strictne&s;s of it for once. Be&s;ides the Plea&s;ure it brings, it may an&s;wer &s;ome u&s;eful Ends. It will give you an Opportunity to &s;hew your own Addre&s;s, as Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Fea&s;t, di&s;play your Re&s;pect to your Pa|rents in an amiable Light, and, at the

&s;ame Time, gratify your affectionate Sen|&s;ations. I am a Friend to little Indul|gencies of this Kind, when confined within proper Re&s;trictions, and not too often repeated. Thus directed, they come within the Compa&s;s of Virtue, other|wi&s;e they extend to Profu&s;ion.</P>

<P>I Hope this will be delivered into your Hands to-morrow, being your Birth-Day, when you are with your Friends, or preparing to be with them.

<P>You have read of <HI>Pacolet</HI>'s wooden Hor&s;e, who, on turning a Pin, flew through the Air with his Rider, and went a great Journey in a few Moments. I could wi&s;h for &s;uch an Hor&s;e to-morrow Night, and after &s;pending four or five Hours with you, to mount and come back here; but as &s;uch a Wi&s;h is vain, I mu&s;t even be content to want that Plea&s;ure, and within two or three Weeks make u&s;e of a wooden Coach, in&s;tead of

a wooden Hor&s;e, and travel over Land, in&s;tead of flying through the Air.</P>
<P>I hope you will &s;pare &s;o much Time to-morrow Evening as to write me, if it is no more than two or three Lines; and in the next Letter after that, I mu&s;t have the Hi&s;tory of this Evening, your Birth-Day, and Sunday.

<P>JUST now I received yours of the 29th, and was about to be much &s;urprized that you was &s;o long in an&s;wering all the Letters I wrote you la&s;t Week. I was

I kept my Bed two Days, and have not been out &s;ince. Though &s;omewhat better now, I &s;till continue ill. Pray write me &s;oon again, and let me know how your Mama does. I &s;hall be &s;ure to acquaint you how I am. I dare not venture to write farther; it is with Pain I have written this.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM not yet quite recovered, and have been out but once, to wit, this Day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Probably Ea&s;ter Sunday.</NOTE>, to Chapel, it being a high Fe&s;tival, and the Sacrament admini&s;tered.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">I am mightily plea&s;ed with your Ob|&s;ervations on <HI>Rochefaucault.</HI> I &s;hall make &s;ome few Remarks here on the 8th and 9th <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> if I can get through them; but I am doubtful of my Abi|lity, as I yet cannot endure much Ap|plication.</P>
<P>From the Beginning of the 8th Book, we find the great Duties that were mo&s;t highly e&s;teemed in antient Times, were Prayer, Prai&s;es, Ho&s;pitality, and Sacri|fices, attended with Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Though the Re&s;entment of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> at Ver&s;e 183, is very ju&s;t, yet &s;urely he car|ries it too far.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> mentions the Opening of the 9th Book to have given great Joy to the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Critics, who wi&s;hed to find Fault with &s;o great an Author. I wonder what provoked them. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> only animad|verts on the happy State of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> which is extremely ju&s;t, and by no Means incon&s;i&s;tent with Virtue. To me there|fore all Apologies to &s;often the Matter are entirely u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 46. Quaere, what is meant by the Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>a like Reward?</HI></P>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>189.</HI></BIBL> We &s;ate indulging in the genial Rite.</Q>
<P>I am at a Lo&s;s to know why the Tran&s;lator makes u&s;e of this Expre&s;&s;ion here, the <HI>genial Rite.</HI></P>
<P>The Speech of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to <HI>Polypheme,</HI> be|ginning at Ver&s;e 307, is excellent. The la&s;t eight Lines are beautifully tran&s;lated,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and the Matter of them highly pious and in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 495. I think all this <HI>fort outr&eacute;e,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has &s;aid to make it pa&s;s; as well as the whole Story of <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Noman.</HI></P>
<P>By all Means let me know how your Mama and Aunt do. Write &s;oon, no Mat|ter on what Subject. I would hear any thing from you, though ever &s;o trifling. As drowning Men catch at Straws for Relief, &s;o di&s;pirited Folks catch at Tri|fles for Comfort; not that your Letters can ever be &s;uch to me.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I JUST now received yours of the 5th. I am &s;omewhat better, but not en|tirely recovered.</P>
<P>If you chu&s;e <HI>Milton</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> for the Subject of our en&s;uing Corre&s;pondence, I &s;hall be plea&s;ed; but if you like better to write &s;uch Thoughts as occur to you on any Author you happen to be reading at the Time of writing, I &s;hall be very well &s;atisfied. It is true there is a noble Fund in <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> but I would not keep you always confined to one

Kind of Study. The Book of <HI>Job,</HI> the <HI>P&s;alms, Proverbs, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes,</HI> the <HI>Wi&s;|dom of Solomon,</HI> and of <HI>the Son of Sirach,</HI> &s;upply large and rich Funds for Ob&s;erva|tions; but take your own way, and plea&s;e your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have written you till I had read four or five more Books of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> unle&s;s you had been impa|tient; and as the Po&s;t is ju&s;t going out, I &s;hall not add more here, nor even tran&s;cribe my Remarks on two Books of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> that are ready; &s;o you will probably get five together.</P>
<P>I may &s;ee you about this Day fort|night, or perhaps &s;ooner. In the mean Time, keep your&s;elf employed. Write

about &s;omething, no Matter what. The Mind requires Exertion, and it is as liable to be di&s;ordered through Inactivity, as the Body.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 10, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is worth Ob&s;ervation, that <HI>Homer</HI> every now and then &s;catters &s;hort moral Reflections as he goes along: for Example, Book x. Ver&s;e 29.
<Q>Rare Gift! &mdash;but oh! what Gift to Fools avails?</Q>
<PB N="19" REF="20">
No Wonder indeed he is &s;o pregnant with them, &s;ince Virtue is the great End of his Work.</P>
<P>The Interview between <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and his Mother, in Hell, Book xi. Ver&s;e 190, is exceeding fine.</P>
<P>At Ver&s;e 423, we have a new In&s;tance of the Ho&s;pitality of the Antients.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 444. In &s;pite of all that is &s;aid in Defence of <HI>Homer</HI> here, I cannot help thinking all this Speech very mean, and unworthy of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;cription of <HI>Hercules,</HI> at Ver&s;e 747, is very awful.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">I am of Opinion, that if you take the whole Account of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>'s De&s;cent into Hell, and compare it with that of <HI>Aeneas</HI> in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s &s;ixth Aeneid, you will find the former fall infinitely &s;hort of the latter; than which nothing, &s;ure, was ever writ|ten with greater Ma&s;tery of Fancy and Judgment. It is worth your while to compare them.</P>
<P>Now we are to leave the <HI>Phoeacians,</HI> and I cannot, for my Heart, think they were &s;o worthle&s;s a People, as the Com|mentators would make them. Are they not kind, ho&s;pitable, and beneficent? Do they not under&s;tand the Arts of Sail|ing, Building, Gardening, Commerce, and &s;o forth? All that can be &s;aid again&s;t them, is, that they lived luxuriou&s;ly;
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and is there any Wonder that &s;uch a happy People &s;hould live &s;o?</P>
<P>The Commentators excu&s;e <HI>Homer</HI> for the &s;trange improbable Stories he makes <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> tell, becau&s;e he tells them to an idle, credulous, vain-glorious People. But, in my Opinion, this is no Defence, at all; for as they do not contradict his Narrations, &s;o it is immaterial, as to the Truth of the Stories, who he told them to.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil,</HI> in my Opinion, has not only happily imitated the Story of <HI>Elpenor,</HI> in the twelfth Book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> but has al&s;o improved upon it. Herein the Latin &s;eems to have an Advantage over the Greek Poet. <HI>Homer's Elpenor</HI> was a
<PB N="22" REF="23">
worthle&s;s Fellow, yet the Author treats him as a Man of great Importance. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> fir&s;t meets him in Hell, where there is a long Conver&s;ation between them, and, un|de&s;erving as he was, great Care is taken about his Monument; whereas <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Palinurus,</HI> be&s;ides being his chief Pilot, was a Man of Integrity and Virtue.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 210. What Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign|ed why <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> did not &s;top his Ears with Wax as well as the re&s;t? The Song of the Syrens here is admirable, and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has rendered it in Lines exqui&s;itely &s;mooth and melodious.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>268.</HI></BIBL>
<L>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;forgetful of the Voice divine,</L>
<L>All dreadful bright, my Limbs in Armour &s;hine.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">Was not this Madne&s;s in <HI>Uly&s;&s;es?</HI> Yet it were Pity, had it not been; &s;ince it contains a noble Moral, in &s;hewing us the Folly and Ab&s;urdity of di&s;obeying the Commands of Heaven.</P>
<P>The People whom <HI>Homer</HI> devotes to De&s;truction, Ver&s;e 420, you are to ob|&s;erve, he fir&s;t prepares for it, by a pro|fane and illicit Way of performing Sa|crifice. They are going to perpetrate an impious Deed, and they addre&s;s them&s;elves to it in a profane Manner. Compare this with the Sacrifices of <HI>Korah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> and with the Of|ferings of <HI>Nabal</HI> and <HI>Abihu,</HI> who put unhallowed Fire into their Cen&s;ers. See the Book of <HI>Numbers,</HI> Chap. xvi. &amp;c. The Vengeance which overtook the Com|panions
<PB N="24" REF="25">
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> for de&s;troying, or taking to their own U&s;e, what was con&s;ecrated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> &s;eems to be a general Warn|ing to Mankind, not to convert to pro|fane U&s;es what has been once &s;et apart for religious Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Book xiii. Ver&s;e 35. Here is a fine Repre&s;entation of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and it is much heightened by the Simile. Had you ever been in the Country at the Time of great Labour, you would be much more &s;en|&s;ible of the Strength of it; but the Ju&s;t|ne&s;s &s;peaks for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 270. I cannot but think that the Doubts of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> after he knew the Per&s;on who &s;poke to him was <HI>Pallas,</HI> are unju&s;tifiable and unrea&s;onable.
<Q><PB N="25" REF="26">
<BIBL>Ver. <HI>445.</HI></BIBL>
<L>Tho' leagu'd again&s;t me hundred He|roes &s;tand,</L>
<L>Hundreds &s;hall fall, if <HI>Pallas</HI> aid my Hand.</L></Q>
How very like is this Sentiment to what is frequently &s;aid in the Holy Scriptures! For In&s;tance, <Q>I will not be afraid for ten Thou&s;ands of People, that have &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t me round about.</Q> <HI>P&s;al.</HI> iii. Ver. 6.</P>
<P>At Ver&s;e 486, we have one of <HI>Homer</HI>'s &s;hort moral Reflections,
<Q><L>Set thy Soul at Re&s;t,</L>
<L>And know, whatever Heav'n ordains, is be&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>We now come to the fourteenth Book, one of the mo&s;t beautiful in the whole Work. This was my Favourite when I was a Boy, and has remained &s;o ever
<PB N="26" REF="27">
&s;ince. Nothing can be more &s;imple, na|tural, and affecting, than this Interview between <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Eumoeus.</HI> The whole indeed is &s;uch a &s;weet Scene of the Coun|try, and contains &s;uch a Series of Piety and Goodne&s;s, as fills the Mind with inexpre&s;&s;ible Delight. What an exqui|&s;ite Picture does the Poet give of <HI>Eumoeus</HI> at the Opening!</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 146. How true, even to this Day, is the Ob&s;ervation which <HI>Eumoeus</HI> makes in this Place!</P>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>480.</HI></BIBL>
<L>The&s;e, while on &s;ev'ral Tables they di&s;po&s;e,</L>
<L>As Prie&s;t him&s;elf, the blamele&s;s Ru&s;tic ro&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>It appears that <HI>Homer,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing he has a great Re&s;pect for the Prie&s;t|hood,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
thought every Head, or Chief of a Family, was a &s;ort of Prie&s;t in his own Hou&s;e, at lea&s;t in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, and this many People contend for, at this Day. Even &s;ome very learned and pious Men maintain, that, if a Society of Men were ca&s;t on &s;ome Place, where they could not have the Ordinances duly admini&s;tered by a legally-admitted Cler|gyman, it were then lawful for a Lay|man to perform the &s;acred Functions. Something of this Nature is the Permi&s;|&s;ion which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> gives to Midwives to baptize, in Ca&s;es of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity.
<Q><BIBL>Ver&s;e <HI>494.</HI></BIBL>
<P>From God's own Hand de&s;cend our Joys and Woes.</P></Q>
Here is a Piece of Theology exactly
<PB N="28" REF="29">

<P>Ver&s;e 426. What <HI>Homer</HI> here ob&s;erves of dedicating a Part of a Winter-Night to Conver&s;ation, and particularly to the Re|collection of pa&s;t Afflictions, is very na|tural and ju&s;t.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday I received a Letter from you, of no Date, which I impute to the Hurry you were in when you wrote it. If the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> had not been here, I had &s;een you before now. He went away on Saturday; I accom|panied him to <HI>Henley,</HI> about 18 Miles from this City, &s;tayed there all Night, and returned hither on Sunday. My Vi&s;it to <HI>Tew,</HI> the Place where his Grace's Aunt re&s;ides, was to have been made
<PB N="37" REF="38">
this Day, but is deferred till my Return from <HI>London</HI>; &s;o I &s;hall &s;ee you &s;ooner than I thought, and perhaps may be able to tell you the exact Time, before I &s;eal this Letter.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> has no Occa|&s;ion for the Degree of Doctor of Laws, but it is an Honour the Univer&s;ity pays him. It is cu&s;tomary to confer dif|ferent Degrees of Honour, to tho&s;e who &s;tudy therein. That of <HI>Batchelor of Arts,</HI> may be taken after having re&s;ided &s;o long a Time, and undergoing &s;uch Examina|tions as are appointed. In the &s;ame Manner, Students may be advanced to the Degree of <HI>Ma&s;ter of Arts.</HI> After|wards they can be promoted to a <HI>Batche|lor&s;hip</HI> in one of the three great Profe&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="38" REF="39">
Divinity, Law, or Phy&s;ic; and after that they may be made <HI>Doctors</HI> in tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, according to the dif|ferent Studies they have pur&s;ued. But &s;ometimes the&s;e Degrees are conferred, without waiting the ordinary Time, or pa&s;&s;ing the Examinations, <HI>Honoris Grati&acirc;,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to do Honour to the Per|&s;on who receives them. This was the Ca&s;e with the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> he hav|ing been greatly beloved, e&s;teemed, and re&s;pected, for his Behaviour, while at this Univer&s;ity. I hope I have now &s;a|tisfied your Curio&s;ity; but I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you that &s;ometimes a Doc|tor&s;hip in a fourth Profe&s;&s;ion is given, namely, in Mu&s;ic; but this is not held, in any wi&s;e, equal to the others.</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Angel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Arrived &s;afe here ye&s;ternight, between &s;even and eight, nothing having hap|pened worth mentioning, except that I
<PB N="40" REF="41">
was mortified with a great deal of imper|tinent Chat in the Coach. We were forced to drive two Miles out of the Way to &s;et down two Boys at their Mo|ther's Door. One Pa&s;&s;enger grumbled much at it. I a&s;ked him, whether he would not, in the Parent's Situation, wi&s;h for &s;uch a Courte&s;y, at the trifling Inconvenience of a &s;hort Delay to the Pa&s;&s;engers, and in fine Weather? He received the Reproof in Silence, though he did not &s;eem by his Looks to thank me for it. There are more &s;uch unfo|ciable Per&s;ons to be met, who prefer the Indulgence of their own peculiar Hu|mour, to any e&s;&s;ential Gratification or Ser|vice they can be&s;tow on others. Poor Peo|ple! they are compo&s;ed of very indifferent Principles, or have been very ill taught.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">I have found all my Friends here well. No Revolutions or News in our littte Society &s;ince I left it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now fini&s;h the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI>; but as I have &s;everal Things to do and &s;ettle, and Letters to write, you may perhaps not hear from me again for two or three Days. As &s;oon as I have fini&s;hed the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> we &s;hall think of &s;omething el&s;e to furni&s;h out our epi&s;tolary Conver&s;ation. You know no Po&s;t goes from this Place on Saturday, nor arrives here on Mon|day, &s;o you cannot expect a Letter from from me again till Tue&s;day at &s;oone&s;t, and it may be later; yet let not that pre|vent your writing.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43">At the Beginning of my Letter, I men|tioned impertinent Chat. I will give you one In&s;tance. There was one Fel|low in the Coach, who told us, three Times, a long, dull, and con&s;equently tedious Story, of his having been at the taking of a Highwayman; but that, like a prudent Soldier, he re&s;erved his Fire till he had Occa&s;ion for it. When he had told it us once, he took care to re|peat it as often as any new Pa&s;&s;enger came into the Coach, which produced, on the whole, a third Narration. He de&s;cribed the Highwayman's Per&s;on and Dre&s;s, his Hor&s;e, his own Hor&s;e, the whole Chace, his per&s;onal Intrepidity, the taking, Trial, and Condemnation of the unhappy Rogue, with a Thou&s;and more contingent Circum&s;tances equally
<PB N="43" REF="44">
important and entertaining. How na|tural is it to repeat, as well as to aggran|dize Matters, which we think may re|dound to our own Credit! The Story &s;till buzzes in my Ears, and haunts me like a Gho&s;t; but if I dwell upon it any longer, I &s;hall become as trouble&s;ome as the Relater, &s;o I break off.</P>

<P>ONCE more for the Ody&s;&s;ey. I have got through three Books more, on which I have made but few Ob&s;er|vations.</P>
<P>Book xx. Ver&s;e 55. The Complaint of <HI>Minerva,</HI> in this Place, is analogous to that which we find &s;o often made by our Saviour in the Go&s;pel, <HI>O ye of little Faith,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 120. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> de&s;iring a Sign to confirm his Faith, in this and the two
<PB N="47" REF="48">
following Books, is exactly conformable to many Places in Scripture. The Story of <HI>Ahaz,</HI> as well as of others, will &s;uf|ficiently prove it.</P>
<P>Book xxi. Ver&s;e 10. Is it not too much affected to call <HI>Ivory, Elephant?</HI> It is done, however, in other Places as well as in this.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 274. The Suitors impute their Impotence in bending the Bow of <HI>Uly&s;|&s;es,</HI> to their Profanation of a holy Day. Whether it was a fictitious or a real Ex|cu&s;e, it &s;hews at lea&s;t that Irreligion was held a very atrocious Crime in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 427. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> turning and examin|ing the Bow, to prove if it was decayed
<PB N="48" REF="49">
or worm-eaten, amid the Taunts of the Suitors, and his bending it, compared to a Mu&s;ician winding up the Strings of his In&s;trument, is mo&s;t admirably fine. The Notes here are well worth reading.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 448. This is an exqui&s;ite Com|pari&s;on. The Twang of the String, &s;hort and &s;harp, like the &s;hrill Note of a Swal|low, was equally a Mark of Vigour and Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Book xxii. Ver&s;e 367. All that follows here, relative to <HI>Phemius</HI> and <HI>Medon,</HI> their Supplication, the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>Tele|machus,</HI> and the Motives which induced Uly&s;&s;es to &s;pare them, excite both our Pity and Admiration. The Idea which <HI>Phemius</HI> gives of Poets and Poetry, is
<PB N="49" REF="50">
one of the fine&s;t that can be conceived, and worthy to be imprinted on every Memory.</P>
<Q><L>For dear to Gods and Men is &s;acred Song.</L>

<P>I Shall in this clo&s;e what I have to &s;ay on the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>Book xxiii. Ver&s;e 13. Here are four Lines which are very con&s;onant to what
<PB N="51" REF="52">
we frequently meet in the holy Writings, particularly in the 19th Chapter <HI>I&s;aiah;</HI> "Surely the Princes of <HI>Zoan</HI> are Fools, &amp;c."</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 81, and &s;ome following Lines, contain Sentiments very analogous to many in the Book of <HI>Job.</HI> It is worth your while to compare them with the following Chapters, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, which indeed are worth the mo&s;t atten|tive Peru&s;al and Remarks.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 320. This Conver&s;ation between <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Penelope,</HI> how naturally beau|tiful! In all Degrees of Life we may hourly trace the &s;ame Con&s;equences of a long Ab&s;ence, whether between Man and Wife, or Friend and Friend. The
<PB N="52" REF="53">
Epi&s;ode of <HI>Mercury</HI> conducting the Souls of the Suitors to Hell, at the Opening of the 24th Book, is undoubtedly fine; though after all that can be &s;aid in De|fence of it, to me it appears brought in (to u&s;e a common Phra&s;e) by Head and Shoulders. It &s;eems as if the Poet had the Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;o much at Heart, that he thought it not &s;ufficient|ly compleated, without this fini&s;hing Stroke.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 224. <HI>Homer,</HI> you ob&s;erve, takes every Opportunity to pay Honour to Poets and Poetry. The&s;e two Lines,
<Q><L>The Gods, to honour her fair Fame, &s;hall rai&s;e</L>
<L>(Their great Reward) a Poet in her Prai&s;e,</L></Q>
and the &s;ix preceding, are &s;o &s;trong, and at the &s;ame Time &s;o charming an Incen|tive
<PB N="53" REF="54">
to Virtue, that I cannot but think a Woman, who has a laudable Ambi|tion and Love of Virtue, mu&s;t be greatly confirmed by them, in a virtuous and honourable Cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 249. I cannot endure <HI>Pope</HI>'s bald Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>the old Man,</HI> for &s;o he makes Ulys&s;&s;es &s;tile his Father. In <HI>Homer</HI> it is <HI>the Father,</HI> which has undeniably much more Decorum, Re&s;pect, and Af|fection.</P>
<P>I have nothing further to add to what has been &s;aid in the Notes on the Clo&s;e of this great Work.

<P>JUST now I have the Plea&s;ure of of yours. You thank me for what does not de&s;erve Thanks. The Picture was drawn to my Hand, and I thought
<PB N="58" REF="59">
it a Picture worth your looking at; though I a&s;&s;ure you, I had not the lea&s;t Idea that it re&s;embled you. Had I thought &s;o, I &s;hould not have been at &s;o much Pains as to tran&s;cribe it, merely to mor|tify you. Yet your Application may turn to &s;ome Account: it may &s;erve as a Hint or Notice to &s;hew you what you are to &s;hun, or as a Beacon &s;et up to warn you of the Rocks and Shelves, whereon many of your Sex have been &s;hipwrecked.</P>
<P>I now &s;end you two Songs, leaving you to find out where their Value lies; and when you have wrote me your Thoughts of them, I will then let you know wherein I think their Merit con&s;i&s;ts. I do not know if ever you read the <HI>Pro|gre&s;s

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JUST now I received yours. Your Ob&s;ervations are very ju&s;t. The whole Song con&s;i&s;ts of a Heap of fine
<PB N="60" REF="61">
&s;mooth Words, put together either with|out any Meaning at all, or ending in downright Non&s;en&s;e, after the Manner of many of our modern Love-Songs. I would have you ob&s;erve too that there are no le&s;s than two Similes in &s;o &s;hort a Poem, which is very ordi|nary in our Love-Songs, though very unnatural; and, be&s;ides that they have no Relation to the Subject, they are very ab&s;urd in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The other Ballad is a very &s;evere Sa|tire on the Gentlemen of the Army. The Beauty of it con&s;i&s;ts in its appear|ing &s;o very &s;erious, and being &s;o exceed|ingly ridiculous. I beg you will par|ticularly ob&s;erve the two la&s;t Stanzas, &s;ave one. Here the per&s;onated Officer
<PB N="61" REF="62">
accu&s;es him&s;elf both with Cowardice and Ignorance of Letters. Mark how ri|diculous a Fall he makes in Stanza the third.
<Q>Alas! I never thought a Prie&s;t would plea&s;e your Palate;</Q>
This &s;eems to be grave and &s;erious; ob|&s;erve what follows;
<Q>Be&s;ides, I'll hold a Groat, he'll put you in a Ballad.</Q>
How &s;erious does he appear, when he &s;ays,
<Q>It fills my Heart with Woe, &amp;c.</Q>
and afterwards calls a Churchman being by the Ladies preferred to an Officer, "the Growth of Corruption, <HI>&amp;c."</HI> It
<PB N="62" REF="63">
is, all through, a mo&s;t admirable Satire, and the Humour is exceedingly well hit off. Then it is calculated for the Tune of <HI>Patie</HI>'s <HI>Mill.</HI> If you heard it &s;ung to that Tune, you would find it &s;et off mightily; it being a &s;weet com|plaining Scotch Tune, the Captain's Complaint, if we may &s;o call it, would thereby become &s;till more ridiculous.</P>
<P><HI>Charles Murray</HI> does not &s;ucceed to the Title, but a Son of <HI>David Murray,</HI> who was an elder Brother than <HI>Charles.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 7, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Suppo&s;e you have, before this comes to your Hand, formed a Judgment of the three Ladies I &s;ent to wait upon you; I mean <HI>Sylvia, Artime&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Phryne.</HI> You may learn &s;omething from the Con|ver&s;ation of the two fir&s;t; but as for Ma|dam <HI>Phryne,</HI> I cannot &s;ay you can im|prove by her; and indeed, but that &s;he has a little Wit in her Conver&s;ation, I
<PB N="65" REF="66">
had not &s;ent her to you at all. <HI>Sylvia</HI> is a poor Lady, who &s;truggles between Virtue and Vice, and is really not &s;o bad as &s;he would appear. She has taken up a fal&s;e Notion of the Means of recom|mending her&s;elf to the E&s;teem of Man|kind. She thinks ill-natured Wit, Cen|&s;ure, and Raking, are the Ingredients for the Compo&s;ition of a fine Lady, yet her Heart recoils every now and then. How many poor Women have lo&s;t them|&s;elves through this fooli&s;h Notion! There is nothing more dangerous for any Per|&s;on, e&s;pecially a Woman, than to &s;et up &s;ome wrong Quality as the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Mark of her Character. A Coward perhaps &s;ets up for a Bully, a chearful Woman for a Prude, or a mode&s;t, good-natured Girl takes it into her Head to
<PB N="66" REF="67">
be a Termagant. Now be&s;ides being unnatural from quitting their proper Characters, they are all alike full of Af|fectation, than which nothing is more dete&s;table, except downright Inconti|nence. <HI>Artime&s;ia</HI> is a Prude, but a ma&s;|culine Prude; &s;he affects Learning, but neglects Decency, Cleanline&s;s, and Mo|de&s;ty. If I were with you, I think I could name three Per&s;ons, with whom the Characters agree very well, though I could not tell you the exact Per&s;ons the Poet meant.</P>
<P>I have herewith &s;ent you a fourth Character, which is not &s;o bad as the former; for I think it very natural, as well as excu&s;able, for People, e&s;pecially Women, to talk of their Children, Family
<PB N="67" REF="68">
Affairs, and &s;o forth; and &s;till more &s;o in Country Places, where they meet their Neighbours only now and then. Hence I think the Doctor rather too &s;evere, un|le&s;s he barely meant that Women &s;hould not carry this &s;ort of Di&s;cour&s;e to Ex|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>I have now &s;ent you five or &s;ix bad Characters of your Sex, to which you may add whatever you may have read be&s;ide. <HI>Congreve</HI> furni&s;hes many; name|ly, Mrs. <HI>Fondlewife</HI><NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Laetitia</HI> in the <HI>Old Batchelor.</HI></NOTE>, Mrs. <HI>Frail</HI><NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Love for Love.</NOTE>, Mrs. <HI>Fore&s;ight</HI><NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Love for Love.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Froth</HI><NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Double Dealer.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Pliant</HI><NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">Double Dealer.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Touchwood</HI><NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">Double Dealer.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Wi&s;hfort</HI><NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">Way of the World.</NOTE>, Mrs. <HI>Marwood</HI><NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">Way of the World.</NOTE>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="69">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and even his virtuous Characters are worth ob&s;erving for their Failings; for Example, the Affectation of <HI>Belin|da</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Old Batchelor.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Millamant</HI><NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Way of the World.</HI></NOTE>, and the Wild|ne&s;s of <HI>Angelica</HI><NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Love for Love.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some Critics have a&s;&s;erted that <HI>Con|greve</HI> has drawn none but vicious Cha|racters, but I think they are mi&s;taken. <HI>Cynthia</HI> <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Double Dealer.</HI></NOTE> is an Exception. He has many other beautiful Characters, not faultle&s;s indeed. That Writer was too great a Ma&s;ter of Nature, to draw
<Q>Faultle&s;s Mon&s;ters that the World ne'er &s;aw,</Q>
as the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> calls them. We mu&s;t not forget <HI>Ben John&s;on's</HI> Lady
<PB N="69" REF="70">
<HI>Wou'd-be</HI><NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Volpone.</HI></NOTE>, and <HI>Otway</HI>'s <HI>Lady Dunce</HI><NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Soldier for the Ladies.</HI></NOTE>. The&s;e bad Characters (which weak un|di&s;cerning People have condemned as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mproper for Repre&s;entation, and thence have endeavoured to decry the Utility of the Drama in general) have all their good Tendencies. There is &s;omething to be culled out of every one worth ob|&s;erving and &s;hunning; and tho&s;e who &s;ay that faulty Characters &s;hould not be produced on the Stage, might with an equal Degree of Propriety a&s;&s;ert, that there &s;hould be no Shade in a Picture.</P>
<P>In my next I will &s;end you &s;ome plea&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng Characters from the &s;ame Author; but in the mean Time (by the way of Mu&s;ic between the Acts) I give you &s;ome
<PB N="70" REF="71">
Extracts from Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Poem on his own Death. You will find in it a great deal of Wit, Humour, good Sen&s;e, and true Judgment of Mankind, and the Faults of both Sexes mo&s;t humourou&s;ly expo&s;ed and ridiculed.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may have read this Poem already, notwith&s;tanding, attend to it once more. Much Good may be derived from it Vice and Folly appear in &s;o many Shapes, that it is worth our while to &s;tudy as many and as various Cha|racters of faulty Men and Women, as we can find, in order to warn us again&s;t them, in what&s;oever Shape they may appear, or attack us. I &s;hall refer a Tran&s;lation of a Pa&s;&s;age of this Tenden|cy from the noble Hi&s;torian, <HI>Livy,</HI> to

<P>If Affairs will permit, I could wi&s;h you to come and &s;tay a while here this Summer; but then you ought to bring a Recommendation with you to &s;ome Fa|mily here, (for indeed I am not acquaint|ed with any) otherwi&s;e, I fear your Time may go off very heavily.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here enclo&s;e you two Poems; in one of them the e&s;timable and unbecom|ing Qualifications of your Sex are &s;et in Oppo&s;ition to each other, by Way of Contra&s;t. How la&s;ting are tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Sort, how fleeting tho&s;e of the lat|ter! Beauty and all external Advantages are ingeniou&s;ly compared to Fruit in|grafted on the Stock of an annual Plant, which indeed makes a luxuriant Shoot, but is &s;oon gone. I pre&s;ume you know that an annual Plant continues only one Year, &s;uch as Fruits, Vegetables, and
<PB N="76" REF="77">
Corn of all Kinds. Tho&s;e which la&s;t many Years, as large Trees, we call Perennials.</P>
<P>In the other Poem the <HI>Dean</HI> pur&s;ues <HI>Epictetus</HI>'s Notion of Things in our own Power, &s;uch as Virtue and Truth. He makes &s;mall Account of Beauty, Shape, Complexion, and &s;uch Qualities as we cannot procure to our&s;elves; but Honour, Cha&s;tity, Decency, Integrity, and all within our own Power to attain, he places in a mo&s;t e&s;timable Light.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid,</HI> in his <HI>Art of Love,</HI> which I be|lieve you have by you, or at lea&s;t have read, finely pur&s;ues the &s;ame Train of Ideas, both in his two fir&s;t Books, which he wrote to in&s;truct the Men, and in his
<PB N="77" REF="78">
third, which he calculated to regulate the Conduct of Women.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething exceeding &s;ingular in the Humour of both Poems. In <HI>Stella</HI>'s <HI>Birth-Day</HI> he continues the Strain he be|gan with, in talking of her. He then puts the&s;e in Oppo&s;ition, and, as it were, Foils to her, as if they were really <HI>Signs.</HI> Witne&s;s tho&s;e four mo&s;t humorous Lines,
<Q><L>Then who can think we'll quit the Place,</L>
<L>When Doll hangs out a newer Face,</L>
<L>Or &s;top and 'light at Chloe's Head,</L>
<L>With Scraps and Leavings to be fed?</L></Q></P>
<P>I have many more entertaining Pieces for you of the <HI>Dean</HI>'s, &s;uch as <HI>Mary the Cookmaid</HI>'s <HI>Letter to Dr. Sheridan,</HI> and two Bal|lads;
<PB N="78" REF="79">
the one &s;tiled <HI>Quadrille,</HI> the other <HI>Molly Mog,</HI> which I will &s;end you at &s;ome future Time, if you tell me in your next Letter that you have not &s;een them. I do not think it a Trouble to tran&s;cribe a Piece of any Length, provided I am a&s;&s;ured you reap either In&s;truction or Delight from it; but both the&s;e united ought to be the Re&s;ult of Reading. If <HI>you</HI> do not acquire this Advantage, the Fault, I &s;hould conceive, mu&s;t be in my wrong Choice of Materials. You are docile and quick; and with a Per&s;on of your Talents, Hints and tran&s;ient Ob&s;er|vations, delivered in this light ea&s;y Mode of a Letter, will go further than all the &s;et formal Rules for teaching, that ever were laid down.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">Till I &s;end you the above, you &s;hall have <HI>Prometheus,</HI> written again&s;t <HI>Wood</HI> and his Halfpence. It is very full of Wit. I give it you therefore now by way of Relief, and at &s;ome future Time you &s;hall have his favourable Characters of Women.</P>
<P>I think it nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome Account of the above-mentioned Poem, which po&s;&s;ibly you are a Stranger to.</P>
<P>A Man, who&s;e Name was <HI>Wood,</HI> ob|tained a Patent from King George I. to make Halfpenny Pieces of ba&s;e Metal, which were to be current in <HI>Ireland.</HI> This Project would have drained that poor Kingdom of all the good Money; but the <HI>Dean,</HI> under the Name of <HI>M. B.
<PB N="80" REF="81">
Drapier,</HI> wrote &s;uch &s;mart Letters and Poems, &s;ometimes &s;erious and &s;ometimes ludicrous, as to rai&s;e a Re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>Wood,</HI> that aboli&s;hed his Scheme. The Nation would not receive any of his Coin, and the Coiner was in Danger of being torn in Pieces. From that Time, the <HI>Dean</HI> was looked on as the Deliverer of his Country.</P>
<P>You talk of going to <HI>Richmond</HI> for a few Days. You mu&s;t &s;tay a Week abroad at lea&s;t, otherwi&s;e it is not worth your while to go. During your Excur&s;ion, you &s;hould go by Water to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> &s;ee that Palace, the famous <HI>Cartoons</HI> of <HI>Ra|phael,</HI> and the Beauties of King <HI>William</HI>'s Court.

Ca&s;cades, from thence to <HI>Ham-Hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;o return to <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>I give you this Advice, becau&s;e I wi&s;h that every thing you undertake, even a Scheme of Di&s;&s;ipation, &s;hould an&s;wer &s;ome u&s;eful End. A Survey of fine Paint|ing feeds the Mind, by enlarging the Fancy; the Walks and Ca&s;cades &s;hew what human Art is capable of; and even a Meadow or common Field are Sources of Learning, Piety, and Admira|tion, in an attentive and well-directed Mind.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVE you an Inclination for <HI>Molly Mog,</HI> or the <HI>Letter to Mr. John Moore</HI> about Worms? They are both di|verting.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90">You have now read the <HI>Journal of a modern fine Lady.</HI> It &s;ets forth the fooli&s;h unprofitable Manner in which many La|dies pa&s;s, or rather wa&s;te their Time, in &s;o lively a Strain, that I think you &s;hould read it often, and that with great Atten|tion. Not that I mean to imply any immediate Nece&s;&s;ity you have for it; but though you do not &s;tand in need of it by way of Remedy, it might &s;erve to carry about as an Amulet or Charm; a kind of Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the Evils it is calculated to cure.</P>
<P><HI>Livy,</HI> the great <HI>Roman Hi&s;torian,</HI> &s;ays, the U&s;e of Hi&s;tory is to teach us what we are to &s;hun, and what we are to imi|taee. This ought to be the great End of Poetry as well as Hi&s;tory. And <HI>Horace,</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="91">
who was one of the mo&s;t judicious Poets that ever lived in any Age or Country, tells us, this In&s;truction is to be attained from a Mixture of the <HI>utile</HI> with the <HI>dulce,</HI> that is, of the <HI>u&s;eful</HI> with the <HI>plea&s;ant.</HI> Now in all the little Poems I have &s;ent you, I think there is this Mixture; and they likewi&s;e an&s;wer the End pre&s;cribed by <HI>Livy,</HI> they <Q>teach what we are to &s;hun, and what to imitate.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI>'s golden Rule of <HI>utile dulci,</HI> was never more properly applied than when it was made the Motto of a Thea|tre; &s;ince the Stage, under &s;uitable Re|gulations, is mo&s;t capable of an&s;wering the Intent. The greate&s;t moral Writers can only pre&s;cribe Rules for a Rectitude of Conduct and Decorum of Behaviour;
<PB N="91" REF="92">
the Stage &s;hews you the Beauty and Force of tho&s;e Rules, when put into Practice. It moreover an&s;wers the great Purpo&s;e and U&s;e which <HI>Livy</HI> a&s;cribes to Hi&s;tory. It &s;hews <Q>what to &s;hun, and what to imitate,</Q> more immediately and ac|curately than any Hi&s;torian what&s;oever is capable of doing.</P>
<P>I enclo&s;e the <HI>Quidnuncs.</HI> I think there is not any thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubjoin, by way of Note, except to tell you that the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was Regent of <HI>France</HI> in this King's Minority. He was a very great Man, and died when I was in <HI>France,</HI> in the Year 1722.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know exactly when you &s;et out for <HI>Richmond,</HI> becau&s;e I
<PB N="92" REF="93">
think I can provide you a very agreeable Companion in the literary Way. It is a Poem called <HI>The Alley.</HI> It de&s;cribes all inconvenient and di&s;agreeable Circum|&s;tances, which are met in the plea&s;ant-&s;ituated Town and Villages on the Banks of the <HI>Thames.</HI> It would be an Enter|tainment to you any where, and at any Time; but you will be much more &s;en|&s;ible of the Beauties, when you are pa&s;&s;ing through tho&s;e Places. I therefore &s;hall not &s;end it, till you tell me that you are about to &s;et forward.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you herewith a &s;mall Collection of <HI>Epigrammatical</HI> Poems; the Beauty of this Kind of writing con&s;i&s;ts in a cer|tain Point, or Turn of Wit. They are rather for your Diver&s;ion, than any thing el&s;e. This perhaps you may reproach me for, as deviating from the great <HI>utile dulci,</HI> which I &s;o &s;trongly recom|mended in my la&s;t Letter. But, pro|vided this Rule is generally practi&s;ed, there is no Harm in a &s;hort ca&s;ual Devia|tion; as there is not any thing ami&s;s in ri&s;ing to a Game of Battledore and Shut|tlecock,
<PB N="94" REF="95">
after a long &s;edentary Applica|tion to Reading or Writing; nay it is ra|ther right than wrong, in-as-much as it tends to render both Mind and Body, like <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s relaxed Bow, <Q>fitter for U&s;e when you want them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>The Happine&s;s of a Par&s;on's Life,</HI> is &s;urely exceeding humorous. It very na|turally de&s;cribes tho&s;e &s;imple and hum|ble Plea&s;ures, whereof a Country Cler|gyman's Life con&s;i&s;ts. Yet the&s;e per|haps afford a more la&s;ting Satisfaction, (though not &s;o exqui&s;ite an Enjoyment) than tho&s;e which are more refined, and what the <HI>French</HI> call more <HI>&s;pirituelles</HI>; at lea&s;t, they are very innocent Plea|&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">One of the next two Poems I &s;hall &s;end you, is called <HI>the Elephant,</HI> or <HI>Par|liament-Man,</HI> and the other <HI>Aye and No.</HI> They both &s;atirize, with great Wit and Humour, the Corruption of <HI>Members,</HI> which &s;o &s;hamefully prevails at pre&s;ent. The Parliament, I pre&s;ume you know, is an A&s;&s;emblage of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons of a Kingdom, for national Purpo&s;es. It de|rives its Name from the French Verb <HI>parler, to &s;peak.</HI> We have our Engli&s;h Word <HI>Parley,</HI> from the &s;ame Root. Per|haps you could have told me this, and perhaps not, and your Ignorance never|thele&s;s not to be taxed with Blame. It is amazing how much Knowledge is lo&s;t for Want of a little common Attention or Ob&s;ervation in our general Intercour&s;e
<PB N="96" REF="97">
with the World. Numberle&s;s are the In&s;tances I have &s;een of &s;en&s;ible clever People being put to the Blu&s;h, and to a Difficulty, by a &s;imple Que&s;tion pro|po&s;ed from a Per&s;on of inferior Talents, and be infinitely a&s;toni&s;hed at them&s;elves, that they should have been &s;o long igno|rant of &s;o plain a Matter.</P>
<P>If I have a Letter from you by this Day's Po&s;t, which I look for, I will add a Po&s;t&s;cript. Pray &s;ee that the enclo&s;ed be immediately put into the Penny-Po&s;t.</P>

<P>YOUR Letter ju&s;t now came to my Hand. I find that, which I wrote you this Day Se'nnight, is mi&s;carried. I enclo&s;ed <HI>the Cook-Maid's Letter</HI> in it, and, If I am not mi&s;taken, &s;ent it un|der Mr. K &mdash;'s Cover. Perhaps he con|&s;igned it to the Penny-Po&s;t, and it has been mi&s;laid or neglected there. It is worth your while to enquire at the little Office near you; and if it be entirely gone, I will &s;end you another Copy of the Poem. I mentioned therein that I would &s;end you a Letter of Introduc|tion
<PB N="98" REF="99">
to a Family at <HI>Richmond</HI>; and your not noticing this Particular, convinces me that &s;ame mu&s;t be what we have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Now to your Que&s;tions&mdash;</P>
<P>A <HI>Rap</HI> is a Blow, and likewi&s;e a ba&s;e Coin u&s;ed in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Whigs</HI> are for de&s;troying the <HI>Church,</HI> or at lea&s;t, for reducing it. The Tories are for exalting it. <HI>Down with the Church,</HI> and <HI>Up with the Church,</HI> were frequent Expre&s;&s;ions with the re&s;pective Parties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mill-Dam</HI> is the Place where they keep a Re&s;ervoir of Water, to &s;et
<PB N="99" REF="100">
the Mill going. Ob&s;erve though this is only for Water-Mills, and the Sound, you know, pretty near that of a vulgar Oath.</P>
<P><HI>Pinking</HI> is making &s;mall Holes. This was more in U&s;e, at the Time of the old Engli&s;h Habit, when the Doublets for Men were laced, as Stays are for Women. Captain <HI>Bluff,</HI> in <HI>Congreve,</HI> you know, &s;ays, <HI>I'll pink his Soul,</HI> in Allu&s;ion to this Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The Ana-Bapti&s;ts are not baptized till they come to Years of Di&s;cretion, and then they are plunged, not &s;prinkled. The fir&s;t Part of the Word is adopted from the Greek, <GAP DESC="foreign">, which &s;ignifies again&s;t, or contrary. Thus they are
<PB N="100" REF="101">
<HI>again&s;t</HI> baptizing, till &s;uch an Advance of Life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mortuary-Guinea</HI> is the Par&s;on's Due at Burials, for reading the Service, Church-yard Fees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is derived from the Latin Word <HI>Mors,</HI> which means <HI>Death</HI>; thence too we have <HI>mortal.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;hall have all the Poems you write of. In the mean Time, I &s;end <HI>The Ele|phant,</HI> and <HI>Aye and No</HI>; which I believe will plea&s;e you much.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Write to you &s;o often, and you write to me &s;o &s;eldom, that I am afraid you begin to be tired with the Corre|&s;pondence, but hope my Fears are groundle&s;s. I a&s;&s;ure you it is not every one I would take &s;o much Pains for. I thought that the Want of Amu&s;ements in <HI>London,</HI> at this Sea&s;on of the Year, would have rendered my frequent Writ|ing a &s;ort of Diver&s;ion to you, and, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, an Amends for the Lo&s;s of others. In order to make this Diver|&s;ion as agreeable and in&s;tructive as I am
<PB N="102" REF="103">
able, I have tran&s;cribed &s;everal Poems, &s;uch as I thought would be&s;t contribute to both the&s;e Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>You have Talents &s;o capable of Cul|tivation, that to be weary of receiving In|&s;truction, would argue an Ingratitude to Nature, and I cannot think you liable to it. Perhaps I write too often, per|haps I burthen you with a Frequency of Subjects; or perhaps a little La&s;&s;itude and Inattention comes over you now and then, which, at your Time of Life, are excu&s;able, if not indulged too far. If that be the Ca&s;e, confe&s;s. Such Omi&s;|&s;ions call, at wor&s;t, for the milde&s;t Re|proof; but, I cannot help &s;aying, they would become many young Folks better than you.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">Convinced that you cannot be pur|po&s;ely negligent, I &s;hall proceed in the old Way. I herewith &s;end <HI>Mary the Cook-Maid's Letter to Dr. Sheridan,</HI> and <HI>The Grove,</HI> tran&s;lated from <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido,</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Ro&s;common.</HI> This is one of the be&s;t Pictures of a happy Life that I have ever &s;een; true Content and true Love, virtuous and innocent, are here delineated in their native beautiful Co|lours. I &s;hall &s;end you two or three more Poems which I think equal to the former, when I next write, and then re&s;t awhile, or turn to &s;ome other Subject. I will not hurry you at all. I reque&s;t that you will write only when you have Lei&s;ure, and be at Pains to do it in a right Manner. You have gain|ed great E&s;teem by &s;o doing, for &s;ome
<PB N="104" REF="105">
Time pa&s;t; do not now begin to for|feit it.</P>
<P>If there be any Pa&s;&s;ages or Expre&s;&s;ions in what I &s;end, which require an Eclair|ci&s;&s;ement, let me know &s;o much, and I will explain them to you, as fully as I am able.

<P>I Have ju&s;t now received your Letter, and am very &s;orry for your ill For|tune; but as this Day and ye&s;terday have been pretty &s;ea&s;onable, and as the Wea|ther &s;eems to be &s;ettled, I hope it will now make you &s;ome little Amends. If
<PB N="115" REF="116">
not, you mu&s;t endure with Patience, or return home ungratified.</P>
<P>You will po&s;&s;ibly think me a very cold dull Philo&s;opher, to preach up Patience and Forbearance to a Per&s;on at your Time of Life. I confe&s;s they are hard Le&s;|&s;ons to learn at any Time, but e&s;pecially &s;o while the Heart is gay, the Pa&s;&s;ions warm, and Wi&s;hes impetuous. Permit me, however, to make one &s;hort Ob&s;er|vation, which may, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, qualify tho&s;e impatient irk&s;ome Sen&s;a|tions that ari&s;e from Di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>The great Rea&s;on why Di&s;appoint|ments &s;it more unea&s;y on young Folks, than on Per&s;ons advanced in Life, is, that the former a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of a

propo&s;ed Enjoyment, beyond the Power of Chance to prevent it. They no more advert to the Po&s;&s;ibility of a cro&s;s Acci|dent, than if there were no &s;uch Thing in Nature. Now methinks it is ea&s;y to remember that there is &s;uch a Thing as a Di&s;appointment, as well as a Delight.

<P>I Received yours of the 15th ju&s;t now.

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad my la&s;t arrived &s;afe, and that you have had the Satisfaction of &s;eeing &s;ome Things about <HI>Richmond</HI> worth Ob&s;ervation. I &s;hould be plea&s;ed if your Mama would let, you &s;tay a lit|tle longer, as you &s;eem to like it &s;o well; I think too it would be of Service to
<PB N="123" REF="126">
both your Healths. You may give my Re&s;pects, and &s;ay I join in the Reque&s;t that &s;he would grant this Indulgence.</P>
<P>I don't know the Adventures you &s;peak of; but why not buy the Book, if you can|not borrow or hire it? I would rather you &s;hould do &s;o, than have your Curio&s;ity left ungratified; and as I know the pru|dent Motive that has re&s;trained you from making the Purcha&s;e, I beg you will let me be at the Charge of all &s;uch Books as you wi&s;h &s;hould compo&s;e your little Library. But you need not be quite &s;o much at a Lo&s;s where you are. Mr. O&mdash;y has a good Collection of Authors, and if you will a&s;k the Favour, I am &s;ure he will lend you any you de&s;ire, or let you come and chu&s;e for your&s;elf. But
<PB N="124" REF="127">
then you mu&s;t take great Care of what you have, and regularly return one when you wi&s;h for another, otherwi&s;e you will find him reluctant. Some Per&s;ons would perhaps accu&s;e him herein of being par|ticular, but it is a Particularity which I have frequently &s;een; and why &s;hould a Compliance with it be deemed hard, &s;ince it is no more than is con&s;i&s;tent with common good Manners? Lovers of read|ing very often take up a capricious Fond|ne&s;s for their own Books; and, in Ca&s;e of an Author being lo&s;t, it is not always that a new, and perhaps neater, Edition will make Amends.</P>
<P>I have &s;een Lord <HI>Cholmondeley</HI>'s fine Room, but it was not fini&s;hed when I &s;aw it.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="128">The <HI>Cloud</HI> was written by Dr. <HI>Sheri|dan,</HI> I think, but the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> by Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> The latter is, in my Opinion, much the wittie&s;t, &s;o I have &s;ent it en|clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I hope your Stay will be prolonged, for you will not ea&s;ily forgive your&s;elf, if you do not &s;ee <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and the fine Cartoons of the immortal <HI>Ra|phael.</HI> The Stair-Cafe, and the Beauties of King <HI>William</HI>'s Court, are well worth your Notice, as are the Lodge and Ca&s;|cade in <HI>Bu&s;hy Park. Ham Walks</HI> will al&s;o give you great Plea&s;ure, but of ano|ther Kind. The former will rather rai&s;e your Wonder, (I mean the Court and Paintings) the latter in&s;pire with a &s;oft Delight. You will be more at home
<PB N="126" REF="129">
here, as you are happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater Reli&s;h for the humble, than the exalted Scenes of Life. Hence you will feel much Indulgence, I believe, in pa&s;&s;|ing through my favourite Village, <HI>Ted|dington.</HI></P>
<P>I have now done with Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> and &s;hall, by way of Foil, &s;end you the <HI>De|&s;cription of a Lady's Dre&s;&s;ing-Room,</HI> which is an Imitation (but far inferior) of the Doctor's Way of Writing; however you may, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, learn <HI>what to avoid,</HI> by reading it. There are many Things in that Part of <HI>Ovid's Art of Love,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> has translated, worth noticing, in order to a Lady's making her&s;elf agreeable, be&s;ides the cri|minal Part.

carefully and judiciou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed (and you are very capable of doing it) from the truly-u&s;eful and allowable, nay commendable Precepts, which he lays down.</P>
<P>After &s;ending you &s;ome few Reflections on <HI>Swift</HI>'s Way of Writing, I will turn to <HI>Horace</HI> next.

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the Plea&s;ure of yours of the 22d in&s;tant. No Letters go from this on Saturday, &s;o I could not an&s;wer you &s;ooner.</P>
<P>If the Weather prove fair this Week, I &s;uppo&s;e you will go to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> where I think you had better &s;tay a Night, that you may &s;ee every thing at Lei&s;ure. All the Places I wrote you of are in your Way. Let me &s;cheme for you.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132">I would go by Water to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> return the next Morning on Foot, (it is a plea&s;ant Walk) through the Park, to <HI>Teddington,</HI> there take Water to <HI>Ham Hou&s;e</HI> and from that walk to <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>Now your Mama and you have got to &s;o plea&s;ant a Spot, methinks I would have you &s;tay &s;ome Time. As I &s;aid be|fore, it will improve your Health and Spirits. If you are come abroad with Finances too narrow for this, let me know, and I can give you a Draught on Mr. O&mdash;y. He is my Banker; all my Monies go through his Hands, &s;o there is nothing improper or inconve|nient in it.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="133">I am much delighted with your deli|cate Rea&s;ons for declining my Offer of furni&s;hing you with Books; but you are too nice. Any thing in my Power, my dear Nancy, that may contribute either to your Health or Plea&s;ure, I think well be&s;towed, that is to &s;ay, while you are &s;o de&s;erving in every Re&s;pect. Per|haps I might do the &s;ame, were your Merit not quite equal to what it is, but not with the &s;ame good Will; and I know your Di&s;po&s;ition would &s;corn to be obliged, when you thought you did not de&s;erve the Obligation.</P>
<P>As I told you in my la&s;t, Mr. O&mdash;y, I am &s;ure, will let you have any Book you de&s;ire. If you could find the Life of <HI>Guzman d' Alfarache,</HI> I think it would
<PB N="131" REF="134">
entertain you. I well remember, when I was young, it entertained me.</P>
<P>I expect to be called to <HI>London</HI> &s;ome Time next Month, but am not certain exactly when. You &s;hall know before I &s;et out. Now to what I propo&s;ed about Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI></P>
<P>Although <HI>Swift</HI> was a very nice Judge of Mankind, (I mean herein to include both Sexes) and con&s;equently found many Things to cen&s;ure, and might po&s;|&s;ibly, on that Account, have too great a Contempt for the Generality of the World, yet we mu&s;t not thence con|clude, that he was either a Man-Hater or a Woman-Hater. He wanted only to correct Vices; and though he launched
<PB N="132" REF="135">
into per&s;onal Satire again&s;t many parti|ticular Men, (who, I believe, de&s;erved it at his Hands) yet I do not remember that he has been guilty of the &s;ame again&s;t the fair Sex.</P>
<P>In the next Place it may be ob&s;erved, that he has perhaps painted his Charac|ters <HI>larger than the Life,</HI> as the Painters phra&s;e it; but this is often nece&s;&s;ary, to make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion, as Figures larger than the Life mu&s;t be adopted &s;ometimes in Painting and Statuary, for the very &s;ame Purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially when placed at a great Di&s;tance. But who|ever reads his Works attentively, will find that his Characters, though &s;ome|times too &s;trong, are neverthele&s;s per|fectly natural.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136">His Satire or Cen&s;ure of your Sex has various Sources. It is &s;ometimes drawn from Faults incident to the Sex in gene|ral; that is to &s;ay, Faults, or rather Weakne&s;&s;es, which Women are more &s;ubject to than Men, and which may be &s;aid to ari&s;e from the Sex it&s;elf; for Example, Fear, Whims, and idle Fan|cies. The&s;e, you &s;ee, he wi&s;hes to era|dicate from their Minds.</P>
<P>At other Times his Satire ari&s;es from Faults, to which your Mode of Edu|cation expo&s;es you; namely, Affectation, Di&s;&s;embling, Tittle-Tattle, amu&s;ing your|&s;elves with Trifles of Dre&s;s, Colours, Shapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which indeed you are not to be blamed your&s;elves, but the Per&s;ons are, who have had the Care of your Youth.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="137">Some Faultine&s;&s;es which he arraigns, are tho&s;e that attend certain Times and Places, as Fa&s;hions; and I take the <HI>Mo|dern Lady</HI> to be of this Sort. Others are what this or that particular Woman runs into, which ari&s;e out of Affectation or Vanity, and wear, at the &s;ame Time, the Semblance of Virtue. Such is the Cha|racter of <HI>Artime&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the Author had &s;ome parti|cular Woman in his View when he drew this Character, <HI>Phryne,</HI> and <HI>Sappho,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o po&s;&s;ibly had Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> when he drew <HI>Doris</HI> and <HI>Amoret,</HI> but then they take Care not to expo&s;e any one. Of all the&s;e, I think <HI>Amoret</HI> the nice&s;t; be|cau&s;e her Faults are hardly di&s;tingui&s;h|able from Virtue, and &s;uch as are mo&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="138">
likely to impo&s;e not only on the World, but even on the Per&s;on who has them; and I do &s;ay, a Girl of good Sen&s;e and a virtuous Di&s;po&s;ition, is not in &s;o much Danger of becoming <HI>Phryne</HI> or <HI>Doris,</HI> or even <HI>Artime&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Sappho,</HI> as &s;he is of be|coming an <HI>Amoret.</HI> The la&s;t Stanza of this little Poem, namely,
<Q><L>She likes her&s;elf, yet others hates,</L>
<L>For that which in her&s;elf &s;he prizes,</L>
<L>And while &s;he laughs at them, forgets&punc;</L>
<L>She is the Thing which &s;he de&s;pi&s;es,</L></Q>
is the mo&s;t judicious and mo&s;t true Re|mark I ever read on the Sex, and yet the lea&s;t noticed. By the bye, it may very often be applied to our Sex as well as yours, and with as much Propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="139">Thus you &s;ee the <HI>Doctor</HI> has &s;hewn your Sex what they ought to &s;hun, in &s;ome Poems, and what they ought to be, in others; namely, in his <HI>Biddy Floyd, a Lady at Court, Stella,</HI> Mrs. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 27, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not yet got Time to make a Copy of <HI>The Dre&s;&s;ing-Room</HI> for you, but &s;hall do it by the next Po&s;t-Day, and then to <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides what I mentioned in my la&s;t Letter relative to female Faults, there are &s;ome which proceed from the Condition of Life. Women, by their Con&s;titu|tion, by their Frame of Body and Mind, are more formed for Subjection, than Men are. Some People indeed have di&s;|puted this, but it has been rather to &s;hew their Wit and Parts, than for any other
<PB N="138" REF="141">
Purpo&s;e, for the Fact is too evident to be denied. Allowing it to be &s;o, there are then &s;ome Temptations which ari&s;e from the Condition of the Sex. A De&s;ire of Rule, or perhaps of having their Will, which is as &s;trong in many Women as in Men, naturally incites them to find out &s;ome crafty Methods to obtain it. By the Prerogative of our Sex, we go a &s;horter and more direct Way to work. Some ma&s;culine Women do the &s;ame, e&s;pecially when they meet with &s;oft, ea&s;y, womani&s;h Men; but, for the mo&s;t Part, it is otherwi&s;e. Women then, I &s;ay, who are de&s;irous of Sway, are re|duced to peculiar Contrivances to obtain it: they mu&s;t apply to Art and Cunning, to wheedling or teazing, according to the Temper of the Per&s;ons they have to
<PB N="139" REF="142">
deal with. I do not mean to infer from this, that Women are by Nature more in&s;incere, more cunning, flattering, or more affected than the Men, but that it is only the Condition, whereto the Di&s;advantage of their Sex reduces them, which is the Source and Origin of &s;uch indirect Practices. To confirm this, we may ob&s;erve that Children, (Boys I mean) wilt do the &s;elf &s;ame Thing, to obtain what they want from their Parents; &s;o will Servants, or any Inferiors, from their Ma&s;ters and Superiors. But Women, who have humane and rea&s;onable Hu&s;|bands, and who are rea&s;onable them|&s;elves, or are independent, (in either of which Ca&s;es the Condition is different from what I before de&s;cribed) are not chargeable with &s;uch Subtleties; I &s;ay,
<PB N="140" REF="143">
we do not &s;ee them make U&s;e of any of the&s;e little, though too often nece&s;&s;ary, Arts.</P>
<P>I fear I have tired you. I have dwelt too long on a Subject too grating to a female Ear; I &s;hall therefore only ob|&s;erve, that &s;ome Faults flow from the Sex, (are <HI>generical,</HI> if I may &s;o call them) more ari&s;e from Education, but mo&s;t from their Condition or Station in Life.</P>
<P>I think it is Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> who will not allow that there is &s;uch a Thing as ma&s;|culine and feminine Virtues. What is Virtue in a Man, is &s;o in a Woman, &s;ays he. I will not di&s;pute that Opinion, but I believe I may affirm, that there are Virtues, as well as Vices, in general,
<PB N="141" REF="144">
more &s;trongly implanted in the one Sex, than in the other; as for Example, Fear, Tenderne&s;s, Compa&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. in Women, and Intrepidity, Roughne&s;s, Hardine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Men. There are moreover &s;ome Faults and Frailties pardonable in the one Sex, which are abominable in the other.</P>
<P>A young Fellow who rambles about, and runs Riot, is ea&s;ily forgiven; if a young Woman &s;hould do &s;o, &s;he is gone at once. As <HI>Rowe</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>She &s;ets, like Stars that fall, to ri&s;e no more.</Q>
I do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay but that the World is rather unju&s;t to be &s;o indul|gent on the one Hand, and &s;o &s;evere on the other; but that is no Kind of Alle|viation
<PB N="142" REF="145">
to the young Woman who ex|po&s;es her&s;elf to &s;uch Danger.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome In&s;tances on the other Hand. If a Woman is frighted at Trifles or Shadows, &s;he is compa&s;&s;ionated; a Man &s;o circum&s;tanced, would be ridi|culed. If Women put on affected Airs, or are over-&s;olicitous about their Dre&s;s and Appearance, at wor&s;t they are de|&s;pi&s;ed perhaps only pitied; but let a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be guilty of &s;uch Things, he is dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>The&s;e Hints, my dear, were occa|&s;ioned by the Poems I &s;ent you.

<P>AT my Return to this Place, my dear Nancy, I received yours of the 13th of July, and ye&s;terday I had another of the 5th in&s;tant. I cannot ac|count for the Letter having been five Days on the Road.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="150">Your being taken &s;ick upon your Tour mu&s;t be both a Di&s;appointment and In|convenience. I hope however your Di&s;|order will not increa&s;e. If it &s;hould, and you are unable to write, beg your Mama to favour me with a Line, as you may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall otherwi&s;e be kept in a very unea&s;y Su&s;pence.</P>
<P>Suffer me here to trouble you with a little Caution, which however I cannot think you &s;tand in Need of. There is an idle Cu&s;tom, wherein too many of your Sex indulge them&s;elves, which ought to be carefully guarded again&s;t; I mean that of complaining for Trifles, and endeavouring to impo&s;e a flight In|di&s;po&s;ition for a material Illne&s;s. Some

Ladies who follow this Practice, per|haps would never dream of doing it of their own Accords, but they have &s;een the Affectation in others, and fancied it became them; thus they are guilty of that through Imitation, which they would never have been through Prin|ciple. Such Per&s;ons draw on them&s;elves one Inconvenience at lea&s;t, namely, that of not being credited, when they are really ill.</P>
<P>To divert you, I will quote a Pa&s;|&s;age out of <HI>Horace,</HI> &s;omewhat &s;imilar to this. I own the Tran&s;lation to be very indifferent, but the Sen&s;e is ex|cellent.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h there were a good Tran&s;lation of <HI>Horace,</HI> for your Sake, but it is what I de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing: however, I would have you acquainted with him even in &s;uch Tran&s;lation as we have. I will get you the be&s;t I can very &s;oon.
<PB N="150" REF="153">
He is a Trea&s;ure that you would be glad to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and though you may reli&s;h him but indifferently, as he is given in our Language, yet it is better than not to be acquainted with him at all.</P>
<P>I do not know how long it may be before I &s;ee <HI>London.</HI> If you are willing therefore, we will &s;upply the Ab&s;ence as u&s;ual, by Letter, and perhaps to better Advantage than if we were together.</P>

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> Since writing the above, I have a Letter from Mr. K&mdash;, and one from you, about the Parcel of Snuff you have been &s;o good to &s;end me. I thank you very kindly. Such little Remembrances are endearing, and &s;ometimes more &s;o than material Services; &s;ince the latter are generally called out by &s;ome occasional Claim of Exigency, whereas the former are the Re&s;ult of a con&s;tant Attention and Inclination to oblige. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have a pretty Adage, or Proverb, to this Pur|po&s;e, which means,
<Q>Civility co&s;ts little, and gains much.</Q></P>

did not befal me. It is true, the poor Servant was drowned, by the Boat over&s;etting. Mr. L&mdash; was got out, without any Damage. I was not in the Boat. I have neither mentioned it in writing, nor talked of it to any one, when I could avoid it. Such Events, I think, are painful to the Hearer as well as the Speaker; for this Rea&s;on, I did not hint it to Mr. K&mdash;.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours of the 23d, for which I am much obliged, &s;ince it brings me News of your Amendment. It may ap|pear odd to &s;ay, I am now very glad to be informed that you have been <HI>verita|blement malade</HI>; as I would rather that a
<PB N="154" REF="157">
Per&s;on, for whom I entertain &s;uch a high E&s;teem, as I do for you, &s;hould be lo&s;t to Health, than lo&s;t to Truth. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e as ours, however, I know the Generality of the World would not call it a Fal&s;hood, only an Equivocation; but &s;urely, in&s;tead of mending the Matter, this is only making it wor&s;e; the Fault is the &s;ame, with the Aggravation of Meanne&s;s. We &s;ee frequent In&s;tances hereof in the common Occurrences of Life, and People are either in&s;en&s;ible, or regardle&s;s of them. But call the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion what by Name you will, &s;till it is &s;uch as I thought you incapable of, and am plea&s;ed to be confirmed in my Opi|nion; though by your calling my Quo|tation from <HI>Horace</HI> a bitter Pill, you cer|tainly &s;trained it to a Meaning I did not
<PB N="155" REF="158">
intend you &s;hould. I had &s;ome Su&s;pi|cion of this when I wrote it. However, I cho&s;e to leave it for you to comment on, and for my&s;elf to defend afterwards, which I thus do.</P>
<P>Every Fable has, or may have, a ge|neral, as well as a particular Applica|tion. Our Story &s;hews the Danger of People u&s;ing fal&s;e Pretences, on various Occa&s;ions, and thereby running a Ri&s;que of not being believed, when they &s;peak truth. This is the general Moral or Ap|plication. The particular Moral is &s;pe|cified in the kept Woman lo&s;ing her Cre|dit with her Friend, by pretending eter|nal Wants and Lo&s;&s;es; a Hanger-on with his Retainer; and a Beggar with the Pa&s;|&s;enger. Now you cho&s;e to introduce a
<PB N="156" REF="159">
particular Application to your own Ill|ne&s;s, which I thought I had guarded again&s;t in my Premi&s;al to the Quotation. It &s;eems you did not think &s;o, and there was no Harm in it; it was but the na|tural Re&s;ult of a &s;trong and a nice Feel|ing; and, were it an Error, I would rea|dily take it on my&s;elf, being, as I am, the Source of it; and again a&s;&s;ure you I meant only to amu&s;e, not to reproach you.</P>
<P>I have bought <HI>Horace</HI> for you; but the Tran&s;lation being very indifferent, many Allu&s;ions made to Roman Cu&s;|toms, and Roman Names of People and Places introduced, I fear it will read very heavily. You would neverthele&s;s find it worth your while to put up with
<PB N="157" REF="160">
the former, and be at &s;ome extraordinary Pains to make your&s;elf acquainted with the others, for the Sake of the prudent Sayings, Advices, Maxims, and Reflec|tions, wherewith the Author abounds. In &s;hort, you mu&s;t, for once, be contented with the <HI>utile</HI> without the <HI>dulce,</HI> for the latter is all left behind with the Ori|ginal. It will &s;omewhat re&s;emble a whole&s;ome Pill, without any Gilding.</P>
<P>There is another Author I want to make you acquainted with, and that is <HI>Longinus on the Sublime.</HI> I will get one for you, and &s;end it with <HI>Horace.</HI> Ob|&s;erve, my dear, while I am recommend|ing the&s;e to you, I have no De&s;ign to induce you to &s;et up for a Critic, or a female Pedant, only to enable you to
<PB N="158" REF="161">
know the Extent of your own Judg|ment, and how to correct and regulate it to your Profit and Plea&s;ure. For this Purpo&s;e merely it is that I wi&s;h to make you acquainted with &s;ome of the be&s;t Writers of Antiquity, who accu|rately di&s;tingui&s;h between Sen&s;e and Non-&s;en&s;e, true and fal&s;e Wit, Humour and Farce, Sublime and Bomba&s;t, a noble Flight and a Rant, a graceful Complaint and an unbecoming Whining.</P>
<P>The melancholy Accident, which you enquire about, happened in the follow|ing Manner.</P>
<P>We were at a Treat which a new Comer to the Hall gives to the other Students. It
<PB N="159" REF="162">
was at the celebrated Place, called God-&s;tow where <HI>Fair Ro&s;amond,</HI> the Favourite of Henry II. was buried. A Branch of the I&s;is runs there, which at <HI>London</HI> is called the <HI>Thames.</HI> There is a Bridge of two Arches; the one was &s;topped up, in order to catch Fi&s;h there, &s;o the whole Stream was thrown into the other. Mr. L&mdash; had taken his Servant into his Boat, and was endeavouring to pu&s;h through the Arch, which he had, at other Times, done without Difficulty; but, on this Occa&s;ion, the Impetuo&s;ity of the Current &s;uddenly drove the Boat back with great Violence; Mr. L&mdash; &s;tumbling again&s;t his Servant, they were both thrown for|cibly on the Edge of the Boat, and oc|ca&s;ioned it to be &s;o far overbalanced, as to be filled with Water. Apprehen&s;ive
<PB N="160" REF="163">
that the Boat would immediately &s;ink, Mr. L&mdash; jumped out, and was taken up without the lea&s;t Harm; but the Servant, &s;taying longer by the Boat, was drove further from the Bank, and being unable to &s;wim, he unfortunately &s;unk, before the Boat, which took up his Ma&s;ter, could reach him. They once or twice got a Pole under him, but could not &s;ave him. I did not &s;ee the fir&s;t Part of the Misfortune, for I was not come out from Dinner, but arrived Time enough to &s;ee Mr. L&mdash; taken up, and the poor Man lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have gratified your Curio&s;ity, but you need not tell the Story out of your Family. There is &s;omething very &s;hocking in the Idea of a poor Creature being &s;natched
<PB N="161" REF="164">
thus from Life, in an In&s;tant, and, as <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>With all his Imperfections on his Head,</Q>
and Calamities like the&s;e &s;hould &s;erve as a Warning to us all, to lead &s;uch Lives, as might be&s;t enable us to meet &s;uch. Deaths, if called on.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have ju&s;t now received yours of the 26th. Some Mi&s;takes have happened between us about Dates, which we can|not
<PB N="162" REF="165">
ea&s;ily &s;ettle, I find, and &s;ome Mi&s;|carriages in the Po&s;t, which we cannot repair; therefore I do not hold it worth our while to enter into a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion about them. Time ill-employed is worse than Time unemployed, and the la&s;t is bad enough in all Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The entire Occa&s;ion of my writing ju&s;t now is to tell you that I go into the Country, to <HI>Tew,</HI> to-morrow early, and &s;hall not return for two or three Days. When I do, I &s;hall &s;end you <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Longinus.</HI> You are probably thinking of their Arrival now; I therefore hold it nece&s;&s;ary to make an Apology for not gra|tifying the Expectation I have rai&s;ed. It is, in &s;ome Degree, like not paying a Debt which we have voluntarily con|tracted.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="166">You promi&s;ed to read tho&s;e Books in the Holy Scriptures, and the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> which I recommended, and to let me have your Thoughts of them.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JUST now I have the Plea&s;ure of yours. I have been hurried ever &s;ince I wrote you la&s;t. I am this Even|ing returned to Town, and mu&s;t leave it again early to-morrow Morning.</P>
<P>My pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ions a &s;econd Di&s;appointment in the Books I promi&s;ed. They cannot come till I return; but, believe me, you &s;hould not wait &s;o long for them, if it were in my Power to prevent it. I have known People who made a Point of baulking young Folks
<PB N="165" REF="168">
of Pre&s;ents and Enjoyments that had been promi&s;ed them, from a prudent De&s;ign (as they termed it) of inuring them early to Di&s;appointments. I hold it the mo&s;t dangerous Way of proceed|ing in the World. Be&s;ide that it will never an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed (for it will be much more likely the Temper &s;hould be hurt than improved by it) it is practi&s;ing Cunning and low Artifice with them; &s;etting them a bad Exam|ple; for as &s;oon as they are old enough to di&s;cover the Means you u&s;e, they will be induced to practi&s;e the &s;ame with you, and endeavour to counteract one Craft by another. Hence they are early &s;e|duced from the fir&s;t great Principle of Goodne&s;s, Truth, and by Degrees all that is open and ingenuous in the Mind
<PB N="166" REF="169">
may be quenched, ere they know the Value of it.</P>
<P>If I return on Tue&s;day, your Books &s;hall be &s;ent on Wedne&s;day; if I do not, you cannot have them till Friday. Wait with Patience till then, and I think you need not wait longer. I be|lieve <HI>Longinus</HI> will give you great Sati&s;|faction. Our Corre&s;pondence about Books, and Ob&s;ervations on them, has been long interrupted. I care not now how &s;oon it is re&s;umed; but it &s;hall be at your own Choice. I will not hurry you.</P>
<P>I have one Letter more to write about Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Genius, and then I have en|tirely done with that Subject. I promi&s;ed,
<PB N="167" REF="170">
'tis true, to let you have what <HI>Horace</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ays of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> but as I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;end you the Book it&s;elf, that Promi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;uper&s;eded.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have now received the Books. <HI>Longinus</HI> is a mo&s;t admirable Au|thor, but he will require a deep Atten|tion in reading. I advi&s;e you to ob&s;erve the Notes as you go along; not leave them till la&s;t. When you have made your&s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of them, read the Book through again. This will give you a very competent Knowledge of him, and your Plea&s;ure will be increa&s;ed in Pro|portion. A real good Author, you know, like a real good. Man, improves on our

You will give me your Opinion of the whole, in due Time. When you enter upon <HI>Horace,</HI> you mu&s;t make great Allowance for the Stile, the Mea&s;ure of his Ver&s;e, and yet more for the weak Expre&s;&s;ion in which the origi|nal Sen&s;e and Meaning is given.</P>
<P>This Minute yours of the 9th. Never delay writing, becau&s;e Franks are want|ing. I hold &s;uch a Con&s;ideration un|worthy to be put in Balance with a Let|ter from a Friend. Po&s;tage is cheap enough; and your Corre&s;pondence is dear to me.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="175">I cannot &s;ay when I am to be in <HI>Lon|don.</HI> You will have another little Parcel &s;oon, containing &s;ome Buckles and other Nece&s;&s;aries, which Mr. K&mdash; de&s;ired me to procure for him.

<P>I Have the Plea&s;ure of yours of the 13th, and am glad to hear you got the Things &s;afe, and that your good Mama is better. You have one of the greate&s;t Comforts and Ble&s;&s;ings of this Life, a good Parent; and indeed you are one of the few young Folks who de&s;erve the Ble&s;&s;ing, in-as-much as you are &s;en&s;ible of it, and, by your Conduct towards her, prove you are grateful for it.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Saturday la&s;t I &s;ent you a Letter by Dr. <HI>King</HI>'s Servant, which I hope you have received &s;afe.</P>
<P>For the&s;e three Months pa&s;t, I have employed my &s;pare Hours in reading &s;uch
<PB N="179" REF="182">
Authors as have wrote on Poetry; for Example, <HI>Horace, Boileau's and Vida's Art of Poetry, Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, the Duke of Buckingham's E&s;&s;ay on Poetry, and Lord Ro&s;common's E&s;&s;ay on tran&s;lated Ver&s;e.</HI> I have al&s;o been at the Pains to make Ab&s;tracts from them all, and this for two Rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, to make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind, &s;econdly, to have them to recur to, on Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid once before, I would not have you &s;et up for a Critic; but as Nature has implanted in you a Love and Ta&s;te for reading, I could wi&s;h you, at this Lei&s;ure-Time of your Life, to ac|quire as right a Judgment as you can of what you read, and be able to conver&s;e upon it. But your own Di&s;cretion mu&s;t
<PB N="180" REF="183">
be your Monitor, not to let the&s;e Studies engage your Time and Attention, to the Neglect of &s;uch dome&s;tic Qualifica|tions, as your Sex and Situation may hereafter demand.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent you a loo&s;e Ab&s;tract of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham's E&s;&s;ay,</HI> and, if you de&s;ire them, will furni&s;h you with Ab&s;tracts of the re&s;t. This may, at fir&s;t View, appear an u&s;ele&s;s Trouble to one who has the Originals at Hand, but, in Fact, is not &s;o; it may be of the &s;ame U&s;e to you, that it was to me; and you will &s;till have a much &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion of any Rule or Pa&s;&s;age, by writing your Remarks to me, or adding what is de|fective to mine; for, as I did them ha&s;ti|ly,
<PB N="181" REF="184">
no Doubt, many Things want to be corrected.</P>
<P>Shall I give you a &s;hort Character of the Authors I have named?</P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> is always allowed the fir&s;t Place. Notwith&s;tanding he &s;lides over Things in a &s;hort, ea&s;y, carele&s;s Way, &s;carce &s;eeming to ob&s;erve any Order, yet he requires a great deal of Attention. <HI>Ro&s;common</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of him is good, though <HI>Oldham</HI>'s loo&s;e Manner gives us mo&s;t Plea&s;ure. This Author has al&s;o been tran&s;lated by <HI>Ben Jon&s;on</HI> and &s;everal others.</P>
<P><HI>Vida</HI> &s;tands next. He does not med|dle with the different Kinds of Poetry,
<PB N="182" REF="185">
only with Poetry in general, and chiefly applies what he &s;ays to the <HI>Epic.</HI> He is more full, regular, and methodical, than any of them. He points out how a Youth of Genius &s;hould be trained in the Art of Poetry; and treats of many Things, which none of the others, whom I have named, have touched upon; all in &s;uch excellent Ver&s;e, and &s;o &s;uited to the Na|ture of his Subjects, that the Sound is in Reality "an Echo to the Sen&s;e." The Original is in Latin. I am not certain whether he has been tran&s;lated, but will enquire; if he has, I will get him for you; but, at all Events, you mu&s;t com|pound for the Lo&s;s of his genuine Beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="186"><HI>Boileau</HI> is very judicious; he takes in all Kinds of Poetry, and borrows a great deal from <HI>Horace,</HI> but is more metho|dical.</P>
<P><HI>Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m</HI> is a con&s;um|mate Piece; but it is &s;o conci&s;e, that, like <HI>Horace,</HI> he demands clo&s;e Atten|tion. He borrows much from the three before-mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Ro&s;common</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI> are much &s;horter. They omit many Things which the others mention, but what they have written is finely executed. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t on Dramatic Writing. What he has &s;aid, though imperfect, is very judicious, and his Lines are ma&s;terly.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">On the whole, I have one Piece of Ad|vice for you; namely, that you would particularly ob&s;erve what they have in common with each other. By this Means you will be neare&s;t to the right.</P>
<P>No more, till I hear from you, which I hope will be &s;oon; but pray do not write, when you are in a Hurry.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have, on the other Leaf of this Let|ter, &s;ent you an Ab&s;tract of <HI>Lord Ro&s;|common's E&s;&s;ay on tran&s;lated Ver&s;e.</HI> If you
<PB N="185" REF="188">
will let the Ab&s;tract lye by you, while you go through the Work it&s;elf, it will a&s;&s;i&s;t you to di&s;tingui&s;h one Rule from another, and implant them &s;till deeper in your Mind.</P>
<P>This Author will particularly define <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy,</HI> and enable you to form a proper Judgment of them.</P>
<P>I need not ob&s;erve to you that the fir&s;t general Qualification nece&s;&s;ary in all Kinds of Writing is good Sen&s;e. The peculiar Ingredients requi&s;ite for Tragedy are Terror and Pity, tho&s;e for Comedy are Wit and Humour. <HI>Corneille</HI> thought to bring a fourth into Tragedy, namely, Admiration; but it is not by any Means &s;o e&s;&s;ential as the former. It will &s;ome|times
<PB N="186" REF="189">
have its Effect, and act very agree|ably on the Mind, but Terror and Pity always have been, and always will be, allowed the main Ingredients.</P>
<P>In like Manner, Wit and Humour are nece&s;&s;ary to Comedy. The Prefe|rence between the&s;e is generally given to Humour, and I think very ju&s;tly. If Humour is that peculiar Mode of think|ing, and of &s;aying and doing Things, which &s;ome Per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s, and are thereby di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others, then it mu&s;t be the chief Ingredient in Comedy. Mo&s;t People are endued with this Talent in a greater or le&s;s Degree; and it is not uncommon to &s;ee the Hap|pine&s;s or Unhappine&s;s of Life depend on this peculiar Ca&s;t of Mind and of Be|haviour.
<PB N="187" REF="190">
<HI>Congreve</HI> has an excellent Letter on Humour in Comedy. Pray read it.</P>
<P>Wit a&s;&s;uredly claims only the &s;econd Place. Complaints have been made of too much Wit in &s;ome of our Co|medy-Writers, in <HI>Congreve,</HI> for In&s;tance. If any one merits the Charge, he mu&s;t be the Man; but I am afraid it is generally rather fal&s;e Wit, or &s;omething mi&s;taken for Wit, which is complained of. There are very few Authors, however, who can be arraigned of this Fault; though I have heard <HI>Terence</HI> and <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the Li&s;t with <HI>Congreve.</HI></P>
<P>True Wit is hard to be defined. Some call it merely a Propriety of Thoughts and Words; but I think it rather is good
<PB N="188" REF="191">
Sen&s;e well expre&s;&s;ed. Others term it an A&s;&s;emblage of Ideas of very di&s;tinct and different Nature, yet capable of being &s;olved into an agreeable and unexpected Likene&s;s. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Compari&s;on of Re|ligion and Politics to Oil and Vinegar, is an In&s;tance in Point. But I think this ra|ther a Species, than a Definition of Wit. In my Opinion, Wit con&s;i&s;ts in an inge|nious Thought, cloathed in good Phra&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed with Liveline&s;s, and creative of Plea&s;ure and Mirth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious and plea&s;ant Friend of mine makes Tran&s;lation the Te&s;t of Wit. Will it, &s;ays he, &s;till continue Wit, if rendered into another Language? If it will, it is truly Wit&mdash;if not, it is only Humour.</NOTE>. If &s;o, it is an E&s;|&s;ential to Comedy. It recommends and enforces our Sentiments, which, how|&s;oever ju&s;t or important they may be,

<P>A Comedy with too much Wit in it has been compared to a Suit of Cloaths, &s;o richly embroidered, as to pre|vent the Ground-Work being &s;een. I think however it is oftner Tin&s;el, than Sterling, of which we complain.</P>
<P>It has been objected to <HI>Congreve,</HI> that his very Servants and low Characters are
<PB N="191" REF="194">
witty. Why &s;hould they not be &s;o? Have we not &s;een &s;uch in real Life, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have acquired a little better Sort of Education; <HI>Jeremy</HI> in his <HI>Love for Love</HI> is de&s;cribed to have waited on a Gentleman at <HI>Cambridge</HI>; is there any Wonder &s;uch a Servant &s;hould be witty; or &s;uch as are bred in or near <HI>London,</HI> or in the Neighbourhood of the Court? I do not &s;ee why they may not be as witty as their Betters, as they often are.</P>
<P>He is again charged with having writ|ten bad Engli&s;h. He does &s;o &s;ometimes, but puts it in the Mouth of a low Cha|racter. He mu&s;t be a weak Ob&s;erver indeed, who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between the Character and the Author.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="195">Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf objects that Congreve's Fools are not Fools;
<Q><L>How &s;eldom do the be&s;t &s;ucceed!</L>
<L>Tell me if Congreve's Fools are Fools indeed.</L></Q>
In my humble Opinion, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;hould have con&s;idered that <HI>Congreve</HI> had de|clared, and ju&s;tly, again&s;t bringing er|rant Fools on the Stage, that is, &s;uch as are created &s;o. Why, for what End bring Per&s;ons there, who ought rather to be pitied than expo&s;ed? We might as ju&s;|tifiably reduce deaf or dumb People to Ridicule, as &s;uch Fools as the&s;e. Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> has an excellent Ob&s;ervation on this Head; he &s;ays, the Folly which de|&s;erves to be expo&s;ed, is procured
<Q><L>&mdash; &mdash; by Expence of Time and Thought,</L>
<L>God never made a Coxcomb worth a Groat,</L></Q>
<PB N="193" REF="196">
meaning to imply that Coxcombry mu&s;t proceed from Vanity, Pride, Affectation, or a wrong Ta&s;te,</P>
<P><HI>Congreve</HI> complains that his <HI>Witwou'd,</HI> in the <HI>Way of the World,</HI> was mi&s;taken by the Town for a <HI>True-Wit.</HI> The Er|ror was wholly theirs. His Judgment was too nice to &s;uffer him to draw gro&s;s Fools: his were of a refined Ca&s;t, and were Men, who had the Appearance, at lea&s;t, of &s;omething like Men of Sen&s;e. Of this Sort are <HI>Tattle, Petulant, Witwou'd,</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;k;</HI> though they are Fools enough at the Bottom; but neverthele&s;s are &s;uch to whom we &s;hould rather give the Ap|pellation of Fops or Coxcombs.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197">The Objection to <HI>Congreve,</HI> that his Fools are not Fools enough, is not half &s;o bad as if they had been too much &s;o. Surely the Town would not have wi&s;hed him to have brought either an Ideot or a Lunatick on the Stage. He has indeed brought a Counterfeit-Madman there, and <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> a real Madman, (in his Comedy of <HI>Bartholomew Fair)</HI> but not with an Intent to expo&s;e either the one or the other. If we con&s;ider the Con|duct of the Per&s;ons I have named, from their fir&s;t Entrance to the Time they leave the Stage, we &s;hall find them Fools enough in all Con&s;cience. <HI>Petulant</HI> and <HI>Wit|wou'd,</HI> for Example, can &s;eldom be a&s;un|der; they &s;peak ill of one another, when apart; they play at Snip Snap, and a rude Sort of bantering one another in Com|pany,
<PB N="195" REF="198">
and even before Strangers. They affect a &s;trange Sort of Cant; there is a kind of Pertne&s;s in all they &s;ay; their Repartee is lively, but &s;illy and unman|nerly; they get drunk, and come in that Pickle before their Mi&s;tre&s;s; they fall into an ab&s;urd Fit of wrangling, in which they both &s;peak rank Non&s;en&s;e; they &s;et up for being very &s;evere upon the Ladies; they give up their Preten|&s;ions to <HI>Millamant</HI> with as little Rea&s;on as they formed them; in a Word, they are a Couple of Coxcombs, approaching towards Wit and Breeding, but in Truth having neither. In&s;tead of good Sen&s;e, polite Wit, and genteel Repartee, they have a &s;ort of rude Bri&s;kne&s;s, and <HI>run the Rig,</HI> as the young Tem|plars,
<PB N="196" REF="199">
and &s;pruce Wits, call this Sort of joking.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought to have pur&s;ued the Sub|ject of my la&s;t Letter two Days ago, but had not Time. I now proceed to enquire what Wit is, and when it may be u&s;ed with Propriety.</P>
<P>Though I cannot give you a perfect Definition of Wit, (which perhaps is not to be done, the Word being &s;o va|riou&s;ly applied) yet I think we may de|fine in what Shape it generally appears. In the fir&s;t Place, Wit, in my Opinion,
<PB N="198" REF="201">
is good Sen&s;e; or, at lea&s;t, it is founded in good Sen&s;e, although there is &s;ome|thing more nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute it; for Example, Joco&s;ene&s;s, Sprightline&s;s, Ridi|cule; but above all, Aptne&s;s. The Time and Manner of applying it makes great Part of the Merit.</P>
<P>A good Pun pa&s;&s;es for Wit, with &s;ome Folks, but I fear it is no Way al|lied to it. A wild Expre&s;&s;ion carries the &s;ame Appearance with others, but if there be not &s;omething ingenious in it as well as wild, I doubt it will never de|&s;erve the Name of Wit.</P>
<P>Wit appears often in a &s;mart Repar|tee, if made off-Hand; Impromptu's,
<PB N="199" REF="202">
as the French call them. The&s;e are very entertaining, provided a fair Occa&s;ion of|fers, and the Per&s;on, who gives that Oc|ca&s;ion, de&s;erves the Smart. The Conver|&s;ation between <HI>Millamant</HI> and <HI>Marwood,</HI> in <HI>the Way of the World,</HI> is a lively In|&s;tance hereof. The former retorts on the latter with Abundance of Wit, Humour, and Satire.</P>
<P>I will give you one In&s;tance in a little Story where the Repartee was lively, and &s;evere, and de&s;erved, and immediately took its Ri&s;e from what had been &s;aid.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Judge Jefferies</HI> was notable at confounding and brow-beating Wit|ne&s;&s;es, as they call it, e&s;pecially when
<PB N="200" REF="203">
their Te&s;timonies were not agreeable to him. An old reverend Man, with a great Beard, was giving Evidence before him, when <HI>Jefferies,</HI> in Hope to put him out of Countenance, &s;aid, <Q>If that Fel|low's Con&s;cience is as large as his Beard, he may &s;wear what he plea&s;es.</Q> The Witne&s;s, taking hold of his Beard, gravely replied, <Q>Nay, my Lord, if you mea&s;ure Con&s;ciences by Beards, your Lord&s;hip has none at all.</Q></P>
<P>Thus introduced, Repartee &s;urely me|rits to be called Wit, and is not only an agreeable, but an u&s;eful Talent; but when it is exerci&s;ed again&s;t good-natured, inoffen&s;ive People, or &s;uch as are in Want or Affliction, it becomes dete&s;ta|ble,
<PB N="201" REF="204">
and rather de&s;erves the Name of Cru|elty. It is indeed as unmanly and cow|ardly in the&s;e Ca&s;es, as it would be to a&s;&s;ail with Violence one who had not a Weapon to defend him&s;elf, or if he had, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither Strength or Spirits to make U&s;e of it. And yet many &s;uch witty Fools are to be found, who chu&s;e to di&s;play their Talents on any Subject, rather than lo&s;e an Opportunity of &s;hew|ing them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Young,</HI> in his <HI>Love of Fame,</HI> di&s;plays an hone&s;t Indignation, at this cruel U&s;e of Wit, with great Energy&mdash; <Q><L>Who, for the poor Renown of being &s;mart,</L><L>Would leave a Sting within a Brother's Heart?</L></Q></NOTE>. One Comfort is, that they often feel the ill Effects them&s;elves; for Wit, improperly placed, is as apt to injure the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as a Gun, by recoiling, to
<PB N="202" REF="205">
brui&s;e an injudicious Shooter. Shall I illu&s;trate this by another little Anecdote?</P>
<P>A certain noble Roman was &s;tanding for one of their highe&s;t Offices; the Con|&s;ul&s;hip, I believe. The Election being popular, the Candidates were obliged to court the Freemen, as is practi&s;ed in our Country at every Election for a Seat in Parliament. All the Voters were care&s;&s;|ed. This Noble was &s;haking Hands with a poor labouring Man, and per|ceiving them to be very hard, "Friend," quoth he, with a Sneer, "do&s;t thou walk upon thy Hands?" The Man took the Wittici&s;m in Dudgeon, and had Re&s;ent|ment and Intere&s;t enough to make the Noble lo&s;e his Election.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="206">The famous Sir <HI>Thomas Sydenham,</HI> who was an extraordinary great Man in his Way, had &s;o indifferent an Opinion of Wit, that he u&s;ed to &s;ay, "There was almo&s;t as great a Difference between Wi&s;|dom and Wit, as between Something and Nothing." Yet I cannot agree with him. Wit, properly managed and tem|pered, may be rendered (as I &s;aid be|fore) an agreeable and u&s;eful Quality. We &s;hould only take Care not to let it get the better of good Sen&s;e, good Nature, good Humour, or good Man|ners.</P>
<P>I am about to &s;end you a Book, which contains the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s and Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI>'s Poems, and the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Reflections on Elo|quence.

<P>WIT deals occa&s;ionally in various Fi|gures of Speech, for Example, in Metonymy and Metaphor. As you have now read <HI>Longinus,</HI> I need not ex|plain tho&s;e Figures here.</P>
<P>He had Wit, who fir&s;t called <HI>u&s;ele&s;s Learning, learned Lumber.</HI> A very learn|ed Man has been termed a Magazine of Learning; but if that Learning be confu&s;ed and indige&s;ted, they aptly &s;ay, his Head is a Lumber-Hou&s;e of Learn|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="209">Religious Enthu&s;ia&s;ts pretend to, what they call, <HI>inward Light,</HI> as a Warrant to their Belief and Actions; whence <HI>Hudi|bras</HI> &s;ays, with great Wit,
<Q><L>'Tis a dark Lanthorn of the Spirit,</L>
<L>Which none &s;ee by, but tho&s;e that bear it;</L></Q>
intimating that their pretended Light, if it were u&s;eful at all, was not &s;o to any but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But Wit deals mo&s;t in Similies; that is, in drawing Likene&s;&s;es between Things of a different Nature; and the more &s;urprizing and unexpected tho&s;e Like|ne&s;&s;es are, and by how far the Things compared differ in their Kinds, by &s;o much more is the Wit prized. There is one of this Kind in <HI>Hudibras,</HI> which
<PB N="207" REF="210">
has been much admired, and often quoted. Speaking of People, who are truly loyal, even in Di&s;grace and Afflic|tion, he &s;ays,
<Q><L>For Loyalty is &s;till the &s;ame,</L>
<L>Whether it win, or lo&s;e the Game,</L>
<L>True as the Dial to the Sun,</L>
<L>Altho' it be not &s;hin'd upon.</L></Q>
It is in Similies chiefly that mo&s;t of our Poets, who deal in Wit, or pretend to it, have run Riot. What a Flood of them do we &s;ometimes meet in Dramatic, and other Writers, introduced and pur&s;ued, without Rhyme or Rea&s;on! Every thing talked of is "like this," or "like that." Except a Simile be exceedingly well hit off, it had better be unattempted. Me|tonymy and Metaphor (which are indeed
<PB N="208" REF="211">
but concealed Similies) are, in my Opi|nion, an ea&s;ier and genteeler Conveyance of our Ideas.</P>
<P>There is an admirable Sneer on the&s;e Strings of Similies, which &s;ome Authors are &s;o fond of, in <HI>Swift</HI>'s Introduction to <HI>The Tale of a Tub.</HI> "Wi&s;dom," &s;ays that admirable Writer, <Q>is a Fox, who, after long hunting, will, at la&s;t, co&s;t you the Pains to dig out. It is a Chee&s;e, which, by how much the richer, has the thicker, the homelier and the coar&s;er Coat; and whereof, to a judicious Palate, the Meggots are the be&s;t. It is a Sack-Po&s;&s;et, wherein the deeper you go, you will find it the &s;weeter. Wi&s;dom is a Hen, who&s;e Cackling we mu&s;t value and con&s;ider,
<PB N="209" REF="212">
becau&s;e it is attended with an Egg. But then, la&s;tly, it is a Nut, which, unle&s;s you chu&s;e with Judgment, may co&s;t you a Tooth, and pay you with nothing but a Worm.</Q></P>
<P>Had <HI>Swift</HI> been in earne&s;t in the&s;e Similies, he would, at be&s;t, have appeared whim&s;ically ridiculous; but, in-as-much as he meant them a Satire on Simile-Mongers in general, he is mo&s;t unques|tionably witty; and the whole Air and Turn of the Introduction being facetious, nothing could be better &s;uited to the Character of the Writer.</P>
<P>An Author &s;hould therefore well con|fider, in who&s;e Mouth to put his Simi|lies. That will do well for one Per&s;on,
<PB N="210" REF="213">
which will, by no Means, &s;uit another. I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Compari&s;on of Re|ligion and Politics to Oil and Vinegar, to be as witty as ever was &s;aid on any Occa&s;ion; yet becau&s;e there is &s;omething wild in it, he has properly put it into the Mouth of a Madman, at lea&s;t, a Cha|racter that appears &s;o.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Comedy, <HI>Jeremy</HI> contrives to beguile <HI>Tattle</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Frail</HI> into a Match with each other, when each was on the Hunt for a Fortune el&s;ewhere. <HI>Ben,</HI> a rough Sailor, compares them hereon to a Couple of Privateers, who were looking out for a Prize, and fell foul of each other. This is admirably hu|morous and witty in it&s;elf, but derives double Beauty and Force from the Sailor's &s;peaking it.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="214">I &s;hall conclude this Letter with a Tran&s;cript from the famous Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> where he treats of the Difference between Wit and Judgment.</P>
<P>"If in having our Ideas in the Me|mory, ready at Hand, con&s;i&s;ts Quickne&s;s of Parts, in this of having them uncon|fu&s;ed, and being able nicely to di&s;tin|gui&s;h one Thing from another, where there is but the lea&s;t Difference, con|&s;i&s;ts, in a great Mea&s;ure, the Exactne&s;s of Judgment and Clearne&s;s of Rea&s;on, which is to be ob&s;erved in one Man, above another. And, perhaps, hence may be given &s;ome Rea&s;on of that common Ob|&s;ervation, that Men, who have a great deal of Wit and prompt Memories, have not always the cleare&s;t Judgment or
<PB N="212" REF="215">
deepe&s;t Rea&s;on. For <HI>Wit</HI> lies mo&s;t in the <HI>A&s;&s;emblage of Ideas</HI>; and putting the&s;e together with Quickne&s;s and Variety, wherein can be found any Re&s;emblance and Congruity, thereby to make up plea&s;ant Pictures and agreeable Vi&s;ions in the Fancy. <HI>Judgment,</HI> on the con|trary, lies quite on the other Side, in &s;eparating carefully, one from another, Ideas, wherein can be found the lea&s;t Difference, thereby to avoid being mi&s;led by Similitude, and by Affinity to take one Thing for another.</P>
<P>"This is a Way of proceeding quite contrary to Metaphor and Allu&s;ion; wherein, for the mo&s;t Part, lies that Entertainment and Plea&s;antry of <HI>Wit,</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="216">
which &s;trikes &s;o lively on the Fancy, and therefore &s;o acceptable to all People, becau&s;e its Beauty appears at fir&s;t Sight, and there is required no Labour of Thought to examine what Truth or Rea|&s;on there is in it. The Mind, without looking any further, re&s;ts &s;atisfied with the Agreeablene&s;s of the Picture, and the Gaiety of the Fancy; and it is a kind of Affront to go about to examine it by the &s;evere Rules of Truth and good Rea|&s;on; whereby it appears that it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;omething that is not perfectly con|formable to them."</P>
<P>I would have you, my dear Nancy, con|&s;ider attentively this Di&s;tinction between Wit and Judgment. It is the be&s;t phi|lo&s;ophical
<PB N="214" REF="217">
Account of them that ever I met; though perhaps this Definition does not reach to Wit in its utmo&s;t Extent, at lea&s;t, in the Sen&s;e of the Word, as u&s;ed at pre&s;ent, and thence comes it &s;o hard to be defined or de&s;cribed. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems indeed &s;omewhat &s;en&s;ible of this, for he, you perceive, always &s;peaks with a &s;ort of Exception and Doubt, as, <HI>in a great Mea&s;ure&mdash;perhaps &mdash;for the mo&s;t part,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I believe I &s;hall have &s;omething more for you on this Subject the next Time I write, and then I &s;hall quit it.</P>

of Wit and Humour; I &s;hall only add, that, after all that can be &s;aid of them, they can only be con&s;idered as the Sea|&s;oning of Comedy. The great Standard of all is good Sen&s;e, with Di&s;cernment, Judgment, and a thorough Knowledge of Mankind.</P>
<P>The&s;e mu&s;t appear in the Plot, Con|&s;truction, and Conduct of a Play; in the Sentiments; in the Manners; in the Characters; and in the Propriety of the Diction: our Vices, our Affections, and Pa&s;&s;ions; our Humours, Weakne&s;&s;es, and Follies, as well as their Contraries, ought to be well under&s;tood, coloured, and expre&s;&s;ed.

<P><PB N="217" REF="220">As for the Unities of Action, Time, and Place, which the Antients in&s;i&s;t upon &s;o &s;trongly, e&s;pecially that of Action, the be&s;t that can be &s;aid in their Behalf (in my Opinion) is, that it is better to have them, than be without them; for a Play, if it is not good in it&s;elf, will not become &s;o, for the Unities being ever &s;o religi|ou&s;ly ob&s;erved. We have many Plays extant, where they are all kept to the utmo&s;t Nicety, and yet the Pieces alto|gether are not worth a Peru&s;al.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Dramatic Productions, wherein the Rules are wholly &s;et a&s;ide, which are the Admiration of every Reader of the mo&s;t refined Ta&s;te.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope you have received your Books &s;afe, and found the Letter which was with them in the Box.</P>
<P>I here &s;end you an Ab&s;tract of <HI>Boileau</HI>'s Art of Poetry, as I did of <HI>Vida</HI> there. I have two or three Things to recommend to you in reading the&s;e Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="232">In the fir&s;t Place, you &s;hould con|&s;ider the great Rules, on which the Re&s;t depend, and which are laid down by all, or, at lea&s;t, the major Part of the&s;e Critics. The&s;e great Rules may be thus comprehended;</P>
<P>Good Sen&s;e is the Foundation of all good Writing.</P>
<Q><L>Chu&s;e Subjects fit for your Genius.</L>
<L>Never depart from Nature.</L></Q>
<P>In the next Place, ob&s;erve &s;uch Rules as are in few, or but in one of the&s;e Authors. The&s;e are more likely to e&s;cape your View, and therefore &s;hould be more carefully &s;earched for, and attended to.</P>
<PB N="228" REF="233">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="229" REF="234">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<P><PB N="230" REF="235">You should not run over the&s;e Rules carele&s;&s;ly, and in a cur&s;ory Manner, but deliberately, both with Attention and Application.</P>
<P>Sometimes reflect, at Lei&s;ure, upon one Rule or Head, &s;ometimes upon another, and endeavour to account to your&s;elf for the Rea&s;on of &s;uch Rule. If you cannot clearly &s;atisfy your&s;elf, a&s;k &s;ome Per&s;on, or write to me. It may be no unprofitable, nor unplea&s;ant Diver&s;ion to enter on a Di&s;qui&s;ition of that Kind.</P>
<P>One Caution, by the Bye. Do not load your Head with all the&s;e Rules lumbered together in a confu&s;ed, indi|ge&s;ted Heap, but &s;trive to under&s;tand them clearly and minutely by a pa|tient,
<PB N="231" REF="236">
and lei&s;urely Attention, and you will reap the Fruit of them in due Time.</P>
<P>When you cannot &s;ee quite through the Rea&s;on of any Propo&s;ition, and yet are de&s;irous to account for it by your|&s;elf, rather &s;u&s;pend your Search, than re|main content with a poor imperfect So|lution of the Difficulty; of all Things, never re&s;t &s;atisfied with Ab&s;urdities, which many Per&s;ons are too apt to do, &s;ome from Over&s;ight, &s;ome from, mere Lazi|ne&s;s. Such Errors are attended with a double Di&s;advantage. In the fir&s;t In|&s;tance, no Progre&s;s is made, in our Stu|dies; in the next, the Time is lo&s;t, which might have been employed to &s;ome Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237">The Books, which I have &s;ent you, have, I believe, many Errata, or Mi&s;-Printings in them; a due Ob&s;ervation of the Advice given above, will not only enable you to di&s;cover tho&s;e, but al&s;o to &s;upply the true Meaning of the Author.</P>
<P>Remember that, next to Epic Poetry, Tragedy and Comedy are the great Spe|cies of Writing. Tragedy indeed is it|&s;elf a Species of the <HI>Epic.</HI> I do not re|commend them to you merely that you &s;hould <HI>read Plays,</HI> (according to the Ac|ceptation of di&s;&s;ipated People, who pa&s;s, or rather wa&s;te an idle Hour, over what they neither comprehend nor retain) but as <HI>moral Treati&s;es</HI>; for no dramatic Works, but what have this Tendency,
<PB N="233" REF="238">
an&s;wer the Ends they were de&s;igned for, or are worth your Attention.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h you would improve your|&s;elf in reading; it is a nice Art, and known but to few. You promi&s;e, I think, to excel in it. When engaged in a Poem, you would do well to repeat aloud &s;ometimes. It is of Service to the Breath, if not done to Exce&s;s, and will be of great U&s;e; for many Errors will be di&s;covered by the Ear, that are come at by no other Means. For the Rules of Pronunciation, <HI>Le Faucheur</HI> is the be&s;t In&s;tructor extant among the Mo|derns.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Rules, however well un|der&s;tood, will be of &s;mall U&s;e, without
<PB N="234" REF="239">
knowing the great Models from which the&s;e Rules are drawn; you &s;hould there|fore read the be&s;t Authors in the different Sorts of Poetry.</P>
<P>The Antients lay down the&s;e three Things nece&s;&s;ary to perfect us in any Sci|ence; fir&s;t,
<Q>Art&mdash;that is, Precept or Rule;</Q></P>
<P>Imitation&mdash; that is, an Endeavour to &s;tudy the be&s;t Models, and follow their Manner; and,
<Q>Exercitation&mdash;namely, Practice.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Vida,</HI> as you may ob&s;erve, is the mo&s;t regular of all the&s;e E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts. His fir&s;t Book is on
<Q><PB N="235" REF="240">Invention, or the Provi&s;ion of Matter;</Q>
the next is</P>
<P>The Di&s;po&s;ition, or Well-ordering of that Matter;</P>
<P>the third is</P>
<P>The Beautifying and Adorning of that Matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the three great Points to be ob&s;erved not only in Poetry, but in Ora|tory; and in almo&s;t every Art and Sci|ence, as Painting, Sculpture, Building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 22d, and an|&s;wered it forthwith, but have kept the An&s;wer by me, having been in hourly Expectation of a Recruit of Franks, and they are but now arrived. You have neglected to notice one or two Circum|&s;tances, which I enquired about.

What you thus &s;ay while the Feelings are
<PB N="237" REF="242">
and lively, though contained in &s;ix Lines alone, is worth a whole Vo|lume, that is damped by the Coldne&s;s of Delay.</P>
<P>I never read <HI>Cleveland,</HI> but am told it is an excellent Book, and &s;hews <HI>les Plis et les Replis de Coeur humain</HI> very agreeably and accurately.</P>
<P>I think you &s;hould read <HI>Vida</HI> fir&s;t very carefully; then <HI>Horace</HI>; next to him <HI>Boi|leau</HI>; then <HI>Pope</HI>'s Critici&s;m, <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;common,</HI> progre&s;&s;ively. The Arch|bishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> and <HI>Le-Faucheur,</HI> may come in la&s;t.</P>
<P>Such Particulars as are treated by more than one of them, ought to be compared, after you have gone through the Au|thors.
<PB N="238" REF="243">
For Example, I would have you collect and compare all they have &s;aid upon Epic Poetry together; upon Ode, Satire, Tragedy, and Comedy; and when you have Lei&s;ure, write a &s;ort of Abridg|ment of them, for your own U&s;e.</P>
<P>You &s;hould make your&s;elf a perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of the principal Figures of Speech; &s;uch as Metaphor, Simile, Al|legory, Metonymy, Irony, <HI>&amp;c. Con|greve</HI>'s Letter on Humour is a mo&s;t ad|mirable Piece.

<P><PB N="239" REF="244">I am heartily &s;orry you do not under|&s;tand Latin, on many Accounts; among the re&s;t, that you cannot read <HI>Vida</HI> in the Original. Though the Tran&s;lation mu&s;t be allowed pretty good, yet there is no coming up to the Beauties of the Author's Lines.</P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, <HI>Cleveland</HI> is a Ro|mance; there may, perhaps, be &s;ome Truth in it; but I never read nor heard of a natural Son of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s under that Name, which, had the Story been true, mu&s;t have been known long before now.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 27th in due Cour&s;e. I have written to you on &s;o many Subjects, that I am almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted; and latterly you have not entered into what I have &s;aid &s;ufficiently to give me a Handle for proceeding. It is true, I cannot but admit your Excu&s;e, in Part, to wit, your having &s;o much to do during your Mother's Indi&s;po&s;ition. Your At|tion to her mu&s;t create you full Employ|ment, and you are right not to let any Con&s;ideration interrupt that pious Care.
<PB N="241" REF="246">
I mo&s;t heartily acquit you from the U&s;e of Pen and Ink, till you are at better Lei&s;ure, and will, in the mean Time, endeavour to give you Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>I thought to have &s;aid &s;omething about Figures in Writing, but you now have <HI>Longinus</HI> and <HI>Vida,</HI> who explain them much better than I can.</P>
<P>In a Letter I wrote you lately, I ob|&s;erved there is a great deal of Satire in true Comedy. I have now to add, that there is a great deal of Irony in Satire. This is a very exten&s;ive Figure, and con|verts it&s;elf into many Shapes. Sometimes it is direct, pointed, and &s;harp; &s;ome|times it appears in the Shape of Prai&s;e. It occa&s;ionally counterfeits Love, Pity,
<PB N="242" REF="247">
Fear, in &s;hort, what not? Sometimes it lurks in Metaphor, Allegory, Compari|&s;on, Fable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> has varied it &s;o many Ways, and all &s;o naturally and plea&s;antly, that the Study of his Works, e&s;pecially <HI>The Tale of a Tub,</HI> and the Pieces bound up with it, gives us a bet|ter Idea of true Irony, in all its Branches, than any De&s;cription is capable of af|fording.</P>
<P><HI>The Tale of a Tub</HI> has repre&s;ented the Fopperies and Ab&s;urdities of the Roman Catholic Tenets more glaringly than the grave&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e in the World could have done, and that under a Story taken from common Life. In that Author's other Works, he has expo&s;ed an hundred Fol|lies in &s;o droll a Manner, that they &s;trike
<PB N="243" REF="248">
us in that Way beyond the Power of the mo&s;t &s;olemn E&s;&s;ay or Declamation. How has he expo&s;ed all Kinds and Degrees of Vain-Glory and Affectation, by imi|tating the very Fault he is expo&s;ing! In how contemptible and ju&s;t a Light has he placed the Cu&s;tom of punning, of talking always proverbially, and all idle Di&s;cour&s;e, in his <HI>Polite Conver&s;ation!</HI> In &s;hort, it is needle&s;s to &s;ay more than that the whole Art of Ridicule is to be learned from Swift.</P>
<P>The only Addition I have to make to this Subject, is to quote you one In&s;tance of Irony from the Holy Scriptures, which I think as &s;trong and as ju&s;t as any I ever read. It is in Ridicule of the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal,</HI> who was a fal&s;e God; an Idol,
<PB N="244" REF="249">
and no more. His Prie&s;ts invoked him to perform a Miracle. <HI>Elijah</HI> mocketh them. The Rea&s;ons which he a&s;&s;igns for their God not an&s;wering their Interce&s;|&s;ions, are the &s;evere&s;t Piece of Raillery imaginable.</P>
<P>"Cry aloud," &s;ays he, <Q>for he is a God; either he is talking, or he is pur&s;uing, or he is on a Journey; or, peradventure he &s;leepeth, and mu&s;t be awaked.</Q></P>
<P>All which Charges being &s;o unworthy of a God, the Raillery is conceived, in its full Force, the Moment the Prophet opens his Mouth, and mu&s;t be under|&s;tood by the mo&s;t ordinary Capacity. The whole Chapter is worth your read|ing.
<PB N="245" REF="250">
It is the 18th of the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Kings.</HI></P>
<P>I do not recollect if I ever mentioned to you the 58th Chapter of <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> If I did, you have not noticed it in any of your Letters; if I did not, I now re|commend it to you. It is admirable, as far as re&s;pects the Subject it&s;elf; but the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Chapter, the Repeti|tions, the Empha&s;is and Energy, and the many Figures introduced, make it admirably worth your Notice. The Chap|ter is &s;till more excellent, in-as-much as it is full of &s;trong Figures, yet appears exceedingly &s;imple and plain. This is the great Beauty of Diction, when the Figures are &s;o naturally brought in, that
<PB N="246" REF="251">
we feel their Effect, before we perceive them. They &s;trike un&s;een.</P>
<P><HI>Dryden</HI> &s;ays, <Q>Figures ought to be worked into a Di&s;cour&s;e, as if they were Part of the Ti&s;&s;ue it&s;elf, not em|bo&s;&s;ed upon it.</Q></P>
<P>The Allu&s;ion is excellent, and the Ob|&s;ervation ju&s;t.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours of the third of this Month. You have not yet entered into any of the late Subjects I wrote to you about, but your former Excu&s;e, I pre&s;ume, &s;till exi&s;ts, and it is too &s;trong to be op|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is not material whether you ever read <HI>Polite Conver&s;ation</HI> again or no; the Moral of that Satire is too obvious to re|quire much Attention, it being de&s;igned only to ridicule the in&s;ipid Conver&s;ation
<PB N="248" REF="253">
that pa&s;&s;es too ordinarily among the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable People. And can it well be wondered at, when &s;o little Attention is paid to the Education of Children, whether Male or Female, in higher Life? <HI>To qualify them for Company</HI> (&s;uch is the fa&s;hionable Phra&s;e) is the chief Object of Parents in that Style; that is, to make a Bow, dance a Minuet, and play at Cards. The two fir&s;t I acknowledge to be agreeable, and even nece&s;&s;ary Quali|fications, provided they are accompanied with &s;omething intrin&s;ic. But while &s;o much Care is employed in gracing the Out&s;ide, &s;urely &s;ome little might be u&s;ed in cultivating the Mind. Perhaps <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> is &s;ent to &s;ome public Seminary, and <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> to a Boarding-School; at both which Places, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, the moral Part
<PB N="249" REF="254">
of Education is the la&s;t attended to, if it be at all. They are quickly launched into Life (poor Souls!) and po&s;&s;ibly to the mo&s;t important State of Life, Matri|mony, (as Family-Purpo&s;es and Intere&s;ts lead, or rather, too often mi&s;lead) with|out a &s;ingle Idea to ble&s;&s; them&s;elves with, or even knowing that there is &s;uch a Thing as a <HI>Mind</HI> to in&s;pire and regulate their earthly Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on for calling <HI>The Tale of a Tub</HI> by that Name, is, I think, pretty plain. We call any idle, romantic Story, <HI>A Tale of a Tub,</HI> and if this Story of <HI>Swift</HI>'s were to be taken in a literal Sen&s;e, none ever more ju&s;tly de&s;erved the Name.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the Plea&s;ure of yours of the 10th. You &s;ay there are &s;ome Fi|gures, which you do not, in any wi&s;e, under&s;tand. Add to <HI>Longinus, Vida</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e on this Point, in his third
<PB N="252" REF="259">
Book, and you mu&s;t acquire a due No|tion of the principal Figures or Tropes, both in Poetry and Rhetoric. Metaphor is the chief of all; and even the princi|pal Figures, next to Metaphor, are but Species or Branches of it.</P>
<P>A Metaphor is the U&s;e of a Word in a borrowed Sen&s;e. The principal Pro|perties and U&s;es of it, are,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to expre&s;s Things for which we have not &s;uitable Words or Phra&s;es;</P>
<P>Secondly, to expre&s;s them &s;o &s;trongly, as to convey deep and agreeable Im|pre&s;&s;ions;</P>
<P>Thirdly, to give us the Repre&s;entation and Re&s;emblance of two Things at once.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="260">In &s;hort, it is like a Picture, where the Re&s;emblance to the Thing painted gives us the chief Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Near the Beginning of the third Book of <HI>Vida</HI>'s Art of Poetry, there is this glo|rious De&s;cription of Metaphor:
<Q><L>See how the Poet bani&s;hes with Grace</L>
<L>A native Term to give a Stranger Place!</L>
<L>From diff'rent Images, with ju&s;t Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>He cloaths his Matter in the borrow'd Dre&s;s;</L>
<L>The borrow'd Dre&s;s the Things them&s;elves ad|mire,</L>
<L>And wonder whence they drew the &s;trange At|tire;</L>
<L>Proud of their ravi&s;h'd Spoils, they now di&s;claim</L>
<L>Their former Colour and their genuine Name,</L>
<L>And, in another Garb more beauteous grown,</L>
<L>Prefer the foreign Habit to their own.</L></Q>
<PB N="254" REF="261">
After producing &s;ome beautiful In&s;tan|ces where the Metaphor is thus happily introduced, he proceeds, and illu&s;trates his Sentiment with a Simile, which de&s;erves our highe&s;t Admiration;
<Q><L>Pleased with the borrow'd Charms, the Rea|ders find</L>
<L>A Crowd of diff'rent Images combin'd,</L>
<L>Ri&s;e from a &s;ingle Object to the Mind.</L>
<L>So the pleas'd Trav'ller from a Mountain's Brow</L>
<L>Views the calm Surface of the Seas below,</L>
<L>Tho' wide beneath the floating Ocean lies,</L>
<L>The fir&s;t immediate Object of his Eyes,</L>
<L>He &s;ees the Fore&s;ts tremble from within,</L>
<L>And gliding Meadows paint the Deeps with green;</L>
<L>While to his Eyes the fair Delu&s;ions pa&s;s</L>
<L>In gay Succe&s;&s;ion thro' the watry Gla&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="262">We have no adequate Words in our Language to expre&s;s the Inten&s;ene&s;s of Love, or the Extravagance of any vio|lent Pa&s;&s;ions; for which Rea&s;on it is very common to make u&s;e of Metaphor in our u&s;ual Di&s;cour&s;e; for Example, we <HI>burn</HI> with Love&mdash;we are <HI>inflamed</HI> with Rage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We &s;ay of a Man who is of a kind Di&s;po&s;ition, that he has a <HI>warm</HI> Heart, of one otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed, that he has a <HI>cold,</HI> or a <HI>hard</HI> Heart. We <HI>melt</HI> into Tears; we <HI>&s;ink</HI> with Grief; we <HI>&s;well</HI> with Anger; our Hearts <HI>leap</HI> with <HI>Joy</HI>; we <HI>die</HI> with Fear; and &s;o on. <HI>Virgil,</HI> de&s;cribing <HI>Dido</HI> concealing her Love, &s;ays,
<Q>She <HI>feeds</HI> within her Veins a Flame un&s;een.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="263">In the Holy Scriptures the&s;e metapho|rical Expre&s;&s;ions are frequently met. God <HI>hides</HI> his Face, or <HI>&s;hines</HI> upon us, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Hide</HI> thy Face from my Sins, and <HI>blot</HI> out all my Mi&s;deeds.</P>
<P>Let thy Mercy <HI>&s;hine</HI> upon us!</P>
<P>Lift up the <HI>Light</HI> of thy Countenance upon us.</P></Q>
<P>In other In&s;tances, where we u&s;e Me|taphors to expre&s;s Things with more Strength, and make a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion, for a <HI>dull</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;ay a <HI>cold, life|le&s;s</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e. A Poet, in&s;tead of tell|ing us, the Side-Board <HI>was filled</HI> with Plate, &s;ays,
<Q>The Side-Board <HI>groan'd</HI> with Plate.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="264">Metaphor is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to bring the Thing, from which it is borrowed, before our Eyes, that we may enjoy the Beauty of the Similitude. <HI>Cowley</HI> &s;ays,

<HI>and</HI> Pope,
<Q>A <HI>Tide</HI> of Trojans <HI>flow,</HI> and fill the Place.</Q>
What a beautiful Re&s;emblance is this! It not only pre&s;ents us with the Idea of a great Crowd breaking into an Intrench|ment, but likewi&s;e with that of a raging Sea breaking over its Banks; and to add to both, conveys the perfect Re&s;emblance which each bears to the other.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Metaphor of a Meta|phor is made u&s;e of; for Example, we
<PB N="258" REF="265">
u&s;ually call a <HI>dull</HI> Preacher a <HI>heavy</HI> Preach|er. <HI>Pope</HI> carries this Word <HI>heavy,</HI> which in it&s;elf is a Metaphor, to a Metaphor be|yond it, where he &s;ays, in his new <HI>Dunciad,</HI> &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; leaden Gilbert <HI>preach'd. Heavy</HI> is a metaphorical Expre&s;&s;ion for <HI>dull,</HI> and <HI>leaden</HI> for <HI>heavy.</HI></P>
<P>I will trouble you no further, till I know whether you chu&s;e I &s;hould thus proceed to perfect you in the Knowledge of Figures; if you do, I &s;hall bring you acquainted with the re&s;t of the metapho|rical Family, their Relations, and De|&s;cendants.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot conceive how much you have plea&s;ed me, in &s;ubmitting to &s;o unentertaining a Subject for a Letter, rather than be without In&s;truc|tion. It is but undergoing a little di&s;|agreeable Labour now, to reap the Plea|&s;ure hereafter; for that you certainly will; and without a thorough Knowledge of the Grounds of Rhetorick, the mo&s;t elegant Author or Orator can never take a proper Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of you.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">You a&s;k, in your la&s;t, about Polyp|totes, and Gradations; I &s;hall therefore make them the Subject of this Letter.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Names are <HI>Polyptoton,</HI> and <HI>Climax,</HI> which are both Greek Words. I need not here in&s;ert what <HI>Longinus</HI> &s;ays of them, but refer you to him. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that, be&s;ide the Sub&s;titution of one Number or Ten&s;e for another, (which is the <HI>Polyptoton</HI>) or rather the Licence of &s;o doing, there is often great Beauty in it; e&s;pecially in the Greek and Latin Languages, and chiefly in the former, owing to the Variety of Terminations in their Verbs and Nouns. The French Lan|guage too exceeds ours in this parti|cular,
<PB N="261" REF="268">
though it falls very &s;hort of the other two.</P>
<P>That you may clearly under&s;tand what I mean, take the following Example in French.</P>
<Q>Si vous m'aviez aim&eacute; autant que je vous aime, je vous aimerois mieux que Per&s;onne; mais vouliez vous que je vous aima&s;&s;e, quand vous ne m'aimiez pas?</Q>
<P>Do you not here perceive a beautiful Variety in the Per&s;ons and Ten&s;es? Take the &s;ame in Engli&s;h, and you will di&s;|cover a total Want of it.</P>
<Q>If you had loved me as well as I love you, I would have loved you better than any Per&s;on; but would you
<PB N="262" REF="269">
have had me love you, when you did not at all love me?</Q>
<P>Here you &s;ee nothing but <HI>love</HI> and <HI>loved</HI> all along, and this, I pre&s;ume, explains what I mean.</P>
<P>The Climax is a noble and beau|tiful Figure, when managed with|out Affectation. We a&s;cend from one Step to another, building, as it were, &s;omething on &s;omething laid down be|fore, till we come to the great Point, at which we aim. I will give you two In&s;tances, one on a ludicrous, the other on a &s;olemn Subject. How excellently is the Tumult and Confu&s;ion increa&s;ed in the Poem of the <HI>Alley,</HI> (which I &s;ent you &s;ome Time &s;ince) from a Girl's Whim|pering
<PB N="263" REF="270">
to a Boy's roaring, Dogs barking, Vixens &s;colding, and Swine grunting! Again, How beautiful is the Gradation of Di&s;tre&s;s in <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Pa&s;tora!</HI></P>
<Q><L>No more the Nymphs &s;hall with &s;oft Tales delight,</L>
<L>Her Ears&mdash;no more with Dances plea&s;e her &s;ight;</L>
<L>Nor ever more &s;hall Swain make Song of Mirth,</L>
<L>To ble&s;s the joyous Day, that gave her Birth:</L>
<L>Lo&s;t is that Day, which had from her its Light,</L>
<L>For ever lo&s;t with her, in endle&s;s Night;</L>
<L>In endle&s;s Night, and Arms of Death &s;he lies,</L>
<L>Death in eternal Shades has &s;hut Pa&s;tora's Eyes.</L></Q>
<P>This Figure, you may ob&s;erve by the foregoing Example, is generally accom|panied by Repetition. I will add one more In&s;tance from the great <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> not only to illu&s;trate this Figure, (which indeed it does to an Excellency) but al&s;o
<PB N="264" REF="271">
for the Beauty, Ju&s;tne&s;s, and Utility of the Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<Q>After we have practi&s;ed good Ac|tions a while, they become ea&s;y; and when they are ea&s;y, we begin to take Plea&s;ure in them, and when they plea&s;e us, we do them frequently; and by Frequency of Acts, a Thing grows into a Habit; and a confirmed Habit is a &s;econd Kind of Nature; and &s;o far as any Thing is natural, &s;o far it is nece&s;&s;ary, and we can hardly do otherwi&s;e; nay we do it many Times, when we do not think of it.</Q>
<P>You will ob&s;erve that this great Ma&s;ter of Eloquence avoids repeating the &s;ame Word too literally, but u&s;es a Sort of Variation, to give a greater Beauty to
<PB N="265" REF="272">
his Di&s;cour&s;e, and to avoid &s;eeming af|fected, to which Cen&s;ure an exact Re|petition would probably have expo&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The Omi&s;&s;ion of Copulatives adds much Grace to a Di&s;cour&s;e, on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, particularly in Ha&s;te or Pa&s;&s;ion; for In&s;tance, <HI>Go&mdash;run&mdash;fly&mdash;be quick,</HI> &amp;c. and on others, great Beauty is derived from their being multiplied. The Quo|tation, I have already made from the Arch-Bi&s;hop, wherein the Word <HI>and</HI> is found no le&s;s than &s;ix Times, renders it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek further for an Ex|ample.</P>
<P>I may probably take another Oppor|tunity to enlarge &s;omewhat further on
<PB N="266" REF="273">
the&s;e two oppo&s;ite Figures. I hope to &s;ee you about Chri&s;tmas.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you now under&s;tand a Meta|phor, I &s;hall &s;ay no more on that Head, but con&s;ider the Figures, which
<PB N="267" REF="274">
are near a-kin to it. The&s;e are, Meto|nymy, Synecdoche, Hyperbole, Irony, Simile, Allegory, Fable, and Cata|chre&s;is.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, let me tran&s;cribe a Pa&s;&s;age out of <HI>Blackwell</HI>'s new Intro|duction to the Cla&s;&s;ics, with a little Ad|dition. You may get Acquaintance with this odd Family, through his Means, I dare &s;ay. He is intimate with them.</P>
<P>There is a general Analogy and Re|lation&s;hip between all Tropes; and in all of them we u&s;e a foreign or &s;trange Word, in&s;tead of one that is proper. Hence we &s;ometimes &s;ay one Thing, and mean another quite different; but this is not always the Cafe. The&s;e
<PB N="268" REF="275">
Tropes, like other Relations in Life, are &s;ome nearer, &s;ome farther removed.</P>
<P>When we advance one Thing, and then &s;ay &s;ome other, which has a near Affinity to it, it is a Synecdoche.</P>
<P>When we &s;ay one Thing, and mean another mutually depending, it is a Metonymy.</P>
<P>When we &s;ay one Thing, and mean the very oppo&s;ite, it is Irony.</P>
<P>When we &s;ay one Thing, and mean another like to it, it is a Metaphor.</P>
<P>A Metaphor long continued is an Allegory.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276">An Allegory turned into a Story is called a Fable, and in the Scripture-Language is a Parable.</P>
<P>When a Metaphor is carried into a great Degree of Boldne&s;s it is an Hy|perbole; and when it is far-fetched, or carries &s;ome Impropriety in it, 'tis a Catachre&s;is.</P>
<P>The Metaphor is the Source and Foun|tain of them all; and lies chiefly in Verbs;</P>
<P>Metonymy lies mo&s;t in Nouns, and this is the be&s;t Di&s;tinction I can make be|tween them.</P>
<P>To exemplify the latter, We call a wi&s;e Man a <HI>Cato</HI> or a <HI>Solomon;</HI> a &s;trong Man, a <HI>Hercules;</HI> a hand&s;ome Youth,
<PB N="270" REF="277">

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not heard from you &s;ince <HI>Sunday</HI> la&s;t, &s;o not having any Thing to an|&s;wer, I &s;hall re&s;ume my Di&s;cour&s;e, where I left off.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282">I &s;hall not make any Mention of Irony, as you under&s;tand it &s;ufficiently; nor need I &s;ay much of Hyperbole. It is only an Exaggeration of Things be|yond the Reality, to make a deeper Im|pre&s;&s;ion, or to give us a &s;tronger Idea of what is meant to be conveyed to the Mind. We often run naturally into this, as indeed all Figures have their Source from our Pa&s;&s;ions and Sen&s;ibilities. How common is it to &s;ay, <HI>&s;weeter than Ho|ney, whiter than Snow,</HI> when, in Truth, we mean no more than to &s;ay, <HI>very</HI> &s;weet, and <HI>very</HI> white.</P>
<P>An Hyperbole, like Irony, appears in the Shape of other Figures, &s;ometimes in Similies, as, <HI>like the Snow for White|ne&s;s;</HI> and there are Degrees in the Hy|perbole,
<PB N="276" REF="283">
as in the Simile; for, &s;peaking of any antient Cu&s;tom, we often &s;ay, <HI>as old as the Creation;</HI> and, when we would rai&s;e the Compari&s;on higher, we &s;ay, <HI>older than the Creation.</HI> This Fi|gure is noble, when judiciou&s;ly u&s;ed, but when improperly, it is har&s;h, un|couth, and degenerates into a Catachre|&s;is. There are &s;o many noble Hyper+boles in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and particularly in the Holy Writings, that it is needle&s;s to quote them.</P>
<P>A bold Metaphor becomes an Hyper|bole, a &s;trong extravagant Hyperbole becomes a Catachre&s;is, and even in this there is &s;ome Beauty, when introduced with Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284">A Metaphor and Hyperbole are &s;ome|times &s;oftened by a Compari&s;on; and there is a Manner of expre&s;&s;ing that Com|pari&s;on, whereby not only the two fir&s;t Figures, but even the third it&s;elf, is &s;of|tened; and this is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to be contrived, to avoid Expre&s;&s;ions which otherwi&s;e would be too &s;trong.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;hall be &s;poken of in their due Places, but I &s;hall confine the Re|mainder of this Letter &s;olely to the Hy|perbole.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, an Hyperbole may be direct, as
<Q>The Giant's Head o'ertopp'd the Clouds;</Q>
and the Beauty of the Image pre&s;ented, and Manner of the De&s;cription, frequently
<PB N="278" REF="285">
&s;et off this Figure, and totally conceal the Extravagance of the Fancy. <HI>Virgil</HI> gives us an Example of this in the ninth Book of his <HI>Aeneid,</HI> near the End. He tells us, <HI>Camilla</HI>
<Q><L>Out&s;tripp'd the Winds in Speed upon the Plain,</L>
<L>Flew o'er the Fields, nor hurt the bearded Grain;</L>
<L>She &s;wept the Seas, and as &s;he &s;kimm'd along,</L>
<L>Her flying Feet, unbath'd on Billows hung.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age is very beautiful, as <HI>Dry|den</HI> has rendered it, but it is ten Times more &s;o in the Original. <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;ays,</P>
<Q>She could have &s;lown along the up|permo&s;t Tops of a Field of Corn un|cut, nor have hurt the tender Stalks in her Cour&s;e; or &s;he could have taken her Way through the Middle of the
<PB N="279" REF="286">
Sea, rai&s;ed high with &s;welling Billows, nor &s;o much as dipped the Soles of her &s;wift Feet in them.</Q>
<P>This is a literal Tran&s;lation; but no De&s;cription can reach the Beauties of the Original. Ob&s;erve the plea&s;ing Meta|phors of <HI>flying</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>running fa&s;t</HI>; of <HI>hurting</HI> the Grain in&s;tead of <HI>treading it down</HI>; and the Word which I have ren|dered <HI>dipp'd,</HI> is in the Latin <HI>tingeret,</HI> and conveys le&s;s than <HI>dipping</HI>; it implies no more than <HI>wetting</HI> or <HI>tincturing.</HI></P>
<P>An Hyperbole, in the next Place, may be indirect, as in a Compari&s;on; thus,
<Q><L>It &s;eems as if the <HI>Cyclades</HI> again</L>
<L>Were rooted up, and ju&s;tled in the Main,</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="287">Or floating Mountains floating Mountains meet,</L>
<L>Such was the fir&s;t Encounter of the Fleet.</L>
<BIBL>Aeneid, Book viii. near the End.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>When Hyperboles are very &s;trong, the Subject or the Object at the in&s;tant, the Hurry, Heat, and Pa&s;&s;ion, ought not only to de&s;erve, but even to require them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Letter with one Example from the Holy Scriptures, where the Boldne&s;s of the Figure, in my Opinion, exceeds every thing of that Kind, which can any where be found; and &s;urely the Occa&s;ion not only requires, but commands it. I think it is the Pro|phet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> who, &s;peaking of poor Mor|tals in Compari&s;on with the infinitely great and powerful God, &s;ays,</P>
<Q><PB N="281" REF="288">We are as Nothing, yea le&s;s than Nothing in thy Sight.</Q>
<P>Does not this &s;trike us with a prodi|gious Idea of the infinite Di&s;proportion between <HI>God</HI> and us?</P>
<P>Though the&s;e Figures are ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood yet it requires much Nicety and Attention to di&s;cover how, when, and where they are to be applied, what Degree of Force or Abatement is to be u&s;ed in the Application, and how they &s;hould be dre&s;&s;ed out for the Purpo&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU ob&s;erve very truly, that if the Word <HI>as</HI> were taken out from the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Canticles, which you quoted, they would be &s;till more beau|tiful; and indeed it is not in the Origi|nal. You &s;ee the <HI>as</HI> is in Italick Cha|racters, which is con&s;tantly u&s;ed when Words, that were not in the Original, are added to make the Sen&s;e more intel|ligible, or to &s;uit the warm Expre&s;&s;ions of the Oriental Language to the Coldne&s;s of ours.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="290">The Simile, or Compari&s;on, is a Figure ea&s;ily comprehended, but a &s;kilful Per|&s;on alone knows how and when to u&s;e it. One general and unerring Caution belongs to this, as well as to the other Tropes a-kin to it; namely, that Ba&s;ene&s;s or Meanne&s;s, Impropriety, Loath&s;omene&s;s, Ob&s;cenity, and Prophanene&s;s, are to be avoided. A low and unworthy Compari&s;on &s;hould never interfere with a grand Sub|ject. <HI>Homer</HI> is blamed for this in many In|&s;tances. I &s;hall mention only one; to wit, where he compares <HI>Ajax</HI> to an <HI>A&s;s.</HI> I refer you to what <HI>Vida</HI> had advanced in his Disfavour, and <HI>Pope</HI> in his Defence. There is however great Propriety in the Compari&s;on, that lies in the Action or Behaviour of the one and the other, on the Occa&s;ions that <HI>Homer</HI> mentions,
<PB N="282" REF="291">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="283" REF="292">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="284" REF="293">
though not in the Per&s;on of <HI>Ajax</HI> and the <HI>A&s;s</HI>; but even the Introduction of them any how in a Likene&s;s together, or pre|&s;enting the Idea of one with the other, &s;eems to deba&s;e the Thing compared. <HI>Virgil,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Vida,</HI> would never have done this, and indeed we find him delicate in his Applications, and ever &s;tudiou&s;ly cautious to avoid low and gro&s;s Com|pari&s;ons.</P>
<P>There is a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful Simile in one of <HI>Pope</HI>'s Epi&s;tles, about <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI> Hogs; nothing but the Loath&s;omene&s;s of the Vice he is decrying, and his De|&s;ign of making it dete&s;table, can ex|cu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Prophane Compari&s;ons &s;hock People of Virtue, as much as People of Breed|ing.
<PB N="285" REF="294">
I will give you one In&s;tance, which I have many Times heard with Pain. When any one has talked or acted in an unintelligible or unaccountable Manner, I have heard a Pretender at Wit exclaim, <Q>Oh! that's like the Peace of <HI>God,</HI> it pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding;</Q> alluding prophanely to the Benediction at the End of the Communion-Service. Words and Phra&s;es, which have been &s;anctified and con&s;ecrated in an e&s;pecial Manner to re|ligious Purpo&s;es, ought not idly to be played with and &s;coffed at. Some Per|&s;ons were &s;o warm in the Revolution-Intere&s;t, that they called <HI>King William</HI> the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the Nation. It is true there was no actual Harm in this, but another Term might have been found, and with a better Grace, while we have &s;o con&s;tant
<PB N="286" REF="295">
and material an Idea devoted to the Word <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pope</HI> has been blamed by &s;ome Per&s;ons for calling <HI>Agamemnon, King of Kings</HI>; that Appellation having been &s;o &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated to <HI>God,</HI> in the <HI>Revelations,</HI> and el&s;ewhere in the Holy Writings.</P>
<P>We are not to expect a Compari&s;on &s;hould hit in every Particular; it is enough if the Thing, to which we allude, agree with the Thing compared in the prin|cipal Point or Points, that we intend to illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>A &s;hort Compari&s;on is ea&s;ily turned into a Metaphor; but where it runs into a Length of Circum&s;tances, it is impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="287" REF="296">
to do it. For Example, when <HI>Vir|gil,</HI> in the twelfth Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> compares <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Turnus,</HI> in the Heat of the Battle, to two Torrents ru&s;hing down a Precipice, and laying every thing wa&s;te before them; and again, near the End of the Book, where he likens the &s;ame Heroes, <HI>Turnus</HI> flying, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> pur&s;uing, to a Deer and a Hound, the Particulars are &s;o many, and the Illu&s;|tration &s;o exten&s;ively beautiful, that it would not be comprized within the Compa&s;s of a Metaphor.</P>
<P>Where the Metaphor would be too hard or ob&s;cure, then a Simile is nece&s;|&s;ary; for In&s;tance, it would have been uncouth in <HI>Homer</HI> to have called <HI>Hector a &s;udden Night,</HI> or <HI>a &s;nowy Mountain</HI>; in
<PB N="288" REF="297">
the one Place therefore he &s;ays, <Q>he came on the Greeks <HI>like</HI> &s;udden Night,</Q> which creates a &s;trong Idea of Terror; and in the other, <HI>"like</HI> a &s;nowy Mountain," from his Figure being &s;o con&s;picuous, and his &s;hining Arms.</P>
<P>Let me here digre&s;s a Moment, and rai&s;e your Admiration, perhaps, your In|dignation. Some piddling Criticks, who, for&s;ooth, would have a Compari&s;on hit in every Particular, and look in the wrong Place for the Simile, have found Fault with the la&s;t I mentioned. " What," &s;ay they, <Q>does a &s;nowy Mountain move?</Q> as if the E&s;&s;ence of the Simile con&s;i&s;ted in the Motion. No, &s;urely, the Beauty is only in the awful <HI>Appear|ance</HI> of a Mountain covered with Snow,
<PB N="289" REF="298">
which <HI>Hector</HI> re&s;embled when he moved along, towering in his Stature, and &s;hining in his Arms.</P>
<P>As Compari&s;ons need not be exact in every Particular, &s;o &s;ometimes a Poet of a &s;ublime Genius will run his De&s;crip|tion beyond the Compari&s;on, when any &s;ingular Quality or Circum&s;tance &s;trikes upon his Fancy, though it has nothing to do with the Compari&s;on it&s;elf, or the Matter that introduced it. Whether this is &s;trictly allowable by the nice Rules of Critici&s;m, I &s;hall not determine; but &s;urely it is very natural, and, in my Opinion, highly beautiful. The French call the&s;e Compari&s;ons <HI>&agrave; longue Queue.</HI> Many of them are to be found in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Milton.</HI> They are not &s;o frequent in
<PB N="290" REF="299">
<HI>Virgil,</HI> though I &s;hall in&s;tance you one from him, becau&s;e it is but &s;hort, and has been the Subject of much Alterca|tion among the learned. It is in the fir&s;t Book of the Aeneid, and thus tran&s;lated by <HI>Dryden,</HI>

but there is no coming up to <HI>Virgil</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now what I mean particularly to ob|&s;erve, is, the Circum&s;tance of <HI>Latona</HI>'s Joy. This has nothing to do with the Compari&s;on it&s;elf, and therefore &s;ome Critics wi&s;h it had been omitted. I am not one of their Number. I think it adds great Beauty to the Pa&s;&s;age. Is any thing more lovely than &s;uch a Reflection as this? Would it not immediately and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;trike a Poet of a noble Fancy? And is it not highly natural that a Parent &s;hould be in Tran&s;port at the Sight of a Child in &s;uch an <HI>Attitude,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf? "The chief among ten thou&s;and," as the Scrip|ture
<PB N="293" REF="302">
terms it, and according to <HI>Otway,</HI> (if I do not err)
<Q>Among ten thou&s;and eminently known?</Q>
Does not the Poet give us al&s;o a lovely In&s;tance of Decorum, in de&s;cribing the Parent mode&s;tly attempting to conceal her Tran&s;ports of Joy, too delicate in her Feelings to exult openly? How ju|dicious a Writer was <HI>Virgil!</HI></P>
<P>The Fancy and Judgment of a Poet is not more con&s;picuous in any Particu|lar, than in a noble and apt Simile ele|gantly expre&s;&s;ed; for which Rea&s;on, I could wi&s;h you, my dear, to remark &s;uch carefully in all your reading, but more e&s;pecially in the&s;e three great Poets, <HI>Ho|mer, Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="303">I may po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome Time or other, &s;hew you the va&s;t Excellency of this Compari&s;on (ju&s;t quoted) in the Original, and how far it exceeds the Tran&s;lation.

<P>I Shall now explain Allegory and Fa|ble, and then give you Time to breathe awhile, for I fear I grow tire|&s;ome to you; but it is your Good which I intend by my long Letters; and Pre|cepts, delivered in this Mode of Di&s;|cour&s;e between Friends, often make a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion, than what are to be found in Books, although they may be better explained there.

<P>Allegory is &s;aid to be a String of Me|taphors; but I think this De&s;cription de|fective; for unle&s;s that Series of Meta|phors depends on &s;ome one particular Point, it is either a faulty Allegory, or, rather, no Allegory at all.

<P><PB N="298" REF="307">This has been much cen&s;ured as a faulty Allegory, becau&s;e the Writer flies from one Allu&s;ion to another, from <HI>Slings</HI> to <HI>taking up of Arms</HI>&mdash;again&s;t what?&mdash; <HI>a Sea</HI>&mdash;and then <HI>oppo&s;ing a Sea,</HI> &amp;c. Now if <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> meant this for an Allegory, it is doubtle&s;s very faulty; but I verily believe that was not his Meaning. I am of Opinion that he only took the fir&s;t &s;trong Metaphor which came into his Head, to expre&s;s him&s;elf forcibly and pathetically, and then another, and ano|ther, as the Subject ro&s;e upon them, but had no idea of making them connected with, or dependent on each other. I will not venture to affirm I am right, but I am certain that one of the mo&s;t judicious and correct Authors that ever wrote Comedy, does the &s;elf-&s;ame Thing;

<P>This, you &s;ee, is liable to the very &s;ame Exception with the former, the Metaphor not being continued in the &s;ame Kind; but I believe neither Author had even the mo&s;t di&s;tant Notion of an Al|legory.</P>

<P>Here al&s;o you find the Allegory finely pur&s;ued throughout; yet not &s;o &s;cru|pulou&s;ly, as not to depart a little from it in the fourth Line,

<P>From Allegory there is an ea&s;y Tran|&s;ition to little proverbial Sayings, and to Fables, which are but Allegories worked up into a Story. Our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Parables are of this Kind, exactly in Character, and obvious to every Under&s;tanding.
<PB N="302" REF="311">
<HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> it is true, takes the Liberty to make Birds and Bea&s;ts &s;peak, but, bar|ring that, he always adheres to Charac|ter. There ought to be a Moral couched in all Fables, or to no Purpo&s;e are they &s;poke or written.</P>
<P>Compari&s;ons, proverbial Speeches, Pa|rables and Fables, may be ea&s;ily convert|ed, the one into the other.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Moral is expre&s;&s;ed, &s;ometimes under&s;tood. By &s;ome Writers it is &s;et in Front, as by <HI>Fontaine</HI>; by &s;ome, at the End, as by <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>; and oc|ca&s;ionally it is placed in the Middle of the Work.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e moral Sentences which we find &s;o frequently inter&s;persed in <HI>Homer, Vir|gil,
<PB N="303" REF="312">
Milton,</HI> &amp;c. before, in the Middle, or at the Clo&s;e of &s;ome intere&s;ting Nar|ration, are entirely in the Nature of Mo|rals to a Fable.</P>
<P>I &s;hall throw a little Illu&s;tration on the&s;e Points, particularly relative to pro|verbial Sentences and Phra&s;es, and then relea&s;e my dear Scholar.</P>
<P>We have a Proverb in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<Q>Cocks are free of Hor&s;e-Corn;</Q>
meaning to imply that People are liberal or profu&s;e of what belongs to another.</P>
<P>Again, we have,

<PB N="304" REF="313">
&s;ignifying, if you accu&s;tom your Servants, or other Folks, to make frequent U&s;e of what is yours, they will think, at la&s;t, that they have acquired a Right to it.</P>
<P>How ea&s;ily now may the&s;e be changed into a Compari&s;on! for In&s;tance, <Q>As a Cat that has been allowed,</Q> &amp;c.&mdash;<Q>As a Cock, that &s;its in a Manger,</Q> &amp;c. &mdash;or into a Fable, as, <Q>A Widow had a favourite Cat, whom &s;he indulged</Q> and &s;o on. The&s;e &s;imple Examples clearly &s;hew how clo&s;ely the Figures are allied.</P>
<P>A Fable or Story may be either true or fal&s;e, it matters not which, &s;o that a Moral accompanies it, and flows natu|rally from it.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="314">Here follows a Quotation from Spen|&s;er, where a Fable, Compari&s;on, and Moral, are finely wrought up together.</P>
<Q><L>As when a weary Traveller, that &s;trays</L>
<L>By muddy Shore of broad &s;ev'n-mouthed Nile,</L>
<L>Unweeting of the per'lous wand'ring Ways,</L>
<L>Doth meet a cruel, crafty Crocodile,</L>
<L>Which, in fal&s;e Grief hiding his harmful Guile,</L>
<L>Doth weep full &s;ore, and &s;heddeth tender Tears,</L>
<L>The fooli&s;h Man, that pities, all this while,</L>
<L>His mournful Plight, is &s;wallow'd anawares,</L>
<L>Forgetful of his own, who minds another's Cares.</L></Q>
<P>In the foregoing Part of this Letter, I ob&s;erved that <HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> though he makes his feigned Per&s;ons, that is, his Birds and Bea&s;ts, conver&s;e and rea&s;on, yet he always pre&s;erves Character. One Mi|nute's Patience more, while I illu&s;trate this. His fir&s;t Fable affords me the Means.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="315"><Q>A Dog, with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth, looking into a Pool of Water, imagines he there &s;ees another Dog, with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth; he &s;natches at that, and thereby lo&s;es his own.</Q></P>
<P>This is all very natural to a Dog, and a plain Moral is to be deduced; namely; that we give up Certainty for Hope, when we greedily gra&s;p at having too much.</P>
<P>The Rever&s;e of this Rule of pre&s;erving Character is <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Fable of the <HI>Hind</HI> and <HI>Panther.</HI> He has wholly departed from it. His Hind and Panther &s;et forth at fir&s;t in Kind, I allow; but in the Sequel, he makes them rea&s;on and
<PB N="307" REF="316">
di&s;pute about Fathers and Councils, the Church, and the <HI>Pope,</HI> School-Divinity, Infallibility, and the Lord knows what. He then introduces a whole Flock of Birds, and characterizes them all as Men. The <HI>Buzzard</HI> was the famous Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> who was Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sali&s;bury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dryden</HI> has been ju&s;tly cen&s;ured for this Incon&s;i&s;tency; for &s;ay the Critics, in Support of their Accu&s;ation, <Q>Sup|po&s;e a Colonel of Hor&s;e had thrown up his Regiment in fooli&s;h Hope of getting a higher Command, and was di&s;appointed,</Q> Ae&s;op's Fable might aptly be applied to him; but it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, <Q>The Dog &s;eeing another Dog in the Water, with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth, dropped
<PB N="308" REF="317">
the Piece in his own Mouth, and &s;natched at the other, and &s;o lo&s;t his <HI>Regiment of Hor&s;e.</HI></Q> This were to confound the Allu&s;ion with the Story alluded to, the Moral with the Fable.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion whether I need trouble you with the Catachre&s;is or no; however I will be brief.</P>
<P>Catachre&s;is is the Abu&s;e or over-&s;train|ing a Figure. One Species of it is, when, through the Want of proper, we use im|proper Terms; for Example, a <HI>Gla&s;s-Inkhorn,</HI> or a <HI>Silver Smoothing-Iron.</HI> Par|ricide is properly the Murderer of one's Father, but in Default of better Powers of Expre&s;&s;ion, we apply the Name to one who has murdered, either his Mo|ther,

Brother or Si&s;ter. <HI>Longinus</HI> cen|&s;ures &s;ome Writer for calling a Hillock a <HI>Wart. Quintilian</HI> has given many In&s;tances of this, and even from <HI>Virgil</HI>; &s;ome of them very beautiful; but when the Image is beautiful, I think it can not with Propriety be called a Catachre&s;is. <HI>Blackwell</HI> pronounces the following Pa&s;|&s;age from <HI>Milton</HI> to be &s;uch;
<Q><L>Down thither prone in Flight</L>
<L>He &s;peeds, and thro' the va&s;t aetherial Sky</L>
<L>Sails between Worlds and Worlds.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is when he de&s;cribes the De|&s;cent from Heaven of the Arch-Angel, <HI>Raphael.</HI> I am not of his Opinion; the Idea is &s;upremely &s;ublime, but not over&s;trained.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 19, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONE Thing I advanced was, that in <HI>Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. the Moral is often placed in the Middle of the Story. Such In&s;ertions are called Sentences, or &s;hort moral Reflections.</P>
<P>When <HI>Turnus</HI> kills <HI>Pallas,</HI> in the tenth Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and is exulting in the Victory he has obtained, the Poet, in the very Heart of his Story, breaks forth into this Reflection.</P>
<Q><L>Dark to Futurity, and blind to Fate,</L>
<L>Are mortal Minds, indocile to ob&s;erve</L>
<L>Due Mea&s;ure, when elated with Succe&s;s."</L>
<BIBL>Dr. Trapp.</BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="312" REF="321">In the Beginning of the twelfth Book of the <HI>Iliad, Homer</HI> tells us in one Line, "The Grecian Wall was built without Sacrifices to the Gods;" in the next Line, he &s;ays, "Without the good Will of the Gods;" and immediately thereon adds,
<Q><L>Without the Gods how &s;hort a Period &s;tands,</L>
<L>The proude&s;t Monument of mortal Hands!</L></Q>
The Meaning here is exactly the &s;ame with that In P&s;alm cxxvii. I.</P>
<Q>Except the Lord build the Hou&s;e, they but labour in vain who build it.</Q>
<P>Where, by the Way, you may remark the &s;trong and figurative Turn of the Ea&s;tern Language; we &s;hould, probably, phra&s;e it, "Without <HI>God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance,"</HI> but they more emphatically call it <HI>"God's own Doing."</HI></P>
<P>There
<PB N="313" REF="322">is a &s;hort, but noble, Reflection in the Story of <HI>Cali&s;to</HI> in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Metamorpho&s;es. <HI>Cali&s;to,</HI> before &s;he was di&s;honoured by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> was always at the Side of <HI>Diana,</HI> but, after that di&s;graceful Event, &s;he de|clined the Freedom, and lagged behind her; whereon the Poet exclaims,
<Q><L>How in the Look does con&s;cious Guilt appear?</L>
<L>Slowly &s;he mov'd, and loiter'd in the Rear,</L>
<L>Nor lightly tripp'd, nor by the Godde&s;s ran,</L>
<L>As once &s;he us'd, the Foremo&s;t of the Train;</L>
<L>Her Looks were flu&s;h'd, &amp;c.</L>
<BIBL>Addi&s;on.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Having illu&s;trated this Point, as far I think nece&s;&s;ary, I am tempted, from the foregoing Quotation, to make a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion. A mo&s;t excellent Le&s;&s;on, my dear Nanoy, may fairly be deduced from the Story of <HI>Cali&s;to</HI>; no doubt, the Author meant it.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="323">Thus then it &s;tands. An artful, prac|ticed, general Lover (&s;uch was <HI>Jove</HI>'s Character) can a&s;&s;ume any, and every Appearance to effect his Purpo&s;e; the more contradictory to what he really is, the better his Fraud is concealed. <HI>Jove</HI> a&s;&s;umes the Appearance even of <HI>Diana,</HI> by which the Poet means, that the Lover may wear the Ma&s;k of the mo&s;t delicate Cha&s;tity, till he finds an Opportunity to throw it off, and re&s;ume the <HI>Jove.</HI> How this is to be guarded again&s;t, is al&s;o nicely in&s;inuated by <HI>Ovid.</HI> He &s;eems to &s;ay, <Q>Never &s;uffer your&s;elf to li&s;ten to the &s;pecious Di&s;cour&s;es of that Lover, who wi&s;hes to &s;eparate you from the Virgin Throng, in who&s;e Company you are &s;afe, or from your Protectre&s;s, the real <HI>Diana,</HI> and lead you to private
<PB N="315" REF="324">
Walks and &s;ecret Groves,</Q> as the Author phra&s;es it. The poor <HI>Cali&s;to,</HI> you &s;ee, meant no Ill, but &s;he had thrown her&s;elf <HI>out of Protection.</HI> The more plau&s;ible and &s;pe|cious a Lover appears, the more dan|gerous he really is. Every virtuous Wo|man &s;hudders at a profe&s;&s;ed Libertine; but you remember the Moral to the <HI>Cha|peron rouge,</HI> my dear Nancy, which you tran&s;lated at &s;even Years old,
<Q><L>Helas! qui ne &s;&ccedil;ait que ces Loups doucere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x</L>
<L>De tous les Loups &s;ont les plus dangereux!</L></Q>
and there is really but one Te&s;t to be made of this <HI>human Wolf</HI>; namely, will he &s;uffer his Addre&s;s to be made known to your tried and natural Friends, your Parents, or Guardians? If he declines this, and wi&s;hes it to be kept &s;e|cret,
<PB N="316" REF="325">
then take Heed, <Q>The Wolf, the Wolf's at Hand.</Q></P>
<P>I now proceed to give you, as far as I am able, the Difference between Tropes and Figures.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, you are to know that both are occa&s;ionally called Figures; and <HI>Quintilian</HI> him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, that the Di&s;tinction is very often hard to be a&s;cer|tained; for &s;ome figurative Expre&s;&s;ions may belong either to Synecdoche, which is a Trope, or Polyptote, Which is a Figure. The be&s;t Di&s;tinction then, that I can draw, is this; Trope is a Turn|ing of the proper Sen&s;e of the Word into a borrowed, or improper Sen&s;e. For Example, <HI>I &s;well with Rage, or Pride.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="326">A <HI>Figure</HI> is an extraordinary Expre&s;|&s;ion; it con&s;i&s;ts in the Point, Arrange|ment, Repetition, or Di&s;po&s;ition of Words in a Manner not common.</P>
<P><HI>Trope</HI> comes from a Greek Word, which &s;ignifies a Turning or Changing, and is only applied where the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> is turned. When the Turn is in the <HI>Words,</HI> we call it <HI>Figure</HI>; though the Word <HI>Trope</HI> would be as proper to imply <HI>Figure,</HI> but Cu&s;tom has made it thus; and that is &s;ufficient for our Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Tropes are principally what we have been di&s;cour&s;ing about, and are chiefly Metaphor, Metonymy, Synec|doche, Irony, Hyperbole, Allegory, Compari&s;on, Sentences or &s;hort Morals,
<PB N="318" REF="327">
Fable or Parable, and Catachre&s;is. The&s;e are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;tudied.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Returned la&s;t Night. I had yours of the 12th, 16th, and 19th very &s;afe, and am heartily glad your Mother is

better. I make no Doubt but you di&s;|charged your Duty to her.</P>
<P>I here enclo&s;e a Letter for Mr. <HI>Mil|lan,</HI> who&s;e Shop is near <HI>Old Man's Cof|fee-Hou&s;e,</HI> between <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI> and <HI>White-Hall.</HI> It is an Order to deliver you <HI>Spen&s;er,</HI> and any Author be&s;ide, that you may fancy, when you are there.</P>
<P>I expect to hear from you more fre|quently now, as you will have more Time. There are &s;everal Portions both of the Holy Scriptures, and the Apo|crypha, that I recommended long ago to your Peru&s;al, and which you promi&s;ed to read attentively. Have you done &s;o? You do not mention them. They are of more intrin&s;ic Value, towards your
<PB N="328" REF="337">
pre&s;ent Welfare and future Happine&s;s, than all the other Books, I know, put together, and will be ever deemed &s;o by Per&s;ons of &s;olid Sen&s;e. I will men|tion one or two Pa&s;&s;ages, which I have reflected on a thou&s;and Times; and it will be well for you to carry them much in your Mind, for they will never fail. <HI>God</HI> &s;ays,</P>
<Q>Him that honoureth me will I ho|nour, and whoever de&s;pi&s;eth me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</Q>
<P>The next Pa&s;&s;age is in the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> Chap. xvi. Ver&s;e 7.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since my la&s;t, I have read the chief of <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Plays; &s;ome of them are indeed but <HI>petites Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>This Week I de&s;ign to examine <HI>Le Medecin malgr&eacute; lui, Amphitryon, Le Mi|&s;antrope,</HI> and <HI>L'Avare.</HI> I propo&s;e to
<PB N="330" REF="339">
read the two la&s;t with great Care, as they are reputed two of his fine&s;t Plays. <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes</HI> is my great Favourite, and, for a petite Piece, <HI>Les precieu&s;e Ri|dicules.</HI> I like the <HI>Femmes S&ccedil;avantes</HI> migh|tily.</P>
<P><HI>Le Malade Imaginaire,</HI> was <HI>Moliere</HI>'s la&s;t Play, and thought by &s;ome Critics to be the be&s;t he ever wrote. I think, at lea&s;t, there is more In&s;truction and Diver&s;ion mingled together in this, than in many of his Pieces. The <HI>Mi&s;antrope,</HI> perhaps, is the mo&s;t ma&s;terly, but it does not create &s;o much Mirth as &s;ome others, and the Characters and Sentiments re|quire great Attention.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="340">I will now &s;et down the Plays which I have read, and which you are not ac|quainted with. <HI>George Dandin, Tartuffe, Mon&s;ieur Pourceaugnac, Le Bourgeois Gen|tilhomme, Les Fourberies de Scapin, Les Femmes S&ccedil;avanies, Le Malade Imaginaire.</HI> You will find the fir&s;t, third, fourth, and fifth, very entertaining, <HI>fort enjou&eacute;es,</HI> as the French &s;ay. The &s;econd, &s;ixth, and &s;eventh, are very in&s;tructing, and will likewi&s;e give you great Plea&s;ure, e&s;pe|cially the two la&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Moliere</HI>'s four great Plays, in my Opi|nion, are <HI>Le Mi&s;antrope, L'Avare, Le Malade Imaginaire,</HI> and <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes.</HI> I think the Character of <HI>Agnes,</HI> in <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes,</HI> and that of <HI>Alce&s;te,</HI> in the <HI>Mi&s;antrope,</HI> the two fine&s;t he ever drew.
<PB N="332" REF="341">
The next in Degree is <HI>Arnolphe</HI> in <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes.</HI> The two Brothers, <HI>Ari&s;te</HI> and <HI>Sganarelle,</HI> in <HI>L'Ecole des Maris, Madame Pernelle</HI> in <HI>Tartuffe,</HI> the two <HI>precieu&s;es Ridicules, So&s;ie</HI> in <HI>Amphitryon, Harpagon</HI> and the <HI>Commi&s;&s;aire</HI> in <HI>L'Avare,</HI> are all finely drawn; not but there are many others well executed, but the&s;e &s;trike me mo&s;t, and mu&s;t have co&s;t him great Pains to paint, as their Excellence con|&s;i&s;ts not only in their being truly ju&s;t and natural, but they are withal nicely and highly fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Some of his Pieces are of the Opera-Kind, e&s;pecially <HI>L'I&s;le D'Amour,</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;&s;e d'Elide, P&s;yche,</HI> and <HI>Melicerte,</HI> which la&s;t is a pa&s;toral heroic Comedy.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="342">The&s;e which you have read are the be&s;t, excepting only <HI>Le Malade Imaginaire.</HI> The <HI>Bourgeois Gentilhomme,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Pourceaugnac,</HI> will divert you much; <HI>George Dandin, Les Fourberies de Scapin,</HI> and <HI>La Conte&s;&s;e D'E&s;carbagnas,</HI> will like|wi&s;e give you &s;ome Plea&s;ure. All which I have now gone through I did read for|merly, except the <HI>Conte&s;&s;e D'E&s;carbagnas.</HI> She is a &s;illy, vain, affected Woman of Quality, who had been once in her Life at <HI>Paris,</HI> for about two Months, which runs mightily in her Head. She has &s;ome Re&s;emblance of Lady <HI>Plyant,</HI> but, in my Opinion, is not &s;o well drawn.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the Plea&s;ure of yours of the 5th of this Month. Our Opinions of <HI>Mo|liere,</HI> I &s;ee, are pretty nearly alike, and I am not di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>There is a Poem of <HI>Moliere</HI> in Com|mendation of <HI>Mignard</HI>'s Painting in a
<PB N="335" REF="344">
Church at <HI>Paris.</HI> It is called <HI>La Gloire du Dome du Val de Grace,</HI> but this I have not yet read.</P>
<P>This Week I have gone through <HI>L'Etourdi, Don Juan, Le Depit amoureux, Les Amans Magnifiques,</HI> and <HI>L'Ombre de Moliere. L'Etourdi</HI> is the fir&s;t Play he wrote. The chief Entertainment of this Piece con&s;i&s;ts in the Addre&s;s and Contri|vance of the Servant being perpetually overturned by the Blunders of his Ma&s;ter. Though the latter promi&s;es again and again not to meddle in the Schemes of the former, yet his Vanity and Self-Suf|ficiency &s;till prompt him to interfere anew, and ruin the whole. We &s;ee, in the Ser|vant, that a Pride to have his Plots &s;uc|ceed induces him to be con&s;tant to his
<PB N="336" REF="345">
Ma&s;ter, rather than his Love and Fidelity; and, at the la&s;t, the Scheme &s;ucceeds more by good Luck, than any other Cir|cum&s;tance. All this is very judiciou&s;ly hit off by the Author; but to make the Servant talk to his Ma&s;ter in the mo&s;t &s;arca&s;tical Strain, and ever and anon call him Bea&s;t and Fool, is beyond all Bounds of Propriety and Decorum.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> is dreadfully de&s;troyed by Thunder and Lightning, and the Earth &s;wallows him, which Fate is, in a Man|ner, foretold to him by an Apparition. Nothing can end more tragically, yet <HI>Moliere</HI> calls it a Comedy. <HI>Juan</HI>'s Cha|racter is horridly fine, and con&s;i&s;tent throughout; <HI>bien &s;outen&ucirc;,</HI> as the French expre&s;s it. He is brave, fierce, exce&s;|&s;ively
<PB N="337" REF="346">
pa&s;&s;ionate, not devoid of Sen&s;e or Wit, but a mo&s;t abandoned Wretch. The Moral of the Play is good, and there are &s;ome very diverting Scenes; particularly one with a Merchant, who comes to dun <HI>Juan</HI> for Money; whence Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> I &s;urmi&s;e, took the Hint of the Scene, to the &s;ame Effect, between <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Trapland.</HI></P>
<P>The Sentiments and Dialogue of the <HI>Depit amoureux</HI> are good; the Character of Women given by <HI>Gros-ren&egrave;</HI> to his Ma&s;ter, is very entertaining; and though there is no Exce&s;s of Wit or Humour in the Piece, yet it is the be&s;t-conducted Plot in all <HI>Moliere.</HI> The Manner whereby he winds all his Per&s;onages out of their Difficulties engages the Attention won|derfully,
<PB N="338" REF="347">
and conveys a Plea&s;ure rather from the Re&s;ult of the whole, than from Particulars. I would therefore, my Dear, have you read it with great At|tention.</P>
<P>There is no great Matter in the <HI>Amans Magnifiques,</HI> yet it is entertaining; but the Interlude after the &s;econd Act, a &s;ort of little pa&s;toral Drama, is, I think, one of the fine&s;t Things I ever &s;aw, in that Way. It is &s;imple, natural, and perfectly &s;uited to the pa&s;toral Character. The Song of <HI>Tircis,</HI> which is called the fir&s;t Scene, and that of <HI>Cali&s;te,</HI> which is the third, are tender and natural beyond Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and the re&s;t entirely accord with them.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="348"><HI>Le Malade Imaginaire</HI> is admirably fine; but herein <HI>Moliere</HI> has been much blamed for attacking Phy&s;ic as an Art. In his other Plays, &s;ay they, he attacks Quackery, and the Abu&s;e of that Art; but here he attacks Phy&s;ic it&s;elf, and re|pre&s;ents the very Science as an Impo&s;i|tion on Mankind. I am afraid there is &s;omething of this too true, in the Conver&s;ation between the Mi&s;er and his Brother.</P>
<P><HI>L'Ombre du Moliere</HI> is a <HI>petite Piece.</HI> It was written by one <HI>Brecourt,</HI> who was an Actor under <HI>Moliere.</HI> The Plan is this&mdash;The Gho&s;ts of many of tho&s;e Per|&s;onages, whom <HI>Moliere</HI> had turned into Ridicule, come to <HI>Pluto,</HI> in the other World, to complain of him. The whole
<PB N="340" REF="349">
is pretty well executed, in particular the Character of the <HI>Doctor</HI>; but I cannot, by any Means, perceive a Rea&s;on for introducing the Gho&s;t of <HI>Nicolle</HI> in the <HI>Bourgeois Gentilhomme.</HI></P>

<P>I Have now read <HI>Moliere's Plai&s;irs de L'I&s;le Enchant&eacute;e,</HI> with the <HI>Prince&s;&s;e d'Elide,</HI> which is a Part of it. It co&s;ts a World of Pains to read it through, and it is of that Species, which gives more
<PB N="341" REF="350">
Plea&s;ure by being con&s;idered all together, than in its particular Parts. There is &s;omething remarkably fine and natural in the Character and Behaviour of the <HI>Prince d'Hague,</HI> and the <HI>Prince&s;&s;e d'Elide,</HI> and proves the Author well under&s;tood Hu|mankind. But I &s;hall not enter into it minutely, that I may not fore&s;tall your Plea&s;ure. It will co&s;t you &s;ome Pains in reading, but is worth them all, only to con&s;ider tho&s;e two Characters tho|roughly. They are not only perfectly well drawn, but withal very in&s;tructive. I think the Character of <HI>Moron</HI> rather unnatural. It is both in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, and there is &s;omething in each, not to be found in the other, which de|&s;erves well to be read; it will therefore co&s;t you a double Application. If you
<PB N="342" REF="351">
will mark down Phra&s;es and Words, which are new to you, you will find the Advantage of it. When you have ex|amined the&s;e very carefully, we will di&s;|cour&s;e on the particular Beauties.</P>
<P>Since I left <HI>Moliere,</HI> I have applied my&s;elf again to <HI>Horace.</HI> I have gone through all his Satires, Epi&s;tles, Art of Poetry, the two fir&s;t Books of his Odes, and half of the third. It is much to be lamented, that this inimitable Author is not well tran&s;lated. I do not know where there are more excellent In&s;tructions for the Conduct of human Life. At pre&s;ent, I &s;hall only recommend to your Peru&s;al the &s;econd and eighteenth Epi&s;tles in the fir&s;t Book, and the tenth Satire, in the &s;econd Book. Howbeit in any Tran&s;|lation,
<PB N="343" REF="352">
they mu&s;t fall infinitely &s;hort of the poetical Beauty of the Original, yet the good Sen&s;e contained in them will &s;hine through any Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>

<P>YOU de&s;ire my Opinion of <HI>Moliere.</HI> One general Complaint is, that he mixes too much Farce with his Plays. I own, I think &s;o too. <HI>Boileau</HI> has no|ticed <HI>Geronte</HI> in the Sack in the <HI>Four|beries of Scapin.</HI> The <HI>Bourgeois Gentil|homme</HI> ends in a mere Farce and a mo&s;t extravagant one too. The Di&s;pute be|tween
<PB N="344" REF="353">
the two Servants about letting in their Ma&s;ter, is quite a Farce; &s;o is <HI>Toinette</HI>'s acting the Part of the <HI>Doctor</HI> in the <HI>Malade Imaginaire</HI>; nor can I per|ceive why it is introduced. There are many more In&s;tances of this Kind in his Plays. Tho&s;e who defend him &s;ay he was compelled to this by the Humour of the Time; that he had to plea&s;e the Town, as well as the <HI>S&ccedil;avants,</HI> the Peo|ple of Ta&s;te and the Court; and that the Succe&s;s of his Pieces depended on the fir&s;t Set of Hearers, as well as the others. In Truth, I think this no bad Defence, and, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the&s;e Scenes would, in a Farce, be very en|tertaining.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="354">Some &s;ay his Language is not perfectly pure. I will not pretend to decide in that, but the different Characters he brings in ought to be con&s;idered; for Example, in the <HI>Bourgeois Gentilhomme,</HI> when he introduces a <HI>Ga&s;conne,</HI> and a <HI>Pi|carde,</HI> &s;hould he not make them &s;peak the <HI>Patois</HI> of their re&s;pective Countries? Moreover as many of his Plays are not only in Ver&s;e, but in Rhyme, this might be a Con&s;traint, and oblige him often to u&s;e uncouth and ob&s;olete Words.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Objection to <HI>Moliere</HI> is &s;till behind; and that is, that there is &s;ometimes a &s;ort of Deficiency, in the <HI>Denouement</HI> of his Plot. This Objection was made by the great <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Clerc;</HI>
<PB N="346" REF="355">
and I think this is not only true re&s;pect|ing the unravelling of the Story, but, in &s;everal of his Plays, I think his Plot is not conducted with all the Addre&s;s in the World, and that it is even too loo&s;ely put together. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Plots are admirably conducted, and if they have any Fault, it is, that they are &s;o clo&s;ely woven, that, unle&s;s we con&s;ider them very narrowly, the Contexture will e&s;cape us; but then they add great Beauty and Grace to the Piece, when unfolded and brought in View. This is par|ticularly evinced in his <HI>Way of the World,</HI> where every thing is judiciou&s;ly linked to|gether, and each Incident ari&s;es naturally out of the other. In my next, I &s;hall &s;end my Thoughts on <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Beauties, which greatly exceed his Faults.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favoured with yours of the 18th in&s;tant, and &s;hall an&s;wer the latter Part of it fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e People, who&s;e De&s;cription you have noted, are the antient <HI>Belgians,</HI> and their Neighbourhood, which contains
<PB N="348" REF="357">
<HI>Holland, Flanders,</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> the Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>Triers, Liege, Juliers, Cleve,</HI> and <HI>Berg.</HI> You will under&s;tand &s;uch De&s;criptions better, if you will apply to a Map of <HI>Europe.</HI> Be&s;ide that it is u&s;eful to point out the Situation of Places, it will make your reading more plea&s;ant. By the&s;e Means you will &s;ee how our Armies abroad lie, what Way they march, what Towns are be&s;ieged and taken. When we hear News, or read Hi&s;tory, and have no Knowledge of the Situation of Towns, Countries, Rivers, Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we receive little Plea&s;ure, and le&s;s In&s;truction, from what we hear and read.</P>
<P>It is reported that Elephants never lie down to &s;leep, on Account of the Stiffne&s;s
<PB N="349" REF="358">
of their Joints, which makes them un|able to ri&s;e; therefore, when they are inclined to &s;leep, they lean again&s;t a Tree. The Indians, in order to catch them, &s;aw the Tree half a&s;under, or more, which giving Way, the Bea&s;t falls. This, perhaps, is fabulous, for they have much better Methods to catch them; but the Story may &s;erve well enough to build a Simile upon.</P>
<P>I think the Simile of Night exceeding fine, but defective; you &s;hould con&s;ider, it is not Night only, but Silence al&s;o that he is de&s;cribing. <HI>Virgil</HI> takes in the Winds and Waves, the &s;ilent March of the Stars;
<Q><L>The Winds no longer whi&s;per thro' the Woods,</L>
<L>Nor murm'ring Tides di&s;turb the gentle Floods,</L>
<L><PB N="350" REF="359">The Stars in &s;ilent Order march'd around,</L>
<L>And Peace, with downy Wings, was brooding on the Ground.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is Part of the De&s;cription only, and infinitely &s;hort of the Original; it is in the fourth Book of the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> The la&s;t of the&s;e Lines contains, in the Ori|ginal, but four Words, and literally tran&s;lated, &s;ignifies, "When every Field held its Tongue." What <HI>Dryden</HI> calls
<Q>To haunt the Woods, or &s;wim the weedy Pool,</Q>
is in <HI>Virgil,</HI> <Q>which inhabit the Coun|try, that is rough with Shrubs and Bu&s;hes, and the wide-extended liquid Lakes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="360"><HI>Virgil</HI> gives us none but beautiful Ideas. Why does <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> pre&s;ent us with <HI>the Serpent's Hi&s;s, and Dragon's Cry?</HI> I own they are natural, but they are al&s;o frightful, and, as <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> &s;ays, they <HI>make Night hideous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> makes every thing to be at Re&s;t, but <HI>Dido.</HI> It was for her Sake the De&s;cription was brought in; and the Exce&s;s of her Pa&s;&s;ion and Di&s;tre&s;s is va&s;tly heightened by the beautiful Pic|ture of every thing being at Re&s;t, ex|cept her&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> makes all at Re&s;t, but the Mu&s;ic of the Spheres. This is injudicious. What has the Mu&s;ic of the Spheres to do here? It is an old, idle Fancy; be|&s;ides,
<PB N="352" REF="361">
as <HI>Hudibras</HI> &s;ays, We hear it not; why then was it excepted? or how can a Noi&s;e, which is not heard, lull the World to Re&s;t? I give you this as a Specimen of the &s;uperior Judgment of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and the Beauty that ari&s;es therefrom; notwith&s;tanding I allow, that <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s De&s;cription, with the&s;e Abate|ments, has its Merit. If you would read <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> carefully, e&s;pecially his Con|tra&s;t of <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Statius,</HI> you would &s;ee how natural and judicious the former is, and how much the latter falls &s;hort of him.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU a&s;k my Advice in many Points, wherein I think you are able per|fectly to direct your&s;elf. Your Conduct, in general, is very &s;atisfactory to me, and I believe, to your Mama; however, to the be&s;t of my Ability, I will comply with your Reque&s;t, and it will be no Burthen to have two or three &s;pare Rules by you.</P>
<P>In one Part of your Letter, you de&s;ire a Plan to live by. I never could live
<PB N="354" REF="363">
by a Plan my&s;elf, con&s;equently am unfit to lay down one to you; and I love my own Liberty too well, to abridge that of other People.</P>
<P>I believe one very general Error in young Folks is a too great Readine&s;s to make Acquaintance. This ought to be mo&s;t warily guarded again&s;t. Much of our Happine&s;s, Reputation, end Welfare, depends upon the Choice of Intimates.</P>
<P>A proper Divi&s;ion of Time is another very material Point. I am as much a Friend to innocent Recreations, as to Bu|&s;ine&s;s. The only Nicety is to &s;teer be|tween too clo&s;e an Application to the latter, and an Exce&s;s in the former. Your little Neighbour, Mi&s;s D&mdash;, will
<PB N="355" REF="364">
live to repent her ill Cu&s;tom of &s;itting up late at Night, and loitering a-bed in the Morning. Few Things are more pre|judicial to Bu&s;ine&s;s, Reputation and Health. A thou&s;and Inconveniencies are entailed, which are not dreamed of at fir&s;t. She might break her&s;elf of it ea&s;ily now, and may find it very hard &s;ome Years hence. I once loved it as well as &s;he does, yet I got over it, and now ri&s;e every Day between &s;ix and &s;even.</P>
<P>A proper Divi&s;ion of Time pre&s;erves us from being hurried at one Time, and made languid and weary at another; it gives a <HI>Gout</HI> to Diver&s;ion, and makes Bu|&s;ine&s;s &s;it light and ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="365">A proper Choice of Companions, at your early Time of Life chiefly, is of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence. There is great Truth in the old Proverb, <Q>A Man is e&s;teemed according to the Company he keeps;</Q> for &s;uch as our Company is, &s;uch, in great Mea&s;ure, &s;hall we our|&s;elves be. We fall in&s;en&s;ibly, and al|mo&s;t unavoidably, into the Manners, Air, Sentiments, and Turn of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, with whom we conver&s;e much, e&s;pecially in our early Years, &s;o that young People cannot be too much on their Guard in this Particular. Our Reputation is al&s;o affected by the Company we keep. Is there any thing oftner heard than this, and when nothing el&s;e perhaps can be alledged, <Q>Ay, &s;uch a young Man, or &s;uch a Girl, is very good, but too

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 22, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I begin to have but few Franks, I mu&s;t put two or three Letters into one.</P>
<P>I am ready to an&s;wer your Que&s;tions about dividing your Time aright, and
<PB N="359" REF="368">
to give you the be&s;t Directions I can on that Point. It is of the greate&s;t Moment to Happine&s;s. Your de&s;iring Information on this Head plea&s;es me much, though, as I &s;aid before, I think you do not &s;tand in need of it; however, I will expre&s;s my&s;elf as if you did, that I may give my Meaning more clear, and to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot enter minutely into Particu|lars; tho&s;e mu&s;t occur to your&s;elf, as Circum&s;tances, Times, and Occa&s;ions fall out; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve &s;ome general Things, and explain and illu&s;trate them to you in the be&s;t Manner I can.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, in order to employ Time well, to lay it out to Purpo&s;e, and in
<PB N="360" REF="369">
due Proportions, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that you have Time in your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Que&s;tion then is, how to purcha&s;e a &s;ufficient Quantum, or Mea&s;ure of Time. This is not &s;o hard for you, now, at lea&s;t, as for many People, who&s;e Time belongs to others, not to them|&s;elves; who perhaps are Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es of Families, who have Ware-Hou&s;es, or Shops to look after, or &s;ome other Charge, that requires great Por|tions of their Time. Be that as it may, a certain Stock of Time is nece&s;&s;ary for Bu&s;ine&s;s, for Improvement, and for all the nece&s;&s;ary Functions of Life; Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, and even Recreation and Diver&s;ion; for the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary too; but always in Order to qualify us
<PB N="361" REF="370">
for &s;ome better and more important Purpo&s;es; and are to be u&s;ed as Means to attain &s;ome End we aim at, and not as the Things them&s;elves.</P>
<P>How then are we to purcha&s;e this <HI>Stock of Time?</HI> Without this by us, our Time, however judiciou&s;ly di&s;tri|buted, will not an&s;wer. For Example, if I have but a Crown to go to Market with, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have Things to the Value of a Guinea, let me lay out my Money ever &s;o prudently, it will not &s;erve my Purpo&s;e. Herein is evinced the va&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity of purcha&s;ing as great a Fund of Time, as we can.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e I know no one parti|cular Thing &s;o conducive, as ri&s;ing early.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="371">We then have the whole Day before us, can dre&s;s in Time, breakfa&s;t in Time, go abroad or &s;tay at Home, as Affairs demand; if the former, we are &s;ure of meeting People at the ordinary Hours of Meals, Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Diver&s;ion; be&s;ide, the Mind is more fre&s;h, active, and &s;trong to apply to Study, or any other Employment that requires us.</P>
<P><Q>An Hour in the Morning is worth three in the Afternoon,</Q> is a common Proverb, and I never knew a truer. The Light, Heat, and Air of the Day is much more healthy and chearful than the cold dark Damps, and Inconveniency of the Night. The brute Creation teaches us this. The dumb Creatures retire early to Re&s;t, and get up betimes, to bu&s;y
<PB N="363" REF="372">
them&s;elves in Que&s;t of Food, or in bring|ing forth, or bringing up their Young, or in providing for the Winter. Nature in&s;tructs them that the Light and Warmth of the Sun makes that the Time of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but if we will &s;it up in the Dead, and Damps, and Darkne&s;s of the Night, expo&s;ed to the Vapours of that unwhole|&s;ome Sea&s;on, we mu&s;t lie late, and there|by lo&s;e a great Part of the proper Time for Bu&s;ine&s;s or Study; we mu&s;t breakfa&s;t when others dine, dine when others &s;up, and &s;up when they &s;leep; &s;o that our Time is, as I may &s;ay, quite disjointed, and can never hit or &s;quare with the Times of Bu&s;ine&s;s, Meals, or Vi&s;its of other People. By the&s;e Irregularities, every Thing goes to Di&s;order and Confu|&s;ion; and be&s;ide the Lo&s;s of &s;o much
<PB N="364" REF="373">
Time, (and that the proper Time) the Indolence and Inactivity, that late-&s;itting-up and late lying-a-bed creates, renders us quite unfit and unapt for making U&s;e of the Re&s;idue of Time left for Action.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> has painted this &s;o ju&s;t and &s;trong in one of the Poems, which I co|pied out for you, that I need not expa|tiate further on it.</P>
<P>Would not a Merchant be laughed at for a Fool or Madman, who &s;hould loiter away his Time till the Exchange were &s;hut, a Mini&s;ter till the Time of Divine Service were pa&s;t, a Lawyer till the Courts were up, or a Phy&s;ician till the Patient were pa&s;t Recovery, or dead? It is ju&s;t as ridiculous and fooli&s;h in us, to mi&s;-time,
<PB N="365" REF="374">
time the common Affairs, and Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Life. <HI>Solomon,</HI> I think, &s;ays, <Q>The &s;lothful Man ploweth in Har|ve&s;t;</Q> meaning that he mi&s;-times his Affairs, and neglects to &s;ow his Grain, till others are going to reap theirs.</P>
<P>Another Means of purcha&s;ing Time, is, when we fore&s;ee a Crowd of Things coming on us together, and that we &s;hall be hurried, to &s;teal &s;ome Time before hand, if we can, to do &s;ome Part of it, or block it, as we &s;ay, and prepare it &s;o that it may become more ea&s;y and light.</P>
<P>I have a great Number of Affairs to do to-morrow; I fore&s;aw them ye&s;ter|day. I therefore cho&s;e to let Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash; make a Vi&s;it then. I &s;eized the Time,
<PB N="366" REF="375">
I had ye&s;terday Afternoon to my&s;elf. I have wrote &s;everal Letters, which are not to go till to-morrow; have put my Papers in Order, and made a Beginning, in having di&s;patched all preparatory Work. I only mention this, to illu&s;trate to you what I mean.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give you the Re&s;pite of a Day or two, before I pur&s;ue this Matter. What I have to &s;ay further will be ea&s;ily di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very well plea&s;ed with your judi|cious Remarks on <HI>Ta&s;&s;o.</HI> I knew you did not prefer <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s De&s;cription of Night to that of <HI>Virgil,</HI> though I thought pro|per to ob&s;erve the Difference of the Choice of Circum&s;tances therein in tho&s;e two Poets.</P>
<P>I wrote to you in my la&s;t about the Purcha&s;ing of Time, and &s;hall here add the following Ob&s;ervation; leaving what I have to &s;ay farther on the Di&s;tribution of Time to another Occa&s;ion. A parti|cular
<PB N="368" REF="377">
Piece of Bu&s;ine&s;s will prevent me for a While.</P>
<P>What &s;ignifies getting Time enough, without being able to u&s;e it? If we are lazy, indolent, or indi&s;po&s;ed, it will be much the &s;ame as if we had it not. It will be like earning a good Meal, with|out a Stomach to dige&s;t it, or an Appe|tite to eat it; &s;o that if we have ever &s;o much Time, and have not Application, or if we are what the French call <HI>di&s;&s;ip&eacute;,</HI> it can be of very little Advantage to us.</P>
<P>In order then to fit us for the right Employment of Time, our Mind ought to be cool and &s;erene, our Thoughts clear, our Spirits in Vigour, but undi&s;|turbed, and not in a Flurry. The Means
<PB N="369" REF="378">
to attain this Di&s;po&s;ition is to endeavour to be in good Health of Body. There is a &s;trange Sympathy and Connection be|tween the Body and Mind; the one is &s;eldom well, when the other is out of Order. I am not going to pre&s;cribe to you as a Doctor; not being &s;killed in that Profe&s;&s;ion; but certainly Regula|rity and Moderation, in Eating, Drink|ing, Sleep, Exerci&s;es, Study, Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Diver&s;ions, are the be&s;t Means of pre&s;erving Health, and con&s;equently of attaining an Ea&s;ine&s;s and Calm of Mind, joined with Clearne&s;s and Strength of Thought.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome other Things, that incapacitate us for Study or Bu&s;ine&s;s, which ari&s;e from the Mind it&s;elf. All
<PB N="370" REF="379">
immoderate Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as Grief, An|ger, too earne&s;t De&s;ires, an inordinate Pur&s;uit of Plea&s;ure, or Trifles, and &s;et|ting a too high Value on them, all the&s;e di&s;&s;ipate our Minds, unnerve and weaken them; and at la&s;t &s;ink them, leaving no|thing but the Dregs of Thought behind.</P>
<P>Another Con&s;ideration &s;hould make us &s;till more careful to avoid whatever impairs or de&s;troys our Health of Body, or the Faculties of our Mind. The Body and Mind do not only act upon, and affect one another mutually, but they re-act again and again upon each other; like a Ball to&s;&s;ed to and fro, forward and backward, in a Tennis-Court; Grief, Rage, Envy, or any other violent Pa&s;|&s;ions, do not only di&s;turb and di&s;tract
<PB N="371" REF="380">
the Mind, but they affect the Health; when the Health is affected, the&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ions become more violent, and le&s;s &s;upportable; the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, when be|come more violent, give a new Wound to the Health, which adds fre&s;h Force, or, at lea&s;t, more Malignity, to the Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;o on reciprocally; and if <HI>God,</HI> out of his infinite Goodne&s;s, had not given us &s;uch Con&s;titutions, as &s;ome|times to get the better of all this, <HI>we do not know how,</HI> this Action and Re-action would certainly de&s;troy us; indeed, it very often does.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 2, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have written you my Thoughts, in the be&s;t Manner I can, about pur|cha&s;ing Time, and how that Time may not be u&s;ele&s;s, by our being in an unfit Di&s;po&s;ition to u&s;e it. The Que&s;tion now is, how that Time ought to be di&s;tribut|ed, laid out, or be&s;towed.</P>
<P>There are two or three general Rules I would have you ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, reckon with your&s;elf, how much Time &s;uch or &s;uch a Thing may take,
<PB N="373" REF="382">
then how much &s;uch another Thing, and &s;o on, and divide and di&s;tribute your Time accordingly.</P>
<P>But then in the next, or rather in the fir&s;t Place, you ought to make a &s;ort of Calculation or Reckoning of how many Things you have to do; as for Exam|ple, to-day, or to-morrow, and foreca&s;t in your Mind, in what Order you will do them.</P>
<P>Then con&s;ider what Time is mo&s;t pro|per for the one, and what for the other; what in the Morning, what in the After|noon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By all Means, con&s;ider what is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, what is mo&s;t valuable, what
<PB N="374" REF="383">
de&s;erves mo&s;t Time. Common Sen&s;e, and the univer&s;al Con&s;ent of the World, allow that the&s;e are to be mo&s;t minded; &s;o that if you have Time, the greate&s;t Portion of that, as well as of Care, Pains, Application, and Study, are to be laid out on Things that de&s;erve it be&s;t, or that we are mo&s;t intere&s;ted in, or what mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily done; and if, in Spite of all our Endeavours, we have not Time enough, and are hurried, we ought al|ways to prefer what is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t valuable.</P>
<P>Some People, when hurried either unavoidably, or through their own Fault, will leave nothing undone, but do a little of every thing, and &s;o &s;lubber their Af|fairs, that nothing is done to the Pur|po&s;e;
<PB N="375" REF="384">
whereas it would have been much better in that Hurry, to have left the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary Things ab&s;olutely untouched, till another Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Purcha&s;e of Time will put us out of the Nece&s;&s;ity of being hurried; being in good Health and Spirits will double Time, and keep us from being languid; foreca&s;ting the Particulars will keep us from an Uncertainty and Irre&s;o|lution of what we are to do.</P>
<P>The due Di&s;tribution of Time, and chu&s;ing the mo&s;t proper Sea&s;ons, is nece&s;|&s;ary to doing Things well and effec|tually.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="385">The Preference of Things, or Studies, that are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, valuable, or profitable, will always make our Bu|&s;ine&s;s and Study mo&s;t advantageous to us.</P>
<P>To this I &s;hall add, that in Things indifferent, we ought to con&s;ult our Bent and Humour; if it is not inclined to what is trifling, or wor&s;e, to what our Genius is fitte&s;t for. We &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly learn much more, and more to the Pur|po&s;e, when we apply to what we have a Turn for, than to what is <HI>again&s;t the Grain.</HI></P>
<P>I only hint the&s;e Points to you, with|out expatiating on them, which indeed I have not Time for at pre&s;ent, nor do
<PB N="377" REF="386">
I think it needful. Your own good Sen&s;e will &s;ee into the Truth of them, and reflect and enlarge upon them.</P>
<P>I own, &s;uch is human Frailty, that we cannot, at all Times, come up to the &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of them, even with all our Endeavours; but we &s;hould &s;urely &s;trive to do it, in the Main, and as forcibly as we are able.</P>
<P>I own too, that Sickne&s;s, Indi&s;po&s;i|tion, unfore&s;een Accidents, Vi&s;its, Avo|cations, and Interruptions of many Sorts, and even Bu&s;ine&s;s it&s;elf, will break in on the&s;e Rules; but they ought not &s;urely to be wholly neglected, becau&s;e they cannot be preci&s;ely kept.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="387">The&s;e Rules are general, and will al|ways hold true, at lea&s;t, in my humble Opinion; and if they always hold true, we &s;hould always endeavour to keep to them, with tho&s;e Allowances above. I do not think I need trouble you with any more of this Kind, nor in|deed do I immediately recollect any; but there are &s;ome particular Things, which, in a long Cour&s;e of Time, I have ob&s;erved; the&s;e are a &s;ort of <HI>Knacks,</HI> if I may call them &s;o, of &s;tudying, or doing Bu&s;ine&s;s in an u&s;eful Way. Every Man, I &s;uppo&s;e, has &s;ome of tho&s;e peculiar to him&s;elf, and there may be many which I never heard of; but &s;uch as have been ob&s;erved by me I &s;hall make the Subject of my next Letter; and I am confident, from Experience,
<PB N="379" REF="388">
that they cannot fail of being very &s;er|viceable to any Per&s;on, who plea&s;es to practi&s;e them.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 7, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 4th of this Month, with which I am very well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="389">I would fain give you a true Idea of the Importance of the few Rules or Directions which I offered you in my late Letters.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider then that our Time is li|mited; we have but a certain Portion of Time to live, and even That of the longe&s;t Liver is but very &s;hort. How great a Part of it is taken up in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Dre&s;&s;ing, Company, Avocations, Interruptions, and many other Functions of Life, that are ne|ce&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;able, or, at lea&s;t, unavoidable! Add to the&s;e, Indi&s;po&s;i|tion, Sickne&s;s, the Decays of old Age, and the Cares of Life, which grow upon us daily.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="390">But if we were to live ever &s;o long, pray con&s;ider that our Under&s;tandings and Memories are limited, and are very &s;hort and imperfect; even tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who&s;e Memories are &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t tena|cious, can retain but very few Things, in Compari&s;on with what they &s;ee, hear, read, and ob&s;erve. Many Things &s;lide out of our Memories, &s;ome &s;ooner, others later, and many make no Impre&s;|&s;ion at all.</P>
<P>In like Manner, our Under&s;tandings are limited; &s;ome can comprehend more, others le&s;s; but the highe&s;t Pitch, that human Under&s;tanding can fly to, is but very low. There are moreover Thou|&s;ands of Things, that, if we &s;hould rack our Under&s;tandings ever &s;o much, we
<PB N="382" REF="391">
can never attain to the Knowledge and Comprehen&s;ion of; they lye without the Sphere and Province of our Con|ception, or, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>beyond the Length of our Tether.</HI></P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers &s;ay, there are certain Cells in the Brain, &s;ome of which are the Seats of our Rea&s;on or Under&s;tand|ings, and others of our Memory. Some are more capacious than others; others not &s;o capacious, but hold, what they receive better; however there is but a limited Number, and, when full, they can hold no more; or, at lea&s;t, new Ideas, when they take Place, ju&s;tle out the old ones.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="392">If Time were to endure for ever, or very long, we need not be &s;o &s;olicitous of hu&s;banding it well; or, &s;hort as it is, if our Under&s;tandings and Memories were infinite, or, at lea&s;t, of a va&s;t Compa&s;s, we could do a great deal in a &s;mall Space. But as the wi&s;e Author of our Being has di&s;po&s;ed Things otherwi&s;e, ought we not to obey the Limitation he has pre&s;cribed us?</P>
<P>To divide and di&s;tribute our Time aright, &s;hould we not endeavour to be in a Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind and Body, to be able to take Time, when Time is, and to chu&s;e fit and proper Periods for acting, and when we are di&s;po&s;ed and capable to u&s;e Time?</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="393">Ought we not to prefer what is pro|per, u&s;eful, worthy and nece&s;&s;ary, to that which is le&s;s &s;o? much more to Trifles, (unle&s;s for Diver&s;ion or Recreation) and, mo&s;t of all, to what is bad, hurtful, or vicious?</P>
<P>If you, or I, or any one el&s;e, wa&s;te Time in reading u&s;ele&s;s Books, or in &s;ome impertinent Thing or frivolous Employ, the idle Ideas we lay up ju&s;|tle, or keep out, as many good and whole&s;ome ones; if they &s;lide away, and leave Room for better, which is the be&s;t that can befall us in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, we have, at lea&s;t, lo&s;t &s;o much Time; but if they fix on our Memory and Un|der&s;tanding, then indeed our State is doubly mi&s;erable. I &s;till except nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="385" REF="394">
Recreations, and the particular Trades or Bu&s;ine&s;s, wherein we are brought up, and by which we mu&s;t get a Lively|hood; many whereof are in them&s;elves trifling enough, but then they are ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as being the Means of Sub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Now if the proper Times and parti|cular Sea&s;ons of Application, and when we are fit and capable to apply, are to be watched and taken, how much more is the Time of Life, in general, which is fitte&s;t for us, and to which we are be&s;t &s;uited, to be well and diligently ap|plied? I mean, the Time of our Youth, when the Journey of Life is before us, when we have mo&s;t Lei&s;ure, before we are engaged in the Cares and Concerns
<PB N="386" REF="395">
of the World we are to &s;truggle through; when our Minds are mo&s;t pliable, and when we receive the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ions; when we have a certain Facility both of taking up Things, and retaining them&mdash;On all Accounts, therefore, Youth is the mo&s;t proper Sea|&s;on to lay in a Fund for carrying us through the World with Comfort, and Joy, and Innocence, and Credit. How many Wretches do we &s;ee of both Sexes, who, for Want of this Precaution and Provi&s;ion, lead mi&s;erable and di&s;graceful Lives, and come to an untimely and &s;hameful End!</P>
<P>There is one Thing in regard to the Narrowne&s;s of our Under&s;tanding, which give me Leave to mention to you.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="396">Some Things are hard, and require much Attention to be comprehended aright. If the&s;e Things are nece&s;&s;ary, or worth our While, the Difficulty ought not to frighten us; but if they are other|wi&s;e, we &s;hould not break our Heads about them. Some have a Genius for one Thing, &s;ome for another; and it is wonderful to ob&s;erve how ready and able &s;ome People are to learn &s;ome Things, and how hard it is to make them comprehend others, which one would think much ea&s;ier.</P>
<P><HI>Pope</HI> has treated this with great Ju&s;|tice, &s;omewhere in his Works; I think it is in the fourth Book of his <HI>Dunciad.</HI> He laughs at the Practice of our Schools and Colleges, where they &s;et every Boy
<PB N="388" REF="397">
to the making of Ver&s;es, without con|&s;idering whether he has Talents for it or no.</P>
<P>I have been often told that the Je&s;uits abroad take a quite different Method with their Pupils. They carefully &s;tudy the Temper and Turn of Mind, and when they have di&s;covered that, they then &s;et them to that which their Genius is mo&s;t &s;uited to.</P>
<P>But &s;ome Things lie quite out of the Reach of our Under&s;tanding. All the natural Philo&s;ophers, that have been or are now in the World, have not hitherto been able to account for Thou&s;ands of Things, that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us every Day; why, for Example, the Gra&s;s
<PB N="389" REF="398">
is green, the Ro&s;e red, the Lily white, the Cow&s;lip yellow, the Violet blue, the Tulip variegated or party-coloured; why a certain Sort of Tree always bears an Apple, another a Pear, a third a Plumb, and &s;o forth, with Millions of other Things. We have but few Faculties, and fewer Sen&s;es, which are the Inlets of all Knowledge. All the De&s;criptions and Definitions that can be made, will never give a Man, who was born blind, the lea&s;t Idea or Notion of a Colour, or one born deaf, any Notion of Sound. Things being thus, how idle is it in People to puzzle them&s;elves with Ob|jects that lie without the Sphere of their Knowledge or Comprehen&s;ion! And if it be &s;o in the&s;e le&s;&s;er Matters, how ra&s;h is it, with regard to the high and tre|mendous
<PB N="390" REF="399">
My&s;teries of our Religion, in pre&s;uming Men to endeavour to explain them to others, who cannot comprehend them them&s;elves!</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> Father to the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> did more Hurt to Re|ligion, (at lea&s;t in my Opinion) though unde&s;ignedly, by endeavouring to explain the <HI>Trinity,</HI> than if he had wrote a Trea|ti&s;e again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Others pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and prophanely contemn and deride, de&s;perately reject and renounce our Holy Religion, and the &s;acred Trea&s;ures of the Scripture, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they cannot compre|hend every thing taught there; as if

nothing could be true, but what they could account for; although they &s;ee ten thou&s;and Things every Day, that are obvious to their Sen&s;es, and yet not one of them can be accounted for by the Wit of all Mankind put to|gether.</P>
<P>Such Scoffers as the&s;e would per|haps term what I am &s;aying <HI>Cant</HI>; they have many low Arts and Expre&s;&s;ions, to &s;upport each other in &s;uch vain Tenets, as are not to be ju&s;tified by Rea&s;on.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Re&s;ume my Di&s;cour&s;e on the Employ|ment of Time.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the few general Rules, which every Body &s;hould ob&s;erve as much as
<PB N="393" REF="402">
their Health and Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind and Bu&s;ine&s;s will allow them, there are &s;ome particular Things, which, if ob&s;erved, will, in my Opinion, tend much to our be&s;towing Time to Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But there is one of the&s;e general Rules, which I mu&s;t again recommend, as a certain Knack or No&s;trum to make Time pa&s;s ea&s;ily and profitably, and that is what I called <HI>foreca&s;ting</HI> what we have to do, or what we de&s;ign to read or &s;tudy; for In&s;tance, in the Evening what we are to do next Day, or in the Morning, what we are to do all Day, or for two or three Days to come.</P>
<P>There are many excellent Effects fol|low on this Method;</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="403">Fir&s;t, we find hereby when we &s;hall have a void Space of Time; we can therefore fill it up with &s;ome|thing that would oppre&s;s us afterwards; or we can beforehand, if we have no Bu&s;ine&s;s that will hurry us after, contrive &s;omething to do or read, or &s;ome Di|ver&s;ion that would encroach too much on Bu&s;ine&s;s at another Time, or contrive our Vi&s;its &s;o as not to encroach on Bu|&s;ine&s;s at all.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o give us a View of all we had to do, at once, &s;o that we &s;hould not only proportion our Time aright, but even chu&s;e the fitte&s;t Time for every Branch of our Bu&s;ine&s;s and Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="404">We &s;hould moreover not be at a Lo&s;s or Doubt, what to do fir&s;t, or whether to do &s;uch a Thing or not. I have often felt, that, when I was &s;urpri&s;ed with an idle Space of Time, for Want of having forca&s;ted what I was to do, I continued in Doubt and Irre&s;olution, and in a &s;aun|tering Di&s;po&s;ition, and as much to &s;eek, as when I happened to be &s;urpri&s;ed with a Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, not knowing where or how to begin. This is the Rea&s;on that &s;o many People are longer in be|ginning and falling to Action, than others are in compleating it. Many People have I &s;een come to a Friend's Hou&s;e, in order to &s;pend an Afternoon, but pre&s;ently, perhaps, they remembered they had &s;omething to do, then away they would go; then, perhaps, change
<PB N="396" REF="405">
their Minds and come back again, I have &s;een People go in and out of a Cof|fee-Hou&s;e, three or four Times in half an Hour; or go, perhaps, along half a Street, then turn &s;hort, and go another Way, or turn back. All this comes from not foreca&s;ting what they have to do, and not having re&s;olved to do what they have &s;uddenly taken into their Heads.</P>
<P>No Doubt, you have &s;een all this as well as I, and I do not &s;ay that I have not been guilty of it as well as others.</P>
<P>I have been in Company where I have &s;een People that were for the Park; then for Vaux-Hall, and not the Park; then for neither, but for the Play-Hou&s;e; then
<PB N="397" REF="406">
not for that, but for the Tavern; yet, at la&s;t, went to none of them. My God! how unea&s;y are the&s;e People to them|&s;elves, and often to others! All proceeds, I &s;ay, from not foreca&s;ting Things be|forehand, and Want of Re&s;olution to exe|cute what they intend. In &s;hort, the good Effects of Foreca&s;t are &s;o vi&s;ible, and the bad Effects of the Want of it &s;o obvious, that I need not longer dwell upon it.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO re&s;ume my Di&s;cour&s;e on Time&mdash; The la&s;t Rule, I think, that I wi&s;hed to be ob&s;erved, to &s;top weari|&s;ome
<PB N="401" REF="410">
Gaps in Time, was either to pre|pare &s;omething that we know is before our Hand, or re&s;ume &s;omething that we had not Time to fini&s;h. This is an ex|cellent Method of keeping our&s;elves from Indolence and Idlene&s;s, and forwarding our Bu&s;ine&s;s, Study, or Knowledge; and nothing &s;o much contributes to make this ea&s;y and practicable, as fore-laying every thing we have to do. When we look before us, we &s;hall &s;ee what Time we are like to be di&s;engaged, and then we can provide for the right U&s;e of that Time.</P>
<P>Another Point I would recommend, is as follows. When we have not any thing to prepare beforehand, nor any thing to do that was obliged to be left
<PB N="402" REF="411">
undone, &s;uppo&s;e we were to think of &s;ome By-Study, or u&s;eful Matter to em|ploy our&s;elves in, that &s;hould touch us but on &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>For Example, Nancy, what if you, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, &s;hould get the U&s;e of &s;ome News-Papers, particularly the Ge|neral or London Evening Po&s;t, read them over, and even the Adverti&s;ements? You would there find many Things, of which you have, as yet, perhaps, no Idea. As all <HI>Europe</HI> is now in Motion, you would hereby have a Conception of what is doing, and what you cannot mi&s;s to hear talked of; and if you would lay out a Trifle on a Map of <HI>Europe</HI> in general, and of the particular Countries likewi&s;e, and con&s;ult your Maps for every Thing
<PB N="403" REF="412">
you read about, it would be a very fine, and no unprofitable, Amu&s;ement; for by this Means, and, as it were, by Way of Diver&s;ion, you would come to un|der&s;tand Geography, and comprehend what is now &s;o much in the Mouths of all the World. This would give you the Plea&s;ure of under&s;tanding what you hear and read, of forming, with &s;ome Exactne&s;s, an Idea of the Countries and Actions you read of, which none can do, who know not the Situations of Places, where the Scene of Action lies. Such Per&s;ons as know not, for Exam|ple, where <HI>France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c. are, whether they lie Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, or South, or how they lie in re&s;pect to each other, or whe|ther they are near or far off, what Plea|&s;ure
<PB N="404" REF="413">
can they have in <HI>Prince Charles's</HI> pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Rhine,</HI> or what Notion can they have of his Marches, and the Marches of his Enemies? Why really, &s;carce any.</P>
<P>I would not, however, have you be either a great Geographer, or News-Monger; but this would not only be plea&s;ant Amu&s;ement in idle Hours, but would enable you to have right Notions and Ideas of Things that are often talked of. Now this, or &s;ome &s;uch Employ, I would have you &s;et apart only for the Hours you find your&s;elf languid in; but, by no means, let it encroach on the Times of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and when you are more nece&s;&s;arily, and more impor|tantly engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="414">There is another Thing, in which Time that lies heavy on our Hands might be &s;till more u&s;efully employed, and that is, in doing &s;ome Handy-Work. I have many Times regretted that I ne|ver learned to do, or make, &s;ome u&s;eful Thing or other, to fill up the&s;e tedious Intervals. I have known Gentlemen learn to Draw, or Play on &s;ome In&s;tru|ment, or Work at &s;ome u&s;eful Art, e&s;pecially <HI>Turning,</HI> which is ea&s;ily learn|ed; and I have &s;een a Lady lately &s;it five or &s;ix Hours at making Nets, Flow|ering or Embroidering.

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote you three Days ago; what I have more to &s;ay will not take up much Time, but I &s;hall &s;pin it out to two Letters.</P>
<P>One Thing earne&s;tly to be recom|mended, as the Means of making either Study or Bu&s;ine&s;s u&s;eful and effectual, is to improve the Times and Circum|&s;tances, that favour them. There are certain Sea&s;ons and Occa&s;ions, by, and
<PB N="407" REF="416">
in, which we can profit more than others. I do not only mean what I wrote formerly about the proper Times of the Day for this or that, and the Times when we find our&s;elves in the be&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition, or when the be&s;t Op|portunities offer, (tho' the&s;e are to be greatly noticed) yet I now mean &s;ome|thing more.</P>
<P>There are Accidents or Circum&s;tances, that contribute much to make deep Impre&s;&s;ions on the Mind and Memory. For Example, when we hear any Thing that is <HI>new</HI> to us; this excites the Cu|rio&s;ity, and is a proper Time to inform our&s;elves about it. When a Thing is &s;trange or &s;urpri&s;ing, or when it comes newly in Vogue, or when we hear
<PB N="408" REF="417">
many People talk about a Book, or other Matter, or commend, or di&s;com|mend it, or when we hear different Characters of &s;ome Circum&s;tance or Au|thor, or when People conte&s;t and di&s;|pute about any Thing, then the Mind is excited; and &s;uch Opportunities of Improvement are never to be neglected, unle&s;s the Subject is of no Concern; but even in that Ca&s;e, People will remem|ber, or be curious to know Things in &s;uch Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Not only Things that are new, un|common, or extraordinary, make deep Impre&s;&s;ions, but what we learn, hear, read, or do, at &s;uch Times, make deep Impre&s;&s;ions too. There is a certain Con|nection of Ideas that I cannot account
<PB N="409" REF="418">
for, by which they are drawn along, as by a Chain of different Links. You have heard People &s;ay, <Q>I remember &s;uch a Circum&s;tance very well, be|cau&s;e &s;uch a Thing happened at that Time, or I was in &s;uch a Place.</Q> If we change our u&s;ual Place of Re&s;i|dence, or our cu&s;tomary Way of Life, we &s;hall, for &s;ome little While, remem|ber better what happened, or what we read, heard, or &s;aw, in that Interval, than what occurs ordinarily; and I have often ob&s;erved, when I have come to a Place or Company, from which I had been &s;ome Time ab&s;ent, my former Thoughts have then come back into my Mind, tho' perhaps I had never once reflected on them, from the Time
<PB N="410" REF="419">
I had been before in that Place or Com|pany.</P>
<P>It is for this Rea&s;on, that tho&s;e who teach <HI>the Art of Memory,</HI> lay down this Rule; namely, that <HI>when we have many Things to remember, we &s;hould join the Idea of &s;ome very known Place, Per&s;on, or Circum&s;tance, to the Thing, we would remember</HI>; and we even &s;ee People, who never &s;tudied Rules, very commonly u&s;e this Method. How often have we heard People &s;ay, <Q>This, that, or the other Circum&s;tance, will make me remem|ber her &s;uch a Particular, or &s;uch, or &s;uch a Thing recalls it to my Mind.</Q></P>

<P>THE next Thing, I would recom|mend, is to conquer that Indolence, which &s;ome People are, either con&s;titu|tionally or habitually, encumbered with. I know this is a very hard Le&s;&s;on, and what I could never ab&s;olutely be Ma&s;ter of my&s;elf. What is accompanied with Difficulties, or what is not to our Ta&s;te, we bring our&s;elves to do with great Re|luctance; and we &s;atisfy our&s;elves with any Sort of Excu&s;e, to put it off and delay it, from Time to Time. I have often experienced this in my&s;elf; but if
<PB N="412" REF="421">
the Thing we thus fly from, is either nece&s;&s;ary or proper, we ought, by all Means, to compel our&s;elves to do it, and even offer Violence to our Tempers, to overcome this Indolence. The be&s;t Method I know for this, is to take the fir&s;t Opportunity when we are in a pro|per Di&s;po&s;ition, and <HI>to make a Beginning.</HI> Thus all the Poets and Philo&s;ophers advi&s;e. <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;ays, "He, who has made a good Beginning, has half-ended his Bu&s;ine&s;s."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Dimidium, Qui bene caepit, habet."</NOTE> <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> &s;ay the &s;ame; <HI>Incipe,</HI> that is, <HI>Begin,</HI> is their con&s;tant Rule. I will not give you the Tran&s;lation of a noble Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Ho|race,</HI> it is &s;o wretchedly rendered, but
<PB N="413" REF="422">
one of our Poets &s;ays, much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e,
<Q><L>Begin &mdash;</L>
<L>Defer not till to-morrow to be wi&s;e,</L>
<L>To-morrow's Sun to thee may never ri&s;e.</L></Q>
There is indeed nothing like making once a Beginning in earne&s;t, for, by lit|tle and little, we are reconciled to the Subject and Ta&s;k. Then Difficulties be|gin to vani&s;h, at lea&s;t, they grow &s;mooth|er and ea&s;ier by Degrees, e&s;pecially if we &s;et our Hearts to conquer them; and &s;o, what was once our Aver&s;ion, be|comes, at la&s;t, ea&s;y, and often a Plea|&s;ure to us.</P>
<P>The next Point to be ob&s;erved, is to conquer our Curio&s;ity. When we find
<PB N="414" REF="423">
our Hearts &s;et upon &s;ome Reading, Bu|&s;ine&s;s, or Diver&s;ion, that is improper, we &s;hould endeavour to ma&s;ter that Pa&s;|&s;ion, and make it &s;ubmit to our Advan|tage; otherwi&s;e, every new Thing that &s;urpri&s;es us, or that we are fond of, will make us break off, and turn away from the Pur&s;uit of what is u&s;eful to us.</P>
<P>But in either Ca&s;e, that is, when our Indolence, Aver&s;ion, or Curio&s;ity, is &s;o &s;trong that we cannot conquer it at once, we ought to do it by Degrees. We may be in &s;o unfit a Di&s;po&s;ition, that our Struggling can do us no Good, at one Time; then, perhaps, we had better give Way, for that In&s;tant, re&s;olving not to yield it up, but get the better by Degrees. I have been &s;eized with &s;uch
<PB N="415" REF="424">
a &s;trong Curio&s;ity, that if I had not in|dulged it for that Time, all other Appli|cations had been u&s;ele&s;s; for Example, on Receipt of &s;ome extraordinary News, or Letters long expected, and often on Receipt of Letters from you, that, tho' I had compelled my&s;elf not to read them, (which I could have done) yet I could not have done any Thing el&s;e to Pur|po&s;e, 'till I had peru&s;ed them, &s;o much have they ran in my Head.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE la&s;t Point I would recommend in Study or Bu&s;ine&s;s, is what we call <HI>Method.</HI> The chief Rule herein, where the Nature of the Study requires it, is to get a general Idea of our Sub|ject-Matter, in all its different Parts. When we have &s;een through it, we &s;hould range tho&s;e Parts in &s;ome Order, and fix them in our Mind. Thus &s;een through, the Affair will become much ea&s;ier. Were we even but learning
<PB N="417" REF="426">
&s;ome new Game at Cards, it may be rea&s;onably imagined that this Method will make us comprehend it much bet|ter, and more ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>Our next Care is to be Ma&s;ter of the chief Difficulties, which will &s;till ob|&s;truct our Knowledge, and hang a dead Weight upon us, in the Cour&s;e of our Studies, if not ab&s;olutely ma&s;tered. For In&s;tance, in the French Language, tho&s;e who will not be at the Pains to get the two Auxiliary Verbs <HI>Avoir</HI> and <HI>Etre</HI> perfectly at fir&s;t, will find a heavy Clog lie upon them, through the whole Study of that Tongue, which will co&s;t them ten Times the Pains, that would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to learn them perfectly at fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="427">You know your&s;elf that there are &s;ome Rules of Practice, which make Things ea&s;y; and without which, we may puz|zle our whole Life over, without coming to our Purpo&s;e, or, at be&s;t, &s;pend a long Time, and be&s;tow va&s;t Labour in re&s;ol|ving them.

<P>There is a great Difference between conquering or &s;ubduing our Pa&s;&s;ions, and extingui&s;hing them.

Without them, we &s;hould never be at Pains to do any good or great Action; and therefore when they are &s;ub&s;ervient to our Rea&s;on, they bear the Mind up again&s;t Fatigue, Indolence, and In-appli|cation; but they make &s;ad Work, when they reign and tyrannize over us. What <HI>Horace</HI> has &s;aid of Anger, may be &s;aid of every Pa&s;&s;ion and Appetite. I mu&s;t
<PB N="421" REF="430">
give it you in the di&s;advantageous Tran&s;|lation of <HI>Creech.</HI>
<Q><L>Anger it a &s;hort Frenzy; curb thy Soul,</L>
<L>And check thy Rage, which mu&s;t be rul'd, or rule;</L>
<L>U&s;e all thy Art, with all thy Force re&s;train,</L>
<L>And take the &s;tronge&s;t Bit, and firme&s;t Rein.</L></Q>
It is certain, that if we do not get the Ma&s;tery of our Pa&s;&s;ions, they will be our Ma&s;ters&mdash;<HI>They mu&s;t be ruled, or rule.</HI> Now to apply this to the Difficulty you propo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certainly a proper Oppor|tunity to learn a Thing, when our Cu|rio&s;ity is excited by &s;ome Accident. Then the Application will be vigorous, the
<PB N="422" REF="431">
Impre&s;&s;ions deep, and will continue long. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this, <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> which is the <HI>Image of God</HI> in our Minds, and which di&s;tingui&s;hes us from all the lower Creation, <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> I &s;ay, &s;hould pre&s;ide and controul.</P>
<P>If the Thing our Curio&s;ity is employed about, is worth our While, we may then give the Reins to our Curio&s;ity; otherwi&s;e, let us call in Rea&s;on to our Aid; let her keep her Seat, and do her Office. We mu&s;t then <HI>take our &s;tronge&s;t Bit, and firme&s;t Rein.</HI> This is a Meta|phor, you &s;ee, taken from riding. The Rider is our Rea&s;on, the Hor&s;e, the Pa&s;&s;ions; which we mu&s;t &s;ometimes give the Reins to, &s;ometimes check, &s;ome|times &s;pur and &s;witch, but, at all Times,
<PB N="423" REF="432">
direct and manage. You perceive all this agrees with what was fir&s;t &s;aid, namely, that the Pa&s;&s;ions are to be go|verned, moderated, and &s;ubdued, but not extingui&s;hed, any more than a Hor&s;e, in&s;tead of being broke and trained, ought to be knocked on the Head, or all the Blood in the Body let out to cure a Fever, or the Head to be cut off, to cure a Vertigo.</P>
<P>Again, there is a great Difference be|tween &s;ome &s;trong and &s;udden Gu&s;ts and Fits of Pa&s;&s;ion, Curio&s;ity, for In&s;tance, and an habitual Dominion of the Pa&s;|&s;ions over us. The be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Men may be now and then &s;urprized, as the be&s;t Rider may be thrown, when
<PB N="424" REF="433">
he is not on his Guard, e&s;pecially; now I &s;ay, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, for Example, if a &s;trong Fit of Curio&s;ity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es us, which we cannot conquer, as in the Particulars I mentioned to you, it is bet|ter to yield a little for the Time, than to &s;truggle in vain; yet, by no Means, to let it run into a Habit, but re&s;ume the Reins, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Ju&s;t &s;o, there are &s;ometimes Fits of Indolence, Indi&s;po&s;ition, Wearine&s;s, and Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, if I may call it &s;o, which &s;eize us, and mu&s;t be yielded Way to, for a &s;hort Time; but, if encouraged, are con&s;idera|bly more dangerous than the other; and for this good Rea&s;on, that all active Pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;uch as Curio&s;ity, decrea&s;e in Time, and wear out, or grow weaker by their
<PB N="425" REF="434">
own Activity, as Things in Motion tend to Re&s;t, at la&s;t; but Indolence, the more it is humoured, the more it grows, as Things at Re&s;t never tend to Motion again of them&s;elves, but mu&s;t be put into Motion by a new Force; and if they are heavy Bodies, the longer they lie on the Earth, the deeper they &s;ink into if. This common and daily Expe|rience &s;hews us.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 11, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall now give you the famous Mon&s;. <HI>Des-Cartes</HI> four Rules of Me|thod.</P>
<P>Rule I. <Q>To admit nothing for Truth, but what you hare fully examined, and found to be &s;o true, as that you have no Rea&s;on to doubt it; and to conclude nothing ab&s;olutely, but what you &s;ee clearly to follow from what you have &s;o con&s;idered.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="436">This Rule is of excellent U&s;e, to find out the Truth in Things of Difficulty, or to attain to the Knowledge of what requires Application. But I mu&s;t warn you, that there are many Things, where this is not nece&s;&s;ary, as in Things <HI>qui &s;autent aux Yeux,</HI> as the French &s;ay, Things clear and obvious in them&s;elves, or Things that commonly occur in Life, or are generally known and practi&s;ed; and in Things that do not concern you whether they be true or fal&s;e, and in many trifling Matters. For Want of this Precaution, I have heard of &s;ome Ad|mirers of <HI>Des-Cartes,</HI> who have run into unaccountable Follies, and have given them&s;elves great Di&s;quiet, in applying his Rules on every Occa&s;ion, and have
<PB N="428" REF="437">
thereby made their Lives a Burthen to &s;elves.</P>
<P>Rule II. <Q>That all the Difficulties you are to examine, be divided into &s;uch and &s;o many Parts as are nece&s;&s;ary, in order to attain the Knowledge of what you pur&s;ue.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing on this Rule; I think the U&s;efulne&s;s of it is very plain.</P>
<P>Rule III. <Q>To di&s;po&s;e all the Parti|culars you are to con&s;ider, in the mo&s;t natural Order.</Q></P>
<P>That is, you are to con&s;ider the more &s;imple and plain Things, before the more compounded and perplexed; tho&s;e
<PB N="429" REF="438">
that are nece&s;&s;ary to be fir&s;t under&s;tood, before tho&s;e that ari&s;e out of them. For Example, in Arithmetic, which you un|der&s;tand a little.</P>
<P>A Numeration-Table &s;tands fir&s;t; then we learn to add Numbers to Num|bers; the next Thing that naturally fol|lows, is to take Numbers from Num|bers, which is mo&s;t ea&s;ily learned, after we have learned to add Numbers. This is called Sub&s;traction. After this, Mul|tiplication becomes familiar and ea&s;y; then follows Divi&s;ion, which requires both Addition, Subtraction, and Multi|plication in the Operation.</P>
<P>In <HI>Euclid</HI>'s famous Principles of the Mathematics, called his <HI>Elements,</HI> he pro|ceeds
<PB N="430" REF="439">
in this admirable Method. His fir&s;t Propo&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary to the un|der&s;tanding the &s;econd, the &s;econd to the third, the third to the fourth, and &s;o on. This I think &s;ufficient to explain what I mean.</P>
<P>This Rule, however, only holds good in Things that have a Relation or Con|nection, and Dependence on one ano|ther. As for Example, in learning <HI>French,</HI> as I &s;aid before, we &s;hall be continually at a Lo&s;s, if we do not make our&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the auxiliary Verbs, <HI>avoir</HI> and <HI>&eacute;tre,</HI> becau&s;e they run into every Verb. Yet I think the &s;ure&s;t Way to get the <HI>French</HI> is to begin, after the&s;e two Verbs, with the other Verbs regular and irregular, though they are much
<PB N="431" REF="440">
harder than Nouns, Pronouns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Rea&s;on is, there is no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Connection between the&s;e and Verbs, that they mu&s;t be learned fir&s;t, in order to gain the other; and as we remember be&s;t what we learn fir&s;t in the Study of Languages, I am firmly of Opi|nion, that Verbs ought to be fir&s;t at|tained.</P>
<P>Rule IV. <Q>To be &s;ure to omit no|thing nece&s;&s;ary to be taken into the Con&s;ideration of the Que&s;tion you are in Search of, or the Attainment of what you want to know.</Q></P>
<P>How many People have laboured in vain to come to the Ground of a Difficulty, or even attain the Under&s;tanding of an
<PB N="432" REF="441">
Art or Trade perfectly, by not ob&s;erving this Rule; and perhaps omitting one ne|ce&s;&s;ary Thing, which made all the re&s;t defective!</P>
<P>Some People have thought a fifth Rule nece&s;&s;ary, and indeed I am one of them.</P>
<P>Rule V. <Q>To &s;eparate every thing from the Que&s;tion, that is not per|tinent to the Re&s;olution of the Dif|ficulty.</Q></P>
<P>I have often thought this Rule as ne|ce&s;&s;ary as any of the others. When we take any foreign Matter into the State of a Que&s;tion, or Study of a Point, it embarra&s;&s;es and perplexes us, and carries
<PB N="433" REF="442">
us away on a wrong Scent. You cannot fail to have ob&s;erved this in People, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, Prejudices, Inattention, Igno|rance, or Mi&s;takes, lead them away from the Point in Que&s;tion, and make them wander quite from the true State of it.</P>
<P>The learned have &s;tated two Kinds of Rea&s;oning in the Mind, Di&s;cour&s;e, or Method, as they call it. My next &s;hall be on that Subject, but I &s;hall be very &s;hort, and then I have done.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXLVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 14, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE two Methods I mentioned, my dear Nancy, are termed by the Learned, the Analytic Method, and the Synthetic Method. The&s;e are two Greek Words. The fir&s;t &s;ignifies no more, in plain Engli&s;h, than to re&s;olve, or &s;epa|rate, and take into Pieces; the latter, to compound or lay together; and in all Things that we would learn or know, one or other of the&s;e mu&s;t be followed; for we mu&s;t either &s;eparate the Subject into different Parts, and con&s;ider tho&s;e di&s;tinctly, or we mu&s;t put them toge|ther,
<PB N="435" REF="444">
and con&s;ider them jointly, and &s;ee what will be the Re&s;ult.</P>
<P>But the&s;e two Methods are not indif|ferent to every Sort of Subject. The Nature of &s;ome requires to be con&s;idered analytically, others &s;ynthetically, and to come at the Knowledge of &s;ome Things, both mu&s;t be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>In Grammar, that is, the learning of a Language, the analytical Method is u&s;ed to under&s;tand to read, write, or &s;peak a Language; we con&s;ider the dif|ferent Parts of Speech, as Nouns, Pro|nouns, Verbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In Nouns we con|&s;ider the Sub&s;tantives and Adjectives; we divide them into declinable and indecli|nable; we divide the Declen&s;ions, con|&s;ider
<PB N="436" REF="445">
the different Ca&s;es, Numbers, Gen|ders, and &s;o forth. In Pronouns we con&s;ider the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third Per|&s;on, the demon&s;trative, relative, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ive. Verbs we divide into regular and irregular; then into active, pa&s;&s;ive, neu|ter, and reciprocal; then we con&s;ider them in their different Moods, Ten&s;es, Per&s;ons, and Numbers. This is &s;uffi|cient to make you apprehend the U&s;e|fulne&s;s of this Method, called analytical.</P>
<P>In Logic, that is, the Art of Rea&s;on|ing, we proceed in another Manner. Here we begin with &s;imple Perception, or what is called a &s;ingle Idea. Then we proceed to Judgment, that is, con|&s;idering two Ideas together, and com|paring them and finding the Relation or
<PB N="437" REF="446">
Want of Relation between them. For Example, when we con&s;ider the Ideas of Fire and Heat together, we pronounce "that Fire is hot." When we con&s;ider and compare the Ideas we have of God and Death, or Sin, we find a Want of Relation, or an Incompatibility between them; hence we pronounce, <Q>God is not &s;ubject to Death, or to Sin.</Q></P>
<P>When we have thus formed a Judg|ment, we can go further, and carry on our Rea&s;oning in a Chain; as thus&mdash; <Q>If God cannot &s;in, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be good; if he cannot die, he mu&s;t be eternal.</Q> This is called Di&s;|cour&s;e; which Word does not properly &s;ignify <HI>talking</HI> as we u&s;e it, but rea&s;on|ing, and laying Things together, or
<PB N="438" REF="447">
&s;eparating them, and &s;o finding out In|ferences.</P>
<P>We then proceed to <HI>Method</HI>; which is, ordering and di&s;po&s;ing our Thoughts, &s;o as be&s;t to attain the Knowledge of what we want to find out, by either or both of the afore-mentioned Ways; and all the Art of Logic depends on the&s;e four Operations on the Mind, to wit, Perception, Judgment, Di&s;cour&s;e, and Method.</P>
<P>Thus in Geometry, a <HI>Point</HI> is fir&s;t con&s;idered; next to that a <HI>Line,</HI> which is a Continuation of Points; this gives us the Idea of Length; the next is the Idea of Breadth; from the&s;e two we have the Idea of <HI>Surface</HI>; and when to
<PB N="439" REF="448">
Length and Breadth we take in Depth, we get the Idea of a <HI>Solid.</HI> From the&s;e Ideas ari&s;e all our Notions of Squares, Curves, Triangles, Cubes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with all their Proportions and Relations.</P>
<P>You have now, I doubt not, a ju&s;t Notion of what is called analytical, what &s;ynthetical, and of the U&s;efulne&s;s of their different Operations.</P>
<P>I &s;aid that in &s;ome Studies both Me|thods may be nece&s;&s;ary; and they may be &s;o, either in &s;ome different Parts of a long or intricate Que&s;tion, or even &s;ometimes to the right under&s;tanding of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="449">To give the be&s;t Idea hereof that I can, take this familiar Illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e you wanted to know the Ma|chinery and Movements of a Watch, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to take the whole Movement in Pieces before you, to ex|plain the U&s;e of every Part, to make you ob&s;erve the Shape, Form, and Figure of each, to &s;hew you how it is fitted for &s;uch or &s;uch an U&s;e, or Purpo&s;e, and how its Structure contributes to this U&s;e. This is the <HI>Analytical</HI> Method. But to make you under&s;tand it perfectly, would it not, think you, be proper to put it together again before you, and to &s;hew you thereby how each Part corre&s;ponded with and related to another, and how, from that Con&s;truction and Compo&s;ition, the
<PB N="441" REF="450">
Motions ari&s;e, and were continued, and conducted to the End, for which a Watch was de&s;igned? This is the <HI>Syn|thetical</HI> Method.</P>
<P>In &s;uch an Operation as this, we have Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider every thing duly, and &s;o to admit nothing to be true, that is to &s;ay, fit for the Pur|po&s;e it is &s;aid to be de&s;igned for, un|le&s;s it evidently appears &s;o. Here then is a Di&s;tribution of the Subject into as many Parts as are nece&s;&s;ary; the &s;imple Parts are fir&s;t con&s;idered, then the Connection with others, then the&s;e Parts as compounded, and la&s;tly the whole Frame, Compo&s;ition, or Sy&s;tem. Now if all the&s;e are duly con&s;idered, a nice Di&s;cerner will find out what is
<PB N="442" REF="451">
wanting, and, by that Means, will omit nothing that is nece&s;&s;ary to the Perfec|tion of the Machine; and if there is any thing ami&s;s, or &s;uperfluous, he will be &s;en&s;ible, that it is to be altered, or re|moved. Herein then are the whole five Rules of Method, mentioned in my for|mer Letter, comprized.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Greme</HI> (the be&s;t Watch-Maker, perhaps, that ever was in the World) had not &s;een many Watches both taken a&s;under and put together, and had not con&s;idered every Part nicely by it&s;elf, and the whole when united, he would never have been able to remove &s;ome Things, and to add or alter others, as he has often done, to amazing Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="452">I &s;hall add no more on this Sub|ject, only recommend a Treati&s;e of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s, called <HI>The Conduct of the Un|der&s;tanding.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very well plea&s;ed with your Ob|&s;ervations on <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>; they are both in|genious and ju&s;t, and no Critic needs be a&s;hamed of them.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="453">Since I wrote you la&s;t, our Profe&s;&s;or of Poetry had a public Speech. It was on the Figure <HI>Pro&s;opopea.</HI> This is, in plain English, <HI>imagining</HI> a Per&s;on, and directing our Di&s;cour&s;e to him. He divided it into two Kinds, either ap|plying to a Per&s;on ab&s;ent, or to an ina|nimate Thing, as if it were a living Per&s;on.</P>
<P>This Divi&s;ion is well under&s;tood and very common. Thou&s;ands of In&s;tances, of both Kinds, are to be found in <HI>Ho|mer, Virgil, Ovid, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. Of the fir&s;t Sort there is an In&s;tance near the Beginning of the fir&s;t Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> where <HI>Aeneas</HI> invokes <HI>Tydides,</HI> as if he were pre&s;ent; but it is much &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ed in the Original, than
<PB N="445" REF="454">
in the Tran&s;lation. A noble In&s;tance of the &s;econd Sort is in the fourth Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> where <HI>Satan</HI> addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the <HI>Sun</HI>; and in another Place, where <HI>Eve</HI> talks to the Flowers, Trees, and Brooks, from which &s;he is about to be bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>But our Profe&s;&s;or's chief De&s;ign was to &s;hew that there were more &s;trong, more grand, and more emphatical Fi|gures, of this Kind, in the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures,</HI> than in all the Poets put toge|ther. For In&s;tance, <Q>Hear, O Heaven, and give Ear, O Earth.</Q> <HI>Jeremiah</HI> addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the Sword of the <HI>Lord,</HI> "which," he &s;ays, <Q>thir&s;teth for Blood;</Q> and to his Arrows, which he calls "the Children of his Quiver." He

quoted many more, all very &s;trong and emphatical, and &s;hewed us &s;ome of the fine&s;t <HI>Pro&s;opopea's</HI> mixed with the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive Metaphors, and other Figures. But he in&s;i&s;ted chiefly on a Pa&s;&s;age in the Song of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Si|rak,</HI> where they do not make a <HI>Pro&s;opo|pea</HI> to the Mother of <HI>Si&s;era,</HI> but imagine her talking to her Ladies, and thence &s;o impatient as to an&s;wer her&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Mother of <HI>Si&s;era</HI> looked out at a Window, and cried through the Lattice, <Q>Why is his Cha|riot &s;o long in coming?

ob&s;erved the Impatience of a Mother for the Return of her Son, her looking out at the Lattice, her a&s;king her Ladies, her returning An&s;wer to her&s;elf, and then the Particulars that ran mo&s;t in her Head, not Conque&s;t nor Glory, but captive Dam&s;els, and fine gorgeous Raiment; with an Imagination &s;o warm and full, that &s;he de&s;cribes them as minutely as if &s;he had &s;een them.
