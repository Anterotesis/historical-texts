<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Fawnia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_BEFORE Chri&s;tianity appear|ed in the World, there reign|ed in <HI>Bohemia</HI> a King, named <HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> who was married to a Prince&s;s of exqui&s;ite Beauty and con&s;ummate Virtue, cal|led <HI>Bellaria.</HI> The Harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between this royal Couple gave the greate&s;t Satisfaction to all their Subjects, who&s;e Hap|pine&s;s was greatly increa&s;ed by the Felicity of their Sovereigns.</P>
<P>At the End of the fir&s;t Year of their Mar|riage <HI>Bellaria</HI> was delivered of a Son, who was named <HI>Garrinter.</HI> The <HI>Bohemians</HI> upon
<PB N="2" REF="4">
this Occa&s;ion made great Rejoicings over all the Kingdom. And the King, as well to expre&s;s his own Satisfaction at this happy In|cident, as to comply with the De&s;ires of the People, appointed Ju&s;ts and Tournaments in Honour of the young Prince; to which not only many foreign Noblemen re&s;orted, but al&s;o &s;everal neighbouring Kings and Princes came to exerci&s;e their Valour and Judgment at the&s;e martial Entertainments.</P>
<P>The Sports la&s;ted twenty Days, during which Time the King made a general Fea&s;t for all his Subjects; and the Kings and Prin|ces, who had been royally entertained, re|turned home to their re&s;pective Countries, full of Admiration of the great Magnificence of <HI>Pando&s;to.</HI></P>
<P>The Smiles of Fortune are &s;eldom &s;incere or la&s;ting; the fickle Godde&s;s, weary of be|&s;towing Favours upon <HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> while he was wholly taken up in the Enjoyment of them, prepared a &s;ad rever&s;e of Fate for him and the lovely <HI>Bellaria. Pando&s;to,</HI> from his earlie&s;t Youth, had contracted and maintained a &s;trict Friend&s;hip and Corre&s;pondence with <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> the young King of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince being de&s;irous of &s;hewing that neither Time nor Di&s;tance of Place could weaken the Force of his Affection for <HI>Pan|do&s;to,</HI> re&s;olved to vi&s;it him in his own Domi|nions, to congratulate him upon his Marriage and the Birth of a Son. For this Purpo&s;e he ordered a &s;mall Fleet to be prepared, and with
<PB N="3" REF="5">
a &s;mall but &s;elect Number of Attendants ar|rived in <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to</HI> and his Queen, with a numerous Retinue, went to meet <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> at his landing, and carried him to the Palace in the mid&s;t of mo&s;t expen&s;ive Shows and magnificent Arches, which had been prepared and erected for his Reception.</P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> who&s;e Heart overflowed with grateful Tran&s;port for this Demon&s;tration of Friend&s;hip in <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> intreated his Queen to &s;hew all imaginable Re&s;pect and E&s;teem to a Prince whom he loved &s;o much, and to whom he was &s;o highly obliged.</P>
<P>The &s;weet <HI>Bellaria,</HI> who had no other Will but that of her Hu&s;band, was ea&s;ily pre|vailed upon to comply with a Reque&s;t to which her own Inclinations naturally incited her, for the noble Qualities &s;he ob&s;erved in <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> had al|ready produced &s;uitable Effects in a Mind, that being virtuous and &s;en&s;ible to the highe&s;t Degree it&s;elf, could not chu&s;e but love tho&s;e Perfections in another.</P>
<P><HI>Bellaria</HI> therefore, as well in Obedience to her Hu&s;band's Commands, as in Con&s;equence of the Friend&s;hip &s;he had conceived for <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> gave him every Day a thou&s;and innocent Marks of her E&s;teem, which that Prince, who admired and loved her Perfections with all the Warmth of a di&s;intere&s;ted Friend, did not fail to return with every In&s;tance of Gra|titude and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">This mutual E&s;teem gave ri&s;e to an ea&s;y Confidence and familiar Intercour&s;e between them; &s;o that <HI>Pando&s;to</HI> being often engaged with his Mini&s;ters in Affairs of State, <HI>Bellaria</HI> and <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> pa&s;&s;ed away the Time in his Ab|&s;ence in various Di&s;cour&s;es and innocent A|mu&s;ements, all which at fir&s;t was very plea&s;|ing to <HI>Pando&s;to.</HI></P>
<P>But that unhappy Prince, either becau&s;e he was con&s;cious of the &s;uperior Merit of <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> or through the natural Bent of his Di&s;po&s;ition, began to look with &s;u&s;picious Eyes on a Friend|&s;hip and Familiarity which he had been &s;o &s;oli|citous to form: Doubtful and unea&s;y Thoughts aro&s;e in his Mind, he reflected on the irre&s;&s;i&s;t|able Charms of <HI>Bellaria,</HI> and the manly Beauty and noble Qualities of <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> and thought it impo&s;&s;ible that two Per&s;ons &s;o formed to plea&s;e &s;hould be in&s;en&s;ible to each others Merit.</P>
<P>The&s;e Doubts having entered his Mind, he fed his growing Jealou&s;y with continual Ob|&s;ervations on the Looks and Words of his Friend and Wife; and prejudiced as he now was, their innocent Familiarity appeared to him to be a convincing Proof of their guilty Pa&s;&s;ion; Su&s;picion was now changed to ab&s;o|lute Certainty; he no longer looked upon <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> as his Friend and Gue&s;t, but as the De&s;troyer of his Honour, and the Violater of his Queen.</P>
<P>A violent Hatred &s;ucceeded the tender Af|fection he once bore to <HI>Egi&s;tus;</HI> and tho&s;e Smiles of Love with which he had always
<PB N="5" REF="7">
been accu&s;tomed to behold the charming <HI>Bellaria,</HI> gave Place to &s;ullen Re&s;erve and gloomy Frowns: Racked with the torment|ing Remembrance of his fancied Wrongs, the De&s;ire and Hope of Revenge afforded him &s;ome Intervals of Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved therefore to poi&s;on <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> and while his Mind was labouring how to execute his cruel Purpo&s;e with Security, his Words and Behaviour &s;till wore an Appearance of Friend&s;hip and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to</HI> had a Cup-bearer, named <HI>Franion,</HI> whom, becau&s;e he had always &s;hewn an inviola|ble Attachment to his Per&s;on, he believed it would be ea&s;y to per&s;uade to execute his purpo&s;ed Vengeance on the King of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>To this Man therefore the jealous Mo|narch communicated his ungenerous De&s;ign, and promi&s;ed him a large Reward, if when the next Time that <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> called for Drink at his Table, he would put Poi&s;on in his Cup.</P>
<P><HI>Franion</HI> &s;huddered with Horror at this in|human Propo&s;ition; and with all the Freedom of a good Man and a faithful Subject he en|deavoured to di&s;&s;uade his King from his bar|barous Purpo&s;e. He repre&s;ented to him that Murder was an unpardonable Offence to the Gods, and abhorred by all Mankind, that &s;uch unnatural Crimes not only drew down the Wrath of Heaven upon the Perpetrators of them, but the Revenge of Men. He urged to him the &s;acred Laws of Ho&s;pitality,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
that <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> was his Gue&s;t, his Friend and Ally; that any Cruelty committed upon his Per&s;on would brand his Name with perpetual Infamy, and &s;ow the la&s;ting Seeds of Di&s;cord and Hatred between the <HI>Sicilians</HI> and <HI>Bohemi|ans;</HI> and that even his own Subjects would murmur at &s;uch an unexampled Piece of Cruelty and Treachery.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments had no Force with the determined <HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> who, per&s;i&s;ting &s;till in his cruel Re&s;olution, gave <HI>Franion</HI> his Choice either to poi&s;on <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> and be rewarded with Riches and Honours, or to &s;uffer Death for his Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P><HI>Franion,</HI> &s;taggered by the&s;e dreadful Threat|nings on one Hand, and allured by tho&s;e great Promi&s;es on the other, told <HI>Pando&s;to</HI> that he would obey him, and as &s;oon as a fair Opportunity offered he would poi&s;on <HI>Egi&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>The King was very well plea&s;ed with this Promi&s;e, and re&s;olved as &s;oon as his de&s;igned Vengeance on <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> was executed, to &s;a|crifice <HI>Bellaria</HI> in the &s;ame Manner, to his abu&s;ed Love and injured Honour.</P>
<P>When the King was departed, <HI>Franion</HI> having no longer that dreadful Object before his Eyes, threatening Death and Torments if he did not murder the innocent Prince, be|gan to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon the horrid Deed he had engaged to perform: Murder he thought, however &s;ecretly and &s;ecurely committed, might for a Time avoid Danger, but never wholly e&s;cape Puni&s;hment; that no Balm, no Leni|tive
<PB N="7" REF="9">
could heal the Stings of a wounded Con|&s;cience, and the Guilt of innocent Blood would always be accompanied with Remor&s;e and Horror.</P>
<P>He reflected that, though he was a Subject, his King had no Right to his Obedience when his Commands were contrary to the expre&s;s Will and Plea&s;ure of the Gods, to whom he owed a higher Duty.</P>
<P>He con&s;idered, that the peaceful Calm of a contented Mind in an humble Condition was preferable to the re&s;tle&s;s Turbulence of Dignity and Riches, when purcha&s;ed with Crimes and &s;tained with Blood, and that hone&s;t Poverty was infinitely better than &s;hameful Grandeur.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that he mu&s;t either die with a clear Mind, or live with a foul and &s;potted Con&s;cience; his Soul was &s;o perplexed be|tween the&s;e two Extremes that he could take no Re&s;t; at la&s;t he determined to di&s;cover the Affair to <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> and for that Purpo&s;e he went to his Apartments, and de&s;iring a private Au|dience of the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> he was admitted to his Pre&s;ence, and in a few Words laid open the whole Con&s;piracy again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Brave and Generous are not ea&s;ily in|duced to believe tho&s;e they love are capable of Ba&s;ene&s;s and Ingratitude. <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> judging of <HI>Pando&s;to</HI>'s Heart by the Rectitude of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s own, told <HI>Franion</HI> with a &s;evere Countenance, that he would not entertain a Thought to the Prejudice of the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI>'s Honour.</P>
<P><HI>"Pando&s;to,</HI> continued he, is my Friend and Ally, no Su&s;picion has ever yet interrupt|ed
<PB N="8" REF="10">
our mutual Affection, I did not come here to invade his Territories, to &s;educe his Sub|jects from their Allegiance, or to con&s;pire with his Enemies. Since therefore I have given him no Cau&s;e to &s;eek my Death, I can|not believe him guilty of &s;o unju&s;t and trea|cherous a De&s;ign; but rather &s;u&s;pect the In|formation you have given me to be the Ef|fect of a Combination among the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> to create a Variance between me and their King."</P>
<P><HI>Franion</HI> replied, "that it was dangerous to dally with the Rage of an incen&s;ed and &s;ecret Enemy; that if the <HI>Bohemians</HI> had intended any Harm to him they might ea&s;ily accompli&s;h it without revealing their Con&s;piracy; that it was unkind therefore in his Maje&s;ty to mi&s;|con&s;true his Zeal for his Pre&s;ervation into a treacherous De&s;ign, for that his Intention was to prevent Trea&s;on, not to become a Traitor."</P>
<P>He urged him then to fly with Speed in|to <HI>Sicily</HI> if he hoped to e&s;cape the Danger which threatned him, and begged his Maje&s;ty would permit him to go along with him, when if he did not fully prove that <HI>Pando&s;to</HI> had de|&s;igned to poi&s;on him, he de&s;ired that his ima|gined Treachery might be puni&s;hed with the mo&s;t cruel Torments.</P>
<P><HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> weighing the Matter thoroughly in his Mind, gave many Thanks to <HI>Franion,</HI> and promi&s;ing if he arrived &s;afe in <HI>Sicily</HI> to re|ward him royally; he de&s;ired him to contrive the Method of their E&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"><HI>Franion</HI> went immediately to con&s;ult with the Admiral of <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI>'s Fleet, and it was agreed between them, that it &s;hould be put in Readine&s;s to &s;ail as &s;oon as a fair Wind and Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>Franion</HI> amu&s;ed <HI>Pando&s;to</HI> with Hopes of &s;oon having his &s;o much de|&s;ired Revenge accompli&s;hed, telling him that he was employed in preparing and compound|ing &s;o &s;ubtle a Poi&s;on, that the Moment it was &s;wallowed would procure immediate Death.</P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to</HI> received this News with a malignant Joy, every Hour &s;eeming an Age to his im|patient Fury till His Revenge was &s;atiated with the Death of tho&s;e who had offended him.</P>
<P><HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> being informed that a favourable Gale had &s;prung up, conveyed him&s;elf and his <HI>Sicilians,</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Franion,</HI> out of a Po&s;tern Gate of the City, with &s;uch Secre&s;y and Expedition, that they got on board their Ships without the lea&s;t Su&s;picion, and &s;pread|ing all their Sails to the Wind &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Pando&s;to</HI> was informed that <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> had fled away in the Night, and that <HI>Franion</HI> was gone with him, he let loo&s;e all his Rage upon his Queen, whom he accu&s;ed of con&s;piring with <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> and the Traitor <HI>Franion,</HI> and commanded &s;he &s;hould be led to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> were all alarmed, and &s;u&s;|pected &s;ome Trea&s;on; and the furious <HI>Pando&s;to</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
believing the Queen not only guilty of di&s;ho|nouring his Bed, but of projecting the Flight of <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> &s;ent his Guards with Orders to &s;eize her.</P>
<P>The innocent <HI>Bellaria</HI> not expecting the impending Storm, was playing with her lit|tle Son <HI>Garrinter,</HI> when the Guards, with much Reluctance, came to execute the King's Demands.</P>
<P>The Queen was at fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed and turned pale, but recollecting her&s;elf, and a&s;|&s;uming all the noble Pride of con&s;cious Inno|cence and affronted Virtue, &s;he gave her Hand to the Captain of the Guard, and without murmuring, &s;uffered him to lead her to her Pri&s;on, where &s;he &s;pent the Time in patient Sorrow and ab&s;olute Re&s;ignation.</P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> mad with the Di&s;appointment of his Revenge upon <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> re&s;olved it &s;hould fall doubly heavy on the Head of the injured <HI>Bellaria,</HI> he therefore cau&s;ed it to be proclaim|ed throughout all his Dominions, that the Queen had committed Adultery with <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> and with his Cup-bearer, <HI>Franion,</HI> had con&s;pir|ed his Death.</P>
<P>Though the Queen's Life had hitherto ap|peared blamele&s;s, yet this confident Proclama|tion, and the Flight of the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Franion,</HI> rai&s;ed many Su&s;picions again&s;t her in the Minds of the People, who notwith&s;tand|ing daily offered up Prayers for her Deli|verance.</P>
<P>Her Youth, her Beauty, the Sweetne&s;s of her Manners, but above all her Misfortunes, excited every one's Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">But the cruel <HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> in who&s;e rocky Bo&s;om Pity could find no Acce&s;s, re&s;olved to load the unfortunate <HI>Bellaria</HI> with every Kind of Infamy and Hard&s;hip; he would not allow her to be treated in the Pri&s;on with the Re&s;pect due to the Rank &s;he once held, but cau&s;ed her to be &s;erved and attended with the mo&s;t cruel Neglect.</P>
<P>The Cruelties he exerci&s;ed on the Queen did but in Part &s;atisfy his Revenge, he longed to make <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> feel the Weight of his Fury: But this Monarch was &s;o powerful by his Al|lies, having married the Emperor of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s Daughter, that he de&s;paired of ever being able by open Force to accompli&s;h his Re|venge.</P>
<P>The unhappy Queen being informed of the vile Accu&s;ation again&s;t her &s;o openly proclaimed, con&s;cious of her own &s;potle&s;s In|nocence, and the Integrity of <HI>Egi&s;tus,</HI> earne&s;t|ly intreated that &s;he might be brought to a public Trial, confronted with her Accu&s;er, and allowed to an&s;wer for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the King was &s;o inflamed with Rage and Jealou&s;y that he would not receive her Petition; and while the poor Queen was thus langui&s;hing under the Weight of her Calami|ties, and hopele&s;s of Redre&s;s, &s;he perceived her&s;elf to be quick with Child.</P>
<P>So affecting an Incident in her melancholy Condition drew Complaints from her, which &s;oftening the rugged Temper of her Keeper;
<PB N="12" REF="14">
he cau&s;ed the King to be immediately inform|ed of it, not doubting but the News would induce him to &s;et her at Liberty.</P>
<P>The Queen's Pregnancy however produced quite a contrary Effect; for the King no &s;ooner heard of it than &s;tarting up in a violent Fury, he &s;wore <HI>Bellaria</HI> and her Ba&s;tard &s;hould die, even though the Gods them&s;elves &s;hould &s;ay no.</P>
<P>The Queen, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many cruel Afflictions, was happily delivered of a Daughter; and <HI>Pando&s;to</HI> immediately declar|ed his Re&s;olution to have both the Mother and Child burnt.</P>
<P>The Noblemen of his Court u&s;ed all the Arguments their Rea&s;on and Humanity could furni&s;h them with, to prevail upon him to change his barbarous Purpo&s;e, but all they could do was to prevent the Murder of the Child.</P>
<P>The Queen's Doom he told them was ir|revocably fixed, but though at the earne&s;t So|licitations of his Nobles, he promi&s;ed the Child &s;hould not be put to Death, yet the Re&s;olution he took concerning it was little le&s;s cruel, &s;ince by it he only meant to protract its Fat&eacute;.</P>
<P>He &s;ent a Per&s;on to the Pri&s;on with Orders to take the Infant from its wretched Mother, and putting it into a Boat and launching it into the Sea, leave it to the Mercy of the Wind and Waves.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">The Guards who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this barbarous Deed, moved by the &s;weet Countenance of the innocent Babe, could not help accu&s;ing the King of great Cruelty; neverthele&s;s Fear of his Re&s;entment obliged them to execute his Commands.</P>
<P>They put the Child into a Boat, covering it with Boughs to pre&s;erve it from the Incle|mency of the Weather, and &s;et it into the Ocean, when immediately &s;o great a Storm aro&s;e, that it was with much Difficulty they got to &s;hore again.</P>
<P>This horrid Deed accompli&s;hed, the King a&s;&s;embled his Nobles and Coun&s;ellors, and <HI>Bellaria</HI> was brought into Court, where &s;he heard the Charge again&s;t her read.</P>
<P>The Queen, who &s;aw nothing but her Death would &s;atisfy the incen&s;ed King, con|fiding in her own Innocence, a&s;&s;umed all the Courage her unhappy Condition required, and with a noble Haughtine&s;s demanded to have Law and Ju&s;tice; "for Mercy, &s;aid &s;he, I do not expect; let my Accu&s;ers therefore appear in Court, and give their Evidences be|fore my Face."</P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to</HI> replied, "that the Witne&s;&s;es were of &s;uch Credit that their Words alone were &s;ufficient; that for her, indeed it was her Part to deny &s;uch a mon&s;trous Crime, and for&s;wear her&s;elf, &s;eeing that &s;he had overcome all Sen&s;e of Shame and Remor&s;e in committing it; ne|verthele&s;s,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
added he, you &s;hall die, and die a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious Death."</P>
<P>The Queen, not terrified by the&s;e Threats, replied without any Emotion, "that to pro|ceed to Puni&s;hment without Proof, was Ri|gour, not Law."</P>
<P>The Nobles approved of what &s;he &s;aid, and required that her Accu&s;ers &s;hould be &s;worn and openly examined; and if the Queen's Guilt was fully proved, his Maje&s;ty might condemn her to &s;uffer the Puni&s;hment ordain|ed by the Law for &s;uch Offences.</P>
<P>The King an&s;wered, "that in this Ca&s;e he could and would di&s;pen&s;e with the Law, and that the Nobles &s;hould take his Word for &s;uf|ficient Evidence, otherwi&s;e he would make the proude&s;t of them repent it.</P>
<P>This Threat &s;truck them all dumb, but <HI>Bellaria,</HI> who de&s;paired of Life, and dreaded Infamy more than Death, &s;aid, "if his Will mu&s;t be the Law, the Jury's Verdict will be u&s;ele&s;s: Then falling on her Knees, &s;he conjured the King by the Love he bore to the young Prince <HI>Garrinter</HI> his Son, that he would grant her one Reque&s;t, which was to &s;end &s;ix of his Nobles, in whom he placed the greate&s;t Confidence, to the I&s;land of <HI>Delphos,</HI> and there con&s;ult the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> con|cerning the Crimes &s;he was accu&s;ed of."</P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to</HI> could not refu&s;e &s;o rea&s;onable a Reque&s;t, and having named &s;ix Emba&s;&s;adors to be di&s;patched with all Speed to <HI>Delphos,</HI> he

<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors performed their Voyage in three Weeks, and as &s;oon as they landed at <HI>Delphos,</HI> they went to the Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and with great Devotion offered Sacrifices to the God, and Gifts to his Prie&s;ts, according to Cu&s;tom, and then humbly be&s;ought an An&s;wer to their Demands.</P>
<P>They had not kneeled long at the Altar, when <HI>Apollo</HI> with a loud Vice &s;aid, <HI>"Bohemi|ans,</HI> what you find behind the Altar take and depart;" they obeyed the Oracle, and found a Scroll of Parchment, which the Prie&s;t com|manded them not to open but in the Pre&s;ence of the King.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors a&s;&s;ured him of their ex|act Obedience to his Injunctions, and their Devotions being fini&s;hed they left the Tem|ple, and &s;ailed with a fair Wind for <HI>Bohemia,</HI> where they &s;oon arrived, and ha&s;tened to Court.</P>
<P><HI>Pando&s;to</HI> received them very graciou&s;ly, and they after giving him an Account of their Voyage, pre&s;ented the divine Scroll to him, intreating him at the &s;ame Time, &s;ince the Queen's Life or Death, her Innocence or Guilt, was contained in that &s;acred Writing, that he would &s;ummon the Nobility to meet in the Judgment Hall, and before them and the accu&s;ed Queen cau&s;e the Oracle to be read.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">The King approved of their Advice, and on the Day appointed the King and the No|bles being all a&s;&s;embled in the Court, the Queen was brought to the Bar, and thus &s;poke.</P>
<P>"How I have led my Life before <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> came into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> I appeal, <HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> to thy Con&s;cience, and to the immortal Gods; they only know whether I am guilty of the Crimes whereof I am accu&s;ed; for me, I here prote&s;t my Innocence, and for the Truth of what I &s;ay, I refer my&s;elf to the divine Oracle.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Bellaria</HI> being &s;ilent, the King com|manded one of his Nobles to open the Scroll, which he did, and read aloud the following Words, which were written in Letters of Gold.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The ORACLE.</HEAD>
<P>"Su&s;picion is no Proof; Jealou&s;y is a par|tial Judge; <HI>Bellaria</HI> is cha&s;te, <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> blame|le&s;s, <HI>Franion</HI> a true Subject; <HI>Pando&s;to</HI> trea|cherous; his Babe innocent, and the King &s;hall die without an Heir, if that which is lo&s;t be not found."</P>
<P>After the Oracle was read the Court re|&s;ounded with joyful Acclamations; the Queen's Innocence thus manife&s;ted, filled every Heart with Tran&s;port.</P>
<P>The King beginning now to be a&s;hamed of his ra&s;h Jealou&s;y and unju&s;t Su&s;picions, not
<PB N="17" REF="19">
daring to approach the wronged <HI>Bellaria,</HI> de&s;ir|ed his Nobles to implore her to forgive the In|juries he had offered her; and &s;tung with Re|mor&s;e and Horror at his pa&s;t Actions, he pub|lickly confe&s;&s;ed his De&s;ign again&s;t the Life of <HI>Egi&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>While he was thus laying open his own Treachery, a Me&s;&s;enger came ha&s;tily into the Court, and informed the King that the Prince <HI>Garrinter</HI> was dead.</P>
<P><HI>Bellaria,</HI> who&s;e Soul had been overwhelm|ed with Joy by the divine Oracle, which had declared her Innocence, was &s;eized with &s;uch an Exce&s;s of Sorrow at the&s;e dreadful Tidings, that her tender Heart, not able to &s;upport the Force of the&s;e contrary Extreams, bur&s;t with the mighty Weight, and &s;inking down &s;he expired in a Moment.</P>
<P>The King became &s;en&s;ele&s;s at this dreadful Sight, and being carried to the Palace, not|with&s;tanding all the Endeavours of the Phy&s;ici|ans he lay &s;peechle&s;s three Days.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> were in the utmo&s;t De&s;pair, nothing but Mourning and Complaints were to be &s;een and heard; the Death of the Queen and Prince, and the extream Danger the King was in, filled the whole City with Grief and Con&s;ternation; at length he recovered his Sen&s;es and his Speech, and this News in &s;ome Mea&s;ure revived the drooping <HI>Bohemians.</HI></P>
<P>But the King's De&s;pair was &s;o violent that he attempted to murder him&s;elf, and was with
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Difficulty prevented by his Nobles, who u&s;ed all the Arguments they could think of to calm his Mind and per&s;wade him to bear his Mi&s;|fortunes patiently.</P>
<P>Their dutiful Cares at la&s;t &s;ucceeded, the King grew more patient and re&s;igned, and gave Orders for the Interment of his Queen and Son, which was performed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;plendid Manner.</P>
<P>Once in every Day he went to <HI>Bellaria</HI>'s Tomb, and with Tears of Penitence and Sorrow lamented her unhappy Fate, and his own Misfortunes.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t leave this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prince for a while, to relate what befell the Royal In|fant whom we left floating on the Ocean.</P>
<P>The Boat in which it was laid being to&s;t for two Days with the Wind and Sea, and every Moment ready to peri&s;h in the Waves; it plea&s;ed the Gods to direct it at la&s;t to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sicily,</HI> where it was drove on Shore.</P>
<P>It fortunately happened that a Shepherd who had mi&s;&s;ed one of his Sheep, not finding it in any of the Covers hard by, came to the Sea-&s;ide in Hopes it was there brow&s;ing on the Sea-Ivy, and hearing the Voice of a Child, which he at fir&s;t mi&s;took for the Bleating of a Sheep, went to the Sands and &s;aw a Boat driven on Ground; he immediately waded to|wards it, and di&s;covered a mo&s;t beautiful Babe lying at the Bottom, wrapt in a Scarlet
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Mantle embroidered with Gold, and a Chain of rich Jewels about its Neck.</P>
<P>The Shepherd, a&s;toni&s;hed at this Adventure, beholding the Beauty of the Infant, and the Riches that were about it, began to think it was &s;ome little Divinity, and was going to adore it; when the weak Cries of the Child, who &s;eemed to be ju&s;t peri&s;hing with Cold and Hunger, per&s;uaded him it was a meer Mortal.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ion took the Place of Reverence; he approached the Child, took it into his Arms, and &s;uppo&s;ing by the extraordinary Magnificence of its Dre&s;s that it was of noble Birth, he re&s;olved to carry it to the King.</P>
<P>As he was wrapping the Mantle clo&s;e about it to pre&s;erve it better from the Cold, a Bag of Money fell from it at his Feet; which he take|ing up, was &s;o captivated with the Sight, that changing his De&s;ign he determined to breed up the Infant him&s;elf, and apply the Money to his own U&s;e; then returned a bye Way to his Cottage le&s;t any one &s;hould per|ceive what he carried in his Arms.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he entered the Door the Child began to cry; which alarming his Wife, who &s;uppo&s;ed he was bringing home a Ba&s;tard to nur&s;e, &s;he rated him very &s;everely for his In|fidelity.</P>
<P>The Shepherd begged her to be pacified, and told her if &s;he would be &s;ecret and cauti|ous their Fortunes were made for ever; then
<PB N="20" REF="22">
putting the Child in her Arms he produced the Gold and Jewels he found with it, which &s;o plea&s;ed the poor Woman that &s;he re&s;olved to nur&s;e the Child carefully, and make their Neighbours believe it was their own.</P>
<P>The Gold and Jewels they concealed, and the Shepherd returned to the Care of his Flocks, while his Wife employed her&s;elf in nur&s;ing the Foundling, to whom they gave the Name of <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>
<P>In a few Years after the Shepherd purcha&s;|ed a good Farm, and from tending the Flocks of other People became Ma&s;ter of a con&s;i|derable one him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fawnia</HI> arrived at the Age of ten Years, <HI>Porrus</HI> and <HI>Mop&s;a,</HI> for &s;o her &s;uppo&s;ed Father and Mother were called, committed the Care of their Flocks; to her, and the young Shepherde&s;s, who&s;e Beauty at tho&s;e early Years was the A&s;toni&s;hment and Admiration of all that beheld her, applied her&s;elf with the ut|mo&s;t Diligence to her pa&s;toral Employment, &s;o that every Thing pro&s;pered under her Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> now purcha&s;ed Land, which he de|&s;igned to leave <HI>Fawnia</HI> at his Death; and &s;he growing to fifteen Years old, many of the rich Farmer's Sons made their Addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>The fair Shepherde&s;s was not the only Ad|miration and Wonder of the Country, her Wit and Judgment was equal to her Beauty, and
<PB N="21" REF="23">
tho&s;e uncommon Charms of Mind and Per|&s;on made her even be talked of at Court.</P>
<P>She who believed her&s;elf to be the Daugh|ter of <HI>Porrus,</HI> was not elated with the Prai&s;es that were be&s;towed on her, but with a &s;weet Humility conformed to the Lowline&s;s of her Condition, and tended her Flocks with the utmo&s;t Diligence and Care.</P>
<P>Though &s;he was not vain of the Graces of her Per&s;on, yet her rural Habit was always exactly neat, her lovely Hair was bound up with a graceful Negligence, and &s;he took Care to choo&s;e the fre&s;he&s;t and mo&s;t becoming Flowers to compo&s;e the Garland which &s;haded her charming Face from the Sun.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sicily</HI> had only one Son, named <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> a beautiful and accompli&s;h|ed Youth, of whom the <HI>Sicilians</HI> had great Hopes.</P>
<P>The King, de&s;irous of &s;eeing him married before he died, &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> to demand the Prince&s;s <HI>Euphania</HI> his Daughter, and the Heir to his Dominions, in Marriage for the Prince of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> agreeing to the Propo&s;al, <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> acquainted his Son with the Treaty he had entered into; he enlarged on the Beauty and Virtues of the Prince&s;s <HI>Euphania,</HI> on the Advantages of an Alliance with the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and concluded with prai&s;ing the Gods for the happy Succe&s;s of his Negociation.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"><HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> heard all this with &s;uch apparent Indifference that the King was amazed, and a&s;ked him if he had any Objection to the Match?</P>
<P>The Prince an&s;wered coldly, "That his Heart was yet a Stranger to Love, that all Women were indifferent to him, and that Marriage was an Engagement he had no In|clination to enter into."</P>
<P>The King, extremely offended with this Reply, threatened him with the &s;evere&s;t Effects of his Di&s;plea&s;ure if he did not endeavour to conform to his Will; and finding the Prince continued in a &s;ullen Silence, and would give him no Satisfaction, he quitted him in great Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> was &s;en&s;ibly afflicted at his Fa|ther's Anger, and ardently wi&s;hed he could conquer that Repugnance he felt in his Soul to Marriage, that he might not offend him by an ab&s;olute Refu&s;al; but the more he &s;truggled to overcome that Di&s;like which forced him to &s;eem di&s;obedient to his Father, the deeper he found it rooted in his Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;hort Time after this Di&s;cour&s;e had pa&s;|&s;ed between the King and the Prince, there happened to be a Meeting of all the Shep|herds Daughters in <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> was cho&s;en Queen for the Day, and dre&s;t in her be&s;t Cloaths pre&s;ided over their rural Sports; the Day being pa&s;t in &s;uch innocent Diver&s;ions as Shepherde&s;&s;es, when
<PB N="23" REF="25">
Evening approached they &s;eparated, and <HI>Fawnia</HI> de&s;iring a neighbouring Sheperde&s;s to go with her to &s;ee if her Flock was folded, <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> who was returning from Hawk|ing, met the two Virgins as they were going home, and &s;truck with Admiration at the Beauty of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> he &s;topt and a&s;ked her &s;e|veral trifling Que&s;tions, in order to have an Opportunity of gazing on her.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> a&s;wered him with &s;o much &s;prightly Wit and &s;o graceful an Air, that the Prince already half vanqui&s;hed by the Charms of her Per&s;on, was wholly &s;ubdued by tho&s;e of her Mind. Love, offended at the former Ob&s;ti|nacy of this young Rebel, re&s;olved now to make him feel the utmo&s;t Effects of his Power, and with the keene&s;t Arrow in his Quiver, pierced that once in&s;en&s;ible Heart.</P>
<P>The Prince &s;ighed with Pain and Plea&s;ure; he could not remove his Eyes from the lovely Face of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> which was all over&s;pread with a ro&s;y Blu&s;h; he &s;aw her Confu&s;ion, and a&s;hamed of his own Weakne&s;s he re&s;olved to force him&s;elf away, and clapping Spurs to his Hor&s;e he ha&s;tily bid the Shepherde&s;&s;es farewel, and rode home to the Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia,</HI> who had &s;urveyed the Prince with a curious Eye, began as &s;oon as he was gone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o prai&s;e him to her Companion; &s;he admired his Youth, his Beauty, his &s;weet Affability: The plea&s;ing Theme tran&s;ported her beyond her u&s;ual Moderation, her Thoughts were
<PB N="24" REF="26">
full of the Prince's Perfections, &s;he could not find Words &s;ufficient to expre&s;s her Admira|tion; &s;he perceived at length, and blu&s;hed at, her Indi&s;cretion, and remained &s;ilent and com|po&s;ed during the re&s;t of their Walk.</P>
<P>She took Leave of her Companion at the Door of her Cottage, and retired to Bed full of a plea&s;ing Anxiety for which her inexperi|enced Innocence could not yet find a Name.</P>
<P>The Prince, who&s;e Mind was &s;till more re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y than <HI>Fawnia</HI>'s, becau&s;e he better under&s;tood the nature of his Di&s;temper, pa&s;&s;ed the Night in various and tormenting Thoughts: Fain would he have bani&s;hed the &s;weet Image of <HI>Fawnia</HI> from his Remem|brance, but Love had engraved it too deeply in his Heart, and finding his Endeavours to for|get her fruitle&s;s, he &s;ought to excu&s;e and ju&s;tify his Pa&s;&s;ion, by reflecting on the inevitable Charms of her that cau&s;ed it.</P>
<P>"Oh, cruel! oh, injurious Fortune! cried he, tran&s;ported with the bright Idea, to hide &s;uch Perfection in a Cottage, and lavi&s;h Crowns and Scepters often on Deformity."</P>
<P>"Oh! <HI>Fawnia,</HI> was that inchanting Form made only to grace the Fields? were the&s;e bright Eyes ordained to &s;hine in humble Vales, and only ble&s;s rude Swains with their Love darting Beams? was that &s;prightly Wit and tho&s;e native Graces of thy Mind given thee to be for ever clouded in a Cottage?"</P>
<P>"Ah! no, it cannot be, the Gods are ju&s;t and equal in their Di&s;pen&s;ations, and though they did not make you born a Prince&s;s, they did more, and made you de&s;erving to be one;
<PB N="25" REF="27">
I am their In&s;trument to rai&s;e you to the Rank for which Nature de&s;igned you, and which no other can &s;o worthily fill.</P>
<P>The amorous Prince pau&s;ed at the&s;e Words, then &s;uddenly giving Way to new Reflexions, "How would it plea&s;e my Father, cried he, to know that my Heart is capable of Love? oh! divine Law, feared by all Men, becau&s;e honoured by the Gods them&s;elves."</P>
<P>"But alas! <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> added he, breathing a deep and dreadful Sigh, who is it that is the Object of thy Pa&s;&s;ion? a rural Maid, the Daughter of a &s;imple Shepherd. Does this Match &s;uit with the Dignity of thy Birth? thou who art the Son of a King, and Heir to a powerful Kingdom. Ah! let me rather die than poorly &s;ubmit to &s;uch a &s;hameful Weak|ne&s;s; for 'tis better to peri&s;h nobly than to live with Contempt."</P>
<P>The wavering Prince, re&s;ting a while upon this thought, endeavoured to collect his whole Force of Rea&s;on to &s;upport a Re&s;olution which &s;eemed worthy of him&s;elf; but Love, who laughed at all his vain Attempts to elude his Power, again impre&s;t the lovely Image of <HI>Fawnia</HI> upon his Fancy.</P>
<P>"Oh! Beauty, &s;aid the &s;ighing Prince, how ab&s;olute is thy Empire over the Heart! &s;weet and imperious Tyrant thou &s;halt be obeyed, I yield to thy irre&s;i&s;table Force; yes <HI>Fawnia,</HI> lovely and adorable <HI>Fawnia,</HI> thou &s;halt be mine, thy humble Birth &s;hall be no Ob&s;tacle to my De&s;ires."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">"The Gods them&s;elves have not di&s;dained to love; <HI>Jupiter</HI> was enamoured of <HI>Dana&euml;,</HI> and the bright <HI>Apollo</HI> woed the inexorable <HI>Daphne;</HI> the&s;e were mortal Beauties, and they were Deities; why then, though a Prince, may not I love a Shepherde&s;s? but their Pa&s;|&s;ions were di&s;honourable, mine is pure and cha&s;te, 'tis true, and herein I &s;urpa&s;s the Gods: Be &s;till then, oh my Soul, for 'tis decreed <HI>Fawnia,</HI> the adorable <HI>Fawnia</HI> &s;hall be mine."</P>
<P>The Prince having thus taken his Re&s;olu|tion, his Mind grew ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, but it was far otherwi&s;e with the charming Shep|herde&s;s, &s;trange and unu&s;ual Dreams perplex|ed her roving Fancy the whole Night.</P>
<P>That homely Couch, which before had only &s;upplied calm and unrufled Slumbers, and chearful Dreams of plea&s;ant Labour and in|nocent Amu&s;ements pa&s;t, now gave Birth to anxious Wi&s;hes, delu&s;ive Hopes, and unea&s;y Repinings.</P>
<P>She awaked, but not as u&s;ual refre&s;hed with her Repo&s;e; her renewed Spirits &s;parkling in her chearful Eyes, and eager to begin the rural Labours of the Day, but heavy, langui&s;hing, and full of unea&s;y Perturbations, &s;he ro&s;e be|fore her wonted Hour, and thinking to bani&s;h the various Thoughts which tormented her by indu&s;trious Toils; &s;he drove her Flocks to the Field, &s;hifted the Folds, and doubled her Morning's Work; at la&s;t fatigued and breathle&s;s &s;he &s;at down at the Foot of a Tree, and thus began to accu&s;e the Folly and Pre|&s;umption of her new Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

mean E&s;tate, and the apparent Impo&s;&s;ibility of ever accompli&s;hing her Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mean Time <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> con&s;umed away with impatient De&s;ire, his former Plea&s;ures now grew ta&s;tele&s;s to his Sen&s;e, Company was tedious, Mu&s;ic only &s;oothed his &s;weet Di&s;order, and added Fewel to his Fires.</P>
<P>Weary at length of the intolerable Re&s;traint his Pride had forced him to lay upon his Wi&s;hes, he re&s;olved to &s;atisfy his longing Eyes with another Sight of the &s;weet, but dangerous <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e he &s;tole &s;ecretly out of the Palace, and without any Attendants took his Way to the Fields where he had fir&s;t &s;een the beauteous Shepherde&s;s <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>
<P>There he walked &s;ome Time without meet|ing with the Object his pa&s;&s;ionate Eyes were every where in Search of.

<P>The pa&s;&s;ionate Prince &s;tood at a little Di&s;|tance for &s;ome Moments, contemplating her with an Exce&s;s of Wonder and Delight, when <HI>Fawnia</HI> happening to look up, &s;he met

his ardent Gaze, and this &s;udden and unexpected Sight gave her &s;o much Emotion, that her fair Face was in an In&s;tant dyed with a ro&s;y Blu&s;h.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e however from her Seat and curt'&s;ied to the Prince, but with &s;uch native Ele|gance and Grace, that <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> who could not conceive how a Country Maid bred up in the Fields and Woods could have &s;o much Politene&s;s in her Manner, was lo&s;t in A&s;to|ni&s;hment and Admiration.</P>
<P>"Fair Virgin, &s;aid he approaching her, either your Poverty is great, or the Life of a Shepher|de&s;s is very &s;weet, that you can take &s;uch De|light in rural Labours, is it becau&s;e you are &s;o like a Nymph that you re&s;olve to imitate the Nymphs, and wa&s;te your Days in Woods and Lawns?

<P><PB N="31" REF="33">"Ah! <HI>Fawnia,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> with a Sigh he could not &s;uppre&s;s, I gue&s;s the Cau&s;e of your Fondne&s;s for a rural Life, you love a Country Shepherd."</P>
<P>"Sir, replied <HI>Fawnia,</HI> &s;miling, pardon me if I tell you, you have not gue&s;&s;ed right: Shep|herds! alas, they cannot love they are &s;o &s;im|ple, and Maids mu&s;t not if they are no older than I am."</P>
<P>"In my Opinion, pretty one, &s;aid the Prince, Maids ought to love becau&s;e they are young, Cupid is a Child, and the Godde&s;s of Love is painted young?"</P>
<P>"Age may indeed be painted with fal&s;e Colours, &s;aid <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and Youth may have Actions too forward but what Art too little conceals in one, Ignorance reveals in the other."</P>
<P><HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> who thought this Conver&s;ation the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of any he ever had, would have perhaps drawn it out to a con&s;ide|rable Length, but perceiving &s;ome of his At|tendants approaching, he was willing to know a little more of her Heart before he parted from her.</P>
<P>"Perhaps, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> &s;aid he, taking her Hand, I love thee; if &s;o you mu&s;t needs yield me your Heart, for I am a Prince you know, and may command you."</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">"I acknowledge your Power, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Fawnia,</HI> in all ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Things, but with Submi&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t &s;ay my Heart is only at my own Di&s;po&s;al; con&s;trained Love is Force, and Force you have no Right to u&s;e over me: and believe me, it is not a vain Bea&s;t I make, when I tell you that poor as I am I &s;et &s;o great a Value upon my Cha&s;tity, that I would rather die than be the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the greate&s;t King upon Earth, and my Birth is &s;o mean and groveling that I am not fit to be a Farmer's Wife."</P>
<P>The lovely Shepherde&s;s ended the&s;e Words with a Sigh, which e&s;caped her unawares.</P>
<P>The Prince, after a little Pau&s;e, replied, "It &s;eems then, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> that you cannot love <HI>Dora&s;tus."</HI></P>
<P>"Yes, &s;aid <HI>Fawnia</HI> precipitately, when <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> becomes a Shepherd."</P>
<P>The Prince's Attendants being now come near, he ha&s;tily went to meet them, leaving <HI>Fawnia</HI> alone and pen&s;ive, her Imagination filled with a thou&s;and new Ideas.</P>
<P>She &s;eated her&s;elf again at the Foot of the Hill, revolving in her Mind all the Prince had &s;aid to her, and this &s;econd View of him, to|gether with the Affability of his Behaviour, and &s;ome flattering Hopes &s;he began to enter|tain, entirely compleated the Conque&s;t of her Heart.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Moments &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf up to the mo&s;t &s;oothing Reflexions, but when the Lowne&s;s of her Condition ru&s;hed upon her
<PB N="33" REF="35">
Thoughts, and broke the &s;weet Delu&s;ion &s;he was &s;o fond of, then &s;he began to blame the Extravagance of her Wi&s;hes, and tried to re|collect her &s;cattered Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"Ah! <HI>Fawnia,</HI> whi&s;pered &s;he, why do&s;t thou gaze at the Sun and gra&s;p at Wind? Stars are to be beheld at a Di&s;tance, not aimed to be touched with the Hand; Hopes are to be mea&s;ured by Fortune, not impelled by De&s;ire, and Falls come by climbing high, not by &s;it|ting low. But what then? added &s;he after a little Pau&s;e, mu&s;t all fall who endeavour to ri&s;e becau&s;e &s;ome do? no, Happine&s;s comes by Chance, and Fortune winds tho&s;e Threads which the De&s;tinies &s;pin. Alas! what &s;trange Perplexity am I in, favoured by a Prince, yet obliged through Prudence to reject that Fa|vour, Denial in my Words, and De&s;ire at the bottom of my Heart; I love <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> yet I &s;eem di&s;plea&s;ed with his Court&s;hip. Ah! 'tis our Sex's Fault to fly from tho&s;e we eagerly wi&s;h to meet. But take Heed, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> &s;aid &s;he &s;ighing, for if the Prince is repul&s;ed by thy Shyne&s;s, thou wilt &s;everely repent; for un|le&s;s he loves thou mu&s;t die. Ah! die then, &s;imple Maid, for <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> only je&s;ts with thee, <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> cannot &s;toop to love a Shep|herde&s;s; &s;it down then in thy Sorrow, and pine in &s;ecret. Ah me! how am I changed? I was wont to pa&s;s away my Days in chearful Songs, now I wa&s;te them in Sighs and Com|plaints."</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">While <HI>Fawnia</HI> was thus giving Vent to the tender Anxieties of her Soul, the Approach of Night put her in Mind that it was Time to put her Sheep in the Fold, which having done with a heavy Heart, &s;he ha&s;tened to her poor Cottage.</P>
<P>While Love made this Havock in the inno|cent Brea&s;t of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> he raged with &s;uch Violence in the Heart of the pa&s;&s;ionate Prince, in which the Pride of royal Birth maintained an unequal Conflict, that &s;inking under the Force of tho&s;e contrary Pa&s;&s;ions, he became a Prey to Melancholy and De&s;pair; he loathed his Food, Sleep fled from his Eyes, he grew pale and wan, and fell into a langui&s;hing Di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The King, amazed at the Alteration in his Son, and trembling for his Life, ordered the Attendance of the able&s;t Phy&s;icians in his Kingdom; but their Art was all in vain.</P>
<P>The Prince him&s;elf grew apprehen&s;ive of the Danger he was in, he found he could not live without <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and thought it great Folly to die for what it was in his Power to obtain; Honour long oppo&s;ed the Gratificati|on of his De&s;ires, but Love, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Love, at Length prevailed.</P>
<P>The Prince, wholly abandoning him&s;elf to the Power of this &s;weet Tyrant, procured a Shepherd's Habit and a Crook, and making them to be conveyed to a &s;ecret Place, he
<PB N="35" REF="37">
went privately out of the Palace, and attiring him&s;elf in tho&s;e rural Weeds, took his Way to the Place where his charming Shepherde&s;s fed her Flocks.</P>
<P>As he went along &s;ome unea&s;y Reflexions aro&s;e in his Mind when he &s;urveyed his homely Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Ah! <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> &s;aid he to him&s;elf, what a &s;trange Alteration is here, a Prince transform|ed to a Pea&s;ant! does this wild Folly &s;uit with the Dignity of thy Birth? but indeed thy Habit &s;uits well with thy groveling Thoughts; this is thy proper Dre&s;s, thou wert always di&s;|gui&s;ed before. Oh! Gods, for what Crime am I a&s;&s;igned this Penance? Oh! Love, what a fond Ideot ha&s;t thou made of me?"</P>
<P>"Yet why &s;hould I blu&s;h at this Di&s;gui&s;e? have not the heavenly Deities de&s;cended to Earth, and changed their glorious Forms for Love? Love made <HI>Jupiter</HI> a Bull, <HI>Neptune</HI> a Ram, and <HI>Apollo,</HI> like my&s;elf, a Shepherd. If they who were Gods &s;ubmitted to that all-compelling Power, &s;hall I, who am a Mortal, dare to rebel again&s;t it."</P>
<P>While the Prince was thus ju&s;tifying the &s;trange Effects of his Pa&s;&s;ion by tho&s;e great Examples, he &s;pied <HI>Fawnia</HI> at a Di&s;tance, running after one of her Sheep which had &s;trayed from the re&s;t: The Sight of that lovely Face &s;uppre&s;t in a Moment all other Emoti|ons but tho&s;e of Love and Joy.</P>
<P>He flew towards her, and &s;he, who did not know him in that Di&s;gui&s;e, but thought
<PB N="36" REF="38">
it was &s;ome genteel young Shepherd coming to meet her, &s;ecretly wi&s;hed it had been her Lot to have placed her Affections upon &s;uch a one, whom with Rea&s;on &s;he might have loved, and hoped to have obtained.</P>
<P>The Prince's nearer Approach convinced her of her Mi&s;take, &s;he &s;ighed and blu&s;hed with Plea&s;ure and Surprize, and &s;topping curt'&s;ied to him with her u&s;ual Gracefulne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> taking her Hand, pre&s;t it with pa&s;&s;ionate Tenderne&s;s to his Heart, and then fixing an ardent Ki&s;s upon it, begged her to &s;it down and li&s;ten to him a few Moments.</P>
<P>The lovely Shepherde&s;s, trembling with the mixed Emotions which Love, Hope, and Fear excited in her Soul, &s;at down with him un|der the Shade of a &s;preading Oak, and the Prince, after gazing on her for &s;ome Time with a fixed Attention, thus &s;poke.</P>
<P>"You wonder <HI>Fawnia,</HI> no Doubt, at my &s;trange Apparel, but if you knew my Thoughts you'd wonder more, the one indeed di&s;graces my outward Shape, but the others di&s;turb my Mind."</P>
<P>"I love you, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> for how can I do otherways? formed as you are to in&s;pire all who &s;ee you, with that Pa&s;&s;ion. You promi&s;ed to love me when I became a Shepherd, be|hold your Prince transformed to a Country Swain. Now then I claim the Performance of your Promi&s;e &s;ince I have fulfilled your De&s;ire."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">"'Tis true, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>Fawnia,</HI> you are changed in Appearance, but 'tis in Appear|ance only; painted Eagles are not Eagles, and Zuexis' Grapes, as I have read, were only Paint|ed Grapes; rich Ornaments do not make Prin|ces, nor rural Weeds a Swain; Shepherds are not called &s;o becau&s;e they wear pa&s;toral Attire, and have a Crook and Scrip, but becau&s;e they at|tend their Flocks, and take Care of their rural Affairs; this Apparel therefore has not made a Shepherd of a Prince, but makes a Prince appear like a Shepherd."</P>
<P>"Had I been born a Shepherd, replied <HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> I &s;hould have loved you willingly, and being a Prince I am con&s;trained to love you, do not then with an un&s;ea&s;onable Coy|ne&s;s reject a Pa&s;&s;ion which you only could have in&s;pired, now is your Time to love and be beloved, while that &s;weet Bloom glows in your charming Face, and every Feature &s;miles with the Gaiety of Youth.

<P><HI>"Fawnia,</HI> tran&s;ported with Surprize and Joy at this unhoped for Declaration, no lon|ger

kept up her forced Indifference, but be|holding the Prince with a langui&s;hing Sweet|ne&s;s, her Face being all o'er&s;pread with Blu&s;hes, "Ah! my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, I am a&s;hamed to di&s;cover the Thoughts which have long filled my Mind: Ought I, Beggar as I am, to own my De&s;ires have reached at a Prince? Oh! <HI>Dora&s;tus!</HI> I dare not &s;ay I love you, becau&s;e you are the Son of a great King, and I am a poor Shepherde&s;s, but the Gods know how I have honoured <HI>Dora&s;tus!</HI> receive then my humble, my dutiful Affection, and look on me as your Handmaid, ever ready to obey your Will in all Things which are not prejudicial to my Honour.</P>
<P><HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> overjoyed at this &s;weet and mo|de&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion of her Love for him, em|braced her with a pa&s;&s;ionate Tenderne&s;s, cal|ling all the Gods to witne&s;s the Vows he made her of everla&s;ting Love and Fidelity, and now the Lovers began to con&s;ult upon the Mea&s;ures they &s;hould take to be united for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> who knew his Father would be exce&s;&s;ively enraged at &s;uch a Match, told <HI>Fawnia</HI> there could be no Safety for them in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and that therefore he would provide a &s;ufficient Quantity of Money and Jewels to &s;upport them till &s;ome favourable Change hap|pened in their Affairs, and with the Trea&s;ure fly into <HI>Italy</HI> and there &s;olemnize their Nuptials.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;al was agreed to with great Joy by <HI>Fawnia,</HI> who trembled at the Thoughts of the King's di&s;covering their Love, believing
<PB N="39" REF="41">
that nothing le&s;s than Death would be inflicted on her for her Pre&s;umption: She therefore urged the Prince to make the nece&s;&s;ary Pre|parations for their Flight with the utmo&s;t Speed, le&s;t Fortune &s;hould cruelly prevent their Intentions.</P>
<P>The Prince, who&s;e eager Pa&s;&s;ion prompted him no le&s;s than her Fears to ha&s;ten their De|parture, a&s;&s;ured her all &s;hould be ready in a few Days, and now the approaching Night warn|ing them to depart, he took Leave of <HI>Fawnia</HI> with a tender Embrace, and repairing to the Place where he had left his Cloaths, threw off his Shepherd's Frock and returned to the Pa|lace.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> was &s;o tran&s;ported with the unex|pected Tide of good Fortune which had come ru&s;hing on her, that for &s;ome Time &s;he could hardly per&s;uade her&s;elf that all was not a Dream; but when the Tumult of her Joy was a little allayed, and calmer Reflexions &s;ucceed|ing, convinced her of the Reality of her Hap|pine&s;s, &s;he thanked the Gods devoutly for their amazing Bounty to her, and be&s;eeched them to continue their Favour and Protection to her and her beloved Prince.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> lo&s;t no Oppor|tunity of &s;eeing his lovely Shepherde&s;s; &s;he drove her Flocks to the Fields every Day, and continued to watch them as u&s;ual, not from any Delight &s;he now took in her pa&s;toral Em|ployment, but in the dear Hope of &s;eeing her beloved Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"><HI>Dora&s;tus,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he always came to meet his <HI>Fawnia</HI> in the Habit of a Shep|herd, was at la&s;t di&s;covered by &s;ome that knew him to be the Prince; &s;o that his frequent Vi&s;its to <HI>Fawnia</HI> making much Noi&s;e among the Country People, &s;ome of <HI>Porrus</HI>'s Neigh|bours, out of good Will to the old Shepherd, advi&s;ed him to keep his Daughter at home, and keep a &s;trict Eye over her, le&s;t by going &s;o often to the Field &s;he &s;hould bring him home a young Son at la&s;t, for that the young Prince came often to her, and would certainly, if he had not yet, delude her and make her his Con|cubine.</P>
<P>This News greatly &s;urprized and alarmed the good old Man, who, after thanking his Neighbours for their kind Informations, ha&s;ten|ed home to his Wife, and calling her a&s;ide, and wringing his Hands, the Tears fa&s;t falling down his aged Cheeks, "O Wife! &s;aid he, I fear, I fear our Daughter <HI>Fawnia</HI> has com|mitted Sin, and that &s;he will buy Repentance at a dear Rate: I have &s;ad News to tell you: My Neighbours tell me that the young Prince <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> looks upon <HI>Fawnia</HI> with a wi&s;tful Eye, and if that is the Ca&s;e I would not give a Wi&s;p of Straw for her Hone&s;ty at the Year's End.</P>
<P>"I tell thee, Wife, that Beauty is a great Snare to entrap young Men, and fair Words and fine Promi&s;es are great Enemies to a Maiden's Hone&s;ty; the Poor may entreat and be refu&s;ed, but Princes, if Entreaties won't

<P>He therefore with great Secrecy and Expe|dition provided a Ve&s;&s;el to tran&s;port them to <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Prince having furni&s;hed him&s;elf with a great Quantity of Money and Jewels, gave Orders to <HI>Capnio</HI> to get &s;ome rich Apparel for <HI>Fawnia;</HI> the Baggage was all &s;afely con|veyed on board, and the Ma&s;ter of the Ship perceiving the Wind likely to be favourable in a few Hours, he gave <HI>Capnio</HI> Notice that they mu&s;t come on board early the next Morning.</P>

<P>The Sailors perceiving him at a Di&s;tance rowed to Shore with their Boat, and taking in the Lovers, carried them &s;afe on board, where we mu&s;t leave them to &s;ee what happened at Land.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> having heard that the King intend|ed to take the Air that Morning, put on his Holiday Cloaths, and taking the Chain and Jewels he found with <HI>Fawnia</HI> concealed in his Bo&s;om, he took his Way to the Palace, in|tending to watch the King's coming out, at the Gate.</P>

<P><HI>Capnio</HI> immediately fore&s;eeing all the fatal Con&s;equences that might attend the old Man's Complaint at that critical Time re&s;olved to prevent it, and therefore began to wheedle him by blaming the Prince for &s;o unworthy a De&s;ign, and added, becau&s;e he was a poor Man and had no Friends to &s;tand by him, him&s;elf would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in all he could, but, &s;aid he, you will lo&s;e your Labour if you go to the Palace; for the King de&s;igns to take the Air to day on board a Ship that lies in the Harbour, and is already &s;et out; therefore if you will be ruled by me, as I am going to give them Notice of his Maje&s;ty's coming that they may be prepared to receive him, I will take you with me, and place you &s;o conveniently, that you &s;hall have all the Liberty you can de|&s;ire to make your Complaint.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> thanked his new Friend with great Submi&s;&s;ion for his proffered Kindne&s;s, and went with him to the Port, &s;till complaining of the Prince, but concealed the Chain and Jewels, and mentioned nothing concerning <HI>Fawnia</HI>'s being a Foundling.</P>

<P><HI>Porrus</HI> now &s;aw he was betrayed, but think|ing it would be fruitle&s;s to cry out or exclaim again&s;t his fal&s;e Friend, he civilly entreated him and the Sailors to be kind to him, and pity his Condition, who was but a poor Man and lived by his Labour, and &s;hould be undone if he was ab&s;ent long from his Flocks.</P>
<P>But they were as deaf to his Entreaties as the Winds and Waves to the Prayers of &s;ink|ing Mariners, and laughed to &s;ee him &s;o much afraid; having reached their Ship they obliged him to go on board, where the fir&s;t Objects he ca&s;t his Eyes on, were the Prince and <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>

<PB N="75" REF="76">
and the good old <HI>Paulina</HI> is rewarded with a|nother Hu&s;band, in the Room of her lo&s;t <HI>Antigonous.</HI></P>
<P>It has been mentioned as a great Prai&s;e to <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> that the old paltry Story of <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Fawnia</HI> &s;erved him for a Winter's Tale, but if we compare the Conduct of the Inci|dents in the Play with the paltry Story on which it is founded, we &s;hall find the Original much le&s;s ab&s;urd and ridiculous.</P>
<P>If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had even improved the Story, and cleared it of great Part of its Incon&s;i&s;ten|cies, yet he would &s;till have been accountable for what remained, for why indeed did he chu&s;e a Subject &s;o faulty for the Story of a Play; his Claim to Prai&s;e would have been but very &s;mall, by making what was bad bet|ter, &s;ince he was free in the Choice of his Subject; but certainly he can have no Preten|&s;ions to it at all by changing bad to wor&s;e; that he has done &s;o will be ea&s;ily proved by ex|amining &s;ome of the principal Incidents, as they are differently managed by the Noveli&s;t and the Poet.</P>
<P>The King's Jealou&s;y is the Foundation of all the Adventures that followed, but extra|vagant as its Con&s;equences are in both, yet the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of this terrible Pa&s;&s;ion is better accounted for in the Novel than the Play: In the fir&s;t we are told that <HI>Pando&s;to,</HI> charmed with the friendly Vi&s;it <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> paid him in his Dominions, de&s;ired the Queen to
<PB N="76" REF="77">
treat her royal Gue&s;t with, the Re&s;pect and E&s;teem that was due to his Merit and the Friend&s;hip he had for him; the Queen, like an obedient Wife, complies with her Hu&s;|band's Directions, and perhaps over-acts her Part. The King begins to think he has been too officious; the innocent Familiarity be|tween his Wife and Friend creates Su&s;picions, which meeting with a Mind prepared by a natural Di&s;tru&s;tfulne&s;s to receive them, pro|duces tho&s;e Sparks of Jealou&s;y which his in|tere&s;ted Ob&s;ervations on all their Looks, Words, and Actions, afterwards blew into a Flame.</P>
<P>This Account of the King's Jealou&s;y does not ab&s;olutely cla&s;h with Probability. But let us &s;ee how <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> manages it in the Play; the two Kings make their fir&s;t Ap|pearance in the &s;econd Scene in high Friend|&s;hip and Confidence; <HI>Polixenes</HI> reminding his Friend of the Length of his Vi&s;it, tells him he is now re&s;olved to be gone.</P>
<P><HI>Leontes,</HI> not able to part with him, pre&s;&s;es him earne&s;tly to &s;tay longer, <HI>Polixenes</HI> urges the Nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;peedy Departure, and truly, as he ob&s;erves, nine Months is a great while for a good King to be out of his own Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>Leontes,</HI> after many fruitle&s;s Intreaties, re|proaches his Queen for not endeavouring to detain <HI>Polixenes,</HI> &s;he, in obedience to his Com|mands, pre&s;&s;es him to gratify her Lord by a
<PB N="77" REF="78">
little longer Stay; <HI>Polixenes</HI> complies at her Reque&s;t, and certainly he mu&s;t be a very ill bred Monarch had he done otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>All this Conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;es in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Leontes,</HI> who from hence takes Occa&s;ion to be jealous, and pa&s;&s;es in an In&s;tant from the greate&s;t Confidence, Security, and Friend|&s;hip imaginable, to the la&s;t Extremity of Jea|lou&s;y and Rage. What wonderful Contriv|ance is here? The Legerdemain, who &s;hews you a Tree that buds Blo&s;&s;oms and bears ripe Fruit in the Space of five Minutes, does not put &s;o great a Cheat on the Sen&s;es, as <HI>Shake&s;|pear</HI> does on the Under&s;tanding; for this Jealou&s;y of one Minute's Growth we &s;ee take Root before our Eyes, and &s;o far from there being the &s;malle&s;t Progre&s;&s;ion in the &s;everal Actions of budding, blo&s;&s;oming, and bear|ing ripe Fruit, that we have the fir&s;t and the la&s;t at one and the &s;ame In&s;tant.</P>
<P>The extravagant Effects of the King's Rage and Jealou&s;y are carried far enough in all Con&s;cience in the Novel, and <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is not a Whit more moderate; only he has altered a Circum&s;tance which entirely de&s;troys the lit|tle Probability the Noveli&s;t had pre&s;erved in the Relation.</P>
<P>In the Story, the King being in his own Mind firmly per&s;uaded of the Queen's Guilt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rders her to be impri&s;oned, and the Daughter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at &s;he was delivered of in Pri&s;on to be burnt; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Intreaties of his Courtiers he rever&s;es
<PB N="78" REF="79">
the Sentence pa&s;t on the Child, and com|mands it to be expo&s;ed in a Boat, but declares that his Queen &s;hall die.</P>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ts upon being confronted with her Accu&s;ers, whereupon &s;he is brought to a Tryal; but finding &s;he was likely to meet with no Ju&s;|tice in a Court over-ruled by the Power of her Hu&s;band, &s;he on her Knees prote&s;ts her In|nocence, and intreats the King to con&s;ult the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> concerning the Crimes of which &s;he was accu&s;ed. This &s;o rea&s;onable a Reque&s;t being made in open Court, the King could not refu&s;e it, and therefore &s;ends Am|ba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Delphos;</HI> who return with the An|&s;wer of the God; which being read, declares her Innocence, and the King is &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes the King in the Heighth of his Frenzy of Jealou&s;y &s;end him&s;elf to the Oracle of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and in the mean Time com|mit the mo&s;t barbarous Cruelties on his Queen and Child. How incon&s;i&s;tent is this! why does he con&s;ult the Oracle if he is re&s;olved to proceed to Extremities before the An&s;wer ar|rives? The Reque&s;t comes very naturally from the Queen in the Novel, and the King's Compliance with it is very well accounted for, but in the Play nothing can be more ab&s;urd than that the King &s;hould be rea&s;onable enough to con&s;ult voluntarily the Gods concerning the Infidelity of his Wife; and while the An|&s;wer was expected, and her Guilt yet doubt|ful, puni&s;h her with as much Rigour as if the Oracle had declared her an Adultre&s;s. Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="79" REF="80">
again the paltry Story has the Advantage of the Play. Let us go on to examine a few more of the Incidents.</P>
<P>In the Novel, the Per&s;ons who perform the hateful Office of expo&s;ing the Infant Prince&s;s are &s;ome of the King's Guards.</P>
<P>In the Play, it is a Nobleman of high Rank, who had Courage enough to reprove the King for his violent and unju&s;t Jealou&s;y, yet ba&s;ely &s;ubmits to take an Oath to perform his Commands, though he had Rea&s;on to think they would not be very mild, and &s;till more ba&s;ely keeps that Oath, though it enjoins him to carry the innocent Babe to a De&s;ert, and there leave it to the Mercy of the wild Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the Novel, the Accidents that happen to the expo&s;ed Infant are governed by Chance; the Boat into which it was put being left in the mid&s;t of the Ocean, is driven by the Winds to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and being &s;pied by a Shepherd is drawn to Land.</P>
<P>In the Play, <HI>Antigonous,</HI> who is bound by Oath to leave the Child in &s;ome de&s;ert Place quite out of its Father's Dominions, is warn|ed in a Dream by its unhappy Mother to call the Infant <HI>Perdita,</HI> and carry it to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and there leave it.</P>
<P><HI>Antigonous</HI> obeys, and this done, it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould never return to <HI>Sicily,</HI> otherwi&s;e it may be di&s;covered where the Prince&s;s is left, and all the future Adven|tures would fall to the Ground, therefore a Bear ru&s;hes out of the Woods and devours
<PB N="80" REF="81">
him; the good-natured Bear, as it &s;hould &s;eem, re&s;olved not to &s;poil the Story, pa&s;&s;es by the little Prince&s;s, who is to make &s;o great a Fi|gure hereafter, and a convenient Storm ari&s;ing, &s;plits the Ship in which &s;he was brought thither, &s;o that all the Sailors peri&s;hing, though they were near enough the Shore to have &s;av|ed them&s;elves, no one is left to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry back any Account of the Affair to <HI>Sicily,</HI> and thereby prevent the Adventures which are to follow.</P>
<P>All this is very wonderful: <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> mul|tiplies Miracle upon Miracle to bring about the &s;ame Events in the Play, which Chance, with much more Propriety, performs in the Novel.</P>
<P>The Loves of the young Prince of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and the royal Shepherde&s;s are carried on much in the &s;ame Manner by the Poet as the No|veli&s;t; <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has even borrowed &s;ome of the Thoughts from the latter in this Speech of <HI>Florizel</HI> to <HI>Perdita.</HI></P>
<Q><L>The Gods them&s;elves,</L>
<L>Humbling their Deities to Love, have taken</L>
<L>The Shapes of Bea&s;ts upon them. <HI>Jupiter</HI></L>
<L>Became a Bull, and bellow'd the Green. <HI>Neptune</HI></L>
<L>A Ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd God,</L>
<L>Golden <HI>Apollo,</HI> a poor humble Swain,</L>
<L>As I &s;eem now. Their Transformations</L>
<L>Were never for a Piece of Beauty rarer,</L>
<L>Nor in a Way &s;o cha&s;te. Since my De&s;ires</L>
<L>Run not before my Honour, nor my Lu&s;ts</L>
<L>Burn hotter than my Faith.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="81" REF="82"><HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> &s;peaks almo&s;t the &s;ame Words in the Novel, "The Gods them&s;elves have not di&s;dained to love: <HI>Jupiter</HI> was enamoured of <HI>Dana&euml;,</HI> and the bright <HI>Apollo</HI> woo'd the inex|orable <HI>Daphne;</HI> the&s;e were mortal Beauties, and they were Deities; why then, though a Prince, may not I love a Shepherde&s;s, but their Pa&s;&s;ions were di&s;honourable, mine is pure and cha&s;te, 'tis true, and herein I &s;urpa&s;s the Gods; be &s;till then, O my Soul, for 'tis decreed, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> the adorable <HI>Fawnia,</HI> &s;hall be mine."</P>
<P>The E&s;cape of the two Lovers is very dif|ferently managed in the Novel and Play; in the fir&s;t, the Prince being pre&s;&s;ed by his Fa|ther to marry, re&s;olves to leave <HI>Sicily</HI> with <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and fly into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he intend|ed to live concealed till his Father's Death, or that he could reconcile him to his Marriage with the beautiful Shepherde&s;s; having pro|cured a Ship, and a &s;ufficient Quantity of Money and Jewels, he meets <HI>Fawnia</HI> early in the Morning and carries her to the Port, they embark, and &s;teer their Cour&s;e for <HI>Italy,</HI> but are driven by contrary Winds to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> where they are obliged to land.</P>
<P>In the Play, <HI>Florizel</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed in the Habit of a Shepherd for the Sake of <HI>Perdita,</HI> a&s;|&s;i&s;ts at a Sheep&s;hearing Fea&s;t. The King, his Father, being informed of his Son's Re&s;ort to the Hou&s;e of a Shepherd, goes there di&s;|gui&s;ed with his Confidant, <HI>Camillo,</HI> and comes
<PB N="82" REF="83">
very opportunely to hear the Prince, his Son declare his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Fair Shepherde&s;s pub|licly, and his Intentions of marrying her; nay he carries his Indi&s;cretion &s;o far as to join Hands with her before all the Country People who are pre&s;ent; can any Thing be more ab&s;urd?</P>
<P>The King, &s;ufficiently informed of his Son's De&s;igns, di&s;covers him&s;elf, and forbids the Bans: this is indeed a terrible Stroke; one would be puzzled to think how the Lovers will e&s;cape; for is it not natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the enraged King will keep his Son in a &s;trict Con|finement to prevent this unequal Match; but it happens quite otherwi&s;e; for the King, after &s;ome &s;evere Menaces, goes back to his Palace, and leaves his Son at Liberty to run away with the Country Girl, which he accordingly does.</P>
<P>The Part <HI>Camillo</HI> acts in this Affair is not more con&s;i&s;tent; he longs to &s;ee again his old Ma&s;ter <HI>Leontes</HI> and his native Country <HI>Si|cilia,</HI> which he had quitted to pre&s;erve <HI>Po|lixenes,</HI> and becau&s;e this Monarch loved him &s;o well that he could not bear his Ab&s;ence, and gently denied him Permi&s;&s;ion to go, <HI>Camillo</HI> betrays the Confidence he repo&s;ed in him, con|&s;ents to the Prince's Flight, and advi&s;es him to take Refuge in <HI>Sicilia,</HI> in Hopes that <HI>Polixenes,</HI> to whom he intended to di&s;cover where the Prince was gone, would follow him, and thus he might again return to his own Country.</P>
<P>This double Treachery and &s;elf-intere&s;ted Views are very incon&s;i&s;tent with the Character
<PB N="83" REF="84">
of &s;o hone&s;t a Man as <HI>Camillo</HI> is repre&s;ented to be; be&s;ides the Contrivance is ab&s;olutely ridi|culous; for what Rea&s;on had the Prince to &s;up|po&s;e that <HI>Leontes,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to be reconciled to the King his Father, whom he had &s;o greatly injured, would offend him anew by protecting his Son, who had fled from him in order to marry a poor Shepherde&s;s, for he could not expect the Story, however he di&s;gui&s;ed it, would be long concealed from him; and why &s;hould <HI>Camillo</HI> &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Polixenes,</HI> when he was informed of his Son's Flight, would quit his Dominions to follow him, and put his Per&s;on again in the Power of a King who had once de&s;igned to murder him: was it not more likely that he would &s;end Amba&s;&s;a|dors to demand the Prince of <HI>Leontes,</HI> who would then have an Opportunity of &s;hewing if his Penitence was &s;incere by &s;ending him back again; but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has fallen into all the&s;e Ab&s;urdities in order to bring the chief Characters in his Play together at <HI>Sicilia,</HI> tho' for &s;ome of them there was not the lea&s;t Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Incidents that lead to the Di&s;|covery of <HI>Fawnia</HI> are conducted with &s;ome Shadow of Probability in the Novel, but are much the wor&s;e for <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Alterations.</P>
<P>In the Novel <HI>Capnio,</HI> the Prince's Confi|dant, as he is ha&s;tening after him to the Port, meets the Father of <HI>Fawnia</HI> going to Court,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
and &s;u&s;pecting his De&s;ign, he artfully per&s;uades him to follow him, and, partly by Stratagem, and partly by Force, carries him on board the Ve&s;&s;el in which the Prince and <HI>Fawnia</HI> were embarked; the old Man had taken with him when he left his Hou&s;e the Chain and Jewels he found with <HI>Fawnia</HI> in order to &s;hew them to the King and relate the Manner in which he found her; but being prevented in this De|&s;ign by <HI>Capnio,</HI> who obliged him to be the Com|panion of their Flight, he very prudently con|tinues to conceal from <HI>Fawnia</HI> the Circum|&s;tance of her Birth; and, to &s;ecure to him&s;elf a re&s;pectful Treatment from the Prince and her, &s;uffers her &s;till to believe him her Father; but when at <HI>Bohemia</HI> the King of <HI>Sicilia</HI>'s Am|ba&s;&s;adors di&s;cover who they are, and the old Shepherd and <HI>Fawnia</HI> are by the King of <HI>Bo|hemia</HI> ordered to be put to Death for deluding the Prince of <HI>Sicily,</HI> he then declares that <HI>Faw|nia</HI> is not his Daughter, and produces the Chain and Jewels he found with her as Proofs that her Birth was not mean; the King at the Sight of the&s;e Tokens knows and acknow|ledges his Daughter.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e Circum&s;tances are altered by <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI>&mdash;The Prince having changed Cloaths with a cheating Pedlar, e&s;capes with his Mi&s;tre&s;s to the Ship; the Pedlar imme|diately over-hears a Conver&s;ation between the reputed Father of <HI>Perdita</HI> and his Son, in which it is re&s;olved that he &s;hall carry the Jewels to the King and declare how he found <HI>Perdita;</HI> the Pedlar &s;uppo&s;ing it would be an

Advantage to the Prince to know this, decoys the old Shepherd and his Son aboard; now one would imagine that all mu&s;t come out; but &s;ee what &s;trange Accidents con&s;pire to hinder it.</P>
<P>The Pedlar, though he over-heard the old Shepherd &s;ay that <HI>Perdita</HI> was a Foundling and not his Daughter, neglects to tell the Prince this important Circum&s;tance, though it was with that very De&s;ign he came and forced the two Clowns along with him.</P>
<P><HI>Perdita,</HI> though her Father and Brother are in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el with her, never &s;ees or &s;peaks to them: the old Shepherd and his Son make no Attempts to &s;peak to her; and the Prince has &s;o little Con&s;ideration for the Fa|ther and Brother of his Beloved that he takes no Notice of them; how wonderful is all this! the mo&s;t unlikely Things imaginable fall out to po&s;tpone the Di&s;covery of <HI>Perdita</HI> till their Arrival at <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>The Novel makes the Wife of the jealous King die through Affliction for the Lo&s;s of her Son; <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;eems to have pre&s;erved her alive for the &s;ake of her repre&s;enting her own Statue in the la&s;t Scene; a mean and ab&s;urd Contrivance; for how can it be imagined that <HI>Hermione,</HI> a virtuous and affectionate Wife, would conceal her&s;elf during &s;ixteen Years in a &s;olitary Hou&s;e, though &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er repentant Hu&s;band was all that Time con|&s;uming
<PB N="86" REF="87">
away with Grief and Remor&s;e for her Death; and what Rea&s;on could &s;he have for chu&s;ing to live in &s;uch a mi&s;erable Confinement, when &s;he might have been happy in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Hu&s;band's Affection and have &s;hared his Throne: how ridiculous al&s;o in a great Queen, on &s;o interre&s;ting an Occa&s;ion, to &s;ubmit to &s;uch Buffoonery as &s;tanding on a Pede&s;tal, motionle&s;s, her Eyes fixed, and at la&s;t to be conjured down by this magical Com|mand of <HI>Paulina.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Mu&s;ic, awake her; &s;trike;</L>
<L>'Tis Time, de&s;cend; be Stone no more; ap|proach;</L>

<L>I'll fill your Grave; up &s;tir; nay, come away;</L>
<L>Bequeath to Death your Numbne&s;s, for from him</L>
<L>Dear Life redeems you.</L></Q>
<P>After this &s;olemn Incantation, her Maje&s;ty comes down from the Pede&s;tal and embraces her Hu&s;band, and her new found Daughter, for who&s;e Sake &s;he declares &s;he had pre&s;erved her Life.</P>
<P>To bring about this Scene, ridiculous as it is, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has been guilty of many Ab|&s;urdities, which would be too tedious to men|tion, and which are too glaring to e&s;cape the Ob&s;ervation of the mo&s;t carele&s;s Reader.</P>
<P>The Novel has nothing in it half &s;o low and improbable as this Contrivance of the
<PB N="87" REF="88">
Statue; and indeed wherever <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has altered or invented, his <HI>Winter</HI>'s <HI>Tale</HI> is great|ly inferior to the old paltry Story that furni&s;h|ed him with the Subject of it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer,</HI> in his Edition of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> has this Note at the Beginning of the <HI>Winter Tale.</HI></P>
<P>This Country, here called <HI>Bithynia,</HI> hath in all former Editions been printed <HI>Bohemia,</HI> an inland Kingdom, &s;ituated nearly in the Center of <HI>Europe</HI>; whereas many of the great Incidents of the Play turn upon its be|ing a maritime Country, of which <HI>Polixenes</HI> was the King. This is a Blunder and an Ab|&s;urdity, of which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> in Ju&s;tice ought not to be thought capable, and as he hath turned quite anew the Story contained in the old paltry Book of <HI>Dora&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Fawnia,</HI> changing mo&s;t of the main Circum&s;tances, and all the Names of the Per&s;ons; it is pro|bable he removed this Impropriety, and plac|ed the Scene in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> which the Ignorance and Negligence of the fir&s;t Tran&s;cribers, or Printers, might corrupt and bring back again to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by a le&s;s Variation in the Letters than they have been guilty of in numberle&s;s other Places of this Work.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in his Two Gentlemen of <HI>Verona,</HI> makes <HI>Protheus</HI> travel from <HI>Verona</HI> to <HI>Milan</HI> by Sea.

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>I Begin, Gentlemen, with telling you that I wi&s;h you all as well as my&s;elf; here is a Comedy of <HI>Plautus</HI> which I bring you, and intreat you will give it a favourable At|tention; li&s;ten now to the Subject of the Play, and be &s;ilent, I &s;hall endeavour to compri&s;e it in as few Words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>'Tis cu&s;tomary with Poets in their Come|dies to make one believe that all pa&s;&s;es at <HI>Athens,</HI> to the End that the Subject may ap|pear entirely <HI>Grecian,</HI> and may be more e&s;teemed by the Spectators; as for me I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay that what we are going to repre&s;ent here to Day happened in any other Place than where it really did.</P>
<P>The Subject of this Piece is truly <HI>Grecian,</HI> yet notwith&s;tanding that it is not <HI>Attick,</HI> but <HI>Sicilian,</HI> and what I have hitherto &s;aid is only the Introduction to it.</P>
<P>In explaining the Argument to you I &s;hall not amu&s;e my&s;elf with &s;hewing you Patterns only, but pre&s;ent you with the whole Piece, for it is my Intention to be very full in the Expo&s;ition of this Intrigue.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="92">There was formerly at <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> a good plain &s;imple Man, a Merchant by Profe&s;&s;ion, his Wife was delivered of two Sons at one Birth, who &s;o perfectly re&s;embled each other, that the Nur&s;e who &s;uckled them, and the Mother who bore them were not able to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other. This I was told by a Per&s;on who &s;aw them; for my own Part I ne|ver did &s;ee them, and I tell you &s;o that you may not be deceived.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two Children arrived to the Age of &s;even Years, their Father took one of them with him on board a Ve&s;&s;el which he had loaded with Merchandize, and carried him to <HI>Tarentum,</HI> whither he went to trade, leav|ing the other at home with his Mother.</P>
<P>It happened that when they arrived at <HI>Ta|rentum</HI> they were celebrating Games, which, as it is u&s;ual with public Spectacles, drew to|gether great Numbers of People.</P>
<P>The little Boy &s;traying from his Father was taken up by a Merchant of <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> who carried him into his own Country; the Fa|ther's Affliction for the Lo&s;s of his Son was &s;o great that it deprived him of his Sen&s;es, and a few Days after of his Life.</P>
<P>This News being carried to <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> the Grandfather of the two Children under&s;tand|ing that one of them was taken away at <HI>Ta|rentum,</HI> and that the Father was dead, changed the Name of his Grand&s;on who remained with him, and gave him that of his Brother that was lo&s;t, whom he had loved extremely and was de&s;irous of pre&s;erving the Remembrance
<PB N="93" REF="93">
of; he called him therefore <HI>Menaechmus,</HI> a Name that was common to him&s;elf as well as to the Twins.</P>
<P>This Circum&s;tance I remember very well, having heard it proclaimed by the public Criers; and that you may avoid Mi&s;takes, I inform you beforehand, that the&s;e twin Bro|thers have both the &s;ame Name.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t now return to <HI>Epidamnum:</HI> Is there any one among you who has Occa&s;ion for any Thing from that Country? If there be, he needs only to &s;peak, and command me freely; however, he mu&s;t under&s;tand, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give me Money to enable me to perform his Commi&s;&s;ion; for to give me no Money would be a very great Folly, and to give me Money a &s;till greater; I return then to the Place from whence I came; ne|verthele&s;s, I do not budge from this Spot.</P>
<P>This Merchant of <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> of whom I have &s;poken &s;o much, and who took away one of the twin Brothers, had no Chil|dren, but in every Thing el&s;e he was very rich; he adopted therefore the &s;tolen Child; bred him up as his own Son; married him to a Woman with a large Fortune; and made a Will by which he left him his whole E&s;tate: One Day, when he went into the Country, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t rained violently, and being obliged to pa&s;s a very rapid River, not far from the City, the Force of the Stream carried away this Ra|vi&s;her
<PB N="94" REF="94">
of Children, and hurried him to the Fu|ries in Spite of his Teeth.</P>
<P>Behold now the young Man e&s;tabli&s;hed a <HI>Epidamnum</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great Fortune; his Brother brought up at <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> is this Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> arrived at <HI>Epidamnum</HI> with his Servant it Search of this other Brother; for this Rea|&s;on the City of <HI>Epidamnum</HI> will be the Scene of this Comedy; when we play another the Scene al&s;o &s;hall be changed; for you know the Subjects are not always the &s;ame; &s;ome|times we play a Merchant of Slaves, &s;ome|times a young Debauchee, &s;ometimes a poor Man, a Beggar, a King, a Para&s;ite, or a Fortune-teller.</P>

<P>_THE Name of <HI>Peniculus,</HI> which I bear, was given me by the young People of the City, be|cau&s;e when I am at Table I know &s;o well how to make it clean. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Ma&s;ters who load their fugitive Slaves with Chains, are in my Opinion guilty of great Folly; for a poor Wretch who &s;ees a new Evil added to tho&s;e he &s;uffered before is but the more incited to commit new Rogueries, and to avoid Puni&s;hment by Flight; the&s;e Peo|ple never fail of extricating them&s;elves out of Difficulties: Sometimes they force open the
<PB N="96" REF="96">
Lock with a File; &s;ometimes they break the Hinges of the Door with a Stone; all the Pre|cautions one takes with them are u&s;ele&s;s; the be&s;t Way to prevent a Servant from flying, is to attach them to one's &s;elf by good Nouri&s;h|ment; tye the&s;e Sort of Animals to a good Rack and give them Plenty of Provender, and take my Word for it they will not run away whatever Fault they have committed; they may be ea&s;ily guarded if you make u&s;e of the&s;e Chains to retain them; the Ligaments of the Jaws are &s;o pliant, that the more they are &s;tretched the clo&s;er they may be drawn.</P>
<P>For a Proof of this I am going to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Menaechmus</HI> to get my&s;elf tyed in this Manner, and voluntary &s;ubmit to a Sentence which has been long ago pa&s;&s;ed upon me; <HI>Menaechmus</HI> is a Man who not only feeds People well, but even gives them a new Birth and new Life; he is the fir&s;t Man in the World for perform|ing wonderful Cures; he is ble&s;t with a noble Appetite him&s;elf; you would &s;ay that each of his Repa&s;ts is a Fea&s;t; &s;o well he knows how to furni&s;h a Table; there is nothing to be &s;een on all Sides but Pyramids of Di&s;hes, &s;o that if one wants any Thing from the other End of the Table, one is obliged to rai&s;e one's &s;elf quite up from the Bed to reach it.</P>
<P>I have been many Days ab&s;ent from him, dur|ing which Time I have remained &s;hut up at home with my dear little Family, for I cannot eat or drink any Thing that does not co&s;t me very dear, therefore I am &s;ometimes obliged to fa&s;t for Want of Money: I am now going to vi&s;it

<P>IN my Opinion, my dear <HI>Me&s;&s;enion,</HI> the&s;e Sea-fearing Men know no greater Plea&s;ure in the World than when after a long Voyage, they fir&s;t di&s;cover Land.</P>

<P>With Submi&s;&s;ion, Sir, I think the Plea&s;ure is &s;till more &s;en&s;ibly felt by tho&s;e who after a te|dious Ab&s;ence from their own Country behold again the well known Port, and are ready to touch the Shore: But tell me, I be&s;eech you, Sir, what are we come to do here at <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> are you re&s;olved to imitate the Sea, and go round all the I&s;lands?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="113" REF="113">
<SPEAKER>MESSENION.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you imagine will be the I&s;&s;ue of this Search, 'tis now &s;ix Years &s;ince we have wandered on the Sea in a vain Expectation of finding him; we have &s;ailed round all <HI>I&s;tria, Spain,</HI> the Country of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;ilia</HI> and <HI>Illyria,</HI> we have overrun all the <HI>Adriatic</HI> Sea, <HI>bar|barous Greece,</HI> and all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Italy</HI> that are wa&s;hed by the Ocean? Had we been &s;eeking for a Needle in a Bundle of Hay we &s;hould have found it by this Time, provided it was not invi&s;ible. In vain do we hope to find a dead Man among&s;t the Living, for if he were &s;till in Being, &s;hou'd we not have met with &s;ome one e'er now who cou'd have given &s;ome Intelligence of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am determin'd never to give over my Search till I have found my Brother, or met with &s;ome Per&s;on, who having known him, can certainly inform me that he is dead. This pining Anxiety will then be at an End, and I will return to <HI>Syracu&s;e;</HI> but till I have that Satisfaction, while Life animates this Body I will not cea&s;e to wander about the World, and &s;eek him every where; too &s;en&s;ibly do I feel the Force of fraternal Affection to quit ea&s;ily the Hope of &s;eeing my Brother again.</P>

Ah! without Doubt he is gone to the Hou&s;e of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and was not willing that I &s;hou'd accompany him, and be a Witne&s;s of his Plea&s;ures: May the Gods pour down their fierce&s;t Wrath upon him who fir&s;t introduced A&s;&s;emblies, and thereby hindered People who have important Affairs upon their Hands from pur&s;uing their Bu&s;ine&s;s. A&s;&s;emblies ought only to be compo&s;ed of indolent and idle Per|&s;ons, &s;uch ought to be &s;ummoned to appear, and when they don't obey, be puni&s;hed by large Fines.

If the Client is poor, though his Behaviour be ever &s;o unexceptionable, yet he pa&s;&s;es for a Man who has very bad Principles; if he be rich, however wicked and ba&s;e his Life and Manners, yet we extol him for a Man of great Virtue; there are &s;ome who regard nei|ther Law or Equity, who are continually per|&s;ecuting their Patrons, who deny to have re|ceived what has been given them, and who having acquired large Fortunes by U&s;ury and &s;wearing fal&s;ely, delight in continually involv|ing them&s;elves and others in Law&s;uits; when they have determined on a Day to have their Cau&s;es pleaded, they acquaint their Advocates or Patrons with it, and whatever Crimes they have committed, they mu&s;t defend them whether the Cau&s;e be pleaded before the Peo|ple, before the Pretor, or before the Judge.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am going to my Daughter's Hou&s;e as fa&s;t as my great Age will permit me, but well I know this Walk will be very difficult, for every Step is &s;lower than the former, I &s;ink under the Weight of Years, and drag a heavy Body, which my Limbs are hardly able to &s;upport; my Strength is almo&s;t gone, I carry my Years on my Back like bad Merchandize, for this wicked old Age, whenever it comes, brings with it a great many Followers, a Croud of Inconveniencies and natural Defects; in &s;hort, old Age is &s;ubject to &s;o many Mi&s;eries that if I undertook to recount them I &s;hou'd die before the Detail was ended. But be&s;ides the Pain of being old, which is not &s;mall, I am a&s;&s;aulted by a new Affliction that touches me &s;en&s;ibly; my Daughter has &s;ent for me in a violent Hurry, &s;he intreats that I will come immediately; what can be the occa&s;ion of this Me&s;&s;age? what Accident has happened? my Imagination repre&s;ents a thou&s;and different Things to me, all equally tormenting.</P>
<P>But what I am mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed at is, that my Daughter has &s;ent only a general Me&s;&s;age, which gives me no Light into the Affair. Ah! &s;he wou'd have done better to have &s;pared
<PB N="171" REF="171">
me this Anxiety by informing me exactly what the Bu&s;ine&s;s is. Mean Time I conjecture, I divine, and I am much deceived if I am not right, &s;ome new Family Storm, &s;ome dome&s;|tic Hurricane has occa&s;ioned this Me&s;&s;age. Women who bring large Portions to their Hu&s;bands expect to make them wear the Yoke; the&s;e Women I &s;ay are generally very bad, and if the poor Hu&s;band endeavours but ever &s;o little to maintain his Right of Superiority, the Hou&s;e will be always full of Noi&s;e; the Hu&s;bands indeed often abu&s;e their Power, and then 'tis they who are in the wrong. To ren|der the conjugal State happy, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that the Authority of the Hu&s;band ought to be exerted with Prudence; and the Submi&s;&s;i|on of the Wife be bounded by Rea&s;on; by <HI>Pollux!</HI> it certainly is not for any trivial Mat|ter that my Drughter has &s;ent for me, 'tis &s;omething of Con&s;equence, but whatever it is I &s;hall know pre&s;ently. Ha! do I not &s;ee this Couple before the Door of their Hou&s;e; the Hu&s;band has a di&s;contented Air, his Un|ea&s;ine&s;s is painted in his Countenance, how well have I gue&s;s'd! they are quarrelling, ah!

But how can this be, for I am very &s;ure that &s;ince my fir&s;t Entrance into Life I have never been &s;eiz'd with any
<PB N="193" REF="193">
Symptoms of this Di&s;temper. Is this black Su&s;picion owing to Malice or Mi&s;take? 'Tis &s;trange! 'tis unaccountable! &s;urely I am not mad. I neither in&s;ult, quarrel with, or &s;trike any Per&s;ons that come in my way; my Mind is calm, my Thoughts are rea&s;onable; my Behaviour is not different from other Peo|ple; when I &s;peak to them they reply, when they &s;peak to me I an&s;wer them again, and with as much Judgment as ever I did before. 'Tis not I then that am mad, but tho&s;e who reproach me with Madne&s;s have their own Brains cracked; People that labour under &s;uch Di&s;orders, &s;u&s;pect others to be what they are them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But this is not all that afflicts me, for how &s;hall I di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf at pre&s;ent? to which Side &s;hall I turn? I dare not attempt to get into my own Hou&s;e, for my Lamb of a Wife will refu&s;e me Entrance, and from my Mi&s;|tre&s;s nothing is to be expected; her Door is &s;hut again&s;t me, no one will venture to in|troduce me, we are upon &s;uch bad Terms with each other.&mdash;I have no other Re&s;ource but to wait here for the Approach of Night, my Wife perhaps may be then &s;eiz'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, and will permit me to take Part of her Bed.</P>

<P>The Merit of a good Slave con&s;i&s;ts in tak|ing great Care of his Ma&s;ter's Sub&s;tance, in laying it out wi&s;ely, in being attentive to his
<PB N="194" REF="194">
Intere&s;ts; in &s;hort, a good Slave &s;hou'd in his Ma&s;ter's Ab&s;ence manage his Money in the &s;ame Manner as if he was pre&s;ent, or rather with more Circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>A wi&s;e Dome&s;tic will always con&s;ider his Shoulders more than his Mouth, he will think it more nece&s;&s;ary to provide for the Ea&s;e of his Legs than for the filling his Belly, and have the Reward he expects from his Ma&s;ter continually before his Eyes. But what is the Reward that a wicked idle Slave has Rea&s;on to hope for? in what Coin is he paid? why, with heavy Stripes, Fetters, grinding in Mills, cruel Fatigues, ravenous Hunger, and peri&s;hing Cold; the&s;e are the natural Con|&s;equences of Di&s;obedience and Guilt.</P>
<P>As for me, I am a declared Enemy to all the&s;e Things; there is not one of them con|venient, not one that &s;uits my Ta&s;te, or does not put me into a horrible Fear; 'tis for this Rea&s;on that I am firmly re&s;olved to be good for &s;omething, and always prefer good Service to bad. I am not moved by har&s;h Language, or Reproaches, however unde|&s;erved; for after all they are only Words, and Words &s;trike nothing but the Air, but as for Blows, your humble Servant; I am not for them, I hate them mortally, the Impre&s;&s;ion they make, is a little too &s;trong.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, al&s;o, that I eat much more willingly what the Labours of others &s;upply me with, than my own; Bread made with Flower of my Grinding wou'd ta&s;te very bit|ter,
<PB N="195" REF="195">
but it goes down very plea&s;antly, when done by the Fatigue of my Comrades. There|fore I am always ready to obey my Ma&s;ter's Commands, I execute his Orders punctually, I &s;erve him with Diligence and Alacrity, and I find my&s;elf in a very happy Situation, with the&s;e my &s;ervile Maxims.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Slaves, who becau&s;e of their good Behaviour have nothing to fear, and yet are naturally timid, tho&s;e Slaves, I &s;ay, are ge|nerally mo&s;t u&s;eful to their Ma&s;ters; on the contrary, tho&s;e who are bold, determined, and arrogant, are the greate&s;t Tremblers in the World, when by their Faults they have drawn the Indignation of their Ma&s;ters upon them.</P>
<P>Thanks to the Gods, I have no Rea&s;on to be afraid, my Ma&s;ter will in a little Time re|ward me for my faithful Service; in the mean Time this is my governing Principle, to do always what is mo&s;t for the Ea&s;e of my Back.</P>
<P>After having &s;ecured my Ma&s;ter's Servants and Baggage in the Inn, as he commanded me, I came back to wait his Orders, 'tis fit I knock at the Door, that he might be informed that I am here. Oh! that I may be &s;o hap|py as to &s;ee him come out &s;afe and &s;ound from this damn'd Hou&s;e; but I fear I am come too late, and that it will be after Death the Phy|&s;ician.</P>

<P><HI>SHAKESPEAR</HI>'s <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> has been generally allowed to be founded on the <HI>Menaechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus.</HI> Mr. <HI>Langbain,</HI> in his Account of the Dramatic Poets, &s;ays that if it be not a ju&s;t Tran&s;lation of it, it is at lea&s;t a Paraphra&s;e, and in his Opinion far be|yond a Tran&s;lation, called <HI>Manaechmus,</HI> Print|ed at <HI>London,</HI> 1593.</P>
<P>From this Tran&s;lation of <HI>Plautus</HI>'s <HI>Me|naechmi, Shake&s;pear</HI> certainly borrowed his <HI>Comedy of Errors;</HI> but not being able to pro|cure a Copy of it, and being wholly unac|quainted with the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, I have turn|ed Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gueudiville</HI>'s <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Menaechmi</HI> into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which al|though, as I am informed, it be not very li|teral as to the Dialogue, yet the Plot, the In|cidents, and Characters, being exactly the &s;ame with the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet's, it will &s;erve to &s;hew how much of the Plot <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has borrowed in his <HI>Comedy of Errors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="219">That we may be the better able to trace him in his Imitations, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to examine the <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> Scene by Scene, and take the Story a little higher than the Commencement of the Action of the Play.</P>
<P>The Cities of <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> and <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> being at War with each other, a Law was made in both, by which it was provided, that if any <HI>Ephe&s;ian</HI> Merchant was &s;een to traffic in <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> or any <HI>Syracu&s;an</HI> Merchant in <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> his Goods &s;hould be confi&s;cated, and him&s;elf condemn|ed to Death.</P>
<P>An old Merchant of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> named <HI>Aegeon,</HI> landing at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> is apprehended upon this Law.</P>
<P>Here the Action of the Play begins, as <HI>Aegeon</HI> is leading to Pri&s;on, the Duke of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> meeting him, demands the Cau&s;e of his hav|ing left his native Country, and coming to <HI>Ephe&s;us; Aegeon</HI> thereupon gives a long Ac|count of him&s;elf and his Family, which, in order to under&s;tand well the following Inci|dents, I will tran&s;cribe.</P>

<P>_IN the Reign of <HI>Roderic, Hor|wendil</HI> and <HI>Fengo,</HI> Sons of <HI>Gerwendil,</HI> had the Garri&s;on of <HI>Jutland</HI> committed to them by the King. <HI>Horwendil</HI> was the brave&s;t Pirate on the Sea, and for the Fame of his Exploits envied by <HI>Coller,</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who &s;ailed in pur&s;uit of his Rival; they met, they fought, and the King was &s;lain.</P>
<P>The Encounter of the&s;e Heroes, with the extraordinary Manner of their Meeting each other alone in the Rece&s;&s;es of a Wood, with other Circum&s;tances as improbable as any in Romance, are related in the true Stile of &s;uch Writings, by <HI>Saxo-Grammaticus,</HI> in the third Book of his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="240">After the Death of <HI>Coller,</HI> and his Si&s;ter <HI>Selam, Horwendil,</HI> having for three Years given the greate&s;t Proofs of Valour, de&s;tines his rich Spoils and choice Prey for <HI>Roderic,</HI> that he might ri&s;e in his Friend&s;hip. Grown fa|miliar, he obtains his Daughter, <HI>Geruth,</HI> in Marriage, and by her had a Son, <HI>Amleth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fengo,</HI> fired with Envy at his Brother's Happine&s;s, is re&s;olved, by Treachery, to ruin him. So that Virtue is not always &s;ecure a|gain&s;t the De&s;igns of &s;uch as are the neare&s;t to, and the mo&s;t intimate with us. For when an Opportunity offered to commit Fratricide, he with bloody Hand &s;atiates the dire Lu&s;t of his Heart, poi&s;oned with Envy; and enjoying the Wife of his murdered Brother, adds foul Ince&s;t to his Fratricide. He who &s;ubmits to one Offence too readily offends again, for one Crime is often the Provocation to another.</P>
<P>He contrived this Villany with &s;uch Art and Impudence as to frame an Excu&s;e for his Guilt from counterfeit Benevolence, and give to Fratricide the Colour of Love. <HI>Geruth</HI> was of &s;o mild a Di&s;po&s;ition as never to give the lea&s;t Offence, and yet he &s;aid &s;he had incurred the &s;evere&s;t Hatred of her Hu&s;band, and that he had killed his Brother for her &s;ake, and to &s;ave her, thinking it ungenerous &s;o gentle a Lady, and without Gall, &s;hould endure the extream Moro&s;ene&s;s of that Man.</P>
<P>His Succe&s;s was equal to his Wi&s;hes, for Princes may be deceived, and made to believe
<PB N="243" REF="241">
Untruths in Courts where Buffoonery is &s;ome|times favoured, and malicious Detraction ho|noured. <HI>Fengo</HI> he&s;itated not with murderous Hands to embrace a Brother's Wife, and with equal Villany commits a double Impiety.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth</HI> &s;ees this, but that he might not rai&s;e Su&s;picions in his Uncle by an over prudent Care for his own Safety, puts on the Gui&s;e of Folly, and feigns him&s;elf di&s;tracted, and by this Sort of Device he not only covers his De&s;ign, but &s;aves him&s;elf. He lazily &s;tretch|ed him&s;elf out every Day before his Mother's Hearth, rolling on the Ground, and covering him&s;elf with Filth; his Face di&s;coloured and be&s;meared with Gore and Na&s;tine&s;s, pre&s;ented the ridiculous Extravagance of a Natural. Whatever he &s;aid was like the Ravings of a Madman; whatever Action he performed &s;a|voured of extream Ignorance. In &s;hort, you would not &s;ay he was a Man, but a ridiculous Mon&s;ter, produced by Fortune in a Frenzy.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;itting by the Fire, and raking the Embers with his Hand, he would make wooden Hooks, and harden them in the Fire, and fa&s;ten the Ends within one another, that they might hold more firmly together; and when a&s;ked what he was about, would &s;ay he made &s;harp Spikes to revenge his Father.</P>
<P>He was not a little laughed at for this An|&s;wer. The Vanity of &s;uch a ridiculous Per|formance was treated with Contempt by all,
<PB N="244" REF="242">
though it afterwards was of U&s;e to him in the Pro&s;ecution of his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>This Ingenuity gave to tho&s;e of better Judg|ment the fir&s;t Su&s;picion of his Subtilty. The latent Ability of the Workman for greater Matters was &s;een by his Skill in le&s;&s;er ones. Nor could it be thought that his Sen&s;es were impaired, who by the Work of his Hands di&s;covered &s;uch ingenious Artifice. Be&s;ides, he pre&s;erved his Heap of Brands that he had burnt at the Points to make them hard with the greate&s;t Care.</P>
<P>There were tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;erting that he was of uncommon Strength and Quickne&s;s of Parts, that he hid his good Sen&s;e under the Pretence of Folly, and covered the deep De|&s;ign of his Mind with crafty Invention, and that his Advice could not be more readily di&s;|covered than by introducing to him at any Time in his Rece&s;&s;es a beautiful Woman, who might call forth his Mind to the Allure|ments of Love.</P>
<P>So prone is Nature to the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, that no Artifice can di&s;gui&s;e it, and it is too violent to be interrupted by Policy. And therefore, if his Ignorance were counterfeit he would, when Occa&s;ion offered, yield Obe|dience to the Power of Love.</P>
<P>Certain Companions therefore are employ|ed, who &s;hould engage him to ride to di&s;tant
<PB N="245" REF="243">
Parts of the Fore&s;t, and try him with that Temptation.</P>
<P>Among&s;t them there happened to be a Youth, who had the &s;ame Nur&s;e with <HI>Amleth,</HI> and &s;till pre&s;erved in his Heart the Regard that naturally ari&s;es in tho&s;e who are brought up together.</P>
<P>He preferring the Remembrance of former Fellow&s;hip to the pre&s;ent Charge, attends up|on <HI>Amleth,</HI> with the re&s;t of his appointed Comrades, with a Purpo&s;e to inform rather than betray him; which he could not doubt would happen at la&s;t if he di&s;covered the lea&s;t Sign of a &s;ound Mind, and e&s;pecially if he &s;hould openly indulge the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love.</P>
<P>Which was no Secret to <HI>Amleth</HI> him&s;elf; for when commanded to get on Hor&s;eback he purpo&s;ely &s;eats him&s;elf &s;o as to turn his Back to the Hor&s;e's Head, and face his Tail, to which he began to apply the Bridle, as if he was by that Part to govern the Speed of his Hor&s;e. By means of this Contrivance he baffles the De&s;ign of his Uncle, and defeats his Arts. It was very ridiculous to &s;ee the Hor&s;e go forward without the u&s;ual Check of the Reins, the Rider directing only the Tail.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth</HI> in the Way met with a Wolf a|mong&s;t the Trees; his Companions &s;aying they had met with a young Hor&s;e, he replied there were few &s;uch in <HI>Fengo</HI>'s Troops; by
<PB N="246" REF="244">
this mode&s;t and witty Prevarication he rallied the Riches of his Uncle.</P>
<P>When they added that he had made a &s;en&s;i|ble An&s;wer; he affirmed that he intended that he might &s;o to do, not in any Degree &s;eem to favour a Fal&s;hood. For de&s;iring to be thought incapable of lying, he blended Craft and Truth together that he might not &s;eem entirely to de|viate from Veracity in whatever he &s;aid, nor di&s;cover the Richne&s;s of his Parts by too much Exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing along the Shore, when his Compa|nions found the Rudder of a &s;hip-wrecked Ve&s;&s;el, they &s;aid they had found a Knife of prodigious Size: It is therefore fit, &s;ays he, to cut up a large Ham, meaning the Sea in|deed, to which the Size of the Rudder did well agree. Pa&s;&s;ing al&s;o by the &s;andy Clifts, and being directed to look upon the Beach, as if it were Corn, he &s;aid the &s;ame was ground by the foaming Billows of the Sea. This An&s;wer being commended by his Attendant, be a&s;&s;ured them it was di&s;creetly &s;aid by him.</P>
<P>Being left by them on Purpo&s;e, that he might with greater Freedom indulge his Lu&s;t, in a private Place he meets a Girl, &s;ent by his Uncle, as if it were by Chance, and would have lain with her, had not the Fo&s;ter-bro|ther warned him of the Snare by a &s;ecret kind of Information.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="245">For he, con&s;idering how he might be&s;t di&s;|charge the Office of an unknown Monitor to his Friend, and prevent the Danger of his wanton Appetite, fixed a Straw he found on the Ground in the Tail of a Buzze, or Bee, flying by, and drove him towards the Place where he knew <HI>Amleth</HI> was. By this Act he conferred the greate&s;t Benefit on the unguard|ed Youth.</P>
<P>Nor was this Notice more cunningly con|veyed than readily under&s;tood; for <HI>Amleth</HI> &s;ee|ing the Fly, and the Straw that he carried in his Tail, and having carefully con&s;idered it to be a tacit Admonition to beware of Frauds: Alarmed therefore with the Su&s;picion of inju|rious De&s;igns again&s;t him, that he might more &s;ecurely indulge his Wi&s;hes, he catch|ing the Girl in his Arms, carries her a con&s;i|derable Di&s;tance into a Mar&s;h, and unfre|quented, and after Enjoyment earne&s;tly in|treats her not to declare it to any one.</P>
<P>With equal Concern therefore is Silence urged and obtained. For their being brought up together under the &s;ame Guardians from their Infancy, produced the greate&s;t Famili|arity between her and <HI>Amleth.</HI></P>
<P>Upon his Return home, being a&s;ked by every one whether he had gratified his Lu&s;t, he owned he had lain with the Girl. Being a&s;ked again in what Place he had done it, or what Pillow he had u&s;ed, an&s;wered, The Hoof
<PB N="248" REF="246">
of an Animal that carries a Burthen, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Oe&s;trus or Oe&s;trum has a double Signification, either a Gad-bee as above, or a Coxcomb, as in this Place.</NOTE> the Comb of a Cock, and under an arched Roof. He had put all the&s;e Particulars, when under Trial, that he might avoid the telling a Lie. This Account excited much Laughter in tho&s;e about him, although, for the Je&s;t &s;ake, he did not dimini&s;h any Thing of the Truth.</P>
<P>The Girl al&s;o being que&s;tioned (kept her Word with him) and declared he had done no|thing. Credit is given her, and the rather, as it appeared that his Guards knew nothing of the matter. Then he who had marked the Buzze for a Token, to &s;hew that the Safety of <HI>Amleth</HI> was owing to his Conceit, &s;aid that he was lately the only one who took Care of him, and that the young Man's An|&s;wer was to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor was the Merit of the Token forgot: he related how he &s;aw the little Carrier of the Straw with ha&s;ty Flight pa&s;&s;ing near him, and that the Straw was &s;tuck in the hinder Parts of his Body. As this Relation excited greater Laughter in the re&s;t, the Friend of <HI>Amleth</HI> was no le&s;s delighted with his Pru|dence.</P>
<P>All of them being defeated, and unable to gain Admittance into the Secrets of this young Man's Stratagems; one of the Friends of <HI>Fengo,</HI> more pre&s;umptuous than politic, deni|ed
<PB N="249" REF="247">
that this unextricable Scheme of Subtilty could be unravelled by common Artifice; for he was too ob&s;tinate to be moved by Trials of little Moment: An ordinary manner of Trial would not reach &s;uch Variety of Craft. But he had di&s;covered by &s;uperior Sagacity a more &s;ubtle Manner of trying him, not improper for Execution, but mo&s;t effectual for the Di&s;|covery of the Thing propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Scheme was this, "That <HI>Fengo</HI> &s;hould under the Pretence of Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Con|&s;equence withdraw him&s;elf, and <HI>Amleth</HI> be &s;hut up with his Mother alone in her Apartment, Care being taken to have a Man, who un|known to either of them, &s;hould be placed in &s;ome &s;ecret Part of the Room un&s;een, to hear attentively whatever pa&s;&s;ed in Conver&s;a|tion between them. For if the Son was really in his Sen&s;es he would have no Difficul|ty in &s;peaking freely to a Mother's Ear, nor mi&s;tru&s;t the Fidelity of her that bore him. And that he might not &s;eem more forward to advi&s;e than ready to execute, he de&s;ired him|&s;elf to be the Spy.</P>
<P><HI>Fengo</HI> approved the Scheme, and &s;ets out with the Pretence of taking a long Journey.</P>
<P>Mean while the Projector having privately &s;tole to the Chamber where <HI>Amleth</HI> and his Mother were, lay hid under the Matt of the Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="248">But <HI>Amleth</HI> was not the Dupe of this Trea|chery. For &s;u&s;pecting that he might be over|heard by &s;ome officious Li&s;tener, he has at fir&s;t Recour&s;e to his accu&s;tomed Folly, and imitates the crowing of a Cock, and flapping his Arms as if they were Wings, he jumps up and down upon the Bed to try if any Thing lay hid there. And when he found a Ma&s;s under his Feet he examined the Place with his Sword, and &s;tabs the Man who was under|neath, and dragging him forth put him to Death. Cutting the Body in Pieces, he boils them, and pours them out through the Sewer to be devoured by the Hogs.</P>
<P>And thus was the mi&s;erable Body rendered undi&s;tingui&s;hable from the Dung of the Stye.</P>
<P>Having e&s;caped this Snare, he returns to his Mother's Apartment, and when &s;he with great Lamentation and Tears began to bemoan the want of Under&s;tanding in her Son now pre&s;ent, "Why; O! wor&s;t of Women, &s;ays he, do&s;t thou endeavour to di&s;gui&s;e the foule&s;t Crime under a fal&s;e Species of Wailing? Thou, who &s;porting with the Wantonne&s;s of a Strum|pet, and yielding to the vile and impious Condition of your &s;econd Marriage, embrace in your ince&s;tuous Bo&s;om the Murderer of your Hu&s;band, and fawn upon, and plea&s;e with lewde&s;t Tran&s;port the very Man who put to death the Father of your Offspring; &s;o Mares are coupled with Hor&s;es that &s;ubdued their Foremates. It is for Bea&s;ts alone to be
<PB N="251" REF="249">
dragged to any, and to every Male. By this Example it appears that you have lo&s;t all Memory of your former Hu&s;band. It is not without Rea&s;on that I bear the Re&s;emblance of a Fool; for I cannot doubt that he who could de&s;troy a Brother would with like Cruelty rage again&s;t his other Kindred. It is &s;afer to wear the Garb of Folly than of Sen&s;e, and I mu&s;t borrow a Safeguard from the lowe&s;t Species of Madne&s;s. Yet the Care of revenging my Father is ever pre&s;ent to my Mind, but I wait for Times and Sea&s;ons. The &s;ame Place &s;uits not with every Scene or Purpo&s;e again&s;t a dark and cruel Mind, much Thought is re|qui&s;ite. But for you to lament my Madne&s;s is vain, when you ought rather to deplore your own Infamy; you &s;hould therefore not lament another's but your own Failing, for the re&s;t be on your Guard and keep the &s;tricte&s;t Silence. By &s;uch Reproach did he endeavour to recall his Heart-rent Mother to the Practice of for|mer Habits of Virtue, and to teach her to prefer the former Flames of cha&s;ter Love to the pre&s;ent criminal Tran&s;ports."</P>
<P><HI>Fengo</HI> returns, and of every one, and every where enquires for his injudicious Spy; but he is no more to be found, nor does any one re|member to have &s;een him. <HI>Amleth,</HI> in je&s;t, is a&s;ked whether he could di&s;cover any Tracts of him; and replies, "that he went in at the Sewer, fell to the Bo&s;tom, was kept down by the Mud, and devoured by the Hogs, who thronged to the Draught." Which Declara|tion,
<PB N="252" REF="250">
though true, &s;eeming idle and fooli&s;h, was treated as ridiculous.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fengo</HI> no longer doubted of the Sub|tilty of his Son-in-law, he re&s;olved to de&s;troy him, but was afraid to execute his Purpo&s;e on account of his Grandfather, <HI>Roderic,</HI> and the Di&s;plea&s;ure of his own Wife. To cover his Guilt by the Service of another, he purpo&s;es to have him de&s;troyed by means of the King of <HI>Britain.</HI> Thus de&s;irous of con|cealing his Cruelty, he chu&s;es rather to pol|lute his Friend than to be thought infamous him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth,</HI> departing in &s;ecret, directs his Mother to furni&s;h the Hall with Hangings well knotted together, and at the Expiration of a Year to report him dead, and celebrate his funeral Ob&s;equies, and at that very time he promi&s;es to return.</P>
<P>He is attended by two of <HI>Fengo</HI>'s Officers, bearing Letters in&s;cribed on Wood (for that was once a famous Manner of Writing) by which it was given in Charge to the King of <HI>Britain</HI> to de&s;troy the young Man that was &s;ent to him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Officers &s;lept, <HI>Amleth</HI> examin|ing their Baggage di&s;covers the&s;e Tablets; having read them, he rubs out what was writ|ten therein, and in&s;erting other Characters, changes the Tenor of the Mandate from his own De&s;truction to the Death of his At|tendants.
<PB N="253" REF="251">
Nor &s;atisfied with this Alteration, whereby he &s;aves his own Life and expo&s;es that of his Guards, he adds, as the earne&s;t Entreaty of <HI>Fengo,</HI> that the King of <HI>Britain</HI> would be|&s;tow his Daughter in Marriage upon that Youth he had &s;ent him, who was mo&s;t wi&s;e and prudent.</P>
<P>When they came to <HI>Britain</HI> the Envoys waited on the King, and pre&s;ented the In|&s;trument for their own De&s;truction, though they thought it threatned not them but their Companion.</P>
<P>The King, taking no Notice to them of the In&s;tructions delivered him, entertains them with great Magnificence and Ho&s;pitality, when <HI>Amleth,</HI> de&s;pi&s;ing the Splendor of the royal Tables as if they contained but common Food, ab&s;tains in a &s;urpri&s;ing Manner from the riche&s;t Exhibition of Dainties, both in Meats and Drinks.</P>
<P>All admired that a Youth of foreign Ex|tract &s;hould nau&s;eate the choice&s;t Dainties of the royal Board and mo&s;t excellent Luxury, as if it were coar&s;e and homely Fare.</P>
<P>The Banquet ended, the King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his Friends that they might retire to Re&s;t, but took Care, by one &s;ent privately and hid in their Apartments, to be informed of the Con|ver&s;ation of his Gue&s;ts. When <HI>Amleth</HI> be|ing a&s;ked by his Comrades why he ab&s;tained from the Entertainment of Ye&s;terday as from
<PB N="254" REF="252">
Poi&s;on? "replied that the Bread was &s;prinkled with the Contagion of Blood, that the Wine ta&s;ted of the Sword, that the animal Food &s;avoured of the Corp&s;e of a dead Man, and was as offen&s;ive as the Smell of a Sepulchre."</P>
<P>He added "that the King had mean Eyes, that the Queen in three In&s;tances re&s;embled a Servant;" railing not only at the Fea&s;t but at the Authors of it.</P>
<P>His Companions, upbraiding him with his former want of Under&s;tanding, began to abu&s;e him for having found Fault with approv|ed good Things, blamed what was proper, and &s;landered with indecent Language a great King, and a Queen of refined Manners, and treated with Di&s;grace and Indignity tho&s;e who really de&s;erved Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Which Circum&s;tances being related to the King by his Officer, he declared the Wi&s;dom or Madne&s;s of him who had related &s;uch Things of more than mortal Growth in &s;o few Words to &s;hew &s;uch Extent of Know|ledge. He &s;ent for the Steward, and enquir|ed of him where he had the Bread, and when he was told that it was made by the Baker to the Hou&s;hold, he a&s;ked again where the Corn grew, and if there was any Sign of human Slaughter in that Place?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered "that there was a Field not far off covered with the Bones of Men long &s;ince &s;lain, yet manife&s;tly exhibiting the Remains
<PB N="255" REF="253">
of ancient Slaughter, which he, with Expec|tation of greater Plenty, as the richer Soil had &s;own with Spring Corn, and therefore he did not know whether the Bread might not have contracted a di&s;agreeable Ta&s;te."</P>
<P>When the King heard this, believing <HI>Amleth</HI> had &s;poken Truth, he took Care to know whence the Bacon came.</P>
<P>The Man owned that the Swine, &s;traying from his Care, had fed upon the Carca&s;e of a Thief, and &s;o perhaps the Meat might ta&s;te &s;omething like Corruption.</P>
<P>When the King found that his Opinion was true, demanded in this In&s;taece likewi&s;e with what Liquor he had mixed the Drink? as he knew it to be made of Corn and Water; the Situation of the Spring being &s;hewn him he &s;et about digging, and found many Swords eaten with Ru&s;t, from whence he &s;uppo&s;ed the Water had contracted that Smell.</P>
<P>Others &s;aid the Drink was found fault with becau&s;e in the Draught he had met with Bees that had been bred in the Belly of a dead Man, and ta&s;ted of Comb. By which the King, &s;eeing there was &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to complain of the Ta&s;te of the&s;e Things, finding that he him&s;elf was reproached on account of his Eyes, and knowing that this mu&s;t allude to Ba&s;ene&s;s of Birth, taking his Mother a&s;ide, de|manded of her who was his Father, &s;he de|claring &s;he knew no other than the King, by
<PB N="256" REF="254">
threatning her with Death unle&s;s &s;he confe&s;&s;ed; he di&s;covered him&s;elf to be the Son of a Servant.</P>
<P>Thus by the extorted Confe&s;&s;ion he came to under&s;tand that his Origin, which had been reflected on, was at lea&s;t ambiguous. He is confounded with Shame at this Di&s;covery of his Condition, but no le&s;s charmed with the young Man's Wi&s;dom; and a&s;ked him why he had reproachfully &s;lurred the Queen as one of &s;ervile Manners? But whil&s;t he laments that the gentle Di&s;po&s;ition of his Wife was attack|ed by the Di&s;cour&s;e of his Gue&s;t in the Night, he learns that her Mother was a waiting Wo|man; and whereas he &s;aid &s;he exhibited three Defects of a &s;ervile Nature, they are the&s;e. One, "that &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her Head in the &s;ame Manner as Servants do, another, that &s;he tucked up her Gown in walking, the third was, that &s;he picked her Teeth with a Skewer, and eat the Pickings of them. He took No|tice that her Mother was reduced to Servitude by becoming a Captive, &s;o that &s;he was not le&s;s &s;ervile in her Birth than her Manners."</P>
<P>Such Sagacity being reverenced by the King, as if it were divine, he gave him his Daughter in Marriage, and received his Affir|mation of any Thing as if it bore the Te&s;ti|mony of Heaven. But as for his Compani|ons, that he might perform the Behe&s;t of his Friends, he hanged them up the next Day, which, though an Advantage, <HI>Amleth</HI> &s;eemed to re&s;ent as an Injury, feigning a Di&s;tre&s;s of Mind, and received Money by way of Com|po&s;ition
<PB N="257" REF="255">
from the King; which he afterwards took Care &s;ecretly to melt down and pour in|to hollow Staves.</P>
<P>Having &s;tay'd with him a Year, he obtains Leave to depart, and returns home again, taking nothing out of the Magazine of royal Trea&s;ure but the hollow Staves, in which he had poured the Gold. When he arrived at <HI>Jutland,</HI> he re&s;umed his old Behaviour, chang|ing his late Elegance for the ridiculous Man|ner he had before employed. And when he entered the Hall, covered with Na&s;tine&s;s, where the Funeral Rites were celebrated, he threw every body into great Amazement, be|cau&s;e a fal&s;e Report had been &s;pread of his Death. At length their A&s;toni&s;hment was turned into Laughter, and the Gue&s;ts rallied each other upon the Pre&s;ence of him alive, to whom they had performed Honours as dead.</P>
<P>When que&s;tioned concerning his Compani|ons, he &s;aid, &s;hewing the Staves he held, "Here is both the one and the other;" which was &s;aid with equal Wit and Truth, for though it ap|peared an unmeaning Speech to mo&s;t who heard it, yet &s;werved not from his cu&s;tomary regard to Truth, &s;hewing the Compen&s;ation in&s;tead of the Men that were executed.</P>
<P>Then mixing with the Waiters, that he might heighten the Mirth of the Table, he &s;upplied them with Liquor with more than or|dinary Diligence, and that his flowing Habit might not ob&s;truct his moving up and down,
<PB N="258" REF="256">
he girt it round him with his Belt, and often with De&s;ign, drawing his Sword, he cut his Fingers with the Point; Care therefore was taken by tho&s;e about him to fa&s;ten his Sword in the Scabbard with a Nail.</P>
<P>That he might the more &s;ecurely effect his Purpo&s;e he charged the Nobility with Exce&s;s of Liquor, till all were overcame with Drink|ing, and, unable to walk, were obliged to take up their Re&s;t in the Hall, and &s;leep where they had been fea&s;ting. And when he ob&s;erved them in a Condition fit for his De&s;igns, be|lieving the Execution of it was in his Power, he puts the Brands he had formerly prepared into his Bo&s;om, and then re-entering the Hall where the Nobles lay &s;tretched on the Ground, oppre&s;&s;ed with Sleep and Surfeit, he let fall the Curtain his Mother had wove, by cut|ting the Lines that held it round the &s;ides of the Room, which he drew over them, and fa&s;tened with the Hooks in &s;o artful a Manner, that not one of them, though he &s;trove with never &s;o much Strength, could po&s;&s;ibly get up.</P>
<P>After this he &s;ets fire to the Room, which &s;preading far and wide, &s;oon &s;et the whole Hou&s;e in a Blaze, de&s;troyed the Palace, and burnt all, both tho&s;e that continued a&s;leep, and tho&s;e who laboured to ri&s;e but in vain. Thence ha&s;ting to <HI>Fengo</HI>'s Apartment, who had been before conducted thither by his Attendants, he took his Sword that hung
<PB N="259" REF="257">
by his Bed, and put his own in its room; then rou&s;ing his Uncle, he told him that his Nobles were de&s;troyed by Fire, that <HI>Amleth</HI> was there, and furni&s;hed with the Hooks he had formerly made, and was now pre&s;ent with him eager to inflict the Venge|ance due for his Father's Death.</P>
<P>On hearing this, <HI>Fengo</HI> jumps from his Bed, and was murdered, while di&s;appointed of his own he vainly endeavours to draw <HI>Amleth</HI>'s Sword. O! brave Man! and worthy everla&s;t|ing Renown, who, furni&s;hing him&s;elf wi&s;ely with counterfeit Folly, covered more than human Wi&s;dom under the Gui&s;e of a Na|tural, not only &s;ecured his own Safety by that Artifice, but obtained the Means of compleatly revenging his Father, and having &s;o done, it is left for every one to judge which was greater, his Bravery or Wi&s;dom.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Fable of the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>CLAUDIUS,</HI> the reigning King of <HI>Den|mark,</HI> having &s;ecretly murdered his Bro|ther, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of his Throne afterwards, married his Widow; the Gho&s;t of the decea&s;ed King appears to &s;ome Cen|tinels, who were po&s;ted on the Platform before the Palace; the&s;e Soldiers tell <HI>Marcellus,</HI> their Officer, what they had &s;een, and he ac|quainting <HI>Horatio,</HI> the Friend of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> Son to the decea&s;ed King, with it; the&s;e two Gen|tlemen watch one Night on the Platform, with an Intention to &s;peak to the Apparition if it &s;hould appear. The Gho&s;t at the accu&s;tomed Hour appears. <HI>Horatio</HI> &s;olemnly conjures it to &s;peak, and unfold the Cau&s;e of its Appearance, but the Gho&s;t continues &s;ilent and &s;talks away.</P>
<P><HI>Horatio</HI> thereupon re&s;olves to tell <HI>Hamlet</HI> what had happened; the Prince, full of Grief
<PB N="262" REF="260">
for his Father's Death, di&s;plea&s;ed at his Mo|ther's ince&s;tuous Marriage, and di&s;contented with the Behaviour of his Uncle, immediately concludes from this Account of his Father's Spirit appearing that all was not well, and de|clares to his two Friends that he will watch with them that Night on the Platform, and &s;peak to the Spirit.</P>
<P>Accordingly at Midnight he meets them at the appointed Place, and the Gho&s;t &s;oon after appearing, <HI>Hamlet</HI> in a mo&s;t earne&s;t and af|fecting Manner conjures it to &s;peak, and ac|quaint him with the Cau&s;e of its appearing. The Gho&s;t beckens him to follow it; his Companions, apprehending &s;ome Danger might happen to his Per&s;on, endeavour to re|tain him, hut in vain, <HI>Hamlet</HI> breaks from them and follows the Gho&s;t, who bringing him to a remote Place declares that he is the Spirit of his Father, that he was poi&s;oned in his Garden by his Brother, who lu&s;ted for his Wife and Crown; he then charges him to re|venge his Murder, and vani&s;hes.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> vows to fulfil his Commands, and to conceal the Grief and Indignation which prey upon his Heart, and his vowed Purpo&s;e of Revenge, counterfeits Madne&s;s; which alarm|ing the guilty King, and troubling his Mother, they &s;end for two of his School-fellows to a|mu&s;e him, and engage him in Diver&s;ions to abate the Force of his Melancholy.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="261"><HI>Polonius,</HI> an old Lord, very faithful to the King's Intere&s;ts, and who&s;e Daughter, <HI>Ophelia, Hamlet</HI> is in Love with; from her Report of a frantic Vi&s;it he made her, con|cludes he is mad for her; &s;he having, accord|ing to his Orders, returned his Letters and Pre&s;ents, and refu&s;ed to hear his Profe&s;&s;ions as u&s;ual. <HI>Pollonius,</HI> having as he thought di&s;|covered the Cau&s;e of <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Madne&s;s, ac|quaints the King and Queen with his Su&s;pici|ons: <HI>Ophelia</HI> is de&s;ignedly thrown in his way, while the King and <HI>Polonius</HI> conceal them|&s;eves to hear their Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet,</HI> after uttering a great many &s;en&s;ible Extravagancies, leaves <HI>Ophelia</HI> firmly con|vinced of his Madne&s;s, which &s;he affection|ately deplores; but the King, who had heard all his Di&s;cour&s;e, being per&s;uaded that Love was not the Cau&s;e of his Melancholy, and that there might be Danger in it, re&s;olves to &s;end him to <HI>England</HI> to demand the Tribute, the Payment of the Tribute which had been long neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Polonius,</HI> to whom he communicates this Scheme, approves of it, but advi&s;es that the Queen &s;hould fir&s;t &s;end for him, and in a pri|vate Conver&s;ation intreat him to di&s;cover the Cau&s;e of his Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The King con&s;ents, mean Time <HI>Hamlet</HI> having engaged &s;ome Players to repre&s;ent a Piece &s;omething like the Murder of his Father,
<PB N="264" REF="262">
invites the King and Queen to the Play; and he doubting that the Spirit that appeared to him might be a lying Spirit, re&s;oves to make the Play the Te&s;t of the King's Con&s;cience; he therefore de&s;ires his Friend, <HI>Horatio,</HI> to join with him in carefully ob&s;erving the King's Countenance during the Repre&s;entation of one particular Scene, which re&s;embles the Circum&s;tance of his Father's Death, adding,
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;If his occult Guilt</L>
<L>Do not it&s;elf unkennel in one Speech,</L>
<L>It it a damned Gho&s;t that we have &s;een.</L></Q></P>
<P>Accordingly the King is &s;o much &s;truck with that Scene that he ri&s;es abruptly and goes out, by which <HI>Hamlet</HI> is convinced that the Gho&s;t had told him nothing but Truth. The Queen then &s;ends for <HI>Hamlet</HI> with an Intention to que&s;tion him concerning his late Behaviour, and <HI>Polonius,</HI> with her Con&s;ent, conceals him&s;elf behind the Arras to hear their Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Queen being frighted at her Son's rude Treatment of her, cries out for Help, <HI>Po|lonius</HI> behind the Arras echoes her, and <HI>Hamlet,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing it was the King who had concealed him&s;elf there, kills him.</P>
<P>After a &s;evere Lecture to his Mother, he charges her not to di&s;cover that his Madne&s;s is feigned, declares that he &s;u&s;pects &s;ome Trea&s;on in the Emba&s;&s;y he is &s;ent on to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="263">
yet re&s;olves to go, and madly takes Leave of the King and her for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Ophelia,</HI> at the News of her Father's being murdered by <HI>Hamlet,</HI> grows di&s;tracted; her Brother, <HI>Laertes,</HI> fired by Rage and Grief, rai&s;es a Mutiny to revenge his Father. The King declares that he is innocent of his Fa|ther's Death, informs him of the Manner of it, and joins with him in con&s;piring the Mur|der of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hamlet,</HI> &s;u&s;pecting the Letters his two Schoolfellows carried to <HI>England</HI> contained &s;ome dangerous In&s;tructions concerning him|&s;elf, &s;teals them, and upon examining them finds therein an earne&s;t Reque&s;t from his Uncle to the King of <HI>England,</HI> to put him to Death on his Arrival at his Court.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;es this Letter, and writes another in the Name of his Uncle to the &s;ame King, in which he de&s;ires him to put the Bearers of that Letter to Death; this Packet he lays in the Place from whence he had taken the other.</P>
<P>The next Day they are attacked by a Py|rate, they fight, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> boarding it alone, is taken Pri&s;oner, and his two Companions continue their Voyage to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> prevails upon the Pirates to land him in <HI>Denmark</HI>; the King hearing of his Re|turn, urges <HI>Laertes,</HI> who breathes nothing but
<PB N="266" REF="264">
Revenge again&s;t him, to kill him treacherou&s;|ly as they are fencing with Foils, to which he will engage him, by pretending to lay a Wa|ger on his &s;uperior Skill at that Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Laertes</HI> con&s;ents, and adds that he will anoint the Point of his Sword with a &s;trong Poi&s;on, that if he draws Blood he may be &s;ure to kill him.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the di&s;tracted <HI>Ophelia</HI> is accidentally drowned; the King, the Queen, and her Brother attend her Funeral: As &s;oon as &s;he is laid in the Earth, <HI>Laertes,</HI> in a Tran|&s;port of Grief, leaps into her Grave. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> under&s;tanding that it is <HI>Ophelia</HI> whom they had buried, wildly a&s;&s;erting his Claim as a Lover to &s;uperior Sorrow, leaps into the Grave like|wi&s;e, where <HI>Laertes,</HI> quite overcome with Rage and Grief, furiou&s;ly fa&s;tens on him; they are with Difficulty parted by the King's Command, and &s;ome time after the King, as if nothing had happened, &s;ends a Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Hamlet,</HI> reque&s;ting him to fence with <HI>Laertes</HI> for a con&s;iderable Wager; <HI>Hamlet</HI> obeys, they meet in a Hall, the King and Queen be|ing pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The King, to make &s;ure Work, after drinking <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Health, poi&s;ons the Wine, and offers the Cup to <HI>Hamlet</HI>; he refu&s;es it, and the Queen, not knowing that the Wine is poi&s;oned, drinks, though the King endea|vours to prevent her. <HI>Laertes</HI> wounds <HI>Ham|let</HI> with the poi&s;oned Rapier, in the Scuffle
<PB N="267" REF="265">
they change Weapons, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> wounds <HI>Laertes,</HI> they both bleed; the Queen is &s;eiz|ed with the Agonies of Death, &s;he tells her Son that the Wine is poi&s;oned, and expires.</P>
<P><HI>Laertes,</HI> full of Remor&s;e for the Treachery he had been guilty of, confe&s;&s;es the whole Contrivance, and the Part the King had in it. <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;tabs the King with the poi&s;oned Sword that had wounded both him and <HI>Laertes,</HI> and upon the King's calling for Help obliges him to drink of the Wine he had poi&s;oned.</P>
<P>The King dies, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> and <HI>Laertes</HI> exchanging Forgivene&s;s with each other, both expire. <HI>Hamlet</HI> with his la&s;t Breath com|manding his Friend, <HI>Horatio,</HI> who would have killed him&s;elf, to live and do Ju&s;tice to his Fame, by declaring his Story to the World.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lation of the Story of <HI>Amleth</HI> from the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory of <HI>Saxo-Grammati|cus,</HI> I was favoured with by a Friend; the Story it&s;elf is full of ridiculous Fancies, wild and improbable Circum&s;tances, and as it is con|ducted, has more the Appearance of a Ro|mance than an Hi&s;torical Fact.</P>
<P>That <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> founded his <HI>Tragedy of Hamlet</HI> upon it is very plain, but is it uncer|tain whether he &s;aw a literal Tran&s;lation of it, or met with the Incidents dre&s;t up like a Novel, and perhaps with tho&s;e Alterations which he has adopted in his Play. All the principal Circum&s;tances are the &s;ame in the
<PB N="268" REF="266">
Play as the Hi&s;tory. In both a Prince mur|ders his Brother, u&s;urps his Dignity, and marries his Widow: The Son of the mur|dered Prince re&s;olves to revenge his Father; for that Purpo&s;e he feigns him&s;elf mad, and at la&s;t accompli&s;hes his De&s;ign; &s;everal of the le&s;&s;er Circum&s;tances are al&s;o as exactly co|pied, and others have afforded Hints for new ones.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth</HI> has a private Interview with his Mother, and kills the Spy who had been ap|pointed to overhear their Conver&s;ation. <HI>Hamlet</HI> likewi&s;e vi&s;its the Queen in her Apartment, and kills <HI>Polonius,</HI> who had concealed him&s;elf behind the Hangings.</P>
<P>When the Spies are removed the Di&s;cour&s;e of the two Princes is much the &s;ame; they reproach their Mothers with their ince&s;tuous Marriage, &s;harply reprove them for their Crimes declare their Madne&s;s to be feigned, and enjoin them to Secre&s;y.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>England</HI> is de&s;igned after the Hi&s;tory. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> indeed makes <HI>Hamlet,</HI> after two Days Ab&s;ence, be &s;et on &s;hore a|gain at <HI>Denmark;</HI> and <HI>Amleth</HI> in the Hi&s;tory arrives in <HI>England,</HI> has his Companions hang|ed, and marries the King's Daughter before he comes back. But <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plan re|quired the immediate Return of <HI>Hamlet;</HI> however the Contrivance of changing the Let|ters are the &s;ame, and of puni&s;hing the trea|cherous Bearers of them. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes
<PB N="269" REF="267">
tho&s;e Bearers the Schoolfellows, and profe&s;t Friends of <HI>Hamlet;</HI> a Circum&s;tance which heightens their Ba&s;ene&s;s, and ju&s;tifies the Ar|tifice he u&s;es to procure their Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of entrapping <HI>Amleth</HI> by means of a Girl, has not been wholly neglected by <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> though he manages this Incident much more decently. <HI>Ophelia,</HI> with whom he is in Love, is ordered to throw her&s;elf in his way, and the King and his Confident li&s;ten to their Conver&s;ation. 'Tis very ea&s;y to &s;ee he took the Hint of this Stratagem from the Story, though it is very differently conduct|ed, for <HI>Ophelia</HI> is not a loo&s;e Wanton as in the Hi&s;tory, but a Woman of Honour, with whom he is in love. The accidental killing of her Father, and her Di&s;traction, which was cau&s;ed by it, is all his own Invention, and would have made a very affecting Epi&s;ode if the Lady had been more mode&s;t in her Frenzy, and the Lover more uniformly af|flicted for her Death; for at his fir&s;t hearing it he expre&s;&s;es only a &s;light Emotion; pre|&s;ently he jumps into her Grave, fiercely de|mands to be buried with her, fights with her Brother for profe&s;&s;ing to love her, then grows calm, and never thinks of her any more.</P>
<P>The Gho&s;t is wholly the Invention of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> as is likewi&s;e the King's concert|ed Scheme with <HI>Laertes,</HI> to kill <HI>Hamlet</HI> trea|cherou&s;ly as they fenced, or if he failed to poi&s;on the Wine. The King is killed by <HI>Hamlet</HI> both in the Hi&s;tory and the Play, but
<PB N="270" REF="268">
in the Play he is &s;tabb'd in the mid&s;t of his Friends, Guards, and Attendants; in the Hi&s;tory as he is ri&s;ing in Confu&s;ion from his Bed, and unable to draw his Sword to defend him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here the Hi&s;torian, romantic as his Relati|on &s;eems, has the Advantage of the Poet in Probability. After <HI>Amleth</HI> has &s;ecured his Uncle's Attendants, taken away his Sword from him, and placed his own, which was fa&s;tened to the Scabbard, in its &s;tead; it was not difficult for him to kill him di&s;armed, and without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes <HI>Hamlet</HI> execute his Vengeance on the King in a public Hall, crouded with his Attendants and Guards, and &s;urrounded by his Friends; none of the&s;e of|fer to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> has lei&s;ure enough after he has &s;tabbed him to make him drink &s;ome of the Wine he had poi&s;oned, le&s;t his Sword had not compleated the Work.</P>
<P>The Queen's Death, by drinking ignorantly of the poi&s;oned Wine is a beautiful Stroke of the Poet's. The Hi&s;tory &s;hews her unfortu|nate, but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes the &s;ame Man who &s;educed her to Wickedne&s;s be her invo|luntary Murderer, and at once the Cau&s;e and Puni&s;her of her Guilt.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has with Rea&s;on been cen&s;ured for the Cata&s;trophe of this Tragedy. The brave, the injured <HI>Hamlet</HI> falls with the Mur|derers
<PB N="271" REF="269">
he puni&s;hes; one Fate overwhelms a|like the innocent and the guilty. In the Hi&s;tory we find he did not live long after the &s;evere Revenge he took for his Father's Mur|der, but was unfortunately killed in Battle. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> would not &s;o far deviate from the Hi&s;tory as to leave him happy and in Peace, though he has ha&s;tened his Death as well as changed the Manner of it. He is killed by the treacherous Contrivance of the King, and <HI>Laertes</HI> is the In&s;trument of that Treachery, which is afterwards turned upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As <HI>Laertes</HI> is a &s;ubordinate Character in the Play, it &s;eems to be a Fault in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to &s;hew him with a Similitude of Manners, under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, and acting up|on the &s;ame Principles as <HI>Hamlet,</HI> his Hero. <HI>Laertes</HI> is brave and generous; his Father is murdered ba&s;ely as he is informed; Duty and Honour incite him to revenge his Death, and he does &s;o.</P>
<P>This Samene&s;s of Character, and Parity of Circum&s;tances with the Hero, le&s;&s;ens his Importance, and almo&s;t divides our Attention and Concern between them; an Effect which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> certainly did not intend to produce, nor can it be le&s;&s;ened by the Con&s;ideration of the treacherous Mea&s;ures <HI>Laertes</HI> was prevail|ed upon to enter into again&s;t <HI>Hamlet,</HI> who had murdered his Father. In this he does not differ much from <HI>Hamlet,</HI> who did not attempt by open Force to revenge his Father's Mur|der
<PB N="272" REF="270">
on his Uncle, but de&s;igned to accompli&s;h it by Subtilty and Craft.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Equality is pre&s;erved in their Deaths, and in their Actions throughout the Play. <HI>Laertes</HI> wounds <HI>Hamlet</HI> with the poi|&s;oned Weapon, in the Scuffle they change Rapiers, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> wounds <HI>Laertes,</HI> and they exchange Forgivene&s;s with each other be|fore they die.</P>
<P>Thus has <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> unde&s;ignedly, no doubt given us two Heroes in&s;tead of one in this Play; the only Difference between them is that one of them is a Prince, the other a No|bleman, and but for this &s;light Di&s;tinction the Play might have been as well called the <HI>Tra|gedy of Laertes</HI> as <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>
<P>It ought to be ob&s;erved that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has not been led into this Error by the Hi&s;tory; the Character of <HI>Laertes,</HI> and all the Circum|&s;tances relating to him is his own, which he has introduced by making the Spy, who is killed, Father of <HI>Laertes.</HI></P>
<P>The Madne&s;s of <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;eems to be le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the Play than the Hi&s;tory; in the latter it affords him the Means of executing a Contrivance, which, ab&s;urd as it is, &s;ecures the Accompli&s;hment of his Revenge; but in the Play it is of no other U&s;e than to enliven the Dialogue, unle&s;s its U&s;efulne&s;s may be de|duced from its bringing on &s;uch Accidents as it was a&s;&s;umed to prevent; for <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Mad|ne&s;s
<PB N="273" REF="271">
alarms the King's Su&s;picion, and that produces the treacherous Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>England,</HI> which failing, the Contrivance of the poi&s;on|ed Rapier followed, and that does the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the King's con&s;cious Guilt and Terror might rea&s;onably have created a Di&s;tru&s;t of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and that Di&s;tru&s;t, and a De&s;ire of Security induced him to &s;eek his Death, what need had <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to make his Heroe's Sen&s;e and Di&s;cretion appear doubtful, by &s;hewing him feigning a Madne&s;s, de&s;tructive to his Safety, and which he him&s;elf knows to be &s;o, and yet per&s;i&s;ts in.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has indeed followed the Hi&s;tory in making <HI>Hamlet</HI> feign him&s;elf mad; but that Madne&s;s being of no Con&s;equence to the prin|cipal De&s;ign of the Play, as it is in the Hi&s;|tory, or if of Con&s;equence it hurts the Repu|tation of his Hero, 'tis certainly a Fault; for at lea&s;t he only produces the &s;ame Events by a Blunder, which might have happened without it.</P>
<P>The Violation of poetical Ju&s;tice is not the only Fault that ari&s;es from the Death of <HI>Hamlet;</HI> the revenging his Father's Murder is the &s;ole End of all his De&s;igns, and the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Play, and the noble and fixed Re&s;olution of <HI>Hamlet</HI> to accompli&s;h it, makes up the mo&s;t &s;hining Part of his Character; yet this great End is delayed till after <HI>Hamlet</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="272">
is mortally wounded: He &s;tabs the King im|mediately upon the Information of his Trea|chery to him&s;elf! thus his Revenge becomes intere&s;ted, and he &s;eems to puni&s;h his Uncle rather for his own Death, than the Murder of the King, his Father.</P>
