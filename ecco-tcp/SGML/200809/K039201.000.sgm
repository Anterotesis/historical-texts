<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was fir&s;t call'd to the Office of Hi&s;toriographer to <HI>John Bull,</HI> he ex|pre&s;s'd him&s;elf to this purpo&s;e: <HI>Sir</HI> Humphry, <HI>I know you are a plain Dealer; it is for that Rea&s;on I have cho&s;en you for this important Tru&s;t; &s;peak the Truth, and &s;pare not.</HI> That I might fulfil tho&s;e his honourable In|tentions, I obtain'd Leave to <HI>repair</HI> to, and at|tend him in his most &s;ecret Retirements; and I put the Journals of all Tran&s;actions into a &s;trong Box, to be open'd at a fitting Occa&s;ion, after the manner of the Hi&s;toriographers of &s;ome Ea&s;tern Monarchs: This I thought was the &s;afest way; tho' I declare I was never afraid to be <HI>chop'd</HI> by my Ma&s;ter for telling of Truth. It is from tho&s;e Journals that my Memoirs are compil'd: There|fore let not Po&s;terity, a thou&s;and Years hence, look for Truth in the voluminous Annals of Pedants, who are entirely ignorant of the &s;ecret Springs of great Actions; if they do, let me tell them, they will be <HI>Nebus'd.</HI> With incredible Pains have I endeavour'd to copy the &s;everal Beauties of the an|cient
<PB REF="3">
and modern Hi&s;torians; the impartial Tem|per of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the Gravity, Au&s;terity, and &s;trict Morals of <HI>Thucidides,</HI> the exten&s;ive Know|ledge of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> the Sublimity and Grandeur of <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> and to avoid the carele&s;s Stile of <HI>Polybius:</HI> I have borrow'd con&s;iderable Orna|ments from <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;eus</HI> and <HI>Dio|dorus Siculus:</HI> The <HI>&s;pecious Gilding</HI> of <HI>Taci|tus</HI> I endeavour'd to &s;hun. <HI>Mariana, Davila,</HI> and <HI>Fra. Paulo,</HI> are tho&s;e amongst the Moderns whom I thought most worthy of Imitation; but I cannot be &s;o di&s;ingenuous, as not to own the infi|nite Obligations I have to the <HI>Pilgrim's Progre&s;s</HI> of <HI>John Bunyan,</HI> and the <HI>Tenter Belly</HI> of the Reverend <HI>Jo&s;eph Hall.</HI> From &s;uch Encourage|ment and Helps, it is ea&s;y to gue&s;s to what a de|gree of Perfection I might have brought this great Work, had it not been nip'd in the Bud by &s;ome illiterate People in both Hou&s;es of Parliament, who envying the great Figure I was to make in future Ages, under Pretence of rai&s;ing Money for the War, have padlock'd all tho&s;e very Pens that were to celebrato the Actions of their Heroes, by &s;ilencing at once the whole &V;niver&s;ity of <HI>Grub|&s;treet.</HI> I am per&s;waded, that nothing but the Pro&s;pect of an approaching Peace could have en|courag'd them to make &s;o bold a &s;tep. But &s;uffer me, in the Name of the rest of the Matriculates of that famous &V;niver&s;ity, to ask them &s;ome plain Que&s;tions: Do they think that Peace will bring along with it the Golden Age? Will there be ne|ver a Dying-Speech of a Traitor? Are <HI>Cethegus</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Sequel of the Hi&s;tory of the Meeting at the <HI>Salutation.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHere, I think, I left <HI>John Bull,</HI> &s;it|ting between <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> and <HI>Lewis Baboon,</HI> with his Arms <HI>a-kimbo,</HI> in great Concern to keep <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Nic.</HI> a&s;un|der. As watchful as he was, <HI>Nic.</HI> found the Means, now and then, to &s;tear a Whi&s;per, and, by a cleanly Conveyance under the Ta|ble, to &s;lip a &s;hort Note into <HI>Lewis</HI>'s hand,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
which <HI>Lewis</HI> as &s;lyly put into <HI>John</HI>'s Pocket, with a Pinch or a Jog, to warn him what he was about. <HI>John</HI> had the Curio&s;ity to retire into a Corner, to peru&s;e the&s;e <HI>Billet deux</HI> of <HI>Nic</HI>'s; wherein he found, that <HI>Nic,</HI> had u&s;ed great Freedoms, both with his Intere&s;t and Reputation. One contained the&s;e words, <HI>Dear</HI> Lewis, <HI>Thou &s;eest clearly that this Block|head can never bring his Matters to bear: Let thee and me talk to night by our &s;elves at the</HI> Ro&s;e, <HI>and I'll give thee Satisfaction.</HI> Another was thus expre&s;s'd; <HI>Friend</HI> Lewis, <HI>Has thy Sen&s;e quite for&s;aken thee, to make</HI> Bull <HI>&s;uch Of|fers? Hold fast, part with nothing, and I will give thee a better Bargain, I'll warrant thee.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ome of his Billets, he told <HI>Lewis</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>John Bull</HI> was under his Guardian&s;hip; that the be&s;t part of his Servants were at his Command; that he could have <HI>John</HI> gagg'd and bound whenever he plea&s;ed, by the People of his own Family."</Q> In all the&s;e Epi&s;tles, Blockhead, Dunce, A&s;s, Cox|comb, were the be&s;t Epithets he gave poor <HI>John:</HI> In others he threatned, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that He, E&s;quire <HI>South,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Trade&s;|men, would lay <HI>Lewis</HI> down upon his Back, beat out his Teeth, if he did not retire immediately, and break up the Meeting.</Q></P>
<P>I fancy I need not tell my Reader, that <HI>John</HI> often chang'd Colour as he read, and that his Fingers itch'd to give <HI>Nic.</HI> a good Slap on the Chops, but he wi&s;ely moderated
<PB N="3" REF="10">
his cholerick Temper: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;av'd this Fellow (quoth he) from the Gallows when he ran away from his la&s;t Ma&s;ter, becau&s;e I thought he was har&s;hly treated; but the Rogue was no fooner &s;afe under my Protection, than he began to lie, pilfer, and &s;teal, like the Devil: When I fir&s;t &s;et him up in a warm Hou&s;e, he had hardly put up his Sign, when he began to debauch my be&s;t Cu|&s;tomers from me: Then it was his con|&s;tant Practice to rob my Fi&s;h-ponds, not only to feed his Family, but to trade with the Fi&s;hmongers: I conniv'd at the Fellow till he began to tell me, that they were his as much as mine: In my Manour of <HI>Ea&s;tcheap,</HI> becau&s;e it lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from my con&s;tant In&s;pection, he broke down my Fences, robb'd my Orchards, and beat my Servants. When I us'd to repri|mand him for his Tricks, he would talk &s;aucily, lye, and brazen it out, as if he had done nothing ami&s;s. Will nothing cure thee of thy Pranks <HI>Nic.</HI> (quoth I?) I &s;hall be forced, &s;ome time or another, to cha&s;ti&s;e thee: The Rogue got up his Cane and threatned me, and was well thwack'd for his Pains: But I think his Behaviour at this time wor&s;t of all; after I have al|mo&s;t drowned my &s;elf, to keep his Head above Water, he would leave me &s;ticking in the Mud, tru&s;ting to his Goodne&s;s to help me out. After I have beggar'd my
<PB N="4" REF="11">
&s;elf with his trouble&s;ome Law-Suit, with a Pox to him, he takes it in mighty Dud|geon becau&s;e I have brought him here to end Matters amicably, and becau&s;e I won't let him make me over, by Deed and Inden|ture, as his lawful Cully; which, to my certain Knowledge, he has attempted &s;e|veral times. But, after all, can&s;t thou ga|ther Grapes from Thorns? <HI>Nic.</HI> does not pretend to be a Gentleman, he is a Trade&s;|man, a &s;elf-&s;eeking Wretch, but how ca|me&s;t thou to bear all this, <HI>John?</HI> The Rea|&s;on is plain; Thou conferre&s;t the Benefits, and he receives them; the fir&s;t produces Love, and the la&s;t Ingratitude: Ah! <HI>Nic. Nic.</HI> thou art a damn'd Dog, that's cer|tain; thou knowe&s;t too well, that I will take care of thee, el&s;e thou would'&s;t not u&s;e me thus: I won't give thee up, it is true; but as true as it is, thou &s;halt not &s;ell me, according to thy laudable Cu&s;tom.</Q>While <HI>John</HI> was deep in this Soliloquy, <HI>Nic.</HI> broke out into the following Prote&s;ta|tion.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I believe every body here pre&s;ent will allow me to be a very ju&s;t and di&s;inte|re&s;ted Per&s;on. My Friend <HI>John Bull</HI> here is very angry with me, for&s;ooth, becau&s;e I won't agree to his fooli&s;h Bargains. Now I declare to all Mankind, I &s;hould be ready
<PB N="5" REF="12">
to &s;acrifice my own Concerns to his Quiet; but the care of his Intere&s;t, and that of the hone&s;t Trade&s;men that are embark'd with us, keeps me from entring into this Com|po&s;ition. What &s;hall become of tho&s;e poor Creatures? The Thoughts of their impen|ding Ruin di&s;turbs my Night's Re&s;t, there|fore I de&s;ire they may &s;peak for them&s;elves. If they are willing to give up this Affair, I &s;han't make two words of it.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>John Bull</HI> begg'd him to lay a&s;ide that immoderate Concern for him; and withal, put him in mind, that the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e Trade&s;men had not &s;at quite &s;o heavy upon him &s;ome Years ago, on a like Occa&s;ion. <HI>Nic.</HI> an&s;wer'd little to that, but immediately pull'd out a Boat&s;wain's Whi&s;tle; upon the fir&s;t Whiff, the Trade&s;men came jumping into the Room, and began to &s;urround <HI>Lewis</HI> like &s;o many yelping Curs about a great Boar, or, to u&s;e a mode&s;ter Simile, like Duns at a great Lord's Leve the Morning he goes into the Country; one pull'd him by the Sleeve, ano|ther by the Skirt, a third hallow'd in his Ear; they began to ask him for all that had been taken from their Forefathers by Stealth, Fraud, Force, or lawful Purcha&s;e; &s;ome ask'd for Manours, others for Acres, that lay con|venient for them; that he would pull down his Fences, level his Ditches; all agreed in one common Demand, that he &s;hould be
<PB N="6" REF="13">
purg'd, &s;weated, vomited, and &s;tarv'd, till be came to a &s;izeable Bulk, like that of his Neighbours; one mode&s;tly ask'd him Leave to call him Brother; <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> demanded two Things, to be his Porter and his Fi&s;hmonger, to keep the Keys of his Gates, and furni&s;h his Kitchen; <HI>John</HI>'s Si&s;ter <HI>Peg</HI> only de&s;ir'd that he would let his Servants &s;ing P&s;alms a Sun|days; &s;ome de&s;cended even to the asking of old Cloaths, Shoes, and Boots, broken Bottles, Tobacco-pipes, and Ends of Candles.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bull</HI> (quoth <HI>Lewis</HI>) you &s;eem to be a Man of &s;ome Breeding; for God's &s;ake u&s;e your Intere&s;t with the&s;e Me&s;&s;icurs, that they wou'd &s;peak but one at once; for if one had a hundred pair of Hands, and as many Tongues, he cannot &s;atisfy them all at this rate. <HI>John</HI> begg'd they might proceed with &s;ome Method; then they &s;top'd all of a &s;ud|den, and would not &s;ay a word. If this be your Play (quoth <HI>John</HI>) that we may not be like a Quaker's dumb Meeting, let us begin &s;ome Diver&s;ion; what d'ye think of Rouly-Pouly, or a Country-Dance? What if we &s;hould have a Match at Football! I am &s;ure we &s;hall never end Matters at this rate.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>D&V;ring this general Ce&s;&s;ation of Talk, what if You and I <HI>Nic.</HI> &s;hould en|quire how Money-matters &s;tand between us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic. Frog.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, I love exact Dealing; and let <HI>Hocus</HI> Audit; he knows how the Money was disburs'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not much for that at pre&s;ent; we'll &s;ettle it between Our&s;elves: Fair and Square <HI>Nic.</HI> keeps Friends together. There have been laid out in this Law-Suit, at one time 36000 Pounds and 40000 Crowns: In &s;ome Ca&s;es I, in others you, bear the greatest proportion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right: I pay three Fifths of the greate&s;t Number, and you pay two Thirds of the le&s;&s;er Number: I think this is Fair and Square as you call it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two Thirds of 36000 Pounds are 24000 Pounds for your Share, and there remains 12000 for mine. Again, Of the 40000 Crowns I pay 24000, which is three Fifths, and you pay only 16000, which is two Fifths; 24000 Crowns make 6000 Pounds, and 16000 Crowns make 4000 Pounds: 12000 and 6000 make 18000: 24000 and 4000 makes 28000. So there are 18000 Pounds to my Share of the Expences, and 28000 to yours.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15">
After <HI>Nic.</HI> had bambouzled <HI>John</HI> a while about the 18000 and the 28000, <HI>John</HI> call'd for Counters; but what with Slight of Hand, and taking from his own Score and, adding to <HI>John</HI>'s, <HI>Nic.</HI> brought the Balance always on his own &s;ide.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, good Friend <HI>Nic.</HI> though I am not quite &s;o nimble in the Fingers, I under&s;tand Cyphering as well as you: I will produce you my Accompts one by one, fairly writ out of my own Books: And here I be|gin with the fir&s;t. You mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I don't pronounce the Law Terms right.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>John Bull</HI> found all his Family in an &V;p|roar at Home.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>NIc. Frog.</HI> who thought of nothing but carrying <HI>John</HI> to the Market, and there di&s;po&s;ing of him as his own proper Goods, was mad to find that <HI>John</HI> thought him&s;elf now of Age to look afer his own Affairs: He re&s;olv'd to traver&s;e this
<PB N="14" REF="21">
new Project, and to make him unea&s;ie in his own Family. He had corrupted or de|&s;uded mo&s;t of his Servants into the extrava|gante&s;t Conceits in the World, that their Ma|&s;ter was run mad, and wore a Dagger in one Pocket, and Poi&s;on in the other; that he had told his Wife and Children to <HI>Lewis,</HI> di&s;in|herited his Heir, and was going to &s;ettle his E&s;tate upon a Pari&s;h Boy; that if they did not look after their Ma&s;ter, he would do &s;ome very mi&s;chievous Thing. When <HI>John</HI> came home he found a more &s;urpri&s;ing Scene than any he had yet met with, and that you will &s;ay was &s;omewhat extraordinary.</P>
<P>He call'd his Cook-maid <HI>Betty</HI> to be&s;peak his Dinner, <HI>Betty</HI> told him, <HI>That &s;he beg'd his Pardon; &s;he could not dre&s;s Dinner till &s;he knew what he intended to do with his Will.</HI> Why <HI>Betty,</HI> For&s;ooth (quoth <HI>John</HI>) thou art not run mad art thou? My Will at pre&s;ent is to have Din|ner: That may be (quoth <HI>Betty</HI>) but my Con|&s;cience won't allow me to dre&s;s it, till I know whither you intend to do righteous Things by your Heir? I am &s;orry for that <HI>Betty</HI> (quoth <HI>John</HI>) I mu&s;t find &s;ome body el&s;e then. Then he call'd <HI>John</HI> the Barber. Before I begin (quoth <HI>John</HI>) I hope your Honour won't be offended, if I ask you whither you intend to after your Will? If you won't give me a po|&s;itive An&s;wer, your Beard may grow down to your Middle, for me. I gad and &s;o it &s;hall (quoth <HI>Bull</HI>) for I will never tru&s;t my Throat
<PB N="15" REF="22">
in &s;uch a mad Fellows Hands. Where's <HI>Dick</HI> the Butler? Look ye (quoth <HI>Dick</HI>) I am very willing to &s;erve you in my Calling, d'ye &s;ee, but there are &s;trange Reports, and plain-deal|ing is be&s;t, d'ye &s;ee. I mu&s;t be &s;atisfied if you intend to leave all to your Nephew, and if <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> is &s;till your Executor, d'ye &s;ee; if you will not &s;atisfie me as to the&s;e Points, d'ye &s;ee, you may drink with the Ducks: And &s;o I will (quoth <HI>John</HI>) rather than keep a But|ler that loves my Heir better than my &s;elf. <HI>Hob</HI> the Shoemaker, and <HI>Pricket</HI> the Taylor told him, they would mo&s;t willingly &s;erve him in their &s;everal Stations, if he would pro|mi&s;e them never to talk with <HI>Lewis Baboon,</HI> and let <HI>Nicolas Frog,</HI> Linnen-draper, manage his Concerns; that they could neither make Shoes nor Cloaths to any that were not in good Corre&s;pondence with their worthy Friend <HI>Nicolas.</HI></P>

<P>It is evident to all that are ver|&s;ed in Hi&s;tory, that there were two <HI>Si&s;ters</HI> that play'd the Whore, two thou&s;and Years ago: Therefore it plainly follows, that it is not lawful for <HI>John Bull</HI> to have any manner
<PB N="17" REF="24">
of Entercour&s;e with <HI>Lewis Baboon.</HI> If it is not lawful for <HI>John Bull</HI> to have any manner of Entercour&s;e (Corre&s;pondence, if you will, that is much the &s;ame thing) then <HI>a Fortiori,</HI> it is much more unlawful for the &s;aid <HI>John</HI> to make over his Wife and Children to the &s;aid <HI>Lewis;</HI> if his Wife and Children are not to be made over, he is not to wear a Dagger and Ratsbane in his <HI>Pockets;</HI> if he wears a Dagger and Ratsbane, it mu&s;t be to do Mi&s;|chief to him&s;elf or &s;ome body el&s;e; if he in|tends to do Mi&s;chief, he ought to be under Guardians, and there is none &s;o fit as my &s;elf and &s;ome other worthy Per&s;ons, who have a Commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e from <HI>Nic.

</SP>
<P>That any of the&s;e Rogues (quoth <HI>John</HI>) &s;hould imagine I am not as much concern'd as they about having my Affairs in a &s;ettled Condition, or that I would wrong my Heir for I know not what. Well <HI>Nic.</HI> I really can|not but applaud thy Diligence, I mu&s;t own

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Lewis Baboon</HI> came to vi&s;it <HI>John Bull,</HI> and what pa&s;s'd between them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Think it is but ingenuous to acquaint the Reader, that this Chapter was not wrote by Sir <HI>Humphry</HI> him&s;elf, but by another very able <HI>Pen</HI> of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Grub&s;treet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> had (by &s;ome good In&s;tructions that was given him by Sir <HI>Roger</HI>) got the better of his Cholerick Temper, and wrought him&s;elf up to a great &s;teadine&s;s of Mind, to pur&s;ue his own Intere&s;t through all Impediments that were thrown in the way; he began to leave off &s;ome of his old Aquaintance, his roaring and bullying about the Streets; he put on a &s;e|rious Air, knit his Brows, and for the time had made a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s in Po|liticks, con&s;idering that he had been kept a &s;tranger to his own Affairs. However, he could not help di&s;covering &s;ome remains of his Nature, when he happen'd to meet with a Foot-Ball, or a Match at Cricket; for which Sir <HI>Roger</HI> was &s;ure to take him to task. <HI>John</HI> was walking about his Room with folded Arms, and a mo&s;t thoughtful Countenance, his Servant brought him Word that one <HI>Lewis</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="26">
<HI>Baboon</HI> below wanted to &s;peak with him. <HI>John</HI> had got an Impre&s;&s;ion that <HI>Lewis</HI> was &s;o deadly a cunning Man, that he was afraid to venture him&s;elf alone with him: At la&s;t he took heart of Grace. <HI>Let him come up</HI> (quoth he) <HI>it is but &s;ticking to my Point, and he can never over-reach me.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lewis Baboon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bull</HI> I will frankly acknowledge, that my Behaviour to my Neighbours has been &s;omewhat uncivil, and I believe you will readily grant me, that I have met with U&s;age accordingly. I was fond of Back-&s;word and Cudgel play from my Youth, and I now bear in my Body many a black and blue Ga&s;h and Scars, God knows. I had as good a Ware-hou&s;e, and as fair Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as any of my Neighbours, tho' I &s;ay it; but a contentious Temper, flattering Servants, and unfortunate Stars, have brought me in|to Circum&s;tances that are not unknown to you. The&s;e my Misfortunes are heighten'd by dome&s;tick Calamities, that I need not re|late. I am a poor old batter'd Fellow, and I would willingly end my Days in Peace: But alas, I &s;ee but &s;mall hopes of that, for every new Circum&s;tance affords an Argument to my Enemies to pur&s;ue their Revenge; for|merly I was to be bang'd becau&s;e I was too Strong, and now becau&s;e I am too Weak to re&s;i&s;t, I am to be brought down when too Rich, and oppre&s;&s;ed when too Poor. <HI>Nic.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I con&s;ider the late ill U&s;age I have met with from you, I was reflecting what it was that could provoke you to it; but upon a narrow In&s;pection into my Con|duct, I can find nothing to reproach my &s;elf with, but too partial a Concern for your Intere&s;t. You no &s;ooner &s;et this Compo&s;ition a-foot, but I was ready to comply, and prevented your very Wi&s;hes; and the Affair might have been ended be|fore now, had it not been for the greater Concerns of <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>South,</HI> and the other poor Creatures, embark'd in the &s;ame Common Cau&s;e, who&s;e Safety touches me to the Quick. You &s;eem'd a little jealous that I bad dealt unfairly with you in Money-mat|ters,
<PB N="24" REF="31">
till it appear'd by your own Ac|counts, that there was &s;omething due to me upon the Ballance. Having nothing to an&s;wer to &s;o plain a Demon&s;tration, you began to complain as if I had been fami|liar with your Reputation; when it is well known, not only I, but the meane&s;t Ser|vant in my Family, talk of you with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect. I have always, as far as in me lies, exhorted your Servants and Tenants to be dutiful; not that I any ways meddle in your dome&s;tick Affairs, which were very unbecoming for me to do. If &s;ome of your Servants expre&s;s their great Concern for you in a manner that is not &s;o very polite, you ought to impute it to their extraordinary Zeal, which de&s;erves a Reward rather than a Reproof. You can|not reproach me for want of Succe&s;s at the <HI>Salutation,</HI> &s;ince I am not Ma&s;ter of the Pa&s;&s;ions and Intere&s;ts of other Folks. I have beggar'd my &s;elf with this Law-Suit, undertaken merely in Complai&s;ance to you; and if you would have had but a little Pa|tience, I had &s;till greater things in Re&s;erve that I intended to have done for you. I hope what I have &s;aid will prevail with you to lay a&s;ide your unrea&s;onable Jealou&s;ies, and that we may have no more Meetings at the <HI>Salutation,</HI> &s;pending our Time and Money to no Purpo&s;e.

My Shirt (quoth he) is near me, but my Skin is nearer: Whil&s;t I take care of the Welfare of other Folks, no body can blame me, to apply a little Bal&s;am to my own Sores. It's a pretty thing, after all, for a Man to do his own Bu&s;ine&s;s: a Man has &s;uch a tender Concern for him&s;elf, there's nothing like it. This is &s;omewhat better, I trow, than for <HI>John Bull</HI> to be &s;tanding in the Market, like a great Dray-hor&s;e, with <HI>Frog</HI>'s Paws upon his Head, <HI>What will ye give me for this Bea&s;t?
