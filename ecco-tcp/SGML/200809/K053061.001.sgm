Oh!

Were I not inexcu&s;ably weak I <HI>&s;hould</HI> do this, but I own you have wounded me: I own that your &s;everal &s;ar|ca&s;ms have gone where you directed them&mdash;into the rece&s;&s;es of my heart. Mo&s;t ungenerous Charles, to inter|pret that action into the mo&s;t mer|cenary meanne&s;s, which, I &s;ummon the great God that in&s;pired it, to witne&s;s, proceeded from principle.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38">No, Sir; my &s;pirits and health (if I may judge of the future, by the pre&s;ent) are <HI>not</HI> likely to be re|&s;tored to me in proportion to the length of my ab&s;ence: nor was the abruptne&s;s of my departure the ef|fort of &s;o much ingenuity as you may be plea&s;ed to imagine.&mdash;</P>
<P>If you are yet capable of doing ju&s;tice, I de&s;ire you to reflect on the various &s;truggles I have at different times had &s;ince the commencement of our connection, upon the point that now carried me for ever from you! Even before I &s;aw the lawful Cleora I &s;hed many a tear, and heaved many a &s;igh at the thought of that injury I was every hour
<PB N="33" REF="39">
committing again&s;t her. Nay, did I not twice before, even in the warme&s;t tran&s;ports of our tenderne&s;s, bring my&s;elf to the re&s;olution of leaving you? You pur&s;ued, per&s;uaded, pre+vailed, and brought me back to guilty plea&s;ures. Seeing the life of Charles bound up in the &s;ociety of Charlotte, I endeavoured again to reconcile my&s;elf to my &s;ituation. I even adopted, in &s;ome degree, the &s;ophi&s;try of your own &s;entiments. I argued, as an apology, the innocence of my intention; the hearty de&s;ire I had to &s;erve your family, the gra|titude I owe to the man, who im|proved my under&s;tanding and a|dorned my manners: and, in &s;hort, I took refuge in a thou&s;and plau|&s;ibilities,
<PB N="34" REF="40">
rather than be torn on the rack of reflection, and leave a &s;o|ciety &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly dear to me.</P>
<P>Au&s;picious to the &s;cheme of for|getfulne&s;s, it was about this time you know, Sir, that we began our ex|cur&s;ions, and took the different tours of England, Ireland, and Scotland. The improvements I made in the cour&s;e of the&s;e journies, the &s;erenity of the &s;ea&s;ons in which they were, for the mo&s;t part, performed, and the attracting benefits of &s;o inge|nious a companion as Charles, &s;u&s;|pended for a while the kneener &s;en&s;e of an illicit connection. Yet, in the very bo&s;om of bli&s;s I was never &s;o dull as not to know that it
<PB N="35" REF="41">
<HI>was</HI> an illicit one; and therefore, proper to be broken. To break it, neverthele&s;s, was far beyond the fee|blene&s;s of my power. The idea of Charles and all his fa&s;cinating qua|lities, mixt with every image, and made the leading feature of every figure that was formed by the &s;oul. In repugnance to the conduct I ought to have pur&s;ued, I called to my aid all the &s;eductions of imagination, and, when <HI>they</HI> failed, I derived the comforts of &s;elf-delu&s;ion, even from the pictures of truth&mdash;Is he not, &s;aid I, indu&s;trious to ju&s;tify my error, while I &s;oothed my pa&s;&s;ion; is he not the man, who took me up in a more than orphan &s;tate, and proved him&s;elf to me a father and a friend?
<PB N="36" REF="42">
Did he not find me a ruined crea|ture&mdash;a poor unfortunate wanderer, who had been ju&s;t de&s;erted by the villain lord, who, taking advantage of &s;implicity had robbed my inno|cence, and turned me unprovided upon the world&mdash;? Ought I not to ble&s;s the accident then that threw me in the way of this affectionate protector? From what irremediable mi&s;ery may he not have &s;aved me? How indefatigable has been his ten|derne&s;s? How a&s;&s;iduous his efforts to &s;upport me? How anxious and unre|mitting his wi&s;hes and labours to place me in a way of &s;upporting my&s;elf, again&s;t that day in which he might want life to exert him&s;elf? Was not this my fir&s;t preceptor?
<PB N="37" REF="43">
Wanting the attentions of a parent, and an early victim to my credulity, did he not find me &s;tepping into the very border of female violation? Was not our fir&s;t interview in the very momentous cri&s;is of a woman's fate; and was I not weeping, in the bitter &s;incerity of my heart, over the pro&s;pects of de&s;truction?</P>
<P>Surrounded by calamities like the&s;e, did not providence direct Charles to &s;ave me, as the guardian angel of an unhappy girl? and has not this very Charles pre&s;erved his friend&s;hip unbroken, and his fidelity con&s;ummate ever &s;ince the day of my deliverance?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="44">Arguments like the&s;e, &s;trongly &s;e|conded by the feelings of my heart, did I frequently exert, till, co|operating with the refinements of your conver&s;ation, and the charm I never failed to find in your enter|taining company, I had almo&s;t brought my&s;elf to believe there was nothing extremely wrong in our in|tercour&s;e.</P>
<P>Lulled, however, by this plea&s;ing lethargy of the &s;en&s;es, and &s;ung to repo&s;e by the &s;yren of tenderne&s;s, I argued my&s;elf into a tran&s;ient &s;e|renity, and indulged the &s;oftne&s;s which I perceived to be &s;o &s;oothing. We compleated our de&s;igns, and returned from our rambles in the
<PB N="39" REF="45">
Engli&s;h nation and its neighbouring countries, in order to vi&s;it together the continent of France. Prepara|tions you know, Sir, were making for our <HI>route</HI> &s;oon after our arrival in London, and the beginning of the next week was fixed for our departure.</P>
<P>In the interim I met with the in|jured Cleora, who told me in the mo&s;t affecting manner, that, though &s;he never wi&s;hed a re-union with you, it would give that peace to her heart which was long lo&s;t, if I would tear my&s;elf from your embraces. Agonized by her pleadings, and &s;tung by the &s;en&s;e of having wronged her, I fell upon my knee, and, &s;olemnly in that &s;itua|tion <HI>engaged</HI> to do what I <HI>have</HI> done.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="46">I have nothing to do with your family differences Charles, nor &s;hall I li&s;ten to the &s;tory of either party. Duty and con&s;cience are both con|cerned in the mea&s;ure I have taken, and I &s;hall not be made to repent of it, even by the &s;everity of your up|braidings. It was, neverthele&s;s, too much de&s;cending from the native dignity of your di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;too un|like the candour of Charles's charac|ter, to &s;uppo&s;e a connection of four years e&s;tabli&s;hment, every day of which produced &s;ome evidence of its &s;incerity, &s;hould be &s;acrificed to the very gro&s;&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es in the fir&s;t week's &s;eparation. A new acquaint|ance! What would you in&s;inuate? To what indelicacy do you allude? I
<PB N="41" REF="47">
have a tear now falling upon that part of your letter, and I wi&s;h it had the power to blot both the &s;enti|ment and the recollection of it out of my memory for ever! With great reluctancy &s;hall I admit any ideas that di&s;grace the elegance of Charles's &s;en&s;ibility. Though duty commands me to quit his protection, my know|ledge of his many eminent virtues, incline me to cheri&s;h his idea, and &s;till love him for his excellencies. I would mo&s;t gladly con&s;ider him as a friend, a corre&s;pondent, and a con|&s;picuous character: and, though we &s;hall never meet again, the &s;en&s;e of my obligations to him, and his own merits, might be a con&s;tant &s;ource of innocent contemplation to me:
<PB N="42" REF="48">
why, Charles will you rob me of &s;o agreeable a refuge, perhaps the greate&s;t the whole world has now to afford me. Do you think Sir, then that I can &s;o &s;oon make a transfer of my affections? can I, think you, in &s;o very &s;hort a &s;pace of time, <HI>command</HI> them from Charles to any accidental object? have I &s;o convenient a heart &mdash;&s;o obedient a ver&s;ality? what do you take me for? but indeed I de|&s;erve it all; &s;he who can bring her|&s;elf to &s;leep upon an un&s;anctified pil|low, four long twelve months, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to perpetrate any thing that is wrong; and therefore I forgive you: although, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve how I &s;hudder, and how the blood runs from my
<PB N="43" REF="49">
heart, at the bare &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;uch perfidy.</P>
<P>Indeed you wrong me; and I can|not bear you to entertain &s;uch ideas: even though by entertaining them your&s;elf, <HI>my</HI> image would be the &s;ooner obliviated. Though you found me a fallen woman, I am not con|&s;titutionally a wretch of purcha&s;e, Sir. Your many amiable le&s;&s;ons of mora|lity have not been &s;o egregiou&s;ly mi&s;|employed. The virtue you have in|culcated, and the volumes you have put into my hand, have produced effects more &s;alutary: nay Charles, it is to your own in&s;tructions &mdash; to your own cultivation of my head and heart, that I have been induced to
<PB N="44" REF="50">
undertake the magnanimity of this action. With re&s;pect to re&s;ources&mdash; &s;uch I mean as are nece&s;&s;ary, merely nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of hu|man life, it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould be de&s;titute of them, while I have health; and the power who encou|raged me to a good action will not, I tru&s;t, &s;uffer the &s;harpne&s;s of pover|ty to re&s;ult from it. But even if he &s;hould, I &s;hall eat no longer the bit|ter bread of adultery, and con&s;idering that puni&s;hment proportioned to the offence, &s;hall ki&s;s the omnipotent rod without complaining, and &s;upplicate the aids of penitence and patience till my &s;entence is &s;oftened, and the puni&s;hment remitted.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">For the &s;upport of life, I have no doubt but that indu&s;try will enable me to get a &s;ufficiency. You, Charles, have not &s;uffered me to lead a life of idlene&s;s: I am &s;killed in the elegant labours of the needle: I can embroid|er: I have &s;ome little knowledge of tho&s;e employments which may a&s;&s;i&s;t me from applying to the milliners&mdash; nay, and&mdash;&s;uch has been the effect of your in&s;tructions&mdash;I am not in|capable of undertaking the elemen|tary principles of female education. Here, indeed Charles, I feel a &s;evere &s;troke from reflection. Who will put any children under the care of a free woman? what parent will tru&s;t its ri&s;ing hopes to one who has her|&s;elf failed?&mdash;how long, alas! will it
<PB N="46" REF="52">
be before the world can be con|vinced of my penitence, or my pro|priety! let this be as it will, my re|&s;olution remains firm as at the fir&s;t, and Charles mu&s;t be eternally di&s;|united from</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Too amiable CHARLOTTE.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREFORE do you thus officiou&s;ly labour to extort my approbation? and wherefore have you not left it in my power to cen|&s;ure you? were there any hard part in your character&mdash;had you cha|ritably left me but one &s;ingle cruelty, on which I might have founded a rea&s;onable complaint, &s;o that I might have ruminated upon it till I had argued my&s;elf into aver&s;ion, it might
<PB N="48" REF="54">
have been more tolerable: but you are ob&s;tinately bent upon murdering me by your goodne&s;s, and every mo|ment increa&s;e the admiration which I ought to feel daily dimini&s;hing. The laws of the land and the pre|&s;criptions of cu&s;tom have thrown the arguments &s;o abundantly on your &s;ide, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to baffle them without &s;eeming to &s;ophi&s;ticate. Fool and idiot that I was, to run into the &s;hackle that galls for life, and to bind it like a volunteer &s;lave, on my own leg! and yet, Charlotte, you have a&s;&s;i&s;ted Cleora in acting contradic|tions. Does &s;he not by her own confe&s;&s;ion militate again&s;t a re-union? does &s;he not declare the mi&s;ery, of which &s;he fore&s;ees, it would be pro|ductive?
<PB N="49" REF="55">
to what end then&mdash;to what end, but the mo&s;t cruel and unnece&s;|&s;ary one, &s;hould &s;he wi&s;h to effect a &s;eparation between Charles and Char|lotte? Cleora and Charles entertain not for each other either hatred or love; indifference is the point be|tween them. And what virtuous purpo&s;e is likely to ari&s;e from the parting, in which &s;he has been in|&s;trumental.</P>
<P>But you are, I &s;ee, too immer&s;ed in e&s;tabli&s;hed ideas and the cu&s;toms of a country, to admit a &s;ingle ex|ception to a general rule: although a minute's reflection would convince you that <HI>my</HI> ca&s;e and <HI>yours</HI> are &s;uch
<PB N="50" REF="56">
as &s;hould be ab&s;olutely &s;et apart from almo&s;t every other.</P>
<P>Ah, inflexible Charlotte, where|fore have you &s;hielded your heart from the dear arrows of love under the bulwark of &s;uch venerable max|ims&mdash;maxims, which, be their gene|ral tenor ever &s;o admirable, mu&s;t always allow deviation in certain ca&s;es. How ea&s;y were it to prove that, in &s;trict &s;peaking, it would be ab&s;urd and irrational even to unite again with Cleora. Nay, to put our of the que&s;tion every other plea, and rely only on the energy of a &s;ingle argument: the argument of our mutual <HI>indifference,</HI> is it not (demon|&s;trably) ridiculous to live a love|le&s;s
<PB N="51" REF="57">
life with any being? Peculiar circum&s;tances, of temporal di&s;tre&s;s at the fir&s;t occa&s;ioned my leaving Cleora: I left her with a heart ut|terly at liberty, and in &s;ituations in no degree wor&s;e than before I hear|tily invited, and ha&s;tily obtained her hand. Chance, or rather &s;urely the contrivance of &s;ome pitying deity, &s;oon afterwards pre&s;ented before my eye the image of Charlotte. Every thing in human nature that corre|&s;ponds with the pathetic, united to favour our fir&s;t interview. It was in the &s;till hour of midnight: 'twas in the hour of misfortune. We were both &s;ufferers: I mourned the bar|barity of a mother, embarra&s;&s;ed af|fairs, and anxieties at home: you
<PB N="52" REF="58">
were &s;inking under the &s;en&s;e of an equal injury. Social &s;orrows &s;oon &s;uit them&s;elves to the &s;oul, and the impre&s;&s;ion that is made in &s;uch a cri&s;is, is deep and delicate, indeed.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, methinks, the fir&s;t &s;cene; and I feel what language and &s;en|timent denies the power to de&s;cribe. Ah! Charlotte&mdash;Think a little up|on it!&mdash;Prepare for a Picture &s;o particularly intere&s;ting. Invoke the powers of imagination, fidelity, and fondne&s;s to do it ju&s;tice.&mdash;Lay a&s;ide every formal, every unnece&s;&s;ary pun|ctilio, and give, upon &s;o important an occa&s;ion, a full &s;cope to the ten|derne&s;s of nature.&mdash;That tenderne&s;s, my dear, which was be&s;towed by the
<PB N="53" REF="59">
great God of kindne&s;s to
<Q>make the nau&s;eous draught of life go down.</Q></P>
<P>I have, in preparing you for &s;uch a portrait in&s;pired my&s;elf. The &s;ub|ject is not to be with&s;tood.&mdash;I dedi|cate it Charlotte to your &s;en&s;ibility. &mdash;I addre&s;s it to your Heart. Did I, in the fir&s;t Scene, in&s;ult you? Did I in&s;ult you with any offer that could di&s;tre&s;s or confu&s;e you? No, Charlotte &mdash; &s;ome &s;ecret impul&s;e it was that withheld me from the deed: &s;ome god it was, which inclined me to be inqui&s;itively exact in drawing from you the hi&s;tory of your unhappi|ne&s;s. The tale was told with a &s;im|plicity and bewitching artle&s;&s;ne&s;s, that might have gained credit from
<PB N="54" REF="60">
infidelity, and attracted attention from frolic. Let the tears that I then &s;hed, let the kindne&s;s with which I have &s;ince cheri&s;hed you, witne&s;s the truth of my tenderne&s;s and pro|tection. How were we both affec|ted? how did our &s;ympathy incline us to approach till our cheeks were as the repo&s;ing, yet glowing cu&s;hions of each other's. Can you forget the trembling throbs that you felt as I pre&s;&s;ed your making hand upon my bo&s;om.&mdash;I withdrew till you undre&s;t, and I appeal to you, if I did not &s;it like the nur&s;e of your chamber by the &s;ide of your bed till morning. I found it ab&s;olutely impracticable to treat your mi&s;ery in any other man|ner: even your beauty, dazzling as
<PB N="55" REF="61">
it was, and in the mo&s;t trying of all &s;ituations, was not able to betray me: I paid my court to your heart&mdash; to your &s;ituation&mdash;to your pathetic circum&s;tances, and to every thing but your per&s;on: the charms of which, re&s;plendent as I acknowledge they were, I had no lei&s;ure to reflect upon, till I had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;oothed the mighty angui&s;h under which you were &s;truggling.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed a retreat in the re|ce&s;&s;es of the country. Such a retreat, Charlotte, my vigilant affection, (ever wakeful, ever indefatigable) &s;oon pro|vided; and when I had &s;moothed your own &s;ituation, and related to you in the undi&s;gui&s;e of my &s;oul, the
<PB N="56" REF="62">
particulars of mine, I then ventured (and not <HI>till</HI> then) to mention the wi&s;hes, which, after all the little de|laying reluctances that endear ulti|mate con&s;ent, were &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Tell not me, Charlotte, of the prude's unfeeling formality. Do not &s;ugge&s;t to me the &s;neer which out|rageous virtue would ca&s;t upon &s;uch a tran&s;action. Spirits I know there are (terribly holy, and formidably devout&mdash;punctilious as to the minutiae of ceremonials, and negligent of e&s;|&s;entials) which would ridicule the delaying reluctances of Charlotte, as artful pretences &mdash; What&mdash;&s;ay they, piou&s;ly violent&mdash;&s;hall <HI>&s;he</HI> who a&s;cends the <HI>nuptial</HI> couch to &s;upply unlaw|fully,
<PB N="57" REF="63">
the place of the lawful&mdash;to fill the arms that are awefully <HI>pre|occupied</HI>&mdash; who hath, moreover, for|feited her innocence to the &s;educer, and been reduced to irreputable re|fuges &mdash; &s;hall <HI>&s;he</HI> a&s;&s;ume the character of cha&s;tity and all its coyne&s;&s;es, or, indeed, any of tho&s;e marks of amiable|ne&s;s which ought to di&s;tingui&s;h only married mode&s;ty, and maiden deco|rum&mdash;? Fie upon her!</P>
<P>Ah! hard of heart, and &s;hallow of head! illiberal, contracted women! Is it not po&s;&s;ible for virtue to <HI>be</HI> independent of forms? is it not po&s;|&s;ible, in a ca&s;e like Charlotte's, for the mo&s;t un&s;potted purity of mind to &s;urvive an accidental violation of
<PB N="58" REF="64">
per&s;on?&mdash;But then, you reply, &s;he lived, after all, publicly with the hu&s;band of another woman. In any other exigence but her's and mine, it might be impo&s;&s;ible to offer a plea of palliation:
<Q><L>Let wealth and honour wait the wedded dame;</L>
<L>Augu&s;t her deed, and &s;acred be her fame.</L></Q>
Far be it from me, far from the mo&s;t unhappy Charles be it, to bla&s;t the laurels, or wither the ro&s;es of con|jugal life. 'Twere impious, 'twere impracticable. I am not audacious enough to &s;ay with Eloi&s;a,
<Q><PB N="59" REF="65">Cur&s;e on all laws but tho&s;e which love has made.</Q>
Ah gracious, gracious heaven, that it had been permitted to blend in <HI>our</HI> con|nection the laws of love, and of the land, natural, with moral in&s;titutions! &mdash;May never any pair, Charlotte, who love as <HI>we</HI> love, be reduced by the tyranny of their &s;ituation, to equal mea&s;ures: may tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are equally tuned by <HI>nature</HI> into equal &s;ympathy, find a friend in <HI>fortune</HI> to facilitate their union! Happy&mdash;emi|nently happy they, who are thus a&s;|&s;i&s;ted, and who&s;e joys receive, in conformity to the cu&s;tom of nations,
<PB N="60" REF="66">
their imprimatur of tenderne&s;s and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the <HI>altar.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Our fates, Charlotte, were unfor|tunately peculiar, and our re&s;olution to run them together was natural, and, &s;et off as they were by ten thou|&s;and delicacies, irre&s;i&s;table. Let not our conduct be propo&s;ed as an exam|ple to be adopted, where it is even po&s;&s;ible for man and wife to live to|gether: but let not our fidelity, after we <HI>had</HI> united, be cen&s;ured too vigour|ou&s;ly, or too incautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Weigh the&s;e facts well, and they will tempt you to &s;eek again your

&mdash;as a &s;i&s;ter entertained, and as a hu&s;|band cheri&s;hed. Oh Charles, Charles, it is all well, all great, all a noble climax, till we get to the la&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion. It was only <HI>as</HI> a hu&s;band: it was <HI>like</HI> one, that you cheri&s;hed me. 'Twas out of your power&mdash;oh, the malice of fortune&mdash;to <HI>be</HI> one, and as that was the ca&s;e, we &s;hould not have united. I &s;hould have found that genero&s;ity in your <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> which you ought to have denied me in your <HI>tenderne&s;s.</HI> I might have been the object of your <HI>benevolence,</HI> without&mdash; I write the &s;entence with a blu&s;h burning my cheek&mdash;without &s;haring your bed. How would it have re|dounded to the honour of my Charles, how officiou&s;ly would the daughters
<PB N="67" REF="73">
of di&s;tre&s;s have tru&s;ted his fame to the echo of po&s;terity, if his bounty had been totally unaccompanied by guilt: if he had re&s;cued an unhappy girl from mi&s;ery, without bringing her out of one error to lead her into another.</P>
<P>Methinks I now &s;ee how Charles might at once have procured my honour, and my happine&s;s: and I, who know the goodne&s;s of his heart, wonder the &s;cheme, or &s;omething &s;imilar to it, e&s;caped him. Might he not have placed the unhappy fe|male far from the delu&s;ions of the metropolis, in &s;ome &s;heltering part of the country, where the knowledge of her calamity might never arrive?
<PB N="68" REF="74">
There, might &s;he not, under the protection of &s;ome decent matron, have learned all the arts of u&s;eful life, even till the often tran&s;mitted bounty of her ab&s;ent friend Charles, might be no longer nece&s;&s;ary to her &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. What room had here been for probation&mdash;what &s;cope for innocence recovered: and what im|mortality&mdash;what unde&s;cribeable &s;en|&s;ations mu&s;t have attended an action &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted, &s;o unmixt&mdash;&s;o ad|mirable! In&s;tead of which &mdash; but I cannot, I ought not to upbraid you. I acknowledge the delicacy of your deportment when it was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, and when very, very few would have therefore be&s;towed it. But let us drop the &s;ubject: a&s;&s;i&s;t me

not treacherou&s;ly, to the recollection of &s;cenes, which I wi&s;h, and ought to forget. Surely, &s;urely it is not now a time to receive them in the memory.

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<P>INVULNERABLE, and unrelent|ing as you are, I have the right of a painter to fini&s;h my picture. Hard would it indeed be, were I denied &s;o trifling a liberty as that which the pen allows, when I obey your too rigid injunctions in keeping from the apartment which I know to
<PB N="72" REF="78">
contain my trea&s;ure. Think, madam &mdash;oh, that cold word&mdash;think, Char|lotte, of the &s;evere re&s;traint I impo&s;e upon my&s;elf! I know the very hou&s;e in which you &s;leep&mdash;if you indeed <HI>can</HI> &s;leep&mdash;and yet I de&s;i&s;t from going to make enquiries in which I am &s;o much intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>And are you alarmed by the faintly drawn &s;ketch of our fir&s;t week's con|nexion? Alas! how very poor, how very unequal was all which <HI>then</HI> pa&s;t, when compared to the months, and years that &s;ucceeded it! a dew drop to the deep, and main world of wa|ters! Carry your imagination in re|tro&s;pect to the time when we fir&s;t yielded to the exigence, and agreed
<PB N="73" REF="79">
to live in the &s;ame hou&s;e; when, in all tender re&s;pects, we agreed to con&s;i|der our&s;elves as&mdash;united people. Look back to the very night, ever precious to love-&s;ick remembrance, when you fir&s;t indulged the &s;olicited embrace. Till after the attention of many days, I did not dare to intimate the hopes of a conquered heart, nor even at la&s;t, till I had reconciled you to every part of my haple&s;s &s;ituation&mdash;till we had both lamented the bar that pre|vented a public &s;anction. Paint to your fancy the joy that was then realized, when you fir&s;t permitted me, half con&s;enting, half denying, to draw the curtain betwixt us and every interruption &mdash; I can &s;ay no more: I refer you to the powers of
<PB N="74" REF="80">
imagination&mdash;It was not the <HI>un&s;oul'd</HI> debauch of a di&s;&s;ipated pair: it was not the delirium of two young people, &s;edulous to &s;natch the ha&s;ty revels of a night's voluptuou&s;ne&s;s! but it was the unaffected tran&s;port of &s;entiment and ta&s;te, of body and mind, con&s;olidated: not a vein in our hearts that did not thrill to the emo|tions of &s;ympathy: animated by the fire of real love, not a pul&s;e about us that did not leap to &s;alute its hindred pul&s;ation. Remember, above all things, our next morning meeting at breakfa&s;t: the &s;ighs which we then wafted over the tea-cup: the tears which were &s;carce contained within their &s;luices of cry&s;tal: the various flu&s;hings of the countenance,
<PB N="75" REF="81">
and our aukward-enough endeavours to conceal the confu&s;ion which was thus rendered the more apparent, all gave &s;ilent, but delicious te&s;timony, that the mutual approbation was compleat.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will &s;ay, that this might be the energy of juvenile de&s;ire: the mere enthu&s;ia&s;tic riot of the agitated &s;en&s;es&mdash;the tran&s;ient fever of inflamatory &s;pirits. How ea&s;y were it, in oppo&s;ition to this, to prove its origin from a more pure and permanent &s;ource. Reflect, I prithee, fair fugitive, on the &s;cenes which &s;ucceeded. Con&s;ider what diver&s;ity of events happened <HI>after,</HI> to cool the blood, and &s;ettle the &s;en&s;es. Examine the train of misfortunes
<PB N="76" REF="82">
which aro&s;e rapidly one out of ano|ther. Did not my whole patrimony, and all my hopes of elevated circum|&s;tances, &s;ink &s;uddenly before me? did not the hardened creditor then take his advantage of my calamity, and hunt me with a blood-hound indu&s;try, from to place? was not my health invaded in con&s;equence of my anxiety, and were we not both reduced to uncertain re&s;ources? was not this aggregate of affliction enough to quiet the impetuo&s;ity of mere animal inclination? &s;urely it was; but they only rendered <HI>us</HI> &s;till dearer to one another: the burdens were heavy, and each was therefore emu|lous to carry the greate&s;t load of them: we had even a &s;ort of jea|lou&s;y
<PB N="77" REF="83">
le&s;t the one &s;hould encroach upon the &s;hare of the other. Ten|derne&s;s and tran&s;port pre&s;ided over our very difficulties&mdash;Ah! how often in the de&s;olate moment, when the whole hemi&s;phere of hope was cloud|ed, have we watched the fall of the tear upon the cheek, and ki&s;t it away? how frequently have we caught the &s;igh while parting from the lips? great woes we reconciled into &s;entiments of moderation; and eve|ry gale of good fortune, from what|ever corner of her compa&s;s it blew, was &s;welled by love into enchant|ment: the beauty of a flower; the paint of a tulip; the fragrance of a ro&s;e; the &s;udden lu&s;tre of the &s;un; an evening walk; or the morning pro|&s;pect
<PB N="78" REF="84">
over our breakfa&s;t, painted by the gay pencil of imagination, were more than a match for the empty pur&s;e, the ill-natured accident, or mi&s;eries of the greate&s;t magnitude. And, can tho&s;e who have gone for the &s;ervice of each other through the fiery trial, ever forget, ever ulti|mately &s;eparate? Of all paradoxes, it is to me the mo&s;t irreconcilable.</P>
<P>I conjure you then by the memory of our pa&s;t misfortunes, than which even the recollection of extacies is not more endearing&mdash;I conjure you by the memory of our plea&s;ures, of which we have had our proportion&mdash; I conjure you by the wi&s;hes you cheri&s;h for my health; by the many

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>IS this your &s;olemn engagement? pre&s;&s;ing for an interview already. To what end do you think I left you Sir? Was it to give my&s;elf a few days unnece&s;&s;ary agony, to in|volve you in needle&s;s calamity, and then to repent upon my folly, and re|turn again to the errors I have left? I am angry that you think me guilty of &s;o much incon&s;i&s;tency. What a child mu&s;t you believe me? and yet how do you oblige me to be even with you. For &s;hame, Sir, for &s;hame; you want the philo&s;ophy of
<PB N="82" REF="88">
an infant. You have devoted &s;everal of the years of your youth to the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences, you are deeply read in virtuous compo&s;itions, and yet you are more feeble than the babe.</P>
<P>To be outdone in a good action by a woman, by the very wo|man who&s;e undemanding and heart have been, as it were, the work of your own hands: whom you have made what &s;he is &mdash;To let <HI>her</HI> &s;ur|pa&s;s you in fortitude! Blu&s;h, blu&s;h, and ri&s;e into the ambition of excel|ling her.</P>
<P>From the very arguments that you draw as motives of my return,
<PB N="83" REF="89">
I can extract the mo&s;t forcible rea|&s;ons for my de&s;i&s;ting from a re|union, even &s;uppo&s;ing that there was no per&s;onal criminality attending it.</P>
<P>Wherefore &s;hould I hang as a clog at the foot of a man already op|pre&s;&s;ed by the heavy hand of cala|mity? whatever you may think, it is no real te&s;timony of regard to &s;hare your mi&s;eries without being able to relieve them. To behold you &s;truggling with your fate, with|out the power to better it, and ra|ther adding <HI>to,</HI> than taking <HI>from,</HI> your embarra&s;&s;ments. No, Charles; tru&s;t me, we can both do more to|lerably alone, at lea&s;t for the pre|&s;ent: in the cour&s;e of a little time, for|tune
<PB N="84" REF="90">
may be generous to one of us, <HI>which,</HI> is a point of no moment: our per&s;ons only, and not our pur&s;es, are divided: it will be the &s;ame thing whether the &s;hower of pro&s;perity falls upon Charles, or Charlotte: I hope neither of us &s;hall at any time be capable of &s;eparate intere&s;ts, and that neither of us &s;hall be too proud to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the hand of the other. As to your part, your talents will recommend you, <HI>where&s;oever</HI> or <HI>how&s;oever</HI> you exert them; and you cannot long fail of conquering the inconveniences which at pre&s;ent &s;ur|round you. Charlotte's &s;ociety, how|ever dear, was rather an impedi|ment than any thing el&s;e, to Charles's advancement, and he will now be
<PB N="85" REF="91">
admitted into connections which were before impenetrable. We may a|mu&s;e our&s;elves, my dear friend, with the idea of de&s;pi&s;ing the cu&s;toms of our country, and the forms of our church: nay, we may attempt to &s;oothe our&s;elves with the opinions of our&s;elves, and a narrow circle of our private friends, but if the voice of the public, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of religion are again&s;t us, it will be in vain that we receive a <HI>partial</HI> approbation. It is not only politic, but morally ju&s;t, that the general clamour &s;hould be rai&s;ed again&s;t a couple in our &s;ituation. The di&s;agreements that pa&s;s under a man's own roof, and the quarrels or feuds which divide the hu&s;band from
<PB N="86" REF="92">
the wife, do not authorize an open defiance of either the laws of man, or the commands of God: nor will the world, however proper the &s;e|paration, ever enter into the intri|cacies of circum&s;tance, or pathetic of pa&s;&s;ion that throws the divided hu&s;band into the arms of another woman. I am &s;till willing to hope, Charles, that our offence will be mi|tigated by the God of mercy, upon account of the many peculiar temp|tations and exigences that belonged to it: in &s;trict &s;peaking, perhaps, there may not be any greater degree of guilt in our late connection, than if it had immediately &s;ucceeded a divorce from your Cleora: but when I am appealed to by a pleading wife,
<PB N="87" REF="93">
who charges me with &s;educing the the affections of a hu&s;band; when I am branded by that wife, as the art|ful and infamous cau&s;e of her child's mi&s;ery, and her own, among&s;t all her friends and acquaintances; when I am held up as the terror of mar|ried women, at the very time that I know I would have at any time yielded the &s;ociety of Charles to to more lawful claims; how do you think I can bear to live under this load of half-merited ignominy, and half-unde&s;erved reproach? the truth will break, like the &s;un, through all di&s;gui&s;ing interceptions: the delicacy of your pa&s;&s;ion for me, Charles, led you to conceal the fact in regard to my real &s;ituation. Wherever you
<PB N="88" REF="94">
went, the brilliance of your wit and the poli&s;h of your genius, together with the public evidences you have given of it, attracted notice, en|&s;ured popularity, and commanded curio&s;ity&mdash;You took me by the hand, and pre&s;ented me in all our excur&s;ions as your <HI>wedded wife:</HI> I did my be&s;t to &s;upport the character, I would have given worlds to have realized it: but even in my happie&s;t moment, Charles, I felt a pang at my heart, and apprehended a di&s;covery that would have overwhelmed me with the blu&s;hes of confu&s;ion. In the cour&s;e of our rambles, your &s;anction pro|vided for me &s;everal amiable friends. I had too much veneration for the <HI>name</HI> of wife to injure it by any
<PB N="89" REF="95">
light, or unbecoming behaviour; and I have the felicity to reflect, that my deportment under this a&s;&s;umed character, was in all re&s;pects, con|jugal and exact: well was it for me, neverthele&s;s, dear Charles, that our pa&s;&s;ion for travel, did not allow us to &s;tay long in a place. Your &s;i|tuation mu&s;t &s;oon have been pub|licly known; even the political <HI>di&s;|gui&s;e</HI>
of your <HI>real</HI> name mu&s;t have been &s;een through; your fatal pre-engagement with Cleora would have been detected, and the endearing coun|tenance that was before &s;hewn me, while I lay under the &s;helter of a charming impo&s;ition, would be ig|nominiou&s;ly withdrawn. That this, in part <HI>has</HI> been the ca&s;e, you can|not
<PB N="90" REF="96">
but remember: I have occa&s;ion|ally been met by an old acquaintance of yours, who hath officiou&s;ly cir|culated the &s;ecret of our connexion, and my character became in an in|&s;tant &s;u&s;pected, or at lea&s;t ambi|guous.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try with which I applied to tho&s;e accompli&s;hments in which it is the chief glory of women to excel, and the books and ma&s;ters which you recommended to me for that purpo&s;e, &s;oon poli&s;hed &s;implicity into a degree of refined knowledge, and made me more de&s;erving my Charles's &s;ociety. And yet, my friend, the agonies of my heart increa&s;ed with the in&s;truc|tions of my head. Objects and ac|tions
<PB N="91" REF="97">
&s;oon pre&s;ented them&s;elves to me in a different light from that in which I had been accu&s;tomed to behold them: the days of girli&s;h giddine&s;s were pa&s;t, and the &s;edater reflections of the woman &s;ucceeded. From a &s;tate of ru&s;ticity and village igno|rance, I was able to think profoundly and compare accurately; a nicer &s;en&s;e of right and wrong began to take place; an aweful admiration for il|lu&s;trious characters, and a more than enthu&s;ia&s;tic ambition to reach them, &s;eized upon my &s;en&s;es: proportioned to the augmentation of my intellec|tual powers, ro&s;e into greater lu&s;tre the &s;en&s;ibilities of my &s;oul; and, un|der the influence of the&s;e cultivations, all flowing from the generous &s;tream
<PB N="92" REF="98">
of Charles's fondne&s;s, think what I mu&s;t in the cool hour undergo, at the thought of living in a &s;tate &s;o palpably condemned by mandates above and below; and &s;o forcibly reprobated by every law, divine and human.</P>
<P>It was not, Charles, over the exi|gences of a precarious fortune, it was not for the lo&s;s of your e&s;tate, nor was it even for the gradual de|clinings of your health, that half tho&s;e tears were &s;hed, which in different places, and at different periods, flowed from me. Studious of your &s;erenity, how often have I repre&s;s'd the &s;igh that was half ready to break its way through my bo&s;om: arm in arm as
<PB N="93" REF="99">
we walked affectionately together, amid&s;t the perfumes of the &s;pring, or the fragrant profu&s;ions of the &s;ummer; delighted too as I was with the faith|ful te&s;timonies of the warme&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that ever nature rendered mutual, even then, in &s;ea&s;ons &s;o &s;acred to compo&s;ure, the bitter idea would overtake me, and I have been com|pelled to complain of &s;ome tran&s;ient pain of the per&s;on, to hide from my companion the angui&s;h of the heart. Nay, Charles, I have often &s;ought out a hiding-place when my heart was overcharged, to relieve it by tears. That Cleora and you could not live amicably together, that I was the woman of your choice, that incidents perfectly uncommon united us, that
<PB N="94" REF="100">
we both lived in the &s;tricte&s;t fidelity, that our pa&s;&s;ion was as elevated as ever inhabited the human bo&s;om, and that we were every thing that is pre|cious to each other, were by no means counterballances to the cen&s;ure of the world, the violation of moral obligations, the &s;trokes of my own con&s;cience, and the claims of Cleora, which my avow'd re&s;idence with you, <HI>&s;eemed</HI> at lea&s;t to intercept.</P>
<P>Collect your&s;elf &s;ufficiently Charles, to put the&s;e &s;everal &s;entiments toge|ther: con&s;ider them one by one, as you arrange them in due order, and form them into a whole. When you have done this, quiet I be&s;eech you the di&s;orders of every rebellious pa&s;|&s;ion,

<P>Your wife is now in London, Charles, and the child, which you have &s;o long and anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed to fondle in your arms, is now blooming in beauty, by the &s;ide of her.

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE. (After receiving the above.)</HEAD>
<P>DEAR, and ju&s;tly offended Charlotte, forgive me! The agonies I have felt, and &s;till feel from your reproaches, are even more in&s;upportable than the ab&s;ence which made me ru&s;h into the behaviour that de&s;erved them. And yet, (&s;o thrive my hopes for your felicity) I am le&s;s guilty than you may be led to gue&s;s, from the declarations of a drunken man!</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141">Since the letter has fallen into your hands, I will religiou&s;ly relate the unextenuated facts.</P>
<P>The lunacy of di&s;appointed love, and the madne&s;s of wine, to which you know I am &s;o little accu&s;tomed, hurried me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, into all the di&s;tractions of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>When the partner of my intoxi|cation left me, I was in the &s;treet; &s;carce &s;en&s;ible in my head, and unable to keep my heels. I &s;tood &s;up|porting my&s;elf for &s;ome time again&s;t the pillars of a door in a &s;tate of irre&s;olution: even then, the image of the relentle&s;s Charlotte pre&s;ented it&s;elf; I would have died with plea|&s;ure
<PB N="136" REF="142">
the next morning, to have part that night in your company. The little likelihood of this drove me to de&s;pair, and calling a coach, I or|dered the driver to carry me to your lodgings. About twenty yards from the hou&s;e I pulled the check-&s;tring, and alighted: the moon was in her meridian, and I walked on till I came oppo&s;ite your window. The &s;hutters were clo&s;ed; the &s;treets were quiet, and not an object near, except the watchman, who&s;e night-box was &s;ta|tioned within five paces of your apartment. I twined my arms in a melancholy folding, and directed my eye, as I &s;tood fixed, to that part of the man&s;ion which I knew you occupied. There is a lane which
<PB N="137" REF="143">
leads to the back of the hou&s;e, and I got &s;taggeringly upon the wall that &s;eparated the property. Here, Char|lotte, as I &s;tood upright on the ridge, I commanded the adjacent apart|ments.&mdash;The extreme warmth of the night had induced the inhabitant to &s;uffer the &s;a&s;h about a third part open, and the cooling breezes of midnight rewarded the de&s;ign. Ah! God! what were my &s;en&s;ations, when, levelling my eye to the ca&s;ement, I &s;aw, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the moon-beams, (at this time uncommonly bright) a dre&s;s that I knew! At the edge of the toilet lay that very hu&s;|&s;ive which I pre&s;ented to you &s;o very lately, and who&s;e fir&s;t employment was to contain the needles which a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="138" REF="144">
in making the ruffles you left unfini&s;hed. The &s;potted handker|chief, the cap, the hat, and even the garters you your&s;elf knitted, were there. Spread upon a chair, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, was a packet of pa|pers, partly unfolded, perhaps the corre&s;pondence of Charles&mdash;and the curtain on the female &s;ide of the bed was undrawn: at the foot it was impenetrably and enviou&s;ly pinned clo&s;e together. Imagine, oh! ima|gine, my &s;ituation! for I cannot de|&s;cribe it. The watchman neglected to in&s;pect the lane, though he &s;at almo&s;t at the beginning of it. Love's au&s;pi|cious god had &s;urely charmed him to re&s;t, for he did not even call his hour after the clock had &s;truck. I re|mained
<PB N="139" REF="145">
&s;till undi&s;covered, and could not per&s;uade mv&s;elf to remove. How &s;hall I paint what followed? ah! beloved woman, pardon and pity me! I brought my ear even with the edge of the window-frame, and li&s;tened: what did I hear? even the balmy breath of my Charlotte, heaving &s;omewhat interruptedly in &s;lumber. I opened my lips, if aught of the perfume would reach me, that I might inhale it. Five minutes, or more than five, did I continue in this attitude; and then &mdash; mighty love a&s;&s;i&s;t me &mdash; then did I hear the deare&s;t of women, &s;tart|ing from her &s;leep, exclaim&mdash; "This &s;hould be <HI>his</HI> pillow&mdash;here &s;hould his cheek repo&s;e&mdash;ah!
<PB N="140" REF="146">
Charles, Charles, why did we ever meet? this parting will di&s;tract me" &mdash;My heart at this time prompted me to di&s;cover my&s;elf, and I trembling|ly put my hand to the &s;a&s;h, and heaved it higher&mdash;I could have &s;tep|ped into Charlotte's bedchamber with ea&s;e: another lift would have carried me into her arms; but the pullies rattled, you called loudly to know "who was there," and I was compelled to de&s;cend from the walls of paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>The abruptne&s;s with which I de|&s;cended, brought me headlong to the ground, I cut my&s;elf with pieces of broken gla&s;s, and other rubbi&s;h that had been thrown into the lane.
<PB N="141" REF="147">
I had ju&s;t ri&s;en, when I once more looked at the window, where, to compleat my mi&s;ery, I &s;aw the di&s;|robed, lovely, and beautiful Char|lotte, pulling down the &s;a&s;h.</P>
<P>Agitated as I was, I dared not &s;peak. I kept my promi&s;e with you, even in drunkenne&s;s, and was &s;ilent under all the&s;e touching circum&s;tan|ces. But what did all the&s;e efforts of honour co&s;t me? I thought my &s;en&s;es would utterly have left me!</P>
<P>That nothing may remain con|cealed, I will di&s;clo&s;e even the &s;cenes which &s;ucceeded &mdash; And yet, why <HI>&s;hould</HI> I? to what end do I make you acquainted with more in|&s;tances

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. HAMLET TEMPLETON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>FOR heaven's &s;ake, my dear Charles, be more guarded: you will de&s;troy the happine&s;s both of Charlotte and your&s;elf. She is
<PB N="143" REF="149">
palpably jealous of you: every &s;yl|lable in her letter declares it. Her tenderne&s;s for you is even greater than ever. I conjure you, therefore, not to injure her: continue &s;till to con&s;ider her &s;ilently as your &s;i&s;ter, and I prophecy that &s;omething will happen in the cour&s;e of a little time, to make her as e&s;&s;entially your wife, by the laws of the land, as &s;he is evidently already by the laws of the tendere&s;t love that can po&s;&s;ibly be reciprocated. At lea&s;t give her the indulgence of a &s;hort period. I &s;till expect to &s;ee you happy together, and I am per&s;uaded, if you let for|tune take her own play, without un|&s;ea&s;onably interrupting her, &s;he will contrive matters in your favour, till
<PB N="144" REF="150">
all &s;hall work together for your good. Per&s;ecutions and &s;earchings after her at pre&s;ent, will only defeat your purpo&s;es. View her, therefore, I again conjure you, as the deare&s;t relation in the world, who cannot po&s;&s;ibly live in the &s;ame hou&s;e with you. Surely there is a mo&s;t delicate con&s;olation in believing your&s;elf mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately beloved by an <HI>ab&s;ent</HI> friend. That you <HI>are</HI> pa&s;&s;ionately beloved, and that you will continue to be &s;o, there is not the &s;malle&s;t doubt: and, give me as a friend, leave to tell you, that, to &s;uppo&s;e you are <HI>not,</HI> is a poor compliment to Charlotte: your incredulity, in this ca&s;e, argues your want of con|fidence. Depend upon it, if &s;he
<PB N="145" REF="151">
who has torn her&s;elf from you, ever finds it again in her power (I mean in the power of her feelings) to re|turn, &s;he will not he&s;itate to crown the warme&s;t wi&s;hes of her amiable companion, who, both by habit and inclination, mu&s;t be too dear to be &s;oon forgotten. Do you think &s;he <HI>has</HI> forgotten you? oh, Charles, you cannot be &s;o ignorant of the work|ings of nature, nor can you be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to the peculiarly &s;oft heart of her, who&s;e ab&s;ence you are de|ploring. Take my word for it, that were you to meet twelve-months hence, your fir&s;t interview would not be &s;u&s;tained like per&s;ons who had buried the remembrance of each other. I judge not romantically,
<PB N="146" REF="152">
but from a knowledge of you both: I judge from the &s;cenes of lively, and la&s;ting endearment you have both experienced: you can no more for|get one another, than you can forget your&s;elves. Many a &s;ad hour does &s;he feel, as well as Charles, and much angui&s;h mu&s;t &s;he undergo to &s;upport and continue the&s;e triumphs of her delicacy. Once more, there|fore, I de&s;ire you to let things take their cour&s;e, and, by &s;ome &s;troke of providence, Charlotte will a&s;&s;ur|edly be re&s;tored to you. I am not able to &s;ettle my bu&s;ine&s;s here &s;o expeditiou&s;ly as I could, for your &s;ake, wi&s;h.

<P>GOOD God, Charles, what a life do you make me lead! and what real mi&s;ery hath di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the night and the day &s;ince the arrival of your la&s;t! how can you be &s;o ingenious to torture your own heart and mine?

<P>I HAVE met an adventure that I think may draw off your mind, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from its pre&s;ent fatal object of contempla|tion; and therefore I will de&s;cribe it as accurately as my memory permits. You cannot too atten|tively apply your&s;elf to tho&s;e &s;cenes which amu&s;e the imagination and &s;oothe the fancy.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="160">At the hou&s;e of Mr. &mdash; where I now am on a vi&s;it (from which I cannot yet politely di&s;engage &s;elf) dined the other day, &s;ix people of both &s;exes; among&s;t them a &s;tripling, who complained bit|terly that he had been abu&s;ed by the lady of his heart, who, after a court|&s;hip (and all its co&s;tly con&s;equences) of five years, had left him in the lurch; kept his pre&s;ents, &s;tolen his affections, and turned him adrift, in favour of a &s;tupid fellow with a &s;mooth face, a laced coat, and a well-turned pair of legs. This poor &s;wain made a fool of him&s;elf all din|ner time, could drink little, eat le&s;s, &s;ighed every &s;econd, and at la&s;t &s;o|lemnly declared he would renounce
<PB N="155" REF="161">
the &s;ex, and &s;et out the next week to &s;eek for indifference, in rambling round the habitable globe.</P>
<P>After this declaration, he &s;at &s;ilent and melancholy for a long time, and really infected the whole company: at length an old gentleman that &s;at next him, tapp'd him &s;oftly on the &s;houlder, and &s;aid, "he was in hopes he did not know in what <HI>real</HI> mi&s;ery con&s;i&s;ted; and &s;o, continued he, as we are all mighty <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and in|clined to be pen&s;ive, I will tell you the heads of <HI>my</HI> hi&s;tory, from which you will be able, perhaps, to deduce a very u&s;eful le&s;&s;on: namely, that happine&s;s hates to be <HI>hunted,</HI> and is very &s;eldom caught by tho&s;e, who

<HI>violently</HI> pur&s;ue her. She dete&s;ts pre&s;&s;ing, and mu&s;t come a volun|teer into the &s;ervice of mortals."</P>
<P>"All our mi&s;ery, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t portions of it, ari&s;e from the want of &s;ettled and con&s;olidated &s;entiments&mdash;in other words, from &s;ubmitting to the violence of various pa&s;&s;ions, without &s;ticking to any one of them upon principle. This has been my misfortune; take care that it is not yours. I am now, you &s;ee, in the decline of life, and yet, from the time that I came to years of di&s;cretion, as <HI>indi&s;creet</HI> people too often call them, I have been cha|cing different &s;hadows; and fluctuat|ing, tempe&s;t-to&s;t, betwixt oppo&s;ite
<PB N="157" REF="163">
opinions. At my fir&s;t coming into the world, a mere noviciate in all re&s;pects, (as it were, in the very morning of exigence) fancy, and curio&s;ity threw before my eye a thou|&s;and gay and glittering appearances. I could neither engage in a dance, or make one at a dinner, or attend a concert, or vi&s;it any place of public diver&s;ion, without receiving &s;ome un|lucky impre&s;&s;ion in favour of objects either recommended by their novel|ty, or to which I was invited by the ardour of my temper. I, like you, had a free hand, a liberal &s;oul, and a &s;u&s;ceptible heart: my &s;pirits were lively, my ideas excur&s;ive, and fancy for ever on the wing. The ruling propen&s;ities of my nature
<PB N="158" REF="164">
were &s;ocial, and, I cultivated with a vigour peculiar to young people, all the friendly and intere&s;ting con|nections."</P>
<P>"To re&s;cue my friend, or to prove my fidelity, to him, I &s;et at nought hazard, embarra&s;&s;ment, and enter|prize, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;tical ve|hemence of a knight-errant. My ef|forts were without the lea&s;t merce|nary mixture, and my opinions con|ceived and admitted without any &s;u&s;picion. Having indulged this luxury of the young man for &s;ome time, till certain tokens of in&s;ince|rity &s;omewhat cooled my ardour, I was taught by experience, the nece&s;|&s;ity of caution, and found it whole|&s;ome
<PB N="159" REF="165">
to alter a little the &s;y&s;tem I had adopted: in&s;tead, therefore, of falling in love at fir&s;t &s;ight, of conferring in|di&s;criminate favours, of fixing pro|mi&s;cuous friend&s;hips, or of lavi&s;hing offers of &s;ervice to all men, without caution or di&s;tinction, I was tempted to enter into intercour&s;es of a more &s;tationary kind: my appetites were now le&s;s refractory: imagination had enjoyed her frolic, and the curio&s;ity of a rambling, romantic heart was &s;atisfied. I now re&s;olved to begin the world on a new principle: I courted a young woman eminently beautiful, and obtained her hand: from this moment I entertained no|tions, views and wi&s;hes, utterly the rever&s;e of my former ones: fortune&mdash;
<PB N="160" REF="166">
intere&s;t&mdash;children&mdash;family and po&s;te|rity, all crouded upon me: the &s;hil|ling, which in my late bachelor-&s;tate I &s;hould have to&s;s'd carele&s;ly away, I turned very deliberately, and placed it as an accumulated twelve-pence in my drawer."</P>
<P>"At the end of a year my wife pre&s;ented me with a &s;imilitude of her&s;elf; and the moment it came into the world, I imagined it gave &s;o &s;acred an addition to my character, that, I remember well, on that very day I bu&s;tled into my barber's &s;hop with an unu&s;ual &s;trut, and ordered a &s;upernumerary row of curls to my peruke, the better to figure as the father of a family. The &s;ucceeding
<PB N="161" REF="167">
year gave me a &s;on, with whom I was no &s;ooner provided, than I be|came anxious to provide a fortune to &s;upport him. To accompli&s;h this, need I &s;ay, that I adopted the mo&s;t circum&s;pect maxims. I gave no|thing without knowing to what end. I engaged in a good bu&s;ine&s;s, enter|tained but &s;eldom, threw my&s;elf as little as po&s;&s;ible in the way of plea|&s;urable temptation, ro&s;e up early in the morning to the account book, and knowing my infirmity (for you mu&s;t know I always loved <HI>wine</HI>) I kept the bottle out of &s;ight. Yet, in reward of this &s;elf-denial, I eat hearty, &s;lept &s;ound, and repaired the con&s;titution, which the career of the former part of my life had deplora|bly
<PB N="162" REF="168">
&s;haken. For &s;everal years I ap|plied my&s;elf to the maxims of gain, and, in the end, obtained by &s;uch indu&s;try a con&s;iderable fortune."</P>
<P>"About this period my &s;entiments underwent <HI>another</HI> total alteration: from the dome&s;tic friend and man of bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hifted to the man of magnificence and parade; and ju&s;t as I had, by dint of infinite drudgery, obtained a good fortune, I took it into my head to &s;pend it like a fool. As you are in <HI>love,</HI> young Sir, you know &s;omething about human in|con&s;i&s;tency, and therefore will not wonder at this apparent lunacy. Well, Sir, I took it into my ridi|culous head, as I was &s;aying, to pur|cha&s;e
<PB N="163" REF="169">
a piece of ground on the &s;ide of a hill, in the county of Somer&s;et: upon this hill, I had the non&s;en&s;ical ambition to build a &s;pacious hou&s;e, and in this hou&s;e, to my &s;hame be it &s;poken, I placed pictures and paint|ings, which, as the learned in tho&s;e matters <HI>told me,</HI> were extremely fine and valuable. I now no longer li&s;ten'd to the chatter upon change, the jargon of Garraway's, nor the &s;tupidity of the &s;tocks. I bu&s;tled no more in bu&s;ine&s;s, took my ca&s;h out of trade, &s;et up a chai&s;e, and commenced the <HI>eminent merchant retired from</HI> ways, <HI>to live upon his</HI> means. I turned a bleak, bare hill behind my villa, into a &s;hrubbery of &s;irs, and the &s;teep de&s;cent from be|fore my front door, I converted into
<PB N="164" REF="170">
a garden, in which I placed &s;tatues of all the great folks; and, that the matter might be compleat, I ordered a pond to be cut in the centre, that I might have at once wood, water, and fi&s;h into the bargain. My wife, however, &s;oon complained that the walls were damp, my children were con&s;tantly afflicted with colds: my gardener di&s;covered, that nothing either u&s;eful or beautiful would grow, upon account of barren ground; and the neighbouring gentry, after paying a compliment to my ta&s;te in building, pitied me on being unfortunate in the <HI>&s;ituation.</HI> I made no more ado, Sir, but upon this, I pull'd (like a true baby tired of my plaything) the whole edifice down, even to the corner|&s;tone;
<PB N="165" REF="171">
and, in the rage of my heart, hurried with my family again to Lon|don, where I took lodgings, and, in mere de&s;pair and &s;hame, &s;hut my&s;elf up for &s;everal days."</P>
<P>"My fortune, acquired by the di|ligence of many years, was too &s;ub|&s;tantial to be much hurt by a &s;ingle folly. I had indeed thrown away up|wards of two thou&s;and pounds, and I had got a pretty deal of experience. Now mark the rever&s;e: from that day to this, I do not believe I have mi&s;employed or mi&s;placed a &s;ingle penny. You &s;ee me now in the la&s;t &s;tage of my journey. My wife is in heaven, and my children are in good circum&s;tances: one of my boys has

As to my&s;elf, after all the fro|lics and vagaries of youth, I have &s;omething to line the ea&s;y chair of old age: I have an old woman to rub my ancles when the gout hath wrapt them up in flannels; my bed is the &s;ofter for being my own buying, and though I do not bid every puppy put his hand into my pur&s;e, yet, if he can prove to me that he is not a rogue, and is guilty only of raggedne&s;s, I &s;hall never be churl enough to refu&s;e

him a ca&s;t coat that hangs idly col|lecting du&s;t upon a peg, nor will I &s;end him away in the winter, without warming him&s;elf again&s;t the weather, by a warm &s;eat in the chimney-corner.

<P>I HAVE health, or at lea&s;t &s;trength enough returned to vindicate my|&s;elf to you; for I feel, that I mu&s;t ever remain additionally unea&s;y till I &s;tand fair and un&s;u&s;pected in your thoughts and opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="175">True it is, that I wandered into a hou&s;e of ill reputation, and did it with a view of burying the image which haunted my repo&s;e. The utmo&s;t, indeed, that could po&s;&s;ibly be expec|ted from &s;uch an effort, was not plea|&s;ure, but alleviation of pain. Heaven knows I did not hope for happine&s;s from the embraces of venal beauty, but merely to deaden for a moment, the &s;en&s;e of intolerable angui&s;h; and even this was attempted in the ab&s;ence or lethargy of every cool and rational faculty. Shall I confe&s;s to you, that I &s;ent a creature of convenience for a wretched female, who depended on her daily violations for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? the me&s;&s;enger delayed, and my &s;pirits &s;inking in the <HI>interim,</HI> I &s;wallowed a
<PB N="170" REF="176">
bumper of champaign, and drank to the health of Charlotte, even in my debauch. As I was pouring down the third gla&s;s, now almo&s;t daylight, I heard the ru&s;tle of &s;ilks upon the &s;tairs. What a &s;en&s;ation did this trifle produce! but, ah! how unlike <HI>that I</HI> had been us'd to feel, when the &s;tep of Charlotte animated my expecta|tion. A female came; &s;hewy, labo|riou&s;ly adorned, and, as &s;he &s;oon told me, ju&s;t out of bed. I began immediately to make compari&s;ons: they were indeed <HI>odious.</HI> I look'd in the eyes, for Charlotte's love-born langui&s;hment, and I found in their &s;tead artful ogles, mi&s;u&s;ing the lu&s;tre of what might once have been innocently bright. I &s;urveyed
<PB N="171" REF="177">
the face for tender &s;en&s;ibility; the form for engaging deportment, and the dre&s;s, for the union of elegance and judgment; in&s;tead of which, I beheld confident aukwardne&s;s, and a flaunting variety, betraying at once the ta&s;te and the trade. The lady, however, to whom long habit had rendered every thing indifferent but finery, called up a look which &s;igni|fied an entire compliance. I mu&s;t own to my dear friend, that time, place, and opportunity, all favoured. Ah! madam, there was but one thing wanting to compleat the &s;cene. There was only wanting&mdash; <HI>inclina|tion.</HI> In a word Charlotte, confe&s;s your&s;elf deceived in me; confe&s;s that I am le&s;s infamou&s;ly unfaithful
<PB N="172" REF="178">
than you &s;uppo&s;ed. I was &s;hocked, di&s;gu&s;ted, and bur&s;t into tears both of remor&s;e and di&s;appointment. As &s;oon as I recovered, I threw five pieces on the table, hung on my &s;word with a trembling hand, and bade the unfortunate, farewell. Upon this tran&s;action I dare not make a comment, nor have I the courage to expect more than your pity for the yet ardent pa&s;&s;ion of</P>

<P>YOU are not to be acquainted that I have lo&s;t my happine&s;s. But that is not to be the &s;ubject of this addre&s;s: you complain of your circum&s;tances, and I &s;hall, to the ut|mo&s;t of my very &s;lender abilities, be ever ready to alleviate them.

<P>I find that <HI>our child</HI> is at boarding-&s;chool at a great di&s;tance from you: as your money is locked up at pre|&s;ent, the &s;upport of this mu&s;t be in|convenient. I have been long anxious to &s;ee, and have my &s;hare of the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the &s;ociety of the child; and I will now venture to reque&s;t that I may be allowed to take

I will lead it up in the paths of honour; not a &s;entiment &s;hall be inculcated but tho&s;e that will in&s;pire her heart with virtue, or accompli&s;h her head with under&s;tanding.

I have thoughts of placing it near me at an excellent &s;eminary, of which I will, at the proper time, give you the direction, that you may favour the object of our mutual de|light with your vi&s;its, and maternal attention: only tru&s;t it to my care, and I &s;hall be &s;atisfied.</P>

<P>I WRITE to you with my left arm in a &s;ling, and a ball in the bottom of my brea&s;t, as yet vainly endeavoured to be extracted: the an|gui&s;h of my mind exceeds that of my body, and I have no relief but from writing to you; and that <HI>is</HI> a relief although it is not without a great deal of pain I hold the pen: my &s;ur|geon, however, has left me for an

hour, and I am re&s;olved to employ the interval of his perfections, in re|lating to you the principal circum|&s;tances of a quarrel that ended in blood on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>I was on Tue&s;day la&s;t at a public dinner in the city, whither I went (in the hand of an acquaintance) on purpo&s;e to di&s;&s;ipate a little, and to expel thought, by looking about me. The gla&s;s was bri&s;kly circulated, and after we had run rapidly the round of general healths, &s;uch as the king, church, royal family, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> we came home to the private toa&s;ts of the heart, and drank each to the pro|&s;perity of his pa&s;&s;ion, and the happi|ne&s;s of his mi&s;tre&s;s. In the &s;incerity
<PB N="186" REF="192">
of my heart, I verged a little upon common ceremonies, and gave the divine Charlotte. I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee many politely ready to fill his gla&s;s of good wi&s;hes; but a per|&s;on at the other end of the table re|peated her name two or three times &s;arca&s;tically, and at la&s;t, in a kind of half whi&s;per, told his companion that &s;he was to be <HI>had</HI> at&mdash;, but that her price was confoundedly high. I de&s;ired an explanation of this&mdash; &s;moke the <HI>favourite,</HI> &s;aid the gen|tleman, &s;impering to his compa|nion.&mdash;The companion called to order, and I &s;at down: we drank freely, and though my heart lay burning within my bo&s;om, I did not revive the &s;ubject, 'till the toa&s;t came
<PB N="187" REF="193">
round to the per&s;on who had in&s;ulted me. He propo&s;ed a lady: I drank her health, and then apologizing to the ma&s;ter of the treat for being un|able to &s;tay longer, withdrew.</P>
<P>I retired ha&s;tily into a room be|longing to the &s;ame tavern, and &s;oon found from my landlord, the name and quality of the per&s;on which at pre&s;ent employed my thoughts: he was an half pay officer of &mdash;'s re|giment. Pen and ink being brought, I wrote as follows:

<P>YOUR profe&s;&s;ion leaves your courage un&s;u&s;pected.

I am &s;tepping out to prepare <HI>properly</HI> for your reception, as I pre&s;ume neither of us are prepared in that way; but I &s;hall return im|mediately.</P>
<P>After I had folded up, and &s;ent the waiter with this billet, I went to a

Stung beyond mea&s;ure at this, I ran abruptly into the dining-room, and placed my&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the in&s;ulter. He was that minute entering into what he was plea&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e the hi&s;tory of our former &s;eparation, having heard, as it appeared, &s;ome ab&s;urd &s;tory on that &s;ubject. He broke off upon my en|trance, and filled his gla&s;s: ju&s;t as he

was lifting it to his lip, I ro&s;e, and in a whi&s;per told him my contemptible opinion of a <HI>&s;coundrel,</HI> e&s;pecially when he happened to di&s;grace a cockade. The colour of rage immediately ro&s;e over our hero's countenance, and he threw the contents of his gla&s;s into my face. All mea&s;ures being now taken between us, I withdrew a &s;econd time, and the lieutenant was held by his companions.</P>

<P>NOW the murder's out I find. I &s;hall forbear henceforward to wonder at your extravagance, or at the various &s;hifts you are driven to, to &s;upport it. Upon my word, young gentleman, you are a mighty pretty fellow; a very prince of ge|nero&s;ity; a perfect Pilades! and pray who <HI>is</HI> this heroic Ore&s;tes? but no matter! and &s;o you want to fleece the old fellow out of fifty pieces, do

<P>To be plain, young man, I do not expect any good from you while you are &s;o con&s;umedly liberal, and ready to give away your money to every coxcomb or impo&s;tor that a&s;ks for it.

writing pathetic letters before the nervous &s;y&s;tem could bear &s;uch alar|ming concu&s;&s;ions, I would not, on any account, have you take any no|tice of this friendly hint to my pa|tient.

I cannot but u&s;e this opportunity to applaud the dignity of your re&s;o|lutions in regard to the &s;eparation. 'Tis an effort even &s;uperior to the virtue of the Spartan Ladies: 'tis Roman&mdash;'tis Chri&s;tian! How much ought you to be celebrated for &s;o il|lu&s;trious an action! and how infinite|ly ought Cleora to &s;ound your prai&s;es!
<PB N="228" REF="234">
at the &s;ame time, my good lady, are you not a little too enterprizing to continue the corre&s;pondence? was it not a little too much in the novel &s;train to come in a boy's habit, and di&s;play &s;uch various beauties to the eye of Charles, in &s;uch a &s;ituation&mdash; &s;oftened as he was by &s;ickne&s;s, touched as he mu&s;t be at the di&s;covery? you recollect to what an embarra&s;&s;ment he was reduced: did not he faint? did not he fall lifele&s;s on the pillow? and was it not with great difficulty you your&s;elf could &s;upport the con|flict? &s;uffer me to &s;ay, &s;uch trials, if frequent, would &s;tagger the firme&s;t philo&s;ophy, and I doubt, it is at be&s;t ra&s;hne&s;s to put too much con|fidence in our own &s;trength when we

It is certainly your duty to avoid the temptation as much as po&s;&s;ible, and this you can do, only by a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly avoiding every thing that reminds you of the object. Don't you know, my dear Madam, that in epidemic di&s;tempers, we are only &s;ecure, while we e&s;cape the touch of the contagious per&s;on? and with re&s;pect to wounds of the mind, they are like tho&s;e of the body; if we venture abroad too &s;oon, or, thinking our|&s;elves quite cured, if we run ha&s;tily into circum&s;tances that hurt us before, we &s;hall, in all human probability, have a return of our complaint; and a

<P>To drop, however, the language of my profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;peak as a morali&s;t, I mu&s;t every way, and by every argument, recommend it to you to lay a&s;ide the corre&s;ponding pen: every line in every letter &s;tirs the embers, which, if not meddled with would go out, till, in the end, the fatal pa&s;&s;ion which at fir&s;t kindled the original flame, would be utterly extingui&s;hed.

tears of tender congratulation into my eyes. It is the 18th of Augu&s;t! my watch, which hangs at the head of the bed, points betwixt the hours of eight and nine!

I have opened the ca&s;ement, and am &s;aluted with a breeze more balmy and &s;erene, than I ever felt in my life. There is a grape-vine run|ing along the wall, till its tendrils ambitiou&s;ly twi&s;t round my window, and come mantling into my bed|room. The foliage on the out&s;ide is
<PB N="236" REF="242">
uncommonly luxurious! and &s;ince I have been confined, a red-brea&s;t has ne&s;ted among&s;t the leaves. He is this moment in the &s;weete&s;t thrillings of his dome&s;tic &s;ong! Even &s;o near the bu&s;tle and buildings of the me|tropolis, I have all the advantages of rural life! Every thing around me &s;eems to compliment my Charlotte! What then mu&s;t I feel upon the &s;ub|ject? how mu&s;t I be touched&mdash;with what an ardent &s;incerity mu&s;t I wi&s;h this day, and every revolving one&mdash; every eighteenth of Augu&s;t&mdash;how &mdash;how, I &s;ay, mu&s;t I pray&mdash;how &s;up|plicate the powers of happine&s;s and health that

<L>That it be mark't with triumphs and rejoicings;</L>
<L>That happy lovers &s;till may make it holy</L>
<L>And ever choo&s;e it to endear remem|brance!</L></Q>
From the bottom of my heart I hail the return of this delightful morn|ing. And yet, Charlotte, how cruelly bu&s;y is fancy in the brea&s;t and brain of a man under certain influences? what a train of objects now u&s;e be|fore me? what a vi&s;ion is Imagi|nation drawing? how &s;he &s;wells upon the canva&s;s? what a glow in
<PB N="238" REF="244">
her colouring? what animation in her touches? there is character in every &s;troke of her pencil; her figures are from the life. She has a hand that throws Raphael into de&s;pair. Her exact &s;imilitudes captivate the eye, and her re&s;emblances &s;ubdue the heart!</P>
<P>Methinks I now &s;ee how Charlotte employs the pre&s;ent day; &s;he invites the numerous circles of tho&s;e that wi&s;h her well: the fea&s;t is prepared: the lovely entertainer in the bloom of beauty and youth, &s;its at the head of the table as godde&s;s of the ban|quet. She delights more by her &s;en&s;es, her wit, and her politene&s;s, than by the delicacies of her board.
<PB N="239" REF="245">
And yet can it ever Charlotte, ah! can it ever be forgotten, in what Charles u&s;ed to engage upon this day! will not his attention to the very hour, the minute&mdash;the &s;econd of her birth, be long remembered? With what a more than bridal vigilance did he watch the returns of this au&s;picious aera! how did he fondly bu&s;y him&s;elf in birth-day preparations&mdash;love con|&s;tant, exalted love in&s;pired, his con|duct upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. It was love that invited the &s;un to &s;hine on that day with a con&s;picuous lu&s;tre: it was love that provided the orna|ment, and decorating novelties which were then, for the <HI>fir&s;t time,</HI> to be worn: it was love that wept over the &s;parkling gla&s;s: love it was which

gave the congratulating ki&s;s&mdash;and it was love which &s;miled as the day clo&s;ed, and as the indulging night advanced, to give you, all accom|pli&s;hed, to my embraces.</P>
<P>Surely the&s;e recollections will, even in the mid&s;t of natal fe&s;tivity, revive tho&s;e &s;entiments in the &s;ympathizing bo&s;om of Charlotte, which will be&s;tow one tender &s;igh to the memory of affection, and</P>
