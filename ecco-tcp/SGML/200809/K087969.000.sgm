<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>CIRCUMSTANCES, which of them|&s;elves might appear trivial and in&s;ig|nificant, become highly intere&s;ting, when they are connected with, or are explana|tory of, great and important events. And &s;o great and important do I con&s;ider the di&s;covery of this precious fragment of hi&s;|tory, which I now give to the public, that I am per&s;uaded, I need offer no apo|logy, for minutely relating the manner in which it &s;o accidentally and &s;o happily fell into my hands.</P>
<P>My father having having pur&s;ued the profe&s;&s;ion of a pin-maker, with great &s;uc|ce&s;s, acquired a very hand&s;ome fortune, with which he purcha&s;ed <HI>Grub-Hatch,</HI> the
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
ancient &s;eat of the family of the <HI>Pole&s;worths.</HI> At his death I &s;ucceeded to that e&s;tate, and wi&s;hing to live as became a per&s;on of my <HI>rank</HI> and <HI>fortune,</HI> I determined like other young <HI>gentlemen,</HI> to pull to pieces, mo|derni&s;e and adorn, &s;o <HI>commodious,</HI> but &s;o <HI>antiquated</HI> a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Unluckily I was not acquainted with any fa&s;hionable architect, and was deter|mined not to be &s;o <HI>vulgar</HI> as to employ a <HI>city &s;urveyor.</HI> I concluded therefore, that my be&s;t way was to con&s;ult my <HI>Cook Maid</HI> upon this occa&s;ion: who I had always found to be a very &s;hrewd &s;en&s;ible woman, and who be&s;ides had a damned good ta&s;te of her own. Accordingly having men|tioned the &s;ubject to her one day, &s;he told me, That &s;he had formerly lived with a family in Mary-le-bone, and that in one of the &s;treets there, &s;he remembered to have &s;een a very <HI>ta&s;ty</HI> hou&s;e, built on a <HI>new principle,</HI> by a very famous and fa|&s;hionable <HI>Architector,</HI> who&s;e name &s;he had forgot, but &s;he remembered to have of|ten admired his hou&s;e as being uncom|monly
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
<HI>crips and nic't</HI> and not in the lea&s;t like a <HI>dwelling hou&s;e,</HI> for it looked for all the world like a chapel. From this account, which plea&s;ed me, I determined to enquire after this great arti&s;t, and hav|ing gone on purpo&s;e to look at his hou&s;e, I &s;aw it an&s;wered preci&s;ely to my <HI>cook maid's</HI> de&s;cription. I next went to look at an addition by him made to a great man's hou&s;e adjoining to the river, and from the &s;kill and dexterity with which I ob&s;erved the arti&s;t had there avoided all regularity, proportion, ta&s;te and elegance, I concluded he mu&s;t have a perfect knowledge of his art, to enable him to deviate from all its rules and all its beauties, with &s;uch inge|nuity and correctne&s;s. I did not therefore hezitate a moment in determining that this was the proper per&s;on for me to em|ploy.</P>
<P>Accordingly he came to my hou&s;e and gave me a mon&s;truous beautiful de&s;ign for taking away all my old towers, turrets and battlements, and every thing el&s;e which gavemy hou&s;e an appearance of antiquity
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
or of old fa&s;hioned magnificence, and in their &s;tead, he &s;ub&s;tituted venetian and palladian windows, ballu&s;trades and pi|la&s;ters, and in &s;hort, every thing that is hand&s;ome, modern and toni&s;h. I was per|fectly charmed with all this when an ac|cident happened, which had nearly made me frantic, and cur&s;e my architect for an illiterate booby, who de&s;erved to be buried in one of his deepe&s;t foundations.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure the public will forgive my rage, when I relate that one day, my workmen in pulling down part of a round tower, came to a &s;mall concealed clo&s;et in the wall, in which was lodged, a very old iron che&s;t, with a ru&s;ty padlock up|on it.</P>
<P>They immediately concluded, they had found a trea&s;ure, and propo&s;ed to take an oath of &s;ecrecy to each other re&s;pecting the contents&mdash;but one of them cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Damn it, let us fir&s;t &s;ee if there is any thing in the che&s;t worth &s;wearing about
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
&mdash;let us open him and examine his belly."</Q> This they did by &s;triking off the padlock, when upon lifting up the lid&mdash;lo, there was nothing to be found but a parcel of old mu&s;ty papers in manu&s;cript, much decayed from age, very damp, and almo&s;t peri&s;hed for want of air. At this critical moment, my architect entering the tower, enquired of the workmen what they were about. They being extremely di&s;ap|pointed at neither finding gold nor &s;ilver, told him they had ju&s;t di&s;covered a parcel of old dirty papers, not worth a t&mdash;d. Let me &s;ee them, &s;ays he, and then turning over &s;ome leaves, he reads on the title page, <Q REND="inline">"The hi&s;tory of <HI>John Bull,</HI>"</Q> but the ignorant nincompoop, never having before heard of the name of that illu&s;trious per&s;on, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Ay, this is a cock and a bull &s;tory indeed."</Q> And reading &s;till farther, he came to tho&s;e beautiful and well &s;elected lines of Ovid; upon which he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"That this was &s;ome damned greek or latin jargon,"</Q> which he thanked God he knew nothing about, <Q REND="inline">"and there|fore,
<PB N="x" REF="8">
(&s;ays he,) as the paper is very <HI>nice</HI> and <HI>&s;oft,</HI> I will carry it to town with me, and &s;hall do, what perhaps the author could not have done for him&s;elf, for I &s;hall cer|tainly tran&s;mit his work to <HI>po&s;terity.</HI>"</Q> Having pronounced this wittici&s;m with an air of &s;elf-applau&s;e, he began to bundle up his papers, when by the mo&s;t accidental &s;troke of good luck, I came, &s;auntering into the place!&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What have you got here,"</Q> good Sir? &s;ays I. <Q REND="inline">"Nothing worth looking at,"</Q> replied the arti&s;t, telling me, at the &s;ame time where and how the&s;e old fu&s;ty papers, as he was plea&s;ed to call them, had been di&s;covered. This rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity, and having read the title page, and the learned hi&s;torian's quotation from Ovid, I jumped for joy, and exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"By God, I have found a trea&s;ure!"</Q> upon this, I ob&s;erved both my architect and workmen began to &s;tare at me, and at one|another, like &s;o many &s;tuck pigs. At length the arti&s;t addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, <Q REND="inline">"Are the&s;e Sir,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">Title deeds which we have now di&s;covered?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Title
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
devils,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline">you had nearly ruined me, by your ignorance; but thank God I came in time to &s;ave this valuable work!"</Q> and then collecting the mouldy &s;heets, away I capered to my &s;tudy, in a tran&s;port of joy, and immediately &s;et my&s;elf down to read over this admirable performance.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceived that the air began to have a &s;en&s;ible effect upon the &s;heets of my manu&s;cript, as they became &s;o tender, it was with difficulty they could bear turn|ning over. I was therefore under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity to &s;et about tran&s;cribing the whole with great care and fidelity, altering not a word nor a &s;yllable, nor even a letter of this excellent and ju&s;tly admired hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>I may therefore boa&s;t with great truth, that &s;uch as I found it, I give it to the world, uninjured, unaltered, unimpaired. At what time this fragment was origi|nally wrote, I leave to the conjectures and inve&s;tigation of the learned and inge|nious. Neither &s;hall I pretend to decide what period of the life and tran&s;actions of
<PB N="xii" REF="10">
the illu&s;trious <HI>John Bull,</HI> is here narrated. I do not mean to indulge conjecture. Our hi&s;torian has him&s;elf hinted, that he treats of a period of that great man's exi&s;tence, when he was rather verging to|wards dotage. Indeed the incon&s;i&s;tency of his conduct, as here related, with the whole tenor of his former life and conver|&s;ation, affords but too good ground to ju&s;tify our author's ob&s;ervation. Nor does even his nuptials, with the young, the proud, the haughty and a&s;&s;uming Mi&s;s Prerogative, in any way di&s;prove, but ra|ther confirms what our author has ad|vanced.</P>
<P>But what above all &s;erves to e&s;tabli&s;h this fact, is, the vi&s;ible decline of that great man's mental faculties, to that de|gree, as to allow him&s;elf to be compleatly deceived and led blindfold by the nur&s;e, of whom he was wont to entertain &s;o root|ed a jealou&s;y, and to permit her, without oppo&s;ition, to employ for his &s;teward, an ignorant &s;chool boy, altogether unac|quainted with mankind, and un&s;killed in
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;And this at a time, when <HI>John</HI>'s affairs were much embroiled, and his fi|nances almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, by continual ex|pen&s;ive and vexatious litigations. So that really if there was in his family, one man with more wi&s;dom, experience and know|ledge than another, this was undoubtedly the time to have called for an exertion of his abilities.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, we all know, that <HI>John</HI>'s great failings from his infancy, were ra&s;hne&s;s and precipitancy, and that he was credulous to a degree, &s;carcely con|&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e. The&s;e foibles expo&s;ed him &s;adly to the malicious and fa|bricated reports of talebearers, go&s;&s;ips, &s;landerers and liars, and are prominent features of his character, which our author has here mo&s;t admirably depicted.</P>
<P>I once propo&s;ed to have pre&s;ented the engli&s;h reader, with a tran&s;lation of our author's quotation from Ovid; but not finding my&s;elf quite equal to the ta&s;k, I applied to our par&s;on, who is reckoned a
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
very <HI>pretty</HI> &s;cholar. However, his ver&s;ion did not altogether plea&s;e me, and I dropped my de&s;ign. He for in&s;tance, had tran&s;lated <HI>Occa&s;us, Ireland;</HI> and <HI>Ortus,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> This I objected to, ob&s;erving, that although Ovid might very probably have heard of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> yet I could not imagine that he had ever heard, or read much about <HI>Ireland.</HI> And for this and other rea&s;ons, I determined to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of an Engli&s;h ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have only farther to add, that although I have con&s;idered it as a pious duty which I owed to the manes of &s;o great an hi&s;torian to give his work to the public, without hazarding the &s;malle&s;t alteration, yet I am not &s;o blinded by the brilliant merit of this celebrated writer, as not to confe&s;s that many inaccuracies have crept into his work; which in candour and fairne&s;s, we ought &s;urely to attribute to his not having had &s;ufficient lei&s;ure before his death, to re|duce it into a &s;tate of fini&s;hed correctne&s;s. We mu&s;t therefore view this little frag|ment of hi&s;tory as the precious and &s;pi|rited
<PB N="xv" REF="13">
&s;ketch of a great painter, which had not yet received the la&s;t and mo&s;t correc|tive &s;trokes of his pencil, and where un|happily for mankind, too few of the wi&s;hed for <HI>pentimenti</HI> appear: and where &s;till more unhappily, the ample canvas is left unfilled with the grand and glorious compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If the peru&s;al of this curious and inter|e&s;ting fragment &s;hould afford as much en|tertainment and &s;atisfaction to the public, as it has done to me, I &s;hall e&s;teem my|&s;elf amply rewarded for all my trouble in the publication.</P>

<HEAD>THE DEDICATION. To the Rt. Hon. William Pitt, Fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury, and Chancellor of the Ex|chequer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t &s;ublime and wonderful SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Once intended to have given to the Public, the following fragment of the hi&s;tory of that mo&s;t excellent and eminent trade&s;man, <HI>John Bull,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> without &s;eek|ing for any great or powerful patron, un|der who&s;e protection, it might be u&s;hered into the world, with greater lu&s;tre and eclat. I had indeed almo&s;t per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that &s;o authentic an hi&s;tory of that great man, written by &s;o admirable an author as <HI>Sir Humphry Pole&s;worth,</HI> who&s;e
<PB N="xviii" REF="15">
character, as an able and faithful hi&s;to|rian, has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond all the effort of cavil and critici&s;m, could not require any &s;uch extraordinary recom|mendation to a nation of trade&s;men, who&s;e chief glory con&s;i&s;ts in having, like the ce|lebrated <HI>John Bull,</HI> made their way thro' all difficulties, by a mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous and laborious indu&s;try.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t I was ruminating upon this matter, it &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to my imagina|tion, that it would be much more fa&s;hion|able to prefix a dedication to this mo&s;t ine&s;timable work.&mdash;Fa&s;hion, &s;ir, which has &s;uch influence over great minds, at once determined me, and I could not help recollecting with plea&s;ure, that even you your&s;elf, was, during la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of par|liament, prompted by this powerful mo|tive, to &s;ave the national credit, by pay|ing the navy and victualling bill-holders at par, which no other con&s;ideration on earth, but fa&s;hion, could have induced you to have done.</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="16">
This, &s;ir, has al&s;o prevailed upon me to attempt this daring mea&s;ure of dedica|tion. But how to approach you in terms of adequate eulogy, is that which creates my greate&s;t difficulty. I am &s;en&s;ible that I cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay any thing very new upon a &s;ubject, where you your&s;elf and &s;o many other ingenious &s;tate&s;men and ora|tors, have been exhau&s;ting <HI>all</HI> the mo&s;t pompous expre&s;&s;ions and ful&s;ome figures, to be&s;tow prai&s;e.</P>
<P>In this dangerous &s;ituation, coming over t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lf-&s;ame ground, I am afraid I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ntly incur the reproach of plagi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;m. Sir Richard Hill, for in&s;tance, that &s;ublime Prophet, Preacher and Poet, has unhappily anticipated a very grand idea, which I had formed concerning you, and which indeed neither he nor I, need to plume our&s;elves much upon, &s;ince it mu&s;t be obvious, and will naturally oc|cur to every one who will give them&s;elves a moment's reflection: I mean that &s;ub|lime
<PB N="xx" REF="17">
idea, by him &s;o beautifully expre&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"That Old England, and the Son of Old Chatham, mu&s;t fall together!"</Q> It is in|deed a very true, but a very mortifying con&s;ideration, to think that both the&s;e melancholly events cannot be at any great di&s;tance.
<Q><L>Durum: &s;ed levius fit patientia,</L>
<L>Quidquid corrigere e&s;t nefas;</L></Q></P>
<P>But, great &s;ir, allow me to &s;ay, that however true, and however &s;ublime this idea, yet was it extremely imprudent in our friend Sir Richard, to have mentioned this matter in &s;o public an a&s;&s;embly, when it is well known, that there is one Per&s;on in the kingdom, &s;till greater than your&s;elf, who may have taken the alarm at this po&s;ition; and who I verily believe would be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of mankind, did he con&s;ider you as a fixture to the premi&s;es, not moveable at plea&s;ure. The very e&s;&s;ence of authority for which he has been &s;truggling with &s;o much zeal;
<PB N="xxi" REF="18">
vigour and duplicity, ever &s;ince you was born.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides by thus divulging the grand ar|canum of the empire, the worthy baron|et has expo&s;ed us to our enemies, who, I have no doubt, &s;hould you fall, would be ready to invade us by &s;ea and land; nay, perhaps by air; thus rendering, by means of balloons, our in&s;ular &s;ituation, no &s;ecurity again&s;t our aero&s;tatic foes.</P>
<P>But while I thus de&s;cant upon your a|mazing utility to the &s;tate, I forget the principal purport of this dedication, which was to declare to you, that you may de|pend upon me, as being attached to you and you alone, for the re&s;t of my life, unle&s;s any thing of greater advantage than your patronage, &s;hould tempt me to &s;eek for protection el&s;ewhere: In which ca&s;e I am &s;ure, even your little knowledge of mankind, will prevent you from expect|ing any farther friend&s;hip from me. In|deed almo&s;t all of your pre&s;ent fa&s;t friends,
<PB N="xxii" REF="19">
may from pa&s;t experience teach you this important le&s;&s;on. The Trea&s;urer of the Navy, after trying all parties, clings to you, as mo&s;t u&s;eful to him&s;elf and <HI>to the &s;tate.</HI> The Lord Chancellor, Lord Gower, the Duke of Richmond, the Rat Catcher, and all Lord North's quondam band of <HI>illu&s;trious contractors,</HI> under&s;tand this max|im compleatly; and permit me to add, the greate&s;t of all examples, virtuous and immaculate &s;ir, that you your&s;elf, when intere&s;t and ambition lead the way, can wheel from privilege to prerogative, with a crane neck on a new principle, by let|ters patent, <HI>under the Great Seal.</HI> And what was &s;o well &s;aid of a former popular mini&s;ter in this country, may with equal ju&s;tice be applied to your immaculate Self&mdash;<Q><L>Now he'll command, and now obey,</L>
<L>Bellows for liberty to-day;</L>
<L>And roars for power to-morrow.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="20">
But again I forget my&s;elf on this be|witching &s;ubject&mdash;I forget that I write a dedication, and allow my&s;elf to be hurried down the rapid &s;tream of di&s;&s;ertation. Permit me only to add in your own cla&s;|&s;ical and elegant &s;tile, that if I have mi&s;&s;ed any portion of prai&s;e, I &s;hould have be|&s;towed, I do a&s;&s;ure you it was not from any intention of <HI>blinking</HI> this favorite &s;ub|ject.&mdash;Con&s;ider it, great Sir, as a mark of my impotence rather than any failure of my de&s;ires.&mdash;</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to be with the mo&s;t profound veneration and adoration, divine and immaculate SIR, your mo&s;t devoted and ob&s;equious &s;ervant,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>John Bull's age&mdash;His pen&s;ive and &s;en&s;ible &s;olilo|quy&mdash;Some prominent features of his character de&s;cribed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JOHN BULL,</HI> was now arrived at that time of life, when people begin to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome of the follies incident to human na|ture may not improperly be imputed to a &s;ort of premature dotage. Be that as it may, there was no per&s;on of acute penetration, but might perceive that this great and good man, was rather verging towards the wane of life&mdash;The tedious, irk&s;ome and un&s;ucce&s;&s;full law&s;uit, which he had carried on, with his ungrateful and ra&s;cally tenants, in the we&s;t country, who in order to ca&s;t <HI>John,</HI> had been &s;upplied both with ca&s;h and with coun&s;el by his old and in|veterate enemy, <HI>Louis Baboon,</HI> and others, had fretted <HI>John</HI> to the very guts: and then the di&s;graceful manner in which that bu&s;ine&s;s had been compromi&s;ed, by <HI>Malagrida,</HI> his late &s;teward, had hurt his feelings very much. For to &s;ay truth, <HI>John</HI> was e'en as humane a good hearted fellow, as you would &s;ee among&s;t a thou&s;and. He was frequently &s;een walking in a pen&s;ive mood, backwards and forwards, through his
<PB N="4" REF="30">
hall, at <HI>Bullock's hatch,</HI> and was often over-heard muttering to him&s;elf, &s;omewhat to the follow|ing purpos&s;e,</P>
<P>Zounds! My people might at lea&s;t have taken &s;ome care of tho&s;e poor tenan's of mine in the we&s;t country, who really befriended my cau&s;e; but to leave them to be turned out of their farms&mdash;To be dragged from their hou&s;es and homes; nay, even to have many of their throats cut by tho&s;e inhuman and lawle&s;s ban|ditti their neighbours, appears to me a mo&s;t &s;hocking bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;Oh, <HI>John Bull&mdash;John Bull,</HI> thou art &s;adly di&s;graced by thy &s;ervants!&mdash;But damn it, what could I expect from that infa|mous, hardened &s;coundrel <HI>Malagrida</HI>&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e he found it nece&s;&s;ary for him&s;elf, that matters &s;hould be made up&mdash;No doubt he and his a&s;&s;ociate, that &s;upple loon <HI>Harry Mac Bum|bo</HI>&mdash;have filled their pockets by it.</P>
<P>Well, I do really think one of the be&s;t things ever my poor wife did for me; was the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e knaves from my &s;ervice. I know the nur&s;e has a &s;ort of &s;neaking kindne&s;s for that fellow <HI>Malagrida,</HI> for he has a cur&s;ed artful wheedling tongue, can flatter ye by the hour, and lie like the very devil&mdash;When it &s;erves his purpo&s;e&mdash;For my own part, I can't
<PB N="5" REF="31">
&s;ay I ever had a good opinion of the dog&mdash;I like people of my own temper&mdash;fair, open and above board: nothing hidden or concealed. At the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am &s;o far of the nur&s;e's way of thinking, that it appears to me a very ridiculous thing, to &s;ee my old friends, <HI>Boreas</HI> and young <HI>Renard,</HI> &s;o cordial and &s;haking hands together, after giving one another the lye &s;o often in my wife's hearing, and calling one another all the bad names they could invent. This to be &s;ure is &s;omewhat very extraordinary and almo&s;t convinces me that the&s;e gentry fall in, and fall out, ju&s;t as their own intere&s;t directs them, without much mind|ing my good, or that of my family. I believe verily they are all rogues together; that I take to be the plain Engli&s;h of it.&mdash;Not but that I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, I think both <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Re|nard,</HI> are very clever fellows, as any ever I had within my doors&mdash;<HI>Boreas,</HI> I always took to be a good humoured, droll, facetious fellow with a va&s;t of wit, great parts and great expe|rience in my affairs, and had always a deal to &s;ay for him&s;elf. He was once as well with the nur&s;e, as any man alive, that is, while the obey|ed all her orders implicitly, much again&s;t his own inclination. But now I know &s;he hates him like the devil for his junction with <HI>Renard,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="32">
and the more he acts like a man of honour, in his new connection, &s;he will like him the wor&s;e&mdash;for &s;he's a proud, ob&s;tinate vin|dictive, old b&mdash;, as ever exi&s;ted. Well hang her, if I care a damn whether &s;he's plea&s;ed or no, if they agree &s;o as to manage my affairs to good purpo&s;e; for I am &s;ure they never required more care, attention and ability, than at pre&s;ent, to get me out of the cur&s;ed &s;crape I am now in, for which I have to thank her pride and ob&s;tinacy, and be damned to her, lead|ing me in to all this fooli&s;h, ab&s;urd litigation, with &s;uch a &s;et of ra&s;cally ungrateful &s;cound|rels&mdash;And now I have got a compleat verdict again&s;t me with exorbitant co&s;ts of fuit, and where all this immen&s;e &s;um is to come from, God only knows.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>John</HI> went on in a &s;oliloquy that had no end, when he was in the&s;e gloomy pen&s;ive moods, and the&s;e recurred, but too frequently of late, for he really felt his &s;ituation grievous, un&s;ucce&s;sful in his law&s;uit, and up to the eyes in debt. What was his only confort, and I &s;in|cerely believe he felt it as a real comfort at this time, was to think that his affairs were now both in active and able hands, for al|though he was at fir&s;t &s;omewhat hurt at the
<PB N="7" REF="33">
&s;udden coalition of <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard</HI>&mdash;yet he was &s;oon reconciled to it, and u&s;ed to confe&s;s what was true, that it was very much his own temper to forgive injuries, and forget animo|&s;ities&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ays he, that being both open, frank, and good humoured, they have agreed to meet with &s;ome mutual friends over a bottle, and to &s;hake hands, and forget all former quarrels"</Q>&mdash;Be&s;ides, &s;ays <HI>John,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"My wife, who is a very, di&s;creet &s;en&s;ible wo|man, has a high opinion of them both, and has frequently told me, &s;he was perfectly &s;ure, that it was their &s;incere affection for me, that prompted them to &s;o unexpected a reconcili|ation, for that they could not bear to &s;ee my affairs &s;o bungled and bedeviled as they were by that &s;ad dog <HI>Malagrida,</HI> and his profligate a&s;&s;ociate <HI>Harry Mac Bumbo,</HI> with young <HI>Pam,</HI> his apprentice."</Q> Such was the language which <HI>John Bull</HI> u&s;ed to hold once and again on this &s;ubject. But alas his &s;atisfaction and peace of mind, were not long lived, as we &s;hall &s;ee by the &s;equel of this u&s;eful and authentic hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>For there it will be found, that though <HI>John Bull,</HI> was as &s;en&s;ible and as well meaning a trade&s;man as any you would wi&s;h to &s;ee or conver&s;e withal, and one who under&s;tood his
<PB N="8" REF="34">
own bu&s;ine&s;s thoroughly, and had a &s;ort of a &s;matter of every thing&mdash;Yet had he a mo&s;t un|fortunate temper for his own intere&s;t: by which means he often marred the be&s;t concerted plans, and even &s;o it happened now. <HI>John</HI> with a very large &s;hare of good &s;en&s;e, was of all mankind, the mo&s;t credulous. You could by art and per&s;ua&s;ion, and a competent portion of effrontery, make him &s;wallow down any thing, however ab&s;urd and improbable. This un|lucky temper, had made <HI>John,</HI> the con&s;tant dupe, of every quack of every profe&s;&s;ion, who could get acquainted with him. Should any man &s;ay and a&s;&s;ert it boldly, that he could go into a quart bottle, <HI>John</HI> would immediately give ear to it. Ay, and would have rode or run a hundred miles, to have &s;een this admirable trick performed. If another would pretend that he could pay off all his debts, in the cour&s;e of a few years, <HI>John</HI> would gape and li&s;ten to him, with the greate&s;t attention.</P>
<P>This foible of <HI>John</HI>'s, was well known in the family, and not this foible only, otherwi&s;e it might have pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed, as not being at|tended with any very bad con&s;equences; but added to this, <HI>John</HI> was of that violent and pre|cipitate temper, that without the lea&s;t exami|nation into the rea&s;onablene&s;s, or truth, or
<PB N="9" REF="35">
probability of what he heard, he would imme|diately &s;et to work and enter upon the execu|tion of any new project, with as much ardour and zeal, as if he had the be&s;t authority for it. Nor would he hear a &s;ingle &s;yllable from any friend, who advi&s;ed him to think of the mat|ter and to take time to deliberate and con&s;ider what he was about. Many a &s;coundrel had taken great advantage of the&s;e failings, to their own emolument and <HI>John</HI>'s di&s;grace. Yet he never grew wi&s;er from experience, but the next comer, that would talk beg enough, and boa&s;t of his own knowledge and talents, was &s;ure to meet the mo&s;t favorable reception from <HI>John,</HI> who &s;wallowed every &s;pecies of rodo|montade as if it had been go&s;pel, and never would give him&s;elf time to reflect on the con|&s;equences of &s;uch egregious folly and non|&s;en&s;e.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard,</HI> &s;et them&s;elves in good earn|e&s;t to arrange <HI>John Bull's</HI> affairs. Short Hi&s;+tory of the Ea&s;t country clerks&mdash;Their extreme vigilance and avarice de&s;cribed&mdash;Serious intention to clean&s;e the counting-hou&s;e, which is prevented by <HI>John Bull's</HI> nur&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOT only the &s;enfible and thinking part of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s own family, but likewi&s;e all the neighbours to a man, agreed that he had been extremely lucky in having his affairs put into &s;uch able hands as tho&s;e of <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard,</HI> and tho&s;e who really wi&s;hed him well, were happy in congratulating him upon this event; an event which he owed entirely to the good &s;en&s;e, prudence and di&s;cretion of Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> who in every action of her life, had &s;hown great dignity, and independence and an unremitting zeal for her hu&s;band's welfare&mdash;Nobody knew better than her, the embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of <HI>John</HI>'s affairs, and it was univer&s;ally allowed that &s;he could not have put them into better or abler hands, than into tho&s;e of <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard,</HI> who to their talents and expe|rience, added great zeal to exert them&s;elves in arranging <HI>John</HI>'s finances, in &s;ettling his
<PB N="11" REF="37">
books, ballancing his accompts, and in ex|tending and regulating his trade. But what mo&s;t of all required their immediate attention, was the &s;trange bu&s;ine&s;s and abu&s;es that had crept into <HI>John</HI>'s counting hou&s;e, where a &s;et of his clerks had been carrying on a rare &s;pot of work, and finding that <HI>John</HI> was too much engaged in law to give them any great attention, they had entered into the &s;adde&s;t &s;cenes of peculation, plunder, knavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, that ever were heard of, in a chri&s;|tian country. The&s;e fellows contrived a plan, by which they thought they might be con&s;ide|rable gainers without hurting <HI>John</HI> in the &s;mal|le&s;t degree. Ob&s;erving therefore that there was a &s;et of lazy lubbardly Ea&s;t-country &s;quires, who were not cleverly &s;upplied with <HI>John</HI>'s goods, and who had al&s;o many commodities, the produce of their farms, which they ima|gined would be u&s;eful to <HI>John</HI> in return, they propo&s;ed to take the carrying on this traffic off <HI>John</HI>'s hands, to free him from the trouble and expence of it, promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, to bring the whole produce and profits to <HI>Bul|lock</HI>'s-<HI>hatch,</HI> by which not only they, but al&s;o <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf would reap very great advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="38">
This project plea&s;ed <HI>John</HI> hugely and his wife &s;till more, for the ladies are always capti|vated by wonderful adventures, and romantic and difficult exploits, which I am convinced, may have been partly the cau&s;e of their great and ardent de&s;ire of travelling into <HI>Scotland</HI> with &s;o much rapidity and eagerne&s;s, as has often happened in former times.</P>
<P><HI>John Bull,</HI> and his wife were therefore perfectly agreed, in granting to the&s;e &s;ame crafty clerks, an exclu&s;ive privilege to carry on this traffic, with the afore&s;aid '&s;quires. To work went the clerks with a greedy indu&s;try, and traded away at a va&s;t rate, till they acquired great riches and a greater name. Then it was, that many of the young &s;ervants about <HI>John</HI>'s family, wi&s;hed to be &s;ent out, that they al&s;o might have opportunities of pu&s;hing their fortunes. And accordingly, great numbers of &s;prightly younkers, were &s;ent who being extremely intent upon the neate&s;t way of filling their pur&s;es, they bethought them&s;elves, that trade was not the only method by which large for|tunes could be acquired, but that it might be to the full as good, and as expeditious a way to get rid of the ea&s;tern &s;quires altogether, by foul or by fair means, no matter which, and
<PB N="13" REF="39">
&s;o to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates for them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>This &s;ucceeded to a miracle, for in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, our &s;pirited <HI>Younkers,</HI> &s;tabbed &s;ome, &s;hot others, poi&s;oned, &s;old, impri&s;oned, betrayed, bribed, bullied and trampled down, to &s;uch a pitch, that they made them&s;elves ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of whole pari&s;hes. And &s;o powerful, and &s;o rich were they become by this management, that nobody in that part of the country, and far le&s;s at <HI>Bullock's-hatch,</HI> dared to &s;ay a word again&s;t them, or find any fault whatever, with their proceedings.</P>
<P>In this way, you would often &s;ee &s;trange low-lived fellows, &s;uch as chee&s;e-monger's|boys, waiters at taverns, alehou&s;e-keeper's &s;ons, and the like, after they had been &s;ome years in the ea&s;t country, and being what the <HI>Scots</HI> call &s;harp loons, they would pillage and pe|culate, and plunder, and cheat their poor op|pre&s;t tenantry, to &s;uch a degree that in the cour&s;e of two or three years, they would re|turn to <HI>Bullock's-hatch,</HI> with great evergrown fortunes, where you might often have &s;een them &s;trutting about the <HI>hall,</HI> and the parlours, and giving them&s;elves incredible airs, as if
<PB N="14" REF="40">
<HI>John Bull</HI> him&s;elf had been nothing compared with them. Nay, they were even &s;o amazingly pert and forward, from their &s;ucce&s;s, that they would have had the impudence to take out a gold pa&s;s key, which they u&s;ually brought home with them, and wore in their breeches pocket, with which they would at times turn the latch of Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s chamber door, and walk in, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and familiarity, and would then &s;et them&s;elves down upon the fir&s;t &s;eat that came in their way, without &s;o much as &s;aying with your leave, or by your leave. If Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> took no notice of them, it was nothing to tho&s;e gentry, if &s;he, or any of her &s;ervants &s;poke to them, they would begin and chatter away, as fa&s;t as any of the family could do for their hearts or &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Now it &s;o happened, that ju&s;t at this time tho&s;e cunning clerks were running a fine ca|reer of rapine, perfidy and peculation, greatly to their own emolument, but to the eternal di&s;grace of <HI>John Bull,</HI> and his family. In &s;o|much, that not only <HI>John</HI>'s wife, family, and friends, but likewi&s;e all the neighbours were crying &s;hame upon him, for not better regu|lating the conduct of his &s;ervants. There &s;eemed therefore to be an univer&s;al de&s;ire in
<PB N="15" REF="41">
the family, to &s;ee an end put to the&s;e &s;ad &s;cenes of plunder and oppre&s;&s;ion, deva&s;tation and ruin.</P>
<P>But nobody was more &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;|&s;ity of a reform than <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard.</HI> Mr. <HI>Whigman,</HI> the &s;teward, a very hone&s;t man, had it al&s;o much at heart, and promi&s;ed all his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to carry on this mea&s;ure. Nor did any one about the family pretend more zeal for it than <HI>John</HI>'s nur&s;e, a per&s;on of a very &s;ingular character, who in order to indulge in one favorite pa&s;&s;ion, could with plea&s;ure &s;a|crifice to it, every con&s;ideration, and com|pleatly di&s;gui&s;e every other feeling of her mind. To this ruling pa&s;&s;ion was owing the part we &s;hall now &s;ee her play in <HI>John</HI>'s affairs, the extraordinary means &s;he u&s;ed to prevent the propo&s;ed reform, and the curious &s;teps &s;he took to over&s;et Mr. <HI>Whigman, Boreas, Re|nard,</HI> and the re&s;t of <HI>John</HI>'s able&s;t, and mo&s;t tru&s;ty &s;ervants.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to this part of my authentic hi&s;tory, it is very nece&s;&s;ary for the better under&s;tanding of future events that I &s;hould here relate a few particulars re&s;pecting <HI>John Bull</HI>'s nur&s;e, and the great &s;way &s;he bore in his family.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Herenhau&s;en,</HI> for that was the name of the nur&s;e, was by the father's &s;ide, of <HI>German</HI> extraction, and of an exceeding good family, both by father and mother, and very &s;en&s;ible was &s;he of it her&s;elf, and very vain of &s;uch pre-eminence. Her father died when &s;he was yet a child, and &s;o the care of her education fell to her mother, and to one <HI>Sawney Macthane,</HI> a queer, proud, pompous and pedantic fellow, formerly of &s;i&s;ter <HI>Peg</HI>'s family. This ta&s;k, <HI>Sawney,</HI> undertook with great plea&s;ure, and in|&s;tilled many of his own extravagant and fan|ta&s;tic
<PB N="17" REF="43">
notions into the girls head&mdash;by telling her that &s;he might expect one day or another, to have great power in <HI>John Bull</HI>'s family, and how &s;he ought to manage to drive, or lead him&mdash;and how &s;he ought to have all his &s;ervants of her own chu&s;ing, and never to permit either <HI>John</HI> or his <HI>Wife</HI> to make choice of any. <Q REND="inline">"And if ever it &s;o happens,"</Q> &s;aid <HI>Sawney,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that they &s;hould claim &s;uch privileges, you &s;hould ne|ver re&s;t, night or day, till you can get them di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and new ones put in their places; for that is the only rule, for maintaining ab&s;olute power in <HI>John</HI>'s family."</Q> And indeed it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this maxim of <HI>Sawney</HI>'s, was not a bad one, for procuring and maintaining power in any private family.</P>
<P>It fell out, ju&s;t as <HI>Sawney</HI> had foretold; for he, like many more of <HI>Peg</HI>'s family, was endued with a curious talent, called the &s;econd &s;ight. In &s;hort, the <HI>nur&s;e</HI> got a place in <HI>John</HI>'s hou&s;e, and &s;he &s;o improved it, what from her own natural temper, what from <HI>Sawney</HI>'s in&s;truc|tions, that &s;he &s;oon acquired great &s;way there, and her word pa&s;&s;ed for a law among&s;t all the &s;ervants, who &s;tood much in awe of her, and cringed, curt&s;ied and bowed to her, more than they did to <HI>John Bull</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="44">
This naturally increa&s;ed the <HI>nur&s;e</HI>'s pride and high notions of her own dignity and importance. And <HI>Sawney</HI>'s maxim re&s;pecting the manage|ment of the &s;ervants had made &s;uch an im|pre&s;&s;ion upon her mind, that it was never ab&s;ent from her imagination. So that from the love of &s;way, and <HI>John</HI> and his <HI>Wife</HI>'s ea&s;y tempers, the old woman was become ex|tremely in&s;olent, imperious and &s;o ob&s;tinate withal, that you might well &s;ee &s;he had a good portion of the <HI>German</HI> blood in her veins.</P>
<P>From this arrogance and pride, &s;he had fir&s;t engaged <HI>John</HI> in that fatal law&s;uit, with his tenants in the <HI>we&s;t country,</HI> her cur&s;ed ob&s;ti|nacy was the cau&s;e of its being carried on, and her damned pa&s;&s;ion for choo&s;ing every per&s;on in <HI>John</HI>'s &s;ervice, was the rea&s;on why &s;he al&s;o took upon her to name <HI>John</HI>'s lawyers and at|torneys, and &s;o furni&s;hed him with as compleat a &s;et of rogues and petty-foggers, as any poor litigious man was ever ble&s;&s;ed with.</P>
<P>Never was there a plainer or clearer ca&s;e, than that of <HI>John</HI>'s, and if it was nece&s;&s;ary to go to law, which many &s;en&s;ible men thought neither nece&s;&s;ary nor prudent; yet certainly the action being once brought and the &s;uit com|menced, every one mu&s;t acknowledge <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="45">
was confoundedly ill u&s;ed by his coun&s;el, who run him to immoderate expence, without hav|ing genius or capacity, and without even in|clination to take one deci&s;ive &s;tep that might bring this affair to a fortunate i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>However all tho&s;e rare gentry were the choice of the nur&s;e, and therefore tho' <HI>John</HI> growled, he was determined to &s;ee it to an end, but Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> being at length heartily tired, and com|plaining mo&s;t grievou&s;ly of the immoderate ex|pence, &s;he was fully determined to bring mat|ters to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion&mdash;and the nur&s;e &s;ee|ing &s;he could not help her&s;elf, employed <HI>Ma|lagrida</HI> to compromi&s;e the affair, which he did, in &s;o &s;candalous and bungling a manner, as both to di&s;gu&s;t Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> which occa&s;ioned his di&s;grace and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Then it was that old <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard,</HI> determined gloriou&s;ly to &s;ave <HI>John</HI> and the family from more mi&s;chief, by making up all their former quarrels, and forgetting or for|giving pa&s;t injuries. Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> who was as well conditioned a woman as ever lived, was extremely happy at this reconciliation, for &s;he &s;aw the great advantage it would be of to her hu&s;band's affairs. But <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf, was not near &s;o clear about it, and u&s;ed to rea&s;on and
<PB N="20" REF="46">
growl concerning it, exactly in the manner we have de&s;cribed above, &s;ometimes he thought it perfectly right, &s;ometimes he thought it quite wrong, and alledged, that it was highly indecent and improper for two good-natured men, to make up their former quarrels in order to &s;erve him and his family.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> however, in this matter, judged much more di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately and &s;en&s;ibly, and knowing the great merit of the parties, &s;he &s;trongly recommended their being employed in the future &s;ettlement of <HI>John</HI>'s affairs; which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to conceive how much the nur&s;e was enraged at this proceeding, for tho' &s;he had been made privy to it, and had coldly a&s;|&s;ented, yet &s;he had not been the per&s;on to pro|po&s;e the mea&s;ure. In &s;hort, the propo&s;ition came from Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> to whom &s;he had a very great di&s;like, as we &s;hall &s;ee more fully here|after. And altho' &s;he had borne her no ill will whatever, &s;till it was Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s, and not her own propo&s;al.</P>
<P>However, as &s;he was from her infancy a per|fect mi&s;tre&s;s of di&s;&s;imulation. &s;he pretended intire &s;atisfaction and acquie&s;cence with all
<PB N="21" REF="47">
the family arrangements now taking place, affected great good humour, and put on the air of compleat reconciliation and complacency.</P>
<P>All this time however, &s;he harboured ven|geance in her mind&mdash;&s;he vowed revenge, for being naturally extremely vindictive, &s;he wait|ed with impatience a favourable opportunity, when &s;he might put her de&s;igns into ex|ecution, and &s;oothe her implacable re&s;entment, as we &s;hall &s;ee by the &s;equel of this eventful hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Nur&s;e makes choice of Pam, as the in&s;trument of her vengeance&mdash;His education and character&mdash;He conver&s;es with Mrs. Bull&mdash;Is di&s;concerted at his cool reception&mdash;Is comforted by his Cou&s;in Trim Stutter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE nur&s;e immediately fixed her eyes upon a young lad, bred in <HI>John</HI>'s compting-hou&s;e, as a fit in&s;trument for her purpo&s;ed re|venge. And &s;o he was a very proper agent for her pre&s;ent purpo&s;es. The young man I mean, who&s;e name was <HI>Pam,</HI> was &s;on to <HI>Namby Pamby,</HI> an eminent <HI>quack,</HI> who had practi&s;ed in the
<PB N="22" REF="48">
neighbourhood, with great &s;ucce&s;s, and had ac|quired thereby a mighty reputation for cures in de&s;perate ca&s;es. Certain it is, that he was a very impudent, pre&s;umptuous and pompous fel|low, and u&s;ed to harangue the multitude with great effect, &s;o that they would &s;tand with their mouths open, and &s;wallow down for go&s;pel all his hubble bubble jargon&mdash;If, &s;ays he, there are any di&s;tempers raging in <HI>America,</HI> I will cure them <Q REND="inline">"by ordering &s;ome large do&s;es of my pills to be &s;ent over to <HI>Germany.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;This &s;ort of rodomantade nobody under&s;tood, and to be &s;ure nobody could under&s;tand&mdash;and yet it was &s;wal|lowed down with wonderful avidity by the po|pulace, who admired the bold a&s;&s;everations of the man, and even gave him credit for his unpar|ralelled effrontery. Such was the fire of a mo&s;t promi&s;ing &s;on, who if he had been bred to his father's profe&s;&s;ion, would have out-&s;tripped any empiric of any age or country&mdash;never was youth &s;o well calculated by nature for this important &s;cience. Nobody was better qualified for the happy practice of every trick and deceit re|qui&s;ite for &s;ucceeding in this ingenious profe&s;|&s;ion. No body could have di&s;tributed the pill or no&s;trum, with a better grace, or more &s;elf|&s;ufficiency. Nobody could have better amu&s;ed the multitude, with founding &s;entences equally
<PB N="23" REF="49">
devoid of &s;en&s;e or argument. But there is a peculiarity of fate attends every man; &s;o that in&s;tead of being brought up to the external &s;tage, it &s;o fell out that young <HI>Pam,</HI> for &s;o his name was familiarly contracted, was bound apprentice to a grocer.&mdash;But this crafty youth a&s;piring to greater things, and feeling in him|&s;elf the &s;eeds of a towering treachery and chi|cane, &s;oon broke his apprentice&s;hip, and <HI>John Bull,</HI> for his father's &s;ake (for he had cured him of a bad rupture) gave the lad a very &s;nug birth in his <HI>compting-hou&s;e,</HI> where he was put under the immediate and in&s;tructive tuition of one <HI>Harry Mac-Bumbo,</HI> and he, together with his preceptor, had been aiding and abetting in framing the late infamous compromi&s;e, re|&s;pecting the long litigated affair of the <HI>we&s;t country</HI> tenantry.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Pam,</HI> of whom we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more at large hereafter, was a youth of pregnant parts, and as I have before ob|&s;erved, had excellent talents for haranguing the multitude. Though I am apt to think they were much over-rated, and that his own view of them was through a large magnifying medium. Add to this, he enjoyed a very hand|&s;ome portion of &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s, great arro|gance, great ob&s;tinacy, great pompo&s;ity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="24" REF="50">
together with great craft, cunning duplicity, and meanne&s;s of mind&mdash;To the&s;e were joined a prepo&s;terous ambition, not for power, but for the mere &s;hadow and &s;emblance of it. To gratify this &s;trange equivocal pa&s;&s;ion, he would have &s;acrificed every con&s;ideration human or divine.&mdash;To enjoy this phantom, there was no degree of meanne&s;s he would not &s;ubmit to. Nor did he feel &s;ore at the nece&s;&s;ity of flat|tering, fawning and crouching, to tho&s;e who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the real object of his de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Such was the per&s;on fixed upon by the <HI>nur&s;e,</HI> for the management of her propo&s;ed enterprize, when time &s;hould have properly matured mat|ters for action, for which &s;he waited with a fever of impatience. Nor was the youth and inexperience of <HI>Pam,</HI> any &s;erious objection in her eyes: for what &s;he required was implicit obedience, without either reflection or know|ledge.</P>
<P>She al&s;o communicated her &s;ecret intentions to &s;ome other cho&s;en a&s;&s;ociates, among whom was one <HI>Surly,</HI> a leading con&s;pirator, to whom it is &s;aid, <HI>Pam,</HI> owed his pre&s;ent promotion, having been recommended by him, as the mo&s;t proper tool for &s;uch a tran&s;action.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="51">
<HI>Surly,</HI> was by nature formed for a con&s;pirator, of a &s;tern and capricious turn of mind, he was as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> phra&s;es it, fit for trea&s;on, &s;tra|tagem and &s;poil, and took upon him&s;elf the great direction of this di&s;graceful bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Things were now beginning to ripen, and the <HI>nur&s;e</HI> and <HI>Surly,</HI> had &s;ettled their plan. The <HI>nur&s;e</HI> therefore &s;ent for <HI>Pam,</HI> informing him of what great things &s;he would do for him, if he would undertake this bu&s;ine&s;s. The boy's head was perfectly turned with this unexpected piece of good fortune, by which he &s;aw plainly that he &s;hould have the appearance of enjoying great power and pre-eminence in the family&mdash;accord|ingly he did not require a moment to con&s;ider of what was prudent and proper for him to do, or what he really was able for&mdash;all that was perfectly out of the que&s;tion, and his u&s;ual pre&s;umption determined him at once to em|brace this tempting offer of the <HI>nur&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>She finding &s;he had hit upon the fitte&s;t tool in the world for her purpo&s;e, advi&s;ed him to go without lo&s;s of time to Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s apartment, and call upon her to exert her&s;elf in concerting and carrying through a compleat reform and regulation of tho&s;e clerks, who had taken upon
<PB N="26" REF="52">
them&s;elves the tran&s;actions of the <HI>Ea&s;t country</HI> trade.</P>
<P><HI>Pam,</HI> went accordingly, and executed his com|mi&s;&s;ion with a good grace. He told Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> that &s;uch a licentious conduct in a &s;et of clerks, ill became that character for humanity, and that reputation for regularity which Mr <HI>Bull</HI> had acquired in the trading world; that it was a great di&s;grace upon him, and upon the whole family, and that for his part he wi&s;hed of all things to &s;ee a proper reform &s;et on foot. Not a trivial enquiry, a palliative or half mea&s;ure, but a &s;trong, manly and decided determination, to &s;tem that torrent of villainy and abu&s;e of power, which were become &s;hameful, not only in the eyes of Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> and his family, but al&s;o in tho&s;e of all the neighbours.</P>
<P><HI>Renard,</HI> happened to be in Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s cham|ber, when <HI>Pam</HI> held this di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;aid candidly, openly and ingeniou&s;ly, that he was truly a&s;hamed he had never yet &s;tirred in a bu|&s;ine&s;s, which he felt &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the reputation and pro&s;perity of Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> and the hou&s;e, and as one of his confidential &s;ecre|taries, he reckoned it his duty to prepare and lay a plan before Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> for her opinion and approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="53">
Accordingly comes Mr. <HI>Renard,</HI> in a few days with his plan, and a very &s;en&s;ible and well di|ge&s;ted one it was, and extremely well calculated for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Pam</HI> was pre&s;ent when <HI>Renard</HI> read it over to Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> and was chuckling and perfectly hap|py to think he had now got <HI>Renard</HI> to propo&s;e an affair, which he was fully convinced would ruin him for ever. Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> he knew had a little penchant towards the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and he was in the highe&s;t hopes, that &s;he would reject the plan propo&s;ed by <HI>Renard,</HI> which plan he thought would throw him into perfect di&s;grace, with <HI>John Bull,</HI> his family, and counting-hou&s;e&mdash;Be&s;ides <HI>Pam</HI> well knew, that many of Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s &s;ervants were clearly in the intere&s;t of the <HI>ea&s;t country</HI> clerks, from motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t and from douceurs, which they had either touched, or were in hopes of touch|ing. Nay, it was even &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected in the family, that the <HI>nur&s;e</HI> her&s;elf, and &s;ome of her neare&s;t connections, had at times felt &s;ome|thing of an itching palm, and that &s;he had no greater aver&s;ion than her neigbours to the lu&s;tre of oriental gew-gaws; of which little frailties, female minds are wonderfully &s;u&s;ceptible. How far this may have been the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, I
<PB N="28" REF="54">
will not take upon me to determine, but if it was &s;o, it mu&s;t be allowed, that upon this, as well as on other occa&s;ions, &s;he perfectly under|&s;tood how to di&s;&s;emble, for &s;he not only agreed to the nece&s;&s;ity of a reform, but even approved of the propo&s;ed plan as effectual.</P>
<P><HI>Pam</HI> was however egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken with re&s;pect to Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> who &s;aw with her u&s;ual good &s;en&s;e, that trifling regulations would not do the bu&s;ine&s;s, and that it required &s;uch vi|gorous mea&s;ures as <HI>Pam</HI> him&s;elf had propo&s;ed and <HI>Renard</HI> had planned.</P>
<P>Never was poor wretch &s;o humbled and &s;o cre&s;t fallen as was Mr. <HI>Pam,</HI> when he heard Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject. He left the apartment quite in de&s;pair, having no con|&s;olation remaining, but in the &s;upport and ob|&s;tinacy of the <HI>nur&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Ju&s;t as he was going through the lobby, with a heavy heart; for|tunately for him, he met with one <HI>Trim Stutter,</HI> a near relation of his own, to whom he briefly related what had pa&s;&s;ed. <HI>Trim,</HI> who was a man of intrigue, bid <HI>Pam</HI> be of good cheer, for &s;o long as he had the patronage and pro|tection of the <HI>nur&s;e,</HI> he &s;aid he had nothing to fear.

<P><HI>TRIM</HI> was as good as his word.&mdash;As &s;oon as it was dark, away he goes to the back door, which leads to a pair of back &s;tairs, that go up to the <HI>nur&s;e</HI>'s apartment, groping his way as well as he could; at la&s;t, with the help of a dark lanthorn, he finds out the place, and be|ing very thin and lank, he &s;queezes him&s;elf up the narrow winders, with great &s;tillne&s;s and alacrity.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS ended this very extraordinary con|ver&s;ation to the mutual &s;atisfaction of both parties, <HI>Trim</HI> took leave, in order to go and deliver his me&s;&s;ages to Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s &s;ervants, and at the &s;ame time gave them to under&s;tand, what they were to expect for the &s;ervice required of them. Some of them, however, fought &s;hy upon the &s;ubject, and &s;aid, they had promi&s;ed <HI>Renard</HI> to take particular care of his papers&mdash;Others who were &s;incerely attached to <HI>Boreas</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="70">
and <HI>Renard,</HI> &s;aid, no harm &s;hould come to the papers, if they could po&s;&s;ibly prevent it. But far the greate&s;t part of them being naturally of the mo&s;t <HI>accommodating</HI> turn of <HI>mind,</HI> took <HI>Trim</HI> a&s;ide, and told him not to give him&s;elf any further trouble, for tho' they had promi&s;ed <HI>Renard</HI> to take care of his plan, yet they had &s;uch re&s;pect for the <HI>nur&s;e</HI>'s opinion in all the&s;e matters&mdash;that he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, the plan &s;hould never more be &s;een in that apartment.</P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> was now perfectly overjoyed. He re|turned the following night&mdash;by the &s;ame dark path, to the nur&s;e's apartment, carrying along with him his cou&s;in <HI>Pam,</HI> who was now made &s;teward, in the room of Mr. <HI>Whigman;</HI> and <HI>Trim Stutter,</HI> for his good &s;ervices, was made one of <HI>John</HI>'s &s;ecretaries, along with one <HI>Tim Simper,</HI> a poor cuckoldy kind of a fellow, who knew nothing whatever of bu&s;ine&s;s, but was placed there very mal-a-propos to <HI>fill a gap.</HI></P>
<P>It might now be very properly &s;aid, that the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> was as happy as a <HI>king.</HI> She therefore no longer kept any terms with <HI>Whigman,</HI> or <HI>Boreas,</HI> or <HI>Renard,</HI> but was determined to &s;end them all a-packing together.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="71">
Being however a&s;hamed of this dirty and de|ceitful bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he would not face the principal, but &s;ent a me&s;&s;age by <HI>Trim,</HI> de&s;iring to have the keys of the <HI>hou&s;e, compting hou&s;e, cellars, pan|try,</HI> and larder, &amp;c. delivered up to her, which was immediately complied with by the parties.</P>
<P>Upon hearing of this extraordinary proceed|ing, <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard,</HI> went immediately to Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> to enquire the cau&s;e of it. She declared &s;he knew nothing of the matter, and was as much &s;urpri&s;ed as they them&s;elves had been: <HI>Renard</HI> complained to her loudly of this &s;ort of treatment, and &s;aid, It was &s;ingular that people going about their bu&s;ine&s;s with all the attention imaginable, and doing every piece of drudgery, &s;hould be undermined by <HI>&s;ecret influence,</HI> and <HI>back-&s;tair vi&s;its,</HI> and turned out of doors without a month's warning, or a month's wages, and all this without any rea|&s;on a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P><HI>Pam</HI> now came by order of the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> to pay his re&s;pects to Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> and to inform her of his promotion. He was prodigiou&s;ly elevated on the occa&s;ion, and was become very high and migh|ty, and extremely pompous.&mdash;He told Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> that the rea&s;on of the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>John</HI>'s late &s;ervants, was their attempt to carry thro'

he brought his plan to Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> and having read it to her, both <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard</HI> di&s;ap|proved &s;o much of it, that Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> ordered it to be thrown into the fire.&mdash;This however did not di&s;may our &s;tripling&mdash;who was now in the &s;ecret, and knew he had only to brazen it out, till Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> was di&s;patched&mdash;Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> her&s;elf, knowing the <HI>Nur&s;e's</HI> character, and her extreme vindictive di&s;po&s;ition, felt &s;ome fore|bodings of her fate, and u&s;ed to communicate her &s;u&s;picions to <HI>Renard,</HI> and <HI>Boreas,</HI> and her other friends.&mdash;Nay &s;he even charged <HI>Pam</HI> to his face, with having &s;ome evil intentions to|wards her.&mdash;But, like ma&s;ter, like man, they &s;ay, for <HI>Pam</HI> was now become a compleat ma&s;ter of di&s;&s;imulation, and &s;wore him&s;elf black in the face, that there was not the lea&s;t intention to touch a hair of her head.</P>
<P><HI>Trim,</HI> however in&s;i&s;ted, both with the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> and with <HI>Pam,</HI> that now or never was the time for di&s;patching the good old lady, who he in&s;i&s;ted would thwart them in all their views, and he declared his fingers were itching for her blood. But <HI>Pam,</HI> who was young and not yet innured to murder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, begged of them to &s;pare her life, and having a very high opinion of his own eloquence, he &s;aid, he would try what that could do, to bring her over to his

He had been heretofore in the &s;ervice of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s own &s;i&s;ter <HI>Peg,</HI> where he had had the run of her kitchen; but finding that fare va&s;tly too &s;canty for his eager appetite, and &s;eeing nothing but &s;tarvation &s;taring him in the face, he was determined to &s;hift his ground, and look out for &s;omewhat more lucrative. He ha&s;tened therefore to a &s;cene of action, much more &s;uit|able to his talents, and entered into the &s;ervice of <HI>John Bull,</HI> and was, by means of his wife, placed under the direction of <HI>Boreas,</HI> during his &s;teward&s;hip. <HI>Mac-Bumbo,</HI> who was a &s;ly bu&s;tling fellow, &s;oon recommended him&s;elf to <HI>Boreas,</HI> by a&s;&s;iduity, activity and zeal, and was
<PB N="50" REF="76">
by him liberally rewarded for his trouble, in&s;o|much, that <HI>Harry</HI> vowed attachment to his be|nefactor for life, an oath he always readily made on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>When <HI>Malagrida</HI> &s;uceeded to the &s;teward&s;hip, he paid his court very &s;ucce&s;sfully to him, who finding him u&s;eful and ready at all &s;orts of work, and that if well paid, he would turn his hand to any thing, be it ever &s;o dirty, he con|tinued him in the counting-hou&s;e, and gave him a very &s;nug birth. For which, as before, he &s;wore an attachment for life, to <HI>Malagrida.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Malagrida</HI> was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> for his abominable compromi&s;e, as we have before related, <HI>Mac-Bumbo</HI> did not think he was likely to be taken much notice of in fu|ture, either by <HI>Boreas</HI> or <HI>Renard,</HI> &s;eeing that they knew him, and knew exactly by what &s;teerage he &s;haped his cour&s;e. He therefore pitched upon young <HI>Pam</HI> for his future patron, to whom he once more &s;old him&s;elf for life, &s;oul and body, as thinking <HI>Pam</HI> &s;tood well with the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> and tru&s;ting that this was far the &s;ure&s;t and neare&s;t road, to pre&s;ent pay and good quarters. <HI>Mac-Bumbo</HI> was a rare talkative fellow in his northern jargon, and di&s;cour&s;ed with great apparent manline&s;s, openne&s;s, and
<PB N="51" REF="77">
boldne&s;s, which was altogether to be attributed to manner, for at bottom, he was fal&s;e and hol|low. He certainly had con&s;iderable talents, but they were accompanied with grat ra&s;hne&s;s, im|prudence and precipitation. He was prodigal in his expences, and di&s;&s;olute in his way of life, &s;o that he was always in debt, and in difficul|ties&mdash;but as he could not live without his plea|&s;ures, he was glad to procure them at any price. Money therefore he mu&s;t have, and it was his e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, <Q REND="inline">"No pay no &s;wi&s;s."</Q> It was no wonder then, if <HI>Mac-Bumbo,</HI> always devoted him&s;elf to the be&s;t bidder. <HI>Pam,</HI> tho' yet <HI>unback|nied in the ways of men,</HI> plainly perceived that <HI>Mac-Bumbo</HI> was likely to be damned u&s;eful, where much dirty work was to be done.</P>
<P>Nor was <HI>Pam</HI> le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in his choice of a &s;econd agent. A man, whom hi&s;tory, &s;en&s;i|ble of her own dignity, &s;toops with incredible reluctance to de&s;cribe. The meanne&s;s of his mind could only be equalled by the lowne&s;s of his birth. His progenitor was a melter of tal|low. He was reared in the &s;ervice of a <HI>famous &s;hip-builder,</HI> and never in any tran&s;action in his life lo&s;t &s;ight of a job. He was recom|mended to <HI>Boreas</HI> by his former ma&s;ter, but his gratitude to him for that &s;ervice, never &s;at
<PB N="52" REF="78">
heavy on his &s;tomach. He improved his op|portunities under <HI>Boreas,</HI> to great advantage. For he being &s;teward in the time of the law-&s;uit, when great &s;ums were annually expended, there was much money to be borrowed&mdash;great fees to be paid to coun&s;el&mdash;great bills to attor|neys, open table was kept for them, and this occa&s;ioned a va&s;t expence in cooks, &s;cullions, firing, and God knows what all.&mdash;Nothing of this immen&s;e detail e&s;caped the jobbing vigi|lance of <HI>Jack</HI> the <HI>Rat-catcher,</HI> for that was his name and de&s;ignation. He u&s;ed to &s;weat every guinea that pa&s;&s;ed through his hands; and much good bread and butter, chee&s;e and beer, did he make away with. Be&s;ides, it was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;|pected, that he run <HI>&s;nips</HI> with all the butchers, bakers, brewers, brokers, and contractors of the times, till he acquired a fortune, more than <HI>Mini&s;terial.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Renard,</HI> when in office, wanted very much to have enquired into the &s;tate of this man's ill|gotten gains, but <HI>Boreas,</HI> from friend&s;hip, inter|fered and prevented it. As to <HI>Jack</HI> him&s;elf, he ro&s;e up before Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> and her whole com|pany, and &s;wore upon the holy Evangeli&s;ts, that he had only pocketed a very &s;mall &s;um, which he &s;aid he had &s;craped together by great penu|ry
<PB N="53" REF="79">
and attention. And this he did with, what the Iri&s;h call, a very pretty pre&s;ence of mind, at the &s;ame time that almo&s;t every body pre&s;ent, knew he was living in the greate&s;t &s;plendor and profu&s;ion. Whether Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> really gave much credit to his a&s;&s;ertions, I never could learn, but this I know, that few be&s;ides believed him. However, he was ably defended by <HI>Boreas,</HI> for who&s;e veracity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> had the highe&s;t re&s;pect. But <HI>Jack,</HI> like a com|pleat &s;coundrel, lived to turn tail on his Ma|ker, and betray his liberal benefactor. He had however, found means to ingratiate him&s;elf much with the nur&s;e, and had received from her &s;ome marks of her favour.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SUCH were the runners now in the &s;ervice of <HI>Pam,</HI> and he employed them accord|ing
<PB N="54" REF="80">
to their genius and talents. Finding Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> &s;trongly bent again&s;t his appointment to the Steward&s;hip, as con&s;idering him a mere <HI>School-boy,</HI> inexperienced in bu&s;ine&s;s, book-keep|ing, and accounts, and without knowledge of mankind; he was however, determined, if po&s;|&s;ible, to win her over to his &s;ide, and &s;o &s;et <HI>Mac Bumbo</HI> and <HI>Jack,</HI> to work to corrupt all her &s;er|vants, by foul or by fair means. Some they bribed, others they intimidated, and to &s;ome they promi&s;ed little annuities for life, or po&s;ts, or ribbons, or &s;tars, or white wands, and &s;uch like baubles, which were all to be furni&s;hed by the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> who had a neat a&s;&s;ortment of this kind of Gew-gaws. This, to manly minds, may appear a &s;pecies of corruption that could but little avail; but it &s;hould be remembered, that they were not ill adapted to the maid-&s;ervants, and other low cattle, about Mrs <HI>Bull</HI>'s family.</P>
<P>However, all this could not move Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> who continued inflexible in &s;pite of every argu|ment that could be u&s;ed with her &s;ervants, or that her &s;ervants could u&s;e with her.</P>
<P>At la&s;t it came to very &s;evere heart-burnings between her and the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> who complained grievou&s;ly that Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> was of a mo&s;t incroach|ing di&s;po&s;ition, for it has been her province,
<PB N="55" REF="81">
time out of mind, to appoint <HI>John</HI>'s dome&s;ticks, and that now Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> wanted mo&s;t unwarrant|ably to arrogate the whole power to her&s;elf. Be|&s;ides, &s;ays &s;he, what fault can &s;he find with the young man I have appointed, has &s;he any crime to lay to his charge? if &s;he has, let her name it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> prote&s;ted, that &s;he did not wi&s;h to encroach on the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> s pro|vince of appointing the &s;ervants, on the con|trary, it would be to her a very trouble&s;ome and a very invidious ta&s;k; but at the &s;ame time &s;he was obliged to keep the pur&s;e and to lay out <HI>John</HI>'s ca&s;h to the be&s;t advantage, and with the greate&s;t management and oeconomy; &s;he therefore thought it would be very hard indeed, if &s;he had not at lea&s;t a negative voice, and a power of repre&s;enting her opinion about new &s;er|vants, and of &s;aying, &s;uch a per&s;on will never do, I cannot tru&s;t him&mdash;which is, &s;ays &s;he, all I alledge with re&s;pect to <HI>Pam,</HI> who tho' I do not charge with any crime, yet, I mu&s;t, and do in&s;i&s;t upon it, that I cannot put con|fidence in him&mdash;in &s;hort he is too young and inexperienced, he is a mere &s;chool-boy, who can know nothing of men or of affairs.&mdash;Now tho' I cannot tru&s;t to this boy, &s;urely I do not mean to name any body in his place, let the
<PB N="56" REF="82">
<HI>Nur&s;e</HI> choo&s;e whom &s;he plea&s;es, and if I think he is really qualified for the management of <HI>John</HI>'s affairs, I am &s;ure I &s;hall rai&s;e no objec|tion whatever. But where there is many to choo&s;e from, I confe&s;s I &s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;ee a very bad choice made.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tile in which both parties talked of each other, and as it always happens on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the more they talked, the more they became irritated; at length Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> was advi&s;ed by her friends to write a civil letter to the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> to explain her &s;entiments at large. This &s;he did in a very polite manner, but the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> (as her temper dictated) was as ob&s;tinate as a mule, and would not yield a jot. She however, thought it requi&s;ite to give a civil an&s;wer to Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s letter, which &s;he did in the mo&s;t &s;hufling and deceitful language.&mdash;Some mutual friends then interpo&s;ed, and by various meetings at the Old Wre&s;tlers, tried to accommodate matters between the parties, but this al&s;o failed of &s;ucce&s;s, for they could get nothing out of the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> but equivocal propo|&s;itions couched in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure terms.</P>
<P>It was then the good old lady Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> be|gan &s;eriou&s;ly to apprehend danger to her&s;elf, and communicated her ideas thereon to <HI>Boreas</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="83">
and <HI>Renard</HI>&mdash;who both a&s;&s;ured her, &s;he had no|thing to fear at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e both the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> and <HI>Pam,</HI> knew that her life was of the greate&s;t im|portance to her hu&s;band, and to the exi&s;tence of the whole family.&mdash;For &s;he mu&s;t &s;urely know that &s;he had in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;um of money, which could not be touched or di&s;po&s;ed of, without her con&s;ent and approbation, which &s;um, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave <HI>John</HI> from immediate bankruptcy.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;aid they, you have another hold over the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> and <HI>Pam,</HI> which is the arrears due to the coun&s;el and lawyers, and the &s;ettle|ment of their bu&s;ine&s;s, which it is well known they require annually, which with their other pre&s;&s;ing demands, cannot be finally adju&s;ted without your con&s;ent and approbation, and who in ca&s;e of any delay or want of punctuality in their payment and &s;uch like, would bring both the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> and <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf over the coals in the twinkling of an eye&mdash;You may therefore depend upon it, nothing can be attempted again&s;t your life, while you wield the&s;e wea|pons in your own hand.</P>
<P>All this while, <HI>John</HI> who had heard of this miff, and who had not at fir&s;t concerned him&s;elf much about it, thinking it only a fooli&s;h &s;quab|ble
<PB N="58" REF="84">
between two old women, began now to look upon it as a more &s;erious matter than he was aware of, and felt rather unea&s;y about it. To be &s;ure, quoth <HI>John,</HI> Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> is my lawful wife, and as &s;uch is my repre&s;entative in this family, and is entitled to the re&s;pect and atten|tion of the be&s;t of them. But at the &s;ame time, I would not have the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> maltreated, or de|graded neither. She's an old friend, and I mu&s;t not &s;ee her wronged, but I know &s;he's damned ob&s;tinate, when &s;he takes any freak in her head. O as for that, one might as well try to move the great <HI>Germanic</HI> empire.&mdash;But continued he, I don't like this huge familiarity between my wife and <HI>Boreas,</HI> and &s;till wor&s;e, her late go&s;|&s;ipings with this &s;ame &s;quire <HI>Renard.</HI>&mdash;Hang it, I am not naturally jealous neither, but yet there is a wonderful &s;ort of a flirtation goes on in that quarter&mdash;poh, poh, it cannot be, my wife is too old, and too &s;edate to think of the&s;e pranks in her old days.&mdash;But damn it, who knows, &s;he may &s;till have a colt's tooth in her head, I did get &s;uch a hint from one of my be&s;t friends, and one who I am &s;ure wi&s;hes me well.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as <HI>John</HI> was running over a variety of circum&s;tances, pro and con, in his own mind,
<PB N="59" REF="85">
and trying which way the balance inclined, the &s;cale of &s;u&s;picion &s;eeming rather to propon|derate&mdash;His lucubrations were all at once in|terrupted by a flying report that there was a boat gone up to the &s;tairs, at <HI>Bullock's-hatch,</HI> in order to take the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> and all her luggage aboard, that &s;he might go home to her own native country&mdash;<HI>John's</HI> unea&s;ine&s;s and appre|hen&s;ions, were rather increa&s;ed upon this, how|ever he plucked up a &s;pirit, and ob&s;erved, That if &s;he was tired of him and his family, &s;he might go, he would keep the boy <HI>George,</HI> who he was very &s;ure, would be glad to &s;tay with him. This being faithfully reported to the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> nettled the old woman not a little&mdash;And tho' &s;he laid a&s;ide all thoughts of carrying the boat trick any farther, le&s;t it &s;hould be carried too far&mdash;yet there were other &s;tratagems in &s;tore, and more artillery to be played off.</P>

<P>THE next trick to be tried, was to have a gang of lying, prating thieves, who were to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in the coffee-hou&s;es, taverns and ale-hou&s;es, and wherever <HI>John</HI> was to be &s;een, and there to drum it eternally in his ears, as how <HI>Renard</HI> had been &s;een with Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> at all hours of the night, and as how he had been over-heard propo&s;ing to her to break open the &s;trong room, and make off with <HI>John's</HI> title-deeds, and as how &s;he being too great with <HI>Renard,</HI> did not &s;eem to object&mdash;and al&s;o as how they had &s;ometimes with them, a long robe-man, who encouraged them in this plan, by telling them, <HI>That title-deeds, and even Mag|na Farta it&s;el&s;, were nothing to &s;ignify, for that they were only pieces of parchment with &s;eals dangling to the ends of them.</HI>&mdash;All this curious fabrication of fal&s;hood, mi&s;repre&s;entation and

mi&s;chief, was put under the direction of one <HI>Jemmy Mac O&s;&s;ian,</HI> a very cunning crafty loon as ever &s;i&s;ter <HI>Peg</HI> bred in her garret.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A true narrative of <HI>Mrs Bull</HI>'s tragical exit, with the unhappy fate of her favourite &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;Some remarks on her daughter, and a &s;ketch of her will.&mdash;A curious account of the Coroner, his in|que&s;t and verdict.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JOHN BULL,</HI> was not in that humour at pre&s;ent to be much grieved at the death of his wife, who as we have above related, he began to harbour a very &s;o &s;o opinion of. He therefore gave him&s;elf but little trouble to find out the cau&s;e of her &s;udden departure, and of her &s;i&s;ter's misfortune, a cata&s;trophe which did not &s;eem to affect him more than it does the common run of fa&s;hionable hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>This however, is an event, of which we, as an authentic hi&s;torian of the <HI>res ge&s;tae</HI> of tho&s;e times, cannot omit giving a mo&s;t circum&s;tan|tial account, as faithfully and as correctly as it

been wanted to us on the great tide of contem|porary writers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nur&s;e, Trim,</HI> and <HI>Pam,</HI> were now con|vinced from experience, that Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> was far too hone&s;t, too di&s;intere&s;ted, and too faithful to her hu&s;band, to allow her&s;elf to be detached from, what &s;he thought, his real good. They therefore determined, without further delibera|tion, to bring her to an untimely end. But fir&s;t it was found ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to get her to &s;ettle the two points above mentioned.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e they cho&s;e to di&s;&s;emble their ha|tred, and even went &s;o far as to cajole the good woman, a piece of deceit and duplicity which co&s;t none of them very dear.&mdash;A young friend of <HI>Pam</HI>'s, of whom Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> was known to have a good opinion, was now charged with a me&s;&s;age to her, when a&s;&s;urances pa&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI>'s great regard for her, and how far it was from her thoughts to have any bad intentions towards her, with a thou&s;and &s;uch friendly ex|pre&s;&s;ions.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is very difficult to &s;ay what pa&s;&s;es in any body's mind on mo&s;t occa&s;ions. But as Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> was a very &s;en&s;ible woman, with an un|common &s;hare of penetration, we think it more than probable, that &s;he was not altogether

blinded by tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions.&mdash;However, they certainly made a great impre&s;&s;ion, but what, with, her made a much greater, was the very nice and critical &s;tate of <HI>John</HI>'s credit, which mu&s;t have &s;uffered an irrecoverable &s;hock, if Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> had not given her con&s;ent to the pay|ment of tho&s;e &s;ums of money, which now lay at her di&s;po&s;al. And further, &s;he dreaded extremely the con&s;equences of not &s;atisfying the coun&s;el, and other law folks, lately employed in her long vexatious &s;uit, for &s;he well knew that this &s;ort of people could not be put off, but upon the lea&s;t demur, might bring an action of tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t <HI>John.</HI> The&s;e con&s;iderations, with the a&s;&s;urances given by <HI>Pam,</HI> and his friends, made her at length come to the fatal re&s;olution of parting with her own &s;ecurity; and no &s;ooner was that done, but mea&s;ures were in&s;tantly con|certed between the <HI>Nur&s;e, Trim,</HI> and <HI>Pam,</HI> how and at what time the horrible deed &s;hould be perpetrated. All this being fixed, the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> &s;ent word that &s;he was coming to wait upon Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> about bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence. She went accordingly, dre&s;&s;ed out in great parade, and having talked over the bu&s;ine&s;s in the u&s;ual way&mdash;the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> before &s;he retired, whi&s;pered to <HI>Surly,</HI> who was near her, upon which he &s;tep|ping forward and pulling forth a mortal in&s;tru|ment,
<PB N="67" REF="93">
at one blow put a period to the exi&s;tence of the be&s;t of wives.&mdash;The bloody &s;cene did not end here, for there was in the room at the time a younger and favourite &s;i&s;ter of Mrs <HI>Bull</HI>'s&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Darling Priviledge,</HI> who &s;eeing the fatal blow aimed, run to embrace and protect her &s;i&s;ter. To her the murderers imagined <HI>John</HI> was extremely attached, and that &s;he would do every thing in her power to prompt him to view this execrable tran&s;action in its true colours, and to puni&s;h it with &s;everity. For this rea&s;on it was, that the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> determined to get rid of her al&s;o. Be&s;ides &s;he knew that this young la|dy had been very in&s;trumental in in&s;tigating Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> to re&s;i&s;t her wi&s;hes. She therefore, im|pre&s;&s;ed with the deepe&s;t re&s;entment, and hoping at once to lay the&s;e formidable foes pro&s;trate at her feet, drew from her brea&s;t, a Stiletto, with which, ru&s;hing eagerly upon the mild and bloom|ing maid, &s;he plunged the dreadful weapon in|to her lovely bo&s;om. She fell upon the body of her expiring &s;i&s;ter, where &s;wooning away, &s;he was thought to be dead by every per&s;on pre|&s;ent&mdash;and &s;uch a report was univer&s;ally propa|gated; however &s;he was afterwards found with &s;ome &s;igns of life, and being privately conveyed to the country, her friends began to entertain hopes that her weakne&s;s was occa&s;ioned only by
<PB N="68" REF="94">
lo&s;s of blood, and that with &s;kill and care, &s;he might yet be recovered from the dreadful ef|fects of that &s;tunning blow which &s;he had received.</P>
<P>Thus fell the unfortunate Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> one of the be&s;t of women, who had be&s;towed true pains to retrieve her hu&s;band's embarra&s;&s;ed af|fairs, and to re&s;tore them to their u&s;ual flour|i&s;hing condition, to which, there is no doubt but &s;he would have greatly contributed, had &s;he not thus fallen a Martyr to the vindictive di&s;|po&s;ition and ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Nur&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> left behind her, one daughter, named <HI>Reformia;</HI> who, tho' not a beauty, was what may properly be called a bouncing girl; &s;he had &s;everal admirers, of whom we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> bequeathed to this young lady, all the &s;avings &s;he had made, in the regulating and &s;ettling of <HI>John</HI>'s affairs. This patrimony was very differently &s;poken of, &s;ome calling it a very ample fortune, and others, perhaps with more ju&s;tice, alledging that it was a very incon|&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> together with her ble&s;&s;ing, be|queathed to <HI>John,</HI> a ca&s;e of choice cordials,
<PB N="69" REF="95">
which &s;he alledged he would have great occa|&s;ion for, when &s;he was no more. What the particular virtues of the&s;e cordials were, we have never been able to learn.</P>
<P>The coroner's inque&s;t was now come to &s;it on the body of the defunct. The coroner him|&s;elf was a per&s;on of notorious infamy, and therefore extremely fit for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.&mdash;His name was <HI>Lungs,</HI> he was a <HI>Mountebank,</HI> and in his travels thro' foreign countries, he had acquired all the effrontery, and all the gri|mace and je&s;ticulation of that plea&s;ant pro|fe&s;&s;ion&mdash;From profe&s;&s;ional habit, he was ex|tremely addicted to &s;peechifying on all occa|&s;ions&mdash;and as his contortions and writhings, were ridiculous in the extreme&mdash;nobody, who &s;aw him could refrain from laughter. But the deri&s;ion and the contempt of the croud, made no impre&s;&s;ion upon his brazen countenance, or callous mind, which was dipt in gaul, and &s;teept in depravity to the very brim. There was no &s;pecies of vice he was not capable of, &s;o he could but guard him&s;elf again&s;t the anni|madver&s;ion of the law. If a murderer was wanted, <HI>Lungs</HI> was the man to perpetrate &s;uch a crime, in the mo&s;t hidden manner, and with the mo&s;t &s;ubtile poi&s;ons. Was a perjured evidence, required, to bol&s;ter up a bad cau&s;e,
<PB N="70" REF="96">
<HI>Lungs</HI> was the man, who for money, would go compleatly through with it, and &s;top at no|nothing. In &s;hort, his mind was formed for every thing ba&s;e and mean, and for every thing dete&s;table. This wretch, had already received his cue from <HI>Pam,</HI> to whom he was &s;ome how allied&mdash;and having packed his inque&s;t, and called for evidence, properly in&s;tructed, they brought in their verdict, re&s;pecting Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> felo de &s;e; and taking it for granted her &s;i&s;ter-al&s;o was dead, they thought it proper to bring that in lunacy.&mdash;Improbable as the&s;e facts might ap|pear to every judicious per&s;on, yet certain it is that <HI>John Bull</HI> either did give faith to them, or &s;eemed &s;o to do.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have already ob&s;erved, that the impatience which had &s;eized the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> to get rid of &s;er|vants, who, were not altogether of her own choo&s;ing, but who had been &s;trongly recom|mended
<PB N="71" REF="97">
by the late Mrs <HI>Bull</HI>&mdash;and al&s;o that ex|treme di&s;gu&s;t and rage, which &s;he had felt, at the re&s;i&s;tence made by Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> to her ap|pointment of <HI>Pam,</HI> had &s;o preyed upon her con&s;titution, that &s;he was for &s;ometime labour|ing under the dreadful effects of a lingering and bileous fever.&mdash;This increa&s;ing with the irritation of fre&s;h events, had rendered her ex|tremely co&s;tive and bound in the belly. Nor could &s;he ever be prevailed upon during the &s;ervitude of Mr <HI>Whigman,</HI> or his friends, to take proper medicines for her complaints.</P>
<P>The late &s;udden changes, which &s;he had &s;o artfully contrived, and &s;o outrageou&s;ly accom|pli&s;hed, had occa&s;ioned a revul&s;ion in her whole frame, and <HI>Pam</HI> &s;eeing this, encouraged the change of habit, by a gly&s;ter made up after a quack receipt, of his father's.&mdash;This coming powerfully in aid of the natural revul&s;ion above|mentioned, failed not to procure her mo&s;t copious and fetid evacuations, which her phy&s;i|cian very &s;agaciou&s;ly foretold, mu&s;t do her a great deal of &s;ervice. Indeed &s;uch was the un|common abundance of putrid and corrupted matter that flowed from this noxious &s;ource, that her apartment &s;tunk mo&s;t infamou&s;ly in the no|&s;es of every one, who had any &s;en&s;e of &s;melling.
<PB N="72" REF="98">
And to that degree was the &s;tench of corrupted, corruptible and contagious faeces, over the whole hou&s;e, that it was almo&s;t in&s;ufferable in Mrs <HI>Bull</HI>'s apartments, as well as in the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI>'s, and ab&s;olutely pe&s;tilential, from top to bottom of the back &s;tairs. <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf could not but be &s;en&s;ible of it, but at this time, the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> and the young quack, <HI>Pam,</HI> &s;tood &s;o very high in his good graces, that it pa&s;&s;ed for little more than a &s;trong, and not unplea&s;ant <HI>haut-gout,</HI> with poor <HI>John,</HI> who never was very remarka|ble for having a good no&s;e, or for looking a great way before it, and who on this occa&s;ion did not fore&s;ee the very bad effects and infecti|ous di&s;temper, which &s;uch a nui&s;ance, might one day create in the family.&mdash;But to return to the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> who we left upon her clo&s;e-&s;tool&mdash;The heat of the matter thus evacuated, was &s;o great, and in &s;uch abundance, that it cau&s;ed a wonderful irritation, in the orrifice and circum|jacent parts. So that the phy&s;ician, recom|mended the proper application of almond oil, and other emolients, to &s;often and cool the parts. The&s;e were admini&s;tered with great tenderne&s;s, and admirable addre&s;s, by the wait|ing maid, Mrs <HI>Jenky,</HI> who, tho' a tall awkward figure, &s;tooped to this operation, with a va&s;t deal of grace and deterity.&mdash;But alas! all
<PB N="73" REF="99">
this would not do, the heat and irritation en|crea&s;ing, the parts became extremely tender and delicate, and an inflamation en&s;uing, it was thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that Mrs <HI>Jenky</HI> &s;hould lick with her tongue, the place affected, a ta&s;k which &s;he undertook, and bent her long back to perform, with a &s;upplene&s;s and plya|bility which excited admiration in every be|holder. It was however alledged, that Mrs <HI>Jenky,</HI> tho' long accu&s;tomed to the dirtie&s;t of work, did grudge her labour in conveying away this nau&s;eous commodity, which it is &s;aid was by her handed privately to young <HI>Pam,</HI> who &s;aw it &s;lyly di&s;po&s;ed of, in a na&s;ty &s;ink be|longing to Mrs <HI>Bull</HI>'s upper apartment.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>John goes to pay the Nur&s;e a vi&s;it, and congratu|lates her, upon the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of his late &s;er|vants&mdash;She talks to John about the death of Mrs Bull&mdash;Prai&s;es his pre&s;ent &s;ervants&mdash;Ad|vi&s;es him to think of looking out for another Wife.&mdash;And propo&s;es a match which &s;he thinks would fit him to a hair.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> now thought, that &s;eeing all exte|rior forms re&s;pecting his late Wife, were now fully &s;atisfied, that he might go and wait on the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> in her own apartment. Accord|ingly away &s;teps <HI>John,</HI> and having tapped gently at the door, was bid to walk in.&mdash;<HI>John</HI> made one of his be&s;t bows to the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> and &s;he on her part affected prodigious kindne&s;s and cordiallity to <HI>John,</HI> and truly it was no wonder, for never had mortal &s;o devoted him&s;elf and his intere&s;t &s;o implicitly and compleatly to the will, and inclinations and pa&s;&s;ions of another, as <HI>John Bull</HI> had done on this occa&s;ion, to tho&s;e of his <HI>Nur&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> up and told his <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> as how he was come after his late lo&s;s, to congratulate the
<PB N="75" REF="101">
<HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> upon the change of his late abominable &s;ervants, who&s;e roguery and treachery were &s;o well known, that it made it very unnece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;ay any thing more upon the &s;ubject, but only to return her his be&s;t thanks, for the maternal and tender care, &s;he had taken of his neare&s;t and deare&s;t concerns.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> who had a mo&s;t thorough pace contempt for <HI>Bull,</HI> was however extremely happy at this vi&s;it, becau&s;e it quite &s;ilenced all &s;u&s;picions, and future en|quiries and complaints&mdash;She therefore a&s;&s;ured him that next to doing what &s;he reckoned her duty, nothing gave her half &s;o much plea&s;ure, as to find that he approved of her conduct on this occa&s;ion, which &s;he &s;aid was the only means left in her power, to &s;ave the family, the e&s;tate and title-deeds, which indeed had been in the utmo&s;t jeopardy, from that lawle&s;s vagabond crew, which the late Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> had recommend|ed to him.

<P>The cu&s;tom that prevailed of choo&s;ing &s;ervants for John's Wife.&mdash;Renard puts up for that honour. Is eagerly oppo&s;ed by the Nur&s;e and young Pam, the Ea&s;t country clerks, old Padagra and Pelf, but is as warmly &s;upported by mo&s;t of his old friends, and many new acquired ones&mdash;Si&s;ter Peg and John's fir&s;t cou&s;in, Paddy Shillaily, both &s;trive to &s;erve him, and John him&s;elf feels a &s;incere love and regard for him.&mdash;His character, and that of his rival Pam.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is highly nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint my readers with a circum&s;tance relating to <HI>John</HI>'s family, which perhaps they may never before have heard of, and that is the &s;ingular cu&s;tom of choo&s;ing &s;ervants for Mrs <HI>Bull.</HI> It is no doubt common in mo&s;t private families for the lady to choo&s;e her own &s;ervants. But that was not the ca&s;e in <HI>John</HI>'s where it had been cu&s;tomary from time immemorial, to leave the choice intirely to the family at large.</P>
<P>Among many who put up for the honor of &s;erving Mrs <HI>Bull, Renard</HI> was one of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, and &s;o he went about to &s;olicit
<PB N="89" REF="115">
the vote of every one individual in the hou&s;e. It will no doubt appear extremely &s;ingular to tho&s;e who read this extraordinary hi&s;tory, that not with&s;tanding the ridiculous and extravagant fancy, <HI>John</HI> took of blaming of <HI>Renard,</HI> merely out of complai&s;ance to the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> and young <HI>Pam,</HI> yet he could not help loving him &s;incerely. There was, to &s;ay truth, a great &s;imilarity in their characters, in many re&s;pects. For <HI>Renard,</HI> with the mo&s;t uncommon talents, joined extreme good nature, an openne&s;s, a frankne&s;s, and &s;in|cerity which are extremely engaging.&mdash;He was ambitious it is true, but he was very di&s;in|tere&s;ted and carele&s;s to a fault, about money. Every tran&s;action with him, was above board, and he &s;trove not even to conceal his own fol|lies. He followed the dictates of his pa&s;&s;ions, and pur&s;ued his point, without any di&s;&s;imu|lation or affectation.</P>
<P>On the other hand, his rival, <HI>Pam</HI> was artifi|cial, from top to toe, every action, every je&s;ture were the effects of deliberation and &s;tudy&mdash;His talents were not contemptible, but they were brought into play before they were ripe; and tho&s;e premature parts, partook &s;o much of hardne&s;s and acerbity, that it &s;eemed ex|tremely doubtful, if ever they would mellow, &s;o
<PB N="90" REF="116">
as to become fit for any u&s;eful purpo&s;e&mdash;His great talent, and that indeed, in which he &s;hew|ed a peculiar felicity, was his collecting, and keeping together a gang of the mo&s;t co&s;ummate &s;coundrels, that ever infe&s;ted any private fa|mily&mdash;knowing nothing of mankind, he was tempted to &s;upply that deficiency, by cunning deceit and duplicity, which in the end cut him up by the roots&mdash;He was extremely vain, pre&s;umptuous, and &s;elf-&s;ufficient. The&s;e created the mo&s;t compleat arrogance, in&s;olence, and petulance, &s;o that he &s;pared neither rank, age, abilities nor experience. The&s;e di&s;gu&s;tful pa&s;|&s;ions, naturally predominant in haughty minds, were much increa&s;ed by the great notice, and &s;udden preferment procured him by the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI>&mdash;This he attributed wholly to his own &s;uperio|rity, little thinking that the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> was as cun|ning and deceitful as him&s;elf, and that it was not his abilities that recommended him, but becau&s;e &s;he knew he was young, and was in great hopes he might be implicitly led in all his conduct by her&s;elf, and mother <HI>Jenky</HI>&mdash;This was the true cau&s;e of the preference, and mo&s;t certain it is, that the more mean, the more plyable, the more humble and &s;ub&s;ervient, the more likely he was to become, and to continue a favorite with the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> who valued
<PB N="91" REF="117">
no talents but &s;uch as were u&s;eful to her&s;elf&mdash;who felt no attachments but to tho&s;e who were devoted to her will, and who never had a friend, &s;he would not &s;acrifice or betray, when|ever he &s;hould differ in opinion from her&s;elf&mdash;or pre&s;ume to act contrary to her inclination.</P>
<P><HI>Pam,</HI> however, was really not known to <HI>John,</HI> who had taken him into his &s;ervice, merely by the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI>'s recommendation, who &s;poke of him in the highe&s;t terms, and <HI>John</HI> when que&s;tioned by any of his friends about this ridi|culous choice, and when they alledged to him, that it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;chool-boy to manage his complicated affairs&mdash;u&s;ed to to reply&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It &s;ignifies not a groat, I have a good opinion of the boy, and he has never yet done any harm, nor has he been guilty of any trick that I know of, and am per&s;uaded he'll come to under&s;tand my bu&s;ine&s;s as well as the wi&s;e&s;t of them, give him time&mdash;give him time, &s;ays <HI>John,</HI> he'll do, he'll do&mdash;I warrant him."</Q></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this &s;trange harum, &s;ca|ram conduct of <HI>John</HI>'s&mdash;&s;till he could not for|get his old friend&s;hip for <HI>Renard</HI>&mdash;and there|fore he wi&s;hed to &s;ee him in his Wife's &s;ervice, although he had approved of his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="92" REF="118">
from his own&mdash;accordingly he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him all he could, as did many belonging to &s;i&s;ter <HI>Peg</HI>'s family, and al&s;o to the family of <HI>Paddy Shillaily, John</HI>'s fir&s;t cou&s;in. In &s;hort, they &s;o bu&s;tled, and &s;o laboured, and &s;o canva&s;&s;ed, that they &s;ucceeded again&s;t all the intrigues of the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Pam,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t country-clerks,</HI> and the old <HI>Counts, Padagra,</HI> and <HI>Pelf</HI>&mdash;who had joined in order to oppo&s;e him&mdash;But the mo&s;t curious part of the &s;tory is, that after <HI>Renard</HI> had carried his point&mdash;<HI>Pam,</HI> in order to ingratiate him&s;elf &s;till more with the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> denied the fact and &s;wore manfully, that he was not cho|&s;en&mdash;as did al&s;o <HI>Loyd,</HI> the <HI>Baker,</HI> and &s;everal other perjured vagabonds, who as a cloak to their knavery, pretended great knowledge of old rules and orders&mdash;and others again a&s;&s;umed a mighty tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience&mdash;which is the old &s;tale pretext of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate rogues and hypocrites.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all which <HI>Renard,</HI> won the day, to the great di&s;tre&s;s, and vexation both of the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> and <HI>Pam</HI>&mdash;who&s;e character &s;uffer|ed much by his glaring malicious, and ra&s;cally conduct in this affair. <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf who had been &s;o compleatly blind-folded, began now to open his eyes to this ob&s;tinate and deceitful &s;trip|ling,
<PB N="93" REF="119">
but he had been too much taken in by him, and had gone too far in his fooli&s;h admi|ration to retreat all of a &s;udden, and therefore he found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;till vindicating him from any bad intentions&mdash;but affairs &s;oon occurred, which opened his eyes very compleatly, as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to relate more at large, in the &s;equel of this mo&s;t u&s;eful hi&s;tory, which I verily believe to be the real mother of wi&s;dom.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Pam, and Strumbolo the Coal Merchant, make love to the late <HI>Mrs Bull's</HI> daughter Reformia&mdash;They are very coldly received.&mdash;</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have before related that the late excellent woman, Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> left behind her one daughter, who was, to &s;ay truth, both a comely, and a bouncing wench, as one could &s;et their eyes upon, and being now in the bloom of youth, &s;he failed not to attract a numerous &s;uite of admirers.&mdash;</P>
<P>I will not pretend to &s;ay, that the&s;e no more than other modern lovers, were all pa&s;&s;ionate, and di&s;intere&s;ted adorers&mdash;Far from it, mo&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="120">
of them had heard of the great &s;uppo&s;ed for|tune left by her mother's will&mdash;and be&s;ides they knew that of late years, &s;he was become a mighty favorite with <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf, who had been often heard calling lu&s;tily for her to come and attend him as much as &s;he could.&mdash;</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, it was naturally enough for tho&s;e who were de&s;irous of ingratiating them&s;elves with <HI>John,</HI> to make up to his young favourite, and among&s;t tho&s;e who at pre&s;ent &s;tood forward to recommend them&s;elves mo&s;t to Mr <HI>Bull,</HI> was the famous <HI>Strumbolo,</HI> the coal crimp, a per&s;on fully blacker in his mind, than in his profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He was one of tho&s;e dull indu&s;trious plodding fellows who are eternally employed in inve&s;tigating profoundly the mere|e&s;t trifles, and are never happy but when they are pocking their heads into &s;ome na&s;ty en|quiry about other peoples affairs, and this always under the pretext of preventing <HI>John</HI> from being impo&s;ed upon&mdash;Sometimes he would be going about to &s;ee how all the &s;hirts, &s;heets and &s;tockings of the family were wa&s;hed, and &s;pying with his magnifying gla&s;s, to &s;ee if any &s;tains were left, or if the laundre&s;s adhered &s;trictly to her contract. At another time you might &s;ee <HI>Strumbolo</HI> bu&s;y in getting warrants to arre&s;t &s;ome old and faithful &s;ervants of
<PB N="95" REF="121">
<HI>John</HI>'s who had pa&s;&s;ed their days, and ri&s;ked their lives in his &s;ervice&mdash;The tryal, and pu|ni&s;hment of that &s;ort of men for little petty offences, and oppre&s;&s;ing them by the weight of his authority, was a &s;upreme delight to <HI>Srum|bolo,</HI> who had a mortal antipathy to that valour and intrepidity in others, which he knew he had not in him&s;elf&mdash;Like an old maid who repines to &s;ee the young and the gay, in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e enjoyments &s;he can never ta&s;te, and who&s;e envy and malice exerts it&s;elf to embitter their plea&s;ures.&mdash;At another time you might &s;ee this arch-fiend with a great &s;tick in his hand, knocking down, and otherwi&s;e abu|&s;ing all the poor &s;uperannuated pen&s;ioners who were worn out in the &s;ervice of <HI>John,</HI> and his family, <Q REND="inline">"You damned &s;coundrels, &s;ays <HI>Strum|bolo,</HI> you coming here, and get your bellies filled, and carry home victuals for your families, and all for&s;ooth upon the ridiculous pretext that you have &s;erved the family for &s;ixty or &s;eventy years, and are no longer fit for labour.&mdash;A fine rea&s;on truly, quoth <HI>Strumbolo,</HI> becau&s;e I maintain a man twenty years, I mu&s;t perforce maintain him twenty years more, whether I have any u&s;e for him or no&mdash;I'll allow no &s;uch abu&s;es and impo|&s;itions, go and get your living where you can&mdash;You pretend that at your time of life you are not able to work, why the devil then &s;hould we pay you for what you cannot do?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="122">
Then <HI>Strumbolo</HI> never &s;aw a trade&s;man ap|proach the hou&s;e, but what he would have a &s;queeze at him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You dog, you, &s;ays he, you overcharge your bills, I know you do: I could have the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s done for the one hundredth and fifty &s;ixth part of a penny cheaper than what you have done; you are a very great impo&s;tor, and I'll have you turned out of your employ|ment for ever; you may go and &s;tarve, you and your family&mdash;But I &s;uppo&s;e you have taken care of that, you have already feathered your ne&s;t, I have been informed by two or three of your neighbours, with whom you have quarrel|ed, that you have &s;aved money, &s;o that you mu&s;t certainly be a very &s;ad &s;coundrel indeed."</Q></P>
<P>Now all this time while <HI>Strumbolo,</HI> was thus grinding the face of the poor, he was pocket|ing a very hand&s;ome perqui&s;ite by his coal|trade, which from every mean, minute, and dirty detail, he was hoarding up, and accumu|lating to an amazing &s;um, &s;o that the fellow who had really the mean mind of a coal crimp, was now become as rich, as a lord.&mdash;</P>
<P>Among&s;t others of <HI>Srumbolo</HI>'s good qualities, he was a &s;trange wrangling fellow, and loved di&s;putation and bu&s;tle and bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as it was&mdash;From this love of bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;ometimes
<PB N="97" REF="123">
led <HI>John</HI> into needle&s;s expence, and if any of the family found fault with it, and he &s;aw him|&s;elf in any &s;crape, and that an action was brought again&s;t him, he had art enough to contrive to pack his jury, and to be cho&s;en foreman him&s;elf, by which means it was ea&s;y to &s;ee that no harm could ever befall him.</P>
<P>This re&s;pectable per&s;onage was &s;ome how or other allied to the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> by the wrong &s;ide of the blankets&mdash;and it was by means of this con|nection that he had been let into his profitable perqui&s;ites&mdash;He was him&s;elf very vain of the connection&mdash;But &s;he on the other hand, though &s;he carried fair with him, yet did &s;he hate him mo&s;t cordially.</P>
<P><HI>Strumbolo</HI> was exceedingly de&s;irous of being well with <HI>John,</HI> a thing which was not very likely to be, for his character was one of tho&s;e that <HI>John</HI> mo&s;t dete&s;ted and de&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;But in order to get into his good graces, he now made love to <HI>Reformia,</HI> with all the a&s;&s;iduity, and vigour he was ma&s;ter of. <HI>Strumbolo</HI> was not however of that turn of temper or di&s;po&s;i|tion that could make much impre&s;&s;ion upon a young hand&s;ome girl's heart&mdash;He was natu|rally &s;erious rigid, and au&s;tere, and had nothing

like mirth or good humour about him&mdash;It is true he could be extremely well bred&mdash;but he never exerted his politene&s;s &s;o much as when wanted to do an injury, to deceive, and betray, or when he was afraid of the re&s;entment of the per&s;on he was treating with&mdash;A feeling which he was indeed very &s;u&s;ceptible of, for nobody had greater apprehen&s;ions about his own per&s;on|al &s;afety than <HI>Strumbolo,</HI> who had been compelled on various occa&s;ions, to make very mean and humiliating &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, rather than expo&s;e his per&s;on to a hearty drubbing, which he often had occa&s;ion to dread, but always had <HI>an ala|crity</HI> to &s;hun&mdash;Now whether <HI>Reformia</HI> had di&s;covered this failing of <HI>Strumbolo</HI>'s, I will not pretend to &s;ay&mdash;Certain it is the fair &s;ex are very fond of that virtue, which &s;eems to be the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of a manly character, and as there were public proofs, of the infamous cowardice of <HI>Strumbolo,</HI> all his pro&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of profound admiration, and all his flattery had no effect&mdash;However the dog knew what im|portunity would do, and therefore he conti|nued to lay hold of every occa&s;ion to tell the lady, that &s;he was the mo&s;t perfect beauty in the world, that every body admired her, that he for his part wi&s;hed to &s;ee her in every public place, diffu&s;ing her benign influence univer&s;ally

over all ranks, and conditions of men, that there was grace in all her &s;teps, heaven in her eye, in every ge&s;ture, dignity, and love.</P>
<P><HI>Pam</HI> too, was a rival lover, but even le&s;s &s;erious, and le&s;s &s;incere, perhaps, than the form|er.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;hort account of John Bull's fir&s;t Cou&s;in, Paddy Shiliaily.&mdash;His character.&mdash;His ill treatment by John, in his youth.&mdash;His good &s;en&s;e, and great care of his e&s;tate.&mdash;He takes advantage of John's long litigation, with his We&s;t-country tenantry, to get rid of tho&s;e &s;hackles, John had unju&s;tly impo&s;ed upon him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE I proceed further, in the hi&s;tory of <HI>John Bull,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould here in|form my courteous reader, that <HI>John</HI> had a fir&s;t cou&s;in, by the mother's &s;ide, who&s;e name was <HI>Paddy Shillaily.</HI> He, though &s;omewhat young|er than <HI>John,</HI> was educated at the &s;ame &s;chool with him; and together with very good talents, had &s;omething infinitely droll about him. He was a very faithful friend, and had on all occa|&s;ions, &s;howed him&s;elf much attached to his cou&s;in, even in the wor&s;t of times. <HI>John</HI> who felt him&s;elf &s;tronger than <HI>Paddy,</HI> had gained a va&s;t a&s;cendency over him, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, did not altogether, u&s;e him with that liberality and gene|ro&s;ity, which &s;o &s;trongly marked his character in his dealings with others. Not but that he would
<PB N="102" REF="128">
have defended him from the in&s;ults, or abu&s;e of any other per&s;on, to the la&s;t drop of his blood. But on the other hand, he him&s;elf a&s;|&s;umed the privilege of mal-treating, and great|ly oppre&s;&s;ing <HI>Paddy,</HI> and &s;o buffeted, and cru&s;h|ed him, and knocked him about, that it was the opinion of every body, that he had in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;tunted the poor lad's growth, and had prevented him from applying with &s;pirit, to his book, and to his profe&s;&s;ion, which was &s;omewhat in the nature of <HI>John</HI>'s own line, in the manufacturing branch.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, however, <HI>Paddy</HI> turned out a fine promi&s;ing lad. He was as brave as &s;teel, and would rather have a quar|rel upon his hands, than otherwi&s;e. He was a good &s;cholar, and a very &s;en&s;ible man, but had a queer defect in his opticks, which often pre|vented him from &s;eeing his object very correctly, or in its proper point of view.</P>
<P>The &s;ame inaccuracy was remarkable in his modes of expre&s;&s;ion, and <HI>Paddy</HI>'s elocution was often &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;o perplexed, and blun|dering, that it frequently afforded much mirth and fun to his companions. But it was very nece&s;&s;ary for them, to make it appear, that they were laughing with him, and not at him&mdash;
<PB N="103" REF="129">
otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t take the con&s;equences.&mdash;<HI>Paddy</HI>'s &s;entences, like the oracles of <HI>Delphi,</HI> would generally admit of various interpreta|tions: but it truly might be &s;aid of him, that if his utterance was bad, his meaning was good. He had a &s;pecies of &s;arca&s;tic wit, peculiar to him&s;elf, and his vein of humour, however plea|&s;ant, was &s;eldom without its &s;ting. He was by nature prone to be &s;omewhat rude, boi&s;ter|ous and forward, nor were an over diffidence or ba&s;hfulne&s;s, ever ranked among&s;t the num|ber of his foibles; but when he was &s;ufficiently ju&s;tled and rubbed about in the world, which he certainly required, to take off his ru&s;t, and rough corners, no metal could take a brighter poli&s;h, and one might &s;urely pronounce him to be, a clever, manly and generous fellow, as any you would wi&s;h to &s;ee.</P>
<P><HI>Paddy</HI>'s paternal e&s;tate, which was very con|&s;iderable, lay ju&s;t over again&s;t <HI>Bullock's-hatch,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the river, and <HI>John</HI> and <HI>He,</HI> lived together, in terms of intimacy and good neighbourhood, keeping up a very plea&s;ant and friendly intercour&s;e, excepting when little dif|ferences happened, upon matters of &s;elf inter|e&s;t&mdash;And what relations, friends, or neigh|bours, do not frequently differ upon that &s;ub|ject? <HI>John,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of his own &s;uperior &s;trength,
<PB N="104" REF="130">
and the a&s;cendency he had acquired at &s;chool, always took the upperhand, and would allow of no interference, in his branches of trade. If however <HI>Paddy</HI> was inferior to <HI>John</HI> in point of &s;trength, or trade, or income, he made up for the&s;e difficiences, by a very commendable virtue, which was a &s;trict and rigid oeconomy. When <HI>John</HI> was engaged in any of his ridicul|ous law&s;uits, <HI>Paddy</HI> did not grudge to lend him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could. But he would never run him&s;elf in debt, or mortgage his e&s;tate, as <HI>John</HI> had done, &s;o that he had a great advantage over him, in going to market with ready money; by which means, he got every thing much cheaper, and people would work for him at lower wages, knowing their pay was &s;ure, and no deduction to be made on account of law expences, or intere&s;t of money borrowed, or the like; which was a very common cu&s;tom with <HI>John,</HI> who u&s;ed to &s;queeze his weavers and other manufactures, with &s;toppages in &s;uch a manner, that at the end of the week, they had not two thirds of their wages to receive, which greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them and their families.</P>
<P>The day was now come, when by means of the&s;e cur&s;ed expen&s;ive litigations, <HI>John</HI>'s no&s;e was mo&s;t damnably in the dirt, for <HI>Lewis Baboon, Lord Strut, Nic Frog,</HI> and <HI>Yankey,</HI> were all upon
<PB N="105" REF="131">
him, at the &s;ame time; &s;o that he was really &s;ore be&s;et, and his finances very low.</P>
<P><HI>Paddy</HI> then bethought him&s;elf, that now or never was the time for a great exertion to &s;et him&s;elf free, and to get entirely out of <HI>John</HI>'s clutches.</P>
<P>This he executed in a bold and ma&s;terly man|ner, and told <HI>John</HI> fairly, that he would no lon|ger be bound, and tied down, by rules and regulations of his making, but would make them for him&s;elf in future, and he now claimed many privileges, from which he had hitherto been debarred.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> at pre&s;ent felt him&s;elf fairly down, and therefore made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, by yield|ing many points, which he thought might be u&s;eful to his Relation, without much injuring him&s;elf. The&s;e well judged conce&s;&s;ions, were fir&s;t managed by <HI>Boreas,</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Re|nard,</HI> with the advice and con&s;ent of the late Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> ever watchful for <HI>John</HI>'s intere&s;t; and were the cau&s;e of great cordiallity and mu|tual &s;atisfaction to both parties.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A brief narrative of the &s;tate of &s;i&s;ter Peg's health, and how &s;he &s;tood affected, on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion.&mdash;Mac-Bumbo tampers with her Chap|lain, who conducts him&s;elf with great good &s;en&s;e and dignity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is now full time I &s;hould give &s;ome little account, of the tender &s;tate of health, the occupations and &s;entiments of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s own &s;i&s;ter <HI>Peg,</HI> who for &s;ome years pa&s;t had been &s;ubject, to the mo&s;t grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive fits of a lethargic di&s;po&s;ition, whieh had often rendered her, in a manner &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;tupid, and unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s. This &s;hocking di&s;tem|per, did not however prevent her from attend|ing to her own dome&s;tic concerns, to which &s;he was now become extremely attached.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of law, divinity and literature, which had formerly engro&s;&s;ed all her attention, &s;he had become very &s;eriou&s;ly engaged in the culti|vation of her paternal e&s;tate, in building huts for weavers, in &s;pinning and carding, bucking and bleaching, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="133">
<HI>Peg,</HI> notwith&s;tanding, in her lucid intervals, was rou&s;ed at times, when &s;he heard that <HI>John</HI>'s affairs were in danger, or di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;For &s;he well knew, that at pre&s;ent whatever af|fected him, mu&s;t very e&s;&s;entially affect her&s;elf. She was therefore, much concerned, when &s;he was informed of the untimely death of the late Mrs <HI>Bull,</HI> and the unhappy fate of her &s;i&s;ter <HI>Darling Privilege,</HI> who every body concluded, had peri&s;hed along with her. Many ill-judged, and oppre&s;&s;ive things were al&s;o done by <HI>Pam,</HI> to <HI>Peg</HI>'s weavers, and other manufacturers, which helped, very much to di&s;gu&s;t her. However <HI>Mac-Bumbo,</HI> who, as I have related, was for|merly in <HI>Peg</HI>'s &s;ervice, did every thing in his power to flatter and coax her. And he like|wi&s;e, from time to time, gave her &s;ome little paultry pre&s;ents, which had always a great effect with her; who from habits of poverty, and oeconomy, was now become (if po&s;&s;ible,) more &s;elfi&s;h and intere&s;ted than ever. Though &s;he had certainly le&s;s occa&s;ion than formerly, having by attention and indu&s;try, filled her pockets pretty hand&s;omely. But in this weak|ne&s;s, &s;he was not &s;ingular, &s;ince every body knows, that it is the way of the world, for mankind to become more &s;tingy, and avarici|ous, as they become more opulent.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="134">
Among&s;t others who were in high favour with <HI>Peg,</HI> was her chaplain, a very hone&s;t, pious, and learned per&s;on, in whom <HI>Peg</HI> placed great confidence, and had, very ju&s;tly, great regard and friend&s;hip for him. Indeed &s;he had another rea&s;on for her attachment to him, be|&s;ides tho&s;e I have here mentioned. For it is well known, that <HI>Peg,</HI> was extravagantly fond of preaching, and praying, and &s;inging of p&s;alms, and all manner of &s;piritual &s;ongs, and in the&s;e, her chaplain indulged her completely, giving her from time to time, &s;uch dozes of them, as would have perfectly &s;urfeited any moderate chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>To him therefore, <HI>Mac-Bumbo</HI> paid great court, and wi&s;hed very much to have had him &s;end a letter of congratulation to the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> on her having &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully accompli&s;hed her plan, of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing <HI>John</HI>'s late &s;ervants.&mdash;<HI>Mac-Bumbo,</HI> was perfectly aware, that the chaplain had always been very &s;incerely attached to the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> and her family, and really wi&s;hed her well; he did not therefore doubt, but he could have per&s;uaded him, to have given his &s;anction, by approving of her conduct on this occa&s;ion.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>PAM</HI> was &s;o much plea&s;ed with his im|potent and ineffectual plan for &s;etling the <HI>Ea&s;t country bu&s;ine&s;s</HI>&mdash;That he thought it would do him <HI>equal honor</HI> to carry through <HI>as great,</HI> and <HI>as wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> a mea&s;ure, for adju&s;ting and finally arranging the affairs of <HI>John Bull,</HI> and <HI>Paddy Shillaily.</HI>&mdash;In contemplating this grand and glorious object, <HI>Pam</HI> was &s;truck, all of a heap, with the giddy &s;taggers in his head, which confounded his opticks to that degree, that one would have &s;worn he had been
<PB N="110" REF="136">
compleatly infected by <HI>Paddy.</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, he felt him&s;elf &s;o perplexed, and &s;o blunder-headed, that he was quite at a lo&s;s which end of the bu|&s;ine&s;s he &s;hould begin with; or whether, it might not be better to begin in the middle&mdash;after due deliberation this la&s;t plan plea&s;ed him mo&s;t&mdash;So he was determined, to open the bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Paddy,</HI> by informing him, that if he would be plea&s;ed to accept of all <HI>John</HI>'s weaver's, looms and manufactures what&s;oever, that he was &s;ure, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition in which <HI>John</HI> and his Wife were, he would be an&s;werable, he &s;hould get them per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;ign over to him and his heirs for ever, the whole of tho&s;e advantages, and that without any fee or reward, excepting only that he meant to a&s;k for <HI>John,</HI> by way of reciprocity, the &s;urplus of a fund, which had hitherto proved, and always would prove deficient, until <HI>Paddy</HI> &s;hould to|tally de&s;troy and annihilate <HI>John's</HI> manufactures and commerce, at which time, he ob&s;erved, that from his wonderful penetration and &s;agacity, he could fore&s;ee, that this deficient fund, would prove a productive one. This propo&s;ition was &s;o much beyond what <HI>Paddy</HI> had either wi&s;hed or expected, that his ears began to crow like chanticleer, and he really doubted, whether the young manager was not laying &s;ome &s;nare for
<PB N="111" REF="137">
him, and that he meant to take him in, for at this time every body began to &s;u&s;pect his &s;ince|rity; however, having viewed it on all &s;ides, he could &s;ee no bad con&s;equence from receiving a great deal, for which he was to pay nothing but the &s;urplus of a deficiency, which <HI>Paddy</HI> con|cluded could not be very ruinous to him, as it would not probably take <HI>much of his ready mo|ney</HI> out of his pocket.</P>
<P>He therefore determined to accept, and told <HI>Mr Pam</HI> &s;o. <HI>Pam</HI> who had thus begun in the middle, was now determined to take matters by the right end, and &s;o he goes next to <HI>Mrs Bull,</HI> with whom he &s;till continued to be a won|derful favourite, for &s;he knew he and his run|ners had had a great hand in making the match for her.&mdash;He up and told <HI>Mrs Bull,</HI> in the pre|&s;ence of a large company, what he had done, and of the propo&s;als he had made to <HI>Paddy,</HI> and how ready and obliging he had been in accept|ing, what was &s;o much to his advantage;&mdash;and he did not at all doubt but that <HI>John Bull</HI> would approve of his plan, as it was much better to give his trade, his looms, and every thing to <HI>Paddy,</HI> rather than live in ill humour with &s;o near a Relation. He then told <HI>Mrs Bull,</HI> in his u&s;ual way, and with a mode&s;ty peculiar to him|&s;elf,
<PB N="112" REF="138">
(for he had borrowed a little of what <HI>Pad|dy had to &s;pare</HI>) that his plan was one of the be&s;t that ever had been thought of by any hu|man Creature. <HI>Boreas,</HI> he &s;aid, and <HI>Renard,</HI> and the late <HI>Mrs Bull,</HI> had perfectly botched this bu|&s;ine&s;s, for they had agreed to give away all that he intended to give, but they were to get noth|ing in return; whereas he had &s;ecured a very u&s;eful reciprocity, by engaging <HI>Paddy</HI> to pay <HI>John</HI> the &s;urplus of a deficient fund, which <HI>Pad|dy</HI> had very readily agreed to, knowing that &s;uch a &s;um could not po&s;&s;ibly hurt him, and that in matters of &s;uch magnitude, a &s;um like that, was neither here nor there, nor <HI>any where at all at all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pam</HI> was &s;o enchanted with his own &s;uperior wi&s;dom in tran&s;acting this melancholly piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, that in &s;hort, there was no end to the prai&s;e and panegyric he be&s;towed on him&s;elf, and the reproaches he threw out upon his pre|dece&s;&s;ors.&mdash;And as for <HI>Mrs Bull,</HI> &s;he was &s;o charmed with the &s;ound of his voice, that to her, it was of no con&s;equence whether he &s;poke &s;en&s;e or non&s;en&s;e; or whether <HI>&s;he heard him or no,</HI> &s;he made it a rule always to agree with him: and I verily believe, that if <HI>Pam</HI> had dared to propo&s;e to have incarcerated her hu&s;band, or
<PB N="113" REF="139">
even to have ca&s;trated him, &s;he would readily have a&s;&s;ented, by declaring &s;he had &s;o much confidence in <HI>Pam,</HI> that &s;he was &s;ure that the&s;e or any other thing which he &s;hould propo&s;e, would be for <HI>her own</HI> and her hu&s;band's ad|vantage.</P>
<P><HI>John Bull</HI> having been made acquainted with all this, began now, (as well he might) to be mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed. He had for &s;ome time been opening his eyes towards the conduct and character of <HI>Mr Pam,</HI> and this compleated the bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;He therefore began to growl, and bounce and &s;wear, like the devil.&mdash;The weavers and manufacturers particularly, had rea&s;on to complain, &s;eeing they were to be done for, com|pleatly.&mdash;They therefore waited on <HI>Mr Pam,</HI> and remon&s;trated bitterly.&mdash;<HI>Pam,</HI> with his u&s;ual art and duplicity, gave them all fair words, a&s;|&s;uring them, that he would take the mo&s;t tender care of their intere&s;t. This a&s;&s;urance, however, <HI>Renard,</HI> with that &s;hrewdne&s;s which was na|tural to him, &s;oon di&s;covered to be a mere trick and deception, in order to keep them quiet, till all was irrevocably fixed.&mdash;When this di&s;covery was made, the&s;e poor people, who now perceived they had been compleatly duped
<PB N="114" REF="140">
by this little cunning &s;tripling, began forthwith to &s;olicit <HI>Mrs Bull,</HI> and all their friends in her family&mdash;repre&s;enting in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, their di&s;tre&s;s, and the danger and ruin to which they, their wives, and children, would be expo&s;ed.&mdash;In vain did <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard,</HI> and many other &s;incere friends of <HI>John Bull,</HI> and his family, in|terpo&s;e with his wife, to mitigate the rigour of this ill concerted plan. <HI>Pam</HI> was ob&s;tinate, and of cour&s;e, <HI>Mrs Bull,</HI> who was a mere creature of <HI>Pam</HI>'s, remained inflexible, in &s;pite of every thing that could be &s;aid upon the &s;ubject. In &s;hort, &s;till mindful of his paternal profe&s;&s;ion, (for nature will out,) <HI>Pam</HI> now flattered him&s;elf, he had found a no&s;trum and infallible &s;pecific for curing all heart burnings between <HI>Paddy</HI> and <HI>John.</HI>&mdash;Even Sir <HI>Samuel Hannay's</HI> famous &s;pecific, is not more powerful or more effectual in pre|venting evils, than was <HI>Pam</HI>'s, in his own opi|nion, who was determined to ri&s;k every thing precious on this de&s;perate experiment&mdash;the Con&s;titution, Vitals, Body and Soul it&s;elf, were all to be &s;acrificed to this boyi&s;h rage for pre|&s;cription and quackery.</P>
<P>And here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that when <HI>Pam</HI> was hard driven on any &s;ubject, by the &s;uperior
<PB N="115" REF="141">
abilities of <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>Renard</HI>&mdash;there were two &s;ubjects to which he always had recour&s;e, to rou&s;e the prejudices of <HI>John</HI> and his <HI>Wife,</HI> and un|der which he run for &s;helter, as a &s;mall fri|gate will do, under the guns of a fortre&s;s, when cha&s;ed by a &s;hip of &s;uperior force. The&s;e fa|vourite themes were the <HI>We&s;t Country</HI> litigation, conducted by <HI>Boreas,</HI> and the plan for regulat|ing the <HI>Ea&s;t Country</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, propo&s;ed by <HI>Re|nard</HI>&mdash;On which occa&s;ions there was a regular repetition of the &s;tale &s;tory of encroaching upon the power and patronage of the <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> of an|nihilating the old balance and regulations &s;o long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the family&mdash;of purloining all <HI>John Bull</HI>'s charters, and of confi&s;cating the property of the <HI>poor Ea&s;t Country Clerks,</HI> and all that endle&s;s Gibberi&s;h, which had neither &s;en&s;e nor argument.&mdash;After an exordium of this kind, <HI>Pam</HI> next proceeded to prai&s;e his own a|mazing abilities and incorruptible integrity, and from thence took occa&s;ion to attack with infinite in&s;olence, arrogance, malice and &s;pleen, every per&s;on who &s;hould happen to differ from him&s;elf on any &s;ubject;&mdash;and at the &s;ame time that he turned every thing they &s;aid into per|fect ridicule, and &s;neered at, and reprobated
