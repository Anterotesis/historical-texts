<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the whole Nation are happy in the Things You Do, &s;o they are particularly Attentive to what You Say. The Speeches your Maje&s;ty is pleas'd to make in Parliament, are look'd upon as Words &s;poken to all the Kingdom, and their Influences are accordingly Univer&s;al.</P>
<P>Of all the Expre&s;&s;ions that ever pa&s;s'd from Your Royal Lips, I humbly pre&s;ume, none ever &s;ounded in the Ears of Your Prote&s;tant Subjects with &s;o General Applau&s;e, as Your Royal Invitation to <HI>Peace and Union among them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty has, by this one Step, let all the World know, that You not only Seek, but <HI>perfectly under&s;tand,</HI> the General Good of your People, and the Only way to make them Invincible.</P>
<P>It remains to your Subjects, to Accept your Royal Pro|po&s;al, and look upon it as the mo&s;t binding Obligation, &s;ince when Princes &s;toop to Invite their People to what was be|fore their Duty, it carries with it the double Force of a Command.</P>
<P>Your Subjects, Madam, who wi&s;h for Peace, are Encou|rag'd to &s;eek and pur&s;ue it, while they are now &s;atisfied, that &s;o long as they follow the Natural Dictates of their own Rea&s;on, they al&s;o Concur with the Judgment, and obey the obliging Commands of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e unhappy People, who either from the Severity of their Principles; or really <HI>for want of Principles,</HI> are <HI REND="blackletterType">Otherwise Cnclin'd,</HI> that are for Suppre&s;&s;ing their Pro|te&s;tant Brethren for Opinions in Religion, or for Oppre&s;&s;ing their Neighbours for Intere&s;t and Parties, may now be &s;a|tisfied,
<PB REF="5">
that while they pur&s;ue that Unchri&s;tian and Im|politick Method, they not only weaken, but di&s;oblige your Maje&s;ty, and Your real Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And by this your Maje&s;ty will plainly &s;ee who are Your be&s;t Subjects, tho&s;e who willingly embrace the Peace, and General Charity of Chri&s;tians and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Men, according to your Maje&s;ties obliging Exhortation, or they, who, by keeping up the Differences of your Subjects, and by conti|nual Reproachings and Reflections, endeavour to Repre&s;ent Your peaceable People as Enemies to your Per&s;on and Go|vernment, tho' they are, and ever have been, as Dutiful and Loyal as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Such may &s;ee their Practices di&s;courag'd by your Maje|&s;ties healing Example, and would do well to con&s;ider, that their peculiar Duty to your Maje&s;ty lies not in Recrimi|nating upon the Infirmities of others, but in Correcting their Own.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty has this compleat Satisfaction concerning all your Subjects, that the principal part of their Conten|tion is, which Party are mo&s;t Loyal to your Government; and among tho&s;e who Di&s;&s;ent from the Church, <HI>None of them</HI> Di&s;&s;ent from your Intere&s;t; and tho&s;e Gentlemen who would fain per&s;wade the World, that Tho&s;e who Di&s;&s;ent from the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick E&s;tabli&s;hment, are al&s;o Enemies to the Civil, have been driven to a Nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;uppos'd Extending the Civil Power beyond the Limits of the Laws, to bring tho&s;e People they would Expo&s;e, to &s;o much as a Temper of Objecting again&s;t it.&mdash;This is a Me|thod &s;o gro&s;ly Injurious to your Maje&s;ty, as well as to your Subjects, that it has been long earne&s;tly wi&s;h'd You would, on &s;ome Occa&s;ion or other, let them know how ill plea&s;ing it was, and how ill it Corre&s;ponded, both with your Maje&s;ties Principle as well as Practice, in all the parts of Your Go|vernment.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
'Tis an unhappy Violence the&s;e Men offer to Your Maje&s;ties Character, that they would be content to have your Maje&s;ty become a Tyrant, &s;o they might but be capable to prove the Di&s;&s;enters Di&s;loyal to your Government.</P>
<P>But as we ble&s;s God that your Maje&s;ty has re&s;olved to regulate your Government, <HI>by the great Foundation of all Government, the Laws</HI>; &s;o we cannot think we offend your Maje&s;ty in &s;aying, that in a full Obedience to your Government, and the Laws, none of your Subjects have ex|ceeded in Loyalty more than tho&s;e that have, at the &s;ame time, Di&s;&s;ented in &s;ome Point of Religion from the E&s;tab|li&s;h'd Church.</P>
<P>And among tho&s;e who thus Di&s;&s;ent, they who&s;e Principles are Hone&s;t, have always regarded the Church of <HI>England,</HI> with a Temper both of Charity and Re&s;pect; and 'tis to them a matter of no difficulty to entertain a Propo&s;al of Union in Affection and Intere&s;t, and to give all the Defference and Di&s;tinction in Government, to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church.</P>
<P>From whence, and your Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Generous Invita|tion to Peace, which, on all occa&s;ions, they mo&s;t readily Em|brace, they humbly hope the Heats and Animo&s;ities of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who Charge them with Di&s;loyalty of Principles, will, in Obedience to your Mo&s;t Gracious Speech to your Parlia|ment, <HI>be Buried and forgotten,</HI> that they may Enjoy, together with all your Loyal Subjects, the publick Favour and Pro|tection of their Sovereign, till they give your Maje&s;ty &s;ome ju&s;t Cau&s;e, <HI>which God forbid,</HI> to withdraw it from them.</P>
<P>And if this cannot be obtain'd, your Maje&s;ty, and all the World will be Witne&s;&s;es to their &s;incere De&s;ires, and forward Endeavours after <HI>the General Union of your Subjects,</HI> and will be effectually &s;atisfied at who&s;e Doors the black Charge will lye, and to whom we Owe all the un|happy Divi&s;ions of the Nation.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
Your Prote&s;tant Subjects, Madam, who, as Your Maje&s;ty once ob&s;erv'd, have the <HI>misfortune to Di&s;&s;ent from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,</HI> have yet a greater misfortune than that, Namely, to be Mi&s;repre&s;ented to Your Maje&s;ty as Ene|mies to Your Per&s;on and Government; but among all their Unhappine&s;s, they E&s;teem this as a Ble&s;&s;ing from Heaven, that they have now an Opportunity offer'd them to Convince Your Maje&s;ty of the hone&s;ty of their Principles, by being the forwarde&s;t to clo&s;e with Your Invitation of Peace and Union, as the Thing in all the World which mo&s;t &s;uites both their Practice and Inclination.</P>
<P>Humbly a&s;&s;uring Your Maje&s;ty, that as with the greate&s;t Thankfulne&s;s they receive the Expre&s;&s;ions of Your Earne&s;t Defires for the Peace and Union of all Your Subjects, &s;o, with a &s;teady Application, they re&s;olve to be the fir&s;t who &s;hall publickly Practice it, and endeavour to Expre&s;s their Zeal for the Publick Good, and Your Maje&s;ty's Glory, by heartily complying with what they were always Inclin'd to by their Principles and Inclinations, but much more by the Obedience their Duty Calls for to Your Maje&s;ty's Commands of Peace and Union.</P>
<P>The Humble&s;t of your Subjects, Madam, would have Sub&s;crib'd his Name to a Petition of Pardon, for the Pre|&s;umption of this Dedication; but that when he compares his De&s;picable Character with the Glorious Subject he has attempted to Advance; he cannot prevail upon him&s;elf to let the Cau&s;e &s;uffer by the Meane&s;s and Unworthine&s;s of the Advocate, and only Craves leave to a&s;&s;ure Your Maje&s;ty, that however he may have been Repre&s;ented, he is a pa&s;&s;ionate Admirer of Peace, an Earne&s;t Petitioner for the Pro&s;perity of Your Maje&s;ty, and this Kingdom, and the entire Union of all Your Subjects.</P>

<HEAD>A Challenge of PEACE, ADDRESS'D, <HI>To the whole NATION.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With an Enquiry into <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> for bringing it to pa&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN her Maje&s;ty in her Speech to the Parliament pre&s;s'd the Hou&s;e to Union and Peace, I believe 'twas Included, in her Royal Intentions, that we &s;hould all Under&s;tand her &s;peaking to the whole Nation, and that her Maje&s;ty would have all her Sub|jects &s;tudy Concord and Unanimity among them&s;elves in their Neighbourhood and Conver&s;e, as well as in the Councils and Debates of their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;uppo&s;e her Maje&s;ty &s;hould mean <HI>a Union of Opinions in Religion,</HI> for tho' I ought to believe her Maje&s;ty Wi&s;hes all her Prote&s;tant Subjects were of
<PB N="2" REF="9">
one mind with her &s;elf, and followed her Maje&s;ty in the &s;ame path to Heaven, yet, I cannot believe her Ma|je&s;ty &s;ees it &s;o probable as to expect it. But I &s;uppo&s;e her Maje&s;ty to mean that they &s;hould all Unite in Affection, where they differ in Opinion; Unite in In|tere&s;t, and Concur in their Obedience to the E&s;tab|li&s;h'd Government; Unite in a Unanimous Agreement of Management, and Unite as to Parties and Factions; Unite as <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> as Chri&s;tians, and as Prote&s;tants. This every good Chri&s;tian would be glad to &s;ee, and this every Man ought to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf Invited to in her Maje&s;ty's Speech.</P>
<P>If I am mi&s;taken, as I believe I am not, let any Man give me a Con&s;truction of her Speech more Genuine if they can.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sheets are de&s;ign'd as a Comment upon this Glorious Text, and further, to explain the Subject, and, if po&s;&s;ible, both de&s;cribe the Sence, and remove the Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>'Tis a mo&s;t fatal unhappy Circum&s;tance that every Body is for Peace, and yet no Body will bring it to pa&s;s; all Men agree that Peace is a Ble&s;|&s;ing from on High, that the want of it among our &s;elves Undoes us, Ruins our Preparations at Home, and our Expeditions Abroad, fills us with Fatal Parties, Facti|ons and Animo&s;ities; makes our Councils Confu&s;ed; Our War Tedious; Our De&s;igns Abortive, and our Felicity Precarious; want of Peace and Unity among our &s;elves makes our Arms le&s;s Fear'd, our Friend|&s;hip le&s;s Courted, and, in &s;hort, is the only thing in the World can ever Ruine us.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded there's not a Man in the Nation but concurs in the&s;e Generals; but when you come to &s;peak of the particular Steps to be taken to obtain
<PB N="3" REF="10">
this Ble&s;&s;ed Article of the Nation's Happine&s;s, all Men are for having their Neighbours &s;toop to their Opini|ons, but wont yield a jot of their own; they are for making Abatements for other Men, but admit of none for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To come directly to the Point concerning this Union of Parties, I think 'tis nece&s;&s;ary a little to Examine the Negatives, which are not the ways to obtain this Ble&s;&s;ing. As</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Bloody Flag of Defiance is not the Way to Peace and Union, <HI>the &s;horte&s;t Way to De&s;troy, is not the &s;horte&s;t Way to Unite,</HI> Per&s;ecu|tion, Laws to Compel, Re&s;train, or force the Con|&s;ciences of one another, is not the Way to this Union, which her Maje&s;ty has &s;o earne&s;tly Recommended.</P>
<P>Secondly, To Repeal or Contract the late Act of Tolleration, is not the Way for this &s;o much wi&s;h'd for Happine&s;s; to have Laws reviv'd that &s;hould &s;et one Party a Plundering, Excommunicating and Un|churching another, that &s;hould renew the Oppre&s;|&s;ions and Deva&s;tations of late Reigns, this will not, by any means, Contribute to this Peace, which all good Men de&s;ire.</P>
<P>New A&s;&s;ociations and Propo&s;als to dive&s;t Men of their Free-hold Right for Differences in Opinion, and take away the Right of Di&s;&s;enters Voting in Elections of Members; this is not the way to Peace and Union.</P>
<P>Railing Pamphlets buffooning our Brethren as a Party to be &s;uppre&s;s'd, and dre&s;&s;ing them up in the Bare's Skin for all the Dogs in the Street to bait them, is not the way to Peace and Union.</P>
<P>Railing Sermons, exciting People to Hatred and Contempt of their Brethren, becau&s;e they Differ in O|pinions, is not the way to Peace and Union.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">
Shutting all People out of Employment, and the Service of their Prince and Country, unle&s;s they can Comply with indifferent Ceremonies of Religion, is far from the way to Peace and Union.</P>
<P>Reproaching the Succe&s;&s;ion, &s;ettled by Parliament, and Reviving the Abdicated Title of the late K. <HI>James,</HI> and his &s;uppos'd Family, cannot tend to this Peace and Union.</P>
<P>Laws again&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> and Compelling People who bear Offices to a Total Conformity, and yet Force them to take and &s;erve in tho&s;e publick Employ|ments, cannot contribute to Peace and Union.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the <HI>Negativae,</HI> &s;ome of the imme|diate Contraries, the Oppo&s;ites to this ble&s;&s;ed Peace and Union, which her Maje&s;ty has Recommended to the whole Nation; while the&s;e things are practis'd or allow'd, I doubt her Maje&s;ty will be defeated of the Expectation She has from the Exhortation She has been pleas'd to make. The Breaches are too wide, the Wound too deep, and ranckl'd almo&s;t to a Gangreen, and if it goes long without a Cure, will certainly come to Am|putation of Members, or to a Mortification of Parts. The Breaches of Parties, if not ended in a healing A|greement, will certainly end in the Suppre&s;&s;ion, if not the De&s;truction, of one Party, if not of all.</P>
<P>The Ways and Means for this Nation's De&s;truction are very plain and obvious; they are all within our &s;elves; they are begun, and carried on, by our Selves; We dig the Grave of the Common-Wealth with our own hands; the fire of Di&s;cord will burn up the very Bowels of the Nation, and Con&s;ume us in&s;en&s;ibly, and all owing to the civil Fury of contending Parties. No Nation can de&s;troy <HI>England</HI> but it &s;elf, and if the Feuds, and Heat of Parties continue, no Nation can prevent our De&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">
Her Maje&s;ty &s;en&s;ible of the evil Con&s;equence, has gi|ven a large and very &s;ea&s;onable Caution, and &s;olemnly In|vites all the Nation to lay a&s;ide the Contention of Par|ties, to embrace Peace, Love, Unity, and Conjunction of Intere&s;ts, that uniting Hearts and Hands in the com|mon Defence, the whole Government may be &s;trength|ened, her Maje&s;ty the more chearfully A&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the Publick Burthen &s;u&s;tain'd.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Ends all good Prote&s;tants ought to Contribute, as far as in them lyes; but as all Parties mu&s;t yield part of their pre&s;ent &s;tifne&s;s to the great Con|junction her Maje&s;ty de&s;ires, I thought it might not be improper to let all Sides &s;ee &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Steps, which they not only &s;hould, but mu&s;t, and ought, to take, in order to make this Heavenly Work po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive all the pre&s;ent Di&s;cord of this Na|tion may be comprehended in the&s;e Two,<LIST>
<ITEM>Differences in Religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Differences in Intere&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>One concerns the <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> and the other the <HI>E&s;tate,</HI> but both are &s;o twi&s;ted together, that it &s;eems as if there were no Broil but about Religion, and that <HI>the Church was the only Bone of Contention.</HI></P>
<P>But as they have generally Lea&s;t of Religion who Contend mo&s;t about it, &s;o in the publick Strife of Par|ties, there &s;eems to be a Colour of Religion plac'd up|on the General Contention, but really, at the bottom, the whole Quarrel is guided by the Intere&s;ts of Parties, Places, Preferments, to get Some in, and Some out, this &s;eems the main Thing in hand.</P>
<P>Parties Contend to get into the Executive Power, that they may put all their Friends into the great Pla|ces, and Offices of the Crown.</P>
<P>Some would have &s;uch a King, or &s;uch a Family to Succeed to the Crown, and why? Not &s;o much becau&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="13">
this King, or Prince, or Family, is of this, of that Reli|gion, but becau&s;e they are of &s;uch, or &s;uch a Party, and then &s;uch and &s;uch Friends get into Employment.</P>
<P>I don't &s;ay 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile Parties, wave Differences, and bring all to a Temper of Peace, but there is &s;o much to be done, &s;o much Self-Denial of Practice requir'd, that I dare not &s;ay, <HI>I hope to &s;ee it brought to pa&s;s;</HI> and yet I &s;hall not de&s;cend to Particulars, in order only to &s;how the Difficulty, and &s;o Di&s;courage the Work; but to let you &s;ee, that tho' it may be Difficult, 'tis not Impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Article of <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> to this Peace mu&s;t be found in the general Temper of the Nation. There mu&s;t be a Propen&s;ity, a general Inclination to Yield and Bend to one another. 'Tis Non&s;ence to talk of Particulars, if the general Bent of Men's Thoughts are not fir&s;t brought to Love, Seek, and De&s;ire Peace; and were this once produc'd, Could any probable Steps be taken in this part, Could there be but an appearance of a Peaceable Temper in the Nation, the re&s;t of the Work would be found ea&s;ier than we imagin; all Differences would vani&s;h, did but the Inclination to <HI>Difference</HI> vani&s;h; did the wrangling Temper cea&s;e, were but the Spirit of Con|tention taken away, the Cau&s;es of Contention would not be &s;o eagerly embrac'd: This is the Tinder of the Nation, which is &s;o ready to catch hold of the Fire of Di&s;&s;ention; this unhappine&s;s of Temper has been an Old and Epidemick Di&s;ea&s;e, and has got &s;uch ground among us, 'twill be very hard to have any thing but &s;ome publick Calamity to Cure it; Affliction reconciles Friends, Common Dangers unite Nations, and Settle disjointed Parties; All are oblig'd to join in Common Defence.</P>
<P>But 'tis very hard, as well as unkind to our Selves, that we can never be in a Condition to be Reconcil'd to
<PB N="7" REF="14">
one another, till we are ju&s;t at the Door of being ruin'd; That nothing but Enemies can per&s;wade us to be Friends, and the more violent our A&s;&s;aults are from Abroad; the more forward our Peace is at Home; from whence that Ver&s;e &s;eems to be verified of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> <Q><L>and by far,</L><L>Harder to Rule in Times of Peace than War.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now &s;eems a prevaling Juncture to reduce us to a Temper of Peace; forreign Wars, tho' we feel them not in our own Bowels, yet one would think they have pre&s;ented a Field &s;pacious enough to vent all our Gall and ill Temper in, tho' the War has not been &s;o Con|&s;iderable, as to put us out of our Selves for fear, yet it has not been &s;o incon&s;iderable, as not to afford us &s;uffici|ent Rea&s;on for Unity, Union of Councils, Union of Pur|&s;es, Hands and Hearts are all little enough.</P>
<P>But 'tis in vain to talk of Union till the Temper of Di&s;united Parties is brought over to de&s;ire it, we may Unite in Words, but we &s;hall never do it in Affection, till all People are willing; Pretences of Union tend but to the widening the Breach, and is like Hypocri&s;y in Religion, Repre&s;ented in Scripture, by <HI>Drawing near to God with the Mouth, when the Heart is far from him.</HI> He that pre&s;&s;es his Argument for this Temper, &s;hould direct his Speech to all Parties, and to all &s;uch I freely &s;ay, they who have not this Temper of Peace, who do not encline to Union of Intere&s;t, and Union of Affecti|on, are blind to the publick Benefit of their Native Country, Enemies to the pre&s;ent Government, Di&s;re|&s;pectful and Di&s;loyal to her Maje&s;ty, and Underminers of their own Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>It may be expected very rationally, that I &s;hou'd enter into the particulars of Parties, and Examine who have mo&s;t need to be Exhorted to Union and Peace;
<PB N="8" REF="15">
and tho' I would not be Partial to Parties, yet I cannot help advancing this general Head, that the main Arti|cle of Di&s;&s;ention, Strife and Contention, lies now on tho&s;e Gentlemen who call them&s;elves <HI>High-Church-Men.</HI> Who can the Invitation to Peace mean, but tho&s;e People who <HI>want the Hint.</HI> 'Tis plain neither the Mo|derate Church-men, nor the Di&s;&s;enters, can be meant. For they are de&s;irous of Peace; it is their Intere&s;t, their Principle, and their Inclination; the Temper &s;eems to be plainly &s;een there.</P>
<P><HI>The High Church-men</HI> &s;ay, they are for Peace; but they are for Peace without Union; they are for the Peace of Subjection; they would have all be Peace, that is, their feet on the Necks of their Enemies: But 'tis Peace and Union the Queen has Spoke for, and 'tis <HI>to the&s;e Gentlemen</HI> the Speech is directed, for they chiefly &s;tand in need of the Exhortation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Men who carry the heat of their Arguments out to the Extream of Reproach, and the Indecency of Contempt; the&s;e are the Men that Print, Preach, and Crie up all Modern Di&s;contents that &s;trive to blacken their Brethren with Marks of Di&s;tinction; the&s;e are they that have Stigmatiz'd all the Men of Moderation, with the Brand of Low-Church-men, and all other Writings Repre&s;ent them as Traytors to their Friends, to the Church, and to their own Principles, wor&s;e than Di&s;&s;enters, Fanaticks or Schi&s;maticks; and yet all I can find the&s;e Gentlemen Charg'd with, is, that they are not for <HI>tearing People to pieces for Religion, and ruining their Di&s;&s;enting Brethren the Shorte&s;t Way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e are the Gentlemen</HI> who have lifted up the <HI>Bloody Flag</HI> again&s;t their Prote&s;tant Neighbours, and declared, that all the True Church-men are bound to Li&s;t in the New <HI>Cru&s;ado</HI> of the Church.</P>

<P>The&s;e things being remov'd, the Di&s;&s;enters are na|turally at ea&s;e; the Liberty of their Per&s;ons, &s;afety of their Properties and Birth right, and the Tolleration of their Con&s;ciences are the full of all their demand; and the&s;e being &s;ecur'd, we may &s;afely defye all the Power of Malice to charge upon them the breach of the Publick-quiet, or any Encroachment upon the Go|vernment, their Nighbours, or the Laws.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;aults of their intemperate Adver&s;aries may have fill'd them with ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions, that the &s;ub. ver&s;ion of their Liberty is de&s;ign'd, and they will perhaps be ready to &s;ay they have good Rea&s;on for it; but as her Maje&s;ty has always Comforted them with the full A&s;&s;urance of her Royal Word in that Ca&s;e, they have always behav'd with Duty and Defe|rence to her Maje&s;ty, and every part of her Govern|ment; and let tho&s;e who have &s;o openly attempted to prove the Di&s;&s;enters fatal to the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, and con&s;equently have propo&s;ed to have them depriv'd of their Birth-right as Free-holders, let them give an in&s;tance of One Act of di&s;loyalty which they have been Guilty of to her Maje&s;ty, to merit &s;o much her Royal di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters therefore do not come in as the im|mediate Subjects of this Exhortation to Peace, their Circum&s;tances, their Intere&s;ts, their Number, their E&s;tates oblige them to Peace, and they cannot be Fomenters of our Breaches and Divi&s;ions, without be|ing

Fools and Mad-men, blind to their own happine&s;s, and <HI>Thieves to their Po&s;terity.</HI></P>
<P>If this ble&s;&s;ed Motion of peace affects the Di&s;&s;enters at all, it mu&s;t be as it re&s;pects the <HI>Conduct of them|&s;elves to them&s;elves;</HI> the infinite Feuds, Divi&s;ions and Animo&s;ities harbour'd among their &s;eparate Parties, and daily expre&s;t again&s;t one another, is too much a &s;candal upon them as Chri&s;tians, and too much re|proaches their Morals as Men: And here 'tis to be acknowledg'd they de&s;erve reproof, and cannot defend them&s;elves, wherefore they are mo&s;t ju&s;tly call'd upon by her Maje&s;ty's Speech, and by the whole Nation to hearken to Peace.</P>
<P>Their Character as Chri&s;tians, their Pretences of more than Common Reformation, their Intere&s;t as a Party, their Profe&s;&s;ion, their God and their Queen all call upon them to Peace and Union; Uni|on of Affection, if not Union of Profe&s;&s;ion; Union of Practice, if not Union of Principle.</P>
<P>Having thus run through the Parties who are con|cern'd in this matter, it leads me to repeat to my Reader, that were the temper of peace, were the propen&s;ity to a general Union, fix'd in the Brea&s;ts of the&s;e Parties, there might be &s;ome hopes that a further progre&s;s might be made; but there mu&s;t fir&s;t be an inclination to Peace, before there can be any real Foundation to hope for it: I know nothing in the World could have been a greater &s;tep to form this inclination in the Minds of all Parties, than the vehemence with which her Maje&s;ty has been pleas'd to recommend it in her Speech; 'Tis a call from Heaven by the Mouth of the Queen, and doubtle&s;s her Maje&s;ty was in&s;pir'd from thence, to move that particular Article of her Speech with &s;o
<PB N="14" REF="21">
much uncommon earne&s;tne&s;s, that tho&s;e whoever en|tertain'd any thoughts of her Maje&s;ty's being b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t by a Party, might &s;ee their mi&s;take; that the Party them|&s;elves, who began too much to depend upon her Pa|tronage in their ill De&s;igns, might be di&s;courag'd, and that all her People might &s;ee her Maje&s;ty was entirely engag'd in the general Intere&s;t of her People's good, without re&s;pect to Parties, to Faction, or the private projects of de&s;igning People about her.</P>
<P>For my part, I confe&s;s my &s;elf &s;urpris'd with Joy, to find her Maje&s;ty's Eyes open to the general Happi|ne&s;s of her People, and &s;hould take it for a Judgment upon the Nation, if the Peoples Eyes &s;hould remain &s;hut to their own felicity, and that Feuds and Parties &s;hould have run us to that extreme, that even a healing Monarch cannot Unite us.</P>
<P>It has not been a common thing for the Nation to be Summon'd to Unity and Peace from the Throne; evil Princes have been &s;hye and jealous of the Union of their Subjects, and maintaining and keeping up the Jealou&s;ies and Animo&s;ities of Parties, has been thought a needful policy to protect the Crown. But this Pra|ctice has been a ju&s;t Satyr upon tho&s;e Princes that al|low'd it, as a certain Demon&s;tration they had &s;ome|thing <HI>to impo&s;e,</HI> which nothing but the private Feuds of Parties could bring them to con&s;ent to.</P>
<P>The Union of Subjects is the Dread of Tyrants; for no People in the World would bear the In&s;ults and Cruelties of Encroaching Arbitrary Princes, were not the People them&s;elves divided in Intere&s;ts, Parties,
<PB N="15" REF="22">
Factions and De&s;igns. It is a token for good to the People of <HI>England,</HI> that the Queen, however by a &s;ort of men &s;he has been mi&s;repre&s;ented and abus'd, has yet this Te&s;timony to give the World of her Ju&s;tice, and the Integrity of her De&s;igns, that &s;he covets that Peace among all her People, which &s;ome of her Ar|bitrary Ance&s;tors have been afraid to bring upon the Stage.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of being afraid of the Union of her Subjects, &s;he is of nothing more de&s;irous than to bring out that ble&s;&s;ed Article, to &s;ee all her Subjects practi&s;ing Cha|rity and Kindne&s;s one to another. The Rea&s;on is plain, her Maje&s;ty having regulated her Conduct by the Laws, and confin'd her De&s;ires to the Happine&s;s of her People, &s;he can give no Te&s;timony of it like this, that &s;he covets to &s;ee them United in the Bonds of Love, and walking Hand in Hand in her Ser|vice.</P>
<P>None but Tyrants covet to be fear'd, Ju&s;t Prin|ces value them&s;elves upon the Love of their Peo|ple.</P>
<Q>The Hearts of Subjects are the Strength of Kings.</Q>
<P>Now 'tis impracticable to have all the People joyn in Duty and Affection to their Prince, while they are embroyl'd with heat and pa&s;&s;ions one with another; <HI>univer&s;al Love, makes univer&s;al Loyalty:</HI> No Subjects are &s;o true to their Prince, nor &s;o hearty to his Cau&s;e, as tho&s;e who are United among them&s;elves, and Unanimous in their way of living.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23">
While therefore her Maje&s;ty invites all her Subjects to Union and Peace, 'tis a certain Indication of her re&s;olv'd De&s;ign to Govern this Nation by the Laws, and pre&s;erve the Rights and Liberties of her Subjects: She would el&s;e be very unwilling the People &s;hould have any endearing Conver&s;ation among them&s;elves, lea&s;t one time or other they &s;hould open their Eyes to &s;ee the way to Liberty, and ca&s;t off the yoak of their intended Slavery. But if her Maje&s;ty calls us to Peace, &s;he calls us to Freedom, and lets us know She is far from encouraging the mi&s;chievous De&s;igns of tho&s;e who &s;trive to bring in di&s;truction at the door of Contention, and who are willing to keep up the &s;trife of the People, that they might not agree in their own deliverance.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my &s;elf &s;urpriz'd at this di&s;covery of the Royal intentions to Peace and Union, and that I ex|pected not her Maje&s;ty had yet &s;een far enough into the malicious De&s;igns of that Party, who de&s;ign'd to engage her on one part of her people again&s;t the other, and have had many a melancholy Pro&s;pect of the con&s;equences of a Nation divided again&s;t her &s;elf: Nor do I know any way in the World to have given that hot Temper &s;o Univer&s;al an overthrow, as her Maje&s;ty has now taken, <HI>viz.</HI> To let them know that what ever they may expect from her, how much &s;oever they may fancy they plea&s;e her in running down One Party to rai&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h another, <HI>her Maje&s;ty is not of their Mind.</HI> The Queen knows a better way to hold the Ballance of Parties, than to erect any One upon the de&s;truction of another; what ever the Opinions in Religion are, they are all her Maje&s;ties Subjects, they have all a Title to her Protection, while
<PB N="17" REF="24">
they behave them&s;elves Dutifuly to her Per&s;on and Government; reconciling their Plrinciples is none of her Maje&s;ty's Province as Queen, and if it were, &s;eems but too impracticable; but to reconcile their Per&s;ons, make them u&s;eful to her &s;elf, conver&s;ible to one ano|ther, quiet and obedient to the Laws and her Go|vernment, this her Maje&s;ty profe&s;&s;es to De&s;ire, is Her Re&s;olution, and all her People's advantage.</P>
<P>In Concurrence with this De&s;ign, 'tis our Bu|&s;ine&s;s to &s;trive who is the forwarde&s;t for Peace, that her Maje&s;ty may be convinc'd who are the Incendia|ries of the Nation; <HI>Mark &s;uch as &s;ow Divi&s;ions:</HI> let us Mark our &s;elves for Vi&s;ible Healers of Divi&s;ions, and the Contrary will mark the Wideners of Our Breaches.</P>
<P>As I have Undertaken to advance in the behalf of the Di&s;&s;enters, that they are the forwarde&s;t to Embrace this Univer&s;al Peace, &s;o I hope I &s;hall not be a&s;ham'd to affirm, That both their Intere&s;t and their Principles Concur to pre&s;s them to it, and I yet hope their Pra|ctice will not let me, nor any One who Undertakes the Vindication of their Cau&s;e, be a&s;ham'd of being their Advocate.</P>
<P>They cannot be Enemies to this Reconciliation of Parties, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time they have lo&s;t their Sen&s;es, and are qualifying them&s;elves for <HI>Bedlam;</HI> and I am of the Opinion, that had a General A&s;&s;embly of all the Di&s;&s;enters in this Nation been met together, to Con&s;ider what they would De&s;ire her Maje&s;ty to do for them, I mean for them particularly as Di&s;&s;enters, they could have thought of nothing more material to them and the whole Nation, than a Ce&s;&s;ation of this Party Strife, and a Civil Union with all the re&s;t of her Maje&s;ty's Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25">
What el&s;e had they to ask? Their Properties are &s;ecur'd by the Law, their Religion by the Tolleration, and both rea&s;&s;ur'd by the Queen's repeated Promi&s;es to Continue them. They Could have nothing more to ask, but that her Maje&s;ty would do what in her Wi&s;dom &s;he &s;hould find Conducing to a general Peace and U|nion of Affection, between them and tho&s;e People from whom they were oblig'd to Di&s;&s;ent in Point of Religion.</P>
<P>This her Maje&s;ty has done without their Application, and I think the Di&s;&s;enters cannot an&s;wer it to the Sen&s;e of their Own Intere&s;t, if they do not make publick acknowledgment to God and Her Maje&s;ty for &s;o remarkable a Mercy.</P>
<P>Had we Beaten the <HI>French</HI> Fleet at Sea, or had any more than Ordinary Advantage over the Nation's Ene|mies been Obtained; We &s;hould, and rea&s;on good, have made a Day of publick Rejoycing and Thank&s;giving to God for &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, and by Addre&s;&s;es of Congratulation Complimented her Maje&s;ty upon that head.</P>
<P>This is a Victory over the wor&s;t Enemy the Na|tion has, an Enemy the mo&s;t Fatal and mo&s;t Formi|dable of any in the World; Contention is the Devil's Generali&s;&s;imo, that has always led on the Infernal Troops to Invade the Peace of this Unhappy Nation; Her Maje&s;ty has given an Overthrow to the Grand Army of Hell, and Di&s;pers'd the Numerous Squadrons that were Embatteling them&s;elves again&s;t the general Quiet,

and who verily thought they had the Queen on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>It remains for all Her Subjects to pur&s;ue the flying Troops of this Defeated Army, and to de&s;troy and remove all the little Foundations of Party Feuds, Fears, Jealou&s;ies, Reproaches, and Raillery that blow up the Grand Flame of Di&s;cord in the Nation.</P>
<P>Would all Parties fall in heartily with Her Ma|je&s;ty's Command, a General Ki&s;s of Friend&s;hip and Reconciliation would pa&s;s thro' the&s;e three Kingdoms, the Wolf and the Lamb would lye down together, Peace would &s;mother all the remains of Enmity, and the Seeds of Di&s;&s;ention would Dye in the Earth, and &s;pring up no more.</P>
<P>And that I may not &s;eem to pre&s;s my Readers to think of what I cannot direct them how to do. I think it not improper to &s;ay, this Work is not Difficult, 'tis ea&s;ier to agree than to fall out, if Men were all en|clin'd to Peace.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend in the &s;hort Compa&s;s of the&s;e Sheets, to draw a full Scheem of a Project of Peace a|mong the General Parties, nor unle&s;s I were Directed would I engage in any thing &s;o Nice, having no need to feel the further Re&s;entment of tho&s;e who may no more be pleas'd with the Project, than they are with the Per&s;on. But I will Venture to touch the Preliminaries, and tell the People of <HI>England</HI> how they may begin, I'le put them into the Road, in which if they plea&s;e but to go on <HI>&s;traight forward,</HI> as
<PB N="20" REF="27">
they &s;ay, they cannot fail to arrive at the Port of Peace.</P>
<P>Not at all to concern matters of Religion and Opinions about wor&s;hipping God with our Civil Affairs, and common Charity, leaving all People freely, as now the Laws do, to the dictates of the Spirit, and the con|duct of their Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>Religion is a matter of Peace, <HI>the ways of God are ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all his Paths are Peace,</HI> which tho' it means &s;peculative Peace, yet I may apply it here; there is nothing in Religion which has a tendency to &s;owre our Tempers, ruffle our Conver&s;ation, or di&s;order our Lives. As to Converting one another, the Scripture is full of Rules to direct us to act in that by the Power of Per&s;wa&s;ion; even Re|proof is to be done with the Spirit of Meekne&s;s, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle and Rebuking one a|nother in Love, and provoking one another to Love and to good Works; and if the Scripture were &s;ilent in the ca&s;e, the Rea&s;on and Nature of the thing &s;eems to imply, that all coercive Methods are vain as well as unlawful, as to Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Experience might convince tho&s;e Sons of Violence who are for Per&s;ecution of their Neighbours, that it has been a fruitle&s;s War; and if we were to examine how many Converts to the Church have been made by &s;uch Mea&s;ures, I doubt they can give but a &s;len|der account of the Fruit of that Method whereof the whole Church is now a&s;ham'd. I &s;ay a&s;ham'd, for that <HI>In</HI> the Preamble to a late Bill for the preventing
<PB N="21" REF="28">
Occa&s;ional Conformity, 'tis there own'd, <HI>that Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience is Contrary to the Principles of the Chri&s;ti|an Religion, and to the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P>I avoid all the ju&s;t Examples I could give of the Irregularities and Oppre&s;&s;ions the Di&s;&s;enters have &s;uf|fer'd under on this head; that I may begin with my &s;elf, and bury the remembrances of Violences and ill U&s;age, in this new Re&s;olution of Peace which we are all invited to by her Maje&s;ty, and which I hope all the Di&s;&s;enters in the Nation will be the mo&s;t forward to accept.</P>
<P>But as to future Conduct let matters of Religion be things of &s;erious Choice, but not of Violence and Debate, we may Differ but not Quarrel; we may Di&s;&s;ent, without Cen&s;ure and Uncharitablene&s;s; they may Conform, without Envy and Reproach; Hone&s;t Men &s;hould agree with hone&s;t Men, of what&s;oever Opinion they may be, and not with Knaves what&s;oever Party they take. <HI>A little Charity &s;own on good Land would produce a huge Crop of Peace.</HI> And e|ven Grace it &s;elf, planted in a &s;oil barren of Charity, &s;ours and grows moro&s;e.</P>
<P>What has Religion to do with Politicks? Hone&s;t Men of all Per&s;wa&s;ions are hone&s;t Men, and Knaves are the wor&s;e, the more pretence they make to Reli|gion; we &s;hould not have a tenth part of the Diffe|rences in State-Affairs, did not Church-matters and State-matters mingle &s;o much together.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29">
The Law has plac'd the Admini&s;tration in the hands of the Church, and tho' there has been a thou&s;and reviling Pamphlets that have accus'd the Di&s;&s;enters of repining at it, yet not one Di&s;&s;enter can be charg'd with a De&s;ign to alter it; let but Peace and moderate Princi|ples po&s;&s;e&s;s the Men of Government, the Di&s;&s;enters were always content, and ever will be pleas'd to have the Power re&s;t in the hands of the Church; and where this Peace and Moderation is not, I believe all men will grant me that the principal Qualifications for Go|vernment are wanting.</P>
<P>'Tis nothing but the want of this Peace and Mode|ration, which has made the matters of Religion and Government Cla&s;h, and the whole Nation fall out about them; and if any Man &s;hall attempt to prove that this contentious Spirit has been on the &s;ide of the Di&s;&s;enters, I think I may not be tax'd with Arrogance, if I &s;ay I can ea&s;ily con&s;ute him.</P>
<P>But however it has been, <HI>for Peace never Recrimi|nates,</HI> I &s;hall adventure in the Name of the Di&s;&s;enters, pre&s;uming upon their univer&s;al Con&s;ent, and with the Con&s;ent of &s;ome of the mo&s;t Judicious among them, to make their Adver&s;aries this fair Challenge.</P>
<P>Let the &s;incerity of the peaceable Spirit be try'd by the Con&s;equence: The Queen has made a general In|vitation to Peace and Union, and we accept it; let her Maje&s;ty now &s;ee who are her mo&s;t Loyal Subjects, who are greate&s;t Friends to the general Intere&s;t, and the true&s;t Lovers of their Country, by di&s;tingui&s;hing among them who have mo&s;t regard to her earne&s;t Recommen|dation,

and who are really and unfeignedly of peace|able Tempers and Principles, and who are not; who are mo&s;t for Peace and Union, who readie&s;t to obey their Soveraign's Command, who hone&s;te&s;t to their own Pretences, the High Church-Men or the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>If this Challenge would be accepted, if per&s;ons de|puted by both Parties were to meet, how ea&s;ie would it be to &s;ettle Conditions of mutual Society, agreement of Parties, and general Charity in the whole Nation, which whoever would break, &s;hould be hi&s;t out of all Conver&s;ation, contemn'd by all &s;ides, and no body care to &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>All this might be done, and Religion never be con|cern'd in the matter, the Concerns of Con&s;cience would be a Cla&s;s by it &s;elf, and never make a rupture in our Civil Society; Men would be Gentlemen as well as Chri&s;tians, and the Union of Conver&s;ation and Intere&s;t would make a little Heaven in the Nation.</P>
<P>We &s;hould no more be cutting of Throats about Re|ligion, and &s;ending one another to the Devil for not going to Heaven our own way.</P>
<P>This would be the Shorte&s;t way with the Di&s;&s;enters, and <HI>Sachavrell</HI>'s bloody Flag would be a Fool to it.</P>
