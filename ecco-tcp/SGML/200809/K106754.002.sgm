<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mi&s;s Milner arrived at Bath, &s;he thought it the mo&s;t altered place &s;he ever &s;aw&mdash;&s;he was mi&s;taken&mdash; it was &s;he her&s;elf, who was changed.</P>
<P>The walks were melancholy, the company in&s;ipid, the ball-room fatigue|ing &mdash; in fine, &s;he had left behind, all that could charm or plea&s;e her.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">Though &s;he found her&s;elf far le&s;s hap|py than when &s;he was at Bath before, yet &s;he felt, &s;he would not, to enjoy all that pa&s;t happine&s;s, be again reduced to the being &s;he was at that time. Thus, does the lover con&s;ider the extinction of his pa&s;&s;ion, with the &s;ame horror as the li|bertine looks upon annihilation; the one would rather live hereafter (though in all the tortures with which his future &s;tate is de&s;cribed) than cea&s;e to exi&s;t; &s;o there are no tortures a lover would not &s;uffer, rather than cea&s;e to love.</P>
<P>In the wide pro&s;pect of melancholy before her, Mi&s;s Milner's fancy caught hold of the only comfort which pre|&s;ented it&s;elf; and this, &s;lender as it was, in the total ab&s;ence of every other, her imagination pictured as exce&s;&s;ive. The
<PB N="3" REF="4">
comfort was a letter from Mi&s;s Wood|ley&mdash;a letter wherein the &s;ubject of her love would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be mentioned, and in whatever terms, mu&s;t &s;till be the means of delight.</P>
<P>A letter arrived &mdash; &s;he devoured it with her eyes.&mdash;The po&s;t mark on the out&s;ide denoting from whence it came, the name of "Milner Lodge" written on the top, were all &s;ources of plea&s;ure &mdash; and &s;he read &s;lowly every line it contained to procra&s;tinate the plea&s;ing expectation &s;he enjoyed, till &s;he &s;hould arrive at the name of Dorriforth. At la&s;t her impatient eye, caught the word three lines beyond the place &s;he was reading&mdash;irre&s;i&s;tibly, &s;he &s;kipped over tho&s;e lines, and fixed on the point to which &s;he was attracted.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">Mi&s;s Woodley was cautious in her indulgence; &s;he made the &s;lighte&s;t mention of Dorriforth, &s;aying only, "He was extremely concerned, and even de|jected, at the little hope there was of his cou&s;in, lord Elmwood's, recovery."&mdash; Short and trivial as this pa&s;&s;age was, it was &s;till more important to Mi&s;s Milner than any other in the letter&mdash;&s;he read it again and again, con&s;idered, and re|flected upon it.&mdash;Dejected, thought &s;he, what does that word exactly mean?&mdash; did I ever &s;ee Mr. Dorriforth dejected? &mdash;how I wonder does he look in that &s;tate?&mdash;Thus did &s;he mu&s;e, while the cau&s;e of his dejection, though a mo&s;t &s;erious one, and pathetically de&s;cribed by Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;carce arre&s;ted her attention once. &mdash; She run over with ha&s;te the account of lord Elmwood's
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;tate of health; &s;he certainly pitied him while &s;he thought of him, but &s;he did not think of him long. To die was a hard fate for a young nobleman ju&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his immen&s;e fortune, and on the eve of marriage with a beautiful young woman; but Mi&s;s Milner thought Heaven might be &s;till better than all this, and &s;he had no doubt but his lord&s;hip would go there. The forlorn &s;tate of Mi&s;s Fenton ought to have been a &s;ubject for compa&s;&s;ion, but &s;he knew that lady had re&s;ignation to bear any lot with pati|ence, and that a trial of her fortitude, might be more flattering to her vanity than to be counte&s;s of Elmwood: in a word, &s;he &s;aw nobody's misfortunes equal to her own, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw no one &s;o little able to bear misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">She replied to Mi&s;s Woodley's let|ter, and dwelt very long on that &s;ubject which Mi&s;s Woodley had taken care to pa&s;s over lightly; this was another in|dulgence; and to hear from, and to write to her friend, were now the only enjoyments &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. From Bath Mi&s;s Milner paid &s;everal fe&s;tive vi&s;its with lady Luneham &mdash; all were alike tedious and melancholy.</P>
<P>But her guardian wrote to her, and though the &s;ubject was &s;orrowful, the letter gave her joy&mdash;the &s;entiments it expre&s;&s;ed were but trite and com|mon-place, yet &s;he valued them as the deare&s;t effu&s;ions of friend&s;hip and af|fection; and her hand trembled, and her heart beat with rapture while &s;he wrote the an&s;wer, though &s;he knew it would
<PB N="7" REF="8">
not be received with one emotion, &s;uch as tho&s;e which &s;he experienced. In her &s;econd letter to Mi&s;s Woodley &s;he pray|ed like a per&s;on in&s;ane to be taken home from confinement, and like a lu|natick prote&s;ted, in &s;en&s;ible language, &s;he "had no di&s;order." But her friend replied, "that very declaration proves its violence." And a&s;&s;ured her that nothing le&s;s than placing her affections el&s;ewhere, &s;hould induce her to believe, but that &s;he was incura|ble.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley's third letter acquainted Mi&s;s Milner with the death of lord Elm|wood&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley was exceedingly affected by this event, and &s;aid little el&s;e on any other &s;ubject.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner was &s;hocked when &s;he read the words "he is dead," and for a moment thought,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
"How tran&s;ient are all &s;ublunary things!&mdash;within a few years <HI>I</HI> &s;hall be dead&mdash;and how felicitous will it then be, if I have re&s;i&s;ted every temptation to the delu&s;ive plea&s;ures of this life!" &mdash; The happine&s;s of a peaceful death occupied her contemplation for near an hour; but at length every vir|tuous and pious &s;entiment this medita|tion in&s;pired, &s;erved but to remind her of the many &s;entences &s;he had heard fall from her guardian's lips upon the &s;ame &s;ubject&mdash;her thoughts were again fixed on him, and &s;he could think of nothing be&s;ide.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time after, her health became impaired from the indi&s;po&s;ition of her mind; &s;he langui&s;hed, and was once in imminent danger. During a &s;light delirium of her fever, Mi&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Woodley's name and her guardian's were repeated ince&s;&s;antly; lady Lune|ham &s;ent them immediate word of this, and they both ha&s;tened to Bath, and ar|rived there, ju&s;t as her di&s;order had taken a mo&s;t favourable turn. As &s;oon as &s;he became perfectly recollected, her fir&s;t care was, knowing the frailty of her heart, to enquire what &s;he had ut|tered while delirious.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley, who was by her bed-&s;ide, begged her not to be alarmed on that account, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he knew, from all her at|tendants, that &s;he had only &s;poken with a friendly remembrance (as was really the ca&s;e) of tho&s;e per&s;ons who were dear to her.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed to know whether her guardian was come to &s;ee her, but &s;he had not the courage to a&s;k before Mi&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Woodley; and her friend was afraid by the too &s;udden mention of his name to di&s;compo&s;e her. Her woman, how|ever, after &s;ome little time, entered the chamber and whi&s;pered Mi&s;s Wood|ley. Mi&s;s Milner a&s;ked inqui&s;itively "What &s;he &s;aid?" and the woman go|ing to her, replied &s;oftly, "Lord Elm|wood, madam, would wi&s;h to come and &s;ee you for a few moments, if you will allow him?" Mi&s;s Milner turned her head, and &s;tared wildly.</P>
<P>"I thought," &s;aid &s;he, "I thought lord Elmwood had been dead&mdash;are my &s;en&s;es di&s;ordered &s;till?"</P>
<P>"No, my dear," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley, "it is the pre&s;ent lord Elm|wood who wi&s;hes to &s;ee you; he whom you left ill when you came hither, <HI>is</HI> dead."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">"And who is the pre&s;ent lord Elm|wood?" She a&s;ked.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley after a &s;hort he&s;ita|tion replied&mdash;"Your guardian."</P>
<P>"And &s;o he is," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "he is the next heir&mdash;I had forgot.&mdash; But is it po&s;&s;ible he is here?"</P>
<P>"Yes&mdash;" returned Mi&s;s Woodley with a grave voice and manner, to moderate that glow of &s;atisfaction which for a moment &s;parkled even in her languid eye, and blu&s;hed over her pallid coun|tenance&mdash;"Yes&mdash;as he heard you were ill, he thought it right to come and &s;ee you."</P>
<P>"He is very good." An&s;wered &s;he, and the tears &s;tarted in her eyes.</P>
<P>"Would you plea&s;e to admit his Lord&s;hip?" A&s;ked her woman.</P>
<P>"Not yet, not yet," &s;he replied, "let me recollect my&s;elf fir&s;t." And
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;he looked with a timid doubt upon her friend, to a&s;k if it was proper.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley could &s;carce &s;upport this humble reference to her judgment from the wan face of the poor invalid, and taking her by the hand, whi&s;pered in tears, "You &s;hall do what you plea&s;e."&mdash;In a few minutes lord Elm|wood was introduced.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who &s;incerely love, every change of &s;ituation or circum&s;tances in the object beloved, appears an advan|tage.&mdash;So, the acqui&s;ition of a title and e&s;tate, was in Mi&s;s Milner's eye an im|mea&s;urable advantage to her guardian, not on the &s;core of their real value, but any change in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing her pa&s;&s;ion would have &s;erved but to en|crea&s;e it&mdash;even a change to the utmo&s;t poverty.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">When he entered&mdash;the &s;ight of him &s;eemed to be too much for her, and after the fir&s;t glance &s;he turned her head away&mdash;the &s;ound of his voice encou|raged her, however, to look once more&mdash; and now &s;he rivited her eyes upon him.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible, my dear Mi&s;s Mil|ner," he gently whi&s;pered, "to &s;ay, the joy I feel that your di&s;order has &s;ub|&s;ided."</P>
<P>But though it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, it was po&s;&s;ible to <HI>look</HI> what he felt, and his looks expre&s;&s;ed his feelings.&mdash;In the zeal of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, he laid hold of her hand, and held it between his&mdash;this he him&s;elf did not know&mdash;but &s;he did.</P>
<P>"You have prayed for me, my lord, I dare &s;ay?" Said &s;he, with a &s;mile of thanks for tho&s;e prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">"Fervently, ardently!"&mdash;Returned he, and the fervency with which he prayed, &s;poke in every feature.</P>
<P>"But I am a prote&s;tant, my lord, and if I had died &s;uch, do you believe I &s;hould have gone to Heaven?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, that would not have prevented you."</P>
<P>"But Mr. Sandford does not think &s;o."</P>
<P>"He mu&s;t; for he means to go there him&s;elf."</P>
<P>To keep her guardian with her, Mi&s;s Milner &s;eemed inclined to conver&s;e; but Mi&s;s Woodley perceived the temporal as well as the &s;piritual evil of this, and ad|vi&s;ed his lord&s;hip to retire.</P>
<P>They had only one more interview before he left the place; at which Mi&s;s Milner was capable of &s;itting up&mdash;he
<PB N="15" REF="16">
was with her, however, but a very &s;hort time, &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary concerns relative to the late lord Elmwood's affairs, cal|ling him in ha&s;te to London. Mi&s;s Woodley continued with her friend till &s;he &s;aw her entirely rein&s;tated in her health: during which time his lord|&s;hip was frequently the &s;ubject of their private conver&s;ation; and upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions Mi&s;s Milner has &s;ometimes brought Mi&s;s Woodley to acknowledge, "That could Mr. Dorriforth have fore&s;een the early death of the late lord Elmwood, it had been for the greater honour of his religion (con&s;idering that ancient title would now after him be|come extinct), had he preferred mar|riage vows, to tho&s;e of celibacy."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the time for Mi&s;s Woodley to depart arrived, Mi&s;s Milner entreated earne&s;tly to accompany her home, and made the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es that &s;he would guard not only her behavi|our, but her very thoughts within the limitation her friend &s;hould pre&s;cribe. Mi&s;s Woodley at length yielded thus much, "That as &s;oon as lord Elm|wood was &s;et out on his journey to Italy, where &s;he had heard him &s;ay he &s;hould &s;hortly be obliged to go, &s;he would no longer deny her the plea&s;ure of returning; and if (after the long ab|&s;ence which mu&s;t con&s;equently take place between him and her) &s;he &s;hould then, po&s;itively affirm the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="17" REF="18">
her pa&s;&s;ion was the happy re&s;ult, &s;he would at that time take her word, and ri&s;k the danger of their once more re|&s;iding together."</P>
<P>With this conce&s;&s;ion on the &s;ide of Mi&s;s Woodley they parted; and as winter was now far advanced, that lady returned to her aunt's hou&s;e in town, from whence Mrs. Horton was, how|ever, preparing to remove, in order to &s;uperintend lord Elmwood's hou&s;e, (which had been occupied by the late earl,) in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare; and Mi&s;s Woodley was to accompany her.</P>
<P>If lord Elmwood was not de&s;irous Mi&s;s Milner &s;hould conclude her vi&s;it and return to his protection, it was partly from the multiplicity of affairs in which
<PB N="18" REF="19">
he was at this time engaged, and partly from having Mr. Sandford now entirely placed with him as his chaplain; for he dreaded that living in the &s;ame hou&s;e their natural antipathy might be encrea&s;ed to aver&s;ion&mdash;upon this ac|count he once thought of advi&s;ing Mr. Sandford to take up his abode el&s;e|where; but the great plea&s;ure his lord|&s;hip took in his &s;ociety, joined to the great mortification he knew &s;uch a pro|po&s;al would be to his friend, would not &s;uffer him to make it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner all this time was not thinking upon tho&s;e &s;he hated, but on tho&s;e &s;he loved.&mdash;Sandford never came into her thoughts, while the image of lord Elmwood never left them. One morning, as &s;he &s;at talking to lady Luneham on various &s;ubjects, but
<PB N="19" REF="20">
thinking alone on him; Sir Harry, with another gentleman, a Mr. Fleetmond, came in, and the conver&s;ation turned upon the great improbability there was, during the pre&s;ent lord Elmwood's youth, that he &s;hould ever inherit the title and e&s;tate that had now fallen to him&mdash;and &s;aid Mr. Fleetmond, "Inde|pendent of the fortune, it mu&s;t be mat|ter of infinite joy to Dorriforth."&mdash; "No," an&s;wered Sir Harry, "inde|pendent of the fortune, it mu&s;t be a motive of concern to him; for he mu&s;t now regret, beyond mea&s;ure, his folly in taking prie&s;t's orders&mdash;thus depriving him&s;elf of the hopes of an heir, by which the title, at his death, will be lo&s;t."</P>
<P>"By no means," replied Mr. Fleet|mond, "he may yet have an heir, for he will certainly marry."</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">"Marry!" Cried Sir Harry.</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered the other, "it was that I meant by the joy it might proba|bly give him, beyond the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate and title."</P>
<P>"How be married?" &s;aid lady Lune|ham, "Has he not taken a vow never to marry?"</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Mr. Fleetmond, "but there are no religious vows, from which the great Pontiff of Rome can|not grant a di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;tho&s;e com|mandments made by the church, the church has always the power to di&s;pen&s;e withal; and when it is for the general good of religion, his holine&s;s thinks it incumbent on him, to publi&s;h his bull to remit all pains and penalties for their non-ob&s;ervance; and certainly it is for the honour of the catholics, that this earldom &s;hould continue in a ca|tholic
<PB N="21" REF="22">
family&mdash;In &s;hort, I'll lay a wa|ger my lord Elmwood is married within the twelvemonth."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, who li&s;tened with at|tention, feared &s;he was in a dream, or deceived by the pretended knowledge of Mr. Fleetmond, who might know no|thing&mdash;but on con&s;ideration, all that he had &s;aid was very probable; and to confirm its truth, he was him&s;elf a Roman Catholic, and mu&s;t be well in|formed on the &s;ubject upon which he &s;poke.&mdash;If &s;he had heard the dire&s;t news that ever &s;ounded in the ears of the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of mortals, the agitation of her mind and per&s;on could not have been &s;tronger&mdash;&s;he felt, while every word was &s;peaking, a chill through all her veins&mdash;it was a plea&s;ure too ex|qui&s;ite, not to bear along with it the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
&s;en&s;ation of exqui&s;ite pain; of which &s;he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that for a few mo|ments it cau&s;ed her to wi&s;h &s;he had not heard the intelligence; though, very &s;oon after, &s;he would not but have heard it for the world.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had recovered from her fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and joy, &s;he wrote to Mi&s;s Woodley an exact account of what &s;he had heard, and received this an&s;wer.</P>
<Q><P>I am &s;orry any body &s;hould have given you this piece of information, becau&s;e it was a ta&s;k, in the executing of which, I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf the mo&s;t extreme &s;atisfaction&mdash;but the fear your health was not &s;ufficiently return|ed to &s;upport, without danger, the burthen of hopes which I knew would,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
upon this occa&s;ion, pre&s;s upon you, I deferred my plea&s;ing communication, and have had it anticipated. Yet, as you &s;eem in the utmo&s;t doubt as to the truth of what you have been told, perhaps this confirmation of it, may fall little &s;hort of the fir&s;t news; e&s;|pecially when it is &s;trengthened by my entreating you to come to us, as &s;oon as you can with propriety leave lady Luneham.</P>
<P>Come, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, and find in your once rigid monitor, a faitful confident &mdash; I will no longer threaten to di&s;clo&s;e a &s;ecret you have tru&s;ted me with, but leave it to the wi&s;dom and &s;en&s;ibility of his heart, (who is now to penetrate into the hearts of our &s;ex, in &s;earch of one con&s;onant to his own) to find it out.&mdash;I no longer condemn, but congratulate you on
<PB N="24" REF="25">
your pa&s;&s;ion; and will a&s;&s;i&s;t you with all my advice and earne&s;t wi&s;hes, that you may obtain a return.</P></Q>
<P>This letter was another of tho&s;e ex|cruciating plea&s;ures, that nearly reduced Mi&s;s Milner to the grave&mdash;it took away from her all appetite to food, and from her eyes the power of being clo&s;ed for &s;everal nights&mdash;&s;he thought &s;o much upon the pro&s;pect of accompli&s;hing her wi&s;hes, that &s;he could think of nothing be&s;ide; not even invent a probable excu&s;e for leaving lady Luneham be|fore the appointed time, which was yet two months to come. She wrote to Mi&s;s Woodley to beg her contrivance, to reproach her for keeping the &s;ecret &s;o long from her, and to thank her for having revealed it to her in &s;o kind a manner at la&s;t.&mdash;She begged al&s;o to be
<PB N="25" REF="26">
acquainted how Mr. Dorriforth (for &s;till &s;he called him by that name) &s;poke and thought of this &s;udden change in his de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley's reply was a &s;um|mons for her to town upon &s;ome pre|tended bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;he avoided ex|plaining, but which entirely &s;ilenced her lady&s;hip's entreaties for her &s;tay.</P>
<P>To her que&s;tion concerning lord Elmwood &s;he an&s;wered, "It is a &s;ub|ject on which he &s;eldom &s;peaks&mdash;he ap|pears ju&s;t the &s;ame he ever did, nor could you by any part of his conduct, conceive that any &s;uch change had taken place." Mi&s;s Milner exclaimed to her&s;elf, "I am glad he is not al|tered &mdash;if his words, looks, or manners were any thing different from what they formerly were, I &s;hould not like him &s;o well." And ju&s;t the rever&s;e would have
<PB N="26" REF="27">
been the ca&s;e, had Mi&s;s Woodley &s;ent her word he was changed. The day for her leaving Bath was fixed; &s;he ex|pected it with rapture, but before its arrival &s;unk under the care of expecta|tion; and when it came, was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed as to be forced to defer her journey for a week.</P>
<P>At length &s;he found her&s;elf in Lon|don&mdash;in the hou&s;e of her guardian&mdash;and that guardian no longer bound to a &s;ingle life, but <HI>enjoined</HI> to marry. He appeared in her eyes, as in Mi&s;s Wood|ley's, the &s;ame as ever; or perhaps more endearing than ever, as it was the fir&s;t time &s;he had beheld him with hope. &mdash;Mr. Sandford did <HI>not</HI> appear the &s;ame; yet he was in reality as &s;urly and as di&s;re&s;pectful in his behaviour to her as u&s;ual; but &s;he did not ob&s;erve, or
<PB N="27" REF="28">
&s;he did not feel his moro&s;e temper as heretofore&mdash;he &s;eemed amiable, mild, and gentle; at lea&s;t &s;uch was the happy medium through which &s;he &s;aw him now; for good humour, like the jaun|dice, makes every one of its own com|plexion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Elmwood was preparing to go abroad to receive in form, the di&s;|pen&s;ation from his vows; it was, how|ever, a &s;ubject he &s;eemed carefully to avoid &s;peaking upon; and when by any accident he was obliged to mention it, it was without any marks either of &s;a|tisfaction or concern.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner's pride, for the fir&s;t time, began to take the alarm&mdash;while he was Mr. Dorriforth, and confined to a &s;ingle life, his indifference to her charms was rather an honourable, than a re|proachful trait in his character, and in reality &s;he admired him for the in&s;en&s;i|bility &mdash;but on the eve of being at li|berty,
<PB N="29" REF="30">
and on the eve of making his choice, &s;he was offended that choice was not immediately fixed upon her&mdash; She had been accu&s;tomed to receive the devotion of every man who &s;aw her, and not to obtain it of the man from whom, of all others, &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed it, was cruelly humiliating.&mdash;She com|plained to Mi&s;s Woodley, who advi&s;ed her to have patience, but that was one of the virtues in which &s;he was the lea&s;t practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Encouraged, neverthele&s;s, by her friend in the commendable de&s;ire of gaining the affections of him, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all her's, &s;he, however, left no means unat|tempted to make the conque&s;t&mdash;but &s;he began with too great certainty of &s;uc|ce&s;s, not to be &s;en&s;ible of the deepe&s;t mortification in the di&s;appointment&mdash;
<PB N="30" REF="31">
nay, &s;he anticipated a di&s;appointment, as &s;he had before anticipated her &s;uc|ce&s;s, and by turns felt the keene&s;t emo|tions from hope and from de&s;pair.</P>
<P>As the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions alternately govern|ed her, &s;he was alternately in &s;pirits or dejected; in good or in ill humour; and the frequent vici&s;&s;itudes of her pro&s;|pects, at length gave to her behaviour an air of capriciou&s;ne&s;s, which not all her follies had till now produced.&mdash; This was not the way to &s;ecure the af|fections of lord Elmwood; &s;he knew it was not; and before him &s;he was under &s;ome re&s;triction. &mdash; Sandford ob&s;erved this, and added to her many other fail|ings, hypocri&s;y. It was plain to &s;ee Mr. Sandford e&s;teemed her le&s;s and le&s;s every day; and as he was the per&s;on who mo&s;t of all influenced the opinion
<PB N="31" REF="32">
of her guardian, he became to her, very &s;oon, an object not merely of di&s;like, but of abhorrence.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments for each other, were di&s;coverable in every word and action while they were in each others com|pany; but &s;till in his ab&s;ence, Mi&s;s Milner's good nature, and little malice, never &s;uffered her to utter a &s;entence injurious to his intere&s;t. &mdash; Sandford's charity did not extend thus far; and &s;peaking of her with &s;everity one even|ing while &s;he was at the opera, "His meaning," as he &s;aid, "but to caution her guardian again&s;t her faults." Lord Elmwood replied,</P>
<P>"There is one fault, however, Mr. Sandford, I cannot lay to her charge."</P>
<P>"And what is that, my lord?" (cried Sandford, eagerly) "What is that one fault, which Mi&s;s Milner has not?"</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">"I never," replied his lord&s;hip, "heard Mi&s;s Milner, in your ab&s;ence, utter a &s;yllable to your di&s;advantage."</P>
<P>"She dur&s;t not, my lord, becau&s;e &s;he is in fear of you; and &s;he knows you would not &s;uffer it."</P>
<P>"She then," an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "pays me a much higher compliment than you do; for you freely cen&s;ure her, and yet imagine I will &s;uffer it."</P>
<P>"My lord," replied Sandford, "I am undeceived now, and &s;hall never take that liberty again."</P>
<P>As his lord&s;hip always treated Sand|ford with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, he began to fear he had been deficient upon this occa&s;ion; and the di&s;po&s;ition which had induced him to take his ward's part, was likely, in the end, to prove un|favourable to her; for perceiving Sand|ford
<PB N="33" REF="34">
was offended at what had pa&s;&s;ed, as the only means of retribution, his lord&s;hip began him&s;elf to lament her volatile and captious propen&s;ities; in which lamentation Sandford, now for|getting his affront, joined with the heartie&s;t concurrence, adding,</P>
<P>"That you Sir having now other cares to employ your thoughts, ought to in&s;i&s;t upon her marrying, or her retiring wholly into the country."</P>
<P>She returned home ju&s;t as this con|ver&s;ation was fini&s;hed, and Sandford the moment &s;he entered rung for his candle to retire. Mi&s;s Woodley, who had been at the opera with Mi&s;s Mil|ner, cried,</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, Mr. Sandford, are you not well; you are going to leave us &s;o early?"</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">He replied, "No, I have a pain in my head."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, who never heard com|plaints without &s;ympathy, ro&s;e imme|diately from her &s;eat, &s;aying,</P>
<P>"I think I never heard you, Mr. Sandford, complain of indi&s;po&s;ition be|fore&mdash;will you accept of my &s;pecifick for the head-ach? indeed it is a certain relief &mdash; I'll fetch it in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>She went ha&s;tily out of the room, and returned with a bottle, which, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, "was a pre&s;ent from lady Lune|ham, and would certainly cure him." &mdash;And &s;he pre&s;&s;ed it upon him with &s;uch an anxious earne&s;tne&s;s, that with all his churli&s;hne&s;s he could not refu&s;e taking it.</P>
<P>This was but a common-place ci|vility, &s;uch as is paid by one enemy to another every day; but the <HI>man|ner</HI> was the material part &mdash; the un|affected
<PB N="35" REF="36">
concern, the attention, the good will, &s;he demon&s;trated in this lit|tle incident, was that which was remark|able; and which immediately took from lord Elmwood the di&s;plea&s;ure to which he had been ju&s;t before excited, or ra|ther transformed it into a degree of ad|miration. Even Sandford was not in|&s;en&s;ible to her behaviour, and in re|turn, when he left the room, "wi&s;hed her a good night."</P>
<P>To her and to Mi&s;s Woodley, who had not been witne&s;&s;es of the preceding conver&s;ation, what &s;he had done ap|peared of no merit, but to the mind of lord Elmwood it had much; and upon the departure of Sandford he began to be unu&s;ually cheerful. He fir&s;t, re|proached the ladies for not offering him a place in their box at the opera.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">"Would you have gone, my lord?" A&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner, highly delighted.</P>
<P>"Certainly," returned he, "had you invited me."</P>
<P>"Then from this day, my lord, I give you a general invitation: nor &s;hall any other company be admitted, but what you approve."</P>
<P>"I am very much obliged to you." An&s;wered his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"And you," continued &s;he, "who have been only accu&s;tomed to church-mu&s;ick, will be more than any one, enchanted on hearing the &s;oft, harmoni|ous &s;ounds of love."</P>
<P>"What ravi&s;hing plea&s;ures are you preparing for me!" returned he, "I know not whether my weak &s;en&s;es will be able to &s;upport them."</P>
<P>She had her eyes upon him as he &s;poke this, and di&s;covered in his, which
<PB N="37" REF="38">
were fixed upon her, a &s;en&s;ibility unex|pected&mdash;a kind of fa&s;cination, which enticed her to look on, while her eye|lids fell involuntarily before its mighty force; and a thou&s;and blu&s;hes crowded over her face.&mdash;He was &s;truck with the&s;e &s;udden &s;ignals; ha&s;tily recalled his former countenance, and &s;topt the con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, who had been a &s;ilent ob&s;erver for &s;ome time, now thought a word or two from her, would be accept|able rather than trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>"And pray, my lord," &s;aid &s;he, when do you go to France?"</P>
<P>"To Italy you mean,"&mdash;&s;aid he, "not at all&mdash;my &s;uperiors are very indulgent, for they di&s;pen&s;e with all my duties.&mdash;I ought, and meant, to have gone abroad; but as variety of concerns require my
<PB N="38" REF="39">
pre&s;ence in England, every nece&s;&s;ary ce|remony has taken place here."</P>
<P>"Then your lord&s;hip is no longer in orders?" Said Mi&s;s Woodley."</P>
<P>"No, they have been re&s;igned the&s;e five days."</P>
<P>"My lord, I give you joy." Said Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>He thanked her, but added with a &s;igh, "If I have given up content in &s;earch of joy, I &s;hall probably be a lo&s;er by the venture."&mdash;Soon after this, he wi&s;hed the ladies good night, and re|tired.</P>
<P>Happy as Mi&s;s Milner found her&s;elf in his company, &s;he &s;aw him leave the room with infinite &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e her heart was impatient to give a loo&s;e to its hopes on the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s Woodley. &mdash; She bid Mrs. Horton
<PB N="39" REF="40">
immediately good night, and in her friend's apartment gave way to all the language of the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, warm with the confidence of meeting its return.&mdash;She de&s;cribed the &s;entiments &s;he had read in lord Elmwood's looks, and though Mi&s;s Woodley had be|held them too, Mi&s;s Milner's fancy heightened every glance; and her con|&s;truction became, by degrees, &s;o ex|tremely favourable to her own wi&s;hes, that had not her friend been pre&s;ent, and known in what mea&s;ure to e&s;timate tho&s;e &s;ymptoms; &s;he mu&s;t infalliably have thought, by the joy to which they gave birth, his lord&s;hip had openly avowed a pa&s;&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, therefore, thought it her duty to allay tho&s;e extacies, and re|pre&s;ented to her, &s;he might be deceived
<PB N="40" REF="41">
in her hopes&mdash;or even &s;uppo&s;ing his lord&s;hip's inclinations tended towards her, there were yet great ob&s;tacles be|tween them.&mdash;"Would Sandford, who governed, or at lea&s;t directed his al|mo&s;t every thought and purpo&s;e, not be con&s;ulted upon this? and if he was; on what, but the mo&s;t romantic affection on the part of lord Elmwood, had Mi&s;s Milner to depend? and his lord&s;hip was not a man to be &s;u&s;pected of &s;ubmitting to the exce&s;s of any pa&s;&s;ion."&mdash;Thus did Mi&s;s Woodley argue, for fear her friend &s;hould be mi&s;led by her wi&s;hes, yet in her own mind &s;he &s;carce har|boured a doubt that any thing would thwart them.&mdash;The &s;ucceeding circum|&s;tance proved &s;he was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Another gentleman of family and fortune made overtures to Mi&s;s Milner;
<PB N="41" REF="42">
and her guardian, &s;o far from having his thoughts inclined towards her on his own account, pleaded this lover's cau&s;e even with more zeal, than he had for|merly pleaded for Sir Edward and lord Frederick; and thus at once de&s;troyed all tho&s;e plans of happine&s;s poor Mi&s;s Milner had meditated.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, her melancholy hu|mour was now predominant; and for &s;everal days &s;he &s;taid entirely at home, and yet was denied to all her vi&s;itants. &mdash;Whether this aro&s;e from pure melan|choly, or the &s;till lingering hope of making her conque&s;t, by that &s;edatene&s;s of manners &s;he knew her guardian ad|mired, perhaps &s;he her&s;elf did not know. &mdash;Be that as it may, lord Elmwood could not but ob&s;erve this change, and
<PB N="42" REF="43">
one morning thought fit to mention, and applaud it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were working together when he came into the room; and after &s;itting &s;everal minutes, and talking upon indifferent &s;ubjects; to which his ward replied with a dejection in her voice and manner&mdash;he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Perhaps I am wrong, Mi&s;s Mil|ner, but I have ob&s;erved you are lately grown more thoughtful than u&s;ual."</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed, as &s;he always did when the &s;ubject was her&s;elf.&mdash;He continued, "Your health appears perfectly re&s;tor|ed, and yet you do not take delight in your former recreations."</P>
<P>"Are you &s;orry for that, my lord?"</P>
<P>"No, madam, I am extremely glad; and I was going to congratulate you upon the change&mdash;but give me leave to
<PB N="43" REF="44">
enquire, to what lucky accident we are to attribute this alteration?"</P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip then thinks all my commendable deeds, ari&s;e from acci|dent; and that I have no virtues of my own."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Mi&s;s Milner, I think you have many." This he &s;poke em|phatically; and the blood flowed to her face more than at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>He re&s;umed&mdash;"How can I doubt of a lady's virtues, when her countenance gives &s;uch evident proofs of them?&mdash;be|lieve me, Mi&s;s Milner, that in the mid&s;t of your gaye&s;t follies; while you thus continue to blu&s;h, I &s;hall reverence your internal &s;en&s;ations."</P>
<P>"Oh! my lord, did you know &s;ome of them, I am afraid you would think them unpardonable."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">This was &s;o much to the purpo&s;e, Mi&s;s Woodley found her&s;elf unea&s;y&mdash;but &s;he needed not&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner loved too &s;incerely, to reveal it to the object.&mdash; His lord&s;hip an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"And did you, Mi&s;s Milner, know &s;ome of mine, you might think them equally unpardonable."</P>
<P>She turned pale, and could no longer guide her needle&mdash;in the fond tran&s;|ports of her heart &s;he imagined, the &s;en&s;ations to which he alluded, was his love for her.&mdash;She was too much em|barra&s;&s;ed to reply, and he continued,</P>
<P>"We have all a great deal to pardon in one another; and I know not whe|ther the officious per&s;on who forces, even his good advice, is not as blame|able as the ob&s;tinate one, who will not li&s;ten to it.&mdash;And now, having made a preface to excu&s;e you, &s;hould you once
<PB N="45" REF="46">
more refu&s;e mine, I will venture to give it."</P>
<P>"My lord," returned &s;he, "I have never yet refu&s;ed to follow your advice, but where my own peace of mind was &s;o nearly concerned, as to have made me culpable, had I complied."</P>
<P>"Well, madam, I &s;ubmit to your determinations; and &s;hall never again oppo&s;e your inclination to remain &s;in|gle."</P>
<P>This &s;entence, as it excluded his ever &s;oliciting for him&s;elf, gave her the ut|mo&s;t pain; and &s;he ca&s;t a glance of her eye at him full of reproach. &mdash; He did not ob&s;erve it, but went on.</P>
<P>"Continuing unmarried, it &s;eems to have been your father's intention, you &s;hould continue under my immediate care; but as I mean for the future to re|&s;ide chiefly in the country&mdash;an&s;wer me
<PB N="46" REF="47">
candidly, do you think you could be happy there, for at lea&s;t three parts of the year?"</P>
<P>"After a &s;hort he&s;itation, &s;he replied, &mdash;"I have no objection."</P>
<P>"I am glad to hear it," he returned eagerly, "for it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire to have you with me&mdash;your welfare is dear to me as my own; and were we apart, continual apprehen&s;ions would prey upon my mind."</P>
<P>The tear &s;tarted in her eye, at the earne&s;tne&s;s with which this was &s;poken; &mdash;he &s;aw it, and to &s;often her &s;till more with the &s;en&s;e of his e&s;teem for her, he encrea&s;ed his earne&s;tne&s;s while he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"If you will take the re&s;olution to quit London for the time I mention, there &s;hall be no means unemployed to make the country all you can wi&s;h&mdash;I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon Mi&s;s Woodley's ac|companying
<PB N="47" REF="48">
you; and it will not only be <HI>my</HI> &s;tudy to form &s;uch a &s;ociety as you may approve, but I am certain it will be likewi&s;e the &s;tudy of lady Elm|wood&mdash;"</P>
<P>He was going on, but as if a poniard had thru&s;t her heart, &s;he writhed under this unexpected &s;troke.</P>
<P>He &s;aw her countenance change &mdash; he looked at her &s;teadfa&s;tly.</P>
<P>It was not a common change from joy to &s;orrow, from content to unea&s;i|ne&s;s, which Mi&s;s Milner di&s;covered&mdash;&s;he felt, and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed angui&s;h.&mdash;Lord Elmwood was alarmed and &s;hocked. &mdash; She did not weep, but &s;he called Mi&s;s Woodley to come to her, with a voice that indicated a degree of agony.</P>
<P>"My lord," (cried Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;eeing his con&s;ternation, and trembling le&s;t he &s;hould gue&s;s the &s;ecret), "My
<PB N="48" REF="49">
lord, Mi&s;s Milner has again deceived you&mdash;you mu&s;t not take her from Lon|don&mdash;it is that, which is the cau&s;e of her unea&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>He &s;eemed more amazed &s;till, and &s;till more &s;hocked at her duplicity than at her torture.&mdash;"Good Heaven," ex|claimed he, "how am I to accompli&s;h her wi&s;hes? what am I to do? how can I judge, while &s;he will not confide in me, but thus gro&s;sly deceives me?"</P>
<P>She leaned, pale as death, on the &s;houlder of Mi&s;s Woodley, her eyes fixed, with a &s;eeming in&s;en&s;ibility to all that was &s;aid, while he continued,</P>
<P>"Heaven is my witne&s;s, if I knew&mdash; if I could conceive the means how to make her happy, I would &s;acrifice my own happine&s;s to her's."</P>
<P>"My lord," cried Mi&s;s Woodley with a &s;mile, "perhaps I may call upon you hereafter, to fulfil your word."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">He was totally ignorant what &s;he meant, nor had he lei&s;ure from the confu&s;ion of his thoughts to reflect upon her meaning; he neverthele&s;s re|plied, with warmth, "Do&mdash;you will find I'll perform it.&mdash;Do&mdash;I will faithfully perform it."</P>
<P>Though Mi&s;s Milner was con&s;cious this declaration could not, in delicacy, ever be brought again&s;t him; yet the fervent and &s;olemn manner in which he made it, cheered her &s;pirits; and as per&s;ons enjoy the reflection of having in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ome valuable gem, although they are determined never to u&s;e it, &s;o &s;he upon this, was comforted and grew better.&mdash;She now lifted up her head from Mi&s;s Woodley, and leaned it on her hand as &s;he &s;at by the &s;ide of a table&mdash;&s;till &s;he did not &s;peak, but &s;eemed overcome with &s;orrow.&mdash;
<PB N="50" REF="51">
As her &s;ituation became, however, le&s;s alarming; her guardian's pity and af|fright began to take the colour of re|&s;entment; and though he did not &s;ay &s;o, he was, and looked highly offended.</P>
<P>At this juncture Mr. Sandford en|tered.&mdash;On beholding the pre&s;ent party, it needed not his &s;agacity to &s;ee, at the fir&s;t view, they were all unea&s;y; but in|&s;tead of the &s;ympathy this might have excited in &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions, Mr. Sand|ford, after ca&s;ting a look at each of them, appeared in high &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"You &s;eem unhappy, my lord." Said he, with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>"You do <HI>not</HI>&mdash;Mr. Sandford." Re|plied his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"No, my lord, nor would I, were I in your &s;ituation,"&mdash;returned he, "What &s;hould make a man of &s;en&s;e out of tem|per
<PB N="51" REF="52">
but a worthy object?"&mdash;And he looked at Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"There are no objects unworthy our care." Replied lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"But there are objects on whom all care is fruitle&s;s, your lord&s;hip will al|low."</P>
<P>"I never yet de&s;paired of any one, Mr. Sandford."</P>
<P>"And yet there are per&s;ons, of whom it is pre&s;umption, to entertain hopes." &mdash; And he looked again at Mi&s;s Mil|ner.</P>
<P>"Does your head ach, Mi&s;s Mil|ner?" A&s;ked Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;eeing her hold it with her hand.</P>
<P>"Very much." Returned &s;he.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," &s;aid Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "Did you u&s;e all tho&s;e drops Mi&s;s Milner gave you for a pain in the head?"</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">"Yes," an&s;wered he, "I did."&mdash; But the que&s;tion at that moment &s;ome|what embarra&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>"And I hope you found benefit from them." Said Mi&s;s Milner, with great kindne&s;s, as &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and walked &s;lowly and de&s;pondently out of the room.</P>
<P>Though Mi&s;s Woodley followed her, &s;o that Mr. Sandford was left alone with lord Elmwood, and might have conti|nued his unkind in&s;inuations without one re&s;traint; yet his lips were clo&s;ed for the pre&s;ent.&mdash;He looked down on the carpet&mdash;twitched him&s;elf upon his chair &mdash;and began to talk of the weather.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of de|&s;pair were over, Mi&s;s Milner &s;uffered her&s;elf to be once more in hope&mdash;&s;he found there were no other means to &s;upport her life; and to her no &s;mall joy, her friend, Mi&s;s Woodley, was much le&s;s &s;evere on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion than &s;he expected.&mdash;No engagement between mortals, was, in Mi&s;s Woodley's opinion, binding like that entered into with hea|ven; and whatever vows lord Elmwood had made to another, &s;he ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;|ed, no woman's love for him, equalled Mi&s;s Milner's&mdash;it was prior to all others too, and that e&s;tabli&s;hed a claim, at lea&s;t to contend for &s;ucce&s;s; and in a
<PB N="54" REF="55">
contention, what rival would not fall before her?</P>
<P>It was not difficult to gue&s;s who this rival was; or if they were a little time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, Mi&s;s Woodley &s;oon ar|rived at the certainty, by inquiring of Mr. Sandford; who, un&s;u&s;picious why &s;he a&s;ked, readily informed her the in|tended lady Elmwood, was no other than Mi&s;s Fenton; and that her marriage with his lord&s;hip would be &s;olemnized as &s;oon as the mourning for the late lord Elmwood was expired.&mdash;This la&s;t in|telligence made Mi&s;s Woodley &s;hud|der&mdash;however, &s;he repeated it to Mi&s;s Milner, word for word.</P>
<P>"Happy! happy, woman!" exclaim|ed Mi&s;s Milner of Mi&s;s Fenton; "&s;he has received the fir&s;t fond impul&s;es of his heart, and has had the tran&s;cen|dent
<PB N="55" REF="56">
happine&s;s of teaching him to love!"</P>
<P>"By no means," returned Mi&s;s Woodley, finding there was no other method to comfort her; "do not &s;up|po&s;e lord Elmwood's marriage is the re&s;ult of love&mdash;it is no more than a duty, a nece&s;&s;ary piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, and this you may plainly &s;ee by the wife on whom he has fixed.&mdash;Mi&s;s Fenton was thought a proper match for his cou&s;in, and this &s;ame propriety, you mu&s;t per|ceive &s;till exi&s;ts."</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to convince Mi&s;s Milner all her friend &s;aid was truth, for &s;he wi&s;hed it to be &s;o. "And oh!" &s;he exclaimed, "could I but &s;timulate pa&s;&s;ion, in the place of propriety &mdash;do you think my dear Mi&s;s Woodley," (and &s;he looked with &s;uch begging eyes, it was impo&s;&s;ible not to an&s;wer as &s;he wi&s;hed,) "do you

<P>Mi&s;s Woodley pau&s;ed a minute, and then an&s;wered, "No;"&mdash;but there was a he&s;itation in her manner of delivery&mdash; &s;he did &s;ay, "No," but &s;he looked as if &s;he was afraid &s;he ought to have &s;aid "Yes."&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner, however, did not wait to give her time to recall the word, or to alter its meaning by adding others to it, but run on eagerly, and declared, "As that was her opinion, &s;he would abide by it, and do all &s;he could to &s;upplant her rival."&mdash;In order, never|thele&s;s, to ju&s;tify this determination, and &s;atisfy the con&s;cience of Mi&s;s Woodley, they both concluded, Mi&s;s Fenton's heart was not engaged in the intended

marriage, and con&s;equently &s;he was in|different whether it took place or not.</P>
<P>Since the death of the late earl, that young lady had not been in town; nor had the pre&s;ent lord been near the &s;pot where &s;he re&s;ided &s;ince the week her lover died; of cour&s;e, nothing like love could be declared at &s;o early a period; and if it had been made known &s;ince, it mu&s;t only have been by letter, or by the deputation of Mr. Sandford, whom they knew had been once in the coun|try to vi&s;it her; but how little he was qualified to enforce a tender pa&s;&s;ion, was a comfortable reflection.</P>
<P>Revived with the&s;e conjectures, of which &s;ome were true, and others fal&s;e; the very next day a dark gloom over|&s;pread their bright pro&s;pects, on Mr.

Sandford's &s;aying, as he entered the breakfa&s;t-room,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fenton, ladies, de&s;ired me to pre&s;ent her compliments to you."</P>
<P>"Is &s;he in town?" A&s;ked Mrs. Hor|ton.</P>
<P>"She came to town ye&s;terday morn|ing," returned Sandford, "and is at her brother's, in Ormond &s;treet; my lord and I &s;upped there la&s;t night, and that made us &s;o late home."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip entered &s;oon after, and confirmed what had been &s;aid, by bow|ing to his ward, and telling her, "Mi&s;s Fenton had charged him with her kinde&s;t re&s;pects."</P>
<P>"How does poor Mi&s;s Fenton look?" Mrs. Horton a&s;ked lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>To which que&s;tion Sandford replied, "Beautiful&mdash;&s;he looks beautifully."</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">"She has got over her unea&s;ine&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e then?" Said Mrs. Horton&mdash;not knowing &s;he was a&s;king the que&s;tion be|fore her new lover.</P>
<P>"Unea&s;y!" replied Sandford, "un|ea&s;y at any trial this world can &s;end? that had been highly unworthy of her."</P>
<P>"But &s;ometimes women do fret at &s;uch things." Replied Mrs. Horton in|nocently.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner&mdash; "If &s;he meant to ride, this charming day?"</P>
<P>While &s;he was he&s;itating&mdash;</P>
<P>"There are very different kind of women," (an&s;wered Sandford, directing his di&s;cour&s;e to Mrs. Horton,) "there is as much difference between &s;ome women, as between good and evil &s;pirits."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">Lord Elmwood a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner again&mdash;if &s;he took an airing?</P>
<P>She replied, "No."</P>
<P>"And beauty," continued Sandford, "when endowed upon &s;pirits that are evil, is a mark of their greater, their more extreme wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Lucifer was the mo&s;t beautiful of all the angels in paradi&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>"How do you know?" Said Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"But the beauty of Lucifer" (con|tinued Sandford, in perfect neglect and contempt of her que&s;tion,) "was an aggravation of his guilt; becau&s;e it &s;hewed a double &s;hare of ingratitude to the Divine Creator of that beauty."</P>
<P>"Now you talk of angels," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "I wi&s;h I had wings; and I &s;hould like to fly through the park this morning."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">"You would be taken for an angel in good earne&s;t." Said lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>Sandford was angry at this little compliment, and cried, "Then in&s;tead of the wings, I would advi&s;e the &s;er|pent's &s;kin."</P>
<P>"My lord," cried &s;he, "does not Mr. Sandford u&s;e me ill?"&mdash;Vext with other things, &s;he felt her&s;elf extremely hurt at this, and made the appeal al|mo&s;t in tears.</P>
<P>"Indeed, I think he does." An|&s;wered his lord&s;hip, and he looked at Sandford as if he was di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was a triumph &s;o agreeable to her, &s;he immediately pardoned the of|fence; but the offender did not &s;o ea&s;ily pardon her.</P>
<P>"Good morning, ladies." Said his lord&s;hip, ri&s;ing to go away.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "you promi&s;ed Mi&s;s Milner to accom|pany
<PB N="62" REF="63">
her one evening to the opera; this is opera night."</P>
<P>"Will you go, my lord?" A&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner, in a voice &s;o &s;oft, he &s;eemed as if he wi&s;hed, but could not re&s;i&s;t it."</P>
<P>"I am to dine at Mr. Fenton's to|day," he replied, "and if he and his &s;i&s;ter will go; and you will allow them part of your box, I will promi&s;e to come."</P>
<P>This was a condition that did not plea&s;e her, but as &s;he felt a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee him in the company of his intended bride, (for &s;he fancied &s;he could perceive his mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;en|timents, could &s;he once &s;ee them to|gether) &s;he an&s;wered not ungraciou&s;ly, "Yes, my compliments to Mr. and Mi&s;s Fenton, and I hope they will fa|vour me with their company."</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">"Then, madam, if they come, you may expect me&mdash;el&s;e not." And he bowed and left the room.</P>
<P>All the day was pa&s;&s;ed in anxious ex|pectation by Mi&s;s Milner, what would be the event of the evening; for upon the &s;kill of her penetration that even|ing, all her future pro&s;pects &s;he thought depended.&mdash;If &s;he &s;aw by his looks, his words, or a&s;&s;iduity, he loved Mi&s;s Fen|ton, &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he would never think of him again with hope; but if &s;he ob&s;erved him treat her with inattention or indifference, &s;he meant to cheri&s;h from that moment the fonde&s;t expectations. &mdash;Again&s;t that &s;hort evening her toilet was con&s;ulted the whole day; and the alternate hope and fear which fluttered at her heart, gave a more than u&s;ual brilliancy to her eyes, and more than
<PB N="64" REF="65">
u&s;ual bloom to her complexion.&mdash;But in vain was her beauty; vain all the pains &s;he had taken to decorate that beauty; vain the many looks &s;he ca&s;t towards her box-door to &s;ee it open; lord Elmwood did not come.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ick was di&s;cord&mdash;every thing &s;he &s;aw, was di&s;gu&s;ting&mdash;in a word, &s;he was mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>She longed impatiently for the cur|tain to drop, becau&s;e &s;he was unea&s;y where &s;he was&mdash;yet &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf, "Shall I be le&s;s unhappy at home? yes, at home I &s;hall &s;ee lord Elmwood, and that will be happine&s;s&mdash;but he will behold me with neglect, and that will be mi&s;ery.&mdash;Ungrateful man! I will no longer think of him." She &s;aid to her&s;elf.&mdash;Or could &s;he have thought
<PB N="65" REF="66">
of him without joining in the &s;ame idea Mi&s;s Fenton, her angui&s;h had been &s;upportable; but while &s;he pictured them as lovers, the tortures of the rack give but a few degrees more pain than &s;he endured.</P>
<P>There are but few per&s;ons who ever felt the real pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y, becau&s;e few have felt the real pa&s;&s;ion of love; but to tho&s;e who have experienced them both, jealou&s;y not only affects the mind, but every fibre of the frame is a victim to it; and Mi&s;s Milner's every limb ached, with agonizing torment, while Mi&s;s Fenton, courted and beloved by lord Elmwood, was pre&s;ent to her ima|gination.</P>
<P>The moment the opera was fini&s;hed, &s;he flew ha&s;tily down &s;tairs, as if to fly
<PB N="66" REF="67">
from the &s;ufferings &s;he experienced.&mdash; She did not go into the coffee-room, though repeatedly per&s;uaded by Mi&s;s Woodley, but waited at the door till her carriage drew up.</P>
<P>Piqued &mdash; heart-broken &mdash; full of re|&s;entment to the object of her unea&s;i|ne&s;s; as &s;he &s;tood inattentive to all that pa&s;&s;ed, a hand gently laid hold of her's, and the mo&s;t humble and in&s;inuating voice &s;aid, "Will you permit me to hand you to your carriage?" She was awaked from her reverie, and found lord Frederick Lawnly by her &s;ide.&mdash; Her heart, ju&s;t then melting with ten|derne&s;s to another, was perhaps more acce&s;&s;ible than heretofore, or bur&s;ting with re&s;entment, thought this the mo|ment to retaliate. Whatever pa&s;&s;ion reigned that in&s;tant, it was favourable
<PB N="67" REF="68">
to the de&s;ires of lord Frederick, and &s;he looked as if &s;he was glad to &s;ee him; he beheld this with the rapture and the humility of a lover; and though &s;he did not feel the &s;lighte&s;t love in return, &s;he felt a gratitude proportionate to the in|&s;en&s;ibility with which &s;he had been treated by her guardian, and lord Fre|derick was not very erroneous if he mi&s;|took this gratitude for a latent &s;park of affection. The mi&s;take, however, did not force from him his re&s;pect: he handed her to her carriage, bowed low|ly, and di&s;appeared. Mi&s;s Woodley wi&s;hed to divert her thoughts from the object which could only make her wretched, and as they rode home, by many encomiums upon lord Frederick, endeavoured to incite her to a regard for him; Mi&s;s Milner was di&s;plea&s;ed at the attempt, and exclaimed,</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">"What, love a rake, a man of pro|fe&s;&s;ed gallantry? impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;To me, a common rake is as odious, as a com|mon pro&s;titute is to a man of the nice&s;t feelings.&mdash;Where can be the pride of in&s;piring a pa&s;&s;ion, fifty others can equally in&s;pire? or the tran&s;port of be|&s;towing favours, where the appetite is already cloyed by fruition of the &s;elf|&s;ame enjoyments?"</P>
<P>"Strange," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "that you, who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o many follies incident to your &s;ex, &s;hould, in the di&s;|po&s;al of your heart, have &s;entiments &s;o contrary to women in general."</P>
<P>"My dear Mi&s;s Woodley," returned &s;he, "put in competition the languid love of a debauchee, with the vivid af|fection of a &s;ober man, and judge which has the dominion? Oh! in my calen|der of love, a &s;olemn lord chief ju&s;tice,
<PB N="69" REF="70">
or a devout archbi&s;hop, ranks before a licentious king."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;miled at an opinion which &s;he knew half her &s;ex would laugh at; but by the air of &s;incerity with which it was delivered, &s;he was con|vinced, her late behaviour to lord Fre|derick was but the mere effect of chance.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood's carriage drove to his door ju&s;t at the time her's did; Mr. Sandford was with him, and they were both come from pa&s;&s;ing the evening at Mr. Fenton's.</P>
<P>"So, my lord," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, as &s;oon as they met in the apartment, "you did not come to us."</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "I was &s;orry; but I hope you did not ex|pect me."</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">"Not expect you, my lord?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "did not you &s;ay you would come?"</P>
<P>"If I had, I certainly &s;hould have come," returned he, "but I only &s;aid &s;o conditionally."</P>
<P>"That I am witne&s;s to," cried Sand|ford, "for I was pre&s;ent at the time, and his lord&s;hip &s;aid it &s;hould depend upon Mi&s;s Fenton."</P>
<P>"And &s;he, with her gloomy di&s;po&s;i|tion," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "cho&s;e to &s;it at home."</P>
<P>"Gloomy di&s;po&s;ition?" repeated Sandford, "She is a young lady with a great &s;hare of &s;prightline&s;s&mdash;and I think I never &s;aw her in better &s;pirits than &s;he was this evening, my lord?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, Mr. Sandford," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I meant no reflection
<PB N="71" REF="72">
upon Mi&s;s Fenton's di&s;po&s;ition; I only meant to cen&s;ure her ta&s;te for &s;taying at home."</P>
<P>"I think," replied Sandford, "a much greater cen&s;ure &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed upon tho&s;e, who prefer rambling a|broad."</P>
<P>"But I hope, ladies, my not com|ing," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, "was no cau&s;e of inconvenience to you; you had &s;till a gentleman with you, or I &s;hould cer|tainly have come."</P>
<P>"Oh! yes, two gentlemen." An|&s;wered the young &s;on of lady Evans, a lad from &s;chool, whom Mi&s;s Milner had taken along with her, and to whom his lord&s;hip had alluded.</P>
<P>"What two?" A&s;ked lord Elm|wood.</P>
<P>Neither Mi&s;s Milner or Mi&s;s Wood|ley an&s;wered.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">"You know, madam," &s;aid young Evans, "that hand&s;ome gentleman who handed you into your carriage, and you called my lord."</P>
<P>"Oh! he means lord Frederick Lawnley." Said Mi&s;s Milner carele&s;sly, but a blu&s;h of &s;hame &s;pread over her face.</P>
<P>"And did he hand you into your coach?" A&s;ked his lord&s;hip, earn|e&s;tly.</P>
<P>"By mere accident, my lord," Mi&s;s Woodley replied, "for the crowd was &s;o great&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I think, my lord," &s;aid Sandford, "it was very lucky you were <HI>not</HI> there."</P>
<P>"Had lord Elmwood been with us, we &s;hould not have had occa&s;ion for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other." Said Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">"Lord Elmwood has been with you, madam," returned Sandford, "very frequently, and yet&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, interrupting him, "it is near bed-time, your conver&s;ation keeps the ladies from retiring."</P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip's does not." Said Mi&s;s Milner, "for you &s;ay nothing."</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e, madam, I am afraid to offend."</P>
<P>"But does not your lord&s;hip al&s;o hope to plea&s;e? and without ri&s;king the one, it is impo&s;&s;ible to arrive at the other."</P>
<P>"I think, at pre&s;ent, the ri&s;k of one would be too hazardous, and &s;o I wi&s;h you a good night." And he went out of the room &s;omewhat abruptly.</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood," &s;aid Mi&s;s Mil|ner, "is very grave&mdash;he does not look
<PB N="74" REF="75">
like a man who has been pa&s;&s;ing his evening with the woman he loves."</P>
<P>"Perhaps he is melancholy at part|ing from her." Said Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"More likely offended," &s;aid Sand|ford, at the manner in which that lady has &s;poken of her."</P>
<P>"Who, I?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I prote&s;t I &s;aid nothing but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nothing, madam? did not you &s;ay &s;he was gloomy?"</P>
<P>"But, what I thought&mdash;I was going to add, Mr. Sandford."</P>
<P>"When you think unju&s;tly, you &s;hould not expre&s;s your thoughts."</P>
<P>"Then, perhaps, I &s;hould never &s;peak."</P>
<P>"And it were better you did not, if what you &s;ay, is to give pain.&mdash;Do you know, madam, that my lord is going to be married to Mi&s;s Fenton?"</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76">"Yes." An&s;wered Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"Do you know that he loves her?"</P>
<P>"No." An&s;wered Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"How, madam! do you &s;uppo&s;e he does not?"</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e he does, yet I don't know it."</P>
<P>"Then &s;uppo&s;ing he does, how can you have the imprudence to find fault with her before him?"</P>
<P>"I did not &mdash; to call her gloomy, was, I knew, to prai&s;e her both to him and to you, who admire &s;uch tem|pers."</P>
<P>"Whatever her temper is, <HI>every one</HI> admires it; and &s;o far from its being what you have de&s;cribed, &s;he has a great deal of vivacity; vivacity which pro|ceeds from the heart."</P>
<P>"No, if it proceeded, I &s;hould ad|mire it too; but it re&s;ts there, and no one is the better for it.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77">"Come, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "it is time to retire; you and Mr. Sandford mu&s;t fini&s;h your di&s;|pute in the morning."</P>
<P>"Di&s;pute, madam!" &s;aid Sandford, "I never di&s;puted with any one be|neath a doctor of divinity in my life.&mdash;I was only cautioning your friend not to make light of virtues, which it would do her honour to po&s;&s;e&s;s. &mdash; Mi&s;s Fen|ton is a mo&s;t amiable young woman, and worthy ju&s;t &s;uch a hu&s;band as my Lord Elmwood will make her."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "Mi&s;s Milner thinks &s;o &mdash; &s;he has a high opinion of Mi&s;s Fenton&mdash;&s;he was at pre&s;ent only je&s;ting."</P>
<P>"But, madam, je&s;ts are very perni|cious things, when delivered with a malignant &s;neer.&mdash;I have known a je&s;t de&s;troy a lady's reputation &mdash; I have
<PB N="77" REF="78">
known a je&s;t give one per&s;on a di&s;ta&s;te for another&mdash;I have known a je&s;t break off a marriage."</P>
<P>"But I &s;uppo&s;e there is no appre|hen&s;ion of that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e?" Said Mi&s;s Woodley&mdash;wi&s;hing he might an&s;wer in the affirmative.</P>
<P>"Not that I can fore&s;ee." Replied he. &mdash;"No, Heaven forbid; for I look upon them to be formed for each other &mdash;their di&s;po&s;itions, their pur&s;uits, their inclinations the &s;ame.&mdash;Their pa&s;&s;ions for each other ju&s;t the &s;ame&mdash;pure&mdash; white as &s;now."</P>
<P>"And I dare &s;ay, not warmer." Re|plied Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>He looked provoked beyond mea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Milner," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "how can you talk thus? I believe in my heart you are only
<PB N="78" REF="79">
envious my lord did not offer him&s;elf to you."</P>
<P>"To her!" &s;aid Sandford, affecting an air of the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, "to her? Do you think his lord&s;hip received a di&s;pen&s;ation from his vows to become the hu&s;band of a coquette&mdash;a&mdash;" he was going on.</P>
<P>"Nay, Mr. Sandford," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I believe my greate&s;t crime in your eyes, is being a heretick."</P>
<P>"By no means, madam&mdash;it is the only circum&s;tance that can apologize for your faults; and had you not that excu&s;e, there would be none for you."</P>
<P>"Then, at pre&s;ent, there is an ex|cu&s;e&mdash;I thank you, Mr. Sandford; this is the kinde&s;t thing you ever &s;aid to me. But I am vext to &s;ee you are &s;orry, you have &s;aid it."</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">"Angry at your being a heretick?" he re&s;umed, "Indeed I &s;hould be much more concerned to &s;ee you a di&s;grace to our religion."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had not been in a good humour during the whole evening&mdash;&s;he had been provoked to the full extent of her patience &s;everal times; but this har&s;h &s;entence hurried her beyond all bounds, and &s;he aro&s;e from her &s;eat in the mo&s;t violent agitation, and exclaimed, "What have I done to be treated thus?"</P>
<P>Though Mr. Sandford was not a man ea&s;ily intimidated, he was on this occa&s;ion evidently alarmed; and &s;tared about him with &s;o &s;trong an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urpri&s;e, that it partook in &s;ome degree of fear.&mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley cla&s;ped her friend in her arms, and cried with the tendere&s;t af|fection
<PB N="80" REF="81">
and pity, "My dear Mi&s;s Mil|ner, be compo&s;ed."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner &s;at down, and was &s;o for a minute; but her dead &s;ilence was nearly as alarming to Sandford as her rage had been; and he did not perfectly recover him&s;elf till he &s;aw a flood of tears pouring down her face; he then heaved a &s;igh of content that it had &s;o ended, but in his heart re&s;olved never to forget the ridiculous affright into which he had been put.&mdash;He &s;tole out of the room without uttering a &s;yllable &mdash;But as he never retired to re&s;t before he had repeated a long form of evening prayers, &s;o when he came to that part which &s;upplicates "Grace for the wicked," he named Mi&s;s Milner's name, with the mo&s;t fervent devotion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many &s;leeple&s;s nights Mi&s;s Milner pa&s;&s;ed, the pre&s;ent was not one of them; it is true &s;he had a weight of care upon her heart, even heavier than u&s;ual, but its burthen had over|come her &s;trength; and wearied out with hopes, with fears, and at the end with di&s;appointment and rage, &s;he &s;unk into a profound &s;lumber as &s;oon as &s;he was laid down&mdash;but the more forget|fulne&s;s had prevailed, the greater was the force of remembrance when &s;he awoke&mdash;At fir&s;t, &s;o &s;ound had her &s;leep been, &s;he had a difficulty in calling to mind why &s;he was unhappy; but that &s;he was unhappy, &s;he well recollected &mdash;and when the cau&s;e came to her me|mory,
<PB N="82" REF="83">
&s;he would have &s;lept again, but that was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Though her re&s;t had been &s;ound, it had not been refre&s;hing; &s;he was far from well, and &s;ent word &s;o as an apo|logy for not being pre&s;ent at breakfa&s;t. Lord Elmwood looked concerned when the me&s;&s;age was delivered; Mr. Sand|ford &s;hook his head.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner's health is not good." Said Mrs. Horton a few minutes after</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood laid down the news|paper to attend to her.</P>
<P>"To me there is &s;omething very ex|traordinary about her." Continued Mrs. Horton, finding &s;he had caught his lord|&s;hip's attention.</P>
<P>"So there is to me." Added Sand|ford, with a &s;arca&s;tick &s;neer.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">"And &s;o there is to me." Said Mi&s;s Woodley, with a mo&s;t &s;erious face, and heartfelt &s;igh.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood gazed by turns at each, as each delivered their &s;entiments &mdash;and when they were all &s;ilent, he looked bewildered, not knowing what judgment to form from any of the&s;e &s;entences.</P>
<P>Soon after breakfa&s;t, Mr. Sandford withdrew to his own apartment; Mrs. Horton in a little time went to her's, and lord Elmwood and Mi&s;s Woodley were left alone.&mdash;His lord&s;hip immedi|ately ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;aid,</P>

<P>"What do you mean by that, Mi&s;s Woodley? you talk my&s;teriou&s;ly.&mdash;Is &s;he not afraid I will thwart her inclina|tions?"</P>
<P>"She is &s;ure you will, my lord."</P>
<P>"Then mu&s;t not the per&s;on be un|worthy of her?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley ro&s;e from her &s;eat, the tears trinkled down her cheeks, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands, and every look, every ge&s;ture proved her alternate re|&s;olution, and irre&s;olution of proceeding farther. &mdash; Lord Elmwood's attention was arre&s;ted before, but now it was fix|ed

to a degree, which her manner could only occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>This &s;olemn preparation made lord Elmwood tremble; and he run over in&s;tantly in his mind all the per&s;ons he could recollect, in order to arrive at the knowledge by thought, quicker than by words.&mdash;It was in vain he tried, and he once more turned his enquiring eyes upon Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;He &s;aw her &s;ilent and covered with confu&s;ion.&mdash;Again he &s;earched his own thoughts, nor inef|fectually as before.&mdash;At the fir&s;t glance

the object was pre&s;ented, and he beheld <HI>him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>The rapid emotion of varying pa&s;|&s;ions, which immediately darted over his features, informed Mi&s;s Woodley her &s;ecret was di&s;covered&mdash;&s;he hid her face, while the tears that fell down to her bo&s;om, confirmed him in the truth of his &s;ugge&s;tion beyond what oaths could have done.&mdash;A &s;hort interval of &s;ilenced followed, during which &s;he &s;uf|fered tortures for the manner in which he would next &s;peak to her&mdash;two &s;e|conds gave her this reply.</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake take care what you are doing&mdash;you are de&s;troying my pro&s;|pects of futurity&mdash;you are making this world too dear to me."</P>

<P>Lord Elmwood was &s;en&s;ible of the embarra&s;&s;ment his pre&s;ence gave Mi&s;s Woodley, and under&s;tood the reproaches which &s;he &s;eemed to vent upon her&s;elf in &s;ilence.&mdash;To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and &s;aid, "Do you believe me?"</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95">"I do, my lord." She an&s;wered, trembling.</P>
<P>"I will make no unju&s;t u&s;e of what I know." Returned he, with firmne&s;s.</P>

<P>"We are not judges of what belongs to our&s;elves;" &mdash; he replied, &mdash; "I am tran&s;ported at the tidings you have re|vealed, and yet, perhaps, I had better never have heard them."</P>

<P>MISS Woodley &s;tood for &s;ome time to con&s;ider which way &s;he was to go.&mdash; The fir&s;t per&s;on &s;he met would enquire, why &s;he had been weeping to that ex|ce&s;s her eyes were &s;carce di&s;cernible? and if Mi&s;s Milner was to a&s;k the que&s;|tion, in what words could &s;he tell, or in what manner deny the truth?&mdash;To avoid her, was her fir&s;t caution, and &s;he took the only method; &s;he had a hackney-coach ordered, rode &s;everal miles out of town, and returned to dinner with &s;o little remains of her &s;woln eyes, that complaining of the head-ach was a &s;uf|ficient excu&s;e for them.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">Mi&s;s Milner was enough recovered to be pre&s;ent at dinner, though &s;he &s;carce ta&s;ted a mor&s;el.

<PB N="98" REF="99">
a mouthful into her mouth; for where we hope for nothing, we receive &s;mall indulgences with joy,</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the anxiety and trouble under which Mi&s;s Woodley had laboured all the morning, her heart for many weeks had not felt &s;o light as it did this day at dinner&mdash;The confidence &s;he repo&s;ed in the promi&s;es of lord Elm|wood&mdash;the firm reliance &s;he had upon his delicacy and his ju&s;tice &mdash; the una|bated kindne&s;s with which her friend received her, while no one &s;u&s;picious thought, &s;he knew, had taken harbour in her bo&s;om&mdash;and the con&s;cious in|tegrity of her own intentions, however &s;he might be mi&s;led by her judgment, all con&s;pired to comfort her with the hope, &s;he had done nothing &s;he ought to wi&s;h recalled.&mdash;But although &s;he felt

thus tranquil, in re&s;pect to what &s;he had divulged, yet &s;he felt a great deal em|barra&s;&s;ed with the dread of next &s;eeing lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, not having &s;pirits to go abroad, pa&s;&s;ed the evening at home&mdash; &s;he read part of a new opera, played upon her guitar, mu&s;ed, &s;ighed, occa|&s;ionally talked with Mi&s;s Woodley, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed the tedious hours till near ten, when Mrs. Horton a&s;ked Mr. Sandford to play a game at piquet, and on his excu&s;ing him&s;elf, Mi&s;s Milner offered in his &s;tead, and was gladly accepted. &mdash;They had ju&s;t begun to play when lord Elmwood came into the room&mdash; Mi&s;s Milner's countenance immediate|ly brightened, and although &s;he was in a negligent morning dre&s;s, and looked paler than u&s;ual, &s;he did not look le&s;s

beautiful&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley was leaning on the back of her chair to ob&s;erve the game, and Mr. Sandford &s;at reading one of the Greek Fathers at the other &s;ide of the fire place. Lord Elmwood as he advanced to the table bowed, not having &s;een the ladies &s;ince morning, or Mi&s;s Milner that day; they re|turned his &s;alute, and he was going up to Mi&s;s Milner, (&s;eemingly to enquire of her health,) when Mr. Sandford, laying down his book, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"My lord, where have you been all day?"</P>
<P>"I have been very bu&s;y." Replied his lord&s;hip, and walking from the card-table went up to him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner began to make mi&s;takes, and play one card for another.</P>
<P>"You have been at Mr. Fenton's this evening, I &s;uppo&s;e?" Said Sandford.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">"No, not at all to-day." Replied his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"How came that about, my lord?" Cried Sandford.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner played the ace of dia|monds, in&s;tead of the king of hearts.</P>

<P>Mrs. Horton begged her "To mind what &s;he was about."</P>
<P>"She replied, "I am much better, Sir."</P>
<P>He then returned to Sandford again: but never, during all this time, did his eye once encounter Mi&s;s Woodley's, and &s;he, with equal care, avoided his.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">Some cold di&s;hes were now brought up for &s;upper&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner lo&s;t deal, and the game ended.</P>

gratitude was expre&s;&s;ed by blu&s;hes, and by a&s;&s;uring his lord&s;hip &s;he was now "&s;o well as to be able to &s;up on what was before her."&mdash;She &s;poke, however, and had not made the trial; for the mo|ment &s;he carried a piece to her lips, &s;he laid it on her plate again, and turned paler, from the vain endeavour to force her appetite. Lord Elmwood had ever been attentive to her, but now he watch|ed her as he would a child; and when he &s;aw by her &s;truggles &s;he could not eat, he took her plate from her; gave her &s;omething el&s;e; and all with a care and watchfulne&s;s in his looks, as if he had been a tender-hearted boy, and &s;he his darling bird, the lo&s;s of which, would embitter all the joy of his holi|days.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">This attention had &s;omething about it &s;o tender, &s;o officious, and yet &s;o &s;incere, that it brought the tears into Mi&s;s Woodley's eyes, attracted the no|tice of Mr. Sandford, and the ob&s;erva|tion of Mrs. Horton, while the heart of Mi&s;s Milner overflowed with a grati|tude that gave place to no &s;entiment, except her love.</P>
<P>To relieve that anxiety her guardian expre&s;&s;ed, &s;he endeavoured to appear cheerful, and that anxiety, at length, really made her &s;o.&mdash;He now pre&s;&s;ed her to take one gla&s;s of wine with &s;uch &s;olicitude, he &s;eemed to &s;ay a thou&s;and things be&s;ide &mdash; Sandford &s;till made his ob&s;ervations, and being unu&s;ed to conceal his thoughts before the pre&s;ent company, he &s;aid, bluntly,</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106">"Mi&s;s Fenton was indi&s;po&s;ed the other night, my lord, and yet you did not &s;eem half &s;o anxious about her health."</P>
<P>Had Sandford laid all lord Elm|wood's e&s;tate at Mi&s;s Milner's feet, or pre&s;ented her with that eternal bloom which adorns the face of a godde&s;s, he would have done le&s;s to endear him&s;elf to her, than by that &s;ingle &s;entence&mdash; &s;he looked at him with the mo&s;t be|nign countenance, and felt affliction that &s;he had ever offended him.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fenton," (lord Elmwood re|plied) "has a brother with her; her health and happine&s;s are in his care, Mi&s;s Milner's are in mine."</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "I am afraid I behaved very uncivilly to

you la&s;t night; will you accept of an atonement?</P>
<P>"No, madam," returned he, "I ac|cept no expiation without amendment."</P>

<P>"Why then, you'll break your pro|mi&s;e." Returned he, churli&s;hly.</P>
<P>"Do not promi&s;e," &s;aid lord Elm|wood, "for he means to provoke you to it."</P>
<P>In the like conver&s;ation the evening was pa&s;&s;ed, and Mi&s;s Milner retired to re&s;t in far better &s;pirits than the morn|ing's pro&s;pect had given her to hope for. Mi&s;s Woodley too, had cau&s;e to be well plea&s;ed, but her plea&s;ure was in a great mea&s;ure eclip&s;ed by the reflec|tion, "there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Mi&s;s

<P>WITHIN a few days, in the hou&s;e of lord Elmwood, every thing, and every per&s;on wore a new face.&mdash;His lord|&s;hip was the profe&s;t lover of Mi&s;s Mil|ner&mdash;&s;he, the happie&s;t of human beings &mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley partaking in her joy &mdash;while Mr. Sandford was lamenting with the deepe&s;t concern, that Mi&s;s Fenton had been &s;upplanted; and what added mo&s;t poignantly to his &s;orrow was, that &s;he had been &s;upplanted by Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;Though a church man, he bore his di&s;appointment with the impatience of one of the laity; he could hardly &s;peak to lord Elmwood; he would not look at Mi&s;s Milner, and was di&s;plea&s;ed with every body. &mdash; It
<PB N="109" REF="110">
was his intention when he fir&s;t became acquainted with lord Elmwood's re&s;olu|tion, to quit his hou&s;e; and as his lord&s;hip had, with the utmo&s;t degree of inflexi|bility, re&s;i&s;ted all his good coun&s;el and advice upon this &s;ubject, he re&s;olved, in quitting him, never to be his advi&s;er or coun&s;ellor again.&mdash;But, in preparing to leave his friend, his pupil, his patron, and yet him, who, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, implicitly obeyed his will, the &s;piritual got the better of the temporal man, and he determined to &s;tay, le&s;t in totally abandoning him to the pur&s;uit of his own pa&s;&s;ions, he might make his puni&s;hment even greater than his offence.&mdash;"My lord," &s;aid he, "on the &s;tormy &s;ea, upon which you are embarked, though you will not &s;hun the rocks your faithful pilot would point out, he will, neverthele&s;s, &s;ail in

your company, and lament over your watery grave. The more you &s;light my advice, the more you want it, and till you command me to leave your hou&s;e, (as I &s;uppo&s;e you will &s;oon do, to ob|lige your lady) I will continue along with you."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood liked him &s;incerely, and was glad he took this re&s;olution; yet as &s;oon as his lord&s;hip's rea&s;on and af|fections had once told him, he ought to break with Mi&s;s Fenton, and marry his ward, he became &s;o decidedly of that opinion, Sandford's never had the mo&s;t trivial weight upon the &s;ubject, nor would he flatter the &s;uppo&s;ed authority he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over him, by urging him to remain in his hou&s;e a &s;ingle day, con|trary to his inclinations. Sandford be|held, with grief, this firmne&s;s, but find|ing
<PB N="111" REF="112">
it vain to contend, &s;ubmitted&mdash;not, however, with a good grace.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the per&s;ons affected by this change in lord Elmwood's mar|riage de&s;igns, Mi&s;s Fenton was, per|haps, the lea&s;t&mdash;&s;he would have been content to have married, &s;he was con|tented to live &s;ingle &mdash; Mr. Sandford was the fir&s;t who made overtures to her on the part of lord Elmwood, and the fir&s;t &s;ent to a&s;k her to di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation &mdash; She received both the&s;e propo&s;als with the &s;ame in&s;ipid &s;mile of approbation, and the &s;ame cold indiffer|ence at the heart.</P>
<P>It was a perfect knowledge of this di&s;po&s;ition in his intended wife, which had given to lord Elmwood's thoughts, on matrimony, the pro&s;pect of dreary
<PB N="112" REF="113">
winter; but the &s;en&s;ibility of Mi&s;s Mil|ner had now rever&s;ed that pro&s;pect to perpetual &s;pring; or the dearer variety of &s;pring, &s;ummer, and autumn.</P>
<P>It was a knowledge al&s;o of this tor|por in Mi&s;s Fenton's nature, from which he formed the purpo&s;e of break|ing with her; for lord Elmwood &s;till retained enough of the prie&s;t's &s;anctity, to have yielded up his own happine&s;s, and even that of his beloved ward, ra|ther than have plunged one heart into affliction by his perfidy. This, before he offered his hand to Mi&s;s Milner, he was perfectly convinced would not be the ca&s;e&mdash;even Mi&s;s Fenton, her&s;elf, a&s;|&s;ured him, her thoughts were more in|clined towards the joys of Heaven than earth; and as this circum&s;tance would, &s;he believed, induce her to retire to a convent, &s;he thought it a happy, rather

than an unhappy event.&mdash;Her brother, on whom her fortune devolved if &s;he took this re&s;olution, was exactly of her opinion.</P>
<P>Lo&s;t in the maze of happine&s;s which &s;urrounded her, Mi&s;s Milner oftentimes a&s;ked her heart, and her heart whi&s;pered like a flatterer, "Yes." Are not my charms even more invincible than I ever believed them to be? Dorriforth, the grave, the &s;anctified, the anchorite Dor|riforth, by their force is animated to all the ardour of the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned lover&mdash;while the proud prie&s;t, the au&s;|tere guardian, is humbled, if I but frown, into the verie&s;t &s;lave of love.&mdash; She then a&s;ked, "Why did I not keep him longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e? he could not have loved me more, I believe; but my power over him might have been
<PB N="114" REF="115">
greater &s;till.&mdash;I am the happie&s;t of wo|men in that affection he has proved to me, but I wonder whether it would ex|i&s;t under ill treatment? if it would not, he &s;till does not love me as I wi&s;h to be loved&mdash;if it would, my triumph, my felicity, would be enhanced."&mdash;The&s;e thoughts were mere phantoms of the brain, and never by &s;y&s;tem put into action; but repeatedly indulged, they were practi&s;ed by ca&s;ual occurrences; and the dear-bought experiment of be|ing beloved in &s;pite of her faults, (a glory proud women ever a&s;pire to) was, at pre&s;ent, the ambition of Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>Unthinking woman! &s;he did not re|flect, that to the &s;earching eye of lord Elmwood &s;he had faults, with her every care to conceal or overcome them, &s;ufficient to try all his love, and
<PB N="115" REF="116">
all his patience. But what female is not fond of experiments? to which, how few are there, that do not fall a &s;acri|fice!</P>
<P>Perfectly &s;ecure of the affections of the man &s;he loved, her declining health no longer threatened her; her declin|ing &s;pirits returned as before; and the &s;u&s;picions of her guardian being now changed to the liberal confidence of a doating lover, &s;he now again profe&s;&s;ed all her former follies, all her fa&s;hionable levities, and indulged them with le&s;s re&s;traint than &s;he had ever done.</P>
<P>For a while, blinded by his pa&s;&s;ion, lord Elmwood encouraged and admired every new proof of her re&s;tored happi|ne&s;s; nor till &s;ufferance had tempted her to proceed beyond her u&s;ual bounds,
<PB N="116" REF="117">
did he remon&s;trate.&mdash;But &s;he, who as his ward, had been ever gentle, and (when he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed) always obedient; he now found as a mi&s;|tre&s;s, &s;ometimes haughty; and to oppo|&s;ition, always in&s;olent.&mdash;He was &s;ur|pri&s;ed, but the novelty plea&s;ed him.&mdash; And Mi&s;s Milner, whom he tenderly loved, could put on no change, or ap|pear in any new character that did not, for the time &s;he adopted it, &s;eem to become her.</P>
<P>Among the many cau&s;es of com|plaint &s;he gave him, want of oeconomy in the di&s;po&s;al of her income was one. &mdash;Bills and drafts came upon him with|out number, while the account, on her part, of money expended, amounted but to articles of dre&s;s &s;he &s;ometimes never wore; toys that were out of fa&s;hion
<PB N="117" REF="118">
before they were paid for; and charities directed by the force of whim.&mdash;Another complaint was, as u&s;ual, extreme late hours, and often-times company he did not approve.</P>
<P>She was charmed to &s;ee his love &s;truggling with his cen&s;ure&mdash;his polite|ne&s;s with his anxiety&mdash;and by the light, frivilous, or re&s;entful manner, in which &s;he treated his admonitions, &s;he tri|umphed in &s;hewing to Mi&s;s Woodley, and, more e&s;pecially to Mr. Sandford, how much &s;he dared upon the &s;trength of his affections.</P>
<P>Every thing in preparation for their marriage, which was to take place at Elmwood-Hou&s;e during the &s;ummer months, &s;he re&s;olved for the &s;hort time &s;he had to remain in London, to let no

occa&s;ion pa&s;s of ta&s;ting all tho&s;e plea|&s;ures which were not likely ever to re|turn; but which, eager as &s;he was in their pur&s;uit, &s;he &s;till placed in no kind of competition with tho&s;e &s;he hoped would &s;ucceed; tho&s;e more &s;edate, and far greater joys &s;he had in dome&s;tic contemplation &mdash; and often, merely to ha&s;ten on the tedious hours that inter|vened, &s;he varied and diverted them with the many recreations her intended hu&s;band could not approve.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened, and it was unfortu|nate it did, that a law-&s;uit and &s;ome other intricate affairs that came with his title and e&s;tate, frequently kept lord Elmwood from his hou&s;e part of the day; &s;ometimes the whole evening; and when at home, would often clo&s;et him for hours with his lawyers.&mdash;But while
<PB N="119" REF="120">
he was thus off his guard, Sandford ne|ver was&mdash;and had Mi&s;s Milner been the deare&s;t thing on earth to him, he could not have watched her more nar|rowly; or had &s;he been the fraile&s;t thing on earth, he could not have been more hard upon her, in all the ac|counts of her conduct he gave to lord Elmwood.&mdash;His lord&s;hip knew Sand|ford's failing was to think ill of Mi&s;s Milner, he pitied him for it, and he pitied her for it&mdash;and all the aggrava|tion his repre&s;entations gave to her real follies, affection for them both, in the heart of Dorriforth, &s;tood between every other impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But facts are glaring; and he at length beheld tho&s;e faults in their true colours, although previou&s;ly pointed out by the prejudice of Mr. Sandford.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">As &s;oon as Sandford perceived his lord&s;hip's unea&s;ine&s;s, "There, my lord!" cried he, exultingly, "Did I not always &s;ay the marriage was an improper one? &mdash; but you would not be ruled &mdash; you would not &s;ee."</P>
<P>"Can you blame me for not &s;eeing," replied his lord&s;hip, "when you your|&s;elf were blind?&mdash;Had you been di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate, had you &s;een Mi&s;s Milner's vir|tues as well as her faults, I &s;hould have believed, and been guided by you&mdash;but you &s;aw her failings only, and therein have been equally deceived with me, who have only beheld her perfections."</P>
<P>"My ob&s;ervations, however, my lord, would have been of mo&s;t u&s;e to you; for I have &s;een what to avoid."</P>
<P>"But mine have been the mo&s;t cha|ritable," replied his lord&s;hip, "for I have &s;een&mdash;what I mu&s;t always love."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">Sandford &s;ighed, and lifted up his hands.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," re&s;umed his lord|&s;hip, with a voice and manner &s;uch as he puts on when not all the power of Sandford, or any other, can change his fixed determination, "Mr. Sandford," re&s;umed he, "my eyes are now open to every failing, as well as to every accompli&s;hment; to every vice, as well as to every virtue of Mi&s;s Milner's; nor will I &s;uffer my&s;elf to be again prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour by your prejudice again&s;t her&mdash; for I believe it was com|pa&s;&s;ion at your unkind treatment of her, that fir&s;t gained her my heart."</P>
<P>"I, my lord?" cried Sandford, "Do not load me with the burthen&mdash;with the mighty burthen of your love for her."</P>
<P>"Do not interrupt me." Said his lord&s;hip; "Whatever your meaning has
<PB N="122" REF="123">
been, the effect of your unkindne&s;s to her, is what I &s;ay.&mdash;Now, I will no longer," continued he, "have an enemy &s;uch as you have been, to heighten her charms, which are too tran&s;cendent in their native &s;tate. I will hear no more complaints again&s;t her, but I will watch her clo&s;ely my&s;elf&mdash;and if I find her mind and heart (&s;uch as my &s;u&s;picions have of late whi&s;pered) too frivolous for that &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s I look for with an object &s;o beloved; depend up|on my word&mdash;the marriage &s;hall yet be broken off."</P>
<P>"I depend upon your word; it <HI>will</HI> then." Replied Sandford, eagerly.</P>
<P>"You are unju&s;t, Sir, in &s;aying &s;o before the trial," replied his lord&s;hip, "and your inju&s;tice &s;hall make me more cautious, le&s;t I follow your ex|ample."</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">"But, my lord&mdash;"</P>
<P>"My mind is made up, Mr. Sand|ford." Returned he, interrupting him, "I am no longer engaged to Mi&s;s Milner than &s;he &s;hall de&s;erve I &s;hould&mdash; but in my ob&s;ervations I will take care not to wrong her as you have done."</P>
<P>"My lord, call my ob&s;ervations wrong, when you have reflected upon them as a man, and not as a lover&mdash; dive&s;t your&s;elf of your pa&s;&s;ion, and meet me upon equal ground."</P>
<P>"I will meet no one&mdash;I will con&s;ult no one&mdash;my own judgment &s;hall be the judge, and in a few months marry, or &mdash;<HI>bani&s;h me from her for ever.</HI>"</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in the&s;e la&s;t words, in the tone and firmne&s;s with which they were delivered, that the heart of Sandford re&s;ted upon with con|tent
<PB N="124" REF="125">
&mdash;they bore the &s;ymptoms of a me|nace that would be executed; and he parted from his patron with congratula|tions upon his wi&s;dom, and the warme&s;t a&s;&s;urances of his firm reliance on his <HI>word.</HI></P>
<P>Lord Elmwood having come to this re&s;olution, was more compo&s;ed than he had been for &s;everal days before; while the horror of dome&s;tick wrangles&mdash;a family without &s;ubordination&mdash;a hou&s;e without oeconomy&mdash;in a word, a wife without di&s;cretion, had been perpetually pre&s;ent to his mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Sandford, although he was a man of under&s;tanding, of learning, and a complete ca&s;ui&s;t; yet, all the faults he him&s;elf committed, were entirely&mdash;for want of knowing better.&mdash;He con&s;tantly
<PB N="125" REF="126">
reproved faults in others, and he was mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly too good a man not to have corrected and amended his own, had they been known to him&mdash;but they were not.&mdash;He had been for &s;o long time the &s;uperior of all with whom he lived, had been &s;o bu&s;ied with in&s;tructing others, he had not recollected he him|&s;elf wanted in&s;tructions &mdash; and in &s;uch awe did his &s;everity keep all about him, that notwith&s;tanding he had many friends, not one told him of his failings&mdash;(except ju&s;t now lord Elm|wood, but who, in this in&s;tance, as a man in love, he would not credit)&mdash; Was there not then &s;ome rea&s;on for him to &s;uppo&s;e he had no faults?&mdash;his enemies, indeed, hinted that he had, but enemies he never hearkened to; and thus, with all his good &s;en&s;e, wanted the &s;en&s;e to follow the rule, <HI>Be|lieve
<PB N="126" REF="127">
what your enemies &s;ay of you, rather than what is &s;aid by your friends</HI>; this rule attended to, would make many a one amiable that is now the rever&s;e, and had made him, a perfect upright character.&mdash;For could an enemy, to whom he would have li&s;tened, whi&s;per|ed to Sandford as he left lord Elm|wood's &s;tudy, "Cruel, barbarous man! you go away with your heart &s;atisfied, nay, even elated in the pro&s;pect, that Mi&s;s Milner's hopes, on which &s;he alone exi&s;ts; tho&s;e hopes which keep her from the deepe&s;t affliction, and cheri&s;h her with joy and gladne&s;s, will all be di&s;ap|pointed&mdash;you flatter your&s;elf it is for the &s;ake of your friend lord Elmwood you rejoice; becau&s;e he has e&s;caped a dan|ger&mdash;you wi&s;h him well, but there is another cau&s;e for your exultation which you will not &s;eek to know&mdash;it is, that

<P>Had any one &s;aid this, to Sandford, whom he would have credited; or had his own heart &s;ugge&s;ted it, he was a man of that rectitude and con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s, he would have returned immediately to lord Elmwood, and have endeavoured to &s;trengthen all his favourable opinions of his intended wife&mdash;but having no &s;uch monitor as this, he walked on, highly contented, and meeting Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;aid, with an air of triumph,</P>
<P>"Where's your young lady?&mdash;where's lady Elmwood?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;miled, and an&s;wered&mdash; &s;he was gone with &s;uch and &s;uch ladies
<PB N="128" REF="129">
to an auction.&mdash;"But why give her that title already, Mr. Sandford?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e," an&s;wered he, "I think &s;he will never have it."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, Mr. Sandford!" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "you &s;hock me!"</P>
<P>"I thought I &s;hould," replied he, "and that is why I tell it you."</P>
<P>"For Heaven's &s;ake, what has hap|pened?" Cried &s;he.</P>
<P>"Nothing new &mdash; her indi&s;cretions only."</P>
<P>"I know &s;he is imprudent," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley; "I can &s;ee &s;he is often to blame&mdash;but then my lord &s;urely loves her, and love will overlook a great deal."</P>
<P>"He does love her&mdash;but he has un|der&s;tanding and re&s;olution.&mdash;He loved his &s;i&s;ter too, tenderly loved her, and yet when he had taken the re&s;olution;
<PB N="129" REF="130">
pa&s;&s;ed his word he would never &s;ee her again; even upon her death-bed he would not retract it &mdash; no entreaties could prevail upon him.&mdash;And now, though he maintains, and I dare &s;ay loves her child, yet you remember when you brought him home he would not bear him in his &s;ight."</P>
<P>"Poor Mi&s;s Milner!"&mdash;Said Mi&s;s Woodley in the mo&s;t pitying accents.</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid Sandford, "lord Elm|wood has not yet pa&s;&s;ed his word, that he will never &s;ee her more&mdash;he has only threatened to &s;ay &s;o &mdash; but I know enough of him to know, his threats are generally the &s;ame as the actions done."</P>
<P>"You are very good," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "to acquaint me of this in time: I may now warn Mi&s;s Milner of it, and &s;he may behave with more cir|cum&s;pection."</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">"By no means,"&mdash;cried Sandford, ha&s;tily, "What would you warn her for?&mdash;it will do her no good&mdash;be&s;ides," added he, "I don't know whether his lord&s;hip does not expect &s;ecre&s;y from me on this &s;ubject, and if he does&mdash;"</P>
<P>"But, with all deference to your opinion," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, (and with all deference did &s;he &s;peak) "don't you think, Mr. Sandford, that &s;ecre&s;y upon this occa&s;ion would be wicked? for con&s;ider the angui&s;h it may cau&s;e my friend, and if by advi&s;ing her we can &s;ave her from&mdash;" She was going on.</P>
<P>"You may call wicked, madam, not to inform her of it," cried he, "but I call a breach of promi&s;e (if I did give my promi&s;e, which I don't &s;ay I did) much more &s;inful."</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132">"I &s;uppo&s;e you are right; Sir," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, with humility; "but if you have given <HI>your</HI> promi&s;e, I have not given mine, and therefore may di|vulge&mdash;"</P>
<P>"There now!" cried Sandford, "there is how you judge of this matter.&mdash;You judge of things as they are in reality, not what they are by con&s;truction; the only way to judge of any thing.&mdash;If I did make a promi&s;e to lord Elmwood &mdash;(which, I again &s;ay, I don't know that I did)&mdash;the promi&s;e was, that I would not communicate the &s;ecret; meaning, not tell it to Mi&s;s Milner her&s;elf. &mdash; I have not; and therefore have kept my word&mdash;and in revealing it to you, I did it with a full per&s;ua&s;ion you would conceal it; which confi|dence, on my part, binds you as much
<PB N="132" REF="133">
as the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e you could have given."</P>
<P>"The fault will be mine, then, not yours, if it comes to the knowledge of Mi&s;s Milner?"</P>
<P>"Certainly."</P>
<P>"Then, as it will be my fault, do not you, Sir, be unea&s;y about it."&mdash;</P>
<P>He was going to explain again, but Mi&s;s Milner entered, and put an end to the di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;She had been pa&s;&s;ing the whole morning at an auction, and had laid out near two hundred pounds in different things &s;he had no one u&s;e for; but bought them becau&s;e they were &s;aid to be cheap.&mdash;Among the re&s;t was a lot of books on chemi&s;try, and &s;ome Latin authors.</P>
<P>"Why, madam," cried Sandford, looking over the catalogue, where her purcha&s;es were marked by a pencil,
<PB N="133" REF="134">
"do you know what you have done? you can't read a word of the&s;e books."</P>
<P>"Can't I, Mr. Sandford? but I a&s;&s;ure you, you will be va&s;tly plea&s;ed with them when you &s;ee how elegantly they are bound."</P>
<P>"My dear," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "why have you bought china? you and lord Elmwood have more now, than you have places to put them in."</P>
<P>"Very true, Mrs. Horton&mdash;I forgot that&mdash;but then you know I can give the&s;e away."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was in the room at the conclu&s;ion of this conver&s;ation&mdash; he &s;hook his head and &s;ighed.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid &s;he, "I have had a very plea&s;ant morning, but I wi&s;hed for you&mdash;if you had been with me I &s;hould have bought a great many other things;
<PB N="134" REF="135">
but I did not like to appear unrea&s;on|able in your ab&s;ence."</P>
<P>"Sandford fixed his inqui&s;itive eyes upon lord Elmwood, to ob&s;erve his countenance&mdash;his lord&s;hip &s;miled, but appeared thoughtful.</P>
<P>"And, oh! my lord, I have bought you a pre&s;ent." Said &s;he.</P>
<P>"I do not wi&s;h for a pre&s;ent, Mi&s;s Milner."</P>
<P>"What, not from me?&mdash;very well."</P>
<P>"If you pre&s;ent me with your&s;elf, madam, it is all I a&s;k."</P>
<P>Sandford moved upon his chair as if he &s;at unea&s;y.</P>
<P>Why then, Mi&s;s Woodley," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "<HI>you</HI> &s;hall have the pre|&s;ent.&mdash;But then it won't &s;uit you&mdash;it is for a gentleman.&mdash;I'll keep it and give it to my lord Frederick the fir&s;t time I meet with him.&mdash;I &s;aw him this morn|ing,

<P>Mi&s;s Woodley ca&s;t, by &s;tealth, an eye of apprehen&s;ion upon lord Elm|wood's face, and trembled to behold it red as &s;carlet.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;tared with both his eyes full upon him; then drew him&s;elf up|right on his chair, and took a pinch of &s;nuff upon the &s;trength of his unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;ilence en&s;ued.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort time&mdash;"You all appear very melancholy," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner; "I wi&s;h I had not come home yet."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was in agony&mdash;&s;he &s;aw lord Elmwood's extreme di&s;plea&s;ure, and dreaded le&s;t he &s;hould expre&s;s it by &s;ome words he could not recall, or &s;he could not forgive&mdash;therefore, whi&s;pering to her &s;he had &s;omething particular to &s;ay to her, &s;he took her out of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">The moment &s;he was gone, Mr. Sand|ford ro&s;e nimbly from his &s;eat, rubbed his hands, walked bri&s;kly acro&s;s the room, then a&s;ked his lord&s;hip, in a cheerful tone, "Whether he dined at home to-day?"</P>
<P>That which had given Sandford &s;pirits to &s;peak with cheerfulne&s;s, had de|pre&s;&s;ed lord Elmwood's &s;o much, that he &s;at &s;ilent and dejected.&mdash;At length he an&s;wered, in a faint voice, "No, I believe I &s;hall <HI>not</HI> dine at home."</P>

<P>"I have not yet determined where I &s;hall dine." Replied he, taking no no|tice of the conclu&s;ion of her &s;peech.</P>

<P>MISS Woodley, for the fir&s;t time, di&s;obeyed the will of Mr. Sandford; and as &s;oon as Mi&s;s Milner and &s;he were alone, informed her of all he had re|vealed to her; accompanying the recital with every te&s;timony of &s;ympathy and affection.&mdash;But had the genius of Sand|ford pre&s;ided over this di&s;covery, it could not have influenced the mind of Mi&s;s Milner to receive the intelligence, more exactly oppo&s;ite to the intention of the informer.

di&s;appointed of the plea&s;ure &s;he expected in dining with him; and his &s;udden ab|&s;ence &s;o immediately after the intelli|gence &s;he had received from Mi&s;s Woodley, encrea&s;ed her unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash; She drew her chair, and &s;at down with an indifference, that &s;aid &s;he &s;hould not eat; and as &s;oon as &s;he was &s;eated, &s;he put her fingers &s;ullenly to her lips, nor touched her knife and fork, or &s;poke a word in reply to any thing that was &s;aid to her during the whole din|ner.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley and Mrs. Horton were both too well acquainted with the good di&s;po&s;ition of her heart, to take offence, or any notice of this behaviour. &mdash;They dined, and wi&s;ely &s;aid nothing either to provoke or &s;ooth her.&mdash;Ju&s;t as the dinner was going to be removed, a loud rap came at the door&mdash;"Who is that?" Said Mrs. Horton.&mdash;One of
<PB N="142" REF="143">
the &s;ervants went to the window, and an&s;wered, "My lord and Mr. Sand|ford, madam."&mdash;"Come back to din|ner, as I live." Cried Mrs. Horton.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner &s;till continued her po&s;i|tion and &s;aid nothing&mdash;but at the corners of her mouth, which her fingers did not entirely cover, there were di&s;coverable a thou&s;and dimpled graces like &s;mall convul&s;ive fibres, which a re&s;trained &s;mile on lord Elmwood's return, had &s;ent there.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip and Sandford entered.</P>
<P>"I am glad you are returned, my lord," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "for Mi&s;s Mil|ner would not eat a mor&s;el."</P>
<P>"It was becau&s;e I had no appe|tite." Returned &s;he, blu&s;hing like crim&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">"We &s;hould not have come back," &s;aid Sandford, "but at the place where we went to dine, all the rooms were filled with &s;moke."</P>
<P>"It has been a very windy day in|deed," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "and one part of this hou&s;e, is now in a &s;mo|ther."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood put the wing of a fowl on Mi&s;s Milner's plate, but with|out previou&s;ly a&s;king if &s;he cho&s;e any; yet &s;he conde&s;cended to eat&mdash;they &s;poke to each other too in the cour&s;e of con|ver&s;ation, yet it was with a re&s;erve that appeared as if they had been quarrel|ling, and &s;o felt to them&s;elves, though no &s;uch circum&s;tance had happened.</P>
<P>About two weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in this kind of di&s;tant behaviour on both &s;ides; without either venturing a direct
<PB N="144" REF="145">
quarrel, and without either expre&s;&s;ing (except inadvertently) their &s;trong af|fection for each other.</P>
<P>During this time they were once, however, nearly becoming the deare&s;t friends in expre&s;&s;ions, as well as in &s;en|timents.&mdash;This aro&s;e from a favour he granted in compliance to what he knew was her earne&s;t de&s;ire; and, as a fa|vour which he had refu&s;ed to the re|peated reque&s;ts of many friends, &s;he could not but e&s;teem the high value of the obligation.</P>
<P>She and Mi&s;s Woodley had taken an airing to &s;ee the poor child, young Ru&s;hbrook; and on their return, his lord&s;hip inquiring of the ladies how they had pa&s;&s;ed their morning, Mi&s;s Milner frankly told him; and added,
<PB N="145" REF="146">
"What pain it gave her to leave the child behind, as he &s;till cried to come away with her."</P>
<P>"Go for him then to-morrow," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, and bring him home."</P>
<P>"Home!" She repeated, with &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied he, "if you de&s;ire it, this &s;hall be his home&mdash;you &s;hall be a mother, and I will, henceforward, be a father to him."</P>
<P>Sandford, who was pre&s;ent, looked unu&s;ually four at this high token of his lord&s;hip's regard to Mi&s;s Milner; yet, with re&s;entment on his face, he wiped a tear of joy from his eye, for the boy's &s;ake&mdash;his frown was the force of preju|dice, his tear the force of nature.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was brought home; and whenever lord Elmwood wi&s;hed to &s;hew
<PB N="146" REF="147">
a kindne&s;s to Mi&s;s Milner, without di|recting it immediately to her, he took his nephew upon his knee, talked to him, and told him, he "Was glad they had become acquainted."</P>
<P>In the various, though delicate, &s;trug|gles for power between Mi&s;s Milner and her guardian, there was not one per&s;on witne&s;s to the&s;e incidents, who did not &s;uppo&s;e, all would at la&s;t end in wed|lock&mdash;for the mo&s;t common ob&s;erver perceived, ardent love was the founda|tion of every di&s;content, as well, as of every joy they experienced.&mdash;One great incident, however, totally rever&s;ed the pro&s;pect of all future accommodation.</P>
<P>The fa&s;hionable Mrs. G&mdash; gave a ma&s;ked ball; tickets were pre&s;ented to per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality, and
<PB N="147" REF="148">
among the re&s;t, three were &s;ent to Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;She had never been at a ma&s;|querade, and received them with ex|tacy&mdash;more e&s;pecially as the ma&s;que being at the hou&s;e of a woman of fa&s;h|ion, &s;he did not conceive there could be any objection to her going.&mdash;She was mi&s;taken&mdash;the moment &s;he mentioned it to lord Elmwood, he de&s;ired her, &s;omewhat &s;ternly, "Not to think of being there." &mdash; She was vext at the prohibition, but more at the manner in which it was delivered, and flatly &s;aid, "She &s;hould certainly go."</P>
<P>She expected a &s;evere rebuke for this, but what alarmed her much more, he never replied a word; but looked with a re&s;ignation which foreboded her more &s;orrow, than the &s;evere&s;t reproaches would have done. &mdash; She &s;at for a mi|nute reflecting how to rou&s;e him from
<PB N="148" REF="149">
this compo&s;ure&mdash;&s;he fir&s;t thought of at|tacking him with upbraidings; then &s;he thought of &s;oothing him; and at la&s;t of laughing at him.&mdash;This was the lea&s;t &s;upportable of all, and yet this &s;he ven|tured upon.</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure your lord&s;hip," &s;aid &s;he, "with all your &s;aintline&s;s, can have no objection to my being pre&s;ent at the ma&s;querade, provided I go as a Nun."</P>
<P>He made no reply.</P>
<P>"That is a habit," continued &s;he, "which covers a multitude of faults&mdash; and, for that evening, I may have the chance of making a conque&s;t even of you, my lord&mdash;nay, I que&s;tion not, if under that inviting attire, even the pi|ous Mr. Sandford would not ogle me."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h."&mdash;Said Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Why hu&s;h?" cried Mi&s;s Mil|ner, aloud, though Mi&s;s Woodley
<PB N="149" REF="150">
had &s;poken in a whi&s;per, "I am &s;ure," continued &s;he, "I am only repeating what I have read in books about nuns, and their confe&s;&s;ors."</P>
<P>"Your conduct, Mi&s;s Milner," re|plied lord Elmwood, "gives evident proofs what authors you have read; you may &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble of quoting them."</P>
<P>Her pride was hurt at this, beyond bearing; and as &s;he could not, like him, govern her anger, it flu&s;hed in her face, and almo&s;t forced the tears.</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, (in a voice &s;o &s;oft and peaceful, it ought to have calmed the re&s;entment of both,) "my lord, &s;uppo&s;e you were to ac|company Mi&s;s Milner? there are tickets for three, and you can then have no objection."</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">Mi&s;s Milner's brow was immedi|ately &s;moothed; her eye beamed hope; and &s;he fetched a &s;igh in anxious ex|pectation he would con&s;ent.</P>
<P>"I go, Mi&s;s Woodley?" he replied, with a&s;toni&s;hment, "Do you imagine I would play the buffoon at a ma&s;que|rade?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner's face changed to its former &s;tate.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een many grave characters there, my lord." Said Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Woodley," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "why per&s;uade lord Elmwood to put on a ma&s;k, ju&s;t at the time he has laid it a&s;ide?"</P>
<P>His patience &s;eemed now to be tempted to its height, and he an&s;wered, "If you &s;u&s;pect it, madam, you &s;hall find me changed."</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152">Plea&s;ed, &s;he had been able at la&s;t to irritate him, &s;he &s;miled with a degree of triumph, and in that humour was going to reply; but before &s;he could &s;peak four words, and before &s;he thought of it, he abruptly left the room.</P>
<P>She was highly offended at this in|&s;ult, and declared, "From that mo|ment &s;he bani&s;hed him her heart for ever." And to prove &s;he &s;et both his love and anger at defiance, &s;he imme|diately ordered her chariot, and &s;aid, &s;he "was going to &s;ome of her ac|quaintance, whom &s;he knew had tickets, and with whom &s;he would fix upon the dre&s;s &s;he meant to appear in at the ma&s;querade; for nothing, unle&s;s &s;he was locked up, &s;hould alter the re&s;olution &s;he had taken, of being there." To re|mon&s;trate
<PB N="152" REF="153">
at that moment, Mi&s;s Wood|ley knew would be in vain; the chariot came to the door, and &s;he drove away.</P>
<P>She did not return to dinner, nor till late in the evening; lord Elmwood was at home, but never once mentioned her name.</P>
<P>She came home, after he had retired to bed, and in great &s;pirits; the fir&s;t time &s;he ever appeared carele&s;s what he might think of her behaviour:&mdash;but her whole thoughts were occupied upon the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had been about, and her dre&s;s engro&s;&s;ed all her conver&s;ation as &s;oon as Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were alone.&mdash;She told Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;he had been &s;hewn the greate&s;t variety of beau|tiful and becoming dre&s;&s;es &s;he had ever beheld, and yet, &s;aid &s;he, "I have fixed
<PB N="153" REF="154">
upon a very plain one; but one I look &s;o well in, you will hardly know me when I have it on."</P>
<P>"You are &s;eriou&s;ly then re&s;olved to go," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "provided you hear no more on the &s;ubject from your guardian?"</P>
<P>"Whether I do or not, Mi&s;s Wood|ley, I am equally re&s;olved to go."</P>
<P>"But you know, my dear, he has de&s;ired you not &mdash; and you u&s;ed always to obey his commands."</P>
<P>"As my guardian, I certainly did obey him; and I could obey him as a hu&s;band; but as a lover, I will not."</P>
<P>"Yet that is the means, never to have him for a hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"As he plea&s;es&mdash;for if he will not &s;ubmit to be my lover, I will not &s;ub|mit to be his wife &mdash; nor has he the af|fection I require in a hu&s;band."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">Thus, the old &s;entiments were re|peated as heretofore, and prevented a &s;eparation till towards morning.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, for that night, dreamt le&s;s of her guardian than of the ma&s;|querade. On the evening of the next day it was to be; &s;he was up early, breakfa&s;ted in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, and remained there mo&s;t of the day, bu&s;ied in all the thou&s;and preparations for the night; one of which, was to take every particle of powder out of her hair, and have it curled all over in falling ring|lets.&mdash;Her next care was, that her dre&s;s &s;hould exactly fit, and di&s;play her fine per&s;on to the be&s;t advantage&mdash;it did &s;o. &mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley entered as it was try|ing on, and was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the elegance of the habit, and
<PB N="155" REF="156">
the beautiful effect it had upon her graceful per&s;on; but mo&s;t of all, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at her venturing on &s;uch a character&mdash;for although it was there pre|&s;entative of the godde&s;s of Cha&s;tity, yet from the bu&s;kins, and the petticoat made to fe&s;toon far above the ankle, it had, on the fir&s;t glance, the appearance of a a female much le&s;s virtuous. &mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley admired the dre&s;s, yet object|ed to it; but as &s;he admired fir&s;t, her objections after had no weight.</P>
<P>"Where is lord Elmwood?" Said Mi&s;s Milner, "he mu&s;t not &s;ee me."</P>
<P>"No, for heaven's &s;ake," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "I would not have him &s;ee you for the univer&s;e."</P>
<P>"And yet," returned the other, with a &s;igh, "Why am I then thus plea&s;ed with this dre&s;s? for I had rather he &s;hould
<PB N="156" REF="157">
admire me than all the world be&s;ide, and yet he is not to &s;ee me in it."</P>
<P>"But he would not admire you thus." Said Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"How &s;hall I contrive to avoid him," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner, "if he &s;hould offer to hand me into my carriage? &mdash; but I believe he will not be in good hu|mour enough for that."</P>
<P>"You had better dre&s;s at the la|dies' hou&s;e with whom you go." Said Mi&s;s Woodley; and this was agreed upon.</P>
<P>At dinner they learnt, his lord&s;hip was to go that evening to Wind&s;or, in order to be in readine&s;s for the king's hunt, early in the morning; and this intelligence having di&s;per&s;ed Mi&s;s Mil|ner's fears, &s;he concluded to dre&s;s at home."</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">Lord Elmwood appeared at dinner in an even, but not in a good-temper; &mdash; the &s;ubject of the ma&s;querade was never brought up, or indeed was once in his thoughts; for though he was of|fended at his ward's behaviour on the occa&s;ion, and thought &s;he committed a fault in telling him, "She would go," yet he never &s;u&s;pected &s;he meant to do &s;o, not even at the time &s;he &s;aid it, much le&s;s that &s;he would per&s;i&s;t, coolly and deliberately in &s;o direct a contradiction to his will.&mdash;She, for her part, flattered her&s;elf his going to Wind&s;or, was intended in order to give her an opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing the even|ing as &s;he plea&s;ed, without his being obliged to know of it, and con&s;e|quently to complain.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley,
<PB N="158" REF="159">
who was willing to hope as &s;he wi&s;hed, began to be of the &s;ame opinion; and, without reluctance, dre&s;t her&s;elf as a wood-nymph, to accompany her friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>AT half after eleven, Mi&s;s Milner's chair, and another with Mi&s;s Woodley, took them from lord Elmwood's hou&s;e to call upon the party (a group of wood-nymphs and huntre&s;&s;es) which were to acompany them, and make up the &s;uit of Diana.</P>
<P>They had not left the hou&s;e two minutes, when a thundering rap came at the door&mdash;it was lord Elmwood in a po&s;t chai&s;e. &mdash; Upon &s;ome occa&s;ion the next day's hunt was put off: he had been made acquainted with it, and came from Wind&s;or at that late hour. &mdash;After his lord&s;hip had told Mrs. Hor|ton and Mr. Sandford, who were &s;itting
<PB N="160" REF="161">
together, the cau&s;e of his &s;udden re|turn, and &s;ome &s;upper was ordered for him, he inquired, "What company had ju&s;t left the hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>"We have been alone the whole evening, my lord." Replied Mrs. Hor|ton.</P>
<P>"Nay," returned he, "I &s;aw two chairs, with &s;everal &s;ervants, come out of the door as I drove up; but what livery I could not di&s;cern."</P>
<P>"We have had no creature here." Repeated Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"Nor has Mi&s;s Milner?" A&s;ked he.</P>
<P>This brought Mrs. Horton to her recollection, and &s;he cried, "Oh! now I know."&mdash;And then checked her|&s;elf, as if &s;he knew too much.</P>
<P>"What do you know, madam?" Said his lord&s;hip, &s;harply.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">"Nothing"&mdash;&s;aid Mrs. Horton, "I know nothing." And &s;he lifted up her hands and &s;hook her head.</P>
<P>"So all people &s;ay, who know a great deal," cried Sandford, "and I &s;u&s;pect, that is at pre&s;ent your ca&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then I know more than I wi&s;h to know, I am &s;ure, Mr. Sandford." Re|turned &s;he, &s;hrugging up her &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was all impatience. "Explain, madam, explain." Cried he.</P>
<P>"Dear my lord," &s;aid &s;he, "if your lord&s;hip will recollect, you may ju&s;t have the &s;ame knowledge that I have."</P>
<P>"Recollect what?" Said he, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"The quarrel you and your ward had about the ma&s;querade."</P>
<P>"What of that? &s;he is not gone there?" He cried.</P>
<P>"I am not &s;ure &s;he is," returned Mrs. Horton, "but if your lord&s;hip
<PB N="162" REF="163">
&s;aw two &s;edan chairs going out of this hou&s;e, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect it mu&s;t be Mi&s;s Milner, and my niece going to the ma&s;querade."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip made no an&s;wer, but rung the bell violently.&mdash;A &s;ervant en|tered.&mdash;"Send Mi&s;s Milner's woman hither," &s;aid he, "immediately." &mdash; The man withdrew.</P>
<P>"Nay, my lord," cried Mrs. Hor|ton, "any of the other &s;ervants could tell you ju&s;t as well, whether Mi&s;s Mil|ner is at home, or gone out."</P>
<P>"Perhaps not." Replied he.</P>
<P>The maid entered.</P>
<P>"Where is your lady?" Said he.</P>
<P>The woman had received no orders to conceal where her lady was gone, and yet &s;ome &s;ecret influence which go|verns the thoughts of all waiting wo|men
<PB N="163" REF="164">
and chamber maids, whi&s;pered to her, &s;he ought not to tell the truth.</P>
<P>"Where is your lady?" Repeated lord Elmwood, in a louder voice than before.</P>
<P>"Gone out, my lord." She replied.</P>
<P>"Where?"</P>
<P>"My lady did not tell me."</P>
<P>"And don't you know?"</P>
<P>"No, my lord." She an&s;wered, and without blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>"Is this the night of the ma&s;que|rade?" Said he.</P>
<P>"I don't know, my lord, upon my word; but, I believe, my lord, it is not."</P>
<P>Sandford, as &s;oon as lord Elmwood had a&s;ked the la&s;t que&s;tion, run ha&s;tily to the table, at the other &s;ide of the room, &s;natched &s;omething from it, and returned to his place again &mdash; and as
<PB N="164" REF="165">
&s;oon as the maid &s;aid, "It was not the night of the ma&s;querade," he exclaim|ed, "But it is, my lord, it is&mdash;yes, it is." And &s;howing a news-paper he held in his hand, pointed to the paragraph which contained the information.</P>
<P>"Leave the room," &s;aid lord Elm|wood to the woman, "I have done with you."&mdash;She withdrew.</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, here it is." Repeated Sandford, with the paper in his hand. &mdash;He then read the paragraph: "<HI>The ma&s;querade at the honourable Mrs. G&mdash;'s this evening</HI>&mdash;" "This evening, my lord, you find:" "<HI>it is expected will be the mo&s;t brilliant, of any thing of the kind, for the&s;e many years pa&s;t.</HI>"</P>
<P>"They &s;hould not put &s;uch things in the papers," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "to tempt young women to their ruin."
<PB N="165" REF="166">
The word ruin, &s;eemed to grate upon his lord&s;hip's ear, and he &s;aid to the &s;ervant who came to wait on him, while he &s;upped, "Take the &s;upper away." &mdash;He had not attempted to eat, or even to &s;it down; and he now walked backwards and forwards in the room, lo&s;t in thought and care.</P>
<P>A little time after, one of Mi&s;s Mil|ner's footmen came in upon &s;ome occa|&s;ion, and Mr. Sandford &s;aid to him, "Pray did you attend your lady to the ma&s;querade?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir." Replied the man.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;topt him&s;elf &s;hort in his walk, and &s;aid to the &s;ervant, "You did?"</P>
<P>"Yes, my lord." Replied he.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip walked again.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">"I &s;hould like to know what &s;he was dre&s;t in." Said Mrs. Horton; and turning to the &s;ervant, "Do you know what your lady had on?"</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," replied the man, "&s;he was in mens cloaths."</P>
<P>"How?" cried lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"You tell a &s;tory to be &s;ure." Said Mrs. Horton to the &s;ervant,</P>
<P>"No," cried Sandford, "I am &s;ure he does not; for he is an hone&s;t good young man, and would not tell a lie upon any account,&mdash;would you?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood ordered Mi&s;s Mil|ner's woman to be again &s;ent up.&mdash;She came.</P>
<P>"In what dre&s;s did your lady go to the ma&s;querade?" A&s;ked his lord&s;hip, and with a look &s;o extremely moro&s;e, it &s;eemed to command her to an&s;wer in a word, and to an&s;wer truly.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="168">A mind, with a &s;park of &s;en&s;ibility more than &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, could not have equivocated with &s;uch an interrogator, but her reply was, "She went in her own dre&s;s, my lord."</P>
<P>"Was it a man's, or a woman's dre&s;s?" A&s;ked his lord&s;hip with the &s;ame commanding look.</P>
<P>"Ha, ha, my lord," (half laughing and half crying,) "a woman's dre&s;s to be &s;ure, my lord."</P>
<P>On which Sandford cried,</P>
<P>"Call the footman up, and let him confront her."</P>
<P>He was called; but lord Elm|wood, now di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;cene, &s;at down at the farther end of the room, and left Sandford to que&s;tion them.</P>

<P><PB N="169" REF="170">"Had &s;he on, or had &s;he not on, a Coat?" A&s;ked Sandford.</P>

<P>"I can't an&s;wer exactly for that," replied he, "but I know &s;he had boots on."</P>
<P>"They were not boots," replied the maid, with vehemence, "indeed, Sir, (turning to Sandford) they were only half boots."</P>
<P>"My girl," &s;aid Sandford, kindly to her, "your own evidence convicts her. &mdash;What has a woman to do with <HI>any</HI> boots?"</P>

then looking at his watch, found it was near one. "At what time am I to ex|pect her at home?" Said he.</P>
<P>"Perhaps not till three in the morn|ing." An&s;wered Mrs. Horton&punc;</P>
<P>"Three! &s;ix, more likely." Cried Sandford.</P>
<P>"I can't wait with patience till that time." An&s;wered his lord&s;hip with a mo&s;t anxious &s;igh.</P>
<P>"You had better go to bed, my lord," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "and by &s;leeping, the time will pa&s;s away un|perceived."</P>
<P>"If I <HI>could</HI> &s;leep, madam." Returned he.</P>
<P>"Will you play a game of cards, my lord?" &s;aid Sandford, "for I will not leave you till &s;he comes home; and though I am not u&s;ed to &s;it up all night&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172">"All night," repeated his lord&s;hip, "&s;he dur&s;t not &s;tay all night."</P>
<P>"And yet, after going," &s;aid Sand|ford, "in defiance to your commands, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;he dares?"</P>
<P>"She is in good company, at lea&s;t, my lord." Said Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>"She does not know her&s;elf, what company &s;he is in." Replied his lord|&s;hip.</P>
<P>"How &s;hould &s;he?" cried Sandford, "where every one hides his face."</P>
<P>Till five o'clock in the morning, in &s;uch conver&s;ation as this, the hours pa&s;&s;ed away. &mdash; Mrs. Horton, indeed, retired to her chamber at two; and left the gentlemen to a graver di&s;cour&s;e, but a di&s;cour&s;e &s;till le&s;s advantageous to poor Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">She, during this time, was at the &s;cene of plea&s;ure &s;he had pictured to her&s;elf, and all the plea&s;ure it gave her was, that &s;he was &s;ure &s;he &s;hould never de&s;ire to go to a ma&s;querade again. &mdash; The crowd and bu&s;tle fatigued her&mdash;the freedom offended her delicacy &mdash; and though &s;he perceived &s;he was the fir&s;t object of admiration in the place, yet there was one per&s;on &s;till wanting to ad|mire; and the remor&s;e at having tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed his injunctions for &s;o trivial an entertainment, weighed upon her &s;pirits, and added to its wearine&s;s.&mdash;She would have come away &s;ooner than &s;he did, but &s;he could not, with any degree of good manners, leave the company with whom &s;he went, and not till half after four were they prevailed on to return.</P>
<P>Day-light ju&s;t peeped through the &s;hutters of the room where his lord|&s;hip
<PB N="173" REF="174">
and Sandford were &s;itting, when the &s;ound of her carriage, and its &s;ud|den &s;top at the door, cau&s;ed lord Elm|wood as &s;uddenly to &s;tart from his &s;eat. &mdash;He trembled extremely, and looked pale.&mdash;Sandford was a&s;hamed to &s;eem to notice it, yet he could not help a&s;king him, "To take a gla&s;s of wine." &mdash;He took it&mdash;and for once evinced he was reduced &s;o low, as to be <HI>glad</HI> of &s;uch a re&s;ource.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ion thus agitated lord Elm|wood at this cri&s;is, it is hard to define. &mdash;Perhaps it was indignation at Mi&s;s Milner's imprudence, and the &s;atisfac|tion he felt at being on the point of re|venge &mdash; perhaps his emotion aro&s;e from joy, to find &s;he was &s;afe &mdash; perhaps it was perturbation at the regret he felt that he mu&s;t upbraid her &mdash; perhaps it
<PB N="174" REF="175">
was one alone of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, but mo&s;t probably, it was them all com|bined.</P>
<P>She, wearied out with the tedious night's di&s;&s;ipation, and le&s;s joyous than melancholy, had fallen a&s;leep as &s;he rode home, and when the carriage &s;topt, came half a&s;leep out of it. &mdash; "Light me to my bed-chamber in|&s;tantly." Said &s;he to her woman, who waited in the hall to receive her.&mdash;But one of lord Elmwood's valets went up to her, and an&s;wered, "Madam, my lord de&s;ires to &s;ee you before you go to bed."</P>
<P>"Your lord, man?" cried &s;he, "Is he not out of town?"</P>
<P>"No, madam, my lord has been at home ever &s;ince you went out, and has
<PB N="175" REF="176">
been &s;itting up with Mr. Sandford, wait|ing for your return."</P>
<P>She was wide awake in&s;tantly. &mdash; The heavine&s;s was removed from her eyes, but fear, grief, and &s;hame, &s;eized upon her heart. &mdash; She leaned again&s;t her woman, as if unable to &s;upport her|&s;elf under tho&s;e feelings, and &s;aid to Mi&s;s Woodley,</P>
<P>"Make my excu&s;e&mdash;I can't &s;ee him to night&mdash;I am unfit&mdash;indeed I can|not."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was alarmed at the thought of going to him by her&s;elf, and thus perhaps aggravating him &s;till more; &s;he therefore &s;aid, "He has &s;ent for you; for heaven's &s;ake, do not di&s;obey him a &s;econd time."</P>
<P>"No, dear madam," cried her wo|man, "for he is like a lion&mdash;he has been &s;colding me."</P>

<P><PB N="176" REF="179">"Good God!" exclaimed Mi&s;s Mil|ner, (and in a tone that &s;eemed pro|phetic) "Then he is not to be my hu&s;band, after all."</P>
<P>"Yes," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "if you will only be humble, and appear &s;orry. &mdash;You know your power over him, and all may yet be well."</P>
<P>She turned her &s;peaking eyes upon her friend, the tears &s;tarting from them, her lips trembling; "Do I not appear &s;orry?" She cried.</P>
<P>The bell at that moment rung furi|ou&s;ly, and they mended their pace to the door of the apartment where his lord&s;hip was.</P>
<P>"No, this is only fright,"&mdash;replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "Say to him you are &s;orry, and beg his pardon."</P>
<P>"I cannot," &s;aid &s;he, "if Mr. Sand|ford is with him."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="180">The &s;ervant opened the door, and &s;he and Mi&s;s Woodley went in.&mdash;Lord Elmwood by this time was compo&s;ed, and received her with a &s;light inclina|tion of his head; &s;he bowed to him in return, and &s;aid, with &s;ome marks of humility,</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e, my lord, I have done wrong."</P>
<P>"You have indeed, Mi&s;s Milner;" an&s;wered he, "but do not &s;uppo&s;e, I mean to upbraid you; I am, more|over, going to relea&s;e you from any &s;uch apprehen&s;ion <HI>for the future.</HI>"</P>
<P>Tho&s;e la&s;t three words he &s;poke with a countenance &s;o &s;erious and &s;o deter|mined, with an accent &s;o firm and &s;o decided, they pierced through her heart. &mdash;She did not however weep, or even &s;igh; but her friend, Mi&s;s Woodley,
<PB N="178" REF="181">
knowing what &s;he felt, exclaimed, "Oh!" as if for her.</P>
<P>She her&s;elf &s;trove with her angui&s;h, and replied, (but with a faltering voice) "I expected as much, my lord."</P>
<P>"Then, madam, you may perhaps expect all that I intend?"</P>
<P>"In regard to my&s;elf," &s;he replied, "I &s;uppo&s;e I do."</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid he, "you may ex|pect in a few days we &s;hall part."</P>
<P>"I am prepared for it, my lord." She an&s;wered, and while &s;he &s;aid &s;o, &s;unk upon a chair.</P>
<P>"My lord, what you have to &s;ay farther," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, in tears, "defer till the morning; Mi&s;s Milner, you &s;ee, is not able to bear it now."</P>
<P>"I have nothing to &s;ay farther," re|plied he, coolly, "I have now only to act."</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="182">"Lord Elmwood," cried Mi&s;s Mil|ner, divided between grief and anger, "you think to frighten me by your menaces, but I can part with you; hea|ven knows I can&mdash;your late behaviour has reconciled me to a &s;eparation."</P>
<P>On this he was going out of the room &mdash; but Mi&s;s Woodley, catching hold of him, cried, "Oh! my lord, do not leave her in this &s;orrow&mdash;pity her weakne&s;s, and forgive it."&mdash;She was proceeding, and he &s;eemed inclined to li&s;ten to her, when Sandford called out in &s;o &s;harp a tone,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley, what do you mean?" &s;he gave a &s;tart, and de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip turned to Sandford and &s;aid, "Nay, Mr. Sandford, you need entertain no doubts of me; I have judged, and have deter&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="183">He was going to &s;ay determined; but Mi&s;s Milner, who dreaded to hear the word, interrupted the period, and exclaimed, "Oh! could my poor fa|ther know the grief, the days of &s;orrow, I have experienced &s;ince his death, how would he repent his fatal choice in a protector!"</P>
<P>This &s;entence, wherein his friend's memory was recalled, with the addi|tional allu&s;ion to her long, and &s;ecret affection for him&s;elf, affected lord Elm|wood much &mdash; he was moved, but a&s;hamed of being &s;o, and as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, conquered the propen&s;ity. &mdash; Yet, for a &s;hort interval, he did not know whether to go out of the room, or to remain in it; whether to &s;peak, or to be &s;ilent.&mdash;At length he turned towards her and &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="184">"Appeal to your father in &s;ome other form, in that (pointing to her dre&s;s) he will not know you.&mdash;Re|flect upon him too in your moments of di&s;&s;ipation, and let his idea controul your indi&s;cretions&mdash;not merely in an hour of contradiction call peevi&s;hly up|on his name, only to wound the deare&s;t friend you have."</P>
<P>There was a degree of truth, and a degree of feeling, in the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech, that alarmed Sandford, and he caught up one of the candles, and laying hold of his lord&s;hip's elbow, drew him out of the room, crying, "Come, my lord, come to your bed-chamber, it is very late&mdash;it is morn|ing&mdash;it is time to ri&s;e." And by a con|tinual repetition of the&s;e words, in a very loud voice, drowned whatever his
<PB N="182" REF="185">
lord&s;hip, or any other per&s;on, might have wi&s;hed to have &s;poken, or heard. &mdash;In this manner, lord Elmwood was taken out of the apartment, and the evening's entertainment concluded.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>TWO whole days pa&s;&s;ed in the bit|tere&s;t &s;u&s;pen&s;e on the part of Mi&s;s Mil|ner, while neither one word or look from lord Elmwood, denoted the mo&s;t trivial change of tho&s;e &s;entiments he had declared on the night of the ma&s;querade. &mdash;Still tho&s;e &s;entiments, or intentions, were not explicitly delivered; they were more like intimations, than &s;olemn de|clarations &mdash; for though he had &s;aid, "He would never reproach her <HI>for the future,</HI>" and that "&s;he might expect they &s;hould part," he had not po&s;itively &s;aid they &s;hould; and upon this doubtful meaning of his words, &s;he hung with the &s;tronge&s;t agitation of hope, and of fear.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">Mi&s;s Woodley &s;eeing the di&s;tre&s;s of her mind, (much as &s;he endeavoured to conceal it) entreated, nay implored, of her, to permit her to be a mediator; to &s;uffer her to a&s;k for a private inter|view with lord Elmwood, and provided &s;he found him inflexible, behave with a proper degree of &s;pirit in return; but if he appeared not ab&s;olutely aver&s;e to a reconciliation, to offer it to him in &s;o cautious a manner, it might take place without farther unea&s;ine&s;s on either &s;ide. But Mi&s;s Milner pe|remptorily forbad this, and acknow|ledging to her friend every weakne&s;s &s;he felt on the occa&s;ion, yet concluded with &s;olemnly declaring, "That after what had pa&s;&s;ed between her and lord Elmwood, <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t be the fir&s;t to make
<PB N="185" REF="188">
a conce&s;&s;ion, before &s;he her&s;elf would conde&s;cend to be reconciled."</P>
<P>"I believe, I know lord Elmwood's temper," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "and I do not think he will be ea&s;ily induced to beg pardon for a fault, which he thinks you have committed."</P>
<P>"Then he does not love me."</P>
<P>"P&s;haw! Mi&s;s Milner, this is the old argument.&mdash;He may love you too well to &s;poil you&mdash;con&s;ider, he is your guar|dian as well as your lover, he means al&s;o to become your hu&s;band; and he is a man of &s;uch nice honour, he will not give you a &s;pecimen of that power be|fore marriage, which he does not in|tend to &s;ubmit to hereafter."</P>
<P>"But tenderne&s;s, affection, the po|litene&s;s due from a lover to his mi&s;tre&s;s, demands this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and as I now de&s;pair of enticing, I will oblige him
<PB N="186" REF="189">
to it&mdash;at lea&s;t I'll make the trial, and know my fate at once."</P>
<P>"What do you mean to do?"</P>
<P>"Invite my lord Frederick to the hou&s;e, and a&s;k my guardian's con&s;ent for our immediate union; you will then &s;ee, what effect that has upon his pride."</P>
<P>"But you will then make it too late for him to be humble.&mdash;If you re&s;olve on this, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, you are undone at once&mdash;you may thus hurry your&s;elf into a marriage with a man you do not love, and the mi&s;ery of your whole future life may be the re&s;ult.&mdash; Or, would you force Mr. Dorriforth (I mean lord Elmwood) to another duel with my lord Frederick?"</P>
<P>"No, call him Dorriforth&mdash;" an|&s;wered &s;he, with the tears &s;tealing from her eyes, "I thank you for calling him
<PB N="187" REF="190">
&s;o; for by that name alone, is he dear to me."</P>
<P>"Nay, Mi&s;s Milner, with what rap|ture did you not receive his love, as lord Elmwood."</P>
<P>"But under that title he has been barbarous; under the fir&s;t, he was all friend&s;hip and tenderne&s;s."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mi&s;s Milner in|dulged her&s;elf in all tho&s;e &s;oft bewail|ings to her friend&mdash;before lord Elm|wood &s;he maintained a degree of pride and &s;teadine&s;s which &s;urpri&s;ed even him, who had perhaps ever thought le&s;s of her love for him, than any other per&s;on. &mdash; She now began to fear &s;he had gone too far in di&s;covering her affection, and re&s;olved to make trial of a contrary method. &mdash; She determined to retrieve that haughty character which had in|&s;pired
<PB N="188" REF="191">
&s;o many of her admirers with pa&s;&s;ion, and take the chance of the ef|fect upon this only one, to whom &s;he ever acknowledged a mutual love.&mdash;But, although &s;he acted this character well &mdash; &s;o well, that every one but Mi&s;s Woodley thought her in earne&s;t&mdash;yet, with the nice&s;t and mo&s;t attentive anx|iety, did &s;he watch even the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tance, that might revive her hopes, or confirm her de&s;pair. Lord Elmwood's behaviour was calculated to produce the latter&mdash;he was cold, polite, and perfectly indifferent.&mdash;Yet, whatever his manners now were, they did not re|move from her recollection what they had been&mdash;&s;he recalled, with delight, the ardour with which he had fir&s;t de|clared his pa&s;&s;ion to her, and the thou|&s;and proofs he had &s;ince given of its re|ality.&mdash;From the con&s;tancy of his di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="189" REF="192">
&s;he depended a great deal, that tho&s;e &s;entiments were not totally eradi|cated; and from the extreme de&s;ire, which Mr. Sandford now, more than ever, di&s;covered to depreciate her in his patron's e&s;teem&mdash;from the now, more than common earne&s;tne&s;s, with which he never failed to take lord Elmwood from her company, whenever he had it in his power, &s;he was led to believe, that while his friend entertained &s;uch &s;trong fears of his lord&s;hip relap&s;ing into love, &s;he had rea&s;on to indulge the &s;tronge&s;t hopes that he would.</P>
<P>But the re&s;erve, and even indifference &s;he had &s;o well a&s;&s;umed for a few days, and which might perhaps have effected her de&s;igns, &s;he had not the patience to per&s;evere in, without calling levity to their aid.&mdash;She vi&s;ited repeatedly with|out
<PB N="190" REF="193">
&s;aying where, or with whom &mdash; kept later hours than u&s;ual&mdash;appear|ed in the highe&s;t &s;pirits; &s;ung, laugh'd, and never heaved a &s;igh, but when &s;he was alone.</P>
<P>Still, lord Elmwood protracted a re|&s;olution, he was determined not to break when once taken.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was extremely unea&s;y, and with cau&s;e; &s;he &s;aw her friend was providing her&s;elf with a weight of cares, &s;he would &s;oon find too much for her &s;trength to bear&mdash;&s;he would have rea|&s;oned wih her, but all her arguments had long &s;ince proved unavailing.&mdash;She &s;trongly wi&s;hed to &s;peak to lord Elm|wood upon the &s;ubject, and (unknow|ing to her) plead her excu&s;e; but he apprehended Mi&s;s Woodley's intention
<PB N="191" REF="194">
and evidently &s;hunned her.&mdash;Mr. Sand|ford was now the only per&s;on to whom &s;he could &s;peak of Mi&s;s Milner, and the delight he took to expatiate on her faults, was more &s;orrow to her friend, than not to &s;peak of her at all. She, therefore, &s;at a &s;ilent &s;pectator, waiting with dread for that time, when &s;he, who now &s;corned her advice, would fly to her in vain for comfort.</P>
<P>Sandford had, however, &s;aid one thing to Mi&s;s Woodley, which gave her a ray of hope. During their con|ver&s;ation on this &s;ubject (not by way of con&s;olation to her, but as a re|proach to lord Elmwood), he one day angrily exclaimed, "And yet, notwith|&s;tanding all this provocation, he has not come to the determination to think no more of her&mdash;he lingers and he&s;itates
<PB N="192" REF="195">
&mdash;I never &s;aw him &s;o weak upon any occa&s;ion before."</P>
<P>This was joyful hearing to Mi&s;s Woodley; &s;till, &s;he could not but re|flect, the longer he was in coming to this determination, the more irrevocable it would be, when once taken; and every moment &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he trembled le&s;t that &s;hould be the moment, in which lord Elmwood re&s;olved to bani&s;h Mi&s;s Milner from his heart.</P>
<P>Among the unpardonable indi&s;cre|tions, &s;he was guilty of during this trial upon the temper of her guardian, was the frequent mention of many gentlemen, who had been her profe&s;t admirers, and mentioning them with partiality.&mdash;Tea&s;ed, if not tortured by this, lord Elmwood &s;till behaved with a manly evenne&s;s of temper, and neither
<PB N="193" REF="196">
provoked on the &s;ubject, or in&s;olently carele&s;s.&mdash;In a &s;ingle in&s;tance, however, this calmne&s;s had nearly de&s;erted him.</P>
<P>Entering the drawing-room, one evening, he &s;uddenly &s;tarted, on &s;eeing lord Frederick Lawnly there, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton and Mi&s;s Woodley were both indeed pre&s;ent, and lord Frede|rick was talking in an audible voice, and upon &s;ome indifferent &s;ubjects; but with that impre&s;&s;ive manner, in which a man never fails to &s;peak to the woman he loves, be the &s;ubject what it will.&mdash; The moment lord Elmwood &s;tarted, which was the moment he entered, lord Frederick aro&s;e.</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, my lord," &s;aid lord Elmwood, "I prote&s;t I did not know you."</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197">"I ought to entreat your lord&s;hip's pardon," returned lord Frederick, "for this intru&s;ion, which an accident alone has occa&s;ioned. Mi&s;s Milner has been nearly overturned, by the carele&s;sne&s;s of a lady's coachman, in who&s;e carriage &s;he was, and therefore &s;uffered me to bring her home in mine."</P>
<P>"I hope you are not hurt." Said lord Elmwood to Mi&s;s Milner, but his voice was &s;o much affected, by what he felt, he could &s;carcely articulate the words.&mdash; Not with the apprehen&s;ion &s;he was hurt, was he thus agitated, for the gaiety of her manners convinced him that could not be the ca&s;e, nor did he indeed &s;uppo&s;e any accident, &s;uch as was mentioned, had occurred; but the circum&s;tance of unexpectedly &s;eeing lord Frederick had taken him off his guard, and being to|tally unprepared, he could not conquer
<PB N="195" REF="198">
tho&s;e &s;igns of &s;urpri&s;e, and the &s;hock it had given him.</P>
<P>Lord Frederick, who had heard no|thing of his intended union with his ward, (for it was even kept a &s;ecret, at pre&s;ent, from every &s;ervant in the hou&s;e) imputed this di&s;compo&s;ure, to the per&s;onal re&s;entment his lord&s;hip might bear him, in con&s;equence of their duel; for, notwith&s;tanding lord Elmwood had a&s;&s;ured the uncle of lord Frederick, (who once waited upon him on the &s;ubject of Mi&s;s Milner) that all re&s;entment was, on his part, entire|ly at an end; and that he was willing to con&s;ent to the ladies marriage with his nephew, if &s;he her&s;elf would con|cur, yet lord Frederick doubted the &s;in|cerity of this, and would &s;till have had the delicacy not to have entered lord Elmwood's hou&s;e, but, encouraged by
<PB N="196" REF="199">
Mi&s;s Milner, and emboldened by his love. Per&s;onal re&s;entment was then the con&s;truction he put upon lord Elmwood's emotion on entering the room, but Mi&s;s Milner and Mi&s;s Woodley knew his agi|tation to ari&s;e from a far different cau&s;e.</P>
<P>After his entrance, lord Frederick did not attempt to re&s;ume his &s;eat, but bow|ing mo&s;t re&s;pectfully to all pre&s;ent, took his leave; while Mi&s;s Milner followed him, as far as the door, repeating her thanks and gratitude for his protec|tion.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood was hurt beyond mea&s;ure; but he had a &s;econd concern, and that was, he had not the power to conceal how much he was affected.&mdash;He trembled&mdash;when he attempted to &s;peak, he &s;tammered &mdash; he perceived his face
<PB N="197" REF="200">
burning with the blood that had flu&s;hed to it from confu&s;ion, and thus one con|fu&s;ion gave birth to another, till his &s;tate was pitiable.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, with all her a&s;&s;umed gaiety and real in&s;olence, had not, how|ever, the in&s;olence to &s;eem to ob&s;erve his &s;ituation; &s;he had only the confidence to ob&s;erve it by &s;tealth. &mdash; And Mrs. Horton and Mi&s;s Woodley, having op|portunely begun a di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;ome trivial occurrences, gave him time to recover him&s;elf by degrees&mdash;yet, &s;till it was merely by degrees, for the impre&s;|&s;ion this incident had made, was deep, and not ea&s;ily to be era&s;ed.&mdash;The en|trance of Mr. Sandford, who knew no|thing of what had happened, was al&s;o &s;ome relief, and his lord&s;hip and he en|tered into a conver&s;ation, which they
<PB N="198" REF="201">
very &s;oon retired into the library to ter|minate. &mdash; Mi&s;s Milner, taking Mi&s;s Woodley with her, went directly to her own apartment, and there exclaimed to her friend, in rapture,</P>
<P>"He is mine&mdash;he loves me&mdash;and he is mine for ever."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley congratulated her up|on believing &s;o, but confe&s;&s;ed, &s;he her|&s;elf, "had her fears."</P>
<P>"What fears?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "don't you perceive he loves me?"</P>
<P>"I do," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "but that, I always &s;uppo&s;ed; and, I think, if he loves you now, he has &s;till the good &s;en&s;e to know, he has cau&s;e to hate you."</P>
<P>"What has good &s;en&s;e to do with love?" returned Mi&s;s Milner, "If a lover of mine &s;uffers his under&s;tanding to get the better of his affection&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="202">And the &s;ame arguments were again going to be repeated, but Mi&s;s Wood|ley interrupted her, by requiring an ex|planation of her conduct, not in re&s;pect to her guardian, but to lord Frederick; whom, at lea&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t allow, &s;he was treating with cruelty, if &s;he only made u&s;e of his affection, to &s;timulate that of lord Elmwood's.</P>
<P>"By no means, my dear Mi&s;s Wood|ley."&mdash;Returned &s;he&mdash;"I have, indeed, done with my lord Frederick from this day; and he has certainly given me the proof I wanted of lord Elmwood's love; but then, I did not engage him to this, by the &s;malle&s;t degree of hope.&mdash;No, do not &s;u&s;pect me of that, while my heart was another's.&mdash;And I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;eri|ou&s;ly, it was from the circum&s;tance we de&s;cribed, that he came with me home&mdash; yet, I mu&s;t own, that had I not had this

de&s;ign upon lord Elmwood's jealou&s;y in idea, I would have walked on foot through the &s;treets, rather than have &s;uffered his rival's civilities. &mdash; But he pre&s;&s;ed his &s;ervices &s;o violently, and my lady Evan's (in who&s;e chariot I was, when the acci|dent happened) pre&s;&s;ed me &s;o violently to accept them, that he cannot expect any farther meaning from my acquie&s;|cence, than my own convenience."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was going to reply, when &s;he re&s;umed,</P>
<P>"Nay, if you intend to &s;ay I have done wrong, &s;till I am not &s;orry for it, while it has given me &s;uch convincing proofs of lord Elmwood's love.&mdash;Did you &s;ee him? I am afraid you did not &s;ee how he trembled?&mdash;and that manly, firm voice faltered, as mine does &s;ome times&mdash;his proud heart was humbled too; as mine is &s;ome times. &mdash; Oh!
<PB N="201" REF="204">
Mi&s;s Woodley, I have been counter|feiting indifference to <HI>him</HI>; I now find all <HI>his</HI> indifference has been counterfeit too, and we not only love, but we love equally."</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;ing this, all as you hope; I yet think it highly nece&s;&s;ary, your guar|dian &s;hould be informed, &s;eriou&s;ly in|formed, that it was mere accident, (for, at pre&s;ent, that plea &s;eems but as a &s;ubterfuge) which brought lord Frede|rick hither."</P>
<P>"No, that will be de&s;troying the work &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully began.&mdash;I will not &s;uffer any explanation to take place, but let my lord Elmwood act ju&s;t as his love &s;hall dictate; and now I have no longer a doubt of its exce&s;s, in&s;tead of &s;tooping to him, I wait in the cer|tain expectation, of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to me."</P>

<P>IN vain, for three long days, did Mi&s;s Milner wait impatiently for this &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; not a &s;ign, not a &s;ymptom ap|peared&mdash;nay, lord Elmwood had, &s;ince the evening of lord Frederick's vi&s;it, (which, at the time it happened, &s;eem|ed to affect him &s;o exceedingly) become ju&s;t the &s;ame man, he was before the circum&s;tance occurred; except, indeed, &s;omething le&s;s thoughtful, and now and then cheerful; but without the &s;malle&s;t appearance, that his cheer|fulne&s;s was affected.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner was vext; &s;he was alarmed; but was a&s;hamed to confe&s;s tho&s;e humiliating &s;en&s;ations, even to Mi&s;s Woodley&mdash;&s;he a&s;&s;umed, therefore, the vivacity &s;he had
<PB N="203" REF="206">
&s;o long a&s;&s;umed, but gave way, when alone, to a &s;till greater degree of me|lancholy than u&s;ual. She no longer ap|plauded her &s;cheme of bringing lord Frederick to the hou&s;e, and trembled, le&s;t, on &s;ome pretence, he &s;hould dare to call again. But as the&s;e were feel|ings her pride would not &s;uffer her to di&s;clo&s;e to her friend, who would have condoled along with her, their effects were doubly poignant.</P>
<P>Sitting in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, one forenoon with Mi&s;s Woodley, and bur|thened with a load of grief, &s;he blu&s;h|ed to acknowledge; while her com|panion was charged with apprehen&s;ions &s;he was as loath to di&s;clo&s;e; one of lord Elmwood's valets tapped gently at the door, and delivered a letter to Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;By the per&s;on who brought
<PB N="204" REF="207">
it, as well as by the addre&s;s, &s;he knew it came from lord Elmwood, and laid it down upon her toilet, as if fearful to un|fold it.</P>
<P>"What is that?" Said Mi&s;s Wood|ley.</P>
<P>"A letter from my guardian." Re|plied Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"Good Heaven!" Exclaimed Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Nay," returned &s;he, "it is, I have no doubt, to beg my pardon." But her reluctance to open it, plainly evinced &s;he did not think &s;o."</P>
<P>"Do not read it yet." Said Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"I do not intend." Replied &s;he, trembling extremely.</P>
<P>"Will you dine fir&s;t?" Said Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="208">"No&mdash;for not knowing its contents, I &s;hall not know how to conduct my|&s;elf towards him."</P>
<P>Here a &s;ilence en&s;ued&mdash;during this &s;ilence, Mi&s;s Milner took up the letter &mdash;looked earne&s;tly at the hand-writing on the out &s;ide&mdash;at the &s;eal&mdash;in&s;pected into its folds&mdash;and &s;eemed to wi&s;h, by &s;ome equivocal method, to gue&s;s at the contents, without daring to come at the certain knowledge of them.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity, at length, got the better of her fears; &s;he opened the letter, and &s;carce able to hold it while &s;he read, read the following words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>While I con&s;idered you only as my Ward, my friend&s;hip for you was un|bounded
<PB N="206" REF="209">
&mdash;when I looked upon you as a woman formed to grace a fa&s;hion|able circle, my admiration equalled my friend&s;hip&mdash;and when fate per|mitted me to behold you in the ten|der light of my betrothed wife, my &s;oaring love left tho&s;e humbler pa&s;|&s;ions at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>That you have &s;till my friend&s;hip, my admiration, and even my love, I will not attempt to deceive either my&s;elf or you, by di&s;avowing; but &s;till, with a firm a&s;&s;urance, I declare, Prudence outweighs them all, and I have not, from henceforward, a wi&s;h to be re|garded by you in any other re&s;pect, than as one 'who wi&s;hes you well. &mdash;That you ever beheld me in the endearing quality of a de&s;tined, and an affectionate hu&s;band, (&s;uch as I
<PB N="207" REF="210">
would have proved) my hopes, my vanity, own the deception, and are humiliated&mdash;but I entreat you to &s;pare their farther trial, and for a &s;ingle week, do not in&s;ult me with the open preference of another.&mdash;In the &s;pace of that time, I &s;hall have taken my leave of you <HI>for ever.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall vi&s;it Italy, and &s;ome other countries for a few years, till I be|come once more reconciled to the change of &s;tate I am enjoined; a change, I now mo&s;t fervently wi&s;h could be entirely di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of my remaining in England a week longer, is to &s;ettle &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary affairs, but chiefly that of delivering to a friend, a man of worth and tenderne&s;s, all tho&s;e
<PB N="208" REF="211">
writings, which have inve&s;ted me with the power of my guardian&s;hip &mdash; he will, the day after my departure (with|out one upbraiding word), re&s;ign them to you in my name; and even your father, could he behold the re|&s;ignation, would concur in its pro|priety.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, let not affected re&s;entment, contempt, or levity, oppo&s;e that &s;erenity, which, for the week to come, I wi&s;h to enjoy.&mdash;By complying with this re|que&s;t, give me to believe, that &s;ince you have been under my care, you think I have, at lea&s;t, faithfully di&s;|charged &s;ome part of my duty.&mdash;And wherever I have been inadequate to your wi&s;hes, attribute my demerits to &s;ome infirmity of mind, rather
<PB N="209" REF="212">
than to a negligence of your happi|ne&s;s.&mdash;Yet, be the cau&s;e what it will, &s;ince the&s;e faults have exi&s;ted, I ac|knowledge them, and beg your par|don.</P>
<P>However, time, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects, may eradicate more tender &s;entiments; I am &s;ure <HI>never</HI> to lo&s;e the livelie&s;t anxiety for your welfare &mdash;and with all that &s;olicitude, which I cannot de&s;cribe, I entreat for your own &s;ake, for mine&mdash;when we &s;hall be far a&s;under&mdash;and for the &s;ake of your dead father's memory, <HI>call upon every important occa&s;ion, your &s;erious judgment to direct you.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="210" REF="213">After reading every &s;yllable of this letter, it dropped from Mi&s;s Milner's hands; but &s;he uttered not a word.&mdash; There was, however, a palene&s;s in her face, a deadne&s;s in her eye, and a kind of pal&s;y over her frame, which Mi&s;s Woodley, who had &s;een her in every &s;tage of her unea&s;ine&s;s, never had &s;een before.</P>
<P>"I do not want to read the letter," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "your looks tell me its contents."</P>
<P>"They will then di&s;cover to lord Elmwood," replied &s;he, "what I feel; but heaven forbid&mdash;that would &s;ink me even lower than I am."</P>
<P>Scarce able to crawl, &s;he ro&s;e, and looked in the gla&s;s, as if to arrange her features, &s;o as to impo&s;e upon him:
<PB N="211" REF="214">
alas! this was of no avail; a &s;erenity of mind, could, alone, effect what &s;he de|&s;ired.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t endeavour," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "to feel that di&s;po&s;ition, you wi&s;h to make appear."</P>
<P>"I will," replied &s;he, "I will feel a proper pride&mdash;and a proper &s;corn of this treatment."</P>
<P>And &s;o de&s;irous was &s;he to attain the appearance of the&s;e &s;entiments, &s;he made the &s;tronge&s;t efforts to calm her thoughts, in order to acquire it.</P>
<P>"I have but a few days to remain with him," &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, "and we part for ever&mdash;in tho&s;e few days, it is not only my duty to obey his com|mands, or rather comply with his re|que&s;t, but it is al&s;o my wi&s;h to leave upon his mind, an impre&s;&s;ion, which may not add to the ill opinion he has
<PB N="212" REF="215">
formed of me, but, perhaps, &s;erve to dimini&s;h it.&mdash;If, in every other in&s;tance, my conduct has been blameable, he &s;hall, at lea&s;t in this, acknowledge its merit.&mdash; The fate I have drawn upon my&s;elf, he &s;hall find I can be re&s;igned to; and he &s;hall be convinced, that the woman, of who&s;e weakne&s;s he has had &s;o many fatal proofs, is yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fortitude&mdash;fortitude to bid him farewell without di&s;covering one affected, or one real pang, though her death &s;hould be the immediate con&s;equence."</P>
<P>Thus &s;he re&s;olved, and thus &s;he acted. &mdash;The &s;evere&s;t judge could not have arraigned her conduct from the day &s;he received lord Elmwood's letter, to the day of his departure.&mdash;She had, in|deed, involuntary weakne&s;&s;es, but none with which &s;he did not &s;truggle, and
<PB N="213" REF="216">
in general her &s;truggles were victori|ous.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time &s;he &s;aw him after the receipt of his letter, was on the even|ing of the &s;ame day&mdash;&s;he had a little concert of amateurs in mu&s;ick, and was, her&s;elf, &s;inging and playing when he en|tered the room; the connoi&s;&s;eurs im|mediately perceived &s;he lo&s;t the tune, but lord Elmwood was no connoi&s;&s;eur in the art, and did not ob&s;erve it.</P>
<P>They occa&s;ionally &s;poke to each other during the evening, but the &s;ubjects were general&mdash;and though their manners every time they &s;poke were perfectly polite, they were not tinctured with the &s;malle&s;t degree of familiarity.&mdash;To de&s;cribe his behaviour exactly, it was the &s;ame as his letter, polite, friendly, compo&s;ed,
<PB N="214" REF="217">
and re&s;olved.&mdash;Some of the company &s;taid &s;upper, which prevented the em|barra&s;&s;ment that mu&s;t unavoidably have ari&s;en, had the family been by them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The next morning each breakfa&s;ted in their &s;eparate apartments &mdash; more company dined with them, and in the evening, and at &s;upper, lord Elmwood was from home.</P>
<P>Thus all pa&s;&s;ed on as peaceably as he had reque&s;ted, and Mi&s;s Milner had not betrayed one particle of frailty; when, the third day at dinner, &s;ome gentlemen of his acquaintance being at table, one of them &s;aid,</P>
<P>"And &s;o, my lord, you ab&s;olutely &s;et off on Tue&s;day morning?"</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="218">This was Friday.</P>
<P>Sandford and he both replied at the &s;ame time, "Yes." And Sandford, but not lord Elmwood, looked at Mi&s;s Mil|ner when he &s;poke.&mdash;Her knife and fork gave a &s;udden &s;pring in her hand, but no other emotion witne&s;&s;ed what &s;he felt.</P>
<P>"Ay, Elmwood," cried another gen|tleman at table, "you'll bring home, I am afraid, a foreign wife, and that I &s;han't forgive."</P>
<P>"It is his errand abroad, I make no doubt." Said another vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>Before his lord&s;hip could return an an&s;wer, Sandford cried, "And what objection to a foreigner for a wife? do not crowned heads all marry foreigners? and who happier in the marriage &s;tate than &s;ome kings?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood directed his eyes to the &s;ide of the table, oppo&s;ite to that where Mi&s;s Milner &s;at.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="219">"Nay," (an&s;wered one of the gue&s;ts, who was a country gentleman) "what do you &s;ay, ladies&mdash;do you think my lord ought to go out of his own nation for a wife?" And he looked at Mi&s;s Milner, for the reply.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, unea&s;y at her friend's being thus forced to give an opinion upon &s;o delicate a &s;ubject, endeavoured to &s;atisfy the gentleman, by an&s;wering to the que&s;tion her&s;elf: "Whoever my lord Elmwood marries, Sir," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "he, no doubt, will be happy."</P>
<P>"But what &s;ay you, young lady?" A&s;ked the gentleman, &s;till keeping his eyes on Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"That whoever his lord&s;hip marries, he <HI>de&s;erves</HI> to be happy." Returned &s;he, with the utmo&s;t command of her voice and looks; for Mi&s;s Woodley,
<PB N="217" REF="220">
by replying fir&s;t, had given her time to collect her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The colour flew to lord Elmwood's face, as &s;he delivered this &s;hort &s;en|tence; and Mi&s;s Woodley flattered her|&s;elf, &s;he &s;aw a tear &s;tart in his eye.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner did not look that way.</P>
<P>In an in&s;tant his lord&s;hip found means to change the &s;ubject, but that of his journey, &s;till employed the conver&s;a|tion; and what hor&s;es, &s;ervants, and carriage he took with him, was mi|nutely a&s;ked, and &s;o accurately an|&s;wered either by him&s;elf or by Mr. Sandford, that Mi&s;s Milner, although &s;he had beheld her doom before, till now had received no circum&s;tantial ac|count of it&mdash;and as circum&s;tances add to, or dimini&s;h all we feel, hearing the&s;e things told, encrea&s;ed the bitterne&s;s of their truth.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="221">Soon after dinner, the ladies retired, and from that time, though Mi&s;s Mil|ner's behaviour &s;till continued the fame, yet her looks and her voice were totally altered&mdash;for the world, &s;he could not have looked cheerfully; for the world, &s;he could not have &s;poken with a &s;prightly accent; &s;he frequently began in one, but not three words had &s;he uttered, be|fore her tones &s;unk into the flatte&s;t de|jection.&mdash;Not only her colour, but her features became changed; her eyes lo&s;t their brilliancy, her lips &s;eemed to hang without the power of motion, her head drooped, and her dre&s;s was wholly neglected.&mdash;Con&s;cious of this di&s;tre&s;t appearance, and con&s;cious of the weakne&s;s from whence it aro&s;e, it was her de&s;ire to hide her&s;elf from the only object &s;he could have wi&s;hed
<PB N="219" REF="222">
to have charmed. &mdash; Accordingly, &s;he &s;at alone, or with Mi&s;s Woodley in her own apartment, as much as was con&s;i&s;tent with that civility her guar|dian had reque&s;ted, and which for|bade her from totally ab&s;enting her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley felt &s;o acutely the torments of her friend, that had not her rea&s;on told her the inflexible mind of lord Elmwood was fixed beyond her power to &s;hake, &s;he had ca&s;t her&s;elf at his feet, and implored the return of his affection and tenderne&s;s as the only means to &s;ave his once beloved ward from an untimely grave. But her un|der&s;tanding &mdash; her knowledge of lord Elmwood's firm and immoveable tem|per; and all his grievous provocations &mdash;her knowledge of his word, long &s;ince
<PB N="220" REF="223">
given to Sandford, "That if once re|&s;olved, he would not recall his re&s;olu|tion."&mdash;The certainty of the many plans that had been arranged for his travels, all agreed to convince her, that by any interference, &s;he only expo&s;ed Mi&s;s Mil|ner's tendere&s;t love and delicacy to a contemptuous rejection.</P>
<P>If the conver&s;ation did not every day turn upon the &s;ubject of lord Elmwood's departure&mdash;a conver&s;ation he evidently avoided him&s;elf&mdash;yet every day &s;ome new preparation for his journey, &s;truck the ear or the eye of Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;and had &s;he beheld a frightful &s;pectre, &s;he could not have &s;huddered with more horror, than when &s;he unexpectedly pa&s;|&s;ed his large trunks in the hall, nailed and corded, ready to be &s;ent off to meet him at Venice.&mdash;At the &s;ight, &s;he flew
<PB N="221" REF="224">
from the company that happened to be along with her, and &s;tole to the fir&s;t lonely corner of the hou&s;e to conceal her tears&mdash;&s;he reclined her head upon her hands, and bedewed them with the &s;udden angui&s;h that had overcome her. &mdash;She heard a foot&s;tep advancing to|wards the &s;pot where &s;he hoped to have been concealed; &s;he lifted up her eyes, and beheld lord Elmwood.&mdash;Pride was the fir&s;t emotion his pre&s;ence in&s;pired&mdash; pride, which aro&s;e from the humility into which &s;he was plunged.</P>
<P>She in&s;tantly &s;tifled her tears, and looked at him earne&s;tly, as if to imply, "What now, my lord?"</P>
<P>He only an&s;wered with a bow, which expre&s;&s;ed the&s;e words alone: "I beg your pardon." And immediately withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="225">Thus each under&s;tood the other's lan|guage, without either uttering a word.</P>
<P>The ju&s;t con&s;truction, which &s;he put upon his looks and behaviour upon this occa&s;ion, kept up her &s;pirits for &s;ome little time; and &s;he ble&s;&s;ed heaven, re|peatedly, for the &s;ingular favour of &s;hew|ing to her, clearly, by this accident, his negligence of her &s;orrows, his total indifference.</P>
<P>The next day was the eve of that, on which he was to depart&mdash;and the one on which &s;he was to bid adieu to Dorriforth, to her guardian, to lord Elmwood; to all her hopes at once.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he awoke on Monday morning, the recollection, that this was,
<PB N="223" REF="226">
perhaps, the la&s;t day &s;he was ever again to &s;ee him, &s;oftened all the re&s;entment his ye&s;terday's conduct had given birth to, and forgetting his au&s;terity, and all &s;he once termed, cruelties; &s;he now only remembered his friend&s;hip, his anxious tenderne&s;s, and his love.&mdash; She was impatient to behold him, and promi&s;ed to her&s;elf, for this la&s;t day, to neglect no one opportunity of being with him. For that purpo&s;e &s;he did not breakfa&s;t in her own room, as &s;he had done for &s;everal mornings before, but went into the breakfa&s;t-room, where all the family generally met. &mdash; She was rejoiced on hearing his voice as &s;he opened the door, yet the &s;ound made her tremble &s;o much, &s;he could &s;carcely totter to the table.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="227">Mi&s;s Woodley looked at her as &s;he entered, and was never &s;o &s;hocked at &s;eeing her; for never had &s;he yet &s;een her look &s;o ill.&mdash;As &s;he approached, &s;he made an inclination of her head to Mrs. Horton, and then to her guardian, as was her cu&s;tom, when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw them in a morning&mdash;his lord&s;hip looked in her face as he bowed, then turned his eyes upon the fire place, rubbed his forehead, and began talking with Mr. Sandford.</P>
<P>Sandford, during breakfa&s;t, by acci|dent, ca&s;t his eyes upon Mi&s;s Milner; his attention was caught by her deathly countenance, and he looked earne&s;tly. &mdash;He then turned to lord Elmwood to &s;ee if he was ob&s;erving her appearance &mdash; he was not &mdash; and &s;o much were her
<PB N="225" REF="228">
thoughts engaged on him alone, &s;he did not once perceive Sandford gazing at her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton after a little while ob|&s;erved, "It was a beautiful morning."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;aid, "He thought he heard it rain in the night."</P>
<P>Sandford cried, "For his part he &s;lept too well to know." And then (un|a&s;ked) held a plate with bui&s;cuits to Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;it was the fir&s;t civility he had ever in his life offered her; &s;he &s;miled at the whim&s;icality of the cir|cum&s;tance, but took one in return for his attention.&mdash;He looked grave be|yond his u&s;ual gravity, and yet not with his u&s;ual ill temper. She did not eat what &s;he had &s;o politely taken, but laid it down &s;oon after.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="229">Lord Elmwood was the fir&s;t who ro&s;e from breakfa&s;t, and did not return to dinner.</P>
<P>At dinner, Mrs. Horton &s;aid, "She hoped his lord&s;hip would, however, fa|vour them with his company at &s;up|per."</P>
<P>To which Sandford replied, "No doubt, for you will hardly any of you &s;ee him in the morning; as we &s;hall be off by &s;ix, or &s;oon after."</P>
<P>Sandford was not going abroad with lord Elmwood, but was to go with him as far as Dover.</P>
<P>The&s;e words of his&mdash;"<HI>not &s;ee lord Elm|wood in the morning</HI>"&mdash;[never again to &s;ee him after this evening,] were like the knell of death to Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;She felt the &s;ymptoms of fainting, and eagerly &s;natched a gla&s;s of wine, which the &s;er|vant

was holding to Sandford, (who had called for wine) and drank a part of it.&mdash; As &s;he returned the gla&s;s to the &s;ervant, &s;he began to apologize to Mr. Sandford for her &s;eeming rudene&s;s, but before &s;he could utter what &s;he meant, he &s;aid, good-naturedly, "Never mind &mdash; you are very welcome&mdash;I am glad you took it."&mdash;She looked at him to ob&s;erve, whether he had really &s;poken kindly, or ironically; but before his countenance could &s;atisfy her, her thoughts were away from that trivial circum&s;tance, and again fixed upon lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>The moments &s;eemed tedious till he came home to &s;upper, and yet, when &s;he reflected for how &s;hort a time the re&s;t of the evening would continue, &s;he wi&s;hed to defer the hour of his return, for months.&mdash;At ten o'clock he arrived,
<PB N="228" REF="231">
and at half after ten the family, without any vi&s;itor, met at &s;upper.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had con&s;idered, that the period for her to counterfeit appear|ances, was dimini&s;hed now to a very &s;hort one; and &s;he rigourou&s;ly enjoin|ed her&s;elf not to &s;hrink from that little which remained.&mdash;The certain end, that would be &s;o &s;oon put to this painful deception, encouraged her to &s;truggle through it with redoubled zeal; and this was but nece&s;&s;ary, as her weakne&s;s encrea&s;ed.&mdash;She therefore li&s;tened, &s;he talked, and even &s;miled with the re&s;t of the company, nor did their vivacity &s;eem to ari&s;e from a much le&s;s com|pul&s;ive &s;ource than her own.</P>
<P>It was pa&s;t twelve, when lord Elm|wood looked at his watch, and ri&s;ing
<PB N="229" REF="232">
from his &s;eat, went up to Mrs. Horton, and taking her hand, &s;aid, "Till I &s;ee you again, madam, I &s;incerely wi&s;h you every happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner fixed her eyes upon the table before her.</P>
<P>"My lord," replied Mrs. Horton, "I &s;incerely wi&s;h you health and hap|pine&s;s likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>He then went to Mi&s;s Woodley, and taking her hand, repeated much the &s;ame, as he had &s;aid to Mrs. Horton.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner now trembled beyond all power of concealment.</P>
<P>"My lord," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, a good deal affected, "I &s;incerely hope my prayers for your happine&s;s may be heard."</P>
<P>She and Mrs. Horton were both &s;tanding as well as his lord&s;hip; but
<PB N="230" REF="233">
Mi&s;s Milner kept her &s;eat, till his eye was turned upon her, and he moved &s;lowly towards her; &s;he then ro&s;e&mdash;and every one who was pre&s;ent attentive to what he would now &s;ay, and how &s;he would receive what he &s;aid, ca&s;t their eyes upon them, and li&s;tened with impa|tience.&mdash;They were all di&s;appointed&mdash; he did not utter a &s;yllable.&mdash;Yet he took her hand, and held it clo&s;ely between his. &mdash;He then bowed mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, and left her.</P>
<P>No, "I wi&s;h you well;&mdash;I wi&s;h you health and happine&s;s." No "Prayers for ble&s;&s;ings on her." &mdash; Not even the word "farewell," e&s;caped his lips&mdash;per|haps, to have attempted any of the&s;e, might have choaked his utterance.</P>
<P>She had behaved with fortitude the whole evening, and &s;he continued to
<PB N="231" REF="234">
do &s;o, till the moment he turned away from her.&mdash;Her eyes then overflowed with tears, and in the agony of her mind, not knowing what &s;he did, &s;he laid her cold hand upon the per&s;on next to her&mdash; it happened to be Sandford; but not ob&s;erving it was him, &s;he gra&s;ped his hand with violence &mdash; yet he did not &s;natch it away, nor look at her with his wonted &s;everity. &mdash; And thus &s;he &s;tood, &s;ilent and motionle&s;s, while his lord&s;hip lighted a candle, he took from the &s;ide-board, bowed once more to all the company, and retired.</P>
<P>Sandford had &s;till Mi&s;s Milner's hand fixed upon his; and when the door was &s;hut after lord Elmwood, he turned his head to look in her face, and turned it with &s;ome marks of apprehen&s;ion for the grief he might find there. &mdash; She
<PB N="232" REF="235">
&s;trove to overcome that grief, and after a heavy &s;igh, &s;at down, as if re&s;igned to the fate to which &s;he was decreed.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of following lord Elmwood, as u&s;ual, Sandford poured out a gla&s;s of wine, and drank it.&mdash;A general &s;ilence en&s;ued for near three minutes.&mdash;At la&s;t turning him&s;elf round on his &s;eat, to|wards Mi&s;s Milner, who &s;at like a &s;ta|tue of de&s;pair at his &s;ide, "Will you breakfa&s;t with us to-morrow?" Said he.</P>
<P>She made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"We &s;han't breakfa&s;t before half af|ter &s;ix," continued he, "I dare &s;ay; and if you can ri&s;e &s;o early&mdash;why do."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, (for &s;he caught, eagerly, at the hope of her pa&s;&s;ing this night in le&s;s unhappi|ne&s;s than &s;he had foreboded) "pray
<PB N="233" REF="236">
ri&s;e at that hour to breakfa&s;t; Mr. Sand|would not invite you, if he thought it would di&s;plea&s;e his lord&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Not I." Replied Sandford, chur|li&s;hly.</P>
<P>"Then de&s;ire her woman to call her." Said Mrs. Horton to Mi&s;s Wood|ley.</P>
<P>"Nay, &s;he will be awake, I have no doubt." Returned her niece.</P>
<P>"No;" replied Mi&s;s Milner, "&s;ince lord Elmwood has thought proper to take his leave of me, without even &s;peaking a word; by my own de&s;ign, never will I &s;ee him again." And here a flood of tears bur&s;t forth, as if her heart bur&s;t at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>"Why did not <HI>you</HI> &s;peak to <HI>him?</HI>" cried Sandford &mdash; "pray did you bid <HI>him</HI> farewell? &mdash; and I don't &s;ee why
<PB N="234" REF="237">
one is not as much to be blamed, in that re&s;pect, as the other."</P>
<P>"I was too weak to &s;ay, I wi&s;hed him happy;" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "but, hea|ven is my witne&s;s, I do wi&s;h him &s;o from my &s;oul."</P>
<P>"And do you imagine, he does not wi&s;h you &s;o too?" cried Sandford.&mdash; "You &s;hould judge him by your own heart; and what you feel for him, ima|gine he feels for you, my dear."</P>
<P>Though "<HI>my dear</HI>" is a trivial phra&s;e, yet from certain people, and upon certain occa&s;ions, it is a phra&s;e of infinite comfort and a&s;&s;urance. &mdash; Mr. Sandford &s;eldom &s;aid "my dear" to any one; to Mi&s;s Milner never; and upon this occa&s;ion, and from him, it was an expre&s;&s;ion mo&s;t precious.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="238">She turned to him with a look of gratitude; but as &s;he only looked, and did not &s;peak, he ro&s;e up, and &s;oon af|ter &s;aid, with a friendly tone he had &s;eldom &s;poken with in her pre&s;ence, "I &s;incerely wi&s;h you a good night."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, Mi&s;s Mil|ner exclaimed, "However my fate may have been precipitated by the unkind|ne&s;s of Mr. Sandford, yet, for that par|ticle of concern he has &s;hown for me this night, I will always be grateful to him."</P>
<P>"Ay," cried Mrs. Horton, "good Mr. Sandford may &s;how his kindne&s;s now, without any danger from its con|&s;equences.&mdash;Now his lord&s;hip is going away for ever, he is not afraid of your &s;eeing him once again." And &s;he thought &s;he prai&s;ed him by this &s;ug|ge&s;tion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mi&s;s Milner retired to her bed-chamber, Mi&s;s Woodley went with her, nor would leave her the whole night&mdash;but in vain did &s;he per&s;uade her to go to re&s;t, &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and declared &s;he would never, from that hour, indulge the &s;malle&s;t repo&s;e. &mdash; "The part I undertook to perform," cried &s;he, "is over; I will now, for my whole life, appear in my own character, and give a loo&s;e to the angui&s;h I en|dure."</P>
<P>As day light &s;howed it&s;elf, "And yet I might &s;ee him once again." Said &s;he. "I might &s;ee him within the&s;e two hours, if I plea&s;ed, for Mr. Sand|ford invited me."</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="240">"If you think, my dear Mi&s;s Mil|ner," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "that a &s;e|cond parting from lord Elmwood, would but give you a &s;econd agony, in the name of heaven do not &s;ee him any more &mdash;but, if you think your mind would be ea&s;ier, were you to bid each other adieu in a more direct manner than you did la&s;t night, let us go down and breakfa&s;t with him.&mdash;I'll go before, to prepare him for your reception&mdash;you &s;hall not unexpectedly &s;urpri&s;e him&mdash;and I will let him know, it is by Mr. Sandford's invitation you are coming."</P>
<P>She li&s;tened with a &s;mile to this pro|po&s;al, yet objected to the indelicacy of her wi&s;hing to &s;ee him, after he had taken his leave&mdash;but as Mi&s;s Wood|ley, neverthele&s;s, perceived &s;he was in|clined to infringe this delicacy, of which &s;he had &s;o proper a &s;en&s;e, &s;he ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded
<PB N="238" REF="241">
her, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious per&s;on (and lord Elm|wood was far from &s;uch a character) to &s;uppo&s;e, that by paying him a vi&s;it at that period of time, could be with the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of regaining his heart, or of altering one re&s;olution he had taken.</P>
<P>In this opinion, Mi&s;s Milner acqui|e&s;ced, yet &s;he had not the courage to come to the determination &s;he would go.</P>
<P>Day light now no longer peeped, but &s;tared broad upon them.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner went to the looking-gla&s;s, breathed upon her hands and rubbed them on her eyes; put &s;ome powder into her hair; yet &s;aid, after all, "I dare not &s;ee him again."</P>
<P>"You may do as you plea&s;e," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "but I will. I that
<PB N="239" REF="242">
have lived for &s;o many years under the &s;ame roof with him, and on the mo&s;t friendly terms, and he going away, perhaps for the&s;e ten years, perhaps for ever; I &s;hould think it a di&s;re&s;pect not to &s;ee him to the la&s;t moment of his remaining in the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then do you go," &s;aid Mi&s;s Mil|ner, eagerly, "and if he &s;hould a&s;k for me, I will gladly come, you know; but if he does not a&s;k for me, I will not&mdash; and pray do not deceive me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley gave her her word not to deceive her; and &s;oon after, as they heard the &s;ervants pa&s;s about the hou&s;e, and the clock had &s;truck &s;ix, Mi&s;s Woodley went to the breakfa&s;t-room.</P>
<P>She found lord Elmwood there in his travelling dre&s;s, &s;tanding pen&s;ively by the fire place&mdash;and, as he did not dream of
<PB N="240" REF="243">
&s;eeing her, he &s;tarted when &s;he entered, and with an appearance of alarm &s;aid, "Dear Mi&s;s Woodley, what's the mat|ter?" &mdash; She replied, "Nothing, my lord; but I could not be &s;atisfied with|out &s;eeing your lord&s;hip once again, while I had it in my power."</P>
<P>"I thank you." He returned with a &s;igh, and the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t in|telligent &s;igh, &s;he ever heard him con|de&s;cend to give.&mdash;She imagined, al&s;o, he looked as if he wi&s;hed to a&s;k how Mi&s;s Milner did, but would not allow him&s;elf the indulgence.&mdash;She was half inclined to mention her to him, and debating in her mind whether &s;he &s;hould or not, Mr. Sandford came into the room; &s;aying, as he entered,</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, my lord, where did you &s;leep la&s;t night?"</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="244">"Why do you a&s;k?" Said his lord|&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e," replied Sandford, "I went into your bed-chamber but now, and I found your bed made.&mdash;You have not &s;lept there to-night."</P>
<P>"I have &s;lept no where;" an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "I could not &s;leep&mdash;and having &s;ome papers to look over, and to ri&s;e early, I thought I might as well not go to bed at all."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was plea&s;ed at the frank manner in which he made this confe&s;&s;ion, and could not re&s;i&s;t the &s;trong impul&s;e to &s;ay, "You have done ju&s;t then, my lord, like Mi&s;s Milner, for &s;he has not been in bed the whole night."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;poke this in a neg|ligent manner, and yet, lord Elmwood echoed back the words with &s;olici|tude
<PB N="242" REF="245">
and tenderne&s;s, "Has not Mi&s;s Milner been in bed the whole night?"</P>
<P>"If &s;he is up, why does not &s;he come and take &s;ome coffee?" Said Sandford, as he began to pour it out.</P>
<P>"If &s;he thought it would be agree|able," returned Mi&s;s Woodley, "I dare &s;ay &s;he would." And &s;he looked at lord Elmwood while &s;he &s;poke, though &s;he did not ab&s;olutely addre&s;s him; but he made no reply.</P>
<P>"Agreeable!" returned Sandford, an|grily, "Has &s;he then a quarrel with any body here? or does &s;he &s;uppo&s;e any body here bears enmity to <HI>her?</HI>&mdash;Is &s;he not in peace and charity?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "that I am &s;ure &s;he is."</P>
<P>"Then bring her hither," (&s;aid he) "directly.&mdash;Would &s;he have the wick|edne&s;s
<PB N="243" REF="246">
to imagine we are not all friends with her?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley left the room, and found Mi&s;s Milner almo&s;t in de&s;pair, left &s;he &s;hould hear lord Elmwood's carriage drive off before her friend's re|turn.</P>
<P>"Did he &s;end for me?" were the words &s;he uttered as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw her.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford did, in his pre&s;ence," returned Mi&s;s Woodley, "and you may go with the utmo&s;t decorum, or I would not tell you &s;o."</P>
<P>She required no prote&s;tations of this, but readily followed her beloved advi&s;er, who&s;e kindne&s;s never appeared in half the amiable light as at that moment.</P>
<P>On entering the room, through all the dead white of her pre&s;ent complex|ion,
<PB N="244" REF="247">
&s;he blu&s;hed to a crim&s;on.&mdash;Lord Elmwood ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and brought a chair for her to &s;it down.</P>
<P>Sandford looked at her inqui&s;itively, then &s;ipped his tea, and &s;aid, "He ne|ver made tea to his own liking."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner took a cup, but had &s;carce &s;trength to hold it.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed but a very &s;hort time they were at breakfa&s;t, when the carriage, that was to take his lord&s;hip away, drove to the door.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner &s;tarted at the &s;ound; &s;o did he; but &s;he had nearly dropped her cup and &s;aucer: on which Sandford took them out of her hand, &s;aying,</P>
<P>"Perhaps you had rather have cof|fee?"</P>
<P>Her lips moved, but he could not hear what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="248">A &s;ervant came in, and told lord Elmwood, "The carriage was at the door."</P>
<P>He replied, "Very well." But though he had breakfa&s;ted, he did not attempt to move.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, ri&s;ing bri&s;kly from his &s;eat, as if it was nece&s;&s;ary to go in ha&s;te, when he did go; he took up his hat, which he had brought with him into the room, and was turning to Mi&s;s Wood|ley to take his leave, when Sandford cried, "My lord, you are in a great hurry."&mdash;And then, as if he wi&s;hed to give poor Mi&s;s Milner every moment he could, added, (looking about) "I don't know where I have laid my gloves."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip, after repeating to Mi&s;s Woodley his la&s;t night's farewell, now
<PB N="246" REF="249">
went up to Mi&s;s Milner, and taking one of her hands, again held it be|tween his, but &s;till without &s;peaking&mdash; while &s;he, unable to &s;uppre&s;s her tears as heretofore, &s;uffered them to fall in torrents.</P>
<P>"What is all this?" Cried Sandford, going up to them in anger.</P>
<P>They neither of them replied, or changed their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"Seperate this moment." &mdash; Cried Sandford &mdash; "Or re&s;olve never to be &s;eparated but by death."</P>
<P>The commanding, and awful manner in which he &s;poke this &s;entence, made them both turn to him in amazement! and almo&s;t petrified with the &s;en&s;ation his words had cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>He left them for a moment, and go|ing to a &s;mall book-ca&s;e in one corner of the room, took out of it a book,
<PB N="247" REF="250">
and returning with it in his hand, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood, do you love this woman?"</P>
<P>"More than my life." Replied his lord&s;hip, with the mo&s;t heartfelt ac|cents.</P>
<P>He then turned to Mi&s;s Milner&mdash; "Can you &s;ay the &s;ame by him?"</P>
<P>She &s;pread her hands over her eyes, and cried, "Oh, heavens!"</P>
<P>"I believe you <HI>can</HI> &s;ay &s;o;" returned Sandford, "and in the name of God, and your own happine&s;s, &s;ince this is the ca&s;e, let me put it out of your power to part."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood gazed at him with wonder! and yet, as if enraptured by the &s;udden appearance of a change in his pro&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="251">She, &s;ighed with a trembling kind of extacy; while Sandford, with all the pomp and dignity of a clergyman in his official character, delivered the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"My lord, while I thought my coun|&s;el might &s;ave you from the wor&s;t of misfortunes, conjugal &s;trife, I impor|tuned you hourly; and &s;et forth your danger in the light it appeared to me.&mdash; But though old, and a prie&s;t, I can &s;ub|mit to think I have been in an error; and I now firmly believe, it is for the welfare of you both, to become man and wife.&mdash;My lord, take this woman's marriage vows; you can a&s;k no fairer promi&s;es of her reform; &s;he can give you none half &s;o &s;acred, half &s;o binding; and I &s;ee by her looks &s;he will mean to keep them.&mdash;And my dear," continued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her, "act but
<PB N="249" REF="252">
under the dominion of tho&s;e vows, to a hu&s;band of &s;en&s;e and virtue, like him, and you will be all that I, him&s;elf, or even heaven can de&s;ire.&mdash;Now then, lord Elmwood, this moment give her up for ever; or this moment con&s;train her by &s;uch ties from offending you, &s;he &s;hall not <HI>dare</HI> to violate."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;truck his forehead in doubt and agitation; but &s;till hold|ing her hand, he cried, "I cannot part from her."&mdash;Then feeling this reply as equivocal, he fell upon his knees, and cried, "Will you pardon my he&s;itation?&mdash;and will you, in mar|riage, &s;how me that tender love you have not &s;hown me yet?&mdash;will you, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all my affections, bear with all my infirmities?"</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="253">She rai&s;ed him from her feet, and by the expre&s;&s;ion of her face, the tears with which &s;he bathed his hands, gave him confidence.</P>
<P>He turned to Sandford&mdash;then place|ing her by his own &s;ide, as the form of matrimony requires, gave this as a &s;ign for Sandford to begin the ceremony.&mdash; On which, he opened his book, and&mdash; married them.</P>
<P>While with a countenance&mdash;manner &mdash;and voice, &s;o &s;erious, and &s;o fervent, did he perform the&s;e rites, that the idea of je&s;t, or even of lightne&s;s, was far from the mind of every one pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, covered with &s;hame, &s;unk on the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>When the ring was wanting, lord Elmwood &s;upplied it with one from his own hand, but throughout all the re&s;t of
<PB N="251" REF="254">
the ceremony, appeared lo&s;t in zealous devotion to heaven. &mdash; Yet, no &s;ooner was it fini&s;hed; than his thoughts &s;eemed to de&s;cend to this world.&mdash;He embraced his bride with all the tran&s;|port of the fonde&s;t, happie&s;t bride|groom, and in raptures called her by the endearing name of, "wife."</P>
<P>"But &s;till, my lord," cried Sand|ford, "you are only married by your own church and con&s;cience, not by your wife's; or by the law of the land; and let me advi&s;e you not to defer that mar|riage long, le&s;t in the time you di&s;|agree, and &s;he yet refu&s;e to become your legal &s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>"I think there is danger," returned his lord&s;hip, "and therefore our &s;econd marriage mu&s;t take place to-morrow."</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="255">To this the ladies objected, and it was left to Sandford to fix their &s;econd wedding-day, as he had done their fir&s;t. &mdash; He, after con&s;ideration, gave four days interval.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley then recollected (for every one el&s;e had forgot it) that the carriage was &s;till at the door to convey lord Elmwood abroad.&mdash;It was of cour&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed&mdash;and one of tho&s;e great inci|dents of delight Mi&s;s Milner that morn|ing ta&s;ted, was to look out of the win|dow, and &s;ee this very carriage drive from the door unoccupied.</P>
<P>Never was there a more rapid change from de&s;pair to happine&s;s&mdash;to happine&s;s mo&s;t &s;upreme&mdash;than was that, which Mi&s;s Milner, and lord Elmwood expe|rienced within one &s;ingle hour.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="256">The few days that intervened be|tween this and their legal marriage, were pa&s;&s;ed in the delightful care of preparing for that happy day &mdash; yet, with all its delights inferior to the fir&s;t; when every joy was doubled by the expected &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, on that fir&s;t wedding-day, that joyful day, which re&s;tored her lo&s;t lover to her hopes again; even on that <HI>very</HI> day, after the &s;acred ceremony was over, Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;(with all the fears, the tremors, the &s;uper&s;tition of her &s;ex)&mdash;felt an excruciating &s;hock; when, looking on the ring lord Elmwood had put upon her finger, in ha&s;te, when he married her, &s;he perceived it was a&mdash; MOURNING RING.</P>
