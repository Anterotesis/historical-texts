<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the great improvements that have been made in Navigation &s;ince the di&s;covery of America, it may well be thought &s;trange that a very con&s;iderable part of the globe on which we live &s;hould &s;till have remain|ed unknown; that it &s;hould &s;till have been the &s;ubject of &s;peculation, whether a great portion of the Southern Hemi&s;phere is land or water; and, even where land had been di&s;covered, that
<PB REF="3">
neither its extent nor figure &s;hould have been a&s;certained. But the cau&s;e has probably been, that &s;overeign Princes have &s;eldom any other motive for attempting the di&s;covery of new countries than to conquer them, that the ad|vantages of conquering countries which mu&s;t fir&s;t be di&s;covered are remote and uncertain, and that ambition has always found objects nearer home.</P>
<P>It is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of Your Maje&s;ty to act from more liberal motives; and having the be&s;t fleet, and the brave&s;t as well as mo&s;t able navigators in Europe, Your Maje&s;ty has, not with a view to the acqui&s;ition of trea&s;ure, or the extent of dominion, but the improvement of commerce and the increa&s;e and diffu&s;ion of knowlege, undertaken what has &s;o long been neglected; and under Your Maje&s;ty's au&s;pices, in little more than &s;even years, di&s;coveries have been made far greater than tho&s;e of all the navigators in the world
<PB REF="4">
collectively, from the expedition of Columbus to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>To have been appointed to record them, and permitted to in&s;cribe the narrative to Your Maje&s;ty, is an honour, the &s;en&s;e of which will always be retained with the warme&s;t gratitude, by</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty, &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, formed a de&s;ign of &s;ending out ve&s;&s;els for making di&s;coveries of countries hitherto unknown, and in the year 1764, the kingdom being then in a &s;tate of profound peace, he proceeded to put it into execution. The Dolphin and the Tamar were di&s;patched under the command of Commo|dore Byron, and the be&s;t account of his Maje&s;ty's motives and de&s;ign that can be given, will be found in the following preamble to Commodore Byron's in&s;tructions, which are dated the 17th of June in that year.</P>
<P><Q>Whereas nothing can redound more to the honour of this nation, as a maritime power, to the dignity of the Crown of Great Britain, and to the advancement of the trade and navigation thereof, than to make di&s;coveries of countries hitherto unknown; and whereas there is rea&s;on to believe that lands and i&s;lands of great extent, hitherto unvi&s;ited by any European power, may be found in the Atlantic Ocean, between the Cape of Good Hope and the Magellanic Streight, within the latitudes convenient for na|vigation, and in climates adapted to the produce of com|modities u&s;eful in commerce; and whereas his Maje&s;ty's i&s;lands called Pepys' I&s;land, and Falkland's I&s;lands, lying within the &s;aid tract, notwith&s;tanding their having been fir&s;t di&s;covered and vi&s;ited by Briti&s;h navigators, have never yet been &s;o &s;ufficiently &s;urveyed as that an accurate judgment may be formed of their coa&s;ts and product; his
<PB N="ii" REF="14">
Maje&s;ty taking the premi&s;es into con&s;ideration, and con|ceiving no conjuncture &s;o proper for an enterprize of this nature, as a time of profound peace, which his kingdoms at pre&s;ent happily enjoy, has thought fit that it &s;hould now be undertaken.</Q></P>
<P>The Dolphin was a man of war of the &s;ixth rate, mounting twenty-four guns: her complement was 150 men, with three Lieutenants, and thirty-&s;even petty officers.</P>
<P>The Tamar was a &s;loop, mounting &s;ixteen guns: her com|plement was ninety men, with three Lieutenants, and two and twenty petty officers, and the command of her was given to Captain Mouat.</P>
<P>Commodore Byron returned in the month of May in the year 1766, and in the month of Augu&s;t following, the Dolphin was again &s;ent out, under the command of Captain Wallis, with the Swallow, commanded by Captain Carteret, in pro|&s;ecution of the &s;ame general de&s;ign of making di&s;coveries in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere. The equipment of the Dolphin was the &s;ame as before. The Swallow was a &s;loop mount|ing fourteen guns; her complement was ninety men, with one Lieutenant, and twenty-two petty officers.</P>
<P>The&s;e ve&s;&s;els proceeded together till they came within &s;ight of the South Sea, at the we&s;tern entrance of the Streight of Magellan, and from thence returned by different routs to England.</P>
<P>In the latter part of the year 1767, it was re&s;olved, by the Royal Society, that it would be proper to &s;end per&s;ons into &s;ome part of the South Sea to ob&s;erve a tran&s;it of the planet Venus over the &s;un's di&s;k, which, according to a&s;trono|mical calculation, would happen in the year 1769; and that the i&s;lands called Marque&s;as de Mendoza, or tho&s;e of Rotter|dam
<PB N="iii" REF="15">
or Am&s;terdam, were the propere&s;t places then known for making &s;uch ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e re&s;olutions, it was recommended to his Maje&s;ty, in a memorial from the Society, dated Fe|bruary 1768, that he would be plea&s;ed to order &s;uch an ob|&s;ervation to be made; upon which his Maje&s;ty &s;ignified to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty his plea&s;ure that a &s;hip &s;hould be provided to carry &s;uch ob&s;ervers as the Society &s;hould think fit to the South Seas; and in the beginning of April following the Society received a letter from the Secre|tary of the Admiralty, informing them that a bark of three hundred and &s;eventy tons had been taken up for that purpo&s;e. This ve&s;&s;el was called the Endeavour, and the command of her given to Lieutenant James Cook, a gentleman of undoubted abilities in a&s;tronomy and navigation, who was &s;oon after, by the Royal Society, appointed, with Mr. Charles Green, a gentleman who had long been a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Dr. Bradley at the Royal Ob&s;ervatory at Greenwich, to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it.</P>
<P>While this ve&s;&s;el was getting ready for her expedition, Captain Wallis returned; and it having been recommended to him by Lord Morton, when he went out, to fix on a proper place for this a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervation, he, by letter, dated on board the Dolphin, the 18th of May 1768, the day before he landed at Ha&s;tings, mentioned Port Royal harbour, in an i&s;land which he had di&s;covered, then called George's I&s;land, and &s;ince Otaheite: the Royal Society therefore, by letter, dated the beginning of June, in an&s;wer to an applica|tion from the Admiralty to be informed whither they would have their ob&s;ervers &s;ent, made choice of that place.</P>
<P>The Endeavour had been built for the coal trade, and a ve&s;&s;el of that con&s;truction was preferred for many rea&s;ons, particularly becau&s;e &s;he was what the &s;ailors call a good &s;ea
<PB N="iv" REF="16">
boat, was more roomy, would take and lie on the ground better, and might be navigated by fewer men than other ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame burden.</P>
<P>Her complement of officers and men was Lieutenant Cook the Commander, with two Lieutenants under him, a Ma&s;ter and boat&s;wain, with each two mates, a &s;urgeon and carpenter, with each one mate, a gunner, a cook, a clerk and &s;teward, two quarter-ma&s;ters, an armourer, a &s;ail-maker, three mid&s;hipmen, forty-one able &s;eamen, twelve marines, and nine &s;ervants, in all eighty-four per&s;ons, be&s;ides the Commander: &s;he was victualled for eighteen months, and took on board ten carriage and twelve &s;wivel guns, with good &s;tore of ammunition and other nece&s;&s;aries. The Endeavour al&s;o, after the a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervation &s;hould be made, was ordered to pro&s;ecute the de&s;ign of making di&s;|coveries in the South Seas. What was effected by the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els in their &s;everal voyages, will appear in the cour&s;e of this work, of which it is now nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account.</P>
<P>It is drawn up from the journals that were kept by the Commanders of the &s;everal &s;hips, which were put into my hands by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty for that purpo&s;e: and, with re&s;pect to the voyage of the Endeavour, from other papers equally authentic; an a&s;&s;i&s;tance which I have acknowledged in an introduction to the account of her voyage.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t undertook the work, it was debated, whether it &s;hould be written in the fir&s;t or third per&s;on: it was rea|dily acknowledged on all hands, that a narrative in the fir&s;t per&s;on would, by bringing the Adventurer and the Reader nearer together, without the intervention of a &s;tranger, more &s;trongly excite an intere&s;t, and con&s;equently afford more entertainment; but it was objected, that if it was
<PB N="v" REF="17">
written in the name of the &s;everal Commanders, I could ex|hibit only a naked narrative, without any opinion or &s;enti|ment of my own, however fair the occa&s;ion, and without noting the &s;imilitude or di&s;&s;imilitude between the opinions, cu&s;toms, or manners of the people now fir&s;t di&s;covered, and tho&s;e of nations that have been long known, or remarking on any other incident or particular that might occur. In an&s;wer to this objection, however, it was &s;aid, that as the manu&s;cript would be &s;ubmitted to the Gentlemen in who&s;e names it would be written, &s;uppo&s;ing the narrative to be in the fir&s;t per&s;on, and nothing publi&s;hed without their appro|bation, it would &s;ignify little who conceived the &s;entiments that &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed, and therefore I might &s;till be at liberty to expre&s;s my own. In this opinion all parties ac|quie&s;ced, and it was determined that the narrative &s;hould be written in the fir&s;t per&s;on, and that I might notwith&s;tand|ing inter&s;per&s;e &s;uch &s;entiments and ob&s;ervations as my &s;ub|ject &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t: they are not indeed numerous, and when they occur, are always cur&s;ory and &s;hort; for nothing would have been more ab&s;urd than to interrupt an intere&s;t|ing narrative, or new de&s;criptions, by hypothe&s;is and di&s;&s;er|tation. They will however be found mo&s;t frequent in the account of the voyage of the Endeavour, and the principal rea&s;on is, that although it &s;tands la&s;t in the &s;eries, great part of it was printed before the others were written, &s;o that &s;e|veral remarks, which would naturally have been &s;ugge&s;ted by the incidents and de&s;criptions that would have occurred in the preceding voyages, were anticipated by &s;imilar inci|dents and de&s;criptions which occurred in this.</P>
<P>Some particulars that are related in one voyage will per|haps appear to be repeated in another, as they would nece&s;|&s;arily have been if the &s;everal Commanders had written the account of their voyages them&s;elves; for a dige&s;t could not
<PB N="vi" REF="18">
have been made of the whole, without invading the right of each navigator to appropriate the relation of what he had &s;een: the&s;e repetitions however taken together will be found to fill but a few pages of the book.</P>
<P>That no doubt might remain of the fidelity with which I have related the events recorded in my materials, the manu|&s;cript account of each voyage was read to the re&s;pective Commanders at the Admiralty, by the appointment of Lord Sandwich, who was him&s;elf pre&s;ent during much the great|e&s;t part of the time. The account of the voyage of the En|deavour was al&s;o read to Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in who&s;e hands, as well as in tho&s;e of Captain Cook, the manu|&s;cript was left for a con&s;iderable time after the reading. Commodore Byron al&s;o, Captain Wallis and Captain Carteret, had the manu&s;cripts of their re&s;pective voyages to peru&s;e, after they had been read at the Admiralty in their pre&s;ence, and &s;uch emendations as they &s;ugge&s;ted were made. In order thus to authenticate the voyage of Captain Cook, the account of it was fir&s;t written, becau&s;e it was expected when his journal was put into my hands, that he would have &s;ailed on the voyage he is now making in le&s;s than five months.</P>
<P>It will probably be thought by many Readers, that I have related the nautical events too minutely; but it mu&s;t be re|membered, that minutely to relate the&s;e events was the great object of the work. It was in particular thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert the &s;ituation of the &s;hip at different hours of the day, with the bearings of different parts of the land while &s;he was navigating &s;eas, and examining &s;hores that hitherto have been altogether unknown, in order to a&s;cer|tain her track more minutely than could be done in any chart, however large the &s;cale, and to de&s;cribe with critical
<PB N="vii" REF="19">
exactne&s;s the bays, headlands, and other irregularities of the coa&s;t; the appearance of the country, its hills, vallies, mountains, and woods, with the depth of water, and every other particular that might enable future navigators ea&s;ily to find, and &s;afely to vi&s;it every part of it. I was not indeed my&s;elf &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed of the minutene&s;s that was ne|ce&s;&s;ary in this part of the work, &s;o that I was obliged to make many additions to it, after I had prepared my manu&s;cript. It is however hoped, that tho&s;e who read merely for enter|tainment will be compen&s;ated by the de&s;cription of coun|tries which no European had before vi&s;ited, and manners which in many in&s;tances exhibit a new picture of human life. In this part, the relation of little circum&s;tances re|quires no apology, for it is from little circum&s;tances that the relation of great events derives its power over the mind. An account that ten thou&s;and men peri&s;hed in a battle, that twice the number were &s;wallowed up by an earthquake, or that a whole nation was &s;wept away by a pe&s;tilence, is read in the naked brevity of an index, without the lea&s;t emotion, by tho&s;e who feel them&s;elves &s;trongly intere&s;ted even for Pamela, the imaginary heroine of a novel that is remarkable for the enumeration of particulars in them&s;elves &s;o trifling, that we almo&s;t wonder how they could occur to the author's mind.</P>
<P>This work is illu&s;trated and adorned by a great number of cuts, from which every cla&s;s of readers, whether their object is knowlege or plea&s;ure, will find equal advantage, as they con&s;i&s;t not only of maps and charts, drawn with great &s;kill and attention, but of views and figures, de&s;igned and executed by the be&s;t arti&s;ts in this country.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual way to prevent ob&s;curity and confu&s;ion in relating events, is to range them in order of time, which
<PB N="viii" REF="20">
however cannot be done in an unbroken &s;eries when the complicated and multifarious objects of hi&s;tory are to be re|corded; but as each of the narratives in this work is a &s;ingle thread, the tran&s;actions of every day are &s;et down in a regu|lar &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the time noted in the margin.</P>
<P>Great care has been taken to make the charts and the nautical part of the narrative coincide; if there &s;hould be any difference, which it is hoped will not be the ca&s;e, the charts are to be confided in, as of unque&s;tionable authority. By the charts, as well as by the narrative, e&s;pecially by that on which the tracks of the &s;everal ve&s;&s;els are marked, it will be &s;een how far the exi&s;tence or non exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern con|tinent is already a&s;certained, and what land has in the cour&s;e of the&s;e voyages been fir&s;t di&s;covered. The charts al&s;o will at one view prevent any mi&s;take which might ari&s;e from the &s;ame name having been given to different i&s;lands by the &s;everal Commanders in the&s;e voyages, without the trouble of comparing the latitudes and longitudes a&s;&s;igned them in the narrative.</P>
<P>As it is but a very few years &s;ince the exi&s;tence of a race of men above the common &s;tature upon the coa&s;t of Patago|nia, was the &s;ubject of eager di&s;pute among all ranks of people in this country, I have brought together the whole of the evidence on the que&s;tion, as I find it in a collection of voyages lately printed in France, under the title of "Hi&s;toire des Navigationes aux Terres Au&s;trales."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the contrariety of the re|ports that have been made, by ocular witne&s;&s;es, concerning a fact ea&s;y to be determined, does not deviate le&s;s from the common cour&s;e of things than the gigantic &s;tature of the people in que&s;tion. It appears, that during an hundred
<PB N="ix" REF="21">
years, almo&s;t all navigators, of whatever country, agree in affirming the exi&s;tence of a race of giants upon the coa&s;t of Patagonia; and that during another century, the much greater number agree in denying the fact, treating their predece&s;&s;ors as idle fabuli&s;ts, and imputing their reports either to the terror which the rude fiercene&s;s of a &s;avage people in&s;pired, or to the natural propen&s;ity of mankind to a&s;&s;ume importance, by pretending to have &s;een wonderful things. That men have a &s;trange propen&s;ity to the marvelous cannot be denied, nor that fear naturally magnifies its object; but though it be allowed that the accounts of the Patagonians have in &s;ome in&s;tances been exaggerated, it is certain, that all who have affirmed their &s;tature to be gigantic, were not under the influence of fear; and it is very &s;trange, that na|tions who have an hereditary hatred to each other, and an acknowledged oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, &s;hould agree in a&s;&s;ert|ing an evident fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place, it is well known to have been an opinion long e&s;tabli&s;hed, both in our ancient world and in America, that there was once a race of giants upon earth who di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves by violence and guilt.</P>
<P>"Barbenais was told by the inhabitants of South America, that a deluge having laid Peru under water, the Indians re|tired to the mountains till the flood &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide, and that when they came again down to the plain, they found there men of an enormous &s;tature, who attacked them with great ferocity, killing many, and driving the re&s;t to the caves of the rocks; but that having continued in their hiding places many years, they &s;aw in the air a young man who de&s;troyed the giants by thunderbolts, and thus re&s;tored to them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country. His guides al&s;o &s;howed
<PB N="x" REF="22">
him many marks upon a rock which they &s;aid were im|pre&s;&s;ed by the thunderbolts, and many bones of an extraor|dinary &s;ize, which they believed to be remains of the giants; but they did not pretend to know when the deluge hap|pened.</P>
<P>"The Ynca Garcila&s;&s;o de la Vega, in his hi&s;tory of Peru, re|lates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pedro de Cieca, chap. 52. Garci|la&s;&s;o, Hi&s;t. du Perou. liv. 9. chap. 9.</NOTE> that according to a tradition univer&s;ally received, a num|ber of ve&s;&s;els or junks came to Point Saint Helena with a com|pany of giants on board, of a &s;tature &s;o enormous that the natives of the country were not higher than their knees: that their eyes were as broad as the bottom of a plate, and their limbs proportionably large: that &s;ome of them were naked, and others &s;lightly covered with the &s;kins of bea&s;ts. That when they came on &s;hore, they dug a pit of an a&s;toni&s;hing depth in the rock, and each of them con&s;uming as much provi|&s;ions as would be &s;ufficient for fifty men, the country was &s;oon exhau&s;ted, and they were obliged to live upon fi&s;h: that they &s;eized the women of the country, to whom their bru|tality was fatal, and afterwards giving them&s;elves up to wor&s;e vices, the whole race was de&s;troyed by fire from heaven, which however left their bones uncon&s;umed, as a la&s;ting memorial of Divine vengeance. Bones of an amazing &s;ize are &s;aid to have been found in this country, and frag|ments of teeth, which, if they were whole, mu&s;t have weighed half a pound.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to know all the particulars of the&s;e American traditions may &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity by reading Tor|quemado, lib. 1. chap. 13 and 14. where they will find that the&s;e fables are very &s;imilar to tho&s;e relative to the &s;ame &s;ubject in other parts of the world. The bones, &s;aid to have been the bones of giants, which have been found in Ame|rica,
<PB N="xi" REF="23">
and which were &s;hewn at Mexico and other places in the year 1550, are probably the bones of &s;ome animal un|known; and indeed nothing le&s;s than the &s;ight of &s;uch a race of human beings, or of an entire &s;keleton, can be ad|mitted as a proof of their exi&s;tence. Turner, the naturali&s;t, reports, that in the year 1610, the thigh bone of a man was &s;hewn in London, who mu&s;t have been of an enormous &s;ize; but this te&s;timony is not deci&s;ive, though the author adds, that he had him&s;elf &s;een near the river Plata, upon the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, a race of giants who went &s;tark naked; that the hinder part of their heads was flat, and not round; that the women had long black hair, as coar&s;e as a hor&s;e's mane; that the men were excellent archers, and, be&s;ides their bow and arrows, carried two ma&s;&s;ive balls or bullets, each fa&s;tened to one end of a thong, a weapon which they u&s;ed with great dexterity and force, either by &s;triking with it, or throwing it like a &s;tone from a &s;ling. One of the&s;e giants, he &s;ays, was twelve feet high; but acknowledges that he &s;aw no other &s;o tall.</P>
<P>"Of this fact there are other ocular witne&s;&s;es who perhaps may be thought more worthy of credit; among the Spa|niards, Magellan, Loai&s;a, Sarmiento, and Nodal; among the Engli&s;h, Cavendi&s;h, Hawkins, and Knivet; among the Dutch, Sebald, de Noort, le Maire, and Spilberg; and among the French, tho&s;e who went in the expedition from Mar&s;eilles, and Saint Maloes. Tho&s;e who bear te&s;timony to the con|trary, are Winter, the Dutch Admiral Hermite, Froger in de Gennes's narrative, and Sir John Narborough. Winter, after having him&s;elf &s;een the inhabitants of Patagonia, &s;ays in direct terms, that the accounts of their being giants are fal&s;ehoods invented by the Spaniards; and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed that the te&s;timony of the&s;e navigators at lea&s;t counter|balances
<PB N="xii" REF="24">
the evidence on the other &s;ide, e&s;pecially as they were be&s;t acquainted with the Streight of Magellan, and the neighbouring country. Such navigators as have vi&s;ited this country, and are &s;ilent with re&s;pect to the &s;tature of the in|habitants, particularly Sir Francis Drake, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as witne&s;&s;es again&s;t the fact in que&s;tion; for their &s;ilence is a proof that they &s;aw nothing extraordinary. It mu&s;t how|ever be ob&s;erved, in the fir&s;t place, that the greater part of tho&s;e who hold the affirmative in this que&s;tion, &s;peak of people that inhabited the de&s;ert coa&s;t of Patagonia to the ea&s;t and we&s;t; and that, on the contrary, tho&s;e who hold the negative, &s;peak of tho&s;e who inhabit the Streight upon the &s;ides of the utmo&s;t point of America to the north and &s;outh. The nations of the&s;e two di&s;tricts are certainly not the &s;ame; and if the fir&s;t have &s;ometimes been &s;een in the Streight, it cannot be thought &s;trange, con&s;idering how &s;hort the di&s;tance is from Port Saint Julian, which appears to be their ordinary habitation. Magellan, and his people &s;aw them there very often, and trafficked with them &s;ometimes on board his &s;hips, and &s;ometimes on &s;hore: nor was this all, he &s;eized two of them, and kept them pri|&s;oners in his ve&s;&s;el, one of whom was baptized &s;ome time before his death, and taught &s;everal words of his language to Pigafette, who formed them into a little dictionary: the&s;e are facts than which nothing can be more po&s;itive, or le&s;s &s;ubject to illu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I affirm, &s;ays Knivet, that when I was at Port De&s;ire I mea&s;ured &s;everal dead bodies that I found buried there, which were from fourteen to &s;ixteen &s;pans high, and &s;aw tracks in the &s;and which mu&s;t have been left by people of nearly the &s;ame &s;tature. I have al&s;o frequently &s;een at Bra|zil, one of the Patagonians who had been taken at Port Saint
<PB N="xiii" REF="25">
Julian, and though he was but a youth, he mea&s;ured no le&s;s than thirteen &s;pans: and our Engli&s;h pri&s;oners at Brazil have a&s;&s;ured me that they had &s;een many men of the &s;ame &s;tature upon the coa&s;ts of the &s;treight." Sebald de Wert &s;ays, that when he was in the Streight, he &s;aw giants of the &s;ame bulk, who tore up trees by the roots, that were a &s;pan in diameter, with great facility; he al&s;o &s;aw women that were gigantic, and others of the common &s;tature. Oliver de Noort reports, that he &s;aw &s;avages of a gigantic &s;tature at Port De&s;ire, but does not call them giants: that he took &s;ix of them pri&s;oners, and carried them on board his &s;hip, one of whom afterwards told him that the country was inhabited by many different nations, four of which were of the ordi|nary &s;tature; but that farther within the land, in a territory called <HI>Coin,</HI> there was a gigantic people, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Tiremenen, who were continually making war upon the other nations. Spilberg relates, that he &s;aw a man of an extraordinary &s;tature upon the coa&s;t of Terra del Fuego, but that the &s;epulchres which he found, had re|ceived men of the common height. Aris-Cla&s;z, who was on board La Maire's fleet in the character of Commi&s;&s;ary, a man well worthy of credit, declares, that having vi&s;ited the &s;epulchres which he di&s;covered upon the coa&s;t of Patagonia, he found the bones of men who were between ten and eleven feet high, which convinced him that the reports of former navigators were true; and here it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the examination was made in cold blood, when it cannot be pre|tended that the object was magnified by fear. Some others, particularly Nodal and Sir Richard Hawkins, content them|&s;elves with &s;aying that the&s;e &s;avages were a head taller than the inhabitants of Europe, and of &s;uch a &s;tature that the people on board their ve&s;&s;els called them giants. Such is the evidence of pa&s;t times; we &s;hall now con&s;ider that of the age
<PB N="xiv" REF="26">
in which we live. In 1704, the Captains Harrington and Carman, who commanded two French ve&s;&s;els, one from Saint Maloes, and the other from Mar&s;eilles, &s;aw at one time &s;even of the&s;e giants in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion Bay, at another time &s;ix, and at a third time they had an interview with a com|pany of more than four hundred men, part of whom were gigantic, and part of the common &s;tature. That Harring|ton and Carman reported this fact, is atte&s;ted by M. Frezier, &s;uperintendant of the fortifications of Bretagne, a man well known, and univer&s;ally e&s;teemed. Frezier never &s;aw any of the&s;e &s;avages him&s;elf, but he &s;ays, that being upon the coa&s;t of Chili, Don Pedro Molina, Governor of the i&s;le of Chilo&euml;, and many other eye-witne&s;&s;es, told him, that there was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance within the country, an Indian nation, called by their neighbours <HI>Caucohues,</HI> who &s;ome|times came down to the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, that were more than nine feet high, and were the &s;ame race with the Pata|gonians who live on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, and have been men|tioned in former relations. We are told by Reaveneau de Lu&s;&s;an, that the Spaniards who live upon the &s;ea coa&s;t in South America, report that certain white Indians inhabit part of Chili, with whom they are always at war: that they are of an enor|mous bulk and &s;tature, and that whenever they take a Spa|niard pri&s;oner, they force up the brea&s;t-bone, as they would the &s;hell of a tortoi&s;e, and tear out his heart. Narborough, on the contrary, though he agrees that the Indians who in|habit the mountains near the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements at Chili, and perpetually commit ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, are tall, expre&s;sly denies that their &s;tature is gigantic. He had often mea&s;ured the &s;kulls and the prints of the feet of the &s;avages on the coa&s;ts of the Streight of Magellan, which, he &s;ays, were of the common &s;ize: he had al&s;o &s;everal times &s;een nu|merous companies of them even at Port Saint Julian, and
<PB N="xv" REF="27">
the&s;e he declares not to be taller or bigger than other men. Narborough is certainly a credible witne&s;s, and his evidence is directly to the point: it is confirmed by that of L'Hermite, who &s;ays, that the people he &s;aw upon the coa&s;t of Terra del Fuego, though they were robu&s;t and well-proportioned, were not larger than the inhabitants of Europe; and la&s;tly. M. de Gennes bears te&s;timony that none of the people he &s;aw at Port Famine were &s;ix feet high.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e who diligently con&s;ider the&s;e different relations will find rea&s;on to believe, that all the parties have &s;poken truth, each of them faithfully reporting what he &s;aw, and there|fore that the exi&s;tence of a gigantic race in the&s;e parts is a real fact, not to be que&s;tioned merely becau&s;e they were not &s;een by every mariner that vi&s;ited the country.</P>
<P>"It appears to be well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the inhabitants of the two borders of the Streight are of the common &s;tature; and that the race di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Patagonians, made their con&s;tant re&s;idence upon the de&s;art coa&s;ts, either in &s;ome mi&s;erable hovels in the depth of the woods, or in &s;ome caverns of the rocks, &s;carcely acce&s;&s;ible to any but them&s;elves: and it appears from the account of Oliver de Noort, that when the Streight began to be frequented by European ve&s;&s;els, they hid them&s;elves as &s;oon as the &s;hips were in &s;ight, which accounts both for their not being &s;een, and for the recent marks of inhabitants upon a coa&s;t that appeared to be de&s;art. Perhaps the frequent appearance of our &s;hips upon this coa&s;t, at length determined them to quit it as a &s;ettled habitation, returning only at particular &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and taking up their con&s;tant re&s;idence in the in|terior part of the country. Lord An&s;on was of opinion, that they re&s;ided &s;tatedly on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Cordeliers,
<PB N="xvi" REF="28">
and vi&s;ited the ea&s;tern &s;ide occa&s;ionally, but not often: &s;o that if they have been rarely &s;een by the ve&s;&s;els which have touched at the coa&s;t of Patagonia for the la&s;t hundred years, the rea&s;on probably is, that being, like other Indian nations, de&s;irous to conceal them&s;elves from &s;trangers, they re|tired to the mountains. It is indeed to be regretted, that no &s;keleton of the&s;e people has been brought into Europe; and it may at fir&s;t &s;eem &s;trange, that no &s;uch evidence of their uncommon &s;tature &s;hould have been produced, as it is known that &s;everal of them who had been made pri&s;oners by the Commanders of European ve&s;&s;els, died on board &s;oon after they came into a hot climate; but the wonder will cea&s;e, when it is con&s;idered that all mariners have a &s;uper|&s;titious opinion that the compa&s;s will not traver&s;e if there is a dead body on board the ve&s;&s;el." Upon the whole, it may rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed, that the concurrent te&s;timony of late navigators, particularly Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, and Captain Carteret, Gentlemen of unque&s;tionable veracity, who are &s;till living, and who not only &s;aw and conver&s;ed with the&s;e people but mea&s;ured them, will put an end to all the doubts that have been hitherto entertained of their exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>Having thus brought together the whole of the evidence for and again&s;t a fact which has long been the object both of popular and philo&s;ophical curio&s;ity, I &s;hall not anticipate any opinion that the Reader may form concerning future navigations in the track which has been de&s;cribed by any of the ve&s;&s;els who&s;e voyages are here related, except that al|though it is the opinion of Commodore Byron, who &s;pent &s;even weeks and two days in pa&s;&s;ing through the Streight of Magellan, that it may be pa&s;&s;ed in three weeks at the pro|per &s;ea&s;on; yet the pa&s;&s;age co&s;t Captain Wallis near four
<PB N="xvii" REF="29">
months, though he performed it preci&s;ely at the time re|commended by the Commodore, having reached the ea&s;tern entrance about the middle of December.</P>
<P>I cannot however di&s;mi&s;s my Readers to the following narratives, without expre&s;&s;ing the regret with which I have recorded the de&s;truction of poor naked &s;avages, by our fire-arms, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e expeditions, when they endea|voured to repre&s;s the invaders of their country; a regret which I am confident my Readers will participate with me: this however appears to be an evil which, if di&s;coveries of new countries are attempted, cannot be avoided: re&s;i&s;tance will always be made, and if tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t are not over|powered, the attempt mu&s;t be relinqui&s;hed. It may perhaps be &s;aid, that the expence of life upon the&s;e occa&s;ions is more than is nece&s;&s;ary to convince the natives that further conte&s;t is hopele&s;s, and perhaps this may &s;ometimes have been true: but it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that if &s;uch expeditions are under|taken, the execution of them mu&s;t be intru&s;ted to per&s;ons not exempt from human frailty; to men who are liable to provocation by &s;udden injury, to unpremeditated violence by &s;udden danger, to error by the defect of judgment or the &s;trength of pa&s;&s;ion, and always di&s;po&s;ed to transfer laws by which they are bound them&s;elves; to others who are not &s;ub|ject to their obligation; &s;o that every exce&s;s thus produced is al&s;o an inevitable evil.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e mi&s;chiefs to be inevitable in attempting di&s;coveries, di&s;coveries ought not to be attempted; it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that upon the only principles on which this opinion can be &s;upported, the ri&s;k of life, for advantages of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e propo&s;ed in di&s;covering new countries, is in every other in&s;tance un|lawful. If it is not lawful to put the life of an Indian in
<PB N="xviii" REF="30">
hazard, by an attempt to examine the country in which he lives, with a view to increa&s;e commerce or knowlege; it is not lawful to ri&s;k the life of our own people in carrying on commerce with countries already known. If it being &s;aid that the ri&s;k of life in our own people is voluntary, and that the Indian is brought into danger without his con&s;ent, the con|&s;equence will &s;till follow; for it is univer&s;ally agreed, at lea&s;t upon the principles of Chri&s;tianity, that men have no more right over their own lives than over the lives of others, and &s;uicide being deemed the wor&s;t &s;pecies of murder, a man mu&s;t be proportionably criminal in expo&s;ing his own life, for any purpo&s;e that would not ju&s;tify his expo&s;ing the life of another. If the gratification of artificial wants, or the inrea&s;e of knowlege, are ju&s;tifiable cau&s;es for the ri&s;k of life, the landing by force on a newly di&s;covered country, in or|der to examine its produce, may be ju&s;tified; if not, every trade and profe&s;&s;ion that expo&s;es life for advantages of the &s;ame kind is unlawful; and by what trade or profe&s;&s;ion is not life expo&s;ed? Let us examine all the multitudes that art has employed, from the refiner who &s;weats at the furnace to the &s;edentary artificer who grows pale at the loom, and per|haps none can be found in which life is not in &s;ome degree &s;acrificed to the artificial nece&s;&s;ities of civil &s;ociety. But will it therefore be &s;aid, that civil &s;ociety, to which this &s;acrifice is made, is for that rea&s;on a combination contrary to the great original principles of morality, which are the ba&s;is of all duty? Will it be &s;aid, that to exerci&s;e the faculties which are the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of our nature is unna|tural? and that being endowed with the various powers which in civil &s;ocieties only can be brought into action, it was incongruous to the will of our Creator that any &s;uch &s;ociety &s;hould be formed, and that it would be plea&s;ing to him if, &s;till continuing in a &s;avage &s;tate, the&s;e powers &s;hould
<PB N="xix" REF="31">
lie torpid in our nature, like life in an embrio, during the whole of our exi&s;tence? This &s;urely mu&s;t appear extrava|gant and ab&s;urd in the highe&s;t degree, e&s;pecially as it mu&s;t be allowed, that although commerce and arts in &s;ome in|&s;tances expo&s;e life, in others they pre&s;erve it; they &s;upply the wants of Nature, without rapine and violence, and by producing a common intere&s;t, they prevent the inhabitants of the &s;ame country from being divided into different clans, which among &s;avages are almo&s;t perpetually committing ho&s;|tilities again&s;t each other, with a ferocious cruelty which is not to be found where civil government and literary knowlege have meliorated the manners of mankind. Upon the whole, therefore, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude, that the increa&s;e of knowlege and commerce are ultimately common bene|fits; and that the lo&s;s of life which happens in the attempt, is among the partial evils which terminate in general good.</P>
<P>I have now only to reque&s;t of &s;uch of my Readers as may be di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure me for not having attributed any of the critical e&s;capes from danger that I have recorded, to the particular interpo&s;ition of Providence, that they would, in this particular, allow me the right of private judgment, which I claim with the greater confidence, as the very &s;ame principle which would have determined them to have done it, has determined me to the contrary. As I firmly believe the divine precept delivered by the Author of Chri&s;tianity, "there is not a &s;parrow falls to the ground without my Fa|ther," and cannot admit the agency of chance in the govern|ment of the world, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily refer every event to one cau&s;e, as well the danger as the e&s;cape, as well the &s;ufferings as the enjoyments of life: and for this opinion, I have, among other re&s;pectable authorities, that of the Bible. Shall we, &s;ays Job, "receive good from the hand of God and &s;hall we not re|ceive evil?" The Supreme Being is equally wi&s;e and benevolent

in the di&s;pen&s;ation of both evil and good, as means of effect|ing ultimate purpo&s;es worthy of his ineffable perfections; &s;o that whether we con&s;ider our&s;elves as chri&s;tians or philo&s;o|phers, we mu&s;t acknowledge that he de&s;erves ble&s;&s;ing not more when he gives than when he takes away. If the fall of a &s;parrow, as well as its pre&s;ervation, is imputed to pro|vidence, why not the fall as well as the pre&s;ervation of a man? and why &s;hould we attribute to Providence only what appears to be good in its immediate effect, when we &s;uppo&s;e that the whole concatenation of events, whether the pre|&s;ervation or de&s;truction of particular parts, tends ultimately to the good of the whole? The &s;ame voice commi&s;&s;ions the winds to plough up the deep, which at the appointed time re|bukes them, &s;aying, "Peace, be &s;till." If the adorable Author and Pre&s;erver of Nature was &s;uch a being as Baal is repre|&s;ented to have been by the prophet, when he derided his wor|&s;hippers; if he was &s;ometimes on a journey, and &s;ometimes a&s;leep, we might with propriety &s;ay that a fire <HI>happened</HI> to break out, or a &s;torm to ri&s;e, but that by the interpo&s;ition of providence life was pre&s;erved, expre&s;&s;ions which imply that the mi&s;chief had one origin, and the remedy another; but &s;uch language certainly derogates from the honour of the great Univer&s;al Cau&s;e, who, acting through all duration, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in all &s;pace, fills immen&s;ity with his pre&s;ence, and eternity with his power.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be &s;aid, that in particular in&s;tances evil nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from that con&s;titution of things which is be&s;t upon the whole, and that Providence occa&s;ionally inter|feres, and &s;upplies the defects of the con&s;titution in the&s;e particulars: but this notion will appear not to be &s;upported by tho&s;e facts which are &s;aid to be providential; it will al|ways be found that Providence interpo&s;es too late, and only moderates the mi&s;chief which it might have prevented. But
<PB N="xxi" REF="33">
who can &s;uppo&s;e an extraordinary interpo&s;ition of Providence to &s;upply particular defects in the con&s;titution of nature, who &s;ees tho&s;e defects &s;upplied but in part? It is true that when the Endeavour was upon the rock off the coa&s;t of New Holland, the wind cea&s;ed, and that otherwi&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have been beaten to pieces; but either the &s;ub&s;iding of the wind was a mere natural event or not; if it was a natural event, providence is out of the que&s;tion, at lea&s;t we can with no more propriety &s;ay that providentially the wind cea&s;ed, than that providentially the &s;un ro&s;e in the morning. If it was not a mere natural event, but produced by an extraordinary interpo&s;ition, correcting a defect in the con&s;titution of nature, tending to mi&s;chief, it will lie upon tho&s;e who maintain the po&s;ition, to &s;hew, why an extraordinary interpo&s;ition did not take place rather to prevent the &s;hip's &s;triking, than to pre|vent her being beaten to pieces after &s;he had &s;truck: a very &s;light impul&s;e upon the &s;hip's cour&s;e would have cau&s;ed her to &s;teer clear of the rock, and if all things were not equally ea&s;y to Omnipotence, we &s;hould &s;ay that this might have been done with le&s;s difficulty than a calm could be produced by &s;u&s;pending the general laws of Nature which had brought on the gale.</P>
<P>I have, however, paid my homage to the Supreme Being, con&s;onant to my own ideas of his agency and perfections; and tho&s;e who are of opinion that my notions are erroneous, mu&s;t allow, that he who does what he thinks to be right, and ab&s;tains from what he thinks to be wrong, acquits him|&s;elf equally of moral obligation, whether his opinions are fal&s;e or true.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">[The longitude in this voyage is reckoned from the meridian of London, we&s;t to 180 degrees, and ea&s;t afterwards.]</HEAD>
<P>ON the 21&s;t of June 1764, I &s;ailed from the Downs,<MILESTONE N="1764" UNIT="year"> <MILESTONE N="June" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 21" UNIT="day"> with his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Dolphin, and the Tamar frigate, which I had received orders to take under my command: as I was coming down the river, the Dolphin got a-ground; I therefore put into Plymouth, where &s;he was docked, but did not appear to have received any damage. At this place we changed &s;ome of our men, and having paid the people two months wages in advance, I hoi&s;ted the broad pendant, and &s;ailed again on the 3d of July; <MILESTONE N="July" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> on the 4th we were off the Lizard,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 4" UNIT="day"> and made the be&s;t of our way with a fine breeze, but had the mortification to find the Tamar a very heavy &s;ailer. In the night of Friday the 6th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 6" UNIT="day"> the officer of the fir&s;t watch &s;aw either a &s;hip on fire, or an extraordinary pheno|menon which greatly re&s;embled it, at &s;ome di&s;tance: it con|tinued to blaze for about half an hour, and then di&s;appeared. In the evening of Thur&s;day, July the 12th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 12" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw the rocks near the i&s;land of Madeira, which our people call the De|&s;erters; from <HI>de&s;ertes,</HI> a name which has been given them from their barren and de&s;olate appearance:<MILESTONE N="Friday 13" UNIT="day"> the next day we &s;tood in for the road of Funchiale, where, about three o'clock in the afternoon, we came to an anchor. In the morning of Saturday the 14th, I waited upon the Governor,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 14" UNIT="day"> who re|ceived me with great politene&s;s, and &s;aluted me with eleven
<PB N="4" REF="60">
guns,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 15" UNIT="day"> which I returned from the &s;hip. The next day, he returned my vi&s;it at the hou&s;e of the Con&s;ul, upon which I &s;aluted him with eleven guns, which he returned from the fort. I found here his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Crown, and the Ferret &s;loop, who al&s;o &s;aluted the broad pendant.</P>
<P>Having completed our water, and procured all the refre&s;h|ment I was able for the companies of both the &s;hips, every man having twenty pounds weight of onions for his &s;ea &s;tock,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> we weighed anchor on Thur&s;day the 19th, and pro|ceeded on our voyage.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 21" UNIT="day"> On Saturday the 21&s;t, we made the i&s;land of Palma, one of the Canaries, and &s;oon after ex|amining our water, we found it would be nece&s;&s;ary to touch at one of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands for a fre&s;h &s;upply. During the whole of our cour&s;e from the Lizard, we ob&s;erved that no fi&s;h followed the &s;hip, which I judged to be owing to her being &s;heathed with copper.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 26" UNIT="day"> By the 26th, our water was become foul, and &s;tunk intolerably, but we purified it with a machine, which had been put on board for that purpo&s;e: it was a kind of ventilator, by which air was forced through the water in a continued &s;tream, as long as it was nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 27th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 27" UNIT="day"> we made the i&s;land of Sal, one of the Cape de Verds, and &s;eeing &s;everal turtle upon the water, we hoi&s;ted out our jolly boat, and attempted to &s;trike them, but they all went down before our people could come within reach of them.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 28" UNIT="day"> On the morning of the 28th, we were very near the i&s;land of Bona Vi&s;ta,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 29" UNIT="day"> the next day off the I&s;le of May,<MILESTONE N="Monday 30" UNIT="day"> and on Monday the 30th, we came to an anchor in Port Praya bay. The rainy &s;ea&s;on was already &s;et in, which renders this place very un&s;afe; a large &s;well that rolls in from the &s;outhward, makes a frightful &s;urf upon the &s;hore, and there is rea&s;on every hour to expect a tornado,
<PB N="5" REF="61">
of which, as it is very violent, and blows directly in,<MILESTONE N="Monday 30" UNIT="day"> the con&s;equences are likely to be fatal; &s;o that after the 15th of Augu&s;t no &s;hip comes hither till the rainy &s;ea&s;on is over, which happens in November; for this rea&s;on I made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to fill my water and get away. I procured three bullocks for the people, but they were little better than carrion, and the weather was &s;o hot, that the fle&s;h &s;tunk in a few hours after they were killed.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 2d of Augu&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Augu&s;t" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 2" UNIT="day"> we got again under &s;ail, with a large cargo of fowls, lean goats, and monkies, which the people contrived to procure for old &s;hirts, jackets, and other articles of the like kind. The intolerable heat, and almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant rain, very &s;oon affected our health, and the men began to fall down in fevers, notwith&s;tanding all my attention and diligence to make them &s;hift them&s;elves before they &s;lept, when they were wet.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 8th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 8" UNIT="day"> the Tamar fired a gun, upon which we &s;hortened &s;ail till &s;he came up: we found that &s;he had &s;uffered no damage but the carrying away of her top-&s;ail-yard; however, as we were obliged to make an ea&s;y &s;ail till &s;he had got up another, and the wind &s;eemed to be coming again to the &s;outhward, we lo&s;t a good deal of way. We continued, to our great mortification, to ob&s;erve that no fi&s;h would come near enough to our copper bottom for us to &s;trike, though we &s;aw the &s;ea as it were quickened with them at a little di&s;tance.

the great Road of Rio de Janeiro.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> The city, which is large, and makes a hand&s;ome appearance, is governed by the Viceroy of Brazil, who is perhaps, in fact, as ab&s;olute a &s;overeign as any upon earth. When I vi&s;ited him, he re|ceived me in great form; above &s;ixty officers were drawn up before the palace, as well as a captain's guard, who were men of a good appearance, and extremely well clothed: his Excellency, with a number of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, belonging to the place, met me at the head of the &s;tairs, upon which fifteen guns were fired from the neare&s;t port: we then entered the room of &s;tate, and after conver&s;ing about a quarter of an hour, in French, I took my leave, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame form that had been u&s;ed at my re|ception. He offered to return my vi&s;it at a hou&s;e which I had hired on &s;hore, but this I declined, and &s;oon after he re|turned it on board.</P>
<P>The people in my own &s;hip, who had as much fre&s;h meat and greens as they could eat every day, were very healthy, but there being many &s;ick on board the Tamar, I procured a place for them on &s;hore, where they &s;oon recovered. I al&s;o engaged a number of Portugue&s;e caulkers, as the &s;eams of both the &s;hips were very open, who, after having worked &s;ome time, rendered them perfectly tight.</P>
<P>While we lay here, Lord Clive, in the Kent Indiaman, came to the port. This &s;hip had &s;ailed from England a month before us, and had not touched any where, yet &s;he came in a month after us; &s;o that her pa&s;&s;age was ju&s;t two months longer than ours, notwith&s;tanding the time we lo&s;t in waiting for the Tamar, which, though the Dolphin was by no means a good &s;ailer, &s;ailed &s;o much wor&s;e, that we &s;eldom &s;pread more than half our canvas.

<P><PB N="7" REF="63">On Tue&s;day the 16th of October, we weighed anchor,<MILESTONE N="October" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> being impatient to get to &s;ea, for the heat here was intolerable; but we lay four or five days above the bar, waiting for the land breeze to carry us out, for there is no getting out with the &s;ea breeze, and the entrance between the two fir&s;t forts is &s;o narrow, and &s;o great a &s;ea breaks in upon them, that it was not without much danger and difficulty we got out at la&s;t, and if we had followed the advice of the Portugue&s;e pilot, we had certainly lo&s;t the &s;hip. As this narrative is publi&s;hed for the advantage of future navigators, particu|larly tho&s;e of our own nation, it is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould ob|&s;erve, that the Portugue&s;e here, carrying on a great trade, make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to attend every time a boat comes on &s;hore, and practi&s;e every artifice in their power to entice away the crew: if other methods do not &s;ucceed, they make them drunk, and immediately &s;end them up the country, taking effectual care to prevent their return, till the &s;hip to which they belong has left the place; by this practice I lo&s;t five of my men, and the Tamar nine: mine I never reco|vered, but the Tamar had the good fortune to learn where her's were detained, and by &s;ending out a party in the night, &s;urpri&s;ed them, and brought them back.</P>

<P>On Monday the 12th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 12" UNIT="day"> about four o'clock in the afternoon, as I was walking on the quarter-deck, all the people upon the foreca&s;tle called out at once "Land right ahead;" it was then very black almo&s;t round the horizon, and we had had much thunder and lightning; I looked forward under the fore&s;ail, and upon the lee bow, and &s;aw what at fir&s;t appeared to be an i&s;land, ri&s;ing in two rude craggy hills, but upon looking to leeward I &s;aw land joining to it, and running a long way to the &s;outh ea&s;t: we were then &s;teering S.

Though I had been almo&s;t continually at &s;ea for &s;even and twenty years, I had never &s;een &s;uch a deception before; others however have been equally deceived; for the ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, not long &s;ince, made oath, that he had &s;een an i&s;land between the we&s;t end of Ireland and Newfound|land, and even di&s;tingui&s;hed the trees that grew upon it.

<P>The next day, at four o'clock in the afternoon,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> the wea|ther being extremely fine, the wind &s;hifted at once to the S.

I ordered the top&s;ails to be handed immediately; but before it could be done, I &s;aw the &s;ea approaching at &s;ome di&s;tance, in va&s;t billows covered with foam; I called to the people to hawl up the fore&s;ail, and let go the main &s;heet in&s;tantly; for I was per&s;uaded that if we had any &s;ail out when the gu&s;t reached us, we &s;hould either be over&s;et, or lo&s;e all our ma&s;ts. It reached us however before we could rai&s;e the main tack, and laid us upon our beam ends: the main tack was then cut, for it was become impo&s;&s;ible to ca&s;t it off; and the main &s;heet &s;truck down the Fir&s;t Lieutenant, brui&s;ed him dreadfully, and beat out three of his teeth: the main top|&s;ail, which was not quite handed, was &s;plit to pieces. If this &s;quall, which came on with le&s;s warning and more vio|lence than any I had ever &s;een, had taken us in the night, I think the &s;hip mu&s;t have been lo&s;t. When it came on we ob&s;erved &s;everal hundred of birds flying before it, which ex|pre&s;&s;ed their terror by loud &s;hrieks; it la&s;ted about twenty minutes, and then gradually &s;ub&s;ided. The Tamar &s;plit her main &s;ail, but as &s;he was to leeward of us, &s;he had more time to prepare. In a &s;hort time it began to blow very hard
<PB N="12" REF="68">
again,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 14" UNIT="day"> &s;o that we reefed our main &s;ail, and lay to under it all night. As morning approached, the gale became more moderate, but we had &s;till a great &s;ea, and the wind &s;hifting to S. by W. we &s;tood to the we&s;tward under our cour&s;es. Soon after it was light, the &s;ea appeared as red as blood, being covered with a &s;mall &s;hell-fi&s;h of that colour, &s;ome|what re&s;embling our crayfi&s;h, but le&s;s, of which we took up great quantities in ba&s;kets.</P>
<P>At half an hour pa&s;t four in the morning of Thur&s;day the 15th of November,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw land, which had the appearance of an i&s;land about eight or nine leagues long, there being no land in &s;ight either to the northward or &s;outhward, though by the charts it &s;hould be Cape Saint Helena, which projects from the coa&s;t to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and forms two bays, one to the north, and the other to the &s;outh. As the weather was very fine, I tacked and &s;tood in for it about ten o'clock; but as there were many &s;unken rocks at about two leagues di&s;tance from it, upon which the &s;ea broke very high, and the wind &s;eemed to be gradually dying away, I tacked again and &s;tood off. The land appeared to be barren and rocky, without either tree or bu&s;h: when I was neare&s;t to it I &s;ounded and had forty-five fathom, with black muddy ground. To my great misfortune, my three Lieutenants and the Ma&s;ter were at this time &s;o ill as to be incapable of duty, though the re&s;t of the &s;hip's company were in good health. Our latitude was 45&deg; 21&prime; S., longitude 63&deg; 2&prime; W.; the variation 19&deg; 41&prime; E.</P>
<P>The next day I &s;haped my cour&s;e by the chart in the ac|count of Lord An&s;on's voyage,<MILESTONE N="Friday 16" UNIT="day"> for Cape Blanco. In the even|ing it blew extremely hard at S.

About &s;ix in the evening, having carried all the &s;ail I could, we made land, bearing about S. S. W. which as we had a good ob&s;ervation of the &s;un, we knew to be Cape Blanco; but it now began to blow with more violence than ever, and the &s;torm continued all night, with a &s;ea that was continually breaking over us, &s;o that the &s;hip laboured very much. At four in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 18" UNIT="day"> we &s;ounded and had forty fathom, with rocky ground; having &s;tood off in the night, we now wore and &s;tood in again, the &s;torm &s;till continuing with hail and &s;now: and about &s;ix o'clock we &s;aw the land again, bearing S. W. by W. The &s;hip was now &s;o light, that in a gale of wind &s;he drove bo|dily to leeward; &s;o that I was very &s;olicitous to get into Port De&s;ire, that I might put her hold in order, and take in &s;uffi|cient balla&s;t, to avoid the danger of being caught upon a lee &s;hore in her pre&s;ent trim. We &s;teered in for the land with the wind at N. E. and in the evening brought to; but the wind coming to the we&s;tward, we were driven off in the night. At &s;even the next morning, we &s;tood in again,<MILESTONE N="Monday 15" UNIT="day"> &s;teering S.

Cape Blanco at this time bore W. S.

I &s;tood into a bay to the &s;outhward of the Cape, as he directs, but could find no &s;uch place; I therefore &s;tood along the &s;hore to the &s;outh|ward,

the wind blowing off the land very hard,<MILESTONE N="Monday 19" UNIT="day"> and &s;aw &s;e|veral large columns of &s;moke ri&s;ing in many places, but no tree or bu&s;h, the country re&s;embling in appearance the bar|ren downs of England. We ob&s;erved al&s;o that the water was frequently very &s;hallow at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight miles from the &s;hore, for we had many times not more than ten fathom.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand along the &s;hore all day as near as po&s;&s;ible, and in the evening we &s;aw an i&s;land at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix leagues; <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 20" UNIT="day"> in the morning we &s;tood in for it, and found that it corre&s;ponded with Narborough's de&s;cription of Penguin i&s;land. As Port De&s;ire is &s;aid to lie about three leagues north we&s;t of this i&s;land, I &s;ent the boat to look for it, and when &s;he returned, having found it, I &s;tood in for the land. There were thou&s;ands of &s;eals and penguins about the &s;hip, and near Penguin I&s;land &s;everal &s;maller i&s;lands, or rather rocks. In the evening, we &s;aw a remarkable rock, ri&s;ing from the water like a &s;teeple, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the entrance of Port De&s;ire; this rock is an excellent mark to know the harbour, which it would otherwi&s;e be difficult to find. At night, there being little wind, we anchored at the di&s;tance of four or five miles from the &s;hore; and in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 21" UNIT="day"> with a breeze from the land, we turned up the harbour's mouth; we found it very narrow, with many rocks and &s;hoals about it, and the mo&s;t rapid tide I had ever known. I came to an anchor off the harbour in nine fa|thom, the entrance of the river being open, and bearing W. S. W.; Penguin I&s;land S. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant about three leagues; the Steeple rock S.

e&s;pecially as the de&s;criptions that have been given of this place, by the few who have already vi&s;ited it,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 21" UNIT="day"> are extremely defective. The wind blew very hard the greater part of this day, and there ran an ugly &s;ea where we were &s;tationed, yet I ordered out two boats to &s;ound the harbour, and attended in my own boat my&s;elf. We found it very narrow for near two miles, with a tide running at the rate of eight miles an hour: we found al&s;o many rocks and &s;hoals, but all the danger &s;hows it&s;elf above water. When we came to the &s;hore, I landed, and walked a little way into the country, which as far as I could &s;ee was all downs, without a &s;ingle tree or &s;hrub. We &s;aw the dung of many bea&s;ts, and had a glimp&s;e of four, which ran away as &s;oon as we came in &s;ight, &s;o that we could not certainly determine what they were; but we believed them to be Guanicoes, many of which we after|wards &s;aw come down to the water &s;ide: they re&s;emble our deer, but are much larger, the height of &s;ome being not le&s;s than thirteen hands; they are very &s;hy, and very &s;wift. After I returned to my boat, I went farther up the harbour, and landed upon an i&s;land that was covered with &s;eals, of which we killed above fifty, and among them many that were larger than a bullock, having before half loaded our boat with different kinds of birds, of which, and &s;eals, there are enough to &s;upply the navy of England. Among the birds one was very remarkable: the head re&s;embled that of an eagle, except that it had a large comb upon it; round the neck there was a white ruff, exactly re&s;embling a lady's tippet; the feathers on the back were as black as jet, and as bright as the fine&s;t poli&s;h could render that mineral: the legs were remarkably &s;trong and large, the talons were like tho&s;e of an eagle, except that they were not &s;o &s;harp, and the wings, when they were extended, mea&s;ured, from point to point, no le&s;s than twelve feet.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="72">The Tamar worked into the harbour with the tide of flood,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 21" UNIT="day"> but I kept my &s;tation with the Dolphin till I &s;hould have a leading wind, and the wind &s;hifting to the ea&s;tward, I weighed about five o'clock in the afternoon, intending to go up with the evening flood: before I could get under &s;ail, however, the wind &s;hifted again to N. W. by N.; and it being low water, the &s;hip lying but ju&s;t within the harbour, and there being no tide to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, we were obliged to anchor near the &s;outh &s;hore. The wind came off the land in very hard flaws, and in a &s;hort time, our anchor coming home, the &s;hip tailed on &s;hore again&s;t a &s;teep gravelly beach. The anchoring ground indeed as far as we had yet &s;ounded was bad, being very hard; &s;o that, in this &s;ituation, if the wind blows fre&s;h, there is always the greate&s;t rea&s;on to fear that the anchor &s;hould come home before the &s;hip can be brought up. While we were on &s;hore, it began to blow very hard, and the tide running like a &s;luice, it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that we could carry an anchor out to heave us off; however, after about four hours hard labour, this was ef|fected, and the &s;hip floated in the &s;tream. As there was only about &s;ix or &s;even feet of the after part of her that touched the ground, there was rea&s;on to hope that &s;he had &s;uffered no damage; however, I determined to unhang the rudder, that it might be examined.</P>
<P>During all this night and the next morning the wind blew with great violence; <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 22" UNIT="day"> we had let go out be&s;t bower anchor when we were near the &s;hore, in hopes it would have brought us up, and had not yet been able to weigh it. We now rode in a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation with our &s;mall bower, and that unfortunately came home again: we there|fore got a haw&s;er out of the Tamar, who lay in the &s;tream, and after weighing the &s;mall bower, we got out by her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,

<P>The next day we &s;ounded the harbour higher up,<MILESTONE N="Friday 23" UNIT="day"> and found the ground &s;ofter, and the water not &s;o deep; yet the wind continued to blow &s;o hard that we could not venture to change our &s;tation. We had found a &s;mall &s;pring of wa|ter about half a mile inland, upon the north &s;ide of the bay, but it had a bracki&s;h ta&s;te; I had al&s;o made another excur|&s;ion of &s;everal miles into the country, which I found barren and de&s;olate, in every direction, as far as the eye could reach. We had &s;een many guanicoes at a di&s;tance, but we could not get near enough to have a &s;hot at them; we tracked bea&s;ts of &s;everal kinds in the &s;oil, near a pond of &s;alt water, and among them a very large tyger: we found al&s;o a ne&s;t of o&s;triches eggs, which we eat, and thought very good. It is probable that all the animals which had left marks of their feet near the &s;alt pond, drank the water, and indeed we &s;aw no fre&s;h water for them. The &s;pring that we had found, which was not perfectly fre&s;h, was the only one of the kind that we had been able to di&s;cover; and for that we had been obliged to dig, there being no appearance of it except a &s;light moi&s;ture of the ground.</P>
<P>On the 24th, upon &s;lack water,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 24" UNIT="day"> we carried both the &s;hips higher up and moored them: the extreme points of the har|bour's mouth at low water bore from E. by S. &frac14; S. to E.; and the Steeple rock S. E. &frac14; E. We had here, at low water, but &s;ix fathom; but at &s;pring tides the water ri&s;es no le&s;s than four fathom and an half, which is &s;even and twenty feet. The tide indeed in this place is &s;uch as perhaps it is not in any other. It happened by &s;ome accident that one of our men fell overboard; the boats were all along&s;ide, and the man was an exceeding good &s;wimmer, yet before any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="18" REF="74">
could be &s;ent after him,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 24" UNIT="day"> the rapidity of the &s;tream had hurried him almo&s;t out of fight; we had however at la&s;t the good fortune to &s;ave him. This day I was again on &s;hore, and walked &s;ix or &s;even miles up the country: I &s;aw &s;everal hares as large as a fawn; I &s;hot one of them which weighed more than &s;ix and twenty pounds, and if I had had a good greyhound, I dare &s;ay the &s;hip's company might have lived upon hare two days in the week. In the mean time the people on board were bu&s;y in getting up all the cables upon deck, and clear|ing the hold, that a proper quantity of balla&s;t might be taken in, and the guns lowered into it, except a few which it might be thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep above.</P>
<P>On the 25th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 25" UNIT="day"> I went a good way up the harbour in the boat, and having landed on the north &s;ide, we &s;oon after found an old oar of a very &s;ingular make, and the barrel of a mu&s;quet, with the King's broad arrow upon it. The mu&s;|quet barrel had &s;uffered &s;o much from the weather, that it might be crumbled into du&s;t between the fingers: I ima|gined it had been left there by the Wager's people, or per|haps by Sir John Narborough. Hitherto we had found no kind of vegetables except a &s;pecies of wild peas; but though we had &s;een no inhabitants, we &s;aw places where they had made their fires, which however did not appear to be recent. While we were on &s;hore we &s;hot &s;ome wild ducks, and a hare; the hare ran two miles after he was wounded, though it appeared when he was taken up that a ball had pa&s;&s;ed quite through his body. I went this day many miles up the country, and had a long chace after one of the guanicoes, which was the large&s;t we had &s;een: he frequently &s;topped to look at us, when he had left us at a good di&s;tance behind, and made a noi&s;e that re&s;embled the neighing of a hor&s;e; but when we came pretty near him he &s;et out again, and at
<PB N="19" REF="75">
la&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 25" UNIT="day"> my dog being &s;o tired that he could not run him any longer, he got quite away from us, and we &s;aw him no more. We &s;hot a hare however, and a little ugly animal which &s;tunk &s;o intolerably that none of us could go near him. The fle&s;h of the hares here is as white as &s;now, and nothing can be better ta&s;ted. A Serjeant of marines, and &s;ome others who were on &s;hore at another part of the bay, had better &s;ucce&s;s than fell to our &s;hare, for they killed two old guanicoes and a fawn; they were however obliged to leave them where they fell, not being able to bring them down to the water &s;ide, near &s;ix miles, without farther a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, though they were but half the weight of tho&s;e that are mentioned by Sir John Narborough; &s;ome however I &s;aw which could not weigh le&s;s than &s;even or eight and thirty &s;tone, which is about three hundred pounds. When we returned in the evening it blew very hard, and the deck being &s;o full of lumber that we could not hoi&s;t the boats in, we moored them a&s;tern. About midnight, the &s;torm conti|nuing, our &s;ix oared cutter filled with water and broke adrift; the boat-keeper, by who&s;e neglect this accident hap|pened, being on board her, very narrowly e&s;caped drowning by catching hold of the &s;tern ladder. As it was tide of flood when &s;he went from the &s;hip, we knew that &s;he mu&s;t drive up the harbour; yet as the lo&s;s of her would be an irreme|diable misfortune, I &s;uffered much anxiety till I could &s;end after her in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 26" UNIT="day"> and it was then &s;ome hours before &s;he was brought back, having driven many miles with the &s;tream. In the mean time, I &s;ent another party to fetch the guanicoes which our people had &s;hot the night before; but they found nothing left except the bones, the tygers having eaten the fle&s;h, and even cracked the bones of the limbs to come at the marrow. Several of our people had been fifteen miles up the country in &s;earch of fre&s;h water,
<PB N="20" REF="76">
but could not find the lea&s;t rill:<MILESTONE N="Monday 26" UNIT="day"> we had &s;unk &s;everal wells to a con&s;iderable depth where the ground appeared moi&s;t, but upon vi&s;iting them, I had the mortification to find that, all together, they would not yield more than thirty gallons in twenty-four hours: this was a di&s;couraging circum&s;tance, e&s;pecially as our people, among other expedients, had watch|ed the guanicoes, and &s;een them drink at the &s;alt ponds. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> therefore determined to leave the place as &s;oon as the &s;hip could be got into a little order, and the &s;ix oared cutter re|paired, which had been hauled up upon the beach for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 27th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 27" UNIT="day"> &s;ome of our people, who had been a&s;hore on the north &s;ide of the bay to try for more guanicoes, found the &s;cull and bones of a man, which they brought off with them, and one young guanicoe alive, which we all agreed was one of the mo&s;t beautiful creatures we had ever &s;een: it &s;oon grew very tame, and would &s;uck our fingers like a calf; but, notwith&s;tanding all our care and contrivances to feed it, it died in a few days. In the afternoon of this day it blew &s;o hard that I was obliged to keep a con&s;iderable number of hands continually by the &s;heet anchor, as there was too much rea&s;on to fear that our cables would part, which however did not happen. In the mean time, &s;ome of our people that were on &s;hore with the carpenters, who were repairing the cutter on the &s;outh &s;ide of the bay, found two more &s;prings of tolerable water about two miles from the beach,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 28" UNIT="day"> in a direct line from the &s;hip's &s;tation. To the&s;e &s;prings I &s;ent twenty hands early in the morning with &s;ome &s;mall ca&s;ks called Barecas, and in a few turns they brought on board a tun of water, of which we began to be in great want. In the mean time, I went my&s;elf about twelve miles up the river in my boat, and the weather then growing bad,
<PB N="21" REF="77">
I went on &s;hore: the river, as far as I could &s;ee,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 28" UNIT="day"> was very broad; there were in it a number of i&s;lands, &s;ome of which were very large, and I make no doubt but that it penetrates the country for &s;ome hundreds of miles. It was upon one of the i&s;lands that I went on &s;hore, and I found there &s;uch a number of birds, that when they ro&s;e they literally darkened the &s;ky, and we could not walk a &s;tep without treading upon their eggs. As they kept hovering over our heads at a little di&s;tance, the men knocked down many of them with &s;tones and &s;ticks, and carried off &s;everal hundreds of their eggs. After &s;ome time, I left the i&s;land and landed upon the main, where our men dre&s;&s;ed and eat their eggs, though there were young birds in mo&s;t of them. I &s;aw no traces of inhabitants on either &s;ide of the river, but great numbers of guanicoes, in herds of &s;ixty or &s;eventy together: they would not however &s;uffer us to approach them, but &s;tood and gazed at us from the hills. In this excur&s;ion the Surgeon, who was of my party, &s;hot a tyger-cat, a &s;mall but very fierce animal; for though it was much wounded, it maintained a very &s;harp conte&s;t with my dog for a con&s;iderable time before it was killed.</P>
<P>On the 29th, we completed our balla&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 29" UNIT="day"> which the &s;trength of the tide, and the con&s;tant gales of wind rendered a very difficult and laborious ta&s;k: we al&s;o got on board another ton of water. On the morning of the 30th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 30" UNIT="day"> the weather was &s;o bad that we could not &s;end a boat on &s;hore; but employed all hands on board in &s;etting up the rigging. It grew more moderate however about noon, and I then &s;ent a boat to procure more water. The two men who fir&s;t came up to the well found there a large tyger lying upon the ground; having gazed at each other &s;ome time, the men, who had no fire-arms, &s;eeing the bea&s;t treat them with as

<P>On the 1&s;t of December,<MILESTONE N="December" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Saturday 1" UNIT="day"> our cutter being thoroughly re|paired, we took her on board, but the weather was &s;o bad that we could not get off any water: the next day we &s;truck the tents which had been &s;et up at the watering-place, and got all ready for &s;ea. The two wells from which we got our water bear about S. S. E. of the Steeple rock, from which they are di&s;tant about two miles and an half; but I fixed a mark near them, that they might be &s;till more ea&s;ily found than by their bearings. During our &s;tay in this harbour, we &s;ounded every part of it with great care, as high as a &s;hip could go, and found that there is no danger but what may be &s;een at low water; &s;o that now fre&s;h water is found, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from the beach, it would be a very conve|nient place for &s;hips to touch at, if it were not for the rapi|dity of the tide. The country about the bay abounds with guanicoes, and a great variety of wild fowl, particularly ducks, gee&s;e, widgeon, and &s;ea-pies, be&s;ides many others for which we have no name. Here is al&s;o &s;uch plenty of excellent mu&s;cles, that a boat may be loaded with them every time it is low water. Wood indeed is &s;carce, however in &s;ome parts of this coa&s;t there are bu&s;hes, which in a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity might produce a tolerable &s;upply of fuel.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as we were out of the bay, we &s;teered for Pepys' I&s;land, which is &s;aid to lie in latitude 47&deg; S. Our lati|tude was now 47&deg; 22&prime; S., longitude 65&deg; 49&prime; W.; Port De&s;ire bore S. 66 W. di&s;tant twenty-three leagues; and Pepys' I&s;land, according to Halley's Chart, E. &frac34; N. di&s;tant thirty-four leagues. The variation here was 19&deg; E.</P>
<P>We continued our cour&s;e the next day with a plea&s;ant gale and fine weather,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 6" UNIT="day"> &s;o that we began to think that this part of the world was not wholly without a &s;ummer.

The only per&s;on who pretends to have &s;een it, is Cowley, the account of who&s;e voyage is now before me; and all he &s;ays of its &s;ituation is, that it lies in latitude 47 S.; for he &s;ays nothing of its longitude: he &s;ays, indeed, that it has a fine harbour; but he adds, that
<PB N="24" REF="80">
the wind blew &s;o hard he could not get into it,<MILESTONE N="Friday 7" UNIT="day"> and that he therefore &s;tood away to the &s;outhward. At this time I al&s;o was &s;teering &s;outhward; for the weather being extremely fine, I could &s;ee very far to the northward of the &s;ituation in which it is laid down. As I &s;uppo&s;ed it mu&s;t lie to the ea&s;t|ward of us, if indeed it had any exi&s;tence, I made the Ta|mar's &s;ignal to &s;pread early in the afternoon; and as the weather continued to be very clear, we could &s;ee, between us, at lea&s;t twenty leagues. We &s;teered S. E. by the com|pa&s;s, and at night brought to, being by my account in lati|tude 47&deg; 18&prime; S.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 8" UNIT="day"> The next morning it blew very hard at N.

But a hard gale coming on, with a great &s;ea, I brought to about &s;ix o'clock in the evening under the main-&s;ail; <MILESTONE N="Sunday 9" UNIT="day"> and at &s;ix o'clock the next morning, the wind being at W.

We continued to &s;tand to the northward the next day under our cour&s;es,<MILESTONE N="Monday 10" UNIT="day"> with a hard gale from S. W. to N. W. and a great &s;ea. At night, being in latitude 46&deg; 50&prime; S., I wore &s;hip, and &s;tood in to the we&s;tward again, our &s;hips having &s;pread every day as far as they could be &s;een by each other: and on the 11th at noon,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> being now certain that there could be no &s;uch i&s;land as is mentioned by Cowley, and laid down by Halley under the name of Pepys' I&s;land, I re&s;olved to &s;tand in for the main, and take in wood and water, of which both &s;hips were in great want, at the fir&s;t convenient place I could

find, e&s;pecially as the &s;ea&s;on was advancing very fa&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> and we had no time to lo&s;e. From this time we continued to haul in for the land as the winds would permit, and kept a look-out for the i&s;lands of Sebald de Wert, which, by all the charts we had on board, could not be far from our track: a great number of birds were every day about the &s;hip, and large whales were continually &s;wimming by her. The weather in general was fine, but very cold, and we all agreed, notwith&s;tanding the hope we had once formed, that the only difference between the middle of &s;ummer here, and the middle of winter in England, lies in the length of the days. On Saturday the 15th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 15" UNIT="day"> being in latitude 50&deg; 33&prime; S. longitude 66&deg; 59&prime; W. we were overtaken about &s;ix in the even|ing by the harde&s;t gale at S. W. that I was ever in, with a &s;ea &s;till higher than any I had &s;een in going round Cape Horn with Lord An&s;on: I expected every moment that it would fill us, our &s;hip being much too deep wai&s;ted for &s;uch a voyage: it would have been &s;afe&s;t to put before it under our bare poles, but our &s;tock of fre&s;h water was not &s;ufficient, and I was afraid of being driven &s;o far off the land as not to be able to recover it before the whole was exhau&s;ted; we therefore lay to under a balanced mizen, and &s;hipped many heavy &s;eas, though we found our &s;kreen bulk-heads of in|finite &s;ervice.</P>

next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 19" UNIT="day"> however, it being northerly, I &s;tood in to a deep bay, at the bottom of which there appeared to be a harbour, but I found it barred, the &s;ea breaking quite from one &s;ide of it to the other; and at low water I could perceive that it was rocky, and almo&s;t all dry: the water was &s;hoal at a good di&s;tance from it, and I was in &s;ix fathom before I &s;tood out again. In this place there &s;eemed to be plenty of fi&s;h, and we &s;aw many porpoi&s;es &s;wimming after them, that were as white as &s;now, with black &s;pots; a very uncommon and beautiful &s;ight.

<P>At break of day, on the 20th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 20" UNIT="day"> we were off Cape Fair-weather, which bore about we&s;t at the di&s;tance of four leagues, and we had here but thirteen fathom water, &s;o that it appears nece&s;&s;ary to give that Cape a good birth. From this place I ran clo&s;e in &s;hore to Cape Virgin Mary, but I found the coa&s;t to lie S. S. E. very different from Sir John Narborough's de&s;cription, and a long &s;pit of &s;and running to the &s;outhward of the Cape for above a league: in the evening I worked up clo&s;e to this &s;pit of &s;and, having &s;een many guanicoes feeding in the vallies as we went along, and a great &s;moke all the afternoon, about four or five leagues up the &s;treight, upon the north &s;hore.

to be white handkerchiefs,<MILESTONE N="Friday 21" UNIT="day"> inviting them to come on &s;hore, which they were very de&s;irous to have done, but it blew &s;o hard that they were obliged to &s;tand out to &s;ea. Bulkeley, the Gunner of the Wager, who has publi&s;hed &s;ome account of her voyage, &s;ays, that they were in doubt whether the&s;e people were Europeans who had been &s;hip|wrecked upon the coa&s;t, or native inhabitants of the coun|try about the river Gallagoes. Ju&s;t as we came to an anchor, I &s;aw with my gla&s;s exactly what was &s;een by the people in the Wager, a number of hor&s;emen riding backward and forward, directly abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, and waving &s;omewhat white, as an invitation to us to come on &s;hore. As I was very de&s;irous to know what the&s;e people were, I ordered out my twelve oar'd boat, and went towards the beach, with Mr. Mar&s;hall, my Second Lieutenant, and a party of men, very well armed; Mr. Gumming, my Fir&s;t Lieutenant, fol|lowing in the &s;ix oar'd cutter. When we came within a little di&s;tance of the &s;hore, we &s;aw, as near as I can gue&s;s, about five hundred people, &s;ome on foot, but the greater part on hor&s;eback: they drew up upon a &s;toney &s;pit, which ran a good way into the &s;ea, and upon which it was very bad landing, for the water was &s;hallow, and the &s;tones very large. The people on &s;hore kept waving and hallooing, which, as we under&s;tood, were invitations to land; I could not perceive that they had any weapons among them, how|ever I made &s;igns that they &s;hould retire to a little di&s;tance, with which they immediately complied: they continued to &s;hout with great vociferation, and in a &s;hort time we landed, though not without great difficulty, mo&s;t of the boat's crew being up to the middle in water. I drew up my people upon the beach, with my officers at their head, and gave orders that none of them &s;hould move from that &s;tation, till I &s;hould either call or beckon to them. I then went forward
<PB N="28" REF="85">
alone,<MILESTONE N="Friday 21" UNIT="day"> towards the Indians, but perceiving that they retired as I advanced, I made &s;igns that one of them &s;hould come near: as it happened, my &s;ignals were under&s;tood, and one of them, who afterwards appeared to be a Chief, came towards me: he was of a gigantic &s;tature, and &s;eemed to realize the tales of mon&s;ters in a human &s;hape: he had the &s;kin of &s;ome wild bea&s;t thrown over his &s;houlders, as a Scotch Highlander wears his plaid, and was painted &s;o as to make the mo&s;t hideous appearance I ever beheld: round one eye was a large circle of white, a circle of black &s;urrounded the other, and the re&s;t of his face was &s;treaked with paint of different colours; I did not mea&s;ure him, but if I may judge of his height by the proportion of his &s;tature to my own, it could not be much le&s;s than &s;even feet. When this fright|ful Colo&s;&s;us came up, we muttered &s;omewhat to each other as a &s;alutation, and I then walked with him towards his companions, to whom, as I advanced, I made &s;igns that they &s;hould &s;it down, and they all readily complied: there were among them many women, who &s;eemed to be pro|portionably large; and few of the men were le&s;s than the Chief who had come forward to meet me. I had heard their voices very loud at a di&s;tance, and when I came near, I per|ceived a good number of very old men, who were chanting &s;ome unintelligible words in the mo&s;t doleful cadence I ever heard, with an air of &s;erious &s;olemnity, which inclined me to think that it was a religious ceremony: they were all painted and clothed nearly in the &s;ame manner; the circles round the two eyes were in no in&s;tance of one colour, but they were not univer&s;ally black and white, &s;ome being white and red, and &s;ome red and black; their teeth were as white as ivory, remarkably even and well &s;et; but except the &s;kins, which they wore with the hair inwards, mo&s;t of them were naked, a few only having upon their legs a kind of

Having looked round upon the&s;e enormous goblins with no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment, and with &s;ome difficulty made tho&s;e that were &s;till galloping up &s;it down with the re&s;t, I took out a quantity of yellow and white beads, which I di&s;tributed among them, and which they received with very &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure: I then took out a whole piece of green &s;ilk riband, and giving the end of it into the hands of one of them, I made the per&s;on that &s;at next take hold of it, and &s;o on as far as it would reach: all this while they &s;at very quietly, nor did any of tho&s;e that held the riband attempt to pull it from the re&s;t, though I perceived that they were &s;till more delighted, with it, than with the beads. While the riband was thus extended, I took out a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and cut it between each two of the Indians that held it, &s;o that I left about a yard in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every one, which I afterwards tied about their heads, where they &s;uffered it to remain without &s;o much as touching it while I was with them. Their peaceable and orderly beha|viour on this occa&s;ion certainly did them honour, e&s;pecially as my pre&s;ents could not extend to the whole company: neither impatience to &s;hare the new finery, nor curio&s;ity to gain a nearer view of me and what I was doing, brought any one of them from the &s;tation that I had allotted him. It would be very natural for tho&s;e who have read Gay's fables, if they form an idea of an Indian almo&s;t naked, returning to his fellows in the woods adorned with European trinkets, to think of the monkey that had &s;een the world; yet before we de&s;pi&s;e their fondne&s;s for gla&s;s, beads, ribands, and other things, which among up are held in no e&s;timation, we &s;hould con&s;ider that, in them&s;elves, the ornaments of &s;avage and civil life are equal, and that tho&s;e who live nearly in a &s;tate of nature, have nothing that re&s;embles gla&s;s, &s;o much

as gla&s;s re&s;embles a diamond; <MILESTONE N="Friday 21" UNIT="day"> the value which we &s;et upon a diamond, therefore, is more capricious than the value which they &s;et upon gla&s;s. The love of ornament &s;eems to be a univer&s;al principle in human nature, and the &s;plendid tran&s;parency of gla&s;s, and the regular figure of a bead, are among the qualities that by the con&s;titution of our nature excite plea&s;ing ideas; and although in one of the&s;e qualities the diamond excels gla&s;s, its value is much more than in proportion to the difference: the plea&s;ure which it gives among us is, principally, by conferring di&s;tinction, and gratifying vanity, which is independant of natural ta&s;te, that is gratified by certain hues and figures, to which for that rea&s;on we give the name of beauty: it mu&s;t be remembered al&s;o, that an Indian is more di&s;tingui&s;hed by a gla&s;s button or a bead, than any individual among us by a diamond, though perhaps the &s;ame &s;acrifice is not made to his vanity, as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his finery is rather a te&s;timony of his good fortune, than of his influence or power in con&s;equence of his having what, as the common medium of all earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, is &s;uppo&s;ed to confer virtual &s;uperiority, and in|trin&s;ic advantage. The people, however, whom I had now adorned, were not wholly &s;trangers to European commodi|ties, for upon a clo&s;er attention, I perceived among them one woman who had bracelets either of bra&s;s, or very pale gold, upon her arms, and &s;ome beads of blue gla&s;s, &s;trung upon two long queues of hair, which being parted at the top, hung down over each &s;houlder before her: &s;he was of a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize, and her face was, if po&s;&s;ible, more frightfully painted than the re&s;t. I had a great de&s;ire to learn where &s;he got her beads and bracelets, and enquired by all the &s;igns I could devi&s;e, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to make my&s;elf under&s;tood. One of the men &s;hewed me the bowl of a tobacco pipe, which was made of a red earth, but

I &s;oon found that they had no tobacco among them; <MILESTONE N="Friday 21" UNIT="day"> and this per&s;on made me under&s;tand that he wanted &s;ome: upon this I beckoned to my people, who remained upon the beach, drawn up as I had left them, and three or four of them ran forward, imagining that I wanted them. The Indians, who, as I had ob&s;erved, kept their eyes almo&s;t con|tinually upon them, no &s;ooner &s;aw &s;ome of them advance, than they all ro&s;e up with a great clamour, and were leaving the place, as I &s;uppo&s;ed to get their arms, which were pro|bably left at a little di&s;tance: to prevent mi&s;chief, therefore, and put an end to the alarm, which had thus accidentally been &s;pread among them, I ran to meet the people who were, in con&s;equence of my &s;ignal, coming from the beach, and as &s;oon as I was within hearing I hallooed to them, and told them that I would have only one come up with all the tobacco that he could collect from the re&s;t. As &s;oon as the Indians &s;aw this, they recovered from their &s;urprize, and every one returned to his &s;tation, except a very old man, who came up to me, and &s;ung a long &s;ong, which I much re|gretted my not being able to under&s;tand: before the &s;ong was well fini&s;hed, Mr. Cumming came up with the tobacco, and I could not but &s;mile at the a&s;toni&s;hment which I &s;aw expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance, upon perceiving him&s;elf, though &s;ix feet two inches high, become at once a pigmy among giants; for the&s;e people may indeed more properly be called giants than tall men: of the few among us who are full &s;ix feet high, &s;carcely any are broad and mu&s;cular in proportion to their &s;tature, but look rather like men of the common bulk, run up accidentally to an unu&s;ual height; and a man who &s;hould mea&s;ure only &s;ix feet two inches, and equally exceed a &s;tout well-&s;et man of the com|mon &s;tature in breadth and mu&s;cle, would &s;trike us rather as being of a gigantic race, than as an individual accidentally

During our pantomimical conference, an old man often laid his head down upon the &s;tones, and &s;hutting his eyes for about half a minute, afterwards pointed fir&s;t to his mouth, and then to the hills, meaning, as I imagined, that if I would &s;tay with them till the morning, they would furni&s;h me with &s;ome provi&s;ions, but this offer I was obliged to decline. When I left them, not one of them offered to follow us, but as long as I could &s;ee them, continued to &s;it quietly in their places.

<P>SOON after I returned on board, I got under way,<MILESTONE N="Friday 21" UNIT="day"> and worked up the Streight, which is here about nine leagues broad, with the flood, not with a view to pa&s;s through it, but in &s;earch of &s;ome place where I might get a &s;upply of wood and water, not chu&s;ing to tru&s;t wholly to the finding of Falkland's I&s;lands, which I determined afterwards to &s;eek. About eight in the evening, the tide of ebb beginning to make, I anchored in five and twenty fathom. Point Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion bore N. N. E. at about three miles di&s;tance, and &s;ome re|markable hummocks on the north, which Bulkeley, from their appearance, has called the A&s;&s;es Ears, W. &frac12; N.</P>
<P>At three in the morning, of the 22d,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 22" UNIT="day"> we weighed with the wind at E. and &s;teered S. W. by W. about twelve miles. During this cour&s;e we went over a bank, of which no notice has hitherto been taken: at one time we had but &s;ix fathom and a half, but in two or three ca&s;ts we had thirteen. When our water was &s;hallowe&s;t, the A&s;&s;es Ears bore N. W. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant three leagues, and the north point of the fir&s;t Narrow W. by S. di&s;tant between five and &s;ix miles. We then &s;teered S. W. by S. near &s;ix miles to the entrance of the fir&s;t Narrow, and afterwards S. S. W. about &s;ix miles, which brought us through: the tide here was &s;o &s;trong, that the pa&s;&s;age was very rapid. During this cour&s;e we &s;aw a &s;ingle

As &s;oon as we had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Narrow, we entered a little &s;ea, for we did not come in &s;ight of the entrance of the &s;econd Narrow till we had run two leagues. The di&s;tance from the fir&s;t to the &s;econd Narrow is about eight leagues, and the cour&s;e S. W. by W. The land is very high on the north &s;ide of the &s;econd Narrow, which continues for about five leagues, and we &s;teered through it S. W. &frac12; W. with &s;oundings from twenty to five and twenty fathom: we went out of the we&s;t end of this Narrow about noon, and &s;teered &s;outh about three leagues for Elizabeth's i&s;land; but the wind then coming right again&s;t us, we anchored in &s;even fathom. The i&s;land bore S. S. E. di&s;tant about a mile, and Bartholomew's I&s;land bore E. S. E. In the evening, &s;ix Indians upon the I&s;land came down to the water &s;ide, and continued waving and hallooing to us for a long time; but as my people wanted re&s;t, I was unwilling to employ them in hoi&s;ting out a boat, and the Indians &s;eeing their labour fruitle&s;s, at length went away. While we were &s;teering from Point Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the fir&s;t Narrow, the flood &s;et to the &s;outhward, but as &s;oon as we entered the Narrow, it &s;et &s;trongly over to the north &s;hore: it flows here at the full and change of the moon about ten o'clock. Between the fir&s;t and the &s;econd Narrow the flood &s;ets to the S. W. and the ebb to the N. E.: after the we&s;t end of the &s;econd Narrow is pa&s;t, the cour&s;e, with a leading wind, is S. by E. three leagues. Between the i&s;lands of Elizabeth and Saint Bartholomew, the channel is about half a mile over, and the water is deep: we found the flood &s;et very &s;trongly to the &s;outhward, with a great rippling, but round the I&s;lands the tides &s;et many different ways.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="92">In the morning of the 23d,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 23" UNIT="day"> we weighed with the wind at S. by W. and worked between Elizabeth and Bartholomew's i&s;land: before the tide was &s;pent, we got over upon the north &s;hore, and anchored in ten fathom. Saint George's I&s;land then bore N. E. by N. di&s;tant three leagues; a point of land, which I called PORPOIS POINT, N. by W. di&s;tant about five miles; and the &s;outhermo&s;t land S. by E. di&s;tant about two miles. In the evening, we weighed and &s;teered S. by E. about five miles along the north &s;hore, at about one mile's di&s;tance, with regular &s;oundings, from &s;even to thirteen fa|thom, and every where good ground. At ten o'clock at night, we anchored in thirteen fathom; Sandy Point then bearing S. by E. di&s;tant four miles; Porpois Point W. N. W. three leagues; and Saint George's I&s;land N. E. four leagues. All along this &s;hore the flood &s;ets to the &s;outhward; at the full and change of the moon, it flows about eleven o'clock, and the water ri&s;es about fifteen feet.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 24" UNIT="day"> I went out in my boat in &s;earch of Fre&s;h Water Bay; I landed with my Second Lieutenant upon Sandy Point, and having &s;ent the boat along the &s;hore, we walked abrea&s;t of her. Upon the Point we found plenty of wood, and very good water, and for four or five miles the &s;hore was exceedingly plea&s;ant. Over the Point there is a fine level country, with a &s;oil that, to all appearance, is extremely rich; for the ground was covered with flowers of various kinds, that perfumed the air with their fragrance; and among them there were berries, almo&s;t innumerable, where the blo&s;&s;oms had been &s;hed: we ob&s;erved that the gra&s;s was very good, and that it was intermixed with a great number of peas in blo&s;&s;om. Among this luxuriance of herbage we &s;aw many hundreds of birds feeding, which from their form, and the uncommon beauty of their plumage, we called
<PB N="36" REF="93">
painted gee&s;e.<MILESTONE N="Monday 24" UNIT="day"> We walked more than twelve miles, and found great plenty of fine fre&s;h water, but not the bay that we &s;ought; for we &s;aw no part of the &s;hore, in all our walk from Sandy Point, where a boat could land without the utmo&s;t hazard, the water being every where &s;hoal, and the &s;ea breaking very high. We fell in with a great number of the huts or wigwams of the Indians, which appeared to have been very lately de&s;erted, for in &s;ome of them the fires which they had kindled were &s;carcely extingui&s;hed; they were in little rece&s;&s;es of the woods, and always clo&s;e to fre&s;h water. In many places we found plenty of wild celery, and a variety of plants, which probably would be of great benefit to &s;eamen after a long voyage. In the evening, we walked back again, and found the &s;hips at anchor in Sandy Point Bay, at the di&s;tance of about half a mile from the &s;hore. The keen air of this place made our people &s;o vora|ciou&s;ly hungry that they could have eaten three times their allowance; I was therefore very glad to find &s;ome of them employed in hauling the &s;eine, and others on &s;hore with their guns: &s;ixty very large mullets were ju&s;t taken with the &s;eine, as I came up; and the gunners had good &s;port, for the place abounded with gee&s;e, teale, &s;nipes, and other birds, that were excellent food.</P>
<P>On the 25th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> Chri&s;tmas day, we ob&s;erved by two altitudes, and found the latitude of Sandy Point to be 53&deg; 10&prime; S. At eight in the morning, we weighed, and having &s;ailed five leagues from Sandy Point, in the direction of S. by E. &frac12; E. we anchored again in thirty-two fathom, about a mile from the &s;hore; the &s;outh point of Fre&s;h Water Bay then bearing N. N. W. di&s;tant about four miles; and the &s;outhermo&s;t land S. E. by S. As we &s;ailed along the &s;hore, at about two miles di&s;tance, we had no ground with &s;ixty fathom; but at the di&s;tance of one mile, we had from twenty to thirty-two fa|thom.
<PB N="37" REF="94">
At the full and change of the moon,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> the tide flows off Fre&s;h Water Bay at twelve o'clock; it runs but little, yet flows very much by the &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 26th, at eight o'clock in the morning, we weighed,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 26" UNIT="day"> with the wind at E. N. E. and &s;teered S. S. E. for Port Famine. At noon, St. Anne's Point, which is the northermo&s;t point of that port, bore S. by E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant three leagues. Along this &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles, we had very deep water; but within a mile had ground with twenty-five or thirty fathom. From St. Anne's Point a reef of rocks runs out S. E. by E. about two miles; and at the di&s;tance of two cables length from this reef the water will &s;uddenly &s;hoal from &s;ixty-five to thirty-five and twenty fa|thom. The Point it&s;elf is very &s;teep, &s;o that there is no &s;ounding till it is approached very near, and great care mu&s;t be taken in &s;tanding into Port Famine, e&s;pecially if the &s;hip is as far &s;outhward as Sedger river; for the water will &s;hoal at once from thirty to twenty, fifteen, and twelve fathom; and at about two cables length farther in, at more than a mile from the &s;hore, there is but nine feet water, when the tide is out. By hauling clo&s;e round St. Anne's Point, &s;ound|ings will &s;oon be got; and as the water &s;hoals very fa&s;t, it is not &s;afe to go farther in, when there is no more than &s;even fathom; the &s;treight here is not more than four leagues wide.</P>
<P>The next day at noon, having had little wind, and calms,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 27" UNIT="day"> we anchored in Port Famine, clo&s;e to the &s;hore, and found our &s;ituation very &s;afe and convenient: we had &s;helter from all winds except the S. E. which &s;eldom blows, and if a &s;hip &s;hould be driven a&s;hore in the bottom of the bay, &s;he could receive no damage, for it is all fine &s;oft ground. We found drift wood here &s;ufficient to have furni&s;hed a thou&s;and &s;ail,
<PB N="38" REF="94">
&s;o that we had no need to take the trouble of cutting green.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 27" UNIT="day"> The water of Sedger river is excellent, but the boats cannot get in till about two hours flood, becau&s;e at low water it is very &s;hallow for about three quarters of a mile. I went up it about four miles in my boat, and the fallen trees then rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to go farther: I found it, indeed, not only difficult but dangerous to get up thus far. The &s;tream is very rapid, and many &s;tumps of trees lie hidden under it: one of the&s;e made its way through the bottom of my boat, and in an in&s;tant &s;he was full of water. We got on &s;hore as well as we could; and afterwards, with great difficulty, hauled her up upon the &s;ide of the river: here we contrived to &s;top the hole in her bottom, &s;o as that we made a &s;hift to get her down to the river's mouth, where &s;he was &s;oon properly repaired by the carpenter. On each &s;ide of this river there are the fine&s;t trees I ever &s;aw, and I make no doubt but that they would &s;upply the Briti&s;h navy with the be&s;t ma&s;ts in the world. Some of them are of a great height, and more than eight feet in diameter, which is pro|portionably more than eight yards in circumference; &s;o that four men, joining hand in hand, could not compa&s;s them: among others, we found the pepper tree, or winter's bark, in great plenty. Among the&s;e woods, notwith&s;tanding the coldne&s;s of the climate, there are innumerable parrots, and other birds of the mo&s;t beautiful plumage. I &s;hot every day gee&s;e and ducks enough to &s;erve my own table and &s;e|veral others, and every body on board might have done the &s;ame: we had indeed great plenty of fre&s;h provi&s;ions of all kinds; for we caught as much fi&s;h every day as &s;erved the companies of both &s;hips. As I was much on &s;hore here, I tracked many wild bea&s;ts in the &s;and, but never &s;aw one; we al&s;o found many huts or wigwams, but never met with an Indian. The country between this Port and Cape For|ward,
<PB N="39" REF="96">
which is di&s;tant about four leagues, is extremely fine; <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 27" UNIT="day"> the &s;oil appears to be very good, and there are no le&s;s than three pretty large rivers, be&s;ides &s;everal brooks.</P>
<P>While we lay here, I went one day to Cape Forward, and when I &s;et out I intended to have gone farther; but the wea|ther became &s;o bad, with heavy rain, that we were glad to &s;top there, and make a great fire to dry our clothes, which were wet through. From the place where we &s;topped, the Indians had been gone &s;o lately, that the wood, which lay half burnt, where they had made their fire, was &s;till warm; and &s;oon after our fire was kindled, we perceived that another was kindled directly oppo&s;ite to it, on the Terra del Fuego &s;hore; probably as a &s;ignal, which, if we had been Indians, we &s;hould have under&s;tood. After we were dried and refre&s;hed at our fire, the rain having abated, I walked cro&s;s the Cape, to &s;ee how the Streight ran, which I found to be about W. N. W. The hills, as far as I could &s;ee, were of an immen&s;e height, very craggy, and covered with &s;now quite from the &s;ummit to the ba&s;e. I made al&s;o another excur&s;ion along the &s;hore to the north|ward, and found the country for many miles exceedingly plea&s;ant, the ground being, in many places, covered with flowers, which were not inferior to tho&s;e that are commonly found in our gardens, either in beauty or fragrance; and if it were not for the &s;everity of the cold in winter, this coun|try might, in my opinion, be made, by cultivation, one of the fine&s;t in the world. I had &s;et up a &s;mall tent at the bot|tom of this bay, clo&s;e to a little rivulet, and ju&s;t at the &s;kirts of a wood, &s;oon after the &s;hip came to an anchor, where three men were employed in wa&s;hing: they &s;lept on &s;hore; but &s;oon after &s;un&s;et were awakened out of their fir&s;t &s;leep by the roaring of &s;ome wild bea&s;ts, which the darkne&s;s of the night, and the &s;olitarine&s;s of their &s;ituation in this path|le&s;s

From this time &s;leep was renounced for the night, a large fire was immediately kindled, and a con&s;tant blaze kept up: this prevented the bea&s;ts from invading the tent; but they continued to prowl round it at a little di&s;tance, with ince&s;&s;ant howlings, till the day broke, and then, to the great comfort of the affrighted &s;ailors, they di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>At this place, not far from where the &s;hip lay, there is a hill that has been cleared of wood, and we &s;uppo&s;ed this to be the &s;pot where the Spaniards formerly had a &s;ettlement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;ome account of this &s;ettlement in the Voyage of Captain Wallis, chap. iii. p. 411.</NOTE>.

W. by N. four leagues, and then three leagues north, between Elizabeth and Bartholomew i&s;lands: we then &s;teered from the i&s;lands N. by E. three leagues, to the &s;econd Narrow; and &s;teered through N. E. &frac12; E. continu|ing the &s;ame cour&s;e from the &s;econd Narrow to the fir&s;t, which was a run of eight leagues. As the wind &s;till conti|nued to blow fre&s;h, we &s;teered through the fir&s;t Narrow again&s;t the flood, in the direction of N. N. E.; but about ten o'clock at night, the wind dying away, the flood &s;et us back again into the entrance of the fir&s;t Narrow, where we were obliged to anchor, in forty fathom, within two cables length of the &s;hore. The tide flows here, at the full and change of the moon, about two o'clock, and runs full &s;ix knots an hour.</P>
<P>At one o'clock the next morning, we weighed,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 6" UNIT="day"> with a light northerly breeze; and about three, we pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Nar|row a &s;econd time. Having now &s;een the &s;hip &s;afe through, and being quite exhau&s;ted with fatigue, as I had been upon the deck all the preceding day, and all night, I went into my cabbin to get &s;ome re&s;t. I lay down, and &s;oon fell a&s;leep;
<PB N="42" REF="100">
but in le&s;s than half an hour,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 6" UNIT="day"> I was awakened by the beat|ing of the &s;hip upon a bank: I in&s;tantly &s;tarted up, and ran upon the deck, where I &s;oon found that we had grounded upon a hard &s;and. It was happy for us, that at this time it was &s;tark calm; and I immediately ordered out the boats to carry an anchor a&s;tern, where the water was deepe&s;t: the anchor took the ground, but before we could work the cap|&s;tern, in order to heave the &s;hip off to it, &s;he went off, by the mere ri&s;ing of the tide. It happened fortunately to be ju&s;t low water when &s;he went aground, and there was fifteen feet forward, and &s;ix fathom a very little way a&s;tern. The Ma&s;ter told me, that at the la&s;t ca&s;t of the lead, before we were aground, he had thirteen fathom; &s;o that the water &s;hoaled at once no le&s;s than &s;ixty-three feet.</P>
<P>This bank, which has not been mentioned by any navi|gator who has pa&s;&s;ed the Streight, is extremely dangerous; e&s;pecially as it lies directly in the fair way between Cape Virgin Mary and the fir&s;t Narrow, and ju&s;t in the middle be|tween the &s;outh and north &s;hores. It is more than two leagues long, and full as broad; in many places al&s;o it is very &s;teep. When we were upon it, Point Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion bore N. E. di&s;tant three leagues; and the entrance of the narrow S. W. di&s;tant two leagues. I afterwards &s;aw many parts of it dry, and the &s;ea breaking very high over other parts of it, where the water was &s;hallow. A &s;hip that &s;hould ground upon this &s;hoal in a gale of wind, would probably be very &s;oon beaten to pieces.</P>
<P>About &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we anchored in fifteen fathom, the &s;hoal bearing N. N. W. &frac12; W. at the di&s;tance of about half a mile. At noon, we weighed with a light breeze at N. E. and worked with the ebb tide till two, but finding the water &s;hoal, we anchored again in &s;ix fathom and an

half,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 6" UNIT="day"> at about the di&s;tance of half a mile from the &s;outh &s;ide of the &s;hoal. The A&s;&s;es Ears then bearing N. W. by W. di&s;tant four leagues, and the &s;outh point of the entrance of the fir&s;t Narrow W. S. W. di&s;tant about three leagues. At this time the opening of the Narrow was &s;hut in, and upon &s;ending out the boats to &s;ound, they di&s;covered a channel between the &s;hoal and the &s;outh &s;hore of the Streight. The Tamar in the mean time, as &s;he was endeavouring to come near us, was very near going on &s;hore, having once got into three fathom, but &s;oon after came to an anchor in the chan|nel between the &s;hoal and the north &s;hore.</P>
<P>The next morning, about eight o'clock, we weighed,<MILESTONE N="Monday 7" UNIT="day"> with little wind at W. S. W. and &s;teered about half a mile S. E. by E. when, having deepened our water to thirteen fathom, we &s;teered between the E. and E. N. E. along the &s;outh &s;ide of the &s;hoal, at the di&s;tance of about &s;even miles from the &s;outh &s;hore, keeping two boats at &s;ome di&s;tance, one on each bow, to &s;ound. The depth of water was very irregular, varying continually between nine and fifteen fathom; and upon hauling nearer to the &s;hoal, we had very &s;oon no more than &s;even fathom: the boats went over a bank, upon which they had &s;ix fathom and an half; it being then low water, but within the bank they had thirteen fathom. At noon, we were to the ea&s;tward of the &s;hoal, and as we hauled over to the north &s;hore, we &s;oon deepened our water to twenty fathom. Point Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at this time bore N. N. W. di&s;tant between four and five leagues, the A&s;&s;es Ears W. N. W. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, and Cape Virgin Mary N. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant about &s;even leagues. From this &s;ituation we &s;teered N. E. by E. for the &s;outh end of the &s;pit which runs to the &s;outhward of the Cape, and had no &s;oundings with five and twenty fathom. At four in the afternoon, Cape Virgin Mary bore N. E. and the &s;outh end of the &s;pit N. E. by E. di&s;tant three leagues. At

We now brought to for the Tamar, who had come through the north channel, and was &s;ome leagues a&s;tern of us, and while we were waiting for her coming up, the officer of the watch informed me that the head of the main-ma&s;t was &s;prung: I immediately went up to look at it my&s;elf, and found it &s;plit almo&s;t in a &s;trait line perpendicularly for a con&s;iderable length, but I could not di&s;cover exactly how far the fi&s;&s;ure went, for the cheeks that were upon the ma&s;t. We imagined this to have hap|pened in the very hard gale that had overtaken us &s;ome time before, but as it was of more importance to contrive how to repair the damage, than di&s;cover how it happened, we im|mediately put on a &s;trong fi&s;h, and woolded it &s;o well, that we had rea&s;on to hope the ma&s;t would be as &s;erviceable as ever.

As &s;oon as I had made this di&s;covery, I tacked and &s;tood out again, and at the &s;ame time &s;aw land a great way to the &s;outhward, which I made no doubt was the &s;ame that is mentioned in the charts by the name of the New I&s;lands. As I was haul|ing out of this bay, I &s;aw a long, low &s;hoal of rocks, &s;tretching out for more than a league to the northward of us, and another of the &s;ame kind lying between that and what we had taken for the northermo&s;t of De Wert's i&s;lands. This land, except the low part, which is not &s;een till it is approached near, con&s;i&s;ts of high, craggy, barren rocks, which in appearance very much re&s;emble Staten Land. When I had got to near as to di&s;cover the low land, I was quite embayed, and if it had blown hard at S.

The &s;eals and birds here are innumerable; we &s;aw al&s;o many whales &s;pouting about us, &s;everal of which were of an enormous &s;ize. Our latitude now was 51&deg; 27&prime; S., longitude 63&deg; 54&prime; W.; the variation was 23&deg; 30&prime; E.

<P>On Monday the 14th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 14" UNIT="day"> the weather having cleared up, and the wind &s;hifted to the S. S. W. we &s;teered along the &s;hore S.

This i&s;land is about three leagues di&s;tant from the land we were coa&s;ting, which here forms a very deep bay, and bears E. by N. of the other i&s;land on which we had &s;een the long tufts of gra&s;s: we &s;aw the &s;ea break at a good di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and during the night &s;tood off and on. The next morning at three o'clock we made &s;ail, and &s;tood in for the land to look for a harbour.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> At &s;ix, the ea&s;t end of the rocky i&s;land bore W. S.

<PB N="47" REF="105">
then were &s;ixteen fathom, with rocky ground,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> but when we got within the i&s;land we had twenty fathom, with fine white &s;and. The coa&s;t from this rocky i&s;land lies E. by S. di&s;tant about &s;even or eight leagues, where there are two low i&s;lands, which make the ea&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight. At eight o'clock we &s;aw an opening, which had the appearance of an harbour, bearing E. S. E. and being be|tween two and three leagues di&s;tant. Upon this di&s;covery we brought to, and &s;ent a boat from each of the &s;hips to ex|amine the opening; but it beginning to blow very hard &s;oon after, and the weather growing thick, with heavy rain, we were obliged to &s;tand out to &s;ea with both the &s;hips, and it was not without great difficulty that we cleared the two rocky i&s;lands which were to the ea&s;tward of us. We had now a great &s;ea, and I began to be under much concern le&s;t we &s;hould be blown off, and our people in the boats left behind: however, about three in the afternoon, the weather clearing up, I tacked and &s;tood in again, and pre|&s;ently after had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee one of the boats, though it was a long way to leeward of us. I immediately bore down to her, and found her to be the Tamar's boat, with Mr. Hindman, the Second Lieutenant, on board, who having been on &s;hore in the opening, had ventured off, not|with&s;tanding the great &s;ea and bad weather, to inform me that he had found a fine harbour: we immediately &s;tood in for it, and found it equally beyond his report and our ex|pectations: the entrance is about a mile over, and every part of it is perfectly &s;afe, the depth of water, clo&s;e to the &s;hore, being from ten to &s;even fathom. We found this harbour to con&s;i&s;t of two little bays on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, where &s;hips may anchor in great &s;afety, and in each of which there is a fine rivulet of fre&s;h water. Soon after we entered an har|bour of much greater extent, which I called PORT EGMONT,
<PB N="48" REF="106">
in honour of the earl,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> who was then Fir&s;t Lord of the Ad|miralty; and I think it is one of the fine&s;t harbours in the world. The mouth of it is S. E. di&s;tant &s;even leagues from the low rocky i&s;land, which is a good mark to know it by: within the i&s;land, and at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the &s;hore, there is between &s;eventeen and eighteen fathom water; and about three leagues to the we&s;tward of the harbour, there is a remarkable white &s;andy beach, off which a &s;hip may anchor till there is an opportunity to run in. In &s;tanding in for this &s;andy beach, the two low rocky i&s;lands, which we found it difficult to clear when the weather obliged us to &s;tand off, appear to the ea&s;tward, and Port Egmont is about &s;ixteen leagues from the north end of the&s;e i&s;lands. We moored in ten fathom, with fine holding ground. The northermo&s;t point of the we&s;tern &s;hore was di&s;tant two miles and an half, the watering-place on that &s;hore bore W. N. W. &frac12; W. and was di&s;tant half a mile, and the i&s;lands on the ea&s;t &s;ide bore E. by S. and were di&s;tant four miles. The whole navy of England might ride here in perfect &s;ecurity from all winds. Soon after the &s;hip came to an anchor, the other boat which had remained on &s;hore when Mr. Hindman put off, came on board. In the &s;outh|ermo&s;t part of the harbour there are &s;everal i&s;lands, but there is no pa&s;&s;age out for a &s;hip; I went, however, through in my boat, about &s;even leagues di&s;tant from where the &s;hip lay, and entered a large &s;ound, which is too much expo&s;ed to a we&s;terly wind for &s;hips to lie in it &s;afely; and the Ma&s;ter of the Tamar, who had been round in her boat, and entered this &s;ound from without, reported that many &s;hoals lay off it, &s;o that if the harbour was ever &s;o good, it would not be prudent to attempt getting in. In every part of Port Egmont there is fre&s;h water in the greate&s;t plenty, and gee&s;e, ducks, &s;nipes, and other birds are &s;o numerous that
<PB N="49" REF="107">
our people grew tired of them: it was a common thing for a boat to bring off &s;ixty or &s;eventy fine gee&s;e, without ex|pending a &s;ingle charge of powder and &s;hot, for the men knocked down as many as they plea&s;ed with &s;tones: wood however, is wanting here, except a little that is found adrift along the &s;hore, which I imagined came from the Streight of Magellan. Among other refre&s;hments, which are in the highe&s;t degree &s;alutary to tho&s;e who have contracted &s;corbu|tic di&s;orders, during a long voyage, here are wild celery, and wood &s;orrel, in the greate&s;t abundance; nor is there any want of mu&s;&s;els, clams, cockles, and limpets: the &s;eals and penguins are innumerable, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to walk upon the beach without fir&s;t driving them away: and the coa&s;t abounds with &s;ea lions, many of which are of an enor|mous &s;ize. We found this animal very formidable; I was once attacked by one of them very unexpectedly, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that I could di&s;engage my&s;elf from him: at other times we had many battles with them, and it has &s;ometimes afforded a dozen of us an hour's work to di&s;|patch one of them; I had with me a very fine ma&s;tiff dog, and a bite of one of the&s;e creatures almo&s;t tore him to pieces. Nor were the&s;e the only dangerous animals that we found here, for the Ma&s;ter having been &s;ent out one day to &s;ound the coa&s;t upon the &s;outh &s;hore, reported, at his return, that four creatures of great fiercene&s;s, re&s;embling wolves, ran up to their bellies in the water to attack the people in his boat, and that as they happened to have no fire-arms with them, they had immediately put the boat off into deep water. The next morning after this happened, I went upon the &s;outhern &s;hore my&s;elf, where we found one of the large&s;t &s;ea lions I had ever &s;een: as the boat's crew were now well armed, they immediately engaged him, and during the conte&s;t one of the other animals was &s;een running towards us: he was
<PB N="50" REF="108">
fired at before he came up, and was pre&s;ently killed, though I afterwards wi&s;hed that we had endeavoured to take him alive, which, if we had been aware of his attack, I dare &s;ay might ea&s;ily have been done. When any of the&s;e creatures got fight of our people, though at ever &s;o great a di&s;tance, they ran directly at them; and no le&s;s than five of them were killed this day. They were always called wolves by the &s;hip's company, but except in their &s;ize, and the &s;hape of the tail, I think they bore a greater re&s;emblance to a fox. They are as big as a middle-&s;ized ma&s;tiff, and their fangs are remarkably long and &s;harp. There are great numbers of them upon this coa&s;t, though it is not perhaps ea&s;y to gue&s;s how they fir&s;t came hither, for the&s;e i&s;lands are at lea&s;t one hundred leagues di&s;tant from the main: they burrow in the ground like a fox, and we have frequently &s;een pieces of &s;eal which they have mangled, and the &s;kins of penguins, lie &s;cattered about the mouth of their holes. To get rid of the&s;e creatures, our people &s;et fire to the gra&s;s, &s;o that the country was in a blaze as far as the eye could reach, for &s;everal days, and we could &s;ee them running in great numbers to &s;eek other quarters. I dug holes in many places, about two feet deep, to examine the &s;oil, which I found fir&s;t a black mould, and then a light clay. While we lay here, we &s;et up the armourer's forge on &s;hore, and completed a great deal of iron work that was much wanted. Our people had every morning an excellent breakfa&s;t made of portable &s;oup, and wild celery, thickened with oatmeal: neither was our attention confined wholly to our&s;elves, for the Surgeon of the Tamar &s;urrounded a piece of ground near the water|ing-place with a fence of turf, and planted it with many e&s;culent vegetables as a garden, for the benefit of tho&s;e who might hereafter come to this place.

<P>In both the printed and manu&s;cript account, this land is &s;aid to lie in latitude forty-&s;even, to be &s;ituated to the we&s;t|ward of the &s;hip when fir&s;t di&s;covered, to appear woody, to have an harbour where a great number of &s;hips might ride in &s;afety, and to be frequented by innumerable birds.

appears al&s;o by both accounts, that the weather prevented his going on &s;hore, and that he &s;teered from it W. S. W. till he came into latitude fifty-three: there can therefore be little doubt but that Cowley gave the name of Pepys's I&s;land after he came home, to what he really &s;uppo&s;ed to be the i&s;land of Sebald de Wert, for which it is not difficult to a&s;&s;ign &s;eve|ral rea&s;ons; and though the &s;uppo&s;ition of a mi&s;take of the figures does not appear to be well grounded, yet, there being no land in forty-&s;even, the evidence that what Cowley &s;aw was Falkland's I&s;lands, is very &s;trong. The de&s;cription of the country agrees in almo&s;t every particular, and even the map is of the &s;ame general figure, with a &s;treight run|ning up the middle. The chart of Falkland's that accom|panies this narrative, was laid down from the journals and drawings of Captain Macbride, who was di&s;patched thither after my return, and circumnavigated the whole coa&s;t: the two principal i&s;lands were probably called Falkland's I&s;lands by Strong, about the year 1689, as he is known to have given the name of Falkland's Sound to part of the &s;treight which divides them. The journal of this navigator is &s;till unprinted in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;aeum. The fir&s;t who &s;aw the&s;e i&s;lands is &s;uppo&s;ed to be Captain Davies, the a&s;&s;ociate of Cavendi&s;h, in 1592. In 1594, Sir Richard Hawking &s;aw land, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame, and in honour of his mi&s;tre&s;s, Queen Elizabeth, called them HAWKINS's MAIDEN LAND. Long afterwards, they were &s;een by &s;ome French &s;hips from Saint Maloes, and Frezier, probably for that rea&s;on, called them the Malouins, a name which has been &s;ince adopted by the Spaniards.</P>
<P>Having continued in the harbour which I had called Port Egmont till Sunday the 27th of January,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 27" UNIT="day"> we &s;ailed again at eight o'clock in the morning with the wind at S. S. W.; but
<PB N="55" REF="113">
we were &s;carcely got out of the Port before it began to blow very hard,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> and the weather became &s;o thick that we could not &s;ee the rocky i&s;lands. I now mo&s;t heartily wi&s;hed my|&s;elf again at anchor in the harbour we had quitted; but in a &s;hort time we had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the weather be|come clear, though it continued to blow very hard the whole day. At nine the entrance of Port Egmont harbour bore E. S. E. di&s;tant two leagues; the two low i&s;lands to the north|ward E. by N. di&s;tant between three and four miles; and the Rocky i&s;land W. &frac12; N. di&s;tant four leagues. At ten the two low i&s;lands bore S. S. E. di&s;tant four or five miles; and we then &s;teered along the &s;hore ea&s;t by the compa&s;s, and after having run about five leagues, we &s;aw a remarkable head-land, with a rock at a little di&s;tance from it, bearing E. S. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant three leagues. This head-land I called CAPE TAMAR. Having continued the &s;ame cour&s;e five leagues farther, we &s;aw a rock about five miles from the main bear|ing N. E. at the di&s;tance of four or five leagues: this rock I called the EDISTONE, and then &s;teered between it and a re|markable head-land which I called CAPE DOLPHIN, in the direction of E. N. E. five leagues farther. From Cape Tamar to Cape Dolphin, a di&s;tance of about eight leagues, the land forms, what I thought, a deep &s;ound, and called CARLISLE SOUND, but what has &s;ince appeared to be the northern entrance of the Streight between the two principal i&s;lands. In the part that I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the bottom of the &s;ound, we &s;aw an opening, which had the appearance of a harbour. From Cape Dolphin we &s;teered along the &s;hore E. &frac12; N. &s;ixteen leagues, to a low flat cape or head-land, and then brought to. In this day's run the land, for the mo&s;t part, re&s;embled the ea&s;t &s;ide of the coa&s;t of Patagonia, not having &s;o much as a &s;ingle tree, or even a bu&s;h, being all downs, with here and there a few of the high tufts of gra&s;s that we had &s;een

<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 28" UNIT="day"> at four o'clock, we made &s;ail, the low flat cape then bearing S. E. by E. di&s;tant five leagues: at half an hour after five it bore S. S. E. di&s;tant two leagues; and we then &s;teered from it E. S. E. five leagues, to three low rocky i&s;lands which lie about two miles from the main. From the&s;e i&s;lands we &s;teered S. S. E. four leagues, to two other low i&s;lands, which lie at the di&s;tance of about one mile from the main. Between the&s;e i&s;lands the land forms a very deep &s;ound, which I called BERKELEY's SOUND. In the &s;outh part of this &s;ound there is an opening, which has the appearance of a harbour; and about three or four miles to the &s;outh|ward of the &s;outh point of it, at the di&s;tance of about four miles from the main, &s;ome rocks appear above the water, upon which the &s;ea breaks very high, there being here a great &s;well from the &s;outhward. When we were abrea&s;t of the&s;e breakers, we &s;teered S. W. by S. about two leagues, when the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight, which I took to be the &s;outhermo&s;t part of Falkland's I&s;lands, bore W. S. W. di&s;|tant five leagues. The coa&s;t now began to be very dange|rous, there being, in all directions, rocks and breakers at a great di&s;tance from the &s;hore. The country al&s;o inland had a more rude and de&s;olate appearance; the high ground, as far as we could &s;ee, being all barren, craggy rocks, very much re&s;embling that part of Terra del Fuego which lies near Cape Horn. As the &s;ea now ro&s;e every moment, I was afraid of being caught here upon a lee &s;hore, in which ca&s;e there would have been very little chance of my getting off,
<PB N="57" REF="115">
and therefore I tacked and &s;tood to the northward; <MILESTONE N="Monday 28" UNIT="day"> the lati|tude of the &s;outhermo&s;t point in &s;ight being about 52&deg; 3&prime; S.

It has been &s;aid by &s;ome former navigators to be about two hundred miles in circumference, but I made no doubt of its being nearer &s;even. Having hauled the wind, I &s;tood to the northward about noon; the entrance of Berkeley's Sound at three o'clock bore S. W. by W. di&s;tant about &s;ix leagues.

<P>WE continued to make &s;ail for Port De&s;ire till Wedne&s;|day the 6th of February,<MILESTONE N="February" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 6" UNIT="day"> when about one o'clock in the afternoon we &s;aw land, and &s;tood in for the Port. During the run from Falkland's I&s;lands to this place, the number of whales about the &s;hip was &s;o great as to render the naviga|tion dangerous; we were very near &s;triking upon one, and another blew the water in upon the quarter deck: they were much larger than any we had &s;een. As we were &s;tanding in for Port De&s;ire, we &s;aw the Florida, a &s;tore-&s;hip that we ex|pected from England; and at four we came to an anchor off the harbour's mouth.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> Mr. Dean, the Ma&s;ter of the &s;tore-&s;hip, came on board; and finding from his report that his fore|ma&s;t was &s;prung, and his &s;hip little better than a wreck, I determined to go into the harbour, and try to unload her there, although the narrowne&s;s of the place, and the rapi|dity of the tides, render it a very dangerous &s;ituation. We got in in the evening, but it blowing very hard in the night, both the Tamar and the &s;tore-&s;hip made &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s; I immediately &s;ent my boats to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who found that, notwith&s;tanding they were moored, they had been driven up the harbour, and were in the greate&s;t danger of

They were got off,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> not without great difficul|ty, and the very next night they drove again, and were again &s;aved by the &s;ame efforts, from the &s;ame danger. As I now found that the &s;tore-&s;hip was continually driving about the harbour, and every moment in danger of being lo&s;t, I gave up, with whatever reluctance, my de&s;ign of taking the provi&s;ions out of her, and &s;ent all our carpenters on board, to fi&s;h the ma&s;t, and make &s;uch other repairs as they could. I al&s;o lent her my forge to complete &s;uch iron work as they wanted, and determined, the moment &s;he was in a condition to put to &s;ea, to take her with us into the Streight of Magellan, and unload her there. While this was doing, Captain Mouat, who commanded the Tamar, informed me that his rudder was &s;prung, and that he had rea&s;on to fear it would in a &s;hort time become wholly un&s;erviceable. Upon this I or|dered the carpenter of the Dolphin on board the Tamar, to examine the rudder, and he reported it to be &s;o bad that in his opinion the ve&s;&s;el could not proceed in her voyage with|out a new one. A new one however it was not in our power to procure at this place, and I therefore de&s;ired Cap|tain Mouat to get his forge on &s;hore, and &s;ecure his rudder with iron clamps in the be&s;t manner he could, hoping that in the Streight a piece of timber might be found which would furni&s;h him with a better.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 13th, the &s;tore-&s;hip being ready for &s;ea,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 13" UNIT="day"> I put on board her one of my petty officers, who was well acquainted with the Streight, and three or four of my &s;ea|men to a&s;&s;i&s;t in navigating her; I al&s;o lent her two of my boats, and took tho&s;e belonging to her, which were &s;taved, on board to get them repaired, and then I ordered her Ma&s;ter, to put to &s;ea directly, and make the be&s;t of his way to Port Famine; though I did not doubt but that I

&s;hould come up with her long before &s;he got thither,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 13" UNIT="day"> as I intended to follow her as &s;oon as the Tamar was ready, and Captain Mouat had told me that, the rudder having been patched together by the joint labour and &s;kill of the carpen|ter and &s;mith, he &s;hould be in a condition to proceed with me the next morning.</P>
<P>The next morning we accordingly put to &s;ea,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 14" UNIT="day"> and a few hours afterwards being abrea&s;t of Penguin I&s;land, we &s;aw the &s;tore-&s;hip a long way to the ea&s;tward.</P>

<P>On the 17th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 17" UNIT="day"> at &s;ix in the morning, Cape Virgin Mary bearing &s;outh, di&s;tant five miles, we hauled in for the Streight, and the &s;trange &s;hip &s;till followed us.</P>
<P>On the 18th we pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Narrow,<MILESTONE N="Monday 18" UNIT="day"> and as I perceived the &s;trange &s;hip to have &s;haped the &s;ame cour&s;e that we had, from the time &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een us, &s;hortening or making &s;ail as we did, &s;he became the &s;ubject of much &s;peculation; and as I was obliged, after I had got through the fir&s;t Narrow, to bring to for the &s;tore-&s;hip, which was a great way a&s;tern, I imagined &s;he would &s;peak with us, and therefore I put the &s;hip in the be&s;t order I could. As &s;oon as he had pa&s;&s;ed the Narrow, and &s;aw me lying to, he did the &s;ame about four miles to windward of me. In this &s;ituation we remained till night came on, and the tide &s;etting us over to the &s;outh &s;hore, we came to an anchor; the wind however &s;hifted be|fore morning, and at day-break I &s;aw our &s;atellite at anchor about three leagues to leeward of us. As it was then tide of &s;tood, I thought of working through the &s;econd Narrow;
<PB N="61" REF="119">
but &s;eeing the &s;tranger get under way,<MILESTONE N="Monday 18" UNIT="day"> and work up towards us, I ran directly over into Gregory Bay, and brought the &s;hip to an anchor, with a &s;pring upon our cable: I al&s;o got eight of our guns, which were all we could get at, out of the hold, and brought them over on one &s;ide. In the mean time the &s;hip continued to work up towards us, and various were our conjectures about her, for &s;he &s;howed no colours, nei|ther did we. It happened about this time that the &s;tore-&s;hip, as &s;he was endeavouring to come to an anchor near us, ran aground; upon which the &s;tranger came to an anchor a little way a&s;tern, at the &s;ame time hoi&s;ting French colours, and &s;ending his launch, and another boat, with an anchor to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Still however I &s;howed no colours, but &s;ent my own boats, and a boat of the Tamar's, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;tore-&s;hip, giving orders at the &s;ame time to the officers, not to &s;uffer the French boats to come on board her, but to thank them in polite terms for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they intended. The&s;e or|ders were punctually obeyed, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our own boats only, the &s;tore-&s;hip was &s;oon after got off: my people reported that the French &s;hip was full of men, and &s;eemed to have a great number of officers on board.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, I made the &s;ignal and weighed; we worked through the &s;econd Narrow, and at ten o'clock pa&s;&s;ed the we&s;t end of it: at eleven, we anchored in &s;even fathom off Elizabeth's I&s;land; and the French &s;hip at the &s;ame time anchored in a bad &s;ituation, to the &s;outh|ward of Saint Bartholomew's I&s;land, which convinced me that &s;he was not acquainted with the channel.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> I weighed and &s;ailed be|tween Elizabeth and Bartholomew I&s;lands, with the wind at N. W. and after &s;teering S. S. W. five or &s;ix miles, we cro&s;&s;ed a bank, where among the weeds we had &s;even fathom

At noon this day, the north point of Fre&s;h Water Bay bore W. by N.; and Saint Anne's Point S. by E. &frac12; E. The French &s;hip &s;till &s;teered after us, and we imagined that &s;he was either from Falkland's I&s;lands, where the French had then a &s;ettlement, to get wood, or upon a &s;urvey of the Streight. The remaining part of this day, and the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 20" UNIT="day"> we had variable winds with calms; in the after|noon therefore I hoi&s;ted out the boats, and towed round Saint Anne's Point into Port Famine: at &s;ix in the evening we anchored, and &s;oon after the French &s;hip pa&s;&s;ed by us to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Here we continued till Monday the 25th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 25" UNIT="day"> when both the Dolphin and Tamar having taken out of the &s;tore-&s;hip as much provi&s;ion as they could &s;tow, I gave the Ma&s;ter of her, orders to return to England as &s;oon as he could get ready, and with the Tamar &s;ailed from Port Famine, intending to pu&s;h through the Streight before the &s;ea&s;on &s;hould be too far advanced. At noon, we were three leagues di&s;tant from Saint Anne's Point, which bore N. W. and three or four miles di&s;tant from Point Shutup, which bore S. S. W.

<P><PB N="63" REF="121">We &s;teered S. S.

She had hauled her &s;tern clo&s;e into the woods, and we could &s;ee large piles of the wood which &s;he had cut down, lying on each &s;ide of her; &s;o that I made no doubt of her having been &s;ent out to procure that nece&s;&s;ary for their new &s;ettlement, though I could not conceive why they &s;hould have come &s;o far into the Streight for that pur|po&s;e. After my return to England, I learnt that this ve&s;&s;el was the Eagle, commanded by M. Bougainville, and that her bu&s;ine&s;s in the Streight was, as I conjectured, to cut wood, for the French &s;ettlement in Falkland's I&s;lands. From Cape Shutup to Cape Forward the cour&s;e by compa&s;s is S. W. by S.; and the di&s;tance is &s;even leagues. At eight o'clock in the evening. Cape Forward bore N.

This part of the Streight is about eight miles over, and off the Cape we had forty fathom within half a cable's length of the &s;hore. About four o'clock in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 26" UNIT="day"> we made &s;ail; and at eight, having had light airs almo&s;t quite round the compa&s;s, Cape Forward bore N.

We kept however working to windward, and looking out for an anchoring-place, endea|vouring at the &s;ame time to reach a bay about two leagues to the we&s;tward of Cape Forward. At five o'clock I &s;ent a boat with an officer into this bay to &s;ound, who finding it fit for our purpo&s;e, we entered it, and about &s;ix o'clock an|chored in nine fathom: Cape Forward bore E. &frac12; S. di&s;tant

We found the flood here &s;et very &s;trong to the ea&s;tward; and according to our calculation, it flows at the full and change of the moon about twelve o'clock. We found the variation two points ea&s;terly.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the afternoon, of Thur&s;day the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 28" UNIT="day"> the wind being between the N. W. and W. with fre&s;h gales and &s;qualls, we made the &s;ignal to weigh, and ju&s;t as we had got the &s;hip over the anchor, a violent gu&s;t brought it home; the &s;hip immediately drove into &s;hoal water, within two cables' length of the &s;hore, upon which we let go the &s;mall bower in four fathom, and had but three fathom under our &s;tern: the &s;tream anchor was carried out with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, and by applying a purcha&s;e to the cap&s;tern, the &s;hip was drawn towards it: we then heaved up both the bower an|chors, &s;lipt the &s;tream cable, and with the gibb and &s;tay-&s;ails ran out into ten fathom, and anchored with the be&s;t bower exactly in the &s;ituation from which we had been driven.</P>
<P>At five o'clock the next morning, the wind being northerly,<MILESTONE N="Friday 1" UNIT="day"> and the weather moderate, we weighed again, and at &s;even pa&s;&s;ed Mu&s;cle bay, which lies on the &s;outhern &s;hore, about a league to the we&s;tward of Elizabeth's Bay. At eight, we were abrea&s;t of Bachelor's River, which is on the north &s;hore, about two leagues W. by N. from Elizabeth's Bay. At nine, we pa&s;&s;ed St. Jerom's Sound, the entrance of which is about a league from Bachelor's River: when St. Jerom's Sound
<PB N="66" REF="124">
was open,<MILESTONE N="Friday 1" UNIT="day"> it bore N. W. We then &s;teered W. S. W. by the compa&s;s for Cape Quod, which is three leagues di&s;tant from the &s;outhermo&s;t point of the Sound. Between Elizabeth Bay and Cape Quod, is a reach about four miles over, called Crooked Reach. At the entrance of Jerom's Sound, on the north &s;ide, we &s;aw three or four fires, and &s;oon afterwards, perceived two or three canoes paddling after us. At noon, Cape Quod bore W. S. W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant four or five miles, and &s;oon after, having light airs and calms, we drove to the ea&s;t|ward with the flood tide; in the mean time the canoes came up, and after having paddled about us &s;ome time, one of them had the re&s;olution to come on board. The canoe was of bark, very ill made, and the people on board, which were four men, two women, and a boy, were the poore&s;t wretches I had ever &s;een. They were all naked, except a &s;tinking &s;eal &s;kin that was thrown loo&s;ely over their &s;houlders; they were armed, however, with bows and arrows, which they readily gave me in return for a few beads, and other trifles. The arrows were made of a reed, and pointed with a green &s;tone: they were about two feet long, and the bows were three feet: the cord of the bow was the dried gut of &s;ome animal. In the evening, we anchored abrea&s;t of Bachelor's River, in fourteen fathom. The entrance of the River bore N. by E. di&s;tant one mile, and the northermo&s;t point of Saint Jerom's Sound W. N. W. di&s;tant three miles. About three quarters of a mile ea&s;tward of Bachelor's River, is a &s;hoal, upon which there is not more than &s;ix feet water when the tide is out: it is di&s;tant about half a mile from the &s;hore, and may be known by the weeds that are upon it. The tide flows here, at the full and change of the moon, about one o'clock. Soon after we were at anchor, &s;everal Indians came on board us, and I made them all pre&s;ents of beads, ribands, and other trifles, with which they appeared to be greatly

<P>At five o'clock, in the morning of the 2d, we weighed,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 2" UNIT="day"> and towed with the tide, but at ten, having no wind, and finding that we drove again to the ea&s;tward, we anchored, with the &s;tream anchor in fifteen fathom, upon a bank which lies about half a mile from the north &s;hore: after veering about two-thirds of a cable, we had five and forty fathom along-&s;ide, and &s;till deeper water at a little di&s;tance. The &s;outh point of Saint Jerom's Sound bore N. N. E. di&s;tant two miles, and Cape Quod W. S. W. di&s;tant about eight miles. From the &s;outh point of Saint Jerom's Sound, to Cape Quod, is three leagues, in the direction of S. W. by W. The tides in this Reach are exceedingly &s;trong, though very irregular: we found them &s;et to the ea&s;tward from nine o'clock in the morning till five o'clock the next morning, and the other four hours, from five to nine, they &s;et to the we&s;tward. At twelve o'clock at night, it began to blow very hard at W. N. W. and at two in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 3" UNIT="day"> the &s;hip drove off the bank: we immediately hove the anchor up, and found both the flukes broken off: till three o'clock we had no ground, and then we drove into &s;ixteen fathom, at the entrance of Saint Jerom's Sound; as it &s;till blew a &s;torm, we imme|diately let go the be&s;t bower, and veered to half a cable. The anchor brought the &s;hip up at &s;o critical a moment, that we had but five fathom, and even that depth was among breakers. We let go the &s;mall bower under foot, and at five, finding the tide &s;et to the we&s;tward, and the weather

more moderate,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 3" UNIT="day"> we got up both the anchors, and kept working to windward. At ten, we found the tide &s;etting again &s;trongly to the ea&s;tward, and we therefore &s;ent the boat back to &s;eek for an anchoring-place, which &s;he found in a bay on the north &s;hore, about four miles to the ea&s;tward of Cape Quod, and a little way within &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands: we endeavoured to get into this bay, but the tide ru&s;hed out of it with &s;uch violence, that we found it impo&s;&s;ible, and at noon, bore away for York Road, at the entrance of Bache|lor's River, where we anchored about an hour afterwards.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 4" UNIT="day"> we weighed, and worked with the tide, which &s;et the &s;ame as the day before, but we could not gain an anchoring-place, &s;o that at noon we bore away for York Road again. I took this opportunity to go up Bachelor's River in my jolly boat, as high as I could, which was about four miles: in &s;ome places I found it very wide and deep, and the water was good, but near the mouth it is &s;o &s;hallow at low water, that even a &s;mall boat cannot get into it.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock on the 5th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 5" UNIT="day"> we weighed again, and at eight, it being &s;tark calm, we &s;ent the boats a-head to tow; at eleven, however, the tide &s;et &s;o &s;trong from the we&s;tward, that we could not gain the bay on the north &s;hore, which the boat had found for us on the 4th, and which was an ex|cellent harbour, fit to receive five or &s;ix &s;ail: we were there|fore obliged to anchor upon a bank, in forty-five fathom, with the &s;tream anchor, Cape Quod bearing W. S. W. di&s;tant five or &s;ix miles, the &s;outh point of the i&s;land that lies to the ea&s;t of the Cape, being ju&s;t in one with the pitch of it, and a remarkable &s;tone patch on the north &s;hore bearing N. &frac12; W. di&s;tant half a mile. Clo&s;e to the &s;hore here, the depth of water was &s;eventy-five fathom. As &s;oon as we were at an|chor,

I &s;ent an officer to the we&s;tward to look out for a har|bour, but he did not &s;ucceed.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 5" UNIT="day"> It was calm the re&s;t of the day, and all night, the tide &s;etting to the ea&s;tward from the time we anchored till &s;ix o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 6" UNIT="day"> when we weighed, and were towed by the boats to the we&s;tward. At eight, a fre&s;h breeze &s;prung up at W. S. W. and W. and at noon, Cape Quod bore E. by S. at the di&s;tance of about five miles. In this &s;ituation I &s;ent the boats out again to look for an anchoring-place, and about noon, by their direction, we anchored in a little bay on the &s;outh &s;hore, oppo&s;ite to Cape Quod, in five and twenty fathom, with very good ground. A &s;mall rocky i&s;land bore W. by N. at the di&s;tance of about two cables' length, the ea&s;termo&s;t point E. &frac12; S. and Cape Quod N. E. by N. di&s;tant about three miles: in this place we had &s;hell-fi&s;h of various kinds in great plenty. The Tamar, not being able to work up to us, anchored about two o'clock in the bay on the north &s;hore, about &s;ix miles to the ea&s;tward of Cape Quod, which has been mentioned al|ready. During the night, it was &s;tark calm, but in the morning, having little airs of wind we&s;terly,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> I weighed about eight o'clock, and worked with the tide. At noon, Cape Quod bore E. by S. di&s;tant between two and three leagues, and Cape Monday, which is the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight on the &s;outh &s;hore, W. by N. di&s;tant about ten or eleven leagues. This part of the Streight lies W. N. W. &frac12; W. by the compa&s;s, and is but four miles over; &s;o that the craggy mountains which bound it on each &s;ide, towering above the clouds, and covered with everla&s;ting &s;now, give it the mo&s;t dreary and de&s;olate appearance that can be ima|gined. The tides here are not very &s;trong; the ebb &s;ets to the we&s;tward, but with an irregularity for which it is very difficult to account. About one o'clock, the Tamar anchored in the bay on the &s;outh &s;hore, oppo&s;ite to Cape Quod, which
<PB N="70" REF="128">
we had ju&s;t left,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> and we continued working to windward till &s;even in the evening, when we anchored in a &s;mall bay on the north &s;hore, about five leagues to the we&s;tward of Cape Quod, with very good ground. This bay may be known by two large rocks that appear above water, and a low point which makes the ea&s;t part of the bay. The an|choring-place is between the two rocks, the ea&s;termo&s;t bear|ing N. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant about two cables' length, and the we&s;termo&s;t, which is near the point, W. N.

If there are more &s;hips than one, they may anchor farther out in deeper water. During the night it was calm, and the weather became very foggy; <MILESTONE N="Friday 8" UNIT="day"> but about ten in the morning it cleared up, and I went on &s;hore. I found abundance of &s;hell-fi&s;h, but &s;aw no traces of people. In the afternoon, while the people were filling water, I went up a deep lagoon, which lies ju&s;t round the we&s;termo&s;t rock: at the head of it I found a very fine fall of water, and on the ea&s;t &s;ide &s;everal little coves, where &s;hips of the greate&s;t draught may lie in perfect &s;ecurity. We &s;aw nothing el&s;e worthy of notice, and therefore, having filled our boat with very large mu&s;cles, we returned.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 9" UNIT="day"> we weighed and towed out of the bay, and at eight, &s;aw the Tamar very far a&s;tern, &s;teering after us. At noon, we had little wind at E. N. E. but at five o'clock, it &s;hifted to W. N. W. and blew fre&s;h. At &s;ix, we were abrea&s;t of Cape Monday, and at &s;ix the next morn|ing,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 10" UNIT="day"> Cape Upright bore E. by S. di&s;tant three leagues. From Cape Monday to Cape Upright, which are both on the &s;outh &s;hore, and di&s;tant from each other about five leagues, the cour&s;e is W. by N. by the compa&s;s: the &s;hore on each &s;ide is rocky, with broken ground. At about half an hour after
<PB N="71" REF="129">
&s;even, we had a very hard &s;quall,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 10" UNIT="day"> and the weather being then exceedingly thick, we &s;uddenly perceived a reef of rocks clo&s;e under our lee bow, upon which the &s;ea broke very high: we had but ju&s;t time to tack clear of them, and if the &s;hip had mi&s;&s;ed &s;tays, every &s;oul on board mu&s;t in|evitably have peri&s;hed. The&s;e rocks lie at a great di&s;tance from the &s;outh &s;hore, and are about three leagues to the north of Cape Upright. At nine, the weather cleared a little, and we &s;aw the entrance of Long Reach, upon which we bore away, keeping neare&s;t the &s;outh &s;hore, in hopes of finding an anchoring-place. At ten, we had &s;trong gales and thick weather, with hard rain, and at noon, we were again abrea&s;t of Cape Monday, but could find no anchoring-place, which, however, we continued to &s;eek, &s;till &s;teering along the &s;outh &s;hore, and were &s;oon after joined by the Tamar, who had been &s;ix or &s;even leagues to the ea&s;tward of us all night. At &s;ix in the evening, we anchored in a deep bay, about three leagues to the ea&s;tward of Cape Monday: we let go the anchor in five and twenty fathom, near an i&s;land in the bottom of the bay; but before we could bring up the &s;hip, we were driven off, and the anchor took the ground in about fifty fathom. The extream points of the bay bore from N. W. to N. E. by E. and the i&s;land W. &frac12; S.: we veered to a whole cable, and the anchor was about a cable's length from the neare&s;t &s;hore. In the night, we had fre&s;h gales we&s;terly, with &s;udden &s;qualls and hard rain; but in the morning, the weather became more moderate,<MILESTONE N="Monday 11" UNIT="day"> though it was &s;till thick, and the rain continued. As a great &s;well &s;et into this place, and broke very high upon the rocks, near which we lay, I got up the anchor, and warped the &s;hip to a bank where the Tamar was riding: we let go our anchor in fourteen fathom, and moored with the &s;tream, anchor to the ea&s;tward, in forty-five fathom. In the bottom of this

<P>We continued here till Friday the 15th, and during all that time had one continued &s;torm, with impenetrable fogs, and ince&s;&s;ant rain.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 12" UNIT="day"> On the 12th, I &s;ent out the boat, with an officer, to look for harbours on the &s;outhern &s;hore: the boat was ab&s;ent till the 14th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 14" UNIT="day"> and then returned, with an account that there were five bays between the &s;hip's &s;tation and Cape Upright, where we might anchor in great &s;afety. The offi|cer told me, that near Cape Upright he had fallen in with a few Indians, who had given him a dog, and that one of the women had offered him a child which was &s;ucking at her brea&s;t. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that he refu&s;ed it, but the offer &s;eems to degrade the&s;e poor forlorn &s;avages more than any thing in their appearance or manner of life: it mu&s;t be a &s;trange depravity of nature that leaves them de&s;ti|tute of affection for their offspring, or a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation that impre&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ities upon them by which it is &s;urmounted. Some hills, which, when we fir&s;t came to this place, had no &s;now upon them, were now covered, and the winter of this dreary and inho&s;pitable region &s;eemed to have &s;et in at once: the poor &s;eamen not only &s;uffered much by the cold, but had &s;carcely ever a dry thread about them: I therefore di&s;tributed among the crews of both the &s;hips, not excepting the officers, two bales of a thick woollen &s;tuff, called Fearnought, which is provided by the government, &s;o that every body on board had now a warm jacket, which at this time was found both comfortable and &s;alutary.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 15th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 15" UNIT="day"> we weighed and made &s;ail, and at three o'clock in the afternoon, we were

<P>At &s;ix o'clock the next morning, we weighed,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 16" UNIT="day"> and found that the palm was gone from the &s;mall bower anchor. The wind was at W. N.

The Tamar being to windward of us, fetched into the bay, and anchored again. We continued to lo&s;e ground upon every tack, and therefore, at two o'clock, anchored upon the &s;outhern &s;hore in &s;ixteen fathom, about five miles to the ea&s;t|ward of Cape Monday. At three, however, I weighed again, for the boat having &s;ounded round the &s;hip, found the ground rocky. The wind was N.

and expected every moment to be among the breakers.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 27" UNIT="day"> The long wi&s;hed-for day at length broke, but the weather was &s;till &s;o thick that no land was to be &s;een, though we knew it could not be far di&s;tant, till after &s;ix, when we &s;aw the &s;outh &s;hore at about the di&s;tance of two miles; and &s;oon after, to our great &s;atisfaction, we &s;aw the Tamar: at this time Cape Monday bore S. E. di&s;tant about four miles, and the violence of the gale not abating, we bore away. About &s;even, both &s;hips came to an anchor in the bay which lies to the ea&s;tward of Cape Monday, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ea that rolled in; for we were glad to get anchorage any where. We had now been twice within four leagues of Tue&s;day's Bay, at the we&s;tern entrance of the Streight, and had been twice driven back ten or twelve leagues by &s;uch &s;torms as we had now ju&s;t experienced. When the &s;ea&s;on is &s;o far ad|vanced as it was when we attempted the pa&s;&s;age of this Streight, it is a mo&s;t difficult and dangerous undertaking, as it blows a hurricane ince&s;&s;antly night and day, and the rain is as violent and con&s;tant as the wind, with &s;uch fogs as often render it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any object at the di&s;|tance of twice the &s;hip's length. This day our be&s;t bower cable being quite rubbed to pieces, we cut it into junk, and bent a new one, which we rounded with old, rigging eight fathom from the anchor.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the day following,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 28" UNIT="day"> the Tamar parted a new be&s;t bower cable, it being cut by the rock, and drove over to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay, where &s;he was brought up at a very little di&s;tance from &s;ome rocks, again&s;t which &s;he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been da&s;hed to pieces.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock in the morning of the 29th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 29" UNIT="day"> we weighed and found our &s;mall bower cable very much rubbed by the foul ground, &s;o that we were obliged to cut no le&s;s than &s;ix
<PB N="78" REF="136">
and twenty fathom of it off,<MILESTONE N="Friday 29" UNIT="day"> and bend it again. In about half an hour, the Tamar, being very near the rocks, and not being able to purcha&s;e her anchor, made &s;ignals of di&s;|tre&s;s. I was therefore obliged to &s;tand into the bay again, and having anchored, I &s;ent haw&s;ers on board the Tamar, and heaved her up while &s;he purcha&s;ed her anchor, after which we heaved her to windward, and at noon, being got into a proper birth, &s;he anchored again. We continued in our &s;tation all night,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 30" UNIT="day"> and the next morning a gale came on at W. N. W. which was &s;till more violent than any that had preceded it; the water was torn up all round us, and carried much higher than the ma&s;ts heads, a dreadful &s;ea at the &s;ame time rolling in; &s;o that, knowing the ground to be foul, we were in con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of parting our cables, in which ca&s;e we mu&s;t have been almo&s;t in&s;tantly da&s;hed to atoms again&s;t the rocks that were ju&s;t to leeward of us, and upon which the &s;ea broke with inconceivable fury, and a noi&s;e not le&s;s loud than thunder. We lowered all the main and fore yards, let go the &s;mall bower, veered a cable and an half on the be&s;t bower, and having bent the &s;heet cable, &s;tood by the anchor all the re&s;t of the day, and till midnight, the &s;ea often breaking half-way up our main &s;hrouds. About one in the morning, the weather became &s;omewhat more moderate,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 31" UNIT="day"> but continued to be very dark, rainy, and tempe&s;|tuous, till midnight, when the wind &s;hifted to the S. W. and &s;oon afterwards it became comparatively calm and clear.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="April" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 1" UNIT="day"> which was the fir&s;t of April, we had a &s;tark calm, with now and then &s;ome light airs from the ea&s;tward; but the weather was again thick with hard rain, and we found a current &s;etting &s;trongly to the ea&s;tward. At four o'clock we got up the lower yards, unbent the &s;heet cable, and weighed the &s;mall bower; at eight we weighed
<PB N="79" REF="137">
the be&s;t bower,<MILESTONE N="Monday 1" UNIT="day"> and found the cable very much rubbed in &s;everal places, which we con&s;idered as a great misfortune, it being a fine new cable, which never had been wet before. At eleven, we hove &s;hort on the &s;tream anchor; but &s;oon after, it being calm, and a thick fog coming on with hard rain, we veered away the &s;tream cable, and with a warp to the Tamar, heaved the &s;hip upon the bank again, and let go the &s;mall bower in two and twenty fathom.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the evening, we had &s;trong gales at W. N. W. with violent &s;qualls and much rain, and continued in our &s;tation till the morning of the 3d,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 3" UNIT="day"> when I &s;ent the Tamar's boat, with an officer from each &s;hip, to the we&s;tward, in &s;earch of anchoring-places on the &s;outh &s;hore; and at the &s;ame time I &s;ent my own cutter with an officer to &s;eek an|choring-places on the north &s;hore.</P>
<P>The cutter returned the next morning at &s;ix o'clock,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 4" UNIT="day"> hav|ing been about five leagues to the we&s;tward upon the north &s;hore, and found two anchoring-places. The officer reported, that having been on &s;hore, he had fallen in with &s;ome In|dians, who had with them a canoe of a con&s;truction very different from any that they had &s;een in the Streight before; this ve&s;&s;el con&s;i&s;ted of planks &s;ewed together, but all the others were nothing more than the bark of large trees, tied together at the ends, and kept open by &s;hort pieces of wood, which were thru&s;t in tran&s;ver&s;ely between the two &s;ides, like the boats which children make of a bean &s;hell. The people, he &s;aid, were the neare&s;t to brutes in their manner and ap|pearance of any he had &s;een: they were, like &s;ome which we had met with before, quite naked, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather, except part of a &s;eal &s;kin which was thrown over their &s;houlders; and they eat their food, which was &s;uch as no other animal but a hog would touch,
<PB N="80" REF="138">
without any dre&s;&s;ing:<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 4" UNIT="day"> they had with them a large piece of whale blubber, which &s;tunk intolerably, and one of them tore it to pieces with his teeth, and gave it about to the re&s;t, who devoured it with the voracity of a wild bea&s;t. They did not however look upon what they &s;aw in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our people with indifference; for while one of them was a&s;leep, they cut off the hinder part of his jacket with a &s;harp flint which they u&s;e as a knife.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, we made &s;ail, and found little or no current. At noon, Cape Upright bore W. S. W. di&s;tant three leagues; and at &s;ix in the evening, we anchored in the bay, on the &s;outhern &s;hore, which lies about a league to the ea&s;t|ward of the Cape, and had fifteen fathom water.</P>
<P>While we were lying here, and taking in wood and water, &s;even or eight Indians in a canoe came round the we&s;tern point of the bay, and having landed oppo&s;ite to the &s;hip, made a fire. We invited them to me on board by all the &s;igns we could devi&s;e, but without &s;ucce&s;s; I therefore took the jolly boat, and went on &s;hore to them. I introduced my&s;elf by making them pre&s;ents of &s;everal trifles, with which they &s;eemed to be much gratified, and we became very intimate in a few minutes: after we had &s;pent &s;ome time together, I &s;ent away my people, in the boat, for &s;ome bread, and remained on &s;hore with them alone. When the boat returned with the bread, I divided it among them, and I remarked with equal plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e, that if a bit of the bi&s;cuit happened to fall, not one of them offered to touch it till I gave my con&s;ent. In the mean time &s;ome of my people were cutting a little gra&s;s for two or three &s;heep which I had &s;till left on board, and at length the Indians perceiving what they were doing, ran immediately, and tearing up all the weeds they could get, carried them to the
<PB N="81" REF="139">
boat,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 4" UNIT="day"> which in a very &s;hort time was filled almo&s;t up to her gunwale. I was much gratified by this token of their good|will, and I could perceive that they were plea&s;ed with the plea&s;ure that I expre&s;&s;ed upon the occa&s;ion; they had indeed taken &s;uch a fancy to us, that when I returned on board the boar, they all got into their canoe, and followed me. When we came near the &s;hip, however, they &s;topped, and gazed at her as if held in &s;urpri&s;e by a mixture of a&s;toni&s;hment and terror; but at la&s;t, though not without &s;ome difficulty, I pre|vailed upon four or five of them to venture on board. As &s;oon as they entered the &s;hip I made them &s;everal pre&s;ents, and in a very little time they appeared to be perfectly at ea&s;e. As I was very de&s;irous to entertain them, one of the mid&s;hipmen played upon the violin, and &s;ome of my people danced; at this they were &s;o much delighted, and &s;o impa|tient to &s;how their gratitude, that one of them went over the &s;hip's &s;ide into the canoe, and fetched up a &s;eal &s;kin bag of red paint, and immediately &s;meared the fiddler's face all over with it: he was very de&s;irous to pay me the &s;ame com|pliment, which however I thought fit to decline; but he made many very vigorous efforts to get the better of my mo|de&s;ty, and it was not without &s;ome difficulty that I defended my&s;elf from receiving the honour he de&s;igned me in my own de&s;pight. After having diverted and entertained them &s;eve|ral hours, I intimated that it would be proper for them to go on &s;hore; but their attachment was &s;uch, that it was by no means an ea&s;y matter to get them out of the &s;hip. Their canoe was not of bark, but of planks &s;ewed together.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 7th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 7" UNIT="day"> at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we weighed, with a moderate breeze at E. N. E. and fine wea|ther. At &s;even, we were abrea&s;t of Cape Upright; and at noon, it bore E. S. E. di&s;tant four leagues: &s;oon after we tried
<PB N="82" REF="140">
the current,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 7" UNIT="day"> and found it &s;et to the ea&s;tward at the rate of a knot and an half an hour. At three it fell calm, and the current driving us to the ea&s;tward very fa&s;t, we dropped an anchor, which before it took the ground was in one hun|dred and twenty fathom.</P>
<P>This day, and not before, the Tamar's boat returned from the we&s;tward: &s;he had been within two or three leagues of Cape Pillar, and had found &s;everal very good anchoring-places on the &s;outh more.</P>
<P>At one o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 8" UNIT="day"> having a fre&s;h gale at we&s;t, we weighed, notwith&s;tanding the weather was thick, and made &s;ail; at eleven it blew very hard, with violent rain and a great &s;ea, and as we perceived that we rather lo&s;t than gained ground, we &s;tood in for a bay on the &s;outh &s;hore, about four leagues to the we&s;tward of Cape Upright, and anchored in twenty fathom: the ground was not good, but in other re&s;pects this was one of the be&s;t harbours that we had met with in the Streight, for it was impo&s;&s;ible that any wind &s;hould hurt us. There being le&s;s wind in the after|noon, and it inclining a little towards the &s;outh, we un|moored at two, and at four, the wind having then come round to the S. S. E. and being a moderate breeze, we weighed and &s;teered to the we&s;tward: we made about two leagues and an half, but night then coming on, we an|chored, not without great difficulty, in a very good bay on the &s;outh &s;hore in twenty fathom. As very violent gu&s;ts came from the land, we were very near being driven off be|fore we could let go an anchor, and if we had not at la&s;t &s;ucceeded we mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed a dreadful night in the Streight; for it blew a hurricane from the time we came to an anchor till the morning, with violent rain, which was &s;ometimes intermingled with &s;now.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="141">At &s;ix o'clock,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 9" UNIT="day"> the wind being &s;till fre&s;h and &s;qually at S. S. E. we weighed and &s;teered W. by N. along the &s;outh &s;hore. At eleven, we were abrea&s;t of Cape Pillar, which by compa&s;s is about fourteen leagues W. &frac12; N. from Cape Up|right. Cape Pillar may be known by a large gap upon the top, and when it bears W.S.W. an i&s;land appears off it which has an appearance &s;omewhat like a hay-&s;tack, and about which lie &s;everal rocks. The Streight to the ea&s;tward of the Cape is between &s;even and eight leagues over; the land on each &s;ide is of a moderate height, but it is lowe&s;t on the north &s;hore, the &s;outh &s;hore being much the bolde&s;t, though both are craggy and broken. We&s;tmin&s;ter I&s;land is nearer to the north than the &s;outh &s;hore; and, by the compa&s;s, lies N. E. from Cape Pillar. The land on the north &s;hore, near the we&s;t end of the Streight, makes in many i&s;lands and rocks, upon which the &s;ea breaks in a tremendous manner. The land about Cape Victory is di&s;tant from Cape Pillar about ten or eleven leagues, in the direction of N. W. by N. From the Cape we&s;tward, the coa&s;t trends S. S. W. &frac12; W. to Cape De&s;eada, a low point, off which lie innumerable rocks and breakers. About four leagues W. S. W. from Cape De&s;eada lie &s;ome dangerous rocks, called by Sir John Nar|borough the Judges, upon which a mountainous &s;urf al|ways breaks with inconceivable fury. Four &s;mall i&s;lands, called the I&s;lands of Direction, are di&s;tant from Cape Pillar about eight leagues, in the direction of N. W. by W. When we were off this Cape it was &s;tark calm; but I never &s;aw &s;uch a &s;well as rolled in here, nor &s;uch a &s;urge as broke on each &s;hore. I expected every moment that the wind would &s;pring up from its u&s;ual quarter, and that the be&s;t which could happen to us would be to be driven many leagues up the &s;treight again. Contrary however to all expectation, a
<PB N="84" REF="142">
fine &s;teady gale &s;prung up at S. E. to which I &s;pread all the &s;ail that it was po&s;&s;ible for the &s;hip to bear,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 9" UNIT="day"> and ran off from this frightful and de&s;olate coa&s;t at the rate of nine miles an hour; &s;o that by eight o'clock in the evening we had left it twenty leagues behind us. And now to make the &s;hip as &s;tiff as po&s;&s;ible, I knocked down our after bulk-head, and got two of the boats under the half-deck, I al&s;o placed my twelve oared cutter under the boom; &s;o that we had no|thing upon the &s;kids but the jolly boat; and the alteration which this made in the ve&s;&s;el is inconceivable: for the weight of the boats upon the &s;kids made her crank, and in a great &s;ea they were al&s;o in danger of being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is probable, that whoever &s;hall read this account of the difficulties and dangers which attended our pa&s;&s;age through the Streight of Magellan, will conclude, that it ought never to be attempted again; but that all &s;hips which &s;hall here|after &s;ail a we&s;tern cour&s;e from Europe into the South Seas ought to go round Cape Horn. I, however, who have been twice round Cape Horn, am of a different opinion. I think that at a proper &s;ea&s;on of the year, not only a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el, but a large &s;quadron might pa&s;s the Streight in le&s;s than three weeks; and I think, to take the proper &s;ea&s;on, they &s;hould be at the ea&s;tern entrance &s;ome time in the month of December. One great advantage of this pa&s;&s;age, is the faci|lity with which fi&s;h is almo&s;t every where to be procured, with wild celery, &s;curvy-gra&s;s, berries, and many other vegetables in great abundance; for to this I impute the heathine&s;s of my &s;hip's company, not a &s;ingle man being affected with the &s;curvy in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, nor upon the &s;ick li&s;t for any other di&s;order, notwith&s;tanding the hard&s;hip and labour which they endured in the pa&s;&s;age, which co&s;t us &s;even weeks and two days, as we entered
<PB N="85" REF="143">
the Streight on Sunday the 17th of February,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 9" UNIT="day"> and quitted it on Tue&s;day the 9th of April. Wood and water are al&s;o to be procured almo&s;t at every anchoring-place beyond Fre&s;h Water Bay. Our &s;ufferings I impute wholly to our pa&s;&s;ing the Streight ju&s;t as the &s;un approached the equinox, when, in this high latitude, the wor&s;t weather was to be expected; and indeed the weather we had was dreadful beyond all de&s;cription.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> The Run from the We&s;tern Entrance of the Streight of Magellan, to the I&s;lands of Di&s;appointment.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING cleared the Streight, we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e to the we&s;tward, as appears by the track in the chart, till Friday, April the 26th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> when we di&s;covered the i&s;land of Ma&s;afuero bearing W. N. W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant about &s;ixteen leagues; but as to the northward it was hazey, the i&s;land of Don Juan Fernandes was not in &s;ight. During this run, the variation had gradually decrea&s;ed from 22&deg; to 9&deg; 36&prime; E.</P>
<P>We bore away for Ma&s;afuero, and at &s;un-&s;et, being within about &s;even leagues of it, we brought to, and afterwards kept the wind all night.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> At day-break the next day, we bore away again for the i&s;land, at the &s;ame time &s;ending an officer, with a boat from each &s;hip, to &s;ound the ea&s;tern &s;ide of it. About noon, the middle of the i&s;land bore W. di&s;tant about three miles, and as I &s;aw the boats run along the &s;hore, without being able to land any where for the &s;urf, I bore down to the north part of the i&s;land, off which a reef runs for the di&s;tance of about two miles, and lay by for them. This i&s;land is very high, and the greater part of it is covered with wood; but towards the north end, where I lay, &s;ome &s;pots &s;eemed to have been cleared, upon which great numbers of goats were feeding, and they had a green and plea&s;ant appearance. When the boats returned, the officer informed me that he had found a bank, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land neare&s;t to the &s;outh point, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore, where we might anchor, and op|po&s;ite
<PB N="87" REF="145">
to which there was a fine fall of fre&s;h water; <MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> but near the north point, he &s;aid, he could find no anchorage. The boats brought off a great quantity of very fine fi&s;h, which they had caught with hook and line near the &s;hore; and as &s;oon as we had taken them on board, which was late in the afternoon, we made &s;ail, and worked to windward in the night.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 28" UNIT="day"> we anchored with the &s;mall bower, on the bank which the boats had di&s;covered, in twenty-four fathom, with black &s;andy ground. The ex|tream points bore from S. to N. W. and the fall of water bore S. S. W. di&s;tant about a mile from the &s;hip's &s;tation. This part of the i&s;land lies north and &s;outh, and is about four miles long: the &s;oundings are very regular, from twenty to fifteen fathom, within two cables' length of the &s;hore. Soon after we were come to an anchor, I &s;ent out the boats to en|deavour to get &s;ome wood and water, but as I ob&s;erved the &s;hore to be rocky, and a &s;urf to break with great violence upon it, I ordered all the men to put on cork jackets, which had been &s;ent with us to be made u&s;e of upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. By the help of the&s;e jackets, which not only a&s;&s;i&s;ted the men in &s;wimming, but prevented their being brui&s;ed again&s;t the rocks, we got off a con&s;iderable quantity of water and wood, which, without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we could not have done: there was, however, another &s;pecies of danger here, again&s;t which cork jackets afforded no defence, for the &s;ea abounded with &s;harks of an enormous &s;ize, which, when they &s;aw a man in the water, would dart into the very &s;urf to &s;eize him: our people, however, happily e&s;caped them, though they were many times very near: one of them, which was upwards of twenty feet long, came clo&s;e to one of the boats that was watering, and having &s;eized a large &s;eal, in&s;tantly devoured it at one mouthful; and I my&s;elf &s;aw another
<PB N="88" REF="146">
of nearly the &s;ame &s;ize,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 28" UNIT="day"> do the &s;ame thing under the &s;hip's &s;tern. Our people killed and &s;ent off &s;everal of the goats, which we thought as good as the be&s;t veni&s;on in England; and I ob&s;erved, that one of them appeared to have been caught and marked, its right ear being &s;lit in a manner that could not have happened by accident. We had al&s;o fi&s;h in &s;uch plenty, that one boat would, with hooks and lines, catch, in a few hours, as much as would &s;erve a large &s;hip's company two days: they were of various &s;orts, all excellent in their kind, and many of them weighed from twenty to thirty pounds.</P>
<P>This evening, the &s;urf running very high, the gunner and one of the &s;eamen who were on &s;hore with the water|ers, were afraid to venture off, and the boat therefore, when &s;he came on board the la&s;t time, left them behind her.</P>
<P>The next day we found a more convenient watering-place,<MILESTONE N="Monday 29" UNIT="day"> about a mile and a half to the northward of the &s;hip, and about the middle-way between the north and &s;outh points of the i&s;land, there being at this place le&s;s &s;urf than where the boats fir&s;t went on &s;hore. The tide here &s;et twelve hours to the northward, and twelve to the &s;outhward, which we found very convenient, for as the wind was &s;outherly, with a great &s;well, the boats could not otherwi&s;e have got on board with their water. We got off ten tons of water from the new watering-place this day, and in the afternoon, I &s;ent a boat to fetch off the gunner and &s;eaman, who had been left on &s;hore at the old watering-place the night before; but the &s;urf was &s;till &s;o great, that the &s;eaman, who could not &s;wim, was afraid to venture: he was therefore again left behind, and the gunner &s;tayed with him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was reported to me, I &s;ent another boat to inform them that as, by the appearances of the weather,
<PB N="89" REF="147">
there was rea&s;on to believe it would &s;oon blow hard,<MILESTONE N="Monday 29" UNIT="day"> I was afraid I might be driven off the bank in the night, the con|&s;equence of which would be that they mu&s;t be left behind upon the i&s;land. When the boat came to the &s;urf, the people on board delivered my me&s;&s;age, upon which the gunner &s;wam through the &s;urf, and got on board her; but the &s;eaman, though he had a cork jacket on, &s;aid he was &s;ure he &s;hould be drowned if he attempted to get off to the boat, and that, chu&s;ing rather to die a natural death, he was determined at all events to remain upon the i&s;land: he then took an affectionate leave of the people, wi&s;hing them all happine&s;s, and the people on board returned his good wi&s;hes. One of the mid&s;hipmen, however, ju&s;t as the boat was about to return, took the end of a rope in his hand, jumped into the &s;ea, and &s;wam through the &s;urf to the beach, where poor John &s;till continued ruminating upon his &s;ituation, in a dejected attitude, and with a mo&s;t di&s;con|&s;olate length of countenance. The mid&s;hipman began to expo&s;tulate with him upon the &s;trange re&s;olution he had taken, and in the mean time having made a running knot in his rope, he dexterou&s;ly contrived to throw it round his body, calling out to his companions in the boat, who had hold of the other end of it, to haul away; they in&s;tantly took the hint, and the poor &s;eceder was very &s;oon dragged through the &s;urf into the boat: he had, however, &s;wallowed &s;o great a quantity of water, that he was to all appearance dead, but being held up by the heels, he &s;oon recovered his &s;peech and motion, and was perfectly well the next day. In the evening, I removed Captain Mouat from the Tamar, and appointed him Captain of the Dolphin, under me; Mr. Cumming, my Fir&s;t Lieutenant, I appointed Captain of the Tamar, taking Mr. Carteret, her Fir&s;t Lieutenant, on board

<P>I &s;tood for the &s;mall i&s;land, which as we drew near it had a mo&s;t beautiful appearance; it was &s;urrounded by a beach of the fine&s;t white &s;and, and within, it was covered with tall trees, which extended their &s;hade to a great di&s;tance, and formed the mo&s;t delightful groves that can be imagined, without underwood. We judged this i&s;land to be about five miles in circumference, and from each end of it we &s;aw a &s;pit running out into the &s;ea, upon which the &s;urge broke with great fury; there was al&s;o a great &s;urf all round it.

that were at lea&s;t &s;ixteen feet long.<MILESTONE N="Friday 7" UNIT="day"> They pre&s;ently made &s;everal large fires, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;ignal; for we immediately perceived &s;everal fires upon the larger i&s;land that was to windward of us, by which we knew that al&s;o to be inhabited. I &s;ent the boat with an officer to look for an anchoring-place, who, to our great regret and di&s;ap|pointment, returned with an account that he had been all round the i&s;land, and that no bottom could be found within le&s;s than a cable's length of the &s;hore, which was &s;urrounded clo&s;e to the beach with a &s;teep coral rock. The &s;curvy by this time had made dreadful havock among us, many of my be&s;t men being now confined to their hammocks; the poor wretches who were able to crawl upon the deck, &s;tood gazing at this little paradi&s;e which Nature had forbidden them to enter, with &s;en&s;ations which cannot ea&s;ily be con|ceived; they &s;aw cocoa-nuts in great abundance, the milk of which is perhaps the mo&s;t powerful anti&s;corbutic in the world: they had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that there were limes, bananas, and other fruits which are generally found be|tween the tropics; and to increa&s;e their mortification they &s;aw the &s;hells of many turtle &s;cattered about the &s;hore. The&s;e refre&s;hments, indeed, for want of which they were langui&s;hing to death, were as effectually beyond their reach as if there had been half the circumference of the world between them; yet their being in &s;ight, was no in|con&s;iderable increa&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;s which they &s;uffered by the want of them.

The natives ran along the &s;hore abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, &s;houting and dancing; they al&s;o frequently brandi&s;hed their long &s;pears, and then threw them&s;elves backward, and lay a few minutes motionle&s;s, as if they had been dead: this we under&s;tood as a menace that they would kill us, if we ventured to go on &s;hore. As we were &s;ailing along the coa&s;t, we took notice that in one place the natives had fixed upright in the &s;and two &s;pears, to the top of which they had fa&s;tened &s;everal things that flut|tered in the air, and that &s;ome of them were every moment kneeling down before them, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, invoking the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome invi&s;ible Being to defend them again&s;t us. While I was thus circumnavigating the i&s;land with the &s;hip, I &s;ent the boats out again to &s;ound, and when they came near the &s;hore, the Indians &s;et up one of the mo&s;t hi|deous yells I had ever heard, pointing at the &s;ame time to their &s;pears, and poi&s;ing in their hands large &s;tones which they took up from the beach. Our men on the contrary made all the &s;igns of amity and good-will that they could devi&s;e, and at the &s;ame time threw them bread and many other things, none of which they vouch&s;afed &s;o much as to touch, but with great expedition hauled five or &s;ix large canoes, which we &s;aw lying upon the beach, up into the wood. When this was done, they waded into the water, and &s;eemed to watch for an opportunity of laying hold of the boat, that they might drag her on &s;hore: the people on board her, apprehending that this was their de&s;ign, and that if they got them on &s;hore they would certainly put them to death, were very impatient to be before-hand with them,

and would fain have fired upon them; <MILESTONE N="Friday 7" UNIT="day"> but the officer on board, having no permi&s;&s;ion from me to commit any ho&s;ti|lities, re&s;trained them. I &s;hould indeed have thought my|&s;elf at liberty to have obtained by force the refre&s;hments, for want of which our people were dying, if it had been po&s;&s;ible to have come to an anchor, &s;uppo&s;ing we could not have made the&s;e poor &s;avages our friends; but nothing could ju&s;tify the taking away their lives for a mere imagi|nary or intentional injury, without procuring the lea&s;t ad|vantage to our&s;elves. They were of a deep copper colour, exceedingly &s;tout and well limbed, and remarkably nimble and active, for I never &s;aw men run &s;o fa&s;t in my life. This i&s;land lies in latitude 14&deg; 5&prime; S., longitude 145&deg; 4&prime; W. from the meridian of London. As the boats reported a &s;econd time that there was no anchoring ground about this i&s;land, I determined to work up to the other, which was accord|ingly done all the re&s;t of the day and the following night.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning of the 8th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 8" UNIT="day"> we brought to on the we&s;t &s;ide of it, at the di&s;tance of about three quarters of a mile from the &s;hore, but we had no &s;oundings with one hundred and forty fathom of line. We now perceived &s;everal other low i&s;lands, or rather penin&s;ulas, mo&s;t of them being joined one to the other by a neck of land, very nar|row, and almo&s;t level with the &s;urface of the water, which breaks high over it. In approaching the&s;e i&s;lands the cocoa|nut trees are fir&s;t di&s;covered, as they are higher than any part of the &s;urface. I &s;ent a boat with an officer from each &s;hip to &s;ound the lee-&s;ide of the&s;e i&s;lands for an anchoring-place; and as &s;oon as they left the &s;hip, I &s;aw the Indians run down to the beach in great numbers, armed with long &s;pears and clubs: they kept abrea&s;t of the boats as they went &s;ounding along the &s;hore, and u&s;ed many threatening

W. at the di&s;tance of &s;ix or &s;even leagues; and at &s;even we brought to for the night. In the morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 10" UNIT="day"> being within three miles of the &s;hore, we di&s;covered it to be a long low i&s;land, with a white beach, of a plea&s;ant appearance, full of cocoa-nut and other trees, and &s;urrounded with a rock of red coral. We &s;tood along the north ea&s;t &s;ide of it, within half a mile of the &s;hore; and the &s;avages, as &s;oon as they &s;aw us, made great fires, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, to alarm the di&s;tant inhabitants of the i&s;land, and ran along the beach, abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, in great numbers, armed in the &s;ame manner as the natives of the I&s;lands of Di&s;appointment. Over the land on this &s;ide of the i&s;land we could &s;ee a large lake of &s;alt water, or la|goon, which appeared to be two or three leagues wide, and to reach within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. Into this lagoon we &s;aw a &s;mall inlet about a league from the &s;outh we&s;t point, off which we brought to. At this place the natives have built a little town, under the &s;hade of a fine grove of cocoa-nut trees. I immediately &s;ent off the boats, with an officer in each, to &s;ound; but they could find no anchorage, the &s;hore being every where as &s;teep as a wall, except at the very mouth of the inlet, which was
<PB N="98" REF="156">
&s;carcely a &s;hip's length wide,<MILESTONE N="Monday 10" UNIT="day"> and there they had thirteen fathom, with a bottom of coral rock. We &s;tood clo&s;e in with the &s;hips, and &s;aw hundreds of the &s;avages, ranged in very good order, and &s;tanding up to their wai&s;ts in water; they were all armed in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e that we had &s;een at the other i&s;lands, and one of them carried a piece of mat fa&s;tened to the top of a pole, which we ima|gined was an en&s;ign. They made a mo&s;t hideous and ince&s;|&s;ant noi&s;e, and in a &s;hort time many large canoes came down the lake to join them. Our boats were &s;till out, and the people on board them made all the &s;igns of friend&s;hip that they could invent, upon which &s;ome of the canoes came through the inlet and drew near them. We now began to hope that a friendly intercour&s;e might be e&s;tabli&s;hed; but we &s;oon di&s;covered that the Indians had no other de&s;ign than to haul the boats on &s;hore: many of them leaped off the rocks, and &s;wam to them; and one of them got into that which belonged to the Tamar, and in the twinkling of an eye &s;eized a &s;eaman's jacket, and jumping overboard with it, never once appeared above water till he was clo&s;e in &s;hore among his companions. Another of them got hold of a mid&s;hipman's hat, but not knowing how to take it off, he pulled it downward in&s;tead of lifting it up; &s;o that the owner had time to prevent its being taken away, otherwi&s;e it would probably have di&s;appeared as &s;uddenly as the jacket; our men bore all this with much patience, and the Indians &s;eemed to triumph in their impunity.</P>
<P>About noon, finding there was no anchorage here, I bore away and &s;teered along the &s;hore to the we&s;termo&s;t point of the i&s;land: the boats immediately followed us, and kept founding clo&s;e to the beach, but could get no ground.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="157">When we came to the we&s;termo&s;t point of this i&s;land,<MILESTONE N="Monday 10" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw another, bearing S. W. by W. about four leagues di&s;tant. We were at this time about a league beyond the inlet where we had left the natives, but they were not &s;atisfied with having got rid of us quietly; for I now perceived two large double canoes &s;ailing after the &s;hip, with about thirty men in each, all armed after the manner of their country. The boats were a good way to leeward of us, and the canoes, pa&s;&s;ing between the &s;hip and the &s;hore, &s;eemed very eagerly to give them chace. Upon this I made the &s;ignal for the boats to &s;peak with the canoes, and as &s;oon as they per|ceived it, they turned, and made towards the Indians, who &s;eeing this, were &s;eized with a &s;udden pannic, and imme|diately hauling down their &s;ails, paddled back again at a &s;urpri&s;ing rate. Our boats however came up with them; but notwith&s;tanding the dreadful &s;urf that broke upon the &s;hore, the canoes pu&s;hed through it, and the Indians immediately hauled them up upon the beach. Our boats followed them, and the Indians, dreading an inva&s;ion of their coa&s;t, prepared to defend it with clubs and &s;tones, upon which our men fired, and killed two or three of them: one of them received three balls which went quite through his body; yet he af|terwards took up a large &s;tone, and died in the action of throwing it again&s;t his enemy. This man fell clo&s;e to our boats, &s;o that the Indians who remained unhurt did not dare to attempt the carrying off his body, which gave us an opportunity to examine it; but they carried off the re&s;t of their dead, and made the be&s;t of their way back to their companions at the inlet. Our boats then returned, and brought off the two canoes which they had pur&s;ued. One of them was thirty-two feet long, and the other &s;omewhat le&s;s, but they were both of a very curious con&s;truction, and
<PB N="100" REF="158">
mu&s;t have co&s;t tho&s;e who made them infinite labour.<MILESTONE N="Monday 10" UNIT="day"> They con&s;i&s;ted of planks exceedingly well wrought, and in many places adorned with carving; the&s;e planks were &s;ewed to|gether, and over every &s;eam there was a &s;trip of tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, very artificially fa&s;tened, to keep out the weather: their bottoms were as &s;harp as a wedge, and they were very nar|row; and therefore two of them were joined laterally to|gether by a couple of &s;trong &s;pars, &s;o that there was a &s;pace of about &s;ix or eight feet between them: a ma&s;t was hoi&s;ted in each of them, and the &s;ail was &s;pread between the ma&s;ts: the &s;ail, which I pre&s;erved, and which is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, is made of matting, and is as neat a piece of work as ever I &s;aw: their paddles were very curious, and their cord|age was as good and as well laid as any in England, though it appeared to be made of the outer covering of the cocoa-nut. When the&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ail, &s;everal men fit upon the &s;pars which hold the canoes together.</P>
<P>As the &s;urf which broke very high upon the &s;hore ren|dered it impo&s;&s;ible to procure refre&s;hments for the &s;ick in this part of the i&s;land, I hauled the wind, and worked back to the inlet, being determined to try once more what could be done there.</P>
<P>I recovered that &s;tation in the afternoon, and immediately &s;ent the boats to &s;ound the inlet again, but they confirmed the account which had been made before, that it afforded no anchorage for a &s;hip. While the boats were ab&s;ent, I ob|&s;erved a great number of the natives upon the point near the &s;pot where we had left them in the morning, and they &s;eemed to be very bu&s;y in loading a great number of large canoes which lay clo&s;e to the beach.

<P>Ju&s;t before the evening clo&s;ed in, our boats landed, and got a few cocoa-nuts which they brought off, but &s;aw none of the inhabitants. In the night, during which we had rain and hard &s;qualls, I &s;tood off and on with the &s;hips, and at &s;even o'clock in the morning brought to off the inlet.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> I im|mediately &s;ent the boats on &s;hore in &s;earch of refre&s;hments, and made all the men who were not &s;o ill of the &s;curvy as to be laid up, go in them; I al&s;o went on &s;hore my&s;elf, and continued there the whole day. We &s;aw many hou&s;es or wigwams of the natives, but they were totally de&s;erted, except by the dogs, who kept an ince&s;&s;ant howling from the time we came on &s;hore till we returned to the &s;hip: they were low mean hovels, thatched with cocoa-nut branches; but they were mo&s;t delightfully &s;ituated in a fine grove of &s;tately trees, many of which were the cocoa-nut, and many &s;uch as we were utterly unacquainted with. The cocoa-nut trees &s;eem to furni&s;h them with almo&s;t all the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life; particularly food, &s;ails, cordage, timber, and ve&s;&s;els to hold water; &s;o that probably the&s;e people always fix their habitations where the trees abound. We ob&s;erved the &s;hore to be covered with coral, and the &s;hells of very large pearl oy&s;ters; &s;o that I make no doubt but that as pro|fitable a pearl fi&s;hery might be e&s;tabli&s;hed here as any in the world. We &s;aw but little of the people, except at a di&s;tance; we could however perceive that the women had a piece of cloth of &s;ome kind, probably fabricated of the &s;ame &s;tuff as their &s;ail, hanging from the wai&s;t as low as the knee; the men were naked.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="160">Our people,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> in rummaging &s;ome of the huts, found the carved head of a rudder, which had manife&s;tly belonged to a Dutch longboat, and was very old and worm-eaten. They found al&s;o a piece of hammered-iron, a piece of bra&s;s, and &s;ome &s;mall iron tools, which the ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent in|habitants of this place probably obtained from the Dutch &s;hip to which the longboat had belonged, all which I brought away with me. Whether the&s;e people found means to cut off the &s;hip, or whether &s;he was lo&s;t upon the i&s;land or after &s;he left it, cannot be known; but there is rea&s;on to believe that &s;he never returned to Europe, becau&s;e no ac|count of her voyage, or of any di&s;coveries that &s;he made, is extant. If the &s;hip &s;ailed from this place in &s;afety, it is not perhaps ea&s;y to account for her leaving the rudder of her longboat behind her; and if &s;he was cut off by the natives, there mu&s;t be much more con&s;iderable remains of her in the i&s;land, e&s;pecially of her iron-work, upon which all Indian na|tions, who have no metal, &s;et the highe&s;t value; we had no opportunities however to examine this matter farther. The hammered-iron, bra&s;s, and iron tools, I brought away with me; but we found a tool exactly in the form of a carpen|ter's adze, the blade of which was a pearl oy&s;ter-&s;hell; po&s;|&s;ibly this might have been made in imitation of an adze which had belonged to the carpenter of the Dutch &s;hip, for among the tools that I brought away there was one which &s;eemed to be the remains of &s;uch an implement, though it was worn away almo&s;t to nothing.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e to the hou&s;es of the&s;e people, we &s;aw buildings of another kind, which appeared to be burying-places, and from which we judged that they had great veneration for their dead. They were &s;ituated under lofty trees, that gave a thick &s;hade; the &s;ides and tops were of &s;tone; and in their

figure they &s;omewhat re&s;embled the &s;quare tombs,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> with a flat top, which are always to be found in our country church|yards. Near the&s;e buildings we found many neat boxes full of human bones, and upon the branches of the trees which &s;haded them, hung a great number of the heads and bones of turtle, and a variety of fi&s;h, inclo&s;ed in a kind of ba&s;ket|work of reeds: &s;ome of the fi&s;h we took down, and found that nothing remained but the &s;kin and the teeth; the bones and entrails &s;eemed to have been extracted, and the mu&s;cular fle&s;h dried away.</P>
<P>We &s;ent off &s;everal boat-loads of cocoa-nuts, and a great quantity of &s;curvy-gra&s;s, with which the i&s;land is covered; refre&s;hments which were of infinite &s;ervice to us, as by this time I believe there was not a man among us wholly un|touched by the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>The fre&s;h water here is very good, but it is &s;carce; the wells which &s;upply the natives are &s;o &s;mall, that when two or three cocoa-nut &s;hells have been filled from them, they are dry for a few minutes; but as they pre&s;ently fill again, if a little pains were taken to enlarge them, they would abundantly &s;upply any &s;hip with water.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no venomous creature here; but the flies were an intolerable torment, they covered us from head to foot, and filled not only the boat, but the &s;hips. We &s;aw great num|bers of parrots and parroquets, and &s;everal other birds which were altogether unknown to us; we &s;aw al&s;o a beautiful kind of dove, &s;o tame that &s;ome of them frequently came clo&s;e to us, and even followed us into the Indian huts.</P>
<P>All this day the natives kept them&s;elves clo&s;ely concealed, and did not even make a &s;moke upon any part of the i&s;lands as far as we could &s;ee; probably fearing that a &s;moke might
<PB N="104" REF="162">
di&s;cover the place of their retreat.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> In the evening, we all returned on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>This part of the i&s;land lies in latitude 14&deg; 29&prime; S., longitude 148&deg; 50&prime; W. and after I got on board, I hauled a little way farther from the &s;hore, intending to vi&s;it the other i&s;land in the morning, which had been &s;een to the we&s;tward of that before which the &s;hip lay, and which is di&s;tant about &s;ixty-nine leagues from the I&s;lands of Di&s;appointment, in the di|rection of W. &frac12; S.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 12" UNIT="day"> at &s;ix o'clock, I made &s;ail for the i&s;land which I intended to vi&s;it, and when I reached it, I &s;teered S. W. by W. clo&s;e along the north ea&s;t &s;ide of it, but could get no &s;oundings: this &s;ide is about &s;ix or &s;even leagues long, and the whole makes much the &s;ame appearance as the other, having a large &s;alt water lake in the middle of it. As &s;oon as the &s;hip came in &s;ight, the natives ran down to the beach in great numbers: they were armed in the &s;ame man|ner as tho&s;e that we had &s;een upon the other i&s;land, and kept abrea&s;t of the &s;hip for &s;everal leagues. As the heat of this climate is very great, they &s;eemed to &s;uffer much by run|ning &s;o far in the &s;un, for they &s;ometimes plunged into the &s;ea, and &s;ometimes fell flat upon the &s;and, that the &s;urf might break over them, after which they renewed the race with great vigour. Our boats were at this time &s;ounding along the &s;hore, as u&s;ual, but I had given &s;trict orders to the officers who commanded them never to mole&s;t the natives, except it &s;hould become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their own defence, but to try all po&s;&s;ible means to obtain their confi|dence and good-will: our people therefore went as near to the &s;hore as they dur&s;t for the &s;urf, and made &s;igns that they wanted water; the Indians readily under&s;tood them, and directed them to run down farther along the &s;hore,
<PB N="105" REF="163">
which they did,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 12" UNIT="day"> till they came abrea&s;t of &s;uch a clu&s;ter of hou&s;es as we had ju&s;t left upon the other i&s;land; to this place the Indians &s;till followed them, and were there joined by many others: the boats immediately hauled clo&s;e into the &s;urf, and we brought to, with the &s;hips, at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore, upon which a &s;tout old man, with a long white beard, that gave him a very venerable appearance, came down from the hou&s;es to the beach. He was attended by a young man, and appeared to have the authority of a Chief or King: the re&s;t of the Indians, at a &s;ignal which he made, retired to a little di&s;tance, and he then advanced quite to the water's edge; in one hand he held the green branch of a tree, and in the other he gra&s;ped his beard, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om; in this attitude he made a long oration, or rather &s;ong, for it had a mu&s;ical cadence which was by no means di&s;agreeable. We regretted infinitely that we could not under&s;tand what he &s;aid to us, and not le&s;s that he could not under&s;tand any thing which we &s;hould &s;ay to him; to &s;hew our good-will, however, we threw him &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents, while he was yet &s;peaking, but he would neither touch them him&s;elf, nor &s;uffer them to be touched by others till he had done: he then walked into the water, and threw our people the green branch, after which he took up the things which had been thrown from the boats. Every thing now having a friendly appearance, our people made &s;igns that they &s;hould lay down their arms, and mo&s;t of them having complied, one of the mid&s;hipmen, encouraged by this te&s;timony of confidence and friend&s;hip, leaped out of the boat with his clothes on, and &s;wam through the &s;urf to the &s;hore. The Indians immediately gathered round him, and began to examine his clothes with great curio&s;ity; they &s;eemed particularly to admire his wai&s;tcoat, and being willing to gratify his new friends, he took it off, and pre|&s;ented
<PB N="106" REF="164">
it to them; <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 12" UNIT="day"> this courte&s;y, however, produced a di&s;|agreeable effect, for he had no &s;ooner given away his wai&s;tcoat, than one of the Indians very ingeniou&s;ly untied his cravat, and the next moment &s;natched it from his neck, and ran away with it. Our adventurer, therefore, to pre|vent his being &s;tripped by piece-meal, made the be&s;t of his way back again to the boat: &s;till, however, we were upon good terms, and &s;everal of the Indians &s;wam off to our people, &s;ome of them bringing a cocoa-nut, and others a little fre&s;h water in a cocoa-nut &s;hell. But the principal object of our boats, was to obtain &s;ome pearls; and the men, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in explaining their meaning, had taken with them &s;ome of the pearl oy&s;ter &s;hells which they had found in great numbers upon the coa&s;t; but all their en|deavours were ineffectual, for they could not, even with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at all make them&s;elves under&s;tood. It is indeed probable that we &s;hould have &s;ucceeded better, if an intercour&s;e of any kind could have been e&s;tabli&s;hed between us, but it was our misfortune that no anchorage could be found for the &s;hips. As all Indians are fond of beads, it can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed that the pearls, which the oy&s;ters at this place contained, were overlooked by the natives, and it is more than probable that if we could have continued here a few weeks, we might have obtained &s;ome of great value in exchange for nails, hatchets, and bill-hooks, upon which the natives, with more rea&s;on, &s;et a much higher value. We ob&s;erved, that in the lake, or lagoon, there were two or three very large ve&s;&s;els, one of which had two ma&s;ts, and &s;ome cordage aloft to &s;upport them.</P>

At this time, I took the&s;e for part of the i&s;lands called Solo|mon's I&s;lands, and was in hopes that I &s;hould fall in with others of them, in &s;ome of which we might find an harbour.</P>

<P>After having &s;een the breakers &s;oon after it was light in the morning, I told my officers that I apprehended we &s;hould have frequent alarms in the night; at night, therefore, every body was upon the watch, which a very hard &s;quall of wind, with rain, rendered the more nece&s;&s;ary. About nine o'clock, having ju&s;t gone down into my cabbin, I heard a

<P>Nothing worthy of notice happened till Monday the 24th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 24" UNIT="day"> when, about ten o'clock in the morning, we di&s;covered an|other i&s;land, bearing S. S.

It had a plea&s;ant appearance, and a large lake in the middle, like King George's I&s;land: it is near thirty miles in circumference, a dreadful &s;ea breaks upon almo&s;t every part of the coa&s;t, and a great deal of foul ground lies about it. We &s;ailed quite round it, and when we were on the lee-&s;ide, &s;ent out boats to &s;ound, in hopes of finding anchorage: no &s;oundings, however, were to be got near the &s;hore, but I &s;ent the boats out a &s;econd time, with orders to land, if it were po&s;&s;ible, and procure &s;ome refre&s;hments for the &s;ick: they landed with great difficulty, and brought off about two hundred cocoa-nuts, which, to per&s;ons in our circum&s;tances, were an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure. The people who were on &s;hore, reported that there were no &s;igns of its having ever been inhabited, but that they found thou&s;ands of &s;ea fowl &s;itting upon their ne&s;ts, which were built in high trees: the&s;e birds were &s;o tame that they &s;uf|fered them&s;elves to be knocked down without leaving their ne&s;ts: the ground was covered with land crabs, but our people &s;aw no other animal.

that this i&s;land was the &s;ame that in the <HI>Neptune Fran|&ccedil;ois</HI> is called <HI>Maluita,</HI><MILESTONE N="Monday 24" UNIT="day"> and laid down about a degree to the ea&s;tward of the great i&s;land of Saint Elizabeth, which is the principal of the Solomon's I&s;lands; but being afterwards convinced of the contrary, I called it the DUKE of YORK's ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Duke of York's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of his late Royal Highne&s;s, and I am of opinion that we were the fir&s;t human beings who ever &s;aw it.

&s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of it,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 3" UNIT="day"> which we judged to be about four leagues in length, and &s;oon perceived not only that it was inhabited, but very populous; for pre&s;ently after the &s;hip came in &s;ight, we &s;aw at lea&s;t a thou&s;and of the natives a&s;&s;embled upon the beach, and in a very &s;hort time more than &s;ixty canoes, or rather proas, put off from the &s;hore, and made towards us. We lay by to receive them, and they were very &s;oon ranged in a circle round us. The&s;e ve&s;|&s;els were very neatly made, and &s;o clean that they appeared to be quite new: none of them had fewer than three per&s;ons on board, nor any of them more than &s;ix. After the&s;e Indians had gazed at us &s;ome time, one of them &s;uddenly jumped out of his proa, &s;wam to the &s;hip, and ran up the &s;ide like a cat: as &s;oon as he had &s;tepped over the gunwale, he &s;at down upon it, and bur&s;t into a violent fit of laughter, then &s;tarted up, and ran all over the &s;hip, attempting to &s;teal whatever he could lay his hands upon, but without &s;ucce&s;s, for being &s;tark naked, it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal his booty for a moment. Our &s;eamen put him on a jacket and trow&s;ers, which produced great merriment, for he had all the ge&s;tures of a monkey newly dre&s;&s;ed; we al&s;o gave him bread, which he eat with a voracious appetite, and after having played a thou&s;and antic tricks, he leaped over|board, jacket and trow&s;ers and all, and &s;wam back again to his proa; after this &s;everal others &s;wam to the &s;hip, ran up the &s;ide to the gun-room ports, and having crept in, &s;natched up whatever lay in their reach, and immediately leaped again into the &s;ea, and &s;wam away at a great rate, though &s;ome of them, having both hands full, held up their arms quite out of the water, to prevent their plunder from being &s;poiled. The&s;e people are tall, well proportioned, and clean-limbed: their &s;kin is a bright copper colour, their features are extremely good, and there is a mixture of intrepidity

Many of the people now began to fall down with fluxes, which the Surgeon imputed to the exce&s;&s;ive heat, and almo&s;t perpetual rains.</P>
<P>By the 21&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 21" UNIT="day"> all our cocoa-nuts being expended, our people began to fall down again with the &s;curvy. The effect of the&s;e nuts alone, in checking this di&s;ea&s;e, is a&s;toni&s;hing: many who&s;e limbs were become as black as ink, who could not move without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two men, and who, be&s;ides total debility, &s;uffered excruciating pain, were in a few days, by eating the&s;e nuts, although at &s;ea, &s;o far recovered as to do their duty, and could even go aloft as well as they did before the di&s;temper &s;eized them. For &s;everal days, about this time, we had only faint breezes, with &s;mooth water, &s;o that we made but little way, and as we were now not far from the Ladrone I&s;lands, where we hoped &s;ome re|fre&s;hments might be procured, we mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed for a fre&s;h gale, e&s;pecially as the heat was &s;till intolerable, the gla&s;s for a long time having never been lower than eighty-one, but often up to eighty-four; and I am of opinion that this is the hotte&s;t, the longe&s;t, and mo&s;t dangerous run that ever was made.</P>
<P>On the 18th, we were in latitude 13&deg; 9&prime; N., longitude 158&deg; 50&prime; E.,<MILESTONE N="Monday 22" UNIT="day"> and on the 22d, in latitude 14&deg; 25&prime; N., longitude 153&deg; 11&prime; E. during which time we had a northerly current.

<P>ON the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 28" UNIT="day"> <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 30" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw a great number of birds about the &s;hip, which continued till the 30th, when about two o'clock in the afternoon we &s;aw land, bearing W. &frac12; N. which proved to be the i&s;lands Saypan, Tinian, and Aigui|gan. At &s;un&s;et, the extremes of them bore from N. W. &frac12; N. we&s;tward to S. W.; and the three i&s;lands had the appearance of one. At &s;even, we hauled the wind, and &s;tood off and on all night; and at &s;ix the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 31" UNIT="day"> the extremes of the i&s;lands, which &s;till made in one, bore from N. W. by N. to S. W. by S. di&s;tant five leagues. The ea&s;t &s;ide of the&s;e i&s;lands lies N. E. by N. and S. W. by S. Saypan is the northermo&s;t; and from the north ea&s;t point of that i&s;land to the &s;outh we&s;t point of Aiguigan, the di&s;tance is about &s;eventeen leagues. The&s;e three i&s;lands are between two and three leagues di&s;tant from each other; Saypan is the large&s;t, and Aiguigan, which is high and round, the &s;malle&s;t. We &s;teered along the ea&s;t &s;ide of them, and at noon hauled round the &s;outh point of Tinian, between that i&s;land and Aiguigan, and anchored at the &s;outh we&s;t end of it, in &s;ixteen fathom water, with a bottom of hard &s;and and coral rock, oppo&s;ite to a white &s;andy bay, about a mile and a quarter from the &s;hore, and about three quarters of a mile from a reef of rocks that lies at a good di&s;tance from the &s;hore, in the very
<PB N="116" REF="174">
&s;pot where Lord An&s;on lay in the Centurion.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 31" UNIT="day"> The water at this place is &s;o very clear that the bottom is plainly to be &s;een at the depth of four and twenty fathom, which is no le&s;s than one hundred and forty-four feet.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hip was &s;ecured, I went on &s;hore, to &s;ix upon a place where tents might be erected for the &s;ick, which were now very numerous; not a &s;ingle man being wholly free from the &s;curvy, and many in the la&s;t &s;tage of it. We found &s;everal huts which had been left by the Spaniards and Indians the year before; for this year none of them had as yet been at the place, nor was it probable that they &s;hould come for &s;ome months, the &s;un being now almo&s;t vertical, and the rainy &s;ea&s;on &s;et in. After I had fixed upon a &s;pot for the tents, &s;ix or &s;even of us endeavoured to pu&s;h through the woods, that we might come at the beautiful lawns and meadows of which there is &s;o luxuriant a de|&s;cription in the Account of Lord An&s;on's Voyage, and if po&s;&s;ible kill &s;ome cattle. The trees &s;tood &s;o thick, and the place was &s;o overgrown with underwood, that we could not &s;ee three yards before us, we therefore were obliged to keep continually hallooing to each other, to prevent our being &s;eparately lo&s;t in this trackle&s;s wilderne&s;s. As the weather was intolerably hot, we had nothing on be&s;ides our &s;hoes, except our &s;hirts and trow&s;ers, and the&s;e were in a very &s;hort time torn all to rags by the bu&s;hes and brambles; at la&s;t, however, with incredible difficulty and labour, we got through; but, to our great &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;appointment, we found the country very different from the account we had read of it: the lawns were entirely overgrown with a &s;tub|born kind of reed or bru&s;h, in many places higher than our heads, and no where lower than our middles, which conti|nually entangled our legs, and cut us like whipcord; our
<PB N="117" REF="175">
&s;tockings perhaps might have &s;uffered &s;till more,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 31" UNIT="day"> but we wore none. During this march we were al&s;o covered with flies from head to foot, and whenever we offered to &s;peak we were &s;ure of having a mouthful, many of which never failed to get down our throats. After we had walked about three or four miles, we got &s;ight of a bull, which we killed, and a little before night got back to the beach, as wet as if we had been dipt in water, and &s;o fatigued that we were &s;carcely able to &s;tand. We immediately &s;ent out a party to fetch the bull, and found that during our excur&s;ion &s;ome tents had been got up, and the &s;ick brought on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The next day our people were employed in &s;etting up more tents, getting the water-ca&s;ks on &s;hore,<MILESTONE N="Augu&s;t" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 1" UNIT="day"> and clearing the well at which they were to be filled. This well I ima|gined to be the &s;ame that the Centurion watered at; but it was the wor&s;t that we had met with during the voyage, for the water was not only bracki&s;h, but full of worms. The Road al&s;o where the &s;hips lay was a dangerous &s;ituation at this &s;ea&s;on, for the bottom is hard &s;and and large coral rocks, and the anchor having no hold in the &s;and, is in per|petual danger of being cut to pieces by the coral; to pre|vent which as much as po&s;&s;ible, I rounded the cables, and buoyed them up with empty water ca&s;ks. Another precau|tion al&s;o was taught me by experience, for at fir&s;t I moored, but finding the cables much damaged, I re&s;olved to lie &s;ingle for the future, that by veering away or heaving in, as we &s;hould have more or le&s;s wind, we might always keep them from being &s;lack, and con&s;equently from rubbing, and this expedient &s;ucceeded to my wi&s;h. At the full and change of the moon, a prodigious &s;well tumbles in here, &s;o that I never &s;aw &s;hips at anchor roll &s;o much as ours did while we lay here; and it once drove in from the we&s;tward with &s;uch
<PB N="118" REF="176">
violence, and broke &s;o high upon the reef, that I was ob|liged to put to &s;ea for a week; for if our cable had parted in the night, and the wind had been upon the &s;hore, which &s;ometimes happens for two or three days together, the &s;hip mu&s;t inevitably have been lo&s;t upon the rocks.</P>
<P>As I was my&s;elf very ill with the &s;curvy, I ordered a tent to be pitched for me, and took up my re&s;idence on &s;hore; where we al&s;o erected the armourer's forge, and began to repair the iron-work of both the &s;hips. I &s;oon found that the i&s;land produced limes, four oranges, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a particular de&s;cription of the bread-fruit, vol. ii. p. 80.</NOTE>, guavas, and paupaus in great abundance; but we found no water-melons, &s;curvy-gra&s;s, or &s;orrel.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s that we had en|dured, and the various climates we had pa&s;&s;ed through, nei|ther of the &s;hips had yet lo&s;t a &s;ingle man &s;ince their &s;ailing from England; but while we lay here two died of fevers, a di&s;ea&s;e with which many were &s;eized, though we all recovered very fa&s;t from the &s;curvy. I am indeed of opinion that this is one of the mo&s;t unhealthy &s;pots in the world, at lea&s;t during the &s;ea&s;on in which we were here. The rains were violent, and almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant, and the heat was &s;o great as to threaten us with &s;uffocation. The thermometer, which was kept on board the &s;hip, generally &s;tood at eighty-&s;ix, which is but nine degrees le&s;s than the heat of the blood at the heart; and if it had been on &s;hore it would have ri&s;en much higher. I had been upon the coa&s;t of Guinea, in the We&s;t Indies, and upon the i&s;land of Saint Thomas, which is un|der the Line, but I had never felt any &s;uch heat as I felt here. Be&s;ides the inconvenience which we &s;uffered from the weather, we were ince&s;&s;antly tormented by the flies in the
<PB N="119" REF="177">
day, and by the mu&s;quitos in the night. The i&s;land al&s;o &s;warms with centipieds and &s;corpions, and a large black ant, &s;carcely inferior to either in the malignity of its bite. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, there were venomous in&s;ects without number, altogether unknown to us, by which many of us &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely, that we were afraid to lie down in our beds; nor were tho&s;e on board in a much better &s;ituation than tho&s;e on &s;hore, for great numbers of the&s;e creatures being carried into the &s;hip with the wood, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every birth, and left the poor &s;eamen no place of re&s;t either below or upon the deck.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were &s;ettled in our new habitations, I &s;ent out parties to di&s;cover the haunts of the cattle, &s;ome of which were found, but at a great di&s;tance from the tents, and the bea&s;ts were &s;o &s;hy that it was very difficult to get a &s;hot at them. Some of the parties which, when their haunts had been di&s;covered, were &s;ent out to kill them, were ab&s;ent three days and nights before they could &s;ucceed; and when a bullock had been dragged &s;even or eight miles through &s;uch woods and lawns as have ju&s;t been de&s;cribed, to the tents, it was generally full of fly-blows, and &s;tunk &s;o as to be unfit for u&s;e: nor was this the wor&s;t, for the fatigue of the men in bringing down the carca&s;s, and the intolerable heat they &s;uffered from the climate and the labour, fre|quently brought on fevers which laid them up. Poultry however we procured upon ea&s;ier terms: there was great plenty of birds, and they were ea&s;ily killed; but the fle&s;h of the be&s;t of them was very ill-ta&s;ted, and &s;uch was the heat of the climate that within an hour after they were killed it was as green as gra&s;s, and &s;warmed with maggots. Our principal re&s;ource for fre&s;h meat, was the wild hog, with which the i&s;land abounds. The&s;e creatures are very fierce,
<PB N="120" REF="178">
and &s;ome of them &s;o large that a carca&s;s frequently weighed two hundred pounds. We killed them without much diffi|culty, but a Black belonging to the Tamar contrived a me|thod to &s;nare them, &s;o that we took great numbers of them alive, which was an un&s;peakable advantage; for it not only en&s;ured our eating the fle&s;h while it was &s;weet, but enabled us to &s;end a good number of them on board as &s;ea-&s;tores.</P>
<P>In the mean time we were very de&s;irous of procuring &s;ome beef in an eatable &s;tate, with le&s;s ri&s;k and labour, and Mr. Gore, one of our Mates, at la&s;t, di&s;covered a plea&s;ant &s;pot upon the north we&s;t part of the i&s;land, where cattle were in great plenty, and whence they might be brought to the tents by &s;ea. To this place therefore I di&s;patched a party, with a tent for their accommodation, and &s;ent the boats every day to fetch what they &s;hould kill; &s;ometimes how|ever there broke &s;uch a &s;ea upon the rocks that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to approach them, and the Tamar's boat unhappily lo&s;t three of her be&s;t men by attempting it. We were now, upon the whole, pretty well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, e&s;pe|cially as we baked fre&s;h bread every day for the &s;ick; and the fatigue of our people being le&s;s, there were fewer ill with the fever: but &s;everal of them were &s;o much di&s;or|dered by eating of a very fine looking fi&s;h which we caught here, that their recovery was for a long time doubtful. The Author of the Account of Lord An&s;on's Voyage &s;ays, that the people on board the Centurion thought it prudent to ab&s;tain from fi&s;h, as the few which they caught at their fir&s;t arrival &s;urfeited tho&s;e who eat of them. But not attend|ing &s;ufficiently to this caution, and too ha&s;tily taking the word <HI>&s;urfeit</HI> in its literal and common acceptation, we ima|gined that tho&s;e who ta&s;ted the fi&s;h when Lord An&s;on fir&s;t came hither, were made &s;ick merely by eating too much;
<PB N="121" REF="179">
whereas, if that had been the ca&s;e, there would have been no rea&s;on for totally ab&s;taining afterwards, but only eating temperately. We however bought our knowlege by experi|ence, which we might have had cheaper; for though all our people who ta&s;ted this fi&s;h, eat &s;paringly, they were all &s;oon afterwards dangerou&s;ly ill.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the fruit that has been mentioned already, this i&s;land produces cotton and indigo in abundance, and would certainly be of great value if it was &s;ituated in the We&s;t In|dies. The Surgeon of the Tamar enclo&s;ed a large &s;pot of ground here, and made a very pretty garden; but we did not &s;tay long enough to derive any advantage from it.</P>
<P>While we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay here, I &s;ent the Tamar to examine the i&s;land of Saypan, which is much larger than Tinian, ri&s;es higher, and, in my opinion, has a much plea&s;anter appearance. She anchored to the leeward of it, at the di&s;tance of a mile from the &s;hore, and in about ten fathom water, with much the &s;ame kind of ground as we had in the road of Tinian. Her people landed upon a fine &s;andy beach which is &s;ix or &s;even miles long, and walked up into the woods, where they &s;aw many trees which were very fit for topma&s;ts. They &s;aw no fowls, nor any tracks of cattle; but of hogs and guani|coes there was plenty. They found no fre&s;h water near the beach, but &s;aw a large pond inland, which they did not ex|amine. They &s;aw large heaps of pearl oy&s;ter-&s;hells thrown up together, and other &s;igns of people having been there not long before: po&s;&s;ibly the Spaniards may go thither at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and carry on a pearl fi&s;hery. They al&s;o &s;aw many of tho&s;e &s;quare pyramidal pillars which are to be found at Tinian, and which are particularly de&s;cribed in the Account of Lord An&s;on's Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="180">On Monday the 30th of September,<MILESTONE N="September" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 30" UNIT="day"> having now been here nine weeks, and our &s;ick being pretty well recovered, I ordered the tents to be &s;truck, and with the forge and oven carried back to the &s;hip; I al&s;o laid in about two thou&s;and cocoa-nuts,<MILESTONE N="October" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 1" UNIT="day"> which I had experienced to be &s;o powerful a remedy for the &s;curvy, and the next day I weighed, hoping that be|fore we &s;hould get the length of the Ba&s;he I&s;lands, the N.

<P>On the 18th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 18" UNIT="day"> we had found the &s;hip eighteen miles to the northward of her account, and &s;aw &s;everal land birds about the &s;hip, which appeared to be very much tired: we caught one as it was re&s;ting upon the booms, and found it very re|markable. It was about as big as a goo&s;e, and all over as white as &s;now, except the legs and beak which were black; the beak was curved, and of &s;o great a length and thickne&s;s, that it is not ea&s;y to conceive how the mu&s;cles of the neck, which was about a foot long and as &s;mall as that of a crane, could &s;upport it. We kept it about four months upon bi&s;|cuit and water, but it then died, apparently for want of nouri&s;hment, being almo&s;t as light as a bladder. It was very different from every &s;pecies of the Toucan that is re|pre&s;ented by Edwards, and I believe has never been de|&s;cribed.
<PB N="124" REF="182">
The&s;e birds appeared to have been blown off &s;ome i&s;land to the northward of us,<MILESTONE N="Friday 18" UNIT="day"> that is not laid down in the charts.</P>

<P>The next day I landed to &s;ee what was to be got,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 6" UNIT="day"> and found the inhabitants, who are Malays, a &s;urly in&s;olent &s;et of people. As &s;oon as they &s;aw us approaching the &s;hore, they came down to the beach in great numbers, having a long knife in one hand, a &s;pear headed with iron in the other, and a cre&s;&s;it or dagger by their &s;ide. We went on &s;hore, however, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ho&s;tile appearances, and a treaty &s;oon commenced between us; but all we could procure, was about a dozen of fowls, and a goat and kid. We had offered them knives, hatchets, bill hooks, and other things of the &s;ame kind; but the&s;e they refu&s;ed with great contempt, and demanded rupees: as we had no rupees, we were at fir&s;t much at a lo&s;s how to pay for our purcha&s;e; but at la&s;t we bethought our&s;elves of &s;ome pocket handker|chiefs, and the&s;e they vouch&s;afed to accept, though they would take only the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are of a &s;mall &s;tature, but extremely well made, and of a dark copper colour. We &s;aw among them one old man who was dre&s;&s;ed &s;omewhat in the manner of the Per&s;ians; but all the re&s;t were naked, except a handker|chief, which they wore as a kind of turban upon their heads, and &s;ome pieces of cloth which were fa&s;tened with a &s;ilver plate or cla&s;p round their middles. We &s;aw none of their women, and probably &s;ome care was taken to keep them out of our fight. The habitations are very neatly
<PB N="126" REF="184">
built of &s;lit bamboo,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 6" UNIT="day"> and are rai&s;ed upon po&s;ts about eight feet from the ground. Their boats are al&s;o well made, and we &s;aw &s;ome of a large &s;ize, in which we &s;uppo&s;ed that they carried on a trade to Malacca.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is mountainous and woody, but we found it plea&s;ant when we were a&s;hore; it produces the cabbage and cocoa-nut tree in great plenty, but the natives did not chu&s;e to let us have any of the fruit. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome rice grounds, but what other vegetable productions Nature has favoured them with, we had no opportunity to learn, as we &s;taid here but two nights and one day. In the bay where the &s;hip rode there is excellent fi&s;hing, though the &s;urf runs very high: we hauled our &s;eine with great &s;ucce&s;s, but could ea&s;ily perceive that it gave umbrage to the inhabitants, who con&s;ider all the fi&s;h about the&s;e i&s;lands as their own. There are two fine rivers that run into this bay, and the water is excellent: it was indeed &s;o much better than what we had on board, that I filled as many ca&s;ks with it as loaded the boat twice. While we lay here, &s;ome of the natives brought down an animal which had the body of a hare, and the legs of a deer; one of our officers bought it, and we &s;hould have been glad to have kept it alive, but it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to procure for it &s;uch food as it would eat; it was therefore killed, and we found it very good food. All the while we lay here, we had the mo&s;t violent thunder, lightning and rain, that I had ever known; and finding that nothing more was to be procured, we &s;ailed again on Thur&s;day morning,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> with a fine breeze off the land. In the afternoon, we tried the current, and found it &s;et S. E. at the rate of a mile an hour. The variation here was 38&prime; W.

The ve&s;&s;el was of a very &s;ingular con&s;truction; her deck was of &s;lit bamboo, and &s;he was &s;teered, not by a rudder, but by two large pieces of timber, one upon each quarter.</P>

<P>THE next day, which by our account was the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 28" UNIT="day"> but by the account of the Dutch at this place, was the 29th, we having lo&s;t a day by having &s;teered we&s;tward a year, we anchored nearer to the town, and &s;aluted the water fort with eleven guns, which were returned. We found here above a hundred &s;ail great and &s;mall, and among others, a large Engli&s;h &s;hip belonging to Bombay, which &s;aluted us with thirteen guns.</P>
<P>There is always lying here a Dutch Commodore belonging to the Company, who, among his countrymen, is a per&s;on of very great con&s;equence. This gentleman thought fit to &s;end his boat on board of me, with only the cock&s;wain in her, who was a very dirty ragged fellow: as &s;oon as he was brought to me, he a&s;ked whence I came, whither I was bound, and many other que&s;tions, which I thought equally impertinent, at the &s;ame time pulling out a book, and pen and ink, that he might &s;et down the an&s;wers; but as I was impatient to &s;ave him this trouble, he was de&s;ired imme|diately to walk over the &s;hip's &s;ide, and put off his boat, with which he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to comply.</P>
<P>When we came to this place, we had not one man &s;ick in either of the &s;hips; but as I knew it to be more unhealthy than any other part of the Ea&s;t Indies, as the rainy &s;ea&s;on was at hand, and arrack was to be procured in great plenty, I determined to make my &s;tay here as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible. I went on &s;hore to wait upon the Dutch Governor, but was
<PB N="132" REF="190">
told that he was at his country hou&s;e, about four miles di&s;tant from the town. I met however with an officer, called a &s;hebander, who is a kind of ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, and he acquainted me, that if I cho&s;e to go to the Governor immediately, rather than wait for his coming to town, he would attend me; I accepted his offer, and we &s;et out to|gether in his chariot. The Governor received me with great politene&s;s, and told me, that I might either take a hou&s;e in any part of the city that I &s;hould like, or be provided with lodgings at the hotel. This hotel is a licen&s;ed lodging-hou&s;e, the only one in the place, and kept by a Frenchman, an artful fellow, who is put in by the Governor him&s;elf. It has indeed more the appearance of a palace than a hou&s;e of entertainment, being the mo&s;t magnificent building in Ba|tavia; nor would a &s;mall edifice an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, for as there is a penalty of five hundred dollars upon any per&s;on in the city who &s;hall &s;uffer a &s;tranger to &s;leep a &s;ingle night at his hou&s;e, the &s;trangers who make it their re&s;idence are never few: all the hou&s;es indeed have a &s;tately appearance on the out&s;ide, and are elegantly fitted up within, and we were told that the Chine&s;e, of whom there are great numbers at this place, were the architects. The city is large, and the &s;treets well laid out, but they have greatly the appearance of tho&s;e in the cities of Holland, for a canal runs through mo&s;t of them, with a row of trees planted on each &s;ide: this is con|venient for the merchants, who have every thing brought up to their own doors by water, but it probably contributes to the unhealthine&s;s of the place; the canal, indeed, as the city is built in a &s;wamp, might be nece&s;&s;ary as a drain, but the trees, though they have a plea&s;ant appearance, mu&s;t certainly prevent the noxious vapours that are perpetually ari&s;ing, from being di&s;per&s;ed, by ob&s;tructing the circulation of the air.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="191">The number of people here is incredible, and they are of almo&s;t every nation in the world, Dutch, Portugue&s;e, Chi|ne&s;e, Per&s;ians, Moors, Malays, Javane&s;e, and many others: the Chine&s;e, however, have a large town to them&s;elves, without the walls, and carry on a con&s;iderable trade, for they have annually ten or twelve large junks from China; and to the&s;e the opulence of the Dutch at Batavia is in a great mea&s;ure owing. The beef here is bad, and the mutton &s;carce, but the poultry and fi&s;h are excellent and in great plenty. Here are al&s;o the greate&s;t variety and abundance of the fine&s;t fruit in the world, but the mu&s;quitos, centipieds, &s;corpions, and other noxious vermin, which are innu|merable, prevent all enjoyment, and even re&s;t, as well by night as by day. The roads, for many miles about the city, are as good as any in England: they are very broad, and by the &s;ide of them runs a canal, &s;haded by tall trees, which is navigable for ve&s;&s;els of a very large &s;ize: on the other &s;ide of the canal are gardens, of a very plea&s;ant appearance, and country hou&s;es of the citizens, where they &s;pend as much of their time as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;ituation being le&s;s unwhole&s;ome than the city; and there are &s;o few of them who do not keep a carriage, that it is almo&s;t a di&s;grace to be &s;een on foot.</P>
<P>At this place I continued from the 28th of November to the 10th of December, when,<MILESTONE N="December" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 10" UNIT="day"> having procured what refre&s;h|ments I could for my people, and taken on board a &s;ufficient quantity of rice and arrack, to &s;erve for the re&s;t of the voyage, I weighed anchor and made &s;ail.

<P>On Wedne&s;day the 12th, at three o'clock in the afternoon,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 12" UNIT="day"> we were abrea&s;t of Cape Lagullas, from which the coa&s;t lies W. N.

The Dutch told me, that none of their &s;hips could have worked in in &s;uch a gale of wind, and that we &s;eemed to come in fa&s;ter than they were generally able to do when the wind was fair.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Friday 14" UNIT="day"> I waited upon the Governor, who had &s;ent his coach and &s;ix to the water-&s;ide for me. He is an old man, but is a favourite with all ranks of people: he received me with the greate&s;t politene&s;s, and not only offered me the Company's hou&s;e in the garden for my re&s;idence while I &s;hould continue at the Cape, but his coach whenever I &s;hould think fit to u&s;e it. As I was one day at dinner with him, and &s;ome other gentlemen, I took occa&s;ion to mention the &s;moke that I had &s;een upon one of the &s;andy beaches on a de&s;olate part of the coa&s;t, and the &s;urpri&s;e with which it had &s;truck me: they then told me that another &s;hip, &s;ome time before, had fallen in with that part of the coa&s;t, and had &s;een large &s;mokes as I had done, although the place was uninhabited, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be an i&s;land: to account for the &s;mokes, however, they told me al&s;o, that two Dutch Ea&s;t Indiamen had, about two years before, &s;ailed from Batavia for the Cape, and had never afterwards been heard of; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that one or both of them had been &s;hip|wrecked there, and that the &s;mokes which had been &s;een, were made by &s;ome of the unfortunate crew: they added, that they had more than once &s;ent out ve&s;&s;els to look for them, but that there broke &s;o dreadful a &s;ea upon the coa&s;t, they were obliged to return without attempting to go on
<PB N="137" REF="195">
&s;hore. When I heard this melancholy account, I could only regret that I had not known it before, for I would then cer|tainly have made every effort in my power to have found the&s;e unhappy wretches, and taken them from a place where now, in all probability, they mu&s;t mi&s;erably peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The Cape is certainly a mo&s;t excellent place for &s;hips to touch at; it is a healthy climate, a fine country, and abounds with refre&s;hments of every kind. The Company's garden is a delightful &s;pot, and at the end of it there is a paddock belonging to the Governor, in which are kept a great number of rare and curious animals, and among others, when I was there, were three fine o&s;triches, and four zebras of an uncommon &s;ize.

The Tamar &s;teered very well with it, but thinking that it might not be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure her in bad weather, or upon a lee &s;hore, Lordered Captain Cumming to run down to Antigua, that he might there heave the &s;hip down, and get the rudder new hung, with a fre&s;h &s;et of braces which he had with him for that purpo&s;e; for the braces with which the &s;hip went out, being of iron, were not expected to la&s;t as long as our's, the lower ones, with the &s;heathing, being of copper.</P>

<P>HAVING received my commi&s;&s;ion, which was dated the 19th of June 1766,<MILESTONE N="1766" UNIT="year"><MILESTONE N="June 19" UNIT="month"> I went on board the &s;ame day, hoi&s;ted the pendant, and began to enter &s;ea|men, but, according to my orders, took no boys either for my&s;elf or any of the officers.</P>
<P>The &s;hip was fitted for the &s;ea with all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition, during which the articles of war, and the act of parliament were read to the &s;hip's company:<MILESTONE N="Sat" UNIT="day"> <MILESTONE N="July 26" UNIT="month"> on the 26th of July we &s;ailed down the river, and on the 16th of Augu&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Sat" UNIT="day"> <MILESTONE N="Aug. 16" UNIT="month"> at eight o'clock in the morning, anchored in Plymouth Sound.</P>
<P>On the 19th I received my &s;ailing orders,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> with directions to take the Swallow &s;loop, and the Prince Frederick &s;tore-&s;hip under my command: and this day I took on board, among other things, three thou&s;and weight of portable &s;oup, and a bale of cork jackets. Every part of the &s;hip was filled with &s;tores and nece&s;&s;aries of various kinds, even to the &s;teerage and &s;tate-room, which were allotted to the &s;lops and portable &s;oup. The &s;urgeon offered to purcha&s;e an extraordinary quantity of medicines, and medical ne|ce&s;&s;aries, which, as the &s;hip's company might become &s;ickly,
<PB N="364" REF="200">
he &s;aid would in that ca&s;e be of great &s;ervice, if room could be found to flow them in; I therefore gave him leave to put them into my cabbin, the only place in the &s;hip where they could be received, as they con&s;i&s;ted of three large boxes.</P>
<P>On the 22d,<MILESTONE N="Friday 22" UNIT="day"> at four o'clock in the morning, I weighed and made &s;ail in company with the Swallow and Prince Frederick, and had &s;oon the mortification to find that the Swallow was a very bad &s;ailer.</P>
<P>We proceeded in our voyage, without any remarkable in|cident, till Sunday the &s;eventh of September,<MILESTONE N="September" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Sunday 7" UNIT="day"> when, about eight o'clock in the morning, we &s;aw the i&s;land of Porto Santo, bearing we&s;t; and about noon &s;aw the ea&s;t-end of the i&s;land of Madeira.</P>
<P>About five o'clock we ran between this end of the i&s;land and the De&s;erters. On the &s;ide next the De&s;erters is a low flat i&s;land, and near it a needle rock; the &s;ide next to Ma|deira is full of broken rocks, and for that rea&s;on it is not &s;afe to come within le&s;s than two miles of it.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the evening we anchored in Madeira Road, about two-thirds of a mile from the &s;hore, in 24 fathom with a muddy bottom: about eight the Swallow and Prince Frederick al&s;o came to an anchor; and I &s;ent an officer on &s;hore to the Governor, to let him know that I would &s;alute him, if he would return an equal number of guns, which he promi&s;ed to do; <MILESTONE N="Monday 8" UNIT="day"> the next morning therefore, at &s;ix o'clock, I &s;aluted him with thirteen guns, and he returned thirteen as he had promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having taken in a proper quantity of water at this place, with four pipes and ten puncheons of wine, &s;ome fre&s;h beef, and a large quantity of onions, we weighed anchor on the 12th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 12" UNIT="day"> and continued our voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="201">At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, of Tue&s;day the 16th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw the i&s;land of Palma, and found the &s;hip 15 miles to the &s;outhward of her reckoning. As we were &s;ailing along this i&s;land, at the rate of no le&s;s than eight miles an hour, with the wind at ea&s;t, it died away at once; &s;o that within le&s;s than two minutes the &s;hip had no motion, though we were at lea&s;t four leagues di&s;tant from the &s;hore. Palma lies in lat. 28&deg; 40&prime; N. long. 17&deg; 48&prime; W.</P>
<P>On the 20th we tried the current,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 20" UNIT="day"> and found it &s;et S. W. by W. one mile an hour: this day we &s;aw two herons flying to the ea&s;tward, and a great number of bonettos about the &s;hip, of which we caught eight.</P>
<P>In the night between the 21&s;t and 22d we lo&s;t our com|panion the Swallow,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 21" UNIT="day"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 22" UNIT="day"> and about eight in the morning we &s;aw the i&s;land of Sal, bearing S. &frac12; W.; at noon it bore S. &frac34; W. di&s;tant 8 leagues; and at noon on the 23d,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 23" UNIT="day"> the neare&s;t land of the i&s;land of Bonavi&s;ta bore from S. to W. S. W. di&s;tant &s;even or eight miles, the ea&s;t-end, at the &s;ame time, bearing W. di&s;tant two leagues. In this &s;ituation we &s;ounded, and had only 15 fathom, with rocky ground; at the &s;ame time we &s;aw a very great rippling, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be cau&s;ed by a reef, &s;tretching off the point about E. S. E. three miles, and breakers without us, di&s;tant al&s;o about three miles in the direction of S. E. We &s;teered between the rippling and the breakers, but after hauling the &s;hip off about half a mile, we had no &s;oundings. The Prince Fre|derick pa&s;&s;ed very near the breakers, in the S. E. but had no &s;oundings; yet the&s;e breakers are &s;uppo&s;ed to be dan|gerous. The middle of the i&s;le of Sal is in lat. 16&deg; 55&prime; N. long. 21&deg; 59&prime; W.; the middle of Bonavi&s;ta is in lat. 16&deg; 10&prime; long. 23&deg; W.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="202">On the next day,<MILESTONE N="Wedn. 24" UNIT="day"> at &s;ix in the morning, the i&s;le of May bore from W. to S. W. &s;ix leagues; and &s;oon after the Swallow again joined company. At half an hour after 10 the we&s;t-end of the i&s;le of May bore north at the di&s;tance of five miles, and we found a current here, &s;etting to the &s;outh|ward at the rate of twenty miles in four and twenty hours. The latitude of this i&s;land is 15&deg; 10&prime; N. longitude 22&deg; 25&prime; W.</P>
<P>At noon the &s;outh-end of the i&s;land St. Iago bore S. W. by W. di&s;tant four leagues; and the north-end N. W. di&s;tant five leagues. At half an hour after three we anchored in Port Praya, in that i&s;land, in company with the Swallow and Prince Frederick, in eight fathom water, upon &s;andy ground. We had much rain and lightning in the night, and early in the morning I &s;ent to the commanding-officer at the fort,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;. 25" UNIT="day"> for leave to get off &s;ome water, and other refre&s;hments, which he granted.</P>
<P>We &s;oon learnt that this was the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, and that the rains were &s;o great as to render it extremely difficult to get any thing down from the country to the &s;hips: it hap|pened al&s;o, unfortunately, that the &s;mall-pox, which is ex|tremely fatal here, was at this time epidemic; &s;o that I per|mitted no man to go a&s;hore who had not had that di&s;temper, and I would not &s;uffer even tho&s;e that had to go into any hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We procured, however, a &s;upply of water and &s;ome cattle from the &s;hore, and caught abundance of fi&s;h with the &s;eine, which was hauled twice every day: we found al&s;o in the valley where we got our water, a kind of large pur&s;lain, growing wild in amazing quantities: this was a mo&s;t wel|come refre&s;hment both raw as a &s;allad, and boiled with the
<PB N="367" REF="203">
broth and pea&s;e; and when we left the place we carried away enough of it to &s;erve us a week.</P>
<P>On the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 28" UNIT="day"> at half an hour after twelve we weighed and put to &s;ea; at half an hour after &s;ix in the evening the peak of Fuego bore W. N. W. di&s;tant 12 leagues, and in the night the burning mountain was very vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>This day I ordered hooks and lines to be &s;erved to all the &s;hip's company, that they might catch fi&s;h for them&s;elves; but at the &s;ame time I al&s;o ordered that no man &s;hould keep his fi&s;h more than four and twenty hours before it was eaten, for I had ob&s;erved that &s;tale, and even dried fi&s;h, had made the people &s;ickly, and tainted the air in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of October,<MILESTONE N="October" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 1" UNIT="day"> in lat. 10&deg; 37&prime; N. we lo&s;t the true trade-wind, and had only light and variable gales; and this day we found that the &s;hip was &s;et twelve miles to the north|ward by a current; <MILESTONE N="Friday 3" UNIT="day"> on the third we found a current run S. by E. at the rate of &s;ix fathom an hour, or about twenty miles and a half a day:<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> on the &s;eventh we found the &s;hip 19 miles to the &s;outhward of her reckoning.</P>
<P>On the 20th, our butter and chee&s;e being all expended,<MILESTONE N="Monday 20" UNIT="day"> we began to &s;erve the &s;hip's company with oil, and I gave orders that they &s;hould al&s;o be &s;erved with mu&s;tard and vinegar once a fortnight during the re&s;t of the voyage.</P>
<P>On the 22d we &s;aw an incredible number of birds,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 23" UNIT="day"> and among the re&s;t a man of war bird, which inclined us to think that &s;ome land was not more than 60 leagues di&s;tant: this day we cro&s;&s;ed the equator in longitude 23&deg; 40&prime; W.</P>
<P>On the 24th I ordered the &s;hip's company to be &s;erved with brandy, and re&s;erved the wine for the &s;ick and convale&s;cent.<MILESTONE N="Friday 24" UNIT="day"> On the 26th the Prince Frederick made &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 26" UNIT="day"> upon which we bore down to her, and found that &s;he had
<PB N="368" REF="204">
carried away her fore-top-&s;ail-yard. To &s;upply this lo&s;s we gave her our &s;prit-&s;ail-top-&s;ail-yard, which we could &s;pare, and &s;he hoi&s;ted it immediately.</P>
<P>On the 27th &s;he again made &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s,<MILESTONE N="Monday 27" UNIT="day"> upon which I brought to, and &s;ent the carpenter on board her, who re|turned with an account that &s;he had &s;prung a leak under the larboard cheek forward, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to do any thing to it till we had better weather. Upon &s;peaking with Lieutenant Brine, who commanded her, he informed me that his crew were &s;ickly; that the fatigue of working the pumps, and con&s;tantly &s;tanding by the &s;ails, had worn them down; that their provi&s;ions were not good, that they had nothing to drink but water, and that he feared it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to keep company with me except I could &s;pare him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For the badne&s;s of their provi&s;ion I had no remedy, but I &s;ent on board a carpenter and &s;ix &s;eamen to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pumping and working the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the eighth of November,<MILESTONE N="November" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Saturday 8" UNIT="day"> being in latitude 25&deg; 52&prime; S. longitude 39&deg; 38&prime; we &s;ounded with 160 fathom, but had no ground: on the ninth, having &s;een a great number of birds, called albatro&s;&s;es, we &s;ounded again with 180 fathom, but had no ground.</P>
<P>On the 11th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> having by &s;ignal brought the &s;tore-&s;hip under our &s;tern, I &s;ent the carpenter, with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tants, on board to &s;top the leak; but they found that very little could be done: we then compleated our provi&s;ions, and tho&s;e of the Swallow, from her &s;tores, and put on board her all our &s;taves, iron hoops, and empty oil jars. The next day I &s;ent a carpenter and &s;ix &s;eamen to relieve the men that had been &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t her on the 27th of October, who, by this time, began to &s;uffer much by their fatigue. Several of her crew having the appearance of the &s;curvy, I &s;ent
<PB N="369" REF="205">
the &s;urgeon on board her with &s;ome medicines for the &s;ick. This day, having &s;een &s;ome albatro&s;&s;es, turtles, and weeds, we &s;ounded, but had no ground with 180 fathom.</P>
<P>On the 12th, being now in latitude 30 &s;outh,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 12" UNIT="day"> we began to find it very cold; we therefore got up our quarter cloths, and fitted them to their proper places, and the &s;eamen put on their thick jackets. This day we &s;aw a turtle, and &s;everal albatro&s;&s;es, but &s;till had no ground with 180 fathom.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;ee weeds and birds on board the &s;hip, but had no ground till the 18th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 18" UNIT="day"> when we found a &s;oft muddy bottom at the depth of 54 fathom. We were now in lat. 35&deg; 40&prime; S. long. 49&deg; 54&prime; W.; and this was the fir&s;t &s;ound|ing we had after our coming upon the coa&s;t of Brazil.</P>
<P>On the 19th, about eight o'clock in the evening,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 19" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw a meteor of a very extraordinary appearance in the north|ea&s;t, which, &s;oon after we had ob&s;erved it, flew off in a ho|rizontal line to the &s;outh-we&s;t, with amazing rapidity: it was near a minute in its progre&s;s, and it left a train of light behind it &s;o &s;trong, that the deck was not le&s;s illuminated than at noon-day. This day we &s;aw a great number of &s;eals about the &s;hip, and had &s;oundings at 55 fathom, with a muddy bottom. The next day the &s;eals continued,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 20" UNIT="day"> and we had &s;oundings at 53 fathom, with a dark coloured &s;and; upon which we bent our cables.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t we had no ground with 150 fathom.<MILESTONE N="Friday 21" UNIT="day"> Our lat. at noon was 37&deg; 40&prime; S. long. 51&deg; 24&prime; W.</P>
<P>On the 22d we had &s;oundings again at 70 fathom,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 22" UNIT="day"> with a dark brown &s;and, and &s;aw many whales and &s;eals about the &s;hip, with a great number of butterflies, and birds, among which were &s;nipes and plover. Our lat. at noon was 38&deg; 55&prime; long. 56&deg; 47&prime; W.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="206">Our &s;oundings continued from 40 to 70 fathom, till the eighth of December,<MILESTONE N="December" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 8" UNIT="day"> when, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we &s;aw land bearing from S. W. to W. by S. and appearing like many &s;mall i&s;lands. At noon it bore from W. by S. to S. S. W. di&s;tant 8 leagues; our latitude then being 47&deg; 16&prime; S. long. 64&deg; 58&prime; W. About three o'clock Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> bore W. N. W. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, and a remarkable double &s;addle W. S. W. di&s;tant about three leagues. We had now &s;ound|ings from 20 to 16 fathom, &s;ometimes with coar&s;e &s;and and gravel, &s;ometimes with &s;mall black &s;tones and &s;hells. At eight in the evening the Tower rock at Port De&s;ire bore S. W. by W. di&s;tant about three leagues; and the extreams of the land from S. by E. to N. W. by N. At nine, Penguin I&s;land bore S.

<P>At noon Penguin i&s;land bore S. by E. di&s;tant 57 miles; our latitude being 48&deg; 56&prime; S. longitude 65&deg; 6&prime; W. This day we &s;aw &s;uch a quantity of red &s;hrimps about the &s;hip, that the &s;ea was coloured with them.</P>
<P>At noon the next day, Wedne&s;day the 10th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 10" UNIT="day"> the extreams of the land bore from S. W. to N. W. and Wood's Mount, near the entrance of Saint Julian's, bore S. W. by W. di&s;tant three or four leagues. Our latitude was 49&deg; 16&prime; S. our lon|gitude 66&deg; 48&prime; W.; and our &s;oundings were from 40 to 45 fathom, &s;ometimes fine &s;and, &s;ometimes &s;oft mud.</P>
<P>At noon, on Thur&s;day the 11th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> Penguin i&s;land bore N. N. E. di&s;tant 58 leagues. Our latitude was 50&deg; 48&prime; S. our longitude 67&deg; 10&prime; W.</P>
<P>We continued our cour&s;e till Saturday the 13th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 13" UNIT="day"> when our latitude being 50&deg; 34&prime; S. and our longitude 68&deg; 15&prime; W.
<PB N="371" REF="207">
the extreams of the land bore from N. &frac12; to S. S. W. &frac12; W. and the &s;hip was about five or &s;ix miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore.

<P>On Sunday the 14th, at four in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 14" UNIT="day"> Cape Beachy-head bore N.

We were &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore, and the extreams of the land were from N. W. to W. S. W.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock in the morning, of Monday the 15th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 15" UNIT="day"> being about &s;ix miles from the &s;hore, the extreams of the land bore from S. by E. to N. by E. and the entrance of the river Saint Croix S. W. &frac12; W. We had 20 fathom quite cro&s;s the opening, the di&s;tance from point to point being about &s;even miles, and afterwards keeping at the di&s;tance of about four miles from each cape, we had from 22 to 24 fathom. The land on the north &s;hore is high, and appears in three capes; that on the &s;outh &s;hore is low and flat. At &s;even in the eve|ning, Cape Fairweather bore S. W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant about four leagues, a low point running out from it S. S. W. &frac34; W. We &s;tood off and on all night, and had from 30 to 22 fathom water, with a bottom of &s;and and mud. At &s;even the next morning, Tue&s;day the 16th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> we &s;hoaled gradually into 12 fathom, with a bottom of fine &s;and, and &s;oon after into &s;ix: we then hauled off S. E. by S. &s;omewhat more than a mile; then &s;teered ea&s;t five miles, then E. by N. and deepened into 12 fathom. Cape Fairweather at this time bore W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant four leagues, and the northermo&s;t extremity of the land W. N. W. When we fir&s;t came into &s;hoal water, Cape Fairweather bore W. &frac12; N. and a low point without it W. S. W.

<P>At one o'clock, being about two leagues di&s;tant from the &s;hore, the extreams of three remarkable round hills bore from S. W. by W. to W. S. W. At four, Cape Virgin Mary bore S. E. by S. di&s;tant about four leagues. At eight, we were very near the Cape, and upon the point of it &s;aw &s;everal men riding, who made &s;igns for us to come on &s;hore. In about half an hour we anchored in a bay, clo&s;e under the &s;outh &s;ide of the Cape, in ten fathom water, with a gravelly bottom. The Swallow and &s;tore-&s;hip anchored &s;oon after between us and the Cape, which then bore N. by W. &frac12; W. and a low &s;andy point like Dungene&s;s S. by W. From the Cape there runs a &s;hoal, to the di&s;tance of about half a league, which may be ea&s;ily known by the weeds that are upon it. We found it high water at half an hour after eleven, and the tide ro&s;e twenty foot.</P>
<P>The natives continued abrea&s;t of the &s;hip all night, making &s;everal great fires, and frequently &s;houting very loud. As &s;oon as it was light,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> on Wedne&s;day morning the 17th, we &s;aw great numbers of them in motion, who made &s;igns for us to land. About five o'clock I made the &s;ignal for the boats belonging to the Swallow and the Prince Frederick to come on board, and in the mean time hoi&s;ted out our own. The&s;e boats being all manned and armed, I took a party of marines, and rowed towards the &s;hore, having left orders with the ma&s;ter to bring the &s;hip's broad-&s;ide to bear upon the landing place, and to keep the guns loaded with round &s;hot. We reached the beach about &s;ix o'clock, and before we went from the boat, I made &s;igns to the natives to retire
<PB N="373" REF="209">
to &s;ome di&s;tance: they immediately complied,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> and I then landed with the captain of the Swallow, and &s;everal of the officers: the marines were drawn up, and the boats were brought to a grappling near the &s;hore. I then made &s;igns to the natives to come near, and directed them to &s;it down in a &s;emicircle, which they did with great order and chearful|ne&s;s. When this was done, I di&s;tributed among them &s;eve|ral knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, buttons, beads, combs, and other toys, particularly &s;ome ribands to the women, which they re|ceived with a very becoming mixture of plea&s;ure and re&s;pect. Having di&s;tributed my pre&s;ents, I endeavoured to make them under&s;tand that I had other things which I would part with, but for which I expected &s;omewhat in return. I &s;hewed them &s;ome hatchets and bill-hooks, and pointed to &s;ome guanicoes, which happened to be near, and &s;ome o&s;triches which I &s;aw dead among them; making &s;igns at the &s;ame time that I wanted to eat; but they either could not, or would not under&s;tand me: for though they &s;eemed very de&s;irous of the hatchets and the bill-hooks, they did not give the lea&s;t intimation that they would part with any pro|vi&s;ions; no traffick therefore was carried on between us.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e people, both men and women, had a hor&s;e, with a decent &s;addle, &s;tirrups, and bridle. The men had wooden &s;purs, except one, who had a large pair of &s;uch as are worn in Spain, bra&s;s &s;tirrups, and a Spani&s;h cimeter, without a &s;cabbard; but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;tinctions, he did not appear to have any authority over the re&s;t: the women had no &s;purs. The hor&s;es appeared to be well made, and nimble, and were about 14 hands high. The people had al&s;o many dogs with them, which, as well as the hor&s;es, appeared to be of a Spani&s;h breed.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="210">As I had two mea&s;uring rods with me,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> we went round and mea&s;ured tho&s;e that appeared to be talle&s;t among them. One of the&s;e was &s;ix feet &s;even inches high, &s;everal more were &s;ix feet five, and &s;ix feet &s;ix inches; but the &s;tature of the greater part of them was from five feet ten to &s;ix feet. Their complexion is a dark copper colour, like that of the Indians in North America; their hair is &s;trait, and nearly as har&s;h as hog's bri&s;tles: it is tied back with a cotton &s;tring, but neither &s;ex wears any head-dre&s;s. They are well made, robu&s;t, and boney; but their hands and feet are remarkably &s;mall. They are cloathed with the &s;kins of the guanico, &s;ewed together into pieces about &s;ix foot long, and five wide: the&s;e are wrapped round the body, and fa&s;tened with a girdle, with the hairy &s;ide inwards; &s;ome of them had al&s;o what the Spaniards have called a <HI>puncho,</HI> a &s;quare piece of cloth made of the downy hair of the guanico, through which a hole being cut for the head, the re&s;t hangs round them about as low as the knee. The guanico is an animal that in &s;ize, make, and colour, re&s;embles a deer, but it has a hump on its back, and no horns. The&s;e people wear al&s;o a kind of drawers, which they pull up very tight, and bu&s;kins, which reach from the mid-leg to the in&s;tep before, and behind are brought under the heel; the re&s;t of the foot is without any covering. We ob&s;erved that &s;everal of the men had a red circle painted round the left eye, and that others were painted on their arms, and on different parts of the face; the eye-lids of all the young women were painted black. They talked much, and &s;ome of them called out Ca-pi-ta-ne; but when they were &s;poken to in Spani&s;h, Portugue&s;e, French, and Dutch, they made no reply. Of their own lan|guage we could di&s;tingui&s;h only one word, which was <HI>chevow:</HI> we &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a &s;alutation, as they always
<PB N="375" REF="211">
pronounced it when they &s;hook hands with us, and when,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> by &s;igns, they a&s;ked us to give them any thing. When they were &s;poken to in Engli&s;h, they repeated the words after us as plainly as we could do; and they &s;oon got by heart the words "Engli&s;hmen come on &s;hore." Every one had a mi&s;&s;ile weapon of a &s;ingular kind, tucked into the girdle. It con&s;i&s;ted of two round &s;tones, covered with leather, each weighing about a pound, which were fa&s;tened to the two ends of a &s;tring about eight feet long. This is u&s;ed as a &s;ling, one &s;tone being kept in the hand, and the other whirled round the head till it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have acquired &s;ufficient force, and then di&s;charged at the object. They are &s;o expert in the management of this double-headed &s;hot, that they will hit a mark, not bigger than a &s;hilling, with both the &s;tones, at the di&s;tance of fifteen yards; it is not their cu&s;tom, however, to &s;trike either the guanico or the o&s;trich with them in the chace, but they di&s;charge them &s;o that the cord comes again&s;t the legs of the o&s;trich, or two of the legs of the guanico, and is twi&s;ted round them by the force and &s;wing of the balls, &s;o that the animal being unable to run, becomes an ea&s;y prey to the hunter.</P>
<P>While we &s;tayed on &s;hore, we &s;aw them eat &s;ome of their fle&s;h meat raw, particularly the paunch of an o&s;trich, with|out any other preparation or cleaning than ju&s;t turning it in&s;ide out, and &s;haking it. We ob&s;erved among them &s;everal beads, &s;uch as I gave them, and two pieces of red baize, which we &s;uppo&s;ed had been left there, or in the neighbour|ing country, by Commodore Byron.</P>
<P>After I had &s;pent about four hours with the&s;e people, I made &s;igns to them that I was going on board, and that I would take &s;ome of them with me if they were de&s;irous to go. As &s;oon as I had made my&s;elf under&s;tood, above an hundred

eagerly offered to vi&s;it the &s;hip; <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> but I did not chu&s;e to in|dulge more than eight of the number. They jumped into the boats with the joy and alacrity of children going to a fair, and having no intention of mi&s;chief again&s;t us, had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that we intended any mi&s;chief again&s;t them. They &s;ung &s;everal of their country &s;ongs while they were in the boat, and when they came on board did not ex|pre&s;s either the curio&s;ity or wonder which the multiplicity of objects, to them equally &s;trange and &s;tupendous, that at once pre&s;ented them&s;elves, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to excite. I took them down into the cabbin, where they looked about them with an unaccountable indifference, till one of them happened to ca&s;t his eyes upon a looking-gla&s;s: this however excited no more a&s;toni&s;hment than the prodigies which offer them&s;elves to our imagination in a dream, when we con|ver&s;e with the dead, fly in the air, and walk upon the &s;ea, without reflecting that the laws of nature are violated; but it afforded them infinite diver&s;ion: they advanced, retreated, and played a thou&s;and tricks before it, laughing violently, and talking with great empha&s;is to each other. I gave them &s;ome beef, pork, bi&s;cuit, and other articles of the &s;hip's pro|vi&s;ions: they eat, indi&s;criminately, whatever was offered to them, but they would drink nothing but water. From the cabbin I carried them all over the &s;hip, but they looked at nothing with much attention, except the animals which we had on board as live &s;tock: they examined the hogs and &s;heep with &s;ome curio&s;ity, and were exceedingly delighted with the Guinea hens and turkies; they did not &s;eem to de&s;ire any thing that they &s;aw except our apparel, and only one of them, an old man, a&s;ked for that: we gratified him with a pair of &s;hoes and buckles, and to each of the others I gave a canvas bag, in which I put &s;ome needles ready threaded, a few &s;lips of cloth, a knife, a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, &s;ome twine, a

We offered them &s;ome leaves of tobacco, rolled up into what are called &s;egars, and they &s;moked a little, but did not &s;eem fond of it. I &s;howed them the great guns, but they did not appear to have any notion of their u&s;e. After I had carried them through the &s;hip, I ordered the marines to be drawn up, and go through part of their exerci&s;e. When the fir&s;t volley was fired, they were &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment and terror; the old man in particular, threw him&s;elf down upon the deck, pointed to the mu&s;kets, and then &s;triking his brea&s;t with his hand, lay &s;ome time motionle&s;s, with his eyes &s;hut: by this we &s;uppo&s;ed he intended to &s;hew us that he was not unacquainted with fire-arms, and their fatal effect. The re&s;t &s;eeing our people merry, and finding them|&s;elves unhurt, &s;oon re&s;umed their cheerfulne&s;s and good humour, and heard the &s;econd and third volley fired without much emotion; but the old man continued pro&s;trate upon the deck &s;ome time, and never recovered his &s;pirits till the firing was over. About noon, the tide being out, I acquainted them by &s;igns that the &s;hip was proceeding farther, and that they mu&s;t go on &s;hore: this I &s;oon perceived they were very unwilling to do; all however, except the old man and one more, were got into the boat without much difficulty; but the&s;e &s;topped at the gang-way, where the old man turned about, and went aft to the companion ladder, where he &s;tood &s;ome time without &s;peaking a word; he then uttered what we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a prayer; for he many times lifted up his hands and his eyes to the heavens, and &s;poke in a manner and tone very different from what we had ob&s;erved in their conver&s;ation: his orai&s;on &s;eemed to be rather &s;ung than &s;aid, &s;o that we found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h one

word from another.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> When I again intimated that it was proper for him to go into the boat, he pointed to the &s;un, and then moving his hand round to the we&s;t, he pau&s;ed, looked in my face, laughed, and pointed to the &s;hore: by this it was ea&s;y to under&s;tand that he wi&s;hed to &s;tay on board till &s;un-&s;et, and I took no little pains to convince him that we could not &s;tay &s;o long upon that part of the coa&s;t, before he could be prevailed upon to go into the boat; at length however he went over the &s;hip's &s;ide with his companion, and when the boat put off they all began to &s;ing, and con|tinued their merriment till they got on &s;hore. When they landed, great numbers of tho&s;e on &s;hore pre&s;&s;ed eagerly to get into the boat; but the officer on board, having po&s;itive orders to bring none of them off, prevented them, though not without great difficulty, and apparently to their extream mortification and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>When the boat returned on board, I &s;ent her off again with the ma&s;ter, to &s;ound the &s;hoal that runs off from the point: he found it about three miles broad from north to &s;outh, and that to avoid it, it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep four miles off the Cape, in twelve or thirteen fathom water.</P>

<P>ABOUT one o'clock, on Wedne&s;day the 17th of Decem|ber,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> I made the &s;ignal and weighed, ordering the Swallow to go a-head, and the &s;tore-&s;hip to bring up the rear. The wind was right again&s;t us, and blew fre&s;h, &s;o that we were obliged to turn into the Streight of Magellan with the flood-tide, between Cape Virgin Mary and the Sandy Point that re&s;embles Dungene&s;s. When we got a-brea&s;t of this Point, we &s;tood clo&s;e into the &s;hore, where we &s;aw two guanicoes, and many of the natives on hor&s;e|back, who &s;eemed to be in pur&s;uit of them: when the hor&s;emen came near, they ran up the country at a great rate, and were pur&s;ued by the hunters, with their &s;lings in their hands ready for the ca&s;t; but neither of them was taken while they were within the reach of our &s;ight.</P>
<P>When we got about two leagues to the we&s;t of Dungene&s;s, and were &s;tanding off &s;hore, we fell in with a &s;hoal upon which we had but &s;even fathom water at half flood: this obliged us to make &s;hort tacks, and keep continually heav|ing the lead. At half an hour after eight in the evening, we anchored about three miles from the &s;hore, in 20 fa|thom, with a muddy bottom: Cape Virgin Mary then bear|ing N. E. by E. &frac12; E.; Point Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion W. &frac12; S. at the di&s;tance of about five leagues.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="216">About half an hour after we had ca&s;t anchor,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> the natives made &s;everal large fires a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip, and at break of day we &s;aw about four hundred of them encamped in a fine green valley, between two hills, with their hor&s;es feeding be&s;ide them.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 18" UNIT="day"> About &s;ix o'clock in the morning, the tide being done, we got again under &s;ail: it's cour&s;e here is from ea&s;t to we&s;t; it ri&s;es and falls thirty feet, and its &s;trength is equal to about three knots an hour. About noon there being little wind, and the ebb running with great force, the Swallow, who was a-head, made the &s;ignal and came to an anchor; upon which I did the &s;ame, and &s;o did the &s;tore-&s;hip, that was a-&s;tern.</P>
<P>As we &s;aw great numbers of the natives on hor&s;eback a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip, and as Captain Carteret informed me that this was the place where Commodore Byron had the confe|rence with the tall men, I &s;ent the lieutenants of the Swal|low and the &s;tore-&s;hip to the &s;hore, but with orders not to land, as the &s;hips were at too great a di&s;tance to protect them. When the&s;e gentlemen returned, they told me that the boat having lain upon her oars very near the beach, the natives came down in great numbers, whom they knew to be the &s;ame per&s;ons they had &s;een the day before, with many others, particularly women and children; that when they perceived out people had no de&s;ign to land, they &s;eemed to be greatly di&s;appointed, and tho&s;e who had been on board the &s;hip waded off to the boat, making &s;igns for it to ad|vance, and pronouncing the words they had been taught, "Engli&s;hmen come on &s;hore," very loud, many times; that when they found they could not get the people to land, they would fain have got into the boat, and that it was with great difficulty they were prevented. That they pre&s;ented them

with &s;ome bread, tobacco, and a few toys, pointing at the &s;ame time to &s;ome guanicoes and o&s;triches, and making &s;igns that they wanted them as provi&s;ions, but that they could not make them&s;elves under&s;tood; that finding they could obtain no refre&s;hment, they rowed along the &s;hore in &s;earch of fre&s;h water, but that &s;eeing no appearance of a ri|vulet, they returned on board.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock the next morning, we weighed,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> the Swallow being &s;till a-head, and at noon we anchored in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion bay, having twelve fathom, with a clean &s;andy bottom. Point Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at this time bore Ea&s;t, di&s;tant three leagues; the A&s;&s;es Ears we&s;t, and the entrance of the Narrows S.

<P>From this time, to the 22d,<MILESTONE N="Monday 22" UNIT="day"> we had &s;trong gales and heavy feas, &s;o that we got on but &s;lowly; and we now anchored in 18 fathom, with a muddy bottom.

<P>In the morning of the 23d, we made &s;ail,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 23" UNIT="day"> turning to wind|ward, but the tide was &s;o &s;trong, that the Swallow was &s;et one way, the Dolphin another, and the &s;tore-&s;hip a third: there was a fre&s;h breeze, but not one of the ve&s;&s;els would an&s;wer her helm.

&s;ometimes backing,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 23" UNIT="day"> &s;ometimes filling, we entered the fir&s;t Narrows. About &s;ix o'clock in the evening, the tide being done, we anchored on the &s;outh &s;hore, in 40 fathom, with a &s;andy bottom; the Swallow anchored on the north &s;hore, and the &s;tore-&s;hip not a cable's length from a &s;and bank, about two miles to the ea&s;tward. The &s;treight here is only three miles wide, and at midnight, the tide being &s;lack, we weighed and towed the &s;hip through. A breeze &s;prung up &s;oon afterwards,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 24" UNIT="day"> which continued till &s;even in the morning, and then died away. We &s;teered from the fir&s;t Narrows to the &s;econd S. W. and had 19 fathom, with a muddy bottom. At eight we anchored two leagues from the &s;hore, in 24 fa|thom, Cape Gregory bearing W. &frac12; N. and Sweep&s;takes Fore|land S. W. &frac12; W. The tide here ran &s;even knots an hour, and &s;uch <HI>bores</HI> &s;ometimes came down, with immen&s;e quantities of weeds, that we expected every moment to be adrift.</P>
<P>The next day,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> being Chri&s;tmas day, we &s;ailed through the &s;econd Narrows. In turning through this part of the Streight we had 12 fathom within half a mile of the &s;hore on each &s;ide, and in the middle 17 fathom, 22 fathom, and no ground. At five o'clock in the evening, the &s;hip &s;uddenly &s;hoaled from 17 fathom to 5, St. Bartholomew's i&s;land then bearing S. &frac12; W. di&s;tant between three and four miles, and Elizabeth i&s;land S. S. W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant five or &s;ix miles. About half an hour after eight o'clock, the weather being rainy and tempe&s;tuous, we anchored under Elizabeth i&s;land in 24 fathom, with hard gravelly ground. Upon this i&s;land we found great quantities of celery, which, by the direc|tion of the &s;urgeon, was given to the people, with boiled wheat and portable &s;oup, for breakfa&s;t every morning. Some of the officers who went a&s;hore with their guns, &s;aw two &s;mall dogs, and &s;everal places where fires had been recently

<P>From this place we &s;aw many high mountains, bearing from S. to W. S. W.; &s;everal parts of the &s;ummits were co|vered with &s;now, though it was the mid&s;t of &s;ummer in this part of the world: they were clothed with wood about three parts of their height, and above with herbage, except where the &s;now was not yet melted. This was the fir&s;t place where we had &s;een wood in all South America.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the morning of the 26th, we weighed,<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> and having a fair wind, were a-brea&s;t of the north end of Elizabeth's i&s;land at three: at half an hour after five, being about mid-way between Elizabeth's i&s;land and St. George's i&s;land, we &s;uddenly &s;hoaled our water from 17 fathom to &s;ix: we &s;truck the ground once, but the next ca&s;t had no bottom with 20 fathom. When we were upon this &s;hoal, Cape Porpoi&s;e bore W. S. W. &frac12; W. the &s;outh-end of Elizabeth's i&s;land W. N. W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant three leagues, and the &s;outh-end of Saint George's i&s;land N. E. di&s;tant four leagues. The &s;tore-&s;hip, which was about half a league to the &s;outhward of us, had once no more than four fathom, and for a con|&s;iderable time not &s;even; the Swallow, which was three or four miles to the &s;outhward, had deep water, for &s;he kept near to St. George's i&s;land. In my opinion it is &s;afe&s;t to run down from the north-end of Elizabeth's i&s;land, about two or three miles from the &s;hore, and &s;o on all the way to Port Famine. At noon, a low point bore E. &frac12; N. Fre&s;h-water Bay S. W. &frac12; W. At this time we were about three miles di&s;tant

<P>About four o'clock we anchored in Port Famine Bay, in 13 fathom, and there being little wind, &s;ent all the boats, and towed in the Swallow and Prince Frederick.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> the weather being &s;qually, we warped the &s;hip farther into the harbour, and moored her with a cable each way in nine fathom. I then &s;ent a party of men to pitch two large tents in the bottom of the bay, for the &s;ick, the wooders, and the &s;ail-makers, who were &s;oon after &s;ent on &s;hore with the &s;urgeon, the gunner, and &s;ome mid&s;hipmen. Cape St. Anne now bore N. E. by E. di&s;tant three quarters of a mile, and Sedger River S. &frac12; W.</P>
<P>On the 28th we unbent all the &s;ails,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 28" UNIT="day"> and &s;ent them on &s;hore to be repaired, erected tents upon the banks of Sedger River, and &s;ent all the empty ca&s;ks on &s;hore, with the coopers to trim them, and a mate and ten men to wa&s;h and fill them. We al&s;o hauled the &s;eine, and caught fi&s;h in great plenty: &s;ome of them re&s;embled a mullet, but the fle&s;h was very &s;oft; and among them were a few &s;melts, &s;ome of which were twenty inches long, and weighed four and twenty ounces.</P>
<P>During our whole &s;tay in this place, we caught fi&s;h enough to furni&s;h one meal a day both for the &s;ick and the well: we found al&s;o great plenty of celery and pea-tops, which were boiled with the pea&s;e and portable &s;oup: be&s;ides the&s;e, we gathered great quantities of fruit that re&s;embled the cranberry, and the leaves of a &s;hrub &s;omewhat like our thorn, which were remarkably &s;our. When we arrived, all our people began to look pale and meagre; many had the &s;curvy to a great degree, and upon others there were ma|nife&s;t &s;igns of its approach; yet in a fortnight there was not

a &s;corbutic per&s;on in either of the &s;hips. Their recovery was effected by their being on &s;hore, eating plenty of vegetables, being obliged to wa&s;h their apparel, and keep their per&s;ons clean by daily bathing in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The next day we &s;et up the forge on &s;hore; <MILESTONE N="Monday 29" UNIT="day"> and from this time, the armourers, carpenters, and the re&s;t of the people were employed in refitting the &s;hip, and making her ready for the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In the mean time, a con&s;iderable quantity of wood was cut, and put on board the &s;tore-&s;hip, to be &s;ent to Falkland's i&s;land; and as I well knew there was no wood growing there, I cau&s;ed &s;ome thou&s;ands of young trees to be care|fully taken up with their roots, and a proper quantity of earth; and packing them in the be&s;t manner I could, I put them al&s;o on board the &s;tore-&s;hip, with orders to deliver them to the commanding officer at Port Egmont, and to &s;ail for that place with the fir&s;t fair wind, putting on board two of my &s;eamen, who being in an ill &s;tate of health when they fir&s;t came on board, were now altogether unfit to proceed in the voyage.</P>

He reported al&s;o, that he had &s;een a great number of currant bu&s;hes full of fruit, though none of it was ripe, and a great variety of beautiful &s;hrubs in full blo&s;&s;om, bearing flowers of different colours, particularly red, purple, yellow, and white, be&s;ides great plenty of the winter's bark, a grateful &s;pice which is well known to the botani&s;ts of Europe. He &s;hot &s;everal wild ducks, gee&s;e, gulls, a hawk, and two or three of the birds which the &s;ailors call a Race-Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the morning of Sunday the 18th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 18" UNIT="day"> we made &s;ail, and at noon, being about two miles from the &s;hore, Cape Froward bore N. by E. a bluff point N. N. W. and Cape Holland W. &frac12; S. Our latitude at this place, by ob&s;er|vation, was 54&deg; 3&prime; S. and we found the Streight to be about &s;ix miles wide. Soon after I &s;ent a boat into Snug bay, to lie at the anchoring place, but the wind coming from the land, I &s;tood off again all night; and at a mile from the &s;hore, we had no ground with 140 fathom.</P>
<P>In the morning of Monday the 19th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 19" UNIT="day"> the Swallow having made the &s;ignal for anchoring under Cape Holland, we ran in, and anchored in 10 fathom, with a clear &s;andy bottom. Upon &s;ending the boats out to &s;ound, we di&s;covered that we were very near a reef of rocks; we therefore tripped the an|chor, and dropped farther out, where we had 12 fathom, and were about half a mile from the &s;hore, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to a large &s;tream of water which falls with great rapidity from
<PB N="387" REF="223">
the mountains, for the land he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is of a &s;tupendous height. Cape Holland bore W. S. W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant two miles, and Cape Froward E. Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 53&deg; 58&prime; S.</P>
<P>The next morning we got off &s;ome water,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 20" UNIT="day"> and great plenty of wild celery, but could get no fi&s;h, except a few mu&s;cles. I &s;ent off the boats to &s;ound, and found that there was good anchorage at about half a mile from the &s;hore, quite from the Cape to four miles below it; and clo&s;e by the Cape a good harbour, where a &s;hip might refre&s;h with more &s;afety than at Port Famine, and avail her&s;elf of a large river of fre&s;h water, with plenty of wood, celery, and berries; though the place affords no fi&s;h except mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>Having completed our wood and water,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;. 22" UNIT="day"> we &s;ailed from this place on the 22d, about three o'clock in the afternoon. At nine in the evening, the &s;hip being about two miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore, Cape Gallant bore W. &frac12; N. di&s;tant two leagues, Cape Holland E. by N. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues; Cape Gallant and Cape Holland being nearly in one: a white patch in Monmouth's i&s;land bore S. S. W. &frac34; W. Rupert's i&s;land W. S. W. At this place the Streight is not more than five miles over; and we found a tide which produced a very un|u&s;ual effect, for it became impo&s;&s;ible to keep the &s;hip's head upon any point.</P>
<P>At &s;ix the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Friday 23" UNIT="day"> the Swallow made the &s;ignal for having found anchorage; and at eight we anchored in a bay under Cape Gallant, in 10 fathom, with a muddy bottom. The ea&s;t point of Cape Gallant bore S. W. by W. &frac14; W. the ex|tream point of the ea&s;termo&s;t land E. by S. a point making the mouth of a river N. by W. and the white patch on Charles's i&s;land S. W. The boats being &s;ent out to &s;ound, found good anchorage every where, except within two cables length S. W. of the &s;hip, where it was coral, and
<PB N="388" REF="224">
deepened to 16 fathom. In the afternoon I &s;ent out the ma&s;ter to examine the bay and a large lagoon; and he reported that the lagoon was the mo&s;t commodious harbour we had yet &s;een in the Streight, having five fathom at the entrance, and from four to live in the middle; that it was capable of re|ceiving a great number of ve&s;&s;els, had three large fre&s;h water rivers, and plenty of wood and celery. We had here the misfortune to have a &s;eine &s;poiled, by being entangled with the wood that lies &s;unk at the mouth of the&s;e rivers; but though we caught but little fi&s;h, we had an incredible number of wild ducks, which we found a very good &s;ucce|daneum.</P>
<P>The mountains are here very lofty, and the ma&s;ter of the Swallow climbed one of the highe&s;t, hoping that from the &s;ummit he &s;hould obtain a fight of the South Sea; but he found his view intercepted by mountains &s;till higher on the &s;outhern &s;hore: before he de&s;cended, however, he erected a pyramid, within which he depo&s;ited a bottle containing a &s;hilling, and a paper on which was written the &s;hip's name and the date of the year; a memorial which po&s;&s;ibly may remain there as long as the world endures.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 24th we took two boats and ex|amined Cordes bay,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 24" UNIT="day"> which we found very much inferior to that in which the &s;hip lay; it had indeed a larger lagoon, but the entrance of it was very narrow, and barred by a &s;hoal, on which there was not &s;ufficient depth of water for a &s;hip of burden to float: the entrance of the bay al&s;o was rocky, and within it the ground was foul.</P>
<P>In this place we &s;aw an animal that re&s;embled an a&s;s, but it had a cloven hoof, as we di&s;covered afterwards by tracking it, and was as &s;wift as a deer. This was the fir&s;t animal we had &s;een in the Streight, except at the entrance, where we
<PB N="389" REF="225">
found the guanicoes that we would fain have trafficked for with the Indians. We &s;hot at this creature, but we could not hit it; probably it is altogether unknown to the natura|li&s;ts of Europe.</P>
<P>The country about this place has the mo&s;t dreary and for|lorn appearance that can be imagined; the mountains on each &s;ide the Streight are of an immen&s;e height: about one fourth of the a&s;cent is covered with trees of a con&s;iderable &s;ize; in the &s;pace from thence to the middle of the mountain there is nothing but withered &s;hrubs; above the&s;e are patches of &s;now, and fragments of broken rock; and the &s;ummit is altogether rude and naked, towering above the clouds in va&s;t crags that are piled upon each other, and look like the ruins of Nature devoted to everla&s;ting &s;terility and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>We went over in two boats to the Royal I&s;lands, and &s;ounded, but found no bottom: a very rapid tide &s;et through wherever there was an opening; and they cannot be ap|proached by &s;hipping without the mo&s;t imminent danger. Whoever navigates this part of the Streight, &s;hould keep the north &s;hore clo&s;e on board all the way, and not venture more than a mile from it till the Royal I&s;lands are pa&s;&s;ed. The current &s;ets ea&s;terly through the whole four and twenty hours, and the indraught &s;hould by all means be avoided. The latitude of Cape Gallant road is 53&deg; 50&prime; S.</P>
<P>We continued in this &s;tation, taking in wood and water, and gathering mu&s;cles and herbs,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day. 27" UNIT="day"> till the morning of the 27th, when a boat that had been &s;ent to try the current, re|turned with an account that it &s;et nearly at the rate of two miles an hour, but that the wind being northerly, we might probably get round to Elizabeth bay or York road before night; we therefore weighed with all expedition. At noon on the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 28" UNIT="day"> the we&s;t point of Cape Gallant bore W. N. W.
<PB N="390" REF="226">
di&s;tant half a mile, and the white patch on Charles's i&s;land S. E. by S. We had fre&s;h gales and heavy flaws off the land; and at two o'clock the we&s;t point of Cape Gallant bore E. di&s;tant three leagues, and York Point W. N. W. di&s;tant five leagues. At five, we opened York road, the Point bearing N. W. at the di&s;tance of half a mile: at this time the &s;hip was taken a-back, and a &s;trong current with a heavy &s;quall drove us &s;o far to leeward, that it was with great difficulty we got into Elizabeth bay, and anchored in 12 fathom near a river. The Swallow being at anchor off the point of the bay, and very near the rocks, I &s;ent all the boats with an|chors and hau&s;ers to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and at la&s;t &s;he was happily warped to windward into good anchorage. York Point now bore W. by N. a &s;hoal with weeds upon it W. N. W. at the di&s;tance of a cable's length, Point Pa&s;&s;age S. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant half a mile, a rock near Rupert's i&s;le S. &frac12; E. and a ri|vulet on the bay N. E. by E. di&s;tant about three cable's length. Soon after &s;un-&s;et we &s;aw a great &s;moke on the &s;outhern &s;hore, and another on Prince Rupert's i&s;land.</P>
<P>Early in the morning I &s;ent the boats on &s;hore for water,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 29" UNIT="day"> and &s;oon after our people landed, three canoes put off from the &s;outh &s;hore, and landed &s;ixteen of the natives on the ea&s;t point of the bay. When they came within about a hundred yards of our people they &s;topt, called out, and made &s;igns of friend&s;hip; our people did the &s;ame, &s;hewing them &s;ome beads and other toys. At this they &s;eemed plea&s;ed, and be|gan to &s;hout; our people imitated the noi&s;e they made, and &s;houted in return: the Indians then advanced, &s;till &s;houting and laughing very loud. When the parties met they &s;hook hands, and our men pre&s;ented the Indians with &s;everal of the toys which they had &s;hewn them at a di&s;tance. They were covered with &s;eal &s;kins, which &s;tunk abominably, and &s;ome of them were eating the rotten fle&s;h and blubber raw,
<PB N="391" REF="227">
with a keen appetite and great &s;eeming &s;atisfaction.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 29" UNIT="day"> Their complexion was the &s;ame as that of the people we had &s;een before, but they were low of &s;tature, the talle&s;t of them not being more than five foot &s;ix: they appeared to be peri&s;hing with cold, and immediately kindled &s;everal fires. How they &s;ub&s;i&s;t in winter, it is not perhaps ea&s;y to gue&s;s, for the wea|ther was at this time &s;o &s;evere, that we had frequent falls of &s;now. They were armed with bows, arrows, and javelins: the arrows and javelins were pointed with flint, which was wrought into the &s;hape of a &s;erpent's tongue; and they di&s;|charged both with great force and dexterity, &s;carce ever fail|ing to hit a mark at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. To kindle a fire they &s;trike a pebble again&s;t a piece of mundic, holding under it, to catch the &s;parks, &s;ome mo&s;s or down, mixed with a whiti&s;h earth, which takes fire like tinder: they then take &s;ome dry gra&s;s, of which there is every where plenty, and putting the lighted mo&s;s into it, wave it to and fro, and in about a minute it blazes.</P>
<P>When the boat returned &s;he brought three of them on board the &s;hip, but they &s;eemed to regard nothing with any degree of curio&s;ity except our cloaths and a looking-gla&s;s; the looking-gla&s;s afforded them as much diver&s;ion as it had done the Patagonians, and it &s;eemed to &s;urprize them more: when they fir&s;t peeped into it they &s;tarted back, fir&s;t looking at us, and then at each other; they then took another peep, as it were by &s;tealth, &s;tarting back as before, and then eagerly looking behind it: when by degrees they became familiar with it, they &s;miled, and &s;eeing the image &s;mile in return, they were exceedingly delighted, and bur&s;t into fits of the mo&s;t violent laughter. They left this however, and every thing el&s;e, with perfect indifference, the little they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed being to all appearance equal to their de&s;ires. They
<PB N="392" REF="228">
eat whatever was given them,<MILESTONE N="February" UNIT="month"> but would drink nothing but water.</P>
<P>When they left the &s;hip I went on &s;hore with them, and by this time &s;everal of their wives and children were come to the watering-place. I di&s;tributed &s;ome trinkets among them, with which they &s;eemed plea&s;ed for a moment, and they gave us &s;ome of their arms in return; they gave us al&s;o &s;everal pieces of mundic, &s;uch as is found in the tin mines of Cornwall: they made us under&s;tand that they found it in the mountains, where there are probably mines of tin, and perhaps of more valuable metal. As this &s;eems to be the mo&s;t dreary and inho&s;pitable country in the world, not excepting the wor&s;t parts of Sweden and Norway, the people &s;eem to be the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t deplorable of all human beings. Their perfect indifference to every thing they &s;aw, which marked the di&s;parity between our &s;tate and their own, though it may pre&s;erve them from the regret and angui&s;h of un&s;atisfied de&s;ires, &s;eems, notwith&s;tanding, to imply a defect in their nature; for tho&s;e who are &s;atisfied with the gratifications of a brute, can have little preten&s;ion to the prerogatives of men. When they left us and em|barked in their canoes, they hoi&s;ted a &s;eal &s;kin for a &s;ail, and &s;teered for the &s;outhern &s;hore, where we &s;aw many of their hovels; and we remarked that not one of them looked be|hind, either at us or at the &s;hip, &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion had the wonders they had &s;een made upon their minds, and &s;o much did they appear to be ab&s;orbed in the pre&s;ent, without any habitual exerci&s;e of their power to reflect upon the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>In this &s;tation we continued till Tue&s;day the 3d of Fe|bruary.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> At about half an hour pa&s;t twelve we weighed, and in a &s;udden &s;quall were taken a-back, &s;o as that both &s;hips were in the mo&s;t imminent danger of being driven a&s;hore
<PB N="393" REF="229">
on a reef of rocks; the wind however &s;uddenly &s;hifted,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> and we happily got off without damage. At five o'clock in the afternoon, the tide being done, and the wind coming about to the we&s;t, we bore away for York road, and at length an|chored in it: the Swallow at the &s;ame time being very near I&s;land bay, under Cape Quod, endeavoured to get in there, but was by the tide obliged to return to York road. In this &s;ituation Cape Quod bore W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant 19 miles, York Point E. S. E. di&s;tant one mile, Bachelor's River N. N. W. three quarters of a mile, the entrance of Jerom's Sound N. W. by W. and a &s;mall i&s;land on the &s;outh &s;hore W. by S. We found the tide here very rapid and uncertain; in the &s;tream it ge|nerally &s;et to the ea&s;tward, but it &s;ometimes, though rarely, &s;et we&s;tward &s;ix hours together. This evening we &s;aw five Indian canoes come out of Bachelor's River, and go up Je|rom's Sound.</P>
<P>In the morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 4" UNIT="day"> the boats which I had &s;ent out to &s;ound both the &s;hores of the Streight and all parts of the bay, re|turned with an account that there was good anchorage with|in Jerom's Sound, and all the way thither from the &s;hip's &s;tation at the di&s;tance of about half a mile from the &s;hore; al&s;o between Elizabeth and York Point, near York Point, at the di&s;tance of a cable and a half's length from the weeds, in 16 fathom with a muddy bottom. There were al&s;o &s;everal places under the i&s;lands on the &s;outh &s;hore where a &s;hip might anchor; but the force and uncertainty of the tides, and the heavy gu&s;ts of wind that came off the high lands, by which the&s;e &s;ituations were &s;urrounded, rendered them un&s;afe. Soon after the boats returned, I put fre&s;h hands into them and went my&s;elf up Bachelor's River: we found a bar at the entrance, which at certain times of the tide mu&s;t be dangerous. We hauled the &s;eine, and &s;hould have caught plenty of fi&s;h if it had not been for the weeds and
<PB N="394" REF="230">
&s;tumps of trees at the bottom of the river. We then went a&s;hore, where we &s;aw many wigwams of the natives, and &s;everal of their dogs, who, as &s;oon as we came in &s;ight, ran away. We al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome o&s;triches, but they were beyond the reach of our pieces: we gathered mu&s;cles, limpets, &s;ea-eggs, celery, and nettles in great abundance. About three miles up this river, on the we&s;t &s;ide, between Mount Mi&s;ery and another mountain of a &s;tupendous height, there is a ca|taract which has a very &s;triking appearance: it is precipitated from an elevation of above four hundred yards; half the way it rolls over a very &s;teep declivity, and the other half is a perpendicular fall. The &s;ound of this cataract is not le&s;s awful than the &s;ight.</P>
<P>In this place, contrary winds detained us till 10 o'clock in the morning of Saturday the 14th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 14" UNIT="day"> when we weighed, and in half an hour the current &s;et the &s;hip towards Bachelor's River: we then put her in &s;tays, and while &s;he was coming about, which &s;he was long in doing, we drove over a &s;hoal where we had little more than 16 feet water with rocky ground; &s;o that our danger was very great, for the &s;hip drew 16 feet 9 inches aft, and 15 feet one inch forward: as &s;oon as the &s;hip gathered way, we happily deepened into three fathom; within two cables' length we had five, and in a very &s;hort time we got into deep water. We continued plying to windward till four o'clock in the afternoon, and then finding that we had lo&s;t ground, we returned to our &s;tation, and again anchored in York road.</P>
<P>Here we remained till five o'clock in the morning of the 17th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> when we weighed, and towed out of the road. At nine, though we had a fine breeze at we&s;t, the &s;hip was car|ried with great violence by a current towards the &s;outh &s;hore: the boats were all towing a-head, and the &s;ails a&s;leep, yet we
<PB N="395" REF="231">
drove &s;o clo&s;e to the rock,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> that the oars of the boats were entangled in the weeds. In this manner we were hurried along near three quarters of an hour, expecting every mo|ment to be da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the cliff, from which we were &s;eldom farther than a &s;hip's length, and very often not half &s;o much. We &s;ounded on both &s;ides, and found that next the &s;hore we had from 14 to 20 fathom, and on the other &s;ide of the &s;hip no bottom: as all our efforts were in|effectual, we re&s;igned our&s;elves to our fate, and waited the event in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e very little different from de&s;pair. At length, however, we opened Saint David's Sound, and a current that ru&s;hed out of it &s;et us into the mid-channel. During all this time the Swallow was on the north &s;hore, and con&s;equently could know nothing of our danger till it was pa&s;t. We now &s;ent the boats out to look for an anchor|ing place; and at noon Cape Quod bore N. N. E. and Saint David's head S. E.</P>
<P>About one o'clock the boats returned, having found an anchoring place in a &s;mall bay, to which we gave the name of Butler's bay, it having been di&s;covered by Mr. Butler one of the mates. It lies to the we&s;t of Rider's bay on the &s;outh &s;hore of the Streight, which is here about two miles wide. We ran in with the tide which &s;et fa&s;t to the we&s;tward, and anchored in 16 fathom water. The extreams of the bay from W. by N. to N. &frac12; W. are about a quarter of a mile a&s;un|der; a &s;mall rivulet, at the di&s;tance of &s;omewhat le&s;s than two cables' length, bore S. &frac12; W. and Cape Quod N. at the di&s;tance of four miles. At this time the Swallow was at an|chor in I&s;land bay on the north &s;hore, at about &s;ix miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I now &s;ent all the boats out to &s;ound round the &s;hip and in the neighbouring bays; and they returned with an ac|count
<PB N="396" REF="232">
that they could find no place fit to receive the &s;hip, neither could any &s;uch place be found between Cape Quod and Cape Notch.</P>
<P>In this place we remained till Friday the 20th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 20" UNIT="day"> when about noon the clouds gathered very thick to the we&s;tward, and before one it blew a &s;torm, with &s;uch rain and hail as we had &s;carcely ever &s;een. We immediately &s;truck the yards and top-ma&s;ts, and having run out two hau&s;ers to a rock, we hove the &s;hip up to it: we then let go the &s;mall bower, and veered away, and brought both cables a-head; at the &s;ame time we carried out two more hau&s;ers, and made them fa&s;t to two other rocks, making u&s;e of every expedient in our power to keep the &s;hip &s;teady. The gale continued to increa&s;e till &s;ix o'clock in the evening, and to our great a&s;toni&s;hment the &s;ea broke quite over the fore-ca&s;tle in upon the quarter-deck, which, con&s;idering the narrowne&s;s of the Streight, and the &s;mallne&s;s of the bay in which we were &s;tationed, might well have been thought impo&s;&s;ible. Our danger here was very great, for if the cables had parted, as we could not run out with a &s;ail, and as we had not room to bring the &s;hip up with any other anchor, we mu&s;t have been da&s;hed to pieces in a few minutes, and in &s;uch a &s;ituation it is highly probable that every &s;oul would immediately have pe|ri&s;hed; however, by eight o'clock the gale was become &s;ome|what more moderate, and gradually decrea&s;ing during the night,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 21" UNIT="day"> we had tolerable weather the next morning. Upon heaving the anchor, we had the &s;atisfaction to find that our cable was &s;ound, though our hau&s;ers were much rubbed by the rocks, notwith&s;tanding they were parcelled with old ham|macoes, and other things. The fir&s;t thing I did after perform|ing the nece&s;&s;ary operations about the &s;hip, was to &s;end a boat to the Swallow to enquire how &s;he had fared during the gale: the boat returned with an account that &s;he had felt but
<PB N="397" REF="233">
little of the gale, but that &s;he had been very near being lo&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 21" UNIT="day"> in pu&s;hing through the I&s;lands two days before, by the rapidity of the tide: that notwith&s;tanding an alteration which had been made in her rudder, &s;he &s;teered and worked &s;o ill, that every time they got under way they were apprehen&s;ive that &s;he could never &s;afely be brought to an anchor again; I was therefore reque&s;ted, in the name of the captain, to con&s;ider that &s;he could be of very little &s;ervice to the expedition, and to direct what I thought would be be&s;t for the &s;ervice. I an&s;wered, that as the Lords of the Admiralty had appointed her to accompany the Dolphin, &s;he mu&s;t continue to do it as long as it was po&s;&s;ible; that as her condition rendered her a bad &s;ailer, I would wait her time, and attend her motions, and that if any di&s;a&s;ter &s;hould happen to either of us, the other &s;hould be ready to afford &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as might be in her power.</P>
<P>We continued here eight days, during which time we completed our wood and water, dried our &s;ails, and &s;ent great part of the &s;hip's company on &s;hore, to wa&s;h their cloathes and &s;tretch their legs, which was the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the cold, &s;nowy, and tempe&s;tuous weather had confined them too much below. We caught mu&s;cles and limpets, and gathered celery and nettles in great abundance. The mu&s;|cles were the large&s;t we had ever &s;een, many of them being from five to &s;ix inches long: we caught al&s;o great plenty of a fine, firm, red fi&s;h, not unlike a gurnet, mo&s;t of which were from four to five pounds weight. At the &s;ame time, we made it part of the employment of every day to try the current, which we found con&s;tantly &s;etting to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter having been &s;ent out to look for anchoring places, returned with an account that he could find no &s;helter, except near the &s;hore, where it &s;hould not be &s;ought but in
<PB N="398" REF="234">
ca&s;es of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 21" UNIT="day"> He landed upon a large i&s;land on the north &s;ide of Snow Sound, and being almo&s;t peri&s;hed with cold, the fir&s;t thing he did was to make a large fire, with &s;ome &s;mall trees which he found upon the &s;pot. He then climbed one of the rocky mountains, with Mr. Picker&s;gill, a mid&s;hipman, and one of the &s;eamen, to take a view of the Streight, and the di&s;mal regions that &s;urround it. He found the entrance of the Sound to be full as broad as &s;everal parts of the Streight, and to grow but very little narrower, for &s;everal miles in land on the Terra del Fuego &s;ide. The country on the &s;outh of it was &s;till more dreary and horrid than any he had yet &s;een: it con&s;i&s;ted of craggy mountains, much higher than the clouds, that were alto|gether naked from the ba&s;e to the &s;ummit, there not being a &s;ingle &s;hrub, nor even a blade of gra&s;s to be &s;een upon them; nor were the vallies between them le&s;s de&s;olate, being intirely covered with deep beds of &s;now, except here and there where it had been wa&s;hed away, or converted into ice, by the torrents which were precipitated from the fi&s;&s;ures and crags of the mountain above, where the &s;now had been di&s;&s;olved; and even the&s;e vallies, in the patches that were free from &s;now, were as de&s;titute of verdure as the rocks between which they lay.</P>
<P>On Sunday the fir&s;t of March,<MILESTONE N="March" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Sunday 1" UNIT="day"> at half an hour after four o'clock in the morning, we &s;aw the Swallow under &s;ail, on the north &s;hore of Cape Quod. At &s;even we weighed, and &s;tood out of Butler's bay, but it falling calm &s;oon afterwards, the boats were obliged to take the ve&s;&s;el in tow, having with much difficulty kept clear of the rocks: the pa&s;&s;age being very narrow, we &s;ent the boats, about noon, to &s;eek for anchorage on the north &s;hore. At this time, Cape Notch bore W. by N. &frac12; N. di&s;tant between three and four leagues, and Cape Quod E. &frac12; N. di&s;tant three leagues.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="235">About three o'clock in the afternoon, there being little wind, we anchored, with the Swallow, under the north &s;hore, in a &s;mall bay, where there is a high, &s;teep, rocky mountain, the top of which re&s;embles the head of a lion, for which rea&s;on we called the bay Lion's Cove. We had here 40 fathom, with deep water clo&s;e to the &s;hore, and at half a cable's length without the &s;hip, no ground. We &s;ent the boats to the we&s;tward in &s;earch of anchoring places, and at midnight they returned with an account that there was an indifferent bay at the di&s;tance of about four miles, and that Goodluck bay was three leagues to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>At half an hour after 12 the next day,<MILESTONE N="Monday 2" UNIT="day"> the wind being northerly, we made &s;ail from Lion's Cove, and at five an|chored in Good Luck bay, at the di&s;tance of about half a cable's length from the rocks, in 28 fathom water. A rocky i&s;land at the we&s;t extremity of the bay bore N. W. by W. di&s;tant about a cable's length and a half, and a low point, which makes the ea&s;tern extremity of the bay, bore E. S. E. di&s;tant about a mile. Between this point and the &s;hip, there were many &s;hoals, and in the bottom of the bay two rocks, the large&s;t of which bore N. E. by N. the &s;malle&s;t N. by E. From the&s;e rocks, &s;hoals run out to the S. E. which may be known by the weeds that are upon them; the &s;hip was within a cable's length of them: when &s;he &s;wung with her &s;tern in &s;hore, we had 16 fathom, with coral rock; when &s;he &s;wung off, we had 50 fathom, with &s;andy ground. Cape Notch bore from us W. by S. &frac12; W. di&s;tant about one league; and in the intermediate &s;pace there was a large lagoon which we could not &s;ound, the wind blowing too hard all the while we lay here. After we had moored the &s;hip, we &s;ent two boats to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Swallow, and one to look out for anchorage beyond Cape Notch. The boats that were &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Swallow, towed her into a &s;mall bay, where,
<PB N="400" REF="236">
as the wind was &s;outherly, and blew fre&s;h, &s;he was in great danger, for the Cove was not only &s;mall, but full of rocks, and open to the &s;outh-ea&s;terly winds.</P>
<P>All the day following,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> and all the night, we had hard gales, with a great &s;ea, and much hail and rain. The next morning we had gu&s;ts &s;o violent,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 4" UNIT="day"> that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tand the deck; they brought whole &s;heets of water all the way from Cape Notch, which was a league di&s;tant, quite over the deck. They did not la&s;t more than a minute, but were &s;o frequent, that the cables were kept in a con&s;tant &s;train, and there was the greate&s;t rea&s;on to fear that they would give way. It was a general opinion that the Swallow could not po&s;&s;ibly ride it out, and &s;ome of the men were &s;o &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the notion of her being lo&s;t, that they fancied they &s;aw &s;ome of her people coming over the rocks towards our &s;hip. The weather continued &s;o bad, till Saturday the &s;eventh,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 7" UNIT="day"> that we could &s;end no boat to enquire after her; but the gale being then more moderate, a boat was di&s;patched about four o'clock in the morning, which, about the &s;ame hour in the afternoon, returned with an ac|count that the &s;hip was &s;afe, but that the fatigue of the peo|ple had been incredible, the whole crew having been upon the deck near three days and three nights. At midnight the gu&s;ts returned, though not with equal violence, with hail, &s;leet and &s;now. The weather being now extremely cold, and the people never dry,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 8" UNIT="day"> I got up, the next morning, eleven bales of thick woollen &s;tuff, called Fearnought, which is provided by the government, and &s;et all the taylors to work to make them into jackets, of which every man in the &s;hip had one.</P>
<P>I ordered the&s;e jackets to be made very large, allowing, one with another, two yards and thirty-four inches of the cloth
<PB N="401" REF="237">
to each jacket. I &s;ent al&s;o &s;even bales of the &s;ame cloth to the Swallow, which made every man on board a jacket of the &s;ame kind; and I cut up three bales of finer cloth, and made jackets for the officers of both &s;hips, which I had the plea&s;ure to find were very acceptable.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation we were obliged to continue a week, during which time, I put both my own &s;hip, and the Swal|low, upon two-thirds allowance, except brandy; but conti|nued the breakfa&s;t as long as greens and water were plenty.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 15th, about noon,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 15" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw the Swallow under &s;ail, and it being calm, we &s;ent our launch to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. In the evening the launch returned, having towed her into a very good harbour on the &s;outh &s;hore, oppo&s;ite to where we lay. The account that we received of this har|bour, determined us to get into it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; the next morning therefore, at eight o'clock, we &s;ailed from Good Luck bay, and thought our&s;elves happy to get &s;afe out of it. When we got a-brea&s;t of the harbour where the Swal|low lay, we fired &s;everal guns, as &s;ignals for her boats to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in getting in; and in a &s;hort time the ma&s;ter came on board us, and piloted us to a very commodious &s;tation, where we anchored in 28 fathom, with a muddy bottom. This harbour, which is &s;heltered from all winds, and excel|lent in every re&s;pect, we called SWALLOW HARBOUR. There are two channels into it, which are both narrow, but not dangerous, as the rocks are ea&s;ily di&s;covered by the weeds that grow upon them.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 16" UNIT="day"> the wind coming ea&s;t|erly, we weighed, and &s;ailed from Swallow harbour. At noon we took the Swallow in tow, but at five there being little wind, we ca&s;t off the tow. At eight in the evening, the boats which had been &s;ent out to look for anchorage,
<PB N="402" REF="238">
returned with an account that they could find none: at nine we had fre&s;h gales, and at midnight Cape Upright bore S. S. W &frac12; W.</P>
<P>At &s;even the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> we took the Swallow again in tow, but was again obliged to ca&s;t her off and tack, as the weather became very thick, with a great &s;well, and we &s;aw land clo&s;e under our lee. As no place for anchorage could be found, Captain Carteret advi&s;ed me to bear away for Up|right bay, to which I con&s;ented; and as he was acquainted with the place, he went a-head: the boats were ordered to go between him and the &s;hore, and we followed. At eleven o'clock, there being little wind, we opened a large lagoon, and a current &s;etting &s;trongly into it, the Swallow was driven among the breakers clo&s;e upon the lee &s;hore: to aggravate the misfortune, the weather was very hazey, there was no anchorage, and the &s;urf ran very high. In this dreadful &s;ituation &s;he made &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, and we immediately &s;ent our launch, and other boats, to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance: the boats took her in tow, but their utmo&s;t efforts to &s;ave her would have been ineffectual, if a breeze had not &s;uddenly come down from a mountain, and wafted her off.</P>
<P>As a great &s;well came on about noon, we hauled over to the north &s;hore. We &s;oon found our&s;elves &s;urrounded with i&s;lands, but the fog was &s;o thick, that we knew not where we were, nor which way to &s;teer. Among the&s;e i&s;lands the boats were &s;ent to ca&s;t the lead, but no anchorage was to be found; we then conjectured that we were in the bay of i&s;lands, and that we had no chance to e&s;cape &s;hipwreck, but by hauling directly out: this, however, was no ea&s;y ta&s;k, for I was obliged to tack, almo&s;t continually, to weather &s;ome i&s;land or rock. At four o'clock in the afternoon, it happily cleared up for a minute, ju&s;t to &s;hew us Cape Up|right,
<PB N="403" REF="239">
for which we directly &s;teered, and at half an hour after five anchored, with the Swallow, in the bay. When we dropped the anchor, we were in 24 fathom, and after we had veered away a whole cable, in 46, with a muddy bottom. In this &s;ituation, a high bluff on the north &s;hore bore N. W. &frac12; N. di&s;tant five leagues, and a &s;mall i&s;land within us S. by E. &frac12; E. Soon after we had anchored, the Swallow drove to leeward, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had two anchors a-head, but was at la&s;t brought up, in 70 fathom, about a cable's length a-&s;tern of us. At four o'clock in the morning I &s;ent the boats, with a con&s;iderable number of men, and &s;ome hau&s;ers and anchors, on board her, to weigh her an|chors, and warp her up to windward. When her be&s;t bower anchor was weighed, it was found entangled with the &s;mall one; I therefore found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end the &s;tream cable on board, and the &s;hip was hung up by it. To clear her anchors, and warp her into a proper birth, co&s;t us the whole day, and was not at la&s;t effected without the utmo&s;t difficulty and labour.</P>
<P>On the 18th we had fre&s;h breezes,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 18" UNIT="day"> and &s;ent the boats to &s;ound cro&s;s the Streight. Within half a mile of the &s;hip, they had 40, 45, 50, 70, 100 fathom, and then had no ground, till within a cable's length of the lee &s;hore, where they had 90 fathom. We now moored the &s;hip in 78 fa|thom, with the &s;tream anchor.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> while our people were employed in getting wood and water, and gathering celery and mu&s;cles, two canoes, full of Indians, came along &s;ide of the &s;hip. They had much the &s;ame appearance as the poor wretches whom we had &s;een before in Elizabeth's bay. They had on board &s;ome &s;eal's fle&s;h, blubber, and penguins, all which they cat raw. Some of our people, who were fi&s;hing with a
<PB N="404" REF="240">
hook and line,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> gave one of them a fi&s;h, &s;omewhat bigger than a herring, alive, ju&s;t as it came out of the water. The Indian took it ha&s;tily, as a dog would take a bone, and in&s;tantly killed it, by giving it a bite near the gills: he then pro|ceeded to eat it, beginning with the head, and going on to the tail, without rejecting either the bones, fins, &s;cales, or entrails. They eat every thing that was given them, indif|ferently, whether &s;alt or fre&s;h, dre&s;&s;ed or raw, but would drink nothing but water. They &s;hivered with cold, yet had nothing to cover them but a &s;eal &s;kin, thrown loo&s;ely over their &s;houlders, which, did not reach to their middle; and we ob&s;erved, that when they were rowing, they threw even this by, and &s;at &s;tark naked. They had with them &s;ome ja|velins, rudely pointed with bone, which they u&s;ed to &s;trike &s;eals, fi&s;h, and penguins, and we ob&s;erved that one of them had a piece of iron, about the &s;ize of a common chi&s;&s;el, which was fa&s;tened to a piece of wood, and &s;eemed to be in|tended rather for a tool than a weapon. They had all &s;ore eyes, which we imputed to their &s;itting over the &s;moke of their fires, and they &s;melt more offen&s;ively than a fox, which perhaps was in part owing to their diet, and in part to their na&s;tine&s;s. Their canoes were about fifteen foot long, three broad, and nearly three deep: they were made of the bark of trees, &s;ewn together, either with the &s;inews of &s;ome bea&s;t, or thongs cut out of a hide. Some kind of ru&s;h was laid into the &s;eams, and the out&s;ide was &s;meared with a re&s;in, or gum, which prevented the water from &s;oaking into the bark. Fifteen &s;lender branches, bent into an arch, were fewed tran&s;ver&s;ely to the bottom and &s;ides, and &s;ome &s;trait pieces were placed cro&s;s the top, from gunwale to gunwale, and &s;ecurely la&s;hed at each end: upon the whole, however, it was poorly made, nor had the&s;e people any thing among them in which there was the lea&s;t appearance of ingenuity.
<PB N="405" REF="241">
I gave them a hatchet or two, with &s;ome beads,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> and a few other toys, with which they went away to the &s;outhward, and we &s;aw no more of them.</P>
<P>While we lay here, we &s;ent out the boats, as u&s;ual, in &s;earch of anchoring places, and having been 10 leagues to the we&s;tward, they found but two: one was to the we&s;tward of Cape Upright, in the Bay of I&s;lands, but was very diffi|cult to enter and get out of; the other was called Dolphin bay, at 10 leagues di&s;tance, which was a good harbour, with even ground in all parts. They &s;aw &s;everal &s;mall coves, which were all dangerous, as in them it would be nece&s;&s;ary to let go the anchor within half a cable's length of a lee &s;hore, and &s;teady the &s;hip with hal&s;ers fa&s;tened to the rocks. The people belonging to one of the boats, &s;pent a night upon an i&s;land, upon which, while they were there, &s;ix canoes landed about thirty Indians. The Indians ran immediately to the boat, and were carrying away every thing they found in her: out people di&s;covered what they were doing, ju&s;t time enough to prevent them. As &s;oon as they found them|&s;elves oppo&s;ed, they went to their canoes, and armed them|&s;elves with long poles, and javelins pointed with the bones of fi&s;h. They did not begin an attack, but &s;tood in a threatening manner: our people, who were two and twenty in number, acted only on the defen&s;ive, and by parting with a few trifles to them, they became friends, and behaved peaceably the re&s;t of the time they &s;taid.</P>
<P>For many days, we had hail, lightning, rain, and hard gales, with a heavy &s;ea, &s;o that we thought it impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;hip to hold, though &s;he had two anchors a-head, and two cables an end. The men, however, were &s;ent fre|quently on &s;hore for exerci&s;e, which contributed greatly to
<PB N="406" REF="242">
their health, and procured an almo&s;t con&s;tant &s;upply of mu&s;cles and greens. Among other damages that we had &s;u&s;tained, our fire-place was broken to pieces, we therefore found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et up the forge, and employ the ar|mourers to make a new back; we al&s;o made lime of burnt &s;hells, and once more put it into a u&s;eful condition.</P>
<P>On Monday the 30th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 30" UNIT="day"> we had the fir&s;t interval of moderate weather, and we improved it in drying the &s;ails, which, though much mildewed, we had not before been able to loo&s;e, for fear of &s;etting the &s;hip adrift: we al&s;o aired the &s;pare &s;ails, which we found much injured by the rats, and employed the &s;ail-makers to mend them. Captain Carteret having repre&s;ented that his fire-place, as well as ours, had been broken to pieces, our armourers made him al&s;o a new back, and &s;et it up with lime that we made upon the &s;pot, in the &s;ame manner as had been done on board our own &s;hip. This day we &s;aw &s;everal canoes, full of Indians, put to &s;hore on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 31" UNIT="day"> and the next morning &s;everal of them came on board, and proved to be the &s;ame that our people, who were out in the boat, had met with on &s;hore. They behaved very peaceably, and we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with a few toys, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The day following,<MILESTONE N="April" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 1" UNIT="day"> &s;everal other Indians came off to the &s;hip, and brought with them &s;ome of the birds called Race-Hor&s;es. Our people purcha&s;ed the birds for a few trifles, and I made them a pre&s;ent of &s;everal hatchets and knives.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, the &s;econd of April,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 2" UNIT="day"> the ma&s;ter of the Swal|low, who had been &s;ent out to &s;eek for anchoring places, returned, and reported that he had found three on the north &s;hore, which were very good; one about four miles to the ea&s;tward of Cape Providence, another under the ea&s;t &s;ide of
<PB N="407" REF="243">
Cape Tamer,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 2" UNIT="day"> and the third about four miles to the ea&s;tward of it; but he &s;aid that he found no place to anchor in under Cape Providence, the ground being rocky.</P>
<P>This day two canoes came on board, with four men and three young children in each. The men were &s;omewhat more decently dre&s;&s;ed than tho&s;e that we had &s;een before, but the children were &s;tark naked. They were &s;omewhat fairer than the men, who &s;eemed to pay a very tender atten|tion to them, e&s;pecially in lifting them in and out of the ca|noes. To the&s;e young vi&s;itors I gave necklaces and bracelets, with which they &s;eemed mightily plea&s;ed. It happened that while &s;ome of the&s;e people were on board, and the re&s;t waiting in their canoes by the &s;hip's &s;ide, the boat was &s;ent on &s;hore for wood and water. The Indians who were in the canoes, kept their eyes fixed upon the boat while &s;he was manning, and the moment &s;he put off from the &s;hip, they called out with great vociferation to tho&s;e that were on board, who &s;eemed to be much alarmed, and ha&s;tily hand|ing down the children, leaped into their canoes, without uttering a word. None of us could gue&s;s at the cau&s;e of this &s;udden emotion, but we &s;aw the men in the canoes pull after the boat with all their might, hallooing and &s;houting with great appearance of perturbation and di&s;tre&s;s. The boat outrowed them, and when &s;he came near the &s;hore, the people on board di&s;covered &s;ome women gathering mu&s;cles among the rocks. This at once explained the my|&s;tery; the poor Indians were afraid that the &s;trangers, either by force or favour, &s;hould violate the prerogative of a hu&s;|band, of which they &s;eemed to be more jealous than the na|tives of &s;ome other countries, who in their appearance are le&s;s &s;avage and &s;ordid. Our people, to make them ea&s;y, immediately lay upon their oars, and &s;uffered the canoes to pa&s;s them. The Indians, however, &s;till continued to call
<PB N="408" REF="244">
out to their women, till they took the alarm and ran out of &s;ight, and as &s;oon as they got to land, drew their canoes upon the beach, and followed them with the utmo&s;t expe|dition.</P>
<P>We continued daily to gather mu&s;cles till the 5th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 5" UNIT="day"> when &s;everal of the people being &s;eized with fluxes, the &s;urgeon de&s;ired that no more mu&s;cles might be brought into the &s;hip.</P>
<P>The weather being &s;till tempe&s;tuous and un&s;ettled, we re|mained at anchor till 10 o'clock in the morning of Friday the 10th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 10" UNIT="day"> and then, in company with the Swallow, we made &s;ail. At noon, Cape Providence bore N. N. W. di&s;tant four or five miles; at four in the afternoon Cape Tamer bore N. W. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant three leagues, Cape Upright E. S. E. &frac12; S. di&s;tant three leagues, and Cape Pillar W. di&s;tant 10 leagues. We &s;teered about W. &frac12; N. all night, and at &s;ix o'clock in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 11" UNIT="day"> had run eight and thirty miles by the log. At this time Cape Pillar bore S. W. di&s;tant half a mile, and the Swallow was about three miles a-&s;tern of us. At this time there being but little wind, we were obliged to make all the &s;ail we could, to get without the Streight's mouth. At 11 o'clock I would have &s;hortened &s;ail for the Swallow, but it was not in my power, for as a current &s;et us &s;trongly down upon the I&s;les of Direction, and the wind came to the we&s;t, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me to carry &s;ail, that I might clear them. Soon after we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Swallow, and never &s;aw her afterwards. At fir&s;t I was inclined to have gone back into the Streight, but a fog coming on, and the &s;ea ri&s;ing very fa&s;t, we were all of opi|nion that it was indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to get an o&s;&s;ing as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; for except we pre&s;&s;ed the &s;hip with &s;ail, be|fore the &s;ea ro&s;e too high, it would be impracticable either to weather Terra del Fuego on one tack, or Cape Victory on
<PB N="409" REF="245">
the other. At noon,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 11" UNIT="day"> the I&s;lands of Direction bore N. 21&prime; W. di&s;tant three leagues, Saint Paul's cupola and Cape Victory in one, N. di&s;tant &s;even leagues, and Cape Pillar E. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues.</P>
<P>Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 52&deg; 38&prime; and we com|puted our longitude to be 76&deg; W.</P>
<P>Thus we quitted a dreary and inho&s;pitable region, where we were in almo&s;t perpetual danger of &s;hipwreck for near four months, having entered the Streight on the 17th of De|cember 1766, and quitted it on the 11th of April 1767; a region where, in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, the weather was cold, gloomy, and tempe&s;tuous, where the pro&s;pects had more the appearance of a chaos than of Nature, and where, for the mo&s;t part, the vallies were without herbage, and the hills without wood.</P>

<P N="2">II. POSSESSION BAY. In &s;ailing into this bay, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give the point a good birth, becau&s;e there is a reef
<PB N="411" REF="247">
that runs right off it about a &s;hort mile. The &s;oundings are very irregular all over the bay, but the ground is every where a fine &s;oft mud and clay, &s;o that the cables can come to no damage. The Point lies in latitude 52&deg; 23&prime; S. longitude, by account, 68&deg; 57&prime; W.: the variation is two points ea&s;terly. In the bay the tide ri&s;es and falls between four and five fa|thom, and runs at the rate of about a mile an hour; in the mid-channel without the bay, it runs nearly three miles an hour. In this place we &s;aw no appearance either of wood or water. The landing appeared to be good, but we did not go on &s;hore. We anchored here on the 19th of December, and &s;ailed again on the 22d.</P>
<P N="3">III. PORT FAMINE. At this place, the Spaniards, in the year 1581, built a town, which they called Phillippeville, and left in it a colony, con&s;i&s;ting of 400 per&s;ons. When our celebrated navigator, Cavendi&s;h, arrived here in 1587, he found one of the&s;e unhappy wretches, the only one that re|mained, upon the beach: they had all peri&s;hed for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, except twenty-four; twenty-three of the&s;e &s;et out for the river Plata, and were never afterwards heard of. This man, who&s;e name was Hernando, was brought to England by Cavendi&s;h, who called the place where he had taken him up, Port Famine. It is a very fine bay, in which there is room and conveniency for many &s;hips to moor in great &s;afety. We moored in nine fathom, having brought Cape St. Anne N. E. by E. and Sedger River S. &frac12; W. which perhaps is the be&s;t &s;ituation, though the whole bay is good ground. In this place there is very good wooding and watering; we caught many fine &s;mall fi&s;h with a hook and line off the &s;hip's &s;ide, and hauled the &s;eine with great &s;ucce&s;s, in a fine &s;andy bay, a little to the &s;outhward of Sedger River: we al&s;o &s;hot a great number of birds, of various kinds, particularly gee&s;e, ducks, teal, &s;nipes, plover, and race-hor&s;es, and we
<PB N="412" REF="248">
found wild celery in great plenty. The latitude of this place is 53&deg; 42&prime; S. longitude, by ob&s;ervation, 71&deg; 28&prime; W.; the vari|ation is two points ea&s;terly. We anchored here the 27th of December 1766, and &s;ailed again the 18th of January 1767.</P>
<P N="4">IV. CAPE HOLLAND BAY. There is no danger in &s;ailing into this bay, and there is good anchoring ground in every part of it. We lay at about three cables' length from the &s;hore, in 10 fathom, the ground coar&s;e &s;and and &s;hells, Cape Holland bearing W. S. W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant three miles, Cape Froward a little to the N. of the E. Right a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip there was a very fine rivulet, and clo&s;e under Cape Holland a large river, navigable for boats many miles: the &s;hore al&s;o affords fire wood in great plenty. We found abundance of wild celery and cranberries, mu&s;cles and lim|pets, but caught very little fi&s;h, either with hook and line, or the &s;eine. We killed &s;ome gee&s;e, ducks, teal, and race-hor&s;es, but they were not plenty. This bay lies in latitude 53&deg; 57&prime; S. longitude, by account, 72&deg; 34&prime; W.; the variation is two points ea&s;terly. The water ro&s;e about eight feet; we found, however, no regular tide, but for the mo&s;t part a &s;trong current &s;etting to the ea&s;tward. We anchored here on the 19th of January, and &s;ailed again on the 23d.</P>
<P N="5">V. CAPE GALLLANT BAY. In this bay, which may be entered with great &s;afety, there is a fine large lagoon, where a fleet of &s;hips may moor in perfect &s;ecurity. There is a depth of four fathom in every part of it, with a &s;oft muddy ground. In the bay, the be&s;t anchoring is on the ea&s;t &s;ide, where there is from &s;ix to ten fathom. Here is good watering from two rivers, and plenty of wood. The lagoon abounded with wild fowl, and we found wild celery, mu&s;cles, and limpets in plenty. We did not haul the &s;eine, having torn one to pieces, and the other being unpacked,
<PB N="413" REF="249">
but if we had, there is rea&s;on to believe that we &s;hould have been well &s;upplied with fi&s;h. The landing is good. The latitude of the bay and lagoon is 53&deg; 50&prime; S. longitude, by ac|count, 73&deg; 9&prime; W.; the variation is two points ea&s;terly. I ob|&s;erved the water to ri&s;e and fall about nine feet, but the tide was very irregular. We anchored here the 23d of January, and &s;ailed again the 28th.</P>
<P N="6">VI. ELIZABETH's BAY. At the entrance of this bay there are two &s;mall reefs, which appear above water. The mo&s;t dangerous lies off the ea&s;t point of the bay, but this may ea&s;ily be avoided, by keeping at the di&s;tance of about two cables' length from the point. There is good landing all round the bay, but it is much expo&s;ed to the we&s;terly winds. The be&s;t place for anchoring is Pa&s;&s;age Point, at half a mile di&s;tance, bearing S. E. and the river bearing N. E. by E. di&s;tant three cables' length; in this &s;ituation, a bank or &s;hoal, which may be known by the weeds, bears W. N. W. di&s;tant a cable's length: the ground is coar&s;e &s;and, with &s;hells. Sufficient wood is to be procured here for the u&s;e of &s;hips, and there is good watering at a &s;mall river. We found a little celery and a few cranberries, but neither fi&s;h nor fowl. The latitude of this place is 53&deg; 43&prime; S. the longi|tude, by account, 73&deg; 24&prime; W.; the variation is two points ea&s;terly. We anchored here the 29th of January, and &s;ailed the 4th of February.</P>
<P N="7">VII. YORK ROAD. The only danger of &s;ailing into the bay, that is formed by two points in this road, ari&s;es from a reef that runs off to about a cable's length from the we&s;tern point, which once known, may be ea&s;ily avoided. To an|chor in this bay, it is &s;afe&s;t to bring York Point E. S. E. Ba|chelor's River N. by W. &frac12; W. the we&s;t point of the bay or reef N. W. &frac12; W. and St. Jerom's Sound W. N. W. at the di&s;tance of
<PB N="414" REF="250">
half a mile from the &s;hore. There is good watering about a mile up Bachelor's River, and good wooding all round the bay, where the landing al&s;o is, in all parts, very good. We found plenty of celery, cranberries, mu&s;cles, and limpets, many wild fowl, and &s;ome fi&s;h, but not enough to &s;upply the &s;hip's company with a fre&s;h meal. The latitude here is 53&deg; 39&prime; S. longitude, by account, 73&deg; 52&prime; W.; the variation two points ea&s;terly. The water ri&s;es and falls about eight feet, but the tide is irregular. The ma&s;ter, who cro&s;&s;ed the Streight many times to examine the bays, frequently found the current &s;etting in three different directions. We anchored here on the 4th of February, and &s;ailed again the 11th.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. BUTLER's BAY. This is a &s;mall bay, intirely &s;ur|rounded by rocks, &s;o that no &s;hip &s;hould anchor here if &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it. We found, however, &s;ufficient wood and water to keep up our &s;tock, mu&s;cles and limpets in plenty, &s;ome good rock-fi&s;h, and a few wild fowl, but celery and cranberries were very &s;carce. This bay lies in latitude 53&deg; 37&prime; S. longitude, by account, 74&deg; 9&prime; W.; the variation is two points ea&s;terly. The water ri&s;es and falls here about four feet, but the current always &s;ets to the ea&s;tward. We an|chored here the 18th of February, and &s;ailed the 1&s;t of March.</P>
<P N="9">IX. LION COVE. This is a &s;mall bay, and &s;urrounded by rocks. The water is deep, but the ground is good. It is not a bad place for one &s;hip, nor a good one for two. Here is good watering up a &s;mall creek, but no wood. There is good landing at the watering-place, but no where el&s;e. We found no refre&s;hment but a few mu&s;cles, limpets, and rock-fi&s;h, with a little celery. The latitude is 35&deg; 26&prime; S. longitude, by account, 74&deg; 25&prime; W.; the variation was two points ea&s;terly. The water, as far as we could judge by the appearance of
<PB N="415" REF="251">
the rocks, ri&s;es and falls about five feet, and the current &s;ets at the rate of about two knots an hour. We anchored here on the 2d of March, and &s;ailed the next day.</P>
<P N="10">X. GOOD-LUCK BAY. This is a &s;mall bay, and like &s;everal others in this Streight, intirely &s;urrounded by rocks. The ground is very coar&s;e, and the cable of our be&s;t bower anchor was &s;o much rubbed, that we were obliged to con|demn it, and bend a new one. At this place there is a little wood, and plenty of good water, but the rocks render it very difficult of acce&s;s. No man that &s;ees this part of the coa&s;t, can expect to find any kind of refre&s;hment upon it; and indeed we caught nothing except a few rock-fi&s;h, with hook and line. There may be circum&s;tances in which it may be good luck to get into this bay, but we thought it very good luck to get out of it. It lies in latitude 53&deg; 23&prime; S. lon|gitude, by account, 74&deg; 33&prime; W.; the variation is two points ea&s;terly. The water ri&s;es and falls between three and four feet, though whenever we had an opportunity of trying the current, we found it run ea&s;terly. We anchored here the 3d of March, and &s;ailed the 15th.</P>
<P N="11">XI. SWALLOW HARBOUR. This harbour, when once entered, is very &s;afe, being &s;heltered from all winds, but the entrance is narrow and rocky; the rocks, however, may be ea&s;ily avoided by keeping a good look-out, as there are large bunches of rock-weed upon them all. We found here a &s;ufficient &s;upply of wood and water, the wood however was very &s;mall. As the water is con&s;tantly &s;mooth here, the landing is every where good; but we found no &s;upply of provi&s;ions, except a few mu&s;cles and rock-fi&s;h. The moun|tains round it have the mo&s;t horrid appearance, and &s;eem to be altogether de&s;erted by every thing that has life. The la|titude is 53&deg; 29&prime; S. the longitude, by account, 74&deg; 35&prime; W.; the
<PB N="416" REF="252">
variation is two points ea&s;terly, and the tide ri&s;es and falls between four and five feet. We anchored here the 15th of March, and left the place the next day.</P>
<P N="12">XII. UPRIGHT BAY. This bay may be &s;afely entered, as there is no ob&s;truction but what is above water. The wood here is very &s;mall, but we found &s;ufficient to keep up our &s;tock. The water is excellent, and in great plenty. As to provi&s;ions, we got only a few wild fowl, rock-fi&s;hes, and mu&s;cles. The landing is bad. The latitude of this place, is 53&deg; 8&prime; S. longitude 75&deg; 35&prime; W.; the variation two points ea&s;t|erly. The water ri&s;es and falls about five feet, but the tide or current is very irregular. We anchored here on the 18th of March, and &s;ailed again on the 10th of April.</P>
<P>There are three very good bays a little beyond Cape Shut-up, which we called RIVER BAY, LODGING BAY, and WAL|LIS's BAY. Wallis's bay is the be&s;t.</P>
<P>About half way between Elizabeth's bay and York road, lies Mu&s;cle bay, where there is very good anchorage with a we&s;terly wind. There is al&s;o a bay, with good anchorage, oppo&s;ite to York road, and another to the ea&s;tward of Cape Cro&s;s-tide, but this will hold only a &s;ingle &s;hip. Between Cape Cro&s;s and Saint David's Head, lies Saint David's Sound, on the &s;outh &s;ide of which we found a bank of coar&s;e &s;and and &s;hells, with a depth of water from 19 to 30 fathom, where a &s;hip might anchor in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; and the Ma&s;ter of the Swallow found a very good &s;mall bay a little to the ea&s;tward of Saint David's Head. A little to the ea&s;tward of Cape Quod, lies I&s;land bay, where the Swallow lay &s;ome time, but it is by no means an eligible &s;ituation. The ground of Chance bay is very rocky and uneven, and for that rea&s;on &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="253">As all the violent gales by which we &s;uffered in this navi|gation, blew from the we&s;tward, it is proper to &s;tand about a hundred leagues or more to the we&s;tward, after &s;ailing out of the Streight, that the &s;hip may not be endangered on a lee &s;hore, which at pre&s;ent is wholly unknown.</P>

<P>AS we continued our cour&s;e to the we&s;tward,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 12" UNIT="day"> after having cleared the Streight, we &s;aw a great number of gannets, &s;heerwaters, pintado birds, and many others, about the &s;hip, and had for the mo&s;t part &s;trong gales, hazy weather and heavy &s;eas, &s;o that we were frequently brought under our cour&s;es, and there was not a dry place in the &s;hip for &s;ome weeks together.</P>
<P>At eight in the morning of the 22d,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 22" UNIT="day"> we had an ob&s;erva|tion, by which we found our longitude to be 95&deg; 46&prime; W. and at noon, our latitude was 42&deg; 24&prime; S. and the variation, by azimuth, 11&deg; 6&prime; E.</P>

Our latitude, on the 27th at noon, was 36&deg; 54&prime; S. our longitude, by account, 100&deg; W. This day, the weather being moderate and fair, we dried all the people's cloaths, and got the &s;ick upon deck, to whom we gave &s;alop,

<P>The hard gales, with frequent and violent &s;qualls, and a heavy &s;ea, &s;oon returned, and continued with very little in|termi&s;&s;ion. The &s;hip pitched &s;o much, that we were afraid &s;he would carry away her ma&s;ts, and the men were again wet in their beds.</P>

They had vinegar and mu&s;tard without limitation, wine in&s;tead of &s;pirits, &s;weet wort and &s;alop. Portable &s;oup was &s;till con&s;tantly boiled in their peas and oatmeal; their birth and cloaths were kept perfectly clean; the hammocks were con&s;tantly brought upon the deck at eight o'clock in the morning, and carried down at four in the afternoon.

N. W." At noon it was &s;een plainly from the deck, and found to be a low i&s;land, at about five or &s;ix leagues di&s;tance. The joy which every one on board felt at this di&s;covery, can be con|ceived by tho&s;e only who have experienced the danger, &s;ick|ne&s;s, and fatigue of &s;uch a voyage as we had performed.</P>
<P>When we were within about five miles of this i&s;land, we &s;aw another, bearing N. W. by W. About three o'clock in the afternoon, being very near the i&s;land that was fir&s;t di&s;|covered, we brought to, and I &s;ent Mr. Faurneaux, my &s;econd lieutenant, my fir&s;t lieutenant being very ill, with the boats manned and armed, to the &s;hore. As he approached it, we &s;aw two canoes put off, and paddle away with great expe|dition towards the i&s;land that lay to leeward. At &s;even in the evening the boats returned, and brought with them &s;everal cocoa nuts, and a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;curvy-gra&s;s; they brought al&s;o &s;ome fi&s;h hooks, that were made of oy&s;ter-&s;hells, and &s;ome of the &s;hells of which they were made. They reported that they had &s;een none of the inha|bitants, but had vi&s;ited three huts, or rather &s;heds, con&s;i&s;t|ing only of a roof, neatly thatched with cocoa nut and palm leaves, &s;upported upon po&s;ts, and open all round. They &s;aw al&s;o &s;everal canoes building, but found no fre&s;h water, nor any fruit but cocoa nuts. They &s;ounded, but found no an|chorage, and it was with great difficulty that they got on &s;hore, as the &s;urf ran very high. Having received this ac|count, I &s;tood off and on all night,<MILESTONE N="Whit&s;unday 7" UNIT="day"> and early the next morn|ing I &s;ent the boats out again to &s;ound, with orders, if po&s;&s;ible, to find a place where the &s;hip might come to an
<PB N="424" REF="260">
anchor; <MILESTONE N="Whit&s;unday 7" UNIT="day"> but at 11 o'clock they returned, with no better &s;uc|ce&s;s than before. The people told me that the whole i&s;land was &s;urrounded by a reef, and that although on the weather &s;ide of the i&s;land there was an opening through it, into a large ba&s;on, that extended to the middle of the i&s;land, yet they found it &s;o full of breakers, that they could not venture in; neither indeed had they been able to land on any part of the i&s;land, the &s;urf running &s;till higher than it had done the day before. As it would therefore an&s;wer no purpo&s;e to con|tinue here, I hoi&s;ted the boats in, and &s;tood away for the other i&s;land, which bore S. 22&deg; E. di&s;tant about four leagues. The i&s;land which I now quitted, having been di&s;covered on Whit&s;un-eve, I called it WHITSUN ISLAND.<MILESTONE N="Whit&s;un-i&s;land" UNIT="place"> It is about four miles long, and three wide. Its latitude is 19&deg; 26&prime; S. and its longitude, by ob&s;ervation, 137&deg; 56&prime; W.</P>
<P>When we came under the lee of the other i&s;land, I &s;ent Lieutenant Furneaux, with the boats manned and armed, to the &s;hore, where I &s;aw about fifty of the natives armed with long pikes, and &s;everal of them running about with fire|brands in their hands. I ordered Mr. Furneaux to go to that part of the beach where we &s;aw the people, and endeavour to traffick with them for fruit and water, or whatever el&s;e might be u&s;eful; at the &s;ame time, being particularly careful to give them no offence. I ordered him al&s;o to employ the boats in &s;ounding for anchorage. About &s;even o'clock he returned, and told me that he could find no ground with the line, till he came within half a cable's length of the &s;hore, and that there it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;harp rocks, and lay very deep.</P>
<P>As the boat approached the &s;hore, the Indians thronged down towards the beach, and put them&s;elves upon their guard with their long pikes, as if to di&s;pute the landing. Our men then lay upon their oars, and made &s;igns of friend|&s;hip,
<PB N="425" REF="261">
&s;hewing at the &s;ame time &s;everal &s;trings of beads,<MILESTONE N="Whit&s;unday 7" UNIT="day"> ribands, knives, and other trinkets. The Indians &s;till made &s;igns to out people that they &s;hould depart, but at the &s;ame time eyed the trinkets with a kind of wi&s;hful curio&s;ity. Soon after &s;ome of them advanced a few &s;teps into the &s;ea, and our people making &s;igns that they wanted cocoa nuts and water, &s;ome of them brought down a &s;mall quantity of both, and ventured to hand them into the boat: the water was in cocoa nut-&s;hells, and the fruit was &s;tripped of its out|ward covering, which is probably u&s;ed for various purpo&s;es. For this &s;upply they were paid with the trinkets that had been &s;hewed them, and &s;ome nails, upon which they &s;eemed to &s;et a much greater value. During this traffick, one of the Indians found means to &s;teal a &s;ilk handkerchief, in which &s;ome of our &s;mall merchandize was wrapped up, and carried it clear off, with its contents, &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that no body ob&s;erved him. Our people made &s;igns that a hand|kerchief had been &s;tolen, but they either could not, or would not under&s;tand them. The boat continued about the beach, &s;ounding for anchorage, till it was dark; and having many times endeavoured to per&s;uade the natives to bring down &s;ome &s;curvy-gra&s;s, without &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he returned on board.</P>
<P>I &s;tood off and on with the &s;hip all night,<MILESTONE N="Monday 8" UNIT="day"> and as &s;oon as the day broke, I &s;ent the boats again, with orders to make a landing, but without giving any offence to the natives, that could po&s;&s;ibly be avoided. When our boats came near the &s;hore, the officer was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;even large canoes, with two &s;tout ma&s;ts in each, lying ju&s;t in the &s;urf, with all the inhabitants upon the beach, ready to embark. They made &s;igns to our people to go higher up; they readily complied, and as &s;oon as they went a&s;hore, all the Indians embarked, and &s;ailed away to the we&s;tward, being joined
<PB N="426" REF="262">
by two other canoes at the we&s;t end of the i&s;land.<MILESTONE N="Monday 8" UNIT="day"> About noon, the boats returned, laden with cocoa nuts, palm nuts, and &s;curvy-gra&s;s. Mr. Furneaux, who commanded the ex|pedition, told me that the Indians had left nothing behind them but four or five canoes. He found a well of very good water, and de&s;cribed the i&s;land as being &s;andy and level, full of trees, but without underwood, and abounding with &s;curvy-gra&s;s. The canoes, which &s;teered about W. S. W. as long as they could be &s;een from the ma&s;t-head, appeared to be about thirty feet long, four feet broad, and three and an half deep. Two of the&s;e being brought along &s;ide of each other, were fa&s;tened together, at the di&s;tance of about three feet a&s;under, by cro&s;s beams, pa&s;&s;ing from the larboard gunwale of one, to the &s;tarboard gunwale of the other, in the middle and near to each end.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this i&s;land were of a middle &s;tature, and dark complexion, with long black hair, which hung loo&s;e over their &s;houlders. The men were well made, and the wo|men hand&s;ome. Their cloathing was a kind of coar&s;e cloth or matting, which was fa&s;tened about their middle, and &s;eemed capable of being brought up round their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, I &s;ent Lieutenant Furneaux with the boats again on &s;hore. He had with him a mate and twenty men, who were to make a rolling way for getting the ca&s;ks down to the beach from the well. I gave orders that he &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, in the name of King George the Third, and give it the name of QUEEN CHAR|LOTTE's ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Queen Char|lotte's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of her Maje&s;ty. The boats re|turned freighted with cocoa nuts and &s;curvy-gra&s;s, and the officer told me that he had found two more wells of good water, not far from the beach. I was at this time very ill, yet I went a&s;hore with the Surgeon, and &s;everal of the people,
<PB N="427" REF="263">
who were enfeebled by the &s;curvy, to take a walk.<MILESTONE N="Monday 8" UNIT="day"> I found the wells &s;o convenient, that I left the mate and twenty men on &s;hore to fill water, and ordered a week's provi&s;ions to be &s;ent them from the &s;hip, they being already furni&s;hed with arms and ammunition. In the evening I returned on board, with the Surgeon and the &s;ick, leaving only the waterers on &s;hore. As we had not been able to find any anchorage, I &s;tood off and on all night.</P>
<P>In the morning,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 9" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent all the empty water ca&s;ks on &s;hore: the Surgeon and the &s;ick were al&s;o &s;ent for the benefit of another airing, but I gave them &s;trict orders that they &s;hould keep near the water-&s;ide, and in the &s;hade; that they &s;hould not pull down or injure any of the hou&s;es, nor, for the &s;ake of the fruit, de&s;troy the cocoa trees, which I ap|pointed proper per&s;ons to climb. At noon, the rolling-way being made, the cutter returned laden with water, but it was with great difficulty got off the beach, as it is all rock, and the &s;urf that breaks upon it, is often very great. At four, I received another boat-load of water, and a fre&s;h &s;upply of cocoa nuts, palm nuts, and &s;curvy-gra&s;s; the Sur|geon al&s;o returned with the &s;ick men, who received much benefit from their walk. The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 10" UNIT="day"> as &s;oon as it was light, I di&s;patched orders to the mate, to &s;end all the water that was filled on board, and to be ready to come off with his people when the boats &s;hould return again, bring|ing with them as many cocoa nuts, and as much &s;curvy-gra&s;s as they could procure. About eight o'clock, all the boats and people came on board, with the water and refre&s;h|ments, but the cutter, in coming off, &s;hipped a &s;ea, which almo&s;t filled her with water: the barge was happily near enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, by taking great part of her crew on board, while the re&s;t freed her, without any other damage than the lo&s;s of the cocoa nuts, and greens that were on
<PB N="428" REF="264">
board.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 10" UNIT="day"> At noon, I hoi&s;ted the boats in, and there being a great &s;ea, with a dreadful &s;urf rolling in upon the &s;hore, and no anchorage, I thought it prudent to leave this place, with &s;uch refre&s;hments as we had got. The people who had re&s;ided on &s;hore, &s;aw no appearance of metal of any kind, but &s;everal tools, which were made of &s;hells and &s;tones, &s;harpened and fitted into handles, like adzes, chi&s;&s;els, and awls. They &s;aw &s;everal canoes building, which are formed of planks, &s;ewed together, and fa&s;tened to &s;everal &s;mall timbers, that pa&s;s tran&s;ver&s;ely along the bottom and up the &s;ides. They &s;aw &s;everal repo&s;itories of the dead, in which the body was left to putrefy under a canopy, and not put into the ground.</P>
<P>When we &s;ailed, we left a union jack flying upon the i&s;land, with the &s;hip's name, the time of our being here, and an account of our taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, and Whit&s;un I&s;land, in the name of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, cut on a piece of wood, and in the bark of &s;everal trees. We al&s;o left &s;ome hatchets, nails, gla&s;s bottles, beads, &s;hillings, &s;ix|pences, and halfpence, as pre&s;ents to the natives, and an atonement for the di&s;turbance we had given them. Queen Charlotte's I&s;land is about &s;ix miles long, and one mile wide, lies in latitude 19&deg; 18&prime; S. longitude, by ob&s;ervation, 138&deg; 4&prime; W. and we found the variation here to be 4&deg; 46&prime; E.</P>
<P>We made &s;ail with a fine breeze, and about one o'clock, &s;aw an i&s;land W. by S. Queen Charlotte's I&s;land, at this time bearing E. by N. di&s;tant 15 miles. At half an hour after three, we were within about three quarters of a mile of the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, and ran clo&s;e along the &s;hore, but had no &s;oundings. The ea&s;t and we&s;t ends are joined to each other by a reef of rocks, over which the &s;ea breaks into a lagoon, in the middle of the i&s;land, which, therefore, had
<PB N="429" REF="265">
the appearance of two i&s;lands,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 10" UNIT="day"> and &s;eemed to be about &s;ix miles long, and four broad. The whole of it is low land, full of trees, but we &s;aw not a &s;ingle cocoa nut, nor any huts: we found, however, at the we&s;termo&s;t end, all the canoes and people who had fled, at our approach, from Queen Charlotte's I&s;land, and &s;ome more. We counted eight double canoes, and about, four&s;core people, men, women, and children. The canoes were drawn upon the beach, the women and children were placed near them, and the men advanced with their pikes and firebrands, making a great noi&s;e, and dancing in a &s;trange manner. We ob&s;erved that this i&s;land was &s;andy, and that under the trees there was no verdure. As the &s;hore was every where rocky, as there was no anchorage, and as we had no pro&s;pect of obtaining any refre&s;hment here, I &s;et &s;ail at &s;ix o'clock in the evening, from this i&s;land, to which I gave the name of EGMONT ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Egmont I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of the Earl of Egmont, who was then fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty. It lies in latitude 19&deg; 20&prime; S. lon|gitude, by ob&s;ervation, 138&deg; 30&prime; W.</P>
<P>At one o'clock, on the 11th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw an i&s;land in the W. S. W. and &s;tood for it. At four in the afternoon, we were within a quarter of a mile of the &s;hore, and ran along it, &s;ounding continually, but could get no ground. It is &s;ur|rounded on every &s;ide by rocks, on which the &s;ea breaks very high. It is full of trees, but not one cocoa nut, and has much the &s;ame appearance with Egmont i&s;land, but is much narrower. Among the rocks, at the we&s;t end, we &s;aw about &s;ixteen of the natives, but no canoes: they carried long pikes or poles in their hands, and &s;eemed to be, in every re&s;pect, the &s;ame kind of people that we had &s;een before. As nothing was to be had here, and it blew very hard, I made &s;ail till eight in the evening, and then brought to. To this i&s;land, which is about &s;ix miles long, and from
<PB N="430" REF="266">
one mile to one quarter of a mile broad, I gave the name of GLOUCESTER ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Glouce&s;ter I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke. It lies in latitude 19&deg; 11&prime; S. and longitude, by ob&s;er|vation, 140&deg; 4&prime; W.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Friday 12" UNIT="day"> we made &s;ail, and &s;oon after &s;aw another i&s;land. At 10 o'clock, the weather being tempe&s;tuous, with much rain, we &s;aw a long reef, with breakers on each &s;ide of the i&s;land, and therefore brought the &s;hip to, with her head off the &s;hore. To this i&s;land, which lies in latitude 19&deg; 18&prime; S. longitude, by ob&s;ervation, 140&deg; 36&prime; W. I gave the name of CUMBERLAND ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Cumberland I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke. It lies low, and is about the &s;ame &s;ize as Queen Charlotte's I&s;land. We found the variation of the needle here to be 7&deg; 10&prime; E. As I had no hope of finding any refre&s;hment here, I &s;tood on to the we&s;t|ward.</P>
<P>At day-break, on Saturday the 13th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 13" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw another &s;mall low i&s;land, in the N. N. W. right to windward. It had the appearance of &s;mall flat keys. This place I called PRINCE WILLIAM HENRY's ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Prince Wil|liam Henry's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of his Maje&s;ty's third &s;on. It lies in latitude 19&deg; S. longitude, by ob&s;ervation, 141&deg; 6&prime; W. I made no &s;tay here, hoping, that to the we&s;t|ward I &s;hould find higher land, where the &s;hip might come to an anchor, and &s;uch refre&s;hments as we wanted be pro|cured.</P>
<P>Soon after day-light, on the 17th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw land bearing W. by N. and making in a &s;mall round hummock. At noon, when it bore N. 64. W. di&s;tant about five leagues, its appearance greatly re&s;embled the Mew&s;tone in Plymouth Sound, but it &s;eemed to be much larger. We found the &s;hip this day, 20 miles to the northward of her reckoning, which I imputed to a great S. W. &s;well.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="267">At five in the evening,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 17" UNIT="day"> this i&s;land bore N. W. di&s;tant about eight miles. I then hauled the wind, and &s;tood on and off all night. At ten, we &s;aw a light upon the &s;hore, which, though the i&s;land was &s;mall, proved that it was in|habited, and gave us hopes that we &s;hould find anchorage near it. We ob&s;erved with great plea&s;ure, that the land was very high, and covered with cocoa trees; a &s;ure &s;ign that there was water.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 18" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent Lieutenant Furneaux to the &s;hore, with the boats manned and armed, and all kinds of trinkets, to e&s;tabli&s;h a traffick with the natives, for &s;uch re|fre&s;hment as the place would afford. I gave him orders al&s;o to find, if po&s;&s;ible, an anchoring place for the &s;hip. While we were getting out the boats, &s;everal canoes put off from the i&s;land, but as &s;oon as the people on board &s;aw them make towards the &s;hore, they put back. At noon, the boats re|turned, and brought with them a pig and a cock, with a few plantains and cocoa nuts. Mr. Furneaux reported, that he had &s;een at lea&s;t an hundred of the inhabitants, and believed there were many more upon the i&s;land; but that having been all round it, he could find no anchorage, nor &s;carcely a landing-place for the boat. When he reached the &s;hore, he came to a grapling, and threw a warp to the Indians upon the beach, who caught it and held it fa&s;t. He then began to conver&s;e with them by &s;igns, and ob&s;erved that they had no weapon among them, but that &s;ome of them had white &s;ticks, which &s;eemed to be en&s;igns of authority, as the people who bore them kept the re&s;t of the natives back. In return for the pig and the cock, he gave them &s;ome beads, a looking-gla&s;s, a few combs, with &s;everal other trinkets, and a hatchet. The women, who had been kept at a di&s;tance, as &s;oon as they &s;aw the trinkets, ran down in a croud to the beach, with great eagerne&s;s, but were &s;oon driven away by
<PB N="432" REF="268">
the men,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 18" UNIT="day"> at which they expre&s;&s;ed much di&s;appointment and vexation. While this traffick was carrying on, a man came &s;ecretly round a rock, and diving down, took up the boat's grappling, and at the &s;ame time, the people on &s;hore who held the warp, made an effort to draw her into the &s;urf. As &s;oon as this was perceived by the people on board, they fixed a mu&s;ket over the man's head who had taken up the grappling, upon which he in&s;tantly let it go, with marks of great terror and a&s;toni&s;hment; the people on &s;hore al&s;o let go the rope. The boats after this, lay &s;ome time upon their oars, but the officer finding that he could get nothing more, returned on board. Mr. Furneaux told me that both the men and women were cloathed, and he brought a piece of their cloth away with him. The inhabitants appeared to him to be more numerous than the i&s;land could &s;upport, and for this rea&s;on, e&s;pecially as he &s;aw &s;ome large double canoes upon the beach, he imagined there were i&s;lands of larger extent, not far di&s;tant, where refre&s;hments in greater plenty might be procured, and hoped that they might be le&s;s difficult of acce&s;s. As I thought this a rea&s;onable conjecture, I hoi&s;ted in the boats, and determined to run farther to the we&s;tward. To this place, which is nearly circular, and about two miles over, I gave the name of OSNABURGH ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="O&s;naburgh I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of Prince Frederick, who is bi&s;hop of that &s;ee. It lies in latitude 17&deg; 51&prime; S. and longitude 147&deg; 30&prime; W.; the variation here was 7&deg; 10&prime; E.</P>

<P>AT two o'clock, the &s;ame day, we bore away,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 18" UNIT="day"> and in about half an hour, di&s;covered very high land in the W. S. W. At &s;even in the evening, O&s;naburgh I&s;land bore E. N. E. and the new di&s;covered land, from W. N. W. to W. by S. As the weather was thick and &s;qually, we brought to for the night, or at lea&s;t till the fog &s;hould break away. At two in the morning, it being very clear, we made &s;ail again; <MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> at day-break we &s;aw the land, at about five leagues di&s;tance, and &s;teered directly for it; but at eight o'clock, when we were clo&s;e under it, the fog obliged us again to lie to, and when it cleared away, we were much &s;urpri&s;ed to find our|&s;elves &s;urrounded by &s;ome hundreds of canoes. They were of different &s;izes, and had on board different numbers, from one to ten, &s;o that in all of them together, there could not be le&s;s than eight hundred people. When they came within pi&s;tol &s;hot of the &s;hip, they lay by, gazing at us with great a&s;toni&s;hment, and by turns conferring with each other. In the mean time we &s;hewed them trinkets of various kinds, and invited them on board. Soon after, they drew together, and held a kind of council, to determine what &s;hould be done: then they all paddled round the &s;hip, making &s;igns of friend&s;hip, and one of them holding up a branch of the plantain tree, made a &s;peech that la&s;ted near a quarter of an
<PB N="434" REF="270">
hour,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> and then threw it into the &s;ea. Soon after, as we continued to make &s;igns of invitation, a fine, &s;tout, lively young man ventured on board: he came up by the mizen chains, and jumped out of the &s;hrouds upon the top of the awning. We made &s;igns to him to come down upon the quarter-deck, and handed up &s;ome trinkets to him: he looked plea&s;ed, but would accept of nothing till &s;ome of the Indians came along &s;ide, and after much talk, threw a few branches of plantain tree on board the &s;hip. He then ac|cepted our pre&s;ents, and &s;everal others very &s;oon came on board, at different parts of the &s;hip, not knowing the proper entrance. As one of the&s;e Indians was &s;tanding near the gang-way, on the larboard &s;ide of the quarter-deck, one of our goats butted him upon the haunches: being &s;urpri&s;ed at the blow, he turned ha&s;tily about, and &s;aw the goat rai&s;ed upon his hind-legs, ready to repeat the blow. The appear|ance of this animal, &s;o different from any he had ever &s;een, &s;truck him with &s;uch terror, that he in&s;tantly leaped over board; and all the re&s;t, upon &s;eeing what had happened, followed his example with the utmo&s;t precipitation: they recovered however, in a &s;hort time, from their fright, and returned on board. After having a little reconciled them to our goats and &s;heep, I &s;hewed them our hogs and poultry, and they immediately made &s;igns that they had &s;uch ani|mals as the&s;e. I then di&s;tributed trinkets and nails among them, and made &s;igns that they &s;hould go on &s;hore and bring us &s;ome of their hogs, fowls and fruit, but they did not &s;eem to under&s;tand my meaning: they were, in the mean time, watching an opportunity to &s;teal &s;ome of the things that happened to lie in their way, but we generally detected them in the attempt. At la&s;t, however, one of the mid&s;hipmen happened to come where they were &s;tanding, with a new laced hat upon his head, and began to talk to
<PB N="435" REF="271">
one of them by &s;igns: while he was thus engaged,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> another of them came behind him, and &s;uddenly &s;natching off the hat, leaped over the taffarel into the &s;ea, and &s;wam away with it.</P>
<P>As we had no anchorage here, we &s;tood along the &s;hore, &s;ending the boats at the &s;ame time to &s;ound at a le&s;s di&s;tance. As none of the&s;e canoes had &s;ails, they could not keep up with us, and therefore &s;oon paddled back towards the &s;hore. The country has the mo&s;t delightful and roman|tic appearance that can be imagined: towards the &s;ea it is level, and is covered with fruit trees of various kinds, par|ticularly the cocoa nut. Among the&s;e are the hou&s;es of the inhabitants, con&s;i&s;ting only of a roof, and at a di&s;tance having greatly the appearance of a long barn. The country within, at about the di&s;tance of three miles, ri&s;es into lofty hills, that are crowned with wood, and terminate in peaks, from which large rivers are precipitated into the &s;ea. We &s;aw no &s;hoals, but found the i&s;land &s;kirted by a reef of rocks, through which there are &s;everal openings into deep water. About three o'clock in the afternoon, we brought to, a-brea&s;t of a large bay, where there was an appearance of anchorage. The boats were immediately &s;ent to &s;ound it, and while they were thus employed, I ob&s;erved a great number of canoes gather round them. I &s;u&s;pected that the Indians had a de&s;ign to attack them, and as I was very de&s;irous to prevent mi&s;chief, I made the &s;ignal for the boats to come aboard, and at the &s;ame time, to intimidate the Indians, I fired a nine pounder over their heads. As &s;oon as the cutter began to &s;tand towards the &s;hip, the Indians in their canoes, though they had been &s;tartled by the thunder of our nine pounder, endeavoured to cut her off. The boat, however, &s;ailing fa&s;ter than the canoes could paddle, &s;oon got clear of tho&s;e that were about her; but &s;ome others, that
<PB N="436" REF="272">
were full of men,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> way-laid her in her cour&s;e, and threw &s;everal &s;tones into her, which wounded &s;ome of the people. Upon this, the officer on board fired a mu&s;quet, loaded with buck-&s;hot, at the man who threw the fir&s;t &s;tone, and wounded him in the &s;houlder. The re&s;t of the people in the canoes, as &s;oon as they perceived their companion wounded, leapt into the &s;ea, and the other canoes paddled away, in great terror and confu&s;ion. As &s;oon as the boats reached the &s;hip, they were hoi&s;ted on board, and ju&s;t as &s;he was about to &s;tand on, we ob&s;erved a large canoe, under &s;ail, making after us. As I thought &s;he might have &s;ome Chief on board, or might have been di&s;patched to bring me a me&s;&s;age from &s;ome Chief, I determined to wait for her. She &s;ailed very fa&s;t, and was &s;oon along &s;ide of the &s;hip, but we did not ob&s;erve among tho&s;e on board, any one that &s;eemed to have an authority over the re&s;t. One of them, however, &s;tood up, and having made a &s;peech, which con|tinued about five minutes, threw on board a branch of the plantain tree. We under&s;tood this to be a token of peace, and we returned it, by handing over one of the branches of plantain that had been left on board by our fir&s;t vi&s;itors: with this and &s;ome toys, that were afterwards pre&s;ented to him, he appeared to be much gratified, and after a &s;hort time, went away.</P>
<P>The officers who had been &s;ent out with the boats, in|formed me that they had &s;ounded clo&s;e to the reef, and found as great a depth of water as at the other i&s;lands: how|ever, as I was now on the weather &s;ide of the i&s;land, I had rea&s;on to expect anchorage in running to leeward. I therefore took this cour&s;e, but finding breakers that ran off to a great di&s;tance from the &s;outh-end of the i&s;land, I hauled the wind, and continued turning to windward all night, in order to run down on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="437" REF="273">At five o'clock in the morning, we made &s;ail,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 20" UNIT="day"> the land bearing N. W. by W. di&s;tant 10 leagues; and there &s;eemed to be land five leagues beyond it, to the N. E.; a re|markable peak, like a &s;ugar loaf, bore N. N. E. when we were about two leagues from the &s;hore, which afforded a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect, and was full of hou&s;es and inha|bitants. We &s;aw &s;everal large canoes near the &s;hore, under &s;ail, but they did not &s;teer towards the &s;hip. At noon, we were within two or three miles of the i&s;land, and it then bore from S. &frac34; W. to N. W. by W. We continued our cour&s;e along the &s;hore, &s;ometimes at the di&s;tance of half a mile, and &s;ometimes at the di&s;tance of four or five miles, but hitherto had got no &s;oundings. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we were a-brea&s;t of a fine river, and the coa&s;t having a better appearance here than in any other part that we had &s;een, I determined to &s;tand off and on all night, and try for anchor|age in the morning. As &s;oon as it was dark, we &s;aw a great number of lights all along the &s;hore. At day-break,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 21" UNIT="day"> we &s;ent out the boats to &s;ound, and &s;oon after, they made the &s;ignal for 20 fathom. This produced an univer&s;al joy, which it is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe, and we immediately ran in, and came to an anchor in 17 fathom, with a clear &s;andy bottom. We lay about a mile di&s;tant from the &s;hore, oppo|&s;ite to a fine run of water; the extreams of the land bearing from E. S. E. to N. W. by W. As &s;oon as we had &s;ecured the &s;hip, I &s;ent the boats to &s;ound along the coa&s;t, and look at the place where we &s;aw the water. At this time, a con|&s;iderable number of canoes came off to the &s;hip, and brought with them hogs, fowls, and fruit in great plenty, which we purcha&s;ed for trinkets and nails. But when the boats made towards the &s;hore, the canoes, mo&s;t of which were double, and very large, &s;ailed after them. At fir&s;t they kept at a di&s;tance, but as the boats approached the
<PB N="438" REF="274">
&s;hore,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 21" UNIT="day"> they grew bolder, and at la&s;t three of the large&s;t ran at the cutter, &s;taved in her quarter, and carried away her out-rigger, the Indians preparing at the &s;ame time to board her, with their clubs and paddles in their hands. Our people being thus pre&s;&s;ed, were obliged to fire, by which one of the a&s;&s;ailants was killed, and another much wounded. Upon receiving the &s;hot, they both fell overboard, and all the people who were in the &s;ame canoe, in&s;tantly leaped into the &s;ea after them: the other two canoes dropped a-&s;tern, and our boats went on without any farther interrup|tion. As &s;oon as the Indians, who were in the water, &s;aw that the boats &s;tood on without attempting to do them any farther hurt, they recovered their canoe, and hauled in their wounded companions. They &s;et them both upon their feet to &s;ee if they could &s;tand, and finding they could not, they tried whether they could &s;it upright: one of them could, and him they &s;upported in that po&s;ture, but perceiv|ing that the other was quite dead, they laid the body along at the bottom of the canoe. After this &s;ome of the canoes went a&s;hore, and others returned again to the &s;hip to traffick, which is a proof that our conduct had convinced them that while they behaved peaceably they had nothing to fear, and that they were con&s;cious they had brought the mi&s;chief which had ju&s;t happened upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The boats continued &s;ounding till noon, when they re|turned with an account that the ground was very clear; that it was at the depth of five fathom, within a quarter of a mile of the &s;hore, but that there was a very great &s;urf where we had &s;een the water. The officers told me, that the inhabitants &s;warmed upon the beach, and that many of them &s;wam off to the boat with fruit, and bamboos filled with water. They &s;aid that they were very importunate with them to come on &s;hore, particularly the women, who came down to the
<PB N="439" REF="275">
beach, and &s;tripping them&s;elves naked,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 21" UNIT="day"> endeavoured to allure them by many wanton ge&s;tures, the meaning of which could not po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken. At this time, however, our people re&s;i&s;ted the temptation.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, I &s;ent the boats again to the &s;hore, with &s;ome barecas, or &s;mall ca&s;ks, which are filled at the head, and have a handle by which they are carried, to endeavour to procure &s;ome water, of which we began to be in great want. In the mean time, many of the canoes continued about the &s;hip, but the Indians had been guilty of &s;o many thefts, that I would not &s;uffer any more of them to come on board.</P>
<P>At five in the evening, the boats returned with only two barecas of water, which the natives had filled for them; and as a compen&s;ation for their trouble, they thought fit to detain all the re&s;t. Our people, who did not leave their boat, tried every expedient they could think of to induce the Indians to return their water ve&s;&s;els, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and the Indians, in their turn, were very pre&s;&s;ing for our people to come on &s;hore, which they thought it prudent to decline. There were many thou&s;ands of the inhabitants of both &s;exes, and a great number of children on the beach, when our boats came away.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 22" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent the boats on &s;hore again for water, with nails, hatchets, and &s;uch other things as I thought mo&s;t likely to gain the friend&s;hip of the inhabitants. In the mean time, a great number of canoes came off to the &s;hip, with bread-fruit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a de&s;cription of this fruit in the Account of the Voyage of the Endeavour.</NOTE>, plantains, a fruit re&s;embling an apple only better, fowls, and hogs, which we purcha&s;ed with beads, nails, knives, and other articles of the like kind, &s;o
<PB N="440" REF="276">
that we procured pork enough to &s;erve the &s;hip's company two days,<MILESTONE N="Monday 22" UNIT="day"> at a pound a man.</P>
<P>When the boats returned, they brought us only a few caliba&s;hes of water, for the number of people on the beach was &s;o great, that they would not venture to land, though the young women repeated the allurements which they had practi&s;ed the day before, with &s;till more wanton, and, if po&s;&s;ible, le&s;s equivocal ge&s;tures. Fruit and provi&s;ions of various kinds were brought down and ranged upon the beach, of which our people were al&s;o invited to partake, as an additional inducement for them to leave the boat. They continued, however, inexorable, and &s;hewing the Indians the barecas on board, made &s;igns that they &s;hould bring down tho&s;e which had been detained the day before: to this the Indians were inexorable in their turn, and our people therefore weighed their grapplings, and &s;ounded all round the place, to &s;ee whether the &s;hip could come in near enough to cover the waterers, in which ca&s;e they might venture on &s;hore, in defiance of the whole i&s;land. When they put off, the women pelted them with apples and bananas, &s;houting, and &s;hewing every mark of deri&s;ion and contempt that they could devi&s;e. They reported, that the &s;hip might ride in four fathom water, with &s;andy ground, at two cables' length from the &s;hore, and in five fathom water at three cables' length. The wind here blew right along the &s;hore, rai&s;ing a great &s;urf on the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, and on the beach.</P>
<P>At day-break,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 23" UNIT="day"> the next morning, we weighed, with a de&s;ign to anchor off the watering-place. As we were &s;tand|ing off, to get farther to windward, we di&s;covered a bay about &s;ix or eight miles to leeward, over the land, from the
<PB N="441" REF="277">
ma&s;t-head, and immediately bore away for it,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 23" UNIT="day"> &s;ending the boats a-head to &s;ound. At nine o'clock, the boats making the &s;ignal for 12 fathom, we hauled round a reef, and &s;tood in, with a de&s;ign to come to an anchor; but when we came near the boats, one of which was on each bow, the &s;hip &s;truck. Her head continued immoveable, but her &s;tern was free; and, upon ca&s;ting the lead, we found the depth of water, upon the reef or &s;hoal, to be from 17 fathom to two and a half: we clewed all up as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and cleared the &s;hip of what lumber there happened to be upon the deck, at the &s;ame time getting out the long-boat, with the &s;tream and kedge anchors, the &s;tream cable and hau&s;er, in order to carry them without the reef, that when they had taken ground, the &s;hip might be drawn off towards them, by applying a great force to the cap&s;tern, but unhappily without the reef we had no bottom. Our condition was now very alarming, the &s;hip continued beating again&s;t the rock with great force, and we were &s;urrounded by many hundred canoes, full of men: they did not, however, attempt to come on board us, but &s;eemed to wait in ex|pectation of our &s;hipwreck. In the anxiety and terror of &s;uch a &s;ituation we continued near an hour, without being able to do any thing for our deliverance, except &s;taving &s;ome water ca&s;ks in the fore-hold, when a breeze happily &s;pring|ing up from the &s;hore, the &s;hip's head &s;wung off. We immediately pre&s;&s;ed her with all the &s;ail we could make; upon which &s;he began to move, and was very &s;oon once more in deep water.</P>
<P>We now &s;tood off, and the boats being &s;ent to leeward, found that the reef ran down to the we&s;tward about a mile and a half, and that beyond it there was a very good har|bour. The ma&s;ter, after having placed a boat at the end of the reef, and furni&s;hed the long-boat with anchor and hau&s;ers,
<PB N="442" REF="278">
and a guard to defend her from an attack of the Indians,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 23" UNIT="day"> came on board, and piloted the &s;hip round the reef into the harbour, where, about twelve o'clock, &s;he came to an an|chor in 17 fathom water, with a fine bottom of black &s;and.</P>
<P>The place where the &s;hip &s;truck appeared, upon farther examination, to be a reef of &s;harp coral rock, with very un|equal &s;oundings, from &s;ix fathom to two; and it happened unfortunately to lie between the two boats that were placed as a direction to the &s;hip, the weathermo&s;t boat having 12 fathom, and the leewardmo&s;t nine. The wind fre&s;hened almo&s;t as &s;oon as we got off, and though it &s;oon became calm again, the &s;urf ran &s;o high, and broke with &s;uch vio|lence upon the rock, that if the &s;hip had continued fa&s;t half an hour longer, &s;he mu&s;t inevitably have been beaten to pieces. Upon examining her bottom, we could not di&s;|cover that &s;he had received any damage, except that a &s;mall piece was beaten off the bottom of the rudder. She did not appear to admit any water, but the tru&s;sle-trees, at the head of all the ma&s;ts, were broken &s;hort, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened while &s;he was beating again&s;t the rock. Our boats lo&s;t their grapplings upon the reef, but as we had rea&s;on to hope that the &s;hip was &s;ound, they gave us very little concern. As &s;oon as the &s;hip was &s;ecured, I &s;ent the ma&s;ter, with all the boats manned and armed, to &s;ound the upper part of the bay, that if he found good an|chorage we might warp the &s;hip up within the reef, and anchor her in &s;afety. The weather was now very plea&s;ant, a great number of canoes were upon the reef, and the &s;hore was crouded with people.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon the ma&s;ter returned, and reported, that there was every where good anchorage; I therefore determined to warp the &s;hip up the bay early in

the morning, and in the mean time,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 23" UNIT="day"> I put the people at four watches, one watch to be always under arms; loaded and primed all the guns, fixed mu&s;quetoons in all the boats, and ordered all the people who were not upon the watch, to re|pair to the quarters a&s;&s;igned them, at a moment's warning there being a great number of canoes, &s;ome of them very large, and full of men, hovering upon the &s;hore, and many &s;maller venturing to the &s;hip, with hogs, fowls, and fruit, which we purcha&s;ed of them, much to the &s;atisfaction of both parties; and at &s;un-&s;et, all the canoes rowed in to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 24" UNIT="day"> we began to warp the &s;hip up the harbour, and &s;oon after, a great number of canoes came under her &s;tern. As I perceived that they had hogs, fowls, and fruit on board, I ordered the gunner, and two mid&s;hipmen, to purcha&s;e them for knives, nails, beads, and other trinkets, at the &s;ame time prohibiting the trade to all other per&s;ons on board. By eight o'clock, the number of canoes was greatly increa&s;ed, and tho&s;e that came la&s;t up were double, of a very large &s;ize, with twelve or fifteen &s;tout men in each. I ob&s;erved, with &s;ome concern, that they ap|peared to be furni&s;hed rather for war than trade, having very little on board except round pebble &s;tones; I therefore &s;ent for Mr. Furneaux, my fir&s;t lieutenant being &s;till very ill, and ordered him to keep the fourth watch con&s;tantly at their arms, while the re&s;t of the people were warping the &s;hip. In the mean time more canoes were continually coming off from the &s;hore, which were freighted very dif|ferently from the re&s;t, for they had on board a number of women who were placed in a row, and who, when they came near the &s;hip, made all the wanton ge&s;tures that can be conceived. While the&s;e ladies were practi&s;ing their al|lurements, the large canoes, which were freighted with
<PB N="444" REF="281">
&s;tones,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 24" UNIT="day"> drew together very clo&s;e round the &s;hip, &s;ome of the men on board &s;inging in a hoar&s;e voice, &s;ome blowing conchs, and &s;ome playing on a flute. After &s;ome time, a man who &s;at upon a canopy that was fixed on one of the large double canoes, made &s;igns that he wi&s;hed to come up to the &s;hip's &s;ide; I immediately intimated my con&s;ent, and when he came along &s;ide, he gave one of the men a bunch of red and yellow feathers, making &s;igns that he &s;hould carry it to me. I received it with expre&s;&s;ions of amity, and immediately got &s;ome trinkets to pre&s;ent him in return, but to my great &s;urpri&s;e he had put off to a little di&s;tance from the &s;hip, and upon his throwing up the branch of a cocoa-nut tree, there was an univer&s;al &s;hout from all the canoes, which at once moved towards the &s;hip, and a &s;hower of &s;tones was poured into her on every &s;ide. As an attack was now begun, in which our arms only could render us &s;upe|rior to the multitude that a&s;&s;ailed us, e&s;pecially as great part of the &s;hip's company was in a &s;ick and feeble condition, I ordered the guard to fire; two of the quarter-deck guns, which I had loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, were al&s;o fired nearly at the &s;ame time, and the Indians appeared to be thrown into &s;ome confu&s;ion: in a few minutes, however, they renewed the attack, and all our people that were able to come upon deck, having by this time got to their quarters, I ordered them to fire the great guns, and to play &s;ome of them con|&s;tantly at a place on &s;hore, where a great number of canoes were &s;till taking in men, and pu&s;hing off towards the &s;hip with the utmo&s;t expedition. When the great guns began to fire, there were not le&s;s than three hundred canoes about the &s;hip, having on board at lea&s;t two thou&s;and men; many thou&s;ands were al&s;o upon the &s;hore, and more canoes coming from every quarter: the firing, however, &s;oon drove away the canoes that were about the &s;hip, and put a &s;top to the
<PB N="445" REF="282">
coming off of others.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 24" UNIT="day"> As &s;oon as I &s;aw &s;ome of them re|treating, and the re&s;t quiet, I ordered the firing to cea&s;e, hoping that they were &s;ufficiently convinced of our &s;uperi|ority, not to renew the conte&s;t. In this, however, I was unhappily mi&s;taken: a great number of the canoes that had been di&s;per&s;ed, &s;oon drew together again, and lay &s;ome time on their paddles, looking at the &s;hip from the di&s;tance of about a quarter of a mile, and then &s;uddenly hoi&s;ting white &s;treamers, pulled towards the &s;hip's &s;tern, and began again to throw &s;tones, with great force and dexterity, by the help of &s;lings, from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance: each of the&s;e &s;tones weighed about two pounds, and many of them wounded the people on board, who would have &s;uffered much more, if an awning had not been &s;pread over the whole deck to keep out the &s;un, and the hammocks placed in the nettings. At the &s;ame time &s;everal canoes, well manned, were making towards the &s;hip's bow, having probably taken notice that no &s;hot had been fired from this part: I therefore ordered &s;ome guns forward, to be well pointed and fired at the&s;e canoes; at the &s;ame time running out two guns abaft, and pointing them well at the canoes that were making the attack. Among the canoes that were coming toward the bow, there was one which appeared to have &s;ome Chief on board, as it was by &s;ignals made from her, that the others had been called to|gether: it happened that a &s;hot, fired from the guns for|ward, hit this canoe &s;o full as to cut it a&s;under. As &s;oon as this was ob&s;erved by the re&s;t, they di&s;per&s;ed with &s;uch ha&s;te that in half an hour there was not a &s;ingle canoe to be &s;een; the people al&s;o who had crouded the &s;hore, immediately fled over the hills with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>Having now no rea&s;on to fear any further interruption, we warped the &s;hip up the harbour, and by noon, we were
<PB N="446" REF="283">
not more than half a mile from the upper part of the bay,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 24" UNIT="day"> within le&s;s than two cables' length of a fine river, and about two and a half of the reef. We had here nine fathom water, and clo&s;e to the &s;hore there were five. We moored the &s;hip, and carried out the &s;tream-anchor, with the two &s;hroud hau&s;ers, for a &s;pring, to keep the &s;hip's broad-&s;ide a-brea&s;t of the river; we al&s;o got up and mounted the eight guns which had been put into the hold. As &s;oon as this was done, the boats were employed in &s;ounding all round the bay, and in examining the &s;hore where any of the in|habitants appeared, in order to di&s;cover, whether it was pro|bable that they would give us any further di&s;turbance. All the afternoon,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> and part of the next morning, was &s;pent in this &s;ervice; and about noon, the ma&s;ter returned, with a tolerable &s;urvey of the place, and reported, that there were no canoes in &s;ight; that there was good landing on every part of the beach; that there was nothing in the bay from which danger could be apprehended, except the reef, and &s;ome rocks at the upper end, which appeared above water; and that the river, though it emptied it&s;elf on the other &s;ide of the point, was fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>Soon after the ma&s;ter had brought me this account, I &s;ent Mr. Furneaux again, with all the boats manned and armed, the marines being al&s;o put on board, with orders to land oppo&s;ite to our &s;tation, and &s;ecure him&s;elf, under cover of the boats and the &s;hip, in the cleare&s;t ground he could find. About two o'clock the boats landed without any oppo&s;ition, and Mr. Furneaux &s;tuck up a &s;taff, upon which he hoi&s;ted a pendant, turned a turf, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land in his Maje&s;ty's name, in honour of whom he called it KING GEORGE THE THIRD's ISLAND: he then went to the river, and ta&s;ted the water, which he found excellent, and mixing &s;ome of it with rum, every man drank his Maje&s;ty's health.
<PB N="447" REF="284">
While he was at the river,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> which was about twelve yards wide, and fordable, he &s;aw two old men on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of it, who perceiving that they were di&s;covered, put them|&s;elves in a &s;upplicatory po&s;ture, and &s;eemed to be in great terror and confu&s;ion. Mr. Furneaux made &s;igns that they &s;hould come over the river, and one of them complied. When he landed, he came forward, creeping upon his hands and knees, but Mr. Furneaux rai&s;ed him up, and while he &s;tood trembling, &s;hewed him &s;ome of the &s;tones that were thrown at the &s;hip, and endeavoured to make him apprehend that if the natives attempted no mi&s;chief again&s;t us, we &s;hould do no harm to them. He ordered two of the water ca&s;ks to be filled, to &s;hew the Indian that we wanted water, and produced &s;ome hatchets, and other things, to intimate that he wi&s;hed to trade for provi&s;ions. The old man, during this pantomimical conver&s;ation, in &s;ome degree recovered his &s;pirits; and Mr. Furneaux, to confirm his profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, gave him a hatchet, &s;ome nails, beads, and other trifles; after which he reimbarked on board the boats, and left the pendant flying. As &s;oon as the boats were put off, the old man went up to the pendant, and danced round it a con&s;iderable time: he then retired, but &s;oon after re|turned with &s;ome green boughs, which he threw down, and retired a &s;econd time: it was not long, however, before he appeared again, with about a dozen of the inhabitants, and putting them&s;elves in a &s;upplicating po&s;ture, they all ap|proached the pendant in a &s;low pace, but the wind happening to move it, when they were got clo&s;e to it, they &s;uddenly retreated with the greate&s;t precipitation. After &s;tanding &s;ome time at a di&s;tance, and gazing at it, they went away, but in a &s;hort time came back, with two large hogs alive, which they laid down at the foot of the &s;taff, and at length taking courage, they began to dance. When they had per|formed
<PB N="448" REF="285">
this ceremony,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> they brought the hogs down to the water &s;ide, launched a canoe, and put them on board. The old man, who had a large white beard, then embarked with them alone, and brought them to the &s;hip: when he came along &s;ide, he made a &s;et &s;peech, and afterwards handed in &s;everal green plantain leaves, one by one, uttering a &s;en|tence, in a &s;olemn &s;low tone, with each of them as he de|livered it; after this he &s;ent on board the two hogs, and then turning round, pointed to the land. I ordered &s;ome pre&s;ents to be given him, but he would accept of nothing; and &s;oon after put off his canoe, and went on &s;hore.</P>
<P>At night, &s;oon after it was dark, we heard the noi&s;e of many drums, with conchs, and other wind in&s;truments, and &s;aw a multitude of lights all along the coa&s;t.<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> At &s;ix in the morning, &s;eeing none of the natives on &s;hore, and ob&s;erving that the pendant was taken away, which probably they had learnt to de&s;pi&s;e, as the frogs in the fable did King Log, I ordered the lieutenant to take a guard on &s;hore, and if all was well, to &s;end off, that we might begin watering: in a &s;hort time I had the &s;atisfaction to find that he had &s;ent off for water ca&s;ks, and by eight o'clock, we had four tons of water on board. While our people were employed in filling the ca&s;ks, &s;everal of the natives appeared on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, with the old man whom the officer had &s;een the day before; and &s;oon after he came over, and brought with him a little fruit, and a few fowls, which were al&s;o &s;ent off to the &s;hip. At this time, having been very ill for near a fortnight, I was &s;o weak that I could &s;carcely crawl about; however, I employed my gla&s;&s;es to &s;ee what was doing on &s;hore. At near half an hour after eight o'clock, I perceived a multitude of the natives coming over a hill at about the di&s;tance of a mile, and at the &s;ame time a great number of canoes making round the we&s;tern point, and
<PB N="449" REF="286">
keeping clo&s;e along the &s;hore.<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> I then looked at the water|ing-place, and &s;aw at the back of it, where it was clear, a very numerous party of the natives creeping along behind the bu&s;hes; I &s;aw al&s;o many thou&s;ands in the woods, pu&s;h|ing along towards the watering-place, and canoes coming very fa&s;t round the other point of the bay to the ea&s;tward. Being alarmed at the&s;e appearances, I di&s;patched a boat, to acquaint the officer on &s;hore with what I had &s;een, and order him immediately to come on board with his men, and leave the ca&s;ks behind him: he had, however, di&s;covered his danger, and embarked before the boat reached him. Having perceived the Indians that were creeping towards him under &s;helter of the wood, he immediately di&s;patch|ed the old man to them, making &s;igns that they &s;hould keep at a di&s;tance, and that he wanted nothing but water. As &s;oon as they perceived that they were di&s;covered, they began to &s;hout, and advanced with greater &s;peed. The of|ficer immediately repaired to the boats with his people, and the Indians, in the mean time having cro&s;&s;ed the river, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the water ca&s;ks, with great appearance of exulta|tion and joy. The canoes now pulled along the &s;hore, to|wards the place, with the utmo&s;t expedition, all the people on land keeping pace with them, except a multitude of women and children, who &s;eated them&s;elves upon a hill which overlooked the bay and the beach. The canoes from each point of the bay, as they drew nearer to that part of it where the &s;hip was at anchor, put on &s;hore, and took in more men, who had great bags in their hands, which after|wards appeared to be filled with &s;tones. All the canoes that had come round the points, and many others that had put off from the &s;hore within the bay, now made towards the &s;hip, &s;o that I had no doubt but that they intended to try
<PB N="450" REF="287">
their fortune in a &s;econd attack.<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> As to &s;horten the conte&s;t would certainly le&s;&s;en the mi&s;chief, I determined to make this action deci&s;ive, and put an end to ho&s;tilities at once; I therefore ordered the people, who were all at their quarters, to fire fir&s;t upon the canoes which were drawn together in groups: this was immediately done &s;o effectually, that tho&s;e which were to the we&s;tward made towards the &s;hore as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and tho&s;e to the ea&s;tward, getting round the reef, were &s;oon beyond the reach of our guns. I then di|rected the fire into the wood in different parts, which &s;oon drove the Indians out of it, who ran up the hill where the women and children had &s;eated them&s;elves to &s;ee the battle. Upon this hill there were now &s;everal thou&s;ands who thought them&s;elves in perfect &s;ecurity; but to convince them of the contrary, and hoping that when they &s;aw the &s;hot fall much farther than they could think po&s;&s;ible, they would &s;uppo&s;e it could reach them at any di&s;tance, I ordered &s;ome of the guns to be let down as low as they would admit, and fired four &s;hot towards them. Two of the balls fell clo&s;e by a tree where a great number of the&s;e people were fitting, and &s;truck them with &s;uch terror and con&s;ternation, that in le&s;s than two minutes not one of them was to be &s;een. Having thus cleared the coa&s;t, I manned and armed the boats, and putting a &s;trong guard on board, I &s;ent all the carpenters with their axes, and ordered them to de&s;troy every canoe that had been run a&s;hore. Before noon, this &s;ervice was effectually performed, and more than fifty canoes, many of which were &s;ixty feet long, and three broad, and la&s;hed together, were cut to pieces. Nothing was found in them but &s;tones and &s;lings, except a little fruit, and a few fowls and hogs, which were on board two or three canoes of a much &s;maller &s;ize.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="288">At two o'clock in the afternoon,<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> about ten of the natives came out of the wood with green boughs in their hands, which they &s;tuck up near the water &s;ide, and retired. After a &s;hort time, they appeared again, and brought with them &s;everal hogs, with their legs tied, which they placed near the green boughs, and retired a &s;econd time. After this they brought down &s;everal more hogs, and &s;ome dogs, with their fore legs tied over their heads, and going again into the woods, brought back &s;everal bundles of the cloth which they u&s;e for apparel, and which has &s;ome re&s;emblance to Indian paper. The&s;e they placed upon the beach, and called to us on board to fetch them away. As we were at the di&s;tance of about three cables' length, we could not then perfectly di&s;cover of what this peace-offering con&s;i&s;ted: we gue&s;&s;ed at the hogs and the cloth, but &s;eeing the dogs, with their fore legs appearing over the hinder part of the neck, ri&s;e up &s;everal times, and run a little way in an erect po&s;ture, we took them for &s;ome &s;trange unknown animal, and were very impatient to have a nearer view of them. The boat was therefore &s;ent on &s;hore with all expedition, and our wonder was &s;oon at an end. Our people found nine good hogs, be&s;ides the dogs and the cloth: the hogs were brought off, but the dogs were turned loo&s;e, and with the cloth left behind. In return for the hogs, our people left upon the &s;hore &s;ome hatchets, nails, and other things, making &s;igns to &s;ome of the Indians who were in &s;ight, to take them away with their cloth. Soon after the boat had come on board, the Indians brought down two more hogs, and called to us to fetch them; the boat therefore returned, and fetched off the two hogs, but &s;till left the cloth, though the Indians made &s;igns that we &s;hould take it. Our people reported, that they had not touched any of the things which
<PB N="452" REF="289">
they had left upon the beach for them,<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> and &s;omebody &s;ug|ge&s;ting that they would not take our offering becau&s;e we had not accepted their cloth, I gave orders that it &s;hould be fetched away. The event proved that the conjecture was true, for the moment the boat had taken the cloth on board, the Indians came down, and with every po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tra|tion of joy, carried away all I had &s;ent them into the wood. Our boats then went to the watering-place, and filled and brought off all the ca&s;ks, to the amount of about &s;ix tons. We found that they had &s;uffered no injury while they had been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Indians, but &s;ome leathern buckets and funnels which had been taken away with the ca&s;ks, were not returned.</P>
<P>The next morning I &s;ent the boats on &s;hore,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> with a guard, to fill &s;ome more ca&s;ks with water, and &s;oon after the people were on &s;hore, the &s;ame old man who had come over the river to them the fir&s;t day, came again to the farther &s;ide of it, where he made a long &s;peech, and then cro&s;&s;ed the water. When he came up to the waterers, the officer &s;hewed him the &s;tones that were piled up like cannon balls upon the &s;hore, and had been brought thither &s;ince our fir&s;t landing, and &s;ome of the bags that had been taken out of the canoes which I had ordered to be de&s;troyed, filled with &s;tones, and endeavoured to make him under&s;tand that the Indians had been the aggre&s;&s;ors, and that the mi&s;chief we had done them was in our own defence. The old man &s;eemed to apprehend his meaning, but not to admit it: he immediately made a &s;peech to the people, pointing to the &s;tones, &s;lings, and bags, with great emotion, and &s;ometimes his looks, ge&s;tures, and voice were &s;o furious as to be frightful. His pa&s;&s;ions, however, &s;ub&s;ided by degrees, and the officer, who to his great regret could not under&s;tand one
<PB N="453" REF="290">
word of all that he had &s;aid, endeavoured to convince him,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> by all the &s;igns he could devi&s;e, that we wi&s;hed to live in friend&s;hip with them, and were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew them every mark of kindne&s;s in our power. He then &s;hook hands with him, and embraced him, giving him at the &s;ame time &s;eve|ral &s;uch trinkets as he thought would be mo&s;t acceptable. He contrived al&s;o to make the old man under&s;tand that we wi&s;hed to traffick for provi&s;ions, that the Indians &s;hould not come down in great numbers, and that they &s;hould keep on one &s;ide of the river and we on the other. After this the old man went away with great appearance of &s;atisfaction, and before noon a trade was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which furni&s;hed us with hogs, fowls, and fruit in great abundance, &s;o that all the &s;hip's company, whether &s;ick or well, had as much as they could u&s;e.</P>

<P>MATTERS being thus happily &s;ettled,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent the Sur|geon, with the Second Lieutenant, to examine the country, and fix upon &s;ome place where the &s;ick might take up their re&s;idence on &s;hore. When they returned, they &s;aid, that with re&s;pect to health and convenience, all the places that they had &s;een upon the i&s;land &s;eemed to be equally proper; but that with re&s;pect to &s;afety, they could recom|mend none but the watering-place, as they would be there under the protection of the &s;hip and the guard, and would ea&s;ily be prevented from &s;traggling into the country, and brought off to their meals. To the watering-place therefore I &s;ent them, with tho&s;e that were employed in filling the ca&s;ks, and appointed the gunner to command the party that was to be their guard. A tent was erected for them as a &s;helter both from the &s;un and the rain, and the Surgeon was &s;ent to &s;uperintend their conduct, and give his advice if it &s;hould be wanted. It happened that walking out with his gun, after he had &s;een the &s;ick properly di&s;po&s;ed of in the tent, a wild duck flew over his head, which he &s;hot, and it fell dead among &s;ome of the natives who were on the other &s;ide of the river. This threw them into a panic, and
<PB N="455" REF="292">
they all ran away:<MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> when they got to &s;ome di&s;tance they &s;topped, and he made &s;igns to them to bring the duck over: this one of them at la&s;t ventured to do, and, pale and trem|bling, laid it down at his feet. Several other ducks happen|ing at the in&s;tant to fly over the &s;pot where they were &s;tanding, he fired again, and fortunately brought down three more. This incident gave the natives &s;uch a dread of a gun, that if a mu&s;quet was pointed at a thou&s;and of them, they would all run away like a flock of &s;heep; and probably the ea&s;e with which they were afterwards kept at a di&s;tance, and their orderly behaviour in their traffick, was in a great mea&s;ure owing to their having upon this occa&s;ion &s;een the in&s;trument of which before they had only felt the effects.</P>
<P>As I fore&s;aw that a private traffick would probably com|mence between &s;uch of our people as were on &s;hore, and the natives, and that if it was left to their own caprice, perpetual quarrels and mi&s;chief would en&s;ue, I ordered that all mat|ters of traffick &s;hould be tran&s;acted by the gunner, on behalf of both parties, and I directed him to &s;ee that no injury was done to the natives, either by violence or fraud, and by all po&s;&s;ible means to attach the old man to his intere&s;t. This &s;ervice he performed with great diligence and fidelity, nor did he neglect to complain of tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my orders, which was of infinite advantage to all parties; for as I puni&s;hed the fir&s;t offenders with a nece&s;&s;ary &s;everity, many irregularities, that would otherwi&s;e have produced the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, were prevented: we were al&s;o indebted for many advantages to the old man, who&s;e cau|tion kept our people perpetually upon their guard, and &s;oon brought back tho&s;e who &s;traggled from the party. The natives would indeed &s;ometimes pilfer, but by the terror of a gun, without u&s;ing it, he always found means to make them bring back what was &s;tolen. A fellow had one day the

The gunner then in&s;i&s;ted that the offender &s;hould be delivered up, and with this al&s;o the old man, though not without great reluctance, com|plied. When the fellow was brought down, the gunner knew him to be an old offender, and therefore &s;ent him pri|&s;oner on board. I had no intention to puni&s;h him otherwi&s;e, than by the fear of puni&s;hment, and therefore, after great entreaty and interce&s;&s;ion, I gave him his liberty, and &s;ent him on &s;hore. When the natives &s;aw him return in &s;afety, it is hard to &s;ay whether their a&s;toni&s;hment or joy was greate&s;t; they received him with univer&s;al acclamations, and immediately carried him off into the woods: the next day, however, he returned, and as a propitiation to the gunner, he brought him a con&s;iderable quantity of bread-fruit, and a large hog, ready roa&s;ted.</P>
<P>At this time, the people on board were employed in caulking and painting the weather-work, over-hauling the rigging, &s;towing the hold, and doing other nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but my di&s;order, which was a bilious cholic, increa&s;ed &s;o much, that this day I was obliged to take to my bed; my Fir&s;t Lieutenant al&s;o &s;till continued very ill, and the Pur&s;er was incapable of his duty. The whole command devolved upon Mr. Furneaux, the Second Lieutenant, to whom I gave general directions, and recommended a particular attention to the people on &s;hore. I al&s;o ordered that fruit and fre&s;h provi&s;ions &s;hould be &s;erved to the &s;hip's company as long as they could be procured, and that the boats &s;hould never be

The men were con&s;tantly &s;erved with fre&s;h pork, fowls, and fruit, in &s;uch plenty, that when I left my bed, after having been confined to it near a fortnight, my &s;hip's company looked &s;o fre&s;h and healthy, that I could &s;carcely believe them to be the &s;ame people.</P>
<P>Sunday the 28th was marked by no incident; <MILESTONE N="Sunday 28" UNIT="day"> but on Mon|day the 29th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 29" UNIT="day"> one of the gunner's party found a piece of &s;altpetre near as big as an egg. As this was an object of equal curio&s;ity and importance, diligent enquiry was im|mediately made from whence it came. The &s;urgeon a&s;ked every one of the people on &s;hore, &s;eparately, whether he had brought it from the &s;hip; every one on board al&s;o was a&s;ked whether he had carried it on &s;hore, but all declared that they had never had &s;uch a thing in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Appli|cation was then made to the natives, but the meaning of both parties was &s;o imperfectly conveyed by &s;igns, that nothing could be learnt of them about it: during our whole &s;tay here, however, we &s;aw no more than this one piece.</P>
<P>While the gunner was trafficking for provi&s;ions on &s;hore, we &s;ometimes hauled the &s;eine, but we caught no fi&s;h; we al&s;o frequently crawled, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s: the di&s;|appointment, however, was not felt, for the produce of the i&s;land enabled our people to "fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day."</P>
<P>All matters continued in the &s;ame &s;ituation till the 2d of July, when our old man being ab&s;ent,<MILESTONE N="July" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 2" UNIT="day"> the &s;upply of fre&s;h provi&s;ions and fruit fell &s;hort; we had, however, enough to
<PB N="458" REF="295">
&s;erve mo&s;t of the me&s;&s;es, re&s;erving plenty for the &s;ick and convale&s;cent.</P>
<P>On the 3d,<MILESTONE N="Friday 3" UNIT="day"> we heeled the &s;hip, and looked at her bottom, which we found as clean as when &s;he came out of dock, and to our great &s;atisfaction, as &s;ound. During all this time, none of the natives came near our boats, or the &s;hip, in their canoes. This day, about noon, we caught a very large &s;hark, and when the boats went to fetch the people on board to dinner, we &s;ent it on &s;hore. When the boats were putting off again, the gunner &s;eeing &s;ome of the natives on the other &s;ide of the river, beckoned them to come over; they immediately complied, and he gave them the &s;hark, which they &s;oon cut to pieces, and carried away with great appearance of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 5th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 5" UNIT="day"> the old man returned to the market-tent, and made the gunner under&s;tand that he had been up the country, to prevail upon the people to bring down their hogs, poultry, and fruit, of which the parts near the water|ing-place were now nearly exhau&s;ted. The good effects of his expedition &s;oon appeared, for &s;everal Indians, whom our people had never &s;een before, came in with &s;ome hogs that were larger than any that had been yet brought to market. In the mean time, the old man ventured off in his canoe, to the &s;hip, and brought with him, as a pre&s;ent to me, a hog ready roa&s;ted. I was much plea&s;ed with his attention and liberality, and gave him, in return for his hog, an iron pot, a looking-gla&s;s, a drinking-gla&s;s, and &s;everal other things, which no man in the i&s;land was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>While our people were on &s;hore, &s;everal young women were permitted to cro&s;s the river, who, though they were not aver&s;e to the granting of per&s;onal favours, knew the
<PB N="459" REF="296">
value of them too well not to &s;tipulate for a con&s;ideration:<MILESTONE N="Sunday 5" UNIT="day"> the price, indeed, was not great, yet it was &s;uch as our men were not always able to pay, and under this temptation they &s;tole nails and other iron from the &s;hip. The nails that we brought for traffick, were not always in their reach, and therefore they drew &s;everal out of different parts of the ve&s;|&s;el, particularly tho&s;e that fa&s;tened the cleats to the &s;hip's &s;ide. This was productive of a double mi&s;chief; damage to the &s;hip, and a con&s;iderable ri&s;e at market. When the gun|ner offered, as u&s;ual, &s;mall nails for hogs of a middling &s;ize, the natives refu&s;ed to take them, and produced large &s;pikes, intimating that they expected &s;uch nails as the&s;e. A mo&s;t diligent enquiry was &s;et on foot to di&s;cover the offenders, but all to no purpo&s;e; and though a large reward was offered to procure intelligence, none was obtained. I was mortified at the di&s;appointment, but I was &s;till more morti|fied at a fraud which I found &s;ome of our people had prac|ti&s;ed upon the natives. When no nails were to be procured, they had &s;tolen lead, and cut it up in the &s;hape of nails. Many of the natives who had been paid with this ba&s;e mo|ney, brought their leaden nails, with great &s;implicity, to the gunner, and reque&s;ted him to give them iron in their &s;tead. With this reque&s;t, however rea&s;onable, he could not com|ply; becau&s;e, by rendering lead current, it would have en|couraged the &s;tealing it, and the market would have been as effectually &s;poiled by tho&s;e who could not procure nails, as by tho&s;e who could; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary, upon every account, to render this leaden currency of no value, though for our honour I &s;hould have been glad to have called it in.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 7th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent one of the mates, with thirty men, to a village at a little di&s;tance from the market, hoping
<PB N="460" REF="297">
that refre&s;hments might there be bought at the original price; <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> but here they were obliged to give &s;till more than at the water-&s;ide. In the mean time, being this day able to get up for the fir&s;t time, and the weather being fine, I went into a boat, and rowed about four miles down the coa&s;t. I found the country populous, and plea&s;ant in the highe&s;t degree, and &s;aw many canoes on the &s;hore; but not one came off to us, nor did the people &s;eem to take the lea&s;t notice of us as we pa&s;&s;ed along. About noon I returned to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>The commerce which our men had found means to e&s;ta|bli&s;h with the women of the i&s;land, rendered them much le&s;s obedient to the orders that had been given for the regu|lation of their conduct on &s;hore, than they were at fir&s;t. I found it nece&s;&s;ary therefore, to read the articles of war, and I puni&s;hed James Proctor, the corporal of marines, who had not only quitted his &s;tation, and in&s;ulted the officer, but &s;truck the Ma&s;ter at Arms &s;uch a blow as brought him to the ground.</P>
<P>The next day,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 8" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent a party up the country to cut wood, and they met with &s;ome of the natives, who treated them with great kindness and ho&s;pitality. Several of the&s;e friendly Indians came on board in our boat, and &s;eemed, both by their dre&s;s and behaviour, to be of a &s;uperior rank. To the&s;e people I paid a particular attention, and to di&s;cover what pre&s;ent would mo&s;t gratify them, I laid down before them a Johannes, a guinea, a crown piece, a Spani&s;h dollar, a few &s;hillings, &s;ome new halfpence, and two large nails, making &s;igns that they &s;hould take what they liked be&s;t. The nails were fir&s;t &s;eized, with great eagerne&s;s, and then a few of the halfpence, but the &s;ilver and gold lay neglected. Having pre&s;ented them, therefore, with &s;ome nails and halfpence, I &s;ent them on &s;hore &s;uperlatively happy.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="298">From this time, our market was very ill &s;upplied,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 8" UNIT="day"> the Indians refu&s;ing to &s;ell provi&s;ions at the u&s;ual price, and making &s;igns for large nails. It was now thought nece&s;&s;ary to look more diligently about the &s;hip, to di&s;cover what nails had been drawn; and it was &s;oon found that all the belaying cleats had been ripped off, and that there was &s;carcely one of the hammock nails left. All hands were now ordered up, and I practi&s;ed every artifice I could think of to di&s;cover the thieves, but without &s;ucce&s;s. I then told them that till the thieves were di&s;covered, not a &s;ingle man &s;hould go on &s;hore: this however produced no effect, except that Proctor, the corporal, behaved in a mutinous manner, for which he was in&s;tantly puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 11th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 11" UNIT="day"> in the afternoon, the gunner came on board with a tall woman, who &s;eemed to be about five and forty years of age, of a plea&s;ing countenance and ma|je&s;tic deportment. He told me that &s;he was but ju&s;t come into that part of the country, and that &s;eeing great re&s;pect paid her by the re&s;t of the natives, he had made her &s;ome pre&s;ents; in return for which &s;he had invited him to her hou&s;e, which was about two miles up the valley, and given him &s;ome large hogs; after which &s;he returned with him to the watering-place, and expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to go on board the &s;hip, in which he had thought it proper, on all accounts, that &s;he &s;hould be gratified. She &s;eemed to be under no re&s;traint, either from diffidence or fear, when &s;he fir&s;t came into the &s;hip; and &s;he behaved, all the while &s;he was on board, with an ea&s;y freedom, that always di&s;tingui&s;hes con|&s;cious &s;uperiority and habitual command. I gave her a large blue mantle, that reached from her &s;houlders to her feet, which I threw over her, and tied on with ribands; I gave her al&s;o a looking-gla&s;s, beads of &s;everal &s;orts, and many other things, of which &s;he accepted with a very good
<PB N="462" REF="299">
grace,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 11" UNIT="day"> and much plea&s;ure. She took notice that I had been ill, and pointed to the &s;hore. I under&s;tood that &s;he meant I &s;hould go thither to perfect my recovery, and I made &s;igns that I would go thither the next morning. When &s;he inti|mated an inclination to return, I ordered the gunner to go with her, who, having &s;et her on &s;hore, attended her to her habitation, which he de&s;cribed as being very large and well built. He &s;aid, that in this hou&s;e &s;he had many guards and dome&s;ticks, and that &s;he had another at a little di&s;tance, which was enclo&s;ed in lattice-work.</P>
<P>The next morning I went on &s;hore for the fir&s;t time,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 12" UNIT="day"> and my prince&s;s, or rather queen, for &s;uch by her authority &s;he appeared to be, &s;oon after came to me, followed by many of her attendants. As &s;he perceived that my di&s;order had left me very weak, &s;he ordered her people to take me in their arms, and carry me not only over the river, but all the way to her hou&s;e; and ob&s;erving that &s;ome of the people who were with me, particularly the Fir&s;t Lieutenant and Pur&s;er, had al&s;o been &s;ick, &s;he cau&s;ed them al&s;o to be carried in the &s;ame manner, and a guard, which I had ordered out upon the occa&s;ion, followed. In our way, a va&s;t multitude crouded about us, but upon her waving her hand, without &s;peaking a word, they withdrew, and left us a free pa&s;&s;age. When we approached near her hou&s;e, a great number of both &s;exes came out to meet her: the&s;e &s;he pre&s;ented to me, after having intimated by &s;igns that they were her relations, and taking hold of my hand, &s;he made them ki&s;s it. We then entered the hou&s;e, which covered a piece of ground 327 feet long, and 42 feet broad. It con&s;i&s;ted of a roof, thatched with palm leaves, and rai&s;ed upon 39 pillars on each &s;ide, and 14 in the middle. The ridge of the thatch, on the in&s;ide, was 30 feet high, and the &s;ides of the hou&s;e, to the edge of the roof, were 12 feet high; all below the

As &s;oon as we entered the hou&s;e,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 12" UNIT="day"> &s;he made us &s;it down, and then calling four young girls, &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to take off my &s;hoes, draw down my &s;tockings, and pull off my coat, and then directed them to &s;mooth down the &s;kin, and gently chafe it with their hands: the &s;ame operation was al&s;o performed upon the Fir&s;t Lieutenant and the Pur&s;er, but upon none of tho&s;e who appeared to be in health. While this was doing, our Surgeon, who had walked till he was very warm, took off his wig to cool and refre&s;h him&s;elf: a &s;udden exclamation of one of the Indians who &s;aw it, drew the attention of the re&s;t, and in a moment every eye was fixed upon the prodigy, and every operation was &s;u&s;pended: the whole a&s;&s;embly &s;tood &s;ome time motion|le&s;s, in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, which could not have been more &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed if they had di&s;covered that our friend's limbs had been &s;crewed on to the trunk; in a &s;hort time, however, the young women who were chafing us, re&s;umed their employment, and having continued it for about half an hour, they dre&s;&s;ed us again, but in this they were, as may ea&s;ily be imagined, very aukward; I found great bene|fit, however, from the chafing, and &s;o did the Lieutenant and Pur&s;er. After a little time, our generous benefactre&s;s ordered &s;ome bales of Indian cloth to be brought out, with which &s;he clothed me, and all that were with me, accord|ing to the fa&s;hion of the country. At fir&s;t I declined the ac|ceptance of this favour, but being unwilling not to &s;eem plea&s;ed with what was intended to plea&s;e me, I acquie&s;ced. When we went away, &s;he ordered a very large &s;ow, big with young, to be taken down to the boat, and accompanied us thither her&s;elf. She had given directions to her people to carry me, as they had done when I came, but as I cho&s;e rather to walk, &s;he took me by the arm, and whenever we came to a pla&s;h of water or dirt, &s;he lifted me over with as
<PB N="464" REF="302">
little trouble as it would have co&s;t me to have lifted over a child if I had been well.</P>
<P>The next morning I &s;ent her by the gunner,<MILESTONE N="Monday 13" UNIT="day"> &s;ix hatchets, &s;ix bill-hooks, and &s;everal other things; and when he re|turned, he told me that he found her giving an entertain|ment to a great number of people, which, he &s;uppo&s;ed, could not be le&s;s than a thou&s;and. The me&s;&s;es were all brought to her by the &s;ervants that prepared them, the meat being put into the &s;hells of cocoa nuts, and the &s;hells into wooden trays, &s;omewhat like tho&s;e u&s;ed by our but|chers, and &s;he di&s;tributed them with her own hands to the gue&s;ts, who were &s;eated in rows round the great hou&s;e. When this was done, &s;he &s;at down her&s;elf, upon a place &s;omewhat elevated above the re&s;t, and two women, placing them&s;elves one on each &s;ide of her, fed her, &s;he opening her mouth as they brought their hands up with the food. When &s;he &s;aw the gunner, &s;he ordered a me&s;s for him; he could not certainly tell what it was, but he believed it to be fowl picked &s;mall, with apples cut among it, and &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt water; it was, however, very well ta&s;ted. She ac|cepted the things that I &s;ent her, and &s;eemed to be much plea&s;ed with them. After this corre&s;pondence was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed with the queen, provi&s;ions of every kind became much more plenty at market; but though fowls and hogs were every day brought in, we were &s;till obliged to pay more for them than at the fir&s;t, the market having been &s;poiled by the nails which our men had &s;tolen and given to the women; I therefore gave orders that every man &s;hould be &s;earched before he went on &s;hore, and that no woman &s;hould be &s;uffered to cro&s;s the river.</P>
<P>On the 14th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 14" UNIT="day"> the gunner being on &s;hore to trade, per|ceived an old woman on the other &s;ide of the river, weeping

bitterly:<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 14" UNIT="day"> when &s;he &s;aw that &s;he had drawn his attention upon her, &s;he &s;ent a young man, who &s;tood by her, over the river to him, with a branch of the plantain tree in his hand. When he came up, he made a long &s;peech, and then laid down his bough at the gunner's feet: after this he went back and brought over the old woman, another man at the &s;ame time bringing over two large fat hogs. The woman looked round upon our people with great attention, fixing her eyes &s;ometimes upon one, and &s;ometimes upon another, and at la&s;t bur&s;t into tears. The young man who brought her over the river, perceiving the gunner's concern and a&s;toni&s;hment, made another &s;peech, longer than the fir&s;t: &s;till, however, the woman's di&s;tre&s;s was a my&s;tery, but at length &s;he made him under&s;tand that her hu&s;band, and three of her &s;ons, had been killed in the attack of the &s;hip. During this explanation, &s;he was to affected that at la&s;t &s;he &s;unk down unable to &s;peak, and the two young men, who endeavoured to &s;upport her, appeared to be nearly in the &s;ame condition: they were probably two more of her &s;ons, or &s;ome very near relations. The gunner did all in his power to &s;ooth and comfort her, and when &s;he had in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered her recollection, &s;he ordered the two hogs to be delivered to him, and gave him her hand in token of friend&s;hip, but would accept nothing in return, though he offered her ten times as much as would have purcha&s;ed the hogs at market.</P>
<P>The next morning, I &s;ent the Second Lieutenant,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> with all the boats, and &s;ixty men, to the we&s;tward, to look at the coun|try, and try what was to be got. About noon he returned, having marched along the &s;hore near &s;ix miles. He found the country very plea&s;ant and populous, and abounding as well with hogs and fowls, as fruit, and other vegetables of various kinds. The inhabitants offered him no mole&s;tation,
<PB N="466" REF="304">
but did not &s;eem willing to part with any of the provi&s;ions which our people were mo&s;t de&s;irous to purcha&s;e:<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> they gave them, however, a few cocoa-nuts and plantains, and at length &s;old them nine hogs and a few fowls. The Lieu|tenant was of opinion, that they might be brought to trade freely by degrees, but the di&s;tance from the &s;hip was &s;o great, that too many men would be nece&s;&s;ary for a guard. He &s;aw a great number of very large canoes upon the beach, and &s;ome that were building. He ob&s;erved that all their tools were made of &s;tone, &s;hells, and bone, and very ju&s;tly inferred, that they had no metal of any kind. He found no quadrupeds among them, be&s;ides hogs and dogs, nor any earthen ve&s;&s;el, &s;o that all their food is either baked or roa&s;ted. Having no ve&s;&s;el in which water could be &s;ubjected to the action of fire, they had no more idea that it could be made hot, than that it could be made &s;olid. As the queen was one morning at breakfa&s;t with us on board the &s;hip, one of her attendants, a man of &s;ome note, and one of tho&s;e that we thought were prie&s;ts, &s;aw the Surgeon fill the tea|pot by turning the cock of an urn that &s;tood upon the table: having remarked this with great curio&s;ity and attention, he pre&s;ently turned the cock, and received the water upon his hand: as &s;oon as he felt him&s;elf &s;calded, he roared out, and began to dance about the cabbin with the mo&s;t extravagant and ridiculous expre&s;&s;ions of pain and a&s;toni&s;hment: the other Indians, not being able to conceive what was the mat|ter with him, &s;tood &s;taring at him in amaze, and not with|out &s;ome mixture of terror. The Surgeon, however, who had innocently been the cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief, applied a re|medy, though it was &s;ome time before the poor fellow was ea&s;y.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 16th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> Mr. Furneaux, my Second Lieu|tenant, was taken very ill, which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me greatly, as

the gauntlet thrice round the deck:<MILESTONE N="Monday 20" UNIT="day"> my rhetoric, however, had very little effect, for mo&s;t of the crew being equally cri|minal with him&s;elf, he was handled &s;o tenderly, that others were rather encouraged to repeat the offence by the hope of impunity, than deterred by the fear of puni&s;hment. To pre&s;erve the &s;hip, therefore, from being pulled to pieces, and the price of refre&s;hments from being rai&s;ed &s;o high as &s;oon to exhau&s;t our articles of trade, I ordered that no man, except the wooders and waterers, with their guard, &s;hould be permitted to go on &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 21" UNIT="day"> the queen came again on board, and brought &s;everal large hogs as a pre&s;ent, for which, as u&s;ual, &s;he would accept of no return.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> An Account of an Expedition to di&s;cover the inland Part of the Country, and our other Tran&s;actions, till we quitted the I&s;land to continue our Voyage.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the mate came on board,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 25" UNIT="day"> he gave me a written account of his expedition, to the following effect:</P>
<P>"At four o'clock in the morning, of Saturday the 25th of June, I landed, with four mid&s;hipmen, a &s;erjeant and twelve marines, and twenty-four &s;eamen, all armed, be&s;ides four who carried hatchets and other articles of traffick, and four who were loaded with ammunition and provi&s;ions, the re&s;t being left with the boat: every man had his day's allowance of brandy, and the hatchet men two &s;mall kegs, to give out when I &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as I got on &s;hore, I called upon our old man, and took him with us: we then followed the cour&s;e of the river in two parties, one marching on each &s;ide. For the fir&s;t two miles it flowed through a valley of con&s;iderable width, in which were many habitations, with gardens walled in, and abundance of hogs, poultry, and fruit; the &s;oil here &s;eemed to be a rich fat earth, and was of a blacki&s;h colour. After this the valley became very narrow, and the ground ri&s;ing abruptly on one &s;ide of the river, we were all obliged to march on the other. Where the &s;tream was precipitated from the hills, channels had been cut to lead the water into gardens and plantations of fruit trees: in the&s;e gardens we found an herb which had never been brought down to the
<PB N="473" REF="311">
water-&s;ide, and which we perceived the inhabitants eat raw.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 25" UNIT="day"> I ta&s;ted it, and found it plea&s;ant, its flavour &s;omewhat re|&s;embling that of the We&s;t Indian &s;pinnage, called <HI>Calleloor,</HI> though its leaf was very different. The ground was fenced off &s;o as to make a very pretty appearance; the bread-fruit and apple trees were planted in rows on the declivity of the hills, and the cocoa nut and plantain, which require more moi&s;ture, on the level ground: under the trees, both on the &s;ides and at the foot of the hills, there was very good gra&s;s, but no underwood. As we advanced, the windings of the &s;tream became innumerable, the hills on each &s;ide &s;welled into mountains, and va&s;t crags every where projected over our heads. Travelling now became difficult, and when we had proceeded about four miles, the road for the la&s;t mile having been very bad, we &s;at down to re&s;t our&s;elves, and take the refre&s;hment of our breakfa&s;t; we ranged our|&s;elves upon the ground under a large apple tree, in a very plea&s;ant &s;pot; but ju&s;t as we were about to begin our repa&s;t, we were &s;uddenly alarmed by a confu&s;ed &s;ound of many voices, and a great &s;houting, and pre&s;ently afterwards &s;aw a multitude of men, women, and children upon the hill above us; our old man &s;eeing us ri&s;e ha&s;tily, and look to our arms, beckoned to us to &s;it &s;till, and immediately went up to the people that had &s;urpri&s;ed us. As &s;oon as he joined them they were &s;ilent, and &s;oon after di&s;appeared; in a &s;hort time, however, they returned, and brought with them a large hog ready roa&s;ted, with plenty of bread-fruit, yams, and other refre&s;hments, which they gave to the old man, who di&s;tributed them among our people. In return for this treat, I gave them &s;ome nails, buttons, and other things, with which they were greatly delighted. After this we proceeded up the valley as far as we could, &s;earching all the runs of water, and all the places where water had run, for
<PB N="474" REF="312">
appearances of metal or ore,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 25" UNIT="day"> but could find none, except what I have brought back with me. I &s;hewed all the people that we met with, the piece of &s;altpetre which had been picked up in the i&s;land, and which I had taken with me for that purpo&s;e, but none of them took any notice of it, nor could I learn from them any thing about it. The old man began now to be weary, and there being a mountain before us, he made &s;igns that he would go home: before he left us, however, he made the people who had &s;o liberally &s;upplied us with provi&s;ions, take the baggage, with the fruit that had not been eaten, and &s;ome cocoa nut-&s;hells full of fre&s;h water, and made &s;igns that they &s;hould follow us up the &s;ide of the mountain. As &s;oon as he was gone, they gathered green branches from the neighbouring trees, and with many ceremonies, of which we did not know the meaning, laid them down before us: after this they took &s;ome &s;mall berries with which they painted them&s;elves red, and the bark of a tree that contained a yellow juice, with which they &s;tained their garments in different parts. We began to climb the mountain while our old man was &s;till in &s;ight, and he, perceiving that we made our way with difficulty through the weeds and bru&s;h-wood, which grew very thick, turned back, and &s;aid &s;omething to the natives in a firm loud tone; upon which twenty or thirty of the men went before us, and cleared us a very good path; they al&s;o re|fre&s;hed us with water and fruit as we went along, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us to climb the mo&s;t difficult places, which we &s;hould otherwi&s;e have found altogether impracticable. We began to a&s;cend this hill at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix miles from the place where we landed, and I reckoned the top of it to be near a mile above the river that runs through the valley below. When we arrived at the &s;ummit, we again &s;at down to re&s;t and refre&s;h our&s;elves. While we were
<PB N="475" REF="313">
climbing we flattered our&s;elves that from the top we &s;hould command the whole i&s;land,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 25" UNIT="day"> but we now &s;aw mountains before us &s;o much higher than our &s;ituation, that with re&s;pect to them we appeared to be in a valley; towards the &s;hip indeed the view was enchanting: the &s;ides of the hills were beautifully clothed with wood, villages were every where inter&s;per&s;ed, and the vallies between them afforded a &s;till richer pro&s;pect; the hou&s;es &s;tood thicker, and the ver|dure was more luxuriant. We &s;aw very few habitations above us, but di&s;covered &s;moke in many places a&s;cending from between the highe&s;t hills that were in &s;ight, and there|fore I conjecture that the mo&s;t elevated parts of the country are by no means without inhabitants. As we a&s;cended the mountain, we &s;aw many &s;prings gu&s;h from fi&s;&s;ures on the &s;ide of it, and when we had reached the &s;ummit, we found many hou&s;es that we did not di&s;cover as we pa&s;&s;ed them. No part of the&s;e mountains is naked; the &s;ummits of the highe&s;t that we could &s;ee were crowned with wood, but of what kind I know not: tho&s;e that were of the &s;ame height with that which we had climbed, were woody on the &s;ides, but on the &s;ummit were rocky and covered with fern. Upon the flats that appeared below the&s;e, there grew a &s;edgy kind of gra&s;s and weeds: in general the &s;oil here, as well as in the valley, &s;eemed to be rich. We &s;aw &s;everal bu&s;hes of &s;ugar-cane, which was very large and very good, growing wild, without the lea&s;t culture. I likewi&s;e found ginger and turmerick, and have brought &s;amples of both, but could not procure &s;eeds of any tree, mo&s;t of them being in blo&s;&s;om. After traver&s;ing the top of this mountain to a good di&s;tance, I found a tree exactly like a fern, except that it was 14 or 15 feet high. This tree I cut down, and found the in|&s;ide of it al&s;o like a fern: I would have brought a piece of it with me, but found it too cumber&s;ome, and I knew not
<PB N="476" REF="314">
what difficulties we might meet with before we got back to the &s;hip,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 25" UNIT="day"> which we judged to be now at a great di&s;tance. After having again recruited our &s;trength by refre&s;hment and re&s;t, we began to de&s;cend the mountain, being &s;till attended by the people to who&s;e care we had been recom|mended by our old man. We kept our general direction to|wards the &s;hip, but &s;ometimes deviated a little to the right and left in the plains and vallies, when we &s;aw any hou&s;es that were plea&s;antly &s;ituated, the inhabitants being every where ready to accommodate us with whatever they had. We &s;aw no bea&s;t, except a few hogs, nor any birds, ex|cept parrots, parroquets, and green doves; by the river, however, there was plenty of ducks, and every place that was planted and cultivated, appeared to flouri&s;h with great luxuriance, though in the mid&s;t of what had the appearance of barren ground. I planted the &s;tones of peaches, cherries, and plums, with a great variety of garden &s;eeds, where I thought it was mo&s;t probable that they would thrive, and limes, lemons, and oranges, in &s;ituations which re&s;embled tho&s;e in which they are found in the We&s;t Indies. In the afternoon, we arrived at a very plea&s;ant &s;pot, within about three miles of the &s;hip, where we procured two hogs and &s;ome fowls, which the natives dre&s;&s;ed for us very well, and with great expedition. Here we continued till the cool of the evening, and then made the be&s;t of our way for the &s;hip, having liberally rewarded our guides, and the people who had provided us &s;o good a dinner. Our men behaved through the whole day with the greate&s;t decency and order, and we parted with our Indian friends in perfect good-hu|mour with each other."</P>
<P>About 10 o'clock,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 26" UNIT="day"> the next morning, the queen came on board according to her promi&s;e, with a pre&s;ent of hogs and fowls, but went on &s;hore again &s;oon afterwards. This day,
<PB N="477" REF="315">
the Gunner &s;ent off near thirty hogs,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 26" UNIT="day"> with great plenty of fowls and fruit. We completed our wood and water, and got all ready for &s;ea. More inhabitants came down to the beach, from the inland country, than we had &s;een before, and many of them appeared, by the re&s;pect that was paid them, to be of a &s;uperior rank. About three o'clock in the afternoon, the queen came again down to the beach, very well dre&s;&s;ed, and followed by a great number of people. Having cro&s;&s;ed the river with her attendants and our old man, &s;he came once more on board the &s;hip. She brought with her &s;ome very fine fruit, and renewed her &s;olicitation, that I would &s;tay ten days longer, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, intimating that &s;he would go into the country, and bring me plenty of hogs, fowls, and fruit. I endeavoured to ex|pre&s;s a proper &s;en&s;e of her kindne&s;s and bounty, but a&s;&s;ured her that I &s;hould certainly &s;ail the next morning. This, as u&s;ual, threw her into tears, and after &s;he recovered, &s;he en|quired by &s;igns when I &s;hould return: I endeavoured to ex|pre&s;s fifty days, and &s;he made &s;igns for thirty: but the &s;ign for fifty being con&s;tantly repeated, &s;he &s;eemed &s;atisfied. She &s;tayed on board till night, and it was then with the greate&s;t difficulty that &s;he could be prevailed upon to go on &s;hore. When &s;he was told that the boat was ready, &s;he threw her&s;elf down upon the arm-che&s;t, and wept a long time with an exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion that could not be pacified; at la&s;t, however, though with the greate&s;t reluctance, &s;he went into the boat, and was followed by her attendants and the old man. The old man had often intimated that his &s;on, a lad about fourteen years of age, &s;hould go with us, and the boy &s;eemed to be willing: he had, however, now di&s;appeared for two days; I enquired after him when I fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ed him, and the old man gave me to under&s;tand that he was gone into the country to &s;ee his friends, and would return time
<PB N="478" REF="316">
enough to go with us; <MILESTONE N="Sunday 26" UNIT="day"> but I have rea&s;on to think that, when the time drew near, the father's courage failed, and that to keep his child he &s;ecreted him till the &s;hip was gone, for we never &s;aw him afterwards.</P>
<P>At break of day, on Monday the 27th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 27" UNIT="day"> we unmoored, and at the &s;ame time I &s;ent the barge and cutter to fill the few water-ca&s;ks that were now empty. When they came near the &s;hore, they &s;aw, to their great &s;urpri&s;e, the whole beach covered with inhabitants, and having &s;ome doubt whether it would be prudent to venture them&s;elves among &s;uch a mul|titude, they were about to pull back again for the &s;hip. As &s;oon as this was perceived from the &s;hore, the queen came forward, and beckoned them; at the &s;ame time gue&s;&s;ing the rea&s;on of what had happened, &s;he made the natives retire to the other &s;ide of the river: the boats then proceeded to the &s;hore, and filled the ca&s;ks, in the mean time &s;he put &s;ome hogs and fruit on board, and when they were putting off would fain have returned with them to the &s;hip. The offi|cer, however, who had received orders to bring off none of the natives, would not permit her; upon which &s;he pre&s;ently launched a double canoe, and was rowed off by her own people. Her canoe was immediately followed by fifteen or &s;ixteen more, and all of them came up to the &s;hip. The queen came on board, but not being able to &s;peak, &s;he &s;at down and gave vent to her pa&s;&s;ion by weeping. After &s;he had been on board about an hour, a breeze &s;pringing up, we weighed anchor and made &s;ail. Finding it now nece&s;&s;ary to return into her canoe, &s;he embraced us all in the mo&s;t affectionate manner, and with many tears; all her attend|ants al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed great &s;orrow at our departure. Soon after it fell calm, and I &s;ent the boats a-head to tow, upon which all the canoes returned to the &s;hip, and that which had the queen on board came up to the gun-room port, where her

About 10 o'clock we were got without the reef, and a fre&s;h breeze &s;pringing up, our Indian friends, and particularly the queen, once more bade us farewel, with &s;uch tenderne&s;s of affec|tion and grief, as filled both my heart and my eyes.</P>

<P>The inhabitants of this i&s;land are a &s;tout, well-made, active, and comely people.

The complexion of the men is tawney, but tho&s;e that go upon the water are much redder than tho&s;e who live on &s;hore. Their hair in general is black, but in &s;ome it is brown, in &s;ome red, and in others flaxen, which is remarkable, becau&s;e the hair of all other natives of A&s;ia, Africa, and America, is black, with|out a &s;ingle exception.

Cha&s;tity does not &s;eem to be con|&s;idered as a virtue among them, for they not only readily and openly trafficked with our people for per&s;onal favours, but were brought down by their fathers and brothers for that purpo&s;e: they were, however, con&s;cious of the value of beauty, and the &s;ize of the nail that was demanded for the enjoyment of the lady, was always in proportion to her charms. The men who came down to the &s;ide of the river, at the &s;ame time that they pre&s;ented the girl, &s;hewed a &s;tick of the &s;ize of the nail that was to be her price, and if our people agreed, &s;he was &s;ent over to them, for the men were not permitted to cro&s;s the river. This commerce was car|ried on a con&s;iderable time before the officers di&s;covered it, for while &s;ome &s;traggled a little way to receive the lady, the others kept a look-out. When I was acquainted with it, I no longer wondered that the &s;hip was in danger of being pulled to pieces for the nails and iron that held her together, which I had before puzzled my&s;elf to account for in vain, the whole &s;hip's company having daily as much fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ion and fruit as they could eat. Both men and women are not only decently but gracefully clothed, in a kind of white cloth, that is made of the bark of a &s;hrub, and very much re&s;embles coar&s;e China paper. Their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of two pieces of this cloth: one of them, a hole having been made in the middle to put the head through, hangs down from the &s;houlders to the mid-leg before and behind; an|other piece, which is between four and five yards long, and about one yard broad, they wrap round the body in a very ea&s;y manner. This cloth is not woven, but is made, like paper, of the macerated fibres of an inner bark, &s;pread out and beaten together. Their ornaments are feathers, flowers,
<PB N="482" REF="320">
pieces of &s;hells, and pearls the pearls are worn chiefly by the women, from whom I purcha&s;ed about two dozen of a &s;mall &s;ize: they were of a good colour, but were all &s;poiled by boring. Mr. Furneaux &s;aw &s;everal in his excur&s;ion to the we&s;t, but he could purcha&s;e none with any thing he had to offer. I ob&s;erved, that it was here a univer&s;al cu&s;tom both for men and women to have the hinder part of their thighs and loins marked very thick with black lines in various forms. The&s;e marks were made by &s;triking the teeth of an in&s;trument, &s;omewhat like a comb, ju&s;t through the &s;kin, and rubbing into the punctures a kind of pa&s;te made of foot and oil, which leaves an indelible &s;tain. The boys and girls under twelve years of age, are not marked; but we ob|&s;erved a few of the men who&s;e legs were marked in che|quers by the &s;ame method, and they appeared to be per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank and authority. One of the principal attend|ants upon the queen, appeared much more di&s;po&s;ed to imi|tate our manners than the re&s;t; and our people, with whom he &s;oon became a favourite, di&s;tingui&s;hed him by the name of Jonathan. This man, Mr. Furneaux clothed completely in an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, and it &s;at very ea&s;y upon him. Our officers were always carried on &s;hore, it being &s;hoal water where we landed, and Jonathan, a&s;&s;uming new &s;tate with his new finery, made &s;ome of his people carry him on &s;hore in the &s;ame manner. He very &s;oon attempted to u&s;e a knife and fork at his meals, but at fir&s;t, when he had &s;tuck a mor|&s;el upon his fork, and tried to feed him&s;elf with that in&s;tru|ment, he could not guide it, but by the mere force of habit his hand came to his mouth, and the victuals at the end of the fork went away to his car.</P>
<P>Their food con&s;i&s;ts of pork, poultry, dog's fle&s;h, and fi&s;h, bread-fruit, bananas, plantains, yams, apples, and a four fruit which, though not plea&s;ant by it&s;elf, gives an agree|able
<PB N="483" REF="321">
reli&s;h to roa&s;ted bread-fruit, with which it is frequently beaten up. They have abundance of rats, but, as far as I could di&s;cover, the&s;e make no part of their food. The river affords them good mullet, but they are neither large nor in plenty. They find conchs, mu&s;cles, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h on the reef, which they gather at low water, and eat raw with bread-fruit before they come on &s;hore. They have al&s;o very fine cray-fi&s;h, and they catch with lines, and hooks of mother of pearl, at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore, parrot|fi&s;h, groopers, and many other &s;orts, of which they are &s;o fond that we could &s;eldom prevail upon them to &s;ell us a few at any price. They have al&s;o nets of an enormous &s;ize, with very &s;mall me&s;hes, and with the&s;e they catch abun|dance of &s;mall fi&s;h about the &s;ize of &s;ardines; but while they were u&s;ing both nets and lines with great &s;ucce&s;s, we could not catch a &s;ingle fi&s;h with either. We procured &s;ome of their hooks and lines, but for want of their art we were &s;till di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The manner in which they dre&s;s their food is this: they kindle a fire by rubbing the end of one piece of dry wood upon the &s;ide of another, in the &s;ame manner as our carpen|ters whet a chi&s;&s;el; then they dig a pit about half a foot deep, and two or three yards in circumference: they pave the bottom with large pebble &s;tones, which they lay down very &s;mooth and even, and then kindle a fire in it with dry wood, leaves, and the hu&s;ks of the cocoa-nut. When the &s;tones are &s;ufficiently heated, they take out the embers, and rake up the a&s;hes on every &s;ide; then they cover the &s;tones with a layer of green cocoa-nut-tree leaves, and wrap up the animal that is to be dre&s;&s;ed in the leaves of the plantain; if it is a &s;mall hog they wrap it up whole, if a large one they &s;plit it. When it is placed in the pit, they cover it with the hot em|bers, and lay upon them bread-fruit and yams, which are
<PB N="484" REF="322">
al&s;o wrapped up in the leaves of the plantain; over the&s;e they &s;pread the remainder of the embers, mixing among them &s;ome of the hot &s;tones, with more cocoa-nut-tree leaves upon them, and then clo&s;e all up with earth, &s;o that the heat is kept in. After a time proportioned to the &s;ize of what is dre&s;&s;ing, the oven is opened, and the meat taken out, which is tender, full of gravy, and, in my opinion, better in every re&s;pect than when it is dre&s;&s;ed any other way. Excepting the fruit, they have no &s;auce but &s;alt water, nor any knives but &s;hells, with which they carve very dexte|rou&s;ly, always cutting from them. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the a&s;toni&s;hment they expre&s;&s;ed when they &s;aw the Gunner, who, while he kept the market, u&s;ed to dine on &s;hore, dre&s;s his pork and poultry by boiling them in a pot, having, as I have before ob&s;erved, no ve&s;&s;el that would bear the fire, they had no idea of hot water or its effects: but from the time that the old man was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an iron pot, he and his friends eat boiled meat every day. The iron pots which I afterwards gave to the queen, and &s;everal of the Chiefs, were al&s;o in con&s;tant u&s;e, and brought as many people together, as a mon&s;ter or a puppet-&s;how in a country fair. They appeared to have no liquor for drinking but water, and to be happily ignorant of the art of fermenting the juice of any vegetable, &s;o as to give it an intoxicating quality: they have, as has been already ob&s;erved, the &s;ugar|cane, but they &s;eemed to make no other u&s;e of it than to chew, which they do not do habitually, but only break a piece off when they happen to pa&s;s by a place where it is growing.</P>
<P>Of their dome&s;tic life and amu&s;ements, we had not &s;uffi|cient opportunity to obtain much knowlege, but they appear &s;ometimes to have wars with each other, not only from their weapons, but the &s;cars with which many of them were
<PB N="485" REF="323">
marked, and &s;ome of which appeared to be the remains of very con&s;iderable wounds, made with &s;tones, bludgeons, or &s;ome other obtu&s;e weapon: by the&s;e &s;cars al&s;o they appear to be no incon&s;iderable proficients in &s;urgery, of which indeed we happened to have more direct evidence. One of our &s;ea|men, when he was on &s;hore, run a large &s;plinter into his foot, and the Surgeon being on board, one of his comrades endeavoured to take it out with a penknife; but after putting the poor fellow to a good deal of pain, was obliged to give it over. Our good old Indian, who happened to be pre&s;ent, then called over one of his countrymen that was &s;tanding on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, who having looked at the &s;eaman's foot, went immediately down to the beach, and taking up a &s;hell, broke it to a point with his teeth; with this in&s;trument, in little more than a minute, he laid open the place, and extracted the &s;plinter; in the mean time the old man, who, as &s;oon as he had called the other over, went a little way into the wood, returned with &s;ome gum, which he applied to the wound upon a piece of the cloth that was wrapped round him, and in two days time it was perfectly healed. We afterwards learned that this gum was produced by the apple tree, and our Surgeon procured &s;ome of it, and u&s;ed it as a vulnerary bal&s;am with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The habitations of the&s;e happy people I have de&s;cribed already; and be&s;ides the&s;e, we &s;aw &s;everal &s;heds inclo&s;ed within a wall, on the out&s;ide of which there were &s;everal uncouth figures of men, women, hogs, and dogs, carved on po&s;ts, that were driven into the ground. Several of the na|tives were from time to time &s;een to enter the&s;e places, with a &s;low pace and dejected countenance, from which we con|jectured that they were repo&s;itories of the dead. The area within the walls of the&s;e places, was generally well paved
<PB N="486" REF="324">
with large round &s;tones, but it appeared not to be much trodden, for the gra&s;s every where grew up between them. I endeavoured, with particular attention, to di&s;cover whether they had a religious wor&s;hip among them, but never could find the lea&s;t traces of any.</P>
<P>The boats or canoes of the&s;e people, are of three different &s;orts. Some are made out of a &s;ingle tree, and carry from two to &s;ix men: the&s;e are u&s;ed chiefly for fi&s;hing, and we con&s;tantly &s;aw many of them bu&s;y upon the reef: &s;ome were con&s;tructed of planks, very dexterou&s;ly &s;ewed together: the&s;e were of different &s;izes, and would carry from ten to forty men. Two of them were generally la&s;hed together, and two ma&s;ts &s;et up between them; if they were &s;ingle, they had an out-rigger on one &s;ide, and only one ma&s;t in the middle. With the&s;e ve&s;&s;els they &s;ail far beyond the &s;ight of land, probably to other i&s;lands, and bring home plantains, bananas, and yams, which &s;eem al&s;o to be more plenty upon other parts of this i&s;land, than that off which the &s;hip lay. A third &s;ort &s;eem to be intended principally for plea|&s;ure and &s;how: they are very large, but have no &s;ail, and in &s;hape re&s;emble the gondolas of Venice: the middle is covered with a large awning, and &s;ome of the people &s;it upon it, &s;ome under it. None of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els came near the &s;hip, except on the fir&s;t and &s;econd day after our arrival; but we &s;aw, three or four times a week, a proce&s;&s;ion of eight or ten of them pa&s;&s;ing at a di&s;tance, with &s;treamers flying, and a great number of &s;mall canoes attending them, while many hundreds of people ran abrea&s;t of them along the &s;hore. They generally rowed to the outward point of a reef which lay about four miles to the we&s;tward of us, where they &s;tayed about an hour, and then returned. The&s;e proce&s;|&s;ions, however, are never made but in fine weather, and all
<PB N="487" REF="325">
the people on board are dre&s;&s;ed; though in the other canoes they have only a piece of cloth wrapped round their middle. Tho&s;e who rowed and &s;teered were dre&s;&s;ed in white; tho&s;e who &s;at upon the awning and under it in white and red, and two men who were mounted on the prow of each ve&s;&s;el, were dre&s;&s;ed in red only. We &s;ometimes went out to ob&s;erve them in our boats, and though we were never nearer than a mile, we &s;aw them with our gla&s;&s;es as di&s;tinctly as if we had been upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The plank of which the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are con&s;tructed, is made by &s;plitting a tree, with the grain, into as many thin pieces as they can. They fir&s;t fell the tree with a kind of hatchet, or adze, made of a tough greeni&s;h kind of &s;tone, very dex|terou&s;ly fitted into a handle; it is then cut into &s;uch lengths as are required for the plank, one end of which is heated till it begins to crack, and then with wedges of hard wood they &s;plit it down: &s;ome of the&s;e planks are two feet broad, and from 15 to 20 feet long. The &s;ides are &s;moothed with adzes of the &s;ame materials and con&s;truction, but of a &s;maller &s;ize. Six or eight men are &s;ometimes at work upon the &s;ame plank together, and, as their tools pre&s;ently lo&s;e their edge, every man has by him a cocoa nut-&s;hell filled with water, and a flat &s;tone, with which he &s;harpens his adze almo&s;t every minute. The&s;e planks are generally brought to the thickne&s;s of about an inch, and are after|wards fitted to the boat with the &s;ame exactne&s;s that would be expected from an expert joiner. To fa&s;ten the&s;e planks together, holes are bored with a piece of bone that is fixed into a &s;tick for that purpo&s;e, a u&s;e to which our nails were afterwards applied with great advantage, and through the&s;e holes a kind of plaited cordage is pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to hold the planks &s;trongly together: the &s;eams are caulked with dried ru&s;hes, and the whole out&s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el is paid with a
<PB N="488" REF="326">
gummy juice, which &s;ome of their trees produce in great plenty, and which is a very good &s;uccedaneum for pitch.</P>
<P>The wood which they u&s;e for their large canoes, is that of the apple tree, which grows very tall and &s;trait. Several of them that we mea&s;ured, were near eight feet in the girth, and from 20 to 40 to the branches, with very little di|minution in the &s;ize. Our carpenter &s;aid, that in other re&s;pects it was not a good wood for the purpo&s;e, being very light. The &s;mall canoes are nothing more than the hol|lowed trunk of the bread-fruit tree, which is &s;till more light and &s;pongy. The trunk of the bread-fruit tree is &s;ix feet in girth, and about 20 feet to the branches.</P>
<P>Their principal weapons are &s;tones, thrown either with the hand or &s;ling, and bludgeons; for though they have bows and arrows, the arrows are only fit to knock down a bird, none of them being pointed, but headed only with a round &s;tone.</P>
<P>I did not &s;ee one turtle all the while I lay off this i&s;land, but upon &s;hewing &s;ome &s;mall ones which I brought from Queen Charlotte's I&s;land, to the inhabitants, they made &s;igns that they had them of a much larger &s;ize. I very much re|gretted my having lo&s;t our he-goat, which died &s;oon after we left Saint Iago, and that neither of our &s;he-goats, of which we had two, were with kid. If the he-goat had lived, I would have put them all on &s;hore at this place, and I would have left a &s;he-goat here if either of them had been with kid; and I doubt not, but that in a few years they would have &s;tocked the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The climate here appears to be very good, and the i&s;land to be one of the mo&s;t healthy as well as delightful &s;pots in the world. We &s;aw no appearance of di&s;ea&s;e among the in|habitants. The hills are covered with wood, and the vallies
<PB N="489" REF="327">
with herbage; and the air in general is &s;o pure, that, not|with&s;tanding the heat, our fle&s;h meat kept very well two days, and our fi&s;h one. We met with no frog, toad, &s;cor|pion, centipied, or &s;erpent of any kind: and the only trouble|&s;ome in&s;ects that we &s;aw were ants, of which there were but few.</P>
<P>The &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land &s;eems to be better culti|vated and inhabited than where we lay, for we &s;aw every day boats come round from thence laden with plantains and other fruit, and we always found greater plenty, and a lower price, &s;oon after their arrival, than before.</P>
<P>The tide ri&s;es and falls very little, and being governed by the winds, is very uncertain; though they generally blow from the E. to the S. S. E. and for the mo&s;t part a plea&s;ant breeze.</P>
<P>The benefit that we received while we lay off this i&s;land, with re&s;pect to the health of the &s;hip's company, was beyond our mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, for we had not now an in|valid on board, except the two Lieutenants and my&s;elf, and we were recovering, though &s;till in a very feeble condition.</P>
<P>It is certain that none of our people contracted the venereal di&s;ea&s;e here, and therefore, as they had free commerce with great numbers of the women, there is the greate&s;t pro|bability that it was not then known in the country. It was, however, found here by Captain Cook, in the Endeavour, and as no European ve&s;&s;el is known to have vi&s;ited this i&s;land before Captain Cook's arrival, but the Dolphin, and the Boudeu&s;e and Etoil, commanded by M. Bougainville, the re|proach of having contaminated with that dreadful pe&s;t, a race of happy people, to whom its mi&s;eries had till then been unknown, mu&s;t be due either to him or to me, to Eng|land or to France; and I think my&s;elf happy to be able to exculpate my&s;elf and my country beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="328">It is well known, that the Surgeon on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips keeps a li&s;t of the per&s;ons who are &s;ick on board, &s;pe|cifying their di&s;ea&s;es, and the times when they came under his care, and when they were di&s;charged. It happened that I was once at the pay-table on board a &s;hip, when &s;everal &s;ail|ors objected to the payment of the Surgeon, alleging, that although he had di&s;charged them from the li&s;t, and reported them to be cured, yet their cure was incomplete. From this time, it has been my con&s;tant practice when the Surgeon re|ported a man to be cured, who had been upon the &s;ick li&s;t, to call the man before me, and a&s;k him whether the report was true: if he alleged that any &s;ymptoms of his complaint remained, I continued him upon the li&s;t; if not, I required him, as a confirmation of the Surgeon's report, to &s;ign the book, which was always done in my pre&s;ence. A copy of the &s;ick li&s;t on board the Dolphin, during this voyage, &s;igned by every man in my pre&s;ence, when he was di&s;charged well, in confirmation of the Surgeon's report, written in my own hand, and confirmed by my affidavit, I have depo&s;ited in the Admiralty; by which it appears, that the la&s;t man on board the &s;hip, in her voyage outward, who was upon the &s;ick li&s;t for the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, except one who was &s;ent to England in the Store &s;hip, was di&s;charged cured, and &s;igned the book on the 27th of December 1766, near &s;ix months before our arrival at Otaheite, which was on the 19th of June 1767; and that the fir&s;t man who was upon the li&s;t for that di&s;ea&s;e, in our return home, was entered on the 26th of February 1768, &s;ix months after we left the i&s;land, which was on the 26th of July 1767, &s;o that the &s;hip's company was intirely free four|teen months within one day, the very middle of which time we &s;pent at Otaheite; and the man who was fir&s;t entered as a venereal patient, on our return home, was known to have contracted the di&s;ea&s;e at the Cape of Good Hope, where we then lay.</P>

<P>HAVING made &s;ail from King George the Third's I&s;land,<MILESTONE N="Monday 27" UNIT="day"> we proceeded along the &s;hore of the Duke of York's I&s;land, at the di&s;tance of about two miles. There ap|peared to be good bays in every part of it, and in the middle a fine harbour; but I did not think it worth while to go on &s;hore. The middle and we&s;t end is very mountainous, the ea&s;t end is lower, and the coa&s;t ju&s;t within the beach is covered with cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, apple, and plantain trees.</P>
<P>At day-light, the next morning, we &s;aw land,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 28" UNIT="day"> for which we made &s;ail, and ran along the lee-&s;ide of it. On the wea|ther-&s;ide there were very great breakers, and the lee-&s;ide was rocky, but in many places there appeared to be good an|chorage. We &s;aw but few inhabitants, and they appeared to live in a manner very different from tho&s;e of King George's I&s;land, their habitations being only &s;mall huts. We &s;aw many cocoa-nut and other trees upon the &s;hore; but all of them had their heads blown away, probably in a hur|ricane. This i&s;land is about &s;ix miles long, and has a moun|tain of con&s;iderable height in the middle, which &s;eems to be fertile. It lies in latitude 17&deg; 28&prime; S. and longitude, by our la&s;t ob&s;ervation, 151&deg; 4&prime; W. and I called it SIR CHARLES SAUNDERS's ISLAND.<MILESTONE N="Sir Charles Saunders's I&s;land" UNIT="place"></P>
<P>On the 29th, the variation of the compa&s;s, by azimuth,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 29" UNIT="day"> was 7&deg; 52&prime; E.; and early the next morning, at day-break,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 30" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw land bearing from N. by E. to N.

by breakers.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 30" UNIT="day"> We &s;aw &s;moke in two places, but no inhabitants. A few cocoa-nut trees were growing on the lee-part of it, and I called it LORD HOW's ISLAND.<MILESTONE N="Lord How's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> It is about ten miles long, and four broad, and lies in latitude 16&deg; 46&prime; S. longitude, by ob&s;ervation, 154&deg; 13&prime; W.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we &s;aw land bearing W. by N. and &s;tood for it. At five o'clock, we &s;aw breakers running a great way out to the &s;outhward, and &s;oon after, low land to the S. W. and breakers all about it in every direction.</P>
<P>We turned to windward all night, and as &s;oon as it was light, crowded &s;ail to get round the&s;e &s;hoals. At nine we got round them, and named them SCILLY ISLANDS.<MILESTONE N="Scilly I&s;lands" UNIT="place"> They are a group of i&s;lands or &s;hoals extremely dangerous; for in the night, however clear the weather, and by day, if it is hazey, a &s;hip may run upon them without &s;eeing land. They lie in latitude 16&deg; 28&prime; S. longitude 155&deg; 30&prime; W.</P>

At 11 o'clock in the forenoon, we &s;aw more land in the W. S. W. At noon, the fir&s;t land that we &s;aw, which proved to be an i&s;land, bore W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant about five leagues, and had the appearance of a &s;ugar loaf; the middle of the other land, which was al&s;o an i&s;land, and appeared in a peak, bore W. S. W. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues. To the fir&s;t, which is nearly circular, and three miles over, I gave the name of BOSCAWEN's ISLAND; <MILESTONE N="Bo&s;cawen's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> and the other, which is three miles and a half long, and two broad, I called KEPPEL's ISLE.<MILESTONE N="Keppel's I&s;le" UNIT="place"> Port Royal at this time bore E. 4&deg; 10&prime; S. di&s;tant 478 leagues.</P>
<P>At two o'clock, being about two miles di&s;tant from Bo&s;|cawen's I&s;land, we &s;aw &s;everal of the inhabitants; but Kep|pel's I&s;le being to windward, and appearing more likely to afford us anchorage, we hauled up for it. At &s;ix, it was not
<PB N="493" REF="332">
more than a mile and an half di&s;tant, and, with our gla&s;&s;es,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw many of the inhabitants upon the beach; but there being breakers at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore, we &s;tood off and on all night.</P>
<P>At four o'clock the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Friday 14" UNIT="day"> we &s;ent off the boats to &s;ound, and vi&s;it the i&s;land; and as &s;oon as it was light, we ran down and lay over-again&s;t the middle of it. At noon, the boats returned, and reported that they had run within a cable's length of the i&s;land, but could find no ground: that &s;eeing a reef of rocks lie off it, they had hauled round it, and got into a large deep bay which was full of rocks: that they then &s;ounded without the bay, and found anchorage from 14 to 20 fathom, with a bottom of &s;and and coral: that afterwards they went again into the bay, and found a rivu|let of good water, but the &s;hore being rocky, went in &s;earch of a better landing-place, which they found about half a mile farther, and went a&s;hore. They reported al&s;o, that from the water to this landing-place, a good rolling-way might be made for &s;upplying the &s;hip, but that a &s;trong guard would be nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent mole&s;tation from the inhabitants. They &s;aw no hogs, but brought off two fowls and &s;ome cocoa-nuts, plantains and bananas. While the boats were on &s;hore, two canoes came up to them with &s;ix men: they &s;eemed to be peaceably inclined, and were much the &s;ame kind of people as the inhabitants, of King George's I&s;land, but they were clothed in a kind of matting, and the fir&s;t joint of their little fingers had been taken off; at the &s;ame time about fifty more came down from the country, to within about an hundred yards of them, but would advance no farther. When our people had made what ob&s;ervations they could, they put off, and three of the natives from the canoes came into one of the boats, but when &s;he got about half a mile from the &s;hore, they all &s;uddenly jumped over|board and &s;wam back again.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="333">Having received this account,<MILESTONE N="Friday 14" UNIT="day"> I con&s;idered that the water|ing here would be tedious, and attended with great fatigue: that it was now the depth of winter in the &s;outhern hemi|&s;phere, that the &s;hip was leaky, that the rudder &s;hook the &s;tern very much, and that what other damage &s;he might have received in her bottom could not be known. That for the&s;e rea&s;ons, &s;he was very unfit for the bad weather which &s;he would certainly meet with either in going round Cape Horn, or through the Streight of Magellan: that if &s;he &s;hould get &s;afely through the Streight, or round the Cape, it would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her to refre&s;h in &s;ome port, but in that ca&s;e no port would be in her reach; I therefore determined to make the be&s;t of my way to Tinian, Batavia, and &s;o to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope. By this rout, as far as we could judge, we &s;hould &s;ooner be at home; and if the &s;hip &s;hould prove not to be in a condition to make the whole voyage, we &s;hould &s;till &s;ave our lives, as from this place to Batavia we &s;hould probably have a calm &s;ea, and be not far from as port.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, at noon I bore away, and pa&s;&s;ed Bo&s;cawen's I&s;land without vi&s;iting it. It is a high round i&s;land, abounding in wood, and full of people; but Keppel's I&s;le is by far the large&s;t and the be&s;t of the two.</P>
<P>Bo&s;cawen's I&s;land lies in latitude 15&deg; 50&prime; S. longitude 175&deg; W. and Keppel's I&s;le in latitude 15&deg; 55&prime; S. longitude 175&deg; 3&prime; W.</P>
<P>We continued a W. N. W. cour&s;e till 10 o'clock in the morning of Sunday the 16th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 16" UNIT="day"> when we &s;aw land bearing N. by E. and hauled up for it. At noon, we were within three leagues of it: the land within &s;hore appeared to be high, but at the water-&s;ide it was low, and had a plea&s;ant appearance; the whole &s;eemed to be &s;urrounded by reefs, that ran two or three miles into the &s;ea. As we &s;ailed along the &s;hore, which was covered with cocoa-nut trees,
<PB REF="334">

<PB N="495" REF="335">
we &s;aw a few huts,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 16" UNIT="day"> and &s;moke in &s;everal parts up the coun|try. Soon after we hauled without a reef of rocks, to get round the lee-&s;ide of the i&s;land, and at the &s;ame time &s;ent out the boats to &s;ound, and examine the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The boats rowed clo&s;e along the &s;hore, and found it rocky, with trees growing clo&s;e down to the water-&s;ide. The&s;e trees were of different &s;orts, many of them very large, but had no fruit: on the lee-&s;ide, however, there were a few cocoa-nuts, but not a &s;ingle habitation was to be &s;een. They di&s;covered &s;everal &s;mall rills of water, which, by clearing, might have been made to run in a larger &s;tream. Soon after they had got clo&s;e to the &s;hore, &s;everal canoes came up to them, each having &s;ix or eight men on board. They appeared to be a robu&s;t, active people, and were quite naked, except a kind of mat that was wrapped round their middle. They were armed with large maces or clubs, &s;uch as Hercules is repre&s;ented with, two of which they &s;old to the Ma&s;ter for a nail or two, and &s;ome trinkets. As our people had &s;een no animal, either bird or bea&s;t, except &s;ea|fowl, they were very de&s;irous to learn of the natives whether they had either, but could not make them&s;elves under&s;tood. It appears that during this conference, a de&s;ign was formed to &s;eize our cutter, for one of the Indians &s;uddenly laid hold of her painter, and hauled her upon the rocks. Our people endeavoured, in vain, to make them de&s;i&s;t, till they fired a mu&s;ket cro&s;s the no&s;e of the man that was mo&s;t active in the mi&s;chief. No hurt was done; but the fire and report &s;o af|frighted them, that they made off with great precipitation. Both our boats then put off, but the water had fallen &s;o &s;ud|denly that they found it very difficult to get back to the &s;hip; for when they came into deep water they found the points of rocks &s;tanding up, and the whole reef, except in one part, was now dry, and a great &s;ea broke over it. The Indians probably perceived their di&s;tre&s;s, for they turned back, and
<PB N="496" REF="336">
followed them in their canoes all along the reef till they got to the breach,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 16" UNIT="day"> and then &s;eeing them clear, and making way fa&s;t towards the &s;hip, they returned.</P>
<P>About &s;ix in the evening, it being then dark, the boats re|turned, and the Ma&s;ter told me, that all within the reef was rocky, but that in two or three places, at about two cables' length without it, there was anchorage in 18, 14, and 12 fathom, upon &s;and and coral. The breach in the reef he found to be about 60 fathom broad, and here, if pre&s;&s;ed by nece&s;&s;ity, he &s;aid a &s;hip might anchor or moor in 8 fathom; but that it would not be &s;afe to moor with a greater length than half a cable.</P>
<P>When I had hoi&s;ted the boats in, I ran down four miles to leeward, where we lay till the morning; and then, finding that the current had &s;et us out of &s;ight of the i&s;land, I made &s;ail. The officers did me the honour to call this i&s;land after my name.<MILESTONE N="Wallis's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> WALLIS's ISLAND lies in latitude 13&deg; 18&prime; S. longi|tude 177&deg; W.</P>
<P>As the latitudes and longitudes of all the&s;e i&s;lands are ac|curately laid down, and plans of them delivered in to the Admiralty, it will be ea&s;y for any &s;hip, that &s;hall hereafter navigate the&s;e &s;eas, to find any of them, either to refre&s;h or to make farther di&s;coveries of their produce.</P>
<P>I thought it very remarkable, that although we found no kind of metal in any of the&s;e i&s;lands, yet the inhabitants of all of them, the moment they got a piece of iron in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, began to &s;harpen it, but made no &s;uch attempt on bra&s;s or copper.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;teer N. we&s;terly, and many birds were from time to time &s;een about the &s;hip till the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 28" UNIT="day"> when her longitude being, by ob&s;ervation, 187&deg; 24&prime; W. we cro&s;&s;ed the line into North latitude.

<P>At eight o'clock, the i&s;lands which I judged to be two of the Pi&s;cadores, bore from S. W. by W. to W. and to wind|ward, from N. by E. to N. E. and had the appearance of &s;mall flat keys.

<P><PB N="499" REF="340">At &s;ix in the evening,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 20" UNIT="day"> the hunters brought in a fine young bull, of near four hundred weight: part of it we kept on &s;hore, and &s;ent the re&s;t on board, with bread-fruit, limes, and oranges.</P>
<P>Early the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 21" UNIT="day"> the carpenters were &s;et at work to caulk the &s;hip all over, and put every thing in repair as far as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>In this place we got beef, pork, poultry, papaw apples, bread-fruit, limes, oranges, and every refre&s;hment that is mentioned in the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage. The &s;ick began to recover from the day they fir&s;t went on &s;hore: the air, however, was &s;o different here from what we found it in King George's I&s;land, that fle&s;h meat, which there kept &s;weet two days, could here be &s;carcely kept &s;weet one. There had been many cocoa-nut trees near the landing-place, but they had been all wa&s;tefully cut down for the fruit, and none being grown up in their &s;tead, we were forced to go three miles into the country before a &s;ingle nut could be procured. The hunters al&s;o &s;uffered incredible fatigue, for they were frequently obliged to go ten or twelve miles through one continued thicket, and the cattle were &s;o wild that it was very difficult to come near them, &s;o that I was obliged to re|lieve one party by another; and it being reported that cattle were more plenty at the North end of the i&s;land, but that the hunters being quite exhau&s;ted with fatigue when they got thither, were not able to kill them, much le&s;s to bring them down, I &s;ent Mr. Gore, with fourteen men, to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in that part of the i&s;land, and ordered that a boat &s;hould go every morning, at day-break, to bring in what

<P>I &s;ent an officer on &s;hore, to acquaint the Governor of our arrival, to obtain his permi&s;&s;ion to purcha&s;e refre&s;hments, and to tell him that I would &s;alute him, if he would engage to re|turn an equal number of guns. The Governor readily agreed; and at &s;un-ri&s;e, on Tue&s;day the 1&s;t of December,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 1" UNIT="day"> I &s;aluted him with thirteen guns, which he returned with fourteen from the fort. Soon after, the Pur&s;er &s;ent off &s;ome fre&s;h beef, and plenty of vegetables, which I ordered to be &s;erved immediately; at the &s;ame time I called the &s;hip's company together, and told them that I would not &s;uffer any liquor to come on board, and would &s;everely puni&s;h tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt to bring any: and I took &s;ome pains to reconcile them to this regulation, by a&s;&s;uring them that in this coun|try intemperance would inevitably de&s;troy them. As a fur|ther pre&s;ervative, I &s;uffered not a man to go on &s;hore, except tho&s;e who were upon duty; and took care that none even of the&s;e &s;traggled into the town.</P>
<P>On the 2d, I &s;ent the boat&s;wain and the carpenter,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 2" UNIT="day"> with the carpenter of the Falmouth, to look at &s;uch of her &s;tores as had been landed at Onru&s;t, with orders, that if any were
<PB N="508" REF="349">
fit for our u&s;e they &s;hould be bought.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 2" UNIT="day"> At their return, they informed me that all the &s;tores they had &s;een were rotten, and unfit for u&s;e, except one pair of tacks, which they brought with them: the ma&s;ts, yards, and cables were all dropping to pieces, and even the iron work was &s;o ru&s;ty that it was worth nothing. They al&s;o went on board the Fal|mouth to examine her hulk, and found her in &s;o &s;hattered a condition, that in their opinion &s;he could not be kept to|gether during the next mon&s;oon. Many of her ports were wa&s;hed into one, the &s;tern-po&s;t was quite decayed, and there was no place in her where a man could be &s;heltered from the weather. The few people who belonged to her were in as bad a &s;tate as their ve&s;&s;el, being quite broken and worn down, and expecting to be drowned as &s;oon as the mon&s;oon &s;hould &s;et in.</P>
<P>Among other nece&s;&s;aries, we were in want of an anchor, having lo&s;t two, and of three inch rope for rounding the cables; but the officers whom I had &s;ent to procure the&s;e articles, reported, that the price which had been demanded for them was &s;o exorbitant, that they had not agreed to give it. On Saturday the 5th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 5" UNIT="day"> therefore, I went on &s;hore my&s;elf, for the fir&s;t time, and vi&s;ited the different &s;torehou&s;es and ar&s;enals, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to make a better bargain than my officers. I &s;u&s;pected that the dealers took advan|tage of our apparent nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;uppo&s;ing that we could not &s;ail without what we had offered to purcha&s;e, determined to extort from us more than four times its value. I was, however, re&s;olved to make any &s;hift rather than &s;ubmit to what I thought a &s;hameful impo&s;ition, and therefore told them that I &s;hould certainly &s;ail on the next Tue&s;day; that if they would agree to my terms in the mean time, I would take the things I had treated for; if not, that I would &s;ail without them.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="350">Soon after I returned on board,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 5" UNIT="day"> I received a petition from the Warrant-Officers of the Falmouth, repre&s;enting, that there was nothing for them to look after: that the Gunner had been long dead, and his &s;tores &s;poiled, particularly the powder, which, by order of the Dutch, had been thrown into the &s;ea: that the boat&s;wain, by vexation and di&s;tre&s;s, had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and was then a deplorable object in a Dutch ho&s;pital: that all his &s;tores had been long &s;poiled and rotten, the roof of the &s;torehou&s;e having fallen in during a wet mon&s;oon, and left them expo&s;ed many months, all en|deavours to procure another place to put them in being in|effectual: that the carpenter was in a dying condition, and the cook a wounded cripple. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, they re|que&s;ted that I would take them home, or at lea&s;t di&s;mi&s;s them from their charge. It was with the greate&s;t regret and compa&s;&s;ion that I told the&s;e unhappy people it was not in my power to relieve them, and that as they had received charge of &s;tores, they mu&s;t wait orders from home. They replied, that they had never received a &s;ingle order from England &s;ince they had been left here, and earne&s;tly in|treated that I would make their di&s;tre&s;s known, that it might be relieved. They had, they &s;aid, ten years pay due, in the expectation of which they were grown old, and which now they would be content to forfeit, and go home &s;weepers, rather than continue to &s;uffer the mi&s;eries of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, which were indeed very great. They were not &s;uffered to &s;pend a &s;ingle night on &s;hore, whatever was their condition, and when they were &s;ick, no one vi&s;ited them on board; they were, be&s;ides, robbed by the Malays, and in perpetual dread of being de&s;troyed by them, as they had a &s;hort time before burnt the Siam prize. I a&s;&s;ured them that I would do my utmo&s;t to procure them relief, and they left me with tears in their eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="351">As I heard nothing more of the anchor and rope for which I had been in treaty,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 5" UNIT="day"> I made all ready for &s;ea. The &s;hip's company had continued healthy and &s;ober, and been &s;erved with fre&s;h beef every day, from the time of our fir&s;t coming to an anchor in the Road; we had al&s;o &s;ome beef, and a live ox, to carry out with us. We had now only one man upon the &s;ick li&s;t, except a &s;eaman, who had been afflicted with rheumatic pains ever &s;ince our leaving the Streight of Ma|gellan: and at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, of Tue&s;day the 8th of December,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 8" UNIT="day"> after a &s;tay of ju&s;t one week, we &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>On the 11th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 11" UNIT="day"> at noon, we were off a &s;mall i&s;land called the Cap, between the coa&s;ts of Sumatra and Java, and &s;everal of our people fell down with colds and fluxes.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 12" UNIT="day"> The next day, a Dutch boat came on board, and &s;old us &s;ome turtle, which was &s;erved to the &s;hip's company. At night, being at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the Java &s;hore, we &s;aw an incredible number of lights upon the beach, which we &s;up|po&s;ed were intended to draw the fi&s;h near it, as we had &s;een the &s;ame appearance at other places.</P>
<P>On Monday the 14th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 14" UNIT="day"> we anchored off Prince's I&s;land, and began to take in wood and water.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> The next morning, the natives came in with turtle, poultry, and hog-deer, which we bought at a rea&s;onable price. We continued here, fitting the &s;hip for the &s;ea,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 19" UNIT="day"> till the 19th, during which time many of the people began to complain of intermitting di&s;orders, &s;omething like an ague.<MILESTONE N="Sunday 20" UNIT="day"> At &s;ix o'clock the next morning, having completed our wood, and taken on board &s;eventy-&s;ix tons of water, we made &s;ail.</P>
<P>While we lay here, one of the &s;eamen fell from the main yard into the barge, which lay along &s;ide the &s;hip. His body was dreadfully brui&s;ed, and many of his bones were broken: it happened al&s;o, that in his fall he &s;truck two other
<PB N="511" REF="352">
men,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 24" UNIT="day"> one of whom was &s;o much hurt that he continued &s;peechle&s;s till the 24th, and then died, though the other had only one of his toes broken. We had now no le&s;s than &s;ixteen upon the &s;ick li&s;t, and by the 1&s;t of January,<MILESTONE N="January" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Friday 1" UNIT="day"> the num|ber was increa&s;ed to forty; we had buried three, among whom was the Quarter-Ma&s;ter, George Lewis, who was a diligent, &s;ober man, and the more u&s;eful, as he &s;poke both the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e languages. The di&s;ea&s;es by which we &s;uffered, were fluxes, and fevers of the putrid kind, which are always contagious, and, for that rea&s;on alone, would be more fatal on board a &s;hip than any other. The Surgeon's mate was very &s;oon laid up, and tho&s;e who were appointed to attend the &s;ick, were always taken ill in a day or two after they had been upon that &s;ervice. To re|medy this evil, as much as it was in my power, I made a very large birth for the &s;ick, by removing a great number of people from below to the half deck, which I hung with painted canva&s;s, keeping it con&s;tantly clean, and directing it to be wa&s;hed with vinegar, and fumigated once or twice a day. Our water was well ta&s;ted, and was kept con&s;tantly ventilated; a large piece of iron al&s;o, u&s;ed for the melting of tar, and called a loggerhead, was heated red hot, and quenched in it before it was given out to be drank. The &s;ick had al&s;o wine in&s;tead of grog, and &s;alep or &s;ago every morning for breakfa&s;t: two days in a week they had mutton broth, and had a fowl or two given them on the inter|mediate days; they had, be&s;ides, plenty of rice and &s;ugar, and frequently malt me&s;hed; &s;o that perhaps people in a &s;ickly &s;hip had never &s;o many refre&s;hments before: the Sur|geon al&s;o was indefatigable; yet, with all the&s;e advantages, the &s;ickne&s;s on board gained ground. In the mean time, to aggravate our misfortune, the &s;hip made more than three
<PB N="512" REF="353">
feet water in a watch; <MILESTONE N="1768" UNIT="year">  and all her upper works were very open and loo&s;e.</P>
<P>By the 10th of January,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 10" UNIT="day"> the &s;ickne&s;s began, in &s;ome de|gree, to abate, but more than half the company were &s;o feeble, that they could &s;carcely crawl about.

<P>On the 24th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 24" UNIT="day"> in latitude 33&deg; 40&prime; S. longitude, by account, 328&deg; 17&prime; W. we met with a violent gale, which &s;plit the main-top-&s;ail and the main-top-ma&s;t-&s;tay-&s;ail all to pieces. The &s;ea broke over the &s;hip in a dreadful manner, the &s;tarboard rudder-chain was broken, and many of the booms were wa&s;hed overboard. During the &s;torm we &s;aw &s;everal birds and butterflies; and our fir&s;t attention, after it &s;ub&s;ided, was to dry the bedding of the &s;ick: at the &s;ame time, every one on board who could handle a needle was employed in re|pairing the &s;ails, which were now in a &s;hattered condition.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> An Account of our Tran&s;actions at the Cape of Good Hope, and of the Return of the Dolphin to England.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the &s;hip was at anchor, I &s;ent an officer on &s;hore, with the u&s;ual compliments to the Governor, who received him with great civility, telling him that we were welcome to all the refre&s;hments and a&s;&s;i&s;tance that the Cape afforded, and that he would return our &s;alute with the &s;ame number of guns.</P>
<P>We found riding here a Dutch Commodore, with &s;ixteen &s;ail of Dutch Ea&s;t Indiamen, a French Ea&s;t India &s;hip, and the Admiral Wat&s;on, Captain Griffin, an Ea&s;t India packet boat, for Bengal. We &s;aluted the Governor with thirteen guns, and he returned the &s;ame number; the Admiral Wat|&s;on &s;aluted us with eleven guns, and we returned nine; the French &s;hip afterwards &s;aluted us with nine guns, and we returned &s;even.</P>
<P>Having got off &s;ome mutton for the &s;hip's company, with plenty of greens, I &s;ent the Surgeon on &s;hore to hire quar|ters for the &s;ick, but he could procure none for le&s;s than two &s;hillings a day, and a &s;tipulation to pay more, if any of them &s;hould take the &s;mall-pox, which was then in almo&s;t every hou&s;e, in proportion to the malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e.
<PB N="514" REF="355">
The fir&s;t expence being great, and it appearing, upon en|quiry, that many of our people had never had the &s;mall-pox, &s;o that the increa&s;e was likely to be con&s;iderable, be&s;ides the danger, I reque&s;ted the Governor's permi&s;&s;ion to erect a tent upon a &s;pacious plain, at about two miles di&s;tance from the town, called Green Point, and to &s;end my people on &s;hore thither during the day, under the care of an officer, to prevent their &s;traggling. This permi&s;&s;ion the Governor im|mediately granted, and gave orders that they &s;hould &s;uffer no mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>In this place, therefore, I ordered tents to be erected, and the Surgeon and his mate, with proper officers, to attend; at the &s;ame time &s;trictly charging that no man &s;hould be &s;uffered to go into the town, and that no liquor &s;hould be brought to the tents. All the &s;ick, except two, left the &s;hip early in the morning, with their provi&s;ions and firing; and for tho&s;e that were reduced to great weakne&s;s, I ordered the Surgeon to procure &s;uch extraordinary provi&s;ions as he &s;hould think proper, particularly milk, though it was &s;old at an exce&s;&s;ive price. About &s;ix in the evening, they re|turned on board, and &s;eemed to be greatly refre&s;hed. At the &s;ame time, being extremely ill my&s;elf, I was obliged to be put on &s;hore, and carried about eight miles up the coun|try, where I continued all the time the &s;hip lay here; and when &s;he was ready to &s;ail, returned on board without having received the lea&s;t benefit.</P>
<P>No time, however, was lo&s;t in refitting the ve&s;&s;el: the &s;ails were all unbent, the yards and top-ma&s;ts &s;truck, the forge was &s;et up, the carpenters were employed in caulking, the &s;ail-makers in mending the &s;ails, the cooper in repairing the ca&s;ks, the people in over-hauling the rigging, and the boats in filling water.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="356">By the 10th of February,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 10" UNIT="day"> the heavy work being nearly di&s;patched, twenty of the men who had had the &s;mall-pox, were permitted to go a&s;hore at the town, and others, who were &s;till liable to the di&s;temper, were landed at &s;ome di&s;tance, with orders to go into the country, and return in the evening, which they punctually obeyed: this liberty, therefore, was continued to them all the while the ve&s;&s;el lay at this port, which produced &s;o good an effect, that the &s;hip's company, except the &s;ick, who recovered very fa&s;t, had a more healthy and vigorous appearance than when they left England. We purcha&s;ed here the nece&s;&s;aries that we endea|voured to procure at Batavia, at a rea&s;onable price, be&s;ides canvas and other &s;tores; we al&s;o procured fre&s;h water by di&s;tillation, principally to &s;hew the captains of the India|men, and their officers, that, upon an emergency, whole&s;ome water might be procured at &s;ea. At five o'clock in the morning, we put fifty-&s;ix gallons of &s;alt water into the &s;till, at &s;even it began to run, and in about five hours and a quar|ter afforded us &s;ix and thirty gallons of fre&s;h water, at an expence of nine pounds of wood, and &s;ixty-nine pounds of coals. Thirteen gallons and two quarts remained in the &s;till, and that which came off had no ill ta&s;te, nor, as we had often experienced, any hurtful quality. I thought the &s;hewing this experiment of the more con&s;equence, as the being able to allow plenty of water not only for drink, but for boiling any kind of provi&s;ion, and even for making tea and coffee, e&s;pecially during long voyages, and in hot cli|mates, conduces greatly to health, and is the means of &s;aving many lives. I never once put my people to an allowance of water during this whole voyage, always u&s;ing the &s;till when we were reduced to five and forty tons, and pre&s;erving the rain water with the utmo&s;t diligence. I did not, however, allow water to be fetched away at plea&s;ure, but the officer of
<PB N="516" REF="357">
the watch had orders to give &s;uch as brought provi&s;ions of any kind, water &s;ufficient to dre&s;s it, and a proper quantity al&s;o to &s;uch as brought tea and coffee.</P>
<P>On the 25th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> the wood and water being nearly completed, and the &s;hip almo&s;t ready for the &s;ea, I ordered every body to go on board, and the &s;ick tents to be brought off; the people being &s;o well recovered, that in the whole &s;hip's com|pany there were but three men unable to do duty, and hap|pily, &s;ince our leaving Batavia, we had lo&s;t but three. The next day,<MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> <MILESTONE N="Saturday 27" UNIT="day"> and the day following, the carpenters fini&s;hed caulking all the out-works, the fore-ca&s;tle, and the main-deck; we got all our bread on board from the &s;hore, with a con|&s;iderable quantity of &s;traw, and thirty-four &s;heep for &s;ea-&s;tores. In the mean time I came on board, and having un|moored,<MILESTONE N="March" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> lay waiting for a wind till the evening of Thur&s;day the 3d of March, when a breeze &s;pringing up, we got under &s;ail. While we were on &s;hore at Green Point, we had an opportunity of making many cele&s;tial ob&s;ervations, by which, we determined Table Bay to lie in latitude 34&deg; 2&prime; S. longitude, from Greenwich, 18&deg; 8&prime; E. The variation of the needle, at this place, was 19&deg; 30&prime; W.</P>
<P>On the 7th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 7" UNIT="day"> being in latitude 29&deg; 33&prime; S. longitude, by ac|count, 347&deg; 38&prime; the &s;hip was eight miles to the Northward of her dead reckoning.</P>
<P>On the 13th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 13" UNIT="day"> having &s;ailed we&s;tward 360 degrees from the meridian of London, we had lo&s;t a day; I therefore called the latter part of this day Monday, March 14th.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, of Wedne&s;day the 16th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 16" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw the I&s;land of Saint Helena, at the di&s;tance of about four|teen leagues; <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> and at one the next morning, brought to. At break of day, we made &s;ail for the i&s;land, and at nine, an|chored in the bay. The fort &s;aluted us with thirteen guns,
<PB N="517" REF="358">
and we returned the &s;ame number.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> We found riding here the Northumberland Indiaman, Captain Milford, who &s;a|luted us with eleven guns, and we returned nine. We got out all the boats as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ent the empty ca&s;ks to be filled with water; at the &s;ame time &s;everal of the people were employed to gather pur&s;lain, which grows here in great plenty. About two o'clock, I went on &s;hore my&s;elf, and was &s;aluted by the fort with thirteen guns, which I re|turned. The Governor and the principal gentlemen of the i&s;land did me the honour to meet me at the water-&s;ide, and having conducted me to the fort, told me, that it was ex|pected I &s;hould make it my home during my &s;tay.</P>
<P>By noon the next day, our water was completed,<MILESTONE N="Friday 18" UNIT="day"> and the &s;hip was made ready for &s;ea; &s;oon after, &s;he was unmoored, to take advantage of the fir&s;t breeze, and at five in the after|noon, I returned on board. Upon my leaving the &s;hore, I was &s;aluted with thirteen guns, and &s;oon after, upon getting under way, I was &s;aluted with thirteen more, both which I returned; the Northumberland Indiaman then &s;aluted me with thirteen guns, &s;o did the O&s;terly, which arrived here the evening before I made &s;ail, and I returned the compli|ment with the &s;ame number.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, in the evening,<MILESTONE N="Monday 21" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw &s;everal men of war birds; and at midnight, heard many birds about the &s;hip.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 22" UNIT="day"> At five o'clock in the morning of the 23d,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 23" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw the I&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion; and at eight, di&s;covered a &s;hip to the Ea&s;t|ward, who brought to, and hoi&s;ted a jack at her main-top-ma&s;t-head, upon which we &s;hewed our colours, and &s;he then &s;tood in for the land again. We ran down clo&s;e along the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and looked into the bay, but &s;eeing no &s;hip there, and it blowing a &s;tiff gale, I made the be&s;t of my way.</P>
<P>On Monday the 28th, we cro&s;&s;ed the equator,<MILESTONE N="Monday 28" UNIT="day"> and got again into North latitude.</P>
<P><PB N="518" REF="359">On Wedne&s;day, the 13th of April,<MILESTONE N="April" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 13" UNIT="day"> we pa&s;&s;ed a great quan|tity of gulph weed; and on the 17th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 17" UNIT="day"> we pa&s;&s;ed a great deal more. On the 19th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw two flocks of birds, and ob&s;erv|ing the water to be di&s;coloured, we thought the ground might be reached, but, upon &s;ounding, could find no bottom.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the morning of Sunday the 24th,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 24" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw the peak of the I&s;land of Pico bearing N. N. E. at the di&s;tance of about eighteen leagues. We found, by ob&s;erva|tion, that Fyal lies in latitude 38&deg; 20&prime; N. longitude 28&deg; 30&prime; W. from London.</P>
<P>No incident worth recording happened till about noon on the 11th of May,<MILESTONE N="May" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 11" UNIT="day"> when, being in latitude 48&deg; 44&prime; N. longi|tude 7&deg; 16&prime; W. we &s;aw a &s;hip in chace of a &s;loop, at which &s;he fired &s;everal guns. We bore away, and at three, fired a gun at the chace, and brought her to; the &s;hip to windward, being near the chace, immediately &s;ent a boat on board her, and &s;oon after, Captain Hammond, of his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop the Savage, came on board of me, and told me that the ve&s;&s;el he had chaced, when he fir&s;t &s;aw her, was in company with an Iri&s;h wherry, and that as &s;oon as they di&s;covered him to be a man of war, they took different ways; the wherry hauled the wind, and the other ve&s;&s;el bore away. That he at fir&s;t hauled the wind, and &s;tood after the wherry, but finding that he gained no ground, he bore away after the other ve&s;&s;el, which probably would al&s;o have e&s;caped, if I had not &s;topped her, for that he gained very little ground in the chace. She appeared to be laden with tea, brandy, and other goods, from Ro&s;coe in France; and though &s;he was &s;teering a &s;outh-we&s;t cour&s;e, pretended to be bound to Ber|gen in Norway. She belonged to Liverpool, was called the Jenny, and commanded by one Robert Chri&s;tian. Her brandy and tea were in &s;mall kegs and bags; and all ap|pearances

being &s;trongly again&s;t her, I detained her, in order to be &s;ent to England.</P>
<P>At half an hour after five, on the 13th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 13" UNIT="day"> we &s;aw the I&s;lands of Scilly; on the 19th, I landed at Ha&s;tings in Su&s;&s;ex; <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> and at four the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Friday 20" UNIT="day"> the &s;hip anchored &s;afely in the Downs, it being ju&s;t 637 days &s;ince her weighing anchor in Plymouth Sound. To this narrative, I have only to add, that the object of the voyage being di&s;covery, it was my con&s;tant practice, during the whole time of my navigating tho&s;e parts of the &s;ea which are not perfectly known, to lie to every night, and make &s;ail only in the day, that nothing might e&s;cape me.</P>

<P>AN ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE round the WORLD, IN THE YEARS MDCCLXVI, MDCCLXVII, MDCCLXVIII, and MDCCLXIX. By PHILIP CARTERET, E&s;quire, Commander of his Maje&s;ty's Sloop the SWALLOW.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="365">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Run from Plymouth to Madeira, and from thence through the Streight of Magellan.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[The longitude in this voyage is reckoned from London we&s;tward to 180, and ea&s;tward afterwards.]</HEAD>
<P>SOON after I returned from a voyage round the world with the Honourable Commodore Byron,<MILESTONE N="1766" UNIT="year"> <MILESTONE N="Augu&s;t" UNIT="month"> I was appoint|ed to the command of his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop the Swallow, by a commi&s;&s;ion bearing date the 1&s;t of July 1766; the Swallow then lay at Chatham, and I was ordered to fit her out with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. She was an old &s;hip, having been in the &s;ervice thirty years, and was in my opinion by no means fit for a long voyage, having only a &s;light thin &s;heath|ing upon her bottom, which was not even filled with nails to &s;upply the want of a covering that would more effectually keep out the worm. I had been given to under&s;tand that I was to go out with the Dolphin; but the di&s;parity of the two &s;hips, and the difference in their equipment, made me think that they could not be intended for the &s;ame duty; the Dol|phin, which was &s;heathed with copper, being &s;upplied with every thing that was requi&s;ite for a long and dangerous navigation; and the Swallow having only a &s;canty &s;upply of common nece&s;&s;aries. However, I ventured to apply for a forge, &s;ome iron, a &s;mall &s;kiff, and &s;everal other things
<PB N="526" REF="366">
which I knew by experience would be of the utmo&s;t import|ance, if it was intended that I &s;hould make another voyage round the world; but I was told that the ve&s;&s;el and her equipment were very fit for the &s;ervice &s;he was to perform, and none of the requi&s;ites for which I applied were allowed me. I was therefore confirmed in my opinion, that, if the Dolphin was to go round the world, it could never be in|tended that I &s;hould go farther than Falkland's I&s;lands, where the Ja&s;on, a fine frigate, which was, like the Dolphin, &s;heathed with copper, and amply equipped, would &s;upply my place. I was however deficient in junk, an article which is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in every voyage, and for this I applied when I got to Plymouth, but I was told that a quan|tity &s;ufficient for both the &s;hips had been put on board the Dolphin.</P>
<P>On Friday the 22d of Augu&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Friday 22" UNIT="day"> 1766, the &s;hip's company having the evening before received two months pay, I weighed, and made &s;ail from Plymouth found in company with the Dolphin, under the command of Captain Wallis, and the Prince Frederic &s;tore-&s;hip, commanded by Lieutenant James Brine.<MILESTONE N="September" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Sunday 7" UNIT="day"> We proceeded together without any remark|able incident till the 7th of September, when we came to an anchor in Madeira road.</P>
<P>While I lay at this place, not being yet acquainted with my de&s;tination, I repre&s;ented my want of junk, and the re|ply that had been made to my application for a &s;upply by the commi&s;&s;ioner at Plymouth, in a letter to Captain Wallis, who &s;ent me five hundred weight. This quantity however was &s;o inadequate to my wants, that I was &s;oon afterwards reduced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of cutting off &s;ome of my cables to &s;ave my rigging.</P>
<P><PB N="527" REF="367">On the 9th, very early in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 9" UNIT="day"> the Lieutenant ac|quainted me that, in the night, nine of my be&s;t men had &s;ecretly &s;et off from the &s;hip to &s;wim on &s;hore, having &s;trip|ped them&s;elves naked and left all their clothes behind them, taking only their money, which they had &s;ecured in a hand|kerchief that was tied round their wai&s;t; that they pro|ceeded together till they came very near the &s;urf, which breaks high upon the &s;hore, and that one of them, being then terrified at the &s;ound, had &s;wum back again to the &s;hip, and been taken on board, but that the re&s;t had ventured through. As the lo&s;s of the&s;e men would have been very &s;everely felt, I immediately &s;at down to write a letter to the Con&s;ul, entreating his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to recover them; but, before I had fini&s;hed it, he &s;ent me word, that all of them having, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the natives, been found naked on the beach, they had been taken into cu&s;tody, and would be delivered up to my order. The boat was di&s;patched immediately, and as &s;oon as I heard they were on board, I went upon the deck. I was greatly plea&s;ed to &s;ee a contrition in their countenances, which at once &s;e|cretly determined me not to inflict the puni&s;hment by which they &s;eemed mo&s;t heartily willing to expiate their fault; but I a&s;ked them what could have induced them to quit the &s;hip, and de&s;ert the &s;ervice of their country, at the ri&s;k of being devoured by &s;harks, or da&s;hed to pieces by the &s;urf again&s;t the &s;hore. They an&s;wered, that though they had indeed at &s;uch ri&s;ks ventured to &s;wim on &s;hore, they never had any in|tention of de&s;erting the &s;hip, which they were determined to &s;tand by as long as &s;he could &s;wim; but that being well a&s;&s;ured they were going a long voyage, and none being able to tell who might live, or who might die, they thought it hard not to have an opportunity of &s;pending their own mo|ney, and therefore determined, as they &s;aid, once more to
<PB N="528" REF="368">
get a &s;kinful of liquor,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 9" UNIT="day"> and then &s;wim back to the &s;hip, which they hoped to have done before they were mi&s;&s;ed. As I had re&s;olved to remit their puni&s;hment, I did not too &s;everely &s;crutinize their apology, which the re&s;t of the &s;hip's company, who &s;tood round them, &s;eemed very much to ap|prove; but, ob&s;erving that with a &s;kinful of liquor they would have been in a very unfit condition to &s;wim through the &s;urf to the &s;hip, I told them that hoping they would for the future expo&s;e their lives only upon more important oc|ca&s;ions, and that their conduct would thenceforward give me no cau&s;e of complaint, I would for this time be &s;atisfied with the &s;hame and regret which I perceived they &s;uffered from a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;behaviour: I then admoni&s;hed them to put on their clothes, and lie down, as I was confident they wanted re&s;t; and added, that as I might po&s;&s;ibly during the cour&s;e of the voyage have occa&s;ion for good &s;wimmers, I was very glad that I knew to whom I might apply. Having thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the&s;e hone&s;t fellows from their fears, I was in|finitely gratified by the murmur of &s;atisfaction which in|&s;tantly ran through the &s;hip's company; and was after|wards amply rewarded for my lenity, there being no &s;er|vice during all the toils and dangers of the voyage which they did not perform, with a zeal and alacrity that were much to their honour and my advantage, as an example to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed again on the 12th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 12" UNIT="day"> and I was then fir&s;t acquainted with the particulars of our voyage by Captain Wallis, who gave me a copy of his in&s;tructions, and appointed Port Fa|mine in the Streight of Magellan to be the place of rendez|vous, if we &s;hould happen to be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>I was now convinced that I had been &s;ent upon a &s;ervice to which my ve&s;&s;el and her equipment were by no means
<PB N="529" REF="369">
equal,<MILESTONE N="November" UNIT="month"> but I determined at all events to perform it in the be&s;t manner I was able.</P>
<P>We proceeded on our voyage without any remarkable event till we anchored off Cape Virgin Mary, where we &s;aw the Patagonians, of which I have given &s;ome account in a letter to Dr. Matty, which was publi&s;hed in the &s;ixtieth vo|lume of the Tran&s;actions of the Royal Society, and which it is not nece&s;&s;ary here to repeat, as it is in general the &s;ame as tho&s;e which have been given by Commodore Byron and Captain Wallis.</P>
<P>When we entered the Streight, I was ordered to keep ahead of the Dolphin and the &s;tore&s;hip, to pilot them through the &s;hoals; but my &s;hip worked &s;o ill, that we could but very &s;eldom make her tack without the help of a boat to tow her round: however, with much labour, and at no incon&s;iderable ri&s;k, we anchored in Port Famine on Friday the 26th of December.<MILESTONE N="December" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Friday 26" UNIT="day"> At this place we unhung our rud|der, and added a piece of wood to it, in hopes that by mak|ing it broader, we &s;hould obtain &s;ome advantage in working the &s;hip; in which however we were altogether di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>After many difficulties and dangers,<MILESTONE N="1767" UNIT="year"> <MILESTONE N="February" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> we got into I&s;land Bay on the 17th of February; and before we made &s;ail again, I repre&s;ented the condition of my &s;hip by letter to Captain Wallis, and reque&s;ted him to con&s;ider what was be&s;t for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, whether &s;he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, or conti|nue the voyage. Captain Wallis replied, that as the Lords of the Admiralty had ordered the Swallow on this &s;ervice, with the nature of which I was well acquainted, he did not think him&s;elf at liberty to alter her de&s;tination.</P>
<P><PB N="530" REF="370">We continued therefore for &s;ome time to navigate the Streight together, and as I had pa&s;&s;ed it before, I was or|dered to keep ahead and lead the way, with liberty to an|chor and weigh when I thought proper; but perceiving that the bad &s;ailing of the Swallow would &s;o much retard the Dolphin as probably to make her lo&s;e the &s;ea&s;on for getting into high &s;outhern latitudes, and defeat the intention of the voyage, I propo&s;ed to Captain Wallis, that he &s;hould lay the Swallow up in &s;ome cove or bay, and that I &s;hould attend and a&s;&s;i&s;t him with her boats till the Streight &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, which would probably be in much le&s;s time than if he continued to be retarded by my &s;hip, and I urged as an additional advantage that he might complete not only his &s;tock of provi&s;ions and &s;tores, but his company, out of her, and then &s;end her back to England, with &s;uch of his crew as &s;ickne&s;s had rendered unfit for the voyage: propo|&s;ing al&s;o, that in my way home, I would examine the ea&s;tern co&s;t of Patagonia, or attempt &s;uch other di&s;coveries as he &s;hould think proper. If this was not approved, and my knowlege of the South Seas was thought nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage, I offered to go with him on board the Dolphin, and give up the Swallow to be commanded by his Fir&s;t Lieutenant, who&s;e duty I would perform during the re&s;t of the voyage, or to make the voyage my&s;elf with only the Dolphin, if he would take the Swallow back to Europe; but Captain Wallis was &s;till of opinion that the voyage &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted by the two &s;hips jointly, pur&s;uant to the orders that had been given.</P>
<P>The Swallow was now become &s;o foul, that with all the &s;ails &s;he could &s;et &s;he could not make &s;o much way as the Dolphin,<MILESTONE N="April" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Friday 10" UNIT="day"> with only her top-&s;ails and a reef in them: we continued in company, however, till Friday the 10th of
<PB N="531" REF="371">
April, when the we&s;tern entrance of the Streight was open,<MILESTONE N="Friday 10" UNIT="day"> and the great South Sea in &s;ight. Hitherto I had, pur&s;uant to my directions, kept ahead, but now the Dolphin being nearly abrea&s;t of us, &s;et her fore&s;ail, which &s;oon carried her ahead of us; and before nine o'clock in the evening, as &s;he &s;hewed no lights, we lo&s;t &s;ight of her. We had a fine ea&s;tern breeze, of which we made the be&s;t u&s;e we could during the night, carrying all our &s;mall &s;ails, even to the top-gallant &s;tudding &s;ails, notwith&s;tanding the danger to which it expo&s;ed us; but at day-break the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 11" UNIT="day"> we could but ju&s;t &s;ee the Dolphin's top-&s;ails above the horizon, we could perceive, however, that &s;he had &s;tudding &s;ails &s;et, and at nine o'clock, we had entirely lo&s;t &s;ight of her; we judged that &s;he was then clear of the Streight's mouth, but we, who were &s;till under the land, had but light and va|riable airs. From this time, I gave up all hope of &s;eeing the Dolphin again till we &s;hould arrive in England, no plan of operation having been &s;ettled, nor any place of rendezvous appointed, as had been done from England to the Streight. I thought my&s;elf the more unfortunate in this &s;eparation, as no part of the woollen cloth, linen, beads, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, knives, and other cutlery-ware, and toys, which were intended for the u&s;e of both &s;hips, and were &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to obtain re|fre&s;hments from Indians, had, during the nine months we had &s;ailed together, been put on board the Swallow, and as we were not provided either with a forge or iron, which many circum&s;tances might render ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of the &s;hip: I had the &s;atisfaction, however, to &s;ee no marks of de&s;pondency among my people, whom I encouraged, by telling them, that although the Dolphin was the be&s;t &s;hip, I did not doubt but that I &s;hould find more than equivalent advantages in their courage, ability, and good conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="372">At noon,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 11" UNIT="day"> this day, we were abrea&s;t of Cape Pillar, when, a gale &s;pringing up at S. W. we were obliged to take down our &s;mall &s;ails, reef our top-&s;ails, and haul clo&s;e to the wind: &s;oon after it fre&s;hened to the W. S. W. blowing right in from the &s;ea, and after making two boards, we had the mortification to find that we could not weather the land on either tack. It was now almo&s;t dark, the gale increa&s;ed, driving before it a hollow &s;well, and a fog came on, with violent rain; we therefore got clo&s;e under the &s;outh &s;hore, and &s;ent our boat a-head to find out Tue&s;day's Bay, which is &s;aid by Sir John Narborough to lie about four leagues within the Streight, or to find out any other place in which we might come to an anchor. At five o'clock, we could not &s;ee the land, notwith&s;tanding its extream height, though we were within le&s;s than half a mile of it, and at &s;ix, the thickne&s;s of the weather having rendered the night &s;o dark that we could not &s;ee half the &s;hip's length, I brought to for the boat, and was indeed, with good rea&s;on, under great concern for her &s;afety: we hoi&s;ted lights, and every now and then made a fal&s;e fire, but &s;till doubting whether they could be &s;een through the fog and rain, I fired a gun every half hour, and at la&s;t had the &s;atisfaction to take her on board, though &s;he had made no di&s;covery either of Tue&s;day's Bay, or any other anchoring-place. We made &s;ail the re&s;t of the night, endeavouring to keep near the &s;outh &s;hore, and our ground to the we&s;tward as much as po&s;&s;ible; and as &s;oon as it was light the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 12" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter again out in the cutter, in &s;earch of anchorage on the &s;outh &s;hore. I waited in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e for her return, till five o'clock in the afternoon, fearing that we &s;hould be obliged to keep out in this dangerous pa&s;s another night, but I then &s;aw her &s;ounding a bay, and immediately &s;tood in after her: in a &s;hort time the Ma&s;ter came on board, and
<PB N="533" REF="373">
to our un&s;peakable comfort,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 12" UNIT="day"> reported that we might here come &s;afely to an anchor; this, with the help of our boat, was effected about &s;ix o'clock, and I went down into my cabbin to take &s;ome re&s;t: I had, however, &s;carcely lain down, before I was alarmed with a univer&s;al &s;hout and tumult among the people, all that were below running ha&s;tily upon the deck, and joining the clamour of tho&s;e above: I in&s;tantly &s;tarted up, imagining that a gu&s;t had forced the &s;hip from her anchor, and that &s;he was driving out of the bay, but when I came upon the deck, I heard the people cry out, the Dolphin! the Dolphin! in a tran&s;port of &s;urprize and joy which appeared to be little &s;hort of di&s;traction: a few minutes, however, convinced us that what had been taken for a &s;ail was nothing more than the water which had been forced up, and whirled about in the air, by one of the violent gu&s;ts that were continually coming off the high land, and which, through the haze, had a mo&s;t deceitful appearance. The people were for a few minutes &s;omewhat dejected by their di&s;appointment, but before I went down, I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee their u&s;ual fortitude and cheerfulne&s;s return.</P>
<P>The little bay where we were now at anchor, lies about three leagues E. by S. from Cape Pillar: it is the fir&s;t place which has any appearance of a bay within that Cape, and bears S. by E. about four leagues from the i&s;land which Sir John Narborough called We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, from its re&s;em|blance to that building in a di&s;tant view. The we&s;tern point of this bay makes a very remarkable appearance, being a perpendicular plane like the wall of a hou&s;e. There are three i&s;lands about two cables' length within its entrance, and within tho&s;e i&s;lands a very good harbour, with anchor|age in between twenty-five and thirty fathom, with a bottom of &s;oft mud. We anchored without the i&s;lands, the pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="534" REF="374">
on each &s;ide of them being not more than one-fourth of a cable's length wide. Our little bay is about two cables' length broad, the points bearing ea&s;t and we&s;t of each other: in the inner part there is from &s;ixteen to eighteen fathom, but where we lay it is deeper; we had one anchor in &s;eventeen fathom, and the other in forty-five, with great over-falls between them, and rocks in &s;everal places. Here we rode out a very hard gale, and the ground being ex|tremely uneven, we expected our cables to be cut in two every minute, yet when we weighed, to our great &s;urprize, they did not appear to have been rubbed in any part, though we found it very difficult to heave them clear of the rocks. The land round this bay and harbour is all high, and as the current &s;ets continually into it, I doubt not but it has an|other communication with the &s;ea to the &s;outh of Cape De|&s;eada. The Ma&s;ter &s;aid he went up it four miles in a boat, and could not then be above four miles from the We&s;tern Ocean, yet I &s;till &s;aw a wide entrance to the S. W. The land|ing is every where good, there is plenty of wood and water, and mu&s;cles and wild gee&s;e in abundance.</P>
<P>From the north &s;hore of the we&s;tern end of the Streight of Magellan, which lies in about latitude 52&deg; &frac12; S. to latitude 48&deg;, the land, which is the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Patagonia, runs nearly north and &s;outh, and con&s;i&s;ts wholly of broken i&s;lands, among which are tho&s;e that Sharp has laid down by the name of the Duke of York's I&s;lands; he has indeed placed them at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the coa&s;t, but if there had been many i&s;lands in that &s;ituation, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that the Dolphin, the Tamar, or the Swallow, mu&s;t have &s;een them, as we ran near their &s;uppo&s;ed meridian, and &s;o did the Dolphin and the Tamar the la&s;t voyage. Till we came into this latitude, we had tolerable weather, and little
<PB N="535" REF="375">
or no current in any direction, but when we came to the northward of 48&deg;, we found a current &s;etting &s;trongly to the north, &s;o that probably we then opened the great bay, which is &s;aid to be ninety leagues deep. We found here a va&s;t &s;well from the N. W. and the winds generally blew from the &s;ame quarter; yet we were &s;et every day twelve or fifteen miles to the northward of our account.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 15th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> at about four o'clock in the morning, after &s;urmounting many dangers and difficulties, we once more got abrea&s;t of Cape Pillar, with a light breeze at S. E. and a great &s;well. Between five and &s;ix o'clock, ju&s;t as we opened Cape De&s;eada, the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifted to S. and S. by W. and blew &s;o hard that it was with great dif|ficulty we could carry the reefed top-&s;ails: the &s;udden changing of the wind, and its exce&s;&s;ive violence, produced a &s;ea &s;o dreadfully hollow, that great quantities of water were thrown in upon our deck, &s;o that we were in the utmo&s;t danger of foundering; yet we did not dare to &s;horten &s;ail, it being nece&s;&s;ary to carry all we could &s;pread, in order to weather the rocky i&s;lands, which Sir John Narborough has called the I&s;lands of Direction, for we could not now run back again into the Streight, without falling down among the broken land, and incurring the dangers of the northern &s;hore, which was to leeward; towards this broken land, however, and lee &s;hore, the &s;hip &s;ettled very fa&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding our utmo&s;t efforts: in this pre&s;&s;ing emergency we were obliged to &s;tave all the water-ca&s;ks upon the deck, and between decks, to clear the ve&s;&s;el, and to make her carry better &s;ail, and at length happily e&s;caped the danger which threatened us. After we got clear of the&s;e i&s;lands, and drew off from the Streight's mouth and the land, we found
<PB N="536" REF="376">
the &s;ea run more regularly from the S. W. and the wind &s;oon after coming from S. S. W. to S. S. E. we had by noon got a pretty good offing,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> about nine leagues from Cape Vic|tory, which is on the north &s;hore. Thus we cleared the we&s;tern entrance of this Streight, which, in my opinion, is too dangerous for navigation; a deliverance which happened in the very cri&s;is of our fate, for almo&s;t immediately after|wards the wind came again to the S. W. and if it had con|tinued in that quarter, our de&s;truction would have been inevitable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age from Cape Pillar, at the We&s;tern Entrance of the Streight of Magellan, to Ma&s;afuero; with &s;ome Account of that I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>I TOOK my departure from Cape Pillar,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> which I make to lie in the latitude of 52&deg; 45&prime; S., and in the longitude 75&deg; 10&prime; W. of the meridian of London, and as &s;oon as I got clear of the Streight, &s;teered to the northward along the coa&s;t of Chili. Upon examining what quantity of fre&s;h water we had now on board, I found that it amounted only to between four and five and twenty tons, which I thought not &s;ufficient for &s;o long a voyage as was probably before us; I therefore hauled to the northward, intending to make the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes, or Ma&s;afuero, that we might increa&s;e our &s;tock before we &s;ailed to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>In the middle of the night of the 16th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> we had the wind fir&s;t to the S. S. E. and then to the S. E. with which we kept away N. W. and N. N. W. in high &s;pirits, hoping that in a &s;hort time we &s;hould be in a more temperate climate; we had the mi&s;fortune, however, very &s;oon to find our&s;elves di&s;appointed, for on the 18th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 18" UNIT="day"> the wind came to the N. N. W. and blew directly from the point upon which we were &s;teering. We had now got about a hundred leagues from the Streight's mouth; our latitude was 48&deg; 39&prime; S., and we were, by account, 4&deg; 33&prime; W. of Cape Pillar; but from this time, till the 8th of May, the wind continued unfavourable, and blew a continued &s;torm, with &s;udden gu&s;ts &s;till more
<PB N="538" REF="378">
violent,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 18" UNIT="day"> and much rain and hail, or rather fragments of half melted ice: at intervals al&s;o we had thunder and lightning, more dreadful than all the pa&s;t, and a &s;ea which frequently laid the whole ve&s;&s;el under water.</P>
<P>From the time of our clearing the Streight, and during our pa&s;&s;age along this coa&s;t, we &s;aw a great number of &s;ea birds, particularly albatro&s;&s;es, gannets, &s;heerwaters, and a thick lumpi&s;h bird, about as big as a large pigeon, which the &s;ailors call a Cape of Good Hope hen: they are of a dark brown or blacki&s;h colour, and are therefore &s;ometimes called the black gull: we &s;aw al&s;o a great many pintado birds, of nearly the &s;ame &s;ize, which are prettily &s;potted with black and white, and con&s;tantly on the wing, though they frequently appear as if they were walking upon the water, like the peterels, to which &s;ailors have given the name of Mother Carey's chickens; and we &s;aw al&s;o many of the&s;e.</P>
<P>In the evening of Monday the 27th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 27" UNIT="day"> which was very dark, as we were &s;tanding to the we&s;tward under our cour&s;es, and a clo&s;e reefed top-&s;ail, the wind, in a hard &s;quall, &s;uddenly &s;hifted, and took the ve&s;&s;el right ahead; the violent jerk with which the &s;ails were in&s;tantly thrown a-back, was very near carrying the ma&s;ts away by the board, and over&s;etting the &s;hip: the &s;ails being at this time extremely wet, and the gale in the highe&s;t degree violent, they clung &s;o fa&s;t to the ma&s;ts and rigging, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to get them either up or down; yet by the dexterous activity of our people, we got the main-&s;ail up, clewed up the main top-&s;ail, and got the &s;hip's head round without receiving much damage. The violence of the wind continued &s;everal hours, but before morning it veered again to the N. W. and con|tinued in that quarter till the afternoon of the 29th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 29" UNIT="day"> when
<PB N="539" REF="379">
it died away, and we had a dead calm for &s;ix hours.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 9" UNIT="day"> During this time we had a high &s;ea, which ran in great confu&s;ion from all quarters, and broke again&s;t the &s;hip in a &s;trange manner, making her roll with &s;o violent and &s;udden a motion, that I expected every moment to lo&s;e our ma&s;ts. The wind afterwards &s;prung up at W. S. W. which was fair, and we carried all the &s;ail we could &s;et to make the mo&s;t of it. It blew very hard in this direction, with heavy rain for a few hours, but by noon on the 30th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 30" UNIT="day"> it returned to its u&s;ual quarter, the N. W. and was &s;o violent as to bring us again under our cour&s;es, there being at the &s;ame time a pro|digious &s;well, which frequently broke over us.<MILESTONE N="May" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Friday 1" UNIT="day"> At five o'clock the next morning, as we were lying to under the reefed main-&s;ail and balanced mizen, a va&s;t &s;ea broke over the quarter where the &s;hip's oars were la&s;hed, and carried away &s;ix of them, with the weather-cloth; it al&s;o broke the mizen gaff clo&s;e where the &s;ail was reefed, and the iron &s;trap of one of the main dead eyes, laying the whole ve&s;&s;el for &s;ome time under water: we were however fortunate enough to haul up the main &s;ail without &s;plitting, though it blew a hurricane, and a deluge of rain, or rather of half melted ice, at the &s;ame time poured down upon us. The wind &s;oon after &s;hifted again from N. W. to S. W. and for about an hour blew, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;tronger than ever. This wind made the &s;hip come up with her head right again&s;t the va&s;t &s;ea which the north we&s;t wind had rai&s;ed, and at every pitch which &s;he made again&s;t it, the end of the bow&s;prit was under water, and the &s;urge broke over the foreca&s;tle as far aft as the main-ma&s;t, in the &s;ame manner as it would have broke over a rock, &s;o that there was the greate&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend &s;he would founder. With all her defects &s;he was indeed a good &s;ea boat, and if &s;he had not, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for her to have outlived this &s;torm, in which,
<PB N="540" REF="380">
as well as on &s;everal other occa&s;ions,<MILESTONE N="Friday 1" UNIT="day"> we experienced the be|nefit of the bulk-heads which we had fixed on the fore-part of the half deck, and to the after-part of the foreca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this wind was fair, we dur&s;t not venture to put the &s;hip before it, for if in wearing, any of the&s;e enor|mous &s;eas had broken on her &s;ide, it would inevitably have carried away all before it. After &s;ome time, however, it became more moderate, and we then got up our yards and made &s;ail, &s;teering N. by W.; and now the men having been up all night, and being wet to the &s;kin, I ordered every one of them a dram.</P>
<P>By the next morning, the 2d of May,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 2" UNIT="day"> the wind came again to the N. W. and N. N. W. but by this time we had got down the broken mizen gaff, repaired it as well as we could, got it up again in its place, and bent the &s;ail to it; but we now mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt the want of a forge and iron.</P>
<P>On the 3d,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 3" UNIT="day"> at day-break, we found the rudder-chain broken, and upon this occa&s;ion we again mo&s;t feelingly re|gretted the want of a forge; we made, however, the be&s;t &s;hift we could,<MILESTONE N="Monday 4" UNIT="day"> and the next day, the weather being more moderate, though the wind was &s;till contrary, we repaired our rigging, and the carpenters fixed a new dead eye where the old one had been broken; the &s;ail-maker al&s;o was bu&s;y in mending the &s;ails that had been &s;plit.</P>
<P>On the 5th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 5" UNIT="day"> we were again brought under our cour&s;es by a hurricane from the N. by W. and N. N. W. and the &s;hip was to&s;&s;ed about with &s;uch violence that we had no command of her. During this &s;torm, two of our chain-plates were broken, and we continued toiling in a confu&s;ed hollow &s;ea till midnight, when a light gale &s;prung up at N. W. which &s;oon blew very hard; <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 6" UNIT="day"> but at two in the morning, we were again taken right ahead by a &s;udden and violent &s;quall at

we&s;t, which at once threw all our &s;ails aback,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 6" UNIT="day"> and before we could get the &s;hip round, was very near carrying all by the board. With this gale we &s;tood north, and in the forenoon the carpenters fixed new chain-plates to the main &s;hrouds, and one to the fore &s;hrouds, in the place of tho&s;e which had been broken in the &s;quall during the night. This was an|other occa&s;ion on which it was impo&s;&s;ible not to regret the want of a forge and iron.</P>
<P>The gale continued in this direction till eight in the morn|ing of the 7th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 7" UNIT="day"> when it returned to the N. W. with un&s;ettled weather. On the 8th, it came to &s;outh,<MILESTONE N="Friday 8" UNIT="day"> and this was a fine day, the fir&s;t we had &s;een after our leaving the Streight of Magellan. Our latitude at noon was 36&deg; 39&prime; S., and we were about five degrees to the we&s;tward of Cape Pillar.<MILESTONE N="Saturday 9" UNIT="day"> <MILESTONE N="Sunday 10" UNIT="day"> The next day we made the i&s;land of Ma&s;afuero, and on the 10th, the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes: in the afternoon we got clo&s;e to the ea&s;termo&s;t part of it, and &s;oon after hauled round the north end, and opened Cumberland Bay. As I did not know that the Spaniards had fortified this i&s;land, I was greatly &s;urprized to &s;ee a con&s;iderable number of men about the beach, with a hou&s;e and four pieces of cannon near the water-&s;ide, and a fort about three hundred yards farther from the &s;ea, ju&s;t upon the ri&s;ing of the hill, with Spani&s;h colours flying on the top of it. This fort, which is faced with &s;tone, has eighteen or twenty embra&s;ures, and within it a long hou&s;e, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be barracks for the gar|ri&s;on: five and twenty or thirty hou&s;es of different kinds are &s;cattered round it, and we &s;aw much cattle feeding on the brow of the hills, which &s;eemed to be cultivated, as many &s;pots were divided by enclo&s;ures from each other; we &s;aw al&s;o two large boats lying on the beach. The gu&s;ts of wind which came right out of this bay, prevented my going &s;o near as I intended, for they were &s;o violent as to oblige us
<PB N="542" REF="382">
many times to let fly our top-&s;ail &s;heets,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 10" UNIT="day"> though the &s;ails were clo&s;e reefed; and I think it is impo&s;&s;ible to work a &s;hip into this bay when the wind blows hard from the &s;outh|ward. As we &s;tood cro&s;s the bay to the we&s;tward, one of the boats put off from the &s;hore, and rowed towards us; but perceiving that the gu&s;ts, or flaws, made us lie at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the land, &s;he went in again. We then opened We&s;t Bay, on the ea&s;t part of which, clo&s;e to the &s;ea &s;ide, is a &s;mall hou&s;e, which I took for a guard-hou&s;e, and two pieces of cannon mounted upon their carriages, without any works about them. We now wore, and &s;tood again for Cumberland Bay, but as &s;oon as we opened it, the boat again put off, and made towards us: as the hard gu&s;ts would not permit us to come any nearer to the land than before, we &s;tood along it to the ea&s;tward, the boat &s;till making after us till &s;he was very far out of the bay: at length it grew dark, and we lo&s;t &s;ight of her, upon which we made all the &s;ail we could to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>During all this time I hoi&s;ted no colours, having none but Engli&s;h on board, which at this time I did not think it proper to &s;hew.</P>
<P>As I was di&s;appointed of wood and water at this place, and of the refre&s;hments, of which, after the dangers and fatigue of our voyage through the Streight, and our pa&s;&s;age from it,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 12" UNIT="day"> we &s;tood in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing need, I made all the &s;ail I could for the i&s;land of Ma&s;afuero. On the 12th of May we arrived off the &s;outh ea&s;termo&s;t part of it, but it blowing hard, with a great &s;ea, we did not dare to come near it on this &s;ide, and therefore went round to the we&s;t &s;ide, where, in the evening, we ca&s;t anchor upon an excellent bank, &s;it to receive a fleet of &s;hips, which, in the &s;ummer, might ride here with great advantage. I &s;ent out both the boats to en|deavour
<PB N="543" REF="383">
to get &s;ome water,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 12" UNIT="day"> but they found it impo&s;&s;ible to land, for the beach is rocky, and the &s;urf at this time was &s;o great, that the &s;wimmers could not get through the breakers: this was the more mortifying, as we &s;aw a fine run of fre&s;h water from the &s;hip, with plenty of trees &s;it for fire-wood, and a great number of goats upon the hills.</P>
<P>The next morning, as &s;oon as it was light,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 13" UNIT="day"> I &s;ent the boats out again, to examine any place where they could get on &s;hore. They returned with a few ca&s;ks of water, which they had filled at a &s;mall rill, and reported, that the wind being at S.

<P>We continued here till the 15th, at day-break, and then,<MILESTONE N="Friday 15" UNIT="day"> the weather becoming more moderate, we weighed, and in the evening, ju&s;t at &s;un-&s;et, we anchored on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, in the &s;ame place where Commodore Byron had anchored about two years before. We lo&s;t no time, but immediately got off fifteen ca&s;ks of water, and &s;ent a num|ber of men on &s;hore with others, that were empty, to be filled again&s;t the next morning, and a &s;trong party to cut wood:<MILESTONE N="Saturday 16" UNIT="day"> but it happened that about two o'clock in the morning a hard gale of wind came on from the N. W. with violent gu&s;ts from the &s;hore, which drove us off the bank, though we had two anchors ahead, which were in the utmo&s;t danger of being lo&s;t; we got them up, however, with great difficulty, and immediately &s;et the &s;ails, and worked under the lee of the i&s;land, keeping as near the &s;hore as we could; the weather &s;oon afterwards became more moderate, &s;o that we could carry double reefed top-&s;ails; we had al&s;o very &s;mooth water, yet we could not make the &s;hip tack, and were forced to wear her every time we wanted to go about.</P>
<P><PB N="544" REF="384">At day-break,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 16" UNIT="day"> though we were at a good di&s;tance from the &s;hore, I &s;ent the cutter to get off a load of water, before the &s;urf &s;hould be &s;o great upon the beach as to prevent her landing. About ten o'clock, the wind came to the N. N. E. which enabled us to get within a little di&s;tance of the water|ing-place, and we might have recovered our anchoring ground upon the bank from which we had been driven, but the weather had &s;o bad an appearance, and the gale fre&s;hened &s;o fa&s;t, that we did not think it prudent to venture: we brought to, however, as near the &s;hore as po&s;&s;ible, for the advantage of &s;mooth water to unload the cutter, which &s;oon after came along-&s;ide with twelve ca&s;ks of water. As &s;oon as we had taken the&s;e on board, I &s;ent the cutter again for another freight, and as we were at a very little di&s;tance from land, I ventured to &s;end our long-boat, a clum&s;ey, heavy, four-oared ve&s;&s;el, with provi&s;ions for the people on &s;hore, and orders to bring back a load of water, if &s;he could get it: as &s;oon as the&s;e boats were di&s;patched, we made a tack off to keep our ground. At noon it blew hard, with heavy rain and thick weather, and at one, as we were &s;tanding in again, we &s;aw the boats running along the &s;hore, for the lee part of the i&s;land, this &s;ide being open to the wind; we therefore followed them, and brought to as near the &s;hore as po&s;&s;ible, to favour their coming on board: they pre&s;ently made toward us, and we hoi&s;ted them in, but the &s;ea was now ri&s;en &s;o high, that in going it they received con&s;iderable damage, and we &s;oon learnt that they found the &s;urf &s;o great as not to be able even to land their empty water ca&s;ks. We continued to lie to, under a balanced mizen, off the lee part or the i&s;land all the afternoon, and although all hands had been con&s;tantly employed ever &s;ince the &s;hip had been driven off her anchoring ground, the carpenters worked all night in repairing the boats.</P>
<P><PB N="545" REF="385">At four o'clock in the morning, the i&s;land bore we&s;t of us,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 17" UNIT="day"> being four leagues di&s;tant, and right to windward: we had now a fine gale and &s;mooth water, and about ten o'clock we fetched very near to the &s;outh part of it, and with the help of the boat made the &s;hip tack. As it was not probable that with &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el we could regain the anchoring-ground, I took advantage of our being &s;o near the &s;hore, though at a good di&s;tance from the watering-place, to &s;end the cutter for another load. In the mean time I &s;tood on and off with the &s;hip, and about four o'clock in the after|noon the cutter brought her freight of water on board. I enquired of the Lieutenant after the people on &s;hore, and he told me, that the violent rain which had fallen in the night, had &s;uddenly brought down &s;uch torrents of water through the hollow or gully where they had taken up their &s;tation, that they were in the utmo&s;t danger of being &s;wept away before it, and though with great difficulty they &s;aved them|&s;elves, &s;everal of the ca&s;ks were intirely lo&s;t. It was now too late for the boat to make another turn to the place where we had hitherto got our water; but Mr. Era&s;mus Gower, the Lieutenant, who&s;e diligence and ability in all our dangers and di&s;tre&s;s I cannot &s;ufficiently commend, having, as he returned with the cutter, ob&s;erved that many runs of water had been made by the night's rain, on that part of the i&s;land which was neare&s;t to us, and knowing how impatient I was of delay, offered to go thither with the boat, and fill as many ca&s;ks as &s;he could bring back. I gladly accepted this offer, Mr. Gower went away in the boat, and in the mean time I made a tack off with the &s;hip; but before they had been gone an hour, the weather began to grow gloomy, and the wind to fre&s;hen, a heavy black cloud at the &s;ame time &s;ettled over the i&s;land &s;o as to hide the tops of the hills, and &s;oon after it began to thunder and lighten at a dreadful

rate:<MILESTONE N="Sunday 17" UNIT="day"> as the&s;e appearances were very threatening, I &s;tood in again towards the i&s;land in hopes of meeting with the boat; but though we ran in as clo&s;e as we dur&s;t, we &s;aw nothing of her. In the mean time night came on, which the thick|ne&s;s of the weather rendered extremely dark, the gale in|crea&s;ed, and it began to rain with great violence: in this &s;ituation I lay to under a balanced mizen, firing guns, and burning fal&s;e fires, as a guide to the boat; and not being able to account for her delay, I &s;uffered the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful anxiety, and had indeed but too much rea&s;on to fear that &s;he was lo&s;t. About &s;even o'clock, however, to my un|&s;peakable &s;atisfaction &s;he came &s;afe along&s;ide, and as I had long &s;een a &s;torm gathering, which I expected every mo|ment to bur&s;t upon us, we got her in with all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition. It was indeed happy for us all that no time was lo&s;t, for before &s;he could be got into her place, the &s;quall came on, which in a moment laid the &s;hip down in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, and broke the mizen gaff ju&s;t where the &s;ail was reefed; &s;o that if another minute had pa&s;&s;ed before the boat had been got in, we mu&s;t inevitably have lo&s;t her, and every &s;oul on board would have peri&s;hed. This wind and wea|ther continued till midnight, when it became &s;omewhat more moderate, &s;o that we were able to &s;et our cour&s;es and top-&s;ails. In the mean time I had enquired of Mr. Gower how it came to be &s;o long before he returned to the &s;hip, and he told me, that after he had got to the place where he intended to fill the ca&s;ks, three of the boat's crew had &s;wum a&s;hore with them for that purpo&s;e; but that within a few minutes, the &s;urf had ri&s;en &s;o high, and broke with &s;uch fury on the &s;hore, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to get back to the boat: that being unwilling to leave them behind, e&s;pecially as they were &s;tark naked, he had waited in hopes that an opportunity might be found for their coming on

board; <MILESTONE N="Sunday 17" UNIT="day"> but that being intimidated by the appearance of the weather, and the uncommon darkne&s;s of the night, he had at la&s;t, with whatever reluctance, been obliged to come on board without them. The &s;ituation of the&s;e poor fellows now furni&s;hed another &s;ubject of &s;olicitude and anxiety; they were naked, upon a de&s;olate i&s;land, at a great di&s;tance from the watering-place where their &s;hip-mates had a tent, without food, and without &s;helter, in a night of violent and ince&s;&s;ant rain, with &s;uch thunder and lightning as in Europe is altogether unknown. In the evening of the 19th, how|ever, I had the &s;atisfaction to receive them on board, and to hear an account of their adventures from their own lips. As long as it was light they flattered them&s;elves, like their friends in the boat, that they &s;hould find an opportunity to return on board her; but afterwards when the darkne&s;s of the night was broken only by the fla&s;hes of lightning, and the tempe&s;t became every moment more violent, they knew that to reach the boat was impo&s;&s;ible, if it &s;till remained in its &s;tation; and that mo&s;t probably the people on board had provided for their own &s;afety, by returning on board the &s;hip: to reach the tent of their &s;hip-mates, during the dark|ne&s;s and tempe&s;t, was equally beyond their power, and they were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a night, in &s;uch a place, without the lea&s;t defence again&s;t either the rain or the cold, which now began to be &s;everely felt. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity is &s;aid to be ingenious, and they contrived to pro|cure a temporary &s;uccedaneum both for apparel and a &s;hed, by lying one upon another, each man alternately placing him&s;elf between the other two; in this &s;ituation it may ea&s;ily be believed that they longed mo&s;t ardently for the dawn, and as &s;oon as it appeared they &s;et out for the tent: they were obliged however to make their way along the &s;ea &s;hore, for the inland country was impa&s;&s;able; nor was this the wor&s;t,
<PB N="548" REF="388">
for they were frequently &s;topped by high &s;teep bluff points,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 17" UNIT="day"> which they were obliged to &s;wim round at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, for if they had not taken a compa&s;s, they would have been da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the rocks by the &s;urf, and as it was, they were every moment in danger of being devoured by a &s;hark. About ten o'clock in the morning, however, they reached the tents, almo&s;t peri&s;hed with hun|ger and cold, and were received with equal &s;urpri&s;e and joy by their &s;hip-mates, who immediately &s;hared with them &s;uch provi&s;ions and clothes as they had. When they came on board, I gave orders that they &s;hould have &s;uch refre&s;h|ments as were proper, and remain in their hammocks the whole night. The next day they were as hearty as if no|thing had happened, nor did they &s;uffer any farther incon|venience from the accident. The&s;e were three of the hone&s;t fellows who had &s;wum naked from the &s;hip at the i&s;land of Madeira to get a &s;kinful of liquor. I now return to my nar|rative in the order of time.</P>
<P>On the 18th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 18" UNIT="day"> the weather was moderate, and in the even|ing we were within half a mile of the anchoring-ground from which we had been driven; but the wind &s;uddenly failing, and a current making again&s;t us, we could not reach it: we took advantage however of being &s;o near the waterer's tent to &s;end a boat on &s;hore to enquire after the three men who&s;e adventure has been ju&s;t related, and &s;oon after &s;he brought them on board. The carpenters were all this time employed in making a new mizen-gaff, out of a gib-boom, and in the mean while we were obliged to make &s;hift with the old one, keeping the &s;ail balanced. It conti|nued a &s;tark calm all the night,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> &s;o that in the morning we found the current and the &s;well had driven us no le&s;s than nine miles from the land: the weather however being good,
<PB N="549" REF="389">
I &s;ent the cutter for a load of water,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 19" UNIT="day"> which &s;he brought on board about one o'clock. Soon after a breeze &s;prung up at N. N. W. and as we now approached the land very fa&s;t, I &s;ent the boat on &s;hore again for water; it happened however that before we could reach our anchoring-ground, it again fell calm, and we were again kept off by the current: the boat in the mean time, as &s;he rowed along the &s;hore, caught as much fi&s;h with hook and line as &s;erved all the &s;hip's company, which was &s;ome alleviation of our di&s;appointment. At eight o'clock in the evening, it began again to blow hard with &s;udden &s;qualls, &s;o that we pa&s;&s;ed another toil|&s;ome and dangerous night. In the morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 20" UNIT="day"> having a &s;tiff gale at N. W. we made towards our anchoring-ground with all the &s;ail we could &s;pread, and happily regained it about four o'clock in the afternoon, when we anchored, at two cables' length from the beach, in eighteen fathom, with a bottom of fine &s;and, and moored with a &s;mall anchor in &s;hore. By the time the &s;hip was properly &s;ecured, it was too late to proceed with our watering; the long-boat however was &s;ent along the &s;hore to fi&s;h, and though before &s;even o'clock it blew &s;o hard that &s;he was obliged to return, &s;he brought fi&s;h enough on board to &s;erve all the people. In the night we had foul weather, with hard &s;qualls and much rain; and in the morning,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 21" UNIT="day"> the wind blowing with great violence along the &s;hore, we frequently drove, though we had not le&s;s than two hundred fathom of cable out; for the bank is a loo&s;e fine &s;and that ea&s;ily gives way. We rode out the &s;torm however without damage, but the rain was &s;o vio|lent, and the &s;ea ran &s;o high, that nothing could be done with the boats, which was the more mortifying as it was for the &s;ake of completing our watering that we had en|dured almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant labour far five days and nights to re|gain the &s;ituation in which we now lay. About eight in the
<PB N="550" REF="390">
evening,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 21" UNIT="day"> the wind became more moderate, and though it was then too late to fetch off any water, we got out one of the boats, and &s;ent three men on &s;hore, right abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, to kill &s;eals, and make oil of their fat, for burning in lamps and other u&s;es on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>The wind blew very hard the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Friday 22" UNIT="day"> as it had done all night, but being at W. N. W. which was off the land, we &s;ent the boats away &s;oon after it was light, and about ten, they returned with each of them a load of water, and a great number of pintado birds: the&s;e birds they got from the people on &s;hore, who told them, that when a gale of wind happened in the night they flew fa&s;ter into their fire than they could well take them out, &s;o that during the gale of the la&s;t night, they got no le&s;s than &s;even hundred of them. The boats were employed in getting water on board all this day, although the &s;urf was &s;o great that &s;eve|ral of the ca&s;ks were &s;taved and lo&s;t: they were &s;ent out again a little before it was light the next day,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 23" UNIT="day"> and by &s;even o'clock a few ca&s;ks only were wanting to complete our &s;tock. The threatening appearances of the weather made me now very impatient to get the people on board, with the ca&s;ks that were &s;till at the watering-place; as &s;oon therefore as the boats were cleared of their loading, I di&s;patched them again, with orders to bring off all the hands, with the tent, and every thing el&s;e that was on &s;hore, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. From this time the wind increa&s;ed, very fa&s;t, and by eleven o'clock it blew &s;o hard, with violent gu&s;ts from the land, that the &s;hip began to drive off the bank: we heaved the &s;mall anchor up, and got it in out of the way of the other; the gale &s;till increa&s;ed, but as it was right off the land, I was in no pain about the &s;hip, which continued to drive, &s;till dragging the an|chor through the &s;and, with two hundred fathom of cable
<PB N="551" REF="391">
out; <MILESTONE N="Saturday 23" UNIT="day"> for being very &s;olicitous to give the boats time to bring all on board before we were quite off the bank, I would not weigh. At two o'clock, however, the anchor was quite off the ground, and the &s;hip was in deep water; we were now therefore obliged to bring the cable to the cap&s;tern, and with great difficulty we got the anchor up. The gu&s;ts off the land were &s;o violent that, not daring to &s;how any canvas, we lay to under our bare poles, and the water was frequently torn up, and whirled round in the air much higher than our ma&s;ts heads. As the &s;hip now drove from the i&s;land at a great rate, and night was coming on, I began to be in great pain for the boats, in which, be&s;ides my Lieutenant, there were eight and twenty of my be&s;t men; but ju&s;t in the du&s;k of the evening, I perceived one of them &s;cud|ding before the &s;eas and making towards the &s;hip: this proved to be the longboat, which in &s;pight of all the efforts of tho&s;e on board, had been forced from her grappling, and driven off the land. We took the be&s;t opportunity that of|fered to get her on board, but notwith&s;tanding all our care, &s;he received con&s;iderable damage as we were hoi&s;ting her in. She had on board ten of my people, who informed me, that when they were fir&s;t driven from the &s;hore, they had &s;ome fire wood on board, but that they were obliged to throw that, and every thing el&s;e, into the &s;ea, to lighten the boat. As we had yet &s;een nothing of the cutter, and had rea&s;on to fear that &s;he al&s;o, with the tents, and the other eighteen people, be&s;ides the Lieutenant, had been driven off the i&s;land, I gave her up for lo&s;t; knowing that if the night, which was now at hand, &s;hould overtake her in &s;uch a &s;torm &s;he mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. It was however po&s;&s;ible that the people might be a&s;hore, and therefore that if the boat &s;hould be lo&s;t, they might &s;till be pre&s;erved; for this rea&s;on, I determined to regain the land as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. At mid|night,
<PB N="552" REF="392">
the weather became more moderate,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 24" UNIT="day"> &s;o that we could carry our cour&s;es and top&s;ails, and at four o'clock in the morning we crowded all the &s;ail we could make. At ten o'clock, we were very near the &s;hore; to our great concern, we &s;aw nothing of the cutter, yet we continued to &s;tand on till about noon, when we happily di&s;covered her at a grap|pling, clo&s;e under the land: we immediately ran to our gla&s;&s;es, by the help of which we &s;aw the people getting into her, and about three o'clock, to our mutual and inexpre&s;|&s;ible joy, &s;he came &s;afe on board with all her people: they were however &s;o exhau&s;ted with fatigue, that they could &s;carcely get up the &s;hip's &s;ide. The Lieutenant told me, that the night before he had attempted to come off, but that as &s;oon as he had left the &s;hore, a &s;udden &s;quall &s;o nearly filled the boat with water that &s;he was very near going to the bottom; but that all hands bailing with the utmo&s;t dili|gence and activity, they happily cleared her: that he then made for the land again, which, with the utmo&s;t difficulty, he regained, and having left a &s;ufficient number on board the boat, to watch her, and keep her free from water, he with the re&s;t of the people went on &s;hore. That having pa&s;&s;ed the night in a &s;tate of inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety and di&s;|tre&s;s, they looked out for the &s;hip with the fir&s;t dawn of the morning, and &s;eeing nothing of her, concluded that &s;he had peri&s;hed in the &s;torm, which they had never &s;een exceeded. They did not however &s;it down torpid in de&s;pair, but began immediately to clear the ground near the beach of bru&s;hes and weeds, and cut down &s;everal trees of which they made rollers to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in hauling up the boat, in order to &s;e|cure her; intending, as they had no hope of the &s;hip's re|turn, to wait till the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and then attempt to make the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes. They had now better hopes, and all &s;en&s;e of the dangers that were before us

was for a while obliterated by the joy of our e&s;cape from tho&s;e that were pa&s;t.</P>
<P>From the 16th, when we were fir&s;t driven from our an|choring ground, to this time, we &s;uffered an uninterrupted &s;eries of danger, fatigue, and misfortunes. The &s;hip worked and &s;ailed very ill, the weather was dark and tempe&s;tuous, with thunder, lightning, and rain, and the boats, which I was obliged to keep always employed, even when we were under &s;ail, to procure us water, were in continual danger of being lo&s;t, as well by the hard gales which con&s;tantly blew, as by the &s;udden gu&s;ts which frequently ru&s;hed upon us with a violence that is &s;carcely to be conceived. This di&s;tre&s;s was the more &s;evere as it was unexpected, for I had expe|rienced very different weather in the&s;e parts about two years before with Commodore Byron. It has generally been thought, that upon this coa&s;t the winds are con&s;tantly from the S. to the S. W. though Frazier mentions his having had &s;trong gales and high &s;eas from the N. N. W. and N. W. quarter, which was unhappily my ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Having once more got my people and boats &s;afe on board, I made &s;ail from this turbulent climate, and thought my&s;elf fortunate not to have left any thing behind me except the wood, which our people had cut for firing.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Ma&s;afuero lies in latitude 33&deg; 45&prime; S., longitude 80&deg; 46&prime; W. of London. Its &s;ituation is we&s;t of Juan Fernandes, both being nearly in the &s;ame latitude, and by the globe, it is di&s;tant about thirty-one leagues. It is very high and moun|tainous, and at a di&s;tance appears like one hill or rock: it is of a triangular form, and about &s;even or eight leagues in cir|cumference. The &s;outh part, which we &s;aw when we fir&s;t made the i&s;land, at the di&s;tance of three and twenty leagues,
<PB N="554" REF="395">
is much the highe&s;t: on the north end there are &s;everal &s;pots of clear ground, which perhaps might admit of cultivation.</P>
<P>The author of the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage men|tions only one part of this i&s;land as affording anchorage, which is on the north &s;ide, and in deep water, but we &s;aw no part where there was not anchorage: on the we&s;t &s;ide in particular there is anchorage at about a mile from the &s;hore in twenty fathom, and at about two miles and a half in forty, and forty-five fathom, with a fine black &s;and at the bottom. This author al&s;o &s;ays, that "there is a reef of rocks running off the ea&s;tern point of the i&s;land about two miles in length, which may be &s;een by the &s;ea's breaking over them;" but in this he is mi&s;taken, there is no reef of rocks, or &s;hoal running off the ea&s;tern point, but there is a reef of rocks and &s;and running off the we&s;tern &s;ide, near the &s;outh end of it. He is al&s;o mi&s;taken as to the di&s;tance of this i&s;land from Juan Fernandes, and its direction, for he &s;ays the di&s;tance is twenty-two leagues, and the direction W. by S., but we found the di&s;tance nearly one-third more, and the direction is due we&s;t, for, as I have before ob&s;erved, the latitude of both i&s;lands is nearly the &s;ame. The goats that he mentions we found upon it in the &s;ame abundance, and equally ea&s;y to be caught.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh we&s;t point of the i&s;land there is a remarkable rock, with a hole in it, which is a good mark to come to an anchor on the we&s;tern &s;ide, where there is the be&s;t bank of any about the place. About a mile and a half to the north|ward of this hole, there is a low point of land, and from this point runs the reef that has been ju&s;t mentioned, in the di|rection of W. by S. to the di&s;tance of about three quarters of a mile, where the &s;ea continually breaks upon it. To an|chor,
<PB N="555" REF="396">
run in till the hole in the rock is &s;hut in, about a cable's length upon this low point of land, then bearing S. by E. &frac12; E. and anchor in twenty and twenty-two fathom, fine black &s;and and &s;hells: there is anchorage al&s;o at &s;everal places on the other &s;ides of the i&s;land, particularly off the north point, in fourteen and fifteen fathom, with fine &s;and.</P>
<P>There is plenty of wood and water all round the i&s;land, but they are not to be procured without much difficulty, a great quantity of &s;tones, and large fragments of the rock have fallen from the high land all round the i&s;land, and upon the&s;e there breaks &s;uch a &s;urf that a boat cannot &s;afely come within a cable's length of the &s;hore; there is therefore no landing here but by &s;wimming from the boat, and then mooring her without the rocks, nor is there any method of getting off the wood and water but by hauling them to the boat with ropes: there are however many places where it would be very ea&s;y to make a commodious landing by build|ing a wharf, which it would be worth while even for a &s;ingle &s;hip to do if &s;he was to continue any time at the i&s;land.</P>
<P>This part of Ma&s;afuero is a very good place for refre&s;h|ment, e&s;pecially in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on: the goats have been mentioned already, and there is all round the i&s;land &s;uch plenty of fi&s;h, that a boat may, with three hooks and lines, catch as much as will &s;erve an hundred people: among others we caught excellent coal fi&s;h, cavallies, cod, hallibut, and crayfi&s;h. We took a king-fi&s;her that weighed eighty-&s;even pounds, and was five feet and an half long, and the &s;harks were &s;o ravenous, that when we were &s;ounding one of them &s;wallowed the lead, by which we hauled him above water, but as he then di&s;gorged it, we lo&s;t him. The &s;eals were &s;o numerous, that I verily think if many thou&s;ands of
<PB N="556" REF="397">
them were killed in a night, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed in the morning: we were obliged to kill great numbers of them, as, when we walked the &s;hore, they were continually running again&s;t us, making at the &s;ame time a mo&s;t hor|rible noi&s;e. The&s;e animals yield excellent train oil, and their hearts and plucks are very good eating, being in ta&s;te &s;omething like tho&s;e of a hog, and their &s;kins are covered with the fine&s;t fur I ever &s;aw of the kind. There are many birds here, and among others &s;ome very large hawks. Of the pintado birds, our people, as I have before ob&s;erved, caught no le&s;s than &s;even hundred in one night. We had not much opportunity to examine the place for vegetable productions, but we &s;aw &s;everal leaves of the mountain cab|bage, which is a proof that the tree grows here.</P>

<P>WHEN we took our departure from Ma&s;afuero, we had a great &s;ea from the N. W. with a &s;well of long billows from the &s;outhward, and the wind, which was from the S. W. to the W. N. W. obliged me to &s;tand to the north|ward, in hope of getting the &s;outh ea&s;t trade-wind, for the &s;hip was &s;o dull a &s;ailer, that there was no making her go without a &s;trong wind in her favour. Having thus run farther to the northward than at fir&s;t I intended, and finding my&s;elf not far from the parallel of latitude which has been a&s;&s;igned to two i&s;lands called Saint Ambro&s;e, and Saint Felix or Saint Paul, I thought I &s;hould perform an acceptable &s;er|vice by examining if they were fit for &s;hipping to refre&s;h at, e&s;pecially as the Spaniards having fortified Juan Fernandes, they might be found convenient for Great Britain, if &s;he &s;hould hereafter be engaged in a Spani&s;h war. The&s;e i&s;lands are laid down in Green's charts, which were publi&s;hed in the year 1753, from latitude 26&deg; 20&prime;, to 27&deg; S. and from 1&deg; &frac14; to 2&deg; &frac12; W. of Ma&s;afuero; I therefore hauled up with a de&s;ign to keep in that latitude, but &s;oon afterwards con&s;ulting Robert|&s;on's Elements of Navigation, I found the i&s;land of Saint Ambro&s;e there laid down in latitude 25&deg; 30&prime; S., and 82&deg; 20&Prime; longitude we&s;t of London, and &s;uppo&s;ing that i&s;lands of &s;o
<PB N="558" REF="399">
&s;mall an extent, might be laid down with more exactne&s;s in this work than in the chart, I bore away more northward for that latitude; the event, however, proved that I &s;hould not have tru&s;ted him &s;o far: I mi&s;&s;ed the i&s;lands, and as I &s;aw great numbers of birds and fi&s;h, which are certain indica|tions of land not far off, there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to con|clude that I went to the northward of them. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that upon a farther examination of Robert&s;on's tables of latitudes and longitudes, I found them erroneous in many particulars: this cen&s;ure, however, if I had not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to prevent future mi&s;chief, &s;hould have been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Upon examining the account that is given by Wafer, who was Surgeon on board Captain Davis's &s;hip, I think it is pro|bable that the&s;e two i&s;lands are the land that Davis fell in with in his way to the &s;outhward from the Gallapago i&s;lands, and that the land laid down in all the &s;ea charts under the name of Davis's Land, has no exi&s;tence, notwith&s;tanding what is &s;aid in the account of Roggewein's voyage, which was made in 1722, of land that they called Ea&s;tern I&s;land, which &s;ome have imagined to be a confirmation of Davis's di&s;covery, and the &s;ame land to which his name has been given.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t from Wafer's narrative, that little credit is due to the account kept on board Davis's &s;hip, except with re&s;pect to the latitude, for he acknowledges that they had like to have peri&s;hed by their making an allowance for the variation of the needle we&s;tward, in&s;tead of ea&s;tward: he tells us al&s;o that they &s;teered S. by E. &frac12; E. from the Gallapa|gos, till they made land in latitude 27&deg; 20&prime; S. but it is evident that &s;uch a cour&s;e would carry them not to the we&s;tward but to the ea&s;tward of the Gallapagos, and &s;et them at about the
<PB N="559" REF="400">
di&s;tance of two hundred leagues from Capiapo, and not five hundred leagues as he has alleged, for the variation here is not more than half a point to the ea&s;tward now, and it mu&s;t have been &s;till le&s;s then, it having been increa&s;ing to the ea&s;tward on all this coa&s;t. The cour&s;e that Davis &s;teered therefore, if the di&s;tance between the i&s;lands of St. Ambro&s;e and St. Felix, and the Gallapagos, as laid down in all our &s;ea charts, is right, mu&s;t have brought him within &s;ight of St. Ambro&s;e and St. Felix, when he had run the di&s;tance he mentions. The truth is, that if there had been any &s;uch place as Davis's Land in the &s;ituation which has been allotted to it in our &s;ea charts, I mu&s;t have &s;ailed over it, or at lea&s;t have &s;een it, as will appear in the cour&s;e of this narrative.</P>
<P>I kept between the latitude 25&deg; 50&prime; and 25&deg; 30&prime;, in &s;earch of the i&s;lands I intended to examine, till I got five degrees to the we&s;tward of our departure, and then &s;eeing no land, and the birds having left us, I hauled more to the &s;outhward, and got into latitude 27&deg; 20&prime; S. where I continued till we got between &s;eventeen and eighteen degrees to the we&s;tward of our departure. In this parallel we had light airs and &s;oul winds, with a &s;trong northerly current, which made me conjecture that we were near this Davis's Land, for which we looked out with great diligence, but a fair wind &s;pringing up again, we &s;teered we&s;t by &s;outh, which gradually brought us into the latitude of 28&deg; &frac12; S. &s;o that it is evident I mu&s;t have &s;ailed over this land, or at lea&s;t have &s;een it if there had been any &s;uch place.

The people had hitherto enjoyed good health, but they now began to be affected with the &s;curvy. While we were in the Streight of Magellan, I cau&s;ed a little awning to be made, which I covered with a clean painted canvas, that had been allowed me for a floor-cloth to my cabbin, and with this we caught &s;o much rain water, with but little trouble or attendance, that the people were never put to a &s;hort allowance of this important article: the awning al&s;o afforded &s;helter from the inclemency of the weather, and to the&s;e precautions I imputed our having e&s;caped the &s;curvy &s;o long, though perhaps it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to the mixture of &s;pirit of vitriol with the water that was thus pre|&s;erved, our Surgeon putting a &s;mall quantity into every ca&s;k when it was filled up.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 11th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 11" UNIT="day"> we di&s;covered a &s;mall, low, flat i&s;land, which appeared to be almo&s;t level with the water's edge, and was covered with green trees: as it was to the &s;outh, and directly to windward of us, we could not fetch it.

The men now began to be very &s;ickly, the &s;curvy having made great progre&s;s among them, and as I found that all my endea|vours to keep in a high &s;outhern latitude at this time, were ineffectual, and that the badne&s;s of the weather, the vari|ablene&s;s of the winds, and above all the defects of the &s;hip, rendered our progre&s;s &s;low, I thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to fix upon that cour&s;e which was mo&s;t likely to pre&s;erve the ve&s;&s;el and the crew; in&s;tead therefore of attempting to return back by the &s;outh ea&s;t, in which, con&s;idering our condition, and the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould &s;ucceed, I bore away to the northward, that I might get into the trade-wind, keeping &s;till in &s;uch a track as, if the charts were to be tru&s;ted, was mo&s;t likely to bring me to &s;ome i&s;land, where the refre&s;hments of which we &s;tood &s;o much in need might be procured; intending then, if the &s;hip could be put into a proper condition, to have pur|&s;ued the voyage to the &s;outhward, when the fit &s;ea&s;on &s;hould return, to have attempted farther di&s;coveries in this track; and, if I &s;hould di&s;cover a continent, and procure a &s;ufficient &s;upply of provi&s;ions there, to keep along the coa&s;t to the &s;outhward till the &s;un had cro&s;&s;ed the equinoctial, and then, getting into a high &s;outhern latitude, either have gone we&s;t about to the Cape of Good Hope, or returned to the ea&s;t|ward, and having touched at Falkland's I&s;lands if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, made the be&s;t of my way from thence back to Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="565" REF="407">When I got into latitude 16&deg; S. and not before,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 22" UNIT="day"> I found the true trade-wind; and as we proceeded to the north we&s;t, and the northward, we found the variation increa&s;e very fa&s;t; for when we had advanced to latitude 18&deg; 15&prime; S. and were in longitude 80&deg; &frac14; W. of our departure, it was 7&deg; 30&prime; E.

At this time it blew &s;o hard that, although we went before the wind, we were obliged to reef our top&s;ails, and the weather was &s;till very thick and rainy. The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 26" UNIT="day"> being in latitude 10&deg; S., longitude 167&deg; W. we kept nearly in the &s;ame pa|rallel, in hopes to have fallen in with &s;ome of the i&s;lands called Solomon's I&s;lands, this being the latitude in which the &s;outhermo&s;t of them is laid down.

It was not our good fortune however to fall in with any land; probably we might pa&s;s near &s;ome, which the thick weather prevented our &s;eeing; for in this run great num|bers of &s;ea-birds were often about the &s;hip: however, as Commodore Byron in his la&s;t voyage &s;ailed over the north|ern limits of that part of the ocean in which the i&s;lands of Solomon are &s;aid to lie, and as I &s;ailed over the &s;outhern limits without &s;eeing them, there is great rea&s;on to con|clude
<PB N="566" REF="408">
that,<MILESTONE N="Monday 3" UNIT="day"> if there are any &s;uch i&s;lands, their &s;ituation in all our charts is erroneou&s;ly laid down.</P>
<P>From the latitude 14&deg; S., longitude 163&deg; 46&prime; W. we had a &s;trong gale from the S. E. which made a great &s;ea after us, and from that time I did not ob&s;erve the long billows from the &s;outhward till we got into latitude 10&deg; 18&prime; S., longitude 177&deg; 30&prime; E. and then it returned from the S. W. and S. S. W. and we found a current &s;etting to the &s;outhward, although a current in the contrary direction had attended us almo&s;t all the way from the Streight of Magellan; I conjectured therefore that here the pa&s;&s;age opened between New Zea|land and New Holland. The variation here was 11&deg; 14&prime; E. On the 5th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 5" UNIT="day"> being in latitude 10&deg; &frac12; S., longitude 175&deg; 44&prime; E.; the variation was 11&deg; 15&prime; E.; <MILESTONE N="Saturday 8" UNIT="day"> and on the 8th, in latitude 11&deg; S., longitude 171&deg; 14&prime; E. it was 11&deg; &frac12; E.</P>
<P>About this time we found our &s;tock of log-lines nearly expended, though we had already converted all our fi&s;hing lines to the &s;ame u&s;e. I was &s;ome time in great perplexity how to &s;upply this defect, but upon a very diligent enquiry found that we had, by chance, a few fathom of thick untarred rope. This, which in our &s;ituation was an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure, I ordered to be untwi&s;ted; but as the yarns were found to be too thick for our purpo&s;e, it became nece&s;&s;ary to pick them into oakham: and when this was done, the mo&s;t difficult part of the work remained; for this oakham could not be &s;pun into yarn, till, by combing, it was brought into hemp, its original &s;tate. This was not &s;eamen's work, and if it had, we &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s how to perform it for want of combs; one difficulty therefore ro&s;e upon another, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to make combs, before we could try our &s;kill in making hemp. Upon this trying oc|ca&s;ion we were again &s;en&s;ible of the danger to which we
<PB N="567" REF="409">
were expo&s;ed by the want of a forge: nece&s;&s;ity, however, the fruitful mother of invention, &s;ugge&s;ted an expedient. The armourer was &s;et to work to file nails down to a &s;mooth point, with which we produced a tolerable &s;uccedaneum for a comb; and one of the Quarterma&s;ters was found &s;uf|ficiently &s;killed in the u&s;e of this in&s;trument to render the oakham &s;o &s;mooth and even that we contrived to &s;pin it into yarn, as fine as our coar&s;e implements would admit; and thus we made tolerable log-lines, although we found it much more difficult than to make cordage of our old cables, after they had been converted into junk, which was an ex|pedient that we had been obliged to practi&s;e long before. We had al&s;o long before u&s;ed all our &s;ewing &s;ail twine, and if, knowing that the quantity with which I had been &s;upplied was altogether inadequate to the wants of &s;uch a voyage, I had not taken the whole quantity that had been put on board to repair the &s;eine into my own cu&s;tody, this defi|ciency might have been fatal to us all.</P>

<P>Having con&s;idered this account, and finding that a &s;well, which came round the ea&s;tern part of the bay, would ren|der watering trouble&s;ome and inconvenient, exclu&s;ive of the danger that might be apprehended from the natives, if they &s;hould attack us from ambu&s;hes in the wood, I determined to try whether a better &s;ituation could not be found.</P>
<P>The next morning, therefore, as &s;oon as it was light,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> I di&s;patched the Ma&s;ter with fifteen men in the cutter, well armed and provided, to examine the coa&s;t to the we&s;tward, our pre&s;ent &s;ituation being on the lee of the i&s;land, for a place where we might more conveniently be &s;upplied with wood and water, and at the &s;ame time procure &s;ome refre&s;h|ments for the &s;ick, and lay the &s;hip by the &s;tern to examine and &s;top the leak. I gave him &s;ome beads, ribbons, and other trifles, which by chance I happened to have on board, to conciliate the good-will of the natives, if he &s;hould hap|pen to meet with any of them; but at the &s;ame time en|joined him to run no ri&s;k, and gave him particular orders immediately to return to the &s;hip if any number of canoes &s;hould approach him which might bring on ho&s;tilities; and if he &s;hould meet the Indians in &s;mall parties, either at &s;ea
<PB N="570" REF="413">
or upon &s;hore,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> to treat them with all po&s;&s;ible kindne&s;s, &s;o as to e&s;tabli&s;h a friendly intercour&s;e with them; charging him, on no account to leave the boat him&s;elf, nor to &s;uffer more than two men to go on &s;hore at a time, while the re&s;t &s;tood ready for their defence; recommending to him, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, an application to his duty, without regard|ing any other object, as the finding a proper place for the &s;hip was of the utmo&s;t importance to us all; and conjuring him to return as &s;oon as this &s;ervice &s;hould be performed, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed.</P>
<P>Soon after I had di&s;patched the cutter on this expedition, I &s;ent the longboat with ten men on board well armed to the &s;hore, who before eight o'clock brought off a tun of water.

<P>Our men had not long returned on board, when we &s;aw three of the natives &s;it down under the trees abrea&s;t of the &s;hip. As they continued there gazing at us till the afternoon, as &s;oon as the cutter came in &s;ight, not caring that both the boats &s;hould be ab&s;ent at the &s;ame time, I &s;ent my Lieute|nant in the longboat, with a few beads, ribbons, and trin|kets, to endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome kind of intercour&s;e with them, and by their means with the re&s;t of the inhabitants; the&s;e men, however, before the boat could reach the &s;hore, quitted their &s;tation, and proceeded along the beach. As the trees would &s;oon prevent their being &s;een by our people who were making towards the land, we kept our eyes fixed upon them from the &s;hip, and very &s;oon perceived that they

were met by three others. After &s;ome conver&s;ation,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> the fir&s;t three went on, and tho&s;e who met them proceeded towards the boat with a ha&s;ty pace. Upon this I made the &s;ignal to the Lieutenant to be upon his guard, and as &s;oon as he &s;aw the Indians, ob&s;erving that there were no more than three, he backed the boat in to the &s;hore, and making &s;igns of friend&s;hip, held up to them the beads and ribbons which I had given him as pre&s;ents, our people at the &s;ame time carefully concealing their arms. The Indians, however, taking no notice of the beads and ribbons, re&s;olutely advanced within bow-&s;hot, and then &s;uddenly di&s;charged their arrows, which happily went over the boat without doing any mi&s;chief; they did not prepare for a &s;econd di&s;charge, but in&s;tantly ran away into the woods, and our people di&s;charged &s;ome mu&s;quets after them, but none of them were wounded by the &s;hot. Soon after this happened, the cutter came under the &s;hip's &s;ide, and the fir&s;t per&s;on that I particularly noticed was the Ma&s;ter, with three arrows &s;ticking in his body. No other evidence was nece&s;&s;ary to convict him of having acted con|trary to my orders, which appeared indeed more fully from his own account of the matter, which it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e was as favourable to him&s;elf as he could make it. He &s;aid, that having &s;een &s;ome Indian hou&s;es with only five or &s;ix of the inhabitants, at a place about fourteen or fifteen miles to the we&s;tward of the &s;hip's &s;tation, where he had &s;ounded &s;ome bays, he came to a grappling, and veered the boat to the beach, where he landed with four men, armed with mu&s;quets and pi&s;tols: that the Indians at fir&s;t were afraid of him, and retired, but that &s;oon after they came down to him, and he gave them &s;ome beads and other trifles, with which they &s;eemed to be much plea&s;ed: that he then made &s;igns to them for &s;ome cocoa-nuts, which they brought him, and with great appearance of friend&s;hip and
<PB N="572" REF="415">
ho&s;pitality,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> gave him a broiled fi&s;h and &s;ome boiled yams: that he then proceeded with his party to the hou&s;es, which, he &s;aid, were not more than fifteen or twenty yards from the water &s;ide, and &s;oon after &s;aw a great number of canoes coming round the we&s;tern point of the bay, and many In|dians among the trees: that being alarmed at the&s;e appear|ances, he ha&s;tily left the hou&s;e where they had been re|ceived, and with the men, made the be&s;t of his way towards the boat; but that, before he could get on board, the In|dians attacked as well tho&s;e that were with him as tho&s;e that were in the boat, both from the canoes and the &s;hore. Their number, he &s;aid, was between three and four hundred; their weapons were bows and arrows, the bows were &s;ix feet five inches long, and the arrows four feet four, which they di&s;charged in platoons, as regularly as the be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops in Europe: that it being nece&s;&s;ary to defend him&s;elf and his people when they were thus attacked, they fired among the Indians to favour their getting into their boat, and did great execution, killing many and wounding more: that they were not however di&s;couraged, but continued to pre&s;s forward, &s;till di&s;charging their arrows by platoons in almo&s;t one continued flight: that the grappling being foul, occa&s;ioned a delay in hauling off the boat, during which time he, and half of the boat's crew, were de&s;perately wounded: that at la&s;t they cut the rope, and ran off under their fore&s;ail, &s;till keeping up their fire with blunderbu&s;&s;es, each loaded with eight or ten pi&s;tol balls, which the Indians returned with their arrows, tho&s;e on &s;hore wading after them brea&s;t high into the &s;ea: when they had got clear of the&s;e, the canoes pur&s;ued them with great fortitude and vigour, till one of them was &s;unk, and the numbers on board the re&s;t greatly reduced by the fire, and then they returned to the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="573" REF="416">Such was the &s;tory of the Ma&s;ter, who,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 13" UNIT="day"> with three of my be&s;t &s;eamen, died &s;ome time afterwards of the wounds they had received; but culpable as he appears to have been by his own account, he appears to have been &s;till more &s;o by the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who &s;urvived him. They &s;aid, that the Indians behaved with the greate&s;t confidence and friend&s;hip till he gave them ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, by ordering the people that were with him, who had been regaled in one of their hou&s;es, to cut down a cocoa-nut tree, and in&s;i&s;ting upon the execution of his order, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;|plea&s;ure which the Indians &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed upon the oc|ca&s;ion: as &s;oon as the tree fell, all of them except one, who &s;eemed to be a per&s;on of authority, went away; and in a &s;hort time a great number of them were ob&s;erved to draw together into a body among the trees, by a Mid&s;hipman who was one of the party that were on &s;hore, and who im|mediately acquainted the Ma&s;ter with what he had &s;een, and told him, that from the behaviour of the people he imagined an attack was intended: that the Ma&s;ter made light of the intelligence, and in&s;tead of repairing immediately to the boat, as he was urged to do, fired one of his pi&s;tols at a mark: that the Indian who had till that time continued with them then left them abruptly, and joined the body in the wood: that the Ma&s;ter, even after this, by an infatuation that is altogether unaccountable, continued to trifle away his time on &s;hore, and did not attempt to recover the boat till the attack was begun.</P>
<P>As the expedition to find a better place for the &s;hip had i&s;&s;ued thus unhappily, I determined to try what could be done, where we lay; the next day therefore,<MILESTONE N="Friday 14" UNIT="day"> the &s;hip was brought down by the &s;tern, as far as we could effect it, and the carpenter, the only one of the crew who
<PB N="574" REF="417">
was in tolerable health,<MILESTONE N="Friday 14" UNIT="day"> caulked the bows, as far down as he could come at the bottom; and though he did not quite &s;top the leak, he very much reduced it. In the afternoon a fre&s;h gale &s;et right into the bay, which made the &s;hip ride with her &s;tern very near the &s;hore, and we ob&s;erved a great number of the natives &s;culking among the trees upon the beach, who probably expected that the wind would have forced the &s;hip on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 15" UNIT="day"> the weather being fine, we veered the &s;hip clo&s;e in &s;hore, with a &s;pring upon our cable, &s;o that we brought our broad&s;ide to bear upon the watering-place, for the protection of the boats that were to be employed there. As there was rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the natives whom we had &s;een among the trees the night before, were not now far di&s;tant, I fired a couple of &s;hot into the wood, before I &s;ent the waterers a&s;hore; I al&s;o &s;ent the Lieutenant in the cutter, well manned and armed, with the boat that carried them, and ordered him and his people to keep on board, and lie clo&s;e to the beach to cover the watering-boat while &s;he was loading, and to keep di&s;charging mu&s;quets into the wood on each &s;ide of the party that were filling the water. The&s;e orders were well executed, the beach was &s;leep, &s;o that the boats could lie clo&s;e to the people that were at work, and the Lieutenant from the cutter fired three or four vollies of &s;mall arms into the woods before any of the men went on &s;hore, and none of the natives appearing, the waterers landed and went to work. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions, before they had been on &s;hore a quarter of an hour, a flight of arrows was di&s;charged among them, one of which dangerou&s;ly wounded a man that was filling water in the brea&s;t, and another &s;tuck into a bareca on which Mr. Pitcairn was &s;itting. The people on board the cutter imme|diately
<PB N="575" REF="418">
fired &s;everal vollies of &s;mall arms into that part of the wood from which the arrows came,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 15" UNIT="day"> and I recalled the boats that I might more effectually drive the Indians from their ambu&s;cades with grape-&s;hot from the &s;hip's guns. When the boats and people were on board, we began to fire, and &s;oon after &s;aw about two hundred men ru&s;h out of the woods, and run along the beach with the utmo&s;t precipita|tion. We judged the coa&s;t to be now effectually cleared, but in a little time we perceived that a great number had got together on the we&s;termo&s;t point of the bay, where they probably thought them&s;elves beyond our reach: to con|vince them therefore of the contrary, I ordered a gun to be fired at them with round &s;hot; the ball ju&s;t grazing the water ro&s;e again, and fell in the middle of them, upon which they di&s;per&s;ed with great hurry and confu&s;ion, and we &s;aw no more of them. After this we watered without any farther mole&s;tation, but all the while our boats were on &s;hore, we had the precaution to keep firing the &s;hip's guns into the wood on both &s;ides of them, and the cutter which lay clo&s;e to the beach, as &s;he did before, kept up a con&s;tant fire of &s;mall arms in platoons at the &s;ame time. As we &s;aw none of the natives during all this firing, we &s;hould have thought that none of them had ventured back into the wood, if our people had not reported that they heard groans from &s;everal parts of it, like tho&s;e of dying men.</P>
<P>Hitherto, though I had been long ill of an inflammatory and bilious di&s;order, I had been able to keep the deck; but this evening, the &s;ymptoms became &s;o much more threaten|ing that I could keep up no longer, and I was for &s;ome time afterwards confined to my bed. The Ma&s;ter was dying of the wounds he received in his quarrel with the Indians, the Lieutenant al&s;o was very ill, the Gunner and thirty of my men incapable of duty, among whom were &s;even of the
<PB N="576" REF="419">
mo&s;t vigorous and healthy,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 15" UNIT="day"> that had been wounded with the Ma&s;ter, and three of them mortally, and there was no hope of obtaining &s;uch refre&s;hments as we mo&s;t needed in this place. The&s;e were di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, and not only put an end to my hopes of pro&s;ecuting the voyage far|ther to the &s;outhward, but greatly di&s;pirited the people; ex|cept my&s;elf, the Ma&s;ter, and the Lieutenant, there was no body on board capable of navigating the &s;hip home; the Ma&s;ter was known to be a dying man, and the recovery of my|&s;elf and the Lieutenant was very doubtful. I would however have made a further effort to obtain refre&s;hments here, if I had been furni&s;hed with any toys, iron tools, or cutlery-ware, which might have enabled me to recover the good|will of the natives, and e&s;tabli&s;h a traffic with them for &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they could have furni&s;hed us with; but I had no &s;uch articles, and but very few others fit for an In|dian trade, and not being in a condition to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of any more of the few men who were capable of doing duty, I weighed anchor at day-break on Monday the 17th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 17" UNIT="day"> and &s;tood along the &s;hore for that part of the i&s;land to which I had &s;ent the cutter. To the i&s;land I had given the name of EGMONT ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Egmont I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of the Earl: it certainly is the &s;ame to which the Spaniards have given the name of Santa Cruz, as appears by the accounts which their writers have given of it, and I called the place in which we had lain, SWALLOW BAY. From the ea&s;termo&s;t point of this bay, which I called SWALLOW POINT, to the north ea&s;t point of the i&s;land which I called CAPE BYRON, is about &s;even miles ea&s;t, and from the we&s;termo&s;t point of the bay, which I called HANWAY's POINT, to Cape Byron, is about ten or eleven miles. Between Swallow Point and Hanway's Point, in the bottom of the bay, there is a third point, which does not run out &s;o far; and a little to the we&s;tward of this point

is the be&s;t anchoring-place,<MILESTONE N="Monday 17" UNIT="day"> but it is nece&s;&s;ary to give it birth, as the ground near it is &s;hoaly. When we were at anchor in this bay, Swallow Point bore E. by N. and Han|way's Point W. N. W. From this Point there runs a reef, on which the &s;ea breaks very high: the outer part of this reef bore N. W. by W. and an i&s;land which has the appearance of a volcano, was ju&s;t over the breakers. Soon after we had pa&s;&s;ed Hanway's Point, we &s;aw a &s;mall village, which &s;tands upon the beach, and is &s;urrounded by cocoa-nut trees. It is &s;ituated in a bay between Hanway's Point and another, to which I gave the name of HOW's POINT. The di&s;tance from Hanway's Point to How's Point is between four and five miles: clo&s;e to the &s;hore there is about thirty fathom of water, but in cro&s;&s;ing the bay at the di&s;tance of about two miles, we had no bottom. Having pa&s;&s;ed How's Point, we opened another bay, or harbour, which had the appearance of a deep lagoon, and which we called CARLISLE HARBOUR. Over-again&s;t the entrance of Carli&s;le Harbour, and north of the coa&s;t, we found a &s;mall i&s;land, which we called PORT|LAND's ISLAND. On the we&s;t &s;ide of this i&s;land there is a reef of rocks that runs to the main, the pa&s;&s;age into the harbour therefore is on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, and runs in and out E. N. E. and W. S. W.: it is about two cables' length wide, and has about eight fathom water. I believe the harbour within it to be good, but a &s;hip would be obliged to warp both in and out, and would after all be in danger of an attack by the natives, who are bold even to temerity, and have a per&s;e|verance which is not common among undi&s;ciplined &s;avages. When the &s;hip was a mile from the &s;hore, we had no ground with fifty fathom. About four or five miles we&s;t from Port|land's I&s;land, is a fine, &s;mall, round harbour, ju&s;t big enough to receive three &s;hips, which we called BYRON's HARBOUR. When we were abrea&s;t of the entrance of it, it
<PB N="578" REF="423">
bore from us S. by E. &frac12; E. and the Volcano I&s;land bore N. W. &frac12; W.<MILESTONE N="Monday 17" UNIT="day"> Our boat entered it, and found two runs of water, one fre&s;h and the other &s;alt; by the run of &s;alt water we judged that it had a communication with Carli&s;le Harbour. When we had proceeded about three leagues from the harbour, we opened the bay where the cutter had been attacked by the Indians, to which, for that rea&s;on, we gave the name of BLOODY BAY. In this Bay is a &s;mall rivulet of fre&s;h water, and here we &s;aw many hou&s;es regularly built: clo&s;e to the water-&s;ide &s;tood one much longer than any of the re&s;t, which &s;eemed to be a kind of common-hall, or council-hou&s;e, and was neatly built and thatched. This was the building in which our people had been received who were on &s;hore here with the Ma&s;ter, and they told me that both the &s;ides and floor were lined with a kind of fine matting, and a great number of arrows, made up into bundles, were hung up in it ready for u&s;e. They told me al&s;o, that at this place there were many gardens, or plantations, which were enclo&s;ed by a fence of &s;tone, and planted with cocoa-nut trees, bananas, plantains, yams, and other vegetables: the cocoa-nut trees we &s;aw from the &s;hip, in great numbers, among the hou&s;es of the village. About three miles to the we&s;tward of this town, we &s;aw another of con&s;iderable extent, in the front of which, next to the water-&s;ide, there was a brea&s;t-work of &s;tone, about four feet &s;ix inches high, not in a &s;trait line, but in angles, like a fortification; and there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, from the weapons of the&s;e people, and their military courage, which mu&s;t in great mea&s;ure be the effect of habit, that they have frequent wars among them&s;elves. As we proceeded we&s;t|ward from this place, we found, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles, a &s;mall bight, forming a kind of bay, in which a river empties it&s;elf. Upon taking a view of this river from the ma&s;t-head, it appeared to run very far into the country,
<PB N="579" REF="424">
and at the entrance, at lea&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Monday 17" UNIT="day"> to be navigable for &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els. This river we called GRANVILLE's RIVER, and to the we&s;tward of it is a point, to which we gave the name of FERRERS's POINT. From this point the land forms a large bay, and near it is a town of great extent, which &s;eemed to &s;warm like a bee-hive: an incredible multitude came out of it as the &s;hip pa&s;&s;ed by, holding &s;omething in their hands which looked like a whi&s;p of green gra&s;s, with which they &s;eemed to &s;troke each other, at the &s;ame time dancing, or running in a ring. About &s;even miles to the we&s;tward of Point Ferrers, is another, that was called CARTERET POINT, from which a reef of rocks, that appears above water, runs out to the di&s;tance of about a cable's length. Upon this point we &s;aw a large canoe, with an awning or &s;hade built over it; and a little to the we&s;tward, another large town, fronted, and probably &s;urrounded, with a brea&s;t-work of &s;tone like the la&s;t: here al&s;o the people thronged to the beach as the &s;hip was pa&s;&s;ing, and performed the &s;ame kind of circular dance. After a little time they launched &s;everal canoes, and made towards us; upon which we lay to, that they might have time to come up, and we conceived great hopes that we &s;hould prevail upon them to come on board, but when they came near enough to have a more di&s;tinct view of us, they lay upon their paddles and gazed at us, but &s;eemed to have no de&s;ign of advancing farther, and therefore we made &s;ail, and left them behind us. About half a mile from Carteret Point, we had &s;ixty fathom, with a bottom of &s;and and coral. From this point the land trends away W. S. W. and S. W. forming a deep lagoon, at the mouth of which lies an i&s;land, that with the main forms two entrances into it: the i&s;land we called TREVANION's ISLAND. This entrance is about two miles wide, and the lagoon, if there is anchorage in it, is certainly a fine harbour for &s;hip|ping.
<PB N="580" REF="425">
After cro&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t entrance,<MILESTONE N="Monday 17" UNIT="day"> and coming off the north we&s;t part of Trevanion's I&s;land, which we called CAPE TREVANION, we &s;aw a great rippling, and therefore &s;ent the boat off to &s;ound; we had, however, no bottom with fifty fathom, the rippling being cau&s;ed only by the meeting of the tides. Having hauled round this Cape, we found the land trend to the &s;outhward, and we continued to &s;tand along the &s;hore, till we opened the we&s;tern pa&s;&s;age into the lagoon between Trevanion's I&s;land and the main. In this place, both the main and the i&s;land appeared to be one con|tinued town, and the inhabitants were innumerable. We &s;ent a boat to examine this entrance or pa&s;&s;age, and found the bottom to be coral and rock, with very irregular &s;ound|ings over it. As &s;oon as the natives &s;aw the boat leave the &s;hip, they &s;ent off &s;everal armed canoes to attack her: the fir&s;t that came within bow-&s;hot di&s;charged her arrows at the people on board, who being ready, fired a volley, by which one of the Indians was killed, and another wounded; at the &s;ame time we fired a great gun from the &s;hip, loaded with grape-&s;hot, among them, upon which they all pulled back to the &s;hore with great precipitation, except the canoe which began the attack, and that being &s;ecured by the boat's crew, with the wounded man in her, was brought to the &s;hip. I immediately ordered the Indian to be taken on board, and the Surgeon to examine his wounds: it appeared that one &s;hot had gone through his head, and that his arm was broken by another: the Surgeon was of opinion that the wound in his head was mortal, I therefore ordered him to be put again into his canoe, and, notwith&s;tanding his con|dition, he paddled away towards the &s;hore. He was a young man, with a woolly head, like that of the negroes, and a &s;mall beard, but he was well-featured, and not &s;o black as the natives of Guinea: he was of the common &s;tature, and,
<PB N="581" REF="426">
like all the re&s;t of the people whom we had &s;een upon this i&s;land, quite naked. His canoe was very &s;mall,<MILESTONE N="Monday 17" UNIT="day"> and of rude workman&s;hip, being nothing more than part of the trunk of a tree made hollow; it had, however, an outrigger, but none of them had &s;ails.</P>
<P>We found this place to be the we&s;tern extremity of the i&s;land on the north &s;ide, and that it lay in exactly the &s;ame latitude as the ea&s;tern extremity on the &s;ame &s;ide. The di&s;|tance between them is about fifty miles due ea&s;t and we&s;t, and a &s;trong current &s;ets we&s;tward along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>I was &s;till confined to my bed, and it was with infinite re|gret that I gave up the hopes of obtaining refre&s;hments at this place, e&s;pecially as our people told me they &s;aw hogs and poultry in great plenty as we &s;ailed along the &s;hore, with cocoa-nut trees, plantains, bananas, and a variety of other vegetable productions, which would &s;oon have re&s;tored to us the health and vigour we had lo&s;t, by the fatigue and hard&s;hips of a long voyage; but no friendly intercour&s;e with the natives could now be expected, and I was not in a &s;itu|ation to obtain what I wanted by force. I was my&s;elf dan|gerou&s;ly ill, great part of my crew, as I have already ob&s;erved, was di&s;abled, and the re&s;t di&s;pirited by di&s;appoint|ment and vexation, and if the men had been all in health and &s;pirits, I had not officers to lead them on or direct them in any enterprize, nor even to &s;uperintend the duties that were to be performed on board the &s;hip. The&s;e di&s;advan|tages, which prevented my obtaining refre&s;hments at this i&s;land, prevented me al&s;o from examining the re&s;t that were near it. Our little &s;trength was every minute becoming le&s;s; I was not in a condition to pur&s;ue the voyage to the &s;outhward, and was in danger of lo&s;ing the mon&s;oon, &s;o that no time was now to be lo&s;t; I therefore gave orders to
<PB N="582" REF="427">
&s;teer northward,<MILESTONE N="Monday 17" UNIT="day"> hoping to refre&s;h at the country which Dampier has called <HI>Nova Britannia.</HI> I &s;hall, however, give the be&s;t account I can of the appearance and &s;ituation of the i&s;lands that I left behind me.</P>
<P>I gave the general name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE's ISLANDS to the whole clu&s;ter, as well to tho&s;e that I did not &s;ee di&s;tinctly, as to tho&s;e that I did; and I gave &s;everal of them particular names as I approached them.</P>
<P>To the &s;outhermo&s;t of the two, which when we fir&s;t di&s;|covered land were right ahead, I gave the name of LORD HOW's ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Lord How's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> and the other was Egmont I&s;land, of which &s;ome account has already been given. The latitude of Lord How's I&s;land is 11&deg; 10&prime; S., longitude 164&deg; 43&prime; E.: the latitude of Cape Byron, the north ea&s;t point of Egmont i&s;land, is 10&deg; 40&prime; S., longitude 164&deg; 49&prime; E. The ea&s;t &s;ides of the&s;e two i&s;lands, which lie exactly in a line with each other, about N. by W. and S. by E. including the pa&s;&s;age between them, extend about eleven leagues, and the pa&s;&s;age is about four miles broad; both of them appear to be fertile, and have a plea&s;ant appearance, being covered with tall trees, of a beautiful verdure. Lord How's I&s;land, though more flat and even than the other, is notwith&s;tanding high land. About thirteen leagues W. N. W. &frac12; N. by compa&s;s, from Cape Byron, there is an i&s;land of a &s;tupendous height, and a conical figure. The top of it is &s;haped like a funnel, from which we &s;aw &s;moke i&s;&s;ue, though no flame; it is, however, cer|tainly a volcano, and therefore I called it VOLCANO ISLAND.<MILESTONE N="Volcano I&s;land" UNIT="place"> To a long flat i&s;land that, when How's and Egmont's I&s;lands were right ahead, bore N.

The canoes that came out again&s;t us from the we&s;t end of the i&s;land, were all like that which our people brought on board, and might probably, upon occa&s;ion, carry about a dozen men, though three or four manage them with amazing dexterity: we &s;aw, how|ever, others of a large &s;ize upon the beach, with awnings or &s;hades over them.</P>
<P>We got two of their bows, and a bundle of their arrows, from the canoe that was taken with the wounded man; and with the&s;e weapons they do execution at an incredible di&s;|tance. One of them went through the boat's wa&s;hboard, and dangerou&s;ly wounded a mid&s;hipman in the thigh. Their arrows were pointed with flint, and we &s;aw among them no appearance of any metal. The country in general is woody and mountainous, with many vallies intermixed; &s;everal &s;mall rivers flow from the interior part of the coun|try into the &s;ea, and there are many harbours upon the coa&s;t. The variation here was about 11&deg; 15&prime; E.</P>

<P>WE made &s;ail from this i&s;land in the evening of Tue&s;day the 18th of Augu&s;t,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 18" UNIT="day"> with a fre&s;h trade-wind from the ea&s;tward, and a few &s;qualls at times.

<P>On the 20th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 20" UNIT="day"> we di&s;covered a &s;mall, flat, low i&s;land, and got up with it in the evening: it lies in latitude 7&deg; 56&prime; S., longitude 158&deg; 56&prime; E. and I gave it the name of GOWER's ISLAND.<MILESTONE N="Gower's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> To our great mortification we found no anchorage here, and could procure only a few cocoa-nuts from the in|habitants, who were much the &s;ame kind of people that we had &s;een at I&s;le Egmont, in exchange for nails, and &s;uch trifles as we had; they promi&s;ed, by &s;igns, to bring us more the next day, and we kept off and on all night: the night was extremely dark,<MILESTONE N="Friday 21" UNIT="day"> and the next morning, at day-break, we found that a current had &s;et us con&s;iderably to the &s;outh|ward of the i&s;land, and brought us within &s;ight of two more. They were &s;ituated nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t of each other, and were di&s;tant about two miles.

Carteret's I&s;land lies in about the latitude 8&deg; 26&prime; S., longitude 159&deg; 14&prime; E. and its length from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about &s;ix leagues: we found the variation here 8&deg; 30&prime; E. Both the&s;e i&s;lands were right to windward of us, and we bore down to Gower's I&s;land. It is about two leagues and a half long on the we&s;tern &s;ide, which makes in bays: the whole is well wooded, and many of the trees are cocoa-nut. We found here a con&s;iderable number of the Indians, with two boats or canoes, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to Carteret's I&s;land, and to have brought the people hither only to fi&s;h. We &s;ent the boat on &s;hore, which the natives endeavoured to cut off, and ho&s;tilities being thus commenced, we &s;eized their canoe, in which we found about an hundred cocoa-nuts, which were very acceptable; we &s;aw &s;ome turtle near the beach, but were not fortunate enough to take any of them. The canoe, or boat, was large enough to carry eight or ten men, and was very neatly built, with planks well jointed: it was adorned with &s;hell-work, and figures rudely painted, and the &s;eams were covered with a &s;ub&s;tance &s;omewhat like our black putty, but it appeared to me to be of a better con&s;i&s;tence. The people were armed with bows, arrows, and &s;pears; the &s;pears and arrows were pointed with flint. By &s;ome &s;igns which they made, pointing to our mu&s;kets, we imagined they were not wholly unacquainted with fire-arms. They are much the &s;ame kind of people as we had &s;een at Egmont I&s;land, and like them, were quite naked; but their canoes were of a very different &s;tructure, and a much larger &s;ize, though we did not di&s;cover that any of them had &s;ails. The cocoa-nuts which we got here, and at Egmont I&s;land, were of infinite advantage to the &s;ick.</P>
<P><PB N="586" REF="431">rom the time of our leaving Egmont I&s;land, we had ob|&s;erved a current &s;etting &s;trongly to the &s;outhward, and in the neighbourhood of the&s;e i&s;lands we found its force greatly increa&s;ed: this determined me, when I &s;ailed from Gower's I&s;land, to &s;teer N. W. fearing we might otherwi&s;e fall in with the main land too far to the &s;outhward; for if we had got into any gulph or deep bay, our crew was &s;o &s;ickly, and our &s;hip &s;o bad, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for us to have got out again.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock in the morning of the 22d,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 22" UNIT="day"> as we were continuing our cour&s;e with a fine fre&s;h gale, Patrick Dwyer, one of the marines, who was doing &s;omething over the &s;hip's quarter, by &s;ome accident mi&s;&s;ed his hold and fell into the &s;ea; we in&s;tantly threw overboard the canoe which we had &s;eized at Gower's i&s;land, brought the &s;hip to, and hoi&s;ted out the cutter with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, but the poor fellow, though remarkably &s;trong and healthy, &s;unk at once, and we &s;aw him no more. We took the canoe on board again, but &s;he had received &s;o much damage by &s;trik|ing again&s;t one of the guns, as the people were hoi&s;ting her overboard, that we were obliged to cut her up.</P>
<P>In the night of Monday the 24th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 24" UNIT="day"> we fell in with nine i&s;lands; they &s;tretch nearly N. W. by W. and S. E. by E. about fifteen leagues, and lie in latitude 4&deg; 36&prime; S., longitude 154&deg; 17&prime; E. according to the &s;hip's account. I imagine the&s;e to be the i&s;lands which are called Ohang Java, and were di&s;covered by Ta&s;man; for the &s;ituation an&s;wers very nearly to their place in the French chart, which in the year 1756 was corrected for the King's &s;hips. The other i&s;lands, Carteret's, Gower's, and Simp&s;on's, I believe had never been &s;een by an European navigator before. There is cer|tainly much land in this part of the ocean not yet known.</P>
<P><PB N="587" REF="432">One of the&s;e i&s;lands is of con&s;iderable extent,<MILESTONE N="Monday 24" UNIT="day"> the other eight are &s;carcely better than large rocks; but though they are low and flat, they are well covered with wood, and abound with inhabitants. The people are black, and woolly-headed, like the Negroes of Africa: their weapons are bows and arrows; and they have large canoes which they navi|gate with a &s;ail, one of which came near us, but would not venture on board.</P>
<P>We went to the northward of the&s;e i&s;lands, and &s;teered W. by S. with a &s;trong &s;outh we&s;terly current. At eleven o'clock at night, we fell in with another i&s;land of a con&s;ide|rable extent, flat, green, and of a plea&s;ant appearance; we &s;aw none of its inhabitants, but it appeared by the many fires which we &s;aw in the night to be well peopled.

<P>At day-break the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 25" UNIT="day"> we di&s;covered another large high i&s;land, which, ri&s;ing in three con&s;iderable hills, had, at a di&s;tance, the appearance of three i&s;lands.

<P>On the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 28" UNIT="day"> we anchored in a bay near a little i&s;land at the di&s;tance of about three leagues to the N. W. of Cape Saint George, which was called WALLIS's ISLAND.<MILESTONE N="Wallis's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> I found the latitude of this Cape to be about 5&deg; S. and its longitude by account 152&deg; 19&prime; E. which is about two thou&s;and five hundred leagues due we&s;t from the Continent of America, and about one degree and an half more to the ea&s;tward than its place in the French chart which has been ju&s;t mentioned. In the afternoon I &s;ent the cutter to examine the coa&s;t, and the other boat to get &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and hawl the &s;eine. The people in this boat caught no fi&s;h, but they brought on board about an hundred and fifty cocoa-nuts, which were di&s;tributed to the men at the &s;urgeon's di&s;cretion. We had &s;een &s;ome turtle as we were coming into the bay, and hop|ing that &s;ome of them might repair to the i&s;land in the night, e&s;pecially as it was &s;andy, barren, and uninhabited, like the places the&s;e animals mo&s;t frequent, I &s;ent a few men on &s;hore to watch for them,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 29" UNIT="day"> but they returned in the morn|ing without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

We therefore, with whatever reluc|tance, de&s;i&s;ted for the night, and the next day,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 30" UNIT="day"> having a little recruited our &s;trength, we were more &s;ucce&s;sful; we got the anchor up, but we found it &s;o much injured as to be wholly un&s;erviceable, the palm being broken.</P>
<P>From this place we &s;ailed to a little cove about three or four miles di&s;tant, to which we gave the name of ENGLISH COVE: here we anchored, and immediately began to get wood and water, which we found in great plenty, be&s;ides balla&s;t; I al&s;o &s;ent the boat out every day to different places with the &s;eine, but though there was plenty of fi&s;h, we were able to catch very little; a misfortune which was probably owing in part to the clearne&s;s of the water, in part to the rockine&s;s of the beach, and perhaps in &s;ome degree al&s;o to our want of &s;kill: we plied this labour day and night, notwith|&s;tanding the want of &s;ucce&s;s, and at the &s;ame time had re|cour&s;e to the hook and line, but to our great mortification not a &s;ingle fi&s;h would take the bait. We &s;aw a few turtle, but they were &s;o &s;hy that we could not catch one of them; here therefore we were condemned to the cur&s;e of Tantalus, perpetually in the &s;ight of what our appetites mo&s;t importu|nately craved, and perpetually di&s;appointed in our attempts to reach it. We got, however, from the rocks at low water, a few rock oy&s;ters, and cockles of a very large &s;ize; and from the &s;hore &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and the upper part of the tree that bears them, which is called the cabbage: this cab|bage
<PB N="590" REF="436">
is a white, cri&s;p, juicy &s;ub&s;tance, which, eaten raw, ta&s;tes &s;omewhat like a che&s;nut, but when boiled is &s;uperior to the be&s;t par&s;nip; we cut it &s;mall into the broth that we made of our portable &s;oup, which was afterwards thickened with oatmeal, and made a mo&s;t comfortable me&s;s: for each of the&s;e cabbages however we were forced to cut down a tree, and it was with great regret that we de&s;troyed, in the parent &s;tock, &s;o much fruit, which perhaps is the mo&s;t powerful anti&s;corbutic in the world; but nece&s;&s;ity has no law. This &s;upply of fre&s;h vegetables, and e&s;pecially the milk, or rather the water of the nut, recovered our &s;ick very fa&s;t. They al&s;o received great benefit and plea&s;ure from the fruit of a tall tree, that re&s;embles a plum, and particularly that which in the We&s;t Indies is called the Jamaica plum; our men gave it the &s;ame name; it has a plea&s;ant tarti&s;h ta&s;te, but is a little woody probably only for want of cul|ture: the&s;e plums were not plenty, &s;o that having the two qualities of a dainty, &s;carcity and excellence, it is no won|der that they were held in the highe&s;t e&s;timation.</P>
<P>The &s;hore about this place is rocky, and the country high and mountainous, but covered with trees of various kinds, &s;ome of which are of an enormous growth, and probably would be u&s;eful for many purpo&s;es. Among others, we found the nutmeg tree in great plenty, and I gathered a few of the nuts, but they were not ripe: they did not indeed ap|pear to be the be&s;t &s;ort, but perhaps that is owing partly to their growing wild, and partly to their being too much in the &s;hade of taller trees. The cocoa-nut tree is in great per|fection, but does not abound. Here are, I believe, all the different kinds of palm, with the beetle-nut tree, various &s;pecies of the aloe, canes, bamboos, and rattans, with many trees, &s;hrubs and plants altogether unknown to me; but no
<PB N="591" REF="437">
e&s;culent vegetable of any kind. The woods abound with pigeons, doves, rooks, parrots, and a large bird with black plumage, that makes a noi&s;e &s;omewhat like the barking of a dog; with many others which I can neither name nor de|&s;cribe. Our people &s;aw no quadruped but two of a &s;mall &s;ize that they took for dogs; the carpenter and another man got a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e of them in the woods as they were cutting &s;pars for the &s;hip's u&s;e, and &s;aid that they were very wild, and ran away the moment they &s;aw them with great &s;wiftne&s;s. We &s;aw centipieds, &s;corpions, and a few &s;erpents of different kinds; but no inhabitants. We fell in however with &s;everal de&s;erted habitations, and by the &s;hells that were &s;cattered about them, and &s;eemed not long to have been taken out of the water, and &s;ome &s;ticks half burnt, the re|mains of a fire, there is rea&s;on to conclude that the people had but ju&s;t left the place when we arrived. If we may judge of the people by that which had been their dwelling, they mu&s;t &s;tand low even in the &s;cale of &s;avage life; for it was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable hovel we had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>While we lay here, having cleared and lightened the &s;hip, we heeled her &s;o as to come at her leak, which the carpen|ter &s;topped as well as he could; we found the &s;heathing greatly decayed, and the bottom much eaten by the worms, but we payed it as far as we could get at it with a mixture of hot pitch and tar boiled together. The carpenter al&s;o cut down many &s;pars, for &s;tudding-&s;ail booms, having but few left of tho&s;e which he had brought from England.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h Cove lies N. E. &frac12; N. three or four miles from Wallis's I&s;land; there is a &s;mall &s;hoal on the &s;tarboard hand going in, which will be ea&s;ily &s;een by the &s;ea's breaking upon it. The water ebbs and flows once in four and twenty hours; the flood came in about nine or ten o'clock, and it
<PB N="592" REF="438">
was high water between three and four in the afternoon, after which it ebbed all night, and was low water about &s;ix in the morning. The water ri&s;es and falls between eight or nine feet, &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s; but I doubt whether this fluctuation is not rather the effect of the &s;ea and land breeze, than of a regular tide. We anchored here with our be&s;t bower in twenty-&s;even fathom water, with a bottom of &s;and and mud; we veered into the cove a cable and a half from the anchor, moored head and &s;tern with the &s;tream anchor, and &s;teadied with haw&s;ers on each bow; the &s;hip then lay in ten fathom, at the di&s;tance of a cable's length from the &s;hore at the bottom of the Cove, Wallis's Point bearing S. W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant about three or four miles. At this place there is plenty of excellent wood and water, and good &s;hingle balla&s;t. The variation was 6&deg; &frac12; E.</P>
<P>On Monday the 7th of September,<MILESTONE N="September" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 7" UNIT="day"> I weighed anchor, but before I &s;ailed, I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country, with all its i&s;lands, bays, ports, and harbours, for his Maje&s;ty George the Third, King of Great Britain; and we nailed upon a high tree a piece of board, faced with lead, on which was en|graved the Engli&s;h Union, with the name of the &s;hip, and her Commander, the name of the Cove, and the time of her coming in and &s;ailing out of it. While we lay here, I &s;ent the boat out to examine the harbours upon the coa&s;t, from one of which expeditions &s;he returned with a load of cocoa-nuts, which &s;he procured in a fine little harbour, about four leagues W. N. W. from the &s;tation we were in. The officer on board reported that the trees grew where he had gathered the fruit in great plenty; but as he had ob&s;erved that &s;eve|ral of them were marked, and that there were many huts of the natives near them, I did not think it proper that the boat &s;hould return: but the refre&s;hment which now offered
<PB N="593" REF="439">
was of &s;uch importance to the &s;ick,<MILESTONE N="Monday 7" UNIT="day"> that I determined to go into the harbour with the &s;hip, and place her &s;o as to pro|tect the men who &s;hould be employed to fell the trees, and cut off the cabbages and the fruit. We &s;ailed from Engli&s;h Cove with the land breeze early in the morning, and in the evening &s;ecured the &s;hip abrea&s;t of the grove, where the cocoa-nuts had been gathered, and at very little di&s;tance from the &s;hore. Here we procured above a thou&s;and cocoa-nuts, and as many of the cabbages as we could u&s;e while they were good, and I would have &s;taid long enough to have given my people all the refre&s;hments they wanted, but the &s;ea&s;on of the year made the &s;horte&s;t delay dangerous. There was too much rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the lives of all on board depended upon our getting to Batavia while the mon&s;oon continued to blow from the ea&s;tward; there was indeed time enough for any other &s;hip to have gone three times the di&s;tance, but I knew it was &s;carcely &s;ufficient for the Swallow in her pre&s;ent condition; and that if we &s;hould be obliged to continue here another &s;ea&s;on, it would probably become impo&s;&s;ible to navigate her at all, e&s;pecially as &s;he had but a &s;ingle &s;heathing, and her bottom was not filled with nails, &s;o that the worms would have eaten through it; be&s;ides that our provi&s;ion would long before that time have been totally exhau&s;ted. I therefore weighed anchor and quitted this &s;tation, which was much the be&s;t that had been our lot during the whole run from the Streight of Magellan, on the 9th in the morning, at break of day,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 9" UNIT="day"> with a light breeze from the land.</P>
<P>To this place we gave the name of CARTERET's HARBOUR; it is about W. N. W. four leagues from Engli&s;h Cove, and formed by two i&s;lands and the main; the large&s;t, which is to the N. W. we called COCOA-NUT ISLAND, and the other,<MILESTONE N="Cocoa-nut I&s;land" UNIT="place">
<PB N="594" REF="440">
which is to the S.

The north we&s;t, or lee entrance, is formed by Cocoa-nut I&s;land, and this is the be&s;t, becau&s;e there is good anchorage in it, the water in the other being too deep: we entered the harbour by the &s;outh ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, and went out of it by the north we&s;t. At the &s;outh ea&s;t end of the harbour there is a large cove, which is &s;ecure from all winds, and fit to haul a &s;hip into. Into this cove a river &s;eemed to empty it&s;elf, but our boats did not examine it. In the north we&s;t part of the harbour there is another cove, which our boat did examine, and from which &s;he brought us very good water: this al&s;o is fit for a &s;hip to haul into, and very convenient for wooding and watering: &s;he may lie in any depth from thirty to five fathom, and at any di&s;tance from the &s;hore, with a bottom of &s;oft mud. The harbour runs about S. E. by S. and N. W. by N. and is about three miles long, and four cables' length broad. We anchored in thirty fathom, near the north we&s;t entrance, and abrea&s;t of the trees on Cocoa-nut I&s;land.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Di&s;covery of a Streight dividing the Land called Nova Britannia into two I&s;lands, with a De&s;cription of &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands that lie in the Pa&s;&s;age, and the Land on each Side, with the Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we got about four leagues off the land,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 9" UNIT="day"> after leaving this harbour, we met with a &s;trong gale at E. S. E. a direction ju&s;t contrary to that which would have favoured our getting round the land, and dou|bling Cape Saint Maria. We found at the &s;ame time a &s;trong current, &s;etting us to the N. W. into a deep bay or gulph, which Dampier calls Saint George's Bay, and which lies between Cape Saint George and Cape Orford. As it was impo&s;&s;ible to get round the land, again&s;t both the wind and current, and follow the track of Dampier, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of attempting a pa&s;&s;age to the we&s;tward by this gulph, and the current gave me hopes that I &s;hould &s;ucceed. When I had got, therefore, about five miles to the &s;outh we&s;t of Cocoa-nut I&s;land, I &s;teered to the N.W. and the N. N. W. as the land trends, and had &s;oon good rea&s;on to believe that what has been called Saint George's Bay, and thought to be formed by two points of the &s;ame i&s;land, was indeed a channel between two i&s;lands, and &s;o the event proved it to be.</P>
<P>Before it was dark, we found this channel divided by a pretty large i&s;land which I called the DUKE OF YORK's ISLAND,
<PB N="596" REF="444">
and &s;ome &s;maller i&s;lands that were &s;cattered about it.<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 9" UNIT="day"> On the &s;outhermo&s;t &s;ide of the main, or the large&s;t of the two i&s;lands that are divided by the channel or &s;treight, which I left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its ancient name, New Britain, there is &s;ome high land, and three remarkable hills clo&s;e to each other, which I called the MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS. The Mother is the middlemo&s;t and large&s;t, and behind them we &s;aw a va&s;t column of &s;moke, &s;o that probably one of them is a volcano: they are ea&s;ily &s;een in clear weather at the di&s;tance of twenty leagues, and will then, by tho&s;e who do not know them, be taken for i&s;lands: they &s;eem to lie far inland and the Mother bears about we&s;t from the Duke of York's I&s;land. To the ea&s;t of the&s;e hills there is a point making like a cape land, which I called CABE PALLISER; and another to the we&s;tward, which I called CAPE STEPHENS. Cape Stephens is the northermo&s;t part of New Britain. North of this Cape is an i&s;land, which I called the ISLE OF MAN.<MILESTONE N="I&s;le of Man" UNIT="place"> Cape Palli&s;er and Cape Stephens bear about N. W. and S. E. of each other; and between them is a bay, the land of which near the water-&s;ide is low, plea&s;ant, and level, and gradually ri&s;es, as it retires to|wards the Mother and Daughters, into very lofty hills, in general covered with va&s;t woods, but having many clear &s;pots like plantations intermixed. Upon this part of the country we &s;aw many fires in the night, and have therefore rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it is well inhabited. The Duke of York's I&s;land lies between the two points, Cape Palli&s;er and Cape Stephens. As it was not &s;afe to attempt either of the pa&s;|&s;ages into which the Streight was divided by this i&s;land in the dark, we brought to for the night, and kept &s;ounding, but had no ground with one hundred and forty fathom. The Streight here, including the two pa&s;&s;ages, is about fif|teen leagues broad. The land of the Duke of York's I&s;land
<PB N="597" REF="445">
is level, and has a delightful appearance:<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 9" UNIT="day"> inland it is co|vered with lofty woods, and near the water-&s;ide are the hou&s;es of the natives, which &s;tand not far from each other, among groves of cocoa-nut trees, &s;o that the whole forms a pro&s;pect the mo&s;t beautiful and romantic that can be ima|gined. We &s;aw many of their canoes, which are very neatly made, and in the morning, &s;oon after I made &s;ail,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 10" UNIT="day"> &s;ome of them came off towards the &s;hip; but as we had a fre&s;h gale at that time, we could not &s;tay for them. The latitude of this i&s;land is 4&deg; 9&prime; S., longitude 151&deg; 20&prime; E.; and it is five and twenty leagues di&s;tant from Cape George. As I coa&s;ted not New Britain, but the northermo&s;t coa&s;t of the Streight, I pa&s;&s;ed through the pa&s;&s;age that is formed by that coa&s;t, and the corre&s;ponding &s;ide of the Duke of York's I&s;land, which is about eight leagues broad, and may be con&s;idered as the Fir&s;t Narrow of the Streight; and then &s;teering N. W. by W. all night,<MILESTONE N="Friday 11" UNIT="day"> we found at day-break that we had lo&s;t &s;ight of the &s;outhermo&s;t i&s;land, or New Britain, and having now a&s;certained the &s;uppo&s;ed bay to be a Streight, I called it SAINT GEORGE's CHANNEL,<MILESTONE N="St. George's Channel" UNIT="place"> <MILESTONE N="New Ireland" UNIT="place"> and to the northern i&s;land I gave the name of NOVA HIBERNIA, or NEW IRELAND. The wea|ther being hazey, with a &s;trong gale and &s;udden gu&s;ts, I continued to &s;teer along the coa&s;t of New Ireland at about the di&s;tance of &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore, till I came off the we&s;t end of it, and then, altering our cour&s;e, I &s;teered W. N. W. I could plainly perceive, that we were &s;et along the &s;hore by a &s;trong we&s;terly current. At noon, we found by ob&s;ervation that we were much to the northward of the log; but as it was impo&s;&s;ible the current could &s;et due north, as that would be right again&s;t the land, I was obliged, for the correction of my account, to allow no le&s;s than four and twenty miles W. N. W. which is nearly as the land lies along the &s;hore. At this time we had about half a point
<PB N="598" REF="446">
ea&s;t variation; <MILESTONE N="Friday 11" UNIT="day"> and at night we di&s;covered a fine large i&s;land, forming a &s;treight or pa&s;&s;age with New Ireland. As it was very dark and &s;qually, with rain, we brought to, not know|ing to what danger the navigation of this &s;treight might expo&s;e us. The night was tempe&s;tuous, with much thun|der and lightning,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 12" UNIT="day"> but about two in the morning the wea|ther cleared: the gu&s;ts &s;ettled into a light breeze, and the the moon &s;hone very bright. At this time therefore we made &s;ail again, and found a &s;trong current &s;etting us to the we&s;tward, through the pa&s;&s;age of the Second Narrow, which is about five leagues wide. The i&s;land, which has a plea&s;ant appearance, and is very populous, I called SAND|WICH ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Sandwich I&s;land" UNIT="place"> in honour of the Earl, now Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty: it is larger than the Duke of York's I&s;land, and there &s;eems to be &s;ome good bays and harbours upon the coa&s;t. On the north part of it there is a remarkable peak, like a &s;ugar loaf; and oppo&s;ite to it, upon the coa&s;t of New Ireland, there is ju&s;t &s;uch another: they are di&s;tant about five leagues, in the direction of S. by E. &frac12; E. and N. by W. &frac12; W. All the while we lay to off this i&s;land, we heard an in|ce&s;&s;ant noi&s;e in the night, like the beating of a drum: and being becalmed ju&s;t as we got through the Streight, ten canoes put off from New Ireland, with about one hundred and fifty men on board, and rowed towards the &s;hip; they came near enough to exchange &s;ome trifles with us, which were conveyed at the end of a long &s;tick, but none of them would venture on board. They &s;eemed to prefer &s;uch iron as we gave them to every thing el&s;e, though none of it was manufactured except nails; for, as I ob&s;erved before, we had no cutlery ware on board. The canoes were very long and very narrow, with an outrigger, and &s;ome of them were very neatly made: one of them could not be le&s;s than ninety feet long, for it was very little &s;horter than the &s;hip; it was,
<PB N="599" REF="447">
notwith&s;tanding, formed of a &s;ingle tree; <MILESTONE N="Saturday 12" UNIT="day"> it had &s;ome carved ornaments about it, and was rowed or paddled by three and thirty men: we &s;aw no appearance of &s;ails. The people are black, and woolly-headed, like Negroes, but have not the flat no&s;e and thick lips; and we thought them much the &s;ame people as the inhabitants of Egmont's I&s;land: like them, they were all &s;tark naked, except a few ornaments made of &s;hells upon their arms and legs. They had, how|ever, adopted a practice without which none of our belles and beaus are &s;uppo&s;ed to be completely dre&s;t, for the hair, or rather the wool upon their heads, was very abundantly powdered with white powder: the fa&s;hion of wearing pow|der, therefore, is probably of higher antiquity than it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be, as well as of more exten&s;ive in|fluence; it is indeed carried farther among the&s;e people than among any of the inhabitants of Europe, for they powder not only their heads but their beards too. Their heads how|ever were decorated with more &s;howy ornaments, for I ob|&s;erved that mo&s;t of them had, ju&s;t above one ear, &s;tuck a fea|ther, which appeared to have been taken from the tail of the common dunghil cock; &s;o that the&s;e gentlemen are not without poultry for their table. They were armed with &s;pears, and long &s;ticks or poles, like the quarter-&s;taff; but we did not &s;ee any bows and arrows among them: po&s;&s;ibly they might have them on board, and think proper to keep them out of &s;ight. On my part, I kept every body at their quarters while they were hovering about the &s;hip, and I ob&s;erved that they had a very watchful eye upon our guns, as if they apprehended danger from them; &s;o that po&s;&s;ibly they are not wholly unacquainted with the effect of fire-arms. They had fi&s;hing nets with them, which as well as their cordage, &s;eemed to be very well made. After they had
<PB N="600" REF="448">
been &s;ome time with us,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 12" UNIT="day"> a breeze &s;prung up, and they re|turned to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The peak upon Sandwich I&s;land lies in latitude 2&deg; 53&prime; S., longitude 149&deg; 17&prime; E. After the Indians had left us, we &s;teered nearly we&s;t, and &s;oon after &s;aw a point of land, which proved to be the &s;outh we&s;t extremity of New Ireland, to which I gave the name of CAPE BYRON:<MILESTONE N="Cape Byron" UNIT="place"> it lies in latitude 2&deg; 30&prime; S., longitude 149&deg; 2&prime; E. Over-again&s;t the coa&s;t of New Ireland, to the we&s;tward of Cape Byron, lies a fine large i&s;land, to which I gave the name of NEW HANOVER.<MILESTONE N="New Han|over" UNIT="place"> Between this i&s;land and New Ireland, there is a &s;treight or pa&s;&s;age, which turns away to the N. E. In this pa&s;&s;age lie &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, upon one of which there is a remark|able peak: this i&s;land I called BYRON's ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Byron's I&s;land" UNIT="place"> and the pa&s;&s;age, or &s;treight, I called BYRON's STREIGHT. The land of New Hanover is high; it is finely covered with trees, among which are many plantations, and the whole has a mo&s;t beautiful appearance. The &s;outh we&s;t point of it, which is a high bluff point, I called QUEEN CHARLOTTE's FORELAND, in honour of her Maje&s;ty. This foreland, and the land about it, is remarkable for a great number of little hummocks or hills, but night coming on, with thick wea|ther, hard &s;qualls, and much rain, we could not &s;ee more of it di&s;tinctly enough to de&s;cribe its appearance.</P>
<P>We &s;teered we&s;tward all night,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 13" UNIT="day"> and in the morning, the weather being &s;till thick, our view of New Hanover was very imperfect; but we &s;aw, about eight leagues to the we&s;tward of it, &s;ix or &s;even &s;mall i&s;lands, which I called the DUKE OF PORTLAND's ISLANDS,<MILESTONE N="Duke of Port|lands I&s;lands" UNIT="place"> two of which are pretty large. I now perceived by the &s;well of the &s;ea that we were clear of all the land, and I found Saint George's Channel to
<PB N="601" REF="449">
be a much better and &s;horter pa&s;&s;age,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 13" UNIT="day"> whether from the ea&s;t|ward or the we&s;tward, than round all the land and i&s;lands to the northward; the di&s;tre&s;s therefore which pu&s;hed me upon this di&s;covery, may probably be, in its con&s;equences, of great advantage to future navigators, e&s;pecially as there can be no doubt but that refre&s;hments of every kind may ea&s;ily be procured from the natives who inhabit either of the coa&s;ts of the channel, or the i&s;lands that lie near them, for beads, ribands, looking-gla&s;&s;es, and e&s;pecially iron tools and cut|lery-ware, of which they are immoderately fond, and with which, to our great misfortune, we were not furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Queen Charlotte's Foreland, the &s;outh we&s;t part of New Hanover, lies in latitude 2&deg; 29&prime; S., longitude 148&deg; 27&prime; E.; and the middle of Portland's I&s;lands in latitude 2&deg; 27&prime; S., longi|tude 148&deg; 3&prime; E. The length of this &s;treight or channel, from Cape Saint George to Cape Byron, the &s;outh we&s;t extremity of New Ireland, is above eighty leagues; the di&s;tance from Cape Byron to Queen Charlotte's Foreland is about twelve leagues, and from the Foreland to Portland's I&s;lands about eight leagues; &s;o that the whole length of Saint George's Channel is about one hundred leagues, or three hundred miles.</P>
<P>Though we cleared the Streight in the morning of Sun|day the 13th of September, we had no ob&s;ervation of the &s;un till the 15th, which I could not but greatly regret, as it prevented my being &s;o exact in my latitude and longitude as might be expected. The de&s;cription al&s;o of the country, its productions and people, would have been much more full and circum&s;tantial, if I had not been &s;o much infeebled and di&s;pirited by &s;ickne&s;s, as almo&s;t to &s;ink under the duty that for want of officers devolved upon me, being obliged, when I was &s;carcely able to crawl, to keep watch and watch, and

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age from Saint George's Channel to the I&s;land of Mindanao, with an Account of many I&s;lands that were &s;een, and Incidents that happened by the Way.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as we had cleared Saint George's Channel, we &s;teered we&s;tward, and the next day we di&s;covered land bearing W. N. W. and hauled up for it; it proved to be an i&s;land of con&s;iderable extent, and &s;oon afterwards we &s;aw another to the north ea&s;t of it, but this appeared to be little more than a large rock above water. As I had here &s;trong currents, and for &s;everal days had not been able to get an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un, I cannot &s;o exactly a&s;certain the &s;itu|ation of the&s;e i&s;lands as I might otherwi&s;e have done. As we proceeded to the we&s;tward, we di&s;covered more land, con|&s;i&s;ting of many i&s;lands lying to the &s;outhward of the large one which we had fir&s;t di&s;covered. As the nights were now moonlight, we kept on till eleven o'clock, and the Lieu|tenant, who was then officer of the watch, finding that the cour&s;e we were &s;teering would carry us among them, and not being willing to awaken me till it was my turn to watch, hauled off S. by E. and S. S. E. I came upon deck about midnight,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> and at one in the morning, perceiving that we were clear of them, I bore away again to the we&s;tward with an ea&s;y &s;ail: the i&s;lands, however, were not far di&s;tant, and about &s;ix o'clock, a con&s;iderable number of canoes, with &s;everal hundred people on board, came off, and paddled
<PB N="603" REF="451">
toward the &s;hip: one of them, with &s;even men on board,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> came near enough to hail us, and made us &s;everal &s;igns which we could not perfectly under&s;tand, but repeated, as near as we could, to &s;hew that whatever they meant to us we meant to them; however, the better to be&s;peak their good-will, and invite them on board, we held up to them &s;everal of the few trifles we had: upon this they drew nearer to the &s;hip, and I flattered my&s;elf that they were coming on board; but on the contrary, as &s;oon as they came within reach of us they threw their lances, with great force, where we &s;tood thicke&s;t upon the deck. As I thought it better to prevent than to repre&s;s a general attack, in which, as the number would be more, the mi&s;chief would be greater, and having now no doubt of their ho&s;tile intentions, I fired &s;ome mu&s;kets, and one of the &s;wivel guns, upon which, &s;ome of them being killed or wounded, they rowed off and joined the other canoes, of which there were twelve or four|teen, with &s;everal hundred men on board. I then brought to, waiting for the i&s;&s;ue, and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee, that, after having long con&s;ulted together, they made for the &s;hore: that I might &s;till farther intimidate them, and more effectually prevent their return, I fired a round &s;hot from one of my &s;ix-pounders, &s;o as to fall into the water beyond them: this &s;eemed to have a good effect, for they not only u&s;ed their paddles more nimbly, but hoi&s;ted &s;ail, &s;till &s;tanding towards the &s;hore. Soon after, however, &s;everal more canoes put off from another part of the i&s;land, and came towards us very fa&s;t: they &s;topped at about the &s;ame di&s;tance as the other had done, and one of them al&s;o in the &s;ame manner came forward: to the people on board this ve&s;&s;el we made all the &s;igns of friend&s;hip we could devi&s;e, &s;hewing them every thing we had which we thought would plea&s;e them, opening our arms, and inviting them on board: but
<PB N="604" REF="452">
our rhetoric was to no effect,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> for as &s;oon as they came within a ca&s;t of the &s;hip, they poured in a &s;hower of darts and lances, which, however, did us no harm. We returned the a&s;&s;ault by firing &s;ome mu&s;kets, and one man being killed, the re&s;t precipitately leaped into the &s;ea, and &s;wimming to the others, who waited at a di&s;tance, all returned together from whence they came. As &s;oon as the canoe was de&s;erted, we got out our boat and brought it on board: it was full fifty feet long, though one of the &s;malle&s;t that came again&s;t us; it was very rudely made out of one tree, but had an outrigger. We found in it &s;ix fine fi&s;h, and a turtle, &s;ome yams, one cocoa-nut, and a bag full of a &s;mall kind of apple or plum, of a &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te and farinaceous &s;ub|&s;tance; it had a flatti&s;h kernel, and was wholly different from every thing we have &s;een either before or &s;ince: it was eatable raw, but much better boiled, or roa&s;ted in the em|bers: we found al&s;o two large earthen pots, &s;haped &s;ome|what like a jug, with a wide mouth, but without handles, and a con&s;iderable quantity of matting, which the&s;e people u&s;e both for &s;ails and awning, &s;preading it over bent &s;ticks, much in the &s;ame manner as the tilts of the London wher|ries. From the contents of this ve&s;&s;el we judged that it had been fi&s;hing, and we ob&s;erved that the people had a fire on board, with one of their pots on it, in which they were boiling their provi&s;ion. When we had &s;atisfied our curio&s;ity by examining it, we cut it up for fire-wood.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians were the &s;ame kind of people that we had &s;een before on the coa&s;t of New Ireland, and at Egmont I&s;land: they were of a very dark copper colour, nearly black, with woolly heads. They chew beetle-nut, and go quite naked, except the rude ornaments of &s;hells &s;trung together, which they wear round their legs and arms: they were al&s;o pow|dered

<P>Having di&s;engaged our&s;elves from this fierce and un|friendly people, we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e along the other i&s;lands, which are between twenty and thirty in number, and of con&s;iderable extent; one in particular would alone make a large kingdom. I called them the ADMIRALTY ISLANDS,<MILESTONE N="Admiralty I&s;lands" UNIT="place"> and &s;hould have been glad to have examined them, if my &s;hip had been in a better condition, and I had been provided with &s;uch articles as are proper for an Indian trade, e&s;pecially as their appearance is very inviting: they are clothed with the mo&s;t beautiful verdure; the woods are lofty and luxuriant, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;pots that have been cleared for plantations, groves of cocoa-nut trees, and hou&s;es of the natives, who &s;eem to be very numerous. No|thing would be more ea&s;y than to e&s;tabli&s;h an amicable in|tercour&s;e with them, as they would &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible that our &s;uperiority would render conte&s;t vain, and traffic advan|tageous. I judge the middle of the large&s;t to lie in latitude 2&deg; 18&prime; S., longitude 146&deg; 44&prime; E. and at the di&s;tance of five and thirty leagues from Queen Charlotte's Foreland in New Ha|nover, in the direction of W. &frac12; N. On the &s;outh &s;ide of this i&s;land, there is a &s;mall one, which ri&s;es conically in a high peak. The latitude of this peak is 2&deg; 27&prime; S. and it lies five degrees and an half we&s;tward of Cape Saint George in New Ireland. As we ran along the &s;outh &s;ide of the large i&s;land, we found it to be eighteen leagues long, in the direction of ea&s;t and we&s;t; how far it runs to the northward, I do not know, but by its appearance there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance. I think it probable, in the highe&s;t degree, that the&s;e i&s;lands produce many valuable

<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e i&s;lands, we continued our cour&s;e W. by N. with a fine ea&s;tern breeze, and &s;mooth water.

As it was dark we could &s;ee no more of it, and having a fine breeze, which we could not afford to lo&s;e, we kept on. Its latitude is about 1&deg; 45&prime; S., and its longitude about 143&deg; 2&prime; E.: the variation here was 4&deg; 40&prime; E. and we found a &s;trong north we&s;terly current.

They run about N. W. by W. S. E. by E. One is about three miles long, and the other about &s;ix: the pa&s;|&s;age between them appeared to be about two miles broad.

<P>On the 25th, we &s;aw land ahead,<MILESTONE N="Friday 25" UNIT="day"> which proved to be three &s;mall i&s;lands; and before it was dark, we got pretty near them. Several canoes &s;oon came off, filled with the natives, who, after making &s;igns of peace, came on board without the lea&s;t appearance of fear or di&s;tru&s;t: they had nothing with them but a few cocoa-nuts, which they &s;old with great joy for a few pieces of an iron hoop; we &s;oon found that they were not unacquainted with that metal, which they called <HI>Parram,</HI> and they made us under&s;tand, by &s;igns, that a &s;hip like ours &s;ometimes touched at their i&s;lands for re|fre&s;hment. I gave one of them three pieces of an old iron hoop, each about four inches long, which threw him into an exta&s;y little &s;hort of di&s;traction: I could not but &s;ympa|thize in his joy, nor ob&s;erve, without great plea&s;ure, the changes of countenance, and extravagance of ge&s;ture, by which it was expre&s;&s;ed. All the&s;e people indeed appeared to be more fond of iron than any we had &s;een before, and I am &s;ure, that for iron tools, we might have purcha&s;ed every thing upon the i&s;lands which we could have brought away.

Their features are plea&s;ing, and their teeth re|markably white and even: they were of the common &s;tature, but nimble, vigorous, and active in a &s;urpri&s;ing degree, run|ning up to the ma&s;t-head much fa&s;ter than our own people. Their di&s;po&s;ition was free and open, they eat and drank whatever was given them, went without he&s;itation into every part of the &s;hip, and were as familiar and merry with the crew as if they had been of long and intimate acquaint|ance. They were not, like the people on all the other i&s;lands that we had vi&s;ited, quite naked, though they had only a &s;light covering for the wai&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ted of a nar|row piece of fine matting. Their canoes were very well and neatly made, having a hollow tree for the bottom, and planks for the &s;ides, with a &s;ail of fine matting, and an out|rigger: their ropes and netting were al&s;o very good. They urged us &s;trongly to go on &s;hore, offering to leave an equal number of their own people behind, as a pledge of their &s;afe return; and indeed I would gladly have con&s;ented if it had been in my power, but a &s;trong we&s;terly current hurried me to &s;o great a di&s;tance, that I had no opportunity to &s;eek for anchorage, and night coming on, we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e.

As I thought it po&s;&s;ible that this man might be the means of our making &s;ome u&s;eful di&s;covery, I did not put him a&s;hore by force, but indulged him in his de&s;ire: we learnt from him that there were other i&s;lands to the north|ward, the inhabitants of which he &s;aid had iron, and always

fellow, whom I called Jo&s;eph Freewill, from his readine&s;s to
go with us, become gradually &s;ickly after he had been &s;ome
time at &s;ea: he lived till I got to the i&s;land of Celebes, and
there died. As the i&s;lands from which I had taken him were
very &s;mall and low, the large&s;t being not more than five
miles in compa&s;s, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee with how many of
the productions of Celebes he was acquainted; be&s;ide the
cocoa-nut and palm, he knew the beetle-nut and the lime,
and the moment he got a bread-fruit, he went to the fire
and roa&s;ted it in the embers. He made us under&s;tand al&s;o,
that in his country they had plenty of fi&s;h, and turtle in
their &s;ea&s;on. It is however very probable, notwith&s;tanding
the number of people who &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e i&s;lands, that
they have no fre&s;h water but what falls in rain: how they
catch and pre&s;erve it, I had no opportunity to learn, but I
never met with a &s;pring in a &s;pot &s;o &s;mall and low, and in
&s;uch a &s;pot I believe no &s;pring was ever found. The large&s;t

north of the line, and in 137&deg; 51&prime; ea&s;t longitude. They are
all &s;urrounded by a reef of rocks. The chart of the&s;e i&s;lands

with chalk upon the deck, and a&s;certained the depth of
water by &s;tretching his arms as a fathom.</P>

<P>On the 28th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 28" UNIT="day"> being in latitude 2&deg; 53&prime; N., longitude 136&deg; 10&prime; E. we fell in with a very dangerous &s;hoal, which is about eleven or twelve miles in circuit, and &s;urrounded with &s;mall &s;tones that ju&s;t &s;hew them&s;elves above water. We found here a &s;trong northerly current, but could not deter|mine whether it inclined to the ea&s;t or we&s;t.</P>
<P>In the evening, we di&s;covered from the ma&s;t-head another i&s;land to the &s;outhward of us: the ea&s;t end of it &s;eemed to ri&s;e in a peak, and had the appearance of a &s;ail, but we did not go near enough to &s;ee any thing of it from the deck. I &s;uppo&s;e its latitude to be about 2&deg; 50&prime; N., and its longitude, ea&s;t of London, about 136&deg; 10&prime; E.</P>
<P>We continued to have a current to the northward, till Monday the 5th of October,<MILESTONE N="October" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 5" UNIT="day"> when, being in latitude 4&deg; 30&prime; N.

I had, among other deficiencies and misfortunes, no &s;mall boat on board, &s;o that I could not try the&s;e currents, which I had a great de&s;ire to do; but I am of opinion, that when the current &s;et &s;outh|ward it inclined to the ea&s;t, and that when it &s;et northward it inclined to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>On Monday the 12th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 12" UNIT="day"> we di&s;covered a &s;mall i&s;land with trees upon it, though &s;carcely bigger than a rock, and I called it CURRENT ISLAND.<MILESTONE N="Current I&s;land" UNIT="place"> It lies in latitude 4&deg; 40&prime; N., longitude 14&deg; 24&prime; W. of Queen Charlotte's Fore-land.

<P>ON the 26th, we di&s;covered land again,<MILESTONE N="Monday 26" UNIT="day"> but not being able to make an ob&s;ervation, we could a&s;certain our latitude and longitude only by our dead reckoning; the next day,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 2" UNIT="day"> how|ever, was more favourable, and I then found the effect of the current had been &s;o great, that I was obliged to add to the log S. W. by S. no le&s;s than 64 miles for the la&s;t two days. We now knew that the land we had &s;een was the north ea&s;t part of the i&s;land of Mindanao: as I had many &s;ick people on board, and was in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing need of re|fre&s;hments,
<PB N="612" REF="462">
I determined to try what could be procured in a bay which Dampier has de&s;cribed as lying on the &s;outh ea&s;t part of the i&s;land,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 27" UNIT="day"> and which, he &s;ays, furni&s;hed him with great plenty of deer from a &s;avannah. I therefore coa&s;ted that &s;ide of the i&s;land, and that I might be &s;ure not to mi&s;s the bay, I &s;ent out the Lieutenant with the boat and a proper number of hands, to keep in &s;hore ahead of the &s;hip. No &s;uch bay however was to be found, but at the very &s;outhermo&s;t extremity of the i&s;land they opened a little nook at the bottom of which was a town, and a fort. As &s;oon as our boat was di&s;covered by the people on &s;hore, they fired a great gun, and &s;ent off three boats or canoes full of people. As the Lieutenant had not a &s;ufficient force to oppo&s;e them, he immediately made towards the &s;hip, and the canoes chaced him till they came within &s;ight of her, and being then over-matched in their turn, they thought fit to go back. Being thus di&s;appointed in my &s;earch of Dampier's Bay and Savannah, I would have anchored off this town, not|with&s;tanding the&s;e ho&s;tile appearances, if it had not been nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to get up &s;ome guns from the hold, and make a few nece&s;&s;ary repairs in the rigging; this however being the ca&s;e,<MILESTONE N="November" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 2" UNIT="day"> I ran a little to the ea&s;tward, where, on the 2d of November, I came to an anchor in a little bay, having a bottom of &s;oft mud, and &s;even fathom of water, at the di&s;|tance of a cable's length from the &s;hore; the we&s;termo&s;t point of the bay bore W. S. W. di&s;tant about three miles; the ea&s;termo&s;t point E. by S. di&s;tant about one mile; a river, which empties it&s;elf into the bay, about N. W. and the peak of an i&s;land, called Hummock I&s;land, S. 7&deg; E. di&s;tant about five leagues. Before it was dark the &s;ame day, our two boats went to the river, and brought off their loads of water: they &s;aw no &s;igns of inhabitants where they were on &s;hore, but we ob&s;erved a canoe come round the we&s;termo&s;t point of the
<PB N="613" REF="463">
bay, which we &s;uppo&s;ed had been di&s;patched from the town,<MILESTONE N="Monday 2" UNIT="day"> to learn what we were, or at lea&s;t to &s;ee what we were doing. As &s;oon as I di&s;covered this canoe, I hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h colours, and was not without hope that &s;he would come on board, but after viewing us &s;ome time, &s;he returned. As we had &s;een no inhabitants, nor any &s;igns of inhabitants, where we got our water, I intended to procure a further &s;upply the next day from the &s;ame place, and endeavour al&s;o to re|cruit our wood; but about nine o'clock at night, we were &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed by a loud noi&s;e on that part of the &s;hore which was abrea&s;t of the &s;hip: it was made by a great number of human voices, and very much re&s;embled the war-whoop of the American Savages, a hideous &s;hout which they give at the moment of their attack, and in which all who have heard it agree there is &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ibly terrifying and horrid.</P>
<P>As I was now farther convinced that it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;po&s;e of our little force to the greate&s;t advantage, we began the next day by getting the guns up from the hold,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> and making the nece&s;&s;ary repairs to our rigging. At eleven o'clock, not having &s;een any thing of the people, who had endeavoured to terrify us by their yells in the night, I &s;ent the longboat on &s;hore for more water; but, as I thought it probable that they might have concealed them&s;elves in the woods, I kept the cutter manned and armed, with the Lieutenant on board, that immediate &s;uccour might be &s;ent to the waterers, if any danger &s;hould threaten them. It &s;oon appeared that my conjectures were well founded, for our people had no &s;ooner left their boat, than a number of armed men ru&s;hed out of the woods, one of whom held up &s;omewhat white, which I took to be a &s;ignal of peace. Upon this occa&s;ion I was again &s;en&s;ible of the mortifying defi|ciency in the &s;hip's equipment, which I had &s;o often experi|enced
<PB N="614" REF="464">
before.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> I had no white flag on board, and therefore, as the be&s;t expedient in my power, I ordered the Lieutenant, whom I &s;ent on &s;hore in the cutter, to di&s;play one of my table-cloths: as &s;oon as the officer landed, the &s;tandard-bearer and another came down to him unarmed, and re|ceived him with great appearance of friend&s;hip. One of them addre&s;&s;ed him in Dutch, which none of our people under&s;tood; he then &s;poke a few words in Spani&s;h, in which one of the per&s;ons of the cutter was a con&s;iderable pro|ficient: the Indian however &s;poke it &s;o very imperfectly, that it was with great difficulty, and by the help of many &s;igns, he made him&s;elf under&s;tood; po&s;&s;ibly if any of our people had &s;poken Dutch, he might have been found equally deficient in that language. He a&s;ked for the Captain how|ever by the name of the &s;kipper, and enquired whether we were Hollanders; whether our &s;hip was intended for mer|chandize or for war; how many guns and men &s;he carried; and whether &s;he had been, or was going to Batavia. When we had &s;atisfied him in all the&s;e particulars, he &s;aid that we &s;hould go to the town, and that he would introduce us to the Governor, whom he di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of Raja. The Lieutenant then told him, that we intended to go to the town, but that we were in immediate want of water, and therefore de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to fill &s;ome ca&s;ks; he al&s;o reque&s;ted that the people who were armed with bows and arrows might be ordered to a greater di&s;tance. With both the&s;e requi&s;itions the Indian, who &s;eemed to be inve&s;ted with con&s;iderable authority, complied; and as he &s;eemed to take particular notice of a &s;ilk handkerchief which the Lieutenant had tied round his neck, it was im|mediately pre&s;ented to him; in return for which he de&s;ired him to accept a kind of cravat, made of coar&s;e callico, which was tied round his own, his dre&s;s being &s;omewhat
<PB N="615" REF="465">
after the Dutch fa&s;hion. After this interchange of cravats,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> he enquired of the officer whether the &s;hip was furni&s;hed with any articles for trade; to which he an&s;wered that &s;he was &s;ufficiently furni&s;hed to trade for provi&s;ions, but nothing more: the Chief replied, that whatever we wanted we &s;hould have. After this conference, which I con&s;idered as an ear|ne&s;t of every advantage which this place could afford us, the boats returned on board laden with water, and we went cheerfully on with our bu&s;ine&s;s on board the &s;hip. In about two hours, however, we &s;aw, with equal &s;urpri&s;e and con|cern, many hundreds of armed men, po&s;ting them&s;elves in parties at different places among the trees, upon the beach, abrea&s;t of the &s;hip; their weapons were mu&s;quets, bows and arrows, long pikes or &s;pears, broad &s;words, a kind of hanger called a cre&s;s, and targets: we ob&s;erved al&s;o, that they hauled a canoe, which lay under a &s;hed upon the beach, up into the woods. The&s;e were not friendly appear|ances, and they were &s;ucceeded by others that were &s;till more ho&s;tile; for the&s;e people &s;pent all the remainder of the day in entering and ru&s;hing out of the woods, as if they had been making &s;allies to attack an enemy; &s;ometimes &s;hooting their arrows, and throwing their lances into the water towards the &s;hip; and &s;ometimes lifting their targets, and brandi&s;hing their &s;words at us in a menacing manner. In the mean time we were not idle on board: we got up our guns, repaired our rigging, and put every thing in order before evening, and then, being ready to &s;ail, I determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to get another conference with the people on &s;hore, and learn the rea&s;on of &s;o &s;udden and unaccount|able a change of behaviour. The Lieutenant therefore was again di&s;patched, and as a te&s;timony that our di&s;po&s;ition was &s;till peaceable, the table-cloth was again di&s;played as a flag of truce. I had the precaution, however, to order the boat
<PB N="616" REF="466">
to a part of the beach which was clear of wood,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> that the people on board might not be liable to mi&s;chief from ene|mies whom they could not &s;ee; I al&s;o ordered that nobody &s;hould go on &s;hore. When the Indians &s;aw the boat come to the beach, and ob&s;erved that nobody landed, one of them came out of the wood with a bow and arrows in his hand, and made &s;igns for the boat to come to the place where he &s;tood. This the officer very prudently declined, as he would then have been within bow-&s;hot of an ambu&s;cade, and after waiting &s;ome time, and finding that a conference could be procured upon no other terms, he returned back to the &s;hip. It was certainly in my power to have de&s;troyed many of the&s;e unfriendly people, by firing my great guns into the wood, but it would have an&s;wered no good purpo&s;e: we could not afterwards have procured wood and water here without ri&s;king the lo&s;s of our own people, and I &s;till hoped that refre&s;hment might be procured upon friendly terms at the town, which, now I was in a condition to defend my&s;elf again&s;t a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault, I re&s;olved to vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The next morning therefore,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 4" UNIT="day"> as &s;oon as it was light, I &s;ailed from this place, which I called DECEITFUL BAY, with a light land breeze, and betweeen ten and eleven o'clock we got off the bay or nook, at the bottom of which our boats had di&s;covered the town and fort. It happened however that ju&s;t at this time the weather became thick, with heavy rain, and it began to blow hard from a quarter which made the land here a lee &s;hore; this obliged me to &s;tand off, and having no time to lo&s;e, I &s;tood away to the we&s;tward that I might reach Batavia before the &s;ea&s;on was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now give a more particular account of our navi|gating the &s;ea that wa&s;hes the coa&s;ts of this i&s;land, the rather as Dampier's de&s;cription is in &s;everal particulars erroneous.</P>
<P><PB N="617" REF="467">Having &s;een the north ea&s;t part of the i&s;land on the twenty-&s;ixth of October, without certainly knowing whe|ther it was Mindanao or Saint John's, we got nearer to it the next day, and made what we knew to be Saint Augu&s;tina, the &s;outh ea&s;termo&s;t part of the i&s;land, which ri&s;es in little hummocks, that run down to a low point at the water's edge; it bears N. 40 E. at the di&s;tance of two and twenty leagues from a little i&s;land, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other i&s;lands that lie off the &s;outhermo&s;t point of Mindanao by a hill or hummock, and which for that rea&s;on I called HUM|MOCK ISLAND. All this land is very high, one ridge of mountains ri&s;ing behind another, &s;o that at a great di&s;tance it appears not like one i&s;land but &s;everal. After our fir&s;t di&s;covery of the i&s;land, we kept turning along the ea&s;t &s;ide from the northward to Cape Saint Augu&s;tina, nearly S. by W. &frac12; W. and N. by E. &frac12; E. for about twenty leagues. The wind was to the &s;outhward along the &s;hore, and as we ap|proached the land, we &s;tood in for an opening which had the appearance of a good bay, where we intended to an|chor; but we found that it was too deep for our purpo&s;e, and that &s;ome &s;hoals rendered the entrance of it dangerous. To this bay, which lies about eight or ten leagues N. by E. from Cape Saint Augu&s;tina, the &s;outh ea&s;t extremity of the i&s;land, I gave the name of DISAPPOINTMENT BAY. When we were in the offing &s;tanding in for this Bay, we ob&s;erved a large hummock, which had the appearance of an i&s;land, but which I believe to be a penin&s;ula, joined by a low i&s;thmus to the main; this hummock formed the northermo&s;t part of the entrance, and another high bluff point oppo&s;ite to it formed the &s;outhermo&s;t part; be|tween the&s;e two points are the &s;hoals that have been men|tioned; and &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, only one of which can be &s;een till they are approached very near. On this part of the

coa&s;t we &s;aw no &s;igns of inhabitants; the land is of a &s;tu|pendous height, with mountains piled upon mountains till the &s;ummits are hidden in the clouds: in the offing there|fore it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;timate its di&s;tance, for what appear then to be &s;mall hillocks, ju&s;t emerging from the water, in compari&s;on of the mountains that are &s;een over them, &s;well into high hills as they are approached, and the di&s;tance is found to be thrice as much as it was imagined; perhaps this will account for the land here being &s;o ill laid down, and in &s;ituations &s;o very different as it appears to be in all our Engli&s;h charts. We found here a &s;trong current &s;etting to the &s;outhward along the &s;hore, as the land trended. The high land that is to the north of Saint Augu&s;tina, be|comes gradually lower towards the Cape, a low flat point in which it terminates, and off which, at a very little di&s;tance, lie two large rocks. Its latitude is 6&deg; 15&prime; N. and the longi|tude by account 127&deg; 20&prime; E.</P>
<P>From this Cape the land trends away W. and W. by S. for &s;ix or &s;even leagues, and then turns up to the N. W. making a very deep bay, the bottom of which, as we cro&s;&s;ed it from Saint Augu&s;tina to the high land on the other &s;ide, which is not le&s;s than twelve leagues, we could not &s;ee. The coa&s;t on the farther &s;ide of it, coming up from the bottom, trend fir&s;t to the S. and S. S. W. and then to the S. W. by W. to|wards the &s;outh extremity of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Off this &s;outhern extremity, which Dampier calls the &s;outh ea&s;t by mi&s;take, the &s;outh ea&s;t being Saint Augu&s;tina, at the di&s;tance of five, &s;ix, and &s;even leagues, lie ten or twelve i&s;lands, though Dampier &s;ays there are only two, and that together they are about five leagues round. The i&s;lands that I &s;aw could not be contained in a circuit of le&s;s than fifteen leagues, and from the number of boats that I &s;aw
<PB N="619" REF="469">
among them I imagine they are well inhabited. The large&s;t of the&s;e lies to the S. W. of the others, and makes in a re|markable peak, &s;o that it is fir&s;t &s;een in coming in with the land, and is indeed vi&s;ible at a very great di&s;tance. Its lati|tude I make 5&deg; 24&prime; N. and its longitude by account 126&deg; 37&prime; E. This i&s;land, which I called HUMMOCK ISLAND,<MILESTONE N="Hummock I&s;land" UNIT="place"> bears from Saint Augu&s;tina S. 40 W. at the di&s;tance of between twenty and two and twenty leagues; and from the &s;ame Cape, the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the i&s;land Mindanao bears S. W. &frac34; W. at the di&s;tance of between twenty-one and twenty-three leagues. This &s;outhermo&s;t extremity con&s;i&s;ts of three or four points, which bear ea&s;t and we&s;t of each other for about &s;even miles. They lie in latitude 5&deg; 34&prime; N., longitude 126&deg; 25&prime; E. according to my account. The variation here was one point ea&s;t.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e I&s;lands and the main, and found the pa&s;&s;age good, the current &s;etting to the we&s;tward. Dam|pier has placed his Bay and Savannah four leagues N. W. from the ea&s;termo&s;t i&s;land, and there I &s;ought it, as indeed I did on all the S. E. part of the i&s;land till we came to the little creek which ran up to the town.</P>
<P>All the &s;outhern part of Mindanao is extremely plea&s;ant, with many &s;pots where the woods had been cleared for plantations, and fine lawns of a beautiful verdure: this part al&s;o is well inhabited, as well as the neighbouring i&s;lands. Of the town I can give no account, as the weather was &s;o thick that I could not &s;ee it; neither could I &s;ufficiently di&s;|tingui&s;h the land to &s;et off the points, at which I was not a little mortified.</P>
<P>When I came to open the land to the we&s;tward of the &s;outhermo&s;t point, I found it trend from that point W. N. W. and N. W. by W. forming fir&s;t a point at the di&s;tance of
<PB N="620" REF="470">
about &s;even or eight leagues, and then a very deep bay run|ning &s;o far in to the N. and N. E. that I could not &s;ee the bot|tom of it. The we&s;termo&s;t point of this bay is low, but the land &s;oon ri&s;es again, and runs along to the N. W. by W. which &s;eems to be the direction of this coa&s;t, from the &s;outhermo&s;t point of the i&s;land towards the city of Min|danao.</P>
<P>To the we&s;tward of this deep bay, the land is all flat, and in compari&s;on of the other parts of the i&s;land, but thinly wooded. Over this flat appears a peak of &s;tupendous height, which ri&s;es into the clouds like a tower. Between the en|trance of this bay and the &s;outh point of the i&s;land there is another very high hill, the top of which has the funnel &s;hape of a volcano, but I did not perceive that it emitted either fire or &s;moke. It is po&s;&s;ible that this deep bay is that which Dampier mentions, and that it is mi&s;placed by an error of the pre&s;s; for, if in&s;tead of &s;aying it bore N. W. <HI>four</HI> leagues from the <HI>ea&s;termo&s;t</HI> of the i&s;lands, he had &s;aid it bore N. W. <HI>fourteen</HI> leagues from the <HI>we&s;termo&s;t</HI> of the i&s;lands, it would corre&s;pond well with his de&s;cription, the bearings being the &s;ame, and the land on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it high, and low on the we&s;t: he is al&s;o nearly right in the latitude of his i&s;lands, which he makes 5&deg; 10&prime; N.; for probably &s;ome parts of the &s;outhermo&s;t of them may lie in that latitude; but as I did not go to the &s;outhward of them, this is only conjecture.</P>
<P>Between Hummock I&s;land, which is the large&s;t and we&s;termo&s;t of them, and the i&s;lands to the ea&s;tward of it, which are all flat and even, is a pa&s;&s;age running north and &s;outh, which appears to be clear. The north ea&s;termo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands is &s;mall, low, and flat, with a white &s;andy beach all round it, and a great many trees in the middle.
<PB N="621" REF="471">
Ea&s;t, or north ea&s;t of this i&s;land, there are &s;hoals and break|ers; and I &s;aw no other appearance of danger in the&s;e parts. Neither did I &s;ee any of the i&s;lands which are mentioned by Dampier, and laid down in all the charts, near Mindanao in the offing: perhaps they are at a more remote di&s;tance than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed; for without great attention naviga|tors will be much deceived in this particular by the height of the land, as I have ob&s;erved already. As I coa&s;ted this i&s;land, I found the current &s;et very &s;trong to the &s;outhward along the &s;hore, till I came to the &s;outh end of it, where I found it run N. W. and N. W. by W. which is nearly as the land trends. We had the winds commonly from S. W. to N. W. with light airs, frequent rain, and un&s;ettled wea|ther.</P>
<P>We now bid farewel to Mindanao greatly di&s;appointed in our hope of obtaining refre&s;hments, which at fir&s;t the in|habitants &s;o readily promi&s;ed to furni&s;h. We &s;u&s;pected that there were Dutchmen, or at lea&s;t Dutch parti&s;ans in the town; and that, having di&s;covered us to be Engli&s;h, they had di&s;patched an armed party to prevent our having any intercour&s;e with the natives, who arrived about two hours after our friendly conference, and were the people that de|fied us from the &s;hore.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age from Mindanao to the I&s;land of Celebes, with a particular Account of the Streight of Maca&s;&s;ar, in which many Errors are corrected.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER leaving Mindanao,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 14" UNIT="day"> I &s;tood to the we&s;tward for the pa&s;&s;age between the i&s;lands of Borneo and Cele|bes, called the Streight of Maca&s;&s;ar, and made it on Satur|day the fourteenth. I ob&s;erved, that during the whole of this run we had a &s;trong north we&s;terly current; but that while we were nearer to Mindanao than Celebes, it ran ra|ther towards the north than the we&s;t; and that when we came nearer to Celebes than we were to Mindanao, it ran rather towards the we&s;t than the north. The land of Cele|bes on the north end runs along to the entrance of the pa&s;&s;age, is very lofty, and &s;eems to trend away about W. by S. to a remarkable point in the pa&s;&s;age, which makes in a hummock, and which at fir&s;t we took for an i&s;land. I believe it to be the &s;ame which in the French charts is called Stroomen Point, but I gave it the name of HUMMOCK POINT. Its latitude according to my account is 1&deg; 20&prime; N., longitude 121&deg; 39&prime; E.; and it is a good mark for tho&s;e to know the pa&s;&s;age that fall in with the land coming from the ea&s;tward, who, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould always make this &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age. From Hummock Point the land trends more away to the &s;outhward, about S. W. by W. and to the &s;outhward of it there is a deep bay, full of i&s;lands and rocks, which ap|peared to me to be very dangerous. Ju&s;t off the Point
<PB N="623" REF="473">
there are two rocks, which, though they are above water,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 14" UNIT="day"> cannot be &s;een from a &s;hip till &s;he is clo&s;e to the land. To the ea&s;tward of this Point, clo&s;e to the &s;hore, are two i&s;lands, one of them very flat, long, and even, and the other &s;welling into a hill: both the&s;e i&s;lands, as well as the adjacent coun|try, are well covered with trees: I &s;tood clo&s;e in a little to the ea&s;tward of them, and had no ground with an hundred fa|thom, within half a mile of the &s;hore, which &s;eemed to be rocky. A little to the we&s;tward of the&s;e i&s;lands, we &s;aw no le&s;s than &s;ixty boats, which were fi&s;hing on &s;ome &s;hoals that lie between them and Hummock Point. This part of the &s;hore appeared to be foul, and I think &s;hould not be ap|proached without great caution. In this place I found the currents various and uncertain, &s;ometimes &s;etting to the &s;outhward, and &s;ometimes to the northward, and &s;ometimes there was no current at all; the weather al&s;o was very un|&s;ettled, and &s;o was the wind; it blew, however, chiefly to the &s;outh and &s;outh we&s;t quarter, but we had &s;ometimes &s;udden and violent gu&s;ts, and tornadoes from the N. W. with thunder, lightning, and rain: the&s;e generally la&s;ted about an hour, when they were &s;ucceeded by a dead calm, and the wind would afterwards &s;pring up fre&s;h from the S. W. or S. S. W. which was right again&s;t us, and blow &s;trong. From the&s;e appearances I conjectured that the &s;hifting &s;ea&s;on had commenced, and that the we&s;t mon&s;oon would &s;oon &s;et in. The &s;hip &s;ailed &s;o ill that we made very little way; we frequently founded in this pa&s;&s;age, but could get no ground.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of November,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 21" UNIT="day"> as we were &s;tanding towards Borneo, we made two &s;mall i&s;lands, which I judged to be the &s;ame that in the French chart are called Taba I&s;lands: they are very &s;mall, and covered with trees. By my ac|count, they lie in latitude 1&deg; 44&prime; N., longitude 7&deg; 32&prime; W. of the &s;outh end of Mindanao, and are di&s;tant from Hummock,
<PB N="624" REF="474">
or Stroomen Point,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 21" UNIT="day"> about fifty-eight leagues. The weather was now hazy, but happening &s;uddenly to clear up, we &s;aw a &s;hoal, with breakers, at the di&s;tance of about five or &s;ix miles, from the &s;outh to the north we&s;t. Off the north end of this &s;hoal we &s;aw four hummocks clo&s;e together, which we took for &s;mall i&s;lands, and &s;even more from the S. &frac12; W. to the W. &frac12; S.: whether the&s;e are really i&s;lands, or &s;ome hills on the i&s;land of Borneo, I could not determine. This &s;hoal is certainly very dangerous, but may be avoided by going to the we&s;tward of Taba I&s;lands, where the pa&s;&s;age is clear and broad. In the French chart of Mon&s;ieur D'Apres de Mande|villette, publi&s;hed in 1745, two &s;hoals are laid down, to the ea&s;tward, and a little to the north of the&s;e i&s;lands: one of them is called <HI>Vanloorif,</HI> and the other, on which are placed two i&s;lands, <HI>Harigs</HI>; but the&s;e &s;hoals and i&s;lands have cer|tainly no exi&s;tence, as I turned through this part of the pa&s;|&s;age from &s;ide to &s;ide, and &s;ailed over the very &s;pot where they are &s;uppo&s;ed to lie. In the &s;ame chart &s;even &s;mall i&s;lands are al&s;o laid down within half a degree to the north|ward of the line, and exactly in the middle of the narrowe&s;t part of this pa&s;&s;age; but neither have the&s;e i&s;lands any exi&s;t|ence, except upon paper, though I believe there may be &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands clo&s;e to the main land of Borneo: we thought we had &s;een two, which we took to be tho&s;e that are laid down in the charts off Porto Tubo, but of this I am not certain. The &s;outhermo&s;t and narrowe&s;t part of this pa&s;&s;age is about eighteen or twenty leagues broad, with high lands on each &s;ide. We continued labouring in it till the 27th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 27" UNIT="day"> before we cro&s;&s;ed the line, &s;o that we were a fort|night in &s;ailing eight and twenty leagues, the di&s;tance from the north entrance of the &s;treight, which we made on the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th. After we got to the &s;outhward of the line, we found a &s;light current &s;etting again&s;t us to the northward, which
<PB N="625" REF="475">
daily increa&s;ed: the weather was &s;till un&s;ettled,<MILESTONE N="Friday 27" UNIT="day"> with much wet: the winds were chiefly S. W. and W. S. W. and very &s;el|dom farther to the northward than W. N. W. except in the tornadoes, which grew more frequent and violent; and by them we got nothing but hard labour, as they obliged us to hand all our &s;ails, which indeed with our utmo&s;t effort we were &s;carcely able to do, our debility daily increa&s;ing by the falling &s;ick of the few that were well, or the death of &s;ome among the many that were &s;ick. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances we u&s;ed our utmo&s;t endeavours to get hold of the land on the Borneo &s;ide, but were not able, and continued to &s;truggle with our misfortunes till the 3d of December,<MILESTONE N="December" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 3" UNIT="day"> when we fell in with the &s;mall i&s;lands and &s;hoals called the Little Pater|no&s;ters, the &s;outhermo&s;t of which, according to my account, lies in latitude 2&deg; 31&prime; S. and the northermo&s;t in 2&deg; 15&prime; S. the longitude of the northermo&s;t I made 117&deg; 12&prime; E.: they bear about S. E. &frac14; S. and N. W. &frac14; N. of each other, di&s;tant eight leagues, and between them are the others; the number of the whole is eight. They lie very near the Celebes &s;ide of the &s;treight, and being unable either to weather them, or get to the we&s;tward of them, we were obliged to go between them and the i&s;land. We had here tempe&s;tuous weather and contrary winds, with &s;udden and impetuous gu&s;ts, which, as we had not a number of hands &s;ufficient to bend the &s;ails, often endangered our ma&s;ts and yards, and did great da|mage to our &s;ails and rigging, e&s;pecially at this time, as we were obliged to carry all the &s;ail we could to prevent our falling into a deep bight, on the Celebes &s;hore. The ravages of the &s;curvy were now univer&s;al, there not being one indi|vidual among us that was free, and the winds and currents being &s;o hard again&s;t us, that we could neither get we&s;ting nor &s;outhing to reach any place of refre&s;hment; the mind participated in the &s;ufferings of the body, and a univer&s;al
<PB N="626" REF="476">
de&s;pondency was reflected from one countenance to another, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e who were not able to come upon the deck. In this deplorable &s;ituation we continued till the 10th,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 10" UNIT="day"> and it is not perhaps very ea&s;y for the mo&s;t fertile imagination to conceive by what our danger and di&s;tre&s;s could po&s;&s;ibly be increa&s;ed; yet debilitated, &s;ick, and dying as we were, in &s;ight of land that we could not reach, and expo&s;ed to tempe&s;ts which we could not re&s;i&s;t, we had the additional misfortune to be attacked by a pirate: that this unexpected mi&s;chief might lo&s;e none of its force, it hap|pened at midnight, when the darkne&s;s that might almo&s;t be felt could not fail to co-operate with whatever tended to pro|duce confu&s;ion and terror. This &s;udden attack, however, rather rouzed than depre&s;&s;ed us, and though our enemy attempted to board us, before we could have the lea&s;t appre|hen&s;ion that an enemy was near, we defeated his purpo&s;e: he then plied us with what we &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;wivel-guns, and &s;mall arms, very bri&s;kly; but though he had the &s;tart of us, we &s;oon returned his &s;alute with &s;uch effect, that &s;hortly after he &s;unk, and all the unhappy wretches on board peri&s;hed. It was a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, but of what country, or how manned, it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to know. The Lieu|tenant, and one of the men, were wounded, though not dangerou&s;ly; part of our running rigging was cut, and we received &s;ome other &s;light damage. We knew this pirate to be a ve&s;&s;el which we had &s;een in the du&s;k of the evening, and we afterwards learnt that &s;he belonged to a freebooter, who had more than thirty &s;uch ve&s;&s;els under his command. The &s;mallne&s;s of our ve&s;&s;el encouraged the attack, and her &s;trength being &s;o much more than in proportion to her &s;ize, &s;uppo&s;ing her a merchantman, rendered it fatal.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 12th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 12" UNIT="day"> we fell in with the dangerous &s;hoals called the <HI>Spera Mondes,</HI> and had the mortification to
<PB N="627" REF="477">
find that the we&s;terly mon&s;oon was now &s;et in,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 12" UNIT="day"> again&s;t which, and the current, it was impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;hip to get as far we&s;tward as Batavia. As it was now nece&s;&s;ary to wait till the return of the ea&s;tern mon&s;oon, and the &s;hifting of the current; as we had buried thirteen of our crew, and no le&s;s than thirty more were at the point of death; as all the petty officers were among the &s;ick, and the Lieutenant and my&s;elf, who did all duties, in a feeble condition; it was impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould keep the &s;ea, and we had no chance of pre&s;erving tho&s;e who were &s;till alive, but by getting on &s;hore at &s;ome place, where re&s;t and refre&s;hment might be procured; I therefore determined that I would take advantage of our being &s;o far to the &s;outhward, and endea|vour to reach Maca&s;&s;ar, the principal &s;ettlement of the Dutch upon the i&s;land of Celebes.</P>
<P>The next day,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 13" UNIT="day"> we made &s;ome i&s;lands which lie not far from that place, and &s;aw, what &s;ometimes we took for &s;hoals, and &s;ometimes for boats, with men on board, but what afterwards appeared to be trees, and other drift floating about, with birds &s;itting upon them; we &s;uddenly found our&s;elves twenty miles farther to the &s;outhward than we expected, for the current, which had for &s;ome time &s;et us to the northward, had &s;et us to the &s;outhward during the night. We now hauled up ea&s;t, and E. &frac12; N. intending to have gone to the northward of a &s;hoal, which has no name in our Ea&s;t India Pilot, but which the Dutch call the Thumb: by noon, however, we found our&s;elves upon it, our water &s;hallowing at once to four fathom, with rocky ground. We now hauled off to the &s;outh we&s;t, and keeping the boat ahead to &s;ound, ran round the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hoal in ten and twelve fathom; our water deepening when we hauled off to the we&s;t, and &s;hallowing when we hauled off ea&s;t.

This i&s;land is, in the Engli&s;h Pilot, called Don Dinanga, but by the Dutch the North Brother.</P>
<P>Between the Three Brothers, and the main of Celebes, there is another i&s;land, much larger than either of them, called the I&s;land of Tonikiky; but none of them are inhabited, though there are a few huts belonging to fi&s;hermen upon them all. The pa&s;&s;age between the &s;hoal and this i&s;land is clear and good, with from ten to thirteen fathom, and a &s;andy bottom; but the &s;oundings are to be kept on the &s;ide of the i&s;land in twelve fathom, and never under ten: it is, however, very difficult and dangerous for &s;hips to fall in with the land this way without a pilot on board, for there are many &s;hoals and rocks under water. I ran in by a chart in the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Pilot, which upon the whole I found a good one, though the names of the i&s;lands, points, and bays, differ very much from tho&s;e by which they are now known. When we got near to the Celebes &s;hore, we had land and &s;ea breezes, which obliged us to edge along the coa&s;t, though our &s;trength was &s;o much reduced, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty we could work the &s;tream anchor.</P>
<P>In the evening of Tue&s;day the 15th,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> we anchored at about the di&s;tance of four miles from the town of Maca&s;&s;ar, which, according to my account, lies in latitude 5&deg; 10&prime; or 5&deg; 12&prime; S., longitude 117&deg; 28&prime; E. having &s;pent no le&s;s than five and thirty weeks in our pa&s;&s;age from the Streight of Magellan.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in my de&s;cription of as much as I &s;aw of this Streight, becau&s;e all the charts, both Engli&s;h and French, that I con&s;ulted, are extremely deficient
<PB N="629" REF="479">
and erroneous,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> and becau&s;e an exact knowlege of it may be of great &s;ervice to our China trade: the &s;hips by which that trade is carried on, may pa&s;s this way with as little danger as by the common one, which lies along the Pra&s;&s;el &s;hoals; and when they mi&s;s their pa&s;&s;age to China, in the &s;outh ea&s;t mon&s;oon, and lo&s;e the &s;ea&s;on, they may be &s;ure of a clear channel here, and fair winds at W. S. W. W. and round to W. N. W. in November, December, and the four following months: I am al&s;o of opinion, that it is a better and &s;horter way to go to the N. E. and ea&s;tward of the Phillipine I&s;lands, than to thread the Moluccas, or coa&s;t New Guinea, where there are &s;hoals, currents, and innumerable other dangers, as they were forced to do when the French were cruizing for them in the common pa&s;&s;age during the la&s;t war.</P>

<P>THE &s;ame night that we came to an anchor,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 15" UNIT="day"> at about eleven o'clock, a Dutchman came on board, who had been di&s;patched by the Governor, to learn who we were. When I made him under&s;tand that the &s;hip was an Engli&s;h man of war, he &s;eemed to be greatly alarmed, no man of war belonging to the King of Great Britain having ever been there before, and I could not by any means per&s;uade him to leave the deck, and go down into the cabbin; we parted, however, to all appearance, good friends.</P>
<P>The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 16" UNIT="day"> at break of day, I &s;ent the Lieutenant to the town, with a letter to the Governor, in which I ac|quainted him with the rea&s;on of my coming thither, and reque&s;ted the liberty of the port to procure refre&s;hments for my &s;hip's company, who were in a dying condition, and &s;helter for the ve&s;&s;el again&s;t the approaching &s;torms, till the return of a &s;it &s;ea&s;on for &s;ailing to the we&s;tward. I ordered that this letter &s;hould, without good rea&s;on to the contrary, be delivered into the Governor's own hand; but when my officer got to the wharf of the town, neither he nor any other per&s;on in the boat was &s;uffered to land. Upon his re|fu&s;al to deliver the letter to a me&s;&s;enger, the Governor was made acquainted with it, and two officers, called the &s;he|bander and the fi&s;cal, were &s;ent down to him, who, as a rea&s;on why he could not deliver the letter to the Governor him&s;elf, pretended that he was &s;ick, and &s;aid, that they
<PB N="631" REF="481">
came by his expre&s;s order to fetch it; <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 16" UNIT="day"> upon this the letter was at length delivered to them, and they went away. While they were gone, the officer and men were kept on board their boat, expo&s;ed to the burning heat of the &s;un, which was almo&s;t vertical at noon, and none of the country boats were &s;uffered to come near enough to &s;ell them any refre&s;hment. In the mean time, our people ob|&s;erved a great hurry and bu&s;tle on &s;hore, and all the &s;loops and ve&s;&s;els that were proper for war were fitted out with the utmo&s;t expedition: we &s;hould, however, I believe, have been an overmatch for their whole &s;ea force, if all our people had been well. In the mean time I intended to have gone and anchored clo&s;e to the town, but now the boat was ab|&s;ent, our united &s;trength was not &s;ufficient to weigh the anchor, though a &s;mall one. After waiting five hours in the boat, the Lieutenant was told that the Governor had ordered two gentlemen to wait upon me with an an&s;wer to my let|ter. Soon after he had returned, and made this report, the two gentlemen came on board, and we afterwards learnt that one of them was an en&s;ign of the garri&s;on, named Le Cerf, and the other Mr. Douglas, a writer of the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company: they delivered me the Governor's letter, but it proved to be written in Dutch, a language which not a &s;ingle per&s;on on board could under&s;tand: the two gentle|men who brought it, however, both &s;poke French, and one of them interpreted the contents to me in that language&punc; The purport of it was "that I &s;hould in&s;tantly depart from the port, without coming any nearer to the town; that I &s;hould not anchor on any part of the coa&s;t, or permit any of my people to land in any place that was under his juri&s;dic|tion." Before I made any reply to this letter, I &s;hewed the gentlemen who brought it the number of my &s;ick: at the &s;ight of &s;o many unhappy wretches, who were dying of lan|guor
<PB N="632" REF="482">
and di&s;ea&s;e,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 16" UNIT="day"> they &s;eemed to be much affected, and I then urged again the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity I was under of pro|curing refre&s;hment, to which they had been witne&s;&s;es, the cruelty and inju&s;tice of refu&s;ing to &s;upply me, which was not only contrary to treaty, as we were in a King's &s;hip, but to the laws of Nature as we were human beings: they &s;eemed to admit the force of this rea&s;oning, but they had a &s;hort and final an&s;wer ready, "that they had ab&s;olute and in|di&s;pen&s;ible orders from their ma&s;ters, not to &s;uffer any &s;hip, of whatever nation, to &s;tay at this port, and that the&s;e orders they mu&s;t implicitly obey." To this I replied, that per&s;ons in our &s;ituation had nothing wor&s;e to fear than what they &s;uffered, and that therefore if they did not immediately allow me the liberty of the port, to purcha&s;e refre&s;hments, and procure &s;helter, I would, as &s;oon as the wind would permit, in defiance of all their menaces, and all their force, go and anchor clo&s;e to the town; that if at la&s;t I &s;hould find my&s;elf unable to compel them to comply with requi&s;itions, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of which could not be controverted, I would run the &s;hip aground under their walls, and, after &s;elling our lives as dearly as we could, bring upon them the di&s;grace of having reduced a friend and ally to &s;o dreadful an extremity. At this they &s;eemed to be alarmed, as our &s;ituation alone was &s;ufficient to convince them that I was in earne&s;t, and urged me with great emotion to remain where I was, at lea&s;t till I had heard again from the Governor: to this, after &s;ome altercation, I con&s;ented, upon condition that I heard from the Governor before the &s;ea-breeze &s;et in the next day.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed all the remainder of this day, and all the night, in a &s;tate of anxiety, not unmixed with indignation, that greatly aggravated our di&s;tre&s;s; and very early the next morning,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> we had the mortification to &s;ee a &s;loop that
<PB N="633" REF="483">
mounted eight carriage-guns,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> and one of the ve&s;&s;els of the country, fitted out for war, with a great number of &s;oldiers on board, come from the town, and anchor under each of our bows. I immediately &s;ent my boat to &s;peak with them, but they would make no reply to any thing that was &s;aid. About noon, the &s;ea breeze &s;et in, and not having then heard again from the Governor, I got under &s;ail, and proceeded towards the town, according to my declaration, re&s;olving, if the ve&s;|&s;els that had anchored under our bows, &s;hould oppo&s;e us, to repre&s;s force with force as far as we were able: the&s;e two ve&s;&s;els, however, happily both for us and for them, con|tented them&s;elves with weighing anchor, and attending our motions.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after we had got under &s;ail, a hand&s;ome ve&s;&s;el, with a band of mu&s;ick, and &s;everal gentlemen on board, made up to us, and told us that they were &s;ent by the Go|vernor, but could not come aboard if we did not drop our anchor again; our anchor therefore was immediately dropped, and the gentlemen came on board: they proved to be Mr. Blydenburg, the fi&s;cal, Mr. Voll, the &s;hebander, an officer called the licence ma&s;ter, or ma&s;ter of the port, and Mr. Douglas the writer, who has been mentioned already. They expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize at my having got under &s;ail, and a&s;ked me what I intended to have done; I told them that I intended, neither more nor le&s;s than to fulfill the declara|tions I had made the day before; that ju&s;tified by the common rights of mankind, which were &s;uperior to every other law, I would, rather than have put again to &s;ea, where our de&s;truction either by &s;hipwreck, &s;ickne&s;s, or famine, was inevitable, have come up to their walls, and either have compelled them to furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;aries we wanted, or have run the &s;hip on &s;hore, &s;ince it was better to peri&s;h at once in a ju&s;t conte&s;t, than to &s;uffer the lingering mi&s;ery of
<PB N="634" REF="484">
anticipating the perdition that we could not avoid.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> I ob|&s;erved al&s;o, that no civilized people had ever &s;uffered even the captives of war to peri&s;h for want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, much le&s;s the &s;ubjects of an ally, who a&s;ked nothing but permi&s;&s;ion to purcha&s;e food with their money. They readily allowed the truth of all I had &s;aid, but &s;eemed to think I had been too ha&s;ty: I then ob&s;erved that I had waited the full time of my &s;tipulation, and they in return made &s;ome excu&s;e for their not having come &s;ooner, telling me, that, as a proof of their having admitted my claim, they had brought me &s;uch provi&s;ions as their country would afford. The&s;e were immediately taken on board, and con|&s;i&s;ted of two &s;heep, an elk ready killed, and a few fowls, with &s;ome vegetables and fruit. This mo&s;t welcome &s;upply was divided among the people, and that mo&s;t &s;alutary, and to us exqui&s;ite dainty, broth, made for the &s;ick. Another letter from the Governor was then produced, in which, to my great di&s;appointment, I was again ordered to leave the port, and to ju&s;tify the order, it was alleged, that to &s;uffer a &s;hip of any nation to &s;tay and trade either at this port, or any other part of the i&s;land, was contrary to the agreement which had been made by the Ea&s;t India Company with the native Kings and Governors of the country, who had already expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure on our account; and for farther particulars I was referred to the gentlemen that brought the letter, whom the Governor &s;tiled his commi&s;&s;aries. To the&s;e gentlemen I immediately ob&s;erved, that no &s;tipulation con|cerning trade could affect us, as we were a King's &s;hip; at the &s;ame time I produced my commi&s;&s;ion, it not being po&s;&s;ible to bring under the article of trade the &s;elling us food and refre&s;hments for our money, without the utmo&s;t violence to language and common &s;en&s;e. After this they made me &s;everal propo&s;itions, which I rejected, becau&s;e my departure
<PB N="635" REF="485">
from this place, before the return of the &s;ea&s;on, <MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> was in|cluded in them all. I then recurred to my former decla|ration, and to enforce it, &s;hewed them the corp&s;e of a man who had died that morning, and who&s;e life would probably have been &s;aved, if they had afforded us refre&s;hments when we fir&s;t came to an anchor upon their coa&s;t. This put them to a &s;tand, but after a &s;hort pau&s;e, they enquired very par|ticularly whether I had been among the &s;pice i&s;lands; I an|&s;wered them in the negative, and they appeared to be con|vinced that I &s;poke truth. After this we came to a better under&s;tanding, and they told me, that though they could not, without di&s;obedience to the mo&s;t direct and po&s;itive orders of the Company, &s;uffer us to remain here, yet that I was welcome to go to a little bay not far di&s;tant, where I &s;hould find effectual &s;helter from the bad mon&s;oon, and might erect an ho&s;pital for my &s;ick, a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time that provi&s;ion and refre&s;hments were more plenty there than at Maca&s;&s;ar, from whence, whatever el&s;e I wanted &s;hould be &s;ent me, and offering me a good pilot to carry me to my &s;tation. To this I gladly con&s;ented, upon condition that what they had offered &s;hould be confirmed to me by the Governor and Council of Maca&s;&s;ar, that I might be con&s;idered as under the protection of the Dutch nation, and that no vio|lence &s;hould be offered to my people: for all this they en|gaged their honour on behalf of the Governor and Council, promi&s;ing me the a&s;&s;urance I had required on the next day, and reque&s;ting that in the mean time I would remain where I was. I then enquired why the two ve&s;&s;els which were at anchor under our bows were allotted to that &s;tation, and they told me, for no other rea&s;on than to prevent the people of the country from offering us any violence. When matters were thus far &s;ettled between us, I expre&s;&s;ed my concern that, except a gla&s;s of wine, I could pre&s;ent them with
<PB N="636" REF="486">
nothing better then bad &s;alt meat,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 17" UNIT="day"> and bread full of wea|vels, upon which they very politely de&s;ired that I would permit their &s;ervants to bring in the victuals which had been dre&s;&s;ing in their own ve&s;&s;el; I readily con&s;ented, and a very genteel dinner was &s;oon &s;erved up, con&s;i&s;ting of fi&s;h, fle&s;h, vegetables, and fruit. It is with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure that I take this opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to the&s;e Gentlemen for the politene&s;s and humanity of their behaviour in their private capacity, and particularly to Mr. Douglas, who being qualified by his knowlege of the French language to interpret between us, undertook that office with a courte&s;y and politene&s;s which very much increa&s;ed the value of the favour. After this we parted, and at their leav|ing the &s;hip, I &s;aluted them with nine guns.</P>
<P>The next morning the Shebander was &s;ent to acquaint me,<MILESTONE N="Friday 18" UNIT="day"> that the Governor and Council had confirmed the en|gagement which had been made with me on their behalf. Every thing was now &s;ettled much to my &s;atisfaction, ex|cept the procuring money for my bills upon the govern|ment of Great Britain, which the Shebander &s;aid he would &s;olicit. At eight o'clock in the evening, he came on board again, to let me know that there was not any per&s;on in the town who had money to remit to Europe, and that there was not a dollar in the Company's che&s;t. I an&s;wered, that as I was not permitted to go on &s;hore to negociate my bills my&s;elf, I hoped they would give me credit, offering him bills for any debt I &s;hould contract, or to pay it at Batavia. To this the Shebander replied, that the Re&s;ident at Bonthain, the place to which I was going, would receive orders to &s;upply me with whatever I &s;hould want, and would be glad to take my bills in return, as he had money to remit, and was him&s;elf to go to Europe the next &s;ea&s;on. He told me

<P>The next day, in the afternoon, I received a letter,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 19" UNIT="day"> &s;igned by the Governor and Council of Maca&s;&s;ar, containing the rea&s;ons why I was &s;ent to Bonthain, and confirming the ver|bal agreement which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us.</P>
<P>Soon after, the En&s;ign M. le Cerf, the Secretary of the Council, and a pilot, came on board to attend us to Bon|thain. Le Cerf was to command the &s;oldiers who were on board the guard-boats; and the Secretary, as we afterwards di&s;covered, was to be a check upon the re&s;ident, who&s;e name was Swellingrabel. This Gentleman's father died Second Governor at the Cape of Good Hope, where he mar|ried an Engli&s;h lady of the name of Fothergill. Mr. Swel|lingrabel, the Re&s;ident here, married the daughter of Cor|nelius Sinkclaar, who had been Governor of Maca&s;&s;ar, and died about two years ago in England, having come hither to &s;ee &s;ome of his mother's relations.</P>

<P>THE next morning at day-break we &s;ailed,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 20" UNIT="day"> and the day following in the afternoon we anchored in Bon|thain road with our two guard-boats,<MILESTONE N="Monday 21" UNIT="day"> which were immedi|ately moored clo&s;e in to the &s;hore, to prevent the country boats from coming near us, and our boats from going near them. As &s;oon as I arrived at this place, I altered our reck|oning. I had lo&s;t about eighteen hours, in coming by the we&s;t, and the Europeans that we found here having come by the ea&s;t had gained about &s;ix, &s;o that the difference was ju&s;t a day.</P>
<P>I immediately waited upon the Re&s;ident, Mr. Swellingrabel, who &s;poke Engli&s;h but very imperfectly, and having &s;ettled with him all matters relating to money and provi&s;ions, a hou&s;e was allotted me near the &s;ea-&s;ide, and clo&s;e to a little palli&s;adoed fort of eight guns, the only one in this place, which I converted into an ho&s;pital, under the direction of the Surgeon; to this place I immediately &s;ent all the people who were thought incapable of recovering on board, and re&s;erved the re&s;t as a &s;ecurity again&s;t accidents. As &s;oon as our people were on &s;hore, a guard of thirty-&s;ix private men, two Ser|jeants, and two Corporals, all under the command of En&s;ign
<PB N="639" REF="490">
Le Cerf, was &s;et over them; and none of them were &s;uffered to go more than thirty yards from the ho&s;pital, nor were any of the country people allowed to come near enough to &s;ell them any thing; &s;o that our men got nothing of them, but through the hands of the Dutch &s;oldiers, who abu&s;ed their power very &s;hamefully. When they &s;aw any of the country people carrying what they thought our inva|lids would purcha&s;e, they fir&s;t took it away, and then a&s;ked the price: what was demanded &s;ignified little, the &s;oldier gave what he thought proper, which was &s;eldom one fourth of the value; and if the countryman ventured to expre&s;s any di&s;content, he gave him immediately an earne&s;t of perfect &s;atisfaction, by flouri&s;hing his broad-&s;word over his head; this was always &s;ufficient to &s;ilence complaint, and &s;end the &s;ufferer quietly away; after which the &s;oldier &s;old what he had thus acquired for profit of &s;ometimes more than a thou|&s;and <HI>per Cent.</HI> This behaviour was &s;o cruel to the natives, and &s;o injurious to us, that I ventured to complain of it to the Re&s;ident, and the other two Gentlemen, Le Cerf and the Secretary. The Re&s;ident, with becoming &s;pirit, reprimanded the &s;oldiers; but it produced &s;o little effect that I could not help entertaining &s;u&s;picions that le Cerf connived at the&s;e practi&s;es, and &s;hared the advantages which they produced. I &s;u&s;pected him al&s;o of &s;elling arrack to my people, of which I complained, but without redre&s;s, and I know that his &s;laves were employed to buy things at the market which his wife afterwards &s;old to us for more than twice as much as they co&s;t. The &s;oldiers were indeed guilty of many other irregularities: it was the duty of one of them by rotation to procure the day's provi&s;ion for the whole guard, a &s;ervice which he con&s;tantly performed by going into the country with his mu&s;quet and a bag; nor was the hone&s;t providetor always content with what the bag would contain, for one of

them, without any ceremony, drove down a young buffalo that belonged to &s;ome of the country people, and his com|rades not having wood at hand to dre&s;s it when it was killed, &s;upplied them&s;elves by pulling down &s;ome of the palli&s;adoes of the fort. When this was reported to me, I thought it &s;o extraordinary that I went on &s;hore to &s;ee the breach, and found the poor black people repairing it.</P>
<P>On the 26th,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 26" UNIT="day"> a &s;loop laden with rice was &s;ent out from this place in order to land her cargo at Maca&s;&s;ar; but after having attempted it three days &s;he was forced to return. The weather was now exceedingly tempe&s;tuous, and all na|vigation at an end from ea&s;t to we&s;t till the return of the ea&s;tern mon&s;oon. On the &s;ame day two large &s;loops that were bound to the ea&s;tward anchored here, and the next morning al&s;o a large &s;hip from Batavia,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 27" UNIT="day"> with troops on board for the Banda I&s;lands; but none of the crew of any of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were &s;uffered to &s;peak to any of our people, our boats being re&s;trained from going on board them, and theirs from coming on board us. As this was a mortifying re&s;triction we reque&s;ted Mr. Swellingrabel to buy us &s;ome &s;alt meat from the large &s;hip; and he was &s;o obliging as to procure us four ca&s;ks of very good European meat, two of pork and two of beef.</P>
<P>On the 28th a fleet of more than an hundred &s;ail of the &s;mall country ve&s;&s;els,<MILESTONE N="Monday 28" UNIT="day"> called Proas, anchored here; their burden is from twelve to eighteen and twenty ton, and they carry from &s;ixteen to twenty men. I was told that they carried on a fi&s;hery round the I&s;land, going out with one mon&s;oon, and coming back with the other, &s;o as always to keep under the lee of the land: the fi&s;h was &s;ent to the China market, and I ob&s;erved that all the&s;e ve&s;&s;els carried Dutch colours.</P>

any body &s;tirring in the &s;hip.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 29" UNIT="day"> On the 29th, while the&s;e things were the &s;ubjects of &s;peculation, one of my officers who came from the &s;hore brought me a letter, which he &s;aid had been delivered to him by a black man: it was directed, "To the Commander of the Engli&s;h &s;hip at Bon|thyn." That the Reader may under&s;tand this letter, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to acquaint him, that the i&s;land of Celebes is divided into &s;everal di&s;tricts, which are di&s;tinct &s;overeignties of the native Princes. The town of Maca&s;&s;ar is in a di&s;trict called al&s;o Maca&s;&s;ar, or Bony, the King of which is in alliance with the Dutch, who have been many times repul&s;ed in an at|tempt to reduce other parts of the i&s;land, one of which is inhabited by a people called Buggue&s;es, and another is called Waggs or To&s;ora. The town of To&s;ora is fortified with cannon, for the natives had been long furni&s;hed with fire-arms from Europe, before the Dutch &s;ettled them&s;elves at Maca&s;&s;ar in the room of the Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>The letter acquainted me, that a de&s;ign had been formed by the Dutch, in conjunction with the King of Bony, to cut us off: that the Dutch however were not to appear in it: that the bu&s;ine&s;s was to be done by a &s;on of the King of Bony, who was, be&s;ides a gratuity from the Dutch, to receive the plunder of the ve&s;&s;el for his reward, and who, with eight hundred men, was then at Bonthain for that purpo&s;e: that the motive was jealou&s;y of our forming a connection with the Buggue&s;es, and other people of the country, who were at enmity with the Dutch and their allies, and driving them out of the i&s;land; or at lea&s;t a &s;u&s;picion that, if we got back to England, &s;ome project of that kind might be founded upon the intelligence we &s;hould give, no Engli&s;h man of war, as I have already ob&s;erved, having ever been known to have vi&s;ited the i&s;land before.</P>
<P><PB N="643" REF="494">This letter was a new &s;ubject of &s;urpri&s;e and &s;peculation.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 29" UNIT="day"> It was extremely ill written with re&s;pect to the &s;tyle and manner, yet it did not therefore the le&s;s de&s;erve notice. How far the intelligence which it contained was true or fal&s;e, I was utterly unable to determine: it was po&s;&s;ible that the writer might be deceived him&s;elf; it was al&s;o po&s;&s;ible, that he might have &s;ome view in wilfully deceiving me: the fal&s;hood might procure &s;ome little reward for the kindne&s;s and zeal which it placed to his account, or it might give him an importance which would at lea&s;t be a gratifica|tion to his vanity. It behoved me however to take the &s;ame mea&s;ures as if I had known it to be true; and I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that I was not perfectly at ea&s;e when I recollected the recal of the Secretary and Le Cerf, with the large &s;loop, and part of the &s;oldiers, who were &s;aid to have been &s;ent hither for no other rea&s;on than to guard us again&s;t the in&s;ults of the country people; the a&s;&s;embling an armed force at Ma|ca&s;&s;ar, as it was &s;aid, for an expedition to Bally; and the little canoe that we had &s;een rowing round us in the night, not to mention the Governor's enquiry by letter, when we intended to leave the i&s;land. However, whether either our intelli|gence or conjectures were true or fal&s;e, we immediately went to work: we rigged the &s;hip, bent the &s;ails, unmoored, got &s;prings upon our cables, loaded all our guns, and barri|cadoed the deck.

<P>The Re&s;ident; Mr. Swellingrabel, was at this time ab&s;ent twenty miles up the country upon the Company's bu&s;ine&s;s, but had told me, that he &s;hould certainly return on the 1&s;t of

April, a day which I now expected with great impatience, e&s;pecially as an old drunken Serjeant was the mo&s;t re&s;pect|able per&s;on at the fort.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 31" UNIT="day"> In the evening of the 31&s;t, a packet of letters for him arrived here from Maca&s;&s;ar, which I con|&s;idered as a good omen, and a pledge of his return at the time appointed; but I conceived very different &s;entiments when I learnt that they were &s;ent to him. I did not &s;u&s;pect that he was privy to any &s;uch de&s;ign as had been intimated to me by the letter; but I could not help doubting, whether he was not kept in the country that he might be out of the way when it &s;hould be executed. In this &s;tate of anxiety and &s;u&s;pen&s;e I &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the fort, de&s;iring that an expre&s;s might be di&s;patched to him, to acquaint him that I wi&s;hed to &s;ee him immediately upon bu&s;ine&s;s of great importance, which would admit of no delay. Whether my me&s;&s;age was forwarded to him or not, I cannot tell; but having waited till the 4th of April,<MILESTONE N="April" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 4" UNIT="day"> without having &s;een him or received any an&s;wer, I wrote him a letter, reque&s;ting to &s;peak with him, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 5" UNIT="day"> and the next day he came on board. A few minutes convinced me that he was wholly a &s;tranger to any &s;uch de&s;ign as I had been made to apprehend; and he was clearly of opinion that no &s;uch de&s;ign had been formed. He &s;aid, indeed, that one Tomilaly, a coun&s;ellor or mini&s;ter of the King of Bony, had lately paid him a vi&s;it, and had not well accounted for his being in this part of the coun|try; and, at my reque&s;t, he very readily undertook to make farther enquiries concerning him and his people. The Re&s;i|dent and his attendants took notice that the &s;hip was put into a &s;tate of defence, and that every thing was ready for immediate action; and he told us, that the people on &s;hore had acquainted him, before he came on board, with our vi|gilance and activity, and in particular, with our having ex|erci&s;ed the &s;hip's company at &s;mall arms every day.

After a few days, he &s;ent me word that having made a very &s;trict enquiry, whether any other per&s;ons belonging to the King of Bony had been at Bonthain, he had been credibly informed that one of the Princes of that kingdom had been there in di&s;gui&s;e; but that of the eight hundred men who were &s;aid in my intelligence to be with him, he could find no traces; &s;o that, except they too, like the troops of the King of Brentford, were an army in di&s;gui&s;e, I knew that no &s;uch people could be in that country.</P>

It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that I did not deliver up the letter, becau&s;e the writer would cer|tainly have been puni&s;hed with equal &s;everity whether it was true or fal&s;e; but I returned the Governor a polite an|&s;wer, in which I ju&s;tified the mea&s;ures I had taken, without imputing any evil de&s;ign to him or his allies; and indeed there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that there was not &s;ufficient ground for the charge contained in the letter, though it is not equally probable that the writer believed it to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>At day-break on Sunday the 22d of May,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 22" UNIT="day"> we &s;ailed from this place, of which, and of the town of Maca&s;&s;ar, and the adjacent country, I &s;hall &s;ay but little, there being many ac|counts of the i&s;land of Celebes and its inhabitants already extant. The town is built upon a kind of point or neck of land, and is watered by a river or two which either run through, or very near it. It &s;eems to be large, and there is water for a &s;hip to come within half cannon &s;hot of the walls: the country about it is level, and has a mo&s;t beauti|ful appearance; it abounds with plantations, and groves of cocoa-nut trees, with a great number of hou&s;es inter&s;per&s;ed, by which it appears to abound with people. At a di&s;tance inland, the country ri&s;es into hills of a great height, and becomes rude and mountainous. The town lies in latitude 5&deg; 10&prime;, or 5&deg; 12&prime; S. and longitude by account 117&deg; 28&prime; E. of London.</P>
<P><PB N="647" REF="498">Bonthain is a large bay, where &s;hips may lie in perfect &s;ecurity during both the mon&s;oons: the &s;oundings are good and regular, and the bottom &s;oft mud; nor is there any danger coming in, but a ledge of rocks which are above water, and are a good mark for anchoring. The highe&s;t land in &s;ight here is called Bonthain hill, and when a &s;hip is in the offing at the di&s;tance of two or three miles from the land, &s;he &s;hould bring this hill north, or N. &frac12; W. and then run in with it and anchor. We lay right under it, at the di&s;tance of about a mile from the &s;hore. In this bay there are &s;everal &s;mall towns; that which is called Bonthain lies in the north ea&s;t part of the bay, and here is the &s;mall palli&s;adoed fort that has been mentioned already, on which there are mounted eight guns that carry a ball of about eight pounds weight: it is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to keep the coun|try people in &s;ubjection, and is intended for no other pur|po&s;e: it lies on the &s;outh &s;ide of a &s;mall river, and there is water for a &s;hip to come clo&s;e to it. The Dutch Re&s;ident has the command of the place, and of Bullocomba, another town which lies about twenty miles farther to the ea&s;tward, where there is &s;uch another fort, and a few &s;oldiers, who at the proper &s;ea&s;on are employed in gathering the rice, which the people pay as a tax to the Dutch.</P>
<P>Wood and water are to be procured here in great plenty; we cut our wood near the river, under Bonthain hill: our water was procured partly from that river, and partly from another; when from the other, our boat went above the fort with the ca&s;ks that were to be filled, where there is a good rolling way; but as the river is &s;mall, and has a bar, the boat, after it is loaded, can come out only at high water. There are &s;everal other &s;mall rivers in the bay, from which water may be got upon occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="648" REF="499">We procured plenty of fre&s;h provi&s;ions all the while we lay here at a rea&s;onable rate: the beef is excellent; but it would be difficult to procure enough of it for a &s;quadron. Rice may be had in any quantity, &s;o may fowls and fruit: there are al&s;o abundance of wild hogs in the woods, which may be purcha&s;ed at a low price, as the natives, being Ma|hometans, never eat them.

<P>WHEN we left Bonthain Bay, we kept along the &s;hore,<MILESTONE N="Sunday 22" UNIT="day"> at the di&s;tance of two or three miles, till evening, and then anchored for the night, in the pa&s;&s;age between the two i&s;lands of Celebes and Tonikaky, in &s;even fathom and a half, with a bottom of &s;oft mud. The next morning,<MILESTONE N="Monday 23" UNIT="day"> we got again under &s;ail, and took our departure from Tonikaky, which, according to my account, lies in latitude 5&deg; 31&prime; S, longitude 117&deg; 17&prime; E.; the variation here was 1&deg; W. We went to the &s;outhward of Tonikaky, and &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward. About three o'clock in the afternoon, we were abrea&s;t of the ea&s;termo&s;t of the i&s;lands which in the Dutch charts are called Tonyn's I&s;lands. This i&s;land bore from us about N. by W. at the di&s;tance of four miles, and the two we&s;termo&s;t were in &s;ight. The&s;e three i&s;lands make a kind of right angle triangle with each other: the di&s;tance between the ea&s;termo&s;t and we&s;termo&s;t is about eleven miles, and their relative bearings are very nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t. The di&s;tance between the two we&s;termo&s;t is nearly the &s;ame, and they bear to each other S. by E. and N. by W. About &s;ix o'clock, having ju&s;t &s;ounded, and got no ground, we &s;uddenly found our&s;elves upon a &s;hoal, with not three fa|thom, and the water being &s;mooth and clear, we could &s;ee great crags of coral rocks under our bottom: we imme|diately threw all the &s;ails aback, and happily got off with|out

At this time, we had the two we&s;termo&s;t of the Tonyn I&s;lands in one, hearing N. by W. at the di&s;tance of &s;omewhat more than four miles from the neare&s;t. This is a very dangerous &s;hoal, and is not laid down in any chart that I have &s;een: it &s;eemed to extend it&s;elf to the &s;outhward and we&s;tward, all round the two we&s;termo&s;t of the&s;e three i&s;lands, for near &s;ix miles, but about the ea&s;termo&s;t i&s;land there &s;eemed to be no danger; there was al&s;o a clear pa&s;&s;age between this i&s;land and the other two.

<P>In the afternoon of the 25th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 25" UNIT="day"> we found the water much di&s;coloured, upon which we &s;ounded, and had five and thirty fathom with &s;oft mud: &s;oon after we went over the northermo&s;t part of a &s;hoal, and had no more than ten fa|thom, with &s;oft mud. In this place, where we found the water &s;hallowe&s;t, it was very foul; it &s;eemed to be &s;till &s;hallower to the &s;outhward, but to the northward of us it appeared to be clear. We had no ob&s;ervation this day, by which I could a&s;certain the latitude, but I believe this to be the northermo&s;t part of the &s;hoals that lie to the ea&s;tward of the i&s;land Madura, and in the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Pilot are called Bralleron's Shoals, the &s;ame which in the Dutch charts are called Kalcain's Eylandens.

I then de&s;ired to know what an&s;wer he had been in&s;tructed to give to my letter, concerning the refitting of the &s;hip; upon which he told me, that the Council had taken offence at my having u&s;ed the word <HI>hope,</HI> and not written in the &s;tile of reque&s;t, which had been invariably adopted by all merchants upon the like occa&s;on: I replied, that no offence was intended on my part, and that I had u&s;ed the fir&s;t words which occurred to me, as proper to expre&s;s my meaning. Thus we parted, and I heard nothing more of them till the afternoon of the 9th, when the &s;hebander,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 9" UNIT="day"> and the &s;ame two gentlemen, came to me a &s;econd time. The &s;hebander &s;aid, that he was then commi&s;&s;ioned from the council, to require a writing under my hand, &s;ignifying that I believed the report of an intention formed at the i&s;land of Celebes to cut off my &s;hip, was fal&s;e and malicious, &s;aying that he hoped I had a better opinion of the Dutch nation than to &s;uppo&s;e them capable of &s;uffering &s;o execrable a fact to be perpetrated under their Government. Mr. Garri&s;on then read me a certificate, which, by order of the council, had been drawn up for me to &s;ign: as, whatever was my opinion, I did not think it advi&s;able to &s;ign &s;uch a certi|ficate, e&s;pecially as it appeared to be made a condition of complying with my reque&s;t by the delay of an an&s;wer during this &s;olicitation, I de&s;ired the &s;hebander to &s;hew me
<PB N="654" REF="505">
his authority for the requi&s;ition he had made:<MILESTONE N="Thursday 9" UNIT="day"> he replied, that he had no te&s;timony of authority but the notoriety of his being a public officer, and the evidence of the gentlemen that were with him, confirming his own declaration, that he acted in this particular by the expre&s;s order of Council. I then repeated my reque&s;t, that whatever the Council required of me might be given me in writing, that the &s;en&s;e of it might be fixed and certain, and that I might have time to con&s;ider of my reply; but he gave me to under&s;tand that he could not do this without an order from the Council, and I then ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ign the paper, at the &s;ame time de&s;iring an an&s;wer to my letter, which they not being pre|pared to give, we parted, not in very good humour with each other.</P>
<P>After this, I waited in a fruitle&s;s expectation till the 15th,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> when the &s;ame three gentlemen came to me the third time, and &s;aid they had been &s;ent to tell me that the Council had prote&s;ted again&s;t my behaviour at Maca&s;&s;ar, and my having refu&s;ed to &s;ign the certificate which had been required of me, as an in&s;ult upon them, and an act of inju&s;tice to their na|tion. I replied, that I was not con&s;cious of having in any in&s;tance acted contrary to the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two kingdoms, unworthy of my character as an officer, ho|noured with a commi&s;&s;ion of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, or un|&s;uitable to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, though I did not think I had been u&s;ed by the Governor of Maca&s;&s;ar as the &s;ubject of a friend and ally; de&s;iring that if they had any thing to allege again&s;t me, it might be riduced to writing, and laid before the King my Ma&s;ter, to whom alone I thought my|&s;elf amenable. With this an&s;wer they again departed, and the next day,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> having not yet received any an&s;wer to my let|ter, I wrote a &s;econd, directed like the fir&s;t, in which I re|pre&s;ented that the &s;hip's leaks were every day increa&s;ing,
<PB N="655" REF="506">
and urged, in more pre&s;&s;ing terms,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> my reque&s;t that &s;he might be repaired, and that the u&s;e of wharfs and &s;tore-hou&s;es might be afforded me.</P>
<P>On the 18th, the &s;hebander came again to me,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 18" UNIT="day"> and ac|quainted me, that the Council had given orders for the re|pair of the &s;hip at Onru&s;t, and as there was no &s;tore-hou&s;e empty, had appointed one of the Company's ve&s;&s;els to attend me, and take in my &s;tores. I enquired whether there was not an an&s;wer to my letter in writing; to which he an&s;wered in the negative, adding, that it was not u&s;ual, a me&s;&s;age by him, or &s;ome other officer, having been always thought &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>After this I was &s;upplied, for my money, with every thing I could de&s;ire, from the Company's &s;tores, without any fur|ther difficulty.</P>
<P>A pilot was ordered to attend me, and on the 22d,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s; 22" UNIT="day"> we an|chored at Onru&s;t, where, having cleared the &s;hip, and put her &s;tores on board the Company's ve&s;&s;el, we found the bow|&s;prit and cap, as well as the main yard, rotten, and alto|gether un&s;erviceable, the &s;heathing every where eaten off by the worms, and the main planks of the &s;hip's bottom &s;o much damaged and decayed, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to heave her down, before &s;he could be &s;ufficiently repaired to &s;ail for Europe; but as other &s;hips were already heaved down, and con&s;equently the wharfs at this time pre-occu|pied, the carpenters could not begin their work till the 24th of July.<MILESTONE N="July" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Sunday 24" UNIT="day"></P>
<P>Under the hands of the&s;e people the &s;hip continued till Tue&s;day the 16th of Augu&s;t.<MILESTONE N="Augu&s;t" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> When they came to examine her bottom, they found it &s;o bad that they were unanimou&s;ly of opinion it &s;hould be &s;hifted: this, however, I &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed; I knew &s;he was an old &s;hip, and I was afraid that
<PB N="656" REF="507">
if her bottom was opened it might be found &s;till wor&s;e than it was thought,<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> and po&s;&s;ibly &s;o bad as that, like the Fal|mouth, &s;he might be condemned; I therefore de&s;ired that a good &s;heathing only might be put over all; but the <HI>baw&s;e,</HI> or ma&s;ter carpenter, would not con&s;ent, except I would cer|tify under my hand, that what &s;hould be done to the &s;hip was not according to his judgment but my own, which he &s;aid was nece&s;&s;ary for his ju&s;tification, if, after &s;uch repairs only as I thought fit to direct had been made, the ship &s;hould come &s;hort of her port. As I thought this a rea&s;on|able propo&s;ition, I readily complied; but as I was now become an&s;werable for the fate of the &s;hip, I had her care|fully examined by my own carpenter and his mate, my&s;elf and officers always attending. The but ends of the planks that joined to the &s;tern were &s;o open, that a man's hand might be thru&s;t in between; &s;even chain-plates were broken and decayed, the iron work, in general, was in a very bad &s;tate; &s;everal of the knees were loo&s;e, and &s;ome of them were broken.</P>
<P>While I remained here, two &s;hips belonging to our India Company put into this port, and we found, among other private &s;hips from India, one called the Dudly, from Bengal, which had proved &s;o leaky that it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry her back. Application had been made to the Governor and Council for leave to careen her, which had been granted; but as the wharfs had been kept in continual u&s;e, &s;he had been put off above four months. The Captain, not without rea&s;on, was apprehen&s;ive that he might be kept here till the worms had eaten through the bottom of his ve&s;&s;el, and knowing that I had received particular civilities from Ad|miral Houting, applied to me to intercede for him, which I was very happy to do with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that a wharf was immediately allotted her. M. Houting is an old man, and
<PB N="657" REF="508">
an Admiral in the &s;ervice of the States, with the rank of Commander in Chief of their marine, and the &s;hips belong|ing to the Company in India. He received his fir&s;t maritime knowlege on board an Engli&s;h man of war, &s;peaks Engli&s;h and French extremely well, and does honour to the &s;ervice both by his abilities and politene&s;s: he was &s;o obliging as to give me a general invitation to his table, in con&s;equence of which I was often with him, and it is with plea&s;ure that I take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgment of the favours I received from him, and hearing this te&s;timony to his public and private merit: he was indeed the only officer belonging to the Company from whom I received any civility, or with whom I had the lea&s;t communication; for I found them, in general, a re&s;erved and &s;upercilious &s;et of people. The Governor, although the &s;ervant of a repub|lic, takes upon him&s;elf more &s;tate, in &s;ome particulars, than any &s;overeign prince in Europe. Whenever he goes abroad, he is attended by a party of hor&s;e guards, and two black men go before his coach, in the manner of running footmen, each having a large cane in his hand, with which they not only clear the way, but &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;e all who do not pay the homage that is expected from people of all ranks, as well tho&s;e belonging to the country as &s;trangers. Almo&s;t every body in this place keeps a carriage, which is drawn by two hor&s;es, and driven by a man upon a box, like our chariots, but is open in front: whoever, in &s;uch a car|riage, meets the Governor, either in the town or upon the road, is expected not only to draw it on one &s;ide, but to get out of it, and make a mo&s;t re&s;pectful obei&s;ance while his Excellency's coach goes by; nor mu&s;t any carriage that follows him drive pa&s;t on any account, but keep behind him, however pre&s;&s;ing be the nece&s;&s;ity for ha&s;te. A very mortifying homage, of the &s;ame kind, is al&s;o exacted by the
<PB N="658" REF="509">
members of the Council, called Edele Heeren, for whoever meets them is obliged to &s;top his coach, and, though not to get out, to &s;tand up in it, and make his reverence: the&s;e Edele Heeren are preceded by one black man with a &s;tick, nor mu&s;t any per&s;on pre&s;ume to pa&s;s their carriage any more than that of the Governor. The&s;e ceremonies are generally complied with by the Captains of Indiamen, and other trading &s;hips; but having the honour to bear his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion, I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to pay to a Dutch Governor, any homage which is not paid to my own Sovereign: it is, however, con&s;tantly required of the King's officers; and two or three days after I came hither, the land|lord of the hotel where I lodged told me, he had been ordered by the &s;hebander to let me know that my carriage, as well as others, mu&s;t &s;top, if I &s;hould meet the Governor or any of the Council; but I de&s;ired him to acquaint the &s;hebander that I could not con&s;ent to perform any &s;uch ceremony; and upon his intimating &s;omewhat about the black men with &s;ticks, I told him that if any in&s;ult &s;hould be offered me, I knew how to defend my&s;elf, and would take care to be upon my guard; at the &s;ame time pointing to my pi&s;tols, which then happened to lie upon the table: upon this he went away, and about three hours afterwards he returned, and told me he had orders from the Governor to acquaint me that I might do as I plea&s;ed. The hotel at which I re&s;ided is licen&s;ed by the Governor and Council, and all &s;trangers are obliged to take up their abode there, except officers in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, who are allowed private lodgings, which, however, I did not chu&s;e.</P>
<P>At this place I continued between three and four months, and during all that time I had the honour to &s;ee the Gover|nor but twice: the fir&s;t time was at my arrival, when I waited upon him at one of his hou&s;es, a little way in the country;
<PB N="659" REF="510">
the next was in town, as he was walking before his hou&s;e there, when I addre&s;&s;ed him upon a particular occa&s;ion. Soon after the news of the Prince of Orange's marriage arrived here, he gave a public entertainment, to which I had the honour of being invited; but having heard that Commodore Tinker, upon a like occa&s;ion, finding that he was to be placed below the gentlemen of the Dutch Coun|cil, had abruptly left the room, and was followed by all the Captains of his &s;quadron; and being willing to avoid the di&s;agreeable dilemma of either &s;itting below the Council, or following the Commodore's example, I applied to the Gover|nor to know the &s;tation that would be allotted me, before I accepted his invitation, and finding that I could not be per|mitted to take place of the Council, I declined it. On both the&s;e occa&s;ions I &s;poke to his Excellency by an Engli&s;h mer|chant, who acted as an interpreter. The fir&s;t time he had not the civility to offer me the lea&s;t refre&s;hment, nor did he the la&s;t time &s;o much as a&s;k me to go into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The defects of the &s;hip were at length repaired, much to my &s;atisfaction, and I thought &s;he might then &s;afely proceed to Europe, though the Dutch carpenters were of a different opinion. The proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;ailing was not yet arrived, and my worthy friend, Admiral Houting, repre&s;ented that if I went to &s;ea before the proper time, I &s;hould meet with &s;uch weather off the Cape of Good Hope as would make me repent it; but being very ill my&s;elf, and the people being &s;ickly, I thought it better to run the ri&s;k of a few hard gales off the Cape, than remain longer in this unhealthy place, e&s;pecially as the we&s;t mon&s;oon was &s;etting in, during which the mortality here is yet greater than at other times.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 15th of September,<MILESTONE N="September" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> therefore, we &s;et &s;ail from Onru&s;t, where the &s;hip had been refitted, without
<PB N="660" REF="511">
returning,<MILESTONE N="Wedne&s;. 15" UNIT="day"> as is u&s;ual, into Batavia Road; and as I was not well, I &s;ent my Lieutenant to take leave of the Governor on my behalf, and offer my &s;ervice, if he had any di&s;patches for Europe. It was happy for me that I was able to procure a &s;upply of Engli&s;h &s;eamen here, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not at la&s;t have been able to bring the &s;hip home, for I had now lo&s;t no le&s;s than four and twenty of the hands I had brought out of Europe, and had four and twenty more &s;o ill, that &s;even of them died in our pa&s;&s;age to the Cape.</P>
<P>On the 20th,<MILESTONE N="Monday 20" UNIT="day"> we anchored on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of Prince's I&s;land, in the Streight of Sunda, and the next morning, I &s;ent out the boats for wood and water: of water, however, we could not get a &s;ufficient quantity to complete our &s;tock, for there had not yet been rain enough to &s;upply the &s;prings, the wet mon&s;oon having but ju&s;t &s;et in. At this time we had the wind &s;o fre&s;h from the &s;outh ea&s;t, which made this part of the i&s;land a lee &s;hore, that I could not get under &s;ail till the 25th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 25" UNIT="day"> when, it being more moderate, we weighed, and worked over to the Java &s;hore. In the evening, we anchored in a bay called by &s;ome New Bay, and by others Canty Bay, which is formed by an i&s;land of the &s;ame name. We had fourteen fathom water, with a fine &s;andy bottom. The peak of Prince's I&s;land bore N.13 W. the we&s;termo&s;t point of New I&s;land S. 82 W. and the ea&s;termo&s;t point of Java that was in &s;ight, N. E. Our di&s;tance from the Java &s;hore was about a mile and a quarter, and from the watering-place a mile and an half. New Bay is the be&s;t place for wooding and watering of any in the&s;e parts: the water is extremely clear, and &s;o good that I made my people &s;tave all that we had taken in at Batavia and Prince's I&s;land, and &s;upply it from this place. It is procured from a fine &s;trong run on the Java &s;hore, which falls down from the land into the &s;ea, and by means of a hoa&s;e it may be laded into the boats,
<PB N="661" REF="512">
and the ca&s;ks filled without putting them on &s;hore,<MILESTONE N="Friday 25" UNIT="day"> which renders the work very ea&s;y and expeditious. There is a little reef of rocks within which the boats go, and lie in as &s;mooth water, and as effectually &s;heltered from any &s;well, as if they were in a mill-pond; nor does the reef run out &s;o far as to be dangerous to &s;hipping, though the contrary is a&s;&s;erted in Herbert's Directory; and if a &s;hip, when lying there, &s;hould be driven from her anchors by a wind that blows upon the &s;hore, &s;he may, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, run up the pa&s;&s;age between New I&s;land and Java, where there is &s;ufficient depth of water for the large&s;t ve&s;&s;el, and a harbour, in which, being land-locked, &s;he will find perfect &s;ecurity. Wood may be had any where either upon Java or New I&s;land, neither of which, in this part, are inhabited.</P>
<P>Having in a few days completed our wood and water, we weighed and &s;tood out of the Streight of Sunda, with a fine fre&s;h gale at South Ea&s;t, which did not leave us till the i&s;land of Java was &s;even hundred leagues behind us.</P>
<P>On Monday the 23d of November,<MILESTONE N="November" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 23" UNIT="day"> <MILESTONE N="Saturday 28" UNIT="day"> we di&s;covered the coa&s;t of Africa; at day&mdash;break on the 28th we made the Table Land of the Cape of Good Hope, and the &s;ame evening an|chored in the bay. We found here only a Dutch &s;hip from Europe, and a &s;now belonging to the place, which however was in the Company's &s;ervice, for the inhabitants are not permitted to have any &s;hipping.</P>
<P>Table Bay is a good harbour in &s;ummer, but not in winter; &s;o that the Dutch will not permit any of their ve&s;&s;els to lie here longer than the 15th of May, which an&s;wers to our November. After that time, all &s;hips go to Fal&s;e Bay, which is well &s;heltered from the north we&s;t winds, which blow here with great violence.</P>
<P><PB N="662" REF="513">At this place we breathed a pure air, had whole&s;ome food, and went freely about the country which is extremely plea|&s;ant, &s;o that I began to think my&s;elf already in Europe.

I &s;ent a boat out to di&s;cover the anchoring-place which is called Cro&s;s-hill Bay, while we kept running along the north ea&s;t and north &s;ide of the i&s;land, till we came to the north we&s;t extremity of it, and in the afternoon anchored in the bay we &s;ought. The way to find this place at once, is to bring the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;picuous hill upon the i&s;land to bear S. E.; when the &s;hip is in this po&s;i|tion, the Bay will be open, right in the middle between two other hills, the we&s;termo&s;t of which is called Cro&s;s-hill, and gives name to the Bay. Upon this hill there is a flag-&s;taff, which if a &s;hip brings to bear S. S. E. &frac12; E. or S. E. by E. and runs in, keeping it &s;o till &s;he is in ten fathom water, &s;he will be in the be&s;t part of the Bay. In our run along the north ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, I ob&s;erved &s;everal other &s;mall &s;andy bays, in &s;ome of which my boat found good anchor|age,
<PB N="663" REF="514">
and &s;aw plenty of turtle,<MILESTONE N="Saturday 30" UNIT="day"> though they are not &s;o con|venient as this, where we had plenty of turtle too. The beach here is a fine white &s;and; the landing-place is at &s;ome rocks, which lie about the middle of the Bay, and may be known by a ladder of ropes which hangs from the top to mount them by. In the evening I landed a few men to turn the turtle that &s;hould come on &s;hore during the night, and in the morning I found that they had thus &s;ecured no le&s;s than eighteen, from four hundred to &s;ix hundred weight each, and the&s;e were as many as we could well &s;tow on the deck. As there are no inhabitants upon this i&s;land, it is a cu&s;tom for the &s;hips that touch at it to leave a letter in a bottle, with their names and de&s;tination, the date, and a few other particulars. We complied with this cu&s;tom,<MILESTONE N="February" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Monday 1" UNIT="day"> and in the evening of Monday the 1&s;t of February, we weighed anchor and &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>On Friday the 19th,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> we di&s;covered a &s;hip at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to leeward in the &s;outh we&s;t quarter, which hoi&s;ted French colours; &s;he continued in &s;ight all day, and the next morning we perceived that &s;he had greatly out&s;ailed us during the night; &s;he made a tack however in order to get farther to windward, and as it is not u&s;ual for &s;hips to turn to windward in the&s;e parts, it was evident that &s;he had tacked in order to &s;peak with us. By noon &s;he was near enough to hail us, and, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, made u&s;e both of my name and that of the &s;hip, enquiring after my health, and telling me, that after the return of the Dolphin to Eu|rope, it was believed we had &s;uffered &s;hipwreck in the Streight of Magellan, and that two &s;hips had been &s;ent out in que&s;t of us. I a&s;ked, in my turn, who it was that was &s;o well acquainted with me and my &s;hip, and with the opinions that had been formed of us in Europe after the return of our
<PB N="664" REF="515">
companion,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> and how this knowlege had been acquired. I was an&s;wered that the &s;hip which hailed us was in the &s;er|vice of the French Ea&s;t India Company, commanded by M. Bougainville; that &s;he was returning to England from the I&s;le of France; that what was thought of the Swallow in England, had been learnt from the French Gazette at the Cape of Good Hope; and that we were known to be that ve&s;&s;el by the letter which had been found in the bottle at the I&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion a few days after we had left that place. An offer was then made of &s;upplying me with refre&s;hments, if I wanted any, and I was a&s;ked if I had any letters to &s;end to France. I returned thanks for the offer of refre&s;hments, which however was a mere verbal civility, as it was known that I had lately &s;ailed from the places where M. Bougainville him&s;elf had been &s;upplied; but I &s;aid that I had received letters for France from &s;ome Gentlemen of that country at the Cape, and if he would &s;end his boat on board they &s;hould be delivered to his me&s;|&s;enger. Thus was an occa&s;ion furni&s;hed for what I have rea&s;on to believe was the principal object of M. Bougainville in &s;peaking with us: a boat was immediately &s;ent on board, and in her a young officer, dre&s;t in a wai&s;tcoat and trow&s;ers; whether he was thus dre&s;&s;ed by de&s;ign I &s;hall not determine, but I &s;oon perceived that his rank was much &s;uperior to his appearance. He came down to me in my cabbin, and after the u&s;ual compliments had pa&s;&s;ed, I a&s;ked him how he came to go home &s;o &s;oon in the &s;ea&s;on; to which he replied, that there had been &s;ome di&s;agreement between the Governor and inhabitants of the I&s;le of France,, and that he had been &s;ent home in ha&s;te with di&s;patches: this &s;tory was the more plau&s;ible, as I had heard of the di&s;pute between the Gover|nor and inhabitants of the I&s;le of France, from a French Gentleman, who came from thence, at the Cape of Good

Bougainville to have been &s;ent in ha&s;te to Europe with di&s;|patches, I could not account for his lo&s;ing the time which it co&s;t him to &s;peak with me; I therefore ob&s;erved to this Gentleman, that although he had accounted for his coming before the u&s;ual time from the I&s;le of France, he had not ac|counted for his coming at an unu&s;ual time from India, which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e. To this, however, he rea|dily replied, that they had made only a &s;hort trading voyage on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Sumatra. I then enquired, what commodities he had brought from thence; and he an&s;wered, cocoa-nut oil, and rattans: but, &s;aid I, the&s;e are commodi|ties which it is not u&s;ual to bring into Europe; it is true, &s;aid he, but the&s;e commodities we left at the I&s;le of France, the oil for the u&s;e of the i&s;land, and the rattans for &s;hips which were to touch there in their way to China, and in exchange we took in another freight for Europe; this freight I think he &s;aid was pepper, and his whole tale being at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible, I a&s;ked him no more que&s;tions. He then told me, he had heard at the Cape, that I had been with Commodore Byron at Falkland's I&s;lands; and, &s;aid he, I was on board the French &s;hip that met you in the Streight of Ma|gellan, which mu&s;t have been true, for he mentioned &s;everal incidents that it was otherwi&s;e highly improbable he &s;hould know, particularly the &s;tore-&s;hip's running aground, and many of the difficulties that occurred in that part of the Streight which we pa&s;&s;ed together: by this conver&s;ation he contrived to introduce &s;everal enquiries, concerning the we&s;tern part of the Streight, the time it co&s;t me to get through, and the difficulties of the navigation; but per|ceiving that I declined giving any account of the&s;e particu|lars, he changed his &s;ubject. He &s;aid, he had heard that
<PB N="666" REF="517">
we lo&s;t an officer and &s;ome men in an engagement with the Indians; <MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> and taking notice that my &s;hip was &s;mall, and a bad &s;ailer, he in&s;inuated that we mu&s;t have &s;uffered great hard&s;hip in &s;o long a voyage; but, &s;aid he, it is thought to be &s;afer and plea&s;anter &s;ailing in the South Sea than any where el&s;e. As I perceived that he waited for a reply, I &s;aid, that the great ocean, called the South Sea, extended almo&s;t from one pole to the other; and therefore, although that part of it which lay between the Tropics might ju&s;tly be called the Pacific, on account of the trade-winds that blow there all the year; yet without the Tropics, on either &s;ide, the winds were variable, and the &s;eas turbulent. In all this he readily acquie&s;ced, and finding that he could not draw from me any thing to &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity, by &s;tarting leading &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation, he began to propo&s;e his que&s;tions in direct terms, and de&s;ired to know on which &s;ide the equator I had cro&s;&s;ed the South Seas. As I did not think proper to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, and wi&s;hed to prevent others of the &s;ame kind, I ro&s;e up &s;omewhat abruptly, and I believe with &s;ome marks of di&s;plea&s;ure: at this he &s;eemed to be a little di&s;concerted, and I believe was about to make an apology for his curio|&s;ity, but I prevented him, by de&s;iring that he would make my compliments to his Captain, and in return for his ob|liging civilities pre&s;ent him with one of the arrows that had wounded my men, winch I immediately went into my bed|room to fetch: he followed me, looking about him with great curio&s;ity, as indeed he had done from the time of his fir&s;t coming on board, and having received the arrow, he took his leave.</P>
<P>After he was gone, and we had made &s;ail, I went upon the deck, where my Lieutenant a&s;ked me, if my vi&s;itor had entertained me with an account of his voyage. This led me
<PB N="667" REF="518">
to tell him the general purport of our conver&s;ation,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> upon which he a&s;&s;ured me that the tale I had heard was a fiction, for, &s;ays he, the boat's crew could not keep their &s;ecret &s;o well as their officer, but after a little conver&s;ation told one of our people, who was born at Quebec, and &s;poke French, that they had been round the globe as well as we. This naturally excited a general curio&s;ity, and with a very little difficulty we learnt that they had &s;ailed from Europe in company with another &s;hip, which, wanting &s;ome repair, had been left at the I&s;le of France; that they had attempted to pa&s;s the Streight of Magellan the fir&s;t &s;ummer, but not being able, had gone back, and wintered in the river De la Plata; that the &s;ummer afterwards they had been more &s;uc|ce&s;sful, and having pa&s;&s;ed the Streight, &s;pent two months at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes. My Lieutenant told me al&s;o, that a boy in the French boat &s;aid he had been upon that i&s;land two years, and that while he was there, an Engli&s;h frigate put into the road, but did not anchor, mentioning the time as well as he could recollect, by which it appeared that the frigate he had &s;een was the Swallow. On the boy's being a&s;ked how he came to be &s;o long upon the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes, he &s;aid that he had been taken upon the Spani&s;h coa&s;t in the We&s;t Indies in a &s;muggling party, and &s;ent thither by the Spaniards; but that by the French &s;hip, in who&s;e boat he came on board us, having touched there, he had regained his liberty. After having received this in|formation from my Lieutenant, I could ea&s;ily account for M. Bougainville's having made a tack to &s;peak to me, and for the conver&s;ation and behaviour of my vi&s;itor; but I was now more di&s;plea&s;ed at the que&s;tions he had a&s;ked me than before, for if it was improper for him to communicate an account of his voyage to me, it was equally improper for me to communicate an account of my voyage to him; and I
<PB N="668" REF="519">
thought an artful attempt to draw me into a breach of my obligation to &s;ecrecy,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> while he impo&s;ed upon me by a fiction that he might not violate his own, was neither liberal nor ju&s;t. As what the boat's crew told my people, differs in &s;everal particulars from the account printed by M. Bougain|ville, I &s;hall not pretend to determine how much of it is true; but I was then very &s;orry that the Lieutenant had not communicated to me the intelligence he received, &s;uch as it was, before my gue&s;t left me, and I was now very de&s;irous to &s;peak with him again, but this was impo&s;&s;ible; for though the French &s;hip was foul from a long voyage, and we had ju&s;t been cleaned, &s;he &s;hot by us as if we had been at anchor, notwith&s;tanding we had a fine fre&s;h gale and all our &s;ails &s;et.</P>
<P>On the 7th of March,<MILESTONE N="March" UNIT="month"> <MILESTONE N="Sunday 7" UNIT="day"> we made the We&s;tern I&s;lands, and went between Saint Michael and Tercera; in this &s;ituation we found the variation 13&deg; 36&prime; W. and the winds began to blow from the S.W. The gale, as we got farther to the we&s;tward,<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 11" UNIT="day"> increa&s;ed, and on the 11th, having got to W.N.W. it blew very hard, with a great &s;ea; we &s;cudded before it with the fore&s;ail only, the foot rope of which &s;uddenly breaking, the &s;ail blew all to pieces, before we could get the yard down, though it was done in&s;tantly. This obliged us to bring the &s;hip to, but having, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, bent a new fore&s;ail, and got the yard up, we bore away again; this was the la&s;t accident that happened to us during the voyage.<MILESTONE N="Tue&s;day 16" UNIT="day"> On the 16th, being in latitude 49&deg; 15&prime; N. we got foundings.<MILESTONE N="Thur&s;day 18" UNIT="day"> On the 18th, I knew by the depth of water that we were in the Channel, but the wind being to the northward,<MILESTONE N="Friday 19" UNIT="day"> we could not make land till the next day, when we &s;aw the Start Point; <MILESTONE N="Saturday 20" UNIT="day"> and on the 20th, to our great joy, we anchored at Spithead, after a very fine pa&s;&s;age, and a fair wind all the way from the Gape of Good Hope.</P>
