<HEAD>LETTER I. FROM MRS. AUDLEY TO LUCY.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;orry you have been &s;o alarmed for the dear bachelor; and give you both joy and prai&s;e, my good girl, for having nur&s;ed him once more into his u&s;ual &s;aucy health. Behold us all hap|pily arrived at Audley-Grove, where the gay Loui&s;a was ready and delighted to receive us. She is wonderfully improved, &s;ince we &s;aw her la&s;t, in &s;tature, beauty, and &s;en&s;e&mdash;but more of her in her turn; I have a thou&s;and things to talk of fir&s;t. I &s;hall not wa&s;te my paper in tel|ling you what a fine numerous cavalcade we formed in returning hither, nor what a graceful figure our lovely widow made on her beautiful Portugueze palfrey. No, my dear, not a word of all this. I mu&s;t begin like a true mother, by
<PB N="2" REF="4">
talking of my chits, and telling you, that your little name&s;ake, and Charles, and William, are all highly plea&s;ed, as we are, with the Mon&s;ons, our new governor and governe&s;s, who came hither in our party, and are very &s;oon to be &s;ettled in the white farm-hou&s;e lately inclo&s;ed within the park, where the little folks under their care are to re&s;ide. But methinks I hear you cry, Pi&s;h! why does &s;he begin talk|ing to me of the brats, who are all well, when I am dying to hear of the poor Cornelia, who is "perplexed in the extreme?"</P>
<P>Would I could &s;ay that our gentle friend en|joys, as our a&s;&s;ociated children do (for her little ones are here),
<Q><L>The thoughtle&s;s day, the ea&s;y night,</L>
<L>The &s;pirits pure, the &s;lumbers light!</L></Q></P>
<P>But, alas! I perceive too clearly, that her tender bo&s;om is becoming the victim of "the fury-pa&s;&s;ions." I may with too much propriety &s;peak of them in the plural number; for, by a little incident which I will tell you pre&s;ently, you will find that &s;he is tormented by more than one; and that Jealou&s;y has added new &s;tings to di&s;contented and &s;elf tormenting Love. I &s;ee, my dear Lucy, that you begin to form a hun|dred &s;urmi&s;es, and want to a&s;k me a hundred que&s;tions. What! (I hear you exclaim) is the romantic Seymour &s;o fickle? Is he really cap|tivated by the girli&s;h bloom of Loui&s;a? Patience my good girl; it is not fair, when you get a new play in your hand, to peep at the la&s;t act before you have well fini&s;hed the fir&s;t. Allow me to proceed in my own way, and I will &s;oon
<PB N="3" REF="5">
make you better acquainted with all the charac|ters and conduct of our bu&s;y drama: which is to end, I hope, according to the good old e&s;tab|li&s;hed cu&s;tom, with a happy marriage.&mdash;Fir&s;t then for our heroine, our dear Cornelia: there is an air of deep dejection fixing it&s;elf on her features (in &s;pite of all our attempts to di&s;per&s;e it) which alarms me much. She is even me|lancholy in the pre&s;ence of Seymour; and much more &s;o when he is out of her &s;ight: yet &s;he has &s;uch a dread of pa&s;&s;ing a few minutes alone with him, that &s;he conjures me to watch over her ince&s;&s;antly, and never allow him an oppor|tunity of &s;peaking to her in private. But my good man, though he has not made him a con|vert, as I mo&s;t devoutly hoped he would, has yet made him &s;o tractable, and &s;o willing to be&s;tow a religious education on the children that Cornelia has, and may have, that I am in great hopes their de&s;irable union may, in due time, be happily accompli&s;hed, in &s;pite of the dear ra&s;h creature's too righteous vow on the fatal night that I de&s;cribed to you. This cruel vow pre&s;&s;es like an engine of torture on her heart. She frequently &s;ays to me, that their marriage mu&s;t never take place; but &s;he &s;ays this with &s;uch a voice, and &s;uch a countenance, as convince me that, if it does not, her health and peace are utterly ruined for ever. I have not mentioned a word of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing vow to Seymour; and indeed I would not have him know of it for the world, e&s;pecially ju&s;t now, when I have brought his turbulent &s;pirits to a mo&s;t comfortable calm. I flatter my&s;elf that I am his favourite confidante; and, by telling him no more than literal truth on the various little
<PB N="4" REF="6">
proofs of Cornelia's entire affection for him, I have brought him to make me a promi&s;e very e&s;&s;ential to our pre&s;ent tranquillity; and this is, not to addre&s;s a &s;yllable concerning marriage to her, till the year of her widowhood is expired. In the mean time, it will be the great object of us all to calm her agitated &s;pirits by every thing that can divert and amu&s;e her. I was in great hopes that my lively niece Loui&s;a might be of great u&s;e to us in this friendly purpo&s;e! but, alas! how frequently does pain flow from tho&s;e &s;ources whence we expect only plea&s;ure! Now, Lucy, you &s;hall have the incident I pro|mi&s;ed; but fir&s;t I mu&s;t give you a little de&s;cripti|on of the charming girl, whom you have not &s;een &s;ince &s;he was a mere child. Though &s;he was always a beautiful child, &s;he has now, I think, &s;till more beauty than her infancy pro|mi&s;ed, and will, I pre&s;ume, be reckoned much hand&s;omer than our admired Cornelia her&s;elf, by all men who prefer a lively countenance to a tender one. They are exactly of the &s;ame height; and Loui&s;a, with the elegant &s;hape of our friend, has a &s;miling &s;et of features, that &s;eem to &s;ay there is no &s;uch thing as &s;orrow in the world. Happily, indeed, it has hitherto been as much a &s;tranger to her as if it did not exi&s;t; and as to the &s;olicitudes of Love, you will gue&s;s what experience &s;he has of them, when I tell you &s;he has yet found them only fit &s;ubjects for laughter.</P>
<P>I never &s;ee our tender widow and this &s;pright|ly girl together, but I have the two following lines of Shak&s;peare at the end of my tongue:
<PB N="5" REF="7">
though I mu&s;t confe&s;s my application of them appears rather cruel,
<Q><L>Why let the &s;tricken deer go weep,</L>
<L>The hart ungall'd may play.</L></Q></P>
<P>To play, indeed, from morning to night &s;eems the ruling propen&s;ity of Loui&s;a. Be&s;ides &s;inging &s;prightly &s;ongs with great humour and plea&s;antry, this laughter-loving gyp&s;ey is a mo&s;t admirable mimic. She half-delighted and half-provoked me and Caroline ye&s;terday, by taking off what &s;he calls the impa&s;&s;ioned langour of the widow and the &s;olemn &s;ympathy of Seymour: &s;he is, however, much too delicate and well-bred to attempt any thing of this kind in the pre|&s;ence of Cornelia; but when my hu&s;band and Seymour have got the &s;aucy arch girl to them|&s;elves, &s;he does not &s;pare the inamorato, as I learn from a &s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday in the garden, and produced a very &s;ingular effect with|in doors, though at the moment it e&s;caped my ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>It happened that I and Caroline (I cannot yet familiarize my&s;elf to the formal &s;ound of Mrs. Mon&s;on) were &s;tanding to chat with Cor|nelia at her toilet. The windows of her dre&s;&s;|ing-room, you know, have a perfect command of the new terrace where Loui&s;a, I find was &s;auntering, in one of her gaye&s;t moods, between the two gentlemen. As I chanced to turn my back to the window, I had not perceived the party in the garden, and had indeed my eyes and attention fully engaged by the features and dre&s;s of our lovely friend; who, between our|&s;elves, appears to me a little more curious in
<PB N="6" REF="8">
&s;etting her cap than &s;he u&s;ed to be before the ar|rival of my niece. She had borrowed Caroline's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to adju&s;t &s;ome feathers after the Spa|ni&s;h fa&s;hion; and, while they were both thus en|gaged, I was &s;uddenly alarmed by &s;eeing Cor|nelia turn as pale as death; a cold trembling &s;eized her whole frame, and all the loveline&s;s of her &s;weet countenance was lo&s;t in a &s;trange ex|pre&s;&s;ion of de&s;ponding wretchedne&s;s, or rather of lifele&s;s vacancy. Not &s;u&s;pecting the real &s;ource of her di&s;order, and apprehen&s;ive that &s;he was on the point of falling into a fainting fit from mere weakne&s;s of body, I led her to the &s;opha, and was very bu&s;y with my bottle of hart&s;horn. The moment I had placed her in a po&s;ture of ea&s;e and quiet, &s;he was relieved by a violent bur&s;t of tears; and pre&s;&s;ing my hand, &s;he &s;aid, in a broken voice, "Be not &s;o terrifi|ed, my dear Harriot: I have no malady to &s;truggle with, but my own folly; and I &s;hall &s;ubdue that pre&s;ently, if you and Caroline will have the goodne&s;s to leave me for a few mi|nutes alone." Unwilling as I was to quit her, I did not he&s;itate to comply with her reque&s;t, becau&s;e I perceived, by the looks of Caroline, that &s;he had &s;ome thoughts on the occa&s;ion that &s;he wi&s;hed to communicate in private.&mdash; We accordingly withdrew together; and the moment we got into my room, "For Heaven's &s;ake, my dear Caroline, &s;aid I, can you account for all this?" "Oh, Madam, replied the warm-hearted and grateful Caroline, &s;he mu&s;t, indeed &s;he mu&s;t, be the wife of Mr. Seymour; pray do not let Mr. Audley oppo&s;e it; I would venture my life on their being happy together. Though Mr. Seymour it not quite &s;o devout as
<PB N="7" REF="9">
he &s;hould be, yet he has a thou&s;and noble vir|tues; and &s;he loves him to di&s;traction." "I think with you entirely, my dear Caroline, I replied; but this is no an&s;wer to my que&s;tion: I thought by your manner that you had di&s;co|vered the immediate cau&s;e of my poor friend's agitation." "Di&s;covered it! cried Caroline, Ah, Madam, you would have &s;een it plain e|nough, if you had ca&s;t an eye towards the win|dow at the moment that Mrs. Sedley and I hap|pened to do &s;o. Poor lady! &s;he is far gone in|deed; but, I believe, in her ca&s;e I &s;hould have been affected as much." "Affected at what! dear Caroline, don't torture my curio&s;ity &s;o bar|barou&s;ly. For heaven's &s;ake what did you &s;ee?" "Nothing, madam, but an idle frolic of Mr. Seymour with Mi&s;s Loui&s;a. She had provoked him, I &s;uppo&s;e, by mimicking the poor lady who doats on him; how that might be I can't tell; but ju&s;t as Mrs. Sedley turned &s;o &s;ick, I happened to &s;py Mr. Seymour catching hold of Mi&s;s Loui&s;a, who had tried to run from him, and ki&s;&s;ing her mo&s;t unmercifully." "Poor Cornelia! I exclaimed with a &s;igh, can a &s;ight like this affect thee &s;o woefully! Well, my good Caroline, I continued, pray do not men|tion a &s;yllable of this idle affair to any crea|ture except your hu&s;band. I will in&s;tantly re|turn to my poor friend, and &s;ee if &s;he has ho|ne&s;ty, or rather &s;trength enough, to avow to me of her own accord the real cau&s;e of her &s;uffering." I found Cornelia greatly recovered, yet &s;o anxi|ous to evade all di&s;cour&s;e that might lead to an explanation of what had pa&s;&s;ed, that from a &s;in|cere de&s;ire not to di&s;tre&s;s her tender &s;pirits, I &s;a|crificed my de&s;ign of leading her to a full confe&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="8" REF="10">
Yet, to &s;hew to what an uncommon degree of amiable ingenuou&s;ne&s;s reigns in the heart of this admirable creature, I mu&s;t tell you how &s;he behaved to me on our retiring at night: &s;he took me to her own chamber, and &s;ending away her &s;ervant, began to apologize for her re&s;erve to|wards me before dinner. "I feel that I am guilty of ingratitude, my dear Harriot, &s;aid this tendere&s;t of friends, in attempting to con|ceal any exce&s;&s;es of my folly from you, who&s;e indulgence, and who&s;e zeal to comfort me, have ever kept pace with my haple&s;s propen&s;ity to torment my&s;elf. To-day, indeed, I was a&s;hamed to confe&s;s my extreme weakne&s;s to you in the moment; perhaps our gentle Caroline, who perceived it all, though &s;he was too delicate to utter a &s;yllable before me that proved her con|&s;cious of my folly, perhaps Caroline has explain|ed to you all the my&s;tery of my fooli&s;h agitation. Ah! my too indulgent Harriot, to what an ex|travagant and &s;illy pitch of fondne&s;s have you rai&s;ed my dangerous partiality for a man to whom I mu&s;t never be united! My rea&s;on tells me &s;ufficiently that I have no right to be jealous of him; yet I cannot behold him care&s;&s;|ing even your niece Loui&s;a, in a romping fro|lic, without &s;uch wretched and unju&s;tifiable &s;en|&s;ations as I am ready to dete&s;t, and de&s;pi&s;e my own heart for feeling. I did not think that any human bo&s;om could be &s;o very weak and unju&s;t; and much le&s;s did I &s;u&s;pect my&s;elf to be capa|ble of the extreme weakne&s;s and inju&s;tice which I am now deploring; but &s;ince it is &s;o, my dear Harriot, pray contrive for me to make a decent retreat to-morrow to my own quiet man&s;ion; and in&s;tead of encouraging"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">I heard the tender &s;oul with the mo&s;t patient &s;ilence thus far; but here I could not refrain from entering into a very warm oppo&s;ition, both to her &s;entiments and her project of retiring from our party. We had a curious di&s;&s;ertation on the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y, in which I affirmed, that a woman never feels it &s;o painfully, as when &s;he fancies &s;he has no right to feel it at all. We ran over all the old and new ground of argument for and again&s;t Seymour; in &s;hort, we &s;pent half the night in a very diver|&s;ified conver&s;ation, during which I laughed and wept, and &s;colded and &s;oothed our dear &s;elf-torturing friend alternately, till at la&s;t I left her a little reconciled both to her&s;elf and her lover. In wi&s;hing her a good night I added a &s;aucy declaration, that I &s;hould act as queen in my own ca&s;tle; that if &s;he talked again of re|moving, I &s;hould i&s;&s;ue an order for her clo&s;e confinement; and publi&s;h an edict at the &s;ame time, in which Seymour &s;hould be threatened with in&s;tant death if he was &s;een to touch any lips but her own.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Lucy, by a mixture of &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s and &s;port, I endeavour to pre&s;erve the mind of our gentle friend from pur&s;uing any immediate and de&s;perate re&s;olution that might prove fatal to her future peace. Would to Hea|ven I could as ea&s;ily remove Seymour's di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing infidelity in religion as I can annihilate the vehement re&s;olves which poor Cornelia will &s;ometimes utter of renouncing his &s;ociety for ever! My hu&s;band encourages me to hope that time may do much in promoting the happine&s;s of this intere&s;ting couple, if we can but prevent the eagerne&s;s of Love on one &s;ide, and of Fear
<PB N="10" REF="12">
on the other, from taking any precipi|tate mea&s;ures to accelerate or preclude their union. He wi&s;hes to keep them for a few months in an ab&s;olute neutrality. But this is a project which even his friendly zeal, and his per&s;ua&s;ive addre&s;s, will hardly be able to accom|pli&s;h. We cannot utterly change the di&s;po&s;i|tions of Nature. Love, in a bo&s;om like Sey|mour's, will be impetuous; and Terror, in a frame like Cornelia's, will be precipitate. For my part, I &s;hould not be &s;urprized if our dear con&s;cientious friend &s;hould be terrified &s;till more than &s;he is, by a vi&s;ion of the poor departed Sed|ley, and &s;hould &s;teal away from us in the night. The conflict of the various pa&s;&s;ions that agitate her mind is truly pitiable; and at the very mo|ment when I attempt to relieve her by laughing at her perplexities, my heart inwardly bleeds for the angui&s;h of hers. Yet perhaps &s;he &s;ays truly, my dear Lucy, that you, from the pecu|liar incidents of your pa&s;t life, are more able to enter into her pre&s;ent feelings than I am. From this idea &s;he will have great &s;atisfaction in un|burthening her full &s;oul to you; and as you will certainly have a letter from her very &s;oon, you will the more readily allow me to clo&s;e this long pacquet. Pray tell our dear Edmund that we think a change of air would have &s;ecured him from a relap&s;e, and that we wi&s;h him to take that precaution again&s;t a &s;econd. Cannot you make it &s;uit you both to come to us at this critical time; when the &s;age Edmund might prove a very u&s;eful Mentor to our young Tele|machus, not in driving him away from the en|joyments of Love, but in teaching him how to &s;ecure them? If, however, we mu&s;t not ex|pect
<PB N="11" REF="13">
the plea&s;ure of adding you to our party, as I fear we mu&s;t not; be a&s;&s;ured that I &s;hall &s;end you quick tidings of every intere&s;ting occur|rence relative to the great object of our general &s;olicitude.

<HEAD>LETTER II. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>IF you wi&s;h, my dear Edmund, to be plea|&s;antly laughed out of all the &s;ingularities belong|ing to the condition of a confirmed bachelor, aye, and out of the condition it&s;elf, let me ad|vi&s;e you to ha&s;ten hither. Here have we a pretty madcap from Ireland, who&s;e magical powers are &s;trong enough, I believe, to meta|morpho&s;e the &s;tiffe&s;t advocate for a &s;ingle life
<PB N="12" REF="14">
into the &s;upple&s;t of all &s;upple creatures, an uxo|rious and contented hu&s;band. In &s;erious truth, our young Loui&s;a is a mo&s;t lovely girl, and play|ful as the air which &s;ports with every feather that flies acro&s;s it. How it would delight me to &s;ee our dear di&s;creet Edmond mo&s;t profound|ly in love with this &s;weet &s;portive dam&s;el! By Heaven, &s;he has all the vivacity and frolic of your Sylvia, with good-nature and innocence into the bargain. She is the riche&s;t anti|dote that Nature can furni&s;h you with again&s;t tho&s;e poi&s;onous vapours of &s;pleen and timidity which you &s;ometimes feel and lament, and which &s;eldom fail, I believe, to infe&s;t the &s;ingle in the latter &s;tages of life. She is the very thing for you; perfectly qualified, though a child of Nature, to reli&s;h your wit, and to repay you for it, by a lighter and more copious coin of her own. Why, man, &s;he would de|&s;troy all your trouble&s;ome doubts, &s;cruples, and depre&s;&s;ions, as St. Patrick de&s;troyed the rats of her country by rhyming them to death. She will &s;pout you ver&s;es like a young prie&s;te&s;s of Apollo; yet the lovely creature has not an atom of pedantry or affectation about her; &s;he has, however, the dangerous diverting talent of mi|mickry to perfection. If my love to Cornelia had not been thoroughly rooted in my heart, I believe this gay gyp&s;ey would have beat it out of my bo&s;om, by the mere force of her wit and humour. She took me off, the other day, as we were &s;trolling, with only your brother, in the garden, with &s;uch provoking powers of ri|dicule, that, having little to &s;ay in my defence, I was forced to take vengeance on her lips. I believe &s;he will not &s;peedily renew the provoca|tion; for, &s;eizing her with all my force, I not
<PB N="13" REF="15">
only ki&s;&s;ed her without mercy, but refu&s;ed to relea&s;e her till &s;he, in her turn, be&s;towed a few ki&s;&s;es on me; and the warm luxuriant crea|ture
<Q><L>Did it with a prudency &s;o ro&s;y, the &s;weet view on't</L>
<L>Might well have warm'd old Saturn.</L></Q></P>
<P>"The&s;e are dangerous frolicks, Seymour, very dangerous indeed." This, I know, will be the exclamation of my dear timid monitor in peru&s;ing this little anecdote; and dangerous, I grant you, my good man of caution, &s;uch a frolic might be, had your &s;erious wor&s;hip been in my place. Had your &s;olidity ventured &s;o near as I did to this flaming beauty, I am con|fident &s;he would have &s;et you in a blaze; but I bear a charmed heart. The image of my lovely widow is &s;o magically engraven there, that no other enchantre&s;s has power to affect it. As to that danger which you, in the friendly abun|dance of your fears, have apprehended for the dam&s;el her&s;elf, believe me, &s;he is perfectly &s;e|cure. Loui&s;a is one of tho&s;e happy girls who&s;e &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit enable them to je&s;t, and even to romp, without endangering the freedom of their affections, and the delicacy of their cha|racter; or, as you will &s;ay of her when you are as much in love with this lively charmer as I wi&s;h you to be, &s;he is a Venus, who can &s;port with Momus, without forgetting that &s;he is the Queen of the Graces. And now, though you have not &s;een her, I under&s;tand, &s;ince &s;he was an infant, I &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l deem you a very barbarous fellow if you do not in&s;tantly fall in love with her upon my &s;ugge&s;tion; e&s;pecially as I have actually opened the campaign as your aid-du|camp,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
and have laid &s;trong &s;iege to her heart in your name: I may venture to add, that I have made con&s;iderable advances in this exploit; &s;o pray hear what they are. Fir&s;t, I have made her intimately acquainted with all your virtues, talents, and perfections; but this is the lea&s;t important part of my &s;ervice; my capital &s;troke in your favour is the following. Secondly, I have made her equally acquainted with your oddities and foibles. A pretty method (you will &s;ay) of &s;erving a friend. But hear me out, Edmund. In making her thus intimately ac|quainted with your oddities and foibles, I have &s;hewn her, at the &s;ame time, how exactly &s;uit|ed her own charms and accompli&s;hments are to correct, improve, and make you a perfect crea|ture. This I have done for you, my dear diffi|dent philo&s;opher; and I defy you, after all your profound meditations on the virtues and ca|prices of the fair &s;ex, to point out to me any conduct by which I could more effectually create for you a tender intere&s;t in the bo&s;om of the lady. Though you are often a champion for the fair, I believe in your private thoughts you do not think &s;o highly of women as I do. For my own part, I am per&s;uaded that a young, artle&s;s, &s;en&s;ible, inexperienced woman, is ge|nerally actuated by a &s;incere and ardent de&s;ire to make her own tender virtues of real utility to the world. This, by the way, will explain the rea&s;on why &s;o many of this de&s;cription have married in the hope of reforming a rake. It is not, as the vulgar phra&s;e will have it, that wo|men love to &s;ee a &s;pice of the devil in man, or that they have a vain confidence in their own per&s;onal attractions; no, it is becau&s;e nothing is &s;o bewitching to a virtuous mind without ex|perience,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
as the expectation of rendering its own virtue an in&s;trument of good.</P>
<P>But what a &s;ad pedantic varlet am I growing, to run on in this fine moral di&s;&s;ertation upon you and your laughing Loui&s;a (for &s;he mu&s;t be yours), without be&s;towing a &s;yllable on my pale, pen&s;ive, perplexed, yet adorable and faithfully adored Cornelia! But here comes my younge&s;t female monitor, my little Mentor in petticoats, the grateful Caroline; who has ju&s;t entered my room to fulfil her promi&s;e of indulg|ing me in a long private conference, in which I have a million of que&s;tions to a&s;k. By the arch &s;mile on her countenance &s;he has &s;ome plea&s;ant tidings to give me concerning my idol; but, as &s;he tells me the courier of the hou&s;e is waiting for this letter, I mu&s;t re&s;erve her good news to enliven my next. At pre&s;ent you have food enough for your imagination and your heart, in what I have &s;aid of Loui&s;a.&mdash;So good dige&s;tion wait on appetite, and health on both!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. FROM CORNELIA TO LUCY AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is from you alone, my dear Lucy, that I can expect perfect &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion for the various agitations of heart and mind which I continually endure. Though our ex|cellent Harriot has certainly one of the tendere&s;t hearts in the world, and is all kindne&s;s to me; yet having known, in her own happy lot, no|thing but the felicity of a mo&s;t fortunate affec|tion, &s;he cannot thoroughly enter into all the diver&s;ified wretchedne&s;s ari&s;ing from a pa&s;&s;ion that we can neither renounce nor &s;ubdue. You, my dear girl, have pa&s;&s;ed through the fiery or|deal, which is now con&s;uming my peace, and perhaps &s;ome portion of my integrity; for I fear I am acting very wrong, in &s;pite of all that our too indulgent Harriot alledges in my de|fence, to remain here in the &s;ociety of a fa&s;ci|nating creature, from whom I ought, I think, both for his &s;ake and my own, to hide my&s;elf for ever. But I will unburthen my full bo&s;om to you, my dear Lucy, and lay my whole &s;oul before you, in the hope that your experience, as well as your tenderne&s;s, may mini&s;ter in &s;ome degree to my relief.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">You have known, my good girl, what it is to love in &s;pite of rea&s;on, and without a hope of being united to the object of your regard. Ah, my dear Lucy, how &s;incerely do I admire that noblene&s;s of &s;pirit with which you have finally triumphed over feelings that &s;eem to annihilate the be&s;t faculties of the mind! But your can|dour will allow that you had one great advan|tage which I am very far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing: in di&s;covering the ba&s;ene&s;s of the man who had artfully engaged your affections, you had an op|portunity of &s;ummoning your pride to your &s;upport:
<Q>Your bane and antidote were both before you.</Q></P>
<P>But, alas, the ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e with me! "The gallant, the princely Seymour," to give him the titles conferred on him by your&s;elf, has, I find, no qualities (as you have often told me when arguing in his favour) "to awaken either contempt or indifference; and to love him once, is to love him for ever." How often, my dear friend, has that forcible expre&s;&s;ion of yours recur|red upon my heart! and how many wonderful occurrences, &s;ince you and I parted, have con|&s;pired to make me feel the truth of it as I do at this moment; but, while I am thoroughly convinced that my affection for him is become a part of my exi&s;tence, I feel with equal convic|tion the cruel nece&s;&s;ity if rejecting him as a hu&s;|band. Why am I here then in his company? Why do I linger thus, like a guilty gho&s;t, in a &s;cene that I ought and wi&s;h to abandon? Ah, my dear Lucy, if you could &s;ee how pale and thin your poor Cornelia is grown, you would not think the word <HI>gho&s;t</HI> mi&s;applied; and that I
<PB N="18" REF="20">
am in &s;ome degree guilty, my con&s;cience tells me every hour; for, by &s;taying here, I &s;eem to practi&s;e an ungenerous deceit towards Seymour, and may lead him perhaps to cheri&s;h a di&s;tant hope of accompli&s;hing what never mu&s;t come to pa&s;s. Why, then, do I &s;tay? Why, truly, becau&s;e your good brother and &s;i&s;ter will have it &s;o. They would per&s;uade me, that time may do wonders in removing the great and only ob|&s;tacle to this much-de&s;ired, yet impo&s;&s;ible, union. Your brother, this very morning, re|fu&s;ed to hear a petition that I attempted to make to him, for leave to depart; and turned from me, with the following parody on a couplet of Gray's:
<Q><L>Love yet may make an unbeliever wife,</L>
<L>And go&s;pel-light dawn from Cornelia's eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>Ah, my dear Lucy, I will confe&s;s to you there are times when this tran&s;porting idea takes full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul. When I fond|ly imagine my&s;elf de&s;tined by Heaven to re&s;cue the generous Seymour from the vain illu&s;ions and arrogant &s;ophi&s;try of the world, and to make him a true &s;ervant of that Divine Ma&s;ter who&s;e laws are &s;o con&s;onant to the purity and the benevolence of his heart, how exqui&s;ite is the delight of this heavenly idea! With what enthu&s;ia&s;tic tran&s;port have I frequently in my own mind applied to Seymour and my&s;elf the following charming lines from the Royal Con|vert of Rowe:
<Q><L>My Life! my Lord!</L>
<L>What would my heart &s;ay to thee?</L>
<L>Oh, lift thy eyes up to that holy Power</L>
<L>Who&s;e wondrous truths and Maje&s;ty divine</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21">Thy Ethelinda taught thee fir&s;t to know!</L>
<L>There &s;ix thy faith, and triumph o'er the world;</L>
<L>For who can help, or who can &s;ave be&s;ides?</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet, in &s;pite of this holy fortitude and fer|vor, which &s;eem in &s;ome or my private moments to render me a new and more exalted being, I &s;oon relap&s;e again into my poor trembling &s;elf. Though I feel, at times, as if I had &s;ufficient powers of language and rea&s;oning to produce a total and immediate change in the religious &s;en|timents of Seymour; and though I love him with &s;o pure and di&s;intere&s;ted a pa&s;&s;ion that I would mo&s;t willingly &s;acrifice my life to en&s;ure his conver&s;ion; yet &s;uch a poor, weak wretch am I, my dear Lucy, by nature, that I dare not even utter a &s;yllable to him on the &s;ubject of Religion; and a cold involuntary tremor runs through my whole frame, if the conver|&s;ation &s;eems to be taking that turn, whenever we are in company together. Still our dear encouraging Harriot would induce me to hope that the mild engaging piety of her hu&s;band, and his conciliating manners, united to the &s;ecret influence of Love, may gradually accom|pli&s;h what I have not faculties to attempt, and give to us at la&s;t the happy convert that we &s;o ardently wi&s;h to behold. "Why &s;hould we de&s;pair, &s;ays this indulgent friend and mo&s;t in|defatigable of advocates, why &s;hould we de&s;pair of &s;eeing a candid, a magnanimous young man relinqui&s;h the accidental prejudice of his youth? If Seymour were one of tho&s;e lawle&s;s libertines who abhor, in the Go&s;pel, an in&s;upportable curb to their &s;en&s;ual and imperious pa&s;&s;ions; or if he were one of tho&s;e cold-hearted and arro|gant
<PB N="20" REF="22">
&s;ophi&s;ts who decide every thing that does not &s;quare with their own infallible rea&s;on; we might indeed de&s;pair of his conver&s;ion. But Seymour is a character very different from the&s;e. In embracing the law of Chri&s;t, he will &s;ubject him&s;elf to no re&s;traint from which his heart can feel a wi&s;h to revolt: on the contrary, he will &s;ecure to him&s;elf, by this mea&s;ure, the only object of his pa&s;&s;ion to att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chment." Ah, my dear Lucy, you, I am &s;ure, will forgive me, for li&s;tening &s;ometimes with the fonde&s;t credulity to the&s;e in&s;inuating arguments. Alas! how deeply am I puni&s;hed for that credulity, when|ever my own poor wavering mind flies back again, as it frequently does, to the oppo&s;ite per|&s;ua&s;ion! I then think my&s;elf the mo&s;t culpable of creatures. I &s;eem to have de&s;erted my prime duty to my dear children, by &s;uffering my&s;elf to be thus more and more entangled in a con|nexion, which might ultimately lead me to vi|olate the dying injunction of their father, and expo&s;e them to the wor&s;t of evils. But no, my dear Lucy, this &s;hall never be. I have taken a mo&s;t &s;acred oath, as Harriot has told you, that I will never be the wife of an infidel. Seymour is too noble to delude me with hypocri&s;y; and whatever d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tiny may await me, I am &s;ecure again&s;t this deepe&s;t of calamities. Why, then, am I tormented with &s;uch a dread and horror of what never can befall me? For, O, my dear friend, I am tormented to a degree that I can hardly impart, without a &s;cruple, to your ten|der bo&s;om. I know how you will feel for me, when I tell you (what I have not confe&s;&s;ed to Harriot) that I am haunted by vi&s;ions which almo&s;t freeze my blood, and render me an ob|ject
<PB N="21" REF="23">
of dete&s;tation to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;elf. You will &s;uppo&s;e I am per&s;ecuted in my dreams by the image of the poor departed Sedley: but it is not &s;o; to my great &s;urpri&s;e, I have never dreamt of him in all my pre&s;ent agitation of &s;pirits. No; my vi&s;ions are much more horrid, for I have dream|ed that my exce&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion for Seymour had annihilated all my natural affection for my chil|dren. O GOD! my dear Lucy, this is a hor|ror of which you can form no adequate concep|tion. I had hardly clo&s;ed my eyes la&s;t night when I &s;eemed to behold the mi&s;ery of my alie|nated children. I heard William &s;hriek out, to the poor little affrighted Charles, "Our mother is turned into a treacherous friend!" Their looks of terror and abhorrence pierced me to the &s;oul. I &s;trove to convince them of my fondne&s;s; the poor bewildered innocents fled from me. I pur&s;ued them through innumera|ble difficulties; till at la&s;t I awoke in a bur&s;t of convul&s;ive angui&s;h, and found my&s;elf actually kneeling and weeping over the little bed in my chamber where the two dear boys were happily a&s;leep. At fir&s;t I could hardly believe my own happine&s;s, in finding them &s;o tranquil; and I took the light which I always burn in my room to convince my&s;elf of its truth, by a full &s;urvey of their &s;weet little placid features. The con|tra&s;t of their &s;oft delicious &s;lumber, and the ago|ny which I had dreamed they were &s;uffering, threw me into fre&s;h floods of tears. In retiring to my own pillow, I addre&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t ardent prayer to Heaven, not only to pre&s;erve the&s;e dear infants from all the evil which my weak|ne&s;s might draw upon them, but to deliver both my&s;elf and Seymour from this di&s;quieting pa&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="22" REF="24">
which &s;eems &s;o likely to prove a misfor|tune to both. I am afraid you will think me hardly &s;incere in this prayer; yet believe me, my dear friend, if I know my own heart and &s;oul, I was &s;o mo&s;t truly. But to you, my dear Lucy, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to confe&s;s, that the more I &s;truggle to free my&s;elf from this fa&s;cinat|ing attachment, the more I feel my&s;elf the &s;lave of an unfortunate affection, which has &s;o much to plead in its excu&s;e. My rea&s;on and my con|&s;cience continually &s;ugge&s;t to me that I am wrong; and there are times when I feel a &s;ort of hatred towards Seymour, for having led me to a &s;tate of mind &s;o full of pain and di&s;tre&s;s. Even in my private meditations my heart will often &s;eem to &s;hrink from him, and hold it as a crime even to think of his perfections. But the&s;e feelings are tran&s;ient; and they are generally followed by &s;uch a relap&s;e of tender pa&s;&s;ions, that I am ready to addre&s;s the image of this dear enemy to my peace in the words of Ethe|linda:
<Q><L>If thou art my offence, I've &s;inn'd indeed,</L>
<L>Ev'n to a va&s;t and numberle&s;s account;</L>
<L>For from the &s;ea&s;on when I lov'd thee fir&s;t</L>
<L>My &s;oul has not one moment been without thee.</L></Q></P>
<P>You, my dear friend, you and Harriot have been cruelly in&s;trumental to my di&s;quietude and di&s;tre&s;s, by your well-intended, but fatal indul|gence to me, at the early period of my attach|ment; when you ridiculed my hone&s;t endea|vours to conceal and &s;ubdue my affection, when you delighted to fan the flame that I was vainly labouring to extingui&s;h. Time and chance have con&s;pired &s;till more cruelly to give this
<PB N="23" REF="25">
mo&s;t enchanting of men a dominion over my heart. I have a &s;trange mixture of pain and delight in reflecting on the great obligation that I owe him. He has indeed, as you have often &s;aid of him, &s;o many attractive accom|pli&s;hments and virtues, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for any woman to &s;ee him frequently without feeling an affectionate admiration of his charac|ter. Surely no man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;o high a degree that rare union of tenderne&s;s and &s;pirit which is &s;o particularly engaging to our &s;ex, or &s;uch admirable delicacy of manners, without a &s;hadow of artifice or affectation. O Lucy, I could &s;cribble a volume on the excellence and peculiarity of his attractions; but though his perfections will more than ju&s;tify, my good girl, your ardent friend&s;hip for him, I feel that, great as they are, they cannot afford a &s;ufficient &s;anction to my love. It is enough that my con&s;cience repeatedly informs me I mu&s;t not in|dulge it. Con&s;cience, my good Lucy, is a much &s;afer guide than Friend&s;hip her&s;elf, however zealous and enlightened; and when we act a|gain&s;t the dictates of this internal monitor, e|ven in points that &s;eem hardly material, how deeply are we puni&s;hed! Alas, I am a &s;ad ex|ample how deeply I offended this inflexible judge, when I complied with the pre&s;&s;ing &s;oli|citations of our dear Harriot in attending her hither. What I have endured &s;ince I came under her friendly roof you may partly gue&s;s, from what I have told you already. But, alas! my dear Lucy, I have not yet told you all my weak|ne&s;&s;es or my &s;ufferings. You have probably heard what I allude to from our communica|tive Harriot, becau&s;e it was a weakne&s;s that I con|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="26">
to her, and confiding in your kindne&s;s and &s;ecrecy, I lay her under no re&s;traint in what &s;he &s;ays of me to you; yet her tenderne&s;s, perhaps, in this point, may have &s;pared me. I will there|fore be frank enough to tell you under my own hand, that I have within the&s;e few days been the weake&s;t and mo&s;t unju&s;t of women; I have been fool enough to grow mo&s;t ab&s;urdly jealous of him who&s;e addre&s;&s;es I had determined to re|ject. Oh, Lucy, I did not think there had been &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tency in woman; much le&s;s in my own heart. You, I know, will rather pity than ridicule me, when I tell you that up|on accidentally &s;eeing Seymour care&s;&s;ing our young Loui&s;a in a mere frolic, I felt as if my whole frame was &s;hattered on the rack. Of all the &s;en&s;ations that I remember to have endured in my life, this, my dear friend, was the mo&s;t hideou&s;ly painful; it &s;eemed as if my heart was ab&s;olutely torn away from its &s;eat, and there was nothing but drear vacuity in my bo&s;om. Heaven have mercy upon the jealous, if &s;uch are the tortures they endure! But my pain could not be owing to mere jealou&s;y; it was ra|ther the effect of a &s;udden &s;urprize, upon nerves that have been dreadfully &s;haken. I think I could &s;ee the &s;ame thing again without feeling any emotion at the &s;ight; yet I will not pre|tend to more fortitude, or more ju&s;tice, than I have. You have often very feelingly lament|ed your own weakne&s;s to me, my dear friend; and I am now abundantly returning your con|fidence. I have a double rea&s;on for thus un|folding to you every in&s;tance of my folly. Fir&s;t, as proof of my perfect regard for you. Second|ly, becau&s;e I hope, in thus &s;hewing how tho|roughly
<PB N="25" REF="27">
I am aware of my own infirmity, I may gain credit with you for the &s;trength and wi&s;dom that I mean to recover and exert. I have formed a plan, in my own mind, for my deliverance; upon which I am particularly &s;oli|citous to have your opinion, becau&s;e I think no one can enter into my feelings &s;o thoroughly as your&s;elf. Our dear Harriot, and her mo&s;t friendly hu&s;band, judge me too hardly, or ra|ther too tenderly. From their eager wi&s;h to exempt me from pain, they &s;uppo&s;e me unable to endure it; they both believe me &s;o incurably enamoured of Seymour, that they think no e|vent but our marriage can pre&s;erve my exi&s;t|ence; but, weak as I feel and confe&s;s my&s;elf to be, I have &s;till, I am convinced, a &s;trength of &s;pirit far &s;uperior to what they imagine. Our dear and zealous Harriot is &s;o vehement for this impo&s;&s;ible marriage, that &s;he wants me to overlook the grand and in&s;uperable objection. She tells me, that I ought to be &s;atisfied by &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions as Seymour, &s;he &s;ays, is very will|ing to make. That if I have the mo&s;t unque&s;ti|onable a&s;&s;urance that all my children &s;hall be re|ligiou&s;ly educated in the Chri&s;tian Faith, and my own principles unmole&s;ted by oppo&s;ition, I have no rea&s;on to di&s;turb my&s;elf concerning the private creed of my hu&s;band. But, &s;ituated as I am, I feel it is my prime duty to regard the dying injunction of poor Sedley, and to main|tain the voluntary oath which I was induced to take from an exce&s;s of anxiety for my children. I might indeed confide in any promi&s;e of Sey|mour's; for, &s;tranger as he mo&s;t unhappily is to the only true Religion, in all other points he is truth it&s;elf. If he gave his word to this arti|cle,
<PB N="26" REF="28">
I can believe that he never would urge a &s;ingle argument, or attempt by ridicule to &s;hake the faith of my children or of his own. But, if he did not poi&s;on their young minds by his doctrine, might he not mi&s;lead them by his in|&s;inuating example? Might he not induce even me to grow cold and negligent in the mo&s;t important duty of life, and to relinqui&s;h imper|ceptibly the wor&s;hip of my Redeemer? Yes, my dear friend, I will confe&s;s to you, that I could not promi&s;e for my own firmne&s;s, were I to place my&s;elf in &s;o perilous a &s;ituation; even now I often contemplate the irreligion of the man I love in too favourable a light.

mind &s;o effectually as I now hope to do, had not the forcible admonitions of my dear Har|riot's father awakened me to the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of my dangers and my duty. Good daughter as &s;he is, &s;he could hardly forgive him for his ve|hemence again&s;t Seymour, in that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed night of which &s;he &s;ays &s;he gave you a very mi|nute de&s;cription; yet he certainly acted only the part that became him, as a friend and a divine. The more I reflect on the many &s;trong and ju&s;t things he &s;aid, the more I feel my&s;elf indebted to his virtue, and the more I hope to profit by his advice; though, as I have already confe&s;&s;ed to you, there are times when it has not the &s;lighte&s;t influence on my feelings. In my more di&s;creet hours I endeavour to fortify my &s;pirit by calling his very powerful lecture to my mind. One of his remarks made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion upon me. In entering minutely in|to the character of Seymour, after doing full ju&s;tice to his courage, his genero&s;ity, and his engaging accompli&s;hments, he &s;aid, "I will grant you, that he is a mo&s;t delightful compa|nion for your &s;ex at his pre&s;ent period of life; there is a vivacity and good-nature in youth that can hide all the hideou&s;ne&s;s of impiety it|&s;elf; but the main que&s;tion is, what &s;ort of a hu&s;band will this man make towards the middle and latter end of his days, when his gaiety be|gins to langui&s;h, from the emptine&s;s of human plea&s;ures, and his lively temper is rendered more &s;plenetic and imperious by the inevitable vexations of the world? The&s;e are the trying &s;ea&s;ons of our exi&s;tence; and if he is de&s;titute of Religion, as we know but too well he is, believe me he is de&s;titute of every thing that
<PB N="28" REF="30">
can tranquillize his own &s;pirit at the period I am &s;peaking of, and enable him to diffu&s;e light and comfort to his dome&s;tic circle." I have given you, I believe, very near the exact words of my vehement and venerable coun&s;ellor; for, agitated as I was, every &s;yllable that he uttered &s;unk deep into my &s;oul; and as there is, you know, a &s;trange &s;pirit of contradiction in our nature, I believe I remember his expre&s;&s;ions the more accurately, becau&s;e the too indulgent Har|riot has wi&s;hed me to forget them: the la&s;t time that I recalled &s;ome of the&s;e to her recollection, &s;he was almo&s;t angry with me, and &s;aid, in her &s;pirited manner, that I &s;hould realize the &s;tory of the poor Lady Clementina, and drive my&s;elf quite out of my &s;en&s;es by my religious &s;cruples. But, as I told her in my reply our ca&s;es are widely different; that enchanting cha|racter, whether true or ideal, had many cir|cum&s;tances to di&s;tract her, from which I am happily exempt: &s;he was per&s;ecuted by proud and imperious relations; the little difference be|tween her own creed and that of Grandi&s;on was not &s;ufficiently vi&s;ible and weighty to make her mind clear and re&s;olute in her deci&s;ion again&s;t him. Alas! how different is my ca&s;e! I di&s;|tinctly &s;ee my own duty; and I tru&s;t I am now compleatly determined to fulfil it. I &s;hall, how|ever take a hint from the noble Clementina. I am &s;trongly inclined to &s;olicit the well-known genero&s;ity of my lover to &s;upport me again&s;t him&s;elf. This, my dear Lucy, is the plan upon which I am anxious for your opinion. Our dear Harriot has very innocently increa&s;ed my mi&s;ery, by her eagerne&s;s to relieve it; though I had not power to refu&s;e her pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="29" REF="31">
intreaties, I am now too painfully convinced, by my own &s;ufferings, that I ought not to have made one of the party here. My peace is fled, and my health is wa&s;ting rapidly away. I have no chance of recovering a tolerable degree of quiet, but in a re&s;olute and ha&s;ty retreat to my own &s;olitary man&s;ion. I mu&s;t take, however, my dear boys along with me; for all my force and fortitude originates in them. The Mon|&s;ons, I know, will follow me with their other little pupils. In the grateful and &s;en&s;ible Caro|line I have a valuable bo&s;om-friend, mo&s;t anxi|ous for my la&s;ting happine&s;s, though confe&s;&s;edly in the intere&s;t of her generous protector.</P>
<P>Our dear Harriot thinks me &s;o totally unfit to be my own guide, that I know &s;he would not patiently hear of this project, nece&s;&s;ary as I feel it is to my peace. I think, therefore, of accompli&s;hing my departure without her &s;u&s;|pecting it. All this I have &s;ettled in my own mind, and am much ea&s;ier &s;ince I formed the re&s;olution. But now, my dear &s;ympathetic friend, decide for me the great point that per|plexes me: &s;hall I, or &s;hall I not, leave a long letter for Seymour; unfolding mo&s;t frankly to him all the painful pa&s;t conflicts in my bo&s;om; and conjuring him, by the &s;incerity of that di&s;|intere&s;ted love which he profe&s;&s;es, to let me peaceably pur&s;ue the only line of conduct that can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ecure to me the la&s;ting approba|tion of my heart, and the tranquillity of my mind? I know, if I a&s;ked Harriot the que&s;tion that I have now propo&s;ed to you, my dear Lu|cy, &s;he would wickedly laugh in my face, and tell me, that the ardent imagination of Seymour would con&s;ider &s;uch an epi&s;tle as a delicate hint
<PB N="30" REF="32">
to pur&s;ue me to Sedley-hall. But our &s;prightly friend does not, I think, perfectly under&s;tand either Seymour or me. As to my&s;elf, I &s;hould a&s;&s;uredly wi&s;h to be under&s;tood as literally &s;in|cere in my reque&s;t; and I am willing to think that Seymour, with all his impetuous &s;pirit, has too much penetration, and too much delicacy, to put &s;o wrong a con&s;truction on the language of a woman, when &s;he candidly reveals her whole &s;oul to him without a &s;hadow of re&s;erve. But tell me what you think; and tell me &s;peedi|ly, my dear girl. Suppo&s;e your&s;elf exactly in my &s;ituation, and tell me how you would act: yet you cannot do &s;o completely; your imagi|nation, lively and powerful as it is, cannot perfectly &s;ugge&s;t to you all the &s;trong feelings of a mother &s;ituated as I am. But how many &s;triking circum&s;tances have I to impre&s;s upon my heart all the great duties of that important character! The extreme loveline&s;s of my chil|dren, the dying reque&s;t of my poor Sedley, the admonitions of my own excellent father, who, delighting in the uncommon name that he gave me, u&s;ed frequently to bid me remember that he gave it me, not becau&s;e it &s;ounded well, and was &s;ingular, but becau&s;e it had belonged to a Roman lady di&s;tingui&s;hed by the lu&s;tre of her maternal virtues, and becau&s;e he hoped that if Heaven ble&s;&s;ed me with children, it might make me as attentive as &s;he was to the care of their education. O you benevolent &s;pirits who were once on earth the kind monitors of your Cornelia, and are now perhaps looking down upon her from Heaven, I will not forget you, and the principles which you infu&s;ed into my

<HEAD>LETTER IV. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>IF I ever entru&s;t to any man, my dear Sey|mour, a commi&s;&s;ion to chu&s;e a wife for me, it &s;hall certainly be to you; for I know not in the world a man more entitled to the old cla&s;&s;ical compliment of <HI>"elegans formarum &s;pectator."</HI> You are indeed an accompli&s;hed judge, both of exterior and internal beauty; of the per&s;ons and
<PB N="33" REF="35">
the minds of women; but to chu&s;e a wife is an arduous bu&s;ine&s;s, where good luck, as well as good &s;en&s;e, is &s;o e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite, that, without doubting your di&s;cernment, I may di&s;|tru&s;t your fortune; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e, after making one choice for your&s;elf with con|&s;ummate &s;ucce&s;s (for no woman, in my opinion, can be more &s;uited to you than Cornelia), you cannot rea&s;onably expect a &s;econd in&s;tance of marvellous felicity in chu&s;ing for your friend. Did you ever hear of a lottery in which the two twenty thou&s;ands were &s;elected by one per&s;on? As to my&s;elf, I am, you know, &s;o far from be|ing &s;anguine in my expectations of all matters depending on chance, that I &s;hall probably pa&s;s through the world without once venturing on one of the&s;e richly promi&s;ing matrimonial tick|ets; yet, believe me, it is not becau&s;e I think le&s;s highly of the &s;ex than you do; no, indeed, after all that Wit and Satire have written again&s;t women and wedlock, I am convinced that life is hardly &s;upportable without &s;ome female con|nexion; and there is certainly no connexion &s;o likely to produce la&s;ting plea&s;ure and comfort as a marriage where Love may be con&s;idered as prime mini&s;ter, under the &s;overeign authority of Rea&s;on. But our lot, as to marriage or celi|bacy, is generally decided by &s;ome little inci|dent that &s;tarts up in the early part of life, and hurries us we know not whither. It was my de&s;tinity, as you are perfectly apprized, to be &s;trangely entangled in a tender attachment, that I could never entirely approve, that time and experience induce me &s;till more to condemn. and that I yet want the fortitude or the cruelty (call it which you will) to terminate in the
<PB N="34" REF="36">
manner that would be mo&s;t conducive to my quiet, my intere&s;t, and my reputation. Man is by nature &s;o &s;ubtile a logician in his own de|fence, that he is hardly ever without a very &s;pecious rea&s;on for &s;uch conduct as his private inclinations impel him to pur&s;ue. Thus I im|pute my celibacy not &s;olely to my &s;ecret bondage under the dominion of the too fond and way|ward Sylvia, but to circum&s;tances of a more honourable complexion. My good &s;i&s;ter Lucy &s;tands forth as the fair and o&s;ten&s;ible motive for my &s;ingle life. Indeed the bitter di&s;appoint|ment which this excellent girl met with in her matrimonial pro&s;pect, made me very de&s;irous of &s;ettling her where &s;he might at lea&s;t enjoy the authority of a wife. She has now pre&s;ided over my hou&s;e &s;o long, has "borne her faculties &s;o meekly, and been &s;o clear in her great office," that I am inclined to believe we are happier in thus mutually &s;upporting our liberties, than ei|ther of us would have been under matrimonial dominion.</P>
<P>This being the ea&s;e, you mu&s;t allow the con|firmed bachelor to remain in the quiet enjoy|ment of his various odities. I have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the period at which Ari&s;totle &s;ays the good citi|zen ought to marry; and &s;ince I have let the &s;ea&s;on &s;lip, I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with exhort|ing you to make ample amends for my omi&s;&s;ion. Do not, however, &s;uppo&s;e that I mean to throw a double duty upon you, or advi&s;e you to make love alternately to the virgin and the widow; which you &s;eem half inclined to do. Dangerous frolics indeed! Pray be a little more con&s;tant in your devoirs and a little more temperate in your revenge.&mdash;Heaven pre&s;erve your lively

<P>Ah, Seymour, you will find perhaps, when you are on the verge of forty, that you are a better judge of &s;uch di&s;parity.

<HEAD>LETTER V. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>IN clo&s;ing my la&s;t to you, my dear Edmund, I gave you rea&s;on to expect very &s;peedily &s;ome gay tidings in favour of my love, that were ju&s;t announced to me by the arch &s;mile of the good, grateful Caroline. That mo&s;t &s;incere and mo&s;t zealous friend to my pa&s;&s;ion had indeed &s;ome very delicious intelligence to give me; but the excellent creature was &s;o divided and confu&s;ed, between her ardent de&s;ire to &s;erve me, and her dread of betraying her patrone&s;s, that I had &s;ome difficulty in drawing from her lips what &s;he came on purpo&s;e to communicate. At length, however, my faithful mini&s;ter opened the bud|get, and pre&s;ented to me &s;uch a &s;tatement of af|fairs, that my heart bounded in my bo&s;om with vanity and joy. My grand wi&s;h is accom|pli&s;hed; my exqui&s;itely tender Cornelia is jea|lous of me to di&s;traction. She happened to &s;py me from her window, folding Loui&s;a in my arms, and almo&s;t fainted at the &s;ight. "If I do not take pity of her, as Benedick, &s;ays, I am a villain. If I do not love her, I am a Jew." I &s;hall not add, in the words of the play, "I will
<PB N="37" REF="39">
go get her picture;" but I will ha&s;ten to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enchanting original. Shake not thy head, my dear timorous monitor; and tell me no more of caution and delay. Shall I keep &s;uch endearing &s;en&s;ibility on the rack of her own affectionate doubts and fears! "Aye, but, Seymour, I hear you exclaim, remember the great impediment in your way; which only time and patience can enable you to o'erleap." Fear not, my good friend: I am not blind to all the ob&s;tacles before me; and have lately di&s;|covered one, of which my &s;agacious monitor him&s;elf, perhaps, is not aware. Your kind &s;i&s;|ter, Harriot, has not dealt quite &s;o frankly with me as &s;he profe&s;&s;es to do; but I &s;hall &s;hew her in my turn, that when I meet with re&s;erve and di&s;gui&s;e, I al&s;o can make my&s;teries of my own, and conceal from my intimate friends both what I know and what I intend. After the docility and obedience which I have &s;hewn to her man|dates, Harriot ought to have imparted to me a &s;ecret that I accidentally got a &s;u&s;picion of, and at la&s;t with great difficulty extorted from the hone&s;t bo&s;om of Caroline, who nobly cho&s;e rather to break a promi&s;e which &s;he had incon|&s;iderately made to Mrs. Audley, than appear barbarous and ungrateful to me. So the good creature reluctantly confe&s;&s;ed to me, that my dear idol has made a ha&s;ty and de&s;perate vow, you may gue&s;s of what nature. Pray ob&s;erve, that the &s;oft Cornelia can be precipitate as well as her lover. But what are vows, my dear timid preceptor? Do we not know, from the experi|ence of ages, that fond women make them as they make &s;ugar toys with concealed mottos, chiefly for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them broken.
<PB N="38" REF="40">
I have ju&s;t formed a glorious and delightful pro|ject for demoli&s;hing this pa&s;te-like but unpalata|ble vow of my lovely widow. As the &s;weet creature will &s;wear, I mu&s;t make her exchange her rough oath, for one of gentler form. Be not terrified at this intimation, my good cheri&s;h|er of unnece&s;&s;ary apprehen&s;ions; I am not go|ing to play the terrific Jupiter, in all his fire, with this fond jealous Semele, and reduce the tender creature to a&s;hes; though &s;he &s;eems by her provoking vow to invite all my powers. I will not explain to you what my project is, be|cau&s;e I know there is a tardy caution and timi|dity in your nature that would not allow you to approve it. Re&s;t however a&s;&s;ured, that there is nothing di&s;honourable, nothing ungentle, in the &s;cheme. Trouble not your&s;elf to &s;end me any wi&s;e remon&s;trances; for if you do I can only an&s;wer them thus,

<HEAD>LETTER VI. FROM LUCY AUDLEY TO CORNELIA.</HEAD>
<P>YOU do me ju&s;tice, my very dear friend, in giving me credit for the mo&s;t perfect &s;ympathy in all you endure. Indeed, I &s;ympathize with you &s;o entirely, that my &s;entiments and wi&s;hes &s;eem to follow every variation of yours; and the little judgment that Nature gave me is re|duced, I fear, to an ab&s;olute nothing, by the exce&s;s of my anxiety for your very delicate and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation. I feel at once flattered, delighted, grieved, perplexed, and overwhelm|ed, by your mo&s;t friendly and endearing letter; for, to imitate your charming frankne&s;s, I
<PB N="40" REF="42">
mu&s;t tell you that I feel my&s;elf utterly unwor|thy to &s;u&s;tain the part of your advi&s;er and your guide, which, in your kind partiality, you &s;eem to wi&s;h me to a&s;&s;ume. You pay me a mo&s;t ani|mating compliment on the triumph that I gain|ed over my own unfortunate and ill-placed affec|tion. But what, my &s;weet friend, what was my trial, compared to yours? To alienate a fond and &s;imple heart from a man whole ba&s;e character had been publickly detected, and who clearly de&s;erved general contempt, requires, I own, &s;ome painful efforts; but &s;uch efforts few women, I believe, would fail to make with &s;ucce&s;s; becau&s;e, as you ju&s;tly remark, our Pride in &s;uch a conflict affords a very powerful &s;upport to our Rea&s;on. But to relinqui&s;h the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, the mo&s;t admired, the mo&s;t engaging of men; to relinqui&s;h &s;uch a being, when you know he doats on you with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate attachment, and when he has awak|ened all the feelings of reciprocal affection; to relinqui&s;h him for one unhappy circum&s;tance, which is rather his misfortune than his fault; to re&s;olve and to pre&s;evere in all this, may per|haps be within the power of our angelic Cornelia. I &s;hall be ready to adore you, if you make the &s;acrifice; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s that the poor mor|tal Lucy would hardly be able to purcha&s;e Hea|ven it&s;elf at &s;uch a price. Do not abhor me as an impious creature, my dear devout friend, for this confe&s;&s;ion. Believe me, though I am a very weak, yet I am &s;till a very &s;incere Chri&s;|tian; but I am convinced that our feeble brains may think even of Religion too much; and as
<PB N="41" REF="43">
a poet, who was very far from wanting piety, has very happily told us,
<Q>The wor&s;t of madmen is a &s;aint run mad.</Q></P>
<P>Do not imagine that I think the religious faith of a hu&s;band is a matter of little con&s;e|quence to a wife: on the contrary, in a con|nexion where unexpected di&s;cord is &s;o apt to a|ri&s;e, I think the two minds &s;hould be as nearly in uni&s;on as po&s;&s;ible, upon all the great objects of human contemplation. But where, my dear friend, is &s;uch complete uni&s;on to be found? Perhaps not upon earth. Marriage would be a rare thing indeed if it were never to be &s;olem|nized till &s;uch uni&s;on could be proved. It is the fa&s;hion therefore, in this nece&s;&s;ary and univer|&s;al ceremony, to take a great deal upon tru&s;t: and many a good wife, if &s;he &s;ees her hu&s;band go decently to church, troubles her head very little concerning his private notions either of GOD or the Devil. Our ladies indeed, in for|mer times, were more piou&s;ly inqui&s;itive. I have read, I think in Hudibras, of certain de|vout dames of quality, who tied their hu&s;bands to a bed-po&s;t, and whipped them too, to ren|der them more godly.</P>
<P>Do not think, my dear gentle friend, that I mean to treat your &s;cruples with a barbarous, unbecoming ridicule; no I only mean, though I attempt it but aukwardly, to divert your thoughts from dwelling too &s;eriou&s;ly and inten&s;e|ly on a &s;ubject which, if you &s;uffer it to prey &s;o continually on your &s;pirits, may undermine your health, without promoting any good end whatever. You entreat me to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf
<PB N="42" REF="44">
exactly in your &s;ituation, and tell you how I &s;hould act; you allow, however, that I cannot exactly conceive all your &s;en&s;ations. I am glad you furni&s;h me with &s;uch a comfortable excu&s;e for my &s;uperior weakne&s;s; for I am dreadfully afraid that in &s;uch a trial I &s;hould not po&s;&s;e&s;s even a moiety of your virtue and re&s;olution; my pre&s;ent partiality, as a mere friend to this fa&s;|cinating Seymour, convinces me of the turn that my feebler rea&s;on would take in his behalf. I &s;hould ea&s;ily per&s;uade my&s;elf that a man, who&s;e heart I thought had all the tender benevolence of the Go&s;pel, and who&s;e life, I hoped, would have much of its purity, might be ultimately more favoured by its Divine Author, than ma|ny mortals who conceal an antipathy for his laws under a boa&s;ted reverence for his name. My romantic fancy would &s;ugge&s;t to me, that if I endangered my own &s;oul by accepting &s;uch a lover, I &s;hould &s;till more deeply endanger his by refu&s;ing him; and, in &s;uch an alternative, I need not tell you for which hazard a fond, ge|nerous, romantic &s;pirit might decide. But, if I cannot &s;trengthen your re&s;olution, as you ex|pect me to do, by &s;incerely profe&s;&s;ing my&s;elf equal to &s;uch a great &s;acrifice as you meditate, I certainly ought, in owning my weakne&s;s, to own at the &s;ame time my apprehen&s;ions of its con&s;equence. I am one, I believe of tho&s;e very common characters, ju&s;t fooli&s;h and weak e|nough to act wrong on a very &s;evere trial; and ju&s;t wi&s;e and virtuous enough to feel ince&s;&s;ant remor&s;e for having done &s;o. Were I to marry Seymour in your &s;ituation, I am per&s;uaded I &s;hould be wretched if I failed in the hope of leading him by gentle degrees, to my own re|ligious
<PB N="43" REF="45">
per&s;ua&s;ion. To act on a vain confi|dence in &s;uch a hope would be, I acknowledge to act like a fool. Yet I feel that this folly, for|tified as it would be by all the illu&s;ive powers of Love, would be infinitely too &s;trong for my feeble rea&s;on. I &s;hould mo&s;t probably act ill from good affectionate motives, and be the dupe and victim of my own ab&s;urdity. Alas! what a bitter enemy is the tendere&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions to the &s;weet chearful &s;erenity of female life! Yet what different effects does it produce in the dif|ferent characters of our &s;ex! To the gentle, the artle&s;s, the open-hearted, Love is often a deep tragedy: to the notable and di&s;creet, it is a &s;ort of heavy &s;entimental comedy: to the per|fectly vain and capricious, it is neither better nor wor&s;e than an ab&s;olute farce. Now, my deare&s;t Cornelia, in my meditation upon Love and You (two ideas mo&s;t ea&s;ily united!)

<HEAD>LETTER VII. FROM MRS. AUDLEY TO LUCY.</HEAD>
<P>PRAY, my good girl, can you &s;end us any comfortable tidings of the run-away Seymour? To my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, we are all in a &s;tate of di&s;mal darkne&s;s concerning him. He left us rather abruptly, on the pretence of &s;udden bu|&s;ine&s;s in London. An odd &s;ea&s;on this for bu|&s;ine&s;s in the metropolis! From thence he has written me a letter that is very unlike him&s;elf, Very aenigmatical, and full of cold and formal
<PB N="46" REF="48">
civility. I thought I di&s;covered a great cloudi|ne&s;s on his brow for &s;ome days before he left us; and I am per&s;uaded that &s;omething pre&s;&s;ed with unu&s;ual weight upon his mind, though he would not confe&s;&s; it to me. I &s;eem to have di&s;obliged him, yet I know not how; and my dear Audley a&s;&s;ured me, on Seymour's &s;udden departure, that he was as much puzzled as I am to account for the &s;triking change in the be|haviour of our gue&s;t. The lovers cannot have had one of the petty quarrels &s;o apt to ari&s;e be|tween lovers, becau&s;e, with a marvelous &s;ingu|larity of di&s;cretion and re&s;erve, they have ab|&s;tained from all private interviews. I know not what to think. Sometimes I fancy that his ha&s;ty and unexpected decampment is a mere a|morous &s;tratagem, to try the real force of his fair-one's affection; yet Seymour is by no means a creature of artifice. Sometimes I am ready to fear that, like others of his volatile &s;ex and age, he is become a traitor in love, and that his heart has been &s;educed by the &s;prightli|ne&s;s and bloom of Loui&s;a to forget its loyalty to the poor, pen&s;ive, and pale Cornelia, who is in truth mo&s;t grievou&s;ly altered of late, and &s;eems to &s;uffer a daily diminution of her beau|ty and her health, that wounds me to the &s;oul. Yet, as his penetrating eyes mu&s;t have di&s;co|vered that this cruel effect has been occa&s;ioned by her unquiet love for him, I am rather inclin|ed to believe that it would more increa&s;e than dimini&s;h the attachment of a heart &s;o generous and &s;o tender. But, "I am weary of conjec|tures:" and, alas! I know not how "to end them," unle&s;s you can furni&s;h us with &s;ome au|thentic intelligence of our too intere&s;ting fugi|tive.
<PB N="47" REF="49">
If there is any one here who is more in his confidence than I am, it mu&s;t he his grate|ful Caroline, as he calls her; but if Caroline is really his prime confidante (as I a little &s;u&s;pect) &s;he is a very clo&s;e and tru&s;ty one indeed, as I cannot force a &s;yllable from her lips that will en|able me to gue&s;s at his pre&s;ent intentions. The warm-hearted creature will only &s;ay of her pro|tector, whom &s;he deems it a crime to mention without confidence and re&s;pect, that &s;he will pawn her life for the &s;incerity and continuance of his friend&s;hip for me, and of his love for Cor|nelia. Alas, the poor Cornelia! &s;he declares her&s;elf greatly relieved by Seymour's &s;udden de|parture; and &s;uch is this great relief, that &s;he can hardly &s;peak of it without dropping a tear; but whether a tear of heavenly gratitude, or of mortal regret, I &s;hall leave you, my dear &s;aga|cious &s;i&s;ter, to gue&s;s. For my part, I am quite out of luck, in my attempts to &s;tudy and to cor|rect the re&s;tle&s;s feelings of both our friends; and as it often happens to a well-meaning me|diator, I have partly lo&s;t the favour and confi|dence of each. Seymour is apparently di&s;plea&s;|ed with me; and I have offended the gentle Cornelia too, by repre&s;enting, perhaps too forcibly, the inability of her tender frame to per&s;evere without ri&s;king her life in an utter ab|juration of the man &s;he adores. Her delicate pride was a little wounded by my di&s;tru&s;ting her fortitude; but I hope I have made my peace with her, by a lucky quotation of a pa&s;|&s;age from an old ob&s;cure play, which I hap|pened to light upon very opportunely. It &s;truck me as a plea&s;ant hint to us good women, who pique our&s;elves now and then a little too

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>DO not think, my deare&s;t Edmund, that I have treated you ungratefully, in keeping you for &s;everal weeks in &s;u&s;pen&s;e and dark inquie|tude concerning the de&s;tiny of a friend for whom
<PB N="50" REF="52">
you have ever expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t engaging anxiety. A thou&s;and circum&s;tances have con|&s;pired to prevent my giving you more &s;peedy intelligence of my proceedings. In&s;tead, there|fore, of accu&s;ing me for being &s;ilent &s;o long, give me great credit for attempting to write to you in the&s;e moments. I &s;ay attempting to write; for I am not &s;ure that I can, even for your &s;ake, confine my attention to my paper; and you will not wonder at my doubt, when I tell you, that ever nerve in my frame is trem|bling with anxious impatience for the expected arrival of my Cornelia; yes, of <HI>my</HI> Cornelia. She is approaching to my arms, and I am wait|ing in the hou&s;e of a good elderly <HI>man of God,</HI> with a ble&s;&s;ed in&s;trument in my pocket, called a <HI>&s;pecial licence,</HI> prepared on purpo&s;e to make the dear angel my own Cornelia by the &s;weet lu&s;tre of the evening &s;tar. At this news my dear timid philo&s;opher him&s;elf will bur&s;t into a &s;hout of triumphant tran&s;port. But hold! I mu&s;t not betray you into treacherous exulta|tion, though I have the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes that we &s;hall &s;peedily exult together, on the con&s;ummation &s;o devoutly and &s;o prophanely wi&s;hed. I have &s;worn by Connubial Juno, to to make the lovely fond creature my bride this very night, if all-powerful Love, with his ca|pital agents, Opportunity and Importunity, can accompli&s;h it. Do not exclaim again&s;t my ra&s;hne&s;s and precipitancy. I have been driven to the mea&s;ures I am pur&s;uing. If vows are taken again&s;t me, mu&s;t I not oppo&s;e them by &s;tronger vows? Do you think Cupid is &s;uch a paltry engineer, that if a mine is contrived again&s;t him he cannot counteract it by a &s;upe|rior
<PB N="51" REF="53">
mine of his own contrivance? Do not fear.&mdash;The plan of my &s;urprize and attack is concerted in &s;o admirable a manner, that I am almo&s;t &s;ure of annihilating all powers of re&s;i&s;tence. But, if I can, I will tell you cir|cum&s;tantially the &s;teps that have led me to the pre&s;ent heart-agitating cri&s;is. When I fir&s;t got from Caroline a reluctant account of my lovely widow's ra&s;h vow, I thought it would have made me ab&s;olutely frantic; and perhaps it might had not my good grateful Caroline exerted all her zeal and ingenuity to &s;ooth, to comfort, and to per&s;uade me that Cornelia's pa&s;&s;ion for me is too &s;trong to let her per&s;evere in any bar|barous re&s;olution again&s;t me, however &s;olemnly enforced. With what exqui&s;ite &s;kill and rapidi|ty do penetrating women decypher one another! My kind and zealous comforter, who&s;e un|abated gratitude towards me is &s;o lively and enthu&s;ia&s;tic that I am convinced &s;he would chearfully hazard her life to en&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of my love, &s;he, I &s;ay, unveiled to me a thou|&s;and touching proofs of my Cornelia's fondne&s;s, which had e&s;caped the &s;earching eyes of the lover.&mdash;She maintained and upon &s;pecial good grounds, that if I had once got my tender idol into a &s;cene of perfect privacy, and had a fair opportunity of pre&s;&s;ing her to an immediate marriage, &s;he would be ju&s;t as unable to re&s;i&s;t me, as a &s;hip under way is unable to re&s;i&s;t the wind when it has filled every fail. I give you this forcible &s;imile in the very words of my excellent comforter and confederate, who has, you &s;ee, &s;tored her mind with images, as well as her heart with genero&s;ity, in the cour&s;e of her nautical adventures. We agreed that
<PB N="52" REF="54">
our dear diffident Cornelia &s;tands in dreadful awe of your devout brother; and although your plea&s;ant and friendly &s;i&s;ter Harriot warmly pro|fe&s;&s;es her&s;elf in advocate for our union, yet &s;he &s;ometimes makes u&s;e of arguments which pro|duce, perhaps, an effect rather injurious to my cau&s;e, by offending the delicacy of Cornelia.&mdash; For the&s;e and &s;undry other rea&s;ons, we agreed al&s;o in the opinion that my dear timid angel would be much more likely to indulge all the tenderne&s;s of her heart, if I could contrive to pa&s;s a day with her at a di&s;tance from her pious friends. We meditated on various &s;chemes to accompli&s;h this great object. Chance at length &s;ugge&s;ted a plan to us that I have pur&s;ued with the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. You may, perhaps, have heard of a very worthy old cler|gyman, who&s;e name is Danvers, and who re|&s;ales about fifteen miles to the South of your brother. With this Divine I had a &s;light per&s;o|nal acquaintance, as he is indebted for all his little preferment to the family of my mother. He is a primitive, &s;imple, retired character; as unlike as po&s;&s;ible, they tell me, to tho&s;e modern men of God who have made me, I confe&s;s, not very partial to prie&s;ts. Danvers is fond of privacy and peace, and he was once uncom|monly happy in his dome&s;tic circle; but death has robbed him, not only of an excellent wife but of a daughter who &s;upplied her place in training his younger olive-branches, of which (as they &s;eldom fail you know in holy ground) the good man has abundance. The&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing events in his family obliged the hone&s;t old par&s;on, at the hazard of a little &s;candal, to call in a female a&s;&s;i&s;tant; and, mo&s;t fortunately for me, the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
humble governe&s;s of his younger children is a &s;i&s;ter of my grateful Caroline. While we were debating how to contrive a private interview for me with Cornelia at a di&s;tance from your bro|ther's, Caroline happened to receive a letter from her &s;i&s;ter, who appears to be a good girl, almo&s;t as warm-hearted as her&s;elf. This letter was to &s;ay, that having many duties on her hands, which confined her at home, &s;he was unable to accompli&s;h her ardent de&s;ire of com|ing to wi&s;h her &s;i&s;ter joy of her fortunate mar|riage; but as the indulgent Cornelia had once had the goodne&s;s to bring Caroline to her, &s;he mo&s;t humbly petitioned for a repetion of that fa|vour on the pre&s;ent joyous occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This letter &s;truck both Caroline and me as a ray of light from Heaven. Our quick imagi|nations began immediately to make it our guide in forming the project that I was &s;o anxious to &s;ettle. It was agreed that I &s;hould depart &s;ud|denly from your brother's, and, by not explain|ing the cau&s;e or time of my ab&s;ence, awaken all the little jealous &s;urmi&s;es and fond alarms in the heart of Cornelia, to which that tender heart is &s;ufficiently inclined; that I &s;hould ha&s;|ten to renew and increa&s;e my acquaintance with Mr. Danvers, and engage him mo&s;t firm|ly in my intere&s;t by every po&s;&s;ible expedient.&mdash; Caroline undertook to furni&s;h me with con&s;tant intelligence concerning the health and affecti|ons of my dear and thus apparently de&s;erted widow. Alas! my tender angel has &s;uffered not a little from this apparent de&s;ertion; but I hope &s;oon to make her a rich attonement for life; and, as the intelligent Caroline &s;ays, no|thing is &s;o delicious and overcoming as the &s;ud|den
<PB N="54" REF="56">
&s;ight of a lover, whom a fond heart has al|mo&s;t de&s;paired of ever &s;eeing again. But, to re&s;ume the thread of my &s;tory: my excellent confederate undertook al&s;o to engage Cornelia for a di&s;tant day, to ride with her in the chai&s;e to Mr. Danvers's, and to let Mon&s;on attend them on hor&s;eback. I was to have early notice of the time appointed, that I might arrive there the day before, and adju&s;t all matters in the be&s;t method I could devi&s;e to accompli&s;h the grand object of my wi&s;hes. I ought to tell you, how|ever, in ju&s;tice to the excellent Caroline, that before &s;he would con&s;ent to this final arrange|ment of our plan, which looked, &s;he &s;aid, like betraying her patrone&s;s into my hands, &s;he bound me by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, that I &s;hould not attempt to make Cornelia my wife by any &s;pecies of violence, but merely by the fair influence of fond and pa&s;&s;ionate intreaty; an en|gine which my zealous confederate thinks &s;uffi|ciently powerful to en&s;ure us a victory. Heaven grant that &s;he may prove as true a prophet as &s;he is a tru&s;ty and invaluable ally! I have at length accompli&s;hed all the important preliminary points. As you know I little regard either fa|tigue or expence in the pur&s;uit of projects that intere&s;t my heart, you will readily believe that I have not been inactive or tardy in the great article of making Danvers my friend. I have been fortunately able to provide for two branches of his family; and I have &s;o com|pletely ingratiated my&s;elf with this warm-heart|ed old Divine, that I believe he would be hap|py to marry me to an empre&s;s, without &s;tipu|lating or wi&s;hing for a mitre as his reward. I
<PB N="55" REF="57">
have prepared him with a general, and as you may &s;uppo&s;e, a favourable idea of my preten|&s;ions and views towards his lovely expected vi|&s;itant. I have obtained a cordial promi&s;e from him, that, if I find it expedient, he will appear as my advocate, in oppo&s;ition to any religious &s;cruples that my fond, yet reluctant fair-one, may urge again&s;t me; for this hone&s;t man of GOD mo&s;t candidly acquie&s;ces in my leading propo&s;ition, that if I pay an exterior reverence to our E&s;tabli&s;hed Religion, and &s;olemnly en|gage to have my children educated in the be|lief of that Religion, there is nothing further which ought to be required of me; and all the re&s;t is a private bu&s;ine&s;s between my own heart and Heaven. This delightful old Divine goes farther on my &s;ide, as he is both in theory and practice a warm friend to the &s;upport and increa&s;e of the world. He &s;ays, that my lovely widow, having promi&s;ed to wed no other man, cannot refu&s;e me without a crime and a great crime too; he &s;ays, no le&s;s than a breach of the pri|mitive command; a command which &s;he has twice proved her&s;elf mo&s;t admirably qualified to fulfill. Here is a Par&s;on for you, my dear Ed|mund! a Par&s;on after my own heart! for who&s;e &s;ake I &s;hall be reconciled, I think, to the whole fraternity that I have &s;o cordially dete&s;ted. He is, in truth, a plea&s;ant original character, that you my dear morali&s;t, would have particu|lar delight in ob&s;erving. It was his maxim, he &s;ays, in early life, that if he had a faithful wo|man to embrace, and a &s;pirited book to read, with a decent provi&s;ion of daily bread, he &s;hould have every thing that his mind or body had a right to require; and he held it wi&s;er to &s;it con|tentedly
<PB N="56" REF="58">
down with the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, than to &s;cramble for the clerical toys of the world. In conformity to the&s;e principles, he devoted him|&s;elf to his wife and his &s;tudy. The fir&s;t I know only by her fruits: and the&s;e do her credit. In his &s;tudy I am now writing; and, if my heart and &s;oul were not too much occupied by the &s;cene in which I am &s;oon to &s;u&s;tain &s;o trying a part, I would give you a minute de&s;cription of this neat little library, and the fathers in folio, who are now &s;taring me in the face as if a&s;to|ni&s;hed at finding &s;uch an unclerical fellow as I am in the mid&s;t of &s;uch company. The wor|thier ma&s;ter of the&s;e venerable &s;helves is walk|ing in the little orchard that I command from the window, and meditating, I tru&s;t, a very pious and eloquent ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">angue in my favour. With two &s;uch &s;upporters as this liberal friendly man of GOD and the zealous beloved Caroline, I think it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for me to fail; yet, as the hour of deci&s;ion draws nearer and near|er, I feel the agitation of my heart increa&s;ing in the mo&s;t painful degree. One moment I am overwhelmed with the tran&s;porting idea of per|fect &s;ucce&s;s; and the next, I am ready to &s;ink under the agonies of a fancied di&s;appointment. But what &s;hould di&s;appoint me!

<HEAD>LETTER X. FROM MRS. AUDLEY TO LUCY</HEAD>
<P>IT falls to my lot, my dear Lucy, to give you that intelligence which I &s;olicited from you. Would to Heaven it were more chearful! But the intractable impetuous Seymour has involved him&s;elf, and all of us, in gloom and wretched|ne&s;s. In&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing a few &s;ocial and com|fortable weeks with you and Edmund, as I hoped he would, this ha&s;tly provoking creature has been trying a de&s;perate project with the poor unprepared Cornelia. He has reduced her &s;hattered nerves to the mo&s;t pitiable weakne&s;s that you can po&s;&s;ibly imagine, but without gain|ing the triumph he expected over her religious re&s;olution.</P>
<P>You, I know, my good girl, will join with me in admiring, in idolizing, the unconquer|able fortitude of this pure angel; and in la|menting, at the &s;ame time, the &s;evere de&s;tiny by which her tranquillity and her health are &s;o cruell de&s;troyed. But I am talking to you as of your were already apprized of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;tory that I have to impart. You will, I know, be painfully eager to hear all the particulars;
<PB N="61" REF="63">
and, as you have an unque&s;tionable right to hear them, I will give you as many, as I can.</P>
<P>If Caroline had not her high obligations, her ardent gratitude, and great merit of all kinds, to atone for one indi&s;cretion, I know not how it would be po&s;&s;ible for me to forgive her; for &s;he has been, in a great mea&s;ure, the &s;ource of all our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. She has been the con|federate of Seymour in a long train of artifice and deceit towards Cornelia; to which I &s;hould have thought her ingenuous nature could never have con&s;ented. But Gratitude, like Love, may be allowed to be blind; and this warm|hearted creature has acted in the whole affair from &s;uch generous motives, and is &s;o deep a &s;ufferer in her own heart and &s;oul, from the failure of the project, that, in&s;tead of feeling any la&s;ting anger again&s;t her, &s;he is nearly as much the object of my pity and admiration as our dear un&s;ubdued, but exhau&s;ted and almo&s;t, lifele&s;s, Cornelia her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of beginning my &s;tory as I ought to do, I am &s;till running into reflections upon it. But, that I may not torture your affectionate curio&s;ity, I will grow a more methodical hi&s;to|rian, and relate all I know in due order.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning the Mon&s;ons and Corne|lia &s;et forth, on an expedition for the day, to vi&s;it a very worthy old rural Divine, who&s;e hou&s;e and young family have been lately en|tru&s;ted to a &s;i&s;ter of Caroline's; and as the girl may be thought rather too young her&s;elf for the office of &s;uch a governe&s;s, our good Cornelia has been &s;olicitous to countenance her, by at|tending her favourite Caroline whenever &s;he
<PB N="62" REF="64">
went to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter. I little thought that the expedition of ye&s;terday had any motive on the part of Caroline, except &s;i&s;terly affection. Cor|nelia was rather inclined to remain with us, but I united my entreaties to tho&s;e of the eager &s;uppliant Caroline, and prevailed on her to join the little party, as I thought the ride and the amu&s;ement of a new chearful &s;cene would be beneficial to her declining health. In the even|ing I and Loui&s;a grew very anxious for her re|turn. The clock &s;truck nine, and no Cor|nelia appeared, though we had charged her to avoid the being abroad after &s;un-&s;et. As my niece and I were alone, we began to alarm our&s;elves with various fancied and fearful cau&s;es of her delay. We &s;auntered in weary expecta|tion, and, after looking a hundred times over the pales, were returning in de&s;pair into the hou&s;e, when we heard a hor&s;eman galloping at full &s;peed behind us, which, as we had now only the &s;tars to light us, increa&s;ed our alarm. It was Mon&s;on, whom the con&s;iderate Caroline had di&s;patched to &s;ave us from painful anxiety. He a&s;&s;ured us that Cornelia was &s;afe and well; but that the hours had glided away &s;o impercep|tibly, and the evening was grown &s;o late before &s;he thought of departing from Mr. Danvers's, that &s;he would not return till the morrow. My apprehen&s;ions were more awakened than quieted by this me&s;&s;age. I began to cro&s;s-examine Mon&s;on. He is a brave hone&s;t creature, with|out any talents for equivocation, I &s;oon brought him to a confe&s;&s;ion that Seymour had joined the party. Judge, my dear girl, of the unuttera|ble tumult of joy and concern, of hope and fear, that began to reign in my thoughts from this information. I could get little more from Mon|&s;on.
<PB N="63" REF="65">
He conjured me to hope and believe the be&s;t, and to wait patiently for the important tidings of next day; offering to ride back im|mediately, that I might have tho&s;e tidings with the utmo&s;t expedition. This, howe|ver, I would not allow. We all withdrew to our beds; but, for my part, I could not &s;leep a wink; and about one, I heard the rat|tle of Cornelia's chai&s;e, driving ha&s;tily to the door. I gue&s;&s;ed who it was, and flew half-naked, with my night-gown wrapped round me, to receive her. She had cro&s;&s;ed the hall, and reached the library; but could get no far|ther. The moment I appeared, &s;he &s;prang to|wards me; but &s;unk into my arms, and fainted. As &s;oon as &s;he revived, &s;he a&s;ked wildly for her children; and hurrying into her chamber, &s;he threw her&s;elf on her knees by the &s;ide of their bed, and exclaimed, "O, my dear infants, it is for your &s;ake that I have torn my poor heart to pieces! and GOD him&s;elf will rear you in in|nocence and happine&s;s as my reward. But what will become of the lo&s;t Seymour? His vio|lent nature will plunge him in vice, in mi&s;ery, in perdition!" At the&s;e words her whole frame was convul&s;ed with angui&s;h &mdash;The penitent and affrighted Caroline joined with me in con|juring her to be calm and &s;ilent; to let us put her immediately to bed, and give her &s;ome of the medicine to which &s;he has frequently had re|cour&s;e of late, and with con&s;tant good effect, in the &s;evere agitation of her nerves. The poor de&s;olate &s;oul was now all obedience to our in|junctions. She &s;poke not a &s;yllably more, but to expre&s;s her &s;orrow for proving &s;uch a &s;ource of trouble to her friends, and to ble&s;s us for our attention. Caroline and I did not &s;tir from her
<PB N="64" REF="66">
chamber till we had &s;een her tolerably compo&s;ed on her pillow. We then retired together to my room, where the &s;elf accu&s;ing Caroline began at once to condemn and to apologize for her own conduct.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, this well-meaning creature had un|guardedly betrayed to Seymour the ha&s;ty vow of Cornelia. From that moment his fiery in|dignant &s;pirit became intractable. Nothing would appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e him but a promi&s;e from Caroline to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the &s;ecret contrivance of &s;uch a project as they have ju&s;t carried into execution. Caroline confe&s;&s;es they both thought, and I mu&s;t own I &s;hould have been of their opinion, that it Seymour could obtain any good private op|portunity of urging Cornelia to an in&s;tant mar|riage, &s;he was too deeply enamoured to have the power of re&s;i&s;ting his ardent and pa&s;&s;ionate entrea|ties. I mu&s;t &s;ay, their plot was very ingeniou&s;ly conducted. Seymour, indefaticable in every pur&s;uit where his affections are intere&s;ted, and &s;anguine in every hope that his heart and fan|cy con&s;pire to cheri&s;h, had contrived to make the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d clergyman, Mr. Danvers, his hearty friend and advocate, and had provided him&s;elf with a &s;pecial licence, that, if a &s;ingle moment of yielding tenderne&s;s &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf, he might be &s;ure of rendering it deci&s;ive, and effectually preclude the dear &s;crupulous reluctant Cornelia from all po&s;&s;ibility of receding. The vehement and artful creature, though he had been lurking &s;ome time at Mr. Danvers's, did not make his appearance till after dinner. Our &s;weet, uncon&s;cious, and un&s;u&s;pecting friend was vi&s;ibly &s;urprized and delighted at the fir&s;t &s;ight of him. What pa&s;&s;ed in their private con|ference
<PB N="65" REF="67">
my informer cannot tell; but I ima|gine and hope that Edmund will have a full account of this ra&s;h and cruel affair from the hot brained lover him&s;elf Alas! poor fellow, he is probably cool enough by this time; for I have &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that he pa&s;&s;ed the night like a &s;ad wild Quixote as he is, on hor&s;eback, and perhaps wandering through our woods; but more of his nightly adventure in its proper place. I mu&s;t return to Mr. Dan|vers's.</P>
<P>Caroline &s;ays, that, when Seymour had been about two hours alone with Cornelia, he came with a mo&s;t agitated countenance to Mr. Dan|vers, and &s;aid, "I have been talking, Sir, to no purpo&s;e, to the mo&s;t marble-hearted woman that God ever created. Pray, my good venera|ble friend, pray come, and try for me if your arguments have more influence with her than mine."&mdash;Caroline remained with her &s;i&s;ter, while Seymour renewed his attack with his re|verend ally. She &s;ays, &s;he could hear that their discour&s;e was very warm and loud; but as no one came out of the room, and it grew late, &s;he &s;ent off her hu&s;band to me, with the be&s;t me&s;&s;age that &s;he could devi&s;e in her confu&s;ion, to prevent my being alarmed. The &s;ecret de|bate was continued, with encrea&s;ing vehemence, for more than another hour: when Danvers came out to Caroline, exclaiming, "Your la|dy is an angel indeed! I did not think there could be &s;uch divine eloquence, and &s;uch ange|lic integrity and fortitude in woman! But pray go and per&s;uade her not to depart, as &s;he talks of doing, at this late hour; but to honour and &s;anctify my humble roof by &s;leeping under it.
<PB N="66" REF="68">
I prote&s;t to God, &s;he shall be obeyed as an an|gel in all things. I will &s;ooner forfeit all the great ble&s;&s;ings that I owe to the genero&s;ity of Mr. Seymour, than ever appear as her antago|ni&s;t again. She mu&s;t be obeyed; but pray go, and try to prevail on her to &s;tay with us to night." Upon this the poor di&s;concerted Caro|line ventured into the room, aba&s;hed and trem|bling, as &s;he &s;ays, left &s;he &s;hould have incurred the everla&s;ting di&s;plea&s;ure of that kind patrone&s;s whom it would be wor&s;e than death to offend. On her opening the door, a &s;cene pre&s;ented it|&s;elf to her exactly the rever&s;e of what &s;he ex|pected. Seymour was &s;ilent, dejected, weep|ing; Cornelia &s;peaking, with a countenance radiant and glowing. She interrupted and an|ticipated the fir&s;t prayer of the penitent Caroline for pardon. "Your deceit, my good friend, cried the forgiving angel, has, I know ari&s;en partly from mi&s;taken kindne&s;s towards me, and partly from a laudible gratitude towards one who&s;e &s;ervices to you may &s;urely give a &s;ancti|on to any virtuous exce&s;s. But, for Heaven's &s;ake, my dear Caroline, order the chai&s;e im|mediately." "Aye, order it immediately, cried Seymour, &s;tarting from a &s;ort of &s;ullen reverie. The man who&s;e &s;ervices &s;he conde&s;cends to com|pliment cannot obtain from her the little &s;acri|fice of her pride." "Ungenerous Seymour, exclaimed the offended angel, have you a right to accu&s;e me of pride? you to whom I have fondly declared that, if you were but a faithful wor&s;hiper of the God I wor&s;hip, I would rather be your wife than married to any man, however exalted by faculties or &s;tation?" At this very ju&s;t and tender reproof the &s;ullen and imperi|ous
<PB N="67" REF="69">
Seymour threw him&s;elf at her feet, and be|gan to ki&s;s her hand with great vehemence bathing it with his tears. Caroline pau&s;ed, and hoped that the order for the chai&s;e would he recalled; but, alas! it was repeated by the un&s;haken Cornelia. "It is decided then, cried Seymour, &s;pringing up with a frantic air: we are to part for ever!" Caroline heard no more; but, quitting the room, went to order the chai&s;e; and, to her a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;aw Cornelia get into it unattended by Seymour. She &s;ays, that her own panic at that moment was the mo&s;t dreadful &s;he ever felt; for &s;he concluded, that being re&s;olved not to &s;urvive this galling di&s;ap|pointment, he was preparing to de&s;troy him&s;elf, and &s;he expected to hear the &s;ound of his pi&s;tol. An irre&s;i&s;tble impul&s;e hurried her, &s;he &s;ays, in this idea, into the little parlour where Cornelia had left him. She found him &s;itting, with a ter|rific &s;ternne&s;s of features, and eyes fla&s;hing with a di&s;dainful fury; but, at the &s;ight of his grateful and anxious Caroline, his proud heart &s;oftened. He caught her in his arms, and ex|claimed, "Heaven ble&s;s thee, thou mo&s;t gene|rous of friends! thou art the only being that I have ever met with on earth who&s;e ideas of Love and Friend&s;hip appear equal to my own.&mdash;Go, and enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings which thy affectionate heart has &s;o well de&s;erved; and I conjure thee, let them not be poi&s;oned by too keen a &s;en&s;e of my mi&s;erable lot. The extreme acutene&s;s of my pre&s;ent angui&s;h cannot la&s;t long. Go, my tender Caroline, go to thy happy Mon|&s;on; who &s;hall find me his friend, whether I live or die." Caroline, having ha&s;tily extorted a promi&s;e from him, that he would do nothing
<PB N="68" REF="70">
de&s;perate to de&s;troy his life, or impair his health, now followed Cornelia, who was receiving the compliments, or rather the adorations, of the venerable Danvers, who had handed her into her chai&s;e, and continued to expre&s;s his admi|ration of her principles and conduct, and his high &s;en&s;e of the honour which her vi&s;it had conferred upon him. As &s;oon as they drove from his door, Caroline began to repeat her en|treaties for pardon; but the poor Cornelia was in no condition to reply. The great efforts &s;he had made to &s;u&s;tain her &s;pirit in this long con|ference, and final parting, as &s;he imagined, with Seymour, had &s;o mi&s;erably exhau&s;ted her little portion of &s;trength, that, as &s;oon as &s;he was alone with Caroline, &s;he &s;unk into &s;uch a &s;tate of debility and tears as frightened her at|tendant to the greate&s;t degree. The terrified Caroline thought it would be hardly po&s;&s;ible to bring her home alive, and earne&s;tly implored her to turn back and pa&s;s the night under the friendly roof of Mr. Danvers; but in &s;pite of her extreme bodily weakne&s;s, the dear angel was firm in her purpo&s;e of returning. She declared that &s;he was already much relieved by her tears, and that, if Caroline would have the goodne&s;s to let her be quite &s;ilent, her &s;trength and &s;pirits would gradually revive. Caroline &s;ays they were perfectly mute for &s;everal miles. Corne|lia her&s;elf broke the &s;ilence, by a&s;king her in what condition &s;he had left the ra&s;h, mortified, and indignant Seymour. When Caroline de|&s;cribed the change in his features, from pride and fury to tenderne&s;s and gratitude, and re|peated the kind words in which he took leave of her, the poor Cornelia bur&s;t into a fre&s;h a|gony
<PB N="69" REF="71">
of tears; and ju&s;t as this had &s;ub&s;ided they arrived at our door.&mdash;Cornelia, in getting out of the chai&s;e, thought to &s;upport her&s;elf on the arm of the &s;ervant who had attended her on hor&s;eback; but, to her a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;he per|ceived, in reaching the ground, that &s;he had leant upon Seymour. She &s;tarted, and exclaim|ed, "O Heaven, are you come to per&s;ecute me here!" "No, Madam," replied her ha&s;|ty lover, &s;everely galled by her exclamation, "it is you alone who have the &s;pirit of per&s;ecu|tion&mdash;I per&s;ecute no one&mdash;I thought it my duty as a man, to guard you hither; and &s;ince I am rewarded only by a reproof, I here bid you farewell for ever." With this bitter adieu he &s;prang ha&s;tily upon his hor&s;e, and galloped away with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, as if he had no de&s;ire but to get at a di&s;tance from the woman by whom, though he knows &s;he loves him to di&s;traction, he thought him&s;elf in&s;ulted. It was, I imagine, this la&s;t unexpected meeting and parting which occa&s;ioned the fainting of our dear unhappy friend at the time when I flew to receive her.&mdash; Alas! how very grievous it is, that two &s;uch very amiable creatures, &s;o mutually enamoured &s;hould only prove a &s;ource of mi&s;ery to each o|ther! yet I am now &s;adly afraid that they are de&s;tined to be &s;o as long as they exi&s;t. What is become of the fiery Seymour, Heaven only knows! I mo&s;t cordially hope that he is bend|ing his cour&s;e to your hou&s;e; as there is no place, I think, where he can be &s;o kindly and properly taken care of in his pre&s;ent vexatious delirium. I charge you, my dear Lucy, to give us the fir&s;t news or him that you hear with the utmo&s;t expedition. This, indeed, I de&s;erve
<PB N="70" REF="72">
for writing to you, as I do at pre&s;ent, with &s;leeple&s;s and aching eyes. I was &s;o eager to get all the particulars I could from Caroline, that we &s;at up together till five this morning, and I quitted my bed again before nine to vi&s;it my poor Cornelia, and to di&s;patch this long hi&s;tory to you by the po&s;t of to-day. My dear patient has had a wretched night, and is &s;o faint and dejected that I have in&s;i&s;ted on her remaining in bed till &s;he hears the fir&s;t dinner-bell.&mdash;My dear Audley is at pre&s;ent in happy ignorance of all the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing adventures, and I believe I &s;hall keep him &s;o till he returns to us; for he has vex|ations more than enough where he is. Poor Verney died, as we expected; and my good hu&s;band has a very trouble&s;ome executor&s;hip to engro&s;s his attention.&mdash;I tell him, that I &s;hall begin to give him a bad character to the world, to exempt him from the&s;e burden&s;ome offices, which he has &s;o frequently drawn upon him&s;elf by his activity and benevolence.</P>
<P>I have kept this un&s;ealed to the la&s;t moment, in hopes that I might tell you wi&s;h comfort that Cornelia was a little revived. She is ju&s;t come down &s;tairs; but, alas! with looks &s;o piteous, and &s;uch an appearance of weakne&s;s and dejec|tion, that you, my dear tender Lucy, could hardly ca&s;t an eye on her &s;adly altered counte|nance without bur&s;ting into tears. Even our young and joyous Loui&s;a &s;ays &s;he never &s;aw a figure &s;o affecting. This good girl has a very tender heart, with all her wild vivacity; and behaves to Cornelia with a &s;weet compa&s;&s;ionate gentlene&s;s that plea&s;es me very much. Adieu.

<P>YOU are entitled, my dear Harriot, to my mo&s;t cordial and &s;peedy thanks, for your very kind and intere&s;ting, but grievous, account of your lovely gue&s;t, and the provoking ungovern|able, precipitate Seymour: I know not whither he has mo&s;t excited my anger or my pity, by this frantic mea&s;ure, which, his de&s;ponding friend Edmund &s;ays, will prove his utter de|&s;truction.

As to my&s;elf, you know I &s;eldom catch his de&s;pondency on any occa&s;ion; and I derive a ray of hope, which I am truly happy to communicate to you, from one ex|pre&s;&s;ion in a brief and ha&s;ty billet that Edmund has ju&s;t received. We &s;uppo&s;e it was written ju&s;t after the fatal conference, and perhaps be|fore he attended Cornelia to your door.

Now my good Harriot, do you not join with me in hoping that our divine enthu&s;ia&s;t of Genoa may repay the important &s;ervice &s;he received from this generous mi&s;guid|ed mortal; and, after &s;oothing the fiery tumult in his affections, re&s;tore him to us the rea&s;ona|ble religious being that we have &s;o vainly en|deavoured to make him; and, as the fond Cor|nelia once exclaimed to you,

<P>WE revive a little, my good girl; your very kind and animating &s;ugge&s;tion has done us more e&s;&s;ential good than all our medical re&s;to|ratives. Since I wrote to you I have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days in the mo&s;t bitter anxiety. The &s;en&s;ible and &s;anguine Bren&s;il him&s;elf, who is, you know, my oracle in medicine, was &s;o af|fected and alarmed, that he was little able to furni&s;h me with that hope and courage which I endeavoured to catch from him, and which, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, he is much inclined and well qualified to in&s;pire. He &s;ays he never in his life beheld a human frame reduced to &s;uch ex|treme debility by the mere agitations of heart and mind. As he is, you know, perfectly worthy of confidence, I thought it be&s;t to en|tru&s;t him with the whole private hi&s;tory; and I was plea&s;ed with the extreme &s;en&s;ibility which he di&s;covered on hearing what his two friends had endured. The tenderne&s;s of Cornelia, and the gallantry of Seymour, had intere&s;ted him &s;o much in their affection, that he was mortified as much as we are by the unfortunate turn it

Though he profe&s;&s;es to admire the devout fortitude of our friend, I can perceive that he would gladly have given a do&s;e of opi|um to her Piety, and of hart&s;horn to her Love, to &s;ecure a pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue to the precipitate en|terprize of the engaging Seymour. Who, as Bren&s;il &s;ays, can know him, and not wi&s;h his pro&s;perity? It is, I am convinced, an affec|tionate dread of proving the bane of his pro&s;pe|rity that gives the keene&s;t angui&s;h to the heart of Cornelia. Fond as &s;he is of the fa&s;cinating creature, &s;he could (I am now per&s;uaded) ea&s;ily relinqui&s;h his &s;ociety, enchanting as it is, and feel her&s;elf recompenced by the delight and pride &s;he takes in devoting her&s;elf to her chil|dren, if &s;he were not haunted by the terror that her rejection of Seymour will plunge that im|petuous mortal into the mo&s;t ruinous exce&s;&s;es of vice and folly. This terror had gained &s;uch dominion over her thoughts, that &s;he could hardly utter any other idea in the two or three fir&s;t days after the cruel conference. Indeed we allowed her to &s;peak but little; and &s;he was, and &s;till remains, much more inclined to &s;ilence than to conver&s;ation. At fir&s;t it &s;eemed as if all her bodily faculties were exhau&s;ted and de&s;troy|ed by the conflict &s;he had endured. She had utterly lo&s;t her appetite, and even her palate; at times a &s;ort of cold in&s;en&s;ibility, like petre|faction, appeared to be creeping over her frame. This would be &s;ucceeded by &s;uch a tremulous irritation of the nerves, and &s;uch a tendency to tears, that a &s;ingle word addre&s;&s;ed to her would &s;ometimes make her weep. Bren&s;il was griev|ou&s;ly afraid that &s;he was &s;inking into a rapid atrophy, which would hurry her to the grave.

He has watched this mo&s;t intere&s;ting of patients with a paternal anxiety. He has got various pre&s;criptions for her from the phy&s;ician, who&s;e in&s;ight into human maladies and affections is much deeper, he &s;ays, than that of all his fra|ternity. But they both agree that, as the heart of our tender friend is the main &s;eat of her di&s;|order, nothing will &s;o effectually contribute to her re&s;toration as the balm of &s;ympathy and friend&s;hip a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly applied to this lacerated heart. Their opinion has been vi&s;ibly con|firmed by the favourable impre&s;&s;ion which your kind letter, my dear Lucy, produced upon her &s;pirits. When I read to her what you &s;ay of Giuliana, a &s;udden flu&s;h aro&s;e on her pale cheek, and her &s;unk eyes &s;parkled with mo|mentary joy, "Ah, my dear Harriot, &s;he &s;aid, kind as you are, Lucy under&s;tands me better than you do.

But recovering her&s;elf with an a&s;toni&s;h|ing quickne&s;s and &s;pirit, "No, &s;he continued, I will no longer &s;uffer this horrid apprehen&s;ion to per&s;ecute my poor brain.

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>AT length I am got to Dover, but with a mind more tumultuous than the &s;ea I am going to cro&s;s. It was not thus with me, my dear Ed|mund, when I was la&s;t at this port with our lovely enthu&s;ia&s;t, the truly impa&s;&s;ioned Giulia|na; that heavenly woman could never have uttered &s;uch an in&s;ult to the man &s;he loved as I have heard, &s;ince I di&s;patched my &s;hort and ha&s;|ty billet to you, from the lips of her whom I was once fool enough to think &s;uperior in tenderne&s;s to Giuliana her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">When the inflexible bigot ordered her chai&s;e to depart from Danvers's, late at night as it was, indignation and re&s;entment &s;eemed to deprive me of motion. I could not put her into the carriage which was to convey her with &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable barbarity from him who had hoped to pa&s;s a bridal night in her arms. She bade me adieu with a cold &s;tately pride. It robbed me of utterance, and almo&s;t of my &s;en&s;es. I conti|nued &s;itting in the room &s;he quitted, with a brain ready to &s;plit with rage and di&s;appoint|ment. My good, grateful Caroline came to give me a tenderer farewell. Her &s;oftne&s;s was my pre&s;ervation. I wept upon her bo&s;om. I began to think le&s;s har&s;hly of Cornelia, becau&s;e this mo&s;t faithful of creatures &s;till laboured to convince me of her love. I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed this kind and &s;ypathetic confidante with the benediction of my heart, who&s;e fiery angui&s;h &s;he had &s;often|ed and relieved. As &s;oon as they drove away from Danvers's, I ordered my hor&s;e that I might attend them un&s;u&s;pected; and, before I mount|ed to gallop after the chai&s;e, I &s;crawled my &s;hort and di&s;mal letter to you. I &s;oon overtook the women; it was my intention merely to &s;ee them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">afe home, without letting them know that I did &s;o; but as I approached your brother's, my heart was more and more &s;oftened, by a recol|lection of many little proofs which Cornelia had there exhibited of her fondne&s;s towards me, and I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of helping her to alight from the carriage. She &s;tarted at the fight of me, and a&s;ked me, with an in&s;ulting tone that is &s;till re-echoed round my heart, "If I was come to <HI>per&s;ecute</HI> her there?" I hope the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pirit of my in&s;tantaneous reply has convinced
<PB N="81" REF="83">
her of the injury &s;he did me by that ba&s;e and barbarous expre&s;&s;ion. If it has not, my pre&s;ent conduct &s;hall &s;oon prove to her that an injurious word was never more mi&s;applied. If I have any knowledge of my own heart and mind, never was a human being le&s;s inclined than my&s;elf either to inflict or to endure persecution in any &s;hape. My &s;oul abhors every &s;hadow of tyran|ny; my evil de&s;tiny &s;eems determined that I &s;hall only prove a &s;ource of pain to tho&s;e who&s;e permanent happine&s;s I had the mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h to promote. But, in removing far from them, I may dimini&s;h perhaps this unfortunate influ|ence on their comfort. One &s;atisfaction I &s;hall at lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, that I can no longer be upbraid|ed with a de&s;ign of per&s;ecuting her who&s;e tran|quillity, ungrateful as &s;he is, I would willingly die to &s;ecure. To relinqui&s;h life, indeed, would be no &s;acrifice to me at pre&s;ent. I never wi&s;hed to live, but for the &s;ake of conferring happine&s;s on the objects of my affection; but as my per|ver&s;e &s;tars &s;eem to put this out of my power, they may terminate my exi&s;tence whenever they plea&s;e. I can die; as I have lived, without fear; becau&s;e a&s;&s;uredly I never meant to do any great deliberate evil; and I have vainly hoped to accompli&s;h much good, in which I have been thwarted, I know not why, by that my&s;terious power to whom, for the want of a better name, we give the title of De&s;tiny or Chance. The good Caroline expre&s;&s;ed to me a terror for which I mu&s;t love her &s;till more than I did, though it &s;hews more the trembling &s;en&s;ibility of her own heart, than her knowledge of my character: &s;he was terrified left I &s;hould de&s;troy my&s;elf in

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;tle&s;s wanderer, for whom, my dear Edmund, you will be too &s;olititous, is &s;afe at Lyons. I was eager to reach this city for vari|ous rea&s;ons; and cho&s;e, in the vain hope of amu&s;ement, to take a new way of approaching it. At Calais I procured a French coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el and landing at Rochelle, cro&s;&s;ed the country by the &s;horte&s;t road to Lyons. The &s;ea plea&s;es my fancy at pre&s;ent much more than land. I had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee this part of the French coa&s;t; and was &s;omewhat amu&s;ed in reflecting on the different &s;cenes and characters that it brought to my memory. At the &s;ight of La Hogue I felt a momentary triumph, while imagination pre&s;ented to my view the &s;plended &s;hips of Tour|ville de&s;troyed by the matchle&s;s bravery of our Engli&s;h &s;ailers. As we &s;ailed by Bellei&s;le, I could not help giving a &s;igh; but it was a &s;igh of envy, rather than compa&s;&s;ion, to the &s;hade of the accompli&s;hed Sir William Williams, repeat|ing
<PB N="85" REF="87">
with peculiar &s;atisfaction, as my eyes were fixed on the little i&s;land,
<Q><L>Here foremo&s;t in the dangerous paths of fame,</L>
<L>Young Williams fought for England's fair renown:</L>
<L>His mind each Mu&s;e, each Grace adorn's his frame;</L>
<L>Nor Envy dar'd to view him with a frown.</L></Q>
You remember Gray's &s;pirited epitaph on this gallant young &s;oldier.</P>
<P>What a capital advantage it is to have found an honourable place in the pages of an unperi&s;h|ing poet! I might have &s;ailed twenty times by Bellei&s;le without honouring the memory of Sir William Williams, had he not been immorta|lized by this epitaph.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;le of Rhee, all the vanity and vices of Buckingham pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my thoughts; but when I landed at Rochelle, I for|got my own countrymen, in recollecting the brave Hugonots, and the heard extremities they &s;uffered here in defending them&s;elves again&s;t a barbarous per&s;ecution. I think there is &s;ome|thing peculiarly &s;oothing to the &s;pirits in the gentle motion of a ve&s;&s;el, and the mixture of &s;ea and land pro&s;pect as you &s;ail along an ex|ten&s;ive coa&s;t. I found this part of my expediti|on much the mo&s;t medicinal to my mind. When I began to be jolted in a chai&s;e again, all my &s;plenetic &s;en&s;ations returned with new force. The &s;cenes as I pa&s;&s;ed, though they had the ad|vantage of novelty, afforded me no amu&s;ement. The ragged gaiety of the French pea&s;ants, in|&s;tead of tempting me to &s;mile, filled me with a mixed emotion of pity and contempt. "Poor merry fools, &s;aid I, ye have not &s;en&s;e enough to perceive your own glaring misfortunes!"</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88">Since my arrival at Lyons, my har&s;h and un|tuned &s;pirit has been a little &s;oftened and di&s;|ciplined by an affecting circum&s;tance among the good people who were particularly kind to me and the poor Giuliana during my alarming ill|ne&s;s in this city: there was a widow lady, a na|tive of Switzerland, advanced in life, of an ad|mirable under&s;tanding, and mo&s;t engaging man|ners. Her only child, a very hand&s;ome and ac|compli&s;hed young fellow, had ju&s;t got a com|mi&s;&s;ion in the Swi&s;s &s;ervice; the fir&s;t news I heard at my hotel was the luckle&s;s fate of this fine lad, who lo&s;t his life about three weeks ago, in a &s;udden fray concerning a beautiful girl of fa|mily and fortune, who&s;e hand he had great hopes of obtaining. I felt my&s;elf bound in gra|titude to pay a vi&s;it of con&s;olation to his afflict|ed mother as &s;oon as I heard of her calamity. Our unexpected meeting has, I tru&s;t, been of great &s;ervice to us both. In catching the ten|derne&s;s of her &s;orrow, I have certainly corrected in &s;ome degree, the a&s;perity of my own mind; and if I have not reconciled her to her lo&s;s by argument, I have at lea&s;t &s;oothed her angui&s;h by &s;ympathy. When &s;he related to me, with the frankne&s;s of true affliction, all her very bit|ter maternal &s;en&s;ations, I could not help ex|claiming, "Would to Heaven, my dear Ma|dam, that I could re&s;tore your &s;on to you, by &s;upplying his place in the grave! Such an ex|change would be a ble&s;&s;ing to us all, for my life has lately been made as wretched as his had the pro&s;pect of being happy." I &s;aid this to ea&s;e the fullne&s;s of my own heart, and to call off the mind of this deeply-feeling mother from her own poignant di&s;tre&s;s. The latter effect it pro|duced
<PB N="87" REF="89">
completely: for, &s;truck by the pathetic energy with which I had uttered this wi&s;h, &s;he caught hold of my hand, and conjured me to tell her what could have poi&s;oned the enjoy|ments of a per&s;on who, in recovering health, &s;he &s;aid, &s;eemed to have recovered every thing that could be wanting to en&s;ure his felicity.</P>
<P>In the hope of diverting her &s;orrow, I gave her my whole hi&s;tory. She li&s;tened to it with great attention, and made many &s;en&s;ible and friendly remarks as I proceeded. When I had fini&s;hed, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, with that touching elo|quence which keen feelings generally in&s;pire, her admiration and her pity for Cornelia. "Good Heaven! &s;he exclaimed, to lo&s;e &s;uch a lover, and to lo&s;e him from &s;uch a motive, mu&s;t be &s;till more excruciating than the death of a darling child; for if the beloved object is not &s;o dear to her, which I think in nature it cannot be, yet in her ca&s;e there is the dread of lo&s;ing it through all eternity. Have you, my dear Sir, have you ever cooly reflected on the horrors which this idea mu&s;t impre&s;s on the heart of a tender, impa&s;&s;ioned woman? Poor, poor Cornelia! &s;he is more mi&s;erable than I am. My &s;on was, I ble&s;s GOD, untainted by the wretched infidelity &s;o common in the world; and I tru&s;t a few years will re&s;tore us to each o|ther in a better life. This ble&s;&s;ed tru&s;t is my &s;upport; but what, my mi&s;guided friend, what is there to &s;upport your divine, yet de&s;olate Cor|nelia? What would the pro&s;pect of Heaven it|&s;elf be to me, if I had no a&s;&s;urance of meeting there the idols of my heart! yet, in one point of view, this lady for whom you have made me weep, though I thought my tears all exhau&s;ted
<PB N="88" REF="90">
or engro&s;&s;ed by my own &s;elfi&s;h &s;orrow, &s;he, I &s;ay has &s;till one advantage over me: the GOD that &s;he and I wor&s;hip has cea&s;ed to open the grave; he recalls no &s;econd Lazarus from the tomb; buy &s;uch a miracle as might change her affliction into joy is &s;till frequently vi&s;ible on the earth.</P>
<P>Perhaps a day never pa&s;&s;es in which his divine mercy does not recall to him&s;elf the alienated heart of &s;ome unbeliever. O that I could re|ward you for the generous intere&s;t you have taken in my affliction, by being in any degree in&s;trumental to &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed change in my young and mo&s;t unfortunately mi&s;guided friend! but, alas, &s;he added with a deep &s;igh, I have &s;een in a brother of my own the intractable and obdurate pride which an early taint of Infi|delity in&s;pires; and &s;ince the arguments and the tears of your angelic Cornelia were unable to convert you, I &s;hould be vain indeed if I thought any thing that an afflicted old woman could urge to you might produce that effect. No, my dear, ra&s;h friend, GOD only can pro|duce it; and I mo&s;t devoutly hope that he will." The good old lady uttered her pious hopes with &s;uch an air of maternal tenderne&s;s and anxiety for my welfare, that I was affected almo&s;t to tears, and felt, for the fir&s;t time in my life, that I had lo&s;t a great deal in lo&s;ing my mother before I was old enough to comprehend the en|dearing charm of maternal &s;olicitude and affec|tion. I &s;oon turned the conver&s;ation to other &s;ubjects, that I might &s;ay nothing offen&s;ive to her friendly and devout &s;pirit. We perfectly agreed in one &s;erious &s;entiment, that tho&s;e who die early &s;eem to be the favourites of Heaven;
<PB N="89" REF="91">
and we parted, both plea&s;ed and pained by each other, and both, I think, the better for our in|terview. For my part, I felt my mind, as I have already told you, much &s;oftened; and I began to think of Cornelia with tenderne&s;s, ad|miration, and pity, in&s;tead of fierce di&s;dain and indignant re&s;entment. Indeed, this turn of mind had been already produced, in &s;ome de|gree, by my gradual recollection of all the ten|derer pa&s;&s;ages in our long conference at Mr. Danvers's.&mdash;My &s;oul was at fir&s;t &s;o full of in|dignation, for the bitter and unmerited in&s;ult with which &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me at your brother's door, that, in trying to throw all our di&s;cour&s;e on paper, I could for &s;ome time only recollect completely tho&s;e parts of it in which her bigotry and her pride were mo&s;t con&s;picuous; but, by degrees, every tenderer expre&s;&s;ion occurred with new force to my recollection; and in the inclo&s;ed paper you will find a very faithful nar|rative, as I promi&s;ed you, of our important conference. I will only detain you from its pe|ru&s;al while I make one very hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, and it is this: I have peru&s;ed the fair tran&s;cript I &s;end you &s;everal times, and at every fre&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eading I have, without &s;hrinking from my own tenets, felt my&s;elf more and more ena|moured of my lovely, eloquent, and tender zealot. Nay, I profe&s;s to you, I would in|&s;tantly turn back and make her my own for life, if I could do it by any means that would not expo&s;e me to my own contempt; but, in my opinion, no man de&s;erves the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch exqui&s;ite beauty, who will conde&s;cend to purcha&s;e it by playing the hypocrite or the fool; yet, &s;uch is the folly or perver&s;ene&s;s of women

<HEAD><HI>Inclo&s;ed in the preceding Letter.</HI> An exact Account of my la&s;t conference with Cornelia.</HEAD>
<P>YOU will recollect, my dear Edmund, that, in order to give my lovely invalid &s;ufficient time and tranquillity to recruit her &s;pirits at Mr. Danvers's, I refrained from appearing there till after &s;he had dined. On my &s;udden entrance, a &s;mile of &s;urprize, and I believe of tender &s;atisfaction, illuminated her counte|nance. She &s;eemed plea&s;ed to find me &s;o fa|miliarly acquainted with a worthy old clergy|man. But when the par&s;on, who is a man of eager &s;pirits, contrived, a little too rapidly per|haps, to leave us &s;hut up alone in his little par|lour, &s;he &s;eemed to be alarmed, and would have quitted the room. Upon my humble &s;upplica|tion that &s;he would li&s;ten with patience to many important things I had to &s;ay to her, &s;he &s;at down with a placid dignity that filled me with a mixed &s;en&s;ation of awe and delight. I began by expre&s;&s;ing my tender fears concerning the very delicate &s;tate of her health and &s;pirits. I &s;aid that I had &s;acrificed my highe&s;t joy in the daily &s;ight of her at your brother's to an idea ill-founded perhaps, yet certainly generous, that her mind might be more tranquil if I
<PB N="92" REF="94">
quitted the party. Here, Edmund, the lovely creature blu&s;hed immoderately, from a fear, I believe, that I alluded to her jealou&s;y of Loui|&s;a. I &s;oon relieved her from that apprehen&s;ion, by &s;hewing her I meant only that embarra&s;&s;|ment and inquietude which naturally ari&s;es be|tween two people who have much to &s;ay to each other on the mo&s;t delicate of &s;ubjects, and have not arrived at the period appointed for di&s;cu&s;&s;|ing it; I hoped that we might both be more tranquil in a &s;hort &s;eperation; but, on my &s;ide, I had felt all the pains of that egregious mi&s;take; the attempt to direct my thought to other ob|jects had only convinced me that to pa&s;s even a day from her was torment; that, finding my life a burthen to me, in the cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e I la|boured under, I could no longer delay to &s;olicit a promi&s;e of her hand; that my hopes were &s;ounded, not only on that ardent and perfect love which triumphs over fear, but on the ani|mating a&s;&s;urances which I had received from many of our common friends, who con&s;idered us as happily formed for each other, and who had confirmed me in the bli&s;sful per&s;ua&s;ion that my pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to her had awaked a tender partiality in her bo&s;om, which I re|garded as the pride of my life, and the ba&s;is of my felicity. When I pau&s;ed, and waited for her reply with an anxiety as inten&s;e as if her &s;entence were to fix my eternal doom; in&s;tead of ca&s;ting her mode&s;t eyes towards the ground, &s;he fixed them upon mine with a look that &s;eemed to &s;crutinize my &s;oul, and, without any prudi&s;h efforts to force from me her hand, which I had fondly cla&s;ped, &s;he &s;aid, "You know, my dear Sir, that I have pro|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="93" REF="95">
to treat you with the frank and ingenu|ous tenderne&s;s of a &s;i&s;ter: my obligations to you are infinite; my e&s;teem and admiration of your character not inferior to that of the many friends by whom you are &s;o zealou&s;ly beloved. How far tho&s;e kind and well-meaning friends may have flattered and deluded you and them|&s;elves in what they have &s;aid on a pro&s;pect of our union, is a point that mu&s;t depend entirely on your&s;elf." "Then you <HI>will be mine,</HI> an|gelic creature!" cried I, in a tran&s;port of fran|tic joy; for I con&s;trued the la&s;t &s;entence into an immediate con&s;ent. "Pardon me, my too ha&s;ty friend, &s;he continued with a &s;erious air that half petrified me, I have &s;aid no &s;uch thing. Do not, I conjure you, wre&s;t any of my words to a wrong meaning; and I promi&s;e you in return, that, difficult and painful as I find it is to &s;peak to you at large on this &s;ub|ject, I will yet endeavour to &s;peak to you with all that unequivocal openne&s;s of heart which con&s;titutes in my opinion the e&s;&s;ence of true friend&s;hip." I thanked her, ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and continued to li&s;ten in &s;ilent adora|tion. "I will not pretend, &s;aid the dear in|genuous creature, to be angry with you for a &s;tep which has however &s;urprized me. It is na|tural for you to wi&s;h a &s;peedy termination to your &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Indeed it is highly de&s;irable for us both that nothing like indeci&s;ion &s;hould ap|pear between us. I have told you with great &s;incerity, that it was my re&s;olution to live un|married for the &s;ake of tho&s;e dear children who have the mo&s;t engaging claims to my love, and have been peculiarly recommended to my care. Men are not apt, and I confe&s;s they have no
<PB N="94" REF="96">
great rea&s;on, to give entire credit to &s;uch re&s;o|lutions. At a time when my &s;olicitude for your life made me extremely anxious to tranquillize your agitated &s;pirits, I gave you a promi&s;e, which, believe me, I &s;hall never wi&s;h to re|tract, 'that you &s;hall never &s;ee me the wife of another.' I will confe&s;s to you, my dear friend, that this was not a promi&s;e of mere pity, but of genuine affection. Yes, Seymour, I am not a&s;hamed to &s;ay that I love you, becau&s;e my rea&s;on has taught me to &s;et bounds to my re|gard; and I can tell you with firmne&s;s, though not without pain, that I mu&s;t and will reject your very flattering offer, becau&s;e there is an in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to our union, which &s;ome late occurrences, and your own con&s;cious mind will explain to you." With my veins thrilling with rapture at the &s;weet avowal of her love, I had caught her in my arms before &s;he uttered the &s;teady and &s;tern declaration that &s;he would not indulge it. "No, I exclaimed with mingled &s;en&s;ations of tran&s;port and of horror, there is no ob&s;tacle&mdash;there &s;hall be none; we are united by mutual love, the mo&s;t &s;acred of all bonds; and no powers in the world &s;hall di|vide us." "There is a power more &s;acred than Love, replied the &s;tedfa&s;t angel; and it grieves me, Seymour, to the &s;oul, to perceive it is a power that you do not acknowledge: I need not tell you, &s;he continued, that I mean Religion&mdash;a power which, I tru&s;t, will ever re|gulate my conduct, and which forbids me to be your wife."</P>
<P>I endeavoured, though I believe very auk|wardly, to treat her apprehen&s;ions of my irreli|gion with levity; but the offended angel re|buked
<PB N="95" REF="97">
me, and &s;aid, "I beg, Sir, that our conver&s;ation may be &s;erious; if you have no re|&s;pect for Religion, you at lea&s;t profe&s;s your&s;elf mo&s;t inviolably attached to Truth and Honour; and indeed I mu&s;t do you the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that I never knew any human being on who&s;e gene|rous veracity I could more implicitly confide: wretched indeed &s;hould I feel my&s;elf at this mo|ment, if I were de&s;titute of that con&s;olatory confidence; but my e&s;teem for you, Seymour, is &s;uch, that, I am firmly per&s;uaded, you have truth and magnanimity &s;ufficient to &s;upport a weak woman again&s;t your&s;elf. In&s;tead of try|ing to delude me by any &s;pecies of hypocri&s;y into a marriage, which mu&s;t render us both wretched if our religious &s;entiments are &s;o wide|ly different as I have rea&s;on to apprehend, you, I am convinced, will have the genero&s;ity to avow that difference, if it exi&s;ts, and to ap|plaud my adherence to my duty in pronouncing it an in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to our union." I thanked her for the noble confidence which &s;he placed in my truth; and a&s;&s;ured her mo&s;t &s;o|lemnly, that I would never attempt to deceive her in any article whatever; &s;till repeating, that there is, and &s;hall be, no ob&s;tacle to our union.</P>
<P>Here, Edmund, the kind &s;oul in her turn caught a &s;udden ray of delu&s;ive hope, by half con&s;truing my words into a confe&s;&s;ion of faith; and, looking at me with an angelic &s;weetne&s;s of countenance, &s;he &s;aid, "Can you, Seymour, can you truly affirm, that you revere and believe in that Religion which I have been taught to regard as the only &s;ure foundation of happine&s;s, both in this world and the next?"
<PB N="96" REF="98">
I endeavoured to evade the que&s;tion, by vindi|cating the freedom of thought, and the native rights of the mind, to keep any ideas &s;ecret that related only to Heaven and it&s;elf. But, &s;hrink|ing from me with a face of horror, &s;he &s;aid, "I know, Seymour, you are too noble to utter a direct fal&s;hood; and do not, I intreat you, do not &s;toop to an eva&s;ion; there is no nece&s;&s;ity for any thing &s;o foreign to your nature. I have no right to pry farther into your &s;entiments; I have done with the &s;ubject for ever, and have only to pray, which I do mo&s;t devoutly, that, however mi&s;guided your early life may be, you may not end your days in this terrible delu&s;ion." Here the tender enthu&s;ia&s;t ca&s;t upon me a look &s;o pite|ous, that, I believe, at that moment &s;he beheld me in her fancy hurried away from her by fiends, and &s;inking into eternal perdition. The image, whatever it was, overwhelmed her; &s;he bur&s;t into tears, hid her lovely troubled counte|nance for a few moments, and then endeavoured to quit the room. This, however, I could not &s;uffer her to do. I detained her by pa&s;&s;ionate &s;upplications. I conjured her not to be &s;o fla|grantly unju&s;t as to condemn me unheard. I &s;aid that &s;he had ha&s;tily and cruelly adopted the mo&s;t terrific ideas of my impiety from the ba&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions of a proud, phari&s;aical prie&s;t, who injured me in her opinion, becau&s;e, with a fool|i&s;h good nature to indulge his pa&s;&s;ion for wine, I had plunged into occa&s;ional intemperance, which I had not a prie&s;tly &s;tomach to bear. I was growing &s;till more &s;evere again&s;t my &s;ancti|fied enemy Dr. Ayton, when Cornelia inter|rupted me with vehement di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;aid with an unu&s;ual keene&s;s of manner, "You
<PB N="97" REF="99">
give me but too evident proofs of an unchri&s;ti|an &s;pirit, in this a&s;perity again&s;t a worthy Di|vine, who did full ju&s;tice to your many virtues, and only &s;aid of your failings what his duty and his con&s;cience obliged him to &s;ay."&mdash; I caught fire at this double in&s;ult; this reproof to me, and panegyric on the man whom I have rea&s;on to dete&s;t. I reminded my &s;evere monitor of the many diabolical injuries which the&s;e o|ver-righteous zealots have committed in every age, under the &s;tale pretences of their duty and their con&s;cience; and I prote&s;ted that I had rather be the vile&s;t outca&s;t of the world, aban|doned by earth and Heaven, than one of the&s;e &s;anctified dealers in &s;lander, who poi&s;on the peace of their acquaintance by mi&s;repre&s;entati|ons of men more hone&s;t than them&s;elves, and at the &s;ame time pretend to be the only true &s;er|vants to the GOD of Truth. "This Divine, &s;aid I, whom you commend, my dear Cornelia, &s;o much beyond his de&s;ert, has impre&s;&s;ed a bar|barous panic on your tender imagination; he has made you con&s;ider me as a mon&s;ter of impie|ty; I am appri&s;ed, you &s;ee the force of the brutal idea, and of the brutal expre&s;&s;ion, with which he laboured to divide us; but I will appeal to your own hone&s;t heart, again&s;t your terrified imagination, except in that fatal night when in|toxication bereaved me of my &s;en&s;es, and when true charity would have ca&s;t a veil over my frantic words and actions, have I ever merited this outrageous appellation? Nay, I will go much farther: I will con&s;ent to re&s;t all my hopes on the i&s;&s;ue of this candid que&s;tion; do you not think in your con&s;cience, from the perfect knowledge you have of my general character, that if you
<PB N="98" REF="100">
ble&s;s me with your hand, my future life will be affectionate and virtuous?" "Ah, Seymour, &s;aid the dear creature with a &s;oft emotion in which Love and Terror were blended, you have &s;uch in&s;inuating addre&s;s, that I mu&s;t not li&s;ten to you on a point in which it would prove &s;o ve|ry fatal to me to have my weak rea&s;on over|whelmed or deluded. I &s;hall be ever ready to do the mo&s;t grateful ju&s;tice to your many noble and engaging qualities; but I mu&s;t never forget that it is my duty, and my determination, to prote&s;t, in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive manner, that nothing &s;hall ever tempt me to become the wife of an infidel." I remon&s;trated again&s;t the in|ju&s;tice of giving this title to any man who paid a decent regard to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion of his country. We &s;kirmi&s;hed for &s;ome time on this ground, till at la&s;t, finding her inflexible, and being &s;orely galled by &s;ome har&s;h things &s;he &s;aid, I went to &s;ummon my reverend ally Mr. Dan|vers to my aid, and cheri&s;hed a little hope that I might be able, with his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to give a more happy turn to the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>"Since, Madam, &s;aid I, introducing my ve|nerable old friend, &s;ince you are &s;o cruelly deaf to every thing I &s;ay in my own favour, will you have the conde&s;cen&s;ion to let this worthy man of GOD plead with you in my behalf? He does not reckon me a mon&s;ter of impiety, though a wretch of his order has ba&s;ely repre&s;ented me as &s;uch to you," "I am &s;orry, Madam, &s;aid the good Danvers, that many of our dignified clergy are &s;o apt to forget that charitable meek|ne&s;s and indulgence, which would become them much better than the contemptuous and cruel pride with which they often treat per&s;ons whom
<PB N="99" REF="101">
they &s;uppo&s;e inferior to them&s;elves in holine&s;s, becau&s;e their &s;tation is different. I was once nearly branded as an Athei&s;t my&s;elf by an of|fended Bi&s;hop, becau&s;e I had the &s;pirit in my young days to re&s;i&s;t an arbitrary abu&s;e of his e|pi&s;copal privileges. I triumphed in the vindi|cation of my character; but have &s;uffered not a little, perhaps, in my eccle&s;ia&s;tical fortune. The rank of Mr. Seymour happily exempts him from being injured in the manner that we poor little par&s;ons may be injured; yet if any cruel mi&s;repre&s;entation has prejudiced him in your good opinion, I will venture to &s;ay, my dear Lady, that &s;uch prejudice is a greater misfortune to him than the lo&s;s of the riche&s;t benefice in the kingdom could be to me; and I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy indeed if I am able to redre&s;s the wrong that has been done, and to rein&s;tate him in your favour. For my part, I have ever re|garded tho&s;e men as the mo&s;t meritorious &s;er|vants of GOD, who do, in proportion to their abilities, the greate&s;t number of good deeds; and I believe it would be difficult to find any man of Mr. Seymour's age, in the kingdom, who has been more di&s;tingui&s;hed by acts of charity and munificence. For my own part I am bound to bear witne&s;s to his virtues as long as I exi&s;t, for he has &s;aved one unhappy child of mine from impending de&s;truction, and given efficacy and happine&s;s to the hone&s;t exertions of a &s;econd. We have all the highe&s;t rea&s;on to ble&s;s him; and it would grieve me to the &s;oul to &s;ee a lady &s;o lovely, and &s;o truly beloved as you are, make &s;uch a &s;uitor unhappy (perhaps for life) in con&s;e|quence of any religious prejudice again&s;t him, unworthily in&s;tilled into your tender mind." It
<PB N="100" REF="102">
was in this manner, my dear Edmund, that my hone&s;t par&s;on began to trumpet forth my prai&s;es, while I watched every change in the varying features of Cornelia. Though &s;he li&s;tened i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Danvers with more &s;erenity than &s;he did to me, there was &s;till an air of trouble on her counte|nance, and in&s;tead of encouraging my advo|cate by a &s;mile of acquie&s;cence in his panegy|ric, &s;he &s;eemed to be collecting all the powers of her mind to &s;upport a firm re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the combined petitioners by whom &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;o pertinaciou&s;ly be&s;ieged. From the expre&s;&s;ion of her face while Danvers was &s;peaking, I ex|pected a very tart reply; but here I was agree|ably di&s;appointed. With that engaging and maje&s;tic mildne&s;s which is peculiar to her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid to my warm-hearted panegyri&s;t, "We are not likely, my good Sir, to differ on the ge|nero&s;ity of Mr Seymour, to which it &s;eems we have both of us very uncommon obligations. For my own part, I am willing to con&s;ider it as a new proof of his genero&s;ity towards me, that he has cho&s;en a man of your age and charac|ter to be the arbitrator of the painful but impor|tant difference between us. For you, my wor|thy old friend, you are involved in a &s;ituation &s;omewhat &s;imilar to mine. I can feel for you, as I feel for my&s;elf; you are partly overwhelm|ed by a &s;en&s;e of gratitude and attachment to Mr. Seymour, and yet will find your&s;elf, as I am, under a bitter nece&s;&s;ity to pronounce again&s;t him. I am confident that a man &s;o re&s;pectable as you are for a long life of piety, will never advi&s;e me to accept as my hu&s;band an enemy to the God whom you &s;erve." "Heaven forbid! exclaimed the &s;pirited Danvers. If I were weak
<PB N="101" REF="103">
and wicked enough to do &s;o for any worldly temptation, believe me, Madam, I &s;hould be, like the penitent and pious Cranmer, di&s;tracted by the &s;en&s;e of my own infirmity, and eager to atone for it by martyrdom. But, on the other &s;ide, my dear lady, let us be cautious for Hea|ven's &s;ake, and not treat any per&s;on too ha&s;tily as an enemy to God. Surely that very hard appellation cannot be ju&s;tly applied to our gene|rous friend. I &s;peak not with any reference to his bounty towards my&s;elf. There have been, GOD knows, many enemies of GOD, who have lavi&s;hed their trea&s;ure on his unworthy mini&s;ters, but &s;urely the&s;e men have been widely different in their characters and their pur&s;uits from Mr. Seymour." Here, Edmund, the gentle Cor|nelia appeared confu&s;ed; &s;eemed to think &s;he had gone too far, and looked half-relenting. I would not interrupt my devout advocate, and only pre&s;&s;ed her hand in &s;ilence. "I will tell you, my dear Madam, very frankly, continu|ed Danvers, that Mr. Seymour has confe&s;&s;ed to me that his mind was never di&s;ciplined and in|&s;tructed, as it ought to have been, in the prin|ciples of our faith. Like mo&s;t young men of his rank, he has hitherto thought too little or too lightly of our mo&s;t important concerns; yet, in&s;tead of calling him an enemy to Religion, I &s;hould rather call him its friend, &s;ince he ex|pre&s;&s;es a great de&s;ire to adopt more &s;erious ideas, and &s;ince he pur&s;ues the mo&s;t likely method to make him a good and religious man, by trying to connect him&s;elf with a lady &s;o attached to her &s;acred duties, and by promi&s;ing that his chil|dren &s;hall have the advantage, which he has unhappily wanted him&s;elf, of an early religious
<PB N="102" REF="104">
education. Surely a man &s;o benevolently di&s;|po&s;ed will be gradually enlightened by the per|fect knowledge of that Divine Ma&s;ter whom he is de&s;irous to know, and whom, when he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> once truly known the beatitude of his &s;ervice, he can never for&s;ake. Your virtue, my dear Madam, will have the glory and the delight of accompli&s;hing a work &s;o angelic. Do not, therefore, I entreat you, by a precipitate rejec|tion, exa&s;perate the high but well-di&s;po&s;ed &s;pirit of an ardent young man, who loves you almo&s;t to di&s;traction. Do not make him, what he has been too ha&s;tily called, an enemy to Religion." Cornelia was &s;o deeply affected by this unex|pected intreaty from the good old Divine, that her gentle bo&s;om began to heave with emotions that I was willing to &s;uppo&s;e the effect of return|ing tenderne&s;s. As &s;he had hid her lovely im|pa&s;&s;ioned countenance, I thought I had every rea&s;on to con&s;true her &s;ilence into con&s;ent, and exclaimed with impetuous rapture, "My &s;weet angel yields to your heavenly per&s;ua&s;ion! &s;he will be mine! O thou worthy man of God, &s;aid I, cla&s;ping the hand of the delighted Danvers, thou &s;halt &s;peedily complete thy ble&s;&s;ed work. Here is an in&s;trument that will authorize thee to unite us immediately for ever."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, I drew the &s;pecial licence from my pocket; but it &s;eemed to turn into a warrant for my death, the moment I beheld the countenance with which the recovering Cor|nelia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow gazed upon it. Her mode&s;t eyes lightened with indignation at the &s;ight. She accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed me of pre&s;umptuous vanity&mdash;of indeli|cate precipitation.

to mine in the public papers. In &s;hort, &s;he di&s;covered a degree of anger and re&s;entment that I thought her gentle &s;pirit incapable of feeling upon any provocation; but as this was the mere upon of offended mode&s;ty, which I had not meant to offend, I thought my&s;elf almo&s;t &s;ure of appea&s;ing it. I a&s;&s;ured her with great truth, that I had taken effectual means to guard again&s;t a con&s;equence which had &s;hocked her imaginati|on &s;o much; and that, &s;o far from being really guilty of any intended offence to her delicacy, I was ready at that in&s;tant to pay it perhaps the highe&s;t compliment that was ever offered to that mo&s;t amiable quality in woman, that if &s;he would only permit the excellent Mr. Danvers to read the &s;ervice to us, I would allow her, the mo|ment it was ended, to bani&s;h me to any part of the globe, and for any period &s;he plea&s;ed&mdash;I would never claim her as my wife till the very hour arrived that &s;he &s;hould her&s;elf appoint. I &s;aid much on this topic, and with a romantic tenderne&s;s and &s;incerity that entirely bani&s;hed her re&s;entment. She appeared indeed &s;o much &s;oftened, that my reverend ally, conceiving fre&s;h hopes, began to renew his &s;upplication; but, before he could fini&s;h a &s;ingle &s;entence, a mo&s;t deep and terrific &s;igh bur&s;t from her heart, and &s;he exclaimed, "O Danvers, Danvers, is it po&s;&s;ible that you can de&s;ert me! then Heaven is my only refuge; and Heaven in&s;pire me for my defence!" De&s;ert you, Madam! cried the high &s;pirited though &s;imple Danvers, much galled by her expre&s;&s;ion, Heaven is my witne&s;s, that I never yet de&s;erted man, woman, or child, in any kind of di&s;tre&s;s; and you, my dear Ma|dam, would be the la&s;t per&s;on in the world to|wards

As Danvers was going out of the room, &s;he had de&s;ired him to order her chai&s;e; and though the old man, in a broken voice, had begged her to &s;tay the night, &s;he pe|remptorily refu&s;ed, and pre&s;&s;ed for the carriage immediately.

<P>My perver&s;e &s;tars &s;eem to be determined that I &s;hall no more enjoy any plea&s;ures of a more chearful and tender &s;ort.

Judge, Edmund, of my bitter blank vexation, when, in&s;tead of the friendly faces of the good Seignor Pinelli and his lovely daugh|ter, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound only a poor old woman, who told me, in words that &s;ounded more di&s;mal to my ear than ever human voice did before, that the family were all gone to vi&s;it a relation in the

neighbourhood of Rome; that they talked of extending their excur&s;ion to Venice; and per|haps they might travel &s;till farther before they returned. I feel di&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue them round the world; for I have lo&s;t all reli&s;h for common &s;ociety; my feelings and affections &s;eem to be half-pal&s;ied; and I have, I think, no de&s;ire alive, except a pa&s;&s;ionate, yet, believe me, not an amorous de&s;ire, to &s;ee and conver&s;e with Giuliana.</P>
<P>As to my &s;olicitude concerning the &s;anctified Cornelia, it grows le&s;s and le&s;s, in proportion as I &s;uffer more and more from her &s;aintly pride. A woman who can &s;o triumphantly command her affections will never &s;uffer much from the ab&s;ence of any man, however dear to her he in his hours of vanity may &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EDMUND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE joy that I felt in returning to my own comfortable hou&s;e, from the de&s;olate man&s;ion of poor Verney, has been grievou&s;ly damped, by the clouds of trouble in which I found my good Harriot involved: her generous anxiety for my quiet had kept me, till I returned, a perfect &s;tranger to all the late vexatious occurrences. I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly grieved to find that my pro|phetic fears of your precipitate, yet &s;till intere&s;t|ing friend, have been &s;o painfully realized. I am &s;till more anxious, if po&s;&s;ible, than ever, to &s;ave him from him&s;elf, the wor&s;t of all enemies; and indeed the only enemy, as I think you once told him, that he has to fear. Our incompara|ble Cornelia has behaved, I under&s;tand, like an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el, in a trial infinitely too &s;evere for a frame to delicate.

<P>I own to you, that her countenance alarms me for her life, though her attentive and quick-&s;ighted
<PB N="116" REF="118">
friend Harriot a&s;&s;ures me that her ap|pearance is greatly mended within the la&s;t fort|night, and is confident in the hope of her per|fect recovery. In &s;ome private conver&s;ation which I have had with the lovely &s;ufferer, &s;he has affected me with more compa&s;&s;ion, I think, than I ever felt for a human creature before. Though &s;he is un&s;haken in her opinion as to the religious rectitude of her conduct, and though &s;he was highly gratified by the hearty and af|fectionate applau&s;e that I be&s;towed on her mater|nal virtue; yet an ince&s;&s;ant dread that her re|jection of Seymour may hurry this impetuous young man into tho&s;e vices from which he was uncommonly free, preys upon her heart. She expre&s;&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions to me in language &s;o eloquent and pathetic that &s;he made me feel them in all their force, while I laboured with little &s;ucce&s;s to in&s;pire her with more chearful expectations. Indeed her fears are too well grounded: there is nothing, I think, more to be dreaded than the fiery &s;pirit of a young man who has failed in any plan of virtuous happine&s;s. A revolt to the powers of vice, in the&s;e ca&s;es, is frequent, I believe, in every rank of life; for mo&s;t mortals, who mean hone&s;tly, think they have &s;uch a right to be happy, that when they find their good moral projects produce not this effect, they ha&s;tily conclude that the world is governed by chance, and are content to follow a guide and ruler who, thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h allowed to be blind, is &s;uppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to be irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>

<P>On my arrival here, I felt not a little cha|grined in finding only the good old aunt of Giu|liana, to who&s;e hou&s;e I had been directed.&mdash; My friends of Genoa are again on the wing; but they are expected here in about three weeks; and this very polite old lady pre&s;&s;ed me mo&s;t cordially, when &s;he heard my name, to await under her ho&s;pitable roof the return of her rela|tions. This I declined as civilly as I could, promi&s;ing to be with her again at the time &s;he mentioned; and, chu&s;ing to pa&s;s the interim at liberty, to amu&s;e my&s;elf in excur&s;ions to Rome, and in any fanciful pur&s;uits that the intere&s;ting &s;cene around me could &s;ugge&s;t. But chance &s;oon threw in my way a magnet more attrac|tive than the politene&s;s of my old lady. In re|turning to my inn from her hou&s;e, which &s;tands at a little di&s;tance from this plea&s;ant town, I pa&s;&s;ed another &s;ingle hou&s;e, with a &s;mall but charming garden, on the &s;lope of this chearful hill. At the door of this hou&s;e &s;tood a &s;plendid carriage, and ju&s;t as I reached it an elderly man of a dignified appearance leaped into it, with eyes that &s;parkled with fury, and was driven rapidly towards Rome. This circum&s;tance led me to ca&s;t a curious eye round the hou&s;e he had ju&s;t left; and at an upper window, which look|ed obliquely upon me, becau&s;e it was within the garden-wall, I beheld the mo&s;t fa&s;cinating of all &s;ights, a young and beautiful female in tears. Our eyes met, and &s;eemed to under&s;tand each other. As there happened to be nobody near me, I &s;tood gazing on the lovely &s;tranger, not with looks of impertinent curio&s;ity, but of
<PB N="120" REF="122">
the mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ion. I endeavoured to explain to her, by ge&s;ture, my very ardent de|&s;ire to aleviate her affliction. She made a &s;ig|nal, in return, which &s;eemed to bid me wait; and di&s;appeared from the window. My hear: was now thrown into all the tumultuous &s;en&s;a|tions of fond &s;olicitude and &s;u&s;pen&s;e. I looked anxiou&s;ly to the window, and &s;oon beheld the beauty who had vani&s;hed returning, like the &s;un, with increa&s;ing lu&s;tre. Though her &s;itua|tion rendered it difficult to convey any thing to me, becau&s;e, as I have told you, the garden-wall was between us, &s;he contrived to throw, with great force and dexterity, a circular billet at my feet; for the dear ingenious creature, to make her paper heavy enough to reach me, had wrapped it round a &s;ilver medal of the Pope. I was charmed with her contrivance; and you mu&s;t not pretend, my dear monitor, to reprove me, &s;ince you &s;ee that our loves commence un|der the guidance of his Holine&s;s.&mdash;What &s;trange things happen in this odd world! and how little did I ever expect to ki&s;s the image of a Roman Pontiff with more than Catholic de|votion! Yet this I now did, as the mo&s;t expre&s;|&s;ive an&s;wer that I could give on the &s;pot to the tender inviting billet which the Holy Father had &s;o faithfully wa&s;ted to my hand. This billet was written with great &s;pirit, and in good Itali|an. It &s;aid, "that if I had &s;en&s;ibility and cou|rage enough to venture through many dangers, to hear and pity the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of an oppre&s;&s;ed and unfortunate girl, I &s;hould take my &s;tation at midnight near a door at the bottom of the &s;loping garden, and a very tru&s;ty old woman would lead me to the per&s;on for whom I had ap|peared
<PB N="121" REF="123">
to feel &s;o much generous and con&s;olato|ry compa&s;&s;ion." Here was a temptation, my dear cautious philo&s;opher, which I think even your di&s;creet wor&s;hip could not have re&s;i&s;ted, e&s;pecially had you heard, as I did at my inn, that the hou&s;e to which I was &s;o enchantingly invit|ed had been lately taken by a whim&s;ical old no|bleman of Portugal, a Don Manoel Coutinho, who is de&s;cribed as half a great genius and half a madman: he is a Scholar, an Antiquary, a Medalli&s;t, a Fencer, a Fidler, a Mechanic, a Chemi&s;t, and, above all, a Voluptuary. He has been in all parts of the world, and &s;peaks all languages. The accounts I hear of him put me in mind of the Scotti&s;h wonder, the admirable Creichton, and of our Wortley Montague: he &s;eems to be a compound of tho&s;e two extraordi|nary characters; and if report &s;ays true, he un|der&s;tands every thing, except how to confer hap|pine&s;s on a young and beautiful girl:
<Q>Though not a &s;cience, fairly worth the &s;even.</Q></P>
<P>However the enterprizing and univer&s;al Don Manoel thought him&s;elf equal to this branch of knowledge, as he lately brought off from Ve|nice a young creature, who may be ju&s;tly rec|koned the mo&s;t con&s;ummate model of voluptu|ous beauty that Nature ever exhibited, even in the country where &s;he is mo&s;t lavi&s;h of tho&s;e al|luring exhibitions. Such was the report, my dear Edmund, that I heard of my fair <HI>incognito</HI> and her tyrant, who is &s;o barbarou&s;ly jealous of his lovely trea&s;ure that he keeps hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> like a &s;tate-pri&s;oner; and yet is &s;o vain of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mharms, that once, they &s;ay, he wanted to di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y them in
<PB N="122" REF="124">
the condition of a new created Eve, to a &s;et of licentious and half-intoxicated gue&s;ts at his ta|ble. The beautiful Venetian, who&s;e name is Violante, and who, in &s;pite of a villainous edu|cation, is truly more mode&s;t than vain, revolt|ed again&s;t this propo&s;al; and has been more bar|barou&s;ly treated, in con&s;equence of a virtue which a voluptuary more refined than the old tyrannical Portugue&s;e would have con&s;idered as her capital charm. You will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, my dear Edmund, that, as my fancy was inflamed by this hi&s;tory, I flew with ardour to my a&s;&s;ig|nation. I will &s;pare both you and my&s;elf a re|lation of the unplea&s;ant and humiliating &s;teps that I was forced to take, to reach in &s;afety the apartment of my charmer; and only briefly &s;ay, that, after pa&s;&s;ing through the darkne&s;s of Tartarus, I was at la&s;t very happily u&s;hered in|to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly&s;ium. I mu&s;t not, however be &s;uch a hy|pocrite as to in&s;inuate, that the joys I found here were all of the &s;piritual kind. No, my dear philo&s;opher, it was a &s;cene that would have annihilated the continence of a Scipio. Repre|&s;ent to your&s;elf a young beauty, not yet eigh|teen, more exqui&s;itely, more voluptuou&s;ly fa&s;hi|oned, in voice, in feature, in form, than any girl that your eyes ever beheld; repre&s;ent her provoked by an old tyrant who had ab&s;olutely beat her, and plea&s;ed by a young adventurer who had freely hazarded his life for the plea&s;ure of &s;oothing her affliction. The lovely creature was not ungrateful. But I will not tantalife your philo&s;ophy, by any glowing de&s;criptions of the tran&s;cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntly beautiful and extatic Violante. Nor is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> per&s;on alone that I am charmed with; &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as a heart, mind, and &s;oul, fully

equal to her exqui&s;ite form. My cautious mo|nitor will tell me, that I can be no judge of the&s;e in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as I view them all through a very illu&s;ive medium. Granted, my dear philo&s;opher; yet, as our friend Prior &s;ays:
<Q><L>Howe'er, 'tis well that while mankind</L>
<L>In Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">'s perver&s;e meander errs,</L>
<L>We can imagin'd plea&s;ures find,</L>
<L>To combat again&s;t real care.</L></Q></P>
<P>At all events, Violante is too good for the old barbarian who has her now in his power; and I have &s;ome un&s;ettled thoughts of contriving her e&s;cape, and tran&s;porting her to England. What &s;ay you my dear Edmund? will you receive the admirable creature as a new tenant for your emp|ty cottage? &s;he is not, I confe&s;s, &s;o angelic as Giuliana; but &s;he has her merits, believe me, and her failings are only &s;uch as ari&s;e from her cruel de&s;tiny, and not from her natural charac|ter. But it would be no ea&s;y matter to accom|pli&s;h her freedom. The old Don is a fellow of de&s;perate vigilance and dexterity. He might, indeed, have made an excellent magician in darker times; for Violante &s;hewed me many wonderful &s;pecimens of his rare &s;kill both in me|chani&s;m and chemi&s;try. She reckons him little le&s;s than an ab&s;olute conjuror, and has therefore I believe, double delight in out-witting him. Nothing is &s;o dangerous as an attempt to go|vern a woman by cunning; it always provokes her to &s;oil her governor with his own weapons. Violante, I believe, would be the mo&s;t open-hearted and faithful creature in the world to a man who treated her with kindne&s;s and confi|dence.
<PB N="124" REF="126">
But you &s;hall hear more of her as we grow more intimate. We &s;hall have frequent opportunities to cultivate our acquaintance, be|cau&s;e the old Seignior pa&s;&s;es two or three nights every week, in Rome, where he is reported to be carrying on many deep and &s;ecret machinati|ons. He has certainly &s;ome private rea&s;on for not taking Violante with him; and he leaves her under the guard of an old tru&s;ty Portugueze &s;ecretary, uncommonly devoted to the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter, who delivered him from the gripe of the Inqui&s;ition; a benefit, indeed, that ought never to be forgotten; and I &s;hall not therefore attempt to corrupt this dependant, tru&s;ty Argus, as he is. I have luckily eluded his eyes, and may contrive perhaps hereafter to bear off the trea&s;ure that he is commi&s;&s;ioned to watch. However this may be, take care, I be&s;eech you, that the private hi&s;tory I now &s;end you may never reach the ear of Cornelia; for, if &s;he retains any great affection for me, which I can hardly &s;up|po&s;e, I &s;hould be &s;orry &s;o mortify and in&s;ult is. Fooli&s;h, ob&s;tinate bigot! what would I not have given, to have made her as happy for life, as I made for &s;ome hours the more beautiful, yet &s;till le&s;s attractive, Violante! Deuce take this invo|luntary reflection! it has half-poi&s;oned my rap|tures, pa&s;t and to come: and &s;ince my &s;pleen is thus unexpectedly awakened, the kinde&s;t thing, my dear Edmund, that I can do by you is, to bid you abruptly farewell.

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. FROM MISS TO MR. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was &s;urely a good angel who &s;ugge&s;ted to you the idea of recommending to our dear Ed|mund an immediate excur&s;ion to Genoa. I mo&s;t cordially hope that he will embark for that excur&s;ion before many days elap&s;e, and not &s;o much for the friendly purpo&s;e which you have in view, as to alleviate his own particular di&s;|tre&s;s; for I grieve to tell you, that he is at the moment one of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beings that you ever beheld. A dreadful incident has hap|pened in our neighbourhood, which, though I tru&s;t it will ultimately be the means of giving tranquillity to his life, has affected him &s;o deep|ly in the in&s;tant, that he is utterly incapable of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ting even to you. Indeed, my nerves have been as much &s;haken as his; but, as my heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le&s;s concerned, I have greatly recovered my|&s;elf, and &s;hall ha&s;ten to relieve you from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m which this opening of my letter will, I know, occa&s;ion in you and our dear &s;ympathe|tic Harriot.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">Though you are both of a nature too noble to pry into the &s;ecrets which decency and di&s;cre|tion would keep as much as po&s;&s;ible out of &s;ight, I know, by &s;light hints which have fallen from you both, that you are apprized of what our dear Edmund wi&s;hed to think an impenetrable my&s;tery, revealed only to me: I mean, his long and incorrigible indulgence in the plea|&s;ures of illicit love. Alas! how heavy a price is paid for tho&s;e plea&s;ures, even by the &s;ex which is &s;uppo&s;ed to obtain them on the mo&s;t ea&s;y and advantageous terms! To our poor af|flicted Edmund they have proved, what I fancy they prove to mo&s;t men, a very unquiet dream, ending abruptly in a &s;tart of horror. But to my mournful &s;tory: As death, the great di&s;co|verer of latent foibles, has now utterly torn in pieces the half-tattered veil of &s;ecrecy, I am at full liberty to tell you, that the unhappy though alluring object of Edmund's clande&s;tine attach|ment was a beautiful girl of this country; &s;he was the daughter of a reputable farmer; but, like mo&s;t of the farmers' daughters in our days, &s;he was little occcupied in the &s;alutary labours of ru&s;tic life. The univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion for dre&s;s and &s;entiment very early &s;eized on this lively dam&s;el: in&s;tead of carrying her butter and eggs to the neighbouring market town, &s;he ne|ver went thither but to purcha&s;e gauze, and cram her pocket with novels from the circulat|ing-library. From the&s;e &s;he &s;oon learned to con&s;ider Love as the only bu&s;ine&s;s of life; and thus di&s;po&s;ed, about ten years ago &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon Edmund. He re&s;embled the hero of her favourite romance: &s;he contrived to throw her&s;elf alone in his way in a &s;weet &s;hady lane;
<PB N="127" REF="129">
one romantic &s;tep led to another; and, after a few &s;entimental meetings, the &s;ad old &s;en&s;ual and common cata&s;trophe en&s;ued. The only ex|traordinary part of their amorous hi&s;tory is this: although the poor idle girl, whom Ed|mund di&s;tingui&s;hed by the whim&s;ical title of Syl|via, made the fir&s;t overtures, &s;he has been in|violably faithful, though extremely capricious, in a connexion of many years: yet their inter|cour&s;e has been attended with a &s;ufficiency of troubles. The u&s;ual mi&s;chief happened very early; and poor Edmund, who has naturally a tender con&s;cience, was half-di&s;tracted with the idea of de&s;troying the peace of an hone&s;t un|&s;u&s;pecting father: but Providence prevented the &s;cene of paternal angu&s;h, which had terrified the imagination of the two delinquents. The old farmer fini&s;hed his days without &s;u&s;pecting the condition of his child. Poor Sylvia had no mother; and by the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an aunt (the humble widow of an humble Divine) &s;he avoided public di&s;grace, and produced a daughter, which Edmund has reared with the utmo&s;t privacy, and only vi&s;ited as mi&s;ers vi&s;it their hidden gold.</P>
<P>After the birth of this lovely infant, he re&s;olved to break the connexion; but, philo&s;opher as he calls him&s;elf, he found that this project, though &s;trongly recommended both by virtue and pru|dence, was much ea&s;ier in theory than in prac|tice. Sylvia, more beautiful and more fond than ever, &s;ettled her&s;elf with her aunt in a neat, little, retired hou&s;e, but a very few miles from us. Humanity required that Edmund &s;hould &s;ometimes carry her accounts of the child, whom &s;he was allowed to &s;ee very rarely, and by
<PB N="128" REF="130">
&s;tealth. Alas! this humanity, my dear Audley, with mortals le&s;s virtuous or le&s;s happy than you are, is apt to lead them, even with their eyes open, into &s;ad follies; it led our dear brother to hamper him&s;elf more and more in this attach|ment, which he clearly &s;aw was unfriendly to his comfort, his tranquillity, his reputation. Fortunately no new incumbrances aro&s;e in the &s;hape of children: at times many good re&s;oluti|ons were formed, but frailty, pa&s;&s;ion, and ha|bit, prevailed again&s;t them. Spin&s;ter as I am, I feel my&s;elf a little bound to argue, as far as I decently may, in extenuation of our dear Ed|mund's frailty; becau&s;e I really believe that I have been, though very innocently, in&s;trumen|tal to its continuance. I believe his very kind de&s;ire to &s;ooth my troubled mind, and to give me a hou&s;e to manage, when I was &s;o bitterly di&s;appointed of one that I expected to call my own, prevented his thinking &s;eriou&s;ly of a wife at the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on, and of cour&s;e had a tendency to prolong his re&s;tle&s;s bondage, under the half-tender and half-tyrannical Sylvia.&mdash; However this may be, they have maintained a &s;ecret intercour&s;e for &s;everal years, in which their di&s;quietude and their vexation have far ex|ceeded their tenderne&s;s and their plea&s;ure, if I may credit the poor frail philo&s;opher, who, for my edification, confe&s;&s;es to me all his weakne&s;s, though he will &s;eldom follow my &s;age advice. At la&s;t, indeed, he had re&s;olved on a thorough reform. Tired to death of the &s;pleen, and di&s;con|tent of his way ward and querulous Sylvia, he had exhorted her to &s;ettle in a mode of life who&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="131">
advantages &s;he would often enumerate with en|vy. He was ready to &s;acrifice his own plea&s;ure to her happine&s;s, or her tranquillity: &s;he might marry whenever &s;he cho&s;e it; and his genero|&s;ity would facilitate that event. After a million of debates, bitter &s;quabbles, and tender recon|ciliations, on this wide field of argument, all things were at length adju&s;ted; and poor Syl|via, to improve her temper, was to be con|&s;igned to a hu&s;band. She had an ardent ad|mirer in her own rank of life, who, being frankly informed of her part life, very gene|rou&s;ly per&s;evered in his addre&s;&s;es; the day of marriage was appointed, an event that filled me, I confe&s;s, with &s;trange mingled &s;en&s;ations of gladne&s;s and terror; of gladne&s;s, becau&s;e I had long wi&s;hed to &s;ee the poor enthralled Ed|mund &s;et free; and of terror, becau&s;e I clearly perceive, that, although his rea&s;on rejoiced in the pro&s;pect of this freedom, his pa&s;&s;ions were in &s;uch a &s;tate that they might induce him to &s;purn the ble&s;&s;ing in the very moment when he &s;eemed to have &s;ecured it. While affairs were in this anxious &s;ituation, our whole country was a&s;&s;embled at the great fair in our neigh|bourhood. &mdash;Sylvia attended her de&s;tined hu&s;|band, young Evans, to this motley &s;cene of bu&s;ine&s;s and merriment. As neither Edmund nor I wi&s;hed to be there, we intended to remain comfortably at home, and give the &s;ervants an opportunity of enjoying the gay &s;pectacle by them&s;elves. A me&s;&s;age from our neighbour Mrs. Clayfield di&s;concerted our quiet plan. Be|ing confined her&s;elf by indi&s;po&s;ition, and her hu&s;band being abroad; &s;he reque&s;ted me to take
<PB N="130" REF="132">
her daughter Charlotte to the puppet-&s;how. Edmund, who&s;e good-nature is always ready to gratify a child, ordered our [chai&s;e, and rode with me and my happy little charge to the fair. We were all not a little mortified to find our|&s;elves too late; the booth of exhibition was &s;o crammed that it could not even admit another infantine &s;pectator. Poor little Charlotte began to cry at the di&s;appointment; but &s;oon dried and forgot her tears, on being told, that the puppet-&s;how would begin again before it was time for us to go home, and then &s;he might de|pend on &s;eeing it. It was indeed a providen|tial ble&s;&s;ing to us that we were not admitted among the fir&s;t audience. The ma&s;ter of this canvas theatre, to collect the more money, had built &s;omething like boxes, and an upper gal|lery; but this &s;tructure was &s;o ha&s;tily and ill prepared, and &s;o overloaded, that part of it gave way. As we were &s;auntering about a hundred yards from the great booth, we heard a mo&s;t horrible outcry, and &s;oon beheld &s;everal men and women ru&s;hing forth in great con&s;ternation. The fir&s;t report was, that many per&s;ons were cru&s;hed to death by a fall of the &s;caffolding. Edmund in&s;tantly put me and the child into the chai&s;e, and begged us to wait while he ran to enquire into the real extent of the calamity. Think, Audley, what our dear brother's agony mu&s;t have been, when he found that the fir&s;t unhappy &s;ufferer brought forth from the ruins was poor Evans, hideou&s;ly disfigured and quite dead. Edmund plunged, as he has &s;ince told me, with a frantic impul&s;e, into the croud, and over&s;et &s;ome of the per&s;ons employed in bring|ing
<PB N="131" REF="133">
out a female figure; it was poor Sylvia, with a frame mo&s;t deplorably &s;hattered and al|mo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s; yet &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her &s;en&s;es; and at the &s;ight of Edmund fa&s;tened one hand (which was all &s;he could move) upon him, with a &s;hri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of angui&s;h and affection. He brought her to the chai&s;e, and having with great diffi|culty got her into it, and offered a reward to any man who could mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly bring a &s;urgeon to the hou&s;e of her aunt, he placed him&s;elf by the &s;ide of the poor half-expiring &s;ufferer, and drove from us, promi&s;ing to &s;end the chai&s;e back immediately for Charlotte and me: for this, however, we did not wait; as a friend of Mrs. Clayfield's conveyed both the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ld and me to our re&s;pective homes. I now pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours of the mo&s;t melancholy &s;olici|tude and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, wi&s;hing to do every thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the be&s;t, and yet doing nothing, for fear of doing wrong. At la&s;t the chai&s;e returned, with a reque&s;t from Edmund, that it might bring me immediately to him. You will ea&s;ily be|lieve that I felt no prudi&s;h &s;cruples at &s;uch a moment. I could willingly have &s;acrificed re|putation to alleviate the horrid &s;ufferings of this poor dying creature. But, alas! I had not the mournful &s;atisfaction of finding her alive. The &s;urgeon and I were both too late. I found my brother in the fonde&s;t agonies of grief, and pre&s;&s;ing in his arms the breathle&s;s object of his love. Yet my arrival afforded him great re|lief. He ro&s;e eagerly, to tell me with what ad|mirable expre&s;&s;ions of piety and affection the haple&s;s girl had expired. She ble&s;&s;ed GOD, he &s;aid, that poor Evans had &s;uffered none of tho&s;e
<PB N="132" REF="134">
bodily tortures which had fallen ju&s;tly on her. She con&s;idered the dreadful event as ordained by Providence to &s;ave that worthy young man from much impending mi&s;ery, and her&s;elf per|haps from much guilt; for &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, that, although &s;he had con&s;ented to the marriage, &s;he had found her heart and &s;oul indi&s;&s;olubly at|tached to Edmund. She conjured him to che|ri&s;h her child; and, above all things, to give her &s;uch an education, however humble, as may be&s;t &s;ecure her from following the fatal example of her unhappy mother. You will readily conceive with what tenderne&s;s our gen|tle Edmund replied to the&s;e heart-piercing en|treaties. He a&s;&s;ured the tender expiring parent, that I &s;hould prove a mo&s;t attentive and affec|tionate mother to the dear orphan Fanny (the name of their daughter). At this idea, he &s;ays, her bodily angui&s;h &s;eemed quite &s;u&s;pended, and &s;he an&s;wered him in a tender tran&s;port. "Oh, my dear Edmund, I can believe any goodne&s;s in tho&s;e who are related to you! If your &s;i&s;ter, though I have not de&s;erved &s;uch an honour, would but comfort my parting &s;pirit with &s;uch a promi&s;e from her own lips, my death would be a ble&s;&s;ed one indeed!" It was in con&s;equence of this &s;peech than Edmund &s;ent immediately for me; but, alas! as I have al|ready told you, I came too late; the little re|maining &s;trength of the fond &s;ufferer was ex|hau&s;ted by her impa&s;&s;ioned di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cour&s;e with Ed|mund; and, after conjuring him mo&s;t tender|ly and repeatedly to her la&s;t ga&s;p to love the poor little Fanny, and to think more of Hea|ven,

<P>The good old woman, with whom this un|happy girl had long re&s;ided, is too far advanc|ed into &s;econd childhood to feel this horrible event with very poignant angui&s;h. But on our dear feeling Edmund it has made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. It was with the outmo&s;t difficulty that I could per&s;uade him to quit the apartment of the decea&s;ed; and when I had drawn him from it I could not prevent his returning, to gaze with in&s;atiated grief on that lifele&s;s frame which he had idolized, though not with a hap|py, yet with a vehement, affection. At my intreaty, however, he at length forced him&s;elf from the hou&s;e, though not before the dawn of a new day; and it was between five and &s;ix ye&s;terday morning before we reached our own door. Since that time I have been greatly re|fre&s;hed by much comfortable &s;leep; a ble&s;&s;ing which our dear afflicted Edmund has not enjoy|ed: his mind, however, is as calm as I could expect it to be; his health, I tru&s;t, not mate|rially injured; though his nerves are at pre&s;ent in a painful agitation. At one time he talks of flying immediately to the &s;chool of his poor lit|tle Fanny, and of bringing the child home di|rectly: at another, he thinks him&s;elf not able to &s;upport the &s;ight of her at pre&s;ent; and I think he &s;eems mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to follow the &s;ug|ge&s;tion of your kind letter, which arrived the day before this dreadful event, and to join his friend Seymour abroad, leaving me to take care of his little Fanny, which you will readily be|lieve I have promi&s;ed to do to the utmo&s;t of my

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY VERY DEAR EDMUND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ju&s;t folding up the inclo&s;ed letter, which I had written to your friend Seymour, in the hope of its travelling to him in your port|manteau, when I was &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked by the melancholy account of your recent di&s;tre&s;s. Believe me, we &s;ympathi&s;e mo&s;t cordially in your &s;orrow. Whatever failings may have be|longed to the dear unhappy girl you have lo&s;t, they are out-weighed in our imagination by the force and fidelity of her affection to you; and I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, both in Harriot's name and my own, that you may &s;end your intere&s;ting little Fanny at any time to us, and depend on our treating her exactly as a child of our own. If you approve our &s;y&s;tem of dome&s;tic education and if Lucy will re&s;ign to us a charge &s;o pre|cious, we &s;hall be happy to enlarge our infan|tine circle by &s;uch an acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>As to your&s;elf, my dear brother, I can per|fectly enter into all the various trouble of heart and mind in which you have been &s;o &s;uddenly involved. To behold the calamitous de&s;truction
<PB N="136" REF="138">
of a lovely being, by whom you knew your&s;elf beloved, though "Not wi&s;ely, yet too well," mu&s;t make an impre&s;&s;ion on your feeling &s;pirit too forcible to be counteracted by any vain con|doleance or con&s;olation. The very &s;ailings of the dear departed mu&s;t have a tendency to en|crea&s;e the fond vehemence of recent grief. It is &s;urely natural for you to think with the more tenderne&s;s of her affection, from reflecting on the &s;evere price &s;he paid for its indulgence. Alas, how full of bitterne&s;s is the ordinary lot of women! Your poor Sylvia, never happy even with you, would have been a wretch in|deed in that &s;tate from which the mercy of Pro|vidence has &s;natched her. The religious point of view in which the fond dying girl beheld her own de&s;tiny, has endeared her memory to me; and the child &s;he has &s;o anxiou&s;ly recommended to your care will be an invaluable beque&s;t, if &s;he &s;erves, as I tru&s;t the will, to retrace and perpe|tuate on your heart the affectionate le&s;&s;on of pie|ty beque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thed to you by the lips of her expiring mother.</P>
<P>Overwhelmed as you mu&s;t have been, my dear Edmund, by this heart-piercing &s;cene, I &s;till hope that you will &s;oon be able to recover the natural tranquillity of your cultivated mind, and that you will &s;peedily pur&s;ue the project of foreign excur&s;ion. Nothing can be more me|dicinal to the angui&s;h of afflicted love than to force your&s;elf with a generous ardour, into the immediate &s;ervice of friend&s;hip. Indeed, little force will be nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion, as I am per&s;uaded that no &s;elfi&s;h &s;orrow can dimini&s;h your anxiety for the perils of a friend &s;o ju&s;tly dear to you as Seymour. You will perceive,

by the inclo&s;ed, that I am greatly alarmed for him my&s;elf: no youth, indeed, can more truly want a Mentor in his travels, than this accom|pli&s;hed, but ha&s;ty young man; e&s;pecially &s;ince his natural impetuo&s;ity is inflamed and exa&s;pe|rated, by a di&s;appointment which his high pa&s;|&s;ions are &s;o little able to brook.

<HEAD>LETTER XX. FROM MR. AUDLEY TO SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear ha&s;ty young friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON my return from a di&s;tant and melancho|ly expedition, I was a&s;toni&s;hed and grieved to hear that you have driven your&s;elf to the Conti|nent, in&s;tead of returning, as I hoped you would a contented and welcome gue&s;t to this hou&s;e. I do not, my dear Seymour, write with an angry pen, to upbraid you for what is pa&s;t; nor to remind you of the hopes you gave me, that you were re&s;olved to pur&s;ue a very different line of conduct. I know how apt we all are to forget our rational re&s;olutions; and one of our old cla&s;&s;ical acquaintance has particularly taught me, not to require rea&s;on and method from the madne&s;s of love. On your late mea&s;ures I will trouble you with no remarks! but allow me to ca&s;t a friend|ly eye to the future. Some meditations on hu|man nature have induced me to think that of all traitors an ardent affection like yours, my en|gaging ra&s;h friend, is the greate&s;t and mo&s;t pe|rilous traitor to it&s;elf: on being thwarted in a point which it too vehemently pur&s;ues, it is apt to draw conclu&s;ions unwarranted by truth, and
<PB N="139" REF="141">
directly oppo&s;ite to its own intere&s;t. Dive into your own bo&s;om for an illu&s;tration of my remark and tell me ingenuou&s;ly, if you have not frequent|ly concluded that Cornelia has no real love for you, becau&s;e &s;he did not comply with your late importunate and too cruel reque&s;t. The chief purpo&s;e of my letter is, to pre&s;erve you from a natural &s;elf-deception in this very important ar|ticle. Believe me, I &s;peak the language of &s;trict truth, and of &s;teady, though offended friend&s;hip, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that the female heart never felt affection more genuine and inten&s;e than the affection which the de&s;olate Cornelia &s;till retains for you. Though her rea&s;on and religion en|joined and enabled her to decide again&s;t you, in your late conte&s;t; yet the agonies of heart which that angelic victory co&s;t her threw her life into great danger. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted in a manner to merit the approba|tion of heaven and earth, has proved the mo&s;t effectual medicine in re&s;toring her to that de|gree of tranquillity and half-recovered health, which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at pre&s;ent. The love, which has cea&s;ed to convul&s;e her heart, &s;till exi&s;ts un|dimini&s;hed in her bo&s;om, and is become, in|deed, &s;o much a part of her exi&s;tence, that whatever your de&s;tiny may be, &s;he, I am con|vinced, will never attach her&s;elf to any other man. The heart of Cornelia was formed to love only once: you have been, and ever mu&s;t be, the only object of its tender idolatry; and your generous &s;pirit ought to admire and applaud the divine fortitude with which &s;he endures to &s;acri|fice even this idol to her GOD.&mdash;But, alas! my dear Seymour, it has been your misfortune, as it is the misfortune of thou&s;ands at your age,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
and in your rank of life, to look on piety either with contempt or compa&s;&s;ion&punc; as it has proved an inpediment to your de&s;ires, you will be tempted to con&s;ider it with peculiar &s;pleen and inju&s;tice. There are times, I dare &s;ay, when the piety of your accompli&s;hed and beloved Cor|nelia appears to you a mo&s;t degrading infirmity; the mark of a poor, a timid, and feeble mind, though in truth it is exactly the rever&s;e. Be|lieve me, her piety is of that genuine kind which elevates the under&s;tanding and ennobles the heart. By uniting with the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t powerful of all natural &s;entiments, I mean, her maternal affection, it gives a tran&s;cendant charm to her character; and makes her at once, per|haps, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and mo&s;t perfect of human creatures; with all the &s;oftne&s;s of wo|man, and all the energy of a &s;aint. I wi&s;h, my dear friend, that I had the power of convey|ing to you, in the mo&s;t vivid colours of elo|quence, a complete idea of all her merit, all her loveline&s;s, all her affection; not to exa&s;perate your regret for a trea&s;ure you have lo&s;t, but to awaken you to an early ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of what it is &s;till very po&s;&s;ible for you to acquire. However angry and unju&s;t towards her you may feel at pre&s;ent, a day will &s;urely come (and it is the wi&s;h or my heart to accelerate that day), when the conduct of Cornelia will appear to you as lovely as her per&s;on: it is impo&s;&s;ible that a &s;pirit like yours (however mortified and offended) can meditate on &s;uch a woman with long and un|relenting inju&s;tice; for had not education, in|dulgence, and fa&s;hion, given a fatal bias to your mind, believe me, it would have been in all points the counterpart of Cornelia's. I never
<PB N="141" REF="143">
beheld a couple in my life whom nature &s;eemed to have fa&s;hioned more happily for each other, or whom time and chance had united in a more ardent affection. You have both the &s;ame ex|qui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, the &s;ame openne&s;s of heart, the &s;ame generous abhorrence, not only of eve|ry thing that is mean, but of every thing that borders upon meanne&s;s. In &s;hort, whenever I think of you, and that is not &s;eldom, you &s;trike me as the fir&s;t pair in the beautiful de&s;cription of Milton. How happy &s;hould I think my&s;elf in &s;eeing your nuptial couch prepared under the au&s;pices of heaven! I am per&s;uaded, my dear Seymour, that time and experience will &s;oon &s;hew you the emptine&s;s and in&s;tability of all en|joyments, which do not re&s;t on the ba&s;is of Re|ligion. If Providence, uniting with your own excellent under&s;tanding, &s;hould &s;peedily produce that happy change in your religious &s;entiments which I am &s;o eager to behold, pray let this let|ter &s;erve to remind you, that you will certainly find, under my cu&s;tody, perhaps the mo&s;t valu|able earthly reward which GOD can be&s;tow up|on any man for correcting the errors of his mind, a woman of exqui&s;ite attractions, and as full of purity and love as the religion &s;he profe&s;&s;es. Let me add, that when I &s;ee you entitled to this reward, it will be con&s;igned to you by a per&s;on who&s;e joy on the occa&s;ion will almo&s;t equal your own. Farewell and believe me</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. FROM EDMUND TO CHARLES AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are the be&s;t of brothers, and the mo&s;t indulgent of friends! How can I &s;ufficiently love and thank you, both on Seymour's account and my own? Alas! I am ill able to expre&s;s, at pre&s;ent, the double gratitude that I feel. Yet I mu&s;t thank you for your mo&s;t affectionate and &s;oothing letter, from the bottom of a heart very deeply, and, I confe&s;s, very fooli&s;hly afflicted. Ah, my dear Charles, I begin to conceive how much the balm which Religion admini&s;ters to a wounded &s;pirit, may be &s;uperior to all the boa&s;t|ed con&s;olations of philo&s;ophy. I vainly thought that I had di&s;ciplined my own quiet and con|templative mind in &s;uch a manner as to render it &s;uperior to the malice of accident; yet the event of a minute has thrown me into a di&s;or|der of heart and &s;pirit that I might blu&s;h to confe&s;s to any per&s;on le&s;s indulgent or le&s;s dear to me than you are. Good Heaven! of what little u&s;e and efficacy is the mere una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on of a creature, who vainly prides him&s;elf on his rationality! My rea&s;on has told me a thou&s;and times, that it is fooli&s;h to lament the death of an unhappy girl, who frequently &s;eem|ed
<PB N="143" REF="145">
to live only to torment me; yet, I own to you, her lo&s;s has affected me &s;o much, that in lo&s;ing this lovely tormentor I feel as if I had lo&s;t every thing which could reconcile me to life.&mdash; She was, indeed, a very extraordinary and en|chanting creature. To atone for a temper, per|haps the mo&s;t capricious and &s;elf-tormenting that ever exi&s;ted, &s;he had the &s;tronge&s;t natural under&s;tanding, and the mo&s;t pointed wit, that I ever met with in woman: a pretty and a &s;peak|ing countenance; a delicate body, &s;till more eloquent; and affections, who&s;e ardor was equal|led by their fidelity. Oh, my poor Sylvia! among all the infinite varieties of character which the &s;ex comprizes, <Q>I ne'er &s;hall look upon thy like again.</Q></P>
<P>But I de&s;erved to lo&s;e thee as I did, for being &s;o cold-hearted a wretch as to think of placing thee for life in the arms of that haple&s;s &s;imple fellow, who had not faculties to comprehend thy mo&s;t engaging attractions, nor &s;en&s;e to pity and correct thy &s;elf-tormenting infirmities! Oh my dear Charles, if there is (as you &s;o confi|dently and &s;o chearfully expect) a happier world to come after this, &s;urely &s;he will not be exclued|ed from its beatitude, who never di&s;covered, even to the eyes of a prejudiced inqui&s;itor, any failing that did not ari&s;e, either from a neg|lected education, or from organs too delicate|ly con&s;tructed. But I will endeavour to turn my thoughts from the dear lo&s;t object of my ve|ry turbulent and fatal love, to that poor little orphan whom &s;he has enjoined me to cheri&s;h with unblameable affection; the very tender and generous manner in which you &s;peak to

You will not doubt the warmth of my gratitude to you both on ths occa&s;ion, when you recollect how &s;eriou&s;ly I have ever thought of parental duties. If a tender vigilance is due from every father to his child, how doubly incumbent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this duty upon tho&s;e who have ra&s;hly introduc|ed their offspring into a world of trouble, un|der &s;uch a di&s;advantage as no heart, that is tru|ly parental, can think of, without the tremors of apprehen&s;ion, if not of &s;orrow! Heaven grant that my &s;weet little Fanny, who is indeed a very promi&s;ing child, may live to reward you, by her improvement, for the extreme kindne&s;s with which you &s;peak of her education! I con|&s;ign her with gratitude and confidence to my too equally dear and excellent &s;i&s;ters. Lucy &s;hall bring her to your hou&s;e as &s;oon as I am gone; but I cannot quit the kingdom without folding the dear little orphan once to my heart, though I am well aware that the angui&s;h of that moment will equal its delight. Her &s;chool lies in my way, and Lucy will attend me &s;o far. I am eager to be gone on every account, and particularly becau&s;e I have received &s;ome very alarming intelligence from our ra&s;h and ungovernable friend.&mdash;You will grieve to hear, that his ha&s;ty &s;pirit has driven him into the &s;nares of a Venetian courtezan, who lives with an old voluptuary of Portugal. He is &s;o captivated by this young &s;orcere&s;s, that perhaps his next letter may be too full of licentious rap|ture for a female eye to peru&s;e. At all events,

you will join with me in thinking that it is much better for us to keep our women in ab&s;o|lute ignorance of this perilous folly.

Ah, my dear happy Charles, had your brother and your friend been your equals in the&s;e invaluable qualities, their lives would have been le&s;s im|bittered than they have been, and I &s;hould mo&s;t probably have e&s;caped the double load which now pre&s;&s;es on the &s;pirits of</P>

<P>IF I have been, my dear &s;i&s;ter, as you have frequently told me, the great &s;upport and com|fort of your life, in a &s;ea&s;on when the powers of your own heart and mind de&s;erted you, how amply have you now repaid the affection|ate obligation! I have no words half expre&s;|&s;ive enough to tell you my grateful &s;en&s;e of the intelligent tenderne&s;s with which you treated my poor little &s;en&s;itive Fanny and her di&s;tract|ed father in our painful interview, and more painful &s;eparation.

But while I held my dear little weeping orphan in my arms, I felt as if all my life ought to be devoted &s;olely to her; and in the moment when I tore my&s;elf at la&s;t from her
<PB N="147" REF="149">
&s;weet little infantine embrace, my poor Sylvia, &s;eemed to die a &s;econd time. Ah! my dear Lucy, as I drove away from you both, I felt &s;uch bitter angui&s;h and drearine&s;s of &s;oul as no language can expre&s;s. It was not till the next day in my power to recover my rea&s;on enough to think of you as I ought, and to enjoy the re|flection that I had left my child happily di&s;po&s;ed to obey and love you, and &s;ecure of finding in your tenderne&s;s all the fond vigilance of a real mother. Heaven ble&s;s you both! and Heaven grant that the &s;ervices which I am trying to render our ra&s;h friend in Italy may be as great as the pains I have endured in &s;etting out on the adventure!</P>
<P>I have been &s;o engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e &s;ufferings, that I have not yet told you I am now on French ground. I had a quick pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the Channel, and without any &s;ickne&s;s except that of the heart. As I traver&s;ed the deck of our ve&s;&s;el, I continually thought of our dear angelic Giuliana and her &s;imilar &s;uffer|ings in this very pa&s;&s;age. Alas, my dear Lucy, I call our &s;ufferings &s;imilar; but to you I will confe&s;s, and with &s;hame confe&s;s, their difference. In &s;earching my own dreary heart, I find no portion of that divine re&s;ignation and enthu&s;i|a&s;m with which our adored Giuliana &s;upported her &s;orrow, and converted into a ble&s;&s;ing the very bitterne&s;s of affliction. Oh! Philo&s;ophy, I begin to abhor thee as the mo&s;t treacherous of guides. Thou art magnificent in thy promi&s;es, but contemptible in thy performance. In the twilight of ordinary unafflicted life, thou only &s;erve&s;t to drown by thy loud-talking our &s;aluta|ry apprehen&s;ions; but, when the darkne&s;s of real tribulation falls upon us, our loquacious
<PB N="148" REF="150">
leader becomes a mere mute, and all the im|pre&s;&s;ion which thy voice has left upon the heart is regret and &s;hame for having tru&s;ted it &s;o long. Oh! Lucy, if it &s;hall be my lot to &s;ee you and the dear orphan no more, pray remember it is the reque&s;t of my heart, that you will infu&s;e in|to the very promi&s;ing mind of your precious lit|tle ward an early &s;erious &s;en&s;e of Religion. Do not, my dear &s;i&s;ter, let your tenderne&s;s take any alarm at a &s;ugge&s;tion &s;o little expected from me. Do not, I conjure you, &s;uppo&s;e that I have any gloomy pre&s;age of ha&s;tening to the grave. On the contrary, I can a&s;&s;ure you, my health is already mended by my travels; and I begin to be animated by the hope of accompli&s;hing the devout wi&s;h of our dear Charles, and of bring|ing back an unexceptionable hu&s;band to the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of enamoured woman, our matchle&s;s Cornelia. Perhaps, in labouring to pre&s;erve the unballa&s;ted &s;pirit of my precipi|tate friend, I may &s;ave my own al&s;o from a wreck that I did not apprehend. Happy in|deed &s;hall we be, if, after all our various diffi|culties and di&s;tre&s;s of mind, we at la&s;t form all together a little firmly &s;ettled &s;ociety, united not only by human but coele&s;tial ties.

It is not enough that your relations of this hou&s;e have watched over my poor feeble frame, and more &s;hattered &s;pirits, with ince&s;&s;ant unwearied tenderne&s;s and parental anxiety; even your dear &s;edate Edmund is to quit for me, I find,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
that quiet and comfortable home, to which he is &s;o much wedded, and to wander for my &s;ake over &s;eas and mountains to Genoa. I might indeed play the ungrateful prude, and pretend that I have no concern in his travels; but the &s;pirit of your Cornelia, my dear Lucy, was ne|ver formed for any unworthy &s;ubterfuge, any vain or ungenerous di&s;gui&s;e. No, my dear, I entreat you to tell your friendly Edmund, that my heart will for ever call it&s;elf his debtor. Whoever attempts to &s;erve our dear precipitate mi&s;guided Seymour will a&s;&s;uredly render a &s;er|vice to me that I &s;hall ever be mo&s;t willing to acknowledge. I will freely confe&s;s to you, my &s;weet friend, that I feel the idea of Edmund's journey as the fir&s;t ray of chearful light that has glanced on my benighted &s;pirits &s;ince I &s;unk in|to the wretched &s;tate of debility and dejection, from which my incomparable friends have been labouring to re&s;tore me. It is not my dear Lu|cy, that I fondly catch at a fal&s;e and frivolous hope of making the beloved fugitive my hu&s;|band. No, believe me, that Heaven which gave me &s;trength to reject the mo&s;t in&s;inuating, the mo&s;t dangerous, the mo&s;t idolized of all mortal tempters, &s;till prevents my &s;inking into a weak apo&s;tacy, from which I have &s;o fer|vently prayed to be pre&s;erved. In this point I have &s;ome rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with my&s;elf; and whenever I ca&s;t my eyes on my children, tho&s;e precious &s;ources and rewards of my re&s;o|lution, I feel an inexpre&s;&s;ible maternal triumph in my &s;oul, which I am convinced no tempta|tions in the world could ever induce me to for|feit. Yet, &s;upported as I am by a proper &s;en&s;e of my own conduct, and flattered as I am by
<PB N="151" REF="153">
our dear friends of this hou&s;e on my fortitude (alas! they know not how weak a wretch they flatter); I am di&s;tracted with the dread of a thou&s;and evils into which I may have driven the lo&s;t Seymour. Oh God! how bitter is the con|dition of my own &s;afety, &s;ince I could obtain it only by the hazard of proving a &s;ource of wretch|edne&s;s to the man whom I have &s;o many rea&s;ons to love! Ah! my dear Lucy, you, who know as well as I do his fiery and precipitate &s;pirit, will pity the agonizing terrors which it ince&s;&s;antly awakens in my heart. How often do we hear of impetuous men, who ru&s;h into a de&s;perate and &s;udden marriage from motives of re&s;entment and indignation. Oh, Heavens! my dear Lu|cy, I could not hear that Seymour was married thus and &s;urvive it. Merciful God! pre&s;erve me from a blow that would irritate my poor &s;hat|tered brain into madne&s;s! Yet why &s;hould I feel it thus? Oh, Lucy! are the&s;e &s;entiments that become the firm votary of Rea&s;on and Re|ligion? No, my con&s;cience tells me they are not; yet I feel they are &s;o interwoven with the fibres of my heart, that I know not how to tear them from my brea&s;t. O Jealou&s;y! thou keen|e&s;t of tortures, I did not think it was po&s;&s;ible for thee to exi&s;t when Hope was utterly extingui&s;h|ed; but I feel that thy &s;tings can pierce even the cold armour of De&s;pair, and again&s;t them there is no defence but the dark &s;hield of Death. O, Lucy! I have thrown my poor trembling nerves into &s;uch di&s;order by the phantoms which my own troubled fancy has conjured up, that I mu&s;t throw down my pen, and re&s;ume it at
<PB N="152" REF="154">
&s;ome &s;ea&s;on of more tranquillity; if &s;uch a &s;ea|&s;on never arrives, this paper &s;hall never reach you.</P>
<P>The preceding pages have waited long, my dear Lucy, for this po&s;t&s;cript; but in the inter|val, how deeply has my heart been affected with &s;orrow, with pity, and with gratitude, in hearing all that I have heard of your amiable af|flicted brother!&mdash;Poor Edmund! has he too experienced the turbulent angui&s;h of an unwi&s;e and fatal affection? and, overwhelmed as he mu&s;t be with recent grief, has he &s;till the gene|ro&s;ity to &s;urmount his own immediate di&s;tre&s;s, and proceed directly to a&s;&s;ume the guidance and protection of our ra&s;h rambling Seymour?
<Q><L>Reward Him for the noble deed, ju&s;t Heaven!</L>
<L>For this one action, guard Him, and di&s;tingui&s;h Him</L>
<L>With &s;ignal mercies, and with great deliverance!</L>
<L>Let him know nothing el&s;e but good on earth.</L>
<L>And everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s hereafter.</L></Q>
Heaven indeed has almo&s;t granted half this pray|er, in giving him, my dear Lucy, &s;uch a com|forter as you are, and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed guardian for his poor little de&s;erted Fanny. But ha&s;te, I conjure you, and bring this dear intere&s;ting or|phan to us. I long to take the little haple&s;s in|nocent to my bo&s;om, and cheri&s;h her as my own daughter. I perceive already that &s;he will prove to me a &s;weet and &s;oothing companion; for my full heart will &s;eem at lea&s;t to relieve it&s;elf, while I am care&s;&s;ing the child, from that burthen of
<PB N="153" REF="155">
unutterable gratitude which I feel towards her father. Ha&s;te, therefore, my dear friend, I a|gain conjure you, to a hou&s;e where every heart is eager to bid you welcome, and none more &s;o than the poor brui&s;ed and troubled, but &s;till warm and feeling, heart of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV FROM MISS AUDLEY TO HER BROTHER EDMUND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY VERY DEAR AND GENEROUS TRAVELLER.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with no little portion of pride and delight that I thank you for all the kind things you &s;ay of me in your affecting letter. It return, I &s;hall give you &s;o &s;peedy an account of the dear little Fairy Queen (whom I have the plea&s;ure to
<PB N="154" REF="156">
attend more as a wor&s;hiper than a governe&s;s), that I am per&s;uaded my letter will reach Genoa long before you can. I figure to my&s;elf the great joy you will have in peru&s;ing, under the roof of the dear &s;ympathetic Giuliana, the plea&s;|ing hi&s;tory I have to give of my delightful little companion. I love your parental anxiety, in a&s;king me to de&s;cribe the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion &s;he made on the friendly circle here. But, my dear Ed|mund, when you made this reque&s;t, you &s;hould have in&s;pired me with powers of de&s;cription far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the humble ones I po&s;&s;e&s;s; for the &s;cene you wi&s;h to have repre&s;ented to you re|quires a very ma&s;terly hand.</P>
<P>O that I were a Shak&s;peare in petticoats for your &s;ake! I would then pre&s;ent you with &s;uch a fairy drama as would draw &s;ome tears of tenderne&s;s and delight from your parental eyes. But as it is, I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with a&s;king you a &s;imple que&s;tion: Did you ever ob&s;erve the female faces in the gallery of a playhou&s;e when extraordinary talents were di&s;played by &s;ome Liliputian prince or prince&s;s? If you have, you have &s;een tho&s;e &s;peaking faces expre&s;s a tender admiration, and &s;omething like a doubt whether the infantine performer could be an infant or not. And, having &s;een &s;uch faces, you may have, in recollecting them, a very good idea of the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion made by our dear little Fan|ny in this friendly theatre, where all her infan|tine graces are admired, and all her early talents called forth. You know we are fond of chil|dren; and believe me, no child can have a more bewitching manner of conciliating affecti|on. Harriot thinks her extremely like you; and every time &s;he &s;ays &s;o, Cornelia is ready to
<PB N="155" REF="157">
pre&s;s this living miniture of you to her bo&s;om, in a tran&s;port of gratitude for tho&s;e &s;ervices which we tru&s;t you are now rendering to our whole party by the important object of your ex|cur&s;ion. How happy will your letters make us all, if you are able to &s;end us accounts as good as I have now the plea&s;ure of di&s;patching to you! I have not only the great &s;atisfaction of a&s;&s;uring you, that your child is idolized and made happy here; but I am able to add, that &s;he is an ab&s;olute cordial, and a very &s;alutary and delightful one, to the tender &s;pirits of Cor|nelia; they have taken a prodigious fancy to each other; &s;o much &s;o, that I &s;hould be quite jealous if I did not con&s;ider Cornelia as a kind of &s;econd &s;elf.</P>
<P>Apropos of Jealou&s;y: we have had a mo&s;t ludicrous little example of that tragical pa&s;&s;ion, and a proof how very early it begins to agitate and di&s;tre&s;s the poor female heart. My &s;weet little niece and name&s;ake, whom Cornelia wi&s;h|es to &s;ee in future days united to her elde&s;t &s;on, and who is already &s;tyled his little wife, has be|gun, young as &s;he is, to weep for the incon&s;tan|cy of her William. The Liliputian traitor was &s;o enchanted by the more womanly attractions of our blooming Fanny, that he grievou&s;ly de|&s;erted his more infantine <HI>cara &s;po&s;a.</HI> The points and freaks of jealou&s;y at three years old appear|ed very laughable to Harriot and me; but Cor|nelia, who has, I believe, much more genuine tenderne&s;s than either of us, &s;ays we are ab&s;olute Barbarians, and &s;he could not re&s;t her&s;elf till &s;he had made the tiny tormented heart quite ea&s;y. This &s;he very dexterou&s;ly accompli&s;hed; and diverted us not a little, by her mode of ma|naging
<PB N="156" REF="158">
the affections of our Fairy groupe, in which &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the intelligence and good-nature of Fanny, who has, with great &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, accept|ed the younger Sedley as her &s;wain. To all the&s;e matters I alluded, when I told you, that, had I the talents of Shake&s;peare, I could &s;end you a very intere&s;ting Fairy-drama. Believe me, the quarrel and reconcilement of Titania and Oberon are not more highly dramatic than the &s;cenes that have pa&s;&s;ed between our little Lucy and William.</P>
<P>Had I not &s;een &s;o much of your parental ten|derne&s;s, I &s;hould be afraid of your thinking me a &s;ad old go&s;&s;iping nur&s;e, for having talked &s;o long of our little folks. They have indeed en|gro&s;&s;ed &s;o much of my paper, that I can only add a few words of our grown gentry.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, &s;hall be &s;erious words. And fir&s;t let me &s;ay, that our dear Charles dropt a tear of paternal joy over one pa&s;&s;age of your very affecting letter to me: I need not tell you which pa&s;&s;age, nor with what cordial &s;atisfaction he &s;peaks of that happy revolution which he &s;ays is now working in your mind; and which Cornelia &s;ometimes, I believe, con&s;iders as a ble&s;&s;ed harbinger of a &s;imilar revolution in the mind of a certain per&s;on &s;till dearer to her than you are.&mdash;Pray tell our beloved Giuliana, that if &s;he wi&s;hes to make a little paradi&s;e on earth for her Engli&s;h friends, &s;he has only to lead in per&s;on the two converted wanderers to this door, that will

<HEAD>LETTER XXV. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>AT length, my dear and too long di&s;regarded prophet, the mi&s;chiefs you have frequently foreboded are fallen on me. I am paying, at this moment, a heavy penalty for having laugh|ed &s;o often at your prudent timidity in the pur|&s;uit
<PB N="158" REF="160">
of plea&s;ure. While you, without a rival in your rural love, and un&s;u&s;pected by the graver part of the world, are quietly enjoying the ten|derne&s;s, and even the whim&s;ies, of your con|&s;tant though capricious Sylvia; I am thrown, by my impetuous folly, on a couch of pain, pe|nitence, and di&s;honour. A &s;ad example, I con|fe&s;s, my dear cautious Edmund, of the maxim from our favourite poet, which you have &s;o vain|ly endeavoured to fix as an amulet on my ha&s;ty &s;pirit.</P>
<Q>That violent delights have violent ends.</Q>
<P>But you will rejoice that I am &s;till living, when I tell you it has appeared a matter of great doubt whether my half departed life would re|turn to me or not. You would not ea&s;ily gue&s;s the per&s;on to whom I am indebted for its imme|diate pre&s;ervation. I mu&s;t ha&s;ten therefore to tell you, that I owe it entirely to the humanity, the noblene&s;s of nature, and, I may add, the medical &s;kill, of the very Don Manuel who&s;e private rights I had &s;o gro&s;sly invaded. Ah, Edmund, if I &s;hould live, I have learnt at lea&s;t one le&s;&s;on, and that is, never to believe what rumour &s;ays to the prejudice of per&s;ons who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by extraordinary talents. Men of genius are too much inclined, perhaps to de&s;|&s;pi&s;e the world; but the world takes ample re|venge, by giving them quick credit for a thou|&s;and unexi&s;ting enormities.</P>
<P>I had fooli&s;hly believed that my noble Seig|nor of Portugal was an old voluptuous brute and tyrannical Barbarian. I have found him ex|actly the rever&s;e. He is indeed, as report &s;aid
<PB N="159" REF="161">
of him, a prodigy of univer&s;al knowledge; but he is equally admirable for candour, indul|gence, and genero&s;ity. Violante is in truth no mi&s;tre&s;s of his, but a wild and licentious, though lovely, daughter of Eve, whom the kind Seignor, with more zeal than prudence, undertook to di&s;cipline and reform for a young noble friend, who loves her to &s;uch a pitch of di&s;traction that he has &s;erious thoughts of mak|ing her his wife. Nor would any one find rea|&s;on to cen&s;ure his idea, if &s;uperlative beauty and talents could atone for the want of cha&s;tity in a married woman. Though the charms and allurements of this Syren have nearly put a &s;orry end to my life, I cannot even now &s;peak of them without prai&s;e. But you will grow impa|tient for my own particular hi&s;tory. Let me pau&s;e a little, my dear Edmund, and you &s;hall have it. I am &s;o feeble, and &s;o con&s;trained in my po&s;ture, that I can only write a few lines at a time. But, after a little re&s;t, I will begin my di&s;a&s;trous adventures, and proceed as far as pain and langor will give me leave.</P>
<P>During my &s;econd vi&s;it to Violante we were alarmed in the middle of the night, or rather towards morning. The fair agile Venetian &s;prang ha&s;tily from her pillow; and, having li&s;tened a few moments on the out&s;ide of her chamber-door, &s;he flew rapidly within, and turned the key. "The old Seignor is certain|ly returned," cried the terrified Violante&mdash; "the &s;ecretary has watched and betrayed us&mdash; if the old tyrant catches you here, my love, he
<PB N="160" REF="162">
will take perhaps both our lives&mdash;I am certainly ruined for ever if you cannot contrive to e&s;cape from this window&mdash;I think you may&mdash;for Hea|ven's &s;ake, try if it is po&s;&s;ible!" Such were the &s;ugge&s;tions of my poor frighted companion, while &s;he ran backwards and forwards to a win|dow in a little adjoining dre&s;&s;ing-room, clo&s;e to which grew a tall poplar, &s;o very near the win|dow that I could ea&s;ily touch the leaves with my hand; but there was not any &s;trong branch within the utmo&s;t reach of my extended arm.</P>
<P>There was however a &s;hort and &s;light pole laid acro&s;s from the window to the tree, which &s;erved as a pa&s;&s;age to a favourite tame &s;quirrel of Violante's, which lived alternately in her room and in the tree. My only chance was to &s;pring lightly over this pole, and &s;eize the large limb of the poplar on which it re&s;ted. As I have ever been, you know, a little vain of my agility, I thought I could &s;afely accompli&s;h this hazardous &s;tep; and I was induced to attempt it by the agony of terror which was vi&s;ible in every look and ge&s;ture of Violante, and by her extreme anxiety to pre&s;erve her reputation. After giving her a very ha&s;ty ki&s;s, and receiv|ing from her all the little aid &s;he could afford me, I &s;et my foot on the fatal pole, and, not being a &s;quirrel, made it crack beneath me. I had ju&s;t time enough to throw my&s;elf forward, and catch hold of &s;ome quivering boughs, which &s;erved, they tell me, in &s;ome degree, to break my fall, and &s;aved me from in&s;tant death, though not from utter &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">How irre&s;i&s;tible are the &s;udden emotions of humanity! Anxious as Violante was to &s;ave her own credit by removing her luckle&s;s paramour with the peril of his bones, &s;he could not refrain from a loud &s;hriek in beholding my fall: and that piercing &s;hriek, which rung in my ears as I fell, is the la&s;t thing I can recollect till, after a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;en&s;e and life, which continued, they tell me during &s;everal hours, I awaked to the full perception of pain and infirmity, in a lower apartment of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Judge, my dear Edmund, of my equal a&s;to|ni&s;hment and angui&s;h, when, in fir&s;t opening my eyes, I beheld the &s;triking countenance of Don Manuel, who was employed at that mo|ment in cha&s;ing my temples with all the kind anxiety of a medical friend! I fancy, a wound|ed con&s;cience gives peculiar quickne&s;s to the powers of recollection, for, in the in&s;tant that I perceived the kindne&s;s of my maje&s;tic attend|ant, I felt more angui&s;h of mind than pain of body, though my whole frame was in a very horrible condition. My head, though much brui&s;ed, had e&s;caped, by luckily pitching on &s;oft ground in a marvellous manner, e&s;pecially as my body &s;truck obliquely again&s;t an antique altar of marble, which &s;tood as an ornament to the garden, and, wounding me with its rough broken edge, &s;hattered two of my ribs, and la|cerated my brea&s;t. Whether it was owing to my extreme weakne&s;s, from the blood I had lo&s;t, and the brui&s;es I had &s;u&s;tained, or whether I may impute it to the natural &s;en&s;ibility of my temper, I cannot tell; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, that at the &s;ight of Don Manuel I bur&s;t into tears, and exclaimed, "Oh, Seignor, I
<PB N="162" REF="164">
cannot endure this friendly attention from the man whom I have injured!" He an&s;wered me in Italian, with a mild dignity, "I entreat you, my young friend, to keep your &s;pirits as calm as po&s;&s;ible. I can a&s;&s;ure you that you have not injured me, though you have, from an im|prudence very natural at your age, engaged in a ra&s;h and perilous adventure, which has nearly co&s;t you your life. I tru&s;t, however, that we &s;hall &s;ave you; and if your name is Seymour, as I have &s;ome little rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it is, I &s;hall have a particular delight in your pre&s;erva|tion. You will ea&s;ily conceive, my dear Ed|mund, how my a&s;toni&s;hment redoubled when I found my&s;elf not only known, but endeared by being known, to my generous pre&s;erver. Don Manuel, it &s;eems, is a very old friend of Giu|liana's father, and has frequently been their gue&s;t at Genoa. In a late vi&s;it to them he heard the hi&s;tory of my re&s;toring that angelic wander|er to the parental arms of Pinelli; and, as Ma|nuel is him&s;elf a &s;ingular enthu&s;ia&s;t, he con|ceived a great prejudice in my favour, and a vehement de&s;ire, as he tells me, that chance might introduce me to his per&s;onal acquaint|ance. It has now indeed accompli&s;hed his de|&s;ire, and in a manner which &s;hews me very for|cibly how Providence &s;eems to plea&s;e it&s;elf in rewarding an action of di&s;intere&s;ted benevo|lence. I little thought that the &s;light &s;ervices which I rendered to Giuliana would ever pro|cure me &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in an hour of cala|mity.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165">As &s;oon as I found that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome un|expected influence on the generous &s;pirit of the old Seignor, I began to exert it in behalf of the too attractive Violante. Upon my making &s;ome anxious enquiries and interceding for this love|ly delinquent, her noble guardian imparted to me the private anecdote which I have mention|ed in the opening of this long epi&s;tle, or rather &s;eries of epi&s;tles. He acquainted me al&s;o with his re&s;olution of &s;ending her home to her native city with a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for her life, and his hope of per&s;uading his young enamoured friend to relinqui&s;h the prepo&s;terous idea of mar|rying a beauty whom the mo&s;t &s;plendid pro&s;pect of ambition could not reclaim from the mo&s;t pro|voking incontinence. Poor Violante indeed is as frail and fal&s;e as &s;he is fair. The vehement quarrel between her and the old Seignor, which proved &s;uch a &s;nare to me, aro&s;e from a very warm expo&s;tulation which her noble guardian thought it his duty to utter again&s;t a tendency which the lady had di&s;covered to connect her|&s;elf with a young Frenchman of fa&s;hion, whom the cautious Don Manuel had ingeniou&s;ly con|trived to remove in good time from the reach of her attraction. Her quick pa&s;&s;ions, irritated by this di&s;appointment, had ha&s;tily made me the haple&s;s in&s;trument of her revenge. But here I mu&s;t again drop my pen, not only for ea&s;e of po&s;ture, but to conver&s;e a little with my admi|rable kind friend and phy&s;ician Don Manuel.</P>
<P>This noble Portugueze is a very engaging character: but alas! my dear Edmund, how
<PB N="164" REF="166">
different is the angui&s;h of the wounds under which I am now &s;marting from that which con|fined me at Sedley-hall! My &s;ufferings here are my &s;hame; but there I had a delightful pride in every pang. Here is no tender Cornelia, to &s;oothe and con&s;ole me, to convert pain into tran&s;port, by that angelic &s;en&s;ibility and grati|tude with which &s;he &s;hewed me how deeply &s;he felt that honourable wound which I received in her &s;ervice. Ah! my &s;weet Cornelia, perhaps I &s;hall never &s;ee thy lovely compa&s;&s;ionate coun|tenance again. Yet, in my mind's eye I be|hold thee at this moment; yes, I behold thee, angelic as thou art, in all thy radient perfection. The mi&s;t of pride and indignation that did thee &s;uch cruel inju&s;tice is bani&s;hed from my mind. Oh, Edmund! what an ideot! But I mu&s;t not indulge this fond emotion of returning tender|ne&s;s, nor lay thus weeping, like a &s;ick girl, over my own infirmities. I will take a little chearing &s;u&s;tenance, and then endeavour to chat with you my dear Edmund, a little longer, and, if I can, in a more manly &s;tyle.</P>
<P>I am much revived by a little wine and water, and &s;till more by the ble&s;&s;ed intelligence that I &s;hall to-morrow &s;ee the long-wi&s;hed-for Giuliana. I have the additional comfort of being plea&s;ed with my&s;elf a little for having ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ome firmne&s;s and &s;pirit through a &s;cene that I thought would affect me in my pre&s;ent weak condition much more than it did. Poor Violante, who is ju&s;t &s;etting forth on her return to Venice, re|que&s;ted
<PB N="165" REF="167">
to be indulged in a conference with me, for the &s;ake of being a&s;&s;ured that I perfectly for|give her for all the &s;evere &s;ufferings which her amorous indi&s;cretion has drawn upon me.&mdash; Our interview was very friendly, though not ve|ry tender on either &s;ide. The half-penitent and half-affrighted girl looked upon me rather with a look of terror than of tenderne&s;s, as a man who&s;e death might throw a grievous burthen on her &s;oul. I, on my part, &s;urveyed her with a fixt and &s;erious concern, in reflecting on the &s;ad contra&s;t between the probable mi&s;ery of her life, and the rare accompli&s;hments that &s;he has received both from nature and from art.&mdash; Though every &s;park of de&s;ire was extingui&s;hed, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, in my &s;hattered frame, I could not behold her without a kind of fond pity and fre&s;h admiration of her exqui&s;ite beau|ty. The&s;e emotions, however, &s;eemed to be confined to my eyes, for my heart was harden|ed again&s;t her in&s;inuating voice by the remem|brance of her unnece&s;&s;ary lyes. The&s;e were manifold: and as you know how much I de&s;pi&s;e a lyar in either &s;ex, you will not wonder that they had entirely annihilated my e&s;teem for this alluring fair. While &s;he &s;lowly approached me, I could not help murmuring to my&s;elf, in the words of Shak&s;peare,
<Q><L>That we can call the&s;e delicate creatures ours,</L>
<L>And not their appetites!</L></Q>
When &s;he drew nearer, I di&s;cerned in her coun|tenance &s;uch &s;igns of timidity and compuncti|on as made me eager to relieve her from the dread which I &s;aw &s;he entertained of my death.
<PB N="166" REF="168">
She threw her&s;elf on her knees by the &s;ide of a little tent-bed in which they had placed me. and in great agitation implored my forgivene&s;s. You will ea&s;ily conceive that I &s;aid every thing which I thought mo&s;t likely to tranquillize her &s;pirits; but you will not perhaps imagine that, in giving her my full pardon for all the deceit which &s;he frankly confe&s;&s;ed, I gave her al&s;o much &s;ober advice.</P>
<P>Grieved as you will be for me, my dear Ed|mund, I think you will hardly forbear &s;miling at this picture of your impetuous friend, employed in preaching a &s;ermon upon truth and conti|nence to a Venetian Courtezan.</P>
<P>I preached, I believe (though &s;peaking is ve|ry painful to me, as my lungs have been injur|ed), with &s;ome energy of language, but I doubt with little effect: I mean, permanent effect on the future life of my fair auditor; for during my oration, which was often interrupted by my pain and difficulty of utterance, the poor trem|bling Violante profe&s;&s;ed to regard me as a Hea|ven in&s;pired oracle of purity and peace. In|deed, Soloman him&s;elf was never in a condition to de&s;cant more feelingly on the vanity of vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s. I &s;poke, however, not &s;o much from the impre&s;&s;ion of pre&s;ent pain as from my long-&s;ettled &s;entiments; for a&s;&s;uredly no man was ever formed with a heart and mind le&s;s di&s;|po&s;ed to play the libertine, no man has a more perfect e&s;teem for the cha&s;te plea&s;ures of genu|ine love, than I have ever felt, though it has not been my lot to obtain them; and now perhaps&mdash;But I will not touch a plaintive &s;tring. Violante is gone; and Heaven grant that I may prove, as &s;he told me I &s;hould, the means

<P>You would be highly plea&s;ed, my dear Ed|mund, with my noble friend of Portugal. He is wonderfully active for his age, which is full 65, both in body and mind. His eyes &s;till re|tain all the fire of youth, though he is com|pleatly emancipated from the imperious folly of that &s;ea&s;on, and thanks Heaven, he &s;ays, like old Sophocles, that he has at length got rid of the wild bea&s;t. He con&s;iders Love as the tran|&s;ient madne&s;s of early life; and thinks it the duty of every man, to whom age has given the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;en&s;es, to &s;uccour all who are labouring under this dangerous delirium. In &s;hort, he is one of the mo&s;t lively, plea&s;ant, and charitable elders, that I ever met with. My particular obligations to him are too great for any words to expre&s;s. But alas!

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY VERY DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was a good angel indeed (as Lucy &s;aid) that prompted you to engage me in this di&s;tant expedition. Had I not vi&s;ited Italy, little, alas!
<PB N="176" REF="178">
would my chance have been of ever beholding the intere&s;ting countenance of our dear incon|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">derate Seymour again. Even now, when I am arrived at Genoa, I know not whether I may yet &s;ee him alive. It is with the deepe&s;t angui&s;h of heart I inform you, that I find him not in this city, and here he is &s;lowly travelling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ither, very grievou&s;ly wounded by &s;ome hor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d ca&s;ualty, the particulars of which I am un|able to learn; it is yet a great comfort to me to know that he is under the immediate care of our dear Giuliana and her excellent father.</P>
<P>I have been interrupted, ju&s;t as I was begin|ning to pour out to you all the dark anxiety of a dejected &s;pirit, by a mo&s;t welcome, unexpect|ed, and for &s;ome time unknown vi&s;itor. As we unluckily po&s;&s;e&s;s but little of each other's lan|guage, our conver&s;ation has pa&s;&s;ed more in ge&s;ture than in words. Our hearts, however, being both full of the &s;ame ardent wi&s;hes, under|&s;tood each other completely; and mine has caught new life and hope from the hone&s;t affec|tionate creature, who laboured to the utmo&s;t of his power to in&s;pire me with both.</P>
<P>This agreeable enlivening vi&s;itor is Pietro, the good old &s;ervant of Signor Pinelli, who&s;e name and character you will recollect in Seymour's intere&s;ting account of Giuliana's return to the hou&s;e of her father. The active Pietro had ha&s;|tened to Genoa, to prepare all things at home for the reception of his family and their dear wounded fellow-traveller. The hone&s;t fellow, who did not quit them till they had pa&s;&s;ed through con&s;iderably more than half their journey, a&s;|&s;ures me that Seymour &s;upports it <HI>to admiration,</HI> to u&s;e his own forcible expre&s;&s;ion. He &s;eems,
<PB N="177" REF="179">
indeed, to think &s;o highly of our friend's noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that I believe he hardly reckons him a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. At lea&s;t, he will not allow me to har|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ur the grievous apprehen&s;ion under which I began my letter, that our friend may not reach Genoa alive. Pietro prote&s;ts that I &s;hall &s;ee him much recovered to-morrow.

<P>I have acquie&s;ced, however, in another pro|po&s;al of the good Pietro's, becau&s;e it &s;eemed as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I &s;hould break the hone&s;t fellow's heart if I re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed his reque&s;t.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AT length, my dear brother, they are ar|rived; and never did any meeting of anxious and grateful friends more abundantly call forth the tears of tenderne&s;s and delight, mingled, alas! on my part with the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ations of pity and of terror.&mdash;I will not attempt, my dear Charles, to chear you with any hopes that I feel not my&s;elf; and I am therefore under the pain|ful nece&s;&s;ity of telling you, that the grievou&s;ly altered appearance of our friend alarms me in the greate&s;t degree! Heavens! what a deplora|ble
<PB N="180" REF="182">
change in his gay and gallant figure has this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orrible calamity produced! His florid cheeks are grown as pale and hollow as the very image of death, his whole frame emaciated and feeble. &mdash; Yet his native chearfulne&s;s and good temper appear unimpaired; and there is a look of intel|lectual vigour in his countenance, &s;uperior, I think, to what I ever ob&s;erved in his mo&s;t heal|thy days, though intelligence was at all times the characteri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c of his features. We can ea&s;ily account indeed for his being &s;o extremely re|duced, as he has taken no &s;u&s;tenance but liquids, and tho&s;e only in &s;mall quantity, &s;ince the hor|rible mi&s;chance. Whenever he has ventured on the &s;malle&s;t portion of &s;olid food, even of the &s;imple&s;t kind, his cough and pain became almo&s;t in&s;upportable. But I will not &s;peak farther on this point at pre&s;ent, as I am re&s;olved to draw up his ca&s;e in the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial manner that I po&s;&s;ibly can, and enclo&s;e it in this letter, entreating you to &s;end us Bren&s;il's opinion upon it immediately, and de&s;iring him to let that o|pinion be followed by others, which I reque&s;t him to procure from tho&s;e per&s;ons in London whom he would him&s;elf wi&s;h to con&s;ult. They tell me here, that I am too much alarmed; that I do not make &s;uff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cient allowance for the depre&s;|&s;ive and fearful effect which a &s;udden &s;ight of the great alteration in his figure has produced on my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vious &s;pirits.

But as the injury &s;u&s;tained was exten&s;ive and complicated, the cure mu&s;t be a work of con&s;iderable time. Heaven grant that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful conjectures, in which the

warm-hearted Giuliana and her father have much greater confidence than I have, may prove ju&s;tly founded! At all events we &s;hall try every po&s;&s;ible expedient to re&s;tore him; and at pre&s;ent even I, with all my fears, mu&s;t allow there is no immediate &s;ign of impending death.</P>
<P>I have quitted my paper to take a fre&s;h view of this dear, intere&s;ting patient, and have this in&s;tant left him under the care of his good an|gel, as he calls Giuliana, who is reading to him &s;ome chapters of St. John, from her Italian Bible. I have prevented his an&s;wering your very kind letter to-day, which he wanted to do. It affected him &s;o much, that he dropt tears of gratitude on every page of it; and, having pe|ru&s;ed the whole with great but &s;ilent emotion, he gave it to Giuliana, with the following ex|pre&s;&s;ive words, and a look &s;till more expre&s;&s;ive: "Here, my good angel! here is a letter that you will read with delight, becau&s;e it was dic|tated by a &s;pirit as angelic as your own." Giuliana did not think le&s;s favourably of the writer; and you will give me credit, my dear Charles, for the joy I felt in hearing prai&s;e mo&s;t cordially be&s;towed on a brother whom I have every rea&s;on to love. But my be&s;t way of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nking you for all your kindne&s;s to my friend will be, to pur&s;ue the purpo&s;e for which I re|&s;umed my pen, and to give you as good an ac|count as I can of our meeting here, and of &s;uch conver&s;ation as we have hitherto held together.</P>
<P>My eagerne&s;s to &s;alute the travellers with a welcome they little expected, made me loiter ye&s;terday for &s;ome hours by the water-&s;ide, till Pietro, finding me faint and almo&s;t &s;ick with
<PB N="182" REF="184">
expectation and anxiety, per&s;uaded me to re|tire for refre&s;hment, and wait to receive them at home, promi&s;ing to tell them nothing more than that an Engli&s;h gentleman was arrived with letters, as I wi&s;hed to have the plea&s;ure of &s;urprizing them. I had refre&s;hed my&s;elf, and endeavoured to beguile the anxious minutes in the Seignor's very noble library, where taking up a volume of Meta&s;ta&s;io, I had ju&s;t thrown my nerves into a very tender vibration by his &s;weet de&s;cription of Friend&s;hip in the opera of Olimpiade, when the dear friend, for whom I waited &s;o anxiou&s;ly arrived.</P>
<P>Having heard that a gentleman from Eng|land was waiting in the library, Giuliana dart|ed fir&s;t into the room, with that celerity of mo|tion which quick affections in&s;pire. "O Hea|ven! exclaimed the lovely enthu&s;ia&s;t, it is my dear father, Edmund!" So &s;aying, &s;he threw her&s;elf into my arms in a tran&s;port of gratitude; "This is kind indeed, &s;he continued; it is al|mo&s;t a miracle: &s;urely you cannot have re|ceived my letter?" "No, my angelic daugh|ter." "And have not you heard of our poor Seymour's &s;ad accident?" "Yes I have." "Then &s;urely, my dear Edmund, you are a magician, and have &s;ome &s;ecret art of knowing what happens to your ab&s;ent friends, and &s;ome &s;upernatural method of conveying your&s;elf to comfort them in di&s;tre&s;s. Ble&s;s the good Spirits who have brought you to the hou&s;e of your far di&s;tant child, ju&s;t in the moment when &s;he mo&s;t wanted you to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in re|&s;toring your favourite friend!" Here &s;he em|braced me with fre&s;h emotions of truly filial de|light. But recollecting how I mu&s;t be &s;hocked at the dreadful alteration in the countenance of her
<PB N="183" REF="185">
dear patient, &s;he was beginning to prepare me for a &s;ight of him, when his emaciated figure appeared &s;lowly creeping through the half-open door. Giuliana had &s;uppo&s;ed him to be re&s;ting him&s;elf in another apartment; but his quick ears had caught the &s;ound of <HI>Edmund</HI> on her fir&s;t lively exclamation, and he had followed her as fa&s;t as his infirm and painful condition would allow him to do. The fir&s;t &s;ight of me affected him &s;o much, that I believe he would have fainted, if I had not &s;prung forward, and &s;upported his languid frame in my arms. He fell on my neck, and bur&s;t into tears; but &s;oon recovered him&s;elf enough to expre&s;s the mo&s;t lively joy on my arrival. He declared, with his u&s;ual kindne&s;s and warmth, that my &s;ociety would do him more good than all the &s;urgeons in Europe; and that now he had a perfect a&s;|&s;urance of a &s;peedy cure, provided, &s;aid the af|fectionate invalid with a look of anxious en|quiry, that you can truly tell me you have left all the dear circle well at Audley-grove. "All well, I replied, or very nearly &s;o, I can a&s;&s;ure you, and the circle as numerous as it was, for I have &s;ent Lucy to fill the vacancy made by the return of the young Loui&s;a to Ireland." "What happy chance then, my dear Edmund, conducted you hither; for you mu&s;t have quit|ted England, I think, before the news of my calamity could have reached it? "O, he is certainly a magician, as I have told him, &s;aid the &s;miling Giuliana. He has conveyed him|&s;elf to us in a very marvellous manner to-day, and to-morrow, I &s;uppo&s;e, by a flouri&s;h of his wand, he will tran&s;port even the divine Cor|nelia into this apartment; and then, my dear
<PB N="184" REF="186">
patient, he will have doubly ratified your cure." "Not &s;o, indeed, my good angel, cried Sey|mour with a gha&s;tly &s;mile. If your magician were to exhibit &s;uch a proof of his art at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;ea|&s;on, in&s;tead or re&s;toring he would utterly de|moli&s;h me. There is nothing that I could &s;o ill &s;u&s;tain as unmerited kindne&s;s from the in|jured object of my idolatry, before I have had time to make any kind of expiation." Oh! exclaimed the quick Giuliana, I love you for your ideas of expiation; but, if the dear magi|cian can &s;et the idol before us, I will an&s;wer for it that all pa&s;t injuries &s;hall be &s;oon expiated and &s;oon forgiven. This, I tru&s;t, we &s;hall &s;ee in due time: at pre&s;ent it would be wrong per|haps to make &s;uch rapid and encroaching de|mands on &s;o kind a magician. He has already done much for me; and the ble&s;&s;ed hour is now come, in which I may in my turn afford him perhaps the very plea&s;ure which his heart is mo&s;t eager to receive." "Oh! my dear Ed|mund, continued the lovely enthu&s;ia&s;t with an air of more &s;erious delight, I cannot re&s;t ano|ther moment without informing you that the cruel impediment is removed. We have only to re&s;tore the health of this dear invalid, to confer upon your divine Cornelia all the happi|ne&s;s &s;he de&s;erves." "You delight me indeed, &s;aid I, pre&s;&s;ing her hand in a tran&s;port of reli|gious joy; and I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible what thanks are due to our good angel for &s;o ble&s;&s;ed an event." "Oh! my good Engli&s;h father, repl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d my lovely and mo&s;t grateful ho&s;te&s;s, how often have I hoped that Heaven would indulge me with &s;ome opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing my gra|titude to you in per&s;on! Did Seymour tell you,
<PB N="185" REF="187">
after he had conducted your poor broken-heart|ed Giuliana to her di&s;tant home; did he tell you how often and how vainly I argued with man in our travels? did he mention one evening in particular (it was at Avignon) when my anxiety for his &s;alvation had &s;haken my very &s;oul? I threw my&s;elf on my knees, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing the &s;pirit of my dear &s;ainted Peverell, I prayed mo&s;t fervently that in &s;ome period of my life I might have the ble&s;&s;ing to behold my generous, mi&s;guided friend and protector, awakened to a ju&s;t and timely knowledge of that God whom my dear departed love had taught me to wor&s;hip with rational adoration! That prayer, my dear Edmund, that fervent prayer was heard. You may now tell the mo&s;t &s;everely-tried and the mo&s;t meritorious of wo|men, that all the cruel conflict in her bo&s;om may cea&s;e for ever. You may tell the incom|parable Cornelia, that &s;he may now indulge without a &s;cruple all the exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s of her heart, for the God whom &s;he has &s;erved &s;o f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">thfully, gives a &s;anction to her love."</P>
<P>"But where is my other father?" cried the lovely enthu&s;ia&s;t, recollecting that I had not yet been the old Seignor. "Oh, Edmund! it has pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded Heaven to ble&s;s me al&s;o by an equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ange in his &s;pirit: though it has not been my de&s;tiny, as I wi&s;hed, to pa&s;s my life with my dear Peverell, yet my pure love for that mo&s;t perfect of mortals has proved a &s;ource, I tru&s;t, of eter|nal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, not only to my own &s;oul, but to others as dear to me as my own." Here &s;he darted a &s;mile of devout chearfulne&s;s on Sey|mour, and after charging him not to hurt him|&s;elf by conver&s;ing too eagerly with me, &s;he left
<PB N="186" REF="188">
us to our&s;elves, and went in que&s;t of her fa|ther.</P>
<P>"What a perfect angel &s;he is! cried Sey|mour to me as our dear ho&s;te&s;s withdrew. Oh, Edmund! I am convinced that your calm and boa&s;ted Philo&s;ophy is but a plau&s;ible cheat; and that Sentiment and Honour, the more eagerly-followed guides of my early life, are no better than luminous vapours to a benighted mind that lead it we know not whither. Your brother, my dear friend, is a&s;&s;uredly in the right. It is Religion alone, as he &s;ays, that can give &s;olid value and real permanent lu&s;tre to human life. It is Religion alone that can remove danger from pro&s;perity, and angui&s;h from affliction. Let me conjure you, my dear friend, to con|template the beneficent efficacy of this principle in this angelic conduct and heavenly &s;tate of mind that you will find more and more rea&s;on to admire in Giuliana; and if an oppo&s;ite ex|ample may be al&s;o in&s;tructive, I need not point it out to my dear Edmund's attention. But on this &s;ubject we &s;hall both, I tru&s;t, have lei&s;ure for much private di&s;cour&s;e, when talking will be more ea&s;y to me. Let me now enquire into a point that fills me with a mo&s;t uncomfortable alarm; the letters that I have lately written to you. I would not for the univer&s;e have them fall into the hands of the dear injured Cornelia. Yet, if Lucy opens them, &s;he, in the &s;imple, affectionate frankne&s;s of her heart&mdash;I interrupt|ed him, to quiet this fear; and a&s;&s;ured him his letters would be perfectly &s;afe in your hands, as you have the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude to keep the gentle &s;pirit of Cornelia as free from all painful agitation as it can be kept after all that has pa&s;&s;|ed.
<PB N="187" REF="189">
He was perfectly &s;atisfied with this a&s;&s;ur|ance, and &s;poke of you with the mo&s;t cordial e&s;teem, gratitude, and confidence. He then que&s;tioned me very clo&s;ely on the immediate cau&s;e of my expedition. I told him all that I have recently &s;uffered; dwelling, my dear Charles, with particular &s;ati&s;faction on the great comfort you afforded me in my di&s;tre&s;s, and your invaluable kindne&s;s to my dear little Fan|ny. We were both affected too vehemently in the cour&s;e of my &s;ad &s;tory, and I was afraid that the extreme &s;ympathy of my tender-hearted friend might be very injurious to him in his pre|&s;ent weak &s;tate. But he a&s;&s;ured me to the con|trary; and I ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure that my mournful narrative con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed that religious turn of mind which I have mentioned in our friend, and which, as I know, my dear Charles, it is the great object of your benevo|lent wi&s;hes, I am de&s;irous of di&s;playing to you exactly as it &s;hewed it&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I had fini&s;hed my melancholy tale, we were agreeably relieved from the &s;ad impre&s;&s;ion it made upon us, by the entrance of the ma|je&s;tic Pinelli and his incomparable daughter. I never beheld a &s;cene of joy &s;o touching as the joy of Giuliana, in introducing her two fa|thers, as &s;he calls us, to each other. Indeed my vanity, or I may rather &s;ay the hone&s;t pride of my heart, was never more gratified than by the many kind and grateful things that were laid to me on this occa&s;ion. As to Giuliana, her delight &s;eemed to have in it &s;omething &s;u|pernatural; placing her&s;elf between us, as I and the Seignor &s;tood together, &s;he cla&s;ped us in her lovely arms with a graceful energy of
<PB N="188" REF="190">
ge&s;ture peculiar to her&s;elf, and her fine face be|came indeed as radiant as the face of an angel. There was a circum&s;tance that I have not yet mentioned, which completed the plenitude ot|her joy. Her noble father having conducted his infirm gue&s;t and his daughter to his own door, &s;tept without imparting his de&s;ign to them to the neighbouring hou&s;e of a very old medical friend, who lives retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, and is only con&s;ulted as an oracle upon great emergen|cies. The an&s;wer of this oracle to the point on which he was con&s;ulted in&s;pired the benevolent Pinelli with the mo&s;t lively hopes of our dear friend&punc;s during well; and the forcible manner in which the zealous Giuliana imparted to us this intelligence added not a little to the general fe|licity of the moment.</P>
<P>You will allow me, my dear Charles, to clo&s;e my long, though ha&s;ty letter, with this animat|ing pre&s;&s;age; Heaven grant it may be true! At all events you may depend on receiving fre&s;h intelligence very &s;oon. In the mean time I &s;ub|mit it entirely to your &s;uperior judgment and tenderne&s;s to communicate as much or as little as you think proper of this information to our very tender and intere&s;ting Cornelia.

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. FROM MR. AUDLEY TO HIS BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>IT was very kind and con&s;iderate in you, my dear Edmund, to &s;end me &s;o &s;peedy a letter from Genoa, without waiting for the arrival of your expected friends. I had indeed, according to your conjecture, been alarmed in no moderate degree, by an account of Seymour's misfortune, which he had addre&s;&s;ed to you. The privilege of peru&s;ing the letters which have arrived in your ab&s;ence has co&s;t me dear: they have filled me with inquietude the more painful, becau&s;e it was &s;uch as I felt my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of confining to my own bo&s;om. I could not ven|ture to impart this alarming accident either to Lucy or Harriot, as neither would have had the power of keeping &s;uch a &s;ecret from the piercing eyes of our anxious Cornelia, who&s;e affections have &s;o quickened her &s;en&s;es, that I could hard|ly tru&s;t my&s;elf, with &s;o agitating a &s;ecret in my bo&s;om, within the reach of their &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>I am grown, however, le&s;s fearful, &s;ince I have been comforted by the lively hopes of the hone&s;t Pietro, and &s;till more by the la&s;t letter ad|dre&s;&s;ed to you from Seymour. There is a pa&s;|&s;age in this letter which in&s;pires me with the mo&s;t delightful of all expectations; I mean, a
<PB N="190" REF="192">
happy change in the religious &s;entiments of our friend, which, if his life is out of danger, as I tru&s;t it is, will en&s;ure to him that felicity in marriage which we are all &s;o eager to &s;ee him at|tain. As to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our dear Corne|lia's affections, I &s;hall enable you to form a perfect idea of them, by imparting to you a few particulars of our private conver&s;ation. She is eager to &s;eize all opportunities of chatting with me alone, on the flattering pretence that &s;he draws from my conver&s;ation the power of cor|recting the infirmities of her own tender mind, but in truth (though I believe &s;he is not aware of this motive) to indulge her&s;elf in conver&s;ing on her favourite topic, and to draw from me all the intelligence &s;he can. As we were ye&s;terday alone together, and engaged on our perpetual theme, I &s;aid to her, "Now, my gentle friend, as there is a lovely frank &s;implicity in your na|ture, infinitely &s;uperior to the artificial re&s;erve of your &s;ex, tell me candidly which would give you mo&s;t pain, to hear that Seymour was dead or married." She &s;tarted at my idea; and after the pau&s;e of a moment replied, "This is a cru|el que&s;tion indeed; but I will be as frank as you de&s;ire, and tell you that my mind immediately proclaims one an&s;wer, and my heart mutters another. Married! No! Di&s;tract me not with &s;uch an idea. Yet what right, what rea&s;on have I&mdash;Oh! my good Audley, why will you &s;hew me to my&s;elf in &s;uch a hateful point of view! My Friend, my Guardian, my Director, clear my heart, I conjure you, if you can, from all the&s;e wild exce&s;&s;es of a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e tyranny and inju&s;tice I perceive and dete&s;t."
<PB N="191" REF="193">
Here &s;he pre&s;&s;ed my hand in an agony of tears that made me reproach my&s;elf for the idle barba|rity of my que&s;tion, though I hoped to make her ample compen&s;ation for all the pain it occa&s;ion|ed. But before I had time to do &s;o, "Heavens! exclaimed the fond &s;ufferer, what a hideous in|&s;ight have you given me into my own troubled thoughts! how have you made me abhor the turn of mind that I have lately fallen into, and which I never condemned before, becau&s;e I ne|ver under&s;tood the &s;ecret cau&s;e of it till this mo|ment!" Here my curio&s;ity was very &s;trongly excited. I reque&s;ted an explanation. "Do not hate me, my good Audley, &s;aid this ingeni|ous &s;elf-accu&s;er, while I confe&s;s to you, I have lately thought it would be a ble&s;&s;ing to Seymour, to be taken early from the world. I rea&s;oned thus: At pre&s;ent his life can be &s;tained with no important evil; and he has hitherto employed him&s;elf in generous, munificent, and charita|ble deeds. In &s;uch a character &s;urely Heaven will either pardon his youth the unintended crime of incredulity, or in clo&s;ing his exi&s;tence reveal to him in a merciful hour tho&s;e impor|tant truths to which he has hitherto been &s;o un|happily blind. But if his days are prolonged under the tyranny of tho&s;e proud and di&s;ppoint|ed pa&s;&s;ions which have driven him abroad, what calamities may en&s;ue, what a horrid change may be wrought in his noble nature! Thus un|der the idea of &s;ecuring his everla&s;ting welfare, my fond and feveri&s;h imagination has been &s;ometimes inclined to hurry him from the earth. But you have &s;hewn me the hideous &s;ource of the&s;e ideas. I now feel for the fir&s;t time, that they &s;prung from a corrupted heart, labouring
<PB N="192" REF="194">
under a &s;ecret horror of beholding this object, &s;o cruelly dear to me, the hu&s;band of another. Oh!

Let me a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Edmund, that your &s;weet little Fanny is grown, not only dear to us on her own account, but as much at home as if &s;he had been educated here from her cradle. You would be diverted, as I am, to &s;ee what rivals Cornelia, Lucy, and Harriot, are, for the highe&s;t place in her affection. I am convinced, however, this di&s;tinction belongs completely to Cornelia, and from a cau&s;e which does honour to the heart of the dear little dam&s;el. She has ob&s;erved the air of melancholy and mental, or rather cordial di&s;|tre&s;s, which is often vi&s;ible in the &s;weet counte|nance of Cornelia; and this has awakened her early &s;ympathy, and made the tender Fanny attach her&s;elf peculiarly to the widow. She is, however, as &s;prightly and playful as you would wi&s;h her to be; and to give you our idea of her character in a few words (which I &s;hould tell you are the words of Lucy), &s;he has all your en|gaging qualities without one of your foibles.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. FROM SEYMOUR TO CHARLES AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>MOST truly and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully, my dear Audley, have you followed a &s;ublime pre|cept of the Religion which you &s;o happily pro|fe&s;s. You have indeed overcome evil by good. In reading the letter which you &s;o generou&s;ly &s;ent me by our dear unexpected Edmund, I know not which was the &s;tronger, my &s;en&s;e of your extreme kindne&s;s, or of my own demerit. How indulgent, how parental, has your con|duct been towards me! and how ungrateful the return that I have hitherto made to &s;uch fa|vours! But my hour of retribution is come, not only towards you, my dear ill-treated friend, but towards that bright injured angel who&s;e ex|qui&s;ite
<PB N="195" REF="197">
perfections you &s;o nobly endeavour to im|pre&s;s upon my heart. I have, perhaps, towards her
<Q>Beyond atonement &s;inn'd;</Q>
or I &s;hould rather &s;ay, that Heaven will probably, with great ju&s;tice, preclude me from an earthly ble&s;&s;ing, who&s;e real value I have been &s;o &s;low to under&s;tand and acknowledge.</P>
<P>You will undoubtedly have a faithful account from Edmund, who is all kindne&s;s and attenti|on to me, of my real apparent &s;ituation: but you cannot hear from him what I think it be&s;t to conceal at pre&s;ent from the infinitely tender and too anxious friends who &s;urround me; I mean, my own &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion, not only that I &s;hall never behold dear England again, but that I &s;hall drop this poor early-tattered ve&s;t|ment of mortality much &s;ooner than my friend|ly attendants here will allow them&s;elves to ima|gine. Nor &s;hould I, my dear Audley, imparts this idea to you, had I not ob&s;erved with what peculiar ju&s;tice and felicity you have long e&s;ti|mated life and death. For my own part, I am thankful to my Creator that timidity has never been characteri&s;tic of my frame. When my mind was in utter darkne&s;s concerning futurity. I was a &s;tranger to the dread of di&s;&s;olution; and &s;ince that ble&s;&s;ed Power, to whom I was blind too long, has illuminated my &s;pirit with his promi&s;e of a &s;uperior exi&s;tence, &s;ince he has allowed me (to u&s;e the words of a great living Poet who is rich in religious eloquence)

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO HIS BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! my dear Charles, what heart-rend|ing &s;cenes have I had to &s;u&s;tain! but they are pa&s;&s;ed. We have lo&s;t that enchanting friend who&s;e heart I verily believe was the warme&s;t and mo&s;t generous that God ever be&s;towed upon a mere mortal.&mdash;Our beloved Seymour expired ye&s;terday evening. Giuliana and my&s;elf had the grievous, yet delightful office, of catching his late&s;t &s;igh. He died with his head re&s;ting on her bo&s;om, and his hand cla&s;ped in mine.&mdash; No human eye ever beheld a more affecting or
<PB N="204" REF="206">
more enviable death; it was indeed the death of a true Chri&s;tian, and &s;uch as might induce the mo&s;t callous Infidel to renounce his Infideli|ty, and exclaim in a devout triumph,
<Q><L>O Grave, where is thy Victory?</L>
<L>O Death, where is thy Sting?</L></Q>
He had in a mo&s;t &s;ingular degree what he had particularly prayed for the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his faculties to his la&s;t moment; indeed they were rather brightened than impaired.&mdash; I do not remember to have read of any per&s;on except the French Chancellor Seguier, who&s;e intellectual powers appeared with &s;uch lumi|nous vigour in the clo&s;ing hours of life. All the engaging peculiarities of our dear Seymour attended him to the la&s;t. His genero&s;ity, his courage, his imagination, were never more con|&s;picuous than on the day of his decea&s;e &mdash; Through the whole cour&s;e of his malady, he discovered a perfect exemption from that very common and pitiable &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which is &s;o apt, even in noble characters, to &s;pring up with di&s;|ea&s;e, and contaminate the clo&s;ing &s;cene of ma|ny honourable lives. So far from feeling the timidity of an invalid, and being anxious to &s;pare him&s;elf, he con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed his bo|dily &s;ufferings, and accelerated perhaps, in &s;ome degree, his la&s;t moment, by his repeated exer|tions in writing, from which we found it impo&s;|&s;ible to re&s;train him. His long reply to your kind letter he intended to di&s;patch to you im|mediately; but after he had &s;ealed it, he chang|ed his mind, and begged me to enclo&s;e it with a &s;hort billet (which he hoped, he &s;aid, to write
<PB N="205" REF="207">
to Cornelia,) in the fir&s;t packet that I &s;hould &s;end you upon his death; be&s;ides the&s;e letters, he has written others which affected him very much, but he took particular pains that I might not know to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed; a re|&s;erve which &s;urprizes me the more, becau&s;e he has fully talked to me on the di&s;po&s;ition of all his exten&s;ive property, and appointed me his executor. He in&s;i&s;ted on writing his own will, which is by no means a &s;hort one; and it was indeed to the dear invalid a work of con&s;idera|ble labour and pain. He has fully di&s;played in it all the tenderne&s;s and magnanimity of his corrected &s;pirit. I am per&s;uaded that he has not omitted a &s;ingle per&s;on who had any claim, however incon&s;iderable, to his remembrance; at pre&s;ent, however, I will only mention to you a few of his beque&s;ts.&mdash;After giving his landed and patrimonial e&s;tate to his name&s;ake and legal heir, with expre&s;&s;ions of regard and e&s;teem, he di&s;po&s;es of his per&s;onal effects, which are various and valuable. To Cornelia he gives only a picture of him&s;elf, and the watch he wore; but he a&s;&s;igns a con&s;iderable &s;um, from which he reque&s;ts her to take annually an hundred pounds on the birthday of her elde&s;t &s;on, and be&s;tow this &s;um, or more if &s;he thinks proper, as a mar|riage portion on the mo&s;t meritorious humble pair within the wide circle of her patronage. To her elde&s;t &s;on he bequeaths a ca&s;ket of jewels, which he has &s;ealed up him&s;elf, and which is not to be opened till the period fixed for its de|livery, the day when young Sedley &s;hall be of age, a day which the te&s;tator de&s;ires me and Lu|cy, if we are alive, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in celebrating at Sedley-Hall. I believe this legacy is of very
<PB N="206" REF="208">
&s;ingular value. Mo&s;t of the&s;e rare gems belong|ed to the mother of our friend; and as he va|lued them more for her &s;ake than for their own co&s;tly charms, he has ever kept them within his reach; and in his hours of tender regret for her untimely lo&s;s, I have &s;een him ki&s;s her fa|vourite ornament of intermingled emeralds and diamonds with as much fond devotion as a Ca|tholic would be&s;tow on the reliques of a Saint. To balance this beque&s;t to the elder Sedley, he has given his excellent library to the younger boy.

He has bequeathed a ring with a ruby of con&s;iderable value to Dr. Ayton; and with an expre&s;&s;ion borrowed from his favourite Sterne, he bequeaths it as a peace-offering to a true and con&s;cientious mini&s;ter of God, from a man who once thought and &s;poke of him with injurious a&s;perity. Surely no man ever quitted the world with a greater degree either of be|nignity or of courage. The&s;e indeed were his two primary characteri&s;tics; and he di&s;played them to the la&s;t, with the mo&s;t affecting frank|ne&s;s, but without a particle of o&s;tentation.&mdash; When the angelic Giuliana expre&s;&s;ed to him her comfort in beholding him &s;o &s;ingularly free from the fear of death; "O! my good angel, he re|plied, though I leave in this world what the hu|man heart may be allowed to regret, yet &s;urely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the next I can have nothing to fear: I have

done, I acknowledge, &s;ome fooli&s;h and &s;ome wicked things; but I tru&s;t they are fully expi|ated by my &s;incere contrition, and perfect re|&s;ignation to the will of the Almighty. Under circum&s;tances peculiarly trying to a &s;pirit &s;o af|fectionate as mine, perhaps, my dear Giuliana, I could not meet Death &s;o compo&s;edly as you now &s;ee me &s;inking into his arms, if I were not impre&s;&s;ed with an idea that my early departure from the earth, like that of your beloved Peverell, may prove a greater ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ome objects of my regard, than my life perhaps might have proved." In uttering the&s;e words, he ca&s;t a look of inexpre&s;&s;ible kindne&s;s upon me&mdash;for he alluded to a di&s;cour&s;e which had pa&s;&s;ed between us a few days before, and which he had clo&s;ed with this tender and memorable expre&s;&s;ion. "I exult, my dear Edmund, in the idea that my death will ratify your conver&s;ion."&mdash;There could indeed be no &s;tronger per&s;ua&s;ive to Chri&s;|tianity, than the death of &s;uch a Chri&s;tian. Who could refu&s;e to acknowledge the benefici|al influence of Religion, in &s;eeing how it had given both &s;oftne&s;s and energy to a &s;pirit once &s;o impatient of di&s;cipline and advice&mdash;in &s;eeing that it taught him, not only to relinqui&s;h life without murmuring, and ju&s;t at a period when it offered him the very object of his impa&s;&s;ioned idolatry, but to chear his mind with a per&s;ua&s;i|on that his death might prove religiou&s;ly bene|ficial to tho&s;e whom he loved?&mdash;About two hours before he expired, he threw his arms round Giuliana and me, as he re&s;ted between us, and exclaimed with a mo&s;t pathetic fervency of &s;pi|rit, "Oh, God! let me not prove a &s;ource of injurious grief and angui&s;h to the&s;e dear friends.
<PB N="208" REF="210">
&mdash;No, I be&s;eech thee, make me, both living and dead, make me only an in&s;trument of good to all the objects of my affection!"&mdash;Nothing has comforted him &s;o much as the idea that his death may be ultimately more a ble&s;&s;ing than a mis|fortune to Cornelia. In this idea, which he fir&s;t conceived in remarking the angelic &s;tate of mind &s;o vi&s;ible and &s;triking in Giuliana, he has been encouraged by that good angel, ever &s;ince &s;he found that there was no chance of his re|covery, and that it almo&s;t offended him to &s;up|po&s;e he could recover. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe to you all her infinite attention and kind|ne&s;s to her dear patient&mdash;but I mu&s;t mention the manner in which Seymour &s;poke or it.&mdash; As &s;he quitted his room ye&s;terday morning, he &s;aid to me&mdash;"How kind, how admirable is Giu|liana, never to di&s;tre&s;s me by tears!

<P>I grieve to add another piece of painful intel|ligence to this melancholy letter. The good old Seignor is confined by illne&s;s to his bed, &s;o that Giuliana has had double occa&s;ion for all her &s;trength both of mind and body. Her exertions have been almo&s;t &s;upernatural. I believe her father will recover, but I cannot leave her while he continues &s;o ill. I have given orders to &s;e|cure the dear remains of our departed friend in a leaden coffin; and as &s;oon as my worthy old ho&s;t revives, I &s;hall &s;et forth on my return with my mournful charge, and perhaps take my pa&s;|&s;age in &s;ome ve&s;&s;el from hence.

<P>MY ever ardently beloved, though once in|&s;ulted Cornelia! it plea&s;es Heaven to cha&s;ti&s;e my proud and blind barbarity towards you, by taking me ha&s;tily from the earth ju&s;t when I might render its prime ornament my own.

My fluttering &s;pirit is divided between the eager de|&s;ire of &s;ending you a la&s;t farewell, expre&s;&s;ing all my encrea&s;ed, improved, enlightened affection for you, and the anxious dread of giving more pain to that infinitely tender bo&s;om which I have barbarou&s;ly tortured already. O! thou mo&s;t lovely mo&s;t ingenuous of women; with what delight &s;hould I expiate my pa&s;t offences towards thee, by living only to cheri&s;h and applaud thy perfection. But Heaven requires a very differ|ent, a &s;evere expiation: the hand of death is upon me; it tears me from my Cornelia!&mdash; I mu&s;t be either le&s;s or more than man, could I refrain from telling you how I feel in every fi|bre of my heart the unutterable angui&s;h of &s;uch a &s;eparation; yet I acknowledge the graciou&s;|ne&s;s of God, who, in dividing me from an ob|ject &s;o inten&s;ely dear to me, has called me to him&s;elf. O Cornelia! this alone could have enabled me to quit thee thus, I cannot &s;ay with|out pain, but I can &s;ay without a murmur. O Heaven! behold my re&s;ignation, and, if it is meritorious (as I tru&s;t it is), reward it by pour|ing the pure&s;t of thy ble&s;&s;ings on that ju&s;tly va|lued idol of my heart, from whom I depart at thy command.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. FROM MR. AUDLEY TO HIS BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>PREPARED as I was, my dear Edmund, for the grievous event which your la&s;t kind letter imparts to me, it has afflicted me &s;o deeply as to &s;hake even my health. What a bitter i&s;&s;ue to all our friendly hopes and projects! But we mu&s;t not murmur; and it would be particular|ly wrong to do &s;o, when the Almighty and All|wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of events is &s;o gracious as to min|gle con&s;olation with our di&s;tre&s;s. However wrong and mi&s;guided the life of our enchanting friend may have been, he has died the death of the righteous; and we ought not, perhaps, to mourn &s;o deeply for him on earth, when there is joy over him in Heaven: but it is impo&s;&s;ible not to feel extreme pain in the lo&s;s of a being who&s;e qualities were &s;o delightfully engaging. For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, his pathetic farewell to me has made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that my nerves are become almo&s;t as tremu|lous as tho&s;e of our poor Cornelia, who is, I will not &s;ay afflicted, but Affliction it&s;elf. I never beheld &s;orrow more poignant, or indulged with more avidity. She &s;ays, "the angui&s;h of

heart that &s;he endures on this occa&s;ion is a very ju&s;t puni&s;hment for her having thought &s;o inhu|manly that his death would be no misfortune." But I am forgetting, my dear Edmund, that at the time you will open this letter, which I di&s;|patch to wait for you at the port appointed, you will be able to procure &s;peedy, and I hope better intelligence of us all, from tho&s;e who are as ea|ger to fly into your arms in the hour of your landing, as you can be to embrace them. I have a mo&s;t fortunate opportunity of gratifying your wi&s;h in this article; an obliging friend has ju&s;t offered me the u&s;e of his vacant and com|modious apartments in Dover-Ca&s;tle, upon my accidentally mentioning your wi&s;h.

Suppo&s;e our dear mi&s;guided Seymour, whom the indulgence of Heaven has taken to it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;e he had pur&s;ued the u&s;ual cour&s;e of young men; &s;up|po&s;e he had brought a mi&s;tre&s;s or a wife to this country, and in the cruel pride of mortified af|fection had in&s;ulted you with an o&s;tentation of felicity; &s;uch events are by no means rare in human life. I have &s;een &s;ome women &s;upport &s;uch a te&s;t of their fortitude, but not under cir|cum&s;tances &s;o peculiarly painful. You &s;till ima|gine, my generous Cornelia, as you &s;aid, I re|member, on the day when I imparted to you our mo&s;t afflicting lo&s;s, that, if you could but re&s;tore him to life with all the happy lu&s;tre of his enlightened mind, you would chearfully &s;ubmit to the angui&s;h of &s;eeing him united to another. Ah! my gentle friend, this idea is but the tran&s;ient illu&s;ive heroi&s;m of &s;udden and immoderate grief, which, like all the vehement
<PB N="222" REF="226">
pa&s;&s;ions, gives a brief energy to our &s;entiment that nature is unable to &s;u&s;tain. Tru&s;t me, I know you better than you know your&s;elf; and I am convinced, by many remarks which I have occa&s;ionally made on your very tender and a|cute feelings, that, if the &s;uppo&s;ed event had happened, you would have lo&s;t either your life or your &s;en&s;es; and our beloved friend, in&s;tead of being, as he now is, a triumphant angel in Heaven, would have been tortured him&s;elf by the&s;e barbarous effects of his precipitate and vindictive love." "O, my good Audley! I replied, by &s;hewing me how weak I am on every &s;ide, you will lead me, I hope, to the Almighty Source of all &s;trength; you will teach me how to acquire, what I grievou&s;ly want, a more cor|dial obedience, and a more fervent and faithful devotion to God. How criminal mu&s;t I be if I fail to acquire this, when my beloved Seymour has &s;et me &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed example of re&s;ignati|on! But I &s;hall acquire it by degrees. The di|vine &s;pirit which breathes in every line of the precious letter addre&s;&s;ed to me by the dear ex|piring convert, now begins to &s;ooth and to re|animate my heart, as I know that mo&s;t affecti|onate of human beings intended it &s;hould do. You &s;aw, my dear Lucy, how dreadfully weak I was in receiving it; how, in&s;tead of con&s;oling me, it convul&s;ed my whole frame. But this dear, this invaluable letter begins to operate as the &s;ofte&s;t balm to my wounded &s;pirits. I read it con&s;tantly at &s;tated periods of every day, and then lay it on my heart, after the example of poor Caroline; this excellent creature has hard|ly &s;uffered le&s;s than my&s;elf, on the lo&s;s of her generous protector, though our feelings are &s;o
<PB N="223" REF="227">
different. She almo&s;t made me &s;mile ju&s;t now, by a little circum&s;tance that marked her attach|ment to him; and to relieve you a little, my dear friend, from the mournful gloom of what I have written, I mu&s;t attempt to relate it to you. As I pa&s;&s;ed the parlour door, where the Mon|&s;ons happened to be with a friend who had call|ed here to &s;ee them, I heard the voice of Caro|line very loud, and with a tone of indignation very foreign to her nature. I clearly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the words&mdash;"No! good as &s;he is, I &s;hall hate her if &s;he ever loves another man as long as &s;he exi&s;ts!" As &s;oon as I &s;aw Caroline alone, I que&s;tioned her concerning the expre&s;&s;ion which I had accidentally overheard; and, with her native frankne&s;s, &s;he declared it related to me, and had been drawn from her by a very fooli&s;h and ill-timed je&s;t of their vi&s;itor on the probable duration of my grief. You will ea&s;ily believe that my heart was plea&s;ed with her vindication of its truth. I can indeed &s;ay, with the hone&s;t Caroline, that I &s;hould hate my&s;elf were it po&s;&s;i|ble for me to let Seymour have any &s;ucce&s;&s;or in my affection.&mdash;No! my dear Lucy, on that point I know my&s;elf, and fear not. The dear dying prophet him&s;elf has told me, that I &s;hall continue to love him; and every movement of my heart and &s;oul impre&s;s upon me the convic|tion that his prophecy is true.</P>
<P>I have only to implore the Great Searcher of all hearts, to temper and correct the affliction now ari&s;ing from this love; and &s;o to blend it with my love for my children, that the&s;e ar|dent affections, no longer oppo&s;ite, but religi|ou&s;ly united, may form all together the ruling po&s;&s;ion of my life. This, my dear friend, is
<PB N="224" REF="228">
my hope, my belief, my prayer, concerning all the future days that Heaven may allot to me up|on earth. Your excellent brother comforts me by an a&s;&s;urance that time will &s;o far re&s;tore my &s;hattered nerves, as to give me the power of being every thing that I wi&s;h to be to my dear boys. Ah! what feeling &s;pirits they will have! I am both afflicted and delighted by the &s;en&s;ibility with which my dear William conti|nues to &s;hew us his remembrance of that belov|ed object whom even &s;portive infancy cannot forget.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. FROM LUCY TO MR. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>AT length, my dear brother, the long and mournful expected ve&s;&s;el, freighted with death and with affliction, is arrived. The dear re|mains of our haple&s;s enchanting friend are &s;afe on his native &s;hore; and our beloved Edmund, who looks I think more than half dead him&s;elf, though he a&s;&s;ures me his health is much better than it was has de&s;ired me to inform you of his arrival. He is him&s;elf engaged in &s;ettling the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements for the funeral; and I mu&s;t tell you, that we are both as much plea&s;ed as we can be at &s;uch a time by the very flatter|ing marks of attention, e&s;teem, and re&s;pect, which Edmund has found here, on his landing, from the relation of our lo&s;t friend. Every pre|caution has been taken to render my brother's mournful office as little trouble&s;ome as po&s;&s;ible. All things have been kept in readine&s;s here, to conduct the funeral proce&s;&s;ion from hence in any manner that Edmund may direct; and the libe|ral heir of our dear Seymour is waiting at his &s;eat to receive my brother, who had announced to him his intention of attending the remains of the dear decea&s;ed to the vault of the family at Seymour Park. Edmund finds that, without
<PB N="226" REF="230">
driving indecently fa&s;t, he can reach the &s;pot in two days and a half, by cro&s;&s;ing the country; and as he thinks a &s;cene of this &s;olemn nature may make a u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ion on a young mind, he has determined to take little Frances and me with him in one of the mourning-coaches. The fourth &s;eat in this carriage is to be occupied by a per&s;on who&s;e pre&s;ence at this juncture affords me more plea&s;ure than I thought my&s;elf capable of receiving. And now, my dear Charles, can you tell whom I mean? No, I think you can|not! Our beloved Seymour &s;eems to retain, even in his coffin, the enchanting power of &s;ur|pri&s;ing and delighting tho&s;e who love him by new in&s;tances of tenderne&s;s and munificence. This unexpected and welcome per&s;on is the old and venerable Danvers, who has a heart &s;o o|verflowing with grief and gratitude, that he is to me at this &s;ea&s;on one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting companions that I could po&s;&s;ibly have met with, e&s;pecially as the occa&s;ion of his joining our par|ty does &s;o much honour to the heart of the dear friend we lament. As &s;oon as our beloved Sey|mour found there was a probability of his death, he wrote to his cou&s;in, whom he has ever treat|ed as a friend, and who, as he really wanted no increa&s;e of fortune, is, I believe, &s;incerely &s;orry to gain it by &s;uch a lo&s;s. Among a few private reque&s;ts which our Seymour made to his name|&s;ake in ca&s;e of his early death, was the follow|ing, "that whenever the old and infirm in|cumbent &s;hould drop, the living which belong|ed to the proprietor of Seymour Park &s;hould be given to Danvers." It &s;o happened that this aged mini&s;ter died very lately at Bath, while the
<PB N="227" REF="231">
pre&s;ent Mr. Seymour was re&s;iding there, who immediately wrote to Danvers, to acquaint him, with his cou&s;in's intention in his favour. As Danvers, though old, is full of activity and gra|titude, he went to return his per&s;onal thanks for a letter which filled him both with joy and anxie|ty, as it mentioned the illne&s;s of his di&s;tant and con&s;iderate patron. He was actually conver&s;ing with Mr. Seymour in the moment when that gentleman received Edmund's letter, announc|ing the death of our dear generous friend. Judge, my dear Charles, what the good warm-hearted old man's &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t have been at that time: he &s;ays the death of one of his own children did not affect him more; and in truth I believe him. Before he quitted Bath, he entreated permi&s;&s;ion that he might wait to receive the body at Dover, e&s;cort it to the grave, and preach a funeral &s;er|mon on the occa&s;ion. It &s;eems the good old man has a little tincture of profe&s;&s;ional vanity; and in this particular and now almo&s;t neglected of|fice of a Divine he has long taken a very par|donable pride; but he is this moment come in, not only to cut &s;hort the little &s;ketch I was about to give you of his character, but to tell me I mu&s;t in&s;tantly prepare for our mournful proce&s;|&s;ion.&mdash;God ble&s;s you all! I can only &s;ay to our dear Cornelia and Harriot, that I con&s;ider this letter addre&s;&s;ed to them as well as to you.

<P>OUR di&s;tre&s;&s;ing duties are done. The dear remains of that enchanting friend, who &s;till holds his empire over the affections of us all, have been depo&s;ited, with the mo&s;t aweful &s;o|lemnity and univer&s;al &s;orrow, by the &s;ide of his departed parents. O! my very dear Cornelia, though once I confe&s;s I wi&s;hed to have you with me, I am truly glad that we oppo&s;ed your &s;trong de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent at a &s;cene whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I am now convinced by my own experience you would have been utterly unable to &s;upport.

<PB N="229" REF="233">
yet, I prote&s;t to you, the &s;adne&s;s of the &s;pectacle was too much for me, and it was with the ut|mo&s;t difficulty that I continued during the whole ceremony in the church.&mdash;All the numerous dependants and rural neigh|bours of our univer&s;ally idolized Seymour were a&s;&s;embled; the face of genuine &s;orrow was &s;o multiplied, that wherever I turned my eyes &s;ome vi&s;age &s;truck me which reflected back upon me with new force the powerful angui&s;h of my own heart. There were many infirm per&s;ons in the congregation, who owed their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the bounty of the dead. Never &s;urely was any man &s;o young di&s;tingui&s;hed by charity &s;o exten&s;ive and con&s;iderate. The good Danvers did noble ju&s;tice to his virtues, and without varni&s;hing his foibles. This worthy preacher has in truth the rare talent in which, as I told my brother Charles in my la&s;t letter, he has long indulged a very innocent pride. In our journey hither, he &s;pent more than half of each night that we pa&s;&s;ed on the road in compo&s;ing alterati|ons and additions to his occa&s;ional &s;ermon; and I que&s;tion, my dear Cornelia, if your favourite Ma&s;&s;illon him&s;elf ever made an audience weep more by a funeral di&s;cour&s;e: mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly he never delivered one that came more immediate|ly from the heart. This excellent old man was indeed &s;o thoroughly affected him&s;elf, that at la&s;t his feelings became too &s;trong for his powers, and this very circum&s;tance increa&s;ed not a little the pathetic effects of his eloquence. As he drew towards the end of his di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cour&s;e, while all were weeping or &s;obbing around him, he caught the infection &s;o &s;trongly, that his voice began to fail &mdash;he pau&s;ed&mdash;he wept&mdash;he attempted to pro|ceed

May the gracious God, who has called our departed example to his heavenly reward, give us grace and power to per&s;i&s;t in that purer and more perfect tribute to his me|mory; &s;o that all of us who are now mourn|ing for our generous friend and benefactor, by being fond and faithful copies of his Chri&s;|tian merit upon earth, may finally be his a&s;|&s;ociates in the beatitude which this merit has &s;ecured to him in Heaven!</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. FROM CORNELIA TO MRS. MORETON.</HEAD>
<P>WELCOME, mo&s;t cordially: let me again &s;ay, welcome, my dear Loui&s;a, to that country from which you have been ab&s;ent &s;o long, and where &s;ome of tho&s;e friends are &s;till remaining whom you u&s;ed to enchant with the &s;weet plea|&s;antry of your &s;portive youth. I have often grieved at not hearing from you, for all your three pacq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets to me were lo&s;t; and I have hard|ly felt a &s;en&s;ation &s;o joyous, during the long in|terval &s;ince we parted, as I felt on the agreeable &s;urpri&s;e of this charming letter which has told me you are returned. Yet my pre&s;ent joy is very &s;ingularly mingled (as all my joys have been) with regret. In rejoicing mo&s;t heartily on your happy return, I cannot help lamenting that our dear Harriot has not lived to &s;ee a day which was &s;o frequently the object of our hopes and our prayers. With the fond incon&s;i&s;tency of affection, I have almo&s;t wi&s;hed to call her back from Heaven, that &s;he might &s;hare with me in the delight of receiving our long lo&s;t Loui&s;a, whom her warm heart never cea&s;ed to love as a child of her own. Ah, Loui&s;a, I have indeed been &s;ingularly familiar with afflic|tion
<PB N="237" REF="241">
&s;ince we bade each other farewell at our be|loved Audley-Grove. Never did any mortal lo&s;e two more valuable friends than I lo&s;t in the late dear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of that lovely &s;pot. But I have learnt to be very grateful to Heaven, for having lent them to me &s;o long, and at a &s;ea&s;on when I had &s;uch bitter occa&s;ion for all the balm of their friend&s;hip, in&s;tead of murmuring at the heavy lo&s;s I have &s;u&s;tained in their decea&s;e. I had the melancholy &s;atisfaction of attending them both in their la&s;t hours; and mu&s;t tell you that they both died, as they had lived, models of tenderne&s;s and fortitude. I ought certainly to grieve the le&s;s, from our dear Harriot's hav|ing left me (to u&s;e her own lively expre&s;&s;ion) her corrected and embelli&s;hed &s;elf in her daugh|ter, who, as the dear ingenuous parent truly &s;aid, has all her good qualities, without her particular foible, if that indeed ought to be reckoned a foible which rendered her &s;o very dear to us all; I mean, a little exce&s;s of &s;pirit, and eagerne&s;s in projects that &s;he loved to form for the advantage of her friends. Her milder and blooming Lucy is now, I think&mdash;but po&s;itively I will not tell you, as I was going to do, what &s;he is; you &s;hall &s;ee, and judge for your&s;elf. I will only &s;ay, &s;he is as impatient to embrace you as I am; and, in truth, my dear Loui&s;a, except my two boys, or rather young men, as I believe it is high time for us to call them, there is no traveller in the world who&s;e arrival under my roof can delight me &s;o much as yours. I mu&s;t, however, beg your indul|gence in one point, and de&s;ire you to let me re|ceive you, with your noble and happy Colonel, the dear Ea&s;tern little creatures, and all your
<PB N="238" REF="242">
train, not at Sedley-hall, but in St. James's Square. The truth is, I have promi&s;ed my &s;ons, who are now returning from Italy, to be waiting for them in London the week after this. You, I am &s;ure, will readily pardon a mother for not breaking &s;uch an appointment. As my &s;ons are &s;o unfa&s;hionable as to &s;ay they &s;et a high value on their mother's &s;ociety, and as they are certainly to me the mo&s;t intere&s;ting companions in the world; I have lately taken into my own hands again our great London hou&s;e, and hope to play the chearful hou&s;e-keeper to them both till one of them &s;hall de&s;ert me for a wife; a kind of de&s;ertion that I &s;hall be more &s;olicitous to encourage than prevent. Come then, my dear Loui&s;a, to a hou&s;e where you know there is plenty of room for us all, and where, believe me, your pre&s;ence will add not a little to the gaiety and happine&s;s of the dome&s;tic circle. To &s;hew you how very free I intend to be with you, and that I do not &s;tand in awe even of your mi|litary lord, I &s;hall begin to &s;cold you on paper for your abominable flattery. Surely, my dear, you mu&s;t have brought home with you all the Ea&s;tern arts of adulation, &s;ince you can addre&s;s &s;uch fine flouri&s;hing per&s;onal compliments to a &s;imple, quiet, motherly woman, not far from forty, who has been for &s;ome years &s;o perfectly emancipated from all the per&s;onal vanities of her &s;ex, that &s;he lives only in her children. Ah, Loui&s;a, my former and more &s;elfi&s;h life was a &s;ad troubled &s;cene, as you know but too well. Heaven grant that my new life (in which &s;elf has truly as little to do as po&s;&s;ible) may be more tranquil and more fortunate! It will be hard upon me indeed if, after being al|mo&s;t
<PB N="239" REF="243">
a martyr my&s;elf to a calamitous pa&s;&s;ion, I am de&s;tined to &s;ee my children &s;uffer from any haple&s;s affection. I have endeavoured to guard again&s;t this evil by every precaution in my pow|er. I have done every thing that I could do to render my&s;elf a plea&s;ing companion and a bo|&s;om friend to my &s;ons. Alas! how weak and fruitle&s;s are &s;uch expedients again&s;t all the perils of pa&s;&s;ion! Ah, my friend, the dear youths are ju&s;t arrived at that &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on. Can I think of &s;cenes that you and I &s;o well remember, and not tremble for them? O Loui&s;a, I have an ad|ditional circum&s;tance to quicken my anxiety. I did not mean to communicate to you in this let|ter what I now feel an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e to im|part to you. You know what an eager benevo|lent projector our dear Harriot was on the wide and dangerous &s;ea of affection, in bequeathing to me the care of her &s;weet Lucy; it was the fond hope of her friendly and maternal heart, that the dear girl's re&s;iding with me might ulti|mately make her the wife of my elde&s;t &s;on. The connexion would delight me as much as it could have delighted my dear departed friend; but, alas! how chimerical and how perilous in ge|neral are &s;uch di&s;tant parental projects! I &s;aid all that di&s;cretion could urge again&s;t her idea; but you know the affectionate vehemence of our dear Harriot; and your quick &s;pirit will conceive in a moment how full of hopes and fears, of a thou&s;and delicate and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing per|plexities, my pre&s;ent &s;ituation mu&s;t be. Your chearful and benevolent &s;pirit &s;eems re&s;tored to me by Heaven, to give me new animation at this critical period. My &s;ons have been ab&s;ent from me almo&s;t two years; but I have great
<PB N="240" REF="244">
rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with their conduct and their improvements in that time. They are re|turning to make their fir&s;t appearance in the world. William will be of age in le&s;s than two months, and a &s;eat is prepared for him in parli|ament, where I have &s;et my heart on his prov|ing what his independent father, and a certain per&s;on who loved him al&s;o with paternal affec|tion, often prophe&s;ied that he would prove; I mean, a manly and ingenuous character, equally di&s;tingui&s;hed by talents and integrity. I think you will &s;mile, my dear and &s;till &s;portive Loui&s;a, when you &s;ee how far maternal love has made a politician and a patriot of me, in the &s;imple and good &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e hacknied words. But of this and a million of other mat|ters when we meet. Come, and call me old Polonius in petticoats if you plea&s;e, provided you will but a&s;&s;i&s;t me in promoting the happi|ne&s;s of the dear young Ophelia. Deuce take this ill omened allu&s;ion, which has in it an air of propriety in one &s;en&s;e that wounds me; for, between our&s;elves, I am already convinced that the dear girl loves the young prince more than the young prince appears to love her. God forbid he &s;hould ever drive her to di&s;traction! If he does, he de&s;troys us both. O Loui&s;a, a charge &s;o delicate pre&s;&s;es upon my mind and heart with a formidable weight.

Cornelia, famous as &s;he is (like Brutus him&s;elf) both for gentlene&s;s and fortitude. But, in plain Engli&s;h, my very dear Friend, let me return you a thou&s;and thanks for your mo&s;t affectionate letter; and, above all, for the dear communica|tion of a &s;ecret &s;o precious; it delights, it en|chants me. Ble&s;s the memory of my charm|ing aunt Harriot! She was indeed an affec|tionate projector. But though &s;he failed in one of her darling &s;chemes, her projects were generally &s;ucce&s;sful. This her po&s;thumous project, as I may call it, has quite &s;et me on fire with zeal to a&s;&s;i&s;t in its completion. Courage, my excellent friend, thou mo&s;t delightful of guardians and mothers. What &s;hould we fear? Cannot you and I (adroit and experienced as we are in affairs of Love) cannot we ea&s;ily ma|nage the pliant hearts of an ingenuous youth of twenty-one and a &s;weet &s;imple blooming girl of eighteen. I warrant you: tru&s;t me, my dear, they &s;hall be a pair of amorous obedient puppets in our hands. We will &s;o pull and direct the wire of their ductile pa&s;&s;ions, that they &s;hall re|pre&s;ent for our plea&s;ure the mo&s;t intere&s;ting dra|ma in the world. We know indeed that, in the common puppet-&s;hows of Love and Matrimony, the Devil plays a very bu&s;y and tyrannical part; but in ours he &s;hall not exhibit even a nail's breadth of his cloven foot. No my dear, it &s;hall be all virtue, harmony, and delight. Well, I am returned at a happy juncture indeed, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in preparing the machinery for &s;uch an enter|tainment. But, my good Cornelia, when we have taught this lovely young couple to be deeply and furiou&s;ly enamoured of each other, you mu&s;t not come forth with a common matronly
<PB N="243" REF="247">
maxim, "that early wedlock is imprudent, that mi&s;&s;es &s;hould wait till they are twenty-five," &amp;c. &amp;c. Po&s;itively I will have nothing to do with any &s;cheme of keeping two lovers in a flaming purgatory for I know not how many years. For my part, I think of marriage as Macbeth talks of murder:
<Q><L>If it were well when it is done, 'twere well</L>
<L>It were done quickly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Note by the Editor.</P><P>Loui&s;a has here quoted Shake&s;peare very inaccurately; but her inaccuracy gives at lea&s;t a clear meaning to a pa&s;&s;age quaint and ob&s;cure.</P></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>A good match, in my <HI>not humble</HI> opinion, can hardly be celebrated too &s;oon. The objection mo&s;t univer&s;ally urged again&s;t early marriage de&s;erves, I think, no con&s;ideration at all. The people who fear that their children may tread too clo&s;ely on their heels do not de&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ing of a child; and had better not marry till they can e&s;cape all probability of &s;uch an incumbrance You &s;ee, my dear friend, I have brought home again my old romantic &s;pirit. All the heats of India could not draw it out of me. But you and I &s;hall hardly differ on this article; and, if we do, we &s;hall have time enough to adju&s;t our re&s;pective opinions in amicable debate. At pre|&s;ent I &s;cribble in extreme ha&s;te, to &s;alute you with my thanks and ardent good wi&s;hes before you &s;et forth for the great city. A good journey to you, and a mo&s;t happy meeting with the dear travellers, whom you mu&s;t expect with the mo&s;t affectionate impatience. Poor Ireland mu&s;t for|give me if I am more &s;low than I ought to be in paying my filial duty there. My &s;in &s;hall be

<P>DISTANT as I am from you, I can turn to you only for coun&s;el in a mo&s;t cruel &s;urprize and con&s;ternation that almo&s;t robs me of my &s;en&s;es. On my arrival here, I find an anonymous letter left for me at this hou&s;e; of which I inclo&s;e you a copy. For Heaven's &s;ake, tell me what I ought to think of it. I am di&s;tracted with a thou&s;and contradictory ideas. Is it only a bar|barous trick to torment me? Yet whom can I have provoked to &s;uch inhumanity of malice? Is it an artifice to gain money? Alas! I am ready enough to relieve the indigent without forcing them into fraud. Is it, finally, a cala|mitous truth, that mu&s;t render my latter days more wretched than my early life? GOD in his mercy forbid! Surely, if &s;uch peril exi&s;ted, the &s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t, and vigilant Mon&s;on mu&s;t have perceived it, and would have given &s;ome notice of it before this time either to me or to you.

<P>THOUGH I mu&s;t confe&s;s that &s;elf-intere&s;t, or rather pa&s;&s;ion, is the prime motive to this let|ter, in which I mu&s;t &s;urprize and give you pain, yet be a&s;&s;ured I mean well to you, and we may prove very u&s;eful friends to each other; though for various rea&s;ons, you mu&s;t excu&s;e my adding a name to this unexpected epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;&s;ure you, however, that I am a gen|tleman, and &s;ubject, I own, to many of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing follies too often found in that charac|ter. My pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s is of &s;uch a kind, as you I am &s;ure, if you are the amiable and indul|gent and generous parent that I have heard you repre&s;ented, will be mo&s;t ready to pity. It is di&s;tre&s;s of heart, ari&s;ing from a pa&s;&s;ion certainly not wi&s;e in its exce&s;s, and, I mu&s;t own, not the mo&s;t honourable in its purpo&s;e; yet, under a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o circum&s;tanced, I am bold enough to hope and to &s;olicit your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, even while I regard you as a paragon of virtue, becau&s;e in a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, you may probably pre&s;erve your elde&s;t &s;on, who is above all prai&s;e of mine, from
<PB N="248" REF="252">
the imminent hazard of wretchedne&s;s and di&s;|honour.</P>
<P>Be not too much alarmed, my good lady; and let me conjure you, by all that is dear to us both, to trea&s;ure up in your own brea&s;t the very important &s;ecret which I am going to con|fide to your honour and your di&s;cretion. If you make any imprudent, any ungenerous, any unguarded u&s;e of it, we are both ruined; for, unconnected and different beings as we are, this momentous &s;ecret, my dear Madam, involves the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery both of your life and mine. Perhaps if you will conde&s;cend to let the writer of an anonymous letter have a private conference with you, and will give him your word of honour, not to betray your know|ledge either of him or his de&s;igns; perhaps in this ca&s;e I may conver&s;e with you on a topic &s;o painfully intere&s;ting to us both, for I have a thou&s;and things to &s;ay that I cannot crowd into a letter. But let this be as we may find expedi|ent hereafter. My pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be to give you as clear an idea as I can upon paper of certain circum&s;tances, which threaten much angui&s;h to your maternal heart, and have al|ready given tortures of a very different nature to mine.</P>
<P>In explaining this my&s;tery, I had better, I think, &s;ay too much than too little. Perhaps, Madam, as you have lived, I under&s;tand, a mo&s;t virtuous, happy, and retired life, perhaps you know not even the name of a mo&s;t celebrat|ed fair creature, who, though confe&s;&s;edly not a model of virtue, is univer&s;ally reckoned the mo&s;t bewitching object that was ever followed by licentious idolatry. The per&s;on I mean is the
<PB N="249" REF="253">
famous Emily Belmont: &s;he is the daughter of a decea&s;ed Briti&s;h general by a Venetian ac|tre&s;s; and inherits, not all the opulence, but all the &s;pirit, and all the captivating qualities of both her parents. After being the mi&s;tre&s;s of three peer and two commoners, and after re|jecting offers of marriage from an elderly duke and a young vi&s;count, Emily went la&s;t year to Rome with lord T&mdash;. In Italy, for our mu|tual inquietude, I fell in love with her; and &s;he fell in love with your elde&s;t &s;on. As Emily p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ques her&s;elf on a peculiar frankne&s;s or &s;pirit, &s;he told me very hone&s;tly, that &s;he had given her whole heart to Sedley. "To Sedley (&s;he &s;aid in a tone that expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s) to Sedley, more beautiful than all the boa&s;ted marble Gods and heroes in this coun|try; and, alas, half as cold!'&mdash;So far her ge|nero&s;ity told me, to effect my cure. But &s;he did not tell me what I had the addre&s;s, or, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, the good luck to di&s;cover, by a certain female friend of hers; I mean, that her love to Sedley was utterly unlike all the at|tachments that &s;he had hitherto formed. She is &s;eriou&s;ly in love, and for the fir&s;t time in her li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e It is the great ambition of her heart and &s;oul to make her&s;elf the wife of your &s;on. She is now pur&s;uing this point with &s;uch a mixture of cordial &s;incerity and refined artifice, as tho&s;e only can thoroughly conceive who have had op|portunities of &s;tudying her very &s;ingular and fa&s;cinating character. I have kept the keen eyes of jealou&s;y upon all her movements, and can fortunately apprized of all her private ma|chinations. She has animated the marble who&s;e coldne&s;s made her &s;igh; &s;he has wound
<PB N="251" REF="255">
up the pa&s;&s;ions of her young Adonis, by grant|ing him many indulgences that could excite, and not one that could abate, the fervency of de&s;ire. She has produced in him what all her exqui&s;ite talents and attractions have been ex|erted to produce, a &s;entimental delirium. In &s;hort, my dear Madam, affairs have been thus &s;ettled between them. The fair penitent, ex|pre&s;&s;ing a graceful horror for her former illicit life, has de&s;erted Lord T&mdash;, and is already in London. Your &s;on, who cannot, I think, be here under a fortnight, has promi&s;ed that he will not attempt to &s;ee her till he has &s;ettled all his concerns at the important period of his being of age, which I under&s;tand is very near; and in the following week they are to be privately married.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Madam, I am confident that you are as eager as I am to counteract with your whole heart and &s;pirit this alarming de|&s;ign. But how to do &s;o is the grand que&s;tion. For Heaven's &s;ake, do not tru&s;t to your mater|nal influence. You are indeed as &s;incerely be|loved by your &s;on as a mother can be; but what are the entreaties or the commands of a parent to a young man who&s;e more imperious love has been &s;o artfully excited? Tru&s;t me, &s;uch commands are but chains of flax, that are in&s;tantly burnt a&s;under in the flames of oppo&s;ed de&s;ire. I &s;peak from fatal experience. Pardon me if I &s;peak too &s;trongly; but what is to be done? I have long cracked my brains to find the mo&s;t effectual expedient, and to &s;ave you at the &s;ame time from all painful explanations, and all di&s;&s;ention with your &s;on. I think I have found this expedient, if I can per&s;uade you,
<PB N="250" REF="254">
Madam, to conde&s;cend &s;o far as to have a &s;e|cret interview with a female in a rank of life &s;o different from your own. But on this point, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, your pure and noble heart will not he&s;itate for the pre&s;ervation of your child.</P>
<P>Emily notwith&s;tanding her frailties, is in truth a creature of &s;entiment and &s;oul. In her heart and under&s;tanding, even you, Madam, will find much to admire; for I may ju&s;tly &s;ay (&s;etting a&s;ide the fond prejudice of a lover) that &s;he has every female virtue except cha&s;tity. I cannot give you a more forcible idea of her character, than by telling you what is literally true, that &s;he quitted a certain earl, who loved her pa&s;&s;ionately, for no other rea&s;on but to re|&s;tore the injured health of his &s;i&s;ter, a lady of tender &s;pirits, and of a &s;crupulous con&s;cience, who made her&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly unhappy from her brother's illicit attachment. I happened to learn all the particulars of Emily's very &s;ingular and generous conduct on this occa&s;ion; and they &s;ugge&s;ted to me the fir&s;t idea of the plan that I am now recommending. I know that this accompli&s;hed, though frail beauty, has a noble mind, that abhors the idea of proving a &s;ource of inquietude to any amiable family. I al&s;o know, my dear Madam, that &s;he has a ve|ry great and tender veneration for your charac|ter; and I will tell you how &s;he acquired it, by being indulged in the privilege of reading your letters to your &s;on, which I have heard her commend as the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite letters that ever flowed from a parental pen; and in points of literature, &s;he is allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s great di&s;cern|ment and delicacy of ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="256">Now, my dear Madam, &s;ituated as you are, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, as I have heard, the mo&s;t in&s;i|nuating &s;weetne&s;s of manners; what influence may not you hope to gain over the feeling and generous Emily, if you will conde&s;cend to con|ver&s;e with her on the great object of our terror! You mu&s;t not, however, betray me, however tempted you may be to do &s;o. This would ef|fectually ruin our hopes. But you may &s;ay, that certain hints have been given you by the tutor of your &s;on; that maternal anxiety made you re&s;olve to obtain an interview with a per&s;on whom you have heard very &s;ingularly com|mended, both for genero&s;ity and truth. Emily is indeed a model of both; and I que&s;tion if any mortal exi&s;ts in either &s;ex that has a more magnanimous di&s;dain of uttering a lie. If you can but contrive to &s;ee her in private, of this you may be &s;ure, that although &s;he may not perhaps think it prudent or ju&s;t to your &s;on to acknowledge to you the whole truth, yet &s;he will not attempt to deceive you by any ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood. As I under&s;tand, Madam, that you are very opulent, I could wi&s;h you to make a forcible impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of Emily, by a liberal unexpected offer of promoting her inde|pendence. What &s;um might be &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e I cannot preci&s;ely &s;ay; but I fancy it might be done upon terms very ea&s;y to you. I know &s;he has a private revenue, not incon&s;ider|able, though not equal to her wi&s;hes, becau&s;e I have heard her &s;ay, that if &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an in|dependent income to a certain amount &s;he would &s;ettle her&s;elf for life at a favourite &s;pot on the Continent.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="257">Perhaps your maternal tenderne&s;s and gene|ro&s;ity may incline you to give her the power of gratifying this de&s;ire, as the noble&s;t means of obtaining from her the great &s;acrifice of her ve|ry dangerous attachment to your &s;on; yet, &s;up|po&s;ing you are willing to do &s;o, I have &s;till &s;ome doubts whether it may be po&s;&s;ible even for you. to prevail on the high-&s;pirited Emily to accept your bounty. This I perfectly know, &s;he would not accept &s;uch a gratuity from any <HI>man</HI> breathing. Perhaps to a lady of your admira|ble character her very &s;ingular and hone&s;t pride may feel it&s;elf more indulged than mortified in being materially indebted. In this article I am really unable to judge how &s;he may act; but you will have a &s;till more effectual expedient for preventing the dreaded marriage by &s;hewing her, with mild maternal eloquence, the mi&s;ery it mu&s;t produce, not &s;o much from her rank in life (for there I know your genero&s;ity will &s;pare her) but from the no le&s;s material inequality of age; for Emily is at lea&s;t nine years older than the youth &s;he loves; but, alas, at thirty &s;he is a thou&s;and times more fa&s;cinating than all the younger dam&s;els in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>At length, my dear Madam (pray let our mutual hopes and fears excu&s;e the familiarity of my addre&s;s), at length I have &s;aid to you all that I think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay in a letter, for the prolixity of which I &s;hould apologi&s;e, if that prolixity had not been occa&s;ioned by my earne&s;t de&s;ire to gratify the natural curio&s;ity of the ami|able parent whom I have been obliged to alarm for the honour and happine&s;s of her child. Pray con&s;ider what I have &s;aid with your be&s;t judg|ment, but without con&s;ulting too many friends;

and have the goodne&s;s to let me know what &s;teps you think it mo&s;t prudent to take at this very alarming and critical time.

<P>BEFORE I can receive your an&s;wer to my la&s;t di&s;tracted letter, I think my&s;elf bound to

give you the &s;atisfaction of knowing that I am a little relieved from my extreme perturbation, though not, alas! from my chief terror, by the &s;udden and unexpected arrival on the dear a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|mating Loui&s;a. This warm-hearted, friend has left her noble Colonel with his aged father; and being as impatient to &s;ee my boys as I am, &s;he has kindly flown with her u&s;ual vivacity to wait with me here, to welcome their return. She could not have arrived at a more &s;ea&s;onable mo|ment; the &s;ight of her has afforded me inex|pre&s;&s;ible comfort. I have opened my full heart to her, which gave me the more ea&s;e, as I had carefully concealed the horrid contents of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing anonymous letter from my dear lit|tle tender Lucy. It would have co&s;t her many pangs of the heart, not le&s;s bitter than tho&s;e I endure; and it &s;hall be the con&s;tant &s;tudy of my life to &s;ecure this &s;weet girl as much as po&s;|&s;ible from pain, if I cannot e&s;tabli&s;h her happi|ne&s;s in the manner I would wi&s;h.</P>
<P>By Loui&s;a's advice, I have ju&s;t di&s;patched a billet to my anonymous corre&s;pondent; and, having &s;uch a &s;econd in my lively friend, I have ventured to invite this terrific Unknown to a private conference in my own hou&s;e. I hope I have not done wrong; but I &s;hall be content to wander a little from the &s;trait line of propri|ety and decorum, if I can but pre&s;erve this dear impa&s;&s;ioned boy.

<HEAD>LETTER LV. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO CORNELIA.</HEAD>
<P>MODERATE, I be&s;eech you, my very dear friend, the fond exce&s;s of your maternal apprehen&s;ions. Though I mu&s;t confe&s;s you have puzzled your privy coun&s;ellor, &s;till I main|tain that you ought not to harra&s;s your tender &s;pirit, by giving way to the wor&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions of your affectionate terror. Surely we have time enough before us to prevent any &s;erious mi&s;chief from this impending danger, whatever it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. After repeated peru&s;als of the alarm|ing letter, I am utterly unable to form a &s;ettled
<PB N="258" REF="262">
opinion whether this threatened danger is real or fictitious; but I &s;trongly incline to believe the latter. There have been &s;o many accom|pli&s;hed and ingenious per&s;onages ruined of late by di&s;&s;ipation, and reduced to prey upon unwa|ry opulence by the dexterity of their devices, that fraud, like many of the nobler arts, has been cultivated and refined among us to a &s;ur|prizing degree. From many anecdotes which I have lately heard of this kind, I am led to &s;u&s;|pect that your anonymous letter forms a part of a &s;ubtly-fabricated project, to draw a con&s;idera|ble &s;um of money from the unguarded pur&s;e of a mother, who&s;e opulence is well known, and who&s;e tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity cannot have e&s;caped the notice of any keen nece&s;&s;itous ad|venturer, who might wi&s;h to draw from them, by fradulent ingenuity, an immediate &s;upply for his di&s;tre&s;s. You may reckon me perhaps a too timid and &s;u&s;picious reclu&s;e, when I pro|phe&s;y that your terrific Unknown and his boa&s;t|ed Emily will turn our two profligate worthle&s;s characters, not utterly unlike our old acquain|tance Don Raphael and Camilla in Gil Blas. It strikes me as a capital &s;troke of pecuniary con|trivance in a nece&s;&s;itous courtezan, to practi&s;e on the liberal fondne&s;s of a mother, by pretend|ing to &s;acrifice a perilous pa&s;&s;ion for her &s;on. I give Emily (however hand&s;ome or plain &s;he may be) great credit for this idea; but I mu&s;t give you al&s;o one caution, my very dear and gene|rous friend. If you really feel di&s;po&s;ed in this bu&s;ine&s;s (as I know you can afford it) to throw away a con&s;iderable &s;um, rather than enter in|to a painful perhaps, and rather indelicate ex|planation with your &s;on, I entreat you let the
<PB N="259" REF="263">
money be paid in Paris, and to the formidable lady in per&s;on. This point your friendly bank|er will readily manage for you with great ea&s;e; and I think, if you generou&s;ly incur any &s;uch expence, you ought to be rewarded by the mo&s;t perfect a&s;&s;urance that the fair object of your alarm is &s;afely out of the kingdom. I have lived &s;o &s;eque&s;tered a life for &s;ome years, that I know almo&s;t as little of this celebrated Emily as you can do. I am indeed acquainted with her name, and I know a channel by which I can &s;peedily obtain the fulle&s;t information in re&s;pect to her real character. For this I will immediately ap|ply, and have it di&s;patched to you with the ut|mo&s;t &s;ecrecy and expedition. You judge very generou&s;ly and very ju&s;tly of Mon&s;on: he men|tioned once, but very &s;lightly, this alarming fair-one in a letter to me; but his apprehen&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided, and if any &s;ort of connexion exi&s;ts between the parties (which I do not believe), it has completely eluded his vigilance: this cir|cum&s;tance it&s;elf is highly improbable; and the more I ponder on the whole affair, the more I am per&s;uaded the all-accompli&s;hed Emily will be found only <HI>a delicate Impo&s;tor.</HI> Whatever &s;he may prove, I fore&s;ee that you will be tempted both to &s;ee and conver&s;e with her. What mo|ther with &s;uch feelings as yours would not feel curious to &s;ee a fair creature, who de&s;perately loves, or de&s;perately pretends to love, a &s;on &s;o idolized by her&s;elf? Well, my dear friend, you are certainly a privileged character, and I &s;ee no mi&s;chief that can en&s;ue from your indulging &s;uch a de&s;ire, except perhaps the trifling mi&s;|chief of your being tempted by the noblene&s;s of your nature to throw away more money than
<PB N="260" REF="264">
the object may de&s;erve. But if the haple&s;s fair creature &s;trikes your fancy, and intere&s;ts your feelings, you may &s;urely indulge your&s;elf in the charitable plea&s;ure of putting a few loo&s;e hun|dred pounds in her pocket, and &s;end of the beau|tiful jade to the Continent. I am per&s;uaded my young friend William will be too happy in his return to you, to grieve very long for the ab|&s;ence of &s;uch a lady; and I am &s;till more per|&s;uaded that he is much too wi&s;e to have ever &s;e|riou&s;ly thought of marrying a courtezan who is almo&s;t twice as old as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That I may reply to you as rapidly as po&s;&s;i|ble, I will only add our united love, and our cordial prayers, that you may be thoroughly re|paid for your pre&s;ent cruel inquietude, and for every pa&s;t &s;uffering, by &s;eeing the dear object of our general anxiety as happily married as we all wi&s;h him to be. Lucy the elder gives a deep &s;igh for her dear young name&s;ake on this occa|&s;ion. But I repeat, my excellent Cornelia, you and my &s;i&s;ter are frightened too much.

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII. From CORNELIA to EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>COMFORT! comfort! my very dear, though too timid and too courageous friend. In one, and, alas! the great important point, you confide too much in the di&s;cretion of the dear en&s;nared youth; but, in regard to other per&s;ons and circum&s;tances, your &s;u&s;picions and your fears have outrun the truth.&mdash;No! my dear cautious coun&s;ellor, the terrific Unknown is not a <HI>Don Raphael,</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you.

<P>I have &s;o much to tell you, and am &s;o flurried between joy for what has pa&s;&s;ed, and apprehen|&s;ion of what may &s;till happen, that I hardly know how to begin relating you to the many things that I wi&s;h to you hear. Fir&s;t, for my <HI>Unknown,</HI> I am bound, as you will &s;ee, by the two

enclo&s;ed billets which pa&s;&s;ed between us, and which I &s;end you as an apology for my re&s;erve; I am bound, I &s;ay, not to tell you who he is. But have a little patience, my very dear and affectionately curious friends! by to-morrow's po&s;t a certain per&s;on, without any treachery, will impart to you this teazing &s;ecret, which (though I hope the &s;age Edmund will bear the inquietude it may give him like a man) our dear and truly feminine Lucy the elder will be dying to know. Let me ju&s;t &s;ay for her relief, that this alarming Unknown is a per&s;on for who&s;e welfare and reputation I am intere&s;ted in no trifling degree.&mdash;Nay, I ab&s;olutely love him, and certainly not the le&s;s for finding him in|flamed with a vehement pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ame dangerous and enchanting object who has cap|tivated my &s;on.&mdash;My new friend, as you will naturally &s;uppo&s;e, is as eager as I can wi&s;h him to be in his zeal to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the pre&s;ervation of my child. The great wi&s;h of my &s;oul is, to pre&s;erve them both. If I can accompli&s;h this, I &s;hall think my&s;elf ble&s;t indeed! I am more &s;anguine than u&s;ual in my hopes upon the &s;ub|ject, becau&s;e Providence &s;eems inclined to be|friend me, by having conducted &s;ome little in|cidents in &s;uch a manner as to &s;urprize and &s;upport me with unexpected comfort, and I may &s;ay delight. All this riddle will be explained to you to-morrow; at pre&s;ent I mu&s;t only talk to you of the alarming, the dangerous, the at|tractive, the fa&s;cinating, and, let me add with gratitude, the admirable Emily. You have a good gue&s;s, my dear Edmund, at the &s;ecret feelings of a fond mother. I confe&s;s to you, I felt a great longing, to &s;ee this too intere&s;ting

per&s;onage. I have &s;een her; and what will you think of me when I al&s;o confe&s;s, that I am al|mo&s;t as much in love with her as my poor art|le&s;s William, or my more experienced&mdash;? Fie on my &s;lippery pen! it had nearly written the name of my not-to-be-named <HI>Unknown:</HI> but I was &s;peaking of this fa&s;cinating creature, who puts all di&s;cretion to flight in both &s;exes. Never did I behold any female who would be &s;o likely, if I were a man my&s;elf, to make me the ab&s;olute &s;lave of her attractions. In&s;tead of that in&s;olent or alluring vivacity of feature which often marks her condition, the face of Emily has all the exqui&s;ite mode&s;t &s;weetne&s;s and &s;implicity that a painter would wi&s;h to repre&s;ent in a new-created Eve. The charms of her conver&s;ation are &s;till more captivating than tho&s;e of her countenance!&mdash;You will not won|der that I thought them &s;o, when I tell you, &s;he perfectly convinced me that her pa&s;&s;ion for my &s;on is no fictitious, no artificial, no &s;elf-in|tere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion. Believe me (and experience, alas! has made me too good a judge in this parti|cular) it is genuine, ardent, and mi&s;erable love; the love of a woman, unfortunate indeed in her condition, but exqui&s;ite in understanding as in beauty! Fully &s;en&s;ible of her own infelicity and di&s;grace, yet noble enough to be ready to &s;acrifice her fond ambition, which &s;he wants not perhaps the power of indulging, to the real happine&s;s and honour of the youth &s;he loves!&mdash;Oh! ge|nerous Emily, thou ha&s;t my pity, my affection. Now, my dear Edmund, do not laugh at me; do not ridicule that <HI>cullibility of heart,</HI> which, to u&s;e your own abominable phra&s;e, you have &s;ometimes told me, makes a part of my charac|ter;

do not think me an egregious fool, when I tell you what I have done&mdash;a&s;&s;uredly I have not paid too high a price for the &s;atisfaction that I at pre&s;ent enjoy. You remember the advice g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ven me by the friendly Unknown concerning a pecuniary offer to Emily. As many circum|&s;tances, upon the truth of which I could rely, had fully convinced me that this unfortunate fair-one has a very generous heart; I determin|ed that my offer &s;hould be &s;o con&s;iderable, as to make a forcible impression on her feeling &s;pirits&mdash;The large &s;um which, you know, I have &s;aved for the plea&s;ure of pre&s;enting it to my two boys, when each &s;hall become his own ma&s;ter, &s;upplied me mo&s;t conveniently on this occa&s;ion: I felt no &s;cruple in making free with this money, becau&s;e I knew that, if I even ex|pended all which I de&s;igned to give Charles, that dear generous boy would one day tell me that I could not have employed his property more to his deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht, than by making it condu|cive to the pre&s;ervation of his brother. Ani|mated by the&s;e ideas, I went well prepared to be liberal to Emily: after a very long conver&s;a|tion, which co&s;t us both many tears, and in the clo&s;e of which &s;he mo&s;t gracefully acquie&s;|ced in the plan, which I wi&s;hed her to follow, of retiring to the Continent; I pre&s;ented to her a &s;et of notes payable to her&s;elf in Paris, for ten thou&s;and pound. Her reply to me was this, "O! my dear Madam, how you delight and torture me in the &s;ame moment!" -It is indeed a triumph for the wretched Emily to have engaged the tender regard of &s;uch a pure and exalted being as you are: but what would my felicity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave been, if my de&s;tiny had &s;aved me from

Abject as I now feel my&s;elf in your pre&s;ence, allow me, my dear Madam, to imitate in &s;ome degree the noblene&s;s of your mind: of the &s;um which you &s;o generou&s;ly offer, I will accept only as much as may be &s;ufficient to relieve your parental in|quietude, by convincing you that the object of your fear is as far removed from this country as you ju&s;tly wi&s;h her to be&mdash;let me but flatter my|&s;elf that I carry with me your e&s;teem, and you &s;hall find me a voluntary exile. Here a little generous conte&s;t aro&s;e between us, which was at la&s;t amicably &s;ettled by my in&s;i&s;ting on her tak|ing five of the ten thou&s;and; and this &s;he would only con&s;ent to do, on my promi&s;ing to receive it again, whenever opulence, which her &s;uperlative beauty may indeed command, &s;hall enable her conveniently to replace the &s;um that I forced upon her.</P>
<P>Shall I own to you the whole extent of my weakne&s;s? Shall I tell you that I not only wi&s;h to make this beautiful frail-one independent, but I wi&s;hed al&s;o to make her virtuous and de|vout? Here, alas! I have no chance of being gratified: this lovely infidel, who is as far from being a hypocrite as &s;he is from being a &s;aint, unveiled to me her inmo&s;t &s;oul. The fatal phi|lo&s;ophy of France, in which &s;he has been train|ed, has &s;o alienated her mind from all ideas of true Religion, that I could not hope to influence her conduct by any arguments that I might draw from thence.&mdash;Happily, however, for the great object of my immediate anxiety, I found her mo&s;t tremblingly alive to all the motives of honour, &s;entiment and affection. I am con|vinced
<PB N="268" REF="272">
that her love for my &s;on is genuine, by the manner in which &s;he con&s;ented to &s;acrifice her own gratification to his advantage. Though I was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour, by the impa&s;&s;i|oned report of <HI>The Unknown</HI>; I was yet greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to find a per&s;on, who had plunged for &s;ome years in a life of &s;uch &s;plendid infamy, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of feelings &s;o vi&s;ibly acute, &s;o deli|cate, and refined. As to her age, my anony|mous friend mu&s;t &s;urely be mi&s;taken: I cannot believe that &s;he is more than four years older than William: &s;he has at lea&s;t youth enough to make all the mother tremble in my heart. When I think of my poor fond and fiery William's at|tachment, alas! what has this dear &s;imple ar|dent youth to &s;uffer, even on the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible re|gulation of this unfortunate affair! I &s;hould not love him &s;o inten&s;ely as I do, had he been of a nature not framed to feel agony in the lo&s;s of an idol &s;o attractive. I &s;hudder, not only at the thoughts of the angui&s;h which I know his poor guilele&s;s deluded heart mu&s;t feel from di&s;appoint|ed pa&s;&s;ion, but &s;till more from a dread of lo&s;ing his filial affection. Though my &s;on has great tenderne&s;s in his nature; yet he has al&s;o a great portion of that uncontroulable imperious &s;pirit which belongs to mo&s;t of your lordly creatures. If in the delirium of his early love, he believes his pa&s;&s;ion to be under the guidance of virtue, he will not only di&s;obey, but he will even hate me, &s;hould he di&s;cover that I have &s;ecretly la|boured to prevent its indulgence&mdash;O! mer|ciful God! let me not become, I be&s;eech thee, an object of abhorrence to my child&mdash;the very idea convul&s;es my whole frame. Alas! this Emily is &s;o &s;ingularly captivating, and her own
<PB N="269" REF="273">
pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o vehement, that I even doubt her own power of keeping the promi&s;e which I am confident &s;he made to me with cordial &s;incerity. What have I not cau&s;e to apprehend from two beings &s;o unhappily under the dominion of a blind and fatal pa&s;&s;ions, when even I my&s;elf, while; was conver&s;ing with this fa&s;cinating Emily, felt a &s;trange &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vehement and even oppo&s;ite emotions! There were mi|nutes, during our long conference, in which I was almo&s;t tempted to fold her to my bo&s;om with pity and admiration; and there was an in&s;tant in which my brain &s;eemed to be on fire with momentary madne&s;s and horror. From an expre&s;&s;ion that &s;he dropt, a &s;udden idea darted acro&s;s my mind, that it was ju&s;t &s;uch a frail en|ticing &s;orcere&s;s that occa&s;ioned the untimely death death of my ever idolized Seymour.&mdash;All my admiration, all my pity, all my huma|nity, were gone; and I darted upon the poor &s;uppliant creature a look of terror and dete&s;tati|on, which &s;eemed for a minute as &s;he afterwards &s;aid, to annihilate her exi&s;tence. Tears reliev|ed her from the icy and wretched &s;tupefaction which the &s;udden (and to her not perfectly ac|countable) ohange in my countenance produced upon her. In &s;eeing her weep, I began to weep my&s;elf, and &s;o by degrees was &s;oftened into a compa&s;&s;ionate human creature again. But oh, my good old friend! who&s;e experience has giv|en them more rea&s;on than I have, to dread the fierce tyranny of the pa&s;&s;ions in a young ardent frame, &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly dear dear to me as my &s;on? oh, thou dear and never to be forgotten victim of a &s;imilar delirium! oh, my beloved Seymour! if thy purified &s;pirit has any know|ledge

<P>Alas! my dear Edmund, though I began this long letter with &s;ome degree of calmne&s;s and even gaiety, I have now thrown my poor agitated bo&s;om into painful perturbation, by in|dulging perhaps too much the apprehen&s;ions that haunt me.

concerning the movements of his &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;I mu&s;t, however, &s;ay for him, that he could not well have heard of my arrival, as we came in a Portugueze ve&s;&s;el to Li&s;bon; and our return was not notified in the public papers, like the arrival of pa&s;&s;engers in our India &s;hips. Poor Archibald was both delighted and confounded by the unexpected &s;ight of a per&s;on &s;o likely to lecture him &s;everely on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion &mdash; But affection triumphed over fear. The rogue loves me in his heart, which is in truth as warm and as well-meaning a heart as was ever over-heated in the fiery furnace of Love. And now, my dear Lucy, as affectionate pro|jects are in fa&s;h on among us, I will tell you an affectionate project of mine; but be upon your guard: you mu&s;t not at pre&s;ent, for your life you mu&s;t not &s;ay a word of it to the di&s;creet and cautious Edmund.

But, to &s;peak in plain English, I have conceived a mo&s;t eager de&s;ire to make a match for Archibald with a certain niece of yours, named Frances, who is, they tell me, not only a &s;weet character, as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould &s;up|po&s;e a di&s;ciple of yours mu&s;t be, but marvel|lou&s;ly like the lovely woman whom my brother had the misfortune to lo&s;e, when &s;he was ju&s;t going to make him happy, by a fondly expect|ed &s;on and heir, who &s;hared the untimely fate

Pray tell me between our&s;elves, if you think your &s;weet Frances may have a &s;um like this on her marriage. If my idea plea&s;es you, as I confe&s;s it does me, I am per&s;uaded we &s;hall be able to manage &s;o de&s;irable an event; for it is a maxim with me, that a little confederacy of two or three &s;en&s;ible women may guide and fix the pa&s;|&s;ion of an hone&s;t warm-hearted man on any fair object they chu&s;e. Bold doctrine this! yet, be|lieve me, I have &s;een it frequently verified, and hope to do &s;o at pre&s;ent in more in&s;tances than one; I am ju&s;t called away from my paper; but will contrive, if I can, to &s;cribble a little more to you before I &s;eal up this pacquet for the po&s;t.&mdash;Adieu for &s;ome hours!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXI. FROM LUCY AUDLEY TO HER BROTHER EDMUND.</HEAD>
<P>INDEED, my dear brother, we want you here very much. Our poor Cornelia has ju&s;t been &s;urprized, and is almo&s;t di&s;tracted, by a very unexpected letter from this tormenting abominable Emily. There is nothing violent or in&s;ulting in her letter; on the contrary, it is full of the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;pect: but this bewitch|ing creature has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> paid all the money &s;he accept|ed, and &s;eems to intimate, though ambiguou&s;ly, that her motive for this re&s;toration is a di&s;tant hope of a&s;piring to that honour which, with a mode&s;t propriety, &s;he had once, you know, ut|terly renounced.</P>
<P>This intimation, ambiguous as it is, has put Cornelia on the rack: we are all puzzled to ac|count for the contents of this alarming letter; and the more &s;o, as we are certain that the poor enamoured William has not written to his mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;ince he received that epi&s;tle from her which threw him into a wild and wayward melancho|ly. In that point his pride triumphed over his affection: but this perilous affection is ju&s;t blown afre&s;h into a blaze of joy, for he al&s;o has a letter from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, as we learn from Mount Maurice, with the contents of which he is vi&s;i|bly
<PB N="281" REF="285">
tran&s;ported, though our capital &s;py has not yet been able to a&s;certain the&s;e contents. But here is the good zealous &s;i&s;ter of that &s;py: here is Loui&s;a ju&s;t come to tell me the whole my&s;tery, while her brother is imparting it to Cornelia. Emily, it &s;eems, did actually &s;et out for France; but &s;he was recalled, to receive a con&s;iderable legacy ju&s;t fallen to her by the death of a peer, with whom &s;he once lived, and whom &s;he quit|ted (as you will remember we heard) from ge|nerous motives of tenderne&s;s to his &s;i&s;ter. Were this all, we &s;hould perhaps have but little to fear; the wor&s;t is yet to come. Fortune, in her ca|price, &s;eems re&s;olved to lavi&s;h all her favours on this frail and mi&s;chievous beauty. She has ju&s;t received from a certain amorous prince on the Continent the mo&s;t dazzling overtures&mdash;nothing le&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you, than the offer of a &s;plendid e&s;tabli&s;hment for life, and a title of dutche&s;s. This offer the bewitching Emily has enclo&s;ed to her beloved William, in the ardent hope that &s;o &s;triking a &s;acrifice of ambition may atone for all pa&s;t deficiencies in point of cha&s;tity, and induce even his mother to think her not unworthy of his hand. The fond youth, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, is almo&s;t frantic with joy and eagerne&s;s to em|brace the fair, who prefers him to a prince. Mount Maurice told his &s;i&s;ter, "That from the impetuo&s;ity of his young friend in their private conver&s;ation on this topic, he did not believe any power in the world would be &s;ufficient to prevent the marriage:" but the latter part of this information Mount Maurice has very pru|dently re&s;olved not to communicate to Cornelia till you arrive.&mdash;No words can tell you how ve|ry

I ventured ju&s;t now (being alone with him) to touch, though di&s;tantly and lightly, on the ter|rific &s;ubject. I ventured to expre&s;s a hope, that he would never marry without my concurrence. &mdash;He replied, "That, my deare&s;t mother, is more than I mu&s;t promi&s;e even to you."&mdash; "Why &s;o?"&mdash;"Becau&s;e, Madam, the pre|judices

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. FROM LUCY AUDLEY TO HER BROTHER EDMUND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY VERY DEAR BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THOUGHT nothing could di&s;tre&s;s me more than your illne&s;s at this unfortunate time: but I believe I love your child &s;till better than
<PB N="286" REF="290">
your&s;elf; and I have been terrified almo&s;t out of my &s;en&s;es for our dear Frances. Be not how|ever, alarmed; &s;he is &s;afe, I thank Heaven, under my care, after a providental e&s;cape from a mo&s;t alarming accident, which has added to the mi&s;erable confu&s;ion that now reigns, to my infinite &s;orrow, in this troubled hou&s;e. But our dear girl, I mu&s;t repeat to you, is &s;afe; and though &s;he has a &s;evere ga&s;h in the upper part of her left arm, her health is not injured, and her lovely per&s;on not materially disfigured. The mi&s;chief happened not more than three or four miles from this place. A coach full of holiday people, with drunken men and wild hor&s;es, ei|ther accidental or with wanton malice, drove again&s;t your chai&s;e, and over&s;et it. Mo&s;t fortu|nately, the gla&s;s on the &s;ide of our dear Frances was down; but the violence of the &s;hock threw her forcibly forward, cut her left arm with the front gla&s;s, and &s;tunned her for &s;ome little time by beating her head again&s;t the door. Her thick hair very happily &s;aved her from material injury; or we might have lo&s;t, my dear Edmund, the chief &s;upport and delight of your life and mine, by this horrible mi&s;chance. Let us think of this e&s;cape, and be as thankful as we ought to be. The dear Frances behaves with her u&s;ual &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit. Her wound has been dre&s;&s;ed by the intelligent Bren&s;il, who a&s;&s;ures us all, that we have not even the &s;lighte&s;t ill con&s;e|quence to apprehend; the &s;weet girl, however, is much troubled in her mind by a lo&s;s for which &s;he is certainly not to blame, e&s;pecially as that lo&s;s &s;eems to have ari&s;en from her extreme care of the precious depo&s;it with which &s;he was en|tru&s;ted. She had the little mahogany box con|taining
<PB N="287" REF="291">
the ca&s;ket of jewels in her hand at the moment of the mi&s;chance, and &s;uppo&s;es that the &s;hock, which &s;tunned her, threw what &s;he held from her hand into the road. But the confu&s;ion was too great for any thing to be known very clearly. Martha and Stephen confe&s;s, that they thought only of their bleeding young mi&s;tre&s;s; and I believe, indeed, they would both have giv|en all the jewels in the world, if they had been under their care, to have &s;taunched the blood of our idolized Frances. However the evil might happen, the ca&s;ket is lo&s;t; the road has been &s;earched in vain; and I think it proper to &s;end off an expre&s;s to you with this painful in|telligence, as I apprehend you may wi&s;h to &s;end an account of the lo&s;s to London, and perhaps to adverti&s;e &s;ome de&s;cription of the jewels, which nobody can do but your&s;elf. I cannot &s;ay but I am bitterly grieved for the lo&s;s of this ca&s;ket; but what, alas! are the mo&s;t co&s;tly jewels but vain remembrancers of &s;plendid mi&s;ery to per&s;ons &s;o &s;ick at heart as the dear unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s of this noble man&s;ion is at this moment! Her affectionate and gentle &s;pirit is bent indeed to the earth; though, with a &s;weetne&s;s and ge|nero&s;ity peculiar to her&s;elf, &s;he labours to hide her own various afflictions, and exerts her&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to &s;ooth and con&s;ole the immediate vexation of poor Frances.</P>
<P>I have delayed lending this, although the man and hor&s;e have been waiting for it &s;ome hours, to take the chance of a &s;econd &s;earch on the road; but this has been as vain as the former. During this interval, I had &s;ome private conver|&s;ation with Cornelia, that has made me as wretched as her&s;elf. She has been apprized of
<PB N="288" REF="292">
of all the danger from Emily; &s;he has had a &s;ecret conference with her &s;on; it was very &s;hort; and you will judge of her pre&s;ent angui&s;h of mind from my only repeating to you the la&s;t words of that conference: "Reflect, my dear child; and tell me what your feelings will be if you find that the woman you have married is treated with contempt by all the world!"&mdash; "I can an&s;wer you, my dear Madam, mo&s;t clearly: I &s;hall feel proud that my own heart has more ju&s;tice than all the world; and, be|lieve me, I &s;hall return its contempt ten-fold." &mdash;"I have done, thou dear unhappy youth: thou art under the influence of a fatal, though a generous delirium, from which I fore&s;ee it will not be in my power to &s;ave thee. I have only to pray to God, which I do with my whole ach|ing heart, that he will either take me from the earth, or allow me to mitigate in &s;ome future years that exce&s;s of mi&s;ery which I perceive thou art determined to draw upon thy&s;elf."</P>
<P>Alas! my dear Edmund, what a wretched morning is this, to make part of a day mo&s;t eagerly expected and de&s;tined in our vi&s;ions (&s;o cruelly delu&s;ive!) to a general fe&s;tivity of heart!</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t left the dear long-&s;uffering and now overwhelmed Cornelia reclining on her bed, with our angelic Giuliana by her &s;ide. She has one of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive head-achs that ari&s;e from &s;uch perturbation of heart and &s;oul; but this incomparable mother is re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to collect a little &s;trength from repo&s;e, and ap|pear with tolerable &s;erenity at this inau&s;picious fea&s;t, from which &s;he has had &s;ome thoughts of withdrawing, but where, at the intreaty of her
<PB N="289" REF="293">
&s;he has con&s;ented to pre&s;ide. Heavens, what a fe&s;tival! All the hou&s;e &s;eems in trouble, though many know not why, and particularly our &s;weet innocent niece. Poor little Lucy is certainly, as Cornelia &s;ays, deeply enamoured of William; and we have, therefore, made a point of keeping her as much in the dark as po&s;&s;i|ble. This circum&s;tance affects our tender Cornelia &s;o much, that whenever &s;he &s;peaks to this &s;weet girl, &s;he is ready to bur&s;t into tears, yet con|trives to conceal from her the real cau&s;e of her emotion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not detain the me&s;&s;enger any longer, on account of the pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s of the lo&s;t jewels; I will only add, that, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as I am, I will endeavour to draw &s;ome good out of evil, and if po&s;&s;ible chear my&s;elf with the hope that this returning expre&s;s will bring me a better and a more &s;peedy account of your amendment in health than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have had. To hear that your di&s;order has left you, or at lea&s;t is &s;ettled into the &s;afe&s;t appearances, will, I a&s;|&s;ure you, be a very comfortable medicine, to the dejected &s;pirits of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXV. FROM CORNELIA TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>OH my very dear and excellent old friend! why are you not well, and with us, to make the happine&s;s of Cornelia complete?&mdash;Yes the hap|pine&s;s of Cornelia!&mdash;You will leap for joy, in &s;pite of the gout it&s;elf, at tho&s;e welcome words; and my letter, I am confident, will accelerate your recovery; for what cordial in the world is &s;o powerful as unexpected generous joy to &s;uch a warm and benevolent heart? Yes, my dear anxious Edmund, the di&s;tracted mother is made happy&mdash;happy for the fir&s;t time in her life! happy to &s;uch a degree as language is unable to expre&s;s! But you will gue&s;s at the exqui&s;ite nature of my pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations, when I tell you that I have recovered the alienated &s;pirit of my &s;on? He loves me; he obeys me; he will be every thing that I wi&s;h him to be; and the de|light of all delights is, to be indebted, as I am for this unutterable ble&s;&s;ing to the provident ten|derne&s;s, to the godlike &s;pirit, of our beloved Sey|mour!&mdash;Oh, Edmund! I am &s;o wild with tran&s;port, that you will hardly under&s;tand per|haps what I write; yet I &s;hould think my&s;elf an ungrateful wretch, if I did not attempt to

you with my own hand a full hi&s;tory of the ble&s;&s;ed change in my fate. I will begin where your &s;i&s;ter Lucy left off; for &s;he &s;ays &s;he di&s;|patched to you a &s;ad picture of me, reclining on my bed. I had re&s;ted there about an hour quite alone, and felt my &s;pirits a little compo&s;ed by quiet and &s;ilent prayer; when I was agreea|bly &s;urprized by your &s;i&s;ter, with my &s;on Willi|am in one hand, and the lo&s;t ca&s;ket in the other, followed by Giuliana, with her arm round the half reluctant Lucy the younger, who was afraid of intruding.</P>
<P>The warm-hearted and active Mount Mau|rice, being deeply touched by the &s;weet Fran|ces's lamentation for the lo&s;s of the ca&s;ket, had &s;et him&s;elf at day-break this morning to make a very laborious and patient &s;earch to recover it, by examining a watery ditch by the &s;ide of the road, into which Frances imagines &s;he mu&s;t have ca&s;t it in her &s;udden terror of its be|ing cru&s;hed to pieces. When he returned in triumph with his trea&s;ure, Giuliana particular|ly reque&s;ted that the ca&s;ket might be opened immediately in my chamber, and only in the pre&s;ence of the few per&s;ons whom I have men|tioned. You, my dear Edmund, who have known all my fondne&s;s for our lamented friend, will ea&s;ily conceive the emotions of my heart, when your &s;i&s;ter, as your repre&s;entative un|locked this ine&s;timable ca&s;ket, and after taking out the rich jewels (which the young Lucy only was calm enough to admire) delivered two pa|pers to my &s;on; one of the&s;e appeared to be a letter directed to him, which Giuliana entreat|ed him to read aloud.

<LETTER>
<PB N="292" REF="296">
<HEAD>FROM SEYMOUR TO WILLIAM SEDLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM confident, from the endearing &s;pirit of your childhood, that, at the period when I in|tend you &s;hall receive this letter, you will be one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing and accompli&s;hed characters of your time; I hope the ornament of your country, and, above all, the delight of your incomparable mother. At that period the hand which is now writing to you (though I am now but a few years older than you will then be) will be mouldered into du&s;t! My whole frame very &s;en&s;ibly feels the influence of approaching death; but my hand is yet guided by a heart that &s;till glows with a parental anxi|ety for your welfare, and with a mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h to prove a valuable friend to you, even long after the clo&s;e of my exi&s;tence. You will be, my dear William, what I have been, a young man of a high &s;pirit and keen affections, with an affluent fortune; and Heaven will, I tru&s;t, pre&s;erve you from what I con&s;ider as the chief &s;ource of my misfortunes, the early lo&s;s of an ine&s;timable mother! You will, I hope, long have in yours a friend of the &s;weet|e&s;t
<PB N="293" REF="297">
manners, a coun&s;ellor of unque&s;tionable in|tegrity, a guide to whom all the great rulers of the human mind, rea&s;on and habit, religion and love, will con&s;pire, I am per&s;uaded, to render you obedient.</P>
<P>But, my dear William, perver&s;e incidents are very apt to ari&s;e in the life of a young man, which may tempt him, with the be&s;t heart in the world, to que&s;tion both the wi&s;dom and the authority even of &s;uch a guide. The blind ty|ranny of an impetuous pa&s;&s;ion may hurry him into a frantic and re&s;olute oppo&s;ition to this faithful and di&s;intere&s;ted coun&s;ellor, who&s;e pre|cepts, his own con&s;cience will tell him, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;regard and be happy.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Sedley, &s;hould it be ever your lot to fall into circum&s;tances of this kind, be|fore you take any deci&s;ive &s;tep, li&s;ten, I con|jure you, to me, repeatedly peru&s;e the papers I bequeath to you. Alas! who can be more qualified by experience than I am, to &s;peak as a monitor to any young man under the impul&s;e of a dangerous de&s;ire; for who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have been more precipitate or more fatal than mine? But I mean not, my dear William, to give you a tedious &s;ermon on a hacknied &s;ubject, the blindne&s;s and the perils of youthful pa&s;&s;ion. I am the le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to talk to you, my young friend, of &s;uch perils, becau&s;e, if I have read your future character with a ju&s;t prophetic eye, you will be as aver&s;e as I have been to be influ|enced by the mere &s;elfi&s;h motives of fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or caution. But you will po&s;&s;e&s;s a heart alive in the keene&s;t degree to all the noble feelings of gratitude; and I am therefore mo&s;t eager to tell you (what &s;urely no one can tell you &s;o
<PB N="294" REF="298">
as my&s;elf) the rare, the &s;uperlative claims of your angelic mother to the gratitude, the tenderne&s;s, the idolatry of her children.&mdash; You will have heard undoubtedly that in the riche&s;t bloom of her youth and beauty, when the tender affections of her feeling bo&s;om had been awakened and quickened into the fonde&s;t attachment, &s;he had the re&s;olution to tear her|&s;elf from the idol of her heart, and, allow my vanity to &s;ay, from an idol that few women could have relinqui&s;hed. She had the per&s;ever|ing virtue to triumph over a pa&s;&s;ion that &s;he could hardly oppo&s;e, and live; and this &s;he ac|compli&s;hed, in &s;pite of every remon&s;trance, every entreaty, every &s;tratagem, employed by the man &s;he loved to make her renounce a re&s;o|lution which tortured his heart as inten&s;ely as it did her own. She was inflexible; &s;he was convinced that &s;he could not gratify her own ardent affection, without endangering the reli|ous principles of her children; &s;he perferred their di&s;tant &s;ecurity to all the immediate al|lurements of fervent and reciprocal love. What &s;truggles, what agonies, &s;he endured; what admirable faculties, and what exqui&s;ite virtue &s;he exerted in this conflict; you will per|fectly under&s;tand, by reading the papers that you will find with this l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter. They contain a long and very circum&s;tantial narrative of a tri|al perhaps the mo&s;t &s;evere that ever an impa&s;|&s;ioned woman &s;u&s;tained. Oh, my dear Willi|am! &s;he loved me with an affection as fond, as vehement, as &s;incere, as the female bo&s;om can feel; but the love of her children, refined and &s;trengthened by her ju&s;t attachment to God, was the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of her &s;oul.&mdash;
<PB N="295" REF="299">
What does a &s;on owe to &s;uch a mother? Your own generous heart will an&s;wer, undoubtedly, "a life of the fonde&s;t veneration, and the mo&s;t devoted obedience." Oh, my dear Willi|am! were it po&s;&s;ible for a precipitate pa&s;&s;ion to hurry you towards a marriage which would ren|der this incomparable parent unhappy; you mu&s;t be the mo&s;t unfeeling and mo&s;t ungrateful of beings to complete it. You could not do &s;o; or, if you co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld in the delirium of de|&s;ire, as &s;oon as that &s;ub&s;ided, you mu&s;t grow an object of abhorrence to your&s;elf, and of pity, if not of dete&s;tation to all the world.</P>
<P>But let me bani&s;h the&s;e painful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing images&mdash;let me chear my exhau&s;ted &s;pirits by a pro&s;pect which time, I flatter my&s;elf, will mo&s;t happily realize. It is my hope and my per&s;ua|&s;ion, that this letter will find you, my dear William, in dome&s;tic comfort, joy, and har|mony, with that angelic parent to whom you are &s;o deeply indebted; yes, as my life is ebb|ing fa&s;t away, I &s;eem to be ble&s;t with a clear prophetic vi&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;weet &s;cenes of family concord and delight which I mo&s;t fervently wi&s;h my deare&s;t friends to enjoy, and which Heaven, I am confident, re&s;erves as a reward for the mo&s;t meritorious of women. Your excellent mother, my dear William, will naturally wi&s;h you to marry early in life. Allow me the privi|lege of decorating your bride with jewels that belonged to a woman of beauty and of virtue. I had once vainly hoped to place them on the more lovely per&s;on of my adored Cornelia! Tho&s;e hopes are pa&s;t. Let me now plea&s;e my&s;elf with the idea that her hand may place them as a nup|tial
<PB N="296" REF="300">
ornament on &s;ome fortunate fair, as lovely, it po&s;&s;ible, in your eyes, my dear William, as the perfect Cornelia was in mine. But remem|ber, it is the reque&s;t of your dying friend, that the&s;e jewels may never decorate any bride of yours, however beautiful, if &s;he wants the noble ornament of my Cornelia's e&s;teem and affection. Ah! how vain is this charge! What mother can be &s;o tenderly di&s;po&s;ed towards a daughter, as our gentle Cornelia will be towards any love|ly girl that you can think worthy to be your wife? Her judgment and her tenderne&s;s can never be corrupted by any &s;ordid motives of ava|rice or ambition; and &s;he is, therefore, pecu|liarly entitled to be your prime coun&s;ellor in this mo&s;t important article of human life. O! my dear William, may you be happy in your choice! You can hardly be otherwi&s;e, if you have the &s;anction of that invaluable parent, who is at once a perfect judge and a con&s;ummate model of female loveline&s;s and perfection. Build your happine&s;s on hers; make her the architect and the partner of your felicity; be to her, I entreat you, the attentive, obedient, and grateful &s;on, which &s;he has &s;o &s;ingularly de&s;erved to find you; and may your virtues and your happine&s;s long and amply reward her for all &s;he has &s;uffered from the haple&s;s but not ungenerous love &s;till glowing in the heart which, while the &s;hadows of death are hovering over it, thus anxiou&s;ly folds you to it&s;elf in a paternal embrace, and begs you to remember with tenderne&s;s</P>

<P><PB N="297" REF="301">I will not attempt, my dear Edmund, to de|&s;cribe to you our various emotions while this let|ter was read. I will only &s;ay, that my dear feel|ing William &s;oon found his voice falter. Giuli|ana offered to relieve him. He declined her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and continued to read, but could not advance without frequent pau&s;es. At one pa&s;|&s;age, which you will ea&s;ily gue&s;s, he terrified me by &s;tarting up abruptly to quit the room; but he &s;aid in a tremulous tone as he went out, "I will return in a few minutes." The&s;e minutes were dreadfully long; a thou&s;and terrors, mixt with a gleam of the brighte&s;t hope, darted acro&s;s my mind in this affecting interval. He had the letter in his hand, and the paper annexed to it, which proved to be a full narrative of all that pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of my good old friend Mr. Danvers.</P>
<P>My &s;on did not return to us, as he afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, till he had peru&s;ed this paper; and the effects of it on his heart and mind were as full and forcible as our infinitely dear and provi|dent Seymour could have wi&s;hed them to be.</P>
<P>That animated &s;weetne&s;s and benignity which you have often admired in the countenance of my dear William, but which for &s;ome days had utterly di&s;appeared, was vi&s;ible again when he re-entered my chamber, where the little party remained in almo&s;t breathle&s;s expectation of his return. Seating him&s;elf by my &s;ide, he &s;eized my hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it as he began to read the following words, "But let us bani&s;h the&s;e pain|ful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing images," &amp;c.</P>
<P>He concluded the letter in a very audible, un|interrupted voice, but not without dropping tears on the clo&s;e of it. Then throwing him&s;elf into

Yes, mo&s;t perfect and mo&s;t beloved of mothers, it &s;hall be the chief pride of my life to be fully &s;en&s;ible of your perfection, and to comply with all your de&s;ires."</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Edmund! I could make no an&s;wer to my child but by folding him to my heart. My voice was utterly drowned, and the tears of the two Lucys were almo&s;t as abundant and overwhelming as mine. Our dear and more &s;pirited Giuliana did not weep; but her keen eyes fla&s;hed with a kind of fiery exultation and with that liveline&s;s of ge&s;ture which is pecu|liar to her&s;elf, &s;he caught William in her arms, and ki&s;&s;ed him; &s;aying, "Now indeed you are the true &s;on of our Cornelia; but come, you have done but half your duty; I mu&s;t, teach you the re&s;t." We all gazed upon her with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, and were utterly at a lo&s;s to conceive her meaning; but &s;he &s;oon explained her&s;elf by new and &s;ignificant ge&s;tures. Taking a very beautiful cro&s;s from the jewels that lay before us &s;he &s;lipt a little &s;ilk cord into the loop at the top of it, and having rapidly fa&s;tened it on the
<PB N="299" REF="303">
neck of your niece, &s;he exclaimed, "Here, William, is the only girl in the world to whom the&s;e jewels can properly belong. Lucy, hav|ing been trained, like your&s;elf, by your incom|parable mother, is the only per&s;on alive who can love you both as you both de&s;erve to be loved." I confe&s;s to you, my dear Edmund, that I was hath plea&s;ed and frightened by this rapturous and almo&s;t indi&s;creet &s;ally in our dear warm-hearted Giuliana. But &s;he has &s;ince truly &s;aid to me, that &s;he is no bad judge of the human heart; and &s;he felt it was a moment when a bold &s;troke in a young maiden's favour might be &s;afely taken. The dear mode&s;t Lucy was indeed di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the &s;peech, and was covered with tho&s;e eloquent blu&s;hes that &s;ay a great deal to an intelligent heart. My &s;on, with very ten|der gallantry, ki&s;&s;ed both the cro&s;s and the dam|&s;el, exclaiming, "If my &s;weet cou&s;in can real|ly love me as a hu&s;band, let her join me in vowing implicit obedience to this be&s;t of pa|rents." "Oh! replied the poor Lucy (with a mo&s;t maidenly embarra&s;&s;ment), that is a vow I have &s;ufficiently made already." "But you will not (cried William, with a kind of half-jea|lous quickne&s;s, that I own delighted me), you will not, my dear Lucy, refu&s;e to renew &s;uch a vow at my reque&s;t." "Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly not," &s;aid the &s;weet girl with more courage. And here I folded them both to my bo&s;om, and put an end to a conver&s;ation that I now thought it prudent to check, by entreating William to call his brother, that I might make him and all our gue&s;ts below immediate partakers of my fe|licity.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="304">Our fe&s;tival, though it began in the mo&s;t gloomy manner, has thus, my dear Edmund, proved a day of cordial delight, which wanted only your pre&s;ence to render it complete. In &s;ome mea&s;ure, however, I &s;eem to have had you pre&s;ent in your lovely daughter, who is univer|&s;ally admired, and particularly by one gentle|man to whom I confe&s;s my&s;elf partial: but Lou|i&s;a charges me not to &s;peak on this &s;ubject, as &s;he &s;ays it belongs to her; and &s;he threatens to come and talk to you in per&s;on. I have now been chatting to you a great part of the night. No great &s;acrifice, believe me; for I am much too much elevated in &s;pirits to go &s;oon to &s;leep, though my gue&s;ts, after the happy fe&s;|tivity of the evening, are gone peaceably to their pillows. I &s;hall di&s;patch this to you by an expre&s;s before the break of day, not only from my eagerne&s;s to compen&s;ate for all the pain I have given you, by admitting you as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible to your due &s;hare in my pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;s; but to receive, I hope, a mo&s;t favourable as well as &s;peedy account of your returning health.

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI. FROM LUCY AUDLEY TO HER BROTHER EDMUND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY VERY DEAR BROTHER</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE excellent account which you have been &s;o good as to give me of your&s;elf has &s;et my heart quite at re&s;t. I was very unea&s;y about you, in &s;pite of the gaiety here; but now I am all peace and exultation. The delicious &s;cene of dome&s;tic harmony and happine&s;s before me has made me quite young again; and as I have wi&s;ely re&s;olved not to fall in love any more for my&s;elf, I have actually fallen in love for your daughter. Seriou&s;ly, I am per&s;uaded that you will find the frank and plea&s;ant Mount Maurice a hu&s;band not unworthy of our dear Frances. They &s;eem to be in a very fair way of being &s;ufficiently plea&s;ed with each other. Now do not, with your u&s;ual quickne&s;s of parental anxi|ety, order a chai&s;e, and, gouty as you are, po&s;t away to Sedley-Hall. No, my dear Edmund, you may tru&s;t me, you know, for a Duenna, the only part that I am now fit to play. In &s;o|ber truth, you mu&s;t not come hither, though
<PB N="302" REF="306">
you &s;eem to hint at &s;uch a de&s;ign.&mdash;Why &s;o pray?&mdash;Well, do not be alarmed&mdash;the real rea|&s;on is, becau&s;e the whole party here have it in agitation to &s;urprize you with a vi&s;it; to a&s;k your ble&s;&s;ing, to be &s;ure, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Our enchanting young ho&s;t here declares, that he con&s;iders it as a point of duty, honour, and gratitude, to accept your friendly invitation; and that he is bound in per&s;on to re&s;tore your lovely daughter to the father who was &s;o kind as to indulge us all with her &s;weet &s;ociety at &s;uch a time. It was indeed very good in you; and we are all grateful. Heaven will reward you, if I prophecy aright, by providing here ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;on-in-law for you as I have often heard you wi&s;h to find. Tru&s;t me, Mount Maurice is per|fectly cured of his furious pa&s;&s;ion for Emily; and, as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erved to me, a little ta&s;te of true virtuous delight is &s;ufficient to wean an ho|ne&s;t heart from licentious allurements. He does however great ju&s;tice to many &s;ingular good qua|lities in poor Emily; and frankly confe&s;&s;es, that he once fooli&s;hly offered an immen&s;e &s;um to purcha&s;e her favours without &s;ucceeding.&mdash;Wil|liam has written to her; and &s;ent her a very elegant pre&s;ent, with which his mother &s;upplied him, being charmed, as &s;he told me, with the &s;pirit and delicacy of his letter. I was delight|ed as &s;he was, by his amiable ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, in giving her a &s;ight of this letter. He has ju&s;t received poor Emily's reply. Cornelia brought it to me this moment; and, as &s;he knows your &s;ecrecy, allows me to tran&s;cribe it.</P>

Ah, Sedley! this is a &s;evere, but a perfect te&s;t of my &s;inceri|ty. Our de&s;tinies call us different ways. You are ha&s;tening, I hope, to dome&s;tic harmony and delight; I, to magnificence and di&s;gu&s;t. Yet I cannot be completely wretched, if I hear you are happy; and I &s;hall feel a &s;park of hone&s;t pride in my bo&s;om, if your angelic parent (who is better known to me, perhaps, than you &s;uppo&s;e her to be) can add a little portion of her e&s;teem to that tender pity with which I am confident &s;he will often think on the ill-fated</P>

</LETTER>
<P>And now, my dear &s;u&s;picious Edmund, I know you will think Cornelia and me little bet|ter than a couple of watery-eyed &s;impletons, when I tell you we wept in concert over this little billet, and gave the writer full credit for the &s;incerity of her affection.</P>
<P>But we will talk no more of &s;uch per&s;onages. Thank Heaven, the period is now come, for which we have &s;o often and &s;o ardently prayed. I &s;ee the heart of our incomparable friend as full of delight as we have formerly &s;een it of affliction. I need not tell you, that I take a mo&s;t lively &s;hare (who does not?) in her tran&s;|port. After bitter apprehen&s;ions of finding my&s;elf a fal&s;e prophet, I exult at length in the veracity of my prediction; and with a delight|ful confidence I go on to prophe&s;y, that I &s;hall have the cordial &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing both our matchle&s;s Cornelia and my dear Edmund very thoroughly rewarded for every pa&s;t &s;uffering in the happy marriage and future permanent hap|pine&s;s of their children. The pro&s;pect for both is as fair as we can wi&s;h it to be; and I boldly foretell, that the event in each ca&s;e will be of the &s;ame charming complexion.</P>

<P>THE Editor has only to acquaint his bene|volent reader, who may wi&s;h to know whether the friendly Lucy was a true prophete&s;s or not, that her prediction in the la&s;t letter was verified completely.</P>
<P>Cornelia is at this time among the happie&s;t of human beings, and a &s;ingular example how a fond and tender &s;pirit, that has &s;truggled meri|toriou&s;ly through the tempe&s;ts of early pa&s;&s;ion, may enjoy a delicious &s;erenity in the evening of life. She is &s;urrounded by a numerous and beautiful groupe of her de&s;cendants, of whom &s;he is &s;till the idol and the director. While &s;he &s;hares in all their innocent and lively plea&s;ures, &s;he is particularly careful to animate and fortify the young mind with a &s;ea&s;onable and deep &s;en&s;e of Religion.
