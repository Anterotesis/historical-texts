<HEAD>A LETTER FROM Mr. Congreve, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>_SINCEREST Critick of my Pro&s;e, or Rhime,</L>
<L>Tell how thy plea&s;ing STOWE employs thy Time,</L>
<L>Say, COBHAM, what amu&s;es thy Retreat?</L>
<L>Or Stratagems of War, or Schemes of State?</L>
<L>Do&s;t thou recal to Mind with Joy, or Grief,</L>
<L>Great <HI>MALBRO</HI>'s Actions? That immortal Chief,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;lighte&s;t Trophy rais'd in each Campaign,</L>
<L>More than &s;uffic'd to &s;ignalize a Reign?</L>
<L>Does thy remembrance ri&s;ing warm thy Heart,</L>
<L>With Glory pa&s;t, where Thou thy &s;elf had&s;t Part,</L>
<L>Or do&s;t thou grieve indignant, now to &s;ee,</L>
<L>The fruitle&s;s End of all thy Victory?</L>
<L>To &s;ee th' Audacious Foe, &s;o late &s;ubdu'd,</L>
<L>Di&s;pute tho&s;e Terms for which &s;o long they &s;u'd,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">
As if BRITANNIA now were &s;unk &s;o low,</L>
<L>To beg that Peace &s;he wonted to be&s;tow,</L>
<L>Be far that Guilt! be never known that Shame!</L>
<L>That ENGLAND &s;hou'd retract her rightful Claim,</L>
<L>Or cea&s;ing to be dreaded and ador'd,</L>
<L>Stain with her Pen the Lu&s;tre of her Sword,</L>
<L>Or do&s;t thou give the Winds a far to blow.</L>
<L>Each vexing Thought, and heart-devouring Woe,</L>
<L>And fix thy Mind alone on rural Scenes,</L>
<L>To turn the level'd Lawns to liquid Plains,</L>
<L>To rai&s;e the creeping Rills from humble Beds,</L>
<L>And force the latent Springs to lift their Heads,</L>
<L>On watry Columns, Capitals to rear,</L>
<L>That mix their flowing Curls with upper Air.</L>
<L>Or do&s;t Thou, weary grown, the&s;e Works neglect,</L>
<L>No Temples Statues, Obbli&s;ques erect,</L>
<L>But catch the morning Breeze from fragrant Meads,</L>
<L>Or &s;hun the noontide Ray in whol&s;ome Shades,</L>
<L>Or &s;lowly walk along the mazy Wood,</L>
<L>To mediate on all that's wi&s;e and good,</L>
<L>For Nature bountiful in thee has join'd,</L>
<L>A Per&s;on plea&s;ing with a worthy Mind,</L>
<L>Not given the Form alone, but Means, and Art,</L>
<L>To draw the Eye, or to allure the Heart,</L>
<L>Poor were the Prai&s;e in Fortune to excel,</L>
<L>Yet want the Way to u&s;e that Fortune well.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">
While thus adorn'd, while thus with Virtue crown'd,</L>
<L>At Home in Peace, Abroad in Arms renown'd,</L>
<L>Graceful in Form, and winning in Addre&s;s</L>
<L>While well you think, what aptly you expre&s;s,</L>
<L>With Health, with Honour, with a fair E&s;tate,</L>
<L>A Table free, and eloquently neat.</L>
<L>What can be added more to mortal Bli&s;s?</L>
<L>What can he want who &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;t of this?</L>
<L>What can the fonde&s;t wi&s;hing Mother more</L>
<L>Of Heaven attentive for her Son implore?</L>
<L>And yet a Happine&s;s remains unknown,</L>
<L>Or to Philo&s;ophy reveal'd alone;</L>
<L>A Precept, which unpractis'd renders vain,</L>
<L>Thy flowing Hopes, and Plea&s;ure turns to Pain.</L>
<L>Shou'd Hope, and Fear thy Heart alternate tear,</L>
<L>Or Love, or Hate, or Rage, or anxious Care,</L>
<L>Whatever Pa&s;&s;ions may thy Mind infe&s;t,</L>
<L>(Where is that Mind which Pa&s;&s;ions ne'er mole&s;t?)</L>
<L>Amid&s;t the Pangs of &s;uch inte&s;tine Strife,</L>
<L>Still think the pre&s;ent Day, the la&s;t of Life;</L>
<L>Defer not till to Morrow to be wi&s;e,</L>
<L>To Morrow's Sun to thee may never ri&s;e.</L>
<L>Or &s;hou'd to Morrow chance to cheer thy Sight,</L>
<L>With her enliv'ning and unlookt-for Light,</L>
<L>How grateful will appear her dawning Rays!</L>
<L>As Favours unexpected doubly plea&s;e.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
Who thus can think and who &s;uch thoughts pur&s;ues,</L>
<L>Content may keep his Life, or calmly lo&s;e;</L>
<L>All Proofs of this Thou may'&s;t thy &s;elf receive,</L>
<L>When Lei&s;ure from Affairs will give thee Leave,</L>
<L>Come, &s;ee thy Friend, retir'd without Regret,</L>
<L>Forgetting Care, or &s;triving to forget;</L>
<L>In ea&s;y Contemplation &s;oothing Time</L>
<L>With Morals much, and now and then with Rhime,</L>
<L>Not &s;o robu&s;t in Body, as in Mind,</L>
<L>And always undejected, tho' declin'd;</L>
<L>Not wondering at the World's new wicked Ways,</L>
<L>Compar'd with tho&s;e of our Fore-fathers Days,</L>
<L>For Virtue now is neither more or le&s;s,</L>
<L>And Vice is only varied in the Dre&s;s;</L>
<L>Believe it, Men have ever been the &s;ame,</L>
<L>And all the Golden Age, is but a Dream.</L>
