<P>THE principal intention of this work is to give that &s;trength and fortitude to moral conduct, which are &s;o apt to decline in times of refinement and luxury; but which are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to individual and national happine&s;s. The author's claims to literary reputation are few: he has endeavoured, how|ever, both in the <HI>Dialogue</HI> and <HI>Narration,</HI> to write to the under&s;tanding as well as to the heart: or, to &s;elect from tho&s;e who had the &s;ame intention.

what he purpo&s;ed. There can be no doubt, but that young per&s;ons, more e&s;pe|cially, will find them&s;elves in&s;tructed as well as entertained: and on this account, chiefly, the author hopes to merit the approbation of all Tho&s;e, who, like him&s;elf, are anxiou&s;ly &s;olicitous concerning the conduct and welfare of the ri&s;ing generation.</P>

<P>YOU are certainly a very happy Man, Sir. Happy in your fortune, happy in your Friends, and particularly happy in your Family. Whence is it that your children have ac|quired &s;uch an evident &s;uperiority over the young people of their own age? I, you know, am but late|ly come to &s;ettle in this neighbourhood. Re&s;erve, the characteri&s;tic of an Engli&s;hman, I have in a ve|ry &s;trong degree, except when I conver&s;e with you; but in your &s;ociety, though I am con&s;cious you are my &s;uperior, I &s;eem to breathe and act with greater freedom. You bani&s;h my re&s;traint, you enliven my
<PB N="2" REF="9">
imagination: though almo&s;t a &s;tranger to you, I can a&s;k you que&s;tions with the confidence of in|timacy, and can be of a different opinion, without any apprehen&s;ion of offending you. With you I be|come unembarra&s;&s;ed, and acquire an ea&s;e and pro|priety that no where el&s;e &s;eem &s;o natural to me.&mdash; How does this happen?&mdash;Nay, your pre&s;ence &s;eems to influence every thing. The &s;cenery is particu|larly chearful and beautiful in this place; and the &s;pot you have cho&s;en for your&s;elf, is the paradi&s;e of delight. Such variety, &s;uch a charming a&s;&s;emblage of hill and dale, river, brook and clear &s;pring, wood and &s;hady grove, that I declare I fancy my|&s;elf in the regions of romance, and am inclined to be poetical when I vi&s;it you. In &s;hort, Sir, I admire you, and am afraid I &s;hould be tempted to envy any other man in &s;uch a &s;ituation. But I want to be informed of the rea&s;on of all this. Why &s;hould your arrangements be more happy, your &s;er|vants in better decorum, and your children more accompli&s;hed than others? explain the&s;e things to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without any affectation of mode&s;ty, Sir, I con|fe&s;s that I believe what you &s;ay, in part, to be true. &mdash;Your fancy is lively, and has heightened the co|louring, but, in general, I am of opinion that my family, my affairs, and my enjoyments of life, are different, and in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;uperior, to that of
<PB N="3" REF="10">
others. But this will not appear &s;o wonderful, when the habits and events that have concurred to make them &s;o are known; and the &s;horte&s;t manner of do|ing this, will be to relate the principal occurrences of my life&mdash;to give you, in a conci&s;e way, my hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Though I was the younge&s;t child of a nume|rous family, and con&s;equently was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but little wealth to begin the world with, yet I had one advantage to which I attribute all my &s;ub&s;equent &s;ucce&s;s; I had the in&s;truction, the experience, and the wi&s;dom of an affectionate father, to guide and direct me till I was fourteen. At this age, having lo&s;t my parents, though I had guardians, I be|came le&s;s circum&s;pect. Being of a warm and en|terprizing temper, and feeling my&s;elf &s;uperior to the generality of my young companions, &s;chemes of independence began to revolve in my mind. I ob&s;erved the &s;illy actions of men, and drew infer|ences favourable to my own prudence and capacity: tho&s;e to whom I was left in charge had weakne&s;&s;es; I &s;aw them and became impatient of controul. As I grew towards manhood, my mind became re&s;t|le&s;s, my imagination was heated by reading the &s;trong &s;entiments and great actions of the ancient heroes. The &s;ucce&s;sful career of young Scipio charmed and fired my fancy: I panted to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and neglected no opportunity that could render me remarkable; as the following incident will convince you.</P>
<P>I was educated at Eton School and ob&s;erving, one day, two of my &s;chool-fellows in&s;ulting a
<PB N="4" REF="11">
poor woman, that was tottering under age, it excited my indignation &s;o much, that I fell upon them both very heartily, and &s;truck one of them an unlucky blow. They conceiv|ing I had injured them, by interfering in a bu|&s;ine&s;s that did not concern me, and not being able to conceal their di&s;grace, complained to the ma&s;ter, and made up a &s;tory greatly to their own advantage. I was accordingly &s;ummoned to an&s;wer for my&s;elf. It happened that I had ju&s;t before been reading the tale of the Spartan Boy that expired while the fox was biting him. In con&s;equence of this, having at that in&s;tant a thorough contempt for pain, and indeed wi&s;hing for an opportunity to &s;hew how much I de&s;pi&s;ed it, I behaved &s;ullenly, and refu&s;ed to an&s;wer the ma&s;ter, except by haughtily declaring, I had done what I thought was right, and would, with the like provocation, do the &s;ame again. This, exclu&s;ive of the crime I &s;tood accu&s;ed of, was braving the authority of the ma&s;ter, who ordered me to be &s;everely puni&s;hed; which was what I wi&s;hed and expected. I &s;upported the pain as if I had been in&s;en&s;i|ble to it, and then told the ma&s;ter that he was mi&s;|taken, if he &s;uppo&s;ed me capable of fearing any puni&s;h|ment that he, or the wor&s;t of tyrants could inflict; I had done my duty by relieving age and imbecility from the wanton cruelty of two boys, and if he had done ju&s;tice he would have puni&s;hed them in&s;tead of me. The ma&s;ter, who was a &s;en&s;ible and di&s;|cerning
<PB N="5" REF="12">
man, replied "there is &s;omething peculiar in your conduct, young gentleman, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, but you do wrong in accu&s;ing me of ty|ranny. You have behaved with audacity, and if I &s;hould &s;uffer &s;uch ill manners to go unpuni&s;hed, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to pre&s;erve any order in this place. If, as you now &s;ay, you took the part of the oppre&s;&s;ed, you &s;hould have conde&s;cended to have &s;aid &s;o, when I que&s;tioned you at fir&s;t. I &s;peak thus to you, Sir, becau&s;e you &s;eem, from what I have ob&s;erved of your pre&s;ent and your former behaviour, to think &s;omething deeper, and &s;ee a little further than people of your age u&s;ually do, but you do not &s;ee far enough. I am no tyrant, young Sir; you have been very rude, and though I have &s;ome hope it proceeded from a good, though mi&s;taken mo|tive, yet, had I not re&s;ented it, I &s;hould have acted in|con&s;i&s;tently, and have degraded my &s;ituation. Re|collect your&s;elf, and if you have as much &s;en&s;e as I believe you to have, you will &s;ee your error."</P>
<P>This cool addre&s;s not only &s;hewed me how wrong I had been, in not explaining my&s;elf, but quite overcame me. I bur&s;t into tears, fell upon my knees, and, as &s;oon as I could &s;peak, a&s;ked his pardon for having u&s;ed &s;uch an injurious epithet to him. I then related the &s;tory of the old woman and my &s;chool-fellows, &s;imply as it happened, to|gether with my heroic imitation of the Spartan Boy. The ma&s;ter who was evidently &s;urprized and affect|ed by my manner and conduct in this affair, &s;aid to
<PB N="6" REF="13">
me, "Mr. Egerton, I am &s;orry I have degraded you by the puni&s;hment you have &s;uffered; you are an extraordinary young gentleman, and I have no doubt will one day become an ornament to &s;ociety. Let me, however, caution you again&s;t your pa&s;|&s;ions, they are very powerful, and while they per|&s;uade you that you are doing &s;omething uncom|monly great, or good, may lead you into very dan|gerous mi&s;takes. This fortitude and contempt of pain at your age, would have been beyond prai&s;e, had they been exerted upon a proper occa&s;ion; as it is, they can only be admired, but your generous protection of the helple&s;s de&s;erves every reward and encouragement, and I hope you will hereafter con|&s;ider me as your friend, and not your ma&s;ter. As for your accu&s;ers, there is no puni&s;hment I can in|flict &s;evere enough for cruelty, cowardice and lying; I &s;hall therefore expel them, left their example &s;hould corrupt others. I perceive you are going to intercede for them: but I will &s;pare you the pain of being refu&s;ed, by telling you, I cannot, in ju&s;tice to the other young gentlemen that are entru&s;ted to my care, &s;uffer boys of &s;uch vicious di&s;po&s;itions to a&s;&s;ociate with them. Youth is weak and incon&s;i|derate, and as liable to imitate a bad as a good action; it is my particular duty therefore not to permit the&s;e wicked boys to remain among them."</P>
<P>I have related this adventure, to &s;hew you the natural warmth and enthu&s;ia&s;tic bent of my temper.
<PB N="7" REF="14">
I went through a regular cour&s;e of education under the gentleman above-mentioned, who&s;e friend&s;hip I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed till his death, and to who&s;e advice and in|&s;truction I am greatly indebted. It was the intention of my guardians that I &s;hould &s;tudy the law, and be|come a coun&s;ellor; I however had other views; for though it is certain, no profe&s;&s;ion requires great|er acutene&s;s and abilities than this, yet as it is be|come common place to call it dry, tedious, knavi&s;h and &s;o forth, it was little alluring to a mind like mine, that had &s;o &s;trong a propen&s;ity to romance. I wanted to be a hero, or a poet, or rather a &s;ome|thing &s;upernatural, and it was experience only that could make me more rational. By my repeated interce&s;&s;ions and po&s;itivene&s;s in refu&s;ing to engage in any other vocation, my guardians were pre|vailed upon to buy me a commi&s;&s;ion in the army; and I entered it with an incoherent kind of hope of doing extraordinary things; but I had not been in it long before I di&s;covered that more of mecha|ni&s;m than courage was required: that I mu&s;t obey orders, and pay a &s;trict regard to trifles: that in order to ri&s;e to any very &s;uperior &s;tation, I mu&s;t not only have abilities, but powerful friends; and that without them it was as probable I &s;hould remain ob|&s;cure in this, as in any other profe&s;&s;ion. I was at the battle of Fontenoy, and, though I encouraged the men under my command, and executed the orders I received with the utmo&s;t ardor, yet I was convinced it was very little in the power of an individual to
<PB N="8" REF="15">
turn the fortune of the day, for notwith&s;tanding all my heroi&s;m, I was wounded and taken pri&s;oner. Some time after I was exchanged and &s;ent to Eng|land, when it was my fortune to fall deeply in love with my pre&s;ent wife.</P>
<P>Hitherto I had cared but little about riches, nay indeed as the poets and philo&s;ophers I had read u&s;ually affected to de&s;pi&s;e them, I did &s;o too, my amour however brought me to a &s;evere &s;en&s;e of the want of them. My mi&s;tre&s;s was the daughter of a very rich man, and an heire&s;s; I, a younger brother with a &s;mall fortune, rather dimi|ni&s;hed than increa&s;ed; and as the peace and half-pay had deprived me of any further hopes from the army, I had no apparent means of augmenting my wealth. This made me reflect on the ab&s;urdity of tho&s;e vi&s;ionary hopes in the contemplation of which I had formerly indulged my&s;elf. I began to perceive there was no arriving at perfection in any art, or knowledge, or eminence in any &s;tation, but by gradual and almo&s;t imperceptible degrees; my pa&s;&s;ion was violent, I &s;aw no probable means of obtaining a fortune in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, nor of gaining the woman I loved without one. The father of Mrs. Egerton &s;u&s;pected our love, which was mu|tual, and hinted, in an oblique manner, that he did not wi&s;h to &s;ee me any more at his hou&s;e. Af|ter turning every kind of &s;cheme in my mind, I con|cluded that the mo&s;t expeditious way of becoming wealthy, would be by going into the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t India Company; which, after con&s;ulting with
<PB N="9" REF="16">
Mrs. Egerton, and having exchanged reiterated promi&s;es of fidelity, I re&s;olved to do.</P>
<P>My family connections and the money I could command to begin with, gave the means of go|ing out in a re&s;pectable light: and I embark|ed, though with an aching heart, not without hopes of returning to enjoy the fruits of my in|du&s;try and love. I was abroad about three years, during which time I gained a con&s;iderable fund of worldly knowledge, and an in&s;ight in the ways, motives and manners of men. The facts were &s;ome of them not very much to their honour, but they taught me to think more con&s;i&s;tently. I do not mean by this to cen&s;ure the men of the world uni|ver&s;ally; there are many, within my own knowledge, of the &s;tricte&s;t probity, but the&s;e I have ob&s;erved never, unle&s;s by &s;ome accident, become &s;udden|ly rich. For my own part, I made but mode|rate advances, and this &s;low progre&s;s, with the letters I received from Mrs. Egerton, and the con|tinual anxiety of &s;o long an ab&s;ence, made me re|&s;olve to return. When I arrived in England, I found I had a legacy left me by a relation. This, added to my little &s;tock, made, in the whole, almo&s;t eleven thou&s;and pounds; for I had been as &s;trict an oeconomi&s;t, while in India, as the natural warmth of my temper would permit me to be: but there are weak, indolent and unfortunate men in all places, that mu&s;t ever be a tax on the more indu&s;tri|ous and &s;ucce&s;sful, who have &s;ome pity, &s;ome ge|nero&s;ity, and no exce&s;&s;ive degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, among
<PB N="10" REF="17">
which number I hope I &s;hall always remain: for though it is encumbent on every man to be prudent and a&s;&s;iduous, yet while I feel I have many weak|ne&s;&s;es my&s;elf, I tru&s;t I &s;hall always have philan|thropy enough to look with an eye of pity on tho&s;e of others, though I neither wi&s;h to en|courage theirs nor my own.</P>
<P>We are always apt enough to indulge hopes of &s;ucce&s;s when we wi&s;h it. I could not &s;ummon up the courage to wait on Mrs. Egerton's father and explain my&s;elf to him in per&s;on. I knew my fortune, tho' in this its improved &s;tate, was by no means equal to what he had a right to expect from the hu&s;band of his daughter. But as my family was re&s;pectable, and as I had u&s;ed &s;uch efforts to make my&s;elf more worthy, I &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible, when the&s;e things were enumerated, that they might have &s;ome influence on the mind of the old gentle|man: for which rea&s;on I re&s;olved to write to him, and tell him what I had done for his daughter's-&s;ake, and what I would do if he would but permit her to be mine. I did &s;o, and &s;oon received for an&s;wer the painful mortification of a po&s;itive refu&s;al, which threw me into a &s;tate of de&s;pair that had like to have proved fatal to me. An accident however ac|compli&s;hed that which all my former efforts had fail|ed to do. I received intelligence from Mrs. Egerton that her father was going into the country, un|der the pretence of taking her to enjoy the beauties of the &s;pring, but in reality to keep her from the
<PB N="11" REF="18">
&s;ight of me. I no &s;ooner heard this, but I re&s;olved to ride after them at a di&s;tance, to follow them down, and to di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf and live in the neigh|bourhood while they &s;hould remain there. It was fortunate for her father that I did &s;o. I communicat|ed my &s;cheme to Mrs. Egerton, and though &s;he di&s;|&s;uaded me from putting it in practice, it was in a way that &s;hewed &s;he but half di&s;approved my inten|tion. I therefore executed my plan, by taking the dre&s;s of an ordinary trade&s;man, hiring a lodging in the neighbourhood, and pretending I was ordered by the phy&s;icians to live &s;ome time in the country for a change of air, as being apprehen&s;ive of falling into a con&s;umption; and, as ill health always attends any extraordinary agitation of the mind, I had a temporary palene&s;s and dejection that made this pre|text very plau&s;ible. I had given Mrs. Egerton &s;o many proofs of the purity of my intentions, and the &s;trict honour by which I was actuated, that I had prevailed on her, while in town, to admit me to conver&s;e with her, in the pre&s;ence of her maid, in an evening, when her father was gone to re&s;t: and this, in con&s;equence of the pre&s;&s;ing earne&s;tne&s;s of my &s;olicitations, was repeated in the country. One evening, about midnight, when the whole hou&s;e except Mrs. Egerton and her maid was gone to bed, and every thing was &s;till and &s;ilent, as we were &s;itting indulging our melancholy, and renewing tho&s;e prote&s;tations of con&s;tancy which lovers never think can be often enough repeated, we heard a
<PB N="12" REF="19">
noi&s;e over our heads, in the chamber where her father &s;lept, as of per&s;ons walking without their &s;hoes. We were all alarmed, Mrs. Egerton particularly, who exclaimed "Good God! there is &s;omebody in my father's room, going to murder him perhaps." We li&s;tened, and pre&s;ently heard per&s;ons &s;peaking in a low voice, who were an&s;wered by the old gentle|man; this was almo&s;t immediately &s;ucceeded by a noi&s;e of &s;truggling, and the father's begging for God's &s;ake that they would &s;pare his life. I in&s;tantly &s;natched up the poker and the candle, flew up &s;tairs and bur&s;t open the door, where I beheld the old gentleman ga&s;ping for breath, beneath two villains who were endeavouring to &s;trangle him. My appearance was &s;o &s;udden, and the force of guilt &s;o &s;trong, that I made an ea&s;y conque&s;t. The hou&s;e was in&s;tantly alarmed by the cries of Mrs. Egerton and her maid, and the &s;ervants coming to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were bound and &s;e|cured. It appeared they were di&s;&s;olute fellows in the neighbourhood. They had crept into the hou&s;e, concealed them&s;elves under the bed, waited till they &s;uppo&s;ed every body gone to re&s;t, and then, after having obliged the old gentleman to deli|ver his keys, endeavoured to &s;trangle him, le&s;t he &s;hould wake his &s;ervants before they could accom|pli&s;h their purpo&s;e. The horror of the attempt made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind, that when he came to him&s;elf, and &s;aw his deliver|er, he wept, embraced me, cla&s;ped my hand, ble&s;|&s;ed me, called me his &s;on, his be&s;t &s;on, his pre|&s;erver,
<PB N="13" REF="20">
and &s;eemed delighted that he could, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be&s;tow a recompence for the &s;ervice I had done him by giving me his daughter.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine the temporary flow of happine&s;s that &s;ucceeded; it was all rapture, love, gratitude, thanks, acknowledgements and congra|tulations. But the&s;e violent delights cannot long exi&s;t; they have too often as Shake&s;peare expre&s;&s;es it, violent ends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romeo and Juliet.</NOTE>. This, however, happily, has not been my ca&s;e: they have &s;ub&s;ided into a calm and temperate tranquility. New &s;cenes opened upon me. I became a father, when the anxieties of a parent, with the experience I had had, &s;oon made me regard my former vi&s;ionary &s;chemes in a more &s;ober and rational light. It is true, they left a warm glow upon my mind, that has always kept it alive to certain &s;en&s;ations, which tho&s;e who have once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed never wi&s;h entirely to lo&s;e. It has enlarged my ideas, and given me a habit of extend|ing my views to objects, that with &s;ome people, are out of &s;ight. I encourage the effu&s;ions of fancy, I remember the agreeable dreams of my youth with plea&s;ure, and &s;ome of them I have realized.</P>
<P>One of my chief cares has been the education of my children. I can never forget the &s;trong impre&s;&s;i|on reading made upon me, when very young. This, I am convinced, may be turned to the greate&s;t ad|vantage, by tho&s;e who have the care of youth. Moral tales, well told, in which the good and ill effects of the pa&s;&s;ions are con&s;picuous, have a greater
<PB N="14" REF="21">
influence over the conduct of the youthful mind, and will do more in the improvement of the heart, than puni&s;hment or advice can ever effect. We are the creatures of imitation, and our mo&s;t prevalent pa&s;&s;ion is vanity. This is the rein by which the &s;kilful in&s;tructor &s;hould guide his pupil. Till a certain age, fear and correction &s;hould have their influence; after that, prai&s;e and example will be mo&s;t prevalent. This, at lea&s;t, is my opinion. For this rea&s;on, I have adopted the method I u&s;e at pre&s;ent. I have formed a reading &s;ociety among my own family. My children a&s;&s;emble every day in the library. Hi&s;tory and biography are the great re&s;ources, as the&s;e furni&s;h continual and real exam|ples of the effects of the pa&s;&s;ions; to the&s;e are added, &s;uch tales of fiction as I think well calculated to point out the good or ill con&s;equences of particular virtues and vices. It has been a con&s;tant &s;ource of delight to me, to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the mind, and the natural propen&s;ity of the human heart to rectitude and virtue. I have five children, three boys and two girls, the elde&s;t is nineteen, and the younge&s;t eight. They have all been educated at home, becau&s;e I have been afraid of their contract|ing the bad habits of their companions, had I &s;ent them to &s;chools. I am &s;en&s;ible this mode of educa|tion has its di&s;advantages, but as it has been the bu&s;ine&s;s and the delight of my&s;elf and Mrs. Egerton, to apply our&s;elves to this, and this only, and as we have been fortunate in finding men of genius to
<PB N="15" REF="22">
a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the ta&s;k, I am inclined to &s;uppo&s;e we have avoided many of the inconveniences, and &s;up|plied &s;ome of the defects.</P>
<P>There is one thing we have been particularly atten|tive to, which is candour. We have always &s;poken our &s;entiments with &s;implicity and &s;incerity. We have never di&s;gui&s;ed our meaning by endeavouring to de|ceive a child into virtue; for we believe all deceit to have a dangerous tendency. We have encouraged truth and openne&s;s, and taken every po&s;&s;ible precau|tion to detect, puni&s;h and expo&s;e the contrary. We have talked to our children rather as friends than ma&s;ters, and have become their confidants; for as we have never expected perfection, but have been always ready to forgive errors that have been inge|nuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed, prevarication and fal&s;hood, after a certain age, have &s;eldom been attempted by our pupils. It is in con&s;equence of &s;uch methods, that our little &s;ociety has acquired an air of freedom and &s;implicity, that cannot exi&s;t where artifice is not de&s;pi&s;ed. There is a natural aver&s;ion in the mind to confe&s;s its foibles. Vanity is continually in|tent upon drawing compari&s;ons in its own favour, and this principle is in&s;eparable from humanity. To correct it, to make the mind open to conviction, and willing to ob&s;erve and detect its real motives, is peculiarly the duty of teachers. E&s;timable as &s;cientific knowledge is, this knowledge is far more e&s;timable, becau&s;e upon this depends our happine&s;s, and the execution of all the &s;ocial duties.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23">Our family meet every evening, (except inter|rupted by being vi&s;ited, or going to vi&s;it) in the library; which is very commodiou&s;ly adapted for either a &s;ummer or a winter room.

<P>THOUGH there are many vices, the opera|tions and con&s;equences of which are general|ly more violent and de&s;tructive than that of &s;elf-love, yet there are none that render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or more mean and de&s;picable. The &s;elfi&s;h and covetous man is avoided by all who are not intere&s;ted in his affairs, and by them he is contemned. No rank or power can procure him re&s;pect. Bancroft, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, notwith&s;tanding his dignity, had the following &s;atirical epitaph be&s;towed upon him, for his covetou&s;ne&s;s:
<Q><L>Here lies his Grace, in cold clay clad,</L>
<L>"Who died for want of what he had.</L></Q>
Caligula was not more dete&s;ted for his cruelties, than de&s;pi&s;ed for his avarice; and when Cardinal Angelot received a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement from the
<PB N="19" REF="26">
hand of his groom, who, not knowing his ma&s;ter in the dark, detected him &s;tealing the oats from his own hor&s;es, his &s;uffering became the &s;ubject of laughter in&s;tead of pity.</P>
<P>But here, children, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that par&s;imony and oeconomy are two very di&s;tinct things. Every man mu&s;t have a certain degree of frugality, or he cannot continue benevolent. Lewis, the eleventh of France, was no mi&s;er, and yet in the chamber of accounts, 1461, there is two &s;hillings charged for fu&s;tian to new &s;leeve his maje&s;ty's old doublet.</P>
<P>Nor would I have you under&s;tand, that I wi&s;h to &s;ee any of you luxurious. When the Thracians &s;ent pre&s;ents of meal, gee&s;e, honey-cakes, &s;weet-meats, wines, and other dainties to Age&s;ilaus, the Lacedemonian, he only accepted of the meal; and when they pre&s;&s;ed him to receive the others likewi&s;e, he took them, but immediately di&s;tributed them among the &s;laves, &s;aying, that &s;uch delicacies were improper for men addicted to virtue, and that tho&s;e things which tended to enfeeble the mind or the body, ought never to be admitted among a free and liberal people.</P>
<P>The &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, my children, cannot be too intimately encouraged as long as they do not dege|nerate into prodigality. That univer&s;al benevo|lence, which inclines us to a&s;&s;i&s;t all tho&s;e whom we have the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, without materially in|juring our&s;elves, is perhaps the mo&s;t re&s;plendent
<PB N="20" REF="27">
of virtues. Selfi&s;hne&s;s hides it&s;elf in a corner, and, like a cur with his paw upon a bone, &s;narles at who|ever approaches: benevolence is frugal and &s;paring to her&s;elf, but opens her hand and her bo&s;om to hunger, wretchedne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Do you, Charles, read the following tale, it will better illu&s;trate my meaning than any thing which I can &s;ay.</P>

<HEAD>SELFISHNESS, Or the Story of CARAZAN the Merchant of BAGDAT.</HEAD>
<P>CARAZAN, the Merchant of Bagdat, was eminent throughout all the Ea&s;t for his avarice and his wealth: his origin was ob&s;cure as that of the &s;park which by the colli&s;ion of &s;teel and adamant is &s;truck out of darkne&s;s; the patient labour of per&s;evering diligence alone had made him rich. It was remembered, that when he was indigent he was thought to be generous; and he was &s;till ac|knowledged to be inflexibly ju&s;t. But whether in his dealings with men he di&s;covered a perfidy which tempted him to put his tru&s;t in gold, or whether in proportion as he accumulated wealth he di&s;co|vered his own importance by increa&s;e, Carazan prized it more as he u&s;ed it le&s;s. He gradu|ally lo&s;t the inclination to do good, as he acquired the power; and as the hand of time &s;cat|tered
<PB N="21" REF="28">
&s;now upon his head, the freezing influence extended to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>But though the door of Carazan was never open|ed by ho&s;pitality, nor his hand by compa&s;&s;ion, yet fear led him con&s;tantly to the mo&s;que at the &s;tated hours of prayer: he performed all the rights of de|votion with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous punctuality, and had thrice paid his vows at the temple of the pro|phet. That devotion, which ari&s;es from the love of God, and nece&s;&s;arily includes the love of man, confers new dignity upon goodne&s;s, and is the ob|ject not only of affection but reverence. On the contrary, the devotion of the &s;elfi&s;h, whether it be intended to avert the puni&s;hment which every one wi&s;hes to &s;ee inflicted, or to in&s;ure it by the compli|cation of hypocri&s;y with guilt, never fails to excite indignation and abhorrence. Carazan, therefore, locking his door, and, turning round with a look of circum&s;pective &s;u&s;picion, proceeded to the mo&s;que, and was followed by every eye with &s;ilent malig|nity. The poor &s;u&s;pended their &s;upplications as he pa&s;&s;ed. Though he was known by every man, yet no man &s;aluted him.</P>
<P>Such had long been the life of Carazan, and &s;uch was the character which he had acquired, when no|tice was given by proclamation, that he was re|moved to a magnificent building in the centre of the city; that his table &s;hould be &s;pread for the hungry, and that the &s;tranger &s;hould be welcome to his bed. The multitude &s;oon ru&s;hed like a tor|rent
<PB N="22" REF="29">
to his door, where they beheld him di&s;tribut|ing bread to the hungry, and apparel to the naked; his eye &s;oftening with compa&s;&s;ion, and his cheek glowing with delight. Every one gazed with a&s;to|ni&s;hment at the prodigy; and the murmur of innu|merable voices increa&s;ing like the &s;ound of ap|proaching thunder, Carazan beckoned with his hand. Attention &s;u&s;pended the tumult in a moment; and he thus gratified the curio&s;ity which procured him audience.</P>
<P>"To Him who touches the mountains and they &s;moke, the almighty and mo&s;t merciful, be ever|la&s;ting honour! he hath ordained &s;leep to be the mini&s;ter of in&s;truction, for his vi&s;ions have reprov|ed me in the night. As I was &s;itting alone in my haram, with my lamp burning before me, com|puting the product of my merchandize, and exult|ing in the encrea&s;e of my wealth, I fell into a deep &s;leep, and the hand of him who dwells in the third heaven was upon me. I beheld the angel of death coming forward like a whirlwind, and he &s;mote me before I could deprecate the blow. At the &s;ame moment I felt my&s;elf lifted from the ground and tran&s;ported with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity through the regions of the air. The earth was contracted to an atom between; and the &s;tars glowed round me with a lu&s;tre that ob&s;cured the &s;un. The gate of paradi&s;e was now in &s;ight; and I was intercepted by a &s;udden brightne&s;s which no human eye could behold. The irrevocable &s;entence was now to be
<PB N="23" REF="30">
pronounced; my day of probation was pa&s;t, and from the evil of my life nothing could be taken away, nor could any thing be added to the good. When I reflected that my lot for eternity was ca&s;t, which not all the powers of nature could rever&s;e, my confidence totally for&s;ook me; and while I &s;tood trembling and &s;ilent, covered with confu&s;ion and chilled with horror, I was thus addre&s;&s;ed by the ra|diance that flamed before me."</P>
<P>'Carazan, thy wor&s;hip has not been accepted, becau&s;e it was not prompted by the love of God; neither can thy righteou&s;ne&s;s be rewarded, becau&s;e it was not produced by the love of man: for thy own &s;ake only, ha&s;t thou rendered to every man his due; and thou ha&s;t approached the Almighty only for thy&s;elf. Thou ha&s;t not looked upwards with gratitude nor round thee with kindne&s;s. A|round thee thou ha&s;t indeed beheld vice and folly; but if vice and folly could ju&s;tify thy par&s;imony, would they not condemn the bounty of heaven? If not upon the fooli&s;h and the vicious, where &s;hall die &s;un diffu&s;e his light, or the clouds di&s;til their dew? Where &s;hall the lips of the &s;pring breathe fragrance, or the hand of autumn diffu&s;e plenty? Remember, Cazaran, that thou ha&s;t &s;hut compa&s;&s;ion from thy heart, and gra&s;ped thy trea&s;ures with an hand of iron: thou ha&s;t lived for thy&s;elf; and, therefore, henceforth for ever thou &s;halt &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone. From the light of heaven, and from the &s;ociety of all beings, &s;halt thou be driven; &s;olitude
<PB N="24" REF="31">
&s;hall protract the lingering of etrnity, and darkne&s;s aggravate the horrors of de&s;pair.'</P>
<P>"At this moment I was driven by &s;ome &s;ecret and irre&s;i&s;tible power, through the glowing &s;y&s;tem of creation, and pa&s;&s;ed innumerable worlds in an in&s;tant. As I approached the verge of nature, I perceived the &s;hadows of total and boundle&s;s va|cuity deepen before me, a dreadful region of eter|nal &s;ilence, &s;olitude, and darkne&s;s! unutterable hor|ror &s;eized me at the pro&s;pect, and this exclama|tion bur&s;t from me with all the vehemence of de|&s;ire. O! that I had been doomed for ever to the common receptacle of impenitence and guilt! there &s;ociety would have alleviated the torment of de&s;pair, and the rage of fire could not have excluded the comfort of light. Or, if I had been condemned to re&s;ide on a comet, that would return but once in a thou&s;and years to the regions of light and life; the hope of the&s;e periods, however di&s;tant, would chear me in the dreary interval of cold and dark|ne&s;s, and the vici&s;&s;itude would divide eternity into time. While this thought pa&s;&s;ed over my mind, I lo&s;t &s;ight of the remote&s;t &s;tar, and the la&s;t glim|mering of light was quenched into utter darkne&s;s. The agonies of de&s;pair encrea&s;ed every moment, as every moment augmented my di&s;tance from the la&s;t habitable world. I reflected with intolerable angui&s;h, that when ten thou&s;and thou&s;and years &s;hould carry me beyond the reach of all but that
<PB N="25" REF="32">
power who fills infinitude, I &s;hould &s;till look forward into an immen&s;e aby&s;s of darkne&s;s, through which I &s;hould &s;till drive without &s;uccour and without &s;o|ciety, farther and farther for ever and ever. I then &s;tretched out my hands towards the regions of exi&s;tence, with an emotion that awaked me. Thus have I been taught to e&s;timate &s;ociety, like every other ble&s;&s;ing, by its lo&s;s. My heart is warmed to liberality; and I am zealous to commu|nicate the happine&s;s which I feel, to tho&s;e from whom it is derived; for, the &s;ociety of one wretch, whom in the pride of pro&s;perity I would have &s;purned from my door, would, in the dreadful &s;o|litude to which I was condemned, have been more highly prized, than the gold of Afric, or the gems of Golconda."</P>
<P>At this reflection upon his dream, Carazan be|came &s;uddenly &s;ilent, and looked upwards in an ex|ta&s;y of gratitude and devotion. The multitude was &s;truck at once with the precept and the example; and the Caliph, to whom the event was related, that he might be liberal beyond the power of gold, com|manded it to be recorded for the benefit of po&s;|terity.</P>

<P>Barnard Gilpin was rector of Houghton le Spring, in the reigns of the Queens Mary and Elizabeth. At his fir&s;t undertaking the care of a pari&s;h, he laid
<PB N="27" REF="34">
it down as a maxim, to do all the good in his power, and to gain the affections of his pari&s;hioners. To &s;ucceed in this, he u&s;ed no &s;ervile compliances; but his behaviour was free without levity, obliging without meanne&s;s, and in&s;inuating without art. He conde&s;cended to the weak, bore with the pa&s;|&s;ionate, complied with the &s;crupulous, and in a truly apo&s;tolic manner became all things to all men.</P>
<P>To his humanity and courte&s;y, he added an un|wearied application to the in&s;truction of tho&s;e under his care; and with uncea&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity he employ|ed him&s;elf in admoni&s;hing the vicious and encou|raging the well-intentioned, &s;o that in a few years he made a greater change in his neigbourhood, than could have been imagined.</P>
<P>His ho&s;pitable manner of living, was the ad|miration of the whole country. He &s;pent in his family, every fortnight, forty bu&s;hels of corn, twenty bu&s;hels of malt, and a whole ox, be&s;ides a proportionate quantity of other provi&s;ions. Stran|gers and travellers found a chearful reception; all were welcome that came, and even their bea&s;ts had &s;uch care taken of them, that it was humourou&s;ly &s;aid, "If a hor&s;e was turned loo&s;e in any part of the county it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton."</P>
<P>Every Sunday, from Michaelmas till Ea&s;ter, was a &s;ort of public day with him. During this &s;ea&s;on he expected to &s;ee all his pari&s;hioners and their families. For their reception he had three tables well covered: the fir&s;t was for gentlemen, the &s;e|cond
<PB N="28" REF="35">
for hu&s;bandmen and farmers, and the third for day labourers. This piece of ho&s;pitality he ne|ver omitted, even when lo&s;&s;es, or a &s;carcity of provi&s;ion made its continuance rather difficult.

<P>Lord Burleigh, the Lord Trea&s;urer, being &s;ent by Queen Elizabeth to tran&s;act &s;ome affairs in Scot|land, when he came into Gilpin's neighbourhood, &s;truck with the univer&s;al prai&s;es which filled every mouth, he could not re&s;i&s;t his inclination to &s;ee a man &s;o truly re&s;pectable; and although his lord|&s;hip came on him unawares, yet he received his noble gue&s;t with &s;uch true politene&s;s, and treated him and his retinue in &s;o affluent and generous a manner, that the trea&s;urer would often afterwards &s;ay, he could hardly have expected more at Lam|beth. At his departure, embracing his generous ho&s;t, he told him he had heard great things in his commendation, but he had &s;een what far exceeded all he had heard: and when he had got to the top of a hill, which is about a mile from Houghton, he turned his hor&s;e to take one more view of the place, and broke out into this exclamation, "There is enjoyment of life indeed! who can blame that man for not accepting a bi&s;hoprick?

<P>THE account which my brother was &s;o oblig|ing as to give us, ye&s;terday, of the rector of Houghton, reminded me, at the time, of a &s;tory I had lately read; in which I very much admired the benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of a lady, who, though &s;he certainly had great rea&s;on to re&s;ent the conduct of her hu&s;band towards her, had the virtue and for|titude to forget her wrongs, and act in the mo&s;t ge|nerous and amiable manner.

<HEAD>BENEVOLENCE. Or the Story of PALAMON and AMASINA.</HEAD>
<P>PALAMON and AMASINA were married almo&s;t too young to know the duties of the &s;tate they entered into, yet both being extremely good-natured, a mutual de&s;ire of obliging each other appeared in all their words and actions; and, though this complai&s;ance was not owing to tho&s;e tender emotions which attract the heart with a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s
<PB N="32" REF="39">
force, and bear the name of love, yet were the effects &s;o much the &s;ame, as not to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t year of their marriage made them the happy parents of an heir to a plentiful e&s;tate.&mdash;All their friends congratulated this addition to their felicity; and the mo&s;t perfect joy and tranquillity reigned.</P>
<P>Ama&s;ina, after &s;he became a mother, began to feel, by degrees, an encrea&s;ing warmth of affection for him that made her &s;o; and having no rea&s;on to doubt an equal regard from him, thought her&s;elf as happy as a woman could be, and that there were joys in marriage greater than &s;he had formerly &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Quite otherwi&s;e was it with Palamon: the time was now arrived, which taught him what indeed it was to love.&mdash;The hopes, the fears, the anxie|ties, the impatiences, all the unnumbered cares, which are attributed to that pa&s;&s;ion, now took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart.&mdash;He pined, he langui&s;hed&mdash;but, alas! not for his wife.&mdash;He had, unhappily, &s;een a young lady at the opera, who had given his heart &s;en&s;ations and de&s;ires unfelt, unknown before. As he happened to fit in the &s;ame box with her, he had frequently an opportunity of &s;peaking to her: and, though only on ordinary &s;ubjects, every an|&s;wer &s;he made to what he &s;aid, &s;eemed, to him, to di&s;cover a profu&s;ion of wit and gave him the mo&s;t longing de&s;ire to be acquainted with her.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="40">Fortune, favourable to his wi&s;hes, pre&s;ented her to him the next day, in one of the public walks, accompanied by a lady and a gentleman, the latter of whom he had a &s;light knowledge of. He joined them; and perceiving it was to the other lady that the gentleman &s;eemed mo&s;t attached, he was at the greater liberty to &s;ay a thou&s;and tender and gallant things to her, who was now become the object of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Belinda, who was in all re&s;pects one of the mo|dern modi&s;h ladies, received the compliments he made her in a manner which convinced him his conver&s;ation was not di&s;agreeable to her; and, &s;ome mention happening to be made of a ma&s;querade that night, &s;he told him, that both &s;he and her fair companion intended to be there, and were then going to be&s;peak habits for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The hint was not lo&s;t upon Palamon: he fol|lowed them at a di&s;tance; and when the ladies had left the &s;hop he went in under pretence of hiring a domino for him&s;elf. Finding the woman be|hind the counter was no &s;tranger to the ladies, he ea&s;ily prevailed on her to let him know, not only what dre&s;&s;es they had be&s;poke, but al&s;o of what condition and character they were.&mdash;She informed him, that Belinda had a large fortune, and, her parents being dead, was under the care of guar|dians, though &s;he did not live with them, but had lodgings in an adjacent &s;treet.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41">Palamon was tran&s;ported at this intelligence, as it &s;eemed to promi&s;e him an ea&s;y acce&s;s to her ac|quaintance, and the privilege of vi&s;iting her; which, probably, in tho&s;e early days of his pa&s;&s;ion was all he aimed at. His impatience, however, occa&s;ioned him to go betimes to the ma&s;querade, that he might have an opportunity of examining every one that came in. He &s;oon di&s;covered Belinda, and was not long in convincing her, that he was the gentleman who made her &s;o many compliments in the morning. This greatly flattered her vanity. She li&s;tened attentively to the a&s;&s;urances he gave her of his pa&s;&s;ion, and frequently let fall &s;ome words, as if they e&s;caped her inadvertently, that might make him think &s;he would not be ungrateful, if he per&s;i&s;ted in giving te&s;timonies of a con&s;tant flame.</P>
<P>Palamon was tran&s;ported to find the offer of his heart &s;o well received; and made &s;o good a u&s;e of the opportunity &s;he gave him of entertaining her, that he obtained her permi&s;&s;ion to attend her home; and, as it was then too late for them to continue their conver&s;ation, to vi&s;it her the next day in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Belinda, it is probable, had no other motive for entertaining Palamon, and receiving his addre&s;&s;es, than merely that of hearing her&s;elf prai&s;ed, and giving pain, as &s;he imagined, to others of her ad|mirers who were le&s;s frequently admitted. But, how dangerous it is to encourage an intimacy with
<PB N="35" REF="42">
one of the other &s;ex, too many, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater &s;hare of di&s;cretion than Belinda, have expe|rienced.&mdash;This unwary lady in meditating new arts to captivate her lover, became in&s;nared her&s;elf. In &s;hort, Palamon &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Ama&s;ina, all this while, lo&s;t ground in his affec|tion; &s;he every day &s;eemed le&s;s fair, and whatever &s;he &s;aid, or did, had in it a kind of aukwardne&s;s which, before, he was far from di&s;covering; every thing was now di&s;plea&s;ing in her; if endearing, her fondne&s;s was childi&s;h and &s;illy; and if more re&s;erved, &s;he was &s;ullen and ill-natured. One mo|ment he was out of humour if &s;he &s;poke, and the next offended at her &s;ilence. He was continu|ally &s;eeking &s;ome pretence to find fault with the mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable conduct; and even vexed when he had nothing in reality to condemn.&mdash;Unhappy, but certain con&s;equences of a new attachment! which, not content with the injury it does, adds to it ill humour, and a wi&s;h for &s;ome occa&s;ion to hate the object we no longer love.</P>
<P>The poor lady could not help ob&s;erving this al|teration in his behaviour; but, as &s;he was far from gue&s;&s;ing the real motive, imputed it to &s;ome un|lucky turn in his affairs; though of what nature &s;he could not imagine, they having had a large fortune &s;ettled on them at their marriage, be&s;ides the re|ver&s;ion of what his father &s;hould die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>For more than a whole year did &s;he combat his ill-humour with &s;weetne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and the mo&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="43">
obliging behaviour: and, though &s;he began to think her&s;elf lo&s;t to his affection, bore even that afflicting thought with the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive patience; &s;till flattering her&s;elf, that, if it were even &s;o, he would one day reflect, that &s;he did not de&s;erve her ill fortune.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y was, however, a pa&s;&s;ion &s;he was wholly unacquainted with: many beautiful women vi&s;ited at her hou&s;e, and &s;he had never &s;een the lea&s;t pro|pen&s;ity in him to gallantry with any of them; &s;o that &s;he rather imagined a di&s;gu&s;t to the whole &s;ex was growing on him, than an attachment to any one in particular.</P>
<P>Thus did her innocence and un&s;u&s;pecting nature deceive her, till one day a female friend, more bu&s;y than wi&s;e, opened her eyes to the true rea&s;on of her hu&s;band's coldne&s;s. This lady, by means of a maid &s;ervant &s;he had lately entertained, who had lived with Belinda long enough to know the whole &s;ecret of her amour with Palamon, was made ac|quainted with all that pa&s;&s;ed between that guilty pair.&mdash;She learned from this unfaithful creature, that Belinda had been made a mother by Palamon; and that the child was di&s;po&s;ed of to a per&s;on who for a pre&s;ent of fifty guineas, had taken the &s;ole charge of it, &s;o that it &s;hould never appear to the di&s;grace of the unnatural parents. Not the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tance, relating to the affair, but was betrayed by this wretch, partly in revenge for her having been di&s;carded, and partly to gain the
<PB N="37" REF="44">
favour of her pre&s;ent lady, who, &s;he ea&s;ily perceived, loved to hear news of this kind.</P>
<P>Ama&s;ina would fain have treated this account as fabulous, and have per&s;uaded her friend to regard it only as a piece of malice in the reporter; but the other was po&s;itive in her a&s;&s;ertion, and told her, that it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a per&s;on to dre&s;s up a fiction with &s;o many particulars, and &s;uch a &s;hew of truth.&mdash;"Be&s;ides, added &s;he, if there were nothing in it, we might ea&s;ily di&s;prove all &s;he has &s;aid, by going to the woman who has the care of the child, and who&s;e name and place of abode &s;he has told me."</P>
<P>Compelled at la&s;t to believe, &s;he gave for a while a loo&s;e to her tears and complainings, but her good &s;en&s;e as well as good temper, &s;oon got the better of her pa&s;&s;ion; and, when her friend a&s;ked her, in what manner &s;he would proceed, in order to do her&s;elf ju&s;tice&mdash;What can I do? replied this charm|ing wife, but endeavour to render my&s;elf more oblig|ing, more plea&s;ant, and more engaging, if po&s;&s;ible, than my rival; and make Palamon &s;ee, he can find nothing in Belinda, that is wanting in me?</P>
<P>"O Heaven! cried the lady, can you forgive &s;uch an injury?"&mdash;"Yes, re&s;umed Ama&s;ina, &s;tifling her &s;ighs as much as &s;he was able, love is an invo|luntary pa&s;&s;ion."&mdash;"And will you not upbraid him with his ingratitude, and expo&s;e Belinda?" &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;"Neither the one nor the other, an&s;wered Ama&s;ina coldly; either of the&s;e methods would in|deed
<PB N="38" REF="45">
render me unworthy of a return of his affec|tion; and I conjure and be&s;eech you, added &s;he, by all the friend&s;hip I flatter my&s;elf you have for me, that you will not make the lea&s;t mention of this affair to any one in the world."</P>
<P>Ama&s;ina was no &s;ooner left alone, and at liberty to meditate more deeply on the &s;hocking intelligence &s;he had received, than &s;he again began to fancy there was a po&s;&s;ibility of its being fal&s;e: the &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, however, &s;eemed more dreadful to her than the confirmation could be, and &s;he re&s;olved to be fully convinced of the truth, if there were any means of being &s;o.</P>
<P>The unhappy wife of Palamon, who &s;oon became a&s;&s;ured of his per&s;idy, determined to bear it with as much patience as &s;he was able; which was indeed &s;ufficient to render her behaviour &s;uch, as made him po&s;itive in his own mind, that &s;he had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the wrong he did her; and al&s;o compelled him very often to accu&s;e him&s;elf for being guilty of what he could not an&s;wer to his rea&s;on, though he had not re&s;olution enough to abandon Belinda, notwith&s;tanding that the levity of her conduct di&s;covered the difference between a mi&s;tre&s;s and a wife.</P>
<P>Whenever Ama&s;ina reflected on this change in her hu&s;band, as &s;he had little el&s;e in her mind, there was no part in the adventure appeared more &s;trange to her, than that a lady, born and educated in the manner &s;he knew Belinda was, and who had
<PB N="39" REF="46">
&s;o far yielded to temptation as to throw off all mo|de&s;ty and honour, &s;hould have &s;o little regard for her innocent child, as to abandon it to mi&s;eries &s;he knew not of what kind. This was a barbarity, &s;he thought exceeded the crime to which it owed its birth, and &s;he more readily forgave the injury done to her&s;elf, than that to the helple&s;s infant.</P>
<P>The more &s;he reflected, the more &s;he was a&s;to|ni&s;hed, that a woman &s;hould act &s;o contrary to na|ture; and, by often picturing to her&s;elf the woes to which this de&s;erted child might probably be ex|po&s;ed, became at length &s;o generou&s;ly intere&s;ted in its fate, as to form a re&s;olution of which few, be|&s;ide her&s;elf, would have been capable.</P>
<P>She had been informed, by her officious friend, both of the name and habitation of the woman with whom this little creature had been left; when, without making any per&s;on privy to her de&s;ign, muffled her&s;elf up in her capuchin, and went in a hackney-chair to the hou&s;e. The woman received her with a great deal of re&s;pect and kindne&s;s, ima|gining &s;he was come on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s as Belinda.</P>
<P>The virtuous Ama&s;ina blu&s;hed at being &s;u&s;pected by this woman to be guilty of an act her &s;oul &s;hudder|ed at.&mdash;"I come not, &s;aid the wife of Palamon, on the bu&s;ine&s;s you &s;eem to think, though on one which equally requires your &s;ecrecy.&mdash;I have no unhappy infant to leave with you, but am come to ea&s;e you of one you have lately taken charge of.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="47">The woman looked much &s;urprized to hear her &s;peak in this manner, and knew not well what an|&s;wer to make; but Ama&s;ina put an end to her &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, by telling her, that &s;he was in the &s;ecret of the lady, who left a child at her hou&s;e at a certain time and who had given fifty guineas to be ea&s;ed for ever of the trouble of it.&mdash;"I am, &s;aid Ama&s;ina, a near relation of the gentleman to whom the poor infant owes its being, and cannot con&s;ent, that any thing which does &s;o, &s;hould be de&s;erted and expo&s;ed. I therefore de&s;ire, that if alive, you will let me &s;ee it. I will provide for it better than it can be po&s;|&s;ible that you &s;hould do for the pittance left by the mother."</P>
<P>The woman affected to expatiate on the impo&s;&s;i|bility of her taking the care &s;he could wi&s;h to do, with children left on the&s;e terms; but that hea|ven knew &s;he did all &s;he could, and often laid put more than &s;he received.&mdash;She a&s;&s;ured her, that the child &s;he enquired after was alive and a fine boy, but that he was with a per&s;on who indeed nur&s;ed for the pari&s;h, who yet was a very good woman, and did her duty.</P>
<P>That may be, replied Ama&s;ina, but I mu&s;t have him removed; and, if you can provide another nur&s;e who can be depended on, I have a power from the father to &s;atisfy you for your trouble, in a very ample manner. In the mean time, continued &s;he, putting five guineas into her hand, take this as an earne&s;t, and let the child be brought here to-morrow
<PB N="41" REF="48">
about this time, and a new nur&s;e, whom you can recommend.</P>
<P>The next day, this excellent pattern of conjugal love took with her every thing proper for a child, whom &s;he was determined to make her own by adoption. She no &s;ooner &s;aw the infant in his new nur&s;e's arms, than &s;he killed him with a tenderne&s;s little le&s;s than maternal; then, after having agreed upon terms, ordered him to be dre&s;&s;ed, in her pre|&s;ence, in the cloaths &s;he had brought; and, every thing being &s;ettled, returned home with a content|ment of mind which words are too poor to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor was this a &s;udden &s;tart of goodne&s;s and ge|nero&s;ity; for the more &s;he reflected on what &s;he had done, the greater was the plea&s;ure &s;he received. &mdash;She never let a week pa&s;s without going to &s;ee her charge; and had he been in reality her own, her diligence could not have been greater.</P>
<P>By accu&s;toming her&s;elf to perform the duties of a mother to the child of Belinda, &s;he began really to love him as &s;uch; and what, at fir&s;t, was only pity, converted by degrees into a tender affection. When Palamon was abroad, &s;he would often order him to be brought to her, and, &s;ending for her own &s;on at the &s;ame time, divert her&s;elf with their &s;miles and antics. She was one day employed in this manner, when Palamon unexpectedly returned, and came directly into the room where they were.&mdash; Whatever indifference he had for his wife, he had always &s;hewn the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s to her &s;on; and
<PB N="42" REF="49">
he now took him up in his arms and ki&s;&s;ed him, as was his cu&s;tom to do. "Here is another little one, &s;aid Ama&s;ina, &s;miling, who al&s;o claims &s;ome por|tion of your kindne&s;s;" and at the &s;ame time pre|&s;ented Belinda's child to him. "By what right, madam? replied Palamon in the &s;ame gay tone.&mdash; "As he is mine," re&s;umed his wife. "Yours!" cried he.&mdash;"Yes, an&s;wered &s;he, he is mine by adoption; and I mu&s;t have you look upon him as yours likewi&s;e." "My complai&s;ance for you may carry me great lengths, &s;aid he; but as I know you do nothing without being able to give a rea&s;on, I &s;hould be glad to learn the motive of &s;o extraordi|nary a reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"The infant you &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, in a more &s;eri|ous tone than before, and whom I have, in reality, taken under my care, owes its being to two per|&s;ons of condition; but, being illegitimate, the care of reputation prevailed over nature; and this inno|cent victim of an incon&s;iderate pa&s;&s;ion I found abandoned, either to peri&s;h, or, &s;urviving, to &s;ur|vive but to mi&s;eries wor&s;e than death.&mdash;The thought was &s;hocking to me, and I re&s;olved to &s;natch him from the threatening woes, and provide for him out of my private pur&s;e, in &s;uch a manner as not to make life hateful to him."</P>
<P>"An action truly charitable," &s;aid Palamon, a little perplexed; "but this is not the rea&s;on I expected, &s;ince by the &s;ame rule your pity might be extended to hundreds, whom, doubtle&s;s, you may
<PB N="43" REF="50">
find expo&s;ed in the like manner. It mu&s;t, there|fore, be &s;ome plea more forcible than mere com|pa&s;&s;ion that attaches you particularly to this child."</P>
<P>Ama&s;ina, who had fore&s;een what an&s;wer her hu&s;|band would make, was debating within her&s;elf, whether it would be be&s;t for her to evade, or to confe&s;s the truth of this affair; and, not being able to determine, appeared no le&s;s confu&s;ed and di&s;or|dered than &s;he would have been, if about to make an acknowledgement for &s;ome great offence.&mdash; At la&s;t, "a plea there is, indeed, &s;aid &s;he, but&mdash;;" here her voice and courage failed her, and &s;he was utterly incapable to give him the &s;atisfaction he required.</P>
<P>Palamon was confounded beyond mea&s;ure. Not knowing what to think of a behaviour &s;o new, and which &s;eemed to denote that &s;he laboured with a &s;ecret of &s;ome importance, he looked &s;tedfa&s;tly on her for &s;everal minutes; and perceiving that &s;he changed colour, and had her eyes fixed on the earth, grew quite impatient, and cried out, "What plea? what my&s;tery?"</P>
<P>"A my&s;tery, replied &s;he, which I had much rather you &s;hould gue&s;s at than oblige me to unra|vel.&mdash;Oh Palamon! continued &s;he, after a pau&s;e, is there no in&s;tinct in nature that can inform you, my affection for the father makes his offspring, of whom&s;oever born, dear to me?&mdash;I cannot hate Belinda &s;o much as I love Palamon; and, while I

<P>I have no doubt, but that both our daughters will endeavour to act, from motives as generous and &s;u|perior as were tho&s;e of Ama&s;ina. We have numer|ous examples upon record, of ladies, who have equal|led the greate&s;t actions of the greate&s;t men, who&s;e names are the ornament of hi&s;tory, the honour of their &s;ex, and the delight of &s;ociety. Who can read the account of the &s;iege of Wen&s;berg, in Germany, without feeling his heart expand to|wards the lovely fair? When the city could no longer re&s;i&s;t the arms of the emperor Con|rad, and when circum&s;tances made it probable that little quarter would be &s;hewn to the men, the women petitioned leave of the emperor to depart from the city and each to take with her what &s;he could carry. Imagine, my children, what was the &s;urprize of the emperor and his army, to &s;ee them come forth, not bending beneath a load of gold and
<PB N="48" REF="55">
&s;ilver, but each with her hu&s;band upon her back. The emperor and all his &s;oldiers, at lea&s;t all that had hearts, wept at the &s;ight; the women were adored, and the city was pardoned. Bodinus affirms, that Laurentius Medices was &s;o affected, only by read|ing this &s;tory, that he was re&s;tored to health, which he had long in vain expected from his phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>But &s;uperior in magnanimity, and equal in affec|tion, even to this, was the behaviour of Arria, the be|loved wife of Paetus. This unfortunate man had join|ed in rebellion with Camillus, again&s;t that weak and wicked emperor Claudius Cae&s;ar, and his attempts mi&s;carrying he was taken and &s;ent to Rome. The affectionate Arria, who re&s;olutely followed her hu&s;|band through all his fortunes, when &s;he was not permitted to attend him in the &s;ame &s;hip, hired a fi&s;herman's bark, and expo&s;ed her&s;elf to the dan|gers of &s;eas and the &s;everities of the weather, in this frail ve&s;&s;el, rather than for&s;ake her Paetus. When they arrived at Rome, he was condemned to die by his own hand, and permitted to chu&s;e what death he liked be&s;t. It was now that the fortitude, as well as affection of the lovely Arria were di&s;covered. Paetus was timid and dreaded death: Arria was afraid, le&s;t his timidity &s;hould prompt him to &s;omething unworthy of him&s;elf. She made him &s;en&s;ible that the eyes of pre&s;ent and future generations were upon him, &s;he de&s;cribed his duty, &s;he awakened his courage, and after em|bracing him, in a manner which love like her's
<PB N="49" REF="56">
could alone in&s;pire, &s;he took the poniard, and with a &s;mile of pity and of love, bidding him farewel, pierced her lovely bo&s;om&mdash;then, while &s;he had &s;till the power to &s;peak, exclaimed, "O my Paetus, <HI>this</HI> wound is a plea&s;ant one, it is <HI>that</HI> only which thou art going to give that is painful to me!"</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOUR father, my dear girls, very kindly took occa&s;ion ye&s;terday to make an eulo|gium on women, by introducing examples of &s;ome of our mo&s;t illu&s;trious ornaments. I am far from wi&s;hing to le&s;&s;en you in your own e&s;teem, I know that to have a proper idea of your own character and con&s;equence in &s;ociety, is one great induce|ment to act up to that idea. But this has its dan|gers; it may make us confident, proud and a&s;&s;um|ing: it may de&s;troy that di&s;tru&s;t which gives cau|tion, or may in&s;pire that arrogance which mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t. It is my duty to remind you that, as there have been women dignified by their virtues, &s;o have
<PB N="50" REF="57">
there been others abhorred for their vices. This is a painful recollection, my children, but a nece&s;&s;ary one. While our hearts are animated to connubial love, by the example of an Eleanor, who delighted to imbibe the poi&s;on that otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have kill|ed her hu&s;band, let us mournfully remember there were &s;uch women as Tullia and Me&s;&s;alina; le&s;t a too great portion of vanity &s;hould de&s;troy that emu|lation, which the example of the virtuous would otherwi&s;e incite.</P>
<P>The &s;tory which I &s;hall recommend to your at|tention, this afternoon, contains an unhappy in|&s;tance of the power of vanity. It is told by the &s;uffering per&s;on, and with a &s;ufficient degree of force to convince us &s;he had long felt it's effects and repented of her folly. I will read it to you my&s;elf, becau&s;e I would have you who are inter|tere&s;ted in it, be particularly attentive.</P>

<HEAD>COQUETRY, Or the Story of LADY WILDHAM.</HEAD>
<P>BEWARE OF COQUETRY, &s;aid the old lady of Wildham Hall, to her young niece; it is not only the mo&s;t ungenerous, but the mo&s;t dangerous folly, or rather vice, to which any woman can be addicted; it is de&s;tructive of its own purpo&s;es, and there is no &s;urer way to make any man hate,
<PB N="51" REF="58">
or at lea&s;t de&s;pi&s;e you, than fir&s;t to encourage his addre&s;&s;es, and afterwards treat them with neglect or contempt: it is an injury, which of all others, man finds the greate&s;t difficulty in forgiving; con|quer therefore your thir&s;t of prai&s;e, and while you are affable, take care not to &s;eem particular. It was the want of this prudence that has rendered above half my life, one continued round of di&s;|quietude, that has made me an acce&s;&s;ary in deeds of blood, and that gave to me, in&s;tead of the youth whom I had an affection for, one who was the &s;courge of my in&s;incerity and duplicity. I would de&s;ire you to relate your hi&s;tory (&s;aid the young lady) but that I fear, as you &s;ay it was unfortu|nate, the recollection may give you pain. Your de&s;ire &s;hall be gratified, (replied her aunt) in hopes that you may profit by my mi&s;conduct, and &s;ub&s;e|quent misfortunes.</P>
<P>You know, my dear, I was the only daughter of Sir Herbert Winworth, and I believe you have heard me &s;ay I received my education chiefly in the country, at Derby, the family &s;eat being in the vicinity of that town. It is nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that my per&s;on and accompli&s;hments made me the toa&s;t and admiration of all the country gentle|men, e&s;pecially the youthful and unmarried ones. I conver&s;ed in Italian and French with ea&s;e and volubility, had a fine voice, and took great delight in my harp&s;ichord. My under&s;tanding I believe was not contemptible, and I thought it prodigious.
<PB N="52" REF="59">
With all the&s;e advantages, my vanity was bound|le&s;s, my imagination romantic, and I was &s;ome|times almo&s;t fit to believe no man could be worthy of me, who had not killed a fiery dragon, and pulled the &s;ultan by the beard. You &s;mile, my dear, but though my ideas might not be exactly the&s;e, they were very extravagant: no flattery could be too violent for me, and however I might pre|tend to di&s;believe, or to be di&s;plea&s;ed at hyper|bolical prai&s;e and adulation, yet tho&s;e who had art enough to admini&s;ter &s;uch potions, had penetra|tion enough to perceive how delicious they were to my palate. Of all my admirers none had hither|to made &s;o great a progre&s;s as Glanmore. Others prai&s;ed my beauty, which was &s;o univer&s;ally &s;poken of that I never imagined it wanted any confirma|tion; but he told me my per&s;onal charms, like the glorious light of the meridian &s;un, were &s;een even by idiots, when they pre&s;umed to gaze, and which they could not do without feeling their immediate power; but as philo&s;ophy alone had di&s;covered the &s;alubrious and hidden effects of that ble&s;&s;ed lumi|nary, &s;o the charms of my wit, the elegance and propriety of my remarks, the keenne&s;s of my &s;atire, the &s;weet flow of my language, and the conviction that attended all my arguments and di&s;cour&s;es were beauties which he believed very few in|deed were capable of properly attending to, and which he, however great his admiration might be, confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an imperfect judge of. This gro&s;s
<PB N="53" REF="60">
flattery plea&s;ed me the more, becau&s;e young Glan|more was continually &s;poken of as the be&s;t &s;cholar, and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible youth in the country.</P>
<P>My father, who&s;e tenderne&s;s and love for me were equally vi&s;ible, and who, I believe, rated my accom|pli&s;hments as highly as any one, my&s;elf excepted, not|with&s;tanding his partiality, could not help ob&s;erving the violence of my ruling pa&s;&s;ion. He beheld with anxiety the plea&s;ure I took in the &s;ociety of the mo&s;t contemptible fops, and the freedoms I al|lowed them. He &s;aw with pain the chagrin my temper was liable to if any man took the liberty of behaving with ea&s;e, and paying a proper regard to any other woman. He could not &s;top his ears again&s;t the continual egoti&s;m of my di&s;cour&s;e; and if prai&s;e was pre&s;umed to be given to another ob|ject, he could not but ob&s;erve how ready I was to introduce my&s;elf, and make a compari&s;on either to my own advantage, or by tenaciou&s;ly di&s;prai&s;ing my abilities, when they had evidently the &s;uperiori|ty, to force others into a vindication of them, and violently to extort flattery. No one is ever &s;o &s;evere|ly &s;atirical upon per&s;ons of this character, as they are upon them&s;elves, their inordinate thir&s;t of adu|lation betrays them into a thou&s;and fooleries, and places them perpetually in numerous ridiculous &s;ituations, under which they &s;hrink, and blu&s;h, for a moment, and generally, in order to ex|tricate them&s;elves, commit &s;ome temporary blunder that heightens the ridicule. Be careful, therefore
<PB N="54" REF="61">
my dear, never to introduce your&s;elf into the di&s;|cour&s;e, either by compari&s;on, or in&s;inuation, and whenever you ob&s;erve &s;uch a propen&s;ity, check your|&s;elf very &s;everely, as knowing your&s;elf guilty of a mental weakne&s;s, very unworthy of that fortitude of mind, which it is the greate&s;t happine&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>My father's admonitions, though given with the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s, were exceedingly irk&s;ome to me; I was unwilling to believe I had any one foible, and that per&s;on who &s;poke di&s;re&s;pectfully of coquettes was &s;ure to incur my di&s;plea&s;ure; nay, when I &s;ometimes had the courage to rea&s;on with my&s;elf concerning it, I could never be thorough|ly per&s;uaded that I had one atom of the charac|ter in my compo&s;ition. The picture &s;till was perfect, and all tho&s;e tints which a &s;evere connoi&s;&s;eur might po&s;&s;ibly think too glaring, with me gently glided off into &s;hades of innocent gaiety, harmle&s;s raillery, generous emulation, and merited prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Glanmore, who not only from motives of love and intere&s;t, but likewi&s;e from pride, pur&s;ued the little advantages he had hitherto gained, became very a&s;&s;iduous in his endeavours to obtain me. There was a certain triumph, which would have gratified his vanity, even &s;uperior to every other con&s;ideration, which was that of winning the con|&s;ent of one who had rejected &s;o many, and whom &s;o many were daily wi&s;hing to po&s;&s;e&s;s. The tor|rent of adulation, which had been daily augmented from &s;o many pretty &s;treams, had rendered me in|&s;en&s;ible
<PB N="55" REF="62">
as yet of any &s;incere and tender attach|ment: my father from motives which you will ea&s;ily gue&s;s, was importunate with me to marry, and Glanmore teazed me exceedingly to give him permi&s;&s;ion to obtain my father's con&s;ent for our nuptials. I knew Sir Herbert wi&s;hed me to marry Lord Strangely, elde&s;t &s;on of the earl of Wild|ham, who had long paid his addre&s;&s;es to me, encouraged by the countenance my father gave him, although I had con&s;tantly ridiculed his pa&s;|&s;ion, and contemned his love. Unfortunate for me that I did &s;o: I have &s;ince &s;uffered &s;everely for my inju&s;tice. I call it inju&s;tice, becau&s;e I think it not only weak, but ungenerous to treat any one with &s;corn becau&s;e they love. Our humanity &s;hould in|&s;truct us not to add the &s;ting of contempt to the thorn of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Although I felt no violence of affection for Glanmore, yet there was &s;omething exceedingly plea&s;ing in his flattery and a&s;&s;iduity, and as his company was more agreeable to me than any other man's, I imagined that it mu&s;t proceed from love, at lea&s;t I endeavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf &s;o, for I was very unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf incapable of that pa&s;&s;ion, which at &s;ome intervals I almo&s;t began to &s;u&s;pect: partly therefore from an imaginary af|fection, and partly from a &s;uppo&s;ition that Sir Her|bert would not give his con&s;ent, and that con&s;e|quently my promi&s;e would be no bar to my incli|nations, if they &s;hould happen to vary, I gave
<PB N="56" REF="63">
Glanmore an a&s;&s;urance, if he could bring my fa|ther to approve of our union, my will &s;hould not prove an interruption to his happine&s;s. He left me when I delivered this decree in his favour, with the mo&s;t ardent prote&s;tations of his love, and rap|turous prai&s;es of my conde&s;cen&s;ion and goodne&s;s, and flew to find Sir Herbert, promi&s;ing to leave nothing unattempted, that might prevail on him to comply with his de&s;ires.</P>
<P>My lover's eloquence, contrary to my expecta|tion, &s;oon prevailed with my father. Glanmore told him that though it was true, his e&s;tate was not &s;o exten&s;ive, nor his rank in life &s;o elevated as that of &s;ome others, who &s;olicited the honour of becom|ing his &s;on-in-law, yet he hoped his endeavours, when united with Sir Herbert's intere&s;t, might enable him to de&s;erve and procure a title, which, thus attained, he repre&s;ented as being equally ho|nourable to being born to one. Sir Herbert's anxiety for me, joined to a de&s;ire of having me perfectly &s;atis|fied with the man whom I &s;hould take for a hu&s;band, together with Glanmore's abilities, made him eager for the con&s;ummation of the nuptials, and by the con&s;ent of all parties, they were accordingly ap|pointed to be celebrated in a month, as I could not, without appearing childi&s;h and irre&s;olute, obtain a longer period. I was now introduced to all Glanmore's friends, who paid him the highe&s;t compliments upon his choice, and I began to con&s;ider my&s;elf, not without frequent intervals of
<PB N="57" REF="64">
doubt and fear, in &s;ome degree, his wife; while the increa&s;ing tenderne&s;s of his manner plainly proved how happy the thoughts of this alliance had made Him.</P>
<P>One afternoon, when Glanmore came to pay me his u&s;ual vi&s;it, he brought a &s;tranger from London, a friend of his who had come down to &s;pend a fortnight with him, and introduced him to our fa|mily. Here, my dear Caroline, &s;aid he, when he pre&s;ented him to me, be plea&s;ed for my &s;ake to know Sir Harry Moreton, a di&s;tant relation of mine. He is an infidel to the Cyprian godde&s;s, con|tinued he, laughing, and his amorous creed runs thus: "I believe not in the power of Cupid, and I de&s;pi&s;e his darts, &amp;c." I turn him over in|to your hands, to puni&s;h him as you think proper, you will &s;oon make a convert of him. Nay, an&s;wered I, if tho&s;e are your friend's tenets I de&s;pair: unbelievers in the&s;e days are as re&s;olute in the defence of their here&s;ies, notwith&s;tanding the badne&s;s of their cau&s;e, as the faithful them|&s;elves, who have the light of revelation to guide them.</P>
<P>Madam, replied the &s;tranger, although I never was, nor perhaps ever &s;hall be &s;o romantic as my friend Glanmore pretends to be, yet I can admire wit and beauty, without &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly adoring them, though I a&s;&s;ure you I have &s;eldom met &s;o fine a &s;ubject for admiration as I behold at this in&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65">I curt&s;ied, and Glanmore exclaimed, "Your hum|ble &s;ervant, Mr. Admirer." When Glanmore and his friend were gone, I began to ruminate upon the behaviour of the latter: my pride was bleeding; I could not bear the reflection of Sir Harry's in&s;o|lent freedom, as I thought it. Neither could I help ob&s;erving, that his admiration turned chiefly upon him&s;elf, and that he was the hero of every topic of conver&s;ation, wherein he bore a part. I per|ceived the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch behaviour, and could not avoid applying it to my own conduct; I called him a coxcomb, and recollection of pa&s;t incidents, joined to my pre&s;ent wounded vanity, told me in a tone, &s;omething louder than a whi&s;|per, that I was little better than a coquette. I found an unea&s;ine&s;s attending the rememberance of him and his indifference, and began to &s;u&s;pect he was to revenge upon me &s;ome part of the cha|grin that I had inflicted upon others.</P>
<P>He came the next day with Glanmore, and not|with&s;tanding I took every opportunity of extorting compliments from him, and u&s;ed every art I was mi&s;tre&s;s of to heighten my charms, and awaken his attention, I found it impo&s;&s;ible to fix it even for a moment upon any object but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>By repeated attacks, I found the only battery which could po&s;&s;ibly be played, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, was flattery; I was weak enough to forget my former pride, and pre&s;ent engagements, and de&s;|perate enough to re&s;olve if po&s;&s;ible, let what would
<PB N="59" REF="66">
be the con&s;equence, to make Sir Harry acknow|ledge my power, and bow to my charms. I &s;ooth|ed my imagination with the thought of how I would u&s;e him when once I had him in proper &s;ub|jection.</P>
<P>It is in vain, my dear, to endeavour to de&s;cribe the meanne&s;&s;es to which pride made me &s;ubmit, nor can I tell you by what unaccountable means my mind became &s;o infatuated, and my affections en&s;laved &s;o entirely to an object, too, &s;o little wor|thy of them: yet, thus it was; and though it was impo&s;&s;ible to accu&s;e him of either beauty, wit, or one exalted qualification of body or mind, I was unhappy when out of his &s;ight, and the thoughts of my approaching nuptials filled me with the mo&s;t gloomy horror.</P>
<P>How can we account for the&s;e things? Why is it that we &s;igh and wi&s;h &s;o earne&s;tly for an object, not becau&s;e if is worthy of &s;uch affection, but becau&s;e we cannot obtain it? And why when by fortune or indu&s;try we have gained what we de&s;ire does it im|mediately become indifferent to us? My only rea&s;on for loving Sir Harry was, becau&s;e it &s;eemed almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for me to have him. I believe this is an error to which the human mind, however capa|cious, is ever in &s;ome degree &s;ubject, and though, as it is therefore indubitably a whole&s;ome law of nature, which prompts us to activity, yet we &s;hould be careful not to increa&s;e it in young or weak

minds, by continually gratifying their de&s;ires, and flattering their per&s;ons, or actions; unle&s;s with great caution, and to excite emulation.</P>
<P>However conceited Sir Harry might be of his ac|compli&s;hments, he was not &s;o blind to his intere&s;t as to be indifferent about his fortune; my weak behaviour, and his own confidence of per&s;onal merit, &s;uffici|ently per&s;uaded him of the practibility of rivaling his friend, and as this was a point which did not in the lea&s;t deter him, it was not long before he an&s;wer|ed my advances more warmly than I at fir&s;t had any rea&s;on to expect. From one indi&s;cretion I pro|ceeded to another, and my neglect, and even con|tempt, of the man to whom I had promi&s;ed to give my hand, were &s;o vi&s;ible, that they could not avoid alarming his jealou&s;y; though the approach|ing cri&s;is, mine and my father's con&s;ent, and above all the in&s;ignificance of his rival, contributed greatly, I &s;uppo&s;e, towards allaying tho&s;e fears. An accident however happened, which entirely confirm|ed Glanmore's &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>As I could not invent any plau&s;ible pretext for breaking off the match, and as I was re&s;olved, at any rate, to gratify my pre&s;ent inclinations, I had con&s;ented to a propo&s;al of an elopement made by Sir Harry, and which was to have been executed the very night preceding the day appointed for my marriage. The my&s;terious air which Glanmore ob&s;erved the &s;ervants of Sir Harry to affect, and &s;ome preparations they were making, for they had
<PB N="61" REF="68">
all received private orders, made him &s;u&s;pect there was &s;omething in agitation, which he had rea&s;on to dread, and which was nece&s;&s;ary for him to di&s;co|ver. By bribes, and promi&s;es, he prevailed on one of them, whom he ob&s;erved was more loquacious and &s;ignificant than the re&s;t, to repeat the orders he had received from Sir Harry; which were that Sir Harry's people were all to retire to their beds, &s;ooner than u&s;ual, where, in&s;tead of undre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves, they were to wait till within a quarter of one o'clock, and then if every thing was quiet in the hou&s;e, and Glanmore's family all in bed, they were to come down without their &s;hoes, and with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, take Sir Harry's po&s;t chariot round to the corner of Sir Herbert's garden wall, and wait for their ma&s;ter, holding them&s;elves in readine&s;s for a journey.</P>
<P>Glanmore's pa&s;&s;ions were &s;ufficiently alarmed by this intelligence: he had no room to doubt but that Sir Harry intended to carry me off by my own con&s;ent. Tormented and di&s;tracted with jea|lou&s;y, hope, and fear, he at one time re&s;olved to come immediately, and after upbraiding me with my infidelity, acquaint my father with it al&s;o; then changing his intentions, he put his pi&s;tols in his pockets to puni&s;h my lover for his perfidy. At la&s;t, however, he came to a re&s;olution to wait till night, and plant him&s;elf, and &s;ome friends whom he could rely on, in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be able to inter|cept us, if he found his fears confirmed, which
<PB N="62" REF="69">
he could not yet thoroughly per&s;uade him&s;elf were true.</P>
<P>Various and afflictive were the tumultuous feel|ings of the parties concerned in the tran&s;actions of this unhappy night. Glanmore's conduct proved the greatne&s;s of his torment: Sir Harry's, I be|lieve, was the mo&s;t placid: he had not &s;en&s;ibility enough to produce any violent agitation of either pain or plea&s;ure. As for me, the nearer the time approached, the more irre&s;olute and di&s;tracted was my mind: I never pa&s;&s;ed &s;o horrid an interval. Sometimes my imagination repre&s;ented to me the agony of Sir Herbert at my breach of faith and capricious conduct; at others, I beheld Glanmore upbraiding me, in all the pangs of de&s;pair, and hatred for my duplicity: nay &s;o intolerably was I oppre&s;|&s;ed with the incon&s;i&s;tency of my conduct, and the terror of my guilt, that I &s;tarted up three times with an intention to de&s;troy my&s;elf, but had not &s;ufficient re&s;olution. At length, the hour arrived, and Sir Harry entered, conducted by my maid, as had been pre-concerted: but &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion had my fears made on me, that I wept, entreat|ed, nay, at la&s;t ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go. My lover was not thus to be diverted from his intentions: he rea&s;oned, prayed, and at length &s;wore he would not be &s;o deceived, and catching hold of my arm, drag|ged me along with him; my fears of a di&s;covery prevented me from taking courage to re&s;i&s;t; whil&s;t
<PB N="63" REF="70">
his impetuous and violent conduct made me &s;hudder at my own.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I de&s;cribe the horror of the moment, when ju&s;t as Sir Harry was handing me into the chai&s;e, he was &s;eized and intercepted by Glanmore! &mdash;"Traitor!" exclaimed the injured lover, trem|bling with rage, and fury in his a&s;pect, "forego your worthle&s;s prize, and &s;atisfy my wrongs. As for you," &s;aid he to Me, darting a look of wild de|&s;pair and terror through my &s;oul, "though I &s;ee my folly in conte&s;ting a &s;ingle moment for &s;o fal&s;e, &s;o light, &s;o ungenerous a woman, yet, in your pre|&s;ence, will I puni&s;h this in&s;ignificant, this in&s;iduous coxcomb;" then giving his antagoni&s;t a pi&s;tol, and telling him it was charged, without quitting his hold, bade him prepare to fire! I &s;creamed! I flew to get between them ere the dreadful explo&s;ion! but in vain!&mdash;They both fired! they both fell!&mdash;</P>
<P>Good God! what tongue can tell, what pencil paint, what imagination can conceive, the wild, the tremendous de&s;pair of my countenance when, by the glimmering of the moon I beheld both my lovers weltering in their blood! I &s;eized one of the pi&s;tols, and with a violent blow laid my&s;elf &s;en&s;ele&s;s for a moment on the earth; then &s;tarting up, and giving a frantic &s;cream, I tore my hair, and face, while the &s;ervants and friends of the fal|len, &s;tood petrified with horror, unable to deter|mine whether what they beheld were real or no.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="71">The agitation my mind had undergone for &s;ome hours was &s;o increa&s;ed, by this &s;hocking tran&s;action, that I was carried home in violent hy&s;terics, which were &s;ucceeded by weakne&s;&s;es and faintings to &s;uch a degree, that it was thought at one time my life was in great danger. The youth and &s;trength of my con&s;titution, together with the almo&s;t miracu|lous news of the recovery of both the combatants, overcame my di&s;order; the ball of each had for|tunately taken place in the &s;houlder, and by that means e&s;caped a vital part.</P>
<P>Ever after this dreadful night the image of Sir Harry was accompanied with pain and di&s;gu&s;t, and Glanmore, in&s;tead of ever renewing his claim, was frequently heard to declare, that he deemed him&s;elf exceedingly happy in having e&s;caped an indi&s;&s;olu|ble connexion with a woman who was capable of &s;o much inju&s;tice and ingratitude: for indeed he had been a very warm and a&s;&s;iduous lover, and afterwards proved him&s;elf a tender and indulgent hu&s;band.</P>
<P>We have &s;ince regarded each other with a &s;igh, tho' I had far the greate&s;t rea&s;on, as my father, after this affair, peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon my giving my hand to Strangely, who was now become earl of Wild|ham, and had renewed his addre&s;&s;es to me, but who, after his fir&s;t tran&s;ports, has continually up|braided me with my &s;lights to him and crimes to others.

<P>And give me leave to ob&s;erve, my friend, vani|ty, which is the &s;ource of coquetry, and other follies in the ladies, is a mo&s;t baneful antidote to the pro&s;perity of Men likewi&s;e: it makes them commit the mo&s;t &s;illy actions, and fre|quently betrays them into irretrievable mi&s;takes. Rudolphus, a king of the Heruli, in a battle be|tween his army and that of Tado, king of the Lombards, was &s;o confident of &s;ucce&s;s, that he &s;taid fea&s;ting, in his tent, contenting him&s;elf with &s;ending a per&s;on to an eminence, to ob&s;erve the combat, and inform him when his troops &s;hould win the day, telling him at the &s;ame time, he would behead him if he brought bad news. The con&s;equence of this vanity was, his army was de|feated, and the me&s;&s;enger, afraid to return, left the fooli&s;h monarch to peri&s;h by the &s;word of the victors.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73">But the in&s;tances of men betrayed to de&s;truction by their own vanity are innumerable.

<P>OF all the articles of vulgar faith perhaps none has greater influence than that of dreaming.

Every body knows that theirs are waking dreams. I &s;hall take the liberty to relate one of the&s;e which I have lately had.</P>
<P>I thought I was &s;itting upon the cro&s;s which is placed upon the top of St. Paul's, amu&s;ing my&s;elf with contemplating the care, hurry, anxiety, and ambition, which were di&s;coverable in the counte|nances of the crowd that were bu&s;tling beneath me. As I was applauding my&s;elf for the &s;agacity of my conjectures, and the ingenuity of my remarks, I be|gan &s;uddenly to wonder by what &s;trange means I was carried thither, and whence I derived the power and re&s;olution to behave with &s;o much compo&s;ure
<PB N="68" REF="75">
in &s;o perilous a &s;ituation: when turning my head, I beheld, at my right hand, a Being with wings to his &s;houlders, of a beauteous and mo&s;t alluring countenance, and a radiant form. My &s;urprize was &s;o great that I found my&s;elf tumbling from the hor|rid precipice; but my pre&s;erver caught me by the arm, and by his &s;miles and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bani&s;hed my fears, and rein&s;tated me with &s;afety on my &s;eat.</P>
<P>"Mortal," &s;aid he, "I am one of that order of &s;pirits which, by men, are called Genii. My name is Hlalhlumhla, or, according to its &s;ignification in your language, the Vapour of Vanity. I am like|wi&s;e called by &s;ome Glparhja, that is, the Principle of Action, alluding to the part I take in prompt|ing men to hazardous and daring enterprizes. That you may have &s;ome knowledge of the power I po&s;&s;e&s;s, you &s;hall, in part, feel its effects." Im|mediately as he &s;aid this, he breathed in my face, and his breath was &s;weeter than the meadow air while the hay is upon the ground. He had no &s;ooner done &s;o, than I felt my&s;elf elated, after a &s;urprizing manner: I believed my&s;elf capable of performing any thing, and was going to leap from the height where I &s;at, confident of my ability, but was re&s;trained by my protector, who, while he held me, touched my lips with his finger, and I in&s;tantly became &s;en&s;ible of my danger, and wondered at my temerity.</P>
<P>"Mighty Being," &s;aid I, bending as I &s;poke, "I tremble at my pre&s;umption; expo&s;e not thy

<P>"Next to the great &s;pirit, I am the mo&s;t pow|erful.

I have breathed upon the ig|norant, and they have become philo&s;ophers, po|ets, painters, heroes, mathematicians. It is I who have in&s;pired men to build temples, and pull them down again. I accompanied Cae&s;ar into Gaul, and Alexander to the banks of the Ganges. I levelled the Alps to Hannibal, preached again&s;t the fear of pain or poverty to the Stoics, and &s;ent Cincinnatus, with &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, to the plough. I gave virtue to Ari&s;tides and Epaminondas, made Lycurgus a legi&s;lator, and taught Pyrrhus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is recorded of Pyrrhus, that he never prayed for encrea&s;e of wi&s;dom, wealth, or empire; he a&s;ked only health&mdash;Was this moderation or vanity?

<P>"Behold," &s;aid Hlalhlumhla, "yonder country gentleman, whom we will call Marius. He is walk|ing in his garden, &s;urrounded by his children, for whom he has a particular affection, as he has like|wi&s;e for their mother. He has riches enough to &s;a|tisfy his wi&s;h; he delights in the character which he de&s;erves&mdash;it is that of a good and worthy man.

Ob&s;erve the change he is going to experi|ence." The blue vapour i&s;&s;ued from the mouth of the genius, and ran like lightning, to fulfil its de|&s;tined cour&s;e. It finds Marius reading that anec|dote of Cae&s;ar, that tells us he fetched a deep &s;igh at beholding the &s;tatue of Alexander. He imme|diately becomes thoughtful; &s;erenity vani&s;hes from his countenance, his &s;teps are &s;hort and interrupt|ed; he reads the &s;tory again, and feels every thing that is related of Cae&s;ar. He entertains a va&s;t opi|nion of his abilities, and wonders at the former in|activity of his temper. A vacancy happens in par|liament
<PB N="71" REF="78">
for a &s;mall borough in his neighbourhood. The money flies among the electors, and he is returned. He hurries to town, &s;welled with am|bition, eager for fame, and reads and loads his me|mory with Gazettes, &s;peeches and prote&s;ts. Magna Charta, principles, patrioti&s;m, politics, ring an eter|nal change in his brain. He goes to the play, not for diver&s;ion, but to &s;tudy action and empha&s;is. He labours to be an orator. Hark how he thunders in the &s;enate; ob&s;erve how he is feared, even while he is laughed at. He intrigues with the minority, he tam|pers with the mini&s;try; he obtains a place, and he intrigues &s;till. His thir&s;t of preferment is in&s;ati|able, and he is as trouble&s;ome as unrea&s;onable. He threatens, &s;oothes, cringes, is the fir&s;t at le|vees, the la&s;t at cabals, flatters this lord's mi&s;tre&s;s, and bows to that peer's valet; &s;pla&s;hes through thick and thin, and delights to traver&s;e the dirty alleys of ambition. Health, virtue, content, all are &s;acrificed. His wife de&s;irous of his company and delighting in his love, follows him to town, but enjoys them not. A lord in great power &s;ees her and becomes enamoured; makes large promi&s;es, and the abandoned wretch, her hu&s;band, li&s;tens with avidity to the infamous propo&s;al, that flatters his am|bition.&mdash;Hear him commanding her to &s;ubmit!&mdash; behold her tears, her prayers, her ju&s;t re&s;entment of his wicked &s;chemes! he expo&s;tulates, he entreats, he threatens&mdash;and &s;ee! the knife is lifted up!"</P>

He wrote and publi&s;hed, and wrote again, and publi&s;hed again, and wondered at the world's &s;tupidity. In proportion to the decrea&s;e of his fi|nances was the increa&s;e of his malady. No province of poetry but has &s;uffered an inva&s;ion from his fury. He has at this time piled up under his bed, three epic poems, &s;even tragedies, thirteen farces, which he calls comedies, all with di&s;&s;ertations, e&s;&s;ays, apo|logues, prologues, epilogues, prefaces, adverti&s;e|ments to the reader and dedications, ready ma|nufactured; be&s;ides &s;atires, elegies, odes, pa&s;torals, &amp;c. &amp;c. without number. He &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent by collecting paragraphs for news-papers, and oc|ca&s;ionally filling up a vacancy in the Poet's Corner, which, "from his well heaped &s;tore," he is ena|bled to do at a moment's warning.&mdash;I perceive by your countenance you commi&s;erate his ca&s;e, and are de&s;irous I &s;hould undeceive him, that the poor man might &s;et up &s;chool-ma&s;ter, or find &s;ome other rational method of employing his abilities in what the world would pronounce to be his proper &s;phere: but this would be doing him a real in|jury. At pre&s;ent he is happy; he lives in continual hope that the period is at hand when he &s;hall bur&s;t like the &s;un from behind a cloud (to u&s;e one of his favourite &s;imilies) and a&s;toni&s;h the world with the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>OUR reading and conver&s;ation has been lately upon the effects of Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Bene|volence and Vanity. I think, therefore, we can|not better elucidate the&s;e &s;ubjects, than by taking a view of Temperance, which if rightly under&s;tood and practis'd, will undoubtedly promote the virtues, and wean us from the vices of which we have been &s;peaking. I have often told you, and I mu&s;t contine to remind you, my children, that al|mo&s;t all our wants are artificial. There is no wealth &s;o enormous as not to leave the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or poor, if he does not pre&s;cribe bounds to his ima|ginary nece&s;&s;ities. I &s;carcely need inform you, that the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e things, which among a certain de&s;cription of men are &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to exi&s;tence, are totally &s;uperfluous; in|vented by caprice, claimed by folly, and too often obtained by injus&s;tice. I cannot better point out how unnece&s;&s;ary the&s;e things are to real happine&s;s and true grandeur, than by de&s;cribing the temperance and &s;implicity which &s;ome of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exalted characters of antiquity maintained.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="89">Ari&s;tides, one of the greate&s;t men Athens ever produced, lived in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t rigid temper|ance, and paid &s;o little regard to wealth, that when he died he was obliged to be buried at the &s;tates charge; yet no per&s;on can &s;uppo&s;e, were hi&s;tory &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, that he who had &s;o often, and &s;o e&s;&s;entially contributed to the pro&s;perity of the commonwealth, wanted opportunities of enriching him&s;elf. This was a &s;till greater virtue in him, becau&s;e his origin was poor and mean, and there|fore he was the more likely to be tempted by wealth, which is too often &s;uppo&s;ed to include power, fame and all tho&s;e qualities at which men &s;o eagerly gra&s;p. His acknowledged ju&s;tice procured him to be elected trea&s;urer of the public money, and his inflexible adherence to oeconomy in this tru&s;t, occa|&s;ioned Themi&s;tocles to accu&s;e him of malver&s;ation, for which &s;uppo&s;ed crime the giddy multitude con|demned him in a &s;evere fine. For Themi&s;tocles, though a great man, wanted the virtues of Ari&s;tides, and was angry becau&s;e he was prevented from plun|dering the public. This &s;entence, however, was rever&s;ed by the wi&s;er part of the citizens, and Ari&s;tides was elected to the &s;ame office for the following year. Angry at the treatment he had re|ceived, and re&s;olved to &s;hew the Athenians their folly, he neglected to examine the accounts of tho&s;e Who had the expenditure of the public money, and pretended to di&s;approve of his former rigor. The&s;e people who had benefited by his connivance began
<PB N="81" REF="90">
then to extol him to the &s;kies, and intere&s;ted them|&s;elves that he might continue in his office; but on the day of election, ju&s;t as they were going unani|mou&s;ly to put him in nomination, Ari&s;tides ro&s;e, with indignation in his countenance, and addre&s;&s;ed them thus: "Oh Athenians, I am more a&s;hamed of the honour you intend me this day, than of the &s;entence you pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t me la&s;t year; and it is with concern and &s;orrow I &s;ee, that it is more meritorious with you to oblige ill men, than faith|fully to di&s;charge a tru&s;t. When I managed your trea&s;ure as became an hone&s;t man, I was treated like a villain; but now that I have left it to the di&s;cretion of the&s;e public robbers, I am proclaimed a mo&s;t excellent per&s;on and an amiable patriot."</P>
<P>Neither was the temperance of Ari&s;tides le&s;s con|&s;picuous as a judge, than in his former capacity. As he was &s;itting one day to decide a cau&s;e between two private per&s;ons, one of them endeavoured to influence him, by beginning to relate the many injuries his antagoni&s;t had in his life done Ari&s;tides, when he immediately interrupted him by &s;aying, "Tell me friend, what injuries he has done to You, for it is your cau&s;e, and not mine, that I &s;it here to determine upon."</P>
<P>I might quote numberle&s;s in&s;tances of a like na|ture, not only of Ari&s;tides, but of Phocion, Pelopi|das, Epaminondas, Fabricius, and many others, the examples of all of whom prove that temperance is the virtue of a truly great man, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

either when it tends to enervate the mind, or to bring the &s;lighte&s;t dependance, or di&s;grace upon the re|ceiver, &s;hould always be rejected with po&s;itive and unremitted firmne&s;s. Vulgar and narrow minded men are dazzled with the &s;plendor of riches, the wi&s;e de&s;pi&s;e them, except as they afford the means of doing good. When Timagoras returned to Athens, from his emba&s;&s;y to Artaxerxes king of Per&s;ia, one Epicrates, a porter, who had been in the menial train of Timagoras, and had enriched him|&s;elf by the king's pre&s;ents, propo&s;ed in an a&s;&s;embly of the people, that the Athenians in&s;tead of electing nine archons or governors, &s;hould chu&s;e twelve poor citizens and &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Per&s;ia, in order to be enriched by the gifts of Artaxerxes. The ab&s;urdity of this piece of low cunning was &s;o ex|ceedingly evident that it &s;et the whole a&s;&s;embly a laughing.</P>

<HEAD>INTEMPERANCE, Or the Journey of AZIBAH, in &s;earch of the Salutiferous Fountain.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the conclu&s;ion of the twelfth year of the reign of Hallam, monarch of Indo&s;tan, Ozmah, captain of the palace guards, came into the chamber of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the &s;on of Hedan, near the time of the
<PB N="83" REF="92">
&s;econd prayer, and &s;aid: "Azibah, &s;on of Hedan, I wi&s;h the command I am going to execute, may prove advantageous to thee. Give me thy &s;abre, and follow me to the &s;ultan; for &s;uch is his plea|&s;ure." The moment Azibah heard the&s;e words, he fell pro&s;trate, and, after imploring the protec|tion of the Prophet, &s;aid to Ozmah, put thy hand upon my head; the Sultan is ma&s;ter of my life, and I am his &s;lave! At the &s;ame time he delivered up his &s;abre and followed him. At the bottom of the &s;tairs, ten guards were po&s;ted, who environed Azibah, and conducted him into the pre&s;ence of Hallam.</P>
<P>The monarch had with him Serah, general of his forces, and Naran, chief of the Imans. Oz|mah pre&s;ented him Azibah's &s;word, and &s;aid: Light of the faithful, Azibah, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, hath &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to thy orders: may thine enemies imitate his example. Though Azibah, was not con&s;cious of having offended, yet his &s;pirits were &s;eized with terror: he, however, armed him|&s;elf, &s;o as to prevent any appearance of it, in his countenance. As &s;oon as the Sultan &s;aw Azibah at his feet, he &s;aid, "Son of Hedan, let us fall down before Him, who never dies." The&s;e words increa&s;ed the terror of Azibah. The Sultan, the General, the Iman, the Captain of the Guards, kneeled down, bowed their faces towards the ground, and glorified the Prophet. Azibah, uncertain of his fate, thus implored the protection
<PB N="84" REF="93">
of Mahomet: "If my re&s;olutions were &s;incere when I went to pay honour to thy &s;hrine, and to bedew with my tears the holy mount Arafat; if I have made it hitherto the chief delight of my mine eyes, to read over the divine book, be now my &s;upport. The computation of my days will &s;oon perhaps expire. I already &s;ee the dark and frightful angel ready to receive me. Remember the faith I re|po&s;e in thee. There is only one God, and thou art his Prophet."</P>
<P>Prayer being ended, the Sultan ro&s;e up; and, turning towards Azibah, &s;aid, "Son of Hedan, I have re&s;olved upon making thee undertake a long voyage; bow down thine head."&mdash;"Father of Mu&s;&s;elmen," an&s;wered Azibah, "the voyage will be certainly long, and without return, which we mu&s;t all expect to make at different times. May the mo&s;t mighty and merciful God multiply thy years." Having pronounced the&s;e words, he &s;tretched forth his neck to meet the fatal &s;troke. The Sultan drew the &s;abre, and extended his arm; but in&s;tead of &s;evering Azibah's head from his body, he re|turned the blade into its &s;heath. Such unexpect|ed clemency drew from the a&s;&s;i&s;tants loud accla|mations of joy. Azibah again opened his eyes, which darkne&s;s, the forerunner of death, had alrea|dy clo&s;ed: and Hallam, with a plea&s;ant a&s;pect, em|braced him. Having placed him between Naran and Serah, over-again&s;t his &s;opha, he made &s;igns for Serah to &s;peak to him.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="94">"My lord, &s;aid Serah, I have talked with a man, who was three hundred and forty years old, who had ten more to live. He was oppre&s;&s;ed with chains, in the King of Golconda's camp, after his defeat; and the victory you obtained, over that Prince, gave this per&s;on his liberty. I detained him three days, which hardly &s;ufficed to relate the revo|lutions he had &s;een, during the cour&s;e of his long life. I did not think proper to keep him any longer, &s;o I gave him ten roupees, with liberty to go where he plea&s;ed. He was a native of Bengal, and was called the old-man of that place. His eyes were much &s;unk, his voice was clear, his hair and beard nicely combed out, and as white as &s;now. Though his vi&s;age was full of wrinkles, it was en|livened with a florid red, and ea&s;ily might one di&s;|cover in it that gaiety which naturally accompa|nies perfect health. Being a&s;ked, what means he u&s;ed to attain &s;o very advanced an age; he told me his father, who lived till he was three hundred and fifty years old, had bequeathed three do&s;es of the water brought from the i&s;land of Borico, by virtue of which, he had been thrice re&s;tored to his former youth. I cautiou&s;ly de&s;ired him to tell me, in what part of the world this i&s;land was, and whether it was permitted to obtain any of the water of this fountain of life. He prote&s;ted, he could not an&s;wer either of the que&s;tions, and that he had &s;everal times propo&s;ed the &s;ame demands to his father, but never could be &s;a|tisfied in them. I then &s;trenuou&s;ly pre&s;&s;ed him to in|form
<PB N="86" REF="95">
me, by what means his father had found out &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a water: he always made an&s;wer, it was a pre&s;ent from VICHNOU, a god to whom he had for a long time &s;acrificed to. This, my Lord, was all I could gather from the old man. So fabulous a conclu&s;ion did not a little contribute to make me de&s;pi&s;e him; for, after what manner &s;oever I que&s;tioned him, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame &s;tory."</P>
<P>The Sultan, perceiving Serah had done &s;peaking, looked &s;tedfa&s;tly on Azibah, and &s;aid to him: "Son of Hedan, if the voyage I &s;eemed to threaten thee with, could not make thee afraid, why &s;houlde&s;t thou dread going to the i&s;land of Borico in my &s;ervice?" "Mo&s;t potent of Kings," an&s;wered Azibah, "I fear none on earth but thee. This in&s;tant, I will depart to &s;earch every corner of the world, and, if I fail to bring thee the water thou de&s;ire&s;t, then &s;ever my head from my body, and end the life of a creature, no longer worthy to live." The Sultan, having &s;trictly charged all pre&s;ent to conceal the &s;ecret, ordered Naran to provide every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the journey.</P>
<P>The next morning, as &s;oon as Aurora had with|drawn the curtains of the ea&s;t, and painted the mountain tops with glowing purple, Azibah left the city of Agra, and joined a caravan, going to Cam|baye. He had no equipage, and his dre&s;s but ordi|nary, though he carried about him, in gold and jewels, more than the value of a common city. He generally let the company pa&s;s on before him, that he might enjoy the greater liberty of reflecting on
<PB N="87" REF="96">
the method of executing his commi&s;&s;ion. He was extremely pen&s;ive, for he was per&s;uaded of the im|po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s, and, therefore, looked upon the expedition, as a bani&s;hment. "I am going, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, to wander I know not whither, in &s;earch of a fountain which has, perhaps, no exi&s;tence. And, even if it have, I am entirely ignorant of the coun|try in which it is &s;ituated; and am now, perhaps, travelling the direct oppo&s;ite way." The&s;e di&s;cou|raging thoughts, however, at la&s;t, began to give way to more plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, and he determined either to find the fountain, or convince him&s;elf that all &s;earch was in vain. He had not travelled three days, with the caravan, before he perceived he was not the only per&s;on who had avoided company to indulge reflection. A young man, well mounted, of a very agreeable a&s;pect, &s;eemed to be much in the &s;ame melancholy mood as he him&s;elf was.</P>
<P>To meet with companions in misfortune, alle|viates our grief. Azibah was greatly plea&s;ed to find an a&s;&s;ociate in affliction, and determined to make him acquainted with the nature of his jour|ney. Azibah approached him, and, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation on general &s;ubject, &s;aid to him, "Sir, I perceive that your &s;pirits are oppre&s;&s;ed by the hand of affliction: mine are al&s;o in the &s;ame condi|tion. Let us therefore mutually impart to each other the cau&s;es, from which our afflictions flow; perhaps each may derive advantage from the coun|&s;el of the other." To this, Sebah, (which was the
<PB N="88" REF="97">
name of the young man) readily con&s;enting, Azi|bah acquainted him with the commands he had re|ceived from the Sultan; intimating, at the &s;ame time, that he looked upon the fountain of Borico, as a mere chimera.</P>
<P>Sebah li&s;tened with attention to Azibah's rela|tion, and after a minute's &s;ilence, &s;aid, "Sir, I have accidentally acquired &s;ome knowledge of the &s;itua|tion of that famous fountain, which I &s;hall gladly impart to you. I am the &s;on of Rephan, a phy&s;i|cian, well known in Sciras. And I need not ac|quaint you, that all the youths of that city delight in dancing, or playing on &s;ome in&s;trument. One evening, when the heats of the &s;ea&s;on rendered the night more plea&s;ant than the day, I left my father's hou&s;e, to enjoy the refre&s;hing breeze, and played on a flagelet, as I pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets. In my re|turn home, I heard the window of a &s;pacious hou&s;e open, and, directing mine eyes towards the place, I &s;aw, by means of the light of the moon, which was then &s;hining in her greate&s;t &s;plendor, a mo&s;t beautiful lady, who &s;eemed to li&s;ten to my mu&s;ic very attentively. Plea&s;ed with the adventure, I &s;tood &s;till&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> continued playing, till &s;he withdrew; which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot till &s;ome con&s;iderable time after I fir&s;t &s;aw her. I took particular notice of the hou&s;e, determining to return the &s;ucceeding evening; but, ju&s;t as I reached home, an arrow pa&s;&s;ed whizzing by my ear; I &s;tarted, and looking back, perceived a man making towards me, armed with a bow in
<PB N="89" REF="98">
his left-hand, and a long javelin in his right. As he approached, he cried out, "Traitor! though I have mi&s;&s;ed thee once, I &s;hall be more fortunate a &s;econd time!" Seeing him alone, I took courage, drew my &s;abre, and, having happily parried his thru&s;t, gave him two wounds in the brea&s;t. He in&s;tantly dropped, and begged his life; telling me, he was &s;on to the Ba&s;haw of Sciras. I immedi|ately &s;ent a &s;urgeon to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, knowing I had every thing to fear from the fury of his father, I &s;tayed no longer in the city, than to provide my|&s;elf with a hor&s;e and money.</P>
<P>I followed the high-road, till nature, overwhelmed with fatigue, required repo&s;e, when I quitted it, and took a path between two mountains, the end of which terminated in a wood. Alighting, and tying my hor&s;e to the branch of a cedar, I laid my&s;elf down at the foot of a large palm-tree, and &s;lept till Aurora vi&s;ited the earth with her enlivening beams. On my waking, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear the voice of a man &s;peaking in the following manner:</P>
<P>"Now is the precious hour, child, that the genii appear under different forms to Princes who de|light in executing ju&s;tice, and to tyrants who de|&s;erve puni&s;hment. O child! coulde&s;t thou, as clearly as I, look into the events of this moment, then woulde&s;t thou behold &s;ome employed in the dark &s;hades of Mezanderan, to drive the lions and tygers from their dens, in defence of the innocent in op|pre&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="90" REF="99">
and admire the facility of others, in ren|dering the hydras and griffins tame and familiar."</P>
<P>I had no longer patience to li&s;ten to &s;o &s;trange a di&s;cour&s;e, without being curious to &s;ee the per&s;on that delivered it. Advancing &s;oftly, from one tree to another, I came to a pretty thick grove of lau|rels, where, concealing my&s;elf, I had the advantage of di&s;covering, without being perceived, a grave old man, dre&s;&s;ed in a long brown robe, and a young maid &s;itting near him, in a blue veil, which co|vered every part of her, except her face and hands. Her eyes were mode&s;tly fixed on the old man, whom &s;he &s;eemed li&s;tening to, with great attention. I &s;hewed my&s;elf, and by that means interrupted their conver&s;ation. At my appearance, the young maid drew her veil over her face, and the old man aro&s;e and met me. "You behold, &s;aid I, a traveller di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed by hunger and fatigue, compelled to crave your a&s;&s;i&s;tance." "By Ali! replied he, thou art mo&s;t heartily welcome; the &s;ages were never unho&s;|pitable. The charity I &s;hew you, will &s;erve as a new in&s;truction for my daughter. Go, refre&s;h your|&s;elf in our retreat, we will join you in an hour." He &s;hewed me, at the &s;ame time, a little path, which conducted me, after &s;everal turnings, into a grotto.</P>
<P>Though the entrance was very narrow and ob|&s;cure, yet it was &s;ufficiently light within, and con|tained &s;everal apartments. A &s;lave, to whom I declared my di&s;tre&s;s, and the charitable intention of his ma&s;ter, &s;et before me rai&s;ins, pi&s;tachoes, fre&s;h
<PB N="91" REF="100">
dates, white bread, and an excellent liquor from the palm-tree. Whil&s;t I was employed in &s;atisfying the cravings of nature, I de&s;ired him to go in &s;earch of my hor&s;e, de&s;cribing, as well as I could, the place where I left it. The &s;lave accordingly de|parted; and, after I had eaten and drank &s;ufficiently, my curio&s;ity prompted me to vi&s;it every corner of &s;o romantic a habitation. The mo&s;t remote ca|vity of the grotto formed a cabinet, filled with books, tali&s;mans, and figures of all kinds of plants and animals. Here I amu&s;ed my&s;elf for &s;ome time, and ca&s;ting my eyes towards the farther part of the cavity, I &s;aw, again&s;t the rock, the following in|&s;cription, in letters of gold: "Reader, whoever thou art, that ha&s;t been favoured to approach this &s;ecret rece&s;s of the &s;ages, ponder this, and be wi&s;e.

While I was attentively peru&s;ing this in&s;cription, the old man approached me, &s;aying, "Son, let the precepts of that writing be engraven, in living characters, on the table of thy memory." I thanked him for his kind advice, and de&s;ired him to explain what was meant by the waters of Borico. "My &s;on, &s;aid he, in the kingdom of Sofala, in Africa, is a large lake, in the mid&s;t of which are &s;everal i&s;lands, and particularly one much larger than the re&s;t, called
<PB N="92" REF="101">
Borico. In this i&s;land is a fountain, who&s;e nature is endued with the amazing property of re&s;toring youth to tho&s;e who drink of it. On the borders of this fountain grow many beautiful trees, which fill the air with a delightful fragrance, and are always loaded with the mo&s;t delicious fruits. But the pa&s;|&s;age to this fountain is guarded by leopards, &s;o that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to approach it."</P>
<P>The old man having fini&s;hed his explanation of this my&s;tery, after returning him my thanks for his kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality, I took my leave of him, mounted my hor&s;e, and, after wandering a long time through unknown parts, I had the good for|tune to join this caravan, and to find in it a compa|nion in misfortunes. Azibah li&s;tened with the ut|mo&s;t attention to Sebah's narrative, being agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o unexpected a di&s;covery, and deter|mined to direct his cour&s;e to Africa, in &s;earch of the fountain of Borico.</P>
<P>At their arrival at Cambaye, Sebah was informed, that the Ba&s;haw's &s;on was not only recovered from his wounds, but al&s;o become his friend. On hear|ing this agreeable news, Sebah &s;et out on his return to Sciras, and Azibah, having procured a &s;hip, &s;ailed for the coa&s;t of Africa. After a long and tedious &s;earch through uninhabited de&s;erts, he had the good fortune to di&s;cover the lake, in the mid&s;t of which the i&s;land Borico was &s;ituated. Being arrived at the &s;ide of the lake, he prevailed on &s;ome fi&s;hermen to carry him to the i&s;land. They did all in their
<PB N="93" REF="102">
power to di&s;&s;uade him from &s;uch a ra&s;h attempt, by a&s;&s;uring him that it was only inhabited by wild bea&s;ts, from which it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape. The&s;e rea&s;ons were lo&s;t on Azibah, he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution; and the fi&s;hermen, find|ing it in vain to oppo&s;e him, landed him on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Here he wandered, &s;eeking in vain the &s;alutife|rous fountain. De&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;et him|&s;elf down in a valley, and fell a&s;leep. When he awaked, he beheld a beautiful lady dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of the country, approaching him; who, with a great deal of &s;weetne&s;s, a&s;ked him what he &s;ought. He acquainted her with the commands of the Sul|tan, and the rea&s;ons which induced him to come thither in &s;earch of the fountain. "Since you con|&s;ult me, an&s;wered &s;he, it will be your own fault, if you do not &s;ucceed. As you go out of this val|ley, you will find a cry&s;tal &s;tream flowing from a beautiful fountain, and di&s;charging it&s;elf into a large river, not far di&s;tant from its &s;ource. At the bottom of the fountain you will find a little blue pebble, which you mu&s;t not fail to take up; then follow the &s;tream, till you arrive at the river, and direct your cour&s;e along the bank of it, till it divides it&s;elf into two branches, and forms an i&s;land, or rather garden, in the middle of which is the &s;alutiferous fountain. Over an arm of the ri|ver, there is a marble bridge; its pa&s;&s;age is defended by twenty-&s;even leopards. Before you come in
<PB N="94" REF="103">
&s;ight of them, put the little blue pebble in your mouth, and pa&s;s boldly over the bridge, for the pebble will render you invi&s;ible. When you approach the foun|tain, take up what water you intend, and return immediately. But be careful not to eat of the fruits of luxuriant trees growing on the margin of the fountain." The lady, after uttering the&s;e words, difappeared; and Azibah took the path &s;he directed.</P>
<P>The fountain, the pebble, the river, the bridge, and the leopards pre&s;ented them&s;elves &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to his view. As he entered the garden, he was &s;a|luted with an odour inexpre&s;&s;ibly ravi&s;hing, pro|ceeding from the flowers and fruits, which it pro|duced in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion. Near the margin of the &s;alutiferous fountain was a tree eminently taller than the re&s;t, loaded with fruit of &s;o enchant|ing an a&s;pect, that even imagination it&s;elf can hardly paint any thing &s;o beautiful. Azibah, un|able to with&s;tand the temptation, took the pebble but of his mouth, plucked off the fruit, and began to eat. The ta&s;te was delicious and enchanting; but, alas! the plea&s;ure was but of &s;hort duration. The leopards now ca&s;t their furious eyes upon him, made towards him with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, and were ju&s;t on the point of tearing him to pieces, when the lady, who had before directed him, &s;ud|denly appeared. At her pre&s;ence, the&s;e fierce crea|tures returned to their &s;tation, and Azibah pro&s;|trated him&s;elf at her feet, endeavouring to expre&s;s his repentance and gratitude. "You are now,
<PB N="95" REF="104">
&s;aid &s;he, lo&s;t to all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; acknowledge your fault, and &s;pend the remainder of your life in &s;olitude." Having &s;aid this, &s;he took him by the hand, and, after conducting him beyond the bridge, charged him to return the &s;ame way that he came, and to put the pebble in its place, as he pa&s;&s;ed by the fountain; which he had no &s;ooner done, than the whole vani&s;hed from his &s;ight; neither bridge, river, nor fountain were any longer vi&s;ible; and, to add to his a&s;toni&s;hment, he found him&s;elf on the top of the mountain of Arafat.</P>
<P>Thus was the unfortunate Azibah, through his own folly, di&s;appointed, when he thought the object, he had pur&s;ued through &s;o many difficulties, within his reach. And hence we &s;hould learn to govern our pa&s;&s;ions and appetites; for, if we &s;uffer them to prevail, all our re&s;olution, a&s;&s;iduity, and per&s;everance, in any undertaking, will be rendered abortive. Health, honour, and reputation will be &s;acrificed to the gratification of &s;ome mean and unworthy pa&s;|&s;ion; and, like Azibah, for the momentary plea&s;ure of ta&s;ting one delicious mor&s;el, lo&s;e the &s;alutiferous waters of Borico.</P>

<HEAD>WEALTH and its CONSEQUENCES.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS the &s;econd &s;on of a wealthy gentleman, who re&s;erved the bulk of his fortune for my elder brother, &s;o that my only provi&s;ion was a tolerable education, and a commi&s;&s;ion in the army: but being &s;oon weary of a &s;oldier's life, I &s;old out at the com|mencement of the pre&s;ent American war, and though my fortune ari&s;ing from that &s;ale was but incon&s;ider|able, I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the idea of independence, and determined to enjoy it, by living within my income. Take away &s;uch a determination, and there can be no true independence in the mo&s;t affluent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>My father had by this time re&s;igned his breath; I had no parental home to which I could retire, and therefore &s;et up my re&s;t in a country town, where I had been formerly quartered with my regiment, and had made &s;ome agreeable acquaintances. There I pa&s;&s;|ed my time according to my heart's de&s;ire.&mdash;I fi&s;hed, fowled, and hunted with the gentlemen of the neigh|bourhood, who entertained me in their hou&s;es with
<PB N="97" REF="106">
the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality. I walked, I chatted, I danced, and played at cards with their wives and daughters. Delightful excur&s;ions and amu&s;ing par|ties of plea&s;ure were planned and executed every day. The time &s;tole away in&s;en&s;ibly: I knew no care; I felt no di&s;order; I inherited from nature a vigorous con&s;titution, a happy &s;erenity of temper, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed among my friends as the be&s;t humoured fellow in the world.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e enjoyments, my heart was touched by the amiable qualities of a young lady, who was content to unite her fate with mine, con|trary to the inclination, and without the con&s;ent of her father, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very large fortune. He re&s;ented her marriage with &s;uch per&s;everance of in|dignation, as never to admit her into his pre&s;ence; nor even at his death forgave her for the &s;tep &s;he had taken. His di&s;plea&s;ure, however, affected us the le&s;s, as we found happine&s;s in our mutual pa&s;&s;ion, and knew no wants, for my wife inherited from an aunt a legacy of eighteen hundred pounds, the in|tere&s;t of which, together with my little income, was &s;ufficient to an&s;wer our de&s;ires.</P>
<P>We found great &s;atisfaction in contriving plans for living &s;nug upon our income, and enjoyed un|&s;peakable plea&s;ure in executing the &s;cheme to which we had given the preference. Chance pre&s;ented us with an opportunity to purcha&s;e a &s;mall, though neat and convenient hou&s;e, with about twenty acres of land, in an agreeable rural &s;ituation, and there our
<PB N="98" REF="107">
time was parcelled out in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ta&s;ks, for improving a large farm that we rented, and culti|vating a &s;weet little garden, laid out on a gentle &s;lope, the foot of which was watered by a branching rivulet of pure, tran&s;parent water. Although heaven had not thought proper to indulge us with children, we were favoured with every other &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;|&s;ing, and every other circum&s;tance of rural oeco|nomy proved a &s;ource of wealth and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The labours of the field, the little dome&s;tic cares of the barn-yard, the poultry, and the dairy, were productive of &s;uch delights as none of your readers, except tho&s;e who are enamoured of a country life, will conceive. I cannot remember tho&s;e peaceful &s;cenes of innocence and tranquillity without regret; they often haunt my imagination, like the gho&s;t of de|parted happine&s;s. Within the bo&s;om of this charm|ing retreat we lived, in a &s;tate of uninterrupted en|joyment, until our felicity was invaded by two unex|pected events, at which, I am afraid, we &s;hall always have cau&s;e to repine. My nephew, who had &s;ucceeded to my father's e&s;tate, died of the &s;mall|pox; and a few weeks after this incident, my wife's only brother broke his neck in leaping a five barred gate; &s;o that we found our&s;elves, all at once, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very opulent fortune, and violently tran&s;ported from that &s;ituation for which our tempers had been &s;o well adapted.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t flutter and agitation of mind, occa|&s;ioned by this unhoped for acce&s;&s;ion, we quitted our
<PB N="99" REF="108">
romantic &s;olitude, and ru&s;hed into all the pageantry of high life. Thus irre&s;i&s;tibly carried away by the vortex of di&s;&s;ipation, we grew giddy in a whirl of unnatural diver&s;ions; we became enamoured of tin&s;el liveries, equipage, and all the frippery of fa&s;hion. In&s;tead of tranquillity, health, a continued flow of &s;atisfaction, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rational de|lights, which we formerly derived from temperance, exerci&s;e, the &s;tudy of nature, and the practice of benevolence, we now ta&s;ted no plea&s;ure but what con&s;i&s;ted in the gratification of idle vanity, and were to&s;&s;ed for ever on a &s;ea of ab&s;urd amu&s;ements, by &s;uch loud &s;torms of riot and tumult, as drowned the voice of rea&s;on and reflection, and overwhelmed all the be&s;t faculties of the &s;oul. We de&s;erted na|ture, &s;entiment, and true ta&s;te, to lead a weary life of affectation, folly, and intemperance: our &s;en&s;es became &s;o depraved, that our eyes were capti|vated with glitter, and our ears with clamour; while our fancy dwelt with plea&s;ure on every gew-gaw of gothic extravagance. We entertained gue&s;ts whom we de&s;pi&s;ed; we vi&s;ited friends whom we did not love, and invited company whom we could not e&s;teem. We drank wines that we could not reli&s;h, and ate victuals which we could not dige&s;t. We frequented concerts which we did not under&s;tand, plays which we did not like, and diver&s;ions which we could not enjoy. Our hou&s;e might have been termed the Temple of Uproar. Card tables were the &s;hrines, and the votaries
<PB N="100" REF="109">
&s;eemed agitated by the daemons of envy, &s;pite, rage, vexation, and de&s;pair. In a word&mdash;all was farce and form. All was a phanta&s;m, and a hideous dream of incoherent ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>The&s;e plea&s;ures, like brandy to a dram-drinker, have lo&s;t their effect; we have waked from the in|toxication, to a due &s;en&s;e of our mi&s;erable condi|tion; for the vigour both of mind and body is quite impaired. With re&s;pect to each other, we find our|&s;elves in a &s;tate of mutual di&s;gu&s;t; and all the en|joyments of life we either ta&s;te with indifference, or reject with loathing. For my own part, I am over|whelmed with what the French call <HI>Pennui,</HI> a di&s;|temper for which there is not a name in the Engli&s;h language. It may be under&s;tood, however, from the following lines of the poet&mdash;
<Q><L>Thee, too, my Paridel, &s;he &s;aw thee there,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on the rack of a too ea&s;y chair;</L>
<L>And heard thy everla&s;ting yawn confe&s;s,</L>
<L>The pains and penalties of idlene&s;s.</L></Q>
It is not a common vacancy of thought, or an ordi|nary languor of the nerves, that I labour under, but a confirmed imbecillity of mind, and a want of reli&s;h, attended with a thou&s;and unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, which render life almo&s;t in&s;upportable. I &s;leep without refre&s;hment; I am fatigued without labour; I am &s;carce ri&s;en when I wi&s;h the day was done; and when night comes, I long for morning. I eat without appetite, and drink without exhilaration:
<PB N="101" REF="110">
exerci&s;e affords no &s;pirits; conver&s;ation no amu&s;e|ment; reading no entertainment, and diver&s;ion no plea&s;ure. It is not from affectation, but an ac|quired in&s;en&s;ibility, that I &s;ee Fal&s;taff without a &s;mile, and The Orphan without emotion. I endea|vour to kill the time by &s;hifting continually the &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation, but I am clo&s;e pur&s;ued by di&s;gu&s;t: all is di&s;appointment, in&s;ipid, nau&s;eous, or &s;hocking. My temper is grown &s;o fretful and peevi&s;h, that I quarrel by turns with my &s;ervants and my&s;elf; even &s;he who was once the delight of my eyes, and the joy of my heart, is now become the &s;ubject of per|petual di&s;quiet. I harbour wi&s;hes which I dare not approve: my heart palpitates with pa&s;&s;ions which I am a&s;hamed to avow. I am tormented by a thou|&s;and petty grievances, which ri&s;e like angry tu|mours, from the ebullitions of a &s;oured di&s;po&s;ition; and incidents that would move the mirth of other men, are to me productive of choler and anxiety.</P>
<P>I have given this account of my&s;elf, as a le&s;&s;on which I fear mankind will not learn, as a warning of dangers into which, whenever they have an opportunity, they will too eagerly ru&s;h. I &s;peak this generally, for I confe&s;s I am not with|out hope, that &s;ome very, very few, may be wi&s;e enough to profit by my example, and either be happy in mediocrity, or employ the redundancies of riches to better purpo&s;es, than in &s;upplying the fooli&s;h and incoherent whims and caprices of fa&s;hionable folly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HAVE frequently &s;poken to you, my children, of the many examples which hi&s;tory affords of tho&s;e who have become eminent by their great qua|lities. I have endeavoured to divert while my aim has been to in&s;truct; and in giving you &s;ome|times real, and &s;ometimes fictitious &s;tories, have taught you what you ought to do and &s;uffer in your future commerce with the world, without exhibit|ing the forbidding countenance of a dry and har&s;h preceptor. It is my wi&s;h to continue this practice, to in&s;pire you with the ardor of emulation, and to convince you, from facts, that virtue is its own reward. It has been my cu&s;tom too, in order to diver&s;ify the &s;cene, to let you indulge, occa&s;ionally, in the wild fictions of romance; for I have long ob&s;erved of my&s;elf, that I can &s;till read the mo&s;t romantic tales, if ingeniou&s;ly connected, with a fort of &s;urprize and curio&s;ity, that lead me in&s;en&s;ibly be|yond the limits of nature, and tran&s;port me into a kind of enchanted land, in which, for a time, I take up a delightful abode. I am &s;en&s;ible that with young people, of your age, this effect is much &s;tronger. The vagaries of fancy, like "the poet's eye in a fine fit of phrenzy rolling, traver&s;e the heavens and earth, embodying forth the forms of
<PB N="103" REF="112">
things unknown, and giving to airy nothing a local habitation and a name." The&s;e, if not permitted too often, &s;o as to blunt the imagination by a too repeated appeal to probability, are &s;ome of the hap|pie&s;t delu&s;ions of life.</P>
<P>Ea&s;tern tales are, many of them, of this &s;ort; but there is this difference between them: tho&s;e which are compo&s;ed at pre&s;ent, by modern authors, generally are intended to convey a particular moral, whereas the old ones, I mean the Arabian Nights, the Per&s;ian Tales, &amp;c. mean only to amu&s;e. The&s;e latter, it is true, do likewi&s;e inculcate morality; they cannot avoid it; all human events do the &s;ame; but then it is in a diffu&s;e and different way. I make no &s;cruple of reading the former kind in this little &s;ociety, becau&s;e they promote my plan; the others, for the rea&s;ons I have ju&s;t given, I u&s;e more &s;paringly, and only for the &s;ake of variety. This is not the fir&s;t time, my children, I have hinted to you, that I think it proper to explain my&s;elf thus, that you may not have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e I act caprici|ou&s;ly. I fit among you in the &s;acred character of Father, Guide, and In&s;tructor. Nature, rea&s;on, and cu&s;tom, have allotted me a certain portion of power, and I wi&s;h to convince you, that it is my endea|vour, as well as my duty, to employ that power in promoting your pre&s;ent and future pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>As I was looking through the Per&s;ian Tales this morning, in order to &s;ee if I could find any thing proper for our evening-meetings, I met, among
<PB N="104" REF="113">
other things, with the voyage of Aboulfaouaris, in which, though intermixed with the familiar inci|dents of real life, there is an air of invention and &s;ublimity that has &s;ometimes a grand effect. It is rather long: you had better, therefore, two or three of you, read by turns, and then tell me if you are of my opinion. As I ob&s;erved before, there is &s;el|dom any &s;ole and particular moral to be gained from this kind of &s;tories; the virtue, however, that is mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the following narrative, as well as the nece&s;&s;ity of that virtue in the &s;ituations de&s;cribed, is Fortitude.</P>

<HEAD>FORTITUDE, Or the &s;ingular Adventures of ABOULFAOUARIS, &s;urnamed the GREAT TRAVELLER. PART I.</HEAD>
<P>I AM the &s;on of a ma&s;ter of a &s;hip of Ba&s;ra, and my name is Aboulfaouaris. My father, ever &s;ince my infancy, made me attend him in the voy|ages he made in the Indian &s;eas: &s;o that, at twelve years old, I knew a great many of the i&s;lands that lie in the va&s;t extent of them. He grew wealthy, employed his money in trade, and in le&s;s than ten years became one of the riche&s;t merchants of Ba&s;ra.</P>
<P>One day he &s;aid to me, &s;on, I have an important account to &s;ettle with my corre&s;pondent at the i&s;le
<PB N="105" REF="114">
of Ceylon: I am re&s;olved to &s;end you into that country to make an end of the affair. Whatever regret I might have to leave my father, the de&s;ire I had of &s;eeing the famous city of Serendib made me accept the commi&s;&s;ion he offered me with joy: indeed I had been there before, but was not then advanced enough in years to make ob&s;ervations on its beauty. I &s;et out in a &s;hort time, and embarked in the port of Ba&s;ra.</P>
<P>We had the good fortune to reach Ceylon with|out any mi&s;chievous accident. The fir&s;t thing I did was to enquire for my father's corre&s;pondent. There was no body in the city of Serendib who did not know Signior Habib: he was one of the riche&s;t traders of all the i&s;land, and a very hone&s;t man. He gave me &s;uch a reception, as I might expect from the be&s;t friend my father had.</P>
<P>As he perfectly under&s;tood bu&s;ine&s;s, and meant to do nothing but what was ju&s;t, we fini&s;hed our ac|counts in a few days. At lei&s;ure hours I viewed the rarities of the city, which are numerous: I in|&s;tructed my&s;elf in the laws of the people, their oc|cupations and government. In &s;hort, at the end of five or &s;ix weeks, my affairs being over, and my curio&s;ity fully &s;atisfied, I prepared for my return, and waited not long for an opportunity. A ve&s;&s;el of Surat, which had arrived at Serendib to exchange goods, was ready to put to &s;ea, and I was to em|bark in her.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="115">The day before my departure, as I was returning to my ho&s;t about noon, a lady pa&s;&s;ed by, finely &s;haped, richly cloathed, and followed by a &s;lave, who carried &s;ome things that &s;he had been buying. A thick veil &s;creened the beauty of her face, but I was &s;truck with the grandeur of her air, and the maje&s;ty of her mien. I &s;topt to con&s;ider her, and could not forbear crying out in my tran&s;port; What a lovely creature! &s;he is without doubt the king's mi&s;tre&s;s. She &s;topt with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, and looked upon me very earne&s;tly; then continued her walk, without appearing to be either plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;ed with the freedom I had taken. I pau&s;ed a good while, reflecting on the circum&s;tance; and, much agi|tated by the emotions &s;he had cau&s;ed in me, began to feel what I had never felt before.</P>
<P>Wholly filled with this idea, a &s;lave acco&s;ted me. I remembered to be the &s;ame that followed the lady: and the &s;ight of him redoubled my concern: What would you have with me, friend? &s;aid I. Sir, an&s;wered he, with great re&s;pect, I have orders to de&s;ire you to follow, where I &s;hall have the ho|nour to conduct you. If you come from your mi&s;|tre&s;s, replied I, altogether amazed, I &s;hall &s;ubmit to her commands; I will readily obey them, whatever fate is prepared for me. My mi&s;tre&s;s, an&s;wered the &s;lave, hath not intru&s;ted me with her intentions; but if you comply with her reque&s;t, I cannot believe you will repent it.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="116">In vain did I repre&s;ent to my&s;elf that I was to &s;et off next day, and ought to think of nothing but my departure. I followed the &s;lave in &s;pite of all that might happen; he led me through unfrequented &s;treets, till we came to a palace: then conducted me to a &s;pacious apartment, magnificently furni&s;hed, and de&s;ired me to wait. I was too much affected to bu&s;y my&s;elf about any thing I &s;aw; I thought of nothing but the mi&s;tre&s;s of the palace.</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;he appeared, and I found her as beauti|ful as her &s;hape had promi&s;ed: her jewels and dre&s;s added to her charms, which, indeed, had little need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I was confounded &mdash; &s;he per|ceived it and &s;miled; then placed her&s;elf upon a &s;ofa, like a little throne, while her women ranked them&s;elves upon the right and left.</P>
<P>Come near young gentleman, &s;aid &s;he, with great &s;weetne&s;s; you &s;eem to be a &s;tranger: I will ven|ture to tell you, that the &s;tars incline me to wi&s;h you well. Should you render your&s;elf de&s;erving of my good opinion, I may give you leave to a&s;pire to plea&s;e me.</P>
<P>Ah, my &s;ultane&s;s! cried I, throwing my&s;elf at her feet, do I under&s;tand you right? To what pitch of fortune are you plea&s;ed to rai&s;e a &s;tranger, who hath no other merit than to acknowledge you adorable? So much the better, &s;aid &s;he, interrupting me, the favour will be the greater, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> believe you merit it. Inform me of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> country you

are, what your birth, and upon what account you came to Serendib.</P>
<P>I fully &s;atisfied her curio&s;ity; but when I &s;aid I was to go on board the next day, in order to return home, &s;he di&s;covered great concern. What, Aboul|faouaris, &s;aid &s;he, hare you a de&s;ign to depart &s;o &s;oon? Hath not the fine&s;t i&s;land of the Indies, charms enough to detain you longer? Prince&s;s, replied I, the city of Serendib, without doubt, can engage eyes more difficult to plea&s;e than mine; but what won|ders &s;oever are to be &s;een within the compa&s;s of the&s;e walls, I &s;hould withdraw my&s;elf without diffi|culty, if this day had not offered to my &s;ight what is more capable of detaining me. You no longer continue then, replied the lady &s;miling, in the re&s;o|lution of a &s;udden departure? After the glorious hopes, an&s;wered I, that you give me rea&s;on to conceive, think you, my queen, that I can have other inclinations than what you are plea&s;ed to in|&s;pire me with?&mdash;You cannot fail, &s;aid &s;he, with &s;en|timents like the&s;e, to plea&s;e me.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, &s;he bade me &s;it down on the &s;ofa: I made &s;ome difficulty, till &s;he &s;aid my refu&s;al would di&s;plea&s;e her. She then informed me her name was Canzada; that &s;he was daughter to one of the prime vi&s;iers of the king of Ceylon; that the death of her father had given her the right to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf; that the fir&s;t lords of the country had paid her their addre&s;&s;es, but that &s;he was yet di&s;engaged. She told me likewi&s;e that my per&s;on
<PB N="109" REF="118">
had &s;truck her; that her father had ama&s;&s;ed immen&s;e riches; and that it would be my own fault if I re|fu&s;ed to &s;hare them with her.</P>
<P>I returned my acknowledgments to her in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive terms. Our conver&s;ation was in|terrupted by the arrival of twelve &s;laves, who pre|&s;ently covered the table with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fruits. Canzada made me &s;it down by her: we began to eat, and &s;he helped me to the mo&s;t excellent. The variety and delicacy of the wines an&s;wered to that of the provi&s;ions: they &s;parkled in cups of cry&s;tal, but animated me much le&s;s than the looks of the lady, who, pre&s;enting a cup to me with a &s;miling air, kindled a flame in my heart, which increa&s;ed every moment.</P>
<P>During the repa&s;t, her conver&s;ation was very lively; the plea&s;antry of her humour added new graces to it. Every time that &s;he offered me wine, her beautiful lips ta&s;ting fir&s;t, rendered it &s;till more delicious; I took the cup with tran&s;port, and as I drank the liquor, &s;wallowed the &s;weet poi&s;on of love.</P>
<P>At the end of the repa&s;t, Canzada's women di|vided them&s;elves into two companies; &s;ome &s;inging, others dancing. While they were chanting their &s;oft airs, the eyes of Canzada and mine &s;poke in dumb language the mo&s;t tender and delicate &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>Night coming on, I would have taken leave of the lady: how, &s;aid &s;he to me, with an air of di&s;&s;a|tisfaction, do you think of leaving me? After the
<PB N="110" REF="119">
a&s;&s;urances you have given me of having no other will than mine, could I expect &s;o ill a compliment? For a man in love, your impatience &s;eems very &s;ur|pri&s;ing. Ah madam! cried I, how ill you interpret the &s;entiments of my heart! This reception, of which I appear not to know the value, rai&s;es the &s;ofte&s;t ideas in my &s;oul. I fear to abu&s;e your favours, and you &s;hould rather pity me for the conflict I feel in offering to quit you. You de&s;erve little pity, replied &s;he, for a conflict you might have avoided; &s;uch an over-di&s;cretion is to be &s;u&s;pected; I would not advi&s;e you to think it meritorious. How, ma|dam, &s;aid I, could I flatter my&s;elf that you had de&s;|tined me to pa&s;s the night in your palace?</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all the &s;atisfaction her goodne&s;s had procured me, I could not deny but that I was unea&s;y. I related to her the reception that my ho&s;t had given me at my arrival at Serendib, re|pre&s;enting to her that he was mo&s;t certainly in great unea&s;ine&s;s concerning me.</P>
<P>Canzada agreed that I ought to &s;end to Habib, but &s;he would not permit me to go my&s;elf: &s;he only gave me leave to write to him, but at the &s;ame time forbade me to give him the lea&s;t hint of my adven|ture. Her di&s;tru&s;t was &s;o great, that &s;he dictated the letter; and I could only acquaint him, that &s;ome important bu&s;ine&s;s had retarded my departure, and deprived me of the happine&s;s of &s;eeing him for &s;ome days, and that I de&s;ired he would be under no apprehen&s;ions on my account.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="120">Plea&s;ed that I had put off my departure, &s;he led me into the &s;everal apartments of her palace, and &s;hewed me a magnificence that &s;eemed worthy of a prime vi&s;ier. When the hour of re&s;t came on, &s;he conducted me to an apartment prepared for me. She left me, and was no &s;ooner gone, but &s;laves, who were commanded to attend me, brought every thing that was proper for the occa&s;ion, and put me to bed.</P>
<P>When I found my&s;elf alone, and at liberty to re|flect &s;eriou&s;ly on this adventure, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, What will all this come to? How richly this pa|lace is furni&s;hed! Can I ever hope to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lady? No, Aboulfaouaris, no; this was never de&s;igned for thee; cea&s;e to flatter thy&s;elf: the&s;e are &s;nares which fortune hath laid, and thou wilt pre|&s;ently find them vani&s;hing like a dream, and deceiving thee in tho&s;e ideas of greatne&s;s and plea&s;ure, which thou imagine&s;t are re&s;erved for thee.</P>
<P>This thought failed not to di&s;turb me. In a mi|nute after, I fancied it was wrong to alarm my&s;elf; that Canzada could have no intere&s;t to deceive me, and therefore that I ought not to &s;u&s;pect her kind|ne&s;s: that the behaviour of her people had appear|ed to me very &s;incere and natural; and that I had ob&s;erved, by her eyes, &s;he was touched with a real pa&s;&s;ion for me: &s;o that &s;ometimes repo&s;ing an entire confidence in her, and &s;ometimes giving way to my fears, like a ve&s;&s;el agitated by two contrary winds, I pa&s;&s;ed the whole night without a moment of re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="121">Break of day &s;urpri&s;ed me, while I was yet re|flecting with great concern on what had employed me in the night: the &s;un &s;hone into my apartment, and made the rich furniture glitter: dazled by the brightne&s;s, I looked upon the palace as one of tho&s;e enchanted ca&s;tles, where magic art, getting the conque&s;t of nature, boa&s;ts the va&s;t extent of its power. I got up, and pre&s;ently the &s;laves hearing me walk, came into the room with magnificent robes; I took one of green &s;ilk, embroidered with gold, the work and de&s;ign of which plea&s;ed me in|finitely.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner dre&s;&s;ed, than Canzada came to a&s;k me if I had re&s;ted well; her impatience of &s;eeing me again would not &s;uffer her to wait till I could go to find her in her own apartment. I an&s;wered, that I had pa&s;&s;ed the night in a manner that ought to ha&s;ten the moment of my happine&s;s. She replied, &s;miling, that &s;he would be more fully informed of my &s;ince|rity, before &s;he made a further progre&s;s of &s;uch con&s;equence to her quiet.</P>
<P>I remained eight days in Canzada's palace, and was treated with the re&s;pect due to a king. The lady &s;hewed a particular regard for me; &s;he refu&s;ed me no &s;igns of tenderne&s;s and complai&s;ance that I could de&s;ire of her, compatible with virtue.</P>
<P>One day, when we were walking in the garden, Aboulfaouaris, &s;aid &s;he, I flatter my&s;elf that you love me; in this confidence, I am at la&s;t re&s;olved to compleat your wi&s;hes; to give you, with my
<PB N="113" REF="122">
per&s;on, the free di&s;po&s;al of my wealth. &mdash; After this, can you refu&s;e me any thing? Ah madam! &s;aid I, interrupting her, with all the marks of real gratitude, this doubt is injurious to my pa&s;&s;ion. Speak! were it my life, it would be glory enough to &s;acrifice it to the lea&s;t of your de&s;ires. That which I &s;hall a&s;k, replied the lady, will be a favour be&s;towed on you, if you love me, as I would fain believe. Explain your&s;elf then, cried I, it is too much to be kept in &s;u&s;pence. The favour I have to a&s;k you, &s;aid &s;he, is to &s;ecure my repo&s;e and hap|pine&s;s. Promi&s;e! &s;wear to me an eternal con|&s;tancy! and to prevent the chagrin of &s;eeing our|&s;elves &s;eparated, join the gift of your hand to that of your heart. Let us be linked together by the &s;acred tie of marriage.</P>
<P>Though the beginning of Canzada's di&s;cour&s;e had filled me with joy, her la&s;t words produced a quite contrary effect. Though &s;he had behaved with the &s;tricte&s;t decorum, yet I never imagined &s;he thought of marriage, for &s;he was of the &s;ect of the Guebres, who are the ancient Per&s;ians that adore the fire, and I a Mahometan; &s;o that &s;he rai&s;ed in me an extra|ordinary a&s;toni&s;hment. I was di&s;turbed, I grew pale, I reddened, I ca&s;t down my eyes; confu&s;ion and perplexity took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e cheeks, on which joy was revelling but the moment before.</P>
<P>The lady, who ob&s;erved me with attention, ea&s;ily penetrated the cau&s;e of my di&s;order. I could not have believed, &s;aid &s;he, with a fierce and di&s;dainful
<PB N="114" REF="123">
air, that &s;uch a propo&s;al would have been &s;o di&s;a|greeable to you; I rather expected tran&s;ports of joy from you, than this confu&s;ion. What, is it a di&s;|honour to have me for your wife? Madam, an&s;wer|ed I, I know the value of that glorious degree, to which your bounty would rai&s;e me, but Heaven hath placed an invincible ob&s;truction in the way; and if you &s;ee trouble and confu&s;ion cover my face, it is becau&s;e I mourn in &s;ecret my misfortune, which will not permit me to accept of an offer, which otherwi&s;e would crown my glory and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I imagined, replied &s;he, that my rank was the &s;ole ob&s;tacle to your good fortune. When I deba&s;ed my&s;elf to you, I thought I had removed all diffi|culties: but tell me, pur&s;ued &s;he, what is that ob|&s;tacle that you take to be &s;o invincible. My reli|gion, replied I. How can I break through the command, which prohibits us to marry a wife, who is no follower of Mahomet. I am not le&s;s &s;crupu|lous in my religion than you, replied Canzada, and would not for an empire marry with a Mahometan. I de&s;igned, therefore, to make you renounce the fal&s;e doctrine of your prophet, and oblige you to embrace the &s;ect of the Guebres. I reckoned upon your wor&s;hipping the fire and the &s;un. In &s;hort, that you would abjure your own religion to follow mine. I confe&s;s, I promi&s;ed my&s;elf, to have made it a merit in the eyes of the god we adore, to make a convert of the per&s;on whom I loved, even to the degree of delivering up to him all my trea&s;ure; but
<PB N="115" REF="124">
you deny me the advantage of &s;uch a merit, and, de|&s;pi&s;ing the tender I make you of a large fortune, ra|ther than con&s;ent to marry me, you become the mo&s;t ungrateful of all men.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words, and the tone in which Can|zada pronounced them, increa&s;ed my confu&s;ion, and furni&s;hed new occa&s;ion to &s;tir up her re&s;entment again&s;t me. She loaded me with reproaches, and &s;hed tears, which pierced my heart every in&s;tant: how formidable was &s;he in this condition to a lover who was willing to pre&s;erve his virtue! my own grief, and that which &s;he felt, deprived me al|mo&s;t of my &s;en&s;es. Alas! there wanted but little to conquer me, and I had without doubt &s;acrificed all to her tears, if, &s;ecretly in&s;pired by Mahomet, I had not received from the grand prophet the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance I wanted: but I remained firm in my re&s;olu|tion, and ob&s;erved the precept of my religion.</P>
<P>Canzada was much a&s;toni&s;hed that an adherence to my faith was capable of making me renounce the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her and her riches. She had heard of &s;ome Mu&s;&s;ulman le&s;s &s;crupulous than my&s;elf, and my firmne&s;s grieved her much; neverthele&s;s, che|ri&s;hing yet hopes that at the end I &s;hould yield, &s;he would not take my refu&s;al for a final an&s;wer. The inju&s;tice and cruelty of your proceedings, &s;aid &s;he to me, ought before now to have tired my pa|tience; I blu&s;h that I am &s;till &s;o weak as to have the lea&s;t inclination for you. However, I will yet believe you will change your opinion; I give you
<PB N="116" REF="125">
eight days &s;till to determine: you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to reproach me, that I give you not time to con|&s;ider: but, if after that, you take not a re&s;olution of doing what I require of you; if you per&s;i&s;t to render your&s;elf unworthy of my bounty, expect all the mo&s;t rigorous re&s;entment an enraged woman can inflict.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words &s;he left me with an air that might convince me, &s;he would effectually come to the la&s;t extremity, if I did not re&s;olve to marry her. I was left in the mo&s;t deplorable condition imaginable. Nothing was equal to my con&s;ternation. I could &s;ee no hopes that I could be happy, unle&s;s I would abjure Mahometani&s;m. And could I re&s;olve on that? charming Canzada, cried I to my&s;elf &s;ighing, I may no longer rai&s;e my de&s;ires to your enjoyment. But though I have lo&s;t the hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you, it is not in my power to cea&s;e loving you; at what di&s;tance &s;oever you are from me, you will be the &s;o|vereign of my heart.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the eight days that were given me in la|menting the good fortune I had once conceived hopes of; but I had courage enough not to alter my re&s;olution. Canzada perceiving at the end of the time &s;he had pre&s;cribed that I was not yet in the proper di&s;po&s;ition, granted me eight days more; and, to contribute on her part to the victory &s;he de&s;igned to gain, &s;he made u&s;e of her mo&s;t pow|erful charms. In &s;hort, &s;eeing the time elap&s;e again, without having gained any advantage, &s;he &s;ent for
<PB N="117" REF="126">
me. I was conducted into the mo&s;t &s;tately apart|ment of the palace: She waited for me in the mid&s;t of her women, upon a throne rai&s;ed a few &s;teps from the floor, and had more the air of a &s;evere judge, than of a compa&s;&s;ionate mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I approached trembling, and could &s;carce make u&s;e of my &s;en&s;es. She ordered her women to leave the room. Well, Aboulfaouaris, &s;aid &s;he, have your reflections in&s;pired your &s;tubborn heart with &s;entiments that are worthy of me? I was &s;truck to the very &s;oul, and fainted at the foot of the throne.</P>
<P>Canzada de&s;cended from the throne, and was bu&s;y to help me. I perceived it when I came to my&s;elf, and opening my eyes, fixed them on the lady. Cea&s;e, madam, &s;aid I, with a low voice, cea&s;e to concern your&s;elf for a wretch, who is not worthy your care. It is true, &s;aid &s;he, interrupting me with &s;ome emotion, that I have rea&s;on to complain of you; but it is your own fault. Forget your inju&s;tice, and accept an advantage you cannot too much cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>Alas! madam, cried I, in an accent of grief and de&s;pair, what can I gain by your love on &s;uch cruel conditions as you propo&s;e to me? When I am the reward of your compliance, replied the lady, ought you to balance any con&s;iderations again&s;t &s;o great an acqui&s;ition? Would you have me believe, that there is &s;omething dearer to you than my&s;elf? You are dearer to me than all things, replied I; but can
<PB N="118" REF="127">
I be worthy of you, if I have the weakne&s;s and cowardice to fully my honour by renouncing my religion&mdash;. Peace, peace, perfidious man, cried &s;he, interrupting me with the utmo&s;t pa&s;&s;ion: Make u&s;e no more of your fal&s;e rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify pretences that would not di&s;quiet you, had you really loved me. But go, thou art unworthy of my favours. I am at length re&s;olved; and leave thee to thy own ingra|titude.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, which much agitated me, &s;he &s;tood &s;ilent: Then re-a&s;&s;uming her &s;peech with an air of coldne&s;s, which confe&s;&s;ed no le&s;s rage than the accent in which &s;he &s;poke: Aboulfaouaris, pur&s;ued &s;he, never let me &s;ee you more; wait my orders; you &s;hall &s;oon be acquainted with what I determine concerning your fate. In &s;peaking thus, &s;he left the apartment with an emotion equal to mine; but we were moved with quite different pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I then knew what I had to apprehend from the di&s;po&s;ition in which I found things. If at times I was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate a lover, as to think with plea&s;ure of dying by the hands of the object beloved; at others, the love for life made me think of means to e&s;cape. But how &s;hould I obtain my end? I was kept always in &s;ight, and the lady's orders were all exactly performed. Nor could I ever find means to inform my ho&s;t of the place where I was.</P>
<P>Every day I expected to hear what &s;entence &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed upon me, and three weeks elap&s;ed with|out hearing any thing. The incertainty in which I
<PB N="119" REF="128">
lived, had &s;omething in it more terrible than any &s;entence they could pronounce. I de&s;ired to have an end put to this &s;u&s;pence, let what would be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the moment I wi&s;hed for came. As I was ri&s;ing to dre&s;s my&s;elf one morning, after having &s;pent a night more trouble&s;ome than u&s;ual, five or &s;ix of Canzada's &s;laves entered my chamber. They conducted a number of people, habited otherwi&s;e than tho&s;e of Serendib; he who appeared to be the chief of the&s;e &s;trangers, looked upon me &s;ome time with attention; and at la&s;t gravely broke &s;ilence, and bid me follow him. He &s;aid this with an air, which made me conclude that I mu&s;t obey him.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the palace, and when we were got to the gate, I a&s;ked one of my conductors, whither they pretended to carry me. That you will know in time, an&s;wered he; but we are expre&s;ly forbid to tell you. The&s;e men conducted me to the port; I embarked with them; they pre&s;ently got ready; and we &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>When we were out at &s;ea, the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip informed me, that he was of the kingdom of Gol|conda, that Canzada had given me to him for a &s;lave, and that he was charged particularly never to grant me liberty to return to Ba&s;ra; he &s;aid no more, nor a&s;ked me any que&s;tion about that lady. This gave me room to judge, that &s;ince &s;he had hid from him her affections for me, and the affront of my refu&s;ing her, &s;he had engaged him to promi&s;e,
<PB N="120" REF="129">
that he would not inform him&s;elf of the rea&s;ons &s;he had to rid her hands of me.</P>
<P>Such was the revenge of Canzada; whom I can|not accu&s;e of rigour. She puni&s;hed me too mildly for the crime that I had been guilty of. When I reflected, however, that I &s;hould return no more to my father, or my country, my &s;lavery became in&s;up|portable. I afflicted my&s;elf much at fir&s;t; but making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, I &s;tudied to &s;erve my ma&s;ter faithfully, who was a very good man, and did not want &s;en&s;e. I was not &s;atisfied merely to do what he ordered me, I endeavoured to prevent his de&s;ires, and found from time to time he was more and more plea&s;ed with me.</P>

<HEAD>The ADVENTURES of ABOULFAOUARIS. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;ailed round the I&s;land of Ceylon to come northward into the Gulph of Bengal, and were ju&s;t ready to enter the Gulph, when the mo&s;t violent &s;torm aro&s;e that was ever &s;een in tho&s;e &s;eas. We wanted a full &s;outh wind to carry us to the north|ward; but a north we&s;t wind drove us directly &s;outh-ea&s;t, quite contrary to our intended cour&s;e for Golconda. We were driven we knew not whither; the &s;torm wearied the art of the mariners; who &s;eeing them&s;elves in danger, quitted their labour, and left the ve&s;&s;el to the plea&s;ure of the winds and waves.</P>
<P>This wind la&s;ted fifteen days, with &s;uch impe|tuo&s;ity, that it carried us &s;ix hundred leagues out of
<PB N="122" REF="131">
our cour&s;e. It changed at la&s;t, and filled us with joy; but we were di&s;turbed by an adventure &s;o very extraordinary as &s;carcely to appear credible.</P>
<P>We were on the point of the I&s;le of Java, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, when we perceived near us a man &s;trug|gling again&s;t the waves, to keep him&s;elf from &s;inking. He kept fa&s;t hold of a plank, that &s;upported him, and made &s;igns to us to come and help him. Com|pa&s;&s;ion is commendable, but &s;ometimes very dan|gerous; as you will under&s;tand by the &s;equel.</P>
<P>We hoi&s;ted out our boat, and brought him aboard. He appeared to be about forty years old; of a mon&s;trous &s;hape; his head large, his hair &s;hort and thick, his mouth exce&s;&s;ively wide; his teeth ap|peared long, and very &s;harp: his arms nervous, his hands large, and on each finger a long crooked nail. His eyes, which I had done wrong to omit, re&s;embled tho&s;e of a tiger, and he had a flat no&s;e, with very open no&s;trils. His whole phy&s;iognomy was &s;hocking, and he had a &s;ullen air, capable of changing into terror that compa&s;&s;ion with which he at fir&s;t in&s;pired us.</P>
<P>When he was brought to Dehaou&s;ch the ma&s;ter, he &s;aid, Sir, I owe my life to you; I was upon the point of peri&s;hing without your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is true, replied the ma&s;ter, you had been pre&s;ently drowned, if you had not had the good fortune to meet us.&mdash;It is not the &s;ea which I feared, an&s;wers the man, &s;miling; I could live whole years in the water without hurt. That which torments me mo&s;t
<PB N="123" REF="132">
is a devouring hunger, that gnaws me; for it is almo&s;t twelve hours &s;ince I have eat. Do me the favour to bring me &s;omething to repair my lo&s;t &s;trength after &s;o long a fa&s;t&mdash;never mind after what manner&mdash;I am far from nice.&mdash;I eat every thing.</P>
<P>We looked upon one another, and judged that the danger he had been in had undoubtedly di&s;turbed his &s;en&s;es, which was al&s;o the ma&s;ter's opinion, who, conceiving that he had full occa&s;ion to eat, ordered as much as would &s;erve &s;ix per&s;ons; with cloaths to cover him. As for cloaths, &s;aid the &s;tranger, I need none, I go always naked. But decency, replied Dehaou&s;ch, will not let you &s;tay with us in the condition you are in. Ho! replied the other rudely, you will &s;oon accu&s;tom your&s;elves to the &s;ight.</P>
<P>This brutal an&s;wer confirmed us in the opinion, that he was not in his &s;en&s;es. His hunger pre&s;&s;ed, and he was impatient to eat. He fell to kicking the hatches, grumbled, and rolled his eyes dreadfully. At length he &s;aw what he wanted, fell upon it with a greedine&s;s that &s;urpri&s;ed us; and in a moment di&s;patched it.</P>
<P>When he had eaten up all the provi&s;ion that had been brought him, with an air of authority he bid us bring more. The ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, willing to &s;ee the event, ordered that he &s;hould be obeyed, but this &s;econd &s;ervice was &s;oon &s;wallowed; and he demanded more to eat, when one of the &s;laves of
<PB N="124" REF="133">
the &s;hip, provoked with the in&s;olence of the brute, was going to treat him as he de&s;erved; but the &s;avage laid his two hands on his &s;houlders, and tore him to pieces with his &s;harp nails. In a moment no le&s;s than fifty &s;abres were lifted up again&s;t him, to revenge this horrid murder. Each man &s;truck at him with all the re&s;olution and boldne&s;s he was able; but we perceived, with dread, that our enemy had a &s;kin as impenetrable as a diamond: our &s;abres broke or turned their edges, without being able to make an impre&s;&s;ion. One man that was the mo&s;t eager again&s;t him he laid hold on, with an a&s;toni&s;h|ing force, and tore him to pieces before our eyes.</P>
<P>When we found our &s;abres u&s;ele&s;s, and that we could not wound him, we fell all together upon him to throw him into the &s;ea; but he was im|moveable: for, be&s;ides prodigious &s;trength, he &s;truck his crooked nails into the wood of the hatches, and kept his hold, like a rock in the mid&s;t of the waves. Far from being di&s;mayed at our attempt, he told us, with a &s;our &s;mile, my friends, you have under|taken an ill bu&s;ine&s;s; I have reduced tho&s;e who were as untractable as your&s;elves. If you continue to oppo&s;e my will, I &s;hall u&s;e you all I have done your two comrades.</P>
<P>Chilled with fear we made no further re&s;i&s;tance. A third time we fetched him &s;omething to eat, he &s;at down to table, and as &s;oon as he ob&s;erved that we were at la&s;t determined to &s;ubmit, he became good humoured. He now &s;eemed &s;orry that we had
<PB N="125" REF="134">
forced him to what he had done; and told us very calmly, that he e&s;teemed us for the &s;ervice we had done him, in taking him out of the &s;ea, where he mu&s;t have died of hunger in a few hours: that he wi&s;hed there would come &s;ome other ve&s;&s;el well &s;tored with provi&s;ions, becau&s;e he would then throw him&s;elf aboard her, and trouble us no farther. He laughed and je&s;ted like a common man, and we &s;hould have found him very diverting, if circum&s;tances would have permitted us to reli&s;h his plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he made a fourth meal, and then ab|&s;tained two hours from eating. During this in|terval, he a&s;ked us, one after another, about our country, cu&s;toms, and adventures. We hoped that the fumes of indige&s;tion would ri&s;e to his brain, and waited with impatience till &s;leep &s;hould over|power his &s;en&s;es, that we might throw him &s;ud|denly into the &s;ea. This hope was our only re|&s;ource; for though we had had ever &s;o much provi|&s;ion in our &s;hip, at his way of eating, he would have devoured it in a little time. But, alas! we flattered our&s;elves with vain hopes. This wretch, as if he had penetrated our de&s;igns, informed us he never &s;lept. The quantity that I eat, &s;ays he, re&s;tores the weakne&s;s of nature, and &s;erves in&s;tead of re&s;t.</P>
<P>We under&s;tood with grief this &s;ad truth. We deplored our ill fortune, and the ma&s;ter de&s;paired of ever returning to Golconda, when on a &s;udden the air appeared darkened, a tempe&s;t &s;eemed gathering, and we were the more glad of it, becau&s;e a &s;torm
<PB N="126" REF="135">
would afford us hopes of &s;aving our&s;elves. Our ve&s;&s;el might da&s;h again&s;t a rock as we came in &s;ight of &s;ome i&s;land, where we might by &s;wimming, per|haps, get rid of the mon&s;ter; who undoubtedly had promi&s;ed him&s;elf, after he had eaten up all our provi&s;ions, to devour the crew.</P>
<P>We wi&s;hed therefore for a violent tempe&s;t, and even prayed to heaven that we might &s;ink. But we were deceived; for what we took for a gathering of clouds and vapours, was only one of the large&s;t rokhs that was ever &s;een in tho&s;e &s;eas. This mon|&s;trous bird came &s;ou&s;e down impetuou&s;ly upon the deck, and &s;natched off our enemy from the mid&s;t of the &s;hip's crew, who had no time to arm him&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch a &s;urprize. We were not aware our|&s;elves of it till &s;ome moments after, when the bird was mounted in the air with his prey.</P>
<P>We then &s;aw an extraordinary combat; the man finding him&s;elf &s;u&s;pended in the air by the talons of a winged mon&s;ter, which he felt the &s;trength of, began now to defend him&s;elf. He had his hands at liberty; he &s;truck his hooked nails into the body of the rokh, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;etting his teeth upon his brea&s;t, he fell to devouring the fle&s;h and feathers, when the bird made &s;uch a hideous cry, as rent the air around; and to revenge it&s;elf, &s;truck out both the eyes of its enemy with one of its talons. Though blinded he quitted not his hold, but the rokh collecting together the remainder of &s;trength in death, pierced his head with one &s;troke
<PB N="127" REF="136">
of the beak; &s;o that both fell down dead into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Thus we find that it was written upon the table of prede&s;tination, that we &s;hould be delivered from this dangerous mon&s;ter. As &s;oon as we &s;aw our|&s;elves rid of him, we could not enough admire our good fortune, and were &s;orry for the death of the rokh who had delivered us. We continued our voyage, and entertained our&s;elves with this adven|ture. Having now a con&s;tant favourable wind, after &s;everal days &s;ail, we di&s;covered land. On the fir&s;t notice of it we took the altitudes, and found that we were on the we&s;t point of the I&s;le of Java, which, with the ea&s;t of the I&s;le of Sumatra, forms the entrance into the Streights of Sonde, not far from the City of Bantam. Overjoyed at this di&s;co|very, we crowded our &s;ails; and in a little time ar|rived at Bantam.</P>
<P>There we took in fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and &s;et &s;ail for Batavia. As &s;oon as Dehaou&s;ch had fini&s;hed his affairs there, we &s;ailed towards the kingdom of Gol|conda, where we arrived in about a month's navi|gation from the I&s;les of the Sonde.</P>
<P>My patron was received in the capital where he re&s;ided with a general applau&s;e, for he was beloved by every body.</P>
<P>After a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and care&s;&s;es from his family, he pre&s;ented me to his wife and daughter, as a &s;lave for whom he had a particular regard, and prayed them to take in good part the &s;ervices I &s;hould
<PB N="128" REF="137">
render them. In a little time I acquired great repu|tation with them. The other &s;laves, far from being jealous, appeared plea&s;ed to &s;ee me &s;o well treated. It is true that I procured them the be&s;t u&s;age I could, and often occa&s;ioned them to be better rewarded than they de&s;erved.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the friend&s;hip that Dehaou&s;ch had for me increa&s;ed &s;o much that he &s;aid to me one day; Aboulfaouaris, for I had neither hid from him my name nor my country, you cannot but have taken notice that I have ever di&s;tingui&s;hed you from the re&s;t of my &s;laves. At the fir&s;t in&s;tant that I &s;aw you, I took a fancy to you, and I have &s;pared no|thing to &s;often the rigour of your &s;lavery: I de&s;ign to give you yet greater marks of my affection. You have &s;een my daughter; there is not, perhaps, a more beautiful girl in Golconda. You &s;hall marry her; I have &s;ounded her upon this &s;ubject, and find you are not di&s;plea&s;ing to her.</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;tunned at this propo&s;ition, that it was not difficult for him to judge the news was not very agreeable to me. How! &s;aid he, does what I pro|po&s;e di&s;turb you? Is the advantage of being my heir, with the enjoyment of Facrinni&s;&s;a, &s;o very in|con&s;iderable, that it cannot rai&s;e the ambition of a &s;lave? Sir, an&s;wered I, the honour of being your &s;on-in-law would be &s;ufficient to tempt me, were you a Mu&s;&s;ulman as I am; but you are a Heathen.&mdash; If you have no other ob&s;tacle but that, replied my ma&s;ter, we &s;hall &s;oon agree; for I am re&s;olved to
<PB N="129" REF="138">
turn Mahometan, and my daughter is in the &s;ame re&s;olution: In &s;pite of the prejudices with which our Gentile prie&s;ts have filled my mind, I am weary of paying divine honours to oxen and cows: I have too much rea&s;on not to acknowledge it to be a wretched &s;uper&s;tition, and I think there is a &s;upreme Being above all other deities; therefore, my &s;on, accept my propo&s;al, without &s;cruple or delay.</P>
<P>Though Facrinni&s;&s;a was lovely, and the proffer advantageous; and though, on the &s;core of my re|ligion, I had nothing to reproach my&s;elf with in marrying my ma&s;ter's daughter, I had &s;till a re|luctance to this marriage, which could be no more than the effect of my remembrance of Canzada. However, I was &s;o far ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, as to &s;ay nothing of it to my patron, who, believing that I con&s;ented, as I made no oppo&s;ition to it, went to carry the news to his wife and daughter.</P>
<P>I had pre&s;ently a conver&s;ation with Facrinni&s;&s;a, who appeared &s;o gay and contented, that I could not help thinking that my per&s;on plea&s;ed her. Aboul|faouaris, &s;aid &s;he, my father hath made choice of you for my hu&s;band, and I doubt not of your gene|ro&s;ity towards the promoting of my good fortune, though at the lo&s;s of your own. You are not de|ceived in me, fair lady, an&s;wered I, there is nothing that I will not do for the charming Facrinni&s;&s;a. Hear me, replied &s;he, and you &s;hall under&s;tand the &s;ervice I require of you. I love the &s;on of a mer|chant of Golconda, and I am pa&s;&s;ionately beloved
<PB N="130" REF="139">
by him: he hath a&s;ked me of my father &s;everal times, who always refu&s;ed him, becau&s;e of an ancient grudge which is kept up betwixt our families. I would have you marry me, and, the day after our marriage divorce me, as through anger; afterwards feign as if you would take me again, and then chu&s;e my lover for your hulla. I under&s;tand you, &s;aid I, you only de&s;ire that I &s;hould marry you to deliver you up to him whom you love: very well, madam, I agree to do &s;o: how difficult &s;oever it will be to yield up the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an object, I think my|&s;elf capable of &s;o great a &s;elf-denial. But what will my ma&s;ter &s;ay? You are not ignorant of the obli|gations I have to him. Surpri&s;ed at my conduct, he will not fail to reproach me. What &s;hall I an&s;wer? Let not this give you any unea&s;ine&s;s, replied &s;he, follow exactly the advice I &s;hall give you, and I pro|mi&s;e you my father will not complain of you.</P>
<P>Upon the faith of this promi&s;e, I a&s;&s;ured her that I was di&s;po&s;ed to promote her love after the man|ner that &s;he de&s;ired. Charmed with this a&s;&s;urance, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed her father to ha&s;ten the marriage, which was celebrated in a few days&mdash;&s;he abjured her reli|gion beforehand, and embraced Mahometani&s;m. All I obtained from my union with Facrinni&s;&s;a, was obliging the lady to renounce her idolatry &s;ooner than &s;he would otherwi&s;e have done. Lovely as &s;he was, I &s;acrificed the rights of a hu&s;band to the ho|nour of keeping the promi&s;e I had given; and looked upon her only as a pledge entru&s;ted with me, which
<PB N="131" REF="140">
I was obliged honourably to re&s;tore. I was not long charged with it. A few days after our mar|riage I divorced her. My ma&s;ter, as I had fore&s;een, a&s;toni&s;hed at my proceeding, came to my hou&s;e: for you mu&s;t know, that the very day we were mar|ried, we lived in a hou&s;e by our&s;elves. He a&s;ked me for what rea&s;on I had divorced Facrinni&s;&s;a? I an&s;wered him, that I found &s;he had a pa&s;&s;ion for another, and that not being willing to po&s;&s;e&s;s a wo|man again&s;t her inclinations, I had repudiated her. He laughed at my nicene&s;s, and told me that his daughter would by degrees love me better. In &s;hort, he exhorted me to take her again, and I pretended I would. I will go into the city, &s;aid I to him, find out a hulla, and bring him this night before the cady: to-morrow we will renew our nuptials, in hopes of better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>My patron returned home &s;omething better &s;atis|fied; he left to me the care of chu&s;ing a hulla, and the re&s;t of the ceremony. I went and found out Facrinni&s;&s;a's lover, and they were married before me by the cady's lieutenant. They pa&s;&s;ed the night together. The next day the hulla refu&s;ing to di|vorce his wife, I went to my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and di&s;&s;embling a grief I never felt, told him that the hulla, contrary to what he had promi&s;ed me the day before, refu&s;ed to divorce the lady.</P>
<P>We ought to know who this hulla is, &s;aid De|haou&s;ch; if he is poor, I have reputation and mo|ney enough to take my daughter from him. Dur|ing
<PB N="132" REF="141">
the time he was &s;peaking, the nayb or cady's deputy came in, and &s;aid; "Sir, I come to inform you that the hulla, whom your &s;on-in-law hath cho|&s;en, is the &s;on of Amer, the merchant; therefore your daughter is lo&s;t as to her fir&s;t hu&s;band, for the &s;econd is re&s;olved never to part with her. I know very well that Amer is not your friend, but I would advi&s;e you to be reconciled to him in favour of this marriage, and forget the hatred you have &s;o long borne towards him."</P>
<P>The nayb, not contented to exhort my patron to an accommodation with the family of his new &s;on-in-law, offered to &s;peak him&s;elf to Amer, and &s;pare nothing to make them friends. Dehaou&s;ch rea&s;oned properly in this affair, and therefore was not hard to be reconciled; and the lieutenant finding Amer in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two fa|thers a perfect under&s;tanding. But the be&s;t of all was, my patron, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that I was the victim of this reconciliation, pitied me, and, by way of re|compen&s;e, gave me a large &s;um of money, with li|berty to return to Ba&s;ra.</P>
<P>Thus was Facrinni&s;&s;a freed from a hu&s;band for whom &s;he had no affection, and married to her lover. As &s;oon as I &s;aw their good fortune &s;ecured, I went from Golconda, and joining my&s;elf to &s;ome people who were going to Surat, got to the &s;ea|&s;ide, embarked in a ve&s;&s;el that pre&s;ently &s;et &s;ail, and we had a happy voyage. The next day, finding no &s;hipping ready to go for Ba&s;ra, I was obliged to &s;tay at Surat.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">The city of Surat is too agreeable, and too full of curio&s;ities, for one to be weary of it in a &s;hort time. I went &s;ometimes to the public baths, which are very fine, and where there is better attendance than in any other place in the world. I walked about the city and avenues, and in the many delight|ful gardens that are open to all &s;orts of people.</P>
<P>One day a man &s;omewhat advanced in years met me at the turn of an alley, &s;aluted me very civilly, and we joined conver&s;ation. He appeared frank and &s;incere, told me that he was a Gentile, and that he had in the road of Surat a ve&s;&s;el belonging to him, in which every year he made a voyage. To be equally free with him, I told him that I was a Mahometan, and related to him my adventures.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed &s;o &s;en&s;ible of my misfortunes, as to &s;urpri&s;e me. I ob&s;erve my &s;on, &s;aid he, that you are a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee me take part in your af|flictions: but, be&s;ides that I am naturally compa&s;|&s;ionate, I mu&s;t tell you that I have a great friend|&s;hip for you, though you are not of my religion. I am concerned at the dangers you have run through; and &s;hould you tell them to your own father, he could not feel him&s;elf more &s;en&s;ible of them than I am. O young man! cried he, how fortunate that I came to walk in the&s;e gardens! your conver&s;ation is agreeable to me, and every moment increa&s;es the affection I have conceived for you; let us go into the city and lodge together; I am old and rich; have no child; and will make you my heir. At
<PB N="134" REF="143">
the&s;e words, he took me in his arms, and embraced me with the tenderne&s;s of a father.</P>
<P>I thanked him for the&s;e offers of kindne&s;s, on his part, and made him lively prote&s;tations of grati|tude on mine. In &s;hort, the re&s;ult was, that he conducted me to his hou&s;e, which was one of the fine&s;t in Surat. When the porter opened the gate, I perceived, in&s;tead of a court, two parterres, with a profu&s;ion of flowers, divided by a large walk made of a compo&s;ition as hard and beautiful as marble. The walk led us to a fine building, where the fur|niture, though not rich, was elegant; the hangings and the &s;ofas were of painted linen, the figures ad|mirably wrought, and the linen exqui&s;itely fine.</P>
<P>The old man invited me to bathe with him in a large ba&s;on of tran&s;parent water, which &s;erved to re|fre&s;h him, as well as to fulfil the duties of his re|ligion. The &s;laves attended us with the fine&s;t linen: we afterwards &s;at down to a table, covered with provi&s;ions, &s;erved up in china; and drank of a palm wine called Taray, extremely delicious.</P>
<P>At the end of our repa&s;t, my ho&s;t &s;aid, I will tru&s;t you with a &s;ecret that &s;hall convince you of my great kindne&s;s for you. I am in five days time to go from the port of Surat to an i&s;land which I vi&s;it every year, and you &s;hall go along with me. In that i&s;land, which is uninhabitable, for it is full of tigers, there are two hundred pits that produce pearls of an extraordinary &s;ize. This is only known to my|&s;elf. The captain of a ve&s;&s;el, to whom I was once a
<PB N="135" REF="144">
favourite &s;lave, di&s;covered this trea&s;ure to me, and informed me how I &s;hould approach the&s;e pits in &s;pite of the wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Certainly, &s;aid I, the captain did well in teaching you this &s;ecret, for the tigers are likely to give but an ill reception to &s;trangers. It is ea&s;y, replied he, to drive away the mo&s;t furious. We mu&s;t go a&s;hore in the night with lighted torches; the &s;ight of fire frights them, and will make them fly from us. We will go then, and take from tho&s;e precious &s;ources a large quantity of pearl, and &s;ell it at our return into this city: the money we &s;hall get, added to what I have already hoarded, will make a con&s;ider|able fortune for you after my death.</P>
<P>To convince me of the truth of what he &s;aid, he took me into his clo&s;et, and &s;hewed roupees of gold and &s;ilver, lying in prodigious quantities. Well, &s;aid he, does this appear worth your attention? Have you any di&s;like to the voyage? I an&s;wered, I had not; but begged leave to write to my father of my arrival at Surat, and the rea&s;ons which detained me. My ho&s;t con&s;ented, and undertook that it &s;hould be delivered to my father.</P>
<P>I tru&s;ted my letter to the care of Hyzoum, which was the Gentile's name, and we embarked at the port of Surat: we &s;et &s;ail, and after having been three weeks at &s;ea, without any accident, we &s;aw the little de&s;art i&s;land, which my friend told me was that where our bu&s;ine&s;s lay; we moored there, and wait|ed for night that we might land. Hyzoum ordered his
<PB N="136" REF="145">
&s;ailors to remain aboard, and advanced into the i&s;le with no body but my&s;elf. We had each of us a lighted torch, with a number of them under our arms, and bags to put the pearl in. We looked for the pits, by the light of our torches, and we had not &s;earched long before we di&s;covered one of the deep|e&s;t. De&s;cend, my &s;on, &s;aid he; I doubt not but here are fine pearls. I de&s;cended by a rope, which he held, and felt pearl under my feet. I filled the bag; the old man pulled it up, opened the &s;hells, but could find nothing in them but pearl &s;eed; he returned the bag again, and &s;aid, The pearls of this pit are not yet in a condition to be taken. Cover them with earth, which will make them grow, and next year we will come and take them.</P>
<P>He drew me up by the rope, and we went to ano|ther pit, in a large mountain that ro&s;e in the mid&s;t of the i&s;land. The &s;hells here were &s;ingularly beau|tiful. I filled the bag &s;everal times, which the old man drew up, and emptied. Then turning to me, laughing, &s;aid, "Farewel, young man, I thank you for the good &s;ervices you have done me."&mdash;O fa|ther, an&s;wered I, take me from hence&mdash;Thou art very well where thou art, replied the traitor; lie down upon the pearls, and take thy re&s;t. I bring hither every year a young Mu&s;&s;ulman like thee. Thou ha&s;t nothing to do but to pray to thy prophet. If he be able to work miracles, as thou imagine&s;t, he will not for&s;ake a man &s;o zealous, and &s;o &s;trict to his religion. He &s;poke the&s;e words, and left me mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146">O wretched Aboulfaouaris, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, to what misfortunes hath Heaven condemned thee? What ha&s;t thou done to de&s;erve this cruel fate? But why do I complain of a misfortune I have brought upon my&s;elf? Ought not I to have di&s;tru&s;t|ed a perfidious idolater? His exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s! ought I not to have &s;u&s;pected it? But O unprofi|table regret! What avails it now to blame my&s;elf for a fault which I am going too dearly to pay for, and which it depended not on me to avoid? Alas! it was my fate to fall into this aby&s;s, and the &s;ame power which brought me in, can take me out again.</P>
<P>This reflexion &s;uffered me not to give way to de|&s;pair. I pa&s;&s;ed the night in running about the bot|tom of the pit, which &s;eemed of va&s;t extent. I found my&s;elf treading upon bones, and I gue&s;&s;ed that others had peri&s;hed mi&s;erably in this precipice. The thought, however, did not di&s;courage me. Supported by our great prophet, who undoubtedly in&s;pired me, I advanced boldly to an aperture, whence i&s;&s;ued a frightful noi&s;e. I &s;topt to hearken, and, li&s;tening with an attentive ear, thought I un|der&s;tood the cau&s;e of the noi&s;e. I was not deceived in my conjecture: it was the fall of &s;everal waters from the &s;ea, which penetrating into the mountain by divers clefts, met together in this place. I con|cluded from thence that they communicated with the &s;ea by &s;ome large &s;tream, by which I might pa&s;s. I threw my&s;elf in, and, almo&s;t &s;uffocated, the waters took away my &s;en&s;es, dragged me along with them,
<PB N="138" REF="147">
and ca&s;t me on the &s;ea-coa&s;t by a crevice that was in the mountain.</P>
<P>When I regained my &s;en&s;es, and perceived the place through which the waters had brought me out to day-light, I pro&s;trated my&s;elf on the &s;hore, to thank Heaven for my deliverance, and addre&s;&s;ed Mahomet in the&s;e terms: "O Prophet of the Faith|ful, Favourite of the Mo&s;t High, I have more need than ever of thy a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To what purpo&s;e ha&s;t thou delivered me from the deep aby&s;s into which I was ca&s;t, if I am to be left a prey to the wild bea&s;ts of this i&s;land, or if hunger mu&s;t put an end to my life?"</P>
<P>Full of faith, after this prayer, I aro&s;e and walked about the i&s;land, but &s;aw nothing of Hyzoum's &s;hip; that traitor had &s;oon &s;et &s;ail. Though I was not with|out fear that the tigers would devour me, I yet &s;aw none; but &s;oon perceived a large ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ing near the i&s;land, and unfolded the linen of my turban to make a &s;ignal for them to come to me. Tho&s;e on the deck ob&s;erved me, &s;ent out a boat, and I was taken aboard.</P>
<P>Judge of my joy, when I found in the captain of the &s;hip an intimate friend of my father's, and &s;aw by the dre&s;s of the crew that they were all inhabi|tants of Ba&s;ra. I related to them the adventure that brought me to the i&s;land, and they heard me attention. They uttered a thou&s;and imprecations again&s;t the old man, and I a&s;ked the captain after my father, and about matters that related to my family.
<PB N="139" REF="148">
After this our di&s;cour&s;e fell again on the traitor Hyzoum, when the &s;hip's company were de&s;irous of making a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land to &s;earch the pits. We were too many to fear the tigers, we had no need of lighted torches; and if my perfi|dious old fellow took that precaution, it was be|cau&s;e he would have no body partake with him in the pearls. We then ca&s;t anchor, and went a&s;hore, without waiting for the night. Armed with darts and &s;abres, to defend our&s;elves from the wild bea&s;ts, we de&s;cended by turns into the pits, where we found pearls in abundance. Innumerable was the quan|tity of &s;hells we took up. It employed three days compleat to open them, and to divide the pearls; and there fell &s;o much to every one's &s;hare, that all were &s;atisfied.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear, among the ea&s;tern nations there is a perfect freedom of divorce, on condition that the hu&s;band returns the wife to her family, with her portion entire: and as people there, as well as here, &s;ometimes fall out, and are afterwards &s;orry for it, ha&s;ty divorces occa&s;ionally take place: but in order to prevent the abu&s;e that might ari&s;e from the ca|prices of whim or pa&s;&s;ion, the laws will not permit a man to take a woman again whom he has repu|diated, unle&s;s &s;he is fir&s;t married, and then divorced by another. When, therefore, a hu&s;band repents of his ra&s;hne&s;s, in putting away his wife, he prevails on a friend, or hires a needy per&s;on, to marry the woman, and divorce her the next day, which per&s;on is called a hulla. Let us return to our traveller.</P>

<HEAD>The ADVENTURES of ABOULFAOUARIS. PART III.</HEAD>
<P>We now &s;et &s;ail for Serendib to &s;ell our painted callicoes of Surat, and buy cinnamon. We were &s;ailing merrily, when all of a &s;udden a furious tem|pe&s;t aro&s;e, which drove us out of our cour&s;e, we
<PB N="141" REF="150">
knew not whither, for &s;ix days together. On the &s;eventh the &s;ky was clear, but neither pilot nor cap|tain could tell where we were. We knew not what to think, or what to do; and, in &s;pite of all our endeavours, the ve&s;&s;el was drawn by violence towards a mountain, which we di&s;covered on the eighth day.</P>
<P>This mountain was of great extent, and prodi|gious height; very &s;teep, and, what &s;trangely &s;ur|pri&s;ed us, bright and &s;hining like poli&s;hed &s;teel. An old &s;ailor, with a profound &s;igh, cried out, "We are lo&s;t! I have formerly heard talk of this place. It is fatal to all &s;hips that come near it; &s;o that if once you arrive at the foot of the mountain, you are detained there as by a charm; and are never more able to &s;tand out to &s;ea, or to get away from it."</P>
<P>At this relation of the old mariner, the whole crew were immoderately afflicted. Alas! &s;ays one, what are we the better for having found the pearls, if we mu&s;t lo&s;e them and our lives too? Why, &s;ays another, could none among us know the danger we were in? A third made the air echo with his com|plaints and lamentations; and a fourth, falling upon his knees; implored the Prophet's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, touched more with the affliction with which they were all &s;eized, than at the dangers that threatened us, I &s;aid to the captain, "Why &s;hould we, &s;ir, thus cowardly &s;ubmit to &s;orrow? rather let us &s;eek &s;ome means to extricate our&s;elves out of this dif|ficulty. As for me, I have naturally courage. Whe|ther
<PB N="142" REF="151">
Mahomet may have this moment in&s;pired me or not, I am no ways di&s;mayed at the condition to which we are reduced. As &s;oon as we arrive at the foot of the mountain, let us endeavour to gain the top of it. Mounting together, we may perhaps find a recompence for our misfortunes.</P>
<P>The captain, who was not the lea&s;t fearful among us, an&s;wered, that he would, in complai&s;ance, do what was propo&s;ed; but that he had no hopes that we &s;hould &s;ave our&s;elves. Mean while our ve&s;&s;el arrived at the foot of the mountain: the captain and I threw our&s;elves into the boat; we gained the land, began to climb the hill, and, not without difficulty, got to the top.</P>
<P>Here, with &s;urpri&s;e, we &s;aw a green dome, large and high: upon it a column of &s;teel; towards the bottom of which was hung in chains of gold, a &s;mall drum made of aloe-wood, and a crooked &s;tick. Above the drum hung a &s;quare piece of ebony, upon which were the&s;e words, written in letters of gold: "If any &s;hip is &s;o unfortunate as to be drawn to this mountain, &s;he can never put to &s;ea again, except after the following manner. One man of the &s;hip's company mu&s;t give three &s;trokes with the crooked &s;tick upon the drum. At the fir&s;t &s;troke, the &s;hip will get a bow-&s;hot di&s;tance from the mountain: at the &s;econd, &s;he will be out of &s;ight; and at the third, will be found in the very route &s;he &s;hould be in; but the man who &s;trikes the drum, mu&s;t voluntarily re|main behind, and con&s;ent to let the re&s;t be gone."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="152">When we had read this in&s;cription, which ap|peared to us a tali&s;man, we returned aboard to in|form the crew of our di&s;covery. Every one was ravi&s;hed to know that there was a way for deliver|ance; but no body would be the victim. The meane&s;t &s;ailor refu&s;ed to &s;acrifice him&s;elf for the re&s;t. Well then, &s;aid I, I will remain here; I am willing to be an offering for you all, provided you will promi&s;e me, that when you get from hence you will go to Ba&s;ra; that you will tell my father the news, and faithfully deliver into his hands all the pearls which have fallen to my lot.</P>
<P>At this di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;olemnly be&s;eeched Heaven to &s;hipwreck them, if they punctually performed not what I de&s;ired of them. The captain a&s;&s;ured me, as well as the re&s;t, that if I had the re&s;olution to &s;tay behind, they would return to Ba&s;ra without going to Ceylon. He expre&s;&s;ed al&s;o &s;ome concern at lo&s;ing me; but I could ea&s;ily perceive he was glad to get out of danger. In &s;hort, I embraced the crew, and bade them all a long farewel. They &s;et me a&s;hore, and I a&s;cended alone to the top of the mountain. Advancing towards the dome, I took the crooked &s;tick in my hand, &s;truck the drum, and our ve&s;&s;el departed from the mountain. I &s;truck again, and at the &s;econd &s;troke I lo&s;t &s;ight of her. I &s;truck the third time; and then remained under the dome ready to con&s;ummate my &s;acrifice, and un|dergo the fate re&s;erved for me.</P>
<P>I failed not again to addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Pro|phet, and, &s;ecure in his protection, advanced boldly
<PB N="144" REF="153">
into the mountain, which was above two leagues in extent. After an hour's travel, I perceived a de|crepit old man. He had a bald head, a long white beard, and hollow eyes. He &s;eemed to be drawing his la&s;t breath, was &s;itting upon a &s;tone at the door of a little hou&s;e, and had a &s;hort &s;tick in his hand. I &s;aluted him re&s;pectfully, and a&s;ked him to tell me, why the ve&s;&s;els which pa&s;&s;ed at a certain di&s;tance from the mountain were drawn to it in &s;pite of them&s;elves; and who the author of the ta|li&s;man was, by virtue of which they were carried to &s;ea again.</P>
<P>The old man rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, and returned my &s;alute, leaning upon his &s;taff, while his head &s;hook with weakne&s;s. He told me, that the &s;hips were drawn towards the mountain by the force of the currents: that, as to the tali&s;man, which con&s;i&s;ted in the drum, he knew not who made it; but if I were curious to know the my&s;tery, I mu&s;t continue my road, and that I &s;hould meet his brother, who was much older than he, and who could give me &s;ome light into the matter. I pre&s;ently took leave of him, and found indeed a &s;econd old man, but he appeared to be more vigorous; for he had only begun to grow grey, and one would have thought him rather the &s;on than the &s;enior brother of the other. I a&s;ked him, as I had done the fir&s;t, if he knew who it was that had made the tali&s;man. No, replied he, I know not who it was; if any one can tell you, it is undoubtedly my elder brother, whom you will find on the road a little further.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="154">I continued to march on, and pre&s;ently perceived a man digging. He had not a grey hair on his head, and appeared much too &s;trong to be older than the other two I had &s;een before. Father, &s;aid I, I have met with two old men who have bantered me. I de&s;ired them to tell me who was the author of the tali&s;man on the mountain. They &s;aid they knew not, but that they had an elder brother who could inform me. The old man &s;miled at the&s;e words, and an&s;wered, my &s;on, they told you the truth, they are both younger than I am.</P>
<P>If this an&s;wer of the third old man &s;urpri&s;ed me, that which he added &s;till increa&s;ed my wonder. They call us, &s;aid he, the three old men of the mountain: the fir&s;t that you met is much the younge&s;t; he is not above fifty years old. The rea&s;on of his being &s;o worn out and decrepit is, becau&s;e he had a bad wife and children, who gave him a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s. The &s;econd is &s;eventy-five, and he is ruddier and &s;tronger than the other, becau&s;e he had a good wife, and no children: as for me, I am more vigorous than my brothers, though I am pa&s;t a hundred, becau&s;e I would never marry.</P>
<P>As to the tali&s;man, pur&s;ued he, the author of which you de&s;ire to know, I have heard it &s;aid in my youth, that it was compo&s;ed by a great Indian ca|bali&s;t, and that is all that I know of it. I a&s;ked him afterwards, if I was near any country inhabited. Yes, an&s;wered he, you need but follow the road
<PB N="146" REF="155">
which you are in, and you will pre&s;ently come to a va&s;t plain, which bounds another mountain, at the foot of which there are two paths, one on the right, and the other on the left hand. Follow the former; it will lead you to a great city, which hath a very fine port. Take care not to follow the left hand path, for that will carry you into a wood, where dwell very wicked men, the de&s;cendants of a mon&s;trous race of giants: they are cannibals, and have women who come to the confines of their territories, and endeavour to entice all pa&s;&s;engers by their arts and blandi&s;hments to follow them into their country.</P>
<P>I thanked the old man for the information he gave me, and was re&s;olved not to neglect his cautions. When I had cro&s;&s;ed the plain, I took the road on the right hand, and it brought me, as he &s;aid, to a very large city, well peopled. The &s;treets and the hou&s;es were beautiful, and the port full of &s;hipping. I gue&s;&s;ed there mu&s;t be a great trade, and I was not deceived. I &s;aw &s;hips that came from the kingdom of Canara and Vi&s;apour loaded with pepper; others filled with the &s;pices of Cananor, and &s;ome with cinnamon. I &s;aw merchants of all countries. As I was bu&s;y in ob&s;erving the port, a man came up to me. We looked upon and knew one another. It was Habib, my father's corre&s;pondent at Serendib. After we had embraced &s;everal times, Who would have thought, cried he, that I &s;hould have met Aboulfaouaris here? What fatal adventure forced
<PB N="147" REF="156">
you to leave Serendib without bidding me farewel, without giving me notice of your departure; and by what unexpected good fortune are you re&s;tored to me?</P>
<P>I told him my adventure with Canzada, and what had happened to me &s;ince. On his &s;ide, he inform|ed me, that he had a &s;hip in the port; that he was come to &s;ell cinnamon, that he had di&s;po&s;ed of his cargo, and that in twenty-four hours he hoped to be gone. I expre&s;&s;ed to him the joy I had to find him again. He conducted me on board his &s;hip, and the &s;ame day we &s;et &s;ail for Serendib. I was over|joyed to return thither, and you may think that Canzada was the principal cau&s;e of the plea|&s;ure that I conceived to my&s;elf of &s;eeing that city again. We arrived after a &s;hort voyage, becau&s;e we had all along a favourable wind.</P>
<P>I was very impatient to learn news of Canzada, whom I could not forbear loving, though I had no great rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the treatment &s;he had given me. I went out one morning from Habib's, with a de&s;ign to &s;pare no pains to get what intel|ligence I could of her, when a kind of &s;lave &s;topped me in the &s;treet; Sir, &s;aid he to me, do you remem|ber me? No, an&s;wered I, but yet your face is not altogether unknown to me; I have a confu&s;ed idea of having &s;een you, but cannot &s;ay where. I know you well, replied he, you are a Mu&s;&s;ulman; you are called Aboulfaouaris; I had the honour to wait on you during your abode with the prince&s;s Canzada,
<PB N="148" REF="157">
to whom I was, and &s;till am, a &s;lave. It was I that by her order went to find out your ma&s;ter De|haou&s;ch, into who&s;e hands you were delivered. I was &s;orry to be put upon that office, and I beg you would believe I was.</P>
<P>My heart leaped with joy at the &s;lave's di&s;cour&s;e. My dear friend, &s;aid I to him, making him accept of a diamond ring, inform me, I conjure you, in what condition is the prince&s;s, who is always dear to me, in &s;pite of her rigours: Is &s;he in the &s;ame &s;tate in which I left her? No, &s;ir, replied the &s;lave, her affairs are much altered within the&s;e two months: the king of Ceylon made her e&s;pou&s;e an old lord of the court, who was in love with her. She could not help obeying; &s;he is married.</P>
<P>The grief I expre&s;&s;ed at this news was &s;o &s;evere, that the &s;lave appeared touched at it. I am &s;orry, &s;aid he, that the marriage of my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould give you &s;o much trouble: It is your own fault; why would you not renounce your Prophet? You would then at this time have enjoyed the fine&s;t woman in the world, and an immen&s;e trea&s;ure. Had I been in your place, I would not have taken &s;o much time to con&s;ider as you did: the fir&s;t day, the fir&s;t hour, the fir&s;t minute, I would have determined to do what|ever Canzada had de&s;ired me. From how much affliction might you have exempted both your&s;elf and her! For after your departure &s;he fell &s;ick, and had like to have lo&s;t her life.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="158">I know not, continued he, whether I &s;hould tell her, that you are come to Serendib; I fear it will renew the grief which &s;he &s;o long cheri&s;hed, and which is not yet di&s;pelled. On the other &s;ide, I &s;ee you &s;o much afflicted, that I cannot re&s;olve to deprive you of all con&s;olation. I promi&s;e you then, that this day my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hall know that I have &s;een you. One of her women &s;hall tell her, that you repent of your pa&s;t conduct, and that if you could make amends for it, you would not he&s;itate a moment at renouncing Mahomet's doctrine for her &s;ake. No, no, cried I, take care that you promi&s;e nothing that I ought not to do, though it were in my power to obtain the prince&s;s at the price. Tell her only that I am in de&s;pair for having lo&s;t her, and to un|der&s;tand that &s;he is di&s;contented with her condi|tion.</P>
<P>The &s;lave &s;wore, that he would exactly perform the commi&s;&s;ion I charged him with; then left me, and I remained in a &s;tate of mind equally mixed with joy and grief. If the change of Canzada's condition afflicted me, I felt &s;ome joy when I came to think that &s;he might &s;till perhaps have &s;ome af|fection for me. Flattered with &s;o agreeable an idea, I waited every day for the &s;lave's coming to in|quire for me at Habib's, where I had told him I lodged; but my expectation was vain; one entire month pa&s;&s;ed, and I heard no news of Canzada.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="159">I gue&s;&s;ed then that the &s;lave had made a wrong judgment of his mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;entiments; that the lord &s;he had married was beloved by her; or, in &s;hort, that the lady's virtue had triumphed over the incli|nation &s;he had for me. Full of this la&s;t thought, which I had the vanity to think well grounded, I re|tired to a fine country-hou&s;e which my father's cor|re&s;pondent had, three quarters of a league from the city of Serendib.</P>
<P>I employed my time in walking, or, more pro|perly, in mu&s;ing as I walked, on the object that in|flamed me. One day I was got in&s;en&s;ibly a good way from Habib's hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ing along the river-&s;ide, came to a magnificent pagod, which was built on the bank. After having admired the &s;tructure, I &s;uddenly gave attention to what &s;eemed very de&s;erving of it. I &s;aw &s;everal Gentoo prie&s;ts, who were erecting a &s;ort of hut with reeds, and other combu&s;tible matters. I went and a&s;ked what they were doing. One, among&s;t the re&s;t, an&s;wered; certainly you have not been long at Serendib, or you would not a&s;k me this que&s;tion. Are you &s;uch a &s;tranger to the cu&s;tom of the Gentoos, as not to know that this is the place appointed for fune|rals? It is here that we burn dead bodies; here that the wives, &s;acrificing them&s;elves to the manes of their hu&s;bands, acquire immortal glory. One of the principal lords of the court of Serendib is dead, his body is to be burnt on the river's &s;ide five or &s;ix hours hence, and his faithful &s;pou&s;e will be con|&s;umed
<PB N="151" REF="160">
in the very flames which are to reduce him to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Having never &s;een this ceremony, I re&s;olved to be a witne&s;s of it. I could not help deploring the bigotry of the&s;e idolaters, who&s;e &s;acrilegious piety con&s;ecrates rage and madne&s;s; or, rather, I laid the blame on their prie&s;ts, of whom I had heard much at Surat. This horrible cu&s;tom is continued among&s;t the Gentoos.</P>
<P>Near the hour that this dete&s;table execution drew nigh, the fields were filled with people; &s;ome on foot, &s;ome on hor&s;eback, and others on palanquins, and preceded by &s;laves, carrying &s;tandards, or blow|ing the trumpet. The governor of Serendib was mounted on an elephant, in the mid&s;t of ten or twelve per&s;ons, &s;itting under a tent, which was rai&s;ed on the back of the animal. In two or three hours, there were above thirty thou&s;and per&s;ons about the pagod and the hut. Not willing to let any circum&s;tance of this ceremony e&s;cape my cu|rio&s;ity, I pierced the croud, and got as near the fu|neral pile as it was po&s;&s;ible. Twenty prie&s;ts, who had each of them a book, began all to pray while in waiting for the victim.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t night when &s;he arrived. She was mounted on a white hor&s;e richly capari&s;oned, crown|ed with flowers, and followed the corp&s;e of her hu&s;|band, which &s;ix men carried on a &s;tately palanquin. Twelve women, adorned with jewels, bracelets, and great rings of gold and &s;ilver, attended her;
<PB N="152" REF="161">
they had all long hair, with necklaces of pearl, fine pendants in their ears, and crowns of gold, with plates of &s;ilver enriched by rubies, which covered one half of the face. Mu&s;icians followed the women &s;laves. Her parents and friends came next &s;inging and dancing, to &s;hew their felicity in having, &s;ome for a relation and others for their friend, &s;o generous a woman.</P>
<P>With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two prie&s;ts &s;he di&s;mounted, and was conducted to the banks of the river, where the body of her hu&s;band was brought; &s;he wa&s;hed it from head to foot; and then delivered it to the prie&s;ts, who carried it into the hut upon a &s;traw mat covered with &s;ulphur. She ro&s;e up, without undre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, went near to the pile, walked &s;everal times round it, and beheld the preparations that were making for her &s;acrifice with great intre|pidity. She embraced her parents and friends, who pre&s;ently retired; &s;he was embraced by her women &s;laves, di&s;&s;olved in tears; to whom &s;he gave liberty, and di&s;tributed the jewels and ornaments with which &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed. When &s;he took off the &s;ilver plate, which covered half her face, and which, till then, had hindered me from knowing her, gue&s;s at my a&s;toni&s;hment, when I di&s;covered Canzada. All na|ture rever&s;ed at once, could not have more &s;urpri&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Great God! &s;aid I to my&s;elf, can I believe my eyes? May I not doubt of what I &s;ee? Is it really Canzada who is going to &s;uffer &s;o cruel a death?
<PB N="153" REF="162">
The grief I was in, would not &s;uffer me to &s;ee the &s;acrifice performed; I left her in the hands of the prie&s;t, who having exhorted her to render her&s;elf worthy, by her con&s;tancy, of the happine&s;s that at|tended her, they put her into the hut, and pre&s;ented to her, according to cu&s;tom, a lighted torch, to &s;et fire to it her&s;elf. I flew towards Habib's country-hou&s;e, in a di&s;po&s;ition of mind not to be de&s;cribed. Di&s;turbed, forlorn, I knew not what I did; I turned every moment my eyes towards the place of cere|mony, and the flames of the pile which I &s;aw ri&s;ing in the air, rent my heart a&s;under.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I arrived there: he a&s;ked the cau&s;e of the di&s;order which appeared in me: I told it him, and my generous friend an&s;wered me tear for tear. I am &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;aid he, that Canzada would peri&s;h to follow an old lord, whom &s;he did not love. Why, &s;aid I, was it then in her power to have &s;urvived him? Are not the wives here obliged to burn them&s;elves with the bodies of their hu&s;bands? No, replied Ha|bib, they are not con&s;trained to &s;acrifice them&s;elves: on the contrary, the governor of the city, by the king's order, cau&s;es the widows that &s;eek this death to come before him: he interrogates them upon the rea&s;ons of &s;o fatal a de&s;ign, and endeavours to per&s;uade them to de&s;i&s;t from it. In &s;hort, he grants them leave to die, only when they ab&s;olutely demand it of him.</P>
<P>Canzada, pur&s;ued he, was very willing to die, per&s;uaded, as all women are, who &s;acrifice them|&s;elves,
<PB N="154" REF="163">
that &s;he &s;hould procure to her&s;elf, by a glo|rious and voluntary death, an eternal happine&s;s. Be|&s;ides, &s;he may have been urged on, by the honours that are paid to tho&s;e mi&s;erable victims after their death; for their memories here are held in venera|tion; even &s;tatues are erected to them among tho&s;e of the pagods. In a word, they are regarded as deities; and this, no doubt, is what in&s;pires our women who demand death, with that fortitude which makes them look upon the preparation of their &s;a|crifice without changing colour.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections of Habib rai&s;ed others in me. I repre&s;ented to my&s;elf, that if Canzada had loved me as much as I loved her, &s;he would not have been &s;o ready to de&s;troy her&s;elf; that &s;he would have made me the propo&s;al, that if I would marry her on conditions which I had rejected, &s;he would not &s;acrifice hre&s;elf; that &s;he ought to have put me to this proof, which undoubtedly, however, would have very much perplexed me.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I to Habib, whatever rea&s;ons I have to forget Canzada, I de&s;pair of ever doing it; I cannot &s;tay at Serendib after what has happened, give me leave to return to Ba&s;ra. My ho&s;t con&s;ented; we returned to Serendib the next morning, and the fir&s;t thing I did was to inquire for a &s;hip that was to go from thence to any part of India: I was informed that one of Surat, laden with callicoes, was ju&s;t ar|rived in the port, and that her cargo would &s;oon be old off. I re&s;olved to make u&s;e of this opportunity,
<PB N="155" REF="164">
and waiting for the day of my departure, I led a very melancholy life with Habib. Whatever care my friend took to overcome my di&s;tre&s;s, he could not conquer it; he &s;pared nothing to compa&s;s his end; not a day pa&s;&s;ed, in which he did not find out &s;ome new diver&s;ion, and every meal we ate he accompanied with dancing and concerts.</P>
<P>One day as I was &s;itting thus in mi&s;ery, a &s;lave came to &s;peak with me in private. He was the &s;ame that I met on my arival here, who had made me fair promi&s;es, which he had not performed. Sir, &s;aid he, I prote&s;t it is not my fault that you have not &s;een me &s;ooner; my mi&s;tre&s;s forbad me to &s;peak to you again, and I dared not di&s;obey her. She was a prince&s;s of heroic virtue, and would have no fur|ther to &s;ay to you: not content to be faithful to a hu&s;band &s;he did not love, &s;he gave her&s;elf to the flames, to gain the veneration of the Gentoos: but let us leave her to the enjoyment of a happine&s;s &s;he dearly bought, and come to the bu&s;ine&s;s that has brought me hither. I am, at pre&s;ent, a &s;lave to another lady, not le&s;s fair than Canzada, and who loves you more: I under&s;tand you are upon the point of embarking for Surat; but before your de|parture, I would advi&s;e you to make u&s;e of the good fortune that pre&s;ents it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was more &s;urpri&s;ed than plea&s;ed at the &s;lave's di&s;cour&s;e. Friend, &s;aid I, it is with grief that I find my&s;elf reduced to be ungrateful to the favourable &s;entiments your new mi&s;tre&s;s hath conceived for me:
<PB N="156" REF="165">
the image of Canzada is always in my thoughts, and leaves me little reli&s;h for new adventures. The lady whom you &s;erve mu&s;t pardon me, if I refu&s;e her favours. Having never &s;een her, my indifference can be no offence.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, replied the &s;lave, that I am not fortunate in my negotiations; I am certain, however, you would be charmed with her, whatever obligations you may have had to Canzada. You are mi&s;taken, &s;aid I, you are u&s;ed to judge wrong of the emotions of the heart; you imagined that your former mi&s;tre&s;s loved me &s;till, and de&s;ired nothing more than my arrival at Serendib. You are in the right to reproach me thus, &s;aid the &s;lave; but upon this occa&s;ion, be a&s;&s;ured that I am certain of what I advance; give me leave only to come for you this night, and take you to the place appointed. No, &s;aid I, no, I cannot prevail with my&s;elf to believe you; I know women too well, to put her upon trial. What a vexation would &s;he be in, &s;hould &s;he find that I cannot love her. In vain did the &s;lave a&s;&s;ure me &s;he would hearken to rea&s;on, and not impute to me as a crime my con&s;tancy to Canzada. I refu&s;ed to &s;ee her: and per&s;uaded my|&s;elf I &s;hould hear no more either of the &s;lave or the lady; but he found me out again at night, and brought me a letter, which contained the &s;ub|&s;tance of what follows: "The conver&s;ation you have had with my &s;lave, gives me plea&s;ure; it in|crea&s;es the impatience I had to &s;ee to you; and if
<PB N="157" REF="166">
you be &s;o really concerned about Canzada as you ap|pear to be, both you and I &s;hall pre&s;ently be better &s;atisfied with each other."</P>
<P>This my&s;terious language gave me room for much &s;peculation. I could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire I had of clearing up the matter: I followed the &s;lave, who conducted me to a &s;mall hou&s;e, and led me into a very plain lodging, where he left me, &s;aying, he would acquaint the lady I was there. I did not wait long for her&mdash;&s;he came&mdash;but oh! think what confu&s;ion I was in, when I beheld the Prince&s;s Can|zada her&s;elf, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be reduced to a&s;hes!</P>
<P>Aboulfaouaris's auditors &s;tood amazed: He per|ceived it, &s;miled, and continued his relation.</P>
<P>I believed it, at fir&s;t, to be an apparition. The features of a woman, the mo&s;t dear to me in the world, put me in as great di&s;may, as a real &s;pectre could have produced; &s;he ob&s;erved my confu&s;ion, and could not forbear laughing. Aboulfaouaris, &s;aid &s;he, 'twas not to frighten you that I de&s;ired to &s;ee you; 'tis not Canzada's &s;hade you &s;ee, 'tis &s;he her&s;elf: Your &s;urpri&s;e indeed has &s;ome foundation. We cannot di&s;cover on a &s;udden, a per&s;on whom we believed to be dead, without much emotion; but I will di&s;pel your fear, by convincing you that I yet live.</P>
<P>She then told me, that &s;he had bribed the Chief Prie&s;t, and in what manner that pious per&s;on had &s;aved her from the flames, for a con&s;iderable &s;um of
<PB N="158" REF="167">
money. He cau&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age to be made privately under ground by the other prie&s;ts, whom he entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret. The funeral pile was erected over that &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;age, into which, &s;aid &s;he, I de&s;cended, after having &s;et fire to the reeds that con&s;umed nothing but my hu&s;band's body. The night being come, and the &s;pectators retired, the Chief Prie&s;t him&s;elf conducted me to this hou&s;e that I had hired before-hand.</P>
<P>But, my Prince&s;s, &s;aid I, why deceive the people by a pretended death? Why feign to follow your aged hu&s;band? They forced you not to die with him; you might have &s;pared that di&s;&s;imulation. No, replied the lady, I found my&s;elf under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of doing what I have done; you will be con|vinced of this truth, when I tell you that I have a de&s;ign to join my fate to your's, to abjure idolatry, and to go to Ba&s;ra with you, and profe&s;s the reli|gion of Mahomet. It mu&s;t have been your prophet him&s;elf that in&s;pired me with this great enterpri&s;e. My relations now believing me dead, I can without fear leave Serendib, and unite my lot to your's. This was the motive that urged me to an action, that not only amazes you, but, without doubt, a&s;to|ni&s;hes the world; for they well know, that I never loved the old Lord whom I married in obedience to the King. They imagine that the vanity of pa&s;&s;ing for a heroine, and having a &s;tatue among the pagods, induced me to die with my hu&s;band; but rea&s;on, or perhaps my love for you, made me reflect maturely on &s;o &s;uper&s;titious a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="168">And is it then, my Queen, &s;aid I, in favour of Aboulfaouaris, that you have employed this inge|nious &s;tratagem? Was it to live with me, that you re&s;olved to go from Ceylon? Is it to crown me with joy that you re&s;olve to follow the doctrine of our great prophet? Oh beautiful Canzada! at this mo|ment you make me the happie&s;t of men.&mdash;I threw my&s;elf at her knees, and embraced them with tran&s;|port. Ri&s;e up, Aboulfaouaris, &s;aid &s;he, I doubt whether you have rea&s;on to boa&s;t &s;o much of your happine&s;s; Canzada is no longer &s;o precious a con|que&s;t: Alas! I am not now mi&s;tre&s;s of all the riches I gave you with my heart: I have given the be&s;t part of them to the prie&s;ts that &s;erved me; and I paid dear to the Governor of Ceylon, for his permi&s;&s;ion to devote my&s;elf to the flames with my decea&s;ed hu&s;band.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, which gave me &s;o fair an occa|&s;ion to declare my love, I looked on her with ten|derne&s;s, and &s;aid, how unju&s;t, my charming Can|zada, are you to &s;u&s;pect me of not having &s;entiments as free from &s;elf-intere&s;t as your own! When in the &s;tately palace, where you detained me, you expo&s;ed your trea&s;ures to my view, I call Heaven to wit|ne&s;s, my heart was &s;et on you alone.</P>
<P>She told me, that my &s;entiments were &s;uch as &s;he de&s;ired; that &s;he was not &s;tript of all, and that &s;he had jewels enough &s;till to make her a fortune, wherewith I &s;hould have rea&s;on to be content. She &s;poke of the mi&s;chiefs &s;he had occa&s;ioned me, and
<PB N="160" REF="169">
&s;aid, &s;he had &s;ufficiently atoned for them by her grief. We agreed after this, to go for Ba&s;ra as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I took leave of my landlord, con|ducted her that night to the harbour, and embarked with her, and &s;ome faithful &s;laves who carried her jewels.</P>
<P>We arrived at Surat without the lea&s;t danger, and found there a Ba&s;ra &s;hip that was returning home. We made u&s;e of the occa&s;ion, and, as if Heaven were willing to let us know that it favoured us, we arrived at Ba&s;ra with the mo&s;t fortunate ex|pedition.</P>
<P>No joy could equal that of my father when he &s;aw me again. After our fir&s;t embraces, I pre|&s;ented Canzada to him, who&s;e quality needed no boa&s;t: Her noble air and her beauty confe&s;&s;ed at full what &s;he was. He received her with the highe&s;t tokens of e&s;teem, and conceived for her all the ten|derne&s;s of a father. When he had heard her &s;tory, which I related to him in the terms of a pa&s;&s;ionate lover, I then gave him an account of my travels. He afterwards informed me, that he had received my pearls from the Captain, who had taken charge of them.</P>
<P>My father and I conducted the lady to the Cady, to whom &s;he abjured her idolatrous faith, before many witne&s;&s;es. He then a&s;ked her, if &s;he con|&s;ented that I &s;hould be her hu&s;band? She an&s;wered, that it was the deare&s;t de&s;ire of her heart; and upon that an&s;wer the Judge married us. My father, to
<PB N="161" REF="170">
celebrate our nuptials, invited our relations and friends to a &s;plendid fea&s;t and great rejoicings, which la&s;ted &s;ix days together.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE VII.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>BEFORE we read our long &s;tory ye&s;terday, I told you, children, that the moral mo&s;t con|&s;picuous in it was the value and nece&s;&s;ity of Forti|tude. I &s;hall now take occa&s;ion to continue that &s;ubject, by pointing out to you the beauty and worth of this ine&s;timable virtue. You mu&s;t have patience, if I &s;eem prolix.</P>
<P>That it is the duty of a man to be equal to all fortunes, is a doctrine that cannot be too &s;trongly inculcated: And the rea&s;ons why he &s;hould be &s;o, are &s;o plain, &s;o con&s;picuous, that when I look round, and &s;ee all the world, with very few exceptions, &s;hrinking from the mo&s;t trifling degrees of pain, grieving at in&s;ignificant accidents, and de&s;ponding beneath common misfortunes, I am amazed.</P>
<P>Let us but reflect, that the utmo&s;t malice of fate can do nothing more than deprive us of life, and
<PB N="162" REF="171">
that the longe&s;t life mu&s;t very &s;oon inevitably end; and what will there remain for us to fear? Be&s;ides, if the evils that afflict us be in our own power to re|move, to grieve would be ridiculous, as well as pu&s;illanimous; and if they be not, but are without remedy, to be terrified, or &s;ink under them, is equally &s;o. How many people make their lives mi&s;erable, by a continued round of fal&s;e alarms? Every occurrence in the day is a misfortune. If they cut a finger, they mourn over it; if their head ach, they are going to die; and if the apothecary &s;ends a draught, the ta&s;te is &s;o nau&s;eous, that, after tormenting them&s;elves with irre&s;olute attempts to force it down, they fling it away. At night, when they &s;hould re&s;t from their cares, and enjoy a tem|porary death, the reality of which appears horrible, they cannot &s;leep, for the dread of thieves or fire; never con&s;idering that it were better to be robbed or &s;uffer almo&s;t any puni&s;hment, than live in the fear of that puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Oh! my children, I would have you de&s;pi&s;e the pu&s;illanimity that would di&s;compo&s;e a feature while you &s;wallow a potion, or &s;tretch forth a limb to have a wound dre&s;&s;ed. Be a&s;&s;ured, that pain de|crea&s;es in proportion as it is defied, and becomes horrible as the fear of it is indulged; and remember likewi&s;e, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be happy, much le&s;s magnanimous, till you are ma&s;ters of your own fate, till you can behave with equanimity under all fortunes; that is, till you are &s;uperior to fear.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="172">It is only tho&s;e opportunities where the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fortitude is apparent, that di&s;cover the truly great man. What a noble, what a &s;uperior magnanimity, did Fabricius &s;hew before Pyrrhus! The command he had obtained over him&s;elf, his un&s;haken &s;teadi|ne&s;s, and the reliance he could place on it, was &s;o great, that it was a&s;toni&s;hing. He was &s;ent Am|ba&s;&s;ador from the Romans, to treat with Pyrrhus concerning the ran&s;om, or exchange, of pri&s;oners. At their fir&s;t interview, Pyrrhus, who had heard, from Cineas, a great character of Fabricius, pre&s;t him to receive a valuable pre&s;ent in gold; not with a view to engage him in any thing di&s;hondurable, but as a pledge of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality. This he peremptorily refu&s;ed. The next day, Pyrrhus had a mind to make another e&s;&s;ay on him, by endeavour|ing to a&s;toni&s;h, or rather to terrify him. He knew Fabricius had never &s;een an elephant; he com|manded, therefore, one of the large&s;t, compleatly armed, to be placed behind &s;ome curtains in the room where they were to confer. Upon a &s;ignal given, the curtains were &s;uddenly drawn, and the elephant rai&s;ing his trunk over the head of Fabri|cius, made a mo&s;t horrid bellowing. The Roman, without the lea&s;t &s;ign of terror or &s;urprize, turned and looked at the bea&s;t; then addre&s;&s;ing Pyrrhus, with a &s;mile, &s;aid, "Sir, neither could your money ye&s;terday, nor your mon&s;ter to-day, make the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on me."</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="173">The year following, when Fabricius was Con&s;ul, and at the head of the army, an unknown per&s;on came to the camp, and delivered him a letter from the King's chief Phy&s;ician, who offered to take off Pyrrhus by poi&s;on, and, in that way, end the war, without farther hazard to the Romans, provided they would give him a reward proportionate to his &s;er|vice. Fabricius, enraged at the villainy of the Phy&s;ician, after bringing the other Con&s;ul to be of the &s;ame opinion, &s;ent di&s;patches to Pyrrhus imme|diately, to warn him of his danger. His letter ran thus:</P>
<P>"Caius Fabricius, and Quintius Emilius, Con|&s;uls of the Romans, to Pyrrhus the King; health."</P>
<P>"You &s;eem to have made a very ill judgment both of your friends and enemies. You will under|&s;tand by the enclo&s;ed letter, which was &s;ent to us, that you are at war with hone&s;t men, and tru&s;t in knaves and villains. We have not di&s;covered this to you to in&s;inuate our&s;elves into your favour, but le&s;t your ruin might bring a reproach upon us; as if we had ended the war by treachery, when we were not able to do it by our courage and our virtue."&mdash; Do not your hearts glow, my children, at heroi&s;m like this? Will you not remember, will you not emulate, &s;uch actions?</P>
<P>I &s;hall cite a few more examples of the dignity of Fortitude, that you may perceive how re&s;pectable, how &s;uperior it makes men, and in what a glorious &s;anctity it pre&s;erves their characters to the late&s;t po&s;|terity.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="174">Caracalla the emperor, that cruel and inexorable tyrant, began his reign by murdering his brother Geta in the arms of his mother, to whom he had fled for refuge. Papinian was at that time a civilian in Rome, of the greate&s;t e&s;timation. To him Cara|calla applied, in order to be vindicated by his writ|ings: but Papinian, di&s;regarding his own life, intre|pidly replied, "It is ea&s;ier to commit a parricide than to ju&s;tify it." For which an&s;wer he was beheaded, it is true; but who does not revere the magnani|mous, the virtuous Papinian, that had the forti|tude to defy death, rather than, by a de&s;picable, a wicked compliance, incur the contemptuous cur&s;e of po&s;terity, only to prolong a &s;hort and ignomi|nious exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>Of all nations, indeed, whether ancient or mo|dern, the Romans appear to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;ublime, unremitted, and &s;tupendous fortitude. Por|&s;enna, when he be&s;ieged Rome, had defeated the Ro|mans, who were flying in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation, and were pur&s;ued by the enemy to the bridge, over which both victors and vanqui&s;hed were about to enter the city in the confu&s;ion. All appeared lo&s;t, when Horatius Cocles, who had been placed there as a centinel, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the torrent of the enemy, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted only by two more, for &s;ome time &s;u&s;tained the whole fury of the a&s;&s;ault, till the bridge was broken down behind him. When he found the communication thus cut off, plunging with his arms into the torrent of the Tiber, he &s;wam
<PB N="166" REF="175">
back victorious to his fellow-&s;oldiers, and was re|ceived, honoured, and rewarded by his countrymen, as the &s;aviour of Rome.</P>
<P>Still, however, Por&s;enna was determined upon taking the city; and though five hundred of his men were &s;lain in a &s;ally of the Romans, he reduced it to the greate&s;t &s;traits, and turning the &s;iege into a blockade, re&s;olved to take it by famine. The di&s;|tre&s;s of the be&s;ieged &s;oon began to be in&s;ufferable, and all things &s;eemed to threaten a &s;peedy &s;urrender, when another act of fortitude and bravery, &s;till &s;u|perior to that which had &s;aved the city before, again promi&s;ed its deliverance.</P>
<P>Mutius, a youth of undaunted courage, was re|&s;olved to rid his country of an enemy that &s;o &s;orely continued to oppre&s;s it; and, for this purpo&s;e, di&s;|gui&s;ed in the habit of an Etrurian pea&s;ant, entered the camp of the enemy, re&s;olving to die, or to kill die king. With this re&s;olution, he made up to the place where Por&s;enna was paying his troops, with the &s;ecretary by his &s;ide: but mi&s;taking the latter for the king, he &s;tabbed him to the heart, and was immediately apprehended and brought into the royal pre&s;ence. Upon Por&s;enna's demanding who he was, and the cau&s;e of &s;o heinous an action, Mutius, with|out re&s;erve, informed him of his country and his de&s;ign, and, at the &s;ame time, thru&s;ting his right hand into the fire burning upon an altar before him, "You &s;ee, cried he, how little I regard the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment your cruelty can inflict upon me, A
<PB N="167" REF="176">
Roman knows not only how to act, but how to &s;uffer. I am not the only per&s;on you have to fear. Three hundred of the Roman youth, like me, have con&s;pired your de&s;truction, therefore prepare for their attempts." Por&s;enna, amazed at &s;o much for|titude, had too noble a mind not to acknowledge merit, though found in an enemy. He therefore ordered him to be &s;afely conducted to Rome, and offered &s;uch conditions of peace, as were accepted.</P>
<P>Modern times likewi&s;e, my children, afford nu|merous examples of heroic virtue and inflexible per|&s;everance in right. I will &s;elect one, and a noble in&s;tance it is, from the hi&s;tory of our own country.</P>
<P>When our great Henry V. was Prince of Wales, he, led a&s;tray by youthful pa&s;&s;ions, a&s;&s;ociated him|&s;elf with the vicious and di&s;&s;olute. One of his &s;er|vants, or rather companions, was apprehended for felony, and brought to the bar of the King's Bench, where the chief ju&s;tice, Ga&s;coign, was then &s;itting. The prince heard of this tran&s;action, and, inflamed by the mi&s;repre&s;entations of his lewd a&s;&s;ociates, flew raging into the court, where his &s;ervant &s;tood ar|raigned, and commanded him to be unfettered and &s;et at liberty. The judge endeavoured to repre&s;&s; this outrage, and appea&s;e the prince, by exhorting him to pay a proper re&s;pect to the ancient and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed laws of the land; and, if he wi&s;hed to ex|empt his &s;ervant from puni&s;hment, to apply to the king, his father, who alone held the power of a legal reprieve. But the prince, indulging his pa&s;&s;ion, in|&s;tead
<PB N="168" REF="177">
of li&s;tening to this very proper remon&s;trance, proceeded to u&s;e force for the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oner. The judge, fore&s;eeing the dangerous con&s;equence of &s;uch a flagrant breach of the con&s;titution, ele|vated his voice, and in a bold authoritative tone, commanded the prince, on his allegiance, to leave the pri&s;oner and depart the place. The prince, inflamed beyond all bounds flew with his drawn &s;word to the judgment-&s;eat, while no one dared to mole&s;t him, though all dreaded the event. The judge alone &s;eemed undi&s;turbed, and &s;uperior to pa&s;&s;ion. Without &s;hrinking, with the &s;ame un|altered countenance, the &s;ame tone of voice, the &s;ame cool, undaunted, but unimpa&s;&s;ioned deport|ment, "Sir, &s;aid he to the prince, recollect your|&s;elf&mdash;I &s;it here the repre&s;entative of the King, your &s;overeign Lord and Father&mdash;In his name I charge you to de&s;i&s;t from your di&s;obedient and unlawful en|terprize&mdash;Learn to give a good example to tho&s;e who &s;hall hereafter become your own &s;ubjects, and for this pre&s;ent contempt and di&s;obedience, go YOU now to the pri&s;on of the King's Bench, whereunto I commit you, until the plea&s;ure of the king, your father, &s;hall be known." The prince, convinced of his enormity, a&s;hamed of his intemperance, and &s;truck with the &s;edate and awful fortitude of the judge, threw down his &s;word, bowed to the magi|&s;trate, and voluntarily went to pri&s;on. "Ble&s;&s;ed be God," &s;aid Henry IV. when he heard of this tran&s;action "Ble&s;&s;ed be God who hath given me a

<P>THE following lines are addre&s;&s;ed to your Highne&s;s, from a man who values his liberty and a very &s;mall fortune, in a remote part of this i&s;land, under the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, above all the riches and honours that he could any where enjoy under any other e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, the doctrines that are lately come into the world, and how far the phra&s;e has obtained, of calling your royal father God's Vicegerent; which ill men have turned both to the di&s;honour of God, and the impeachment of his Maje&s;ty's good|ne&s;s. They adjoin vicegerency to the idea of being all-powerful, and not to that of being all-good. His Maje&s;ty's wi&s;dom, it is to be hoped, will &s;ave him from the &s;nare that may lie under gro&s;s adulations: but your youth, and the thir&s;t of prai&s;e, which I have ob&s;erved in you, may po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;lead you to hearken to tho&s;e charmers who would conduct your noble nature into tyranny.

<P>Your father is called the Vicegerent of heaven: while he is good, he is the vicegerent of heaven. Shall man have authority from the Fountain of good to do evil? No, my prince: let mean and degene|rate &s;pirits, which want benevolence, &s;uppo&s;e your power impaired by a di&s;ability of doing injuries. If want of power to do ill, be an incapacity in a prince, with reverence be it &s;poken, it is an incapacity he hath in common with the Deity. Let me not doubt bat all pleas, which do not carry in them the mu|tual happine&s;s of prince and people, will appear as ab&s;urd to your great under&s;tanding, as di&s;agreeable to your noble nature.</P>
<P>Exert your&s;elf, O generous prince, again&s;t &s;uch &s;ycophants in the glorious cau&s;e of liberty; and a&s;|&s;ume &s;uch an ambition worthy of you to &s;ecure your fellow-creatures from &s;lavery; from a condition as much below that of brutes, as to act without rea&s;on, is le&s;&s; mi&s;erable than to act again&s;t it. Pre&s;erve to your future &s;ubjects the divine right of being free agents: and to your own royal hou&s;e the divine right of being their benefactors. Believe me, my prince, there is no other right can &s;low from God. While your Highne&s;s is forming your&s;elf for a throne, con&s;ider the laws as &s;o many common places in your &s;tudy of the &s;cience of government; when you mean nothing but ju&s;tice, they are an ea&s;e and help to you. This way of thinking is what gave men the glorious

appellation of Deliverers and Fathers of their coun|try; this made the &s;ight of them rou&s;e their be|holders into acclamations, and mankind incapable of bearing their very appearance, without applaud|ing it as a benefit. Con&s;ider the inexpre&s;&s;ible ad|vantages which will ever attend your Highne&s;s, while you make the power of rendering men happy the mea&s;ure of your actions.

<P>The glance of your eye will give gladne&s;s, and your every &s;entence have a force of bounty. What|ever &s;ome men would in&s;inuate, you have lo&s;t your &s;ubjects when you have lo&s;t their inclinations.

<HEAD>TREACHERY, Or the HISTORY of MOSES GOLEMUS, General to SCANDERBEG THE GREAT, King of Epirus.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG all the heroes of ancient or modern &s;tory, there are none who&s;e courage, wi&s;dom, and good fortune, have been more con&s;picuous than Scanderbeg's. King only of a &s;mall &s;tate and a handful of people, at a time when the Turki&s;h em|pire flouri&s;hed in all its &s;plendor and all its ferocity;
<PB N="174" REF="183">
when Europe and A&s;ia trembled at the multitude and valour of its troops, Scanderbeg nobly a&s;&s;erted and maintained his independence, braved the fury of the Turk, vanqui&s;hed his armies, and di&s;graced his vic|tories. Amurath the Second, after various &s;ieges and battles, died in Epirus, before the walls of Croia, cur&s;ing his ignominious fate, which after &s;o many &s;plendid conque&s;ts had &s;ent him thus di&s;honourably to expire; baffled by a prince who&s;e territories, with re&s;pect to extent, might rather be compared to the gardens of Amurath's &s;eraglio, than to the Ottoman empire. Mahomet, his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the fa|mous conqueror, who took Con&s;tantinople, and made the Chri&s;tian world tremble, never could &s;ub|due Scanderbeg. Armies after armies invaded Epi|rus, and were all either de&s;troyed, or obliged &s;hame|fully to retreat; for of all the various battles and &s;kirmi&s;hes Scanderbeg was engaged in, and they were almo&s;t innumerable, he lo&s;t but one.</P>
<P>Mahomet, who from repeated experiments and reiterated defeats, began at length to de&s;pair of &s;ub|duing Scanderbeg by open war, endeavoured to cor|rupt his generals. None among tho&s;e was more renowned than Mo&s;es Golemus. This man had been with Scanderbeg in all his wars, was acquaint|ed with all his, re&s;ources, all his &s;tratagems, and be|loved by all his &s;oldiers. His valour and conduct had often been proved, and always to his honour; no man doubted his love to his country, or his loy|alty to his prince, who&s;e confidence he fully po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed.
<PB N="175" REF="184">
Mo&s;es, who as a commander was &s;econd only to Scanderbeg, lay with a &s;trong garri&s;on in Dibra, a frontier town of Epirus, when Mahomet commanded the governor of Sfetigrade to endea|vour, by every means within his power, to &s;ubvert the loyalty of Mo&s;es. Sfetigrade was a town which the Turks had long held in Epirus. This governor, who from the known character of Mo&s;es had little hope of &s;ucce&s;s, was yet obliged to make the at|tempt, in obedience to the commands of the &s;ultan. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent a Chri&s;tian, an inhabitant of Sfetigrade, whom he had won to his intere&s;ts by large gifts, to negotiate with Mo&s;es. The me&s;&s;en|ger he cho&s;e was a &s;ubtle man, plau&s;ible and di&s;cern|ing, and inve&s;ted with full powers to make the mo&s;t advantageous propo&s;als to Mo&s;es, and to paint the e&s;teem the &s;ultan had for him and his abilities in the mo&s;t flattering colours. He came to Dibra, and, under pretence of &s;tate &s;ecrets, gained a private audience of Mo&s;es, to whom, in the name of Ma|homet, he offered whatever dignities the &s;ultan could be&s;tow. By the &s;ame authority likewi&s;e he demand|ed how he, who was known to be &s;o great a cap|tain, equal at lea&s;t, if not &s;uperior to Scanderbeg, could conde&s;cend to &s;erve &s;o petty a prince. The me&s;&s;enger &s;hewed him how ea&s;y it would be for him, if he had a proper confidence in his own ca|pacity, to dethrone Scanderbeg, by cau&s;ing a revolt in Epirus, and putting him&s;elf at the head of the Turki&s;h armies. Mo&s;es, who, till this fatal mo|ment,
<PB N="176" REF="185">
had lived in the full enjoyment of content and acknowledged worth, &s;unk before the treache|rous attacks of flattery and ambition. He di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the me&s;&s;enger without a po&s;itive an&s;wer, but with &s;ufficient rea&s;on to hope for &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>After the departure of the me&s;&s;enger, a thou&s;and troubled thoughts aro&s;e in the hitherto peaceful mind of Mo&s;es: his mirth was turned into melan|choly; the chearfulne&s;s of his countenance vani&s;h|ed; di&s;tracting fears and haughty wi&s;hes were his &s;olitary companions, and an imaginary kingdom the idol he &s;ecretly adored. Several di&s;cerning people ob&s;erved this &s;udden change, and &s;ome of his friends a&s;ked him concerning the bu&s;ine&s;s of that &s;ecret me&s;&s;enger; to whom he replied, that he was a per|&s;on from whom he received private intelligence of matters that concerned the good of the &s;tate. This an&s;wer was &s;atisfactory, for who could once think of di&s;tru&s;ting Mo&s;es?</P>
<P>It happened about this time, when the loyalty of Mo&s;es had been &s;ufficiently overthrown by various negociations and &s;plendid promi&s;es from the Turk, that Scanderbeg arrived before the walls of Belgrade, the only defeat he ever experienced from the Maho|metans. This was what Mo&s;es deemed the proper opportunity to declare him&s;elf, this was the moment to &s;ubvert his friends and &s;oldiers from their alle|giance. For this purpo&s;e, when the news arrived at Dibra he pretended at fir&s;t to be greatly afflicted, and with many words to lament the misfortune of
<PB N="177" REF="186">
Scanderbeg, and the mi&s;eries of Epirus, taking care at the &s;ame time to de&s;cribe the great power of Ma|homet, and to endeavour to fill the minds of his hearers with di&s;tru&s;t and fear. To his intimates he was more &s;incere; he related to them the mighty promi&s;es of Mahomet, the honours he would con|fer on all tho&s;e who &s;hould be in&s;trumental to a re|volt, and the great ea&s;e with which it might be then effected. He was heard by them with a&s;toni&s;h|ment and pity, but, to their glory be it remember|ed, without &s;ucce&s;s: he, therefore, thought it &s;afe&s;t to fly, which he did, accompanied only by a few of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;orderly of the common &s;ol|diers, and after procuring &s;afe conduct from the go|vernor of Sfetigrade, arrived at Con&s;tantinople, when he was joyfully received and greatly care&s;&s;ed by Ma|homet.</P>
<P>When Scanderbeg fir&s;t learnt the news of the re|volt of Mo&s;es, &s;o great had been his opinion of his fidelity, that he &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment. After a little reflection, however, and finding the fact really to be &s;o, he, with true dignity, endea|voured to palliate in&s;tead of magnifying the crime: he remembered the former virtues and &s;ervices of Mo&s;es, and &s;aid, his temptations had been &s;uch as might cau&s;e a truly great and con&s;tant man to err; he would not li&s;ten to tho&s;e who appeared willing to aggravate the offence, but &s;aid, he only wi&s;hed that all trea&s;on and ill fortune were fled with Mo&s;es out of Epirus; he remembered the loyalty of tho&s;e
<PB N="178" REF="187">
whom Mo&s;es had tried to &s;educe, and rejoiced in the faith and love of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Though Mahomet gladly received the fugitive Epirot, he was not at fir&s;t without &s;u&s;picion; he knew the former &s;tratagems of Scanderbeg and of Mo&s;es; he dreaded a counterplot, and refu&s;ed, for &s;ome time, to li&s;ten to the &s;olicitations of Mo&s;es, who was eager to put him&s;elf at the head of the Turks, and invade his promi&s;ed kingdom: after, however, having placed &s;pies upon him, and having watched him him&s;elf, and di&s;cour&s;ed with him upon the mode of conducting the war in Epirus, and find|ing him devoted to ambition, and e&s;tranged from Scanderbeg, he gave him the command of fifteen thou&s;and hor&s;e, which was all Mo&s;es de&s;ired for this con|que&s;t, and &s;ent him again&s;t the foe that Mahomet mo&s;t hated and mo&s;t feared. The &s;oldiers appointed for this &s;ervice were but half willing to go; they dreaded the fatal country of Epirus; they remembered how many Turks had gone there, never to return; they thought the pre&s;ent army far too &s;mall, though &s;uperior to that of Scanderbeg; and nothing gave them hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, but the great opinion they had of their commander.</P>
<P>Thus furni&s;hed, with a fine army, and every warlike appointment, Mo&s;es &s;et forward to carry de&s;olation into the land of his nativity, and to op|po&s;e his former deare&s;t friend, the &s;overeign he once had loved and a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all his powers.
<PB N="179" REF="188">
Scanderbeg, who was informed of his route, met him upon the frontiers of his kingdom, determined to give him fair and open battle; for he knew Mo|&s;es was too intimately acquainted with the &s;trata|gems by which he had formerly beat the Turks, and likewi&s;e with the whole face of the country, to be &s;ub|dued by policy. The battle was long and de&s;perate; both commanders did every thing that could be ex|pected from their courage and experience; they fought with the mo&s;t daring intrepidity, and directed with coolne&s;s and determined fortitude: at length the valour and fortune of Scanderbeg prevailed, the Turks were routed, and a terrible &s;laughter en&s;ued. In vain did Mo&s;es exhort them by his words and his example to continue the fight; the arms of Scan|derbeg and the &s;cimitars of his illu&s;trious &s;oldiers, who were an army of heroes, carried death at every &s;troke, and gave deci&s;ive victory. Eleven thou&s;and of the Mahometans were left upon the field, and the re&s;t e&s;caped, conducted by Mo&s;es through moun|tainous pa&s;&s;ages, with which he was perfectly ac|quainted. This &s;udden and entire defeat lowered his character &s;o much in the opinion of the Turks, that they held him afterwards in the utmo&s;t deri&s;ion. He could by no per&s;ua&s;ions prevail on the remainder of his troops to accompany him in an attempt upon Dibra, where he &s;till hoped he had friends, and by who&s;e help he thought &s;till to occa&s;ion a revolt. Finding no remedy, he marched them back to Con|&s;tantinople with a heavy heart and a dejected coun|tenance,
<PB N="180" REF="189">
de&s;pi&s;ed by the Turks and threatened by the &s;ultan, who, had it not been for the advice of his viziers, who &s;hewed him the impolicy of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, would have put him to death.</P>
<P>Of &s;o little e&s;timation was he now become in the Ottoman court, that his allowance was &s;carcely &s;ufficient for his maintenance; and though he ap|peared to bear his misfortunes patiently, he was inwardly &s;o afflicted, that he could neither eat nor drink: the remembrance of his former trea&s;on was continually before his eyes, and the di&s;grace he &s;uf|fered at the Turki&s;h court, tormented him with in|tolerable grief. He was con&s;cious of having done every thing in his power in the late battle; and the frowns of Mahomet, who e&s;timated abilities by events only, filled him with a &s;ecret indignation. Sometimes he thought of e&s;caping from Con&s;tan|tinople, and throwing him&s;elf upon the clemency of his prince, whom he knew to be of a noble and for|giving nature; but when he recollected the extent of his ingratitude, he was &s;truck with &s;hame. How|ever, after an afflicting &s;truggle of contending pa&s;|&s;ions, he at la&s;t re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to the mercy of Scanderbeg, rather choo&s;ing to &s;tand the chance of &s;uffering the de&s;ert of his crimes in his own country, than to have the deri&s;ion of a people he de&s;pi&s;ed. He accordingly fled to Dibra. When the &s;oldiers be|held their old governor thus de&s;pondent and repent|ing, they forgot the evils he had been the occa|&s;ion of, and moved with compa&s;&s;ion, received him
<PB N="181" REF="190">
with tears and friendly embraces, and brought him to Scanderbeg, who lay encamped not far from them. The manner in which Mo&s;es approached him was awful and humiliating. He put his girdle round his neck, in token of his de&s;erts, as was the cu&s;tom of the Epirots, and with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible contrition fell upon his knees before Scanderbeg, who was walking in the front of his tent. Scan|derbeg, as benevolent in peace as terrible in war, rai&s;ed him from the earth, embraced him, and, as a certain token of forgivene&s;s in Epirus, ki&s;&s;ed his cheek. He did not &s;top here; he cau&s;ed all his lands and riches to be re&s;tored, re-in&s;tated him in all his former tru&s;ts and employments, and, by open proclamation, commanded that no man &s;hould here|after mention the tre&s;pa&s;s.</P>
<P>After this Mo&s;es &s;erved Scanderbeg in his wars with &s;till greater zeal and a&s;&s;iduity, than he had for|merly done; but happening in a &s;kirmi&s;h, contrary to the advice of Scanderbeg, to pur&s;ue a flying party of Turks too far, he fell into an ambu&s;cade, was taken pri&s;oner, carried to Con&s;tantinople, and, by the command of Mahomet, put to a cruel death; a fate which in all probability he would never have &s;uffered, had he never been a Traitor.</P>

<P>AMURATH, &s;ultan of the Ea&s;t, the judge of nations, the di&s;ciple of adver&s;ity, records the wonders of his life: let tho&s;e who pre&s;umptuou&s;ly que&s;tion the ways of Providence, blu&s;h in &s;ilence and be wi&s;e; let the proud be humble and obtain honour; and let the &s;en&s;ual reform and be happy.</P>
<P>The angel of Death clo&s;ed the eyes of the &s;ultan Abradin my father, and his empire de&s;cended to me in the eighteenth year of my age. At fir&s;t my mind was awed to humility, and &s;oftened with grief; I was in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;plendor of dominion, I heard the addre&s;&s;es of flattery with di&s;gu&s;t, and received the homage of dependant greatne&s;s with indifference. I had always regarded my father not only with love but reverence; and I was now perpetually recol|lecting in&s;tances of his tenderne&s;s, and reviewing the &s;olemn &s;cene, in which he recommended me to Heaven in imperfect language, and gra&s;ped my hand in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>One evening, after having concealed my&s;elf all day in his chamber, I vi&s;ited his grave: I pro&s;trated my&s;elf on his tomb; &s;orrow overflowed my eyes, and devotion kindled in my bo&s;om. I felt my&s;elf &s;uddenly &s;mitten on the &s;houlder as with a rod; and looking up, I perceived a man who&s;e eyes were pier|cing as light, and his beard whiter than &s;now. "I
<PB N="184" REF="193">
am, &s;aid he, the Genius Syndarac, the friend of thy father Abradin, who was the fear of his enemies and the de&s;ire of his people; who&s;e &s;mile diffu&s;ed glad|ne&s;s like the lu&s;tre of the morning, and who&s;e frown was dreadful as the gathering of a tempe&s;t: re&s;ign thy&s;elf to my influence, and thou &s;halt be like him." I bowed my&s;elf to the earth in token of gratitude and obedience, and he put a ring on the middle fin|ger of my left-hand, in which I perceived a ruby of a deep colour and uncommon brightne&s;s. "This ring, &s;aid he, &s;hall mark out to thee the boundaries of good and evil; that, without weighing remote con&s;equences, thou maye&s;t know the nature and tendency of every action. Be attentive therefore to the &s;ilent admonition: and when the circle of gold &s;hall, by a &s;udden contraction, pre&s;s thy finger, and the ruby &s;hall grow pale, de&s;i&s;t immediately from what thou &s;halt be doing, and mark down that ac|tion in thy memory, as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Rule of Right:</HI> keep my gift as a pledge of happine&s;s and honour, and take it not off for a moment." I re|ceived the ring with a &s;en&s;e of obligation which I &s;trove to expre&s;s, and an a&s;toni&s;hment that compelled me to be &s;ilent. The Genius perceived my confu|&s;ion, and turning from me with a &s;mile of compla|cency, immediately di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t moon I was &s;o cautious and cir|cum&s;pect, that my plea&s;ure in reflecting that my ring had not once indicated a fault, was le&s;&s;ened by my doubts of its virtue. I applied my&s;elf to the public
<PB N="185" REF="194">
bu&s;ine&s;s. My melancholy decrea&s;ed, as my mind was diverted to other objects; and, le&s;t the youths of my court &s;hould think that recreation was too long &s;u&s;pended, I appointed to hunt the lion. But though I went out to the &s;port rather to gratify others than my&s;elf, yet my u&s;ual ardour returned in the field; I grew warm in the pur&s;uit, I continued the chace, which was un&s;ucce&s;sful, too long, and returned fatigued and di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>As I entered the &s;eraglio, I was met by a little dog that had been my father's, who expre&s;&s;ed his joy at my return, by jumping round me and en|deavouring to reach my hand: but as I was not di&s;po&s;ed to receive his care&s;&s;es, I &s;truck him in the fretfulne&s;s of my di&s;plea&s;ure &s;o &s;evere a blow with my foot, that it left him &s;carce power to crawl away, and hide him&s;elf under a &s;ofa, in the corner of the apartment. At this moment I felt the ring pre&s;s my finger, and looking upon the ruby, I perceived the glow of its colour abated.</P>
<P>I was at fir&s;t &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e and regret; but &s;urpri&s;e and regret quickly gave way to di&s;dain. "Shall not the &s;ultan Amurath, &s;aid I, to whom a thou&s;and kings pay tribute, and in who&s;e hand is the life of nations, &s;hall not Amurath &s;trike a dog that offends him, without being reproached for hav|ing tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rule of Right?</HI> My ring again pre&s;&s;ed my finger, and the ruby became more pale: immediately the palace &s;hook with a bur&s;t of thun|der,
<PB N="186" REF="195">
and the Genius Syndarac again &s;tood before me.</P>
<P>"Amurath, &s;aid he, thou ha&s;t offended again&s;t thy brother of the du&s;t; a being who, like thee, has re|ceived from the Almighty a capacity of plea&s;ure and pain: plea&s;ure which caprice is not allowed to &s;u&s;|pend, and pain which ju&s;tice only has a right to in|flict. If thou art ju&s;tified by power in afflicting in|ferior beings, I &s;hould be ju&s;tified in afflicting thee: but my power yet &s;pares thee, becau&s;e it is directed by the laws of &s;overeign goodne&s;s, and becau&s;e thou maye&s;t yet be reclaimed by admonition. But yield not to the impul&s;e of quick re&s;entment, nor indulge in cruelty the forwardne&s;s of di&s;gu&s;t, le&s;t by the laws of goodne&s;s I be compelled to afflict thee; for he that &s;corns reproof, mu&s;t be reformed by pu|ni&s;hment, or lo&s;t for ever."</P>
<P>At the pre&s;ence of Syndarac I was troubled, and his words covered me with confu&s;ion: I fell pro&s;trate at his feet, and heard him pronounce with a milder accent, "Expect not henceforth that I &s;hould an|&s;wer the demands of arrogance, or gratify the cu|rio&s;ity of &s;peculation: confide in my friend&s;hip, and tru&s;t implicitly to thy ring."</P>
<P>As the chace had produced &s;o much infelicity I did not repeat it, but invited my nobles to a banquet, and entertained them with dancing and mu&s;ic. I had given leave that all ceremony &s;hould be &s;u&s;|pended, and that the company &s;hould treat me not as a &s;overeign but an equal, becau&s;e the conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="187" REF="196">
would otherwi&s;e be incumbered or re&s;trained; and I encouraged others to plea&s;antry, by indulging the luxuriancy of my own imagination. But tho' I affected to throw off the trappings of royalty, I had not &s;ufficient magnanimity to de&s;pi&s;e them. I en|joyed the voluntary deference which was paid me, and was &s;ecretly offended at Alibeg my vi&s;ier, who endeavoured to prevail upon the a&s;&s;embly to enjoy the liberty that had been given them, and was him&s;elf an example of the conduct that he recommended. I &s;ingled out as the object of my raillery, the man who alone de&s;erved my approbation: he believed my con|de&s;cen&s;ion to be &s;incere, and imagining that he was &s;ecuring my favour, by that behaviour which had incurred my di&s;plea&s;ure; he was, therefore, grieved and confounded to perceive, that I laboured to ren|der him ridiculous and contemptible: I enjoyed his pain, and was elated at my &s;ucce&s;s; but my atten|tion was &s;uddenly called to my ring, and I per|ceived the ruby change colour. I de&s;i&s;ted for a mo|ment; but &s;ome of my courtiers having di&s;covered and &s;econded my intention, I felt my vanity and my re&s;entment gratified; I endeavoured to wa&s;h away the remembrance of my ring with wine; my &s;atire became more bitter, and Alibeg di&s;covered yet greater di&s;tre&s;s. My ring again reproached me; but I &s;till per&s;evered. The vi&s;ier was at length rou&s;ed to his defence; probably he had di&s;covered and de&s;pi&s;ed my weakne&s;s: his replies were &s;o poignant, that I became outrageous, and de&s;cended from raillery to
<PB N="188" REF="197">
invective: at length di&s;gui&s;ing the angui&s;h of his mind with a &s;mile, "Amurath, &s;aid he, if the Sultan &s;hould know, that after having invited your friends to fe&s;tivity and merriment, you had a&s;&s;umed this au|thority, and in&s;ulted tho&s;e who were not aware that you di&s;dained to be treated with the familiarity of friend&s;hip, you would certainly fall under his di&s;|plea&s;ure." The &s;everity of this &s;arca&s;m, which was extorted by long provocation from a man warmed with wine, &s;tung me with intolerable rage; I &s;tart|ed up, and &s;purning him from the table, was about to draw my poignard; when my attention was again called to my ring, and I perceived with &s;ome degree of regret, that the ruby had faded almo&s;t to a perfect white.</P>
<P>But, in&s;tead of being re&s;olved to be more watch|ful again&s;t whatever might bring me under this &s;ilent reproof, I comforted my&s;elf, that the Genius would no more alarm me with his pre&s;ence. The irregu|larities of my conduct increa&s;ed almo&s;t impercep|tibly, and the intimations of my ring became propor|tionably more frequent, though le&s;s forcible, till at la&s;t they were &s;o familiar, that I &s;carce remarked when they were given and when &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon di&s;covered that I was plea&s;ed with &s;er|vility; &s;ervility therefore was practi&s;ed, and I reward|ed it &s;ometimes with a pen&s;ion and &s;ometimes with a place. Thus the government of my kingdoms was left to petty tyrants, who oppre&s;&s;ed the people to en|rich them&s;elves. In the mean time, I filled my &s;e|raglio
<PB N="189" REF="198">
with women, and abandoned my&s;elf to &s;en|&s;uality. But I had not yet &s;tained my hands with blood, nor dared to ridicule the laws which I had neglected to fulfil.</P>
<P>My re&s;entment again&s;t Alibeg, however unju&s;t, was inflexible, and terminated in the mo&s;t perfect hatred; I degraded him from his office; but I &s;till kept him at Court, that I might imbitter his life by perpetual indignities, and practi&s;e again&s;t him new &s;chemes of malevolence.</P>
<P>Selima, the daughter of this prince, had been in|tended by my father for my wife: and the mar|riage had been delayed only by his death: but the plea&s;ure and the dignity that Alibeg would derive from this alliance, had now changed my purpo&s;e. Yet &s;uch was the beauty of Selima, that I gazed with de&s;ire; and &s;uch was her wit, that I li&s;tened with delight. I therefore re&s;olved, that I would, if po&s;|&s;ible, &s;educe her to voluntary pro&s;titution; and that when her beauty &s;hould yield to the charm of va|riety, I would di&s;mi&s;s her with marks of di&s;grace. But in this attempt I could not &s;ucceed; my &s;oli|citations were rejected, &s;ometimes with tears, and &s;ometimes with reproach. I became every day more wretched, by &s;eeking to bring calamities on others; I con&s;idered my di&s;appointment as the triumph of a &s;lave, whom I wi&s;hed but did not dare to de&s;troy; and I regarded his daughter as the in&s;trument of my di&s;honour. Thus the tenderne&s;s, which before had &s;haken my purpo&s;e, was weakened; my de&s;ire
<PB N="190" REF="199">
of beauty became as &s;elfi&s;h and as &s;ordid an appe|tite as my de&s;ire of food; and, as I had no hope of obtaining the complete gratification of my lu&s;t and my revenge, I determined to enjoy Selima by force, as the only expedient to alleviate my torment.</P>
<P>She re&s;ided by my command in an apartment of the &s;eraglio, and I entered her chamber at midnight by a private door, of which I had a key; but with inexpre&s;&s;ible vexation I found it empty. To be thus di&s;appointed in my la&s;t attempt, at the very moment in which I thought I had in&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s, di&s;tracted me with rage; and in&s;tead of returning to my cham|ber, and concealing my de&s;ign, I called for her wo|men. They ran in pale and trembling: I demanded the lady; they gazed at me a&s;toni&s;hed and terrified, and then looking upon each other, &s;tood &s;ilent: I re|peated my demand with fury and execration, and to enforce it, called aloud for the mini&s;ters of death&punc; they then fell pro&s;trate at my feet, and declared with one voice, that they knew not where &s;he was; that they had left her, when they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for the night, &s;itting on a &s;ofa pen&s;ive and alone; and that no per&s;on had &s;ince, to their knowledge, pa&s;&s;ed in or out of her apartment.</P>
<P>In this account, however incredible, they per&s;i&s;ted without variation; and having filled the palace with alarm and confu&s;ion, I was obliged to retire without gaining any intelligence by what means I had been baffled, or on whom to turn my re&s;entment. I re|viewed
<PB N="191" REF="200">
the tran&s;actions of the night with angui&s;h and regret, and bewildered my&s;elf among the innumer|able po&s;&s;ibilities that might have produced my di&s;|appointment. I remembered that the windows of Selima's apartments were open, and I imagined that &s;he might that way have e&s;caped into the gardens of the &s;eraglio. But why &s;hould &s;he e&s;cape who had never been confined? If &s;he had de&s;igned to depart, &s;he might have departed by day. Had &s;he an a&s;&s;ig|nation? And did &s;he intend to return, without been known to have been ab&s;ent? This &s;uppo&s;ition increa&s;ed my torment; becau&s;e, if it were true, Selima had granted to my &s;lave that which &s;he re|fu&s;ed to me. But all the&s;e conjectures were uncer|tain, I determined to make her ab&s;ence a pretence to de&s;troy her father.</P>
<P>In the morning I gave orders that her father &s;hould be &s;eized and brought before me; but while I was yet &s;peaking he entered, and pro&s;trating him|&s;elf, thus anticipated my accu&s;ation: "May the &s;ultan Amurath, in who&s;e wrath the angel of death goes forth, rejoice for ever in the &s;miles of heaven! Let the wretched Alibeg peri&s;h; but let my Lord remember Selima with mercy; let him di&s;mi&s;s the &s;lave in whom he cea&s;es to delight." I heard no more, but cried out, "Dare&s;t thou to mock me with a reque&s;t, to di&s;mi&s;s the daughter whom thou ha&s;t &s;tolen! Thou who&s;e life, that has been &s;o often forfeited, I have yet &s;pared! Re&s;tore her within one hour, or affronted mercy &s;hall give thee up."</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="201">"Oh! &s;aid he, let not the mighty &s;overeign of the Ea&s;t, &s;port with the mi&s;ery of the weak. If thou ha&s;t doomed us to death, let us die to|gether."</P>
<P>Though I was now convinced that Alibeg be|lieved I had confined Selima, and decreed her death, yet I re&s;olved to per&s;i&s;t in requiring her at his hands; and therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with a repetition of my command, to produce her within an hour, upon pain of death.</P>
<P>My ring, which during this &s;eries of events, had given perpetual intimation of guilt, which was al|ways di&s;regarded, now pre&s;&s;ed my finger &s;o forcibly, that it gave me great pain, and compelled my no|tice. I immediately retired, and gave way to the di&s;content that &s;welled in my bo&s;om. "How wretched a &s;lave is Amurath to an invi&s;ible tyrant! A being, who&s;e malevolence or envy has re&s;trained me in the exerci&s;e of my authority as a prince, and who&s;e cunning has contrived perpetually to in&s;ult me, by intimating that every action of my life is a crime! How long &s;hall I groan under this intoler|able oppre&s;&s;ion? This accur&s;ed ring is the badge and the in&s;trument of my &s;ubjection and di&s;honour: he who gave it, is now, perhaps, in &s;ome remote re|gion of the air; perhaps he rolls &s;ome planet in its orbit, agitates the &s;outhern ocean with a tempe&s;t, or &s;hakes &s;ome di&s;tant region with an earthquake: but wherever he is, he has &s;urely a more important employ than to watch my conduct. Perhaps he has
<PB N="193" REF="202">
contrived this tali&s;man, only to re&s;train me from the enjoyment of &s;ome good, which he wi&s;hes to withhold; I feel that my de&s;ires are controuled; and to gratify the&s;e de&s;ires is to be happy." As I pro|nounced the&s;e words I drew off the ring, and threw it to the ground with di&s;dain and indignation: im|mediately the air grew dark; a cloud bur&s;t in thun|der over my head, and the eye of Syndarac was upon me. I &s;tood before him motionle&s;s and &s;ilent: hor|ror thrilled in my veins, and my hair &s;tood upright. I had neither power to deprecate his anger, nor to con|fe&s;s my faults. In his countenance appeared a calm &s;everity, and he pronounced the&s;e words: "Thou ha&s;t now, as far as is in thy power, thrown off hu|manity, and degraded thy being; thy form there|fore &s;hall no longer conceal thy nature, nor thy ex|ample render thy vices contagious." He then touch|ed me with his rod, and, while the &s;ound of his voice yet vibrated in my ears, I found my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a de&s;art, not in the form of a man but of a mon&s;ter, with the fore parts of my body like a wolf, and the hinder parts like a goat. I was &s;till con|&s;cious to every event of my life, and my intellectual powers were continued, though my pa&s;&s;ions were ir|ritated to frenzy. I now rolled in the &s;and in agonies not to be de&s;cribed; and now ha&s;tily traver&s;ed the de&s;ert, impelled only by the vain de&s;ire of flying from my&s;elf. I now bellowed with rage, and now howled in de&s;pair; this moment I breathed execrations
<PB N="194" REF="203">
again&s;t the Genius, and the next reproached my&s;elf for having forfeited his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>By this violent agitation of mind and body, the powers of both were &s;oon exhau&s;ted: I crawled into a den which I perceived near me, and immediately &s;unk down in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. I &s;lept; but &s;leep, in&s;tead of prolonging, put an end to this in|terval of quiet. The Genius &s;till terrified me with his pre&s;ence; I heard his &s;entence repeated, and felt again all the horrors of my transformation. When I waked, I was not refre&s;hed: calamity, though it compelled me to admit &s;lumber, can yet exclude re&s;t. But I was now rou&s;ed with hunger; for hunger, like &s;leep, is irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>I went out in &s;earch of prey; and if I felt any allevation of mi&s;ery be&s;ides the hope of &s;atisfying my appetite, it was in the thought of tearing to pieces whatever I &s;hould meet, and inflicting &s;ome part of the evil which I endured; for though I re|gretted my puni&s;hment, I did not repent of my crimes: and as I imagined Syndarac would now neither mitigate nor increa&s;e my &s;ufferings, I was not re&s;trained, either by hope or fear, from indulg|ing my di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty and revenge. But while I was thus meditating the de&s;truction of others, I trembled, left by &s;ome &s;tronger &s;avage I &s;hould be de&s;troyed my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this variety of torment, I heard the cry of dogs, the trampling of hor&s;es, and the &s;houts of the hunters; and &s;uch is the love of life,
<PB N="195" REF="204">
however wretched, that my heart &s;unk within me at the &s;ound. To hide my&s;elf was impo&s;&s;ible, and I was too much enfeebled either to fly or re&s;i&s;t. I &s;tood &s;till till they come up. At fir&s;t they gazed on me with wonder, and doubted whether they &s;hould advance: but at length a &s;lave threw a net over me, and I was dragged to the city.</P>
<P>I now entered the metropolis of my empire, amid&s;t the noi&s;e and tumult of the rabble, who the day be|fore would have hid them&s;elves at my pre&s;ence. I heard the &s;ound of mu&s;ic at a di&s;tance: the heralds approached, and Alibeg was proclaimed in my &s;tead. I was now de&s;erted by the multitude, who&s;e curio|&s;ity was diverted by the pomp of his proce&s;&s;ion; and was conducted to the place where other &s;avages are kept, which cu&s;tom has con&s;idered as part of the regalia.</P>
<P>My keeper was a black &s;lave, whom I did not re|member ever to have &s;een, and in whom it would indeed have been a fatal pre&s;umption to have &s;tood before me. After he had given me food, and the vigour of nature was re&s;tored, he di&s;covered in me &s;uch tokens of ferocity, that he &s;uffered me to fa&s;t many hours before I was again fed. I was &s;o en|raged at this delay, that, forgetting my dependance, I roared horribly when he again approached me: &s;o that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to add blows to hunger, that he might gain &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over me, as was &s;uitable to his office. By this &s;lave, therefore, I was alternately beaten and fami&s;hed, till the fierce|ne&s;s
<PB N="196" REF="205">
of my di&s;po&s;ition being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by fear and languor, a milder temper in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole upon me; and a demeanour that was begun by con&s;traint, was continued by habit.</P>
<P>I was now treated with le&s;s &s;everity, and &s;trove to expre&s;s &s;omething like gratitude, that might en|courage my keeper to yet greater kindne&s;s. His vanity was flattered by my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and, to &s;hew as well his courage as the &s;ucce&s;s of his di&s;cipline, he ventured &s;ometimes to care&s;s me in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who&s;e curio&s;ity brought them to &s;ee me. A kind of friend&s;hip thus imperceptibly grew be|tween us, and I felt &s;ome degree of the affection that I had feigned. It happened that a tyger which had been lately taken, brake one day into my den while my keeper was giving me my provi&s;ion, and leaping upon him, would in&s;tantly have torn him to pieces, if I had not &s;eized the &s;avage by the throat, and dragged him to the ground: the &s;lave pre&s;ently di&s;patched him with his dagger, and turned about to care&s;s his deliverer; but &s;tarting &s;uddenly back|ward, he &s;tood motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment, per|ceiving that I was no longer a mon&s;ter, but a dog.</P>
<P>I was my&s;elf con&s;cious of the change which had again pa&s;&s;ed upon me, and leaping out of my den, e&s;caped from my confinement. This transforma|tion I con&s;idered as a reward for my fidelity, and was, perhaps, never more happy than in the fir&s;t mo|ments of my e&s;cape; for I reflected, that as a dog my liberty was not only re&s;tored, but in&s;ured; I was
<PB N="197" REF="206">
no longer &s;u&s;pected of qualities which rendered me unfit for &s;ociety; I had &s;ome faint re&s;emblance of human virtue, which is not found in other animals, and therefore hoped to be more generally care&s;&s;ed. But it was not long before this joy &s;ub&s;ided in the remembrance of that dignity from which I had fallen, and from which I was &s;till at an immea&s;urable di&s;tance. Yet I lifted up my heart in gratitude to that Power, who had once more brought me within the circle of nature. As a brute I was more thank|ful for a mitigation of puni&s;hment, than as a king I had been for offers of the highe&s;t happine&s;s and honour. And who, that is not taught by affliction, can ju&s;tly e&s;timate the bounties of Heaven?</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t tumult of my mind was pa&s;t, I felt an irre&s;i&s;tible inclination once more to vi&s;it the apartments of my &s;eraglio. I placed my&s;elf be|hind an emir, whom I knew to have been the friend of Alibeg, and was permitted to follow him into the pre&s;ence. The per&s;ons and the place, the retro|&s;pection of my life which they produced, and the compari&s;on of what I was with what I had been, al|mo&s;t overwelmed me. I went unob&s;erved into the garden, and lay down under the &s;hade of an al|mond-tree, that I might indulge tho&s;e reflections, which, though they oppre&s;&s;ed me with melancholy, I did not wi&s;h to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this place, before a little dog, which I knew to be the &s;ame that I &s;purned from me when he care&s;&s;ed me at my return from
<PB N="198" REF="207">
hunting, came and fawned at my feet. My heart now &s;mote me, and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, "Do&s;t thou know me under this di&s;gui&s;e? Is thy fidelity to thy lord un&s;haken? Cut off as I am from the conver&s;e of mankind, ha&s;t thou pre&s;erved for me an affection, which I once &s;o lightly e&s;teemed, and requited with evil? This forgetfulne&s;s of injury, and this &s;teady friend&s;hip, are they le&s;s than human, or are they more?" I was not prevented by the&s;e reflections from returning tho&s;e care&s;&s;es that I received; and Alibeg, who ju&s;t then entered the garden, took no|tice of me, and ordered that I &s;hould not be turned out.</P>
<P>In the &s;eraglio I &s;oon learned, that a body, which was thought to be mine, was found dead in the chamber; and that Alibeg had been cho&s;en to &s;uc|ceed me, by the unanimous voice of the people. But I gained no intelligence of Selima, who&s;e apart|ment I found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another, and for whom I had &s;earched every part of the palace in vain. I became re&s;tle&s;s; every place was irk&s;ome; a de&s;ire to wander prevailed; and one evening I went out at the garden gate, and, travelling till midnight, I lay down at the foot of a &s;ycamore-tree, and &s;lept.</P>
<P>In the morning, I beheld with &s;urpri&s;e a wall of marble that &s;eemed to reach to heaven, and gates that were &s;culptured with every emblem of delight. Over the gate was in&s;cribed in letters of gold, "Within this wall liberty is unbounded, and fe|licity complete: nature is not oppre&s;&s;ed by the ty|ranny
<PB N="109" REF="208">
of religion, nor is plea&s;ure awed by the frown of virtue. The gate is obedient to thy wi&s;h, who|&s;oever thou art: enter therefore, and be happy."</P>
<P>When I read this in&s;cription, my bo&s;om throbbed with tumultuous expectation: but my de&s;ire to enter was repre&s;&s;ed by the reflection that I had lo&s;t the form, in which alone I could gratify the appetites of a man. De&s;ire and curio&s;ity were notwith&s;tand|ing predominant: the door immediately opened in|ward; I entered, and it clo&s;ed after me.</P>
<P>But my ears were now &s;tunned with the di&s;&s;o|nance of riot, and my eye &s;ickened at the contor|&s;ions of mi&s;ery: di&s;ea&s;e was vi&s;ible in every coun|tenance, however otherwi&s;e impre&s;&s;ed with the cha|racter of rage, of drunkenne&s;s, or of lu&s;t. Rape and murder, revelling and &s;trife, filled every &s;treet and every dwelling.</P>
<P>As my retreat was cut off, I went forward with timidity and circum&s;pection; for I imagined, that I could no otherwi&s;e e&s;cape injury, than by eluding the notice of wretches, who&s;e propen&s;ity to ill was re&s;trained by no law; and I perceived too late, that to puni&s;h vice is to promote happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was now evening; and that I might pa&s;s the night in greater &s;ecurity, I quitted the public way, and perceiving a hou&s;e that was encircled by a mote, I &s;wam over to it, and cho&s;e an ob&s;cure corner of the area for my a&s;ylum. I heard from within the &s;ound of dancing and mu&s;ic: but after a &s;hort in|terval, was alarmed with the menaces of rage, the
<PB N="200" REF="209">
&s;hrieks of terror, and the wailings of di&s;tre&s;s. The window of the banqueting room flew open, and &s;ome veni&s;on was thrown out which fell ju&s;t at my feet. As I had eaten nothing &s;ince my departure from the &s;eraglio, I regarded this as a fortunate ac|cident; and after the plea&s;ure of an unexpected re|pa&s;t, I again lay down in expectation of the morn|ing, with hope and fear: but in a &s;hort time many per&s;ons ru&s;hed from the hou&s;e with lights, and &s;eem|ed &s;olicitous to gather up the veni&s;on which had been thrown out; but not being able to find it, and at the &s;ame time perceiving me, they judged I had devoured it. I was immediately &s;eized and led into the hou&s;e: but as I could not di&s;cover, that I was the object either of malignity or kindne&s;s, I was in doubt what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the event. It was not long before this doubt was &s;olved; for I &s;oon learned from the di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e about me, that I was &s;u&s;pected to have eaten poi&s;on which had been intended for another, and was &s;ecured, that the ef|fect might either remove or confirm the &s;u&s;picion. As it was not expected that the poi&s;on would imme|diately operate, I was locked up in the room by my|&s;elf, where I reflected upon the cau&s;e and event of my confinement with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, anxiety, and terror.</P>
<P>In this gloomy interval, a &s;udden light &s;hone round me, and I found my&s;elf once more in the pre|&s;ence of the genius; I crawled towards him trem|bling and confounded, but not utterly without hope.
<PB N="201" REF="210">
"Yet a few moments, &s;aid he, and the angel of death &s;hall teach thee, that the wants of nature can|not be &s;upplied with &s;afety, where the inordinate appetites of vice are not re&s;trained. Thy hunger required food: but the lu&s;t and revenge of others have given thee poi&s;on." My blood grew chill as he &s;pake, I di&s;covered and abhorred my folly: but while I wi&s;hed to expre&s;s my contrition, I fell down in an agony; my eyes failed me, I &s;hivered, was convul&s;ed, and expired.</P>
<P>That &s;park of immaterial fire which no violence can quench, ro&s;e up from the du&s;t which had thus been re&s;tored to the earth, and now animated the form of a dove. On this new &s;tate of exi&s;tence I entered with inexpre&s;&s;ible delight; I imagined that my wings were not only a pledge of &s;afety, but of the favour of Syndarac, whom I was now more than ever &s;olicitous to plea&s;e. I flew immediately from the window, and turning to the wall through which I had entered, I endeavoured to ri&s;e above it, that I might quit for ever a place in which guilt and wretchedne&s;s were complicated in every object, and which I now dete&s;ted as much as before I had de|&s;ired. But over this region a &s;ulphureous vapour hovered like a thick cloud, which I had no &s;ooner entered, than I fell down panting for breath, and had &s;carce &s;trength to keep my wings &s;ufficiently extended to break my fall. It was now midnight, and I alighted near the mouth of a cave, in which I thought there appeared &s;ome faint glimmerings of
<PB N="202" REF="211">
light. Into this place I entered without much ap|prehen&s;ion; as it &s;eemed rather to be the retreat of Penitence, than the rece&s;s of Luxury: but left the noi&s;e of my wings &s;hould di&s;cover me to any hateful or mi&s;chievous inhabitant of this gloomy &s;o|litude, I entered in &s;ilence and upon my feet. As I went forward, the cave grew wider; and by the light of a lamp which was &s;u&s;pended from the roof, I di&s;covered a hermit li&s;tening to a young lady, who &s;eemed to be greatly affected with the events which &s;he was relating. Of the hermit I had no know|ledge; but the lady I di&s;cerned to be Selima. I was &s;truck with amazement at this di&s;covery; I remem|bered with the deepe&s;t contrition my attempts upon her virtue, and I now &s;ecretly rejoiced that &s;he had rendered them ineffectual: I watched her lips with the utmo&s;t impatience of curio&s;ity, and &s;he conti|nued her narrative.</P>
<P>"I was &s;itting on a &s;ofa one evening after I had been care&s;&s;ed by Amurath, and my imagination kindled as I mu&s;ed. Why, &s;aid I aloud, &s;hould I give up the delights of love with the &s;plendor of royalty? Since the pre&s;umption of my father has prevented my marriage, why &s;hould I not accept the ble&s;&s;ings that are &s;till offered? Why is de&s;ire re|&s;trained by the dread of &s;hame? And why is the pride of virtue offended by the &s;oftne&s;s of nature? Immediately a thick cloud &s;urrounded me; I felt my&s;elf lifted up and conveyed through the air with incredible rapidity. I de&s;cended, the cloud di&s;&s;ipat|ed,
<PB N="203" REF="212">
and I found my&s;elf &s;itting in an alcove, by the &s;ide of a canal that encircled a &s;tately edifice and a &s;pacious garden. I &s;aw many per&s;ons pa&s;s along; but di&s;covered in all either &s;omething di&s;&s;olute or wretched, &s;omething that alarmed my fears or ex|cited my pity. I &s;uddenly perceived many men with their &s;words drawn, contending for a woman, who was forced along irre&s;i&s;tibly by the crowd, which moved directly towards the place in which I was &s;itting. I was terrified, and looked round me with eagerne&s;s to &s;ee where I could retreat for &s;afety. A per&s;on richly dre&s;&s;ed perceived my di&s;tre&s;s, and in|vited me into the hou&s;e which the canal &s;urrounded. Of this invitation I ha&s;tily accepted with gratitude and joy: but I &s;oon remarked &s;everal incidents, which filled me with new perplexity and apprehen|&s;ion. I was welcomed to a place, in which infamy and honour were equally unknown; where every wi&s;h was indulged without the violation of any law, and where the will was therefore determined only by appetite. I was pre&s;ently &s;urrounded by women, who&s;e behaviour covered me with blu&s;hes; and though I rejected the care&s;&s;es of the per&s;on into who&s;e power I was delivered, yet they became jealous of the di&s;tinction with which he treated me. My expo&s;tulations were not heard, and my tears were treated with merriment: preparations were made for revelling and jollity; I was invited to join the dance, and upon my refu&s;al, I was entertained with mu&s;ic. In this dreadful &s;ituation, I &s;ighed thus
<PB N="204" REF="213">
to my&s;elf: "How &s;evere is that ju&s;tice which tran|&s;ports tho&s;e who form licentious wi&s;hes, to a &s;ociety in which they are indulged without re&s;traint! Who &s;hall deliver me from the effects of my own folly? Who &s;hall defend me again&s;t the vices of others?" At this moment I was thus encouraged by the voice of &s;ome invi&s;ible being: "The friends of Virtue are mighty; reject not their protection, and thou art &s;afe." As I renounced the pre&s;umptuous wi&s;h which had once polluted my mind, I exulted in this intimation with an a&s;&s;urance of relief, and when &s;upper was &s;et before me, I &s;uffered the principal lady to &s;erve me with &s;ome veni&s;on; but the friendly voice having warned me that it was poi&s;oned, I fell back in my &s;eat, and turned pale: the lady enquired earne&s;tly what had di&s;ordered me; but in&s;tead of making a reply, I threw the veni&s;on from the win|dow, and declared that &s;he had intended my death. The ma&s;ter of the table, who perceived the lady to whom I &s;poke change countenance, was at once convinced, that &s;he had indeed attempted to poi&s;on me, to pre&s;erve that intere&s;t which, as a rival, &s;he feared I &s;hould &s;ubvert. He ro&s;e up in a rage, and commanded the veni&s;on to be produced; a dog that was &s;uppo&s;ed to have eaten it was brought in: but before the event could be known, the tumult was become general; and my rival, after having &s;ud|denly &s;tabbed her patron, plunged the &s;ame poignard in her own bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="214">"In the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion, I found means to e&s;cape, and wandered through the city in &s;earch of &s;ome ob&s;cure rece&s;s, where, if I received not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which I hoped, death at la&s;t might &s;e|cure my per&s;on from violence, and clo&s;e mine eyes on tho&s;e &s;cenes, which, wherever I turned, filled me not only with di&s;gu&s;t but with horror. By that benevolent power, who, as a pre&s;ervative from mi|&s;ery, has placed in us a &s;ecret and irre&s;i&s;tible di&s;ap|probation of vice, my feet have been directed to thee, who&s;e virtue has participated in my di&s;tre&s;s, and who&s;e wi&s;dom may effect my deliverance."</P>
<P>I gazed upon Selima, while I thus learned the ar|dor of that affection which I had abu&s;ed, with &s;en|timents that can never be conceived but when they are felt. I was touched with the mo&s;t bitter remor&s;e for having produced one wi&s;h that could &s;tain &s;o amiable a mind; and abhorred my&s;elf for having u&s;ed the power which I derived from her tenderne&s;s, to effect her de&s;truction. My fondne&s;s was not le&s;s ardent, but it was more cha&s;te and tender; de&s;ire was not extingui&s;hed, but it was almo&s;t ab&s;orbed in e&s;teem. I felt a pa&s;&s;ion, to which, till now, I had been a &s;tranger; and the moment love was kindled in my brea&s;t, I re&s;umed the form proper to the na|ture in which alone it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and Selima beheld Amurath at her feet. At my &s;udden and unexpect|ed appearance, the colour faded from her cheeks, the powers of life were &s;u&s;pended, and &s;he &s;unk into my arms. I cla&s;ped her to my brea&s;t, and
<PB N="206" REF="215">
looking towards the hermit for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I be|held in his &s;tead the friendly genius, who had taught me happine&s;s by affliction. At the &s;ame in&s;tant Se|lima recovered. "Ari&s;e, &s;aid Syndarac, and look round." We looked round; the darkne&s;s was &s;ud|denly di&s;&s;ipated, and we perceived our&s;elves in the road to Golconda, and the &s;pires of the city &s;park|ling before us. "Go, &s;aid he, Amurath, henceforth the hu&s;band of Selima, and the father of thy people! I have revealed thy &s;tory to Alibeg in a vi&s;ion; he expects thy return, and the chariots are come out to meet thee. Go, and I will proclaim before thee, Amurath the Sultan of the Ea&s;t, the Judge of Na|tions, the Taught of Heaven; Amurath, who&s;e ring is equal to the ring of Solomon, returns to reign with wi&s;dom, and diffu&s;e felicity." I now lifted up my eyes, and beheld the chariots coming forward. We were received by Alibeg with &s;enti|ments which could not be uttered, and by the peo|ple with the loude&s;t acclamation: Syndarac pro|claimed our return in thunder, that was heard thro' all the nations of my empire; and has prolonged my reign in pro&s;perity and peace.</P>
<P>For the world I have written, and by the world let what I write be remembered: for to none who hear of the Ring of Amurath, &s;hall its influence be wanting. Of this, is not thy heart a witne&s;s, thou who&s;e eye drinks in&s;truction from my pen? Ha&s;t thou' not a monitor who reproaches thee in &s;ecret when thy foot deviates from the path of virtue?
<PB N="207" REF="216">
Neglect not the fir&s;t whi&s;pers of this friend to thy &s;oul; it is the voice of a greater than Syndarac, to re&s;i&s;t who&s;e influence, is to invite de&s;truction.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE plea&s;ure I always take in writing to you, wherever I am and whatever doing, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
<PB N="208" REF="217">
di&s;pels my pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s; an unea&s;ine&s;s, cau&s;ed at once by the di&s;agreeable a&s;pect of every thing round me, and the more di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tances of the Count Alberti, with whom you were once acquainted. You remember him one of the gaye&s;t, mo&s;t agreeable per&s;ons at the court of Vienna, at once the example of men, and the favourite of the fair &s;ex. I often heard you repeat his name with e&s;teem, as one of the few that did honour to the pre&s;ent age, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genero&s;ity and pity in the highe&s;t degree, as one who made no other u&s;e of fortune but to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of man|kind. This gentleman, &s;ir, I wi&s;h I could &s;ay is now no more; yet too, unhappily for him, he exi&s;ts but in a &s;ituation more terrible than the mo&s;t gloomy imagination can conceive. After pa&s;&s;ing through &s;everal parts of the Alps, and having vi&s;ited Ger|many, I thought I could not well return home without vi&s;iting the quick&s;ilver mines at Idria, and &s;eeing tho&s;e dreadful &s;ubterraneous caverns, where thou&s;ands are condemned to re&s;ide, &s;hut out from all hopes of ever &s;eeing the chearful light of the &s;un, and obliged to toil out a mi&s;erable life, under the whips of impious ta&s;k-ma&s;ters. Imagine to your|&s;elf a hole on one &s;ide of a mountain, of about five yards over; down this you are conveyed in a kind of bucket, more than a hundred fathom, the pro&s;pect growing &s;till more gloomy, yet &s;till widening as you de&s;cend. At length, after &s;winging in terrible &s;u&s;|pence for &s;ome time in this precarious &s;ituation,
<PB N="209" REF="218">
you reach the bottom, and tread on the ground, which, by its hollow &s;ound under your feet, and the reverberations of the echo, &s;eems thundering at every &s;tep you take. In this gloomy and fright|ful &s;olitude, you are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the feeble gleam of lamps, here and there di&s;po&s;ed, &s;o as that the wretched inhabitants of the&s;e man&s;ions can go from one part to another, without a guide. And yet let me a&s;&s;ure you, that though they, by cu&s;tom, could &s;ee objects di&s;tinctly by the&s;e lights, I could &s;carce di&s;cern, for &s;ome time, any thing, not even the per|&s;on who accompanied me, to &s;hew the&s;e &s;cenes of horror. From this de&s;cription, I pre&s;ume, you have but a di&s;agreeable idea of the place, yet let me a&s;&s;ure you that it is a palace, if we compare the habitation with the inhabitants. Such wretches my eyes never before beheld. The blackne&s;s of their vi&s;ages &s;erves to conceal the horrid palene&s;s, cau&s;ed by the noxious qualities of the mineral they are em|ployed in procuring. As they in general con&s;i&s;t of malefactors condemned for life to this ta&s;k, they are fed at the public expence; but con&s;ume little provi&s;ion, for they lo&s;e their appetites in a &s;hort time, and commonly in about two years expire, from a total contraction of all the joints of the body. In this horrid man&s;ion I walked after my guide for &s;ome time, pondering on the &s;trange tyranny and avarice of mankind, when I was acco&s;ted by a voice behind, calling me by my name, and enquiring after my health with the mo&s;t cordial affection.
<PB N="210" REF="219">
I turned, and &s;aw a creature all black and hideous, who approached me, and with a mo&s;t piteous ac|cent crying, "Ah, Mr. Everard, do not you know me?" Good God! what was my &s;urprize, when, through the veil of his wretchedne&s;s, I di&s;co|vered the features of my old and dear friend Alberti. I flew to him with affection, and, after a tear of condolence, a&s;ked how he came there? To this he replied, that having fought a duel with a general of the Au&s;trian infantry, again&s;t the emperor's com|mand, and having left him for dead, he was obliged to fly into one of the fore&s;ts of I&s;tria, where he was fir&s;t taken, and afterwards &s;heltered by &s;ome ban|ditti, who had long infe&s;ted that quarter. With the&s;e he had lived for nine months, till by a clo&s;e inve&s;titure of the place in which they were con|cealed, and after a very ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, in which the greater part of them were killed, he was taken and carried to Vienna, in order to be broke alive upon the wheel. However, upon arriving at the capital, he was quickly known, and &s;everal of the a&s;&s;ociates of his accu&s;ation and danger witne&s;&s;ing his innocence, his puni&s;hment of the rack was changed into that of perpetual confinement and la|bour in the mines of Idria, a &s;entence, in my opi|nion, a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death. As Al|berti was giving me this account, a young woman who &s;eemed to be born for better fortune, came up to him: the dreadful &s;ituation &s;he was in was not able to de&s;troy her beauty, and even in this
<PB N="211" REF="220">
&s;cene of wretchedne&s;s, &s;he &s;eemed to have charms to grace the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;embly. This lady was in fact daughter to one of the fir&s;t families of Germany; and having tried every means to pro|cure her lover's pardon without effect, at la&s;t re|&s;olved to &s;hare tho&s;e mi&s;eries, which &s;he could not relieve. With him &s;he accordingly de&s;cended into the&s;e man&s;ions, from whence few of the living re|turn; with him &s;he was contented to live, forget|ting the gaieties of life; with him to toil, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;plendor of opulence; &s;atisfied with the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own con&s;tancy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t to you was expre&s;&s;ive, and, perhaps, too much &s;o, of the gloomy &s;tate of my mind. The deplorable &s;ituation of the worthy man de&s;cribed in it, was enough to add double horror to the hideous man&s;ion. At pre&s;ent, however, I have the happi|ness of informing you, that I was &s;pectator of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cene ever beheld. Nine days after I had written my la&s;t, a per&s;on came po&s;t from Vienna to the little village, near the mouth of the great Shaft. He was &s;oon after followed by a &s;econd, and then by a third. The enquiry was after the unfortunate count. Happening to overhear the demand, I gave them the nece&s;&s;ary information. Two of the&s;e were the brother and cou&s;in of the lady, the third was an intimate friend and fel|low-&s;oldier to the count. They came with his par|don, which had been procured by the general with whom the duel had been fought, and who was per|fectly recovered from his wounds. I led them with an expedition of joy down to his dreary abode, pre&s;ented to him his friends, and informed him of the happy change in his circum&s;tances. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the joy that brightened upon his grief-worn countenance, nor was the young lady's emotion le&s;s vivid at &s;eeing her friends, and hearing of her hu&s;band's freedom. Some hours
<PB N="213" REF="222">
were employed in repairing the appearance of this faithful couple; nor could I, without a tear, behold him taking leave of the wretched companions of his former toil. To one he gave his mattock, to another his working cloaths, to a third his little hou&s;hold uten&s;ils, &s;uch as had been nece&s;&s;ary to him in that &s;ituation. We &s;oon emerged from the mine, when he once again revi&s;ited the light of the &s;un, which he had totally de&s;paired of again &s;eeing. A po&s;t-chai&s;e and four was ready the next morning to take them to Vienna, where, as I am informed by a letter from him&s;elf, they arrived. The Empre&s;s has again taken him into favour; his fortune and rank are re&s;tored, and he and his fair partner have now the plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction of feeling happine&s;s with double reli&s;h, as they once knew what it was to be truly mi&s;erable.</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear, from the fir&s;t letter, I was &s;e|cretly very much di&s;turbed, becau&s;e I had rea&s;on to fear that the young lady, who&s;e conjugal fidelity I am &s;ure you all admire, was not the wife of Count Alberti. How happy am I to find my &s;u&s;picions were ill-founded! How re&s;pectable, how elevated was the conduct of that lady! Oh, my children, I would rather a thou&s;and times &s;ee you, like her, de|voted martyrs to duty and virtue, than to behold you emperors and queens.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The amiable virtues of this lady cannot certainly be either &s;poken or thought of too highly. But this is not all, children. As I mo&s;t earne&s;tly de|&s;ire you to imitate &s;uch bright examples of good|ne&s;s, &s;o likewi&s;e I would wi&s;h you to emulate tho&s;e who, joining indu&s;try to genius, have become fa|mous by their talents. To be active is &s;o natural and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to us, that we cannot be idle and be happy. Be&s;ides, it is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, while we live in &s;ociety, to contribute, by every means in our power, to the benefit of that &s;ociety. The pea&s;ant who tills the earth that we may eat, and the artizan who labours for our convenience, are truly re&s;pectable citizens; much, more &s;o, my
<PB N="215" REF="224">
children, than tho&s;e weak, narrow-minded per&s;ons, who, from the indu&s;try, abilities, or rapacity of their forefathers, find them&s;elves in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ac|cidental wealth and unmerited honour. Whoever &s;uppo&s;es that his power, his riches, or his rank, ex|empt him from labouring to promote the general good, becomes u&s;ele&s;s, contemptible, and vicious. Such adventitious aids give the means of becoming more eminently beneficial; and no one can be a good or a worthy man, who does not a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employ the advantages he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es for the public good. I am tran&s;ported almo&s;t beyond my&s;elf, my children, when I &s;peak or think on this &s;ubject. Patrioti&s;m, that is, the love not only of that parti|cular country where we were born, or exi&s;t, but of all countries and of all men, is &s;uch a noble, &s;uch a &s;uperb virtue, that I would wi&s;h you all to en|counter any danger, to brave any torture, rather than betray the cau&s;e of humanity, of liberty, and the rights of men. To under&s;tand the&s;e rights, to make them known, and to guard them, with a de|termined hand, &s;acred from violation, &s;hould be the inexorable re&s;olution of tho&s;e, who, by their opu|lence, have the lei&s;ure to &s;tudy, and the means to protect.</P>
<P>But I have been in&s;en&s;ibly led from the &s;ubject I intended to introduce; which was an account of Loui&s;a Darbach, a woman famous for her genius. Your mother wi&s;hed to give you more examples of con&s;picuous women. However, as I am ad|vanced
<PB N="216" REF="225">
thus far in de&s;cribing a duty &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the character of a good citizen, as that of true patrioti&s;m, I am &s;ure I &s;hall have her approbation of my endeavours to enforce this duty.</P>
<P>Numerous are the examples which both antient and modern hi&s;tory furni&s;h of this virtue: from the&s;e I will &s;elect two, which, in my opinion, are con|&s;picuou&s;ly great. The fir&s;t is the behaviour of Re|gulus, a man famous for the purity of his intentions and the integrity of his heart.</P>
<P>Regulus was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;ummate warrior that Rome could, in that age, produce. He was profe&s;&s;edly frugal and &s;evere, but le&s;s au&s;tere to others than to him&s;elf; he only re|prehended tho&s;e faults, which he would have died rather than have committed. His patrioti&s;m was &s;till greater than his temperance: all the private pa&s;&s;ions &s;eemed extingui&s;hed in him, or they were all &s;wallowed up in one great ruling affection, the love of his country. In the fir&s;t Punic war, he and Manlius were &s;ent by the Romans into Africa, to invade the territories of the Carthaginians, with the large&s;t fleet that had ever failed from an Italian port: this was met and engaged by another of the enemy's, equally, if not more, powerful. The battle was ob&s;tinate and de&s;perate; the Roman general, however, triumphed; he took fifty-four of the ene|my's &s;hips, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. The con&s;equence was, an immediate de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t of Africa,
<PB N="217" REF="226">
and the capture of the city Clupea, together with twenty thou&s;and men, who were made pri&s;oners of war. Manlius was then remanded back to Italy by the &s;enate, and Regulus ordered to remain and pro&s;ecute his victories in Africa; and when his con|&s;ul&s;hip was expired, he was continued general un|der the title of Procon&s;ul. Happy in the approba|tion of his country, Regulus per&s;evered in his ef|forts and his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and led his forces along the banks of the river Bagrada.</P>
<P>And here an incident happened, which, as it was very extraordinary, I &s;hall &s;top to relate. While he was waiting the approach of the Carthaginians, a &s;erpent of enormous &s;ize attacked his men as they went for water, and &s;eemed as if re&s;olved to guard the banks of the river. It was a hundred and twenty feet long, with &s;cales impenetrable to any weapon. Some of the bolde&s;t troops went up at fir&s;t to oppo&s;e its fury, but they &s;oon fell victims to their ra&s;hne&s;s, being either killed by its devouring jaws, or cru&s;hed to pieces by the windings of its tail. The poi&s;onous vapour that i&s;&s;ued from it, made it &s;till more formidable; and the men were &s;o much terrified at its appearance, that they a&s;&s;erted they would much more joyfully face the whole Car|thaginian army. For &s;ome time it &s;eemed uncer|tain which &s;hould remain ma&s;ters of the river, as from the hardne&s;s of its &s;cales no ordinary efforts could drive it away. At la&s;t Regulus was obliged to make u&s;e of the machines employed in battering
<PB N="218" REF="227">
down the walls of cities. Notwith&s;tanding this, the &s;erpent, for a long time, with&s;tood all his efforts, and de&s;troyed numbers of his men; but at length a very large &s;tone, which was flung from an engine, happened to break its &s;pine, and de&s;troyed its motion. By the&s;e means the &s;oldiers &s;urrounded and killed it. Regulus, not le&s;s plea&s;ed with his victory than if he had gained a battle, ordered its &s;kin to be &s;ent to Rome, where it continued to be &s;een in the time of Pliny.</P>
<P>After this he engaged the Carthaginians, defeated and cut off &s;ome of their be&s;t troops, and took above eighty of their towns; while they, in de&s;pair, were obliged to &s;end to Lacedemon for a general capable of oppo&s;ing Regulus; at the &s;ame time di&s;patching &s;ome of the principal men of the &s;tate to him, to &s;ue for a peace.</P>
<P>The Roman general had long wi&s;hed to termi|nate the war, and go back to his native country. He had even &s;ent to the &s;enate &s;ome time before, demanding a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and leave to return, in con|&s;equence of an account he had received, informing him that his &s;teward who cultivated his farm, which con&s;i&s;ted but of &s;even acres, was dead, and that his &s;ervant had &s;tolen all the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry that were u&s;ed in its cultivation. He informed the &s;enate, that while he was leading on the armies of the &s;tate, his wife and children were in danger of wanting bread, and that his little dome&s;tic affairs required his pre&s;ence at home. The &s;enate upon
<PB N="219" REF="228">
this ordered his wife and children a &s;ufficient main|tenance, furni&s;hed his farm with proper in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, at the public expence, and gave him orders to continue at the head of the army.</P>
<P>The negociation for peace between the nations not &s;ucceeding, the Carthaginians committed the war to the care of Xantippus, the Spartan general, a man of con&s;ummate knowledge in the art of war: and Regulus was at la&s;t, after all his victories, de|feated and taken pri&s;oner. And now was the time in which the virtues of Regulus &s;hone forth with &s;till &s;uperior lu&s;tre. The affairs of the Carthagi|nians after this battle became more &s;ucce&s;sful, but &s;till they were de&s;irous of a peace, and made new propo&s;als, not doubting but they &s;hould obtain bet|ter terms than tho&s;e in&s;i&s;ted on before by the Ro|mans. They therefore re&s;olved to &s;end to Rome to accompli&s;h this bu&s;ine&s;s, or at lea&s;t to procure an exchange of pri&s;oners. For this purpo&s;e they &s;uppo&s;ed that Regulus, whom they had now for four years kept in a dungeon, confined and chained, would be a proper &s;olicitor. It was expected that, being wearied with impri&s;onment and bondage, he would gladly endeavour to per&s;uade his countrymen to a di&s;continuance of the war, which only prolong|ed his captivity. He was accordingly &s;ent, with their amba&s;&s;adors, to Rome, but with a promi&s;e, previou&s;ly exacted from him, to return in ca&s;e of being un&s;ucce&s;sful. He was even given to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="220" REF="229">
that his life depended upon the &s;ucce&s;s of his expedition.</P>
<P>When this old general, together with the am|ba&s;&s;adors of Carthage, approached Rome, numbers of his friends came out to meet him, and congra|tulate his return. Their acclamations re&s;ounded through the city, but Regulus refu&s;ed, with &s;ettled melancholy, to enter the gates. It was in vain that he was intreated, on every &s;ide, to vi&s;it once more his little dwelling, and &s;hare in that joy which his return had in&s;pired. He per&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying, that he was now but a &s;lave belonging to the Carthagi|nians, and unfit to partake in the liberal honours of his country. The &s;enate a&s;&s;embling without the walls, as u&s;ual, to give audience to the amba&s;&s;adors, Regulus opened his commi&s;&s;ion, as he had been di|rected by the Carthaginian coun&s;el, and their am|ba&s;&s;adors &s;econded his propo&s;als. The &s;enate were, by this time, them&s;elves weary of a war which had been protracted above eight years, and were no way di&s;inclinable to peace. It &s;eemed the general opi|nion, that the enmity between the two &s;tates had continued too long; and that no terms &s;hould be refu&s;ed, which might give not only re&s;t to the two nations, but liberty to an old brave general, whom the people reverenced and loved. It only remained for Regulus him&s;elf to give his opinion, who, when it came to his turn to &s;peak, to the &s;urprize of all the world, gave his voice for continuing the war. He a&s;&s;ured the &s;enate, that the Carthaginian re|&s;ources
<PB N="221" REF="230">
were now almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, the populace harra&s;&s;ed out with fatigues, and their nobles with contention: that all their be&s;t generals were pri|&s;oners with the Romans, while Carthage had none but the refu&s;e of the Roman army: that not only the intere&s;t of Rome, but its honour was al&s;o con|cerned in continuing the war, for their ance&s;tors had never made peace till they were victorious.</P>
<P>So unexpected an advice not a little di&s;turbed the &s;enate: they &s;aw the ju&s;tice of his opinion, but they al&s;o &s;aw the danger he incurred by giving it: they &s;eemed entirely &s;atisfied of the expediency of pro|longing the war; their only ob&s;tacle was, how to &s;ecure the &s;afety of him who had advi&s;ed its conti|nuance: they pitied as well as admired a man who had u&s;ed &s;uch eloquence again&s;t his private intere&s;t, and could not conclude upon a mea&s;ure which was to terminate in his ruin. Regulus, however, &s;oon relieved their embarra&s;&s;ment, by breaking off the treaty, and ri&s;ing in order to return to his bonds and confinement. It was in vain that the &s;enate and all his deare&s;t friends intreated his &s;tay; he &s;till refu&s;ed their &s;olicitations. Maria, his wife, with her little children, filled the city with her lamenta|tions, and vainly implored to be permitted to &s;ee him: he &s;till ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in keeping his promi&s;e; and though &s;ufficiently apprized of the torture's that awaited his return, without embracing his family, or taking leave of his friends, he de|parted, with the amba&s;&s;adors, for Carthage.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="231">When the Carthaginians were informed of their ill-&s;ucce&s;s, and the rea&s;on of it, by their amba&s;&s;adors, their rage and di&s;appointment rendered them inexor|ably furious; and Regulus died, as he expected, by the implacable hand of &s;tudied torment and lingering cruelty.</P>

<P>I approve your emulative &s;pirit, William, but beware that it does not take an improper turn. 'Twere &s;upreme happine&s;s rather to &s;ink into eter|nal oblivion, than to be remembered for our vices or our crimes. There is another thing, my chil|dren, which I wi&s;h you to remark; the patrioti&s;m of Regulus extended only to his own country; it was not that universal philanthropy which I am en|deavouring to inculcate. The love of our country &s;hould make us freely devote our lives and fortunes
<PB N="223" REF="232">
to protect it from the tyranny of ambitious ma|gi&s;trates, or the a&s;&s;aults of rival nations; but it &s;hould never in&s;tigate that partial and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;pirit, which lu&s;ts for dominion, and triumphs only to extirpate. The advice of Scipio Na&s;&s;ica was not only humane, but it was wi&s;e. Cato, the cen&s;or, and many other Roman &s;enators were perpetually engaging the people to de&s;troy Charthage. Scipio bade them beware of that pernicious coun&s;el; "era&s;e Car|thage, &s;aid he, and where &s;hall Rome find a rival? her military di&s;cipline mu&s;t either become feeble by di&s;u&s;e, or be exerci&s;ed to her own de&s;truction." This prophecy was afterwards too fatally fulfilled.</P>

<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, William, it is one among the many black and indelible &s;pots in the annals of human nature.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, my children, introduce a patriot to you, &s;uperior even to Regulus, though never likely to be &s;o celebrated; a poor Armenian, who beheld the wi&s;dom, knowledge, and arts of the Europeans, and the comparative ignorance of his own country, with an anxiety of patrioti&s;m that rai&s;es him to the very fir&s;t rank of men. But I will not attempt to give you the character of my hero; I am un|equal
<PB N="224" REF="233">
to the ta&s;k; his own letters will do it more effectually than the eloquence of an angel. He was a foreigner, and there are con&s;equently defects in his &s;tile, which the intent and &s;pirit of them will induce you to overlook. His fir&s;t letter was ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Earl, now Duke, of Northumberland, who patronized and recommended him to the late Duke of Cumberland, by whom he was &s;ent to &s;tudy in the academy at Woolwich; his &s;econd to Prince Heraclius, his &s;overeign. Now read them, William; and learn, my &s;ons, endeavour, my chil|dren, to catch a portion of his divine &s;pirit.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I pre&s;ent you the &s;pecimen of my writing I pro|mi&s;ed. It is too bold, I am afraid, to make my|&s;elf the &s;ubject, when I write for your lord&s;hip; but forgive, my lord, the language of a &s;tranger: I have been in too low condition to know how to write proper to your lord&s;hip; but you &s;peak to me more kind and humble than mean peo|ple; &s;o I am encouraged. I have very good de|&s;igns, and I have &s;uffered very much hard&s;hips for them. I think your lord&s;hip will not de&s;pi&s;e a per|&s;on in a mean condition, for thinking of &s;omething more than livelihood; I have, with a good will, thrown behind me a very ea&s;y livelihood for this
<PB N="225" REF="234">
condition, mean as it is; and I am not troubled if I can carry my point at la&s;t. As long as I can re|member my own family, and I remember my great grandfathers, they have been always &s;oldiers, and always did remember Chri&s;t, though they were torn out of their country of Armenia, by Shaw Abbas, and planted in Hamadan. After their captivity they were &s;oldiers likewi&s;e. Two of my uncles did &s;pill their blood in the &s;ervice of Kouly Kan: my father was his &s;lave for many years; but he was at la&s;t forced to fly into India, becau&s;e this tyrant had &s;harpened his battle-ax again&s;t his own army more than upon his enemies. Soon after my father &s;ent for me to Calcutta, in Bengal, where he is a mer|chant. There I &s;aw the fort of Europeans, and the &s;oldiers exerci&s;e, and the &s;hipping, and that they were dexterous and perfect in all things. Then I grieved within my&s;elf for my religion and my coun|try, that we were in &s;lavery and ignorance, like Jews, vagabonds over the earth; and I &s;poke to my father upon all this; becau&s;e our fathers did not fight for their country; but I under&s;tood that the Armenians in the mountains were free, and handled arms from their childhood; and that tho&s;e under Patriarch, who are &s;ubject to the Turks and Per|&s;ians, did not want courage; but they are all ig|norant, and fight only with a wild and natural fierceness, and &s;o they have no order, and do no|thing but like robbers. And I re&s;olved I would go to Europe to learn art military, and other &s;ciences
<PB N="226" REF="235">
to a&s;&s;i&s;t that art; and I was &s;ure that if I could go into Armenia, like an European officer, I may be u&s;eful at la&s;t in &s;ome degree to my country; but my father did not li&s;ten to me, for God did not give him under&s;tanding in the&s;e things. I could not bear to live like a bea&s;t, eating and drinking, without li|berty or knowledge:&mdash;I went to captain Fox, of the &s;hip Walpole, and ki&s;&s;ed his feet hundred times, to let me work for my pa&s;&s;age to Europe, before he Would bend to me; but he did at la&s;t admit me; and I came to England with much labour; but it did not grieve me when I thought of my country: I entered my&s;elf with my little money into Mr. Mid|dleton's academy: I had the honour to tell your lord&s;hip &s;o before: I was fir&s;t a &s;cholar, and, when my money was gone, I was a &s;ervant there for my learning; but he was broke, and I lo&s;t every thing. I went into the &s;treet to work for my bread, for I could not bear to go about wagging a tail at people's doors for a bit of meat. I will not grieve your lord|&s;hip with the mi&s;ery which I went through; I do not want to be pitied. I got &s;ervice at la&s;t as a porter with one Mr. Robarts, a grocer in the city: in this time I carried &s;ometimes burthens of near two hun|dred weight upon my back, and paid out of my wages to learn &s;ome geometry, and to compleat my&s;elf in writing, and ju&s;t to begin a little French; but becau&s;e, my lord, I almo&s;t &s;tarved my&s;elf to pay for this, and carried burthens more than my &s;trength, I hurted my&s;elf &s;o that I could not work any longer;
<PB N="227" REF="236">
&s;o that I was in de&s;pair, and not care what become of me: but a friend put me to write with one Mr. Web&s;ter, an attorney in Cheap&s;ide, which for a little time got bread; but I was re&s;olved, in de&s;pair, to go again to India, becau&s;e nobody would put out his hand to help me to learn; and my uncle &s;ent 60 pounds to governor Davis to carry me back. I am afraid I am too trouble&s;ome in my accounts to your lord&s;hip; but we people of A&s;ia cannot &s;ay little in a great deal, like &s;cholars. Now I met by chance &s;ome gentlemen who encouraged me, and gave me books to read, and advi&s;ed me to ki&s;s colonel Dingley's hands, and &s;hew my bu&s;ine&s;s to him. He was a brave &s;oldier, took me by the hand, &s;poke to his own &s;erjeant, an hone&s;t man, to teach me manual exerci&s;e, and gave me Bland's Military Di&s;cipline, and promi&s;ed to help me to learn gunnery and forti|fication; but I was again unfortuned; for when light ju&s;t began to come to my eyes, he died, and I was like before, except that I knew a little of manual exerci&s;e, and read &s;ome of the Roman hi&s;tory; could learn no more nor live. I was broke to pieces, and bowed my neck to governor Davis, to go over to my friends, without doing any of the&s;e things I &s;uffered for. I am in this net at pre&s;ent; but I am happier than all mankind, if I can meet any great man who can prevail upon governor Davis to allow me &s;ome|thing out of the money he has only upon condition that I return to blindne&s;s once again; that I may go through evolutions with the recruits, and learn
<PB N="228" REF="237">
gunnery and fortification, and if there is war, to go one year as a volunteer. If governor Davis writes, that I have a great man here my protector, my father, who looks upon me as a per&s;on run away and for|&s;aken, will make me an allowance to learn. If I could clear my own eyes, and &s;erve my country and my religion, that is trod under the foot of Mu&s;&s;ulman, I would go through all &s;lavery and danger with a glad heart; but if I mu&s;t return, after four years &s;lavery and mi&s;ery, to the &s;ame ignorance, without doing any good, would break my heart, my lord, in the end. I beg pardon, I have experience of your lord&s;hip's goodne&s;s, el&s;e I would not &s;ay &s;o much; I would not receive, but return; and I want no|thing but a little &s;peaking from the authority of an Indian governor to my friends. I have always been hone&s;t. Tho&s;e I have been &s;lave to will &s;ay I am hone&s;t. Mr. Grey tru&s;ted me.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;ort of &s;tory nothing but your lord&s;hip's good nature can make tolerable. I am much obliged to your lord&s;hip for your patience. I &s;hall be very proud of giving your lord&s;hip all the proof in my power, how much I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. To the mo&s;t &s;hining, mo&s;t chri&s;tian, King HERA|CLIUS, of Georgia and Armenia.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My King,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL things that have been made, from the be|ginning of the world to this day, are by the will of God, according to the New Te&s;tament. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made. God created the hea|ven and the earth, the &s;ea and the land; and it is He that made you king over two nations, Armeni|ans and Georgians. Glory be to God the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that made you defender and protector of tho&s;e Chri&s;tian nations, and of their faith, who have been many hundred years under the hands of Per&s;ian unbelievers; and being now deli|vered by the mighty hands of your maje&s;ty, the &s;ame God will al&s;o, I hope, deliver tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, who are under the hands of Othomans; for there is no difficulty in the mighty hands of God; and who&s;oever tru&s;t in Him, &s;hall not be a&s;hamed. It was He that delivered I&s;rael, by the hand of the prophet Mo&s;es, out of the hands of Pharaoh, and fed them with manna, according to the holy P&s;alms, which faith, Men did eat the bread of angels.

<P><PB N="230" REF="239">Again, having heard the &s;ame of your maje&s;ty's brave conque&s;t, by which you have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the two ancient kingdoms of Armenia and Georgia, and that they are at pre&s;ent under your maje&s;ty's pro|tection, being de&s;irous, from the readine&s;s of my &s;oul, to offer your maje&s;ty my &s;ervice, which I hope you will make no difficulty to accept, as money is far from the de&s;ire of your maje&s;ty's &s;ervant, who wi&s;hes nothing but to &s;erve him who has the rule over his nation; for, while I am here, I want no|thing: I have a great friend here, and that great friend is my protector; and that protector is the &s;on of the king of England.

<P>Your maje&s;ty has heard of the German nation, who, with no more than twenty thou&s;and men, are able to give battle to a hundred thou&s;and Maho|metans, or Turks, enemies to the Chri&s;tian na|tions. I would al&s;o acquaint your maje&s;ty, how it is, or by what means, that the European nations are &s;uch conquerors, and &s;o brave warriors. It is a rule among them, that whoever is de&s;irous to be|come a warrior, fir&s;t, he is obliged to enter him|&s;elf into the hou&s;e of exerci&s;e, which they call it
<PB N="231" REF="400">
here, an academy to learn or to &s;tudy, four or five years, the art of war, that is to &s;ay, to learn the art of building &s;trong ca&s;tles, the like of which are not to be found in all A&s;ia; and al&s;o the art of ma|naging great guns in &s;uch a manner, as none of our fortifications could &s;tand before them for three days; likewi&s;e, the manner of encamping with judgment, and the way of ranging of the &s;oldiers, &s;o that they are like a wall of iron, not to be broken; and, after having thoroughly compleated his &s;tudy in that art, leaves the place, goes and offers him&s;elf and his &s;ervice to his prince or king, thereby becomes an officer, or fighter for his king and country; and by long experience perfects him&s;elf in that great art; for the art of war here is not to be under&s;tood ea&s;ily; it contains many things difficult to be known, and very much preferable to the practice of Turks and Per&s;ians. See, O mighty king, it is not by &s;trength of arm, that the&s;e nations are called con|querors, but by wi&s;dom and art. Here every thing is by art and wi&s;dom; for without wi&s;dom the land is not land; and the nations that dwell therein are blind and unhappy. According to the Old Te&s;ta|ment, which faith, God made the heaven and the earth by his infinite wi&s;dom; therefore God loveth wi&s;dom for this rea&s;on. I &s;ay, who&s;oever followeth wi&s;dom, he is dear, or beloved of God; for from wi&s;dom proceedeth all manner of goodne&s;s; al&s;o, a man is not mighty without wi&s;dom, nor wi&s;e with|out righteou&s;ne&s;s. The ancient Romans, who were
<PB N="232" REF="241">
&s;o great, gave laws, and &s;ubdued all nations of the world: this was by art and wi&s;dom, before our Sa|viour, although they were heathens and idolaters; but they were virtuous, and lived in good morals. Another example, Peter the Great, of Ru&s;&s;ia, who could not be &s;o great a warrior, and his country could never have been &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, and flouri&s;hed, had not he come over here to learn wi&s;dom, who, when he was in Holland, &s;erved in a place of &s;hip-build|ing, like one of the labourers, and humbled him&s;elf therein: who&s;oever humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be ex|alted, &amp;c. And when he returned into his own country, he was full of all manner of wi&s;dom, by which he made him&s;elf father, as well as lord and king, over his country. The&s;e are things which have made the people of Europe to be conquerors, and to be e&s;teemed more wi&s;e than all the nations upon the face of the earth; for among&s;t them are learned men, who &s;tudy the way in which God has made all things according to their nature, by which they are able to do things of great wonder and u&s;e|fulne&s;s. They &s;end likewi&s;e into every part of the world, at a great expence, for to learn all things that are produced upon or under the earth, by which they are increa&s;ed in wi&s;dom and riches; their ci|ties are very great, their people are very happy, not being afraid of famine or dangers, and they are un|der excellent laws, by which no man is &s;uffered to do wrong to another, though he is weak or poor. But this nation, this great and mighty nation, O my
<PB N="233" REF="242">
king! where I live, is not only a great and wi&s;e na|tion, but al&s;o de&s;troyers of the devourers of man|kind. I am &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, that even the &s;heep in this country re&s;t in quietne&s;s without the lea&s;t fear of wolves. May the great God grant your ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects to follow their examples, to grow wi&s;e and conquerors, under the wi&s;dom and cou|rage of your maje&s;ty, to whom God grant long life, to trample your enemies like du&s;t under your feet.</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your maje&s;ty to know who your &s;ervant is, that rai&s;es his head to &s;peak to you, and takes pains to know the&s;e things with much labour, for your maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, to whom God grant vic|tory. The name of your &s;ervant is Emin, the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, the &s;on of Michael, the &s;on of Gregory, who is de&s;cended from Emin, who, in the day when Armenia was broke under the battle-axe of Shaw Abbas, was Minba&s;hy in his country; but he was made captive, with others, and was carried into Per&s;ia, and placed at Hamadan; from him your ma|je&s;ty's &s;ervant is come, and he is called of his name, being born at Hamadan; but our captivity was grievous under the Per&s;ians, who, &s;ince Mahome|tani&s;m, which is well known to your maje&s;ty, are grown quite barbarians, not being &s;o civilized as they were in antient times, (according to the hi&s;|tories I have read in this ble&s;&s;ed i&s;land) &s;o that my father flew from Hamadan, in the time of Shaw Thamas Kouly Kan, into India, to a place called Calcutta, where the Engli&s;h have a fort, and &s;ol|diers,
<PB N="234" REF="243">
and a great trade, though their country is &s;even months voyage from Bengal; there my father made him&s;elf a merchant to this day; and would have made me &s;uch as him&s;elf, but I did not &s;ubmit to him; for I enquired of my fathers from my in|fancy, the rea&s;on why we were per&s;ecuted by infi|dels? and why we did re&s;ide &s;o contemptibly among&s;t lawle&s;s nations? but they made me no an&s;wer, and my heart was grieved, and I had none to comfort me in my griefs; for I &s;aid, the ants that creep upon the earth have a king, and we have not; and the nations of all countries make their laugh upon us, al&s;o per&s;ecuting, &s;aying to us, that you are ma&s;ter-le&s;s; you have no king of your own, and that you re&s;emble the Jews &s;cattered upon the face of the earth; you have no love for one another; you are without honour; and by the di&s;unity of your na|tion, all the nations in&s;ult you; you are contempti|ble, and without zeal; and you are as great lovers of money, as the heathens did love their gods. I could not bear all the&s;e reflections, whil&s;t I grieved, and found none to heal me. I ob&s;erved watchfully the Europeans, their wi&s;e cu&s;toms, and their &s;hip|ping, far better both for &s;ailing and for war, than the &s;hips of the Indians; and above all, the prac|tice of their &s;oldiers, who, if they were thou&s;ands of men, by one word of command from their officers, in&s;tantly all together move and act, as if they were one man. Then I thought in my mind, that it was God that had put it in my heart to think on all
<PB N="235" REF="244">
things. Therefore, I &s;poke not to my father, but had hopes in my heart, that if I went to England, I &s;hould learn the art of war, and I was encourag|ed, for I then heard a little, and not much of your maje&s;ty's name, until I came here, where I learned that your maje&s;ty was e&s;tabli&s;hed in your kingdom, and had routed a great army of Per&s;ians. See! O my king, what great thing the wi&s;dom is, by which this nation know our country better than we do; and that this nation are awake, and we are a&s;leep. On board the &s;hip I worked like a &s;ailor; and after|wards, when I came here, was &s;o reduced, that I was forced by hunger, to offer my&s;elf to &s;ale upon the Exchange, to be &s;ent into the new world. Oh! my king, do not pity Me; no, not even at that time when you hear, or &s;ee me &s;acrificed in your &s;ervice, but pity tho&s;e &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, who de|&s;erve pity; but the omnipotent God &s;aved me by the hands of an Engli&s;hman; and the &s;ame God who heard the crying of my heart, did put it into the heart of a generous nobleman, who is one of the pillars of the throne of England, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. He made me right in the coun&s;el of my heart; he made me known to the &s;on of the king of England; he &s;ent me to the place of education, where I learnt the art of war, according to wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>My ambition is to lay my knowledge at the feet of your maje&s;ty, and to &s;erve you in the be&s;t of my ability. For know, O my king, that what is not built on knowledge, though it is very &s;trong and
<PB N="236" REF="245">
lofty, is as if it were built upon &s;and; therefore, my purpo&s;e is, to go well in&s;tructed into your maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and to carry with me men &s;kilful in all things, (if you give me encouragement,) to &s;trength|en and poli&s;h your kingdom, like the kingdoms of Europe: for you have a good country, and com|mand over many brave men; and if you could ga|ther the Armenians, a rich and trading people, who are &s;cattered to the ea&s;t, and the we&s;t, and the north, and the &s;outh, under the protection of your maje&s;ty's arms in your own country, no kingdom in the ea&s;t would be like your kingdom, for riches and glory. May the eternal God, the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;harpen your &s;cymitar upon all your ene|mies, and &s;trengthen the wri&s;t of your maje&s;ty's right hand, to protect our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed nation, accord|ing to the wi&s;hes and labours of your &s;ervant.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; a writer like our friend Plutarch would draw a number of parallel circum&s;tances. When I intended to introduce this &s;ubject to you, my children, I purpo&s;ed to inform you of the great e&s;ti|mation, in which learning and learned men have ever been held, and this I &s;hall now re&s;ume. As a &s;pur to your indu&s;try in this particular, I mu&s;t in|form &s;uch of you as have not made the ob&s;ervation your&s;elves, that to be illiterate now among people of a certain rank, is to be de&s;pi&s;ed. I would by no means per&s;uade you to become writers, unle&s;s you feel an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, and find that tho&s;e who&s;e judgment is e&s;tabli&s;hed approve your efforts, and encourage you to proceed. Then, if with energy and genius you can by your writings warm the heart, and incite it to virtue, I know no character more u&s;eful, more re&s;pectable, or which I would rather &s;ee you a&s;&s;ume. But this is a difficult ta&s;k, and only to be accompli&s;hed by a few.</P>
<P>The ju&s;t renown which has been acquired by the exertions of genius, affords a plea&s;ing retro&s;pect to the emulative mind. Barbarians, kings, and con|querors, have given the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timonies of re&s;pect to learning. "I dwelt, faith Martinius,
<PB N="239" REF="248">
in the city of Venxus, when it was &s;acked by the Tartars. I fixed over the faire&s;t gate of my hou&s;e a red paper, long and broad, with an in&s;cription, &s;ignifying, HERE DWELLS THE EUROPEAN DOC|TOR OF THE DIVINE LAW.&mdash;At the entrance of the great hall I placed my large&s;t and be&s;t bound books, my mathematical and optical in&s;truments, &amp;c. by which means I not only e&s;caped the violence and plunder of the common &s;oldiers, but was ca|re&s;&s;ed by the Tartarian viceroy."</P>
<P>When Alexander the Great found among the &s;poils of Darius a ca&s;ket of ine&s;timable workman|&s;hip, embelli&s;hed with gold, pearls, and precious &s;tones, he kept it as a ca&s;e for the works of Homer.</P>
<P>When Menander, the comic poet, travelled be|tween Egypt and Macedon, he was attended by am|ba&s;&s;adors and a fleet, the kings of the&s;e places think|ing they could never do him &s;ufficient honour.</P>
<P>Magdalene, wife of Lewis XI. of France, when &s;he &s;aw Alanus fa&s;t a&s;leep, who was an old hard-favoured, but learned man, &s;he approached &s;oftly and ki&s;&s;ed him. The ladies that attended her laugh|ed, but &s;he replied, "It is not his per&s;on I bear this reverence and re&s;pect to, but the divine beauty of his &s;oul."</P>
<P>The&s;e kind of in&s;tances, my children, are almo&s;t innumerable: however, I &s;hall only cite another, and that, becau&s;e it contains a pathetic de&s;cription of the death of a mo&s;t extraordinary and celebrated man. This was Archimedes, the mathematician,
<PB N="240" REF="249">
who by the profundity of his knowledge, and the inexhau&s;tible re&s;ources of his imagination, defended the ill-fortified city of Syracu&s;e again&s;t a mo&s;t pow|erful fleet and army. This city was deemed inde|fen&s;ible, and its riches were known to be immen&s;e; the Romans &s;at down before it, therefore, with the expectation of a &s;peedy &s;urrender and prodigious plunder. Archimedes alone &s;u&s;pended its fate. He de&s;troyed their men: he demoli&s;hed their &s;hipping. He &s;o united the powers of mechani&s;m, that he rai&s;ed their ve&s;&s;els into the air, and then let them da&s;h to pieces by the violence of their fall. He made u&s;e of burning-gla&s;&s;es, which, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome hundred yards, &s;et the Roman &s;hips and wooden towers on fire. At la&s;t, however, the town was taken, on a great fe&s;tival, by &s;urprize, and the in|habitants put to the &s;word. Previous to the &s;ac|cage, Marcellus, the Roman general, had given &s;trict orders to &s;pare Archimedes, but cruel and in|exorable de&s;tiny had otherwi&s;e decreed. A Roman &s;oldier had broke into his hou&s;e, with his &s;word drawn, and demanded who he was. Archimedes, intent probably upon &s;ome new di&s;covery, and an|xious to pre&s;erve a mathematical figure, which he had drawn in the du&s;t, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the &s;ol|dier's que&s;tion, called out to him not to &s;poil his circle. The warrior under&s;tood not circles; he thought him&s;elf &s;corned, and ran Archimedes thro' the body!</P>

<HEAD>EMULATION. An Account of Madam LOUISA DARBACH, a famous German Poete&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prodigy in the literary world was born in the year 1722, upon the borders of Lower Sile&s;ia, between Zulichau and Cro&s;&s;en, at a &s;mall hamlet called Nammer. Her father, being a brewer and alehou&s;e-keeper, was the principal of &s;even poor in|habitants, but died whil&s;t &s;he was &s;till a child, not above &s;even years old. Her grandmother's brother, an old man of good under&s;tanding, who lived in Po|land, had taken her home to his hou&s;e a few months before this happened, and taught her to read and write. This is the uncle to whom one of the poems in the printed collection is addre&s;&s;ed. She conti|nued with him about three years, and then returned to her mother. The misfortunes which con&s;tantly attended her, until &s;he was near forty, began at this period. Her fir&s;t employment was the care of her infant brother; but &s;he &s;oon quitted that, in order to attend upon three cows, which was her pa|rent's whole &s;tock. The fir&s;t &s;igns of her natural inclination to poetry had then ju&s;t made their ap|pearance, by an uncommon de&s;ire to &s;ing. She knew a hundred church hymns by heart, and &s;ung them at her work, or whil&s;t watching the cattle. Her inclination &s;oon prompted her to write ver&s;es,
<PB N="242" REF="251">
but &s;he does not at pre&s;ent recollect any part of that fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of her uncultivated genius, which was ac|cidentally a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a neighbouring &s;hepherd, who, although &s;eparated by a &s;mall river, continued ne|verthele&s;s to lend her a few books. Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, the A&s;iatic Bani&s;e, a German romance, and the Arabian Nights Entertainment, compo&s;ed the whole of her library. She read the&s;e with great plea&s;ure, and her time pa&s;&s;ed away very agreeably. But this happine&s;s was &s;oon at an end, being obliged to return to her former attendance upon children; with which, and other laborious employments of a &s;ervant, &s;he reached her &s;eventeenth year. Her next &s;tep was matrimony; and the hu&s;band her mother provided her, being a wool-comber by pro|fe&s;&s;ion, obliged her to prepare all the wool which he u&s;ed; be&s;ides which &s;he had the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e to manage, and could find no time to in|dulge her natural propen&s;ity to writing ver&s;es and reading, except a few hours on a Sunday, but took that opportunity to write down the poems &s;he had compo&s;ed at her work. After having been married nine years, &s;he was relea&s;ed from this drudgery by the death of her hu&s;band; but her mother &s;oon en|gaged her to another, who was much wor&s;e than the former. This was the mo&s;t unfortunate part of her whole life, as &s;he felt with this &s;econd hu&s;band all the hard&s;hips of an unhappy marriage, and great poverty. But even in the&s;e circum&s;tances nature had a &s;urprizing influence over the genius of our
<PB N="243" REF="252">
poete&s;s. She got to the &s;ight of &s;ome poems writ|ten by a clergyman, named Schonemann, who is well known at Berlin to have been at times affected, after a violent fever, with a &s;ort of madne&s;s, during which he always &s;poke and preached in ver&s;e: although the bulk of this extraordinary man's performances rather indicated a di&s;ordered imagination, than the in&s;piration of the Mu&s;es; our poete&s;s found never|thele&s;s in tho&s;e &s;he &s;aw &s;omething which greatly excited her genius.</P>
<P>She now became more de&s;irous than ever to fol|low the natural bent of her di&s;po&s;ition, but wanted both time and opportunity: &s;he was, however, at la&s;t encouraged by &s;everal per&s;ons to proceed, and particularly by Profe&s;&s;or Meyer, of Halle, who was no otherwi&s;e acquainted with her, than by having &s;een one of her poems. In gratitude to her fir&s;t patrons and benefactors, who were chiefly inhabi|tants of Tran&s;tadt, in Poland, the place where &s;he then re&s;ided, &s;he mentions their names in the pre|face. M. Korber, of Great Li&s;&s;a, was the fir&s;t who committed any of her performances to the pre&s;s. The&s;e productions of her genius were only &s;mall &s;parks of that half-extingui&s;hed fire, which the Mu&s;es had kindled in her. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's victories gave her force to overcome all ob&s;tacles, and the flames which had till then been &s;mothered, blazed out at once. She removed to Great Glogau in the year 1755, with her hu&s;band and children, and gaining admittance to a book|&s;eller's
<PB N="244" REF="253">
&s;hop, read many poetical and other perform|ances with much plea&s;ure, but without any order or &s;ettled plan. The u&s;e Mrs. Darbach has made of this cur&s;ory reading, and how ea&s;ily &s;he retained the mo&s;t material parts, appear throughout her poems. She has only read a few books, and tho&s;e with great expedition; but any per&s;on unacquainted with the real fact, would naturally imagine the contrary. The remarkable war which ended in 1764, and her &s;overeign's exploits, di&s;played at large the poetical genius of this extraordinary per|&s;on. The battle of Lowo&s;chutz gave occa&s;ion to her fir&s;t triumphant ode; and &s;he &s;oon afterwards peru&s;ed the military &s;ongs of a Pru&s;&s;ian grenadier, &s;ome of Ramler's odes, and Mrs. Unzer's poems. Her &s;ub&s;equent productions on the occa&s;ion of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's victories, plainly &s;hew the effect they had upon her, and are proofs of a poetical ge|nius already come to maturity. Our poete&s;s con|tinued &s;till, however, oppre&s;&s;ed with poverty; but Providence was plea&s;ed at la&s;t to relea&s;e her from her very deplorable &s;tate, under which few would have been able to have &s;upported them&s;elves. Baron Cott|witz, a Sile&s;ian nobleman, who has long been celebrat|ed for many amiable qualifications, became acquaint|ed with her in 1760, as he was travelling through Glogau. His charitable di&s;po&s;ition pitied her di&s;|tre&s;s, relieved her from it, and carried her to Berlin. She &s;oon became acquainted with &s;everal men of learning, and judges of poetry: her genius then
<PB N="245" REF="254">
&s;hewed it&s;elf in the greate&s;t lu&s;tre; &s;he was uni|ver&s;ally admired; and it is now her happine&s;s to be care&s;&s;ed at the court of a prince, who&s;e characteri&s;tic it is, to be at once the judge and patron of genius. Mo&s;t of the poems in the pre&s;ent collection have been compo&s;ed &s;ince, and fully explain her cha|racter, and the latter occurrences of her life. To the above account, it may not be improper to add a few remarks concerning Madam Darbach's ge|nius, made by the editor in the preface to the col|lection of her poems, from whence our narrative is taken, and likewi&s;e a &s;pecimen of the poems them|&s;elves, to illu&s;trate the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>Plato, in his di&s;cour&s;e called <HI>Io,</HI> lays it down as the character of a true poet, that he delivers his thoughts by in&s;piration, him&s;elf not knowing the expre&s;&s;ions he is to make u&s;e of. According to him, the harmony and turn of the ver&s;e produce in the poet an enthu&s;ia&s;m, which furni&s;hes him with &s;uch thoughts and images, as in a more compo&s;ed hour he would have &s;ought for in vain; who, with|out de&s;ign, without art, and without in&s;truction, is arrived at a wonderful perfection in the art of poetry, and may be placed among poets of the fir&s;t cla&s;s. It is from this cau&s;e &s;he has been more &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;uch pieces as &s;he has written whil&s;t her imagina|tion was warm, than in tho&s;e that &s;he has compo&s;ed coolly, deliberately, and in lei&s;ure hours. The lat|ter always bear &s;ome marks of art, and betray the ab&s;ence of the Mu&s;es. Whenever our authore&s;s is
<PB N="246" REF="255">
in a particular manner &s;truck by any object, either in her &s;olitary hours, or when &s;he is in company, her &s;pirits immediately catch the flame; &s;he has no longer the command of her&s;elf; every &s;pring of her &s;oul is in motion; &s;he feels an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e to compo&s;e, and with an amazing quickne&s;s commits the thoughts to paper, which the Mu&s;e in&s;pires her with; and, like a watch ju&s;t wound up, as &s;oon as her &s;oul is put into motion by the impre&s;&s;ion the ob|ject has made on her, &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in poetry, without knowing in what manner the ideas and figures ri&s;e in her mind. Another and more nice ob&s;ervation of Plato is, that the harmony and turn of the ver&s;e keep up the in&s;piration. Of this truth likewi&s;e our authore&s;s is a living in&s;tance. No &s;ooner hath &s;he hit upon the tone, as &s;he calls it, and the foot of the ver&s;e, but the words go on fluently, and &s;he is never at a lo&s;s for thought or imagery. The mo&s;t delicate turns of the &s;ubject and expre&s;&s;ion ari&s;e in her mind while &s;he is yet writing, as if they were dictated to her. Of her extempore performances, we have an excellent &s;pe|cimen in that beautiful ode &s;acred to the memory of her decea&s;ed uncle, the in&s;tructor of her infancy, written in the year 1761, at a time when &s;he hap|pened to be engaged in company of the fir&s;t rank at Berlin. It con&s;i&s;ts of eight &s;tanzas, of &s;ix lines each, of which the third and &s;ixth have nine &s;ylla|bles, the other ten. It &s;eems while &s;he was in this &s;elect company, &s;he was touched by a &s;udden re|flection,
<PB N="247" REF="256">
with a keen &s;en&s;e of the great difference be|tween her pre&s;ent condition, and her &s;ituation in the early part of her life; and of the great obligation &s;he had been under to the good old man, who, by his attention to her under&s;tanding, had laid the foun|dation of her pre&s;ent happine&s;s. Overcome with a &s;en&s;e of this happine&s;s, and with a heart replete with gratitude, &s;he could contain her&s;elf no longer, but, before all the company, poured forth the over-flowings of her &s;oul (it mu&s;t have been a very af|fecting &s;cene) nearly in the following words:</P>
<P>"Ari&s;e from the du&s;t, ye bones that re&s;t in the land where I pa&s;&s;ed my infant years. Venerable &s;age, re-animate thy body. Ye lips that once fed me with the honey of in&s;truction, be eloquent."</P>
<P>"Oh thou bright &s;hade, look down upon me from the top of Olympus: behold, I am no longer following the cattle in the fields: ob&s;erve the circle of refined mortals that &s;urround me; they all &s;peak of thy niece's poems: Oh li&s;ten to their conver&s;a|tion!"</P>
<P>"For ever flouri&s;h the bread lime, under who&s;e &s;hade I was wont to cling round thy neck full of tenderne&s;s, like a child to the be&s;t of fathers, whil&s;t thou wert repo&s;ing thy&s;elf on the mo&s;&s;y &s;eat, tired as the reaper with the fatigues of a &s;ultry day!"</P>
<P>"Under yon green arched roof I u&s;ed to repeat to thee twenty pa&s;&s;ages in prai&s;e of God &s;upreme, though they were much above my comprehen&s;ion; and when I a&s;ked thee the meaning of many a dark
<PB N="248" REF="257">
&s;entence in the Chri&s;tian &s;acred records, good man, thou did&s;t explain them to me."</P>
<P>"Like a divine in &s;able ve&s;t, who from the lofty pulpit points out the way that leads to life; &s;o thou did&s;t inform me of the fall of man and the covenant of grace, and I, all raptures, &s;natched the words from thy lips with eager ki&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"Thou inhabitant of &s;ome cele&s;tial &s;phere, be|hold the &s;ilent tear of joy! may it often roll down my cheeks! If thou can&s;t &s;peak, dear &s;hade, tell me, did&s;t thou ever conceive any hopes of my pre&s;ent fortune and honour, at the time when my eyes were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively engaged in the reading of books every day more improving?"</P>
<P>"When at thy &s;ide, on &s;ome ro&s;y bank, I &s;at weaving into chaplets for thy temples the flowers my little hands had gathered, and looking up to thee &s;miled filial love, did thy &s;oul then pre&s;age the good things that are now come to pa&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Maye&s;t thou be cloathed with threefold ra|diance, and maye&s;t thou be refre&s;hed with the ema|nations of divine complacence more than the &s;ouls of thy companions. May every drop of temporal plea&s;ure with which my cup of joy overflows, be rewarded unto thee with continual draughts from the ocean of eternal beatitude!"</P>

<P>Yes, Charles; but the&s;e is one thing I mu&s;t guard you again&s;t, which is, that there is a natural pro|pen&s;ity in man, when he is &s;peaking of any thing uncommon, to exaggerate, rather than to &s;imply relate facts.

<PB N="251" REF="260">
compo&s;ition, her talents are indeed miraculous. There are extempore poets among the Italians, the Spaniards, and other nations, who&s;e language is &s;mooth, and where almo&s;t every word ends with a vowel: but the compo&s;itions of the very be&s;t of the&s;e, from every account I have heard, would be very dull and in&s;ignificant, if committed to writing. The German tongue, like the Engli&s;h, is bold, ir|regular, abounding with con&s;onants, and requiring great art and nicety, before it can be adapted to the purpo&s;es of poetry, &s;o as to give plea&s;ure. I can readily &s;uppo&s;e the imagination peculiarly warm at &s;ome moments, teeming with imagery, and over|flowing with words and ideas; but the in&s;tant you lay it under the re&s;traint of certain rules, intricate and &s;evere in their own nature, you di&s;turb its con|nexions, by dividing its attention.

I &s;peak this, children, that you may not be di&s;cou|raged by compari&s;ons: that you may not conclude you want abilities, becau&s;e you find them unequal to miracles.

<HEAD>PRIDE. The extraordinary Hi&s;tory of BIANCA, a Venetian Lady, from the French of M. DE LA LANDE.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the end of the fifteenth century, Thomas Buona Venturi, a young man of Florence, of a creditable family, but without fortune, went to live with a merchant of the &s;ame country, who had &s;ettled at Venice. The merchant's hou&s;e was over-again&s;t the back-door of one that belonged to
<PB N="253" REF="262">
a noble Venetian, who&s;e name was Barthelemi Capello. In the hou&s;e of Capello there was a young lady of great beauty, who&s;e name was Bianca. She was watched with great circum&s;pection, but Buona Venturi frequently &s;aw her at the window. He had not the lea&s;t hope of an interview, yet by a natural, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary impul&s;e, he did all that could be done in &s;uch circum&s;tances, to amu&s;e her, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ion with which &s;he had in&s;pired him. He was young and amiable; &s;he very &s;oon cea&s;ed to be indifferent; and after long negociation, the par|ticulars of which are not related, the lovers found means to accompli&s;h their wi&s;hes. Bianca went every night after the family were retired and a&s;leep, to the chamber of Buona Venturi, in the merchant's hou&s;e, by means of the little back-door, which &s;he left a-jar, and by which &s;he returned before day, without being &s;een by any body. After this had continued &s;ome time, cu&s;tom made her le&s;s cautious, and one night &s;he &s;taid with her lover till the morn|ing was farther advanced than u&s;ual: it happened that a baker's boy, who, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, was taking bread from a neighbour|ing hou&s;e to carry it to the oven, perceived the little back-door by which Bianca had come out, to be a-jar, and &s;uppo&s;ing it to be left open by accident, &s;hut it. The young lady came a few minutes after|wards, and found it fa&s;t; in the con&s;ternation and di&s;tre&s;s which this accident produced, &s;he returned to the hou&s;e &s;he had ju&s;t quitted, and knocking &s;oftly
<PB N="254" REF="263">
at the door, was let in by her lover. Gratitude and love in&s;tantly determined him to &s;acrifice every thing to her &s;afety; he immediately quitted his &s;ituation, and retired with the lady to the hou&s;e of another Florentine, where they remained hidden with the utmo&s;t care and precaution, till they found an op|portunity of e&s;caping to Florence. At Florence he had a little hou&s;e in Via Larga, near St. Mark's, and over-again&s;t a convent of nuns, of the order of St. Catherine. To this little dwelling he retired with his wife, and lived &s;ome time in great privacy, for fear the republic of Venice &s;hould, at the &s;olicita|tions of Capello, cau&s;e him to be pur&s;ued. Francis Maria, the great duke of Tu&s;cany at this time, was a native of France, the &s;on of Co&s;mo the Fir&s;t, and father of Mary de Medicis. He had married Jane of Au&s;tria, daughter of the emperor Ferdinand, and widow of the king of Hungary. She was a prin|ce&s;s of high e&s;timation, but being at this time pa&s;t her youth, the duke neglected her for other women. One of the officers of his court was the confident of his plea&s;ures, who had a wife not le&s;s zealous to render her&s;elf u&s;eful than him&s;elf. The arrival of the fair Venetian was known at Florence, and the rumour of her adventure and her beauty, excited a &s;trong de&s;ire in the Duke to &s;ee her, to which the great privacy of her life contributed not a little. He u&s;ed every day to walk before the hou&s;e to which &s;he had retired, and as &s;he had no amu&s;ement but look|ing out of the window, it was not long before his
<PB N="255" REF="264">
curio&s;ity was gratified. She was indeed half veiled, but he &s;aw enough to judge of her beauty, of which he became violently enamoured. His confidante perceiving his pa&s;&s;ion to be un&s;urmountable, began to concert mea&s;ures for the gratification of it, and engaged his wife to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the project. The mi&s;|fortunes which Bianca had already &s;uffered, and tho&s;e to which &s;he was &s;till expo&s;ed, gave this good woman a pretence to in&s;inuate that &s;he had &s;ome|thing of importance to communicate to her, and for that purpo&s;e invited her to dinner. Buona Venturi was &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence whether he &s;hould &s;uffer Bianca to accept the invitation; but the rank of the lady, and the need in which he &s;tood of protection, at length got the better of his caution and doubts. Bianca was received with the mo&s;t flattering kind|ne&s;s and attention; was prevailed upon to relate the &s;tory of her di&s;tre&s;s, and was heard with an appear|ance of the mo&s;t tender concern; obliging offers were made her, and pre&s;&s;ed with &s;o generous a friend&s;hip, that &s;he could not refu&s;e to accept of &s;ome pre&s;ents from the lady. The duke, informed of the &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t vi&s;it, hoped that he might be pre&s;ent at the &s;econd. Another invitation was immediately &s;ent to Bianca, and after new marks of e&s;teem and regard, new pity of her misfortunes, and new prai&s;es of her beauty, &s;he was a&s;ked if &s;he had no de&s;ire to make her court to the grand duke, who, on his part, was impatient to become acquainted with her, having already found an opportunity to &s;ee
<PB N="256" REF="265">
and admire her. Bianca had not fortitude and virtue to re&s;i&s;t this new honour, which, though &s;he at fir&s;t affected to refu&s;e, her crafty &s;educer di&s;covered, by her eyes, that &s;he wi&s;hed to be urged to accept. Ju&s;t at this cri&s;is it was contrived that the grand duke &s;hould come in, without any appearance of de&s;ign; and Bianca was charmed with the mode&s;ty of his addre&s;s, the warmth of his prai&s;e, and the libe|rality of his offers. Other vi&s;its &s;ucceeded, and a familiarity in&s;en&s;ibly came on; &s;ome pre&s;ents which &s;he could not refu&s;e from her &s;overeign, improved the duke's advantage; and the hu&s;band him&s;elf did not think it prudent to break a connexion which might be at once innocent and advantageous. The duke was not likely to &s;top &s;hort in &s;o good a road; he gained new influence over the wife by advancing the hu&s;band, and at la&s;t accompli&s;hed his wi&s;hes &s;o much to the &s;atisfaction of all parties, that, as the Italians expre&s;s it, he and Bianca and Buona Venturi, made a <HI>triangulo equilatero.</HI> The hu&s;band &s;oon became familiar with his new condition, and removed with his wife to a hou&s;e in the fine &s;treet that leads to a bridge over the Arno, called Trinity Bridge. This hou&s;e is &s;till &s;tanding; it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the arms of Medicis &s;urmounted by a hat, and belongs at pre&s;ent to the Ricardi family. Buona Venturi &s;olaced him&s;elf for the lo&s;s of Bianca, by forming new connexions, and a&s;&s;ociated with the nobility of the country; but a change of fortune &s;o &s;udden, and &s;o great, rendered him in&s;olent, over|bearing,
<PB N="257" REF="266">
and pre&s;umptuous even in his behaviour to the duke him&s;elf, and created him &s;o many enemies that he was at length a&s;&s;a&s;inated near the bridge that led to his hou&s;e. The duke and his new mi&s;tre&s;s were not much afflicted at this accident. She totally lo&s;t her re&s;erve and timidity, and appeared in public with a magnificent equipage, &s;etting honour and &s;hame at defiance. Jane, the grand dutche&s;s, was extremely mortified at the conduct of her hu&s;band, and provoked by the pride of her rival, yet &s;he &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed both her grief and re&s;entment, which, how|ever, &s;ecretly &s;ubverted her con&s;titution, and at length put an end to her life. The death of the grand dutche&s;s opened new views to the ambition of Bianca, who had acquired an a&s;cendancy over the Duke, which rendered him wholly &s;ub&s;ervient to her will, and &s;he now exerted all her art to induce him to marry her. The cardinal Ferdinand de Me|dicis, who was next heir to the dukedom if his bro|ther &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, oppo&s;ed this marriage in vain, and Bianca, in a &s;hort time was made grand dutche&s;s of Tu&s;cany. After &s;ome time &s;he became very de&s;irous of a child who might &s;ucceed the grand duke in his dominions; &s;he cau&s;ed ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid, and a&s;trologers to be con&s;ulted, but the&s;e, and many other expedients proving ineffectual, &s;he re&s;olved to feign a pregnancy, and introduce a &s;purious child, of which &s;he would at lea&s;t have the honour. To a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the execution of this project, &s;he applied to a cordelier of the mona&s;tery of Ogni Sancti, who
<PB N="258" REF="267">
readily undertaking the affair, &s;he feigned tran&s;ient &s;ickne&s;s, nau&s;eas, and other &s;ymptoms of pregnancy; took to her bed, received the compliments of the court, and the duke him&s;elf expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfac|tion upon &s;o happy an event. Her pretended reckon|ing being up, &s;he &s;uddenly alarmed her people in the middle of the night, complained of labour pains, and enquired impatiently for her confe&s;&s;or. The cardinal, who &s;u&s;pected the artifices of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, had her &s;o diligently watched, that he knew all her motions; as &s;oon as he was informed that her confe&s;&s;or was &s;ent for, he repaired to her anti-cham|ber, in which he walked to and fro, repeating his breviary. The dutche&s;s hearing he was there, &s;ent him a me&s;&s;age, intreating that he would retire, becau&s;e &s;he could not bear that he &s;hould hear the cries which might be forced from her by her pains. The cardinal an&s;wered, "let her highne&s;s think only of her own bu&s;ine&s;s as I do of mine." As &s;oon as the confe&s;&s;or arrived, the cardinal ran to him, crying out, "welcome, welcome, my dear father, the grand dutche&s;s is in labour, and has great need of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance;" at the &s;ame time catching him in his arms, and embracing him, he perceived a jolly boy, ju&s;t born, which the good father had got in his &s;leeve. He in&s;tantly took the child from him, and cried out loud enough to be heard by the dutche&s;s, "God be prai&s;ed, the prince&s;s is happily delivered of a &s;on;" at the &s;ame time &s;hewing him to all that were pre&s;ent. The grand dutche&s;s, enraged almo&s;t
<PB N="259" REF="268">
to di&s;traction at this in&s;ult and di&s;appointment, de|termined to be revenged on the cardinal, and the grand duke, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion had &s;uffered no abatement, &s;oon gave her an opportunity. They were all three on a country party, at Poggio a' Caino, and eat at the &s;ame table. The cardinal was extremely fond of blanc-manger, and the dutche&s;s procured &s;ome that was mixed with poi&s;on, and had it &s;erved up. The cardinal, who had many &s;pies about her, was in|formed of it. He &s;at down at table, however, as u&s;ual, but notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;olici|tations of the dutche&s;s, he would not touch the blanc-manger. "Well, &s;aid the Duke, if the car|dinal will not eat, I will;" and immediately took &s;ome into his plate. The dutche&s;s not being able to prevent his eating it without di&s;covering her crime, perceived her&s;elf to be undone for ever; and to avoid the re&s;entment of her brother-in-law, the cardinal, &s;he ate the remainder of the poi&s;oned di&s;h her&s;elf, and died with her hu&s;band.</P>
