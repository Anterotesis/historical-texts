<HEAD>OSRIC&mdash;THE LION!</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A ROMANCE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SWIFT roll the Rhine's billows, and water the plains,</L>
<L>Where Falkenstein Castle's majestic remains,</L>
<L>Their moss-cover'd turrets still rear;</L>
<L>Oft loves the gaunt wolf midst the ruins to prowl,</L>
<L>What Time from the battlements pours the lone owl</L>
<L>Her plaints in the passenger's ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No longer resound through the vaults of yon hall</L>
<L>The song of the minstrel, and mirth of the ball;</L>
<L>Those pleasures for ever are fled;</L>
<L>There now dwells the bat with her light-shunning brood;</L>
<L>There ravens and vultures now clamour for food,</L>
<L>And all is dark, silent, and dread!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ha! Dost thou not see by the Moon's trembling light,</L>
<L>Directing his steps, where advances a Knight,</L>
<L>His eye big with vengeance and fate?</L>
<L>'Tis Osric&mdash;the Lion, his Nephew who leads,</L>
<L>And swift up the crackling old stair-case proceeds,</L>
<L>Gains the hall, and quick closes the gate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<L>Now round him young Carloman casting his eyes,</L>
<L>Surveys the sad scene with dismay and surprize,</L>
<L>And fear steals the rose from his cheeks;</L>
<L>His spirits forsake him, his courage is flown;</L>
<L>The hand of Sir Osric he clasps in his own,</L>
<L>And while his voice falters he speaks:&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Dear Uncle," he murmurs, "why linger we here?</L>
<L>'Tis late, and these chambers are damp and are drear;</L>
<L>Keen blows through the ruins the blast!</L>
<L>Oh! let us away and our journey pursue;</L>
<L>Fair Blumenberg's Castle will rise on our view,</L>
<L>Soon as Falkenstein Forest is past.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Why roll thus your eye-balls? Why glare they so wild?</L>
<L>Oh! chide not my weakness, nor frown, that a child</L>
<L>Should view these apartments with dread;</L>
<L>For know, that full oft have I heard from my Nurse,</L>
<L>There still on this Castle has rested a curse,</L>
<L>Since innocent blood here was shed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"She said, too, bad spirits, and ghosts all in white,</L>
<L>Here use to resort at the dead time of night,</L>
<L>Nor vanish till breaking of day;</L>
<L>And still at their coming is heard the deep tone</L>
<L>Of a bell&mdash;loud and awful&mdash;Hark! hark! 'twas a groan!</L>
<L>Good Uncle, oh! let us away!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<L>"Peace, serpent!" thus Osric&mdash;the Lion, replies,</L>
<L>While rage and malignity gloom in his eyes;</L>
<L>"Thy journey and life here must close:</L>
<L>Thy Castle's proud turrets no more shalt thou see;</L>
<L>No more betwixt Blumenberg's Lordship and me</L>
<L>Shalt thou stand, and my greatness oppose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"My Brother lies breathless on Palestine's plains,</L>
<L>And though once remov'd, to his noble domains</L>
<L>My right can no rival deny:</L>
<L>Then, stripling, prepare on my dagger to bleed;</L>
<L>No succour is near, and thy fate is decreed;</L>
<L>Commend thee to Jesus, and die!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus saying, he seizes the boy by the arm,</L>
<L>Whose grief rends the vaulted hall's roof, while alarm</L>
<L>His heart of all fortitude robs:</L>
<L>His limbs sink beneath him; distracted with fears,</L>
<L>He falls at his Uncle's feet, bathes them with tears,</L>
<L>And&mdash;"Spare me! Oh! spare me!" he sobs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! 'tis in vain that he strives to appease</L>
<L>The miscreant; in vain does he cling round his knees,</L>
<L>And sue in soft accents for life:</L>
<L>Unmov'd by his sorrow&mdash;unmov'd by his pray'r,</L>
<L>Fierce Osric has twisted his hand in his hair,</L>
<L>And aims at his bosom a knife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<L>But e'er the steel blushes with blood, strange to tell!</L>
<L>Self-struck, does the tongue of the hollow-ton'd bell</L>
<L>The presence of midnight declare:</L>
<L>And while, with amazement, his hair bristles high,</L>
<L>Hears Osric a voice, loud and terrible, cry,</L>
<L>In sounds heart appalling&mdash;"Forbear!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Straight curses and shrieks thro' the chambers resound,</L>
<L>With hellish mirth mingled; the walls shake around;</L>
<L>The groaning roof threatens to fall;</L>
<L>Loud bellows the thunder; blue lightnings still flash;</L>
<L>The casements they clatter; chains rattle; doors clash,</L>
<L>And flames spread their waves through the hall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The clamour increases; the portals expand;</L>
<L>O'er the pavement's black marble now rushes a band</L>
<L>Of daemons all dropping with gore;</L>
<L>In visage so grim, and so monstrous in height,</L>
<L>That Carloman screams, as they burst on his sight,</L>
<L>And sinks without sense on the floor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so his fell Uncle: he sees that the throng</L>
<L>Impels, loudly shrieking, a female along,</L>
<L>And well the sad spectre he knows:</L>
<L>The daemons with curses her steps onward urge;</L>
<L>Her shoulders with whips form'd of serpents they scourge,</L>
<L>And fast from her wounds the blood flows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<L>"Oh! welcome," she cry'd, and her voice spoke despair;</L>
<L>Oh! welcome, Sir Osric, the torments to share,</L>
<L>Of which thou hast made me the prey:</L>
<L>Twelve years have I languish'd thy coming to see;</L>
<L>Ulrilda, who perish'd dishonour'd by thee,</L>
<L>Now calls thee to anguish away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My ruin compleated, thy love became hate;</L>
<L>Thy hand gave the draught which consign'd me to Fate;</L>
<L>Nor thought I death lurk'd in the bowl;</L>
<L>Unfit for the grave, stain'd with guilt, swell'd with pride,</L>
<L>Unblest, unabsolv'd, unrepenting I dy'd,</L>
<L>And daemons straight seiz'd on my soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thou com'st, and with transport I feel my breast swell!</L>
<L>Full long I have suffer'd the torments of hell,</L>
<L>And now shall its pleasures be mine!</L>
<L>See, see, how the fiends are athirst for thy blood!</L>
<L>Twelve years has my panting heart furnish'd their food,</L>
<L>Come, wretch, let them feast upon thine!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She said, and the daemons their prey flock'd around;</L>
<L>They dash'd him with horrible yell on the ground,</L>
<L>And blood down his limbs trickl'd fast:</L>
<L>His eyes from their sockets with fury they tore;</L>
<L>They fed on his entrails, all reeking with gore,</L>
<L>And his heart was Ulrilda's repast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<L>But now the grey cock told the coming of day;</L>
<L>The fiends with their victim straight vanish'd away,</L>
<L>And Carloman's heart throbb'd again:</L>
<L>With terror recalling the deeds of the night,</L>
<L>He rose, and from Falkenstein speeding his flight,</L>
<L>Soon reach'd his paternal domain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since then all with horror the ruins behold;</L>
<L>No shepherd, though stray'd be a lamb from his fold,</L>
<L>No mother, though lost be her child,</L>
<L>The fugitive dares in these chambers to seek,</L>
<L>Where fiends nightly revel, and guilty ghosts shriek,</L>
<L>In accents most fearful and wild!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! shun them, ye pilgrims, tho' late be the hour,</L>
<L>Tho' loud howl the tempest, and fast fall the show'r,</L>
<L>From Falkenstein Castle be gone!</L>
<L>There still their said banquet Hell's denizens share;</L>
<L>There Osric&mdash;the Lion, still raves in despair;</L>
<L>Breathe a prayer for his soul, and pass on!</L>
