<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE mona&s;tery of CLUNI, from whence ABE|LARD is &s;uppo&s;ed to write the following Epi&s;tle, was founded in the year 611, near the village of Ma&s;con, on the river Graone. The Head of this convent (in the time of ABELARD) was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for his learning and humanity. Hi&s;tory ele|vates him above the vulgar herd of monks by the ap|pellation of the Venerable PETER! He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD, when he was under the cen&s;ure of the court of Rome.</P>
<P>SAINT BERNARD al&s;o is connected with the &s;tory of Paraclete. This great man &s;tands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century: Born with a mind too re&s;tle&s;s and enterpri&s;ing to be confined within the circle of mona&s;tic occupations, he ru&s;hed into the tu|mult
<PB N="vi" REF="6">of active life, and took the lead in &s;ome of the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions of that period. With an undi&s;ciplined ardour peculiar to his character, he pre|cipitated his country into that ruinous mea&s;ure, the &s;e|cond cru&s;ade. Behold him at another time ha&s;tening to the conte&s;t that held all EUROPE in &s;u&s;pence, which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom. The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpow|ered the preten&s;ions of ANACLETUS, and INNOCENT was &s;eated on the papal throne. The enemies of this celebrated Abbot never impeached his moral charac|ter; but it mu&s;t be allowed that in his zeal again&s;t the innovation of new opinions, he has &s;ometimes left unregarded the &s;uperior duty of charity. A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO, the pope's legate in France, contains the mo&s;t intolerant and &s;anguinary coun&s;el: His per&s;ecution however of ABELARD was prompted (according to the opinion of &s;ome authors) by an im|pul&s;e of jealou&s;y, alarmed at the &s;plendid literary re|putation of &s;o young a per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
ABELARD in the following epi&s;tle lays a con&s;iderable &s;tre&s;s upon his &s;entence of excommunication: In the dark ages, that &s;piritual humiliation was felt as the greate&s;t calamity; the relation, the parent, the lover, the friend, &s;u&s;pended their endearing offices, and with|drew from the degraded offender.</P>

<L>YON midnight bell, that frights the peaceful air!</L>
<L>Commands the Fathers to their wonted pray'r:</L>
<L>Now in long order flows the &s;able throng,</L>

<L>Why joins not ABELARD the &s;ainted train?</L>
<L>Does torpid &s;loth his ling'ring &s;teps detain?</L>
<L>The&s;e walls, that pillow &s;teep'd in tears, atte&s;t</L>

<L>While the dread &s;ecret from my &s;oul I tear,</L>
<L>And unre&s;erv'd my bo&s;om'd feelings bear.</L>
<L>Ah me! the pa&s;&s;ion that my &s;oul, mi&s;led</L>
<L>Was check'd, not conquer'd; buried, but not dead:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="9">Now bur&s;ting from the grave, in evil hour,</L>
<L>It ha&s;tens to its prey with fiercer pow'r,</L>
<L>And, vulture-like, with appetite increas'd</L>
<L>It riots on the undimini&s;h'd fea&s;t.</L>
<L>Daughter of Paraclete do&s;t thou complain</L>
<L>In iron &s;ilence that I lock'd my pain?</L>
<L>That not to thee (&s;oft &s;olacer in woe)</L>
<L>I bad the troubled waves of Angui&s;h flow?</L>
<L>Methought the cour&s;e of three long years' retreat</L>
<L>Would &s;carce thy length'ning &s;acrifice complete:</L>
<L>Methought I &s;hould profane the hallow'd rite,</L>
<L>Did my laments thy pitying ear affright:</L>
<L>Thus at the altar, wrapt in holy dread,</L>
<L>The youth of Macedon in &s;ilence bled,</L>
<L>Nor from his tortur'd and con&s;uming hand</L>
<L>Di&s;mi&s;s'd the living clo&s;e-adhering brand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the boy at Athens, who, while he was a&s;&s;i&s;ting at a religious ceremony, endured a burning coal that &s;ell on his hand, rather than di&s;turb the &s;acrifice.</NOTE></L>
