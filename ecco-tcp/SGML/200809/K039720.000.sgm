<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;putes which have taken place in the learned world, re&s;pecting tho&s;e po|ems which were publi&s;hed &s;ome time ago under the names of Rowley and Canning, are &s;till undetermined; notwith&s;tanding all the arguments brought on one &s;ide to &s;up|port their authenticity, and on the other to prove them the forgeries of a young li|terary adventurer, the que&s;tion is &s;till brought to no conclu&s;ion, and as the parti|&s;ans of each hypothe&s;is declare them&s;elves unconvinced by the evidences of the other, the matter may be con&s;idered as yet in|volved in doubt and ob&s;curity. The fol|lowing collection of pieces are liable to none of the objections which are made to the other. They are the genuine and ac|knowledged
<PB N="x" REF="8">
productions of Thomas Chat|terton; a per&s;on who&s;e genius and abilities, exerci&s;ed at a very early period of life, will no le&s;s command the re&s;pect of po&s;terity, than they have excited the attention, and divided the &s;entiments of the able&s;t judge of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Rowley's poems, the pre|vailing opinion &s;eems to be, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> they were actually written by Chatterton: for though the antique manner in which they were cloathed, had &s;erved greatly to di&s;gui&s;e them, yet it could not but be ob&s;erved that that the &s;moothne&s;s of the ver&s;ification, and the frequent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The argument ari&s;ing from the coincidences which might be pointed out between the &s;uppo&s;ed an|cient poems and later writers, hath not been attended to in the manner it de&s;erves. It would be more de|ci&s;ive than any other yet made u&s;e of. Let any per&s;on compare the parallel pa&s;&s;ages lately pointed out by a writer in the St. James's Chronicle, No. 2671, May 21, 1778, and at the &s;ame time advert to the rules laid down by bi&s;hop Hurd, for the di&s;covery of imita|tions, and he will not he&s;itate to acknowledge, that the writer of Rowley's poems certainly lived in the pre&s;ent century. As this letter will be con&s;idered as a curio&s;ity by all who intere&s;t them&s;elves concern|ing the authenticity of tho&s;e poems, and as it is not readily to be referred to, being printed only in a news-paper, we have &s;ubjoined it to the pre&s;ent publication.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page xxiv.</NOTE></NOTE> traces of imitation of later
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
writers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> their being the productions of the fifteenth century. The&s;e circum&s;tances did no e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of many gentle|men at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ir f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t appearance; but that for|geries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ld be attempted by one who had not reached the age of &s;eventeen years, and that the&s;e attempts &s;hould be conducted with a degree of &s;kill and judgment, which obliged the mo&s;t intelligent to doubt, and
<PB N="xii" REF="10">
at the &s;ame time almo&s;t compelled the mo&s;t doubtful to a&s;&s;ent, &s;eemed to be hardly within the reach of probability; it rather, in the opinion of many, bordered on im|impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>It hath been pre&s;umed, though without du|ly weighing circum&s;tances, that it would be a wild conjecture to &s;uppo&s;e a young, and almo&s;t uneducated man, was capable of con|ducting a complicated fraud, which required applications very different from tho&s;e which the &s;ea&s;on of his life, and his means of in|formation &s;eemed to point out, and at the &s;ame time &s;uch a cour&s;e of &s;tudy as is very &s;eldom pur&s;ued until a more advanced pe|riod. But before this is granted, it &s;hould be recollected that he was, as Mr. Warton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Additions to Hi&s;tory of Poetry, vol. II.</NOTE> ob&s;erve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, <HI>a &s;ingular in&s;tance of a prematurity</HI>
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
<HI>of abilities, and that he had acquired a &s;tore of general information far exceeding his years; that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a comprehen&s;ion of mind, and activity of under&s;tanding, which predominated over his &s;ituations in life, and his opportunities of in&s;truction.</HI> When the&s;e facts are remem|bered, it will not be con&s;idered &s;o very incre|dible; and the hi&s;tory of the human mind will furni&s;h many examples of a maturity of judgment in per&s;ons at as early an age, which will dimini&s;h the &s;urpri&s;e which mu&s;t at the fir&s;t glance impre&s;s every per&s;on who reflects upon this extraordinary phenomenon. It &s;hould be recollected, before we pronouce de|ci&s;ively upon this &s;ubject, that there have been in&s;tances almo&s;t as extraordinary as that we have now under con&s;ideration. Dr. Wot|ton, at the age of &s;ix years, acquired a con|&s;iderable knowledge in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues; and Dr. John&s;on
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
has given the life of one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Phillip Barretier.</NOTE> who ma&s;tered five languages at the age of nine years. The&s;e acqui&s;itions are certainly as wonder|ful as Chatterton's knowledge of the ob&s;o|lete language of the 15th and 16th centuries, which he was known to be fond of, and to which he had particularly applied his atten|tion. Nor &s;hould the contrivance of &s;uch a fraud be deemed beyond the reach of one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch abilities. It is known that a per&s;on who was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of P&s;almanazar, in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, fabricated a new language, and actually &s;ucceeded in impo&s;ing upon &s;ome of the mo&s;t intelligent and inqui&s;itive per&s;ons of the times, who were equally as de&s;irous, as able to detect the impo&s;ture, had it not been managed with a degree of art which eluded all their vigilance.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="13">
It will hardly be denied, that acqui&s;itions like tho&s;e we have before mentioned are equally &s;urpri&s;ing with any which Chatter|ton is &s;uppo&s;ed to have reached; unle&s;s the invention of new characters for a language, or the difficulties of obtaining an accurate knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and He|brew, are more ea&s;y to overcome than to imi|tate the manner of writing in the time of Edward the fourth. But in&s;tances may be produced of per&s;ons who&s;e extent of intelli|gence hath been as great in &s;ubjects more ab|&s;tru&s;e, and not le&s;s out of the common walk, than tho&s;e to which Chatterton devoted his attention. It will be &s;ufficient to name the celebrated Crichton, and M. Servin, men|tioned by Sully, between both whom and our author a re&s;emblance might be di&s;|covered, as well in their a&s;toni&s;hing abilities, as in tho&s;e defects which marked the private
<PB N="xvi" REF="14">
characters of each of the&s;e young adventu|rers.</P>
<P>As the pre&s;ent publication con&s;i&s;ts of pieces of which not the &s;malle&s;t doubt was ever entertained of their being genuine, it is totally unnece&s;&s;ary here to enter into any ar|gument either to &s;upport or invalidate tho&s;e proofs which have been adduced of the au|thenticity of the &s;uppo&s;ed ancient poems; and it is the le&s;s incumbent on the pre&s;ent editor, as the public hath lately received en|tire &s;atisfaction on that head from the &s;ame gentleman to whom we are indebted for the fir&s;t collection of this writer's works. It may not however be unnece&s;&s;ary to add a few words, in order to compleat the &s;hort account given by that gentleman of &s;o extraordinary a per&s;onage, who may be con&s;idered as the lite|rary phenomenon of the times, and who&s;e ge|nius, if it had been properly fo&s;tered and en|couraged, might have carried Engli&s;h litera|ture
<PB N="xvii" REF="15">
to as high a pitch as any author in the pre&s;ent century. One can &s;carce avoid draw|ing a parallel upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, from the &s;imilarity of circum&s;tances between our author and the great father of the Engli&s;h &s;tage; the one obliged to cramp and aba&s;e his genius to the ideas and ta&s;te of a barbarous audience; the other, from nece&s;&s;ity, compel|led to obey the mandates of the directers of our monthly publications, equally dog|matical, ignorant and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>The former editor hath already &s;et forth the few circum&s;tances, relative to his au|thor, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common, with other men. The time of his birth, and death; the names of his parents, his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and the confined mode of his edu|cation, are all accurately &s;tated. It is to be regretted, that he permitted, the <HI>&s;ang|froid</HI> of the antiquary, to repre&s;s, that
<PB N="xviii" REF="16">
warmth, which the excellence of his author might have been expected to excite; &s;urely, that excellence demanded &s;ome few words of commendation: it is al&s;o to be lamented that he did not enter more minutely into the di&s;po&s;ition and circum&s;tances of one whom he could not but re&s;pect as an author, however he might di&s;like his chararacter, as a man: and here it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, Chatterton appears to us in the mo&s;t un|favourab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e point of view. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the vices and irregularities of youth, and his profligacy was, at lea&s;t, as con&s;picuous as his abilities. Although he was of a pro|fe&s;&s;ion which might be &s;aid to accelerate his pur&s;uits in antiquities, yet &s;o aver&s;e was he to that profe&s;&s;ion, that he could ne|ver overcome it. One of his fir&s;t efforts, to emerge from a &s;ituation &s;o irk&s;ome to him, was an application to a gentleman well known in the republic of letters;
<PB N="xix" REF="17">
which unfortunately for the public, and him|&s;elf, met with a very cold reception; and which the di&s;appointed author always &s;poke of with a high degree of acrimony, when|ever it was mentioned to him.</P>
<P>After his quitting Bri&s;tol, he was engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Northhook, in a hi&s;tory of London, then publi&s;hing in numbers, and, at the &s;ame time, was daily writing &s;ome piece for the magazines. Every effort ap|pears to have been in&s;ufficient to ward off the approach of poverty; and very &s;oon after he &s;ettled in London, his di&s;tre&s;s be|came &s;o great, that he meditated a de&s;ign of going to Senegal. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Poem to Mi&s;s Bu&s;h page 85.</NOTE> This intention was never executed. He continued drudging for the book&s;ellers a few months, when at la&s;t, oppre&s;&s;ed with poverty and di&s;ea&s;e, in
<PB N="xx" REF="18">
a fit of de&s;pair, he put an end to his exi&s;t|ence in the month of Augu&s;t 1770, with a do&s;e of poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Such was the wretched life, and &s;uch the fatal end, of one who, had he not prema|turely fini&s;hed his days, had bidden fair to do the highe&s;t honours to Engli&s;h litera|ture. The reader will anticipate every re|flection of regret which can be made upon this occa&s;ion; and while he &s;ympathizes with the unfortunate, he will lament that one who is allowed to have been, as Mr. Warton expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline">"a prodigy of genius,"</Q> &s;hould, by the mere dint of di&s;tre&s;s, be tempted to rid him&s;elf of an in&s;upportable exi&s;tence. He will feel him&s;elf hurt at the idea that no notice &s;hould be taken of one who the la&s;t mentioned writer pronounces would have proved the fir&s;t of Engli&s;h po|ets, had he reached a maturer age; and per|haps
<PB N="xxi" REF="19">
he may feel &s;ome indignation again&s;t the per&s;on to whom his fir&s;t application was made, and by whom he was treated with neglect and contempt. It were to be wi&s;h|ed that the public was fully informed of all the circum&s;tances attending that unhappy application; the event of which deprived the world of works which might have con|tributed to the honour of the nation, as well as the comfort and happine&s;s of their unfortunate author.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, by the elegant writer before quoted, that &s;ome of the ver&s;es con|tained in the following mi&s;cellany, which are tho&s;e written by their author <HI>without any de&s;ign to deceive, have been judged to be mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing productions by the fir&s;t critic of the pre&s;ent age.</HI> After &s;uch a judgment it cannot be mentioned with|out exciting wonder, that writings which
<PB REF="20">
de&s;erve &s;uch a character, &s;hould conti|nue undi&s;tingui&s;hed amid&s;t the tra&s;h of monthly compilations. A &s;triking &s;imila|rity may be ob&s;erved between them and their author, both having met with a fate very unworthy their merit, equally con|temned and de&s;pi&s;ed; he, living and dying in ob&s;curity; they, remaining neglected and almo&s;t unknown.</P>
<P>That they may hereafter &s;tand a monu|ment of the application and abilities of an unfortunate man, untimely lo&s;t to him&s;elf and to the public, one who had a &s;light knowledge of him in his life time, but not enough to be acquainted with his merits, until too late, who con&s;iders the neglect which hath been &s;hewn to the&s;e his acknow|ledged works, as an imputation on the ta&s;te and curio&s;ity of the age, hath employed a few lei&s;ure hours in collecting the following
<PB N="xxiii" REF="21">
mi&s;cellany, which he tru&s;ts, after &s;uch re|&s;pectable opinions as are before quoted, will not require either excu&s;e or apology, but on the contrary, will entitle him to the acknow|ledgments of tho&s;e readers who&s;e candour will induce them to applaud the marks of ge|nius which may be found herein, and at the &s;ame time make every due allowance for tho&s;e imperfections which ha&s;te, or the un|happy circum&s;tances in which many of them were written, would have given the author, had he been living, a title to expect and demand.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the opinion which the reverend Mr. Thomas Warton has delivered, concerning the authenticity of the poems attributed to Row|ley, it may be expected that tho&s;e who maintain a contrary doctrine, &s;hould publi&s;h &s;ome arguments in &s;upport of it. For my part I &s;hall rather employ memory than &s;agacity on this &s;ubject, and have no weight to throw into either &s;cale, except the fol|lowing parallels; ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, how extraordinary it is that &s;o many coincidences &s;hould be di&s;coverable between Shake&s;peare, Dryden, &amp;c. and Rowley, who&s;e name was never heard of till within the&s;e ten years pa&s;t.</P>

<P>Ceormond, with the green &s;pear, martialled his band: he deduced his lineage from Woden, and di&s;played the &s;hield of Penda. Strong as the tower of Pendragon on the hill, furious as the &s;ouls of the unburied warriors; his company were all chiefs.

Upon the high hills he encountered Moryon; like da&s;hing waves, they ru&s;hed to the war; their &s;words rained blood to the valley beneath.

<P>Bladdyn fell by his hand; he burnt the palace of the wood: the horn, embo&s;&s;ed with gold, gra|ced his &s;poils; he returned to his ca&s;tle over a &s;ea of blood.</P>

<P>The &s;on of Meurig an&s;wered not: the anlace of Dunhelm divided his head; his blows fell like the &s;tones of hail, when the loud winds &s;hake the top of the lofty tree; the warriors fled like the clouds of night, at the approach of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Elgar, from the borders of Northumberland, was among the enemies of Godred Crovan, &s;on of Ha|rald the Black: he led his troop down the hill, and began the fight with O&s;pray: like the raging of the lake of blood, when the loud winds whi&s;tle over the &s;harp cliffs of the rock, was the noi&s;e of the battle.</P>
<P>Summerled ro&s;e in the &s;ight like the rays of the morning; blood beamed about him; his helmet &s;ell from his head; his eyes were like the lights upon the billows.</P>

<P>O&s;pray, like a lion, ravages the band of Elgar. Octha follows behind him, dying his long white robe in blood.</P>
<P>Elgar flies to the &s;on of Vorti; his &s;pear &s;ounds upon his helmet; the &s;word of Octha divides the &s;hield of Elgar: the Northumbrian warrior retires to his band.

<P>Raignald, with his band, flies to the relief of Dunhelm: the troops of Wilver and O&s;pray &s;lowly retire. Dunhelm falls by the javelin of an un|known warrior; &s;o falls the eagle by the arrow of the child.</P>

<HEAD>FRAGMENT OF A SERMON BY THE CELEBRATED ROWLIE</HEAD>
<HEAD>To the <HI>Editor</HI> of the <HI>Gentleman's</HI> MAGAZINE.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE late publication of a volume of poems, &s;aid to have been written by Thomas Rowlie, in the 15th century, having given ri&s;e to &s;ome ingenious critici&s;ms re&s;pecting their authenticity, I beg leave to &s;end you the following fragment of a &s;ermon by the &s;ame author. It was given to me &s;ome time &s;ince by Mr. George Catcott, who&s;e name has been &s;o often mentioned on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and to who&s;e inqui&s;itive di&s;po&s;ition, and very commendable zeal, the public is principally indebted for the pre&s;ervation and appearance of the&s;e valuable productions of antiquity. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that, when Chatterton gave this fragment to his friend, he was utterly (and ever after continued) unacquainted with any language but his mother-tongue; and that
<PB N="113" REF="143">
the citations of the&s;e languages, from two antient authors, have been fully authenticated. The po|etical talents of our bard are e&s;tabli&s;hed by the publication of his poems; but the following frag|ment of a &s;ermon on the divinity of the Holy Spirit, di&s;plays him in the more illu&s;trious charac|ter of an orthodox divine. Every circum&s;tance which tends to throw light on the hi&s;tory of Row|lie &s;hould be given to the public, and his &s;enti|ments on &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion by no means &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding they may not have the &s;anction of an age unhap|pily overgrown with Ariani&s;m and infidelity. Chat|terton him&s;elf, although he totally di&s;believed the &s;ubject of the fragment, had, however the inge|nuity to produce it; and I am &s;orry that the inge|nuous editors had not thought it (and &s;ome others of Rowlie's pro&s;e productions in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) worthy of being publi&s;hed together with his poeti|cal compo&s;itions.</P>

<P>I have been favoured with the peru&s;al of &s;ome pro&s;e MSS. now in Mr. Catcot's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that prove Rowlie's exi&s;tence beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Chiefly collected from ROWLEY's Poems.</HEAD>
<P>SIR William Canynge, whom Rowley ju&s;tly &s;tyles <Q REND="inline">"a grete and goode man, the favou|ryte of Godde, the friende of the chyrche, the companyonne of kynges, and the &s;adre of hys na|tyve cittie,"</Q> was a younger &s;on of a citizen of Bri&s;tol.

<P>He was al&s;o of a comely per&s;on, but married, it &s;eems, for love, without a fortune. Soon after, however, his father and elder brother, who both loved money as much as he de&s;pi&s;ed it, died, and left him large e&s;tates in land and money, with his

<BIBL>Ibid. p. 284.</BIBL></Q> in the year 1456. But &s;oon this dawning was overca&s;t by the death of his wife, his &s;econd &s;elf. Of his native city he was mayor five times; and be&s;ide &s;everal other charities, founded an alms|hou&s;e or ho&s;pital (which is yet in being) at Red|cliff-hill, and built a chapel, and that noble church of St. Mary Redcliff, the fine&s;t pari&s;h-church in England,<Q><L>"The may&s;trie of a human hande,</L>

12th of March, 1467, the 2d and 16th of April, 1468, re&s;pectively. Being then made dean of the collegiate church of We&s;tbury, Wilts, with his u&s;ual munificence he rebuilt that college. Soon after his taking orders, he gave, by a deed of tru&s;t, dated 20th of October, 1467, in part of a benefaction of 500l. to St. Mary Redcliff church, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>certain jewels</HI> of Sir Theobald Gorges<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sir Theobald Gorges was a Knight of an ancient family &s;eated at Wraxhall, within a few miles of Bri&s;tol. (See <HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> 3 H. VI. n. 28. Leland's Itin. Vol. vii. p. 98.) He was an actor in both Rowley's tragedies, and wrote one of the <HI>Myn&s;irelles Songes,</HI> in Aella, p. 91, "Rowley, I&s;camm and <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">b.

<P>Full of good works, he died in the year 1474, and was buried in Redcliff church, where two monuments were erected to his memory, one with his effigies in the robes of a magi&s;trate, the other in tho&s;e of a prie&s;t, cut in white marble. Be&s;ides his many other charitable donations, he &s;et|tled lands to pay 44l. <HI>per annum</HI> to the &s;heriffs,

in lieu of toll demanded by them, at the city gates. For an account of the che&s;ts depo&s;ited by him in Redcliff church, &s;ee pp. 272-3.</P>
<P>Sir W. Canynge had al&s;o a cabinet of curio&s;ities, which he had collected with very great expence, and Rowley a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in making the collection. The greate&s;t part of a large folio was filled with his compo&s;itions. This folio, Rowley &s;ays. <Q REND="inline">"was a pre&s;ente wordie of a grete kynge;"</Q> and the lo&s;s of it will be &s;incerely regretted by the friends of literature, as the writings might have thrown &s;ome light on the learning of tho&s;e times. Can|ynge was al&s;o a man of an exten&s;ive genius, and a liberal turn of mind, the di&s;tingui&s;hed patron of literature, and a lover of the fine arts. Rowley, it appears by his writings, lived in the greate&s;t in|timacy with him, and received very extraordinary marks of his favour and genero&s;ity. On all occa|&s;ions he &s;hews his gratitude to his illu&s;trious friend, takes perpetual delight in dwelling on his many amiable virtues, and con&s;tanly manife&s;ts an earne&s;t de&s;ire of tran&s;mitting his fame to po&s;terity. This appears not only in many of his poems, but al&s;o in the following pro&s;e work, pre&s;erved by
<PB N="122" REF="152">
Chatterton, and printed in the Town and-Country Magazine for Nov. 1775, which, as a literary curio&s;ity, our readers, we doubt not, will be glad to &s;ee re-publi&s;hed here, with &s;everal corrections.

<P>"I was fadre confe&s;&s;or to ma&s;teres Roberte and ma&s;tre William Cannings. Ma&s;tre Robert was a man after his fadre's own harte, greedie of gaynes and &s;parynge of alms deedes; but ma&s;ter William was mickle courteous, and gave me many marks in my needs. At the age of 22 years deaces'd ma&s;ter Roberte, and by ma&s;ter William's de&s;yre bequeathd me one hundred marks; I went to thank ma&s;ter William for his mickle courte&s;ie, and to make tender of my&s;elfe to him.&mdash;Fadre quod he, I have a crotchett in my brayne, that will need your aide.

Con&s;ented I to the &s;ame, and pur&s;uant &s;ett outt he Mundaie following for the min&s;ter of our Ladie and Saint Goodwyne, where a drawing of a &s;teeple, contryvd for the belles when runge to &s;waie out of the &s;yde the ayre, had I thence; it was done by Syr Symon de Mambrie, who, in the trouble&s;omme rayne of kyng Stephen, devoted him&s;elfe, and was &s;horne.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITY OF CHRISTMAS GAMES.</HEAD>
<P>IN the days of our ance&s;tors, Chri&s;tmas was a period &s;acred to mirth and ho&s;pitality. Though not wholly neglected now, it cannot boa&s;t of the honours it once had; the veneration for religious &s;ea&s;ons fled with popery, and old Engli&s;h ho&s;pi|tality is long &s;ince decea&s;ed. Our modern play|things of fortune, who make the whole year a revolution of di&s;&s;ipation and joyle&s;s fe&s;tivity, cannot di&s;tingui&s;h this &s;ea&s;on; unle&s;s by re&s;ting from their laborious plea&s;ures, and (if they can think) find a happy &s;erenity in &s;olitude and reflection, un|known in the tumult of hurricanes.&mdash;The ancient Chri&s;tmas gambols were, in my opinion, &s;uperior to our modern &s;pectacles and amu&s;ements; wre&s;t|ling, hurling the ball, and dancing in the wood|lands, were plea&s;ures for men; it is true, the conver&s;ation of the hearth-fide was the tales of &s;u|per&s;tition:
<PB N="130" REF="160">
the fairies, Robin Goodfellow, and hobgoblins, never failed to make the trembling audience mutter an Ave Maria, and cro&s;s their chins; but the laughable exerci&s;es of blindman's buff, riddling, and que&s;tion and command, &s;uffi|ciently compen&s;ated for the &s;ew &s;udden &s;tarts of terror. Add to the&s;e amu&s;ements, the wretched voices of the chanters and &s;ub chanters; howling carols in Latin; the chiming of con&s;ecrated bells; the burning con&s;ecrated wax candles; curiou&s;ly repre&s;enting the Virgin Mary; praying the &s;aint who&s;e mona&s;tery &s;tood neare&s;t; the munching con|&s;ecrated cro&s;s-loaves, &s;old by the monks; all which effectually eradicated the &s;pectres of their terrific &s;tories. Nor were the&s;e the only charms again&s;t the foul fiends, and night-mare; &s;leeping cro&s;s-legged, like the effigies of Knights Templars, and warriors, and the holy bu&s;h and church-yard yew, were certain antidotes again&s;t tho&s;e invi&s;ible beings. After this repre&s;entation, I may be thought partial to my own hobby-hor&s;e, as an an|tiquary, in giving the preference to the amu&s;e|ments of the days of old; but let the &s;entimental reader con&s;ider that the tales of &s;uper&s;tition, when believed, affect the &s;oul with a &s;en&s;ation plea|&s;urably
<PB N="131" REF="161">
horrid; we may paint in more lively co|lours to the eye, they &s;poke to the heart.</P>
<P>The great barons and knights u&s;ually kept open hou&s;e during this &s;ea&s;on, when their villains, or va&s;&s;als, were entertained with bread, beef, and beer, and a pudding, wa&s;tol cake, or Chri&s;tmas kitchel, and a groat in &s;ilver at parting; being obliged, in return, to wave the full flaggon round their heads, in honour of the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. Sometimes the fe&s;tival continued, till Twelfth|day, when the baron, or his &s;teward, took the deis, or upper &s;eat of the table, and after dinner gave every man a new gown of his livery, and two Chri&s;tmas kitchels.&mdash;This kind of liberality, endeared the barons to the common people, and made them ever ready to take up arms under their banners.</P>
<P>A regi&s;ter of the nunnery of Keyn&s;ham relates, that William, earl of Gloce&s;ter, entertained two hundred knights with tilts and fortunys, at his great manor of Keyn&s;ham, provided thirty pies of the eels of Avon, as a curious dainty; and on the Twelfth-day began the plays for the knights
<PB N="132" REF="162">
by the monks; with miracles and maumeries for the henchmen and &s;ervants, by min&s;trels.</P>
<P>Here is plainly a di&s;tinction made between maumeries and miracles, and the more noble repre&s;entations comprehended under the name plays. The fir&s;t were the holiday entertainments of the vulgar; the other of the barons and nobi|lity. The private exhibitions at the manors of the barons, were u&s;ually family hi&s;tories, the monk, who repre&s;ented the ma&s;ter of the family, being arrayed in a tabard (or herald's coat without &s;leeves) painted with all the hatchments of the names. In the&s;e dome&s;tic performances ab&s;urdities were unavoidable; and in a play wrote by Sir Tib|bet Gonges, Con&s;tance, counte&s;s of Bretagne and Richmond, marries and buries her three hu&s;bands in the compa&s;s of an hour. Sometimes the&s;e pieces were merely relations, and had only two characters of this kind, as that in Weever's Fu|neral monuments. None but the patrons of mo|na&s;teries had the &s;ervice of the monks in perform|ing plays on holidays; provided the &s;ame con|tained nothing again&s;t God or the church. The public exhibitions were &s;uperior to the private; the plot, generally, the life of &s;ome pope, or the
<PB N="133" REF="163" MS="y">
founder of the abbey the monks belonged to. I have &s;een &s;everal of the&s;e pieces, mo&s;tly Latin, and cannot think our ance&s;tors &s;o ignorant of dra|matic excellence as the generality of modern writers would repre&s;ent: they had a good moral in view, and &s;ome of the maumeries abound with wit, which though low now was not &s;o then. Min|&s;trels, je&s;ters, and mummers, was the next cla&s;s of performers; every knight had two or thee min|&s;trels and je&s;ters, who were maintained in his hou&s;e, to entertain his family in their hours of di&s;&s;ipation; the&s;e Chancer mentions in the follow|ing pa&s;&s;ages:<Q><L>Doe comme, he &s;aied, myn myn&s;trales,</L>

<P>SCULPTURE is an art which, by de&s;ign and &s;olid matter, imitates the palpable objects of nature. It is difficult to a&s;certain the epocha of
<PB N="143" REF="174">
its origin; it is lo&s;t in the mo&s;t remote antiquity. The arts of imitation in general, as painting, ar|chitecture, &s;culpture, &amp;c. where the fir&s;t invent|ed. Sculptors began to work upon clay and wax, which are more flexible, and more pliable than wood and &s;tone. They &s;oon made &s;tatues of trees which were neither &s;ubject to corruption nor worms, as the lemon-tree, the cypre&s;s, the palm, the olive, the ebony, and the vine: at la&s;t they made u&s;e of metals, ivory, and the harde&s;t &s;tones; marble e&s;pecially became the mo&s;t precious matter, and the mo&s;t e&s;teemed for works of &s;culpture.</P>
<P>The nations among&s;t which this fine art was in the greate&s;t honour were the Aegyptians; tho&s;e people, &s;o celebrated by the monuments of their gratitude towards the memory of the kings their benefactors. It was to perpetuate their names, that they erected, in the earlie&s;t ages, the two Colo&s;&s;ean &s;tatues of Mocrus, and the queen his &s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Aegyptian &s;culptors excelled all others in exactne&s;s of proportion; the different parts of a &s;tatue were often formed by divers arti&s;ts; and the&s;e parts united made the whole perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="175">
The Greek hi&s;torians boa&s;t of the invention of that art in their country, which they attribute to love: however, it is certain that the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of &s;culpture in Greece were very unpoli&s;hed; but De|dalus, having travelled into Aegypt, improved him&s;elf in this art, and formed afterwards pupils who became the admiration of a people who&s;e ta&s;te was not yet refined by the elegant &s;tatues of Phydias, Myron, Ly&s;ippus, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Greeks, &s;ubdued by the Romans, degene|rated in&s;en&s;ibly; and the arts vani&s;hed with their freedom.</P>
<P>Sculpture was an exotic which never could thrive in victorious Rome; its tran&s;ient glory was eclip&s;ed by the other arts in the reign of Augu&s;tus; it declined under Tiberius, Caius, and Claudius; and re-appeared with an enormous magnitude un|der Nero.</P>
<P>The Gothic &s;culpture &s;prung afterwards from a wild imagination, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by nature.</P>
<P>The epocha of &s;culpture is the &s;ame in France and Italy. The celebrated Michael Angelo work|ed
<PB N="145" REF="176">
in Rome under the pontificate of Leo X. whil&s;t John Goujon was admitted at Paris, under the pa|tronage of Francis I.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h advanced by &s;low degrees to the perfection of that art, in which they now rival their ancient ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The &s;culptors gave the name of &s;tatue to a figure in embo&s;&s;ed work, that &s;tands by it&s;elf in wood, &s;tone, marble, or metal, of per&s;ons con&s;picuous by their birth, their rank, or their merit.</P>
<P>The ancients often repre&s;ented figures of men, kings, and even gods, under a &s;pecies of &s;tatues &s;maller than the natural &s;ize.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of per&s;ons who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by their &s;uperior knowledge, their virtues, or &s;ome important &s;ervices to the commonwealth, were erected at the public expence in &s;tatues of hu|man &s;ize.</P>
<P>The third &s;pecies of &s;tatues was de&s;igned for kings and emperors: they were taller than men
<PB N="146" REF="177">
commonly are; and tho&s;e which per&s;onated he|roes were larger in proportion.</P>
<P>As for the Colo&s;&s;ean &s;tatues, they repre&s;ented gods; and often kings and emperors, de&s;irous to magnify them&s;elves by the&s;e &s;tupendous works, reared at their own expence monuments of their vanity and folly.</P>
<P>An eque&s;trian &s;tatue exhibits a man on hor&s;e|back; as the &s;tatue of Charles I. at Charing-cro&s;s; the &s;tatue of Henry IV. at Paris; and that of Co&s;|mo de Medicis, at Leghorn.</P>
<P>A Greek &s;tatue is naked and antique; thus called, becau&s;e the Greeks di&s;played in that man|ner the gods, the heroes, and the athlets of the Olympic games.</P>
<P>The Roman &s;tatues are all repre&s;ented with a drapery.</P>
<P>A mau&s;oleum is a pompous funeral monument, decorated with &s;culpture and architecture, with an epitaph &s;acred to the memory of &s;ome con&s;iderable per&s;onage. It derives its etymology from the
<PB N="147" REF="178">
magnificent tomb, which Queen Artemi&s;a cau&s;ed to be erected for Mau&s;olus, king of Caria, her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Heroes, patriots, and &s;tate&s;men, are not only en|titled to the love and veneration of their cotempo|raries during their lives, but their virtues and &s;er|vices ought to be tran&s;mitted to the late&s;t po&s;terity. This vanity of &s;urviving our du&s;t by la&s;ting mo|numents of national gratitude, has prompted men to the mo&s;t noble actions, and in&s;pired them with the emulation of being enrolled in the records of time, with tho&s;e great heroes who&s;e &s;tatues and in&s;criptions they contemplate with a &s;ort of extacy. The tombs of We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey fill the mind with that awful reverence, which a magnificent and grateful nation te&s;tifies for its benefactors. The portraits of the illu&s;trious warriors who have &s;ubdued our inveterate enemies in both hemi|&s;phered, expo&s;ed to public view in Vauxhall-gar|dens, create even in a di&s;&s;ipated multitude a kind of admiration greatly &s;uperior to that in&s;pired by the enchantment of the place. The &s;pirit and magnamanity of the incorruptible Beckford, &s;o becoming the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the metropolis of a powerful empire; his noble and animated &s;peech
<PB N="148" REF="179">
to the throne, which was the la&s;t public te&s;timony of his unwearied zeal for his country's cau&s;e, will be echoed with applau&s;e at the &s;ight of his &s;tatue by the &s;ucceeding generation, to whom he tried to tran&s;mit our con&s;titution re&s;tored to its pri&s;tine pu|rity.</P>

<HEAD>ADVENTURES OF A STAR.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall omit the minute pa&s;&s;ages of my life, which happened whil&s;t my members were in a &s;tate of &s;eparation, and begin my hi&s;tory where I began to &s;ee the polite world&mdash;in the laceman's &s;hop.

Here I liv|ed in a &s;tate of inactivity for above a month, and heard nothing but the u&s;ual di&s;cour&s;e of trade; when one day a couple of pretty ladies hurried into the &s;hop, from a coach dignified with a coronet. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Mr. Spangle, we want to take a view of the newe&s;t patterns you have.

The next di&s;cour&s;e of any con&s;equence happened between Mr. Spangle and his &s;on. Jack Spangle was as complete a city buck as any who &s;requent the Park when the &s;un &s;hines. He &s;poke an anglici&s;ed French very &s;lu|ently; and murdered an overture upon the violin to admiration. <Q REND="inline">"Jack (&s;aid the old gentleman to him one day, when the ungracious &s;pendthrift had made application for t'other bank bill) the&s;e wild cour&s;es will never do.

<P>After lying in the &s;hop three months and four days, (I always endeavour to be preci&s;e in my chronology, as it gives the reader a&s;&s;urance, that the hi&s;tory is really and <HI>bona fide,</HI> true) one of my rays by an accident, began to be a little tarni&s;hed: this was a terrible misfortune, as in con&s;equence of it, I was degraded to the gla&s;s-ca&s;e at the door. I now gave way to the mo&s;t violent emotionsof de|&s;pair, and thought my &s;plendor irretrievable; &s;aw all my hopes of ri&s;ing in the polite world vani&s;hed; and expected never to be relieved, till the day of tran&s;mu|tation, from my di&s;graceful &s;ituation. But fate had kinder days in &s;tore for me. The fir&s;t object that claimed my attention in the &s;treet, was the &s;uperb chair of Mrs. Spermacety, the wax-chandler's wife. Her chairmen were loaded with &s;ilver lace; and the footman who cleared the way, had an enormous bag wig. I expected to have &s;een it filled with the dignity of a duche&s;s; but how great was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when I perceived a &s;hort, fat woman, of the &s;ame complexion as the &s;ign of the Saracen's Head fa&s;tened in it! She was dre&s;&s;ed meanly rich, without the &s;hadow of ele|gance
<PB N="153" REF="184">
in any thing but her chair, which had for|merly belonged to a lady of quality, having pur|cha&s;ed it at her decea&s;e. Her &s;neaking pitiful countenance did not di&s;cover one grain of genero|&s;ity or nobility: &s;he appeared an ab&s;olute burle&s;que on the grandeur which &s;urrounded her. The fol|lowing dialogue between Mr. Spangle and his good friend and neighbour Mr. Pickle let me into her whole hi&s;tory. <Q REND="inline">"Good morning to you, neigh|bour Spangle, as the man &s;aid; methinks Mrs. Spermaceti &s;hines to-day."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"She &s;hines every day, at home and abroad, Mr. Pickle: but there may be rea&s;ons for it; and the grey mare is &s;ome|times the better hor&s;e."</Q> This &s;troke, though in my opinion not very brilliant, brought a hor&s;e|laugh on both &s;ides for about ten minutes. <Q REND="inline">"You are a wit, neighbour, you are a wit; but they &s;ay, as how, that Mrs. Spermaceti was formerly her hu&s;band's cook-maid; but lies and &s;now-balls gather in rolling; pray is there any truth in the matter?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Between our&s;elves, there is a great deal of truth in it; and the fir&s;t charm that Mr. Spermaceti found in his &s;pou&s;e, was that &s;he dre&s;|&s;ed ortolans to a miracle."</Q> Another loud laugh of applau&s;e echoed to the end of the &s;treet. <Q REND="inline">"And they &s;ay, Mr. Spangle, as how, that &s;he lo&s;t three
<PB N="154" REF="185">
thou&s;and pounds one night at the gaming table to lord what-ye-callum&mdash;lord Dillitanti; is that true?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Very true, upon my word; for Tom Shamwell, who now lives by his wit, &s;tood be|hind her chair, to let him into her hand, as they call it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well, the Lord help us all, it is a &s;ad thing to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e a &s;pending wife, who con&s;umes all the money before we gets it."</Q></P>
<P>This edifying di&s;cour&s;e was terminated by a hearty &s;hake of the hand, and an invitation from both parties to partake of a bottle of wine. I had now remained expo&s;ed to public view for about three weeks, and had caught the eye of every &s;taring countryman, who did honour to my fal|len brightne&s;s, by exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Odzounds! what a woundy pretty thingamy!"</Q> Fortune at la&s;t began to &s;mile, and my deliverance from di&s;|grace was effected in the following manner.</P>
<P>Father L'Andridella was at the time of the in|tended a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the king of Portugal trea&s;u|rer to a principal college of the order of Je&s;us, in the city of Li&s;bon. He was the intimate friend and con&s;idant of Malagrida; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in compo&s;ing tho&s;e ridiculous whim&s;ies which the In|qui&s;ition
<PB N="155" REF="186">
condemned as heretical. He was al&s;o deep in the important &s;ecret; and when the con|&s;piracy began to unravel, was happy enough to e&s;cape the flames which Malagrida and the other con&s;pirators peri&s;hed in. The inhumanity with which the innocent families of the only two noble con&s;pirators were treated, is too &s;hocking to be dwelt upon.</P>
<P>Andridella went fir&s;t to Paris, where he was em|ployed by St. Florentin to bear certain pre&s;ents to certain mini&s;ters in England, on a pacific account: but he demanding more for his trouble than St. Florentin cho&s;e to give, he was threatened with being confined for life in the Ba&s;tile; which threat would have been actually carried into execution, had he not timely got away to England.</P>
<P>How a certain phy&s;ician came by his intelli|gence, &s;hall be known in due time.</P>
<P>Andridella, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, &s;hifted his habit, and equipped him&s;elf as a pedlar. Being a man of an exten&s;ive genius, and great knowledge in chemi&s;try, he prepared &s;everal tinc|tures, for taking &s;pots out of linen, recovering
<PB N="156" REF="187">
tarni&s;hed gold or &s;ilver, and other ingenious <HI>mi|nutiae.</HI> In one of his diurnal rotations, he called on Mr. Spangle, and imparted to him the virtues of his box. I was accordingly taken down to bear witne&s;s to the excellence of his tincture; and on the touch of his bru&s;h moi&s;tened by it &s;hone forth with redoubled lu&s;tre, which, by a natural &s;ympathy glittered al&s;o in the eyes of Mr. Spangle. Andridella was paid generou&s;ly, and I was once more carefully laid up in the &s;hop; but my &s;tay there was very &s;hort; for Mr. Buckram, the tay|lor, gave me the preference before twenty of my brethren, and fixed me to a magnificent &s;uit of cloaths, which were conveyed to B&mdash;n hou&s;e, for the u&s;e of a young d&mdash;, ju&s;t &s;tepped into his e&s;tate and title.</P>
<P>The duke of D&mdash;e was the nobleman upon who&s;e brea&s;t I commanded re&s;pect. Paracel&s;us, and that ingenious a&s;trologic phy&s;ician, Culpeper, a&s;&s;ert, that gold and &s;ilver have a magic virtue. The magic of this virtue, commercially con&s;ider|ed, is intere&s;t; phy&s;ically, it is chimerical; and metaphi&s;ically, it is a fine &s;ubtle genius or &s;pirit, as capable of rea&s;oning upon matter, as any dei&s;t &s;ince Bolingbroke. By the magic of my compo|&s;ition,
<PB N="157" REF="188">
I was enabled to look internally into the bo|&s;oms which I adorned externally, and had no rea|&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with my &s;ituation, as his grace's heart was no di&s;honour to his &s;tar. He was young, and had his foibles; the principal of which was a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for gaming. Rea&s;on in vain endeavoured to convince him of his error; had he been convinced, his re&s;olution would have been too feeble to bear him through in a reforma|tion. The fir&s;t time I adorned him, I vi&s;ited the court; after the levee was over, he was acco&s;ted by Lord Rattle, <Q REND="inline">"Ah, D&mdash;e, how the devil d'ye do to day? I was horridly dipp'd la&s;t night; thirteen bottles of champaigne, demme. Lord Shuffle was bit this morning of three thou&s;and; and has &s;ent to his &s;teward to cut down a whole fore&s;t to have a better &s;tock to proceed upon. Pray, have you &s;een C&mdash;d's Letters?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"O hor|rid! don't mention the &s;tuff; I &s;icken at the idea. Lady Bab Blouzy has had the vapours the&s;e five days by peru&s;ing as many lines. Nau&s;eous, 'pon 'onour: I always write my billets in French; a certain pre&s;ervative again&s;t vulgar critici&s;m!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Gad&s;o, you're right, my lord: but as I always thought writing pedantic and beneath a noble|man, my valet always writes my amorous epi&s;tles:
<PB N="158" REF="189">
and a fine fellow he is too! Trims a &s;entiment like a bag-wig, and twi&s;ts a meaning like a curl."</Q> I admired his lord&s;hips prudence, in making his valet a &s;ecretary, as it was more than probable he was better qualified for the office than his honour|able ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the evening, I accompanied the duke to the gaming-table; my lu&s;tre &s;ickened, and my whole frame trembled, at beholding the knot of ra&s;cals and villains, who &s;urrounded him. Some he honoured with a nod; and others he conde&s;cended to enter into a conver&s;ation with; and then with an air of carele&s;s indifference, &s;at down to play, and before he ro&s;e, lo&s;t above eight thou&s;and pounds. This lo&s;s but very little affected him, and he went home with the &s;ame compo&s;ure of mind he brought out with him. The &s;harpers who &s;hared the booty, were Sir Richard &mdash;, lord M&mdash;, Jack Houn&s;low, and father Andredilla, who&s;e in|genuity had rai&s;ed me to my pre&s;ent exalted &s;tation. Sir Richard had a legal claim to his title, but no man could di&s;grace it with more villanies or mean|ne&s;&s;es. His humble &s;oul &s;tooped to every thing when intere&s;t was in the way, and his tender con|&s;cience never gave him any trouble about the mat|ter.
<PB N="159" REF="190">
Though lord M&mdash;, and this con&s;cientious knight of the po&s;t, were continually quarrelling every were el&s;e, they always agreed at the gaming|table, in a very capital point, viz. to bubble his grace. His grace was &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o &s;uperficially learn|ed in the art of gambling, and his antagoni&s;ts &s;o cunning and deep in the my&s;tery, that B&mdash;n|hou&s;e was more than once on the verge of being &s;old, to pay the&s;e inpo&s;tors what the world calls debts of honour. Lord M&mdash;, who though young, yet enervated with plea&s;ure, had &s;till a hankering de&s;ire to be &s;acrificing on the altar of the Cytherean godde&s;s; and, by the infallibility of a bank-bill, had gained admittance into the chamber of Mi&s;s R&mdash;rs, the baronet's mi&s;tre&s;s. His lord&s;hip was making his addre&s;&s;es, when Sir Richard made his appearance: as the baronet was a man of prudence, and knew how to make u&s;e of an opportunity, he propo&s;ed to his lord&s;hip, that if he &s;hould be permitted to partake of the profits ari&s;ing from his grace, and an eminent Ea&s;t-India bubble, his lord&s;hip &s;hould partake in common with the baronet in the charms of Mi&s;s R&mdash;rs. Lord M&mdash; &s;tretched his gallantry to the utmo&s;t, and complied: and it was upon this con&s;ideration that the baronet had admittance to
<PB N="160" REF="191">
the gaming table. Jack Houn&s;low was his lord|&s;hip's under&s;trapper; he had been an uphol&s;terer, but having &s;quandered his &s;tock, and nothing be|ing left but a pair of pi&s;tols, he employed them to the mo&s;t profitable advantage, by levying contri|butions on the highway. The frequent executions of his fellow labourers &s;triking a damp upon his &s;pirits, and having now pretty well recruited his pockets, he gave up his hazardous employment and commenced &s;harper. Lord M&mdash; &s;oon di&s;|covered his inventive genius and u&s;eful parts, and engaged him in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Sir Kenelm Digby, who &s;o religiou&s;ly main|tained the doctrine of &s;ympathy, would have attri|buted his lord&s;hip's di&s;covery to &s;imilar feelings in his own brea&s;t. But as many tedious and learned arguments may be brought to maintain it, and to &s;ay but little in a ca&s;e of importance, is wor&s;e than nothing at all, and for other good cau&s;es and con|&s;iderations, I &s;hall leave it entirely to the reader.</P>
<P>Father Andredilla having acquired a con&s;iderable &s;um by his tinctures, put him&s;elf into a magni|ficent dre&s;s, hired three &s;ervants, and a&s;&s;uming the title of marquis de Villa Garcia, completed the
<PB N="161" REF="192">
party who were continually preying upon the inex|perience of the duke. One morning, lord Rattle came thundering in upon his grace, <Q REND="inline">"O, D&mdash;e, I &s;hall die with ri&s;ibility. Never was &s;uch a co|mical figure, demme; no ma&s;querade face can be half &s;o laughable. There's C&mdash;d gone to his trial, with a countenance as dejected as lord B&mdash;e's when at King&s;ton; and lady Harriet G&mdash;r, with a face as bronzed and as impudent as a naiad of Covent-Garden."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Pretty work, Rattle, and what d'ye think will be the i&s;&s;ue?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Between you and I, I have a very important &s;e|cret, and could I confide in your retentive facul|ties, by the Lord, I have no friend upon earth I would rather reveal it to."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"You may depend upon my honour, Jack; did I ever betray your in|e&s;timable &s;ecrets?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why then, D&mdash;e, it is ab&s;olutely determined, that when a divorce is ob|tained, C&mdash;d &s;hall po&s;itively marry lady Har|riet: I may confide in your honour now, I hope?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Undoubtedly,"</Q> replied his grace, &s;mothering a laugh, <Q REND="inline">"your &s;ecrets are of too much importance to be tri&s;led with."</Q> Lord Rattle's whi&s;pers had generally as much truth, as tho&s;e of a coffee-hou&s;e politician, who is happy in the acquaintance of a paragraph-maker.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="193">
I had lived with his grace long enough to &s;ee him bubbled out of thirty thou&s;and pounds, and was then configned, as a cu&s;tomary fee, to his valet, who immediately carried me to Monmouth|&s;treet, to take my chance with an army of decayed gentry; &s;ome of whom I had been acquainted with in their days of pro&s;perity. As I had lived my u&s;ual time among the great, I &s;ubmitted to my fate without murmuring. A black velvet coat and wai&s;tcoat, my near neighbours, were taken down to give phy&s;ical dignity to a young fellow who had newly commenced quack-doctor; and found out a no&s;trum to cure di&s;tempers which never exi&s;ted. This &s;uit had once adorned a genius of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e extraordinary operations in Moor|fields, had made him the envy of all Hatton-Gar|den. Doctor Bialini, the original wearer, was quite an E&s;culapius in his way; he was unac|quainted with every principle in &s;urgery: but hav|ing as much courage and impudence, as ignorance, he boldly undertook the mo&s;t difficult operations. When he happened to divide an artery in the cure of a &s;cratch, it was all very well; and he had di&s;covered by experience, that diverting the di&s;|temper to the nobler parts, was an infalliable cure, for incon&s;iderable ailments. He couched for the
<PB N="163" REF="194">
cataract, and where he cured one by chance, he made twenty totally blind, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of recovery. But &s;ucce&s;s did not always attend his adventure; a young lady of great family ap|plying to him to be ea&s;ed of a trouble&s;ome pain in the head, he gave her &s;uch a do&s;e of his cathartic pills, that &s;he expired under their operation. The friends of the decea&s;ed accu&s;ed the doctor of mur|der, and left it to his choice either to take a do&s;e of his own cathartics, or leave England to return no more. As he knew the merit of his medica|ments too well to chu&s;e the fir&s;t, he returned to Italy, to exerci&s;e his hone&s;ter occupation of a tay|lor. His &s;olemn habiliments were now di&s;po&s;ed of to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in fame, Mr. Perron, who had been educated a cobler, and on the merit of being twice &s;alivated, adverti&s;ed to cure a certain di&s;|temper in all its exten&s;ive branches. The regular &s;urgeons have had no rea&s;on to complain of his &s;ucce&s;s; as he has greatly increa&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the faculty, by confirming the di&s;ea&s;e, and ruin|ing the con&s;titution in every patient he undertook to cure. The warehou&s;e I was laid up in was greatly frequented by &s;econd-hand gentry, among whom I heard many entertaining di&s;cour&s;es, but too foreign from my purpo&s;e to be related here.
<PB N="164" REF="195">
A &s;ervant enquiring for a rich &s;uit with a &s;tar, I was accordingly taken down, approved of, and carried off. I wondered what u&s;e I was going to be put to, when a meagre tall old man made his appearance. <Q REND="inline">"Well done, my bra' bonny lad|die, this is &s;aving the &s;iller, and laying up more for the bairn."</Q> The&s;e words were uttered by the identical duke of A&mdash;, who putting on his pru|dent finery, &s;tepped into a coach, as antiquated as ho&s;pitality, and rattled off to court. The recep|tion he met with from his M&mdash;, would have &s;hamed virtue out of countenance: when we &s;ee villany and avarice care&s;&s;ed, what &s;hall we &s;ay, but that k&mdash;s are men. His only merit was in being born a Scot, and di&s;tantly related to lord B&mdash;. I had examined his brea&s;t, and found him nothing but a compo&s;ition of pride, fraud and avarice. As he was deep in all his favoured countryman's &s;ecrets, the affair of the peace was not unknown to him, and he had no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of the booty. Not contented with his &s;hare, he revealed the tran&s;action to a certain we&s;tern phy&s;ician, bind|ing him by oath, not to di&s;cover from whom he had his intelligence; and articling to receive a moiety of whatever &s;hould be given the doctor to
<PB N="165" REF="196">
&s;top his mouth, or &s;ay nothing at all to the purpo&s;e. The whole juggle was tran&s;acted entirely to the duke's &s;atisfaction: and he partook &s;o gloriou&s;ly of the hu&s;h-money, that for a moment emerging from his u&s;ual avarice; he gave his &s;ervants new liveries, and matched one of his hor&s;es, having before paired a bay and a black one. The nobi|lity did not receive him &s;o well as his M&mdash;; as he was univer&s;ally looked upon as a &s;candal to his title, he was &s;hunned by every polite company. Unfortunately, the too retentive memory of a gen|tleman, di&s;covered his grace's cloaths to have been worn by a more honourable nobleman; and having whi&s;pered his di&s;covery to lady Henrietta F&mdash;h. as a very great &s;ecret; it was known all over the town before the evening, that the duke of A&mdash; had been to court in the duke of D&mdash;'s ca&s;t-off cloaths. Nothing can expre&s;s the vexa|tion of the old duke; his pride, which had &s;tooped to his avarice, in the purcha&s;e of his pru|dent bargain, began, though too late, to have the pre-eminence; he ordered his &s;ervant to bear me back to Monmouth-&s;treet, and de&s;ire the frippery|man to refund the money, which he did, after deducting a guinea for the u&s;e of his magni|ficence.

<HEAD>To the <HI>Printer</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> MAGAZINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS there are few monthly productions &s;o uni|ver&s;ally read as your agreeable Mi&s;cellany, I have taken the liberty to beg the in&s;ertion of the following &s;hort account of my life, in which I &s;hall be as brief as po&s;&s;ible; and which, if you think proper to countenance, may be a means to warn others of my &s;ex from falling into the &s;ame unhappy &s;nares, which I now fatally experience have been my ruin.</P>
<P>My parents were people of &s;ome repute, for my father enjoyed a place under the government of upwards of two hundred pounds a year, be&s;ides a &s;mall e&s;tate in the country, which brought him in about a hundred and fifty pounds a year more. As I was their only daughter, they naturally took the be&s;t care of my learning that their income would permit, and I was &s;ent early to a boarding &s;chool, where I received the rudiments of a polite
<PB N="168" REF="199">
education, and made as great progre&s;s in French, mu&s;ic, &amp;c. as could rea&s;onably be expected.</P>
<P>I was in my thirteenth year when my father died of a fever, and as he had been no great oeco|nomi&s;t, and the e&s;tate which he enjoyed was to leave our family at his death, my poor mother and I were left without the lea&s;t re&s;ource. Grief for the lo&s;s of a tender and affectionate hu&s;band, &s;oon put an end to my mother's di&s;tre&s;s; and I was now the only one left to &s;uffer for the faults of my poor father's imprudence. It happened I had a near relation who was married to a gentleman of for|tune, who pitying my &s;ituation, took me home with her to be a companion. By the chearfulne&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition, and my univer&s;al a&s;&s;iduities to plea&s;e, I ingratiated my&s;elf &s;o much in the favour of my cou&s;in and Mr. M&mdash;, and received for it &s;uch convincing proofs of their friend&s;hip and de|&s;ire to make me happy, that I &s;oon forgot the lo&s;s I had &s;o lately &s;u&s;tained. Mr. and Mrs. M&mdash; were extremely good-natured and affable, and I enjoyed every felicity I could wi&s;h for in my de|pendent &s;tate. Unluckily for me, Mrs. M&mdash; was threatened with a con&s;umption, ju&s;t as I had attained my fifteenth year, which daily increa&s;ing,
<PB N="169" REF="200">
in about &s;ix months, terminated a life, the lo&s;s of which I have now the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to lament; but not before &s;he had recommended me to the care of Mr. M&mdash; in &s;uch terms that none but a wretch abandoned to all manner of villainy could have ever forgot.</P>
<P>I felt every emotion of grief which a heart truly &s;u&s;ceptible of gratitude could experience at &s;uch a &s;hock; but my concern was &s;oon alleviated by the a&s;&s;urances I received from my &s;urviving bene|factor of a continuance of that protection and e&s;|teem I had hitherto met with. By his genoro&s;ity I was rendered &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of his hou&s;e, and had every indulgence granted which I could expect. As he had no children, he took me frequently with him, for an airing in the chariot, and though I ob&s;erved his fondne&s;s for me, daily increa&s;e, I did not &s;uffer the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion to enter my brea&s;t. Being of an age in which young women are initi|ated in company, and as I was to move in a more genteel &s;phere, than formerly, I was no longer to be &s;upported in my pre&s;ent character, but at a con&s;iderable expence, &s;o that he &s;pared no co&s;t to make me appear &s;uitable to that rank in which he placed me.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="201">
By this &s;tratagem, which I did not at fir&s;t under|&s;tand, he filled me with additional tenderne&s;s and gratitude; compelled me to repo&s;e on him as my only &s;upport; and by my &s;en&s;e of his favour, and the de&s;ire of retaining it, di&s;po&s;ed me to unlimited complai&s;ances. At la&s;t the wretch took ad|vantage of the familiarity which he enjoyed as my relation, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which he exacted as my benefactor, to attempt the ruin of an orphan, whom his indulgence had melted, and his authority had &s;ubdued. Shocked at the ba&s;e|ne&s;s of his de&s;igns, I &s;ummoned all the courage which a weak woman could employ, and re&s;ented his behaviour with a becoming indignation. But in&s;tead of recoiling at the deed, he upbraided me with ingratitude, and mingled his artifices with menaces of total de&s;ertion, if I &s;hould continue to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>I was now completely depre&s;&s;ed, and though I had &s;een mankind enough to know the nece&s;&s;ity of outward chearfulne&s;s, I often withdrew to my chamber to vent my grief, and examine by what means I might e&s;cape perpetual mortification. The lo&s;s of my indulgent parents and kind cou&s;in were
<PB N="171" REF="202">

Unaccu&s;tomed and unexperienced to earn my bread in a menial capacity, I had no hopes le&s;t but &s;uch as might proceed from his future honour and genoro&s;ity. I &s;oon found my&s;elf cruelly de|ceived; no art or cunning was left untried to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e; the mo&s;t &s;ubtle prote&s;ta|tions of protection and maintenance were made u&s;e of, and a &s;olemn promi&s;e of marriage to &s;ilence all my fears.</P>
<P>Oh! Woman, woman, thy name is frailty!</P>
<P>Young and credulous, I &s;wallowed the glitter|ing bait, and fell an ea&s;y victim to the unruly pa&s;|&s;ion of an ungrateful wretch.</P>
<P>But, alas! When he found the con&s;equences attendant on our crime, which I tremble to relate, he not only refu&s;ed to fulfil his promi&s;e of mar|riage; but al&s;o abandoned me to all the pangs of recollection, and the frowns of a mercile&s;s world.
<PB N="172" REF="203">
Yet villain as he was, he did not turn me out of doors, till he had given me money to &s;upport me in tho&s;e moments of perturbation, which his pa&s;|&s;ion had forced me to &s;uffer; and an untimely birth at length relieved me from the anxieties of a mo|ther, though it left me under the &s;evere pre&s;&s;ures of infamy, and the painful pro&s;pect of approach|ing poverty.</P>
<P>Friends and acquaintances have now for&s;aken me, and I am reduced to the lot of tho&s;e unhappy beings, from whom many, who melt at the &s;ight of all other mi&s;ery, think it meritorious to with|hold relief; whom the rigour of virtuous indig|nation dooms to &s;uffer without complaint, and peri&s;h without regard; and whom I my&s;elf have formerly in&s;ulted in the pride of reputation, and &s;ecurity of innocence.</P>
<P>Let others, who read my &s;tory, be warned by my example; and however &s;pecious the pre|tence, avoid the con&s;equences. Let them con&s;ider that however &s;ecure they may think them&s;elves, they will have need of all their fortitude when put to the te&s;t. Whatever they may think of me,

<HEAD>To the <HI>Printer</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> MAGAZINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me, through the channel of your Magazine, to lay before the public, &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s of no common kind. Though it can afford me no plea&s;ure to recite the many &s;ufferings of a wretched victim to misfortune; yet, by my errors, others may be convinced that the way of virtue only, is the way to felicity. Born to an elevated rank in life, I was in&s;tructed rather to value my|&s;elf on the blind acqui&s;itions of fortune, and the tin&s;el of external accompli&s;hments, than on the more &s;olid and commendable qualifications of the mind. My years of infancy were marked by an infant pride; and the mercenary di&s;po&s;ition of me|nial &s;ervants did not fail to make the evil increa&s;e with my growth.</P>
<P>When I ju&s;t entered my &s;ixteenth year, I was initated into all the oeconomy of high life. Should the ru&s;tic or mercantile reader find fault with the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>oeconomy,</HI> when applicable to high life,

his ignorance is &s;een in the cen&s;ure. Dames of &s;pirit have their mean &s;avings; and a titled lady is as anxiou&s;ly avaricious in her way, as any plod|ding citizen who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure unite in gain. Mo&s;t of the e&s;tates of our nobility are heavily mortgaged, or lie u&s;ele&s;s to the owner, till the rent clears the incumbrances; this is all that can be urged in defence of a lady of quality's &s;harping upon her &s;ervant, and &s;lripping her fille de chambre of all her ready ca&s;h, to an&s;wer &s;ome urgent demand upon her honour; which &s;he pro|te&s;ts, by that &s;acred honour, &s;hall be returned with intere&s;t in a few days. But, alas! Among quality, things equally as &s;acred as honour are abu&s;ed and trifled with. If there is any real &s;pirit in high life, any generous indifference as to the affairs of this world, which &s;hould con&s;titute the &s;ole merit of <HI>noble&s;&s;e,</HI> it is oftener found in a citizen's wife. However the court may exclaim again&s;t the city, there is le&s;s mercenary meanne&s;s in the dames of Ludgate-Hill, than in a whole ma&s;querade of right honourable di&s;honourables</P>
<P>But to return to my own &s;tory. Happy in the notion of the world, by being born to a title and a large fortune, it is not to be doubted that the
<PB N="176" REF="207">
coxcombs of the court were bu&s;y to ingratiate them|&s;elves in my favour, by genteely letting me know, they thought them&s;elves very pretty fellows; &s;ome indeed went &s;o far, as to a&s;&s;ure me by the <HI>lard,</HI> and all that, that I was con&s;umedly hand&s;ome, &s;till keeping a di&s;tant view to the dear &s;ubject, &s;elf; and never lending a compliment, unle&s;s it might be returned to the maker. The&s;e &s;hadows of men were my continual torment, being my &s;et|tled, perhaps, prejudiced aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s of lovers de&s;erved rather my friend|&s;hip, or my pity, than my love, the&s;e were men of &s;en&s;e, who, by the malice of their fortune, (or their &s;tars, if you are an a&s;trologer) had never ri&s;en in life to what their ambitious ideas a&s;pired to.</P>
<P>As the cu&s;toms of the world are, by the cour|te&s;y of it, allowed to be ju&s;t, the&s;e men imagined every girl of con&s;picuous accompli&s;hments, who&s;e unexperienced heart they could deceive into love, their lawful prize. Dangerous is that lover who has more &s;en&s;e than virtue: his &s;en&s;e, when per|verted, is the greate&s;t evil he can po&s;&s;e&s;s. Fools are mere cyphers, they are like the air; when the arrow flies, no traces remain to tell its way; they
<PB N="177" REF="208">
are like the &s;ea, where every &s;ingle impre&s;&s;ion is lo&s;t in multitudes of impre&s;&s;ions. Though I ea&s;ily defended my&s;elf again&s;t the egoti&s;ms and addre&s;&s;es of the coxcomb, I found it no ea&s;y ta&s;k to ward off the a&s;&s;aults of the man of &s;en&s;e; his batteries are levelled at the heart, and where he has mutual youth to plead in his favour, &s;eldom fails of car|rying the day. In the early bloom of life, we are not our&s;elves; and I confe&s;s, had not pride been a more certain guard than virtue, my fortune would have fallen into the hands of the creditors of an unfortunate, but amorous author. How|ever, this was an error of youth; and the pa&s;&s;ion fled with my experience and the ab&s;ence of the bard. But, my God! Why did it fly! To make room for one which &s;hould torment me for years. Better had it been for me to live poor by the vil|lany of another, than to be rich, great, and mi&s;e|rable by my own villany. But ju&s;t heavens! I de&s;erve it all.</P>
<P>I was in my nineteenth year, when the per&s;onal accompli&s;hments of a young gentleman, of inferior rank and fortune to mine, a Mr. Knowles, fir&s;t en|gaged my notice. I cannot &s;ay, I conceived a pa&s;&s;ion in&s;tantaneou&s;ly for him; I was never &s;o
<PB N="178" REF="209">
romantic. I admired his manly figure, his ea&s;y air, and affable behaviour. In &s;hort, I wi&s;hed to know him, which was going as far as a woman of prudence, could go upon fir&s;t &s;ight. I was then univer&s;ally allowed to be a beauty; and was unhappy enough to engage his attention. If his per&s;on plea&s;ed, his conver&s;ation charmed me; I was now madly in love. A &s;olid judgment, without the lea&s;t cynical ca&s;t; a florid, ea&s;y manner of &s;peech, without the lea&s;t affectation; and a fluent tongue, without any impertinence, all in&s;pired to make me &s;o. From the minute of our conver|&s;ation, we began an acquaintance, an ill-fated one for me. Mr. Knowles had never &s;poke of his pa&s;&s;ion, though his fine eyes expre&s;&s;ed unutterable things: we were often together, and I did not think it an unhappy circum&s;tance that no declara|tion had been made; for that chilling coldne&s;s, which, by the cu&s;tom of the world, nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceeds a declaration, till the matrimonial act is determined, mu&s;t, to mutual lovers, be a ceremo|nious torment. In the en&s;uing &s;pring, Mr. Knowles being in the country, as I was one morning playing on my harp&s;ichord, my fa|ther came ha&s;tily into the room. <Q REND="inline">"My dear girl,"</Q> &s;aid he, throwing his arm round my wai&s;t,
<PB N="179" REF="210">
<Q REND="inline">"I am overjoyed; partake of my tran&s;ports, and ea&s;e one part of them."</Q></P>
<P>I replied, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever gives my father joy, mu&s;t con&s;equently be welcome to me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is in your power,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"in your power alone, to in&s;ure this happine&s;s to me. The earl of &mdash; has &s;een you; he likes, he loves you: he has this day offered propo&s;als to me, and will &s;ettle more than your own fortune on you."</Q></P>
<P>I was thunder-&s;truck at this intelligence; I could hear no more: I fainted. My father was frighted; he called for help, and &s;oon recovered me. Seeing me revive, he changed his tender &s;olicitude to rage; called me an ungrateful, vile, di&s;obedient wretch, in having engaged my affec|tions to another, which he was &s;ure was the ca&s;e, without his con&s;ent; told me, I &s;hould marry his lord&s;hip in three days time, or turn out of his doors with nothing but what I could demand. Saying this, he flung out of the room, and left me to con&s;ult with Janet, my waiting woman, who was privy to my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of Mr.
<PB N="180" REF="211">
Knowles. <Q REND="inline">"Oh, Janet!"</Q> I exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"was ever poor creature &s;o &s;uddenly plunged into the depth of mi&s;ery!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, to be &s;ure, madam,"</Q> returned &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"the matter is a little &s;udden; but as to mi&s;ery, I have heard your honourable father &s;ay, that happine&s;s and mi&s;ery were both in our own hands. Suppo&s;e, madam, this affair had not hap|ened, would you ever have had Mr. Knowles?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No!"</Q> replied I warmly, <Q REND="inline">"No! I would never have &s;tooped below my birth."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why then, dear madam, if he is out of the que&s;tion, who could you have better than an earl? It is true, he is old, but then you will have a man of quality, and have all your own fortune &s;ettled on you. For my part, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on to he&s;itate."</Q> Weak as the&s;e rea&s;ons may appear, it was &s;uch cogency of argument that urged me to con&s;ent to be counte&s;s of &mdash;. Doubting the &s;tability of the re&s;olution, I ha&s;tened to put it into execution; and in one fatal minute did what ages of repent|ance could not undo. My lord was affable and kind; my father tran&s;ported out of him&s;elf; and I was neither mi&s;erable nor happy, in a kind of negative exi&s;tence, which, for want of a better name, we call the vapours, a latitudinary word, which, meaning every thing, means nothing.
<PB N="181" REF="212">
Mr. Knowles heard of our marriage: he flew on the wings of love. As I was &s;itting alone in my parlour, amu&s;ing my&s;elf with fruitle&s;s repentance, he bur&s;t in upon me, and giving me an inexpre&s;|&s;ible look, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, my Fanny!"</Q> That &s;hort &s;entence, did more, than the bittere&s;t re|proach could have done: it threw me into agonies not to be de&s;cribed. At la&s;t I gathered &s;trength enough to &s;peak. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, &s;ince the laws of the world have have bound me to another, to whom my kind regards are due, they cannot now be yours."</Q> This I murmured in articulations &s;carce to be under&s;tood: I knew not what I &s;aid. He &s;tarted from his chair, and eagerly &s;eizing my hand, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"And was there ever a po&s;&s;ibi|lity they could be mine!"</Q> This reply embarra&s;&s;ed me greatly; I was all confu&s;ion and hurry, when my lord entered.</P>
<P>Nothing can paint the di&s;traction of his features; lunacy it&s;elf could not be more enraged; he fiercely commanded Mr. Knowles to walk out of the hou&s;e, without permitting him to &s;peak, and returned to me with the countenance of a fury. <Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"could you carry on your vile intrigues no where but in my hou&s;e! But I
<PB N="182" REF="213">
will take care for the future, you &s;hall have no in|trigues el&s;ewhere."</Q> Saying this, he left me, and never afterwards &s;uffered me to &s;tir out, but with an old woman, who &s;erved me in the office of a duenna.</P>
<P>Vexed at this barbarous treatment, I re&s;ented it like a woman of quality and &s;pirit. I in&s;i&s;ted on the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of my &s;py, and being left to my own liberty. This his lord&s;hip flatly refu&s;ed. Madening with rage, I made an immediate a&s;&s;ig|nation with Mr. Knowles, exerted my authority, &s;ent back my guard, and flew in my own coach to the place of appointment.</P>
<P>When a woman has taken one fal&s;e &s;tep, 'tis too late to think of receding; &s;he is nece&s;&s;itated to go on. Jealou&s;y is certainly the effect of love; yet it is a very trouble&s;ome effect, and only tends to make the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or hated by the object he loves.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band's behaviour grew intolerable, and I was determined to leave him. This I did &s;oon after with Mr. Knowles, and we retired to a neighbouring kingdom. Happy in not being di&s;|turbed, we thought his lord&s;hip &s;at ea&s;y under his
<PB N="183" REF="214">
lo&s;s; when the fir&s;t intelligence we had of him brought his will. Di&s;tracted at the fatal con&s;e|quence of my re&s;entment, I flew to the hou&s;e once his, now mine, his genero&s;ity having left me all, laying the blame on the di&s;parity of our ages, my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and his jealou&s;y. Here had I the unhappine&s;s to find my father dying, &s;tabbed to the heart with the news of my flight. O, my God! what an everla&s;ting hell of reflection mu&s;t attend the guilty.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE man who &s;its down to write his own hi&s;tory, has no very agreeable ta&s;k to exe|cute. The chevalier Taylor is the only egoti&s;t &s;ince Julius Cae&s;ar, who has made tolerable work in drawing the picture of him&s;elf. Julius had but two colours to paint with, truth and cla&s;&s;ic ele|gance: here the chevalier had the advantage, for he was too great to be confined within the bounds of the fir&s;t qualification, and has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> with a thou&s;and materials. The &s;entimental John Bun|cle &s;hould not be forgotten: the man who admires the mountains of the north in his de&s;cription, will lo&s;e all his admiration in the real pro&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="216">
But to proceed to my own affairs. I am, Mr. Editor, a Sad Dog, a very Sad Dog; have run through many &s;ad adventures, had many &s;ad e&s;capes from the clutches of baliffs, and at the time of writing this &s;ad relation, am throned in a broken chair within an inch of a thunder-cloud.</P>
<P>I &s;et out in life with a fortune of five thou&s;and pounds, which the old prig, my father, left me, with this memorable piece of advice: <Q REND="inline">"Item, I leave to my younge&s;t &s;on Henry, five thou&s;and pounds, with an old book, formerly his grandmo|ther Bridget's, called, The Way to &s;ave Wealth, containing a thou&s;and choice receipts in cookery, &amp;c. and I advi&s;e that he read two pages of the &s;aid book every day before he dines."</Q> Very pretty advice! but I had not veneration enough for the parental character to follow it.</P>
<P>When the legacy was paid me, I bid my brother adieu, drank three bottles of claret with Sir Sten|tor Ranger, who had married my &s;i&s;ter, and drove furiou&s;ly to the metropolis in my own phaeton and &s;our. Honour was the only book which I ever honoured with a peru&s;al; and being pretty well dipped in the theory of gambling, I ventured to
<PB N="186" REF="217">
engage with &s;ome knights of the po&s;t, which were a little better ver&s;ed in the practical part, and at one &s;itting lo&s;t one fifth of my fortune. This was a terrible &s;troke to me, and I began, for the fir&s;t time in my life, to reflect; but a bottle of champaigne, and a night at the hotel, drove every trouble&s;ome idea out of my head.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fanny H&mdash;t, who by a natural tran&s;i|tion is tran&s;migrated from a whore into a bagnio|keeper, was then in the bloom of her charms; &s;he was never a fir&s;t-rate beauty, but always a ve|ry favourite toa&s;t among the bucks and pretty fel|lows of the city.</P>
<P>I was one evening &s;trolling the Park, when Mi&s;s Fanny had experience enough to perceive that &s;he had nailed my attention. As I was neither ac|quainted with her character, or &s;ituation, I was not a little elated with the conde&s;cending glances &s;he honoured me with. Pre&s;uming on my con|que&s;t, I made her a few compliments, '&s;quired her out of the Park, and thought my&s;elf ble&s;t in being permitted to accompany her to her lodgings. I had not enjoyed my t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te five minutes, be|fore I was a&s;toni&s;hed at hearing the well-known
<PB N="187" REF="218">
thunder of the voice of Jack N&mdash;tt. <Q REND="inline">"'Sblood and 'oons, you old harridan, &s;he is mine for a month; and I would rather lo&s;e fifty per cent. than lend her for a &s;ingle night to the deare&s;t friend upon earth."</Q> To this vociferous exclamation the venerable matron replied: <Q REND="inline">"Won't Mi&s;s Kitty do for once, or Polly, or Mi&s;s Nancy?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I'll have no Mi&s;s, but Fanny, by G&mdash;,"</Q> replied Jack, bur&s;ting into the parlour upon us. I was now &s;ufficiently in the &s;ecret, and not di&s;plea&s;ed at find|ing my charmer no ve&s;tal. Jack, who had paid fifty pounds for his month, in&s;i&s;ted on his right of purcha&s;e; but Mi&s;s Fanny thinking me a better pay-ma&s;ter, heroically turned him out of the par|lour; telling him, for his comfort, that he &s;hould have his month another time. Mi&s;s Fanny plea&s;|ed me &s;o well, that before I was weary of her I had &s;unk another thou&s;and; when, in a fit of re|flexion, I bid her adieu, and left her to Jack, and the re&s;t of her monthly keepers.</P>
<P>To make a little digre&s;&s;ion, I think this method of hiring for a month preferable to the whole&s;ale bargains for life, and of mutual advantage to the keeper and kept, if that form will &s;tand good in law, for a man will find it all rapture and love,
<PB N="188" REF="219">
without di&s;gu&s;t; and in a few months play the the &s;ame part over again, with no decay of vi|gour.</P>
<P>Jack N&mdash;tt is now a principal merchant, and rolls about in his coach and four to every public dinner; where his appetite and &s;olidity of judg|ment, in the edible way, does honour to the city. It is notorious that he is a cuckold, and by more than one method free of his company; but that is no detriment to him in the &s;cale of mercantile me|rit. The extraordinary bu&s;tle he has made in a late political affair, is very little to his advantage; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in his defence, that the earl of H&mdash;l&s;b&mdash;h did him the greate&s;t act of friend|&s;hip mortal man could do him, viz. invited him to a turtle-fea&s;t, and revealed to him a &s;ecret in the culinary art, till then utterly unknown to all the world but his lord&s;hip and his cook. Some in|deed pretended to &s;ay, that this &s;ecret is nothing more than giving veni&s;on an additional flavour, by ba&s;ting it with a preparation of French chee&s;e and rancid butter; but as I would not pre&s;ume to give my opinion in a matter of &s;uch importance, I &s;hall leave Jack to the plea&s;ure of the table, and proceed in my relation.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="220">
On this con&s;iderable decay of my fortune, I be|gan to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly of my departed father's curious advice; and in con&s;equence of this con|&s;ideration, re&s;olved to &s;et up for a fortune-hunter, and retrieve my affairs in the &s;ober track of matri|mony. A Mi&s;s L&mdash;n was the girl I had fixed up|on, and accordingly dre&s;&s;ed at. She rai&s;ed my hopes, and gratified my vanity by &s;everal &s;ignificant glances; and I was &s;o certain of carrying her off in the end, that I chearfully launched out five hundred pounds in dre&s;s and equipage; which had &s;uch an amazing effect, that in three weeks time I had three ki&s;&s;es of her hand, and in the fourth week &s;he took a trip to Scotland with her fa|ther's footman. This unexpected &s;troke created in me an ab&s;olute aver&s;ion to matrimony, and a re&s;o|lution not to endeavour to better my&s;elf by the hymenial knot.</P>
<P>Soon after this affair I made an acquaintance with the wife of an alderman: I &s;hall conceal his name, as his patriotic behaviour has rendered him re&s;pectable in the city. Mrs. &mdash; was of an amorous complexion: her hu&s;band had too much of the citizen to be like her: turtle, veni&s;on, and popularity, were the only objects of his attention,

out of the compting-hou&s;e. Though he has ne|ver repeated three periods with propriety, except when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ingenious device of placing the ready-made &s;peech in the crown of his hat; yet his mercantile genius has often &s;truck upon very lucky hits. He is unrivalled in reckoning the amount of rate per cent. and no &s;tock-broker at Jonathan's can whi&s;per a piece of &s;ecret intelli|gence with half his dexterity. Between you and I and the po&s;t, Mr. Editor, the &s;topping the circu|lation of bad halfpence, incon&s;iderable as the coin may appear to &s;ome, has brought him in no le&s;s than &s;even thou&s;and pounds, and increa&s;ed the trade of him and his partners amazingly.</P>
<P>Mrs. &mdash; had penetration enough to find out my good qualities; and you will &s;uppo&s;e, that I was not wanting in acknowledging her partiality. We had frequent interviews at the hou&s;e of a ca|pital miliner in the Strand, and the amour for &s;ome time went &s;wimmingly on.</P>
<P>Mrs. &mdash; was under no apprehen&s;ions of my being &s;atiated with enjoyment? for generou&s;ly con&s;idering I was but a younger brother, I never &s;acrificed on the altar of the Cyprean godde&s;s,
<PB N="191" REF="222">
without receiving a bank-bill worth my accep|tance. But, alas! happine&s;s is of &s;hort duration; or, to &s;peak in the language of the high-&s;ounding O&s;&s;ian, <Q REND="inline">"Behold! thou art happy; but &s;oon, ah! &s;oon, wilt thou be mi&s;erable. Thou art as ea&s;y and tranquil as the face of the green-mantled pud|dle; but &s;oon, ah! &s;oon, wilt thou be tumbled and to&s;&s;ed by misfortunes, like the &s;tream of the water-mill.

So the &s;un ri&s;ing in the ea&s;t gilds the borders of the black mountains, and laces with his golden rays the dark-brown heath. The hind leaps over the &s;lowery lawn, and the reeky bull rolls in the bubbling brook. The wild boar makes ready his armour of defence. The inhabitants of the rocks dance, and all na|ture joins in the &s;ong. But &s;ee! riding on the wings of the wind, the black clouds fly. The noi&s;y thunders roar; the rapid lightnings gleam; the rainy torrents pour, and the dropping &s;wain flies over the mountain: &s;wift as Bicker&s;taff, the &s;on of &s;ong, when the mon&s;ter Bumbailiano, keep|er of the dark and black cave, pur&s;ued him over the hills of death, and the green meadows of dark men."</Q> O, O&s;&s;ian! immortal genius! what an in|vocation

could I make now! but I &s;hall leave it to the abler pen of Mr. Duff, and &s;pin out the thread of my own adventures.</P>
<P>Mrs. &mdash; having di&s;patched a billet to me, I flew to her in her own hou&s;e. The knight, as &s;he thought, was fixed to the table of Sir Tunbelly Grains, knight, citizen, and alderman, who had invited him to dinner on a delicious tur|tle: a ble&s;&s;ing not to be neglected. But, Oh! grief of griefs! the knight having forgot his fa|vourite tobacco-box, popped in upon us unex|pectedly, and found us too familiarly engaged. In&s;tead of bur&s;ting into the rage which might have animated an Italian or Spaniard on the occa&s;ion, he &s;hook his head, and pronouncing coolly, <Q REND="inline">"Ve|ry fine, all very fine!"</Q> he left us, and returned to Sir Tunbelly to fini&s;h the turtle. As by his ha&s;ty throwing open the door he had expo&s;ed us to the view of two of his &s;ervants, I was terribly afraid of a pro&s;ecution for <HI>crim. con.</HI> for though it was as fa&s;hionable then as it is now, I was not very eager to lo&s;e the remainder of my fortune fa&s;hionably. But the knight con&s;idering his repu|tation would receive a &s;evere &s;troke, &s;hould the af|fair be made public, contented him&s;elf with de|manding
<PB N="193" REF="224">
two thou&s;and pounds for the injury I had done him. As he threatened to pro&s;ecute for lar|ger damages, unle&s;s I complied, I was obliged to refund more than Mrs. &mdash;'s bounty had be|&s;towed upon me.</P>
<P>The old curmudgeon had heartily provoked me, and I re&s;olved, though at the expence of every &s;hil|ling I had, to be revenged on him. For this pur|po&s;e I publi&s;hed the whole affair, and the devil a&s;&s;i&s;ting my invention, I &s;truck upon another ex|pedient to gratify my vengeance.</P>
<P>The knight's elde&s;t daughter, Sabina, whom he had by a former wife, was a fine &s;prightly girl, and wanted nothing but the <HI>bon ton</HI> to render her perfectly accompli&s;hed; about eighteen, a remark|able fine complexion, and expre&s;&s;ive blue eyes. She was at the time of the unlucky di&s;covery with a relation in E&s;&s;ex: as I had formerly paid a few compliments to her beauty, which I had rea&s;on to &s;ay, without vanity, were not ill received, I in&s;tantly di&s;patched an epi&s;tle to her, the mo&s;t ten|der my imagination could dictate. It wrought the effect I de&s;igned, and &s;he returned an an&s;wer. After a long farce of lying and intriguing on my
<PB N="194" REF="225">
part, and credulity on hers, I accompli&s;hed the grand end&mdash;you will gue&s;s what I mean.</P>
<P>We lived in love and rapture about a month, when her father bid her prepare to marry Mr. Lute&s;tring, the mercer, by the next week. She flew to the u&s;ual place of a&s;&s;ignation, bathed in tears, with a face expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t violent grief.</P>
<P>I was now almo&s;t per&s;uaded to love her in ear|ne&s;t; but I was a Sad Dog to &s;uffer revenge (and when I &s;eriou&s;ly reflect, a revenge which had no foundation in rea&s;on) to get the better of every nobler pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O! my dear Harry,"</Q> exclaimed the beautiful unfortunate, <Q REND="inline">"let us fly immediately to Scotland, otherwi&s;e my father, inhuman man! will oblige me to marry Bob Lute&s;tring next week."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bob Lute&s;tring, my dear,"</Q> replied I indif|ferently, <Q REND="inline">"is a &s;ub&s;tantial man, and I would not have you di&s;oblige your father on my account."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="226">
<Q REND="inline">"And is this your advice!"</Q> returned the he|roine, a&s;&s;uming a dignified air: <Q REND="inline">"be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, I &s;hall follow it."</Q> Saying this, &s;he &s;lung from me; her ideas, I &s;uppo&s;e, a little different from tho&s;e &s;he brought with her.</P>
<P>But I had not yet accompli&s;hed my revenge Steeled in impudence as I am, I blu&s;h to write the re&s;t; but it &s;hall be out. I informed Mr. Lute|&s;tring of my intimacy with his future &s;pou&s;e, and advi&s;ed him not to unite him&s;elf to a woman of &s;uch principles. I made certain of receiving a challenge, and a &s;tring of cur&s;es for my informa|tion; but, alas! I knew not the city. <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied the mercer, <Q REND="inline">"I thank you for your intel|ligence, this day received: but your advice is not worth a yard of tape; you &s;ay Sabina has been faulty; allow it: but will her father give me any thing the le&s;s for her fortune on that account? on the contrary, were not my notions of honour very refined, I might make it a means of rai&s;ing my price."</Q> I &s;lunk away, a&s;toni&s;hed at this reply, re|flecting how various are the &s;pecies and refine|ments of honour.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="227">
I was now ju&s;t on the brink of poverty: I had made a con&s;iderable breach in my la&s;t five hun|dred; and began to &s;hudder at the contempt with which the decay of my fortune threatened me. Relying on his former profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, I po&s;ted down to Sir Stentor Ranger, in hopes he would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me. I found the knight very bu&s;y, with Sir Charles Banbury, in tracing the honourable pedigree of an Arabian barb. <Q REND="inline">"Hey, Hal,"</Q> exclaimed the knight, with a voice which would have drowned the full chorus of a fox|chace; <Q REND="inline">"what the devil brought thee here? I thought thou wert grown a gentleman, and had forgotten us all."</Q> He received me with as much kindne&s;s and civility, as his ru&s;tic breeding would permit, and invited me to his antiquated hall.</P>
<P>After a noble dinner of veni&s;on, when Sir Charles had retired, on cracking the nineteenth bottle, I ventured to open the bu&s;ine&s;s. Nothing can expre&s;s the &s;urpri&s;e which di&s;tended the knight's ample countenance. I made no very agreeable comments on his a&s;toni&s;hment; but, thank Heaven! tho&s;e comments were as ground|le&s;s as the Rev. Mr. Bentinck's on the Bible.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="228">
<Q REND="inline">"Zounds,"</Q> thundered the knight, <Q REND="inline">"five thou|&s;and pounds gone already: you have been a Sad Dog, Hal, that I'll &s;ay for thee. But, how&s;un|dever, as thou bee&s;t my nown fle&s;h and blood, d'ye &s;ee, I'll do &s;omething for thee. Let me &s;ee, let me &s;ee: do&s;t under&s;tand hor&s;e-fle&s;h?"</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"that I was not very deep in the my&s;tery, but I hoped, with a little of his in&s;truc|tions, to be &s;erviceable to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Adad, thou art in the right, Hal, nobody knows the&s;e things better than me. There's my lord Gro&s;venor's filly, Long Dick; he would have it, that he was got by his own hor&s;e, Thunder, when I, by the mere make of his pa&s;tern, found 'um out, to be got by Sir George Blunt's white hor&s;e, Duke. Do&s;t know any thing of dogs? Can&s;t train a pointer, or a hawk, or &s;uch like things?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> I replied, <Q REND="inline">"I could with &s;afety un|dertake."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well then, zay no more; no more words to the matter: I'll do for thee; thou &s;halt have one hundred and fifty pounds a year, and &s;o ge'es
<PB N="198" REF="229">
thy hand, Hal. A bargain's a bargain; I &s;corn to flinch from my word: thou &s;halt ha'it, odzookers, thou &s;halt ha'it."</Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this bargain I commenced &s;u|perintendant of his &s;tables and kennels. I di&s;|charged my office much to his &s;atisfaction; and by dint of application acquiring &s;ome knowledge in the my&s;teries of the turf, I began to be of con&s;e|quence in the racing world. Sir Stentor's hall was very ancient, and had been in days of yore a family &s;eat of the Mowbrays. It had not under|gone any con&s;iderable reparation &s;ince the Refor|mation; when an ance&s;tor of Sir Stentor's, having often had quarrels with a neighbouring abbot, in the &s;acrilegious pillage, purcha&s;ed his abbey for le&s;s than the one-twentieth of its value; and rob|bing it of all its ornaments and painted gla&s;s, made the abbey a &s;table, and turned his dogs into the chapel.</P>
<P>Sir Stentor had many curious vi&s;itors, on account of his antient painted gla&s;s-windows; among the re&s;t was the redoubted baron Otranto, who has &s;pent his whole life in conjectures. This mo&s;t ingenious gentleman, as a certain adverti&s;er &s;tiles
<PB N="199" REF="230">
him, is certainly a good judge of paintings, and has an original, ea&s;y manner of writing. That his knowledge in antiquity equals his other ac|compli&s;hments may be di&s;puted. As Sir Stentor had ever been politically attached to his family, he welcomed the the baron with every demon&s;tration of joy, and ordered the bells of the pari&s;h church to be rung. As a further te&s;timony of his joy, he &s;ent for a blind fidler, the Barthelemon of the vil|lage, to entertain the baron with a &s;olo during din|ner; and after the de&s;ert, Robin Hood's Ramble was melodiou&s;ly chaunted by the knight's groom and dairy-maid, to the excellent mu&s;ic of a two|&s;tringed violin, and a bag-pipe. A concert by the fir&s;t ma&s;ters in Europe could not have plea&s;ed the baron &s;o well: he imagined him&s;elf carried back to the age of his favourite hero, Richard the Third.</P>
<P>Should any critic a&s;&s;ert, that it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch an imagination could enter the <HI>cerebellum</HI> of the baron, who confines all his ideas with|in the narrow limits of propriety (for the &s;ongs of Robin Hood were not in being till the reign of queen Elizabeth) his a&s;&s;ertion &s;hall &s;tand un|contradicted by me, as I know, by woeful expe|rience,
<PB N="200" REF="231">
that when an author re&s;olves to think him|&s;elf in the right, it is more than human argu|ment can do to convince him he is in the wrong.</P>
<P>The baron, after dinner, a&s;ked the knight if he had ever di&s;covered in any place about his hou&s;e an e&s;cutcheon argent, on a fe&s;&s;e gules; three garbs, or; between as many &s;hields, &s;able, cheveronny of the fir&s;t?</P>
<P>To this learned interrogatory the knight an&s;wer|ed with a &s;tare of a&s;toni&s;hment, and <Q REND="inline">"Anon, Sir, what d'ye talk of? I don't under&s;tand &s;uch out|landi&s;h lingo, not I, for my part."</Q></P>
<P>Otranto finding it impo&s;&s;ible to enter into a con|ver&s;ation &s;uitable to his hobby-hor&s;e, begged leave to vi&s;it the kennel, de&s;iring the knight to permit the hunt&s;man to go with him, le&s;t the dogs might not be over civil to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Odzookers,"</Q> cried Sir Stentor, <Q REND="inline">"are you afraid of the dogs? I'll go with you my&s;elf, man."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="232">
The baron found many things worthy his no|tice in the ruinated chapel; but the knight was &s;o full of the prai&s;es of his harriers, that the an|tiquary had not opportunity to form one conjec|ture. After looking round the chapel for &s;ome moveable piece of age, on which he might em|ploy his &s;peculative talents, to the eternal honour of his judgment, he pitched upon a &s;tone which had no antiquity at all; and, tran&s;ported with his fancied prize, placed it upon his head, and bore it triumphantly to his chamber, de&s;iring the knight to give him no di&s;turbance the next day, as he intended to devote it to the &s;ervice of futurity.</P>
<P>This important piece of &s;tone had by the hunt&s;|man been &s;acrilegiou&s;ly &s;tolen from the neighbour|ing church-yard, and employed with others to &s;top up a breach in the kennel, through which the ad|venturous Jowler had &s;queezed his lank carca&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing can e&s;cape the clutches of curio&s;ity. The letters being ill cut, had an appearance of &s;omething Gothic; and the baron was &s;o far gone in this Quixoti&s;m of literature, that at the fir&s;t glance he determined them to be of the third Ru|nic alphabet of Wormius.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="233">
The original in&s;cription was: James Hicks lieth here, with He&s;ter his wife.</P>
<P>The broken &s;tone is here represented, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The baron having turned over Camden, Dug|dale, Leyland, and Wever, at la&s;t determined it to be, <HI>Hic jacet corpus Kenelmae Sancto Legero. Re|quic&s;eat,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. What confirmed him in the above reading, and made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to be mi&s;taken, was, that a great man of the name of Sancto Legero, had been buried in the county about five hundred years ago.</P>
<P>Elated with the happy di&s;covery, the Baron had an elegant engraving of the curio&s;ity executed, and pre&s;ented it to the &s;ociety of antiquaries, who look upon it as one of the mo&s;t important di&s;coveries which have been made &s;ince the great Dr. Trefoil found out, that the word <HI>kine</HI> came from the Sax|on <HI>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="234">
When this miracle of literature left the village, the bells were again rung, and the baron was wrapped in Ely&s;ium on the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>I had &s;erved Sir Stentor above two years, when, by a lucky hit, Sir Charles Banbury and my&s;elf took the whole field in, and cleared above twenty thou&s;and pounds; eight thou&s;and of which fell to my &s;hare.</P>
<P>I was now once more e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, and redeemed from the dependance which had mortified my pride. As I was &s;eldom ungrateful, I repaid Sir Stentor's kindne&s;s, by revealing to him the whole <HI>arcana</HI> of the turf; which he has improved to &s;o much advantage, that he has added five hundred <HI>per annum</HI> to his paternal e&s;tate, by his &s;ucce&s;&s;es at Newmarket.</P>
<P>In pro&s;perity I never gave ear to the &s;age whi&s;|pers of Prudence; her cool advice was never felt, but in the winter of adver&s;ity. I was flu&s;h, and re&s;olved to go over to Paris, and glitter in all the &s;plendor of an Engli&s;hman. This rapid re&s;olution was as rapidly executed, and in le&s;s than ten days
<PB N="204" REF="235">
after my &s;ucce&s;s I found my&s;elf at the city of noi&s;e and frippery.</P>
<P>I had too much &s;pirit to murmur at the expence, but I often wi&s;hed for &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial, than <HI>&s;oup</HI> or <HI>frica&s;&eacute;e:</HI> after living at the gigantic table of Sir Stentor, and fea&s;ting on roa&s;t beef and veni&s;on, I found it difficult to &s;wallow liquids and &s;hadows. But every other con&s;ideration was &s;oon drowned in that of a young marchione&s;s, who never met my eyes without telling them &s;uch a tale of love, that it was impo&s;&s;ible not to under|&s;tand it.</P>
<P>I directed my valet La Fo&s;&s;e, to make every po&s;&s;ible enquiry after her: he brought me intelli|gence that &s;he was the widow of a marquis, and of a very noble family. This was &s;ufficient: I in&s;tantly di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger of love to her: and 'ere another moon had gilded up her horns, married her. But I had cau&s;e to repent my expe|dition; &s;he was indeed the widow of a marquis, but one of the poore&s;t of that title in France; his debts were great, and his widow in&s;tead of di&s;|charging them, had contracted more, her noble family not being able to &s;upport her.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="236">
I was &s;oon rouzed from my dream of happine&s;s, and thrown into pri&s;on; my fortune was in&s;uffi|cient to procure my liberty, and there I &s;hould have peri&s;hed, had not an old rich farmer-general taken my wife under his protection, paid her debts, generou&s;ly &s;et me free, and pre&s;ented me with a bill of two hundred pounds, on condition I returned to England. I did not chu&s;e to reject his offer, and with that &s;ort of p&s;eudo-repentance, which generally waits on us when we are grown wi&s;e too late, took my leave of France and pro|&s;perity.</P>
<P>Immediately on my return to England, I waited on Sir Stentor; but the knight knowing my ge|nius in hor&s;e-fle&s;h, was not willing to put me in a condition of rivalling him upon the turf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Zounds, Hal, whoy thou &s;pende&s;t every thing: no, no, I duont want a top game-keeper now. Here, I'll gi' thee this bill of one hundred pounds, and my bay gelding Jockey: go and &s;ee 'un, he is as fine a bea&s;t as any I have in hand."</Q></P>
<P>I thought it not prudent to refu&s;e the knight's offer; and making the be&s;t of a bad bargain, ac|cepted
<PB N="206" REF="237">
Jockey, and the bill, and made the be&s;t of my way to London.</P>
<P>Here, after a long deliberation, I re&s;olved to turn &s;tock-jobber: and the fir&s;t time I vi&s;ited Jona|than's, by propagating a report that Jamaica was taken by the Spaniards, increa&s;ed my &s;mall &s;um to two thou&s;and pounds. I was now in raptures, and &s;aw once again the vi&s;ions of good fortune &s;wimming before my &s;ight. I &s;till continued im|proving my principal, when an account from Trie&s;te reduced me to &s;even hundred; and in a few days after, another account from the &s;ame un|fortunate place, utterly ruined me, and I wad|dled a lame duck out of the alley.</P>
<P>What could I now do? As to mechanic bu&s;i|ne&s;s I was utterly a &s;tranger to it, and my &s;oul di&s;|dained the livery of a &s;lave. I had di&s;tracted my|&s;elf with reflection, till the la&s;t bill of ten pounds was mutilated, when I thought of &s;etting up for an author.</P>
<P>As I did not doubt my invention, and had va|nity enough for the character, I &s;at down to in|voke the mu&s;es. The fir&s;t fruits of my pen, were
<PB N="107" REF="238">
a political e&s;&s;ay and a piece of poetry: the fir&s;t I carried to a patriotic book&s;eller, who is, in his own opinion, of much con&s;equence to the cau&s;e of liberty; and the poetry was left with another of the &s;ame tribe, who made bold to make it a means of puffing his Magazine, but refu&s;ed any gratuity. Mr. Britannicus, at fir&s;t imagining the piece was not to be paid for, was lavi&s;h of his prai&s;es, and I might depend upon it, it &s;hould do honour to his flaming patriotic paper; but when he was told that I expected &s;ome recompence, he a&s;&s;umed an air of critici&s;m, and begged my par|don; he did not know that circum&s;tance, and real|ly he did not think it good language, or &s;ound rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I was not di&s;couraged by the objections and critici&s;ms of the book&s;elling tribe; and as I know the art of Curli&s;m, pretty well, I make a tolerable hand of it. But, Mr. Printer, the late pro&s;ecution again&s;t the book&s;ellers having frightened them all out of their patrioti&s;m, I am nece&s;&s;itated either to write for the entertainment of the public, or in defence of the mini&s;try. As I have &s;ome little remains of con&s;cience, the latter is not very agreeable. Political writing, of either
<PB N="208" REF="239">
&s;ide of the que&s;tion, is of little &s;ervice to the enter|tainment or in&s;truction of the reader. Abu&s;e and &s;currillity are generally the chief figures in the language of party. I am not of the opinion of tho&s;e authors, who deem every man in place a ra&s;cal, and every man out of place a patriot.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LEST your Hunter of Oddities &s;hould meet with me, and cook up my &s;ingularity as a di&s;h of diver&s;ion for the town, I trouble you with a de&s;cription of my&s;elf. Have you ever &s;een a portait by Holbein, or the figure of an old fellow in ancient tape&s;try? I am a laughable counter|part to either of the&s;e curio&s;ities. I am heir to no incon&s;iderable e&s;tate, which has but one incum|brance on it; a plaguy, long-lived, &s;urly dog of a father.</P>
<P>If I am not mi&s;taken the Roman-catholics make longevity one of the peculiar gifts of heaven. I confe&s;s I am &s;o irreligious as to wi&s;h heaven had been le&s;s &s;paring of its gifts to my honoured papa. You will &s;ay I am an ungracious child, perhaps; but when you have got to the end of my epi&s;tle, you will excu&s;e me. If ab&s;urdities and follies are the general attendants of age, I cannot &s;ee with what ju&s;tice grey-hairs command veneration.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="241">
My father has as well furni&s;hed a wardrobe as any knight in the &s;hire; but not an individual garment in it which has been made &s;ince the Re|volution.</P>
<P>My father dre&s;&s;es in the uniform of a courtier in the reign of James I. his hat is like a &s;trawberry|ba&s;ket, with the handle thru&s;t under his chin: this piece of ornament belonged to Robert Carey, who, as he was a great man in his time, and nearly related to our family, mu&s;t not be out of remembrance. He wears al&s;o an enormous ruff, once the property of Sir Veni&s;on Goo&s;epye, lord|mayor of London, who, though of a younger branch of the family, e&s;tabli&s;hed it on a more re|&s;pectable footing than before, by doubling its rent|roll. Gratitude obliges my &s;ire to wear this ruff, though as full of holes as a lawyer's con&s;cience. A fla&s;hed doublet, with &s;lit &s;leeves, and a long cloak, envelopes his trunk; and a mon&s;trous pair of trunk-ho&s;e, &s;quare &s;hoes, and large &s;hoe-ro&s;es, conclude his bundle of ridiculous habiliments. Could I per&s;uade him to be contented with mak|ing him&s;elf laughed at, I &s;hould be happy in en|tertaining my friends with the oddity of his ap|pearance; but when I con&s;ider that mine is equally
<PB N="211" REF="242">
as laughable, I &s;icken at the &s;ight of his antiquated garb. I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to de&s;cribe my&s;elf; but in hopes that he mu&s;t &s;oon &s;et out on his jour|ney to the other world, I make a virtue of nece&s;|&s;ity, and comply. He ab&s;olutely threatens to di&s;in|herit me, if I grumble at dre&s;&s;ing for the memory of the departed; and an e&s;tate of &s;ix-thou&s;and <HI>per annum,</HI> is not to be lo&s;t for the &s;ake of a full|trimmed &s;uit, and a gold button. My hair is dre&s;&s;ed in a very peculiar and ri&s;ible manner; it is cut clo&s;e on the middle of the head, and twi&s;ted like a hor&s;e's mane on each &s;ide: this my papa avers was the mo&s;t polite fa&s;hion in the reign of queen Elizabeth, as appears by the portrait of his great uncle, Sir Henry Dainty. This Sir Henry was the greate&s;t beau of his time, and is thought by a learned antiquary to be the identical per&s;on for whom Shake&s;peare drew the character of O&s;t|rick in Hamlet. My hat is not quite &s;o comical as my &s;ire's; it inclines more to the &s;hape of a clo&s;e|&s;tool-pan, pardon the &s;imile, you will find it in another author, it is too delicate to be my own. This ornament of the head once graced the <HI>caput</HI> of the profound Dr. Technicus, who had an uni|ver&s;al no&s;trum which enabled him to ride in his chair; and what do you think this no&s;trum was?
<PB N="212" REF="243">
Nothing but a catapla&s;m of ma&s;ticated bread and butter. My ruff is perfectly yellow: but as it be|longed to the reverend Dr. Drouzy, my father makes it a point of con&s;cience to oblige me to wear it.

<P>This, Mr. Printer, is a perfect repre&s;entation of my externals. Do be &s;o obliging as to give the old fellow a hint in your Magazine, that he acts very ridiculou&s;ly. He has already felt the bad effects of his antiquated wardrobe. My &s;i&s;ter was as laughable as my&s;elf; &s;he wore a hood of un|con&s;cionable thick velvet, which projected on each &s;ide of her face, like a hor&s;e's blinds; her ruff was enormous, and betwixt that and her head-gear there was nothing but the tip of her no&s;e to be &s;een: her &s;tays reached down to her knees, her &s;tockings were yellow, and her &s;hoes &s;quare-toed. All the&s;e ornaments had in the days of their pro|&s;perity, glittered on Alice Sevenoke, a maid of honour to queen Mary, who was famous for making cu&s;tards, and giving eel-pies an excellent reli&s;h. My &s;i&s;ter Biddy's gown was as heavy as

a modern novel: upon a moderate computation it had above three pounds of &s;ilver, in its embroidery: the colours indeed were faded, but that defect was made up in the lenghth of the train, which afforded the cat a five minutes play while Mi&s;s Biddy was turning the corner.</P>
<P>A female mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be wor&s;e qualified to bear this purgatory than a man; and &s;he having fifteen thou&s;and pounds, which an old aunt had left her to be paid at her marriage, whipped off to Scotland, at the age of &s;ixteen, with a young fellow in the army. Would I could make my e&s;cape too, from the tyranny of this taylor of an|tiquity! I am &s;en&s;ible no character at Cornelys's could make &s;o ridiculous an appearance as I do.</P>
<P>Oh, dear Mr. Ham, if you have any bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, addre&s;s a line or two to the old prig: &s;hew him how barbarous it is to deprive a young fellow of all the plea&s;ures of life, to in|dulge an unaccountable whim: pu&s;h the matter home to him; and, if you &s;ucceed, you &s;hall ever have the prayers of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think Addi&s;on &s;ays, in defining a complete fine gentleman, that even dre&s;s &s;hould be at|tended to; and, indeed, it has &s;o great an influ|ence in mo&s;t &s;ituations of this life, that a per&s;on who is entirely negligent of it will find him&s;elf either overlooked or de&s;pi&s;ed in the u&s;ual inter|cour&s;e of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, &s;ome &s;ingular characters, who pique them&s;elves upon an utter contempt for dre&s;s; but to the &s;hame of men of letters be it &s;aid, that the&s;e are generally pedants, or &s;uch as value them&s;elves upon an affected ab&s;ence from the trivial pur&s;uits of this world.</P>
<P>Dick Flighty, is a man of a very different ca&s;t from the&s;e: dre&s;s he con&s;iders as the ultimate end of exi&s;tence; and he would be mi&s;erable for a
<PB N="215" REF="246">
year if lord M&mdash;, or captain G&mdash;, was to have a new fa&s;honed <HI>cut,</HI> from Paris before him. He was the fir&s;t who introduced the Tambour wai&s;tcoat: he rode po&s;t from that metropolis, with &s;ix hor&s;es, to be here in time. This he con|&s;idered as a very capital &s;troke in e&s;tabli&s;hing his fa&s;hionable character; and which he looked upon as indi&s;pen&s;able, when Sir James G&mdash; appeared in a &s;ilver &s;ilk flowered embroidery, before he had recieved intelligence of the invention. His di&s;|grace upon this occa&s;ion was inexpre&s;&s;ible; and had he not retrieved him&s;elf in the violet birds eye velvet, on the en&s;uing birth-day, the con&s;equence might have been fatal.</P>
<P>Dick is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of about four thou&s;and a year, which he lays out, in his opinion, to the be&s;t ad|vantage. He neither games nor drinks, which con&s;idering the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the age, is &s;ome|thing extraordinary: but then he keeps as elegant an equipage as any man in town, which he con|&s;tantly u&s;es: be&s;ides this, he has a fine pack of hounds, though he never hunts, four race-hor&s;es, though he never &s;ports; and keeps three mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, whom he never vi&s;its.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="247">
To be ingenuous, Dick may be fairly cla&s;&s;ed as the &s;overeign of <HI>petit maitres,</HI> the prince of fops, and the repre&s;entative-general of coxcombs: never|thele&s;s, Dick, is an arrant &s;loven. Whil&s;t he is driving from one end of the town to the other, in &s;earch of the mo&s;t celebrated embroiderer, to give him directions concerning a new invented &s;prig, his <HI>chapeau de bras,</HI> which he wears on his head, would be a di&s;grace to a hair dre&s;&s;er; and the back of his coat is more grea&s;y than a but|cher's; but then this is the <HI>ton.</HI> Dick holds it as an invariable maxim, that a clean coat and a good hat, in an undre&s;s, would be a di&s;grace to a gen|tleman, and bring him upon a level with a <HI>bour|geois.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FINDING you gave place to my Odd Man in your la&s;t, I have &s;ent you another to hand up in the group; and as I &s;hall let you have one every month, we &s;hall by the end of the year complete our collection.</P>
<P>Dick Slender is now about his forty-fifth year, &s;ix feet high, without any incumbrance of fle&s;h. He is one of tho&s;e people who &s;aunter about town and call them&s;elves gentlemen, becau&s;e they have nothing to do, and are incapable of doing any thing.</P>
<P>Dick, upon the death of his father, became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of three thou&s;and pounds in the funds; he was de&s;tined to the bar, and had been brought up in the Temple; but finding in him&s;elf very lit|tle di&s;po&s;ition for the Statutes at Large, or Coke upon Littleton, he &s;hut up his folios, and re&s;olved to be the man of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="249">
He &s;oon di&s;covered, however, that the intere&s;t of his money, at three per cent. would not &s;up|port him in the line of life he had chalked out; and, therefore, &s;unk the capital in the purcha&s;e of an annuity, and caring for neither man, woman, or child, eats, drinks, and dre&s;&s;es up to one hundred and eighty pounds per annum.</P>
<P>Dick is always the fir&s;t night at a new play in the pit; and though he never read Ari&s;totle, or under&s;tands a &s;yllable of Horace, he is one of the greate&s;t critics of the age. He has learnt a few &s;et-phra&s;es at the Bedford: the&s;e he utters promi&s;|cuou&s;ly upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions, and he blends them in &s;o curious a manner that they will do for any performance of every degree of merit. He, neverthele&s;s, has, frequently, a crowd about him at the coffee-hou&s;e; and his deci&s;ions, indeci&s;ive as they be, are con&s;idered as the opinion of the town.</P>
<P>His &s;ucce&s;s in gallantry is not le&s;s con&s;picuous than his judgment in critici&s;m; if a number of letters con&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed to him in a female, hand, often &s;ealed with a coronet, can authenticate his intrigues, or prove that half the women of
<PB N="219" REF="250">
fa&s;hion in England are enamoured with him. But unfortunately he lately quarrelled with his wa&s;her|woman upon the lo&s;s of &s;ome &s;ilk &s;tockings, and &s;he has revealed a &s;ecret that has bani&s;hed him from George's for the&s;e three weeks. She was the amanuen&s;is, the corre&s;ponding ladies, and the deliverer of all the&s;e letters to the parties who brought them to this coffee-hou&s;e; and &s;he is re|&s;olved to keep the &s;eal, with the coronet, for her trouble. This &s;he has revealed to &s;everal of her cu&s;tomers in the Temple, at the &s;ame time de|claring, that notwith&s;tanding the many intrigues &s;he had carried on with Dick Slender, and though &s;he had often been alone with him in private, he had never once offered a rude thing to her: yet Jenny is but two and twenty, has a very wanton eye, and a good complexion.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate Dick's character &s;till farther, he is a politician; he has read all Junius's letters, and can make out every da&s;h; he is a member of the Bill of Rights: harangues at the Smyrna upon the Middle&s;ex election; and propo&s;es que&s;tions at the Robin-hood upon the legality of incapacitation. It is true, that all his political reading has been confined to the Public and the Gazetteer; but no
<PB N="220" REF="251">
man under&s;tands the real <HI>nature of our con&s;titution; the e&s;&s;ence of our rights and liberties; the limits of the prerogative; the extent of parliamentary privi|leges; the nature of our foreign connections, or the balance of power,</HI> better, or more profoundly, than DICK SLENDER&mdash;by <HI>intuition!</HI></P>

<P>THIS metropolis abounds with &s;o many oddi|ties, that I am &s;ometimes at a lo&s;s to hit upon one for the month. I have now in my col|lection about three dozen, that will do either for winter or &s;ummer: their peculiarities are of &s;uch a nature, and they are &s;uch complete originals, they never can be un&s;ea&s;onably hung up to public view. But a truce with preface, or el&s;e, perhaps, you will think me worthy a place in my own col|lection.</P>
<P>Eolus is as variable in his temper as the thirty|two points of the compa&s;s; but it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged that a coach has to him all the mag|netic qualities of the load-&s;tone, e&s;pecially when the wind is in his chops. But why confine his cha|racter in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s? Eolus is every body, and every thing at times: he eats like Quin, drinks with Rigby, intrigues with a Cumb&mdash;d, and fights with every man that never exi&s;ted. He is a buck|ram hero, and, if I might be allowed a taylor's

<P>Here, cook&mdash;at four preci&s;ely&mdash;let the veni&s;on be done to a turn; and as to the turbot, let it weigh exactly three pounds, not an ounce more or le&s;s.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eolus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Jack, I mu&s;t acknowledge you do make me eat a pound more &s;ince you came to the hou&s;e, than ever I did before. I &s;hall ju&s;t take a turn in a hack round the new buildings, Gro&s;venor|&s;quare, and Marybone, by way of a whet, and be here preci&s;ely at four.</P>
</SP>
<P>So &s;hort a dialogue, dear Ham, cannot certainly di&s;gu&s;t your readers; but, perhaps, they may be curious to know how many he has to dine with
<PB N="223" REF="254">
him? Ju&s;t as many as a certain r&mdash;l lover found, when he awoke and met with nobody but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Eolus &s;eems to have followed Quin's rule, which I &s;hall exemplify. Said lady T&mdash;&s;h&mdash;d (I mean the mode&s;t lady T&mdash;&s;h&mdash;d) to Quin: <Q REND="inline">"I won|der, Mr. Quin, that you do not marry, take a hou&s;e, and keep an equipage."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why lookye, my lady, I like the &s;weets of matrimony without the bitters&mdash;I always carry my wife, my coach, and my cook in my pocket, and when they di&s;plea&s;e me, jolt me into a pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;poil my appetite, I turn them off."</Q></P>
<P>Quin was &s;o pregnant of good things, that the very mention of him, engenders a number; but I &s;hall take up your reader's time with the relation of only one more, which he &s;aid to the &s;ame lady, upon a &s;omewhat &s;imilar occa&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mr. Quin,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"did you ever make love?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, my lady,"</Q> replied Sir John Bruce, <Q REND="inline">"I al|ways buy it ready made."</Q></P>
<P>So much for Quin; now once more for Eolus: he is about five &s;eet nothing; as round as a hog|&s;head, owing to his eating immoderately; rides in a hack all the morning to create an appetite; rides
<PB N="224" REF="255">
in the &s;ame vehicle all the afternoon to promote dige&s;tion. He has &s;even hundred a year, of which he does not &s;ave a farthing, which he di&s;po&s;es of chiefly to hackney-coachmen and vintners. The ladies, however, ingro&s;s &s;ome part of his pur&s;e, as well as his per&s;on; but he is an oeconomi&s;t in love, at lea&s;t with regard to property, which he transfers to them very &s;paringly.</P>
<P>If after this any one &s;hould think Eolus the mere puff of imagination, he may be &s;een alive eve|ry day at four, not a hundred yards from War|wick-court, Holborn.</P>

<P>LOUNGING the other day at Slaughter's cof|fee-hou&s;e, I made acquaintance with a per|&s;on, who has turned out a proper candidate to be enrolled in your li&s;t of oddities.</P>
<P>He had been reading the Gazetteer for about twenty minutes, in the cour&s;e of which he had taken as many pinches of &s;nuff, when he &s;tarted all at once, and giving a fling to the paper, over|turned a di&s;h of &s;calding coffee upon a gentleman's white &s;ilk &s;tockings, crying, <Q REND="inline">"Zounds, there he is again&mdash;how he &s;tinks!"</Q> then ri&s;ing up without paying any attention to the mi&s;chief he had done, or making the lea&s;t apology to the gentleman who&s;e legs he had &s;calded, he walked three or four times up and down the room &s;haking his arm and fingers, crying out, <Q REND="inline">"Keep off, keep off."</Q></P>
<P>I did not know what to conclude from his beha|viour; but as I was the neare&s;t to him during his exclamation, and this perambulation, I thought it
<PB N="226" REF="257">
nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k him whether he propo&s;ed in&s;ulting me&mdash;to which he made no reply, but muttered <Q REND="inline">"The devil opened my curtains la&s;t night, and he has been after me all day."</Q> Then &s;haking his hand more violently than ever, <Q REND="inline">"there you are off at la&s;t."</Q> After this curious &s;oliloquy, he began to grow a little calm, &s;eated him&s;elf upon another of the benches, and ordered a pint of milk. He then pulled out of his pocket &s;everal old pamph|lets, and read them very attentively, but not with|out ejaculating now and thee, <Q REND="inline">"Off, you villain, off,"</Q> and &s;haking his hand and arm very violently.</P>
<P>I enquired at the bar, who this extraordinary per&s;on was, and whether he was out of his mind; when I was informed, that he was Mr. Ha&mdash;w&mdash;y, brother to the commi&s;&s;ioner of that name; that he had frequented the hou&s;e &s;everal years, and that he was a very inoffen&s;ive, good-natured man.</P>
<P>Having received this intelligence, I re&s;olved to have a little conver&s;ation with him, when I found him very rational upon every &s;ubject, except the devil: but the &s;lighte&s;t hint about that infernal being, made him &s;hake his hand and arm, and cry out, <Q REND="inline">"Off&mdash;off."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="258">
It would be doing this gentleman a great piece of &s;ervice, if any of your ingenious corre&s;pondents could hit upon &s;ome probable &s;cheme of exorci|&s;ing this &s;ame devil out of poor Ha&mdash;w&mdash;y, who would then in every re&s;pect be an agreeable and worthy member of &s;ociety.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have much rea&s;on to think my|&s;elf qualified for &s;ociety, I am, to my great mortification, confided in a boarding-&s;chool; how|ever, I am not debarred the plea&s;ure of reading. I know all the real names of your <HI>t&eacute;te &agrave; t&eacute;tes;</HI> and am very well &s;killed in decyphering an a&s;teri&s;m or da&s;h. I have peru&s;ed every novel publi&s;hed by Lowndes or Noble; and could, upon occa&s;ion, compile a &s;ecret hi&s;tory, as pathetic and moving as any other female author. There is no modern play which I have not read; from the bright &s;al|lies of Foote, to the dull dialogue of Cumberland. You &s;ee I am a judge of theatrical merit: my knowledge of the drama, is hereditary; for my cou&s;in Ben, who under&s;tands heraldry, can prove him&s;elf (and con&s;equently me) to be de&s;cended from Ben Jon&s;on's grandmother's &s;i&s;ter. So much for internal merit. The young fox-hunters in the neighbourhood &s;wear I am a woundy pretty maid! The politer &s;ort prote&s;t before gad, I am
<PB N="229" REF="260">
an angel; and Madame Gouvernante, tells me, I am very fair, very elegant, and every way ac|compli&s;hed. You will excu&s;e this de&s;cription of my&s;elf, as it is a true, though trite ob&s;ervation, that few readers regard any hi&s;tory 'till they are minutely acquainted with the author: my inten|tion in writing, was to a&s;k your advice. Now you mu&s;t know Mr. Ham, that I have ten thou|&s;and pounds, at my own di&s;po&s;al; a qualification, which may, in your opinion, exceed all the others I value my&s;elf upon. My father, who is a plod|ding &s;ort of a man, and upon Bri&s;tol exchange, (or rather in the &s;treet) has the character of a rich merchant, who knows how to live in the world, de&s;igns to marry me to Bob Barter, the hopeful &s;on of his good friend Hezekiah Barter. Bob is, in the polite language of Bri&s;tol, a devil of a buck. You may &s;ee him in the morning, &s;itting under a &s;hed on the key, regi&s;tering the weight of &s;ugars, and in the evening &s;hining at a ball. He overturns a ba&s;ket of oy&s;ters, or beats a dog, with a better grace than any youthful notary of Bacchus, in that elegant city: the cream of po|litene&s;s. As Madame Gouvernante knows my father's intentions, &s;he very readily permits his intru&s;ions, and takes every opportunity to leave
<PB N="230" REF="261">
us together. The wretch has never read further than the Gazette, or tables of intere&s;t; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to receive a compliment worth accept|ing from him. He &s;eems to look upon me as already married, and treats me with a &s;uitable indifference. Upon the exit of the Gouvernante, he claps on his hat, takes a turn round the room, very politely expo&s;es his back&s;ide to the fire, and remarks it is very cold, or &s;omething of equal importance. I never regard the wretch; but if I am reading, con&s;ider my&s;elf as alone, and read on. Pray, Mr. Hamilton, is &s;uch a contemptible be|ing, to be treated with more re&s;pect? Having told you, I do not like this uncivilized Bri&s;tolian, you may imagine a <HI>tendre&s;&s;e</HI> for &s;ome other has made his faults more con&s;picuous. You will not be far from the truth. A young author who has read more than, Magliabechi, and wrote more love-letters than Ovid, is continually in|voking the nine to de&s;cribe me; but he never pays a compliment to my per&s;on, without a con|comitant one to my under&s;tanding. Though I have ten thou&s;and pounds, he never mentions mar|riage; and when it is forced into his di&s;cour&s;e, rails at it mo&s;t religiou&s;ly: but he intrigues like a Je&s;uit, to be made happy with a <HI>t&eacute;te &agrave; t&eacute;te</HI> conver|&s;ation,
<PB N="231" REF="262">
or a walk in the wood; but, thank my &s;tars! I have always courageou&s;ly denied. He has &s;entiment in his common conver&s;ation; and is reported to have ruined three young ladies of for|tune. Pray, Mr. Hamilton, what am I to do in this ca&s;e? Nothing can be more di&s;agreeable than this boarding-&s;chool: If I am obliged to marry that in&s;ignificant wretch, Bob Barter, will the forced ceremony oblige me to hate my literary lover?

<P>I Was &s;ome time &s;ince in company with a party who piqued them&s;elves upon being men of wit and genius: one of them, however was no|thing more than a pretender, who after many inef|fectual attempts, at length &s;et the table on a roar, by a mo&s;t execrable pun; he joined in the laugh, and fancied he had now been very &s;ucce&s;sful, when a gentleman turning to lord Ch&mdash;d, a&s;ked his lord&s;hip what was his opinion of punning in gene|ral? To which his lord&s;hip replied, <Q REND="inline">"I conceive punning has a doublefold advantage in company, for a very good pun makes one laugh, and a very bad one makes one laugh &s;till more, as was the ca&s;e ju&s;t now; but,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"an indifferent pun, is the mo&s;t indifferent of all indifferent things; having neither &s;alt enough to make one &s;mile, or &s;tupidity enough to excite the ri&s;ible mu&s;cles at the author; and may therefore be &s;tiled the dregs of wit, the &s;ediment of humour, and the <HI>caput mortuum</HI> of common &s;en&s;e."</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE UNFORTUNATE FATHERS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Sladon, a merchant of Bri&s;tol, by in|du&s;try and diligent application to bu&s;ine&s;s, acquired a con&s;iderable fortune. As he was an enemy to noi&s;e and pomp, he neither &s;et up his carriage, nor endeavoured to make a &s;plended ap|pearance; his only care centered in Maria, his beautiful daughter: he &s;pared no co&s;ts to complete her education; her genius requited his labour; no in&s;tructions were lo&s;t on her, and &s;he excelled in every qualification, which dignify her &s;ex. At the age of &s;eventeen &s;he was univer&s;ally allowed to be a beauty. The reader will excu&s;e the writer from giving a de&s;cription of her per&s;on; let him cull from the volumes of poets and painters, all his imagination counts beautiful, and throw into it an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;oftne&s;s, and he has Maria.</P>
<P>Mr. Hinckley, who&s;e father was clo&s;ely con|nected in trade with Mr. Sladon, &s;truck with the
<PB N="236" REF="267">
uncommon lu&s;tre of Maria's per&s;on and mind, intreated his father, to permit him to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her. <Q REND="inline">"George,"</Q> &s;aid the prie&s;t of Mammon, <Q REND="inline">"I commend your choice, Mi&s;s Sladon is a very good oeconomi&s;t, and will have little le&s;s than a plumb to her fortune: go, and pro&s;per."</Q> Young Hinckley a&s;&s;ured his father he had not the lea&s;t mercenary view. <Q REND="inline">"Away,"</Q> replied the old man <Q REND="inline">"when you have been as often upon 'Change as me, you'll know better."</Q></P>
<P>Young Hinckley had no cau&s;e to complain of his reception; Maria had never viewed him with eyes of indifference. Mr. Sladon rejoiced at the pro|po&s;ed alliance; all was unity and love, and before the expiration of two months, George acquainted his father, that he intended to reque&s;t Mr. Sladon to fix the day; but was thunder&s;truck with his command, that he &s;hould not go &s;uch lengths till he had further orders from him.</P>
<P>Mr. Sladon, who was him&s;elf above deceit, ne|ver &s;u&s;pected it in another; his generous frankne&s;s laid him open to the vile arts of old Hinckley: after being connected together, the &s;pace of a year, he broke, and ruined him.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="268">
Maria had by this time conceived the mo&s;t ten|der pa&s;&s;ion for young Hinckley: it was allowable, as &s;he had always con&s;idered him as her future hu&s;band. No words can de&s;cribe Hinckley's ex|ce&s;s of love. Imagine what an effect this &s;troke mu&s;t have upon both. Nothing but imagination can paint it.</P>
<P>Mr. Sladon was only affected for his daughter: his noble &s;oul ro&s;e &s;uperior to this revolution; he triumphed in poverty, over the wealthy wretch who cau&s;ed his misfortunes. Old Hinckley, who&s;e fortune was increa&s;ed, not dimi&s;hed by this infa|mous action, perceived with chagrin, his &s;on's madne&s;s for Maria; he endeavoured to divert his attention to objects more rich, and therefore, in his opinion, more de&s;erving: but he laboured in vain; nothing could abate his love. Mr. Sladon &s;aw his pa&s;&s;ion; he pitied him: but could not think of uniting his daughter to a man, who&s;e &s;uperiority of circum&s;tances, was derived from his own ruin.</P>
<P>Old Hinckley, finding all remon&s;trances u&s;ele&s;s, by &s;ome mercenary agents, per&s;uaded Mr. Sladon that young Hinckley was privy to, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in his ruin. The circum&s;tances made it plau&s;ible;
<PB N="238" REF="269">
he believed it, and forbade him his hou&s;e. Maria would have credited it of any other man; in this ca&s;e it was dubious: her love for him was partial; but as &s;he had looked upon the father formerly in the be&s;t light, &s;he doubted whether &s;he might not be deceived in the &s;on. She was in this wavering opinion, when the only &s;ervant Mr. Sladon had, brought her a letter from young Hinckley: &s;he knew the hand, &s;he eagerly caught it; &s;he recol|lected, and dropped it on the ground: after a long &s;truggle between duty and love, &s;he &s;ent it back unopened. When a per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e and &s;trong natural parts, has not the happine&s;s of a religious education, he is generally a Dei&s;t or Soci|nian. This was the ca&s;e with young Hinckley; his father endeavouring to qualify him for com|merce, neglected Chri&s;tianity: to the mo&s;t refined notions of honour and morality, he united an ab|&s;olute contempt for religion; his pa&s;&s;ions were violent, but as he was continually on his guard, they &s;eldom appeared. When he heard that Ma|ria had returned his letter, he raved to the utmo&s;t extravagance of madne&s;s; then appearing calm, he &s;at down, and writing a letter, &s;ealed it and left it on the table. Having done this, he went into his chamber, and immediately &s;hot him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="270">
Old Hinckley hearing the explo&s;ion, ran from his compter, and a&s;cending the &s;tairs, &s;aw his &s;on extended breathle&s;s. He fainted, and continued in that condition, till his &s;ervants, occa&s;ionally co|ming in, recovered him.</P>
<P>The letter, which was directed to his father, contained what follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I &s;hall not accu&s;e your conduct, for you are my father; I &s;hall only endeavour to vindicate the action I am about to perpetrate. This will be ea&s;ily done. There is a principle in man (a &s;hadow of the Divinity) which con&s;titutes him the image of God; you may call it con&s;cience, grace, in&s;piration, the &s;pirit, or whatever name your education gives it. If a man acts according to this regulator, he is right: if contrary to it, he is wrong. It is an approved truth, that this prin|ciple varies in every rational being. As I can re|concile &s;uicide to this principle, with me it is con|&s;equently no crime. Suicide is &s;ometimes a noble in&s;anity of the &s;oul: and often the re&s;ult of a ma|ture and deliberate approbation of the &s;oul. If ever a crime it is only &s;o to &s;ociety; there indeed it always appears an irrational emotion: but when
<PB N="240" REF="271">
our being becomes di&s;&s;ocial, when we neither a&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t, or are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ociety, we do not injure it by laying down our load of life. It may &s;eem a paradoxical a&s;&s;ertion, that we cannot do wrong to our&s;elves; but it is certain we have power over our own exi&s;tence. Such is my opinion, and I have made u&s;e of &s;uch power.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This &s;eeming philo&s;ophy was lo&s;t on old Hinck|ley; he was really affected with the lo&s;s of his &s;on, and did not &s;urvive him three months.</P>
<P>Maria! the beautious Maria, had a &s;till &s;horter date. She heard the fatal news; and expired within a week.&mdash;Mr. Sladon loved his daughter too well to live without her; he compleated the tragedy, and &s;unk to the grave, re&s;igned and con|tented amid&s;t the cha&s;ti&s;ements of Providence.</P>
