<P>WE removed to Mrs. Hindon's ye&s;|terday, who received us with a profu&s;ion of civilities. They had company all the day; but my &s;pirits were weak, and I &s;upported no part in the conver&s;ation. Mrs. Hindon, however, would not allow me to indulge my contemplative hu|mour in peace, but enquired repeatedly what made me look &s;o grave, and if I found my&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed, till I was obliged to plead a head ach in excu&s;e for being &s;o dull a companion. This happened really to be the ca&s;e; and no &s;ooner was &s;he informed of it, than in &s;pite of all
<PB N="2" REF="3">
my re&s;i&s;tance &s;he fairly forced me to go to re&s;t at a very early hour, long before any of her gue&s;ts thought of taking leave. To this piece of kindne&s;s, though rather officious (for poor Mrs. Hindon's civilities are unfortunately &s;ometimes ra|ther obtru&s;ive) I was not &s;orry to con|&s;ent; and retiring to bed, though not to &s;leep, I pa&s;&s;ed the hours more at ea&s;e than I could have done in the mid&s;t of a large circle where I was con&s;trained to a&s;&s;ume an appearance of gaiety foreign to my feelings. Lady Farnford was of the party la&s;t night; and to-morrow evening we propo&s;e accompanying her Lady&s;hip to Drury-lane Theatre. She has a weekly box, to which we have re|ceived a general invitation whenever we incline to go.</P>
<P>Fanny, who as yet has not been pre|&s;ent at an entertainment of this kind, is half wild with eagerne&s;s and expectation; and for my&s;elf, never having &s;een a dra|matic

performance &s;ince that gay and happy period when I accompanied my deare&s;t Sophia and her worthy aunt to &s;everal of the different diver&s;ions at M&mdash;, the idea of my beloved friend is &s;o inti|mately connected with the thoughts of an amu&s;ement of this kind that I &s;igh at the melancholy reflection how di&s;tant we are at pre&s;ent, and recollect with redou|bled angui&s;h how delightful were the &s;en|&s;ations of that plea&s;ing aera of my life to tho&s;e which have &s;ucceeded.</P>

<P>Well, my dear Sophia, we were both much delighted at the play; although there was &s;omewhat very gloomy in a reflection which could not but occur on fir&s;t entering, that in &s;o large an audi|ence, where half the world &s;eemed met together, not one friendly countenance
<PB N="4" REF="5">
was to be found on which we had ever looked before, Lady Farnford and her daughter excepted (for Mr. Howard as well as Mrs. Hindon, were engaged to a lady's a&s;&s;embly, and Mr. Hindon &s;eldom goes to places of public amu&s;ement.) There is &s;omething extremely di&s;mal in the thoughts of being an unconnected and &s;olitary being, about whom no one is either &s;olicitous or intere&s;ted; nor does the idea ever &s;trike more poignantly than when you behold all around you in the full enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of friend|&s;hip and &s;ociety. Mi&s;s Farnford, in particular, appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s, if not friends, &s;uch variety of intimate ac|quaintances, that I could not avoid en|vying her in my heart the many kind &s;alutations &s;he gave and returned from different parts of the hou&s;e. This was however but a pa&s;&s;ing idea; for mo&s;t fortunately in the mid&s;t of the mu&s;ing to which it gave birth, and which in &s;pite
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of the novelty of the &s;urrounding &s;cene almo&s;t wholly engro&s;&s;ed me, I was &s;ud|denly rou&s;ed from my melancholy con|templations by the &s;ight of Mr. Roat&s;ley, who had entered the next box, but in|&s;tantly on perceiving us removed to ours, and paid us his compliments with his u&s;ual grace and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>The train of recollections that had preceded his entrance made me view him with redoubled plea&s;ure. Luckily there was a place vacant between Fanny and me, of which he took immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; nor did he think of quitting it till the inimitable comedy of the Jour|ney to London was concluded, for from &s;ome particular circum&s;tances the play had been changed. I was almo&s;t equally delighted with the repre&s;entation it&s;elf, and with the admirable and amu&s;ing ob|&s;ervations it drew from Mr. Roat&s;ley, who was if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more agreeable than when we pa&s;&s;ed the day with him at
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Dover. There is indeed a certain mix|ture of &s;weetne&s;s and vivacity blended both in his countenance and manners, that renders his conver&s;ation uncommonly plea&s;ing. I was much charmed to per|ceive that the denouement of the piece, which, though defective I think in point of delicacy, is exceedingly affecting, brought a tear of feeling into his eye: there is indeed &s;omething &s;o amiable in any unaffected &s;ymptoms of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility in a manly countenance, and it forms a contra&s;t &s;o attractive from that roughne&s;s and au&s;terity which is in gene|ral &s;eated upon their faces, that in my opinion it is the mo&s;t in&s;inuating of all prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and as it gives you in a manner an in&s;ight into the mind, ren|ders the figure it&s;elf infinitely more inte|re&s;ting. I &s;uppo&s;e it was owing to this ob&s;ervation that Mr. Roat&s;ley never &s;truck me with being &s;o incomparably hand&s;ome as he did this evening.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">Had I even enjoyed le&s;s plea&s;ure at the repre&s;entation of a piece which I have &s;o often read with repeated &s;atis|faction, I &s;hould have been &s;ufficiently amu&s;ed and delighted from ob&s;erving the effect it produced on my dear Fanny, who was charmed beyond mea&s;ure by an exhibition &s;o entirely new, and of which my de&s;cription could have given her but a faint notion. Roat&s;ley &s;eemed both plea&s;ed and entertained with the innocent <HI>naivet&egrave;</HI> of her expre&s;&s;ions of wonder at all &s;he &s;aw, and with great goodne&s;s of heart enjoyed the entertainment &s;he drew from every object.</P>
<P>When the play was fini&s;hed, he left us for a few moments to pay his re&s;pects to a lady in another box; and &s;o comfort|able was the idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at lea&s;t one acquaintance amid&s;t &s;o many faces totally new, for we were placed at a di&s;tance from either Lady Farnford or her daughter, that I could not avoid being

apprehen&s;ive lea&s;t he &s;hould not again return; but in a &s;hort time he made his appearance, and re&s;umed his place, where he continued till we left the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>This day produced an event which has charmed both Fanny and me beyond mea&s;ure. We have unexpectedly met with an old friend, (for &s;uch in this part of the world we &s;hould deem almo&s;t any per&s;on whom we had known in our own country); and as &s;uch we cordially wel|comed our lively acquaintance, Mrs. Weldon, who arrived in town only the evening before la&s;t.</P>
<P>Fortunately &s;he had taken lodgings in the next &s;treet; and perceiving us in Mrs. Hindon's carriage pa&s;s her window in our way to church, &s;he made her foot|man watch our return, with a me&s;&s;age
<PB N="9" REF="10">
informing us of her abode, and reque&s;t|ing that we would take immediate ad|vantage of the information. Delighted with this intelligence, &s;o unexpected too, as Mrs. Weldon, when at the cha|teau, had not once dropped any hint of an intention to re-vi&s;it England, we re|que&s;ted Mrs. Hindon to &s;et us down at her hou&s;e. She gave us the kinde&s;t re|ception po&s;&s;ible: and on our part, we felt as if we had met one in whom we were warmly intere&s;ted, and who was nearly connected with us. She informed us that bu&s;ine&s;s relative to a legacy lately bequeathed her had obliged her to come over at a &s;udden call, and that &s;he had left our much re&s;pected friends in good health.</P>
<P>How &s;trangely do circum&s;tances, ap|parently the mo&s;t trifling, alter our opi|nions and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: this Mrs. Weldon, whom I thought at be&s;t but an agreeable coquet, and who&s;e friend&s;hip
<PB N="10" REF="11">
I had in Languedoc no &s;ort of de&s;ire to cultivate, now &s;carcely appears to me the per&s;on &s;he was, except in her powers of plea&s;ing, which are if po&s;&s;ible augmented. The change is not however entirely ow|ing to the partiality with which I could not but regard an acquaintance formed under the roof of our worthy friend; the alteration is in her&s;elf; and I now per|ceive how illiberal and injudicious are often the &s;entiments and impre&s;&s;ions in|&s;pired by an imperfect knowledge. Mrs. Weldon, in her own hou&s;e, and in pri|vate, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not merely the gaiety which amu&s;es, but that good &s;en&s;e and know|ledge of the world which mu&s;t charm and improve all who are admitted to an intimacy with her. The&s;e good qualities are blended with a flow of &s;pirits uncom|monly elevated, which diffu&s;es a vivacity over her manner and appearance that on a &s;uperficial acquaintance may be mi&s;taken for levity, but which, on a
<PB N="11" REF="12">
nearer view, I find proves merely the natural re&s;ult of a &s;prightly turn of mind, added to an early introduction into life; circum&s;tances that in general arive defiance to ba&s;hfulne&s;s, at lea&s;t to that painful degree of it that accompa|nies awkwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>She was &s;o kind as to in&s;i&s;t on our re|maining with her the whole day, and at her earne&s;t reque&s;t an apology was di&s;|patched to Mrs. Hindon; indeed I have not &s;pent one &s;o entirely to my &s;atisfac|tion &s;ince my arrival. Mrs. Weldon was equally amu&s;ing, whether we con|ver&s;ed on gay or &s;erious &s;ubjects; and uninterrupted by company, we chatted over affairs that mutually intere&s;ted us.</P>
<P>I was extremely &s;orry however to find that &s;he did not regard Madame de Cla|rence with that cordial e&s;teem which I imagined every one mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to feel for a character &s;o amiable; and &s;he let us into &s;ome little circum&s;tances re|lating
<PB N="12" REF="13">
to family di&s;&s;entions, which I ne|ver &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected to have oc|curred between a couple who always be|have, at lea&s;t in company, with the utmo&s;t apparent good humour and politene&s;s to each other. Mrs. Weldon even told us, that poor Madame de Clarence has an unfortunate failing in her temper, which renders her&s;elf and her hu&s;band equally mi&s;erable: &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it &s;eems, an un|happy degree of jealou&s;y, that leads her to conclude almo&s;t every young woman, who&s;e vi&s;its are frequent in the family, the object of Mon&s;ieur de Clarence's af|fections; and no &s;ooner is &s;he convinced of her error in one place, than her &s;u&s;|picions are turned to another quarter, however improbable and extraordinary.</P>
<P>This is a mo&s;t unfortunate di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;incerely to be lamented; for I fear, according to Mrs. Weldon's account, it is quite incurable. She gave me innu|merable in&s;tances of her weakne&s;s in this
<PB N="13" REF="14">
particular; and added, that as &s;he had been for &s;ome time an inmate of her fa|mily, &s;he had not failed her&s;elf to expe|rience the effects of her temper in this point.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize that this un|lucky foible &s;hould never have been hinted to me till now, nor the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of a turn of mind &s;o adver&s;e to her tranquillity ever occur to my mind during the whole period of my acquaint|ance with Madame de Clarence.</P>
<P>You was the la&s;t per&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, to whom &s;uch an information was likely to be &s;ugge&s;ted. The &s;trict intimacy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between you was &s;ufficiently known to deter all malicious or officious di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons from entertaining you with a topic &s;o little agreeable as the errors of your friend; and the circle you ranged in was ever &s;o limited, that large as is the proportion of the world which comes under the&s;e de&s;criptions, I believe
<PB N="14" REF="15">
there were very few of either cla&s;s that could be ranked among the number of your acquaintance.</P>
<P>But pray, added &s;he, had you never occa&s;ion to remark, during your la&s;t vi&s;it, that Madame behaved to me with a di&s;tance wholly unaccountable, and which mu&s;t, I think, have provoked both your ob&s;ervation and &s;urprize? The real truth of the matter was, that as my ac|quaintance with the family originated through Mon&s;ieur, who lived in terms of the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip with poor Mr. Weldon, and to whom I was in &s;ome mea&s;ure given in charge by my hu&s;band in his la&s;t moments, the lady never re|garded me with much kindne&s;s; but con&s;cious &s;he her&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not addre&s;s &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve her hu&s;band's affec|tions, &s;he &s;u&s;pects every pretty woman &s;he &s;ees to be more in favour than her&s;elf, and charitably accu&s;es her of the theft.</P>
<P>That Madame de Clarence di&s;approved
<PB N="15" REF="16">
of Mrs. Weldon's behaviour I well knew, nor was I ignorant that &s;he was no great favourite with that lady; but as I could not my&s;elf avoid joining in the cen&s;ure which her coquetry incurred, it made no impre&s;&s;ion on my mind at the time, nor could excite either &s;urprize or &s;u&s;pi|cion: our lively little friend, mean while, happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of unbounded &s;pirits, dreamt not of this &s;evere judg|ment on her gaiety till after Fanny and I left the chateau, when the augmented re|&s;erve and &s;olemn deportment of Madame de Clarence &s;oon gave place to an open manife&s;tation of her repugnance and di&s;|like.</P>
<P>Her &s;ententious harangues, &s;aid Mrs. Weldon, (who always expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf with force, and on this occa&s;ion may be forgiven the exaggeration of re&s;entment) and thread bare lectures on the dignity of a proper retinue in the &s;ex, were &s;ud|denly converted into plain invectives
<PB N="16" REF="17">
again&s;t the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent age, and the unprincipled levity of all its daughters, whether maids, wives, or widows; tho&s;e of the latter denomina|tion had, you may believe, &s;ufficient ju&s;tice done them; till at la&s;t it was im|po&s;&s;ible for me any longer to mi&s;take my own re&s;emblance in the pictures me con|tinually drew of tho&s;e profligate females, who having buried the man, either agreeable or otherwi&s;e, who had once received their vows, dared to be happy, and pre&s;umed to confe&s;s it too after they had regained their freedom.</P>
<P>For my own part, continued &s;he, united by my friends early in life to a man twice my age, I am &s;atisfied with having performed my duty to him when alive, without con&s;idering my&s;elf as obliged to mourn his lo&s;s when gone; and ble&s;&s;ed with con&s;cious innocence, I allow my&s;elf tho&s;e liberties in which a mind free and at ea&s;e is glad to rejoice
<PB N="17" REF="18">
after a tedious bondage. However, find|ing Madame de Clarence was always grave when I laughed, and &s;orrowful when I was gay, I began to &s;u&s;pect that I had worn out her patience by too long a vi&s;it, and under this notion was pre|paring to take a civil departure, when one day, in the little arbour, (you may remember it I believe, it is at the en|trance into the wood) in the little arbour, where I had taken refuge in a fine even|ing, to avoid exciting a rudene&s;s of be|haviour for which I could a&s;&s;ign no ade|quate motive, I was unexpectedly joined by Mon&s;ieur; who &s;eeing me &s;eated, na|turally enough, you know, placed him|&s;elf by me and entered into conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>On mentioning my intentions of leav|ing the chateau next morning, he con|fe&s;&s;ed, with an ingenuity which our friend&s;hip of long &s;tanding fully autho|rized, that he could not but approve of the prudence which dictated this &s;tep,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
and acknowledged to me that a jealou&s;y of temper, which formed, he &s;aid, the mi&s;ery of both their lives, had &s;o encrea&s;ed in&s;tead of abating with his wife's years, that it was grown quite in&s;upportable: it is then no wonder, added he, in a friendly manner, that you &s;hould at la&s;t become the object of her &s;u&s;picions, &s;ince fifty women, fifty times your inferior, have by turns excited them.</P>
<P>This I allow, continued Mrs. Weldon, mu&s;t have &s;ounded &s;omewhat compli|mentary to an ear, the organs of which were di&s;ordered by jealou&s;y; and ju&s;t at that in&s;tant who &s;hould we &s;ee gliding by the trees but Madame her&s;elf, who had been without doubt li&s;tening to a &s;ketch of her own character, not much either &s;oftened or embelli&s;hed from the lips of her hu&s;band, and done perhaps rather a little in <HI>caracatura.</HI> But one mu&s;t pardon him &s;ome degree of exag|geration
<PB N="19" REF="20">
from a ju&s;t exa&s;peration at her uncea&s;ing and teazing importunities.</P>
<P>After this little adventure, you may &s;uppo&s;e it was time for me to be gone. Madame pretended indi&s;po&s;ition, and kept her room the re&s;t of the evening; breakfa&s;ted next morning <HI>chez elle</HI>; and I left the chateau, having received only a me&s;&s;age that &s;he was &s;orry &s;he could not &s;ee me before I went.</P>
<P>Poor Madame de Clarence! I pity her from my &s;oul: it was indeed impo&s;&s;ible to hear that my worthy friend was un|happy, even though owing to her own unfortunate weakne&s;s, without &s;incerely deploring that fault which is attended, I am convinced, by no other in her bo|&s;om: but what a number of great and amiable qualities will not this &s;ingle er|ror ob&s;cure in a hu&s;band's eyes.</P>
<P>Till now, I always concluded Mon|&s;ieur in fault; and that to the cold civi|lity of his manner, tho&s;e clouds were
<PB N="20" REF="21">
owing which during our la&s;t vi&s;it I &s;ome|times ob&s;erved hanging on his lady's brow. He was always indeed &s;crupu|lou&s;ly polite in his attentions to her; but his behaviour &s;eemed the &s;tudied effu|&s;ions of good breeding and propriety, to which, from her rank in life, and the &s;plendid fortune &s;he brought him, &s;he ju&s;tly lays claim. I heartily lament however, that &s;he &s;hould have carried her &s;u&s;picions to lengths &s;o blameable: lengths which mu&s;t operate towards aug|menting the alienation &s;he deplores.</P>
<P>This unexpected and delightful ren|contre, together with the agreeable alter|ation in Mrs. Weldon's manners, entirely di&s;carded the re&s;erve with which I u&s;ed formerly to conver&s;e with her; and upon her talking openly of her affairs, which are at pre&s;ent &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed, I made no &s;cruple of acquainting her with the circum&s;tances of our &s;ituation, &s;o re|plete
<PB N="21" REF="22">
with difficulties, &s;o &s;ingularly per|plexing and uncomfortable.</P>
<P>She entered kindly and with intere&s;t into all our anxieties, and told us that &s;ome years ago Lady Linro&s;e and her family were not unknown to her. That was before &s;he &s;eparated from her hu&s;|band, &s;aid &s;he; but &s;he never was a wo|man by any means to my ta&s;te; for though her Lady&s;hip can make her&s;elf extremely agreeable where &s;he plea&s;es, &s;he is intolerably proud, exceedingly fond of money, and as artful as the devil. I dare to &s;ay &s;he was more to blame than her Lord, though &s;he has been cun|ning enough to per&s;uade the world, and even Lord Belmont, that his peevi&s;h humour rendered her life a burthen to her. No doubt he was a very capricious, ill tempered man; but I believe he had provocation &s;ufficient. I a&s;k pardon, however, my dears, for talking of your
<PB N="22" REF="23">
aunt with &s;o little ceremony; though to own the truth, when you come to know her as well as I do, your opinion will probably coincide with mine.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured Mrs. Weldon &s;he might u&s;e all manner of freedom, and eagerly en|quired if all the family exhibited portraits equally unfavourable.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t daughter, &s;aid &s;he, is as proud to the full as her mother, and &s;till more deficient in good humour; but the &s;econd, who was &s;carce twelve years old when I left England, was the &s;weete&s;t, mo&s;t enchanting little girl in the world; and I really think re&s;embled you, Mi&s;s Seymour, extremely. There was always &s;ome per&s;on in my head, when I &s;aw you in Languedoc, that you &s;truck me with having a likene&s;s to, and now I recollect it is your cou&s;in, Mi&s;s Lucy Dudley. There is another daughter, but &s;he was then quite a child; and there are two &s;ons; the elde&s;t is a very good young
<PB N="23" REF="24">
man I am told, but his talents I believe are not &s;hining; the younge&s;t, however, when I la&s;t &s;aw him, was a blooming youth of eighteen, captivating as an Adonis, and in all re&s;pects amiable and engaging. I hear he has by no means di&s;appointed the hopes in&s;pired by his juvenile perfections, either in point of mind or per&s;on, for he is by all accounts a very extraordinary young man, and I have been informed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a degree of influence over Lord Belmont, with whom he is at pre&s;ent abroad, which I think you mu&s;t regard as a favourable circum&s;tance in your &s;ituation; for a &s;ingle glance from either of you mu&s;t intere&s;t him in your cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon's carriage being at this time announced, we took our leave, and on our return found a card of invitation from Lady Farnford to accompany her to the play to-morrow evening.</P>

<P>We were delighted beyond expre&s;&s;ion la&s;t night. The inimitable Mrs. Siddons &s;urpa&s;&s;es all that can either be conceived or de&s;cribed. Added to the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite ta&s;te and feeling, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a coun|tenance the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive, over which &s;he enjoys a command the mo&s;t incon|ceivable.</P>

all powerful as &s;he is, could not wholly engro&s;s it; for on ca&s;ting my eyes round the hou&s;e, I di&s;covered Mr. Roat&s;|ley in the adjoining box. As he &s;at a|lone, I could not avoid flattering my&s;elf that he would join us as he had done the week before, and Fanny and I could have ea&s;ily contrived room for him, although the hou&s;e was extremely crouded; but to my no &s;mall regret he did not appear to have the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of ap|proaching. On perceiving us he indeed in&s;tantly bowed; but with a degree of coldne&s;s and re&s;erve which almo&s;t di&s;con|certed me; and though from the acci|dental change of places there was a &s;pare &s;eat by us mo&s;t part of the evening, far from wi&s;hing to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, he never once came near the box.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed at a change really &s;triking, as well as unaccountable after the flow of civility with which he had before attended us at the &s;ame place, I tried in vain to
<PB N="26" REF="27">
di&s;cover what could po&s;&s;ibly have occa|&s;ioned the alteration; but I could only re&s;t my conclu&s;ions on that ficklene&s;s and caprice of which all his &s;ex have been &s;o vehemently accu&s;ed by ours, and of which, though I have &s;een nothing, I have read and heard much.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this idea, I endeavoured to &s;atisfy my&s;elf; but another &s;oon ac|companied it, which partook perhaps not a little of the weakne&s;s attributed to our &s;ex: I &s;u&s;pected that we did not improve upon intimacy; and that di&s;appointed in the expectations which at fir&s;t induced him to cultivate the acquaintance, he wi&s;hed to let it drop. Soon after the fir&s;t act was concluded, I took notice that we were evidently the &s;ubject of his conver&s;ation with another gentleman who had joined him; an idea which you may believe did not le&s;&s;en my perplexity.</P>
<P>Roat&s;ley &s;eemed to regard me with looks of anxious gravity; while the coun|tenance
<PB N="27" REF="28">
of his companion, whom to my no &s;mall &s;urprize I recollected to be our late fellow lodger, Captain Brad&s;haw, manife&s;ted nothing but &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the fourth act was concluded, Lady Farnford beckoned to a lady be|hind, de&s;iring her to inform her &s;on, who could not get admittance for the croud, that a &s;eat was kept for him on the bench on which I was &s;itting.</P>
<P>Way was therefore made for the gen|tleman: but gue&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment and regret, when I found that this &s;on of Lady Farnford's was the profligate and audacious young man who had terrified me at Mrs. Brumpton's. I was &s;hocked on &s;eeing him; nor was my perturbation abated, you may believe, from finding that his mother meant to place him by me.</P>
<P>Without having time to con&s;ider, I determined that no degree of ill-judged ba&s;hfulne&s;s &s;hould prevent me from ma|nife&s;ting
<PB N="28" REF="29">
a re&s;entment &s;o ju&s;tly incurred; I therefore ha&s;tily entreated a lady who &s;at on the bench behind, to allow me to change places with her, as I wi&s;hed to &s;peak with my &s;i&s;ter; and having by this little artifice contrived to place my&s;elf at &s;ome di&s;tance from him, I pretended to be earne&s;tly engaged in conver&s;ation with Fanny. Lady Farnford however &s;oon tapped me with her fan, and a&s;ked leave to introduce her &s;on. I was then ab&s;o|lutely obliged to turn round, and per|ceived in his countenance an a&s;toni&s;h|ment and confu&s;ion which ought indeed to have wholly overpowered him; but he &s;eemed to recover him&s;elf very &s;peed|ily, at lea&s;t he obtained &s;ufficient com|mand over his feelings to pay me the u&s;ual compliments, though I believe, for I hardly deigned to look at him, not without embarra&s;ment. As for me, I &s;carcely bowed my head, and in&s;tantly
<PB N="29" REF="30">
turned from him with unfeigned indig|nation.</P>
<P>I believe his mother was not a little confounded at the rudene&s;s of my beha|viour; but without giving my&s;elf the trouble of con&s;idering what interpretation &s;he might put on it, I continued to talk with Fanny, who was almo&s;t equally vexed at this rencontre.</P>
<P>I &s;aw Roat&s;ley's eyes were fixed on our party, and perceived him whi&s;per his friend. Overcome with a variety of emo|tions, added to the inten&s;e heat, I felt my&s;elf now &s;uddenly extremely &s;ick, and apprehen&s;ive of fainting, immediate aro&s;e. You may conjecture the bu&s;tle which en|&s;ued: I was carried out almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, &s;upported in the arms of the odious Farnford, who ventured to a&s;&s;i&s;t me while I was unable to repul&s;e him, and attended by his mother and Fanny.</P>
<P>They &s;topped in the pa&s;&s;age to give me air and admini&s;ter eau de luce,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
&s;alts, &amp;c. before they ventured to call a chair, and ju&s;t at that in&s;tant Roat&s;ley and his friend came up. The former, hoping I was recovering from the bad effects of the heat, walked on with a for|mal bow; and the other giving Farnford a &s;ignificant &s;mile, &s;aid to him in a loud whi&s;per as he pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;I give you joy Farnford; there is no need of my intro|duction now I perceive.</P>
<P>Shocked to the &s;oul, I exerted all my returning &s;trength, and di&s;engaging my|&s;elf entirely from Farnford, who had pre|&s;umed to &s;upport me with his arm, I told Lady Farnford I was much better, and wi&s;hed in&s;tantly to go home in a chair, as Mrs. Hindon's carriage could not have arrived &s;o early.</P>
<P>If you think there is no danger of a relap&s;e, an&s;wered &s;he, in my opinion Mi&s;s Seymour you had better return to your place till my &s;on enquires if my coach, which &s;hall obey your commands, is in waiting.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">I in&s;i&s;ted however upon going directly; and her &s;on, who &s;eemed to aim at co|vering the awkwardne&s;s he could not avoid feeling under an appearance of rude indifference, &s;aid, with an air of uncon|cern, O you can ea&s;ily have a couple of chairs if you will go, and walked away to order them.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he was glad of an opportu|nity of leaving us; for to my great joy in&s;tead of returning him&s;elf he &s;ent a boxkeeper to inform us that chairs were procured.</P>
<P>Where is my &s;on? cried Lady Farn|ford. But happily no &s;on appeared; and de&s;iring that her footman might be or|dered to &s;ee us &s;afe home, &s;he wi&s;hed us good night.</P>
<P>When we came to the door, we found Farnford &s;tanding with Mr. Roat&s;ley and Captain Brad&s;haw. Will you give me leave to &s;ee you through the crowd? &s;aid Farnford to me with the mo&s;t perfect
<PB N="32" REF="33">
ea&s;e. I replied only by withdrawing the hand he had &s;eized, and by an air (I can|not call it a look for I had &s;carce courage to look at him) of aver&s;ion and con|tempt. He was di&s;concerted I believe; but covering it with a &s;mile of effrontery, &s;tepped back, and in&s;tantly Mr. Roat&s;ley advancing, offered his &s;ervices with a po|litene&s;s and re&s;pect which gave me the only &s;en&s;ation of &s;atisfaction I had felt that evening. I curt&s;eyed in &s;ilence; and accepting his hand, he conducted me to my chair, after which he left me to per|form the &s;ame office to Fanny.</P>
<P>Fortunately Mr. and Mrs. Hindon were both engaged abroad, &s;o that I in|&s;tantly went to bed; where in&s;tead of &s;leeping I ruminated mo&s;t part of the night on the di&s;agreeable occurrences of the preceding day.</P>
<P>My reflections were not indeed of the mo&s;t comfortable nature. My dear fa|ther's lo&s;s, attended, alas! by a multi|tude
<PB N="33" REF="34">
of circum&s;tances additionally pain|ful and perplexing, have kept my mind for &s;ome months pa&s;t in a &s;tate of uncea&s;|ing agitation; and the &s;u&s;pence in which we continue at pre&s;ent, from the unac|countable &s;ilence of Lady Linro&s;e to Mr. Howard's letter, con&s;pires to give me un&s;peakable unea&s;ine&s;s. My pa&s;t &s;uffer|ings, as well as pre&s;ent anxieties, by weakening my mind and exhau&s;ting my &s;pirits, render me doubly &s;u&s;ceptible of every &s;light vexation; the probability therefore, nay almo&s;t certainty, in &s;pite of my mo&s;t vigilant precautions, of meet|ing frequently with Captain Farnford while I re&s;ide in a family who are upon a footing of intimacy with his, di&s;tre&s;&s;es me prodigiou&s;ly, and I mu&s;t al&s;o confe&s;s, although I am &s;en&s;ible how ab&s;urd be|yond mea&s;ure it is to allow my&s;elf to be hurt from the caprice of others, that I cannot help regretting the change in Mr. Roat&s;ley's behaviour, becau&s;e he appears
<PB N="34" REF="35">
&s;o extremely oppo&s;ite from a man who would permit him&s;elf to be governed by mere whim. My thoughts are con&s;tantly employed in conjecturing what could po&s;|&s;ibly have occa&s;ioned an alteration &s;o ap|parent. It is however of little importance in it&s;elf; but it is &s;o different from his former behaviour that &s;ome prejudice mu&s;t have excited him to this conduct; and there is not I believe a more painful &s;en&s;ation than that occa&s;ioned by having unju&s;tly lo&s;t the good opinion of tho&s;e we e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that we hear no|thing of Lady Linro&s;e? We begin to fear the letter cannot have found its way to her Lady&s;hip. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>DEC. 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY morning, Mrs. Hin|don, whom as yet I had not let into any particulars relating to the odious Farn|ford, informed me that Sir Jonathan's family were that day to take a Chri&s;tmas dinner with us. You have hardly &s;een the be&s;t part of it, &s;aid &s;he. Their &s;on, the Captain, is a mighty pretty young man, and extremely clever and agreea|ble. He wi&s;hes of all things in the world to be introduced to you; and her Lady|&s;hip told me he has ab&s;olutely raved about Mi&s;s Seymour &s;ince he &s;aw her two nights
<PB N="36" REF="37">
ago at the play. He &s;wears there was nobody there to be compared with her either for grace or beauty. He has been out of town lately, or you &s;hould have &s;een him before now. I a&s;&s;ure you, ladies, continued &s;he, before I had time to reply, he is no contemptible conque&s;t. Be&s;ides his father's fortune, which to be &s;ure is not &s;o good as it has been, he has expectations from a rich relation, and is an only &s;on, with the incumbrance of but one &s;i&s;ter's fortune, and &s;he you &s;ee is a puny, poor thing. Lady Farnford brought a good fifteen hundred per an|num with her. Sir Jonathan's e&s;tate was originally as much more; and al|though no doubt &s;ome of it is gone, there are &s;till excellent pickings left. They have been &s;ome years on a frugal plan too; &s;o that I dare &s;ay things are almo&s;t clear by this time. Indeed, Mi&s;s Sey|mour, I wi&s;h with all my heart this may turn out a match. You know the young
<PB N="37" REF="38">
man is my cou&s;in; and I &s;hould be happy to have the honour of being related to you. Come, Mi&s;s Fanny, don't you think it would do charmingly.</P>
<P>I am not acquainted with him, &s;aid Fanny drily.</P>
<P>Well, I hope you'll both become bet|ter acquainted with him in time. But Lord look how Mi&s;s Seymour blu&s;hes: well things will come about, I'll lay a good wager, cried &s;he, laughing immo|derately at the confu&s;ion which the &s;ound of the wretches name unavoidably occa|&s;ioned me. Come, continued &s;he, with her u&s;ual volubility, you &s;aw him at the play I know; well tell truth hone&s;tly, is he not extremely hand&s;ome?</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, an&s;wered I, I am &s;orrow to differ from you; but I don't think he has the &s;lighte&s;t preten&s;ions to it.</P>
<P>Nay this is downright coquetry. I'm certain you cannot think as you &s;peak.
<PB N="38" REF="39">
You are afraid I'll tell; but I promi&s;e you I &s;hall keep the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>I hope then you will allow me to entru&s;t you with it, cried I much pro|voked and in the mid&s;t of a long ha|rangue, for when eager on a &s;ubject Mrs. Hindon never allows any one but her&s;elf to talk. I interrupted her by ex|plaining the too ju&s;t occa&s;ion her cou&s;in had given me for the mo&s;t determined repugnance and di&s;like. I &s;oon how|ever regretted the confidence I had placed in her, when I found that in&s;tead of being &s;hocked at the recital, &s;he appeared &s;o highly entertained that I thought &s;he would have fallen from her chair, &s;he laughed &s;o violently.</P>
<P>Oh! cried &s;he at length, I never heard &s;uch a good &s;tory in my life. And &s;o he really mi&s;took you for a woman of the town? How confounded then he mu&s;t have been to find you in his mo|ther's party, and placed on the &s;ame
<PB N="39" REF="40">
bench with her at Drury-lane. I &s;hould have been quite delighted to have &s;een his a&s;toni&s;hment and confu&s;ion: he mu&s;t have looked &s;o droll.</P>
<P>There could not have been much <HI>con|fu&s;ion</HI> in the ca&s;e, &s;aid I, &s;ince he wi&s;hes to throw him&s;elf again in my way.</P>
<P>No doubt he is &s;en&s;ible of his error, and de&s;ires to be received into favour.</P>
<P>I then very &s;eriou&s;ly told her that I was determined not to &s;ee Captain Farn|ford if I po&s;&s;ibly could avoid it, and would be infinitely obliged to her if &s;he would be &s;o kind as to inform me when &s;he knew of his vi&s;its, entreating that &s;he would permit me to keep my apart|ment on &s;uch occa&s;ions. To this, after &s;ome remon&s;trances, &s;he unwilling con|&s;ented; though I could ea&s;ily perceive &s;he thought my behaviour an unnece&s;&s;ary refinement of delicacy, which I had im|po&s;ed on my&s;elf out of an ab&s;urd idea of propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">After the company were gone, Mrs. Hindon returned to relieve me, &s;he &s;aid, from my impri&s;onment, and entertained me the whole remaining part of the even|ing with the Captain's accompli&s;hments: he was the mo&s;t agreeable young man&mdash; &s;o like a man of fa&s;hion&mdash;&s;o much at his ea&s;e&mdash;&s;o lively&mdash;indeed, Mi&s;s Seymour, you mu&s;t have been quite molified had you &s;een how di&s;mal and mortified he looked during dinner.</P>
<P>What, Madam, cried I, after being &s;o lively.</P>
<P>Oh I mean when your indi&s;po&s;ition was mentioned: and indeed I could &s;carcely talk of it without laughing; to think you was above &s;tairs in perfect health all the while he was regretting your illne&s;s as &s;o great a misfortune. However I whi&s;pered the truth to her Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>I am indeed extremely &s;orry you did, Madam, cried I. I thought you had promi&s;ed me not to mention to any per|&s;on
<PB N="41" REF="42">
an adventure in which I blu&s;h ever to have been involved.</P>
<P>Oh! there was no harm, you know, in telling it to Lady Farnford. I a&s;&s;ure you &s;he blamed her &s;on very much, and &s;aid &s;he did not wonder at your re&s;ent|ment; only &s;he hoped it would not be carried too far; for that he was mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately in love with you, and tho' he had been too much penetrated with his behaviour to confe&s;s it to her when his fir&s;t meeting with you took place, &s;he was certain he was thoroughly vexed at the accident, which mu&s;t have entirely re&s;ulted from intoxication and his mi&s;tak|ing you for one of tho&s;e ladies who appear in &s;uch crowds in the du&s;k of the even|ing; for nothing on earth Captain Farn|ford wi&s;hed &s;o anxiou&s;ly as to render him&s;elf agreeable to you: and indeed, Mi&s;s Seymour, I mu&s;t own, that to make too much fu&s;s about this affair is be&s;tow|ing an importance on it greater than it
<PB N="42" REF="43">
de&s;erves. It would be better, I &s;hould imagine, after having te&s;tified your di&s;|plea&s;ure as you have now &s;ufficiently done, to appear as if you had forgot it.</P>
<P>Forgot it, Madam! cried I. I mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a very &s;light memory indeed if I am capable of forgetting behaviour like his. I do not intend to make any fu&s;s about it; all I wi&s;h is to avoid him; and if chance &s;hould introduce him where I am, all the re&s;entment I &s;hould di&s;cover would be to regard him as an utter &s;tranger. I have &s;een enough of his character to cure me of all de&s;ire for his acquaintance; and as to the pa&s;&s;ion you tell me he has conceived for me, and which mu&s;t be altogether imaginary, give me leave to &s;ay that had I never beheld him in a point of view &s;o di&s;a|greeable, it would have been equally un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>I pronounced this in a tone &s;o grave
<PB N="43" REF="44">
and determined, that Mrs. Hindon looked &s;urprized.</P>
<P>Well, well, Mi&s;s Seymour, I had no commi&s;&s;ion to carry the Captain's pro|po&s;als, &s;o have no intention to be the bearer of his refu&s;al; and &s;oon after Mr. Hindon coming in, the conver&s;ation &s;hifted to other topics.</P>
<P>This morning a card arrived from Sir Jonathan and Lady Farnford, enquiring after my health, and adding, that they hoped it would not prevent me from ac|companying my &s;i&s;ter and this family to dinner with them on Thur&s;day. Mrs. Hindon di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me exceedingly by ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in a re&s;olution to remain at home if we would not con&s;ent to go; and though I was both teized and vexed at her ill-judged civility, I was con&s;trained to make her &s;uffer for her complai&s;ance. A polite apology was therefore di&s;patched.</P>

<P>This moment, Sophia, a card is brought from Lady Linro&s;e. She is in town, and writes as follows:</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e pre&s;ents her compli|ments to Mr. Howard, and reque&s;ts he would take the trouble to call in St. James's Square this evening about &s;ix o'clock, as Lady Linro&s;e wi&s;hes to con|ver&s;e with him on the &s;ubject of the let|ter &s;he received &s;ome time &s;ince.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia! how infinitely intere&s;t|ing are the&s;e few lines. The agitation they have given us is un&s;peakable. I believe Fanny has read them over fifty times, and examined with eagerne&s;s and curio&s;ity the formation of every letter. She draws a favourable interpretation from Lady Linro&s;e being arrived in town,
<PB N="45" REF="46">

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>DEC. 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Well, my dear&mdash;But I will not antici|pate. Mr. Howard, who&s;e friendly anxiety equalled if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed our own, went to St. James's Square, a few mi|nutes before &s;ix, and was u&s;hered into the drawing room, where her Lady&s;hip allowed him to wait a full hour before &s;he made her appearance.</P>
<P>She then entered. He de&s;cribed her to us (for you may believe we were mi|nute in our enquiries) as a woman of a very maje&s;tic figure, but who&s;e addre&s;s, imperious and di&s;dainful, freezes the
<PB N="46" REF="47">
beholder at fir&s;t &s;ight, and in&s;pires only di&s;tance and re&s;erve.</P>
<P>I had the favour of a letter from you &s;ome time ago, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, but as I imagined the &s;ubject of which it treated would be better di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by an inter|view than by writing, I delayed an an|&s;wer till it was in my power to come to town. You tell me Sir, continued &s;he, that two daughters of the late unfortu|nate Lord Linro&s;e are come over from his retreat in France, under the idea that my Lord Belmont will be induced to countenance and acknowledge them. This, admitting that <HI>they really are</HI> his children, was &s;urely a very &s;trange and unaccountable &s;tep. It is indeed extra|ordinary to &s;uppo&s;e that his Lord&s;hip, &s;o ju&s;tly irritated again&s;t their father, who&s;e ill conduct, not to &s;ay crimes, have been the de&s;truction of his peace and the ruin of his con&s;titution, will be ea&s;ily if ever prevailed with to fa|vour
<PB N="47" REF="48">
with his notice, two girls who are the pledges of family di&s;honour, and the offspring of a calamity which has loaded his declining years with affliction. I think it would have been at lea&s;t prudent in their friends to have advi&s;ed them to &s;ound my Lord's inten|tions before they ventured on a proceed|ing &s;o ra&s;h as that of leaving the Conti|nent without his permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard then explained that our journey was in con&s;equence of the com|mands of a gentleman who had been left our guardian, but who on our arri|val we found had unfortunately expired a few days before.</P>
<P>I am much &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;aid &s;he, that any gentleman &s;hould take upon him to act in &s;uch intricate circum&s;tances without my Lord Belmont's approbation, who alone was empowered to fix their re&s;i|dence where he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Ben&s;eley could not be certain,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
Madam, &s;aid Mr. Howard, that my Lord would at all concern him&s;elf about his grand children, after the unhappy event which had &s;o long excluded them from his knowledge: it was therefore natural in him to propo&s;e what plan he thought mo&s;t conducive to their advantage, de|ferring an application to his Lord&s;hip till the arrival of the young ladies in England; when he doubted not they would &s;ufficiently plead their own cau&s;e the moment they were pre&s;ented to his &s;ight.</P>
<P>Indeed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of natural affec|tion, continued Mr. Howard, would have been, I am per&s;uaded, hardly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubdue his Lord&s;hip's feelings on this occa&s;ion; however irritated they might prove, a heart like Lord Belmont's could not have beheld unmoved, two lovely young women, ble&s;t with every amiable quality of the heart and every in&s;inuating grace of the form, kneeling
<PB N="49" REF="50">
at his feet for favour; and I am con|vinced when your Lady&s;hip has once &s;een them, an in&s;tantaneous prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion mu&s;t inevitably follow.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip, had he been in Eng|land, replied &s;he with coldne&s;s, would doubtle&s;s have acted in that ca&s;e as he thought proper. I perceive however, Sir, that you appear much too &s;anguine in your expectations. None of Lord Belmont's friends have ever dared for many years to revive the recollection of the unhappy tran&s;actions relating to the late Lord, by any mention of him or his family; a &s;ubject which mu&s;t have given an infinite &s;hock to a frame &s;o ex|hau&s;ted and reduced as my Lord's now is; nor is it my own private opinion, founded on a perfect knowledge of the inflexibility of his temper, that he will ever be per&s;uaded to be&s;tow his favour or countenance on his unfortunate &s;on's children.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">My endeavours, however, &s;hall not be wanting, Sir, to prevail with him, if po&s;|&s;ible, to perform what certainly would be an act of humanity; and as the young ladies are probably anxious to know their de&s;tiny, &s;hall not only write to Lord Belmont to enforce their claims, but &s;hall take courage to a&s;&s;ail him with all the rhetoric in my power. He is at pre|&s;ent at Nice, and his an&s;wer cannot be long in finding its way hither.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard thanked her Lady&s;hip in warm terms for this offer, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;oftened the har&s;h &s;everity of her preceding di&s;cour&s;e, and kindly added a thou&s;and circum&s;tances and recommenda|tions calculated to animate and encourage the dawning intere&s;t &s;he began to te&s;tify in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>There is however one thing I mu&s;t premi&s;e Sir, added &s;he; the young la|dies may perhaps be led to expect that I will invite them to my hou&s;e, and give
<PB N="51" REF="52">
them my notice and protection; but till my Lord's re&s;olution is known, I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from venturing on a conduct which I have rea&s;on to apprehend may meet with his di&s;approbation. The hour that brings me his Lord&s;hip's permi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall receive my nieces with all the cordiality and &s;atisfaction imaginable; till that arrives, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay that I think the more private they remain, and the le&s;s they are beheld in public, the better; and I &s;hould advi&s;e their friends to per&s;uade them into this mea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard, who by the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>their friends</HI> knew was meant only him|&s;elf, replied&mdash;your Lady&s;hip cannot ima|gine that in this country, where the young ladies arrived &s;o lately, they po&s;|&s;e&s;s many friends; but I hope, as they are perfectly de&s;erving of tho&s;e given them by nature, a prejudice, which you mu&s;t allow me to call unju&s;t, will not
<PB N="52" REF="53">
deprive them of one day po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their regard. I make no doubt but that till Lord Belmont's an&s;wer arrives, or till their relations choo&s;e to introduce them, they will not of them&s;elves incline either to a&s;&s;ume the family name, which they have not yet borne, or to appear in the world as his grand children.</P>
<P>In this particular I approve extremely of their prudence and delicacy, an&s;wered her Lady&s;hip, and &s;incerely wi&s;h them the &s;ucce&s;s their conduct in this point &s;o ju&s;tly merits. Indeed it would be the height of impropriety to let the world into tho&s;e family &s;ecrets, till they can with propriety be di&s;clo&s;ed; and they ought undoubtedly to continue under the name of Seymour till Lord Belmont al|lows of the change; and in the interim I &s;hall mo&s;t willingly undertake to con|vey any letter or packet the young la|dies may be inclined to tran&s;mit to my Lord Belmont.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">Well, my dear Sir, cried Fanny, who had watched his return at the window, what &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
<P>I am not much plea&s;ed with the intelli|gence your countenance divulges, cried I.</P>
<P>My face is not then to be tru&s;ted, &s;aid he, for at this moment I &s;carce know whether to be plea&s;ed or not. Lady Linro&s;e has di&s;&s;atisfied me without giv|ing me any ju&s;t grounds for complaint. She expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in your favour, and a&s;&s;ures me &s;he will back your claims with all her intere&s;t, yet her manner, unintere&s;ted and cold, contradicts what her tongue avers, and though rectitude may compel her to be your advocate, genero&s;ity will not, I fear, induce her warmly to become your friend.</P>
<P>He then related minutely and cir|cum&s;tantially all that had pa&s;&s;ed between them. I think, &s;aid he, when he had concluded, you ought undoubtedly to addre&s;s your grand father in your own
<PB N="54" REF="55">
name, nor tru&s;t to the pen of another a cau&s;e of &s;o much moment. A letter, warm from the heart, and breathing the genuine &s;entiments of duty and affection, cannot fail to &s;often and intere&s;t him.</P>
<P>I agreed perfectly in this opinion, and in&s;tantly retired to &s;et about the ta&s;k. You will perhaps imagine that it would not prove an ea&s;y one: but I found it attended with no &s;ort of difficulty. To write forcibly, little more is nece&s;&s;ary than to be animated thoroughly with your &s;ubject. In this ca&s;e, a thou&s;and expre&s;&s;ions of energy and warmth give a &s;trength and eloquence to your &s;tyle not to be attained by an unimpa&s;&s;ioned wri|ter; and as I did not affect what my heart did not feel, my epi&s;tle was ex|tremely &s;imple, though my tears, by blotting &s;everal, obliged me to write more than one copy.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF BELMONT.</HEAD>
<P>Will my Lord Belmont permit his grand children to addre&s;s him by the tender appellation which the ties of blood, and the mo&s;t fervent &s;entiments of duty and veneration, equally prompt them to u&s;e. Alas! it is but lately we knew there yet exi&s;ted a parent to whom the&s;e feelings were &s;till due; and the &s;ame in&s;tant that be&s;towed an information, &s;o unthought of, &s;o fraught with wonder and perplexity, overwhelmed us with the &s;udden knowledge of a thou&s;and cruel circum&s;tances to poi&s;on and embit|ter the plea&s;ing intelligence.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, not the lea&s;t dreadful is the apprehen&s;ion&mdash;an apprehen&s;ion which &s;inks us to the lowe&s;t ebb of de&s;pondency &mdash;that this venerable parent may forbid our claims, and remain, as he has hi|ther done, a &s;tranger and unknown to us.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">Oh! my Lord! can your heart always continue unmoved to the gentle and in|&s;inuating voice of nature; or in a bo|&s;om, where rectitude is &s;aid to hold its empire, can re&s;entment &s;o long retain its violence, and prejudice its inflexibility. Ah! no! one day I tru&s;t I &s;hall blu&s;h for having for an in&s;tant encouraged a &s;u&s;|picion &s;o unworthy, &s;o contrary to that ju&s;tice which forms, we are told, the ba|&s;is of Lord Belmont's character. We &s;hall not mourn a &s;econd father, more cruelly torn from us than by the hands of death, while the traces of tho&s;e tears which flowed for the fir&s;t are hardly ef|faced from our eyes.</P>
<P>We are in England, my Lord, by the advice of a gentleman who was left our guardian, and who I believe was once not unknown to you. We arrived about three weeks ago, and had the inexpre&s;&s;i|ble mortification to find that Mr. Ben&s;e|ley had expired but a few days before.
<PB N="57" REF="58">
To add to this misfortune, we were told your Lord&s;hip was abroad; and informed that till you conde&s;cended to acknow|ledge us, tho&s;e of our family who re|mained could not venture to afford us even their notice.</P>
<P>I think I need in&s;i&s;t on no further particulars in order to enforce to your Lord&s;hip how uncomfortable, how pain|fully depre&s;&s;ing, the &s;ituation of two young women mu&s;t prove, who find them&s;elves in a foreign and unknown country, unconnected in the mid&s;t of their numerous relations, and &s;trangers, tho' &s;urrounded by their natural friends.</P>
<P>Till your Lord&s;hip's re&s;olution with regard to us is made known, we mu&s;t continue in this ob&s;cure, this mi&s;erable &s;tate, unacknowledged, unnoticed, and de&s;erted, whil&s;t uncon&s;cious of meriting repul&s;e, or of de&s;erving this contempt and de&s;ertion.</P>

<P>I made Fanny join in the &s;ignature. It appeared very &s;trange to us to add a name &s;o entirely new, nor could I hardly per|&s;uade my&s;elf I had any right to claim it.</P>
<P>When the letter was fini&s;hed, I car|ried it down &s;tairs in order to &s;ubmit it to Mr. Howard's peru&s;al, who was for|tunately alone. He was affected with the warmth with which I had expre&s;&s;ed

Melted with the tender idea that I was yet allowed to addre&s;s my&s;elf to a &s;urviving parent, I effaced the writing with my tears. A tear dropped down the cheek of Mr. Howard while he read. If Lord Bel|mont can indeed remain deaf to the voice of nature, &s;aid he, when &s;he pleads in &s;uch language as this, his heart cannot have been compo&s;ed of tho&s;e flexible ma|terials of which tho&s;e of other men are formed.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JAN. 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS pre&s;uming wretch Farnford, in&s;tead of avoiding me, as I flattered my|&s;elf he would have done, after the repug|nance I have te&s;tified towards the &s;lighte&s;t intercour&s;e with him, this morning called while we were at breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>It was both painful and awkward for me to find my&s;elf in the &s;ame room with him; and in &s;pite of all Mrs. Hindon's attempts to draw me into conver&s;ation, I maintained a profound &s;ilence, looked grave and re&s;erved, and the moment I had done breakfa&s;t, left the parlour.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">Mrs. Hindon, with all her civility, &s;hews very little complai&s;ance in this particular. Though &s;he well knew the reluctance I felt to &s;eeing him, &s;he had undoubtedly invited him to &s;upper; for &s;oon after he was gone &s;he came up &s;tairs and informed me that the poor Captain found him&s;elf &s;o mi&s;erable when at a di&s;tance from me, that he had a&s;ked leave to return in the evening.</P>
<P>I &s;aid nothing, for certainly I had no right to pre&s;cribe to Mrs. Hindon what company &s;he &s;hould admit to her hou&s;e; but the moment &s;he left me, I took a chair to Mrs. Weldon's, and in the Captain's &s;tile a&s;ked leave to &s;pend the evening with her. She willingly con|&s;ented; and told me with her u&s;ual kind|ne&s;s that there were to be a few friends with her, who would be equally plea&s;ed with an addition &s;o agreeable to their party.</P>
<P>This is prudence with a witne&s;s, cried
<PB N="62" REF="63">
Mrs. Hindon, when I carele&s;sly in|formed her that I was engaged to &s;up abroad. 'Tis all I &s;uppo&s;e to avoid the poor Captain; but indeed Mi&s;s Seymour when you have &s;een as much of the world as I have done, you'll have a little more indulgence for the frolics of twenty-five.</P>
<P>That I might run no chance of being caught by Farnford, I went early to Mrs. Weldon's: but indeed my dear Sophia I heartily regret I went at all.</P>
<P>The gue&s;ts &s;he had mentioned, con|&s;i&s;ted of three gentlemen, who were ex|tremely gay and exce&s;&s;ively free in their manner. Their vivacity was indeed un|bounded; and their behaviour &s;o noi&s;y, not to &s;ay riotous, that I &s;hould have imagined they could have in&s;pired only the mo&s;t impenetrable gravity, in any fe|male companion. In&s;tead of this, how|ever, their mirth produced in Mrs. Wel|don a flow of &s;pirits &s;o unre&s;trained, that I could not avoid feeling to the la&s;t de|gree
<PB N="63" REF="64">
uncomfortable, and I would have given the world more than once for a pretence to have left the table.</P>
<P>I had not &s;ufficient courage however to betray &s;o pointedly my di&s;approbation; I therefore kept my &s;eat, determining in my own mind to refu&s;e in future all Mrs. Weldon's invitations except to a <HI>tete &agrave; tete,</HI> when &s;he always appears in a point of view both amiable and re&s;pect|able. But I took no part in the &s;urround|ing merriment, and very little in the con|ver&s;ation, although the gentlemen on each &s;ide addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to me in a &s;tyle of complimentary adoration perfectly new and almo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>The moment the cloth was removed, I ordered a chair; re&s;olving not to wait for Mrs. Hindon's carriage, which was to attend me at a later hour; and told Mrs. Weldon that as that family were extremely regular, I &s;hould be obliged to leave her &s;ooner than I wi&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">Indeed, cried the gentleman who &s;at on my right hand, and who had been par|ticularly violent in his expre&s;&s;ions of ad|miration, we &s;hall not permit you to be &s;o cruel; and he &s;eized my hand with an impetuo&s;ity which terrified me.</P>
<P>It is not indeed in my power to &s;tay, cried I, with no little re&s;entment in my voice. Mrs. Weldon joined earne&s;tly in entreating me not to break up the party; and the other gentlemen in&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;trongly, that I was ab&s;olutely con&s;trained to &s;it on, from the mere &s;hame of di&s;co|vering a degree of apprehen&s;ion for I knew not what.</P>
<P>The gentlemen now began to &s;ing a number of drinking, or as they termed it <HI>jovial</HI> &s;ongs; many of which, if I might judge from the manner they were received, were by no means adapted for female ears; and the gla&s;s circulated &s;o freely, that my &s;ituation every in&s;tant grew more di&s;agreeable. I was a&s;&s;ailed
<PB N="65" REF="66">
on each &s;ide with the mo&s;t extravagant flattery; and all my attempts to ri&s;e were received with &s;uch violent oppo&s;ition, that I had not re&s;olution to undergo them, and therefore forced my&s;elf to remain till it was near twelve. I then got up, and declared I was determined to go.</P>
<P>There is but one way of putting a pe|riod to &s;o barbarous a determination, cried one of the gentlemen, and &s;pringing forward to the door, he turned the key, and put it with an air of gay triumph into his pocket.</P>
<P>My con&s;ternation at this manoeuvre was beyond conception, and I turned to Mrs. Weldon with a look of a&s;toni&s;h|ment for which I could not find words. It was, you may conclude, not much abated from ob&s;erving that in&s;tead of openly avowing her di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he laughed extremely at my apparent di&s;|tre&s;s. Come my dear, cried &s;he, &s;ince you are kept pri&s;oner, tis in vain to re&s;i&s;t.
<PB N="66" REF="67">
Let us all &s;it down for an hour longer at lea&s;t, and Sir Edward will favour us with another &s;ong.</P>
<P>No, Madam, cried I much provoked, tis my intention to be gone, and go I will. I beg and entreat Sir, turning to the gentleman, you will open the door and allow me to be gone. I a&s;k it as a favour Sir.</P>
<P>Why then Madam, cried he gayly, with the grant of another you &s;hall pur|cha&s;e this favour with all my &s;oul.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t I do then? cried I.</P>
<P>Pay the door keeper, Madam, advanc|ing with an air of the mo&s;t impertinent effrontery.</P>
<P>Nay that's but ju&s;t by G&mdash; called out the others, bur&s;ting into a loud laugh.</P>
<P>I was &s;o confounded with this auda|cious behaviour, that I could not utter a &s;yllable; but retiring to my &s;eat, I turned &s;uddenly &s;ick, and grew &s;o pale that they all concluded I was going to faint.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">Mrs. Weldon's mirth, on ob&s;erving this change, was converted into appre|hen&s;ion. You have carried your wit greatly too far, Gentlemen, cried &s;he; and Sir Edward in&s;tantly procuring the key from the other, uttered a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of grief and regret for hav|ing given me a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Weldon then led me to her dre&s;|&s;ing room, from whence a &s;ervant was ordered to call a chair. She made me a thou&s;and apologies for having allowed me to be &s;o &s;everely tormented; but con|cluded, &s;he &s;aid, I would not mind the innocent frolic of a party of gay-hearted young men who were not quite &s;ober.</P>
<P>I do not think them proper company for either of us, Madam, in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, cried I, nor can I call a frolic inno|cent which was in my opinion to the la&s;t degree impudent to attempt and humilia|ting to receive.</P>
<P>I &s;poke with warmth, for indeed the
<PB N="68" REF="69">
party altogether had &s;hocked and con|founded me extremely.</P>
<P>Oh the pretty little prude, cried &s;he in a tone of ironical vivacity; indeed, my dear, you mu&s;t expect on entering the world to behold a number of things which will appear equally &s;trange and unaccountable to you. Pray do you imagine that all men are as grave as your father, or as &s;ententious as Mr. Howard? Young men will be gay, and &s;ometimes forget them&s;elves. I di&s;approve of any flagrant breach of propriety as much as you or any one el&s;e can do, but to be &s;ometimes ab&s;urd gives a gu&s;t to life.</P>
<P>The chair being now come, I bad her coldly adieu, and returned home ex|tremely hurt to perceive the notions of a per&s;on, for whom I really feel an af|fection, &s;o di&s;&s;imilar to my own, and grieved to find that her unfortunate &s;pi|rit of coquetry ob&s;cured and concealed a thou&s;and good qualities.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">Adieu! my Sophia. My de&s;ire to hear from you augments every hour. Your delightful journal, which u&s;ed for|merly to con&s;titute my chief amu&s;ement, will now prove my con&s;olation in all my troubles, as your friend&s;hip is my &s;up|port in every difficulty.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JAN. 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR kind packet was brought me this morning. A thou&s;and, thou&s;and thanks to my beloved Sophia, for the warm friend&s;hip and affection which breathes in every line. Such a friend, at all times an invaluable trea&s;ure, is in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more un&s;peakably precious: for when we now look around us, there remains not one other per&s;on, Madame de Clarence ex|cepted,
<PB N="71" REF="72">
to whom that tender appellation is due; and even &s;he is not a Sophia.</P>
<P>One part of your letter actually dyed my cheeks with blu&s;hes, although I read it in private. How can you rally me &s;o unmercifully becau&s;e I de&s;cribed our fel|low traveller to be what he really is&mdash;a very agreeable man. I did not tell you he was an Adonis, nor did I expre&s;s my&s;elf, if I recollect, in terms of greater warmth than the politene&s;s of his atten|tions merited from me. That he is hand&s;ome, and uncommonly engaging in his manner, is no more than you your|&s;elf mu&s;t have acknowledged had you al&s;o been of the party. I confe&s;s however I have been &s;everal times a lit|tle apprehen&s;ive of your animadver&s;ions upon different parts of my journal, tho' I did not imagine you would have taken &s;uch <HI>&s;trange</HI> notions &s;o <HI>early</HI> into your head.</P>
<P>If you have become already &s;u&s;picious,
<PB N="72" REF="73">
how much elated will you prove, and how vain of your &s;agacity, when you re|ceive the latter part of my journal, where you find I have again met with <HI>my hero,</HI> as you call him. I am con&s;cious I have laid my&s;elf &s;till more open to ridicule in &s;ome of my la&s;t packets than even when you took the hint with &s;o much avidity from nothing.</P>
<P>I freely acknowledge, however, that the natural eagerne&s;s of my temper may have led me to expre&s;s my&s;elf with an energy which was perhaps ab&s;urd enough; but I am accu&s;tomed, to <HI>my</HI> Sophia, <HI>to think on paper</HI>; I give every idea full la|titude, and never once reflect how ridi|culous I may often appear.</P>
<P>You command me, you &s;ay, on my <HI>allegiance,</HI> to confe&s;s faithfully if I do not find my&s;elf inclined to be a little more &s;olicitous about this Oroondates than I ever was about the Chevalier de Mer|tane, or any other man? Indeed, my
<PB N="73" REF="74">
dear, this is by no means putting the matter to a fair trial; for to compare Mr. Roat&s;ley with the Chevalier argues nothing in the world in favour of your opinion, the latter being determinedly di&s;agreeable to me; and there is a ma|terial difference I hope between acknow|ledging that a man is agreeable and be|ing in love with him. That I think Mr. Roat&s;ley the mo&s;t agreeable man I have yet met with, I &s;incerely confe&s;s; but I can think him &s;o, and even in|dulge a wi&s;h for further intimacy, with|out concluding my&s;elf in the &s;lighte&s;t danger.</P>
<P>I will confe&s;s to you, however, my &s;weet friend, and let the openne&s;s of my heart put a final period to your raillery on this &s;ubject, that &s;ince the night of the play, when I think I mu&s;t have given him cau&s;e for thinking meanly of me, I have &s;uffered more unea&s;ine&s;s than &s;uch a trifle ought to have occa&s;ioned; and the
<PB N="74" REF="75">
recollection that this change in his beha|viour was antecedent to Farnford's ap|pearance in the party, adds to my per|plexity and encrea&s;es my regret.</P>
<P>As he appears to be intimate with Captain Brad&s;haw, perhaps the latter has hinted &s;u&s;picions of my prudence and thus overturned the favourable &s;enti|ments which at Dover Roat&s;ley &s;eemed inclined to feel for his new acquaint|ances; yet his polite and attentive be|haviour when I met with him at Drury-lane Theatre, entirely contradicts this idea, and was indeed totally different from the cold di&s;tance and civil re&s;erve with which his manner was impre&s;&s;ed the la&s;t time I &s;aw him at the theatre. He did not appear the &s;ame man, at lea&s;t he certainly was not actuated by the &s;ame feelings.</P>
<P>This confe&s;&s;ion may lead you to &s;u&s;|pect the weakne&s;s of my heart, and I have &s;everely condemned my&s;elf for al|lowing
<PB N="75" REF="76">
the opinion of a &s;tranger to in|fluence me &s;o far: yet I really believe pride alone is at the bottom of my un|ea&s;ine&s;s. I am hurt to have fallen in the e&s;teem of a man, who, in &s;pite of your raillery, appears &s;uperior to mo&s;t of his &s;ex. I formed no wi&s;hes from his acquaintance, but that he might prove an agreeable acqui&s;ition to our &s;ociety; therefore I could experience, I imagined, but a &s;light di&s;appointment. Yet I al|low that I have permitted his behaviour to intere&s;t me too much; and &s;ince it has been &s;o remarkable as to excite your ob&s;ervation even &s;o early, I give you my word I will exert my&s;elf to think of it no more.</P>

<P>Mrs. Hindon, though far &s;hort of my &s;anguine expectations, is a well-meaning woman, and by no means deficient in &s;everal good qualities. The&s;e are in|deed often ob&s;cured by the want of one which be&s;tows lu&s;tre on every other, I mean <HI>delicacy.</HI> She would not willingly inflict a wound, if &s;he was con&s;cious of its poignancy; but &s;he is totally de&s;ti|tute of tho&s;e feelings which tell when anothers are hurt. Without being ge|nerous, &s;he does not fail in point of charity; I mean that branch of the duty that con&s;i&s;ts in giving alms. She keeps excellent order in her family, piques her&s;elf upon being an active oeconomi&s;t,
<PB N="78" REF="79">
goes &s;eldom into public, and is not given to di&s;&s;ipation. Our hours are early and regular, at lea&s;t when compared with tho&s;e which prevail in this country, and our evenings are generally &s;pent at home, where now and then an ea&s;y friend joins the family party.</P>
<P>I have di&s;covered one &s;triking fea|ture in Mrs. Hindon's character, to which perhaps may be attributed her unbounded civility to us. Yet I own it is unfair to place her kindne&s;s in a light that de|prives it of all its merit. She was her|&s;elf of very low extraction, and probably for that rea&s;on has attached an idea of importance to rank and family, which induces her to attend with the mo&s;t &s;edu|lous regard and re&s;pect to all who have the &s;lighte&s;t claim to di&s;tinction. Since our abode here, I have &s;u&s;pected a &s;cheme, which repeated ob&s;ervation now convinces me is not without foundation. Captain Wilmot, Mrs. Hindon's nephew,
<PB N="79" REF="80">
in a manner lives in her hou&s;e; and ex|cept at the &s;ea&s;ons of &s;leeping or dre&s;&s;ing, makes con&s;tantly one of the family. He is become of late extremely particular in his attentions to Fanny, and conti|nually entertains her in a &s;ort of half whi&s;per, which gives their conver&s;ation the air of a <HI>tete &agrave; tete.</HI> He is good-looking, though extremely vacant and in&s;ipid; but having received the poli&s;h of a military education, is enabled to hold forth with ea&s;e and fluency in a complimentary &s;tyle to which Fanny has no &s;ort of aver&s;ion. I have been a good deal alarmed, le&s;t, as &s;he is young and completely inexperienced, <HI>les petits &s;oins de Mon&s;ieur le Capitaine,</HI> &s;hould prove more &s;ucce&s;sful than were to be wi&s;hed. I have not failed therefore, in talking of him in private, to throw a degree of ridicule upon his behaviour and appear|ance, of all weapons the mo&s;t dangerous again&s;t which a lover can contend, and
<PB N="80" REF="81">
as Fanny is not extremely &s;u&s;ceptible, I think my plan will prove the de&s;truction of Mrs. Hindon's; for that &s;he is at the bottom of the Captain's pa&s;&s;ion, and has be&s;towed the proper &s;upplies of fuel to blow it into a flame, I have no manner of doubt. Indeed her de&s;ire of aggran|dizing her family by an alliance with Lord Belmont's, might alone have in|duced her to promote a match between Fanny and her nephew; but I make no doubt that be&s;ides this motive, to a young man who is not in affluent circum&s;tances, Fanny's ten thou&s;and pounds, added to the expectations which Mrs. Hindon often in&s;inuates we may ju&s;tly form from our grand father's liberality, would be an addition extremely de&s;irable. After all, he may be &s;incerely enamoured, for Fanny po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es charms capable of in|tere&s;ting more refined &s;entiments than I &s;u&s;pect the Captain to po&s;&s;e&s;s; yet I re|collect we were &s;ome time here before he &s;eemed to know &s;he was even in the &s;ame
<PB N="81" REF="82">
room with him, and his &s;olicitude took its ri&s;e all of a &s;udden, without any ap|parent cau&s;e for the alteration, after an appearance of the mo&s;t frigid indiffer|ence.</P>
<P>My &s;u&s;picions that the &s;cheme was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to him by his aunt, have been confirmed from remarking that Mrs. Hindon takes every opportunity of la|vi&s;hing the mo&s;t exaggerated encomiums on her nephew. He is the very be&s;t young man in the world; given to no vice; always kept him&s;elf out of the mad frolics of his military companions; and &s;o good a &s;on, that &s;he made no doubt he would make a figure equally re&s;pec|table in every other department of life.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, don't you think him extremely hand&s;ome, Mi&s;s Fanny? I'm &s;ure if you had been within hearing of what he &s;aid of you la&s;t night, you mu&s;t have been flattered, though there was not one word of flattery in the ca&s;e. He de|clared
<PB N="82" REF="83">
you was in his opinion&mdash;you mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Mi&s;s Seymour&mdash;by far the hand&s;ome&s;t of the two, and &s;o amiable, and &s;o elegant, and &s;o like a young lady of the fir&s;t quality. However I give you my word, Mi&s;s Seymour, he allows you to be what all the world mu&s;t ac|knowledge&mdash;compleatly lovely; but Mi&s;s Fanny, he &s;ays, is an angel, and I think he is fairly caught at la&s;t.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear, by this little trait, that Mrs. Hindon, with all her errors, is not in the lea&s;t artful. Indeed I be|lieve this plan no &s;ooner occurred to her|&s;elf, than, though without intending it, &s;he contrived to communicate it to me. She is indeed incapable even of a pru|dent concealment; and when &s;he ima|gines her de&s;igns (for &s;he has a very active turn of mind) are cunningly hidden from every eye, a &s;light degree of penetration only is required to pierce through the thin di&s;gui&s;e. She does not &s;pare flat|tery
<PB N="83" REF="84">
you may perceive on this occa&s;ion; and as &s;he knows the influence which two years &s;eniority, added to the warme&s;t attachment, have given me over Fanny's mind, you &s;ee I get my &s;hare of it, as a per&s;on whom it is nece&s;&s;ary to bring over to her intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I think Mr. Howard has likewi&s;e made a di&s;covery of the &s;cheme, which evi|dently meets with his di&s;approbation; for he always appears chagrined and di&s;|plea&s;ed when Wilmot joins us, and re|gards him with a &s;crutinizing eye when he whi&s;pers &s;oft non&s;en&s;e into Fanny's ear.</P>
<P>Indeed to a mind like his, &s;o fraught with rectitude and good &s;en&s;e, the utter impropriety of &s;uch a &s;tep mu&s;t appear in full force; and I make no doubt that con&s;idering him&s;elf at pre&s;ent in the light of our guardian, he holds him&s;elf re|&s;pon&s;ible to Lord Belmont for our con|duct. While under his immediate, his &s;ole direction, were this affair to involve
<PB N="84" REF="85">
Fanny in a marriage &s;o imprudent, it mu&s;t reflect extremely even on Mr. How|ard's character; &s;ince from his connection with Wilmot, it would undoubtedly ap|pear to Lord Belmont as having received his &s;ecret concurrence and approbation.</P>
<P>Of &s;uch a conduct, I am convinced Mr. Howard is incapable, even were he to draw from the event the mo&s;t de&s;ira|ble con&s;equenses to him&s;elf: but inde|pendent of this idea, I am mi&s;taken if a more forcible motive does not give ad|ditional weight to the repugnance with which he beholds Wilmot's a&s;&s;iduities.</P>
<P>I believe I once hinted to you, that Mr. Howard, during the infancy of our acquaintance, was extremely particular in his attentions to me. He was ever &s;olicitous for my company, and &s;ought my conver&s;ation with eagerne&s;s and &s;e|dulity. His behaviour at length alarmed me, and mine plainly told him how un|&s;ucce&s;sful any application beyond the
<PB N="85" REF="86">
limits of friend&s;hip would prove; for though I e&s;teem, I admire his merits, and there is none of his &s;ex for who&s;e character I have a higher re&s;pect; though his manners be&s;peak his mind, and con|vey the mild benevolence of his nature into every look and motion; and though his years would not have been with me a material objection, yet, yet, Sophia, I could not have loved him. You will call me romantic perhaps; but never could Mr. Howard have enjoyed that tender intere&s;t in my heart which my lover mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s ere he becomes my hu&s;band. My &s;entiments partake of tho&s;e a daughter feels for her parent. They are tho&s;e of confidence, depend|ence, and gratitude; but they are far removed from tho&s;e &s;oft, cordial, and in&s;inuating ties which make the duties of a wife her fir&s;t happine&s;s, and enable her almo&s;t to exi&s;t but for the man to whom &s;he has given her hand.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">When Fanny returned from the con|vent, (for it was during her abode there that our acquaintance with Mr. Howard commenced) he was &s;truck with her ap|pearance: but he regarded her as a beau|tiful child, and was more delighted with her <HI>naivet&egrave;</HI> than her conver&s;ation; and though he often entered into chat, he never di&s;cour&s;ed with her: till our mis|fortune in lo&s;ing our dear parent, by throwing us entirely under his care, made him feel Fanny's dependence, which at the period of my illne&s;s re&s;ted &s;olely on him, as a peculiar charm that &s;eemed to &s;often and affect him.</P>
<P>While we travelled, &s;he leant on him for &s;upport in every difficulty or alarm. To him every enquiry was made, and from him every explanation was expected; and there are few men, I believe, in whom the idea of protection, exerted to|wards a young and plea&s;ing object, will not create a tender intere&s;t, which if it
<PB N="87" REF="88">
is not love, partakes extremely of the &s;ame &s;entiment.</P>
<P>As for me, my &s;pirits oppre&s;&s;ed and my temper independent, I tru&s;ted a little more to my&s;elf, nor con&s;ulted Mr. How|ard but when circum&s;tances called for coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To me therefore he ever behaves with re&s;pect and the mo&s;t flattering regard; but to Fanny, his ad|dre&s;s has &s;till more &s;oftne&s;s; he appears as if he con&s;idered her peculiarly his charge, and to gratify her in any little wi&s;h, however whim&s;ical, evidently con|fers plea&s;ure on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet if my &s;u&s;picions of his &s;ecret par|tiality are founded on truth, (for I will not pretend to be certain whether my &s;urmizes are not partly the chimeras of my own imagination) he is acting on this occa&s;ion like a man of honour, and as I &s;hould have expected from his cha|racter. His attentions are tho&s;e which may be felt, but except by my&s;elf, I am
<PB N="88" REF="89">
certain never have been remarked; nor has he once betrayed a wi&s;h to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into her good graces. No doubt he is con&s;cious that a man of moderate fortune cannot be con&s;idered by Lord Belmont as a match for his grand child; who, if he means to acknowledge her, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a variety of advantages, ac|cording to the world's opinion, &s;ufficient to carry a grandfather's views infinitely higher; neither is he in&s;en&s;ible, I dare &s;ay, to the inequality of their years.</P>
<P>A girl of &s;ixteen, with all the thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s incident to her time of life, en|crea&s;ed perhaps by the retirement of her education, cannot appear to &s;ober rea&s;on an elligible choice for a grave, &s;edate man of forty three, who&s;e pro&s;pects of happine&s;s have probably been centered in expecting an amiable companion rather than a beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, in the woman whom he makes the partner of his life. Yet probably tho&s;e very men, Sophia,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
may not prove le&s;s liable than others to be caught by the charms of youth; and when that is the ca&s;e, partiality no doubt per&s;uades them they have di&s;covered the mi&s;tre&s;s and companion in one, and that they may be able to mould a young and innocent mind as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I am mi&s;taken if Mr. Howard's ima|gination has not &s;ometimes &s;ecretly &s;ug|ge&s;ted &s;ome &s;uch ideas; though further than concealed wi&s;hes, I am confident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey never will proceed.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JANUARY 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS interval of &s;ome days has pro|duced occurrences of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing nature. Oh! my Sophia, why was I ever prevailed on to quit our quiet retreat in Languedoc? why has fate condemned me to vi&s;it a country, where, &s;ince the moment of my arrival, I have encoun|tered only di&s;appointments, again&s;t which I mu&s;t &s;truggle, and difficulties with which I mu&s;t contend.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning Mrs. Hindon pro|po&s;ed carrying us to the &s;ale of a noble|man's furniture and effects, who had lately
<PB N="91" REF="92">
ruined him&s;elf by extravagance and a fatal pa&s;&s;ion for play. Curio&s;ity, &s;he told us, had brought the whole town together on this occa&s;ion: numbers, who never thought of becoming purcha&s;ers flocking to the auction to behold the &s;plendor and elegance of the articles expo&s;ed to view.</P>
<P>This not being an amu&s;ement for which I imagined I &s;hould have much reli&s;h, I declined being of the party; and &s;oon after Fanny and &s;he were gone, Mrs. Weldon called. She was &s;o extremely agreeable, and made &s;o many apologies for the behaviour of her&s;elf and company the evening I &s;pent at her hou&s;e, that I could not help cordially forgiving, tho' in my heart I could not thoroughly excu&s;e her.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t con&s;ider my dear, &s;aid &s;he, that your ideas and mine on certain points cannot fail to be extremely oppo&s;ite. You have been educated in ab&s;olute &s;oli|tude, and mu&s;t have taken your opinions
<PB N="92" REF="93">
either from reading, which is a very er|roneous guide to form your &s;entiments upon, and one that ever leads to narrow prejudices and contracted notions, or have imbibed your rules of manners from the conver&s;ation of your father, who lived in the la&s;t age, at lea&s;t in times that did not allow of tho&s;e freedoms that the pre&s;ent fully authorize. As for me, be&s;ides the &s;anction which matrimony at a very early period of life gave to the natural gaiety of my temper, I have &s;een a good deal of the world; my character therefore is e&s;tabli&s;hed. I fear not the voice of cen|&s;ure; and tho&s;e gentlemen who&s;e mirth offended you &s;o much, were men I have long known; two of them were my re|lations; and you mu&s;t allow that in the mid&s;t of their life and &s;pirit no real im|propriety was thought of.</P>
<P>Though I did not exactly agree in this opinion, I allowed it to pa&s;s without en|deavouring to confute it; and after &s;it|ting
<PB N="93" REF="94">
an hour, during which Mrs. Wel|don conver&s;ed &s;o rationally and agreeably that &s;he made me entirely forget my re|&s;entment, &s;he took leave, being engaged &s;he &s;aid with her lawyers at a certain hour; having fir&s;t made me promi&s;e to dine with her two days hence, when &s;he a&s;&s;ured me there &s;hould be no company except a female relation, with whom &s;he was certain I &s;hould be much plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Weldon's company is at all times really delightful, for &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the art of rendering the mo&s;t trifling oc|currences intere&s;ting from the in&s;inuat|ing gaiety with which &s;he relates them, I con&s;ented; having fir&s;t confe&s;&s;ed that I hoped none of the gentlemen of her la&s;t party would join us. If any of them call, cried &s;he laughing, I promi&s;e you I &s;hall give orders to be denied, &s;ince the pretty little prude will have it &s;o.</P>
<P>After &s;he was gone, having a little time to my&s;elf, which is not often the
<PB N="94" REF="95">
ca&s;e, I recollected that I had &s;ome trif|ling bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act with Mrs. Brump|ton, my late landlady, relating to part of our baggage, which &s;till remained at her hou&s;e; and as I wi&s;hed to make Mrs. Hindon a trifling pre&s;ent of a very pretty work box which was packed in one of the trunks under Mrs. Brumpton's care, I &s;ent Dubois acro&s;s the &s;quare, for it is not much further, to a&s;k if &s;he was at home, and to let her know I &s;hould call &s;ome time that morning to &s;peak with her; and half an hour after I ordered my chair and went.</P>
<P>The maid conducted me into a &s;mall parlour, &s;aying indi&s;pen&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s had carried her mi&s;tre&s;s out for a few mo|ments, but that &s;he had left orders if I came to beg the favour of me to wait her return. I confe&s;s I thought this rather a freedom in the woman; however I &s;at down, expecting &s;he would &s;oon appear.</P>
<P>My attention was in a &s;hort time
<PB N="95" REF="96">
rou&s;ed by hearing a gentleman give or|ders to his &s;ervant, &s;o near, that I found only a thin partition &s;eparated the room in which I was placed from that occu|pied by our late fellow lodger, Captain Brad&s;haw. He appeared employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the packing of &s;ome guns, and other &s;hooting implements, about which he &s;eemed as anxiou&s;ly careful as if his life had depended on their arriving un|damaged at the end of their de&s;tined journey. He was extremely bu&s;y, and whi&s;tled with great vociferation &s;everal little cotillion tunes at pre&s;ent in vogue.</P>
<P>Some time after I heard the door of his apartment open, and a gentleman en|ter.&mdash;Well Tom, cried a voice which I in&s;tantly knew to be Mr. Roat&s;ley's, you are preparing to be gone I find.</P>
<P>Yes, I am &s;ending off all my &s;hooting apparatus, in hopes that &s;ince I mu&s;t go I may find &s;ome amu&s;ement in making havock among the partridges. I am told
<PB N="96" REF="97">
there is excellent &s;port on Sir Edward's grounds; and I may as well take ten days of it as not.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t quantity of game about that part of the country, an&s;wered Mr. Roat&s;ley. Perhaps I may take it into my head to pay you a vi&s;it at your quar|ters, after my election bu&s;ine&s;s is con|cluded.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to God you would. But for my own part the devil take me if any thing under heaven &s;hould drive me from town at this &s;ea&s;on, while I had a full pur&s;e, and leave from the regiment to &s;pend it where I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Heaven knows what my feelings by that time may be, &s;aid the other, but at pre&s;ent I find my&s;elf equally incapable of reli&s;hing the plea&s;ures of the town or the amu&s;ements of the country.</P>
<P>Yes you are fairly caught at la&s;t, cried Brad&s;haw, laughing heartily: Cupid has revenged him&s;elf with a vengeance; and
<PB N="97" REF="98">
you know I always told you he would one day prove doubly &s;evere. She is divinely hand&s;ome it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, and I believe the little god never aimed his darts from brighter eyes than tho&s;e of your Dulcinea. They would alone con|&s;titute a beauty without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other perfect feature.</P>
<P>There is at lea&s;t, replied his friend, a character&mdash;an expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;a &s;omething about her altogether that intere&s;ts me beyond what any other woman was ever capable of effecting.</P>
<P>A character! replied the other re|doubling his mirth. But indeed we have always been told that love is blind.</P>
<P>Think, my deare&s;t Sophia, if your &s;u&s;|picions had any real foundation, and much I fear there was more cau&s;e in your raillery than I ever dreaded, think what I felt at this in&s;tant. From the time of Roat&s;ley's entering, I had &s;uf|fered agitation un&s;peakable, and had li&s;|tened
<PB N="98" REF="99">
with eager anxiety to this di&s;cour&s;e; but at the la&s;t &s;entence my heart beat with augmented violence, and I waited with inexpre&s;&s;ible impatience to learn the name of that happy woman whom at this painful moment I &s;crupled not to confe&s;s I envied. Breathle&s;s with expectation, I heard Mr. Roat&s;ley after a &s;hort pau&s;e reply&mdash;Well, Brad&s;haw, in &s;pite of ap|pearances, which I acknowledge are by no means in her favour, I cannot for my &s;oul think of her for an in&s;tant in a di&s;re|&s;pectful point of view. When I reflect on her behaviour during the &s;hort period of our acquaintance, it &s;eemed to evince a &s;uperior turn of mind; far from giving way to her fears in a &s;torm which might ju&s;tly have excu&s;ed the mo&s;t immoderate and well grounded apprehen&s;ions, &s;he ex|erted her&s;elf in the mo&s;t amiable manner to calm and allay the weaker terrors of her &s;i&s;ter, who &s;unk under her alarm; ince&s;&s;antly endeavouring to in&s;pire that
<PB N="99" REF="100">
hope and con&s;olation which &s;he her&s;elf equally required at a moment &s;o tremen|dous. Struck with her uncommon beauty, I took advantage of her &s;ituation to offer her tho&s;e little attentions which any woman in &s;imilar circum&s;tances would have claimed from me, but which in performing to this unknown fair, gra|tified me beyond expre&s;&s;ion. Her fears, &s;o unaffected, &s;o &s;evere, yet &s;o little in|dulged, rendered her at once the object of my admiration and tendered compa&s;|&s;ion. There were a thou&s;and charms in every word, in every look; and a certain &s;light degree of a foreign accent, which in another might have appeared a defect, gave a peculiar &s;oftne&s;s to the tone of her voice, the force of which I felt without being able to define it.</P>
<P>The alarming &s;ituation in which I be|held her, gave birth to a thou&s;and cir|cum&s;tances that all con&s;pired to delight and intere&s;t me. Nor did the evening I
<PB N="100" REF="101">
&s;pent in her company at Dover, fail to heighten and augment my fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions in her favour. Her manner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a poli&s;hed &s;implicity, and her conver&s;a|tion a refined good &s;en&s;e, which diffu&s;ed a mutual lu&s;tre on each other, and which in&s;inuated her into my heart beyond all power of re&s;i&s;tance; and although I was obliged to get to the Abbey by the day I had mentioned to my mother, and had hardly time &s;ufficient to fulfil my pro|mi&s;e, yet I allowed many hours to elap&s;e before I could prevail with my&s;elf to quit the inn where the lovely Mi&s;s Seymour was.</P>
<P>Is it then <HI>me</HI> at la&s;t&mdash;<HI>me</HI> indeed&mdash;cried I to my&s;elf, out of breath with expecta|tion and wholly exhau&s;ted with agitation.</P>
<P>During the preceding &s;peech, it is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe what were my perturba|tions. At one time elated with hopes, which at another &s;unk into apprehen|&s;ions, I feared to flatter my&s;elf delu&s;ively;
<PB N="101" REF="102">
nor till I heard my name di&s;tinctly pro|nounced could I be per&s;uaded that the woman he had been de&s;cribing with all the exaggerated encomiums of an impa&s;|&s;ioned heart, could indeed be my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure which ru&s;hed into my mind, were &s;oon however mixed with a bitterne&s;s that poi&s;oned every ri|&s;ing &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>When I call to mind her behaviour, continued he, both during that evening and every &s;ucceeding one when I have been &s;o fortunate as to conver&s;e with her; when I recollect her manner, &s;o &s;oft, &s;o unaffected, &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly engaging, how is it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile all this with the account which the woman here gives of the whole party. I cannot recollect one in&s;tance of the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of le|vity either in Mi&s;s Seymour or her &s;i&s;ter, who is the very picture of innocence it|&s;elf, nor would it have been in the power of any per&s;on on earth to have made me
<PB N="102" REF="103">
for one in&s;tant give credit to the a&s;per|&s;ion on her character, had not my eyes witne&s;&s;ed that &s;he can forgive an in&s;ult which a delicate woman never could have pardoned.</P>
<P>After all, &s;aid Captain Brad&s;haw, Mrs. Brumpton does not ab&s;olutely aver that they are abandoned girls, though it mu&s;t be owned &s;he &s;eems to in&s;inuate more than &s;he chu&s;es to divulge; and la&s;t night when I que&s;tioned her again according to your de&s;ire, &s;he told me that when under the eye of their Argus, no girls can be|have with greater propriety, but that the in&s;tant his back is turned they do not appear the &s;ame creatures.</P>
<P>What I at this moment heard affected me &s;o violently that I became incapable for &s;ome minutes of at ending to what they &s;aid; on renewing my attention I found Roat&s;ley was &s;peaking.</P>
<P>You may conclude then, &s;aid he, how &s;hocked I mu&s;t be to learn that there were
<PB N="103" REF="104">
a variety of rumours to the di&s;advantage of this family, with which I was &s;o much charmed. I was indeed inexpre&s;&s;ibly hurt to find any mortal dared to think di&s;re&s;pectfully of any one of them; yet I di&s;believed every &s;yllable that was ut|tered. I could not di&s;credit the evidence of my eyes, which traced every amiable quality and every &s;entiment of female dignity in the countenance and manner of Mi&s;s Seymour. As for her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he is al&s;o very lovely, and the innocent youthfulne&s;s of her appearance accords ill with your report. Mr. Howard I have enquired after; and find he is e&s;teemed a man of &s;en&s;e and character, neither given to vice nor even accu&s;ed of exce&s;s; I mu&s;t therefore repeat, that I think the notion of their being his wards is infinitely more probable (even &s;etting a&s;ide the ap|pearance of the ladies, which indeed ren|ders any other opinion ab&s;olutely impo&s;|&s;ible,) than that there &s;hould be any
<PB N="104" REF="105">
illicit connection in the ca&s;e. That part of the &s;tory I am therefore thoroughly convinced is an infamous &s;lander.</P>
<P>Wounded to the &s;oul by this dreadful, this inconceivable explanation of the mo|tives of Mr. Roat&s;ley's late behaviour, oh! Sophia, what were my pangs, what was my mortification, during a recital which &s;unk my &s;pirits from the highe&s;t elevation to the lowe&s;t de&s;pondency. Scarce could I keep my&s;elf from faint|ing at the cruel and painful conclu&s;ion of encomiums which had excited &s;uch infi|nite pride and plea&s;ure. My heart died within me; yet I anxiou&s;ly li&s;tened to what &s;hould follow, while my eyes were drowned in tears of vexation and regret.</P>
<P>The girl may be thoughtle&s;s and in|con&s;iderate, returned Brad&s;haw, without being ab&s;olutely void of delicacy; and their being with Lady Farnford certainly argues in favour of their reputation. The idea of their being French courte|zans
<PB N="105" REF="106">
is not by any means probable: but &s;hould they turn out &s;o you have &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to &s;igh Roat&s;ley, for your fair one will not prove cruel.</P>
<P>It is utterly impo&s;&s;ible! cried Roat&s;ley with warmth. I am perfectly convinced of the abominable fal&s;hood of that in&s;i|nuation. Mi&s;s Seymour may be weak, vain, and volatile, (though even in the&s;e points I am unconvinced,) for I will not pretend to aver that fir&s;t &s;ight impre&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially where an intere&s;ting figure is in que&s;tion, are always to be taken as proof; but to attack her moral character is an a&s;per&s;ion which one look mu&s;t compleatly and &s;ufficiently confute. I own I am hurt and confounded at the variety of reports which pour in upon me from more quarters than one: they have even reached the ears of my mother, though &s;he never &s;aw either of them in her life, nor could have heard even their names repeated till within the&s;e few days. Mi&s;s
<PB N="106" REF="107">
Seymour has fallen I acknowledge from the high ideas I had conceived of her character, but never for an in&s;tant can I do her &s;o material an injury as to &s;u&s;pect her reputation.</P>
<P>There are men, &s;aid Mr. Brad&s;haw, who in your &s;ituation would not regret if that point continued doubtful.</P>
<P>No, cried his friend, the woman who has once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of in&s;piring me with a pa&s;&s;ion [almo&s;t equally com|pounded of tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem, can|not pre&s;erve the fir&s;t while &s;he lo&s;es all claim to the latter. My love for Mi&s;s Seymour could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t independent of that delicacy which gives it a charm refined and inexpre&s;&s;ible; nor would I enjoy if I might the fruits of a fall which I &s;hould ever lament. But I am con|&s;cious I am injuring her in mentioning her name under &s;uch a &s;urmi&s;e. Pray what &s;ays your watch? This &s;ubject car|ries me too far; and I have an engage|ment at four.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">'Tis almo&s;t that hour, cried the other; and both the gentlemen ro&s;e to go.</P>
<P>I trembled from head to foot as they pa&s;&s;ed the door of the parlour, le&s;t any accident &s;hould have di&s;covered me; but I was &s;oon rid of my fears as they left the hou&s;e directly.</P>
<P>What do you think, my dear Sophia, of this conver&s;ation, &s;o wholly incon|ceivable? Scarce have I pre&s;erved re&s;o|lution and patience &s;ufficient for relating it minutely, without often interrupting my narration by the &s;ilent ejaculations and the different emotions to which at the time it gave ri&s;e. To delineate my various feelings of mortification, di&s;dain and vexation, would be perfectly impo&s;|&s;ible. I think however you may in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ugge&s;t to your&s;elf what they mu&s;t have been. Terror was no incon|&s;iderable ingredient towards rendering the &s;ituation of my mind &s;till more dread|ful; and what motive Mrs. Brumpton
<PB N="108" REF="109">
could po&s;&s;ibly have had for repre&s;enting us to others in a light in which I am cer|tain &s;he never could her&s;elf have regarded us, plunged me into con&s;ternation and affright.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant Mr. Roat&s;ley and his friend were out of the hou&s;e, I deter|mined to fly from a &s;pot in which I dreaded one moment longer to remain; and was ha&s;tening to the door, when it &s;uddenly opened, and Mrs. Brumpton appeared, quite out of breath, followed by&mdash;the wretch Farnford.</P>
<P>Ten thou&s;and pardons Madam, cried &s;he, for the trouble you have had in wait|ing. A poor &s;ick relation &s;ent to intreat I would give her the con&s;olation of one half hour's conver&s;ation, having &s;ome af|fairs to impart which lay heavy on her mind, and thinking as you mentioned two o'clock that you would not be here for &s;ome time, I ventured to give my poor dying cou&s;in the comfort &s;he &s;o much required.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">While &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, in a whining hypocritical tone, Farnford ad|vanced, and making me a profound bow, endeavoured to convey a look of contri|tion and reverence into his countenance, as if he concluded it mu&s;t at once molify and &s;ubdue my re&s;entment: but I en|tirely di&s;regarded his &s;alutation. The &s;ight of him &s;o unexpectedly threw me in|to the utmo&s;t terror, and a crowd of con|fu&s;ed apprehen&s;ions ru&s;hed in&s;tantly on my mind. I exerted my&s;elf however to a&s;&s;ume an appearance of unconcerned in|difference.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry Madam, &s;aid I, with an air of gravity and compo&s;ure under which I &s;trove to conceal the fears which almo&s;t overpowered me, that you &s;hould have been &s;o unluckily from home, as I have an indi&s;pen&s;ible engagement that prevents my remaining a moment longer. I &s;hall &s;ettle matters at a more convenient time; at pre&s;ent it is impo&s;&s;ible; and I walked
<PB N="110" REF="111">
compo&s;edly towards the door, which &s;he had &s;hut.</P>
<P>The woman &s;eemed at a lo&s;s, and &s;tam|mered out&mdash;'Tis really extremely un|lucky indeed Ma'am: but if you could ju&s;t &s;it down a little bit Ma'am&mdash;perhaps you might find time to give me directions about that large trunk, Ma'am&mdash;which has remained in my back room ever &s;ince you quitted it. Would you choo&s;e that it &s;hould remain in my cu&s;tody, where it is very &s;afe, or &s;hall it be &s;ent to Mrs. Hindon's in the Square Ma'am.</P>
<P>All this time &s;he kept her hand on the lock of the door, as if &s;he intended me the civility of opening it, but evidently with the de&s;ign of detaining me. This movement redoubled my emotions; yet I an&s;wered as coolly as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;Let it be &s;ent to Mrs. Hindon's Madam; but I am in extreme ha&s;te, and beg I may not be detained.</P>
<P>For heaven's &s;ake, cried Farnford, who
<PB N="111" REF="112">
all this while &s;tood in evident embarra&s;&s;|ment, his eyes fixed with a mo&s;t impu|dent &s;tare on my face&mdash;Spare a few mo|ments I be&s;eech you from your engage|ment, and permit an unhappy man, who has unde&s;ignedly and unfortunately of|fended you, to plead his cau&s;e at your feet; and falling on his knees, he &s;eized my hand, which all my endeavours could not wre&s;t from him. But indeed I was too much intimidated to dare to make much re&s;i&s;tance; for the woman &s;till held the door; and though con&s;cious that I was in fact a pri&s;oner, I was anxious to keep mea&s;ures with them as long as po&s;|&s;ible, which I imagined might pre&s;erve me from indignity.</P>
<P>Only hear me for one moment, conti|nued he, and you will be con&s;cious that you have no ju&s;t cau&s;e for offence. The fir&s;t glance I had of &s;uch &s;uperlative charms, compleated the conque&s;t of my heart: a heart, which has long remained
<PB N="112" REF="113">
unmoved, un&s;ubdued, by the attractions of the mo&s;t amiable and mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed of your &s;ex&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, cried I, interrupting him with a re&s;olution which pride and re&s;entment in|&s;pired, it is perfectly immaterial to me what are your &s;entiments. I am not at lei&s;ure at pre&s;ent to li&s;ten to your di&s;|cour&s;e, and I de&s;ire you would in&s;tantly relea&s;e me.</P>
<P>The whole world and all the powers it contains, cried he with frightful vehe|mence, &s;hall not tear you from me till you have heard me out. I own I did you inju&s;tice. I heartily deplore it. What can I &s;ay more? What can I do more to te&s;tify to you the &s;incerity of my regret and repentance? Undoubtedly the mo&s;t confounded prudery can alone induce you &s;o violently to re&s;ent a free|dom of behaviour into which intoxication and a fal&s;e idea of your character inad|vertently led me. The moment I di&s;co|vered
<PB N="113" REF="114">
my error I &s;hould have flown to have acknowledged and renounced it at your feet, but you have con&s;tantly fru&s;|trated all my attempts to obtain an in|terview. I am therefore con&s;trained to make the mo&s;t of fortune, and &s;ince &s;he has at length propitiou&s;ly favoured my wi&s;hes, how can you imagine I will not take advantage of her gifts. Angelic creature, continued he, for heaven's &s;ake hear me with &s;ome degree of &s;oftne&s;s and pity. I adore you: I would with delight undergo the &s;evere&s;ts torments to gain the &s;lighte&s;t hopes of forgivene&s;s. Tell me only that you will forget a conduct which I heartily lament&mdash;tell me that you will admit of my vi&s;its at Mrs. Hin|don's, where all the family are favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards me&mdash;and I will torture my own &s;oul by permitting you to leave me.</P>
<P>I will not grant a permi&s;&s;ion, cried I with &s;pirit, which would lead to a per&s;e|cution
<PB N="114" REF="115">
I never will undergo and to hopes I never will encourage. You vainly flat|ter your&s;elf, Sir, if you imagine you will even extort &s;uch a con&s;ent. I de&s;ire you will allow me to go. I in&s;i&s;t upon it. What title have you to pre&s;ume to detain me again&s;t my inclination, (and I &s;poke with undi&s;&s;embled heat) you will oblige me to call up my footman for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>He is not within call, I give you my word, &s;o <HI>that</HI> is a re&s;ource to which you cannot apply.</P>
<P>Pray Mrs. Brumpton, cried I to the wicked woman, do you allow of &s;uch violence being practi&s;ed in your hou&s;e?</P>
<P>All the Captain a&s;ks is forgivene&s;s, Madam, replied &s;he. Were he to at|tempt any incivility, I &s;hould be the fir&s;t to condemn him. I never have counte|nanced &s;uch proceedings in my hou&s;e I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am; but all the gentle|man a&s;ks is to be allowed to hope.</P>
<P>All I wi&s;h by G&mdash;, interrupted he,

all I kneel for is, that you would forget what has di&s;plea&s;ed you in my conduct, and by admitting my vi&s;its, flatter me with the hope that time and a&s;&s;iduity may &s;often that dear, that inflexible heart in my favour.</P>
<P>Never, never, cried I with firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Never! Madam, an&s;wered he, &s;ud|denly throwing a&s;ide that appearance of humility and re&s;pect which notwith&s;tand|ing his violence he had hitherto pre|&s;erved, and a&s;&s;uming a look that terri|fied me&mdash;Do you per&s;i&s;t in this deter|mination? do you tell me <HI>never</HI> to hope for pardon, Madam? Since then I find I gain no ground by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;ince you continue thus re&s;olute and unmoved to all my entreaties, &s;ince all my pro|te&s;tations only feed a pride, &s;tern and un|relenting, permit me to a&s;&s;ure you, that if you do not conde&s;cend to grant me &s;ome chance for future favour, mo&s;t cer|tainly I &s;hall not prove &s;o much my own

enemy as&mdash;as to allow you to leave me, &s;aid he he&s;itating&mdash;without obtaining it.</P>
<P>What do you a&s;k, &s;aid I, almo&s;t &s;ink|ing with terror from the alarming warmth with which he uttered the&s;e words, and from the wildne&s;s of his looks, while he not only gra&s;ped my hand but ki&s;&s;ed it &s;everal times in a pa&s;&s;ionate manner.</P>
<P>I only de&s;ire, replied he, that you will never mention to any per&s;on whatever this interview, that you will endeavour to forget I ever offended you, and that you will deign to allow of my vi&s;its, nor &s;crupulou&s;ly avoid my &s;ight, under tho&s;e fal&s;e pretences of engagements and in|di&s;po&s;ition which have hitherto baffled all my attempts to meet with you.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, cried I, for my courage had now entirely failed me, &s;ince you can &s;toop to accept of an extorted compli|ance, I will &s;ee you at Mrs. Hindon's when you occa&s;ionally call; but I &s;hall certainly keep my own apartment, and
<PB N="117" REF="118">
follow my own engagements when I &s;ee proper; nor &s;hall I ever give my con&s;ent to conceal any part of your behaviour from tho&s;e to whom I may choo&s;e to di|vulge it, but you may conclude I &s;hall not be eager to expo&s;e it on my own ac|count.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t promi&s;e me, &s;aid he, promi&s;e me, lovelie&s;t of human beings! that you will not publi&s;h this day's interview ei|ther to my mother, to Mrs. Hindon, or to Mr. Howard; on this condition, and this only will I &s;uffer my charming pri|&s;oner to depart.</P>
<P>You ought to blu&s;h Sir to call me by that name; but &s;ince you are determined, to the&s;e three exceptions I &s;hall unwil|lingly &s;ubmit. Do not imagine, how|ever, that you have it in your power to in|timidate me to grant greater conce&s;&s;ions; for here I &s;olemnly prote&s;t that nothing &s;hall induce me to go further; nor would a generous mind be capable of frighten|ing
<PB N="118" REF="119">
me into promi&s;es which may be above my ability to perform.</P>
<P>No, cried he, I a&s;k no more. I build my future hopes on the opportunities I &s;hall enjoy of pleading my cau&s;e when you are le&s;s di&s;turbed; and I hope you will allow &s;omething for the genero&s;ity of my pre&s;ent behaviour when you are entirely in my power.</P>
<P>Wretch! where was the genero&s;ity he boa&s;ted of? to intimidate&mdash;to terrify me &mdash;and to force me into every mea&s;ure he dared wi&s;h to adopt.</P>
<P>Then let me depart, cried I, for he &s;till held my hand.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid the woman, may I take the liberty of adding one word? As the part I have acted in this matter was out of pure good will to the Captain, I hope you will not mi&s;interpret my permitting this meeting, which the young gentle|man has &s;olicited times without number before I could be brought to con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">No more conditions, &s;aid I, with a haughty air; and after Farnford's odious lips had dwelt almo&s;t a minute on my hand, he led me to my chair, which &s;till remained in waiting though he had u&s;ed the precaution to &s;end away Dubois, as if with orders from me to return home.</P>
<P>Do you not think, my Sophia, that during this morning I had &s;uffered an|gui&s;h and mortifications &s;ufficient: ah no, my dear! a more cruel, a more &s;e|vere pang than any I had endured yet remained, and wholly overpowered me: at that painful moment when the horrid Farnford was putting me into my chair at the bottom of the &s;tairs, Mr. Roat&s;ley pa&s;&s;ed me. I involuntarily &s;tarted on perceiving him, and he &s;uddenly changed colour; but without deigning to pay me the u&s;ual compliments, he contented him|&s;elf with &s;lightly touching his hat, and with a carele&s;s but dejected air ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ing me, walked on.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">I followed him with my eyes, and ob|&s;erved he looked behind; though in|&s;tantly on &s;eeing that I remarked it, he turned away, and I thought I could di&s;tingui&s;h an appearance of chagrin on his countenance that made me regard the audacious Farnford (who ju&s;t at that in|&s;tant bad me farewell) with augmented horror and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Oh heavens! &s;aid I to my&s;elf, as the chair moved along, what has this morn|ing revealed to me. That I'm loved by Roat&s;ley, yet am the object of his contempt. If &s;ome hours ago he &s;eemed inclined to think even better of me than I appeared to de&s;erve, now&mdash;now&mdash;every unfavourable &s;u&s;picion mu&s;t have received full confirmation; and the vexation of my heart drew tears of bitterne&s;s from my eyes. Happily I got unob&s;erved in|to my own apartment, where Fanny im|mediately joined me; and I found &s;ome &s;mall alleviation to my di&s;tre&s;s in relating
<PB N="121" REF="122">
to her all that variety of &s;ingular occur|rences which had befallen me in the cour&s;e of a few hours; but a call to din|ner &s;oon obliged me to dry my eyes, and appear with di&s;&s;embled ea&s;e at table, where there were, as u&s;ual, two or three friends be&s;ides the family.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JAN. 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Fatigued with writing, I laid down my pen to reflect on the tran&s;actions of a day, which, were I to live a thou&s;and years, I &s;hall ever remember with pain. Oh! Sophia! have I not cau&s;e to be wounded to the &s;oul. The man on earth who appears the mo&s;t amiable in my eyes, has conceived perhaps an equal partiality for me; yet a fal&s;e and inju|rious &s;u&s;picion mu&s;t &s;oon, nay mu&s;t al|ready, have entirely obliterated and de|&s;troyed every favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="122" REF="123">
and &s;ub&s;tituted in their room the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t contemptuous &s;entiments. Have I not indeed cau&s;e to be hurt in the ten|dere&s;t part. No method can I devi&s;e for clearing my reputation in Mr. Roat&s;|ley's opinion. I am under a fatal pro|mi&s;e to conceal the whole affair from Mr. Howard, who is the only per&s;on that could have explained with delicacy and propriety any doubts that were to my di&s;advantage, and I have little hopes Roat&s;ley will henceforth feel the &s;lighte&s;t &s;olicitude about me, after the flagrant proof he has this day beheld of my defi|ciency in that point on which he ju&s;tly re&s;ts an importance &s;o material. How can I now flatter my&s;elf, even &s;hould I meet him in public, which is my &s;ole chance of encountering him, that he will give me an opportunity, by con|ver&s;ing with him, to te&s;tify how &s;incerely my &s;oul abhors the wretch who&s;e con|duct merits my &s;corn and dete&s;tation,
<PB N="123" REF="124">
and that my mind is far, far above tho&s;e vile and unaccountable &s;u&s;picions which he has been led, heaven knows how, to entertain again&s;t me.</P>
<P>But how on earth, my dear, have re|ports &s;o infamous, &s;o inconceivable, been circulated at our expence? who could have any intere&s;t in propagating them, and who could have been &s;o infernally wicked as to invent &s;uch injurious fal&s;|hoods, without &s;ome &s;trong and power|ful motive? Is it then po&s;&s;ible to create &s;ecret and treacherous enemies, without performing or wi&s;hing ill to any one? The wretch Brumpton, you may per|ceive, is not alone at the bottom of the&s;e mortifying a&s;per&s;ions; from various quarters it &s;eems they have reached Mr. Roat&s;ley's ears; even from the lips of his mother he &s;ays, though heaven is my witne&s;s I &s;carce knew till this moment that &s;he exi&s;ted; and no &s;ooner, it is pro|bable, has &s;he been made acquainted with
<PB N="124" REF="125">
the &s;ame fact in regard to us, than a thou&s;and infamous calumnies have at|tended the information. A variety of conjectures crowd upon my mind: but the only particular I can re&s;t on with any degree of conviction, is, that Mr. How|ard mu&s;t not have arrived at a period of life enough advanced to allow with pro|priety of two female companions of our age; and this circum&s;tance, to &s;lander|ous di&s;po&s;itions, has mo&s;t undoubtedly given ri&s;e to the&s;e abominable &s;u&s;picions, yet how tainted with vice mu&s;t that heart be, who from an accident &s;o &s;imple and natural, could infer and propagate accu|&s;ations &s;o &s;candalous. If this is the world, Sophia, ten thou&s;and times better it had been for us had we never quitted our peaceful &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening, being what Mrs. Hindon calls her a&s;&s;embly night, we had a crowd of vi&s;itors, who played at cards or conver&s;ed as they were inclined. Mo&s;t
<PB N="125" REF="126">
of them, however, did not remain long enough for either; but, as if &s;atisfied with having te&s;tified their politene&s;s by &s;hew|ing them&s;elves, departed a few minutes after they entered.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon, who, to do her ju&s;tice, never fails in attention towards my &s;i&s;ter and me, introduced to us a number of her friends; but an introduction in Eng|land, &s;eldom or never, I find, is produc|tive of an acquaintance; it &s;erves merely as a pretext that may be laid hold of at plea&s;ure for that purpo&s;e, but which, if di&s;inclined, obliges the parties only to the formality of a di&s;tant curt&s;ey on their next meeting; a ceremony that is often dropped on &s;ucceeding interviews.</P>
<P>You may conclude I was not a little confu&s;ed on hearing Captain Farnford's name announced among the fir&s;t who ap|peared. He walked directly to the &s;o|pha on which I was &s;eated, and very con|fidentially began to enter into conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="126" REF="127">
with me upon general topics with the ea&s;e and familiarity of the mo&s;t per|fect intimacy; but though con&s;trained to remain in his company, I thought it by no means nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h my&s;elf by attending to his di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;oon overflowed with the mo&s;t bomba&s;t and ab&s;urd expre&s;&s;ions of admiration; I there|fore turned from him with unfeigned di&s;gu&s;t, and addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to &s;ome ladies with whom I have contracted a tran&s;ient acquaintance, pretended to be engro&s;&s;ed with what had &s;carce the power of fixing my wandering thoughts. I found e&s;caping from him, however, was quite impracticable, for he followed me for &s;ome time wherever I went with the mo&s;t obtru&s;ive per&s;everance, without &s;eeming to remark the repugnance I did not attempt to conceal, nor the con|temptuous &s;ilence with which I li&s;tened to him.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf my behaviour at length
<PB N="127" REF="128">
had the de&s;ired effect. He began to look proudly di&s;plea&s;ed, and could no longer conceal the painful mortification his va|nity &s;uffered from the cold neglect I di&s;|covered to the di&s;play of his accompli&s;h|ments. Indeed there is a &s;ecret &s;elf-ap|probation and conceit diffu&s;ed over his manner, which, independent of any other con&s;ideration, would have alone rendered him di&s;agreeable to me; though I could perceive he was by no means regarded in this unfavourable point of view by the re&s;t of the company; on the contrary, the younger female part of it &s;eemed to con&s;ider him as a real fine gentleman, who&s;e notice was &s;olicited with an eager|ne&s;s that &s;oothed his pride and &s;oftened his mortification.</P>
<P>A &s;mall party being invited to &s;tay &s;upper, I was rejoiced to find that dur|ing the latter part of the evening he had changed his plan of operations, and in|&s;tead of tormenting me with uncea&s;ing

per&s;ecution, had transferred his atten|tion to a young lady in company, who indeed received it with all the &s;atisfaction he could wi&s;h. He &s;eemed to aim at the old attempt of engaging intere&s;t by ex|citing jealou&s;y; from the idea that the &s;ex cannot with patience &s;ubmit to the mortification of being rivalled even in the admiration of tho&s;e for whom they have no value.

<P>How bu&s;y, my Sophia, is our pre&s;ent way of life, and how various the &s;cenes in which we are engaged. I need now no longer repeat, as I u&s;ed &s;o frequently to do, when my journal was dated from our quiet retreat in Languedoc, that it is deficient in intere&s;t and incident.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="130">More events, my beloved friend, but none of a very plea&s;ing nature.</P>
<P>We have hitherto left the regulation of our finances wholly to Mr. Howard's care; who, more accu&s;tomed to matters of this kind than it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed my &s;i&s;ter or I could be, with his u&s;ual good|ne&s;s undertook to manage all our bu&s;i|ne&s;s of this nature; being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large &s;um for pre&s;ent u&s;e, which is not yet exhau&s;ted, and concluding our fortunes &s;ecure in the funds under the in&s;pection of Mr. Ben&s;eley's executors, we imagined our&s;elves certain of inde|pendence.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard has been under &s;ome ap|prehen&s;ions, I believe, about this money ever &s;ince our arrival here, though he forbore alarming us till the truth could be no longer concealed. The &s;um is twenty thou&s;and pounds; all my father ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and for which he &s;o|lemnly relinqui&s;hed all further claims or
<PB N="130" REF="131">
expectations from his father's bounty (a precaution I find which was unnece&s;&s;ary). This Mr. Ben&s;eley had originally placed in the &s;tocks; but a few days previous to his demi&s;e, &s;ome change in public credit unfortunately induced him to &s;ell out at a very great price, no doubt with the intention of laying out the money to more advantage. His death, however, unluckily taking place in the interim, no paper can be found by which the real proprietors of that money are a&s;certained. A note alone has been di&s;covered, in which Mr. Ben&s;eley acknowledges a debt to my father of four thou&s;and pounds; and it is but too probable that Fanny and I mu&s;t content our&s;elves with this &s;mall portion of that affluence of which we always concluded our&s;elves &s;ecure. What is wor&s;e, Mr. Ben&s;eley's affairs are in &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ment and confu&s;ion, that we &s;hall not enjoy this little pittance till all is cleared; and as there are a
<PB N="131" REF="132">
number of creditors, it is likely that even this may be con&s;iderably reduced.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard &s;trives to per&s;uade us that things may turn out better, and that it is not impo&s;&s;ible but &s;ome lights may yet appear to prove our claims. He has con&s;ulted lawyers on the occa&s;ion, but he confe&s;&s;es they are not &s;anguine, having given it as their opinion that unle&s;s wri|tings are found which plainly evince our right, a law&s;uit would be an expen&s;ive and ineffectual expedient; and it is evi|dent, from the friendly chagrin with which he ju&s;t now divulged this di&s;a|greeable intelligence, that he thinks only part of this debt will be recovered. As to our fortune, that is irretrievably gone.</P>
<P>It has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that the pecuniary di&s;appointments inflicted by Fortune never produce a la&s;ting or pain|ful wound except to minds tainted with avarice: if we are enabled to live with decency and independence, though with
<PB N="132" REF="133">
the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy, on what &s;till re|mains to us, I &s;hould blu&s;h to repine at our lo&s;s, though manifold are the advan|tages re&s;ulting from affluence, and grate|ful the plea&s;ure which di&s;pen&s;ing it pro|cures to the heart.</P>
<P>If our grandfather &s;hould prove in|exorable, Sophia, the pro&s;pect now is not a comfortable one: but I will not allow an unnece&s;&s;ary anxiety about the future to add one moment's unea&s;ine&s;s to my pre&s;ent vexations: Lord Belmont never can permit us to remain in ab&s;o|lute poverty: at all events, if we are re|jected by him, ob&s;curity mu&s;t be our portion; and then a little&mdash;a very little will enable us to &s;ub&s;i&s;t with comfort and decency.</P>

<P>OH! my Sophia! how infinitely am I &s;hocked with a di&s;covery I have made.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, when I went to Mrs. Wel|don's, I found her alone. Her friend, &s;he told me, had &s;ent an apology, being a little indi&s;po&s;ed; but as you are &s;o &s;o|ber, &s;aid &s;he, I hope you will be almo&s;t as well plea&s;ed to &s;it and chat <HI>tete &agrave; tete</HI> with me, for I expect nobody el&s;e.</P>
<P>I told her &s;he paid her&s;elf a bad com|pliment, if &s;he imagined I did not prefer her company to that of her friends, and that I could not avoid enjoying the lady's
<PB N="134" REF="135">
detention. Soon after a hand organ in the &s;treet attracted our attention, and &s;everal well known French opera tunes were played very agreeably by a Savoy|ard, who&s;e wife and child made a rude but not unplea&s;ant accompanyment upon in&s;truments that &s;eemed to have been invented in the very infancy of mu&s;ic. The effect altogether was delightful; and the &s;ound of airs which had been taught me in my own country recalling a thou|&s;and &s;oft and affecting recollections, con|veyed me in imagination to dear Lan|guedoc, and threw me into a reverie that wholly ab&s;orbed me.</P>
<P>An intention of rewarding the per|former the more liberally perhaps from con&s;idering him in &s;ome mea&s;ure as my countryman, induced me to pull up the &s;a&s;h to throw him &s;ome money; and ju&s;t at that in&s;tant I perceived Mr. Roat&s;ley pa&s;s the window. He was walking with another gentleman; but on beholding
<PB N="135" REF="136">
me &s;uddenly &s;tarted, and bowing &s;lightly, with an air of extreme embarra&s;&s;ment and confu&s;ion ha&s;tily walked away.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of him threw me into a per|turbation not to be conceived. I felt my&s;elf colour violently; and was &s;carcely able to &s;tand. Mrs. Weldon, who from attentively li&s;tening to the mu&s;ic had not ob&s;erved the gentlemen, though &s;he was &s;tanding at the window by me, exclaimed, Good heavens, my dear, what can be the matter? You are all over crim&s;on. A|fraid of her raillery, I cho&s;e not to reveal the real truth, and gave her an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, expre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch awkward|ne&s;s that it would by no means an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended; but on the con|trary, by exciting her curio&s;ity induced her to look out of the window. I knew there mu&s;t be &s;omething at the bottom, cried &s;he laughing. Upon my word two very hand&s;ome youths, though I can only &s;ee their backs, for they are almo&s;t
<PB N="136" REF="137">
at the end of the &s;treet. However I in|&s;i&s;t on being informed which of the two it is, the mere &s;ight of whom has di&s;|compo&s;ed you &s;o prodigiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>After this attack, you may believe I did not chu&s;e to afford her a &s;ubject for teizing me by confe&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e of my agitation; as I well knew how delighted &s;he always is with a topic on which to di&s;play her wit and vivacity. The infor|mation that it was Mr. Roat&s;ley was little calculated to make her &s;pare me; and be&s;ides of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t have led to a communication which I did not wi&s;h. I therefore evaded her enquiries in the be&s;t manner I could contrive, though not without difficulty, under pretence of an indi&s;po&s;ition which I knew &s;he did not credit.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia! the expre&s;&s;ive manner in which Roat&s;ley regarded me, was &s;o &s;triking, that it mu&s;t have made the mo&s;t forcible impre&s;&s;ion on my mind had I
<PB N="137" REF="138">
even received no hints to guide me to unravel its meaning; but after the dread|ful intelligence which accident has brought to my knowledge, too well, alas! am I enabled to interpret the gravity and melancholy that was &s;trongly pictured in his countenance. But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to other particulars&mdash;particulars that have &s;hocked me beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Mrs. Weldon and I had fi|ni&s;hed a <HI>tete &agrave; tete</HI> meal, a thundering rap announced vi&s;itors, and the in&s;tant after Sir Edward, (for I know not his other name,) entered.</P>
<P>I was &s;omewhat di&s;compo&s;ed at his ap|pearance, after the freedom of his be|haviour the evening I had been in his company; though to do him ju&s;tice, he had treated me with more re&s;pect than &s;eemed to influence the re&s;t of his com|panions. I therefore a&s;&s;umed a look of grave re&s;erve, and took no part in a very lively di&s;cour&s;e which in&s;tantly com|menced
<PB N="138" REF="139">
between him and Mrs. Weldon, though they often &s;everally addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to me, and made many at|tempts to engage me in it.</P>
<P>After &s;itting a quarter of an hour, Mrs. Weldon left the room to bring &s;ome drawings for the animadver&s;ion of Sir Edward, who profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a connoi&s;|&s;eur; and concluding &s;he would imme|diately return, I kept my &s;eat, with the intention of remaining till Mrs. Hindon and Fanny &s;hould call for me in their way to an a&s;&s;embly, whither I meant to accompany them. But &s;carce was &s;he gone, when Sir Edward, advancing, re|&s;umed the &s;tile of addre&s;s with which I had been &s;o much importuned the la&s;t time I had been in his company; and throwing him&s;elf at my feet, with a pro|fu&s;ion of the mo&s;t extravagant compli|ments &s;wore he had adored me ever &s;ince he had enjoyed the happine&s;s of &s;eeing me, and that he had been the mo&s;t mi|&s;erable
<PB N="139" REF="140">
of men, and mu&s;t remain &s;o, unle&s;s I would di&s;card the cold and cruel re|&s;erve with which I received all his atten|tions.</P>
<P>I was petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment; and ri&s;ing in order to leave him, a&s;&s;ured him I never di&s;covered either di&s;tance or re|pugnance, but in company which natu|rally in&s;pired tho&s;e feelings.</P>
<P>Lovelie&s;t of women! cried he, where|in can I have been &s;o wretched as to di&s;|plea&s;e you? How can I have inadver|tently fallen into an error which is the fault on earth I &s;hould mo&s;t deplore, and which were it nece&s;&s;ary I would expiate with my life. Do not imagine, all divine as you are, that your charms can be heightened or your beauty rendered more irre&s;i&s;tible from that air of haughtine&s;s and di&s;dain, which would de&s;troy the power of any features but your own, nor conclude that you will augment the num|ber of your &s;laves from the &s;everity and
<PB N="140" REF="141">
cruelty of the chains with which you mu&s;t bind all hearts that behold you.</P>
<P>Sir, cried I, confounded at this &s;peech, and a great many others in the &s;ame &s;train which &s;ucceeded, and &s;till more by the manner in which they were pronounced, while he &s;tood between me and the door with the intention of preventing me from e&s;caping&mdash;for heaven's &s;ake allow me to depart. I flattered my&s;elf the di&s;appro|bation I te&s;tified &s;o lately at a &s;imilar be|haviour, would have entirely put an end to compliments and a conver&s;ation which confounds and bewilders me; and I al&s;o hoped that the regret you expre&s;&s;ed for having alarmed and &s;hocked me, would not have been &s;o &s;oon followed by the &s;ame inhumanity. I thought my&s;elf un|der obligations to you then Sir, for re|lieving me from another gentleman's per&s;ecution; let me, I entreat you, have rea&s;on to expre&s;s my thanks once more for delivering me from your own.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142">The earne&s;tne&s;s with which I uttered the&s;e words &s;eemed to &s;trike him; yet for &s;ome time he went on in the &s;ame in|comprehen&s;ible &s;tile, till at length I ex|claimed&mdash;What on earth Sir does all this mean? I am perplexed and bewildered. I know not what to make of your di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid he, with an evident change in his countenance and &s;ome he|&s;itation, my conver&s;ation cannot have confounded and bewildered you more than yours a&s;toni&s;hes me. If &s;uch are your real &s;entiments, why do I behold you here?</P>
<P>At this que&s;tion, pronounced &s;o &s;eri|ou&s;ly, I felt as if I was thunder&s;truck. A thou&s;and &s;u&s;picions, confu&s;ed and terri|fying, ru&s;hed upon my mind.</P>
<P>Tell me, cried I with terror, tell me why I ought not to be here.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Seymour, an&s;wered he with en|crea&s;ing earne&s;tne&s;s, I blu&s;h for my&s;elf.
<PB N="142" REF="143">
I perceive I have been egregiou&s;ly de|ceived, and my confu&s;ion deprives me of power to apologize for my behaviour. All that I now can do to atone for my offence is, to inform you that this hou&s;e is by no means a proper place, nor is its owner a &s;afe companion, for a young lady of your appearance.</P>
<P>My God! exclaimed I in horror, for at that in&s;tant he who had been but a moment before the object of my di&s;like and apprehen&s;ion, &s;eemed now my &s;ole dependance and only &s;ecurity from in&s;ult and de&s;pair&mdash;My God! what &s;hall I do?</P>
<P>Be not alarmed I be&s;eech you, cried he, and be a&s;&s;ured that as certainly as I have warned you of your danger I &s;hall my&s;elf &s;ecure you from it. You have nothing to fear.</P>
<P>I was very near fainting, from the &s;hock of this dreadful information; and anxious as was my de&s;ire of quitting in|&s;tantly the hou&s;e, I had not power to
<PB N="143" REF="144">
move. At la&s;t, when I had a little re|covered my&s;elf, I entreated Sir Edward to order a chair. He in&s;tantly complied; and having pulled the bell, de&s;ired the footman to make ha&s;te.</P>
<P>The &s;hort interval which pa&s;&s;ed till the chair was ready, was the mo&s;t awk|ward that can be imagined. My un|&s;peakable impatience rendered it an age; and to my agitation and terror was &s;uper|added the mo&s;t painful confu&s;ion. I could hardly look Sir Edward in the face after the explanation he had made of my &s;ituation, and he him&s;elf &s;eemed equally at a lo&s;s. My di&s;tre&s;s was not, you may conceive, much abated, by an expre&s;&s;ion which inadvertently dropt from him upon my confe&s;&s;ing my apprehen&s;ions for Mrs. Weldon's return before I had left the hou&s;e. Be a&s;&s;ured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Madam, &s;aid he, &s;he will take particular care not to interrupt us.

planned the interview; in procuring which &s;he probably pur&s;ued her own in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>Good heavens, Sophia, is it po&s;&s;ible that this woman, to whom nature has been &s;o bountiful, &s;o prodigal of her gifts; who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o abundantly the in&s;inu|ating power of plea&s;ing and who&s;e con|ver&s;ation is in general as refinedly delicate as it is judicious and agreeable&mdash;is it po&s;|&s;ible that &s;he is the mo&s;t infamous and abandoned of her &s;ex: &s;he who enjoys the talent of engaging admiration and affection almo&s;t in the very moment that her conduct cannot but excite di&s;appro|bation? Good heavens! into what a gulph of mi&s;ery might I not have been plunged, had not the hand of Providence been held forth to extri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e me from the labyrinth of de&s;truction in which I had been entangled.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant the chair arrived, Sir Ed|ward &s;upported me into it, for I could
<PB N="145" REF="148">
&s;carce move; having fir&s;t procured me a gla&s;s of water, which my impatience &s;uffered me only ju&s;t to put to my lips. Having no attendant, Sir Edward was &s;o obliging as to walk by the &s;ide of the chair to &s;ee me &s;afe home; where I found Mrs. Hindon and Fanny dre&s;t for their vi&s;it; but perceiving me &s;o ill and di&s;or|dered, I could prevail with neither to fulfil their intention, my &s;i&s;ter po&s;itively refu&s;ing to leave me, and Mrs. Hindon imagining her&s;elf obliged in politene&s;s to appear equally anxious.</P>
<P>As that lady's love of talking renders her often imprudently communicative, I did not choo&s;e to confe&s;s the private cau&s;e of my indi&s;po&s;ition, but retiring to my apartment, poured out the fulne&s;s of my heart to my dear Fanny, who lifted up her hands and eyes to heaven in a&s;toni&s;h|ment that &s;uch a character exi&s;ted on earth.</P>
<P>When I recall to mind the addre&s;s with
<PB N="146" REF="149">
which Mrs. Weldon contrived to impo&s;e upon me, and the ingenious methods by which &s;he in&s;pired me with the be&s;t opi|nion of her heart, I am lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;h|ment and horror to think that &s;uch a character lives. Here then is the infa|mous and &s;ecret cau&s;e brought to light of that warm attachment which me te&s;ti|fied with &s;o much fervour to us both, but chiefly to me, and which &s;tole &s;o imper|ceptibly upon my affections, that &s;he was every day gaining ground in our e&s;teem, in &s;pite of &s;everal little improprieties of behaviour, that &s;erved however only as foils to her other good qualities, and to which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of giving what turn &s;he plea&s;ed. Under pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s, I now recollect &s;he never would con&s;ent to vi&s;it at Mr. Hindon's, though I carried repeated me&s;&s;ages from his lady a&s;&s;uring her &s;he &s;hould be happy to &s;ee any of our friends, that morning ex|cepted when &s;he ventured to call for the

purpo&s;e of &s;oliciting my forgivene&s;s in order to further the barbarous purpo&s;e of engaging me to meet Sir Edward. He no doubt had bribed her to his purpo&s;e. Let me not blame him however, whate|ver were the &s;teps he took to obtain the interview, &s;ince the artfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> woman no doubt repre&s;ented me to him in a fal&s;e point of view, and the delicacy of his be|haviour on this occa&s;ion has laid me un|der obligations to him which I can never recall without gratitude. So &s;acred mu&s;t I hold the fame of a woman, how|ever infamous, whom I once called my friend, that I will not confe&s;s even to Mr. Howard what dupes we have been to her artifice and duplicity. As for Mrs. Hindon, my terror and e&s;cape would to her appear ju&s;t the counterpart of the good &s;tory of my alarm before, and would I make no doubt prove equally the &s;ub|ject of her mirth and diversion. I there|fore re&s;olved to &s;ay nothing of an event
<PB N="148" REF="151">
which has &s;hocked me &s;everely, farther than to acknowledge that &s;ome reports of her conduct have reached my ears which have induced me no longer to con|tinue our intimacy.</P>
<P>Poor Madame de Clarence! Much, much, I fear, &s;he has had &s;ufficient rea|&s;on for her jealou&s;y; and I accu&s;e my&s;elf mo&s;t &s;everely for having given credit to the vile ridicule thrown on her by Mrs. Weldon.</P>
<P>I &s;lept little all night; and to-day I really feel more uncomfortable than can be conceived. I have not only lo&s;t a friend and an agreeable companion, which of it&s;elf in our &s;ituation is irrepa|rable, but I have found her to be crimi|nal and unworthy. I fear I &s;hall grow &s;u&s;picious in future; for never could I have been more compleatly deceived than with regard to Mrs. Weldon, who&s;e greate&s;t fault I imagined con&s;i&s;ted in a love of admiration and a pa&s;&s;ion for co|quetry,
<PB N="149" REF="152">
which is &s;aid in &s;ome degree to pervade the whole &s;ex, and often &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the mo&s;t innocent hearts.</P>
<P>But oh! can you gue&s;s the circum|&s;tance which of all others tortures me the mo&s;t painfully, and dwells perpetually in my thoughts? What mu&s;t Mr. Roat&s;|ley's ideas have been, how mu&s;t his &s;u&s;|picions have received confirmation, from beholding me &s;tanding with a woman of this character, at the window of her re|&s;idence. No wonder that he &s;tarted and changed colour. No doubt he had heard of her before; and I can now partly trace the cau&s;e of tho&s;e calumnies, to account for which puzzled and perplexed me &s;o extremely. Our intimacy with Mrs. Wel|don mu&s;t have been the origin of all the defamatory reports that have reached his ears. But oh! Sophia! how will he be undeceived&mdash;and when? Is there any thing &s;o tender, &s;o delicate, &s;o irretrieva|ble, as the reputation of a young woman?
<PB N="150" REF="153">
and when once wounded in the &s;lighte&s;t manner, however injudiciou&s;ly and un|ju&s;tly, how difficult does it prove wholly to obliterate the &s;tain and to efface the fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion. This dreadful reflec|tion hurts me to the &s;oul, and for &s;ome time was quite intolerable. But a few hours con&s;ideration have abated in &s;ome mea&s;ure its acute force; and I have been calling up the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of con&s;cious in|nocence and dignity to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which tells me it is weakne&s;s to allow ca|lumny to poi&s;on that repo&s;e which has never been embittered from vice.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon in&s;i&s;ts on our attending her this evening to the Opera, an enter|tainment at which we have not yet been pre&s;ent; for as I agree with Lady Lin|ro&s;e in opinion that till we are properly introduced we ought not often to appear in public, I have hitherto re&s;i&s;ted all her intreaties, though it is the amu&s;ement, if of any, from which I promi&s;e my&s;elf

taken of enquiring after my health; but the &s;ituation in which I left you la&s;t night, Madam, &s;aid he, gave me &s;o much un|ea&s;ine&s;s, that my de&s;ire of making per&s;o|nal enquiries was not to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf at fir&s;t a little embar|ra&s;&s;ed; but &s;ummoned courage to tell him that his vi&s;it required no &s;ort of apo|logy, as I &s;hould ever regard my&s;elf as particularly indebted to him for an ex|planation which might not otherwi&s;e for &s;ome time have reached my ears. This &s;peech, &s;hort as it was, alluded to recol|lections which wounded me &s;o &s;everely, that my cheeks were dyed with blu&s;hes; and I he&s;itated more than once before I came to the conclu&s;ion. Sir Edward him&s;elf &s;eemed almo&s;t in equal confu&s;ion; and his manner appeared &s;o mode&s;t, mild, and re&s;pectful, that I could &s;carce recog|nize him for the man who had joined with his riotous companions in giving me &s;uch pain and mortification. But large
<PB N="153" REF="156">
allowances ought certainly to be made for his behaviour where his freedom was neither &s;u&s;pected to occa&s;ion pain nor ap|prehended to be con&s;idered as an in&s;ult.</P>

<P>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;terday evening we accompanied Mrs. Hindon to the Opera, the amu&s;e|ment of all others the mo&s;t &s;uited to my ta&s;te; indeed in the &s;tate my &s;pirits then were, it was the only one for which I could have felt the &s;lighte&s;t reli&s;h. A faint hope which I had entertained, that chance might carry Roat&s;ley there al&s;o, conquered my reluctance at going, and &s;upported me with courage and &s;pirits for the exertion.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I was &s;eated, I ca&s;t my eyes around the hou&s;e in hopes of &s;eeing him, though I well knew the confu&s;ion the &s;ight of him mu&s;t have given me, but
<PB N="154" REF="157">
without &s;ucce&s;s, for he was no where to be found.</P>
<P>Sunk and di&s;appointed, I tried to at|tend to the mu&s;ic; and endeavoured to forget my dejection by participating in the general gaiety that &s;at on every coun|tenance but mine. My attempts were however fruitle&s;s. The &s;ongs, which in private u&s;ed to charm me, now, though improved to the highe&s;t pitch of perfec|tion by the mo&s;t admirable vocal per|formers and the mo&s;t excellent accom|panyment, could not even fix my wan|dering attention; and Mrs. Hindon's re|marks, by interrupting a train of ideas that ab&s;orbed me, proved extremely fa|tigueing. Her ince&s;&s;ant talking, poor woman, indeed almo&s;t exhau&s;ted me, and I felt as a &s;evere talk the &s;hare I was con&s;trained to take in a conver&s;ation &s;o little intere&s;ting. Oh! how painful it is, Sophia, to cover a heavy heart under the ma&s;k of chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158">Melico had at length began one of his mo&s;t melting &s;ongs; and it accorded &s;o well "with my &s;oul's &s;adne&s;s" at that moment, that not only my attention was unavoidably engaged, but my inquietude &s;oothed and lulled into compo&s;ure. At this moment I accidentally di&s;covered the face I had &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought in one of the &s;ide boxes, not very far di&s;tant from that part of the pit where I was placed. I felt my face glow and my heart beat with great violence. He did not however ob&s;erve me; but &s;tood be|hind a young lady, who was indeed un|commonly beautiful, and with whom he conver&s;ed with infinite eagerne&s;s and ani|mation. I thought I could perceive that their di&s;cour&s;e was equally intere&s;ting to both. They &s;miled delighted to each other, at particular pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ong that &s;eemed to enchant them, and though &s;urrounded by &s;everal per&s;ons of both
<PB N="156" REF="159">
&s;exes, appeared wholly engro&s;&s;ed with each other.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, however, he looked round; and on di&s;covering us bowed with po|litene&s;s, which in&s;tantly carried the eyes of the young lady towards our party; and the moment after I &s;aw that &s;he was en|quiring of him who we were. The ideas which this little circum&s;tance produced, and my conjectures what an&s;wer he could give to her interrogatories, added to my pain and confu&s;ion. Soon after I ob|&s;erved that he had quitted her; and while I was watching with anxiety to find in what part of the hou&s;e he meant to place him&s;elf, gue&s;s my perturbation on find|ing that he had actually &s;eated him&s;elf on the bench immediately behind me, where there happened to be a &s;pare place. His face was over&s;pread with a deep colour while he paid me his compliments; and there was an air of gravity and penetra|tion in his countenance, as if he &s;ought
<PB N="157" REF="160">
in mine the refutation or confirmation of his doubts, while this &s;u&s;picion mortified and wounded me &s;o cruelly, that I was apprehen&s;ive of rai&s;ing the &s;ame commo|tion I had done at the play.</P>
<P>He perceived I looked di&s;turbed; and attributing it to the extreme heat, en|quired with &s;uch evident &s;oftne&s;s if I was not ill, that the tender and unexpected anxiety he manife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion gave an in&s;tant revival to my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>He then regretted his bad fortune, he &s;aid, in having &s;o unluckily mi&s;&s;ed &s;eeing us when he had called at Mr. Hindon's both that day and the evening before; this, through the negligence of that gen|tleman's &s;ervants, had never come to our knowledge; and oh! what unea&s;ine&s;s would it not have &s;pared me to have known that Mr. Roat&s;ley had taken this &s;tep towards having his unju&s;t &s;urmi&s;es confuted. I a&s;&s;ured him the favour he had done us had been entirely unknown
<PB N="158" REF="161">
to Mr. Howard, who undoubtedly would have immediately acknowledged his at|tention. He then began to talk of our accidental rencontre in the packet boat, and paid me a number of unmerited com|pliments on the compo&s;ure of my be|haviour; for although I did not, like my poor Fanny, allow my terrors to di&s;|tract me, I was very far from de&s;erving the encomiums he lavi&s;hed on me. Pray my Sophia does not his exaggerations on this occa&s;ion betray&mdash; But I &s;ee you &s;mile. I will however be perfectly un|re&s;erved.&mdash;Does it not manife&s;t &s;omething like partiality? and may I not draw this inference from it, that he will be open to conviction. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his I may &s;urely be confident; that although to the eye of a man &s;o penetrating, &s;o intelligent as Roat&s;|ley, many errors and defects in my man|ner and conver&s;ation mu&s;t be apparent, new as I am to the world and ignorant of its forms and etiquettes, yet no real im|propriety,
<PB N="159" REF="162">
nothing below the dignity of the female character, can po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;|covered by a candid and well di&s;po&s;ed mind; and this little pride, my dear, en|abled me, after my fir&s;t flutters were over, to acquit my&s;elf during the remain|der of the evening with tolerable ea&s;e. Supported by con&s;cious rectitude, I de|termined not to yield to the ba&s;hfulne&s;s and con&s;traint which were &s;tealing upon me; but in ju&s;tice to my own character to &s;hew my&s;elf to him &s;uch as I really was, and leave him to repent and blu&s;h for the injury he had done me.</P>
<P>He often recurred to the accident that had produced our acquaintance, and called it the mo&s;t fortunate of his life The mo&s;t fortunate of your life, cried Fanny, who is extremely literal: that is &s;trange indeed. Sure there can be no &s;ort of plea&s;ure in being frightened out of one's wits, and very near being drowned into
<PB N="160" REF="163">
the bargain? for my own part I never reflect on it without horror.</P>
<P>This return to his compliment, ut|tered with &s;uch <HI>naivit&eacute;,</HI> made him &s;mile. Nay, &s;aid &s;he, the &s;torm was &s;o violent that I think the mo&s;t courageous of men needed not have blu&s;hed to have owned them&s;elves terrified.</P>
<P>Had I been in danger of lo&s;ing my cou|rage on that occa&s;ion, &s;aid he, Mi&s;s Sey|mour would have taught me my duty.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard at this moment joined us. Mr. Roat&s;ley and he &s;eemed mutu|ally plea&s;ed at meeting; and &s;oon after the latter whi&s;pered that Lady Linro&s;e was in the hou&s;e, and pointed her out to us in the box which Roat&s;ley had ju&s;t quitted.</P>
<P>Our curio&s;ity to &s;ee her was inexpre&s;|&s;ible: &s;he &s;eems under fifty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an air of maje&s;tic dignity in her appear|ance, blended however with a cold &s;e|verity of a&s;pect that de&s;troys the admira|tion
<PB N="161" REF="164">
her figure excites, and renders her countenance har&s;h and unamiable. It is indeed wholly devoid of that affability of expre&s;&s;ion which denotes a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed, and which ever confers plea&s;ure on the beholder. The in&s;tant I had &s;tudied her features, I could not per&s;uade my&s;elf I &s;hould ever recognize either the kind relation or tender friend in Lady Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>From having ob&s;erved Mr. Roat&s;ley of her party, I naturally conjectured he mu&s;t be of her acquaintance, and began to flatter my&s;elf that through this unex|pected channel of intelligence I might be able to learn &s;ome particulars relating to a family, with whom, in &s;pite of our pre&s;ent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, we may one day become as intimately connected by af|fection as we are at pre&s;ent from con&s;an|guinity. I therefore demanded if he was acquainted with that lady in black, point|ing
<PB N="162" REF="165">
to the part of the hou&s;e where &s;he was placed.</P>
<P>What lady pray? &s;aid he.</P>
<P>That lady, cried Fanny: &s;he who &s;its to the right in the box you were ju&s;t now &s;eated in. Don't you think &s;he is the mo&s;t &s;evere, di&s;agreeable-looking woman you ever beheld.</P>
<P>What lady do you talk of? repeated he, a&s;toni&s;hed no doubt at Fanny's in|con&s;iderate warmth of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e, returned &s;he. You have been of her party all this time. Sure you mu&s;t know her?</P>
<P>As Mr. Roat&s;ley was &s;ilent, and did not &s;eem inclined to give the &s;lighte&s;t en|couragement to Fanny's thoughtle&s;s im|prudence, who, unacquainted with the etiquette of &s;ociety, perpetually di&s;re|gards the little artifices which common politene&s;s demands, and never once con|&s;idered that Lady Linro&s;e might be, for any thing &s;he knew, one of the mo&s;t inti|mate
<PB N="163" REF="166">
of his friends, I endeavoured to check her from proceeding farther, but in vain. Lord, continued &s;he, inatten|tive to the coldne&s;s with which he li&s;tened to her remarks, don't you think &s;he looks cro&s;s and ill-natured? I have not once ob&s;erved her &s;mile or look plea&s;ed all the while I have been watching her countenance: be&s;ides Hermione, turning to me, is it not very &s;trange for a widow to make a public appearance &s;o early. I thought nobody had done &s;o in Eng|land till at lea&s;t &s;ix months after their hu&s;band's decea&s;e; did not Mrs. Hindon &s;ay &s;o the other evening, when we were on this &s;ubject? Oh! but I had forgot that they did not live together, and my Lord was &s;o ill-humoured, I &s;uppo&s;e, her Lady&s;hip con&s;idered him as no great lo&s;s, though I think &s;he might have &s;hewn a little more regard to his me|mory though only for the &s;ake of decency.</P>
<P>I tried by a look to &s;top her volubility:
<PB N="164" REF="167">
though in fact my own &s;entiments of her Lady&s;hip's conduct in this la&s;t in&s;tance were &s;imilar to my &s;i&s;ter's. Her <HI>prudence</HI> has not impre&s;&s;ed us, you may believe, with the mo&s;t favourable opinion of her <HI>heart</HI>; and this procedure, which I am told is unu&s;ual, was not calculated, for improving it.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley's gravity deterred me, however, from avowing my &s;ecret thoughts. Pray, &s;aid he to Fanny, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, with a half &s;mile&mdash;has Lady Linro&s;e the honour of your ac|quaintance?</P>
<P>Oh! Lord! no, cried &s;he, without con&s;idering how unaccountable this vio|lent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t an utter &s;tranger mu&s;t appear, I never beheld her in my life till this moment.</P>
<P>Then how, pray, has &s;he been &s;o un|lucky as to fall under your di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>My di&s;plea&s;ure! cried &s;he, embar|ra&s;&s;ed; oh not at all. I merely di&s;like
<PB N="165" REF="168">
her appearance. She looks &s;ulky and proud, and I hate tho&s;e &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>She is very unfortunate indeed, re|turned he. I then contrived to put a period to the &s;ubject by calling Fanny's attention to another object; for I dreaded the &s;u&s;picion and curio&s;ity her &s;implicity might excite in Mr. Roat&s;ley, who &s;eemed both amu&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed at her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Not for a moment during the remain|der of the evening did he leave us; and by the vivacity of his di&s;cour&s;e, and the amiable gentlene&s;s of his manner, he in|&s;en&s;ibly re&s;tored my tranquillity, di&s;&s;ipated my confu&s;ion, and in&s;pired me with a flow of &s;pirits almo&s;t equal to what ap|pears natural to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When all was concluded, he attended us to Mrs. Hindon's carriage; and re|que&s;ted leave, in polite terms, to indem|nify him&s;elf, he &s;aid, for his late di&s;ap|pointment by waiting on us again.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="169">I have not &s;pent an evening &s;o agree|ably &s;ince that we pa&s;&s;ed at Dover. In|deed I even give la&s;t night greatly the preference, it having all the advantages of a mo&s;t painful contra&s;t to enhance its value. My &s;ufferings in the early part of the evening conferred a double reli&s;h on the &s;atisfaction of the &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>I feel my&s;elf now relieved from a load of unea&s;ine&s;s which I &s;upported with much anxiety; for I am convinced from Roat&s;ley's behaviour la&s;t night, nay from the very expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance, that we are completely ju&s;tified in his opinion, at lea&s;t with regard to the vile a&s;per&s;ions &s;o cruelly circulated again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Sudbury, who did not ob&s;erve us till near the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t dance, joined us before we left the hou&s;e, and reque&s;ted me to introduce him to Mrs. Hindon; which, as I wi&s;hed that lady to remain ignorant of the cir|cum&s;tances of our acquaintance, was ra|ther
<PB N="167" REF="170">
di&s;agreeable to me; however I had no choice, and fortunately contrived to evade her enquiries by informing her of my own accord that I had been in com|pany with him at Mrs. Weldon's.</P>
<P>We are beginning to grow extremely impatient for di&s;patches from Nice. Mr. Howard tells us that by cour&s;e of po&s;t we ought to have received letters before this time; and &s;urely on this &s;ub|ject little time for con&s;ideration is re|quired. Why then does Lord Belmont retain us in &s;u&s;pence.</P>

<P>Mrs. Hindon being rather indi&s;po&s;ed to-day, &s;he kept her room all the morn|ing, and taking my work, I went to &s;it with her, Fanny having gone to call upon Lady Farnford, who&s;e repeated ci|vilities
<PB N="168" REF="171">
demanded or rather extort &s;ome return on our part.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon was very pre&s;&s;ing with me to accompany her; but you may be|lieve her entreaties had no &s;ort of effect: as the &s;ight of Captain Farnford was ab&s;olutely di&s;agreeable to me, it would be &s;trange indeed, I &s;aid, if I threw my|&s;elf in his way when it was in my power &s;o ea&s;ily to avoid it.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it naturally led the &s;ubject to that family, upon which Mrs. Hindon began to lavi&s;h a thou&s;and encomiums. Lady Farnford is her relation; and there has ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them from in|fancy a very intimate friend&s;hip. They are extremely oppo&s;ite in point of ap|pearance; Lady Farnford being a little lean figure, with a very cold and dry ad|dre&s;s; but they are both equally prying and inqui&s;itive, which is I &s;uppo&s;e their chief bond of union, though Lady Farn|ford does not talk &s;o much in a week as her friend does in one day.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="172">Captain Farnford, Mrs. Hindon &s;aid, had always been reckoned a young man of very &s;hining parts, and his figure and addre&s;s were &s;ingularly elegant. He was a little wild to be &s;ure; but what of that? few young ladies regarded that error as a material fault at his time of life, and in him it &s;eemed more the effects of life and gaiety than of any inclination to vice. Some people, it was true, thought him a little extravagant; but this was the foi|ble of a generous mind. For her part, to &s;ee a young man too <HI>near,</HI> was of all things what mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted her; be&s;ides, continued &s;he, as he is not yet burthened with a wife and family, no doubt he has not turned his mind towards oecono|my; but when he is once fairly &s;ettled, I'll an&s;wer for it it will be the &s;tudy of his life in all re&s;pects to render the wo|man of his choice compleatly happy.</P>
<P>I began now to &s;u&s;pect to what all this tended. I tried, however, to ward off
<PB N="170" REF="173">
an explanation, by coldly acquie&s;cing in her &s;entiments as a per&s;on unintere&s;ted in the cau&s;e; but my plan would not &s;uc|ceed.</P>
<P>I am glad you think &s;o, Mi&s;s Sey|mour, cried &s;he, for indeed, to tell you the real truth of the matter, the poor Captain is quite in de&s;pair at your di&s;tant and frigid manner towards him; and my Lady, who&s;e heart is wrapt up in her &s;on's happine&s;s, and who her&s;elf admires you above all women, de&s;ires nothing on earth &s;o fervently as that he may render him&s;elf acceptable to you. Many a good match has been propo&s;ed to Captain Farnford, I a&s;&s;ure you; but till he &s;aw you he hated the very idea of matrimo|ny, to which now he annexes every hope of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I am extremely &s;orry Madam, an|&s;wered I, to receive this information. I flattered my&s;elf my behaviour had &s;uffi|ciently explained to Captain Farnford that
<PB N="171" REF="174">
my &s;entiments were fixed and immovea|ble on this head, and I imagined, if he &s;till deceived him&s;elf, you was able to have convinced him how little &s;ucce&s;sful this application could ever be. If how|ever you Madam have been commi&s;&s;ioned to talk with me on the &s;ubject, I entreat you will no longer delay acquainting him at once from me, that there is not the &s;lighte&s;t chance&mdash;there is not even a po&s;|&s;ibility of my altering my re&s;olution. I hope you will excu&s;e me when I acknow|ledge, added I, that there is hardly any propo&s;al could be made to me at which I &s;hould feel a more invincible repug|nance, and I earne&s;tly beg you will men|tion a &s;ubject no more which is di&s;agree|able to me even to think of.</P>
<P>Poh, poh, Mi&s;s Seymour; upon my word you are ab&s;olutely cruel. However I a&s;&s;ure you I won't carry this me&s;&s;age, which I know would be a death warrant to the Captain's hopes. I have known
<PB N="172" REF="175">
many a young lady change her mind after declaring her&s;elf ten times more violently determined than you are, and I hope to &s;ee you alter your re&s;olution one day in his favour. Indeed if you per&s;i&s;t in pre|cluding him from all chance of &s;eeing you, how can the young man find op|portunity to plead his cau&s;e. I really think I mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t him. I a&s;&s;ure you he importunes me ince&s;&s;antly for only ten minutes conver&s;ation with you, as if it was more than life to him, and though your heart is hardened, mine is quite melted at his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>If ten minutes conver&s;ation would rid me of his &s;olicitations for ever, &s;aid I, I would certainly puni&s;h my&s;elf &s;o far as to give him that &s;atisfaction; but as I have rea&s;on to imagine it would rather feed than extingui&s;h his hopes, I think it would be as unfair to him as painful to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nay but till you bid him de&s;pair your|&s;elf,
<PB N="173" REF="176">
you may be convinced what I &s;ay will have little effect; and I hope when you &s;ee &s;o fine a young man at your feet, you will find your&s;elf &s;oftened in his fa|vour in &s;pite of your pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured her again and again that my di&s;like and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t him were in&s;urmountable; but &s;he went on with|out the &s;lighte&s;t regard to all I &s;aid, re|peating time when we met, I &s;hould not be able to adhere to my inflexibility.</P>
<P>The return of Fanny relieved me from this fatiguing conver&s;ation. Lady Farn|ford had loaded her with civilities, and almo&s;t forced her to promi&s;e to go back to dinner: Mi&s;s Farnford, on her part, was equally kind, and indeed &s;eems re|&s;olved to become Fanny's intimate friend, without any &s;ort of interchange of affec|tions between them; taking every op|portunity of getting her a&s;ide; and quite un&s;olicited, with the communicative im|prudence of a boarding &s;chool girl, mak|ing
<PB N="174" REF="177">
her the confidant of a thou&s;and little trifling love affairs, or, as &s;he terms them, <HI>flirtations.</HI> The equality of their ages, and the flattery which Mi&s;s Farn|ford &s;o lavi&s;hly employs to gain Fanny's confidence, have cemented a &s;ort of inti|macy between them, though they are too di&s;&s;imilar in di&s;po&s;ition even to receive any real gratification from the &s;ociety of each other.</P>
<P>In the evening Mrs. Hindon being almo&s;t well, and able to walk into the drawing room, one or two of her female friends came in, and were prevailed with to remain to make up a party at whi&s;t. Fanny having got half through a favou|rite novel, took this opportunity of &s;lip|ping up &s;tairs to fini&s;h it; and as I was opening my work box to take out my netting, Mr. Howard drew me a&s;ide from the company. I have got &s;ome|thing to &s;ay to you, Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;aid he, and placed him&s;elf by me on the &s;opha.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178">You mu&s;t know, proceeded he, that your acquaintance Mr. Roat&s;ley, (I co|loured at the name) told me la&s;t night at the opera that if I was at lei&s;ure this morning he would call about twelve, as he wi&s;hed extremely to have a few mi|nutes conver&s;ation with me in private, and this day he kept his appointment.</P>
<P>Oh Sophia! how your Hermione's heart beat at this information, Mr. Howard too looked earne&s;t and grave. The lights however were at &s;ome di&s;tance, and I hope my confu&s;ion was unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley, continued Mr. How|ard, with the politene&s;s natural to him apologized with &s;ome little embarra&s;&s;|ment for the liberty he &s;aid he was about to take.</P>
<P>Do you think, Sophia, that I was not embarra&s;&s;ed at this preamble. Indeed I dare not acknowledge even to my&s;elf what ab&s;urd notions were at that in&s;tant crouding into my thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="179">Mr. Howard went on. He then ex|plained to me, &s;aid he, a very intricate &s;eries of iniquity, with which I would not &s;hock your ears, did I not conceive it as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to put you on your guard.</P>
<P>Good heavens, cried I, what are you going to tell me?</P>
<P>You have no rea&s;on thank God, an|&s;wered he, to &s;uffer now any apprehen|&s;ions, as the danger is at an end; but I cannot call to mind that my own impru|dence was the original cau&s;e of the inju|rious reports, without the utmo&s;t &s;elf-re|proach. I think no man can be more &s;en&s;ible than my&s;elf of the value and im|portance of my charge, yet I own I com|mitted the mo&s;t unpardonable over&s;ight in allowing you and your &s;i&s;ter to remain for a week under the roof of a woman of who&s;e character I was not perfectly in|formed.</P>
<P>Her appearance indeed was &s;o plau&s;i|ble, and your &s;tay to be &s;o &s;hort, that I
<PB N="177" REF="180">
took it on tru&s;t, nor once harboured a &s;u&s;picion of her being what &s;he has proved&mdash;one of the mo&s;t abandoned and profligate of her &s;ex: a wretch entirely dive&s;ted of honour and con&s;cience, who has had the audacity and wickedne&s;s to traffic with your reputation, and who perceiving you had kindled the pre&s;ump|tuous wi&s;hes of a libertine, dared to re|pre&s;ent you to him in the mo&s;t doubtful, nay in the mo&s;t infamous light, in order, by flattering his licentious hopes, to reap the lucrative fruits of his folly and pro|digality.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear Sir, interrupted I in a tone of impatient vexation, let us return to &s;olitude and ob&s;curity, where, though li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s may intrude and languor invade our quiet, danger and mortification never can mole&s;t us. How unju&s;t have I not been to the cautious experience of my dear father, in &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pecting he had repre&s;ented the world and its falla|cious
<PB N="178" REF="181">
charms through that medium with which calamity and di&s;appointment ever inve&s;t the face of nature. I am now fa|tally convinced that the plea&s;ures of &s;o|ciety fade and di&s;appear when oppo&s;ed to the &s;nares, anxieties, and di&s;gu&s;ts, which &s;our and taint all its enjoyments.</P>
<P>You are too young, and much too amiable, returned Mr. Howard, &s;miling at my impetuo&s;ity, to become a cynic &s;o early upon tho&s;e whom nature has formed to adorn &s;ociety as well as to improve it. The world has powerful claims; and Mi&s;s Seymour mu&s;t not talk of di&s;gu&s;t becau&s;e a temporary mortification ob|&s;cures for a moment the many rational enjoyments which it offers to every well-regulated mind. But you mu&s;t allow me to go on with my &s;tory.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley, after expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the warme&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms of both the amiable &s;i&s;ters, confe&s;&s;ed that he had been infinitely &s;hocked and a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<PB N="179" REF="182">
to learn, immediately almo&s;t on his arrival in town, that they were re|garded in a very injurious light by his friend Captain Brad&s;haw, who from re|&s;iding under the &s;ame roof had apparently acce&s;s to proper information, and had received <HI>his</HI> from the woman of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley confidently a&s;&s;erted the fal&s;hood of the&s;e defamatory &s;u&s;picions, and reque&s;ted his friend to be more par|ticular in his enquiries, and to talk again with the landlady, who when interrogated &s;till continued to in&s;inuate that you were not altogether what you appeared. Mr. Roat&s;ley however was not &s;o weak as to allow his judgment to be bia&s;&s;ed by this report, nor was he lead for a moment to do you inju&s;tice, although he found that rumours to your di&s;advantage were pre&s;&s;ed on him from more quarters than one; all originating no doubt from the &s;ame &s;ource; till one evening at the play, when he confe&s;&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="183">Oh! repeat it not to me, dear Sir, cried I; I know too well that it was quite natural for him to think me light, thought|le&s;s, and imprudent, when he beheld me at Drury lane attended by the wretch, whom I then found out to be Captain Farnford, and to all appearance volunta|rily receiving his attentions: an accident which my indi&s;po&s;ition alone occa&s;ioned; for you may believe no inducement on earth, had I been in a &s;ituation to have repul&s;ed him, &s;hould have forced me to have granted him the &s;hadow of my no|tice.</P>
<P>Well, Mi&s;s Seymour, thoughtle&s;s and imprudent I really believe he might con|clude you to be, nor could he po&s;&s;ibly think otherwi&s;e, ignorant as he was of the circum&s;tances that produced Farnford's attendance, and con&s;cious of the ju&s;t cau&s;e he had given you for repugnance and di&s;dain. He &s;aw you together in the fame party, and it &s;eems &s;upported by him
<PB N="181" REF="184">
when you left the box. He could not but imagine you had permitted all this, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed your re&s;entment neither &s;o la&s;ting nor &s;o &s;evere as in &s;trict delicacy he thought it ought to have been. Yet Mr. Roat&s;ley &s;olemnly &s;wore, that to the di&s;advantage of your reputation a doubt or &s;u&s;picion never once found place in his brea&s;t; and tho' wholly ignorant my&s;elf of the circum|&s;tances of the fact, I ea&s;ily convinced him that in a point of delicacy Mi&s;s Sey|mour could not po&s;&s;ibly be found in the &s;lighte&s;t degree deficient.</P>
<P>That intere&s;t, however, which youth and beauty &s;eldom fail to excite in the heart of a young man, (a &s;entiment, added he with a half &s;mile, which Mr. Roat&s;ley &s;eems formed to feel with en|thu&s;ia&s;tic force) made him undergo no little di&s;appointment I conjecture in per|ceiving you had &s;o ill an&s;wered the expec|tation to which your acquaintance, inte|re&s;ting

tho' &s;hort, had given birth; for he confe&s;&s;ed that he had been indefati|gable in his enquiries about you, tho' very fruitle&s;s you may believe they mu&s;t have proved; and tho' I under&s;tood the hint in this avowal; I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity, and there|fore let it pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P>He owns, however, that the&s;e unju&s;t &s;urmizes received &s;ome degree of credi|bility from meeting you a few days after, accompanied by this &s;ame audacious young man, who put you into a chair, unattended by your &s;ervant, at the door of your former lodgings; but this part of his information I per&s;i&s;ted in averring was impo&s;&s;ible, and that he mu&s;t have mi&s;taken &s;ome other per&s;on for you.</P>
<P>Oh it was me indeed, cried I, and the rencontre you may be certain gave me equal pain and terror: nor &s;hould I have concealed it for a moment, had not the wretch extorted a promi&s;e which fear
<PB N="183" REF="186">
alone per&s;uaded me to grant him never to divulge it to you.</P>
<P>Good heaven! how did the &s;coundrel contrive to meet with you?</P>
<P>Through the connivance of that wicked woman, &s;aid I. But as my pro|mi&s;e, tho' con&s;trained, remains &s;till in force, except as to that part of it which chance has informed you, I am not at liberty to give you the particulars, nei|ther are they at all nece&s;&s;ary; &s;ince I hope in God, as the wretch is quite undeceived in regard to my character, I have nothing now to alarm me except the per&s;ecution of &s;olicitation, which I hope by &s;edu|lou&s;ly avoiding him to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard's mild countenance red|dened with indignation at this account, which quickly infu&s;ed an apprehen&s;ion into my mind, that under the character of our guardian he might think it nece&s;|&s;ary to re&s;ent my affronts. The in&s;tant this idea &s;truck me, I &s;oftened as much
<PB N="184" REF="187">
as po&s;&s;ible what I had ju&s;t been acknow|ledging, and a&s;&s;ured him that during our la&s;t interview Farnford had appeared &s;o much piqued and offended at my uncon|querable re&s;erve, that I had rea&s;on to flat|ter my&s;elf I &s;hould be tormented by him no more; and added, that when I was entirely in his power, all he had a&s;ked was forgivene&s;s, and permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it me, having repeatedly &s;worn that an in|jurious &s;u&s;picion of my character had alone given ri&s;e to a conduct which he now &s;incerely abjured, and of which he heartily repented.</P>
<P>Let him then te&s;tify his concern and regret as he ought, by avoiding your pre|&s;ence, &s;aid Mr. Howard. Had I known the other day that I was at the &s;ame table with the man who had dared &s;ubject you to in&s;ult, I &s;hould mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly&mdash;</P>
<P>Then thank heaven you did not, inter|rupted I. Indeed the le&s;s this affair is mentioned or remembered the better;
<PB N="185" REF="188">
and before you leave me I in&s;i&s;t on your promi&s;e never even to hint to Captain Farnford your knowledge of the&s;e parti|culars. I a&s;k it as a favour, the grant of which is e&s;&s;ential to my peace. You need not, I am &s;ure, be told how deli|cate an interference of this kind mu&s;t prove, where my fame and my repo&s;e are &s;o deeply intere&s;ted. Let me be&s;eech you therefore to give me your word ne|ver to take notice to Captain Farnford of what you have been informed.</P>
<P>I need not at lea&s;t be told, &s;aid he with gravity, that the title by which I &s;hould in that ca&s;e act might be ju&s;tly called in que&s;tion; but as I have the happine&s;s at pre&s;ent of con&s;idering you as being under my particular protection, tho' I hope that you will &s;oon experience a parent's care, you mu&s;t not in&s;i&s;t on binding me from acting as circum&s;tances may in fu|ture require. I agree &s;o entirely in your &s;entiments however, as to the delicacy
<PB N="186" REF="189">
of this matter, that you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured while the wretch mole&s;ts you no more I &s;hall not interfere, though I &s;hould have the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction in cha&s;|ti&s;ing him for his impudence.</P>
<P>But I have not done with my di&s;agree|able explanation, Mi&s;s Seymour, conti|nued Mr. Howard, and your acute &s;en|&s;ibility almo&s;t intimidates me from con|fe&s;&s;ing all to you, &s;ince I am afraid what I am going to add mu&s;t wound in a &s;till more vulnerable part; for I am well aware that to a youthful and enthu&s;ia&s;tic heart, no blow is &s;o painful, no pang is &s;o &s;evere, as to be told it has be&s;towed its affections unworthily.</P>
<P>The&s;e words threw me into a &s;tate of confu&s;ed con&s;ternation not to be de&s;cribed, and dyed my cheeks with blu&s;hes: for indeed my imagination hurried me in an in&s;tant into a thou&s;and wild conjectures; the truth however after a moment ru&s;hed upon my mind. You need not fear to
<PB N="187" REF="190">
alarm me as to this part of your infor|mation, cried I, for it is no &s;ecret to me; and the &s;hock, tho' at fir&s;t extremely di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, received its cure in the re&s;ent|ment and indignation which treatment &s;o abominable excited. It is of Mrs. Wel|don I perceive you are going to &s;peak; but tho' I am in part acquainted with the artifice and duplicity of her character, a my&s;tery &s;urrounds her &s;ituation through which I have not been able to penetrate. I then briefly related the alarming &s;itua|tion into which that horrid woman had &s;o artfully drawn me, and the fortunate circum&s;tances that had relieved me from my danger. Mr. Howard was lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment at my recital, and &s;huddered on reflecting how critical the &s;nare might have proved in which this infamous wo|man had &s;o inhumanly entrapped me.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley, &s;aid he, has let me into the particulars of her hi&s;tory, which are well known, and have made no &s;mall

noi&s;e; tho' from her change of name I never could have &s;u&s;pected that Mrs. Weldon was the famous Mrs. Brereton, who&s;e imprudence has long been no &s;ecret to the world.</P>
<P>Good heavens! cried I, how then could &s;uch a woman find admittance to the a|bode of Madame de Clarence. Has &s;he too been deceived by her artifices?</P>
<P>I believe it is not unknown to you, re|turned he, that among the number of Mon&s;ieur de Clarence's good qualities, tho&s;e of attachment to his amiable lady, and a proper di&s;charge of dome&s;tic du|ties, are not to be enumerated. Mrs. Weldon appeared at the chateau as his friend, nor did Madame &s;u&s;pect that un|der that &s;pecious character, &s;he had har|boured her mo&s;t invidious enemy; till about the time of your departure from Languedoc, or immediately after it.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard then informed me more particularly of this profligate woman's
<PB N="189" REF="194">
real hi&s;tory. She was, it &s;eems, origi|nally a girl of low birth, who&s;e name was Ware, and who&s;e uncommon beauty induced Colonel Brereton, at the age of &s;ixty five, to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her, having become violently enamoured from accidentally meeting with her at an a&s;|&s;embly while his regiment was quartered at York. This gentleman, though of a very limited under&s;tanding, as may be concluded from his conduct on this im|prudent occa&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an affluent fortune, and was nearly related to Lord Belmont. His lady's ta&s;te for gallantry became &s;oon &s;u&s;pected, and at la&s;t grew &s;o notorious, that finding her&s;elf gradu|ally de&s;erted by that brilliant circle to which her marriage had introduced her, and to charm and embelli&s;h which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o powerfully every talent, &s;he per&s;uaded her hu&s;band, ever blind to his di&s;honour and infatuated by her in&s;inua|ting addre&s;s, to carry her over to France,
<PB N="190" REF="195">
where her amours, though well known, were le&s;s prejudicial to her gay career, becau&s;e unproductive of the world's con|tempt, at lea&s;t the fa&s;hionable part of it, and unattended by its de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Her hu&s;band, dying about a twelve-month after, bequeathed her his whole fortune, the greate&s;t part of which had already fallen a &s;acrifice to her unbounded extravagance. Mr. Brereton's natural heir, however, at pre&s;ent di&s;putes at law the portion of it that remains, alledging that from &s;ome private entail he was not empowered to di&s;po&s;e of it at plea&s;ure; and it is thought the lady will be legally deprived of an inheritance which &s;he &s;o little de&s;erves, and which &s;he gained merely by the effects of her artful ma|nagement, and the powerful influence &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over her &s;uperannuated hu&s;band.</P>
<P>After Mr. Brereton's death, his wife's conduct became &s;o flagrant as to force tho&s;e who had been hitherto willingly
<PB N="191" REF="196">
blind to her infamy no longer to &s;hut their eyes, and as a proper regard to the rules of propriety is a tax which virtue never more rigorou&s;ly exacts from vice than where her genuine and intrin&s;ic va|lue is lea&s;t admitted, &s;he &s;oon found her &s;tay in France could not enable her to continue in that brilliant &s;ociety where &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;hine with &s;uch eclat. At this period, her ac|quaintance with Mon&s;ieur de Clarence commenced while he &s;pent &s;ome time at the city of M&mdash; for the recovery of his health, whither his lady had not accom|panied him.</P>
<P>He &s;oon became en&s;laved by the charms of Mrs. Brereton, and weakly con&s;ented to her reque&s;t of being invited to the re&s;idence of his lady at the Chateau de Clarence, on the footing of a friend recommended to his peculiar care by her decea&s;ed hu&s;band. Madame de Cla|rence was ea&s;ily deceived; and without
<PB N="192" REF="197">
difficulty con&s;ented to entreat the favour of a vi&s;it from his agreeable Engli&s;h ac|quaintance, who on her part regarding it as an ingenious &s;troke of policy to re|gain in &s;ome mea&s;ure the good opinion of the world, to whom &s;he might boa&s;t being &s;till admitted into an intimacy &s;o re&s;pectable, complied with eagerne&s;s and &s;atisfaction. The company of the Che|valier de Mertane &s;oon, however, inter|rupted the harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween Mon&s;ieur de Clarence and Mrs. Weldon, (for &s;uch was the name &s;he now cho&s;e to a&s;&s;ume, probably from an ap|prehen&s;ion that the imprudence of Mrs. Brereton might not be wholly unknown even to Madame de Clarence, whil&s;t un|der a borrowed name &s;he might be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on.) The youth and weakne&s;s of the Chevalier almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;ug|ge&s;ted to that abandoned woman the hopes of repairing her injured reputation and her exhau&s;ted finances, by an union,
<PB N="193" REF="198">
the rank and opulence of which offered both to her vanity and profu&s;ion the mo&s;t ample gratification.</P>
<P>This explanation fully accounts for the mortification and di&s;plea&s;ure, too painful for concealment, which &s;he &s;o evidently di&s;covered on perceiving the Chevalier's partiality for me. He was not however proof again&s;t her powers of fa&s;cination; and after my determined rejection, accepted with great cordiality the con&s;olation which Mrs. Weldon's kindne&s;s afforded. He was indeed almo&s;t involved in this perilous &s;nare, when the fortunate jealou&s;y of Mon&s;ieur de Cla|rence happily relieved him from his dan|ger. That gentleman, influenced either by pique or principle, or perhaps by both, &s;uddenly informed the Chevalier's father of the &s;on's matrimonial intentions, as al&s;o with &s;ome particulars relating to the lady's character, which induced the old gentleman to appear unexpectedly
<PB N="194" REF="199">
one morning at the chateau, from whence he carried off the Chevalier without al|lowing him the ceremonial of a private farewell conference with his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>From more circum&s;tances than one both Mr. Howard and I perceived that this affair mu&s;t have been in agitation during the time of our abode in the fa|mily; for the poor Chevalier's depar|ture &s;ucceeded ours but a few days, and it &s;eems a thorough reconciliation having immediately taken place between Mrs. Weldon and Mon&s;ieur de Clarence, their mutual imprudence &s;oon infu&s;ed &s;u&s;pi|cions into Madame which induced her to in&s;i&s;t upon that lady's in&s;tant di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion. To this demand the hu&s;band, unwilling to come to an open rupture with Madame, who&s;e family and con|nections demand peculiar re&s;pect, con|&s;ented; and Mrs. Weldon's law&s;uit re|quiring her pre&s;ence in England, &s;he &s;et off directly for this country.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="200">I was actually frozen with horror on learning this account. Good heavens! exclaimed I, does &s;uch a character of vice and duplicity exi&s;t, and can it belong to woman?</P>
<P>Oh! Mi&s;s Seymour, returned Mr. Howard, a mind like yours, delicate and pure, ble&s;&s;ed with con&s;cious innocence and fortified with intuitive integrity, can form no ideas adequate to that degrada|tion to which licentiou&s;ne&s;s and profligacy often reduce the female mind; but to dwell no longer on a theme &s;o melan|choly, I mu&s;t inform you, that after having related the&s;e particulars, which Mr. Roat&s;ley had received from a friend lately arrived from the Continent, and intimately acquainted with the parties concerned, he confe&s;&s;ed how inexpre&s;&s;ibly confounded and a&s;toni&s;hed he had been on perceiving you the morning before la&s;t &s;tanding at the window of a hou&s;e which he had been told was occupied by
<PB N="196" REF="201">
his unworthy relation; and &s;till more was he &s;hocked, when at a &s;econd glance, he recollected Mrs. Brereton her&s;elf, who&s;e features he in&s;tantly recognized, though it is many years &s;ince he beheld her. Scarcely could he credit his &s;en&s;es. Yet &s;o &s;trongly did the dignity and innocence of your countenance contradict this con|firmation of your levity, that in&s;tead of convincing it awakened him from his error. Imprudent he might believe you, but infamous it was impo&s;&s;ible he could for an in&s;tant &s;u&s;pect you to be; and upon revolving the circum&s;tances in his mind, it in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;truck him that the daring Farnford mu&s;t have bribed that infamous woman to entrap you to her hou&s;e. This idea no &s;ooner occurred, than a thou&s;and circum&s;tances &s;eemed to enforce its conviction. Farnford's cha|racter, which though un&s;tained by actual villany, is loo&s;e and unprincipled, a&s;&s;ured him he would not be &s;crupulous in ef|fecting
<PB N="197" REF="202">
his ends by whatever means in his power. He knew be&s;ides that the woman was in his pay, and to lay him under further contributions, &s;he might be induced to mi&s;repre&s;ent your beha|viour, con&s;cious that the knowledge of your being a woman of rank and charac|ter mu&s;t have checked his hopes and re|&s;trained his liberality to her&s;elf. Mr. Roat&s;ley began to &s;u&s;pect that your ac|quaintance with Mrs. Weldon might have originated al&s;o from &s;ome &s;uch ma|chinations, and he in&s;tantly determined to acquaint me with his &s;u&s;picions; and having enquired at our old lodgings for our pre&s;ent re&s;idence with the eagerne&s;s of a man of honour anxious to &s;ecure virtue and innocence from de&s;truction, he ha&s;tened to this hou&s;e without lo&s;s of time; for me only he enquired, for to me only could &s;o delicate an explanation be made, but I was unluckily from home. Next morning he repeated his vi&s;it, but
<PB N="198" REF="203">
being engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, he was denied admittance. On his return home, how|ever, he encountered a gentleman with whom he is particularly intimate, and who in the confidence of friend&s;hip con|fe&s;&s;ed to him how amazed he had been to meet with a young lady not only of the mo&s;t elegant but of the mo&s;t innocent and amiable appearance at the hou&s;e of his profligate relation, Mrs. Weldon, who from being now notoriou&s;ly infamous, was wholly excluded all honourable &s;o|ciety: his friend added, that this aban|doned woman had repre&s;ented the young lady, who&s;e name was Seymour, as a girl of light character and dependant for|tune, but having been more than once in her company, this injurious error had appeared to him &s;o apparent, that he had thought it incumbent on him to atone for it by repre&s;enting to her the hazards of her &s;ituation, an information that had operated &s;o violently on her &s;pirits as
<PB N="199" REF="204">
fully convinced him how entirely &s;he mu&s;t have been deceived as to the character of her companion.</P>
<P>Amiable, generous Roat&s;ley! May not I call the man &s;o, my Sophia, who has &s;o humanely intere&s;ted him&s;elf in my affairs. How many, in a &s;imilar &s;itua|tion, would have contented them&s;elves with leaving me to my fate, e&s;pecially after that perplexed &s;eries of unfortunate events, which might have too ju&s;tly led him to regard me with contempt; how few would have given them&s;elves the trouble of inve&s;tigating this matter to the foundation, and exerted them&s;elves in a manner &s;o nobly, to extricate a young woman who&s;e conduct he had &s;o much rea&s;on to contemn, and who had been repre&s;ented to him in a light &s;o unwor|thy. Surely gratitude at lea&s;t may be allowed me after this &s;triking in&s;tance of a benevolence of which I have reaped &s;o largely the fruit: yet heaven grant that
<PB N="200" REF="205">
this dangerous &s;entiment lead not my heart too far. Vexatious it has in|deed proved; but ah! Sophia, had not heaven directed and pre&s;erved me, this intelligence had arrived greatly too late.</P>
<P>The whi&s;t party breaking up, and &s;up|per being announced, Mr. Howard &s;eized an opportunity, while we were on the &s;tairs, to whi&s;per that Mr. Roat&s;ley re|gretted extremely not having &s;een my &s;i&s;ter and me this morning, when he had called, particularly as he leaves town to|morrow, and is engaged by bu&s;ine&s;s the early part of the day. Mr. Howard how|ever, who was not &s;ufficiently acquainted with many of the unaccountable facts to which Mr. Roat&s;ley's &s;tory alluded, and was only enabled, from his knowledge of my di&s;po&s;ition and character, to pro|nounce that &s;ome my&s;terious appearances mu&s;t have involved my actions in ob|&s;curity, had of his own accord offered

<P>Ah! my dear Sophia! how infinitely am I &s;hocked. Poor Madame de Cla|rence! alas! &s;he is no more! A &s;hort letter from her hu&s;band, which I received la&s;t night, announces this melancholy in|telligence. An epidemic fever carried her off after a week's illne&s;s, and Fanny and I have been weeping her irreparable lo&s;s with tears of bitter affliction. A friend&mdash;a maternal friend! re&s;pected and beloved, is a ble&s;&s;ing which heaven &s;ends but once in our lives, and to us can ne|ver be &s;upplied. In our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, this blow cannot fail to be felt with re|doubled poignancy. There now remains not to us one &s;ingle friend of our own

<P>Captain Wilmot had been, as u&s;ual, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation ye&s;terday evening
<PB N="206" REF="211">
with Fanny, who while &s;he pretends to laugh at his ab&s;urdities always appears plea&s;ed with his a&s;&s;iduities. He had been repeating to her a number of ver&s;es, all on the &s;oft &s;ubject of love, which he informed her were the effu&s;ions of his own pa&s;&s;ion that had in&s;pired him with a poetical ardour. Of one of the&s;e Fanny incon&s;iderately reque&s;ted a copy, not re|flecting that to demand a poem, of which &s;he was her&s;elf the theme, confe&s;&s;ed no little &s;atisfaction at the compliment.

<P>Fanny having no opportunity to pe|ru&s;e the &s;tanzas, &s;lipped them into her pocket, from whence &s;he drew them the moment we retired after &s;upper: when conceive her a&s;toni&s;hment on finding the copy of ver&s;es converted into a letter di|rected

<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CAPTAIN WILMOT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR WILMOT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your epi&s;tle arrived very opportunely to rou&s;e me from a &s;tupor that has con|gealed and benumbed all my faculties ever &s;ince we were ordered to this con|founded quarter, which is undoubtedly the dulle&s;t &s;pot under heaven, and which Providence &s;eems to have &s;tamped with an impre&s;&s;ion of gloom, and la&s;&s;itude not to be expre&s;&s;ed. There is not a &s;oul in the town with whom one can a&s;&s;ociate with any degree of &s;atisfaction. The very girls are as ugly as devils; and
<PB N="208" REF="213">
what is &s;till wor&s;e, as mo&s;t of the offi|cers are either on furlow or ab&s;ent on recruiting duty, there are none here ex|cept Wil&s;on and the Major; and the latter is &s;o con&s;tantly immured amid&s;t a library of mu&s;ty old folios, that it is merely at me&s;s hours we ever &s;et eyes upon him.</P>
<P>I am extremely happy to learn, from your letter, that the time which hung &s;o heavily on my hands, <HI>you</HI> have been employing &s;o much to your &s;atisfaction and advantage. From the account you give me of your Dulcinea, I agree with you in opinion that &s;he will not hold out the &s;iege much l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nger, when to your own a&s;&s;iduities are &s;uperadded the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and &s;olicitations of your aunt, who being a di&s;creet matron may give an air of credit and propriety to a &s;tep which, with all due deference, you mu&s;t allow me to call imprudent, as I &s;u&s;pect the fortune of the beautiful Seymour is no

le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the rapacious demands of your creditors, than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the young lady her&s;elf is to the claims of your pa&s;&s;ion; but I &s;incerely hope, thro' the prudent management of Mrs. Hin|don, &s;he has no chance of being made acquainted with the&s;e di&s;agreeable and <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> particulars till the information can be attended with no alarming con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, Wilmot, that for one &s;o <HI>deeply</HI> enamoured you talk very <HI>rea&s;onably</HI> on the topic of your mi&s;tre&s;s; and though you tell me &s;he is divine, you evidently prefer expatiating on her more &s;ub&s;tantial attractions. You retail, indeed, her pro&s;pects and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with the accuracy of an army agent.</P>
<P>I hope, by this time, you have brought matters to a happy conclu&s;ion. Indeed, as your affairs are at pre&s;ent &s;ituated, no time is to be lo&s;t. Fortune does not throw a gift of ten thou&s;and pounds into
<PB N="210" REF="215">
the arms of a &s;oldier every day; and you may rea&s;onably conclude that the grand|father will not be &s;o ea&s;ily <HI>melted to compliance,</HI> as you tell me the girl her|&s;elf has been, nor can you flatter your|&s;elf his Lord&s;hip will prove &s;o wholly influenced by di&s;intere&s;ted &s;entiments as to remain contentedly ignorant of your &s;ituation re&s;pecting pecuniary matters. His interference would effectually blow up the whole &s;cheme; and if your point is not &s;ettled pa&s;t redemption before his return, you may hang your&s;elf on the fir&s;t willow you meet with between Lon|don and Coventry.</P>
<P>I can't help laughing at the difficul|ties you mu&s;t have to encounter in court|ing your fair one under the eye of your old flame Jenny Par&s;ons. This untoward circum&s;tance mu&s;t throw a con&s;traint over your behaviour and addre&s;s, by no means favourable to your de&s;ire of plea&s;|ing: yet to have fulfilled your engage|ments
<PB N="211" REF="216">
in that quarter mu&s;t have proved unmitigated ruin to both; and &s;he is &s;o &s;oft, poor gentle &s;oul, that if ever a de|&s;erted mi&s;tre&s;s was to be tru&s;ted where retaliation was in her power, I dare &s;ay Mi&s;s Par&s;ons might be the woman. Con&s;ider it entirely re&s;ts with her to overturn the whole machine of your in|genious &s;cheme. You tell me you have been &s;o prudent that you are convinced &s;he does not even &s;u&s;pect your intentions; and that your management could not have been di&s;cernable even to the eye of jealou&s;y. Remember, however, that re|venge is a ruling pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;ex; nor are they ever to be tru&s;ted where offended pride mu&s;t &s;timulate to vengeance.</P>
<P>Heartily wi&s;hing you all the &s;ucce&s;s you can wi&s;h, and reque&s;ting to be im|mediately made acquainted with it, I conclude, with my caution, as above; and remain, dear Wilmot,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="212" REF="217">You may ea&s;ily judge how confounded Fanny mu&s;t be to perceive by this letter, &s;o wonderfully pre&s;ented to her know|ledge, that with all his timidity and dif|fident de&s;ire of ingratiating him&s;elf, Wil|mot regarded his &s;olicitations as certain of &s;ucce&s;s, and had communicated his expectations to his friend with all the vanity of a man who did not allow him|&s;elf even to doubt.</P>
<P>I was employed la&s;t night pretty late, and was &s;till reading in my dre&s;&s;ing room, when my &s;i&s;ter, who I concluded was gone to bed, flew to me with the epi&s;tle in her hand, with a countenance as pale as death, in which mortification, anger, and a&s;toni&s;hment were &s;trongly painted. She informed me of the accident; and as tears are a relief which Fanny has ever at hand, her gentle di&s;po&s;ition al|lowing of no other vent to her indigna|tion, &s;he could not help crying from
<PB N="213" REF="218">
vexation, while &s;he entreated me to read it.</P>
<P>The part of it, however, which pro|voked her mo&s;t, was that humiliating &s;entence where Wilmot appears to have boa&s;ted to his corre&s;pondent that &s;he had been very <HI>ea&s;ily melted to compliance,</HI> a phraze that &s;everely wounded her pride. You &s;ee, cried &s;he, he has never once mentioned me. I dare &s;ay he never thought about me. 'Tis my fortune alone about which he is &s;o anxious. No doubt it would have been of &s;ome &s;er|vice in advancing him in his profe&s;&s;ion; but God knows, had he been informed how matters &s;tand, he never would have paid me his addre&s;&s;es on account of an advantage which no longer exi&s;ts, and he is both weak and vain if he concludes I have been &s;o <HI>ea&s;ily melted</HI> as he flattered him&s;elf, or that I have li&s;tened with plea&s;ure to &s;olicitations which have fa|tigued
<PB N="214" REF="219">
and tormented me ever &s;ince our re&s;idence in this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Solicitations, Fanny, cried I; I never knew till this moment that Wilmot had made any advances that could go under the name of &s;olicitations. Strange in|deed, if I have continued thus long ig|norant of any part of his behaviour, yet certain I am you have never once hinted to me any thing which could be con&s;trued into that meaning.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear Hermione! exclaimed &s;he, burning into a fre&s;h flood of tears, I will tell you all.</P>
<P>All! cried I, terrified at the expre&s;|&s;ion, what is the <HI>all</HI> of which you are to inform me? for indeed I &s;u&s;pected &s;ome frightful imprudence from the agitation in which I beheld her.</P>
<P>She could not, however, immediately relieve my fears, and tears of mortifica|tion choaked her utterance.</P>
<P>Oh! cried &s;he at length, how can I
<PB N="215" REF="220">
tell you; you, that are older and &s;o much wi&s;er than I, you will think meanly of me, and I would &s;ooner lo&s;e the good opinion of the whole world than be de|&s;pi&s;ed by you.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Fanny, &s;aid I in the ten|dere&s;t accents, you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that is impo&s;&s;ible. My knowledge of your heart mu&s;t ever conceal and exte|nuate all your little errors, and it is un|kind in you to imagine that mine could for an in&s;tant harbour a &s;entiment &s;o in|jurious of which you were the object.</P>
<P>She then confe&s;&s;ed to me that about ten days ago Wilmot had declared his pa&s;&s;ion in the warme&s;t and mo&s;t affecting terms; and though I did not love him, cried &s;he, at lea&s;t I am certain it gave me no pain to reject him on my own ac|count, yet I could not be wholly unmoved at prayers and entreaties which &s;eemed the re&s;ult of the mo&s;t ardent affection; an affection, repeated &s;he, which I now
<PB N="216" REF="221">
plainly perceive my fortune alone in|&s;pired. All however that he de&s;ired, re|mitting his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s to time and a&s;&s;iduity, was that you, whom he appre|hended and whom I well knew not to be in his intere&s;t, &s;hould not for &s;ome time be made acquainted with his propo&s;als; and to this reque&s;t, &s;oftened by his ap|parent di&s;tre&s;s, I was weak enough un|willingly to con&s;ent; though it &s;hocked me extremely that you, who are my only friend and advizer, and to whom every thought of my heart has ever been known, &s;hould continue ignorant of an affair which but for this fortunate di&s;co|very might have intere&s;ted it too much.</P>
<P>As &s;he fini&s;hed &s;peaking, &s;he &s;obbed on my bo&s;om mo&s;t bitterly. You may believe I embraced and &s;oothed her ten|derly. But tell me, my dear, &s;aid I, what further lengths you have been pre|vailed with to go. There are no engage|ments in the ca&s;e I hope.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="222">No, thank God, cried &s;he, though heaven knows how I have been per&s;e|cuted and tormented, not only by Wil|mot him&s;elf but by Mrs. Hindon, who has warmly e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e and pri|vately pleaded his pa&s;&s;ion on every occa|&s;ion when &s;he could get me by my&s;elf; and not having my beloved Hermione to direct me, for they both kept me &s;tea|dily to my ra&s;h promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy, though I often de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to di&s;clo&s;e this affair to you, into what an aby&s;s of mi|&s;ery might I not have been plunged from my folly and inexperience; bewildered by Mrs. Hindon's partial repre&s;entation of this imprudent &s;tep, and &s;oftened by the continual a&s;&s;iduities and de&s;pair of a man who &s;eemed to adore me.</P>
<P>Artful wretches! can I give them, So|phia, a milder appellation? What a plan was here to entrap my amiable, inno|cent, un&s;u&s;pecting Fanny. And becau&s;e my eyes were &s;uppo&s;ed to be open to
<PB N="218" REF="223">
the thou&s;and objections again&s;t a match, in favour of which not one &s;ingle advan|tage can be pre&s;ented, I was to be kept out of the &s;ecret till too late effectually to interfere; whil&s;t my dear and only &s;i&s;ter was to prove a victim to the need and prodigality of the one, and to the ab&s;urd and de&s;tructive vanity of the other.</P>
<P>What a de&s;picable character does this letter plainly prove Wilmot's to be. I am amazed, on looking back, that the whole affair did not occur to my &s;u&s;pi|cion. But the art of the one, and the low cunning of the other, added to my tru&s;t in Fanny's confidence in my advice, all con&s;pired to deceive me. You &s;ee too, there is a hint of a previous engage|ment. Poor Mi&s;s Par&s;ons! her dejec|tion and depre&s;&s;ion are now fully ac|counted for. How hard has been her fate. Deprived of her parents at a pe|riod of life when the feelings are mo&s;t acutely &s;en&s;ible to the &s;hafts of misfor|tune,
<PB N="219" REF="224">
con&s;trained to endure a haughty and indelicate dependance, her affections and her pride had yet a wound more painful to receive, a &s;ting more corroding to undergo. Her &s;ufferings, and her patient forbearance of complaint, endear her to me in the mo&s;t affecting point of view, and I &s;hall now more anxiou&s;ly than ever exert my&s;elf to &s;often her an|gui&s;h, by every kindne&s;s and attention in my power to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>As to my dear Fanny, though this pro|vidential di&s;covery produced a tempo|rary mortification, and drew &s;ome tears of vexation from her eyes, her heart, &s;lightly if at all touched, had nothing deeply to hurt or painfully to intere&s;t it; and as &s;he was thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the ri&s;ques from which &s;he had ju&s;t e&s;caped, &s;he beheld with horror the precipice on which &s;he had been &s;tanding, and re|quired not either argument or per&s;ua&s;ion (though by way of caution I be&s;towed
<PB N="220" REF="225">
both very lavi&s;hly) to convince her how fortunate this accident had proved. Her innocent mind, unacquainted with di&s;|gui&s;e and unu&s;ed to concealment, felt relieved of a painful weight by the con|fe&s;&s;ion which her fir&s;t agitation had ex|torted from her; yet I had no little dif|ficulty in reconciling her to her&s;elf on account of having forfeited her promi&s;e, which indeed &s;he had fal&s;ified almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly in the height of her emo|tions.</P>
<P>Since I have done &s;o, &s;aid &s;he, though I think I have been to blame, do not ex|po&s;e me to Mrs. Hindon. Di&s;honoura|bly as &s;he has acted towards me, I ought not to have receded from the promi&s;e I gave. I ought indeed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both &s;en&s;e and re&s;olution &s;ufficient for acting without coun&s;el; but you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured never, never, &s;hall I ri&s;que my peace by granting another promi&s;e to the &s;ame purport. I have &s;uffered too
<PB N="221" REF="226">
&s;everely from this ill judged concealment, and &s;hall take the fir&s;t opportunity of informing Mrs. Hindon that I am deter|mined in my re&s;olution never again to li&s;ten to her nephew on the &s;ubject, of his pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;never indeed &s;hall he have an opportunity of tormenting me more.</P>
<P>To calm her, I gave her my word I &s;hould not mention one &s;yllable of the matter to Mrs. Hindon. Yet I was &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s how to proceed. To apply to Mr. Howard, was to hazard engaging him in a quarrel with his &s;i&s;ter in law; nor could I my&s;elf re&s;ent her behaviour while we were partaking of her civilities. I re&s;olved therefore to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject; and by never quit|ting Fanny's &s;ide, who her&s;elf wi&s;hed to avoid any intercour&s;e with Wilmot, &s;o to regulate her manner in future as en|tirely to de&s;troy the hopes to which his vanity and her imprudence had given ri&s;e.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I was this day favored with an an&s;wer from Nice, and I delay not a moment in

acquainting you with the re&s;ult of your application, although I am extremely &s;orry to premi&s;e that it is not of a nature that can either prove agreeable to your own wi&s;hes or to tho&s;e of the young la|dies committed to your charge.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the indefatigable trouble I have taken, and the per&s;ua&s;ive arguments I have u&s;ed in more than one letter, to repre&s;ent their &s;ituation in a light the mo&s;t di&s;mal and affecting, his Lord&s;hip remains quite inexorable to all my en|treaties. He tells me that the revival of recollections &s;o bitter, as this &s;ubject re|calls to his memory, has given a mortal &s;tab to that repo&s;e which time had in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored, and he de&s;ires, as he is not at liberty him&s;elf to addre&s;s the la|dies, that through the medium of my pen they may be informed, that when the conduct of their unhappy parent forced him to renounce him, he bound him&s;elf by a &s;olemn re&s;olution it &s;hould

His Lord&s;hip con|cludes by laying his commands upon me, under pain of his perpetual di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;trictly to ob&s;erve a &s;imilar conduct, and expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with a &s;ternne&s;s and force which con&s;trains me, with all the di&s;po&s;ition imaginable to &s;erve the young ladies, to give up all thoughts of mak|ing my&s;elf or family known to them. I hope therefore, after this di&s;agreeable in|formation, which with infinite pain to my&s;elf I am obliged to divulge, they will neither be &s;urpri&s;ed nor offended when I acknowledge that a firm adherence to Lord Belmont's prohibition is the una|voidable con&s;equence of its having been made known; and that I think my&s;elf obliged, after reque&s;ting the favor of one

<P>As I cannot but feel warmly intere&s;ted in two young per&s;ons, who &s;uffer &s;o un|fortunately for errors for which in &s;trict ju&s;tice they cannot be e&s;teemed account|able, I was extremely happy Sir, to un|der&s;tand from you, that your wards la|boured under no difficulties in regard to fortune. I take it for granted therefore that they po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;um which Lord Linro&s;e received from the genero&s;ity of his father, and which I know was reck|oned a very noble &s;tipulation in Lord Belmont to grant after a conduct &s;o weak, di&s;honourable, and irritating to all his friends. Had any pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance been required, I &s;hould certainly have ri&s;qued my Lord's di&s;plea&s;ure by contri|buting from my own private pur&s;e what might have been of &s;ervice for their ea&s;e and comfort; but as this is by no means nece&s;&s;ary, and the ladies are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

of an affluence which allows them to pur|&s;ue what plan of life they chu&s;e, and to &s;ettle wherever they may incline, if I might be allowed to interfere with my advice on this head, I would take the li|berty of &s;ugge&s;ting that France, which may in a manner be called their native country, mu&s;t to them undoubtedly prove a more eligible, as well as a more agree|able re&s;idence than England is ever likely to become. A hint mu&s;t convince them that where the &s;tain of their father's faults is unknown they certainly enjoy a better chance of being re&s;pected, than where remembrance mu&s;t ever &s;ubject them to the impertinence of curio&s;ity, and per|haps, however unju&s;tly, to unmerited contempt.</P>
<P>I approve highly of the mode&s;ty and prudence they have te&s;tified in not a&s;&s;um|ing a name, the renunciation of which was the con&s;equence of family di&s;honor; and I make no doubt they will equally

&s;upport their claim to tho&s;e virtues in fu|ture, by carefully concealing their ti|tle to it.

</LETTER>
<P>Well, Sophia, what do you think of this letter? All our ab&s;urd and romantic hopes, hitherto &s;upported by the chimeras of a &s;anguine and delu&s;ive imagination, are at one blow finally cru&s;hed. No re|dre&s;s you find. A &s;olemn re&s;olution de|prives us even of a flattering po&s;&s;ibility that Lord Belmont, (alas! I dare not give him the tender appellation of grand|father,) may allow nature and compa&s;&s;ion to plead for us in his bo&s;om. He forbids our claims, denies our title to his pro|tection, and breaks with us for ever. Oh! my Sophia, my dear and only friend! our hearts are deeply wounded
<PB N="230" REF="235">
by this &s;troke. Fanny and I have been weeping the lo&s;s of our la&s;t parent in each other's arms; and on this occa&s;ion I have been faithfully acting up to the enco|mium once be&s;towed on me, of in&s;tilling con&s;olation at a moment when I could not my&s;elf imbibe comfort from my own arguments.</P>
<P>We were &s;itting at table with &s;ome company after dinner, when this cruel letter was put into Mr. Howard's hands. He a&s;ked leave to break the &s;eal; and upon ha&s;tily peru&s;ing the fir&s;t lines, changed colour and left the room. My apprehen&s;ions in&s;tantly told me from whence it came, and what were the con|tents; yet I kept my &s;eat in &s;eeming compo&s;ure till Mrs. Hindon withdrew with the ladies to the drawing room.</P>
<P>My impatience then left me no longer re&s;olution to remain in this anxious in|quietude; and unwilling to make Fanny a &s;harer in my unea&s;ine&s;s, I &s;tole &s;oftly
<PB N="231" REF="236">
to Mr. Hindon's &s;tudy, where I con|cluded Mr. Howard would be, and tap|ping at the door, a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to en|ter. He opened it immediately. The di&s;appointment which your countenance cannot conceal, &s;aid I, too evidently ex|plains all I want to know.</P>
<P>Pre&s;&s;ing my hand&mdash;Here is the letter, an&s;wered he. I can &s;ay nothing to miti|gate its unwelcome contents. Yet what bo&s;om can boa&s;t &s;uperior fortitude to Mi&s;s Seymour's, who&s;e mind &s;ugge&s;ts more powerful and alleviating con&s;ola|tions for a misfortune in which neither imprudence nor mi&s;conduct involves her. He then gave me the letter, and walked up &s;tairs to &s;end down Fanny to receive the news.</P>
<P>She found me drowned in tears, which this complete di&s;appointment to all our hopes could not but at fir&s;t produce: but &s;oon that mixture of indelicacy and pre|tended compa&s;&s;ion which the letter con|tained,
<PB N="232" REF="237">
by exciting my re&s;entment forti|fied my &s;pirits. Narrow-minded woman! Does &s;he &s;uppo&s;e all the world influenced by &s;entiments of equal meanne&s;s with her own? does &s;he conclude that reproach and contempt mu&s;t be our portion, be|cau&s;e our parent erred and was unhappy. He &s;uffered, alas, &s;uffciently for his faults, without entailing their mi&s;erable con&s;equences on his offspring, and hea|ven I tru&s;t has accepted the tribute of his remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Pecuniary a&s;&s;istance; oh! may it plea&s;e a wi&s;e and gracious Providence to avert a calamity &s;o in&s;upportable, &s;o degrad|ing as dependence on Lady Linro&s;e would prove. Rather, iny Sophia, let us owe the mere nece&s;&s;aries of exi&s;tence to the hone&s;t labour of our hands. Ah! rake not up the a&s;hes of the dead! Cruel woman; why does &s;he write with a &s;hew of &s;ympathy &s;he feels not, and of pity which borders on in&s;ult, while &s;uch bit|ter

expre&s;&s;ions drop from her pen, (ex|pre&s;&s;ions which &s;he well knew mu&s;t recall the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing reflections) for errors that long &s;ince were expiated and for|given.</P>
<P>Poor Fanny's &s;anguine expectations were &s;o cruelly da&s;hed, and her &s;pirits &s;o &s;unk by this blow, that I found it doubly incumbent on me to exert my own in order to &s;upport hers. I reflected that this di&s;appointment, as &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. Howard, was not the con&s;equence either of our folly or our faults: it was an event I had ever believed po&s;&s;ible, and often feared was probable, nor could it ever have depended on our own conduct to have averted or e&s;caped it. Pride inter|mixed it&s;elf in many motives of con&s;o|lation; and in &s;uch circum&s;tances the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that &s;entiment (in many ca&s;es the error of our nature) is perhaps the mo&s;t &s;alutary &s;ource from which com|fort can flow.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="239">My grandfather's vow, (for &s;till will I call him &s;o) if it cannot be recalled, yet &s;urely extends not to Lady Linro&s;e. Were &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mind noble and en|larged were it not &s;elfi&s;h, little, and in|terested, never would &s;he have given im|plicit obedience to a mea&s;ure &s;o unfeeling and unju&s;t as that of renouncing two friendle&s;s girls, in a foreign country, where they have no claims for kindne&s;s or protection except on tho&s;e whom be|nevolence and humanity induce to be the friends of the unfortunate.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard &s;oon joined us. I was quite compo&s;ed when he entered, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted his arguments &s;o effectually, that Fanny became at length more compo&s;ed; We remained together a con&s;iderable time in conver&s;ation; till at length we were interrupted by the appearance of Mrs. Hindon.</P>
<P>Good &s;tars! in tears my dear ladies, cried &s;he. What on earth can be the
<PB N="235" REF="240">
matter? for God's &s;ake tell me what has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed you in this manner? Brother, what can it be?</P>
<P>On being informed&mdash;God Almighty! cried &s;he, renounce you! Lord Belmont renounce you! What on earth will then become of you, for to my certain know|ledge you will never &s;ee one &s;hilling of the money that was lodged in Mr. Ben&s;|ley's hands.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, cried Mr. How|ard with evident di&s;plea&s;ure, I hope part of it will certainly be recovered.</P>
<P>Part of it&mdash;what perhaps one paltry thou&s;and, or it may be two, out of the twenty-four. That's part of it with a vengeance. What will two thou&s;and be to them, who have been accu&s;tomed to want for nothing, and to have things al|ways hand&s;ome and genteel about them. Indeed it is mo&s;t deplorable. But pray Mi&s;s Seymour if you was your&s;elf to write to Lady Linro&s;e, for you know you are
<PB N="236" REF="241">
extremely clever at your pen, and was to repre&s;ent your de&s;titute condition in the mo&s;t moving terms, don't you think &s;he might be prevailed on to intercede with Lord Belmont to allow you &s;omething yearly, or in ca&s;e that failed to grant it her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Not for a thou&s;and worlds! cried I. If our afffirs are in this di&s;mal &s;ituation, we mu&s;t accu&s;tom our&s;elves to conform to our finances. It is a duty to live within the limits of what one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; the di&s;charge of which is I think as e&s;|&s;ential as that of almo&s;t any other. To apply to any of our family after this re|nunciation, is what I never will for an in&s;tant think of.</P>
<P>And why not pray? cried &s;he. Fine talking indeed, of living like &s;crubs on fifty pounds a year, after having been brought up to forty times that &s;um, when a &s;tep &s;o natural and &s;imple might be&s;tow affluence and comfort in&s;tead of
<PB N="237" REF="242">
penury and want. Tis nothing but pride, mere pride, which prevents you fronn following my advice, and indeed you mu&s;t allow me to tell you &s;o; be|&s;ides, as you have &s;uch certain proofs by which to a&s;certain your birth, if you make but bu&s;tle enough, I dare &s;ay his Lord&s;hip will be glad to compound mat|ters from the dread of your reviving the old &s;tory by going to law with him; or if he won't be brought to hear rea&s;on, what do you think of actually commenc|ing a proce&s;s. I'll warrant the bare idea of &s;uch a proceeding will bring him to act as he ought to do. What &s;ay you brother to the &s;cheme?</P>
<P>I would rather &s;tarve, cried I with a warmth which her indelicacy made irre|pre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Starve! Fine talking to be &s;ure. I'll wager Mr. Howard agrees with me, if people wont be per&s;uaded to behave pro|perly why they mu&s;t be compelled to it if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="243">I cannot agree wich you in this mea|&s;ure, indeed Madam, &s;aid Mr. Howard, who &s;eemed to have been lo&s;t in thought ever &s;ince her entrance, for I cannot po&s;|&s;ibly conceive what advantage could re|&s;ult from Lord Belmont's being con|&s;trained to acknowledge his grandchil|dren: but it is impo&s;&s;ible immediately to determine what &s;teps ought to be pur|&s;ued.</P>
<P>Oh to be &s;ure one ought to con&s;ider certainly, and I make no doubt you will agree with me in opinion that &s;ome &s;ort of application ought immediately to be made to Lady Linro&s;e. But I have le&s;t my company below. Will you make your appearance ladies; or if you are not &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed I &s;hall &s;end up Jenny wich tea, for Lady Farnford and her daughter are ju&s;t come in and will be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>She then le&s;t us: and I be&s;ought Mr. Howard no longer to conceal any circum|&s;tances
<PB N="239" REF="244">
relating to our affairs, which it was nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be made ac|quainted with. Mrs. Hindon's infor|mation is but too true, I perceive, added I; but on what we po&s;&s;e&s;s we mu&s;t con|trive to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and you need not be afraid to confe&s;s the wor&s;t, for this di&s;appoint|ment to my hopes has inured me to mor|tification.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, an&s;wered he, that I am afraid Mrs. Hindon has authority but too good for the abrupt di&s;covery &s;he has made of your affairs. As I flattered my&s;elf that pecuniary misfortunes would neither have been felt nor regarded while you enjoyed the affection and prorection of Lord Belmont, I wi&s;hed not to di&s;turb you with the apprehen&s;ion of an evil which might never arrive; but &s;orry I am to confe&s;s the claims of Mr. Ben&s;e|ley's creditors are become &s;o great, that it is much to be feared your fortune will be reduced to pretty near what Mrs. Hin|don
<PB N="240" REF="245">
mentioned&mdash;two thou&s;and pounds, or about that &s;um. There is no &s;aying however how things may turn out, as no|thing is yet &s;ettled; but I wi&s;h not to flatter you, while I ob&s;erve and admire that fortitude and &s;trength of mind that ri&s;es &s;uperior to di&s;appointments under which the bulk of mankind would &s;ink into de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>Well, my dear Sir, cried I, there is no help for this misfortune. Thank heaven a little yet remains. We mu&s;t immediately think of &s;ome private abode, where we may live peaceably and tran|quilly, no longer agitated with the wi&s;hes nor tormented by the expectations which have kept our minds ever &s;ince we left Languedoc in a &s;tate of tumult and &s;u&s;|pen&s;e. All expectation is at an end; for we have nothing now to hope, but that we may enjoy enough out of the wreck of our fortune to exi&s;t with decency and comfort in ob&s;curity. What is it but re|turning
<PB N="241" REF="246">
to a retirement that experience has convinced us we are capable of en|joying, and that habit and education have both con&s;pired to render even agreeable to us. We &s;hall &s;oon forget this bu&s;y aera of our lives, or regard it but as an unea&s;y, trouble&s;ome dream, which we &s;hall be delighted to find has vani&s;hed away.</P>
<P>Upon you, my dear Sir, continued I, who have &s;o faithfully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly fulfilled the fatigueing and di&s;agreeable charge impo&s;ed on you by my dear fa|ther, we mu&s;t &s;till lean for further direc|tion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Your goodne&s;s and zeal mu&s;t expect &s;till further trouble in &s;eeking out for us &s;ome humble re&s;idence. Our abode mu&s;t be as &s;imple as is con|&s;i&s;tent with neatne&s;s and decency, in &s;ome retired &s;pot in a cheap country.</P>
<P>And would you have the barbarity to exclude me from your dwelling, cried he, with a &s;udden eagerne&s;s which he &s;eemed
<PB N="242" REF="247">
incapable of repre&s;&s;ing, but which, as if con&s;cious of having gone too far, he in|&s;tantly checked, and added in a &s;oftened tone tho' with vi&s;ible emotion, will my dear and amiable wards allow me as their guardian, warmly intere&s;ted in their hap|pine&s;s, to propo&s;e a &s;cheme&mdash;a &s;cheme, repeated he he&s;itating, which I have been for &s;ome time revolving in my mind le&s;t things &s;hould take this unfavorable turn. It is indeed a plan which no other circum|&s;tances could have ju&s;tified&mdash;and even now requires&mdash;But I &s;hall lay hold of &s;ome other opportunity of pre&s;enting it to your con&s;ideration, when I have more clearly weighed it and con&s;idered it's con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>Oh tell it us now, my dear Sir, cried Fanny with impatience. What would become of us if we had not &s;o good, &s;o kind, and &s;o able a friend to advi&s;e us.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard, affected at the&s;e words, could hardly di&s;per&s;e a tear which ru&s;hed
<PB N="243" REF="248">
into his eye, and unable to an&s;wer, took advantage of Mi&s;s Par&s;ons entering to leave us ha&s;tily. The &s;oftne&s;s of that amiable girl's nature made Fanny's ap|parent grief infectious; and without ut|tering a &s;yllable, &s;he gave way to a &s;ud|den bur&s;t of tears; which tender &s;ympa|thy, had I not been before prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour, would alone have endeared her to me. I was obliged to become her comforter likewi&s;e; and a&s;&s;ured her we were weeping a di&s;appointment, not a calamity; and indulging in tears, which after the fir&s;t &s;hock it was weakne&s;s to allow to flow, and therefore merited not the kind compa&s;&s;ion they had excited.</P>
<P>I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to di&s;cover that &s;he was perfectly informed not only of the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s but with every circum&s;tance relating to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, which &s;he told us Mrs. Hindon, oppre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ecret, had been &s;o eager to divulge, that not only
<PB N="244" REF="249">
her&s;elf, but Lady Farnford and &s;everal of her friends below had been already partakers of it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon mu&s;t look upon her word as nothing, &s;aid I, for &s;he promi&s;ed &s;e|crecy.</P>
<P>Ah, Madam! if you knew all, cried &s;he, and &s;hook her head emphatically&mdash; and indeed I have more than once thought of mentioning it to you; but as I &s;aw little danger of your being led into diffi|culties, and beheld you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pru|dence &s;ufficient to &s;ecure you from dan|ger, I thought it needle&s;s to hazard my aunt's di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;hould my conduct ever have become &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>You mean with regard to Captain Wil|mot, cried Fanny, but thank God the di&s;covery you hint at has been already made, time enough to prevent any ill con&s;equences from his duplicity. Indeed had his fortune been &s;plendid to my wi&s;h, and his affection as &s;incere as I be|lieve
<PB N="245" REF="250">
it pretended, to pity alone, not at|tachment, would he have owed the &s;uc|ce&s;s which Mrs. Hindon's artful repre|&s;entations and my &s;imple inexperience might perhaps have led me to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>I am afraid indeed Madam, an&s;wered &s;he, that my cou&s;in merits not the honor of your good opinion. But as to that plan, though I have long &s;u&s;pected it I never once dreamt of interfering, as I concluded till this moment it had not only the approbation of your own heart, but likewi&s;e of Mi&s;s Seymour's judg|ment.</P>
<P>Far from it indeed, cried I. My opi|nion of Captain Wilmot has ever been &s;uch, that independent of the embarra&s;&s;|ment of his fortune, this &s;tep never &s;hould have received my concurrence while I knew my &s;i&s;ter's heart was not deeply in|tere&s;ted.</P>
<P>You amaze me Madam, for indeed Mrs. Hindon long &s;ince gave me to un|der&s;tand
<PB N="246" REF="251">
that it was a match where no material objections on either &s;ide could po&s;&s;ibly be oppo&s;ed to ob&s;truct its pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon then &s;poke from her wi&s;hes, not her conviction, for from the beginning I am convinced &s;he dreaded its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s Par&s;ons, I heartily congratulate you on having e&s;caped the &s;nare; for it is a &s;ecret to few that Captain Wilmot, from a de|&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ion for play, has mortgaged his e&s;tate, at no time con&s;iderable, to very near its full value, and if he has not already wholly ruined him&s;elf, his extra|vagance, un&s;ubdued by experience, &s;uffi|ciently proves that &s;uch a termination mu&s;t &s;oon take place. But on this head having received fal&s;e intelligence, I con|cluded you acted from the dictates of affection; an idea which was &s;ufficient to deter me from interfering by an ex|planation
<PB N="247" REF="252">
that might have been but indif|ferently received, and which at all events I could not have been ju&s;tified for bring|ing to light.</P>
<P>I thought, cried I, you had begun by indirectly propo&s;ing to reveal all. If &s;e|crecy was your determined re&s;olution how was this in your power?</P>
<P>I meant all that concerned you, Ma|dam, not what regarded your &s;i&s;ter. Of her affairs I was informed, and in divulg|ing my cou&s;in's real &s;ituation, from the charges of treachery, however innocent my intention and however beneficial the con&s;equences, I could not have been wholly exculpated, while confidence alone had put it in my power to betray.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Par&s;ons then ha&s;tened to inform us, that on the very evening which &s;uc|ceeded that of our arrival in England, Mr. Howard having on his vi&s;it to his brother and &s;i&s;ter di&s;clo&s;ed our &s;ituation, and acquainted them with our real name
<PB N="248" REF="253">
and &s;plendid connection under the tie of &s;ecrecy, and likewi&s;e with the amount of our fortune, Mrs. Hindon &s;eized the ear|lie&s;t opportunity of making a confidant of her friend Lady Farnford.</P>
<P>The two ladies were &s;eated in Mrs. Hindon's dre&s;&s;ing-room, which is mere|ly divided by a thin partition from the apartment we at pre&s;ent occupy, and which was then inhabited by Mi&s;s Par|&s;ons. She happened to be quietly placed at her book, when her &s;tudies were in|terrupted by the conver&s;ation of the next room, and her attention &s;o unavoidably attracted by the eager vociferation of this confidential tete a tete, that contrary ei|ther to her inclination or de&s;ign, &s;he found her&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their &s;e|crets.</P>
<P>The two friends, after pondering, won|dering, and go&s;&s;iping, began to reflect that with ten thou&s;and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and at lea&s;t double that &s;um in expectation,
<PB N="249" REF="254">
with the advantages of a &s;plendid family connection, Fanny and I pre&s;ented no in|con&s;iderable gratification to the avarice or vanity of any needy pretenders.</P>
<P>From the&s;e particulars they &s;oon be|gan to form wi&s;hes that prizes &s;o con&s;i|derable could be &s;ecured to their own families, by means of whatever males of their hou&s;e &s;hould be matrimonially di&s;|po&s;ed: and Captain Wilmot, the nephew of the one, and Farnford, the &s;on of the other, in&s;tantly occurred to the active and fertile imaginations of the&s;e bu&s;y in|termedling old women. Tho&s;e two gen|tlemen, in whom the ladies felt a mutual intere&s;t, were at once indigent and extra|vagant, good looking and &s;howy, cir|cum&s;tances which rendered the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;chemes both e&s;&s;ential and probable. They re&s;olved however carefully to con|ceal their plan till ripe for execution; doubting not but occa&s;ional meetings and frequent intercour&s;e would gradually fa|cilitate
<PB N="250" REF="255">
its progre&s;s and in&s;ure it a fortu|nate conclu&s;ion. It was in con&s;equence of this that you two ladies were entreated with a di&s;play &s;o oftentatious of ho&s;pita|ble civility to take up your abode in Mrs. Hindon's family.</P>
<P>Fanny and I both warmly thanked Mi&s;s Par&s;ons for this information, dicta|ted by the keenne&s;s of her feelings and by that gratitude which a little kindne&s;s and a few trivial attentions had excited: attentions that no delicate mind could have withheld te&s;tifying even for a per&s;on le&s;s amiable, in a &s;ituation &s;o humiliating as hers.</P>
<P>Good heavens! cried I, and was I too the object of a project? We have un|doubtedly made a &s;ufficient return to Mrs. Hindon for all her civilities in fur|ni&s;hing &s;uch amu&s;ing and intere&s;ting &s;ub|jects for her active &s;pirit to work on. I think, however, as our fortune was the &s;ecret &s;pring of all the&s;e intrigues, we

have little rea&s;on now to apprehend either art or contrivances. The primary mo|tive for all the&s;e &s;peculations has va|ni&s;hed, and I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect the un|conquerable and violent pa&s;&s;ion which has occa&s;ioned &s;uch ravages in the bo|&s;oms of the two gentlemen, being de|prived of this nouri&s;hment, will quietly &s;ink into neglect and indifference; the only advantage it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that re&s;ults from this change in our pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>This intelligence at another time might have occa&s;ioned me unea&s;ine&s;s; but at the moment it was communicated the information was attended by a number of others &s;o much more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, that I hardly gave it any attention. It only encrea&s;ed the di&s;like which re&s;entment at Mrs. Hindon's behaviour with regard to Fanny had before excited, and which, as this clue to her conduct deprived her even of the merit her ho&s;pitality and ci|vilities
<PB N="252" REF="257">
had before claimed, now almo&s;t amounted to repugnance and contempt.</P>
<P>The motive of her advice, indelicate and unfeeling, to apply to Lady Linro&s;e, not merely for her mediation but even for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is now fully explained, as al&s;o the &s;ecret cau&s;e of that frigid chagrin too potent either for concealment or re|pre&s;&s;ion, which diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over both her manner and countenance on receiv|ing the news of our cruel di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Perhaps I am a little &s;evere in my ex|pre&s;&s;ions: for after all, her di&s;appoint|ment, poor woman, might prove little inferior to ours. Her de&s;igns and ex|pectations are compleatly fru&s;trated by the &s;ame unlucky event that puts ours to flight; and perhaps in &s;ome minds the de&s;ires &s;ugge&s;ted by pride are as power|ful as tho&s;e which rea&s;on, nature, and feeling excite. To lo&s;e the hopes of an alliance that flatters her vanity, may to Mrs. Hindon prove a blow as &s;evere as

<P>MRS. Hindon's company not having left her till late, I had &s;ome hours lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue my journal. We then went down to &s;upper, which proved a dull and comfortle&s;s repa&s;t. Mrs. Hindon was cold and out of humour; her hu&s;|band &s;leepy and fatigued, Fanny dejected, Mr. Howard thoughtful, and for my&s;elf I was grave and &s;ilent. Mi&s;s Jenny was indeed the only per&s;on in company who
<PB N="254" REF="259">
retained her u&s;ual behaviour; at all times &s;oft, humble, and melancholy.</P>
<P>The change our &s;ituation had under|gone in the eyes of Mrs. Hindon &s;ince the morning, &s;hone con&s;picuous in her manner, and produced an alteration hard|ly to be credited. That flattering civi|lity, bordering often almo&s;t upon &s;ervility, tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of unalterable e&s;teem, friend&s;hip, and regard, that u&s;ed &s;ome times, from our utter inability to make adequate returns, ab&s;olutely to over|power us, were this evening converted into frigid re&s;erve, mixed with a di&s;plea|&s;ure which &s;eemed to avow that &s;he could hardly forgive her&s;elf for having hitherto lavi&s;hed upon us &s;o much unnece&s;&s;ary re|&s;pect and attention, and for which morti|fication &s;he meant to indemnify her&s;elf in the &s;ea&s;on of our humiliation, by making all proper repri&s;als. Poor woman! &s;he is infinitely mi&s;taken if &s;he imagines I am in the lea&s;t humbled by this rever&s;e. It
<PB N="255" REF="260">
is not, thank heaven, in the power of for|tune to produce an effect &s;o degrading on my mind. I looked down on her with a degree of pity which &s;oftened my contempt, on witne&s;&s;ing the littlene&s;s of mind her conduct betrayed.</P>
<P>We were not long in &s;eparating for the night: and as I have too much anx|iety on my &s;pirits to hope for re&s;t, here am I retired to pa&s;s an hour in chat with my deare&s;t Sophia, while poor Fanny is forgetting the bu&s;y occurrences of this di&s;agreeable day in the &s;oothing arms of &s;leep.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the difficulties and mortifi|cations we have encountered, and which at our time of life, when the feelings are all tremblingly alive and the pa&s;&s;ions ea|ger and un&s;ubdued, are endured with double angui&s;h, how alleviating, how grateful to my heart is the conviction of my beloved Sophia's never failing &s;ym|pathy and affection. There yet remains
<PB N="256" REF="261">
to us heaven's fir&s;t and choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ing&mdash; a dear and tender friend, who feels for our embarra&s;&s;ments and enters into all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es with the kinde&s;t intere&s;t and warme&s;t commi&s;eration. Oh! my So|phia! ought I then to complain?</P>
<P>Yet, yet, my dear, I indeed require your friendly &s;ympathy; for at this in|&s;tant, without labouring, thank God, un|der any heavy affliction, (for in my opi|nion to the &s;tings of guilt, or to the heart rending de&s;pair of lo&s;ing a friend tried and beloved, alone belongs that ex|pre&s;&s;ion), our &s;ituation is as comfortle&s;s, as di&s;agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. How are we to di&s;po&s;e of our&s;elves? Mrs. Hindon's Hou&s;e is no longer a re&s;idence for us. You will ea&s;ily perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of our quitting it in all ha&s;te; and I make no doubt may likewi&s;e conjecture, that after the vexatious adventure into which our re&s;idence in lodgings &s;o lately in|volved us, I mu&s;t feel no &s;mall degree
<PB N="257" REF="262">
of reluctance at the idea of venturing into others, without the protection of Mr. Howard, who&s;e attendance mu&s;t now of cour&s;e cea&s;e, when the title, though merely nominal, of our guardian is at an end; neither can I think without repug|nance of remaining in town, cooped up in &s;mall, confined, unwhole&s;ome apart|ments, and of &s;uch only will our finances allow; while a neat ru&s;tic habitation in the country can be procured perhaps at le&s;s expence.</P>
<P>Another motive no le&s;s powerful, con|&s;pires to give additional force to my de|&s;ire of leaving London as &s;oon as conve|nience will permit, and &s;ettling as far from it as po&s;&s;ible; I will confe&s;s my vanity, for &s;urely it is a natural pride&mdash; I cannot think of being recognized by Mr. Roat&s;ley, after this change in our appearance, without pain. Were he like Mrs. Hindon, to di&s;cover by his beha|viour that from our apparent fall we were

&s;unk in his e&s;timation, I &s;hould with ea&s;e ca&s;t him from my heart for ever: but of this mean weakne&s;s, incident only to common minds, I cannot &s;u&s;pect him. I fear only to be the object of his pity! Oh! Sophia! pity from Roat&s;ley would mortify me more &s;everely than unmerited contempt from the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>How few are there who do not allow them&s;elves, perhaps uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, to be more influenced by appearances than they &s;u&s;pect. Mi&s;s Seymour, while moving in a &s;phere, if not &s;plendid at lea&s;t cre|ditable, is no longer the &s;ame per&s;on when reduced to exi&s;t only through the efforts of her own indu&s;try; and though &s;till entitled to the re&s;pect of the unpre|judiced, nay perhaps to their e&s;teem, yet being &s;unk, to her intrin&s;ic value, and de|prived of a thou&s;and little adventitious circum&s;tances that give life and alacrity to an infant pa&s;&s;ion, how can it be &s;up|po&s;ed to combat and &s;truggle again&s;t
<PB N="259" REF="264">
tho&s;e dangerous mortifications which are the greate&s;t foes to its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>No, Sophia, I &s;incerely hope I &s;hall &s;ee him no more. To you, I divulge every thought that oppre&s;&s;es my heart, for from your &s;ympathy alone I can hope to derive the &s;lighte&s;t alleviation. To you then, my dear, I will acknowledge, that the &s;evere&s;t wound my grandfather's renunciation has inflicted, is its having awakened me from a plea&s;ing delu&s;ive dream, on the idea of which I have al|mo&s;t exi&s;ted ever &s;ince I overheard Roat&s;|ley's acknowledgment to his friend of his partiality in my favour. I confe&s;s it was weak, it was unpardonable, to allow my mind to indulge in &s;uch reveries; yet they &s;tole on me imperceptibly, and I could not re&s;i&s;t giving way to the flat|tering hopes, that had he beheld me in that advantageous point of view in which rank and fortune ever place their vota|ries, had he &s;een me in the circle to

which my birth entitles me&mdash;in &s;hort, my dear, as we live not in the age of ro|mance, where the &s;plendors of life are wholly di&s;regarded, it is probable his ri&s;ing attachment would not have been greatly damped by the knowledge of my being Lord Belmont's grandchild, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable fortune. Had this been the <HI>&s;ole</HI> motive, or even the <HI>chief</HI> one, little &s;hould I have prized the flame: but remember he loved me when the&s;e particulars were unknown, and la|boured for my welfare when a veil of doubtful ob&s;curity was thrown over my &s;ituation. The&s;e are circum&s;tances to give weight and value to his pa&s;&s;ion. But the&s;e chimeras are now no more. I mu&s;t drive them from my thoughts for ever; and in&s;tead of confe&s;&s;ing and indulging, check and conquer them with all the for|titude I can &s;ummon to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>Going down this morning to break|fa&s;t, I was &s;urpri&s;ed when I entered to find Lady Farnford and Mrs. Hindon tete a tete, and &s;eemingly in earne&s;t conver&s;a|tion. Good morning, Mi&s;s Seymour, cried the latter with a &s;miling air, the traces of la&s;t night's hauteur being en|tirely vani&s;hed from her brow. Lady Farnford likewi&s;e acco&s;ted me with abun|dance of civility and kindne&s;s, and they in&s;i&s;ted on placing me between them.</P>
<P>Come, cried Mrs. Hindon, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, which &s;he appeared to have em|ployed in con&s;idering how &s;he &s;hould in|troduce without abruptne&s;s what &s;he in|tended to &s;ay&mdash;Why &s;hould there be &s;uch di&s;tance among friends? To tell the plain truth Mi&s;s Seymour, I could not &s;hut my eyes all night for thinking in what a de&s;titute and di&s;mal way you and Mi&s;s Fanny mu&s;t live if you are not ruled and per&s;uaded by tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted
<PB N="262" REF="267">
in you. Here is Lady Farnford, who de|clares her&s;elf as anxious for your welfare as if you were her own children, and who prote&s;ts that if you were &s;o in fact &s;he &s;hould be the fir&s;t to advi&s;e an immediate application to my Lord Belmont. His Lord&s;hip cannot &s;ee his grandchildren &s;tarve, or what is &s;carcely preferable, ju&s;tle through life neglected and forgot|ten, for want of that little which his af|fluent fortune can &s;pare with ea&s;e. Con|&s;ider he is unacquainted with your mis|fortune. He concludes you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of twenty thou&s;and pounds; and tho' that is but a trifle to what you might rea&s;on|ably expect, yet no doubt he might ima|gine it enough to &s;upport you genteelly. I a&s;&s;ure you in your ca&s;e, with &s;uch ju&s;t claims, I would not content my&s;elf even with a little; and if he finds you mean to make a piece of work about it, take my word for it he will alter his tone as they &s;ay. Mr. Howard told us t'other day,
<PB N="263" REF="268">
talking of your father, that if he had cho&s;en to refu&s;e the compromi&s;e offered him by my Lord, he might have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of Lord Belmont's e&s;tates of three thou&s;and per annum; and tho' he gave away his own money, he had undoubtedly no right to mar the in|heritance of his children. That alone would &s;urely make a good law &s;uit; and the &s;imple apprehen&s;ion of it would cer|tainly be &s;ufficient to frighten my Lord into terms. Come, Mi&s;s Seymour, I'm &s;ure a young lady of your &s;en&s;e mu&s;t &s;ee clearly that rather than have &s;uch di&s;tur|bance and noi&s;e created, your grandfather would ea&s;ily be induced to &s;ettle hand|&s;omely on you, were it only for hu&s;h money.</P>
<P>Allow me to a&s;&s;ure you once for all, Madam, an&s;wered I, that nothing on earth &s;hall ever prevail with me to at|tempt &s;uch a mea&s;ure. I am confident you mu&s;t have wholly mi&s;under&s;tood Mr.
<PB N="264" REF="269">
Howard on this point; for &s;uch are the unhappy circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, that my father pre&s;erved no &s;ort of claim upon Lord Belmont's fortune, and was tho|roughly &s;atisfied and contented with the &s;tipulation. Tho' this &s;um is now great|ly reduced, we have rea&s;on to hope a lit|tle &s;till remains, and on that little I tru&s;t we &s;hall be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t independant of the&s;e cruel relations, who have &s;o unna|turally renounced us. To have recour&s;e to law, (were there even a probability of &s;ucce&s;s,) is a plan at which delicacy and pride equally revolt.</P>
<P>Pride and non&s;en&s;e, cried &s;he. Indeed Mi&s;s Seymour I cannot conceive for my part the meaning of all this delicacy and refinement. 'Tis pa&s;t my comprehen&s;ion I confe&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps, cried Lady Farnford, who had not as yet been able to &s;peak for the volubility of her friend&mdash;perhaps Mi&s;s Seymour is deterred by the hopele&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="265" REF="270">
&s;ucce&s;s. All the world e&s;teems Lord Belmont irrevocable in his determina|tions. He is indeed a very ob&s;tinate, whim&s;ical old man. Lady Linro&s;e too is generally di&s;liked; being haughty, proud, and inflexible.</P>
<P>Yes, and no doubt her Lady&s;hip finds her own advantage, cried Mrs. Hindon, in keeping her nieces at a di&s;tance from their grandfather.</P>
<P>We have no rea&s;on to accu&s;e her La|dy&s;hip of any &s;uch intention, &s;aid I. Per|haps, had &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either &s;en&s;ibility or benevolence equal to our wi&s;hes, we might have expected a little more kindne&s;s (tho' ever &s;o privately offered,) to two un|friended relations; who, divided from their friends, and in a manner alone in the univer&s;e, lay claim, from her at lea&s;t, to the good offices of humanity: but tho' &s;he has not proved warmly our friend and protectre&s;s, I am thoroughly convinced &s;he is far from having injured the cau&s;e
<PB N="266" REF="271">
intru&s;ted to her care. She is not gene|rally beloved; but is allowed to be a woman of principle and honour; and a trifling portion of the&s;e qualities mu&s;t prove &s;ufficient to deter her from a con|duct &s;o unworthy.</P>
<P>Well, Mi&s;s Seymour, re&s;umed Lady Farnford, Lady Linro&s;e is not a woman ea&s;ily melted by &s;entiments of pity. But pride may extort where charity fails; and the de&s;ire of preventing a revival of&mdash;of the unlucky &s;tory, may perhaps prevail with her to intercede with my Lord Bel|mont to allow you a pretty round &s;um to be quiet.</P>
<P>To Lady Linro&s;e, cried I with firm|ne&s;s, never will I apply.</P>
<P>Why then, returned Lady Farnford, what I mean to propo&s;e is, applying to their &s;on. The idea occurred to me la&s;t night, on hearing Mr. Roat&s;ley talked of in the highe&s;t terms by &s;ome friends we had to &s;up with us.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="272">Mr. Roat&s;ley! exclaimed I.</P>
<P>Yes, Mr. Roat&s;ley. It &s;eems his elec|tion to the borough of&mdash;took place the day before ye&s;terday. Some of the company had been warmly his friends on that occa&s;ion, which naturally led them to talk of him, and they &s;poke in &s;uch high terms of his character, that I could not avoid at the time concluding what probability of &s;ucce&s;s an application of this kind mu&s;t have to a young man of his di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>What connection has Mr. Roat&s;ley with Lady Linro&s;e? cried I in a tremor.</P>
<P>Lord don't you know, Mi&s;s Seymour, that he is their &s;on, and of cour&s;e your fir&s;t cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Their &s;on! Good heavens! exclaimed I, quite out of breath.</P>
<P>Good &s;tars, &s;aid Mrs. Hindon, is not that the young man who accompanied you in your pa&s;&s;age from Calais, and of whom my brother talks &s;o highly?</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="273">I know not, Madam.&mdash;But I hope not.</P>
<P>And pray why do you hope &s;o? For my part I think it is the mo&s;t agreeable intelligence at this juncture you could wi&s;h to hear: for I a&s;&s;ure you my brother Howard told me that he &s;eemed much &s;truck, and indeed no wonder, by the elegance of your appearance; and be|&s;ides, was it not he who attended you &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly at the Opera hou&s;e. Oh! I make no doubt he knew perfectly well how nearly you were connected, though perhaps a prohibition from her Lady&s;hip deterred him from acknowledging the re|lation&s;hip. And &s;o you never once &s;u&s;|pected that he was the late Lord Linro&s;e's &s;on all the while? well that is the drolle&s;t affair I have heard this age.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay Madam, cried I, there may be &s;ome mi&s;take in this, el&s;e we &s;hould have been &s;ooner informed. How comes the &s;on of Lady Linro&s;e to appear under a borrowed name?</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="274">O as to that point, &s;aid Lady Farnford, in this country nothing is more common. Mr. Roat&s;ley a&s;&s;umed his pre&s;ent name becau&s;e it was accompanied by the inhe|ritance of an e&s;tate in Ireland, left him by an uncle of his mother's, who died a few months ago.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I convey to you, Sophia, an idea of the variety of emotions that agi|tated my heart at this moment. Oh! it is wholly impo&s;&s;ible! This intelligence, &s;o unexpected, &s;o extraordinary, and oh! &s;hall I add, &s;o mortifying, (for a mixture of humiliation rendered my feelings at this moment &s;till more intolerable, ac|tually drew tears from my eyes:&mdash;tears, the &s;ource of which I could not ab&s;o|lutely define, but which, to my compa|nions, appeared merely the natural effects of uncertainty and vexation.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia! how long have we re|mained in ignorance with regard to a point &s;o infinitely intere&s;ting. But I now
<PB N="270" REF="275">
find that this inheritance, and con&s;e|quently this change of name, took place immediately before our arrival in Eng|land. Indeed, on inve&s;tigating the mat|ter, Mr. Howard has di&s;covered that Mr. Roat&s;ley's return was occa&s;ioned by that event. Mr. Howard therefore, in his enquiries relative to our family, heard often of a Mr. Dudley, but was informed he was abroad with his brother and Lord Belmont, and never received the &s;lighte&s;t hint to lead him to conclude that our agreeable fellow traveller, Mr. Roat&s;ley, was in fact the &s;econd &s;on of the late Lord Linro&s;e, who&s;e character, even from the lips of Mrs. Weldon, does &s;o much honour to his family. Indeed, had the&s;e enquiries been made of late, no doubt we mu&s;t have been immediately acquain|ted with the truth; but the &s;ociety in which he ranges is totally di&s;tinct from that in which chance has placed us, and you may recollect it was directly on our
<PB N="271" REF="276">
arrival that Mr. Howard exerted him&s;elf to &s;atisfy our anxious de&s;ire of being in|formed of every circum&s;tance concerning our relations. At that time Mr, Roat&s;|ley was him&s;elf but ju&s;t arrived at his mother's country &s;eat. His return was not generally known; and as we have not been once in any private company with him, excepting one half hour in our own lodgings, no opportunity for a di&s;|covery could po&s;&s;ibly have occurred. Not but that a &s;ecret &s;olicitude has in|duced me more than once to a&s;k &s;everal ladies who have been at different times vi&s;itors here if they were acquainted with Roat&s;ley; but a negative reply was al|ways given, and I make no doubt he is wholly unknown to mo&s;t of Mrs. Hin|don's friends.</P>
<P>I will not, however, comment on this intere&s;ting di&s;covery till I have concluded my fatiguing conver&s;ation with the&s;e of|ficious advi&s;ers.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="277">You mu&s;t know, re&s;umed Lady Farn|ford, that this young man has one of the be&s;t characters in the kingdom. To him therefore, Mi&s;s Seymour, I would advi&s;e you to apply by letter without lo&s;s of time, or perhaps Mr. Howard might tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s better in per&s;on. Mr. Roat&s;ley is adored by his family; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, I am told, an influence over the mind of Lord Belmont which would in|&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. If the old Lord thinks his vow binding, why he may keep it if he plea&s;es, only let him act with ju&s;tice, and &s;upport you in the line of life to which you were born.</P>
<P>Good God, my dear Sophia, what a propo&s;al? It entirely dive&s;ted me of the patience and temper with which I had hitherto li&s;tened to advice &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, &s;o indelicate, &s;o perfectly unfeeling. I there|fore put a final period to a per&s;ecution that was grown intolerable, by expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="273" REF="278">
my&s;elf with a cold and determined dig|nity, bordering perhaps a little on hauteur.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave, &s;aid I when I could contrive to be heard, entirely to act for my&s;elf and from my own &s;entiments, in a point in which my&s;elf and &s;i&s;ter only are concerned; and tho' we mu&s;t con|&s;ider our&s;elves as under obligations to tho&s;e friends who wi&s;h to alter a re&s;olu|tion they may deem ab&s;urd and prejudi|cial to our intere&s;t, yet I mu&s;t u&s;e the freedom to acknowledge that we partake &s;o much of our grandfather's firmne&s;s as to be quite immoveable in our determi|nations, when convinced there is nothing in them contrary to rea&s;on and rectitude.</P>
<P>The gravity with which I pronounced this, di&s;concerted them; and they both in a breath began to apologize for the liberty they had taken in an affair in which they &s;aid <HI>our intere&s;t alone</HI> could be &s;uppo&s;ed to influence them. I could not re&s;i&s;t &s;miling at the expre&s;&s;ion. I have
<PB N="274" REF="279">
&s;ome rea&s;on to apprehend, however, that I &s;hould not &s;o &s;oon have got rid of im|portunities equally trouble&s;ome and of|ficious, had not the re&s;t of the family made their appearance to breakfa&s;t, which happily interrupted the eager volubility of the ladies.</P>
<P>Oh, my Sophia, what a di&s;covery! It has engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed me ever &s;ince I was made acquainted with it. Is it in|deed po&s;&s;ible that the ties of blood as well as tho&s;e of affection have united me with this amiable young man. I blu&s;h to make this confe&s;&s;ion in terms &s;o &s;trong, &s;o explanatory; but the agitation of the pre&s;ent moment gives defiance to diffi|dence and &s;hame, and conquers the reluc|tance with which &s;uch an avowal mu&s;t ever be accompanied.</P>
<P>I have pondered and con&s;idered every circum&s;tance of Mr. Roat&s;ley's conduct &s;ince the beginning of our acquaintance, and indeed there are a number of circum|&s;tances
<PB N="275" REF="280">
explained by this information, which hurt and di&s;plea&s;e me.</P>
<P>After thinking and reflecting on the whole tenour of his behaviour, I am con|vinced that duty and obedience to his fa|mily have enrolled him a party in their determinations. How flattering, how humane were his attentions during our pa&s;&s;age, while ignorant of our &s;ecret claims to his good offices: yet how ea&s;ily was he impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t injurious &s;u&s;|picions to our di&s;advantage immediately afterwards: &s;u&s;picions, to which he mu&s;t have &s;ubmitted with hardly an attempt towards being undeceived; for what con|fidence was to be repo&s;ed in the repre|&s;entations of a woman to who&s;e character and principles, even by the confe&s;&s;ion of his friend Captain Brad&s;haw, neither tru&s;t nor credit were to be given. Oh! So|phia! I am afraid he would have re|mained at ea&s;e under this fal&s;e opinion, had not Mr. Howard's letter to Lady
<PB N="276" REF="281">
Linro&s;e di&s;covered us to him as a connec|tion, in who&s;e infamy and di&s;grace a &s;light degree of delicacy mu&s;t have ren|dered him concerned. It was the know|ledge of this circum&s;tance, I now plainly perceive, that induced him to make known to Mr. Howard his fears for my &s;afety, and which prevailed on him to di&s;cover an anxiety that wore the engag|ing a&s;pect of di&s;intere&s;ted humanity, whil&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to have actuated the bo|&s;om of a &s;tranger, but which in Mr. Roat&s;ley was but giving way to natural feelings.</P>
<P>I expre&s;s my&s;elf perhaps with acrimo|ny; indeed on reading over what I have written I am confounded at my warmth of expre&s;&s;ion. It is not ea&s;y, however, wholly to dive&s;t ones &s;elf of prejudice in a point dear and intere&s;ting to the heart. I am &s;everely wounded and di&s;appointed at one part of his conduct, which leads me perhaps to view it in other particu|lars
<PB N="277" REF="282">
through a fal&s;e and unju&s;t medium. His behaviour after all, in regard to me, has been amiable, nay noble in the highe&s;t degree: but ah! did he po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind, the &s;oul, the feelings which I have been blind enough to attribute to him, never could he have &s;tooped to countenance a tran&s;action &s;o cruel and unnatural as that of renouncing us. He would not have pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf upon us for a &s;tranger, con|cealed the relation&s;hip of which he was a&s;hamed, and courted our acquaintance under a borrowed form while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a title &s;o indi&s;putable to our notice, had he cho&s;en to have claimed it.</P>
<P>Perhaps indeed his mother had laid her injunctions on him to remain neuter in this affair till Lord Belmont's intentions were made known. But am I blinded by prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion when I a&s;&s;ert that to de&s;ert us after our accidental rencontre, and that profu&s;ion of profe&s;&s;ions of which it was productive, to withdraw his attention and
<PB N="278" REF="283">
regard only when from the renunciation of his family and from the peculiarity of our circum&s;tances he knew it was become e&s;&s;ential to us, is a &s;tep which even pa|rental duty can by no means ju&s;tify. Common minds may argue in that man|ner, may in that manner act from mo|tives of cold obedience, but if his heart is compo&s;ed of materials &s;o frigid, &s;o cor|rect, it is a lo&s;s little to be regretted. I am offended Sophia, and perhaps unju&s;t|ly; but I had weakly flattered my&s;elf our &s;entiments were in &s;ome mea&s;ure con|genial; and his conduct has proved &s;o oppo&s;ite from what I am certain mine in &s;imilar circum&s;tances would have been, that I am &s;everely wounded.</P>
<P>But my warmth may perhaps have led my conclu&s;ions too far. Lord Belmont's re&s;olution relative to us, mu&s;t have ar|rived during his grand&s;on's ab&s;ence at his election, in which ca&s;e he can hardly as yet have been informed of it, nor con&s;e|quently
<PB N="279" REF="284">
have determined how he will in future conduct him&s;elf. His return to town, which will probably happen in the cour&s;e of a few days, mu&s;t therefore ex|plain whether or not I have done him inju&s;tice. If he yet &s;hews him&s;elf in the light of our relation, and di&s;avows his part of the family compact, I &s;hall confe&s;s him wholly entitled to the too favourable opinion I have hitherto entertained of him.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h things may not be &s;till wor&s;e with regard to Mr. Ben&s;eley's affairs than Mr. Howard has acknowledged; for that worthy friend is extremely thought|ful; and altho' I wi&s;hed exceedingly to have a little private conver&s;ation with him in order to con&s;ult about our future plans, I could find no opportunity, for he left the parlour immediately after he had done breakfa&s;t, and has been abroad all the morning. No time however is to be lo&s;t in deciding. I am now doubly
<PB N="280" REF="285">
anxious that our country &s;cheme may take place; and am labouring to become ea|ger for it; endeavouring to repre&s;ent it to my&s;elf in the gaie&s;t colours, as the ru|ral abode of peace, innocence, and har|mony, where no agitations &s;hall in future ruffle, nor painful mortifications di&s;turb the calm &s;erenity of our lives. But it is in vain. My bu&s;y imagination perpetu|ally places it in a different point of view, as a &s;tate of peacefulne&s;s, where tho' no|thing wounds us nothing &s;hall intere&s;t; and as a retirement, where tho' we enjoy tranquillity we &s;hall not be able to ta&s;te happine&s;s; and tho' tranquillity is per|haps in this fluctuating &s;tate the &s;ole point attainable, and that to which, all our wi&s;hes ought to be directed, yet at our time of life it is not ea&s;y to re&s;i&s;t the flat|tering hope that days of real enjoyment are yet in &s;tore for us. If this is a delu|&s;ion, yet oh may I ever cheri&s;h it as a &s;upport in every di&s;tre&s;s and a prop un|der

every difficulty; without which &s;ooth|ing con&s;olation life would be a burthen and &s;orrow un&s;upportable.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that Fanny has not &s;een Wilmot &s;ince the di&s;covery of the letter. His ab&s;ence, which is unu&s;ual, mu&s;t either be attributed to the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of his &s;chemes having been detected by his mi&s;take, or to the change in our affairs, which took place immediately after that event. No doubt his aunt has warned him to keep out of the way till our future expectations are clearly a&s;cer|tained. Fanny, who&s;e latent &s;pirit has been rou&s;ed by his duplicity, took the earlie&s;t opportunity to inform Mrs. Hin|don of her unalterable re&s;olution to break off all connection with her nephew. The lady received this determination with &s;ome appearance of &s;urpri&s;e, but with much le&s;s oppo&s;ition than would have fol|lowed &s;uch a &s;tep &s;ome days ago.</P>

<P>Mr. Howard did not appear ye&s;terday till dinner was announced, I had it there|fore in my power only to hint to him that I reque&s;ted he would not attempt from friendly compa&s;&s;ion to conceal any addi|tional di&s;appointments that were yet to be told us. He a&s;&s;ured me that nothing deci&s;ive had taken place; Mr. Ben&s;eley's affairs continuing in the confu&s;ion and uncertainty in which, he had before re|pre&s;ented them. This pa&s;&s;ed in a large company who dined here and &s;taid the evening; by which means it was not po&s;|&s;ible for me to reque&s;t a private confe|rence with him. Mr. Howard &s;eems, with his u&s;ual goodne&s;s, to participate in our chagrin; for I never ob&s;erved him before &s;o grave and thoughtful as he has been &s;ince the arrival of Lord Belmont's
<PB N="283" REF="288">
letter. I began to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome pri|vate unea&s;ine&s;s might have affected his &s;pirits; but a peculiar &s;oftne&s;s in his ad|dre&s;s, both to Fanny and my&s;elf, now convinces me that to his heart the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of his friends and tho&s;e more par|ticularly his own, convey almo&s;t equal pain.</P>
<P>I have had a long conver&s;ation this morning with Mi&s;s Par&s;ons. My heart, &s;oftened by my own di&s;appointments, &s;ympathizes in her's with augmented commi&s;eration; and as &s;he perceives that I, who was &s;o lately the happy object of her envy and admiration, as created for the enjoyment of affluence, pro&s;perity, and &s;ocial happine&s;s, am now her com|panion in &s;uffering, &s;he returns my at|tentions by redoubling her endeavours to &s;oothe and amu&s;e me, while &s;he finds, that tho' born to &s;o many advantages, I am no le&s;s open than her&s;elf to the attacks of fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="289">You imagine. Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;aid &s;he this morning as we &s;at together at work in my dre&s;&s;ing room, (for Mrs. Hindon was gone out and I had in&s;i&s;ted on Fan|ny's accompanying her in hopes that a little variety might di&s;&s;ipate the chagrin of her &s;pirits,) you imagine, and with rea&s;on that your mortifications and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es have been &s;evere: yet what have your &s;ufferings proved when compared with mine: hardly had I clo&s;ed the eyes of one beloved parent, when the other claimed the &s;ame &s;ad duty. The&s;e are however misfortunes which by the cour&s;e of nature we mu&s;t all expect. Heart|rending and acute as is the wound that &s;uch calamities inflict. Time's lenient hand generally be&s;tows the balm to clo&s;e it. That lo&s;s, heavy and irretrievable, did not come alone: the &s;everities of de|pendance, in&s;ignificance, and contempt, were the mi&s;erable con&s;equences of a blow in it&s;elf &s;carce &s;upportable. Nor
<PB N="285" REF="290">
was this all. She &s;topped, and hiding her face with her hands, &s;uddenly gave way to a violent bur&s;t of tears, which &s;eemed to have been irrepre&s;&s;ible and wholly overcame her.</P>
<P>I know well, cried I, you have &s;uffered the rigours of fate, and Heaven knows what yet may remain for our portion, &s;hould it plea&s;e Almighty Providence to deprive us of independence, by taking away the remnant of our &s;canty fortune. All we &s;hall have for it, my amiable friend, is to endeavour to profit from your laud|able example, and to &s;uffer unrepiningly tho&s;e ills, which from tru&s;t in the unerring ju&s;tice of Heaven, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured mu&s;t in the end work for our good.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam! cried &s;he, but there is one blow, cruel, biting, and acute, which the Almighty has not inflicted on you, and indeed it appears impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould ever experience. You may behold your&s;elf abandoned by the world, regarded
<PB N="286" REF="291">
with di&s;dain, and treated with indelicacy; but this you may bear, and from the con&s;cious &s;uperiority of your mind, may bear perhaps with indifference; but ah! Mi&s;s Seymour, there are wounds yet more bitter, feelings yet more keen, which I have endured, and which I heartily pray you may never know.</P>
<P>Heaven only knows, thought I to my|&s;elf, whether the&s;e bitter, keen, and heart|felt &s;ufferings, may not yet prove mine.</P>
<P>Yes cried I, to the amiable, unhappy girl, taking hold of her hand with unfeig|ned compa&s;sion, I am &s;en&s;ible you claim too ju&s;tly the &s;uperiority in affliction. My heart feels &s;incerely for what yours has endured. You have my warme&s;t &s;ympa|thy; and if the demand is not importu|nate, and the recital will not prove a probe rather than a relief, will you gra|tify me &s;o far as to unburthen your mind to me.</P>
<P>It is long, long, cried &s;he, &s;oftened
<PB N="287" REF="292">
at my reque&s;t, &s;ince my heart has experi|enced the &s;olace of confidence. The world turns wich di&s;gu&s;t from the oppre&s;&s;|ed; it flies di&s;tre&s;s as if contagious; and pro&s;perity beholds it as a frightfull pic|ture pre&s;ented to its view to check di&s;&s;i|pation and to frown on enjoyment.</P>
<P>She then told me that when &s;he was yet at &s;chool, Captain Wilmot, at that time a young En&s;ign, and nearly related to her, u&s;ed frequently to &s;pend &s;ome weeks at her father's vicarage for the amu&s;ement of &s;hooting; and that during the holidays, when &s;he always returned home, he con&s;tantly paid her the mo&s;t flattering attention, till &s;he confe&s;&s;ed he made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on her heart. Be|ing however hardly fifteen, and little of her age, &s;he looked upon her&s;elf as a mere girl, and the &s;chool duties gene|rally drove her cou&s;in from her thoughts and conquered her attachment.</P>
<P>At &s;eventeen &s;he quitted &s;chool entirely.
<PB N="288" REF="293">
It was then that the abovementioned di|ver&s;ion furni&s;hed a pretence for the Cap|tain's &s;pending almo&s;t the whole &s;hooting &s;ea&s;on at their hou&s;e; a circum&s;tance that the young lady &s;u&s;pected proceeded from a tenderer motive. In fact he had been but a &s;hort time there, when he took an opportunity to di&s;clo&s;e his pa&s;&s;ion, which met with all the &s;ucce&s;s he could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Gained by his early and continued par|tiality, accu&s;tomed as her near relation to &s;ee him in the mo&s;t favourable light and to hear him favourably &s;poken of by others, &s;he was blind to the in&s;ipidity and conceited folly of his character. Ha|bit and affection equally con&s;pired to con|ceal his errors from her view; and if &s;he caught occa&s;ionally a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e of his imperfections, his unbounded pro|fe&s;&s;ions of love, added to her tenderne&s;s for him, ca&s;t a partial veil over his de|fects. She acknowledged to her lover,
<PB N="289" REF="294">
that her heart had not been proof again&s;t his a&s;&s;iduities, and that were her parents to agree to their union, her con&s;ent &s;hould follow.</P>
<P>Mr. Par&s;ons's illne&s;s however, which &s;oon after followed, prevented the &s;ub|ject from being mentioned either to him or his lady. Mi&s;s Par&s;ons, from almo&s;t never quitting the bed &s;ide of her father, had few opportunities of entertaining her lover. The family was become anxious and gloomy, and the Captain not finding his re&s;idence &s;o agreeable as formerly, &s;oon left them to join his regiment.</P>
<P>Mr. Par&s;ons's death, which happened a few days after the lover departed, bringing the embarra&s;&s;ment of his affairs to light, informed the Captain too &s;oon that in&s;tead of a very comfortable &s;ettle|ment, (for &s;ome previous windfalls to the family had induced him to conclude that Mi&s;s Par&s;ons would be left in affluent circum&s;tances,) he &s;hould not receive a &s;hilling with his bride.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="295">I hope, Madam, you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, &s;aid &s;he, that in &s;uch circum&s;tances I was not girl enough to remain blind to the many ob&s;tacles which then appeared again&s;t my union with a young &s;oldier, who had little more than his commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on; and fear|ing that from motives of delicacy he might be under difficulties how to act, I wrote to him as &s;oon as grief would al|low me, and laying briefly before him the di&s;advantages of fulfilling our wi&s;hes at that time, &s;ince my mother and I ex|i&s;ted merely upon a &s;mall precarious pen|&s;ion, which depended on her life, added, with many a&s;&s;urances of unalterable af|fection, that till things wore a more fa|vourable a&s;pect, our engagements mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>Would you believe it, Madam! my letter for &s;ix weeks remained unan&s;wered, tho' &s;urely my di&s;mal &s;ituation demanded at lea&s;t the <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> of a man who had &s;o
<PB N="291" REF="296">
lately profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf my lover: and when at length it arrived, it was &s;ome time before I could comprehend the con|tents. It was dated ten days after the receipt of mine; though undoubtedly it could not have taken above a month to come from Liverpool, where his regi|ment was quartered. But this artifice, I afterwards found, was intended to deceive me into an opinion, that it had been written previous to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to &s;ix hundred a year, which had fallen to him by the death of a di&s;tant relation.</P>
<P>In this epi&s;tle, written with the mo&s;t phlegmatic indifference, he pretends, to regard my letter as intended to cancel all our engagements; to which he implicit|ly &s;ubmits with many feigned expre&s;&s;ions of regret.</P>
<P>My conduct, he &s;aid, induced him &s;incerely to wi&s;h that he might never be|hold me more. He called me in&s;en&s;ible, unfeeling, and ungrateful; and after be|&s;towing
<PB N="292" REF="297">
a number of other appellations equally fal&s;e and deceitful, concluded with praying that time and ab&s;ence might enable him to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion, which every line of his letter proved exi&s;ted no more.</P>
<P>On a fir&s;t peru&s;al, I really imagined that &s;ome meaning mi&s;con&s;trued, or &s;ome phraze mi&s;under&s;tood, had given umbrage to my cou&s;in, and in the height of my unea&s;ine&s;s in&s;tantly again wrote to him. I a&s;&s;ured him &s;olemnly that I &s;hould ever regard as &s;acred the engagement into which I had entered with my whole heart, and to fulfil which was it's fir&s;t wi&s;h; and that all I de&s;ired was to po&s;tpone an event that &s;eemed at pre&s;ent mutually imprudent.</P>
<P>This however he thought proper never to acknowledge; and I was &s;oon convin|ced that he had joyfully laid hold of this opportunity to regain his freedom. The conviction of his infidelity co&s;t me many
<PB N="293" REF="298">
&s;ighs; but the death of my dear and re|&s;pected mother &s;oon awakened me to new affliction.</P>
<P>Having been in her la&s;t moments re|commended by her to my aunt, and left &s;olely dependent on her care, I was in|vited, &s;oon after the la&s;t &s;ad duties were performed, to take up my re&s;idence in her family, and began immediately to experience that cruel rever&s;e which has embittered every &s;ucceeding hour. You cannot but have perceived, my dear Mi&s;s Seymour, that my misfortunes have re|duced me almo&s;t to a level with the do|me&s;tics in this hou&s;e. Mrs. Hindon evi|dently regards me, and uniformly treats me as a menial dependent, in&s;tead of cheri&s;hing me with that care which my connexion with her claims and which her &s;olemn promi&s;e to my mother to take charge of me &s;eemed to imply and led me to expect. In lieu of tho&s;e care&s;&s;es, and that admirarion which in my hap|pier
<PB N="294" REF="299">
days any little advantages I po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed never failed to excite, and which made me think with plea&s;ure on &s;pending my days under her protection, I found my aunt was one of tho&s;e who are wholly influenced by &s;ituation and appearances. Seeing me de&s;titute and forlorn, &s;he now regarded me as an orphan whom an o&s;tentation of charity induced her to retain, and who, though entitled as her relation to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, its unavoidable attendants were contempt and degrada|tion.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily imagine, that in my humiliation I met the eyes of my cou&s;in with additional pain. The day on which you dined here, immediately after your arrival, was that on which I &s;aw him for the fir&s;t time: and though I am certain he mu&s;t have felt embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;|concerted at the rencontre, he behaved with a degree of in&s;olence and effrontery which converted my expiring regret (for
<PB N="295" REF="300">
it is not ea&s;y wholly to eradicate a fir&s;t and &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion) into &s;elf congra|tulation and gratitude to heaven that I had been &s;pared a fate &s;o mi&s;erable as that of being connected with a human being capable of &s;uch meanne&s;s and in|delicacy.</P>
<P>I was now in company with Captain Wilmot every day; but we mutually avoided being &s;o without witne&s;&s;es; and &s;ome time elap&s;ed, though probably you never remarked it, before we even exchanged words. The cu&s;tom of &s;ee|ing me has however &s;o entirely con|quered all embarra&s;&s;ment or &s;hame on his part, (if he was ever capable of any) that he has more than once pre&s;umed to treat me with the familiarity due only to an inferior, calling me his pretty Jenny with the impertinent ea&s;e of a man who imagines that in my &s;ituation even his freedoms mu&s;t be well received and dare not be re&s;ented.

<P>The unfortunate girl concluded her &s;tory with tears, in which compa&s;&s;ion made me heartily join.
