<HEAD>LETTER I. FROM HENRY SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>REJOICE with me, dear Edmund, rejoice! for he is gone. Yes! by all the hone&s;t powers, who frown on the un&s;ightly union of age and youth, of decrepitude and beauty, he is departed.&mdash;Aye! my friend, departed, like a &s;hadow as he &s;eemed to be, to the region of &s;pi|rits. That hour, for which you have heard me pant &s;o frequently with all the fervency of an impa&s;&s;ioned &s;oul, that ble&s;&s;ed hour is at length arrived.&mdash;Cornelia, the lovely, the tender, the patient, the dutiful Cornelia is delivered from her Aegyptian bondage; Cornelia is a widow: and what a widow! Oh Heavens! a thou&s;and times more able to exerci&s;e and to gratify the im|perial pa&s;&s;ion of my heart, than all the boa&s;ted virgins that Circa&s;&s;ia could exhibit. You have heard me to rave on her graces, her virtues, her enchantment; and with true philo&s;ophical phlegm, or with a friendly de&s;ign, perhaps, to divert me from what you con&s;idered as a very hopele&s;s attachment, you have told me that my heart is the dupe of my own feveri&s;h imagina|tion. Yes! you argumentative rogue! I per|fectly remember how you employed again&s;t my
<PB N="2" REF="4">
pa&s;&s;ion the united powers of logic and of ridicule. I &s;ee you at this moment with that &s;ingular, va|riable, and intere&s;ting face of yours, in which the rigid frown of Zeno is perpetually mingling with the wanton &s;mile of Epicurus, I &s;ee you arranging your tremendous &s;yllogi&s;ms, and pre|paring to tell me once more, that one of your two po&s;itions mu&s;t be true, that either Cornelia was never half &s;o lovely as I have repre&s;ented her, or if &s;he was once indeed a perfect model of loveline&s;s, that her charms mu&s;t have withered, like the leaves of an unfortunate ro&s;e, barbarou&s;ly &s;tationed under the deadly &s;hade of a decaying yew tree.</P>
<P>I have not, you find, either forgot, or forgiven the abominable metaphor, by which you tried, like a rough empiric as you are, to cure my heart by di&s;gu&s;ting my fancy; a &s;ort of quackery, that is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, very frequently &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and practi&s;ed with marvellous effect, by the women, in their attempts to annihilate the in|fluence of a rival! But let me tell you, prophane wretch as you are,
<Q>Aurora Springing from Tithonus' bed,</Q>
was never half &s;o fre&s;h, &s;o enchanting, &s;o divine, as my angelical widow.&mdash;I call her mine, becau&s;e I feel, that I &s;hall be frantic, if I cannot make her &s;o. Yet that pious barbarian, your brother Charles, told me the other day, with a &s;acerdotal a&s;&s;urance, that I had not religion enough to de|&s;erve, or maintain her; confound his pre&s;ump|tion! were he of any family but yours, I &s;hould think him the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of hypocrites. Becau&s;e he has married the fair buxom daughter of a pomp|ous
<PB N="3" REF="5">
high prie&s;t, the rogue a&s;&s;umes all the arro|gance of the Catholic Church, and thinks he has a right to &s;end to purgatory all who pre&s;ume to act, or to think, in a &s;tyle that differs from his own. He teaches us, to be &s;ure, by his example, a mo&s;t orthodox &s;y&s;tem of happine&s;s, for he ki&s;&s;es no woman but his wife, reads no book but the Bible, and labours hard to reinforce the militia of Heaven with a new party of cherubims, as his good woman, after making him a pre&s;ent of twins but a few months ago, looks already as if &s;he intended to double that favour. Deuce take the fellow! while I am laughing at him, I am almo&s;t ready to envy his felicity, and I ought in|deed to tell you, that with his in&s;olent rebuke to me, which I have mentioned, he mingled &s;uch an air of concern and benevolence, that I felt a &s;trange &s;ort of momentary doubt in my mind, whether I ought to challenge, or to embrace him. As it generally happens in the di&s;agreeable per|plexity of a mixed and equivocal &s;entiment, I did nothing: yet had I been hypocritical, or di&s;creet enough to pur&s;ue my own intere&s;t, in &s;pite of a ruffled &s;pirit, I certainly ought to have embraced him as the deare&s;t friend I have in the world; &s;ince I am &s;ufficiently aware, that he will have great influence on the future de&s;tination of my enchanting widow. You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that as he was the favourite relation of Mr. Sedley, he makes a mo&s;t important figure in his will, as his confidential tru&s;tee for the young widow, and tho&s;e two lovely infants, whom &s;he &s;eemed to have made miraculou&s;ly, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her unequal partner. Pious as he is, I really
<PB N="4" REF="6" MS="y">
believe your brother will manage their ample pro|perty with a faithful di&s;charge of his tru&s;t. If I thought him indeed inclined to play the Jew, or the prie&s;t, (for with me, I confe&s;s, they are almo&s;t &s;ynonymous) I would willingly give him all the wealth of the widow, to &s;ecure me the rapid po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart and hand. Yet I have &s;uch a rooted dete&s;tation of artifice and fal&s;ehood, that I could not play the pious hypo|crite with him for an hour, if I knew it would make me ma&s;ter of the object I adore.&mdash;I mu&s;t however contrive to a&s;&s;ociate as much as po&s;&s;ible with your brother, and the more &s;o as his wife is the bo&s;om friend of my Cornelia. Pray write me word in&s;tantly, if your &s;i&s;ter Lucy is now re&s;iding with you. I hope from the bottom of my &s;oul that &s;he is, as I know that &s;he and your &s;i&s;ter Charles never pa&s;s a week without writ|ing to each other. It is from this quarter alone, that I can at pre&s;ent gain a little un&s;u&s;pected in&s;ight into the heart and &s;pirit of my dear Cornelia. I conjure you by our friend&s;hip to obtain for me all po&s;&s;ible information concerning her plan of life, her thoughts, her feelings, and every minute article relating to her. Ob&s;erve this reque&s;t as you wi&s;h not only to promote the happine&s;s, but to pre&s;erve the exi&s;tence of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO HENRY SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>I REJOICE with you indeed, my dear Sey|mour; but I confe&s;s it is with a fearful joy.&mdash;You know that I am naturally &s;ubject to an anxious timidity concerning tho&s;e I regard; and if my &s;ympathy in your pre&s;ent tran&s;port appears too much cha&s;ti&s;ed by apprehen&s;ion, you will, I hope, impute, what you may at fir&s;t con&s;ider as a deficiency of &s;pirit, to an exce&s;s of affection.&mdash; In truth, you are not only in the very limited number of my deare&s;t confidential Friends, but you are the very Friend, who&s;e peculiar qualities and &s;ituation have filled me, for &s;ome time, with the mo&s;t affectionate &s;olicitude.&mdash;I own to you, that I tremble, le&s;t the mi&s;chievous power of Chance &s;hould con&s;pire with &s;ome of your pecu|liarities, I &s;hould rather &s;ay with your only de|fect, to counteract all the noble advantages you po&s;&s;e&s;s. What young man ever entered the world with more abundant means to render it a &s;cene of chearfulne&s;s and delight! You have an ex|cellent con&s;titution, with an engaging figure; you have an ample fortune, without a &s;ingle in|cumbrance; you have a gay and brilliant ima|gination; you have a warm, a benevolent heart; but allow the frowning Stoic to add, you have a
<PB N="6" REF="8">
precipitancy of &s;pirit, which may rapidly convert all the&s;e in&s;truments or Happine&s;s into &s;ources of Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery.</P>
<P>But I abu&s;e the privilege you allow me of preaching again&s;t your foibles, in giving you a dull unrea&s;onable &s;ermon, when a little timely railler&punc; might not only be more plea&s;ant, but more efficacious. In&s;tead therefore of continu|ing my dictatorial harangue on your imperfec|tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, let me only advi&s;e you not to write an offer of marriage to your widow, while &s;he is adju&s;ting her weeds; nor a challenge to my bro|ther, in con&s;equence of that in&s;upportable pro|vocation&mdash;his feeling a &s;incere wi&s;h to &s;ee you a good Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Though you tell me I love to touch your foi|bles wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the cau&s;tic of &s;arca&s;m, I find that I cannot ju&s;t with any tolerable grace, or ea&s;e, on &s;ubjects that may pre&s;s upon my heart with &s;uch &s;erious weight.</P>
<P>There is hardly a circum&s;tance in life which could give me more pain, than a quarrel between you and my brother: and when I con&s;ider your re&s;pective &s;ituations, I &s;hudder at the probability of &s;uch an event. It would certainly be mo&s;t impolitic in you to offend him at pre&s;ent; yet you have &s;uch an exalted idea of never &s;acrificing your &s;entiments to your intere&s;t, that my caution to you on this ground might he more likely to produce, than to prevent the mi&s;chief, I would guard again&s;t. As I have a mo&s;t cordial affection both for you and my brother, and a much more intimate knowledge of both than you have yet acquired of each other, allow me to inform you,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
that although you differ on one great &s;ubject, there are many points of agreement and re&s;em|blance beween you, that ought to unite us all in a very firm and inviolable friend&s;hip. It was your lot, as you approached towards manhood, to be connected with &s;ome mercenary prie&s;ts, both in humble and high &s;tation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who&s;e ungene|rous conduct in&s;pired, or rather inflamed you, with a vehement prejudice, not only again&s;t their whole order, but again&s;t all per&s;ons who are very zealou&s;ly attached to the Religion they profe&s;s. Youth and plea&s;ure have not hitherto allowed your rea&s;on &s;ufficient time to examine and correct this early, this unfortunate preju|dice; and accident perhaps has repeatedly con|&s;pired with the native ardor of your mind to &s;trengthen the hone&s;t indignant feelings on which it was founded. My brother Charles, though he has neither the habit, nor the occupa|tions of a divine, is indeed a man of as religious a mind, as the church can exhibit: but his Re|ligion, if I may use &s;uch a di&s;tinction, is rather con&s;titutional, than acquired; it ari&s;es more from tenderne&s;s of heart, and &s;en&s;ibility of mind, than from exten&s;ive &s;tudy and profound meditati|on. His piety is the child of Gratitude, not of Fear; and its chief characteri&s;tics are chearful|ne&s;s and benevolence: it is his favorite maxim, that Religion not only takes from us the bitter &s;en&s;e of calamity, but gives a finer ze&s;t to all the plea&s;ures of life. His doctrine is indeed very for|cibly recommended by his example; for he is by many degrees the mo&s;t happy being that I ever knew.&mdash;We all talk you know of God, as our
<PB N="8" REF="10">
general Parent; but few of us, I fear, are able to look up to him with a true filial &s;pirit. Of all the men whom I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in this point of view, Charles, I mu&s;t &s;ay, is the only per&s;on who ever &s;eemed to repo&s;e with the happy affectionate confidence of an innocent child on the bo&s;om of his Creator.</P>
<P>You will begin to &s;u&s;pect that I am metamor|pho&s;ed into a Moravian; or at lea&s;t that I have caught my brother's enthu&s;ia&s;m without his vi|vacity: but to confe&s;s my own weakne&s;s, they are equally beyond ray reach. Connected as we are by nature and by affection, I find there is &s;uch an unalterable difference in our characters, that I might as well attempt to acquire the exact turn of his features, as the peculiar ca&s;t of his mind. When I am in one of my argumentative metaphy&s;ical moods, I rea&s;on my&s;elf into a con|&s;olatory per&s;ua&s;ion that his great &s;uperiority over me, both in goodne&s;s and gaiety, is principally owing to a mechanical felicity of frame.</P>
<P>But I am rambling very far from the main ob|ject of my letter, which is to conjure you not to indulge your wit and imagination in any &s;atirical &s;allies again&s;t the church, and her &s;ons, in the pre&s;ence of my brother. I do not pretend to &s;ay he is right in his maxim, that piety is an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in a good hu&s;band (the Ladies we know are ready enough to grant a di&s;pen&s;ation on this article); but of this I am &s;ure, If Charles is once convinced that you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of outrageous Irreligion, he will la our hard to pre&s;erve your lovely widow from a connexion, which in his idea, mu&s;t be productive of mi&s;ery,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
both to her and her children. If I thought you an ab&s;olute debauchee, I &s;hould be very fearful of giving you &s;uch a hint, becau&s;e I know, in that ca&s;e, what your an&s;wer, or at lea&s;t what your conduct would be. You would engage the amo|rous wi&s;hes of the widow in a conflict with the pious advice of her guardian, for the plea&s;ure of watching the battle, and di&s;covering which would be triumphant. But though we have both of us had more re&s;emblance to the libertine, than to the anchorite, in our adventures, I am per&s;uaded that you have a true and cha&s;te affection for this divine little widow, and of cour&s;e you can never feel a wi&s;h to fill her tender bo&s;om with painful di&s;quietude and contention, when fortune &s;eems to offer you the tranquil acqui&s;ition of her heart and hand. When I thought that your admiration of her charms could only involve you in a hopele&s;s or a dangerous attachment I endeavoured to laugh away your love; but the great change in your Cornelia's &s;ituation has turned me from an opponent into an advocate for your pa&s;&s;ion. I have now only to conjure you, not to throw any &s;tumbling black your&s;elf into the very inviting primro&s;e path, that is ju&s;t opened before you. I can truly &s;ay, to encourage you, that you have as many advantages for the chace of a widow, as a greyhound has for that of a hare; but remember! the greyhound is &s;ometimes apt to overrun his game, and to lo&s;e his prey by the very rap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y which &s;eemed to en&s;ure it. I fore&s;ee and acquie&s;ce in the ju&s;tice of your retort; that I have the &s;low foot of a beagle, and frequently &s;uffer the object of my
<PB N="10" REF="12">
wi&s;hes to e&s;cape me, by the tardine&s;s of my pur|&s;uit. Agreed! but pray recollect what a very u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant the flow dog often proves to the &s;wift one.</P>
<P>That I am highly anxious for your &s;ucce&s;s, you will clearly perceive by my writing you &s;o long a letter, without touching on my own le&s;s delicate amours. Indeed, I &s;hould think it almo&s;t a profanation of your divine Cornelia, if I pre|&s;umed to talk of the wayward Sylvia in the &s;ame page. I will only add therefore that having been wickedly tormented by a mi&s;tre&s;s, I am particu|larly &s;olicitous to &s;ee you religiou&s;ly happy in a wife, and let me clo&s;e that friendly wi&s;h with a devout Amen!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. FROM CORNELIA SEDLEY TO HARRIOT AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! my mo&s;t tender and deare&s;t friend, what a bitter misfortune to me is the pro|voking little accident, which has confined you
<PB N="11" REF="13">
to your chamber at a time when my heart and &s;oul have &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions for your &s;ociety!</P>
<P>Surely I am de&s;tined to be for ever ungrateful; for is there not much ingratitude in this com|plaint, con&s;idering the kind and brotherly atten|tion that I receive from your excellent hu&s;band, and the affectionate manner in which you pre&s;s him to remain at a di&s;tance from you &s;o long as his pre&s;ence here can be any way &s;erviceable to me and my dear little orphans? Your own heart will witne&s;s for me, that I do him only &s;imple ju&s;|tice in &s;aying, that no man in the world could di&s;charge the mournful office, in which he has &s;o graciou&s;ly engaged, with more delicate propriety, or with more &s;oothing friend&s;hip. Indeed, I know not how poor Cornelia could have &s;upported her exi&s;tence without him; for in the week, pre|ceding Mr. Sedley's death, a &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed between us, which annihilated all the little &s;trength of body and mind, with which I had endeavoured to prepare my&s;elf for that mo&s;t aweful expected event. You will conceive the impre&s;&s;ion it made upon me, when I tell you, that I have &s;at down four different days with a firm re&s;olution to give you a minute account of it, and that I have been repeatedly prevented by the bur&s;ting tears of an|gui&s;h and &s;elf-reproach.&mdash;Ah! my dear Harriot, had you been a witne&s;s of that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing conver|&s;ation, you would no more take the part of your &s;elf-reproaching Cornelia. No, you would cer|tainly join with my own heart in telling me, that as I was not happy in being connected with &s;o noble, &s;o elegant, &s;o affectionate a mind as my departed Sedley's, I can never de&s;erve happine&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="14">
on earth. Good Heaven! how &s;trangely does the capricious human &s;pirit admini&s;ter to its own di&s;quietude! How &s;illy a wretch have I been, to live &s;ix years with &s;uch a man, and not love him with true affection, till the very moment in which he &s;eemed to hover in a middle &s;tate be|tween earth and heaven! In truth, he was much more of an angel than a mortal in the heart-piercing conver&s;ation I have mentioned, and of which I will now endeavour to give you the mo&s;t exact narrative in my power.</P>
<P>I &s;hould begin by informing you, that his gloo|my and querulous di&s;po&s;ition, which we found, you know, &s;o grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive in the early periods of his long di&s;order, changed on a &s;ud|den into a kind of &s;eraphic &s;erenity under pain, which excited in all his attendants admiration and reverence. As &s;oon as he found, by a fair trial, that the waters at Bri&s;tol had not the &s;lighte&s;t effect on that internal uncertain malady, which had &s;o often deceived his phy&s;icians, and preyed in &s;o &s;ingular a manner on his wa&s;ting frame, his mind &s;eemed to pa&s;s from a turbulent &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e to a tranquil certainty. He was con|vinced, for the fir&s;t time, that he was very &s;oon to die; and the conviction, in&s;tead of weaken|ing, appeared to give new energy to his &s;pirits, his faculties, and his affections. Repre&s;ent to your&s;elf, my dear Harriot, his wa&s;ted, yet man|ly figure, ten times more emaciated than when you la&s;t beheld him, and his piercing eyes endu|ed, as it were, with a &s;upernatural keenne&s;s, that &s;eemed to &s;earch the &s;oul of every per&s;on on whom he turned them! Behold him wrapt in
<PB N="13" REF="15">
his loo&s;e coat of blue velvet, which you &s;portive|ly u&s;ed to call his imperial robe, and reclining on a &s;opha, in a &s;ilent conflict with internal pain. Behold your Cornelia preparing for her morning ta&s;k of reading to the poor &s;ufferer, after the removal of our breakfa&s;t, at which he had endured as u&s;ual extreme torture on the fir&s;t reception of a little food into his &s;to|mach. His pangs had &s;ub&s;ided, and he had made me a &s;ignal to open the volume of Shak&s;peare which I held in my hand, when, in|&s;tead of obeying it immediately, I ventured to &s;ay, "If you are per&s;uaded that Bri&s;tol does not &s;uit your complaint, why do you not move from an inconvenient lodging into one of your own comfortable hou&s;es?" He fixed upon me tho&s;e eyes of inexpre&s;&s;ible quickne&s;s; and after a moment's pau&s;e he replied, "I will tell you, my dear Cornelia, very frankly: I wi&s;h to die here, becau&s;e I wi&s;h to leave you no ve&s;tiges of a wretch|ed &s;cene in either of tho&s;e habitations, where I hope you are &s;oon to lead a life of quiet, and in due time of joy." His expre&s;&s;ion &s;truck me in a manner which it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to de|&s;cribe: I felt in it a mixture of the tendere&s;t &s;o|licitude, and of half di&s;gui&s;ed reproach; it di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me to &s;uch a degree, that I could not utter a &s;yllable; but my face, I believe, was co|vered with an half-guilty blu&s;h; and tears &s;tarted into my eyes. He ob&s;erved my confu&s;ion with pity, and drew me ha&s;tily towards him. While he was affectionately pre&s;&s;ing one of my hands, the book &s;lipt from the other, and accidentally fell open. His quick eye darted on the page be|fore
<PB N="14" REF="16">
him, and he in&s;tantly exclaimed: Here are words that &s;uit my pre&s;ent feelings exactly; it is my wi&s;h to de&s;erve this character from you, my dear Cornelia, and to leave it engraven on your heart:
<Q><L>Nothing in his life</L>
<L>Became him, like the leaving it&mdash;He died</L>
<L>As one that had been &s;tudied in his death.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have indeed no trea&s;ons to confe&s;s; but I have pardon to implore! Let me now &s;ay to you, my deare&s;t Cornelia, what pride and ill humour have hitherto prevented my &s;aying as I ought&mdash; let me &s;ay, that I mo&s;t cordially implore your pardon for many, many &s;en&s;ations of pain and depre&s;&s;ion, with which the peevi&s;h and moro&s;e &s;pirit of my di&s;temper, for I will not call it mine, has unju&s;tly afflicted you."

I was on the point of uttering a very &s;olemn promi&s;e on the religious article he mentioned, when his phy&s;i|cian entered the room.&mdash;Enough! my dear Cornelia, cried the generous Sedley; and ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf immediately to his medical friend, he &s;aid, with an air of calm Chri&s;tian triumph in his countenance, You find me, Doctor, as your benevolent &s;pirit would wi&s;h to find a patient whom no art can re&s;tore.

During the greater part of my poor Sedley's di&s;cour&s;e to me, my whole frame was agitated with a conflict of oppo&s;ite &s;en|&s;ations: of reverence and regret; admiration of him, and abhorrence of my&s;elf. My heart indeed made &s;everal efforts to relieve it&s;elf by tears; but they were repeatedly checked by the reflection, that it was ungenerous and cruel to

With him there|fore I wept but little; as &s;oon as I had e&s;caped to my own chamber, I began to weep indeed, like a penitent who wi&s;hed to efface the offences of many years. Reflecting however that I had &s;till a more painful duty to di&s;charge, I prayed mo&s;t devoutly for &s;trength and &s;pirits to watch over the poor &s;ufferer, with the mo&s;t tender and ince&s;&s;ant attention, through every remaining hour of a life &s;o rapidly ha&s;tening to its clo&s;e.

We religiou&s;ly obeyed this injunction, which was given on the Thur&s;day; and I believe he did not utter ten words on the two following days; but on the fatal Sunday he reque&s;ted me to join him in a &s;hort and fervent prayer, which he had compo&s;ed and written for the purpo&s;e.&mdash; I could hardly articulate the words, which he pronounced in a low voice, yet very di&s;tinctly,

<HEAD>LETTER V. FROM HENRY SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I Have &s;een&mdash;I have talked with&mdash;I have touched her, and the fire of that electrical touch is &s;till dancing in my veins, though I am &s;itting &s;upperle&s;s in a di&s;mal inn; where, in|&s;tead of ha&s;tening either to &s;upper or to bed, as the time of night would induce any le&s;s amorous or more fortunate mortal to do, I &s;eize the &s;tump of a pen that has &s;erved, I &s;uppo&s;e, a hundred travellers to write their adventures, to give you a hi&s;tory of mine.&mdash;Ah! if your inhuman brother were not as cruel as a prie&s;t, I &s;hould have en|joyed the happine&s;s of pa&s;&s;ing this night under the roof that protects my adored Cornelia;&mdash;yet I mu&s;t &s;ay the pious Barbarian behaved very hand&s;omely, all things con&s;idered.&mdash;Let me how|ever
<PB N="30" REF="32">
grow a little more methodical, and tell you the&s;e intere&s;ting occurrences in their due order.</P>
<P>To avail my&s;elf with the be&s;t grace imaginable of your kind hint where I might catch a &s;ight of my Cornelia, I ordered po&s;t hor&s;es before I had perfectly peru&s;ed your friendly letter, and ha&s;ten|ed to the hou&s;e of a certain hone&s;t dull '&s;quire, who re&s;ides about thirty miles we&s;t of your bro|ther; and who, with many pre&s;&s;ing invitations, could never tempt me before to pay him a &s;hoot|ing vi&s;it. Here I did penance for three days: my good ho&s;t, you know, has a head like his gun-barrel, full of nothing but powder and &s;hot; but had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the wit of Athens, and the urbanity of Rome, I &s;hould, I believe, have thought him a woeful companion, while he de|tained me from that dear object of my idolatry, to whom my &s;pirit had fled before my limbs could reach her. At la&s;t the three days, that appeared to me three centuries, expired, and I &s;et forth for your brother's. Heavens! what a variety of inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;ations I felt in pa&s;&s;ing Sedley-Hall! The &s;ight of the hatchment, the open windows of Cornelia's chamber, and every ob|ject of the &s;pot, &s;truck in &s;ome forcible manner on my heart, and produced altogether a &s;trange agitation, in which hope and fear, melancholy and exultation, were whim&s;ically blended. I felt I know not what &s;atisfaction in contemplating this de&s;erted abode of the lovely mourner, that I wi&s;h to make the &s;miling &s;cene of our future fe|licity; yet, as I pa&s;&s;ed the recent grave of poor Sedley, I felt a cold involuntary pang &s;hoot athwart my bo&s;om&mdash;Were I inclined to &s;uper|&s;tition,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
I &s;hould &s;ay that his &s;pirit &s;mote me as I cro&s;&s;ed his tomb, and forbade me to indulge the ambition of my heart: but my love is too warm and vigorous to be repre&s;&s;ed by phantoms; were a legion of gho&s;ts to ri&s;e in her defence, they &s;hould not bar me from my pur&s;uit: indeed &s;uch a legion would not be half &s;o formidable as that &s;ingle watchful dragon&mdash;your brother. I believe it was a &s;curvy dread of encountering his keen eyes in too long a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te before dinner, which tempted me to loiter &s;o in the precincts of Sedley-Hall; I reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion of the old porter there, to avail my&s;elf of the private road which leads through a little &s;tring of farms by which Sedley and your brother have very lately con|nected their re&s;pective domains. I contrived to reach Charles's gate ju&s;t as the fir&s;t bell was &s;um|moning the good folks of his hou&s;ehold to a pre|paration for dinner, and as I entered the hall I met him ju&s;t come in through the garden-door from a long and dirty walk. I felt, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, more like a thief than a friend; but put|ting the be&s;t face I could on my unexpected in|tru&s;ion, I told him I had taken the liberty of &s;topping to dine with him, in my road from the we&s;t.&mdash;He gave me a very polite welcome: I thought I di&s;covered in it more of civility than of joy; and this idea did not tend to dimini&s;h my embarra&s;&s;ment; but, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible re|lief, in a few minutes he left me alone in his library, while he retired to change his dre&s;s. My heart now began to palpitate at the &s;ound of a female foot in the room above. I had not dared to enquire after the widow; and he, perhaps
<PB N="32" REF="34">
from delicacy, had not named her to me. A &s;er|vant luckily entering the library, I &s;eized the opportunity of inquiring if there was any com|pany in the hou&s;e, and if Mrs. Audley was &s;uffi|ciently recovered from her late accident to dine below. The fellow's an&s;wer was &s;o exactly what I wi&s;hed, that I con&s;idered him as my good angel, and was ready to wor&s;hip him for his ble&s;&s;ed intell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gence. In cro&s;&s;ing the hall, at the &s;ound of the &s;econd bell, I caught the fir&s;t &s;ight of my angelic Cornelia, employed, angel-like, in &s;upporting the unea&s;y &s;tep of her di&s;abled friend. I had the delight of gazing on them for a minute unperceived, as they came &s;lowly down &s;tairs. In my fir&s;t compliment I could not help remarking the very touching graces of the po&s;ition in which I &s;urprized them, and I expre&s;&s;ed my wonder that the painters had not more frequently &s;eized a &s;ubject &s;o delightful as that of one lovely woman engaged in &s;ome act of friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance to another. "O, cried your lively &s;i&s;ter, I am afraid the painters, like the greater part of your &s;ex, are a &s;et of wicked creatures, who have no faith in female friend|&s;hip; but you have luckily hit on a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;ona|ble piece of flattery; for I was &s;aying to my kind friend here this morning, that if we ever fit for our pictures again, it &s;hall be in the cha|racters of Celia and Ro&s;alind: for my part (&s;he continued with that graceful vivacity which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es you know in a &s;ingular degree) I think there is more female heroi&s;m in confining your|&s;elf to wait on a cripple, than in wandering with an exile through the plea&s;ant fore&s;t of Arden." My heart and tongue were both eager to exclaim:
<PB N="33" REF="35">
"How ble&s;t the man who might become the Oli|ver to your Celia!" But the &s;udden appearance of your brother annihilated at once my courage and my compliment. Our dinner, I believe, would have pa&s;&s;ed very heavily, had not your en|gaging &s;i&s;ter gradually contrived to di&s;&s;ipate the general con&s;traint, and to impart a portion of her own ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s to the little circle round her. She de&s;erves in truth to be painted in the character of Ro&s;alind, for &s;he can indeed "do &s;trange things," and &s;eems to have <Q>con|ver&s;ed with a magician mo&s;t profound in his art, and yet not damnable.</Q> She read my heart and &s;oul with that quick intuition with which clever women comprehend all the feelings of a man in love, before he can thoroughly de|cypher them him&s;elf. She rallied me on my vi|&s;it to the &s;hooting &s;quire, and did it with that &s;portive delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion that &s;he neither di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me nor my tender widow by her rail|lery; though I &s;aw that &s;he perfectly knew what magnet had drawn me to her table. As I am naturally &s;anguine, you know I &s;oon felt my&s;elf in&s;pirited by the kindne&s;s of her reception. I thought her eyes &s;aid to me, I read and applaud your pa&s;&s;ion for Cornelia; it is impo&s;&s;ible for her at pre&s;ent to afford you any thing like encourage|ment; but I, who am her &s;econd-&s;elf, and know all her thoughts, will do all that I dare to in&s;pire you with hope. This idea gave me new life: at the clo&s;e of dinner a very whim&s;ical little inci|dent happpened, which, trivial as it may appear, I mu&s;t relate to you at full length, becau&s;e it filled us all with no unplea&s;ant emotion. While
<PB N="34" REF="36">
the &s;ervants were &s;etting the wine on the table, the elde&s;t of the little Sedleys, the mo&s;t lovely and wonderful child of five years that I ever &s;aw, came running furiou&s;ly into the room: his beau|tiful little countenance was illuminated with a brave indignation; I never beheld &s;uch an image of an infant hero; and we &s;oon found that he came on a very heroic errand; for, as &s;oon as he could collect breath enough to &s;peak, he made a very &s;pirited appeal to the alarmed Cornelia again&s;t the tyranny of Nur&s;e, who was going to inflict a corporal puni&s;hment that he thought very unju&s;t on his little brother: I &s;hall never forget the tone and manner of this marvellous boy&mdash;"My papa, &s;aid the infant hero, told me, that when he was gone to Heaven I &s;hould be the protector of little Charles, and nobody &s;hall whip him for &s;uch a trifle!" He uttered this with &s;uch an enchanting air of infantine magnanimity, that I could not help catching him up in my arms, and exclaiming, "Heaven ble&s;s thee, &s;weet boy, thou wilt be one of the noble&s;t-minded men that God ever created!" I perceived a tear of maternal tran&s;port ru&s;h to the eye of my Cor|nelia; &s;he was greatly affected, and was going to quit the room to regulate this petty di&s;tur|bance; but your brother &s;topt her, by in&s;i&s;ting on his prerogative, as Lord paramount of the nur&s;ery, and confined her under the guard of his wife, while he and the little Sedley went together to examine and redre&s;s the grievance.</P>
<P>I defy you to gue&s;s in a twelve-month the high crime and mi&s;demeanour by which the infant-culp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it had excited the anger of his nur&s;e&mdash;
<PB N="35" REF="37">
Apropos of nur&s;e&mdash;You, who&s;e idea of beauty is always connected with that of fertility, and who think a woman never &s;o tempting as when &s;he has a child in her arms; you, I &s;ay, would have been frantic at the &s;ight of this beautiful nur&s;e; and beautiful indeed you will &s;uppo&s;e her to be, when I confe&s;s that I could not help &s;taring at her in the pre&s;ence of my adored Cornelia&mdash;it was a &s;tare of admiration, not of licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and to prove to you that it was &s;o, when I marry the lovely widow I will &s;end you this admirable creature for your hou&s;ekeeper. You dread, I know, the galling yoke of Hymen, and you can never find a more eligible &s;ub&s;titute for a wi&s;e; &s;he is completely in your favourite &s;tyle of beauty&mdash;&s;o rich, &s;o luxuriant, &s;o &s;mi|ling&mdash; in &s;hort, a land flowing with milk and honey.</P>
<P>But to return to the infant culprit, and his inconceivable offence&mdash; Ble&s;s the gay little ur|chin! his crime was nothing more nor le&s;s than a kind hint to me to &s;horten the mourning of his mother, whom Nature fa&s;hioned for joy. It &s;eems the lively urchin, who is &s;till in petticoats, has taken a plea&s;ant aver&s;ion to black; as he was ju&s;t equipped to make his appearance in the parlour in a clean white frock and a new broad black &s;a&s;h, the rogue contrived to &s;eize a large pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and made &s;everal tremendous ga&s;hes in the gloomy decoration of his dre&s;s, which he could not reconcile to his joyous ima|gination. This had excited the anger and me|naces of nur&s;e, and the generous interference of his elder brother, who exulted not a little
<PB N="36" REF="38">
when Audley returned to us, as he &s;oon did, with the little rebel in his arms, unwhipt, and beginning to &s;mile again, with cheeks like two crim&s;on ro&s;es, and with two forgotten tears &s;tand|ing like dew-drops in the middle of each. My divine Cornelia di&s;played a great deal of maternal tenderne&s;s, but with infinite good &s;en&s;e, and without a grain of affection. She thought her&s;elf bound to chide the young delinquent a little for the &s;ake of vindicating the honour and the authority of nur&s;e. Your brother, with much good humour and plea&s;antry, played the advocate for his little name&s;ake, and made him very happy by a promi&s;e to replace his hateful black ribband by a new one of &s;ky colour. As there was no mode in which I could venture to make immediate love to my tender widow, ex|cept by care&s;&s;ing and trying to ingratiate my&s;elf with her children, you will &s;uppo&s;e I was very a&s;&s;iduous in that attempt; and I was luckily &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that I &s;oon became the prime favourite of both: never did favourite obtain the influence he wi&s;hed, with le&s;s hypocri&s;y and adulation; I was in truth the idolater I profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf. O my divine Cornelia, &s;uch is the magic of thy charms, they communicate an inexpre&s;&s;ible at|traction to all that belongs to thee! I prote&s;t to Heaven, I do not believe it po&s;&s;ible for me to contemplate any offspring of my own either with admiration or with love &s;uperior to what I felt in gazing on thy children. You know, my dear Edmund, that I have always had a &s;ingu|lar plea&s;ure in the &s;ociety of &s;uch artle&s;s little folks; it is one of my favourite amu&s;ements to
<PB N="37" REF="39">
ob&s;erve the free play of un&s;ophi&s;ticated nature, in their looks, their attitudes, their expre&s;&s;ions. The heroi&s;m of the elder Sedley inchanted me, and I was indebted to the younger urchin for a tran&s;port &s;till more delightful. The &s;turdy rogue did not reli&s;h the mild rebuke of his mother, but began to pout like a young Achilles, and turned his face from her with a &s;ulky grandeur. I undertook to negotiate a peace between them, and contrived, as proxy for the little half-penitent rebel, to imprint a ki&s;s of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive homage on her imperial hand&mdash;imperial I may truly call it, as I felt in touching it by this &s;portive ma|noeuvre, that every fibre of my frame acknow|ledged its &s;overeign &s;way. I trembled at my own pre&s;umption, though in childi&s;h &s;port; and if my divine Cornelia had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed le&s;s &s;implicity of character, or le&s;s under&s;tanding, my freedom might have produced a very fooli&s;h and very aukward &s;cene; but, with a grace and delicacy of manner that no words can de&s;cribe, &s;he ac|cepted my homage as the act of her child, and &s;eemed not a little obliged to me in her heart for having furni&s;hed her with an early pretence for admitting the little half-&s;ullen and half-recon|ciled rebel to her lap.</P>
<P>When the ladies withdrew, which they did not without a kind memento from your &s;i&s;ter that I mu&s;t drink tea with them before I proceed|ed in my journey, your brother, in a vein of arch ho&s;pitality, plied me with &s;ome excellent wine; not forgetting the health of his lovely gue&s;t: I drank freely, in the hope of imbibing courage enough to open my heart to him on the
<PB N="38" REF="40">
great object of its ambition; but the &s;anctified rogue looked at me with &s;o piercing an eye that he disjointed the exordium of an oration that I was &s;tudying for this purpo&s;e: I believe he com|prehended my de&s;ign, and my want of a&s;&s;urance to accompli&s;h it; for ju&s;t as we were &s;ummoned to attend the ladies at their tea table, he &s;ur|pri&s;ed me by the following &s;peech: <Q>My young and agreeable traveller, do not think me an inho&s;pitable Barbarian for not a&s;king you to pa&s;s the night under my roof. Come, Sey|mour, I will be very frank with you; I tru&s;t you know enough of me to know that I dete&s;t every thing like di&s;gui&s;e and duplicity. I am perfectly aware of your &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion for the very beautiful and amiable woman now under my protection; if the vehemence of love does not blind your own excellent judgment, you will perceive on reflection that I could not invite you to remain with us in this early pe|riod of her widowhood, without failing in the delicate regard that I owe to the character and the feelings of my lovely charge; but give me your hand, and be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;o far from being an enemy to your well-placed affection, I only wi&s;h to find every po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on that may enable me in due time to a&s;|&s;i&s;t and befriend it.</Q> I caught his extended hand in a tran&s;port of gratitude, and could not help pre&s;&s;ing it to my lips, as the hand of a gracious monarch who had ju&s;t rai&s;ed an a&s;piring and anxious &s;ubject to the pinnacle of honour and of joy. Alas! my gratitude, as you tell me all my pa&s;&s;ions are inclined to be, was much
<PB N="39" REF="41">
too precipitate. Hear how the Barbarian pro|ceeded: "I am di&s;po&s;ed to regard you, Seymour, as the bo&s;om friend of a brother who is very dear to me; you have many of his be&s;t quali|ties, but you have al&s;o (&s;hall I &s;ay) his defect, or his misfortune: I &s;ee you under&s;tand me but too well, by the angry fire which is kindling in your countenance; but dive into your own heart, and a&s;k it fairly, if you have any ju&s;t cau&s;e of anger again&s;t a man who is kindly &s;hew|ing you what he knows to be the only ob&s;tacle in your road to happine&s;s." I was aba&s;hed, I own, by the tenderne&s;s of this reproof; the ha&s;ty and indignant &s;peech I had upon my tongue died away without reaching my lips; and I &s;ate like a &s;inner in &s;ilent confu&s;ion, while the triumphant preacher thus continued his di&s;|cour&s;e: "You will acquit me of impertinence in hinting thus remotely at this very &s;erious &s;ub|ject, when you know that I have &s;ome material information to give you concerning it. I need not tell you that my relation, poor Sedley, had, with all his infirmities, a &s;trong under&s;tand|ing, a &s;incere attachment to religion, and a per|fect &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;ery which a want of that attachment introduces &s;ooner or later into all the conditions of human life. In leaving a beau|tiful, young, and rich woman, in a world full of various temptations, he was too wi&s;e to ex|pect or to wi&s;h that &s;he &s;hould not marry again; but his knowledge and his goodne&s;s induced him to expre&s;s to her a peculiar &s;olicitude that &s;he &s;hould never marry an irreligious man: her re|&s;olution on this point is &s;ettled; and though a
<PB N="40" REF="42">
libertine might laugh at the idea, it has been &s;et|tled by circum&s;tances of &s;uch uncommon &s;olem|nity, that I que&s;tion if any human temptations could lead her to renounce or forget it. The vows of a widow, you may tell me, are prover|bially frail. I have not forgot our common ac|quaintance, the fair matron of Ephe&s;us; but neither you nor I can look upon Cornelia as a creature of that cla&s;s. If indeed, it were po&s;|&s;ible for her to waver, my own &s;entiments, and the duty I owe both to the dead and to the living, mu&s;t oblige me to exert all the influence I po&s;&s;e&s;s to confirm her in &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o important a re|&s;olution. You are very young, Seymour; and it is your misfortune, as it was your friend Edmund's before you, to be acquainted with a &s;et of lively and too agreeable infidels, who have led you both, I fear, very wide of that rock upon which alone it is po&s;&s;ible to build human happine&s;s! You both, I am afraid, con&s;ider Religion either as a ma&s;k that hypocrites a&s;&s;ume for their intere&s;t, or, at be&s;t, as a grave bauble for old age to play with. I tru&s;t the time will come, when you will both entertain a much truer idea of it, when you will both agree with me in thinking, that the very beautiful enco|mium which Tully be&s;tows on Literature, is &s;till more applicable to Religion, that it is "the friend of every &s;ea&s;on and &s;ituation, the guard and ornament of pro&s;perity, the refuge of af|fliction." But, I a&s;k your pardon, the ladies expect you; a &s;ingle glance from the woman you love will have a much better chance of con|verting you than fifty &s;ermons of mine. I will
<PB N="41" REF="43">
only &s;ay, detach your&s;elf from your profane a&s;|&s;ociates, make your&s;elf religiou&s;ly worthy of the divine Cornelia, and I &s;hall have infinite delight in placing her in the arms of a man &s;o accom|pli&s;hed. And now, having ventured to do it thus metaphorically, let me literally &s;hew you the way to her, by conducting you up &s;tairs. Without waiting far a reply, which in truth I hardly knew how to make, he led me to the drawing-room. There was certainly much of the friend in his addre&s;s to me, but there was al&s;o a bitter da&s;h of the par&s;on and the dictator that I was unable to &s;wallow: as I followed him up &s;tairs my proud &s;plenetic fancy for a moment &s;ubdued even my love. I con&s;idered Cornelia her|&s;elf, in a &s;arca&s;tic point of view, as a new &s;ort of Penelope, who was to make a trial of her lo|vers, not by a &s;trong bow, but by the number of chapters they could read in the Bible; but the in&s;tant I beheld her lovely angelical figure at the tea-table, every particle of my pride and &s;pleen evaporated. I flew, all joy and tender|ne&s;s, to her &s;ide; and while her &s;nowy hand was gracefully pre&s;enting a di&s;h of tea to me, I was ready to exclaim, from the book I have ju&s;t mentioned, <Q>Intreat me not to leave thee (or to return from following after thee) for whither thou goe&s;t I will go: and where thou lodge&s;t I will lodge; thy people &s;hall be my people, and thy God my God.</Q></P>
<P>But I repre&s;&s;ed my rapture, or rather adopted a mode of indulging it, which, in&s;tead of being exceptionable, was &s;ure of exciting &s;ympathy and approbation. I talked to Cornelia of her chil|dren.
<PB N="42" REF="44">
I dwelt on the engaging pre&s;age of a fine manly character, which the little incident after dinner had &s;hewn us in her elder boy. She li&s;|tened to me with vi&s;ible delight. I am convinc|ed there is no mode of attacking the heart of a truly amiable widow &s;o effectual as that of mak|ing her own child &s;erve you in the character of Cupid. It has &s;ome advantages over the &s;trata|gem which Venus her&s;elf employed in behalf of Aeneas, when &s;he conveyed the fictitious Iulus to the lap of poor Dido, and the urchin, in &s;eeming only to repo&s;e on her bo&s;om, &s;et it &s;e|cretly on fire. As I think my&s;elf, without va|nity, a much hone&s;ter man than the pious Aene|as, who, like the religious ra&s;cals of every age, played a thou&s;and dirty tricks in the name of Heaven, I tru&s;t that my dalliance in its end will be very different from his, and that I &s;hall turn my widow into a happy wife, in&s;tead of driving the fair creature to hang her&s;elf; a fate that the generous Dido could not &s;urely de&s;erve, even for the extreme folly of having &s;urrendered her charms to a &s;niveling, canting, treacherous hypocrite, who had the impudence to call him|&s;elf a hero.</P>
<P>But I find, to my infinite &s;urprize, that I have been writing half the night; it is time for me to get to bed, and no longer per&s;ecute either you or the poor chamber-maid and waiter; who, having exhau&s;ted all the little worn-out love that they have for each other, are yawning and cur&s;ing the &s;trange gentleman for writing at &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable hours. The conclu&s;ion of my day's adventure may be told in few words: after
<PB N="43" REF="45">
a very &s;hort hour's conver&s;ation, which turned chiefly on the education of children, and the force of female friend&s;hip, I tore my&s;elf from the pre&s;ence of my divine Cornelia; and the pain that I felt in doing &s;o, made me, I appre|hend, very aukward and very ungracious, in taking leave of my ho&s;t. Every circle of the wheels that conveyed me from his hou&s;e &s;eemed to rai&s;e a new re&s;ervoir of &s;pleen in my bo&s;om; and before I reached your old acquaintance, mine ho&s;te&s;s of the Garter, who, by the way, is half dead with dram-drinking, I had devoted your pious brother to all the devils, for a per|ver&s;e provoking Methodi&s;t, who would per&s;uade a blooming widow, full of warm de&s;ires, not to admit an hone&s;t man to her bed till &s;he had heard him repeat his Catechi&s;m. Adieu! I am as &s;ick and as full of &s;pight as a monkey half-&s;tarved by a mi&s;er who pretends to feed and care&s;s it. I am however willing to per&s;uade my&s;elf, that the greater part of my malady ari&s;es from my horror of the few en&s;uing months in which it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me to catch another &s;ight of my dear idol. You may do much towards my cure, if you can fill up this dreadful void in my exi&s;tence by employing me in your &s;ervice.

<HEAD>LETTER VI. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO HENRY SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>AS you &s;eem &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to condemn the waywardne&s;s of your own agitated &s;pi|rit, and your &s;plenetic inju&s;tice to my brother, I will &s;pare you the lecture you de&s;erve on that copious topic. Matters of a more grievous na|ture demand our attention; you wi&s;h me to fur|ni&s;h you with &s;ome intere&s;ting occupation!
<PB N="45" REF="47">
Alas! my dear Seymour, I am but too able to comply with your reque&s;t: I can in&s;tantly em|ploy you, not in my &s;ervice indeed, but in that of humanity; if you have lei&s;ure, as I know you have &s;pirit enough, to embark in a very mournful office, that mu&s;t co&s;t you a great deal of time, and may involve you in great trouble and expence; but, on the other hand, it will afford you the delight of atchieving the mo&s;t charitable exploit, and, of cour&s;e, rai&s;e you high in the e&s;timation of your divine Cornelia, But why do I trifle, in &s;ugge&s;ting intere&s;ted mo|tives, to engage a heart like yours in the &s;uccour of a lovely afflicted creature, whom calamity has vi&s;ited in a &s;trange land; it is a beautiful foreign|er, quite unknown to you, and bowed to the earth by the &s;evere&s;t angui&s;h that I ever &s;aw a female boom endure, whom I wi&s;h you (as &s;oon as I can re&s;tore her a little more to her&s;elf) to con|vey back to the hou&s;e of an ill-judging father, which &s;he de&s;erted in a moment of natural anger and ill-&s;tarred affection. I will give you the wretched &s;tory as briefly as I can: I believe you once &s;aw a young friend of mine, who&s;e name was Peverell; yes, I recollect you &s;aw him, by your having remarked that he was the mo&s;t perfect model of manly beauty that you ever beheld. Alas! my dear Seymour, tears drop upon my paper while I tell you that his fine form, which was every way inferior to his &s;oul, has been &s;uddenly da&s;hed to pieces, by an accident too hideous for de&s;cription! You, who know the warmth of my friend&s;hip, will conceive what I felt on the fir&s;t horrible &s;urpri&s;e of this intelli|gence.
<PB N="46" REF="48">
The unexpected death of a being, &s;o young and &s;o accompli&s;hed, mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in any &s;tate; but there are peculiar circum&s;tances that render the angui&s;h of this event inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;evere. Peverell loved me as you love me, and made me the confident, or rather the guide and ruler of his mo&s;t &s;ecret concerns: in a very neat but &s;mall cottage, that belongs to me, and &s;tands in a mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot about a mile from my hou&s;e, he had depo&s;ited the concealed trea&s;ure of his once warm and gallant heart, the lovely foreigner I have mentioned. She is the child of an old and rich merchant in Genoa, in who&s;e hou&s;e my lo&s;t friend re&s;ided a con&s;iderable time: the young couple were in&s;tructors to each other in their re&s;pective languages, and &s;oon conceiv|ed a vehement and mutual pa&s;&s;ion. Poor Peve|rell, who&s;e mind had a &s;trong natural bia&s;s to every thing honourable, thought &s;eriou&s;ly of marriage, and &s;ounded the father. The old man took care to make both parties comprehend, that he would &s;ooner put the girl into a grave, than into the arms of any man who was not a per&s;on of rank in his own republic; and &s;he, in the height of her in&s;ulted love, very naturally thought, that a father de&s;erved to lo&s;e his child for a &s;entiment &s;o proud and inhuman: &s;he per|&s;uaded the man &s;he adored, who was indeed as worthy of her idolatry as a human being could be, to decamp &s;uddenly with apparent indigna|tion, promi&s;ing to join him in &s;ecret at the fir&s;t &s;ea-port, and embark with him for England. Her character is one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular that I ever met with in her &s;ex: from the &s;teady ar|dour
<PB N="47" REF="49">
and energy of her mind, we might &s;uppo&s;e her an antient Roman. On her landing here, &s;he declined the immediate offer of a private marriage, from a generous idea that it might ruin the man &s;he idolized, as &s;he knew his depen|dence on a rich and ambitious uncle; all I wi&s;h, &s;he &s;aid, at pre&s;ent, is to have the delight of feeling my&s;elf indebted to you for innocence and freedom: had I remained with my father, he would have forced me into marriage with a wretch I de&s;pi&s;e; and mi&s;ery might have led me, as it leads many others, into all the enormities of guilt. I con&s;ider my&s;elf as your wife in the eye of Heaven; and I care not for the opinions of earth: I have a pride and delight in conti|nuing an ab&s;olute dependant on your love, be|cau&s;e I know your heart &s;ufficiently to be a&s;&s;ured that you never abandon a woman for an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>With the&s;e romantic &s;entiments, and with a marvellous and mo&s;t engaging &s;implicity of life and manners, the lovely Giuliana had lived al|mo&s;t two months under my private in&s;pec|tion, attended by a little female orphan, whom &s;he treats rather as a younger &s;i&s;ter than a &s;er|vant, as the girl, who&s;e age is about twelve, is particularly endeared to her, by being the daughter of her decea&s;ed nur&s;e, and of an un|fortunate hone&s;t fellow who lo&s;t his life in trying to recover &s;ome &s;hipwrecked merchandi&s;e of her father's. The charms, the character, and the &s;ituation, of Giuliana, &s;oon made me love her as a &s;i&s;ter or a child; and I urged the poor ill-fated Peverell to try his influence with his uncle

Sir Richard, and, without confe&s;&s;ing the &s;ecret of the lady's pre&s;ence in England, to obtain his con&s;ent to marry the object of his ardent affec|tion, by de&s;cribing her, as &s;he really is, the beau|tiful daughter of an opulent father. I had re|ceived a letter from my friend, who had left us for this purpo&s;e, to tell me, he &s;aw little po&s;&s;ibi|lity of &s;ucceeding with his uncle; and I was writing him a long letter of advice, when his faithful valet, a mo&s;t excellent and kind-heart|ed fellow, entered my &s;tudy, more like a &s;pec|tre than a living man; this good creature, whom I &s;hall love as long as I exi&s;t, for his fidelity and feeling, had rode to tell me, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, what he could not utter when he &s;tood by my &s;ide; he had only voice enough to &s;ay, "Oh, Sir&mdash;my dear ma&s;ter!"&mdash;and &s;unk in a kind of hy&s;teric fit, from the united effects of &s;orrow, emptine&s;s, and fatigue. When I had a little re|&s;tored him, he related to me the horrid calamity occa&s;ioned by an unruly hor&s;e; and as he de|&s;cribed the death of my poor friend with all the &s;trong pathos of genuine affliction, our tears flowed apace, when the feeling Robert &s;uddenly exclaimed to me, "Ah, Sir, we have rea&s;on to weep for him, for he loved us both; but what will that tender &s;oul poor madam Giuliana do!&mdash;O Sir, I can never tell her he is dead! &mdash; No; I had rather be da&s;hed to pieces my&s;elf than tell her!

Alas! poor lady&mdash;left all alone in a &s;trange country! But as long as I live &s;he &s;hall never want a &s;ervant; and I am &s;ure, Sir, you will be a kind friend to her."&mdash;&mdash;This heart-felt eulogy and lamentation from an hone&s;t do|me&s;tic proved of infinite &s;ervice to me; for the artle&s;s and pathetic manner in which the poor fellow delivered it, drew from me a very plenti|ful &s;hower of tears, which rendered me much fitter than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been to en|gage in the mournful duty that he &s;o feelingly recommended to my attention. My fir&s;t care was to recruit the exhau&s;ted frame of the faithful Robert him&s;elf: having ordered him into a warm bed, I &s;ate my&s;elf on the &s;ide of it, to be &s;ure of keeping him quiet, and to meditate on the be&s;t plan of preparing poor Giuliana for a calamity which was &s;oon to change her pre&s;ent chearful|ne&s;s into the deepe&s;t affliction My meditation was &s;oon di&s;turbed, by the &s;tarts of poor Ro|bert, who no &s;ooner got a little &s;lumber than it was broken by terrific vi&s;ions of his ma&s;ter's man|gled body, or of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Giuliana. As the latter &s;eemed to dwell mo&s;t on his &s;pirit, I hoped to make the good fellow's compa&s;&s;ion admini&s;ter to his own recovery, by telling him (what in|deed I believed) that nothing could pre&s;erve his mi&s;tre's from immediate di&s;traction but his &s;um|moning up re&s;olution enough to vouch for the truth of every thing that I &s;hould find it expedient to &s;ay to her, to prevent her obtaining any &s;udden

certainty of the horrible event. The hone&s;t fellow &s;eemed to gain new life from this idea, and was very firm in his promi&s;es and his inten|tions. He conjured me to let him ri&s;e and at|tend me immediately to the cottage, le&s;t in his return to Warwick&s;hire he &s;hould be too late to attend the funeral of his ma&s;ter, who&s;e poor mangled frame was to be depo&s;ited, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, in the church where many of his gallant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> repo&s;e, and which &s;tands within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Sir Richard's Park.

She ut|tered this re&s;olution with &s;uch an air of fondne&s;s and magnanimity, that it overthrew all the promi&s;ed fortitude of Robert, and the poor fel|low bur&s;t into tears. "O Chri&s;t!" exclaimed the quick Giuliana, fixing her keen eyes upon him, "my Peverell is dead! yes, I &s;ee clearly he is dead, by that hone&s;t fellow's di&s;tre&s;s." I tried to remove her from Robert, and &s;till to conceal from her the truth; but pu&s;hing me gently from her with a maje&s;ty of affliction that I could not re&s;i&s;t, the &s;aid, with the mo&s;t heart-piercing tone that I ever heard, "Robert, you never told me a fal&s;ehood in your life: I charge you, do not deceive me in a point &s;o near my &s;oul as the health of your dear ma&s;ter; an&s;wer me! &mdash;O GOD! you need not! &mdash;I &s;ee that he is dead!"&mdash;The &s;olemnity of this appeal utter|ly overwhelmed the poor &s;ervant.

<P><PB N="52" REF="54">I intended, my dear Seymour, to give you a mo&s;t minute detail of all the conver&s;ation that has pa&s;&s;ed between me and this mo&s;t intere&s;ting mourner; but two things, I find, will oblige me to contract the limits of this hi&s;tory: Fir&s;t, I am pre&s;&s;ed for time, as I wi&s;h to bring you &s;peedily to my aid; and &s;econdly, the &s;cenes I have already gone through for this unfortunate lovely creature have left &s;o &s;trong and recent an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I find I cannot relate them to you very minutely without &s;uffering in the relation much more than you would wi&s;h me to &s;uffer. I will only &s;ay, therefore, that I never be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eld affliction which appeared to me &s;o much the affliction of the heart as poor Giu|liana's. In&s;tead of bur&s;ting into tho&s;e vehe|ment expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;tre&s;s which I expected from the natural vivacity of her character, her grief has been calm and concentrated in her bo|&s;om; &s;he &s;heds no tears, and &s;peaks as if there was hardly life enough in the organs of her voice to permit her to articulate. She made but one reque&s;t to me &mdash;it was a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing one, yet made in &s;uch a manner that I would willingly have encountered any difficulties in the world rather than have barbarou&s;ly thwarted this fond and natural de&s;ire of her heart and &s;oul. You will probably gue&s;s that her de&s;ire was to fold once more in her arms the dear breathle&s;s idol of her affection; and you will think me little le&s;s romantic than your&s;elf, when I inform you that I have really taken a long journey, and ac|tual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tolen at midnight into the re&s;idence of the dead, to gratify this angelic mourner.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">Woe to the marble-hearted philo&s;ophers, who in&s;ult real &s;orrow by their pretended con&s;olation, which the bo&s;om of the afflicted is ju&s;t as able to receive, as the lips of the dead are to open for a cordial! The only way, I believe, to tri|umph over true grief of heart is, to indulge it in all the vehemence of its fond de&s;ire; it was by this method that I have gained an influence over the feeling &s;pirit of the afflicted Giuliana, which I could not otherwi&s;e have acquired. But you will want to know &s;ome particulars of our &s;ecret admi&s;&s;ion to the tomb. I contrived it thus: I let the faithful Robert return with all the expe|dition he wi&s;hed, and &s;upplied him with money to purcha&s;e for me the private a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;exton. This man happened to be my old ac|quaintance, as he had often attended me and my poor departed friend, in our &s;hooting parties, when Sir Richard was abroad, and his young nephew had the command of his domains. The hone&s;t fellow lives in a cottage, ju&s;t without the park pale, by the &s;ide of the high road, and picks up &s;ome &s;hillings in a year by &s;hewing his church, in which there are a few curious old monuments. Being very de&s;irous to keep our expedition as &s;ecret as po&s;&s;ible, we managed &s;o as to reach the cottage of the &s;exton between eleven and twelve at night. The faithful Ro|bert had not only met us at the Inn we appointed, but, to &s;hew his uncommon &s;olicitude for his afflicted mi&s;tre&s;s, had contrived, by his intima|cy with the innkeeper, to act him&s;elf as our po&s;|til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on. This unexpected and touching proof of delicate attention paid to her &s;orrow by this

feeling dome&s;tic, drew from Giuliana the only tear that I ob&s;erved her to &s;hed in our journey. As we found the &s;ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n perfectly prepared to at|tend us, we pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed on foot to cro&s;s the park-&s;tyle, and walked by a triple row of old and venerable trees that lead to the church. The night was particularly clear, and the moon in her fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ter; never in my life had I taken a nightly, walk &s;o affecting. Giuliana leant on my arm; but a &s;acred horror &s;eemed to have &s;ealed up the lips of both, and we glided into the church as &s;ilent as two gho&s;ts returning to their graves: I had &s;tored my pocket with drops and cordials, le&s;t any weakne&s;s or panic &s;hould oppre&s;s the nerves of my dejected and almo&s;t lifele&s;s companion; but, to my &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he di&s;covered nothing of that chill terror which the time and the &s;cene were &s;o likely to in&s;pire; on the contrary, animation &s;eemed to rekindle in her frame, in proportion as &s;he drew nigh to the dear &s;ource of her &s;orrow. I confe&s;s my own heart was chilled within me, when the &s;exton, who now preceded us with a gla&s;s lantern, with which the careful Robert had &s;upplied him, opened the ma&s;&s;ive and hollow-&s;ounding door of an exten&s;ive vault, that holds two regularly mar|&s;halled ranks of the dead, in mouldering mag|nificence; in this vault there are two iron g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, for a circulation of air, and it happened, as we entered, that the beams of the moon were ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed through one of the&s;e on a fre&s;h coffin of &s;ky-coloured velvet and &s;ilver ornaments.

<PB N="55" REF="57">
&s;he &s;oon found that the lid had been left unfa&s;ten|ed for her gratification, and having &s;eized the right hand of my poor departed friend &s;he clapt it wildly on her own heart. A gha&s;tly &s;mile of mingled agony and delight was now vi&s;ible in her pale face: I began to fear from her looks and ge&s;ture that her brain was turned by the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the &s;cene; and I repented my indul|gence, e&s;pecially when &s;he reque&s;ted, with the air of &s;ettled madne&s;s, permi&s;&s;ion to live in that vault, promi&s;ing not to de&s;troy her own life, but to receive a daily &s;upply of bread and water from the poor &s;exton. I never endured a moment to di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: I was obliged to &s;peak to her in a tone of authority, and indeed of reproach, very foreign to my heart. "Have you forgot, &s;aid I, that Peverell was my friend as well as yours, and that his &s;pirit now enjoins me to guide and protect you? is it not ungrateful to us both, to reward me thus for indulging the reque&s;t of your affliction?" She fell on her knees at this rebuke, and ki&s;&s;ed my hand; then joining it to the cold hand of her dead lover, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed them both together, and thus took a mo&s;t affecting oath of implicit obedience to me. I ha&s;tened to u&s;e the power I had gained by leading her out of the vault, but was &s;oon di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a new petition to return to it, for the &s;ake of taking a look of hair from the cor&s;e; but I in&s;i&s;ted on giving this commi&s;&s;ion to the faithful Robert, who had attended us. I hurried my tender charge, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, into the open air. I mu&s;t re&s;erve all the particulars of our return till I have the comfort of &s;eeing you, which I

Let me add, however, that I am now very far from repenting of this mournful expedition: I take, indeed, an hone&s;t pride in the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t I have acted; as I am con|vinced that nothing could have &s;o well prepared my di&s;con&s;olate companion for regulating her fu|ture conduct as I wi&s;h her to do; &s;he has &s;till in her countenance and manners the deep traces of inten&s;e affliction; but I can perceive that her grief is gradually melting into a tender and di|vine melancholy: as long as Peverell lived, I kept his &s;ecret &s;o faithfully, that Giuliana was unknown even to my &s;i&s;ter Lucy, who was under my roof at the time of the fair &s;tranger's arrival at her cottage.

<P>PRAY quit the apprehen&s;ions which you good &s;ouls have conceived, concerning the morals and the di&s;cretion of our dear brother Edmund&punc; Believe me, the fine &s;tory of his being entangled with an Italian mi&s;tre&s;s is a fiction of that artful toad-eater in petticoats who related it &s;o circum|&s;tantially, and who is, you know, in my opi|nion, the great nui&s;ance of your neighbourhood. Like mo&s;t of her mi&s;chievous &s;tories, it cuts like a &s;word with a double edge, from being a mix|ture of fal&s;hood and of truth. Yes, you may look as grave as you plea&s;e upon it, but it is even &s;o: we have had an Italian lady concealed in our cottage; but let me add, that if one of our family had been tempted to &s;leep with her, it would have been your humble &s;ervant Lucy, and not the innocent Edmund: not but my &s;age and &s;y&s;tematic batchelor, as he &s;tyles him&s;elf, is &s;ome|times a traitor to his own Platonic philo&s;ophy; yet, as he comes to me, like a culprit to his con|fe&s;&s;or, for &s;piritual admonition, I have hopes of working a very complete reform in his conduct, though none of &s;eeing him a married man. To confe&s;s my own &s;elf-intere&s;ted nature very frank|ly, as we live on &s;uch plea&s;ant terms together, and as I think the chance a thou&s;and to one
<PB N="59" REF="61">
again&s;t his being &s;o fortunate in marriage as a certain married brother of mine of your lady|&s;hip's acquaintance, I have no very earne&s;t de&s;ire that Edmund &s;hould cea&s;e to be a batchelor; yet, if he were really enamoured of this fair Italian, who has frightened you and your good man &s;o dreadfully, as I am ab&s;olutely in love with her my&s;elf, and have not alas the power of meta|morpho&s;ing my&s;elf into a hu&s;band, I &s;hould mo&s;t vehemently wi&s;h for Edmund's &s;ucce&s;s. After this hone&s;t declaration, if you are not dying with an encrea&s;ed curio&s;ity to know all that I can tell you concerning this bewitching "&s;he of Italy," to borrow a phra&s;e from Shak&s;peare, you mu&s;t certainly be &s;omething more than mortal</P>
<P>And now am I ready to quarrel with my fooli&s;h &s;elf for having talked with &s;uch an air of flip|pant, unfeeling levity, of a mo&s;t admirable crea|ture, in the utmo&s;t grief and angui&s;h, perhaps, that a human bo&s;om can experience; but the truth is, your alarm concerning the philo&s;ophical Edmund's being &s;uddenly ruined by a foreign courtezan hit my fancy &s;o ludicrou&s;ly, that I could not help &s;miling, though with a heart full of &s;orrow, for our lovely Giuliana. How to tell you who our lovely Giuliana is I hardly know, except by repeating, that &s;he is the mo&s;t afflicted and the mo&s;t intere&s;ting creature I ever met with; but, as &s;o brief a de&s;cription will not, I am &s;ure, content you, I mu&s;t add, that &s;he is the daughter of a rich merchant in Italy, and was tempted, by the mo&s;t dangerous and in&s;inuating of all modern tempters, Love, to vi&s;it England, with that wonderfully hand&s;ome and unfortunate
<PB N="60" REF="62">
young friend of Edmund's, who&s;e calamitous death you mention &s;o feelingly. Poor Peverell had deceived him&s;elf with the hope of being able to make his &s;tately proud uncle receive, and even love Giuliana as his niece. The horrid accident we are all lamenting hurried him out of life, not only before he had made any &s;ucce&s;sful advances in this chimerical project, but before he had taken care, as he certainly ought to have done, to provide for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of this lovely &s;tran|ger, in ca&s;e of &s;uch a calamity as it has plea&s;ed Heaven to inflict; yet, full as he was of all the &s;anguine hopes that generous love can in&s;pire, added to the natural high &s;pirits of youth in per|fect health, we cannot wonder that he forgot to reflect on his mortality. The con&s;equence, how|ever, of &s;uch forgetfulne&s;s might have been cruel indeed to the de&s;olate object of his affection, if it had not plea&s;ed Heaven to rai&s;e a guardian, I might &s;ay a new and better father to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Giuliana, in our kind-hearted Edmund. The lovely romantic girl, who perfectly under&s;tood her lover's ab&s;olute dependence on his uncle, had repeatedly declined a private marriage, from a very generous re&s;olut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, of not becoming the wife of the man &s;he adored while there was a chance that &s;uch a &s;tep might involve him in rain. She had, indeed, two events to expect: Sir Richard is neither young nor healthy; his con&s;ent, or his death, might have &s;ettled our beautiful &s;tranger in the &s;tation &s;he de&s;erved to fill. There appeared a fair chance, that one or other might &s;oon improve her &s;ituation; and, as &s;he had an entire reliance on the truth and gene|ro&s;ity
<PB N="61" REF="63">
of her lover, &s;he was contented to abide this chance, in what mo&s;t women would have thought a wretched and humiliating ob&s;curity, though under the protection of Edmund.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do my brother the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, he kept the &s;ecret of the&s;e unfortunate lovers with &s;o much fidelity and addre&s;s, that I knew nothing of Giuliana, though &s;he had re&s;ided many weeks in a neighbouring cottage, till the &s;ea&s;on of her di&s;tre&s;s. Edmund, who has indeed behaved to her like a father, then made us known to each other, in the hope, which I have not, I tru&s;t, utterly di&s;appointed, that I might a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the very difficult ta&s;k of healing, or rather &s;ooth|ing, the wounded &s;pirit of this lovely mourner. As you are now acquainted with the &s;ingularity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her &s;ituation, you may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, conceive the inten&s;e grief occa&s;ioned by a lo&s;s &s;o unexpected, which rendered her the mo&s;t de&s;olate of beings.</P>
<P>When &s;he ventured to quit the hou&s;e of her father, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uling pa&s;&s;ion is money, &s;he made it a point of honour to leave him her jewels, and to take from him nothing of value, except indeed her&s;elf&mdash;a trea&s;ure that he &s;eems never to have e&s;timated as he ought. As to her departed lover, his heart was much richer than his pur&s;e: his allowance from the &s;paring Sir Richard never equalled his expences; and his love being of too noble a kind to &s;hew it&s;elf in co&s;tly trifles, he had made his mi&s;tre&s;s no &s;uch pre&s;ents as might on a &s;udden exigence be converted into gold. Thus, it my brother had not &s;tood like a good angel by her &s;ide, the young, the beautiful, the
<PB N="62" REF="64">
cha&s;te, and lately opulent Giuliana, might have been reduced, with her little Abigail, a &s;weet orphan girl of twelve years, either to beg her way home to an enraged father, or to &s;eek &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence among &s;trangers by &s;ome humiliating oc|cupation. The bare idea of &s;uch a lovely crea|ture falling &s;uddenly into &s;uch penury and wretchedne&s;s makes my heart &s;hudder whenever it recurs to my mind; but our tender Giuliana never felt her misfortune in this hideous point of view; &s;he felt only the lo&s;s of him by the light of who&s;e countenance alone &s;he appeared to exi&s;t; and &s;he felt it &s;o inten&s;ely, that Edmund a&s;&s;ures me it was the pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of her &s;oul to be &s;hut up from the world, and end her exi&s;t|ence in the vault that holds the &s;hattered frame of her ill-fated lover. I will tell you, one day or other, all that our dear Edmund has done to in|dulge the wildne&s;s of her affliction; at pre&s;ent I mu&s;t only &s;ay, that no Don Quixote ever exerted more generous &s;pirit to re&s;tore a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fair-one to her living Lord, than our brother has done to gratify the inten&s;e grief of this true and engaging mourner for the gallant youth &s;he has lo&s;t. His &s;ucce&s;s has been equal to his good in|tention. I never &s;aw gratitude expre&s;&s;ed by any human being in a manner &s;o touching as Giuli|ana's in expre&s;&s;ing hers to us both. It is not by &s;aying &s;he is obliged to us, but by &s;hewing, in a thou&s;and unde&s;cribable ways, that her gratitude i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by no means inferior to her exce&s;&s;ive affliction; by letting us &s;ee that &s;he makes her poor broken and bleeding heart &s;ubmit it&s;elf entirely to the guidance of my brother; and that he has gained
<PB N="63" REF="65">
an influence like that of Heaven over her actions and even her will. I have really had a great, though melancholy delight in contemplating the very &s;ingular regard which compa&s;&s;ion on his part, and &s;orrow and gratitude on hers, have produced between them. I never behold any human attachment more affecting; and Edmund, you know, has imparted to me his habit of mo|ralizing on our pa&s;&s;ions and affections. My con|templations, I confe&s;s, are very apt to be infected with feminine weakne&s;s; and to tell you an hone&s;t truth, I could not behold the influence of Edmund and Giuliana on each other without finding an idea of their union perpetually ob|truding it&s;elf on my reluctant mind; yet, as I own the idea was very in&s;uitable to the time and circum&s;tances, I never mentioned it to either, and I will pawn my life that it never occurred either to the one or the other. Edmund is &s;o very anxious to have this tender unhappy fugitive &s;afely re&s;tored and reconciled to her father, that we had thoughts of taking a trip to Italy, for the &s;atisfaction of e&s;corting her home. How charm|ing would this have been, to have united huma|nity and plea&s;ure &s;o delightfully! But, alas! the provoking legal bu&s;ine&s;s, which we now find in &s;uch a train as to require our pre&s;ence in Eng|land for &s;ome months, is an in&s;uperable bar to this captivating project. Edmund, however, has been &s;o fortunate as to find a charitable proxy, to his heart's content. Giuliana and her little attendant are &s;et forth this morning on their re|turn to Italy, under the guidance and protection of his friend Seymour, who, after pa&s;&s;ing a few
<PB N="64" REF="66">
days here, has undertaken, in the mo&s;t delicate and generous manner, not only to convey the two forlorn foreigners to their own country, but to accompli&s;h a reconcilement between Giuliana and her father, exactly in the way that my bro|ther had devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>So you really think that your &s;weet friend Cornelia has conceived, without knowing it, a real pa&s;&s;ion for Seymour. I am not at all &s;ur|prized at it; e&s;pecially after the diverting anec|dotes you tell me of the fondne&s;s which her chil|dren have conceived for this engaging mortal. I own, if I were a widow my&s;elf, nothing would win me &s;o &s;oon as the perceiving a man beloved by my children, and of cour&s;e very fond of them. I believe Seymour is perfectly &s;incere in his pre|&s;ent extreme pa&s;&s;ion for the widow; but were I in her ca&s;e, I &s;hould tremble for the i&s;&s;ue of the expedition in which he has &s;o gallantly embarked. To travel &s;o far, by land and by &s;ea, with a mo&s;t beautiful creature, in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of all po&s;&s;ible &s;ituations! &mdash;Well, I will only &s;ay, if he continues &s;teady in his attachment to your Cor|nelia, he is a Phoenix of a lover, and de&s;erves to be cheri&s;hed accordingly.</P>
<P>As our dear Edmund is apt, you know, to be very profound in his projects of benevolence, he has a double view in committing Giuliana to the care of his friend. But, to explain this, I mu&s;t tell you a circum&s;tance in which your good hu&s;|band will triumph not a little, as it affords a &s;triking confirmation of his favourite maxims, concerning the u&s;e and efficacy of devotion in every period of life. Pray de&s;ire him, therefore,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
to take notice, that this piece of information is addre&s;&s;ed particularly to him&s;elf; and he, I am &s;ure, will not &s;uppo&s;e me mi&s;taken, when I tell him, that although Edmund's very tender and parental attention to the de&s;olate Giuliana had great influence in &s;oothing her &s;orrow, yet, in truth, it is religion alone that has enabled her wounded &s;pirit to &s;urmount the calamity which appeared to cru&s;h it. From all the particulars of her &s;tory, I am convinced that &s;he felt for the unhappy Peverell as pure and as &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion as the female bo&s;om is capable of feeling. The devotional turn of her mind has converted her love into literal und &s;urely happy and pardonable adoration. She con&s;iders this dear object, not as hurried out of life to leave her without a guardian, in the thorny and dangerous paths of the world, but as tran&s;ported to Heaven, to &s;ecure for her, and to &s;hare with her, everla&s;ting felicity. She thinks her&s;elf not only awakened and directed by this angelic guide to &s;ave her own &s;oul, but to attempt and accompli&s;h the &s;alvation of her father. She is per&s;uaded, and perhaps with &s;ome truth, that both have been deficient in their re|&s;pective duties, from being equally blinded by two different deceivers, Intere&s;t and Love. Your hu&s;band would be marvellou&s;ly delighted by her pathetic eloquence on this devout &s;ubject. In|deed, I hardly think it po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t har|dened Infidel to hear her without tears, and without paying the lovely preacher at lea&s;t &s;uch a compliment as Agrippa paid to Paul. It is on the &s;weet magic of this heavenly &s;orrow that our good Edmund h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s built &s;ome very friendly hopes
<PB N="66" REF="68">
in behalf of Seymour. He is willing to be|lieve that a long attendance on this engaging mourner, this divine enthu&s;ia&s;t, may cure that too light though agreeable and generous young man, of the alarming irreligious levity, which is the only blemi&s;h in his attractive character. For my own par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I mu&s;t &s;ay, though I think the ob|&s;ervation does not become a &s;pin&s;ter, I fear there is more benevolence than probability in Ed|mund's idea. I am afraid the expedition may rather lead this too lively creature into a profane pa&s;&s;ion for the beauty before him, than into a religious attachment to an ab&s;ent fair. I mu&s;t however do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that he &s;hews the mo&s;t delicate re&s;pect to the grief of Giuliana. But his e&s;teem for her devotion I can gue&s;s, by one of his &s;prightly remarks to me concerning her pre&s;ent views. The rogue &s;aid, he did not apprehend that any piety was &s;trong enough to cure a young woman of Love, or an old man of Avarice. I &s;hould add, however, that after op|po&s;ing Giuliana's return to the old mi&s;er, to u&s;e his own words, he became an ab&s;olute convert to the rea&s;oning of my brother, and appeared to &s;ympathi&s;e with him mo&s;t cordially in his wi&s;h of reconciling the dear lovely devout girl, and her outrageous father.</P>
<P>I am charged, by Seymour, to &s;olicit both you and your Cornelia to honour him with &s;ome commi&s;&s;ions abroad; and I have promi&s;ed to convey to him your re&s;pective commands. As your friend has &s;o &s;weet a voice, I think you can|not do better than de&s;ire a complete collection of all the airs &s;ung by our dear Giuliana. My bro|ther
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;ays, &s;he has an infinite variety of &s;ongs, unknown in our country, and wonderfully &s;weet. Be&s;ides their intrin&s;ic merit as mu&s;ical compo&s;i|tions, they will have an additional charm to all of us, in recalling the lovely image of Giuliana to our minds. The attractions of her character are &s;uch, that even you and Cornelia, who have never beheld her beauty, will yet have a plea&s;ure in thinking of her, when Edmund and I have had &s;ufficient opportunities to tell you a thou&s;and little intere&s;ting anecdotes relating to her &s;hort re&s;idence in our country.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I mu&s;t add but a few lines to this enormous pacquet, for which I &s;hall hope to be as amply repaid, by a full hi&s;tory of all the new di&s;coveries that you may have made in the heart of Cornelia. Pray &s;end, if you dare, a few ani|mating words for me to di&s;patch to the generous guardian of Giuliana on his travels. There is &s;ome virtue in this petition, for it may keep him con&s;tant to his pre&s;ent cha&s;te pa&s;&s;ion, to give him &s;ome pro&s;pect of future &s;ucce&s;s. I am ready to laugh at my&s;elf, in perceiving what a lively inte|re&s;t I, who have renounced love on my own ac|count, am &s;till ready to take in the loves of my acquaintance. I am, I think, like an unlucky game&s;ter, who, having narrowly e&s;caped the ut|ter wreck of his fortune, and having &s;olemnly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> never to touch a card again, yet loiters round the tables, and has an odd plea&s;ure in peep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng into every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and that he can catch a &s;ight of.

You, my dear Har|riot,

are like a lucky mortal at commerce, who has triumphantly cried, "Content;" perfectly &s;ecure that no one can exhibit a richer hand.

<P>YOU are a charming good creature, my dear Lucy, to relieve us &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o effec|tually, from our apprehen&s;ions. You have made us laugh at our own moral panic, as I may call it, concerning the continence of Edmund. You have made us weep at the very bitter affliction of your intere&s;ting Giuliana; and you have made us laugh again by the plea&s;antry of your &s;age re|flections

upon &s;ingle ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. You may talk as you plea&s;e of your wi&s;e intentions; but I hope de&s;tiny has more benevolence to man, than to have devoted &s;uch a delightful creature as my dear corre&s;pondent to a life of celibacy. You have, indeed, had a narrow e&s;cape, after much agitation of the heart, from matrimonial mi&s;ery, with a partner who &s;hewed him&s;elf in a fortunate, though painful moment, unworthy of the ble&s;&s;|ing that in the blindne&s;s of our deluded affection we all wi&s;hed him to po&s;&s;e&s;s. You felt, and you &s;upported, the di&s;appointment in a manner that has rendered you inexpre&s;&s;ibly dear to all who have the happine&s;s of your friend&s;hip; and I tru&s;t it will be your lot to receive a richer reward in the love of &s;ome happier man, as perfectly de|&s;erving of you as the wretch I allude to was un|worthy. Deuce take the artful fellow! I hate to think of him; yet the remembrance of all his ba&s;e deceptions will often creep over my mind, like a chilling mi&s;t with a damp ea&s;terly wind. There is certainly much more true heroi&s;m in your &s;oul, my dear Lucy, than in mine; though my good man often pays me compliments on my fortitude, I could not have pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch &s;cenes as you have had to &s;u&s;tain, with half your &s;pirit, or half your good &s;en&s;e. I rejoice to find that you &s;till retain the natural tender gaiety of your heart, and form to your&s;elf an agreeable amu&s;ement in contemplating the affections of your acquaintance.</P>
<P>I am mo&s;t willing to impart to you the intelli|gence you reque&s;t; yes, yes, I have made di&s;co|veries in the bo&s;om of our Cornelia. Do not the

philo&s;ophers talk of little &s;pots in the moon that they affirm to be burning volcanos! I can per|ceive, without the aid of any marvellous gla&s;&s;es from that mo&s;t obliging and polite man of deep &s;cience Mr. Her&s;chell, a &s;pot of this flaming na|ture in that cha&s;te luminary the heart of our lovely widow. Heavens! what a crim&s;on cheek would &s;he have, were &s;he to peep over my &s;houl|der, and peru&s;e this &s;aucy &s;entence! But 'tis even &s;o; love is like murder, not to be conceal|ed, however ob&s;tinately it may be denied. The dear dainty hypocrite is angry with me, when I tell her &s;o; yet I could give you a thou&s;and little unque&s;tionable evidences in &s;upport of my charge; but I have only time to tell you one, that &s;truck me ye&s;terday: a gentleman happened to dine with us, who has pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of his life abroad. Cornelia engaged him in a conver&s;ation apart, and I accidentally di&s;covered that Genoa had been a capital &s;ubject in their di&s;cour&s;e: &s;he had enquired if Engli&s;h travellers had ever been tempted to marry there by the fair natives of that opulent city: when I, je&s;tingly, alluded to this enquiry, which &s;he did not &s;up|po&s;e me to know, &s;he blu&s;hed in &s;uch a violent degree, that as we were alone I could not help &s;eizing her hand, and exclaiming, in a very odd &s;ort of emotion, between a laugh and a cry, "Well, my dear, you &s;hall have him, let him be Jew or Gentile." This led us into much &s;e|rious conver&s;ation, in which, with more frank|ne&s;s than &s;he had ever &s;hewn upon this &s;ubject before, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &mdash;Here, Lucy, I &s;ee you &s;mile, in full and roguei&s;h expectation of peru&s;|ing

the word Love; that, indeed, would have been a confe&s;&s;ion worth li&s;tening to; but not &s;o fa&s;t, my dear girl, we are not yet arrived at that &s;tage of the di&s;order; no, we confe&s;&s;ed only, that of all the &s;ingle men in the world this lively and generous traveller, Mr. Seymour, is the mo&s;t agreeable in figure, in manners, in conver|&s;ation; but as to love, no: po&s;itively, &s;eriou&s;ly, and by all the unque&s;tionable a&s;&s;everations that ever pa&s;&s;ed the cha&s;te lips of widowhood, we have not the &s;lighte&s;t &s;park of that fiery pa&s;&s;ion in our frame: Mr. Seymour may pa&s;s his whole life in Italy, and we &s;hould feel no farther &s;olici|tude concerning him, than what every amiable mind mu&s;t feel for the welfare of an accompli&s;h|ed young man, who engaged &s;o readily in a rare and noble act of humanity. And &s;o, my dear Lucy, &s;o "we deceive our&s;elves, and the truth is not in us." She means all that &s;he &s;ays, for her hone&s;t lips have not the power of uttering even an equivocation, if her mind was capable of con&s;piring with her heart to meditate di&s;gui&s;e.

<HEAD>LETTER X. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>HERE we are, &s;afe at Dover; and after writing the inclo&s;ed extempore tran&s;lation of what the grateful Giuliana dictated to me in her own language, I have hardly time to add a word more, as they are hurrying us on board the packet, le&s;t we lo&s;e our pa&s;&s;age.

genuine tenderne&s;s as Peverell receives from this angelic mourner! How non&s;en&s;ical, how frantic, would this idea appear, to beings who never were in love, and have no feelings for the deli|cious extravagance of that &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ion! yet it reigns at this moment in full force over my heart and &s;oul.

<P>AFTER a &s;mooth, but rather a &s;low pa&s;|&s;age, we are at length in France! thank Heaven. You want not any de&s;cription of French people, or French buildings; if you
<PB N="77" REF="79">
did, I fear the accounts you would gain from me would be very un&s;atisfactory. I can &s;ee and hear nothing but my marvellou&s;ly intere&s;ting fellow-traveller. What a divine creature &s;he is! how admirable in her form and faculties! how ex|qui&s;ite in her &s;en&s;ations! what efforts of heart and &s;oul has it co&s;t her to tear her&s;elf from the land that holds her buried lover! I can never forget her looks and ge&s;ture as &s;he quitted our coa&s;t. The la&s;t thing &s;he did on &s;hore was to &s;toop and pick up a pebble, which &s;he ki&s;&s;ed de|voutly, and then pre&s;&s;ed into her bo&s;om: a mil|lion of words could not have expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much as &s;he did by this little ge&s;ture. I believe I &s;hould have thought it fanta&s;tic in another wo|man; but in Giuliana it appeared &s;imple, grace|ful and affecting, in the highe&s;t degree. What a rich fund of &s;ingular and entirely new de|lights have you afforded me, my dear Edmund, by this commi&s;&s;ion! Had a prophet told me, two years ago, that I &s;hould at this time be tra|velling with a young beauty, not connected with any living mortal; that I &s;hould hear, day after day, the &s;ofte&s;t language from the mo&s;t lovely lips; that I &s;hould have every opportunity for the mo&s;t tender familiarities, and yet that I &s;hould &s;it by the &s;ide of this fair creature with|out thinking that &s;he had &s;uch a thing as a lip belonging to her, without feeling a &s;ingle inti|mation from all the warm and wanton blood in my veins that I had a daughter of Eve within the reach of my embrace; had a prophet, I &s;ay, told me this, I &s;hould have laughed at him for a lying oracle, and have informed him, that his
<PB N="78" REF="80">
prediction was not very con&s;i&s;tent with general nature, and &s;till le&s;s &s;o with my con&s;titution: yet this is truly the ca&s;e. Giuliana &s;eems to have realized the idea, in a charming &s;ong of Par|nell's, to have been a woman to Peverell alone, and to be an angel to all the re&s;t of mankind. I may, in truth, apply to her the expre&s;&s;ion of her darling Petrarch, and &s;ay, that her eyes &s;eem to purify the air, and to bani&s;h every evil thought from her pre&s;ence. You know I have long been fond of the Italian language; and I thought my&s;elf an intelligent admirer of Pe|trarch, that in&s;ipid and weari&s;ome &s;onneteer in the e&s;timation of ordinary readers, that mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and enchanting of all poets to every refined &s;pirit under the immediate influence of &s;orrow or of love. But, though a tolerable pro|ficient in his language, I really never felt the magic of Petrarch till I heard him recited by Gi|uliana; and for this very high delight I am part|ly indebted to accident. In drawing out her pur&s;e, at Canterbury, to be&s;tow her charity on a venerable old mendicant, Giuliana let fall a mo&s;t elegant diminutive copy of this celebrated poet: this, as &s;he her&s;elf informed me, had been the con&s;tant pocket-companion of her dear Pe|verell: the book, as if in &s;ympathy with its ma&s;ter, had even received a wound from the horrid accident which occa&s;ioned his death; and his &s;ervant, the faithful Robert, thinking, very ju&s;tly, that his tender-hearted mi&s;tre&s;s would prize it as a &s;acred invaluable relique, had beg|ged, pre&s;erved, and pre&s;ented it to her. I was highly plea&s;ed with this little anecdote; and par|ticularly
<PB N="79" REF="81">
happy to catch a &s;ubject for conver&s;ation that I knew to be in harmony with the feelings of my afflicted companion. I made Petrarch, therefore, the main topic of our di&s;cour&s;e; I feigned my&s;elf puzzled by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, for the plea&s;ure of leading Giuliana to amu&s;e her&s;elf by a kind explanation of them. Heavens! if the &s;oul of the poet was con&s;cious of our con|ference concerning him, what delight mu&s;t he have received from the eloquent prai&s;e of his lovely commentator! When &s;he found I had &s;ome reli&s;h for her darling author, &s;he began to indulge her&s;elf in various quotations, &s;o patheti|cally appo&s;ite to her own condition, and deliver|ed with &s;uch perfect eloquence, that I &s;eemed never to have been acquainted either with true poetry, or true elocution, till that moment. I &s;hould fill a volume were I to enumerate and give you a full account of all the&s;e. Indeed you have a little &s;pecimen; but, without her voice, and with my tran&s;lation, a mo&s;t imperfect &s;peci|men of them, in <HI>her letter</HI> from Dover. I mu&s;t however tell you one of her quotations, which &s;truck me mo&s;t forcibly; but let me fir&s;t men|tion the occa&s;ion that produced it. You know I join with you in dete&s;ting that cruel and ab|&s;urd maxim of endeavouring to con&s;ole extreme &s;orrow by leading it from its object; grief is a noble imperious pa&s;&s;ion, that ought not to be thwarted, but to be flattered and indulged: on the&s;e principles, in&s;tead of avoiding the name of Peverell, I have frequently introduced it; and as we were within a few miles of Dover, in &s;peaking of the per&s;onal attractions of Laura,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
I extolled in the warme&s;t terms that rare portion of ma&s;culine grace and comeline&s;s which that gallant young man was univer&s;ally allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s. I thought I &s;aw in the features of Gi|uliana that her impa&s;&s;ioned heart &s;welled with a delightful, though melancholy pride, in hearing this hone&s;t prai&s;e of its idol; and in a moment &s;he exclaimed,
<Q LANG="ita"><L>Di&s;colorato hai morte il piu vel volto</L>
<L>Che mai &s;i vide; e i piu begli occhi &s;penti</L>
<L>Spirto piu' acce&s;o di virtuti ardenti</L>
<L>Del piu leggiadro, e piu vel nodo hai &s;ciolto.</L>
<L>In un momento ogni mio ven mihai tolto.</L></Q></P>
<Q LANG="eng">[Oh Death, thou ha&s;t di&s;coloured the mo&s;t beautiful countenance, and extingui&s;hed the brighte&s;t eyes! thou ha&s;t loo&s;ed from the mo&s;t graceful of mortal bonds a &s;pirit mo&s;t animated by every ardent virtue. In a moment thou ha&s;t robbed me of all my trea&s;ure.]</Q>
<P>Would to heaven I were a poet, that I might give you a ju&s;ter idea of the&s;e enchanting num|bers! yet, even then, I could not convey to you the inimitable ge&s;ture and heart-&s;earching tone of Giuliana; the&s;e were &s;o exqui&s;itely pathetic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n this occa&s;ion, that I was never half &s;o much affected by the deepe&s;t tragedy as by her recita|tion of the&s;e few ver&s;es. My tears, I believe, would have continued flowing till we entered Dover, had not my affection been called to a little auditor who felt the pathos of this pa&s;&s;age &s;till more inten&s;ely than I did: you will imme|diately &s;ee this could be no other than the poor
<PB N="81" REF="83">
faithful Giannina, whom you &s;eated on the &s;tool at our feet. I &s;oon perceived her little ro&s;y face was grown as pale as death it&s;elf; and I verily believe the girl would have fainted, or fallen in|to convul&s;ions, if I had not jumped from the chai&s;e, and carried her in my arms for a few paces in the cool air. Giuliana, who is, you know, all tenderne&s;s to this little orphan, &s;oon completed her recovery, by the &s;weetne&s;s of her maternal &s;olicitude for the affectionate &s;ufferer. But let me return to Petrarch: As we are &s;uch idolaters of the poet, we have agreed to vi&s;it Vauclu&s;e on our journey, and I &s;hall not write to you again till we have paid our devotions there. I conjure you and Lucy to &s;it down and begin learning Italian together; you know not what delight you have lo&s;t, by not being able to conver&s;e with our lovely friend in her own &s;weet languge. Thank Heaven, my Cornelia both &s;peaks and &s;ings it. My Cornelia, do I &s;ay? alas! if &s;he is de&s;tined not to be &s;o! Do you know, that Giuliana, who has, I fancy, received &s;ome hints from Lucy, begins to preach to me, like an angel as &s;he is, on my impetuous character, and the danger of the pa&s;&s;ions! I am impetuous, I confe&s;s, yet not unrea&s;onable in my wi&s;hes. Oh Heaven! let me be but as ar|dently beloved by Cornelia as Peverell &s;till is by Giuliana, and I will a&s;k no more! Adieu. My engaging fellow-traveller intreated me to &s;ay every thing that is kind for her. While I have been writing, &s;he and Giannina have been try|ing to &s;leep off the unplea&s;ant effects of their
<PB N="82" REF="84">
&s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. They are now much re&s;tored. Once more adieu; and let me repeat my reque&s;t, and con&s;ign you to your Italian Grammar, that you may read the future letters of Giuliana with full plea&s;ure. She will write to you, &s;he &s;ays, as long as &s;he exi&s;ts; and if you do not acquire her language, you may oblige her perhaps, hereafter, to have her thoughts and words man|gled by &s;ome tran&s;lator &s;till wor&s;e than your af|fectionate, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AS I knew I &s;hould find opportunities of &s;end|ing our kind remembrances to you by your intimate friend, and mo&s;t punctual corre&s;pon|dent, at Paris, I intended not to write to you again till we had reached Avignon, and vi&s;ited Vauclu&s;e, the only object in our road that I thought likely to intere&s;t the curio&s;ity, and af|ford any thing like amu&s;ement, to my love|ly grief devoted companion. But we have un|expectly met with &s;ome adventures in our way, that not only drove Petrarch and Vauclu&s;e from her mind, but almo&s;t made her forget even Peve|rell
<PB N="83" REF="85">
him&s;elf. In a word, my dear Edmund (but do not be alarmed, for the danger is all over), I have been at the point of death. I had rea&s;on indeed to call Giuliana an angel; for I mu&s;t have expired, had not this divine creature watched over me with an attention as indefati|gable and ince&s;&s;ant as ever was paid by a fond mother to her &s;ick infant. We have now been eleven days in this commodious and charitable city: I ought, I am &s;ure, to be&s;tow upon it that honourable epithet, as I have received from its generous inhabitants, to whom even my name was unknown, various pre&s;ents of &s;uch articles as they &s;uppo&s;ed might be of u&s;e and comfort to a &s;tranger, whom &s;ickne&s;s had overtaken on his travels. My di&s;order, I confe&s;s, has been the natural effect of my own imprudence; for at Moulines I did a very fooli&s;h thing: unknown to Giuliana, and tru&s;ting too much to a &s;trong con&s;titution, I contracted a villainous cold and fe|ver, by pa&s;&s;ing the whole night in the open air, to gratify a non&s;en&s;ical whim that I will explain to you hereafter. By &s;lighting my complaint at fir&s;t, I made it mi&s;erably &s;erious. On my arri|val here, I was obliged to keep my bed; and dur|ing the fir&s;t &s;even days Giuliana and her good little &s;ilent &s;hadow Giannina were con&s;tantly in my chamber day and night. They have now (God ble&s;s them!) re&s;tored me to &s;uch a degree that we are to &s;et forward again to-morrow, and in a mode of travelling that, in&s;tead of wearying me with the fatigue of a journey, will rather re&s;tore me by the mo&s;t ea&s;y, plea&s;ant, and re|fre&s;hing exerci&s;e; for we are to de&s;cend the
<PB N="84" REF="86">
Rhone in a large batteau, in which there is a cabbin; it will take our carriage on board, and we are to &s;top in this agreeable voyage for the purpo&s;es of dining and &s;leeping at the different towns that embelli&s;h the banks of the river: thus, they tell us, we &s;hall be &s;moothly and gai|ly wafted to Avignon; and in truth, though my fever is entirely gone, I am not yet fit for any &s;ort of rapid or rough motion. Here is my be&s;t phy&s;ician, nur&s;e, and governe&s;s, Giuliana, looking at her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and grateful patient with her angelic black eyes, and commanding me to re&s;ign my pen; fir&s;t, becau&s;e my head is not very fit to guide it any longer; and &s;e|condly, becau&s;e &s;he is determined &s;he &s;ays to add her&s;elf an Engli&s;h po&s;t&s;cript to this epi&s;tle. She &s;hall not, however, take the paper from me till I have told you, that in&s;tead of lamenting, I really ble&s;s my illne&s;s; becau&s;e it has in its ter|mination done more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the wounded &s;pirit of my lovely friend, than my broken health could po&s;&s;ibly have rendered her. My recovery &s;eems indeed to have given her new exi&s;tence. O Benevolence! I was not before in&s;en&s;ible to thy beauty or thy power; but I knew not till now thy healing efficacy over a heart, however brui&s;ed and torn, that is &s;till able to feel thee in all thy pure&s;t exce&s;s! Giu|liana, in &s;aving, and &s;ecuring to me, that life which was on the point of its departure from this &s;uffering frame, has in great mea&s;ure di&s;pelled the oppre&s;&s;ive cloud which hung &s;o heavy on her cele&s;tial mind. Though it is a cordial to me to prai&s;e her to you as I ought, &s;he will not allow

<P>YOU are a &s;kilful chemi&s;t indeed, my dear Lucy&mdash;an ab&s;olute conjuror; but pray &s;end us no more of your corro&s;ive touch&s;tones, my dear; or when you do, be &s;o kind as to give me, at the &s;ame time, a le&s;&s;on of caution on the u&s;e of them.&mdash;Turn pale indeed! do you call this turning pale, to be half frightened out of &s;en&s;e and exi&s;tence? Ah, poor Cornelia! verily thou art infected. But let me recover from my &s;ympathy in her panic, and make a full confe&s;&s;ion to you, my dear full &s;i&s;ter, in this little piece of inqui&s;itorial iniquity, how very wickedly I managed it. Your pacquet travel|ling by a private hand, found me alone in the morning. Cornelia had left me, to write let|ters in her own room. Having peru&s;ed both yours and Seymour's, I was &s;eized with a pa&s;|&s;ionate de&s;ire to make the mo&s;t of your touch|&s;tone. I believe, my dear, all women have
<PB N="89" REF="91">
a little white malice in their minds on &s;uch occa&s;ions. I in&s;tantly &s;ealed the pacquet again very neatly, and told my own maid to bring it to me as ju&s;t arrived, when &s;he found that Cor|nelia and I were &s;at down as u&s;ual to work toge|ther in the favourite little dre&s;&s;ing-room. This critical time &s;oon arrived; and while we were di&s;cour&s;ing on the travellers, a very frequent to|pic with us, your kind pacquet was put again into my hand. Before I broke the &s;eal, I ob|&s;erved no &s;mall degree of &s;olicitude in the coun|tenance of my companion. I thought her eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure on the &s;ight of Seymour's hand. She entreated me to read his letter aloud. I obeyed your direction; and left out the pa|renthe&s;is that &s;peaks of his recovery: and in &s;lowly pronouncing the words <Q>at the point of death,</Q> I fixed a &s;earching eye on the features of my friend; de&s;cribe them to you I cannot&mdash; no language can do ju&s;tice to their expre&s;&s;ion; I mu&s;t therefore content my&s;elf with telling you my own varied &s;en&s;ations of the moment. When I caught the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of her face, as I had my own treacherous trick very &s;trongly in my head, I was on the point of laughing at the appearance of its &s;ucce&s;s; but the pallid hue of affectionate terror, and I may &s;ay agony, growing every in&s;tant more alarming in the countenance of Cornelia, who &s;at before me with the open but &s;peechle&s;s lips of anxiety and expectation, my heart &s;mote me, and rendered me unable to execute all the cruel de&s;ign that I had formed again&s;t her; which was, to let her remain for &s;ome hours in an ab&s;olute per&s;ua&s;ion
<PB N="90" REF="92">
of Seymour's being &s;till in great danger: this barbarity I could not &s;upport; I read the reviving parenthe&s;is; but without an avowal that I ought to have read it before. She was a little comfort|ed: but her &s;ufferings were &s;till &s;evere enough to excite my compa&s;&s;ion: &s;he perceived that I pitied her, and it both &s;oftened and opened her heart towards me; for, on my &s;aying, with an half-&s;mile, "Ah, my dear Cornelia, can you &s;till &s;ay, and think, that you do not love Seymour?" &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and hiding her lovely face in my bo&s;om, &s;he &s;aid, in a heart-piercing murmur, "I do, my deare&s;t friend, I do love him in my &s;oul: but it is a folly and a crime, my dear Harriot, that you mu&s;t not encourage, but help me to cure."</P>
<P>You, my dear Lucy, who know what a friend I am to all hone&s;t love, will readily gue&s;s the part I now took in our conver&s;ation. I &s;aid eve|ry thing that the mo&s;t friendly &s;ympathy could &s;ugge&s;t, to &s;oothe and to fortify her over-&s;crupu|lous and trembling heart. I &s;aid what I really think, that her affection, in&s;tead of being ei|ther fooli&s;h or criminal, is the fair offspring, not only of nature, but of propriety and ju&s;|tice. The very delicate and re&s;pectful manner in which Seymour had &s;ought her e&s;teem, dur|ing the life of the poor old querulous invalid, whom it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to love; the trembling awe, and the fond anxiety, with which he ventured to force him&s;elf into her pre&s;ence in this hou&s;e; and all his behaviour here; furni&s;hed me with weighty arguments in his favour; and I pleaded his cau&s;e, I believe,
<PB N="91" REF="93">
with all the warmth of a &s;i&s;ter; for I almo&s;t feel that I love him with a &s;i&s;terly affection my|&s;elf. The poor fellow &s;eemed to derive &s;o much comfort from my little civility to him in his &s;hort vi&s;it here, when my good man and Cornelia were both inclined to look rather blank upon him, that he convinced me of the truth and force of his pa&s;&s;ion, by the exce&s;s of his timidity and embarra&s;&s;ment; for in the fir&s;t hour or two be &s;eemed as it were to cling to me, to give him courage, as a child does, in fir&s;t entering a dark room with its nur&s;e. As the rogue does not want either grace or decent confidence in his ge|neral manners, his extreme &s;en&s;ibility on this occa&s;ion inclined me very much to befriend him. I did &s;o when he was here; I have now done &s;o in his ab&s;ence; and if it &s;hould really prove a misfortune to Cornelia to love him, as the dear weeping trembler told me it certainly mu&s;t, Hea|ven forgive me for the &s;in I have incurred in fanning the flame of her bo&s;om! Not that I think Seymour much indebted to the abilities or the zeal of his advocate, for the &s;way he has gained over this little &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, though mur|muring heart, we are talking of. I &s;aid indeed a good deal in his prai&s;e: but what of that? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad not the mo&s;t eloquent of all eulogi&s;ts &s;poke before me?&mdash;had not Love informed her, that in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, in figure, in fortune, and in mutual regard, Seymour and Cornelia are a couple un|commonly well-paired: they are, indeed, &s;o perfectly matched in the&s;e e&s;&s;ential points, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee them together without wi&s;hing them united.&mdash;"Aye, but my &s;weet
<PB N="92" REF="94">
Harriot, &s;ays the trembling con&s;cientious Cor|nelia, think of that tremendous article, Reli|gion! Remember the dying advice of my kind and provident Sedley! No, let me die by a malady more painful and more lingering than his, rather than act in oppo&s;ition to &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o benevolent, a coun&s;ellor." My dear Cornelia, I admire your virtuous &s;pirit&mdash;I am charmed with your re&s;olution; but do not di&s;quiet your gentle heart with the&s;e imaginary terrors; there may be no &s;uch ob&s;tacle as you &s;uppo&s;e in your way to happine&s;s.&mdash;"Nay, my good Harriot, why would you wi&s;h to flatter and delude me? Did not you your&s;elf, the other day, in &s;peaking of Seymour, allude to the univer&s;al opinion of his being an Infidel? You &s;poke indeed in je&s;t&mdash;a barbarous je&s;t&mdash;but you did not know how deeply you wounded this very fooli&s;h heart. Now I have laid open to you all its aching fibres, pray, my dear Harriot, drop a little oil upon them; and do not, I conjure you, do not ad|mini&s;ter to me any of tho&s;e dangerous medicines, which, under the pretence of healing a wound, only inflame and render it incurable.&mdash;Indeed I mu&s;t not think of Seymour&mdash;no, I never will think of him! I hope he will remain in Italy&mdash; I wi&s;h he may fall in love with Giuliana&mdash;'Tis very likely." Here a deep &s;igh; which made me exclaim, "Oh, you abominable lovely hy|pocrite! you have not any &s;uch wi&s;h in your heart; and if you ever forced your&s;elf to feel it for a moment, and heard of its being accom|pli&s;hed, it would &s;till make you half-frantic. Come, come, my dear Cornelia, there is really
<PB N="93" REF="95">
no occa&s;ion for any of the&s;e de&s;perate in&s;up|portable wi&s;hes; wi&s;h him a good godly hu&s;|band to your&s;elf, and try to make him &s;o. Who, my dear, could mould the rough arrogant mind of man better than &s;uch a gentle angel as your|&s;elf, when in&s;pired by the be&s;t motives, both of heaven and earth, true piety and cha&s;te affec|tion? Do we not read in hi&s;tory, that mo&s;t of the Gothic &s;overeigns in Europe were converted to Chri&s;tianity by their wives? After all, my dear, though we have allowed our&s;elves to talk freely of Seymour's wanting devotion; yet &s;urely he is not more deficient in that point than the general herd of young men who have been bred to his rank and fortune: they are all &s;o en|gro&s;&s;ed by plea&s;ure or ambition, that few can find time either to think or to hear of GOD. Indeed I believe the generality of men in all &s;ta|tions are little acquainted with devotional ideas, till towards the middle, or rather the latter &s;tage of their life; when, being &s;ettled in a dome&s;tic circle, and &s;eeing a new generation ri&s;e to &s;uc|ceed in their departments, they find it high time to reflect on a better world.</P>
<P>You know, my dear Cornelia, it was my &s;in|gular good fortune to fall into the arms of a man who&s;e amiable mind imbibed very early a deep &s;en&s;e of religion; but, as he has told me him|&s;elf, he was indebted for this ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ome remarkable incidents that happened to him in his youth, much more than to any in&s;truction. Religious as he is, no man can be more indul|gent to tho&s;e who differ from him&s;elf, though his &s;en&s;e of the beneficial influence which reli|gion
<PB N="94" REF="96">
has had, and &s;till has on his own happine&s;s, makes him wi&s;h mo&s;t cordiaally to &s;ee it more prevalent: his &s;entiments and di&s;cour&s;e on the levity of others are never violent or intru&s;ive. I know he mo&s;t &s;incerely admires all the gene|rous and all the agreeable qualities in Seymour; and I will venture to &s;ay, that no event in the world would give him more plea&s;ure than one which he thinks by no means improbable, and which I confe&s;s my&s;elf inclined to reckon in the cla&s;s of certainties: I mean, the event of our &s;eeing the engaging Seymour every thing we can wi&s;h him; or, to u&s;e the devout and gallant language of chivalry, mo&s;t perfect in his ho|mage, both to God and his fair-one."</P>
<P>'Twas thus, my dear Lucy, that I ran on, in my affectionate harangue to comfort and enliven the dear troubled Cornelia. I had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing her &s;weet countenance more and more ferene, as I proceeded, till at la&s;t her face grow|ing bright as the face of an angel, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed my hand, and exclaimed, in a tran&s;port from her fa|vourite tragedy of Zara:
<Q>Were he but Chri&s;tian, what could man be more!</Q></P>
<P>She uttered this line with &s;uch an air of fond and devout pa&s;&s;ion, and as &s;he &s;poke the po&s;&s;ibi|lity, or rather the hope, of being holily united to the only man &s;he has ever loved, gave &s;uch a rich and tender glow to her lovely features, that I never &s;aw any woman look &s;o <HI>gloriou&s;ly beautiful,</HI> to u&s;e a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of our admired Lady Wortley, as my dear comforted Cornelia looked in that moment, I believe I remained gazing at
<PB N="95" REF="97">
her, in mute delight, for a minute, as the plea|&s;ant traveller I have ju&s;t mentioned gazed on the fair Fatima at Adrianople: though the Turki&s;h lady, I grant, was a more dazzling figure, from the &s;plendid novelty of her dre&s;s, I am per&s;uaded &s;he was not equal in beauty to my incomparable friend; for, in the fir&s;t place, I can never think that black eyes can equal the delicious tenderne&s;s of blue; &s;econdly, the monotony of Turki&s;h love can hardly permit the face of a &s;ultana to expre&s;s that &s;weet and rich combination of intel|ligence, &s;entiment, and pa&s;&s;ion, which gave &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible charms to the countenance of Cor|nelia at the in&s;tant I am talking of. But this little digre&s;&s;ion on beauty, of which you know I am a great idolater, has detained me too much: I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to tell you, that we remained not long on tho&s;e tran&s;porting heights to which our &s;pirits were &s;uddenly carried. Cornelia &s;oon fell from the pinacle of hope, and I gently de&s;cended from that of admiration. Our conference took a more &s;ober turn, and clo&s;ed with a di&s;creet re&s;o|lution, not to enter into any warm arguments, either for or again&s;t the object of our debate; but to leave things as they now are to tho&s;e two great &s;ettlers of human doubts and perplexities, time and chance. In the mean time you will readily believe, that our eagerne&s;s to be favoured with all the di&s;patches you receive from the tra|vellers, is not in a way to be dimini&s;hed. Ex|clu&s;ive, indeed, of the intere&s;t Cornelia takes in his welfare, I am heartily concerned for Sey|mour's illne&s;s; both on his own account, and that of his intere&s;ting charge. Heaven &s;end us
<PB N="96" REF="98">
an early and good account of them! As to your remark, my dear Lucy, concerning the cha&s;te providential tendency of Seymour's illne&s;s, I mo&s;t heartily hope that you may be in the right; but I confe&s;s it &s;trikes me in the oppo&s;ite point of view, though I would not tell Cornelia &s;o for the world; and perhaps it is merely becau&s;e I remember a whim&s;ical &s;peech, made by a curi|ous old gentleman, who u&s;ed to vi&s;it my father very often, and delighted to make us girls laugh by the oddity of his remarks upon love and ma|trimony, his never-failing &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e. This &s;aid old gentleman once gave the following caution to my mother: "Madam," &s;aid he, with an arch and humorous &s;olemnity of face, "permit me to advi&s;e you never to employ a young woman to attend a &s;ick man, unle&s;s you wi&s;h to make a match between them; for I have always ob&s;erved in the&s;e ca&s;es, that the fir&s;t u&s;e which a convale&s;cent makes of his reviving &s;trength is, a grateful tender of it to his nur&s;e; and the good girl is &s;o delighted to &s;ee a &s;ick man growing well again, that &s;he has no heart to con|tradict him."</P>
<P>There's a &s;hort &s;tory for you, as an epilogue to the long one. Heaven grant it may make you &s;mile, without being any bad omen for Cornelia! Mercy on us! if any &s;uch things &s;hould happen, as the recollection of this non&s;en&s;ical old pro&s;er has put into my head: Deuce take him! for &s;tarting up in my memory; but not a word more, for here comes Cornelia, with two maps in her hand, to &s;hew me all the route of the tra|vellers. Ah, poor &s;tricken deer! Well I mu&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="99">
po&s;itively clo&s;e with all our love to you both. Dear girl, &s;end us &s;ome good news the fir&s;t mo|ment that you have it in your power: and re|member, that my pacquets to you are as volumi|nous as an old coun&s;ellor's opinion; &s;o pray imitate the lawyers on your part, and be not &s;paring in reply. Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>From my Batteau on the Rhone.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALIVE! alive, my dear Edmund! Behold me floating down the Rhone, by the &s;ide of the lovely and now &s;miling Giuliana. Do not therefore let your kind apprehen&s;ion &s;ugge&s;t to you, that I may be cro&s;&s;ing the Styx with old Charon: my pre&s;ent voyage is a thou&s;and times better; for I was never more di&s;po&s;ed in my life to reli&s;h the charms of this world. Every thing I &s;ee is beautiful, every thing I ta&s;te is delicious. If this is the u&s;ual effect of a recovery from &s;ick|ne&s;s, I would willingly be &s;ick once a-year. There is one thing, however, that puzzles me to account for: as you are a profound &s;peculator, and as you love to ruminate on the variety and oddity of human &s;en&s;ations, I propo&s;e to your
<PB N="98" REF="100">
&s;age wor&s;hip the following query for your &s;olu+tion: Why was I a good and faithful Platoni&s;t a month ago, when I was in the full vigour of health? and why, at this &s;ea&s;on, when I am lit|tle more than half re&s;tored from a &s;tate of debi|lity, why do I feel a de&s;perate inclination to the philo&s;ophy of Epicurus? What &s;trange creatures we are! It &s;eems to me as if all our wit and &s;tupidity, our wi&s;dom and folly, our virtues and vices, depended on a few drops, more or le&s;s, of the red, white, and yellow fluids, that are per|petually changing in the&s;e tragi-comical machines that we call human bodies. I am this moment a &s;triking illu&s;tration of my theory. I &s;eized a pen, all gaiety, to write you at lea&s;t the begin|ning of a gay epi&s;tle on board. The motion of the boat as I write has moved my bile, made me half &s;queami&s;h; and behold my gaiety turned to a dull di&s;&s;ertation on the mechani&s;m of man, of which, like many who have attempted to explain it, I know nothing. But this I know, that when the manly machine is out of tune, nothing can put it to &s;oon into harmony as placing it within the influence of an enchanting female; &s;o allow me to throw down the pen, and take a few turns on the &s;hort deck of our ve&s;&s;el with my &s;weet me&s;&s;mate Giuliana. I will fini&s;h this as &s;oon as we land at the village where we mean to dine.</P>
<P>I am now on &s;hore; but to&s;&s;ed at this moment in one of the mo&s;t di&s;quieting half-tempe&s;ts of heart and mind that I ever experienced Alas! my dear Edmund, I have played the fool mo&s;t abominably. I reproach my&s;elf, and, what is wor&s;e, I feel ince&s;&s;antly that I &s;till more de&s;erve
<PB N="99" REF="101">
your reproaches. But that you may not, from the&s;e imperfect intimations, &s;uppo&s;e my offences more flagrant than they have been, I will give you a very full and frank hi&s;tory of the extreme folly by which I have poi&s;oned the pure delight that, in &s;pite of &s;ickne&s;s it&s;elf, I had enjoyed, till this luckle&s;s day, in the faithful di&s;charge of my tru&s;t.</P>
<P>After a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and &s;hort day's voyage, the kind con&s;iderate Giuliana, thinking me more an invalid than I am, and de&s;irous that I &s;hould avoid the evening air on the river, con|trived for us to take a late dinner at a delightful village, where we are al&s;o to pa&s;s the night. Our hotel is a new and elegant little &s;tructure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uilt after an Engli&s;h model with bow windows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ommanding one of the mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;|pects that the eye can behold. Our landlady has been particularly recommended to Giuliana <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Lyons, and not without rea&s;on, for &s;he &s;eems to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e&s;s in very rare and happy proportions the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ity of France, and the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tne&s;s of Holland. In high delight with this &s;ingular and mo&s;t agreeable <HI>auberge,</HI> I and my lovely companion, after a cheerful dinner in one of its upper apart|ments, were leaning together on the open bow-window that commands this delicious country, when chance, or the devil, call it which you will, pre&s;ented a &s;ight to me that in an in&s;tant &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t fire to all the reviving wanton blood in my veins; yet it was by no means a &s;ight of licen|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous plea&s;ure, but one that rather favoured of primeval innocence and the golden age. Out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ndow commanded a very pretty cottage, with
<PB N="100" REF="102">
a little vineyard and flower-garden. The happy ma&s;ter of this diminutive kingdom is, it &s;eems, a Scotch Catholic, who, after pa&s;&s;ing a few years in the French &s;ervice, &s;ettled here with a very beautiful fair-one of this country. Having a pa&s;&s;ion for gardening, and being &s;till in the prime of life, he draws a mo&s;t healthy and de|lightful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ub&s;i&s;tence from wine, fruit, and flowers, the prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce of his little domain. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the vintage is all pa&s;t for this year; but it &s;eems this hone&s;t man has a &s;en&s;ible good-natured cu&s;tom of rewarding his hand&s;ome wife, and &s;weet children, for their labours in that bu&s;y &s;ea&s;on, by &s;aving for them, as a treat after their toil, a little portion of his mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fruit. We happened to behold him in the in&s;tant of collecting and di&s;tributing this re&s;erved trea&s;ure. Figure to your&s;elf, my dear Edmund, a fine tall military florid fellow, &s;tretching out his manly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rame at the top of a ladder, to reach &s;ome hunches of magnificent grapes, at the lofty ex|tremities of a broken rock, part of which he had fa&s;hioned into a garden-wall. Ob&s;erve towards the feet of the ladder a little golden-headed boy, like a cherubim, who has crept up four or five &s;teps, and is bolding up the hollow of his hat; while his mother, a woman as comely, as luxu|riant in beauty as Pomona her&s;elf, holds one &s;ide of the ladder, while two beautiful little girls (both older than the boy) &s;eem to delight them|&s;elves in thinking that they &s;upport the other. Behold the happy father de&s;cending with a neat open ba&s;ket, well filled, in his hand. His chil|dren form a little circle around him; each re|ceives
<PB N="101" REF="103">
a luxuriant bunch of grapes; each &s;miles with content and tran&s;port at the allotted &s;hare. Thus far all is well: but the hone&s;t man having ki&s;&s;ed each of his children, in di&s;tributing his pre&s;ents, upon delivering the re&s;idue of the fruit and the ba&s;ket to their &s;miling mother, throws his left arm around her, and gives her &s;o hearty a ki&s;s, a ki&s;s &s;o marvellou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ive of connu|bial happine&s;s, that an old hermit in &s;eeing it mu&s;t have longed for a wife. No words can tell you the kind of electric fire that it &s;eemed to communicate to all my fibres. Giuliana moved from the window, under the pretence of helping her&s;elf to a gla&s;s of water. I could not forbear following her; and I exclaimed, "What a cou|ple of &s;impletons are you and I, my dear Giuli|ana! You are &s;olicitous to &s;ave the &s;oul of a fa|ther who may not perhaps thank you for your intention; and I to gain the heart of a widow, who has, perhaps, already be&s;towed it on a more fortunate &s;uitor. How much wi&s;er would it be in both of us to &s;ettle together in this delicious country, and act the &s;weet &s;cene that we have ju&s;t beheld in a vineyard of our own!" In utter|ing the la&s;t word, I imprinted an ha&s;ty ki&s;s on her lips. I had never made the &s;lighte&s;t advance towards touching them before, and her extreme &s;urprize did not allow her either time or pre&s;ence of mind &s;ufficient to &s;hrink from my care&s;s: but if you wi&s;h to know how &s;he looked on the occa|&s;ion, imagine to your&s;elf, my dear Edmund; an Attic prie&s;te&s;s, in the moment of &s;eeing an altar which &s;he had guarded with the devoute&s;t fidelity prophaned by a barbarian. Indignant di&s;plea|&s;ure
<PB N="102" REF="104">
lightened from her eyes; her whole coun|tenance expre&s;&s;ed the rebuke of an offended angel; and I believe &s;he was on the point of uttering &s;ome words of great &s;everity, but &s;he checked her&s;elf, and remained &s;ilent a few mo|ments. I fancy my appearance affected her; it mu&s;t have been very &s;ingular; for the flame of wanton de&s;ire, which had, I confe&s;s, a momen|tary exi&s;tence in my bo&s;om, had &s;unk in the &s;mouldering vapour of vexation and remor&s;e. The agitation of the&s;e oppo&s;ite feelings had given &s;uch a tremulous weakne&s;s to my unbraced nerves, that I believe Giuliana &s;oon beheld me rather as an object of pity than of terror. I ab|&s;olutely had not power to &s;peak; and, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, Giuliana &s;aid with a plaintive gen|tlene&s;s of voice and manner, a thou&s;and times more affecting to me than any vehement acrimo|nious reproof could have been, "This is very wrong and very unexpected in my generous guide! Do not, Seymour, do not &s;o cruelly de|&s;troy the &s;incere &s;atisfaction I felt, in being the in&s;trument, under God, of pre&s;erving your life!" Clo&s;ing this tender reprimand with a look &s;till more expre&s;&s;ive of her own wounded feelings, &s;he left the room, and I felt as if I had heard my good genius &s;ay, "You are become unworthy of my care, and I abandon you to a legion of in|fernal tormentors." My heart indeed was full of &s;uch vi&s;itants: I traver&s;ed the room in vain to &s;hake them off, my attempts were equally fruit|le&s;s, whether I tried to rea&s;on, or to laugh my&s;elf out of my bitter vexation. Pho! non&s;en&s;e! &s;aid Pride, to comfort me. After all, what is your

mighty crime? barely touching the lip of a very beautiful woman, with whom you were alone. Aye, but, &s;ays Con&s;cience, you know there are certain &s;ituations in which a &s;imple ki&s;s may &s;eem an outrage, as cruel as ab&s;olute violation&punc; it is in the&s;e tender points where a delicate heart and mind are concerned,
<Q>That nothing is but thinking makes it &s;o.</Q>
Whatever &s;elf-flattery can &s;ugge&s;t in my defence, the troubled look of Giuliana, imprinted on my heart, refutes every &s;yllable of my delu&s;ive advo|cate. I find no relief but in the mo&s;t perfect re|pentance. When I had brought my mind into a tolerable calm, by penitent re&s;olutions of making all the atonement in my power for having &s;o un|gratefully offended my divine companion, I &s;ate down to give you this hi&s;tory.

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. FROM MISS AUDLEY TO MRS. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE back to your&s;elf, my dear Harriot, the fine title you be&s;towed on me. 'Tis you who are the real conjurer; you are the true prophete&s;s. O man! man! incon&s;tant abomi|nable man! in &s;ober truth now I could lamo&s;t weep to think that, in reply to your mo&s;t de|lightful hi&s;tory of Cornelia, I have a &s;orry anec|dote to tell you of her too agreeable infidel, who &s;eems to prove him&s;elf as unorthodox in the nice points of love and honour, as he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the e&s;&s;ential article of Religion. Alas! how would the tremulous heart of our poor Cor|nelia palpitate, if &s;he knew what I have learnt this morning! that the wicked rogue has been wantonly ki&s;&s;ing his lovely afflicted fellow-travel|ler.
<PB N="106" REF="108">
O Heavens! I hear you exclaim; but hu&s;h, hu&s;h, my dear Harriot; drop not a word, I conjure you, that may &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a torment|ing idea to the tender widow. In truth, all this terrific affair was nothing but the idle frolic of a moment; and the rogue has made him&s;elf &s;uch a frank confe&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much &s;incere contrition for his offence, that we ought perhaps to be rather quieted than alarmed by the incident. Let us act therefore as true Charity does with greater &s;inners, and conclude that his pa&s;t wick|edne&s;s will only furni&s;h him with a &s;urer foun|dation for his future virtue. You and I, my dear Harriot, may re&s;t perhaps on this conclu|&s;ion; but it would not do for the di&s;quieted Cor|nelia. I know, by woeful experience, that ideas which act as an opiate on the moderate appre|hen&s;ions of Friend&s;hip, may produce nothing but an increa&s;e of irritation on the wild and feveri&s;h terrors of Love. Pray ob&s;erve what a wondrous philo&s;opher I grow, in living &s;o much with our dear &s;peculative Edmund. Indeed, he kindly lets me into many my&s;teries, to which I &s;hould be otherwi&s;e an utter &s;tranger; and the knowledge of them has no little influence in &s;e|curing that degree of content which I have hap|pily recovered. There was a time, you may re|member, when I wi&s;hed to be a young man, of a good figure, and an independent fortune; &s;up|po&s;ing, as I believe many mi&s;&s;es &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a character &s;ports in the world at his plea|&s;ure, as in a perfect paradi&s;e. I have now very different ideas of this being, once &s;o envied; an opulent young man, of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, acute
<PB N="107" REF="109">
&s;en&s;ibility, and with no well-&s;ettled principles, &s;uch in &s;hort as they mo&s;t of them are, &s;uch a character, I &s;ay, now &s;trikes me as re&s;embling the dancers that I have read of in &s;ome barbarous nation, who twi&s;t, torture, and wound them|&s;elves a thou&s;and horrible ways, under the name of gaiety and diver&s;ion: it is true, indeed, as Rowe, has &s;weetly told us,
<Q><L>That man, the lawle&s;s libertine, may rove</L>
<L>Free and unque&s;tion'd thro' the wilds of love.</L></Q></P>
<P>But what does he generally find in the&s;e rov|ings, &s;o delightful to a young and credulous fancy? what are his adventures in this alluring wild? Why, truly, at one thicket he encounters a tigre&s;s; in another he is &s;lung by an adder; or, if he is one of the lucky mortals who meet with a milder de&s;tiny in this &s;aid variegated wild, &s;till, in &s;tooping to gather a primro&s;e, it is ten to one but he pricks his fingers again&s;t an hedge|hog. But what a &s;imple chattering monkey am I my&s;elf, in thus running into a fanta&s;tic di&s;&s;er|tation on libertines, when I only meant to a&s;&s;ure you, in a few &s;imple words, that you and your lovely friend may be perfectly ea&s;y concerning the health of our intere&s;ting travellers! I wi&s;h of all things to inclo&s;e to you Seymour's letter to Edmund; but the rigid philo&s;opher &s;ays, No: adding with a kind of &s;everity, "If Cornelia &s;hould accidentally catch a &s;ight of the hand, and petition for a peru&s;al of the letter, the &s;ym|pathetic Harriot has not fortitude enough to re|fu&s;e; nor could &s;he, indeed, with any very good grace." You mu&s;t allow there is &s;ome rea&s;on, as
<PB N="108" REF="110">
well as good-nature, in this argument; &s;o if your curio&s;ity, my dear Harriot, teizes you a lit|tle on this point, as I fear it will, I can only &s;ay, as Hamlet does to his dear Horatio,
<Q>O'erma&s;ter it as you may.</Q></P>
<P>I ought, perhaps, to proceed like Hamlet; and bind you, by a &s;olemn form of adjuration: &s;o come, my dear, prepare your&s;elf to take the oath I require; &s;wear to me upon your fan (which is a lady's &s;word); &s;wear, I &s;ay,
<Q><L>Not to make known what you have heard to night,</L>
<L>Nor, by pronouncing of &s;ome doubtful phra&s;e;</L>
<L>Nor, by ambiguous giving out, denote,</L>
<L>That you know aught from me.</L></Q></P>
<P>I would not, for the world, be accidentally the in&s;trument to wound your Cornelia; I mo&s;t cor|dially wi&s;h her happy, though I fear &s;he has but little chance of being &s;o: I know how dangerous it is to love a man for whom our e&s;teem cannot keep pace with our affection. But away with the&s;e gloomy pre&s;ages: Heaven ble&s;s her to the utmo&s;t of her fond expectation, and pre&s;erve me as I am, <Q>In maiden meditation fancy-free!</Q></P>
<P>A curious prayer this on my part, when I am ju&s;t &s;allying forth to take captive the noble Gene|ral who has lately &s;ettled in our neighbourhood! We are to dine with him to-day; I dre&s;&s;ed very early on purpo&s;e (not to captivate him, my dear, but) to &s;cribble to you, without the dread of &s;cribbling, as you know I have &s;ometimes done,
<PB N="109" REF="111">
without thinking of my dre&s;s till the very mo|ment the carriage was ordered. Among my late philo&s;ophical ob&s;ervations I have ob&s;erved, there is nothing which the lordly creature man di&s;likes more than to be made to wait for a woman who has no means of repaying him for her delay.</P>
<P>Well, here is the dear lordly Edmund him&s;elf ju&s;t come into my room, to tell me the chariot is at the door; and let me add, there is a new hor&s;e to it, which is &s;o like a man, that he can|not wait with patience, and is at this in&s;tant pawing up the new-laid gravel under his feet. Hor&s;e and man, be as impatient as ye plea&s;e, I cannot lay down my pen till I have told my dear Harriot the &s;aucy &s;peech Edmund has ju&s;t made to me; e&s;pecially as he delivered it as a kind of maxim for the grand purpo&s;e of teaching a &s;pin|&s;ter how to chu&s;e a hu&s;band: "Come, Lucy, &s;aid my dear dictator, come, and &s;et your cap at the General: the love of a young man is like a dram; if it does not intoxicate, it inflames and undermines the health; but the love of a man in middle life is like wine; it does not agitate the animal &s;pirits too furiou&s;ly, but only acts as an excellent &s;tomachick." So you &s;ee, my dear Harrriot, if I take the General, it is nothing more than taking a gla&s;s of port by the advice of my phy&s;ician. But, as you know I hate to fol|low pre&s;criptions, I tru&s;t you will &s;ee me like a wi&s;e invalid, recover all my natural gaiety, by prudently and re&s;olutely ab&s;taining from all cor|dials whatever. From this &s;crawl I think you may conclude that I am growing as great a rattle as I u&s;ed to be.&mdash;Mercy, the hor&s;e has begun to

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE offended angel has forgiven me. But I am not yet reconciled to my&s;elf. My tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, indeed, admits of palliation&mdash;and it might have been infinitely greater. But what a &s;orry apology is this, my dear Edmund! Was not Adam, as they tell us, bani&s;hed from Para|di&s;e for ta&s;ting the tree of knowledge; though he touched not the tree of life? I feel like Adam; I feel exiled from a mental Paradi&s;e, which I have ba&s;ely forfeited, and can hope to enter no more: I may indeed de&s;cribe the divine Giuliana as the Adam of Milton de&s;cribes Heaven after his offence,
<Q>I &s;aw her placable and mild.</Q>
And I may al&s;o &s;ay of my&s;elf, that I have
<Q><L>many days</L>
<L>Give me of grace, wherein I may repeat,</L>
<L>And one bad act with many deeds well done</L>
<L>May cover.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113">But I feel that the&s;e days of mine, like tho&s;e of poor Adam after his fall, mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;tate very different from my forfeited felicity. Though Giuliana, who has &s;een me not only penitent, but half-ill again with chagrin and vexation, has treated me with great indulgence and kindne&s;s; yet I too plainly perceive it is not in her own power to recall tho&s;e pure, tho&s;e tender, tho&s;e deliciou&s;ly flattering &s;en&s;ations of &s;i&s;terly love to|wards me, which my folly has di&s;pelled. I have heard tho&s;e who drink more freely than we do, my dear Edmond, declare, that there is a cer|tain pitch of plea&s;ure as you approach towards intoxication, which gives you an idea of coele&s;tial delight. I cannot &s;ay I have felt this to the ex|qui&s;ite degree they de&s;cribe in any convivial fe&s;tivity; but I maintain there is &s;omething which an&s;wers their de&s;cription in a certain pe|riod of perfect friend&s;hip, with a mode&s;t, beau|tiful, afflicted woman. In the cha&s;te familiarity and entire confidence of Giuliana, there was an inexpre&s;&s;ible charm, which approached nearer to angelic bli&s;s than all the raptures of triumphant love; like a brutal idiot as I was, I have de&s;troy|ed this charm for ever; &s;ince, as I have told you already, it is not in the power of the lovely for|giving angel her&s;elf to re&s;tore it. But I will cea&s;e to weary you with this fruitle&s;s lamentation, and tell you the progre&s;s of our journey.</P>
<P>After a mo&s;t tranquil voyage, in which the three gentle&s;t elements, water, earth, and air, &s;eemed to &s;mile upon us as if they vied with each other in a wi&s;h to plea&s;e us, we arrived la&s;t night at Avignon. Our progre&s;s down the Rhone,
<PB N="112" REF="114">
which is by no means &s;o rapid as I expected to find it, would have proved indeed a perfect jaunt of plea&s;ure, if our minds had been in harmony with the &s;cene around us; but this was far from being the ca&s;e: poor Giuliana was frequently ab|&s;orbed in melancholy reveries; and as to my&s;elf, being neither &s;ick nor well, nor happy nor wretched, my affections and my imagination, in&s;tead of doing what they ought to have done, in&s;tead of contributing to the proper and &s;alutary exerci&s;e of each other, &s;eemed to have &s;unk into a &s;tupid and dete&s;table lethargy together. I did not look indeed on this &s;miling face of nature with &s;uch malignant eyes as the devil ca&s;t upon Eden, for I had not vivacity enough in my frame to feel the pa&s;&s;ion of envy; but I &s;tared with heavy, &s;our, and mo&s;t uncomfortable apathy, upon a &s;eries of animated &s;cenes, from which I had ex|pected to catch a tender gaiety of heart, and &s;prightline&s;s of fancy. As we drew near Avig|non, I could not help ob&s;erving to Giuliana, that we had both di&s;covered &s;omewhat of ungrateful in&s;en&s;ibility to the extreme finene&s;s of our wea|ther, and pro&s;perity of our voyage. She an&s;wer|ed by a happy quotation of the&s;e charming words from Meta&s;ta&s;io (which I hope you and your fair fellow &s;tudent Lucy are by this time able to con|&s;true),
<Q LANG="ita"><L>Secondo in guerra, o in pace</L>
<L>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vano il <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;tro cor</L>
<L>Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iano di color</L>
<L>Tutu gli oggetti,</L></Q></P>
<Q LANG="eng"><PB N="113" REF="115">[All objects change their colour, in propor|tion as they find war or peace in our hearts.]</Q>
<P>This quotation applicable to both. I have al|ready given you too long an account of my own feelings, the poor rickety children of Indi&s;po&s;i|tion and Folly; two mi&s;erable parents! Tho&s;e of Giuliana had a nobler pedigree; and de&s;erve a more ample hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The great &s;atisfaction, I may &s;ay the tran&s;ient delight, which her feeling &s;pirit received from my recovery, was &s;oon over-ca&s;t by many cloudy thoughts. She has endured much pain, not in|deed from the recurring force of her former affliction; nor from that di&s;quieting incident of the ki&s;s, which my mi&s;ty imagination has mag|nified, perhaps, to a very fooli&s;h degree, in all that I have &s;aid to you upon it.&mdash;The divine Giuliana, has adopted a new and much deeper &s;ource of di&s;quietude. Her benevolent and tender mind will intere&s;t it&s;elf in a point that I have weakly &s;uffered to become the &s;ubject of her thoughts, though I did not mean that it &s;hould ever fall within her knowledge, or even within her &s;u&s;|picion. This &s;ounds a little like the language of an Iri&s;hman; but a few words will make the bull, if it is one, intelligible.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that during my fever at Lyons I had two days of delirium; in which they tell me I made &s;ome very curious remarks concerning the immaculate conception, and di|ver&s;e articles in the birth, parentage, and edu|cation, of a certain my&s;terious Per&s;onage, whom I &s;hould rather have &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf likely to mention in the words a&s;cribed to the lively Are|tine:
<PB N="114" REF="116">
<HI>"Io no'l cono&s;co"</HI>&mdash;I do not know him&punc; This pa&s;&s;ed as delirious raving; &s;o in truth it was: yet had I been in Spain, perhaps the good folks of the Inqui&s;ition might have kindly cured my fever by application of their &s;alutary fire.</P>
<P>What e&s;caped from me in my frenzy dwelt on the compa&s;&s;ionate mind of Giuliana; at various times &s;he di&s;covered a half-repre&s;&s;ed and half-in|dulged inclination to &s;earch into my religious opinions. Though you know there is nothing in the world that I dete&s;t &s;o much as hypocri&s;y, I re&s;olved on this head to play the hypocrite with my lovely companion, on account of her tender afflicted &s;pirits. I was plea&s;ed, however, to ob|&s;erve, that in her own remarks on various con|vents that we have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf perfectly purified from the non&s;en&s;ical bigotry of her country. I find that Peverell had taken pecu|liar pains to eradicate from her mind all the no|tions of Catholic &s;uper&s;tition; but at the &s;ame time he attached her mo&s;t firmly to his own per|&s;ua&s;ion. With love for his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, what tenet might he not have &s;tolen from her mind! what might he not have implanted on her tender heart! In conver&s;ing with her on the&s;e topics, I was &s;o charmed with the &s;trength and lu&s;tre of her na|tural under&s;tanding, that I &s;uffered my own na|tive &s;incerity to triumph over my prudence. I talked to her as if I was talking to you; and as &s;he had led me to &s;peak of Hume, Bolingbroke, and Voltaire, expre&s;&s;ed my wonder that &s;uch a triumvirate, uniting all the powers of rea&s;on, eloquence, and wit, had not bani&s;hed a decaying &s;uper&s;tition from every cultivated mind. But all
<PB N="115" REF="117">
our debates on this &s;ubject have ended as I be|lieve every conference is apt to do between a man and a woman who differ very widely on any in|tere&s;ting theme. Arguments have no efficacy oppo&s;ed to feelings. The man lo&s;es &s;ome por|tion of his e&s;teem for the intellects of the wo|man; and the woman cea&s;es to revere and to confide in the heart of the man. Do not &s;up|po&s;e, however, that, like mo&s;t theological di&s;|putants, we are become bitter enemies: no, never did you hear of two polemics &s;o tender and benevolent to each other. Our di&s;putes have indeed &s;ome vivacity, but not a particle of acrimonious malignity. You would have been much affected, had you heard the clo&s;e of our la&s;t; when Giuliana, with that graceful energy of ge&s;ture &s;o peculiar to her&s;elf, fell on one knee, and exclaimed, "O my dear Peverell, if I have loved, and continue to love thee, with a fidelity of affection agreeable to thy pure &s;pirit, grant me, before I die, to behold this generous, but mi&s;guided young man, made as happy as thou wert upon earth in the knowledge of thy GOD!" The pathetic kindne&s;s of this little prayer pierced me to the &s;oul. I ki&s;&s;ed her hand, bathed it with a tear, and begged that we might drop the &s;ub|ject for ever.</P>
<P>So ended our conference la&s;t night in this an|tient re&s;idence of the popes. Never did one of tho&s;e keen &s;anctified &s;en&s;uali&s;ts labour to make a convert to their intere&s;t or their plea&s;ure (which were the main points of their pur&s;uit, you know, in this city), with a fervency of &s;pirit equal to that of the dear devout Giuliana. And, zealous
<PB N="116" REF="118">
as &s;he is, I may give her the prai&s;e &s;o rarely de|&s;erved by any Religioni&s;ts in truly &s;aying, that her charity is &s;till &s;uperior to her zeal.</P>
<P>Before we retired to our &s;eparate pillows, the good creature, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;tate of my bodily and mental health equally un&s;ound, made me promi&s;e to re&s;t a couple of days in this city, be|fore I &s;uffer my&s;elf to be &s;haken over the rocky roads of Provence. As &s;he withdrew to her chamber &s;he &s;aid, "I will engage to amu&s;e you to-morrow; and I &s;hall lead you to make an atonement for &s;ome or your pa&s;t offences at the tomb of Laura, which we &s;hall find, they tell me, within a very &s;hort walk from this hou&s;e." She &s;aid this to me in her own &s;oft language, and with a &s;weetne&s;s of manner that no language in the world could perfectly de&s;cribe; her features in the moment expre&s;&s;ed a mixture of melancho|ly and benevolent, that affected me in a marvel|lous degree. And I uttered to my&s;elf, as I with|drew from her to my own apartment,
<Q LANG="ita"><L>L'amour n'a rien de &s;i tendre,</L>
<L>Ni l'amiti&eacute; de &s;i douce.</L></Q></P>
<Q LANG="eng">[Love has nothing &s;o tender: Friend&s;hip no|thing &s;o &s;weet.]</Q>
<P>My angelic fellow-traveller having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me to my own chamber with a fancy &s;o full of gentle ideas, procured me a dream of happine&s;s in a fortunate vi&s;ionary marriage with Cornelia&mdash; that I am de&s;tined perhaps to &s;ee only in a dream. On ri&s;ing this morning, I found the &s;cene very di&s;mally altered: not only the delights of my

vi&s;ion were fled; but the elements, as if angry with us for our in&s;en&s;ibility to their &s;miles, have begun to frown upon us in a manner very unex|pected: an un&s;ea&s;onable and violent rain has been falling for &s;everal hours; and my good governe&s;s Giuliana, who is full of fears for me without any for her&s;elf, has in&s;i&s;ted on my not venturing abroad; and thus given me an oppor|tunity of &s;cribbling to you a letter enormou&s;ly long, and as dull as the weather. As to Giuliana, &s;he has de&s;erted me, and is &s;allied forth, under the protection of Robert and a very ample umbrella. She has promi&s;ed not to vi&s;it the tomb of Laura without me; and I rather &s;u&s;pect, from a word &s;he dropt at her departure, that &s;he is gone to a book&s;eller's in que&s;t of &s;ome favourite religious author, whom &s;he wi&s;hes to make her coadjutor in the grand project of my conver&s;ion.&mdash; Heaven ble&s;s her!&mdash;I begin to grow re&s;tle&s;s at her long ab&s;ence, and often turn an anxious eye from my paper to the &s;treet. Oh, there &s;he is; I &s;py her from the window this in&s;tant on her return; and with a face of &s;uch joyous animation, that, in|&s;tead of having picked an old du&s;ty theologian from an ob&s;cure &s;helf, I could almo&s;t believe &s;he has conjured the &s;oul of poor Peverell out of Paradi&s;e to attend her. What can this mean? But joy is ever welcome; and e&s;pecially when it approaches in a form of &s;uch tenderne&s;s and beauty. &mdash; Here &s;he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Edmund, and no le&s;s dear Lucy, how kind, how con&s;iderate, how unlike the con|duct of common friends, and worthy of your own quick and benevolent &s;pirits, was your for|tunate
<PB N="118" REF="120">
idea of di&s;patching a pacquet &s;o delightful, with a chance of catching us on our road! Your obliging friends, the two lively brothers, who are galloping towards Rome, luckily drove into Avignon, while the faithful Robert was waiting for his mi&s;tre&s;s at the door of the book&s;eller I have mentioned. My lord's valet happened to be an old acquaintance of Robert's; and after &s;haking the hone&s;t fellow by the hand, informed him, that his ma&s;ter had letters for me. Robert in|&s;tantly imparted the&s;e glad tidings to Giuliana, who, wi&s;hing to have the delight of delivering the pacquet to me her&s;elf, de&s;ired to have it brought to her where &s;he was. This mo&s;t welcome, this tran&s;porting pacquet, is now in my hands; but before I reply to a line of it, I mu&s;t exclaim, like &s;ome happy being who&s;e name I have forgot: "Heaven, I had a &s;oul to endure pain; now give me one to &s;upport delight!" I believe, in|deed, that the good Giuliana thought me &s;inking into a new &s;ort of delirium, when &s;he beheld me ki&s;&s;ing in an ec&s;tacy that enchanting mor&s;el of paper on which the ble&s;&s;ed hand of Lucy a&s;&s;ures me, "that, if Cornelia has a par|tiality for any man on earth, it is unque&s;tionably for me;" and then bids me "de&s;erve her."&mdash; De&s;erve her! O ye powers who pre&s;ide over love and felicity, what would I not do to de&s;erve her!</P>
<Q><L>By Heaven, methinks it were an ea&s;y leap</L>
<L>To pluck bright Honour from the pale-fac'd moon.</L></Q>
<P>Aye, verily, my dear Edmund, I would do more for Love than the noble Hot&s;pur could me|ditate
<PB N="119" REF="121">
for honour.&mdash;But here comes my divine monitor, to moderate my rapture. I have &s;crib|bled the&s;e few ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ions of joy and grati|tude, while Giuliana has been adju&s;ting her dre&s;s for our vi&s;it to the church of the Cordeliers. &mdash;Your charming and magical letter &s;eems to have given &s;erenity to the &s;ky, as well as to our hearts; 'tis a delicious afternoon, and we are ju&s;t &s;allying forth to pay our devotions at the grave of Laura.</P>
<Q><L>To &s;ee that buried du&s;t of living fame,</L>
<L>Who&s;e tomb fair Love and fairer Virtue kept.</L></Q>
<P>I &s;hall &s;till add to this voluminous letter before we leave Avignon; but I will not lay down the pen, even for a &s;hort pau&s;e, without a&s;&s;uring you, that the tender Giuliana takes a mo&s;t friendly, I may &s;ay, lively intere&s;t, in tho&s;e tran&s;ports of hope which have &s;o kindly awakened in my re-animated frame; and &s;till more does &s;he &s;hare with me in the &s;incere joy that I receive from the&s;e utterly unexpected, and therefore more de|lightful a&s;&s;urances of your welfare, and your re|gard for the two travellers, who both love you and your &s;i&s;ter with all the warmth that friend&s;hip and gratitude can in&s;pire.</P>
<P>We are now ju&s;t preparing for our departure from this remarkable city; who&s;e curio&s;ities have entertained us beyond my expectation: but it is to you, my dear friends, di&s;tant as ye are, that we are indebted even for this entertainment; for, had not your enchanting letter put us into tune, I &s;hould have continued to &s;tare at the objects that

&s;olicited my notice with all the &s;peen of Smel fungus. What curious machines we are!&mdash;the human heart appears to me like a clock, good for nothing unle&s;s frequently wound up by the hand of affection: you have now converted mine into a fine time-piece of ornamental and lively me|chani&s;m, in which a multitude of the mo&s;t chear|ful little images are at work together, by means of that mighty &s;pring which you have &s;o happily put in motion.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I may reward you by accompli&s;hing every thing you wi&s;h with the father of Giuliana.&mdash;I think I &s;hall; and ground my hopes on &s;ome par|ticular lines in his character, which I have col|lected from her, and will tell you hereafter. I mu&s;t now ha&s;tily clo&s;e the&s;e voluminous di&s;patches; but not without telling you how ardently we wi&s;hed that you and Lucy could have &s;hared the pen&s;ive delight we enjoyed at the tomb of Laura. We were fortunate, however, in our attendant, hav|ing met with the mo&s;t polite and intelligent prie&s;t that ever fell in my way. He was enchanted with Giuliana, who, in&s;pired by the &s;cene, re|peated &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of Petrarch with a grace and pathos of magical, that I expected to &s;ee the &s;hade &s;o Laura expre&s;&s;ing her &s;atisfaction in the&s;e plea&s;ing honours. Giuliana will not allow the &s;onnet to be genuine which was found in the tomb, and which our books of travels exhibit to you as copied from the hand-writing of Petrarch. &mdash;Apropos of poets: the polite Cordelier I have ju&s;t mentioned, ob&s;erving our pa&s;&s;ion for poetry, and hearing that we were to travel acro&s;e Provence, has kindly recommended to my peru&s;al a Latin

poetical epi&s;tle of the famous Chancellor de l'Hopital, de&s;cribing the country we are to pa&s;s.

If I find his ver&s;es equal to the prai&s;e with which the friendly Cordelier recommended them to me, you &s;hall hear more of them in my next: I can now only add, that Giuliana and I be&s;tow on you, and the dear compa&s;&s;ionate Lucy, our mo&s;t cordial benedictions.&mdash;Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. CORNELIA TO MRS. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! my very dear, and too penetrating Harriot, how much better do you under|&s;tand your poor confu&s;ed Cornelia, than &s;he un|der&s;tands, her&s;elf! How perfectly verified do I now find the words which you &s;poke to me with &s;uch tender raillery in pre&s;&s;ing me to remain lon|ger under your friendly roof: when you told me, than tearing my troubled heart from the comfort of your &s;ympathetic conver&s;ation, to fortify it in the &s;olitude of my own dreary man&s;ion, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aking a child out of leading-&s;trings, before it had &s;trength to go alone! A child indeed, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">et confidante! a very weak child, I confe&s;s!
<PB N="122" REF="124">
and as unfit, I perceive, to be left alone as any infant of the nur&s;ery! Why do they tell us, that "&s;olitude is the nur&s;e of &s;en&s;e." It maybe &s;o perhaps with man&mdash;but with woman, I fear, it is only the nur&s;e of folly, and the cheri&s;her of pa&s;&s;ion. At lea&s;t, my dear Harriot, I will ho|ne&s;tly confe&s;s to you, that it proves &s;o with your weak Cornelia.&mdash;What different hopes had I conceived! What a &s;age heroine did I fancy my&s;elf, in accompli&s;hing my painful re&s;olution of quitting the daily conver&s;e of that beloved friend, who&s;e too tender indulgence to my dan|gerous prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I conceived to be a delicious poi&s;on to my quiet; if not to my integrity! In the delu&s;ive pride of good intention, I expected that the &s;cenery here would re&s;tore me to peace; as I knew that every object around me would &s;et the poor departed Sedley mo&s;t forcibly before my eyes. I hoped to grow &s;trong in the contem|plation of his virtue; and to impre&s;s &s;till deeper on my heart the kind religious admonition, which his dying tenderne&s;s be&s;towed on me. I am very far from feeling none of the impre&s;&s;ions which I expected this habitation to make upon my mind. In &s;ome moments perhaps, I feel &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions too &s;trongly, like a per&s;on who&s;e fits of feveri&s;h &s;trength are &s;ucceeded by a proportionate weakne&s;s. You have entreated me to give you a very full and frank account of all my &s;en&s;ations; and &s;urely you, who have taken &s;uch generous pains to tranquillize my bo|&s;om, have an unque&s;tionable right to enquire into all its emotions. But do not tell me, dear Harriot, that I delight in very iniquitous &s;elf-accu&s;ation,
<PB N="123" REF="125">
when I &s;ay, that I am &s;ometimes too &s;eraphic, and &s;ometimes infinitely too like the weake&s;t of mortals. When I &s;et my foot in the library of poor Sedley, which is ju&s;t as he left it, every volume &s;eems to &s;peak to me of its buried ma&s;ter; and the piercing eyes of his por|trait, over the chimney, &s;earch my very &s;oul; bani&s;h from me, as long as I behold them, every perilous propen&s;ity; and in&s;pite me with a vain wi&s;h for the faculty of proving both a mother and a father to the dear boys he has left me.&mdash; I want not, indeed, any monitor to quicken the energy of my maternal feelings. My &s;weet lit|tle ones engro&s;s and amu&s;e the greater part of my day. But there are hours, you know, my dear Harriot, in which our children cea&s;e to be our companions. When I have re&s;igned my two lovely boys to their early re&s;t, and read William to &s;leep, which he generally wheedles me to do, I have &s;till &s;ome pen&s;ive hours to my&s;elf; and tho&s;e very hours, perhaps, in which a tender heart is mo&s;t inclined to indulge it&s;elf in fooli&s;h tenderne&s;s. As I am pa&s;&s;ionately fond, you know, of a contemplative walk at the clo&s;e of day, I frequently take a late ramble alone to that &s;ide of the park from whence I can ca&s;t an eye of pious meditation upon the grave of my poor Sedley.&mdash;The &s;pot never fails to draw me into a very &s;oothing religious reverie; and at the&s;e times, indeed, "I am in Heaven with him." But, alas! my Harriot, in proportion as I ad|vance in my return to the hou&s;e, my cele&s;tial thoughts fade away, and a living image &s;teals upon my mind&mdash;the bewitching figure of the too

He tells me, with that tender but re&s;pectful in&s;inuation which baffles all re&s;i&s;tance, in our vi&s;ionary intercour&s;e, "that, in&s;tead of being &s;uch a dangerous cha|racter as my dear dying monitor wi&s;hed me to avoid, he is exactly the rever&s;e; the very pro|tector that Sedley wi&s;hed me to acquire: full of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted love to me, and of the fonde&s;t affection to my promi&s;ing little or|phans." &mdash;Ah! my dear Harriot, this vi&s;ionary intruder on my quiet has learned to plead his cau&s;e with all your fa&s;cinating arguments; but even the&s;e mu&s;t not avail him; for, O my deare&s;t Harriot, excellent creature as you are, in this one point, alas!

&s;ubjects. Before I di&s;patch this pacquet by the ru&s;tic courier, who, to avoid the long circuit and delay of the po&s;t, is to pa&s;s regularly every fortnight by the &s;hort private road between us, I will endeavour to amu&s;e you with two incidents of a very different nature, that have happened &s;ince my return.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a little rural adventure, that af|fected me very much. As your &s;i&s;ter Lucy has often talked of amu&s;ing us with a novel of her own compo&s;ition, pray tell her, that I think her lively genius might rai&s;e an admirable little pocket volume from the &s;ingular &s;tory I am going to tell you. As I have not the talents of our dear Lucy for embelli&s;hment, I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with giving you the &s;imple matter of fact.</P>
<P>You know that the humane di&s;po&s;ition of poor Sedley made him, not only the friend, but the phy&s;ician of the poor; and during hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> long illne&s;s I have been u&s;ed to act as his deputy in that character. As I was taking an afternoon walk with the children and their maid, near the private door of the park, that open on the little common, I &s;aw a lad running with great violence towards us, and opened the door, to enquire into the cau&s;e of his agitation. As &s;oon as he could collect &s;ufficient breath he informed me, that the maid at the farm, which you &s;ee from the gate I have mentioned, was fallen into ter|rible fits, and he was bid to run as fa&s;t as he could to the Great Hou&s;e for <HI>Madam's advice.</HI> I was very ready to obey the &s;ummons; and &s;ending Nanny home with the children, I order|ed
<PB N="127" REF="129">
her to di&s;patch the grave and experienced Philip after me, with &s;ome pungent re&s;toratives. A walk of little more than half a mile brought me to the beautiful poor excruciated patient. I wi&s;h I had the talent of de&s;cription, to give you a perfect image of the &s;cene that now pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my attention. Figure to your&s;elf, my dear Harriot, a fair, florid, robu&s;t, luxuriant beauty of nineteen, under the horrid influence of agonies that made her large di&s;torted eyes roll like meteors, and her two even rows of &s;trong white teeth grind each other with convul&s;ive fe|rocity: but I need not &s;trive to paint for you a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing figure, of which you have al|mo&s;t a real portrait in your own hou&s;e, from the pencil of Rubens. In the &s;ublime &s;ketch (which your good hu&s;band values &s;o highly) of the Saint preparing to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s two Female Demoniacs, you have a very forcible repre&s;enta|tion of my unhappy patient at the moment I fir&s;t beheld her. I &s;hould &s;ay, however, that &s;he is a thou&s;and times more beautiful than the younge&s;t figure of Rubens, though her form has all that rich, mu&s;cular beauty in which he de|lighted. The humanity of the farmer and his wife had placed the poor creature in their be&s;t chamber; but her contor&s;ions were &s;o violent, that four very &s;trong men could hardly hold her down on the bed, and could not prevent her expo&s;ing to our view her whole bo&s;om, which &s;eemed to be di&s;tended and tortured with inter|nal fire, though it retained the mo&s;t &s;nowy whitene&s;s that I ever beheld in a human &s;kin. You will think, her beauty mu&s;t be great indeed,
<PB N="128" REF="130">
when I tell you, the idea of it forced it&s;elf upon me in &s;pite of all the torment under which I beheld it, and which I felt the mo&s;t &s;incere anxiety to relieve. By various applications I had &s;oon the delight of relea&s;ing her from the&s;e horrible convul&s;ions. I then de&s;ired to be left alone with her, and, &s;eating my&s;elf on the &s;ide of her bed, prepared to admini&s;ter in &s;oothing conver&s;ation a cordial to her heart, from whence I &s;u&s;pected this tremendous malady to have ari&s;en. Ah! my dear Harriot, what a furious di&s;temper is this pe&s;tilent Love! How can you be &s;o cruel as to aim at per&s;uading me to re|&s;ign my bo&s;om to the dominion of &s;uch a De|mon! All the terrific contor&s;ions I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed to you were in truth the &s;port of this tyrant. By expre&s;&s;ing what I really felt, a great de&s;ire to be her friend, I drew from the good &s;imple girl all the &s;ecrets of her agitated bo&s;om. A young black&s;mith, it &s;eems, who has, I &s;up|po&s;e, no re&s;emblance to Vulcan but in his trade, his obtained an ab&s;olute &s;way over the heart of this ru&s;tic Venus; and the immediate cau&s;e of her tremendous agony was nothing more than this petty circum&s;tance. The barbarous Cyclops, as Lucy would call him, had been at a neigh|bouring fair the preceding day, and had pa&s;&s;ed the abode of the dam&s;el without bringing her a knot of remembrance, or calling to &s;ay a kind word to her, either as he went or as he returned. The &s;prightly Lucy, who thinks &s;he has courage enough to whip the malicious little archer Cu|pid with his own broken arrows, would, I be|lieve, with her benevolent plea&s;antry, have ral|lied
<PB N="129" REF="131">
my &s;imple patient out of her &s;ufferings; and, by teaching her to laugh at her own fond|ne&s;s, would have her, in a new fit of mirthful &s;hame, hide her fine blu&s;hing face under the bedclothes. But I, who am as far as po&s;&s;ible from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our dear Lucy's invaluable fa|culty of laughing away pain either from my&s;elf or from another, I was obliged to pur&s;ue an op|po&s;ite &s;y&s;tem for the relief of my intere&s;ting pa|tient. Not having either the talent, or the di&s;|po&s;ition, to make her laugh with me, I indulg|ed all my own weakne&s;s, and began, very &s;ym|pathetically, to weep with her; there was, in truth, &s;uch a natural and affecting &s;implicity in the poor girl's account of the angui&s;h of heart &s;he had endured, and of her ineffectual &s;trug|gle to &s;uppre&s;s it, that I am almo&s;t inclined to think the gay Lucy her&s;elf would have wept at the recital. My &s;ympathy was not without &s;ome good effect; by flattering the hone&s;t creature's pride, it &s;eemed to give &s;ome energy to her mind, which had &s;unk under the complicated oppre&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> grief, indignation, and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to per&s;uade her, that this cruel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was a mere accident; the young man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ht be engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s for his ma&s;ter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at would not allow him to &s;top.

As I uttered the&s;e

chearing words an unde&s;cribable half-&s;mile fla&s;h|ed like lightning acro&s;s the dark clouds of her expre&s;&s;ive countenance. It was the momentary triumph of fond imagination over &s;ettled &s;adne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Being very de&s;irous to prevent a return of her convul&s;ions, and thinking that a vi&s;it from her lover would mo&s;t effectually &s;ecure her from a relap&s;e, I offered to &s;end for him immediately: but the good girl, with a becoming pride, peti|tioned again&s;t his being &s;ent for; though I could ea&s;ily perceive that her Soul panted for a &s;ight of him. As the evening was now come, I pre|pared to leave her, reque&s;ting that &s;he would be as quiet, and endeavour to get as much &s;leep, as &s;he could in the cour&s;e of the night: and I promi&s;ed to vi&s;it her &s;oon in the morning. She expre&s;&s;ed her obligations to me, with an humble, yet pa&s;&s;ionate gratitude, that affected me much; and the more, as I di&s;cerned an alarming degree of wild inquietude in her features. On my re|turn home, I amu&s;ed my&s;elf with the project of &s;etting the troubled heart of this fair &s;imple mai|den at ea&s;e for life. I charged the di&s;creet Phi|lip to &s;et out by day-break, and conduct this be|loved black&s;mith to me by my early breakfa&s;t-hour, without letting him know the private bu|&s;ine&s;s for which I wanted him. What a charm|ing alacrity does any benevolent project give to the &s;pirits! I had not waked any morning, &s;ince my return, with &s;uch comfortable and chearful &s;en&s;ations, as I felt in ri&s;ing to prepare for the reception of the ru&s;tic &s;tranger. My eager fancy delighted it&s;elf with a vi&s;ion of the great happi|ne&s;s

which I thought my&s;elf about to confer on two de&s;erving creatures, who, though in an humble rank of life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every thing that could render love a &s;ource of happine&s;s to them|&s;elves, and an object of plea&s;ing contemplation to their friends. I expected to &s;ee, in this for|tunate &s;on of Vulcan, a fine image of manly &s;trength, and engaging &s;implicity, corre&s;pond|ing to the feminine graces of his fair admirer. I waited his arrival with great impatience, and anticipated in my thoughts the plea&s;ure I &s;hould have in &s;eeing the bur&s;t of &s;urprize, joy, and gratitude, in the varying features of a young, hone&s;t, open, rural countenance. At length the punctual Philip returned: but what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when he led into my apartment an ill-made, ugly, &s;allow, &s;our-looking fellow, more fa&s;hioned to convul&s;e the heart of beauty with terror, than with love! Half my &s;ympathe|tic warm wi&s;hes for the marriage of poor Jenny, and, I am afraid, half my e&s;teem for the good girl, died away at the fir&s;t glance I ca&s;t on her grim-vi&s;aged &s;wain. But when I recovered a little from my &s;urprize, I began to hope that his under&s;tanding and his fidelity might make us &s;ome amends for the defects of his figure. I talked to him on his good fortune in being &s;o &s;incerely beloved by a charming good girl, and a&s;ked if he had any plan of marrying her very &s;oon. I wi&s;h, my dear Harriot, you could have beheld the half-farcical, half-tragic vi&s;age of the brute, when he replied in his rough dialect&punc; <Q>No, madam, I be'nt &s;uch a fool. There be two wenches in our pari&s;h that I loves better

than &s;he.</Q> I was now &s;eriou&s;ly mortified, for I lo&s;t all hope of accompli&s;hing the little good that I had plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of doing: and I began to think the &s;imple Jane had &s;uffered her&s;elf to be &s;adly overcome by a very gro&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, for which the &s;avage animal before me could furni&s;h us with no decent apolo|gy. But in this idea I did the poor girl much inju&s;tice; for a very &s;ingular and &s;triking inci|dent, that I &s;hall relate to you pre&s;ently, con|vinced me that her pa&s;&s;ion had not only all the &s;trength, but I may &s;ay all the cha&s;tity of ge|nuine love. I re&s;igned all my hopes, and indeed all my wi&s;hes, to form the match I intended! but I was &s;till anxious to re&s;tore the health of the girl. I repre&s;ented to her &s;ullen &s;wain, "that &s;he had been very ill, and that I wi&s;hed him to walk with me to &s;ee her, not for any matri|monial purpo&s;e, but merely to comfort her &s;pi|rits, by the gentle civility of a friend." The&s;e were niceties of behaviour, that the &s;urly Cy|clops did not well comprehend; and he &s;eemed to be alarmed, as if I had propo&s;ed to catch him in a net more &s;ubtile than his old ma&s;ter Vulcan is &s;aid to have contrived on a different occa&s;ion. I thought he would at la&s;t refu&s;e to attend me; but while I was putting on my hat, Philip by ar|gument, or by ale, put his terrors and his per|ver&s;ity to flight; and we &s;et forth all together for the hou&s;e of the dam&s;el. I went fir&s;t alone into her chamber, and found that &s;he had been afflicted with a return of her fits after my de|parture in the preceding evening. Her night had been re&s;tle&s;s; and all her features expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="133" REF="135">
that &s;he had &s;uffered much, not only from the ab&s;ence of &s;leep, but from inquietude of heart. I &s;oon informed her, "that I had been &s;o lucky as to meet with her friend Ned Hew&s;on (for &s;uch is the name given by mortals to this grim &s;on of Vulcan); and that, upon hearing &s;he was not well, he had kindly come with me to enquire after her health." A &s;parkle of fond de|light and gratitude now fla&s;hed from her eyes. She was &s;till in bed; and on my a&s;king her if I &s;hould bring Hew&s;on into her chamber, &s;he re|plied, with a tender tremulous voice, <Q>Yes, if you plea&s;e, Madam.</Q> I now expected to &s;ee the triumph of impa&s;&s;ioned nature over mai|denly, ba&s;hful re&s;erve; I imagined that poor Jane would bur&s;t into a tran&s;port of tears, and cla&s;p her grizly unde&s;erving idol in her arms. Indeed I had &s;ome doubts if propriety would per|mit me to &s;tay, and gratify the curious wi&s;h, which I confe&s;s I felt very &s;trongly to &s;ee the ef|fect of their meeting. Thinking, however, that my medical character was a complete &s;ancti|on for me, I ventured to &s;tay; and am very glad I did &s;o, as I beheld a &s;cene very different from my expectations, and one that re&s;tored to the good girl all that portion of my e&s;teem which I told you &s;he had lo&s;t in the cour&s;e of my reflex|ions on her amour. I called Hew&s;on into her room, and as he approached her bed, &s;he held out her hand to meet his with an air of very mode&s;t affection; then looking tenderly upon him, &s;he replaced her head on the pillow, and, in the &s;pace of a minute, &s;unk into the pro|found and &s;weet &s;leep of an infant. Nothing
<PB N="134" REF="136">
could have &s;urpri&s;ed, nothing could have affected me more; all the language in the world could not &s;o well have expre&s;&s;ed to me how completely I had relieved her poor tortured bo&s;om, by the new and &s;ingular opiate which I had &s;o luckily brought. The very &s;triking contra&s;t between her pre&s;ent deep delicious repo&s;e, and her pa&s;t wild agonies, and wakeful melancholy, led me into a train of reflection on that formidable pa&s;|&s;ion, which has &s;o exten&s;ive and &s;o in&s;tantaneous a power to produce either a tempe&s;t or a calm in the human bo&s;om. While I &s;ate a con&s;iderable time gazing inten&s;ely on the &s;weet &s;leeping countenance of poor Jenny, my eyes were filled with tears of pity for her, and perhaps of ap|prehen&s;ion for my&s;elf. Love &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to be a cruel enemy to us both, and there is in truth very little merit in all my anxious endea|vours to be a friend to this haple&s;s girl; for, as my favourite Zara &s;ays,
<Q><L>I, alas, my&s;elf have been a &s;lave;</L>
<L>And when we pity woes which we have felt,</L>
<L>'Tis but a partial virtue.</L></Q></P>
<P>The ca&s;es, indeed, of poor Jenny and your Cornelia are not preci&s;ely the &s;ame; yet, I tear, we are both de&s;tined to be wretched, from un|fortunate and un&s;ubdued affection. But it is high time to quit this weak digre&s;&s;ion, and pro|ceed in my &s;tory.</P>
<Q><L>Now then, with grief and &s;hame, my Mu&s;e</L>
<L>The &s;equel of her tale pur&s;ues.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137">I had per&s;uaded the half-humanized Ned Hew|&s;on to &s;it down, and wait with me the waking of my fa&s;cinated patient. When we had &s;at about half an hour, we heard a little tumult below &s;tairs, and my companion was called down; as the noi&s;e did not break the &s;ound &s;lumber of Jenny, I &s;at quietly by her, without enquiring into the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance; but the far|mer's wife &s;oon brought me a &s;urpri&s;ing hi&s;tory of the tumultuous adventure: and what, think, you, was the &s;ource of the noi&s;y contention below? Why, truly, it had proceeded from the marvellous attractions and the licentious gal|lantry of my late companion, the hideous Ned Hew&s;on: the pari&s;h officers had arrived in pur|&s;uit of him, and carried him off as their pri&s;oner, and for what? No&mdash;not, as you &s;uppo&s;e, to comfort and re&s;tore the credit of one poor preg|nant weeper&mdash;&mdash;but to make his election of two rival queens in that condition, who, alarmed, I &s;uppo&s;e, by their &s;wain's vi&s;it to me, and the rumour rai&s;ed concerning it, had, in the &s;ame moment, and before the &s;ame magi&s;trate, urged, with great vehemence, their equal claims to this tremendous, Alexander the Black&s;mith.</P>
<P>But I am quite &s;ick of this impudent ugly &s;avage; and, as I dare &s;ay you will be &s;o too, I will di&s;patch as briefly as I can the little re&s;idue of this long &s;tory. As I happened to want a laundry-maid, I prevailed on the farmer's, wife so let me take Jenny immediately in that capa|city. I knew that a change of place would be the be&s;t plan to quiet that angui&s;h of heart which I was convinced the good &s;imple girl
<PB N="136" REF="138">
would feel on the fir&s;t hearing of an event, which I therefore wi&s;hed to communicate to her my&s;elf with a preparatory &s;ermon. When I had &s;ettled her in my own hou&s;e, I informed her, that the perfidious Hew&s;on, as a proper puni&s;h|ment for his various infidelity, was ju&s;t con|demned to matrimonial bondage with a bu&s;tling vixen, who would mo&s;t probably render his fu|ture as turbulent as his pa&s;t life has been licen|tious.</P>
<Q>Some natural tears &s;he dropt, but wip'd them &s;oon.</Q>
<P>And although her features have &s;till the traces of deep melancholy, I hope to re&s;tore her by de|grees to content and chearfulne&s;s: though I know, alas! by experience, that when the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are once lo&s;t, they are not ea&s;ily reco|vered. Thus it is, both in high and low life&mdash;Love leads to folly, either bodily or mental; and folly ends in bitter di&s;quietude, if not in la&s;ting wretchedne&s;s. But your Cornelia is de|termined, if po&s;&s;ible, to grow wi&s;e. Pray en|courage me in this &s;age re&s;olution; and tell me, as I try perpetually to tell my&s;elf that the mo|ther of two lovely heroic boys ought rather to think of playing the part of Minerva, than of a &s;ighing Arcadian &s;hepherde&s;s; e&s;pecially when I &s;ee, in the fate of poor Jenny, how a &s;hepher|de&s;s is rewarded for her &s;ighs. But I am now, in this &s;age humour, ju&s;t going to take my even|ing walk of meditation; adieu, therefore, for to-day, my deare&s;t friend.

<PB N="137" REF="139">
you, a hi&s;tory of a different adventure, in which the tragi-comical confu&s;ion fell chiefly on your devoted Cornelia. It grows late; &s;o, deare&s;t friend of my bo&s;om, good night!</P>
<P>And now, good morning to you, my dear Harriot; I have ju&s;t a&s;&s;igned to my dear litle literary William his morning ta&s;k, which is more a plea&s;ure than a labour to him; and while my &s;weet Liliputian &s;tudent is &s;itting quietly by my &s;ide, more compleatly ab&s;orbed in &s;tudy than many &s;ages of larger growth. I have re&s;umed my pen, to tell you how ludicrou'&s;ly, and yet how painfully, I have been put to the blu&s;h by my whim&s;ical We&s;t-country cou&s;in. Though you have often heard me mention his name, I do not believe that I ever gave you a de&s;cription of this odd mortal, and his &s;ingular manners. If any human crea|ture was ever born under a laughing planet, he is the man. The very contra&s;t between his name and his figure is a perpetual incitement to laughter. Suppo&s;e your&s;elf, my dear Harriot, a very grave and &s;tarched matron, &s;eated in due form to receive my relation on his fir&s;t vi&s;it, could you, do you think, pre&s;erve the gravity of your countenance on hearing your &s;ervant an|nounce <HI>Mr. Small,</HI> and then beholding a huge gigantic mortal &s;ix feet high, and &s;o immode|rately corpulent, that he would &s;plit into a cou|ple of your common theatrical Sir John Fal|&s;taffs? Add to this, that the comical creature, with almo&s;t as much real wit as Sir John, has
<PB N="138" REF="140">
quite as much jocularity of ge&s;ture as an apt. His animal &s;pirits are by no means inferior to his bulk, and you may &s;uppo&s;e therefore that his gaiety, like his figure, borders on the mon|&s;trous; yet it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to be angry with him, let his je&s;ts be ever &s;o ab&s;urd or in&s;ulting. A &s;erious in&s;ult he can never intend. Indeed, I believe it is as little in his power to be &s;erious on any occa&s;ion, as it is to be diminutive. The very affections that give an air of melancholy to other men, have in this creature a very comic expre&s;&s;ion. I believe in my con&s;cience, that, if he was reading the funeral &s;ervice (the mo&s;t &s;olemn of all language) over a decea&s;ed friend that he loved, he would utter it in &s;uch a man|ner, as to make you rather laugh than weep!</P>
<Q>And li&s;t the &s;oul upon a jig to Heaven.</Q>
<P>With &s;uch an exterior of grote&s;que enormity, he has one or the mo&s;t upright, benevolent, and tender hearts in the world; and really performs the actions of a Cato or Ari&s;tides with the fan|ta&s;tic and roguei&s;h grimaces of a Scaramouch.</P>
<P>This very &s;trange being, whom I had not &s;een for three years, entered my dre&s;&s;ing-room the other day, while William and I were read|ing together by our&s;elves. I wi&s;h you could have &s;een the dear boy's look of a&s;toni&s;hment, not &s;o much at the fir&s;t appearance of our gigantic cou&s;in, as at his curious mode of &s;aluting me, which William appeared to be in &s;ome doubt whether he &s;hould applaud or re&s;ent; indeed, it was not very clear, in the fir&s;t moment, whe|ther
<PB N="139" REF="141">
his &s;alutation was that of a friend or a foe. The giant caught me up in his arms exactly as you would take up a little girl of three years old; and fir&s;t &s;winging me round, then gave me a ki&s;s, and &s;aid, "I am come, my fair cou|&s;in, to vi&s;it you for a few hours, ju&s;t to bru&s;h away the cobwebs of &s;olitude and &s;orrow from this pretty little head of yours." He then paid &s;ome fine compliments, between je&s;t and earne&s;t, to my under&s;tanding, and expre&s;&s;ed his great joy at not finding me <HI>in weeds:</HI> "Your widow in weeds, cried he, is the &s;illie&s;t looking animal in the creation; &s;he is like a young Armadillo&mdash; an Armadillo, cou&s;in William, is a pig in ar|mour, that hides every thing but his no&s;e. Should not you laugh to &s;ee &s;uch a droll crea|ture?"&mdash;"Can he fight &s;o?" cried William, with eagerne&s;s and &s;pirit. "No, my brave cousin, replied the Droll; and there lies the be&s;t part of my &s;imile: the pig's armour, in&s;tead of proving a real defence, only invites the merry mi&s;chievous fellows, that catch &s;ight of it, to try if they cannot drive a pin through it."&mdash; At this abominable rate he rattled on for about half an hour; &s;ometimes making me laugh im|moderately, and &s;ometimes di&s;tre&s;&s;ing me almo&s;t to tears. William, by degrees, became very familiar with him, and really made &s;ome very &s;pirited and clever replies to his odd &s;peeches. At la&s;t this half plea&s;ing, half-provoking, and very ponderous je&s;ter, &s;aid to me, "Well, my &s;weet cou&s;in, you mu&s;t not think of moping alone in this noble place; it is high time you &s;hould have &s;ome &s;uch pretty little fairy-like
<PB N="140" REF="142">
fellow as I am, beginning to dance about you like a Jack-o'-Lantern, to enliven the darkne&s;s of widowhood. What a pity it is that my dear, nervous, dainty wife did not take her flight to Paradi&s;e, as &s;he threatened to do when I &s;aw you la&s;t!" I &s;hould tell you, my dear Harri|ot, with all this wild rhodomontade, he is pa&s;|&s;ionately fond of his wife, who is indeed ner|vous in the extreme, and perhaps not the les&s; &s;o for his making a perpetual joke of tho&s;e fine lady-like appearances which her complaint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, more than her natural di&s;po&s;ition of mind, have given to her character. The vi&s;ible languor of her frame is very &s;triking; yet, in &s;pite of that languor, &s;he has contrived to enliven this bois|terous giant with a very numerous family; and &s;ome of its branches, he tells me, are grown a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> riotous and as noi&s;y as him&s;elf. But I return from this digre&s;&s;ion, to the rattling di&s;cour&s;e he was addre&s;&s;ing to me. "What a charming match, cou&s;in, you and I &s;hould have made in that ca&s;e! Hey, my dear William, he continued, catching up the boy in his arms, &s;hould not you like &s;uch a dapper little play-fellow as I am, for your new papa?" William, when he reach|ed the ground again, &s;tared a moment, as if pondering on the que&s;tion; and then &s;aid, with &s;ome drollery of manner, "I do not believe we have a bed in our hou&s;e that is big enough to hold you." "Why, you ungracious rogue, &s;aid the giant, putting on a pretended &s;ternne&s;s of countenance, who &s;hould you like better than me for a papa?" As my evil genius would have it, the little urchin, without being in the lea&s;t
<PB N="141" REF="143">
daunted by the feigned au&s;terity of this demand, in&s;tantly replied, "Mr. Seymour."&mdash;Ah! my dear Harriot, you will ea&s;ily gue&s;s what a coun|tenance I had at the &s;ound of that name, re|peated by my arch cou&s;in, with a mo&s;t &s;ignificant echo, and a whi&s;tle at the end of it, that &s;eem|ed like the view-halloo, which encrea&s;es the joy of the hunter, and the palpitation of poor Pu&s;s. I attempted, in an aukward, embarra&s;&s;ed man|ner, to account for the child's partiality; but my gay vociferous relation &s;oon interrupted me by &s;aying, "Ah! my dear little widow, &s;ay no more!&mdash;&s;ay no more! I &s;ee clearly, by this crim&s;on banner (patting my cheek) what a hap|py conqueror is quartered in the ca&s;tle of your heart&mdash;No! no! not a &s;yllable of prote&s;ta|tion!&mdash;Nay! my good little woman, do not look &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed!&mdash;Upon my &s;oul, I am very glad it is &s;o; I was afraid you might have been fooli&s;hly taught to think it proper to be &s;olemn, and &s;ober, and &s;ad, for a century; which, in your &s;ituation, would be very non|&s;en&s;ical."&mdash;By a deluge of words, half jocular, half tender, and all full of real benevolence, he utterly prevented my giving him a fair ex|planation of my fooli&s;h embarra&s;&s;ment; and he is gone, in the full per&s;ua&s;ion that I am pa&s;&s;ionately in love with Seymour, and determin|ed to marry him. I am &s;uch a &s;impleton as to have been much flurried, and heartily vexed, by this incident, though I have &s;uch perfect confidence both in the honour and di&s;cretion of my rattling; cou&s;in, that I am convinced he will not mention the idea he has conceived to any

Still I am vexed; but I have tried to play the philo&s;opher; and I make at lea&s;t &s;ome u&s;e of my vexation, by giv|ing you &s;uch a full hi&s;tory of it as may, I hope, contribute to your amu&s;ement. Pray tell Lucy, that ob&s;erving how much her charming long let|ters delighted you, I grew jealous of her, and determined to beat her by the length of my &s;crawls, though I cannot rival the brilliancy of her epi&s;tles. When I ca&s;t my eye on the &s;ize of this, it &s;eems to have been written expre&s;sly to make you recant one of your favourite maxims, that a letter can never be too long from a per&s;on you love.

for ever again&s;t the mo&s;t virtuous and mo&s;t tender child that ever triumphed over paternal rage and re&s;entment. In truth, I have had &s;ome fiery trials to endure; and, I flatter my&s;elf, you will applaud me for having &s;u&s;tained them, not only as your confidential friend, but as your affecti|onate and obedient di&s;ciple. I fear I &s;hall give you but a broken irregular narrative of tho&s;e affecting &s;cenes that I would wi&s;h to relate to you very circum&s;tantially; for my nerves, which had not perfectly recovered from the &s;hake they re|ceived in my late illne&s;s, have been &s;o variou&s;ly convul&s;ed in our recent adventures, that I do not &s;eem to have one &s;teady fibre in my frame; and, in the tumult of my pre&s;ent joy, though it is cer|tainly a joy of the cha&s;te&s;t kind, I am more ready to laugh and cry, by fits, like an hy&s;terical wo|man, than to &s;it down and commit to paper a long and methodical relation of tho&s;e events which I am engaged, both by honour and incli|nation, to tell you minutely.</P>
<P>Having collected my thoughts a little, and hav|ing ju&s;t received on the back of my right hand an in&s;piring ki&s;s, accompanied by a tear, from Gi|uliana, who is at this moment in a weeping tran|&s;port of gratitude to you and to all of us, I will en|deavour to accompli&s;h my promi&s;e, and give you with the mo&s;t exact fidelity all the agitating occur|rences of our arrival and reception. Our voyage was plea&s;ant, though not &s;peedy; for we had &s;o little wind, that we were obliged to make conti|nual u&s;e of our oars. One of our laborious crew being di&s;abled by &s;udden illne&s;s, I ventured to amu&s;e my&s;elf by rowing in his place, though the
<PB N="147" REF="149">
poor fellow re&s;igned his oar very reluctantly, and would, I believe, have pulled to his la&s;t ga&s;p if I had not in&s;i&s;ted on relieving him, more for my own amu&s;ement than for his advantage. He told me truly, that I &s;hould find it much harder work than I &s;uppo&s;ed; but you know my pa&s;&s;ion for manly exerci&s;e of all kinds, and how apt my &s;pirit is to give credit to my body for more &s;trength than it has. The tender Giuliana remon&s;trated in vain, by kindly reminding me that my health was far from being confirmed. Man is an ob&s;ti|nate animal, and he is never, I believe, more tempted to over&s;train his force than when a lovely woman be&s;eeches him to &s;pare it. I &s;u&s;tained, however, the ta&s;k I had impo&s;ed on my&s;elf, be|yond the expectation of my companions; though, to confe&s;s the truth, I felt more exhau&s;ted than I would own to them. And I &s;hould not have re|lated to you &s;o trifling an incident, had it not produced a very &s;ingular and happy con&s;equence at a future period, as you will &s;ee in due time; but, as my hi&s;tory is to be conducted with exact order, I have many things to tell you fir&s;t.</P>
<P>As we had the advantage of very &s;erene wea|ther, and an early moon, I contrived, for vari|ous rea&s;ons, not to land in Genoa till after the clo&s;e of day. Our approach to the city, under the &s;oft lu&s;tre of a clear and delicious evening, afforded me one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular and en|chanting views that I ever beheld: I could have pau&s;ed for &s;ome hours, to &s;urvey the placid beauty of this &s;emicircular port, and its rich cre&s;cent of &s;tately palaces, with gardens on the roof of each, had not the heart of Giuliana pre&s;ented to me a
<PB N="148" REF="150">
much more engaging &s;ubject of contemplation. I am, you know, a pa&s;&s;ionate admirer of all pic|ture&s;que &s;cenery; but it is not, I am per&s;uaded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the power of nature to pre&s;ent any pro&s;pect to the eye &s;o perfectly fa&s;cinating as the view of a lovely female heart under &s;trong agitation.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent moonlight voyage very forcibly brought to my thought your moonlight vi&s;it with my companion to the tomb of Peverell. Giuliana was then under the recent impul&s;e of di&s;tracted love and outrageous &s;orrow; yet I que&s;tion if &s;he could feel more at that time than &s;he felt in the fir&s;t moments of her return to her native city. Her anxious de&s;ire to regain the affection of her father, and to become the mini&s;ter of his &s;alvation, has given a tenderne&s;s and a fervor to her &s;pirits beyond every thing that I ever &s;aw in woman. In our pa&s;&s;age from where we landed to the po&s;t-hou&s;e, which is our inn, we had to pa&s;s the hou&s;e of Seignor Pinelli. In cro&s;&s;ing the door of her fa|ther, as &s;he hung upon my arm, I felt a &s;hudder|ing through her frame that affected me like an electric &s;hock; having pa&s;&s;ed the door, &s;he re|vived at every &s;tep, like a per&s;on who has had the courage to cro&s;s an imaginary gho&s;t. I looked back to &s;ee how it was with our little Giannina, who followed us clo&s;e behind; and, affected as I was my&s;elf, I could not forbear laughing to ob|&s;erve the good &s;imple girl, who was at that in|&s;tant before the door of the old Seignor, fortifying her&s;elf by the &s;ign of the cro&s;s. Giannina, I be|lieve, is not more of a Catholic than her mi&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;s; yet &s;o deep does &s;uper&s;tition &s;ink into an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fant mind, that in her pre&s;ent terror &s;he had
<PB N="149" REF="151">
recour&s;e to a ceremony which &s;he had probably determined to relinqui&s;h for ever. But I am dwel|ling too long on petty circum&s;tances. Behold us now &s;afely arrived at our <HI>O&s;teria.</HI> I &s;hut my fe|males into a chamber together, to prevent their being di&s;covered; and engaged my civil ho&s;t in a private conver&s;ation, to collect from him all po&s;|&s;ible information concerning the old Seignor. He behaved, I find, on the elopement of his daughter, as Italians generally do under the in|fluence of re&s;entment, with a peculiar vehemence both of language and conduct. As fiery in his indignation as king Lear, he publicly
<Q><L>di&s;claim'd all his paternal care,</L>
<L>Propinquity and property of blood.</L></Q>
And being anxious to provide him&s;elf with heirs more worthy, in his idea, of the opulence he has to bequeath, "he is now (&s;aid my intelligent informer) on the point of marrying a young widow. Ah, Seignor, added my &s;hrewd ho&s;t, when angry old gentlemen endeavour to puni&s;h their young daughters for a little natural indi&s;cre|tion, they are very apt to play the fool them|&s;elves; and forget that they have not the plea of youth to excu&s;e it." My ho&s;t concluded with many compliments to my countrymen; and gave me to under&s;tand, that if he had him&s;elf a fine daughter, he &s;hould be proud to give her in mar|riage to an Engli&s;h Cavalier, without any &s;cru|ples concerning her body or her &s;oul. As &s;oon as I e&s;caped from my talkative landlord, I ha&s;tened to tell Giuliana the matrimonial news of her fa|ther. She knows the widow perfectly; and &s;aid,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
with great probability, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at if had been actu|ally married to her he mu&s;t have been completely wretched for life. But I am come, &s;he added with a fervency or fillal and religious hope&mdash;I am come, I tru&s;t, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ed hour, to &s;ave him, not only from eternal, but even from temporal infe|licity." How &s;weet and innocent are the&s;e illu|&s;ions of affectionate piety! As far, however, as &s;he projected wedding is concerned, it is proba|ble there may be no illu&s;ion in the ardent hopes of our incomparable Giuliana. But I mu&s;t not anticipate. Let me ob&s;erve, if I can, the due order of time in the long and intere&s;ting hi&s;tory that I have undertaken to give you, with that mi|nutene&s;s to which you are &s;o fully entitled, from all your generous attention to the excellent crea|ture who&s;e adventures and who&s;e feelings you will expect me to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>We talked over various plans for gaining ad|mittance to this offended father. I was half in|clined to &s;horten the anxious and agonizing &s;u&s;|pen&s;e of Giuliana, by tru&s;ting entirely to the force of nature, and to the tender effect which the &s;ight of a returning affectionate child, with|out any preparation, might produce in a paren|tal bo&s;om. But, on mature reflexion, I cho&s;e to adhere very &s;crupulou&s;ly to the conduct you had mo&s;t kindly and very wi&s;ely pre&s;cribed to us. I went alone to the hou&s;e of Seignor Pinelli, taking only a &s;hort billet of &s;upplication from Giuliana, which &s;he dated from England according to your advice; and I re&s;olved, as you recommended, not to let the angry old man &s;u&s;pect that his daughter was returned to Genoa till I had &s;ome|how
<PB N="151" REF="153">
contrived to &s;often his re&s;entment, and to alarm either his affection or his pride with the dread of &s;uch evils as might naturally overtake a de&s;olate young woman in a foreign land.</P>
<P>As I had heard of his giving peremptory orders that no Engli&s;hman &s;hould be &s;uffered to enter his doors, I thought of per&s;onating a French travel|ler; but Giuliana a&s;&s;ured me, I might &s;afely tru&s;t to the kindne&s;s of her father's elderly and chief dome&s;tic, Pietro, for admi&s;&s;ion to a confer|ence, if not with his ma&s;ter, at lea&s;t with him&s;elf. She was perfectly right; the hone&s;t fellow wept like a parent, more than a &s;ervant, in peru&s;ing a &s;crap of paper with three lines, addre&s;&s;ed to him, by the univer&s;ally idolized Giuliana; but in &s;hewing the tenderne&s;s of his own regard for her, he gave me a &s;till &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion of the ob&s;ti|nate anger which had raged without any remi&s;&s;ion in the fiery &s;pirit of her father. He deplored, that, old and attached to her as he was from her infancy, he was not allowed even the privilege of naming his dear mi&s;tre&s;s in the pre&s;ence of her exa&s;perated parent. He &s;poke openly and warm|ly of his ma&s;ter's new and unpromi&s;ing matrimo|nial pro&s;pect; and he expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, that amounted almo&s;t to a re&s;olution, of pur&s;uing the &s;teps of the divine fugitive Giuliana, and dying in her &s;ervice. He laboured to di&s;&s;uade me from the attempt that he conceived to be very painful and fruitle&s;s, to melt the obdurate heart of Pinelli; but as &s;oon as I acquainted him with the death of Peverell, his ideas were totally changed; his anxiety for the de&s;titute Giuliana amounted to agony, and I believe the hone&s;t creature would
<PB N="152" REF="154">
have introduced me to his ma&s;ter had he been &s;ure of being &s;tabbed the next moment for that act of di&s;obedience. We both trembled, I believe, at the in&s;tant of that aweful ceremony; but, as &s;oon as the good Pietro flung open the door of a magnificent library, I advanced with the firme&s;t countenance I could, to &s;alute the maje&s;tic and &s;olitary merchant. He had been reading alone. Repre&s;ent to your&s;elf, my dear Edmund, a very noble figure, arrayed in black; in who&s;e form and features I immediately di&s;covered an engaging, though &s;tern re&s;emblance, to tho&s;e of the beauti|ful Giuliana; a figure exhibiting, to my appre|hen&s;ion, that &s;imple dignity of character which we have frequently admired together in &s;ome quiet portraits of Titian; and had this figure been pre&s;ented to us on canva&s;s, we &s;hould, I think, have gue&s;&s;ed it to be a per&s;on of eminence in a free republic. But this &s;triking appearance of calm grandeur was the vi&s;ion of a moment. The Seignor ro&s;e at my entrance, darting fir&s;t a look of &s;urprize upon me, and then of anger towards Pietro, who rapidly withdrew, to elude the order he expected for conducting me unheard from the apartment in which I had intruded.</P>
<P>I acco&s;ted the merchant, and &s;topped him be|fore he had time to re-open his door. "I am come, Seignor," I exclaimed, "to announce to you the death of a man who has for some time been the object of your ju&s;t indignation! &mdash;a very ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rible accident has put a &s;udden end to the life of Peverell; allow me to hope, that all your anger and all your unhappine&s;s may be buried in his grave." The merchant &s;tood motionle&s;s. His
<PB N="153" REF="155">
pride &s;eemed to contemplate in the event that I announced to him all his injuries avenged by the interpo&s;ition of Heaven; but his native dignity re&s;trained him from bur&s;ting into any indecent exultation. He &s;urveyed me with a gloomy &s;tern|ne&s;s and features that expre&s;&s;ed the unexpected gratification of a dark and imperious pa&s;&s;ion; but he thought it proper to lay, "The life or death of a di&s;tant ruffian are matters of no moment to me: I have only to forget, for my own peace, that &s;uch a villain ever exi&s;ted." "With all my heart," I ha&s;tily replied: "let his exi&s;tence be forgotten: he was no friend of mine. But &s;urely, Seignor, neither you nor I can wi&s;h to forget that you have a mo&s;t lovely daughter, who, though divided from you by the ocean, &s;eems to exi&s;t only in your life; and expre&s;&s;es to you, in this letter, her fond filial wi&s;hes of being re&s;tored for ever to your parental bo&s;om." I here pre&s;ented to him the letter of Giuliana, which he eagerly &s;eized, for no purpo&s;e but that of thru&s;ting it into one of the candles by which he had been reading; and while the paper was blazing in his hand, he &s;aid to me, fiercely, "Let this convince you, young &s;tranger, that I have no longer a child; and trouble me no more with vain petitions from a wanton ungrateful fugitive, again&s;t whom I have clo&s;ed and fortified my heart for ever." This &s;peech was uttered with &s;uch a &s;tedfa&s;t appear|ance of inflexible &s;everity, that I was half petri|fied at the &s;ound of it; but rallying my di&s;mayed &s;pirits to the utmo&s;t of my power, I pur&s;ued my point in the following manner.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156">"You will not think it, Seignor, a very dif|ficult point to free your&s;elf from my intru&s;ion, when I a&s;&s;ure you, with the &s;tricte&s;t truth, that I have no purpo&s;e to an&s;wer in my vi&s;it to you, but the purpo&s;e of pure humanity; that I am led to your hou&s;e, only by compa&s;&s;ion for your angelic unfortunate daughter, and by good will to your|&s;elf." I now perceived that the old man began to li&s;ten to me with milder attention. I derived new &s;pirit from that idea. I launched out into a full, perhaps a vain account, of my own &s;tation in life. I gave him a circum&s;tantial narrative of the &s;ingular, the innocent, the magnanimous conduct, of his child. I &s;poke of you, my d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar Edmund; and you will believe I &s;poke of you with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of friend&s;hip. In &s;hort, I &s;poke &s;o long and &s;o eagerly, that I found my &s;trength fail on a &s;udden, and I was on the point of faint|ing. The old man was affected; with great gent|lene&s;s he placed me on a &s;opha, and called for refre&s;hments. As I imputed my &s;udden languor to what I believe was its real cau&s;e, the fatigue I had fooli&s;hly drawn on my&s;elf by the incident of the oar, Pietro brought in &s;ome very fine fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, with cakes and cordial wine; and the hone&s;t fel|low ca&s;t upon me &s;uch a look of &s;olicitous enquiry, his keen countenance expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a mixture of concern for me, and of hope for his mi&s;tre&s;s, that, half dead as I was, I could hardly help ex|claiming, "Hone&s;t Pietro, we &s;hall triumph at la&s;t!" The merchant him&s;elf, with that &s;in|gular union of dignity and tenderne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in his man|ner which we have &s;o much admired in his daugh|ter, exerted him&s;elf a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly for my relief, yet
<PB N="155" REF="157">
without uttering a &s;yllable that pointed towards a reconciliation with Giuliana. He ob&s;erved, and I believe very truly, that a reclining po&s;ture had &s;aved me from ab&s;olute fainting; and he be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged me not to attempt any further di&s;cour&s;e till the rich wine, who&s;e re&s;torative influence he boa&s;ted, had recruited my exhau&s;ted frame. As the giddi|ne&s;s of my head had been relieved by my po&s;ition, I now felt my&s;elf as &s;trong in mind as I was weak in body; and, as you know, my dear Edmund, how I love to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eize every opportunity of acting with a romantic &s;pirit, you will not be &s;urprized at my re&s;olving to try the influence of this &s;pirit on the dignified merchant. While I &s;till reclined, and he &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od before me with a gla&s;s in his hand, &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ing me to &s;wallow his never-&s;ailing cordial, "Dear Seignor," I exclaimed, "is it po&s;&s;ible that you, &s;o charitable to a &s;tranger, can &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut your heart again&s;t your own angelic daugh|ter! It it is po&s;&s;ible, let me rather expire, from fatigue and emptine&s;s, in your pre&s;ence, than owe my life to a being with a heart &s;o unnatural!" In &s;aying this with a trembling voice, I gently put a&s;ide the gla&s;s that he was pre&s;enting to me. The old man was half provoked and half &s;oftened by my odd behaviour. "I fear," &s;aid he, looking down upon me with a &s;tern and penetrating glance, "you are an ungovernable young man, ra&s;hly wandering from your own parents, and lo&s;ing your &s;en&s;es in a fooli&s;h pa&s;&s;ion for this unworthy girl" On hearing this &s;urmi&s;e, I bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ionate prote&s;tation of my genuine and pure friend&s;hip for Giuliana. I avowed, without naming her, my real attachment and hopes of marriage
<PB N="156" REF="158">
with Cornelia. To convince him of my truth, I offered to relinqui&s;h the immediate pretended object of my travels, which I had told him was to e&s;cort a &s;ickly &s;i&s;ter of mine to a relation we had in Italy; and begged that we might guide him to his daughter in England, and return again all together. The Seignor was greatly touched by the frankne&s;s of this propo&s;al, and &s;aid, with an air of mild deliberation, "What|ever your de&s;igns may be, you are a very extraor|dinary and intere&s;ting vi&s;itor: if I have wronged you by my &s;u&s;picions, I a&s;k your pardon, and I entreat you no longer to reject the cordial for which you have &s;uch vi&s;ible occa&s;ion." As he held one hand towards me with the wine, I &s;eized the other, and ki&s;&s;ing it, replied, "I have, in|deed, my dear Seignor, occa&s;ion for your kind|ne&s;s; but would you &s;hew it mo&s;t effectually for my relief, drink your&s;elf the gla&s;s you offer me&mdash; drink it to the health and happy return of your child&mdash;I will pledge you with my whole &s;oul, and, in&s;tead of declining your favours, will then ble&s;s you with tears of gratitude for your generous ho&s;|pitality." My tears, however, would not wait for this appointed moment; they gu&s;hed as I &s;poke, upon the hand of the merchant.</P>
<P>"There is no contending with you," &s;aid the half-melted father, and pouring out a &s;econd gla&s;s for me, he complied with my intreaty, by drink|ing the fir&s;t, yet he could not preva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l on his lips to utter the name of Giuliana, or to expre&s;s even a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h for her return; he only &s;aid to me, in a &s;ort of murmur, "May the penitent you plead for de&s;erve &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a friend!" "She

de&s;erves the friend&s;hip of earth and heaven," &s;aid I, &s;tarting up in a tran&s;port of exultation at hav|ing &s;ucceeded &s;o far, and venting the fulne&s;s of my heart in the mo&s;t fervent vow for the affecti|onate re-union of a child and parent &s;o worthy of each other, and &s;o unhappily divided. I at la&s;t eagerly &s;wallowed the <HI>Lacryma Chri&s;ti</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A wine &s;o called.</NOTE>, which my courteous ho&s;t had so repeatedly recommend|ed as the be&s;t of re&s;toratives; my &s;tomach, in|deed, acknowledged the excellence of his cordial; but my heart and &s;oul felt a &s;till warmer and more delightful effect, from my pro&s;pect of bending him to my wi&s;hes. He filled my gla&s;s again, and, to animate me &s;till farther, drank him&s;elf, in a very friendly manner, to my perfect recovery. His generous wine &s;eemed to operate as happily towards opening his own heart, as it did in re|lieving the languor of my frame: yet, ob&s;erving how much he laboured to wave all di&s;cour&s;e on his daughter; I thought it be&s;t for me to gain, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome portion of his e&s;teem, by talking on other topics, before I pre&s;&s;ed him again on that point. I had &s;tudied the peculiarities of his character, and now endeavoured to turn them to my advantage. How adroit are we made by any pa&s;&s;ionate and benevolent de&s;ire! Of all talents in the world I have the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to the talent of flattery; yet I contrived to flatter the penetrating merchant very &s;ucce&s;sfully, on his republican dignity, on the &s;pirit of his ance&s;tors, who defended his native city from the tyranny of France, on the native and improved vigour of his mind, in de&s;pi&s;ing, not only the gro&s;s &s;uper&s;ti|tions of his country, but every &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;ti|tion.

Here you know, my dear Edmund, I was galloping on my favourite ground: the &s;ub|ject, and the delightful end that I hoped to gain by introducing it, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the potent wine I had drank, in&s;pired me, I believe, with unu&s;ual eloquence; for the old merchant, while I kept clear of his daughter, appeared to &s;ympathi&s;e with me in every &s;entiment. The more I talked to him, the more he &s;eemed to covet my acquaint|ance; and at la&s;t I flattered him into &s;uch a vein of good humour, that he in&s;i&s;ted on my making his hou&s;e my home while I &s;tayed in Genoa. This offer was the great object of my ambition; and I thought my&s;elf a mo&s;t capital politician in having obtained it; but, in&s;tead of replying to it by a profu&s;ion of thanks and &s;cruples, I exclaimed, "No, my good Seignor, I mu&s;t not tru&s;t my&s;elf with &s;uch an enchanting companion; for you have already made me forget, not only my own infirmities, but tho&s;e of my poor &s;i&s;ter, who is now waiting for me at your po&s;t-hou&s;e; and if I &s;tay any longer, the poor terrified girl will con|clude that I have been robbed and murdered in your &s;treets." In &s;aying this, I prepared to take my leave for the night. The courteous Pinelli in&s;i&s;ted on paying his re&s;pects to the lady, and conveying her from an hou&s;e &s;o unfit for a female invalid, to his own comfortable man&s;ion. His carriage was ordered for this purpo&s;e. With &s;ome difficulty I prevailed on the polite old man to let me be his amba&s;&s;ador, on an ab&s;olute promi&s;e of returning to him, with my &s;i&s;ter and all our &s;er|vants, in the cour&s;e of the evening. I was now in &s;uch an agitation of triumph, and impatience
<PB N="159" REF="161">
to relieve the &s;u&s;pen&s;e of Giuliana, that I could not wait for the carriage; but, de&s;iring that it might follow me, I flew to relea&s;e my dear anxious pri&s;oner, and ble&s;s her with the tidings of my &s;uc|ce&s;s. Her joy was great, but &s;till tempered with apprehen&s;ion, as I had too frankly told her all that hone&s;t Pietro &s;aid of her father's implacability. She was afraid that his quick &s;pirit would catch fire on the di&s;covery of deception, and that, in|&s;tead of giving us a cordial welcome as I pre&s;um|ed, be would &s;purn us from his door. I was not, in deed, perfectly free from fear my&s;elf on this point; but I endeavoured to &s;trengthen the hopes of Giu|liana. "O, &s;aid the divine creature, all I mean is to prepare you with patience to endure calmly any &s;udden bur&s;t of his re&s;entment: as to my&s;elf, it is my duty to &s;uffer, and to embrace all the in|dignities that can be put upon me; and what would I not mo&s;t chearfully undergo to regain his affections, and to lead him by degrees to a wor|thier &s;en&s;e of his God!" Such was the devout enthu&s;ia&s;m of this incomparable daughter. She had no fears for her&s;elf, but all for me and her fa|ther, because &s;he thought that in our tempers we are both precipitate, and equally de&s;titute of re|ligious regulation.</P>
<P>While &s;he was giving me a divine lecture, her father's carriage arrived; her heart fluttered at the &s;ound of it. Having muffled up both her face and Giannina's, with a charge not to di&s;cover them&s;elves till they were at the feet of the vene|rable Seignor, I thru&s;t them ha&s;tily into the carri|age, and we were rapidly driven to his door.

I never endured, in my life, an in&s;tant of &s;uch pain. But Nature &s;oon declared her&s;elf our con|federate: the old man had not power to per&s;i&s;t in his proud indignation, and catching up his lovely &s;uppliant child, he bur&s;t into tears, and pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om. I wept as plentifully, and had as little power of &s;peaking; but my heart &s;houted, <HI>Victoria!</HI> and &s;eizing the little Giannina in my arms, I ran off with her, to reward the good &s;oul of Pietro, who was &s;tanding in a trance of awe|ful amazement on the outer &s;ide of the half-open door. The hone&s;t old dome&s;tic was frantic with joy when I &s;portively threw the returned little fu|gitive into his arms. After receiving a million of his rapid benedictions, I ventured to return to a &s;cene &s;till more intere&s;ting and more delightful, which I had quitted chiefly from a de&s;ire of paying the mo&s;t delicate re&s;pect to the &s;anctity of paren|tal emotions.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">As &s;oon as I appeared again in the pre&s;ence of the relenting father, Giuliana quitted his hand, and advancing towards me with a cha&s;te familia|rity and tenderne&s;s, which you who know her, and you only, can perfectly conceive, &s;he embraced me, and exclaimed, "My guide, my brother!

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. FROM MISS AUDLEY TO MRS. AUDLEY. [&s;ent with the preceding letter from Seymour.]</HEAD>
<P>READ, read, and rejoice, my good Har|riot! Thanks to the cha&s;te &s;tars! and double thanks to the virtue and kindne&s;s of our &s;pirited and excellent young traveller! I am ena|bled to make the very return I mo&s;t wi&s;hed to your friendly and delightful communication, in re&s;toring to you that enchanting picture which our dear frank Cornelia has given you of her own feeling heart. How happy am I to join her intere&s;ting pages to pages not le&s;s intere&s;ting, from a hand that will now, I tru&s;t, in due time, be mo&s;t happily and holily joined to hers.</P>
<P>How will her lovely quick eyes devour the hi&s;|tory I &s;end you! Methinks I &s;ee all her doubts, her terrors, her &s;cruples, her re&s;olutions, melt away as &s;he advances in the peru&s;al. Our bene|volent Edmund is tran&s;ported with the conduct and &s;ucce&s;s of his young amba&s;&s;ador; and pro|nounces him fairly entitled to paradi&s;e, from his various merits in this arduous trial: the paradi&s;e we mean is, the heart of your Cornelia; of which we call you the Saint Peter: we be&s;eech you, therefore, fair &s;aint, to throw open the
<PB N="164" REF="166">
ble&s;&s;ed gate over which you pre&s;ide, and &s;ecure free admi&s;&s;ion to this meritorious a&s;pirer.</P>
<P>In &s;ober &s;erious truth, my dear Harriot, we entreat you to make the mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent glo|rious opportunity, to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t of this engaging Seymour; not only in the heart of Cornelia, where Love and Nature, I fancy will &s;ufficiently befriend him, but in the le&s;s &s;oft, though amiable mind, of your excellent hu&s;|band.</P>
<P>Ah, my dear Harriot, I cannot conceal from you the dread that torments me in the mid&s;t of our joy. Do not, with the u&s;ual weakne&s;s of a wife, betray me to my brother; to who&s;e endea|ring virtues be a&s;&s;ured that my heart does full ju&s;tice, while I tremble for the po&s;&s;ible con&s;e|quence of his inflexible integrity: you will un|der&s;tand what I mean. Believe me, my dear &s;i&s;ter, we have both of us a thou&s;and rea&s;ons for the mo&s;t tender caution on this very delicate point.</P>
<P>Should your hu&s;band now oppo&s;e the union of Seymour and Cornelia, from any motives of re|ligious apprehen&s;ion, farewell, not only to the future happine&s;s of that intere&s;ting and deeply enamoured pair; but farewell to that &s;weet peace and harmonious affection which has long pre|vailed, so uncommonly, and &s;o delightfully, among the different branches of our hou&s;e. I can perceive already, that all the boa&s;ted philo|&s;ophy, of our tranquil Edmund will not be &s;uffi|cient to prevent his pride from re&s;enting any op|po&s;ition of the kind I have mentioned again&s;t the

young friend to whom his heart is now acknow|ledging its recent and indelible obligation.</P>
<P>A word to the wi&s;e, though it comes from an affectionate &s;impleton, may be of &s;ome u&s;e; for|give me, therefore, my dear Harriot, if there is folly, as I &s;u&s;pect there is, in the gloomine&s;s of my fears; and continue to love me for the warmth and &s;incerity of my affection.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. FROM MRS. AUDLEY; [in an&s;wer to the preceding.]</HEAD>
<P>FORGIVE you, my dear tender-hearted mo|nitor! a&s;k not forgivene&s;s when you de|&s;erve the fonde&s;t thanks. I have reproached my&s;elf a thou&s;and times for the idle words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dropt in our ha&s;ty interview, when I confided to you the charming pacquet of our Cornelia. Your benevolent &s;pirit has, I find by the anxious kindne&s;s of your letter this moment received, dwelt very &s;eriou&s;ly on tho&s;e idle words. After I ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e you farewell, I was apprehen&s;ive that you might do &s;o; your good-nature, which is natu|rally alive and &s;olicitous for your friends, has ac|quired, from the &s;ingular incidents of your life, a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culiar degree of timidity, where the happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="166" REF="168">
of tho&s;e you love is concerned. From this, my dear girl, and from my fooli&s;h je&s;t, by which I have added to the accidental bent of your ten|der mind, you have harboured an idea very painful to your own friendly bo&s;om; and allow me to &s;ay, a little injurious to a certain <HI>unblame|able</HI> creature, to whom, among other infinite obligations, I owe the great plea&s;ure I feel in giving and receiving from you the name and affection of a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Now do not &s;ay "No;" nor think, my dear Lucy, that I am talking to you with the "u&s;ual weakne&s;s of a wife," who cannot endure, even a &s;yllable, that does but &s;eem to find fault with her good man.</P>
<P>You charge me not to <HI>betray</HI> you to your bro|ther, but, my good girl, what room is there for any &s;pecies of <HI>treachery</HI> between parties who have, in truth, nething to hide, as they have no de&s;igns or &s;en&s;ations towards each other but tho&s;e of reciprocal affection? However, to shew you that I am rather the loyal subject, than the abject &s;lave, of my hu&s;band, I &s;hall ob&s;erve your in|junction, and not impart to him your letter; though, believe me, all the effect it could have upon him would be (if that effect were po&s;&s;ible) to increa&s;e his affection for you. Let me now a&s;&s;ure you, mo&s;t &s;olemnly, that in the main ob|ject o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your apprehen&s;ion there is nothing to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eared from our dear indulgent Audley. To con|vince you of my perfect &s;incerity on this point, I will frankly &s;ay to you, that, if my good father &s;tood in the po&s;t of my hu&s;band, as Cornelia's tru&s;tee, I &s;hould indeed be terrified for the de&s;tiny
<PB N="167" REF="169">
of the <HI>Lovers!</HI> aye <HI>Lovers!</HI> my dear, I will not mince the matter: Lovers they are, as we well know, in reality, though not yet declared &s;o in form. But though I que&s;tion if ever nymph and &s;wain were more pa&s;&s;ionately enamoured, or, in mo&s;t points, more &s;uited to each other; if my good father, as I was &s;aying, had the guardian|&s;hip of the lady; the rigorous &s;pirit of his reli|gion would attempt, I know, and I dare &s;ay with &s;ucce&s;s, to annihilate the match. The piety of <HI>my pre&s;ent,</HI> and, I may &s;ay to you, my <HI>better Lord</HI> (though I really love my father), is made of much gentler, and more tolerant principles. From my parents I learnt all the practices of de|votion; but it is from your brother alone, my dear Lucy, that I have learnt, I think, the true e&s;&s;ence of religion. What is there that I might not learn from him, except what his tenderne&s;s would &s;ometimes wi&s;h to teach me, becau&s;e he thinks, and I fear truly that I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for it? Alas, mu&s;t I ever learn that bittere&s;t of le&s;&s;ons, how to bear his lo&s;s!</P>
<P>But I am fallen imperceptibly, into a tender melancholy, ill-&s;uited to the time, and very dif|ferent from the &s;train in which I meant to fa&s;hion my infant reply to your affectionate letter. Hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly for us both, here are objects ju&s;t here appear|ing in my &s;ight to give a livelier turn to my thoughts: I can ju&s;t di&s;cern the graceful figure of Cornelia, on hor&s;eback, at this moment ap|proaching your favourite clump of trees.

<P>Well, that little &s;crupulous half-yielded and half-defended heart &s;hall be &s;peedily thrown into new palpitations. Audley has met her, and is walking home by her &s;ide. I mu&s;t put away my paper for the pre&s;ent, my dear Lucy; but before I clo&s;e it, you &s;hall have, what I know you ar|dently wi&s;h to have, a full hi&s;tory of the impre&s;|&s;ion which the long and touching narrative of Seymour may make on tho&s;e to whom I now pant to impart it. Adieu for to day.</P>
<P>LET me now re-echo to you your own lively words, "Read! read! and rejoice, my dear Lucy!" Tru&s;t me, the intere&s;t of your young and powerful client is &s;trengthened as much as you can wi&s;h in the two aweful courts of Love and Friend&s;hip.

&s;kim it imperfectly, we will &s;ecure our&s;elves from interruption, and my dear Audley will have the goodne&s;s to read it to us aloud." Cornelia gave me a look that &s;eemed to &s;ay, "Oh, you barba|rous creature, why would not you indulge me with it alone!" but joyous curio&s;ity &s;oon tri|umphed over her momentary di&s;plea&s;ure. We prepared to li&s;ten with all our ears; and my good man entered with his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s on the plea&s;ant ta&s;k I a&s;&s;igned to him. He read with great &s;pirit the hone&s;t exultation at the opening of the letter, and not without remark|ing the graceful mode&s;ty of Seymour. "You will readily &s;uppo&s;e, that I watched every in&s;tant the features of both my companions; their fir&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion was that of &s;imple, unmixed joy, in the perfect &s;ucce&s;s of this charitable emba&s;&s;y.

I mu&s;t not attempt to give you a very minute account of the&s;e, as they would render my letter more voluminous than Seymour's; but there were two or three &s;triking incidents, in the cour&s;e of this reading, that I mu&s;t de&s;cribe to you. When Audley came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;&s;age, <Q>It is not, I am per&s;uaded, in the power of nature to pre&s;ent any pro&s;pect to the eye &s;o perfectly fa&s;cinating as the view of a lovely female heart under &s;trong agitation,</Q> he fixed his arch eyes on our lovely gue&s;t, who, &s;en&s;ible of his meaning, turned in&s;tantly, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ale with terror, my dear, but <HI>crim&s;on, deep crim|&s;on,</HI> with con&s;cious love. AudIey gave me a &s;ignificant glance; and, to relieve our dear di&s;|tre&s;t
<PB N="170" REF="172">
friend, began to read on, without farther pau&s;e. The de&s;cription of the little Giannina pa&s;&s;ing the old merchant's door made us all &s;mile; but when my dear devout hu&s;band read the fol|lowing exclamation, <Q>How &s;weet and innocent are the illu&s;ions of affectionate piety!</Q> he ex|claimed, with an expre&s;&s;ion of countenance be|tween a frown and a &s;mile, "Ah, Seymour, we mu&s;t &s;omehow convince you, that true piety is &s;o far from being full of illu&s;ions as you &s;uppo&s;e it, that it is the only thing which can &s;eparate illu&s;ion from human joy." He added, with an air of cordial friend&s;hip, "if we can but teach you this &s;imple truth, we &s;hall very ea&s;ily make you one of the happie&s;t, as you are certainly one of the mo&s;t amiable men in the world." Another full blu&s;h, and a half &s;igh, here e&s;caped from Cornelia. Audley read on, very generou&s;ly, without ca&s;ting his eyes towards her. When he came to Seymour's &s;udden languor, and affect|ing di&s;cour&s;e to the old merchant before he would accept his cordial, Cornelia and I bur&s;t into tears that we tried in vain to check. Your brother, who is, you know, by nature u&s;ed to the melting mood, &s;oon completed the weeping party: he read and wept, and wept and read, till at la&s;t, &s;eizing the tran&s;ported Cornelia by the hand, he exclaimed, "By heaven, my dear widow, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to love this bewitch|ing Seymour! The rogue has melted me into a woman, and made me in love with him my&s;elf."</P>
<P>There, my dear Lucy, there's a charming &s;pecific for your fits of timidity. Now have I a great mind to throw down my pen, and leave

to dwell on tho&s;e comfortable words; yet I will not be &s;o cruel to you as to &s;uppre&s;s one cir|cum&s;tance, which, as my dear Audley &s;aid to me when we were alone, di&s;played to him at once the native mode&s;ty of Cornelia, and her rooted pa&s;&s;ion for Seymour: when my hu&s;band read the words, "my adored Cornelia," &s;he did not, as I maliciou&s;ly expected, &s;tart &s;uddenly or blu&s;h at the &s;ound of her own name &s;o tenderly introduced. In truth, &s;he did not believe tho&s;e words exi&s;ted in the letter. Pray admire this diffidence in our lovely friend As Audley had rallied her a little on her &s;uppo&s;ed affection, &s;he concluded, in the &s;implicity of her heart, that he had &s;portively in&s;erted this pa&s;&s;age as a conti|nuation of his ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llery; and &s;he laughed at him, in her turn, for &s;uppo&s;ing her &s;o credulous. On his prote&s;ting his veracity, and placing before her eye the identical words, "my adored Cornelia," written in fair and large characters, her tears fell in&s;tantaneou&s;ly on the paper: I could not re&s;train my&s;elf from giving a voice to them, and ex|claiming, in the words of the &s;carcely le&s;s &s;im|ple, and certainly not more enamoured Mi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anda,

<P>As &s;oon as I had pronounced my wicked quo|tation, I was ready to bite my tongue off, for my poor friend was bitterly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and ca&s;t upon me an eye of heart-wounding reproach; but your brother, who is, you know, the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">exterous of beings in relieving the embarra&s;&s;ed,

In truth, Giu|liana now appears to me &s;o much the angel, that I &s;hould almo&s;t call it profanene&s;s in any man to think of making her even a wife. She is&mdash;I do not mean to &s;peak with any fooli&s;h jocularity, but in &s;erious verity&mdash;&s;he is too &s;piritual for &s;uch a department: all the warm and half-wanton <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lood; all the little amiable caprices which form, you know, the attractive e&s;&s;ence of female cha|racter in a young mode&s;t woman; all the&s;e, that mu&s;t have exi&s;ted in the frame of Giuliana, &s;eem to be refined into &s;oul, into mere intellectual be|nevolence. The fact, I am per&s;uaded, is that all her faculties, and &s;en&s;ations are ab&s;orbed in her sublime and eternal pa&s;&s;ion for Peverell; it is the ambition of her heart and &s;pirit to be unit|ed to that dear idol in paradi&s;e; and her tempe|rate enthu&s;ia&s;m per&s;uades her, that &s;he will mo&s;t

effectually accompli&s;h this great object, by mi|ni&s;tering to the temporal and to the coele&s;tial intere&s;t of her father: whether &s;he will &s;ucceed or not, in rai&s;ing the old merchant to Heaven, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to determine; but I may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that &s;he has re&s;cued him from that earthly Tartarus, an ill-a&s;&s;orted marriage. I have now pa&s;&s;ed eight very intere&s;ting and rapid days in their hou&s;e; it is utterly beyond my power to de&s;cribe to you the exqui&s;ite addre&s;s, delicacy, and &s;pirit, with which &s;he has carried many im|portant points in this period: I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with giving you the re&s;ult of her influ|ence. In the fir&s;t place, &s;he has acquired, and exerci&s;ed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and becoming gentlene&s;s, that a&s;cendancy and dominion over the impetu|ous old man, which a pure &s;pirit has over a per|ver&s;e one; &s;he has di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entangled him, in the mo&s;t graceful manner, from his matrimonial perplexity; not by any abrupt oppo&s;ition to the projected m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tch, but by teaching him to marry, as our militia-men fight, by a &s;ub&s;titute. It for|tunately happened, that a young di&s;tant relation of Seignor P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nelli was more enamoured than him&s;elf of this captivating and formidable widow. Giuliana, with inexpre&s;&s;ible dexterity, per&s;uaded her embarra&s;&s;ed father to become an advocate for the &s;tronger and more &s;ea&s;onable pa&s;&s;ion of his young kin&s;man; and to to&s;s a little of his own &s;uperflous gold into the &s;cale of his rival, which he wi&s;hed to preponderate again&s;t him&s;elf. By this &s;ingular alliance, between Plutus and Cupid, the arduous affair has been happily &s;ettled, in a manner to accommodate all parties. I have &s;till
<PB N="175" REF="177">
to relate to you another delightful in&s;tance of Giuliana's conciliating addre&s;s and di&s;intere&s;ted magnanimity. She has negotiated and conclud|ed a peace between &s;ome di&s;cordant branches of her father's family. She has even introduced into his hou&s;e, as his adopted &s;on, a very pro|po&s;ing and accompli&s;hed young man, the child of his &s;i&s;ter, who, having married to di&s;oblige the high-&s;pirited Pinelli, had experienced his re|&s;entment in such a degree, that he not only lived for many years without any intercour&s;e with her con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, but ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnantly rejected her over|tures of reconciliation on the death of her hu&s;|band, an event that happened while Giuliana was in England. Such have been the dome&s;tic employments of our divine friend &s;ince her re|turn; you will ea&s;ily conceive how I wor&s;hip her, and without any breach of my very different de|votion to my no le&s;s adored, and &s;till more at|tractive, Cornelia, who, even in the&s;e bu&s;y days, when I have been honourable employed as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nfidant of age and youth, of the father and his child, has not unfrequently been a &s;ubject of our animated conver&s;ation. Giuliana, in the mid&s;t of arduous and intricate bu&s;ine&s;s, has the happy talent of attending, not only to her pre|&s;ent, but even to her mo&s;t di&s;tant friends. You and Lucy will receive, with this letter, &s;everal very plea&s;ing proofs of her grateful remembrance. But you, as I have ju&s;t told her, will join with me in reproving the &s;umptuous liberality of her gratitude. We have had a vehement conte&s;t in a point of delicacy and honour, in which &s;he has &s;ubdued me completely both in words and

actions. In truth, &s;he invaded me on my weak &s;ide, and therefore obtained a more rapid and deci&s;ive victory. What think you &s;he has in&s;i&s;t|ed on doing? Would you believe that &s;he has, in a great mea&s;ure, taken from me the dear office of &s;upplying the mu&s;ical wants of my Cor|nelia? She will only allow me to &s;end, on my own account, two favourite airs; while &s;he u&s;urps the prerogative of di&s;patching, as a pre|&s;ent from her&s;elf to the lovely &s;tranger, an ex|qui&s;ite &s;election of vocal mu&s;ic. I argued very furiou&s;ly again&s;t the glaring impropriety, and I added the barbarity, of &s;uch a proceeding. But my more eloquent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntagoni&s;t &s;oon convinced my love, of not my rea&s;on, that the terms of re|proach, which I applied to her de&s;ign, were in truth only applicable to the oppo&s;ition I made to it.</P>
<P>What a &s;ublime creature &s;he is!&mdash;how impe|rious in her humility!&mdash;She has written a letter to Cornelia.

of your delightful narrative; and though we have twice read it regularly through together, Lucy and I are almo&s;t ready to quarrel for the &s;eparate &s;heets that each is eager to devour alone.</P>
<P>Tell the noble Seignor and our divine Giuli|ana, that, &s;eparated as we are by the ocean, we &s;ee, we hear, we embrace you all every day; and take a full &s;hare in tho&s;e &s;cenes of heart-felt delight, which have ari&s;en &s;o happily, my dear Seymour, from the admirable exertion of your talents and virtues. I &s;ee how ardently the grateful, the angelic Giuliana will wi&s;h you to be rewarded: I de&s;ire therefore that you will tell her, in a whi&s;per, a piece of private intelligence, that I am &s;ure will add very con&s;iderably to her pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction &mdash;tell her, we have already a reward for you equal to her generous e&s;timate of your merits; yes, you happy and meritorious favourite of the fair, you will allow that I have not exaggerated the value of this reward when I be&s;towed it upon you <HI>in a word,</HI> and a&s;&s;ure you, from indi&s;putable authority, that your adored Cornelia <HI>doats</HI> upon her adorer. Nay, doubt it a little if you plea&s;e; &s;o much the better; le&s;t the exce&s;s of your joy, con&s;pir|ing with the native impetuo&s;ity of your &s;pirit, &s;hould render you ab&s;olutely frantic; yet it is an hone&s;t truth that my gratitude in the pre&s;ent hour could not withhold from you, though I con|fe&s;s my di&s;cretion, or, as you will call it, my timidity, &s;ugge&s;ted to me &s;ome rea&s;ons again&s;t indulging you completely with &s;o important a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>I now behold you ready to a&s;k me a thou&s;and que&s;tions in a moment. Patience, dear ardent
<PB N="181" REF="183">
inamorato, you &s;hall know all; you &s;hall be told, that the feeling, the frank, the generous Cor|nelia, has owned a pa&s;&s;ion for you to the friend of her bo&s;om, the compa&s;&s;ionate Harriot; from whom the precious &s;ecret travelled, through your very zealous advocate Lucy, to me. To &s;hew you how completely I command this plea&s;ant channel of intelligence, I &s;hall let you know that I have &s;een, and that I admire, your letter to Cornelia. You have ingeniou&s;ly contrived to make violent love to her without &s;aying a &s;ylla|ble on the &s;ubject. Indeed I greatly approve your caution and delicacy: I did not ob&s;erve a word that Prudence her&s;elf in the weeds of a widow, could po&s;&s;ibly carp at. Your unaffected Cornelia &s;ent a copy of your letter to her confi|dante, with an hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion of the delight &s;he received from it: yet the dear dainty creature is re&s;olved not to marry: no; you are too wicked, magnanimous and engaging as you are; and all other men are out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But &s;eriou&s;ly, my deare&s;t Seymour, you mu&s;t be very guarded in your behaviour; her heart and &s;oul are your own, if you will but avail your&s;elf with prudence of the victory you have gained.</P>
<P>As I &s;end you &s;uch intelligence as will, I know, occa&s;ion a wild ferment in your veins, let me cool them with a little icy admonition: Fir&s;t, I advi&s;e, nay, conjure you, to remain, as we wi&s;ely &s;ettled for you, the whole winter in Italy. Secondly, be cautious, I be&s;eech you, in your conduct there. Beware of all the wild frolicks to which your runaway &s;pirits are &s;o apt
<PB N="182" REF="184">
to betray you. Do not poi&s;on your blood by any gallant compliance with the wi&s;hes of an Italian prince&s;s; and pray, when you are at Rome, let not your flaming abhorrence of &s;uper&s;tition ex|cite you to kick the whole College of Cardinals out of the imperial city, or to &s;acrifice the poor Pope him&s;elf to the manes of your favourite Brutus.</P>
<P>It is hardly fair in me, recently and inexpre&s;|&s;ibly indebted as I am to your ardent virtues, thus to rally you for that impetuo&s;ity of &s;pirit who&s;e exce&s;&s;es I apprehend; but you will read my love in my fears, and my fears in my raillery.</P>
<P>I have yet a million of things to &s;ay; but I write at pre&s;ent in extreme ha&s;te, to &s;eize an un|expected opportunity of &s;ending this to you by a private conveyance. Perhaps my &s;econd letter may reach you before the fir&s;t, which had nearly happened in the arrival of your two enchanting packets from Genoa, as they came to me within a few hours of each other. I would not begin writing to you in return, till I could tell you how graciou&s;ly your delicate <HI>love-letter</HI> in <HI>dumb &s;hew</HI> had been received by your dainty idol; be|cau&s;e I knew that a letter which failed to tell you this mu&s;t be of little or no value to &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate a lover.

My brother (as well as Lucy and Harriot) is warmly your friend. How can &s;uch a hero fail, &s;upported by &s;uch confederates? In &s;hort, you have not an enemy to encounter.

Ah, Love, Love, what havoc do&s;t thou make in the memory, &s;en|&s;es, judgment, and all the bodily particles, that form the compo&s;ition of that poor weak creature called a woman! But, dear Mr. Philo&s;opher, do not grow too proud in your &s;olitude while you read this reflexion; for you know, by woeful experience, the ca&s;e is not much better with you imperious lords of the creation. How often has your own magi&s;terial rea&s;on, when guarded and graced by an orderly train of arguments and re&s;olutions, like a &s;et of important con&s;tables at|tending the Lord Mayor; how often, I &s;ay, has this ma&s;culine rea&s;on of yours, with all its re|tinue, been reduced to di&s;appear, like a poor &s;kulking magi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate in the tumults and conflagra|tion of the metropolis!

<P>Fir&s;t, let me tell you, as you have not been here for &s;ome years, that this charming &s;pot is a thou&s;and times more beautiful than it was when we paid a vi&s;it together to our poor departed relation.

<P>What a wicked and abominable &s;imile is this! Heaven grant the gho&s;t of my old cou&s;in may not torment me for it! but it &s;truck my fancy &s;o forcibly, that I could not help throwing it into my letter, to make you &s;mile in your &s;olitude.</P>
<P>But to return to my own hi&s;tory: my brother and Harriot e&s;corted me hither on Thur&s;day, by their new private road, which really &s;aves a cir|cuit of about 17 miles; and, notwith&s;tanding all that Harriot has repeatedly &s;aid in its prai&s;e, it &s;urprized and delig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted me beyond my expec|tation.

And the&s;e two charitable landlords &s;eem to have had an amicable conten|tion which &s;hould produce the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and perfect &s;pecimens of ru&s;tic comfort, content, and chearfulne&s;s.

<P><PB N="187" REF="189">Harriot, who is, you know, &s;uch a rare good wife as to delight more in a tribute paid to the benevolence of her hu&s;band, than in any com|pliments to her own beauty or under&s;tanding, was gratified in the extreme, by the cordial admiration I expre&s;&s;ed for this enchanting road, which I begged leave to chri&s;ten by the name of <HI>Jacob's Ladder,</HI> as it &s;eems to lead ultimately to Heaven, and its &s;teps are covered with little cherubims.

The day was a plea&s;ant one in all points, except in their &s;peedy return.

<P>WELL, my dear inamorato, one of your pa&s;&s;ionate prayers is compleatly accom|pli&s;hed. Never was my poor friend Peverell, living or dead, more vehemently idolized by the ardent G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uliana than you are by the timid, the tender, the melting, Cornelia! 'Tis &s;o, by all the powers of Love, if I know any thing of woman's heart, which I have &s;tudied in truth with &s;ufficient application more years than you have. Your good friend the penetrating and zealous Lucy has furni&s;hed me with a hundred proofs, which you would have patience, I &s;up|po&s;e, to peru&s;e, if they were &s;et forth in a fo|lio volume, notwith&s;tanding your di&s;like to a book of that &s;ize; but as I pre&s;ume you will give me credit without calling for &s;uch a ma&s;s of evidence, I &s;hall only mention, at pre&s;ent, one te&s;t of her affection for you, that I am apprehen&s;ive you will think a little unpalatable,
<PB N="191" REF="193">
and I would willingly a&s;&s;i&s;t you to reli&s;h and di|ge&s;t it: She has re&s;olved not to employ her own dear dainty fingers in writing any &s;ort of an|&s;wer to your ingenious love-letter. Here I &s;ee you &s;tare and frown, and prote&s;t that it is im|po&s;&s;ible! that &s;he mu&s;t write to you! that com|mon politene&s;s requires it! with a thou&s;and other prote&s;tations full of &s;urprize, di&s;appoint|ment, anger, &s;pleen, and love. Alas, my dear friend, I fear this rotation of turbulent &s;enti|ments is a nece&s;&s;ary tax, that all mortals mu&s;t pay for their amorous delights, however licen|tious or legitimate, however gro&s;s or refined. I have ju&s;t paid the galling tax my&s;elf; and feel it &s;o heavy, that I am almo&s;t on the point of relinqui&s;hing for ever what I can only hold by a tenure &s;o tormenting; a certain female, who&s;e capricious love for me is a &s;ecret to all the world but you, has &s;eized me, &s;ince your departure, beyond all de&s;cription.

<P><PB N="192" REF="194">It may be &s;o, my good friend; I confe&s;s &s;he is of as &s;oft and delicate a mould as I ever ob|&s;erved in a female: but &s;he is a woman; and as &s;uch &s;he will infallibly try the patience of her lover, e&s;pecially as &s;he has one who can hardly reckon patience among the con&s;titutional cha|racteri&s;tics of his temper.</P>
<P>But to return to the point whence I have &s;adly digre&s;&s;ed, her re&s;olution not to write to you, and the rea&s;on why you &s;hould contemplate that re&s;olution with more plea&s;ure than chagrin: had &s;he not loved you, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly you would have had a letter from her; for I think, as I know you do, that &s;he ought <HI>in courte&s;y</HI> to write; &s;o &s;he ought <HI>in di&s;cretion</HI>; but the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and accompli&s;hed women perpetually over-&s;hoot their mark on this ground. Whenever they conceive a vehement affection, they never fail to betray them&s;elves at an early period of it, by an exce&s;s of re&s;erve. Cornelia, however, thinks &s;he has a full excu&s;e for not writing to you, in the opportunity &s;he has of conveying her thanks to you, by her corre&s;pondence with the dear, though un&s;een, Giuliana. I own I would give &s;omething for a view of their &s;ingular and my&s;|terious corre&s;pondence; but even Lucy, who is treated with great confidence by your ingenuous though timid widow, is not permitted to &s;ee a line, and can only di&s;cover that Giuliana has &s;poke of you with that friendly enthu&s;ia&s;m which your &s;ignal &s;ervices have de&s;erved. Pray tell that divine woman, if &s;he is really a woman, and not a being of a higher cla&s;s, that I adore her more than ever, as I am &s;ure you mu&s;t, for this
<PB N="193" REF="195">
bold, yet delicate method, of expre&s;&s;ing her gratitude to you. I con&s;ider their corre&s;pon|dence as a &s;triking omen in your favour; but what omens can a lover want to in&s;pire him with courage, who has vi&s;ible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart to which he a&s;pires?</P>
<P>I will only &s;ay, therefore, be confident, be cautious, and be happy.</P>
<P>I know your active &s;pirit will fret now, becau&s;e you have no commi&s;&s;ions from your Dulcinea, or I &s;hould rather &s;ay your Dido, to employ you; but I will take pity on you, &s;o far as to tell you an article &s;he wants, though I que&s;tion if you can find it where you are; &s;he has a fancy for a beautiful and &s;pirited, yet gentle white &s;teed, with a full mane and tail; in &s;hort, &s;uch a pal|frey as Dido might have been proud to mount when &s;he rode by the &s;ide of the Trojan Prince.</P>
<P>Now do not quit the ho&s;pitable roof of the no|ble Seignor Pinelli; do not give up your pro|jected re&s;idence at Rome, to plunge into tho&s;e wilds of Arabia where the mo&s;t beautiful hor&s;es are to be found, and where a hor&s;e, as travellers tell us, is brought to practi&s;e the mo&s;t &s;pirited and the mo&s;t gentle of human virtues, by being cheri&s;hed as a friend, and care&s;&s;ed as a child.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>NO, my dear Edmund, I write to you, not from Arabia, but from Rome. Here is your impetuous friend; but, alas, his impetuo|&s;ity, like that of Rome, is no more. In truth, I am as much reduced in &s;pirit, and as cre&s;t-fallen, as this poor old draggled-tail Queen of cities her&s;elf. I am as much mortified and as &s;plene|tic as one of her paralytic, yet ambitious, car|dinals, who has ju&s;t lo&s;t his animating pro&s;pect of the papal throne. Notwith&s;tanding all the kind ingenuity of your friend&s;hip to &s;often my chagrin, I am wretched, under the uncivil and barbarous re&s;olution of Cornelia not to an&s;wer my letter! Shall I frankly confe&s;s to you, how violently I was at fir&s;t affected by her unexpected &s;ilence? it inflamed my pride almo&s;t to frenzy; and half-pal&s;ied my love. Had the divine Giu|liana been acce&s;&s;ible as a wife, I &s;hould, I be|lieve, in the in&s;tant have united my de&s;tiny to hers; but I did not wound our exqui&s;itely feel|ing and open-hearted friend by any &s;uch propo|&s;al; and this angelic creature has joined her efforts to yours, in trying to per&s;ude me, that I ought to con&s;ider an in&s;ult as a proof of affec|tion. Alas, my dear monitors, how fallacious
<PB N="196" REF="198">
are your arguments! do women he&s;itate to write, when their pa&s;&s;ions are awakened? No, no; to &s;cribble when they really love, is the fir&s;t delight of their &s;ouls; it is their pa&s;&s;ion, even in infancy; and their little fingers itch to &s;crawl a billet-doux before they can well hold a pen. No; it is plain enough, her heart turns from me with abhorrence; and for this I am indebted, I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;ome of her pious friends: but they, and &s;he her&s;elf, &s;hall feel, if I live, that I am not to be in&s;ulted with impunity; they may make me, if they plea&s;e, an object of their ha|tred; but never of their contempt.</P>
<P>That you, my dear &s;ober friend, may not think me too precipitate in my indignation, I mu&s;t tell you, Giuliana has had a &s;econd letter from Cornelia; and would not &s;hew me a line of it, though I begged for the indulgence as if my very being depended on a peru&s;al of that tor|menting paper. The friendly angel has vainly tried both to argue and to laugh away my re&s;ent|ment; promi&s;ing, that, if I behave well, &s;he will treat me with a whole paragraph from the next epi&s;tle: but I will not allow even her charitable virtue and her enchanting &s;pirit to je&s;t away my very ju&s;t indigna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion; and to act as a proxy for Cornelia, in making a fool of my heart.</P>
<P>How fully have I experienced, &s;ince I entered this city, the truth of Meta&s;ta&s;io's maxim, that objects change their appearance according to the tranquility or the tempe&s;t in our hearts. When I paid my fir&s;t vi&s;it to Rome, a very few years ago, with what ardour did I a&s;cend to the capitol! my pul&s;e &s;eemed to beat with Roman energy as
<PB N="197" REF="199">
I &s;urveyed the monuments of Roman magnifi|cence; and my &s;oul caught fire in the recollec|tion of tho&s;e heroes who&s;e virtues illuminated the &s;cene around me: it is not &s;o now; the&s;e ruins and palaces, this &s;trange mixture of debility and &s;plendor, only feeds my &s;pleen and increa&s;es my melancholy; yet I am plea&s;ed to wander alone among &s;hattered columns and broken arches, and find &s;omewhat of &s;oothing &s;ympathy between grandeur in de&s;olation and love in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from &s;auntering, and lean|ing, a gloomy reverie, again&s;t one of the three pillars that remain of the temple which that cold-blooded coward Augu&s;tus built to Jupiter Tonans, on his narrow e&s;cape from a deadly fla&s;h of lightning; and &s;o &s;tormy were my thoughts in this &s;tation, that I almo&s;t wi&s;hed to meet &s;uch a &s;troke of heavenly fire as the da&s;tardly tyrant was &s;o thankful for e&s;caping.</P>
<P>Pray is it a proof of man's &s;ociability, or of his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that when our own pro&s;pects are bla&s;ted, we lo&s;e our lively intere&s;t in tho&s;e of others: the poor young Seignor Morone, with whom I am quartered here in an excellent hou&s;e, is, like other objects around me, not a little over&s;hadowed by the pre&s;ent gloom of my &s;pirit I once talked, you know, of bringing him to England, as a hu&s;band for Lucy; but pray tell her, with my kinde&s;t good wi&s;hes, I have relinqui&s;hed the project, and &s;he mu&s;t pro|vide for her&s;elf.

think that I de&s;erved, like an ungrateful and inhuman tyrant, to he cut off by a do&s;e of do|me&s;tic poi&s;on. So, in pure &s;elf-defence, I mu&s;t inform you, that your lovely opulent widow has been furiou&s;ly attacked by a mo&s;t formidable a&s;|&s;ailant; and has defended her&s;elf with infinite &s;pirit, &s;kill, and &s;ucce&s;s. In plain Engli&s;h, that I may not torture your flery imagination, let me tell you, her in&s;inuating and &s;plendid neigh|bour, the Peer, has exerted all his abilities to &s;e|cure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her hand; but with &s;o lit|tle effect, that he has now abandoned the enter|prize in ab&s;olute de&s;pair. There is a triumph for you, that you little de&s;erved in your late fit of querulous ill-humour!</P>
<P>Now do not let your exultation be as unrea|&s;onable as your &s;pleen; for &s;he does not re&s;erve her&s;elf for <HI>you</HI>; no, you wicked humori&s;t, en|gaging and all accompli&s;hed as you are, you are not good enough, &s;he &s;ays, for a hu&s;band; and as to all the other men in the world (mercy on us!) there is not any one that is merely tole|rable: &s;o, for her part (alas, the poor haple&s;s creature!) &s;he is devoted to eternal widow|hood.</P>
<P>Aye, you happy rogue, how will you make all the&s;e petty i&s;icles, that are &s;o apt to hang on the retired and &s;olitary heart of a truly delicate woman, melt at your approach in the &s;pring! Indulge not, I be&s;eech you, any &s;plenetic hu|mour; but dedicate all your feeling &s;pirit to Hope and Love. If your active and imperious fancy can torture it&s;elf in your &s;ituation, what would it do in mine connected, as I am, with a
<PB N="200" REF="202">
wayward bewitching creature, whom I can nei|ther make happy nor relinqui&s;h, and who has the art of tormenting both her&s;elf and me, by an affection on which &s;he might build, if &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a more &s;teady under&s;tanding, the happi|ne&s;s of both? Yet, perver&s;ely circum&s;tanced as I am, by the aid of a little optimi&s;tical philo&s;o|phy, I make my&s;elf tolerably contented. I think every mortal &s;hould form for him&s;elf a &s;ort or mental &s;pying-gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, looking, through the magnifying end at all the good in his de&s;tiny, and through the dimini&s;hing end at all the evil: but the greater part of mankind do exactly the rever&s;e; and hence ari&s;es more than half the mi&s;ery of human life. Hence the loud com|plaints, in every age of the world, again&s;t the general condition of our exi&s;tence. Hence the innumerable invectives again&s;t woman, the &s;ource of our mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delights. I have ju&s;t had our friend Merlon with me, for a few days, who is a thou&s;and times more &s;ubject to &s;pleen than you are; and, as he was al&s;o out of humour with his fair-one, he entertained me by inveighing again&s;t Love, with all the acrimony of a Cynic: "I think, &s;aid he, with that &s;our vehemence which you can &s;o well repre&s;ent to your&s;elf&mdash;I think Sir I&s;aac Newton was not only the wi&s;e&s;t, but the happie&s;t man that ever pa&s;&s;ed through the world; becau&s;e he kept his mind always amu&s;ed by &s;cience, and never allowed his heart to be tormented by a woman." I en|countered our moody friend as a champion for the &s;ex; and I replied, "Notwith&s;tanding my re&s;pect and my pa&s;&s;ion for &s;cience, I can never

&s;uppo&s;e that the joys ari&s;ing from intellectual pur|&s;uits are &s;uperior to tho&s;e that belong to the af|fections. Do you imagine that Newton, in his &s;ublime&s;t di&s;coveries, felt a tran&s;port equal to that of a lover, who, having doubted the fidelity of a woman he adores, finds her faithful and af|fectionate in the highe&s;t degree? Do you think that any author, in publi&s;hing a mo&s;t con&s;um|mate and celebrated production, can rejoice with an exultation &s;o delicious as that of a fa|ther, in happily completing the education of a &s;on? No, my friend, as Nature cho&s;e to make a warm heart her prime mini&s;ter for the manage|ment of her mo&s;t important concerns, &s;he ju&s;tly allotted to that mini&s;ter the riche&s;t fund of de|light."</P>
<P>You, I am &s;ure, my dear Seymour, would have taken my &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and who could have defended it &s;o well, even in the field of friend&s;hip, without entering on that of love? who could more properly decide on the joys ari&s;|ing from our affections and our faculties, than a per&s;on to whom Nature has given &s;o much warmth in the fir&s;t, and &s;o much quickne&s;s in the Later? Your adventures at Genoa would, in my opinion, determine the point; for a&s;&s;ur|edly no man of the keene&s;t intellect could feel &s;uch exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure in a &s;uppo&s;ed or real di&s;|covery of the longitude, as you felt in that happy &s;cene which you &s;o forcibly de&s;cribed to us.</P>

She has fulfilled her promi&s;e, and indulged me, though in truth I hardly de&s;erved it, with &s;uch a paragraph from the pen of my adored Cornelia, that all my proud &s;u&s;picions, and &s;urly inquietude of &s;oul, are bani&s;hed, I tru&s;t, for ever. Yes, my dear adept in the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience of woman, your judgment in my favour is confirmed; I am con|vinced that the heart of this delicate widow is, as you have kindly told me, my own; for though &s;he is too mode&s;t to make &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion to Giuliana, yet every word in which &s;he &s;peaks of me is at once a graceful proof of her delicacy, and a mo&s;t enchanting indication of her love. I feel this &s;o &s;trongly, that my angelic governe&s;s finds it expedient to admoni&s;h me not to let my ex|pectations of happine&s;s run too high. I believe, indeed, that I may now appear as much intoxi|cated with hope as I was lately exa&s;perated by de&s;pair. Ah, my dear philo&s;opher, what a re&s;t|le&s;s &s;cene of different tumults does the human bo|&s;om exhibit! yet who would wi&s;h to live in per|fect exemption from the tender tumultuous pa&s;|&s;ion? You and Lucy, perhaps, in the profun|dity of your philo&s;ophical meditations. But, if &s;o, allow me to declare, that I am not of your &s;ect; for my part, I embrace the doctrine of that charming female &s;aint of Spain, the warm-heart|ed Tere&s;a, who gave an incomparable definition of the Devil, in declaring him incapable of love. But &s;eriou&s;ly, my dear &s;peculati&s;t, it is this pa&s;&s;ion alone which can render human life to my feelings a &s;cene that I would wi&s;h to prolong. I e&s;teem

the joys of friend&s;hip very highly, yet I confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s they are in&s;ufficient to maintain that harmony in my frame which is e&s;&s;ential to its welfare. My feelings perhaps are &s;ingular and romantic in a great degree. I pretend not to &s;ay they are ju&s;t what they ought to be; but I tell you very truly what they are. When I fancy my&s;elf not beloved, my whole frame appears to me as a heavy, auk|ward, and u&s;ele&s;s &s;tatue of black marble; but as &s;oon as the ri&s;ing beams of affection play upon it, the dark ma&s;s begins to be animated, like the famous &s;tatue of Memnon at the ri&s;e of the &s;un; every fibre &s;eems to vibrate with harmony and joy. Such, my dear Edmund, are my own &s;en&s;ations in the pre&s;ent moment; yet I have certainly a &s;triking example before me in our dear Giuliana, that it is po&s;&s;ible for a being of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibi|lity to be contented (I may almo&s;t &s;ay happy) not only without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the enjoyments of love, but in the ab&s;olute per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;ion of having relinqui&s;h|ed them for ever: yet it is not &s;o; for Love is &s;till predominant in this lovely creature: her heart is with Peverell in Heaven; and all her very tender and very &s;ucce&s;sful attention to her delight|ed father is only a method adopted by her love to en&s;ure her re-union with the prime idol of her &s;oul. She is happier, perhaps, in this idea, than &s;he could have been with the living lord of her heart. There is a delicious and &s;ublime tranquil|lity in a pa&s;&s;ion for the dead, that can perhaps belong to no other affection; at lea&s;t this idea &s;trikes me, when I contemplate the pre&s;ent &s;era|phic &s;erenity of Giuliana. Do not think, how|ever, that I am de&s;irous of con&s;igning my lovely

Cornelia to the grave, for the &s;ake of loving her with a more inten&s;e and more tranquil ardour. Enthu&s;ia&s;t as I am, my extravagances are not &s;o gloomy; and I &s;hall content my&s;elf with the hope of &s;oon pre&s;enting to your contemplation two ob|jects which I have heard your acute wor&s;hip re|pre&s;ent as the greate&s;t rarities in the world; I mean, love unabated by fruition, and friend&s;hip unimpaired by marriage.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t made a plea&s;ant compact with Giu|liana and her farther, who is metamorpho&s;ed by his divine daughter into one of the mo&s;t gentle, generous, and engaging characters, that I ever met with: you know I have a particular venera|tion for tho&s;e rare old men who pre&s;erve, with elegance of manners, a warmth and tenderne&s;s of heart in the latter &s;tages of life. Pinelli has now all the&s;e endearing qualities; for his two predo|minant failings, a love of money, and a pa&s;sion for importance, are perfectly cured, by his con|viction that opulence and rank are of little value to that angelic child of his, for who&s;e &s;ake he was once &s;o &s;olicitous to increa&s;e his con&s;equence and his wealth. Giuliana has made him amiable and happy, by annihilating his avarice and ambition. His feelings are naturally &s;trong; he had no child but Giuliana; he loved her inten&s;ely; and that love, the main &s;pring of his life, after being pain|fully counteracted by indignation and re&s;entment, has at length recovered its force and freedom, and enlarged the circle of its activity. His pa&s;t anger has given new energy to his pre&s;ent affec|tion. He not only loves his daughter better than he ever did; but he &s;eems to love me almo&s;t as
<PB N="206" REF="208">
much as if I were really her brother, for hav|ing been, under Heaven and you, the fortu|nate in&s;trument of her re&s;toration to his parental arms. He flatters me on my talents, &s;uch as they are; he rallies me on my foibles, and, in &s;hort, treats me exactly as a &s;on very dear to him: but, in giving you this &s;ketch of his regenerated character, I have forgot to tell you our com|pact.</P>
<P>It is briefly this: if I marry Cornelia (oh, that abominable <HI>if!</HI> it chills my blood; let me there|fore &s;ay, <HI>when</HI> I marry Cornelia, our friends of Genoa are bound to vi&s;it me in England, on the aniver&s;ary of my wedding, provided I can a&s;&s;ure them, on my honour, that, in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t half year, I have not experienced a &s;ingle &s;plenetic hour: if, on the contrary, I am reduced to confe&s;s,

<P>I Now write to you, my dear Edmund, not from Arabia, but from a &s;pot which your &s;ar|ca&s;tic penetration could not fore&s;ee a chance of my vi&s;iting: behold me on the banks of the Tagus! aye, verily, in Li&s;bon!

mo&s;t deplorable &s;ort of weakne&s;s that can fall on the mind and body of a feeble half-&s;pirited mortal, and literally dying of a rage to live. His two good though ungraceful &s;i&s;ters, who will &s;oon be repaid by his ample fortune for a long and wretched attendance on this &s;elfi&s;h &s;keleton, have led him about, from place to place, ju&s;t according to the whim&s;ical dictates of his own querulous, mutable, &s;ickly mind; which, in&s;tead of teaching him to expect and await the &s;troke of death like a man, makes him crawl about like a whining child, and fooli&s;hly &s;eek, by the mo&s;t uncomfortable pere|grination through various countries, that health which no climate can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;tore to him. For my own part, I confe&s;s his de&s;picable and &s;elfi&s;h avidity for life, burthen&s;ome as it is to him&s;elf and his relations, has annihilated my pity for his per&s;onal &s;ufferings; and had I been one of his &s;i&s;ters I &s;hould, I believe, have been more eager to &s;end him acro&s;s the Styx, than to convey him to the banks of the Tagus: but the&s;e good wo|men have an inexhau&s;tible fund of affectionate compa&s;&s;ion; they have charmed me by their in|defatigable humanity; and when the elde&s;t in|formed me of her wi&s;h, that &s;he hardly knew how to accompli&s;h, of indulging her emaciated brother in his anxious fancy to pa&s;s the month of March at Li&s;bon, I, like a true knight-errant as you know I am, immediately offered my &s;ervices to e&s;cort them hither. A di&s;mal piece of work I have had of it; but here we are; and I have been rewarded for my trouble, not by &s;eeing the &s;ick man revive, or expire, for he is neither bet|ter nor wor&s;e, but by meeting accidentally with

<P>WE are apprehen&s;ive, my good tender-hearted girl, that you will be frightened out of your wits by the ha&s;ty letter di&s;patched to you in the alarm of ye&s;terday, as I confe&s;s I was by the &s;ummons which brought me to the bed|&s;ide of our dear Harriot, from whence I now write to you, not, I thank Heaven, to increa&s;e, but to relieve you from your terror.</P>
<P>She is &s;orely brui&s;ed, indeed, by the accident, and there is rea&s;on to apprehend an event which may deprive me of the opportunity I expected, of be&s;towing my fine Roman name, as you call it, on a little Mi&s;s Audley; but our invaluable friend has e&s;caped miraculou&s;ly, con&s;idering the horrid circum&s;tances of her overturn.

the white palfrey, was a few miles behind me. My intention was to find quarters for the night at the little inn on the extremity of the heath, and to pre&s;ent both my&s;elf and the palfrey to my fair idol the next morning. I was meditating how to manage my introduction in the mo&s;t de|cent and graceful manner, when ju&s;t as I ar|rived at the fir&s;t little private door leading from the park to the common, and neare&s;t the hou&s;e, a &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf to me that I &s;hall never forget as long as I exi&s;t: the fir&s;t object I &s;aw was the younge&s;t of the little Sedleys, &s;tanding &s;till, and roaring in an agony of infantine di&s;|tre&s;s; ju&s;t beyond him his brother, the little heroic William, trying, with all his might, to di&s;engage a large &s;tone from the earth; for what purpo&s;e, do you think? why, truly, to &s;erve the noble little hero as offen&s;ive arms again&s;t an elderly but gigantic ruffian, who at that moment had got his beautiful nur&s;e in his gra&s;p, and was forcibly carrying her to a chai&s;e that &s;tood ready. You will &s;uppo&s;e that I in&s;tantly joined the con|flict, on the &s;ide of my mo&s;t gallant little friend and confederate William, who had actually drawn blood from the &s;tout and barbarous fellow that had &s;eized his nur&s;e, by throwing a &s;harp and heavy &s;tone at his legs. I made my attack on the oppo&s;ite quarter, and catching hold of his collar in&s;i&s;ted on his relea&s;ing the woman. Being one of the mo&s;t athletic men I ever &s;aw, and frantic with various pa&s;&s;ions, he griped her fa&s;t in his left arm, and threw me from him with his right. He then a&s;&s;erted no very clear title to the beauty in que&s;tion; &s;wore the jilt, as
<PB N="217" REF="219">
he called her, had promi&s;ed to marry him, and added another oath to announce a re&s;olution of &s;hooting any man who mole&s;ted him in &s;ecuring her per&s;on. In the mean time, the poor terrified female denied his a&s;&s;ertions, called him &s;ome har&s;h names, which &s;erved to let me know my antagoni&s;t (he is a man of no trifling note, I a&s;&s;ure you); and, with the mo&s;t piercing &s;up|plication, implored me to per&s;evere in her re&s;cue.

I wi&s;h to Heaven I could give you a perfect idea of the wonderful &s;pirit and affectionate endearing ge&s;tures of this brave little urchin: he will hardly quit me a mo|ment; and the dear boy even petitioned to &s;leep in my chamber, for fear, he &s;aid, I &s;hould want his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the night.

<P>But to proceed in my hi&s;tory. When nur&s;e arrived again at the gate, with her new and well-armed champion, the enemy was not only flying, but out of &s;ight. Being foiled in his fu|rious love, and dreading the chance, we &s;up|po&s;e, of being &s;topped for an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, he had jumped into his po&s;t chai&s;e, and driven off with the utmo&s;t rapidity. The re&s;cued fair, thus ef|fectually delivered from her fears, now exerted the mo&s;t lively compa&s;&s;ion, and gratitude towards me. It was no ea&s;y matter to convey me to the hou&s;e; for, be&s;ides my wound, which bled in a manner that terrified my two a&s;&s;i&s;tants, I had &s;omehow got a &s;prain, which rendered me unable to walk. As ill luck would have it, the coach|man

and groom were out with their hor&s;es. What was to be done? Fortunately for me, the keeper recollected a little low garden-chair, in which his poor decea&s;ed ma&s;ter u&s;ed to be drawn, by a &s;ervant, to his favourite &s;pots in the park: in this I was &s;oon &s;eated; and the hone&s;t fellow, with my zealous friend William, who in&s;i&s;ted on having his little hand in the bu&s;ine&s;s, drew me to the hou&s;e. Faint and full of pain as I was, I could not help &s;miling at the figure I made in this triumphal car, followed by the beau|tiful and truly grateful dam&s;el that I had re&s;cued, who, carrying the younge&s;t boy in her arms, walk|ed clo&s;e behind me, with the mo&s;t touching &s;oli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tude for the ea&s;e and &s;afety of her deliverer. I que&s;tion it Alexander or Cae&s;ar ever enjoyed a triumphant proce&s;&s;ion &s;o cordially as I did; my vanity &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that this incident would render me the hero and the idol of this man&s;ion. In truth, all the dome&s;tics of it &s;eem as eager to do me honour and &s;ervice as vanity it&s;elf can de&s;ire; a few hours will, I hope, convince me, that their divine mi&s;tre&s;s is as &s;en&s;ibly affected as they are by my adventure, and as eager to &s;atisfy the ambition of my love.</P>
<P>But I have not yet told you all the events of la&s;t night. As &s;oon as the men and hor&s;es came in the rogues had been gallanting their &s;weet|hearts to a di&s;tant fair), one was di&s;patched for the neare&s;t &s;urgeon, and another &s;ent to inform his mi&s;tre&s;s that &s;he had a wounded knight in her ca&s;tle. The la&s;t me&s;&s;enger fortunately met the &s;urgeon, whom I de&s;cribed to you la&s;t night, a few miles from this hou&s;e. He is a mo&s;t agree|able

fellow, and, I believe, at this moment under this roof; for, being high in favour with Cornelia, and a continual agent to her exten&s;ive charity, he often &s;leeps here, I find, for the convenience of vi&s;iting the various poor patients of the neighbourhood whom &s;he con&s;igns to his care. It was his intention to do &s;o la&s;t night, he &s;aid, before he heard of my accident. He is a very penetrating as well as a plea&s;ant fellow, and has &s;omehow or other picked up an idea that the lovely widow has honoured me with her affec|tion. I intend to &s;ecure him very firmly in my intere&s;t; and, as I am &s;ituated at pre&s;ent, I may find him a very u&s;eful ally. He is a fine &s;tout warm-hearted &s;on of Ae&s;culapius and Lucina, with a prolific little wife and multitudinous brood of children at home. But neither hou&s;ehold cares, nor the wounds and maladies he has to cure, &s;eem to rob him of his peaceful morning &s;lumber; for, though he promi&s;ed to vi&s;it me early, I have nor yet heard him &s;tiring.</P>
<P>You will begin to grow angry with me, for keeping you &s;o long ignorant of the formidable ravi&s;her, who was &s;o near carrying off the luxu|riant beauty that I once promi&s;ed to &s;end you, like a rich gift of ancient heroic times.

a delicious little romance, and you &s;hall have it entire. I cannot however begin it at pre&s;ent; for here comes my &s;weet boy, my brave little Wil|liam, my earlie&s;t vi&s;iter, to enquire after his wounded friend. I have indeed &s;cribbled till I am weary; &s;o adieu for &s;ome hours.</P>

<HEAD>SEYMOUR in Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>SHE is arrived! &s;he has been in my cham|ber! &s;he has been in my arms! I have folded her to my heart with all the impa&s;&s;ioned pre&s;&s;ure of Love, Hope, Supplication, Gratitude, and Rapture. Heavens, what a moment! I thought I was literally on the point of expiring with de|light! Never did I touch in my life &s;uch a pair of lips! to ravi&s;hingly &s;weet! &s;o tran&s;cendently voluptuous! Venus was a &s;impleton when &s;he di&s;tilled her nectar upon them, for &s;he mu&s;t have made them ten times &s;weeter than her own. I could rave about them for hours. Giuliana, in|deed, has a lovely mouth; but her lips, compar|ed to my Cornelia's, are like a &s;tony pear com|pared to a melting peach. Had only ten drops of blood been le&s;t in my &s;hattered frame, they mu&s;t, I think, have boiled in my veins at the unequivocal &s;ymptoms of this lovely creature's affection. Oh, Edmund, I never &s;aw &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ion before in the "female face divine." No language can de&s;cribe the enchanting mix|ture of tenderne&s;s and of terror that her &s;weet impa&s;&s;ioned features exhibited while I pre&s;&s;ed her
<PB N="222" REF="224">
to my bo&s;om. But tenderne&s;s was the predomi|nant &s;en&s;ation: her very heart and &s;oul &s;eemed to di&s;&s;olve in a cha&s;te angelic ex&s;tacy, while I prote&s;ted, with literal truth, that it is my ardent wi&s;h to die of my pre&s;ent wound in her &s;ervice, if my life is not de&s;tined to be the &s;ource of her la&s;ting happine&s;s. The tear of gratitude and of &s;ympathy &s;welled in her &s;weet eyes, and &s;he &s;uffered me to take &s;uch a ki&s;s as would have overpaid the angui&s;h of a hundred wounds: &s;uch a ki&s;s! &mdash; You mu&s;t not however prophanely &s;uppo&s;e, that the dear divine creature has been any ways deficient either in di&s;cretion or in de|licacy; verily I think her conduct has been a model of both. But I tell the &s;tory vilely, and, from an eagerne&s;s to acquaint you with my fe|licity, I have jumped into the middle of my tran&s;ports, without relating any of the little in|cidents that conducted me to them.</P>
<P>I will now endeavour to grow a little more &s;ober in my narrative. Let me begin by inform|ing you, that my lovely ho&s;te&s;s arrived here about noon; and, after a gentle me&s;&s;age, entered my chamber (for the wounds that I have receiv|ed both from Mars and Cupid con&s;pire to keep me in bed). Bren&s;il, my &s;urgeon, was her gen|tleman u&s;her, and the dear brave little William her page. I would give any &s;um for an exact &s;ketch of her angelic countenance, in the mo|ment when her eye was fir&s;t fixed on my poor pallid figure. No painter, I believe, could do full ju&s;tice to &s;o con&s;ummate a model of compa&s;|&s;ion, tenderne&s;s, and beauty. After a brief dia|logue of concern and gratitude on her part, and
<PB N="223" REF="225">
common gallantry on mine, I gave a &s;ignificant glance to my &s;en&s;ible &s;urgeon, whom I had &s;een before in the morning; and he obligingly quitted my room, with a promi&s;e of a &s;peedy return. In a few minutes I contrived to remove my little friend William on a trifling commi&s;&s;ion, and forcibly detained the lovely mother, who would have retreated with her &s;on. I told her what perhaps was very true, that my life ab&s;olutely de|pended on her indulging me in a few moments of private conver&s;ation; I had ob&s;erved how deeply &s;he was touched with pity at the fir&s;t &s;ight of me; and as pity, we know, is a friend to love, I re&s;olved to make the mo&s;t of this very favourable fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The moment we were alone I bur&s;t into the mo&s;t explicit avowal of my pa&s;&s;ion. The dear blu&s;hing creature would have &s;topt me, by repre|&s;enting &s;uch a &s;ubject as peculiarly unfit for the time; and conjured me to con&s;ult the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of my health, by bani&s;hing all ideas that could agitate my mind. I need not tell you my romantic reply to this friendly argument; my incomparable Cornelia, who had been cover|ed with a crim&s;on confu&s;ion at the fir&s;t declara|tion of my love, now began to di&s;play, not only great pre&s;ence, but great dignity of mind; and &s;he addre&s;&s;ed me in the following manner, with a compo&s;ure and gentle firmne&s;s of &s;pirit that &s;truck me with new and aweful admiration: "Do not di&s;tre&s;s me, my very generous friend, by &s;aying things to which I cannot po&s;&s;ibly li&s;ten without a very painful degree of &s;elf-reproach. As you have ju&s;t laid me under the greate&s;t obli|gation,
<PB N="224" REF="226">
let your genero&s;ity ab&s;tain from every thing that can look like taking an advantage or my gratitude: believe me, I am anxious in the highe&s;t degree for the pre&s;ervation of your valua|ble life, which you hazarded &s;o nobly in the deliverance of a lovely woman, who, though her condition is humble, has a mind of a &s;uperior ca&s;t, and is endeared to me more as a friend than a dome&s;tic. Her hi&s;tory is &s;ingularly in|tere&s;ting: you have pre&s;erved her from the ba&s;e&s;t of injuries; and her gratitude is &s;o ardent, that, if &s;he knew your pre&s;ent addre&s;s to me, we &s;hould perhaps &s;ee her on her knees before me, to wre&s;t from me a promi&s;e which you &s;ay is e&s;&s;ential to your recovery. Solicitous as I am for your &s;afe|ty, and attached as I am to the grateful Caroline, it is po&s;&s;ible that your joint entreaties might drive me to utter the words you require; but reflect a moment, my gallant friend, what would your &s;en&s;ations be if you &s;aw me embarra&s;&s;ed and made wretched by having ha&s;tily uttered a compa&s;&s;ionate promi&s;e, which my whole &s;oul was deliberately de&s;irous of retracting." Here I ex|claimed, "Oh, my divine Cornelia, you &s;hall promi&s;e nothing; you &s;hall be free as air: yet love me; for Heaven's &s;ake, love me; or do not barbarou&s;ly endeavour to prolong my exi&s;tence!" In &s;aying this, I ki&s;&s;ed her hand with the mo&s;t tender vehemence, and, in&s;tead of withdrawing it from my pa&s;&s;ionate pre&s;&s;ure, &s;he thus conti|nued her di&s;cour&s;e: "Let not my great aver&s;ion to every thing that looks like prudery induce you, my good Seymour, to mi&s;interpret my in|tentions: I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, if I attempted
<PB N="225" REF="227">
to conceal from you that I am highly flattered by your partiality; and that my heart is full of gratitude and e&s;teem towards you. It is, I think, incumbent on every woman or real delicacy to avoid all appearances of coquetti&s;h duplicity, and fluctuating inclinations, with tho&s;e who have any claim to her regard. For my own part, it is my wi&s;h to treat you with all the tender frank|ne&s;s of a &s;i&s;ter; but, in return for the openne&s;s with which I reveal to you the re&s;olutions of my heart, I mu&s;t expect you to acquie&s;ce in my &s;incere de&s;ire. Wound me not, I conjure you, with farther &s;olicitation, when I have told you, as I do with the mo&s;t perfect truth, that I have &s;eriou&s;ly determined, for the &s;ake of my children, never to think of marrying again."</P>
<P>You will readily &s;uppo&s;e that I combated this idea with every argument that Rea&s;on, Nature, and Love, could &s;ugge&s;t. In clo&s;ing the&s;e vari|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious pleas I &s;aid, in a vehement peroration, "that if I obeyed her de&s;ire, and &s;ilently ac|quie&s;ced in &s;uch a re&s;olution, I &s;hould certainly de&s;erve, and probably undergo, the bittere&s;t of all puni&s;hments, the puni&s;hment of &s;eeing her torn from me for ever by a holder, more intel|ligent, and triumphant rival." I then painted &s;o forcibly the frantic agonies that I &s;hould en|dure from &s;uch a &s;pectacle, that I not only af|fected the dear tender creature, but ab&s;olutely threw my own frame into a convul&s;ion of horror. She was touched and alarmed to a great degree: "For Heaven's &s;ake, tranquillize your &s;pirits, my dear Seymour!" cried the compa&s;&s;ionate angel: think how cruel it would be to me, when
<PB N="226" REF="228">
I am &s;o very anxious for your recovery, to de|&s;troy your&s;elf by the mere phantoms of your own impetuous imagination: I know it is very galling to a high &s;pirit like yours, to meet even a &s;hadow of ingratitude where it has conferred the greate&s;t obligation; but indeed you &s;hall never find me ungrateful; and, to convince you that I am not &s;o, I will now propo&s;e &s;omething to you that may, I hope, re&s;tore you to quiet and to health. Will you promi&s;e me to calm your agitated &s;pi|rit, and to drop this &s;ubject entirely till you are well, if I a&s;&s;ure you on my word of honour, that you &s;hall never &s;ee me united to any other man?" "Oh, my angelic Cornelia, I exclaim|ed, &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance, in this moment, would place my tortured &s;pirit in paradi&s;e." "Then I give it you mo&s;t &s;olemnly," the dear angel re|plied, extending her lovely hand towards me, upon the conditions I have named."</P>
<P>Imagine to your&s;elf, my dear Edmund, my inexpre&s;&s;ible tran&s;port in this touching, this deli|cate proof of her affection. I threw around her the only arm I can u&s;e, and, pre&s;&s;ing her to my heart, &s;ealed our convention by that ec&s;tatic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which I mentioned in the out&s;et of my letter, that ki&s;s upon where &s;weetne&s;s I could yet write a folio, but of which the mo&s;t eloquent of writers would be utterly unable to give you an adequate de&s;cription.</P>
<P>When I had dwelt on her lips with the de|lightful avidity of a bee ju&s;t &s;ettled on the riche&s;t of flowers, I relea&s;ed her from an embrace which, from various rea&s;ons, began to grow alarming; and, to &s;hew her with what punctili|ous
<PB N="227" REF="229">
honour I would adhere to the terms of her charitable treaty, I began to talk on different, yet &s;till intere&s;ting topics. Fir&s;t, the health of my good unfortunate friend your &s;i&s;ter Harriot, which I have the plea&s;ure to tell you is very nearly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Secondly, the very curi|ous adventures of my re&s;cued virgin, the luxu|riant, the grateful, the intere&s;ting Caroline. I long to tell you her &s;tory; but I mu&s;t &s;till re&s;erve it for a future letter. I will not, however, clo&s;e this without telling you a delightful touch of her gratitude to me, which I have this moment learnt from Bren&s;il. The intelligent creature, &s;u&s;pecting that I was half frantic with impatience for an opportunity to make love to Cornelia, very ingeniou&s;ly contrived, not only to prevent the child's returning to me, but to engage Bren|&s;il al&s;o in &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional bu&s;ine&s;s, that allowed me a much longer period for private conver&s;ation than I could have &s;ecured without her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. My &s;agacious &s;urgeon, who has a mo&s;t rapid eye in reading characters and motives of conduct, &s;aw through the grateful girl's de&s;ign, and made her very hone&s;tly confe&s;s it. He is a great fa|vourite, I find, with all the women, and I fancy an admirable proficient in female ca&s;es. It is a rule with him, he tells me, to con&s;ider the heart as the prime fountain of health and &s;ickne&s;s, in more &s;en&s;es than one; and he is very &s;hy of giv|ing medicine to his patients till he has &s;omehow or other gained an in&s;ight into the &s;tate of their affections. If my dear widow &s;hould call for his medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I believe the rogue would be almo&s;t ready to pound me in his mortar, and
<PB N="228" REF="230">
di&s;patch me to her in the &s;hape of a bolus; &s;o convinced is he that I am the only &s;pecific for any complaints to which her lovely frame can at pre&s;ent be &s;ubject. Having told you his &s;y&s;tem, I leave you to gue&s;s if I did not follow the pre|cept of my Bible, and honour my phy&s;ician with the honour due unto him. Pray ob&s;erve, how religious I am growing; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, good|night; for I can write no longer. Yet I have not told you, that my divine Cornelia indulged her children and me in a reque&s;t we made, and graciou&s;ly took part of a little repa&s;t with them in my chamber: after which &s;he departed im|mediately, to re&s;ume the care of your &s;i&s;ter; but, in departing, &s;he gave me &s;uch a deliciou&s;ly tender <HI>adieu,</HI> that I could wi&s;h to do nothing but dream of it till I &s;ee her again. In that hope, I bid you once more, and for the la&s;t time, good-night.</P>
<P>I cannot throw down my pen, without en|treating you to di&s;mi&s;s all the friendly anxiety that I know you and Lucy will feel concerning my wound. I am anxious le&s;t it &s;hould be heal|ed too &s;oon, and oblige me to quit this man&s;ion of bli&s;s for too long an interval, before I can make the lovely mi&s;tre&s;s of it my own.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. MRS. AUDLEY TO LUCY.</HEAD>
<P>BLESS us all, my dear Lucy, what a hurly-burly of ca&s;ualties, &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;orrow, we have had among us! But, thank Heaven, our pro&s;pect is growing bright again in every quarter. &mdash;To begin with my&s;elf: You will, I know, re|joice to hear that I am once more on my legs; nor will it afflict you to be informed, that I am going to make a charitable use of the liberty I have ju&s;t regained, and to attend our dear widow in her &s;econd vi&s;it to the brave wounded knight in her ca&s;tle. There's &s;pirit and enterprize for you, my dear romantic girl! there's a bleeding lover ready made by fortune for your pen to celebrate, ju&s;t as your own fancy would make one, according to the true pattern of good old ro|mance. If you are di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e your ge|nius in painting impa&s;&s;ioned &s;cenes from the life, you mu&s;t quit the pen&s;ive philo&s;ophical batchelor, and take your abode with us; for ours, you find, is the region of adventure. Well, 'tis a great ble&s;&s;ing that we can now laugh at the wounds of our young champion, which threw us all at fir&s;t into a terrible con&s;ternation. Edmund and you, I &s;uppo&s;e, have had a full hi&s;tory from him&s;elf of all that befell him. He may have de&s;cribed to you the delightful vi&s;it of his lady ho&s;te&s;s. Ah,
<PB N="232" REF="234">
my dear Lucy, what a vi&s;it was that for the ac|compli&s;hment of our wi&s;hes! The whole bu&s;ine&s;s is done, my dear. You may begin to work the bridal &s;hoes you talked of pre&s;enting to her. Would you believe it? The dear &s;crupulous creature was alone with him for an hour in his chamber! "Dreadful indi&s;cretion!" &s;he exclaim|ed in confe&s;&s;ing it. "Mercy upon us, cried I, 'tis well this tremendous hero had one arm di&s;abled." But her gentle frank heart was &s;o open in its con|fe&s;&s;ions, &s;he came back to me with an agitated bo|&s;om, &s;o full of pity, gratitude, and of love, that I could not bear to rally her long. Be&s;ides, I was, I confe&s;s, very impatient to know, as you will be if you do not know it already, what matrimonial advances our hero had made in &s;o favourable an interview; and what conce&s;&s;ions he had obtained from our lovely &s;crupulous friend: no trifling one, I can a&s;&s;ure you; &s;he has promi&s;ed him ne|ver to marry another man. The lover has who in|duced his mi&s;tre&s;s to give up for him all the re&s;t of his &s;ex, mu&s;t be a weak pleader indeed if he does not proceed a little farther in his argument, and at la&s;t prevail on the fair-one to make him a pre&s;ent or her&s;elf.</P>
<P>You and I, my dear Lucy, may now, I think, &s;et our hearts at re&s;t on this match; it is a favou|rite point with both of us, and a point that For|tune &s;eems as eager to accomphli&s;h as we are. I expect my dear Audley at home again in a few days, I need not tell you with what affectionate impatience. My father, who had heard of my late accident, is coming with him. It gives me particular delight, that I &s;hall pre&s;ent your fa|vourite Seymour to them both with &s;uch an accu|mulation

of honour on his head. He has not only endeared him&s;elf to us women by his courage in this adventure; but he is ju&s;t now very gene|rou&s;ly exerting his intere&s;t to redre&s;s all the wrongs of poor Caroline's per&s;ecuted lover. Could you have thought that the old Admiral would have &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;uch a frantic brute? What horrid imperious creatures men are apt to be! Becau&s;e this rough veteran has &s;hed his blood very freely, they &s;ay, in the &s;ervice of his country, he thought him&s;elf entitled to make as free as he plea&s;ed with the cha&s;tity of her daughters; but his outrage to Caroline is rendered doubly dete&s;table by his ba&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion of his young fa|voured rival, who, however inferior to him in rank, is certainly, from what I have learned of his &s;ufferings, more truly brave than him&s;elf. If Seymour can accompli&s;h his generous project of uniting this very hand&s;ome and cruelly injured couple, he may, I think, command the &s;ervice of all hone&s;t lovers throughout the world. As to poor Caroline, who is, yon know, a &s;weet grateful creature, &s;he, I find, perfectly wor&s;hips him already. So, if Cornelia &s;hould affect to be inexorably cruel, which is not, I think, very pro|bable, &s;he mu&s;t be driven into wedlock by a gene|ral per&s;ecution from her own &s;ex; in which I know the voice of the dear zealous Lucy will be as loud as that of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>AS I think an intere&s;ting love-&s;tory no bad me|dicine, my dear Edmund, to in&s;pirit the imgination of a &s;ick philo&s;opher, and as I have nothing new to tell you in the progre&s;s of my own pa&s;&s;ion; I devote this paper to the promi&s;ed ac|count of my humble, yet lovely ward, the very grateful Caroline. I heartily wi&s;h you could have the high plea&s;ure that I have had, I mean, the plea&s;ure of hearing this little &s;tory mo&s;t admirably told by the eloquent lips of thankful &s;implicity. But, as I have laid you under an injunction not to ha&s;ten to the hou&s;e where Caroline is to be heard, I &s;hall exerci&s;e as well as can, for your amu&s;ement, the agreeable office of her hi&s;torian; if I may tru&s;t my own feelings in li&s;tening to her narrative, the adventures of few beauties are more worthy of being recorded.</P>
<P>I hardly know where to begin my hi&s;tory; be|cau&s;e I imagine that your lively intelligent &s;i&s;ter, who never lets an intere&s;ting tender &s;tory e&s;cape her, mu&s;t have heard from Cornelia, and proba|bly communicated to you, many particulars re|lating to this captivating girl; yet as that may not be the ca&s;e, I &s;hall briefly tell you the fir&s;t
<PB N="235" REF="237">
incidents of her &s;ingular life. Caroline Southcote is the daughter of an hone&s;t and jovial farmer, who, living with more ho&s;pitality than di&s;|cretion, left a widow, embarra&s;&s;ed in circum|&s;tances, and over-burthened with a numerous fa|mily. It happened that the &s;quire of their pari&s;h had a brother &s;ettled abroad, as a con&s;ul in Spain, who, marrying a Spani&s;h lady, reque&s;ted his brother to &s;end him over a young Engli&s;h girl, to attend on his wife. The lot fell on Caroline, whole merit and &s;ituation out-weighed her want of age and experience: &s;he was a mere child when &s;he was &s;ent into this foreign &s;ervice, but a very few years converted her into &s;uch a wo|man as might inflame to madne&s;s the warm blood of a Spani&s;h Cavalier. She e&s;caped, however, the gallantry of Spain, to be more roughly, and I hope in time more tenderly, handled by a Bri|ti&s;h tar; for the two objects of her abhorrence and her idolatry are &s;ailors. Ju&s;t as &s;he reached the delightful age of nineteen, in the full bloom of beauty by its nature luxuriant, and rendered &s;till &s;o perhaps, by the climate in which it expand|ed; at this critical &s;ea&s;on of her life, the ma&s;ter of Caroline was obliged by ill health to revi&s;it his native country. His amiable Spani&s;h wife em|barked with him, attended by the lovely girl, whom, as the good lady had produced no children, &s;he ever treated more as her child than her &s;ervant. They &s;ailed from Gibraltar in an Engli&s;h man of war, commanded by an Admiral, who&s;e name is well known to you, as he has often &s;ignalized his courage in the public &s;ervice. This warrior, though he is, like Othello, declined into the vale
<PB N="236" REF="238">
of years, retains, like the Moor, all his keen ap|petite for beauty; and, I may add, for revenge. He was deeply enamoured at the fir&s;t &s;ight of Ca|roline; and never, I mu&s;t &s;ay, was a compo&s;ition moulded by nature more likely to &s;et a veteran on fire. The Admiral exerted all the advantages of his &s;ituation, in trying to gratify his de&s;ire; but he found that the lovely girl was impregnable; and having never perhaps met with a repul&s;e be|fore either in Love or War, he began to &s;pecu|late on the latent cau&s;e of this unu&s;ual and un|plea&s;ant event. The &s;earching eye of authority and &s;u&s;picion &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;ource of this mortifying failure: the tender and open heart of the tempting dam&s;el was pre-occupied by a young|er a&s;&s;ailant; &s;he had entered the ve&s;&s;el with a bo|&s;om well prepared by nature for all the ardour and firmne's of genuine and honourable love; and chance recommended to her favour a fine young fellow, who has proved him&s;elf, I think, com|pletely worthy of her pa&s;&s;ionate attachment; but, unfortunately for all parties, this favoured youth is peculiarly dependent on his old and ungenerous rival. He is a brave lad, of humble birth, but with the advantage of having received a tolerable, though cheap, education in one of the northern counties; his friends had placed him under the patronage of the Admiral, who had freely pro|mi&s;ed, and had &s;incerely intended, to make his fortune. He had only rated him as a common &s;ailor in his &s;hip, but con&s;tantly employed him as his &s;ecretary; an office he executed with great in|telligence, and in which he had not lo&s;t oppor|tunities of &s;ignalizing his courage. By his &s;en&s;e,
<PB N="237" REF="239">
&s;pirit, and affectionate alacrity, he had made him&s;elf the prime favourite of the Admiral. In a po&s;t &s;o expo&s;ed to envy and ill-will, the engaging manners of Edward Mon&s;on &s;till rendered him univer&s;ally beloved; &s;o far was he from being deemed unworthy of the high favour he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that many per&s;ons thought him entitled to &s;upe|rior rank, and &s;uppo&s;ed, but erroneou&s;ly, from his having the graceful air of a gentleman and an officer, that he was the natural &s;on of his patron, In the eyes of the tender and di&s;cerning Caroline, he &s;eemed worthy of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction; and &s;he &s;oon give him, what he probably thought &s;u|perior to all naval honours, the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her virgin heart. The mo&s;t exqui&s;ite enjoyments are generally loaded with immoderate taxes, and De&s;tiny mingled for poor Mon&s;on a cup of honey and gall. As &s;oon as the mortified old Admiral di&s;covered the amorous triumph of his &s;ecretary, all his &s;plenetic &s;oul was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the demons of jealou&s;y, hatred, and revenge: he was con|verted at once from a generous patron, into a mercile&s;s tyrant, and implacable per&s;ecutor. His &s;tation gave him every advantage again&s;t his de|fencele&s;s young rival that a ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ion could wi&s;h, and he exerted the&s;e advantages with a mean ferocity di&s;graceful to human nature. Un|der frivolous or fal&s;e pretences, he condemned the once-favoured Mon&s;on, now the object of his abhorrence and his envy, to corporal puni&s;hment and rigorous confinement. The tender Caroline, in reaching her native land, where &s;he had fondly promi&s;ed her&s;elf the full enjoyment of liberty and love, was reduced to the mi&s;ery of leaving the
<PB N="238" REF="240">
man &s;he adored &s;ecluded from her &s;ight, and &s;uf|fering that ruthle&s;s oppre&s;&s;ion which his attach|ment to her had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>I never was more affected in my life than by the touching de&s;cription which the charming girl gave me of her extreme agony in quitting the &s;hip where her lover was impri&s;oned. She was obliged to fellow the fortunes of her &s;ick ma&s;ter and her foreign mi&s;tre&s;s; they both died within a twelve-month from the time of their reaching England; and a providential &s;eries of incidents threw the de&s;olate Caroline into the &s;ervice, or I &s;hould ra|ther &s;ay under the protection, of my tender-hearted Cornelia. The cruel and furious old Admiral has had, in the mean time, the infernal gratification of per&s;ecuting, his helple&s;s rival dur|ing a long and di&s;tant cruize, from which he is lately returned. Poor Mon&s;on &s;till continues his &s;lave and his captive: but I have already taken &s;ome mea&s;ures to re&s;tore the brave lad to freedom; and I hope &s;oon to enliven you with an account of their &s;ucce&s;s. I can only add to this letter a few more particulars that relate to this intere&s;ting girl. Upon my a&s;king her, if her per&s;ecuted lover did not contrive to write to her after &s;he landed; "O yes," &s;he replied with an impa&s;&s;ioned &s;impli|city, "nothing but his precious letters could have kept me alive; and he has a faithful friend in a young lieutenant of his &s;hip, who was &s;o good as to &s;end me his letters by every po&s;&s;ible opportuni|ty." "May I, my good Caroline," &s;aid I in re|turn, "may I without impertinence a&s;k to &s;ee one love-letter from this brave injured lad, whom you have taught me to e&s;teem? and will you have the
<PB N="239" REF="241">
goodne&s;s to &s;hew me the very letter (I will a&s;k only for one) which you peru&s;ed with mo&s;t plea|&s;ure?" "Dear Sir," replied the grateful Caro|line, "after all you have done and &s;uffered to &s;ave me from that barbarous old ruffian, I &s;hould be a thankle&s;s wretch indeed to refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e you &s;uch a reque&s;t." At there words &s;he &s;lipt her finger and thumb within the folds of a thick mu&s;lin hand|kerchief, and pulled from her bo&s;om a neat little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of blue &s;attin, which was &s;u&s;pended from her neck, by a very narrow ribband of the &s;ame colour. "Here," &s;aid &s;he with a deep &s;igh, "here is one letter of my poor Edward, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I think it my duty to wear upon my heart both by day and night; that I may retain the fuller &s;en&s;e of all his &s;uffer|ings for me, and con&s;tantly pray to GOD to ble&s;s me with the opportunity of making him all the amends that fidelity and affection can make. You may read this, Sir, &s;he continued; but I &s;hould tell you, the old barbarian only kept him in clo&s;e confinement while my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were on board his &s;hip; but, after we landed, he was wicked enough to have him inhumanly whipt be|fore the ma&s;t. You will &s;ee how bravely he bore it," &s;he added, dropping a tear as &s;he entru&s;ted the letter on my hand.</P>
<P>I received with eagerne&s;s this highly valued epi&s;tle, which had been unfolded &s;o often that it was almo&s;t in pieces. Poor Edward is, in my opinion, much more of a true hero than his ba&s;e commander.</P>

<P>JOY! Joy! my dear Lucy! let me pour into your &s;ympathetic bo&s;om &s;ome portion of that overflowing joy in which every creature of

this &s;eems to be almo&s;t overwhelmed. How fre|quently and fervently do I wi&s;h you were with us, that you might completely &s;hare the tender jubilee that now reigns in this man&s;ion, where every wall &s;eems to re-echo the triumphant &s;ounds.</P>
<Q>None but the brave de&s;erve the fair!</Q>
<P>Let not your quick imagination, however, conclude from this burthen of our &s;ong, that your friend Seymour is married to Cornelia. The &s;prightly words of Dryden are certainly applicable to them; but at pre&s;ent they are ap|plied more directly to a happy pair of inferior &s;tation, in who&s;e tran&s;ports you will take an intere&s;t as lively as I do, and the more &s;o as their happine&s;s is the noble work of Seymour&punc; How you would have wept with delight, my good tender-hearted girl, had you &s;een what we have &s;een!</P>
<P>But I will give you a brief hi&s;tory of the la&s;t delightful three days. On Tue&s;day I was made happy by the return of my dear Audley, accompanied by my father, both in high health and &s;pirits: my joy at the &s;ight of them was in|crea&s;ed not a little by the affectionate encomiums which they both be&s;towed on my conduct during the ab&s;ence of my lord. As he, you know, is always peculiarly alert in the &s;ervice of his friends, he re&s;olved to &s;et out the next morning on a vi&s;it to the wounded Seymour; and, after a little gentle raillery on our tender widow, he &s;ettled it for us all to remove to her man&s;ion,
<PB N="244" REF="246">
and thus a&s;&s;i&s;t her, with due decorum, in pay|ing tho&s;e attentions to the champion of her ca&s;tle, which &s;he certainly wi&s;hes to pay. I thought I di&s;covered that the dear dainty creature was half-plea&s;ed and half-embarra&s;&s;ed by the fir&s;t &s;ound of this project; but &s;he ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded to it very cor|dially. We all arrived here ye&s;terday about noon, and had the comfort of finding our wound|ed hero ju&s;t in that &s;tate which renders him pe|culiarly intere&s;ting, without giving us any alarm for his life. As he was not permitted to dine with us, our little party, at the reque&s;t of my good Audley, paid him the compliment of drink|ing tea with him in his own apartment. What a ze&s;t does a little mixture of pity give both to love and to friend&s;hip! I confe&s;s, for my own part, that I never thought this agreeable fellow half &s;o engaging as in his pre&s;ent pall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d condi|tion; and as to our poor C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnelia, &s;he had &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s in her countenance, while &s;he li&s;tened to the various hi&s;tory which our hero gave us of his adventures, that I con|ceive the &s;of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> widow of Carthage to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een an ab&s;olute &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to her. In &s;erious truth, my dear girl, we were all charmed with our evening; and Seymour related the late intere&s;ting occur|rences, in which he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had &s;o important a part, with &s;uch &s;pirit, grace, and even mode&s;ty, that we could all, I believe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve li&s;tened to him with plea&s;ure during the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le cour&s;e of the night, had not &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> countenance, and at la&s;t in his voice, given us a &s;ignal to retire.</P>

<P>As my father had not &s;een the late improve|ments in this charming &s;pot, he and Audley breakfa&s;ted very early together, and immediately after it &s;allied forth for a long ride. Cornelia, under the guard of your humble &s;ervant and her elde&s;t &s;on, ventured to place her breakfa&s;t-table in the apartment of the wounded knight, who had petitioned mo&s;t eagerly for this indulgence. In a few minutes after the tea-things were &s;ent out, and while Seymour was ingeniou&s;ly holding us his captives, as it were, by a fa&s;cinating de|&s;cription of &s;ome incidents at Genoa, and the filial virtues of Giuliana, we were &s;urpri&s;ed by the ha&s;ty entrance of Caroline. She appeared with a wild April face, full of &s;miles and tears; and, in&s;tead of apologizing for her intru&s;ion, exclaimed, "Here he is, Sir, and cannot re&s;t without the liberty of ble&s;&s;ing our noble delive|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">!"

who&s;e feet Cornelia and I were &s;tanding, he &s;eized and ki&s;&s;ed the hand of Seymour; but, in attempting to &s;peak, bur&s;t into tears, "My brave Mon&s;on, cried Seymour with a joyful quickne&s;s, you are of all men living the man I mo&s;t wi&s;hed to &s;ee; but do I &s;ee you perfectly free? have you got your di&s;charge?" The &s;tranger could not reply; but continued to kneel, and pre&s;s the hand he held in an agony of gratitude. "Ri&s;e, ri&s;e, my good friend," &s;aid Seymour, who began to be much affected; "you over rate my little &s;ervices." "Good heaven! cried the lover of Caroline, &s;tarting up, is it po&s;&s;ible for any human being to owe more to another than I owe to you? No, Sir, my whole life, devoted to your &s;ervice, could not thank you &s;ufficiently!

The &s;cene melted us all into &s;ilent tears; and Seymour wept as plentifully as your humble &s;ervant, or even the more tender-hearted Cornelia her&s;elf; but he made the fir&s;t effort to &s;ubdue his emotion, and &s;aid with a plea&s;ant vivacity to Mon&s;on,
<PB N="247" REF="249">
"Well, my good friend, &s;ince the old Admiral has behaved hand&s;omely at la&s;t, we will forgive him for all the pain he has made us undergo: he is a gallant fellow; and it is no little proof of his heroi&s;m, let me tell you, that he has &s;pirit enough to &s;end &s;uch a fine lad as you are to the beautiful girl whom he would willingly give his whole fortune to po&s;&s;e&s;s. But what &s;aid he to my letter?" "O, I a&s;k your pardon, &s;aid the happy bewildered Mon&s;on, here is his an&s;wer." He now delivered an epi&s;tle to Sey|mour, which Cornelia and I confe&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t ardent curio&s;ity to peru&s;e; but our hero, who had, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome private rea&s;ons for not gratifying our vi&s;ible wi&s;hes on this point, &s;oon gave us a much higher gratification, by &s;hewing us what his princely &s;pirit had for &s;ome time pro|jected, to complete the happine&s;s of this inte|re&s;ting couple. De&s;iring Cornelia to give him his pocket-book, which had been laid on the mantle-piece, he &s;aid, as he opened it, "My dear Mon&s;on, though your grateful &s;pirit thinks it&s;elf highly obliged to me, yet in fact, if my zeal to &s;erve you &s;topt here, I may have done you, perhaps, more harm than good; for, by ob|taining your di&s;charge, I have certainly taken you from a noble profe&s;&s;ion, and left you with|out the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: it is a duty that I owe both to you and to our country, whom I have robbed of a gallant &s;ailor, to provide for you in &s;ome other line, and render you a u&s;eful and happy member of &s;ociety. I am perfectly acquainted with your circum&s;tances, and your re&s;olution to marry the truly de&s;erving Caroline

I think, in point of di&s;cretion, you cannot marry too &s;oon; not &s;o much to &s;ecure your bride, who&s;e fidelity neither fraud nor force can &s;ubdue, but to prevent this odd furious old man, who&s;e peace and honour we would both with to con&s;ult, from relap&s;ing into his amorous frenzy. Let me advi&s;e you, therefore, as a friend, to marry immediately; and, that my advice may not appear more an in&s;ult than a kindne&s;s, you mu&s;t allow me to furni&s;h you with this immediate provi&s;ion, till we can find an opportunity of &s;ettling you in &s;ome eligible employment."</P>
<P>After this friendly and delicate addre&s;s to pre|pare the young &s;tranger for what might oppre&s;s him, Seymour gave him a paper: and what think you, my dear Lucy, it contained?

I &s;hall never forget the face of Mon&s;on in the moment he perceived its value. A&s;toni&s;hment, gratitude, pain, and even indignation, were all vi&s;ible in his features. "No, Sir, exclaim|ed the high-&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted youth, though I adore you for your genero&s;ity, I mu&s;t not receive it.

obligation from any man, without the &s;hadow of de&s;erving it." At the&s;e words he held the pa|per towards me. You will gue&s;s that I caught it with no little eagerne&s;s; and he added, with a &s;up|plicating and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed countenance, "Teach me, dear madam, how I ought to behave towards &s;o noble, &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a friend." "You are quite mi&s;taken, my good Mon&s;on," cried Seymour, "I am &s;o far from being a di&s;inte|re&s;ted friend to you, that in this bu&s;ine&s;s I am the mo&s;t intere&s;ted being imaginable. I will convince you, in a moment, that you will con|fer a much higher obligation upon me by ac|cepting this &s;um, that I can upon you in be&s;tow|ing it.

<Q>Here's room for meditation e'en to madne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent trouble is the more bitter, becau&s;e the prelude to it was a &s;cene of the pure&s;t plea|&s;ure that I ever experienced. I mu&s;t begin by telling you, that ye&s;terday happened to be the birth-day of the elde&s;t Sedley. Seymour, who is pa&s;&s;ionately fond of this charming boy, re|que&s;ted that the day might be celebrated with pe|culiar fe&s;tivity; and that, to render it a double jubilee, it might be fixed for the wedding-day of Mon&s;on and Caroline; my father, who ex|ults in all fe&s;tivity that carries a religious &s;anction along with it, not only joined in the reque&s;t, but de&s;ired to have the plea&s;ure of uniting this lovely couple: you will believe this bu&s;ine&s;s was readily adju&s;ted without a di&s;&s;entient, or even a he&s;itating voice; for Caroline, though truly mode&s;t, has not a grain of prudery in her com|po&s;ition. Seymour, who was recovered enough to attend the ceremony, which was performed in the chapel here, acted as father to the bride, with his u&s;ual elegance of manners; and vi&s;ibly felt emotions, not inferior to tho&s;e of a real parent on the occa&s;ion. Here I wi&s;hed not a little for you, my dear Lucy; for, as you think a wedding where youth and beauty are united,
<PB N="260" REF="262">
with genuine affection, a very touching drama, you mu&s;t have &s;hed many delicious tears had you been with us: there was no creature pre&s;ent but our&s;elves, and five &s;ervants of the family: my father read t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ervice with peculiar energy and feeling, and the whole &s;cene was conducted with &s;uch devout decency, and univer&s;al delight, that for my part I wept, I believe, from one end of it to the other: how poor Cornelia was affected I really cannot tell you, for &s;he very ingeniou&s;ly contrived to conceal her face the whole time; but &s;he did not e&s;cape from the chapel without a vi&s;ible crim&s;on blu&s;h, which the tender Caroline very innocently occa&s;ioned. The gentlemen, as u&s;ual, paid their compliment to the bride; but, as &s;oon as Seymour had touched her lip, this charming girl, who is perfectly the child of nature, dropt on her knee, and, ki&s;&s;ing his hand, aid to him, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;implicity and gratitude, "May Heaven, Sir, &s;oon make you as happy as you have now made your two grateful dependents! I &s;hould de&s;erve to lo&s;e the hu&s;band you have given me, if I de|parted from the altar without uttering this pray|er of my heart." Mo&s;t of the party &s;miled at the native innocence and thankful en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgy of her devotion.

indeed that we could all &s;wallow a cup of Lethe, and entirely forget the evening of ye&s;terday. As &s;oon as I have fulfilled my promi&s;e of impart|ing to you in this pacquet the circum&s;tances that have rendered it &s;o dete&s;table, I &s;hall &s;trive with all my &s;pirit to bani&s;h them, not only from my own remembrance, but from that of our poor Cornelia, on who&s;e tender bo&s;om they have made the mo&s;t deep and cruel impre&s;&s;ion; an impre&s;|&s;ion which, if it is, as my father a&s;&s;erted, the provident work of Heaven, I mu&s;t not expect, and I &s;hould not wi&s;h, to era&s;e. But there is, as you and I have often agreed, a &s;everity in his doctrine, to which I cannot immediately &s;ub|&s;cribe. I was at fir&s;t, indeed, mo&s;t bitterly pro|voked again&s;t Seymour: he ought to have been more on his guard at &s;uch a time and in &s;uch a place; yet &s;uch are the particulars of the ca&s;e, that he &s;eems to me much more entitled to com|pa&s;&s;ion than to cen&s;ure, and cannot help think|ing it a barbarous fatality that made him wretch|ed ju&s;t at the &s;ea&s;on when the beneficent exer|tion of his many virtues had given him the fair|e&s;t title to happine&s;s. It was the mo&s;t trifling circum&s;tance imaginable that produced all the mi&s;chief. You know, my father is no enemy to moderate fe&s;tivity; or, as your brother &s;aid of him, he has a true prie&s;tly reli&s;h for an or|thodox bottle. As our ill fortune would have it, he chanced, two days before our humble wed|ding, to commend before Seymour &s;ome very rich and rare wine; its name I forget; it is not <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kay.</HI> Seymour recollected that he had a little &s;tore of it in his cellar, which a foreign am|ba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="263" REF="265">
had pre&s;ented to his father; and he in|&s;tantly re&s;olved to produce a hamper of it at the wedding-dinner, and to honour the birth-day of the dear little Sedley. We all exclaimed again&s;t it as an impo&s;&s;ibility; it could not arrive in time; no matter, it mu&s;t be attempted: you know the foible of our hero; his ardent &s;pirit pur&s;ues even a &s;portive whim of his fancy, as if it was a point on which the &s;afety of an em|pire depended. His favourite &s;ervant was &s;ent off, and commanded to return with a hamper in a po&s;t-chai&s;e by the time appointed. The fellow travelled day and night; but you know the great di&s;tance of Seymour's country-&s;eat from this hou&s;e. The expected wine did not arrive for the capital toa&s;ts after dinner; yet in the univer&s;al joy of the day it was hardly regretted. The evening came, and we were all &s;ober and happy, though the gentlemen &s;eemed a little elated by what they had drank. Cornelia, how|ever, had drawn them from their bottles to her tea-table, to which, at my particular de&s;ire, the bride and bridegroom were admitted, for I was &s;olicitous to &s;ave the mode&s;t Caroline from that jocular and coar&s;e fe&s;tivity which I knew would prevail in the lower part of the hou&s;e: as it was, my father put her once out of countenance be|fore us; it is &s;trange that old men are always on the&s;e occa&s;ions more gro&s;s than young ones. Here, I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, our fa|vourite Seymour appeared to great advantage. His conver&s;ation, though very lively, was deli|cate in the extreme; and thus far, indeed, it was a day of delight. It was now late in the
<PB N="264" REF="266">
evening; but, ju&s;t as the tea-table was removed, and preparation was making for a quiet game of cards, the fatal hamper arrived. Seymour in|&s;tantly exclaimed, Come, Doctor, you &s;hall drink the health of the day in your favourite wine. Come, Mon&s;on, it would be barbarous to pin a bridegroom to a card-table, e&s;pecially as it is high time for the ladies to begin undre&s;&s;ing the bride. We will leave them to that ceremo|ny, and drink to the general joy of the whole hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e below." With this fe&s;tive exclamation he carried off my father to his wine, leading al&s;o young Sedley in his hand. He promi&s;ed Cornelia, however, that he would only &s;uffer the child to have a gla&s;s of the new wine, and re&s;tore him in&s;tantly to her care; a promi&s;e which he performed very faithfully, and in per|&s;on imprinting a ki&s;s on the fair hand of the parent, in placing the charming but tired and &s;leepy boy on her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Would to Heaven he had taken as good care of him&s;elf! My heart felt a melancholy pre|&s;age in the very moment when he &s;eized my fa|ther by the arm, and I gave my hu&s;band a cau|tion to watch over them b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th; which he would certainly have done, had not a mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable accident called him from the party. The happy Mon&s;on, who is as temperate as he is brave, could not be tempted beyond a &s;econd gla&s;s; after which, in &s;pite of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eir raillery, he &s;tole away to the arms of his expecting Caroline. In a few minutes after he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t the company, my dear Audley was mo&s;t unluckily intreated by the old Butler to terminate a fooli&s;h quarrel between
<PB N="265" REF="267">
one of our &s;ervants and one of Cornelia's. This idle fray detained him much longer than he was aware, and on his return to the parlour he found Seymour and my father both flu&s;hed with wine, and both &s;till more heated by argument, with the large Family Bible lying open between them; my father venting his indignation with great vehemence again&s;t the prophanene&s;s of Seymour; and Seymour playing numerous and unutterable tricks of impious buffoonery. In vain did my dear Audley endeavour to put them into good humour with each other, and get them quietly to bed. Finding this impracticable, he con|ceived a de&s;perate project, of which you will hardly think him capable, but for which you will give him the more credit. This was, to make the two di&s;putants completely drunk, that they might entirely forget what they had uttered again&s;t each other, and lo&s;e every trace of their religious di&s;&s;ention. He &s;ays, he thought him|&s;elf &s;upremely politic in this &s;cheme, and was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tered with a momentary gleam of &s;ucce&s;s; but Seymour, by an unfortunate allu&s;ion to the marriage in Cana, rekindled the furious zeal of my father, who, after uttering the bittere&s;t re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ike to the young intoxicated infidel, quitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e room in a tempe&s;t of pious indignation.

this! the different &s;cenes of it are &s;o deeply im|pre&s;&s;ed on my mind, that I think they can ne|ver depart from my memory as long as I exi&s;t; and they will frequently appear as actually pa&s;|&s;ing before me. But you are impatient for the &s;equel. Well; after a little pau&s;e, and a few deep &s;ighs, I will proceed.</P>
<P>Cornelia and I had ju&s;t attended the lovely bride to her chamber. We had received her la&s;t maidenly adieu! and left the charming agi|tated gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l in a &s;weet di&s;order of tremors, tender|ne&s;s, and tears. From her room we had retired to that of Cornelia, where in two little beds on each &s;ide her own, and under one canopy, her beautiful boys lay, like two little angels, a&s;leep. Our lovely friend, who&s;e tender nerves had been much affected in taking leave of Caroline, &s;eat|ed her&s;elf at the feet of her bed, and looked, as I was &s;aucy enough to tell her, like a more hap|le&s;s heroine de&s;cribed by Rowe,
<Q>Warm, tender, full of wi&s;hes.</Q>
While I was rallying the gentle creature on her pa&s;&s;ion for Seymour, and the great chance he would have of &s;ucce&s;s if he could pre&s;s her to an immediate marriage at that moment; while the dear candid &s;oul more than half confe&s;&s;ed that I was right in reading the emotions of her heart; the door &s;uddenly opened upon us, and in ru&s;hed my father, to warn the mi&s;tre&s;s of the man&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t harbouring &s;uch an impious wretched as Seymour under her roof</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="269">Think, my dear Lucy, what I endured at this moment; and paint to your&s;elf the &s;weet countenance of our Cornelia, changing at once from the &s;oft expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s, love, and hope, to the troubled looks of &s;urprize, remor&s;e, and de&s;pair. I endeavoured to hurry my father from her chamber; but he was not in a mood to be either wheedled or controuled. He was certainly a little inflamed by wine; yet his fa|culties were rather quickened than impaired; and though he &s;poke with great au&s;terity again&s;t the favourite object of our wi&s;hes, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I never heard him &s;o eloquent in my life&punc; He told Cornelia that, after the horrid bla&s;phe|mies to which he had been witne&s;s below, he &s;hould think him&s;elf deficient in his duty to earth and heaven, if he failed to caution her again&s;t the peril in which he &s;aw her involved. He then repre&s;ented the dangers of marrying a young man of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, without a par|ticle of religion, with &s;uch vehemence of lan|guage, and force of imagery, that for my part I felt a cold horror &s;trike through me, and poor Cornelia was thrown into &s;obs and tears.</P>
<P>When he perceived her weeping, he grew in|finitely gentler in his manner, and, folding her hand within his, &s;aid, with a parental emotion, "I pity you from my &s;oul: I &s;ee to what ex|ce&s;s you love this alluring, this pernicious in|fidel. And how could you do otherwi&s;e than love him? He is the mo&s;t &s;educing of mortals&punc; a man in who might ea&s;ily tempt half your &s;ex to make them&s;elves the greate&s;t of wretches!

of character we have a right to expect from you. I will not argue the matter as a point of rea&s;on and judgment; but con&s;ult the be&s;t feel|ings of &s;en&s;ibility; look at the&s;e little monitors (pointing to her children) and a&s;k your own bo&s;om if any partiality, any pa&s;&s;ion, however founded on the mo&s;t dazzling of human attrac|tions, can ju&s;tify you to your own heart, if you give to the&s;e innocents for their example, their guide, their father, an ab&s;olute mon&s;ter of im|piety." The feeling mother was almo&s;t &s;uffo|cated by her tears on this pointed addre&s;s to her maternal character. Perceiving that &s;he had no power to &s;peak, and wi&s;hing (to own the truth) that &s;he &s;hould not find an opportunity, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould utter &s;ome precipitate re&s;olution, for which we might all be &s;orry in a cooler moment; I ventured to argue with my father, at the im|minent hazard of enraging him &s;till more, in behalf of the dear abominable delinquent. I &s;aid, it was cruel to let a few words, however impious, uttered by an intoxicated man, cancel the merit of actions, not only &s;plendid in point of genero&s;ity and courage, but di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the true &s;pirit of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;tian charity. In &s;hort, I was told in the defence of poor Sey|mour, and did ample and affectionate ju&s;tice to tho&s;e virtues by which he has rai&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o high in our e&s;teem. My father heard me with a degree of temper and patience that I did not expect. He did not once interrupt me; but He &s;aid, as &s;oon as I pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed; "My dear Harriot, I do not blame you for looking with a fond and enthus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c admiration on the noble and cap|tivating

accompli&s;hments of this dangerous Sey|mour; but, tru&s;t me, to marry a young man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the&s;e attractions, and hiding under them a deep ma&s;s of impiety, is exactly like building a delightful palace in the tempting neighbourhood of Ve&s;uvio. For a while you may be charmed with your &s;ituation; the air is delicious, the pro&s;pect enchanting; but a &s;udden and unexpected bur&s;t of the latent fire converts the gay re&s;idence of delu&s;ive &s;ecurity into a &s;cene of the mo&s;t terrific deva&s;tation, Believe me, there is nothing in the human cha|racter, on which it is &s;afe to build, but the &s;olid rock of Religion." Encouraged by the mild|ne&s;s with which my father had li&s;tened to me before, I attempted to moderate in &s;ome degree the au&s;terity and intolerance of this maxim. By this attempt I unluckily rekindled his indigna|tion; and he &s;aid to me in a very &s;evere tone, "Harriot, you are the la&s;t per&s;on in the world who ought to appear as an advocate for Irreligion; have the gratitude and the decency to recollect, that all the rare happine&s;s of your own life ari&s;es from my having given you a man of genuine piety for your hu&s;band." Then turning to Cornelia, he &s;aid, "Madam, you know how ardently I love my child: yet, I prote&s;t to you before God, I would rather have &s;een her &s;ink into the grave in all the bloom of her youth and beauty, than I would have be&s;towed her on &s;uch a character as I am now endeavouring to caution you again&s;t." He added a &s;hort, but impa&s;&s;ioned prayer, that his caution might
<PB N="270" REF="272">
prove effectual; and then, giving us both his benediction, retired for the night.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were alone, our lovely friend fell upon my neck, and wept mo&s;t bitterly. She could not yet &s;peak, but gra&s;ped my hand with the vehemence of a poor creature in agonies of pain. There was at this time a conflict in her heart and &s;oul, more excruciating, perhaps, than any malad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the body. She traver&s;ed her chamber with an agitated &s;tep; pau&s;ed, look|ed at her children, wept, and walked again. I tried to &s;ooth her by making light of what had pa&s;&s;ed; by repre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enting it as a fooli&s;h di&s;pute over a bottle, that would be utterly forgot the next day; but the lovely angel rebuked me with a look of di&s;plea&s;ure, and exclaimed, "No, my dear Harriot, you mu&s;t not any longer flat|ter and confirm me in this criminal attachment. I do not vainly &s;trive to hide from you with what exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion I love Seymour at this mo|ment. Yes, I love him with that frenzy, that, if only the Perdition of my own &s;oul was hazard|ed by our union, perhaps I could not reject him; but for the&s;e dearer &s;ouls"&mdash;Here &s;he ca&s;t her eyes again upon the &s;weet &s;leeping boys; her voice was &s;u&s;pended; but falling on her knee, at the feet of her own bed, &s;o that &s;he had an equal view of the two children, and rai&s;ing to Heaven, perhaps, the mo&s;t beaut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful and impa&s;&s;ioned countenance that ever looked up to its Creator, &s;he &s;aid, with a trembling voice, "By the Al|mighty God who gave me the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ble&s;&s;ed infants, and by the dear &s;aint who&s;e dying injunction com|mended them to my duty, I &s;wear that no tempta|tions

&s;hall induce me to make the impious Sey|mour their &s;econd father. I will never marry again." The la&s;t words &s;he pronounced in a firmer and even a triumphant accent, for they were the dictates of duty and pa&s;&s;ion united. To &s;acrifice the man &s;he doated on to Heaven was a re&s;olve, which, though her mind was firm in its purpo&s;e, her lips could hardly utter; but to re|nounce all the &s;ex in honor of this dear victim, was a fond idea in which her heart exulted; it was granting, under the ma&s;k and yet with the &s;anction of duty, a &s;econdary triumph to Love</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Lucy, do you not &s;hudder at the thought of what our poor lovely friend mu&s;t have to endure, either in keeping, or in violating this precipitate vow? For my part, I have the auda|city, and I know, my good girl, you will &s;up|port me in it, &s;till to profe&s;s my&s;elf an advocate for this abominable offender. I cannot bear the idea of his being utterly renounced; and I main|tain that not only Love and Friend&s;hip, but Re|ligion it&s;elf ought to induce us all not to irritate and abandon, but to &s;oothe him, and labour for his conver&s;ion. If we &s;ucceed, and from the gentle, firm, and per&s;ua&s;ive &s;pirit of my dear Audley, I have great hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, the ha&s;ty vow of our dear righteous widow becomes void of cour&s;e; we &s;hall &s;till be happy, and our happine&s;s will be truly coele&s;tial. I endeavoured to calm our dear Cornelia, by talking to her in this &s;train as &s;oon as &s;he had fini&s;hed her adjuration; and, troubled as her &s;pirit was, it did not turn with abhorrence from this kind of con&s;olation. See, my dear Lucy, how well it is for a tender &s;crupulous &s;weet

&s;oul, like our Cornelia, to have &s;uch kind con|&s;iderate commentators at her elbow as you and I are, when &s;he is in the ra&s;h humour of vowing a vow! While I was admini&s;tering to her the com|fort which &s;he found in &s;eeing that her ha&s;ty pro|mi&s;e to Heaven was conditional, I heard a gentle tap at her door. Behold my hu&s;band; "For Heaven's &s;ake, &s;aid I, what have you done with Seymour? has not this fatal wine made him fran|tic?" "Be not alarmed, returned my good man, looking keenly on the anxious eager coun|tenance of Cornelia. He has, indeed, been a little di&s;gui&s;ed, by a &s;light exce&s;s in drinking: but this is not &s;urprizing after his recent low regi|men, and on &s;uch a day as this; his intemper|ance only proves the affectionate warmth of his heart; it is now time for us all to retire, as I have put him very peaceably to bed." "Excellent, cried I, in a tran&s;port of joy, and now we may all &s;leep in peace." In &s;aying this, I gave a &s;ig|nificant pre&s;&s;ure to the hand of Cornelia, and we both wi&s;hed her good night. And here, Lucy, I mu&s;t take leave of you al&s;o with the &s;ame good wi&s;h.

I have al|ready told you the project, my dear girl, which your incomparable brother has devi&s;ed for this purpo&s;e.

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>YOU, who are &s;o familiar with the pa&s;t fol|lies of my life, you, my dear Edmund, will not be &s;urprized to hear that I have again played the fool more dete&s;tably than ever. I have made my&s;elf a wretch; I have di&s;graced my&s;elf in the eyes of my adored Cornelia. I am no longer under her roof. I have committed&mdash;but why &s;hould I particularize my execrable offences to you, when you have probably learnt (by means of the women who write about every thing) more circum&s;tances of my mi&s;conduct than I know my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In fooli&s;h de&s;ire to ingratiate my&s;elf with that odious high prie&s;t Dr. Ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, who loves his bot|tle pontifically, I drank with him, on a double fe&s;tival that we have celebrated here, on the birth|day of the brave little Sedley, and the marriage of my &s;weet Caroline, till the Doctor lo&s;t his temper, and I my &s;en&s;es. All I can remember of the evening is, that we &s;puttered much pious and pro|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ane non&s;en&s;e in the face of each other. No|thing could be &s;o ab&s;urd; nothing &s;o ill-timed; n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thing &s;o injurious to my love, as this execrable contention. I loath the &s;ight of wine, and ab|hor my&s;elf for my folly. Yet I have found an apologi&s;t and a comforter, where I little expected, and le&s;s perhaps de&s;erved to find him; 'tis with peculiar &s;atisfaction that I add&mdash;<HI>in your Brother.</HI>
<PB N="276" REF="278">
He has kindly hurried me from a &s;cene where I have expo&s;ed and di&s;graced my&s;elf &s;o egregiou&s;ly, to his own tranquil man&s;ion; with a thoughtful good-nature that proved him really your brother. He &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that my be&s;t mode of apolo|gizing for what I mo&s;t bitterly repent, would be to withdraw for a few days, leaving only a conci|liatory me&s;&s;age for the per&s;ons who have the greate&s;t right to be offended by my gro&s;s indeco|rum. He ob&s;erved, that by thus giving the in|&s;ulted Divine &s;ufficient time to grow cool, I might probably induce him to forget our di&s;pute; and by &s;hewing Cornelia that I puni&s;h my&s;elf for my tran&s;g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ion towards her by tearing my&s;elf from her pre&s;ence, I &s;hould incline her to receive me with indulgence on my re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn. By the force of the&s;e friendly rea&s;ons, your brother drew me to his hou&s;e; we have now been under his roof the better part of two days alone, and during that time his ince&s;&s;ant attention and kind behaviour to me have been &s;uch, that I cannot more &s;trongly expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of it to you, than by telling you the words I addre&s;&s;ed to him a few minutes ago, on our clo&s;ing a private conference of &s;ome hours.

I reverence, indeed, his ardent philanthropy, and I admire his happi|ne&s;s, which is, as I freely allowed him, &s;uperior to what you and I have ever enjoyed, or may ever attain; but this, which he a&s;cribes to his Religion, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the kind work of Nature; it is owing to the con&s;titutional equipoi&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ions, and the peculiar felicity of his temper.

<P>At the in&s;tigation of that rigid and angry prie&s;t whom I have fooli&s;hly made my enemy, &s;he may perhaps reject me for ever&mdash; reject the very man to whom &s;he is, in truth, attached by affection, by gratitude, and every hone&s;t emotion of her frame. My &s;oul is in tumult at this idea! I am con&s;cious that I have de&s;erved to experience &s;ome little portion of her anger. I want no Go&s;pel to tell me, that intoxication is a bea&s;tly failing. I am ready to purcha&s;e her forgivene&s;s, by re|nouncing intemperance for ever; but I have too much noble pride to purcha&s;e even her per&s;on, though it is the only jewel in the world to my ap|prehen&s;ion, by making my&s;elf either a fool or a hypocrite. We return to morrow. How &s;he will receive me I know not: but if &s;he treats me with a coldne&s;s and di&s;dain which I am &s;ure are foreign to her nature, I feel it may drive me to di&s;traction.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI. FROM MR. AUDLEY TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I TRUST that my la&s;t letter convinced you, my dear Edmund, how &s;incerely my heart is di&s;po&s;ed to promote the wi&s;hes of your engaging friend. His very failings have increa&s;ed my at|tachment to him, as they &s;hew me, that, with a &s;pirit peculiarly benevolent and generous to others, he is a mo&s;t dangerous enemy to him&s;elf. My dear Harriot, who really feels for him all the &s;o|licitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f a &s;i&s;ter, has given you, I conclude, a very melancholy detail of the fooli&s;h and provok|ing incidents they have produced a mo&s;t uncom|fortable change of &s;cene in the hou&s;e of Cornelia. I brought Seymour to pa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a few days with me in privacy, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der my own roof, for two rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, I was very de&s;irous to prevent the renewal, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to annihilate the memory, of a furious theological di&s;pute, which aro&s;e between him and Dr. Ayton, in a luckle&s;s night of intem|perate
<PB N="279" REF="281">
fe&s;tivity. Secondly, I cheri&s;hed a hope, that in the quiet of this &s;eque&s;tered &s;cene, and in many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive hours of unre&s;erved and friendly conver&s;ation, I might be fortunate enough to re|move from the mind of this intere&s;ting young man the only ob&s;tacle to his happine&s;s; I mean, that infidelity which &s;eems to have fa&s;tened on his &s;pirit, more from the power of accident than from any natural di&s;po&s;ition in his character to produce or maintain it. It is with the mo&s;t cordial concern I perceive, that my powers of ar|gument and per&s;ua&s;ion are too weak to accompli&s;h in your friend, my dear Edmund, as in you, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppy conver&s;ion which I mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to behold in you both. I have &s;earched as deeply as I could the &s;prings of incredulity in each of you; and I find that the&s;e &s;prings are very different; but, ala! they are equally powerful again&s;t my wi&s;h in your behalf. Rou&s;&s;eau, I think, has &s;aid, that the faith of mo&s;t men is regulated upon earth by their temporal intere&s;t. This, however, is by no means the ca&s;e with an Engli&s;h gentleman of independent fortune, who&s;e creed has little connexion with his temporal pro&s;perity, that many parents in this rank of like, while they teach worldly maxims to their children, think it unnece&s;&s;ary to burthen them with religious ideas. Thus young men are left to pick up &s;uch a religion as Time and Chance may happen to afford them. Their faith, of cour&s;e, will greatly depend on their early connexions in life, and &s;till more on their particular humours and pa&s;&s;ions. I think, my dear Edmund, that this remark is very &s;trongly exemplified in you and your friend
<PB N="280" REF="282">
Seymour: in you, as I have often told you, infi|delity is the offspring of a vitiated imagination: in Seymour, it is the child of an imperious pa&s;&s;ion, and, I fear, the firme&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, pride. It plea&s;ed Heaven to give you, with a &s;trong under|&s;tanding, a much greater propen&s;ity to ridicule and &s;arca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m than is commonly united to a heart &s;o tender as yours; the applau&s;e very ju&s;tly given to your early wit and humour augmented this dangerous pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pen&s;ity; thus your mind was allur|ed into the habit of con&s;idering even the mo&s;t &s;erious objects in a lud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crous point of view; your fir&s;t a&s;&s;ociates in the world were unfortu|nately men who trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Chri&s;tianity with deri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on; you were amu&s;ed in laughing with them, and plea&s;ed to increa&s;e their merriment by your &s;upe|rior vivacity. But as the fire of youth abated, your natural good &s;en&s;e, my dear Edmund, &s;oon taug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t you, on the&s;e articles, a great degree of caution and re&s;erve; you cea&s;ed to ridicule Re|ligion; but though prudence and good nature con&s;pired to make you de&s;i&s;t from a practice which you could not pur&s;ue without creating to your&s;elf many enemies, you could not correct the internal mi&s;chief which the habit, too long in|dulged, had impre&s;&s;ed upon your mind. You could, indeed, cea&s;e to ridicule Religion; but you could not cea&s;e to think Religion ridiculous. The bias given to your youthful fancy was too powerful for your rea&s;on, even in its maturity, to counteract; and how many men have we &s;een unable, in advanced life, to embrace the com|forts of genuine piety, from no other cau&s;e but the having been idly tempted to laugh at them in their youth! It is difficult in
<PB N="281" REF="283">
the highe&s;t degree to bring the human &s;pirit to contemplate with reverence what it has once been accu&s;tomed to treat with deri&s;ion; and as to your&s;elf, my dear Edmund, I am convinced, as I have often &s;aid to you, by my own ineffec|tual but affectionate endeavours to change the ca&s;t of your mind, that nothing but &s;ome great and unexpected calamity or &s;ickne&s;s; nothing, in &s;hort, but &s;ome &s;triking event, that may con|vul&s;e, as it were, like an earthquake, your whole bodily and intellectual frame, can take from your warped imagination that unfortunate bent which I have &s;o frequently lamented. With your friend Seymour I had flattered my&s;elf on a pro&s;pect of better &s;ucce&s;s: as his mind has not been &s;o much under the fa&s;cination of ridicule, I hoped to find it more open to Rea&s;on. I was willing to think that even his pa&s;&s;ions might act as my confede|rates; and that Love, which has &s;ettled, as you &s;portively &s;aid, the creed of many princes, might help me to make a happy convert of him; but Love, I find, in its warme&s;t exce&s;s, is a pa&s;&s;ion much weaker than Pride; at lea&s;t it proves &s;o in your friend. He doats upon Cornelia; but, with a firmne&s;s of proud incredulity which I both la|ment and admire, he will not purcha&s;e even the idol of his heart by what he con&s;iders a &s;acrifice of his own dignity as a man; nay, &s;o tenacious is he of imaginary honour in this point, that if my long and repeated conferences had really convert|ed him, he &s;ays he &s;hould be almo&s;t tempted to &s;uppre&s;s his belief at this juncture, le&s;t his friends &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that Love had made him an hypo|crite in Religion: &s;o vehement is his dete&s;tation to every &s;hadow of duplicity and fal&s;hood.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="284">It is impo&s;&s;ible not to love a character &s;o open, &s;o ingenuous, &s;o ardent, and &s;o firm, however deluded he may be: it is equally impo&s;&s;ible (at lea&s;t for a man who t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nks &s;eriou&s;ly of Religion), not to wi&s;h him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of only thing which can render his enchanting qualities no longer dan|gerous to him&s;elf. You, my dear brother, have both experience and di&s;cretion, I might even &s;ay timidity, in the conduct of life, to protect you again&s;t the perils of your own foibles and pa&s;&s;ions; but it is not &s;o with our friend: undi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gui&s;ed in all he thinks, and precipitate in all he does, he is peculiarly expo&s;ed to the malice of fortune; and the more I reflect on his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, the more I am alarmed for what is to come.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, he has reduced me to a mo&s;t un|comfortable dilemma: I cannot take an active part in oppo&s;ing his wi&s;hes, without wounding, not only my friend&s;hip for you, but tho&s;e &s;entiments of regard with which he has in&s;pired me for him&s;elf. Nor can I be very earne&s;t and deci&s;ive in promot|ing his hopes of marrying Cornelia, con&s;i&s;tently with my con&s;cience. I have the &s;incere&s;t good wi&s;hes to them both; I clearly perceive they are &s;o deeply enamoured of each other, that they mu&s;t be wretched a&s;under; yet, if they are united, there is a pro&s;pect of equal, and perhaps of &s;uperior wretchedne&s;s, from their unhappy difference&punc; the great article of Religion: an ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cle which the dying injunction of poor Sedley h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s rendered &s;o pecul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arly imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtant to Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elia, that I que&s;tion induce if Seymour, with the united powers of Love and Friend&s;hip, with his own attractions, and my recommendation (if I

dared to recommend him) could triumph, with|out a change in his creed, over the &s;crupulous piety of my lovely ward. I am almo&s;t convinced that &s;he would peri&s;h in tho&s;e wa&s;ting maladies which are apt to ari&s;e from vehement di&s;appoint|ed affection, much rather than gratify her heart by a violation of her duty; yet a woman, a tender, young, and impa&s;&s;ioned woman, is, we all know, a frail creature; and perhaps I ought to take the mo&s;t determinate &s;teps to secure the gentle being, bequeathed to my care, from a trial &s;o perilous and &s;evere.</P>
<P>I am truly bewildered by the various vexations, perplexities, and dangers on every &s;ide. I feel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owever, that my mind has gained &s;ome little re|lief in thus copiou&s;ly unburthening it&s;elf to you. I am &s;ure you will be ready to co-operate with me in what I mo&s;t wi&s;h at pre&s;ent, which is, to keep Seymour as quiet as po&s;&s;ible; any precipi|tate importunity in his addre&s;&s;es ju&s;t now would be very cruel to Cornelia, and mu&s;t, I think, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulvous to him&s;elf. He appears not a little affect|ed by the &s;incerity of my zeal for his happine&s;s, and he promi&s;es to be guided in a great mea&s;ure, as to his pre&s;ent conduct, by me; but I perceive the im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etuo&s;ity of his &s;pirit, and am perfectly aware that it will be very difficult to keep him from acting according to the &s;udden and acciden|tal impul&s;e of his imperious pa&s;&s;ion. As you are the only per&s;on in the world po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing long and confirmed influence over this impetuous youth, pray let your letters to him be per&s;ua&s;ive le&s;&s;ons of tranquillity and patience. By gaming time, we may do much for his good. I &s;hould tell you,
<PB N="284" REF="286">
he has made one generous and important con|ce&s;&s;ion; he has promi&s;ed, that, if he marries Cornelia, all her children &s;hall be educated as devoutly as &s;he and I may think proper. He will never interfere with the religion of his own wife or her family. He even thinks they may be much the happier for being good Chri&s;tians; yet, &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent are men, they will take no pains to eradicate from their own minds tho&s;e early habits and prejudices which have hardened them again&s;t a faith, who&s;e beneficial influence on the happi|ne&s;s of its true profe&s;&s;ors they candidly acknow|ledge.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD me, dear Edmund, re&s;tored to Sedley-hall; and my good genius him&s;elf &s;eemed to hail my return, in the &s;hape of a &s;er|vant, who informed me, as your brother and I alighted at the door, that Dr. Ayton is gone to London. I could not help exclaiming, in the words of Madeth,
<Q>Being gone, I am my&s;elf again.</Q>
In &s;ober truth, I greatly dreaded a &s;econd meet|ing with this &s;tiff piece of orthodox au&s;terity. I neither cho&s;e to play the &s;ervile penitent, or the hypocrite, with him; nor to let him play the in&s;olent &s;chool-ma&s;ter and tyrannical bigot with me. I thank my &s;tars, that the tidings of a tottering more have hurried him to the metro|poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that he may watch it as the witch does the drop on the corner of the moon, and "catch it ere it fall to the ground."</P>
<P>My dear indulgent Cornelia has received me with that graceful gentlene&s;s which is &s;o peculiar to her&s;elf; and &s;he made &s;o kind a reply to my repeated apology for my late tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that, as I told her, I felt the various pains that I have &s;uffered from my folly delightfully repaid in the &s;weetne&s;s of her pardon. There is indeed a de|licacy
<PB N="286" REF="288">
in the manners of Cornelia, which I never found in tho&s;e of any other woman, and which is the re&s;ult of her genuine, unaffected, and temperate &s;en&s;ibility. The whole &s;ex may, I think, be comprehended in two cla&s;&s;es, the live|ly and the &s;erious; the fir&s;t often overwhelm us by their vivacity, and the &s;econd by their gloom. But Cornelia is a perfect model of the true hap|py medium. Her gaiety is as mild and benig|nant as the &s;mile of an angel; and her melan|choly, in&s;tead of diffu&s;ing &s;adne&s;s, in&s;pires only tenderne&s;s and love. Such &s;he has appeared to me on the many, many reflections which I have made in various humours on this incomparable woman: yet I mu&s;t add with &s;orrow, that al|though her fir&s;t reception of me was enchant|ingly gracious, and perfectly like her&s;elf, in &s;ome moments &s;ince my return I have thought I perceived a new character creeping like a mi&s;t over her mind. Her native ea&s;e has now and then changed into a cold and &s;tately politene&s;s, that &s;truck like a falling i&s;icle on my bo&s;om, and &s;eemed both to lacerate and to petr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fy my heart. I could not help whi&s;pering to her, though there was company in the room, "If you treat me with an air of proud indifference, you will very &s;oon make a madman of me for life." I believe &s;he was both vexed and plea&s;ed by this intimation; it had certainly a happy influence on her b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">iour and my feelings; for &s;he never &s;poke to me afterwards but with &s;uch a &s;oftne&s;s of voice that the tones of it &s;unk into my &s;oul. Oh, Edmund, this dear delicious woman mu&s;t
<PB N="287" REF="289">
be mine, or my life will not be worth pre&s;erv|ing!</P>
<P>What has pa&s;&s;ed in our &s;hort ab&s;ence I have not yet learned; as I have only had a few en|couraging looks from my very good friend Mrs. Audley, and a brief exhortation from her not to be precipitate, but re&s;ign my&s;elf to Hope and Heaven. She is an indulgent kind creature; and &s;he has been, I under&s;tand, very warm in my defence, at the hazard of incurring her righ|teous father's di&s;plea&s;ure. Yet, much as &s;he is my friend, I cannot depend on her imparting to me explicitly all that I want to know. But I have one &s;ure channel of intelligence. As &s;oon as I can get my grateful Caroline alone, I am confident that her gratitude will induce her to reveal to me all the &s;ecrets of the female cabinet, to which I know &s;he is admitted. It is fortunate for me, that &s;he and her happy Mon&s;on are to return with us and the ladies to your brother's. He has kindly in&s;i&s;ted on carrying us all to his own ho&s;pitable man&s;ion to-morrow, where he expects to find a niece of Mrs. Audley's from Ireland, a lovely girl, they &s;ay, and wonderfully like Cornelia in form and &s;hape of her features, but not &s;o in the expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, &s;ince vivacity is the characteri&s;tic of one, and tenderne&s;s of the other. Mrs. Audley has been je&s;ting with me, concerning the beauties of her niece, and a de&s;ign, which &s;he &s;portively a&s;cribes to her, of making a conque&s;t of me. By Hea|ven, I thought that Cornelia, who overheard part of our di&s;cour&s;e without our intending it, turned pale at the &s;ound! O Venus ! if this &s;oft

<P>YOUR good-natured heart, my dear Lucy, will rejoice in being told that our cloudy pro&s;pect is grown wonderfully clearer; an un|expected incident has happened, which contri|butes not a little to our general ea&s;e and comfort, though I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to &s;peak of it, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you, as a &s;ource of &s;atisfaction; for the inci|dent I mean is the &s;udden departure of my father, who has been ha&s;tily &s;ummoned, by private bu&s;ine&s;s, to London.

My niece Loui&s;a is by this time at Audley Grove; and our whole party is to ad|journ to our hou&s;e, for the better reception of this charming &s;prightly girl, who has at length obtained the permi&s;&s;ion of her father to pa&s;s a few months with us.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letters, my dear Seymour, have acted as med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cine upon my &s;pirits in the cour&s;e of an illne&s;s into which I have relap&s;ed, and from which I am once more recovered. Sometimes indeed the medicine was too &s;trong for the patient; and at one period my anxiety for you, and my terrors of Dr. Ayton, con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the nervous fever, which has proved &s;uch an ob&s;tinate enemy to my health and comfort. But the high-prie&s;t's mo&s;t &s;ea&s;on|able departure, and the very cordial regard which I am now doubly a&s;&s;ured my brother has conceived for you, in&s;pire me with &s;alutary and enlivening hopes. I clearly perceive that the capricious Godde&s;s Good-fortune is ha&s;tening to embrace you, and complete your happine&s;s. Do not, I conjure you, in your impetuous eagerne&s;s to meet her, beat the fair Divinity backwards, and over&s;et all her intended bounty.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="294">You find me, as u&s;ual, &s;till ready to load you with cautionary coun&s;el; and in truth, my deare&s;t friend, I never knew any period in your event|ful life, where I &s;aw greater rea&s;on, or felt a more anvi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us de&s;ire, to throw a gentle curb over the native precipitancy of your &s;pirit.

and, in thus &s;ecuring your own happi|ne&s;s, you will make us all happy.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h that my good brother had been &s;ucce&s;sful in his very zealous endeavours for your conver&s;ion. Since it is otherwi&s;e, allow me to &s;ugge&s;t to your reflection how far it may be con|&s;i&s;tent, I will not &s;ay with prudence, for I know you de&s;pi&s;e that cold-blooded quality; but with love, honour, and genero&s;ity, to a&s;&s;ume an ap|pearance of that creed which your mi&s;tre&s;s and your friend have &s;o affectionately wi&s;hed to im|pre&s;s upon your mind. It is needle&s;s, I tru&s;t, to a&s;&s;ure you, that I have an abhorrence as vehe|ment as your own for all the arts of a &s;ordid and &s;elfi&s;h hypocri&s;y. But when di&s;&s;imulation is practi&s;ed for no purpo&s;e but to en&s;ure the tran|quility and happine&s;s of tho&s;e we love, it ought &s;urely to lo&s;e the name and character of ba&s;ene&s;s, and to be ranked among the noble&s;t of virtues; it is then that we may &s;peak of fal&s;hood in the &s;pi|rited language of Ta&s;&s;o, and ju&s;tly &s;ay,

<Q>Magnanimous fal&s;hood! when is truth &s;o beautiful as to merit the preference to thee!</Q></P>
<P>I quote an Italian poet, to &s;hew you that I have not utterly neglected your injunction con|cerning that language; though I reproach my&s;elf for not having learned it, as I ought to have done, in the happier days of Giuliana.</P>
<P>Were I in your &s;ituation, I &s;hould find a mar|vellous delight in cheri&s;hing &s;uch an affectionate illu&s;ion in the mind of my mi&s;tre&s;s. I &s;hould
<PB N="294" REF="296">
exult in per&s;uading her that &s;he had made me every thing &s;he wi&s;hed; how charming mu&s;t it be, to gratify the fond pride of her &s;oul in mak|ing her believe that by the tenderne&s;s which mini&s;tered to your earthly plea&s;ure &s;he was literal|ly leading you to Heaven! How exqui&s;ite mu&s;t the &s;oft features of your Cornelia appear, when animated with the mingled fire of triumphant piety and gratified affection! Tru&s;t me, my dear Seymour, tho&s;e happy rogues (whether hypo|crites or not) have had the keene&s;t enjoyment of women, who have had the art to mix Devo|tion with Love. I cannot &s;ay I have great hopes of your regarding my &s;ugge&s;tions to you on this &s;ubject; for I know yon have &s;uch a romantic attachment to truth, that you would rather make your&s;elf mi&s;erable for life, by adhering to it, than conde&s;cend t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be u&s;efully and even ge|nerou&s;ly deceitful. What a pity it is that the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate votaries are tho&s;e of imaginary virtue!</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily conceive how you would exult in rai&s;ing a little jealous apprehen&s;ion in the &s;oft bo&s;om of Cornelia; but have a care, my good friend; do not, by attempting to waken jealou&s;y in one tender heart, inadvertently throw an amorous flame into another. You are too dan|gerous a fellow to trifle with an artle&s;s and glow|ing girl of eighteen. Though Loui&s;a Mount|maurice, from the peculiar &s;prightline&s;s of her character, might be more able to defend her heart again&s;t your in&s;inuating attractions than the making Cornelia; yet pray remember that this niece of your good friend Harriot is com|po&s;ed,
<PB N="295" REF="297">
like the re&s;t of her &s;ex, of combu&s;tible atoms; and do not &s;uffer your Cupid to &s;hake his torch too near her. As to the advantages you &s;eem to expect from making Cornelia jea|lous, I have many doubts on that article: doubt, you know, is the characteri&s;tic of my mind, and deci&s;ion of yours. I think much evil might ari&s;e from it, and a con&s;equence directly oppo&s;ite to what your quick fancy has &s;ugge&s;ted. But I will not pe&s;ter you with all the thorny conjectures on a contingency that will hardly happen. I mu&s;t, however, inform you what your very zealous friend Lucy &s;ays on your idea; &s;he entreats you, whatever degree of plea&s;ure or influence you may expect to derive from it, ne|ver to pur&s;ue &s;o barbarous an expedient. She &s;ays, what I am convinced is &s;trictly true, that your fair-one's heart is already as entirely yours as Love can make it; and why &s;hould you cruel|ly fill it with agonies that cannot encrea&s;e its affection? Lucy goes &s;o far as to affirm, that your tender widow has not &s;trength of mind or body &s;ufficient to &s;upport the pangs of the mo&s;t e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">teruc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ating pa&s;&s;ion; and if you make her really jealous in the pre&s;ent perplexed &s;tate of her &s;pi|rits, you mu&s;t inevitably de&s;troy either her life or her &s;en&s;es. Though I do not quite &s;ub&s;cribe to this fearful idea of my &s;i&s;ter's, I cannot help joining her in conjuring you to be cautious. Be a&s;&s;ured, my deare&s;t friend, that if you will be but temperate and patient, if you will only al|low &s;ufficient time for that Love which is certain|ly the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of her &s;oul, to &s;ubdue and expel the terror that yet adheres to it, you
<PB N="296" REF="298">
will &s;oon make her your wife upon the terms that are mo&s;t agreeable to your own manly &s;pirit. I am appri&s;ed of the generous propo&s;als which you have made to my brother concerning the educa|tion of her children; and, tru&s;t me, both your queen and her hone&s;t privy-coun&s;ellor will (if you do not perplex them with your precipitancy) acquie&s;ce in this de&s;irable union, on the ground you propo&s;e. But their acquie&s;cence mu&s;t be the work of deliberation and of time. I will now relea&s;e you from this tedious lecture; but let me once more repeat our entreaty, for I &s;peak both in Lucy's name and my own, that you will not make your&s;elf wretched by too great an eager|ne&s;s to be happy.
