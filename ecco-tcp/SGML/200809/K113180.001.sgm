<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO tho&s;e who attentively con&s;ider the &s;ubject of Natural Hi&s;|tory, as di&s;played in the animal creation, it will appear, that though much has been done to explore the intricate paths of Nature, and follow her through all her various windings, much yet remains to be done before the great oeconomy is completely developed. Notwith&s;tanding the laborious and not un&s;ucce&s;s|ful inquiries of ingenious men in all ages, the &s;ubject is far from being exhau&s;ted. Sy&s;tems have been formed and explo|ded, and new ones have appeared in their &s;tead; but, like &s;ke|letons injudiciou&s;ly put together, they give but an imperfect idea of that order and &s;ymmetry to which they are intended to be &s;ub&s;ervient: They have their u&s;e, but it is the &s;kilful prac|titioner who is chiefly enabled to profit by them; to the le&s;s informed they appear ob&s;cure and perplexing, and too frequent|ly deter him from the great object of his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>To inve&s;tigate, with any tolerable degree of &s;ucce&s;s, the more retired and di&s;tant parts of the animal oeconomy, is a ta&s;k of no &s;mall difficulty. An inquiry &s;o de&s;ireable and &s;o eminently u&s;e|ful would require the united efforts of many to give it the de|&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. Men of lei&s;ure, of all de&s;criptions, re&s;iding in the country, could &s;carcely find a more delightful employment than
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
in attempting to elucidate, from their own ob&s;ervations, the va|rious branches of Natural Hi&s;tory, and in communicating them to others. Something like a &s;ociety in each county, for the purpo&s;e of collecting a variety of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, as well as for general corre&s;pondence, would be extremely u&s;eful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary: Much might be expected from a combination of this kind extending through every part of the kingdom; a general mode of communication might be thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed, in order to a&s;certain the changes which are continually taking place, par|ticularly among the feathered tribes; the times of their appear|ing and di&s;appearing would be carefully noted; the differences of age, &s;ex, food, &amp;c. would claim a particular degree of atten|tion, and would be the means of correcting a number of errors which have crept into the works of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent ornithologi&s;ts, and of avoiding the confu&s;ion ari&s;ing from an over-anxious de&s;ire of encrea&s;ing the numbers of each particular kind: But it is re&s;erved, perhaps, for times of greater tranquil|lity, when the human mind, undi&s;turbed by public calamities, &s;hall find lei&s;ure to employ it&s;elf, without interruption, in the pur&s;uit of tho&s;e objects which enlarge its powers and give dig|nity to its exertions, to carry into the fulle&s;t effect a plan for in|ve&s;tigations of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>In this re&s;pect no author has been more &s;ucce&s;sful than the celebrated Count de Buffon:&mdash;De&s;pi&s;ing the re&s;traints which methodical arrangements generally impo&s;e, he ranges at large through the various walks of Nature, and de&s;cribes her with a brilliancy of colouring which the mo&s;t lively imagination only could &s;ugge&s;t. It mu&s;t, however, be allowed, that in many in|&s;tances, that ingenious philo&s;opher has over&s;tepped the bounds of Nature, and, in giving the reins to his own luxuriant fancy, has been too frequently hurried into the wild paths of conjecture and romance. The late Mr White, of Selborne, has added much to the general &s;tock of knowledge on this delightful &s;ubject, by attentively and faithfully recording whatever fell un|der his own ob&s;ervations, and by liberal communications to others.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5">As far as we could, con&s;i&s;tently with the plan laid down in the following work, we have con&s;ulted, and we tru&s;t with &s;ome advantage, the works of the&s;e and other Naturali&s;ts. In the arrangement of the various cla&s;&s;es, as well as in the de&s;criptive part, we have taken as our guide our ingenious countryman, Mr Pennant, to who&s;e elegant and u&s;eful labours the world is in|debted for a fund of the mo&s;t rational entertainment, and who will be remembered by every lover of Nature as long as her works have power to charm. The communications with which we have been favoured by tho&s;e gentlemen who were &s;o good as to notice our growing work, have been generally acknowledged in their proper place; it remains only that we be permitted to in&s;ert this te&s;timony of our grateful &s;en&s;e of them.</P>
<P>In a few in&s;tances we have ventured to depart from the u&s;ual method of cla&s;&s;ification; by placing the hard-billed birds, or tho&s;e which live chiefly on &s;eeds, next to tho&s;e of the Pie kind, there &s;eems to be a more regular gradation downwards, a few anomalous birds, &s;uch as the Cuckoo, Hoopoe, Nuthatch, &amp;c. only intervening: The &s;oft-billed birds, or tho&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on worms, in&s;ects, and &s;uch like, are by this means pla|ced all together, beginning with tho&s;e of the Lark kind. To this we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, by dividing the various families of birds into two grand divi&s;ions, viz. Land and Water, a number of tribes have thereby been included among the latter, which can no otherwi&s;e be denominated Water Birds than as they oc|ca&s;ionally &s;eek their food in moi&s;t places, by &s;mall &s;treamlets, or on the &s;ea-&s;hore; &s;uch as the Curlew, Woodcock, Snipe, Sand|piper, and many others. The&s;e, with &s;uch as do not commit them&s;elves wholly to the waters, are thrown into a &s;eparate di|vi&s;ion, under the denomination of Waders. To the&s;e we have ventured to remove the Kingfi&s;her, and the Water Ouzel; the former lives entirely on fi&s;h, is con&s;tantly found on the margins of &s;till waters, and may with greater propriety be denominated a Water Bird than many which come under that de&s;cription; the latter &s;eems to have no connection with tho&s;e birds among
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
which it is u&s;ually cla&s;&s;ed, its bu&s;ine&s;s being wholly among ra|pid running &s;treams, in which it chiefly delights, and from whence it derives its &s;upport.</P>
<P>This work, of which the fir&s;t volume is all that is now offer|ed to the public, will contain an account of all the various tribes of birds either con&s;tantly re&s;iding in, or occa&s;ionally vi&s;iting, our i&s;land, accompanied with repre&s;entations of almo&s;t every &s;pecies, faithfully drawn from Nature, and engraven on wood. It may be proper to ob&s;erve, that while one of the Editors of this work was engaged in preparing the engravings, the compi|lation of the de&s;criptions was undertaken by the other, &s;ubject, however, to the corrections of his friend, who&s;e habits had led him to a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of Natu|ral Hi&s;tory: The Compiler, therefore, is an&s;werable for the de|fects which may be found in this part of the undertaking, con|cerning which he has little to &s;ay, but that it was the produc|tion of tho&s;e hours which could be &s;pared from a laborious em|ployment, and on that account he hopes the &s;everity of criti|ci&s;m will be &s;pared, and that it will be received with that in|dulgence which has been already experienced on a former oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN no part of the animal creation are the wi&s;dom, the good|ne&s;s, and the bounty of Providence di&s;played in a more lively manner than in the &s;tructure, formation, and various endow|ments of the feathered tribe. The &s;ymmetry and elegance di&s;|coverable in their outward appearance, although highly plea&s;ing to the &s;ight, are yet of much greater importance when con&s;ider|ed with re&s;pect to their peculiar habits and modes of living, to which they are eminently &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8">In&s;tead of the large head and formidable jaws, the deep capa|cious che&s;t, the brawny &s;houlders, and &s;inewy legs of the qua|drupeds, we ob&s;erve the pointed beak, the long and pliant neck, the gently &s;welling &s;houlder, the expan&s;ive wings, the tapering tail, the light and bony feet; all which are wi&s;ely calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t and accelerate their motion through the yielding air. Eve|ry part of their frame is formed for lightne&s;s and buoyancy; their bodies are covered with a &s;oft and delicate plumage, &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed as to protect them from the inten&s;e cold of the atmo&s;phere through which they pa&s;s; their wings are made of the lighte&s;t materials, and yet the force with which they &s;trike the air with then is &s;o great as to impel their bodies forward with a&s;toni&s;h|ing rapidity, whil&s;t the tail &s;erves the purpo&s;e of a rudder to di|rect them to the different objects of their pur&s;uit. The internal &s;tructure of birds is no le&s;s nicely adapted to the &s;ame wi&s;e and u&s;eful purpo&s;es; all their bones are light and thin, and all the mu&s;cles, except tho&s;e which are appropriated to the purpo&s;e of moving the wings, are extremely delicate and light; the lungs are placed clo&s;e to the back-bone and ribs, the air en|tering into them by a communication from the windpipe, pa&s;|&s;es through and is conveyed into a number of membranous cells which lie upon the &s;ides of the pericardium, and communicate with tho&s;e of the &s;ternum. In &s;ome birds the&s;e cells are con|tinued down the wings, and extend even to the pinions, thigh bones, and other parts of the body, which can be filled and di&s;|tended with air at the plea&s;ure of the animal.</P>
<P>The extreme &s;ingularity of this almo&s;t univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of air through the bodies of birds naturally excited a &s;trong de&s;ire to di&s;cover the intention of Nature in producing a conformation &s;o extraordinary. The ingenious Mr Hunter imagined that it might be intended to a&s;&s;i&s;t the animal in the act of flying, by increa&s;ing its bulk and &s;trength without adding to its weight. This opinion was corroborated by con&s;idering, that the feathers of birds, and particularly tho&s;e of the wings, contain a great quantity of air. In oppo&s;ition to this he informs us, that the O&s;trich, which does not fly, is neverthele&s;s provided with air
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
cells di&s;per&s;ed through its body; that the Woodcock, and &s;ome other flying birds, are not &s;o liberally &s;upplied with the&s;e cells; yet, he el&s;ewhere ob&s;erves, that it may be laid down as a general rule, that in birds of the highe&s;t and longe&s;t flights, as Eagles, this exten&s;ion or diffu&s;ion of air is carried further than in o|thers; and, with regard to the O&s;trich, though it is deprived of the power of flying, it runs with amazing rapidity, and con&s;e|quently requires &s;imilar re&s;ources of air. It &s;eems therefore to be proved, evidently, that this general diffu&s;ion of air through the bodies of birds is of infinite u&s;e to them, not only in their long and laborious flights, but likewi&s;e in preventing their re&s;pi|ration from being &s;topped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion through a re&s;i&s;ting medium. Were it po&s;&s;ible for man to move with the &s;wiftne&s;s of a Swallow, the actual re&s;i&s;tance of the air, as he is not provided with internal re&s;ervoirs &s;imilar to tho&s;e of birds, would &s;oon &s;uffocate him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May not this univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of air through the bodies of birds ac|count for the &s;uperior heat of this cla&s;s of animals? The &s;eparation of oxy|gen from re&s;pirable air, and its mixture with the blood, by means of the lungs, being &s;uppo&s;ed by the ingenious Dr Crawford to be the efficient cau&s;e of animal hent.</NOTE></P>
<P>Birds may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, like quadrupeds, into two kinds or cla&s;&s;es, granivorous and carnivorous; like quadrupeds too, there are &s;ome that hold a middle nature, and partake of both. Granivorous birds are furni&s;hed with larger inte&s;tines, and pro|portionally longer than tho&s;e of the carnivorous kinds. Their food, which con&s;i&s;ts of grain of various kinds, is conveyed whole and entire into the fir&s;t &s;tomach or craw, where it undergoes a partial dilution by a liquor &s;ecreted from glands &s;pread over its &s;urface; it is then received into another &s;pecies of &s;tomach, where it is further diluted; after which it is tran&s;mitted into the gizzard, or true &s;tomach, con&s;i&s;ting of two very &s;trong mu&s;|cles covered externally with a tendinous &s;ub&s;tance, and lined with a thick membrane of prodigious power and &s;trength; in this place the food is completely triturated, and rendered fit for the operation of the ga&s;tric juices. The extraordinary powers
<PB N="x" REF="10">
of the gizzard in comminuting the food, &s;o as to prepare it for dige&s;tion, would exceed all credibility, were they not &s;upported by incontrovertible facts founded upon experiments. In order to a&s;certain the &s;trength of the&s;e &s;tomachs, the ingenious Spa|lanzani made the following curious and very intere&s;ting experi|ments:&mdash;Tin tubes, full of grain, were forced into the &s;tomachs of Turkies, and after remaining twenty hours, were found to be broken, compre&s;&s;ed, and di&s;torted in the mo&s;t irregular manner.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spalanzani's Di&s;&s;ertation, vol, 1, page 12.</NOTE> In proceeding further, the &s;ame author relates, that the &s;tomach of a Cock, in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, broke off the an|gles of a piece of rough jagged gla&s;s, and upon examining the gizzard, no wound or laceration appeared. Twelve &s;trong nee|dles were firmly fixed in a ball of lead, the points of which pro|jected about a quarter of an inch from the &s;urface; thus armed, it was covered with a ca&s;e of paper, and forced down the throat of a Turkey; the bird retained it a day and a half, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of unea&s;ine&s;s; the points of all the needles were broken off clo&s;e to the &s;urface of the ball, except two or three, of which the &s;tumps projected a little. The &s;ame author relates another experiment, &s;eemingly &s;till more cruel: He fixed twelve &s;mall lancets, very &s;harp, in a &s;imilar ball of lead, which was given in the &s;ame manner to a Turkey-cock, and left eight hours in the &s;tomach; at the expiration of which the organ was opened, but nothing appeared except the naked ball, the twelve lancets having been broken to pieces, the &s;to|mach remaining perfectly &s;ound and entire. From the&s;e curi|ous and well-atte&s;ted facts we may conclude, that the &s;tones &s;o often found in the &s;tomachs of many of the feathered tribe are highly u&s;eful in comminuting the grain and other hard &s;ub&s;tan|ces which con&s;titute their food. "The &s;tones," &s;ays the cele|brated Dr Hunter, "a&s;&s;i&s;t in grinding down the grain, and, by &s;eparating its parts, allow the ga&s;tric juices to come more rea|dily into contact with it." Thus far the conclu&s;ion coincides with the experiments which have been ju&s;t related. We may
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
ob&s;erve &s;till farther, that the &s;tones thus taken into the &s;tomachs of birds are &s;eldom known to pa&s;s with the faeces, but being ground down and &s;eparated by the powerful action of the giz|zard, are mixed with the food, and, no doubt, contribute very much to the health as well as nutriment of the animal.</P>
<P>Granivorous birds partake much of the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of herbivorous quadrupeds. In both, the number of their &s;to|machs, the length and capacity of their inte&s;tines, and the qua|lity of their food, are very &s;imilar; they are likewi&s;e both di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the gentlene&s;s of their tempers and manners: Contented with the &s;eeds of plants, with fruits, in&s;ects, and worms, their chief attention is directed to procuring food, hatch|ing and rearing their offspring, and avoiding the &s;nares of men, and the attacks of birds of prey and other rapacious animals. They are a mild and gentle race, and are in general &s;o tractable as ea&s;ily to be dome&s;ticated. Man, ever attentive and watchful to every thing conducive to his intere&s;t, has not failed to avail him&s;elf of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, and has judiciou&s;ly &s;elected, from the numbers which every way &s;urround him, tho&s;e which are mo&s;t prolific, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t profitable: Of the&s;e the Hen, the Goo&s;e, the Turkey, and the Duck are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and form an inexhau&s;tible &s;tore of rich, whole|&s;ome, and nutritious food.</P>
<P>Carnivorous birds are di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e endowments and powers with which they are furni&s;hed by Nature for the purpo&s;e of procuring their food: They are provided with wings of great length, the mu&s;cles which move them being proportionally large and &s;trong, whereby they are enabled to keep long upon the wing in &s;earch of their prey; they are armed with &s;trong hook|ed bills, &s;harp and formidable claws; they have al&s;o large heads, &s;hort necks, &s;trong and brawny thighs, and a &s;ight &s;o acute and piercing, as to enable them to view their prey from immea&s;ure|able heights in the air, upon which they dart with inconceive|able &s;wiftne&s;s and undeviating aim; their &s;tomachs are &s;maller than tho&s;e of the granivorous kinds, and their inte&s;tines are much &s;horter. The analogy between the &s;tructure of rapacious
<PB N="x" REF="12">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
birds and carnivorous quadrupeds is obvious; both of them are provided with weapons which indicate de&s;truction and ra|pine, their manners are fierce and un&s;ocial, and they &s;eldom herd together in flocks like the inoffen&s;ive granivorous tribes. When not on the wing, rapacious birds retire to the tops of &s;e|que&s;tered rocks, or the depths of exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, where they conceal them&s;elves in &s;ullen and gloomy &s;olitude. Tho&s;e which feed on carrion are endowed with a &s;en&s;e of &s;melling &s;o exqui&s;ite, as to enable them to &s;cent dead and putrid carca&s;es at a&s;toni&s;h|ing di&s;tances.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e great divi&s;ions of birds into granivorous and ra|pacious kinds, there are numerous other tribes, to whom Nature has given &s;uitable organs, adapted to their peculiar habits and modes of living. Like amphibious animals, a great variety of birds live chiefly in the water, and feed on fi&s;hes, in&s;ects, and other aquatic productions: To enable them to &s;wim and dive in que&s;t of food, their toes are connected by broad membranes or webs, with which they &s;trike the water, and are driven for|ward with great force. The &s;eas, the lakes, and rivers abound with innumerable &s;warms of birds of various kinds, all which find an abundant &s;upply in the immea&s;urable &s;tores with which the watery world is every where &s;tocked. There are other tribes of aquatic birds, frequenting mar&s;hy places and the mar|gins of lakes and rivers, which &s;eem to partake of a middle na|ture between tho&s;e which live wholly on land, and tho&s;e which are entirely occupied in waters: Some of the&s;e feed on fi&s;hes and reptiles; others derive nouri&s;hment by thru&s;ting their long bills into &s;oft and muddy &s;ub&s;tances, where they find worms, the eggs of in&s;ects, and other nutritious matter; they do not &s;wim, but wade in que&s;t of food, for which purpo&s;e Nature has provided them with long legs, bare of feathers even above the knees; their toes are not connected by webs, like tho&s;e of the &s;wimmers, but are only partially furni&s;hed with membranaceous appendages, which are ju&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;upport them on the &s;oft and doubtful ground which they are accu&s;tomed to frequent:&mdash; Mo&s;t of the&s;e kinds have very long necks and bills, to enable
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
them to &s;earch for and find their concealed food. To the&s;e tribes belong the Crane, the Heron, the Bittern, the Stork, the Spoonbill, the Woodcock, the Snipe, and many others.</P>
<P>Without the means of conveying them&s;elves with great &s;wift|ne&s;s from one place to another, birds could not ea&s;ily &s;ub&s;i&s;t: The food which Nature has &s;o bountifully provided for them is &s;o ir|regularly di&s;tributed, that they are obliged to take long journies to di&s;tant parts in order to gain the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies; at one time it is given in great abundance; at another it is admini&s;ter|ed with a very &s;paring hand; and this is one cau&s;e of tho&s;e mi|grations &s;o peculiar to the feathered tribe. Be&s;ides the want of food, there are two other cau&s;es of migration, viz. the want of a proper temperature of air, and a convenient &s;ituation for the great work of breeding and rearing their young. Such birds as migrate to great di&s;tances are alone denominated <HI>birds of pa&s;|&s;age;</HI> but mo&s;t birds are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, birds of pa&s;&s;age, al|though they do not migrate to places remote from their former habitations. At particular times of the year mo&s;t birds remove from one country to another, or from the more inland di&s;tricts toward the &s;hores: The times of the&s;e migrations or flittings are ob&s;erved with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing order and punctuality; but the &s;ecrecy of their departure and the &s;uddenne&s;s of their re-appearance have involved the &s;ubject of migration in general in great difficulties. Much of this difficulty ari&s;es from our not being able to account for the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during the long flights of many of tho&s;e birds, which are obliged to cro&s;s immen&s;e tracts of water before they arrive at the places of their de&s;tination: Accu&s;tomed to mea&s;ure di&s;tances by the &s;peed of tho&s;e animals with which we are well acquainted, we are apt to overlook the &s;uperior velocity with which birds are carried forward in the air, and the ea&s;e with which they continue their exertions for a much longer time than can be done by the &s;tronge&s;t quadruped.</P>
<P>Our &s;wifte&s;t hor&s;es are &s;uppo&s;ed to go at the rate of a mile in &s;omewhat le&s;s than two minutes, and we have one in&s;tance on record of a hor&s;e being tried, which went at the rate of near|ly
<PB N="xiv" REF="16">
a mile in one minute, but that was only for the &s;mall &s;pace of a &s;econd of time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;tory of Quadrupeds, page 6, 3d edition.</NOTE> In this and &s;imilar in&s;tances we find, that an uncommon degree of exertion was attended with its u&s;ual con&s;equences, debility, and a total want of power to continue it to the &s;ame extent; but the ca&s;e is very different with birds, their motions are not impeded by the &s;ame cau&s;es, they glide through the air with a quickne&s;s &s;uperior to that of the &s;wifte&s;t quadruped, and they can continue on the wing with the &s;ame &s;peed for a con&s;iderable length of time. Now, if we can &s;up|po&s;e a bird to go at the rate of only half a mile in a minute, for the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, it will have gone over, in that time, an extent of more than &s;even hundred miles, which is &s;uf|ficient to account for almo&s;t the longe&s;t migration; but if aid|ed by a favourable current of air, there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ame journey may be performed in a much &s;horter &s;pace of time. To the&s;e ob&s;ervations we may add, that the &s;ight of birds is peculiarly quick and piercing; and from the advantage they po&s;&s;e&s;s in being rai&s;ed to con&s;iderable heights in the air, which is well known to be the ca&s;e with the Stork, Bittern, and other kinds of birds, they are enabled, with a &s;agacity pe|culiar to in&s;tinctive knowledge, to di&s;cover the route they are to take, from the appearance of the atmo&s;phere, the clouds, the direction of the winds, and other cau&s;es; &s;o that, without having recour&s;e to improbable modes, it is ea&s;y to conceive, from the velocity of their &s;peed alone, that mo&s;t birds may tran&s;port them&s;elves to countries laying at great di&s;tances, and acro&s;s va&s;t tracts of ocean.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations from Cate&s;by are very applicable, and will conclude our remarks on this head:
<Q>The manner of their journeyings may vary according as the &s;tructure of their bodies enables them to &s;upport them&s;elves in the air. Birds with &s;hort wings, &s;uch as the Red&s;tart, Black-cap, &amp;c. may pa&s;s by gradual and &s;lower movements; and there &s;eems no nece&s;&s;ity for a precipitate pa&s;&s;age, as every day affords an in|crea&s;e
<PB N="xv" REF="17">
of warmth, and a continuance of food. It is probable the&s;e itinerants may perform their journey in the night-time, in order to avoid ravenous birds, and other dangers which day-light may expo&s;e them to. The flight of the &s;maller birds of pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the &s;eas has, by many, been con&s;idered as wonderful, and e&s;pecially with regard to tho&s;e with &s;hort wings, among which Quails &s;eem by their &s;tructure little a|dapted for long flights; nor are they ever &s;een to continue on the wing for any length of time, and yet their ability for &s;uch flights cannot be doubted. The coming of the&s;e birds is certain and regular from every year's experience, but the cau&s;e and manner of their departure have not always been &s;o happily accounted for; in &s;hort, all we know of the matter ends in this ob&s;ervation;&mdash;that Providence has created a great variety of birds and other animals with con&s;titutions and inclinations adapted to their &s;everal wants and nece&s;&s;ities, as well as to the different degrees of heat and cold in the &s;e|veral climates of the world, whereby no country is de&s;titute of inhabitants, and has given them appetites for the produc|tions of tho&s;e countries who&s;e temperature is &s;uited to their nature, as well as knowledge and ability to &s;eek and find them out.</Q></P>
<P>The migration of the Swallow tribe has been noticed by al|mo&s;t every writer on the natural hi&s;tory of birds, and various opinions have been formed re&s;pecting their di&s;appearance, and the &s;tate in which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t during that interval. Some Na|turali&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e that they do not leave this i&s;land at the end of autumn, but that they lie in a torpid &s;tate, till the beginning of &s;ummer, in the banks of rivers, in the hollows of decayed trees, in holes and crevices of old buildings, in &s;and banks, and the like: Some have even a&s;&s;erted that Swallows pa&s;s the winter im|mer&s;ed in the waters of lakes and rivers, where they have been found in clu&s;ters, mouth to mouth, wing to wing, foot to foot, and that they retire to the&s;e places in autumn, and creep down the reeds to their &s;ubaqueous retreats. In &s;upport of this opi|nion, Mr Klein very gravely a&s;&s;erts, on the credit of &s;ome coun|trymen,
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">
that Swallows &s;ometimes a&s;&s;embled in numbers, cling|ing to a reed till it broke, and &s;unk with them to the bottom; that their immer&s;ion was preceded by a &s;ong or dirge, which la&s;ted more than a quarter of an hour; &s;ometimes they laid hold of a &s;traw with their bills, and plunged down in &s;ociety; and that others formed a large ma&s;s, by clinging together by the feet, and in this manner committing them&s;elves to the deep. It re|quires no great depth of rea&s;oning to refute &s;uch palpable ab&s;ur|dities, or to &s;hew the phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibility of a body, &s;pecifical|ly lighter than water, employing another body lighter than it|&s;elf for the purpo&s;e of immer&s;ion: But, admitting the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of this curious mode of immer&s;ion, it is by no means proba|ble that Swallows, or any other animal, in a torpid &s;tate, can ex|i&s;t for any length of time in an element to which they have ne|ver been accu&s;tomed, and are be&s;ides totally unprovided by Na|ture with organs &s;uited to &s;uch a mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mr John Hunter informs us, "that he had di&s;&s;ected many Swallows, but found nothing in them different from other birds as to the organs of re&s;piration;" and therefore concludes that it is highly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that terre&s;trial ani|mals can remain any long time under water without drowning. It mu&s;t not however be denied, that Swallows have been &s;ome|times found in a torpid &s;tate during the winter months; but &s;uch in&s;tances are by no means common, and will not &s;upport the in|ference, that, if any of them can &s;urvive the winter in that &s;tate, the whole &s;pecies is pre&s;erved in the &s;ame manner.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are various in&s;tances on record, which bear the &s;tronge&s;t marks of veracity, of Swallows having been taken out of water, and of their having been &s;o far recovered by warmth as to exhibit evident &s;igns of life, &s;o as even to fly about for a &s;hort &s;pace of time. But whil&s;t we admit the fact, we are not inclined to allow the conclu&s;ion generally drawn from it, viz. that Swallows, at the time of their di&s;appearance, fre|quently immer&s;e them&s;elves in &s;eas, lakes, and rivers, and at the proper &s;ea&s;on emerge and re-a&s;&s;ume the ordinary functions of life and anima|tion; for, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that in tho&s;e in&s;tances, which have been the be&s;t authenticated, [See For&s;ter's Tran&s;lation of Kalm's Travels into North America, p. 140&mdash;note.] it appears, that the Swallows &s;o taken up were generally found entangled among&s;t reeds and ru&s;hes, by the &s;ides, or in the &s;hallowe&s;t parts of the lakes or rivers where they happened to be di&s;covered, and that having been brought to life &s;o far as to fly about, they all of them died in a few hours after. From the facts thus &s;tated we would infer, that at the time of the di&s;appearance of Swallows, the reedy grounds by the &s;ides of rivers and &s;tanding waters are generally dry, and that the&s;e birds, e&s;pecially the later hatchings, which frequent &s;uch places for the &s;ake of food, retire to them at the proper &s;ea&s;on, and lodge them&s;elves among the roots, or in the thicke&s;t parts of the rank gra&s;s which grows there; that during their &s;tate of torpidity they are liable to be covered with water, from the rains which follow, and are &s;ometimes wa&s;hed into the deeper parts of the lake or river where they have been accidentally taken up; and that probably the tran&s;ient &s;igns of life which they have di&s;covered on &s;uch occa&s;ions, have given ri&s;e to a variety of vague and improbable accounts of their immer&s;ion, &amp;c.</NOTE> That other
<PB N="xvii" REF="19">
birds have been found in a torpid &s;tate may be inferred from the following curious fact, which was communicated to us by a gentleman who &s;aw the bird, and had the account from the per&s;on who found it. A few years ago, a young Cuckoo was found in the thicke&s;t part of a clo&s;e whin bu&s;h; when ta|ken up it pre&s;ently di&s;covered &s;igns of life, but was quite de|&s;titute of feathers; being kept warm, and carefully fed, it grew and recovered its coat of feathers: In the &s;pring follow|ing it made its e&s;cape, and in flying acro&s;s the river Tyne it gave its u&s;ual call. We have ob&s;erved a &s;ingle Swallow &s;o late as the latter end of October. Mr White, in his Natural Hi&s;|tory of Selborne, mentions hating &s;een a Hou&s;e Martin flying about in November, long after the general migration had taken place. Many more in&s;tances might be given of &s;uch late ap|pearances, which, added to the well-authenticated accounts of Swallows having been actually found in a torpid &s;tate, leave us no room to doubt, that &s;uch young birds as have been late hatched, and con&s;equently not &s;trong enough to undertake a long voyage to the coa&s;t of Africa, are left behind, and re|main concealed in hiding places till the return of &s;pring: On the other hand, that actual migrations of the Swallow tribes do take place, has been fully proved from a variety of well-atte&s;ted
<PB N="xviii" REF="20">
facts, mo&s;t of which have been taken from the ob&s;ervations of navigators who have been eye-witne&s;&s;es of their flights, and who&s;e &s;hips have &s;ometimes afforded a re&s;ting-place to the weary travellers.</P>
<P>To the many on record we &s;hall add the following, which we received from a very &s;en&s;ible ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, who, whil&s;t he was &s;ailing early in the &s;pring between the i&s;lands of Minor|ca and Majorca, &s;aw great numbers of Swallows flying north|ward, many of whom alighted on the rigging of the &s;hip in the evening, but di&s;appeared before morning. After all our in|quiries into this branch of natural oeconomy, much yet remains to be known, and we may conclude, in the words of the inge|nious Mr White,
<Q>that whil&s;t we ob&s;erve with delight with how much ardour and punctuality tho&s;e little birds obey the &s;trong impul&s;e towards migration or hiding, imprinted on their minds by their great Creator, it is with no &s;mall de|gree of mortification that we reflect, that after all our pains and inquiries, we are not yet quite certain to what regions they do migrate, and are &s;till farther embarra&s;&s;ed to find that &s;ome do not actually migrate at all.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Amu&s;ive birds! &s;ay where your hid retreat,</L>
<L>When the fro&s;t rages, and the tempe&s;ts beat;</L>
<L>Whence your return, by &s;uch nice in&s;tinct led,</L>
<L>When Spring, &s;weet &s;ea&s;on, lifts her bloomy head?</L>
<L>Such baffled &s;earches mock man's prying pride,</L>
<L>The GOD of NATURE is your &s;ecret guide!</L></Q>
<P>Mo&s;t birds, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, live together in pairs; the union is formed in the &s;pring, and generally continues whil&s;t the united efforts of both are nece&s;&s;ary in forming their tem|porary habitations, and in rearing and maintaining their off|&s;pring. Eagles and other birds of prey continue their attach|ment for a much longer time, and &s;ometimes for life. The ne&s;ts of birds are con&s;tructed with &s;uch exqui&s;ite art, as to ex|ceed the utmo&s;t exertion of human ingenuity to imitate them. Their mode of building, the materials they make u&s;e of, as well as the &s;ituations they &s;elect, are as various as the different kinds
<PB N="xix" REF="21">
of birds, and are all admirably adapted to their &s;everal wants and nece&s;&s;ities. Birds of the &s;ame &s;pecies, whatever region of the globe they inhabit, collect the &s;ame materials, arrange them in the &s;ame manner, and make choice of &s;imilar &s;ituations for fixing the places of their temporary abodes. To de&s;cribe minutely the different kinds of ne&s;ts, the various &s;ub&s;tances of which they are compo&s;ed, and the judicious choice of &s;ituations, would &s;well this part of our work much beyond its due bounds. Every part of the world furni&s;hes materials for the aerial archi|tects; leaves and &s;mall twigs, roots and dried gra&s;s, mixed with clay, &s;erve for the external; whil&s;t mo&s;s, wool, fine hair, and the &s;ofte&s;t animal and vegetable downs, form the warm internal part of the&s;e commodious dwellings. The following beautiful lines from Thom&s;on are highly de&s;criptive of the bu&s;y &s;cene which takes place during the time of nidification.

After the bu&s;ine&s;s of incubation is over, and the young are &s;uf|ficiently able to provide for them&s;elves, the ne&s;ts are always abandoned by the parents, excepting tho&s;e of the Eagle kind.</P>
<P>The various gifts and endowments which the great Author of Nature has &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon his creatures in general, demand, in a peculiar manner, the attention of the curious Naturali&s;t; among&s;t the feathered tribe in particular there is much room, in this re&s;pect, for minute and attentive inve&s;tiga|tion. In pur&s;uing our inquiries into that &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy, by which every part of Nature is upheld and pre&s;erved, we are &s;truck with wonder in ob&s;erving the havock and de&s;truction which every where prevail throughout the various orders of be|ings inhabiting the earth. Our humanity is intere&s;ted in that law of Nature, which devotes to de&s;truction myriads of creatures to &s;upport and continue the exi&s;tence of others; but, although
<PB N="xx" REF="22">
it is not allowed us to unravel the my&s;terious workings of Na|ture through all her parts, or unfold her deep de&s;igns, we are, neverthele&s;s, &s;trongly led to the con&s;ideration of the means by which individuals, as well as &s;pecies, are pre&s;erved and multiplied. The weak are frequently enabled to elude the pur&s;uits of the &s;trong, by flight or &s;tratagem; &s;ome are &s;creened from the pur|&s;uit of their enemies, by an arrangement of colours happily a&s;&s;i|milated to the places which they mo&s;t frequent, and where they find either food or repo&s;e; thus the Wryneck is &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the bark of the tree on which it feeds, or the Snipe from the &s;oft and mo&s;&s;y ground by the &s;prings of water which it frequents; the Great Plover finds its greate&s;t &s;ecurity in &s;tony places, to which its colours are &s;o nicely adapted, that the mo&s;t exact ob&s;erver may be very ea&s;ily deceived.</P>
<P>The attentive Ornithologi&s;t will not fail to di&s;cover numerous in&s;tances of this kind, &s;uch as the Partridge, Plover, Quail, &amp;c. Some are indebted to the brilliancy of their colours as the means of alluring their prey; of this the Kingfi&s;her is a remarkable in|&s;tance, and de&s;erves to be particularly noticed. This beautiful bird has been ob&s;erved, in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered places, near the edge of a rivulet, expo&s;ing the vivid colours of its brea&s;t to the full rays of the &s;un, and fluttering with expanded wings over the &s;mooth &s;urface of the water; the fi&s;h, attracted by the bright|ne&s;s and &s;plendour of the appearance, are detained whil&s;t the wily bird darts down upon them with unerring certainty. We do not &s;ay that the mode of taking fi&s;h by torch-light has been derived from this practi&s;ed by the Kingfi&s;her, but every one mu&s;t be &s;truck by the &s;imilarity of the means. Others, again, derive the &s;ame advantage from the &s;implicity of their exterior appearance; of this the Heron will &s;erve as an example. He may frequently be &s;een &s;tanding motionle&s;s by the edge of a piece of water, waiting patiently the approach of his prey, which he never fails to &s;eize as &s;oon as it comes within reach of his long neck; he then rea&s;&s;umes his former po&s;ition, and con|tinues to wait with the &s;ame patient attention as before.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the &s;maller birds are &s;upported, e&s;pecially when
<PB N="xxi" REF="23">
young, by a profu&s;ion of caterpillars, &s;mall worms, and in&s;ects, with which every part of the vegetable world abounds; which is by this means pre&s;erved from total de&s;truction, contrary to the commonly received opinion, that birds, particularly Sparrows, do much mi&s;chief in de&s;troying the labours of the gardener and the hu&s;bandman. It has been ob&s;erved, "that a &s;ingle pair of Sparrows, during the time they are feeding their young, will de&s;troy about four thou&s;and caterpillars weekly; they likewi&s;e feed their young with butterflies and other winged in&s;ects, each of which, if not de&s;troyed in this manner, would be productive of &s;everal hundreds of caterpillars." Swallows are almo&s;t con|tinually upon the wing, and in their curious winding flights de|&s;troy immen&s;e quantities of flies and other in&s;ects which are con|tinually floating in the air, and which, if not de&s;troyed by the&s;e birds, would render it unfit for the purpo&s;es of life and health. That active little bird, the Tomtit, which has generally been &s;uppo&s;ed ho&s;tile to the young and tender buds which appear in the &s;pring, when attentively ob&s;erved, may be &s;een running up and down among&s;t the branches, and picking the &s;mall worms which are concealed in the blo&s;&s;oms, and which would effectual|ly de&s;troy the fruit. As the &s;ea&s;on advances, various other &s;mall birds, &s;uch as the Redbrea&s;t, Wren, Winter Fauvette or Hedge-&s;parrow, Whitethroat, Red&s;tart, &amp;c. are all engaged in the &s;ame u&s;eful work, and may be ob&s;erved examining every leaf, and feeding upon the in&s;ects which they find beneath them. &mdash;The&s;e are a few in&s;tances of that &s;uperintending providential care, which is continually exerted in pre&s;erving the various ranks and orders of beings in the &s;cale of animated Nature; and al|though it is permitted that myriads of individuals &s;hould every moment be de&s;troyed, not a &s;ingle &s;pecies is lo&s;t, but every link of the great chain remains unbroken</P>
<P>Great Britain produces a more abundant variety of birds than mo&s;t northern countries, owing to the various condition of our lands, from the highe&s;t &s;tate of cultivation to that of the wilde&s;t, mo&s;t mountainous, and woody. The great quantities
<PB N="xxii" REF="24">
of berries and other kinds of fruit produced in our hedges, heaths, and plantations, bring &s;mall birds in great numbers, and birds of prey in con&s;equence: Our &s;hores, and the numerous little i&s;lands adjacent to them, afford &s;helter and protection to an infinite variety of almo&s;t all kinds of water fowl. To enu|merate the various kinds of birds that vi&s;it this i&s;land annually will not, we pre&s;ume, be unacceptable to our readers, nor im|proper in this part of our work. The following are &s;elected chiefly from Mr White's Natural Hi&s;tory of Selborne, and are arranged nearly in the order of their appearing.</P>

<P>Mo&s;t of the &s;oft-billed birds feed on in&s;ects, and not on grain or &s;eeds, and therefore u&s;ually retire before winter; but the fol|lowing, though they eat in&s;ects, remain with us during the whole year, viz. The Redbrea&s;t, Winter Fauvette, and Wren,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="25">
which frequent out-hou&s;es and gardens, and eat &s;piders, &s;mall worms, crumbs, &amp;c. The Pied, the Yellow, and the Grey Wagtail, which frequent the heads of &s;prings, where the waters &s;eldom freeze, and feed on the aureliae of in&s;ects u|&s;ually depo&s;ited there: Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Whinchat, the Stonechatter, and the Golden-cre&s;ted Wren, are &s;een with us during the winter; the latter, though the lea&s;t of all the Bri|ti&s;h birds, is very hardy, and can endure the utmo&s;t &s;everity of our winters. The White rump, though not common, &s;ometimes &s;tays the winter with us.&mdash;Of the winter birds of pa&s;&s;age, the following are the principal, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1 The Redwing or Wind Thru&s;h.</P>
<P N="2">2 The Fieldfare.&mdash;[Both the&s;e arrive in great numbers about Michaelmas, and depart about the end of February, or begin|ning of March.]</P>
<P N="3">3 The Hooded or Sea Crow vi&s;its us in the beginning of winter, and departs with the Woodcock.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Woodcock appears about Michaelmas, and leaves us about the beginning of March.</P>
<P N="4">5 Snipes are con&s;idered by Mr White as birds of pa&s;&s;age, though he acknowledges that they frequently breed with us. Mr Pennant remarks, that their young are &s;o frequently found in Britain, that it may be doubted whether they ever entirely leave this i&s;land.</P>
<P N="6">6 The Judcock or Jack Snipe.</P>
<P N="7">7 The Wood Pigeon: Of the preci&s;e time of its arrival we are not quite certain, but &s;uppo&s;e it may be &s;ome time in April, as we have &s;een them in the north at that time.</P>
<P N="8">8 The Wild Swan frequents the coa&s;ts of this i&s;land in large flocks, but is not &s;uppo&s;ed to breed with us: It has been chiefly met with in the northern parts, and is &s;aid to arrive at Lingey, one of the Hebrides, in October, and remains there till March, when it retires more northward to breed.</P>
<P N="9">9 The Wild Goo&s;e pa&s;&s;es &s;outhward in October, and re|turns northward in April.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="26">With regard to the Duck kind in general, they are mo&s;tly birds of pa&s;&s;age. Mr Pennant ob&s;erves,
<Q>Of the numerous &s;pecies that form this genus, we know of no more than five that breed here, viz the Tame Swan, the Tame Goo&s;e, the Shield Duck, the Eider Duck, and a very &s;mall number of the Wild Ducks: The re&s;t contribute to form that amazing multitude of water fowl that annually repair from mo&s;t parts of Europe to the woods and lakes of Lapland and other arc|tic regions, there to perform the functions of incubation and nutrition in full &s;ecurity. They and their young quit their re|treats in September, and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves over Europe. With us they make their appearance in the beginning of October, circulate fir&s;t round our &s;hores, and, when compel|led by &s;evere fro&s;t, betake them&s;elves to our lakes and ri|vers.</Q>&mdash;In winter the Bernacles and Brent Gee&s;e appear in va&s;t flocks on the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of Britain, and leave us in February, when they migrate as far as Lapland, Greenland, or Spitzbergen.</P>
<P>The Solon Gee&s;e or Gannets are birds of pa&s;&s;age; their fir&s;t appearance is in March, and they continue till Augu&s;t or Sep|tember. The Long-legged Plover and Sanderling vi&s;it us in winter only; and it is worthy of remark, that every &s;pecies of the Curlews, Woodcocks, Sandpipers, and Plovers, which for|&s;ake us in the &s;pring, retire to Sweden, Poland, Pru&s;&s;ia, Nor|way, and Lapland to breed, and return to us as &s;oon as the young are able to fly; the fro&s;ts, which &s;et in early in tho&s;e countries, depriving them totally of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a great variety of birds which perform partial migrations, or flittings, from one part of the country to another. During hard winters, when the &s;urface of the earth is covered with &s;now, many birds, &s;uch as Larks, Snipes, &amp;c. withdraw from the inland parts of the country towards the &s;ea-&s;hores in que&s;t of food; others, as the Wren, the Redbrea&s;t, and a variety of &s;mall birds, quit the fields, and approach the habitations of men. The Bohemian Chatterer, the Gro&s;beak, and the Cro&s;sbill, are only occa&s;ional vi&s;itors, and ob&s;erve no
<PB N="xxv" REF="27">
regular times in making their appearance: Great numbers of the former were taken in the county of Northumberland the latter end of the years 1789 and 1790, before which they had not been ob&s;erved &s;o far &s;outh as that county, and &s;ince that time have never been &s;een there.</P>
<P>The ages of birds are various, and do not &s;eem to bear the &s;ame proportion to the time of acquiring their growth as has been remarked with regard to quadrupeds. Mo&s;t birds acquire their full dimen&s;ions in a few months, and are capable of propa|gation the fir&s;t &s;ummer after they are hatched. In proportion to the &s;ize of their bodies, birds are much more vivacious, and live longer, than either man or quadrupeds: Notwith&s;tanding the difficulties which ari&s;e in a&s;certaining the ages of birds, there are in&s;tances of great longevity in many of them. Gee&s;e and Swans have been known to attain the age of one hundred or upwards; Ravens are very long-lived birds, and are &s;aid &s;ometimes to exceed a century; Eagles are &s;uppo&s;ed to arrive at a great age; Pigeons are known to live more than twenty years; and even Linnets and other &s;mall birds have been kept in cages from fifteen to twenty years.</P>
<P>To the practical Ornithologi&s;t there ari&s;es a con&s;iderable gra|tification in being able to di&s;cern the di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of birds as they appear at a di&s;tance, whether at re&s;t, or during their flight; for not only every &s;pecies has &s;omething peculiar to it&s;elf, but each genus has its own appropriate marks, upon which a judicious ob&s;erver may di&s;criminate with almo&s;t uner|ring certainty. Of the&s;e, the various modes of flight afford the mo&s;t certain and obvious means of di&s;tinction, and &s;hould be noted with the mo&s;t careful attention. From the bold and lofty flight of the Eagle, to the &s;hort and &s;udden flittings of the Sparrow or the Wren, there is an ample field for the curious inve&s;tigator of Nature, on which he may dwell with inexpre&s;|&s;ible delight, tracing the various movements of the feathered nations which every where pre&s;ent them&s;elves to his view. The notes, or, as it may with more propriety be called, the language, of birds, whereby they are enabled to expre&s;s, in no incon&s;ider|able
<PB N="xxvi" REF="28">
degree, their various pa&s;&s;ions, wants, and feelings, mu&s;t be particularly noticed:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">White's Selborne.</NOTE> The great power of their voice, by which they can communicate their &s;entiments and intentions to each other, and by that means are able to act by mutual concert, ad|ded to that of the wing, by which they can remove from place to place with inconceivable celerity and di&s;patch, is peculiar to the feathered tribes; it gives them a decided &s;uperiority over every &s;pecies of quadrupeds, and affords them the greate&s;t means of &s;afety from tho&s;e attacks to which their weakne&s;s would otherwi&s;e expo&s;e them. The &s;ocial in&s;tinct among birds is pe|culiarly lively and intere&s;ting, and likewi&s;e proves an effectual means of pre&s;ervation from the various arts which are made u&s;e of to circumvent and de&s;troy them. Individuals may peri&s;h, and the &s;pecies may &s;uffer a diminution of its numbers; but its in&s;tincts, habits, and oeconomy remain entire.</P>

<HEAD>BRITISH BIRDS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BIRDS OF PREY.</HEAD>
<P>RAPACIOUS birds, or tho&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on fle&s;h, are much le&s;s numerous than ravenous quadrupeds; and it &s;eems wi&s;ely provided by na|ture, that their powers &s;hould be equally confined and limited as their numbers; for if, to the rapid flight and penetrating eye of the Eagle, were join|ed the &s;trength and voracious appetite of the Lion, the Tiger, or the Glutton, no artifice could evade the one, and no &s;peed could e&s;cape the other.</P>
<P>The characters of birds of the ravenous kind are particularly &s;trong, and ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed; the formidable talons, the large head, the &s;trong and crooked beak, indicate their ability for rapine and carnage; their di&s;po&s;itions are fierce, and their nature untractable; un&s;ociable and cruel, they avoid the haunts of civilization, and retire to the mo&s;t melancholy and wild rece&s;&s;es of nature, where they can enjoy, in gloomy &s;olitude, the ef|fects of their depredatory excur&s;ions. The fierce|ne&s;s of their nature extends even to their young,
<PB N="2" REF="34">
which they drive from the ne&s;t at a very early period; the difficulty of procuring a con&s;tant &s;up|ply of food for them &s;ometimes overcomes the feelings of parental affection; and they have been known to de&s;troy them in the fury of di&s;appointed hunger. Different from all other kinds, the fe|male of birds of prey is larger and &s;tronger than the male: naturali&s;ts have puzzled them&s;elves to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on of this extraordinary property, but the final cau&s;e at lea&s;t is obvious:&mdash;The care of rearing her young being &s;olely intru&s;ted to the female, nature has furni&s;hed her with more ample powers to provide for her own wants and tho&s;e of her offspring.</P>
<P>This formidable tribe con&s;titutes the fir&s;t order among the genera of birds. Tho&s;e of our own country con&s;i&s;t only of two kinds, viz. the Falcon and the Owl.&mdash;We &s;hall begin with the former.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE FALCON TRIBE.</HEAD>
<P>THE numerous families of which this kind is compo&s;ed, are found in almo&s;t every part of the world, from the frigid to the torrid zone; they are divided into various cla&s;&s;es or tribes, con&s;i&s;t|ing of Eagles, Kites, Buzzards, Hawks, &amp;c. and are readily known by the following di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics:</P>
<P>The bill is &s;trong, &s;harp, and much hooked, and is furni&s;hed with a naked &s;kin or cere &s;ituated at
<PB N="3" REF="35">
the ba&s;e, in which are placed the no&s;trils; the head and neck are well clothed with feathers, which &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h it from every one of the vulture kind; the legs and feet are &s;caly, claws large and &s;trong, much hooked, and very &s;harp: Birds of this &s;pecies are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by their undaunted courage, and great activity. Buffon, &s;peaking of the Eagle, compares it with the Lion, and a&s;cribes to it the magnanimity, the &s;trength, and the forbearance of that noble quadru|ped. The Eagle de&s;pi&s;es &s;mall animals, and di&s;|regards their in&s;ults; he &s;eldom devours the whole of his prey, but, like the Lion, leaves the fragments to other animals; though fami&s;hed with hunger, he di&s;dains to feed on carrion. The eyes of the Eagle have the glare of tho&s;e of the Lion, and are nearly of the &s;ame colour; the claws are of the &s;ame &s;hape, and the cry of both is powerful and terrible; de&s;tined for war and plunder, they are equally fierce, bold, and untractable. Such is the re&s;emblance which that ingenious and fanciful wri|ter has pictured of the&s;e two noble animals; the characters of both are &s;triking and prominent, and hence the Eagle is &s;aid to extend his domi|nion over the birds, as the Lion over the quadru|peds.</P>
<P>The &s;ame writer al&s;o ob&s;erves, that in a &s;tate of nature, the Eagle never engages in a &s;olitary chace but when the female is confined to her eggs or her
<PB N="4" REF="36">
young: at this &s;ea&s;on the return of the &s;maller birds affords plenty of prey, and he can with ea&s;e provide for the &s;u&s;tenance of him&s;elf and his mate: at o|ther times they unite their exertions, and are al|ways &s;een clo&s;e together, or at a &s;hort di&s;tance from each other. Tho&s;e who have an opportunity of ob&s;erving their motions, &s;ay, that the one beats the bu&s;hes, whil&s;t the other, perched on an emi|nence, watches the e&s;cape of the prey. They of|ten &s;oar out of the reach of human &s;ight; and not|with&s;tanding the immen&s;e di&s;tance, their cry is &s;till heard, and then re&s;embles the barking of a &s;mall dog. Though a voracious bird, the Eagle can en|dure the want of &s;u&s;tenance for a long time. A common Eagle, caught in a fox trap, is &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed five whole weeks without the lea&s;t food, and did not appear &s;en&s;ibly weakened till towards the la&s;t week, after which a period was put to its exi&s;tence.</P>

</FIGURE> THE GOLDEN EAGLE, (<HI>Falco Chry&s;aetos,</HI> Linnaeus.&mdash;<HI>Le grand Aigle,</HI> Buffon.)</HEAD>
<P>IS the large&s;t of the genus: It mea&s;ures, from the point of the bill to the extremity of the toes,
<PB N="6" REF="38">
upwards of three feet; and in breadth, from wing to wing, above eight; and weighs from &s;ixteen to eighteen pounds. The male is &s;maller, and does not weigh more than twelve pounds. The bill is of a deep blue colour; the cere yellow; the eyes are large, deep &s;unk, and covered by a projecting brow; the iris is of a fine bright yel|low, and &s;parkles with uncommon lu&s;tre. The general colour is deep brown, mixed with tawny on the head and neck; the quills are chocolate, with white &s;hafts; the tail is black, &s;potted with a&s;h colour; the legs are yellow, and feathered down to the toes, which are very &s;caly; the claws are re|markably large; the middle one is two inches in length.&mdash;This noble bird is found in various parts of Europe; it abounds mo&s;t in the warmer regions, and has &s;eldom been met with farther north than the fifty-fifth degree of latitude. It is known to breed in the mountainous parts of Ireland; it lays three, and &s;ometimes four eggs, of which it &s;eldom happens that more than two are prolific. Mr Pen|nant &s;ays there are in&s;tances, though rare, of their having bred in Snowdon Hills. Mr Wallis, in his Natural Hi&s;tory of Northumberland, &s;ays, it former|ly had its aery on the highe&s;t and &s;teepe&s;t part of Cheviot. In the beginning of January, 1735, a very large one was &s;hot near Warkworth, which mea&s;ured, from point to point of its wings, eleven feet and a quarter.</P>

</FIGURE> THE RINGTAILED EAGLE. (<HI>Falco Fulvus.</HI> Lin.&mdash;<HI>L'Aigle Commun.</HI> Buff.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the common Eagle of Buffon, and, ac|cording to that author, includes two varieties, the brown and the black Eagle; they are both of the
<PB N="8" REF="40">
&s;ame brown colour, di&s;tingui&s;hed only by a deep|er &s;hade; and are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize. In both, the upper part of the head and neck is mixed with ru&s;t colour, and the ba&s;e of the larger feathers marked with white; the bill is of a dark horn co|lour, the cere of a bright yellow, the iris hazel, and between the bill and the eye there is a naked &s;kin of a dirty brown colour; the legs are feathered to the toes, which are yellow, and the claws black; the tail is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a white ring, which co|vers about two thirds of its length; the remaining part is black.</P>
<P>The Ringtailed Eagle is more numerous and diffu&s;ed than the Golden Eagle, and prefers more northern climates. It is found in France, Ger|many, Switzerland, Great Britain, and in America as far north as Hud&s;on's Bay.</P>

</FIGURE> THE WHITE-TAILED EAGLE. GREAT ERNE&mdash;CINEREOUS EAGLE. (<HI>Falco Albiulla,</HI> Lin.&mdash;<HI>Le grand Pygargue,</HI> Buff.)</HEAD>
<P><PB N="10" REF="42">OF this there appear to be three varieties, which differ chiefly in &s;ize, and con&s;i&s;t of the following: the great Erne, or Cinereous Eagle, of Latham and Pennant; the &s;mall Erne, or le&s;&s;er White-tailed Eagle; and the White-headed Erne, or Bald Eagle. The two fir&s;t are di&s;tingui&s;hed only by their &s;ize, and the la&s;t by the whitene&s;s of its head and neck.</P>
<P>The white-tailed Eagle is inferior in &s;ize to the Golden Eagle; the beak, cere, and eyes are of a pale yellow; the &s;pace between the beak and the eye is of a bluei&s;h colour, and thinly covered with hair; the &s;ides of the head and neck are of a pale a&s;h colour, mixed with reddi&s;h brown; the general colour of the plumage is brown, dark|e&s;t on the upper part of the head, neck, and back; the quill feathers are very dark; the brea&s;t is ir|regularly marked with white &s;pots; the tail is white; the legs, which are of a bright yellow, are feathered a little below the knees; the claws are black.</P>
<P>This bird inhabits all the northern parts of Europe, and is found in Scotland and many parts of Great-Britain; it is equal in &s;trength and vi|gour to the common Eagle, but more furious; and is &s;aid to drive its young ones from the ne&s;t, after having fed them only a very &s;hort time. It has commonly two or three young, and builds its ne&s;t upon lofty trees.</P>

<P>THIS bird is nearly as large as the Golden Eagle, mea&s;uring in length three feet and a half, but its expanded wings do not reach above &s;even feet.
<PB N="12" REF="44">
Its bill is large, much hooked, and of a bluei&s;h colour; its eye is yellow; a row of &s;trong bri&s;tly feathers hangs down from its under bill next to its throat, from whence it has been termed the beard|ed Eagle; the top of the head and back part of the neck are dark brown, inclining to black; the feathers on the back are variegated by a lighter brown, with dark edges; the &s;capulars are pale brown, the edges nearly white; the brea&s;t and belly whiti&s;h, with irregular &s;pots of brown; the tail feathers are dark brown; the outer edges of the exterior feathers whiti&s;h; the quill feathers and thighs are du&s;ky; the legs and feet yellow; the claws, which are large, and form a compleat &s;emicircle, are of a &s;hining black. It is found in various parts of Europe and America; it is &s;aid to lay only two eggs during the whole year, and frequently produces only one young one; it is however widely di&s;per&s;ed, and was met with at Botany I&s;land by Captain Cook. It lives chiefly on fi&s;h; its u&s;ual haunts are by the &s;ea-&s;hore; it al&s;o frequents the borders of large lakes and ri|vers; and is &s;aid to &s;ee &s;o di&s;tinctly in the dark, as to be able to pur&s;ue and catch its prey during the night. The &s;tory of the Eagle, brought to the ground after a &s;evere conflict with a cat which it had &s;eized and taken up into the air with its ta|lons, is very remarkable. Mr Barlow, who was an eye-witne&s;s of the fact, made a drawing of it, which he afterwards engraved.</P>

<P>The length of this bird is two feet; its breadth, from tip to tip, above five; its bill is black, with a blue cere, and its eye is yellow; the crown of its head is white, marked with oblong du&s;ky &s;pots; its cheeks, and all the under parts of its body, are white, &s;lightly &s;potted with brown on its brea&s;t; from the corner of each eye a &s;treak of brown ex|tends
<PB N="14" REF="46">
down the &s;ides of the neck toward the wing; the upper part of the body is brown; the two middle feathers of the tail are brown, the others are marked on the inner webs with alternate bars of brown and white; the legs are very &s;hort and thick, being only two inches and a quarter long, and two inches in circumference; they are of a pale blue colour; the claws black; the outer toe is larger than the inner one, and turns ea&s;ily back|ward, by which means this bird can more readily &s;ecure its &s;lippery prey.</P>
<P>Buffon ob&s;erves that the O&s;prey is the mo&s;t nu|merous of the large birds of prey, and is &s;cattered over the extent of Europe, from Sweden to Greece, and that it is found even in Egypt and Nigritia. Its haunts are on the &s;ea &s;hore, and on the bor|ders of rivers and lakes; its principal food is fi&s;h; it darts upon its prey with great rapidity, and with undeviating aim. The Italians compare its de|&s;cent upon the water to a piece of lead falling up|on that element, and di&s;tingui&s;h it by the name of Augui&s;ta Piumbina, or the Leaden Eagle. It builds its ne&s;t on the ground, among reeds, and lays three or four eggs, of an elliptical form, ra|ther le&s;s than tho&s;e of a hen. The Carolina and Cayenne O&s;preys are varieties of this &s;pecies.</P>

<P>M. BUFFON di&s;tingui&s;hes the Kites and the Buz|zards from the Eagles and Hawks by their habits and di&s;po&s;itions, which he compares to tho&s;e of the Vultures, and places them after tho&s;e birds. Though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trength, agility, and weapons to defend them&s;elves, they are cowardly, inactive, and &s;lothful; they will fly before a Sparrow-hawk, and when overtaken will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be

beaten, and even brought to the ground without re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Buzzard is about twenty inches in length, and in breadth four feet and a half; its bill is of a lead colour; eyes pale yellow; the upper parts of the body are of a du&s;ky brown colour; the wings and tail are marked with bars of a darker hue; the upper parts pale, variegated with a light red|di&s;h brown; the legs are yellow; claws black. This well-known bird is of a &s;edentary and indo|lent di&s;po&s;ition; it continues for many hours per|ched upon a tree or eminence, from whence it darts upon the game that comes within its reach; it feeds on birds, &s;mall quadrupeds, reptiles, and in&s;ects; its ne&s;t is con&s;tructed with &s;mall branches, lined in the in&s;ide with wool, and other &s;oft mate|rials; it lays two or three eggs, of a whiti&s;h co|lour, &s;potted with yellow; it feeds and tends its young with great a&s;&s;iduity. Ray affirms, that if the female be killed during the time of incubation, the male Buzzard takes the charge of them, and pa|tiently rears the young till they are able to pro|vide for them&s;elves. Birds of this &s;pecies are &s;ub|ject to greater variations than mo&s;t other birds, &s;carcely two being alike; &s;ome are entirely white, of others the head only is white, and others again are mottled with brown and white.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="54">
quills are dark brown; the legs yellow; and the claws black. It is common in England, and con|tinues with us the whole year: It is found in va|rious parts of Europe, in very northern latitudes, from whence before winter it retires towards E|gypt in great numbers; it is &s;aid to breed there, and return in April to Europe, where it breeds a &s;econd time, contrary to the nature of rapacious birds in general. The female lays two or three eggs of a whiti&s;h colour, &s;potted with pale yellow, and of a roundi&s;h form. Though the Kite weighs &s;omewhat le&s;s than three pounds, the extent of its wings is more than five feet; its flight is rapid, and it &s;oars very high in the air, frequently beyond the reach of our &s;ight,&mdash;yet at this di&s;tance it perceives its food di&s;tinctly, and de&s;cends upon its prey with irre&s;i&s;tible force; its attacks are confined to &s;mall animals and birds; it is particularly fond of young chickens, but the fury of their mother is generally &s;ufficient to drive away the robber.</P>

<P>THIS bird is &s;omewhat longer than the Buzzard, but &s;lenderer and more beautiful; its length is one foot ten inches; its bill is blue, tipped with black; cere green; eyes yellow; over each eye there is a whiti&s;h line; the head and all the upper parts of the body are of a deep brown colour, each &s;ide of the neck being irregularly marked with white; the brea&s;t and belly are white, with a number of wavy lines or bars of black; the tail is long, of an a&s;h
<PB N="24" REF="56">
colour, and cro&s;&s;ed with four or five du&s;ky bars; the legs are yellow, and the claws black; the wings are much &s;horter than the tail. M. de Buf|fon, who brought up two young birds of this kind, a male and a female, makes the following ob&s;erva|tions: That the Go&s;hawk, before it has &s;hed its fea|thers, that is, in its fir&s;t year, is marked on the brea&s;t and belly with longitudinal brown &s;pots; but after it has had two moultings they di&s;appear, and their place is occupied by tran&s;ver&s;e bars, which continue during the re&s;t of its life: He ob&s;erves further, that though the male was much &s;maller than the female, it was fairer and more vicious: The Go&s;hawk feeds on mice and &s;mall birds, and eagerly devours raw fle&s;h; it plucks the birds very neatly, and tears them into pieces before it eats them, but &s;wallows the pieces entire; and frequent|ly di&s;gorges the hair rolled up in &s;mall pellets.</P>
<P>The Go&s;hawk is found in France and Germany; it is not very common in this country, but is more frequent in Scotland; it is likewi&s;e common in North America, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Siberia: In Chine&s;e Tartary there is a variety which is mottled with brown and yellow. They are &s;aid to be u&s;ed by the Emperor of China in his &s;porting excur&s;ions, when he is u&s;ually attended by his grand falconer, and a thou&s;and of inferior rank. Every bird has a &s;ilver plate fa&s;tened to its foot, with the name of the falconer who had the charge of it, that in ca&s;e it &s;hould be lo&s;t it may be re&s;tored to the proper
<PB N="25" REF="57">
per&s;on; but if he &s;hould not be found, the bird is delivered to another officer called <HI>the guardian of lo&s;t birds,</HI> who, to make his &s;ituation known, erects his &s;tandard in a con&s;picuous place among the ar|my of hunters. In former times the cu&s;tom of carrying a hawk on the hand was confined to men of high di&s;tinction, &s;o that it was a &s;aying among the Wel&s;h, "you may know a gentleman by his hawk, hor&s;e, and greyhound." Even the ladies in tho&s;e times were partakers of this gallant &s;port, and have been repre&s;ented in &s;culpture with hawks on their hands. At pre&s;ent this noble diver&s;ion is wholly laid a&s;ide in this country; the advanced &s;tate of agriculture which every where prevails, and the con&s;equent improvement and inclo&s;ure of lands, would but ill accord with the pur&s;uits of the falconer, who requires a large and exten&s;ive range of country, where he may pur&s;ue his game without mole&s;tation to him&s;elf, or injury to his neighbour. The expence which attended this &s;port was very con&s;iderable, which confined it to princes and men of the highe&s;t rank. In the time of James I. Sir Thomas Mon&s;on is &s;aid to have given a thou&s;and pounds for a ca&s;t of hawks. In the reign of Ed|ward III. it was made felony to &s;teal a hawk; to take its eggs, even in a per&s;on's own ground, was puni&s;hable with impri&s;onment for a year and a day, together with a fine at the king's plea&s;ure. Such was the plea&s;ure our ance&s;tors took in this royal &s;port, and &s;uch were the means by which they en|deavoured
<PB N="26" REF="58">
to &s;ecure it.&mdash;Be&s;ides the bird ju&s;t de|&s;cribed, there are many other kinds which were formerly in high e&s;timation for the &s;ports of the field; the&s;e were principally the Jer-Falcon, the Falcon, the Lanner, the Sacre, the Hobby, the Ke&s;tril, and the Merlin: The&s;e are called the long-winged hawks, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Go&s;hawk, the Sparrowhawk, the Kite, and the Buzzard, which are of &s;horter wing, flower in their motions, more indolent, and le&s;s courageous than the others.</P>

<P>Naturali&s;ts have enumerated a great variety of Falcons: and in order to &s;well the li&s;t, they have introduced the &s;ame bird at different periods of its life; and have, not unfrequently, &s;ub&s;tituted acci|dental differences of climate as con&s;tituting perma|nent varieties; &s;o that, as Buffon ob&s;erves with his u&s;ual acutene&s;s, one would be apt to imagine that
<PB N="31" REF="63">
there were as many varieties of the Falcon as of the Pigeon, the Hen, and other dome&s;tic birds. In this way new &s;pecies have been introduced, and va|rieties multiplied without end: An over-anxious de&s;ire of noting all the minute differences exi&s;ting in this part of the works of nature has &s;ometimes led the too curious inquirer into unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;|tinctions, and has been the means of introducing confu&s;ion and irregularity into the &s;y&s;tems of orni|thologi&s;ts. Our countryman, Latham, makes twelve varieties of the common Falcon, of which one is a young Falcon, or yearling&mdash;another is the Haggard, or old Falcon&mdash;whil&s;t others differ only in &s;ome une&s;&s;ential point, ari&s;ing from age, &s;ex, or climate. Buffon, however, reduces the whole to two kinds&mdash;the Gentil, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the &s;ame with the common Falcon, differing only in &s;ea&s;on; and the Peregrine, or Pa&s;&s;enger Falcon. This la&s;t is rarely met with in Britain, and con&s;e|quently is but little known with us: It is about the &s;ize of the common Falcon; its bill is blue, black at the point; cere and irides yellow; the up|per parts of the body are elegantly marked with bars of blue and black; the brea&s;t is of a yel|lowi&s;h white, marked with a few &s;mall du&s;ky lines; the belly, thighs, and vent of a greyi&s;h white, cro&s;&s;ed with du&s;ky bands; the quills are du&s;ky, &s;potted with white; the tail is finely barred with blue and black; the legs are yellow; the claws black.</P>

<P>The Ke&s;trel is widely diffu&s;ed throughout Eu|rope, and is found in the more temperate parts of North America: It is a hand&s;ome bird, its &s;ight is acute, and its flight ea&s;y and graceful: It breeds in the hollows of trees, and in the holes of rocks, towers, and ruined buildings; it lays four or five eggs, of a pale reddi&s;h colour: Its food con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall birds, field mice, and reptiles: After it has &s;ecured its prey, it plucks the feathers very dex|terou&s;ly from the birds, but &s;wallows the mice en|tire, and di&s;charges the hair at the bill in the form of round balls. This bird is frequently &s;een ho|vering in the air, and fanning with its wings by a gentle motion, or wheeling &s;lowly round, at the &s;ame time watching for its prey, on which it &s;hoots like an arrow.

<HEAD>OF THE OWL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Owl is di&s;tingui&s;hed among birds of the ra|pacious kind by peculiar and &s;triking characters: Its outward appearance is not more &s;ingular than are its habits and di&s;po&s;itions; unable to bear the brighter light of the &s;un, the Owl retires to &s;ome ob&s;cure retreat, where it pa&s;&s;es the day in &s;ilence and ob&s;curity, but at the approach of evening, when all nature is de&s;irous of repo&s;e, and the &s;mal|ler animals, which are its principal food, are &s;eek|ing their ne&s;tling places, the Owl comes forth from its lurking holes in que&s;t of its prey. Its eyes are admirably adapted for this purpo&s;e, being &s;o form|ed as to di&s;tingui&s;h objects with greater facility in the du&s;k than in broad day-light: Its flight is ra|pid and &s;ilent during its nocturnal excur&s;ions, and it is then known only by its frightful and reiter|ated cries, with which it interrupts the &s;ilence of the night. During the day, the Owl is &s;eldom &s;een; but if forced from his retreat, his flight is broken and interrupted, and he is &s;ometimes at|tended by numbers of &s;mall birds of various kinds, who, &s;eeing his embarra&s;&s;ment, pur&s;ue him with ince&s;&s;ant cries, and torment him with their move|ments; the Jay, the Thru&s;h, the Blackbird, the Redbrea&s;t, and the Titmou&s;e all a&s;&s;emble to hur|ry and perplex him. During all this, the Owl remains perched upon the branches of a tree, and an&s;wers them only with aukward and in&s;ignifi|cant

<P>Nocturnal birds of prey are generally divided in|to two kinds&mdash;tho&s;e which have horns or ears, and tho&s;e which are earle&s;s or without horns; the&s;e horns con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall tufts of feathers &s;tanding up like ears on each &s;ide of the head, which may be erected or depre&s;&s;ed at the plea&s;ure of the animal; and in all probability are of u&s;e in directing the or|gans of hearing, which are very large, to their pro|per object. Both kinds agree in having their eyes &s;o formed as to be able to pur&s;ue their prey with much le&s;s light than other birds. The general character of the Owl is as follows: The eyes are large, and are &s;urrounded with a radiated circle of feathers, of which the eye it&s;elf is the center; the beak and talons are &s;trong and crooked; the body very &s;hort, but thick, and well covered with a coat of the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t delicate plumage; the ex|ternal edges of the outer quill feathers in general are &s;errated or finely toothed, which adds greatly to the &s;moothne&s;s and &s;ilence of its flight.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE SHRIKE.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t cla&s;s we &s;hall mention of birds of the rapacious kind is that of the Shrike, which, as M. Buffon ob&s;erves, though they are &s;mall and of a delicate form, yet their courage, their appetite for blood, and their hooked bill, entitle them to be ranked with the bolde&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;anguinary of the rapacious tribe. This genus has been variou&s;|ly placed in the &s;y&s;tems of naturali&s;ts; &s;ometimes it has been cla&s;&s;ed with the Falcons, &s;ometimes with the Pies, and has even been ranked with the harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive tribes of the Pa&s;&s;erine kind, to which indeed, in outward appearance at lea&s;t, it bears no &s;mall re&s;emblance. Conforma|ble, however, to the late&s;t arrangements, we have placed it in the rear of tho&s;e birds which live by rapine and plunder; and, like mo&s;t of the connec|ting links in the great chain of nature, it will be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s a middle quality, partaking of tho&s;e which are placed on each &s;ide of it, and making thereby an ea&s;y tran&s;ition from the one to the o|ther.</P>
<P>The Shrike genus is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the follow|ing characteri&s;tics: The bill is &s;trong, &s;traight at the ba&s;e, and hooked or bent towards the end; the upper mandible is notched near the tip, and the ba&s;e is furni&s;hed with bri&s;tles; it has no cere; the
<PB N="57" REF="89">
tongue is divided at the end; the outer toe is con|nected to the middle one as far as the fir&s;t joint. To the&s;e exterior marks we may add, that it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the mo&s;t undaunted courage, and will attack birds much larger and &s;tronger than it&s;elf, &s;uch as the Crow, the Magpie, and mo&s;t of the &s;maller kinds of Hawks; if any of the&s;e &s;hould fly near the place of its retreat, the Shrike darts upon them with loud cries, attacks the invader, and drives it from its ne&s;t. The parent birds will &s;ometimes join on &s;uch occa&s;ions; and there are few birds that will venture to abide the conte&s;t. Shrikes will chace all the &s;mall birds upon the wing, and &s;ome|times will venture to attack Partridges, and even young hares. Thru&s;hes, Blackbirds, and &s;uch like, are their common prey; they fix on them with their talons, &s;plit the &s;kull with their bill, and feed on them at lei&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>BIRDS OF THE PIE KIND</HEAD>
<P>CONSTITUTE the next order in the arrangement of the feathered part of the creation; they con&s;i&s;t of a numerous and irregular tribe, widely differing from each other in their habits, appetites, and man|ners, as well as in their form, &s;ize, and appearance. In general they are noi&s;y, re&s;tle&s;s, and loquacious, and of all other kinds contribute the lea&s;t towards &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities or the plea&s;ures of man. At the head of the&s;e we &s;hall place the Crow and its affinities, well known, by its &s;ooty plumage and croaking note, from every other tribe of the fea|thered race. Birds of this kind are found in every part of the known world, from Greenland to the Cape of Good Hope; and though generally di&s;|liked for their di&s;gu&s;ting and indi&s;criminating vo|racity, yet in many re&s;pects they may be &s;aid to be of &s;ingular benefit to mankind, not only by de|vouring putrid fle&s;h, but principally by de&s;troy|ing great quantities of noxious in&s;ects, worms, and reptiles. Rooks, in particular, are fond of the e|rucae of the hedge-chafer, or che&s;nut brown beetle, for which they &s;earch with indefatigable pains.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e in&s;ects appear in hot weather, in formidable num|bers, di&s;robing the fields and trees of their verdure, blo&s;&s;oms, and fruit, &s;preading de&s;olation and de&s;truction wherever they go.&mdash; They appeared in great numbers in Ireland during a hot &s;um|mer, and committed great ravages. In the year 1747 whole meadows and corn-fields were de&s;troyed by them in Suffolk.&mdash; The decrea&s;e of rookeries in that county was thought to be the occa&s;ion of it.

They are often accu&s;ed of feeding on the corn ju&s;t after it has been &s;own, and various contrivances have been made both to kill and frighten them a|way; but, in our e&s;timation, the advantages deri|ved from the de&s;truction which they make among grubs, earth-worms, and noxious in&s;ects of various kinds, will greatly overpay the injury done to the future harve&s;t by the &s;mall quantity of corn they may de&s;troy in &s;earching after their favorite food. In general they are &s;agacious, active, and faithful to each other: They live in pairs, and their mu|tual attachment is con&s;tant. They are a clamour|ous race, mo&s;tly build in trees, and form a kind of &s;ociety, in which there appears &s;omething like a re|gular government; a centinel watches for the ge|neral &s;afety, and give notice on the appearance of danger. On the approach of an enemy or a &s;tran|ger they act in concert, and drive him away with repeated attacks. On the&s;e occa&s;ions they are as bold as they are artful and cunning, in avoiding the &s;malle&s;t appearance of real danger; of this the di&s;|appointed fowler has frequently occa&s;ion to take notice, on &s;eeing the birds fly away before he can draw near enough to &s;hoot them; from this cir|cum&s;tance it has been &s;aid that they di&s;cover their

<P>The general characters of this kind are well known, and are chiefly as follow:&mdash;The bill is &s;trong, and has a &s;light curvature along the top of the upper mandible; the edges are thin, and &s;harp or cultrated; in many of the &s;pecies there is a &s;mall notch near the tip; the no&s;trils are covered with bri&s;tles; tongue divided at the end; three toes forward, one behind, the middle toe connected to the outer as far as the fir&s;t joint.</P>

<PB N="72" REF="104">
to ob&s;erve that they are u&s;eful in prevent|ing a too great increa&s;e of that de&s;tructive in&s;ect the chafer or dor-beetle, and by that means make large recompen&s;e for the depredations they may occa&s;ionally make on the corn fields. Rooks are gregarious, and fly in immen&s;e flocks at morning and evening to and from their roo&s;ting places in que&s;t of food. During the breeding time they live together in large &s;ocieties, and build their ne&s;ts on trees clo&s;e to each other, frequently in the mid&s;t of large and populous towns. The&s;e rook|eries, however, are often the &s;cenes of bitter con|te&s;ts, the new comers being frequently driven a|way by the old inhabitants, their half-built ne&s;ts torn in pieces, and the unfortunate couple forced to begin their work anew in &s;ome more undi&s;turbed &s;ituation;&mdash;of this we had a remarkable in&s;tance in Newca&s;tle. In the year 1783 a pair of Rooks, af|ter an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in a rookery at no great di&s;tance from the Ex|change, were compelled to abandon the attempt, and take refuge on the &s;pire of that building, and altho' con&s;tantly interrupted by other Rooks, they built their ne&s;t on the top of the vane, and brought forth their young, undi&s;turbed by the noi&s;e of the populace below them; the ne&s;t and its inhabitants were con&s;equently turned about by every change of the wind.

The ne&s;t &s;he chu&s;es for this purpo&s;e is generally &s;elected from the fol|lowing, viz. The Hedge-&s;parrow, the Water-wag-tail, the Titlark, the Yellow-hammer, the Green Linnet, or the Whinchat. Of the&s;e it has been ob&s;erved that &s;he &s;hews a much greater partiality to the Hedge-&s;parrow than to any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We owe the following account of the economy of this &s;ingular bird in the di&s;po&s;al of its egg, to the accurate ob&s;ervations of Mr Edward Jenner, communicated to the Royal Society, and publi&s;hed in the 78th volume of their tran&s;actions, part II.

This intru&s;ion often occa&s;ions &s;ome di&s;compo&s;ure, for the old Hedge-&s;parrow at intervals, whil&s;t &s;he is &s;itting, not only throws out &s;ome of her own eggs, but
<PB N="106" REF="138">
&s;ometimes injures them in &s;uch a way that they become addle, &s;o that it frequently happens that not more than two or three of the parent bird's eggs are hatched with that of the Cuckoo; and what is very remarkable, it has never been ob&s;er|ved that the Hedge-&s;parrow has either thrown out or injured the egg of the Cuckoo. When the Hedge-&s;parrow has &s;at her u&s;ual time, and di&s;en|gaged the young Cuckoo and &s;ome of her own off|&s;pring from the &s;hell, her own young ones, and any of her eggs that remain unhatched, are &s;oon turned out, the young Cuckoo remaining in full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ne&s;t, and the &s;ole object of the future care of her fo&s;ter parent. The young birds are not previou&s;ly killed, nor the eggs demoli&s;hed, but all are left to peri&s;h together, either entangled in the bu&s;h which contains the ne&s;t, or lying on the ground under it. Mr Jenner next proceeds to ac|count for this &s;eemingly unnatural circum&s;tance; and as what he has advanced is the re&s;ult of his own repeated ob&s;ervations, we &s;hall give it nearly in his own words. "On the 18th June, 1787, Mr J. examined the ne&s;t of a Hedge-&s;parrow, which then contained a Cuckoo's and three Hedge-&s;par|row's eggs. On in&s;pecting it the day following, the bird had hatched, but the ne&s;t then contained only a young Cuckoo and one young Hedge-&s;par|row. The ne&s;t was placed &s;o near the extremity of a hedge that he could di&s;tinctly &s;ee what was going forward in it; and, to his great a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="107" REF="139">
he &s;aw the young Cuckoo, though &s;o lately hatched, in the act of turning out the young Hedge-&s;parrow. The mode of accompli&s;hing this was cu|rious: The little animal, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of its rump and wings, contrived to get the bird upon its back, and making a lodgement for its burden by elevating its elbows, clambered backwards with it up the &s;ide of the ne&s;t till it reached the top, where re&s;ting for a moment, it threw off its load with a jerk, and quite di&s;engaged it from the ne&s;t: After remaining a &s;hort time in this &s;ituation, and feeling about with the extremities of its wings, as if to be convinced that the bu&s;ine&s;s was properly executed, it dropped into the ne&s;t again. Mr J. made &s;ever|al experiments in different ne&s;ts by repeatedly put|ting in an egg to the young Cuckoo, which he al|ways found to be di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;ame manner. It is very remarkable, that nature &s;eems to have provided for the &s;ingular di&s;po&s;ition of the Cuckoo in its formation at this period, for, different from other newly hatched birds, its back from the &s;ca|pulae downwards is very broad, with a con&s;iderable depre&s;&s;ion in the middle, which &s;eems intended by nature for the purpo&s;e of giving a more &s;ecure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-&s;parrow, or its young one, while the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the ne&s;t. When it is above twelve days old this cavity is quite fil|led up, the back a&s;&s;umes the &s;hape of ne&s;tling birds in general, and at that time the di&s;po&s;ition for turn|ing
<PB N="108" REF="140">
out its companion entirely cea&s;es. The &s;mall|ne&s;s of the Cuckoo's egg, which, in general, is le&s;s than that of the Hou&s;e-&s;parrow,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Cuckoo eggs which have come under out ob&s;ervation were nearly of the &s;ize of tho&s;e of the Thru&s;h.</NOTE> is another circum|&s;tance to be attended to in this &s;urprizing tran&s;ac|tion, and &s;eems to account for the parent Cuckoo's depo&s;iting it in the ne&s;ts of &s;uch &s;mall birds only as have been mentioned. If &s;he were to do this in the ne&s;t of a bird which produced a larger egg, and con&s;equently a larger ne&s;tling, its de&s;ign would pro|bably be fru&s;trated; the young Cuckoo would be unequal to the ta&s;k of becoming &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the ne&s;t, and might fall a &s;acrifice to the &s;uperior &s;trength of its partners.</P>
<P>Mr Jenner ob&s;erves, that it &s;ometimes happens that two Cuckoos' eggs are depo&s;ited in the &s;ame ne&s;t, and gives the following in&s;tance of one which fell under his ob&s;ervation. Two Cuckoos and a Hedge-&s;parrow were hatched in the &s;ame ne&s;t, one Hedge-&s;parrow's egg remaining unhatched: In a few hours a conte&s;t began between the Cuckoos for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ne&s;t, which continued undeter|mined till the afternoon of the following day, when one of them, which was &s;omewhat &s;uperior in &s;ize, turned out the other, together with the young Hedge-&s;parrow and the unhatched egg. This con|te&s;t, he adds, was very remarkable: The combat|ants alternately appeared to have the advantage, as
<PB N="109" REF="141">
each carried the other &s;everal times nearly to the top of the ne&s;t, and then &s;unk down again oppre&s;|&s;ed with the weight of its burthen: till at length, after various efforts, the &s;tronge&s;t prevailed, and was afterwards brought up by the Hedge-&s;parrow. It would carry us beyond the limits of our work to give a detail of the ob&s;ervations made by our in|genious inquirer; we mu&s;t therefore refer our read|er to the work it&s;elf, in which he will find a vari|ety of matter entirely new re&s;pecting this &s;ingular bird, who&s;e hi&s;tory has for ages been enveloped in fable, and mixed with unaccountable &s;tories found|ed in ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition. At what period the young Cuckoos leave this country is not pre|ci&s;ely known; Mr Jenner &s;uppo&s;es they go off in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and leave us as &s;oon as they are capable of taking care of them&s;elves. That &s;ome of them remain here in a torpid &s;tate we have already had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the introduction.</NOTE> but this cannot be the ca&s;e with the greater part of tho&s;e which leave this coun|try and retire to milder climates, to avoid the ri|gours of winter. Buffon mentions &s;everal in&s;tances of young Cuckoos having been kept in cages, which, probably for want of proper nutriment, did not &s;ur|vive the winter. We knew of one which was pre&s;er|ved through the winter by being fed with worms, in&s;ects, &s;oaked bread, and &s;mall pieces of fle&s;h. The plumage of the Cuckoo varies greatly at different
<PB N="110" REF="142">
periods of its life. In young Cuckoos the bill, legs, and tail are nearly the &s;ame as in the old ones; the eye is blue; the throat, neck, brea&s;t, and belly are elegantly barred with a dark brown on a light ground; the back is of a lead colour, mixed with brown, and faintly barred with white; the tail feathers are irregularly marked with black, light brown, and white, and tipped with white; its legs are yellow.</P>

<HEAD>THE WOODPECKERS.</HEAD>
<P>OF the&s;e only three or four kinds are found in the&s;e kingdoms. Their characters are &s;triking and their manners &s;ingular. The bill is large, &s;trong, and fitted for its employment; the end of it is formed like a wedge, with which it pierces the bark of trees and bores into the wood, in which its food is lodged. Its neck is &s;hort and thick, and furni&s;hed with powerful mu&s;cles, which enable it to &s;trike with &s;uch force as to be heard at a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance; its tongue is long and taper; at the end of it there is a hard bony &s;ub&s;tance, which penetrates into the crevices of trees, and extracts the in&s;ects and their eggs, which are lodged there; the tail con&s;i&s;ts of ten &s;tiff, &s;harp-pointed feathers bent inwards, by which it &s;ecures it&s;elf on the trunks of trees while in &s;earch of food; for this purpo&s;e its feet are &s;hort and thick, and its toes, which are placed two forward and two backward, are armed with &s;trong hooked claws, by which it clings firmly and creeps up and down in all direc|tions. M. Buffon, with his u&s;ual warmth of ima|gination, thus de&s;cribes the &s;eemingly dull and &s;o|litary life of the Woodpecker.</P>
<P><Q>Of all the birds which earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by &s;poil, none leads a life &s;o laborious and painful as the Woodpecker: Nature has condemned it to ince&s;&s;ant toil and &s;lavery. While others free|ly
<PB N="115" REF="147">
employ their courage or addre&s;s, and either &s;hoot on rapid wing or lurk in clo&s;e ambu&s;h, the Woodpecker is con&s;trained to drag out an in&s;ipid exi&s;tence in boring the bark and hard fibres of trees to extract its humble prey. Nece&s;&s;ity ne|ver &s;uffers any intermi&s;&s;ion of its labours, never grants an interval of &s;ound repo&s;e; often during the night it &s;leeps in the &s;ame painful po&s;ture as in the fatigues of the day. It never &s;hares the &s;ports of the other inhabitants of the air, it joins not their vocal concerts, and its wild cries and &s;addening tones, while they di&s;turb the &s;ilence of the fore&s;t, expre&s;s con&s;traint and effort: Its movements are quick, its ge&s;tures full of inquie|tude, its looks coar&s;e and vulgar; it &s;huns all &s;o|ciety, even that of its own kind; and when it is prompted to &s;eek a companion, its appetite is not &s;oftened by delicacy of feeling.</Q></P>

The female differs from the male in not having the red mark from the corner of the mouth; &s;he makes her ne&s;t in the hollow of a tree, fifteen or twenty feet from the ground. Buffon ob&s;erves that both male and female labour by turns in boring through the living part of the wood, &s;ometimes to a con&s;iderable depth, until they pe|netrate to that which is decayed and rotten, where &s;he lays five or &s;ix eggs, of a greeni&s;h colour, mark|ed with &s;mall black &s;pots.</P>
<P>The Green Woodpecker is &s;een more frequently on the ground than the other kinds, particularly where there are ant-hills. It in&s;erts its long tongue into the holes through which the ants i&s;&s;ue, and draws out the&s;e in&s;ects in abundance. Sometimes, with its feet and bill, it makes a breach in the ne&s;t, and devours them at its ea&s;e, together with their eggs.

</FIGURE> THE CROSS-BILL. SHEL-APPLE. (<HI>Loxia Curviro&s;tra,</HI> Lin,&mdash;<HI>Le bec Croi&s;e~,</HI> Buff.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS bird is about the &s;ize of a Lark, being nearly &s;even inches in length: It is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the peculiar formation of its bill, the upper and under mandible curving in oppo&s;ite directions, and cro&s;&s;ing each other at the points;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ingular con&s;truction of the bill is con&s;idered by M. Buffon as a defect or error in nature, rather than a permanent feature, merely becau&s;e that, in &s;ome &s;ubjects, the bill cro&s;&s;es to the left, and in others to the right, ari&s;ing, as he &s;uppo&s;es, from the way in which the bird has been accu&s;tomed to u&s;e its bill, by employing either the one &s;ide or the other to lay hold of its food. This mode of rea&s;oning, however, mu&s;t. prove very de|fective, when we con&s;ider that this peculiarity is confined to a &s;ingle &s;pecies, no other bird in nature being &s;ubject to a &s;imilar variation from the general con&s;truction, although there are many other birds which feed upon the &s;ame kinds of hard &s;ub&s;tances, which, neverthele&s;s, do not experience any change in the for|mation and &s;tructure of their bills; neither has the argument, drawn from the &s;uppo&s;ed exuberance of growth in the bills of the&s;e birds, any better foundation, as that likewi&s;e may be ap|plied to other birds, and the &s;ame que&s;tion will occur&mdash;namely, Why is not the &s;ame effect produced? This ingenious but fan|ciful writer, in the further pro&s;ecution of his argument, &s;eems to increa&s;e the difficulties in which it is involved. He ob&s;erves, "that the bill, hooked upwards and downwards, and bent in oppo&s;ite directions, &s;eems to have been formed for the purpo&s;e of detaching the &s;cales of the fir cones and obtaining the &s;eeds lodg|ed beneath them, which are the principal food of the bird. It rai&s;es each &s;cale with its lower mandible, and breaks it with the upper." We think there needs no &s;tronger argument than this to prove, that Nature, in all her operations, works by various means; and although the&s;e are not always clear to our limited under&s;tandings, the good of all her creatures is the one great end to which they are all directed.</NOTE> its eyes are ha|zel;

<P>The Cro&s;s-bill is an inhabitant of the colder cli|mates, and has been found as far as Greenland.

It &s;ometimes is met with in great numbers in this country, but its vi&s;its are not regular,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have met with it on the top of Black&s;ton-edge, between Rochdale and Halifax, in the month of Augu&s;t.</NOTE> as in &s;ome years it is rarely to be &s;een. Its principal food is &s;aid to be the &s;eeds of the pine tree; it is ob&s;erved to hold the cone in one claw like the Parrot, and when kept in a cage has all the actions of that bird, climbing by means of its hooked bill, from the lower to the up|per bars of its cage. From its mode of &s;crambling and the beauty of its colours, it has been called by &s;ome the German Parrot. The female is &s;aid to begin to build as early as January; &s;he places her ne&s;t under the bare branches of the pine tree, fix|ing it with the re&s;inous matter which exudes from that tree, and be&s;mearing it on the out&s;ide with the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o that the melted &s;now or rain cannot penetrate it.</P>

The&s;e birds do not perch, but continue always on the ground, and run about like Larks, to which they are &s;imi|lar in &s;ize, manners, and in the length of their hind claws, from whence they have been ranged with birds of that cla&s;s by &s;ome authors, but with more propriety have been referred to the Buntings, from the peculiar &s;tructure of their bill. They are &s;aid to &s;ing &s;weetly, &s;itting on the ground. On their fir&s;t arrival in this country they are very lean; but &s;oon grow fat, and are con&s;idered as delicious food. The Highlands of Scotland abound with them.</P>

white upon it; the upper tail coverts are yellow; the tail is a little forked, the two outermo&s;t feathers are white, the third black, tipped with white, the re&s;t wholly black; the legs are &s;hort and black; the hind claws almo&s;t as long, but more bent than tho&s;e of the Lark.</P>
<P>Our figure and de&s;cription of this bird are taken from one which was caught in the high moory grounds above Shotley-Kirk, in the county of Northumberland. We are perfectly of opinion, with Mr Pennant, that this and the former are the &s;ame bird in their &s;ummer and winter dre&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Arctic Zoology, Number 222.</NOTE> Lin|naeus, who mu&s;t have been well acquainted with this &s;pecies, compri&s;es them under one, and &s;ays that they vary, not only from the &s;ea&s;on, but accor|ding to their age: It is certain that no birds of the &s;ame &s;pecies differ from each other more than they; among&s;t multitudes, that are frequently ta|ken, &s;carcely two being alike. Mr Pennant &s;up|po&s;es, with great probability, that the &s;warms which annually vi&s;it the northern parts of our i&s;|land arrive from Lapland and Iceland, and make the i&s;les of Ferro, Shetland, and the Orkneys, their re&s;ting-places during the pa&s;&s;age. In the winter of 1778&mdash;9 they came in &s;uch multiludes into Bir|&s;a, one of the Orkney i&s;les, as to cover the whole barony; yet, of all the numbers, it could hardly
<PB N="152" REF="184">
be di&s;covered that any two of them agreed perfect|ly in colours. It is probable that the Mountain Bunting, or Le&s;&s;er Mountain Finch of Pennant and Latham, is the &s;ame bird in a &s;omewhat different dre&s;s; it has been &s;ometimes found in the more &s;outhern parts of England, where the little &s;tran|ger would be noticed, and without duly attending to its di&s;tingui&s;hing characters, has been con&s;idered as forming a di&s;tinct kind, and adding one more to the numerous varieties of the feathered tribes.&mdash; We have frequently had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, how difficult it is to avoid falling into errors of this &s;ort; the changes which frequently take place in the &s;ame bird, at different periods of its age, as well as from change of food, climate, or the like, are &s;o con&s;iderable, as often to puzzle, and &s;ome|times to mi&s;lead, the mo&s;t experienced ornitholo|gi&s;t; much caution is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the&s;e deceitful appearances; le&s;t, by mul|tiplying the &s;pecies beyond the bounds which na|ture has pre&s;cribed, we thereby introduce confu&s;ion into our &s;y&s;tem; and, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying the at|tentive inquirer, we &s;hall only bewilder and per|plex him in his re&s;earches into nature.</P>

behind each eye; &s;he is al&s;o much plainer and duller in her whole plumage. In whatever coun|try the Sparrow is &s;ettled, it is never found in de|&s;ert places, or at a di&s;tance from the dwellings of man: It does not, like other birds, &s;helter it&s;elf in woods and fore&s;ts, or &s;eek its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in uninha|bited plains, but is a re&s;ident in towns and villages; it follows &s;ociety, and lives at its expence; gra|naries, barns, court-yards, pigeon-hou&s;es, and in &s;hort all places where grain is &s;cattered, are its fa|vorite re&s;orts. It is &s;urely &s;aying too much of this poor pro&s;cribed &s;pecies to &s;um up its character in the words of the Count de Buffon:&mdash;
<Q>It is ex|tremely de&s;tructive, its plumage is entirely u&s;e|le&s;s, its fle&s;h indifferent food, its notes grating to the ear, and its familiarity and petulance di&s;gu&s;t|ing.</Q>
But let us not condemn a whole &s;pecies of animals becau&s;e, in &s;ome in&s;tances, we have found them trouble&s;ome or inconvenient. Of this we are &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible; but the u&s;es to which they are &s;ub&s;ervient, in the grand economical di&s;|tribution of nature, we cannot &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;certain. We have already ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See introduction.</NOTE> that, in the de&s;truction of caterpillars, they are eminently &s;erviceable to vegetation, and in this re&s;pect alone there is rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ufficiently repay the de&s;truction they may make in the produce of the garden or the field. The great table of nature is &s;pread
<PB N="156" REF="188">
out alike to all, and is amply &s;tored with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the various fa|milies of the earth; it is owing to the &s;uperior in|du&s;try of man that he is enabled to appropriate &s;o large a portion of the be&s;t gifts of providence for his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and comfort; let him not then think it wa&s;te, that, in &s;ome in&s;tances, creatures in|ferior to him in rank are permitted to partake with him, nor let him grudge them their &s;canty pit|tance; but, con&s;idering them only as the ta&s;ters of his full meal, let him endeavour to imitate their chearfulne&s;s, and lift up his heart in grateful effu|&s;ions to HIM, "who filleth all things living with plenteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>The Sparrow never leaves us, but is familiar to the eye at all times, even in the mo&s;t crowded and bu&s;y parts of a town: It builds its ne&s;t under the eaves of hou&s;es, in holes of walls, and often about churches; it is made of hay, carele&s;sly put toge|ther, and lined with feathers: The female lays five or &s;ix eggs, of a reddi&s;h white colour, &s;potted with brown; &s;he has generally three broods in the year, from whence the multiplication of the &s;pecies mu&s;t be immen&s;e. Though familiar, the Sparrow is &s;aid to be a crafty bird, ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;nares laid to entrap it. In autumn prodigious flocks of them are &s;een every where, both in town and country; they often mix with other birds, and not unfrequently partake with the Pigeons or the poultry, in &s;pite of every precaution to prevent
<PB N="157" REF="189">
them. The Sparrow is &s;ubject to great varieties of plumage: In the Briti&s;h and Leverian Mu&s;eums there are &s;everal white ones, with yellow eyes and bills, others more or le&s;s mixed with brown, and &s;ome entirely black: A pair of white Sparrows were &s;ent us by Mr Walter Trevelyan, of St. John's College, Cambridge.&mdash;This bird, as &s;een in large and &s;moaky towns, is generally &s;ooty and unplea&s;ing in its appearance; but, among barns and &s;tack-yards, the cock bird exhibits a very great variety in his plumage, and is far from being the lea&s;t beautiful of our Briti&s;h Birds.</P>

wants the red upon the brea&s;t; her plumage in general is not &s;o vivid, and inclines to green; in other re&s;pects it is not much unlike the male.</P>
<P>This beautiful little bird is every where well known; it begins its &s;hort and frequently-repeated warble very early in the &s;pring, and continues till about the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice, after which it is no more heard. It is a lively bird, and perpetually in mo|tion, and this circum&s;tance has given ri&s;e to the proverb, "<HI>as gay as a Chaffinch.</HI>" Its ne&s;t is con&s;tructed with much art, of &s;mall fibres, roots, and mo&s;s, and lined with wool, hair, and feathers; the female lays generally five or &s;ix eggs, of a pale reddi&s;h colour, &s;prinkled with dark &s;pots, princi|pally at the larger end. The male is very a&s;&s;idu|ous in his attendance during the time of hatch|ing, &s;eldom &s;traying far from the place, and then only to procure food. Chaffinches &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on &s;mall &s;eeds of various kinds, they likewi&s;e eat caterpillars and in&s;ects, with which they al&s;o feed their young. They are &s;eldom kept in cages, as their &s;ong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no variety, and they are not very apt in learning the notes of other birds. The males frequently maintain ob&s;tinate combats, and fight till one of them is vanqui&s;hed and compelled to give way. In Sweden the&s;e birds perform a partial migration; the females collect in va&s;t flocks the latter end of September, and, leaving their mates, &s;pread them&s;elves through various parts of
<PB N="162" REF="194">
Europe: The males continue in Sweden, and are again joined by their females, who return in great numbers, about the beginning of April, to their wonted haunts. With us, both males and females continue the whole year. Mr White, in his Hi&s;|tory of Selborne, ob&s;erves, that great flocks &s;ome|times appear in that neighbourhood about Chri&s;t|mas, and that they are almo&s;t entirely hens. It is difficult to account for &s;o &s;ingular a circum&s;tance as the parting of the two &s;exes in this in&s;tance; we would &s;uppo&s;e that the males, being more hardy and better able to endure the rigours of the nor|thern winters, are content to remain in the coun|try, and pick up &s;uch fare as they can find, whil&s;t the females &s;eek for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in more temperate regions.</P>

Like the Goldfinch, it may ea|&s;ily be taught to draw up its little bucket with wa|ter and food. Its food con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of &s;eeds; it drinks frequently, and &s;eems fond of throwing wa|ter over its feathers. It breeds freely with the Ca|nary. When a Si&s;kin is paired with the hen Ca|nary, he is a&s;&s;iduous in his attention to his mate, carrying materials for the ne&s;t, and arranging them; and, during the time of incubation, regularly &s;up|plying the female with food.

<P>This bird is very well known, being common in every part of Europe; it builds its ne&s;t in low bu&s;hes; the out&s;ide is made up of dried gra&s;s, roots, and mo&s;s; within it is lined with hair and wool: The female lays four or five eggs, of a pale blue colour, &s;potted with brown at the larger end. She breeds generally twice in the year. The &s;ong of the Linnet is beautiful and &s;weetly varied; its manners are gentle, and its di&s;po&s;ition docile; it ea&s;ily adopts the &s;ongs of other birds, when con|fined with them, and in &s;ome in&s;tances has been &s;aid to pronounce words with great di&s;tinctne&s;s. This we con&s;ider as a perver&s;ion of its talents, and &s;ub&s;tituting imperfect and forced accents, which have neither charms nor beauty, in the room of the free and varied modulations of unin&s;tructed na|ture. Linnets are frequently found in flocks; du|ring winter, they feed on various &s;orts of &s;eeds, and are &s;aid to be particularly fond of lint&s;eed, from whence they derive their name.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE LARK.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the various kinds of &s;inging birds with which this country abounds, there is none more eminently con&s;picuous than tho&s;e of the Lark kind. In&s;tead of retiring to woods and deep re|ce&s;&s;es, or lurking in thickets, where it may be heard without being &s;een, the Lark is &s;een abroad in the fields; it is the only bird which chaunts on the wing, and as it &s;oars beyond the reach of our &s;ight, pours forth the mo&s;t melodious &s;trains, which may be di&s;tinctly heard at that amazing di&s;tance. &mdash;The great poet of nature thus beautifully de|&s;cribes it as the leader of the general chorus:
<Q><L>&mdash;Up &s;prings the Lark,</L>
<L>Shrill-voiced and loud, the me&s;&s;enger of morn;</L>
<L>'Ere yet the &s;hadows fly, he mounted &s;ings</L>
<L>Amid the dawning clouds, and from their haunts</L>
<L>Calls up the tuneful nations.</L></Q></P>
<P>From the peculiar con&s;truction of the hind claws, which are very long and &s;traight, Larks generally re&s;t upon the ground; tho&s;e which frequent trees perch only on the larger branches: They all build their ne&s;ts upon the ground, which expo&s;es them to the depredations of the &s;maller voracious kinds of animals, &s;uch as the Weazel, Stoat, &amp;c. which de&s;troy great numbers of them. The Cuckoo likewi&s;e, which makes no ne&s;t of its own, frequent|ly &s;ub&s;titutes its eggs in the place of theirs.&mdash;The

general characters of this &s;pecies are thus de&s;cri|bed:&mdash;The bill is &s;traight and &s;lender, bending a little towards the end, which is &s;harp-pointed; the no&s;trils are covered with feathers and bri&s;tles; the tongue is cloven at the end; tail &s;omewhat fork|ed; the toes divided to the origin&mdash;claw of the hind toe very long, and almo&s;t &s;traight; the fore claws very &s;hort, and &s;lightly curved.</P>

<P>LENGTH near &s;even inches: Bill du&s;ky, under mandible &s;omewhat yellow; eyes hazel; over each eye there is a pale &s;treak, which extends to the bill, and round the eye on the under &s;ide; on the upper parts of the body the feathers are of a reddi&s;h brown colour, dark in the middle, with pale edges; the fore part of the neck is of a reddi&s;h white, da&s;h|ed with brown; brea&s;t, belly, and thighs white; the quills brown, with pale edges; tail the &s;ame, and &s;omewhat forked, the two middle feathers dark|e&s;t, the outermo&s;t white on the outer edge; the legs du&s;ky. In &s;ome of our &s;pecimens the feathers on the top of the head were long, and formed a &s;ort

<P>The Lark commences its &s;ong early in the &s;pring, and is heard mo&s;t in the morning: It ri&s;es in the air almo&s;t perpendicularly and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;prings, and hovers at a va&s;t height; its de&s;cent, on the contrary, is in an oblique direction, unle&s;s it is threatened by birds of prey, or attracted by its mate, and on the&s;e occa&s;ions it drops like a &s;tone It makes its ne&s;t on the ground, between two clods of earth, and lines it with dried gra&s;s and roots; the female lays four or five eggs, of a greyi&s;h brown colour, marked with darker &s;pots; &s;he generally has two broods in the year, and &s;its only about fif|teen days; as &s;oon as the young have e&s;caped from the &s;hell, the attachment of the parent bird &s;eems to increa&s;e; &s;he flutters over their heads, directs all their motions, and is ever ready to &s;creen them from danger. The Lark is almo&s;t univer&s;ally dif|fu&s;ed throughout Europe; it is every where ex|tremely prolific, and in &s;ome places the prodigious numbers that are frequently caught are truly a&s;to|ni&s;hing. In Germany there is an exci&s;e upon them, Which has produced, according to Key&s;ler, the &s;um of 6000 dollars yearly to the city of Leip&s;ic alone. Mr Pennant &s;ays, the neighbourhood of Dun&s;table is famous for the great numbers of the&s;e birds found
<PB N="180" REF="212">
there, and that 4000 dozen have been taken be|tween September and February for the London markets. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the great havock made among&s;t the&s;e birds, they are extremely nu|merous. The winter is the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for taking them, as they are then very fat, being almo&s;t con|&s;tantly on the ground, feeding in great flocks; whereas in &s;ummer they are very lean; they then always go in pairs, eat &s;paringly, and &s;ing ince&s;|&s;antly while on the wing.</P>

the legs pale du&s;ky brown; its hind claws, though &s;horter and more crooked than tho&s;e of the Sky|lark, &s;ufficiently mark its kind: It builds its ne&s;t on the ground, in &s;olitary &s;pots, and conceals it be|neath a turf; the female lays five eggs, marked with brown near the larger end.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring the cock-bird &s;ometimes perches on a tall branch, &s;inging with much emotion: At intervals he ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable height, hovers a few &s;econds, and drops almo&s;t on the &s;ame &s;pot, continuing to &s;ing all the time; his tones are &s;oft, clear, and harmonious. In the winter its cry is &s;aid to re&s;emble that of the gra&s;hopper, but is ra|ther &s;tronger and &s;hriller: It has been called the Pipit Lark from its &s;mall &s;hrill cry, and in German Piep-lerche for the &s;ame rea&s;on. Mr White ob|&s;erves, that its note &s;eems clo&s;e to a per&s;on, though at an hundred yards di&s;tance; and when clo&s;e to the ear, &s;eems &s;carce louder than when a great way off: It &s;kulks in hedges and thick bu&s;hes, and runs like a mou&s;e through the bottom of the thorns, e|vading the &s;ight.

<P>OF tho&s;e birds which con&s;titute this cla&s;s we only find two kinds which inhabit this i&s;land, and the&s;e are not the mo&s;t numerous of the various tribes with which this country abounds. The u&s;e|ful in&s;tincts and propen&s;ities of this little active race are chiefly confined to countries under the more immediate influence of the &s;un, where they are of infinite u&s;e in de&s;troying tho&s;e numerous &s;warms of noxious in&s;ects engendered by heat and moi&s;ture, which are continually upon the wing. The&s;e, though weak and contemptible when indi|vidually con&s;idered, are formidable by their num|bers, devouring the whole produce of vegetation, and carrying in their train the accumulated ills of pe&s;tilence and famine. Thus, to u&s;e the words of an eminent Naturali&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffon.</NOTE> "we &s;ee, that all nature is balanced, and the circle of generation and de&s;truc|tion is perpetual! The philo&s;opher contemplates with melancholy this &s;eemingly cruel &s;y&s;tem, and &s;trives in vain to reconcile it with his ideas of be|nevolence; but he is forcibly &s;truck with the nice adju&s;tment of the various parts, their mutual con|nection and &s;ubordination, and the unity of plan which pervades the whole."</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="226">The characters of this genus with us are &s;ome|what equivocal and not well a&s;certained, neither do we know of any common name in our lan|guage by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed. Mr Pennant de&s;cribes it thus: "Bill flatted at the ba&s;e, almo&s;t triangular, notched at the end of the upper mandi|ble, and be&s;et with bri&s;tles at its ba&s;e." We have placed the Flycatcher here, as introductory to the numerous cla&s;s which follows, to which they are nearly related, both in re&s;pect to form, habits, and modes of living: The affinity between them is &s;o great, as to occa&s;ion &s;ome confu&s;ion in the arrange|ment of &s;everal of the individuals of each kind, for which rea&s;on we have placed them together.</P>

This bird feeds on in&s;ects, which it catches on the wing; it &s;ome|times watches for its prey, &s;itting on a branch or po&s;t, and, with a &s;udden &s;pring, takes it as it flies, and immediately returns to its &s;tation to wait for more; it is likewi&s;e fond of cherries. Mr Lath|am &s;ays, it is known in Kent by the name of the Cherry-&s;ucker. It has no &s;ong, but only a &s;ort of inward wailing note, when it perceives any danger to it&s;elf or young: It breeds only once, and re|tires early. When its young are able to fly, it re|tires with them to the woods, where it &s;ports with them among the higher branches, &s;inking and ri&s;ing often perpendicularly among the flies which hum below.</P>

<P>THIS bird, &s;o de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed for the excel|lence of its &s;ong, is not remarkable for the variety or richne&s;s of its colours; it is &s;omewhat more than &s;ix inches in length: Its bill is brown, yel|low on the edges at the ba&s;e; eyes hazel; the whole upper part of the body is of a ru&s;ty brown, tinged with olive; the under parts pale a&s;h co|lour, almo&s;t white at the throat and vent; the quills are brown, with reddi&s;h margins; legs pale brown. The male and female are very &s;imilar.</P>
<P>Although the Nightingale is common in this country, it never vi&s;its the northern parts of our i&s;land, and is but &s;eldom &s;een in the we&s;tern coun|ties
<PB N="200" REF="232">
of Devon&s;hire and Cornwall: It leaves us &s;ome time in the month of Augu&s;t, and makes its regular return the beginning of April; it is &s;up|po&s;ed, during that interval, to vi&s;it the di&s;tant re|gions of A&s;ia; this is probable, as they do not win|ter in any part of France, Germany, Italy, Greece, &amp;c. neither does it appear that they &s;tay in Africa, but are &s;een at all times in India, Per&s;ia, China, and Japan; in the latter place they are much e|&s;teemed for their &s;ong, and &s;ell at great prices. They are &s;pread generally throughout Europe, e|ven as far north as Siberia and Sweden, where they are &s;aid to &s;ing delightfully; they, however, are partial to particular places, and avoid others which &s;eem as likely to afford them the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;upport. It is not improbable, however, that, by planting a colony in a well-cho&s;en &s;itua|tion, the&s;e delightful &s;ong&s;ters might be induced to haunt places where they are not at pre&s;ent &s;een; the experiment might be ea&s;ily tried, and, &s;hould it &s;ucceed, the reward would be great in the rich and varied &s;ong of this unrivalled bird. The fol|lowing animated de&s;cription of it is taken from the ingenious author of the <HI>Hi&s;toire des Oi&s;eaux:</HI>&mdash;
<Q>The leader of the vernal chorus begins with a low and timid voice, and he prepares for the hymn to nature by e&s;&s;aying his powers and at|tuning his organs; by degrees the &s;ound opens and &s;wells, it bur&s;ts with loud and vivid fla&s;hes, it flows with &s;mooth volubility, it faints and mur|murs,
<PB N="201" REF="233">
it &s;hakes with rapid and violent articula|tions; the &s;oft breathings of love and joy are poured from his inmo&s;t &s;oul, and every heart beats uni&s;on, and melts with delicious languor. But this continued richne&s;s might &s;atiate the ear. The &s;trains are at times relieved by pau&s;es, which be&s;tow dignity and elevation. The mild &s;ilence of evening heightens the general effect, and not a rival interrupts the &s;olemn &s;cene.</Q>&mdash; The&s;e birds begin to build about the end of April or the beginning of May; they make their ne&s;t in the lower part of a thick bu&s;h or hedge; the fe|male lays four or five eggs, of a greeni&s;h brown colour; the ne&s;t is compo&s;ed of dry gra&s;s and leaves, intermixed with &s;mall fibres, and lined with hair, down, and other &s;oft and warm &s;ub&s;tances. The bu&s;ine&s;s of incubation is entirely performed by the female, whil&s;t the cock, at no great di&s;tance, entertains her with his delightful melody; &s;o &s;oon, however, as the young are hatched, he leaves off &s;inging, and joins her in the care of providing for the young brood. The&s;e birds make a &s;econd hatch, and &s;ometimes a third; and in hot coun|tries they are &s;aid to have four.</P>
<P>The Nightingale is a &s;olitary bird, and never unites in flocks like many of the &s;maller birds, but hides it&s;elf in the thicke&s;t parts of the bu&s;hes, and &s;ings generally in the night: Its food con&s;i&s;ts prin|cipally of in&s;ects, &s;mall worms, eggs of ants, and &s;ometimes berries of various kinds. Nightingales,
<PB N="202" REF="234">
though timorous and &s;hy, are ea&s;ily caught; &s;nares of all &s;orts are laid for them, and generally &s;uc|ceed; they are likewi&s;e caught on lime twigs:&mdash; Young ones are &s;ometimes brought up from the ne&s;t, and fed with great care till they are able to &s;ing. It is with great difficulty that old birds are induced to &s;ing after being taken; for a con&s;ider|able time they refu&s;e to eat, but by great attention to their treatment, and avoiding every thing that might agitate them, they at length re&s;ume their &s;ong, and continue it during the greate&s;t part of the year.</P>

<P>THIS general favorite is too well known to need a very minute de&s;cription: Its bill is &s;lender and delicate; its eyes are large, black, and expre&s;|&s;ive, and its a&s;pect mild; its head and all the upper parts of its body are brown, tinged with a greeni&s;h

<P>During the &s;ummer the Redbrea&s;t is rarely to be &s;een; it retires to woods and thickets, where, with its mate, it prepares for the accommodation of its future family. Its ne&s;t is placed near the ground, by the roots of trees, in the mo&s;t conceal|ed &s;pot, and &s;ometimes in old buildings; it is con|&s;tructed of mo&s;s, intermixed with hair and dried leaves, and lined with feathers: In order more effectually to conceal it, the bird covers its ne&s;t with leaves, leaving only a narrow winding en|trance under the heap. The female lays from five to nine eggs, of a dull white, marked with reddi&s;h &s;pots. During the time of incubation, the cock &s;its at no great di&s;tance, and makes the woods re&s;ound with his delightful warble; he keenly cha&s;es all the birds of his own &s;pecies, and drives them from his little &s;ettlement; for, as faith|ful as they are amorous, it has never been ob&s;er|ved that two pairs of the&s;e birds were ever lodged in the &s;ame bu&s;h.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unum arbu&s;tum non alit duos erithacos.</NOTE> The Redbrea&s;t prefers the thick &s;hade, where there is water; it feeds on in|&s;ects and worms; its delicacy in preparing the lat|ter is &s;omewhat remarkable:&mdash;It takes it by one end, in its beak, and beats it on the ground till the

inward part comes away; then, taking it by the other in like manner, clean&s;es it from all its im|purities, eating only the outward part or &s;kin.&mdash; Although the Redbrea&s;t never quits this i&s;land, it performs a partial migration. As &s;oon as the bu|&s;ine&s;s of incubation is over, and the young are &s;uf|ficiently grown to provide for them&s;elves, it leaves its retirement, and again draws near the habitations of mankind: Its well-known familiarity has at|tracted the attention and &s;ecured the protection of men in all ages; it haunts the dwellings of the cot|tager, and partakes of his humble fare; when the cold grows &s;evere, and &s;now covers the ground, it approaches the hou&s;e, taps at the window with its bill, as if to entreat an a&s;ylum, which is always chearfully granted, and, with a &s;implicity the mo&s;t delightful, hops round the hou&s;e, picks up crumbs, and &s;eems to make him&s;elf one of the family.&mdash; Thom&s;on has very beautifully de&s;cribed the an|nual vi&s;its of this little gue&s;t in the following lines:

Buffon &s;ays, that as &s;oon as the young birds have attained their full plumage, they prepare for their departure; but in thus changing their &s;ituation, they do not gather in flocks, but per|form their journey &s;ingly, one after another; which is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of this bird.

<P>THE length of this well-known bird is &s;omewhat more than five inches: Its bill is dark; eyes ha|zel; its general appearance is that of a du&s;ky brown, mo&s;t of the feathers on the back and wings being edged with reddi&s;h brown; the cheeks, throat, and fore part of its neck are of a dull blue|i&s;h a&s;h colour; the belly is of a dirty white; quills and tail du&s;ky; rump greeni&s;h brown; &s;ides and thighs pale tawny brown; the legs are brown.</P>
<P>This bird is frequently &s;een in hedges, from whence it derives one of its names; but it has no
<PB N="214" REF="246">
other relation to the Sparrow than in the dingine&s;s of its colours; in every other re&s;pect it differs en|tirely. It remains with us the whole year, and builds its ne&s;t near the ground; it is compo&s;ed of mo&s;s and wool, and lined with hair; the female generally lays four or five eggs, of a uniform pale blue, without any &s;pots: The young are hatched about the beginning of May. During the time of &s;itting, if a cat or other voracious animal &s;hould happen to come near the ne&s;t, the mother endea|vours to divert it from the &s;pot by a &s;tratagem &s;i|milar to that by which the Partridge mi&s;leads the dog: She &s;prings up, flutters from &s;pot to &s;pot, and by that means allures her enemy to a &s;afe di&s;tance. In France, the Hedge-&s;parrow is rarely &s;een but in winter; it arrives generally in October, and de|parts in the &s;pring for more northern regions, where it breeds. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to brave the ri|gours of winter in Sweden, and that it a&s;&s;umes the white plumage common in tho&s;e &s;evere cli|mates in that &s;ea&s;on. Its &s;ong is little varied, but plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially in a &s;ea&s;on when all the other warblers are &s;ilent: Its u&s;ual &s;train is a &s;ort of qui|vering, frequently repeating &s;omething like the fol|lowing <HI>tit-tit-tititit,</HI> from whence, in &s;ome places, it is called the Titling. We have already ob&s;er|ved that the Cuckoo frequently makes u&s;e of the ne&s;t of this bird to depo&s;it her egg in.</P>

And our ingenious countryman, Mr White, ob&s;erves, that it has u&s;ually a full, &s;weet, deep, loud, and wild pipe, yet the &s;train is of &s;hort continuance, and its motions de&s;ultory; but when this bird &s;its calmly, and in earne&s;t engages in &s;ong, it pours forth very &s;weet but inward melody, and expre&s;&s;es great variety of &s;weet and gentle modu|lations, &s;uperior perhaps to any of our warblers, the Nightingale excepted; and, while they warble, their throats are wonderfully di&s;tended. Black-caps feed chiefly on flies and in&s;ects, and not un|frequently on ivy and other berries.</P>

<P>OF all the various families of birds, which re&s;ort to this i&s;land for food and &s;helter, there is none which has occa&s;ioned &s;o many conjectures re&s;pect|ing its appearance and departure as the Swallow tribe:&mdash;Of this we have already hazarded our opinion in the introductory part of our work, to which we refer our readers. The habits and modes of living of this tribe are perhaps more con|&s;picuous than tho&s;e of any other. From the time of their arrival to that of their departure they &s;eem continually before our eyes.&mdash;The Swallow lives habitually in the air, and performs its various functions in that element; and whether it pur&s;ues its fluttering prey, and follows the devious wind|ings of the in&s;ects on which it feeds, or endeavours to e&s;cape the birds of prey by the quickne&s;s of its motion, it de&s;cribes lines &s;o mutable, &s;o varied, &s;o interwoven, and &s;o confu&s;ed, that they hardly can be pictured by words.&mdash;"The Swallow tribe is of all others mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive, harmle&s;s, entertaining, and &s;ocial; all except one &s;pecies attach them|&s;elves to our hou&s;es, amu&s;e us with their migra|tions, &s;ongs, and marvellous agility, and clear the air of gnats and other trouble&s;ome in&s;ects, which would otherwi&s;e much annoy and incommode us.

country, will &s;oon be convinced to what a degree our atmo&s;phere would be choked with them, were it not for the friendly interpo&s;ition of the Swallow tribe."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">White's Selborne.</NOTE> Not many attempts have been made to pre&s;erve Swallows alive during the winter, and of the&s;e, few have &s;ucceeded. The following experi|ments, by Mr James Pear&s;on of London, commu|nicated to us by Sir John Trevelyan, Bart. are highly intere&s;ting, and throw great light upon the natural hi&s;tory of the Swallow; we &s;hall give them nearly in Mr Pear&s;on's own words.</P>
<P>"Five or &s;ix of the&s;e birds were taken about the latter end of Augu&s;t, 1784, in a bat fowling net at night; they were put &s;eparately into &s;mall cages, and fed with Nightingale's food: In about a week or ten days they took the food of them&s;elves; they were then put all together into a deep cage, four feet long, with gravel at the bottom; a broad &s;hallow pan with water was placed in it, in which they &s;ometimes wa&s;hed them&s;elves, and &s;eemed much &s;trengthened by it. One day Mr Pear&s;on ob&s;erved that they went into the water with un|u&s;ual eagerne&s;s, hurrying in and out again repeat|edly, with &s;uch &s;wiftne&s;s as if they had been &s;udden|ly &s;eized with a frenzy. Being anxious to &s;ee the re&s;ult, he left them to them&s;elves about half an hour, and on going to the cage again, &s;ound them all huddled together in a corner of the cage, appa|rently
<PB N="250" REF="282">
dead; the cage was then placed at a proper di&s;tance from the fire, when two of them only re|covered, and were as healthy as before&mdash;the re&s;t died; the two remaining ones were allowed to wa&s;h them&s;elves occa&s;ionally for a &s;hort time on|ly; but their feet &s;oon after became &s;welled and in|flamed, which Mr P. attributed to their perching, and they died about Chri&s;tmas: Thus the fir&s;t year's experiment was in &s;ome mea&s;ure lo&s;t. Not di&s;couraged by the failure of this, Mr P. determin|ed to make a &s;econd trial the &s;ucceeding year, from a &s;trong de&s;ire of being convinced of the truth re|&s;pecting their going into a &s;tate of torpidity. Ac|cordingly, the next &s;ea&s;on, having taken &s;ome more birds, he put them into the cage, and in every re|&s;pect pur&s;ued the &s;ame methods as with the la&s;t; but to guard their feet from the bad effects of the damp and cold, he covered the perches with flannel, and had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve that the birds throve extremely well, they &s;ung their &s;ong through the winter, and &s;oon after Chri&s;tmas began to moult, which they got through without any difficulty, and lived three or four years, regularly moulting every year at the u&s;ual time. On the renewal of their feathers it appeared that their tails were forked ex|actly the &s;ame as in tho&s;e birds which return here in the &s;pring, and in every re&s;pect their appearance was the &s;ame. The&s;e birds, &s;ays Mr Pear&s;on, were exhibited to the Society for promoting Natu|ral Hi&s;tory, on the 14th day of February, 1786, at
<PB N="251" REF="283">
the time they were in a deep moult, during a &s;e|vere fro&s;t, when the &s;now was on the ground. Mi|nutes of this circum&s;tance were entered in the books of the &s;ociety. The&s;e birds died at la&s;t from neglect during a long illne&s;s which Mr Pear|&s;on had;&mdash;they died in the &s;ummer. Mr P. con|cludes his very intere&s;ting account in the&s;e words: "Jan. 20, 1797.&mdash;I have now in my hou&s;e, No. 21, Great Newport-&s;treet. Long-Acre, four Swal|lows in moult, in as perfect health as any birds e|ver appeared to be in when moulting."</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e experiments pretty clearly proves, that Swallows do not in any material in|&s;tance differ from other birds in their nature and propen&s;ities; but that they leave us, like many o|ther birds, when this country can no longer furni&s;h them with a &s;upply of their proper and natural food, and that con&s;equently they &s;eek it in other places, where they meet with that &s;upport which enables them to throw off their feathers. Swallows are found in every country of the known world, but &s;eldom remain the whole year in the &s;ame cli|mate; the times of their appearance and departure in this country are well known; they are the con|&s;tant harbingers of &s;pring, and on their arrival all nature a&s;&s;umes a more chearful a&s;pect. The bill of this genus is &s;hort, very broad at the ba&s;e, and a little bent; the head is flat, and the neck &s;carcely vi&s;ible; the tongue is &s;hort, broad, and cloven; tail mo&s;tly forked; wings long; legs &s;hort.</P>

<P>The common Swallow makes its appearance with us &s;oon after the vernal equinox, and leaves us again about the end of September: It builds its ne&s;t generally in chimnies, in the in&s;ide, within a few feet of the top, or under the eaves of hou&s;es; it is curiou&s;ly con&s;tructed, of a cylindrical &s;hape, pla&s;tered with mud, mixed with &s;traw and hair, and lined with feathers; it is attached to the &s;ides or corners of the chimney, and is &s;ometimes a foot in height, open at the top; the female lays five or &s;ix eggs, white, &s;peckled with red. Swallows return to the &s;ame haunts; they build annually a new ne&s;t, and fix it, if the place admits, above that occupied the preceding year.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffon.</NOTE> We are favoured by Sir John Trevelyan, Bart. with the following curious fact:&mdash;At Camerton Hall, near Bath, a pair of Swallows built their ne&s;t on the upper part of the frame of an old picture over the chimney, coming through a broken pane in the window of the room. They came three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and in all pro|bability would have continued to do &s;o if the room had not been put into repair, which prevented their acce&s;s to it. Both this bird and the Martin have generally two broods in the year, the fir&s;t in June, the other in Augu&s;t, or perhaps later. We have &s;een a young Swallow, which was &s;hot on the 26th

The Night-jar is found in every part of the old continent, from Siberia to Greece, Africa, and India; it arrives in this coun|try about the latter end of May, being one of our late&s;t birds of pa&s;&s;age, and departs &s;ome time in the latter end of Augu&s;t or the beginning of Septem|ber; it is no where numerous, and never appears in flocks: Like the Owl, it is &s;eldom &s;een in the day-time, unle&s;s di&s;turbed, or in dark and gloomy days, when its eyes are not dazzled by the bright rays of the &s;un: It feeds on in&s;ects, which it catch|es on the wing; it is a great de&s;troyer of the cock-chafer or dor-beetle, from whence in &s;ome places it is called the Dor-hawk: Six of the&s;e in&s;ects have been found in its &s;tomach, be&s;ides four or five large-bodied moths.

foot is u&s;eful in taking its prey, as he ob&s;erved that it frequently put forth its leg whil&s;t on the wing, with which it &s;eemed to convey &s;omething to its mouth. The&s;e birds frequent moors and wild heathy tracts abounding with ferns; they make no ne&s;t, but the female depo&s;its her eggs on the ground; &s;he lays only two or three, which are of a dull white, &s;potted with brown. Birds of this kind are &s;een mo&s;t frequently towards autumn; their motions are irregular and rapid, &s;ometimes wheeling in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion round a tree or other object, diving at intervals as if to catch their prey, and then ri&s;ing again as &s;uddenly. When perched, the Night-jar &s;its u&s;ually on a bare twig, its head lower than its tail, and in this attitude utters its jarring note; it is likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;ort of buzzing which it makes while on the wing, which has been compared to the noi&s;e cau&s;ed by the quick rotation of a &s;pinning-wheel, from which, in &s;ome places, it is called the Wheel-bird; &s;ome|times it utters a &s;mall plaintive note or &s;queak, which it repeats four or five times in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the latter, probably, is its note of call by which it invites the female, and which it has been ob&s;erved to utter when in pur&s;uit of her. Buffon &s;ays, that it does not perch like other birds, &s;itting acro&s;s the branch, but lengthwi&s;e.

The manners of pigeons are well known, few &s;pe|cies being more univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed; and having a very powerful wing, they are enabled to perform very di&s;tant journies; accordingly wild and tame pigeons occur in every climate, and although they thrive be&s;t in warm countries, yet with care they &s;ucceed al&s;o in very northern latitudes: Every where their manners are gentle and lively; they are fond of &s;ociety, and the very emblem of con|nubial attachment; they are faithful to their mates, whom they &s;olicit with the &s;ofte&s;t cooings, the tendere&s;t care&s;&s;es, and the mo&s;t graceful move|ments.

The Pigeon u&s;ed on the&s;e occa|&s;ions was taken from the place to which the ad|vices were to be communicated, and the letters being tied under its wings, the bird was let loo&s;e, and in &s;pite of &s;urrounding armies and every ob|&s;tacle that would have effectually prevented any other means of conveyance, guided by in&s;tinct a|lone, it returned directly home, where the intelli|gence was &s;o much wanted.

from the &s;outhern parts of A&s;ia, and when young are extremely &s;en&s;ible of cold: They have a di&s;or|dered and unplea&s;ant appearance, but are in much e&s;teem for the table.</P>
<P>We &s;hall fini&s;h our li&s;t with the Engli&s;h Game-Cock, which &s;tands unrivalled by tho&s;e of any other nation for its invincible courage, and on that account is made u&s;e of as the in&s;trument of the cruel &s;port of cock-fighting. To trace this cu&s;tom to its origin we mu&s;t look back into barbarous times, and lament that it &s;till continues the di&s;|grace of an enlightened and philo&s;ophic age. The Athenians allotted one day in the year to cock-fighting; the Romans are &s;aid to have learned it from them; and by that warlike people it was fir&s;t introduced into this i&s;land. Henry VIII. was &s;o attached to the &s;port, that he cau&s;ed a commodious hou&s;e to be erected for that purpo&s;e, which, though it is now applied to a very different u&s;e, &s;till re|tains the name of the Cock-pit. The Chine&s;e and many of the nations of India are &s;o extravagantly fond of this unmanly &s;port, that, during the par|oxy&s;ms of their phrenzy, they will &s;ometimes ri&s;k not only the whole of their property, but their wives and children on the i&s;&s;ue of a battle.</P>
<P>The appearance of the Game-cock, when in his full plumage, and not mutilated for the purpo&s;e of fighting, is &s;trikingly beautiful and animated: His head, which is &s;mall, is adorned with a beautiful red comb and wattles; his eyes &s;parkle with fire,
<PB N="279" REF="311">
and his whole demeanour be&s;peaks boldne&s;s and freedom; the feathers on his neck are long, and fall gracefully down upon his body, which is thick, firm, and compact; his tail is long, and forms a beautiful arch behind, which gives a grace to all his motions; his legs are &s;trong, and are armed with &s;harp &s;purs, with which he defends him&s;elf and at|tacks his adver&s;ary. When &s;urrounded by his fe|males, his whole a&s;pect is full of animation; he al|lows of no competitor, but on the approach of a rival he ru&s;hes forward to in&s;tant combat, and either drives him from the field, or peri&s;hes in the attempt. The Cock is very attentive to his fe|males, hardly ever lo&s;ing &s;ight of them; he leads, defends, and cheri&s;hes them, collects them toge|ther when they &s;traggle, and &s;eems to eat unwil|lingly till he &s;ees them feeding around him; when he lo&s;es them he utters his griefs, and from the different inflexions of his voice, and the various &s;ignificant ge&s;tures which he makes, one would be led to conclude that it is a &s;pecies of language which &s;erves to communicate his &s;entiments. The fecundity of the hen is great; &s;he lays generally two eggs in three days, and continues to lay through the greate&s;t part of the year, except during the time of moulting, which la&s;ts about two months. After having laid about twenty-five or thirty eggs, &s;he prepares for the painful talk of incubation, and gives the mo&s;t certain indications of her wants by
<PB N="280" REF="312">
her cries and the violence of her emotions. If &s;he &s;hould be deprived of her own eggs, which is fre|quently the ca&s;e, &s;he will cover tho&s;e of any other kind, or even fictitious ones of &s;tone or chalk, by which means &s;he wa&s;tes her&s;elf in fruitle&s;s efforts. A &s;itting hen is a lively emblem of the mo&s;t af|fectionate &s;olicitude and attention; &s;he covers her eggs with her wings, fo&s;ters them with a genial warmth, changing them gently, that all parts may be properly heated; &s;he &s;eems to perceive the im|portance of her employment, and is &s;o intent in her occupation, that &s;he neglects, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of food and drink; &s;he omits no care, overlooks no precaution, to complete the ex|i&s;tence of the little incipient beings, and to guard again&s;t the dangers that threaten them. Buffon, with his u&s;ual elegance, ob&s;erves, "that the con|dition of a &s;itting hen, however in&s;ipid it may ap|pear to us, is perhaps not a tedious &s;ituation, but a &s;tate of continual joy; &s;o much has Nature con|nected raptures with whatever relates to the mul|tiplication of her creatures!"</P>
<P>For a curious account of the progre&s;s of incuba|tion, in the developement of the chick, we refer our readers to the above-mentioned author, who has given a minute detail of the &s;everal appearan|ces which take place, at different &s;tated periods, till the young chick is ready to break the &s;hell and come forth. In former times the Egyptians, and in later days philo&s;ophers, have &s;ucceeded in hatch|ing
<PB N="281" REF="313">
eggs without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the hen, and that in great numbers at once, by means of artificial heat, corre&s;ponding with the warmth of the hen: The eggs are placed in ovens, to which an equal and moderate degree of heat is applied, and every kind of moi&s;ture or pernicious exhalation careful|ly avoided&mdash;by which means, and by turning the eggs &s;o that every part may enjoy alike the requi|&s;ite heat, hundreds may be produced at the &s;ame time.</P>

<P>IS of the &s;ize of the common Cock: The bill is of a pale horn colour; the no&s;trils are hid under an arched covering; the eyes are yellow, and are &s;ur|rounded by a naked warty &s;kin, of a beautiful &s;car|let, finely &s;potted with black; immediately under each eye there is a &s;mall patch of &s;hort feathers,
<PB N="283" REF="315">
of a dark glo&s;&s;y purple; the upper parts of the head and neck are of a deep purple, varying to glo&s;&s;y green and blue; the lower parts of the neck and brea&s;t are of a reddi&s;h che&s;tnut, with black indented edges; the &s;ides and lower part of the brea&s;t are of the &s;ame colour, with pretty large tips of black to each feather, which in different lights vary to a glo&s;&s;y purple; the belly and vent are du&s;ky; the back and &s;capulars are beautifully variegated with black and white, or cream colour &s;peckled with black, and mixed with deep orange, all the feathers being edged with black; on the lower part of the back there is a mixture of green; the quills are du&s;ky, freckled with white; wing co|verts brown, glo&s;&s;ed with green, and edged with white; rump plain reddi&s;h brown; the two middle feathers of the tail are about twenty inches long, the &s;horte&s;t on each &s;ide le&s;s than five, of a red|di&s;h brown colour, marked with tran&s;ver&s;e bars of black; the legs are du&s;ky, with a &s;hort blunt &s;pur on each; between the toes there is a &s;trong mem|brane.</P>
<P>The female is le&s;s, and does not exhibit that va|riety and brilliancy of colours which di&s;tingui&s;h the male: The general colours are light and dark brown, mixed with black; the brea&s;t and belly finely freckled with &s;mall black &s;pots on a light ground; the tail is &s;hort, and barred &s;omewhat like the male; the &s;pace round the eye is covered with feathers.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="316">The Ring Phea&s;ant is a fine variety of this breed; its only difference con&s;i&s;ts in a white ring, which encircles the lower part of the neck; the colours of the plumage in general are likewi&s;e more di&s;tinct and vivid. A fine &s;pecimen of this bird was &s;ent us by the Rev. Wm Turner, of Newca&s;|tle, from which our figure was engraven. They are &s;ometimes met with in the neighbourhood of Alnwick, whither they were brought by his Grace the Duke of Northumberland. That they inter|mix with the common breed is very obvious, as in tho&s;e we have &s;een the ring has been more or le&s;s di&s;tinct; in &s;ome hardly vi&s;ible, and in others a few feathers only, marked with white, appear on each &s;ide of the neck, forming a white &s;pot. It is much to be regretted that this beautiful breed is likely &s;oon to be de&s;troyed by tho&s;e who pur&s;ue every &s;pecies of game with an avaricious and indi&s;crimi|nating rapacity.</P>
<P>There are great varieties of Phea&s;ants, of extra|ordinary beauty and brilliancy of colours; many of the&s;e, brought from the rich provinces of China, are kept in aviaries in this kingdom; the Common Phea&s;ant is likewi&s;e a native of the ea&s;t, and is the only one of its kind that has multiplied in our i&s;land. Phea&s;ants are generally found in low woody places, on the borders of plains, where they delight to &s;port; during the night they perch on the branches of trees: They are very &s;hy birds, and do not a&s;&s;ociate together, except during the months

The hen breeds on the ground like the Partridge, and lays from twelve to fifteen eggs, which are &s;maller than tho&s;e of the Common Hen; the young follow the mother as &s;oon as ever they are freed from the &s;hell.

<P>IT &s;eems to be generally allowed that this bird was originally brought from America, and in its wild &s;tate is con&s;iderably larger than our dome&s;tic Turkies: Its general colour is black, variegated with bronze and bright glo&s;&s;y green, in &s;ome parts changing to purple; the quills are green gold, black towards the ends, and tipped with white; the tail con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen feathers, of a brown co|lour, mottled and tipped with black; the tail co|verts are waved with black and white; on the
<PB N="287" REF="319">
brea&s;t there is a tuft of black hairs, eight inches in length: In other re&s;pects it re&s;embles the dome&s;tic Turkey, in having a bare red carunculated head and neck, a fle&s;hy dilatable appendage hanging over the bill, and a &s;hort blunt &s;pur or knob at the back part of the leg.</P>
<P>Tame Turkies, like every other animal in a &s;tate of dome&s;tication, are of various colours; of the&s;e the prevailing one is dark grey, inclining to black, with a little white towards the ends of the feathers: &s;ome are perfectly white; others black and white; there is al&s;o a beautiful variety of a fine deep copper colour, with the greater quills pure white; the tail of a dirty white: In all of them the tuft of black hair on the brea&s;t is prevalent. Tur|kies are bred in great numbers in Norfolk, Suffolk, and other counties, from whence they are driven to the London markets in flocks of &s;everal hundreds each. The drivers manage them with great faci|lity, by means of a bit of red rag tied to a long pole, which, from the antipathy the&s;e birds bear to that colour, acts as a &s;courge, and effectually an|&s;wers the purpo&s;e. The motions of the Turkey, when agitated with de&s;ire or inflamed with rage, are very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Peacock; it erects its train, and &s;preads it like a fan, whil&s;t its wings droop and trail on the ground, uttering at the &s;ame time a dull hollow &s;ound; it &s;truts round and round with &s;olemn pace, a&s;&s;umes all the dignity of the mo&s;t maje&s;tic of birds, and thus expre&s;&s;es its attach|ment

to its females, or its re&s;entment to tho&s;e ob|jects which have excited its indignation. The Hen Turkey begins to lay early in the &s;pring; &s;he is very attentive to the bu&s;ine&s;s of incubation, and will produce fifteen or &s;ixteen chicks at one time, but &s;eldom has more than one hatch in a &s;ea&s;on in this climate. Young Turkies, after their extrication from the &s;hell, are very tender, and require great attention in rearing them; they are &s;ubject to a variety of di&s;ea&s;es from cold, rain, and dews; even the &s;un it&s;elf, when they are expo&s;ed to its more powerful rays, is &s;aid to occa&s;ion almo&s;t immediate death. As &s;oon as they are &s;ufficiently &s;trong, they are abandoned by the mother, and are then capable of enduring the utmo&s;t rigour of our win|ters.</P>

Its head is adorned with a tuft, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-four feathers, who&s;e &s;lender &s;hafts are furni&s;hed with webs only at the ends, painted with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite green, mixed with gold; the head, throat, neck, and brea&s;t, are of a deep blue, glo&s;&s;ed with green and gold; the back the &s;ame, tinged with bronze; the &s;capulars and le&s;&s;er wing coverts are of a reddi&s;h cream co|lour, variegated with black; the middle coverts deep blue, glo&s;&s;ed with green and gold; the great|er coverts and ba&s;tard wing are of a reddi&s;h brown, as are al&s;o the quills, &s;ome of which are variegated with black and green; the belly and vent are black, with a greeni&s;h hue: But the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racter of this &s;ingular bird is its train, which ri&s;es ju&s;t above the tail, and, when erected, forms a fan of the mo&s;t re&s;plendent hues; the two middle fea|thers are &s;ometimes four feet and a half long, the others gradually dimini&s;hing on each &s;ide; the &s;hafts, which are white, are furni&s;hed from their origin nearly to the end with parted filaments of varying colours, ending in a flat vane, which is decorated with what is called <HI>the eye.</HI> "This is a brilliant &s;pot, enamelled with the mo&s;t enchant|ing colours; yellow, gilded with various &s;hades;

green, running into blue and bright violet, vary|ing according to its different po&s;itions; the whole receiving additional lu&s;tre from the colour of the centre, which is a fine velvet black." When plea&s;ed or delighted, and in &s;ight of his females, the Peacock erects his tail, and di&s;plays all the maje&s;ty of its beauty; all his movements are full of dignity; his head and neck bend nobly back; his pace is &s;low and &s;olemn, and he frequently turns &s;lowly and gracefully round, as if to catch the &s;un-beams in every direction, and produce new colours of inconceiveable richne&s;s and beauty, ac|companied at the &s;ame time with a hollow mur|muring voice expre&s;&s;ive of de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Peahen is &s;omewhat le&s;s than the cock, and though furni&s;hed both with a train and cre&s;t, they are de&s;titute of tho&s;e dazzling beauties which di&s;|tingui&s;h the male: She lays five or &s;ix eggs, of a whiti&s;h colour: For this purpo&s;e &s;he chu&s;es &s;ome &s;ecret &s;pot, where &s;he can conceal them from the male, who is apt to break them; &s;he &s;its from twenty-five to thirty days, according to the tem|perature of the climate, and the warmth of the &s;ea|&s;on. Peacocks have been originally brought from the di&s;tant provinces of India, and from thence have been diffu&s;ed over every part of the world. &mdash;The fir&s;t notice that has been taken of them is to be found in holy writ,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d Chron. ix. 21.</NOTE> where we are told,
<PB N="292" REF="324">
they made part of the cargoes of the rich and va|luable fleet which every three years imported the trea&s;ures of the Ea&s;t to Solomon's court. They are &s;ometimes found in a wild &s;tate in many parts of A&s;ia and Africa: The large&s;t and fine&s;t are &s;aid to be met with in the neighbourhood of the Ganges, and on the fertile plains of India, where they grow to a great &s;ize; under the influ|ence of that luxuriant climate this beautiful bird exhibits its dazzling colours, which &s;eem to vie with the gems and precious &s;tones produced in tho&s;e delightful regions. In colder climates they require great care in rearing, and do not obtain their full plumage till the third year.

<P>White Peacocks are not uncommon in England, the eyes of the train not excepted, which are bare|ly vi&s;ible, and may be traced by a different undu|lation of &s;hade upon the pure white of the tail. It is a very &s;ingular circum&s;tance, that the females of this &s;pecies have been &s;ometimes known to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of the male, by a total change of colour.

<P>This &s;pecies, which is now very common in this country, was originally brought from Africa, from whence it has been diffu&s;ed over every part of Eu|rope, the We&s;t Indies, and America: It formed a part of the Roman banquets, and is now much e&s;teemed as a delicacy, e&s;pecially the young birds.

The Pintado is a re&s;tle&s;s and very clamorous bird; it has a har&s;h, creaking note, which is very grating and unplea&s;ant; it &s;crapes the ground like the Hen, and rolls in the du&s;t to free it&s;elf from in&s;ects; during the night it perches on high places; if di&s;turbed, it alarms every thing within hearing by its uncea&s;ing cry.

<P>This bird is found in great plenty in the wild, heathy, and mountainous tracts in the northern counties of England; it is likewi&s;e common in Wales, and in the highlands of Scotland. Mr Pennant &s;uppo&s;es it to be peculiar to Britain; tho&s;e found in the mountainous parts of France, Spain, Italy, and el&s;ewhere, as mentioned by M. Buffon, are probably varieties of this kind, and we have no doubt would breed with it. We could wi&s;h that attempts were more frequently made to introduce a greater variety of the&s;e u&s;eful birds in|to this country, to &s;tock our wa&s;te and barren moors with a rich fund of delicate and whole&s;ome food; but, till a wi&s;e and enlightened legi&s;lature &s;hall alter or abrogate our very unequal and inju|dicious game laws, there hardly remains a &s;ingle hope for the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e we have. Red Grou&s;e pair in the &s;pring; the female lays eight or ten eggs, on the ground: The young ones follow the hen the whole &s;ummer; as &s;oon as they have attained their full &s;ize, they unite in flocks of forty or fifty, and are then exceedingly &s;hy and wild.</P>

This is its &s;ummer dre&s;s; in winter it changes to a pure white, except that in the male there is a black line between the bill and the eye; the tail con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen feathers; the two middle ones are a&s;h-coloured in &s;ummer, and

white in winter, the two next &s;lightly marked with white near the ends, the re&s;t are wholly black; the upper tail coverts are long, and almo&s;t cover the tail.</P>
<P>The White Grou&s;e is fond of lofty &s;ituations, where it braves the &s;evere&s;t cold: It is found in mo&s;t of the northern parts of Europe, even as far as Greenland; in this country it is only to be met with on the &s;ummits of &s;ome of our highe&s;t hills, chiefly in the highlands of Scotland, in the Heb|rides and Orkneys, and &s;ometimes, but rarely, on the lofty hills of Cumberland and Wales. Buffon, &s;peaking of this bird, &s;ays, that it avoids the &s;olar heat, and prefers the biting fro&s;ts on the tops of mountains; for, as the &s;now melts on the &s;ides of the mountains, it con&s;tantly a&s;cends, till it gains the &s;ummit, where it forms holes, and burrows in the &s;now. They pair at the &s;ame time with the Grou&s;e; the female lays eight or ten eggs, which are white, &s;potted with brown; &s;he makes no ne&s;t, but depo&s;its them on the ground. In winter they fly in flocks, and are &s;o little accu&s;tomed to the &s;ight of man, that they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be ea|&s;ily taken either with the &s;nare or gun. They feed on the wild productions of the hills, which &s;ome|times give the fle&s;h a bitter ta&s;te, but not unpalate|able; it is dark coloured, and according to M.

<P>Partridges are chiefly found in temperate cli|mates, the extremes of heat and cold being equally unfavourable to them: They are no where in greater plenty than in this i&s;land, where, in their &s;ea&s;on, they contribute to our mo&s;t elegant enter|tainments. It is much to be lamented, however, that the means taken to pre&s;erve this valuable bird &s;hould, in a variety of in&s;tances, prove its de&s;truc|tion; the proper guardians of the young ones and eggs, tied down by ungenerous re&s;trictions, are led to con&s;ider them as a growing evil, and not only connive at their de&s;truction, but too frequently a&s;|&s;i&s;t in it. Partridges pair early in the &s;pring; the female lays from fourteen to eighteen or twenty eggs, making her ne&s;t of dry leaves and gra&s;s upon the ground: The young birds learn to run as &s;oon as hatched, frequently encumbered with part of the &s;hell &s;ticking to them. It is no uncommon thing to introduce Partridge eggs under the common Hen, who hatches and rears them as her own: In this ca&s;e the young birds require to be fed with ants' eggs, which is their favourite food, and with|out which it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to bring them up; they likewi&s;e eat in&s;ects, and, when full grown, feed on all kinds of grain and young plants. The af|fection of the Partridge for her young is peculiarly &s;trong and lively; &s;he is greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the care of rearing them by her mate; they lead them out

<P>Quails are almo&s;t univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed through|out Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa; they are birds of pa&s;&s;age, and are &s;een in immen&s;e flocks traver&s;ing the Mediterranean &s;ea from Italy to the &s;hores of Africa in the autumn, and returning again in the &s;pring, frequently alighting in their pa&s;&s;age on ma|ny of the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, which they almo&s;t cover with their numbers. On the we&s;|tern coa&s;ts of the kingdom of Naples &s;uch prodi|gious quantities have appeared, that an hundred thou&s;and have been taken in a day within the &s;pace of four or five miles. From the&s;e circum|&s;tances it appears highly probable, that the Quails which &s;upplied the I&s;raelites with food, during their journey through the wilderne&s;s, were &s;ent thither on their pa&s;&s;age to the north by a wind from the &s;outh-we&s;t, &s;weeping over Egypt and Ethiopia to|wards the &s;hores of the Red &s;ea. Quails are not very numerous in this i&s;land; they breed with us, and many of them remain throughout the year, changing their quarters from the interior counties to the &s;ea coa&s;t. The female makes her ne&s;t like the Partridge, and lays to the number of &s;ix or

At this time the Chine&s;e are much addicted to the amu&s;ement of fighting Quails, and in &s;ome parts of Italy it is &s;aid likewi&s;e to be no unu&s;ual practice. After feeding two Quails very highly, they place them oppo&s;ite to each other, and throw in a few grains of &s;eed between them&mdash;the birds ru&s;h upon each other with the utmo&s;t fury, &s;triking with their bills and &s;purs till one of them yields.</P>

middle of each feather there is a dark &s;treak; the fore part of the neck and brea&s;t are nearly the &s;ame, but much paler; the belly, thighs, and vent are of a pale yellowi&s;h white; the quills are black; the tail is &s;hort and rounded&mdash;a dark band cro&s;&s;es the middle of each feather, the tips are black, the re&s;t white; the legs are yellow, and naked above the knees, which are very thick, as if &s;welled&mdash; hence its name; the claws are black.</P>
<P>This bird is found in great plenty in Norfolk and &s;everal of the &s;outhern counties, but is no where to be met with in the northern parts of our i&s;land; it prefers dry and &s;tony places, on the &s;ides of &s;loping banks: It makes no ne&s;t; the female lays two or three eggs on the bare ground, &s;helter|ed by a &s;tone, or in a &s;mall hole formed in the &s;and; they are of a dirty white, marked with &s;pots of a deep reddi&s;h colour, mixed with &s;light &s;treaks. Although this bird has great power of wing, and flies with great &s;trength, it is &s;eldom &s;een during the day, except &s;urpri&s;ed, when it &s;prings to &s;ome di&s;tance, and generally e&s;capes before the &s;port&s;|man comes within gun-&s;hot; it likewi&s;e runs on the ground almo&s;t as &s;wift as a dog; after running &s;ome time it &s;tops &s;hort, holding its head and body &s;till, and on the lea&s;t noi&s;e &s;quats clo&s;e on the ground. In the evening it comes out in que&s;t of food, and may then be heard at a great di&s;tance; its cry is &s;ingular, re&s;embling a hoar&s;e kind of whi&s;tle three or four times repeated, and has been
<PB N="323" REF="355">
compared to the turning of a ru&s;ty handle. Buf|fon endeavours to expre&s;s it by the words <HI>turrlui, turrlui,</HI> and &s;ays, it re&s;embles the &s;ound of a third flute, dwelling on three or four tones from a flat to a &s;harp. Its food con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of worms. It is &s;aid to be good eating when young; the fle&s;h of the old ones is hard, black, and dry. Mr White mentions them as frequenting the di&s;trict of Sel|borne, in Hamp&s;hire. He &s;ays, that the young run immediately from the ne&s;t, almo&s;t as &s;oon as they are excluded, like Partridges; that the dam leads them to &s;ome &s;tony field, where they ba&s;k, &s;kulking among the &s;tones, which they re&s;emble &s;o nearly in colour, as not ea&s;ily to be di&s;covered. Birds of this kind are migratory; they arrive in April, live with us all the &s;pring and &s;ummer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by getting together in flocks; it is &s;uppo&s;ed that they retire to Spain, and frequent the &s;heep-walks with which that country abounds.</P>

<P>THIS bird is about the &s;ize of a Pigeon: Its bill is black; eyes large and hazel; the top of the head is black, glo&s;&s;ed with green; a tuft of long narrow feathers i&s;&s;ues from the back part of the head, &s;ome of which are four inches in length, and turn upwards at the end; the &s;ides of the head and neck are white, which is interrupted by a blacki&s;h &s;treak above and below the eye; the back part of the neck is of a very pale brown; the fore part, as far as the brea&s;t, is black; the back and wing coverts
<PB N="325" REF="357">
are of a dark green, glo&s;&s;ed with purple and blue reflections; the quills are black, the four fir&s;t tip|ped with white; the brea&s;t and belly are of a pure white; the upper tail coverts and vent pale che&s;tnut; the tail is white at the ba&s;e, the end is black, with pale tips, the outer feathers almo&s;t wholly white; the legs are red; claws black; hind claw very &s;hort.</P>
<P>This bird is a con&s;tant inhabitant of this coun|try; but as it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly on worms, it is forced to change its place in que&s;t of food, and is fre|quently &s;een in great numbers by the &s;ea-&s;hores, where it finds an abundant &s;upply. It is every where well known by its loud and ince&s;&s;ant cries, which it repeats without intermi&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t on the wing, and from whence, in mo&s;t languages, a name has been given to it as imitative of the &s;ound.&mdash; The Pee-wit is a lively active bird, almo&s;t con|tinually in motion; it &s;ports and frolics in the air in all directions, and a&s;&s;umes a variety of atti|tudes; it remains long upon the wing, and &s;ome|times ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable height; it runs along the ground very nimbly, and &s;prings and bounds from &s;pot to &s;pot with great agility: The female lays four eggs, of a dirty olive, &s;potted with black; &s;he makes no ne&s;t, but depo&s;its them upon a little dry gra&s;s ha&s;tily &s;craped together; the young birds run very &s;oon after they are hatched;&mdash;during this period the old ones are very a&s;&s;iduous in their at|tention
<PB N="326" REF="358">
to their charge; on the approach of any per&s;on to the place of their depo&s;it, they flutter round his head with cries of the greate&s;t inquietude, which increa&s;es as he draws nearer the &s;pot where the brood are &s;quatted; in ca&s;e of extremity, and as a la&s;t re&s;ource, they run along the ground as if lame, in order to draw off the attention of the fow|ler from any further pur&s;uit. The young Lap|wings are fir&s;t covered with a blacki&s;h down in|ter&s;per&s;ed with long white hairs, which they gra|dually lo&s;e, and about the latter end of July they acquire their beautiful plumage. At this time, according to Buffon, the great a&s;&s;ociation begins to take place, and they a&s;&s;emble in large flocks of young and old, which hover in the air, &s;aunter in the meadows, and after rain they di&s;per&s;e among the ploughed fields. In the month of October the Lapwings are very fat, and are then &s;aid to be ex|cellent eating: Their eggs are con&s;idered as a great delicacy, and are &s;old in the London markets at three &s;hillings a dozen.</P>
<P>The following anecdote, communicated to us by the Rev. J. Carlyle, is worthy of notice, as it &s;hews the dome&s;tic nature of this bird, as well as the art with which it conciliates the regard of a|nimals differing from it&s;elf in nature, and general|ly con&s;idered as ho&s;tile to every &s;pecies of the fea|thered tribes. Two of the&s;e birds, given to Mr Carlyle, were put into a garden, where one of them &s;oon died; the other continued to pick up
<PB N="327" REF="359">
&s;uch food as the place afforded, till winter deprived it of its u&s;ual &s;upply; nece&s;&s;ity &s;oon compelled it to draw nearer the hou&s;e, by which it gradually be|came familiari&s;ed to occa&s;ional interruptions from the family. At length, one of the &s;ervants, when &s;he had occa&s;ion to go into the back-kitchen with a light, ob&s;erved that the Lapwing always uttered his cry '<HI>pee-wit</HI>' to obtain admittance. He &s;oon grew more familiar; as the winter advanced, he approached as far as the kitchen, but with much caution, as that part of the hou&s;e was generally oc|cupied by a dog and a cat, who&s;e friend&s;hip the Lap|wing at length conciliated &s;o entirely, that it was his regular cu&s;tom to re&s;ort to the fire&s;ide as &s;oon as it grew dark, and &s;pend the evening and night with his two a&s;&s;ociates, &s;itting clo&s;e by them, and partaking of the comforts of a warm fire&s;ide. As &s;oon as &s;pring appeared, he left off coming to the hou&s;e, and betook him&s;elf to the garden; but on the approach of winter, he had recour&s;e to his old &s;hel|ter and his old friends, who received him very cor|dially. Security was productive of in&s;olence; what was at fir&s;t obtained with caution, was after|wards taken without re&s;erve: He frequently amu|&s;ed him&s;elf with wa&s;hing in the bowl which was &s;et for the dog to drink out of, and while he was thus employed, he &s;hewed marks of the greate&s;t indignation if either of his companions pre&s;umed to interrupt him. He died in the a&s;ylum he had
<PB N="328" REF="360">
cho&s;en, being choaked with &s;omething which he picked up from the floor. During his confinement, crumbs of wheaten bread were his principal food, which he preferred to any thing el&s;e.</P>

<P><PB N="330" REF="362">The Golden Plover is common in this coun|try, and all the northern parts of Europe; it is very numerous in various parts of America, from Hud&s;on's Bay as far as Carolina, migrating from one place to another according to the &s;ea|&s;ons: It breeds on high and heathy mountains; the female lays four eggs, of a pale olive colour, variegated with blacki&s;h &s;pots: They fly in &s;mall flocks, and make a &s;hrill whi&s;tling noi&s;e, by an imi|tation of which they are &s;ometimes enticed within gun-&s;hot. The male and female do not differ from each other. In young birds the yellow &s;pots are not very di&s;tingui&s;hable, the plumage inclining more to gray.</P>

<P>We have placed this bird with the Plovers, as agreeing with them in every other re&s;pect but that of having a hind toe; but that is &s;o &s;mall as not to render it nece&s;&s;ary to exclude it from a place in the Plover family, to which it evidently belongs.

<P>The Dotterel is common in various parts of Great Britain; in others it is &s;carcely known:&mdash; They are &s;uppo&s;ed to breed in the mountains of Cumberland and We&s;tmorland, where they are &s;ometimes &s;een in the month of May, during the breeding &s;ea&s;on; they likewi&s;e breed on &s;everal of the Highland hills: They are very common in Cambridge&s;hire, Lincoln&s;hire, and Derby&s;hire, ap|pearing in &s;mall flocks on the heaths and moors of tho&s;e counties during the months of May and June, and are then very fat, and much e&s;teemed for the table.
