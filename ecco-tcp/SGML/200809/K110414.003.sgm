<P>I COULD not contrive to meet with Mr. Howard till dinner was announced, at which he &s;eemed ab&s;ent and ab&s;orbed; but as I then &s;at next him, I a&s;ked him to allow me to talk with him when we left the table.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;t the reque&s;t I was going to make, &s;aid he: and when the ladies re|tired to tea and coffee, under pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s he made his excu&s;es to the gen|tlemen and joined me in Mrs. Hindon's dre&s;&s;ing room.</P>
<P>No time is to be lo&s;t, dear Sir, &s;aid I to him the moment he entered, in chang|ing
<PB N="2" REF="3">
our abode. The &s;ooner the alteration in our circum&s;tances takes place, the &s;ooner &s;hall we be enabled to conquer that reluctance which it mu&s;t at fir&s;t occa&s;ion. We have been unwillingly con&s;trained, from a cruel peculiarity in our fate, to prove a burthen on the humanity of our friends too long. I will not wound your delicacy by touching on the un&s;peakable obligations under which you have laid us, and for which &s;imple gratitude is I fear all the return that will ever be allow|ed us to te&s;tify; that however you may be a&s;&s;ured is warm from our hearts, and never can be effaced from our remem|brance: but your &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Hindon, we have incommoded greatly too long. I have been con&s;idering many different plans, continued I; but as a &s;trict eco|nomy mu&s;t be the ba&s;is of all our &s;chemes, and that is in fact an art I have yet to learn, it is not ea&s;y to fix; neither, from my &s;hort re&s;idence in this country, am I
<PB N="3" REF="4">
an adequate judge of the &s;afety or pro|priety of any &s;tep, without a&s;king the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that friend whom Fate has left us. Do you imagine how|ever, without being too lavi&s;h of your trouble, that a reputable family might be found who would con&s;ent immediately to receive us for a moderate &s;um, till that mode of life can be clearly a&s;certained of which our finances will hereafter allow.</P>
<P>Perhaps there might, &s;aid he. But &s;urely Mi&s;s Seymour you do not think of removing immediately.</P>
<P>You do not &s;eem to approve of this &s;cheme, cried I, finding he &s;aid nothing more and &s;eemed buried in thought. Is there any other you would advi&s;e?</P>
<P>Ah, Mi&s;s Seymour! cried he at la&s;t; there is a &s;cheme&mdash;but I tremble to men|tion it.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words his face was over&s;pread with a confu&s;ion which covered mine with blu&s;hes. The &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of his
<PB N="4" REF="5">
manner, the embarra&s;&s;ment that had &s;eized him, and an unu&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion of &s;oftne&s;s in his countenance, altogether infu&s;ed &s;u&s;picions into my mind of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing nature: but Mr. Howard in&s;tantly recovered his dignity, and tak|ing my hand with a benevolent &s;mile, as if he had really penetrated into my thoughts and read my apprehen&s;ions.&mdash;Be not alarmed, &s;aid he; pre&s;umptuous my &s;ecret wi&s;hes perhaps once were, but I have been long &s;en&s;ible of their utter impropriety; and the conviction that they never could be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s has long &s;ince nipped them in the bud. It is indeed a plan on which the whole hap|pine&s;s of my future life depends, but of which I now confe&s;s to you your lovely &s;i&s;ter is the object.</P>
<P>Situated as I was, continued he, (for I knew not what reply to make) an in|mate for months in your family, under the title of your father's friend, I enjoyed
<PB N="5" REF="6">
a dangerous intimacy to which no other man had acce&s;s. The &s;nare, even at forty three, was not to be avoided; for where the mind and form both equally con&s;pire to charm and &s;educe, no age is exempted from feeling their united force. Again&s;t &s;uch there is no defence, and one only cure; for where hope is completely extingui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ion &s;eldom continues to torment. In this ca&s;e it often changes both its nature and its name, and melio|rating into a tender friend&s;hip, con&s;ti|tutes a le&s;s &s;elfi&s;h gratification in&s;tead of proving the mi&s;ery of our lives.</P>
<P>This, Mi&s;s Seymour, has been exactly my ca&s;e. My efforts however to e&s;cape from one danger have led me into ano|ther no le&s;s in&s;inuating. Tho' I intreat you to believe me, when I &s;olemnly de|clare that I never was for one moment either &s;o mad or &s;o intere&s;ted as to wi&s;h for my own enjoyment at the price of your amiable &s;i&s;ter's pro&s;perity; nor
<PB N="6" REF="7">
while her future pro&s;pects &s;eemed favor|able, and her &s;ituation in life promi&s;ed to prove almo&s;t equal to her merits, &s;hould any con&s;ideration on earth have induced me to make known my pre&s;ent pre&s;ump|tion. I &s;hould have had then no re|maining wi&s;h but for her happine&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s in every pur&s;uit. The di&s;ap|pointment of my wi&s;hes as to the latter, has however given birth to hopes that the fir&s;t is not &s;till unattainable, and induced me to flatter my&s;elf that &s;hould &s;he deign to allow of my mo&s;t zealous endeavours to contribute to it, it may not prove be|yond my power in &s;ome mea&s;ure to con|&s;ole her for what &s;he has lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Do not however imagine, that I &s;hall &s;o far de&s;cend from my age and charac|ter as to be offended by a refu&s;al. An admirer at my time of life mu&s;t not pre|tend to a&s;&s;ume the lover of twenty. I am aware of the great inequality of our years, and of many other objections your
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;i&s;ter may feel, and the force of which &s;he may not be able to &s;urmount. If howe|ver &s;he thinks, after con&s;ulting with you, that there are any advantages to compen|&s;ate the&s;e ob&s;tacles, if the warme&s;t at|tachment and the mo&s;t unbounded in|dulgence, if my legal protection, and the command of a fortune much too narrow, alas! for her preten&s;ions and almo&s;t be|neath her acceptance, yet with which I flatter my&s;elf a mind like her's could be contented;&mdash;if the&s;e circum&s;tances weigh in any degree again&s;t the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, I mu&s;t &s;o far adopt the language of a lo|ver as to declare that &s;he will literally render me the happie&s;t of men. I &s;hall receive her hand as a fre&s;h ble&s;&s;ing from heaven, and regard it as a conde&s;cen&s;ion for which I &s;hall ever con&s;ider my&s;elf her debtor.</P>
<P>Some hints in this &s;peech of Mr. How|ard's had confu&s;ed me &s;o extremely, that I made no attempt to an&s;wer or interrupt
<PB N="8" REF="9">
him, except by bowing my head in ac|knowledgment of the compliments he paid me. Finding however that he now expected a reply, I thanked him in my &s;i&s;ter's name for the honour of his good opinion; as to what &s;ucce&s;s his propo&s;al might receive, I declared my&s;elf wholly ignorant; grateful &s;he cannot fail to prove, &s;aid I, but what lengths that &s;en|timent may carry her, I am unable to conjecture.</P>
<P>If Mi&s;s Fanny, &s;aid he, elated with the gay hopes and lively pro&s;pects of youth, &s;hould think with reluctance on uniting her&s;elf to a man who&s;e age corre&s;ponds &s;o ill with her own, I mu&s;t regret with fervor, but never &s;hall repine at her de|termination. There is one ob&s;tacle how|ever, Mi&s;s Seymour, which &s;everely damps my feeble hopes, and is indeed the circum&s;tance that has induced me to open my intentions fir&s;t to you, as it is a particular in which I imagine you can
<PB N="9" REF="10">
fully &s;atisfy me, and on which it &s;olely depends whether I &s;hall immediately mention this intere&s;ting &s;ubject to your &s;i&s;ter, or be &s;ilent on it for ever. I have remarked, &s;ince her abode here, that your &s;i&s;ter has had a very zealous admirer, who cannot have failed I imagine in pro|fiting from the many opportunities he has enjoyed of &s;oliciting her favor.</P>
<P>Of Captain Wilmot, cried I, you need have no apprehen&s;ions. I hope you do Fanny the ju&s;tice to believe that the a&s;&s;i|duities of &s;uch a rival are by no means formidable.</P>
<P>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at lea&s;t youth and good looks in his favour, replied Mr. How|ard; but you relieve my mind from a weight of painful anxiety, as this is a bar which mu&s;t not only have proved wholly in&s;urmountable, but one of tho&s;e to ob|viate which I could not even have at|tempted; for though I &s;hall not expect the heart of my mi&s;tre&s;s, I mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a
<PB N="10" REF="11">
certain degree of her attachment; a wi&s;h to plea&s;e, and a willingne&s;s to be plea&s;ed, on which to build my hopes of gaining the affections of my wife: without this I &s;hould be my&s;elf mi&s;erable, nor would it be in my power to render her happy.</P>
<P>If &s;he cannot compleatly be&s;tow her heart, my dear Sir, cried I, may &s;he like|wi&s;e withhold her hand. But I am cer|tain my &s;i&s;ter is too &s;en&s;ible of the value of your's, to trifle with a propo&s;al &s;o ge|nerous and di&s;intere&s;ted. If&mdash;for our af|fections are not always in our own power, and the caprice of ta&s;te is but too often at variance with rea&s;on and judgment&mdash;if &s;he cannot make a proper return, I am certain you have too much delicacy to wi&s;h her your's and too much good &s;en&s;e to be offended.</P>
<P>Offended! Mi&s;s Seymour: be a&s;&s;ured I never &s;hall be offended; and believe me, hardly &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>As Mr. Howard pronounced the&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="12">
words, Fanny opened the door of the dre&s;&s;ing room and looked in. The la|dies, cried &s;he, are much a&s;toni&s;hed at your long ab&s;ence; and Mrs. Hindon is &s;o entertained with your tete a tete, that &s;he is ab&s;olutely become witty on the oc|ca&s;ion. I wi&s;h you would therefore ap|pear in your own defence, for I am quite fatigued in finding excu&s;es for you.</P>
<P>This &s;he &s;aid with an air of gaiety that was in&s;tantly checked on perceiving the embarra&s;&s;ment her &s;udden appearance at this juncture occa&s;ioned. Mr. Howard &s;eemed rather at a lo&s;s, and on his account I could not avoid feeling con&s;cious. Fan|ny finding I an&s;wered her with &s;ome de|gree of awkwardne&s;s, looked fir&s;t to the one, then to the other, as if with a de&s;ign of penetrating into the cau&s;e of our being &s;o evidently di&s;concerted; and ob&s;erving the raillery in the drawing room accord &s;o well with the confu&s;ed &s;ituation into which her appearance had thrown us,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;he gave way to an expre&s;&s;ive &s;mile, and regarding me with an air that &s;ufficiently explained her &s;u&s;picions, ha&s;tily &s;hut the dre&s;&s;ing-room door, and departed as if determined not to interrupt us.</P>
<P>At this little manoeuvre, which plainly di&s;covered her fal&s;e conclu&s;ions on &s;ur|prizing us, I could not refrain from laughing; and even Mr. Howard was not able to re&s;i&s;t half &s;miling at her mi&s;|take. We then &s;eparated; but I was forced to &s;upport the whole weight of Mrs. Hindon's ridicule on being &s;o long tete a tete with her brother. Her wit, however deficient in other re&s;pects, claims the merit of being voluble and keen in the extreme; but happily the entrance of more company &s;oon relieved me.</P>
<P>Fanny's countenance during the whole evening exhibited a picture of &s;ly mean|ing and &s;ignificance, which it was ex|tremely amu&s;ing to behold. Every fea|ture &s;eemed filled with the importance of
<PB N="13" REF="14">
a newly-di&s;covered &s;ecret: but in &s;o large a party all explanation was impo&s;&s;ible; and indeed had &s;he ever found an op|portunity for importuning me on the &s;ubject, I had determined in my own mind to leave her under the influence of an unju&s;t &s;urmi&s;e rather than anticipate Mr. Howard's declaration.</P>
<P>One of the company happening to mention with great encomiums an Italian performer who is expected in this coun|try in the cour&s;e of a month, all the la|dies were expre&s;&s;ing their eager expecta|tions of then &s;eeing him. I fancy Her|mione, whi&s;pered Fanny, we &s;hall be mighty &s;nug at Hubert Hill, (Mr. How|ard's country &s;eat,) by that time.</P>
<P>Perhaps we may, returned I with a gay air, which confirming her &s;u&s;picions ap|peared to give her much delight.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard at that in&s;tant joining us, &s;he &s;eemed ready to laugh in his face out of <HI>gayet&ecirc; du coeur.</HI> Oh! cried &s;he, &s;till
<PB N="14" REF="15">
in a &s;oft voice to me, it will be &s;o delight|ful; tho' to own the truth I was afraid that haughty cou&s;in of ours might have &s;tood in the way.</P>
<P>You are intirely out of the &s;ecret, &s;aid I. But pray be quiet.</P>
<P>We were then called to a party at Com|merce, and an end put to our little tete a tete, which merely &s;erved to &s;trengthen Fanny in her error. Oh, thought I to my&s;elf, while I ob&s;erved her eyes &s;parkle with the pro&s;pect of a happy termination thus appearing to the uncertainties and difficulties of our pre&s;ent uncomfortable &s;ituation, will the &s;ame &s;atisfaction brighten your countenance and lighten your heart, my deare&s;t Fanny, when you find you are your&s;elf the object that is to in&s;ure us this advantage.</P>
<P>Captain Wilmot, who has been (per|haps de&s;ignedly,) out of town ever &s;ince our affairs have worn an unfavourable ap|pearance, came in for a few moments.
<PB N="15" REF="16">
His addre&s;s to Fanny was con&s;trained; her's to him, haughty, di&s;dainful, and contemptuous. It is not like Fanny to &s;hew &s;o much &s;pirit; but affronted va|nity will it &s;eems excite a pride otherwi&s;e foreign to the character. It was ea&s;y to di&s;cern that he had been apprized of the change in our circum&s;tances. Every word, every look and motion, betrayed not the timidity of a lover but the em|barra&s;&s;ment and perplexity of a man who felt him&s;elf involved in difficulties and knew not how to act. I was charmed with Fanny's behaviour. She not only &s;upported her own dignity, but com|pleatly mortified the poor Captain, who tho' happy to be thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, could not feel much gratified from perceiving the indifference with which the conque&s;t was relinqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>When the company were gone, and Fanny and I by our&s;elves, &s;he interrogated me as to the tete a tete conver&s;ation that
<PB N="16" REF="17">
had pa&s;&s;ed; but I per&s;i&s;ted in evading all her enquiries; for it is but ju&s;tice to al|low Mr. Howard to plead his own cau&s;e, while her mind is unbia&s;&s;ed by any pre|vious determination. Let him at lea&s;t reap what benefit may re&s;ult from an un|prejudiced &s;urprize on finding her&s;elf warmly &s;olicited by a man whom I know &s;he e&s;teems and re&s;pects.</P>
<P>I believe you will not be a&s;toni&s;hed, when I confe&s;s that did I think this a point in which it would be allowable for me to interfere, I &s;hould prove a warm advocate in Mr. Howard's favour, and that I anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h this union may take place. Did Fanny's heart feel the &s;light|e&s;t repugnance, far &s;hould I be from de|&s;iring an event, again&s;t which in that ca&s;e principle and delicacy would equally revolt: but if &s;he is capable of enter|taining &s;uch &s;entiments as will allow her without reluctance to be&s;tow her hand on that amiable man, I think I could al|mo&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="18">
pronounce her felicity in the mar|riage &s;tate &s;ecured; and what a happy a&s;ylum in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation mu&s;t the hou&s;e of Mr. Howard prove, when au|thori&s;ed to live under his continued pro|tection by the ties of relation&s;hip as well as by tho&s;e of friend&s;hip. It is indeed an event which mu&s;t at once relieve us from the difficulties that &s;eem to await our un|connected &s;tate. Yet you may conjec|ture I would not for worlds in&s;inuate a hint towards urging her to a &s;tep with which, in her place, I feel at this moment I my&s;elf could not comply.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter &s;eemed di&s;appointed on find|ing her conjectures had been without foundation, and warmly joined in &s;ound|ing the prai&s;es of Mr. Howard; adding, that in &s;pite of the di&s;proportion of our ages there was no man &s;he would e&s;teem &s;o highly as a brother. Yet Sophia, di&s;|intere&s;ted as we &s;ometimes flatter our|&s;elves we are, we view with different
<PB N="18" REF="19">
eyes the &s;ame object when regarded as our own choice or as that of even our deare&s;t and mo&s;t intimate friend; and forcible as were Fanny's expre&s;&s;ions, I cannot conjecture with any degree of cer|tainty how &s;he will act. My influence over her mind is not trifling; but even were I &s;till more convinced than I am that I &s;hould a&s;certain her happine&s;s by promoting this affair, I &s;hould not po&s;&s;e&s;s re&s;olution &s;ufficient for interfering on a point of &s;uch infinite moment, e&s;pecially at this time, when a peculiar delicacy de|ters me. Fanny, on my account as well as her own, may wi&s;h to conquer a re|luctance &s;o adver&s;e to our mutual comfort and which &s;o many powerful motives of prudence and rea&s;on oppo&s;e, while at the &s;ame time this conflict may prove &s;o &s;e|vere, that it were cruelty to advi&s;e a &s;tep which may in this ca&s;e be denominated a &s;acrifice.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="20">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SUNDAY EVENING.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>On our return from morning prayers, I retired to read in my own apartment. Fanny remained in the parlour below, but joined me an hour after in the utmo&s;t per|turbation. On entering, &s;he ha&s;tily ap|proached me, and throwing her arms around my neck, bur&s;t into a flood of tears, which in&s;tantly informed me of what &s;he was unable by words to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t girl, &s;aid I, whence pro|ceeds this agitation?</P>
<P>She could not immediately reply: but at la&s;t&mdash;Oh Hermione! exclaimed &s;he, what have I to tell you&mdash;Mr. Howard is my lover.</P>
<P>Well my dear, &s;aid I &s;miling, that is no very great calamity.</P>
<P>Good, heavens! could you ever have &s;u&s;pected &s;uch a thing? Could you ever have imagined that any thing &s;o unlucky would have happened!</P>
<P>I believe I could, an&s;wered I. But
<PB N="20" REF="21">
why unlucky? How comes it that the mere mention of a propo&s;al which mu&s;t be at lea&s;t acknowledged di&s;intere&s;ted, from an amiable and worthy object, &s;hould give you this unea&s;ine&s;s. There are no rigid guardians to urge your com|pliance, nor, alas! parents to command your obedience; and believe me, my love, your &s;i&s;ter will not even pre&s;ume to ad|vi&s;e on a &s;ubject in which your own feel|ings and &s;entiments only are to be con|&s;ulted.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found, however, that her tears were tho&s;e of agitation, doubt, and timi|dity. Di&s;gu&s;t and repugnance had no part in her emotions. She confe&s;&s;ed &s;he e&s;teemed Mr. Howard; that &s;he believed him one of the be&s;t men in the world; but I never once thought of being his wife, &s;aid &s;he. I regarded him as a friend &s;ent by heaven to con&s;ole us for the lo&s;s of one parent who is gone for ever, and of another who di&s;owns us. I cannot
<PB N="21" REF="22">
think of marrying him. The idea is al|mo&s;t unnatural; for the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an event never entered my imagina|tion. Indeed I always concluded his partiality to me was that of a father, and that the di&s;parity of our years would have alone proved &s;ufficient to have prevented the very notion of &s;uch an attachment. Had it been you, I &s;hould not have ex|perienced the &s;lighte&s;t &s;urprize; for I have more than once &s;u&s;pected that he loved you, particularly before we left Languedoc; but for my&s;elf, I always imagined he viewed me in the light of a girl who might have amu&s;ed perhaps, but who had no likelihood of intere&s;ting him. Oh! what made him think of me, re|peated &s;he &s;everal times in the greate&s;t perplexity.</P>
<P>Calm your agitation my dear Fanny, cried I. Con&s;ider you are &s;olicited, but not compelled. I have on my part long &s;u&s;pected that you was the object of Mr.
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Howard's affections, and I &s;incerely own have &s;ecretly wi&s;hed his pa&s;&s;ion that &s;uc|ce&s;s which in my opinion it &s;o ju&s;tly me|rits. I am convinced the attachment and protection of a character like his mu&s;t &s;e|cure happine&s;s to the woman whom he honours with his choice, provided her heart is properly di&s;po&s;ed for feeling and an&s;wering the tenderne&s;s of his. If this is however wanting, believe me Mr. Howard him&s;elf has too much delicacy to demand the hand which prudence alone be&s;tows on him; and I am certain po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es too large a &s;hare both of good &s;en&s;e and mode&s;ty to be di&s;obliged. If then you feel the lea&s;t actual repugnance to this union, after having maturely weighed and con&s;idered all &s;ides of the que&s;tion, he&s;itate not to tell him &s;o without co|quetry or affectation.</P>
<P>Repugnance is a &s;trong word, &s;aid &s;he, after a pau&s;e. We are under infinite ob|ligations to him, and he is our only friend.
<PB N="23" REF="24">
I &s;hould be &s;hocked to di&s;oblige him. But he has &s;o &s;urprized me, that I know not what to think of the matter, nor how to collect my &s;cattered thoughts to pon|der on the con&s;equences. Now tell me &s;eriou&s;ly Hermione, what would you do in my ca&s;e?</P>
<P>Why I will tell you &s;incerely, &s;aid I. Were I you, with your di&s;po&s;ition, your gratitude to Mr. Howard, and your indif|ference to every other man, I believe I &s;hould be his wife.</P>
<P>Yet I am not the lea&s;t in love with him, cried &s;he.</P>
<P>Involuntarily I was about to reply, that being romantically in love was by all ac|counts far from an indi&s;pen&s;ible requi&s;ite towards happine&s;s in the married &s;tate; but con&s;cious how different my own pri|vate &s;entiments were from according with this opinion, I checked my&s;elf from touching on an argument that carried not conviction to my own mind, though from
<PB N="24" REF="25">
my knowledge of Fanny's temper it might have been not improperly offered to her, and only added, that her own feelings mu&s;t direct her.</P>
<P>We were interrupted by Mrs. Hindon, who came to inform us that the carriage waited to carry us to afternoon prayers. I believe poor Fanny's devotions were not a little di&s;turbed; and on our return I ob&s;erved &s;he met the eyes of Mr. How|ard with a confu&s;ion which &s;eemed to forebode no great &s;everity.</P>
<P>I had evidently &s;hewn on which &s;ide my &s;uffrage re&s;ted; but I cautiou&s;ly withheld any advice likely to prejudice her mind, which tho' diffident and fear|ful, appeared neither aver&s;e nor deter|mined.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>FEB. 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WELL, my dear Sophia, after di&s;|appointments &s;o &s;evere, and pro&s;pects &s;o chearle&s;s and dreary, the &s;cene begins to brighten. Fanny has at la&s;t yielded in Mr. Howard's favour, and finds her&s;elf perfectly &s;atisfied and at ea&s;e now that her future fate &s;eems determined.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard appears delighted with his good fortune, tho' a propriety of feeling peculiar to him&s;elf deters him from te&s;tifying it in a manner too pointed. An admirer after forty mu&s;t not, as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, adopt the behaviour of one twenty years younger. There is a
<PB N="26" REF="27">
dignity &s;uited to that period, which even love, all-powerful love, mu&s;t not entirely di&s;card. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the tenderne&s;s, while he has exploded the flights of a lover; and Fanny, who imagined that court&s;hip mu&s;t be &s;erious, aweful and for|mal, and that &s;he &s;hould find an unu&s;ual embarra&s;&s;ment attend her new &s;ituation, is charmed to perceive that Mr. Howard is exactly what he was before, and that &s;he is if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more at ea&s;e with him than formerly.</P>
<P>This is rendered more practicable, as they have taken the precaution of keep|ing the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs a pro|found &s;ecret from this family; nor do they intend informing them how matters are likely to be concluded till it is un|nece&s;&s;ary any longer to retain them in ignorance. Indeed Mrs. Hindon's entire di&s;regard of delicacy, added to her pa&s;|&s;ion for raillery, makes her the la&s;t per|&s;on
<PB N="27" REF="28">
with whom one would incline to in|tru&s;t a &s;ubject of this nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard is extremely urgent with Fanny to have the ceremony which is to unite them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible performed; and as a thou&s;and rea&s;ons con&s;pire to make us wi&s;h our&s;elves no longer a burthen on the con&s;trained civilities of Mrs. Hindon, Fanny has promi&s;ed that after the u&s;ual forms of law are concluded, &s;he &s;hall not invent unnece&s;&s;ary delays.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t Mrs. Hindon has more than once renewed her favorite topic. It is not without infinite reluctance that &s;he relinqui&s;hes any plan to which in her own mind &s;he has attached an importance. Lady Farnford however &s;eems to have given up all hope; and her &s;on, I under|&s;tand from Mi&s;s Par&s;ons, has been twice refu&s;ed admittance at Mrs. Hindon's door, in pur&s;uance no doubt of his mo|ther's reque&s;t to her friend to give no countenance or encouragement to a pa&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
now deprived of all the o&s;tentatious advantages that once rendered it &s;o de|&s;irable.</P>
<P>Captain Wilmot appears to bear his di&s;appointment with an admirable good grace; though the frigid hauteur with which Fanny behaved to him the even|ing they met, by di&s;covering the uncon|cern of her heart, and opening his eyes to the fal&s;ity of his &s;elf-&s;ufficient &s;ecurity of her affections, mu&s;t have proved very little gratifying to the all-potent vanity of his character. He has taken care to be con&s;tantly engaged ever &s;ince, except one morning, when he found courage to &s;tep in for ten minutes. Fanny was a|bove &s;tairs when he entered; but fol|lowed him a &s;hort time after into the parlour. He blu&s;hed extremely, and appeared much embarra&s;&s;ed on paying her the u&s;ual compliments; nor did his awkwardne&s;s &s;eem le&s;s con&s;picuous from an air of forced gayety with which he en|deavoured
<PB N="29" REF="30">
to di&s;gui&s;e it. Finding his &s;ituation, in &s;pite of all his efforts, ex|ceedingly uncomfortable, he made ha&s;te to change it, and abruptly took leave.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">

<P>Fanny and Mr. Howard have this day had a long conver&s;ation together, in the cour&s;e of which he laid before her the &s;tate of his finances, and &s;ugge&s;ted the plan of life which he thought would be mo&s;t conducive to their mutual happine&s;s.</P>
<P>His paternal e&s;tate, Hubert Hill, does not exceed three hundred and twenty pounds a year; and this, with a couple of thou&s;ands bequeathed him by a friend, con&s;titutes his whole fortune; nor has he any addition to hope for independent of my &s;i&s;ter's precarious pittance when Mr. Ben&s;eley's affairs are &s;ettled. This no doubt is a very &s;lender income, e&s;pecially
<PB N="30" REF="31">
if a numerous family &s;hould ble&s;s their union; yet as Mr. Howard is a man of moderate views, and addicted to no ex|pen&s;ive plea&s;ures, and Fanny has ever been accu&s;tomed to &s;olitude and fruga|lity if not ab&s;olutely to a &s;trict oecono|my, I think it &s;ufficient, with &s;ome at|tention, for all the nece&s;&s;ary indulgencies of life.</P>
<P>His little feat is &s;ituated, he &s;ays, in a delightful part of the country. The grounds are laid out with ta&s;te; and the hou&s;e, tho' &s;mall, is fitted up with infi|nite neatne&s;s in a ru&s;tic &s;tyle. This he propo&s;es making their con&s;tant re&s;idence; and hopes, by living him&s;elf on the &s;pot, to improve it to great advantage, being extremely fond of farming him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He did not fail, in the very fir&s;t mo|ments of Fanny's approbation, to give me the warme&s;t and mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing invi|tation to join their family. Indeed with|out that condition I believe he never
<PB N="31" REF="32">
would have prevailed with his bride, for &s;he has ever expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t painful reluctance at the idea of being &s;eparated from me. It was no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me however, to perceive the cordiality and eagerne&s;s with which Mr. Howard made this reque&s;t. Partial as I have al|ways been, &s;aid he, to the abode of my youth, with how much delight mu&s;t I now enjoy it, when ble&s;t with compa|nions who po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of converting any &s;pot into a paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;ets out for Hubert Hill to-mor|row, to give the nece&s;&s;ary directions previous to our going down; and in the mean while all other preparations are making, that the ceremony may take place as &s;oon as he returns. Are you not entertained with Fanny's metamor|pho&s;is into a &s;edate, ru&s;tic farmer's wife, who when you knew her but three years ago was a little wild giddy girl of thir|teen. I am &s;atisfied however &s;he will
<PB N="32" REF="33">
conduct her&s;elf to admiration in that ca|pacity. She is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very chear|ful, contented di&s;po&s;ition, the fir&s;t ble&s;|&s;ing of Providence; and the rever&s;es of fortune which the la&s;t five months have produced, by compleatly convincing her of the fallaciou&s;ne&s;s of her &s;anguine ex|pectations of the gay enjoyments of the world, formed in ignorance and &s;olitude, have di&s;po&s;ed her mind for reli&s;hing and returning to the pure plea&s;ures of retire|ment and dome&s;tic life. In &s;ociety, &s;he has experienced only mortifications, di&s;|appointments, and di&s;gu&s;ts, in&s;tead of finding it, as &s;he had concluded, a &s;cene of perpetual gaiety, admiration, and de|light. In lieu of univer&s;al conque&s;t, her admirers have been tran&s;ient, and her lover in&s;incere. She has made no friends &s;ince &s;he left France; and is therefore the more eager to cement to her&s;elf him who has proved on trial &s;trongly and truly at|tached to her.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">As for my&s;elf, this event is every thing I can wi&s;h. It &s;ecures me an agreeable home with tho&s;e I love, and conveys me from this hateful city, which I wi&s;h from my &s;oul I had never entered.</P>

<P>Mr. Howard is returned from his ex|cur&s;ion, much plea&s;ed with &s;ome little improvements he has begun; and the papers are now ready for &s;igning. Mr. Howard, in the event of no family, leaves his wife &s;ole heire&s;s of all he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es: but &s;hould any children &s;pring from this marriage, her jointure is two hundred per annum. Having no friend to con&s;ult on this occa&s;ion, all &s;he feared was Mr. Howard's too great genero&s;ity; and as &s;he was a&s;hamed even to mention pecuniary matters to him, I was unwil|lingly obliged on this occa&s;ion to be her
<PB N="34" REF="35">
agent, and ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted that if her own money, &s;hould any be recovered, was &s;ettled upon her as he propo&s;ed, a deduction of equal value &s;hould be made from this &s;tipulation. Every thing there|fore relative to &s;ettlements is finally ad|ju&s;ted; and but that Fanny's timidity makes her catch at trifles to delay the aweful ceremony, things ere now would have been concluded.</P>
<P>Fearing Mrs. Hindon would be ex|tremely di&s;obliged at Fanny's conduct in concealing from her this affair, I per|&s;uaded her the other day to confe&s;s her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and &s;ugge&s;ted that as that lady, from whatever motives, had received us into her family, and te&s;tified towards us a thou&s;and civilities with great apparent ho&s;pitality and kindne&s;s, &s;he had rea&s;on to be not a little offended at the want of confidence and cordiality this &s;ecrecy betrayed; be&s;ides common report would &s;oon render all further con|cealment
<PB N="35" REF="36">
u&s;ele&s;s, and deprive Fanny of an opportunity of paying her the com|pliment of confidence.</P>
<P>She intreated me to undertake this commi&s;&s;ion for her. It was not an agree|able one; but as to Fanny it would per|haps have been &s;till more awkward, I con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Good heavens! cried Mrs. Hindon, as &s;oon as I had hinted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he connection which was likely &s;oon to place my &s;i&s;ter among the li&s;t of her relations&mdash;married to my brother! Mi&s;s Fanny to be my brother's wife! Well I declare he is extremely &s;ly, for I could have laid a bet that you were his favorite of the two. He is a bold man however, to think of incumbering him&s;elf with a wife and fa|mily in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. I wi&s;h them happy with all my heart; but I plainly perceive he had his own private rea&s;ons for regarding my poor nephew's propo&s;als with &s;o much di&s;approbation.
<PB N="36" REF="37">
Well, every one for them&s;elves in this world; but I always &s;u&s;pect &s;ome &s;elf-intere&s;ted motive at bottom when I hear &s;uch a piece of work made about <HI>&s;enti|ment,</HI> and &s;o many profe&s;&s;ions of <HI>di&s;in|tere&s;ted friend&s;hip</HI>; I think be&s;ides, &s;ince matters were &s;o far advanced, that Mr. Hindon and my&s;elf might have been &s;ooner made acquainted with a love af|fair that was going on under our own roof.</P>
<P>I pleaded Fanny's diffidence as an apo|logy; but my excu&s;e was in fact ex|tremely lame, and was not ea&s;ily admit|ted. Mrs. Hindon could with difficulty prevail on her&s;elf to pardon the di&s;re&s;pect. But this &s;tory had gone in all points &s;o contrary to her plans and wi&s;hes, that I could forgive a little ill humour occa|&s;ioned by chagrin, and found it not on the whole &s;o hard to reconcile her to it as I had feared. A marriage, tho' even not of her own negociating, afforded &s;ome
<PB N="37" REF="38">
&s;peculation for her active mind to work on; and &s;o fond is &s;he of being officiou&s;ly bu&s;y, that &s;he has &s;et off to-day, accom|panied by Fanny, to a&s;&s;i&s;t with the ut|mo&s;t cordiality and eagerne&s;s in the pur|cha&s;e of &s;ome bridal apparatus.</P>

<P>I had hardly laid down my pen this morning, when Mr. Roat&s;ley was an|nounced. The &s;ight of him, &s;o wholly unprepared as I was for the interview, threw me into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and I am certain I mu&s;t have performed the fir&s;t ceremonials with great awkwardne&s;s. The recollection of his late conver&s;ation with Mr. Howard, of which I had been &s;olely the &s;ubject, and the obligations his generous conduct had laid me under, overpowered me with embarra&s;&s;ment. I knew not how to expre&s;s my gratitude
<PB N="38" REF="39">
for a &s;ervice &s;o e&s;&s;ential, which yet from a thou&s;and circum&s;tances I blu&s;hed to remember, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;carce courage to touch on: added to this, the di&s;co|very I had made &s;ince our la&s;t meeting, and the mortifications attending our re|jected application to his family, &s;truck me &s;o forcibly, that I was in agitation inexpre&s;&s;ible when he entered.</P>
<P>He comes, thought I, at once to con|vince me how injurious were my &s;u&s;pi|cions of his pride and duplicity, to ex|pre&s;s his regret for the ill conduct of his relations, and to &s;hew me how di&s;&s;imilar is his generous mind from that of his un|feeling mother.</P>
<P>So certain was I of the intention of his vi&s;it, that I even wi&s;hed the explanation over, which mu&s;t to him prove &s;o em|barra&s;&s;ing, as it was likely &s;o little to redound to the honor of his family, and expected every moment when the &s;ubject &s;hould be introduced. But mo&s;t care|fully
<PB N="39" REF="40">
did he guard again&s;t every topic that could lead to this point; which he evidently avoided with the mo&s;t &s;edulous precaution. Yet his manner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that in&s;inuating attention, and his voice that winning &s;oftne&s;s, which &s;eemed to imply the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction in my com|pany, and which be&s;tows on <HI>his</HI> a charm, that may be felt, Sophia, alas, too a|cutely! but which cannot be delineated.</P>
<P>The intere&s;ting elegance of his addre&s;s is indeed &s;o uncommonly engaging, that I think it mu&s;t be wholly impo&s;&s;ible even for a &s;tranger to behold him enter with|out plea&s;ure, or &s;ee him depart without experiencing regret. It is not alone that he is perfectly well bred and intelligent, for from moderate parts, poli&s;hed by education and knowledge of the world, this may be expected, and uncharacte|ri&s;tic of the Engli&s;h nation as the refine|ment of good breeding is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, I have &s;een, &s;ince my re&s;idence here,
<PB N="40" REF="41">
more than one per&s;on to whom I think that panegyric is ju&s;tly due; but Mr. Roat&s;ley's mind &s;peaks in his counte|nance and in his manner, and confers on every look and on every motion that grace which a di&s;po&s;ition compleatly amiable, and talents thoroughly well cul|tivated, cannot fail to diffu&s;e over the appearance and behaviour.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t flutters giving way to the re|&s;pectful ea&s;e of his conver&s;ation, I took courage at length to mention the obliga|tion I owed him. I have been inex|pre&s;&s;ibly de&s;irous, &s;aid I, of an opportu|nity to return you my mo&s;t grateful ac|knowledgments for the attention and trouble you have been &s;o humane as to be&s;tow upon an affair which has occa|&s;ioned me more unea&s;ine&s;s and perplex|ity than it is po&s;&s;ible to conceive.</P>
<P>I am then extremely &s;orry, cried he with warmth, that my pre&s;ence &s;hould have induced you for an in&s;tant to recall
<PB N="41" REF="42">
a &s;ubject &s;o painful. Let it be bani&s;hed, I be&s;eech you, for ever from your re|membrance, and along with it all ex|pre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to which I cannot flatter my&s;elf I merit the &s;lighte&s;t claim. Heaven knows what exertions I would make, what anxiety I would undergo, to merit the approbation of Mi&s;s Seymour; but as yet I am not &s;o happy as to con|gratulate my&s;elf with having had it in my power to perform any &s;ervice that could de&s;erve her thanks. Let me know my dear Madam, added he, by what means I can procure a title to that happi|ne&s;s, and you &s;hall perceive, by the avi|dity with which I &s;hall obey your com|mands, how infinitely I &s;hould prize my good fortune in obliging you.</P>
<P>Does he wi&s;h me, thought I, to apply to him to interceed with Lord Belmont; or are the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions mere words of cour&s;e, to which are annexed neither meaning nor intention. I was piqued
<PB N="42" REF="43">
that he adhered &s;o determinedly to the re&s;olutions of his relations, and only made a &s;light inclination of my head very gravely in return to this &s;peech.</P>
<P>A degree of &s;urprize was evident in his countenance at the &s;tateline&s;s of my man|ner; the cau&s;e I think he mu&s;t have been with ea&s;e able to comprehend. However he cho&s;e to place it to another account; and finding that an air of chagrin invo|luntarily hung on my features&mdash;&mdash;Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;aid he, after &s;everal ineffectual attempts to amu&s;e me on different &s;ub|jects which a &s;light degree of penetration &s;ufficed to &s;hew did not intere&s;t me&mdash;I cannot but perceive that I have been &s;o unfortunate as to offend you; and &s;o &s;e|vere, &s;o painful is this idea, that tho' my confe&s;&s;ion may at fir&s;t rather encrea&s;e than dimini&s;h your di&s;plea&s;ure, I cannot re&s;i&s;t tru&s;ting to your candour and indul|gence by a &s;incere avowal of the only circum&s;tance wherein I think it is po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="43" REF="44">
for me to have given cau&s;e for your di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Finding I made no reply, for in truth I knew not what to an&s;wer&mdash;I &s;incerely confe&s;s, continued be, and let, I be&s;eech you, the &s;everity of this confe&s;&s;ion plead in my behalf, that after having been ble&s;t with your company that happy even|ing at Dover, my ideas and expectations of the dignity of your behaviour were rai&s;ed to &s;o ju&s;t an height, that they could not but &s;uffer &s;ome abatement on witne&s;&s;ing what I could not but con&s;ider as an impropriety, and which I am cer|tain Mi&s;s Seymour her&s;elf would have regarded as an indelicacy. I am con|&s;cious I ought to have judged le&s;s ra&s;hly. I know that I ought to have &s;u&s;pected my own eyes, rather than any indecorum in you; but I was led to do you inju&s;tice by a multiplicity of circum&s;tances, which can hardly have given more pain to your feelings than they have conveyed to mine;
<PB N="44" REF="45">
and you may recollect, Madam, that the in&s;tant you appeared &s;till more unac|countable, in&s;tead of plunging deeper into doubt, I penetrated into the whole my&s;tery, and not only in my own mind fully acquitted you of the imprudence of a clande&s;tine interview with a young man who merited only your &s;corn and de|te&s;tation, but al&s;o immediately perceived that though the whole was wrapt in ob|&s;curity, the veil was not placed over your conduct by your own hands; and I no longer he&s;itated to a&s;k an explanation from Mr. Howard, &s;ince I was com|pleatly convinced all mu&s;t redound to your honour.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, cried I, penetrated by this &s;peech and the eagerne&s;s with which he entered on his ju&s;tification, be a&s;&s;ured when I reflect on this painful affair, it is not only without the &s;lighte&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure at any part of your conduct, but with
<PB N="45" REF="46">
the utmo&s;t gratitude for the humane in|tere&s;t you te&s;tified in it.</P>
<P>May I then flatter my&s;elf I am forgiv|en, cried he warmly, and ki&s;&s;ed my hand with a fervor that dyed me with Crim&s;on.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t withdrawn it, when Mrs. Hindon and Fanny returned from their excur&s;ion, followed by a &s;ervant loaded with various purcha&s;es.</P>
<P>I introduced Mr. Roat&s;ley to Mrs. Hindon, who appeared much delighted with the acqui&s;ition of an acquaintance of his rank and figure, and began con|ver&s;ing with her accu&s;tomed volubility and avidity even before &s;he had &s;eated her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;he held a pretty large parcel in her hands, part of Fanny's paraphranalia, he politely offered to relieve her by plac|ing it on the table.</P>
<P>Perhaps Sir, cried &s;he facetiou&s;ly, the&s;e ladies may generou&s;ly reward your
<PB N="46" REF="47">
trouble by pre&s;enting you with part of the contents.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be much delighted with the honor of any gift from the&s;e ladies, re|turned he. But pray may I be allowed to a&s;k of what nature is the donation?</P>
<P>Poor Fanny blu&s;hed up to the ears. Good God, Madam! cried &s;he, with a reproachful look.</P>
<P>Nay, an&s;wered &s;he, laughing immode|rately, I'm &s;ure I &s;han't tell; but if Mr. Roat&s;ley &s;hould be clever enough to gue&s;s it, you know neither of us can help that. Lord, look, look, cried &s;he with entire di&s;regard to Fanny's confu&s;ion, how con|&s;cious Mi&s;s Fanny appears of the &s;ecret: and Mi&s;s Seymour, I declare &s;he blu&s;hes too, as much as to &s;ay&mdash;but I mu&s;t take care not to blab.</P>
<P>Roat&s;ley &s;miled at our mutual confu|&s;ion; for indeed I felt extremely for poor Fanny, and was not a little a&s;hamed al&s;o for Mrs. Hindon's indelicate raillery.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">If my enquiries give the ladies &s;o much pain, &s;aid he, I am afraid I mu&s;t be contented to remain in ignorance; tho' I confe&s;s my curio&s;ity is rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch to di&s;cover this important &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Mr. Hindon ju&s;t then entered; and an introduction taking place between him and Mr. Roat&s;ley, I was in hopes Fanny would have been relieved from her per|&s;ecution. His lady, however, &s;eemed determined &s;uch an excellent joke &s;hould not have &s;o &s;peedy a termination.</P>
<P>My dear, cried &s;he, let us &s;ee if <HI>you</HI>
can &s;olve this riddle, which has puzzled Mr. Roat&s;ley's brain in vain to unravel, and the bare mention of which has plunged the&s;e ladies into the mo&s;t painful confu&s;ion. The &s;ecret, or rather the &s;o|lution, is contained in that package of brown paper that lies on the table.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take a very &s;imple method of di&s;covery, returned he, and &s;eizing the
<PB N="48" REF="49">
parcel as Fanny was flying to &s;ecure it, he in&s;tantly cut the packthread with which it was tied, and holding it above her reach a number of favors compo&s;ed of white and &s;ilver dropt on the ground.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret is di&s;covered at length, ex|claimed Mrs. Hindon, laughing with great vociferation. Well I'm &s;ure ladies you need not care much, for it is of a nature that will &s;oon &s;peak for it&s;elf, and I'm &s;ure you mu&s;t acknowledge I &s;aid never a word of the matter.</P>
<P>It is then a matrimonial one I pre&s;ume, &s;aid Mr. Roat&s;ley, with a con&s;trained air and in a very low voice to Mrs. Hindon.</P>
<P>Yes, returned &s;he, &s;miling expre&s;&s;ively as if &s;he was not at liberty to &s;atisfy him further, though &s;he evidently &s;eemed impelled by a &s;trong inclination to enter upon family tran&s;actions, equally un&s;oli|cited and impertinent.</P>
<P>Poor Fanny returned to her &s;eat much a&s;hamed and confu&s;ed; while Mr. Hin|don
<PB N="49" REF="50">
following, laughed mo&s;t indelicately in her face; and as I appeared little le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed&mdash;Poor Mi&s;s Seymour! cried he half ironically, tapping me familiarly on the back, Mr. Roat&s;ley I am certain will agree with me that <HI>your</HI> complexion requires no foreign aid, &s;o pray don't blu&s;h &s;o very deep:&mdash;which piece of ad|vice you may &s;uppo&s;e was not much cal|culated to enable me to profit from it.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley finding his pre&s;ence ra|ther augmented the awkwardne&s;s of Fan|ny's &s;ituation, &s;uddenly wi&s;hed us good morning and departed abruptly.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action was in it&s;elf trifling, had it not &s;hewn the family with whom we re&s;ide in a vulgar and ab&s;urd point of view; and the affair of the parcel could have excited neither curio&s;ity nor &s;u&s;pi|cion, had not Mrs. Hindon be&s;towed an importance on it by her ill-judged rail|lery, &s;ufficient to convince Mr. Roat&s;ley that &s;omething "more was meant than
<PB N="50" REF="51">
met the ear." However, except in hav|ing given poor Fanny &s;ome unea&s;y mo|ments, it was of little con&s;equence, as &s;he has at length con&s;ented that Friday &s;hall unite her with Mr. Howard; and imme|diately after the ceremony, at which on|ly Mi&s;s Par&s;ons and this family are to be pre&s;ent, we &s;et off for Hubert Hill; which being &s;eventy five miles from town, we &s;hall not reach till the &s;econd evening.</P>
<P>But tell me, my Sophia, how &s;hall I account for Roat&s;ley's behaviour during our tete a tete this morning? To &s;up|po&s;e him entirely ignorant of an affair which mu&s;t have naturally and unavoid|ably occa&s;ioned &s;ome di&s;turbance, and no &s;mall degree of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in his fa|mily, is to imagine what is not only im|probable, but I own almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. Have I not rea&s;on then to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the inflexible pride, (alas, it is a fa|mily failing!) which his conduct too plainly indicates: &s;till perhaps retaining
<PB N="51" REF="52">
the embers of that trifling partiality he &s;eemed once di&s;po&s;ed to feel for me, yet proudly a&s;hamed, or weakly afraid to venture on a &s;tep his family unju&s;tly pro|hibits, he &s;eeks my company and con|ver&s;ation under the pretended veil of ig|norance. But under a pretence &s;o &s;hal|low, never &s;hall he receive the &s;hadow of my notice, never &s;hall I countenance that per&s;on as my friend, who di&s;dains to acknowledge he is allied to me.</P>
<P>Yet, my dear, how impo&s;&s;ible is it to &s;ee Mr. Roat&s;ley and to retain di&s;plea|&s;ure. In vain I call offended dignity and wounded pride to the aid of my indigna|tion. He is ab&s;ent, and I blame him; but when pre&s;ent, to pre&s;erve even a cold re&s;erve, proves the utmo&s;t exertion of my re&s;olution.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>MARCH 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW infinitely in&s;inuating is this proud cou&s;in of our's. I become every hour more afraid of my&s;elf, yet every moment exhau&s;ts my imagination with efforts to di&s;cover indulgent motives for a conduct which rea&s;on and feeling equal|ly condemn.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon having a&s;ked the favor of his company to her a&s;&s;embly la&s;t night, I was not &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him en|ter: for I confe&s;s I expected he would profit from her invitation, tho' at the time he had hinted &s;omething of a prior engagement, which he &s;aid in all proba|bility
<PB N="53" REF="54">
would prevent him. But never was I &s;o much &s;truck, &s;o much con|founded by his appearance. How in|conceivably &s;uperior did he look to every one of his own &s;ex who was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>There is an air of dignity, I had almo&s;t &s;aid of grandeur, in his figure, equally the re&s;ult of the mo&s;t elegant &s;ymmetry of form and the mo&s;t lively penetration and intelligence of countenance, which to a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver might, I &s;hould ima|gine, at fir&s;t &s;ight wear the a&s;pect of <HI>hauteur,</HI> did not the amiable &s;oftne&s;s of his addre&s;s entirely contradict that idea; and I make no doubt but this contra&s;t may augment the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which every one on the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance &s;eems inclined to feel for him; for all mu&s;t be delighted to perceive that per&s;on who appears, tho' merely from the grace|ful &s;uperiority of his height, to look down on others, de&s;cend on conver&s;ing with them into the gentle&s;t and lea&s;t a&s;&s;uming equality.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">The apartments were filled with com|pany before he arrived; and being &s;ur|rounded by a group of young people at one end of the room, he did not imme|diately di&s;tingui&s;h me.</P>
<P>Shall I confe&s;s that I felt impatient on finding my&s;elf unnoticed, and hurt at per|ceiving that Mrs. Hindon, on his en|trance, detained him in conver&s;ation a con&s;iderable time. I found &s;ome con&s;o|lation, however, in ob&s;erving that he &s;eemed to give her his attention with con&s;traint, and that he often ca&s;t his eyes with anxiety around, as if but little intere&s;ted in what he heard.</P>
<P>During this interval Mi&s;s Farnford and another young lady detained me in an in&s;ipid chit chat, while both my eyes and mind wandered to another &s;ubject. Having &s;oon di&s;covered him however, he in&s;tantly engaged their admiration, and attracted their whole attention.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">Who's that, pray, Mi&s;s Pier&s;on? ex|claimed Mi&s;s Farnford.</P>
<P>It is the hand&s;ome Mr. Roat&s;ley. I'm &s;ure you mu&s;t have heard of him, re|turned the other.</P>
<P>He is ab&s;olutely the hand&s;ome&s;t crea|ture I ever beheld. Pray is he a man of fortune?</P>
<P>Lord, cried the friend, don't you know that he is brother to Lord Linro&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of heaven knows how many thou&s;ands a year. He is ju&s;t returned from abroad, in con&s;equence of a &s;plen|did inheritance left him by an uncle in Ireland; and all the world &s;ays that he is amazingly clever, accompli&s;hed and agreeable; indeed he has all the appear|ance of it, for he is a&s;toni&s;hingly hand|&s;ome.</P>
<P>I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e then he a'nt married, &s;ince he is &s;o lately come home?</P>
<P>No, but ju&s;t on the verge of being &s;o. The wedding cloaths and equipages are
<PB N="56" REF="57">
all be&s;poke, and I'm told his marriage is to take place immediately.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia! don't you feel for me at this moment. My &s;en&s;ations were un|utterable. I felt as if my blood was con|gealed within my veins, and every pul&s;e had refu&s;ed any longer to perform it's function. I had not courage &s;ufficient to a&s;k Mi&s;s Pier&s;on what authority &s;he had for this unlook'd-for information; but my companions, un&s;u&s;picious of my agi|tations, went on with their conver&s;ation in a half whi&s;per, and Mi&s;s Farnford's curio&s;ity &s;oon &s;atisfied mine.</P>
<P>But who pray is the happy woman? cried &s;he gayly.</P>
<P>Lord Mortonbury's daughter, Lady Elizabeth Sedley. She is a piece of per|fection by all accounts. Nobody before was ever &s;o accompli&s;hed. She has all &s;orts of languages&mdash;mu&s;ic, painting, nay poetry too, at her finger's ends; then &s;he is reckoned a prodigious fine woman,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
and dances divinely. Be&s;ides all this, &s;he has a va&s;t fortune, being an only child; &s;o that &s;he is e&s;teemed the fir&s;t match almo&s;t in England; and they &s;ay that her father and Lord Belmont, Mr. Roat&s;ley's grandfather, have all along de&s;igned them for each other, even from their infancy.</P>
<P>Well, that's &s;o odd in old people, re|turned Mi&s;s Farnford. I'm &s;ure if papa was to do &s;o by me, I &s;hould hate my hu&s;band horridly, were he ever &s;o hand|&s;ome.</P>
<P>That is far from being the ca&s;e with Lady Elizabeth; for it &s;eems &s;he is va&s;tly in love with him, and indeed no wonder, for I &s;u&s;pect in her &s;ituation you would not carry your love of contradiction quite &s;o far.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Pier&s;on's conver&s;ation was &s;ud|denly interrupted by Mr. Roat&s;ley's ap|proach; who having ju&s;t at this moment di&s;covered me, came forward in the
<PB N="58" REF="59">
height of my perturbation, with a &s;mile which was &s;uddenly on regarding me converted into a look of apprehen&s;ion and anxiety. The intelligence to which I had ju&s;t been li&s;tening, could not fail to give me the mo&s;t unea&s;y emotions, and the mortification attending this &s;ecret confe&s;&s;ion, wounded me no le&s;s. What? cried I to my&s;elf, have I been all this while weakly allowing an attachment to &s;teal on my heart, which can neither be excu&s;ed by rea&s;on nor principle? Why do I envy another that happine&s;s which I never had the &s;lighte&s;t grounds for be|lieving would ever prove mine? and why &s;hould I feel my&s;elf &s;o unaccountably in|tere&s;ted in the fate of a man, of who&s;e pride and inflexibility, &s;pite of his in&s;inu|ating exterior, I have &s;uch glaring proofs?</P>
<P>The&s;e interrogations, tho' meant to rou&s;e me from my too &s;u&s;ceptible weak|ne&s;s, had by no means the de&s;ired effect;
<PB N="59" REF="60">
and &s;carcely had Mr. Roat&s;ley begun the u&s;ual enquiries after my health, when he added&mdash;I am afraid, Mi&s;s Seymour, your countenance replies too plainly to my que&s;tion. I am afraid you find your|&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed. Perhaps the heat of the room affects you? W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll you allow me the honour of conducting you to the other, where you will have more air, I imagine. Hardly able to reply, I al|lowed him to lead me away tacitly con|firming his conjecture, partly from the effects of an unconquerable embarra&s;&s;|ment which &s;eized me at that in&s;tant, and partly with the view of concealing my agitation from my two companions, of who&s;e &s;u&s;picions I was apprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Farnford however, the in&s;tant &s;he &s;aw me addre&s;&s;ed by a young man of &s;o elegant an appearance, contrived to pin her&s;elf to me for the re&s;t of the even|ing, in hopes of improving this acciden|tal meeting into an acquaintance; and
<PB N="60" REF="61">
made &s;o many attempts to attract his no|tice and engage him in conver&s;ation, that I really blu&s;hed for the forward and child|i&s;h coquetry of her behaviour; particu|larly as from &s;eeing her con&s;tantly by my &s;ide, or hanging on my arm, he mu&s;t have concluded her one of my mo&s;t inti|mate friends; and tho' he an&s;wered her with civility, and the mo&s;t &s;crupulous good breeding, he &s;eemed by no means charmed with her &s;tile of manners.</P>
<P>She was &s;o much delighted with him however, that I was in continual pain le&s;t he &s;hould overhear her expre&s;&s;ions of admiration&mdash;a matter which gave her very little concern. Pray don't you think this Mr. Roat&s;ley the fine&s;t young man you ever beheld in your life? &s;aid &s;he at length, when he had turned for a mo|ment to &s;peak with Mrs. Hindon.</P>
<P>Yes, he is hand&s;ome, &s;aid I, with an affected air of indifference. At lea&s;t I believe he is thought &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">Thought &s;o! repeated &s;he; Lord but don't you think &s;o. I never &s;aw any per&s;on have &s;o much the look of a man of fa&s;hion. But he is ju&s;t going to be married.</P>
<P>Is he, &s;aid I, faintly.</P>
<P>Yes indeed, and the lady is &s;o in love with him as never any body was before. Indeed I don't wonder at that circum|&s;tance in the lea&s;t. But pray don't you think it is too much to be Mr. Roat&s;ley and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;uch prodigious wealth at once? Don't you think &s;o?</P>
<P>Yes, perhaps;&mdash;oh no, not at all, re|turned I with an emotion to which only Mi&s;s Farnford could have been blind; but eager to talk, &s;he perceived not my perplexity, or attributed it to my late indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>But pray tell me, how did you become &s;o well acquainted with him?</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed over in the &s;ame packet boat from Calais.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">Did you indeed. I wi&s;h I had made one of the party. I dare &s;ay it mu&s;t have been a very agreeable one.</P>
<P>Yes, plea&s;ant enough, &s;aid I, quite fatigued with giving attention to a train of que&s;tions &s;o little intere&s;ting, while my thoughts were entirely occupied with a &s;ubject that proved, alas! too much &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley again joining us, pre|vented her proceeding; and Lady Farn|ford's carriage being announced, Mi&s;s was &s;ummoned &s;oon after to attend her mother. Being then relieved from the frivolous interruption of our companion, wo entered into a conver&s;ation, the life and &s;pirit of which were maintained &s;olely by his own efforts; for though I exerted my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, a weight un&s;peakable oppre&s;&s;ed my &s;pirits, and wholly dampt the &s;atisfaction this even|ing would have otherwi&s;e afforded.</P>
<P>Yet I own his behaviour puzzled and
<PB N="63" REF="64">
a&s;toni&s;hed me. Had you witne&s;&s;ed what pa&s;&s;ed during this evening, Sophia; had you beheld the uncon&s;cious ea&s;e with which he conver&s;ed, you never could have &s;u&s;pected that any de&s;ire of conceal|ment lay upon his mind. All &s;eemed open, &s;incere, and unre&s;erved. He ap|parently wi&s;hed me to confe&s;s many little circum&s;tances relating to our life abroad, and even pre&s;umed to hint at enquiries re&s;pecting my father and our abode in Languedoc, tho' with a politene&s;s quite di&s;tinct from impertinent inqui&s;itivene&s;s, and with which, in a &s;tranger, I might have been gratified, &s;uppo&s;ing them the re&s;ult of intere&s;t in my concerns; but which in my cou&s;in I could only &s;u&s;pect to be the con&s;equence of an imperfect information that had excited his curio|&s;ity. The&s;e are conclu&s;ions, however, which did not till afterwards occur. At the time, I could think of nothing but the intelligence that had ju&s;t been com|municated
<PB N="64" REF="65">
to me, and the de&s;truction of a thou&s;and airy dreams which had made the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Oh! my Sophia! however you may and mu&s;t condemn, do not de&s;pi&s;e me for the weakne&s;s which every line of my journal di&s;plays. Good heavens! were any eyes but yours to &s;ee my writing! The very idea makes me tremble. But to unburthen my mind to you, by di&s;|clo&s;ing my inquietudes, is the only &s;o|lace of my exi&s;tence. When I reflect how unre&s;erved, how perfectly free from concealment or re&s;traint, are my com|munications, I can &s;carce conceive how I po&s;&s;e&s;s re&s;olution to tran&s;mit them to writing. Indeed had not an early habit of confidence familiari&s;ed me to the idea of laying open my heart upon paper, I &s;hould never have found courage to ri&s;k the hazards of &s;o long a journey as they mu&s;t take before they reach your hands.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley declined joining any of
<PB N="65" REF="66">
the card parties, tho' &s;trongly &s;olicited by Mrs. Hindon; and Fanny being en|gaged at the commerce table, he gave to me his whole attention. He enquired what were my engagements in public, and hoped to have the plea&s;ure of meet|ing me either at Ranelagh next evening, or at the Opera on Saturday: but I &s;aid, that on my &s;i&s;ter's account I &s;hould not have it in my power to vi&s;it any public place till her affairs were finally &s;ettled; and that immediately after it, I &s;hould accompany her to the country.</P>
<P>What? &s;aid he with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, at this unpropitious &s;ea&s;on do you think of leaving town? I hope, however, your &s;tay will be &s;hort? The country can have no attractions at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I have no thoughts of returning again to town, an&s;wered I with a melancholy I could not wholly repre&s;s. A thou&s;and rea&s;ons con&s;pire to make me wi&s;h my&s;elf &s;ettled in the country, tho' we were
<PB N="66" REF="67">
blocked up with &s;now and enjoyed not the &s;ociety of a &s;ingle individual out of our own little family circle for months to come.</P>
<P>That is a very &s;ingular ta&s;te at your time of life, &s;aid he. That Mi&s;s Sey|mour &s;hould incline to &s;eclude her&s;elf in retirement is not merely cruel, but I had almo&s;t &s;aid, unnatural. Shall I not even have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you at the Opera before you go?</P>
<P>I an&s;wered I was afraid not, as we were to &s;et off on Friday. At this moment Mrs. Hindon approaching, reque&s;ted that he would favour her with his com|pany to &s;upper together with a &s;mall party who had been &s;elected.</P>
<P>To this he in&s;tantly con&s;ented. On &s;eating our&s;elves at table, tho' he made an attempt to get by me, I was placed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, as Mrs. Hindon, out of re&s;pect, a&s;ked him to &s;eat him&s;elf at the upper end, at her right hand, and
<PB N="67" REF="68">
entertained him in a very earne&s;t half-whi&s;per during the repa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of her imprudence, I was &s;eized with apprehen&s;ion le&s;t we and our &s;ituation were the topics on which &s;he had cho&s;en to expatiate; which, from her extreme neglect of delicacy and entire di&s;regard to propriety, was not improba|ble, and mu&s;t have involved us in the &s;e|vere&s;t mortification. I was &s;eriou&s;ly mi|&s;erable from the in&s;tant this &s;u&s;picion oc|curred; and began even to dread that &s;he had been &s;oliciting his aid or plead|ing our cau&s;e;&mdash;an idea that tormented me in the cruelle&s;t manner; for &s;he often glanced her eye on Fanny and on me, and led Mr. Roat&s;ley to regard us in a &s;imilar manner. I am now happily re|lieved however from the&s;e fears; for when I afterwards &s;ounded her on the &s;ubject, &s;he did not betray by the &s;lighte&s;t hint having acted &s;o imprudently, nor
<PB N="68" REF="69">
could I gather from her di&s;cour&s;e any circum&s;tances to alarm me.</P>
<P>After &s;upper I was a&s;ked to &s;ing. Mr. Roat&s;ley is pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic, and confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a performer on &s;everal in&s;truments. This you may be|lieve did not dimini&s;h my natural timi|dity; but the intreaties of the company were &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, and tho&s;e of Mr. and Mrs. Hindon &s;o importunate, that I was con&s;trained to comply, and acquitted my&s;elf indeed very ill.</P>
<P>My &s;pirits, low and oppre&s;&s;ed, made the little &s;ong of "Ah! my charmante Loui&s;e" affect me almo&s;t to tears while I &s;ung. How many painful recollections did it bring to my mind, when my So|phia and my&s;elf received our in&s;tructions together in that delightful accompli&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>I &s;lept very ill la&s;t night. Confound|ed by a variety of conjectures, I knew not which implicitly to credit. From one
<PB N="69" REF="70">
&s;ource of anxiety however I con&s;idered it was in my power to be relieved, and any certainty was preferable to my pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pen&s;e: be&s;ides, to matrimonial intel|ligence entire belief is not always to be given; and as Roat&s;ley ob&s;erves, to what we dread we are mo&s;t liable to give our confidence; I therefore re&s;olved to pay a morning vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Pier&s;on, to whom I have owed one a con&s;iderable time, but who&s;e acquaintance indeed, till this acci|dent, I had not much inclination to cul|tivate. At pre&s;ent however &s;he is the only channel from whence I can draw in|formation, and her &s;ociety is become in|tere&s;ting. I intended, with all the ap|parent indifference I could a&s;&s;ume, to renew the &s;ubject of her recent intelli|gence, and endeavour to di&s;cover on what grounds &s;he had advanced the fact with &s;uch apparent certainty. She was from home however when I called, and I am ju&s;t returned not a little di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">How unlucky it is that I mu&s;t leave town while I remain in this painful un|certainty. Yet why do I call it &s;o, when but for the delu&s;ions of a too &s;anguine mind I &s;hould not harbour a doubt con|cerning the authenticity of Mi&s;s Pier&s;on's intelligence. I have formed fifty little &s;chemes to meet with her; but not being able to form a pretext for calling again my&s;elf, I intend to make Fanny go in my place to pick up what accounts &s;he can learn re&s;pecting this affair.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>ELEVEN AT NIGHT.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Mi&s;s Pier&s;on has &s;aved me the trou|ble of planning &s;ome little artifice to meet with her, by returning my vi&s;it this very evening in an ea&s;y way, accompanied by Mi&s;s Farnford.</P>
<P>My heart beat &s;everely at their en|trance. How do circum&s;tances, appa|rently
<PB N="71" REF="72">
the mo&s;t trivial, change the face of things. Two girls, who&s;e acquaint|ance but a few days ago, from the frivo|lous though harmle&s;s in&s;ipidity of their conver&s;ation I &s;hould rather have avoided than courted, were now become the ob|jects of my mo&s;t anxious &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, from the eagerne&s;s with which they had before entered on the &s;ubject I now wi&s;hed &s;o much to in|troduce, that they might of them&s;elves lead to it; and one is but too apt to con|clude others in &s;ome mea&s;ure influenced by circum&s;tances that convey intere&s;t and agitation to our own bo&s;oms. Mi&s;s Farn|ford and her friend were &s;truck with Roat&s;ley's elegance, and the intelligence of a wedding, intere&s;ting to all girls, had attracted their curio&s;ity and attention; but after the conjecture relating to jew|els, &s;ettlements, finery, &amp;c. were ad|ju&s;ted, to which &s;uch a topic generally gives birth, the idea in all probability
<PB N="72" REF="73">
occurred to them no more. I was there|fore obliged to touch on it my&s;elf in the manner I imagined lea&s;t liable to &s;u&s;pi|cion. Fortunately the penetration of my companions was not to be dreaded, and &s;till more fortunately Mr. and Mrs. Hin|don were engaged abroad.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation I men|tioned a catalogue of marriages as the news of the day; and tacked Mr. Roat&s;|ley's to the end of my li&s;t, tho' not with|out a glow on my cheek.</P>
<P>O don't you remember it was I who told you of that match, &s;aid Mi&s;s Pier|&s;on, the other night when we were here.</P>
<P>I will not vouch for the authenticity of half my intelligence, &s;aid I; and per|haps little more credit ought to be given to this la&s;t union than to many of the others.</P>
<P>Oh I a&s;k your pardon. I a&s;&s;ure you Mr. Roat&s;ley's marriage is an undoubted fact. But certainly you ought to know

all about it better than any body, for I am told that he is your cou&s;in; tho' I be|lieve I ought to reque&s;t your excu&s;e for mentioning it, as I believe you don't wi&s;h it to be made public.</P>
<P>I never heard of it till the other even|ing, &s;aid I; and now that I recollect, you I believe was my authority.</P>
<P>And that I promi&s;e you is as good as po&s;&s;ible: for Lady Mary Lawrence, who is aunt to Lady Elizabeth Sedley, and who has had the charge of her from her infancy, (Lady Mortonbury having died when her daughter was quite a child,) is extremely intimate with my mother, and has frequently mentioned to her this projected alliance, which &s;he is exceed|ingly eager &s;hould take place, as the young man is a very particular favorite with her, and &s;he de&s;igns I know to pre|&s;ent her niece with a very valuable &s;et of jewels on the occa&s;ion, and they are actu|ally be&s;poke: tho' Lady Mary told my
<PB N="74" REF="75">
mother the affair was not to be concluded till Lord Belmont's return from abroad, (who has been the chief promoter of the match,) and his Lord&s;hip is not expected till autumn; therefore the marriage is not publicly talked of by the relations on either &s;ide, but all the world knows of it for all that.</P>
<P>My doom is then fixed, &s;aid I to my|&s;elf. My authority is undoubted, and all delu&s;ion at an end. Let me not &s;ink however with unpardonable weakne&s;s under the blow. Let me re&s;i&s;t this over|whelming regret with all my fortitude. Had it not been from the foible of a too &s;u&s;ceptible heart, all efforts had been on this account unnece&s;&s;ary. Let me there|fore atone to my own mind by the mo&s;t rigorous exertions for the error I have committed, and let a name &s;o fatal, &s;o intere&s;ting, be mentioned in my journal no more.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections, which in an in&s;tant
<PB N="75" REF="76">
pa&s;&s;ed through my mind, be&s;towed a mo|mentary enthu&s;ia&s;m that enabled me to talk with a compo&s;ure on the &s;ubject for which I applauded my&s;elf not a little.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but Lady Elizabeth will be extremely happy, &s;aid I, for Mr. Roat&s;ley really &s;eems to be an agreeable man.</P>
<P>Oh! extremely clever and agreeable certainly, cried Mi&s;s Farnford, (who had been examining &s;ome work with Fanny above &s;tairs, but who ju&s;t then returned,) and the hand&s;ome&s;t creature I ever be|held. But I think if he is actually go|ing to be married the lady has rea&s;on to be not a little jealous, for if ever I di&s;co|vered a man to be in love in my life, Mr. Roat&s;ley is deeply &s;o with Mi&s;s Seymour.</P>
<P>I blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively, but attempted to laugh it off.</P>
<P>Nay you need not blu&s;h &s;o violently, cried Mi&s;s Pier&s;on, for Mi&s;s Farnford
<PB N="76" REF="77">
did not accu&s;e <HI>you</HI> of being in love with <HI>him.</HI> I give you my word however I made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation. During &s;upper his eyes were never from you; and when you &s;ung, (and really you &s;ung di|vinely,) I never beheld a countenance ex|pre&s;s admiration and delight as his did. He &s;eemed to feel every note.</P>
<P>My confu&s;ion was inexpre&s;&s;ible. Con|&s;cious guilt made me extremely appre|hen&s;ive le&s;t it &s;hould excite the notice and raillery of my two gay companions; and Fanny, in&s;tead of endeavouring to relieve me from my embarra&s;&s;ment, had the roguery to plunge me &s;till deeper in|to difficulties. If mu&s;ic be the food of love, cried &s;he, Mr. Roat&s;ley was proba|bly dreaming of his intended during the &s;ong, and of cour&s;e might be more feel|ingly di&s;po&s;ed to reli&s;h its pathetic charms than if he had been in the &s;ame comfortable &s;tate of indifference with the performer. This &s;he uttered with a mo&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="78">
malicious &s;mile; but fortunately the la|dies were in ha&s;te to pay other vi&s;its, and left us &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Sophia. I &s;hall not write again till the marriage is concluded.</P>

<P>HERE we are, all &s;afe and well; tho' we have had two di&s;mal days for travel|ling, and did not arrive at the end of our journey till late ye&s;terday evening, the roads being rendered almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able by a late very heavy fall of &s;now. We
<PB N="78" REF="79">
found a comfortable, &s;nug man&s;ion, a delightful fire, and an elegant little re|pa&s;t ready to be placed on the table, all of which we enjoyed extremely, after having been frozen &s;o many hours on the road.</P>
<P>Dinner being over, Mr. Howard car|ried us through the different apartments of this ru&s;tic dwelling, which are fitted up with infinite ta&s;te though with a fru|gality adapted to its &s;ize and &s;implicity. None of the rooms are large, but chear|ful in the highe&s;t degree, and having been all newly painted, papered, &amp;c. po&s;&s;e&s;s an air not only of uncommon neat|ne&s;s, but even of elegance, a property which in my opinion con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ymme|try rather than in &s;plendor.</P>
<P>I know you will expect the particulars of the wedding: but neither romance nor incident is to be expected where &s;ix|teen is united to forty. Fanny would allow of no forms, though Mrs. Hindon
<PB N="79" REF="80">
wi&s;hed extremely to detain us a few days, to introduce a little merriment to &s;ea&s;on, as &s;he &s;aid, the &s;olemnity of the affair. But Fanny was inexorable. She would not even con&s;ent to make a bridal ap|pearance; but was dre&s;t &s;imply in a tra|velling dre&s;s, being on the wing for Hu|bert Hill.</P>

<P>This morning being a clear fro&s;t, we walked out for an hour and an half. The country around could not be &s;een to advantage, where every object was co|vered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith &s;now; yet it appeared beau|tiful. The hou&s;e is &s;ituated in the mo&s;t romantic &s;pot I ever beheld; fronting the &s;outh we&s;t, on the gentle &s;lope of a hill which ri&s;es by a very gradual a&s;&s;ent. A noble river, the banks of which are &s;haded with very fine old trees, runs be|low,
<PB N="80" REF="81">
within &s;ight of the windows; and the eminence behind, on which there is a thriving plantation, gives the little man&s;ion a very &s;nug appearance. The garden is an excellent one, and well &s;tored with common fruit trees of the be&s;t kinds, that amply compen&s;ate for the want of tho&s;e luxurious ones to be obtained only through the expen&s;ive aid of a hot hou&s;e. The plea&s;ure ground, tho' of &s;mall extent, is laid out with ad|mirable ta&s;te, and the little inclo&s;ures kept in &s;uch good order, that I think in &s;ummer Hubert Hill mu&s;t be the mo&s;t delightful &s;pot in the world.</P>
<P>I am &s;urprized Mr. Howard &s;poke &s;o faintly in its prai&s;e. But no doubt he wi&s;hed to &s;urprize us in favor of our fu|ture re&s;idence. It is on a very &s;mall &s;cale indeed, and partakes more of an ornamented farm than a country feat; but I think the worthy owner has rea&s;on to be not a little vain of the improvements
<PB N="81" REF="82">
he has him&s;elf effected &s;ince it came into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the death of his father; an event that took place only a few years previous to his acquaintance with our family.</P>
<P>From the period of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to Hubert Hill till that of his leaving Eng|land, an amiable &s;i&s;ter, who died of a con&s;umption at the age of twenty-nine, pre&s;ided at the head of his table; and it is to her ta&s;te and regularity that Fanny owes the comfortable and neat elegance of various conveniences not to be expec|ted in the hou&s;e of a bachelor.</P>

<P>Nothing but continual rain or &s;now, and no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;tirring out of doors. We endeavour, however, to make our|&s;elves the more comfortable within; Fanny, who makes all the bu&s;tle of a

young mi&s;tre&s;s of a family vain of the importance of her new charge, finds con|tinual amu&s;ement and employment in directing all her little hou&s;hold matters, for which &s;he really &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s a talent, tho' I &s;ometimes alledge that her orders are calculated rather to confu&s;e than adju&s;t. Being di&s;plea&s;ed with the furniture of her drawing room, which is a little antique, we have &s;et about a &s;e|rious piece of work in order to fit it up with elegance. We have begun to work chairs and hangings in imitation of na|tural flowers; which, as there is &s;cope given both for ta&s;te and ingenuity, is an agreeable occupation. You know this &s;ort of work is a convent accompli&s;h|ment; by which means Fanny and I are adepts in it. I have likewi&s;e undertaken to cover the walls of the little chearful parlour with land&s;capes, for which many delightful &s;cenes even from its windows furni&s;h ample &s;ubject; &s;o that we are

Mr. Howard, who has a well cho&s;en collec|tion of the works of the be&s;t authors, both French and Engli&s;h, generally reads to us while we &s;it at work. The even|ings we divide with a little mu&s;ic, and our favourite che&s;s, &s;o that they never ap|pear too long, and our life on the whole glides along in a tenor &s;o &s;mooth, ratio|nal and placid, that I hope in a &s;hort time to enjoy it with perfect reli&s;h.

<P>This evening I received a letter from Mrs. Hindon. Oh Sophia into what agita|tion has it not thrown me. Read, my dear, what that officious woman writes.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="84" REF="85">
<HEAD>TO MISS SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>I have been prevented from writing you &s;ooner, my dear Mi&s;s Seymour, by a &s;light fever, which though by no means alarming, proved trouble&s;ome for a few days, and was attended by a headach &s;o &s;evere that an application to my pen has been till this day wholly impracticable; although I have been for this week pa&s;t extremely de&s;irous to inform you of a piece of good fortune, the merit of which I mu&s;t take entirely to my &s;elf. To give you a clear and di&s;tinct idea of the whole affair, I mu&s;t begin by previously ac|quainting you, that perceiving you ad|hered ob&s;tinately to your re&s;olution of at|tempting no further application to your family, a mea&s;ure which I always freely confe&s;&s;ed to you I could not but highly di&s;approve of, I my&s;elf, out of mere friend&s;hip, determined upon a &s;tep, the happy &s;ucce&s;s of which I am convinced
<PB N="85" REF="86">
mu&s;t for once induce you to applaud my management.</P>
<P>As Mr. Roat&s;ley, from his vi&s;its and polite civility, appeared to have taken no part in the family tran&s;actions, I &s;eized an opportunity, the evening he did us the honour of &s;upping with us, to hint at the difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing embar|ra&s;&s;ments in which doubtle&s;s you mu&s;t have found your&s;elves involved, had not the marriage of the one &s;i&s;ter offered an agreeable home for both: but what was my &s;urprize on finding that he li&s;tened to me with all the pity and a&s;toni&s;hment of a man who was wholly unconcerned in the affair; and when, emboldened by the compa&s;&s;ion he te&s;tified, I ventured to tell him what a &s;evere di&s;appointment Lord Belmont's cruel behaviour had proved, he declared he had never been informed of the application, nor could he believe it po&s;&s;ible he &s;aid that an affair &s;o melan|choly and intere&s;ting &s;hould have failed
<PB N="86" REF="87">
of &s;ucce&s;s with his Lord&s;hip, who&s;e heart was open to every call of di&s;tre&s;s and to every &s;entiment of humanity. The&s;e were Mr. Roat&s;ley's very words. De|lighted to find my auditor &s;o much more agreeably di&s;po&s;ed than I could have hoped for, you may believe I delayed not laying hold of this favourable moment to expatiate on the mortifying and &s;evere rever&s;e of &s;ituation which but a very &s;hort time ago had been all at once pre|&s;ented before your eyes, by the cruel re|jection of his Lord&s;hip, who&s;e favour was now become, through the impru|dence of your late guardian, &s;till more e&s;&s;ential. I repre&s;ented, in terms the mo&s;t pathetic and moving, the &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;sful poverty and dependence, to which but &s;o lately it &s;eemed likely you mu&s;t both have been reduced, had not the happy and fortunate event before mentioned in part offered a relief, and I failed not to hint, in a pretty explicit
<PB N="87" REF="88">
manner, how u&s;eful and acceptable, nay how nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome addition to your pre&s;ent finances mu&s;t undoubtedly prove; more e&s;pecially as your future expecta|tions, were they even realized to the ut|mo&s;t of your hopes, would afford but a very &s;canty &s;upport and be &s;carcely ca|pable of be&s;towing the mere nece&s;&s;aries of dre&s;s; while for tho&s;e of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence you was con&s;trained to depend upon the limited income of your brother in law.</P>
<P>Never was man more affected than Mr. Roat&s;ley at this recital, and he ex|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;ympathy in the &s;tronge&s;t terms. We had not however either lei|&s;ure or opportunity for di&s;cu&s;&s;ing matters fully. But he faithfully promi&s;ed to ex|ert his utmo&s;t activity and avail him&s;elf of Lord Belmont's intere&s;t towards con|tributing to place you in a &s;ituation &s;uit|able to your birth and education. So eager was he in the cau&s;e, that he called two different times on the two &s;ucceeding
<PB N="88" REF="89">
days, with the intention no doubt of making further enquiries and to con&s;ult what could be done mo&s;t &s;peedily and ef|fectually for your &s;ervice. I was un|luckily from home both times, but I think you told me you had &s;een him the day before you left town, tho' I perceived he had not cho&s;en as yet to make his good intentions known to you; and on my part, as I doubted not but my ap|plication would turn to good account, I had determined to be &s;ilent on the &s;ub|ject till I could &s;urprize you agreeably with the certainty of your good fortune. The morning after Mr. Roat&s;ley again did me the honour of calling; but we were then all engaged at church on the grand affair. Having been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me by letter the very evening after, and a very pretty letter it is, I give you my word, inform|ing me in the genteele&s;t terms that his endeavours in behalf of my friend had
<PB N="89" REF="90">
been &s;o happily crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, that thro' the intere&s;t of a certain noble|man in power, who was the intimate friend of Lord Belmont, a pen&s;ion of two hundred per annum had been pro|cured for Mi&s;s Seymour, while &s;he re|mained unmarried.</P>
<P>But as I have rea&s;on to imagine, (&s;ays he, for I give you the very words of his letter,) that your amiable young friend labours under pre&s;ent difficulties, will you Madam venture to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in a pious fraud which will engage my warm|e&s;t gratitude and re&s;pect: your friend&s;hip and intimacy in all probability mu&s;t af|ford you a pretext for offering Mi&s;s Sey|mour that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which it may be improper to appear as coming from me. In an&s;wer to this, I immediately wrote Mr. Roat&s;ley that I agreed mo&s;t willingly to his generous &s;cheme, and the day fol|lowing received a bill for two hundred pounds, enclo&s;ed in a letter as expre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="90" REF="91">
of gratitude and acknowledgments as if I had conferred on him the greate&s;t of all favors.</P>
<P>As a boon from &s;o near a relation, pro|bably intended as a di&s;charge in full of all demands upon him&s;elf and his rela|tions, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that even your delicacy, (over refined as I have &s;ome times thought it,) will object to the pre|&s;ent; neither can I prevail with my&s;elf to take the merit of a gift, the magnifi|cence of which, when con&s;idered as mine, mu&s;t undoubtedly have awakened your &s;u&s;picion. Mr. Roat&s;ley made yet ano|ther attempt to vi&s;it me &s;oon after this tran&s;action, but I was confined to my bed, and had it not in my power to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Mi&s;s Seymour! Pray accept Mr. Hindon's be&s;t wi&s;hes and mine, and pre&s;ent the &s;ame to my bro|ther and his fair bride; and believe me</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">
Oh! Sophia! what were my emotions on reading this letter! No words can &s;peak my feelings. Though penetrated with the exertions of my amiable cou&s;in in my favour, how &s;everely was I morti|fied, how deeply wounded, to find my|&s;elf the object of his compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;of his genero&s;ity&mdash;of his pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Oh! how did all the pride of my heart ri&s;e at the humiliating idea.</P>
<P>Why did Mrs. Hindon pre&s;ume to in|terfere, without my knowledge or con|&s;ent, in an affair for which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the requi&s;ites neither of judgment nor delicacy. Proud as &s;he appears of her &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hall for ever regret the bu&s;y officiou&s;ne&s;s which dictated a &s;tep &s;o dreadful to me to think of. Yet I fear I am unju&s;t. The poor woman had cer|tainly no apparent aim but my advantage in this unlucky tran&s;action, and perhaps prejudice alone induces me to &s;u&s;pect it the mere effects of her intermedling di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="92" REF="93">
which derives its highe&s;t grati|fication from prying into the concerns of others, and is delighted to find occupa|tion for its re&s;tle&s;s and frivolous activity.</P>
<P>The letter, at the fir&s;t reading, threw me into agonies. I perceived only the mortifying point of view in which Mrs. Hindon had repre&s;ented me to Roat&s;ley, and that reflection poi&s;oned and wholly embittered the &s;atisfaction which the no|tion of his anxiety and intere&s;t might otherwi&s;e have excited. To paint in co|lours the mo&s;t pitiable and moving, &s;o as to rai&s;e his pity and &s;ympathy, the &s;i|tuation to which we might have been reduced?&mdash;good heavens! can &s;he ima|gine this a circum&s;tance from which I could derive &s;atisfaction? Her repre|&s;entation too was by no means ju&s;t, and had not even the merit of truth to re|commend it: for tho' at pre&s;ent I am con&s;trained to depend upon the limited income of my brother in law, Mr. How|ard
<PB N="93" REF="94">
expects that a very few weeks will in all human probability &s;ee Mr. Ben&s;eley's affairs adju&s;ted, and two thou&s;and pounds at lea&s;t retrieved, for his wife's &s;hare and mine, out of the wreck of our for|tune. From the intere&s;t of my patri|mony, &s;lender as it is, in this retired abode I am certain I &s;hall have not only all my nece&s;&s;ary wants &s;upplied, but po&s;|&s;e&s;s the ability of making &s;uch little u&s;e|ful pre&s;ents to my &s;i&s;ter, as &s;hall &s;ecure to me my independency in my own eyes. But this is a notion which to Mrs. Hin|don mu&s;t appear the mere fiction of a romantic brain. Born an heire&s;s, and accu&s;tomed to derive that vain impor|tance on which her heart is fixed from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth and an o&s;tenta|tious di&s;play of grandeur, &s;he regards opulence as the fir&s;t of human ble&s;&s;ings and its deprivation as the harbinger of the mo&s;t acute mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Of the pen&s;ion I heard with unfeigned
<PB N="94" REF="95">
regret. Shocked at the circum&s;tances which had given birth to the acqui&s;ition, I felt it as a painful weight which de|pre&s;&s;ed my mind, and from which to be free I would have given the world had I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. But having communicated the letter to Mr. Howard, he repre&s;ented it to me in aju&s;ter point of view; tho' in reading it to him&s;elf I ob&s;erved that he blu&s;hed indignant at the unfeeling hints with which the epi&s;tle is inter&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>I ought to con&s;ider, he &s;aid, that the obligation of &s;oliciting this annuity was inferior to the claims, which in my pre|&s;ent &s;ituation ju&s;tice alone, independent of humanity, gave me upon my relations; and that as an acquittal of the great debt owing me from their kindne&s;s and atten|tion, this &s;alary had doubtle&s;s been pro|cured, which was evidently de&s;igned to extingui&s;h all future expectations.</P>
<P>As Mr. Howard perceived however that I was vexed and a&s;hamed, and as
<PB N="95" REF="96">
yet undetermined how to act, delicacy made him forbear any other advice on the &s;ubject than merely that which I had at fir&s;t &s;olicited and which naturally re|&s;ulted from reading the letter; and as my happine&s;s and advantage were the &s;ole ideas that dictated his &s;entiments, he thought the&s;e acquirements would not readily be the production of a mea&s;ure which even in pro&s;pect gave birth to &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s. He therefore concluded, with a feeling peculiar to his di&s;po&s;ition, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that our good &s;i&s;ter's notions of affluence are not the mo&s;t ro|mantic in the world; therefore while &s;he thought &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of pro|curing you what &s;he her&s;elf e&s;teems the chief good in life, and which no doubt be&s;tows many valuable and rational gra|tifications, &s;he &s;crupled not by what means the advantage was gained, tho' a little more delicacy exerted in the tran&s;|action had probably given it a very diffe|rent
<PB N="96" REF="97">
a&s;pect to what it now wears. How|ever &s;he meant all for the be&s;t, tho' it cannot be denied that to talk to her of ea&s;e, comfort, and compleat indepen|dence on forty or fifty pounds a year, is to pre&s;ent different &s;hades of colour be|fore eyes who&s;e organs have been from infancy impaired. Indeed the happy di&s;po&s;ition that gives exi&s;tence to &s;uch &s;entiments, is beyond, infinitely beyond the reach of adver&s;e fortune; and is in it&s;elf a ble&s;&s;ing which no worldly acqui|&s;itions can confer.</P>
<P>By prai&s;e &s;o delicate, Mr. Howard la|boured to convince me, that however I &s;hould determine, his opinion &s;hould fol|low mine; and that if my re&s;olution was to give way to pique, and to reject this &s;eeming compromi&s;e with my family, he on his part &s;hould rather applaud than blame the &s;pirit that induced me to refu&s;e a favor, which, however otherwi&s;e advantageous, overwhelmed me with
<PB N="97" REF="98">
mortification. Yet it was not difficult to di&s;cern, that he might be apt to con&s;i|der my rejection as an ab&s;urdity to which fal&s;e delicacy and offended pride alone gave ri&s;e; and when on the other hand I coolly reflected that my finances were by no means a&s;certained, that it was not quite impo&s;&s;ible amid&s;t the chapter of ac|cidents from which they had already &s;uf|fered &s;everely but that I might really one day become dependent on the worthy Mr. Howard and my &s;i&s;ter, a &s;ituation I could indeed but ill brook, I re&s;olved to conquer my reluctance and yield to ne|ce&s;&s;ity; tho' my heart ro&s;e again&s;t my judgment, and had I been alone I &s;hould have indulged in tears, which indeed were not wholly re&s;trained even in Mr. Howard's pre&s;ence, at &s;ight of the bill.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia! what &s;teps were to be taken here, in this mo&s;t cruel of all cir|cum&s;tances? &mdash;To return it in&s;tantly without doubt. But how conceal from
<PB N="98" REF="99">
the generous donor that I was acquainted from whence it came. Since Mrs. Hin|don could not retain <HI>his</HI> &s;ecret, tho' &s;o powerfully urged and intreated, how could I po&s;&s;ibly flatter my&s;elf that &s;he would pay greater regard to mine. I had no path to pur&s;ue that had not been attempted by him without &s;ucce&s;s; how|ever on &s;ome plan I was obliged &s;uddenly to determine. I therefore &s;at down to my bureau without lo&s;s of time to an&s;wer her letter.</P>
<P>I thanked her in terms warmer than were my feelings, tho' I fear my coldne&s;s will &s;urprize her, for the intere&s;t and trouble &s;he has taken in this bu&s;ine&s;s; but re-enclo&s;ed the bill, which I be&s;ought her to return to the right owner, informing him that even as her gift, I could not po&s;&s;ibly prevail with my&s;elf to accept of it.</P>
<P>I have a&s;ked the favor of Mr. Howard to thank Mr. Roat&s;ley by letter in his
<PB N="99" REF="100">
&s;i&s;ter's name for the intere&s;t he has taken in her concerns. I think I can do no le&s;s. An obligation may wound a proud &s;pirit, but the te&s;timonial of a proper gratitude cannot hurt an ingenuous one.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance, material and intere&s;ting, in Mrs. Hindon's letter, on which I have not yet touched, but which I conjecture will not pa&s;s unnoticed even by you, and as for me, it has em|ployed my thoughts day and night ever &s;ince it reached me: Roat&s;ley, &s;he tells me, appears to have been kept hitherto in utter ignorance with regard to our un|lucky tran&s;actions with his mother, and to be wholly unacquainted with the rejected application to our grandfather. Though how particulars of &s;uch importance in the family &s;hould have been concealed from his knowledge it is impo&s;&s;ible to conjec|ture. There is indeed a my&s;tery in this affair which Mr. Howard, Fanny, and my&s;elf, attempt in vain to unravel. Is
<PB N="100" REF="101">
it too fanciful to imagine that Lady Lin|ro&s;e, fearing the known genero&s;ity of her amiable &s;on's di&s;po&s;ition might lead him to act again&s;t the wi&s;hes of Lord Bel|mont, may have determined on keeping him wholly in ignorance. I am bewil|dered in a variety of imaginary opinions, and not a little &s;ecretly delighted at find|ing my&s;elf enabled to exculpate him from tho&s;e charges of pride and duplicity, which in &s;pite of a too in&s;inuating parti|ality, have &s;ometimes painfully recurred to my mind.</P>
<P>Can it be, my Sophia! that Roat&s;ley has been &s;o long ignorant, and what is equally a&s;toni&s;hing and unaccountable, has been informed from the lips of Mrs. Hindon only, that we are &s;o nearly allied by the ties of blood? Yet what are the&s;e ties? how weak, how in&s;ufficient alone either to produce friend&s;hip or to excite e&s;teem or admiration! The connection is indeed productive of &s;atisfaction,
<PB N="101" REF="102">
merely from the idea that it is a founda|tion for intercour&s;e and a pretext for in|timacy. I think however, even in com|mon politene&s;s, he ought to have ap|peared le&s;s dejected than he did upon the di&s;covery. His &s;ilence and embarra&s;&s;|ment during our la&s;t interview evidently confe&s;s what little &s;atisfaction he derived from the information.</P>
<P>I have been reading Mrs. Hindon's letter once more; and tho' &s;hock'd at the indelicacy too vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;ed in almo&s;t every line, now that I am cool there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in it which do not wholly di&s;plea&s;e me. How feeling, how con&s;i|derate, how noble, has been Roat&s;ley's conduct. His heart is indeed open to every call of di&s;tre&s;s, and to every &s;enti|ment of compa&s;&s;ion. How amiable is his delicacy compared to that of his part|ner in the generous tran&s;action. It pains me not, nay I &s;hould be gratified, to re|ceive an obligation from my cou&s;in, di&s;|tinct
<PB N="102" REF="103">
from the &s;ordid and humiliating con&s;ideration of money matters. The anxiety and trouble therefore which were exerted on this occa&s;ion, dilate my heart and animate my gratitude. I am alone hurt that the repre&s;entations of my offi|cious agent were dictated with &s;o little judgment as to excite his pity, and &s;o little refinement as to mortify my feel|ings. To this was owing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to wound me &s;till more &s;everely by pecuniary favours.</P>
<P>I have received a letter from Mi&s;s Par|&s;ons, who promi&s;ed at parting &s;ome|times to let me hear from her. She tells us that &s;he is now mo&s;t agreeably &s;ettled in that line, for which &s;he regarded her|&s;elf as be&s;t qualified to earn her own in|dependent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and that &s;he is to quit Mrs. Hindon's in a few days, who has been much di&s;plea&s;ed with the ingra|titude of her conduct towards &s;o kind a

relation: the&s;e are the good lady's own words.</P>
<P>The lady with whom &s;he was in terms, held her determination &s;u&s;pended as I told you, on account of &s;ome point on which Mi&s;s Par&s;ons did not an&s;wer her wi&s;hes; but on that de&s;erving young woman's offering her &s;ervices in per&s;on, &s;he was &s;o much plea&s;ed with her ap|pearance, as to wave all deficiencies, and clo&s;ed immediately with her terms. Pray who do you imagine this lady has turned out to be? no other than Lady Linro&s;e her&s;elf: and Mi&s;s Par&s;ons at this moment actually makes one of her family.</P>

<P>I Have been ill and unfit for writing for &s;ome days pa&s;t; and tho' &s;till feeble and dejected, I ha&s;ten to that &s;oothing relief which pouring our anxieties into the bo|&s;om of friend&s;hip ever be&s;tows, even in the mo&s;t ditre&s;sful &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard, rambling over his grounds the other evening as it began to grow du&s;k, perceived on the high road at the foot of the hill, a carriage and four driving with great vehemence, as if de&s;ir|ous of arriving at the end of its journey before night &s;hould render travelling, in
<PB N="105" REF="106">
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the weather, dange|rous as well as uncomfortable. A period however was but too &s;oon put to their career, by a mo&s;t alarming accident: the axle-tree all at once gave way, and the coach was &s;uddenly over&s;et with a vio|lence which made Mr. Howard, who was at no great di&s;tance, tremble for the lives of the unfortunate travellers.</P>
<P>He flew in&s;tantly to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and found they con&s;i&s;ted of a lady and her maid, attended by two footmen on hor&s;eback, who were endeavouring to pull the unlucky Abigail out of the &s;hat|tered equipage. This, with the aid of Mr. Howard, was, tho' with difficulty, effected: but they &s;oon perceived that the &s;ituation of the girl was infinitely le&s;s deplorable than the condition in which they beheld the poor lady, who lay with|out motion at the bottom of the coach, her head and arm cut &s;everely by the
<PB N="106" REF="107">
gla&s;&s;es, her face covered with blood, and apparently dead.</P>
<P>Having lifted her out of the coach, Mr. Howard, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the maid, who forgot her own &s;ufferings in her terror for her lady, wiped the blood from her face, endeavoured to &s;top its effu&s;ions with her handkerchief, plentifully be|&s;prinkled her with water, which a late fall of &s;now abundantly &s;upplied on all &s;ides; and having admini&s;tered the aid of eau de luce, &s;al volatile, &amp;c. the poor lady, to their un&s;peakable joy, at length opened her eyes.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;ufficiently reco|vered, Mr. Howard informed her that his hou&s;e was not above a quarter of a mile from the &s;pot, and that every a&s;&s;i&s;tance could there be &s;peedily procured to alle|viate her own &s;ufferings and tho&s;e of her maid; and be&s;ought her to allow him to help her into his own little carriage, for which he had di&s;patched one of the foot|men
<PB N="107" REF="108">
at the moment of his coming up, and which was now arrived. This con|veyance was by no means &s;uited to the pre&s;ent exigency, being a one hor&s;e chair, the only equipage this family boa&s;ts of. In this, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the attendants, Mr. Howard placed the unfortunate la|dy, and &s;lowly approached the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I have brought you an unexpected gue&s;t, my dear, cried Mr. Howard, as he entered, &s;upporting the feeble unfor|tunate; but would to heaven we had been introduced to the honour of her ac|quaintance in circum&s;tances le&s;s unhappy, for &s;he has met with a mo&s;t alarming ac|cident and is &s;everely hurt.</P>
<P>Fanny received her with that cordial kindne&s;s to which her &s;ituation &s;o ju&s;tly laid claim. The &s;urgeon, who had been &s;ent for from the village adjoining, on examining her brui&s;es declared that one of her arms was di&s;located, and that there was a fracture of one of the &s;mall bones
<PB N="108" REF="109">
near the wri&s;t. The unfortunate lady immediately underwent the nece&s;&s;ary ope|rations; but the groans which her agony excited rendered us incapable of remain|ing near her.</P>
<P>At length however her acute &s;ufferings were over. The operator departed, having enjoined the &s;tricte&s;t attention to quiet and re&s;t, and my &s;i&s;ter and I were again admitted into her apartment to &s;ee every thing prepared by There&s;e, her own maid being unable to attend her. We then returned to the parlour, not a little eager to be made acquainted with the name of our lovely gue&s;t, a point in which we &s;till remained ignorant.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard in&s;tantly gratified our curio&s;ity; having learnt from the &s;ervants that their lady was the Counte&s;s of Au|brey, and that they were on their way to her country re&s;idence in the next county, when this unfortunate accident put a pe|riod for the pre&s;ent to their journey. He
<PB N="109" REF="110">
informed us likewi&s;e that he had &s;ent an expre&s;s to Sir William Meredith, (who&s;e lady was Lady Aubrey's neare&s;t relation, and tenderly attached to her, and who would be mi&s;erable, the girl &s;aid, if ab|&s;ent from her lady at a juncture &s;o cri|tical), acquainting him with this unfor|tunate event, and reque&s;ting that he and Lady Meredith would take up their re|&s;idence at Hubert Hill till all alarm re|&s;pecting Lady Aubrey was at an end.</P>
<P>This accident you may &s;uppo&s;e, by inte|re&s;ting our compa&s;&s;ion &s;o powerfully, had di&s;compo&s;ed us not a little, and wholly interrupted the &s;ocial tranquillity in which our evenings are u&s;ually &s;pent.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard in particular was uncom|monly grave, and te&s;tified an anxiety, which, had not the &s;ingular humanity of his di&s;po&s;ition been well known to me, might have created &s;u&s;picion. I am very apprehen&s;ive, &s;aid he, for the life of La|dy Aubrey. Her delicacy of frame
<PB N="110" REF="111">
&s;eems but ill calculated for &s;u&s;taining an accident of this kind, and too much cau|tion cannot be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence too powerfully ju&s;ti|fied his alarm: about three in the morn|ing I was &s;uddenly awakened by There&s;e, who ha&s;tily drew a&s;ide my curtain. Ah! Mademoi&s;elle! &s;aid &s;he, la pauvre dame e&s;t tres mal.</P>
<P>She then informed me that her Lady|&s;hip had been exce&s;&s;ively unquiet all the night, and &s;o low &s;pirited, that appa|rently worn out by re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s and pain, &s;he at length bur&s;t into tears; and telling There&s;e &s;he could not re&s;t, ordered her to bring a light into her chamber as &s;he found &s;leeping impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The girl entreated her to &s;wallow a few drops in &s;ome water, to which &s;he con|&s;ented; and giving over all thoughts of repo&s;e, &s;he had her curtains drawn a&s;ide, and tried to beguile the tedious hours of midnight by entering into conver&s;ation
<PB N="111" REF="112">
with There&s;e; who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the lo|quacity of her nation, and who, from en|countering few of her equals to whom &s;he can talk, &s;eizes with avidity every opportunity &s;he can lay hold of to in|demnify her&s;elf for the painful penance of &s;ilence, by making repri&s;als upon tho&s;e who under&s;tand her language.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip, &s;he &s;aid, had made ma|ny enquiries about my &s;i&s;ter and me, to who&s;e humanity and ho&s;pitality &s;he often repeated &s;he owed her life; and the girl was in hopes &s;he found her&s;elf &s;omewhat ea&s;ier, when &s;he was &s;eized all at once with a fit &s;o violent and alarming, that There&s;e was obliged to call up her own maid to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and tho' &s;he is now rather more compo&s;ed, continued &s;he, I am afraid Madame's fever is ex|tremely high. She talks very incohe|rently, mutters to her&s;elf in a manner truely frightful, and ju&s;t now in&s;i&s;ts on ri&s;ing and being dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113">This information made me ha&s;tily get up; and unwilling to di&s;turb my &s;i&s;ter, who of late has been rather indi&s;po&s;ed, I threw my wrapping gown over me, and ordering Mr. Rudder, the &s;urgeon, to be in&s;tantly &s;ent for, I &s;tole &s;oftly into Lady Aubrey's apartment, and approaching the bed, where her maid was unwillingly a&s;&s;i&s;ting her to ri&s;e, I enquired how &s;he found her&s;elf; but oh! Sophia! how &s;hall I find words by which to convey to you an idea of the &s;en&s;ations which over|powered me? Is it in language to fur|ni&s;h expre&s;&s;ions adequate to tho&s;e feelings which overwhelmed my &s;en&s;es, when the amiable, the unfortunate Lady Aubrey, with a frantic violence that eluded all op|po&s;ition, &s;uddenly &s;pringing from the bed, threw her&s;elf at my feet, and em|bracing my knees, exclaimed in accents which froze my blood&mdash;oh! my Lord! my beloved Lord Linro&s;e! for the &s;ake of heaven do not frown upon me &s;o ter|ribly.
<PB N="113" REF="114">
Your looks &s;tab me to the &s;oul! you terrify me my Lord!&mdash;oh! have mercy upon me!&mdash;I was dear to you once!&mdash;did you not &s;ay &s;o?&mdash;and I have long, long forgiven you all you have made me endure.</P>
<P>I heard no more, but fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground.</P>
<P>There&s;e and the woman, terrified at the unaccountable &s;cene before them, flew to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and while the one ineffectually admini&s;tered hart&s;horn and other volatile re&s;toratives to me, the other entreated her di&s;tracted lady to &s;uffer her&s;elf to be again undre&s;t and to return to bed: and &s;o quickly does in&s;anity change the object of its intere&s;t and pur|&s;uit, that forgetting the idea which had but a moment before &s;o violently agita|ted her bo&s;om, &s;he allowed her&s;elf to be again put to bed, and yielding to weak|ne&s;s, was for &s;ome time tolerably &s;till and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">Finding in the mean while that I &s;hewed no &s;ymptoms of recovery, The|re&s;e in terror awakened my &s;i&s;ter, who flew half dre&s;&s;ed into the room ju&s;t as I had opened my eyes and began to recol|lect my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>A &s;ea&s;onable flood of tears in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieved the angui&s;h of my feel|ings, and allayed Fanny's apprehen&s;ions of a relap&s;e; and with her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;ummoned &s;trength &s;ufficient to quit Lady Aubrey's chamber, where the &s;ound of her voice repeating in the mo&s;t me|lancholy accents my father's name, and breathing her &s;oft and heart breaking complaints at his cruelty and dete&s;tation, threw me into agonies un&s;peakable.</P>
<P>Fanny, who was yet unacquainted with the cau&s;e of my agitation, and who hav|ing been merely informed that Lady Aubrey was delirious, in her anxiety on my account had not attended to the in|coherencies that fell from her lips, ea|gerly
<PB N="115" REF="116">
poured upon me, the moment we left it, a thou&s;and enquiries re&s;pecting the occa&s;ion of the fit with which I had been &s;eized. I was unable to &s;atisfy her; and felt relieved by the entrance of Mr. Howard, who&s;e countenance informed me that to him at lea&s;t the ta&s;k of di&s;|clo&s;ing it was unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>For heavens &s;ake, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, compo&s;e your&s;elf, cried Mr. Howard. The pain of this affecting incident I might have prevented, had I dreaded or fore&s;een an explanation &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and abrupt: but the apprehen&s;ion of inflict|ing an unnece&s;&s;ary wound deterred me from an information which I was well qualified to have given the in&s;tant Lady Aubrey's name reached my ears.</P>
<P>What information? cried Fanny. You frighten me, tho' without knowing why. I perceive this lady is one of our rela|tions: but why &s;hould the knowledge of that circum&s;tance wound or di&s;tre&s;s us.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">If you will promi&s;e me, my dear, not to be too much affected&mdash;</P>
<P>For heavens &s;ake tell me to what all this preparation tends?</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t going to do &s;o, &s;aid he, tak|ing her hand; and I hope you will not be alarmed when I de&s;ire you to recall to mind an unfortunate lady, who&s;e name frequently occurs in the packet once en|tru&s;ted to my care&mdash;Mi&s;s Mar&s;don.</P>
<P>Good God! is it po&s;&s;ible! Can Lady Aubrey be in fact that mi&s;erable, that ill fated woman: and &s;ubdued by a crowd of melancholy ideas, Fanny melted into tears; but frightened to witne&s;s the &s;till &s;uperior angui&s;h of my feelings, &s;he for|got her own di&s;tre&s;s to &s;oothe mine.</P>
<P>Oh! my deare&s;t Hermione! cried &s;he, do not give way to this agitation. You will di&s;tract me. Con&s;ider, my love, that time mu&s;t have long &s;ince greatly allayed Lady Aubrey's &s;ufferings. Tho&s;e of our dear, dear father, are hap|pily
<PB N="117" REF="118">
lulled to perpetual re&s;t. He is now di&s;engaged from all the pains and &s;orrows of the world, and this accidental rencon|tre ought not too &s;everely to affect us.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ion of alarming her made me exert my&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume a com|po&s;ure to which I could not &s;o &s;peedily attain; but revolving in my mind all the circum&s;tances that had occurred &s;ince Lady Aubrey's arrival, it was not diffi|cult for me to trace the cau&s;e of the me|lancholy delirium with which &s;he had been &s;eized, nor of that &s;udden bur&s;t of grief that &s;o wholly overpowered her the in&s;tant I was pre&s;ented to her &s;ight; and which, tho' it &s;eemed to us the natural con&s;equence of depre&s;&s;ion and unea&s;ine&s;s, had undoubtedly its &s;ource in my re|&s;emblance to my father, which has been ever deemed &s;trikingly remarkable, and which mu&s;t have overwhelmed her, even at the fir&s;t moment, with &s;ome &s;light &s;u&s;|picion of my being in fact one of tho&s;e
<PB N="118" REF="119">
daughters of who&s;e exi&s;tence I can hardly imagine &s;he has remained wholly igno|rant; and her conver&s;ation with the lo|quacious There&s;e, a conver&s;ation po&s;&s;ibly de&s;igned to a&s;certain her doubts, pouring undeniable conviction on her mind at a moment of fatigue, pain, and indi&s;po&s;i|tion, no wonder that &s;uch a conflict of emotions co-operating with her late acci|dent, &s;hould have di&s;ordered her imagi|nation.</P>
<P>Upon interrogating There&s;e more mi|nutely, I find the&s;e conjectures &s;trongly corroborated. Tho' &s;ighs and tears, &s;he &s;ays, often bur&s;t from the unfortunate invalid, her expre&s;&s;ions were di&s;tinct, and to all appearance her rea&s;on clear, till after midnight; when calling There&s;e to the &s;ide of her bed, &s;he enquired into a thou&s;and particulars relating to her two ladies. Were they lately arrived from abroad? in what part of the continent did they u&s;ually re&s;ide? did they give
<PB N="119" REF="120">
into the gaieties of M&mdash;, (within &s;ixty miles of which place There&s;e had told her we lived,) or did we prefer the re|tirement of the country? on all of which There&s;e was &s;ufficiently communicative.</P>
<P>Late in the evening Lady Meredith ar|rived. All this day Lady Aubrey con|tinued in the mo&s;t dangerous way. Her fever &s;eemed rather on the encrea&s;e, tho' already &s;o violent that &s;he had not had one interval of returning recollection, but raved with uncea&s;ing and dreadful incoherency &s;ince the moment of my &s;ud|den appearance.</P>
<P>During this time you may ea&s;ily judge what were my &s;en&s;ations. The weight on my &s;pirits was indeed in&s;upportable. Regarding Lady Aubrey in the light of a woman for whom my beloved parent had &s;uffered &s;o much&mdash;the woman who loved and had endured &s;o much for him&mdash;my heart became attached to her by a &s;trong and irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e of affection, and
<PB N="120" REF="121">
I could not but feel deeply intere&s;ted in a life which was once &s;o dear to him. Anxiety, and a re&s;pect almo&s;t filial, ur|ged me to watch with eager &s;edulity the turn of her fever, and to admini&s;ter with my own hands the pre&s;criptions ordered by the phy&s;icians who were called in to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but wholly overcome by the incoherent ravings of her delirium, no &s;ooner was I &s;eated by her bed &s;ide than my feelings rendered me incapable of remaining in &s;ilence and compo&s;ure, and I was obliged to fly to another apart|ment for the relief of weeping aloud and at liberty.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter and Mr. Howard intreated me to &s;pare my&s;elf the angui&s;h of a &s;cene &s;o dreadful; but when it became in&s;up|portable, I made my e&s;cape, and while I pre&s;erved fortitude &s;ufficient for the ta&s;k, I felt a &s;ecret idea of duty which recompenced me for the pain of my at|tendance.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">Sir William Meredith was prevented from accompanying his lady by a fit of the gout. Her terrors on account of her niece were indeed extreme. She wept violently on alighting, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed hardly re&s;olution &s;ufficient for li&s;tening to the particulars of her accident.</P>
<P>The countenance of the phy&s;ician feel|ingly told how much was to be dreaded, All I can in con&s;cience tell you, Madam, &s;aid Doctor Harding to Lady Meredith, is, that you will not remain long in the mi&s;ery of &s;u&s;pen&s;e. One way or other it mu&s;t &s;oon be decided.</P>
<P>This day, alas! has produced no &s;ymptom in the lea&s;t favorable. Lady Aubrey continues to endure all the re&s;t|le&s;s turbulence of delirium, is in conti|nual motion, &s;hifts an unea&s;y po&s;ture perpetually without finding one that be|&s;tows more relief, and is &s;ometimes obliged to be detained by force from leaving her bed. She talks ince&s;&s;antly; and tho' her
<PB N="122" REF="123">
di&s;cour&s;e is incoherent, it is uniformly pa|thetic, melancholy, and intere&s;ting. She not only recurs often to my father's name, but if I mi&s;take not, even Mr. Ben&s;eley's &s;ome hours ago e&s;caped her.

<P>After a tedious &s;u&s;pen&s;e of ten days, Lady Aubrey's fever, thank Heaven, be|gins to give way to medicine. Doctor Harding this day pronounces his patient in a fair way of recovery. Her recollec|tion is perfectly re&s;tored, the violence of her fever is abated, and &s;he is now &s;en&s;i|ble of her aunt's attendance, who leaves not her chamber either day or night, having a &s;mall field bed placed in the room, wherein &s;he has taken what little

<P>This interval has been a period of real angui&s;h to me. All the horrors of my father's &s;ufferings and misfortunes, this wonderful and unexpected incident has renewed in my mind with augmented poignancy; and that gloomy impre&s;&s;ion which the &s;oothing hand of time, the ha|bit of frequent reflexion, and the con&s;ider|ation of his tran&s;ition, I tru&s;t, to a hap|pier world, had in &s;ome mea&s;ure effaced, this accidental meeting has re&s;tored with redoubled violence, attended if po&s;&s;i|ble with encrea&s;ed depre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard and Fanny having in&s;i&s;t|ed on my relinqui&s;hing an attendance which the pre&s;ence of Lady Meredith rendered unnece&s;&s;ary, and which, igno|rant of the &s;ecret and &s;ingular the that binds my heart to that of the unfortunate Lady Aubrey might be deemed officious by her aunt, I have &s;trictly forborn ever
<PB N="124" REF="125">
&s;ince her arrival to enter the apartment; and &s;o powerfully has my &s;en&s;ibility &s;trengthened by this forbearance, that had my a&s;&s;i&s;tance been required I &s;carce think I could have &s;ummoned re&s;olution &s;ufficient for encountering the hazard of again hearing my father's name pro|nounced in the heart rending accents of the mournful invalid. Even now, that her rea&s;on and recollection, through the mercy of Heaven, are re&s;tored, I look forward with inexpre&s;&s;ible apprehen&s;ion to the idea of once more meeting her eyes. The pang this interview mu&s;t occa&s;ion to her bo&s;om, the pain with which it mu&s;t overwhelm mine even in anticipation, agitates me beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Lady Aubrey is much better. She now merely retains that languor and de|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="125" REF="126">
which indi&s;po&s;ition, independent of dejection, invariably leaves behind as a memento of its power.</P>
<P>Lady Meredith, who is a mo&s;t amia|ble and agreeable woman, now happily delivered from the painful anxiety that oppre&s;&s;ed her, gives us at times, when &s;he can be &s;pared from her attendance on her niece, a good deal of her com|pany, and expre&s;&s;es in the warme&s;t terms her gratitude for our attention to Lady Aubrey.</P>

<P>As yet Lady Aubrey, who is now able to &s;it up, or rather to recline on the &s;o|pha for &s;ome hours every day, has ex|pre&s;&s;ed no de&s;ire for an interview with either my &s;i&s;ter or my&s;elf, and the longer this meeting is delayed the more for|midable it appears. It is but too pro|bable,
<PB N="126" REF="127">
indeed, that &s;he views it with equal apprehen&s;ion, and willingly lays hold of the pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition to defer a conference which mu&s;t be pro|ductive of &s;o much pain and embarra&s;&s;|ment to all parties.</P>
<P>I think it not unlikely, that perceiving the ob&s;curity that is thrown over our &s;i|tuation, the borrowed name we have a&s;|&s;umed, the retirement in which we live, and the total alienation which has taken place between us and my uncle's family, &s;he may be led to conclude our real rank in life a &s;ecret even to our&s;elves, or at lea&s;t may be induced to &s;u&s;pect that the circum&s;tances of our birth are but partially known to us; tho&s;e particulars e&s;pecially in which &s;he her&s;elf is imme|diately concerned, &s;he may naturally conjecture the lea&s;t liable of any to have reached our ears. In this ca&s;e, as all explanation upon our meeting is out of the que&s;tion, part of the awkwardne&s;s of

the &s;cene will be avoided, and I am la|bouring to think of it with a compo&s;ure that &s;hall enable me, when it takes place, to behave with the calm indifference of an unconcerned per&s;on.</P>

<P>La&s;t night Lady Meredith delivered to us a me&s;&s;age from Lady Aubrey, in|timating that her Lady&s;hip had been for &s;ome days pa&s;t beyond mea&s;ure anxi|ous to return us per&s;onally her grateful acknowledgments for that benevolent ho&s;pitality to which &s;he had been &s;o infinitely indebted; but that the weak &s;tate of her nerves rendering her liable to be &s;eized with agitation, and di&s;com|po&s;ed by the mo&s;t trifling occurrences, Lady Meredith had per&s;uaded her into compliance with the injunctions of her phy&s;icians, which were on no account
<PB N="128" REF="129">
to hazard any ri&s;k of being di&s;ordered or di&s;turbed in her pre&s;ent feeble condition; finding her&s;elf now, however, much re|cruited both in &s;trength and &s;pirits, &s;he hoped in a day or two to be well enough to a&s;k the favour of a vi&s;it from us in her dre&s;&s;ing room, and in the mean while recommended her&s;elf, with many kind and polite expre&s;&s;ions, to our good wi&s;hes.</P>

<P>This formidable interview is at la&s;t over. Oh! Sophia! I did not imagine it more formidable than it proved.</P>
<P>This morning Lady Meredith came down to the parlour, for &s;he &s;eldom gra|tifies us with her company till dinner, and reque&s;ted, in Lady Aubrey's name, the favour of my &s;i&s;ter's company and mine above &s;tairs. My heart beat vio|lently
<PB N="129" REF="130">
at this me&s;&s;age. I felt my&s;elf change colour; and involuntarily &s;at down on the fir&s;t chair &s;o evidently di&s;|compo&s;ed, that Lady Meredith concluded I was ill, and &s;aid with much kindne&s;s, 'tis fortunate, my dear Mi&s;s Seymour, that I would not be prevailed with to accept of your mo&s;t obliging offer of &s;haring my fatigue and attendance upon my niece, for I &s;hould have undoubtedly &s;u&s;pected that you had &s;uffered for your humanity. I am certain you are indi&s;|po&s;ed. Pray allow me to feel your pul&s;e; for you mu&s;t know I am reckoned an able phy&s;ician by the poor people around our &s;eat in the country. You are feveri&s;h I am convinced, and mu&s;t nur&s;e your&s;elf for a day or two.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured her I was perfectly well; but &s;he would not give immediate credit to my a&s;&s;ertion, and entreated my &s;i&s;ter to prevail with me to allow of the phy&s;ician's attendance. Finding however that we
<PB N="130" REF="131">
both made light of the propo&s;al, &s;he left us to prepare her niece for our appear|ance, who was &s;o feeble and exhau&s;ted, that a trifle &s;he &s;aid di&s;compo&s;ed her &s;pirits, and threw her into a tremor.</P>
<P>Alas! Sophia, this interview, though a circum&s;tance of no moment in the eyes of Lady Meredith, was by no means a trifle to the unfortunate Lady Aubrey; and &s;o wholly did the pro&s;pect of it over|power her feelings, that her aunt re|turned to us in a few minutes with an apology and reque&s;t that we would be &s;o kind as to defer our vi&s;it till the even|ing, as &s;he found her&s;elf languid and oppre&s;&s;ed, and meant to lie down for an hour or two.</P>
<P>I felt relieved by this &s;hort re&s;pite; and in the mean while endeavoured to prepare my&s;elf for the approaching pe|riod with a compo&s;ure that might wholly confute any &s;u&s;picions &s;he might enter|tain of my being con&s;cious of the inte|re&s;ting
<PB N="131" REF="132">
and melancholy events that form a connexion &s;o &s;ingular between us. As for my &s;i&s;ter, her emotions, naturally le&s;s uncontroulable, at lea&s;t after the fir&s;t moments of agitation, I was under no apprehen&s;ion that &s;he would betray her&s;elf; and by pre&s;erving if po&s;&s;ible an air of &s;erenity my&s;elf, I hoped to render this meeting le&s;s affecting to Lady Au|brey, who by that means would be &s;pared the painful reflections which our mutual perturbation might otherwi&s;e occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the evening, Lady Meredith re|turned again into the parlour. I am come once more, &s;aid &s;he, to a&s;k the favour of your company in Lady Au|brey's dre&s;&s;ing room. She is by no means well to-day; and I am &s;o apprehen&s;ive of a relap&s;e, that I would have per&s;uaded her to defer your vi&s;it till to-morrow, and go to re&s;t early; but her heart is &s;o bent upon the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, that I fear oppo&s;ition would prove more
<PB N="132" REF="133">
hurtful than the flutter of &s;pirits which the &s;ight of a new face in the pre&s;ent weak &s;tate of her nerves may occa&s;ion. I however &s;hall remain below, and enjoy a tete a tete with Mr. Howard, that we may not prove too many at once for her.</P>
<P>We accordingly went up &s;tairs. The dre&s;&s;ing room windows had been dark|ened with blinds, under pretence that the light was offen&s;ive, but doubtle&s;s with the intention of concealing an emo|tion for which the inadequate allegation of debilitude and recent indi&s;po&s;ition only could be given. Lovely even in &s;ickne&s;s, &s;he reclined on a &s;opha; from which, the moment we appeared, &s;he made a feeble attempt to ri&s;e; but find|ing her&s;elf incapable of effecting it, &s;he fell back in evident di&s;compo&s;ure, and holding out a hand to each, bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>All my re&s;olution for&s;ook me at that moment. Beholding her the victim of
<PB N="133" REF="134">
tho&s;e calamities which had wholly embit|tered the declining days of my father&mdash; calamities which &s;he &s;till lived to de|plore, and evidently felt at that in&s;tant with all the agony of recent and bitter di&s;appointment, my heart melted with &s;ympathetic &s;orrow, and forgetting the compo&s;ure I had laboured to obtain, I pre&s;&s;ed her offered hand to my lips with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervour which told as plainly as words could have done that I partook in the griefs that oppre&s;&s;ed her di&s;con&s;olate bo&s;om. This language was indeed too expre&s;&s;ive not to be in&s;tantly comprehended, for rai&s;ing her&s;elf by a &s;udden effort, &s;he cla&s;ped me in her arms, and &s;upporting her head on my &s;houlder, &s;obbed aloud..</P>
<P>Terrified at the violence of her emo|tions, I would have broke from her to have called Lady Meredith; but redou|bling her care&s;&s;es, do not leave me, cried &s;he the moment &s;he could articulate&mdash;
<PB N="134" REF="135">
tears are habitual to me, and tho&s;e I &s;hed at this moment are produced by &s;en&s;ations which have not often, alas! found entrance into my heart. Let not this agitation frighten you, added &s;he. It's vehemence will in time abate. The Almighty, I tru&s;t, &s;ends you to me for my con&s;olation and &s;upport. She was unable to proceed; but di&s;engaging her|&s;elf from my embraces, &s;he &s;tretched out her arms to Fanny, who flew into them drowned in tears.</P>
<P>For heavens &s;ake, deare&s;t Madam, cried &s;he, for I was unable to &s;peak, endeavour to compo&s;e your&s;elf; for your own &s;ake and for ours try to be calm. Many, many days of happine&s;s are yet I hope in &s;tore for us all. Your friend|&s;hip and affection is alone able to con&s;ti|tute our felicity; and it will be the de|light of our lives if you will honour us &s;o far as to flatter us with the hopes of being enabled, from the &s;olicitude of the
<PB N="135" REF="136">
tendere&s;t regard and mo&s;t filial affection, in &s;ome &s;light degree to contribute to your's.</P>
<P>Alarmed for the con&s;equences of this &s;cene, and afraid le&s;t the frankne&s;s of Fanny's di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould lead her in the height of her emotions to touch on par|ticulars much too delicate for the pre&s;ent moment, I ran to the door to call Lady Meredith, who&s;e pre&s;ence I imagined would put a period to a conver&s;ation that was about to become much too intere&s;ting to all parties, and which in the precarious &s;tate of Lady Aubrey's health might prove exceedingly hurtful to a frame &s;o infinitely delicate; but perceiving my intention, &s;he entreated me to &s;it down by her, and having &s;wal|lowed &s;ome drops in water, &s;he became &s;omewhat more compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t in heaven, &s;aid &s;he, again tak|ing my hand and obliging Fanny to &s;eat her&s;elf upon the &s;opha, that there are
<PB N="136" REF="137">
days of returning peace yet in &s;tore for me, &s;ince the Almighty has been plea&s;ed in his gracious providence to vouch&s;afe me, by means &s;o unexpected and extra|ordinary, the gratification of that eager wi&s;h, in which has been centered all my hopes and expectations of &s;atisfaction on this &s;ide the grave; for know, my ami|able young friends, continued &s;he in ac|cents interrupted by tears, that you have been ever &s;ince&mdash;(her voice failed her,) ever &s;ince my return to England, the &s;ubject of my thoughts&mdash;of my very dreams&mdash;and the uncea&s;ing &s;ource of my anxious but ineffectual pur&s;uit. Poor Mr. Ben&s;eley! He was the firm and un|alterable friend of both. His &s;teady and inflexible attachment no circum&s;tances could change, no rever&s;es could &s;hake, while he remained convinced, continued &s;he cla&s;ping her hands together with an energy the mo&s;t affecting, that there &s;till lay concealed within the &s;ecret rece&s;s of
<PB N="137" REF="138">
the heart, a hidden and ob&s;cured, yet fervent &s;entiment of virtue, which called for the &s;oothing hand of friend&s;hip to guard it from di&s;traction and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>You will not wonder, Sophia, that the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech, by over|whelming me with the complicated &s;en|&s;ations of a&s;toni&s;hment, admiration, &s;or|row, and delight, &s;hould wholly over|power my feelings. Utterance was de|nied me: yet words, had I been able to command them, could have but feebly expre&s;&s;ed the tumult of contending emo|tions that agitated my bo&s;om. Throw|ing my&s;elf on my knees before the in|jured Lady Aubrey, I di&s;&s;olved into tears; and while I ki&s;&s;ed her hand and pre&s;&s;ed it to my heart, my looks and my di&s;tre&s;s told her how much I venerated and admired her. Oh, Sophia! had you beheld the lovely unfortunate at that moment, you mu&s;t have adored her.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">She embraced me with the tendere&s;t emotion; and I then reiterated my in|treaties that &s;he would allow us to leave her. But while &s;he detained me feebly by the hand, &s;he reque&s;ted Fanny to re|move the blinds, which now almo&s;t wholly ob&s;cured the declining rays of the evening, and fixing her eyes &s;tea|dily for an in&s;tant on my face, tears again began to flow, and &s;ighing with an expre&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t mournful, &s;he bade us good night. You may conclude that my &s;i&s;ter and I could not &s;peedily recover the appearance of compo&s;ure. Yet af|fecting as this interview had proved, a mixture of &s;omewhat &s;oothing and con|&s;olatory has in&s;inuated it&s;elf amid&s;t the bitterne&s;s of more poignant &s;en&s;ations. By a wonderful interpo&s;ition of Provi|dence, we had been introduced to the knowledge of one of the mo&s;t amiable of her &s;ex, who not only felt inclined to accord us her friend&s;hip and affection,
<PB N="139" REF="140">
but who was already our friend, who re|turned with fervor the warm attachment our hearts had imbibed almo&s;t the fir&s;t moment that &s;he was pre&s;ented to our view, and the bitter recollection of who&s;e pa&s;t calamities our a&s;&s;iduous attention might prove the fortunate means of &s;oothing into tranquillity. The&s;e reflec|tions were of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing nature, and grateful to our hearts; yet were they but ill calculated for wiping the tears from our eyes: on the contrary, by melting every &s;en&s;ation into tenderne&s;s we were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted with weeping, when Mr. Howard came to &s;eek us in my dre&s;&s;ing room, where we had taken refuge in hopes of acquiring that com|po&s;ure which our tete a tete had ba|ni&s;hed &s;till further than ever from our minds.</P>
<P>He ki&s;&s;ed a hand of each, and telling us that &s;upper waited, and that Lady Meredith was already in the parlour, we
<PB N="140" REF="141">
tried to a&s;&s;umed &s;miling faces, and defer|ring any account of our affecting inter|view till a more convenient opportunity, accompanied him down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>On our entrance, and during &s;upper, Lady Meredith's countenance betrayed an expre&s;&s;ion of grave re&s;erve &s;o different from the frank and open familiarity of manner which &s;ince the relief of her anxiety had &s;eemed the characteri&s;tic of her mind, that I in&s;tantly perceived &s;he had been but recently informed of par|ticulars, which probably the agitation of Lady Aubrey's &s;pirits had di&s;covered to her only an hour or two before. Painful as it was both to witne&s;s this change and to &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e, I made large allow|ances for the prejudice which induced her to regard us with repugnance. That Lady Meredith &s;hould behold with di&s;|gu&s;t, the offspring of him who&s;e name in all probability &s;he merely knew as the &s;ource of mi&s;ery to her beloved niece,
<PB N="141" REF="142">
and with who&s;e &s;ub&s;equent agonies of re|mor&s;e &s;he may be wholly ignorant, is not &s;urpri&s;ing, when &s;uch con&s;iderations have had power to outweigh in the &s;cale of paternal affection every motive of huma|nity, compa&s;&s;ion, and even duty. Yes, Sophia, even duty: for rigid as Lord Belmont's &s;en&s;e of integrity is reported to be, in regard to us, a mi&s;taken notion of honour &s;ways his conduct. It is for minds like the angelic Lady Aubrey's only to prove &s;uperior to &s;uch &s;entiments, to wave per&s;onal injuries, to di&s;card pri|vate re&s;entment, and to forget her own feelings and &s;ufferings in her pity and affection for the penitent author of her calamities.</P>
<P>As Mr. Howard during &s;upper had conver&s;ed on indifferent &s;ubjects, and Lady Meredith with an air of unu&s;ual ceremony &s;eemed determined to follow his lead, the mortifying coldne&s;s of her manner deterred me from finding cou|rage
<PB N="142" REF="143">
to a&s;k how Lady Aubrey found her|&s;elf, and indeed I dreaded tru&s;ting my voice with the enquiry. However when the &s;ervants had retired, Mr. Howard &s;aved me the trouble.</P>
<P>My niece tells me &s;he is no wor&s;e, an|&s;wered &s;he coldly; but &s;he is extremely low &s;pirited; and the &s;lighte&s;t agitation in her pre&s;ent weak condition may be fatal to a frame &s;o exhau&s;ted as her's. I own I am under great unea&s;ine&s;s about her: the apprehen&s;ion of a relap&s;e terri|fies me.</P>
<P>A relap&s;e! cried I in a tone which betrayed my emotion, heaven forbid! or we &s;hall never forgive our&s;elves; and leaning my head upon my hand, I found my&s;elf unable longer to pre&s;erve the ap|pearance of the tranquillity I had endea|voured to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard made me &s;wallow a &s;e|cond gla&s;s of Madeira; and Lady Mere|dith &s;eemed &s;o affected with my tears,
<PB N="143" REF="144">
that pre&s;&s;ing my hand with even more than her accu&s;tomed kindne&s;s, all cold|ne&s;s, prejudice, and re&s;erve, &s;eemed in|&s;tantly to give way to the kinde&s;t &s;ym|pathy and mo&s;t &s;oothing compa&s;&s;ion. Compo&s;e your&s;elf, my dear Mi&s;s Sey|mour, cried &s;he; my apprehen&s;ions have been always accu&s;ed of greatly magnify|ing every impending danger. It is ap|prehen&s;ion only, thank God, that leads me to &s;peak in a tone of &s;uch de&s;pon|dency. Lady Aubrey a&s;&s;ures me, that far from being hurt by the late inter|view, it has &s;oothed and gratified her heart; and even had the violence of her feelings, naturally acute, exhau&s;ted her a little for the pre&s;ent, from the kin|dred &s;en&s;ibility of your &s;ympathetic hearts, I fore&s;ee in future infinite &s;atisfaction and con&s;olation to my unfortunate niece in the unexpected happine&s;s of your friend|&s;hip and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject was too delicate to admit
<PB N="144" REF="145">
of more, and &s;oon after we &s;eparated for the night.</P>
<P>This morning, when we met at break|fa&s;t, Lady Meredith paid us her compli|ments with much kindne&s;s, and the ap|pearance of revived &s;pirits. Her niece, &s;he &s;aid, her beloved niece, (for &s;he &s;el|dom mentions her without &s;ome epithet expre&s;&s;ive of affection) had enjoyed an excellent night's re&s;t, and found her&s;elf much refre&s;hed, &s;o I hope in God, Mi&s;s Seymour, all our fears were wholly ground|le&s;s.</P>
<P>On her Lady&s;hip's leaving us imme|diately after breakfa&s;t, Mr. Howard in|formed us that he had had a long walk with her in the morning, for &s;he is an early ri&s;er, and that it had been produc|tive of a very intere&s;ting conver&s;ation; in the cour&s;e of which he had picked up &s;ome particulars relative to Lady Aubrey that he was certain we mu&s;t be eager to learn.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">Lady Meredith, he &s;aid, had entirely contradicted the report, &s;o univer&s;ally cir|culated and &s;o generally credited, of La|dy Aubrey's in&s;anity. A fever of the mo&s;t alarming nature had indeed attacked her brain, and held her life for many weeks &s;u&s;pended; but this was the natu|ral con&s;equence of her misfortunes. Re|turning rea&s;on had been the immediate follower of recruited health: and tho' the mo&s;t mournful depre&s;&s;ion had wholly bani&s;hed tranquillity and peace from her bo&s;om, religion the mo&s;t devout, and re|&s;ignation the mo&s;t humble and &s;incere, had &s;upported her in the height of mi|&s;ery, and had pre&s;erved her from the baneful effects of di&s;traction and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>When her ill fated marriage took place, &s;he had been but a few weeks in England. She had &s;pent her life abroad, where Lord Embdon had acted at the Court of Turin in a public capacity. She had hitherto enjoyed little per&s;onal inter|cour&s;e
<PB N="146" REF="147">
with her numerous relations, and was particularly attached to none of them. Her native country, endeared to her neither by the force of private friend&s;hip nor by the in&s;inuating remembrance of early prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was the inevitable and natural effects of her misfortunes to be di&s;gu&s;ted with it, and her departure was a &s;tep which delicacy, pride, and af|fliction, all con&s;pired to dictate.</P>
<P>The death of Lord Embdon, which happened at this juncture, (a &s;troke which it is to be hoped his weakly con&s;ti|tution rather than his child's calamities had inflicted,) involved the unfortunate daughter in accumulated di&s;tre&s;s. Thank heaven he died of a complaint wherein the &s;pirits are not &s;uppo&s;ed by medical people to influence the di&s;order. He had been for many years afflicted with the &s;tone; and refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to an ope|ration, fell a &s;acrifice to that painful di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">This event, while it di&s;&s;olved her only remaining tie to England, left her wholly at liberty to pur&s;ue her intended &s;cheme of future &s;eclu&s;ion. Her grandfather, the old Earl of Aubrey, indeed &s;till &s;ur|vived, and beheld the ruined peace of his family with the weeping eye of a pa|rent. He entreated his grand daughter, the heire&s;s of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, not to de&s;ert him in his old age; but as &s;he well knew that an hereditary regard for the &s;ucce&s;|&s;or of his name and titles alone dictated this reque&s;t, and that wholly governed by a woman who had lived with him for years, his heart but feebly retained the impre&s;&s;ions of natural affection, her &s;en&s;e of duty did not interfere with the pro&s;e|cution of her intentions.</P>
<P>She therefore bade adieu to England; and having for a &s;hort time boarded her|&s;elf and attendants in the quiet retire|ment of a mona&s;try, &s;he from thence en|quired after an ob&s;cure but elegant re|treat,
<PB N="148" REF="149">
which an early and tender friend|&s;hip for it's decea&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or had en|deared to her remembrance; and having purcha&s;ed it from the pre&s;ent owner, &s;he retired thither with the de&s;ign of &s;eclud|ing her&s;elf for ever from the world.</P>
<P>When this re&s;olution was formed, Mi&s;s Mar&s;don was but eighteen, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the full glow of radience tho&s;e charms which dejection, di&s;appointment, and in|di&s;po&s;ition, for fifteen years more, have &s;carce been able to impair. Her days, bounded by di&s;tre&s;s, the dreary pro&s;pect admitted no ray of reviving con&s;olation except what re&s;ulted from the &s;ocety of one dear and maternal friend, who hav|ing been lately deprived of the hu&s;band of her heart, and never having been ble&s;&s;ed with offspring, flew to indulge with her favorite young friend the un|bounded luxury of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Madame de St. Hillaire, for &s;ome time combated not the intended &s;eclu&s;ion

of her amiable friend. But the violence of her own di&s;tre&s;s yielding to re&s;ignation and compo&s;ure, &s;he became con&s;cious that tho' grief is &s;eldom abated by rea&s;oning the mo&s;t convincing and judicious, time will infallibly le&s;&s;en, and variety in &s;ome mea&s;ure divert, it's bitterne&s;s. Her feel|ings, tho' poignant, were &s;oothing and enthu&s;ia&s;tic: tears uncea&s;ingly fell from her eyes; but they were tears of relief. Some plea&s;ing recollection, &s;ome &s;cene, intere&s;ting and endearing, often made them flow, and the luxuriant reveries of pa&s;t delight in a great mea&s;ure &s;oothed the pre&s;ent &s;ad rever&s;e.</P>
<P>Far otherwi&s;e was the &s;ource of the bitter angui&s;h of her friend.

height of languor and depre&s;&s;ion: all was mi&s;ery unmitigated: the pa&s;t was hor|ror, and the future pre&s;ented only unde|&s;erved mortification and perpetual regret.</P>
<P>In &s;olitude and ob&s;curity were centered the only ideas of dejected tranquillity that could find entrance into the bo&s;om of the fair mourner: a bo&s;om of acute &s;en&s;ibi|lity, chilled by the cold hand of di&s;ap|pointment: but her anxious friend, re|flecting on her youth and amiable di&s;po|&s;ition, hoped that after time had been given for meliorating her &s;orrows into peaceful re&s;ignation, a temper &s;o calcu|lated for the active duties of benevolence would not remain un&s;ubdued by the heartfelt gratifications which that noble principle affords, and fore&s;aw that it would not prove impo&s;&s;ible to prevail with her to relax in her pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Time ju&s;tified the predictions of this valuable friend. By degrees, at her earne&s;t entreaties, a &s;elect acquaintance

was admitted; and altho' through the whole of Lady Aubrey's re&s;idence a|broad, till the pre&s;ent moment, a weight of melancholy impaired her health and clouded her &s;pirits, religion and princi|ple co-operating with the continual ef|forts of Madame de St. Hillaire, greatly &s;oftened the fir&s;t angui&s;h of her &s;uffer|ings; and while &s;he remained incapable of participating in the gaieties of life, its rational comforts were re&s;tored to her re|li&s;h. Her &s;ociety, tho' limited, was ele|gant, and judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en; and her &s;olitary re&s;idence at length began to wear the a&s;pect of a peaceful retirement, which the &s;ad &s;troke of Madame de St. Hil|laire's death, added to the dying reque&s;t of her grandfather, would probably alone have prevailed with Lady Aubrey ever to have quitted.</P>

intreaty to his grand daughter to grant him the &s;atisfaction of beholding once more the la&s;t and only &s;upporter of his family and dignities. She he&s;itated not to obey, however painfully her return to England mu&s;t awaken every &s;ource of angui&s;h, and arrived in London about the end of January, ju&s;t in time to re|ceive his la&s;t injunctions, the old Lord having &s;urvived this affecting meeting only a few days.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey now found her&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the accumulated wealth of a long line of noble and opulent ance&s;try. Independent of tho&s;e e&s;tates which from entail were annexed to the title, her grandfather had left her con&s;iderable pro|perty; and he reque&s;ted that a due re|gard to an ancient and honourable fa|mily, of which &s;he was the head and or|nament, might prevail with her to &s;pend her days in the old family ca&s;tle; where her predece&s;&s;ors had lived time immemo|rial,

adored by their va&s;&s;als, re&s;pected by their friends, and the pride and ble&s;&s;ing of the country around.</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e particulars, Lady Meredith mentioned to Mr. Howard, that though from &s;everal circum&s;tances which on recollection &s;trike her remem|brance, &s;he conjectures her amiable niece wi&s;hed her to be made acquainted with the &s;ingular event of her rencontre with this famiy, never could &s;he &s;ummon cou|rage and calmne&s;s &s;ufficient for entering on the painful &s;ubject till ye&s;terday evening, when the violence of her emotions ren|dering her aunt at once &s;u&s;picious and inqui&s;itive, drew the formidable &s;ecret from her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Tho' tenderly attached to my niece, &s;aid Lady Meredith, the only &s;urviving child of a decea&s;ed &s;i&s;ter whom I almo&s;t idolized, I have not had the happine&s;s, till her late return from abroad, of en|joying much of her company. She has
<PB N="154" REF="155">
&s;pent great part of her life on the conti|nent, where it was only in my power to vi&s;it her once for a few months; and it is only of late, that &s;trict intimacy and affection have taken place which always indeed &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, but in a le&s;s powerful degree, between us. Length of ab&s;ence, and difference of years, have however precluded that unre&s;erved confidence, which, except at the open and undi&s;gui&s;ed period of early youth, is not ea&s;ily be|&s;towed. Aware of the quick &s;en&s;ibility of Lady Aubrey's feelings, I forbore to probe wounds &s;carce clo&s;ed, and care|fully avoided every &s;ubject likely to re|call the pa&s;t to her mind: till la&s;t night, when the emotion in which I found her paved the way for a communication as unexpected as extraordinary. Lady Au|brey confe&s;&s;ed that accident had intro|duced to her knowledge a family, to meet with whom had been her mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h, tho' from a variety of circum&s;tan|ces
<PB N="155" REF="156">
&s;he had for ever de&s;paired of enjoying that &s;atisfaction; and that altho' a com|plication of agitating &s;en&s;ations had wholly overpowered her at the fir&s;t meet|ing, and rendered her &s;o apprehen&s;ive of a &s;econd as to delay it till returning health and &s;trength might enable her to &s;upport the feelings which &s;he knew it mu&s;t occa&s;ion, the inherent &s;atisfaction re&s;ulting from the event &s;he was convin|ced would be of infinite benefit both to her health and tranquillity in future.</P>
<P>It was not difficult, continued Lady Meredith, to divine who this family mu&s;t be: and what I have &s;een of every individual in it, per&s;uades me that Lady Aubrey will not find her&s;elf deceived in this flattering expectation.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard had ju&s;t concluded this intere&s;ting narrative, when Lady Mere|dith entering the parlour, told us that Lady Aubrey reque&s;ted our company; and that while we attended her Lady&s;hip
<PB N="156" REF="157">
&s;he &s;hould accompany Mr. Howard once more in his rambles thro' the wood, as it was impo&s;&s;ible ever to tire in walking over &s;o delightful a &s;pot as Hubert Hill, and &s;he had not yet been &s;hewn all the lions.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter and I then went up &s;tairs. We found our dear Lady Aubrey in bed, for &s;he is not allowed to ri&s;e till the morning is far advanced; but &s;he looked more beautiful as &s;he &s;at upright &s;up|ported by pillows, than any other wo|man I ever beheld in all the pride of youth, dre&s;s, and loveline&s;s.</P>
<P>There is an expre&s;&s;ion of feeling lan|guor in her charming eyes, that would be alone captivating beyond expre&s;&s;ion, even dive&s;ted of the aid they receive from the perfection of her other features, and I am not certain if it would be in my power to admire her &s;o enthu&s;ia&s;tically was &s;he relieved from tho&s;e traces of de|cay, which betraying the ravages of la|tent

<P>She embraced us both tenderly, and apologized for reque&s;ting our company at her bed &s;ide; but I cannot deny my|&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he, the gratification of your company from mere motives of cold ce|remony, while my heart is under the in|fluence of &s;entiments &s;o fervent. I am &s;oothed and gratified beyond expre&s;&s;ion, continued &s;he. My re&s;t la&s;t night was more refre&s;hing and tranquil than any I have enjoyed &s;ince my accident, which, far from accounting unfortunate, I &s;hall ever regard as the ble&s;&s;ing of providence. With a heart overflowing with gratitude to the Almighty, I offered up my hum|ble
<PB N="158" REF="159">
thanks, and compo&s;ed my&s;elf to &s;leep with an inward &s;en&s;ation of relief and &s;a|tisfaction, which ca&s;t a gleam of content|ment even over my dreams and my re|po&s;e.</P>
<P>She appeared indeed calm and com|po&s;ed beyond our mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes; and tho' a tear of feeling often fell from her eye, and her bo&s;om heaved with an oppre&s;&s;ion not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, a &s;mile of re&s;igned benevolence often broke thro' the &s;edate melancholy &s;eated on her in|tere&s;ting countenance, and her &s;ighs &s;eemed more the offspring of relief than unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the effu&s;ions of that melting and &s;oothing tenderne&s;s which linked our hearts together, and which was tacitly acknowledged to have but one common &s;ource in my dear father, yet was his name not once pronounced. Amid&s;t the free and mutual communication which a heart-felt intere&s;t claimed, tho' to this

every circum&s;tance alluded and every en|quiry tended, it was a point at which none of us could arrive. It &s;eemed too &s;acred, too aweful to be uttered, and mu&s;t have led to particulars at which for worlds we would not as yet have ventu|red to hint.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey, however, by degrees informed us of all we were mo&s;t anxious to know: that during the whole period of our re&s;idence abroad &s;he had main|tained a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with Mr. Ben&s;ley, unknown to every one, and under promi&s;e of profound &s;ecrecy. Doubtle&s;s the appearance of pre&s;erving an intercour&s;e of any kind with the a|vowed friend of my father, mu&s;t have &s;eemed an act of impropriety in the eyes of her own family, and might have been deemed romantic by the world; yet could not this amiable, this angelic woman, remain contentedly ignorant of the fate of a man to whom her whole heart had

once been given up, however unworthy he had proved him&s;elf by overwhelming her with unmerited &s;hame and de&s;pair, and by driving her, in the gay &s;ea&s;on of a youth which fortune and nature had con&s;pired to ble&s;s with a thou&s;and envied advantages, to bury her&s;elf in &s;olitude and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Mr. Ben&s;eley, &s;aid Lady Aubrey, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind for &s;everal months previous to my quitting England. From him only could a thou&s;and circum&s;tances reach my knowledge, which it was ab&s;o|lutely e&s;&s;ential to my very exi&s;tence to know, and which to no other per&s;on could even be hinted; yet a number of objections, and difficulties almo&s;t in&s;ur|mountable, deterred me from gratifying a wi&s;h that every moment grew more ir|re&s;i&s;tible. The awkwardne&s;s of an ap|plication by letter appeared formidable, and the apprehen&s;ion of being detected
<PB N="161" REF="162">
in a &s;tep which I well knew my father would deem derogatory to my dignity, and fraught with impropriety, terrified me. This la&s;t bar was, alas! but too &s;oon removed by that dear parent's death; and yielding to the potency of my anx|iety, I ventured at length to write to Mr. Ben&s;eley, and informing him of my re&s;i|dence abroad, where I meant immedi|ately to retire, reque&s;ted the favor from time to time of hearing from him.</P>
<P>By his an&s;wer I was relieved from much mi&s;ery, and &s;pared the angui&s;h of vague and fruitle&s;s conjecture. I was made ac|quainted with a thou&s;and particulars, minute and intere&s;ting: I was &s;atisfied in the point neare&s;t my heart&mdash;the point in|deed which had dictated my ungoverna|ble and eager de&s;ire of information. I was informed of your &s;ecluded re&s;idence in the &s;outh of France, and my fervent and ince&s;&s;ant prayers to heaven I found were at length an&s;wered:&mdash;remor&s;e the

<P>She &s;topped for a moment, unable to proceed; but recovering her&s;elf&mdash;dur|ing this corre&s;pondence, continued &s;he, which regularly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Mr. Ben&s;eley and my&s;elf till within a fort|night of his death, I was minutely in|formed, according to my mo&s;t earne&s;t reque&s;t, of every particular of your man|ner of life, your &s;olitude, your amu&s;e|ments, and the plan of education that had been adopted. All, all was intere&s;t|ing to me; and this &s;ingular participa|tion in your welfare gave an intere&s;t to my exi&s;tence; and while I deplored the bar that for ever excluded all per&s;onal knowledge or intercour&s;e between us, my heart &s;trongly cheri&s;hed and imbibed a warm and maternal affection, which was daily nouri&s;hed and encrea&s;ed by the peru&s;al of letters from B&mdash; with which the worthy Mr. Ben&s;eley, indul|gent
<PB N="163" REF="164">
to my &s;ecret wi&s;hes though not to my avowed reque&s;t, often favoured me. The&s;e letters, dated from your &s;olitary abode in Languedoc, written with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of paternal admiration and affection, repeated with unwearied de|light the virtues, the talents, and accom|pli&s;hments of his amiable daughters; and though merely de&s;igned for the friendly eye of Mr. Ben&s;eley, were faithfully in &s;ecret tran&s;mitted to me. The returning con&s;olation the&s;e epi&s;tles indicated thro' the means of his beloved children, to &s;pirits worn out by agonizing repentance and remor&s;e, began at length to afford comfort to mine, and ble&s;&s;ing heaven for having touched a heart where virtue though ob&s;cured never was eradicated, I in my di&s;tant &s;eclu&s;ion partook of his revived though dejected tranquillity, and bending with due humility under the ju&s;t and aweful di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, &s;trove with augmented fortitude to &s;ub|mit
<PB N="164" REF="165">
to evils to which it had plea&s;ed hea|ven to grant &s;ome alleviation.</P>
<P>In this way many years rolled on: in compliance with the earne&s;t entreaties of a friend, who partook of my retire|ment and &s;hared my &s;orrows, I con|&s;ented to admit the &s;ociety of a few cho|&s;en acquaintances, and at length began to experience the calm tranquillity, which, where religion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a due influence over a mind unburthened with the acute &s;en&s;ations of &s;elf reproach, humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion always in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|&s;tore: yet &s;till the &s;ource, after heaven, from whence my chief comfort flowed, was the frequent and intere&s;ting intelli|gence which Mr. Ben&s;eley's letters, en|clo&s;ing others from the quiet retreat at B&mdash;, often afforded me; till in Octo|ber la&s;t, when a packet from my good friend, which had been anxiou&s;ly ex|pected for an unu&s;ual length of time, was put into my hands. The &s;eal an|nounced
<PB N="165" REF="166">
fatal news, and my heart with &s;ecret apprehen&s;ions died within me.</P>
<P>Though the mo&s;t romantic flight of imagination, continued this amiable wo|man, &s;ighing with a bitterne&s;s that &s;eemed to rend her bo&s;om, never flattered me with the po&s;&s;ibility of more than merely knowing he lived, and the mo&s;t miracu|lous fluctuation of human events could grant me nothing beyond what I at pre|&s;ent enjoyed&mdash;the cold &s;atisfaction of pe|ru&s;ing letters neither addre&s;&s;ed to my&s;elf nor intended for my view; though the hand of death could &s;carce place a bar more un&s;urmountable between us than that which already &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; yet to be told that death it&s;elf had divided us, over|powered me with a pang yet unfelt, the violence of which appeared a&s;toni&s;hing even to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Between tho&s;e calamities, however, with which, by the common lot of mor|tality, we are overwhelmed, and tho&s;e
<PB N="166" REF="167">
which a chequered &s;eries of di&s;mal and &s;ingular events have produced, a mate|rial difference mu&s;t ever be felt. The lenient quality that time &s;o powerfully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in mitigating the a&s;perities of the former, proves wholly ineffectual in tho&s;e afflictions which di&s;appointed af|fection or early mortifications have in|flicted; and I confe&s;s this wound, though in the fir&s;t moments of &s;orrow not inferior perhaps to any I had endured, rea&s;on and reflection much more &s;peedily allayed; unlike the corroding &s;ting which the me|mory of my former mi&s;eries perpetually renewed, a &s;oothing and not unplea&s;ing regret now re&s;ts on my mind, which, while it melts and &s;ubdues my heart, does not rai&s;e a blu&s;h for the uncon|querable weakne&s;s it confe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This affecting conver&s;ation, to which tears on my &s;i&s;ter's part and mine were the only interruption, and which made the eyes of our dear and amiable Lady
<PB N="167" REF="168">
Aubrey overflow with a bitterne&s;s that almo&s;t wholly exhau&s;ted her, terrified me with the apprehen&s;ion of her &s;inking wholly under her agitations. I entreated her to defer for the pre&s;ent all further di&s;|cour&s;e on this &s;ubject, and to allow of our leaving her. But to this &s;he would not be per&s;uaded to con&s;ent. My &s;or|rows have been of &s;uch a nature, &s;aid &s;he, that all communication of them is impo&s;&s;ible; and confidence, a &s;olace which except with my dear decea&s;ed friend Ma|dam de St. Hillaire, I never could enjoy. A painful mixture of &s;hame and pride, encrea&s;ed perhaps by early pro&s;perity and indulgence, &s;ealed my lips, and confined my &s;ufferings to my own &s;olitary and de|&s;olated bo&s;om; how then can my chil|dren, my dear children, (repeated &s;he, folding us alternately in her arms) deny me the &s;atisfaction of giving vent to griefs in which their &s;ympathetic hearts mu&s;t feel a generous concern.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">You may believe, Sophia, we returned the kind care&s;&s;es of this amiable friend with all the enthu&s;ia&s;tic warmth which a conduct &s;o amiable, &s;o truly great, could not fail to excite in circum&s;tances &s;o &s;in|gularly intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey then proceeded to in|form us, that Mr. Ben&s;eley had minutely acquainted her with all our intended &s;chemes, and had with his u&s;ual kindne&s;s voluntarily promi&s;ed, &s;hould his declining health permit of &s;uch a journey, to pay her a vi&s;it in the cour&s;e of the following &s;ummer, attended by his wards; to whom this angelic woman was to have been per&s;onally introduced as a lady who ho|nored him with &s;ingular marks of friend|&s;hip and regard, but without the &s;lighte&s;t hint of any &s;ecret connection.</P>
<P>To this &s;oothing &s;cheme, &s;aid Lady Aubrey, which I had been uncea&s;ingly revolving in my mind how to accom|pli&s;h, I returned a mo&s;t grateful and glad

It is not ea&s;y to expre&s;s the angui&s;h and di&s;appointment I expe|rienced on hearing this di&s;mal intelli|gence. Tho' inured to mortification and regret, I found I had yet much to under|go ere I became callous to their attacks. This blow, by overturning the &s;ole fa|vorite plan on which I had built any re|maining hopes of comfort, &s;unk me to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of de&s;pondency; and the lo&s;s of my invaluable friend, Madame de St. Hillaire, put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to my &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>This la&s;t calamity pre&s;&s;ed hard indeed. In all my other di&s;tre&s;&s;es, this beloved friend had been, under heaven, my chief &s;upport, and had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;up|plied
<PB N="170" REF="171">
the place of all I had lo&s;t. I had &s;till a friend to love, a friend who re|turned my warm affection. An early &s;eparation from my relations in England, had kept me a &s;tranger to all of them, my aunt, Lady Meredith excepted, and &s;he I had known for too &s;hort a period to feel for her that attachment which now fills my heart. I was then bere&s;t of my la&s;t, my only friend. Ah! can human mi&s;ery pre&s;ent a more di&s;mal picture to a heart of &s;en&s;ibility, than the melancholy con&s;ideration that none exi&s;ts to animate the feelings of fervent affection.</P>
<P>Still, however, the only form in which alleviation touched my bo&s;om, was the hopes of one day meeting with you; and revolving on the means to procure my|&s;elf this con&s;olation, in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated my gloomy reflections. I knew not where, or to whom to apply for in|formation; and was in this &s;tate of me|lancholy and uncertainty, when the ac|count

of my Lord Aubrey's illne&s;s and reque&s;t to &s;ee me arrived. Painful as was the idea of revi&s;iting England, I he|&s;itated not in&s;tantly to comply: and my repugnance was in a great mea&s;ure &s;ub|dued, by the hopes of gaining &s;ome in|formation relative to you, tho' to chance alone I could owe the intelligence, Lit|tle likelihood indeed remained of &s;ucce&s;s. A cruel peculiarity of circum&s;tances de|prived me of any light to guide my re|&s;earches, and an open and avowed pur&s;uit was precluded me. Yet the po&s;&s;ibility &s;oothed and &s;upported my &s;pirits; and it was not till I had been &s;ome weeks in London, that I found how totally im|practicable it was to di&s;cover a private family who&s;e names mu&s;t ever be care|fully guarded from my ears. My own maid, who had been with me from my early youth, I ventured to entru&s;t with the enquiry, and two different channels of information occurred; by means of La|dy

Linro&s;e's &s;ervants, with one of whom &s;he was acquainted; and if this failed, Mr. Ben&s;eley's relation might be applied to; but that gentleman I found was lately gone to Holland; and when I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf by letter to him on the &s;ubject, he a&s;&s;ured me in an&s;wer that the ladies names were as wholly unknown to him as was their abode; and Lady Linro&s;e's maid al&s;o informed mine that &s;he did not be|lieve two &s;uch relations were expected by the family, nor had &s;he learnt that any account of them had been received.</P>

Fatigued with the civilities and attentions paid me by a numerous cla&s;s of di&s;tant

relations and family acquaintance, who crowded on me immediately on my ar|rival, I determined to &s;et out for Aubrey Ca&s;tle even at that unpropitious &s;ea&s;on of the year, in defiance of &s;undry remon|&s;trances from my friends, and contrary to the wi&s;hes of my kind aunt, who pro|mi&s;ed to follow when the &s;pring was fur|ther advanced.

<P>Lady Aubrey finds her&s;elf now &s;o much recovered, that the phy&s;icians de|clare their attendance no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;he is now left to Mr. Rudder's care, who generally vi&s;its her twice a day.</P>

She is &s;till very weak; and I am &s;o peremptory in the duties of my office as nur&s;e, that I will not allow of her conver&s;ing on &s;ubjects which I know mu&s;t agitate and affect her. This morn|ing, however, &s;he entreated me to ac|quaint her where and in what manner we had lived &s;ince our arrival in England, and I gave her a brief account of our &s;i|tuation.

<P>LADY Meredith left us &s;ome days ago. Her old man at home, &s;he &s;aid, would be impatient for her return, and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible to what admirable hands &s;he entru&s;ted the care of her dear niece's health. The interval &s;ince I la&s;t wrote, has indeed produced a change &s;o favora|ble in Lady Aubrey's health, that &s;he is able to join us in the parlour; and finds her&s;elf &s;o well, that &s;he talks of leaving Hubert Hill in a few days. This re&s;o|lution we have all combated with all the arguments and entreaties po&s;&s;ible; but

&s;he tells us &s;eriou&s;ly that &s;he really longs to find her&s;elf tranquilly e&s;tabli&s;hed in her new re&s;idence; and we have at length, tho' with great unwillingne&s;s, given up our importunities.</P>
<P>You may believe I readily and joyfully con&s;ented to her earne&s;t reque&s;t of ac|companying her to Aubrey Ca&s;tle, where Mr. and Mrs. Howard are to follow when &s;ome little bu&s;ine&s;s which at pre&s;ent detains the former here is concluded.</P>

<P>I am &s;till at Hubert Hill. Our be|loved Lady Aubrey &s;et off this morning by her&s;elf. This change in our plans is occa&s;ioned by an indi&s;po&s;ition which has &s;eized my &s;i&s;ter, and which, without be|ing in the lea&s;t alarming, renders her low &s;pirited and oppre&s;t. I &s;hould have been unea&s;y at leaving her in her pre&s;ent

&s;ituation; and Lady Aubrey, had I in|clined, would not have de&s;ired it. She has contented her&s;elf therefore with ex|acting Mr. Howard's promi&s;e to carry us both to her in a &s;hort time, when his bu&s;ine&s;s is fini&s;hed and my &s;i&s;ter's health re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Short as is to be this interval of ab|&s;ence, we did not &s;eparate without tears.

<P>Mr. Howard, who is ever anxious to afford us &s;uch amu&s;ements as the unifor|mity of our tranquil &s;tile of life admits, a&s;ked me on Tue&s;day morning if I cho&s;e to accompany him in an excur&s;ion on hor&s;eback towards a part of the country that was entirely new to me, and beauti|fully romantic. I gladly con&s;ented; but ju&s;t as we were equipt for our little ex|cur&s;ion, his attorney from town arrived on bu&s;ine&s;s, and perceiving how incon|venient his leaving home mu&s;t prove, I in&s;i&s;ted on pro&s;ecuting my expedition without him; and merely taking old James the gardener, who has pa&s;t his days in the county, as my e&s;cort.</P>
<P>Fanny was lazy, and would not be per|&s;uaded to &s;tir from her work; &s;o I &s;et off about eleven, the morning being deli|cious
<PB N="181" REF="184">
for the &s;ea&s;on, eager to explore &s;ome particular picture&s;que &s;cenes which Mr. Howard had de&s;cribed as admirable &s;ubjects for my pencil.</P>
<P>The country around was &s;o &s;ingularly beautiful, that I was tempted to go on further than I at fir&s;t intended; for as we are regular people at Hubert Hill, and keep early hours, I wi&s;hed to be home by two o'clock; but the &s;ight of a very fine country &s;eat at no great di&s;tance induced me to prolong my ride, from the de&s;ire of admiring it on a nearer view.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t turned the wall of a park that &s;urrounded a hou&s;e of a very noble appearance, which James, to whom I applied for information, acquainted me was called Holtenham Abbey, when a party of gentlemen and ladies i&s;&s;uing from a gate, with the intention of cro&s;&s;|ing the road, made my mare plunge, and unable to recover my &s;eat, I was
<PB N="182" REF="185">
thrown from it with &s;uch violence that &s;creams re&s;ounded from every voice.</P>
<P>Happily I did not &s;uffer from any in|tanglement with the &s;tirrup or accoutre|ments, and felt at the moment no other bad con&s;equences from the fall, than the painful one of confu&s;ion at having &s;o many people to witne&s;s this awkward ac|cident, added to that di&s;may which the &s;udden &s;hock unavoidably occa&s;ioned me.</P>
<P>I believe half a dozen gentlemen at lea&s;t flew in&s;tantly to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to rai&s;e me from the ground, where, con|founded and without motion, I lay for &s;ome moments. Good heavens, Madam, exclaimed they all, one after another, how do you find your&s;elf? I hope you are not hurt? Where have you &s;uffered? and the re&s;t of the company, who &s;eemed di&s;per&s;ed in walking parties of two or three together, ju&s;t then coming up, I felt my&s;elf nearly as &s;everely &s;tunned by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive repetitions of the &s;ame en|quiries,
<PB N="183" REF="186">
to which at fir&s;t I was unable to make any reply, as I was by the fall it|&s;elf. Smelling bottles were pre&s;ented me from all quarters; yet &s;ome little time elap&s;ed before I could even recollect my|&s;elf &s;ufficiently to expre&s;s my thanks for the kindne&s;s and humanity of their &s;olici|tude.</P>
<P>An elderly lady, who appeared parti|cularly concerned for me, and who &s;eemed to be owner of the noble man&s;ion, in&s;i&s;ted, the moment I was a little reco|vered, on having me conveyed into the hou&s;e, from which an avenue of no great length only divided us; and a&s;ked me, with much civility and tenderne&s;s, if I found it impo&s;&s;ible with a&s;&s;i&s;tance to walk towards it.</P>
<P>Happy to e&s;cape from the company, and embarra&s;&s;ed by the curio&s;ity and no|tice I excited, I thankfully accepted this obliging offer, and made a feeble attempt to move forward.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">Pray allow me the honor of conduct|ing you, &s;aid a young man, who had obliged me to lean on his arm, but who&s;e face from perturbation I had not yet di&s;|tingui&s;hed: the voice, however, was fa|miliar to my ears, and on regarding him I recollected my a&s;&s;i&s;tant to be Captain Brad&s;haw, the friend of Roat&s;ley, again&s;t whom, notwith&s;tanding that circum|&s;tance, I had conceived no &s;mall degree of prejudice, from cau&s;es which you will I am certain recollect.</P>
<P>At the in&s;tant I ca&s;t my eyes on him, Mi&s;s Seymour, I believe, &s;aid he, and bowed with a diffidence that te&s;tified he had not forgotten the &s;elf-introduction to which he owed the acquaintance.</P>
<P>The old lady then led the way; and I &s;lowly followed, &s;upported by Mr. Brad|&s;haw, without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I now found I &s;hould have been unable to have &s;tirred, from a &s;evere &s;prain in my foot. Indeed &s;o painful did it feel, that had not
<PB N="185" REF="188">
my anxiety to e&s;cape from ob&s;ervation &s;upplied me with fortitude to endure the unea&s;ine&s;s that walking occa&s;ioned, I &s;hould have concluded moving impo&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the ladies &s;eemed inclined to accompany us, tho' I very earne&s;tly en|treated that I might not be the means of interrupting their walk. My worthy pa|trone&s;s however perceiving their intended civility con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed my per|plexity, immediately &s;aid, pray ladies and gentlemen don't let this accident in|terfere with your rambles: &s;ince it has not, thank heaven, turned out very un|happily, Mr. Brad&s;haw and I &s;hall attend the young lady; and &s;aying this, &s;he made a motion with her hand, which obliged the whole party, tho' with &s;eeming reluc|tance, to leave us; for &s;o powerfully does curio&s;ity and the love of novelty prevail in mo&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, that perceiving I was not a &s;evere &s;ufferer from the accident,
<PB N="186" REF="189">
the company appeared to regard it as a little adventure, the conclu&s;ion of which they &s;hould not have been &s;orry to have witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When we reached the hou&s;e, at which I did not arrive without con&s;iderable dif|ficulty, the door was opened by a foot|man, who u&s;hered us into a &s;uperb par|lour, where a young lady apparently of about &s;eventeen, who might have &s;at for the picture of Hebe, was placed by the fire with a book in her hand.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to have been confined by &s;ome &s;light ailment, having a large cap and hood tied carele&s;sly under her chin.</P>
<P>I have brought you an unfortunate in|valid, Mi&s;s Lucy, cried my conductre&s;s, and explained my accident in a few words, while Mr. Brad&s;haw flew to pro|cure me a gla&s;s of cold water.</P>
<P>Good God, Madam, what a &s;hocking accident! cried the young lady with much kindne&s;s. How dreadfully pale
<PB N="187" REF="190">
you look: pray where are you hurt? I hope not &s;everely? and no &s;ooner had I acknowledged that I &s;u&s;pected my foot had been &s;lightly di&s;located, than &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted on &s;upporting me into her dre&s;&s;ing room; where, while the lady of the hou&s;e di&s;patched a &s;ervant for a neigh|bouring &s;urgeon, this amiable &s;tranger a&s;&s;i&s;ted her maid in chafing my foot with Goulard and water to allay the &s;wel|ling, which had encrea&s;ed rapidly from the effort of walking.</P>
<P>Lady Mary, for &s;o I found this ho&s;pita|ble old lady was called, ordered wine and cordials of all kinds to be in&s;tantly brought, which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on admini&s;|tering to me with a benevolence that di&s;played her character in a point of view &s;o humane as to give me the mo&s;t fa|vourable opinion of her heart. Her young friend was if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more kind and equally anxious to provide every thing for my ea&s;e and comfort. My foot
<PB N="188" REF="191">
however grew more unea&s;y, and &s;oon be|came &s;o &s;welled as to be perfectly &s;tiff and extremely painful.</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf wor&s;e, I was appre|hen&s;ive of being laid up with this &s;tranger family, which &s;pite of their civility and goodne&s;s might have proved as inconve|nient for them as di&s;agreeable to my&s;elf: I made therefore as light of the accident as I po&s;&s;ibly could; a&s;&s;ured the ladies it was quite trifling, and in&s;i&s;ted on re|mounting my mare and returning home; promi&s;ing to walk her gently, and plead|ing the terror my &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t endure at my unaccountable length of ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon made his appearance ju&s;t as I &s;poke, and joined the ladies in re|garding this propo&s;al as ab&s;olute frenzy. There is no treating ca&s;ualties of &s;uch a nature in this manner, Madam, &s;aid he, with much pompo&s;ity, and though it is to be hoped that ten days confinement, with proper care, may effect a cure, as
<PB N="189" REF="192">
many weeks, if you are imprudent, may not &s;et you again on foot.</P>
<P>If I was your father or mother, my dear Madam, cried Lady Mary, or any relation who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed authority or influ|ence over you, I &s;hould not only now, but <HI>for ever</HI> prohibit your again ventur|ing on the back of that fiery, dangerous animal. I can no way reconcile my&s;elf, added &s;he, to the pre&s;ent prevailing mode of ladies becoming profe&s;&s;ed jockies; an unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion for the ma&s;culine accompli&s;hment of hor&s;eman&s;hip &s;eems now a days to have extended even to our &s;ex, and it mu&s;t certainly be acknow|ledged the lea&s;t graceful and mo&s;t ab&s;urd cu&s;tom that fa&s;hion ever introduced among females. I am &s;ure it per&s;uades many a timid girl to brave dangers from which, under any other form, &s;he would &s;hrink with terror: but the <HI>ton</HI> is not only a &s;ufficient apology for &s;uch enterprizes, but a &s;upport likewi&s;e. Excu&s;e the free|dom
<PB N="190" REF="193">
of my ob&s;ervation, dear Madam, continued &s;he with a good humoured &s;mile, and pray give me leave to &s;end to inform your friends that you are &s;afe and in good hands.</P>
<P>I returned a thou&s;and thanks to Lady Mary for her benevolent civilities; but entreated &s;he would not in&s;i&s;t on my &s;tay as I acknowledged my&s;elf extremely anx|ious to get home, and a&s;&s;ured her there was not the &s;lighte&s;t probable danger in my returning on hor&s;eback, as my mare was remarkably &s;afe, and my fall had merely re&s;ulted from the &s;udden appear|ance of &s;ome of the company, which had &s;tartled her.</P>
<P>As to your going on hor&s;eback, cried &s;he, pray talk of it no more, for indeed you mu&s;t not think of &s;uch imprudence. However, &s;ince you are &s;o very eager to leave us, I really wi&s;h it was in my power to contrive your removal in the way that would the lea&s;t &s;ubject you to
<PB N="191" REF="194">
inconvenience and unea&s;ine&s;s; but un|fortunately I have at pre&s;ent no carriage to offer you; my niece's chariot requir|ing &s;ome alterations, was left behind us in town, &s;o that for &s;ome weeks we &s;hall have no equipage but my coach, which a lady, who is ju&s;t now my gue&s;t, got this morning to pay a vi&s;it in the neigh|bourhood, and I am really uncertain whe|ther or not &s;he will be home till the even|ing. Pray, my dear, turning to her young friend, is there any hopes, think you, that Lady Linro&s;e will behave bet|ter than her promi&s;e, and return to us before dinner.</P>
<P>Conceive my regret and a&s;toni&s;hment, Sophia, at the &s;ound of a name I &s;o lit|tle expected to hear, and imagine to your|&s;elf my concern upon finding there was &s;o much probability of my meeting with her Lady&s;hip, which her return every in&s;tant might &s;ubject me to; a mortifica|tion which of all things on earth I mo&s;t
<PB N="192" REF="195">
wi&s;hed to avoid. I was thunder&s;truck on perceiving my&s;elf plunged into a &s;itu|ation &s;o awkward, and changed colour &s;o rapidly, that had not the ladies been happily otherwi&s;e engaged, they mu&s;t have remarked my emotion.</P>
<P>I am indeed afraid, Madam, replied Mi&s;s Lucy, that my mother's return will hardly leave time &s;ufficient for the young lady's removal this evening; for you know Mrs. Pelcourt and &s;he are old friends; they mu&s;t always have a long chat when they meet, and I make no doubt that if &s;he in&s;i&s;ts on it, my mother will pa&s;s the day with her.</P>
<P><HI>Her mother.</HI> Here was a fre&s;h &s;ur|pri&s;e, which wholly di&s;concerted me. To find my&s;elf all at once involved in difficulties &s;o &s;ingular and unlooked for, &s;urrounded by relations who had behaved &s;o unworthily by me, and who mu&s;t feel them&s;elves, when they made the di&s;co|very, &s;o a&s;hamed, &s;o vexed at the ren|contre,
<PB N="193" REF="196">
threw me into a confu&s;ion and perplexity not to be expre&s;&s;ed; and the idea that it was not impo&s;&s;ible but Roat&s;|ley him&s;elf might be of the party, put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to my embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>You will a&s;k, I know, Sophia, why I, who was on this occa&s;ion the &s;uffering per&s;on, who had done no injury to La|dy Linro&s;e, and who had no cau&s;e to blu&s;h for my conduct towards her or her family, &s;hould undergo &s;uch apprehen|&s;ions at the thoughts of &s;eeing her:&mdash;ap|prehen&s;ions that ought only to have at|tended the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of mi&s;conduct. I own there might have been more &s;pirit perhaps in braving than in yielding to my pre&s;ent feelings; but the certainty of plunging a whole family into confu&s;ion was by no means either &s;oothihg to my pride or gratifying to my re&s;entment. I felt my&s;elf an unwelcome intruder, who was about to create di&s;turbance and un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and I &s;unk under the dread of the &s;cene that awaited me.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197">Come, dear Madam, cried Lady Ma|ry, finding I was &s;ilent, this day at lea&s;t you mu&s;t be contented to remain my gue&s;t: to-morrow, if you continue thus impatient, my carriage &s;hall attend your commands; but in the mean time pray allow me to a&s;k whither the me&s;&s;age &s;hall be directed with the a&s;&s;urances of your &s;afety?</P>
<P>You are all goodne&s;s, Madam, &s;aid I at length, and I am truly a&s;hamed of appearing thus ob&s;tinate and ungrateful; but indeed bu&s;ine&s;s of real moment, bu|&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t importance, renders my ab&s;ence from home &s;o particularly un|fortunate, that my &s;tay is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I &s;poke with an energy that I believe &s;urpri&s;ed them, and mu&s;t have &s;urmount|ed all oppo&s;ition had my removal been practicable.</P>
<P>Since the lady is &s;o eager to be gone, &s;aid the &s;urgeon, I think &s;he might be conveyed with tolerable &s;afety in a coach,
<PB N="195" REF="198">
where her leg might be extended at ea&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;eat; but as for any other mode of travelling, particularly on hor&s;e|back, that, Madam, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me with much importance, you would find not merely inconvenient but painful in the extreme, and really when patients refu&s;e to be directed by their medical at|tendants, they undoubtedly cannot be|come re&s;pon&s;ible for the con&s;equences of imprudence.</P>
<P>The awkwardne&s;s of my &s;ituation giv|ing defiance to all alarm, I was beyond mea&s;ure provoked with the pedantic pa|rade of this man, who made my deter|mination to depart appear &s;till more &s;tub|born and unaccountable: but the mo|ment he left the room, I enquired, tho' with many expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and obligation, if a carriage could not be procured from the neighbouring village.</P>
<P>It is a poor little place, an&s;wered Lady Mary, and boa&s;ts of no conveyance be|yond
<PB N="196" REF="199">
a cart. I believe a hired chai&s;e might indeed be had from N&mdash;; but 'tis twelve miles di&s;tant, and it mu&s;t be &s;o late before it could arrive, that I &s;hould imagine a few hours could make little difference. 'Tis already almo&s;t two; and before a &s;ervant could go and return, the night mu&s;t be far advanced: at all events to-morrow you &s;hall have my coach; and tho' I ought to a&s;k pardon for importun|ing you &s;o much, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I &s;ecretly &s;u&s;pect this bu&s;ine&s;s of impor|tance to be nothing more than a pretext under which you wi&s;h to relieve the fears of your family in per&s;on. Now, my dear Madam, be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall be mo&s;t happy to be favoured with the company of any of your friends who on this oc|ca&s;ion may chu&s;e to vi&s;it you, and as a me&s;&s;age to that effect can be in&s;tantly di&s;patched by your own &s;ervant, &s;ome of your family will join you in a few hours.</P>
<P>This is a plan, cried Mi&s;s Lucy with
<PB N="197" REF="200">
the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, which cannot fail to render you perfectly at ea&s;e; &s;o do pray, dear Madam, be prevailed with at lea&s;t to continue with us till to-morrow.</P>
<P>My &s;ituation became now more di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing than ever. I at la&s;t determined on di&s;patching James in all ha&s;te to Hubert Hill, with orders in&s;tantly to return with Mr. Howard's one hor&s;e chair, and this plan I flattered my&s;elf would &s;ave me the mortification of the impending meeting, as in all likelihood it would arrive before Lady Linro&s;e returned from her vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Yet a thou&s;and different rea&s;ons ren|dered this &s;cheme, tho' the be&s;t I could devi&s;e at the time, defective and un|comfortable. Lady Linro&s;e I might by this means avoid; but her &s;on might &s;till be of the party; he, and the re&s;t of the family, I might &s;till encounter; and the late pecuniary tran&s;actions that had taken place &s;ince we la&s;t met, the indigent light in which I had been repre&s;ented to
<PB N="198" REF="201">
him, and the pride and incivility of his behaviour on the di&s;covery he had &s;o re|cently made, all con&s;pired to make me wi&s;h my&s;elf in any quarter of the globe at that in&s;tant rather than under the &s;ame roof with him. A confu&s;ion of painful and even oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;ations agitated and perplexed me, while I felt proud, piqued, and di&s;plea&s;ed. I was &s;unk, humbled, and dejected, and tears, owing their &s;ource le&s;s to mortification than &s;en&s;ibility, threatened every moment to bur&s;t from my eyes.</P>
<P>This plan, however, I now di&s;covered with bitter di&s;may, was impracticable, for the day had &s;uddenly changed it's a&s;|pect, and it rained with great violence; and tho' I would with plea&s;ure have de|fied any inconveniency, I knew not how to in&s;i&s;t further on departing without in|curring the imputation of being &s;elf-wil|led and capricious. The weather equally prohibited every mode of travelling, ex|cepting
<PB N="199" REF="202">
that which was not to be procur|ed; therefore all re&s;i&s;tance was at an end; and it only remained that I &s;hould en|deavour to comply with a good grace to this cruel nece&s;&s;ity. My countenance, I am afraid, betrayed my feelings; for my two amiable companions joined in intreat|ing me to make my&s;elf ea&s;y, and be|&s;ought me to lo&s;e no time in di&s;patching my &s;ervant home with Lady Mary's kind me&s;&s;age to my friends.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they &s;poke, two ladies entered the dre&s;&s;ing room. May I u&s;e the free|dom to enquire for the young lady, &s;aid one of them, (whom I recollected to have been particularly obliging and attentive to me at the moment of my accident,) I was &s;orry to learn below that it had been found nece&s;&s;ary to call a &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>His attendance Madam, an&s;wered I, was wholly unnece&s;&s;ary, as a &s;light &s;prain is all the inconvenience my fall has occa|&s;ioned; and I am &s;ure I ought not to re|gret
<PB N="200" REF="203">
an accident to which I owe &s;o much kindne&s;s and civility.</P>
<P>Indeed I am extremely &s;orry you have been &s;o unfortunate, returned &s;he; tho' we have profited &s;o much from the event, that if it is only the means of confining you with us for &s;ome little time, we &s;hall find difficulty enough in regretting it.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to return an an&s;wer ex|pre&s;&s;ive of my &s;atisfaction on having en|countered a family who&s;e humanity did &s;o much honor to their characters; but my mind was unea&s;y, and I fear my looks contradicted my words.</P>
<P>Yes, cried Lady Mary, interrupting, me, yet you were &s;o extremely unwilling to tru&s;t your&s;elf, tho' but for a &s;ingle night, with this &s;ame ho&s;pitable family, that do you know, niece, our invalid in|&s;i&s;ted on returning upon the identical hor&s;e that gave us all this alarm, in &s;pite of the &s;urgeon's denunciation again&s;t &s;o imprudent a &s;cheme.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204">Good heavens! dear Madam, what an idea! But I hope you have entirely given up all thoughts of &s;uch a plan.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, however, in my ac|count of this formidable day, I mu&s;t in|terrupt the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation by giving you a de&s;cription of this lady, who&s;e manners and conver&s;ation appear &s;o affa|ble and engaging. I told you there were two who entered together; but the friend who accompanied this engaging young lady, and on who&s;e arm &s;he hung, was remarkable for nothing but an air of &s;ycophanti&s;h ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, which in|&s;tantly informed me &s;he re&s;ided in the fa|mily in the comfortable capacity of an humble friend.</P>
<P>The young lady her&s;elf appeared about twenty. Her extreme height, which rendered her figure at fir&s;t &s;ight remarka|ble, had not imbibed the &s;lighte&s;t degree of that awkwardne&s;s which often in very tall people precludes grace; on the con|trary,
<PB N="202" REF="205">
her form was uncommonly ele|gant, and her features, tho' not &s;o regu|lar on examination as a fir&s;t glance lead me to conclude, being embelli&s;hed by a very beautiful complexion, and her &s;hape improved by an ea&s;y air, fully entitled her to the encomium of being what is generally e&s;teemed <HI>a prodigious fine woman.</HI> You will pre&s;ently di&s;cover, Sophia, why my pen is &s;o minute in it's de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>I was much embarra&s;&s;ed how to make an adequate return to &s;o much civility, and yet retain in my own option the power of departing &s;hould an opportunity offer.</P>
<P>I hope you will believe Ladies, &s;aid I at length, that on any other occa&s;ion I &s;hould have been beyond mea&s;ure grati|fied with an opportunity of cultivating an acquaintance, which even by anticipa|tion gives me the mo&s;t &s;incere plea&s;ure; but this day my leaving home is &s;o &s;ingu|larly inconvenient, that I mu&s;t confe&s;s I
<PB N="203" REF="206">
&s;hall not be quite at ea&s;e till I find my|&s;elf there; and if the evening improves, I hope you will neither conclude me un|grateful nor ob&s;tinate, if I &s;till per&s;i&s;t in my fir&s;t intentions. Hubert Hill is not, by my &s;ervant's account, above &s;even or eight miles di&s;tant, and I mean to &s;end him off directly with orders to return with Mr. Howard's little carriage, which if the afternoon proves tolerable, is a very ea&s;y conveyance.</P>
<P>Oh no doubt he will &s;end his coach for you, cried the young lady. But are you quite determined to leave us?</P>
<P>Mr. Howard? &s;aid Lady Mary. I have the plea&s;ure of knowing him well, and an excellent man he is. I was indeed told that he had lately entered into the mar|ried &s;tate, but I did not know how for|tunate he had been.</P>
<P>Perceiving her mi&s;take, I pre&s;ently un|deceived her by &s;aying that my &s;i&s;ter was equally &s;o in her union with a man of his &s;ingular worth.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207">I make no doubt of it, returned &s;he: Mr. Howard is a character of uncommon merit, who&s;e connexion mu&s;t confer hap|pine&s;s on any family with whom he is al|lied. I had at all events intended my|&s;elf the honor of waiting upon him and his new married lady, but I &s;hall now have an additional motive.</P>
<P>Both Mr. Howard and my &s;i&s;ter, I told her, would be much flattered with the intended favor; and added, that my bro|ther's one hor&s;e chair would prove a &s;afe and comfortable conveyance for my re|turn, as in &s;pite of my apparent courage I felt no inclination to venture on hor&s;e|back, &s;ince a more agreeable method of getting home could be adopted.</P>
<P>It was wonderful to ob&s;erve the &s;ud|den change which this la&s;t &s;peech effected upon the manners of the young lady who&s;e affability had hitherto appeared &s;o engaging. An expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urprize, which her countenance betrayed, might
<PB N="205" REF="208">
have pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed, as al&s;o the ob&s;er|vation of her companion, who had not as yet articulated one &s;yllable, but had remained in re&s;pectful &s;ilence till a faint &s;mile from her young patrone&s;s induced her to &s;ay, truly it may prove a very &s;afe, but &s;urely it can't prove a very <HI>comfortable</HI> conveyance in &s;uch an evening as this promi&s;es to be.</P>
<P>The alteration which took place in the behaviour of the other, &s;oon after con|vinced me I had con&s;iderably abated of my importance in her eyes, from being known. She immediately walked to|wards the window; her friend followed, and they whi&s;pered together &s;ome mi|nutes, while the bell &s;ummoned Mi&s;s Lucy's maid to di&s;patch James to Hu|bert Hill.</P>
<P>So tis only the people at the little white hou&s;e on the hill, &s;aid the young lady in a low voice which I could di&s;tinctly over|hear while the me&s;&s;age was tran&s;acting;
<PB N="206" REF="209">
her friend replied with &s;o much caution that I could only di&s;tingui&s;h the words, quite private &s;ort of people, I a&s;&s;ure your Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>Lady Mary looked towards them as if unea&s;y at their behaviour, and addre&s;s|ing her&s;elf to her niece, endeavoured to engage her in general conver&s;ation: but evidently undeceived as to the fancied importance of the vi&s;itor, her looks of civility and expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s were converted into &s;ilent indifference and haughty unconcern; and as if her curio|&s;ity had been now thoroughly &s;atisfied, &s;he &s;oon after left the room.</P>
<P>Well, Mi&s;s Seymour, cried Lady Ma|ry, whether you leave us or not, pray, while we have the plea&s;ure of your com|pany, don't let us deprive the re&s;t of my gue&s;ts of partaking of it. I hope you are able to walk into the next room.</P>
<P>The amiable Mi&s;s Dudley then in&s;i&s;t|ing that I &s;hould take the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
<PB N="207" REF="210">
her arm, I made &s;hift, tho' with no &s;mall degree of pain, to walk into the drawing room, which was luckily on the &s;ame floor.</P>
<P>When we entered, we found &s;everal gentlemen and ladies differently employ|ed: the young lady before mentioned was placed at the harp&s;ichord, &s;urround|ed by mo&s;t of the former, whom &s;he &s;eemed enchanting by the divine power of mu&s;ic. Our appearance interrupted her for a moment; but after &s;lightly bowing, &s;he continued her concerto.</P>
<P>The gentlemen all advanced, and made their enquiries after me with great po|litene&s;s. I ca&s;t my eyes over them with an anxious look, and a &s;en&s;ation of &s;ome|thing not unlike di&s;appointment, on per|ceiving that Roat&s;ley was not of the party, di&s;covered to me that I &s;hould not have been quite &s;o &s;orry to have beheld him as I had imagined.</P>
<P>Captain Brad&s;haw, the only per&s;on in
<PB N="208" REF="211">
company whom till that morning I had ever &s;et eyes on, appeared to regard him|&s;elf as an acquaintance, and paid me par|ticular attention. Ah, Sophia! how do trifles, as I have more than once ob|&s;erved, often influence us. This young man, again&s;t whom I had cheri&s;hed no &s;mall degree of di&s;like, now no longer appeared what I u&s;ed formerly to con&s;ider him. Nothing had occurred to alter my prejudice; yet it was already gone. I could regard him only as the friend of Roat&s;ley; as his friend, I was convinced he mu&s;t have merit; and the attentions of that friend could not but prove agree|able to me.</P>
<P>The certainty too of making him ab|jure his injurious opinion of me, grati|fied my pride, and the idea, &s;uppo&s;ing Roat&s;ley was not at Holtenham, that on their next meeting Captain Brad&s;haw might chance to mention me to him, gave life to my conver&s;ation, even while
<PB N="209" REF="212">
my &s;pirits were every moment &s;inking under the apprehen&s;ion of the return of Lady Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>I could not help feeling confounded, when Mi&s;s Lucy Dudley, taking her re|ference from Mr. Brad&s;haw, called me occa&s;ionally <HI>Mi&s;s Seymour.</HI> The name, it is true, could lead to nothing, yet the certainty that &s;he mu&s;t have heard of me under that appellation confu&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Oh! with what plea&s;ure did I contem|plate the countenance of the only female relation, my &s;i&s;ter excepted, whom I ever recollect to have &s;een, and how did I trace all the amiable qualities in its ex|pre&s;&s;ion which Mi&s;s Par&s;ons's letter lead me to expect. Mi&s;s Jenny kindly tells me, that a family likene&s;s between her features and mine augmented the parti|ality &s;he was inclined to feel for her. Ah! Sophia! do you imagine that a &s;trong and remarkable re&s;emblance to her bro|ther dimini&s;hed the affection I was di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="210" REF="213">
to retain for her, from the mo|ment &s;he was introduced to me.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I was pre&s;ented to her, I thought I remembered having &s;een her before; but it was not immediately that I recollected her to be the young lady who once occa&s;ioned me a pang, (I am &s;orry to confe&s;s it,) not unlike jealou&s;y on perceiving her &s;eated next her brother at the Opera, the evident object of his peculiar regard. There is the &s;tronge&s;t &s;imilarity in the tones of their voices, which are both uncommonly plea&s;ing, and &s;omething even in their turn of ex|pre&s;&s;ion &s;o much alike, that the &s;weet Lucy recalled her brother every in&s;tant to my mind. Indeed, independent of this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, her countenance and manners convey an idea of &s;uch infinite &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility, that I think at all times I mu&s;t have been partial to her.</P>
<P>She had placed her&s;elf on the &s;opha by me; but in &s;pite of her evident wi&s;h to
<PB N="211" REF="214">
le&s;&s;en the awkwardne&s;s of my &s;ituation, &s;urrounded by a large company to whom but two hours before I had been acciden|tally introduced, and not one of who&s;e names, (Captain Brad&s;haw's excepted,) I even knew, you may believe the con|ver&s;ation was not kept up without vi&s;ible difficulty.</P>
<P>At this time the young lady, before &s;o particularly de&s;cribed, &s;at at her harp&s;i|chord rattling over &s;ome little cotillion tunes, and occa&s;ionally interrupting her|&s;elf to laugh and chat with &s;everal gen|tlemen who leant over her chair. Indeed I &s;oon perceived the mu&s;ic was only a pretence to render the conver&s;ation, of which the poor &s;tranger was evidently the topic, le&s;s remarked. She often looked at me her&s;elf, and carried the eyes of the gentlemen to examine me, while &s;he continued her di&s;cour&s;e in a half whi&s;per, which the jumbling of the keys prevented my overhearing.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="215">She appeared in great &s;pirits; but an affectation too vi&s;ible in every motion de&s;troyed at lea&s;t to me the natural grace of her appearance. I began to &s;u&s;pect &s;he might be Mi&s;s Dudley; which idea prevented me from gratifying my curio|&s;ity by means of her &s;i&s;ter, and I em|ployed my&s;elf ineffectually in trying to di&s;cover a re&s;emblance in her features either to tho&s;e of Mi&s;s Lucy or her bro|ther.</P>
<P>At length,however, on that young lady's being called to the end of the room to examine &s;ome mu&s;ic, I enquired of Captain Brad&s;haw the name of the lady at the harp&s;ichord; adding, I was &s;o &s;ingularly &s;ituated as to be a &s;tranger to the whole company.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be ignorant of it, &s;aid he in a tone of &s;urprize. It is the celebrated and admired Lady Eliza|beth Sedley, whom I am certain you mu&s;t at lea&s;t have heard of often.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="216">Sophia, conceive, if you can, my feel|ings at this information. Ah! no! it is impo&s;&s;ible: for except in a &s;imilar &s;itu|ation, they are not to be conceived. My heart beat violently, even while a &s;udden faintne&s;s came over me, and I fear my agitation mu&s;t have been too apparent, for Mi&s;s Lucy ju&s;t then returning to her &s;eat, &s;aid with much &s;weetne&s;s&mdash;I am afraid, Mi&s;s Seymour, your foot is more unea&s;y than you will own, for you look extremely pale; and Mr. Brad&s;haw fixed his eyes on me with a look of inve&s;tigation that &s;oon changed my complexion from the palid to a deeper dye.</P>
<P>The gentlemen now approaching the &s;opha, the harp&s;ichord &s;eemed de&s;erted; and &s;o I imagine thought Lady Elizabeth, for advancing towards us, &s;he called out in a tone of carele&s;s familiarity, I am a|fraid, Mi&s;s Seymour, this will be a mi|&s;erable afternoon for your excur&s;ion in the one hor&s;e chair, for it rains extremely hard.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="217">The voice in which &s;he pronounced the&s;e words let me into a &s;ecret that I had before half &s;u&s;pected, viz. that the mean|ne&s;s of my equipage had &s;o much lowered me in her Lady&s;hip's e&s;timation, as to produce the change in her manner for which I had not been able to a&s;&s;ign any other motive.</P>
<P>I know not whether Mi&s;s Dudley felt the indelicacy of her behaviour, but &s;he immediately &s;aid, it is indeed extremely unfortunate, &s;ince Mi&s;s Seymour is &s;o anxious to go, that Mamma &s;hould have occupied Lady Mary's coach to-day; for the&s;e little carriages, tho' mighty plea&s;ant in fine weather, are not well adapted for rain.</P>
<P>Oh in &s;uch an evening the thing is im|po&s;&s;ible, cried all the gentlemen at once. Mi&s;s Seymour cannot &s;urely think of it.</P>
<P>It rained indeed harder than ever; and I was truly provoked by a change of weather &s;o teizing and unlucky. My
<PB N="215" REF="218">
foot was painful, my mind unea&s;y, I re|quired re&s;t for both, and here I was not likely to enjoy ea&s;e in any form.</P>
<P>A carriage was &s;oon after heard driv|ing up to the door, and my heart panted with expectation. I was convinced it was Mr. Roat&s;ley, and no longer har|boured a doubt when I heard Mr. Brad|&s;haw call out, I dare &s;ay it is Roat&s;ley, and in&s;tantly went out to meet him.</P>
<P>My perturbation, however, was not of long continuance; for this &s;peech con|vinced me that tho' he might be expected he made not one of the family; and pre|&s;ently after Mr. Brad&s;haw returned, ac|companied by Sir Edward Sudbury.</P>
<P>He met with a very gracious reception from the whole company, particularly from Lady Elizabeth, who &s;eemed much plea&s;ed by his entrance. As he did not immediately recognize me among&s;t &s;o large a company, I began to imagine that perhaps he de&s;igned to conduct him&s;elf
<PB N="216" REF="219">
with a prudent re&s;erve; and recollecting his advances in town, which had been in|terrupted by my departure, now ab&s;ence had probably cooled his flame, he might incline to keep at a di&s;tance and withdraw his notice by degrees.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found, however, how unju&s;t was this &s;urmi&s;e, when Sir Edward, di&s;|covering me, approached with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty and politene&s;s, a glow of &s;ati&s;|faction being vi&s;ible on his countenance.</P>
<P>He enquired with anxiety after my health, then for my &s;i&s;ter and Mr. How|ard, and regretted in &s;trong terms my un|expected departure from town, which he &s;aid had a&s;toni&s;hed him, as he had no doubt of finding me at Mrs. Hindon's on his return from a &s;hort vi&s;it he had made in the country about that time.</P>
<P>Dinner was &s;oon after announced; and tho' with pain I walked into the parlour, &s;upported by the arm of the &s;weet Lucy, who gaily ordered all the gentlemen to
<PB N="217" REF="220">
depart before us, and re&s;olutely refu&s;ed all their offers of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me.</P>
<P>She kindly placed her&s;elf next me at table; and Sir Edward, though Lady Elizabeth in a manner invited him to go to the other &s;ide by her&s;elf, contrived to &s;eat him&s;elf on my other hand. This little mortification by no means &s;oftened the hauteur of her behaviour to me; on the contrary, from the moment &s;he remarked Sir Edward's a&s;&s;iduities, her countenance betrayed a &s;cornful di&s;plea|&s;ure, but ill concealed under the ma&s;k of neglect and indifference.</P>
<P>As the evening advanced, I grew more engro&s;&s;ed with the expectation of &s;eeing Lady Linro&s;e; and about eight her La|dy&s;hip entered the drawing room, ac|companied by her elde&s;t daughter.</P>
<P>I ea&s;ily recollected the face that had been pointed out to me at the Opera. It's expre&s;&s;ion, however, was much changed. The &s;our &s;everity of her a&s;pect
<PB N="218" REF="221">
had now entirely given place to &s;miles, good humour, and conde&s;cen&s;ion; and though I could not wholly divert my&s;elf of the prejudice of my fir&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I had at lea&s;t the impartiality to condemn my&s;elf for it.</P>
<P>I hope you did not wait dinner for me, Lady Mary, cried &s;he, after the fir&s;t compliments were over, for my good friend was rather indi&s;po&s;ed, and &s;o anxious for my &s;tay, that I found it would have been unkind to have refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>I did not expect your Lady&s;hip, re|turned Lady Mary, and now that you are returned I ought not to regret your ab&s;ence, as to that alone I owe the com|pany of another vi&s;itor, who has only fa|voured me with it becau&s;e my coach was not to be had to carry her home. Pray give me leave, Mi&s;s Seymour, added &s;he, to have the plea&s;ure of in|troducing you to Lady Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>I coloured at the introduction. But
<PB N="219" REF="222">
Lady Linro&s;e, with much politene&s;s and no change of countenance, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be happy to have the honour of knowing me, and hoped her having the carriage had been no very material inconvenience to me.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dudley, however, to whom I un|derwent the &s;ame ceremony, only half bowing to my curt&s;ey, &s;tared me in the face with evident curio&s;ity, and a look of &s;upercilious ea&s;e which wholly di&s;con|certed me.</P>
<P>She is by no means plain; but a look of con&s;cious &s;uperiority renders her fea|tures determinedly unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>My accident, for which Lady Linro&s;e te&s;tified much regret and concern, fur|ni&s;hed conver&s;ation for the fir&s;t quarter of an hour: but her open and unre&s;erved affability immediately convinced me that no &s;u&s;picion had ari&s;en in her mind on hearing my name, and her manner was &s;o totally oppo&s;ite from what I expected
<PB N="220" REF="223">
to have found it, that in &s;pite of my long cheri&s;hed re&s;entment I could not avoid feeling delighted to perceive the mother of Roat&s;ley &s;o much more amia|ble than I had conceived po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Relieved from my alarm of being known, I flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould &s;oon grow more compo&s;ed: but ah! Sophia, remained there not yet &s;ufficient to di&s;|turb and di&s;tre&s;s me? Lady Elizabeth! to meet with her, and in a party &s;o gay, where the relations on both &s;ides &s;eemed met to rejoice over the approaching union which was &s;oon to cement their friend&s;hip and intimacy by &s;till &s;tronger ties! Oh how &s;unk, dejected, and di&s;pi|rited did I feel.</P>
<P>The company were not yet &s;at down to cards, but continued chatting during a &s;hort interval which &s;ucceeded to the entrance of Lady Linro&s;e and her daugh|ter, when the door opened, and Mr. Howard, who anxious to relieve Fanny's
<PB N="221" REF="224">
apprehen&s;ions, had &s;et off in defiance of the inclemency of the evening, was an|nounced.</P>
<P>Lady Mary received him with the kindne&s;s and familiarity due to an old friend, (for I find they have been long acquainted), and congratulated him on my fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ety, which I give you my word, &s;aid &s;he, you chiefly owe to me; for &s;o eager was Mi&s;s Seymour to return home, that I was obliged to exert the authority which above forty years &s;eniority has given me over her, to prevent her ri&s;k|ing her neck upon that horrid hor&s;e of your's, which I hope you will di&s;po&s;e of in all ha&s;te.</P>
<P>My joy at &s;eeing Mr. Howard, who was equally delighted to find me &s;o &s;lightly hurt, drove Lady Linro&s;e for an in&s;tant from my mind. The idea &s;oon recurred, however, when on turning round, I perceived the alteration which his unexpected appearance had produced
<PB N="222" REF="225">
on her countenance. A look of gloom, a&s;toni&s;hment, and vexation, were there predominant; and a flu&s;h of embarra&s;&s;|ment tinged her cheeks. The truth &s;eemed at once to have fla&s;hed upon her mind. Mr. Howard, &s;he well knew; and my name had been repeated to her &s;o often from his lips, that no doubt could remain. She &s;eemed for a mo|ment confounded and irre&s;olute, but on Lady Mary's pre&s;enting Mr. Howard to her, &s;he appeared &s;uddenly to recollect her&s;elf and received him as an utter &s;tranger, whom &s;he had never before beheld, with a cold formality not untinc|tured with hauteur.</P>
<P>He on his part, finding her de&s;ign was to affect ignorance, bowed with po|lite di&s;tance, and continued to chat with his u&s;ual ea&s;e to Lady Mary.</P>
<P>From the moment of his appearance, Lady Linro&s;e kept a profound &s;ilence. She often glanced upon me an eye of
<PB N="223" REF="226">
&s;crutiny as if by &s;tealth, and her looks were by no means expre&s;&s;ive of &s;atisfac|tion: but the in&s;tant I &s;eemed to remark her notice, &s;he withdrew it and employed her&s;elf very bu&s;ily at her knitting, which &s;he entangled and di&s;entangled uncea&s;|ingly with much ingenuity.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing entreaties, in&s;i&s;ted on returning home, though the evening was damp and cold. I would have given the world to have accompanied him; but finding the propo&s;al would be received with great oppo&s;ition, I prevailed on my&s;elf to &s;ay nothing, Lady Mary promi&s;ing her&s;elf to accompany me to Hubert Hill in the morning.</P>
<P>After he was gone, the company di|vided into little parties. Tho&s;e who preferred cards, &s;at down to the card ta|ble, while mo&s;t of the young people &s;eemed more inclined to chat.</P>
<P>All the gentlemen, Sir Edward and
<PB N="224" REF="227">
Captain Brad&s;haw excepted, flocked around Lady Elizabeth's chair. They &s;eemed indeed mo&s;t zealous in their de|voirs, and attached them&s;elves wholly to her; li&s;tening with delight to every little &s;ally which levity drew from her lips, while &s;he received their homage with a pride &s;he took but little pains to conceal. Oh! my Sophia, from this &s;evere ex|pre&s;&s;ion, are you not afraid that my un|fortunate partiality has given birth to the wor&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions, envy and inju&s;tice. Di&s;appointment, by calling forth our powers of exertion, is generally thought to improve the heart; but I fear you will conclude my mortifications have had a very different effect on mine. Believe me, however, my dear, when I &s;olemnly declare that tho&s;e mean pa&s;&s;ions are far from having influenced me in my repre|&s;entation of Lady Elizabeth. Had her manners po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that poli&s;hed dignity, or her conver&s;ation that una&s;&s;uming good
<PB N="225" REF="228">
&s;en&s;e, which from the choice of Mr. Roat&s;ley I could not but expect, be a&s;|&s;ured I &s;hould have admired with un|prejudiced eyes the woman of his heart: but oh! how oppo&s;ite did I conceive that woman to be from what I find her. How plea&s;ed, how gratified did &s;he not &s;eem with the flattery and attention of the gentlemen pre&s;ent; who really, as far as one day's acquaintance could ena|ble me to judge, appeared uncommonly in&s;ipid in their conver&s;ation, and far from engaging in their addre&s;s. But pro|bably they &s;uffered not a little from the compari&s;on my thoughts were continu|ally drawing between them and another, ah! how infinitely their &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Ought I not to regard this marriage as a material fault in Mr. Roat&s;ley's charac|ter: for that his chief, if not his only aim in it is fortune, I cannot help being convinced; and is it not an unpardona|ble error to prize the advantages of &s;plen|dour
<PB N="226" REF="229">
&s;o highly, and to hold dome&s;tic happine&s;s in &s;o low e&s;timation. Yet I ought not to judge thus har&s;hly. We know not a thou&s;and circum&s;tances which may render this match not only laudable but meritorious; and of Lady Elizabeth I merely form my opinion from the ob&s;er|vation of a few hours, where the little de|fects of addre&s;s mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed wholly to have influenced my judgment. Erro|neous as this mode of conclu&s;ion may be, yet the manner &s;o generally be&s;peaks the character, that where the one is informed and intelligent, the other &s;eldom or ne|ver appears trifling or di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>But to return to the company. Lady Linro&s;e being engaged at whi&s;t, &s;till pre|&s;erved towards me the cold di&s;tance &s;he had a&s;&s;umed &s;ince Mr. Howard's appear|ance, and addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me no more during the remainder of the even|ing. Her elde&s;t daughter &s;eemed lan|guid and out of &s;pirits, and at length
<PB N="227" REF="230">
took up a book, in which however &s;he only occa&s;ionally looked, often recurring to the inve&s;tigation of my figure, which appeared much the mo&s;t amu&s;ing em|ployment of the two; for &s;he examined me &s;ometimes for minutes together with no great cordiality in her countenance, and with entire di&s;regard to the unea&s;i|ne&s;s it gave me. Lady Elizabeth was &s;oon per&s;uaded to retire to the next apartment, where &s;he was &s;olicited to play on the organ, which induced almo&s;t all the company to follow her. Mi&s;s Lucy Dudley, however, &s;eeing me di&s;|engaged and &s;ilent, kindly re&s;umed her &s;eat on a &s;opha; where, with Sir Edward and Mr. Brad&s;haw, we made a &s;ort of di&s;tinct cotterie, and began to chat very agreeably together.</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e, who appeared to re|mark with di&s;plea&s;ure her daughter's at|tention to me, &s;oon called her to look over her cards, and kept her by her &s;ide
<PB N="228" REF="231">
the re&s;t of the evening; and a me&s;&s;age from the mu&s;ic room &s;oon after reque&s;t|ing Sir Edward to accompany on the flute Lady Elizabeth's voice in a &s;ong, unwillingly obliging him to leave the drawing room, Mr. Brad&s;haw and I were left in a manner tete a tete on the &s;opha. I found him agreeable and intelligent, attended with a certain bluntne&s;s of man|ner which rather in&s;pired the idea of &s;in|cerity than rudene&s;s, and we &s;oon entered into a mo&s;t intere&s;ting conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;aid he, may I a&s;k your opinion of Lady Elizabeth. She is univer&s;ally followed and admired; yet I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting that her &s;plendid fortune and brilliant pro&s;pects have contributed full as much to place her &s;o high in the li&s;ts of beauty as any intrin&s;ic charms &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; but I make no doubt you will not agree in my opinion, for I know on this &s;ubject it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould talk according to con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="232">Why &s;o, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it is wholly but of nature for one fine woman to give her genuine &s;en|timents of another.</P>
<P>Do you then imagine envy &s;o univer|&s;ally prevalent.</P>
<P>By no means. I only believe that the terror of &s;uch an imputation induces every hand&s;ome female to be&s;tow upon another encomiums infinitely beyond her private opinion.</P>
<P>To prove my &s;incerity, &s;aid I, I will acknowledge, that Lady Elizabeth, tho' undoubtedly a fine looking woman, is le&s;s &s;o than from report I expected to find her.</P>
<P>Had &s;he tru&s;ted to nature, returned he, &s;he might have merited the appella|tion you give her; but affectation and coquetry will di&s;tort the fine&s;t features, and produce awkwardne&s;s where we ought to admire grace.</P>
<P>That the friend of Mr. Roat&s;ley &s;hould
<PB N="230" REF="233">
expre&s;s to a &s;tranger, with &s;o little re|&s;erve, an opinion &s;o unfavourable of the woman who was &s;oon to be united to him, &s;urprized me not a little, and I could only account for it by &s;uppo&s;ing that her coqueti&s;h behaviour had pro|voked him &s;o much as to put him out of all patience and had rendered his pru|dence off its guard.</P>
<P>I thought, &s;aid I, all her little follies of that &s;ort were &s;oon to have a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion, repeated he, in a voice of undi&s;gui&s;ed di&s;plea&s;ure; not &s;o long as youth and good looks remain, I'll be &s;worn; at lea&s;t if we may judge of the future by the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I thought Lady Elizabeth had been on the verge of matrimony, &s;aid I, with as much compo&s;ure as I could a&s;&s;ume, yet trembling to hear it confirmed from authority &s;o indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>And pray can you, Mi&s;s Seymour,
<PB N="231" REF="234">
who have pa&s;&s;ed part of the winter in town, pretend to imagine that matri|mony, to a vain woman, excludes the attentions of a crowd of followers.</P>
<P>Your reproof of my ignorance is ju&s;t, &s;aid I, (attempting to &s;mile, though in|wardly depre&s;&s;ed by an an&s;wer &s;o un&s;atis|factory and eva&s;ive, and which yet ta|citly acknowledged the truth of Lady Elizabeth's engagement) but I was little in company, had few acquaintance, and &s;pent my time chiefly at home in a very &s;ober dome&s;tic family.</P>
<P>Yes, we could not conceive where you had hid your&s;elf, for you were to be &s;een no where. It was at one time con|cluded that you mu&s;t have left town.</P>
<P>That was exactly the ca&s;e, returned I.</P>
<P>Not <HI>exactly,</HI> for I think you did not go till the beginning of March.</P>
<P>I could not avoid being rather &s;ur|pri&s;ed, on finding Mr. Brad&s;haw, with whom I had had when in town not the
<PB N="232" REF="235">
&s;lighte&s;t intercour&s;e or acquaintance, &s;o well informed of my motions; and read|ing my thoughts from a tran&s;ient ex|pre&s;&s;ion in my countenance&mdash;you are a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;aid he, &s;miling, to find me &s;o accurate in this point; but I believe you would be &s;till more &s;o were I to inform you how long I have had the ho|nour of con&s;idering my&s;elf intimately ac|quainted with you, though entirely with|out your knowledge or participation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e, cried I, laughing, and al&s;o my regret, that I &s;hould have been &s;o fortunate without knowing it.</P>
<P>O, in regard to Mi&s;s Seymour, I give you my word I am extremely intelligent.</P>
<P>I began faintly to &s;u&s;pect from whence this information had been derived, and to flatter my&s;elf that it might have owed its origin to Roat&s;ley's &s;olicitude. This idea produced an anxiety beyond mea|&s;ure potent, to draw &s;ome &s;oothing par|ticulars
<PB N="233" REF="236">
from his friend; but as if eager to excite a curio&s;ity be meant not to gra|tify&mdash;perhaps, cried he, you might be no le&s;s &s;urprized were you to know that I was in con&s;tant pur&s;uit of you all the beginning of the winter; nay, and what is yet more wonderful and perplexing, I do not claim either merit to my&s;elf or gratitude from you, for the indefatigable pains and indu&s;try I employed in hunting after you at every place of amu&s;ement where it was probable you might appear.</P>
<P>It is very wonderful indeed, cried I, &s;ecretly delighted, nor could I ever have &s;u&s;pected, &s;tranger as I found my&s;elf in this country, that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any friends &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in me to be &s;olici|tous how or where I pa&s;&s;ed my time.</P>
<P>O, cried he with an inve&s;tigating look that &s;eemed to penetrate into what effect his words might produce, nature has been &s;o bountifully profu&s;e to &s;ome of her happy favorites, as to endow them
<PB N="234" REF="237">
with the gift of creating friends by a <HI>coup d'oeil</HI>&mdash;friends, who exi&s;t but in their &s;ight, who live but on their &s;miles, and who watch with unwearied patience and a&s;&s;iduity, every opportunity for a meet|ing which indulgent fortune may throw in their way: friends, who develope at one glance, and adore almo&s;t in an in|&s;tant, tho&s;e virtues and excellencies which in common mortals require inti|macy, inve&s;tigation, and length of time, to expand and di&s;cover them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Vague as were the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, a dawning ray of hope led me to give them an interpretation &s;o con&s;cious, as covered me with blu&s;hes. I knew not what re|ply to make; and the earne&s;t look with, which he evidently tried to develope my thoughts, compleated my embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>I am quite in the dark, cried I at length, and cannot conceive at what you aim.</P>
<P>So I perceive, &s;aid he with a &s;atyrical
<PB N="235" REF="238">
&s;mile; but I intreat that my words may not throw you into any perplexity. I &s;hould be mi&s;erable, were your re&s;t to|night to be di&s;turbed from a fruitle&s;s at|tempt to unriddle my my&s;terious oracles.</P>
<P>I believe my re&s;t will not be ea&s;ily in|terrupted this night, replied I with a carele&s;s air, for my fatigues, or rather my alarm, has exhau&s;ted me a good deal, and I feel quite drow&s;y and &s;tupid.</P>
<P>Perceiving the gravity with which I &s;poke, Mr. Brad&s;haw in&s;tantly-a&s;&s;umed a more re&s;erved behaviour, and &s;hifting the di&s;cour&s;e to other topics, I di&s;covered that he had not gone into the country at the time I imagined, from the private conver&s;ation I overheard, nor for &s;ome weeks after. "I was &s;everal times un|der the apprehen&s;ion of recruiting orders, &s;aid he, but received a longer reprieve than I had dared flatter my&s;elf with the hopes of obtaining.</P>
<P>The card party having now concluded
<PB N="236" REF="239">
their rubbers, and Lady Elizabeth, with her &s;uite of attendants, being returned into the drawing room, a period was put to our conver&s;ation. But it left the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, and at &s;upper I could not help &s;ecretly wi&s;hing that Mr. Brad&s;haw might be placed next me. In this however I was di&s;appointed; for Sir Edward betrayed an anxiety &s;o eager to procure a &s;eat next mine, that the other with a grave bow gave way to him.</P>
<P>At this little manoeuvre Lady Eliza|beth appeared by no means plea&s;ed. In|deed nothing could be more pointed than the haughtine&s;s of her manner to me the whole evening. A coquet, it would ap|pear, expects the exclu&s;ive privilege of enjoying the homage of every man who beholds her; for tho' the re&s;t of the gen|tlemen, Mr. Brad&s;haw excepted, attend|ed her with the mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;iduity, the mortification &s;he experienced in finding
<PB N="237" REF="240">
this devotion was not unanimous, evi|dently hurt and corroded her. Whether the meanne&s;s of my equipage, and the humility of my abode, at the <HI>little whtie hou&s;e on the hill,</HI> increa&s;ed her indignation, I know not, but &s;he regarded me with looks of contempt, and behaved to Sir Edward with &s;o much childi&s;h ill hu|mour, that I began at length to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome &s;ecret partiality mu&s;t have produced a conduct for which mere &s;elfi&s;h vanity &s;eemed an inadequate cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;ullen behaviour of Lady Eliza|beth, the cold di&s;tance of Lady Linro&s;e, and the imperious di&s;regard of her elde&s;t daughter, added to my being con&s;cious how di&s;agreeable my pre&s;ence, tho' from very different motives, mu&s;t prove to them all, made me feel beyond mea&s;ure uncomfortable; and the painful weight which lay heavy at my heart, and wholly depre&s;&s;ed my &s;pirits, made Sir Edward's conver&s;ation not merely unplea&s;ant but
<PB N="238" REF="241">
irk&s;ome to me; e&s;pecially as my &s;u&s;pi|cion of Lady Elizabeth's attachment was &s;trengthened and confirmed every in&s;tant by her increa&s;ing unea&s;ine&s;s. When I con&s;idered however how inferior Sir Ed|ward was in all points to his competitor, it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to conceive that caprice, or folly it&s;elf, could be blind to the &s;triking difference between them.</P>
<P>The cordial intimacy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the two families, and indeed in|cluded all pre&s;ent but my&s;elf, not only ex|cluded me from all &s;hare of the conver|&s;ation, which I was far from regretting, but made me feel awkward, as well as mi&s;erable. Lady Mary indeed often ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me with peculiar civili|ty; but as I was placed at a di&s;tance from her, politene&s;s did not compen&s;ate for the rude neglect of her niece.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation happening to turn on re&s;emblances, I think, &s;aid Sir Edward, I never beheld a more &s;triking likene&s;s
<PB N="239" REF="242">
than the profiles of Mi&s;s Lucy Dudley and Mi&s;s Seymour exhibit at this mo|ment. I have been con&s;idering them on each &s;ide of me for &s;ome time, with al|mo&s;t an equal mixture of wonder and admiration.</P>
<P>A likene&s;s! repeated Mi&s;s Dudley. I mu&s;t acknowledge I &s;carce ever beheld two faces in my opinion more oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>I am extremely &s;orry to differ from you, Madam, returned he; but I &s;till dare ap|peal to the company if my remark is not ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Strikingly &s;o indeed, cried Lady Ma|ry; tho' till it was mentioned I own I was not &s;en&s;ible of the re&s;emblance. But in &s;pite of the difference of complex|ion it is really remarkable. Don't your Lady&s;hip think &s;o, added &s;he, turning to Lady Linro&s;e?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, returned her Lady&s;hip, with a cold, embarra&s;&s;ed air, I am of
<PB N="240" REF="243">
Caroline's opinion: I cannot perceive the likene&s;s.</P>
<P>Good heavens! cried Caroline, how &s;hould there be any. The eyes of the one are black, and Lucy's are quite blue.</P>
<P>I did not &s;peak of the eyes of the two ladies, but of their profiles, &s;aid Sir Ed|ward. There is even &s;omewhat in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of countenance &s;o much alike, that had I never before been in company with either, I &s;hould have concluded them nearly related.</P>
<P>What effect the&s;e words produced in the countenances of Lady Linro&s;e and her daughters, I had not re&s;olution to examine, and con&s;cious confu&s;ion made me keep my eyes fixed on the table; from which however I &s;oon rai&s;ed them in a&s;toni&s;hment on hearing Lady Linro&s;e &s;ay, you pay my daughter a very unme|rited compliment by the compari&s;on, Sir Edward, and really now you put it into my head, I don't know but there is &s;ome
<PB N="241" REF="244">
&s;ort of likene&s;s, e&s;pecially in the under part of the face: and &s;oon after, when we were &s;eparating for the night, her La|dy&s;hip wi&s;hed me a good night with par|ticular civility and affability.</P>
<P>Confounded with the various events of the day, the moment I found my&s;elf a|lone in the chamber allotted me, I threw my&s;elf into a chair, and gave way to a train of reflections, which &s;o wholly over|powered me, as to bani&s;h all de&s;ire of &s;leep. I could not but admire the &s;ingu|larity of that chance, which had conduc|ted me &s;o &s;trangely into the mid&s;t of my relations, and to the party which of all others I wi&s;hed the mo&s;t to avoid; while I knew that my pre&s;ence, by overwhelm|ing them with confu&s;ion and embarra&s;&s;|ment, mu&s;t prove &s;till more di&s;agreeable to them than to my&s;elf. Lady Elizabeth too&mdash;to feel all my half-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed emo|tions animated and renewed by this un|expected
<PB N="242" REF="245">
and unwi&s;hed for rencontre, ah! Sophia! don't you pity me?</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing a very re&s;tle&s;s night, I found my foot &s;o much wor&s;e, that walking even into the next room was al|mo&s;t impracticable. I therefore &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Lady Mary by her maid, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to dre&s;s, intimating that if her Lady&s;hip would give me leave, I &s;hould breakfa&s;t in my own apartment, where I wi&s;hed to remain till the carriage was ordered to carry me home. By this means I avoided &s;eeing any of the com|pany, whom I really dreaded encounter|ing at breakfa&s;t, after the perturbation of the preceding day. I regretted how|ever, that in e&s;caping from the others, I mu&s;t be deprived of &s;eeing Mr. Brad|&s;haw, who&s;e my&s;terious di&s;cour&s;e it mu&s;t be owned a&s;toni&s;hed though it did not perplex me, and formed no incon&s;idera|ble portion of my reflexions during the night.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="246">Lady Mary entered my chamber &s;oon after, and made a thou&s;and kind enqui|ries re&s;pecting my health. She informed me that Lady Linro&s;e was confined to bed with a headach, and that Mr. Brad|&s;haw had &s;et off for his quarters two hours before breakfa&s;t: and after kindly di&s;approving of my imprudence in ven|turing home, told me, &s;ince I was deter|mined to go, &s;he &s;hould her&s;elf &s;ee me &s;afe to Hubert Hill, as &s;he wi&s;hed to take the earlie&s;t opportunity of waiting on Mrs. Howard.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Lucy Dudley was likewi&s;e &s;o obliging as to pay me a vi&s;it before I left Holtenham. While &s;he &s;at with me in my chamber, Lady Mary again entered. I think an airing will be of &s;ervice to you, my dear, &s;aid &s;he to her, after your late confinement. Pray will you accom|pany me to Mrs. Howard's. Her hu&s;|band is an old friend of mine, and I po&s;|&s;e&s;s few or none I re&s;pect &s;o highly.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="247">With all my heart, my dear Madam, cried &s;he; and having &s;ent the maid for her hat, we immediately proceeded down &s;tairs, which was to me a very difficult undertaking and one that I did not ac|compli&s;h without great pain, though I had an a&s;&s;i&s;tant on each hand.</P>
<P>When we entered the hall, we were met by Lady Elizabeth and Mi&s;s Dud|ley. The former, with a reluctant bow, hoped I was well: and the other, with|out even vouch&s;afing me that civility, ha&s;tily called out&mdash;Lucy, where are you going?</P>
<P>I mean to accompany Lady Mary and Mi&s;s Seymour. The day is fine, and an airing will be agreeable.</P>
<P>I believe Mamma will not allow of your going, &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Why &s;o.</P>
<P>Nay, I &s;hall go a&s;k her: and in&s;tantly returning, &s;aid&mdash;Mamma does not chu&s;e
<PB N="245" REF="248">
you &s;hould ri&s;k taking cold by airing to|day Lucy.</P>
<P>Lord how odd, when it is the &s;weete&s;t weather in the world.</P>
<P>O there is no chance of cold in &s;uch a morning, cried Lady Mary. It will do her good I'm convinced.</P>
<P>It is Mamma's commands, &s;aid Mi&s;s Caroline gravely; and although the &s;weet Lucy went her&s;elf to &s;olicit, &s;he came back di&s;appointed. I am very &s;orry, &s;aid &s;he, taking my hand, that I cannot have the plea&s;ure of your company a lit|tle longer; but I hope Lady Mary will vi&s;it at Hubert Hill more than once while we remain at Holtenham, and I &s;hall mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be of the party next time.</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e, you perceive, adheres with con&s;cientious integrity to her pro|mi&s;e of debarring all intercour&s;e between her family and ours. Angry as I am, there is &s;omewhat in her manners &s;o in&s;i|nuating,
<PB N="246" REF="249">
that I cannot &s;o cordially blame her conduct as I did before I &s;aw her: nay what is &s;till more &s;trange, I cannot avoid &s;ugge&s;ting excu&s;es for her beha|viour; and even feel &s;omewhat &s;oothing and con&s;olatory in the idea that Roat&s;ley's mother, whom I de&s;ire &s;o much to love and re&s;pect, &s;eems more worthy of the&s;e &s;entiments than I ever imagined &s;he could prove. Her &s;on re&s;embles her extremely, though the expre&s;&s;ion is different.</P>
<P>I believe, Sophia, prejudice and par|tiality blind the eye of judgment &s;o un|accountably, that people are &s;eldom to be tru&s;ted in their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions where a &s;trong and lively intere&s;t is at &s;take. Per|haps we have judged too hardly of this family. To oppo&s;e Lord Belmont in a favourite point, may be to relinqui&s;h all hopes of his favour for ever; and if &s;uch is the inflexibility of his temper Lady Linro&s;e is not &s;o much to blame.</P>

<P>AS my &s;prain &s;till confines me to the &s;opha, and my journal is always my fa|vourite amu&s;ement, I have employed the two la&s;t days almo&s;t con&s;tantly in writing. Indeed I am happy to fly to
<PB N="248" REF="251">
any occupation that has the power of di|viding my thoughts: for my Sophia will ea&s;ily conceive the late incident was but ill calculated for de&s;troying that fatal im|pre&s;&s;ion, which I flattered my&s;elf time and ab&s;ence, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by my mo&s;t vigor|ous exertions, would at length &s;ubdue. Would to heaven the marriage was once finally concluded. When doubt (ab&s;urd as it is to doubt) is converted into cer|tainty, my endeavours I am convinced mu&s;t be &s;ucce&s;sful. I may &s;uffer at fir&s;t, but the&s;e turbulent feelings will abate. At pre&s;ent a thou&s;and circum&s;tances are ever ready to occur to rou&s;e and animate an attachment alas! too in&s;inuating.</P>
<P>How can I account for Roat&s;ley's con|duct, hinted to me by his friend. Oh! my dear, was it indeed Roat&s;ley who oc|ca&s;ioned Mr. Brad&s;haw's re&s;earches? why then his &s;ilence to Mr. Howard's letter; and why, with engagements &s;o &s;erious on his hands, could he allow in
<PB N="249" REF="252">
him&s;elf a &s;olicitude &s;o fruitle&s;s? His con|duct altogether is inexplicable, and the more I attempt to unravel it, the le&s;s my conjectures give me &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Are you not a&s;toni&s;hed, my love, at my repre&s;entation of Lady Elizabeth Sid|ley. Is it po&s;&s;ible to believe Roat&s;ley can make &s;uch a &s;acrifice to fortune. Oh! Sophia! a &s;acrifice to principle I am convinced it mu&s;t be. Duty and per|&s;ua&s;ion have prevailed with him to ac|quie&s;ce in a match on which his family have &s;et their hearts.</P>

<P>I have been vi&s;ited during my confine|ment by the good par&s;on's family, who &s;pent ye&s;terday with us.</P>
<P>Mrs. Heathcote, though unacquainted but by report with Lady Mary Lawrence, told us a thou&s;and little country anec|dotes
<PB N="250" REF="253">
of her, which all proved the good|ne&s;s of her heart and the liberality of her ample pur&s;e; for &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;plendid income, having been left by her late hu&s;band the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of his fortune. This fortune, Mrs. Heathcote &s;aid, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed would center in her neice, Lady Elizabeth Sed|ley, who was not much beloved by the ladies in the neighbourhood, as &s;he uni|formly behaved to them with a con&s;cious &s;uperiority, and imperious re&s;erve, that rendered her company formal and di&s;|gu&s;ting. Indeed, &s;aid &s;he, her Lady&s;hip, I am told, exacts a deference and atten|tion that few are willing to pay; for which rea&s;on there is u&s;ually a party at Holtenham of people of the fir&s;t rank and importance from town, with whom alone Lady Elizabeth will a&s;&s;ociate on a footing of equality.</P>
<P>I ventured to enquire, finding the good woman both intelligent and communi|cative,
<PB N="251" REF="254">
whether or not Lord Linro&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed any property in this part of the country. She believed not, &s;he told me: but &s;ince Mr. Howard had left England, above one half of the e&s;tates around had changed their original proprietors; and my Lord Belmont had lately made two different purcha&s;es of con&s;iderable amount, which had &s;ecured to him a decided par|liamentary intere&s;t in the county. On one of the&s;e e&s;tates, &s;aid &s;he, to which he has given the name of Mount Dudley, and which is not above &s;even miles di&s;|tant, he has built a very elegant though not a very large hou&s;e, and has pre&s;ented it to his favourite grand &s;on Mr. Roat&s;|ley, who however has never lived in it as it has not yet been put in order for a family: but I under&s;tand they are fitting it up in all ha&s;te, and furni&s;hing it very magnificiently for his place of re&s;idence &s;o &s;oon as his marriage is concluded: &s;o
<PB N="252" REF="255">
you will have them for neighbours pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>Is that event &s;oon to take place, de|manded Fanny.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, nobody &s;eems to know. It has been long talked of; and before Mr. Roat&s;ley &s;et out on his tra|vels, every one &s;aid it would happen di|rectly on his return. But it has been whi&s;pered &s;ince his return, that matters are not in &s;uch forwardne&s;s as was ima|gined. The young man's ardour is &s;u&s;|pected to be cooled; nay &s;ome people &s;ay it never was extremely violent; but that when he was very young, and the lady hardly fifteen, there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a childi&s;h attachment between them, which originated entirely on the &s;ide of Lady Elizabeth; and that Lord Belmont, who has been unfortunate in &s;ome of his fa|mily, particularly in the article of ma|trimony, and who was not ea&s;ily recon|ciled to the pre&s;ent Lord Linro&s;e on his
<PB N="253" REF="256">
marriage, although by the death of a dl&s;tant relation her Lady&s;hip has brought him a very con&s;iderable fortune, exacted a promi&s;e, and promoted an engagement between his grand&s;on and this lady, which is intended to be concluded on his Lord&s;hip's return from the Continent.</P>
<P>Lady Elizabeth is much to be pitied, in my opinion, cried Fanny, if with all her &s;plendid advantages of birth and fortune they cannot &s;ecure the heart of the man &s;he has cho&s;en.</P>
<P>I agree with you perfectly, Madam: But I believe ladies of &s;uperior rank and education don't always think in that man|ner; and by what I hear, Lady Eliza|beth is not much calculated for dome&s;tic happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of my &s;ecret anxiety, I for|bore, while Mr. Howard and the re&s;t of the company were pre&s;ent, to prolong the &s;ubject: but finding my &s;elf acciden|tally alone with Mrs. Heathcote, for a
<PB N="254" REF="257">
quarter of an hour after dinner, I artfully renewed the topic of Lady Elizabeth; and &s;he then told me &s;he was intimately connected with the gentlewoman who had &s;uperintended her education as go|verne&s;s, from whence &s;he had drawn the early part of her information. Mr. Roat&s;|ley, &s;aid &s;he, has been I know acquainted with the young lady from infancy. She was his &s;i&s;ter's friend, and had often been his own playfellow. It is not improbable therefore that her infantine attachment had produced in him a return of affection before he went abroad that might par|take more of gratitude than pa&s;&s;ion. It mu&s;t be owned Lady Elizabeth has but ill an&s;wered the fond expectations of her family; and probably he finds him&s;elf di&s;appointed, after &s;everal years ab&s;ence. But there is no tru&s;ting to report. It is very certain however that he has not once vi&s;ited at Holtenham &s;ince his arri|val; though, owing to Lady Mary's in|di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="255" REF="258">
the family only pa&s;&s;ed a very few weeks this winter in town. They &s;ay Lady Elizabeth is much offended at the coolne&s;s of his a&s;&s;iduities, and that there is a very formidable rival, Sir Ed|ward Sudbury, in the way, who is much in favour with her Lady&s;hip at pre&s;ent, but I dare &s;ay there is nothing in it.</P>
<P>All this accounts a little, Sophia, for Captain Brad&s;haw's in&s;inuations.</P>

<P>To-day I have ventured to take a &s;hort walk, and am con&s;iderably better. We have had compliments of enquiry from Lady Mary after my health more than once.</P>
<P>We have been rather unea&s;y at not hearing from our dear, dear Lady Au|brey all this while; and we now find we have had but too much rea&s;on for appre|hen&s;ion:
<PB N="256" REF="259">
alas! &s;he has had a relap&s;e; but thank God not an alarming one. She is now, &s;he tells us, in the kinde&s;t of letters which we received this morn|ing, quite recovered, and has got Sir William and Lady Meredith with her at the ca&s;tle. I find my&s;elf &s;ettled here, &s;ays &s;he, much to my &s;atisfaction. The ancient architecture of my abode has nei|ther bani&s;hed light, nor precluded cheer|fulne&s;s; and I am determined its gran|deur &s;hall on no account be fettered with &s;tate or parade. My mind begins to partake of the tranquility around me; and I am enabled my&s;elf to ta&s;te that comfort which an overgrown and other|wi&s;e u&s;ele&s;s fortune allows me the privi|lege of di&s;pen&s;ing to others. But when &s;hall my ri&s;ing &s;atisfaction receive its full completion in the dear &s;ociety of my be|loved children? when &s;hall I again fold them to my heart, and receive, in tears of heartfelt plea&s;ure, a compen&s;ation for
<PB N="257" REF="260">
tho&s;e of bitterne&s;s and mi&s;ery which have flowed with &s;uch profu&s;ion from my eyes? I will not however &s;often your feeling hearts into a ha&s;ty compliance with my wi&s;hes, which may not prove, ju&s;t at this time, wholly convenient to the wor|thy Mr. Howard. I will tru&s;t to your affection to expedite your vi&s;it as &s;oon as you can, and till I enjoy the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you, do not fear that I am either &s;olitary or de&s;ponding; no, on the con|trary, be a&s;&s;ured I am grateful, con|tented, and happy. I have at pre&s;ent the plea&s;ure of Sir William and my dear aunt's company, who will not leave me for &s;ome time. My doors are never &s;hut again&s;t tho&s;e in my neighbourhood who favour me with their vi&s;its, without exacting a &s;crupulous return; and my mind is at ea&s;e while I re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of the love and attachment of tho&s;e clear and amiable children who are &s;o entirely po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of mine.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="261">Dear and ever valued Lady Aubrey! With what delight &s;hall we fulfil our promi&s;e. Mr. Howard's bu&s;ine&s;s will detain him a fortnight longer: but I have written that if any more delays in|tervene, and my &s;i&s;ter continues well, I &s;hall undoubtedly make the journey by my&s;elf.</P>

<P>I WILL not anticipate, Sophia. But why is fortune &s;o indu&s;trious in throwing accidents in my way which prove the ut|mo&s;t exertion of my re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="262">Ye&s;terday Mi&s;s Patty Heathcote walk|ed up in the morning, to inform us that a &s;et of &s;troling players had lately ar|rived in the little village near us; that they had fitted up their theatre in a barn, where for &s;ome preceding evenings they had performed &s;ome of the be&s;t plays, much to the &s;atisfaction, &s;aid &s;he inno|cently, of <HI>very excellent judges</HI>; and that as neither &s;he nor her mother had ever &s;een a play, they would take it as a <HI>pro|digious favour indeed</HI> if Mr. and Mrs. Howard and I would do them the ho|nour to go and make a party with them.</P>
<P>The little girl's eyes, while &s;he deli|vered this me&s;&s;age, &s;parkled with an ea|gerne&s;s which per&s;uaded Mr. Howard at once to agree to the mea&s;ure, and made me really anxious for its &s;ucce&s;s; and Fanny, who with the &s;edate character of a &s;ober married woman pre&s;erves all the innocent eagerne&s;s of &s;eventeen, is al|ways
<PB N="260" REF="263">
&s;o much delighted with any frolic, that &s;he was de&s;irous of going the in&s;tant it was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>As the village is &s;carce a mile and an half di&s;tant, and it was bright moon light, it was agreed that the whole party &s;hould walk to and from the theatre, concluding that the performance would not detain us very late; my&s;elf excepted, whom Mr. Howard in&s;i&s;ted on carrying thither in his little equipage, as walking, after my late accident, might prove hurtful, my foot, though almo&s;t well, being &s;till weak. Mi&s;s Patty ran full &s;peed down the hill, breathle&s;s with ex|pectation to equip her&s;elf for the play|hou&s;e, and to reque&s;t that her father and mother and all the children old enough to accompany them, would a&s;&s;emble at Hubert Hill to dinner, from whence we &s;hould all &s;et off together.</P>
<P>The labours of the toilet are little known in the rural world; and Nature
<PB N="261" REF="264">
has &s;o lavi&s;hly decked this happy inno|cent family with ro&s;y cheeks, &s;parkling eyes, and &s;miling countenances, that they are as unnece&s;&s;ary as unknown. An hour after, we beheld the good par|&s;on and his wife a&s;cending the hill, fol|lowed by five of their children; and no ma&s;ked ball or birth night a&s;&s;embly ever occa&s;ioned more entertainment and de|light than did this excur&s;ion to our ru&s;tic theatre.</P>
<P>We &s;et off at half pa&s;t four, for the children would not cea&s;e teizing us till we were on foot; and having arrived a full hour too &s;oon, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the front bench, which in this play hou&s;e might be denominated the &s;tage boxes, being the mo&s;t convenient place in the barn for &s;eeing the performance.</P>
<P>We had not been long &s;eated, before &s;everal gentlemen entered, the mo&s;t of whom by their dre&s;s appeared to be officers. Mi&s;s Patty informed me they
<PB N="262" REF="265">
belonged to a company at pre&s;ent quar|tered in the village; but as the place was but indifferently lighted up it was not ea&s;y immediately to di&s;tingui&s;h their faces.</P>
<P>They had not engaged my attention above a few moments, when my com|panion, Mi&s;s Patty, a&s;ked me in a whi&s;|per if I did not think that gentleman in the dark coloured coat, the hand&s;ome&s;t young man I had ever &s;een; and turning to where &s;he pointed, I beheld Mr. Roat&s;|ley leaning again&s;t one of the &s;ide &s;cenes, engaged in conver&s;ation with &s;ome gen|tlemen.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine I was in a tre|mor; and I had not an in&s;tant given me to compo&s;e or recollect my&s;elf, when I perceived Mr. Brad&s;haw approach him, and gently pulling him by the arm, whi&s;|per &s;omething in his ear, which made him at once change colour and glance his eyes with eagerne&s;s around the hou&s;e.
<PB N="263" REF="266">
Captain Brad&s;haw ju&s;t then made me a re&s;pectful bow; and his friend taking the reference of his look, in&s;tantly followed his example, with an expre&s;&s;ion in his countenance of &s;atisfaction and delight which I fear almo&s;t conveyed equal plea|&s;ure into mine. He came directly up to me, and paid me his compliments with a politene&s;s not however unmixed with confu&s;ion; while on my part, the recollection of Mrs. Hindon's letter, the obligation for which my avowed acknow|ledgements were due, and the &s;ecret hu|miliating benefit I knew he had intended to be&s;tow, threw an awkwardne&s;s and con&s;traint over my reception of him which I could not for &s;ome time either conquer or conceal.</P>
<P>Happily Mr. Howard immediately joined us; and by addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Roat&s;ley, gave me a momentary relief. Perceiving I &s;eemed at a lo&s;s, he partly comprehended the cau&s;e; and kindly
<PB N="264" REF="267">
paved the way for my acknowledgments by entering at once on the &s;ubject. I did my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of writing to you, Mr. Roat&s;ley, &s;aid he, &s;ome time ago, but as I have not been favoured with an an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have failed mo&s;t certainly in &s;eizing the earlie&s;t opportunity of ac|knowledging any letter of your's, returned he, had I been con&s;cious of the favour; but I have been making a little excur&s;ion of late, and having no fixed abode, I &s;up|po&s;e they knew not where to forward my letters, as I was &s;o negligent as to leave no orders about them.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, had you really been guilty of any omi&s;&s;ion, no apology was nece&s;&s;ary to me: for I acted but as amanuen&s;is to my fair &s;i&s;ter: and my letter was only intended to expre&s;s her acknowledgments added to my own, for the polite attention with which you have intere&s;ted your&s;elf in her affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="268">A deep blu&s;h over&s;pread the counte|nance of Mr. Roat&s;ley at this &s;peech, and an embarra&s;&s;ment took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his features little inferior to my own when I added, that he mu&s;t have con|cluded me extremely ungrateful to have &s;o long deferred returning my very &s;in|cere thanks, for an obligation which &s;hould always induce me to con&s;ider my|&s;elf as particularly indebted to him.</P>
<P>His confu&s;ion was now augmented; and bowing, he &s;tammered not a little while he repeated&mdash;what plea&s;ure he mu&s;t receive&mdash;how delighted he mu&s;t be&mdash;and how happy he &s;hould think him|&s;elf to be of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ervice to Mi&s;s Seymour.</P>
<P>He then turned to addre&s;s him&s;elf to Mr. Brad&s;haw as if anxious to change the &s;ubject; and ju&s;t at that in&s;tant per|ceiving my &s;i&s;ter, for whom he had not even enquired, he left me to pay his compliments to her; but &s;oon returning,
<PB N="266" REF="269">
he entered immediately on a new topic, enquired how I had amu&s;ed my&s;elf in the country during the winter, a&s;ked if I could really leave town at that gay &s;ea|&s;on without the &s;lighte&s;t regret, and placed him&s;elf next me, where there happened fortunately to be a vacant &s;eat. His l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te confu&s;ion now gave way to a gaiety and animation which convinced me that the ceremony of di&s;tant and oc|ca&s;ional meetings had not hitherto al|lowed of that ea&s;y intimacy between us which developes without con&s;traint or di&s;gui&s;e the real temper of mind. My con&s;cious feelings had always thrown a re&s;erve over my own manner to Mr. Roat&s;ley, which could not fail to affect his; but the unexpected &s;atisfaction of this &s;udden rencontre had given to both a flow of &s;pirits that would not be re|&s;trained, and which while it wholly ba|ni&s;hed Lady Elizabeth Sedley from my recollection pre&s;ented Roat&s;ley in a point
<PB N="267" REF="270">
of view entirely new and &s;till more in&s;i|nuating. I had before admired him as a character of real and una&s;&s;uming dignity. The amiable &s;oftne&s;s of his addre&s;s had charmed me; and all I &s;aw, and all I heard of his di&s;po&s;ition, (however com|bated at times by pique and di&s;plea&s;ure) had &s;erved but to augment my e&s;teem. I had con&s;idered him as rather of a grave turn of mind: this evening however, the early part of it at lea&s;t, fully &s;atisfied me of my error. He was not merely in good &s;pirits, but lively and animated beyond mea&s;ure, and his friend Captain Brad|&s;haw, who joined us, and who really is a very agreeable young man, added to the gaiety and life of the party.</P>
<P>The commencement of the play, which by the way was King Lear, put a period for a &s;hort time to this general chat. But the performance was &s;o mi&s;erable, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to pay attention to it, and Mr. Roat&s;ley again addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in
<PB N="268" REF="271">
conver&s;ation to me. He &s;oon recurred to my leaving town, and talked of it with the mo&s;t flattering regret. I &s;hall not do you the inju&s;tice to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid he, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in your&s;elf tho&s;e never failing re&s;ources which give defiance to vapours and ennui, you could either en|dure much regret on leaving the mere amu&s;ements of the town, or &s;uffer from vacancy or languor on returning to the country; but early in March, every thing around is &s;o bleak, and the com|munication between one neighbour and another &s;o often impeded by bad roads or bad weather, that a comfortable, agreeable &s;ociety, in which (after all our various ways of pur&s;uing plea&s;ure), it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed our fir&s;t enjoyment con&s;i&s;ts, is le&s;s practicable in the country than in town; be&s;ides mo&s;t people are of that opinion, and the country of cour&s;e mu&s;t have been quite de&s;erted when you arrived in it.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="272">Yes, an&s;wered I; but when I retired to Hubert Hill I was &s;o &s;ingularly &s;itua|ted as to carry along with me the only friends to whom, at lea&s;t in this part of the world, I can lay claim, and they were &s;uch as mu&s;t have enlivened and en|deared the mo&s;t di&s;mal and uncomforta|ble &s;pot.</P>
<P>After &s;uch a declaration, I mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to enquire of whom this enviable party con&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>You &s;afely may, &s;aid I, &s;ince my bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter con&s;tituted the whole.</P>
<P>And is your heart, Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e friends, amia|ble and de&s;erving as they are, that no place is left in it for the numbers who mu&s;t have mourned your ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>When I left London, &s;aid I with a &s;udden warmth, which the recollection of our forlorn &s;ituation forcibly excited, it contained not one human &s;oul, who, had they been certain they &s;hould have
<PB N="270" REF="273">
beheld me no more, would have endured one moment's regret.</P>
<P>The idea was &s;o melancholy, that a tear &s;tarted into my eye, not I'm afraid un&s;een by Roat&s;ley, for he in&s;tantly re|plied&mdash;Ah! Mi&s;s Seymour, that is wholly and utterly impo&s;&s;ible. Tho&s;e who are formed by nature for charming their own &s;ex and enchanting our's, cannot fail of converting into friends and admirers all ble&s;t with the happine&s;s of their acquaint|ance.</P>
<P>This compliment, pronounced in a voice of mixed eagerne&s;e and &s;oftne&s;s, could not fail to confu&s;e me: and unable to make a proper reply, or to di&s;claim a compliment much too flattering even for acknowledgement, I could only reply with much he&s;itation&mdash;oh! Mr. Roat&s;ley, how can you po&s;&s;ibly imagine&mdash;be&s;ides you know I am quite a &s;tranger in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Loveline&s;s, continued he in the &s;ame
<PB N="271" REF="274">
&s;train, is an object too intere&s;ting to man|kind in general to prove a &s;tranger in any quarter of the globe. Where there are &s;ouls to feel its influence, it mu&s;t be felt with force and energy irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>To this an an&s;wer was &s;till more im|po&s;&s;ible and I did not attempt it. Find|ing I was &s;ilent&mdash;I have the plea&s;ure of con&s;idering my&s;elf, &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e, as your fir&s;t Engli&s;h acquaintance. Will you not then allow me the inexpre&s;&s;ible happine&s;s of a place in this envied li&s;t of your friends. Be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall yield to none in the intere&s;t. I hold in your wel|fare.</P>
<P>The warmth of his expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;till more the eagerne&s;s of his counte|nance, covered me with blu&s;hes, and I could only reply by a &s;light bow of ac|knowledgement. I took courage at length to add, that the obligations I owed him &s;ufficiently proved his claim to be con&s;idered in that light.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="275">This conver&s;ation naturally led him, with a gaiety that &s;oon bani&s;hed my con|&s;cious confu&s;ion, to mention the circum|&s;tances of our fir&s;t meeting, from which, by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, he proceeded to talk upon many intere&s;ting topicks. In the cour&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e, I was not a little &s;urprized to hear him mention Lord Belmont's name more than once with the mo&s;t uncon&s;cious ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, and found my&s;elf &s;till more bewildered when I perceived he &s;eemed even de&s;ir|ous of drawing from me every circum|&s;tance relating to my &s;ituation abroad that he could contrive, without an ap|pearance of impertinent curio&s;ity, to ob|tain.</P>
<P>Various were the particulars into which he had the addre&s;s, though with the ut|mo&s;t politene&s;s, to penetrate. I was a&s;to|ni&s;hed and confounded by his behaviour, yet I &s;till remained convinced that his ig|norance was feigned: and while I an|&s;wered

&s;imply and naturally to all his en|quiries, pride made me di&s;dain to force him to an explanation, which mu&s;t de|tect his duplicity, and cover him with confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>At length&mdash;your accent is &s;o little defective Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;aid he, that it is difficult for me to believe you never were in England till now.</P>
<P>I left it when &s;o very young, replied I, that I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant re|collection of ever having been in it.</P>
<P>Having quitted it &s;o very early, is equivalent to your never having been in it. But I always under&s;tood, Mi&s;s Sey|mour, that France had had the honour of your birth.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed, and entirely off my guard at this &s;peech, I involuntarily exclaimed &mdash;good heavens! Mr. Roat&s;ley, how can you &s;ay &s;o? Is it po&s;&s;ible you can affect this ignorance.</P>
<P>Ignorance! repeated he. Little as I
<PB N="274" REF="277">
have had the happine&s;s of enjoying your company, and &s;hort as has been the pe|riod of our acquaintance, it is not &s;ur|prizing that I &s;hould be ignorant of this as well as of a thou&s;and other circum|&s;tances into which I have never had the pre&s;umption to enquire, however anxious my de&s;ire of information has been.</P>
<P>Are you indeed &s;erious, cried I; for inexplicable as it appeared, I now per|ceived that all was as yet a &s;ecret to him.</P>
<P>Never more &s;o than at this moment. But why &s;hould it a&s;toni&s;h you &s;o much? is it not the natural con&s;equence of&mdash;</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, cried I, interrupting him, I have believed till this in&s;tant that you were as perfectly well informed of every circum&s;tance of my birth and education as the mo&s;t intimate of my friends can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or as I my&s;elf am.</P>
<P>My ignorance, be a&s;&s;ured, an&s;wered he, has re&s;ulted neither from want of anxiety nor want of exertion to obtain

information; but &s;imply that from your recent arrival in this country your circle of acquaintance was not exten&s;ive, and none &s;eemed more in the &s;ecret than my&s;elf. Mi&s;s Seymour cannot &s;uppo&s;e that where &s;he appeared &s;he could re|main di&s;regarded and unnoticed. Vari|ous were the accounts relating to her that reached my ears; but they were uniformly vague and un&s;atisfactory, and I am convinced void of foundation. Since however the fate of my enquiries ap|pears to you &s;o extraordinary, I hope you will not think my earne&s;t reque&s;t of an explanation too pre&s;uming. Under the happy title ju&s;t now granted me may I dare to venture on &s;uch a demand?</P>
<P>Amazement, &s;atisfaction, and a variety of other emotions, at once &s;o powerfully a&s;&s;ailed me, that for a few moments I could not articulate; and grew &s;o &s;ud|denly pale, that Roat&s;ley ha&s;tily applied to Mi&s;s Patty for her &s;melling bottle;

who, extremely frightened, was about to have alarmed my &s;i&s;ter, and the re&s;t of the party, had I not recollected my&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ured her my indi&s;po&s;ition was &s;light and already gone off. To any other per&s;on my countenance might have di&s;covered that my &s;pirits were more af|fected than my health; but engro&s;&s;ed with the novelty of the performance, which had now advanced to the begin|ning of the &s;econd act, my young com|panion had not given the &s;lighte&s;t atten|tion to our conver&s;ation, and having been often told I &s;uppo&s;e that fine ladies were vapouri&s;h and hy&s;terical, did not &s;eem either &s;u&s;picious or &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>Far otherwi&s;e were the conclu&s;ions of Mr. Roat&s;ley. Shocked and confounded, he began to apprehend a my&s;tery, to un|ravel which he had not received the &s;lighte&s;t hint or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I am in the agonies of the mo&s;t painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;aid he after a pau&s;e: but &s;ince the &s;ubject is
<PB N="277" REF="280">
&s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, I am contented nay even eager to remain in ignorance.</P>
<P>You &s;hall be informed of every thing you may de&s;ire to know, &s;aid I, when I found my&s;elf a little recovered; but at pre&s;ent all explanation is impo&s;&s;ible. A few words will not &s;uffice; and even if they &s;hould, I am incapable my&s;elf of entering on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>From whom then, will you allow me to expect it?</P>
<P>From my brother, Mr. Howard. He will tell you all.</P>
<P><HI>All!</HI> repeated he, &s;till more con|founded. The &s;olemnity of the phra&s;e almo&s;t alarms me.</P>
<P>The entrance of a large party of gen|tlemen and ladies ju&s;t at this in&s;tant cre|ated a noi&s;e and bu&s;tle which carried our eyes to the door. Good God! ex|claimed Roat&s;ley in a tone of vexa|tion; and I in&s;tantly di&s;covered Lady Marry Lawrance, her niece Lady Eliza|beth,
<PB N="278" REF="281">
Mi&s;s Dudley, and in &s;hort the whole party at Holtenham, (Lady Lin|ro&s;e and Mi&s;s Lucy Dudley excepted) e&s;corted by Sir Edward Sudbury and &s;e|veral other young men.</P>
<P>As we had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the front bench, &s;eats for &s;o many people occa|&s;ioned &s;ome confu&s;ion. That on which we were placed could not contain above one half of the ladies, it being already more than half filled; and though the one behind was almo&s;t empty, having been purpo&s;ely kept for the more fa&s;hion|able part of the audience, they &s;eemed to di&s;dain occupying it, and &s;tood &s;ome time very civilly expre&s;&s;ing their di&s;ap|pointment aloud with the expectation that our party would ri&s;e and give them place.</P>
<P>This act of politene&s;s, however, we had no &s;ort of intention of performing. Indeed, for my&s;elf, the haughty pre|&s;umption of their behaviour would have
<PB N="279" REF="282">
deterred me from taking any &s;teps to|wards their accommodation; but at pre|&s;ent the unexpected appearance of Lady Elizabeth, who for an hour before had not once obtruded on my mind, now wholly bani&s;hed that plea&s;ing &s;atisfac|faction and inward complacency which the knowledge that Roat&s;ley had not yet de&s;erted us diffu&s;ed over my feelings. I was &s;unk and di&s;pirited, and not in the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to be civil and attentive to any of this fa&s;hionable &s;et, Lady Mary excepted, who came up to my &s;i&s;ter, and addre&s;&s;ed us with her u&s;ual good breeding and affability.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dudley, a few minutes after &s;he entered, perceiving her brother, who had ri&s;en to pay his re&s;pects to the ladies, immediately called out&mdash;Lord brother, when did you arrive in this part of the world?</P>
<P>Only la&s;t night, returned he. I came to &s;pend a few days with Brad&s;haw at his
<PB N="280" REF="283">
quarters, and he brought me hither for the purpo&s;e of encouraging the&s;e poor people. I did not expect to find &s;o much good company, nor to meet with &s;o many of my friends.</P>
<P>Nay, an&s;wered &s;he, we never &s;hould have thought of coming to this poor lit|tle place, which mu&s;t be a &s;ad, &s;tupid affair, but it &s;eems the man who dig|nifies him&s;elf with the title of manager prayed Lady Mary &s;o hard to patronize them, that out of mere compa&s;&s;ion &s;he be&s;poke the play, and in&s;i&s;ted we &s;hould all attend her.</P>
<P>Lady Elizabeth ju&s;t then advancing, exclaimed in a tone of impatience loud enough to be heard all over the hou&s;e&mdash; Lard, only think of the&s;e people having taken our places; and pre&s;ently per|ceiving me&mdash;how do you do, Mi&s;s Sey|mour? cried &s;he with a carele&s;s air; and without waiting a reply, continued in my
<PB N="281" REF="284">
hearing to expre&s;s her wonder, <HI>what the people could mean.</HI></P>
<P>Her harangue was all at once inter|rupted by the unexpected &s;ight of Mr. Roat&s;ley, who came forward to pay her his compliments. I watched what ef|fect this &s;udden meeting might produce in the countenances of both, and re|marked that they mutually reddened ex|tremely at the rencontre; but while Roat&s;ley addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her with a re&s;pectful but di&s;tant air, her manner to him appeared to betray an over acted di&s;play of dignity and re&s;erve. She re|covered her little embarra&s;&s;ment very &s;peedily however; for &s;he immediately recurred to her &s;cornful expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urpri&s;e, and repeated her complaints to him, who politely offered her the place he had ju&s;t quitted by me.</P>
<P>No, cried &s;he carele&s;sly, I can't be di|vided from my party.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="285">Had your Lady&s;hip engaged places? &s;aid he.</P>
<P>O Lord, no. How &s;hould one think of &s;uch a thing in &s;uch a place as this. But when the people came to &s;olicit us to go, they told us the fir&s;t bench &s;hould be re&s;erved for any people of fa&s;hion who might take it into their heads to come, and behold all the par&s;ons wives and daughters I believe in the county have a&s;&s;embled to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the only tolerable places in the barn.</P>
<P>Roat&s;ley looked by no means plea&s;ed at this rude &s;peech, which he knew I could not but overhear, and replied with quickne&s;s&mdash;But as your Lady&s;hip can't &s;uppo&s;e any of the ladies will give up their &s;eats, I would advi&s;e you to accept of mine.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard and the good Doctor having by this time ri&s;en to accommo|date the company, and placed &s;ome of the children behind, room was at length
<PB N="283" REF="286">
made for them; and by this arrange|ment Roat&s;ley was once more placed next me with Lady Elizabeth on his other hand.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip cho&s;e not to favour me with any further notice during the re|mainder of the evening; and Mi&s;s Dud|ley, who did not even afford me the ci|vility of a di&s;tant bow, &s;at with her eyes fixed on the &s;pot where her brother was placed, whom &s;he examined with an a&s;|pect of &s;uch ill humour and di&s;plea&s;ure, every time he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, that I felt beyond mea&s;ure unea&s;y.</P>
<P>She had not the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on, how|ever, to dread or even to &s;u&s;pect any a&s;&s;i|duity on his part towards me; for his behaviour was now totally changed. He looked grave, thoughtful, and ab&s;orbed. The little he &s;aid was forced and con|&s;trained&punc; and his attentions were divided with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s equally between Lady Elizabeth and my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="287">Her admirer, or rather her attendant, Sir Edward, under pretence of avoiding to crowd her, in&s;i&s;ted on relinqui&s;hing a place her Lady&s;hip had procured him immediately behind her, and teized me not a little, (for it mu&s;t be owned I was not in the be&s;t humour) by &s;tanding at my &s;ide with his u&s;ual &s;olicitude, and en|tering into conver&s;ation with me. I was le&s;s than ever in a mood for li&s;tening to him, particularly as I ob&s;erved that Roat&s;ley lent an attentive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar to all that pa&s;&s;ed between us; the purport of which con&s;i&s;ted in much anxiety in regard to my accident, and at length in an explicit but diffident reque&s;t that I would allow him the honour of vi&s;iting me at Hubert Hill, and would favour him with an in|troduction to Mr. Howard, whom he &s;aid he had never been &s;o fortunate as to meet at Mrs. Hindon's.</P>
<P>The recollection of his behaviour on a certain occa&s;ion, rendered a refu&s;al, or
<PB N="285" REF="288">
even an eva&s;ion of this demand, impo&s;&s;i|ble, though the unbounded &s;atisfaction he te&s;tified on my compliance, made me &s;peedily apprehend that I ought not to have con&s;ented, and induced me to fear I had granted more than I de&s;igned by the introduction.</P>
<P>He and Mr. Roat&s;ley &s;eemed inti|mately acquainted. Between the acts they joined each other, and continued in earne&s;t conver&s;ation; and from the gra|vity of the one countenance and the too apparent exultation of the other, I could not avoid &s;u&s;pecting that Sir Edward was confe&s;&s;ing his &s;anguine expectations to his friend. You &s;mile at my vanity, Sophia; but the attentions of this young man are &s;o pointed and undi&s;gui&s;ed, that they attract univer&s;al ob&s;ervation where|ever I meet him; though my manner (uniformly as re&s;erved as good breeding will allow it to be) te&s;tifies as plainly as
<PB N="286" REF="289">
words almo&s;t could do, how little I am gratified by his notice.</P>
<P>Lady Elizabeth, deprived of the de|voirs of one admirer, and not much &s;oothed by the cold politene&s;s of another, lavi&s;hed all her &s;miles, good humour, and conde&s;cen&s;ion, upon a young man of a very &s;ingular appearance, who &s;at on her left hand, and who &s;eemed &s;o entirely to atone for the neglect of the others, that I perceived her &s;uppo&s;ed partiality to Sir Edward was merely the indi&s;criminate love of flattery and admi|ration. Her pre&s;ent lover (for &s;uch his a&s;&s;iduities evidently confe&s;&s;ed him to be) I was informed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;plendid for|tune, and was of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, but his name I have forgot. He was dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tile of a common groom or hor&s;e jockey, and his hair, cut &s;hort behind, hung about his ears with a negligence which betrayed not only di&s;re&s;pect for the company, but a total di&s;regard both
<PB N="287" REF="290">
of cleanline&s;s and propriety; yet an air of con&s;cious con&s;equence, and a very hand&s;ome figure, which he tried in vain to di&s;gui&s;e, betrayed his latent impor|tance. He &s;eemed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exuber|ant &s;pirits; for his Lord&s;hip and Lady Elizabeth, by their talking and laughing, gave great offence and occa&s;ioned much di&s;turbance to the ru&s;tic part of the au|dience, who were not &s;o refined as to de&s;pi&s;e the performance, but on the con|trary enjoyed it with all the reli&s;h of no+velty.</P>
<P>The actors indeed were &s;o mi&s;erably bad, that the whole exhibition had infi|nitely more the appearance of the comic than of the Tragic Mu&s;e; and attending to it was &s;o little intere&s;ting, and in my &s;ituation of mind &s;o impo&s;&s;ible, that I ought not to blame her Lady&s;hip for en|deavouring to draw amu&s;ement from another channel, e&s;pecially as I my&s;elf followed her example mo&s;t part of the
<PB N="288" REF="291">
evening: but there was an unfeeling and unpardonable indelicacy in te&s;tifying with &s;o little di&s;gui&s;e the ridicule which the poor people who were labouring for our amu&s;ement excited, and the bur&s;ts of ungoverned laughter, and &s;evere raillery, that reached their ears from this polite party, was a mortification in which I would not for worlds have joined. I had the &s;atisfaction of perceiving that Roat&s;|ley was equally &s;hocked at their beha|viour: and not only applauded wherever any particular expectation of approbation was betrayed, but engaged all the gen|tlemen round him to drown, by every te&s;|timony of &s;atisfaction, the hi&s;&s;ing with which Lady Elizabeth's gay admirer frequently a&s;&s;ailed the performers.</P>
<P>All particular conver&s;ation was at an end between Roat&s;ley and me from the moment of Lady Elizabeth's appearance; and that which had preceded her en|trance, by perplexing andengro&s;&s;ing us,
<PB N="289" REF="292">
had mutually unfitted us for di&s;cour&s;ing on tho&s;e little trifles that u&s;ually pre&s;ent them&s;elves as topics of general di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. He &s;eemed &s;o evidently oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;omething that lay unea&s;ily on his mind, that I could not po&s;&s;ibly conclude mere curio&s;ity to have excited an impre&s;&s;ion &s;o apparently un&s;urmountable; and &s;oothed and gratified as I had been in the beginning of the evening, I &s;oon be|gan to &s;u&s;pect that he regarded with pain and di&s;plea&s;ure the coquetry of Lady Elizabeth's behaviour. He often fixed his eyes upon her for &s;ome mo|ments together with a look of &s;crutiny and inve&s;tigation, &s;eemed to watch every word and movement that e&s;caped her, and though he &s;eldom addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her, to <HI>me</HI> he attended &s;till le&s;s. He appeared indeed wholly ab&s;orbed by his own reflections; and &s;carce could I trace the &s;ame in&s;inuating manner, which but
<PB N="290" REF="293">
one half hour before had delighted me &s;o much.</P>
<P>The pain of this ob&s;ervation, which &s;trehgthened every moment, convinced me I had been uncon&s;ciou&s;ly deluding my&s;elf with fal&s;e and chimerical hopes. If Lady Elizabeth was indifferent to him, why did her conduct &s;o evidently affect and di&s;plea&s;e him; if his chains were heavy and his heart unconcerned, her pre|&s;ent conduct was preci&s;ely what he ought to have de&s;ired and enjoyed; and if his eager profe&s;&s;ions of regard and friend&s;hip for me were as warm and potent as I wi&s;hed them, whence came this &s;udden languor and re&s;erve, when by an act of confidence I was about to give him a proof of my e&s;teem.</P>
<P>There was but one way of &s;olving the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies, and it was blind|ne&s;s not to perceive it: involved in an engagement, with the &s;plendid advan|tages of which probably he was him&s;elf
<PB N="291" REF="294">
dazzled, he had re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the path &s;o anxiou&s;ly pointed out to him by his family, while the folly and in&s;ipidity of the object of his vows, without ope|rating &s;o violently as to deter him from his purpo&s;e, &s;hocked his feelings and opened his eyes to the dangers of fulfilling it.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections only &s;erved to &s;hew me that redoubled exertions were re|quired to fortify my mind again&s;t the weakne&s;s of my heart; and I began to form a &s;ecret plan of mental rigour which I flattered my&s;elf mu&s;t in time re|&s;tore the tranquillity I had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Sufficient time was given me for the&s;e good re&s;olutions; for Sir Edward on the one hand had been called away by Mr. Brad&s;haw, and Roat&s;ley on the other pre&s;erved his determined &s;ilence &s;o re&s;o|lutely, that I had no apprehen&s;ion of any interruption. The return of the former, however, at length forced me to
<PB N="292" REF="295">
give a con&s;trained attention to his con|ver&s;ation; but finding that to affect a gaiety foreign to my feelings was beyond mea&s;ure irk&s;ome and in&s;upportable in my pre&s;ent frame of mind, yet con&s;cious I could not too &s;oon drive from my thoughts a crowd of flattering retro&s;pec|tions, which &s;ometimes for an in&s;tant bani&s;hed my de&s;pondency and occa&s;ioned a new conflict, I endeavoured, as an e&s;cape both from Sir Edward and my|&s;elf, to lend an ear to the play, the pa|thetic beauties of which not even the mi&s;erable deficiencies of the performers could wholly ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>The player who appeared in the cha|racter of Glo&s;ter, happened to be in fact blind; a circum&s;tance which, as his voice was good and his action much &s;u|perior to that of his companions, ren|dered him an intere&s;ting and mo&s;t me|lancholy object. In the fourth act, when the unexpected meeting between Glo&s;ter
<PB N="293" REF="296">
and his &s;on takes place, the pathos and feeling with which the unhappy father exclaimed&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;Oh dear &s;on Edgar!</L>
<L>The food of thy abu&s;ed father's wrath!</L>
<L>Might I but live to <HI>&s;ee</HI> thee in my <HI>touch</HI></L>
<L>I'd &s;ay I had eyes again&mdash;</L></Q>
affected me &s;o poignantly, that I could not command my tears. In this how|ever I was not &s;ingular; for I perceived Roat&s;ley equally &s;oftened: nothing in|deed could be more mournful than the &s;cene before us, nor could any &s;ound have appeared more inhuman than a loud and childi&s;h fit of laughter, which ju&s;t at that in&s;tant bur&s;t from Lady Elizabeth. Good heavens! cried &s;he to her admirer, if the people a'nt cry|ing. Nay that is too ridiculous indeed. Pray do look, Mr. Roat&s;ley, turning to him&mdash;pray for God's &s;ake ob&s;erve the tears; how &s;oft and pretty all this is.</P>
<P>He gave her no reply; but regarding
<PB N="294" REF="297">
me for a moment, who on this occa&s;ion was the particular object of her ob&s;erva|tion and ridicule, a &s;igh e&s;caped him that &s;eemed to be vented from the heart, and he again &s;et him&s;elf to li&s;ten to the play with the anxiety of a per&s;on who wi&s;hed to avoid all interruption.</P>
<P>When all was concluded, Mr. Brad|&s;haw came up and enquired how I had been entertained. The performance on the whole, &s;aid he, was &s;uch as might have been expected, but that little &s;troke of Glo&s;ter's was truly pathetic.</P>
<P>Lady Elizabeth, who did not di&s;tinctly hear what he &s;aid, cho&s;e to join in the conver&s;ation though &s;he continued to pre&s;erve towards me the &s;ame contemp|tuous di&s;regard, and demanded of what he was talking?</P>
<P>I was mentioning to Mi&s;s Seymour, cried he, the circum&s;tance, of the poor fellow who played Glo&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="298">Oh yes! cried &s;he, incon&s;iderately, I never laughed &s;o much in my life.</P>
<P>It is an excellent je&s;t to the poor blind devil, returned he &s;arca&s;tically, to be deprived of &s;ight; and being con&s;trained in that di&s;mal &s;tate to make &s;uch ex|ertions for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is a &s;till better one.</P>
<P>Lord I don't mean &s;o, for that cer|tainly mu&s;t be quite dreadful to be &s;ure; only I was va&s;tly amu&s;ed &s;eeing the peo|ple pretend to cry, when undoubtedly the whole affair was more like a farce than any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>There is Roat&s;ley, returned Mr. Brad|&s;haw, who appears as much dejected as if he had been weeping the tender woes of Belvidera when performed by the ini|mitable Mrs. Siddons, and Mi&s;s Sey|mour too looks not only as if &s;he had been crying, but as if &s;he could cry for an hour to come.</P>
<P>I merely look as if I was fatigued and half a&s;leep, cried I.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="299">How unfortunate mu&s;t I be in my choice of topics, an&s;wered he with a &s;mile; for twice have I endured the mor|tification of learning from Mi&s;s Sey|mour's lips that I had &s;et her a&s;leep. Pray are <HI>you</HI> half a&s;leep too, cried he, turning to Roat&s;ley, are <HI>you</HI> infected with Mi&s;s Seymour's lethargic di&s;order. In|deed if I may be allowed (lowering his voice) to judge from appearances, I &s;hould pronounce you affected with &s;imi|lar &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>This &s;peech, pronounced with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t cruel archne&s;s, and of which I did not lo&s;e a &s;yllable, hurt me &s;everely. The mo&s;t painful confu|&s;ion dyed my cheeks, and I had not cou|rage for &s;ome moments to look up, le&s;t I &s;hould encounter the eyes of Roat&s;ley; but I believe he was equally confounded and embarra&s;&s;ed, for he made no an&s;wer, and a &s;hort &s;ilence &s;ucceeded, which was beyond mea&s;ure awkward and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="300">This was &s;oon interrupted by Brad|&s;haw, who appeared rather to have en|joyed than regretted the mutual confu|&s;ion he had occa&s;ioned. Mi&s;s Seymour, cried he, I was extremely &s;orry I was obliged to leave Holtenham without having the happine&s;s of again &s;eeing you. I wi&s;hed much to enquire how you had re&s;ted, and longed particularly to know of you if you had di&s;covered the &s;olution of the enigma I gave you to unriddle.</P>
<P>I have even forgot that you gave me any enigma to &s;olve, &s;aid I; and as I rai&s;ed my eyes to an&s;wer him with as much indifference as I could a&s;&s;ume, I perceived Roat&s;ley's eyes were fixed on my face with an expre&s;&s;ion of earne&s;t penetration that wholly di&s;concerted me; happily, however, my &s;i&s;ter, from whom by the accidental change of places I had been &s;eparated ju&s;t then joined us; and &s;ome previous con&s;ultation in regard
<PB N="298" REF="301">
to our mode of departure relieved me from further per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The evening, though a little cool, was plea&s;ant, and walking, had I been able for it, was the method of travelling I &s;hould have preferred; but my &s;i&s;ter, who in her rural &s;ituation retains the embers of latent vanity, was much pro|voked by the contempt and haughty in|&s;olence with which our humble party had been treated by the proud train from Holtenham, and was not a little morti|fied at the idea of being obliged to find her way through a crowd of powdered footmen and magnificent equipages to go home on foot with the par&s;on and his wife; while this fa&s;hionable company were leaving the ru&s;tic theatre with as much eclat and parade as had attended their entrance, followed by all the gay male part of the audience. She there|fore determined to remain till the la&s;t, and whi&s;peringly informed me of the
<PB N="299" REF="302">
rea&s;on; though Mr. Howard and the good Doctor, who were far from &s;u&s;|pecting this plan, urged her to be gone, as it began to grow late and there was no apparent rea&s;on for delay.</P>
<P>Poor Fanny, a&s;hamed to confe&s;s this &s;park of &s;ecret pride, which would have appeared wholly incomprehen&s;ible to the one and perhaps rather ab&s;urd to the other, was put to great difficulties in order to compleat her project; but &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;ave her&s;elf this little humiliation if po&s;&s;ible. Mrs. Heath|cote's care for her&s;elf and children, gave her likewi&s;e much pain. The good wo|man wrapt them all carefully up in large thick cloaks and handkerchiefs brought for the purpo&s;e, till they exactly re&s;em|bled Ru&s;&s;ian boors in the prints of tra|vellers; and be&s;ought Fanny in a voice loud enough to be heard all over the hou&s;e, to make her&s;elf warm, for <HI>walk|ing home</HI> in the <HI>night air</HI> was extremely
<PB N="300" REF="303">
apt to give people colds; and indeed Mrs. Howard, though this cloak is old and a little worn out, it is thick and comfortable, and I wi&s;h you would allow me to wrap it round you.</P>
<P>All this was the more &s;evere on poor Fanny's irritable feelings, as Lady Mary's carriage, which had occa&s;ioned her &s;ome little delay, ju&s;t then being announced, her Lady&s;hip in pa&s;&s;ing &s;topped to bid her good night; and Lady Elizabeth following, e&s;corted by her gay admirer, looked with a &s;mile of ridicule but half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, at the appearance of our companions.</P>
<P>Roat&s;ley, who had been called away by his &s;i&s;ter, had returned but a moment before; but perceiving Lady Mary un|attended, again left me to conduct her to her carriage, having fir&s;t be&s;ought the honour of &s;eeing me to mine, and reque&s;ted that I would not depart till his return. This circum&s;tance rendered me
<PB N="301" REF="304">
fully as anxious as my &s;i&s;ter to delay our going, while I was no le&s;s a&s;hamed to acknowledge the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>My dear, cried Mr. Howard to Fanny on coming up to us, for heavens &s;ake let us be gone. We &s;hall lo&s;e the advantage of the moon if we are not directly on foot. It is already on its decline.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent; and &s;he only replied by &s;aying we &s;hould go pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Uncon&s;cious of our &s;ecret views, he could only attribute to a childi&s;h de&s;ire of out&s;taying the company, our unwil|lingne&s;s to depart, and in&s;i&s;ted on &s;etting off immediately with me, leaving his wife under the care of the good par&s;on, with who&s;e family &s;he was to walk home.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, much plea&s;ed with this plan, which left her motions in her own power, urged me to go; and &s;evere as it was to leave the hou&s;e before Roat&s;ley's return, before we had finally adju&s;ted at what time and in what place he was to
<PB N="302" REF="305">
receive the communication &s;o much de|&s;ired, I was ab&s;olutely con&s;trained to al|low Sir Edward to lead me to the little carriage. Had I been perfectly uncon|&s;cious of any &s;ecret intere&s;t beyond that anxiety which I felt in common with my &s;i&s;ter to be on terms of intimacy with a relation &s;o amiable, I &s;hould undoubt|edly have acquainted Mr. Howard with my wi&s;h to remain, and acknowledged the cau&s;e; but the particulars were too long for immediate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion at that mo|ment, and on that &s;pot, where Sir Ed|ward never for an in&s;tant left my &s;ide: afraid therefore to di&s;cover an eagerne&s;s too keen, e&s;pecially before Mr. Brad|&s;haw, of who&s;e animadver&s;ions I was extremely apprehen&s;ive, I permitted Mr. Howard in &s;ilence to place him&s;elf by me and we drove off.</P>
<P>On &s;tepping in, I perceived by the glare of the flambeaux Roat&s;ley in earne&s;t conver&s;ation with Lady Elizabeth at the
<PB N="303" REF="306">
window of Lady Mary's carriage, and he &s;till &s;tood in the &s;ame place when I lo&s;t &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>When we got home, Fanny being longer in making her appearance than we expected, Mr. Howard grew at length unea&s;y, and went him&s;elf to &s;ee after the walking party. Finding my&s;elf alone, I threw my&s;elf on a chair, and giving way to a train of reflexions which alternately &s;oothed and tormented me, I indulged uncon&s;ciou&s;ly in a fit of mu&s;ing which &s;oftened rather than relieved me.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;tily conclude this letter, hav|ing an immediate opportunity of &s;ending it to my Sophia.</P>
