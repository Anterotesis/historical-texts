<P>THE author of the following plain Di&s;|cour&s;es hopes they will be u&s;eful. Plain di&s;cour&s;es, in his opinion, are be&s;t calcu|lated for general benefit. He mu&s;t remark, al&s;o, that mo&s;t clergymen &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e their audiences wi&s;er than they really are, and that, on this ground, they frequently addre&s;s to them &s;uch profound di&s;qui&s;itions, as can be of no u&s;e becau&s;e above their comprehen&s;ion. It will be allowed, that the be&s;t mode of diffu&s;ing a knowledge of the &s;criptures, and of practically enforc|ing all its doctrines, is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of preaching. He does not, therefore, give into the fa&s;hion of amu&s;ing the reader, or the hearer, with a &s;entimental <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> or with a trim philo&s;ophic e&s;&s;ay, which &s;eems to have almo&s;t any other object more in view than chri&s;tian edification. Others will continue to think differently from him. Let every one be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE I. OUR OBLIGATIONS TO ENQUIRE INTO OUR DUTY, OR TO APPLY OURSELVES TO THE DISCOVERY OF OUR TRUE WAY TO HAPPINESS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The fir&s;t part on this text.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JEREMIAH vi. 16.</BIBL>
<Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord, &s;tand ye in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t for your &s;ouls.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AN indolent habit, and a precipitate conduct, are equally prejudicial to our be&s;t intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The mind, as well as the body, was, it is obvious, originally intended for labour.</P>
<P>But, that we might not labour in vain, it has plea&s;ed God, in his goodne&s;s, to
<PB N="2" REF="11">
give us rea&s;on to <HI>examine,</HI> and an under|&s;tanding to <HI>know, the things that are true.</HI></P>
<P>And, as he is the ab&s;olutely perfect being, who does nothing in vain, it mu&s;t, therefore, be his &s;overeign will, that we exert, and improve tho&s;e great talents which he has committed to our tru&s;t. Certainly, there|fore, it mu&s;t be our highe&s;t honour and happine&s;s to comply with the divine ap|pointment.</P>
<P>We accordingly find, that mi&s;ery is the inevitable con&s;equence of vice, and that vice always &s;helters it&s;elf, under an incon|&s;iderate and thoughtle&s;s habit, or under a blind and &s;tubborn attachment to &s;y&s;tems of opinions, which were either framed by our&s;elves at random, or handed down to us by others, without any enquiry.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, as activity is the health and &s;trength of the body, and the &s;ource of its greate&s;t perfection, enquiry, in like manner, is the enlightener, the improver, and the bracer of the mind. Without enquiry, the mind mu&s;t always continue in a weak and languid &s;tate, whatever ac|cidental
<PB N="3" REF="12">
advantages it may now and then have had to relieve it; whereas, a &s;erious and impartial enquiry, through whatever perplexing mazes it may lead us, will at la&s;t terminate in precious truth.</P>
<P>True religion, therefore, the religion of rea&s;on, and the religion which has God for its author, calls us to the <HI>light,</HI> that our deeds may be made manife&s;t what they are, and that, from repeated circum&s;pec|tion and information, we may daily more and more grow up into the divine likene&s;s.</P>
<P>On the contrary, every fal&s;e religion is <HI>afraid of the light,</HI> demands our pa&s;&s;ive acquie&s;cence in all its contradictory doc|trines, wrappeth it&s;elf up in impenetrable clouds of my&s;tery, <HI>neither cometh to the light,</HI> le&s;t its &s;andy foundation &s;hould be detected, and expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Every &s;inner, in like manner, lurketh about in &s;ecret places, and <HI>loveth darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e his deeds are evil.</HI> He &s;hunneth reflection, becau&s;e his con|&s;cience will not bear the in&s;pection of &s;uch a judge; and, as he &s;inketh in igno|rance,
<PB N="4" REF="13">
he proportionably &s;inketh into the dregs of iniquity.</P>
<P>Hence all the wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery of the Jewi&s;h nation, as we may learn from all their prophets, and their whole hi&s;tory from beginning to end. <HI>My peo|ple will not con&s;ider.</HI> Thus &s;aid the Lord, in his repeated admonitions to that aban|doned race. They hated in&s;truction, and ca&s;t reproof behind them. They &s;aid, <HI>peace, peace,</HI> when there was <HI>no</HI> peace; and they committed abomination without &s;hame. From the lea&s;t of them even to the greate&s;t, &s;ome few characters always excepted, every one was given to cove|tou&s;ne&s;s; from the prophet even to the prie&s;t every one dealt fal&s;ely.</P>
<P>Therefore, the judgments of God, which were long retarded, through his forbearance and long &s;uffering, &s;tood in array again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Yet, the adorably benignant &s;overeign, was not willing that they &s;hould peri&s;h, but that they &s;hould turn to him, and be &s;aved. To this purpo&s;e, then, as an
<PB N="5" REF="14">
effectual remedy again&s;t all the evils that threatened them, he graciou&s;ly directed them in the words of the text, to exert tho&s;e faculties which he had given them for attaining true happine&s;s, and not, to their own &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face, de&s;pi&s;e the riches of his goodne&s;s, which would lead them to repentance. <HI>Thus,</HI> &s;aid <HI>the Lord, &s;tand ye in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t for your &s;ouls.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Be ye not unwi&s;e, but under&s;tanding what the will of the Lord is;</HI> for I have given you a lamp to your feet, which ye need only to ob&s;erve, and follow, and all will be well."</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing, which I &s;hall con&s;ider, in the words of the text, is the infinite compa&s;&s;ion and loving kindne&s;s of God, even to &s;inners, to notorious and abandoned &s;inners. Hence, we may, &s;econdly, be gratefully di&s;po&s;ed to give the greate&s;t at|tention to tho&s;e means of &s;alvation which
<PB N="6" REF="15">
he has graciou&s;ly propo&s;ed, to rein&s;tate us in his favour.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in the words of the text is the infinite compa&s;&s;ion and loving kindne&s;s of God, even to &s;inners, to notorious, and abandoned &s;inners.</P>
<P>Though ignorance has frequently repre|&s;ented this all glorious Being, an implaca|ble &s;evere and inexorable judge, inexorable to the lea&s;t offending &s;upplicant, rea&s;on and revelation univer&s;ally declare, that he is not the enemy of any creature he has made, but <HI>rich in mercy unto all.</HI></P>
<P>The Jews, are a mo&s;t illu&s;trious mani|fe&s;tation of this truth, who, from their fir&s;t origin, were a &s;tubborn, and gain&s;aying people.</P>
<P>Immediately after their redemption from Egyptian bondage, they murmured again&s;t that good providence, which wrought out their &s;alvation for them, and turned a&s;ide from the commandments of their God.</P>
<P>Again, &s;oon after they were &s;ettled in the promi&s;ed land, they &s;tupidly, and un|gratefully, &s;uffered them&s;elves to be drawn
<PB N="7" REF="16">
into all the vices of the neighbouring na|tions, into tho&s;e very vices for which the Canaanites were driven out before them.</P>
<P>In &s;ucceeding ages, in return for re|peated mercies, they too generally became the more unthankful and unholy. And, at la&s;t, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the whole head was &s;ick, the whole heart was faint; from the &s;ole of the foot even to the head, there was no &s;oundne&s;s in them, but wounds and brui&s;es, and putrifying &s;ores."</Q></P>
<P>Yet, in the&s;e mo&s;t deplorable circum|&s;tances, God was not willing that they &s;hould peri&s;h, but that they &s;hould turn unto him, and <HI>find re&s;t for their &s;ouls. Thou,</HI> &s;aid this gracious Being to that people, <HI>ha&s;t played the harlot with many lovers; thou ha&s;t for&s;aken me, and ha&s;t burnt incen&s;e unto other Gods, and wor&s;hipped the works of thy own hands;</HI>&mdash;but, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e things, <HI>return again unto me &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>A&s;&s;uredly, then, this is not the lan|guage of an inexorable &s;overeign, or of a reprobating God. This is plainly the lan|guage
<PB N="8" REF="17">
of THE FATHER OF ALL MERCIES. If we <HI>&s;tand in the ways and &s;ee,</HI> there is not any God like unto our God, as he clear|ly, and conde&s;cendingly repre&s;ents him&s;elf. As great as his power is, &s;o great is his love. All his works proclaim him God our Sa|viour. And, he calleth us, by all his di&s;|pen&s;ations, by all his prophets, and by his own &s;on; to flee from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not, therefore, indeed we cannot, without giving our&s;elves up to be led blindfold and &s;tifling the natural re|flections of our own minds, <HI>for&s;ake him the fountain of living waters, and hew us out ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water.</HI> We &s;hould, and we will, if we &s;ufficiently rou&s;e up our intellectual facul|ties, <HI>wa&s;h, and be clean, &s;eek the Lord whil&s;t he may be found,</HI> and in&s;tantly re&s;olve to lay hold upon the crown of eternal life.</P>
<P>But, what we &s;hould do, what it mu&s;t be at all times of infinite importance to us to do, that it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t &s;tupendous folly and madne&s;s in us ever to neglect doing.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18">
Every impenitent &s;inner ought to be &s;truck with horror at his own deformity, and be a&s;hamed to &s;hew his head. He is a mon&s;ter in the creation. He is a traitor to his be&s;t friend. He rebels again&s;t the Lord of Heaven and Earth. He de|faceth the image of God within him. All his ways are darkne&s;s; and his &s;teps take hold on hell. What an odious and de&s;picable character does he, therefore, exhibit to the world! How full of infamy and wretchedne&s;s is every part of this cha|racter! And, how earne&s;tly, and con&s;tantly, therefore, &s;hould we avoid it, and abhor it!</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e then, let us &s;eriou&s;ly attend, in the &s;econd place, to tho&s;e di|rections that were given to the Jews in the text, and which we may ea&s;ily apply to our own particular circum&s;tances. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus &s;aith the Lord, &s;tand ye in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk therein."</Q></P>
<P>Now, the fir&s;t information which we gain from the&s;e words, is, that God has furni&s;hed us with &s;ufficient powers to
<PB N="10" REF="19">
acquire the knowledge of our duty. Here, again, it is implied, in the &s;econd place, that this is plain and ea&s;y to us, and, in the third place, that we &s;hould exerci&s;e our|&s;elves in the di&s;covery of it. We learn, in the next place, what is the be&s;t method of acquiring the knowledge of our duty; and we are taught, in the la&s;t place, that <HI>obedi|ence</HI> as well as <HI>knowledge</HI> is expected from us.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e directions, which are given us in the text, how to e&s;cape the wrath to come, and to approve our&s;elves the objects of infinite mercy, it is in the fir&s;t place, demon&s;trably implied, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God has given us &s;ufficient powers to acquire the knowledge of our duty."</Q></P>
<P>Our lot, indeed, mu&s;t have been pe|culiarly hard, if our duty were beyond our reach, and if, notwith&s;tanding, we were liable to puni&s;hment for remaining ignorant of it. But this is evidently not the ca&s;e; becau&s;e, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, &s;tand ye in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, where is the good way.</HI> We can, therefore,
<PB N="11" REF="20">
&s;tand in the ways, and &s;ee, and, al&s;o, find out the good way, unle&s;s it be our own fault.</P>
<P>It would be infinitely deba&s;ing the character of the &s;upreme and matchle&s;s Jehovah, it would be in&s;ulting him with the mo&s;t bla&s;phemous language, to &s;up|po&s;e him capable of mocking &s;uch feeble creatures as we are; whom, if power were the only mea&s;ure of his government, he could in&s;tantly de&s;troy with the breath of his mouth. As he has commanded, there|fore, we mu&s;t have the power to obey, we mu&s;t be able to <HI>&s;eek</HI> and <HI>find</HI> him, to di&s;cover his will, and yield a &s;incere obe|dience to it.</P>
<P>But, his command is clear, and po&s;i|tive. He does not &s;ay, <HI>you can do nothing, being as de&s;titute of power as the ground you tread upon.</HI> Nor does he &s;ay, <HI>wait you the Lord's time,</HI> becau&s;e every time is the Lord's time, if we be willing to improve it. He no where teaches us to con&s;ider our&s;elves as the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments of fate, incapable of a good word, or thought, or
<PB N="12" REF="21">
action, unle&s;s we be fir&s;t irre&s;i&s;tably wrought upon by &s;ome miraculous interpo&s;ition; but, on the contrary, univer&s;ally addre&s;&s;eth us as beings, who, by the endowments of his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, can our&s;elves ex|amine, di&s;cover, and embrace the things that belong to our peace. <HI>Stand,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, and <HI>&s;ee.</HI> We, therefore, as I have already ob&s;erved, can &s;tand and &s;ee. Other|wi&s;e, indeed, we could not be accountable for any part of our conduct; nor could there be any di&s;tinction of character, between tho&s;e, who are reputed the be&s;t, and tho&s;e who are reputed the very wor&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>But, here, it is farther obvious, that as we are con&s;tituted moral and accountable creatures, it mu&s;t be of the utmo&s;t im|portance to us, to be per&s;uaded that we are &s;uch. For, we may be as well without the power of doing good, as from the notion that we have not this power, neglect the exertion of it. We &s;hould not, therefore, give way to a benumbing torpor of mind, nor be tempted to imagine, whil&s;t God has &s;poken to us, that he has &s;poken to us to
<PB N="13" REF="22">
no manner of purpo&s;e, but &s;hould humbly hearken to his voice, which is univer&s;ally confirmed by the te&s;timony of our own brea&s;ts; and whil&s;t we gratefully acknow|ledge his gifts, we &s;hould be anxious to improve them to tho&s;e benevolent purpo&s;es, for which they were be&s;towed, that, thus, we may finally <HI>have prai&s;e of him, and re|joice in our&s;elves for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>But, we may learn, in the &s;econd place, from the words of the text, that the knowledge of our duty is, in general, &s;o far from being my&s;terious, or unintelli|gible to us, that, with a little attention, it mu&s;t be univer&s;ally plain and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>We are not &s;uppo&s;ed, by the prophet, to be left in the dark, but con&s;idered in the light of travellers, who have &s;ome par|ticular, di&s;tant, habitation in view, and who, capable of a&s;certaining at what point this lieth, have only to <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> amid&s;t a variety of ways that lead to different habitations, and <HI>&s;ee</HI> which is the <HI>right</HI> way. And as tho&s;e who are travelling ea&s;tward, have only to keep the ea&s;tern point in view, and then
<PB N="14" REF="23">
to ob&s;erve amid&s;t ten thou&s;and different ways, which guides them in a right line to their wi&s;hed-for habitation, and to follow this; we, in like manner, have only to <HI>en|quire</HI> and <HI>know,</HI> to <HI>&s;eek</HI> and <HI>find,</HI> to <HI>open our eyes</HI> and <HI>&s;ee</HI> what our duty is. As Mo&s;es &s;aid to the children of I&s;rael, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This commandment, which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, nei|ther is it far off,&mdash;but the word is very nigh unto thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou maye&s;t do it."</Q> He would have expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame thing, if he had &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is &s;o far from being be|yond the reach of man, that it is all within him&s;elf, unle&s;s he be an idle, and unprofitable &s;ervant.'</Q></P>
<P>And, according to his declaration, our own experience will convince us, that we have only to commune a moment with our own hearts, upon the different pur&s;uits of men, and we &s;hall &s;oon di&s;cover which is the <HI>good</HI> way.</P>
<P>As plea&s;ure, and riches, and honours are tran&s;ient, and un&s;atisfying goods, our rea&s;on
<PB N="15" REF="24">
will, therefore, in&s;tantly teach us, that nei|ther of the&s;e can be the good way. The <HI>good way</HI> mu&s;t give us joy upon reflection; and, as we advance in it, give us &s;till nearer and more enlarged views of complete hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider, then, a little farther, we &s;hall find that the love of God and man only can admini&s;ter peace, continually en|crea&s;ing peace to the &s;oul. Whatever way, therefore, among&s;t numberle&s;s different ways, mo&s;t effectually promoteth and e&s;tab|li&s;heth this love, mu&s;t be the be&s;t of tho&s;e ways.</P>
<P>In other words, every man's own con|&s;cience will readily inform him, that to <HI>do ju&s;tly,</HI> to <HI>love mercy,</HI> and to <HI>walk humbly with our God,</HI> mu&s;t be the &s;ure road to happi|ne&s;s; and, what ju&s;tice and mercy mean, and what it is to render all due homage and prai&s;e to God, the &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, which is implanted in every man, will, in almo&s;t all ca&s;es, help us to di&s;cover. The prophet, therefore, &s;ays, <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good.</HI> And, the apo&s;tle
<PB N="16" REF="25">
Paul propo&s;es the que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Know ye not <HI>of your own &s;elves,</HI> what is right?"</Q> Again, he very con&s;i&s;tently teaches, that <HI>tho&s;e, who have not the law, are a law unto them&s;elves.</HI> And, though tho&s;e, who have not the law, could not, of them&s;elves, find out the law; yet, it is no &s;ooner propo&s;ed to them, all it precepts being &s;o plain and forcible, and &s;o exactly corre&s;pondent to the natural &s;entiments of the human mind, than they mu&s;t pronounce it to be holy, ju&s;t, and good.</P>
<P>The law of the go&s;pel in particular, is &s;o pure and heavenly, that we mu&s;t almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly acknowledge its divine au|thority; and is, at the &s;ame time, &s;o ob|vious, that <HI>he that runs may read it.</HI> To &s;ubmit our&s;elves entirely to the <HI>divine will,</HI> and to <HI>do to all others as we would be treated our&s;elves,</HI> is that very perfection for which we would naturally wi&s;h. But, this con|&s;picuou&s;ly manife&s;teth it&s;elf in every page of the go&s;pel, to be the &s;um of what God requires of us, as the candidates for his everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="26">
The prophet, therefore, calls the go&s;pel <HI>an high way;</HI> and adds, that <HI>the way-faring men, though fools, &s;hall not err therein.</HI> Our Lord, in like manner &s;ays, <HI>My yoke is ea&s;y, and my burthen is light:</HI> and, the apo&s;tle John, <HI>His commandments are not grievous.</HI></P>
<P>But, it is not <HI>argument,</HI> &s;o much as <HI>ex|perience,</HI> that impre&s;&s;es an irre&s;i&s;tible con|viction of tho&s;e truths upon the mind.</P>
<P>Argument, indeed, may fully &s;atisfy us, that <HI>the way of the wicked is as darkne&s;s,</HI> and that this way is clearly delineated, with all its concomitant horrors, in the go&s;pel; and again, that <HI>wi&s;dom's ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and that all her paths are peace;</HI> and that the&s;e ways are <HI>written,</HI> as with a <HI>diamond,</HI> in the &s;ame go&s;pel. But, it is <HI>ex|perience</HI> which makes every thing ea&s;y and endearing to us. When we can once be per&s;uaded to <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures</HI> as we ought, every difficulty concerning tho&s;e terms of acceptance which they pre&s;cribe, will gradually vani&s;h; and, the more we accu&s;tom our&s;elves to this divine &s;tudy, the more &s;hall we know, from the harmonious
<PB N="18" REF="27">
te&s;timony of the &s;pirit, and of our own &s;pirits, that the doctrines are of God.</P>
<P>As, then, we are furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient powers to acquire the knowledge of our duty, and as this is &s;o plain and ea&s;y to us, it hence demon&s;trably follows, in the third place, and as we are expre&s;sly taught in the words of the text, that we &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly exerci&s;e our&s;elves in the di&s;covery of it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus &s;aith the Lord, &s;tand in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k&mdash;where is the <HI>good way.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>It would be &s;uppo&s;ing that the Great God has in vain con&s;tituted us what we are, that is, capable of enquiry, if we were to think, at the &s;ame time, that he does not require, nor expect us to make any enquiry. It would, likewi&s;e, be offering the greate&s;t mockery to God, to expect from him any further directions, or &s;upernatural aids for finding out the good way, before we had fir&s;t carried into practice tho&s;e directions, which he has already abundantly given us.</P>
<P>If we would, therefore, give any honour to God, or do any ju&s;tice to our&s;elves, we
<PB N="19" REF="28">
mu&s;t arou&s;e all the powers within us, and apply the&s;e to all tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom, which both nature and revelation clearly inculcate: or, we mu&s;t give all diligence to <HI>know</HI> what we mu&s;t <HI>do</HI> to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;tians, this duty is peculiarly in|cumbent upon us. We cannot, otherwi&s;e, indeed, with any degree of con&s;i&s;tency, a&s;&s;ume the Chri&s;tian name. For our Lord expre&s;sly teaches that, if <HI>we would enter into life,</HI> we mu&s;t <HI>&s;eek,</HI> and <HI>&s;earch,</HI> and <HI>a&s;k,</HI> and <HI>watch,</HI> and <HI>pray;</HI> and the apo&s;tle di|rects us to <HI>prove all things,</HI> and to <HI>hold fa&s;t that which is good.</HI></P>
<P>Enquiry, therefore, is as nece&s;&s;ary as it is important; and &s;hould, therefore, be al|ways accounted of &s;upreme importance.</P>
<P>However the affairs of the world may attract our attention, or whatever number|le&s;s cares may continually pre&s;s around us, the prevailing language of our hearts ought to be, at all times, <HI>Wherewith &s;hall I come before the Lord, and bow my&s;elf before the Mo&s;t High?</HI> Or, <HI>what &s;hall we do to inherit eternal life?</HI> How &s;hall we try, &s;earch, and
<PB N="20" REF="29">
examine? Whence &s;hall we receive the greate&s;t light and a&s;&s;i&s;tance? By what mea|&s;ures &s;hall we mo&s;t effectually obtain the jewel of great price? What vices are to be di&s;carded? What practices are to be altered and amended? and, what affections are to be cultivated and improved?</P>
<P>After we have made the greate&s;t progre&s;s in this divine &s;cience, we &s;hould be &s;till putting the que&s;tion, with the young man in the go&s;pel, and with more humble and &s;erious di&s;po&s;itions, <HI>What lack I yet?</HI> What is farther to be done? What pa&s;&s;ions to be corrected? What new duties to be con&s;i|dered and pur&s;ued? And how &s;hall we go on advancing to greater perfection?</P>
<P>Thus only, indeed, can we walk worthy the high vocation with which we are called.</P>
<P>The contrary conduct unmans and un|chri&s;tianizes us; dive&s;ts us of our ration|ality; and degrades us not only to a level with inferior animals, but even to a level with the clods of the valley: and, as it di&s;covers &s;uch ingratitude to our Maker,
<PB N="21" REF="30">
and &s;o daring a contempt of his authority, mu&s;t, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily debar us of his favour. Yea, we mu&s;t finally, in the &s;e|vere&s;t terms, condemn and reproach our|&s;elves, as inexcu&s;ably guilty, and unworthy of everla&s;ting life, for having neglected the <HI>one thing needful;</HI> for having neglected <HI>this only,</HI> whil&s;t we were anxiou&s;ly inqui&s;itive about every thing that re&s;pected our inte|re&s;ts in this world.</P>
<P>We cannot, indeed, at pre&s;ent, offer any plea in ju&s;tification of our conduct, for be&s;towing more care upon the body than upon the mind; nor for making that an excu&s;e for omitting &s;piritual duties, which we would by no means allow as an excu&s;e for omitting any temporal concerns. If, for in&s;tance, when there is any competition between our duty and our pre&s;ent emolu|ments, we give the preference to this world, it is plain that the love of this world, and not the love of God, is the prevailing prin|ciple by which we are actuated. If, again, the influence of company, can prevail upon us to ab&s;ent our&s;elves from public wor&s;hip,
<PB N="22" REF="31">
when our hearts inform us, that this is an important duty, it is plain that we regard the plea&s;ure of our company more than the favour of God: and if we will not, in any ca&s;e, indeed in every ca&s;e, take tho&s;e pains to <HI>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which we al|ways readily take, <HI>for filthy lucre's &s;ake,</HI> it is plain, much too plain, that the com|mands of God, and his final approbation, are among&s;t the la&s;t of our concerns.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if we &s;uffer the great &s;alvation, which is propo&s;ed to us in the go&s;pel, to give way to any other object whatever; if this &s;alvation be not always, or at lea&s;t generally, &s;upreme in our affections, we mu&s;t confe&s;s our&s;elves unworthy of it, and, therefore, cannot rea&s;onably hope that we &s;hall at la&s;t be rewarded with it.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, therefore, examine our&s;elves, and <HI>&s;ee,</HI> that we prize <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> as much as <HI>profit;</HI> and that we labour as <HI>much,</HI> or in|deed <HI>more,</HI> for that bread which endureth to everla&s;ting life, than we do for that bread, which only pa&s;&s;eth into the belly,
<PB N="23" REF="32">
and then peri&s;heth. Or, as we are autho|rized, enabled, and commanded &s;o to do, as the apo&s;tle exhorteth, let us not be <HI>un|wi&s;e,</HI> but <HI>under&s;tanding what the will of the Lord is.</HI></P>
<P>But, having thus &s;hewn you, that, &s;ince God has graciou&s;ly furni&s;hed us with pow|ers for attaining the knowledge of our duty, and &s;ince he has moreover made this plain and ea&s;y to us, we &s;hould, therefore, exer|ci&s;e our&s;elves in the di&s;covery of it; I &s;hould now proceed to point out what &s;eems to be the be&s;t method of accom|pli&s;hing our purpo&s;e, and likewi&s;e to &s;hew, that <HI>obedience,</HI> as well as <HI>knowledge,</HI> is ex|pected from us. The&s;e con&s;iderations, however, with the conclu&s;ion of the whole, mu&s;t be re&s;erved for our next meditations.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;ider what we are, of what we are capable, what duties are required from us, and how fully and clearly the&s;e are made known to us; and let us, therefore, give glory to God, by vigorou&s;ly exerting tho&s;e faculties which he has given us, by making our

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JEREMIAH vi. 16.</BIBL>
<Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord, &s;tand ye in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t for your &s;ouls.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words I have already ob&s;erved, are a po&s;itive manife&s;tation of the in|finite compa&s;&s;ion and loving-kindne&s;s of God, even to <HI>&s;inners,</HI> to <HI>notorious</HI> and <HI>aban|doned</HI> &s;inners. He is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h. After we have <HI>for&s;aken him, the fountain of living waters, and hewed us out ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns, that can hold no</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="35">
<HI>water,</HI> he, even then, propo&s;eth <HI>re&s;t for our &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, then, we &s;ee, that this all-glo|rious Being is not, as he has been &s;ome|times bla&s;phemou&s;ly repre&s;ented, the enemy of any creature he has made, but <HI>rich in mercy unto all,</HI> from everla&s;ting; as adorable in his forbearance and long-&s;uffering, as for the a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;plays of his uncontroul|able power. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus &s;aith the Lord,"</Q> even to tho&s;e who had rejected his domi|nion over them, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Stand ye in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t for your &s;ouls."</Q></P>
<P>It is his plea&s;ure, therefore, to re&s;tore and perfect us, unle&s;s it be our own fault.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, the language of our text holds out this fir&s;t object to us, that he has furni&s;hed us with &s;ufficient powers to acquire the knowledge of our duty. For, as he is incapable of mocking the creatures of his power, it is therefore evident, &s;ince he has commanded us to <HI>&s;tand,</HI> and <HI>&s;ee,</HI> and
<PB N="27" REF="36">
<HI>enquire,</HI> where our true happine&s;s lies, that we can be obedient to the heavenly voice.</P>
<P>But, in the &s;econd place, we are like|wi&s;e informed, that the knowledge of our duty is plain and ea&s;y to us. We have only to <HI>&s;tand,</HI> and we &s;hall <HI>&s;ee;</HI> to <HI>&s;eek</HI> and we &s;hall <HI>find;</HI> to <HI>knock</HI> and it &s;hall be <HI>open|ed</HI> to us. It is not hidden from us, neither is it far off, but within the reach of every man who is &s;olicitous to obtain it.</P>
<P>Hence, it is obvious, in the third place, that we &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly exerci&s;e our&s;elves in di&s;covering the knowledge of our duty. This is our mo&s;t important &s;tudy: and, &s;ince the authority of the Supreme Being concurs, with our own a&s;&s;ured and deare&s;t intere&s;ts, to make us work out our own &s;alvation, we mu&s;t be inexcu&s;able, if we neglect it; we mu&s;t, indeed, be ab&s;olutely inexcu&s;able, if the <HI>great &s;alvation</HI> propo&s;ed to us, have not at all times the &s;overeign hold of our affections.</P>
<P>But having already, I hope, &s;ufficiently con&s;idered the preceding particulars, I &s;hall now proceed to enquire, in the fourth
<PB N="28" REF="37">
place, what is the be&s;t method of attaining the mo&s;t clear and &s;atisfactory knowledge of our duty.</P>
<P>Enquiry, I know, is repre&s;ented by &s;ome to be the mo&s;t dangerous way of proceed|ing that we can take; for, we are <HI>weak,</HI> they &s;ay, and <HI>fallible</HI> creatures, and the ma|jority of mankind have &s;o much of their time unavoidably devoted to the affairs of this life, that they cannot &s;ufficiently exa|mine, or di&s;cern truth; and that their only means, therefore, of keeping clear of er|rour, is to tru&s;t to the deci&s;ions of the learned, and &s;ubmit their opinions to their &s;uperior wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding all the artificial ar|guments that have been offered to this purpo&s;e, the only danger ari&s;ing from a free and impartial enquiry, is the danger of de|parting from irrational, antiquated, &s;y&s;tems, which have no &s;olid foundation, but are built upon <HI>hay, &s;traw, &s;tubble,</HI> and &s;uch corruptible materials, which will, there|fore, tumble down, as &s;oon as they are im|partially examined.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="38">
Learning, it is granted, is of un&s;peak|able advantage to the &s;incere, and unbia&s;&s;ed lovers of truth.</P>
<P>But there are men of great learning, who, through their early imbibed preju|dices, and the &s;ub&s;equent, &s;oporiferous, golden charms, of their particular &s;itua|tions, have been tempted to apply all their learning in the defence of &s;elf-evident con|tradictions.</P>
<P>Of what u&s;e is all that learning of a Hor&s;ley, and a Hurd, which they have em|ployed in &s;upport of a Trinity; and which may with propriety be termed &s;ophi&s;tical quibbling?</P>
<P>As an expert arithmetician may puzzle us upon a variety of que&s;tions, without be|ing able to convince us that two and two are not equal to four; they may confound, and overwhelm us with metaphy&s;ical &s;ub|tleties, but can never per&s;uade us, unle&s;s we previou&s;ly become apo&s;tates to common &s;en&s;e, that one indivi&s;ible e&s;&s;ence is com|po&s;ed of three di&s;tinct per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="39">
Be&s;ides, if after the mo&s;t exten&s;ive en|quiry, we &s;hould &s;till be found to embrace &s;ome erroneous &s;entiments, we can certain|ly do no honour to God, by counteracting the clear deci&s;ions of our own minds, but mu&s;t, on the contrary, by this conduct, incur his di&s;plea&s;ure. For he requires us to &s;erve him according to <HI>our own</HI> under|&s;tandings, and not according to the under|&s;tanding of any <HI>other man,</HI> or of any <HI>body</HI> of men.</P>
<P>As we have &s;een, therefore, that God has commanded us to enquire, unque&s;tion|able experience will &s;oon convince us, that an hone&s;t, unbia&s;&s;ed enquiry will lead us &s;till farther and farther into all truth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we have already &s;een that the knowledge of our duty, is not beyond the reach of any man, but is plain and ea&s;y to every man, who only de&s;ires to under&s;tand it, and re&s;olves to examine into it. The &s;pread of errour is never to be a&s;cribed to the <HI>incapacity,</HI> but, on the contrary, to the <HI>indolence</HI> of man; or to his wayward lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, which make him wilfully
<PB N="31" REF="40">
blind or ob&s;tinately incorrigible. Let the&s;e ob&s;tacles be but once removed, and then we &s;hall have only to <HI>a&s;k,</HI> as we are direct|ed in the text, which of the <HI>old paths</HI> is the <HI>good way,</HI> and it will immediately offer it&s;elf to our view.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, then, we mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, e&s;pecially endeavour to lay a&s;ide all prejudice; and not determine that <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>that</HI> is the good way, but <HI>a&s;k</HI> or examine, which, among&s;t the very different ways that are pre&s;ented to us, is the <HI>be&s;t</HI> way.</P>
<P>It is farther to be ob&s;erved, that, by be|ing directed to a&s;k for the <HI>good</HI> way, it is not intended that we &s;hould a&s;k for that way which is crouded with the greate&s;t numbers; or for that way in which our fa|thers have walked; or for that way which is mo&s;t frequented by tho&s;e who are ac|counted the <HI>great</HI> and the <HI>wi&s;e;</HI> but for <HI>that</HI> way which mo&s;t effectually promoteth goodne&s;s among&s;t men, which will afford them the greate&s;t peace and &s;ecurity whil&s;t they are in it, and which, in the end, will

<P>But it is, farther, evidently implied in our being directed to a&s;k, or enquire at all, that we are expected to make u&s;e of our <HI>own rea&s;on,</HI> and not yield an implicit faith to any doctrines, however univer&s;al, be|cau&s;e <HI>others</HI> may believe the&s;e doctrines to be true, or the magi&s;trate may have &s;et his <HI>&s;eal of orthodoxy</HI> upon them.

Otherwi&s;e, we &s;hould have been directed, in&s;tead of exerting our own faculties, only to a&s;k of the <HI>pope,</HI> or of our <HI>prie&s;ts,</HI> or of our <HI>governors;</HI> and to do ju&s;t as they com|mand us.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="42">
It is plainly ridiculous, therefore, and contrary to the divine admonition in the text, to profe&s;s any doctrines, or any re|ligion, merely becau&s;e the&s;e have been the doctrines or the religion of our <HI>an|ce&s;tors,</HI> or the doctrines or religion of the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> or <HI>our own</HI> doctrines or religion in time pa&s;t.</P>
<P>As rational beings we can in reality pro|fe&s;s nothing, but what has approved it&s;elf to our impartial enquiry: and, whatever too, after &s;ucce&s;&s;ive enquiries, &s;hall appear to us to be wrong, we are, as rational be|ings, bound to for&s;ake and oppo&s;e, how|ever long we may have been accu&s;tomed to it, by whatever numbers it may &s;till be countenanced, and by whatever authority it may continue to be &s;upported.</P>
<P>But, it is farther to be ob&s;erved, that, when we are taught to a&s;k for the <HI>old paths,</HI> it is not by this intended to be &s;ignified, that whatever, comparing things with things, has the greate&s;t antiquity on its &s;ide, is, for this rea&s;on, the <HI>be&s;t.</HI> For idolatry is older than the Mo&s;aic religion;

and this, again, is older than Chri&s;tianity. Popery, likewi&s;e, is older than the refor|mation: though the mo&s;t excellent way of all is much older than popery. In &s;hort, if the claim to antiquity were to direct us in our choice of &s;y&s;tems, be&s;ides renouncing the exerci&s;e of our mental fa|culties, we mu&s;t run the hazard of falling into numberle&s;s mon&s;trous corruptions. It is, al&s;o, to be con&s;idered, that we might di&s;pute for ever, which of &s;o many &s;y&s;tems that could be mentioned was the mo&s;t an|tient.</P>
<P>To prevent our being bewildered, then, in this matter, we are directed to a&s;k for the <HI>good</HI> way as well as for the <HI>old</HI> way: which is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, as if we had been directed to a&s;k, which among&s;t the <HI>old</HI> ways is the <HI>be&s;t</HI> way, or which &s;eems to be mo&s;t fully approved, and recommended to us, by the Fountain of all wi&s;dom and knowledge.</P>
<P>Now our only &s;ucce&s;sful method of di&s;|covering this, is to judge of all the dif|ferent religions that are propo&s;ed to us, ac|cording
<PB N="35" REF="46">
to that rea&s;on and con&s;cience which God has graciou&s;ly given us. The&s;e are the primary lights of heaven to mortals in their journey through life. And, if we only examine all the different religions in the world by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e pure and infallible guides, we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cern which is the mo&s;t perfect, or which is mo&s;t fully calculated, for promoting the rea&s;on|able, &s;piritual, wor&s;hip of the infinitely wi&s;e and righteous, moral Governour of the world, and the Father of our &s;pirits; or which mo&s;t clearly and forcibly teaches the mo&s;t exalted, and univer&s;al love of God and man.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to determine this point, I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the <HI>old paths</HI> to which the Jews were directed in the text, might &s;ignify that way of holine&s;s which God had e&s;tabli&s;hed from everla&s;ting; or rather <HI>tho&s;e te&s;timonies</HI> that were delivered to them by Mo&s;es, and which might be called <HI>old paths,</HI> when compared with their own later wicked inventions, for which all the prophets &s;ucce&s;&s;ively threat|ened
<PB N="36" REF="47">
and condemned them. And the pre|cept to them was of the &s;ame force, as if they had been taught to compare their own impious ways with tho&s;e ways which God their Redeemer had taught them of old, and been directed to walk in the good way.</P>
<P>But when we apply the direction in the text to our&s;elves, it mu&s;t not then be un|der&s;tood to lead us back to the <HI>law,</HI> but, on the contrary, to e&s;tabli&s;h us in the good way of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> in this be&s;t of all tho&s;e ways, which the divine wi&s;dom has ap|pointed, and enabled us to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the go&s;pel appeared, the law, which was &s;uited to different times and cir|cum&s;tances, could no longer be con&s;idered, when compared with it, to be the good way. And the more we now examine the go&s;pel, the more and more will it approve it&s;elf, of all the different ways which the children of men have cho&s;en from the foundation of the world, to be the mo&s;t &s;ure and plain way. All other ways, when compared with it, will appear dark and
<PB N="37" REF="48">
crooked. This will be found to be mo&s;t <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>peaceable,</HI> mo&s;t <HI>gentle</HI> and <HI>ea&s;y to be entreated,</HI> mo&s;t abounding in all <HI>mercy and good fruits,</HI> and without any <HI>partiality</HI> or <HI>hypocri&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>In other words, if we enquire, and exa|mine, for ever, with a con&s;tant eye to truth, and to truth only, the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t will be found to be the mo&s;t clear, and only infallible way to eternal life. <HI>Him</HI> hath <HI>the Father &s;ealed,</HI> and Him hath the Father appointed to be the King and Head of his church. He was anointed with the &s;pirit above mea&s;ure. He was filled with the fulne&s;s of God. He &s;poke &s;o as never man &s;poke. He, therefore, is the truly <HI>good</HI> way, and the <HI>living</HI> way unto the Father.</P>
<P>But here I may remark, that it is only becau&s;e the mo&s;t impartial enquiry mu&s;t convince us of this, that we are required to con&s;ider him as &s;uch. Je&s;us, though he had all nece&s;&s;ary power from the Father, never claimed, notwith&s;tanding, that au|thority which many of his pretended &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors
<PB N="38" REF="49">
have a&s;&s;umed. He required our be|lief in him&s;elf, only upon the &s;trength of tho&s;e te&s;timonies which the Father had given men of him. He amply confirmed his di|vine mi&s;&s;ion, by numberle&s;s mo&s;t incon|te&s;table miracles. And we know, that with <HI>him the Father was always well plea&s;ed,</HI> becau&s;e He has rai&s;ed him from the dead, and taken him up into heaven, and poured out the holy Spirit upon the apo&s;tles after him. And we may, likewi&s;e, always know, from <HI>the doctrines them&s;elves,</HI> if we delibe|rately examine them according to that &s;en&s;e of right and wrong which is originally made a part of our con&s;titution, that <HI>they are,</HI> demon&s;trably, <HI>from God.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t, once more, ob&s;erve upon this head, that the good way which Je&s;us taught is to be learned only from him&s;elf. He gave no power to his followers to ex|erci&s;e power over one another; nor ap|pointed any &s;et of fallible men to lead us blindfold in what they may decide to be his way. All human e&s;tabli&s;hments, there|fore, and all creeds and confe&s;&s;ions of faith,
<PB N="39" REF="50">
compo&s;ed by men, are contrary to this way. This way is to be known only from tho&s;e who heard him; and this, again, only from their own unque&s;tionable records. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are the <HI>good, old paths,</HI> to all Chri&s;tians. All human additions to the&s;e paths, in|&s;tead of making them more plain, will only confound and mi&s;lead us.</P>
<P>Though we may, therefore, profitably u&s;e our commentators as helps, we mu&s;t lay them a&s;ide as guides: we mu&s;t reject all public acts of orthodoxy, and adhere to the New Te&s;tament only, if we would pre&s;s right forward to our be&s;t intere&s;ts. This, of it&s;elf, independently of all the different explications of it, that have been given by different men, and by different churches, is <HI>the wi&s;dom that de&s;cended from above.</HI> We need only read, to &s;ee, and know this. We have only to read the &s;criptures daily, without prejudice, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to endeavour, whil&s;t we read, to forget all other knowledge, and we &s;hall feel with joy, from that peace of God which they admini&s;ter to our hearts, that we are in the
<PB N="40" REF="51">
<HI>good</HI> way. Experience will &s;oon convince us, that the&s;e are the really good way. The farther we extend our enquiries, the more clearly, and certainly, &s;hall we know, that <HI>the&s;e are &s;pirit,</HI> and that <HI>the&s;e are life;</HI> and that our &s;ouls can re&s;t fully &s;atisfied upon no other ground.</P>
<P>But having thus &s;hewn, which &s;eems to be the be&s;t method of acquiring a thorough knowledge of our duty; and, at the &s;ame time, con&s;idered where this know|ledge is revealed to us; it now remains to be briefly remarked, in the la&s;t place, that it is not &s;ufficient to have found, by the full exerci&s;e of tho&s;e faculties which God has given us, which is the good way, and to acknowledge no other, but that we mu&s;t, likewi&s;e, <HI>walk therein,</HI> if we would &s;eri|ou&s;ly &s;tudy to approve our&s;elves to God. <HI>Stand in the ways, and &s;ee which is the good way, and walk therein, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>To know the be&s;t way, in any ca&s;e, can be of no advantage to us, if we walk in another way. To know the go&s;pel, then, to be the way of <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> and at the &s;ame
<PB N="41" REF="52">
time, to live in allowed <HI>wickedne&s;s;</HI> or to know the go&s;pel to admit no <HI>encroachments upon con&s;cience,</HI> and, at the &s;ame time, to refu&s;e <HI>liberty of con&s;cience to others;</HI> or to know the go&s;pel to be <HI>of it&s;elf perfect,</HI> and at the &s;ame time to &s;ubmit to manife&s;t <HI>cor|rupt additions</HI> to it; or to give any counte|nance to <HI>human authority</HI> in matters of faith, whil&s;t we know the go&s;pel to be again&s;t <HI>all</HI> &s;uch <HI>human authority,</HI> mu&s;t render us un|worthy of the go&s;pel, mu&s;t confe&s;&s;edly de|bar us of all its benefits, and likewi&s;e ag|gravate our guilt and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Our Lord, therefore, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If ye <HI>know</HI> the&s;e things, happy are ye if ye <HI>do</HI> them."</Q> And the apo&s;tle James, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"faith with|out works is dead."</Q> And the apo&s;tle Paul, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the gift of prophecy, and of working of miracles, and all other &s;pi|ritual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, are nothing, without brotherly love."</Q></P>
<P>As Chri&s;tians, then, to apply to our&s;elves the directions of the text, and, at the &s;ame time, to derive any con&s;olation from them, we mu&s;t not only know what is that pure
<PB N="42" REF="53">
faith, which was once delivered to the &s;aints, but we mu&s;t, likewi&s;e, in all re|&s;pects, act &s;uitably to it. We mu&s;t en|deavour to be &s;ober and temperate, gentle and peaceable, pure in heart, holy in all manner of conver&s;ation, without wrath or animo&s;ity, kind and merciful, and walk|ing humbly with our God, ever meditating upon his goodne&s;s, adoring him for all his benefits, and chearfully acquie&s;cing in all his di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>Thus our Lord him&s;elf applied the words, when he &s;aid, <HI>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>The word, which is here rendered <HI>re&s;t,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>refre&s;hment.</HI> And the knowledge and practice of the go&s;pel, and a con&s;tant imitation of our &s;potle&s;s guide and conduc|tor, mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, above all other ob|jects whatever, <HI>refre&s;h</HI> us even in this life. We cannot faint in the way, whil&s;t we walk in the light of <HI>heaven,</HI> and perceive that we are led by this light <HI>to</HI> heaven. What, indeed, can di&s;courage us, or make
<PB N="43" REF="54">
us afraid, when we con&s;ider that the con|clu&s;ion of the whole will be everla&s;ting life; or tho&s;e refre&s;hing, and infinitely &s;atisfying plea&s;ures, which flow at God's right hand for evermore? This was the grand object, for which the in&s;tructions in the text, and all the other divine admonitions that occur to us in the &s;criptures, were originally given. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus, &s;aith the Lord, &s;tand in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye &s;hall find <HI>re&s;t for your &s;ouls.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Let us now, then, by way of improve|ment of what has been &s;aid, be taught, in the fir&s;t place, to fix our thoughts upon this grand object.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;t</HI> for the <HI>&s;oul!</HI> This is the mo&s;t de|&s;irable re&s;t. This is a &s;ufficient compen|&s;ation for all troubles. This includes in it the removal of the bittere&s;t &s;orrows; the removal of the burthen of &s;in, and &s;hame, and death; and, likewi&s;e, the en|joyment of God to all eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="55">
This, then, is every thing that we can hope, or wi&s;h, or labour for.</P>
<P>Compared with this, what is the world; and what are the things of the world? What are millions of worlds? What are all their wealth and honours? What are all the plea&s;ures, and gratifications, that can be prepared for the body? What is fame? What is wi&s;dom? What is health, and what is life it&s;elf?</P>
<P>The &s;un, and the moon, and the planets, and the world, and every thing that we &s;ee around us will vani&s;h and be forgotten; or, if they were to continue for ever, will all &s;oon be of no kind of u&s;e to us. The body it&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon pa&s;s away. Be&s;ides, all its joys are momentary: they are, moreover, un&s;atisfying. Our health, and all our other pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are tran&s;ient as the clouds that fly over our heads.</P>
<P>But when we once find <HI>re&s;t for our &s;ouls,</HI> we &s;hall find that which can never be taken away from us; which is beyond the reach of every change, or accident.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56">
We can, then, look forward to an in|conceivable fulne&s;s of perpetually encrea&s;ing bli&s;s, through all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive moments of a boundle&s;s eternity, as our own. We can, then, look up to the great God as our &s;anc|tuary, and everla&s;ting Friend. We can, then, anticipate with the highe&s;t delight, our approaching communion and fellow|&s;hip with Je&s;us, and with all the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect. And we can, then, &s;tem the torrent of every affliction that &s;hall befal us here, in hope of the glory here|after to be revealed. For this is enough. This is the jewel of great price.</P>
<P>But nothing el&s;e is enough.</P>
<P>Could we &s;urround the four quarters of the globe, and call every part of them our own, yet we know the time would come, when we &s;hould be con&s;trained, however reluctantly, to confe&s;s, that all was vanity and vexation of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>But the &s;oul that entereth that re&s;t, which the Lord has propo&s;ed to us, &s;hall live for ever, and &s;hall have full enjoyment for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="57">
Here, then, let us fix our thoughts. Let us command down every high and proud imagination. Let us triumph over all the blandi&s;hments of &s;en&s;e, over every anxious care, over every &s;lothful habit, and over every &s;inful pa&s;&s;ion; and let us lay up for our&s;elves trea&s;ures in heaven.</P>
<P>But let us be taught, in the &s;econd place, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, admire, and adore, the wonderful goodne&s;s and mo&s;t marvellous loving kindne&s;s of God, who has called us to <HI>this re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>What are we, the beings but of ye&s;ter|day, that we &s;hould be begotten unto &s;uch lively hopes? To what could all our &s;er|vices amount; or, what could they merit, had we even never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, in thought, or word, or deed?</P>
<P>But we have &s;inned, and fallen &s;hort of the glory of God. We &s;hould have often cut our&s;elves off from his favour, and in|curred his di&s;plea&s;ure, were he not infinite|ly gracious and long &s;uffering.</P>
<P>And yet, he hath &s;pared us. He yet continueth to offer to us his pardon and re|conciliation.
<PB N="47" REF="58">
He yet entreateth us, by all his prophets, and by his own Son, to turn unto him that he may have mercy upon us. He, even now, would refre&s;h our &s;ouls; refre&s;h our &s;ouls for ever!</P>
<P>How, then, &s;hould we prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</P>
<P>It is owing to his mercies that we are not con&s;umed: &s;till, he is willing to introduce us to all the riches of eternal life!</P>
<P>How &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all de&s;cription is &s;uch love! How endearing! How joyful! How overwhelming to the attentive mind! And, how worthy our daily thank&s;givings, and our con&s;tant, and devoute&s;t meditations! God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting life. Mo&s;t emphatically, then, may He be &s;tiled, <HI>The Father of all Mercies!</HI></P>
<P>Let us, therefore, be taught, in the third place, not to walk unworthy of &s;uch good|ne&s;s, nor to abu&s;e the riches of that for|bearance and long-&s;uffering, which would
<PB N="48" REF="59">
lead us to repentance. Let us, therefore, &s;hake off every idle habit, and indolent di&s;|po&s;ition, and &s;eek the things that belong to our peace, before they be hid from our eyes.</P>
<P>God hath called us with an holy calling. Let us be obedient to the heavenly voice.</P>
<P>God hath given us rea&s;on to examine, and an under&s;tanding to know the things that are true. Let us exerci&s;e and improve the great talents committed to our tru&s;t. Let us awaken all the powers within us, and with the&s;e divine a&s;&s;i&s;tants, look well about us; con&s;ider his perfections and will; and, all pride, and prejudices, and tempo|ral intere&s;ts a&s;ide, &s;earch out all the duties that we owe him.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, otherwi&s;e, remain in ignorance, be agitated with various tumultuous doubts and fears, and be continually to&s;&s;ed about by every wind of doctrine, or lo&s;t in the de&s;tructive current of irre&s;i&s;table tempta|tions. And our &s;ituation will be as inex|cu&s;able as it is deplorable; becau&s;e God has commanded and enabled us to keep clear
<PB N="49" REF="60">
of all difficulties, and al&s;o made our duty plain and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Let us not, then, be &s;uch enemies to our&s;elves, as to contemn his gifts, or to &s;uffer them to become languid, or u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Particularly, after we &s;hall have &s;epa|rated the wheat from the chaff; broken through every cloud of darkne&s;s; &s;een the light in its full &s;plendour, or <HI>found out</HI> the <HI>good</HI> way, let us walk therein.

<P>We are, accordingly, informed from the be&s;t authority, that that &s;ervant who knew his Lord's will, and did not according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes.</P>
<P>As we again learn, <HI>Obedience is better than &s;acrifice; and the knowledge,</HI> that is, <HI>the ac|knowledgement of the Lord,</HI> or an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all his plea&s;ure, <HI>more than whole burnt offerings.</HI></P>

<P>AS man is capacitated to <HI>know,</HI> and to <HI>under&s;tand</HI> the things that are true, whil&s;t it is clearly the will of the &s;overeign Jehovah, that we &s;hould apply the facul|ties he has given us to tho&s;e wi&s;e and ex|cellent purpo&s;es for which they were be|&s;towed; and as the health, &s;trength, and enjoyment of the mind, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily depend on our endeavours to fulfil the noble de&s;igns of our Creator, I have, therefore, &s;hewn you, that enquiry is a mo&s;t impor|tant and e&s;&s;ential duty; as honourable to our nature, as it is &s;uitable to that rank we hold among&s;t the immen&s;ity of the works of God.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="63">
Again, &s;ince a free and impartial enquiry mu&s;t finally open to our view the holy &s;criptures, as a full, perfect, &s;atisfying, and unerring guide to eternal life; it hence demon&s;trably follows, that we &s;hould par|ticularly, con&s;tantly, and &s;eriou&s;ly examine the&s;e, that, from our frequent and intimate intercour&s;e with tho&s;e divine in&s;tructions which they contain, we may build our|&s;elves up in our holy faith, and make, daily, nearer approaches to the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, until we &s;hall at length have reached the &s;ummit of that perfection to which we are called.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, immediately perceive the force of the direction in the text; and what reverential attention and obedience it demands.</P>

This people both gloried in the &s;criptures as a rule of life, and in their exact knowledge of them; and yet, at the &s;ame time, rejected the long-expected Me&s;&s;iah, who was &s;o fully and circum&s;tantially pointed out to them in the&s;e very &s;criptures. After our Lord, therefore, in the preceding ver&s;es, had ex|po&s;ed their great ob&s;tinacy and hardne&s;s of heart, in not only not receiving that te&s;ti|mony which John had given them of him, but in not even receiving that te&s;timony which the Father him&s;elf had given them; he convicted them, likewi&s;e, in the words of the text, of the greate&s;t blindne&s;s and igno|rance, in not admitting that te&s;timony which &s;o fully abounded in their own &s;crip|tures concerning him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Search the &s;crip|tures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and the&s;e be they which te&s;tify of me."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="65">
Now tho&s;e &s;criptures to which our Lord here evidently referred, were only the &s;crip|tures of the Old Te&s;tament; for the &s;crip|tures of the New Te&s;tament had not as yet been fully revealed, nor had any part of them been committed to writing until &s;everal years after.</P>
<P>It is plain, however, from the argument &s;ubjoined, and on which our Lord founded his direction to the Jews, that the &s;ame di|rection, when applied to our&s;elves, implies that we are particularly required, and con|&s;trained, to &s;earch the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament. For, if it was incum|bent on the Jews to &s;earch the &s;criptures of the Old Te&s;tament, becau&s;e the&s;e te&s;ti|fied of Chri&s;t, or predicted the time, and manner, and de&s;ign of his coming, and his glorious atchievements over &s;in and death; we certainly, much more, ought to &s;earch the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament, which &s;o circum&s;tantially relate all the ac|tions of Chri&s;t, his life, and death, and re|&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion, and likewi&s;e all
<PB N="55" REF="66">
his doctrines and promi&s;es; which, in &s;hort, &s;hew us the one Sovereign in all the riches of his love, and are the true and living way to the Father and eternal life.</P>
<P>But, having thus briefly proved, that though our Lord, in addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Jews, &s;pake only of the &s;criptures of the Old Te&s;tament, the precept, notwith|&s;tanding, now fairly implies, and with addi|tional energy, our obligations to &s;earch, likewi&s;e, the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;ta|ment, or the whole &s;criptures as they are at pre&s;ent commonly received among&s;t Chri&s;tians; I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew, with|out any farther introduction, <HI>why,</HI> and how, we &s;hould apply our&s;elves to &s;earch the&s;e &s;criptures: and, as this is a &s;ubject of great importance, and to which I have paid &s;ome attention, I &s;hall con&s;ider it more fully than I generally do mo&s;t others that come be|fore us.</P>
<P>We cannot, it is obvious, much concern our&s;elves <HI>how</HI> we &s;hould &s;earch the &s;crip|tures, nor indeed anxiou&s;ly attend to any rules that can be given us on this head,
<PB N="56" REF="67">
unle&s;s we be fir&s;t convinced that we are under &s;ome particular obligations to &s;earch them; and, in proportion as the&s;e &s;hall be found the more or le&s;s weighty and im|portant, we &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily be the more or le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to ob&s;erve &s;uch directions as offer them&s;elves to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, fir&s;t, endeavour to fur|ni&s;h you with the rea&s;ons, or arguments, why we &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly exerci&s;e our&s;elves in &s;earching the &s;criptures. And all the&s;e, I think, may be comprized under the fol|lowing particulars: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Becau&s;e we profe&s;s them to be our rule of life; becau&s;e they contain the pure te&s;timonies concerning Chri&s;t, whom we acknowledge to be the mo&s;t endearing Me&s;&s;enger of the grace of God; becau&s;e they are, manife&s;tly, the will of the mo&s;t high God revealed to us; becau&s;e they contain the mo&s;t excel|lent and important knowledge; becau&s;e they are our be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t vice, and our &s;ure guide to perfection; becau&s;e they are even able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation; and becau&s;e they are never
<PB N="57" REF="68">
weari&s;ome nor di&s;gu&s;ting to the &s;erious reader.'</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t argument that I &s;hall mention <HI>why</HI> we &s;hould &s;earch the &s;criptures is, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'becau&s;e we profe&s;s them to be our rule of life.'</Q></P>
<P>Even this argument is a good one: for,</P>
<P>We would, certainly, always choo&s;e to act a manly and honourable part, and not to appear in the light of tho&s;e, who are ever running they know not whither, or a&s;&s;uming a character to which they are perfect &s;trangers; and we would not wil|lingly be accounted irrational creatures, nor become objects of contempt to every capa|ble judge, who makes any enquiry into our conduct.</P>
<P>But it needs &s;carcely to be ob&s;erved, that it is always reproachful to us to be ignorant of our profe&s;&s;ion, whatever this be.</P>
<P>We could not &s;uppre&s;s our indignation again&s;t the man who &s;hould attempt to teach the &s;ciences, without having ever learned to read; or teach to read, without being acquainted with the alphabet.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="69">
Even to make profe&s;&s;ion of any common trade, and to appear con&s;tantly in the habi|liments of tho&s;e who u&s;ually exerci&s;e this trade, and, at the &s;ame time, to be totally ignorant both of the theory and the prac|tice of it, renders a man ridiculous and de&s;picable: but, to be an entire &s;tranger to his religious profe&s;&s;ion, renders a man &s;till more ridiculous and de&s;picable; indeed, lays a ju&s;t foundation of not only charging him with folly and pre&s;umption, but of charging him even with madne&s;s.</P>
<P>For religion is not a concern between man and man, but between man and the Great Ruler of the univer&s;e. It is not a concern which affects us, as members of &s;ociety only, but as the creatures and &s;ub|jects of Almighty God. Nor is it an ob|ject which merely re&s;pects our condition in this world, but which re&s;pects our condi|tion through eternity.</P>
<P>To pretend, then, that we have con&s;i|dered our obligations to God, which is implied in our making any profe&s;&s;ion of religion; and to pretend that we know what
<PB N="59" REF="70">
the&s;e obligations are, and that we de&s;ire to give them their due influence upon our minds; and, at the &s;ame time, never to have &s;tudied them; never to have under|&s;tood any thing about them; never to have known but they might be the very con|trary to what we would be thought to &s;up|po&s;e them; and evidently not to care, whe|ther they be &s;uch or not, is not only acting the fool and the deceiver in the face of man, but is offering a high mockery to God, our omnipotent Creator, our omni&s;|cient Governor, and our &s;upreme Judge.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as rational, &s;piritual, and intel|ligent beings, it reflects the greate&s;t di&s;|grace upon us, to ri&s;e no higher than the bea&s;ts of the field; to be found in a &s;loth|ful and indolent &s;tate; and not to furni&s;h the mind, our better part, with &s;uch excel|lent employments as are &s;uitable to it.</P>
<P>We &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider that, whil&s;t we give way to &s;uch degrading indolence, we may, with the &s;hew of honouring our profe&s;&s;ion, load it with infamy; and whil&s;t we think we are &s;ucce&s;sfully vindicating it,
<PB N="60" REF="71">
be, in fact, railing again&s;t it in bitter lan|guage, and be only vindicating, under the name of it, &s;ome vile &s;uper&s;tition, which is, in every particular, flatly repugnant to it.</P>
<P>In this manner, the Roman Catholic, and all the members of e&s;tabli&s;hed churches, when vindicating popery, or any of their other different e&s;tabli&s;hments, are, at the &s;ame time, reviling chri&s;tianity; becau&s;e they are labouring to ju&s;tify what is at irre|concileable variance with it: and, whil&s;t this is the ca&s;e, we mu&s;t be liable to be to&s;&s;ed about with every wind of doctrine; to be bewildered with our own ignorance; and to &s;tumble, every moment, upon our own ab&s;urdities: for, being novices upon the &s;ubject, we cannot know what to de|fend, or what to oppo&s;e, when any attack is made upon us. We mu&s;t, therefore, when drawn into a controver&s;y, or when forced to give our opinion upon any &s;ubject that may be introduced, become the je&s;t of our neighbours, and a ju&s;t object of contempt to our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="72">
In other words, when one calls him&s;elf a Pre&s;byterian; when another calls him&s;elf an Epi&s;copalian; when others call them|&s;elves members of different religious pro|fe&s;&s;ions; and neither of them can give any account of the principles of tho&s;e &s;ects, to which they have &s;everally united them|&s;elves, they appear exactly in the light of a man, who calls him&s;elf an architect, without being able to explain any of the principles of architecture. Thus ridicu|lous is the man, who calls him&s;elf a church|man, without being acquainted with the meaning of the word church; and the man, who calls him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, whil&s;t he is ignorant of the fir&s;t principles of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>We ought, therefore, either to make no profe&s;&s;ion at all, or frequently to &s;earch the &s;criptures, were it for no other rea&s;on than this, that we may &s;hew our&s;elves men, who have under&s;tandings as well as other men; or that we may maintain our claim to ra|tionality, by being able to give to every one who a&s;keth a rea&s;on of the hope that is in
<PB N="62" REF="73">
us, or which we virtually announce to the world to be in us.</P>
<P>But, &s;econdly, a principal argument <HI>why</HI> we &s;hould &s;earch the &s;criptures, is becau&s;e they contain the pure te&s;timonies concern|ing Chri&s;t, whom we acknowledge to be the heavenly anointed, and the mo&s;t en|dearing Me&s;&s;enger of the grace of God.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een how much it be|hoves us to be acquainted with our profe&s;|&s;ions, were it only to e&s;cape contempt. This obligation, then, will encrea&s;e and &s;trengthen, in proportion to the dignity and importance of the profe&s;&s;ion we make, and the high excellence we a&s;cribe to it.</P>
<P>We would not choo&s;e to appear igno|rant of the beauty and intrin&s;ic worth of any precious jewel in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor to be found, when a&s;ked, incapable of giving any &s;atisfactory kind of de&s;cription of it. Much le&s;s would we choo&s;e to be found boa&s;ting of &s;ome un&s;peakable trea&s;ure, pre|tended to be in our hands, when, for ought we knew, what we e&s;teemed &s;uch, might be only an imaginary good, or &s;omething di&s;|gu&s;ting
<PB N="63" REF="74">
and burthen&s;ome, or detrimental to us. But this mu&s;t be exactly our condi|tion, when we glory in the go&s;pel as our be&s;t inheritance, and, at the &s;ame time, have never known, nor examined, the de|&s;ign of the go&s;pel; nor in any re&s;pect con|&s;idered, whether it really be what it has been reported to us, and what we our&s;elves have u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as we mu&s;t naturally de&s;ire to render &s;upreme homage to God for his greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, it is nece&s;&s;ary, to this pur|po&s;e, that we previou&s;ly know why any par|ticular ble&s;&s;ing is accounted &s;uch: other|wi&s;e, we cannot offer to him a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, but may &s;o far impo&s;e upon our|&s;elves, as to con&s;ider, as his ble&s;&s;ings, the &s;nares and delu&s;ions of the wicked, and all tho&s;e things that are mo&s;t inimical to us, and which have a direct tendency to make us unmindful of his mo&s;t e&s;timable ble&s;|&s;ings.</P>
<P>Let it be &s;till farther ob&s;erved, that, as it is in Him we live, and move, and have our being; and as we &s;hould, therefore, be|behold
<PB N="64" REF="75">
him as the author of every good and perfect gift; we &s;hould, in the&s;e circum|&s;tances, be thankful for all tho&s;e benefits which we receive at his hands.</P>
<P>But, how can we be thankful for we know not what? And, how can we be &s;uf|ficiently and devoutly thankful for the greate&s;t benefits, unle&s;s we particularly, and &s;eriou&s;ly, con&s;ider, what the&s;e benefits are; whence they flow upon us; and how unmerited they are?</P>
<P>If we would not, therefore, be guilty of uttering expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, without any meaning: or, rather, if we would not be found de&s;titute of every principle of real gratitude to the God who made us, we mu&s;t &s;earch the &s;criptures, that we may be acquainted with tho&s;e trea&s;ures of grace which they contain, or learn from them the marvellous extent of his great mercy towards us.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as by calling our&s;elves Chri&s;ti|ans, we declare our&s;elves the followers of Chri&s;t, we ought to have &s;ome idea of the
<PB N="65" REF="76">
nature of his kingdom, &s;ince, otherwi&s;e, we might as well pa&s;s under the name of the di&s;ciples of Mahomed or Confucius. For, who can, with any propriety, be &s;tiled his follower, who knows not what Chri&s;t him&s;elf was, or what he taught, and required of men?</P>
<P>But how can this be ever known, un|le&s;s we apply our&s;elves to the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures?</P>
<P>The&s;e are the only pure te&s;timonies con|cerning Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>All our authentic information, either concerning him, or his doctrines, mu&s;t be ultimately derived from the&s;e; for it is to be found no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>If we look for this information to any other fountain, we may be wholly deceived; find his plaine&s;t doctrines perverted, and his glorious character &s;hamefully deba&s;ed, and totally mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>But, in the &s;criptures, we have a parti|cular and genuine account of all the pro|phecies relating to him, preceding his birth; and, again, of all tho&s;e prophecies
<PB N="66" REF="77">
exactly fulfilled in his per&s;on. We, here, di&s;tinctly learn what he was, whence he came, what he taught, in what promi&s;es we are led to tru&s;t, and who are the chil|dren of his kingdom, and the heirs of eter|nal life.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we pre&s;ume, therefore, even to name the name of Chri&s;t, we &s;hould &s;earch the &s;criptures, to know upon what foun|dation we &s;tand, or what we are to expect or hope.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e, be a contradiction, and walk in thick darkne&s;s, whil&s;t we would be accounted the children of the light. We mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e, be in the &s;ituation of tho&s;e travellers, who take no heed to their &s;teps; or who, with a faith|ful guide at their right hand, and not knowing whither they are going, will nei|ther con&s;ult him, nor be admoni&s;hed by him: and thus, whil&s;t we would be con|&s;idered as the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t di&s;honour both Chri&s;t and our&s;elves; be perpetually wandering, and &s;tumbling, in &s;lippery places, and become an ea&s;y prey to
<PB N="67" REF="78">
the fir&s;t adver&s;ary that be&s;ets us. In other words, we mu&s;t always continue in a mo&s;t ignominious and wretched &s;tate; and when pluming our&s;elves upon our &s;uperiority to other men, be a ju&s;t object of ridicule to the Infidel, to the Jew, to the Mahome|dan, and even to the Pagan.</P>
<P>But, not only that we may appear ra|tional and con&s;i&s;tent beings, who would not be led blindfold, nor expo&s;ed to the re|proach of profe&s;&s;ing we know not what, I have adverted to many other particular rea|&s;ons, <HI>why</HI> we &s;hould &s;earch the &s;criptures, which I intend to illu&s;trate in the follow|ing pages.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us learn to main|tain &s;ome degree of con&s;i&s;tency in our cha|racter as profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians: and, as our labours to become ma&s;ters of the principles of any particular vocation, &s;hould be al|ways proportioned to the dignity and the &s;olid advantages belonging to it, let us con|&s;ider how earne&s;tly we &s;hould labour to be|come ma&s;ters of the principles of our Chri&s;tian vocation.</P>

To what a long cour&s;e of &s;ervitude do numbers voluntarily &s;ubject them&s;elves, to learn any of the common arts of life; by which, after they have learned them, they can only procure food and raiment?

<P>Again: ob&s;erve the merchant, how in|ce&s;&s;antly he toils to under&s;tand the nature and all the advantages of any particular branch of commerce. He mixes with every company who can furni&s;h him with any information. He &s;tudies all the turns of fortune that lie before him; all the dan|gers that are to be guarded again&s;t, and all the probable &s;chemes of adventuring with the greate&s;t certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. He turns the night into day in the pro&s;ecution of his object. He is ready, at all &s;ea&s;ons, to &s;ubmit to any fatigue, and to encounter all the extremes of the various contending elements. He pa&s;&s;es through all climates:

<P>Even the &s;oldier converts into a &s;cience, the different modes that may be pur&s;ued of &s;hedding blood.

<P>Many others give no &s;leep to their eyes, nor &s;lumber to their eye-lids, but work &s;even days in the week, to obtain a &s;mall portion of wealth or fame, which may not abide with them a day after they have ob|tained it; and which, after they have left this world, can no more advantage them for ever.</P>

<P>FROM the&s;e words, I propo&s;ed to &s;hew, <HI>why</HI> and <HI>how</HI> we &s;hould ob&s;erve the im|portant direction which they contain: and, I remarked, that there are many cogent arguments in &s;upport of the fir&s;t propo&s;i|tion, which may be compri&s;ed under the following particulars; namely, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'becau&s;e we profe&s;s the &s;criptures to be our rule of life; becau&s;e they contain the pure te&s;timonies concerning Chri&s;t, whom we acknowledge to be the mo&s;t endearing Me&s;&s;enger of the grace of God; becau&s;e they are, manife&s;tly, the will of God re|vealed to us; becau&s;e they contain the mo&s;t excellent and important knowledge;
<PB N="72" REF="83">
becau&s;e they are our be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t vice, and our &s;ure guide to per|fection; becau&s;e they are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation; and becau&s;e they are never weari&s;ome, nor di&s;gu&s;ting, to the &s;erious reader.'</Q></P>
<P>Having, in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uf|ficiently illu&s;trated the two fir&s;t particulars, I &s;hall, now, in the third place, lead your attention to our high obligation to &s;earch the &s;criptures, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'becau&s;e they are the will of the mo&s;t high God revealed to us.'</Q></P>
<P>If we only believe this, it will be a &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on to examine, whether we have formed a right judgment; or whether we have only followed the dictates of prejudice, or of a groundle&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, probably, embrace another op|portunity of illu&s;trating this point, and of &s;hewing, that we are not under the delu&s;ion of tho&s;e, who receive as <HI>divine,</HI> a <HI>cunningly devi&s;ed &s;able.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, ju&s;t ob&s;erve, at pre|&s;ent, that the purity and perfection of the doctrines which the &s;criptures contain,
<PB N="73" REF="84">
po&s;itively declare that they have proceeded from the Father of lights, from the only incorruptible fountain of truth, from the God of all wi&s;dom, and the only wi&s;e God.</P>
<P>Such doctrines, in &s;uch purity and per|fection, were never taught in the antient or modern &s;chools of philo&s;ophy; nor can they be collected from all the other books in the world be&s;ides, unle&s;s extracted from the&s;e: and yet, whereas other writers had every advantage of education, learning, and genius, the penmen of the&s;e were per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t occupation, were generally without any remarkable natural abilities, and ranked among&s;t the mo&s;t illiterate of mankind.</P>
<P>Whence then is it, that &s;hepherds and fi&s;hermen have been enabled to ri&s;e out of &s;ight, above an Ari&s;totle, a Plato, and a Socrates, in their teachings; and that the &s;criptures contain the only perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, that was ever publi&s;hed to the world? Whence, we may &s;ay, &s;uch &s;trength from &s;o much weakne&s;s: and, on the other
<PB N="74" REF="85">
hand, &s;uch weakne&s;s from &s;o much &s;trength? This is, evidently, in no other way to be ac|counted for, than by admitting the divine original of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the full accompli&s;hment of va|rious &s;ucceeding prophecies, relating to ex|traordinary events which no human eye could di&s;cover nor even imagine; the a&s;toni&s;hing miracles which attended the delivery of the law from the Mount; and the mighty power that accompanied Je&s;us during his mini&s;try, and his apo&s;tles after him, demon&s;trably prove, as the author of the Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews affirms, that it was <HI>God, who, at &s;undry times and in diver&s;e manners, &s;pake to the fathers in time pa&s;t by the prophets, and who hath &s;poken to us, in the la&s;t days, by his own Son.</HI></P>
<P>A&s;&s;uredly, then, if any object in the uni|ver&s;e can demand our utmo&s;t attention, it mu&s;t be the Almighty Sovereign of heaven and earth, in the adorable exerci&s;e of his mercy and grace, and in the marvellous conde&s;cen&s;ions of his love, manife&s;ted in

the communications of his will concern|ing us.</P>
<P>We are, continually, his dependent crea|tures and beneficiaries. All our pre&s;ent en|joyments are entirely owing to his good plea&s;ure; and, on his will alone, can any of all our hopes of future happine&s;s be found|ed. He doeth, according to his plea&s;ure, in all the armies of heaven, and among&s;t all the inhabitants of the earth. And no being whatever, who counteracteth his will, can &s;peak peace to his &s;oul; but mu&s;t be, every moment of his oppo&s;ition, po&s;ting to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But who can &s;o fully, &s;o clearly, and authoritatively reveal to us the will of God, as God him&s;elf?</P>
<P>All human attempts to explore it may be vain: all human explications of it may be fallible and delu&s;ive.</P>
<P>But God cannot deny, nor mi&s;repre&s;ent him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He can neither deceive, nor be deceived: nor can his infinite wi&s;dom admit of giving us any wrong information, or any in&s;truc|tions
<PB N="76" REF="87">
that do not powerfully lead to the &s;e|curity of our be&s;t intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>As, therefore, God hath &s;poken to us in the &s;criptures, the&s;e mu&s;t contain the mo&s;t clear and perfect will of God; and, con&s;equently, our path through life mu&s;t be mo&s;t effectually illuminated, and the rec|titude of our conduct be mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially &s;upported, by our knowledge of this will.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, therefore, &s;earch the &s;crip|tures, if we would either regard the favour of God, or make it a matter of concern to know what are the purpo&s;es of his wi&s;dom relating to us, and in what manner we &s;hould endeavour to plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>We &s;hould delight to &s;earch the &s;criptures, if we would thoroughly under&s;tand any thing of the goodne&s;s, mercy and truth of God; or be at all &s;olicitous to be informed for what ends he has de&s;igned us, what &s;ervices we owe him, and what duties we &s;hould cul|tivate and practi&s;e, to e&s;cape his di&s;plea&s;ure, and to obtain his loving kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>No other concerns whatever can be of &s;uch infinite importance to us; can &s;o de|&s;ervedly
<PB N="77" REF="88">
awaken our mo&s;t earne&s;t attention, or give &s;uch a &s;weetne&s;s and &s;pirit to all our labours. We mu&s;t &s;trangely neglect our own intere&s;ts, therefore, and forget our own dignity, when we would rather, in any re&s;pect, devote our&s;elves to the wi&s;dom of this world.</P>
<P>Nay, even to refu&s;e our &s;upreme reve|rence for the will of God, is a mark of blindne&s;s, as well as of impiety. The will of the great and honourable, the will of the learned and the mighty, and the will of the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant monarch who ever &s;wayed a &s;cepter, are all weakne&s;s and folly when compared with this; and are all, therefore, when preferred to this, marks of the greate&s;t &s;ervility, degeneracy, and meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the wi&s;dom of this world darkens and con&s;ounds us; involves us in number|le&s;s perplexing cares; and can pre&s;ent no object to our eager thought, that is not precarious, un&s;atisfying, and peri&s;hing.</P>
<P>But the wi&s;dom that de&s;cended from above, enlighteneth the eyes, giveth un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="78" REF="89">
to the &s;imple, e&s;tabli&s;heth peace in the heart, and endureth for ever; and is, therefore, the very wi&s;dom that becomes the creatures of this wi&s;dom, to &s;tudy, to admire, and meditate upon, with continu|ally encrea&s;ing plea&s;ure and affection.</P>
<P>But this leads me to con&s;ider, in the fourth place, that we are, likewi&s;e, under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to &s;earch the &s;crip|tures, becau&s;e they contain the mo&s;t ex|cellent, u&s;eful and &s;atisfying knowledge. This will clearly follow from the &s;uppo|&s;ition that they are the revealed will of God. For as He is the fountain of wi&s;|dom; the only fountain of all wi&s;dom; what he has taught us mu&s;t be infinitely more pure, and profitable, and delightful, than any other in&s;tructions we can po&s;&s;ibly re|ceive.</P>
<P>It &s;hould, al&s;o, be con&s;idered, that know|ledge is naturally as de&s;irable and refre&s;h|ing to the mind, as light is to the eyes, or food to the body.</P>
<P>We accordingly find, that the di&s;covery of every new truth, brings with it an un|&s;peakable
<PB N="79" REF="90">
additional plea&s;ure; and, above all other objects, charms, animates, and re|joices the heart.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e truths, e&s;pecially, which fully di&s;play the divine perfections, and repre|&s;ent the great God to us, not in a tyranni|cal and forbidding light, but as our adorable Friend and Father: tho&s;e truths, e&s;pecially, I &s;ay, mu&s;t be mo&s;t &s;weet and delightful to us, mu&s;t mo&s;t powerfully reconcile us to all the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, and chear and con&s;ole us in the mid&s;t of ad|ver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Again, tho&s;e truths which lead us to the mo&s;t intimate acquaintance with our&s;elves; which &s;hew us our own characters in the &s;tronge&s;t point of view; and which not only repre&s;ent to us every imperfection and de|fect in our tempers, inclinations, and pur|&s;uits, but which, likewi&s;e, unfold to us a method of deliverance from every thing that is burthen&s;ome, painful, and di&s;ho|nourable: tho&s;e truths, al&s;o, mu&s;t be of the mo&s;t &s;alutary, and of the noble&s;t kind.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="91">
The books, therefore, where tho&s;e truths are to be found, and are mo&s;t illu&s;|triou&s;ly di&s;played, mu&s;t contain the mo&s;t valuable, and illuminating knowledge.</P>
<P>But the holy &s;criptures; the holy &s;crip|tures only, are tho&s;e books.</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion is demon&s;trable from all tho&s;e arguments which prove, that they contain the revealed will of God.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily pure, and per|fect, &s;ince they have proceeded from the fountain of all wi&s;dom and knowledge. And what we would all wi&s;h, and hope, and expect, according to the obvious de|ductions of rea&s;on, happy experience will convince every man, who enters upon the trial, to be really the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>All other books whatever, unle&s;s they be &s;uch as are drawn up under the guidance of tho&s;e directions which are given us in the &s;criptures, are lame, defective, and con|fu&s;ed, in their &s;everal numberle&s;s attempts, to a&s;certain the character of the ever ble&s;&s;ed God.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="92">
But in the &s;criptures, He is mo&s;t clearly and invitingly repre&s;ented to us, in the adorable dre&s;s of love.</P>
<P>He is here de&s;cribed as the One, Only, Peerle&s;s Jehovah, the Supreme and Omni|potent Spirit, by who&s;e word the heavens and the earth were created; by who&s;e power and wi&s;dom the immen&s;e univer&s;e is conti|nually upheld and governed; who is pre|&s;ent with, and who&s;e tender mercies are always over all his works; and without who&s;e leave not &s;o much as a &s;parrow can fall to the ground.</P>
<P>Here, likewi&s;e, we receive the fulle&s;t in&s;ight into our own &s;ituation and charac|ters. Our weakne&s;&s;es and wants are all laid open. Our errors and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are all clearly detected. Our hearts are &s;earched through and through; and we are made to &s;ee and to feel, where our only &s;trength and &s;ecurity lie. We are taught that our trea&s;ures are not here; that poverty is not our greate&s;t misfortune, nor riches our greate&s;t bli&s;s. And, when we can feed our hopes upon none of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="82" REF="93">
this tran&s;itory &s;cene, we are taught to draw near to God, with a pure heart; to ca&s;t all our cares and burthens upon him; and are encouraged, if we love him and keep his commandments, to look forward to ever|la&s;ting peace and re&s;t under the &s;hadow of his wings.</P>
<P>It will appear, then, from the&s;e cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations, as I have already intimated, that &s;uch rational, &s;ublime, and reviving knowledge, is to be derived from no other &s;ource whatever.</P>
<P>All other &s;ources, to which we have ac|ce&s;s, are, in general, cloudy and un&s;atisfy|ing; and, in many ca&s;es, doubtful and per|plexed.</P>
<P>But this approves it&s;elf to be the bright luminary from heaven, which opens the eyes, and throws a full light into the mind. The P&s;almi&s;t, therefore, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have more under&s;tanding than all my teachers; for thy te&s;timonies, O Lord, are my me|ditation. I under&s;tand more than the antients; becau&s;e I keep thy precepts."</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How &s;weet are thy words
<PB N="83" REF="94">
unto my ta&s;te! Yea, &s;weeter than honey and the honey comb!"</Q></P>
<P>If we would, therefore, attain the mo&s;t excellent and important knowledge, the knowledge of the great God and of his providence; if we would behold the whole univer&s;e as one beautiful theatre, and all the various &s;cenes that are pa&s;&s;ing in it as wonderou&s;ly regulated to produce the great|e&s;t harmony and good, under his omnipre|&s;ent, and omni&s;cient eye; if we would ba|ni&s;h from us all the chaos of pagani&s;m, all the de&s;pondency of infidelity, all the gloom and horror of athei&s;tical melancholy, and ri&s;e to tho&s;e joys, which flow upon us, from di&s;covering the glorious perfections of God; from ob&s;erving that his throne is everla&s;ting, that his wi&s;dom, and power, and goodne&s;s, are boundle&s;s and unchange|able, that all his works &s;hew forth his prai&s;e; that he will rule for ever, and for ever be the refuge of all tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him: and if we would attain the mo&s;t exact knowledge of our&s;elves, of our great origin and di&s;tinction, and of tho&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="95">
things that mo&s;t intimately concern us, through all the revolutions of time: in &s;hort, if we would acquire that knowledge which principally ennobles and exalts the human mind; which will triumph over all tho&s;e monuments of genius that this world has ever produced; and which will be in|finitely important to us, through all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages of a boundle&s;s eternity; our readie&s;t, our only &s;ure way to this, is to &s;earch the &s;criptures, to &s;eize tho&s;e rich trea&s;ures which they contain, to drink free|ly of tho&s;e living waters with which they flow, and which they univer&s;ally diffu&s;e.</P>
<P>But this brings me to mention another argument to this purpo&s;e, which is indeed implied in what I have been ju&s;t urging, namely, as I was to ob&s;erve in the next place, that we &s;hould &s;earch the &s;criptures, becau&s;e they are our be&s;t pre&s;ervatives again&s;t vice; again&s;t that which is peculiarly de|grading and ruinous to us; which is ever at variance with all our intere&s;ts, and is at|tended with pain and &s;hame, and all the
<PB N="85" REF="96">
horrors of the mo&s;t excruciating puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, &s;urely, decline no labours, however arduous, to guard our&s;elves again&s;t &s;o great an evil, and to become completely triumphant over it.</P>
<P>But no other writings whatever, be&s;ides tho&s;e we are now con&s;idering, mark out, in the cleare&s;t lines, the exact boundaries between vice and virtue; or fla&s;h &s;uch con|viction upon the mind, concerning the ten|dency, as well as the different natures of the one and of the other.</P>
<P>Other writings, indeed, repre&s;ent many vices as virtues, which at once appear, in the &s;criptures, without the help of argu|ments, to be real vices.</P>
<P>And though many other writings mo&s;t eloquently declaim again&s;t vice in general, yet they too commonly leave it, in all its particulars, in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our af|fections.</P>
<P>They do not come with that authority which always commands attention: nor do they &s;peak with that force to the heart,
<PB N="86" REF="97">
which opens our eyes to the things that be|long to our peace.</P>
<P>They have a &s;tudied acutene&s;s without energy; elaborate rea&s;onings without evi|dence; and an abundance of per&s;ua&s;ive en|treaties without &s;ufficiently awakening mo|tives.</P>
<P>But the &s;criptures, with the utmo&s;t of nature's &s;implicity, and yet with an autho|rity decidedly de&s;cending from heaven, pluck up vice by the roots; expo&s;e it in that form of wretchedne&s;s and infamy, which cannot be beheld without horrour and aver&s;ion; and, like a two-edged &s;word, cut it down on every &s;ide, and de&s;troy all its influence over us. They repre&s;ent it, as it is in fact, univer&s;ally accompanied with di&s;grace and mi&s;ery: they detect it in all its haunts, and in all its different dre&s;&s;es, and &s;hew us the concealed poi&s;on, which it always carries with it, under its mo&s;t plea|&s;urable and alluring forms.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t, therefore, we maintain an inti|macy with the &s;criptures, we can no more be drawn into the commi&s;&s;ion of vice, than
<PB N="87" REF="98">
we can knowingly indulge and cheri&s;h our deadly and implacable enemy. And this argument alone might be thought &s;uffici|ently weighty to influence us to follow the direction in the text, and to embrace tho&s;e golden opportunities, with which we are graciou&s;ly furni&s;hed, for overcoming the world, and e&s;caping the mo&s;t tremendous of all evils.</P>
<P>But this will be farther evident, when we con&s;ider the great efficacy of the &s;crip|tures to lead us to perfection and &s;alvation; which, with &s;ome other arguments in &s;up|port of the doctrine of the text, I propo&s;e to illu&s;trate in the following di&s;cour&s;e: after which, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, particu|tarly, <HI>how</HI> we &s;hould always apply our&s;elves to &s;earch the &s;criptures to the be&s;t ad|vantage.</P>
<P>In the mean time let us learn, from what has been &s;aid, both the importance of the &s;criptures, and the importance of our be&s;towing all due attention upon them. And, if there be tho&s;e around us who manife&s;t de&s;igns to debar us of the u&s;e of
<PB N="88" REF="99">
the &s;criptures, or to impre&s;s us with a di&s;|like or aver&s;ion to them, let us con&s;ider &s;uch de&s;igns as levelled again&s;t our be&s;t in|tere&s;ts; and let us be per&s;uaded, that all tho&s;e who endeavour to practi&s;e &s;uch de|&s;igns again&s;t us, are our mo&s;t pernicious enemies, who would tyrannize over us, and rob us of our riche&s;t inheritance. Let us be fully per&s;uaded, that they would keep us in &s;lavery and darkne&s;s; make us fools and hypocrites; bereave us of all the privi|leges of rational beings; leave us a prey to every iniquity; and bani&s;h the highe&s;t con|&s;olation and joy from our hearts.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, not &s;uffer our&s;elves, by our own indolence, to &s;ink into that wretched and ignominious &s;tate, into which the very <HI>fooli&s;h,</HI> or the very <HI>wicked,</HI> the <HI>empty &s;corner,</HI> or the proud, covetous, and am|bitious, would villainou&s;ly en&s;lave us.</P>
<P>But let us open our under&s;tandings to the things that are true.</P>
<P>Let us rejoice in that wi&s;dom which de|&s;cended from above.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="100">
Let us walk worthy of the high privi|leges with which we are favoured, and the heavenly vocations with which we are called.</P>
<P>Let wi&s;dom influence us; let integrity guide us: and let us act as tho&s;e &s;ervants, who have not here any abiding city, and who would be always ready to receive the approbation of their Lord at his coming; and to enter upon tho&s;e joys, which, from the foundation of the world, are prepared for all the faithful children of God.</P>

<P>I Propo&s;ed, from the&s;e words, to enforce, in the fir&s;t place, our obligations to at|tend to the precept which they contain; and to &s;hew, in the next place, <HI>how,</HI> or in what manner, we &s;hall mo&s;t fully te&s;tify our cordial, and entire compliance with it.</P>
<P>I have, already, argued that we ought to &s;earch the &s;criptures, becau&s;e we pro|fe&s;s them to be our rule of life; becau&s;e they contain the pure te&s;timonies concern|ing Chri&s;t, whom we acknowledge to be our divinely appointed Lord and Ma&s;ter; becau&s;e they are, manife&s;tly, the will of the mo&s;t high God revealed to us; becau&s;e they contain the mo&s;t &s;atisfying and u&s;eful

knowledge; and becau&s;e they are our be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t vice and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I now proceed to &s;hew, that we are un|der the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to &s;earch the &s;criptures, becau&s;e they are our &s;ure guide to perfection; becau&s;e they are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation; and becau&s;e they are never weari&s;ome, nor di&s;gu&s;ting to the &s;erious reader.</P>
<P>All the&s;e arguments together, I &s;hould think, mu&s;t work a conviction in every rational mind; and rou&s;e us to be active and vigilant, faithful and per&s;evering, in our endeavours to under&s;tand the records of divine truth.</P>
<P>But, having endeavoured, in the two preceding di&s;cour&s;es, to illu&s;trate briefly the five fir&s;t arguments, I &s;hall now con&s;ider, in the &s;ixth place, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the great and unpa|ralleled excellency of the &s;criptures to e&s;tabli&s;h us in every excellency and per|fection;'</Q> and &s;hall hence ob&s;erve our in|di&s;pen&s;able obligations to be fully acquainted with them.</P>

To this purpo&s;e, you may perceive that, whil&s;t the authors of other writings fre|quently give us fine le&s;&s;ons of virtue, they too commonly, notwith&s;tanding, treat it as a mere chimerical object, beyond the reach of humanity: and whil&s;t they pretend to admire and love it, and to rai&s;e in us an unabating ambition to attain it, they but too pathetically, at the &s;ame time, declare, as Paul repre&s;ents a man in his degenerate &s;tate, that though <HI>to will is pre&s;ent with them, yet how to perform that which is good they know not</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An illu&s;trious heathen poet has &s;aid to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <HI>Video meliora, proboque, deteriora &s;equor.</HI> The &s;ame poet fre|quently di&s;covered his ignorance of the <HI>meliora,</HI> and unblu&s;h|ingly repre&s;ented him&s;elf as addicted to practices, which cannot be decently mentioned.

This &s;hould be particularly con&s;idered by tho&s;e per&s;ons, who now continue to quote the poet, in &s;upport of their total di&s;regard to all moral obligations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the &s;criptures give us examples of all the&s;e fine le&s;&s;ons carried into practice,
<PB N="94" REF="104">
and even furni&s;h examples which greatly eclip&s;e them all.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the le&s;&s;ons of virtue that are re|corded for our in&s;truction in the &s;criptures, are greatly &s;uperior to all tho&s;e that we meet in any other writings. Let us only con&s;ider our Lord's &s;ermon upon the mount as a full proof of this.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek: ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit: ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s: ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart: ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful: ble&s;&s;ed are the peace|makers: ble&s;&s;ed are the per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake: re&s;i&s;t not evil: him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away: love your enemies: ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per&s;ecute you.'</Q></P>
<P>Again, when we hear our Lord warning us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Judge not that ye be not judged:'</Q> or, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'be ye not as the hypocrites are, who only would be &s;een of men: or when'</Q> we hear him in&s;tructing us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is not every one who &s;aith, Lord, Lord! who &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven:'</Q>

<P>Again, if we only examine the hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph, what is there, in all heathen antiquity, that can be mentioned, which is &s;o well calculated to keep us in a con&s;tant &s;ubjection to all the laws of God, through all the unexpected, and a&s;toni&s;hingly vari|egated &s;cenes of life?</P>
<P>Again, to &s;upport us under the mo&s;t accumulated di&s;tre&s;s, what is there that can equal, or bear any kind of compari&s;on with our Lord's con&s;olatory di&s;cour&s;e to the di&s;ciples, a little before his &s;ufferings? Or, to rou&s;e the &s;upine and unreflecting &s;inner from his wretched and ignominious &s;tate, what is there, in all the other books
<PB N="96" REF="106">
in the world, &s;o pathetically powerful, as the parable of the prodigal &s;on?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, whil&s;t other writings only im|perfectly de&s;cribe to us what the authors would wi&s;h men to be, we have, in the &s;criptures, clouds of witne&s;&s;es, who even exceeded the wi&s;hes of &s;uch authors; <HI>who walked before God in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s;</HI> and who, triumphing over the world, and holding fa&s;t their integrity to the end, <HI>all died in the faith.</HI></P>
<P>And we have, here, one particular glo|rious example, who was without &s;pot or blemi&s;h, and who was always doing the will of his and our Father, who is in heaven.</P>
<P>Thus is vice dethroned from its highe&s;t &s;eat, and virtue recommended to us, with an eloquence not to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>

<P>Indeed, the in&s;tructions and example of the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, and of many other good men recorded in the &s;acred writings, have a mighty force to rai&s;e us above the world, and its lu&s;ts, and to exalt us to that perfection and holine&s;s, which are nece&s;&s;ary to our acceptance with God.</P>
<P>But, above all, whil&s;t we look unto Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of our faith, who, for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame thereof, our hearts, in all circum&s;tances,
<PB N="99" REF="109">
mu&s;t be fixed in the practice of what is good; we mu&s;t be &s;tedfa&s;t, immoveable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord.</P>
<P>If we would, therefore, conquer our wor&s;t enemy, &s;in; and, by keeping a con&s;ci|ence void of offence, have always confi|dence towards God, as the Father of mer|cies, and our &s;ure refuge and tower of de|fence, we mu&s;t &s;earch the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>The&s;e chain down the mon&s;ter &s;in under our feet; and lead to the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every virtue which can adorn the heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;upremely aggrandize our rational natures; and in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, through evil report or good report, in life or in death, infu&s;e the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial joys into the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Our Lord, therefore, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world;'</Q> &s;igni|fying, that we, al&s;o, may overcome. Again, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls.'</Q> Again, we are to con&s;ider, on the one hand, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the wicked &s;hall go away into ever|la&s;ting

<P>Now this is the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive of all arguments, both to redeem us from &s;in, and to e&s;tabli&s;h us in all righteou&s;ne&s;s, and goodne&s;s, and truth: or,</P>
<P>As I was to ob&s;erve, in the next place, we &s;hould be e&s;pecially per&s;uaded to &s;earch the &s;criptures, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'becau&s;e they are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation;'</Q> that is, as the apo&s;tle means, they are fully &s;ufficient to this purpo&s;e. For, here, we have the true way to eternal life, written in &s;uch plain characters, that he that runs may read it. And, here, we have the great God re|pre&s;ented as ready to be reconciled to us, as offering us pardon and acceptance, whil&s;t we are yet afar off, and as willing and de|&s;iring that all may be &s;aved.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="111">
Here, again, we are not only taught and enabled, how to live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, but we are, likewi&s;e, guarded again&s;t all iniquity, by ob&s;erving, that her &s;teps take hold on hell: and we are confirmed, &s;up|ported, and held fa&s;t, in a cour&s;e of holi|ne&s;s, by learning that the reward of holi|ne&s;s will be an eternal inheritance in the heavens. And,</P>
<P>Here, we have all tho&s;e divine promi&s;es, after which our &s;ouls naturally hope, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of failing.</P>
<P>We are taught to rely on the faithfulne&s;s of the immutable God. And Je&s;us, the mediator of the new covenant, and our &s;orerunner into the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed, hath, through his own re&s;urrection, which was effected by the manife&s;t omnipotent operation of God, brought life and immor|tality to light; and demon&s;trably a&s;&s;ured us, that, becau&s;e he liveth, we &s;hall live al&s;o; and that, where he is gone, we &s;hall likewi&s;e go, if we follow his &s;teps.</P>
<P>We have, here, in &s;hort, every motive, direction, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and encouragement,
<PB N="102" REF="112">
to make us pure and holy in all manner of conver&s;ation; and every a&s;&s;urance we could wi&s;h, that we &s;hall not labour in vain in the Lord. Here we &s;ee &s;in dive&s;ted of its power; and hell and death led captives be|fore our eyes; and the heavens opened for our reception; and glory, and honour, and immortality, de&s;cending upon us. And, as we continue the &s;earch, we proportionably encrea&s;e in &s;trength; we mount up with wings as eagles; we look down upon the world as a tran&s;ient toy; and, from the glory that &s;hall hereafter be revealed, we are prepared for all events, and even willing to depart, and be with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Surely, then, all the&s;e things put toge|ther, are &s;ufficient to rai&s;e our affections to the be&s;t goods; and to &s;upport us, through all the various &s;truggles which can await us, in running the race that is before us.</P>
<P>If we would, therefore, di&s;cover any re|gard to our immortal intere&s;ts; if we would, moreover, infallibly &s;ecure the&s;e intere&s;ts; if we would ever love, and be beloved by our heavenly Father; or, if we would pro|cure
<PB N="103" REF="113">
peace and re&s;t, and &s;alvation to our precious &s;ouls, we mu&s;t &s;earch the &s;crip|tures.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a tree of life to all who rightly u&s;e and improve them; or a fountain of living water, which de&s;cended from heaven, of which he who drinketh &s;hall never thir&s;t. The&s;e, therefore, &s;hould be e&s;timated above gold, above much fine gold; and &s;hould be always a lamp to our feet, and a light to our path.</P>
<P>But it may be once more ob&s;erved, as I propo&s;ed to &s;hew in the la&s;t place, that the &s;criptures are never weari&s;ome nor di&s;gu&s;t|ing to the &s;erious reader.</P>
<P>This is known to all tho&s;e who be&s;tow any kind of attention upon them, and be&s;t known to tho&s;e who &s;tudy them the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is known, at the &s;ame time, that we become tired of mo&s;t other writings, after we have read them once or twice over.</P>
<P>But we may return to the &s;criptures again and again a thou&s;and times, with en|crea&s;ing plea&s;ure, and &s;till meet with &s;ome object to delight and charm us. Let any
<PB N="104" REF="114">
one try, for example &s;ake, the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th chapters of John's go&s;pel; or our Lord's parables, and other di&s;cour&s;es; or the apo&s;tle Paul's de&s;cription of charity; or many of the p&s;alms; not to mention an abundance of other particular &s;elect pa&s;|&s;ages, and he will find that the oftener he reads them the better he is plea&s;ed, and the more he is inclined to read them again.</P>
<P>But let any one make the &s;ame trial of any other writings in the world, and he will find the con&s;equence to be totally dif|ferent.</P>
<P>Other writings, indeed, are generally &s;o laboured, formal, and &s;y&s;tematical, that we &s;oon lo&s;e all reli&s;h for the re-peru&s;al of them: but, in the &s;criptures, the attention is always engaged by native &s;implicity and beauty; and, in&s;tead of being obliged to turn over &s;ome hundreds of pages to come at the di&s;covery of &s;ome truth, we have the mo&s;t refre&s;hing truths in almo&s;t every page; and can never travel far without meeting with that jewel of great price, which fully &s;atisfies the &s;oul, and &s;wallows
<PB N="105" REF="115">
up all the affections in the contemplation of it.</P>
<P>And whereas other writings can fre|quently afford no con&s;olation to the dejected mind, the&s;e are a &s;overeign remedy for every complaint. They pour &s;uch a flood of light into the &s;oul, concerning the love and grace of God, that there can remain nothing to make us greatly unea&s;y, unle&s;s we labour under the burthen of &s;in: nor can there be any thing in the world to alarm us, if we be followers of God as dear children. For he will never leave nor for&s;ake his children, but will give them light in darkne&s;s, and be pre&s;ent with them, and comfort them at all times.</P>
<P>Therefore, to learn to be &s;uch; to know that we are &s;uch; and to be con&s;tantly ex|erci&s;ing the mind, in receiving the glorious privileges of all &s;uch, mu&s;t be our mo&s;t delightful &s;tudy.</P>
<P>And, therefore, if we would read, and not be weary; if we would read, and re|joice at the &s;ame time; if we would always read to obtain plea&s;ure, and to &s;trengthen
<PB N="106" REF="116">
and enliven the heart; and if, whil&s;t we read, we would ri&s;e above all the cro&s;&s;es and vexations of the world, we mu&s;t re|peatedly apply our&s;elves to &s;earch the holy &s;criptures. The p&s;almi&s;t, therefore, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'O how I love thy law; it is my medita|tion all the day!'</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Thou art my hiding place and my &s;hield; I hope in thy word!'</Q></P>
<P>Your own reflections may furni&s;h you with many additional ob&s;ervations in &s;up|port of all tho&s;e arguments which I have endeavoured to lay before you.</P>
<P>However, from what has been already &s;aid, I think my&s;elf fully ju&s;tified to con|clude, that we are under the mo&s;t forcible and important obligations, to apply our|&s;elves to a frequent examination of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, maintain the cha|racter of rational beings, whil&s;t we profe&s;s them to be our rule of life; and would, con&s;equently, be &s;upo&s;ed intimately ac|quainted with them.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="117">
We cannot, otherwi&s;e, indeed, with any con&s;i&s;tency, call our&s;elves the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; by which it is, at lea&s;t, implied, that we have &s;tudied his doctrines, and that we look up to them as the &s;tandard of our conduct.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, &s;ufficiently reve|rence the wi&s;dom of God, nor give unto him the glory that is due to his holy name: for, as he, above all beings, demands our highe&s;t prai&s;es, his will, above all other con&s;iderations, requires our &s;upreme atten|tion, our mo&s;t cheerful acquie&s;cence, and our devoute&s;t heartfelt acknowledgments.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, di&s;cover any real concern to &s;tore our minds with the mo&s;t &s;atisfying and purifying knowledge.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, adopt the mo&s;t direct means of emancipating our&s;elves from the &s;ervitude of &s;in, and of becoming per|fect in our mea&s;ure and degree, as our hea|venly Father is perfect.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, make the be&s;t preparations for eternity, nor worthily re|gard the goodne&s;s, forbearance, and long-&s;uffering
<PB N="108" REF="118">
of God, which would lead us to repentance and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Nor can we, otherwi&s;e, make choice of the mo&s;t rational and daily improving plea|&s;ures; plea&s;ures which are never weari&s;ome nor di&s;gu&s;ting, but continually more and more refre&s;hing, &s;trengthening, and delight|ful to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Upon tho&s;e objects, therefore, which lay us under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations, our at|tention &s;hould be mo&s;t inten&s;ely fixed.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hould take full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, and exclude every thing inferior, when put in competition with them.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not prefer trifling toys to in|e&s;timable jewels: nor omit, nor neglect, doing any thing e&s;&s;ential to our &s;afety and happine&s;s, to indulge in indolence, to e&s;cape the ridicule of fools, or to avoid any temporary inconveniences.</P>
<P>We &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly and indefatigably en|deavour to &s;ecure our highe&s;t intere&s;ts; to e&s;tabli&s;h the be&s;t principles; to lay up trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom; and to be always ad|vancing to perfection, in oppo&s;ition to all
<PB N="109" REF="119">
the cares, vexations, and di&s;quietudes, of a tumultuous world.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be ever, therefore, infinitely grateful to our almighty Creator and Bene|factor, for &s;o un&s;peakable a ble&s;&s;ing as the holy &s;criptures; for his great goodne&s;s in putting &s;o invaluable a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion into our hands, which, whil&s;t it peculiarly enriches and ennobles the mind, fills it with the mo&s;t glorious hopes, communicates to us the highe&s;t comforts, and rai&s;eth us to an immortal and unfading crown of glory.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould be thankful for that which is lea&s;t, how &s;upremely thankful &s;hould we be for that which is greate&s;t? Or, if we &s;hould be thankful for tho&s;e wonderful in|&s;tincts, which lead us to watch over the concerns of this pre&s;ent life; if we &s;hould be thankful for all tho&s;e capacities which rai&s;e us above the other creatures of this world, and for all the pa&s;&s;ing enjoyments of every pa&s;&s;ing moment, how infinitely more thankful &s;hould we be for &s;o un&s;peak|able a gift, for &s;o ennobling a trea&s;ure, as

<P>We &s;hould ble&s;s the God of all wi&s;dom and knowledge, the Father of mercies, the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for &s;o precious a gift, and ine&s;timable pledge of his love to men.</P>
<P>And, whil&s;t we reflect that he has ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in the go&s;pel of his grace, we &s;hould not be unmindful of any of his benefits.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not abu&s;e the indulgence of his forbearance and long-&s;uffering, by a &s;hameful contempt, or refu&s;al of it.</P>
<P>We &s;hould love him with all the heart; delight to do his will; and be all obedience to his voice.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, therefore, repeatedly and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, what an&s;wer &s;hall we be able to make at the great day of accounts, if we reject his coun&s;el, and ca&s;t his re|proof behind us?

<P>HAVING already con&s;idered the rea&s;ons or arguments <HI>why</HI> we &s;hould pay all due attention to this important and gracious exhortation, it now remains that I endea|vour to &s;hew, as was propo&s;ed in the &s;e|cond place, <HI>how,</HI> or <HI>in what manner,</HI> we &s;hall &s;earch the &s;criptures to the be&s;t pur|po&s;e, and &s;o that we may continually profit by the repetition of our enquiries.</P>
<P>The direction, like many others, may be complied with in a certain &s;en&s;e, without an&s;wering the de&s;ign of our Lord; as we may &s;et apart a particular portion of time to any other &s;elect exerci&s;e or employment, and yet, for want of a proper attention to
<PB N="114" REF="123">
the bu&s;ine&s;s in which we are engaged, be all the while labouring in vain.</P>
<P>We may, for in&s;tance, read the &s;crip|tures as a ta&s;k, and even &s;ubmit to the re|&s;olution of not allowing a day to pa&s;s, in which we do not read a determinate num|ber of chapters; and yet, if in all this la|bour we have no other view than the ac|qui&s;ition of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed imaginary merit, for having merely applied our&s;elves to &s;uch a ta&s;k, we &s;hall con&s;tantly fini&s;h ju&s;t where we fir&s;t began, with &s;carcely ad|vancing a &s;ingle &s;tep in the way of know|ledge, though we have habituated our&s;elves a number of years to this practice. Our Lord, therefore, does not &s;ay <HI>read,</HI> but <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures.</HI></P>
<P>He never laid a &s;tre&s;s upon external &s;er|vices, any farther than the&s;e were &s;o at|tended as to become happily in&s;trumental in enlightening the under&s;tanding, and im|proving the heart.</P>
<P>As he knew that we might hear, and ca&s;t reproof behind us; and that we might call him Lord, and not obey the will of

He has, therefore, guarded us again&s;t the abu&s;e, or mi&s;application, of his direction in the text, as he has, at other times, guarded us again&s;t the abu&s;e, or mi&s;application of his other in&s;tructions, by requiring us not to <HI>repeat,</HI> or <HI>turn over,</HI> but to <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures.</HI> And this im|plies, that we examine them with the ut|mo&s;t attention and care; and that we ac|quire, as much as po&s;&s;ible, a general view of the doctrines of the whole, as well as con&s;ider the force and meaning of each &s;elect pa&s;&s;age con&s;idered in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We may read them over an hundred times, and not &s;earch them; as we may pa&s;s through a garden an hundred times, with|out taking any particular account of the productions it contains; or pa&s;s through a cabinet of curio&s;ities an hundred times, without knowing, or rightly con&s;idering, the nature, value, or beauty of any of tho&s;e articles of which it is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="125">
We may even, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, get the &s;criptures by heart, and not &s;earch them; as we may a particular number of names, without attending to the meaning of any one of them &s;ingly.</P>
<P>To <HI>&s;earch,</HI> the attention mu&s;t be awake: &s;ome degree of labour and &s;tudy is required: we mu&s;t take a full view of every object that comes in our way, and con&s;ider the purpo&s;es for which it is pre&s;ented to us; or, in other words, we mu&s;t carefully exa|mine all that the &s;criptures teach us to be|lieve, and likewi&s;e all the &s;everal duties which they teach us to practice, and par|ticularly apply the&s;e to our&s;elves, as much as we re&s;pect them in their general relation to all the children of men.</P>
<P>And, to this purpo&s;e, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'we mu&s;t &s;earch them without prejudice: we mu&s;t &s;earch them as they &s;tand connected together: we mu&s;t &s;earch them without being un|der the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions: we mu&s;t &s;earch them not as a matter of curio&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of mere &s;cience: we mu&s;t &s;earch them, not as calculated for parti|cular

<P>In the fir&s;t place, if we wi&s;h to examine the &s;criptures to any valuable purpo&s;e, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all prejudice, or pre-con|ceived opinions concerning them.'</Q></P>
<P>Unle&s;s we do this, we &s;hall always force them to &s;peak our own &s;entiments, and &s;hall never become much wi&s;er from our acquaintance with them. We &s;hall, in this ca&s;e, put light for darkne&s;s, and darkne&s;s for light; call evil good, and good evil; and &s;hall always fancy that we find in them whatever favourite opinions we before flat|tered our&s;elves they mu&s;t contain.</P>
<P>A Roman Catholic, under this bias, will di&s;cover in them his purgatory and tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation; and even a Pagan will di&s;cover in them his pagani&s;m. The one will &s;ay, Did not Je&s;us preach to the &s;pirits in pri|&s;on, and call the bread which he brake his body? And the other will &s;ay, Is there not mention made of the Gods of the hills and of the vallies? A mere &s;hadow will be

mi&s;taken by &s;uch a one for a reality, and his imagination will be &s;o fixed upon this, as to annihilate the mo&s;t po&s;itive demon|&s;trations to the contrary. For, to read the &s;criptures with prejudice, implies that we judge or determine before hand, what doc|trines they contain, and that we read them only to produce in our&s;elves &s;ome &s;hew of argument in confirmation of the&s;e doc|trines.</P>
<P>To &s;earch the &s;criptures with prejudice, then, is, in fact, a contradiction. For, by &s;earching them at all it is implied, that we &s;eriou&s;ly enquire what they, of them&s;elves, clearly require us to believe and practi&s;e, independently of what all others may have repre&s;ented them to require, and indepen|dently of any previous notions which we our&s;elves may have formed concerning them.</P>
<P>In other words, we &s;hould &s;it down to the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, as to the &s;tudy of a book containing a revelation from God addre&s;&s;ed to all his rational offspring in this world; and all the doctrines of which have
<PB N="119" REF="128">
a certain determinate meaning, without any retro&s;pect to the plea&s;ure of any creature.</P>
<P>And, fully to under&s;tand all tho&s;e truths which they propo&s;e to us, as the&s;e are in them&s;elves, we &s;hould labour as much as po&s;&s;ible to forget all other knowledge, and to keep out of &s;ight every particular explica|tion that has been given of them by others: we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that there are no &s;uch creeds, or e&s;tabli&s;hed articles of faith in the world, as have been pretended to be de|duced from them; and we &s;hould take them up as a new book which had never been opened, but which, we know, con|tains the will of God; and we &s;hould, then, endeavour to di&s;cover, according to their own plain and obviou&s;ly con&s;i&s;tent language, what &s;entiments and practices they univer|&s;ally inculcate, what pro&s;pects they open to our attentive view, and upon what terms they a&s;&s;ure us of the everla&s;ting favour and friend&s;hip of God. It is in this manner only, that we can ever ju&s;tly hope to at|tain any tolerable knowledge of the &s;crip|tures.</P>

<P>Hence it is, that we have &s;o many &s;ects and parties among&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Numbers having been &s;everally taught particular &s;y&s;tems, and having even been taught that their &s;alvation is concerned in receiving the &s;criptures as containing tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, have recour&s;e to the &s;criptures, not to learn what the&s;e teach, but &s;olely to tor|ture them into a confirmation of their own &s;entiments. And thus they continue di|viding and wrangling about the Shibboleth of a party, and deviate all po&s;&s;ible ways from the truth, in&s;tead of harmoniou&s;ly uniting in a&s;&s;erting their Chri&s;tian liberty; in promoting piety and mutual forbearance; and in cultivating the univer&s;al love of God and man.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="130">
It is owing to prejudice, al&s;o, that the &s;ceptic is frequently confirmed in his infi|delity, even by reading the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e he &s;its down to read them, not to make a fair trial, whether they be the will of God or not, but to collect arguments to convince him that they are not; the evidence of truth, therefore, leaves no im|pre&s;&s;ion upon his mind.</P>
<P>He pays no attention to the &s;ublimity of the language; the energy of the &s;entiments; the purity, rea&s;onablene&s;s, and perfection of the doctrines; or the demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit with power by which they are confirmed: for all the&s;e things are con|trary to the point at which he aims.</P>
<P>He fixes upon &s;ome figurative pa&s;&s;age, and in&s;i&s;ts that it &s;hould be literally under|&s;tood; and, therefore, repre&s;ents it as ab|&s;urd, and, con&s;equently, as de&s;titute of any foundation in truth. And thus he vainly triumphs in his own weakne&s;s, whil&s;t he dogmatically rejects, without the &s;hadow of argument, what he would allow to be
<PB N="122" REF="131">
fair and rational in any other writings be|&s;ides the&s;e.</P>
<P>Or if he do not de&s;cend &s;o low as to carp at different repre&s;entations of indiffe|rent things, or to controvert facts by &s;tart|ing difficulties about circum&s;tantials, or to &s;ub&s;titute, in the room of &s;acred truth, &s;ome mi&s;tran&s;lations, or mutilated pa&s;&s;ages, or accidental additions of tran&s;cribers to the text; he will, however, fix upon &s;ome par|ticular hi&s;torical pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame tran&s;|action, and becau&s;e one hi&s;torian only men|tions the principal per&s;ons concerned in this tran&s;action, and another mentions be|&s;ides the&s;e all the per&s;ons pre&s;ent; it will be pretended, therefore, that contradictions are di&s;covered, and that no credit is due to either of the hi&s;torians. And hence occa|&s;ion is taken to di&s;pute, and explode tho&s;e facts, which are related to us in the &s;ame words, and with exactly all the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But, whil&s;t the &s;acred writings receive this treatment from him, the &s;ame &s;ceptic will admit, every day, &s;imilar accounts of
<PB N="123" REF="132">
things, from different authors of intelli|gence, without granting, or even dream|ing, that the charge of fal&s;hood &s;hould be fixed upon either.</P>
<P>If he &s;hould read, for in&s;tance, in one Greek hi&s;torian, that Homer wrote the Iliad, and, in another, that Homer wrote the Ody&s;&s;ey; or, &s;hould he read in one hi&s;torian, that Alexander entered A&s;ia, at a particular time, but, in another, that Alexander at the head of a great army en|tered A&s;ia at that time, he could ea&s;ily re|concile all the&s;e relations, and could not but admit that all the writers &s;pake truth. Or, if he read in one Roman hi&s;torian, that Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius con&s;pired again&s;t Julius Cae&s;ar, but, in another, that Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius, and above &s;ixty &s;enators, con&s;pired again&s;t Cae&s;ar, and killed him in the &s;enate|hou&s;e at Rome; he would readily allow that the fir&s;t hi&s;torian confined his attention to the principal con&s;pirators, whil&s;t the other, without meaning any contradiction, intro|duced the whole party concerned; and he
<PB N="124" REF="133">
would not think of imputing to either of them the lea&s;t fal&s;hood or incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>But that which the &s;ceptic will admit to be right and ju&s;tifiable, in all other writ|ings, and upon all other occa&s;ions, he will deride and carp at in the &s;criptures. And the rea&s;on, we &s;ee, is, as appears from the in&s;tances now produced, not becau&s;e the &s;criptures are liable to the objections he urges again&s;t them, but becau&s;e he is under the power of prejudice, which di&s;po&s;es him to find fault, and leads him to find difficul|ties in the plaine&s;t truths; to invert the order of things; to involve in darkne&s;s the obvious dictates of common &s;en&s;e; and to prevent the glory of God, by the appear|ance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from &s;hining into our hearts.</P>
<P>But, again, as already hinted, it is ow|ing to prejudice that Chri&s;tians hold &s;uch contradictory &s;entiments, concerning the peculiar doctrines of the &s;criptures; that the mo&s;t palpably jarring and diametrically op|po&s;ite &s;y&s;tems, have been, at different times, not only by particular churches, but by
<PB N="125" REF="134">
particular individuals of the &s;ame church, pretended to be deduced from them; and that what one party has confidently pre|&s;umed to prove, another party has as con|fidently pre&s;umed to confute from the &s;ame &s;criptures.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures them&s;elves, when fairly examined, will not be found to contain contradictory doctrines. But it is impo&s;&s;i|ble &s;o to expre&s;s any thing in any particu|lar language, as to put it out of the power of prejudice, to pervert and mi&s;under&s;tand it. And what we are willing to find, and po&s;itive that we can find, we &s;hall ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded we have found, when we meet with any thing, which, in &s;ound, or at a di&s;tance, looks at all like it.</P>
<P>When, therefore, one party &s;uppo&s;es, be|fore hand, that &s;uch particular doctrines mu&s;t be true, and another party &s;uppo&s;es that the quite contrary doctrines mu&s;t be true; and both apply to the &s;criptures, not &s;o much to examine what they declare, as &s;everally to confirm their own peculiar no|tions; it is no wonder that tho&s;e of each
<PB N="126" REF="135">
party fancy they have di&s;covered &s;omething, from which, they think, they may con|clude, what they determined to conclude at fir&s;t, namely, that the &s;criptures were on their &s;ide of the argument: for, with &s;uch per&s;ons, &s;uppo&s;itions will pa&s;s for proofs, and the mo&s;t po&s;itive evidence in favour of any doctrine will be received as a proof of the contrary. In &s;hort, the crooked will be &s;traight, and the &s;traight will be crooked; a parable will be read as a hi&s;tory, and a hi&s;tory as a parable; the plaine&s;t precept will be under&s;tood ironically, and the mo&s;t figurative language explained literally.</P>
<P>To &s;earch the &s;criptures, then, to any purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e nothing before|hand, but apply to them for information, to be led to the knowledge and practice of every duty. Or, as the apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As new-born babes, we &s;hould de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that we may grow thereby."</Q></P>
<P>New-born babes have no prejudices, but are ready to receive knowledge, ju&s;t as it is propo&s;ed to them, without being thwarted
<PB N="127" REF="136">
or baffled in their enquiries, by any pre-conceived opinions. And exactly with the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions, &s;hould we endeavour to come to the &s;criptures, to derive any pro|fitable or advantageous in&s;truction from our peru&s;al of them.</P>
<P>All other knowledge, which concerns us as pilgrims and &s;ojourners here, unle&s;s it be tran&s;cribed from the&s;e, we &s;hould con|&s;ider as depending on conjectures, or found|ed on political views; or, at be&s;t, as falli|ble, and liable to be blended with a mix|ture of error and impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>But the pure truths of God are perfect and &s;ufficient, and can receive no light, nor &s;trength, nor efficacy, from any human &s;y&s;tems and decrees.</P>
<P>When we come to &s;tudy the&s;e, therefore, we &s;hould &s;tudy them as they are in them|&s;elves; con&s;ider them as they lye before us in their native &s;implicity; allow them al|ways to explain them&s;elves, and bring our|&s;elves to admit that &s;en&s;e of their &s;everal doctrines which we would naturally admit, had we no where el&s;e any account of the&s;e
<PB N="128" REF="137">
doctrines, but that genuine unadulterated account which they give us.</P>
<P>And, thus, &s;hould we all &s;hortly come, in the unity of the faith, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t. For there could be but little room for any di&s;|putes about the general &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, were we not previou&s;ly bewildered, by a blind attachment to certain &s;y&s;tems of opi|nions, which have been fal&s;ely impo&s;ed upon the world, as containing, in the &s;en&s;e of the impo&s;ers, the very e&s;&s;ence of &s;crip|ture, if not &s;omething much more infalli|ble, and efficaciou&s;ly enlightening.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we could once ri&s;e above the &s;ervility of prejudice; lay a&s;ide all tho&s;e &s;tandards of human pride and pre&s;umption which have been erected to determine the &s;en&s;e of the word of God; and be prevailed upon to &s;earch for the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture in the &s;criptures only; there would &s;oon be an end of mo&s;t of tho&s;e controver&s;ies which have di&s;tracted the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>No que&s;tions could, then, be &s;tarted about a Triune Being; about birth &s;in;
<PB N="129" REF="138">
about irre&s;i&s;table grace; or an infinite &s;atis|faction; about purgatory; &s;aint wor&s;hip; and tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; becau&s;e no &s;uch tenets are any where mentioned in the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Nor could any doubt ari&s;e, concerning the infinite goodne&s;s and mercy of God; his adorable love in our redemption; or that repentance from dead works, and holy con|ver&s;ation and godline&s;s which are univer|&s;ally required of men, becau&s;e almo&s;t the whole &s;criptures are taken up with the plaine&s;t declarations, and the mo&s;t forcible recommendation of the&s;e doctrines.</P>
<P>And as to any other differences that might &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t among&s;t us, concerning the meaning of &s;ome particular words, or phra&s;es, or any inferior concerns, the&s;e would all &s;oon be &s;wallowed up, in that mutual forbearance, harmony and love, which are &s;o clearly and repeatedly men|tioned in the &s;criptures, as ab&s;olutely in&s;e|parable from the Chri&s;tian life.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle, therefore, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'If the go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are
<PB N="130" REF="139">
lo&s;t;"</Q> that is, to tho&s;e that are lo&s;t through their own ob&s;tinate prejudices, or, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in whom the god of this world,"</Q> or &s;ome other attachment quite oppo&s;ite to the go&s;pel, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"hath blinded their eyes."</Q></P>
<P>To the hone&s;t and good heart, who exa|mines the &s;criptures as the only way of life, every thing, at lea&s;t every thing of impor|tance, will be quite ea&s;y; and he will daily grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t we are under the influence of prejudice, or re&s;olve to explain the &s;crip|tures according to &s;ome preconceived opi|nions of our own, or according to certain opinions of others, to whom we a&s;cribe the honour of infallibility; or, whil&s;t we read the &s;criptures only to confirm &s;ome old doc|trines, or to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome new doctrines, that have &s;uddenly &s;tarted up in our own imaginations, we may be ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</P>
<P>It is, al&s;o, to be ob&s;erved, that if we would &s;earch the &s;criptures to any purpo&s;e,
<PB N="131" REF="140">
we mu&s;t examine them as they &s;tand con|nected together; we mu&s;t throw off the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions; and we mu&s;t not have recour&s;e to them as a &s;ubject of mere curi|o&s;ity, nor for the &s;ake of &s;cience only. But, for the illu&s;tration of the&s;e, and of other remaining particulars, I mu&s;t refer you to the following di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>In the mean time we may learn from what has been &s;aid, why there are &s;till &s;o many wranglings, and angry debates among&s;t Chri&s;tians; &s;o much want of cha|rity, and &s;uch gro&s;s ignorance.</P>
<P>It is plain, that all tho&s;e evils are either owing to their not &s;earching the &s;criptures at all; or to their reading them with pre|judice; or to their entering only into a very partial examination of them. For, could they be once prevailed upon to conquer their prejudices, and to examine the &s;crip|tures fairly, they mu&s;t all &s;oon walk in the light, and live together in the mutual in|tercour&s;e of all the lovely affections, and of every kind, and friendly office.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="141">
We &s;hould, then, &s;ee and feel, that cha|rity is the grand di&s;tingui&s;hing feature of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Hence we &s;hould be taught to lay a&s;ide all wrath and malice.</P>
<P>We &s;hould again &s;ee, that the love of God and man, or that, to love God and keep his commandments, is the whole duty of man, and the true way to eternal life; and that this is the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;criptures from beginning to end.</P>
<P>Hence all divi&s;ions would in&s;tantly cea&s;e among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Making holine&s;s our grand aim, and for|bearing one another, and forgiving one ano|ther, we would &s;trive together for the faith of the go&s;pel, holding fa&s;t the word of truth, and &s;trengthening and comforting one ano|ther, in running the race that is before us.</P>
<P>Hence, then, we &s;hould be per&s;uaded, &s;eriou&s;ly to a&s;k our&s;elves, Are we under the influence of any degree of prejudice? And, if we are, what a hateful enemy has the dominion over us?</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">
Is there one for Paul, and one for Apol|los?</P>
<P>Do we go to the &s;criptures to vindicate any doctrines of men?</P>
<P>Do we maintain any doctrines which are never once mentioned in the &s;criptures?</P>
<P>Do we believe any doctrines to be the doctrines of &s;cripture, only becau&s;e they have been taught us by &s;ome venerable names?</P>
<P>Or, do we make no other u&s;e of the &s;criptures, than to force them into a kind of agreement with &s;ome particular &s;enti|ments, which we have either imagined our|&s;elves, or received from others?</P>
<P>Then let us con&s;ider, that we compli|ment our own wi&s;dom, or the wi&s;dom of others, to the di&s;paragement of the divine wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>And let us again con&s;ider, if this be the ca&s;e, what an in&s;ult we thus offer to the divine Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>And let us learn, therefore, to rely upon the divine wi&s;dom; to have recour&s;e to this
<PB N="134" REF="143">
only as altogether &s;ufficient for our &s;alva|tion; and to tru&s;t wholly to it, as our alone infallible guide to eternal life.</P>
<P>May we always walk according to this rule!&mdash;May we always thus &s;earch the &s;crip|tures! Amen.</P>

<P>TO learn <HI>how,</HI> or in what manner, we &s;hall &s;earch the &s;criptures to the be&s;t purpo&s;e, I propo&s;ed to &s;hew, that-we mu&s;t &s;earch them without prejudice; that we mu&s;t &s;earch them as they &s;tand connected together; that we mu&s;t not &s;earch them according to the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions; that we mu&s;t not &s;earch them as a matter of curio&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of mere &s;cience; that we mu&s;t not &s;earch them as if they were calculated for particular circum&s;tances only; and that we mu&s;t &s;earch them early and continually.</P>
<P>Having already &s;hewn, in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, that we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all pre|judice,
<PB N="136" REF="145">
if we would &s;earch the &s;criptures to our great advantage, I now proceed to ob&s;erve, in the &s;econd place, that if we would make any progre&s;s in knowledge, by &s;earching the &s;criptures, we mu&s;t not form our opinion of them from the &s;eeming ten|dency of particular, detached, unconnected pa&s;&s;ages thrown together; or that we mu&s;t not &s;tudy them in &s;craps, but according to the uniform tenor of them, and the rela|tion of each particular pa&s;&s;age to the whole context of which it is a part.</P>
<P>This is a piece of ju&s;tice which is due to all writings whatever; and which is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enable us to form any tolerable idea of the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of any writings.</P>
<P>For who can judge of an hi&s;tory from an accidental extract from it; or of a le&s;&s;on of morality, from an imperfect &s;elect &s;en|tence, or half-&s;entence, that may happen to be quoted from it?</P>
<P>We mu&s;t become acquainted with the general views of every author, and the principal point he aims at, to be able to
<PB N="137" REF="146">
under&s;tand him in particular places: and this object can be accompli&s;hed only by reading the whole that he has written.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not, therefore, &s;ingle out one text from one place, and another text from another place, either to acquire any clear &s;entiments of the grand de&s;ign of the whole &s;criptures, or of the particular de&s;ign of either of tho&s;e texts which we may have &s;elected. But to form a right judgment of the whole, we mu&s;t read the whole: and to form a right judgment of any particular pa&s;&s;age, we mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve what gave occa&s;ion to it; to what per&s;ons it is addre&s;&s;ed; and how it &s;tands connected with what goes before and follows after.</P>
<P>If, likewi&s;e, we would have a right ap|prehen&s;ion of any particular character, we mu&s;t view the whole of it at once.</P>
<P>The &s;ame direction mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, if we would under&s;tand any of tho&s;e divine exhortations that we meet with in the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, when any part of a &s;ubject oc|curs of which we would form a right judg|ment,
<PB N="138" REF="147">
it is nece&s;&s;ary to read the whole re|lating to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould touch, for in&s;tance, upon the de&s;truction of the antediluvian world, or upon the de&s;truction of Sodom and Gomorrah afterwards; to be able to form clear &s;entiments of the divine ju&s;tice, in tho&s;e tremendous effects of Almighty power, we &s;hould read the preceding hi&s;tory of the people &s;o de&s;troyed, and ob&s;erve all the rea&s;ons why the judgments of God were upon them.</P>
<P>Again, if we would endeavour to un|der&s;tand any one of our Lord's parables, it will not be &s;ufficient to read a part of the parable, but we mu&s;t read the whole at once, and likewi&s;e enquire into the occa|&s;ion upon which it was introduced, and al&s;o into the characters of tho&s;e to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>And, in particular, with re&s;pect to the epi&s;tles of the apo&s;tles, as each of the&s;e had &s;ome &s;pecial point in view, in order to form a right judgment of any part of each epi&s;tle, the whole, as Mr. Locke
<PB N="139" REF="148">
ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, &s;hould be read through at once.</P>
<P>The epi&s;tles, as the &s;ame admirable au|thor has ob&s;erved, were letters addre&s;&s;ed to particular churches in particular circum|&s;tances: and as we cannot comprehend the meaning of any common letter, by reading only a line, or &s;entence, at a time, and taking &s;everal months to read through the whole; neither can we, by pur&s;uing the &s;ame method, comprehend the force and &s;pirit of tho&s;e &s;acred letters, or indeed of any part of them.</P>
<P>But to be &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of at|tending to the connexion which every par|ticular pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture may have with what goes before, and follows after, &s;ome examples will probably furni&s;h the mo&s;t evincing evidence.</P>
<P>If, in the fir&s;t place, then, we &s;hould quote the&s;e words of &s;cripture, detached from their connexion with the context, <HI>There is no God,</HI> we &s;hould thus &s;train the &s;criptures to expre&s;s an Athei&s;tical language: but when we ob&s;erve the connexion they
<PB N="140" REF="149">
have with what goes before, we find that the words only contain the &s;tupid a&s;&s;ertion of a fool; and that, as it was a fool who &s;aid there was no God, the whole pa&s;&s;age, therefore, teaches us the folly of athei&s;m.</P>
<P>Again, by a detached arbitrary quota|tion from the &s;criptures, we might repre|&s;ent them as declaring that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was Antichri&s;t. For we might quote them in this manner: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h. This is a deceiver, and an Antichri&s;t.'</Q> But the whole pa&s;&s;age runs thus: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confe&s;s not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h. This is a deceiver and an Antichri&s;t.'</Q> <HI>This</HI> means, <HI>whoever</HI> of the&s;e who were already men|tioned; and the whole pa&s;&s;age, therefore, teaches, that they are deceivers and Anti|chri&s;ts, who deny that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Again, when we read, in the &s;ixth chap|ter of Gene&s;is, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts were only evil, and that continually,'</Q> we are not
<PB N="141" REF="150">
ha&s;tily to conclude that this was intended to be de&s;criptive of every man in the world; for we learn, a few ver&s;es after, that Noah was a righteous man, and per|fect in his generation. And we learn from the whole hi&s;tory, that all tho&s;e per&s;ons, the thoughts of who&s;e hearts were only evil, and that continually, were de&s;troyed for their great wickedne&s;s; but, on the contrary, that becau&s;e Noah was a totally oppo&s;ite character, he was, for this very rea&s;on, &s;aved from the general de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Again, in forming our ideas of any par|ticular character, we mu&s;t not determine the whole character from any of its parts; nor merely from the examination of any particular feature, pre&s;ume to give the cha|racter entire. For who, for example, could form any ju&s;t idea of the character of Da|vid, by either hearing that he was the <HI>man after God's own heart,</HI> or the man whom God had cho&s;en to be king; or by hearing, on the other hand, of his conduct towards Uriah?</P>

By &s;earching the &s;criptures fairly, we &s;hall learn, that David was neither a &s;pot|le&s;s, nor yet an altogether diabolical, but a very eccentric, mixed character: at one time very humble and pious; at another time revengeful and boi&s;terous; and, upon the whole, di&s;tingui&s;hable both for his great virtues, and for his great vices.</P>
<P>Again, when we are taught that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is our Saviour, we are not hence to conclude, that the God and Fa|ther of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not, like|wi&s;e, originally and &s;upremely our Saviour; for, by following our enquiries, we &s;hall find that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t did nothing of him&s;elf, but that all he did was by the power and authority of the Father; that it was by the direction and good plea&s;ure of the Father that the great &s;alvation was re|vealed, which was graciou&s;ly communi|cated to us by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that it was a faithful and univer&s;al obedience to all the Father's commandments, in accom|pli&s;hing the great work of our redemption, which, according to the Father's appoint|ment,
<PB N="143" REF="152">
has eventually con&s;tituted the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour: or, in other words, that it is God, the fountain of all mercy, grace, and love, who &s;aveth us by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, when we, likewi&s;e, learn that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, we mu&s;t egregiou&s;ly mi&s;take the ca&s;e, if we infer from this that he came into the world to &s;ave tho&s;e &s;inners, who pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly continue in their &s;ins. For a farther acquaintance with the &s;criptures will inform us, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t al&s;o came to call &s;inners to repentance; to redeem us from all iniquity; to purify to him&s;elf a peculiar, or excellent people, zealous of good works; and that we mu&s;t, therefore, endeavour to be pure and holy, or to walk even as he walked, to have any part in that great &s;alvation which he has propo&s;ed to us. Though it be true, therefore, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, yet we &s;ee, that the only meaning of this declaration is, that he came to turn &s;inners from dead works to &s;erve the living
<PB N="144" REF="153">
God, that they might thus become quali|fied for, and therefore a&s;&s;uredly obtain the inheritance of the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P>Again, if we return to the examination of hi&s;torical pa&s;&s;ages, and examine the hi&s;|tory of Lot and of his two daughters, and remember that they were re&s;cued from the de&s;truction which befel the other inhabi|tants of Sodom, we are not to conclude that they were altogether righteous, be|cau&s;e of this circum&s;tance. For Lot, be|fore he left Sodom, offered to do a thing which was very reproachful to him; and rather than having done which, he ought to have been willing to have &s;uffered any kind of death. And both he and his daughters afterwards were guilty of what was very &s;hameful and abominable. Their whole hi&s;tory, therefore, fairly examined, will lead us to ob&s;erve, that their righte|ou&s;ne&s;s was very far from being perfect; and that they were to be con&s;idered as righteous only in contradi&s;tinction to the horrid abo|mination of the Sodomites, though in other re&s;pects they were found tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="154">
And hence we may learn, that the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome of the per&s;onages of the Old Te&s;tament, &s;ometimes &s;ignifies no more than that they were not guilty of the crimes which others committed, to whom they are held up as a contra&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, when we con&s;ider the character of Abraham, though upon the whole it was mo&s;t excellent, con&s;idering the age of the world in which he lived, yet we are not to &s;uppo&s;e it ab&s;olutely &s;potle&s;s, con|trary to po&s;itive evidence. For though he was con&s;picuou&s;ly obedient to the divine laws, after he became acquainted with them, and went and &s;ojourned in a &s;trange land, not knowing whither he went, yet he was not always a wor&s;hipper of the true God, but was originally an idolater. And though he afterwards di&s;played &s;uch great faith in God, as ju&s;tly entitled him, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, to the appella|tion of the Father of the faithful, we are not yet to &s;uppo&s;e, that his faith never failed him in any particular in&s;tance. In the affair of Hagar, he &s;eems &s;o far to have
<PB N="146" REF="155">
di&s;tru&s;ted the divine promi&s;e, as to &s;uppo&s;e that it could not be accompli&s;hed in any other way. And his faith peculiarly failed him when he meanly denied his wife, and hazarded, by this denial, the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing con&s;equences; con&s;equences which he &s;hould have much more dreaded than the lo&s;s of life.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we, therefore, ju&s;tly admire his faith; admire it as un&s;peakably greater than that of any of his contemporaries, and as a&s;toni&s;hingly di&s;played in his readine&s;s to &s;acrifice his &s;on, we &s;hould not forget that it was not always quite uniform: and we our&s;elves, therefore, &s;hould watch and pray again&s;t temptation.</P>
<P>Again, if we examine the hi&s;tory of Jacob: though his po&s;terity were cho&s;en to inherit the promi&s;e made to Abraham and I&s;aac, and the po&s;terity of E&s;au were excluded from having any part in it; and though the promi&s;e made to Abraham and I&s;aac were repeated to Jacob, that in his &s;eed all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, yet we cannot help ob&s;erving
<PB N="147" REF="156">
many dark &s;hades in his character. The churli&s;h part which he acted towards his brother, when he was faint with hunger; the price which he demanded and obtained for a me&s;s of pottage, which he &s;hould have been willing to have purcha&s;ed for him; and the repeated fal&s;hoods with which he impo&s;ed upon his father, not to de&s;cend to other particulars, are far from repre&s;ent|ing him to us in a favourable light.</P>
<P>Even the illu&s;trious Jo&s;eph, who &s;ur|mounted the mo&s;t trying temptation, at the expence of his liberty, and of all his appa|rent worldly intere&s;ts; who preferred all the horrors of a pri&s;on to the violation of his duty; who&s;e magnanimity and genero|&s;ity were &s;o con&s;picuous to his brethren, who had &s;ought his life, and &s;old him into &s;lavery; who, on account of his &s;ingular virtues, mo&s;t &s;ignally pro&s;pered under the divine protection; and who, in every re|&s;pect, &s;tands high among&s;t the greate&s;t characters of antiquity, was, notwith&s;tand|ing, chargeable with &s;ome things which he ought not to have done.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="157">
Though his brethren de&s;erved no favour at his hand, yet he &s;hould not, to mortify and puni&s;h them, nor even to have di&s;co|vered their pre&s;ent temper, have departed from the truth, and accu&s;ed them with being &s;pies, when he was fully per&s;uaded that they were not.</P>
<P>He &s;hould not have a&s;&s;umed the charac|ter of a heathen, and &s;worn by the life of Pharaoh, contrary to that high allegiance which he owed to God, and from which no circum&s;tance &s;hould have diverted him.</P>
<P>He &s;hould not have puni&s;hed his inno|cent brother Benjamin, in common with his other brethren, by charging him with a theft of which he was not guilty, and threatening to reduce him to a &s;tate of bondage.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould he have taken that advantage of the nece&s;&s;ities of the people of Egypt, which the opportunity afforded him to in|volve them in oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery; and thus to do that which probably laid the foundation of the &s;lavery of his own nation afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="158">
Pharaoh was too powerful before, as is evident from the &s;tory of the butler and the baker, as well as from other circum|&s;tances. And though Jo&s;eph owed him much gratitude for rai&s;ing him to great honor, and riches, and power; yet this gra|titude would have been mo&s;t fully and laudably manife&s;ted, by his endeavours to impre&s;s the king with &s;entiments of huma|nity, genero&s;ity, and benevolence, in&s;tead of arming him with a tremendous power, which placed his &s;ubjects in the &s;ituation of bea&s;ts of burthen.</P>
<P>He &s;hould have &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Pharaoh, you have now a golden opportunity of being enthroned in the hearts of your people; of di&s;playing your magnanimity, and of compelling all your &s;ubjects to love you as their father There is corn enough in Egypt to &s;upply all their wants. Let it be di&s;tributed freely. Or, at lea&s;t, let them have it for the price which was formerly received for it.'</Q></P>
<P>But in&s;tead of acting in this manner, Jo&s;eph fir&s;t purcha&s;ed all the people's cattle,
<PB N="150" REF="159">
then all their lands, and then their per&s;ons. And though he afterwards re&s;tored their &s;eed to &s;ow the lands, and allowed them four-fifths of their produce, yet the lands continued Pharaoh's, and the people were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their property, and degraded to a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage.</P>
<P>We &s;ee, therefore, that even Jo&s;eph was not, in all re&s;pects, a perfect character: and, therefore, that we &s;hould take into con&s;ideration his entire character, his few failings as well as his many and great vir|tues, to form a right e&s;timate of what he was.</P>
<P>And thus we &s;hould examine all the other characters that are de&s;cribed to us in the &s;criptures. For, otherwi&s;e, we may account their faults a &s;ort of &s;anction to us; and by giving into their weakne&s;&s;es, far exceed them in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, whil&s;t we fall greatly below them in their peculiar virtues.</P>
<P>And, to this purpo&s;e, we &s;hould remem|ber that the failings of great men are re|corded in the &s;criptures, not to lead us to indulge in the &s;ame failings, but, on the
<PB N="151" REF="160">
contrary, to guard us again&s;t them; and to teach us, in&s;tead of falling by the &s;ame temptations, to learn from their mi&s;carriage to exert a greater vigilance and circum|&s;pection, and to ri&s;e to greater purity of heart and life. We, therefore, find, that in the &s;criptures, no vice of any kind is ever ju&s;tified in any character: and, hence, we &s;hould be taught not to ju&s;tify; and, much more, not to copy any vice in any charac|ter. The apo&s;tles them&s;elves did not con|ceal, or palliate their imperfections; nor authori&s;e us to conceal or palliate them.</P>
<P>We &s;hould al&s;o remember, that the im|perfections attending &s;ome extraordinary characters under the Old Te&s;tament di&s;pen|&s;ation, afford no &s;anction to Chri&s;tians to run into the &s;ame imperfections. For we enjoy an incomparably greater light, and we have a perfect example propo&s;ed to our imitation, which we &s;hould hum|bly and earne&s;tly copy; whil&s;t we re|gard the failings of the be&s;t men before the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, as &s;o many memen|tos to us, &s;hewing what the be&s;t among&s;t
<PB N="152" REF="161">
us mu&s;t &s;till have been, if we had not been favoured with the all-efficacious light of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I might have con&s;idered the characters of Mo&s;es, Job, and many others; and have gone almo&s;t through the whole &s;criptures, in examining doctrinal pa&s;&s;ages to illu&s;trate the point before us: or to &s;hew that we can never fully under&s;tand the &s;criptures, without con&s;idering them as they &s;tand connected together; and endeavouring to comprehend the whole that is delivered upon every character, and upon every doc|trine.</P>
<P>But the examples which I have ju&s;t pro|duced will be &s;ufficient, I apprehend, to convince us, what &s;trange work we &s;hould make with the &s;criptures, unle&s;s we were to &s;tudy every &s;ubject in entire connexion with all its parts.</P>
<P>Indeed, by collecting particular pa&s;&s;ages, or &s;eparate mangled &s;entences; fixing upon the&s;e an arbitrary &s;en&s;e of our own, and rea&s;oning and concluding from them, with|out con&s;idering what goes before, or fol|lows after; we may make out almo&s;t any
<PB N="153" REF="162">
doctrine from the &s;criptures, and pervert the po&s;itive and obvious meaning of any books that were ever written.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that faith has &s;o often tri|umphed over charity; that an odium has been ca&s;t upon good works; and that the greate&s;t barbarities that ever di&s;graced the human kind, have been pretended to be authori&s;ed by the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Hence, al&s;o, characters approved, upon the whole, have been made a &s;tandard in every particular ca&s;e; and men have allowed them&s;elves to commit vices that are always condemned, becau&s;e &s;ome illu&s;trious men of old had been unhappily &s;urpri&s;ed into them. Thus, becau&s;e Jacob had been guilty of &s;ome unwarrantable practices, pre|tended Chri&s;tians have thought them&s;elves ju&s;tified in copying him deliberately in the&s;e practices: not con&s;idering that the example of Jacob can ju&s;tify nothing that is wrong; that they are furni&s;hed with a greater light than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and that they are ex|pre&s;sly forbidden &s;ome practices again&s;t which Jacob had no po&s;itive law.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="163">
But whil&s;t we carefully compare one part of &s;cripture with another, we may always &s;ee our way clear before us: at lea&s;t, we can never fall into any mi&s;takes that are re|pugnant to holine&s;s, but mu&s;t continually advance in the knowledge of the truth; whil&s;t the truth &s;hall make us free from the &s;ervitude of &s;in, enlighten our under|&s;tandings, and purify and refre&s;h our hearts.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only once more ob&s;erve, under this head, what I wi&s;h to recommend as a rule of great importance, that when the general tenor of &s;cripture is deci&s;ive con|cerning any particular doctrine, this is to be appealed to as our &s;tandard for deter|mining the &s;en&s;e of any &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages, which may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear to have a different a&s;pect. As the &s;ame fountain &s;endeth not forth &s;weet water and bitter, what Mo&s;es and the prophets, what Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles clearly and harmoniou&s;ly proclaim in a thou&s;and texts, they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to proclaim univer&s;ally. We &s;hould never enter into the &s;uppo&s;ition, that a few ob&s;cure texts may contradict the
<PB N="155" REF="164">
thou&s;and, nor explain the thou&s;and by them, but explain them by the thou&s;and; a&s;&s;ured, that if they be really parts of &s;crip|ture, they mu&s;t contain preci&s;ely the &s;ame doctrine.</P>
<P>According to this rule, the divine unity will be fully and irrever&s;ibly e&s;tabli&s;hed. For the unequivocal language of the whole, &s;criptures is, that there is only one God, one creator, one unchangeable and ever|la&s;ting &s;overeign, who has no equal, peer, or competitor; who is the God and Father of all, and the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who, therefore, could not be born, could not die, could not grow in wi&s;dom and &s;tature, could not be weary, nor hungry, nor thir&s;ty; could not &s;uffer pain, nor angui&s;h, nor &s;orrow; could not bow before the throne of another, nor be indebted to another for all his wi&s;dom, and power, and &s;trength; nor be compounded of different per&s;ons or of different beings. Surely, then, this univer&s;al language is not to be overthrown by one &s;purious text, 1 John v. 7. and three or four mi&s;tran&s;lated
<PB N="156" REF="165">
texts; which very texts, as they &s;tand, are far from expre&s;&s;ing the doctrine for which they are adduced. And, according to this rule, we &s;hall acquire the cleare&s;t views of the terms of our acceptance with God; of his great love in reconciling us to him&s;elf; and of all the important leading doctrines of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>But to accompli&s;h the object propo&s;ed to us by the requi&s;ition in the text, it will be farther nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;earch the &s;crip|tures, not according to the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions; nor out of curio&s;ity as a matter of mere &s;cience; nor as if they were cal|culated for particular circum&s;tances only; but as the &s;ource of our greate&s;t comfort, and riche&s;t trea&s;ure in all circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The mi&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion is as great an ob|&s;truction to our progre&s;s in knowledge, as the wor&s;t kind of prejudice; and is, in|deed, one of the principal feeding &s;prings of prejudice it&s;elf. Mere knowledge, al&s;o, unle&s;s our practice be corre&s;pondent with it, can be of no real u&s;e to us. And, un|le&s;s we perceive the importance of the
<PB N="157" REF="166">
&s;criptures to us in all circum&s;tances, we &s;hall be apt to neglect them entirely; or &s;hall reap but little advantage from them, when we accidentally make them a part of our &s;tudy. But I &s;hall again re&s;ume the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e particulars, upon which we have not &s;ufficient time to enlarge at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Let us be taught, in the mean time, if we have hitherto made only a partial exami|nation of the &s;criptures, or formed our judgment of the whole only from the &s;ound of particular pa&s;&s;ages, to pur&s;ue, for the future, a very different conduct; and mo&s;t carefully and attentively to compare one part with another.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;hall clearly di&s;cern the &s;pirit of the whole, and of all its parts; and con|tinually encrea&s;e in divine knowledge.</P>
<P>And thus, the more we read the word of God, the more &s;hall we perceive that it was planned by infinite wi&s;dom; and that in this, as in all his works, he is the God of order, harmony, and love.</P>

<P>AFTER con&s;idering our obligations to &s;earch the &s;criptures, I propo&s;ed to point out the be&s;t methods to be ob&s;erved in order to &s;earch them to our profit and advantage.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e I fir&s;t noticed, that we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all prejudices, or precon|ceived opinions concerning them; and, &s;e|condly, that we &s;hould not form our &s;en|timents of them, from the &s;eeming ten|dency of particular detached, unconnected pa&s;&s;ages; nor &s;tudy them in &s;craps, nor in half &s;entences, but as they &s;tand connected together.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168">
I now proceed to ob&s;erve, in the third place, that we mu&s;t &s;earch the &s;criptures, not according to the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions, but with an ingenuous di&s;po&s;ition of mind; endeavouring to be as willing to di&s;cover and relinqui&s;h our own failings, as to re|ceive fre&s;h light and &s;trength, towards e&s;tabli&s;hing us in upright &s;entiments and practices.</P>
<P>It needs &s;carcely be ob&s;erved, that we are all, without the utmo&s;t caution, liable to a variety of deceptions, and apt to in|dulge a precipitate confidence in our own judgment, in many ca&s;es, where we are palpably wrong.</P>
<P>Each of us may ob&s;erve, in &s;ome of our acquaintance, an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in particular practices, which are &s;o plainly reproachful to them, as, we think, mu&s;t con&s;tantly &s;trike them&s;elves with the mo&s;t forcible conviction: and yet we may find the&s;e per&s;ons not at all a&s;hamed of their con|duct, but ready to vindicate it upon every occa&s;ion; and ready, perhaps, to condemn
<PB N="161" REF="169">
tho&s;e who run not with them into the &s;ame exce&s;s of folly.</P>
<P>When any &s;uch in&s;tances occur, each of us &s;hould put the&s;e &s;erious que&s;tions to him&s;elf: May not I, likewi&s;e, whil&s;t I cheri&s;h an overweening conceit of my&s;elf, be under the &s;ame blindfold delu&s;ion in &s;ome re&s;pects, in which tho&s;e, whom I condemn, appear to me to be under in other re&s;pects? And, May there not be in me &s;ome &s;ins which I am, at pre&s;ent, far from e&s;teeming &s;uch, and to which I am particularly attached, for no other rea&s;on than this, that <HI>they mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et me?</HI> And the conclu&s;ion ari&s;ing from the&s;e re|flections ought to be, Let me examine all my own practices one by one, and &s;ee whether there be not &s;ome of the&s;e, which I now pur&s;ue and vindicate, which I would as warmly oppo&s;e, were it not for that &s;trong affection which I have contracted for my|&s;elf, through a perver&s;ely indulged habit and inclination?</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion, which is the principal founda|tion of prejudice, di&s;orders the whole intel|lectual
<PB N="162" REF="170">
frame, and mu&s;t, therefore, nece&s;|&s;arily mi&s;lead and deceive us.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Peter, therefore, informs us, that before we can receive any benefit from the word of truth, we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all malice, and all guile, and hypocri&s;ies, and envies, and evil &s;peakings.</P>
<P>The man who is determined upon mali|cious practices, will never, it is evident, pay any regard to tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of love which are inculcated in the &s;criptures. Neither will that hone&s;ty, &s;incerity, di&s;in|tere&s;ted joy in another's welfare, and that precept to render to all their dues, which are &s;o forcibly recommended to us in the &s;criptures, have any influence upon the mind, which is previou&s;ly re&s;olved to prac|ti&s;e the arts of deceit and hypocri&s;y, and envy and malice.</P>
<P>In like manner, he who makes money the fir&s;t object of his pur&s;uits, and is fixed in his purpo&s;e to hold it fa&s;t, will never be taught liberality from the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Nor can he, again, who is predi&s;po&s;ed, at all events, to gratify any of his inordi|nate

<P>Indeed, &s;uch a one is ab&s;olutely incapa|ble of di&s;cerning the ugly features of his own character.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e he is <HI>&s;elf-willed,</HI> he is, there|fore, out of the reach of all conviction.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e he delights in his iniquity, all its malignant qualities are concealed from his view; and he either will not hear, or but &s;lightly regard, any motives that can be urged again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, any &s;huffling excu&s;e will &s;atisfy him.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e he is frail, and, therefore, liable to involuntary errors, he will, hence, re|concile him&s;elf to known enormous tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions. And if, at the &s;ame time, he &s;hews a ju&s;t abhorrence of other vices, to which he has no temptation, nor any par|ticular propen&s;ity, his heart will be at ea&s;e; and he will flatter him&s;elf that he is ac|ceptable to God, and that he &s;hould be &s;o to his fellow-creatures.</P>

This circum&s;tance is mo&s;t &s;trikingly re|pre&s;ented in the character of David, king of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>His heart &s;mote him, when he cut off the &s;kirt of Saul's garment; though Saul, at the &s;ame time, hunted him for his life.</P>
<P>Who, then, could have ever &s;u&s;pected &s;uch a one of brutal violence again&s;t un|offending innocence?</P>
<P>Who could have &s;uppo&s;ed him capable of laying a &s;cheme to take away the life of a faithful &s;ervant?</P>
<P>But David, we again find, di&s;covered the utmo&s;t indignation, and the mo&s;t implaca|ble re&s;entment, again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed plun|derer of a poor man, who robbed him of his own ewe lamb.</P>
<P>Yet the &s;ame David was guilty of a more aggravated in&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion and vio|lence; was guilty of the complicated crimes of murder and adultery, without appearing to feel any great remor&s;e.</P>
<P>In the one ca&s;e, we &s;ee, he had no pa&s;|&s;ion to bias him; in the other ca&s;e, he was blinded and rendered in&s;en&s;ible by the whirl|wind

of his pa&s;&s;ion. And it would appear from the parabolical addre&s;s to him upon this occa&s;ion, that, had the prophet direct|ly accu&s;ed him of real crimes, he might, great as they were, have made light of all his remon&s;trances. Nay, he was po&s;&s;ibly capable, at this time, of reading a pathetic lecture to others again&s;t his own crimes, without bringing the charge home to him|&s;elf. Or, if he thought of his own parti|cular ca&s;e, he might have invented &s;uch a number of alleviating circum&s;tances, as would, in his opinion, have almo&s;t entirely exculpated him.</P>
<P>Hence, then, we &s;hould be taught to con&s;ider the dreadful effects of being under the delu&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion; and how u&s;ele&s;s any in&s;tructions mu&s;t be to us, whil&s;t we are &s;ubject to its tyrannical influence.</P>
<P>And totally to &s;ubdue all our pa&s;&s;ions, and to enable us to read the &s;criptures with candour and impartiality, and a full &s;cru|tiny into our own hearts, we &s;hould con&s;i|der that nothing is the le&s;s criminal in it|&s;elf, becau&s;e we are the per&s;ons guilty of it;
<PB N="166" REF="174">
that what is criminal in one, is equally cri|minal in all who are exactly in the &s;ame circum&s;tances of light and knowledge; and that neither our inclinations nor our in|tere&s;ts can alter the nature of lying, extor|tion, debauchery and inju&s;tice, or of any other vice.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, becau&s;e we may be, at pre|&s;ent, reconciled to particular practices, or aver&s;e to particular duties, or &s;trong|ly convinced of the truth of particular opinions, we &s;hould not, therefore, pro|nounce &s;uch practices innocent, nor &s;uch duties unrea&s;onable, nor &s;uch opinions in|conte&s;tible. Much le&s;s &s;hould we, upon this pre&s;umption, either &s;earch the &s;crip|tures to endeavour to per&s;uade our&s;elves that they do not forbid &s;uch practices; or to explode, or find fault with them where they do; or to be confirmed in the belief that they excu&s;e our compliance with &s;uch duties, or that they ju&s;tify &s;uch particular opinions; but we &s;hould fir&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly, coolly, and impartially con&s;ider, what the &s;criptures them&s;elves &s;ay, after we have
<PB N="167" REF="175">
carefully compared one part with another, and then candidly appeal to our own hearts: Are not all tho&s;e opinions which they teach, in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with the wi&s;dom of God? And are not all tho&s;e duties which they inculcate, altogether worthy of him to require; and every way becoming man to perform? And is it not e&s;&s;ential to our true dignity and happine&s;s, to walk exact|ly according to that pattern, which they hold up to view as the &s;tandard of our imitation?</P>
<P>In this manner we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee the beauty, perfection and excellence, of every line of that wi&s;dom which de&s;cended from above; and whil&s;t we perceived by a happy experience, that our under&s;tandings were enlightened, we &s;hould gradually find that all our lu&s;ts were mortified and &s;ub|dued. I repeat the &s;entiment, that if we would fir&s;t deliberately &s;earch the &s;crip|tures, to ob&s;erve what doctrines they clear|ly reveal, and then &s;eriou&s;ly appeal to our own hearts, Are not &s;uch doctrines rea&s;on|able and every way worthy of us? There is
<PB N="168" REF="176">
not a &s;ingle vice which they condemn which we would not al&s;o condemn; nor a &s;ingle virtue which they enforce which we would not al&s;o approve.</P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ion, like a tempe&s;t at &s;ea, will carry us out of the way that we &s;hould go; will ca&s;t us headlong when we expect to move on &s;teadily; and, whether we will or not, will roll its billows over us: and, if it increa&s;e or continue, will fru&s;trate all our endeavours to re&s;i&s;t it, and, at la&s;t, leave us a melancholy wreck on the &s;hore of de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation might be illu&s;trated at large, by examining various pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, and con&s;idering the various &s;en&s;es which different men of oppo&s;ite opinions have put upon them; and by again con&s;i|dering the uniform and obvious &s;en&s;e, which all &s;ober, impartial, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate per|&s;ons would naturally put upon them.</P>
<P>But without enlarging upon this head, I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew, in the next place, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to build our&s;elves up firmly in our mo&s;t holy faith, we &s;hould, al&s;o,
<PB N="169" REF="177">
learn, not to &s;earch the &s;criptures as a matter of curio&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of mere &s;cience."</Q> For if we &s;earch them only with this view, or ju&s;t to obtain the in|&s;ignificant honour of being able di&s;putants, or the paltry triumph of quibbling &s;ophi&s;ts, we might as well have been engaged in ma|thematical problems, or in arithmetical cal|culations, or in any other &s;peculative in|ve&s;tigations whatever.</P>
<P>We need only con&s;ider in proof of this, the grand original de&s;ign of the &s;criptures, as the highly benevolent purpo&s;e of Al|mighty God, in furni&s;hing us with tho&s;e rich trea&s;ures which they contain.</P>
<P>And this was, we know, not to amu&s;e, but edify; not to teach us philo&s;ophy, nor to rack our thoughts with deep &s;pecula|tions, but to teach us to know our&s;elves; not to make us expert in &s;ubtle di&s;tinctions and conci&s;e and elegant rea&s;onings, but to make us a&s;hamed of vice, to abhor it, and fly from it; nor to enlighten the under|&s;tanding only, or communicate mere know|ledge
<PB N="170" REF="178">
to men, but to reform, purify, and e&s;tabli&s;h their hearts.</P>
<P>Mere knowledge puffeth up, genders pride, and other evil pa&s;&s;ions, and pro|duceth envy and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>But that knowledge which is reduced to practice; which is applied to awaken and diffu&s;e all the good affections; to extricate the mind from the bondage of corruption; and to produce in us the likene&s;s of our great original; is alone edifying and vene|rable, and &s;hould ever engage our earne&s;t attention and pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>We learn, accordingly, as I have parti|cularly &s;hewn in a former di&s;cour&s;e, that the &s;criptures were given us to make us wi&s;e to &s;alvation; to give us &s;uch an amiable and endearing view of all the divine perfections as &s;hould lead us to love, adore and &s;erve, our Almighty Sovereign, by the be&s;t pre|cepts and the be&s;t examples; to ennoble and perfect our nature; to emancipate us from every deba&s;ing folly and practice; to re|move our imperfections; to re&s;cue us from every corruption; to elevate us to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="171" REF="179">
of real greatne&s;s; and to yield peace, and hope, and joy, and everla&s;ting life, to our heaven-born &s;ouls.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, therefore, &s;earch the &s;crip|tures purely with this view. To this mo&s;t important purpo&s;e, we &s;hould apply every particular doctrine that they offer to our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>We &s;hould remember, that they are communicated by the Father of lights; and we &s;hould gratefully regard them as that living bread which came down from heaven.</P>
<P>We &s;hould read them, therefore, to en|liven and nouri&s;h our better part; to im|mortalize tho&s;e &s;pirits which God has given us; to awaken our con&s;ciences; to impre&s;s the divine image upon our hearts; to in|&s;pire us with patience and re&s;ignation to all the divine appointments; to prepare our|&s;elves to be always ready to appear before the awful tribunal of judgment on the la&s;t day; and to con&s;train us to love one ano|ther even as Chri&s;t loved us; that, as he
<PB N="172" REF="180">
now liveth, we may live al&s;o, and reign and triumph with him for ever.</P>
<P>At every repeated exhortation that we read or hear, or that at any time comes acro&s;s our thoughts, we &s;hould a&s;k our|&s;elves, Is this exhortation &s;uited to our cir|cum&s;tances? Does that vice belong to us, which it is calculated to heal? or, Are we de&s;titute of that virtue which it authorita|tively recommends?</P>
<P>And whil&s;t on the one hand, we are charmed with the loveline&s;s of truth; made to admire the grandeur and beautiful pro|portion of every principle of goodne&s;s; and &s;hocked at the deformity, irregularity, and forbidding features of every &s;pecies of ini|quity; we &s;hould endeavour, on the other hand, to confirm every holy re&s;olution and virtuous practice, by attentively &s;urveying all the plea&s;ures of religion, and by con|&s;tantly calling to mind the threatnings de|nounced again&s;t all impenitent &s;inners, and all the divine promi&s;es to the righteous. Is this, or that threatening, we &s;hould &s;ay,
<PB N="173" REF="181">
directly pointed again&s;t us? Or, is this, or that promi&s;e, revealed in our favour? And, as we continue our enquiries, we &s;hould be con&s;tantly &s;earching our own hearts, that we may daily advance more and more to all that perfection which the &s;criptures re|quire, and to which they &s;o powerfully lead.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord &s;aid to Jo&s;hua, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This book of the law &s;hall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou &s;halt <HI>meditate</HI> there|in continually, <HI>that thou maye&s;t ob&s;erve to do</HI> according to all that is written; for then thou &s;halt make thy way pro&s;per|ous, and then thou &s;halt have good &s;uc|ce&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Thus, we likewi&s;e find, that the P&s;alm|i&s;t con&s;idered the word of the Lord, not as a matter of curio&s;ity and amu&s;ement, or an object to entertain or employ the attention of &s;peculative men, but as what aimed at infinitely higher purpo&s;es; and what, there|fore, &s;hould be always particularly applied to the&s;e purpo&s;es. He, therefore, &s;ays,
<PB N="174" REF="182"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light unto my path."</Q></P>
<P>But how much greater &s;till is the light which we enjoy in that additional revela|tion with which we have been favoured &s;ince the days of the P&s;almi&s;t? And how much more earne&s;tly &s;hould we apply it to the gracious purpo&s;e for which it was be|&s;towed? We &s;hould take it up as the light from heaven, and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heavenly Father, guide us by this light to heaven!"</Q></P>
<P>We &s;hould re&s;olve to be directed by it to that other glorious world, which it opens to our view.</P>
<P>We &s;hould regard all the things that be|long to our peace.</P>
<P>We &s;hould lay a&s;ide every weight, and the &s;ins that more ea&s;ily be&s;et us.</P>
<P>We &s;hould take Chri&s;t's yoke upon us, and learn of him, and find re&s;t to our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The next ob&s;ervations, which I propo&s;ed to make were, that when we &s;earch the &s;criptures, we &s;hould con&s;ider them as ap|plicable
<PB N="175" REF="183">
to us in all circum&s;tances; we &s;hould endeavour to inve&s;tigate the mean|ing of the more ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages by tho&s;e that are plain and ea&s;y; we &s;hould be di|rected in our enquiries by tho&s;e other lights which God has given us; we &s;hould di&s;|tingui&s;h between mere hi&s;tory, and that which comes under the denomination of revelation; and we &s;hould &s;earch them early and continually.</P>
<P>I had no thoughts, at fir&s;t, of extending the &s;ubject to &s;o great a length. But it is as copious as it is important. And, as we cannot well be&s;tow too much pains upon it, I &s;hould hope that &s;ome farther ob&s;er|vations will be read with patience and candor.</P>
<P>Let us learn, in the mean time, to lay our minds open to all the &s;acred impre&s;&s;ions of truth; and let us pray for a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper, for pious, heavenly affections, and for an univer&s;al attention to the things that belong to our peace; le&s;t, when it might be expected, that we &s;hould be in the ca|pacity
<PB N="176" REF="184">
of becoming teachers to others, we our&s;elves &s;hall be found ignorant of the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God.</P>
<P>And may this &s;upremely glorious Be|ing, of his infinite mercy, do for us abun|dantly, above all that we are able to a&s;k or think, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Di&s;cour&s;e the Seventh on this Subject.]</HEAD>
<P>IN endeavouring to &s;hew in what manner we mu&s;t &s;earch the &s;criptures, to derive the greate&s;t advantage from them, I have already ob&s;erved, that we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all prejudice, or preconceived opinions con|cerning them; that we mu&s;t not form our &s;entiments of them from the &s;eeming ten|dency of particular detached &s;entences, but &s;tudy them as they &s;tand connected toge|ther; that we mu&s;t not be influenced by the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions; and that we mu&s;t not &s;earch them as a matter of curio&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of mere &s;cience, but with a view to the growing improvement and felicity of our minds.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="186">
I now proceed to ob&s;erve, in the next place, that we mu&s;t not &s;earch them as calculated for particular circum&s;tances only, but as adapted for our benefit in all circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>If we conceive of them as of u&s;e to tho&s;e only, who labour under depre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances; to &s;oothe and feed them with better hopes, but not nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who are &s;urrounded with the ble&s;&s;ings of friend&s;hip, ea&s;e, affluence, and power, we &s;hall find them but a dull book.</P>
<P>We cannot be deeply intere&s;ted in that which we per&s;uade our&s;elves has no mate|rial relation to our own concerns; nor can we, therefore, feel the force of any of tho&s;e con&s;olations which &s;uch an object is &s;uited to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, when it comes to be our turn to be tho&s;e per&s;ons for who&s;e benefit we think the &s;criptures are properly adapted, can we derive from them that imagined relief and comfort with which we may have before ab&s;urdly flattered our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="187">
The man who can reconcile him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures in the hour of adver&s;ity only, will then find them load him with the mo&s;t &s;tinging reproaches for his pa&s;t inattention to them; and will then &s;ee, if he &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider them, that it has been owing to his neglect of them in his pro&s;perity, that his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s is &s;o great as it is. For, had he previou&s;ly de|lighted in the divine te&s;timonies, and made them his coun&s;ellors, he would find the light of God's countenance &s;hining upon him in the mo&s;t overwhelming calamities. Therefore the P&s;almi&s;t &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Thy &s;tatutes have been my &s;ong in the days of my pilgrimage.'</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is a &s;erious &s;tudy of the &s;crip|tures which throws the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings into a &s;cene of pro&s;perity. They lift the &s;oul to God as the author of every good and perfect gift. They impre&s;s us with the highe&s;t gratitude for all his ble&s;&s;ings. They teach us humility and moderation; and &s;o make us &s;atisfied from our&s;elves. They form us to an acquie&s;cence in the
<PB N="180" REF="188">
divine good will and plea&s;ure; and thus prepare us for all the &s;ucceeding changes of our being.</P>
<P>And, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, we &s;ee, that they are nece&s;&s;ary to us at all times. With this view, therefore, we &s;hould apply to them continually, that we may never apply to them in vain; and that, when we mo&s;tly need tho&s;e animating refre&s;hments which they afford, we may find them flow upon us beyond our mo&s;t enlarged expectations.</P>
<P>Thus &s;hall we find them &s;upport us in the vale of adver&s;ity, as well as on the &s;um|mit of riches; and in the di&s;&s;olving &s;trug|gles of death, as well as in the perfection of health and &s;trength. And thus, whil&s;t we think mo&s;t honourably of the &s;criptures, &s;hall we truly rejoice in tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges which they propo&s;e to all ranks and conditions of men; and e&s;teeming them our be&s;t trea&s;ure, &s;hall be rightly prepared for making that improvement of them which we ought to make.</P>
<P>Thus the poor will rejoice to find that the go&s;pel is preached to them.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="189">
Thus the rich al&s;o will cheerfully &s;ubmit to that humility to which they are called, in hope of the glory which &s;hall hereafter be revealed.</P>
<P>Thus the wi&s;e as well as the unlearned, and the Jew as well as the Gentile, and all people of all nations, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, will perceive the propriety and energy of that appellation, which is given them by the apo&s;tle Paul; namely, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that they are the grace of God, which hath appeared bringing &s;alvation unto all men, teaching them that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, they &s;hould live &s;oberly and piou&s;ly in this pre&s;ent world, look|ing for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>But whil&s;t we injuriou&s;ly con&s;ider them as a partial di&s;pen&s;ation of God, that was never intended for univer&s;al benefit, or only de&s;igned to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of &s;ome in|dividuals; arbitrarily to &s;ave a certain deter|minate number of the human &s;pecies, and as arbitrarily to reprobate all the re&s;t; what
<PB N="182" REF="190">
joy can they, then, pour into their hearts? What &s;acred veneration can we, then, enter|tain for them? Can we, then, indeed, &s;eri|ou&s;ly e&s;teem them the wi&s;dom of God? Or, if we can, what deba&s;ing &s;entiments mu&s;t we then form of his &s;upreme Maje&s;ty? How infinitely mu&s;t we di&s;honour and bla&s;pheme his holy name? We cannot, in this ca&s;e, rejoice in him as the Father of mercies. We cannot rejoice in him as gracious, ac|ce&s;&s;ible, and di&s;po&s;ed to extend his rich &s;alvation to all his creatures. We cannot look up to him with that grateful homage, and with that adoring complacency, as when we behold him calling all men every where to repent; in&s;tructing the wi&s;e as well as giving under&s;tanding to the &s;imple; and revealing him&s;elf, without any exception, the infinite God of infinite love to every rational being under heaven.</P>
<P>To &s;earch the &s;criptures, then, to any purpo&s;e, or rightly to under&s;tand, heartily to embrace, &s;eriou&s;ly to apply, and truly to admire and love, tho&s;e divine in&s;tructions which they contain, we &s;hould con&s;ider
<PB N="183" REF="191">
them, as indeed they are, not calculated for particular circum&s;tances only, but for all circum&s;tances; and as offering the be&s;t comforts, and the mo&s;t invaluable trea&s;ures, peace and reconciliation, with God our Father, to all ranks and conditions of men.

<P>I would ob&s;erve, in the next place, and this demands our greate&s;t attention, that when we &s;earch the &s;criptures, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'we &s;hould endeavour to inve&s;tigate the meaning of the more difficult pa&s;&s;ages by tho&s;e that are plain and ea&s;y.'</Q></P>
<P>It would be truly a&s;toni&s;hing if there were not &s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood in the &s;criptures.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="192">
Addre&s;&s;es, which had a relation to pecu|liar prevailing cu&s;toms, and which came with a mo&s;t awakening energy to per&s;ons acquainted with &s;uch cu&s;toms, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily become ab&s;tru&s;e when tho&s;e cu&s;toms are di&s;u&s;ed or forgotten.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the variety of changes to which all languages are liable, and the different ideas which are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively annexed to dif|ferent words, and to the &s;ame words in different ages, without a con&s;tant divine in&s;piration, mu&s;t render many things ob|&s;cure in all antient writings whatever.</P>
<P>But it is to be ob&s;erved, that the diffi|culties which occur in the &s;criptures, are not without their u&s;e. They &s;erve to awaken our attention; to rou&s;e us to con|&s;ideration and enquiry; to exerci&s;e the genius of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and learned; and therefore lead us to a more frequent intercour&s;e with the &s;acred contents of the &s;criptures, than if the whole were &s;o ea&s;y as to be perfectly under&s;tood by reading them over once or twice.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="193">
But, here, it is again to be ob&s;erved, that the beauty and excellency of the &s;criptures con&s;i&s;t in this; that the way of &s;alvation, which is there propo&s;ed to us, is perfectly intelligible to per&s;ons of the meane&s;t capa|city; indeed to all per&s;ons whatever, who are but a degree removed from a &s;tate of idioti&s;m.</P>
<P>When we either recapitulate the perfec|tions of the great Jehovah, or de&s;cribe tho&s;e terms of pardon and reconciliation which he here offereth to our acceptance, every one mu&s;t under&s;tand what &s;entiments are intended to be conveyed. Every one mu&s;t know what is meant by the terms, when we learn that there is only one true and living God; that he is the creator and pre|&s;erver of all things; that he is the author of all our benefits and enjoyments; that he is good to all; that his tender mercies are over all his works; and that he is gra|cious, forbearing, and long-&s;uffering to the children of men, and not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come unto him and be &s;aved.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="194">
Again, every one mu&s;t know what is meant, when we are informed that &s;in is di&s;plea&s;ing to the holy Maje&s;ty of heaven: and that, therefore, as we have all &s;inned, we &s;hould all for&s;ake our &s;ins, or repent, and be converted, that our &s;ins may be blotted out.</P>
<P>Every one, al&s;o, mu&s;t clearly perceive, what is meant by lying, &s;wearing, covetou&s;|ne&s;s, extortion, malice, pride, envy, deceit, contention, drunkenne&s;s, adultery, murder, and other works of darkne&s;s; and what is meant, when we are told that none who continue in the practice of the&s;e vices &s;hall inherit the kingdom of heaven, but &s;hall be puni&s;hed with eternal death.</P>
<P>Nor can any one be a &s;tranger to what is under&s;tood by humility, meekne&s;s, com|pa&s;&s;ion, mercy, prayer, and prai&s;e to God, the doing to all others as we would that they &s;hould do to us, and the delighting in all the commandments of God.</P>
<P>Again, when we learn that God will turn unto us, if we turn unto him; that he will never leave us nor for&s;ake us, if we
<PB N="187" REF="195">
&s;incerely endeavour to obey him; that he will not &s;uffer his &s;ervants to be tempted above what they are able; and that, if we love him, and keep his commandments, death will not put an end to our being, but that he, who rai&s;ed up Chri&s;t from the dead, will, likewi&s;e, cau&s;e us to live be|yond this world; will make us to live for ever in the heavenly man&s;ions: I &s;ay, when any of the&s;e declarations are propo&s;ed to us, the dulle&s;t under&s;tanding mu&s;t clearly comprehend the force and &s;pirit of them.</P>
<P>When this, then, is the ca&s;e, when the way of life is obvious to all, and level to the very lowe&s;t capacity, what rea&s;on have we to complain of any of tho&s;e difficulties which &s;o frequently occur in the &s;crip|tures?</P>
<P>Or, if we wi&s;h to &s;urmount any of tho&s;e difficulties, or to acquire any tolerable knowledge of them, what other rational method can we propo&s;e to our&s;elves than to compare and explain them, according to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which are unque&s;tionably plain and obvious?</P>

But it is prepo&s;terou&s;ly ab&s;urd to explain what is clear, and what does not want ex|plaining, by what is doubtful, and therefore uncertain; or to explain, or rather to ex|plain away, the &s;imple&s;t truths, by under|&s;tanding literally a highly figurative pa&s;&s;age, which, being literally under&s;tood, is a con|tradiction to our &s;en&s;es. This would be as ridiculous and ab&s;urd as to explain a living language by a dead one; or as to pervert the &s;en&s;e of a language which we do un|der&s;tand, by interpreting it according to &s;ome random gue&s;&s;es of our own, concern|ing a language of which we are perfectly ignorant.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch is the &s;trange method which tho&s;e Chri&s;tians take, who attempt to ex|plain, or to explain away, all the mo&s;t plain and inconte&s;table doctrines of &s;cripture, by bringing them to the &s;tandard of an arbi|trary &s;en&s;e, which they have affixed to &s;ome of the ob&s;cure&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in the apo&s;tle Paul's epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>This is the more to be wondered at, as his brother Peter has expre&s;sly guarded us
<PB N="189" REF="197">
again&s;t &s;uch erroneous practices; having an eye at the &s;ame time to tho&s;e very difficult pa&s;&s;ages of Paul's epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>Peter had been recommending to his fellow Chri&s;tians, the mo&s;t holy conver&s;a|tion and godline&s;s, as the only &s;table foun|dation, which they could lay, of building them&s;elves up into eternal life.</P>
<P>This, he likewi&s;e informs them, was the con&s;tant doctrine of the apo&s;tle Paul; though &s;ome had perver&s;ely explained him as mean|ing the contrary.</P>
<P>He, therefore, warns us, whenever we meet with any difficulties in Paul's epi&s;tles, that the&s;e are never to be under&s;tood to give any encouragement to the &s;inner. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'We,'</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'according to God's pro|mi&s;e, look for a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s. Wherefore, beloved, &s;eeing that we look for &s;uch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without &s;pot, and blamele&s;s; and account, that the long-&s;uffering of our Lord is &s;alvation, even as our beloved Paul, al&s;o, according
<PB N="190" REF="198">
to the wi&s;dom given unto him, has written unto you; as al&s;o, in all his epi&s;tles, &s;peaking in them of the&s;e things, in which are &s;ome things hard to be under|&s;tood, which they that are unlearned and un&s;table wre&s;t, as they do al&s;o the other &s;criptures, unto their own de&s;truction. Ye, therefore, beloved, &s;eeing that ye know the&s;e things before, beware, le&s;t ye al&s;o being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s. But grow in grace, and in the know|ledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>Now here we may ob&s;erve, that, what|ever be the difficulties which occur in the apo&s;tle Paul's writings, there are none of them to be &s;o explained, as to lead us to believe, that God is not willing that all &s;hould be &s;aved; nor are any of them to be &s;o explained, as to give countenance to tho&s;e who continue in their &s;ins; but that we are to con&s;ider the whole of them, when rightly under&s;tood, as unitedly directing us
<PB N="191" REF="199">
to be without &s;pot and blemi&s;h; to be pre|pared for our Lord at his coming.</P>
<P>We may again ob&s;erve, that the <HI>un&s;table,</HI> who put a perver&s;e con&s;truction upon the doctrines of the apo&s;tle Paul, are united with the <HI>unlearned</HI> by the apo&s;tle Peter, to &s;hew us, that when they are willing to re|turn again to their beloved lu&s;ts, it is not &s;o much the fault of the under&s;tanding as the fault of the heart, which leads them to repre&s;ent Paul as expre&s;&s;ing a doctrine that is not according to godline&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the apo&s;tle James has al&s;o guard|ed us again&s;t an immoral interpretation of what his brother apo&s;tle &s;ays concerning our being &s;aved by faith; and &s;hewn us, that in this he never intended that good works were to be excluded, as having no connexion with the faith of the go&s;pel, by ob&s;erving, in po&s;itive language, that no faith whatever, without good works, can procure any man the favour of God.</P>
<P>Hence, then, we &s;hould learn, that as holine&s;s is the grand, obvious, and leading doctrine of the &s;criptures, every part of
<PB N="192" REF="200">
them con&s;i&s;tently under&s;tood, mu&s;t be in perfect harmony with this; that we &s;hould, therefore, cultivate the greate&s;t acquaint|ance with all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which mo&s;t clearly and po&s;itively inculcate this; and that, whil&s;t any pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to convey to us a contrary meaning, we remain in the dark concerning the meaning of the pa&s;&s;age; and &s;hould either put a different con&s;truc|tion upon it from what it, at fir&s;t view, &s;eems to bear; or, if we cannot thus ren|der it intelligible, &s;hould a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves that it is a mi&s;tran&s;lation, or a corruption introduced by &s;ome ignorant tran&s;criber.</P>
<P>It is obvious, as I have &s;aid, to the mo&s;t cur&s;ory ob&s;erver, that holine&s;s is the grand leading doctrine of the &s;criptures: and, as this is that doctrine which is univer&s;ally inculcated with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity and per&s;picuity, this, therefore, is to be our con&s;tant key to the meaning of every part of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;hall be per&s;uaded, that our being &s;aved by faith, can never imply that we can be &s;aved, according to the doctrines
<PB N="193" REF="201">
of the go&s;pel, without walking according to the laws of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;hall perceive, that tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages which are mo&s;t hard to be under&s;tood, can never, con&s;i&s;tently with the whole, warrant us to indulge in the lea&s;t violation of the divine laws.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;hall clearly &s;ee, that to honor Chri&s;t is to honor the Father who &s;ent him; and that to love Chri&s;t is to keep his commandments, as the grateful dependents, beneficiaries, and redeemed children of our Father; and, likewi&s;e, that all that Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered for us, is &s;o far from encouraging us to continue in &s;in, that it is intended, on the contrary, to be the mo&s;t powerful and effectual incentive to animate us, by a patient continuance in well doing, to lay hold on the crown of eternal life.</P>
<P>I might particularly illu&s;trate this point, by a variety of in&s;tances, which would lead us to the obvious &s;en&s;e of many noble pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>But, leaving you to make an application of what has been &s;aid to the&s;e purpo&s;es, I
<PB N="194" REF="202">
&s;hall proceed, in another di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject, to mention &s;ome remaining particulars, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily engage our attention, to pro&s;ecute, with &s;ucce&s;s, the divine &s;tudy which I have been re|commending.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us learn to explore the &s;en&s;e of the more difficult pa&s;&s;ages from tho&s;e which are &s;o plain, that none but the wilfully blind can mi&s;under&s;tand, or mi&s;|apply them. And, as the great God has revealed him&s;elf, that we may grow up into his likene&s;s, and be qualified for the joys of his heavenly kingdom, let us principally apply our&s;elves to this grand object; and labour, by an holy conver&s;ation, to obtain the divine favour, and all tho&s;e un&s;peak|ably glorious rewards, which await every true and faithful &s;ervant.</P>

<P>I Fir&s;t attempted, from the&s;e words, to point out our indi&s;pen&s;able obligations to ob&s;erve the direction which they con|tain. The&s;e obligations, then, being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, we &s;hould, hence, be naturally di&s;po&s;ed to attend to the proper methods to be pur&s;ued in &s;earching the &s;criptures to our great advantage.</P>
<P>And, to this purpo&s;e, I ob&s;erved, that we &s;hould, fir&s;t, lay a&s;ide all prejudice, or pre-conceived opinions concerning them. Secondly, that we &s;hould not deduce our &s;entiments concerning them, from the &s;eeming tendency of particular detached pa&s;&s;ages, or half-&s;entences, but &s;tudy them
<PB N="196" REF="204">
as they &s;tand connected together. Thirdly, that we &s;hould not &s;earch according to the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions, but with an ingenuous di&s;po&s;ition of mind, being as willing to di&s;|cover and relinqui&s;h our own failings, as to receive fre&s;h light and &s;trength towards confirming our&s;elves in upright principles and practices. Fourthly, that we &s;hould not &s;earch the &s;criptures as a matter of cu|rio&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of mere &s;cience. Fifthly, that we &s;hould not &s;earch them as if they were calculated for particular cir|cum&s;tances only, but for all circum&s;tances. And, once more, that we &s;hould endeavour to inve&s;tigate the meaning of the more dif|ficult pa&s;&s;ages, by tho&s;e that are plain and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars having been already explained, in as brief and intelligible a man|ner as I was able, I now proceed to ob|&s;erve, in the next place, that we &s;hould, al&s;o, in &s;earching the &s;criptures, be directed by tho&s;e other lights which God has given us.</P>
<P>Contradictions, it is mo&s;t evident, can never proceed from the God of all wi&s;dom
<PB N="197" REF="205">
and truth, and light and knowledge. As the &s;ame fountain cannot &s;end forth &s;weet water and bitter, much le&s;s can the only perfect Being in the univer&s;e deny him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But con&s;cience, we &s;hould remember, is the gift of God.</P>
<P>He, therefore, can have given us no other laws, which oblige us to violate the expre&s;s declarations of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>He can never command us, by a differ|ent authority, to put what we think dark|ne&s;s for light, or what we think light for darkne&s;s; or to wor&s;hip him in a manner that is repugnant to the clear dictates of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, al&s;o, is the gift of God: it is that primary light of heaven, which he hath given to be the light of every man in the world.</P>
<P>He, therefore, can never require us by any revelation, to believe things which are diametrically oppo&s;ite to rea&s;on. He can never require us to believe that one being is another being; that he who is greater than another, is only equal to another; that
<PB N="198" REF="206">
he who did nothing of him&s;elf, did all things of him&s;elf; that he who &s;ent another being, is that other being whom he &s;ent; or that there is no difference between three and one, or between one and three. Nor can he ever require us to believe, that bread is fle&s;h, or that wine is blood; or that a liv|ing being held him&s;elf dead in his own hands, and put him&s;elf dead into his own mouth; nor that the &s;ame individual body is wholly taken by millions of per&s;ons at the &s;ame time, and that each of the&s;e per|&s;ons has a whole body to him&s;elf, whil&s;t there is but one body broken and entire for them all. Neither can he require us to believe, that holine&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;alvation, and at the &s;ame time of no im|portance to us, but to be rather e&s;timated as filthy rags, forbidding and odious.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures were never intended to hoodwink or &s;ilence our con&s;ciences, but to awaken and enlighten them; nor to oppo&s;e or render our rea&s;on u&s;ele&s;s, but to direct and &s;trengthen it.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="207">
We &s;hould not endeavour, therefore, to &s;tifle con&s;cience and rea&s;on, when we are &s;earching the &s;criptures; nor &s;uppo&s;e that the language of the one is contrary to that of the other; but &s;hould examine the &s;crip|tures by our rea&s;on, and judge by our rea|&s;on what they &s;ay. Thus the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Prove all things;'</Q> he means by rea&s;on, that Gift of God that is born with us: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'and hold fa&s;t that which is good;'</Q> namely, that which, to our impartial rea|&s;on, appears to be &s;o. And it is only by following his advice that we can acquire any tolerable and con&s;i&s;tent knowledge of the &s;criptures. Nay, it is rea&s;on alone which can &s;atisfy us that God is their au|thor. But the farther we advance in our re&s;earches into them, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this luminous guide, the more &s;hall we &s;ee, and know, that they are the wi&s;dom of God, and the power of God. In our progre&s;s, every doctrine will &s;till more forcibly ap|prove it&s;elf to our unprejudiced rea&s;on: and we &s;hall find no practice forbidden there, which our rea&s;on does not al&s;o forbid; nor
<PB N="200" REF="208">
any practice authorized there, which our rea&s;on does not al&s;o authorize and applaud.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle, therefore, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The &s;pirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit!'</Q></P>
<P>Rea&s;on and &s;cripture, therefore, &s;hould always go hand in hand in our enquiries after truth, that we may know the truth, and that the truth may make us free.</P>
<P>But if we once renounce our rea&s;on, we give up our&s;elves an ea&s;y prey to all im|po&s;ture and wickedne&s;s; and may have our minds &s;o darkened, as even under the ima|ginary &s;anction of &s;cripture, to bla&s;pheme the mo&s;t obvious and important doctrine of &s;cripture, and to turn the whole into &s;corn and ridicule. But without &s;aying any more upon this head,</P>
<P>I &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve, in the next place, that we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between the hi&s;|torical and genealogical parts of &s;cripture, and tho&s;e which immediately relate to our conduct, and which were graciou&s;ly revealed for our benefit and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>All &s;cripture that is given by in&s;piration, is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
<PB N="201" REF="209">
correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But we need not &s;uppo&s;e, that the hi&s;tory of journies, famines, wars, marriages, and genealogies, were given us by in&s;piration; becau&s;e the writers, either from their own knowledge, or from the narratives of others, were &s;ufficiently qualified to furni&s;h &s;uch hi&s;tories, without any &s;upernatural know|ledge.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as all &s;cripture which is given by in&s;piration is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, &amp;c. it hence follows, that tho&s;e parts which convey no in&s;truction of any kind, in which neither virtue nor vice, nor the &s;upreme Governor of the world, nor a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, are mentioned, &s;uch as the book of E&s;ther, and the Song of Solomon, can have no claim to in&s;piration. Be&s;ides, al&s;o, in the hi&s;torical parts of &s;cripture, there are &s;ome practices related, and allu&s;ions introduced, which, though inoffen&s;ive in former ages, would be thought indelicate to be held up to view at pre&s;ent. And, as the whole
<PB N="202" REF="210">
ceremonial law of Mo&s;es, with re&s;pect to us, is now aboli&s;hed, the &s;tudy of it no farther concerns us than as a matter of &s;peculation, which can only indirectly edify us as a contra&s;t to the perfection of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, tho&s;e parts of &s;cripture which indi&s;pen&s;ably demand our earne&s;t attention and enquiry, are tho&s;e which teach us the doctrines of the kingdom of heaven; which di&s;play to us the divine perfections and our own obligations; which de&s;cribe the wretch|edne&s;s of the &s;inner, and the happine&s;s of the righteous; which point out to us the way of life; which give us the victory over &s;in and death; and lead us to glory, and honor, and immortality. The&s;e we &s;hould &s;earch daily, with all care and diligence, that we may grow up into the divine like|ne&s;s; that we may obtain that peace which the world cannot give, and have an en|trance admini&s;tered to us into the inheri|tance of the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P>I &s;hall once more ob&s;erve, that there are many pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;criptures which are
<PB N="203" REF="211">
erroneou&s;ly tran&s;lated; again&s;t which you have no immediate remedy, without com|paring one pa&s;&s;age with another, and con|cluding, that if any pa&s;&s;age be a contra|diction to it&s;elf, or to other plain pa&s;&s;ages, that is likely to be a mi&s;tran&s;lation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be a high gratification to all the lovers of truth, to learn that a new tran&s;lation of the Bible is now in great forwardne&s;s, which, from the approved learning and pro|found judgment of the gentlemen engaged in it, promi&s;es to rectify almo&s;t every mi&s;take in our pre&s;ent tran&s;lation, and to render the Engli&s;h &s;criptures much more edifying and de|lightful than we at pre&s;ent find them. The generous &s;ervices of &s;uch men are of more importance than thou&s;ands of vo|lumes upon metaphy&s;icks and politics. They are friends to our be&s;t intere&s;ts. Their object is to unfold to us the pure truths of God, as they lie before them in the original &s;crip|tures. They are, therefore, entitled to our admiration and gratitude, and &s;hould be affectionately e&s;teemed for their labours of love.</NOTE>. Thus, when we read in Galatians, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Him, who called you to another go&s;pel, which is not another,'</Q> we may be &s;ure that the pa&s;&s;age is mi&s;tran&s;lated; for <HI>another,</HI> and <HI>not another,</HI> is a contradiction to it&s;elf. Again, when we read in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle of John, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'We are in him that is true, even in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t,'</Q> we may al&s;o perceive that
<PB N="204" REF="212">
the tran&s;lation is erroneous; becau&s;e <HI>a dif|ferent being</HI> from <HI>him that is true,</HI> mu&s;t have been intended by <HI>the Son of him that is true.</HI> The pa&s;&s;age, therefore, &s;hould have been rendered, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'We are in him that is true, by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing over a variety of pa&s;&s;ages of le&s;s con&s;equence, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention &s;ome words, which are always improperly, and &s;ometimes ab&s;urdly tran&s;lated. The word <HI>charity,</HI> in our language, means nothing more than <HI>alm&s;giving,</HI> and conveys a very different meaning from the import of the word which is rendered <HI>charity</HI> by our tran&s;lators of the New Te&s;tament. We &s;hould always, therefore, in&s;tead of <HI>charity,</HI> read <HI>love.</HI> In like manner, we &s;hould di&s;|u&s;e the word <HI>grace,</HI> which is a Latin term, and to which an unintelligible meaning is frequently affixed, and, in&s;tead of this, &s;hould always read <HI>favour.</HI> As the word <HI>gho&s;t,</HI> al&s;o, conveys the idea of a <HI>phantom,</HI> we &s;hall do well, if, in&s;tead of the words <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> we were always to read <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="213">
But what I particularly wi&s;h to notice is, the word which in the original always &s;ignifies <HI>demon,</HI> or <HI>demons,</HI> but which our tran&s;lators have very ab&s;urdly, though uni|ver&s;ally, rendered <HI>devil,</HI> or <HI>devils.</HI></P>
<P>By a <HI>demon,</HI> the Jews under&s;tood a <HI>de|parted &s;pirit.</HI> And, as when any per&s;on was afflicted with <HI>madne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>the epilep&s;y,</HI> they always con&s;idered &s;uch a one as <HI>po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a demon; to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a demon,</HI> therefore, always &s;ignified with them, that the per&s;on thus &s;aid to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was afflicted with <HI>madne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>the epilep&s;y.</HI> But the word which in the original &s;ignifies <HI>devil,</HI> is very different from this: and, as that difference which &s;ub&s;i&s;teth in the ori|ginal &s;hould be al&s;o di&s;coverable in the tran&s;lation, to enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in which the one, from all tho&s;e in which the other term occurs, I &s;hall now fir&s;t enumerate every pa&s;&s;age of the New Te&s;tament, in which the word <HI>devil</HI> is to be found in the New Te&s;tament; and in which alone, therefore, it ought to have any place in the tran&s;lation.</P>

<P>I have now fini&s;hed the view, which I propo&s;ed to recommend to your notice, concerning the be&s;t methods we can pur|&s;ue in our &s;earch of the &s;criptures; and have, at the &s;ame time, endeavoured to be as brief as I could be, con&s;i&s;tently with per|&s;picuity.</P>
<P>The rules which I have laid down, you &s;ee, are obvious and ea&s;y; and &s;uch as I cannot help &s;uppo&s;ing every rational per&s;on
<PB N="209" REF="217">
mu&s;t allow to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our forming a right judgment of any writings whatever.</P>
<P>Your own reflections may furni&s;h you with many additional ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I &s;hall beg leave, however, to remind you again of &s;uch as we have been con&s;i|dering: and which are, I think, &s;ufficient, if not to lead us to the preci&s;e mean|ing of every particular pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, to give us notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a thorough knowledge of the whole, as will enable us to walk, at all times, in the way that we &s;hould go.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, then, as I have &s;hewn, &s;earch the &s;criptures without prejudice, or without forcing them to bend to any preconceived opinions of our own con|cerning them.</P>
<P>We &s;hould form our &s;entiments of them, not from any particular detached broken pa&s;&s;ages, but &s;tudy them as they &s;tand con|nected together.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not &s;earch them, according to the bias of our pa&s;&s;ions, but with an in|genuous
<PB N="210" REF="218">
di&s;po&s;ition of mind, being as wil|ling to relinqui&s;h every failing, as to re|ceive fre&s;h light and &s;trength, towards e&s;ta|bli&s;hing our&s;elves in upright principles and practices.</P>
<P>Again, we &s;hould not &s;earch them as a matter of curio&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of mere &s;cience, but with the view of applying them to the improvement of our hearts.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould we &s;earch them as if they were calculated for particular circum&s;tances only, but as our be&s;t trea&s;ure, and our great|e&s;t comfort in all circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Again, we &s;hould endeavour to inve&s;ti|gate the meaning of the more ob&s;cure and doubtful pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, by tho&s;e which are clear and certain.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be directed in all our enqui|ries, by tho&s;e other lights of our minds, which God has given us.</P>
<P>We &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between the ge|nealogical and hi&s;torical parts of &s;cripture, and tho&s;e which immediately relate to our conduct, and which were graciou&s;ly reveal|ed for our benefit and &s;alvation.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="219">
And we &s;hould &s;o receive our Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the &s;criptures as to make one part con&s;i&s;tent with another; and embrace every opportunity in our power to attain the true original &s;en&s;e of all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which are erroneou&s;ly tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>Now that we may faithfully regard, and univer&s;ally practi&s;e the&s;e plain rules, and that no di&s;couragements whatever may in|terrupt our application and continual pro|gre&s;s; we have only to call to mind again the many important and indi&s;pen&s;able obli|gations we are under to &s;earch the &s;crip|tures.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, we have &s;een, pay any due honour and prai&s;e to God; every di&s;covery of who&s;e will demands our mo&s;t cordial reception, our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration, and our devoute&s;t thank&s;|givings.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, &s;hew any &s;olici|tude to cultivate the mind, our better part, with the mo&s;t excellent, u&s;eful, and &s;atis|fying knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="220">
We cannot, otherwi&s;e, pur&s;ue the be&s;t methods of redeeming our&s;elves from the &s;ervitude of &s;in, and of becoming perfect in our mea&s;ure and degree as our heavenly Father is perfect.</P>
<P>We cannot, otherwi&s;e, make the be&s;t preparation for eternity; nor worthily re|gard the goodne&s;s, forbearance, and long-&s;uffering of God, which would lead us to repentance and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Nor can we, otherwi&s;e, make choice of the mo&s;t rational and daily-improving plea|&s;ures; plea&s;ures which are never weari&s;ome or di&s;gu&s;ting, but continually, more and more refre&s;hing, &s;trengthening, and de|lightful to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>But we need only keep an eye to this one endearing truth, namely, that the &s;crip|tures are fully able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, to make us &s;earch them with all diligence, in oppo&s;ition to all the vexations and di&s;quietudes of this tran&s;itory world.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we keep this point in view, nei|ther can all the flattering temptations, hy|pocritical

artifices, and di&s;maying terrours of all the men upon earth, nor could even the mo&s;t &s;tudied &s;ophi&s;try of an angel from heaven, di&s;&s;uade us from &s;earching the &s;crip|tures: but, expre&s;&s;ing the highe&s;t and mo&s;t unfeigned gratitude to God, in reflecting that they contain &s;o ine&s;timable a trea&s;ure as <HI>the true way to eternal life,</HI> we &s;hall rejoice in our happine&s;s, in having the priviledge of &s;earching them, and acknowledge that it is our greate&s;t wi&s;dom to &s;earch them early and continually.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, con&s;idering the &s;crip|tures as containing the pure will of God concerning our &s;alvation; as revealing the wonders of his love in our redemption; and calling us to the &s;potle&s;s realms of ever|la&s;ting day; we &s;hould be per&s;uaded to give the earlie&s;t application of all the powers of our &s;ouls to the &s;erious &s;tudy of them.</P>
<P>We, &s;urely, cannot begin too early, to lay the foundation of everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>As we know not what a day or a night may bring forth; or how &s;oon, or in what manner, we may be warned out of this
<PB N="214" REF="222">
world, we cannot begin <HI>too early</HI> to &s;ecure to our&s;elves a future glorious, and unfading inheritance.</P>
<P>We cannot begin <HI>too early</HI> to attain the pure&s;t knowledge, the mo&s;t refre&s;hing wi&s;|dom, and all the lovely graces of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and truth.</P>
<P>We cannot begin <HI>too early</HI> to know and adore our great Creator; to impre&s;s our hearts with the mo&s;t marvellous di&s;plays of his wi&s;dom and grace; and to be drawn by a review of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing acts of his love, to an imitation of his likene&s;s, and to that high glory which he is willing to be|&s;tow upon us.</P>
<P>Nor can any other exerci&s;es whatever, in which we can po&s;&s;ibly engage, afford us &s;uch con&s;olation and joy upon reflection; &s;o fully e&s;tabli&s;h our minds at all times; or make our &s;atisfactions grow upon us with our years.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle, therefore, commends Ti|mothy, becau&s;e <HI>from a child, he had known the &s;criptures, which were able to make him wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="223">
The&s;e elevated him above all the world, when its mo&s;t &s;oothing and delu&s;ive charms were prepared to lay hold of his affections.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hewed him, in the mo&s;t &s;triking point of view, the folly and vanity, the &s;hame, reproach, and mi&s;ery, attendant up|on every vice; and pointed out to him the true glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of a patient con|tinuance in well-doing.</P>
<P>The&s;e taught him how to live, and how to die; and to fear neither death nor the grave, becau&s;e of the joy that &s;hall hereafter be revealed.</P>
<P>And the&s;e taught him to be reconciled to all the unexpected events that could po&s;|&s;ibly happen to him, in the pre&s;ent fluc|tuating and trying &s;cene, becau&s;e they de|&s;cribe to us the eternal Father, and the righteous Governor of the world, as ever near to tho&s;e that call upon him, and as the &s;ure refuge, and exceeding great re|ward of all his faithful &s;ervants.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as we know what happine&s;s means, and can form any reli&s;h for happine&s;s, and are capable of ob&s;erving
<PB N="216" REF="224">
tho&s;e directions, which mo&s;t infallibly a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our way to happine&s;s, we &s;hould be|gin to &s;earch the &s;criptures; and, whil&s;t we maintain the highe&s;t reverence for all tho&s;e &s;acred le&s;&s;ons which they contain, we &s;hould u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible caution to enter into the true &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of them, and watch and pray, that we fall not into temptation, and a &s;nare.</P>
<P>But, once more, we &s;hould, likewi&s;e, be per&s;uaded to &s;earch the &s;criptures con|tinually.</P>
<P>The Bereans were applauded as more no|ble than tho&s;e of The&s;&s;alonica, becau&s;e they &s;earched the &s;criptures, to decide upon the truth of the doctrines of the apo&s;tles. And as they are not only our &s;ure guide to truth, but as we are continually &s;urrounded with dangers, we &s;hould have con&s;tant recour&s;e to the&s;e our be&s;t pre&s;ervatives from all dangers.</P>
<P>I do not mean that we &s;hould do nothing el&s;e. For whil&s;t we live in the world, we mu&s;t have a variety of employments, to exerci&s;e and engage our attention.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="225">
But, amid&s;t all other concerns, this &s;hould have one principal place.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the hurry and multiplicity of all human affairs, this one mo&s;t &s;alutary and important object &s;hould never be neglected.</P>
<P>We &s;hould delight in the law of the Lord, and in his law &s;hould we meditate day and night.</P>
<P>For if we be weary, here we have re&s;t.</P>
<P>If we be troubled on every &s;ide, here we have con&s;olation and good hope.</P>
<P>If we love life, and would &s;ee good days, here is the way, and the truth, and the life.</P>
<P>Here is wi&s;dom for the wi&s;e, &s;trength for the weak, comfort for tho&s;e who mourn, and a &s;overeign con&s;olation for the broken|hearted.</P>
<P>The P&s;almi&s;t, therefore, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thy te&s;timonies, O Lord, have I taken, as an heritage for ever; for they are the rejoicing of my heart."</Q></P>
<P>But his words are peculiarly applicable to tho&s;e, who enjoy all the invaluable ble&s;|&s;ings of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="226">
To them it may be e&s;pecially &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What more could be done in his vine|yard, that the Lord hath not done in it."</Q></P>

<P>He hath given light to tho&s;e who &s;at in darkne&s;s, and in the &s;hadow of death, that he might guide our feet in the way of peace.</P>
<P>And his mercy is on them who fear him, from generation to generation.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, for he hath vi&s;ited, and redeemed his people; and hath rai&s;ed up a horn of &s;alvation for us, in the hou&s;e of his &s;ervant David.</P>
<P>Come, then, let our &s;ouls magnify the Lord; let our &s;pirits rejoice in God our Saviour.</P>

<P>Let us not be di&s;obedient to the heavenly voice.</P>
<P>Let us not receive his grace in vain.</P>
<P>Let us wa&s;h, and be clean.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="227">
Let us, therefore, &s;earch the &s;criptures: let us &s;earch them daily, with that candor, impartiality, and &s;trict attention to their leading doctrines, and with that hone&s;ty and goodne&s;s of heart, which will cau&s;e them to be as a well of living water, &s;pringing up in us into eternal life.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSALS FOR PRINTING BY SUBSCRIPTION, A SERIES OF DISCOURSES, ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION. By the AUTHOR of this VOLUME.</HEAD>
<P>THE Work will be comprized in Two Octavo Volumes, and will be elegantly printed on good Paper.</P>
<P>It will be printed in the Cour&s;e of the next Year, if, previou&s;ly, a &s;ufficient Number of Sub&s;cribers come forward to countenance it.</P>
<P>No Money will be expected until the Work is com|pleted, and ready to be delivered from the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Price to Sub&s;cribers will not exceed Ten Shil|lings unbound.</P>
<P>The Author has often thought that &s;uch a Work was greatly wanted; and would, if properly executed, be an important Service to the Public. Infidelity is the Source of all tho&s;e de&s;troying Vices which take place among&s;t us. The Oppre&s;&s;or, the Extortioner, the openly Profane, and all the Wicked, mu&s;t be Infidels: at lea&s;t at the time when they give way to their &s;hame|ful Exce&s;&s;es. Even tho&s;e who are not now to be cla&s;&s;ed with the Wicked, but who have formerly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the divine Laws, mu&s;t be painfully &s;en&s;ible that all their pa&s;t Iniquities have originated in an evil
<PB N="222" REF="229">
Heart of Unbelief, by which they then &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be influenced. On the other Hand, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that any Man can deliberately violate the Laws of the Go&s;pel, whil&s;t he is fully per&s;uaded that it has God for its Author. As the firm Belief of the Go&s;pel, then, con&s;tantly impre&s;&s;ed upon the Mind, mu&s;t make all Men progre&s;&s;ively holy, and prepare them for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all its precious Promi&s;es, it is of infinite Importance to have this Belief e&s;tabli&s;hed by unan&s;werable Arguments.</P>
<P>But how can this be better accompli&s;hed than by &s;uch a Work as is here propo&s;ed? If the ri&s;ing Ge|neration were familiarized to the common Objections to Chri&s;tianity, and, at the &s;ame Time, were furni&s;hed with a &s;olid Refutation of them, Infidelity could not be &s;o common as it has been. A plain Repre&s;entation of both Sides of the Argument, in Language that could not be mi&s;under&s;tood, would &s;ecure the Faith of all our ingenuous Youth. Di&s;cour&s;es, to this Purpo&s;e, adapted to the U&s;e of Families, and read to them two or three Times in the Cour&s;e of their Advancement to Years of Maturity, would prepare them for encoun|tering an Adver&s;ary without the Ri&s;que of a Defeat. But when the ri&s;ing Generation is neglected in this Re&s;pect; taught an implicit Faith; never apprized of the common Objections to Chri&s;tianity, nor furni&s;hed with rational Arguments in its Defence; the Con&s;e|quence is ju&s;t what might be expected, that low Wit|tici&s;ms, &s;ucceeded by a Train of artful Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions, drive many of them into the gloomy Regions of Infidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="230">
The Object, therefore, which is here held out to view, is confe&s;&s;edly a good one.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that we have already many com|plete Defences of Chri&s;tianity. This is acknowledged with Plea&s;ure and Gratitude, whil&s;t it cannot be de|nied, that the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e are either too bulky, or too profound for the common Cla&s;s of Readers.</P>
<P>A Defence contained in a regular Series of Sermons, level to every Capacity, appears to the Author to be particularly wanted: and, though he is willing to do his utmo&s;t, he will rejoice in Silence, &s;hould any abler Hand come forward, and more perfectly effect the Good he aims at.</P>
