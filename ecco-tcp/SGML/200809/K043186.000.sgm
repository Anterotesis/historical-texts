<L>You pre&s;s the Wedding Day, and cry,</L>
<L>Come, let's to church, my dear, and try</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</STAGE>
<P>My dear Conte&s;t, I congratulate us both that your travels are completed, and that you are come to ta&s;te, for the remainder of your life, the joys of your own country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether to ta&s;te joy or &s;orrow I am yet in doubt; for I am uncertain in what manner I &s;hall be received by my father.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not you &s;een him yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No:&mdash;nor dare I till I know in what humour he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a good one, you may depend upon it; for he is very lately married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my utter concern! I heard &s;ome time ago indeed, that it was his de&s;ign to marry again; but as he has never conde&s;cended to make me acquainted with it him&s;elf, I know nothing far|ther re&s;pecting the marriage than what public report has thrown in my way. Pray can you tell me who my new mother is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am told &s;he is very young, extremely lively, and prodigiou&s;ly beautiful. I am told too that &s;he has been confined in the country, dre&s;&s;ed, and treated like a child, till her pre&s;ent age of eighteen, in order to pre&s;erve the appearance of youth in her mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who is her mother? Of what family is &s;he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I don't know&mdash;and I &s;uppo&s;e your fa|ther did not con&s;ider of what family &s;he was, but merely what family &s;he was likely to bring him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have no doubt but he married on pur|po&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="6">
to di&s;inherit me, for having written to him, "that I had fixed my affections upon a widow of &s;mall fortune, but one who was &s;o perfectly to my wi&s;hes, that even his commands could not force me to for&s;ake her."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were you in earne&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I was then: but at pre&s;ent I am more humble. I have implored his pardon for tho&s;e ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ions, and now only pre&s;ume by &s;up|plication to obtain his approbation of my choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is &s;he a foreigner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; an Engli&s;h woman.&mdash;We met at Flo|rence&mdash;parted at Venice&mdash;and &s;he arrived in London ju&s;t four days before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when will you introduce me to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you as much a man of gallantry as ever? If you are, you &s;hall fir&s;t promi&s;e me not to make love to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, my dear friend, you know I never make a promi&s;e when I think there is the lea&s;t probability of my breaking it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then po&s;itively you &s;hall not &s;ee my choice

till I am &s;ecure of her. But I can tell you what I'll do&mdash;I'll introduce you to my young mother-in-law, if you like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, that will do quite as well&mdash;nay, I don't know if it won't do better. Come, let us go directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! not till I have obtained my father's leave:&mdash;for, after offending him &s;o highly as not to hear from him the&s;e &s;ix months, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a letter to him as &s;oon as I arrived this morning, to beg his permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon him. And here, I &s;uppo&s;e, is his an&s;wer.</P>

&mdash;Why my father tells me he was only married this very morning! I heard he was married a week ago!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o did I&mdash;and &s;o did half the town. His marriage has even been in the new&s;papers the&s;e three days.</P>

<P>P&s;haw! my Lord: as it is the wedding day, I cannot think of taking you now: it may be improper.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, not at all. A wedding day is a public day; and Sir Adam knows upon what familiar terms you and I are. Indeed, my dear friend, my going will be con&s;idered but as neigh|bourly. I can take no denial&mdash;I mu&s;t go.</P>

<P>Well, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, come then.

Notwith&s;tanding the cau&s;e I have for rejoicing at this kind invitation from my father, &s;till I feel embarra&s;&s;ed at the thoughts of appearing before him, in the pre&s;ence of his young wife; for I have no doubt but &s;he'll take a di&s;like to me.</P>
