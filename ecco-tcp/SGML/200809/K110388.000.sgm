<P>WHILE impri&s;oned in Newgate, though thoroughly per&s;uaded I &s;hould never be tried, I yet thought it a very &s;erious duty to prepare for my Defence. It was accordingly written during my detention; and being fir&s;t ready was fir&s;t &s;ent to the pre&s;s. In point of order however it was nece&s;&s;ary to be placed the la&s;t: this is the rea&s;on that the paging recommences with the Defence. It is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to add, that it mu&s;t be read under the &s;uppo&s;ition that the trial had proceeded, the witne&s;&s;es had been heard, and that the pleadings of my coun&s;el were fini&s;hed; for under this &s;uppo&s;ition it was written.</P>

<HEAD>NARRATIVE OF FACTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the month of November, 1792, that I fir&s;t became a member of the So|ciety for Con&s;titutional Information. The multitude of great events, which at that pe|riod had happened in France, incited people of all ranks to political inquiry; and men were rou&s;ed by a perception of one of the mo&s;t palpable of truths, which yet &s;eemed as it were a recent di&s;covery, that the poli|tical in&s;titutes of all nations e&s;&s;entially in|fluence the morals and the happine&s;s of the people, and that the&s;e in&s;titutes are capable of improvement. The good was no &s;ooner perceived than an eagerne&s;s to enjoy it was begotten; and this eagerne&s;s was frequently
<PB N="2" REF="4">&s;o impatient as to excite a dread that, though it could not defeat, it might painfully retard its own purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>At length, the &s;luggi&s;h apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e men, who&s;e powers of mind are &s;mall and prejudices great, were awakened. Their numbers con&s;iderable, their wealth enor|mous, their influence univer&s;al, and their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions almo&s;t the &s;ole means to them of happine&s;s, they no &s;ooner &s;aw danger than they conceived di&s;gu&s;t for the &s;uppo&s;ed authors of it; and this di&s;gu&s;t rapidly quickened into hatred. Animo&s;ity once conceived is generally mutual; and the acrimony was di&s;tinctly &s;een to increa&s;e, and to be pregnant with pernicious effects.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it became the duty of every man to think &s;eriou&s;ly, and act with vigour. Pa&s;&s;engers in a &s;torm la|bour at the pump, are upbraided if they linger, and in danger of being thrown over|board if they refu&s;e. Individual and gene|ral &s;afety are the &s;ame, and the man who is not tru&s;ted with the helm may yet aid to heave or ca&s;t the anchor.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">Believing that all men and all actions contribute more or le&s;s to the general good or harm, I had long been accu&s;tomed, in the efforts of which I was capable, to keep that food in view. Stimulated by the con&s;idera|tions I have mentioned, and by the daily events that pre&s;&s;ed with accumulating a&s;to|ni&s;hment on the mind, I ardently applied my&s;elf to the &s;tudy of man, and the means of promoting his welfare and le&s;&s;ening his evils, as connected with political in&s;titutes. Of the rectitude of my intentions and the wi&s;dom or folly of my endeavours my fel|low citizens mu&s;t judge, by the few proofs I have been able to afford. At lea&s;t, I was a&s;&s;iduous in my inquiries; and the princi|ples in which I was con&s;irmed by them im|pelled me to communicate &s;ome part of that truth, which I imagined to be eminently beneficial.</P>
<P>The chief of the&s;e principles are, that man is happy in proportion as he is truly informed; that his ignorance is not a fault but a misfortune, becau&s;e his quantity of knowledge is inevitably the re&s;ult of
<PB N="4" REF="6">the circum&s;tances under which he exi&s;ts; that to be angry with him therefore, to treat him unkindly, and to puni&s;h him, is criminal; in other words, is erroneous; that to in&s;truct him, and while in&s;tructing to convince him of the benevolence of the teacher's intentions, is the only way to cure him of his mi&s;takes and dimini&s;h the com|mi&s;&s;ion of crimes; that, in proportion as he advances in the knowledge of facts, he will increa&s;e the means of happine&s;s; and that, as facts are unlimited in number and variety but &s;till are &s;ubject to certain un|varying laws, the increa&s;e of his happine&s;s is likewi&s;e certain, yet unlimited.</P>
<P>Being convinced that the&s;e are indubita|ble truths, I nece&s;&s;arily became the opponent of all violence, and a determined friend to the publication of truth; &s;ince by that alone the well-being of man can be promoted. Soon after I entered this Society, I was a&s;ked by an inquirer, like my&s;elf (after he had &s;tated that &s;uch &s;ocieties decide whether propo&s;itions are right or wrong by vote) whether truth depended on a majority?
<PB N="5" REF="7">whether, if a nation were unanimou&s;ly to vote that a part is greater than the whole, their deci&s;ion could alter the fact? and, if not, why did I join in the practice of error?</P>
<P>To this I replied, with &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf though not to him, that the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing facts could be affected by opi|nions was evident; but that &s;uch &s;ocieties did exi&s;t, and, till men &s;hould be better in|formed, would continue to exi&s;t; that the rule he &s;ugge&s;ted appeared to exclude all the men who were be&s;t calculated to pre|vent &s;uch &s;ocieties, in their too great ardour to do good, from doing ill; that collecting votes was a mode of e&s;timating the public opinion, a thing in it&s;elf highly de&s;irable, if it could be collected in a rational manner; and that, if I refu&s;ed to act with men &s;o long as they &s;hould be guilty of mi&s;take, I mu&s;t bani&s;h my&s;elf wholly from their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;ay then, I entered this &s;ociety with a firm determination to u&s;e every endeavour to prevent violence and acrimony, to com|municate the truth I knew or imagined I
<PB N="6" REF="8">knew, to &s;timulate others to do the &s;ame, and to interfere as little as po&s;&s;ible with the framing of propo&s;itions that were to be de|termined on by vote. Accordingly, while I remained a member, which if the &s;ociety be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;till to exi&s;t I &s;till remain, I never framed a &s;ingle re&s;olution, or excited others to the publication of any thing ex|cept of tho&s;e facts that I believed would conduce to the well-being of man. When que&s;tions were put, I &s;ometimes voted; and &s;ometimes &s;poke, to declare my opi|nion, but was much oftener &s;ilent; oc|ca&s;ionally becau&s;e I thought them frivolous, but more freuqently becau&s;e they were in my apprehen&s;ion &s;uch a mixture of right, and wrong as to leave me undecided.</P>
<P>Little did I imagine it would be po&s;&s;ible to accu&s;e the inefficient proceedings of this &s;ociety as trea&s;onable: &s;till le&s;s that I &s;hould be &s;elected, as one of the mo&s;t wicked of the&s;e con&s;piring traitors. We con&s;pired indeed, but it was to do all the good in our power; and the thing we had mo&s;t to deprecate, and of which we were weak
<PB N="7" REF="9">enough to accu&s;e our&s;elves collectively, was that our power was &s;o &s;mall.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ions of Government were fir&s;t publicly announced in the proclamation of the 21&s;t of May, 1792; and the coer|cive mea&s;ures on which it had determined immediately appeared, in parliamentary ad|dre&s;&s;es and the mea&s;ures of the magi&s;trates and municipal officers throughout the king|dom. A&s;&s;ociations were formed, and the danger of the con&s;titution, from the wicked attempts of republicans and levellers, be|came the cry of what has been called the ari&s;tocratic party. I &s;ay, what has been called; becau&s;e I am not a friend to any word with which ideas of animo&s;ity and violence &s;hall be a&s;&s;ociated. So active were the&s;e &s;elf-declared friends of Government, and &s;o loud in their a&s;&s;everations of ap|proaching ruin, the de&s;truction of property, in&s;urrection, and anarchy, that the quiet people, who erroneou&s;ly imagine they have no intere&s;t whatever in the affairs of go|vernment, that is, the greate&s;t part of the nation began to partake of the fears of the&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="10">agitators; and the deception was carried to &s;o &s;trange a height that Mini&s;try, by more proolamations, a&s;&s;erted, in the face of the world, that in&s;urrections did actually exi&s;t, which the militia was called out to quell, at a moment when not a hand or foot was &s;tirring on any &s;uch pretences within the confines of Great Britain. They &s;eemed to have reiterated the cry of fire, till they had convinced them&s;elves-that the world was in flames: and, for my own part, I have little doubt but that they were guilty of the in|credible folly of &s;uppo&s;ing that the&s;e in&s;ur|rections were really combining, and on the eve of bur&s;ting forth. That they did ac|tually exi&s;t they mu&s;t know to be a fal&s;e|hood. The mi&s;take therefore of which they were guilty was in affirming even more than they them&s;elves believed.</P>
<P>Fear and infatuation having once &s;eized the mind, its bewildered faculties run riot; and con&s;equences the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and mo&s;t deplorable are ever likely to be the re&s;ult. Pro&s;ecutions were immediately commenced, throughout the kingdom. Every county
<PB N="9" REF="11">a&s;&s;ize and quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions condemned &s;ome poor ignorant enthu&s;ia&s;t to impri&s;onment, for follies at which infancy or idioti&s;m &s;carcely could have taken fright; and men of re&s;pectable characters and hone&s;t inten|tions, in the fury of their new-born zeal, thought it a heroical act of duty to watch the conduct of their very intimates, excite them to utter what have been opprobriou&s;ly called &s;editious and trea&s;onable words, and afterward to turn informers again&s;t the in|temperance they had provoked. To avoid giving any opinion, not to mention that &s;uch &s;ilence would have been da&s;tardly and hypocritical, was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. Lan|guage the mo&s;t outrageous was employed, to make tho&s;e who were in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;|pected declare their creed; and, if it were not entirely accommodating, the peaceable citizen, after being entrapped, was in&s;ulted and turned, nay frequently kicked, out of tap-rooms, coffee-hou&s;es, and public places.</P>
<P>The impotence of the per&s;ecuted party was every where demon&s;trated; yet the outcry of alarm increa&s;ed. Church and
<PB N="10" REF="12">King mobs were proved, in public courts of ju&s;tice, to have been encouraged by the very men who&s;e office it was to keep the peace; and, at Birmingham, the deluded people who had fir&s;t been led to riot by a mi&s;taken zeal in &s;upport of Government, again ro&s;e in in&s;urrection, to avoid paying the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments which their former leaders levied on them, for the outrages they had before committed. And, for this &s;uper|induced riot, many of them have been brought to the foot of the gallows.</P>
<P>Nor was this the only occa&s;ion on which the Birmingham people followed the le&s;&s;on of anarchy they had been taught. They di&s;covered their &s;uppo&s;ed power, and ro&s;e to rid the town of all hou&s;es of ill fame. So dangerous is it to teach le&s;&s;ons of violence to well meaning but uninformed men.</P>
<P>In &s;ine, it is a fact well worthy remark that no in&s;urrection, or &s;hade of in&s;urrec|tion, has appeared on the part of the people wi&s;hing reform; and that Birmingham, Bri&s;tol, Mount-&s;treet, and Charing-cro&s;s, are all public in&s;tances of riots excited by
<PB N="11" REF="13">the mi&s;-conduct of per&s;ons who derived the authority under which they acted from Go|vernment. It may therefore be &s;oberly and truly affirmed that, if there have been trai|tors, the crime will re&s;t upon tho&s;e who have been the accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the riots of pre&s;s-gangs, &s;ailors, and coal-heavers, they originate in practices which &s;urely it is the duty of Go|vernment to inquire into, and to remedy. But they were merely repetitions of events that had but too frequently happened be|fore; and therefore could not be ju&s;tly at|tributed to the immediate interference of either party.</P>
<P>Proceeding in the &s;ame &s;pirit, printers and book&s;ellers all over the kingdom were hunted out for pro&s;ecution: and the tem|pe&s;t of in&s;urrection and anarchy was &s;o con&s;idently affirmed to be ri&s;ing, and rag|ing, that the Hou&s;e of Commons voted the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Habeas Corpus Bill, on the affirmation that dangerous and trea&s;on|able con&s;piracies did actually exi&s;t!</P>
<P>Future ages will find it difficult to be|lieve
<PB N="12" REF="14">that Government, through its agents, could conde&s;cend to u&s;e the means which were re&s;orted to, that this &s;pirit might be kept alive; and that the hatred already ge|nerated between friends, families, &s;ocieties, and &s;ects, might continue and increa&s;e. Many of its parti&s;ans openly affirmed it was de&s;irable that the conte&s;t &s;hould be brought to an i&s;&s;ue; and thou&s;ands of pamphlets were di&s;per&s;ed, gratis, all of an inflammatory kind, to produce this effect. Nay, Long Lane and Stone-cutter Street, formerly the mart for the la&s;t dying &s;peeches of malefactors, were inli&s;ted in the cau&s;e; and ballad &s;ingers were drilled, paid, and &s;tationed at the ends of &s;treets, to chaunt the downfall of the Jacobins, the glorious admini&s;tration of Mr. Pitt, and the victories of the Duke of York. If but one of them dared to &s;ing a &s;tave in favour of any thing that looked like free|dom, he or &s;he was taken up and com|mitted to the hou&s;e of correction. I my|&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed numberle&s;s &s;cenes of this kind; and, once in particular, &s;aw five
<PB N="13" REF="15">vociferous fellows, not meanly dre&s;&s;ed, with cockades in their hats, &s;houting the contents of papers meant to excite the lower people to that acrimony which, had it been completely effected as it was in part, mu&s;t have ended in mi&s;chief and horror.</P>
<P>The caricature print-fellers, too, were obliged to take their former wares from their windows; and every device, of bleed|ing heads, cannibals devouring human bo|dies, and inventions almo&s;t too dete&s;table for conception, was &s;ub&s;tituted to enrage the nation.</P>
<P>The very ballad fingers, whom I have mentioned, gave away with the halfpenny &s;ong they &s;old engravings, on copper, of the Queen of France; one of which, among many other curio&s;ities of this kind, I pur|chafed.</P>
<P>The&s;e things mu&s;t have been the work of Government. Five men could not have found it their intere&s;t &s;o to dre&s;s them&s;elves up, and proclaim through the &s;treets the
<PB N="14" REF="16">crimes and villanies of the Jacobins, and the virtues of Admini&s;tration. I walked with them as long as my time would permit, and &s;aw that it was not the &s;ale on which they depended. Long Lane never before gave copper-plate engravings, di&s;tinct from the &s;ong, with ballads which are &s;old, as I believe, for three pence the double quire.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ociety of which I was a member, it &s;eemed with the&s;e pro|gre&s;&s;ive events to increa&s;e in amazement; and I may almo&s;t &s;ay in &s;tupefaction. This was vi&s;ible in the thinne&s;s of its meetings, its inefficient efforts, and long adjourn|ments. Each man &s;aw him&s;elf the butt of obloquy. Each man knew that Mr. Reeves's a&s;&s;ociation was &s;itting, in a room of the &s;ame tavern immediately over his head; and that this a&s;&s;ociation was the focus of the opprobrium ca&s;t on them all. They &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to be watched by the very waiters. Thus hunted down, is it much to be wondered at, was it very cri|minal, that &s;ome petulant ebullitions oc|ca&s;ionally
<PB N="15" REF="17">bur&s;t forth? Was the very no|thing that they did guilt &s;o enormous? Was it high trea&s;on?</P>
<P>For my own part, when a few of its members were fir&s;t taken into cu&s;tody, I felt a&s;toni&s;hment which no words can de&s;cribe. Surely, &s;aid I, either there have been prac|tices of which I am totally ignorant, or men are running mad! Yet, in &s;pite of truth, in &s;pite of probability, the a&s;pect of the&s;e proceedings became increa&s;ingly &s;erious; and, to a man who &s;hould entertain the general tenacious love of life, terrific. The per&s;ons apprehended were &s;everally, and &s;ome of them repeatedly, examined before the Privy Council. The three e&s;tates of the kingdom had declared the exi&s;tence of trea&s;on and con&s;piracy; and the nation &s;eemed generally to credit the a&s;&s;ertion. I &s;everal times had information that a war|rant was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t me. Incredible as the rumour would have been at any other moment, I now believed it to be true.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of ab&s;olute innocence, my im|mediate conclu&s;ion was that the per&s;ons
<PB N="16" REF="18">in cu&s;tody were no traitors. Many of them I knew had been warm in di&s;cour&s;e, and did not hold the commonly &s;uppo&s;ed vi&s;ionary principles held by me, and which nece&s;&s;arily and inevitably prevent the com|mi&s;&s;ion of trea&s;on: but &s;ome of them I had frequently met, and had mixed more or le&s;s in company with mo&s;t of them, and I had never heard a whi&s;per of con|&s;piring, or of any plan for having recour&s;e to arms. Far was I from &s;uppo&s;ing that an endeavour to &s;timulate the nation to declare in favour of a parliamentary reform con|tained the &s;eeds of rebellion, and the death of the King. I heard unguarded expre&s;|&s;ions &s;ometimes, that had been provoked by actual per&s;ecution; but never a word &s;o ra&s;h as to in&s;inuate &s;uch a guilty intention. I met no man, who was &s;o void of under|&s;tanding as to &s;uppo&s;e this was the true means of promoting reform. They all knew that, if the Monarch were to die, he had an heir to &s;ucceed; and it was not the change of the King, but the change of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that, as far as I was
<PB N="17" REF="19">acquainted with their de&s;igns, had been their general object.</P>
<P>Many &s;urmi&s;es and tales prevailed, dur|ing the &s;ummer of the memorable 1794. The Reports of the Secret Committee had been read, and numbers a&s;&s;erted, with rea|&s;on, that their contents furni&s;hed no proofs to ju&s;tify the vote of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, which affirmed that a trea&s;onable con&s;piracy did exi&s;t. One week the &s;up|po&s;ed traitors were immediately to be brought to trial; the next it was &s;aid the Crown lawyers had declared that a ca&s;e of trea&s;on could not be made out, and that they would be tried for &s;editious practices. At another time the rumour was that they would not be brought to the bar, but kept in pri&s;on till the expiration of the Su&s;pen|&s;ion Act.</P>
<P>The chief emotion that I felt was &s;ome|thing of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e for which I have &s;o often been taxed as a vi&s;ionary: I mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hed I might be &s;um|moned before the Privy Council. Not to give them information of trea&s;onable prac|tices,
<PB N="18" REF="20">for I had none to give; but that I might, with a collected cool and deter|mined mind, lay before them, if I could but prevail on them to hear me, the dan|gerous con&s;equences of the mea&s;ures they were about to pur&s;ue. This wi&s;h was &s;o ardent in me that, notwith&s;tanding its ap|parent extravagance in &s;uppo&s;ing that I &s;hould be able to alter the opinions of the Privy Council, I &s;everal times mentioned it to my family and friends.</P>
<P>A warrant having been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t me, for &s;uch a warrant the me&s;&s;enger who has it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has repeatedly acknowledged was i&s;&s;ued, made it probable that I &s;hould be examined; and I had therefore pre|pared my&s;elf for the event. The late John Hunter, and other medical men, had pre|&s;cribed &s;ea-bathing for me; and, at the fir&s;t period of the report of this warrant, my affairs would have permitted me to have been ab&s;ent a &s;hort time from town. But I determined not to go, and took care to appear publicly, that it might be a&s;cer|tained I had no de&s;ire to evade inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">At length, when the affair &s;eemed almo&s;t to have &s;unk into forgetfulne&s;s, it was &s;ud|denly revived; and a commi&s;&s;ion was ap|pointed, on the till then &s;uppo&s;ed highly improbable charge of High Trea&s;on. The proceeding a&s;toni&s;hed me; but I had no &s;u&s;picion it could be intended that I &s;hould be involved in it. It is true, I had no con|ception how the per&s;ons impri&s;oned &s;hould be convicted of a trea&s;onable con&s;piracy. But they had been apprehended, had been examined, had been committed. Unac|countable rumours, indeed, had prevailed concerning me; &s;till, as I had never been called upon, never interrogated, and as my principles were, from the zeal with which I cheri&s;h and endeavour to communicate them, publicly known to &s;o many per&s;ons, I could not but imagine my&s;elf, even in the&s;e times of incredible &s;u&s;picion, an un|&s;u&s;pected man.</P>
<P>Soon however, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, a&s;&s;ertions to the contrary were &s;pread; and many &s;erious reflections &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves to my mind. Surely, &s;aid I,
<PB N="20" REF="22">this age has more general information, and therefore more virtue, more wi&s;dom, than the pa&s;t. There cannot be another meal|tub plot. No Titus Oates could now im|po&s;e his execrable fictions on mankind. Yet, what am I to think? I who, if it were not an ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e that blood would appea&s;e and purify the vicious, would willingly &s;hed my blood to teach them benevolence and truth? I who, from my heart, &s;o enthu&s;ia&s;tically de&s;ire to pro|mote good will among men; I who know too that this fact has (for I did then know that it had) been given in evidence before the Privy Council? If I can be included in an indictment for High Trea&s;on, how can I foretell what it is that cannot be? I recollected that the Hou&s;e of Commons had been led, by mini&s;try, and the adhe|rents of mini&s;try, to pa&s;s an act, a&s;&s;erting that a trea&s;onable con&s;piracy did exi&s;t; and I conceived that &s;ophi&s;try might ea&s;ily ar|gue with it&s;elf, that it were better twelve, or it may be twelve hundred, any indefi|nite number of men who were the parti|&s;ans
<PB N="21" REF="23">of reform, &s;hould die, than that the three e&s;tates of the kingdom &s;hould &s;uffer the ignominy which men might otherwi&s;e affert had been incurred. To &s;ome per&s;ons, even of the pre&s;ent day, I was well aware there would be more than plau&s;ibility in &s;uch an argument; there would be convic|tion.</P>
<P>The approaching conte&s;t I &s;aw was big with tremendous con&s;equences; and I &s;e|riou&s;ly meditated on the part it became me and every man to act. At one moment, I could not be brought to conceive my&s;elf in danger; at the next, the facts that &s;tared me in the face de&s;troyed every ground of rational calculation, and left me bewildered in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. But a fatal and a mighty blow was aimed at the very e&s;&s;ence of &s;ocial well|being, and nothing but the fortitude of the individuals accu&s;ed, and the under&s;tanding which I &s;till believed exi&s;ted in the nation, could avert the danger.</P>
<P>This narrative is a hi&s;tory of my own motives, and conduct; written in order that I may be ju&s;tified to the world, and may not
<PB N="22" REF="24">lo&s;e that utility of which the lo&s;s of the world's e&s;teem would deprive me. I there|fore in&s;ert the following letter, which will afford &s;ome &s;ketch of what my thoughts and feelings were at this awful period. It was written to my &s;on and daughter, who re&s;ide in Devon&s;hire; and, as &s;everal of their let|ters addre&s;&s;ed to me have mi&s;carried, it is not improbable that it has already been read, by the agents of mini&s;try.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends and children:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The rea&s;on of my writing to you at this moment is to prevent any unnece&s;&s;ary alarm; to which indeed I hope you would not have been very liable, even if I had not written, and if you had pre|viou&s;ly heard the &s;trange intelligence I am about to communicate through any other channel. It is a&s;&s;erted in the Morning Po&s;t of to-day, and I have before received the &s;ame information from various people, that a bill is to be pre&s;ented to the Grand Jury, containing a charge of High Trea|&s;on
<PB N="23" REF="25">again&s;t thirteen per&s;ons, of whom I am one. As it is impo&s;&s;ible that either this or any other imputed crime again&s;t the Government can be proved on me (my principles and practice having been &s;o totally oppo&s;ite to &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed crimes) I hope and mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly recommend that you will feel the &s;ame tranquillity I do. The charge is &s;o fal&s;e, and &s;o ab|&s;urd, that it has not once made my heart beat. For my own part, I feel no en|mity again&s;t tho&s;e who endeavour thus to injure me; being per&s;uaded that, in this as in all other in&s;tances, it is but the guilt of ignorance. They think they are doing their duty; I will continue to do mine, to the very utmo&s;t of my power, and on that will cheerfully re&s;t my &s;afety. I mu&s;t again conjure you both to feel neither alarm nor unea&s;ine&s;s. Remember the mo&s;t virtuous of men are liable to be mi&s;under&s;tood, and fal&s;ely accu&s;ed. But the virtuous man has no need to fear ac|cu&s;ation. If it be true that my name is in the Indictment, it will oblige me again
<PB N="24" REF="26">to defer the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you, and the hope of recruiting my health by the excur&s;ion. Of the latter it is true I have need, and to be a witne&s;s of your happi|ne&s;s would give me no &s;mall plea&s;ure: but the man of fortitude knows how to &s;ubmit to all nece&s;&s;ities; and, if he be wi&s;e, frequently to turn events which others con&s;ider as mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous to &s;ome beneficent end. Shall I own to you that, though I could not wi&s;h to be fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, yet, being &s;o accu&s;ed, I now feel an anxious de&s;ire to be heard? Let my principles and actions be inquired into, and publi&s;hed: if they have been erro|neous, let them become moral le&s;&s;ons to others; if the rever&s;e, the in&s;truction they will afford may more effectually an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e. I hope, <HI>Sophy,</HI> you know &s;omething of me: endeavour to communicate what you know to Mr. Cole, and your mutual fears will then &s;urely be very few. Ob&s;erve that, as I have yet received no notice whatever from Govern|ment, I have the above intelligence only
<PB N="25" REF="27">
from report. If it be fal&s;e, I &s;hall &s;oon be with you; if the contrary, you of cour&s;e will hear from me the moment I have any thing to communicate. Be happy, act virtuou&s;ly, and di&s;dain to live the &s;laves of fear.</P>

<P>I likewi&s;e &s;ent the following letter, on the &s;ame day, as directed; and, though it was made public on the next, it is a kind of document which I think I ought not to omit.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Editor of the Morning Po&s;t.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In your paper of ye&s;terday, my name is mentioned, among tho&s;e &s;aid to be in|&s;erted in a bill to be pre&s;ented to a Grand Jury on Thur&s;day next, containing charges of High Trea&s;on. If this be the fact, I have no wi&s;h to influence public opinion, by a previous affirmation of my own in|nocence; I de&s;ire only to appear before
<PB N="26" REF="28">my country. However, as I have not been a day ab&s;ent from home for more than twelve months, and never received from any magi&s;trate the lea&s;t intimation of any &s;u&s;picion again&s;t me, till I have official notice, my own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s obliges me to con&s;ider your intelligence as unfounded.</P>
<P>In either ca&s;e, it is a duty I owe my&s;elf to declare, that I am now and always &s;hall be ready to an&s;wer every accu&s;a|tion.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The &s;ee-&s;aw of contradictory reports con|cerning me, &s;ome affirming and &s;ome deny|ing, kept me a few days longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. A daily paper indeed a&s;&s;erted, and as it pro|fe&s;&s;ed with authority, that the rumour of my being indicted was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; and a friend, who had determined &s;hould it prove true to give me every aid in his power, quitted town the very day before the bill was returned. I was preparing to
<PB N="27" REF="29">do the &s;ame. Not only he, indeed, but all my friends as well as my&s;elf had concluded that the report would prove to be fal&s;e, it being &s;o exce&s;&s;ively improbable.</P>
<P>In this mi&s;take I remained till Monday, October 6th, at three in the afternoon; when another friend came running to in|form me that he had that moment come from Hicks's Hall, where he had been pre|&s;ent and heard an indictment for High Trea&s;on read again&s;t twelve per&s;ons, of whom I was one. I know not how to de|&s;cribe my &s;en&s;ations. I can only &s;ay, it was tho&s;e principles which I &s;o earne&s;tly recom|mended to others that pre&s;erved me from exce&s;&s;ive indignation, exce&s;&s;ive alarm, or any other pa&s;&s;ion that at &s;uch a time might have been fatal.</P>
<P>My friend felt le&s;s determined. He was a man of an acute mind, but a lawyer; and, knowing the equivocal &s;pirit of law, and the hazard incurred from the ignorance or pre|judice even of the be&s;t intentioned jurymen, he advi&s;ed immediate flight. I had no great difficulty however in convincing him, that
<PB N="28" REF="30">I had already determined on the mea&s;ures I &s;hould take.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition, he rather unwillingly left me; but he had no hope from farther argument. I then communicated the event with as much caution as po&s;&s;ible to my fa|mily. And here I had a more painful &s;cene to &s;u&s;tain. My father, in a pa&s;&s;ionate bur&s;t of tears, intreaties, and interjections, conjured me to fly. His age, and the cir|cum&s;tances under which he had lived, had rendered him a very unfit coun&s;ellor for &s;uch an occa&s;ion; and the only means I had of calming his agitated &s;pirits was by the firmne&s;s of my own behaviour, my declared re&s;olution to face my accu&s;ers, from which no power on earth &s;hould turn me, and my appeal to his own knowledge of me of how far it was po&s;&s;ible I could be thus guilty.</P>
<P>The coolne&s;s with which I acted in&s;pired my parents and children with courage. I thought it prudent however to leave them, that I might con&s;ult with my own mind, and with &s;ome friends, concerning the pro|pere&s;t mode of &s;urrendering my&s;elf; and,
<PB N="29" REF="31">learning that the court was to meet the next day at Hicks's Hall, I went to the hou&s;e of my &s;olicitor and friend Mr. Foulkes, where, with &s;ome other per&s;ons who&s;e conduct in this affair has been manly altogether, and to me in particular affectionate, I &s;upped. I did not return home, but &s;lept here.</P>
<P>The next morning I appeared in court, accompanied by my &s;olicitor and another gentleman of the law; where, as &s;oon as the bu&s;ine&s;s of the court would permit, I thus addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Eyre.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Holcroft.</HI> "My Lord, being in|formed that a bill for High Trea&s;on has been preferred again&s;t me, Thomas Holcroft, by his Maje&s;ty's Attorney General, and re|turned a true bill by a Grand Jury of the&s;e realms, I come to &s;urrender my&s;elf to this court, and my country, to be put upon my trial; that, if I am a guilty man, the whole extent of my guilt may become notorious; and, if innocent, that the rectitude of my principles and conduct may be no le&s;s pub|lic. And I hope, my Lord, there is no ap|pearance
<PB N="30" REF="32">pearance of vaunting in a&s;&s;uring your Lord|&s;hip, this court, and my country, that, after the misfortune of having been &s;u&s;pected as an enemy to the peace and happine&s;s of mankind, there is nothing on earth, after which, as an individual, I more ardently a&s;|pire than a &s;ull, fair, and public examina|tion.</P>
<P>"I have further to reque&s;t that your Lord&s;hip will inform me, if it be not the practice in the&s;e ca&s;es, to a&s;&s;ign coun&s;el, and to &s;uffer the accu&s;ed to &s;peak in his own de|fence? Likewi&s;e, whether free egre&s;s or regre&s;s be not allowed to &s;uch per&s;ons, books, and papers, as the accu&s;ed, or his coun&s;el, &s;hall deem nece&s;&s;ary for ju&s;tifi|cation?"</P>
<P><HI>Chief; Ju&s;tice.</HI> "With regard to the fir&s;t, &s;ir, it will be the duty of the court to a&s;&s;ign you coun&s;el, and al&s;o to order that &s;uch coun&s;el &s;hall have free acce&s;s to you at all proper hours. With re&s;pect, &s;ir, to the li|berty of &s;peaking for your&s;elf, the accu&s;ed will be fully heard by him&s;elf, as well as by his coun&s;el; but with regard to papers,
<PB N="31" REF="33">books, and other things of that kind, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ay any thing preci&s;ely, until the thing required be a&s;ked. How|ever, &s;ir, you may depend upon it every thing will be granted to the party accu&s;ed, &s;o as to enable him to make his defence. If I under&s;tand you rightly, you now ad|mit that you are the per&s;on &s;tanding in|dicted by the name of Thomas Holcroft."</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Holcroft.</HI> "That indeed, my Lord, is what I cannot affirm&mdash;I have it only from report."</P>
<P><HI>Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> "You come here to &s;ur|render your&s;elf; and I can only accept of that &s;urrender on the &s;uppo&s;ition that you are the per&s;on &s;o indicted. You know the con&s;equence, &s;ir, of being indicted for High Trea&s;on. I &s;hall be under the nece&s;&s;ity of ordering you into cu&s;tody. I would not wi&s;h to take any advantage of your coming forward in per&s;on, indi&s;creetly in this man|ner, without being called upon by the or|dinary proce&s;&s;es of the law. You &s;hould have a moment to con&s;ider whether you &s;urrender your&s;elf as that per&s;on."</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34"><HI>Mr. Holcroft.</HI> "It is certainly not my wi&s;h, either to inflict upon my&s;elf unnece&s;|&s;ary puni&s;hment, or to put my&s;elf in unne|ce&s;&s;ary danger. I come only as Thomas Holcroft, of Newman Street, in the county of Middle&s;ex, and I certainly do not wi&s;h to &s;tand more forward than an innocent man ought to &s;tand."</P>
<P><HI>Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> "I cannot enter into this point. If you admit your&s;elf to be the per&s;on indicted, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be, that I mu&s;t order you to be taken into cu&s;|tody to an&s;wer this charge. I do not know whether you are, or are not Thomas Hol|croft. I do not know you, and therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to know whether you are the per&s;on &s;tated in the indict|ment."</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Holcroft.</HI> "It is equally impo&s;&s;ible for me, my lord."</P>
<P><HI>Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> "Why then, &s;ir, I think you had better &s;it &s;till.&mdash;Is there any thing moved on the part of the Crown with re|&s;pect to this gentleman?"</P>
<P><HI>Solicitor General.</HI> "My lords, as I con|&s;ider
<PB N="33" REF="35">him to be the per&s;on again&s;t whom a true bill is found, I move that he be committed."</P>
<P><HI>Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> "I do not know how many per&s;ons there may be of the name of Thomas Holcroft; it would be rather ex|traordinary to commit a per&s;on on this charge, if we do not know him.</P>
<P>This produced a &s;hort con&s;ultation be|tween the Solicitor General, the other coun|&s;el for the Crown, and Mr. White. They were evidently &s;urpri&s;ed and not plea&s;ed at my appearance; and one of them, Mr. Knapp, began an argument to prove that I admitted my&s;el&s; to be the per&s;on indicted. He was interrupted by the Chief Ju&s;tice, who again a&s;ked if the coun&s;el for the Crown thought fit to move that I &s;hould be committed? which was accordingly moved, by the Solicitor General, and I was taken into cu&s;tody by a Sheriff's officer, Mr. Cawdron, of Ironmonger Lane.</P>
<P>After naming Me&s;&s;ieurs Er&s;kine and Gibbs for my coun&s;el, I a&s;ked the Bench whether a per&s;on employed to write for me
<PB N="34" REF="36">might have acce&s;s to me in pri&s;on? and this que&s;tion introduced another &s;hort dialogue.</P>
<P><HI>Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> "That is a &s;ort of thing that is quite new. I do not know that I can grant it, unle&s;s &s;omething be &s;tated by you, &s;ir, with re&s;pect to your health, to make it requi&s;ite."</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Holcroft.</HI> "That was not my mo|tive for inquiring; nor did I imagine I had demanded any thing that was not cu&s;tomary. My rea&s;on for a&s;king was that I have been u&s;ed to dictate to an amanuen&s;is; and it would be extremely convenient for me to enjoy the &s;ame advantage, while I &s;hall be preparing my defence."</P>
<P><HI>Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> "I am afraid, &s;ir, it is contrary to cu&s;tom. It will be proper for you to apply to another quarter, which can better grant &s;uch an indulgence than I can, &s;itting in this court."</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Holcroft.</HI> "My lord, I neither a&s;k nor wi&s;h for any indulgence: I only a&s;k and wi&s;h for ju&s;tice."</P>
<P><HI>Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI> "Then, &s;ir, I cannot make the order."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
After this, the Court adjourned; but I was detained perhaps three quarters of an hour: the rea&s;on of which was, as I was informed, that the warrant was making out; though I believe five minutes would have been quite &s;u&s;&s;icient for that purpo&s;e, and the truth I believe to be that the crown lawyers were con&s;ulting how I was to be treated, and &s;ending to the higher powers for in&s;tructions. The following circum&s;tances are the foundation of my belief.</P>
<P>About half pa&s;t one o'clock the &s;ame day, a per&s;on came to my hou&s;e in New|man Street, inquired if I was at home, and &s;eemed at fir&s;t unwilling to tell his bu|&s;ine&s;s; or rather was undecided; probably from not having received preci&s;e orders. He fir&s;t &s;aid he came from Mr. Munden; but, being que&s;tioned by my daughters, denied that he was the friend of Mr. Munden, and pretended that he had been with him to in|quire my place of abode. He repeatedly a&s;ked my daughters if they were &s;ure I was not at home; and they, by this time &s;u&s;pecting
<PB N="36" REF="38">him to be an officer &s;ent to take me, re|plied, he might &s;earch the hou&s;e, though he might be a&s;&s;ured I was not at home, for that I had never taught them to tell un|truths; and to prove their &s;incerity added that I was gone to the Privy Council, to &s;urrender my&s;elf. No, an&s;wered he; that he certainly is not; <HI>for I am but ju&s;t come from the Privy Council.</HI> He then &s;hewed his watch, that they might take notice it was half pa&s;t one o'clock. My daughters replied, Perhaps they were mi&s;taken; and, if &s;o, I was gone to the Old Bailey. The truth was, they knew I intended to &s;urrender my&s;elf, but did not know where.</P>
<P>He being then under&s;tood to be a me&s;|&s;enger, they a&s;ked if he intended to come in, and take my papers; for, on &s;hewing his authority, he was at liberty to make any &s;earch. He replied that, <HI>there was quite &s;ufficient without my papers;</HI> &s;peak|ing probably the language that was pre|valent, concerning the per&s;ons accu&s;ed, among the pro&s;ecutors, and their retainers;
<PB N="37" REF="39">after which he departed, &s;aying that, if I had &s;urrendered my&s;elf, it would &s;ave him trouble.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts being related to me led me to conclude that a me&s;&s;enger had been di&s;|patched from Hicks's Hall to the Privy Council; and that, to pre&s;erve the decorum of authority, this per&s;on had then been &s;ent to my hou&s;e: for the effrontery of &s;urrendering my&s;elf appears by the pro&s;e|cutors and their parti&s;ans to have been thought intolerable. But that is a que&s;tion which the reader will find di&s;cu&s;&s;ed hereaf|ter. However, while in Newgate, I &s;tated the&s;e circum&s;tances and my conjec|tures to &s;ome of the pri&s;oners; and one of the turnkeys, being pre&s;ent, &s;aid it had happened as I had &s;urmi&s;ed, and that he knew a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched from Hicks's Hall to the Privy Council on that bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>After waiting as I have &s;aid at Hicks's Hall, the warrant at la&s;t appeared, and I was attended to Newgate by the officer and one of the under &s;heriffs; both of whom
<PB N="38" REF="40">behaved with great politene&s;s to me. And here, in&s;tead of being committed to clo&s;e confinement like the other per&s;ons accu&s;ed, I was allowed the &s;ame liberty of walking the court yard and vi&s;iting my fellow pri|&s;oners which is granted to per&s;ons confined for inferior crimes. I was determined to make no application for the &s;um of thirteen and four pence per week, which was al|lowed to the per&s;ons who had been impri|&s;oned in the Tower; and accordingly I received the common pri&s;on allowance of the per&s;ons confined for &s;edition and mi&s;de|meanor, which is three halfpenny worth of bread per day, and no more. I do not at|tribute this to any de&s;ire in the pro&s;ecutors to treat me with additional &s;everity, for they had demon&s;trated the contrary; but as a trait to &s;hew how negligent tho&s;e who puni&s;h are of the attention that is always due to people puni&s;hed; and whom, with|out intending additional injury, they might and I believe frequently do leave to peri&s;h. I &s;tate this as one of the inevitable evils of a &s;y&s;tem of puni&s;hment; and common
<PB N="39" REF="41">to all countries, though perhaps better guarded againt in this than in many.</P>
<P>Locked within the walls of Newgate, I had full lei&s;ure for meditation; and my thoughts were inten&s;ely fixed on the &s;tate of the kingdom, on the prejudices that mu&s;t be prevalent or &s;uch proceedings could not have taken place, and in conjectures on what might be the actual degree of error to which the per&s;ons who in&s;tigated this pro|&s;ecution might be &s;ubject. The pro&s;pect &s;eemed big with danger to the peace and freedom of mankind, and the only rational mode of averting it was a cool yet active fortitude. To defend my&s;elf by &s;hewing the fal&s;ehood of the accu&s;ation was a duty; but it was a duty which at this moment I knew not how to di&s;charge: I had no do|cuments, nor could I tell of what I was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>I had remained in this &s;u&s;pen&s;e a few days when Mr. Kirby the keeper of New|gate one morning came, de&s;ired me to fol|low him, and led me through the other|wi&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="42">impa&s;&s;able gates to an apartment in his own hou&s;e. Here I was introduced to Mr. White, the Solicitor for the Trea&s;ury, and his two clerks; and he pre&s;ented me with the indictment, a li&s;t of witne&s;&s;es, and another li&s;t of the jurymen &s;ummoned for the&s;e trials; informing me at the &s;ame time that the Crown would grant as many &s;ubpoenas, without expence, as I &s;hould think proper to demand. He a&s;&s;umed great politene&s;s, and I may &s;ay amenity; and I have no doubt but, at that moment, he felt as he looked; yet I could not forget the public and common a&s;&s;ertion, that Mr. White has been rapidly making a fortune by the pro&s;ecutions which Government within the&s;e three years has undertaken, and which it is &s;aid he has promoted with uncommon a&s;&s;iduity and zeal. I have no doubt but that all pro&s;ecutors per&s;uade them&s;elves they are acting rightly. I am only &s;orry that they cannot detect the mo|tives by which they are too frequently fri|mulated. I received the death-dealing in|&s;trument
<PB N="41" REF="43">he pre&s;ented, bowed, withdrew, and was re-conducted to my place of con|finement.</P>
<P>My ardour to examine the charges brought again&s;t me, the li&s;t of the witne&s;&s;es who were my accu&s;ers, and the names of the men by &s;ome of whom I was to be tried, may well be imagined; but not the a&s;toni&s;hment I felt, after &s;crutinizing the contents. I was indicted with eleven other per&s;ons in the &s;ame bill. That is, becau&s;e I had a&s;&s;ociated with &s;ome men, in the mo&s;t orderly manner, and with the mo&s;t peaceful intentions to produce what we believed would be bencficial to man|kind, I was charged with the &s;uppo&s;ed (for they were not real) crimes of the&s;e men, when or wherever they had been committed, though totally without my participation or knowledge! There was not a &s;peci&s;ic &s;tatement of any action of mine; but affirmations concerning the col|lective actions of twelve men, together with other unknown con&s;pirators, which, re&s;pecting my&s;elf at lea&s;t, I knew to be to|tally
<PB N="42" REF="44">and without exception fal&s;e. But I will forbear to dwell on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I &s;hall in&s;ert the paper which it was my in|tention to have read and pre&s;ented to the court, on the day of my arraignment, as a prote&s;t again&s;t this whole proceeding. In the mean time, I drew up a plan of the manner in which, if my coun&s;el &s;hould agree in opinion with me, I &s;hould wi&s;h to have my defence conducted. It was as follows:</P>

<P>At length, the pri&s;oners who&s;e names were in one indictment were brought from the Tower; and we heard that we were to be arraigned on Saturday October the 25th. In the mean time, I had &s;ent the prote&s;t which I intended to read and deliver to the Court to my coun&s;el; and they, returned a me&s;&s;age, entreating me, as I re&s;pected the lives of other men, to forbear. They were too deeply engaged to come them&s;elves, for they had indeed incredible fatigues to &s;u&s;tain, and I therefore was ignorant of their rea&s;ons; though, for my own part, I could not nor can I &s;ee how this paper would have been dangerous to any man. However, the ar|gument they urged was of &s;uch moment that I ceded without being convinced; which I con&s;ider as an error. The paper was as follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="46" REF="48">
<TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="protest">
<HEAD>PROTEST <HI>Again&s;t the</HI> INDICTMENT <HI>and</HI> LIST <HI>of</HI> WITNESSES.</HEAD>
<P>I conceive that the Indictment is mo&s;t unju&s;t, and flagitious. It combines hetero|geneous actions, meetings, accu&s;ations, and per&s;ons, that ought all to have been kept free from confu&s;ion. I make this remark becau&s;e it is my duty; without intending any the mo&s;t minute &s;hade of cen&s;ure on my fellow &s;ufferers. Indeed, the conduct of no two individuals ever was or ever can be the &s;ame; they therefore ought not to be con|founded. Every po&s;&s;ible means of avoid|ing error &s;hould be con&s;cientiou&s;ly, &s;crupu|lou&s;ly and minutely avoided; more parti|cularly by tho&s;e who pro&s;ecute in order to inflict puni&s;hment, and that puni&s;hment being no le&s;s than the lo&s;s, of life. To pro|te&s;t again&s;t &s;uch conduct in pro&s;ecutors is the duty, not only of the pro&s;ecuted, but, of every human being. Precedents &s;o de|&s;tructive to every man living, and to all fu|ture
<PB N="47" REF="49">men, while men &s;hall continue to act as they erroneou&s;ly do at pre&s;ent from pre|cedent, ought not to be left upon record. I doubt whether every virtuous man ought not rather to &s;uffer death than to plead to &s;uch an indictment.</P>
<P>To me the confu&s;ion is inexplicable; and, of all fatal means to involve innocence, this is among the mo&s;t fatal. A promi&s;|cuous li&s;t of two hundred and eight wit|ne&s;&s;es is given me, nine-tenths of whom are utter &s;trangers to me, in per&s;on, abode, and even name; and of the whole not one has, to my knowledge, any po&s;&s;ible charge of guilt to bring again&s;t me. Yet I am le&s;t to conjecture, if I can, who are my accu&s;ers; or of what they can accu&s;e me. I &s;ay, I may conjecture, if I can; but I cannot: I have no guide. No duty can be more facred than that of declaring to a man who&s;e life is put in jeopardy by accu&s;ation, and as he him&s;elf well knows by fai&s;e accu&s;ation or it could not have been in jeopardy; I &s;ay, no duty can be more &s;acred than that of in|forming him who are his accu&s;ers. He is,
<PB N="48" REF="50">afloat on the &s;ea of pro&s;ecution; and his pro&s;ecutors, who lay claim to pure unde|viating ju&s;tice, have taken means which they cannot but know are the mo&s;t certain to hara&s;s and bewilder him, and by which in de&s;pite of innocence he may finally peri&s;h. Such is individually the &s;ituation of every man arraigned under this confu&s;ed, inex|plicable, and unju&s;t indictment. I there|fore prote&s;t again&s;t its iniquity, and appeal to ju&s;tice: not becau&s;e I have any fears for my&s;elf, but becau&s;e I would not without appeal leave &s;uch a pernicious in&s;trument on record.</P>

<P>The Tue&s;day following the trials began; and perhaps this country never witne&s;&s;ed a moment more portentous. The hearts and countenances of men &s;eemed pregnant with doubt and terror. They waited, in &s;ome|thing like a &s;tupor of amazement, for the fearful &s;entence on which their deliverance or their de&s;truction &s;eemed to depend. Never &s;urely was the public mind more profoundly agitated. The whole power
<PB N="49" REF="51">of Government was directed again&s;t Thomas Hardy; in his fate &s;eemed involved the fate of the nation, and the verdict of Not Guilty appeared to have bur&s;t its bonds, and to have relea&s;ed it from inconceivable mi&s;eries, and ages of impending &s;lavery. The acclama|tions of the Old Bailey reverberated from the farthe&s;t &s;hores of Scotland, and the whole people felt the enthu&s;ia&s;tic tran&s;ports of recovered freedom.</P>
<P>For my own part, though few men par|ticipated more amply in the general joy than I did, I can truly &s;ay it was not be|cau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf a party. It was a conviction which I could never work upon my&s;elf that my accu&s;ers ever had any inten|tion of producing evidence again&s;t me. Yet I knew how dangerous it would be &s;hould I be deceived, and found unprepared. I therefore laboured with the &s;ame ardour, at my de|fence, as if I had been really per&s;uaded I &s;hould be brought to trial; and the belief that I &s;hould not was the only thought that gave me pain. To be thus publicly ac|cu&s;ed and not as publicly heard, to have it
<PB N="50" REF="52">&s;uppo&s;ed through the kingdom that I was involved in all the guilt which they had imputed to other men (but could not prove) that is, in tran&s;actions of which I had never heard till the reports of the Secret Com|mittee were publi&s;hed, and in which I had no concern whatever direct or indirect, this I own was an evil which I would have given my right hand to have avoided. But I too plainly fore&s;aw, what afterward happened, that I was not to be heard. I hoped that &s;o much re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, would have been paid to ju&s;tice as that I &s;hould have been permitted to &s;tate a few facts, in the open court, concerning my&s;elf; by which means they would have be&s;t been circulated through the kingdom. For this purpo&s;e, and that I might well weigh my a&s;&s;ertions, and not make my&s;elf liable to the mi&s;takes either of memory or of erroneous feeling, that is, not more liable than I am in my coole&s;t moments, I arranged my thoughts and committed them to paper. The following is the addre&s;s I intended to have delivered, at the bar of the Old Bailey,
<PB N="51" REF="53">on the morning when the Jury were di|rected to acquit me; the Attorney General having declared his intention of not calling any witne&s;&s;es, to prove the trea&s;on charged again&s;t me and three other per&s;ons in the indictment.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Gentlemen of the Jury,</P>
<P>Before I quit this place, I think my&s;elf obliged, by the mo&s;t &s;acred of duties, to &s;ay a few words to you. I will not long intrude upon your time; but a wi&s;h to de|ter men from error and mi&s;chief, by a &s;im|ple &s;tatement of facts, will not &s;uffer me to depart in total &s;ilence. Let me however preface what I have to &s;ay, by a &s;olemn declaration that, as far as I am acquainted with my own motives, I am not &s;timulated, however great may have been the inju&s;tice I have &s;uffered, by any &s;entiments of ven|geance or de&s;ire of retaliation.</P>
<P>You are directed, Gentlemen, to acquit me. This was an event which I have con|tinually foretold. It could not be other|wi&s;e; unle&s;s methods had been practi&s;ed
<PB N="52" REF="54">too flagrant even for the mi&s;taken men, who have brought me and &s;o many others into the pre&s;ent horrid predicament; that of having our own lives, and the liberties of the nation, expo&s;ed to the de&s;perate ha|zard of being contended for, by the errors, pa&s;&s;ions, and prejudices of men. This ac|quittal without an examination, though long fore&s;een, was the thing I had mo&s;t to dread. Gentlemen, notwith&s;tanding you now cannot but feel why our pro&s;ecutors do not bring us to trial, you will yet per|haps find &s;ome difficulty in believing the facts I am about to &s;tate relative to my&s;elf. The principal of the&s;e facts is that my pro|&s;ecutors knew that, in&s;tead of being a traitor, a mover of war and in&s;urrection, and a killer of kings, I &s;ay, they had proof that I was a man who&s;e principles and practice were the very rever&s;e. Evi|dence was given before the Privy Council, of the&s;e facts: and they had no evidence whatever, nor the &s;lighte&s;t &s;hadow of evi|dence, that I was a perturbator of the public peace. You need not be told, Gentlemen,
<PB N="53" REF="55">that it is the general opinion of mankind that force can be no way effectually repel|led but by force. This, though the gene|ral opinion of mankind, is not my opinion: and my pro&s;ecutors had evidence that it is not my opinion. They had evidence that, in the Con&s;titutional Society of which I am a member, and under pretence of which they have indicted me for High Trea&s;on, I was theoretically the adver&s;ary of all force, in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es; and that prac|tically I concurred, with the members who were mo&s;t de&s;irous of promoting reform, in urging that it mu&s;t be done by the peace|able means of per&s;ua&s;ion; by the convic|tion of the under&s;tanding; and not by the force of arms; not by Tower mu&s;kets; not by Sheffield pikes; not by bread and chee&s;e knives.&mdash;Of &s;uch weapons, Gentle|men, I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, and may my memory be execrated by all good men, to all po&s;terity, if I &s;peak with the lea&s;t equivocation or mental re&s;erve! I &s;ay, Gentlemen, I do thus mo&s;t &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, that I never either heard &s;uch wicked
<PB N="54" REF="56">means of compul&s;ion propo&s;ed, or that &s;uch things were in exi&s;tence; except in the avowed and public way in which all men know that knives and mu&s;kets do exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the principal witne&s;s exa|mined concerning me before the Privy Council was Mr. Sharp, the engraver: a man who&s;e te&s;timony has already been &s;o amply detailed, in the late trial before this Court, as a witne&s;s for the Crown, and of who&s;e integrity there is no &s;hadow of doubt. Knowing that he had been exa|mined, I wrote to him on Saturday la&s;t, to reque&s;t he would &s;tate under his own hand what his examination had been, re&s;pecting me. This is his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>'<HI>Copy from my Te&s;timony which I &s;igned at the Privy Council.</HI>'</P>
<Q>The Society for Con&s;titutional Infor|mation adjourned, and left the delegates in the room. The mo&s;t gentleman-like per&s;on (of the Corre&s;ponding Society) took the chair, and talked about an equal
<PB N="55" REF="57">repre&s;entation of the people, and of put|ting and end to war. Holcroft talked about
the Powers of the Human Mind.</Q>
<Q><P>This is the whole that I &s;igned&mdash;The particulars that I remember, of that con|ver&s;ation [before the Privy Council] are I believe nearly as follow. Mr. Holcroft talked a great deal about Peace; of his being again&s;t any violent or coercive means, that were u&s;ually re&s;orted to again&s;t our Fellow Creatures; urged the more powerful operation of Philo&s;ophy and Rea&s;on, to convince man of his errors; that he would di&s;arm his greate&s;t enemy by tho&s;e means, and oppo&s;e his fury&mdash; Spoke al&s;o about <HI>Truth</HI> being powerful; &amp;c, &amp;c; and gave advice to the above effect to the delegates pre&s;ent, who <HI>all</HI> &s;eemed to agree as no per&s;on oppo&s;ed his arguments. This conver&s;ation la&s;ted <HI>bet|ter than an hour,</HI> and we departed. The next time the delegates met, Holcroft was <HI>not</HI> pre&s;ent. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of 'what I remember of that conver&s;ation.</P></Q></Q>
<P>Mr. Sharp was again examined, before
<PB N="56" REF="58">the Grand Jury; and this is what he writes.</P>
<Q>Before the Grand Jury, I mentioned Mr. Holcroft's di&s;po&s;ition and conver&s;a|tion, when we met, about rea&s;oning men out of their errors, who was a &s;ort of natural Quaker, and was for the peaceable means that philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on point out to <HI>convince</HI> mankind. He was <HI>again&s;t violence of all kinds;</HI> but did not believe in the &s;ecret impul&s;es of the &s;pirit, like the Quakers.</Q>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Mr. Symmonds, another witne&s;s for the Crown, gave po&s;itive and pointed evidence before the Privy Council to the very active part I took when it was propo&s;ed to call a Convention, in prevailing on the Society for Con&s;titutional Information to change the word Convention for the word Meeting. This I urged, and this Mr. Horne Tooke and the whole &s;ociety agreed to, with the expre&s;s and declared purpo&s;e of preventing mi&s;interpretation; and of proving even by the choice of a word that, &s;o far from wi&s;hing to terrify, we were anxious to
<PB N="57" REF="59">convince all mankind that our plans and intentions were wholly peaceable.</P>
<P>Whether Mr. Adams, the Secretary, were or were not examined concerning me I do not know. If he were not, let the men who have in&s;tituted the&s;e inquiries and this pro&s;ecution account for &s;uch re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s, if they can: and, if he were, I am certain what the nature of his te&s;timony mu&s;t be. His brother, whom I &s;aw ye&s;|terday, informed me that he had &s;everal times heard Mr. Adams declare his utter a&s;toni&s;hment that I, in particular, could be indicted: becau&s;e of the repeated and ar|dent manner in which he and every body had heard me declare my &s;entiments, in fa|vour of peace and non-re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts, Gentlemen, are known to all the members of the Con&s;titutional So|ciety; and, had I been tried, I &s;hould have brought numerous and highly re&s;pectable per&s;ons of all parties to depo&s;e to their truth.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have &s;tated the&s;e facts to you becau&s;e they &s;eem to me &s;o awful, &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="60">pernicious, &s;o alarming to the liberties of the nation, and to have been conceived and executed with &s;uch unexampled acrimony and violence, that, &s;hould they be &s;uffered to pa&s;s in &s;ilence and unexamined, every man among us will be guilty of unpardon|able neglect.</P>
<P>Ra&s;h as in my opinion the proceedings of Government have been, yet &s;urely they never would have been ra&s;h to this extreme, had it not been taken for granted that, &s;ee|ing my&s;elf threatened by power &s;o formi|dable and as at that moment it appeared &s;o unlimited, I &s;hould not have dared, how|ever con&s;cious of my own innocence, to abide the dangerous i&s;&s;ue. Either they concluded that I &s;hould have fled, and that my terror would have given &s;ome &s;anction to their tyranny (I hope, Gentlemen, I do not call it by too har&s;h a name)&mdash;either they thought them&s;elves certain of this, or I own to me their actions are totally in|comprehen&s;ible. That they calculated deeply on con&s;tructive trea&s;on the late trials have now rendered as vi&s;ible as the
<PB N="59" REF="61">noon day &s;un. But that they could ima|gine any Jury could &s;ee a man brought be|fore them, of who&s;e peaceable principles and conduct the pro&s;ecutors had the proof that I have cited, and not feel indignation inexpre&s;&s;ible, is folly too great to be attri|buted even to the&s;e infatuated governors of twelve millions of men.</P>
<P>Remember, Gentlemen, into what a &s;i|tuation their own temerity had brought them. The honour of Parliament, the ve|racity of the Secret Committee, and per|haps the exi&s;tence of the Mini&s;try, de|pended on proving that no fal&s;ehood had been voted, on that memorable occa&s;ion when the whole Legi&s;lature decreed that a dangerous con&s;piracy did exi&s;t in this kingdom. Woe be to the kingdom where the Mini&s;try can lead the Legi&s;lature thus to decree, thus to prejudge, thus to en|danger the lives and liberties of milli|ons, and can be &s;uffered to enjoy the means of repeating &s;uch unju&s;t and por|tentous decrees! I do not mean, Gentle|men, that I would have them puni&s;hed.
<PB N="60" REF="62">I have not a wi&s;h to do by them as they have &s;trained every nerve to do by a few feeble individuals. I am as much an enemy to halters and axes as I am to mu&s;kets and pikes; but I am likewi&s;e an enemy to the entru&s;ting of &s;uch men with power. That is the full and whole extent of my meaning.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, thus far I have endeavoured to call your attention to this affair only as it concerns the public at large; at pre&s;ent I think it incumbent on me to &s;ay a few words concerning my&s;elf. Every man is virtuous in proportion to his utility in &s;o|ciety; and, however little men in general are aware of the important truth, his public utility and his private happine&s;s are in&s;e|parable. Whoever therefore intrenches upon the utility of an individual at once offends again&s;t both public and private good. The injury that has been committed on my pri|vate concerns and public utility, by the pro|ceedings of Government, and the creatures of Government, before and during this pro|&s;ecution, are &s;uch as I only can thoroughly
<PB N="61" REF="63">know and feel. My fame, my fortune, and my family, beings who have none but me for their protection and &s;upport, have all deeply &s;uffered. I come not here to complain, but to &s;tate facts. Ju&s;tice, though it regards the whole, concerns it&s;elf in this place only with individuals. Remunera|tion for the injury I have &s;u&s;tained is, in my ca&s;e, out of the que&s;tion: my pro&s;ecu|tors cannot call back time. They can re|ver&s;e attainders; but they cannot rever&s;e the mi&s;chiefs they have done. Wrongs committed again&s;t one man are committed again&s;t all, and not to make them known is a breach of public duty. I do not unwor|thily &s;eek to excite compa&s;&s;ion, or obtain a recompence. The fir&s;t I think a vice, and the &s;econd an impo&s;&s;ibility. Our time ought to be actively employed in the re|moving, and not wa&s;ted in the pitying, of evil: and inju&s;tice has no price, therefore cannot be compen&s;ated. But the errors of men ought to be proclaimed that they may be avoided; and with this intention I pro|ceed.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">
Five months previous to the indictment, it was publicly known that a warrant was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t me, and hanging over my head, whenever they &s;hould think proper to have it &s;erved. The nation through the mini&s;terial prints was taught to con&s;ider me as &s;omething wor&s;e than a &s;u&s;pected per&s;on. The timid &s;hunned me, the moderate re|garded me with an evil eye, and the violent never mentioned me but with virulence and odium. I courted no party, and there|fore had no protectors. My peace of mind indeed was invulnerable; for it was &s;hielded by con&s;cious rectitude of intention: but my re&s;ources were narrowed; and I &s;uffered evils which, though I con&s;ider as tri&s;ling, I find the world around me complaining of as among the bittere&s;t that man can bear. Hitherto, however, I had been only idly per&s;ecuted by the &s;en&s;ele&s;s buzz of Calumny: the moment arrived when I was to meet her in a more &s;erious form. Mr. Attorney General became her organ; and this grave court, this learned nation, this enlightened age, were informed that I was a con&s;pirator,
<PB N="63" REF="65">a traitor, a mover of war and in&s;urrection, and a depo&s;er of Kings! and, that they might rationally account for all this, that I was in&s;tigated by the Devil! It was well indeed that they gave me the Devil for a co-adjutor, or the charge would have been too ridiculous. For my own part, however, I defy Mr. Attorney General, armed with all his Con&s;tructive Trea&s;ons, which in the &s;ame breath he has abjured and employed; I defy him, aided by Con&s;tructive Trea&s;on it&s;elf, to prove that I have compa&s;&s;ed or imagined the death of the King.</P>
<P>This &s;trange charge, Gentlemen, has brought upon me the con&s;equences I have &s;tated. Torn from my family, my literary labours &s;u&s;pended, my body impri&s;oned, my life threatened, and every exertion called forth le&s;t it &s;hould be lo&s;t by fal&s;e accu&s;a|tion, my u&s;ual re&s;ources of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence were in&s;tantly &s;wept away: for I have no re|&s;ources, nor ever have had, nor ever wi&s;h to have, but in my labours.</P>
<P>The moment when, by the operation of the indictment found again&s;t me, the evils I
<PB N="64" REF="66">have &s;tated befel me, was the mo&s;t fatal that in my ca&s;e could have happened. It was when I had two pre&s;&s;ing works to engage in and complete, for the &s;ea&s;on of exhibi|tion and publication. This &s;ea&s;on is come, I am wholly unprepared, my time mu&s;t &s;till be engro&s;&s;ed by endeavours to wipe away the a&s;per&s;ions that have been ca&s;t on my character, and the means of &s;upport for my family for I know not how long are gone.</P>
<P>To the&s;e evils are added the law expences of this pro&s;ecution: and think, Gentlemen, what tho&s;e mu&s;t be, where two li&s;ts were given me, of Jurors and Witne&s;&s;es, amount|ing to four hundred and thirty-&s;ix per&s;ons; who&s;e characters, pa&s;&s;ions, and prejudices, the Solicitor and Coun&s;el for the defence had to examine, through channels the mo&s;t numerous and intricate, before they could be &s;atisfied that the lives of the accu&s;ed might not fall the &s;acrifices of mi&s;take or perjury. I and my fellow &s;ufferers were not wallowing in affluence; we could not give 84001. to our coun&s;el with their briefs; nor expend thou&s;ands and hundreds of
<PB N="65" REF="67">thou&s;ands in our defence. We had no na|tional trea&s;ury to draw upon. Alas! we had the wealth of the nation, the prejudices of the nation, and the power of the nation to encounter. By what miracle could we e&s;cape? The innocence of tho&s;e men mu&s;t be evident indeed that could endure &s;uch an inque&s;t, and with&s;tand &s;uch an a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Oh! how cautious ought tho&s;e to be, who&s;e accu&s;ation is in&s;tantly followed by impri&s;onment, and all the angui&s;h which the threatened lo&s;s of property, character, and life occa&s;ion! how &s;evere &s;hould be their inquiries into facts! how con&s;cientious the inferences they draw, when con&s;equences &s;o &s;erious and fatal are inevitably to re&s;ult! Gentlemen, in an affair thus tre|mendous, a&s;k your&s;elves, what would your feelings be? what your fears? how would you tremble, le&s;t you &s;hould be guilty of fal&s;e accu&s;ation! how would you interro|gate, and repeat interrogation in a thou&s;and different modes; even when que&s;tioning the mo&s;t unprejudiced, the mo&s;t open, the mo&s;t hone&s;t witne&s;s! What then would
<PB N="66" REF="68">you do with a Spy and an Informer? a man whom you had taken into pay, and who mu&s;t accu&s;e, or mu&s;t demon&s;trate that his o&s;&s;ice is u&s;ele&s;s? a trained and hired per|jurer?</P>
<P>Yes; indictments preferred on &s;uch evi|dence are indeed flagitious! But what mu&s;t have been the motives of tho&s;e pro&s;ecutors who could employ &s;uch wicked engines? per&s;ons who could &s;o far forget all &s;em|blance of ju&s;tice as to bring the&s;e accumu|lated wrongs on a man, again&s;t whom they not only were de&s;titute of all proof of guilt, but had the actual proofs that you have heard of his innocence? nay, let me ho|ne&s;tly &s;ay, of his virtue?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have &s;tated &s;ome of the misfortunes brought upon me by this mo&s;t groundle&s;s accu&s;ation. How far they are hereafter to pur&s;ue me and my family, my daughters who have yet a provi&s;ion to &s;eek, my aged parents who have no &s;upport but from my labours, of all this I am ignorant. But I &s;hall &s;uffer chearfully, and misfortune
<PB N="67" REF="69">it&s;elf will turn to ble&s;&s;ing, if I can but lead you and all men to reflect on the nature of &s;uch ca&s;es. Con&s;ider them well. Being injured by Government, of whom are we to &s;eek relief? If a man, thinking Govern|ment culpable, endeavour to correct its vices, and accu&s;e it, no matter how truly, what is the peril he incurs? Infamy, de&s;truction, death, with incredible barbarity. If Go|vernment, &s;u&s;pecting a man to be culpable, accu&s;e him, no matter how fal&s;ely, not with an intent to correct his vices, but to wreak vengeance, con&s;ign to ignominy, and hang draw and quarter, what redre&s;s has the poor trembling hunted wretch, &s;hould he happen to e&s;cape its &s;anguinary fangs? None. Who knows not the de&s;tructive nature of &s;uits at law? and where is the in|dividual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wealth enough to main|tain a &s;uit again&s;t the Trea&s;ury? Of whom then is the ruined father and the de&s;titute family to &s;eek ju&s;tice? His character bla&s;ted, his means con&s;umed, his labour impeded, his days &s;pent in the torments of uncer|tainty,
<PB N="68" REF="70">his nights in the terrors which im|po&s;&s;ible endeavours to forget the&s;e torments cau&s;e, to whom is he to complain?</P>
<P>Should he, on the contrary, be a man whom oppre&s;&s;ion cannot &s;hake, &s;uffering make wretched, nor horrors appal; who&s;e well dige&s;ted principles render him calm in adver&s;ity, chearful under opprobrium, dauntle&s;s however menaced, &s;tedfa&s;t though the red right arm of power and per&s;ecution &s;trike him; a man determined in right, unrevengeful of wrong, and making his own happine&s;s but incidental to the happi|ne&s;s of the whole; &s;uch a man, though he will &s;eek ju&s;tice for him&s;elf becau&s;e it is a duty, yet, &s;hould it be denied him, will bear injuries with fortitude, and private misfor|tunes without a murmur. Happy is it for him, that he is capable of this equanimity. But what is the guilt of that Government which can tear him from his benevolent pur&s;uits, endanger his exi&s;tence, and, if it fail in the completion of its evil de&s;igns, yet abbreviate and half cut off the powers
<PB N="69" REF="71">which he had been all his life toiling to at|tain, only that he might employ them for the good of his fellow men; his brothers, among whom he numbers his very per&s;e|cutors them&s;elves?</P></Q>
<P>This was the addre&s;s which I was pre|pared to have &s;poken; and which act of exculpatory ju&s;tice I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected, as it happened, would be denied me. I was committed to Newgate on the 7th of Oc|tober; where I remained eight weeks, within a day. On Saturday November the 29th I received the following notice:</P>

<P>Mr. Solicitor White did not come him|&s;elf to deliver this paper; nor was the morning the time cho&s;en for its delivery; it was after the hour of locking up, which is nine o'clock. That is, whether &s;o con|trived or not, it was after the hour that I could either &s;end to inform my friends, or write to communicate the intelligence to the country; and, Sunday being no po&s;t-day, it was by this means concealed as long as po&s;&s;ible. I do not know that this had any meaning; but &s;uch petty circum&s;tances, that look like art, have &s;o frequently come under my ob&s;ervation that, if they were all
<PB N="71" REF="73">unintentional, the coincidence at lea&s;t has been remarkable.</P>
<P>On Monday December I&s;t Mr. Bonney, Mr. Kyd, Mr. Joyce, and I were put to the bar; and, in the language of the court, honourably acquitted. The other gentle|men, bowed, and retired. I attempted to &s;peak, and the attempt produced the fol|lowing dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Holcroft&mdash;You have been acquitted in a way that hardly affords much room for your ob&s;ervation&mdash;I think the be&s;t way would be for you to follow the example of the re&s;t of the Gentle|men, who have retired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord&mdash;Every man mu&s;t act according to the be&s;t of his own judgment. My judgment tells me that it is my duty, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to ad|dre&s;s a few words to this court and the gen|tlemen of the jury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will under&s;tand one thing; and that is, that, having been ac|quitted,
<PB N="72" REF="74">you have <HI>no right</HI> to addre&s;s one word, either to the court or the jury.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, I don't wi&s;h to hold you &s;trictly to that right; but conduct your|&s;elf properly, and I won't &s;top you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord&mdash;I have well con&s;idered what I have to &s;ay. Whether my judgment and the judgment of your Lord&s;hip &s;hould happen to differ, it is impo&s;|&s;ible for me to foreknow; but what I have to &s;ay flows from the dictates, I believe, of an hone&s;t and well intentioned mind. I am liable like all other men to mi&s;take. Let my mi&s;takes be heard and examined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e dictates mu&s;t be properly timed&mdash;At pre&s;ent, you are not called upon to &s;ay any thing; and you have no right to detain the court by a long &s;peech.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not detain the court more than half an hour.</P>
</SP>

<P>Half an hour!&mdash;Mr. Hol|croft, you mu&s;t withdraw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>After having &s;uffered the inju&s;tice that I think I have &s;uffered, and
<PB N="73" REF="75">which inju&s;tice it is my de&s;ire to &s;tate here publicly to this court&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Ju&s;lice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Holcroft&mdash;You have been dealt with <HI>mo&s;t honourably,</HI> on the part of the Attorney General. You &s;tood indicted by your Country; and no man, who happens &s;o &s;tand in that &s;ituation, ought to complain of inju&s;tice; becau&s;e <HI>he accu&s;es his country of inju&s;tice,</HI> when he makes that complaint. You have had no extraordinary hard&s;hips. You brought your&s;elf into cu&s;tody, by your own volun|tary &s;urrender. You have had no extra|ordinary hard&s;hip; &s;ince that time; and you have in the clo&s;e of it been treated mo&s;t honourably, and with all po&s;&s;ible attention, by the Attorney General, who has con|&s;ented to your being acquitted, in&s;tead of &s;tanding at the Bar upon evidence; which mu&s;t have been left to the jury as evidence proper for their con&s;ideration, upon the que&s;tion whether you were to be found guilty or not guilty. You have no right to complain of inju&s;tice; and therefore
<PB N="74" REF="76">you ought not to be heard, upon a com|plaint of inju&s;tice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I de&s;ire but one word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baron Hotham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Kirby, why don't you do your duty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, permit me to &s;ay one word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will be rea&s;onable, and confine your&s;elf within compa&s;s, I will not &s;top you; but a &s;peech of half an hour is not a thing to be endured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find the judgment of the court wi&s;hes me to with draw&mdash;I always de|&s;ire to comport my&s;elf &s;o as to gain be&s;t the good opinion of mankind by the exer|tion of what I think to be my duty. If my judgment happens to be mi&s;taken, if I am wrong in this in&s;tance, I am certainly &s;orry I have not more under&s;tanding. I do not wi&s;h either to appear a violent man or an ob&s;tinate man&mdash;I had &s;omething to &s;ay to this court which I think of the utmo&s;t importance to my country and mankind in
<PB N="75" REF="77">general, and therefore I wi&s;hed for a moment to be heard; but as it does appear to be the opinion of this Court and every body here, I mu&s;t accede to that public opinion in this place, and mu&s;t take &s;ome other means of publi&s;hing my &s;entiments upon the pro&s;ecution that has been in&s;tituted again&s;t me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had better take care of that, or you may get into <HI>another &s;crape</HI> as &s;oon as you are relieved <HI>from this.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Holcroft.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord&mdash;I am very willing to &s;uffer for what I conceive to be right.</P>
</SP>
<P>The above dialogue is printed from notes, taken in &s;hort hand by Mr. Ram&s;ey: after it was over I with drew.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e my narrative, I mu&s;t &s;tate two particulars; which I forgot to in&s;ert in their proper places. The fir&s;t is that I &s;ent to my Coun&s;el and Solicitor, with the plan of the defence that I wi&s;hed &s;hould be made for me, the names of above &s;ixty per&s;ons, highly re&s;pectable, of oppo&s;ite parties, and of no party, who&s;e te&s;timony
<PB N="76" REF="78">would indubitably have proved the facts I had &s;tated. I could ea&s;ily have doubled the number, had I not been con&s;cious that the coun&s;el would probably not call half of tho&s;e I had named.</P>
<P>The other particular was that my Soli|citor, Mr. Foulkes, wrote, in a manly man|ner to the Privy Council, his de&s;ire that I might be allowed my amanuen&s;is; and that the demand was immediately complied with. It was his extreme anxiety and &s;in|cere friend&s;hip that induced him to take this &s;tep; but it was without my know|ledge. I commend his intention with a warm, a glowing &s;en&s;e of its rectitude; and, had I been con&s;ulted, as far as I recollect the letter, I &s;hould have acquie&s;ced in &s;ending it; with this &s;ingle addition, that the thing required was required as an act of ju&s;tice; for that it did not become me to a&s;k or them to grant any thing that had not pure ju&s;tice for its ba&s;is.</P>
<P>And now I have little to add, except a ju&s;t acknowledgment to tho&s;e many kind and faithful friends who, from a conviction
<PB N="77" REF="79">of my innocence and the injury done me, &s;o chearfully and firmly came forward in my &s;upport. And it was &s;ome proof of the general tenor of my conduct, to &s;ee that tho&s;e who had known me the longe&s;t were the foremo&s;t. I make no efforts to expre&s;s my deep &s;en&s;e of gratitude and obligation; becau&s;e I con&s;ider &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ions generally as hypocritical, and always as erroneous. Men have nothing but du|ties to perform. Every action is either right or wrong. If it be right, the good that accrues to the whole is its true reward: it promotes the pre&s;ent happine&s;s of the parties; and by the nece&s;&s;ary perception of its good effects, increa&s;es their future good. But, though I profe&s;s no gratitude, I do not think I am le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the kindne&s;s I have received than tho&s;e who imagine gratitude to be the fir&s;t of virtues. While life and memory remain, I never can for|get the real virtues of the&s;e friends; and I hope too I never &s;hall forget to imitate them; for which, I think, they will con|tinue to have rea&s;on to e&s;teem me, much
<PB N="78" REF="80">more than if I were ince&s;&s;antly to have the words gratitude and obligation on my lips, and indolence and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in my heart. Tho&s;e virtues I will emulate, and tho&s;e virtues and the per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s them I mo&s;t affectionately e&s;teem.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO SIR JOHN SCOT, <HI>His Maje&s;ty's Attorney General.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EACH individual man is the creature of the various circum&s;tances under which he has exi&s;ted and continues to exi&s;t. His ac|tions may be good, or evil; and being pa&s;t are unalterable. But to blame him, who is a &s;en&s;itive being and nothing more or le&s;s, for being &s;ubject to &s;en&s;ation, is to blame water becau&s;e it is wet, winter that it is cold, &s;ummer that it is hot, and men that they are ignorant of the be&s;t means of promoting their own happine&s;s. To &s;earch after happine&s;s is the entire employment of their lives; and to accu&s;e them for pur|&s;uing
<PB N="80" REF="82">it in the manner which they imagine, however mi&s;takenly, will be&s;t attain their end, is an ab&s;urdity. Yet this is an ab&s;ur|dity which few men on earth have clearly and definitely perceived; and which it is probable all men, without exception, hourly commit. It is &s;eldom indeed that the man and the mi&s;take are not identified; though they ought everla&s;tingly to be kept di&s;tinct: for the mi&s;take is pa&s;t recal, but the man may amend. The error &s;hould never be &s;pared; the per&s;on ought never to be at|tacked. When mi&s;takes are pointed out, the man who committed them ought to be happy at their di&s;covery, and to con&s;ider them with exactly the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations as he would have done, had they been committed by another per&s;on. All men ought to feel thus; but I am well aware that at pre&s;ent no men do, except on tho&s;e rare occa&s;ions when they happen to recollect this prin|ciple, and unfortunately this principle is known only to a few.</P>
<P>If the doctrine I here &s;tate be true, you and I, &s;ir, have been compelled, by the laws
<PB N="81" REF="83">of our exi&s;tence, to act as we have done; and ought, when called to the revi&s;al of our actions, to be de&s;irous of perceiving the truth. We &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible di&s;cover their good or evil tendency, in its full extent; and, in either ca&s;e, the emotion excited, in|&s;tead of painful, ought always to be plea|&s;ant. Error once committed cannot be re|called; and &s;orrow is a fruitle&s;s and childi&s;h wa&s;te of our time, and conduces to an ha|bitual abu&s;e of our faculties; while joy at the di&s;covery is rational, becau&s;e it is only in proportion as we accurately know what is the tendency of our actions, in other words, that which is good from that which is evil, that we can exert our&s;elves to pro|mote individual and general happine&s;s.</P>
<P>That you have been led to di&s;approve &s;ome of my actions I mu&s;t take for granted, by the pro&s;ecution which, in the character of the Public Accu&s;er, you have lately in|&s;tituted again&s;t me. For I will not do your under&s;tanding that wrong to &s;uppo&s;e you could have placed any man in the danger to which your accu&s;ation brought me, merely
<PB N="82" REF="84">becau&s;e you were commanded &s;o to pur|&s;ue me. Yet of which of my actions you di&s;approve, and whether of many or of few, I own I am totally ignorant.</P>
<P>It is this perplexing que&s;tion, added to the prai&s;e you have received for the ho|nourable manner in which you have treated me, that are the cau&s;e and the &s;ubject of my letter. This prai&s;e too has been be|&s;towed from that tribunal on which the law (bear with me while I &s;ay, the fabulous law) pre&s;umes partiality cannot find place. Not &s;atisfied with this eulogium, one of your coadjutors laboured, with no little effort, to extend the panegyric. That you had acted honourably was not &s;ufficient. Mr. Ser|geant Adair informed the court, <Q>that you had acted with that candor and honour, that re&s;pect to a court and jury of your country, and that deference and regard to the <HI>liberties</HI> of your fellow-&s;ubjects, which &s;o peculiarly mark your character, and have &s;o honourably di&s;tingui&s;hed your conduct!</Q></P>
<P>This emphatical and ample tribute of
<PB N="83" REF="85">prai&s;e was yet in&s;ufficient: he again re|turned to his eulogy, which &s;eemed to op|pre&s;s his imagination. "Gentlemen," &s;aid he, <Q>four of the&s;e per&s;ons have been this day acquitted; I had almo&s;t &s;aid by the con&s;ent of His Maje&s;ty's Attorney Ge|neral, but more properly by his <HI>for bear|ing</HI> to con&s;ent to adduce any evidence again&s;t them!</Q> In this tone, worthy as it &s;eems to me of a French Academician declaiming on the virtues of a <HI>Grand Mo|narque,</HI> he continued; but I <HI>forbear</HI> further quotation, having already cited all that is nece&s;&s;ary for my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There is &s;urely a mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing and injurious confu&s;ion in the common terms of language. Honourable is the word on which the&s;e eulogi&s;ts have mo&s;t dwelt, and mo&s;t delighted in. And what is honour|able? Is it &s;omething more, or &s;omething le&s;s, than right? If, &s;ir, this very honour|able dealing were &s;omething more than right, to me for example, was it not &s;ome|thing wrong, to others? that is, to men in
<PB N="84" REF="86">general? And can any man prove that to do wrong to men in general is to do right, nay more than right, to an individual? What hypocri&s;y, what fal&s;ehood is it that lurks under &s;uch common-place expre&s;&s;ions? Do they mean any thing, or do they mean nothing? But honourable, that is, more than right, is inadequate to the expre&s;&s;ion of your merits; and forbearance, or more than more than right, is brought in as an auxiliary, to &s;trengthen the in&s;ufficient prai&s;e. It is &s;trange that the profe&s;&s;ion of a lawyer, which in many in&s;tances &s;eems to oblige the profe&s;&s;or to &s;tudy with un|common attention the accurate meaning of terms and phra&s;es, &s;hould yet beget the perplexity and inexplicable contradictions which we &s;o often find to be its offspring. I own that, in this in&s;tance, it was the jargon of common-place which Mr. Serjeant Adair employed; but &s;urely, by a man of his ac|knowledged acumen and &s;uperior talents, it ought to have been detected. In this ho|nourable acquittal, this forbearing to adduce
<PB N="85" REF="87">evidence, you, &s;ir, either did that which was right or that which was wrong. My opi|nion is, you did that which was wrong.</P>
<P>Except the fal&s;e accu&s;ation, by which you brought me to the bar, I con&s;ider this ho|nourable dealing, this forbearing to adduce evidence, as the greate&s;t injury you have done me. I was acquitted! What could I de&s;ire more? This was the que&s;tion which the eyes and ge&s;tures of the whole legal phalanx, judges, barri&s;ters, and clerks, &s;eem|ed to a&s;k, when I had the in&s;olence to de&s;ire to be heard. I &s;peak the language which their features &s;poke. Had not the Law re|lea&s;ed me, from its harpy talons? and ought I not to have &s;tolen away, and be happy &s;o to e&s;cape? What! My head on my &s;houlders and yet complain! Well might the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice exclaim, "It was not to be endured!" Yes, &s;ir, &s;urrounded as you were by the death-dealing expounders of Bracton, Coke, and the Statutes at large, I would mo&s;t gladly have encountered their united thunders, would you but have &s;uf|fered me, after being publicly accu&s;ed, to
<PB N="86" REF="88">have been as publicly heard. The thing I de&s;ired was that the world &s;hould know I had been accu&s;ed totally without founda|tion; that my pro&s;ecutors had ab&s;olutely no proof of my guilt; and that I had proof irrefragable of my innocence. This, &s;ir, was what I wanted: but this was what they did not want. I mu&s;t be &s;ilenced, I mu&s;t be menaced, I mu&s;t be in&s;ulted by the hands of a jailor at the nod of a judge, after having &s;uffered fal&s;e impri&s;onment, the lo&s;s of pro|perty and a mo&s;t iniquitous attack on my phy&s;ical and moral exi&s;tence, my life and utility.</P>
<P>Sir, I prote&s;t I &s;peak with no per&s;onal enmity, to them or you; but I &s;peak with a &s;trong and deep &s;en&s;e of the moral tur|pitude of your mi&s;takes. No; in&s;tead of exciting to vengeance, I wi&s;h to warn the world, in this and every in&s;tance, not to confound the man with the errors of his under&s;tanding. Had that been more cor|rect, his actions would have been le&s;s vi|cious. He intends good, and ought to be in&s;tructed; not tortured, not torn to pieces,
<PB N="87" REF="89">not hanged drawn and quartered, when he commits evil.</P>
<P>Sir, the very rea&s;on of my &s;urrender was that I might be tried. Had I feared the evidence you had to adduce, that is, had I really been guilty, I &s;hould have thought it my duty to have done that which you gave me the opportunity of doing; to have fled. For, though I can as little approve of my own guilt, I mean my own mi&s;takes when I know them to be &s;uch, as I can of yours, yet I would not have been wilfully acce&s;&s;ary to more guilt; that of the mo&s;t pernicious of puni&s;hments, death; when I did not per|ceive how my death could have been bene|ficial to mankind. Conver&s;ing with Mr. Horne Tooke on the morning of our ar|raignment, he told me that the be&s;t thing our profecutors could have done, for the cau&s;e of freedom, was that which they had done; impri&s;on and indict us; except the &s;till better thing which they had yet to do; namely, to hang us. Though I widely differed with him concerning the be&s;t, I like him was convinced that, after this
<PB N="88" REF="90">wrong had been committed, wi&s;e and vir|tuous men might develop its evil con&s;equen|ces, and thus turn it to the benefit of the community. But this, &s;ir, could only be done by di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, by a faithful &s;tatement of facts from which le&s;&s;ons of future wi&s;dom might be deduced, and by a &s;agacious fore|&s;ight of the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>If &s;o, my writing to you is an act of duty; and, though your office be that of accu&s;ation, you will &s;carcely accu&s;e me for having performed it. In the cour&s;e of the pamphlet of which this letter is a part, I have &s;tated &s;ome of the public and &s;ome of the private injuries that have been com|mitted in my ca&s;e; and in the&s;e I con&s;ider you as a principal participator: but I tax your mi&s;takes, not your per&s;on; and, though I have been impri&s;oned, defamed, put in danger of my life, and refu&s;ed a trial, nay a hearing of half an hour as a thing in|tolerable to men &s;eated on the tribunal of ju&s;tice, I neither &s;peak in anger, &s;eek re|venge, nor wi&s;h you harm. If honourable, as here applied to you, have a good mean|ing,
<PB N="89" REF="91">I deny your honourable dealing. If it have a bad one, you will &s;carcely deem it worthy your acceptance: and if it have none, perhaps the per&s;ons who employed it will have le&s;s of a &s;elfi&s;h motive for blu&s;h|ing than if it had expre&s;&s;ed all that they intended.</P>
<P>In fine, &s;ir, the e&s;&s;ential que&s;tion, con|cerning which the general &s;afety is inte|re&s;ted, that which many have a&s;ked and more will a&s;k, is, Why did you include my name in the indictment? I &s;ay mine in par|ticular, becau&s;e, though the que&s;tion may well be put for all the per&s;ons indicted, yet, I &s;tood &s;o peculiarly aloof from &s;u&s;picion as to make your proceeding dangerou&s;ly in|comprehen&s;ible? By what arguments, is it uncharitable to &s;ay by what arts, did your agents &s;o confound and mi&s;lead the grand jury as to induce them to return a true bill? Sir, there are many who put &s;uch interroga|tions with a rational anxiety for their own &s;afety. I was a member of the Con&s;titutional Society: is that your only an&s;wer? There were many members of that &s;ociety,
<PB N="90" REF="92">for I do not know the number: why did you not indict them all? Is there a man in England who is a more enthu&s;ia&s;tic friend to a &s;y&s;tem of peace, and a more ardent op|po&s;er of violence than I am? But, I was a member of the Committee of Conference. Why were not all the members indicted? I appeared at it but once, and you had evi|dence that I then <Q>talked a great deal about peace; of my being again&s;t any violent or coercive means, that were u&s;ually re|&s;orted to again&s;t our fellow-creatures: that I urged the more powerful operations of philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on, to convince man of his errors; nay, zealot as you no doubt will deem me, that man might di&s;arm his greate&s;t enemy by tho&s;e means, and oppo&s;e his fury, becau&s;e truth is all powerful; that I gave advice to the above effect to the delegates pre&s;ent, who all &s;eemed to agree, as no per&s;on oppo&s;ed my arguments; and that this conver&s;ation la&s;ted better than an hour.</Q></P>
<P>What, &s;ir! In a &s;y&s;tem which you pre|tend was to overturn the government and
<PB N="91" REF="93">depo&s;e and kill the king, was a man who, being with the imaginary con&s;pirators whom on the face of facts he certainly did not &s;uppo&s;e to be con&s;pirators, was this urgent preacher of peace, this enthu&s;ia&s;tic apo&s;tle of non-re&s;i&s;tence, a fit man to be &s;e|lected by way of preference? The error appears to be &s;o gro&s;s that it is &s;carcely hy|perbolical to a&s;k, whether the per&s;on who committed it was not at that moment a luna|tic? You might di&s;like my principles, and I could be glad that one of us were better informed; you might think my peaceful exhortations dangerous, that I can ea&s;ily conceive; but how could you &s;o impo&s;e upon your under&s;tanding as to imagine them trea&s;onable? What! The man that, meeting the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;pirators, argues by the hour for order and peace in all their proceedings, does he excite to in&s;urrection? is he too a con&s;pirator? How does it ap|pear? Produce your proofs, &s;ir, and re&s;cue your under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Yes; I know you mu&s;t have been de|ceived; though, with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity
<PB N="92" REF="94">of heart I prote&s;t, I cannot conceive how: except by that dereliction of mind which, if not in&s;anity, I know not by what name it can properly be called. However, &s;ir, that I may deal with the &s;tricte&s;t imparti|ality, I will &s;tate the only circum&s;tance that has come to my knowledge of the proof you intended to bring again&s;t me.</P>
<P>After the per&s;ons apprehended had been all of them examined, and &s;ome I believe committed to the Tower, while Mr. Sharp, who&s;e te&s;timony I have quoted as given before the Privy Council, was in the cu&s;|tody of an officer though &s;uffered to re|main in his own hou&s;e, I and a friend paid him a vi&s;it; the officer being pre&s;ent. Be|lieving as it has proved that there were not private proceedings or trea&s;onable con&s;pira|cies exi&s;ting, and therefore that govern|ment mu&s;t have by &s;ome means been unac|countably mi&s;led, I conjectured that this might have happened from the fal&s;ehoods which the pa&s;&s;ions and the &s;elfi&s;h views of their inferior agents had engendered. To guard again&s;t the&s;e mi&s;coceptions, and
<PB N="93" REF="95">fal&s;ehoods, was at this moment a very &s;e|rious duty. Our vi&s;it was to Mr. Sharp, but the officer thought proper to mingle in the conver&s;ation; and, though he was not a King's me&s;&s;enger, but of a lower and more illiterate order, I do not think the remarks of &s;uch men ought to be treated with di&s;|dian. In an&s;wer therefore to &s;ome of the&s;e remarks, I &s;aid a few words; intimating that violence was always a vice, by whom|&s;oever committed. This he &s;eemed to feel as an attack upon his profe&s;&s;ion; and, con|ceiving me to be a dangerous per&s;on, a Ja|cobin no doubt, affirmed that he had &s;een me at the meetings or a meeting of the Corre&s;ponding Society. I immediately de|nied it, and he again a&s;&s;erted he had &s;een me there. The man who could imagine and per&s;i&s;t in one fal&s;ehood, might imagine and per&s;i&s;t in another. This in&s;tantly made me recollect my former reflections, and brought to my view the mi&s;chiefs in which the mi&s;takes of a number of &s;uch men might involve the nation. I did not act from blind pa&s;&s;ion; I intended to make
<PB N="94" REF="96">a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon him, and in a firm but undi&s;turbed tone of voice &s;aid to him, "Sir, you are a liar!" Again he repeated the affirmative, and I with increa&s;|ing firmne&s;s replied&mdash;"It is a <HI>wicked</HI> lie, &s;ir!"</P>
<P>Mr. Sharp's letter &s;ays <HI>impudent.</HI> A word may ea&s;ily be changed. I think my|&s;elf certain, from the &s;pirit in which I &s;poke and the effect I wi&s;hed to produce, that the epithet was wicked; though that is of little moment.</P>
<P>This was con&s;trued into a de&s;ign on my part to affront the officer, produce violence, and favour the e&s;cape of Mr. Sharp. An ignorant man might ea&s;ily &s;o mi&s;con&s;true: but would an ignorant man forget that he was guilty of the eva&s;ion of &s;aying that, if he had not &s;een me at the meetings of the Corre&s;ponding Society, he had &s;een me at Mr. Thelwall's Lectures; and that I im|mediately replied, I had been pre&s;ent once, and never but once, at a lecture delivered by Mr. Thelwall? Did he forget too that there was another per&s;on, who&s;e name I do not
<PB N="95" REF="97">know, in the room; and that this per&s;on left the room before the departure of my friend and my&s;elf? that, if &s;uch had been our de&s;ign, we were then more at liberty; &s;ince the per&s;on by going proved he was not in this alarming con&s;piracy? yet that, after &s;itting &s;ome little time, and I conver&s;ing with my former coolne&s;s, the moment the man was &s;ilenced on this &s;ubject, we left him with|out any &s;igns ofire&s;entment or oppo&s;ition?</P>
<P>But, &s;ir, &s;uppo&s;ing my mode of produc|ing the effect I de&s;ired as vicious and as un|worthy as you plea&s;e (and I &s;u&s;pected even at the time that it had vice in it, though I knew not how taken &s;o &s;uddenly to act otherwi&s;e) yet, was telling this man, or any man who had really uttered a danger|ous lie, that he was a liar, trea&s;on? A treble guard was immediately put upon Mr. Sharp, which is proof indeed that the man had &s;o told his &s;tory as to produce alarm in the Privy Council, who&s;e &s;y&s;tem it was to alarm and be alarmed. But what had this man's being pronounced a liar in com|mon with trea&s;on? This was &s;everal months
<PB N="96" REF="98">too before the pre&s;enting the bill of indict|ment. No &s;econd attempt had been made for the e&s;cape of Mr. Sharp; and, if we had wi&s;hed his flight, could you, &s;ir, think, con&s;pirators and deep de&s;igners as we were, that we &s;hould have planned and executed our plot with &s;uch contemptible inefficacy? You might believe us to be wicked and weak, but &s;urely you could not &s;uppo&s;e we were idiots. Why was I not examined too, before the Privy Council, for this as well as for the re&s;t of my con&s;piracies? What po&s;&s;ible an&s;wer can be given to that que&s;tion? Surely you would not de&s;ign|edly avoid the encounter of a man of &s;uch &s;hallow intellect as &s;uch a failure would in|dicate.</P>
<P>Sir, the &s;ub&s;tance of this addre&s;s is, that I have been accu&s;ed by you of high trea&s;on; that the accu&s;ation was a flagrant breach of ju&s;tice, for you had no proof whatever again&s;t me, but e&s;&s;ential evidence in my fa|vour; that, by the management of the pro|&s;ecutors, of whom you are officially at the head, the indictment was returned a true
<PB N="97" REF="99">bill; that I have &s;uffered all the evils of impri&s;onment, family alarm, wa&s;ting of &s;ub&s;tance and lo&s;s of time; that, in addi|tion to the&s;e, you inflicted a wrong greater than them all, you refu&s;ed to let me be heard in my own defence by refu&s;ing to bring me to trial; that you did this to avoid the di&s;|grace of having indicted a man for the enormous crime of High Trea&s;on contrary to evidence; and that you &s;at and by your &s;ilence acquie&s;ced in the prai&s;e that was be|&s;towed upon you, for the la&s;t and greate&s;t of the&s;e acts of inju&s;tice. The conclu&s;ion I am obliged to draw, &s;ir, is a very obvious one. You hold an office which while you exerci&s;e, &s;ince you can be guilty of errors &s;o dangerous as the&s;e, the life of no man in the kingdom is &s;afe. Be ju&s;t to your&s;elf and your fellow &s;ubjects; acknowledge that you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s that cool unpreju|diced impartiality which this office re|quires; do the right which is yet in your power; relieve the nation of its fears; and abandon a &s;tation for which all di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate men will affirm you are un&s;it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Eyre.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Hearing, as I take it for granted you will hear through &s;ome channel, of my pre&s;ent addre&s;s to your Lord&s;hip, I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, by the warning you gave me when I expre&s;&s;ed my intention in the open court of publi&s;hing my thoughts, that you will not expect me to be temperate. I know not why you &s;hould have formed &s;uch an opinion: you certainly, as I be|lieve, had no proof on which it might be built. On the two occa&s;ions of my &s;urren|der and my acquittal, I am utterly igno|rant of my own emotions if I were not de|terminedly cool, and collected. I &s;u&s;pect your lord&s;hip had not developed your own motives; and that they were a latent con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I had what is generally &s;up|po&s;ed to be very great cau&s;e of complaint. The manner in which I was prevented from &s;peaking, whether intentionally or
<PB N="99" REF="101">not, had every appearance of the pro&s;ecu|tors being fearful that I &s;hould &s;peak di&s;|agreeable truths. I have publi&s;hed the ad|dre&s;s I had prepared, and you, they, and the world may now decide.</P>
<P>This is but the preface to the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent letter; which I mean to be a few nece&s;&s;ary remarks and arguments, on the propo&s;itions delivered by your lord&s;hip, when I appeared before you. And here I mu&s;t entreat your &s;erious attention, to a di&s;tinction which I think ought to be made. Truth contemplates man as the creature of the circum&s;tances under which he exi&s;ts; and, did tho&s;e circum&s;tances vary, he would then inevitably be different. In other words, I con&s;ider your lord&s;hip as conviction obliges me to con&s;ider all human beings; that is, as a man who acts from knowledge, when you promote the gene|ral good; and when you do the rever&s;e, from ignorance. I attribute no malice to you, but &s;ome mi&s;takes; and tho&s;e mi&s;|takes are rendered dangerous by the talents
<PB N="100" REF="102">you po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the &s;tation you fill. I ad|mir your faculties, becau&s;e they are com|prehen&s;ive. I cen&s;ure your errors, be|cau&s;e they are baneful. I know that, if I had the power to convince you that they are errors, you would commit them no more; and, if I want that power, who or what am I to accu&s;e; except the mutual want of the means of making our&s;elves in|telligible; that is, our mutual ignorance? Let us both therefore &s;incerely and cordi|ally exert our&s;elves to forget per&s;ons, and inquire into facts.</P>
<P>The heads of the inquiries I wi&s;h to be made, taken in the order in which they occurred when I appeared before you, are the&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What is indulgence?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What is right?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. May not a man's country, that is, the government its officers and a grand jury, commit inju&s;tice?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Was the act of &s;urrendering my&s;elf the part of a good citizen, and an hone&s;t man?</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="101" REF="103">
5. Was it to warn, or to intimidate, that you advi&s;ed me to take care of pub|li&s;hing my &s;entiments, on my own ca&s;e?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>There is another que&s;tion, namely, the honourable dealing of the Attorney Gene|ral, which I &s;hall omit to di&s;cu&s;s with your lord&s;hip; becau&s;e I have already ad|dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to that gentleman.</P>
<P N="1">1. To begin with the fir&s;t, your lord&s;hip will no doubt recollect that, when I a&s;ked for the attendance of my amanuen&s;is, you an&s;wered that, unle&s;s my health made it re|qui&s;ite, it would be contrary to cu&s;tom, and an indulgence which you could not grant. My lord, contrary to cu&s;tom is one thing; indulgence is another. The forms of courts may be regulated by cu&s;|tom; and to tho&s;e, whether ju&s;t or unju&s;t, having accepted the high office you hold, you may think proper to conform. But what does indulgence mean? That too mu&s;t either be ju&s;t or unju&s;t. If it mean a ju&s;t action, &s;urely a ju&s;t action is no in|dulgence. If it mean an unju&s;t action, it &s;carcely can be characterized by a word
<PB N="102" REF="104">which, if it have any preci&s;e meaning, &s;eems to incline to the &s;ide of benevolence. It is no fault of mine, my lord, that the world has long been amu&s;ing it&s;elf with words, in&s;tead of truth. When you men|tioned health, had not a &s;evere adherence to veracity re&s;trained me, I might have profited by the hint. I did not forget that I had a di&s;ea&s;e, with which I had been af|flicted between two and three years; but it was not of a nature to make the attendance of a &s;ervant nece&s;&s;ary. That was not my motive for a&s;king the aid of another hand. To have pleaded &s;uch a motive, though the lax morality of the world would have con|&s;trued it into truth, would have been fal&s;e|hood; and very unworthy of a man act|ing upon the principles which brought me to &s;urrender my&s;elf in that court. I then wi&s;hed to act truly; and I now wi&s;h to excite your lord&s;hip and all mankind to the examination of truth. I think there|fore you will ea&s;ily di&s;cover there can be no &s;uch things as indulgence; and that it is a word which ought even to be bani&s;hed the
<PB N="103" REF="105">nur&s;ery, and is highly unworthy of a court of ju&s;tice. Either it was right that I &s;hould have the aid I required, to enable me to demon&s;trate my innocence, or it was wrong. That is, it was right or wrong to deny me the means of ju&s;tification: as in|deed impri&s;onment and all other con&s;traint more or le&s;s do deny. But of this your lord&s;hip and the world in general have hi|therto been but little aware; nor is it pro|bable that I &s;hould have the power of awakening you.</P>
<P N="2">2. The la&s;t time I was brought before your lord&s;hip, you informed me that, "having been acquitted, I had no right to addre&s;s one word either to the court or the jury." The &s;ame que&s;tion again occurs. I &s;uppo&s;e, your lord&s;hip meant I had no right according to the cu&s;tom of the court. That however I believe is a fact not well e&s;tabli&s;hed. But I con&s;ider all rules that have nothing better than cu&s;tom for their ba&s;is as founded in error. I &s;hall there|fore only a&s;k, was it ju&s;t or unju&s;t that I, having been publi&s;hed a traitor to the whole nation, &s;hould employ every means
<PB N="104" REF="106">in my power to prove to the nation how entirely innocent I had been of the crime laid to my charge? If right &s;ignify ju&s;t, is it not right that every man &s;hould be as u&s;eful in &s;ociety as po&s;&s;ible? And does the &s;u&s;pected man enjoy his full extent of uti|lity? Did this dumb acquittal leave me wholly un&s;u&s;pected? I can &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure your lord&s;hip it did not. Since my relea&s;e from pri&s;on, I daily meet men, who u&s;ed to approach me with &s;miles and friend&s;hip, who now avert their eyes, and either from di&s;like or timidity &s;hun my acquaintance. I &s;tate a fact, not a complaint. I a&s;ked only half an hour; and was an&s;wered, with an exclamation, that a &s;peech of half an hour was a thing not to be endured. What then were the &s;peeches of the coun|&s;el for the crown; when accu&s;ation, when acrimony, when puni&s;hment were the pur|&s;uit? Speeches of &s;even, eight, and nine hours were endurable. Readings, repeti|tions, litigious quibbles, and the te&s;timo|nies of &s;pies, which protracted a &s;entence on which probably the lives of thou&s;ands and hundreds of thou&s;ands depended to
<PB N="105" REF="107">the enormous length of eight days, be|ginning early in the morning and fre|quently ending after midnight the&s;e were endurable. And, if ju&s;tice could be for|warded by &s;uch inquiries, &s;o they ought to be: but of that I vehemently doubt. Could I have &s;poken for eight days, and by &s;peaking have conduced to the promoting of ju&s;tice, I ought to have been patiently and attentively heard. I will &s;ay more, though in none of the&s;e things I expect to be joined by your lord&s;hip; which is that, had my &s;peech of half an hour been wholly wrong, it ought to have been heard: and for this plain rea&s;on, that my errors, by being known, might have &s;ome chance of being corrected.</P>
<P>But there are other and more obvious motives, which imperiou&s;ly called on me to &s;peak, and on my country to hear. I had been rendered a &s;u&s;pected man to the nation. A bill for high trea&s;on had been pre&s;ented again&s;t me; and had been found, in the language of your lord&s;hip, by my country. On this indictment your lord|&s;hip had committed me to pri&s;on. I had
<PB N="106" REF="108">been brought to the bar, and arraigned; and every means, except the la&s;t, had been taken by the law, which could induce my countrymen to believe I was the traitor the indictment a&s;&s;erted me to be. My lord, after proceedings &s;o awful as the&s;e, to forbid an innocent man to counteract their dan|gerous con&s;equences, by informing man|kind of truths relative to his own conduct of which they were ignorant, and a know|ledge of which would re&s;tore him to their good opinion, is one of tho&s;e violent acts of inju&s;tice again&s;t which it is the duty of every man to prote&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. I was told by your lord&s;hip, that, I &s;tood indicted by my country; and that no man who happens to &s;tand in that &s;ituation ought to complain of inju&s;tice; becau&s;e he accu&s;es his country of inju&s;tice, when he makes that complaint."&mdash;I own to your lord&s;hip that I have &s;eldom heard a propo|&s;ition more extraordinary. It may be the language of the law, but &s;urely common &s;en&s;e revolts at it. What, is it impo&s;&s;ible for my country to be mi&s;taken? And of what does this country con&s;i&s;t? Of three-and-twenty
<PB N="107" REF="109">men, nominated by the officers of the Crown, compo&s;ing what is called a grand jury, in&s;tructed by the crown I &s;peak of this ca&s;e) hearing none but the witne&s;&s;es for the crown, and deciding by a majority. Will it be affirmed that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e men to be guilty of error? And is not all error unju&s;t? Was there never an innocent man hanged? And was his coun|try, which put him to death, guilty of no inju&s;tice? I think I can demon&s;trate that all wars are unju&s;t; but no man will affirm that offen&s;ive and predatory wars are not &s;o. And were there never offen&s;ive and preda|tory wars? Has this country never under|taken &s;uch wars? Or is this country exclu|&s;ively exempt from error? I have heard na|tional prejudices too frequently repeated; but I never heard an a&s;&s;ertion &s;o violent as this, except from the mouth of lawyers, ut|tering the &s;ictions of law. Ignorant as I am of the&s;e fictions, till this period I was ig|norant that this was one of them. I had heard that the king could do no wrong; but never before knew that his &s;ubjects were equally infallible. I affirm that wrong has
<PB N="108" REF="110">been committed on me; and, if my country had no concern in it, I mu&s;t conclude that the mini&s;ters of this country, the attorney general, the grand jury, and the other per|&s;ons concerned, were no part of my coun|try; a conclu&s;ion which, in the pre&s;ent &s;elf+admiring temper of Engli&s;hmen, would pro|bably not be very grateful to them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Perhaps I have too great an aptitude to feel &s;urpri&s;e. If &s;o, I am willing my mi&s;takes &s;hould be known; for I confe&s;s I again felt extreme &s;urpri&s;e, when I heard my&s;elf reproached by your lord&s;hip, for &s;ur|rendering my&s;elf after a bill had been found again&s;t me for high trea&s;on. What, my lord! Being con&s;cious of my own inno|cence, would you have advi&s;ed me to the clande&s;tine act of concealment; of flight; of inducing the world to believe me guilty? Surely in this in&s;tance your lord&s;hip's me|mory &s;lept: you had forgotten even your own law, which admits the appearance or &s;light of the pri&s;oner as pre&s;umptive proof of innocence or guilt. Nay, do you not in|&s;truct the jury to inquire among the fir&s;t of their proceedings whether the per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed
<PB N="109" REF="111">"fled for it?" But leaving law, and recurring to a more accurate &s;tandard, to ju&s;tice, is that man ju&s;t to him&s;elf or to the community who, by his cowardice, renders him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected, and robs him&s;elf and his country of as much utility as this &s;u&s;picion de&s;troys? Would your lord&s;hip bid inno|cence live under the &s;tigma of guilt? Would you conde&s;cend &s;o to live? I will not think &s;o meanly of you! Greatly mi&s;taken as I conceive you have been, in many parts of the late legal proceedings, I have a much higher opinion of your under&s;tanding. It would not &s;uffer you to practi&s;e a precept &s;o injurious, and &s;o unmanly. When I came to &s;urrender my&s;elf, you informed me you would not take ad|vantage of my indi&s;cretion. I will not doubt but that you felt kindly, and meant me well: but were you not deceived? How was I indi&s;creet? Was there no intention to apprehend after having indicted me? Mini&s;try in&s;tituted the pro&s;ecution: could I &s;uppo&s;e that the only end they had in view was to &s;tigmatize and render me &s;u&s;pected? Or, if I had entertained that belief, ought I
<PB N="110" REF="112">to have &s;ubmitted to the injurious fal&s;ehood, and walk at large a proclaimed traitor? No; that mini&s;try certainly would not have en|dured: as little perhaps as I could endure the ignominy of concealment. Well then, ought I to have &s;ubjected my&s;elf to have been guarded through the &s;treets a pri&s;oner, and brought like a culprit into the pre&s;ence of the blindly accu&s;ing law, when I could &s;o far walk a free man, to deliver my&s;elf up to my pro&s;ecutors? Who will affirm that either of the&s;e would have been the act of a wi&s;e and virtuous man, con&s;cious of his owninnocence?</P>
<P N="5">5. When I informed the court, being denied the liberty of &s;peaking, that I mu&s;t take &s;ome other means of publi&s;hing my &s;entiments concerning the pro&s;ecution that had been in&s;tituted again&s;t me, this was your lord&s;hip's an&s;wer&mdash;"You had better take care of that, &s;ir; or you may get into another &s;crape, as &s;oon as you are relieved from this."&mdash;I replied that I was very willing to &s;uffer for what I conceived to be right; and your lord&s;hip turned back on the bench, with an interjection expre&s;&s;ing &s;trong di&s;|approbation. Again I am at i&s;&s;ue with
<PB N="111" REF="113">your lord&s;hip. I know but one &s;tandard for all the actions of men; and the que&s;tion will eternally recur, is the action right, or wrong? ju&s;t, or unju&s;t? Was it my duty to publi&s;h facts, which I &s;uppo&s;e may aid men in their future conduct, or was it not? Ima|gine me to be at pre&s;ent under the influence of pa&s;&s;ion, or any other error: yet, is it not healthful to my&s;lf and to &s;ociety that I &s;hould make my errors known; le&s;t, by being trea&s;ured up in my mind, they &s;hould corrode till they bur&s;t forth with tenfold virulence? How are mi&s;takes to be cor|rected, while they remain undi&s;covered? If I utter fal&s;ehood of any kind, has govern|ment no per&s;on in pay, who can tell truth? Is it fal&s;ehood, or is it fact, that government is unwilling to hear? Why was it de&s;irable that no further inquiry &s;hould take place, after the pri&s;oners who had e&s;caped a cruel and barbarous death &s;hould be relea&s;ed? Are proceedings &s;o &s;erious to all men imme|diately to be hu&s;hed, and &s;mothered in &s;i|lence, as &s;oon as the pro&s;ecutors &s;hall have failed in attempts which were either ju&s;t or unju&s;t? If ju&s;t, why &s;hould they &s;hun in|quiry?
<PB N="112" REF="114">If unju&s;t, will your lord&s;hip affirm that inju&s;tice ought not to be made public? Our king and our country, it &s;eems, can do no wrong. Are mini&s;try equally impecca|ble? Is there any law fiction to protect them? I do not mean their per&s;ons, but their actions; their mi&s;takes, if it be po&s;&s;ible that they ever did or ever can commit any.</P>
<P>"I had better take care, or I may get in|to another &s;crape." I will not carp at a word which though vulgar was expre&s;&s;ive; but will a&s;k your lord&s;hip by what action of mine it was that I got into a &s;crape? How am I to avoid getting into another? By what &s;ecret is any man to avoid fal&s;e accu&s;ation? Is your lord&s;hip wi&s;e enough to know? If you are, for charity's &s;ake make it public: reformers have been and are in perilous need of it.</P>
<P>Surely the better judgment of your lord|&s;hip had for&s;aken you, during this whole dia|logue! I do not &s;eek to injure you in the opi|nion of your countrymen: if I did, the ac|cu&s;ation of &s;o unprotected a per&s;on you would probably di&s;regard. I have declared my &s;entiments concerning your talents, and
<PB N="113" REF="115">your mi&s;takes. I am equally &s;incere in both, though I have but lightly touched on either; for this letter is but a trifle to what I could write, on the proceedings in which you have been involved in the cour&s;e of this pro&s;ecution. But they are foreign to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and if they were not, I would endeavour as I now do to convince your lord&s;hip that I have and could have no motive but the de&s;ire, not of doing in|jury to an individual, but good to all. I give my thoughts for what they are worth; let tho&s;e examine them who think they de|&s;erve to be examined. It may well be doubted whether I can &s;ugge&s;t any new truth; but I think it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould place old ones now and then in a clear point of view. That you &s;hould feel offended to hear a man declare him&s;elf willing to &s;uffer for doing that which he believed to be right, that is, for di&s;charging what he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a duty, was a thing which if I had not &s;een and heard I &s;carcely &s;hould have cre|dited. You might believe, though I know not why you &s;hould, that I &s;hould certainly
<PB N="114" REF="116">do wrong; yet, in your cooler moments, you could not I think but applaud the intention: and I conclude with repeating my per&s;ua&s;ion that your judgment was le&s;s &s;ound, on this occa&s;ion, than it generally is in occurrences perhaps le&s;s &s;erious in their con&s;equences.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To Mr. Serjeant Adair.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter to the Attorney General, I have quoted &s;ome &s;entiments, which you delivered in your opening again&s;t Mr. Thel|wall, and which I think it behoves me to notice. I have there made &s;ome remarks on them, and here intend to add a few more; but mu&s;t previou&s;ly repeat the &s;ub&s;tance of what you will find I have &s;aid in my pre|fatory addre&s;&s;es, to Mr. Attorney General and Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Eyre, that the mo|tive of my writing is not to give you pain, but, by detecting your mi&s;takes, to add as I
<PB N="115" REF="117">hope to the means of general improvement. Perhaps you may think the &s;uppo&s;ition that I have the power to give pain, undignified and unprotected by the great as I am, is a trait of arrogance. I believe however this to be a mi&s;take beneath your under&s;tanding. You have been too long familiar with an elevated &s;ituation to imagine that any thing but the efforts of &s;ound rea&s;on can &s;hield a man from the pain of accu&s;ation; whether it be fal&s;e or true. But, &s;ir, though I con|ceive you will be more di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, there are per&s;ons who are &s;o devoured with zeal again&s;t Jacobins, among whom, were there no other circum&s;tances, this pro&s;ecution has in their opinion ranked me, that arrogant will be too &s;oft a term to expre&s;s their &s;en|&s;ations.</P>
<P>This is a matter of trifling moment. My pre&s;ent theme is the forbearing benevolence of His Maje&s;ty's Attorney General. Will you patiently permit me to tell you, &s;ir, how forbearing that gentleman has been? He forbore to call evidence again&s;t me; which, according to the phra&s;e, was very honour|able in him indeed; for he had none to call.
<PB N="116" REF="118">He forbore to keep me and my fellow &s;ufferers longer in pri&s;on; becau&s;e he was con&s;cious that the minds of men revolted at the inju&s;|tice of the puni&s;hment we had already en|dured. He forbore to exa&s;perate the public more by the di&s;clo&s;ure of the extreme folly of which, in the fervor of his accu&s;ing zeal, he had been guilty; in charging a man with the crime of High Trea&s;on at the mo|ment when he had depo&s;itions to prove the man &s;o charged to be the enthu&s;ia&s;tic preacher of peace, and the determined op|ponent of violence. I have called it folly: by what word would you have charac|terized &s;uch conduct? Yes, &s;ir, he forbore to pro&s;ecute, in proportion as he perceived he wanted the power. He forbore to in|flict evil, the moment he di&s;covered how dangerous his conduct was become. I would not be under&s;tood to &s;ay, or &s;up|po&s;e, that he thought it evil; but did his mi&s;takes le&s;&s;en the injury? His forbearance has indeed been exemplary, and I fear he will &s;till continue to forbear. He will probably forbear, in all companies into which he goes, to inform them that he has
<PB N="117" REF="119">accu&s;ed without proof, has acquitted with reluctance, and has pa&s;&s;ed through Temple Bar with a confu&s;ed mind, if not with an aching heart. He forbore to vi&s;it and con|&s;ole the families of the pri&s;oners, by who&s;e indu&s;try till manacled by him the&s;e fami|lies had been &s;upported; and he will &s;till forbear to inquire whether the &s;ires of tho&s;e pri&s;oners be &s;tarving, their children naked, or their wives living or dead. Let him: if he be not unexpectedly wi&s;e, or deplo|rably erroneous, &s;uch forbearance will con|duce to the quiet of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I have but one que&s;tion more to a&s;k, and that, &s;ir, relates wholly to your&s;elf. You are a man who have as I may &s;ay been trammeled in the manners and cu&s;toms of courts of law. You have &s;at upon the bench, and been led to con&s;ider the duties and even delicacies of &s;uch a &s;ituation. You are not ignorant that every expiation, which kind and re&s;pectful treatment can publicly afford, is due to a man who has been acquit|ted by his country, for this acquittal avows the accu&s;ation to have been fal&s;e. Where,
<PB N="118" REF="120">&s;ir, was the kindne&s;s, where the re&s;pect, where the decency, of telling a man, who had ju&s;t been acquitted by his country, that the rea&s;on of his acquittal was the forbear|ing to introduce witne&s;&s;es? Sir, I intend no per&s;onal offence when I &s;ay it was &s;o far from kind, re&s;pectful, or decent, that it was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. You forgot your&s;elt. Men are &s;ubject to mi&s;takes, and all that I here intend is to vindicate and do ju&s;tice to my own character, again&s;t an error which I hope you would not frequently be &s;o for|getful of what is due to ju&s;tice and to a per&s;on fal&s;ely accu&s;ed as to commit.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To the Honourable Thomas Er&s;kine; and Vicary Gibbs, E&s;quire.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I not been per&s;onally implicated in the late &s;trange pro&s;ecutions for High Trea|&s;on,
<PB N="119" REF="121">I &s;till mu&s;t have contemplated, I hope, with no le&s;s intere&s;t the men who&s;e talents and integrity had fitted them to be the de|fenders of the human race. A &s;en&s;e of duty has obliged me to remark on the mi&s;takes of &s;ome per&s;ons, concenred in the&s;e trials; and the duty of &s;tating the facts which di&s;|play truths of a contrary nature cannot be thought le&s;s urgent. I have no per&s;onal intimacy with either of you; and I certainly differ widely with you both, concerning the principle of coercion, on which law is founded. On this ground, I have &s;ome|times nece&s;&s;arily di&s;approved even parts of the a&s;toni&s;hing defence you made, in favour of the pro&s;ecuted. I think therefore I &s;hall not rationally be &s;u&s;pected of an endeavour to be&s;tow unmerited eulogium on you. Be|&s;ide, as I have already &s;aid, my chief prai&s;e will be a recapitulation of facts.</P>
<P>When I recollect the&s;e facts, I con&s;e&s;s the accumulated ma&s;s excites in me no &s;mall degree of amazement. Braving the cabals of a violent, numerous, and powerful party, whom none but men of fortitude would
<PB N="120" REF="122">have dared to brave, you began labours which, like the a&s;cent of the Alps, as you proceeded &s;hewed that, having climbed mountains, you had mountains &s;till to climb. The notice you had was abrupt, the ca&s;es each a va&s;t chaos of darkne&s;s, and the i&s;&s;ue, perhaps in the opinion of both parties, little le&s;s than an age of happine&s;s or of mi&s;ery to mankind. The indictment, unju&s;t as it &s;urely was by its complicated nature, contained the names of twelve men, to who&s;e individual narratives you were bound to li&s;ten; and not only to exert all your faculties to deduce the unmixed truth from them, but to divine how you might confute and annihilate accu&s;ing fal&s;hood. You had two li&s;ts of upward of four hun|dred per&s;ons, jurymen and witne&s;&s;es, to &s;crutinize; and by this enormous catalogue the lives of your clients and the liberties of the nation were to be decided. The cha|racter of every man who&s;e name it con|tained was to be &s;ifted. The prejudices of jurymen, as they might be conjectured to ari&s;e from the nature of their employments,
<PB N="121" REF="123">declarations, and dependencies, demanded &s;evere inquiry; and the characters, connec|tions, and vices of &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es, an inquiry perhaps &s;till more painful, more di&s;gu&s;ting, more &s;evere. Failure in either of the&s;e e&s;&s;ential points might have been de&s;truction to the great cau&s;e you had ri&s;en to defend.</P>
<P>The nature of the accu&s;ation was &s;till more confounding. It was a ma&s;s of hete|rogeneous facts, vague but perplexing a&s;&s;er|tions, and tedious and &s;tupefying readings and recapitulations. It is now proved, that there was nothing trea&s;onable in them: but their artful and benumbing effects you had to de&s;troy, or freedom had to fall.</P>
<P>To you, Mr. Er&s;kine, truth requires I &s;hould particularly addre&s;s my&s;elf; and the di&s;tinction I know will give no &s;mall plea|&s;ure to your kind and dignified fellow-la|bourer. I &s;aw the tears &s;tart in his eyes, I heard the tremulous &s;inking of his voice, I witne&s;&s;ed the affections working in his bo|&s;om, when he attempted, in his eloquent and animated &s;peech in the defence of Mr.
<PB N="122" REF="124">Thelwall, to expre&s;s his deep &s;en&s;e of your virtue. It was a marking trait in his cha|racter, which tho&s;e who know how to e&s;ti|mate it will not forget.</P>
<P>He then will mo&s;t cordially join with me, when I affirm that the intrepidity with which you encountered an embattled ho&s;t of Crown lawyers, who&s;e angry brows were dark as Erebus, whenever the Bench above them decided that the practice of the courts was in your favour, was &s;uch as I believe no pleader in the kingdom could have equalled; that the acumen with which you examined witne&s;&s;es, Spies I mean and In|formers, extracting truth from the black rece&s;&s;es of audacious fal&s;hood, wre&s;ting it forth and dragging it to light, was no le&s;s admirable; that the di&s;crimination with which you detected and expo&s;ed, even without wounding, the prevarications not of hired ru&s;&s;ians but of infatuated and pre|judiced men, drew applau&s;e even from your adver&s;aries; and that, by your knowledge of the human heart, you &s;o managed the witne&s;&s;es for the Crown as to make the&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="125">very witne&s;&s;es prove the inju&s;tice and the fal&s;hood of the charges brought again&s;t your clients. Various are the traits, in the cour&s;e of the trials, that mark how emi|nently you po&s;&s;e&s;s the qualities I have at|tempted to de&s;cribe. One of the&s;e I cannot forbear to cite. A friend who heard it, and who is well &s;tudied in the human heart, par|ticularly in its great emotions, &s;peaking of it with tran&s;port has declared that, accom|panied by your voice, look, and ge&s;ture, it was &s;ublime. While examining the &s;py Alexander, who had not you detected him might have &s;worn away the life of Hardy, ob&s;erving his downca&s;t countenance and &s;uddenly interrupting your&s;elf, you ex|claimed&mdash; <Q>Look at the Jury, &s;ir! Don't look at me: I have &s;een enough of you!</Q></P>
<P>The exertions of your genius thus far were delightful: and, had they ended here, would I tru&s;t have &s;aved the nation. But here they were not to end. Your &s;peech in favour of Hardy at the clo&s;e of the evidence for the Crown, was &s;uch that
<PB N="124" REF="126">every creature who witne&s;&s;ed it, young and old, never mention it in my hearing but with rapture. Accompanied as it was by that profound &s;en&s;e of the magnitude of the cau&s;e you had to defend, and by that almo&s;t &s;uper-human energy, for &s;uch it is de&s;cribed to have been, with which its mo|mentous con&s;equences in&s;pired you, the words you uttered were engraven on the hearts of your hearers! Their affections were expanded, and they glowed with that divine enthu&s;ia&s;m in the behalf of ju&s;tice, which &s;trength of feeling and genius like yours only could infu&s;e. Sir, you &s;aved a nation; and a nation's tears, a nation's ble&s;&s;ings, a nation's love, will follow you to the grave; and there re&s;t, in everla&s;tingly fond remembrance, over your a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t I forget that you, &s;ir, were the man who&s;e acutene&s;s and genius fitted you for the momentous office; and who&s;e courage alone could re&s;i&s;t ob&s;tacles that terri|fied minds le&s;s firm, and propen&s;ities more &s;elfi&s;h. Sorry am I to learn that the bar is infe&s;ted by a mercenary band, who will not
<PB N="125" REF="127">whi&s;per a word in favour of that freedom which tho&s;e who have &s;ilk gowns and fur|red robes to be&s;tow &s;y&s;tematically di&s;counte|nance. They &s;hun the unprofitable conte&s;t. They af&s;irm, and deny, and cringe, and cower, and blow hot and blow cold, as a nod from the powers that be &s;hall indicate; obedient and tame for a time, that their turn to tyrannize may come. Twelve innocent men might have peri&s;hed, nay a Nation have peri&s;hed with them, ere one man of any &s;tanding or command at the bar would have moved in their defence. you, &s;ir, was the only exception. Your patrioti&s;m alone was pure enough to di&s;regard per|&s;onal views, and momentary advantage. You toiled for a nobler purpo&s;e than to ren|der your children the future &s;atraps of de|&s;poti&s;m. Lighted by the torch of Liberty, you &s;aw the wor&s;hippers of Mammon forg|ing their own &s;hackles. With a mind too ela&s;tic, too independent, too comprehen&s;ive to &s;toop thus ba&s;ely, the &s;ight in&s;pired you with increa&s;ing fortitude; and you met the &s;elect legion of all the Inns and Halls, mar|&s;halled
<PB N="126" REF="128">again&s;t you in dreadful array. They advanced upon you, glorying in their num|bers; now man by man, and now, exa&s;pe|rated at repul&s;e, ru&s;hing forward in a body: You faced and fought them all; with va|lour unequalled, you fought and conquered.</P>
<P>Shall I forget the man who &s;o courageou&s;ly imitated your daring; le&s;s inured to the field, yet eager to &s;hare your dangers? If I do, may my right hand forget her cunning! He participated your toils, he was your brother in anxiety and zeal; and, in lo|gical deduction and clo&s;e rea&s;oning, &s;urely not your inferior. If he did not imperiou&s;ly reign over the &s;en&s;ations, he commanded the a&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tanding. He, like you, had to repel the poi&s;oned arrows of law; and of law it&s;elf you mutually made a &s;hield, by which its terrors were averted.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay? How &s;hall I addre&s;s you? Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a people's love, a peo|ple &s;natched by your aid and the fortitude of a few from the brink of &s;lavery, how &s;hall an individual expre&s;s his &s;en&s;e of your virtues and your worth? Gentlemen, the
<PB N="127" REF="129">triumph you gained and the applau&s;e be|&s;towed upon you was heartfelt, and little le&s;s than univer&s;al. But it was not mo|mentary. No! Ages to come &s;hall re|&s;ound with its acclamations! They will be heard everla&s;tingly: at lea&s;t while the ac|tions of men as they are &s;hall continue to intere&s;t men as they mu&s;t be.</P>

<P>AFTER the examination of the &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;pirators before the Privy.

One of the&s;e I knew was Mr. Sharp; and being convinced, when the trial of Mr. Horne Tooke was over, it was then impo&s;|&s;ible for Con&s;tructive Trea&s;on to make any farther at|tempts upon me, and fore&s;eeing that I &s;hould be called up to be acquitted without trial, I wi&s;hed to deliver the addre&s;s which is in&s;erted in this narrative. That it might produce its full effect, I was de&s;irous of pro|curing the mo&s;t authentic documents. This occa&s;ion|ed me to write the following note:</P>

<LETTER>
<P>Copy from my te&s;timony, which I &s;igned at the Privy Council.&mdash;<Q>The Society for Con&s;titutional Information adjourned and left the Delegates in the room: the mo&s;t gentlemanlike per&s;on (of the Corre&s;ponding Society) took the chair, and talked about an equal repre&s;entation of the people, and put|ting an end to war. Holcroft talked about the powers of the human mind.</Q> This is the whole that I &s;igned. The particulars I remember of that conver&s;ation are I believe nearly as follow: Mr. Holcroft talked a great deal about peace; of his being again&s;t any violent or coercive means, that were u&s;ually re&s;orted to again&s;t our fellow-creatures; urged the more powerful operation of philo&s;ophy and rea|&s;on, to convince man of his errors; and &s;aid, that he would di&s;arm his greate&s;t enemy, by tho&s;e means, and oppo&s;e his fury.&mdash;Spoke al&s;o about truth being powerful, &amp;c. &amp;c. and gave advice to the above effect to the Delegates pre&s;ent, who all &s;eemed to agree, as no per&s;on pre&s;ent oppo&s;ed his arguments. This conver&s;ation la&s;ted better than an hour, and we de|parted. The next time the Delegates met, Holcroft was not pre&s;ent. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of what I re|member of that conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132">
Before the Grand Jury, I mentioned Mr. Holcroft's di&s;po&s;ition and conver&s;ation when we met, about rea|&s;oning men out of their errors. He was a &s;ort of natural quaker, and was for the peaceable means that philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on pointed out, to convince man|kind. He was again&s;t violence of all kinds; but did not believe in the &s;ecret impul&s;es of the Spirit, like the Quakers.</P>
<P>I think it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint my friend Holcroft, that notice will be taken (to oppo&s;e my te&s;timony) of the words that pa&s;&s;ed at my hou&s;e, when I was in cu&s;tody, between the officer and Holcroft&mdash;of his telling the man he was a liar; it was an impudent lie; which occa&s;ioned, I under&s;tand, two men being placed over me the next day, they conceiving it a de&s;ign on our part to affront the man, to produce violence, and favour my e&s;cape. This I believe will be urged by the Coun&s;el for the Crown, to de&s;troy my evidence in Holcroft's favour. Holcroft mu&s;t procure other per&s;ons, who have heard him reprobate war and violence, and oppo&s;e truth, rea&s;on, and philo&s;ophy. I believe Tooke, Godwin, and Adams, mu&s;t remember conver&s;ations to that effect.</P>

<P>The an&s;wer to the la&s;t paragraph may be &s;een, in my letter to the Attorney General. I &s;hall only add, that I very &s;incerely di&s;approve the word liar, or any other word which has an aggravating tendency; and that, if the occa&s;ion on which I u&s;ed that word did not ju&s;|tify the action, I wi&s;h it to meet all the cen&s;ure it de|&s;erves. I have con&s;cientiou&s;ly related the motive with which it was u&s;ed by me.</P>

<P>THE following curious documents were commu|nicated to me, by a gentleman who&s;e accuracy and per&s;picuity in &s;eating facts have been eminently bene|ficial to the cau&s;e of reform, and to whom the Nation is highly indebted for the very e&s;&s;ential part he took in drawing up the &s;tate of the repre&s;entation of England and Wales, which was publi&s;hed by the Society of the Friends of the People. In the following Defence, I have endeavoured to give a &s;ketch of the corruptions of parlia|ment, and have offered &s;ome conjectures on the oligarchi|cal organization which, if not prevented, is likely to re&s;ult. The aunexed documents contain enumerations pointedly in favour of my whole argument. The power of the Crown can only counteract the influence of the Peerage by &s;welling its li&s;t. The Commons is proved to be the creature of their own creating. By weaken|ing each other, they mu&s;t fall; and from their downfall a new order of things mu&s;t in &s;ome form or other ari&s;e, &s;hould the pre&s;ent pertinacious re&s;i&s;tance to innova|tion, that is to a change for the better, be continued.</P>

<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Crime of which I here &s;tand ac|cu&s;ed I con&s;ider as one of the highe&s;t which man can commit. It is the crime of medi|tating and con&s;piring to have recour&s;e to arms and violence: a crime that has the greate&s;t tendency to inflame multitudes, de|prive them of rea&s;on, and excite them to all the horrors of war; which is a &s;tate the mo&s;t de&s;tructive and the mo&s;t unnatural to man. I tru&s;t the Court and the Jury, therefore, will afford me a patient and an attentive hear|ing, while I endeavour to &s;hew the extreme inju&s;tice that has been done me; that I may be re&s;tored to &s;ociety without being deprived of any part of that utility which &s;o inti|mately depends on a character unimpeach|able
<PB N="2" REF="139">and a mind actuated by virtuous in|tention.</P>
<P>Points of Law have already been mo&s;t ably argued; and, if they had not, my &s;tu|dies have not quali&s;ied me to treat of Law in the detail. It is voluminous, complex, and contradictory. Either I mi&s;take, or, it is the very oppo&s;ite to the &s;imple uniformity of Ju&s;tice. And here it is my duty to re|mind you, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the very e&s;&s;ence of your office is to con&s;ider the Ju&s;tice, I &s;ay, the Ju&s;tice of this and of every ca&s;e that comes before you; and, whenever Law is contrary to Ju&s;tice, &s;tudiou&s;ly to pre|&s;erve your minds untainted by its perplex|ities, and unbia&s;ed by its dogmas. I have much to &s;ay; but, remembering that not only my life but the lives of all future men to whom this ca&s;e &s;hall be brought as a pre|cedent are at &s;take, I am per&s;uaded you will not think the duty of li&s;tening to my ex|culpation too &s;evere. Arraigned thus &s;o|lemnly, my defence again&s;t a charge of &s;o deep a dye mu&s;t be no le&s;s &s;olemn.</P>
<P>It is the nature of accu&s;ation to alarm all
<PB N="3" REF="140">&s;ociety, and render the individual accu&s;ed univer&s;ally &s;u&s;pected. The benevolence he u&s;ed to meet is fled from every face; he is avoided; the &s;weets of &s;ocial intercour&s;e are denied; his functions are &s;u&s;pended, his uti|lity is cut off, and his moral exi&s;tence, the power of doing good, is always pal&s;ied, and often de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The effects of accu&s;ation, at this moment, are ten-fold pernicious. The pre&s;ent cri&s;is has produced a degree of acrimony between contending parties, that is pregnant with mi&s;chief: acrimony unexampled perhaps &s;ince the pro&s;cribing days of Sylla and Cae|&s;ar. How is this de&s;olating &s;pirit to be ap|pea&s;ed? Can it be by accu&s;ation, ra&s;hly made, ob&s;tinately continued, and, I will not &s;ay pro&s;ecuted with malignity, but, I mu&s;t &s;ay pro&s;ecuted by all the methods which men have beeen accu&s;tomed to a&s;cribe to that odious principle? What is it, at this fearful moment, that prompts and precipi|tates men to violence? Violence that per|haps may blind them to an approaching ma&s;s of mi&s;ery; and, rendering them furious,
<PB N="4" REF="141">may plunge them in that frantic and pell-mell de&s;truction which we all deprecate, all dread, and all abhor? It is this fatal &s;pirit of acrimony: a &s;pirit which ra&s;hne&s;s engen|dered, pa&s;&s;ion has envenomed, and mutual ob&s;tinacy renders mutually atrocious.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the&s;e are tremendous times! This is a tremendous occa&s;ion! And an un|ju&s;t &s;entence will be followed by tremendous con&s;equences! Not on account of per&s;onal worth; for individuals, taken &s;eparately, are but in&s;ects; on each of which Power might &s;et its foot, and declare them noxious from the want of lei&s;ure and inclination to &s;tudy their u&s;e. No: it is becau&s;e &s;uch unju&s;t de|ci&s;ions tend to increa&s;e that unrelenting ani|mo&s;ity, that &s;avage hatred, which already rages in the public mind.</P>
<P>For my own part, Gentlemen, I will not merely contend that I am innocent, but that I have aimed at being highly virtuous. For this purpo&s;e, I have two principal points to prove:</P>
<P N="1">1. That I was actuated by peaceful mo|tives was the enemy of force; and, con&s;e|quently,
<PB N="5" REF="142">did not compa&s;s or imagine the death of the King, or of any human being. This will prove me guiltle&s;s of the black charge brought again&s;t me.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is the duty of every man, who perceives the mi&s;chiefs re&s;ulting from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of repre&s;entation, to endeavour to effect a reform: and you all know. Gen|tlemen, that a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of duty is the re&s;ult of &s;entiments of virtue.</P>
<P>I know no method that will &s;o effectually convince you how &s;incerely I am the friend of benevolence, and the enemy of coercion, or force, as by detailing the facts and argu|ments by which I have my&s;elf been con|vinced: nor can I by any other means &s;o &s;atisfactorily prove to you how unequivo|cally I am a friend to reform, as by remind|ing you of what the pre&s;ent &s;tate of repre|&s;entation in this kingdom is, and what are its con&s;equences. To the&s;e points then I once more entreat your patient, &s;trict, and con&s;cientious attention.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with coercion: and, as I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to u&s;e the term, I re|que&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="143">you, Gentlemen, carefully to recollect that, by coercion, I mean that force which obliges a man to act or &s;uffer without the con&s;ent, and contrary to the deci&s;ion, of his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>No man I imagine will or can approve coercion, unle&s;s it be intended to prevent crime. We have therefore to enquire, what is crime?</P>
<P>Crime is unju&s;t intention carried into ef|fect.</P>
<P>It is the nature of crime to begin with in|dividuals, but to expand and communicate to the whole. To injure one man is to give an example of injury to all men: violence produces violence; and a fir&s;t vice is followed by a train of vices, the contagion of which quickly infects the whole community.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e the nature of crime to injure him by whom it is committed. It renders him &s;u&s;pected, dreaded, and odious; and he can only be countenanced in proportion as the wicked example he gives is followed: that is, by an increa&s;e of danger to him&s;elf and all mankind. If the injury of which he
<PB N="7" REF="144">is guilty be returned with exce&s;s, we are then accu&s;tomed by compari&s;on to exone|rate him; though in reality his crime is in|crea&s;ed a hundred fold: for, while of two or two millions of crimes his may appear to be the lea&s;t, it is more fatal than any of tho&s;e of which it is the origin. All the crimes of a de&s;tructive war originate with him who fir&s;t conceived that war.</P>
<P>Sel&s;i&s;hne&s;s is emphatically the characteri&s;|tic of crime: for the mi&s;taken man, who does a wrong act with a view to the good of others and without a retro&s;pect to his own, is certainly acting from virtuous intentions. Suppo&s;ing his action to be baneful, his mind has the attribute of virtue.</P>
<P>Since therefore the &s;elfi&s;h criminal com|mits the greate&s;t injury again&s;t him&s;elf, whom he intended to benefit, and the di&s;intere&s;ted criminal is in like manner acting under mi&s;|take, it follows that all crime is error of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Crime therefore is ignorance: which is the ab&s;ence or want of knowledge. Con&s;e|quently, and this is one of the mo&s;t import|ant
<PB N="8" REF="145">of truths, knowledge is the &s;ole means by which crime can be prevented.</P>
<P>If this rea&s;oning be ju&s;t, it follows that to attempt to prevent crime by coercion is an error of the under&s;tanding: or, in other words, is it&s;elf al&s;o crime.</P>
<P>This may be elucidated by an inquiry in|to the nature and con&s;equences of puni&s;h|ment: which is one of the mo&s;t important branches of coercion.</P>
<P>Puni&s;hment is the infliction of pain and di&s;grace; generally &s;peaking, either by the permi&s;&s;ion or at the in&s;tigation of &s;ociety; &s;ometimes purpo&s;ing to reform the criminal, and at others not; for criminals are frequent|ly put to death; but always with an intent to prevent crime.</P>
<P>That to puni&s;h a man for being virtuous would be to commit inju&s;tice needs no proof. Puni&s;hment therefore can only con|cern it&s;elf with real or &s;uppo&s;ed crime.</P>
<P>It has already been proved that all crime is error of the under&s;tanding: and, that,</P>
<P>Knowledge is the &s;ole means by which crime can be prevented. By knowledge is
<PB N="9" REF="146">here under&s;tood moral knowledge; or the communication of tho&s;e facts which teach men to generate happine&s;s and prevent mi|&s;ery. The more we examine the con&s;e|quences of puni&s;hment, the more we &s;hall be convinced how incapable it is of communi|cating this kind of knowledge.</P>
<P>Had puni&s;hment been an effectual means for preventing crime, as &s;oon as puni&s;h|ment had been begun crime mu&s;t have been on the decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>This effect however is not produced; for men continue, from the introduction of pu|ni&s;hment to the pre&s;ent hour, to be impri|&s;oned, pilloried, whipped and hanged.</P>
<P>Fear, fal&s;hood, revenge, and de&s;peration are the vices which puni&s;hment produces; and even revenge and de&s;peration are not &s;o de&s;tructive as fear and fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Fear confu&s;es, di&s;tracts, and debilitates the mind. To prevent crime, we mu&s;t communicate knowledge. Now the thing mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential for the acquirement of know|ledge is that the mind &s;hould be clear, and undi&s;turbed; and, for the practice of the
<PB N="10" REF="147">virtues taught by knowledge, that it &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s fortitude.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the practice of fal&s;hood, it teaches man not only to conceal from others, but from him&s;elf, his various devia|tions from rectitude; and the more &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully he practices this deceit, the more au|dacious and enterprizing he becomes. Let us once more appeal to experience for proof.</P>
<P>What are the effects of puni&s;hment? What but inevitably to create a &s;chool for the exerci&s;e of the arts of fal&s;hood; where the hi&s;tory of its tran&s;actions is read with delight, and repeated for the encouragement and in&s;truction of every novice? Each tale has its hero; arduous ta&s;ks are undertaken; con&s;equences are fore&s;een, and guarded a|gain&s;t; fortitude and pre&s;ence of mind, for the perpetration of crime are cheri&s;hed, and rendered habitual; and plans, connected, daring, and &s;ucce&s;sful, are laid, by which their authors, with only a &s;mall change of circum&s;tances, would have gained immor|tal fame. Such &s;eminaries are our common
<PB N="11" REF="148">jails; and &s;uch are the heroes they daily produce, and daily deliver up, to men paid and authorized to inflict on them varienties of di&s;grace, puni&s;hment, and death. When a man, from the perver&s;ity of his under|&s;tanding, has committed his fir&s;t crime, he is immediately &s;ent to pri&s;on, according to law: that is, Law dooms him to the &s;ociety of men, who&s;e under&s;tandings are in a &s;till more perverted &s;tate than his own. Law, which is emphatically &s;tiled the wi&s;dom of ages, does this! How would common-&s;en&s;e act? Common-&s;en&s;e would in&s;tantly con|&s;ign the criminal to the &s;uperintendence and admonition of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t vir|tuous men the nation could boa&s;t. Men capable of great crimes are, almo&s;t without exception, men of extraordinary energy and enterprize; and &s;uch men, thus bene|volently treated and in&s;tructed, would be|come as active and indefatigable, in good, as they had been daring and re&s;tle&s;s in evil. The criminal would be transformed to the &s;age. Yet even this percicious practice of the law is outdone by the law. A man
<PB N="12" REF="149">need not be criminal to be &s;ent to pri&s;on; he need only be accu&s;ed: and, however in|nocent he may enter, he mu&s;t have more than common virtue if he do not come out guilty. Such is coercion: &s;uch is puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>Puni&s;hment therefore is inef&s;icient: it cannot extirpate crime: this can only be effected by the communication of know|ledge. Hence,</P>
<P>It is the duty of mankind to in&s;truct: but,</P>
<P>It is the practice of mankind to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>To in&s;truct is to increa&s;e the well being of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To puni&s;h is to increa&s;e the mi&s;ery of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence that re&s;ults to &s;ociety is the following:</P>
<P>Inju&s;tice is of a nature &s;o de&s;tructive to well being that men cannot endure it, without endeavours to provide again&s;t it in future. Now, by &s;ub&s;tituting a fal&s;e mode of correction, puni&s;hment, they have lo&s;t &s;ight of the true mode, knowledge; and thus they have lo&s;t what would have been
<PB N="13" REF="150">an ince&s;&s;ant motive with them to propagate that very thing it&s;elf, knowledge, by which alone their well being can be &s;ecured and improved.</P>
<P>The contradictions that &s;pring from the &s;y&s;tem of violence are endle&s;s. In one and the &s;ame breath, the morali&s;t recommends &s;incerity and &s;ecrecy: though no two things can be more incompatible with and de&s;truc|tive of each other. He cla&s;&s;es them among the mo&s;t eminent virtues; though one of them cannot but be a pernicious vice, for they are oppo&s;ites in the extreme. Where &s;ecrecy is &s;incerity cannot be: and where &s;incerity is &s;ecrecy can have no exi&s;tence. Nothing can be more demon&s;trable: for, to &s;peak with perfect &s;incerity there mu&s; be no re&s;erve: but, if only a part of the truth be told, a part mu&s;t be re&s;erved: therefore to &s;peak only a part of the truth is not to &s;peak with perfect &s;incerity.</P>
<P>The virtue of habitual &s;incerity is ea&s;ily proved: for, all men are agreed that to pre|vent inju&s;tice is a virtue: now, inju&s;tice cannot be committed till it be fir&s;t conceived
<PB N="14" REF="151">in thought: therefore, to conceal thought is to conceal that by which the means of preventing inju&s;tice would be mo&s;t effectu|ally &s;upplied.</P>
<P>How contrary to this is the coercive principle of law; which prohibits, by pains and penalties, the publication of thought! Like an odious and a wicked tyrant, it pu|ni&s;hes &s;editious writings; nay, more, &s;edi|tious words: that is, it impo&s;es, under pains and penalties, a &s;y&s;tem of lying, or &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the genuine &s;entiments of our mind; and thus the mo&s;t pernicious of all vices is e&s;tabli&s;hed, by law, a part of our education. Thus men, if they have erro|neous opinions, are forbidden that which alone can procure a remedy for this wor&s;t of di&s;ea&s;es; and thus the venom of fal&s;|hood being forcibly pent up in the mind, lies rankling there; till it bur&s;ts forth with &s;uch pe&s;tilential virulence as not only to de|&s;troy its parent but to infect all &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The farther we pur&s;ue the&s;e inquiries the more we &s;hall be convinced that puni&s;h|ment is the foe of knowledge; is de&s;truc|tive
<PB N="15" REF="152">of liberty; is incompatible with ju&s;|tice; and that it engenders crime, multi|plies mi&s;ery, and murders intellect and its energies according to low.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, what I have &s;aid is but a feeble &s;ketch of this de&s;olating principle; which I cannot contemplate without &s;hud|dering at the mi&s;chief it produces, and feeling how totally inadequate not only my powers but tho&s;e of any exi&s;ting being are to detail its black and bloody annals. It is by relieving my heart of this oppre&s;&s;ive load, by attempting to &s;hew men how mi&s;e|rably they are mi&s;taken, and by zealous and ince&s;&s;ant endeavours to per&s;uade them to benevolence, that I have &s;o wounded their prejudices as to have &s;ubjected my&s;elf to the foul charge with which I here &s;tand disfigured, and at i&s;&s;ue for life or death. Oh could I but worthily treat the grand &s;y&s;tem of Benevolence for which I con|tend, could I but call to your recollection the innumerable facts, with which you are all acquainted, that demon&s;trate its power of increa&s;ing the happine&s;s of man, I &s;hould
<PB N="16" REF="153">then indeed rejoice at the opportunity now afforded me; and, wholly di&s;regarding per|&s;onal danger, &s;hould exult in being the or|gan of Truth and the benefactor of the human race. Unequal however as I feel my&s;elf to a &s;ubject &s;o gigantic, I feel with &s;till &s;uperior force that it is my duty to ex|ecute the ta&s;k to the be&s;t of my ability. I &s;hall endeavour therefore to di&s;cover what true benevolence is, to trace its con&s;equen|ces, and to demon&s;trate their reality.</P>
<P>Benevolence is the very oppo&s;ite of crime: it is ju&s;t intention carried into ef|fect.</P>
<P>I am well aware how &s;trenuou&s;ly the advocates for coercion contend that pu|ni&s;hment is benevolent; and that puni&s;h|ment it&s;elf is ju&s;t intention carried in|to effect. I tru&s;t I have already proved the fal&s;ity of this a&s;&s;ertion; which, if fal&s;e, is rendered fatal by being &s;uppo&s;ed to be true; for, were it not &s;o &s;uppo&s;ed, it could not be endured. Extending the inquiry a little farther, we are obliged to a&s;k what is puni&s;hment, but the infliction of pain?
<PB N="17" REF="154">And does any human being, while &s;uffer|ing pain, contemplate the benevolence of that agent who is exerci&s;ing him&s;elf in in|flicting pain? The &s;troke of the axe, that &s;e|vers the head from the body, certainly brings no &s;uch conviction: as little does the la&s;h of the whip; or the locks, bolts, and bars, that prevent the emaciated and life-weary pri|&s;oner from partaking of that air and exer|ci&s;e which would re&s;tore him to health, freedom, and well being.</P>
<P>The infliction of pain, it is &s;aid, induces the patient to recollect and deeply fix in his memory the mi&s;takes which occa&s;ioned pu|ni&s;hment; and, that he may avoid pain, he will carefully avoid mi&s;take. This is a &s;trange error; for it &s;uppo&s;es that the la&s;h of the whip actually does communicate knowledge. Otherwi&s;e, how is a man whipped enabled better to avoid mi&s;take, in future, than he was before he was whip|ped? The Law indeed includes the ab&s;ur|dity of &s;uppo&s;ing that all men are fully in|formed of all crimes, their tendency, and extent. If it did not, its tyranny would
<PB N="18" REF="155">be hateful even to tho&s;e who at pre&s;ent mo&s;t tenaciou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert its benignity. To prove the error of this fiction would be lo&s;s of time. So voluminous and complex is law that no learned profe&s;&s;or in this court, in this king|dom, or that ever exi&s;ted, can remember its contents: &s;o perplexed are its precepts that they are for ever varying: and &s;o &s;elf|contradictory are its precedents that they have de&s;troyed all certainty; and advo|cates the mo&s;t able, judges the mo&s;t up|right, and juries the mo&s;t con&s;cientious, when once entangled in its intricacies, are in continual danger of exoncrating the vi|cious, and condemning the guiltle&s;s. Why is this High Court now &s;olemnly a&s;&s;embled? Oh mi&s;ery to be remembered! This High Court is now &s;itting, robed in all its &s;olem|nities and all its terrors, not to try me and my fellow victims to this &s;y&s;tem of confu|&s;ion according to any definite and already declared principle; but, to make an ex|periment on the perplexities which Sta|tute Law, Precedent Law, and Con&s;truc|tive Law &s;o amply afford! And on this
<PB N="19" REF="156">rotten thread have the lives of twelve men, for days, and weeks, and months, been pending. If this be ju&s;tice, if this be be|nevolence, if this be not the mo&s;t violent exerci&s;e of the fundamentally erroneous &s;y&s;tem of coercion, I mu&s;t then confe&s;s my|&s;elf utterly ignorant of that ju&s;tice, that benevolence, which I had propo&s;ed to my|&s;elf as the grand guides of human action.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have already had and &s;hall again have occa&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of my defence, to point out abu&s;es that &s;eem &s;o incorporated in &s;ociety that to de&s;troy them will perhaps appear to involve the de&s;truc|tion of &s;ociety it&s;elf. Of the&s;e radical abu&s;es, coercion is the chief; and law, co|ercion, and puni&s;hment, we find to be all parts of a common &s;y&s;tem. Now, though I hope I have demon&s;trated to you that where law, where coercion, where puni&s;h|ment is mi&s;ery mu&s;t be; yet, I &s;u&s;pect that, in thought, you have a&s;ked, with terror mingled perhaps with contempt, <Q>What! would you throw open the pri&s;on doors, and let loo&s;e a torrent of villains,
<PB N="20" REF="157">robbers, and murderers? Is that your be|nevolent your wi&s;e advice?</Q> I an&s;wer, No: and for this plain rea&s;on; becau&s;e mankind, in&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the energy and virtue nece&s;&s;ary to adopt &s;uch a plan, would deem him a madman by whom it &s;hould be propo&s;ed. But I conjure man|kind to examine the principle; and, if puni&s;hment be an evil, to keep this princi|ple continually in view, by which they will be prevented from making new laws for the inflicting of new pains and penalties; and will be prompted to repeal the old, as expeditiou&s;ly as the &s;tate of public in&s;truc|tion will render it &s;afe. Yes, Gentlemen, I requ&s;t you will remember that this is the whole which the reform here in&s;i&s;ted on re|quires. I reque&s;t you to keep in mind that, however far the principles may progre&s;|&s;ively lead, I in&s;i&s;t only on following them, now or at any time, to the limits which the wi&s;e&s;t men in the nation &s;hall deem to be &s;ecure. Do not call me a vi&s;ionary, or an enthu&s;ia&s;t, becau&s;e I affirm that happi|ne&s;s begets happine&s;s; that a fir&s;t good
<PB N="21" REF="158">leads to a &s;econd, a &s;econd to a third, a third to a fourth, and &s;o on everla&s;tingly. Examine whether the principles for which I contend be true; and, if they be, follow truth as far as you can di&s;tinctly perceive it, and clearly comprehend its operations. Do not fear that &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould lead you a&s;tray.</P>
<P>To proceed: What is the ju&s;t inten|tion in which benevolence con&s;i&s;ts; and how is it carried into effect? The ju&s;t in|tention which con&s;titutes benevolence is to increa&s;e the well-being of man; and, in|&s;tead of inflicting, to relieve him from pain. The mode of effecting this intention is by at|tentively inquiring into the nature and cau&s;e of &s;uffering; by alleviating it with every ima|ginable remedy; and by that a&s;&s;uaging con|&s;olation which a kind heart and an intelligent mind alone can afford. How effectual is this lenient balm! How eager is the criminal, who by his mi&s;takes has involved him&s;elf in &s;ufferings, to be relieved after this method! How does he revere, how love the hand that admini&s;ters relief! There is not a man on earth who&s;e heart is &s;o depraved as not
<PB N="22" REF="159">to dilate with plea&s;ure, under the exertions and influence of enlightened benevolence. It is welcomed by the &s;ooli&s;h and the wi&s;e, the wicked and the good. Nature is only lovely under its au&s;pices, and man is ne|ver &s;o con&s;cious of his capacity for vir|tue as when his heart teems with benevo|lence.</P>
<P>For my own part, here I &s;tand: the dag|ger is drawn, the arm uplifted, and the &s;troke aimed at my heart. Is it any want of bene|volence to endeavour to arre&s;t the blow? What matters it to me, whether the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in be a real being, or that imaginary murderer the Law? That phantom, under who&s;e form a hue and cry is rai&s;ed to hunt me to perdi|tion. And what kind of man is it that is dragged to the &s;take, and &s;urrounded with the inflammable faggots of Su&s;picion, Fal&s;e Alarm, and atrocious Calumny? Is it one who is a friend to the force of arms? A preacher of violence? An in&s;tigator to civil war? No; it is a man who&s;e words and actions have been uniformly and &s;trenuou&s;ly combined to propagate peace: a man who, not with the cant of hired hypocri&s;y, but
<PB N="23" REF="160">from the deep conviction of principle, has been warning men again&s;t the horrors of that &s;pirit of per&s;ecution and hatred in which he &s;aw all parties &s;o eager to indulge. Yes, from deep rooted long meditated principle, Benevolence has been my &s;y&s;tem. An un|deviating un&s;haken friend to reform, or I &s;hould not now have held my life in jeo|pardy; but profoundly convinced that every act of force, or violence, is contrary to re|form; contrary to general and individual happine&s;s; and big with de&s;truction to its agents of all parties; the &s;tumbling block of all ages, and to remove which it is the duty of all men to exert every faculty of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Should doubts &s;till be entertained of the truth of the&s;e principles, I have only to re|mark that I imagine it cannot be that you, Gentlemen of the Jury, &s;hould not perceive at pre&s;ent how deeply I, at lea&s;t, am con|vinced of their &s;olidity. I will then leave it with your own con&s;ciences how far it is po&s;&s;ible for a man holding the&s;e principles, ince&s;&s;antly promulgating them as I have done, and in the general tenor of my actions regulating my conduct by them, to compa&s;s
<PB N="24" REF="161">or imagine the death of the king and its con|&s;equences: an act which I never did nor ever can imagine; which, for the rea&s;ons already given, I hold in utter abomination; and which rather than compa&s;s my&s;elf, or connive at in others, if I had a thou&s;and lives I would &s;uffer a thou&s;and deaths.</P>
<P>The principles I have developed, and the witne&s;&s;es who&s;e examination you have heard in proof that I have long held and long acted upon the&s;e principles, cannot I think but be &s;ufficient to convince you, Gentlemen of the Jury, that not the mo&s;t minute taint of trea&s;on can attach it&s;elf to me. But this is not &s;ufficient. I &s;eek to be u&s;eful to man|kind; a large portion of whom will imagine that, though not guilty of trea&s;on, I have been meddling in matters that do not con|cern me. An opinion of this kind has in|duced men, who cannot but be wholly unac|quainted with my character and conduct, to calumniate me in various ways. The New&s;|papers, commonly called mini&s;terial, have heaped obloquy on me and my writings; which, however great may be my mi&s;takes or their defects, have con&s;tantly had the good
<PB N="25" REF="162">of mankind for their object. The&s;e preju|dices have pur&s;ued me in public and in pri|vate; to the Theatre, to the Council-cham|ber, to Pri&s;on, and to Judgment. Yes, Gen|tlemen, &s;ince I have been in pri&s;on, various new&s;papers, by various means, have endea|voured to excite or keep alive tho&s;e prejudi|ces again&s;t me which party &s;pirit alone could generate. Gentlemen, I &s;hould not notice &s;uch trifling, &s;uch mi&s;taken and immoral at|tempts to traduce me, but that you may perceive how nece&s;&s;ary it is that a man, in my &s;ituation, &s;hould come forth, after a trial thus &s;olemn, un&s;potted and fully re&s;tored to his former utility. Yes, thus awfully called upon, it becomes me to a&s;&s;ert, and con&s;equently to prove, that I am &s;omething more than innocent; and that I am now, have been, and, if ju&s;tice be done me, again &s;hall be, actively virtuous. This inevitably requires me to detail to this court, and to the kingdom, what have been my rea&s;ons for concurring with and aiding tho&s;e men who have endeavoured to obtain a reform of parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="163">
Why are my powers thus feeble? Can it be that the &s;ingle word Parliament will not excite in you all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations which have &s;o often rent my bo&s;om, at the fore|&s;ight of evils which &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, if not timely, peaceably, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly puri|fied, mu&s;t produce? Gentlemen, by the love of your children, relations, and friends, by the love of your country, by the love of the human race, I conjure you to li&s;ten patiently, attentively, and I again repeat con&s;cientiou&s;ly, to the momentous truths I am about to &s;tate. The trumpet of alarm has been &s;ounded again&s;t reformers. Hear what reformers have to &s;ay in their own defence.</P>
<P>It is a fact, Gentlemen, of public noto|riety, that a &s;ociety called the Friends of the People; a &s;ociety &s;o honoured in its members and &s;o re&s;pectable for its patri|otic and peaceful exertions that detraction has &s;carcely ventured to tax its purity; I &s;ay, it is well known that this &s;ociety, af|ter a laborious &s;crutiny that will for ever be honourably recorded in the annals of
<PB N="27" REF="164">this country, drew up and publi&s;hed a State of the Repre&s;entation of England and Wales. On this authority they founded a petition, at once firm, decorous, and de|ci&s;ive. The petitioners there &s;tate, in ex|pre&s;s terms, <Q>that the number of repre&s;en|tatives a&s;&s;igned to the different Counties is gro&s;sly di&s;proportioned to their com|parative extent, population, and trade; that the elective franchi&s;e is partially and unequally di&s;tributed; that the right of voting is regulated by no uniform or rational principle; that, by the ancient laws and &s;tatutes of this kingdom, fre|quent parliaments ought to be held; that from the&s;e combined defects ari&s;e tho&s;e &s;cenes of confu&s;ion, litigation, and expence, which &s;o di&s;grace the name of free repre&s;entation; that tumults, di&s;or|ders, outrages, and perjury, are the dread|ful attendants on conte&s;ted elections; that returning officers exerci&s;e di&s;cretion|ary powers with the mo&s;t gro&s;s partiali|ty, and the mo&s;t &s;candalous corruption; that a di&s;puted &s;eat in parliament has been
<PB N="28" REF="165">known to co&s;t one of the parties no le&s;s than fifty thou&s;and pounds; that appeals again&s;t fal&s;e returns are a fre&s;h &s;ource of expence, maintained at the average &s;um to each party of a hundred pounds per day; that the attornies' bill alone of one appeal, which in point of form la&s;ted on|ly two days and in point of fact only &s;ix hours, amounted to nearly twelve hun|dred pounds; that the &s;nameful practices which di&s;grace election proceedings have &s;o loaded the table of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, with petitions for judgment and redre&s;s, that one half of the &s;even years duration of parliament was &s;carcely &s;uf|ficient to &s;ettle who is entitled to &s;it for the other half; that the two gentlemen who &s;at and voted nearly three years, as the repre&s;entatives of the Borough of Stockwell, had procured them&s;elves to be elected by the mo&s;t &s;candalous bribery; that the two gentlemen, who &s;at and voted during as long a period for the Borough of Great Grim&s;tead, had not even been elected.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="166">
Gentlemen, I here cite the language of the petition. But what de&s;erves your mo&s;t &s;erious attention is that the&s;e firm, the&s;e patriotic, the&s;e dignified petitioners did not come with a pompous recapitulation of po|pular a&s;&s;ertions, which &s;ome deny, others a&s;&s;irm, and none had a&s;certained; but they came fully provided with facts, for they add to each accu&s;ing clau&s;e the at once al rming and unan&s;werable &s;entence&mdash; <Q> And this your petitioners are ready to prove.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, this memorable this truth publi&s;hing petition did not &s;top here; it gave a table of parliamentary patronage, containing a li&s;t of Seventy-one Peers and Ninety-one Commoners, with their names at length, who by nomination and influ|ence return three hundred and two mem|bers to the Hou&s;e of Commons!</P>
<P>The total number of members, for Eng|land and Wales, are five hundred and thir|teen; and the decided majority, indepen|dently of the Trea&s;ury members, indepen|dently of twenty-eight members who are
<PB N="30" REF="167">returned by compromi&s;e, independently of forty-five additional members nominated by patronage in Scotland, I &s;ay, the&s;e &s;eventy|one peers and ninety-one commoners, amounting together to one hundred and &s;ixty-two, do them&s;elves alone return a ma|jority of ninety-one. Is there any man who now hears me remind him of the&s;e noon-day facts, and who is yet an enemy to reform? Can rea&s;on be &s;o blinded? Can truth be &s;o powerle&s;s? Can the love of our country and of the general good be &s;o di&s;|tant from the &s;en&s;e and feeling of my con|temporaries?</P>
<P>Do you &s;till doubt, Gentlemen, of the nece&s;&s;ity of a parliamentary reform?</P>
<P>Why do I a&s;k what are or what are not your doubts? The Parliament is it&s;elf both Judge and Party. Yes, &s;trange to tell! Incredible to comprehen&s;ion! When this petition was debated in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, of three hundred and twenty-three members pre&s;ent, only forty-one had the virtue to vote in its favour! To whom then can the men who di&s;cover the mi&s;chiefs
<PB N="31" REF="168">that impend appeal, but to the people? to the general under&s;tanding? Till the tide of public opinion &s;hall become irre&s;i&s;tible, what probability is there that &s;uch a Hou&s;e will reform it&s;elf?</P>
<P>The petition I have cited was pre&s;ented on the 6th of May, 1793; the Friends of the People who pre&s;ented it met on the 25th of the &s;ame month, and in a re&s;olu|tion which they publi&s;hed with their peti|tion there is the following pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<Q>It is not (&s;ay they) a circum&s;tance of little moment, to the cau&s;e of reform, that a petition, &s;tating to the Hou&s;e of Commons it&s;elf &s;uch facts and &s;uch ar|guments, with a direct offer on the part of the petitioners to e&s;tabli&s;h every one of their allegations by &s;ufficient evidence, &s;hould be received without di&s;pute, and recorded for ever on the Votes and Jour|nals of the Hou&s;e. No objection was made to the form or term of the peti|tion; no part of its contents was denied, or even que&s;tioned; the motion to bring up the petition was not oppo&s;ed by any
<PB N="32" REF="169">man; the Hou&s;e heard it di&s;tinctly read; they ordered it to lie on their table, and, after a debate of two days, refu&s;ed to appoint a Committee to take it into con|&s;ideration.</Q>
<P>Such, Gentlemen, was the language of the&s;e hone&s;t petitioners.</P>
<P>Did the con&s;cious rectitude of the Hou&s;e &s;purn at this open attack on its purity? Did it endeavour to an&s;wer charges, that thus proclaimed it corrupt to the very core? Was there any man bold enough to a&s;&s;ert the petitioners were traitors? Gentlemen, I repeat, the Parliament, that could receive, li&s;ten to, and treat, &s;uch a petition in &s;uch a manner, is all but incapable of &s;elf refor|mation. Yet to be aware of this is the fir&s;t &s;tep to trea&s;on; to endeavour to learn whe|ther the nation be or be not de&s;irous that &s;uch a parliament &s;hould be reformed is more trea&s;on; to declare, after inquiring, that there is not &s;ufficient proof, at pre&s;ent, that &s;uch a de&s;ire does actually exi&s;t in the na|tion is triple trea&s;on; to re&s;olve that it were to be wi&s;hed that the nation &s;hould &s;o de|&s;ire
<PB N="33" REF="170">is trea&s;on fourfold; and farther to deter|mine that, as &s;oon as this de&s;ire can by peaceable means be produced, and not &s;ooner, virtuous individuals will then co|operate with the nation, becau&s;e that then parliament cannot refu&s;e its attention, is the very climax of trea&s;on! If this be de|nied, why am I here? For a perception of the gro&s;s abu&s;es I have noticed, and an at|tempt at reform by the&s;e actual gradations, are the &s;um and &s;ummit of my trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Recollect, Gentlemen, the barefaced pro|fligacy with which the traffick for Boroughs is carried on in the open face of day. This traffick is reduced to a &s;y&s;tem; and the traf|fickers have long &s;ince received the appro|priate name of Borough Mongers. You cannot be ignorant, Gentlemen, that, at a general election; the&s;e convenient dealers propo&s;e their ware whole&s;ale, to Govern|ment, at a le&s;s price than it would produce if brought into the public market? And why? By this mode they avoid the fatigue of conte&s;t, &s;hun the danger of pro&s;ecution for bribery, and, which is an infinitely
<PB N="34" REF="171">more hazardous peril, prevent the intro|duction of tho&s;e re&s;tle&s;s reformers into par|liament, who, were they admitted, would endanger the craft. Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians!</P>
<P>The language of our &s;potle&s;s repre&s;enta|tives is as incon&s;i&s;tent as their conduct is de|praved. At one time, while every man out of the hou&s;e is publicly talking of the &s;ale of boroughs, no man in the hou&s;e is permitted to hint at the po&s;&s;ibility of any individual member being capable of &s;uch corrupt prac|tices; or having entered tho&s;e &s;acred walls by means &s;o nefarious. At another, they are them&s;elves prompted, I will not inquire by what motive, to &s;peak out, and "tell the &s;e|crets of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e." Too delicate to point at individuals, they attack the whole. Thus, for example, Mr. Pitt has made three efforts in Parliament to introduce a reform. What was his language to our &s;potle&s;s repre|&s;entatives them&s;elves, in the very la&s;t of the&s;e attempts? The&s;e were his words&mdash; <Q>To conquer the corruption that exi&s;ted in the decayed boroughs he believed gentlemen
<PB N="35" REF="172">would acknowledge to be impo&s;&s;ible. The temptation were too great for poverty to re&s;i&s;t; and the con&s;equence of this cor|ruption was &s;o vi&s;ible that &s;ome plan of reform in the boroughs had clearly be|come ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</Q>&mdash;Again.&mdash; <Q>Could it not be proved that, in this coun|try, e&s;tates &s;o &s;ituated as to command an influence in a decayed or depopulated bo|rough, and to have the power of returning two members to parliament, &s;old for more money than they would have done if &s;itu|ated in any other place? However luxu|riant the &s;oil might be, however productive its harve&s;ts, unle&s;s its harve&s;ts could occa|&s;ionally produce a couple of members its intrin&s;ic value was le&s;s.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e are Mr. Pitt's words!</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I know not what your feel|ings may be, but I own I cannot read a pa&s;|&s;age like this, in which corruption that &s;trikes at the very exi&s;tence of civilized &s;ociety is treated with the wantonne&s;s of wit, without &s;huddering through all my frame! And how does this &s;en&s;ation ri&s;e into horror,
<PB N="36" REF="173">when I further recollect that this Mr. Pitt, the man who thus proclaimed the depravi|ties of the hou&s;e to the hou&s;e it&s;elf and to the whole world, is now the man who is labouring, with the collective ma&s;s of that corrupt power which he once &s;o un&s;paringly expo&s;ed, to dye his hands in the blood of tho&s;e who dare to imitate his example?</P>
<P>What was the leading propo&s;ition in this la&s;t plan of Mr. Pitt for reform? It was, in his own preci&s;e words,&mdash; <Q>to recommend to the Hou&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a fund, for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing the franchi&s;es of &s;uch boroughs as would &s;ell. He knew,</Q> he &s;aid (&s;atirically addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to our uncontaminated parliament, as if fearful of wounding its con&s;cientious &s;en|&s;ibility) <Q>he knew there was a &s;ort of &s;queami&s;h and maiden coyne&s;s about the hou&s;e, in mentioning this &s;ubject. They were not very ready to talk, in that hou&s;e, on what at the &s;ame time it was pretty well under&s;tood, out of doors, they had no great objection to; namely, to nego|tiate the purcha&s;e and the &s;ale of &s;eats.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="174">
With what countenance can Mr. Pitt, after this, meet the men for who&s;e blood he has &s;o eagerly &s;ought? There is but one odious an&s;wer: he is a Prime Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>What degree of practice is nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e our &s;elf-approving repre&s;entatives, in the dictatorial tone of a&s;&s;umed virtue, to de|claim on the purity of their collective body; and, if any man unprotected by their &s;acred walls &s;hall dare to que&s;tion the honour of that hou&s;e, tax its integrity, or impeach its proceedings, overwhelm him with all their vengeance?</P>
<P>And how does this integrity exhibit it|&s;elf? By a public avowal of the flagitious traffick.

<P>The Borough of Gatton, within the&s;e two years, was publicly adverti&s;ed for &s;ale by auction. Ob&s;erve, Gentlemen, not &s;old for a &s;ingle parliament; but the fee &s;imple of the Borough, with the power of nominating
<PB N="38" REF="175">the two Repre&s;entatives for ever. On the day of &s;ale, the celebrated auctioneer &s;carcely noticed the value of the e&s;tate.

<Q>On Tue&s;day la&s;t, the 30th September, the annual Mayor's Fea&s;t at We&s;tbury was held, when an elegant and &s;ump|tuous entertainment was provided; at which, in addition to the numerous and very re&s;pectable attendance of the Gen|tlemen of the Borough and neighbourhood, the Earl of Abingdon and Mr. E&s;twick, one of the members, were pre&s;ent. Af|ter dinner many loyal and con&s;titutional toa&s;ts were drank; &s;uch as&mdash;<HI>The King and Con&s;titution&mdash;The Queen and all the Royal Family&mdash;Succe&s;s to his Maje&s;ty's arms,

<Q><P>Gentlemen,</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I ri&s;e, to return you my be&s;t thanks for the honour you have done me, in drinking my health with &s;o much approbation, I hope you will not think it a piece of vanity in me if I &s;hould flat|ter my&s;elf that my conduct, toward the Borough of We&s;tbury, has in &s;ome de|gree at lea&s;t rendered me not unde&s;erving your favour; for, gentlemen, let me tell you (what I tru&s;t, however, you are not unacquainted with) that, although <HI>by the Con&s;titution</HI> of the Country and the Laws of the land, I have <HI>an intere&s;t</HI> in the repre|&s;entation of this Borough for returning the members who are to &s;erve in Parlia|ment, I have never made u&s;e of that in|tere&s;t in any way whatever for my own advantage; but always in &s;uch manner
<PB N="42" REF="179">as I thought would be mo&s;t and be&s;t for the &s;ecurity of your <HI>Rights and Liberties!</HI> and for the <HI>benefit</HI> of the public at large. Other men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>&s;uch</HI> an intere&s;t might have converted it, <HI>as we know,</HI> to their own ambition as well as to their private emolument&mdash;I have done nei|ther; but on the contrary no member has ever been &s;uffered to be at one &s;hil|ling expence for his election; hav|ing cheerfully borne that expence my|&s;elf, in order to render them more true to their tru&s;t. That <HI>I have been deceived</HI> in &s;ome of the members is true; but this is their fault, and not mine: in others I have, thank God, had the &s;atisfaction of knowing that <HI>I have not been deceived;</HI> particularly in one who is now pre&s;ent. I mean my friend Mr. E&s;twick; who, having invariably made the Con&s;titution of the Country the law of his Parliamen|tary conduct, as he has merited &s;o I am per&s;uaded he will continue to de&s;erve the &s;uffrage of the Borough of We&s;tbury; and, having &s;aid this, let me now give
<PB N="43" REF="180">you a toa&s;t, Gentlemen&mdash;<HI>Pro&s;perity to the free! independent! and incorrupt! Bo|rough of We&s;tbury.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, what &s;hall we &s;ay? Is this England? Do we really &s;ee the &s;un? Does its light &s;hine upon us?</P>
<P>Let me however be well under&s;tood: it is not again&s;t the Earl of Abingdon that I would in&s;inuate the mo&s;t di&s;tant blame. He it is true nominates, ob&s;erve, Gentle|men, nominates, the two members for We&s;tbury: but his per&s;ua&s;ion evidently is that this &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation is vir|tuous! and, granting this &s;trange &s;uppo&s;i|tion, his mode of acting and &s;incerity in &s;peaking are what every hone&s;t heart mu&s;t applaud. No! It is the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf, it is the &s;tage of audacious corruption, it is the open infamy at which it is arrived, that a&s;toni&s;h and confound!</P>
<P>No man yet has been able to calculate either the political or moral con&s;equences of this &s;y&s;tem: they are beyond the pow|ers of calculation. Of &s;uch however as I have at pre&s;ent any definite perception I
<PB N="44" REF="181">will endeavour to give you a feeble ab|&s;tract.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t reque&s;t you con&s;tantly to recollect, that, one hundred and &s;ixty-two per&s;ons return a decided majority of ninety-one in the repre&s;entation of England and Wales only. Can you, Gentlemen, can the nation be acquainted with this, and remain ignorant that the real government of the country is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one hundred and &s;ixty-two per&s;ons? At pre|&s;ent, the&s;e per&s;ons, or an efficient number of them, are bought by what is called the executive government; but, as their power is ab&s;olute, their price is enormous. To pay this price an enormous e&s;tabli&s;hment is inevitable: for the&s;e hundred and &s;ixty-two per&s;ons are a &s;pecies of petty Princes; who each has his retainers, his train of depen|dents, his agents, without who&s;e influence and aid his own power would be null; and for all the&s;e provi&s;ion mu&s;t be made. Of all others the pool of corruption is the mo&s;t prolific: agency begets agency, till the noxious brood infects every office, every
<PB N="45" REF="182">department, every &s;tation of life. From the peer to the exci&s;eman, from the prime mi|ni&s;ter to the pari&s;h beadle, agents, depen|dents, creatures, and the creatures of crea|tures are every where &s;warming. The in|crea&s;e of them is ince&s;&s;ant; and the machine becomes &s;o complicated, &s;o mi&s;chievous in its action, and &s;o hopele&s;s of repair, that even tho&s;e who think them&s;elves mo&s;t be|nefited by its vices glance at it with terror, and are panic-&s;truck at the picture.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this is a &s;tate that is impo&s;&s;i|ble to be durable. It will &s;oon be found that carrion &s;ufficient for the kennel cannot be procured: and the pack will then devour their keepers; if not prevented by another con&s;equence, which I am about to &s;tate.</P>
<P>One hundred and &s;ixty-two per&s;ons re|turn a decided majority to the Hou&s;e of Commons. Gentlemen, it is the want of organization, only, that prevents the&s;e hun|dred and &s;ixty-two per&s;ons from openly &s;eizing the power of which they po&s;&s;e&s;s the reality: and, &s;hould the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem con|tinue, this organization mu&s;t inevitably fol|low
<PB N="46" REF="183">and the&s;e per&s;ons who have already &s;eized the legi&s;lative, will as inevitably po&s;|&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the executive govern|ment.</P>
<P>Gentlement, if I under&s;tand the intentions of government at pre&s;ent, they are wholly bent on keeping things as they are. But they are attempting an impo&s;&s;ibility. We know of nothing that is not &s;ubject to change; and the only alternative we have is to better or wor&s;e. If we dare look at facts, and are not entirely blinded by our prejudices, we &s;hall confe&s;s that the changes with which the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem is pregnant have a general tendency to the wor&s;e: and it appears to me to require no great depth of political &s;agacity to foretell that, if we per|&s;i&s;t in rejecting reform, or in other words a change for the better, one of the&s;e con&s;e|quences mu&s;t follow. Either the hundred and &s;ixty-two Peers and Commoners, who now po&s;&s;e&s;s the reality of government, will di&s;cover their collective &s;trength, and orga|nize it to the de&s;truction of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem: or, &s;hould tho&s;e contentions that
<PB N="47" REF="184">have hitherto divided them &s;till continue, a degree of corruption and taxation mu&s;t re|&s;ult, that would end in de&s;poti&s;m: or, which is in&s;initely the mo&s;t probable, and again&s;t which I &s;incerely believe our pre&s;ent mi&s;ta|ken rulers wi&s;h to guard, did they but know how, the people will become &s;o indig|nant, by the evils they will feel, and which are too gro&s;s entirely to e&s;cape the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ig|norance, that they will bur&s;t into that wild riot and &s;avage fury in which, by &s;imilar cau&s;es, the people of France have &s;o lately been plunged.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I repeat, change there mu&s;t be; for the better, or the wor&s;e. Yet the word innovation is continually bewildering our under&s;tandings. And what is this phantom, Innovation, with which we have been haunted till our fears have entire|ly overwhelmed our di&s;cernment? Is there any man &s;o blind as not to know that inno|vation is inevitable? Why do our Statute|books annually &s;well with innovation? Judge Black&s;tone tells us that the&s;e books contained, when he wrote, one hundred and &s;ixty &s;tatutes; the penalty
<PB N="48" REF="185">of which was death, without benefit of clergy. Judge Black&s;tone wrote in the year 1765; and in the indignation of his heart called it a dread&s;ul li&s;t; which, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;ed the number of of|fenders: yet the undeviating practice of the Hou&s;e of Commons is almo&s;t annually to multiply the number of penal &s;tatutes which inflict this horrid and mo&s;t iniquitous puni&s;hment of death. Is not this innova|tion? What! we may be allowed to hang each other, as frequently as we plea&s;e? But to attempt to correct our abu&s;es is trea&s;on! And trea&s;on again demands capital puni&s;h|ment! Nay, to put the matter in a &s;till more &s;hocking point of view, we thus are taught that our wi&s;e and humane repre&s;entatives will pa&s;s act after act, to take away the for|tunes, liberties, and lives of their con&s;titu|ents; but not one to correct that abominable corruption for which, if men could de&s;erve hanging,&mdash;No, no: I will not &s;ini&s;h my &s;entence. Men cannot de&s;erve death. They de&s;erve our aid, our in&s;truction, our love. And, if &s;o, mu&s;t not humanity blu&s;h at the &s;anguinary pages, which the&s;e im|peccable
<PB N="49" REF="186">legi&s;lators, each time they meet, con&s;ult how they may render more &s;an|guinary?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the&s;e Commons vote taxes; the&s;e Commons vote exci&s;e laws; the&s;e Commons vote lottery-bills; the&s;e Com|mons vote &s;tatutes to hang you; and the&s;e Commons vote armies, to carry the whole of their votes into execution. Your &s;afety, your liberty, your lives are not in your own keeping; but in the keeping of an Oligarchy of one hundred and &s;ixty-two peers and commoners. All that is dear to you does not depend on that ju&s;tice which is the emanation and the pride of rea&s;on; but it depends on Yes and No: and to deny that Yes and No are argument, ju&s;|tice, and happine&s;s, is Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The difficulty of rai&s;ing &s;upplies, in or|der to drag heavily forward the unwieldy ark, which cracks in every joint and threatens de&s;truction to &s;hamele&s;s vice that dances naked around it, I &s;ay, this diffi|culty is &s;o great that means which are at once the mo&s;t offen&s;ive to the feelings of
<PB N="50" REF="187">the people, and the mo&s;t pernicious to their morals, are inevitably adopted. What is more execrated, or more execrable, than a lottery-bill? which annually receives the &s;olemn &s;anction of King, Lords, and Com|mons, for trade&s;men to cheat their credi|tors, &s;ervants and apprentices to rob their ma&s;ters, children to pilfer their parents, the poor to pawn the very rags that con|ceal their nakedne&s;s, and the whole nation to gamble with the expre&s;s encouragement of law! Gentlemen, this is an act of &s;uch incredible error, that, though we know it to be true, we are tempted to doubt if it can exi&s;t! What! King, Lords, and Com|mons join in &s;olemnly enacting a law, that authorizes and &s;timulates to &s;uch innume|rable vices? King, Lords, and Commons do this! It is fal&s;e! No man will believe it! No man dare a&s;&s;ert it! It were a million of trea&s;ons to imagine them guilty of mi&s;takes &s;o palpable and &s;o pernicious! Gentlemen, my heart aches, it bleeds, and has bled in &s;ecret ten thou&s;and times, at the dreadful recollection! Does it require the gift of
<PB N="51" REF="188">prophecy to foretell that the political con|&s;equences of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of political mo|rality mu&s;t be &s;ocial de&s;truction? The re|medy is at hand; gentle, gradual, and peaceful reform. But they will neither take nor admini&s;ter the nece&s;&s;ary medicine. No: to offer them the &s;anative draught is Trea&s;on!</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am here upon life and death. This is no time for me to &s;often down Truth till it a&s;&s;ume the gui&s;e of Fal&s;ehood; and, if it be, I will not accept of life upon &s;uch terms. I pity the mi&s;|takes of men, and I have already declared it to be my creed that the wor&s;t of crime is but error of the under&s;tanding: yet I own my&s;elf utterly a&s;toni&s;hed, at the in|con&s;i&s;tency of tho&s;e men who were them|&s;elves the bolde&s;t inquirers, in the year 1783, into the crying abu&s;es that threaten the &s;tate with ruin; and who, in the year 1794, could in&s;titute a pro&s;ecution again&s;t an individual of my principles for High Trea&s;on! But vain is the warning voice; though one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead, they
<PB N="52" REF="189">will not be per&s;uaded: Yet again and again I will exclaim to them, Beware of the hundred and &s;ixty-two! Beware of the Oligarchy! Beware of iron-handed De&s;po|ti&s;m! Beware of gore-&s;treaming Civil War! Have pity on the people, have pity on your&s;elves, and REFORM! And, if this be trea&s;on, welcome DEATH! I am ready.</P>
<P>Well! I am a traitor; and I con&s;pire with other traitors, who meditate plans of reform.</P>
<P>Oh could this traitor but detail the fear|ful facts, could he indeed rou&s;e you to a &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;chief that our political er|rors engender, and which are &s;o fatally fa|miliarized to us that even while they are &s;een they are not ob&s;erved, there is not a man that hears him who would not in|&s;tantly exclaim, as I do, Reform! Reform! Reform! But, I feel my powers wholly unequal to the effort.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;trange to think! we daily &s;ee public &s;en&s;ibility &s;o morbid, to national and to general happine&s;s, as to te&s;tify di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction
<PB N="53" REF="190">for the want of news, if &s;ome dreadful battle have not been fought, &s;ome mi&s;erable city laid in ruins, &s;ome province inundated, or &s;ome country not &s;uffering all the horrors of famine: and all the&s;e horrors created by the de&s;tructive errors of Prime Mini&s;ters, Lords, and Commons. Oh! welcome death, indeed, when I &s;hall behold this, and not dare to proclaim the vice! or when I &s;hall tremble to pronounce Famine, Prime Mini&s;ters, Lords and Com|mons in the &s;ame breath. Should they be offended, my an&s;wer is ready: <HI>REFORM!</HI> Hang draw and quarter me, if you plea&s;e; but Reform!</P>
<P>An Empre&s;s, but lately, &s;ent her blood|drenched hell hounds to ma&s;&s;acre thirty thou&s;and defencele&s;s per&s;ons, in the city of I&s;mael! An Empre&s;s! The dreadful tale was &s;tated in our daily papers as a com|mon occurrence, and read with infinitely le&s;s emotion than would have been excited by a paragraph of a &s;ingle dome&s;tic mur|der. With this Empre&s;s, who had made treaties in the name of the Holy Trinity
<PB N="54" REF="191">with the Poles, our mini&s;ters al&s;o made reaties; and in the name of the Holy Tri|nity. To more treaties, with more Impe|rial Maje&s;ties, Kings, Potentates, and Prin|ces who had human butchers ready trained to &s;laughter human beings, and bring them to the &s;hambles of Ari&s;tocratical, Princely, and Imperial vengeance, the name of the Holy Trinity was again and again invo|ked. The treaties were made, and the dogs of war unlea&s;hed. Rape, fire, and &s;word were in&s;ufficient; red-hot balls too lenient: fraud, forgery, and famine, mu&s;t &s;well the hell-born troop. Swind|ling fraud, and whole&s;ale forgery mu&s;t combine, under the &s;anction of treaties proclaimed in the name of the Holy Tri|nity. Famine, Oh God! Oh God! De|vouring famine mu&s;t ha&s;ten, in the name of the Holy Trinity, to the de&s;truction of twenty-five millions of men! And &s;hall this I&s;mael Heroine, this thirty thou&s;and &s;ouled Empre&s;s, &s;hall the&s;e Holy Trinity Prime Mini&s;ters, &s;hall the&s;e fraud, forgery, and Famine Potentates not hear of their
<PB N="55" REF="192">horrors? Will a nation, thus implicated in the&s;e infamous tran&s;actions, know the&s;e things and be &s;ilent? Or &s;hould they, have not twenty-five millions of men one tongue among them, to publi&s;h the black narrative?</P>
<P>To whom do the&s;e twenty-five millions of men attribute the murders of the guillo|tine, the ma&s;&s;acres of Lyons, the deva&s;|tations of La Vend&eacute;e, and the unheard of mi&s;eries to which France for the&s;e two years has been a witne&s;s; and to all of which, wonderful to relate, &s;he is ri&s;ing &s;u|perior? To whom but to Brun&s;wick, Pitt, and Cobourg? Names held there in more univer&s;al abhorrence than ever were tho&s;e of Caligula and Nero.</P>
<P>Gentlement, I know not how to make my&s;elf under&s;tood. While &s;eeking to bring to your recollection the iniquities that error begets, I feel my&s;elf u&s;ing the language to which the pa&s;&s;ions, the mi&s;eries, and the mi&s;takes of men have given birth. I may &s;eem to fo&s;ter a malignity again&s;t individuals, of which I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly
<PB N="56" REF="193">prote&s;t I am not con&s;cious in my heart. May the greate&s;t good that can befall man &s;uddenly be theirs! May they awa|ken to a &s;en&s;e of the ruin they have occa|&s;ioned, and be freed from tho&s;e errors of the under&s;tanding which have been the origin of all their crimes! This is all the harm I either do or ever can wi&s;h to man; and may this harm, if it be harm, be mine! I plead to convince you of the nece&s;&s;ity of reform, and of the deep and everla&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion which this nece&s;&s;ity has made upon my mind. Yes, gentlemen, if to en|deavour at reform be trea&s;on, pronounce me guilty at once. Sweep &s;uch a mi&s;ta|ken wretch from the face of the earth, and let him vex the world no more; for while I live and while I can di&s;cover error, I mu&s;t and will warn mankind to reform.</P>
<P>Some few of the political and moral con|&s;equences of our parliamentary depravity I have enumerated: but who can enumerate them all? "I have bought you, and I will "&s;ell you," is the proverbial language of our immaculate members. Put the que&s;|tion
<PB N="57" REF="194">home to your con&s;ciences, gentlemen: what can be the morality of the&s;e buyers? What the morality of the bought? What &s;en&s;e of moral dignity, what degree of ho|ne&s;t determined &s;incerity, what quantity of di&s;intere&s;ted rectitude, can either po&s;&s;e&s;s? The&s;e repre&s;entatives are ince&s;&s;antly bu&s;ied in making laws: nor is there a &s;tatute that they pa&s;s in which the happine&s;s of the na|tion is not mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly involved. On this happine&s;s their attention ought to be un&s;hakenly fixed; the good of mankind their uniform and &s;ole motive. A&s;k your|&s;elves, gentlemen, is this the purpo&s;e, can this be the motive, of men who accept their &s;eats on the vile condition of voting as their patron &s;hall plea&s;e; who enter the hou&s;e without having con&s;idered any que&s;|tion, yet pre-determined to decide on all? Are &s;uch men the moral mongers of the nation?</P>
<P>What are the effects produced by the in&s;titutes of which men are at pre&s;ent &s;o tenacious? Why, the&s;e in&s;titutes confine the poor to continual labour; by which they
<PB N="58" REF="195">are wholly deprived of lei&s;ure. The&s;e in|&s;titutes fix them in a degree of want, that precludes them the benefit of common ne|ce&s;&s;aries. The&s;e in&s;titutes impel them to &s;eek relief from their mi&s;eries in that for|getfulne&s;s which inebriety promotes. The&s;e in&s;titutes &s;timulate them to pil&s;er, by rob|bing them of the enjoyments in which their lawgivers riot. The&s;e in&s;titutes teach them &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, by convincing them that, if they do not hoard, they mu&s;t &s;tarve. The&s;e in|&s;titutes inculcate and habituate them to re|venge, by inflicting puni&s;hment and vio|lence, as the only mode which the&s;e in&s;ti|tutes know of correcting mi&s;take.</P>
<P>It has often been affirmed that the poor are incorrigible. Gentlemen, there is a melancholy and heart-rending truth lurking under this, in other re&s;pects, abominable a&s;|&s;ertion. There is no law of mind which renders a poor man le&s;s capable of virtue than a rich: nor, indeed, are his vices half &s;o numerous, or half &s;o odious. No; it is not a law of mind; but if I may be allowed the figure, it is the law of no mind; the law
<PB N="59" REF="196">of ignorance; which is impo&s;ed upon the poor by the labour and the wretchedne&s;s to which they are reduced.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the mi&s;chiefs of poverty are, not that it deprives the poor of the trap|pings and fooleries of the luxurious rich; but, that it robs them of their time, as well as of the means of acquiring knowledge. It is knowledge alone that can render the heart beneficent, the head comprehen&s;ive, and the whole man wi&s;e and virtuous. To rob man of knowledge is to be guilty of the wor&s;t of crimes; and of this crime I boldly accu&s;e our lawgivers, our non-reforming re|pre&s;entatives, our oligarchical one hundred and &s;ixty-two.</P>
<P>And well it is that I am &s;peaking here, in this open court, where I have too many hearers, and too hone&s;t, to admit of mi&s;interpretation: for, were I ad|dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf in a &s;mall room, to eight or ten per&s;ons, with but half the freedom and the energy which here are virtue, it would there be trea&s;on. One of the ten would be a &s;py and an informer; who would alter and tran&s;po&s;e and clip and carve my &s;en|tences,
<PB N="60" REF="197">to fit the trea&s;onable model his em|ployers had provided. Thus, &s;hould I hap|pen to mention that forty of the Tower guards had one day marched to the tunes of Ca ira and La Carmagnole, he would forget what was convenient for a &s;py not to remember; and, u&s;ing my own words arranged after his own ingenious method, and with as little interpolation as can be ex|pected from a &s;py, would &s;wear that I and forty Carmagnoles were to march to the tune of Caira and guard the Tower. Yes; he would &s;wear the&s;e were my very words: and his con|&s;cience would exult in the literal hone&s;ty of its cunning. Such would certainly be my danger, were I uncon&s;ciou&s;ly in the com|pany of the&s;e documented and dre&s;&s;ed up gentlemen, whom no man now knows how to avoid. Nay I will not affirm that even this High Court at this moment is not con|taminated by their pre&s;ence. Mi&s;erable &s;y&s;|tem, which cannot exi&s;t without &s;uch &s;up|porters! And tenfold mi&s;erable, when it has arrived at that degree of open infamy as to induce a tribunal of ju&s;tice to &s;creen
<PB N="61" REF="198">its promoters, under the pretence that &s;tate &s;ecrets are not to be divulged.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I pretend to no &s;upernatural powers; I am neither prie&s;t nor prophet, Levite nor Reevite; yet this I dare venture to foretell, that, when we have reform, we &s;hall not have &s;pies. What a &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence is that in which brother &s;u&s;pects brother, &s;ervants are bribed to betray their ma&s;ters, and a&s;&s;ociations are planned in every pari&s;h for the avowed purpo&s;e of pay|ing &s;pies and informers! I would not, it is true, be guilty of trea&s;on or of &s;uicide to rid my&s;elf of &s;uch wretches; but, rather than walk the &s;treets in fear of them, rather than dread they &s;hould haunt me in coffee-hou&s;es, glide before me into all public places, and even &s;tart up by my own fire-&s;ide to appal me, I would &s;uffer all that their employers and payma&s;ters, Prime Mini&s;ters, Lords, Commons, A&s;&s;ociators, and Recvites, could inflict.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;eem to my&s;elf to have &s;trangely deba&s;ed the dignity of my &s;ubject, even though that &s;ubject be the corruption
<PB N="62" REF="199">of parliament, by thus dipping into its very dregs; but, when we recollect the poi&s;on that the&s;e dregs engender, poi&s;on which envenoms the whole &s;tate of &s;ocial exi&s;tence, infu&s;es it&s;elf into every heart, and there broods &s;u&s;picion, hatred, perjury, and rancour only fit for fiends, it then may &s;urely help to fix more deeply in your me|mory the nece&s;&s;ity of peaceful reform; and a conviction that the man, who could &s;ee only the few mi&s;chiefs I have detailed, was not guilty of trea&s;on, when he endeavoured to procure that reform without which de|&s;truction mu&s;t overtake us all.</P>
<P>Examine the moral con&s;equences of your Exci&s;e laws. The &s;ecurity in which recti|tude indulges is lo&s;t, among tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to them. Su&s;picion, a de&s;ire of furtive concealment, hypocri&s;y, cunning, and perjury become their inmates. We &s;carcely find an in&s;tance in which the&s;e per|&s;ons do not openly proclaim their hatred of that government which has rendered them &s;ubject to &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What are the per&s;ons who immediately &s;ee
<PB N="63" REF="200">the&s;e laws carried into execution? Are they not men &s;tigmatized and obnoxious to com|munity? And how does the law treat them? It allows them a poor &s;tipend, and commits to them a dangerous and a tempting tru&s;t. It &s;timulates them to break their oaths, rob their employer, forfeit their character, and in every re&s;pect render them&s;elves the con|tempt of &s;ociety. Yet the&s;e are compara|tively petty evils: the Exci&s;e Laws mu&s;t be encouraged, no matter at what expence of public morality; and all the vices which the brawls, ob&s;cenity, and filth of gin &s;hops can breed mu&s;t not only be endured but promoted.</P>
<P>The&s;e Exci&s;e Laws are &s;welled to a mon&s;trous bulk. In general, they are parts and parcels of other acts, in the body of which they are in&s;erted, and lie &s;o &s;cattered through the &s;tatutes at large that the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of government have found it ex|pedient to collect them, and to add a copi|ous index. I never &s;aw the book; it is a trea&s;ure re&s;erved only for the initiated: for Commi&s;&s;ioners, or men high in office in
<PB N="64" REF="201">the Exci&s;e. It is printed for their u&s;e, at the expence of government; and every offi|cer, entru&s;ted with a copy, is obliged to give a bond of two hundred pounds to re|turn the book, when demanded. It con|tains all the parts of a plan which the con|trivers of it dread &s;hould be in&s;pected. The trader, who is &s;ubject to the&s;e laws, may &s;earch the &s;tatutes at large; and di&s;co|ver how he may pay due obedience to them, if he can. The Philo&s;opher, a &s;till more noxious animal to a &s;tate&s;man, may wade through the mire of the&s;e &s;tatutes at large, and wa&s;te a life in reading acts of parliament, that he may make tho&s;e extracts from each act which relate to the Exci&s;e, the mi&s;chiefs of which it is his duty and his de&s;ire to make public. But &s;o it is. Government, in all ca&s;es, &s;eems to place its &s;ecurity in the ignorance of the governed; and there is no creature that it hates &s;o much or flies with &s;uch antipathy and panic terror as from an enquirer. He will detect its errors: and its errors and its exi&s;tence are &s;uppo&s;ed, by it&s;elf, to be &s;o interwoven
<PB N="65" REF="202">as inevitably to live and die together. If it did not &s;o &s;uppo&s;e, the que&s;tion of the li|berty of the Pre&s;s could never have been &s;tarted, men of enquiry could not have been nicknamed in order to be hunted down, and an advocate of peaceful reform could not have &s;tood at this bar, arraigned for High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>How can I quit this &s;ubject, this nece&s;|&s;ity of reform? Imagination conjures up the picture of a general election, when the whole kingdom affords a tumultuous &s;cene of depravity &s;uch as every friend of man &s;hrinks from with angui&s;h! Impelled by a torrent which he cannot re&s;i&s;t, the wi&s;e and good man yields, and, oh fatal nece&s;&s;ity! becomes an actor in it. But &s;urely, Gen|tlemen, it is not Cimmerian darkne&s;s with us! it is not total eclip&s;e! What! Can the wi&s;e and good man be a &s;pectator of drunk|enne&s;s, bribery, perjury, bludgeon men, and murder, and not know they exi&s;t? Who can have a full image and conception of the feelings of tho&s;e great, good, and noble minded men, who, from a firm &s;en&s;e
<PB N="66" REF="203">of duty, and, which may &s;eem more pa|radoxical, an unbounded love of the mad wretches whom they could not guide, have been compelled to be the principal actors in the&s;e loath&s;ome and lunatic tragedies?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in vain do I toil to fill up a picture the mi&s;eries of which are endle&s;s. I abandon it in de&s;pair! I leave it to the faithfulne&s;s of your own memories: I re|&s;ign it to the general feelings of mankind. Its tendency is too evident for me to fear that its mi&s;chievous properties will not daily become more and more vi&s;ible. The wi&s;h at pre&s;ent neare&s;t to my heart is that tho&s;e who have the power to begin reform may &s;uddenly have the will; and that they will no longer in&s;ult the public, by exerci&s;ing the wor&s;t arts of the wor&s;t of times, to &s;tigmatize the friends of the human race through the medium of an accu&s;ation for high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>And here, Gentlemen, implicated as I am in the&s;e legal a&s;perities, it is my duty to call your attention, now, and the attention of mankind, hereafter, to that abominable
<PB N="67" REF="204">law record an indictment. In language the mo&s;t virulent, this calumniating in&s;tru|ment deforms the &s;weet a&s;pect of a well &s;pent life, and, by its a&s;&s;ertions, changes the fair face of virtue to the black and hideous vi&s;age of a fiend. It does not inquire if a brother have done wrong; a mi&s;taken brother, whom it benevolently intends to benefit; but, bur&s;ting into all the rage of pa&s;&s;ion, it accu&s;es blindfold, and de&s;cribes him who had before been thought a man of virtue as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by vices that would di&s;grace a demon. It practi&s;es acknowledged fal&s;ehoods, which its fabricators call fictions; and, plunging its object in a torrent of legal venom, then leaves the poor &s;uffocated wretch to e&s;cape and purify him&s;elf as he can.</P>
<P>Feeling, as I did, that I had de&s;erved well of my country, knowing how ince&s;&s;antly I had laboured to di&s;cover and, though fre|quently erroneous, to practi&s;e virtue, what were my emotions while I li&s;tened to the monotonous gabble of &s;uch an unintelli|gible and &s;landerous jargon! Did I ever,
<PB N="68" REF="205">&s;aid I, imagine I &s;hould live to hear abu&s;e &s;o lavi&s;hed on me? That I &s;hould be &s;um|moned to hear it, too, in the pre&s;ence of grave men; who are &s;o intent upon being &s;olemn that they dre&s;s them&s;elves in gar|ments &s;uch as no man ever &s;aw, unle&s;s at plays and puppet-&s;hews, le&s;t they &s;hould forget to act &s;olemnity well?</P>
<P>This indictment &s;ays that the&s;e fal&s;e traitors, I being one, met and a&s;&s;embled in Saint Giles's. I have had numberle&s;s occa|&s;ions to pa&s;s through the precincts of Saint Giles, though never to meet traitors there; I have &s;een the blue balls with which they abound, &s;ure tokens of vice and wretched|ne&s;s; have remarked the gin-&s;hops with angui&s;h, and have heard their bla&s;phemies with di&s;gu&s;t. But Saint Giles him&s;elf, with all his ruffians, makes no &s;uch ruffian attacks, nor in &s;uch &s;et and ruffian like phra&s;e, as this grave, ridiculous, and fal&s;e, this unintelligibly accurate and definitely incomprehen&s;ible in&s;trument of juri&s;pru|dence, an indictment.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I do but recapitulate facts.
<PB N="69" REF="206">It is not my fault that &s;uch is law. I &s;peak in the pre&s;ence of lawyers: men acknow|ledged to be the fir&s;t in their profe&s;&s;ion. To &s;ome of them I am indebted for an at|tempt on my life; and, what is infinitely more precious, my hone&s;t fame, my moral exi&s;tence, and future utility; to others for the defence of the&s;e ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings. What I have this day had occa&s;ion to &s;ay, concerning law, I am well aware mu&s;t have excited their mutual amazement; and perhaps their mutual indignation. I wi&s;h not to offend; but I own that I, in my turn, am amazed to recollect that the facts innumerable, of all nations and of all ages, and in few &s;o abundant as in this nation and in this age, I &s;ay, I am utterly a&s;toni&s;hed that the&s;e facts can be &s;o completely for|gotten, by the per&s;ons under who&s;e eye and who&s;e agency they are &s;o ince&s;&s;antly tran&s;acted! What, have they neither hear|ing &s;ight nor &s;en&s;e? Are they &s;o eager in the pur&s;uit of new errors that they have not a moment to glance at the pa&s;t?</P>
<P>Far be it from me to depreciate the indi|vidual,
<PB N="70" REF="207">I &s;peak only of the profe&s;&s;ion. As men, they frequently po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t dignified virtues of man; as in this conte&s;t has been mo&s;t eminently proved: as law|yers, they are what law has made them; as has in this conte&s;t been no le&s;s clearly demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;ecure in the con&s;cious rec|titude of good intention, let me lay bare my heart to you. Perhaps you think I have &s;poken with too little reverence of antient forms and in&s;titutions; which, how|ever they may &s;hun the te&s;t of rea&s;on, may yet demand re&s;pect. I know this is the opinion of many: I cannot help it that it is not mine. If I am in an error, I &s;incerely wi&s;h to be better informed; but I confe&s;s that, at pre&s;ent, I feel no more reverence for the trappings of antiquity than I do for a fool's cap and bells. I think them equally ridiculous and derogatory. Yet, while I would gladly prevail on every wearer of them to &s;trip him&s;elf of &s;uch in|&s;ignia of vice and folly, I would not move a finger in the way of force to wre&s;t them
<PB N="71" REF="208">from the characters whom I think they di&s;grace. No; till we can per&s;uade their fond owners to tear them away with their own hands, there let them remain. It is a mo&s;t &s;acred duty to proclaim the folly; but it is a duty &s;till more &s;acred, if po&s;&s;ible, not to per&s;ecute the fool. Let tho&s;e who think that by-words, wea&s;el &s;kins, the entrails of worms, and the white and yel|low dirt of Peru can dignify the human character continue &s;o to think, till in&s;truc|tion can cure them of their error: for my own part, I cannot re&s;pect ab&s;urdity; but I &s;hould be a vicious and a dangerous man could I attempt to offer it violence. I know that all this is no part of the creed of my accu&s;ers. I know that, in their code, it is high trea&s;on. If you, Gentlemen, think it &s;o, if you can di&s;cover any intention in me to excite in&s;urrection, civil war, and to depo&s;e the King and put him to death, let me &s;uffer all the horrors which the law has decreed again&s;t traitors: for, till I am convinced, I will not recant one &s;yllable.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury: thus far I have
<PB N="72" REF="209">been pleading as if there had been in my ca&s;e, as there is always &s;uppo&s;ed to be, &s;ome ground of charge, &s;ome colour of &s;u&s;picion, &s;ome &s;pecific accu&s;ation and forth-coming accu&s;ers, to induce the authors of this pro|&s;ecution to bring me into the horrid predi|cament in which I &s;tand: that of being pro|claimed a traitor to my country, an enemy to mankind, and of holding my life at the hazard of the mi&s;takes which the acrimony and prejudice of the moment might beget, or the intricacies of law and the &s;ubtleties of lawyers might produce. The wicked|ne&s;s of the attempt they have made upon my life is &s;o incredible that, &s;ince this mo&s;t &s;trange Grand Jury &s;trangely returned the Indictment pre&s;ented again&s;t me a true bill, I have daily and involuntarily a&s;ked my&s;elf, 'Is it po&s;&s;ible? Am I dreaming? Is the 'whole world mad? Or am I alone a mad|man?' Gentlemen! I had a li&s;t of two hundred and eight witne&s;&s;es given me with my indictment, few very few of whom, in the whole cour&s;e of my life, I had ever &s;een or heard of; and the remainder were, every
<PB N="73" REF="210">one of them, per&s;ons on whom I have called, and who&s;e te&s;timony you have heard directly and flatly di&s;proving, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, the crimes thus wickedly laid to my charge! Nearly two hundred unknown witne&s;&s;es, to come forward and prove upon me that I had con&s;pired to ex|cite in&s;urrection, rebellion, and war, to de|po&s;e the King, and to put him to death! This enormous infamy I am taxed with; and this cloud of witne&s;&s;es are a&s;&s;igned, un|der my pro&s;ecutors' own hand, to come upon oath and &s;ub&s;tantiate my guilt, at the moment I knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible, for any man on the face of the earth, to prove &s;uch crimes on me! This li&s;t is formally deliver|ed to me, by the Solicitor for the Trea&s;ury, in the pre&s;ence of his two Clerks, who are to depo&s;e to its &s;afe delivery! But what will you &s;ay, &s;itting here as you do the Judges of your country, when you &s;hall recollect that, in&s;tead of having, as my pro&s;ecutors a&s;&s;erted, two hundred and eight witne&s;&s;es to prove me guilty of rebellion, war, and put|ting the King to death, they had no one wit|ne&s;s
<PB N="74" REF="211">to prove my guilt; but that they had &s;everal who, in the very beginning of the Privy Council's inquiries, had uniformly depo&s;ed to the peacefulne&s;s of my princi|ples and actions. Yes, Gentlemen, the mem|bers of the Society for Con&s;titutional Infor|mation, whom they, that is, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas, the Lord Chancellor, Mr. Reeves, and the whole Privy Council interrogated concerning me, gave te&s;timony to my being a declared enemy to all force. One of the witne&s;&s;es, &s;ubpoenaed on this trial again&s;t me, told the Grand Jury that, &s;o far from being in a con&s;piracy to excite in&s;urrection, I was a natural Quaker: which he ex|plained by words importing that I had the peaceful morality of the Quakers, without their &s;piritual in&s;pirations.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the &s;tretch of con&s;cience of a State&s;man is to me unfathomable, How Mr. Pitt, how Mr. Dundas, how the Lord High Chancellor of the&s;e realms can recon|cile the&s;e things to their hearts, what their feelings are, what their waking thoughts, and what their &s;leeping, I cannot divine.
<PB N="75" REF="212">Could men of &s;uch gigantic and incompre|hen&s;ible State morality li&s;ten to the advice of one whom they have denounced a trai|tor, I would conjure them in&s;tantly to re|vi&s;e their pa&s;t conduct; to con&s;ider whether the con&s;tructive trea&s;ons which they have endeavoured to prove upon twelve men may not, with in&s;initely le&s;s violence, be turned to their own de&s;truction; whether their conduct or mine has been mo&s;t calcu|lated to excite in&s;urrection, rebellion, and war, with the other dreadful con&s;equences, the horror of which forbids their recapitu|lation; whether it be reconcileable to their morality thus to labour the death of an in|dividual who, were they at this moment in danger, would exert his whole faculties, &s;uch as they are, to prevent, not only the &s;hedding of their blood, but, all po&s;&s;ible harm from happening to them; and who, had he the power to do them good, would, from principle, conceive him&s;elf as irrevo|cably bound to do good to them as to any and to every other human being. Yes, Gentlemen, when I publi&s;h the errors they
<PB N="76" REF="213">have committed, it is not to injure the&s;e men; but to prevent them from injuring all mankind. And for this great end, to fur|ther this everla&s;ting cau&s;e, the cau&s;e of truth and the good of the whole, I will again brave per&s;onal danger, and all the mi&s;eries which mi&s;taken and injurious men can heap on my head.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you have heard my accu&s;ers, you have heard my witne&s;&s;es, you have heard my defence. Again&s;t my pro&s;ecutors, per&s;onally, who have in&s;tigated the accu&s;a|tion that has brought me into this perilous &s;tate, I deliberately declare I feel no re&s;ent|ment: though certainly I can conceive few horrors equal to tho&s;e which they have &s;ought to bring upon me. My property they have wa&s;ted; the means by which I &s;upported my family they have for a time cut off; my character they have attempted to bla&s;t. But, as all the&s;e injuries, and every other that man can commit, are ab&s;o|lutely no more than errors of the under|&s;tanding, to be angry at them is as irrational as it is unwi&s;e. I hope the fearful proceed|ings
<PB N="77" REF="214">of this whole pro&s;ecution will be a le&s;&s;on, too deeply impre&s;&s;ive to be ever for|gotten by them; and that they and all men will be more and more aver&s;e to the &s;hed|ding of blood. Should I live, and &s;hould the&s;e pro&s;ecutors &s;till remain unconvinced of their mi&s;takes, I will never cea&s;e to rai&s;e my weak voice, to warn them and the world again&s;t what I believe to be mi&s;takes &s;o pernicious. But, in doing this, &s;trict truth and the good of mankind &s;hall be my guides; and, if any bitterne&s;s of recollec|tion &s;hould ever induce me to alter or di&s;|gui&s;e the truth, I can hone&s;tly &s;ay it will be from &s;ome undetected mi&s;taken feeling; and not from any principle of revenge, which I con&s;ider as a heinous and highly mi&s;chievous crime.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my witne&s;&s;es, I could ea&s;ily have doubled the number. My fir&s;t care was to &s;elect &s;uch who&s;e character would not di&s;grace this High Tribunal of Ju&s;tice; and my next to cite per&s;ons of different ages, and oppo&s;ite parties, that you, Gentlemen of the Jury, might be convinced
<PB N="78" REF="215">my principles and conduct on all occa&s;ions were the &s;ame. You have now only to decide. The &s;entence for this crime is, <Q>That the culprit &s;hall be taken from the Bar, and conveyed to the place from whence he came; and from thence be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of exe|cution, there to be hanged by the neck; but not until he is dead; he &s;hall be taken down alive, his privy members &s;hall be cut off, and his bowels &s;hall be taken out and burnt before his face; his head &s;hall be &s;evered from his body, and his body &s;hall then be divided into four quarters, which are to be at the King's di&s;po&s;al; and the Lord have mercy on his &s;oul!</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, though I hold it impo&s;&s;ible for any human being to merit &s;o offen&s;ive a puni&s;hment, yet, as I am afraid I am &s;in|gular in this opinion, I do not mean to ap|peal to your humanity, but to your ju&s;tice; and, if I am a traitor, if I have compa&s;&s;ed or imagined the death of the King, if you have any &s;ort of proof that can ju&s;tify &s;uch a verdict to your own con&s;ciences, then pro|nounce
<PB N="79" REF="216">me Guilty; and let my members be cut off, my bowels burnt, my head &s;evered from the trunk, and my body divided into four quarters and &s;ent to be at the King's di&s;po&s;al: for it matters little to me whether it be at the King's and the hangman's, or the vultures' and the wolves'.</P>
