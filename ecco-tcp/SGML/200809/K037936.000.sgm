<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>TOM WHITE,</HI> THE POSTILION.</HEAD>
<P>TOM WHITE was one of the be&s;t dri|vers of a Po&s;t-chai&s;e on the Bath Road.&mdash;Tom was the &s;on of an hone&s;t labourer at a little village in Wilt&s;hire: he was an active indu&s;trious boy, and as &s;oon as he was big enough he left his father, who was burthened with a numerous family, and went to live with Farmer Hodges, a &s;ober worthy man in the &s;ame village. He drove the waggon all the week; and on Sundays, though he was now grown up, the farmer required him to attend the Sunday &s;chool, carried on under the in&s;pection of Dr. Shepherd, the worthy Vicar, and always made him read his Bible in the evening after he had &s;erved his bea&s;ts, and would have turned him out of his &s;ervice if he had ever gone to the ale-hou&s;e for his own plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
Tom by carrying &s;ome waggon loads of faggots, to the Bear inn at Devizes, &s;oon made many acquaintances in the &s;table-yard. He compared his own Carter's frock, and &s;hoes thick &s;et with nails, with the &s;mart red jacket and tight boots of the po&s;t-boys, and grew a&s;hamed of his own homely dre&s;s; he was re&s;olved to drive a chai&s;e, to get money, and to &s;ee the world. Fooli&s;h fellow! he never con&s;idered, that, though it is true, a waggoner works hard all day, yet he gets a quiet evening, and undi&s;turbed re&s;t at night. However as there-mu&s;t be chai&s;e-boys as well as plough-boys, there was no great harm in the change. The evil company to which it expo&s;ed him, was the chief mi&s;|chief. He left farmer Hodges though not without &s;orrow at quitting &s;o kind a ma&s;ter, and got him&s;elf hired at the Black Bear.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the temptations to which he was now expo&s;ed, Tom's good education &s;tood by him for &s;ome time. At fir&s;t he was frightened to hear the oaths and wickedwords which are too often uttered in a &s;table-yard. However, though he thought it wrong, he had not the courage to reprove it, and the next &s;tep to being ea&s;y at &s;eeing others &s;in, is to &s;in our&s;elves. By degrees he began to think it manly, and a mark of &s;pirit in others to &s;wear; though the force of good habits was &s;o &s;trong, that at fir&s;t when he &s;wore him&s;elf it was with
<PB N="5" REF="5">fear and in a low voice. But he was &s;oon laughed out of his &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s, as they cal|led it; and though he never became &s;o pro|phane and bla&s;phemous as &s;ome of his com|panions, (for he never &s;wore in cool blood or in mirth as &s;o many do,) yet he would too often u&s;e a dreadful bad word when he was in a pa&s;&s;ion with his hor&s;es. And here I cannot but drop a hint on the great folly as well as wickedne&s;s of being in a great rage with poor bea&s;ts, who, not having the gift of rea&s;on, cannot be moved like human crea|tures, with all the wicked words that are &s;aid to them; but who, unhappily, having the gift of &s;eeling, &s;uffer as much as human creatures can do, at the cruel and unnece&s;&s;ary beatings given them. He had been bred up to think that drunkenne&s;s was a great &s;in, for he never &s;aw farmer. Hodges drunk in his life, and where a farmer is &s;o &s;ober, his men are le&s;s likely to, drink, or if they do, the ma&s;ter can reprove them with the better grace.</P>
<P>Tom was not naturally fond of drink, yet for the &s;ake of being thought merry company, and a hearty fellow, he often drank more than he ought. As he had been u&s;ed to go to church twice on a Sunday while he lived with the farmer, who &s;eldom u&s;ed his hor&s;es on that day except to carry his wife to church be|hind him, Tom felt a little unea&s;y when he was &s;ent the very fir&s;t Sunday a long journey
<PB N="6" REF="6">with a great family; for I cannot conceal the truth, that too many gentlefolks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill travel when there is no nece&s;&s;ity for it on a Sunday, and when Monday would an&s;wer the end ju&s;t as well. This is a great grief to all good and &s;ober people, both rich and poor. How|ever he kept his thoughts to him&s;elf, though he could not now and then help thinking how quietly things were going on at the farmer's, who&s;e waggoner on a Sunday led as ea&s;y a life as if he had been a gentleman. But he &s;oon lo&s;t all thoughts of this kind, and did not know a Sunday from a Monday. Tom went on pro&s;perou&s;ly, as it is called, for three or four years, got plenty of money, but &s;aved not a &s;hilling. As &s;oon as his hor&s;es were once in the &s;table, whoever would might &s;ee them fed for Tom.&mdash;He had other fi&s;h to fry.&mdash;Fives, cards, cudgel playing, laying wagers, and keeping loo&s;e company, each of which he at fir&s;t di&s;liked, and then practi&s;ed, ran away with all his money, and all his &s;pare time; and though he was generally in the way as &s;oon as the hor&s;es were ready, (becau&s;e if there was no driving there was no pay,) yet he did not care whether the carriage was clean or the hor&s;es looked well, if the harne&s;s was whole, or the hor&s;es well &s;hod. The certainty that the gains of to-morrow would make up for the extravagance of to-day, made him quite thoughtle&s;s and happy, for he was young,
<PB N="7" REF="7">active, and healthy, and never fore&s;aw that a rainy day might come, when he would want what he now &s;quandered.</P>
<P>One day being a little flu&s;tered with liquor as he was driving his return chai&s;e through Brentford, he &s;aw ju&s;t before him another empty carriage, driven by one of his ac|quaintance: he whipped up his hor&s;es, re|&s;olving to out&s;trip the other, and &s;wearing dreadfully that he would be at the Red Lion fir&s;t&mdash;for a pint&mdash;done, cried the other&mdash; a wager&mdash;Both out and &s;purred the poor bea&s;ts with the u&s;ual fury, as if their credit had been really at &s;take, or their lives had de|pended on this fooli&s;h conte&s;t. Tom's chai&s;e had now got up to that of his rival, and they drove along-&s;ide of each other with great fury and many imprecations. But in a narrow part, Tom's chai&s;e being in the middle, with his antagoni&s;t on one &s;ide, and a cart driving again&s;t him on the other, the hor&s;es reared, the carriages got entangled, Tom roared out a great oath to the other to &s;top, which he either could not, or would not do, but re|turned a horrid imprecation that he would win the wager if he was alive. Tom's hor&s;es took fright and he was thrown to the ground with great violence. As &s;oon as he could be got from under the wheels, he was taken up &s;en&s;ele&s;s; his leg was broke in two places,
<PB N="8" REF="8">and his body much brui&s;ed. Some people whom the noi&s;e had brought together, put him into the Po&s;t-chai&s;e, in which the wag|goner kindly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, but the other driver &s;eemed carele&s;s and indifferent, and drove off, ob&s;erving with a brutal coolne&s;s, "I am &s;orry I have lo&s;t my pint; I &s;hould have beat him hollow, had it not been for this <HI>little accident.?</HI> Some gentlemen who came out of the inn, after reprimanding this &s;avage, inquired who he was wrote to inform his ma&s;ter, and got him di&s;charged: re&s;olving that neither they nor any of their friends would ever employ him, and he was long out of place.</P>
<P>Tom was taken to one of tho&s;e excellent ho&s;pitals with which London abounds. His agonies were dreadful, his leg was &s;et, and a high fever came on. As &s;oon as he was left alone to reflect on his condition, his fir&s;t thought was that he &s;hould die, and his horror was in conceivable&mdash;"Alas", &s;aid he, "what will become of my poor &s;oul? I am cut off in the very commi&s;&s;ion of three great &s;ins:&mdash;I was drunk, I was in a horrible pa&s;&s;ion, and I had oaths and bla&s;phemies in my mouth."&mdash;He tried to pray, but he could not, his mind was all di&s;traction, and he thought he was &s;o very wicked that God would not forgive him; "becau&s;e," &s;ays he.</P>
<P>I have &s;inned again&s;t light and knowledge,
<PB N="9" REF="9">and a &s;ober education, and good examples, and I de&s;erve nothing but puni&s;hment."&mdash;At length he grew light-headed, and there was little hopes of his life. Whenever he came to his &s;en&s;es for a few minutes, he cried out, "O! that my old companions could now &s;ee me, &s;urely they would take warning by my &s;ad fate, and repent before it is too late."</P>
<P>By the ble&s;&s;ing of God on the &s;kill of the &s;urgeon, and the care of the nur&s;es, he how|ever grew better in a few days. And here let me &s;top to remark, what a mercy it is that we live in a Chri&s;tian country, where the poor, when &s;ick, or lame, or wounded, are taken as much care of as any gentry; nay in &s;ome re&s;pects more, becau&s;e in ho&s;pitals and infirmaries there are more doctors and &s;urgeons to attend, than mo&s;t private gentle|folks can afford to have at their own hou&s;es, whereas <HI>there never was an ho&s;pital in the whole heathen world.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be God for this, among the thou&s;and other excellent fruits of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</P>
<P>It was eight weeks before Tom could be taken out of bed. This was a happy affliction; for this long &s;ickne&s;s and &s;olitude gave him time to reflect on his pa&s;t life. He began &s;eriou&s;ly to hate tho&s;e darling &s;ins which had brought him to the brink of ruin. He could now pray heartily; he confe&s;&s;ed and lament|ed
<PB N="10" REF="10">his iniquities with many tears, and began to hope that the mercies of God, through the merits of a Redeemer, might yet be ex|tended to him on his &s;incere repentance. He re&s;olved never more to return to the &s;ame evil cour&s;es, but he did not tru&s;t in his own &s;trength, but prayed that God would give him grace for the future, as well as pardon for the pa&s;t. He remembered, and he was humbled at the thought, that he u&s;ed to have &s;hort fits of repentance, and to form re&s;olu|tions of amendment, in his wild and thought|le&s;s days, and often when he had a bad head|ache after a drinking bout, or had lo&s;t his money at all-fours, he vowed never to drink or play again. But as &s;oon as his head was well, and his pockets recruited, he forgot all his re&s;olutions. And how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e? for he tru&s;ted in his own &s;trength, he never prayed to God to &s;trengthen him, nor ever avoided the next temptation.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e was now different. Tom began to find that <HI>his &s;trength was perfect weakne&s;s,</HI> and that he could do nothing without the Di|vine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for which he prayed heartily and con&s;tantly. He &s;ent home for his Bible, and Prayer-book, which he had not opened for two years, and which had been given him when he left the Sunday School. He &s;pent the chief part of his time in reading them and thus derived great comfort, as well as
<PB N="11" REF="11">great knowledge. The &s;tudy of the Bible filled his heart with gratitude to God who had not cut him off in the mid&s;t of his &s;ins, but given him &s;pace for repentance; and the ago|nies he had lately &s;uffered with his broken leg increa&s;ed his thankfulne&s;s, that he had e&s;caped the more dreadful pain of eternal mi&s;ery. And here let me remark what en|couragement this is for rich people to give away Bibles and good books, and not to lo&s;e all hope, though for a time they &s;ee little or no good effect from it. According to all ap|pearance, Tom's were never likely to do him any good, and yet his generous benefactor who had ca&s;t his bread upon the waters, found it after many days, for this Bible which had lain untouched for years, was at la&s;t made the means of his reformation. God will work in his own good time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he got well, and was di&s;charged from the ho&s;pital, Tom began to think he mu&s;t return to get his bread. At fir&s;t he had &s;ome &s;cruples about going back to his old employ: but, &s;ays he, &s;en&s;ibly enough, gentlefolks mu&s;t travel, travellers mu&s;t have chai&s;es, and chai&s;es mu&s;t have drivers 'tis a very hone&s;t calling, and I don't know that goodne&s;s belongs to one &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s more than another; and he who can be good in a &s;tate of great temptation, provided the cal|ling be lawful, and the temptations are not
<PB N="12" REF="12">of his own &s;eeking, and he be diligent in pray|er may be better than another man for aught I know: and <HI>all that belongs to us is to do our duty in that &s;tate of life in which it &s;hall plea&s;e God to call us.</HI> Tom had rubbed up his catechi&s;m at the ho&s;pital, and 'tis a pity that people don't look at their catechi&s;m &s;ometimes when they are grown up; for it is full as good for men and women as it is for children; nay better, for though the an&s;wers contained in it are intended for children to <HI>repeat,</HI> yet the duties enjoined in it are in|tended for men and women to put in <HI>practice.</HI></P>
<P>Tom now felt grieved that he was obliged to drive on Sundays. But People who are in earne&s;t, and have their hearts in a thing, can find helps in all ca&s;es. As &s;oon as he had &s;et down his company at their &s;tage, and had &s;een his hor&s;es fed, &s;ays Tom, "A man who takes care of his hor&s;es will generally think it right to let them re&s;t an hour or two at lea&s;t. In every town it is a chance but there may be a church open during part of that time. If the prayers &s;hould be over, I'll try hard for the Sermon, and if I dare not &s;tay to the Sermon, it is a chance but I may catch the prayers; it is worth trying for, however; and as I u&s;ed to make no|thing of making a pu&s;h, for the &s;ake of get|ting an hour to gamble, I need not grudge to take a little pains extraordinary to &s;erve
<PB N="13" REF="13">God. By this watchfulne&s;s he &s;oon got to know the hours of &s;ervice at all the towns on the road he travelled, and while the hor&s;es fed, Tom went to church; and it became a favourite proverb with him, that <HI>prayers and provender hinder no man's journey.</HI></P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>At fir&s;t his companions wanted to laugh and make &s;port of this&mdash;but when they &s;aw that no lad on the road was up &s;o early or worked &s;o hard as Tom: When they &s;aw no chai&s;e &s;o neat, no gla&s;&s;es &s;o bright, nor har|ne&s;s &s;o tight, no driver &s;o diligent, &s;o clean, or &s;o civil, they found he was no &s;ubject to make &s;port at. Tom indeed was very care|ful
<PB N="14" REF="14">in looking after the linch pins, in never giving his hor&s;es too much water when they were hot; nor, whatever was his ha&s;te, would he ever gallop them uphill, &s;trike them acro&s;s the head, or when tired, cut and &s;la&s;h them in driving on the &s;tones, as &s;oon as he got into a town, as &s;ome fooli&s;h fellows do. What helped to cure Tom of the&s;e bad prac|tices, was that remark he met with in the Bible, that <HI>a good man is merciful to his bea&s;t.</HI> He was much moved on reading the Prophet Jonah, to ob&s;erve what compa&s;&s;ion the great God of heaven and earth had for poor bea&s;ts: for one of the rea&s;ons there given, why the Almighty was unwilling to de&s;troy the great city of Ninevah was, <HI>be|cau&s;e there was much cattle in it.</HI> After this, Tom never could bear to &s;ee a wanton &s;troke inflicted.</P>
<P>Tom &s;oon grew rich for one in his &s;tation; for every gentleman on the road would be driven by no other lad if <HI>careful Tom</HI> was to be had. Being diligent, he <HI>got</HI> a great deal of money; being frugal, he <HI>&s;pent</HI> but little; and having no vices, he <HI>wa&s;ted</HI> none. He &s;oon found out that there was &s;ome meaning in that text which &s;ays, that. <HI>Godline&s;s hath the promi&s;e of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come:</HI> for the &s;ame prin|ciples which make a man &s;ober and hone&s;t, have al&s;o a natural tendency to make him
<PB N="15" REF="15">healthy and rich; while a drunkard and a &s;pend thrift can hardly e&s;cape being &s;ick, and a beggar in the end. Vice is the parent of mi&s;ery here as well as hereafter.</P>
<P>After a few years Tom begged a holiday, and made a vi&s;it to his native village; his good character had got thither before him. He found his father was dead, but during his long illne&s;s Tom had &s;upplied him with money, and by allowing him a trifle every week, had had the hone&s;t &s;atisfaction of keeping him from the pari&s;h. Farmer Hodges was &s;till living, but being grown old and in|firm, he was de&s;irous to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s. He retained a great regard for his old &s;ervant, Tom; and finding he was worth money, and knowing he knew &s;omething of country bu|&s;ine&s;s, he offered to let him a &s;mall, farm at an ea&s;y rate, and promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the management for the fir&s;t year, with the loan of a &s;mall &s;um of money, that the might &s;et out with a pretty &s;tock. Tom thanked him with tears in his eyes, went back and took a hand&s;ome leave of his ma&s;ter, who made him a pre&s;ent of a hor&s;e and cart, in acknow|led gement of his long and faithful &s;ervices; for, &s;ays he, "I have &s;aved many hor&s;es by Tom's care and attention, and I could well afford to do the &s;ame by every &s;ervant who did the &s;ame by me; and &s;hould be a richer man at the end of every year by the &s;ame ge|nero&s;ity,
<PB N="16" REF="16">genero&s;ity, provided I could meet with ju&s;t and faithful &s;ervants who de&s;erved the &s;ame rewards."</P>
<P>Tom was &s;oon &s;ettled in his new farm, and in le&s;s than a year had got every thing neat and decent about him. Farmer Hodges's long experience and friendly advice, joined to his own indu&s;try and hard labour, &s;oon brought the farm to great perfection. The regularity, &s;obriety, peaceablene&s;s and piety of his daily life, his con&s;tant attendance at Church twice every Sunday, and his decent and devout behaviour when there, &s;oon re|commended him to the notice of Dr. Shep|herd, who was &s;till living, a pattern of zeal, activity, and benevolence to all pari&s;h Prie&s;ts. The Dr. &s;oon began to hold up Tom, or as we mu&s;t now more properly term him, Mr. Thomas White, to the imitation of the whole pari&s;h, and the frequent and conde&s;cending conver&s;ation of this worthy Clergyman, con|tributed no le&s;s than his preaching to the im|provement of his new pari&s;hioner.</P>
<P>Farmer White &s;oon found out that a dairy could not well be carried on without a mi&s;|tre&s;s and began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of marry|ing; he prayed to God to direct him in, &s;o important a bu&s;ine&s;s. He knew that a tawdry, vain, dre&s;&s;y girl, was not likely to make good chee&s;e and butter, and that a worldly
<PB N="17" REF="17">and ungodly woman would make a &s;ad wife and mi&s;tre&s;s of a family. He &s;oon heard of a young woman of excellent character, who had been bred up by the vicar's lady, and &s;till lived in the family as upper maid. She was prudent, &s;ober, indu&s;trious and religious. Her neat, mode&s;t, and plain appearance at church, (for &s;he was &s;eldom, &s;een any where el&s;e out of her ma&s;ter's family) was an ex|ample to all per&s;ons in her &s;tation, and never failed to recommend her to &s;trangers, even before they had an opportunity of knowing the goodne&s;s of her character. It was her character, however, which recommended her to farmer White. He knew that <HI>favour is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a wo|man that feareth the Lord, &s;he &s;hall be prai&s;ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>&mdash;"aye, and not only prai&s;ed, but cho&s;en too," &s;ays Farmer White, as he took down bis hat from the nail on which it hung, in order to go and wait on Dr. Shepherd, to break his mind and a&s;k his con&s;ent; for he thought it would be a very unhand &s;ome return for all the favours he was receiving from his Mini&s;ter, to decoy away his faithful &s;ervant from her place without his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This worthy gentleman, though &s;orry to lo&s;e &s;o valuable a member of his little family, did not &s;cruple a moment about parting with her, when he found it would be &s;o greatly to her advantage. Tom was agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="18">to hear &s;he had &s;aved fifty pounds by her frugality. The Doctor married them him&s;elf&punc; Farmer Hodges being pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Dr. Shepherd conde&s;cend|ed to call on Farmer and Mrs. White, to give a few words of advice on the new duties they had entered into; a common cu&s;tom with him on tho&s;e occa&s;ions. He often took an opportunity to drop, in the mo&s;t kind and tender way, a hint on the great indecency of making marriages, chri&s;tenings, and above all funerals, days of riot and exce&s;s, as is too often the ca&s;e in country villages. The ex|pectation that the vicar might po&s;&s;ibly drop in, in his walks, on the&s;e fe&s;tivities, &s;ome|times re&s;trained, exce&s;&s;ive drinking, and im|proper conver&s;ation, even among tho&s;e far|mers who were not re&s;trained by higher mo|tives, as farmer and Mrs. White were.</P>
<P>What the Dr. &s;aid was always in &s;uch a cheerful, good-humoured way, that it was &s;ure to increa&s;e the plea&s;ure of the day, in|&s;tead of damping it. "Well, farmer," &s;aid he, "and you my faithful Sarah, any other friend might recommend peace and agreement to you on your marriage, but I on the contrary recommend cares and &s;trifes."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dodd's Sayings</NOTE> The company &s;tared&mdash;but Sarah, who knew that her old ma&s;ter was a facetious gentleman, and
<PB N="19" REF="19">always had &s;ome good meaning behind, look|ed &s;erious. "Cares and &s;trifes, Sir," &s;aid the farmer, "what do you mean?" "I mean," &s;aid he, "for the fir&s;t, that your cares &s;hall be who &s;hall plea&s;e GOD mo&s;t, and your &s;trifes, who &s;hall &s;erve him be&s;t, and do your duty mo&s;t faithfully. Thus, all your cares and &s;trifes being employed to the highe&s;t purpo&s;es, all petty cares and worldly &s;trifes &s;hall be at an end.</P>
<P>"Always remember, both of you, that you have &s;till a better friend than each other."&mdash;The company &s;tared again, and thought to woman could have &s;o good a friend as her hu&s;band. "As you have cho|&s;en each other from the be&s;t motives," con|tinued the Doctor, "you have every rea&s;on|able ground to hope for happine&s;s; but as this world is a &s;oil, in which troubles and misfortunes will &s;pring up; troubles from which you cannot &s;ave one another: then remember, is the be&s;t wi&s;dom to go to that friend who is always near, always willing, and always able, to help you, and that friend is GOD."</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid Farmer White, "I humbly thank you for all your kind in&s;tructions, of which I &s;hall now &s;tand more in need than ever, as I &s;hall have more duties to fulfil. I hope the remembrance of my pa&s;t offences
<PB N="20" REF="20">will keep me humble, and the &s;en&s;e of my remaining &s;in will keep me watchful. I &s;et out in the world, Sir, with what is called a good natural di&s;po&s;ition, but I &s;oon found to my co&s;t that without God's grace, that will carry a man but a little way. A good temper is a good thing, but nothing but the fear of GOD can enable one to bear up again&s;t temptation, evil company, and evil pa&s;&s;ions. The misfortune of breaking my leg, as I then thought it, has proved the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of my life. It &s;hewed me my own weakne&s;s, Sir, the value of the Bible, and the goodne&s;s, of GOD. How many of my brother drivers, have I &s;een &s;ince that time, cut off in the prime of life by drinking, or by &s;ome &s;udden accident, while I have not only been &s;pared, but ble&s;&s;ed and pro&s;pered. O Sir! it would be the joy of my heart, if &s;ome of my old comrades, good-natured, civil fellows, (whom I can't help loving) could &s;ee, as I have done, the danger of evil cour&s;es before it is too late. Though they may not hearken to you, Sir, or any other&punc; <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> they may believe <HI>me,</HI> becau&s;e I have been one of them: and I can &s;peak from experience, of the great difference there is, even as to worldly comfort, between a life of &s;obriety and a life of &s;in. I could tell them, Sir, not as a thing I have read in a book, but as a truth I feel in my own heart, that to fear GOD and keep his commandments, will not only "bring
<PB N="21" REF="21">a man peace at the la&s;t," but will make him happy <HI>now.</HI> And I will venture to &s;ay, Sir, that all the &s;tocks, pillories, pri&s;ons, and gib|bets in the land, though &s;o very needful to keep bad men in order, yet will never re&s;train a good man from committing evil, half &s;o much as that &s;ingle text, "how &s;hall I do this great wickedne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God?" Dr. Shepherd conde&s;cended to approve of what the farmer had &s;aid, kindly &s;hook him by the hand, and took leave.</P>
<P>Thomas White had always been fond of &s;inging, but he had for many years de&s;pi&s;ed that vile tra&s;h which is too often &s;ung in a &s;table-yard. One Sunday evening he heard his mi&s;tre&s;s at the Bear read &s;ome ver&s;es out of a fine book called the Spectator. He was &s;o &s;truck with the picture it contains of the great mercies of GOD, of which he had him&s;elf partaken &s;o largely, that he took the liberty to a&s;k her for the&s;e ver&s;es, and &s;he being a very good-natured woman, made her daughter write out for the po&s;tilion the fol|lowing.</P>
