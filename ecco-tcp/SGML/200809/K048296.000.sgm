<L>'TIS &s;trange that authors, who &s;o rarely find</L>

<L>Still &s;end, with piteous tone and look forlorn,</L>
<L>The Prologue forth to deprecate your &s;corn;</L>
<L>Such doleful heralds, which would fain appear</L>
<L>The timid &s;truggles of a mode&s;t fear,</L>
<L>The &s;urly Critic views with jealous &s;pleen,</L>
<L>As the dull pre&s;age of the coming &s;cene.</L>
<L>In vain, the dread ho&s;tility to calm,</L>
<L>E'en potent Flatt'ry tries her &s;oothing balm;</L>
<L>Pity's a crime his lo&s;ty &s;oul di&s;dains</L>
<L>And his pride fea&s;ts upon the poet's pains,</L>
<L>Yet now no critic rancour need we fear,</L>
<L>For lib'ral candour holds her empire here,</L>
<L>Candour, who &s;corns for little faults to pry,</L>
<L>But looks on merits with a partial eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;ure a bard who&s;e mu&s;e &s;o oft has found</L>
<L>The happy pow'r to kindle mirth around,</L>
<L>Though, in her &s;portive moods, aver&s;e to trace,</L>
<L>The rigid forms of <HI>Action, Time,</HI> and <HI>Place,</HI></L>
<L>While gen'rous objects animate her view,</L>
<L>May &s;till her gay luxuriant cour&s;e pur&s;ue;</L>
<L>For, mid her whims, &s;he &s;till has &s;hewn the art,</L>
<L>To pre&s;s the USEFUL MORAL on the heart;</L>
<L>With ju&s;t contempt the worthle&s;s to di&s;card,</L>
<L>And deal to VIRTUE its de&s;erv'd reward.</L>

<L>The bard who&s;e favour'd mu&s;e could joy afford,</L>
<L>That eas'd the cares of Rome's Imperial Lord,</L>

They pre&s;erve to her mind, per&s;on, and means, purity, health, and independence of obligation, which thro' the devious paths of her future life, to the un&s;u&s;pecting female, is often the con|cealed adder, for the de&s;truction of her in|nocence.</P>
