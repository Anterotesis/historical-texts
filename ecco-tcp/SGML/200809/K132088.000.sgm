<HEAD>THE RIOT; OR, HALF A LOAF IS BETTER THAN NO BREAD. IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN JACK ANVIL AND TOM HOD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Tune of <HI>"A Cobler there was," &amp;c.</HI></OPENER>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>COME, neighbours, no longer be patient and quiet</L>
<L>Come let us go kick up a bit of a riot;</L>
<L>I am hungry, my lads, but I've little to eat,</L>
<L>So we'll pull down the mills, and &s;eize all the meat:</L>
<L>I'll give you good &s;port, boys, as ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aw,</L>
<L>So a fig for the Ju&s;tice, a fig for the law.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<LG>
<L>Then his pitchfork Tom &s;eiz'd&mdash;hold a moment &s;ays Jack,</L>
<L>I'll &s;hew thee thy blunder, brave boy, in a crack.</L>
<L>And if I don't prove we had better be &s;till,</L>
<L>I'll a&s;&s;i&s;t thee &s;traitway to pull down every mill;</L>
<L>I'll &s;hew thee how pa&s;&s;ion thy rea&s;on does cheat,</L>
<L>Or I'll join thee in plunder for bread and for meat.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What a whim&s;ey to think thus our bellies to fill,</L>
<L>For we &s;top all the grinding by breaking the mill?</L>
<L>What a whim&s;ey to think we &s;hall get more to eat</L>
<L>By abu&s;ing the butchers who get us the meat!</L>
<L>What a whim&s;ey to think we &s;hall mend our &s;pare diet</L>
<L>By breeding di&s;turbance, by murder and riot!</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Becau&s;e I am dry, 'twould be fooli&s;h, I think</L>
<L>To pull out my tap and to &s;pill all my drink;</L>
<L>Becau&s;e I am hungry and want to be fed.</L>
<L>That is &s;ure no wi&s;e rea&s;on for wa&s;ting my bread;</L>
<L>And ju&s;t &s;uch wi&s;e rea&s;ons for mending their diet</L>
<L>Are us'd by tho&s;e blockheads who ru&s;h into riot.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I would not take comfort from others di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>But &s;till I would mark how God our land ble&s;&s;es;</L>
<L>For tho' in Old England the times are but &s;ad,</L>
<L>Abroad I am told they are ten times as bad;</L>
<L>In the land of the Pope there is &s;carce any grain,</L>
<L>And 'tis &s;till wor&s;e, they &s;ay, both in Holland and Spain.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let us look to the harve&s;t our wants to beguile,</L>
<L>See the lands with rich crops how they every where &s;mile!</L>
<L>Mean time to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, by each We&s;tern breeze,</L>
<L>Some corn is brought daily acro&s;s the &s;alt &s;eas,</L>
<L>We'll drink little tea, no whi&s;ky at all,</L>
<L>But patiently wait, and the prices will fall.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, if we're not quiet, then let us not wonder</L>
<L>If things grow much wor&s;e by our riot and plunder;</L>
<L>And let us remember, whenever we meet,</L>
<L>The more ale we drink, boys, the le&s;s we &s;hall eat.</L>
<L>On tho&s;e days &s;pent in riot, <HI>no</HI> bread you brought home,</L>
<L>Had you &s;pent them in labour you mu&s;t have had <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A dinner of herbs, &s;ays the wi&s;e man, with quiet</L>
<L>Is better than beef amid di&s;cord and riot.</L>
<L>If the thing can't be help'd, I'm a foe to all &s;trife,</L>
<L>And pray for a peace every night of my life;</L>
<L>But in matters of &s;tate not an inch will I budge,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e I conceive I'm no very good judge.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But tho' poor, I can work, my brave boys, with the be&s;t,</L>
<L>Let the King and the Parliament manage the re&s;t;</L>
<L>I lament both the War and the Taxes together,</L>
<L>Tho' I verily think they don't alter the weather.</L>
<L>The King, as I take it with very good rea&s;on,</L>
<L>May prevent a bad law, but can't help a bad &s;ea&s;on.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Parliament-men, altho' great is their power,</L>
<L>Yet they cannot contrive us a bit of a &s;hower;</L>
<L>And I never yet heard, tho' our Rulers are wi&s;e;</L>
<L>That they know very well how to manage the &s;kies;</L>
<L>For the be&s;t of them all, as they found to their co&s;t,</L>
<L>Were not able to hinder la&s;t Winter's hard fro&s;t.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be&s;ides, I mu&s;t &s;hare in the wants of the times,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e I have had my full &s;hare in it's crimes;</L>
<L>And I'm apt to believe the di&s;tre&s;s which is &s;ent,</L>
<L>Is to puni&s;h and cure us of all di&s;content.</L>
<L>&mdash;But harve&s;t is coming&mdash;Potatoes will come!</L>
<L>Our pro&s;pect clears up; Ye complainers be dumb!</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tho' I've no money, and tho' I've no lands,</L>
<L>I've a head on my &s;houlders, and a pair of good hands;</L>
<L>So I'll work the whole day, and on Sundays I'll &s;eek</L>
<L>At church how to bear all the wants of the week.</L>
<L>The Gentlefolks too will afford us &s;upplies;</L>
<L>They'll &s;ub&s;cribe&mdash;and they'll give up their puddings and pies.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then before I'm induced to take part in a Riot,</L>
<L>I'll a&s;k this &s;hort que&s;tion&mdash;What &s;hall I get by it?</L>
<L>So I'll e'en wait a little till cheaper the bread,</L>
<L>For a mittimus hangs o'er each Rieters head;</L>
<L>And when of two evils I'm a&s;k'd which is be&s;t,</L>
<L>I'd rather be hungry than be hang'd, I prote&s;t.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth Tom, thou art right: If I ri&s;e, I'm a Turk,</L>
<L>So he threw down his pitchfork, and went to his work.</L>
