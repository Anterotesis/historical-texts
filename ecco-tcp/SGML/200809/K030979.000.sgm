<L>BEFORE this court our Authore&s;s you'll allow,</L>

<L>And doing what good &s;quires wou'd do of cour&s;e,</L>
<L>Compare we thus our Lady to a hor&s;e.</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e &s;ome pony then, of make and blood,</L>
<L>In jockey phra&s;e, a little bit but good;</L>
<L>Who, beating all competitors in pace,</L>
<L>Had won the whip of many a country race;</L>
<L>Urg'd by its ma&s;ter, or the love of gain,</L>
<L>Should this our poney &s;eek Newmarket's plain.</L>
<L>How &s;oon might all its little honours fade,</L>
<L>Sunk on "The Flats," or &s;ticking in "Choak-jade."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fancy Newmarket then the &s;cene you &s;ee,</L>
<L>You are "the knowing ones" the pony &s;he&mdash;</L>
<L>Has &s;he not then well-founded cau&s;e to dread&mdash;</L>
<L>Speak, would ye bet the odds upon her head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, &s;imile apart, the fact is this,</L>
<L>The day has been &s;he has not done ami&s;s;</L>
<L>But prai&s;e has made her tim'rous more than vain,</L>
<L>And late &s;ucce&s;s augments the pre&s;ent pain.</L>
<L>A woman&mdash;there's indulgence in the name&mdash;</L>
<L>A widow too&mdash;that gives a &s;tronger claim.</L>
<L>If &s;he &s;hould fall, &s;he falls as women do,</L>
<L>"Like &s;tars," &s;ucce&s;sful &s;he may ri&s;e anew.</L>

<L>The Ladies, &s;ure, will not their aid withdraw,</L>

<L>May gladly claim acquaintance with her pen.</L>
<L>Some Bard, perhaps, who thrives by oppo&s;ition,</L>
<L>Might form a kind of &s;cribbling coalition.</L>
<L>Her aid, in odes, probationary cite,</L>
<L>&mdash;Tho&s;e odes, which Poets-laureat never write;</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;oft court &s;mall-talk flows in numbers bland&punc;</L>
<L>And greatly &s;ports at que&s;tion and command&mdash;</L>
<L>Here law, with open hand and ready mouth,</L>
<L>There Scotch, that never reach'd beyond the South.</L>
<L>Great Indian names, that mock articulation,</L>
<L>And Iri&s;h wit, of Engli&s;h fabrication.</L>
<L>If Wit and Beauty then for us write,</L>
<L>Who will deny their powerful aid to-night.&mdash;</L>

of no &s;ignification at all!&mdash;Beauty in London is &s;o cheap, and con&s;equently &s;o common to the men of fa&s;hion, (who are prodigiou&s;ly fond of novelty) that they ab&s;olutely begin to fall in love with the ugly women, by way of change.&mdash;</P>

<P>Oh Fi&s;h, that woman's non|&s;en&s;e, at which you laugh'd, was graced with &s;entiments of the &s;tricte&s;t truth!&mdash;Young women are no longer thought of here.&mdash;How ra&s;hly did I give credit to our fooli&s;h country people!&mdash;They told me, that, "Tho' only admired by them, in London I &s;hou'd be adored&mdash;that beau|ty here was rare&mdash;that virtue"&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very odd!&mdash;For my part I thought him &s;o much in love!&mdash;And &s;ometimes I thought you looked a little.&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I felt a warmth&mdash;a &s;ome|thing like tenderne&s;s for him, I own; but that it was the effect of love I will not pretend to &s;ay&mdash;It was perhaps the effect of hope&mdash;Pride too, had a great &s;hare in the agitation of my heart&mdash;and gratitude might have confirm'd the whole &s;en&s;ation love.&mdash;But, in the moment gratitude &s;hou'd have been in&s;pired, re&s;entment, indignation, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;and I am now left &s;olely to &s;hame and di&s;appointment.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!&mdash;it's very odd that a man &s;hould give him&s;elf &s;o much trouble to come here after you, &s;o many times as he did, and then all of a &s;udden never to come near you for a whole month.&mdash;I &s;hould not mind lo&s;ing him, neither, if &s;ome duke or other great man would come in&s;tead of him; or even that &s;trange young man we met on the road, as we came to town, and that was &s;o kind to us when our chai&s;e broke down.</P>

making it on the road.&mdash;For notwith&s;tanding that young man looked &s;o countrified, and had hardly a word to &s;ay for him&s;elf, he's worth thou&s;ands!&mdash;And poor Humphry, his &s;ervant, per&s;uaded me to give him our direction; that his ma&s;ter and he might come after us to London&mdash;And yet, to &s;ee the ficklene&s;s of man! we have heard nor &s;een nothing of them.&mdash;But, dear ma|dam, his Lord&s;hip runs mo&s;t in my head&mdash;Per|haps he is &s;ick?</P>

<P><STAGE>(To Mi&s;s Angle.)</STAGE> Why the de|vil
<PB N="47" REF="52">
did you confe&s;s? Nobody would have &s;een it in your face!&mdash;Be&s;ides, you have robb'd me of the plea&s;ure of conducting her Lady&s;hip to a pri&s;on; and damn me, if I ever met with &s;o great a di&s;appointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conduct me, Sir&mdash;I am ready to attend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has de&s;troyed my peace&mdash;and I &s;hall &s;ee her go to pri&s;on without a &s;igh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I would not, without lo&s;ing my life.&mdash;Madam, I'll &s;atisfy you for whatever lo&s;s you may have &s;u&s;tained by this Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can't &s;atisfy me.&mdash;I've lo&s;t Mr. Walm&s;ley.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now a&s;k her, what &s;he demands for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall take nothing le&s;s than the gentleman him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;I like her for that&mdash;&s;he does not undervalue me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Clownly, while you ima|gine you are giving your protection to a thief only&mdash;you are protecting a more de&s;picable cha|racter.&mdash;Had poverty &s;educed me to the crime of which I am accu&s;ed, le&s;s wou'd have been my remor&s;e, le&s;s ought to have been the cen&s;ure in|curred&mdash;But vanity&mdash;folly&mdash;a mi&s;taken con|fidence in that gentleman's honour, and my own attractions, prompted me to avail my&s;elf of a contemptible &s;cheme, in order to regain his ac|quaintance,
<PB N="48" REF="53">
which (admitting what he profe&s;s'd to me real) he him&s;elf wou'd have rejoiced at.&mdash;But the event has proved and di&s;covered both our hearts&mdash;nor can I reproach him with the cru|elty of his, while I experience the mo&s;t poig|nant reproofs of an inward monitor for the guilty folly of my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o this was only a &s;cheme for the Lady to procure a hu&s;band.&mdash;Here, Lady Mary, is your beloved &s;hawl.&mdash;Take it, and take care&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, do you take care of that, and I'll take care of my&s;elf.&mdash;Yet, I don't know, perhaps I may have her; but if I may judge by appearance&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>On that witne&s;s, who in com|pany has not, throughout the adventures of this day, appeared culpable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.&mdash;Even I my&s;elf at one time made no very innocent figure.&mdash;The&s;e adventures &s;hall then be a warning to us, never to judge with &s;everity, while the parties have only appearances again&s;t them.</P>
