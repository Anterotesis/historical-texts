<P><HI>Yet one excelling Greek,</HI> &amp;c.] Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, the celebrated hi&s;torian and critic of the Augu&s;tan age, who &s;ettled in Italy, as he him&s;elf informs us, on the clo&s;e of the civil war. He has addre&s;&s;ed a little treati&s;e, containing a critique on the elder hi&s;torians, to his friend Cnaeus Pompeius, whom the French cri|tics
<PB N="86" REF="84">
&s;uppo&s;e to be Pompey the Great; but Rei&s;ke, the la&s;t editor of Diony&s;ius, has &s;unk him into a petty Greek grammarian, the client or freedman of that illu&s;trious Roman.</P>
<P>In this treati&s;e of Diony&s;ius, and in one &s;till longer, on the character of Thucydides, there are &s;ome excellent hi&s;torical pre|cepts, which Mr. Spelman has judiciou&s;ly thrown together in the preface to his admirable tran&s;lation of the Roman Antiquities.&mdash; He introduces them by the following ob&s;ervation, which may &s;erve perhaps to recommend the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent poem.&mdash; "So much has been &s;aid, both by the antients and the moderns, in prai&s;e of the advantages re&s;ulting from the &s;tudy of Hi&s;tory, parti|cularly by Diodorus Siculus among the former, in the noble pre|face to his Hi&s;torical Collections; and by the late Lord Bolingbroke, among the moderns, in his admirable letter on that &s;ubject; that I am a&s;toni&s;hed no treati&s;e has ever yet appeared in any age, or any language, profe&s;&s;edly written to pre&s;cribe rules for writing Hi&s;tory; a work allowed to be of the greate&s;t advantage of all others to mankind, the repo&s;itory of truth, fraught with le&s;&s;ons both of pub|lic and private virtue, and enforced by &s;tronger motives than pre|cepts&mdash;by examples. Rules for Poetry and Rhetoric have been writ|ten by many authors, both antient and modern, as if delight and eloquence were of greater con&s;equence than in&s;truction: however, Rhetoric was a part of Hi&s;tory, as treated by the antients; not the principal part indeed, but &s;ub&s;ervient to the principal; and calcu|lated to apply the facts exhibited by the narration. I know it may be &s;aid, that many antient hi&s;tories are &s;till pre&s;erved, and that the&s;e models are &s;ufficient guides for modern Hi&s;torians, with|out particular rules: &s;o had the Greeks Poets of all denominations in their hands, and yet Ari&s;totle thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;cribe particular rules to his countrymen for applying tho&s;e examples to every branch of Poetry: I wi&s;h he had done the &s;ame in Hi&s;tory; if he had, it is very probable that his precepts would have rendered
<PB N="87" REF="85">
the be&s;t of our modern Hi&s;tories more perfect, and the wor&s;t, le&s;s abominable.&mdash;Since the re&s;urrection of letters, the want of &s;uch a guide has been complained of by many authors, and particularly by Rapin, in the preface to his Hi&s;tory of England."&mdash;Spelman, page 15. But this ingenious and learned writer &s;peaks a little too &s;trongly, in &s;aying no treati&s;e has ever appeared in any age or lan|guage, containing rules for Hi&s;tory. There is one in Latin by the celebrated Vo&s;&s;ius, entitled Ars Hi&s;torica; another by Hubertus Folieta, an elegant Latin writer, of the 16th century, on whom Thuanus be&s;tows the highe&s;t commendation; and Ma&s;cardi, an Italian critic, patroni&s;ed by Cardinal Mazarine, has written al&s;o dell Arte Hi&s;torica. The curious reader may find a &s;ingular anec|dote relating to the publication of this work in Bayle, under the article Ma&s;cardi. But to return to Diony&s;ius, in comparing He|rodotus and Thucydides. He cen&s;ures the latter with a degree of &s;everity unwarranted by truth and rea&s;on: indeed this &s;everity ap|peared &s;o &s;triking to the learned Fabricius, that he &s;eems to con&s;i|der it as a kind of proof, that the critical works of Diony&s;ius were compo&s;ed in the ha&s;ty fervor of youth. They are however in gene|ral, to u&s;e the words of the &s;ame ingenuous author, eximia &amp; lectu digna; and a valuable critic of our own country, who re&s;embles Diony&s;ius in elegance of compo&s;ition, and perhaps in &s;everity of judgment, has &s;poken yet more warmly in their favour.&mdash;See Warton's E&s;&s;ay on Pope, 3d edit. page 175.</P>

<P><HI>In Egypt once a dread tribunal &s;tood.</HI>] This &s;ingular in&s;titution, which is alluded to by many of our late authors, is related at large in the Fir&s;t Book of Diodorus Siculus; and as the pa&s;&s;age is cu|rious, the following free tran&s;lation of it may afford entertainment to the Engli&s;h reader&mdash;"Tho&s;e who prepare to bury a relation, give notice of the day intended for the ceremony to the judges, and to all the friends of the decea&s;ed; informing them, that the body will pa&s;s over the lake of that di&s;trict to which the dead be|longed:
<PB N="89" REF="87">
when, on the judges being a&s;&s;embled, to the number of more than forty, and ranging them&s;elves in a &s;emicircle on the farther &s;ide of the lake, the ve&s;&s;el is &s;et afloat, which tho&s;e who &s;uperintend the funeral have prepared for this purpo&s;e. This ve&s;&s;el is managed by a pilot, called in the Egyptian language Charon; and hence they &s;ay, that Orpheus, travelling in old times into Egypt, and &s;eeing this ceremony, formed his fable of the infernal regions, partly from what he &s;aw, and partly from invention. The ve&s;&s;el being launched on the lake, before the coffin which contains the body is put on board, the law permits all, who are &s;o inclined, to produce an accu&s;ation again&s;t it.&mdash;If any one &s;teps forth, and proves that the decea&s;ed has led an evil life, the judges pronounce &s;entence, and the body is precluded from burial; but if the accu&s;er is con|victed of inju&s;tice in his charge, he falls him&s;elf under a con&s;i|derable penalty. When no accu&s;er appears, or when the accu&s;er is proved to be an unfair one, the relations, who are a&s;&s;embled, change their expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow into encomiums on the dead: yet they do not, like the Greeks, &s;peak in honour of his family, becau&s;e they con&s;ider all Egyptians as equally well-born; but they &s;et forth the education and manners of his youth, his piety and ju&s;tice in maturer life, his moderation and every virtue by which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed; and they &s;upplicate the infernal Deities to receive him as an a&s;&s;ociate among the ble&s;t. The multitude join their acclamations of applau&s;e in this celebration of the dead, whom they con&s;ider as going to pa&s;s an eternity among the ju&s;t below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Siculi Lib. i. <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c.</NOTE>."&mdash; Such is the de&s;cription which Diodorus gives of this funereal judicature, to which even the kings of Egypt were &s;ubject. The &s;ame author a&s;&s;erts, that many &s;overeigns had been thus judicially deprived of the honours of burial by the indignation of their peo|ple: and that the terrors of &s;uch a fate had a mo&s;t &s;alutary influence on the virtue of their kings.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="88">The Abbe Terta&s;&s;on has drawn a &s;ublime picture of this &s;epul|chral proce&s;s, and indeed of many Egyptian My&s;teries, in his very learned and ingenious romance, The Life of Sethos.</P>

is effected &s;ometimes by a mixture of magnificence and beauty: at other times &s;olely by immen&s;ity and grandeur. The latter &s;eems to have been the object in the erecting of tho&s;e celebrated buildings in Egypt: and they certainly have an&s;wered the de&s;ign. For not only the va&s;tne&s;s of their &s;tructure; and the area which they occupy, but the ages they have endured, and the very uncertainty of their hi&s;tory, which runs &s;o far back into the depths of antiquity, produce altogether a wonderful veneration; to which buildings more exqui&s;ite and embelli&s;hed are &s;eldom entitled. Many have &s;uppo&s;ed, that they were de&s;igned for places of &s;epulture: and it has been affirmed by Herodotus, and other ancient writers. But they &s;poke by gue&s;s: and I have &s;hewn by many in&s;tances, how u&s;ual it was for the Grecians to mi&s;take temples for tombs. If the chief Pyramid, were de&s;igned for a place of burial, what occa&s;ion was there for a well, and for pa&s;&s;ages of communication which led to other buildings? Near the Pyramids are apartments of a wonder|ful fabric, which extend in length one thou&s;and four hundred feet, and about thirty in depth. They have been cut out of the hard rock, and brought to a perpendicular by the arti&s;t's chizel; and through dint of labour fa&s;hioned as they now appear. They were undoubt|edly de&s;igned for the reception of prie&s;ts; and con&s;equently were not appendages to a tomb; but to a temple of the Deity . . . . . . The prie&s;ts of Egypt delighted in ob&s;curity; and they probably came by the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages of the building to the dark chambers within; where they performed their lu&s;trations, and other nocturnal rites. Many of the ancient temples in this country were caverns in the rocks, enlarged by art, and cut out into numberle&s;s dreary apartments: for no nation upon earth was &s;o addicted to gloom and melancholy as the Egyptians.</P>

<P><HI>The dome expands!&mdash;Behold th' Hi&s;toric Sire!</HI>] Herodotus, to whom Cicero has given the honourable appellation of The Father of Hi&s;tory, was born in Halicarna&s;&s;us, a city of Caria, four years before the inva&s;ion of Xerxes, in the year 484 before Chri&s;t. The time and place of his death are uncertain; but his countryman Diony&s;ius informs us, that he lived to the beginning of the Pelo|ponne&s;ian war; and Marcellinus, the Greek author who wrote a life of Thucydides, affirms there was a monument erected to the&s;e two great Hi&s;torians in a burial-place belonging to the family of Miltiades.</P>
<P>There is hardly any author, antient of modern, who has been more warmly commended, or more vehemently cen&s;ured, than this eminent Hi&s;torian. But even the &s;evere Diony&s;ius declares, he is one of tho&s;e enchanting writers, whom you peru&s;e to the la&s;t &s;yl|lable with plea&s;ure, and &s;till wi&s;h for more.&mdash;Plutarch him&s;elf, who has made the mo&s;t violent attack on his veracity, allows him all

the merit of beautiful compo&s;ition. From the heavy charges brought again&s;t him by the antients, the famous Henry Stephens, and his learned friend Camerarius, have defended their favourite Hi&s;|torian with great &s;pirit. But Herodotus has found a more formi|dable antagoni&s;t in a learned and animated writer of our own times, to whom the public have been lately indebted for his having opened to them new mines of Oriental learning.&mdash;If the ingenious Mr. Richard&s;on could effectually &s;upport his Per&s;ian &s;y&s;tem, the great Father of the Grecian &s;tory mu&s;t &s;ink into a fabuli&s;t as low in point of veracity as Geoffrey of Monmouth.

By this lady he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have left children; and the emperor Tacitus is conjectured to have been a remote de&s;cendant from the Hi&s;torian, to who&s;e works and memory he paid the highe&s;t regard.&mdash;It is re|ported by Sidonius Apollinaris, that Tacitus recommended the province of writing Hi&s;tory to Pliny the Younger, and that he did not him&s;elf engage in that employment, till his friend had declined it. This is not mentioned, indeed, in any of the beautiful letters &s;till remaining from Pliny to Tacitus; but it is an in&s;tance of delicacy not unparallel'd among the Antients, as will appear from the following remark by one of the mo&s;t elegant and liberal of mo|dern critics.&mdash;"The Roman Poet, who was not more eminent by his genius than amiable in his moral character, affords perhaps the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance that any where occurs, of the con|ce&s;&s;ions which a mind &s;trongly impregnated with &s;entiments of genuine amity, is capable of making.

I have been chiefly led to engage in this Hi&s;tory of my father by the following circum&s;tance:&mdash;It was my fortune to marry Cae&s;ar Nicephorus, of the Bryennian family, a man far &s;uperior to all his cotemporaries, not only in per&s;onal beauty, but in &s;ublimity of under&s;tanding, and all the charms of eloquence! for he was equally the admiration of tho&s;e who &s;aw, and tho&s;e who heard him. But that my di&s;cour&s;e may not wander from its pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e, let me proceed in my narration!&mdash;He was then, among all men, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed; and when he marched with the emperor John Comnenus, my brother, on his expedition again&s;t Antioch, and other places in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Barbarians, &s;till un|able to ab&s;tain from literary pur&s;uits, even in tho&s;e &s;cenes of labour and fatigue, he wrote various compo&s;itions worthy of remembrance and of honour. But he chiefly applied him&s;elf to the writing an account of what related to my father Alexius, emperor of the Romans, at the reque&s;t of the empre&s;s; reducing into proper form the tran&s;actions of his reign, whenever the times would allow him to devote &s;hort intervals of lei&s;ure from arms and battle to works of literature, and the labour of compo&s;ition. In forming this Hi&s;tory, he deduced his accounts from an early period, being di|rected in this point al&s;o by the in&s;truction of our royal mi&s;tre&s;s; beginning from the emperor Diogenes, and de&s;cending to the per|&s;on, whom he had cho&s;en for the Hero of his Drama&mdash;for this &s;ea&s;on fir&s;t &s;hewed my father to be a youth of expectation. Be|fore this period he was a mere infant; and of cour&s;e performed nothing worthy of being recorded: unle&s;s even the occurrences of his childhood &s;hould be thought a fit &s;ubject for Hi&s;tory. Such then was the de&s;ign and &s;cope of Cae&s;ar's compo&s;ition: but he fail'd in the hope he had entertained, of bringing his Hi&s;tory to its conclu&s;ion: for having brought it to the times of the emperor Nicephorus Botoniates, he there broke off, having no future op|portunity allowed him of continuing his narration: a circum|&s;tance,
<PB N="107" REF="105">
which has proved a &s;evere lo&s;s to Literature, and robbed his readers of delight!&mdash;On this account I have undertaken to record the actions of my father, that &s;uch atchievements may not e&s;cape po&s;terity. What degree of harmony and grace the writings of Cae&s;ar po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, all per&s;ons know, who have been fortunate enough to &s;ee his compo&s;itions. But having executed his work to the pe|riod I have mentioned, in the mid&s;t of hurry and fatigue, and bring|ing it to us half fini&s;hed from his expedition, he brought home, alas! at he &s;ame time, a di&s;order that proved mortal, contracted perhaps from the hard&s;hips of his pa&s;&s;age, or perhaps from that harra&s;&s;ing &s;cene of perpetual action, and po&s;&s;ibly indeed from his infinite anxiety on my account; for anxiety was natural to his af|fectionate heart, and his labours were without intermi&s;&s;ion. More|over the change and badne&s;s of climates might prepare for him this draught of death. For notwith&s;tanding the dreadful &s;tate of his health, he per&s;evered in the campaign again&s;t the Syrians and Cili|cians, till at length he was conveyed out of Syria in a mo&s;t infirm &s;tate, and was brought through Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lydia, and Bithynia, home to the metropolis of the empire, and to his fa|mily. But his vitals were now affected by his infinite fatigue.&mdash; Even in this &s;tate of weakne&s;s he was de&s;irous of di&s;playing the events of his expedition: but this his di&s;order rendered him unable to execute, and indeed we enjoined him not to attempt it, le&s;t by the effort of &s;uch a narration he &s;hould bur&s;t open his wound.&mdash; But in the recollection of the&s;e things, my whole &s;oul is darkened, and my eyes are covered with a flood of tears.&mdash;O what a director of the Roman coun&s;els was then torn from us! O what an end was there to all the trea&s;ures of clear, of various, and of u&s;eful knowledge, which he had collected from ob&s;ervation and expe|rience, both in regard to foreign affairs, and the internal bu&s;ine&s;s of the empire! &mdash;O what a form was then de&s;troyed!&mdash;Beauty, that &s;eemed not only entitled to dominion, but bearing even the
<PB N="108" REF="106">
&s;emblance of divinity!&mdash;I indeed have been conver&s;ant with every calamity; and have found, even from the imperial cradle, an un|propitious fortune: &s;ome perhaps might e&s;teem that fortune not unpropitious, which &s;eemed to &s;mile upon my birth, in giving me &s;overeigns for my parents, and nur&s;ing me in the imperial purple: but for the other circum&s;tances of my life, alas, what tempe&s;ts! alas, what perturbations! The melody of Orpheus affected even ina|nimate nature; and Timotheus, in playing the Orthic &s;ong to Alexander, made the Macedon &s;tart to arms.</P>
<P>The relation of my mi&s;eries would not, indeed, produce &s;uch effects; but it would move every auditor to tears; it would force not only beings endued with &s;en&s;ibility, but even inanimate nature to &s;ympathize in my &s;orrow.&mdash;This remembrance of Cae&s;ar, and his unexpected death, tears open the deepe&s;t wound of my &s;oul: Indeed, I con&s;ider all my former misfortunes, if compared to this immea&s;ureable calamity, but as a drop of water to the Atlantic &s;ea: or rather, my earlier afflictions were a kind of prelude to this: they fir&s;t involved me, as it were, like a &s;moke preceding this raging fire: they were a kind of heat, that portended a conflagra|tion, which no words can de&s;cribe. O thou fire, that blaze&s;t without fuel, preying on my heart without de&s;troying its exi&s;tence; piercing through my very bones, and &s;hrinking up my &s;oul!&mdash; But I perceive my&s;elf hurried away from my &s;ubject: this mention of Cae&s;ar, and what I &s;uffer in his lo&s;s, has led me into the pro|lixity of grief: wiping therefore the tear from my eyes, and re|&s;training my&s;elf from this indulgence of &s;orrow, I will proceed in order; yet, as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Euripides.</NOTE> tragic Poet &s;ays,
<Q>Still adding tear to tear,</Q>
as recollecting misfortune after misfortune: for the entering on the Hi&s;tory of &s;uch a king, &s;o eminent for his virtues, revives

in my mind all the wonders he performed, which move me to fre&s;h tears: and the&s;e I &s;hare in common with all the world; for the remembrance of him, and the recital of his reign, &s;upplies to me a new &s;ubject of lamentation, and mu&s;t remind others of the lo&s;s they have &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>But let me at length begin the Hi&s;tory of my father, from the period mo&s;t proper:&mdash;now the mo&s;t proper period is that, which will give to my narration the cleare&s;t, and mo&s;t hi&s;torical appearance.&mdash;</P>

<P><HI>If mitred Turpin told, in wilde&s;t &s;train.</HI>] It is now generally agreed, that the Hi&s;tory which bears the name of Turpin, Arch|bi&s;hop of Rheims, was the forgery of a Monk, at the time of the Cru&s;ades, though Pope Calixtus the Second declare it to be au|thentic.&mdash;But, as it was certainly intended to pa&s;s as genuine Hi&s;|tory, whenever it was compo&s;ed, and actually did &s;o for &s;ome ages, this poetical mention of it appeared not improper. For the entertainment of the curious reader, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the two mi|raculous pa&s;&s;ages alluded to in the poem:&mdash;Ante diem belli, ca&s;tris et arietibus &amp; turmis praeparatis in pratis, &s;cilicet quae &s;unt inter ca&s;trum, quod dicitur Talaburgum, &amp; urbem, juxta fluvium Caranta, infixerunt Chri&s;tiani quidam ha&s;tas &s;uas erectas in terra ante ca&s;tra, cra&s;tina vero die ba&s;tas &s;uas corticibus &amp; frondibus de|coratas invenerunt; hi &s;cilicet qui in bello prae&s;enti accepturi erant martyrii palmam pro Chri&s;ti fide.&mdash;Qui etiam tanto miraculo Dei gavi&s;i, ab&s;ci&s;&s;is ha&s;tis &s;uis de terra, &s;imul coaduniti primitus in bello perierunt, &amp; multos Saracenos occiderunt, &s;ed tandem Martyrio coronantur.

To this extract from Mr. War|ton, it may be proper to add a conci&s;e account of that romantic embelli&s;hment, to which I have particularly alluded:&mdash;Uther Pen|dragon, at the fe&s;tival of his coronation, falls in love with Igerna, the wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall; and being prevented from, pur&s;uing his addre&s;&s;es by the vigilance of the hu&s;band, he applies to the magical power of Merlin for the completion of his de&s;ire.&mdash; This he obtains by being transformed into the per&s;on of Gorlois, and thus introducing him&s;elf to the deluded Igerna, as Jupiter vi|&s;ited Alcmena, he gives birth to the celebrated Arthur.&mdash;Man&s;it itaque rex ea nocte cum Igerna &amp; &s;e&s;e de&s;iderata venere refecit.

<P>After this event, he retired to his own country, and obtained the benefice of Le&s;tines, in the dioce&s;e of Cambray.&mdash;But the cure of &s;ouls was an office little &s;uited to the gay and gallant Froi&s;&s;art.&mdash; His genius led him &s;till to travel from ca&s;tle to ca&s;tle, and from court to court, to u&s;e the words of Mr. Warton, who has made occa&s;ional mention of our author, in his elegant Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art now entered into the &s;ervice of the Duke of Bra|bant; and, as that Prince was him&s;elf a poet, Froi&s;&s;art collected all the compo&s;itions of his ma&s;ter, and adding &s;ome of his own, formed a kind of romance, which he calls
<Q><L>Un Livre de Meliador</L>
<L>Le Chevalier au &s;oleil d'or,</L></Q>
and of which, in one of his later poems, he gives the following ac|count:
<Q><L>Dedans ce Romant &s;ont enclo&s;es</L>

<P>The Duke died in 1384, before this work was completed; and Froi&s;&s;art &s;oon found a new patron in Guy earl of Blois, on the marriage of who&s;e Son he wrote a Pa&s;toral, entitled Le Temple d'Honneur.&mdash;The earl having reque&s;ted him to re&s;ume his Hi&s;tory,
<PB N="119" REF="119">
he travelled for that purpo&s;e to the celebrated court of Ga&s;ton earl of Foix, who&s;e high reputation for every knightly virtue attracted to his re&s;idence at Orlaix, tho&s;e martial adventurers, from who&s;e mouth it was the delight of Froi&s;&s;art to collect the materials of his Hi&s;tory.&mdash;The courteous Ga&s;ton gave him the mo&s;t flattering recep|tion: he &s;aid to him with a &s;mile (&amp; en bon Fran&ccedil;ois) "qu'il le connoi&s;&s;oit bien, quoyqu'il ne l'eu&s;t jamais veu, mais qu'il avoit bien oui parler de luy, &amp; le retint de &s;on ho&s;tel."&mdash;It became a fa|vourite amu&s;ement of the Earl, to hear Froi&s;&s;art read his Romance of Meliador after &s;upper.&mdash;He attended in the ca&s;tle every night at 12, when the Earl &s;ate down to table, li&s;tened to him with ex|treme attention, and never di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, till he had made him vuider tout ce qui e&s;toit re&s;t&eacute; du vin de &s;a bouche.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art gained much information here, not only from his patron, who was him&s;elf very communicative, but from various Knights of Arragon and England, in the retinue of the Duke of Lanca&s;ter, who then re&s;ided at Bordeaux.&mdash;After a long re&s;idence in this brilliant court, and after receiving a pre&s;ent from the liberal Ga&s;ton, which he mentions in the following ver&s;es:

Froi&s;&s;art departed in the train of the Counte&s;s of Boulogne, related to the earl of Foix, and ju&s;t leaving him, to join her new hu&s;band the Duke of Berry.&mdash;In this expedition our Hi&s;torian was robbed near Avignon, and laments the unlucky adventure in a very long poem, from which Mr. de St. Palaye has drawn many particulars of his life. The ground-work of this poem (which is not in the li&s;t of our Author's poetical pieces, that Mr. Warton has given us from Pa&s;quier) &s;eems to have a &s;trong vein of humour.&mdash;It is a
<PB N="120" REF="120">
dialogue between the Poet and the &s;ingle Florin that he has left out of the many which he had either &s;pent, or been obliged to &s;ur|render to the robbers.&mdash;He repre&s;ents him&s;elf as a man of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive turn: in 25 years he had &s;quandered two thou&s;and franks, be&s;ides his eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues. The compo&s;ition of his works had co&s;t him 700; but he regretted not this &s;um, as he expected to be amply repaid for it by the prai&s;e of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>After having attended all the fe&s;tivals on the marriage of the Duke of Berry, having traver&s;ed many parts of France, and paid a vi&s;it to Zeland, he returned to his own country in 1390, to continue his Hi&s;tory from the various materials he had collected.&mdash;But not &s;atisfied with the relations he had heard of the war in Spain, he went to Middlebourgh in Zeland, in pur&s;uit of a Portugueze Knight, Jean Ferrand Portelet, vaillant homme &amp; &s;age, &amp; du Con&s;eil du Roy de Portugal. From this accompli&s;hed &s;oldier Froi&s;&s;art expected the mo&s;t perfect information, as an ocular witne&s;s of tho&s;e &s;cenes, which he now wi&s;hed to record.&mdash;The courteous Portelet received our indefatigable Hi&s;torian with all the kindne&s;s which his en|thu&s;ia&s;m de&s;erved, and in &s;ix days, which they pa&s;&s;ed together, gave him all the intelligence he de&s;ired.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art now returned home, and fini&s;hed the third book of his Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Many years had pa&s;t &s;ince he had bid adieu to England: taking advantage of the truce then e&s;tabli&s;hed between France and that country, he paid it ano|ther vi&s;it in 1395, with letters of recommendation to the King and his uncles.&mdash;From Dover he proceeded to Canterbury, to pay his devoirs at the &s;hrine of Thomas of Becket, and to the memory of the Black Prince.&mdash;Here he happened to find the &s;on of that hero, the young King Richard, whom devotion had al&s;o brought to make his offerings to the fa&s;hionable Saint, and return thanks to Heaven for his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Ireland.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art &s;peaks of this adventure, and his own feelings on the great change of &s;cene that had taken place &s;ince his la&s;t vi&s;it to England, in the following natural and lively terms:&mdash;Le Roy . . . vint . . a trez grant arroy, et bien accom|paigne

Tho' Froi&s;&s;art was thus embarra&s;&s;ed in not finding one of his old friends in the retinue of the King, he &s;oon gained a new Patron in Thomas Percy, Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;ehold, who offered to pre&s;ent him and his letters to Richard; but this offer happening on the eve of the King's departure, it proves too late for the ceremony&mdash; Le Roy e&s;toit retrait pour aller dormir.&mdash;And on the morrow, when the impatient Hi&s;torian attended early at the Archbi&s;hop's palace, where the king &s;lept, his friend Percy advi&s;ed him to wait a more convenient &s;ea&s;on for being introduced to Richard.&mdash;Froi&s;&s;art ac|quie&s;ced in this advice, and was con&s;oled for his di&s;appointment by falling into company with an Engli&s;h Knight, who had attended the King in Ireland, and was very willing to gratify the curio&s;ity of the Hi&s;torian by a relation of his adventure.&mdash;This was Wil|liam de Li&s;le, who entertained him, as they rode along together, with the marvels of St. Patrick's Cave, in which he a&s;&s;ured him he had pa&s;&s;ed a night, and &s;een wonderful vi&s;ions.&mdash;Though our ho|ne&s;t Chronicler is commonly accu&s;ed of a pa&s;&s;ion for the marvel|lous, with an exce&s;s of credulity, he &s;ays very &s;en&s;ibly on this oc|ca&s;ion, de cette matiere je ne luy parlay plus avant, et m'en ce&s;&s;ay, car voulentiers je luy eu&s;&s;e demande du voyage d'Irlande, et luy eu voulaye parler, et mettre en voye.&mdash;It appears plainly from this pa&s;&s;age, that our Hi&s;torian was more anxious to gain information concerning the &s;cenes of real action, than to li&s;ten to the extrava|gant fictions of a popular legend.&mdash;But here he was again di&s;ap|pointed.&mdash;New companions joined them on the road, and their hi&s;torical conference was thus interrupted.&mdash;The&s;e mortifications were &s;oon repaid by the kind reception he met with from the Duke of York, who &s;aid to him, when he received the recom|mendatory

<P>It may &s;erve as a kind of memento mori to poetical vanity to reflect, that Froi&s;&s;art is hardly known as a Poet, though his fer|tile pen produced 30,000 ver&s;es, which were once the delight of Princes, and the favourite &s;tudy of the gallant and the fair.&mdash;How far he de&s;erved the oblivion, into which his poetical compo&s;itions have fallen, the reader may conceive from the following judgment of his French Critic; with who&s;e ingenious reflection on the im|perfections attending the early &s;tate both of Poetry and Painting, I &s;hall terminate this Note.</P>
<P>On peut dire en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral au &s;ujet des Poe&s;ies de Froi&s;&s;art, que l'invention pour les &s;ujets lui manquoit antant que l'imagination pour les ornemens; du re&s;te le &s;tyle qu'il employe, moins abon|dant que diffus, offre &s;ouvent la r&eacute;p&eacute;tition ennuyeu&s;e des m&ecirc;mes tours, &amp; des m&ecirc;mes phra&s;es, pour rendre des id&eacute;es a&s;&s;ez commu|nes: cependant la &s;implicit&eacute; et la libert&eacute; de &s;a ver&s;ification ne &s;ont pas to&ucirc;jours d&eacute;pourv&ucirc;es de graces, on y rencontre de tems en tems quelques images &amp; plu&s;ieurs vers de &s;uite dont l'expre&s;&s;ion e&s;t a&s;&s;ez heureu&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Thy Favour, like the Sun's prolific ray,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brought the keen Scribe of Florence into Day.</HI>] Nicholas Machiavel, the celebrated Florentine, was fir&s;t patronized by Leo, who cau&s;ed one of his comedies to be acted with great magnificence at Rome, and engaged him to write a private Treati&s;e de Reformatione Rei|publicae Florentinae. His famous political E&s;&s;ay, entitled, "The Prince," was publi&s;hed in 1515, and dedicated to the Nephew of that Pontiff. The various judgments that have been pa&s;&s;ed on this &s;ingular performance are a &s;triking proof of the incertitude of hu|man opinion.&mdash;In England it has received applau&s;e from the great names of Bacon and Clarendon, who &s;uppo&s;e it intended to pro|mote the intere&s;t of liberty and virtue. In Italy, after many years of approbation, it was publicly condemned by Clement the VIIIth, at the in&s;tigation of a Je&s;uit, who had not read the book. In France it has even been &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;trumental to the horrid
<PB N="126" REF="126">
ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew, as the favourite &s;tudy of Catherine of Medicis and her Sons, and as teaching the bloody le&s;&s;ons of ex|tirpation, which they &s;o fatally put in practice. Yet one of his French Tran&s;lators has gone &s;o far as to &s;ay, that "Machiavel, who pa&s;&s;es among all the world for a teacher of Tyranny, dete&s;ted it more than any man of the age, in which he lived." It mu&s;t however be owned, that there is a great mixture of good and evil in his political precepts. For the latter many plau&s;ible apologies have been made; and it &s;hould be remembered to his honour, that his great aim was to promote the welfare of his country, in exciting the Hou&s;e of Medicis to deliver Italy from the inva&s;ion of fo|reigners.</P>
<P>He is &s;aid to have been made Hi&s;toriographer of Florence, as a reward for having &s;uffered the torture on &s;u&s;picion of con&s;piring again&s;t the government of that city, having &s;upported the &s;evere trial with unfailing re&s;olution. His Hi&s;tory of that republic he wrote at the reque&s;t of Clement the VIIth, as we are informed in his Dedication of it to that Pontiff. The &s;tyle of this work is much celebrated, and the fir&s;t Book may be regarded as a model of Hi&s;torical abridgment.&mdash;He died, according to Paul Jovius, in 153O.</P>

Notwith&s;tanding the high reputation of Guicciardin, his Hi&s;tory has been violently attacked, both as to matter and &s;tyle.&mdash;The hone&s;t Montaigne inveighs with great warmth again&s;t the malignant turn of its author; and his own coun|tryman Boccalini, in who&s;e whim&s;ical but lively work there are many excellent remarks on Hi&s;tory and Hi&s;torians, &s;uppo&s;es a La|cedaemonian thrown into agonies by a &s;ingle page of Guicciardin, whom he is condemned to read, for having him&s;elf been guilty of u&s;ing three words in&s;tead of two.

<P><HI>Sarpi, ble&s;t name! from every foible clear.</HI>] Father Paul, the mo&s;t amiable and exalted character that was ever formed in mona&s;tic retirement, was the &s;on of France&s;co Sarpi, a merchant of Venice, and born in that city, 1552. He took the religious habit in the mona&s;tery of the Servites, 1565. After receiving prie&s;t's orders in 1574, he pa&s;&s;ed four years in Mantua, being appointed to read Lectures on Divinity and Canon Law, by the Bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e; and in this early part of his life, he is conjectured to have con|ceived the fir&s;t idea of writing his celebrated Hi&s;tory, as he formed an intimate friend&s;hip, during his re&s;idence in Mantua, with Ca|millo d'Oliva, who had been Secretary to Cardinal Gonzaga at the Council of Trent, and excited the learned Venetian to the arduous ta&s;k, which he &s;o happily accompli&s;hed in a future pe|riod. He was recalled from Mantua, to read Lectures on Philo&s;o|phy in his own convent at Venice, which he did with great repu|tation, during the years 1575, 1576, and 1577.&mdash;He went to Rome as Procurator General in 1585. Pa&s;&s;ing from thence to Naples, he there formed an acquaintance with the famous Bapti&s;ta Porta, who has left this honourable te&s;timony of his univer&s;al knowledge: &mdash;Eo doctiorem, &s;ubtiliorem, quotquot adhuc videre contigerit, neminem cognovimus; natum ad Encyclopediam, &amp;c. Nor is this an exaggerated compliment, as there is hardly any &s;cience which e&s;caped his active mind. His di&s;coveries in Optics and Anatomy would be alone &s;ufficient to immortalize his name, had he not

gained immortality by a &s;till nobler exertion of his mental powers, in defending the liberties of his country again&s;t the tyranny of Rome. On the fir&s;t attack of Pope Paul V. on two laws of Ve|nice, very wi&s;ely framed to correct the abu&s;es of the clergy, Fa|ther Paul aro&s;e as the literary champion of the Republic, and de|fended its cau&s;e with great &s;pirit and temper, in various compo&s;i|tions; though he is &s;aid not to be Author of the Treati&s;e ge|nerally a&s;cribed to him on the occa&s;ion, and entitled, <HI>The Rights of Sovereigns,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;His chief performance on the &s;ubject was <HI>Con|&s;iderazioni &s;opra le Cen&s;ure di Paolo V.</HI> The Venetians &s;hewed a ju&s;t admiration of the &s;ublime virtue of a Monk, who defended &s;o nobly the civil rights of his country again&s;t the &s;eparate intere&s;t of the church. In 1606 the Council pa&s;&s;ed a decree in his favour; which I &s;hall tran&s;cribe in this note, becau&s;e it is not found in the common Lives of Father Paul, and becau&s;e there is hardly any object more plea&s;ing to the mind, than the contemplation of a free &s;tate rewarding one of its mo&s;t virtuous &s;ervants with liberality and e&s;teem.&mdash;Continuando il R.

In 1607, after Venice had adju&s;ted her di&s;putes with Rome, by the mediation of France, the fir&s;t attack was made on the life of Father Paul. He was be&s;et near his convent, in the evening, by five a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who &s;tabbed him in many places, and left him for dead. He recovered, under the care of the celebrated Acquapen|dente, appointed to attend him at the public charge; to whom, as he was &s;peaking on the depth of the principal wound, his patient &s;aid plea&s;antly, that the world imputed it &s;tylo Romanae Curiae.&mdash; The crime is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have proceeded from the Je&s;uits; but the &s;ecret authors of it were never clearly di&s;covered, though the five ruffians were traced by the Venetian Amba&s;&s;ador in Rome, where they are &s;aid to have been well received at fir&s;t, but failing afterwards in their expected reward, to have peri&s;hed in mi&s;ery and want. The Senate of Venice paid &s;uch attention to Father Paul, as expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of his merit, and the mo&s;t affectionate &s;olicitude for his &s;afety. They not only doubled his &s;tipend a &s;e|cond time, but entreated him to chu&s;e a public re&s;idence, for the greater &s;ecurity of his per&s;on. The munificence and care of the Republic was equalled by the mode&s;ty and fortitude of their &s;er|vant. He cho&s;e not to relinqui&s;h his cell; and, though warned of various machinations again&s;t his life, he continued to &s;erve his country with unabating zeal; di&s;covering, in his private letters to

his friends, the mo&s;t heroic calmne&s;s of mind, and &s;aying, in an&s;wer to their admonitions, that "no man lives well, who is too anxious for the pre&s;ervation of life."&mdash;Yet the apprehen&s;ions of his friends had too ju&s;t a foundation. In 1609 another con&s;piracy was formed, to murder him in his &s;leep, by &s;ome per&s;ons of his own convent&mdash;but their treachery was happily di&s;covered.&mdash;From this time he lived in more cautious retirement, &s;till devoting him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of the Republic on various occa&s;ions, and acquiring new reputation by many compo&s;itions. At the length the world was &s;ur|prized by his Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent, fir&s;t publi&s;hed at London, 1619; with the fictitious name of Pietro Soave Polano; and dedicated to James the I&s;t, by Antonio de Dominis, the cele|brated Archbi&s;hop of Spalatto, who &s;peaks of the concealed Author as his intimate friend, who had entru&s;ted him with a manu&s;cript, on which his mode&s;ty &s;et a trifling value, but which it &s;eemed pro|per to be&s;tow upon the world even without his con&s;ent.&mdash;The my&s;tery concerning the publication of this noble work has never been thoroughly cleared up, and various fal&s;ities concerning it have been reported by author of con&s;iderable reputation.&mdash;It has even been &s;aid that James the I&s;t had &s;ome &s;hare in the compo&s;ition of the book&mdash;if he had, it was probably in forming the name Pietro Soave Polano, which is an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneziano, and the only part of the book which bears any relation to the &s;tyle or ta&s;te of that Monarch.&mdash;Father Paul was &s;oon &s;uppo&s;ed to be the real Author of the work in que&s;tion. The Prince of Cond&eacute;, on a vi&s;it to his cloy&s;ter, expre&s;&s;ly a&s;ked him, if he was &s;o&mdash;to which he mode&s;tly replied, that at Rome it was well known who had written it.&mdash;He enjoyed not many years the reputation ari&s;ing from this ma&s;terly production&mdash;in 1623 a fever occa&s;ioned his death, which was even more exemplary and &s;ublime than his life it&s;elf. &mdash;He prepared him&s;elf for approaching di&s;&s;olution with the mo&s;t devout compo&s;ure, and, as the liberty of his country was the dar|ling object of his exalted mind, he prayed for its pre&s;ervation

with his la&s;t breath, in the two celebrated words E&s;to Per|petua.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ingular beauty in the character of Father Paul, which is not only uncommon in his profe&s;&s;ion, but is rarely found in human nature.&mdash;Though he pa&s;&s;ed a long life in controver&s;y of the mo&s;t exa&s;perating kind, and was continually attacked in every manner that malignity could &s;ugge&s;t, both his writings and his heart appeared perfectly free from a vindictive &s;pirit&mdash;devoting all the powers of his mind to the defence of the public cau&s;e, he &s;eemed entirely to forget the injuries that were perpetually offered to his own per&s;on and reputation.</P>
<P>His con&s;titution was extremely delicate, and his inten&s;e applica|tion expo&s;ed him to very frequent and violent di&s;orders: the&s;e he greatly remedied by his &s;ingular temperance, living chiefly on bread, fruits, and water.&mdash;This imperfect account of a character de&s;erving the noble&s;t elogium, is principally extracted from an oc|tavo volume, entitled, Memoire Anedote &s;pettanti a F. Paolo da France&s;co Gri&s;elini Veneziano, &amp;c. edit. 2d, 1760. The author of this elaborate work has pointed out &s;everal mi&s;takes in the French and Engli&s;h accounts of Father Paul; particularly in the anecdotes related of him by Burnet, in his Life of Bi&s;hop Bedell, and by Mr. Brent, the &s;on of his Engli&s;h Tran&s;lator.&mdash;Some of the&s;e had indeed been ob&s;erved before by Writers of our own.&mdash;See the General Dictionary under the article Father Paul.&mdash;For the length and for the deficiencies of this Note, I am tempted to apo|logize with a &s;entence borrowed from the great Hi&s;torian who is the &s;ubject of it:&mdash;Chi mi o&s;&s;erver&agrave; in alcuni tempi abondare, in altri andar ri&s;tretto, &s;i ricordi che non tutti i campi &s;ono di ugnal fertilit&agrave;, ne tutti li grani meritano d'e&s;&s;er con&s;ervati, e di quelli che il mietitore vorrebbe tenerne conto, qualche &s;pica aneo sfugge la pre&s;a della mano, o il filo della falce, co&s;i comportando la con|ditione d'ogni mietitura che re&s;ti anco parte per ri&s;pigolare.</P>

<P><HI>The clear O&s;orius, in his cla&s;&s;ic phra&s;e.</HI>] Jerom O&s;orius was born of a noble family at Li&s;bon, 1506. He was educated at the univer&s;ity of Salamanca, and afterwards &s;tudied at Paris and Bologna. On his return to Portugal, he gradually ro&s;e to the Bi&s;hopric of Sylves, to which he was appointed by Catherine of Au&s;tria, Regent of the kingdom in the minority of Seba&s;tian. At the reque&s;t of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, he wrote his Hi&s;tory of King Emanuel, and the expedition of Gama&mdash;which his great contemporary Camoens made at the &s;ame time the &s;ubject of his immortal Lu&s;iad; a poem which has at length appeared with due lu&s;tre in our language, be|ing tran&s;lated with great &s;pirit and elegance by Mr. Mickle. It is remarkable, that the Hi&s;tory of O&s;orius, and the Epic Poem of Camoens, were publi&s;hed in the &s;ame year, 1572: but the fate of the&s;e two great Authors was very different; the Poet was &s;uffered to peri&s;h in poverty, under the reign of that Henry, who patronized the Hi&s;torian: yet, allowing for the difference of their profe&s;&s;ions, I am inclined to think they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;imilarity of mind. There appear many traces of that high heroic &s;pirit, even in the Prie&s;t O&s;orius, which animated the Soldier Camoens: particularly in the plea&s;ure, with which he &s;eems to de&s;cribe the martial manners of his countrymen, under the reign of Emanuel.&mdash;Illius aetate (&s;ays the Hi&s;torian, in the clo&s;e of his manly work) inopia in exilium pul&s;a videbatur: mae&s;titiae locus non erat: querimoniae &s;ilebant: omnia choreis &amp; cantibus per&s;onabant: eju&s;modi ludis aula regia frequenter oblectabatur. Nobiles adole&s;centes cum virginibus re|giis in aul&acirc; &s;ine ulla libidinis &s;ignificatione &s;altabant, et quamvis hone&s;ti&s;&s;imis amoribus indulgerent, virginibus erat in&s;itum, nemi|nem ad familiaritatem admittere, ni&s;i illum qui aliquid fortiter &amp; animo&s;e bellicis in rebus effeci&s;&s;et. Pueris enim nobilibus, qui in aula regia ver&s;abantur, non erat licitum pallium virile &s;umere,
<PB N="135" REF="135">
antequam in Africam trajicerent &amp; aliquod inde decus egregium re|portarent. Et his quidem moribus erat illius temporis nobilitas in&s;tituta, ut multi ex illius domo viri omni laude cumulati prodi|rent.&mdash;This is a &s;triking picture of the manners of chivalry, to which Portugal owed much of its glory in that &s;plendid period. There is one particular in the character of O&s;orius, which, con&s;i|dering his age and country, de&s;erves the highe&s;t encomium; I mean his tolerating &s;pirit. In the fir&s;t book of his Hi&s;tory, he &s;peaks of Emanuel's cruel per&s;ecution of the Jews in the following generous and exalted language:&mdash;Fuit quidem hoc nec ex lege nec ex religione factum. Quid enim? Tu rebelles animos nullaque ad id &s;u&s;cepta religione con&s;trictos, adigas ad credendum ea, quae &s;umma conten|tione a&s;pernantur &amp; re&s;puunt? Idque tibi a&s;&s;umas, ut libertatem voluntatis impedias, &amp; vincula mentibus effraenatis injicias? at id neque fiori pote&s;t, neque Chri&s;ti &s;ancti&s;&s;imum numen approbat. Voluntarium enim &s;acrificium, non vi et malo coactum ab homini|bus expetit, neque vim mentibus inferri &s;ed voluntates ad &s;tudium verae religionis allici &amp; invitari jubet. . . . . Po&s;tremo quis non vi|det. . . . . . et ita religionem per religionis &s;imulationem undigni&s;&s;i|me violari?&mdash;O&s;orius is &s;aid to have u&s;ed many arguments to di&s;|&s;uade Seba&s;tian from his unfortunate expedition into Africa, and to have felt &s;o deeply the mi&s;eries which befell the Portugueze after that fatal event, that his grief was &s;uppo&s;ed to accelerate his death.&mdash; He expired in 1580, happy, &s;ays De Thou (who celebrates him as a model of Chri&s;tian virtue) that he died ju&s;t before the Spani&s;h army entered Portugal, and thus e&s;caped being a witne&s;s to the de|&s;olation of his country.&mdash;His various works were publi&s;hed at Rome in 1592, by his nephew O&s;orius, in four volumes folio, with a Life of their Author. Among the&s;e are two remarkable productions; the fir&s;t, an admonition to our Queen Elizabeth, ex|horting her to return into the Church of Rome: the &s;econd, an E&s;&s;ay on Glory, written with &s;uch cla&s;&s;ical purity, as to give

birth to a report, that it was not the compo&s;ition of O&s;orius, but the lo&s;t work of Cicero on that &s;ubject.</P>

<P><HI>Iberia's Genius bids ju&s;t Fame allow</HI></P>
<P><HI>An equal wreath to Mariana's brow.</HI>] John Mariana was born 1537, at Talavera (a town in the dioce&s;e of Toledo) as he him&s;elf informs us in his famous E&s;&s;ay <HI>de Rege,</HI> which opens with a beau|tiful romantic de&s;cription of a &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot in that neighbour|hood, where he enjoyed the plea&s;ures of literary retirement with his friend Calderon, a Mini&s;ter of Toledo; who&s;e death he mentions in the &s;ame E&s;&s;ay, commemorating his learning and his virtues in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing terms of affectionate admiration.&mdash;Mariana was admitted into the order of Je&s;uits at the age of 17. He travelled afterwards into Italy and France, and returning into Spain in 1574, &s;ettled at Toledo, and died there in the 87th year of his age, 1624. &mdash;Hearing it frequently regretted, in the cour&s;e of his travels, that there was no General Hi&s;tory of his country, he engaged in that great work on his return; and publi&s;hed it in Latin at Toledo, 1592, with a dedication to Philip the IId; where he &s;peaks of his own performance with mode&s;ty and manly freedom, and perhaps with as little flattery as ever appeared in any addre&s;s of that na|ture, to a Monarch continually fed with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation.&mdash; This elaborate work he tran&s;lated into Spani&s;h, but, as he him&s;elf declares, with all the freedom of an original author. He publi&s;hed his Ver&s;ion in 1601, with an addre&s;s to Philip the IIId, in which he laments the decline of Learning in his country, and declares he had him&s;elf executed that work from his apprehen&s;ion of its being mangled by an ignorant Tran&s;lator. He had clo&s;ed his Hi&s;|tory (which begins with the fir&s;t peopling of Spain) with the death of Ferdinand, in 1516; but in a &s;ub&s;equent edition, in 1617,
<PB N="137" REF="137">
he added to it a &s;hort &s;ummary of events to the year 1612: but in the year before he fir&s;t publi&s;hed the Spani&s;h Ver&s;ion of his Hi&s;|tory, he addre&s;&s;ed al&s;o, to the young Monarch Philip the IIId, his famous E&s;&s;ay, which I have mentioned, and which was publicly burnt at Paris, about 20 years after its publication, on the &s;uppo|&s;ition that it had excited Ravaillac to the murder of Henry the IVth; though it was a&s;&s;erted, with great probability, by the Je|&s;uits, that the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had never &s;een the book.&mdash;It is true, indeed, that Mariana, in this E&s;&s;ay, occa&s;ionally defends Clement the Monk, who &s;tabbed Henry the IIId; and it is very remarkable, that he grounds this defence, not on the bigotted tenets of a Prie&s;t, who thinks every thing lawful for the intere&s;t of his church, but on tho&s;e &s;ublime principles of civil liberty, with which an antient Ro|man would have vindicated the dagger of Brutus. Indeed, this E&s;&s;ay contains &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages on Government, which would not have di&s;honoured even Cicero him&s;elf; but, it mu&s;t be owned, they are grievou&s;ly di&s;graced by the la&s;t chapter of the Work, which breathes a furious &s;pirit of eccle&s;ia&s;tical intolerance, and yet clo&s;es with the&s;e mild and mode&s;t expre&s;&s;ions: No&s;trum de regno et Regis in&s;titutione judicium forta&s;&s;e non omnibus placeat; qui volet &s;e|quatur, aut &s;uo potius &s;tet, &s;i potioribus argumentis nitatur, de quibus rebus tantopere a&s;&s;everavi in his libris, eas nunquam veriores quam alienam &s;ententiam affirmabo. Pote&s;t enim non &s;olum mihi aliud, aliud aliis videri, &s;ed et mihi ip&s;i alio tempore. Suam qui&s;|que &s;ententiam per me &s;equatur . . . et . . qui no&s;tra leget . . . me|mor conditionis humanae, &s;i quid erratum e&s;t, pio &s;tudio rempub|licam juvandi veniam benignus concedat et facilis.&mdash;This is not the only work of Mariana which fell under a public pro&s;cription; he was him&s;elf per&s;ecuted, and &s;uffered a year's impri&s;onment, for a treati&s;e, which &s;eems to have been dictated by the pure&s;t love to his country; it was again&s;t the pernicious practice of deba&s;ing the public coin, and as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to reflect on the Duke of Ler|ma, called the Sejanus of Spain, it expo&s;ed the Author, about the
<PB N="138" REF="138">
year 1609, to the per&s;ecution of that vindictive Mini&s;ter; from which it does not appear how he e&s;caped.&mdash;Indeed the accounts of Mariana's life are very imperfect: Bayle, whom I have chiefly fol|lowed, mentions a life of him by De Vargas, which he could not procure. I have &s;ought after this Biographer with the &s;ame ill &s;ucce&s;s, as I wi&s;hed to give a more perfect account of this great Author, who&s;e per&s;onal Hi&s;tory is little known among us, though it is far from being unworthy of attention.</P>

<P><HI>The liberal &s;pirit of Thuanus ro&s;e.</HI>] James Augu&s;tus De Thou was the younge&s;t &s;on of Chri&s;topher De Thou, Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of the Parliament of Paris, and born in that city, 1553. His own Me|moirs give a plea&s;ing account of the early activity of his mind.&mdash; As his health, during his childhood, was &s;o tender and infirm, that his parents rather re&s;trained him from the u&s;ual &s;tudies of his age, he devoted much of his time to drawing, and copied with a pen the engravings of Albert Durer, before he was ten years old. At that age he was &s;ettled in the college of Burgundy; but this plan of his education was &s;oon interrupted by a fever, in which his life was de&s;paired of, and in which the mother of his future friend, the Duke of Montpen&s;ier, watched him with an attention &s;ingularly happy, after his phy&s;icians and his parents had con&s;idered him as dead. In a few years after his recovery, he repaired to Or|leans to &s;tudy the civil law; from thence he was drawn to Valence in Dauphiny, by the reputation of Cujacius, who was then reading lectures there; on his road he embraced an opportunity of hearing Hotoman, the celebrated author of Franco-Gallia, who was read|ing lectures al&s;o at Bourges.&mdash;During his re&s;idence at Valence, he contracted a friend&s;hip with Jo&s;eph Scaliger, which he cultivated through life.&mdash;In 1572, his father recalled him to Paris, ju&s;t be|fore the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew.&mdash;He mentions in his Me|moirs
<PB N="139" REF="139">
the horrors which he felt in &s;eeing a very &s;mall part of that bloody &s;cene!&mdash;He re&s;ided in the hou&s;e of his uncle Nicholas De Thou, promoted to the bi&s;hopric of Chartres: he was then de&s;igned him&s;elf for the church; and, beginning to collect his celebrated library, applied him&s;elf particularly to the Civil Law, and to Gre|cian literature.</P>
<P>He travelled into Italy in 1573, with Paul De Foix, going on an emba&s;&s;y to the Pope and the Italian Princes. Of De Foix, he gives the mo&s;t engaging character, and &s;peaks with great plea&s;ure of the literary entertainment and advantages which he derived from this expedition.&mdash;He returned to Paris, and devoted him&s;elf again to his &s;tudies, in the following year.&mdash;On the di&s;&s;entions in the Court of France, in 1576, he was employed to negotiate with the Mare&s;chal Montmorency, and engage him to interpo&s;e his good offices to pre|vent the civil war; which he for &s;ome time effected.&mdash;The &s;ame year he vi&s;ited the Low Countries, and on his return was appointed to a public office, on which he entered with that extreme diffidence which is &s;o natural to a delicate mind.</P>
<P>In 1579 he travelled again, with his elder brother, who was &s;ent by his phy&s;icians to the baths of Plombieres in Lorrain: from hence he made a &s;hort excur&s;ion into Germany, and was received there with the jovial ho&s;pitality of that country, which he de&s;cribes in a very lively manner.&mdash;But affection &s;oon recalled him to Plom|bieres, to attend his infirm brother to Paris, who died there in a few months after their return.</P>
<P>In 1580, on the plague's appearing in the capital, our Hi&s;torian retired into Touraine, and after vi&s;iting the principal places in Normandy, returned to Paris in the winter.&mdash;In the following year, he was of the number cho&s;en from the Parliament of Paris to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in Guienne, as two eccle&s;ia&s;tics were included in that commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;In this expedition he embraced every oppor|tunity of preparing the materials of his Hi&s;tory, &s;eeking, as he ever did, the &s;ociety of all per&s;ons eminent for their talents, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

He &s;peaks with great plea&s;ure of a vi&s;it which be paid of this time to the celebrated Montaigne, whom he calls a man of a mo&s;t liberal mind, and to|tally uninfected with the &s;pirit of party.&mdash;After various excur&s;ions, he was now returning to Paris, when he received the unexpected news of his father's death, an event which affected him mo&s;t deeply, as filial affection was one of the &s;triking characteri&s;tics of his amia|ble mind.&mdash;He con&s;oled him&s;elf under the affliction of having been unable to pay his duty to his dying parent, by erecting a magnifi|cent monument to his memory, expre&s;&s;ive of the high veneration in which he ever held his virtues.&mdash;He engaged again in public bu&s;ine&s;s, devoting his intervals of lei&s;ure to mathematical &s;tudies, and to the compo&s;ition of Latin ver&s;e, which &s;eems to have been his favourite amu&s;ement. In 1584, he publi&s;hed his Poem, de re Accipitraria, which, though much celebrated by the critics of his age, has fallen, like the &s;ubject of which it treats, into univer&s;al neglect.&mdash;In 1585, he bid adieu to the Court, on finding him&s;elf treated with &s;uch a degree of coldne&s;s, as his ingenuous nature could not &s;ubmit to; and being eager to advance in his great work, which he had already brought down to the reign of Francis II.&mdash; In 1587, having been often pre&s;&s;ed to marry by his family, and being ab&s;olved from his eccle&s;ia&s;tical engagements for that purpo&s;e, he made choice of Marie Barban&s;on, of an antient and noble fa|mily; but as her parents were &s;u&s;pected of a &s;ecret inclination to the reformed religion, it was thought proper that the lady &s;hould undergo a kind of expiation in a private conference with two Ca|tholic Divines; a circum&s;tance of which the great Hi&s;torian &s;peaks with an air of triumph in his Memoirs, as a proof of his own in|violable attachment to the faith of his fathers. In 1588, he lo&s;t his affectionate mother; who is de&s;cribed, by her &s;on, as meeting death with the &s;ame gentlene&s;s and tranquillity of mind, by which her life was di&s;tingui&s;hed. When the violence of the league had reduced Henry the IIId to abandon Paris, our Hi&s;torian was &s;ent
<PB N="141" REF="141">
into Normandy to confirm the magi&s;trates of that province in their adherence to the King.&mdash;He afterwards met Henry at Blois, and while he was receiving from him in private &s;ome commi&s;&s;ions to execute at Paris, the King pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and &s;eemed preparing to impart to him &s;ome important &s;ecret; but after a long pau&s;e di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him without revealing it.&mdash;This &s;ecret was afterwards &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the projected a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Duke of Gui&s;e: the &s;uppo&s;ition is probable, and it is al&s;o probable, that if Henry had then revealed his de&s;ign, the manly virtue and eloquence of De Thou might have led him to relinqui&s;h that infamous and fatal mea&s;ure.&mdash;He was, however, &s;o far from &s;u&s;pecting the intended crime of the King, that when he fir&s;t heard at Paris, that Gui&s;e was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, he believed it a fal&s;e rumour, only &s;pread by that faction, to introduce, what he &s;uppo&s;ed had really happened, the murder of the King.&mdash;In the commotions which the death of Gui&s;e produced in Paris, many in&s;ults were offered to the family of De Thou: his wife was impri&s;oned for a day in the Ba&s;tile; but ob|taining her liberty, &s;he e&s;caped from the city in a mean habit, at|tended by her hu&s;band, di&s;gui&s;ed al&s;o in the dre&s;s of a &s;oldier. Hav|ing &s;ent his wife in &s;afety into Picardy, he repaired to the King, who was almo&s;t de&s;erted, at Blois; and was greatly in&s;trumental in per&s;uading his ma&s;ter to his coalition with Henry of Navarre.&mdash; The King determined to e&s;tabli&s;h a Parliament at Tours, and De Thou was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to be the Pre&s;ident of this a&s;&s;embly; but with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty he declined this honour, and cho&s;e rather to engage with his friend Mr. de Schom|berg, in an expedition to Germany for the &s;ervice of the King.&mdash; He was at fir&s;t de&s;igned for the emba&s;&s;y to Elizabeth, but at the reque&s;t of Schomberg declined the appointment, and accompanied his friend.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t received intelligence of the King's death at Venice, where he had formed an intimacy with the celebrated Arnauld d'O&s;&s;at, at that time Secretary to the Cardinal Joyeu&s;e.&mdash;In con|&s;equence
<PB N="142" REF="142">
of their conver&s;ation on this event, and the calamities of France, De Thou addre&s;&s;ed a Latin Poem to his friend, which he afterwards printed at Tours.</P>
<P>In leaving Italy, he pa&s;&s;ed a few days at Padua, with his friend Vicenzio Pinelli; from whom he collected many particulars con|cerning the mo&s;t eminent Italian and Spani&s;h Authors, whom he determined to celebrate in his Hi&s;tory, in the hope, as he hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;es, that his liberal attention to foreign merit might entitle his own Works to the favour both of Italy and Spain; but he was di&s;appointed in this fair expectation, and laments the ingratitude which he experienced from both.</P>
<P>On his return to France, he was graciou&s;ly received by Henry the IVth; and in giving that Prince an account of Italy, &s;ugge&s;ted to him the idea of a connexion with Mary of Medicis. After the battle of Ivry, he complimented the King in a &s;hort Poem, which clo&s;es with the following lines:
<Q><L>Au&s;piciis vulgo peraguntur praelia regum,</L>
<L>Perque duces illis gloria multa venit:</L>
<L>Tu vincis virtute tua, nec militis haec e&s;t;</L>
<L>I&s;ta tibi propria laurea parta manu.</L></Q>
As he was travelling, &s;oon afterwards, with his wife and family, which he de&s;igned to &s;ettle at Tours, his party was intercepted by the enemy, and he was obliged to abandon his wife and her atten|dants, being prevailed on by their intreaties to &s;ecure his own e&s;cape by the &s;wiftne&s;s of his hor&s;e.&mdash;He repaired to the King at Gi&s;ors, and &s;oon obtained the re&s;titution of his family.&mdash;On the death of Amyot, Bi&s;hop of Auxerre, well known by his various Tran&s;lations from the Greek language, the King appointed De Thou his Principal Librarian. In 1592, our Hi&s;torian was very near failing a victim to the plague, but happily &s;truggled through that dangerous di&s;temper by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two &s;kilful phy&s;icians, who
<PB N="143" REF="143">
attended him at Tours.&mdash;In 1593, he began the mo&s;t important part of his Hi&s;tory; and under this year he introduces in his Memoirs a long and &s;pirited Poem addre&s;&s;ed to Po&s;terity, in which he enters into a ju&s;tification of him&s;elf again&s;t the malignant attacks, which the manly and virtuous freedom of his writings had drawn upon him. It concludes with the following animated appeal to the &s;pi|rit of his father:
<Q><L>Vos O majorum Cineres, teque optime longis</L>
<L>Soliciti genitor defuncte laboribus aevi,</L>
<L>Te&s;tor, pro patria nullas regnique &s;alute</L>

<L>No&s;traque &s;ub tacitos ibit fama integra manes.</L></Q></P>
<P>In 1594, he &s;ucceeded his uncle Augu&s;tin as Pre&s;ident a Mor|tier.&mdash;In 1596, he lo&s;t his valuable and learned friend Pithou, who fir&s;t &s;olicited him to undertake his Hi&s;tory, and had greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the pro&s;ecution of that laborious work.&mdash;How deeply the affectionate mind of De Thou was wounded by this event, appears from his long letter to Ca&s;aubon on the occa&s;ion.&mdash;In 1597, he be|gan to be engaged in tho&s;e negotiations, which happily terminated in the famous edict of Nantes.&mdash;It may be proper to ob&s;erve here, that De Thou was accu&s;ed of being a Calvini&s;t, in con&s;equence of the part he acted in this bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as from the moderate tenor of his Hi&s;tory; and it is remarkable, that Sully &s;eems in his Memoirs to countenance the accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>In 1601, our Hi&s;torian &s;uffered a &s;evere dome&s;tic affliction in the lo&s;s of his wife.&mdash;He celebrated her virtues, and his own con|nubial
<PB N="144" REF="144">
affection, in a Latin Poem: with this, and a Greek epitaph on the &s;ame lady, written by Ca&s;aubon, he terminates the Com|mentary of his own Life, of which the preceding account is an imperfect abridgment.&mdash;His fir&s;t wife leaving him no children, he married, in 1603, Ga&s;parde de la Cha&s;tre, an accompli&s;hed lady of a noble family; who having brought him three &s;ons and three daughters, died at the age of 39, 1616.&mdash;There is a fine letter of Daniel Hein&s;ius, addre&s;&s;ed to our author on this occa&s;ion, exhorting him to fortitude: but this unexpected dome&s;tic calamity, and the mi&s;eries which befel his country on the murder of Henry the Great, are &s;aid to have wounded his feeling mind &s;o deeply, as to occa&s;ion his death, which happened in May 1617.&mdash;Under the re|gency of Mary of Medicis, he had been one of the Directors ge|neral of the finances, maintaining the &s;ame reputation for integrity in that department, which he had ever pre&s;erved in his judicial capacity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of his Hi&s;tory appeared in 1604, with a Preface addre&s;&s;ed to Henry IV, ju&s;tly celebrated for its liberal and manly &s;pirit.&mdash;But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the following compliment to the King&mdash;Quicquid de ea &s;tatueris ju&s;&s;eri&s;ve, pro divinae vocis oraculo mihi erit&mdash;was more than even that mo&s;t amiable of Monarchs de|&s;erved, as he ungratefully de&s;erted the cau&s;e of our Hi&s;torian, in &s;uffering his work to be pro&s;cribed by the public cen&s;ure of Rome in 1609, as De Thou plainly intimates, in the following pa&s;&s;age from one of his letters, written 1611:&mdash;Publicata prima parte [Hi&s;|toriae meae] immane quam commoti &s;unt plerique, &s;ive invidi, &s;ive factio&s;i, qui mox proceres quo&s;dam, qui per &s;e in talibus rebus nihil vident, per calumnias artificio&s;e confictas, ut &s;cis, in me concita|verunt, remque e ve&s;tigio Romam detulerunt, et auctore maligne exagitato, facile pervicerunt, ut moro&s;i illi cen&s;ores omnia mea &s;ini&s;tre&punc; interpretarentur, et praejudicio per&s;onae opus integrum, cujus ne tertiam quidem partem legerant, praecipitato ordine damnarent.

Ita in aula omni ope de&s;titutus, facile Romae op|pre&s;&s;us &s;um.&mdash;De Thou was preparing a new edition of his Hi&s;|tory at the time, of his death.&mdash;His pa&s;&s;ion for Latin ver&s;e appears never to have for&s;aken him, as the late&s;t effu&s;ion of his pen was a little poem de&s;criptive of his la&s;t illne&s;s, and an epitaph in which he draws the following ju&s;t character of him&s;elf:
<Q><L>Mihi veritatis cura vitae commodis</L>
<L>Antiquiorque charitatibus fuit,</L>
<L>Nullique facto, voce nulli injurius,</L>
<L>Injurias patienter aliorum tuli.</L>

<P>The pious paternal prayer in the la&s;t line was very far from being crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. Francis, the elde&s;t &s;on of De Thou, fell a victim to the re&s;entment which Cardinal Richelieu is &s;aid to have conceived again&s;t him, from a pa&s;&s;age in the great Hi&s;torian, reflecting on the Richelieu family.&mdash;He was beheaded at Lyons, 1642, for having been privy to a con&s;piracy again&s;t the Cardinal. &mdash;Voltaire, with his u&s;ual philanthropy and &s;pirit, inveighs again&s;t the iniquity of this execution, in his Melanges, tom. iii.&mdash;The cu|rious reader may find a particular account of this tragical event in the la&s;t volume of that noble edition of Thuanus, which was pub|li&s;hed under the au&s;pices of Dr. Mead, and does great honour to

This will particularly ap|pear from a few lines in his character of Henry.&mdash;"This King, to &s;peak of him in terms equal to his de&s;erving, was one of the be&s;t &s;ort of wonders, a wonder for wi&s;e men.

<P>The Critics are much divided on this pa&s;&s;age: I have followed an interpretation very different from that adopted by a learned and judicious author, who has lately entered into a thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all the anecdotes relating to this celebrated Conqueror, in a very elaborate and &s;pirited di&s;&s;ertation, entitled, "Examen critique des Hi&s;toriens d'Alexandre," Paris, 4to, 1775. But there is great probability in his conjecture, that the name of Ari&s;tobulus has &s;lipt into the &s;tory by &s;ome mi&s;take; and that the &s;ycophant &s;o ju&s;tly reprimanded was One&s;icritus, who attended the hero of Ma|cedon in quality of Hi&s;toriographer, and is cen&s;ured by the judi|cious Strabo as the mo&s;t fabulous of all the Writers who have engaged in his Hi&s;tory.
