<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible but the whole Attention of the Reader mu&s;t be awaken'd in this Book: The Heroes of the two Armies are now to encounter, all the foregoing Battels have been but &s;o many Preludes and Under-actions, in order to this great Event: Wherein the whole Fate of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy</HI> is to be decided by the Sword of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Hector.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Book, which of the whole Iliad appears to me the mo&s;t charming. It a&s;&s;embles in it all that can be imagined of great and important on the one hand, and of tender and melancholy on the other. <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> are here wrought up in Perfection, and if the Reader is not &s;en&s;ible of both in a high degree, either he is utterly void of all Ta&s;te, or the Tran&s;lator of all Skill, in Poetry.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 51. <HI>The Speech of</HI> Priam <HI>to</HI> Hector.]</Q> The Poet has entertain'd us all along with various Scenes of Slaughter and Horrour: He now changes to the pathetick, and fills the Mind of the Reader with tender Sorrows. <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob|&s;erves that <HI>Priam</HI> preludes to his Words by Actions ex|pre&s;&s;ive of Mi&s;ery: The unhappy Orator introduces his Speech to <HI>Hector</HI> with Groans and Tears, and rending his hoary Hair. The Father and the King plead with <HI>Hector</HI> to pre&s;erve his Life and his Country. He repre&s;ents his own Age, and the Lo&s;s of many of his Children; and adds, that if <HI>Hector</HI> falls, he &s;hould then be incon&s;olable, and the Empire of <HI>Troy</HI> at an end.</P>
<P>It is a piece of great Judgment in <HI>Homer</HI> to make the Fall of <HI>Troy</HI> to depend upon the Death of <HI>Hector:</HI> The Poet does not openly tell us that <HI>Troy</HI> was taken by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> but that the Reader might not be unacquainted with what happen'd after the Period of his Poem, he gives us to under|&s;tand in this Speech, that the City was taken, and that <HI>Priam,</HI> his Wives, his Sons and Daughters, were either kill'd or made Slaves.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 114. <HI>The Speech of</HI> Hecuba,]</Q> The Speech of <HI>He|cuba</HI> opens with as much Tenderne&s;s as that of <HI>Priam:</HI> The Circum&s;tance in particular of her &s;hewing that Brea&s;t to her Son which had &s;u&s;tain'd his Infancy, is highly moving: It is a &s;ilent kind of Oratory, and prepares the Heart to li&s;ten, by prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Eye in favour of the Speaker.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> takes notice of the Difference between the Speeches of <HI>Priam</HI> and <HI>Hecuba: Priam</HI> di&s;&s;uades him from the Combat by enumerating not only the Lo&s;s of his own Family, but of his whole Country: <HI>Hecuba</HI> dwells entirely upon his &s;ingle Death; this is a great Beauty in the Poet, to make <HI>Priam</HI> a Father to his whole Countrey; but to de|&s;cribe the Fondne&s;s of the Mother as prevailing over all o|ther Con&s;iderations, and to mention that only which chiefly affects her.</P>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 140. <HI>The Soliloquy of</HI> Hector.]</Q> There is much Greatne&s;s in the Sentiments of this whole Soliloquy. <HI>Hector</HI> prefers Death to an ignominious Life: He knows how to die with Glory, but not how to live with Di&s;honour. The Reproach of <HI>Polydamas</HI> affects him; the Scandals of the meane&s;t People have an Influence on his Thoughts.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable that he does not &s;ay, he fears the In&s;ults of the braver <HI>Trojans,</HI> but of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s only. Men of Merit are always the mo&s;t candid; but others are ever for bringing all Men to a Level with them&s;elves. They cannot
<PB N="41" REF="41">
bear that any one &s;hould be &s;o bold as to excel, and are ready to pull him down to them, upon the lea&s;t Mi&s;carriage. This Sentiment is perfectly fine, and agreeable to the way of thinking natural to a great and &s;en&s;ible Mind.</P>
<P>There is a very beautiful Break in the middle of this Speech. <HI>Hector</HI>'s Mind fluctuates every way, he is calling a Council in his own Brea&s;t, and con&s;ulting what Method to pur&s;ue: He doubts if he &s;hould not propo&s;e Terms of Peace to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and grants him very large Conce&s;&s;ions; but of a &s;udden he checks him&s;elf, and leaves the Sentence unfini&s;h'd. The Paragraph runs thus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If, &s;ays <HI>Hector,</HI> I &s;hould offer him the large&s;t Conditions, give all that <HI>Troy</HI> contains&mdash;</Q> There he &s;tops, and immediately &s;ub|joins, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But why do I delude my&s;elf, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>'Tis evident from this Speech that the Power of making Peace was in <HI>Hector</HI>'s Hands: For unle&s;s <HI>Priam</HI> had tran&s;|fer'd it to him he could not have made the&s;e Propo&s;itions. So that it was <HI>Hector</HI> who broke the Treaty in the third Book; (where the very &s;ame Conditions were propos'd by <HI>Agamemnon.</HI>) 'Tis <HI>Hector</HI> therefore that is guilty, he is blameable in continuing the War, and involving the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Trojans</HI> in Blood. This Conduct in <HI>Homer</HI> was nece&s;|&s;ary; he ob&s;erves a poetical Ju&s;tice, and &s;hews us that <HI>Hector</HI> is a Criminal, before he brings him to Death. <HI>Eu&s;tathius.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 180. <HI>Struck by &s;ome God, he fears, recedes, and flies.</HI>]</Q> I doubt not mo&s;t Readers are &s;hock'd at the Flight of <HI>Hector:</HI> It is indeed a high Exaltation of <HI>Achilles</HI> (which was the Poets chief Care, as he was his chief Hero) that &s;o brave a Man as <HI>He|ctor</HI> dur&s;t not &s;tand him. While <HI>Achilles</HI> was at a di&s;tance he had fortify'd his Heart with noble Re&s;olutions, but at his approach they all vani&s;h, and he flies. This (as exceptionable as &s;ome may think it) may yet be allow'd to be a true Portrait of human Nature; for Di&s;tance, as it le&s;&s;ens all Objects, &s;o it does our Fears: But where inevitable Danger approaches, the &s;toute&s;t Hearts will feel &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions at certain Fate. It was the Saying of one of the brave&s;t Men in this Age, to one who told him he fear'd nothing, <HI>Shew me but a certain Danger, and I &s;hall be as much afraid as any of you.</HI> I don't ab&s;olute|ly pretend to ju&s;tify this Pa&s;&s;age in every point, but only to have thus much granted me, that <HI>Hector</HI> was in this de&s;pe|rate Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It will not be found in the whole Iliad, that <HI>Hector</HI> ever thought him&s;elf a Match for <HI>Achilles. Homer</HI> (to keep this in our Minds) had ju&s;t now made <HI>Priam</HI> tell him (as a thing known, for certainly <HI>Priam</HI> would not in&s;ult him at that time) that there was no Compari&s;on between his own Strength, and that of his Antagoni&s;t.<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> we may ob&s;erve with <HI>Dacier,</HI> the Degrees by which <HI>Homer</HI> prepares this Incident. In the 18th Book the mere Sight and Voice of <HI>Achilles,</HI> unarm'd, has terrify'd and put the whole <HI>Trojan</HI> Army into Di&s;order. In the 19th, the very Sound of the coele&s;tial Arms given him by <HI>Vulcan,</HI> has affrighted his own <HI>Myrmidons</HI> as they &s;tand about him. In the 20th, he has been upon the point of killing <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and <HI>Hector</HI> him&s;elf was not &s;av'd from him but by <HI>Apollo</HI>'s in|terpo&s;ing. In that and the following Book, he makes an incredible Slaughter of all that oppo&s;e him; he overtakes
<PB N="44" REF="44">
mo&s;t of tho&s;e that fly from him, and <HI>Priam</HI> him&s;elf opens the Gates of <HI>Troy</HI> to receive the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Hector</HI> &s;tays, not that he hopes to overcome <HI>A|chilles,</HI> but becau&s;e Shame and the dread of Reproach forbid him to re-enter the City; a Shame (&s;ays <HI>Eustathius</HI>) which was a Fault, that betray'd him out of his Life, and ruin'd his Countrey. Nay, <HI>Homer</HI> adds farther, that he only &s;tay'd by the immediate <HI>Will of Heaven,</HI> intoxicated and irre&s;i&s;tibly bound down by <HI>Fate.</HI><Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 496.] <HI>Unworthy of him&s;elf, and of the Dead.</HI>]</Q> This Inhumanity of <HI>Achilles</HI> in dragging the dead Body of <HI>Hector,</HI> has been &s;everely (and I think indeed not without &s;ome Ju&s;tice) cen&s;ur'd by &s;everal both Ancients and Moderns. <HI>Plato</HI> in his third Book <HI>de Republica,</HI> &s;peaks of it with Dete|&s;tation: But methinks it is a great Inju&s;tice to <HI>Homer</HI> to re|flect upon the Morals of the Author him&s;elf, for things which he only paints as the Manners of a vicious Hero.</P>
<P>It may ju&s;tly be ob&s;erv'd in general of all <HI>Plato</HI>'s Objecti|ons again&s;t <HI>Homer,</HI> that they are &s;till in a View to Morality, con&s;tantly blaming him for repre&s;enting ill and immoral Things as the Opinions or Actions of his Per&s;ons. To every one of the&s;e one general An&s;wer will &s;erve, which is, that <HI>Homer</HI> as often de&s;cribes ill things, in order to make us avoid them, as good, to induce us to follow them (which is the Ca&s;e with all Writers whatever.) But what is extremely remarkable, and evidently &s;hews the Inju&s;tice of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Cen|&s;ure is, that many of tho&s;e very Actions for which he blames him are expre&s;&s;ly characterized and marked by <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf as evil and dete&s;table, by previous Expre&s;&s;ions or Cautions. Thus in the pre&s;ent Place, before he de&s;cribes this Barbarity of <HI>Achilles,</HI> he tells us it was a mo&s;t unworthy Action.<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q> When <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;acrifices the twelve young <HI>Trojans</HI> in l. 23. he repeats the &s;ame Words.

<P>It is difficult to de&s;cribe particularly every Ornament mention'd by the Poet, but I &s;hall lay before my female Readers the Bi&s;hop's Explanation.

<P>The Ladies cannot but be pleas'd to &s;ee &s;o much Learn|ing and <HI>Greek</HI> upon this important Subject.</P>

I will venture to &s;ay, there are not in all <HI>Homer</HI> any Lines more worthy of him: The Beauty of this tender and Compa&s;&s;ionate Image is &s;uch, that it even makes amends for the many cruel ones, with which the Iliad is too much &s;tained.

<P>THIS, and the following Book, which contain the De&s;cription of the Funeral of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and other Matters relating to <HI>Hector,</HI> are undoubtedly &s;uperadded to the grand Cata&s;trophe of the Poem; for the Story is compleatly fini&s;h'd with the Death of that Hero in the 22^d Book. Many judicious Criticks have been of opinion that <HI>Homer</HI> is blameable for protract|ing it. <HI>Virgil</HI> clo&s;es the whole Scene of Action with the Death of <HI>Turnus,</HI> and leaves the re&s;t to be imagin'd by the Mind of the Reader: He does not draw the Picture at full Length, but delineates it &s;o far, that we cannot fail of ima|gining the whole Draught. There is however one thing to be &s;aid in favour of <HI>Homer</HI> which may perhaps ju&s;tify him in his Method, that what he undertook was to paint the <HI>An|ger of</HI> Achilles: And as that Anger does not die with <HI>Hector,</HI> but per&s;ecutes his very remains, &s;o the Poet &s;till keeps up to his Subject; nay it &s;eems to require that he &s;hould carry down the Relation of that Re&s;entment, which is the Foun|dation of his Poem, till it is fully &s;atisfy'd: And as this &s;ur|vives <HI>Hector,</HI> and gives the Poet an Opportunity of &s;till &s;hewing many &s;ad Effects of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Anger, the two fol|lowing Books may be thought not to be Excre&s;cencies, but e&s;&s;ential to the Poem.</P>

<P>The Winds are all together in the Cave of <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> which may imply that they were there as at their general Ren|dezvous; or that the Nature of all the Winds is the &s;ame; or that the We&s;tern Wind is in that Countrey the mo&s;t con&s;tant, and con&s;equently it may be &s;aid that at &s;uch Sea|&s;ons all the Winds are a&s;&s;embled in one Corner, or rendezvous with <HI>Zephyrus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Iris</HI> will not enter the Cave: It is the Nature of the Rain|bow to be &s;tretch'd entirely upon the Surface, and therefore this Fiction is agreeable to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>When <HI>Iris</HI> &s;ays that the Gods are partaking Hecatombs in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> it is to be remember'd that the Gods are repre|&s;ented there in the fir&s;t Book, before the Scenes of War were open'd, and now they are clo&s;ed, they return thither. <HI>Eu&s;tathius&mdash;</HI>Thus <HI>Homer</HI> makes the Anger of his Hero &s;o important, that it rouz'd Heaven to Arms, and now when it is almo&s;t appeas'd, <HI>Achilles</HI> as it were gives Peace to the Gods.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 320. <HI>The Games for</HI> Patroclus.]</Q> The Conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> in enlarging upon the Games at the Funeral of <HI>Pa|troclus</HI> is very judicious: There had undoubtedly been &s;uch Honours paid to &s;everal Heroes during this War, as appears from a Pa&s;&s;age in the ninth Book, where <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to en|hance the Value of the Hor&s;es which he offers <HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;ays, that any Per&s;on would be rich that had Trea&s;ures equal to the Value of the Prizes they had won; which Races mu&s;t have been run during the Seige: for had they been before it, the Hor&s;es would now have been too old to be of any Value, this being the tenth Year of the War. But he Poet pa&s;&s;es all tho&s;e Games over in Silence, and re&s;erves them for this Sea&s;on; not only in honour of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> but al&s;o of his Hero <HI>Achilles;</HI> who exhibits Games to a whole Army; great Ge|nerals are Candidates for the Prizes, and he him&s;elf &s;its the Judge and Arbitrator: Thus in Peace as well as War the Poet maintains the Superiority of the Character of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>But there is another Rea&s;on why the Poet deferr'd to relate any Games that were exhibited at any preceding Funerals: The Death of <HI>Patroclus</HI> was the mo&s;t eminent Period; and con&s;equently the mo&s;t proper Time for &s;uch Games.</P>
<P>'Tis farther ob&s;ervable, that he chu&s;es this peculiar Time with great Judgment. When the Fury of the War rag'd, the Army could not well have found Lei&s;ure for the Games, and they might have met with Interruption from the Enemy: But <HI>Hector</HI> being dead, all <HI>Troy</HI> is in Confu&s;ion: They are in too great a Con&s;ternation to make any Attempts, and therefore the Poet could not po&s;&s;ibly have cho&s;en a more happy Opportunity. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<PB N="140" REF="139">
If I may own my private Opinion, there is in general more Variety of natural Incidents, and a more lively Picture of natural Pa&s;&s;ions, in the Games and Per&s;ons of <HI>Homer.</HI> On the other hand, there &s;eems to me more Art, Contrivance, Gradation, and a greater Pomp of Ver&s;e in tho&s;e of <HI>Virgil.</HI> The Chariot-Race is that which <HI>Homer</HI> has mo&s;t labour'd, of which <HI>Virgil</HI> being &s;en&s;ible, he judiciou&s;ly avoided the Imi|tation of what he could not improve, and &s;ub&s;tituted in its place the Naval-Cour&s;e, or Ship-Race.

Upon the whole, the De&s;cription of the Sea-Race I think has the more Poetry and Maje&s;ty, that of the Chariots more Nature, and lively Incidents. There is nothing in <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;o picture&s;que, &s;o animated, or which &s;o much marks the Characters, as the Epi&s;odes of <HI>Antilochus</HI> and <HI>Menelaus, Ajax</HI> and <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> with that beautiful Interpo&s;ition of old <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> (&s;o naturally introduc'd into an Affair where one &s;o little expects him.) On the other &s;ide, in <HI>Virgil</HI> the De&s;cri|ption it&s;elf is much nobler; it has &s;omething more o&s;ten|tatiou&s;ly grand, and &s;eems a Spectacle more worthy the Pre|&s;ence of Princes and great Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>In three other Games we find the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet contend|ing openly with the <HI>Grecian.</HI> That of the <HI>Cae&s;tus</HI> is in great part a verbal Tran&s;lation: But it mu&s;t be own'd in favour of <HI>Virgil,</HI> that he has vary'd from <HI>Homer</HI> in the E|vent of the Combate with admirable Judgment and with an Improvement of the Moral. <HI>Epaeus</HI> and <HI>Dares</HI> are de&s;crib'd by both Poets as vain Boa&s;ters; but <HI>Virgil</HI> with more poetical Ju&s;tice puni&s;hes <HI>Dares</HI> for his Arrogance, whereas the Pre|&s;umption and Pride of <HI>Epaeus</HI> is rewarded by <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>On the contrary, in the Foot-Race, I am of opinion that <HI>Homer</HI> has &s;hewn more Judgment and Morality than <HI>Virgil. Ni&s;us</HI> in the latter is unju&s;t to his Adver&s;ary in favour of his Friend <HI>Euryalus;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Euryalus</HI> wins the Race by pal|pable Fraud, and yet the Poet gives him the fir&s;t Prize; whereas <HI>Homer</HI> makes <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> victorious, purely thro' the Mi&s;|chance of <HI>Ajax,</HI> and his own Piety in invoking <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;hooting is al&s;o a direct Copy, but with the Addi|tion of two Circum&s;tances which make a beautiful Gradation. In <HI>Homer</HI> the fir&s;t Archer cuts the String that held the Bird, and the other &s;hoots him as he is mounting. In <HI>Virgil</HI> the
<PB N="142" REF="141">
fir&s;t only hits the Ma&s;t which the Bird was fix'd upon, the &s;econd cuts the String, the third &s;hoots him, and the fourth to vaunt the Strength of his Arm directs his Arrow up to Heaven, where it kindles into a Flame, and makes a Pro|digy. This la&s;t is certainly &s;uperior to <HI>Homer</HI> in what they call the <HI>Wonderful:</HI> but what is the Intent or Effect of this Prodigy, or whether a Reader is not at lea&s;t as much &s;ur|prized at it, as at the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Parts in <HI>Homer,</HI> I leave to tho&s;e Criticks who are more inclin'd to find Faults than I am: Nor &s;hall I ob&s;erve upon the many literal Imi|tations in the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet, to object again&s;t which were to derogate from the Merit of tho&s;e fine Pa&s;&s;ages, which <HI>Virgil</HI> was &s;o very &s;en&s;ible of, that he was re&s;olv'd to take them, at any rate, to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There remain in <HI>Homer</HI> three Games untouch'd by <HI>Virgil;</HI> the Wre&s;tling, the &s;ingle Combate, and the <HI>Di&s;cus.</HI> In <HI>Virgil</HI> there is only the <HI>Lu&s;us Trojae</HI> added, which is purely his own, and mu&s;t be confe&s;t to be inimitable: I don't know whether I may be allow'd to &s;ay, it is worth all tho&s;e three of <HI>Homer?</HI></P>
<P>I could not forgive my &s;elf if I omitted to mention in this place the Funeral Games in the &s;ixth <HI>Theba&iuml;d</HI> of <HI>Statius;</HI> it is by much the mo&s;t beautiful Book of that Poem. It's very remarkable, that he has follow'd <HI>Homer</HI> thro' the whole Cour&s;e of his Games: There is the Chariot-Race, the Foot-Race, the <HI>Di&s;cus,</HI> the <HI>Cae&s;tus,</HI> the Wre&s;tling, the &s;ingle Combate (which is put off in the &s;ame manner as in <HI>Homer</HI>) and the Shooting; which la&s;t ends (as in <HI>Virgil</HI>) with a Prodigy: Yet in the particular De&s;criptions of each of the&s;e Games this Poet has not borrow'd from either of his Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, and his Poem is &s;o much the wor&s;e for it.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 14. <HI>What Seas they mea&s;ur'd,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> There is &s;omething very noble in the&s;e Sentiments of <HI>Achilles:</HI> He does not recollect any &s;oft Moments, any Tenderne&s;&s;es that had pa&s;s'd between him and <HI>Patroclus,</HI> but he revolves the many Difficulties, the Toils by Land, and the Dangers by Sea, in which they had been Companions: Thus the Poet on all Occa&s;ions admirably &s;u&s;tains the Character of <HI>Achilles;</HI> when he play'd upon the Harp in the ninth Book, he &s;ung the Atchievements of Kings; and in this place there is an air of Greatne&s;s in his very Sorrows: <HI>Achilles</HI> is as much a Hero when he weeps, as when he fights.</P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Homer</HI> has not e&s;cap'd the Cen&s;ure of <HI>Plato,</HI> who thought it a Diminution to his Character to be
<PB N="196" REF="194">
thus tran&s;ported with Grief; but the Objection will vani&s;h if we remember that all the Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Achilles</HI> are in the ex|treme; his Nature is violent, and it would have been an Out|rage to his general Character to have repre&s;ented him as mourning moderately for his Friend. <HI>Plato</HI> &s;poke more like a Philo&s;opher than a Critick when he blamed the Behaviour of <HI>Achilles</HI> as unmanly: The&s;e Tears would have ill-become <HI>Plato,</HI> but they are graceful in <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides there is &s;omething very in&s;tructive in this whole Repre&s;entation, it &s;hews us the Power of a &s;incere Friend|&s;hip, and &s;oftens and recommends the Character of <HI>Achil|les;</HI> the Violence he us'd towards his Enemy is alleviated by the Sincerity he expre&s;&s;es towards his Friend; he is a ter|rible Enemy, but an amiable Friend.</P>

be introduc'd but when human Means fail, he rejects the In|terpo&s;ition of <HI>Mercury,</HI> makes u&s;e of ordinary Methods, and <HI>Priam</HI> redeems his Son: This gives an Air of Probability to the Relation, at the &s;ame time that it advances the Glory of <HI>Achilles;</HI> for the greate&s;t of his Enemies labours to pur|cha&s;e his Favour, the Gods hold a Con&s;ultation, and a King becomes his Suppliant. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;even Lines, from <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> to <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, have been thought &s;purious by &s;ome of the Ancients: They judg'd it an Indecency that the Godde&s;s of Wi&s;dom and <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;hould be equally inexorable; and that it was below the Maje&s;ty of the Gods to be &s;aid at all to &s;teal. Be&s;ides, &s;ay they, had <HI>Homer</HI> been acquainted with the Judgment of <HI>Paris,</HI> he would undoubtedly have mention'd it before this time in his Poem, and con&s;equently that Story was of a later Invention: And <HI>Aristarchus</HI> affirms that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is a more modern Word, and never known before the Time of <HI>He&s;iod,</HI> who u&s;es it when he &s;peaks of the Daughters of <HI>Praetus;</HI> and adds, that it is appropriated to &s;ignify the Incontinence of Women, and cannot be at all apply'd to Men: Therefore others read the la&s;t Ver&s;e,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q>
The&s;e Objections are entirely gather'd from <HI>Eustathius;</HI> to which we may add, that <HI>Macrobius</HI> &s;eems to have been one of tho&s;e who rejected the&s;e Ver&s;es, &s;ince he affirms that our Author never mentions the Judgment of <HI>Paris.</HI> It may be an&s;wer'd, that the Silence of <HI>Homer</HI> in the foregoing part of the Poem, as to the Judgment of <HI>Paris,</HI> is no Argument that he was ignorant of that Story: Perhaps he might think it mo&s;t proper to unfold the Cau&s;e of the De&s;truction of <HI>Troy</HI> in the Conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Ilias;</HI> that the Reader &s;eeing the Wrong done, and the Puni&s;hment of that Wrong immedi|ately following, might acknowledge the Ju&s;tice of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Rea&s;on will be an an&s;wer to the Objection re|lating to the Anger of <HI>Pallas:</HI> Wi&s;dom cannot be &s;atisfy'd without Ju&s;tice, and con&s;equently <HI>Pallas</HI> ought not to cea&s;e from Re&s;entment, till <HI>Troy</HI> has &s;uffer'd the De&s;erts of her Crimes.</P>

I cannot think that the Objection about the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is of any Weight; the Date of Words is utterly uncertain, and as no one has been able to determine the Ages of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>He&s;iod,</HI> &s;o neither can any Per&s;on be a&s;&s;ured that &s;uch Words were not in u&s;e in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Days.</P>

One may &s;ee from this alone that he was far from de&s;igning his Hero a virtuous Chara|cter, yet the Poet artfully introduces <HI>Apollo</HI> in the mid&s;t of his Reproaches, intermingling the Hero's Prai&s;es with his Blemi&s;hes: <HI>Brave tho' he be,</HI> &amp;c. Thus what is the real Merit of <HI>Achilles</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from what is blameable in his Character, and we &s;ee <HI>Apollo,</HI> or the God of Wi&s;dom, is no le&s;s impartial than ju&s;t in his Repre&s;entation of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 114. <HI>And wept her god like Son's approaching Doom.</HI>]</Q> The&s;e words are very artfully in&s;erted by the Poet. The Poem could not proceed to the Death of <HI>Achilles</HI> without breaking the Action; and therefore to &s;atisfy the Curio&s;ity of the Reader concerning the Fate of this great Man, he takes care to inform us that his Life draws to a Period, and as it were celebrates his Funeral before his Death.</P>
<P>Such Circum&s;tances as the&s;e greatly rai&s;e the Character of <HI>Achilles;</HI> he is &s;o truly valiant, that tho' he knows he mu&s;t fall before <HI>Troy,</HI> yet he does not ab&s;tain from the War, but couragiou&s;ly meets his Death: And here I think it proper to in&s;ert an Ob&s;ervation that ought to have been made be|fore, which is, that <HI>Achilles</HI> did not know that <HI>Hector</HI> was to fall by his Hand; if he had known it, where would have been the mighty Courage in engaging him in a &s;ingle Com|bat, in which he was &s;ure to conquer?

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 141. <HI>Nine Days are past &s;ince all the Court above,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> It may be thought that &s;o many Interpo&s;itions of the Gods, &s;uch Me&s;&s;ages from Heaven to Earth, and down to the Seas, are needle&s;s Machines; and it may be imagin'd that it is an Offence again&s;t Probability that &s;o many Deities &s;hould be employ'd to pacify <HI>Achilles:</HI> But I am of Opinion that the Poet conducts this whole Affair with admirable Judgment. The Poem is now almo&s;t at the Conclu&s;ion, and <HI>Achilles</HI> is to pa&s;s from a State of an almo&s;t inexorable Re&s;entment to a State of perfect Tranquillity; &s;uch a Change could not be brought about by human Means; <HI>Achilles</HI> is too &s;tubborn to obey any thing le&s;s than a God: This is evident from his reject|ing the Per&s;ua&s;ion of the whole <HI>Grecian</HI> Army to return to the Battle: So that it appears that this Machinery was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and con&s;equently a Beauty to the Poem.</P>
<P>It may be farther added, that the&s;e &s;everal Incidents pro|ceed from <HI>Jupiter:</HI> It is by his Appointment that &s;o many Gods are employ'd to attend <HI>Achilles.</HI> By the&s;e means <HI>Ju|piter</HI> fulfills the Promi&s;e mention'd in the fir&s;t Book, of ho|nouring the Son of <HI>Thetis,</HI> and the Poet excellently &s;u&s;tains his Character by repre&s;enting the inexorable <HI>Achilles</HI> as not parting with the Body of his mortal Enemy, but by the immediate Command of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>If the Poet had conducted the&s;e Incidents merely by human Means, or &s;uppos'd <HI>Achilles</HI> to re&s;tore the Body of <HI>Hector</HI> en|tirely out of Compa&s;&s;ion, the Draught had been unnatural, becau&s;e unlike <HI>Achilles:</HI> Such a Violence of Temper was not to be pacify'd by ordinary Methods. Be&s;ides, the Poet has

made u&s;e of the propere&s;t Per&s;onages to carry on the Affair; for who could be &s;uppos'd to have &s;o great an Influence upon <HI>Achilles</HI> as his own Mother, who is a Godde&s;s?</P>

The good Bi&s;hop is of Opinion, that they ought to be rejected, but the Rea&s;on he gives is as extraordinary as that of <HI>Thetis:</HI> Soldiers, &s;ays he, have more occa&s;ion for &s;omething to &s;trengthen them&s;elves with, than for Women: And this is the Rea&s;on, continues he, why Wre&s;tlers are forbid all Commerce with that Sex during the whole Time of their Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI> endeavours to ju&s;tify <HI>Homer</HI> by ob&s;erving, that this Advice of <HI>Thetis</HI> was not given him to induce him to any Wantonne&s;s, but was intended to indulge a nobler Pa&s;&s;ion, his De&s;ire of Glory: She advi&s;es him to go to that Captive who was re&s;tor'd to him in a pub|lick manner, to &s;atisfy his Honour: To that Captive, the Detention of whom had been &s;o great a Puni&s;hment to the whole <HI>Grecian</HI> Army: And therefore <HI>Thetis</HI> u&s;es a very pro|per Motive to comfort her Son, by advi&s;ing him to gratify at once both his Love and his Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="199">
<HI>Plutarch</HI> has likewi&s;e labour'd in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Ju&s;tification; he ob&s;erves that the Poet has &s;et the Picture of <HI>Achilles</HI> in this place in a very fair and &s;trong point of Light: Tho' <HI>Achilles</HI> had &s;o lately receiv'd his belov'd <HI>Bri&s;e&iuml;s</HI> from the Hands of <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> tho' he knew that his own Life drew to a &s;ud|den Period, yet the Hero prevails over the Lover, and he does not ha&s;te to indulge his Love: He does not lament <HI>Pa|troclus</HI> like a common Man by neglecting the Duties of Life, but he ab&s;tains from all Plea&s;ures by an Exce&s;s of Sorrow, and the Love of his Mi&s;tre&s;s is lo&s;t in that of his Friend.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation excellently ju&s;tifies <HI>Achilles,</HI> in not in|dulging him&s;elf with the Company of his Mi&s;tre&s;s: The Hero prevails &s;o much over the Lover, that <HI>Thetis</HI> thinks her &s;elf oblig'd to recall <HI>Bri&s;e&iuml;s</HI> to his Memory. Yet &s;till the Inde|cency remains. All that can be &s;aid in favour of <HI>Thetis</HI> is, that &s;he was Mother to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and con&s;equently might take the greater Freedom with her Son.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> di&s;approves of both the former Ob&s;ervati|ons: She has recour&s;e to the Lawfulne&s;s of &s;uch a Practice between <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;e&iuml;s;</HI> and becau&s;e &s;uch Commerces in tho&s;e times were reputed hone&s;t, therefore &s;he thinks the Ad|vice was decent: The married Ladies are oblig'd to her for this Ob&s;ervation, and I hope all tender Mothers, when their Sons are afflicted, will advi&s;e them to comfort them&s;elves in this manner.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I am of Opinion that this Pa&s;&s;age outrages De|cency; and 'tis a &s;ign of &s;ome Weakne&s;s to have &s;o much occa&s;ion of Ju&s;tification. Indeed the whole Pa&s;&s;age is capa|ble of a &s;erious Con&s;truction, and of &s;uch a Sen&s;e as a Mo|ther might expre&s;s to a Son with Decency: And then it will run thus; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why art thou, my Son, thus afflicted?

<P><PB N="208" REF="206">
But perhaps this whole Pa&s;&s;age may be better explain'd by having recour&s;e to the Pagan Theology: It was an Opinion that obtain'd in tho&s;e early Days, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> frequently &s;ent &s;ome friendly Me&s;&s;engers to protect the Innocent, &s;o that <HI>Homer</HI> might intend to give his Readers a Lecture of Mora|lity, by telling us that this unhappy King was under the Protection of the Gods.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> carries it farther. <HI>Homer</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) in&s;tructed by Tradition, knew that God &s;ends his Angels to the Succour of the afflicted.

Here is a great Conformity in the Ideas and in the Style; and the Example of our Author &s;o long before <HI>Tobit,</HI> proves, that this Opinion of God's &s;ending his Angels to the Aid of Man was very common, and much &s;pread a|mong&s;t the Pagans in tho&s;e former Times. <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>
