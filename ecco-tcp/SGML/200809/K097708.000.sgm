<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Declare I hardly know how to &s;ay what ju&s;tice to my&s;elf obliges me to &s;ay.&mdash;The public hears daily of &s;o many unlucky Poets, who become publi&s;hers from the &s;ame fate that ranges me in their cla&s;s, that I am apprehen&s;ive the truth, when told, will not &s;erve me as an apology, but the effect of con&s;traint be reputed the wi&s;h of pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of my &s;tudies fir&s;t gave me a ta&s;te for Poetry, and the &s;weetne&s;s of the art in&s;pired me with an inclination to improve it.&mdash;The few who &s;aw my ver&s;es
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
&s;aid they liked them, and would &s;ome|times a&s;k for a copy of what they had &s;een.&mdash;The fir&s;t plea&s;ure I know is to plea&s;e; and indeed I thought complying with their reque&s;ts an ea&s;y return for the obligation of their prai&s;e.&mdash;They had co|pies, and in their high opinion of me gave copies to others, who &s;oon circulated &s;ome of my pieces, as particular favours to particular friends, through half a do|zen editions, of which three or four were generally very incorrect.</P>
<P>To prevent this evil from &s;preading, I have here collected in one &s;mall book tho&s;e ver&s;es of which I have ever given
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
copies, as far as remembrance and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion have permitted me.</P>
<P>All parents have a partiality to their own child&mdash;&s;o every Writer has a par|tiality to the productions of his own brain, that would rather they were &s;een in a perfect than an imperfect &s;ituation&mdash; and when a man's writings must unavoid|ably be delivered into the hands of the public, a decent re&s;pect for his own cha|racter, and good manners to his fellow|creatures will oblige him to endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;iible, that they may not ex|cite a contempt for him&s;elf, nor be en|tirely u&s;ele&s;s and di&s;gu&s;ting to his readers.</P>
