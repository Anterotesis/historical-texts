<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A GREAT part of the Poetical Works of Mr. Shen|&s;tone, particularly his Elegies and Pa&s;torals, are (as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The exact tran&s;cripts of the &s;ituation of his own mind,"</Q> and abound in fre|quent allu&s;ions to his own place, the beautiful &s;cene of his retirement from the world. Exclu&s;ively, there|fore, of our natural curio&s;ity to be acquainted with the hi&s;tory of an author who&s;e Works we peru&s;e with plea|&s;ure, &s;ome &s;hort account of Mr. Shen&s;tone's per&s;onal character, and &s;ituation in life, may not only be agree|able, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to the reader, as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould enter into the true &s;pirit of his writings if he is entirely ignorant of tho&s;e circum|&s;tances of his life, which &s;ometimes &s;o greatly influen|ced his reflections.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h, however, that this ta&s;k had been al|lotted to &s;ome per&s;on capable of performing it in that ma&s;terly manner which the &s;ubject &s;o well de&s;erves. To confe&s;s the truth, it was chiefly to prevent his Re|mains from falling into the hands of any one &s;till le&s;s qualified to do him ju&s;tice, that I have unwillingly ventured to undertake the publication of them my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Shen&s;tone was the elde&s;t &s;on of a plain unedu|cated gentleman in Shrop&s;hire, who farmed his own e&s;tate. The father, &s;en&s;ible of his &s;on's extraordinary capacity, re&s;olved to give him a learned education,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
and &s;ent him a commoner to Pembroke College in Oxford, de&s;igning him for the church; but though he had the mo&s;t awful notions of the wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, of God, he never could be per&s;uaded to enter into orders. In his private opinions he adhered to no particular &s;ect, and hated all religious di&s;putes. But whatever were his own &s;entiments, he always &s;hewed great tenderne&s;s to tho&s;e who differed from him. Tenderne&s;s, indeed, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, was his peculiar characteri&s;tic; his friends, his do|me&s;tics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind. Indeed this virtue in him was often carried to &s;uch exce&s;s, that it &s;ome|times bordered upon weakne&s;s; yet if he was con|vinced that any of tho&s;e ranked among&s;t the number of his friends had treated him ungenerou&s;ly, he was not ea&s;ily reconciled. He u&s;ed a maxim, however, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, which is worthy of being ob&s;erved and imitated; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will be a re|vengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my nature, to be half a friend."</Q> He was in his temper quite un&s;u&s;picious, but if &s;u&s;picion was once awakened in him, it was not laid a&s;leep again without difficulty.</P>
<P>He was no economi&s;t; the genero&s;ity of his temper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the u&s;e of money: he exceeded, therefore, the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he died was con&s;i|derably incumbered. But when one recollects the perfect
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
paradi&s;e he had rai&s;ed around him, the ho&s;pita|lity with which he lived, his great indulgence to his &s;ervants, his charities to the indigent, and all done with an e&s;tate not more than three hundred pounds a-year, one &s;hould rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than to blame his want of economy. He left, however, more than &s;ufficient to pay all his debts, and by his will appropriated his whole e&s;tate for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It was perhaps from &s;ome con&s;iderations on the narrowne&s;s of his fortune that he forbore to marry, for he was no enemy to wedlock, had a high opinion of many among the fair &s;ex, was fond of their &s;ociety, and no &s;tranger to the tendere&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. One, which he received in his youth, was with difficulty &s;urmounted. The lady was the &s;ubject of that &s;weet pa&s;toral, in four parts, which has been &s;o univer&s;ally admired; and which, one would have thought, mu&s;t have &s;ubdued the loftie&s;t heart, and &s;oftened the mo&s;t obdurate.</P>
<P>His per&s;on, as to height, was above the middle &s;ta|ture, but largely and rather inelegantly formed: his face &s;eemed plain till you conver&s;ed with him, and then it grew very plea&s;ing. In his dre&s;s he was negli|gent even to a fault, though, when young, at the uni|ver&s;ity, he was accounted a beau. He wore his own hair, which was quite gray very early, in a particular manner; not from any affectation of &s;ingularity, but from a maxim he had laid down, that without too
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
&s;lavi&s;h a regard to fa&s;hion, every one &s;hould dre&s;s in a manner mo&s;t &s;uitable to his own per&s;on and figure. In &s;hort, his faults were only little blemi&s;hes, thrown in by Nature, as it were on purpo&s;e, to prevent him from ri&s;ing too much above that level of imperfection allotted to humanity.</P>
<P>His character, as a writer, will be di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;implicity with elegance, and genius with correctne&s;s. He had a &s;ublimity equal to the highe&s;t attempts; yet, from the indolence of his temper, he cho&s;e rather to amu&s;e him&s;elf in culling flowers at the foot of the mount, than to take the trouble of climbing the more arduous &s;teeps of Parna&s;&s;us: but whenever he was di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e, his &s;teps, though natural, were noble, and always well &s;upported. In the tenderne&s;s of Ele|giac poetry he hath not been excelled; in the &s;impli|city of Pa&s;toral, one may venture to &s;ay he had very few equals. Of great &s;en&s;ibility him&s;elf, he never failed to engage the hearts of his readers; and amid&s;t the nice&s;t attention to the harmony of his numbers, he always took care to expre&s;s, with propriety, the &s;en|timents of an elegant mind. In all his writings his greate&s;t difficulty was to plea&s;e him&s;elf. I remember a pa&s;&s;age in one of his Letters, where, &s;peaking of his Love Songs, he &s;ays,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Some were written on oc|ca&s;ions a good deal imaginary, others not &s;o; and the rea&s;on there are &s;o many is, that I wanted to write one good &s;ong, and could never plea&s;e my|&s;elf."</Q> It was this diffidence which occa&s;ioned him
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
to throw a&s;ide many of his pieces before he had be|&s;towed upon them his la&s;t touches. I have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;everal on this account; and if, among tho&s;e which I have &s;elected, there &s;hould be di&s;covered &s;ome little want of his fini&s;hing poli&s;h, I hope it will be attri|buted to this cau&s;e, and, of cour&s;e, be excu&s;ed: yet I flatter my&s;elf there will always appear &s;omething well worthy of having been pre&s;erved: and though I was afraid of in&s;erting what might injure the character of my friend, yet, as the &s;ketches of a great ma&s;ter are always valuable, I was unwilling the public &s;hould lo&s;e any thing material of &s;o accompli&s;hed a writer. In this dilemma it will ea&s;ily be conceived that the ta&s;k I had to perform would become &s;omewhat dif|ficult; how I have acquitted my&s;elf the public mu&s;t judge. Nothing, however, except what he had al|ready publi&s;hed, has been admitted without the advice of his mo&s;t judicious friends; nothing altered with|out their particular concurrence. It is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e every one; but 'tis hoped that no reader will be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to imagine that the Author wrote &s;olely for his amu&s;ement: his talents were various; and though it may perhaps be allowed that his ex|cellence chiefly appeared in &s;ubjects of tenderne&s;s and &s;implicity, yet he frequently conde&s;cended to trifle with tho&s;e of humour and drollery: the&s;e, indeed he him&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure degraded, by the title which he gave them of Levities; but had they been en|tirely rejected, the public would have been deprived
<PB N="x" REF="10">
of &s;ome <HI>jeux d'e&s;prits,</HI> excellent in their kind, and Mr. Shen&s;tone's character as a writer would have been but imperfectly exhibited.</P>
<P>But the talents of Mr. Shen&s;tone were not confined merely to poetry; his character, as a man of clear judgment and deep penetration, will be&s;t appear from his Pro&s;e Works; it is there we mu&s;t &s;earch for the acutene&s;s of his under&s;tanding, and his profound knowledge of the human heart. It is to be lamented, indeed, that &s;ome things here are unfini&s;hed, and can be regarded only as fragments: many are left as &s;ingle thoughts, but which, like the &s;parks of diamonds, &s;hew the richne&s;s of the mine to which they belong; or, like the foot of a Hercules, di&s;cover the uncom|mon &s;trength and extraordinary dimen&s;ions of that hero. I have no apprehen&s;ion of incurring blame from any one for pre&s;erving the&s;e valuable Remains; they will di&s;cover to every reader the Author's &s;entiments on &s;everal important &s;ubjects; and there can be very few to whom they will not impart many thoughts which they would never perhaps have been able to draw from the &s;ource of their own reflections.</P>
<P>But I believe little need be &s;aid to recommend the writings of this gentleman to public attention. His character is already &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed; and if he be not injured by the inability of his editor, there is no doubt but he will ever maintain an eminent &s;ta|tion among the be&s;t of our Engli&s;h writers.</P>

<HEAD>A PREFATORY ESSAY ON ELEGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that di&s;cour&s;es prefixed to poetry are contrived very frequently to inculcate &s;uch tenets as may exhibit the performance to the greate&s;t advan|tage: the fabric is very commonly rai&s;ed in the fir&s;t place, and the mea&s;ures by which we are to judge of its merit are afterwards adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>There have been few rules given us by the critics concerning the &s;tructure of Elegiac poetry; and far be it from the author of the following trifles to dignify his own opinions with that denomination: he would only intimate the great variety of &s;ubjects, and the different &s;tyles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This e&s;&s;ay was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> in which the writers of Elegy have hitherto indulged them&s;elves, and endeavour to &s;hield the following ones by the latitude of their example.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the etymology of the word<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&egr;-&lgr;&egr;&ggr;&egr;&igr;&ngr;, &egr;-particulam dolendi.</NOTE>, the epithet which Horace gives it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Mi&s;erabiles elegos.
<BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, or the confe&s;&s;ion which Ovid makes concerning it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Heu nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen erit.
<BIBL>Ovid. <HI>de Morte Tibulli.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>, I think we may conclude thus much however, that Elegy, in its true and genuine acceptation, includes a tender and que|rulous idea; that it looks upon this as its peculiar characteri&s;tic, and &s;o long as this is thoroughly &s;u|&s;tained, admits of a variety of &s;ubjects, which by its
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
manner of treating them it renders its own: it throws its melancholy&s;tole over pretty differentobjects, which, like the dre&s;&s;es at a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, gives them all a kind of &s;olemn and uniform appearance.</P>
<P>It is probable that Elegies were written, at fir&s;t, upon the death of intimate friends and near relations; celebrated beauties, or favourite mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: beneficent governors and illu&s;trious men: one may add, per|haps, of all tho&s;e who are placed by Virgil in the lau|rel grove of his Ely&s;ium, (<HI>Vide</HI> Hurd's Di&s;&s;ertation on Horace's Epi&s;tle)
<Q>Quique &s;ui memores alios &s;ecere merendo.</Q>
After the&s;e &s;ubjects were &s;ufficiently exhau&s;ted, and the &s;everity of fate di&s;played in the mo&s;t affecting in&s;tances, the poets &s;ought occa&s;ion to vary their com|plaints, and the next tender &s;pecies of &s;orrow that pre&s;ented it&s;elf was the grief of ab&s;ent or neglected lovers; and this indulgence might be indeed allowed them, but with this they were not contented: they had obtained a &s;mall corner in the province of love, and they took advantage from thence, to overrun the whole territory: they &s;ung its &s;poils, triumphs, ovations, and rejoicings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Dicite Io Paean, et Io bis dicite Paean.
<BIBL>Ovid.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, as well as the captivity and exequies that attended it: they gave the name of Elegy to their plea&s;antries as well as lamentations, till at la&s;t, through their abundant fondne&s;s for the myrtle, they forgot that the cypre&s;s was their peculiar garland.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="13">
In this it is probable they deviated from the origi|nal de&s;ign of Elegy, and it &s;hould &s;eem that any kind of &s;ubjects, treated in &s;uch a manner as to diffu&s;e a plea&s;ing melancholy, might far better de&s;erve the name than the facetious mirth and libertine fe&s;tivity of the &s;ucce&s;sful votaries of Love.</P>
<P>But, not to dwell too long upon an opinion which may &s;eem, perhaps, introduced to favour the follow|ing performance, it may not be improper to examine into the u&s;e and end of Elegy. The mo&s;t important end of all poetry is to encourage virtue. Epic and tragedy chiefly recommend the public virtues; Elegy is of a &s;pecies which illu&s;trates and endears the private. There is a truly virtuous plea&s;ure connected with many pen&s;ive contemplations, which it is the province and excellency of Elegy to enforce: this, by pre&s;enting &s;uitable ideas, has di&s;covered &s;weets in melancholy which we could not find in mirth, and has led us, with &s;ucce&s;s, to the du&s;ty urn, when we could draw no plea&s;ure from the &s;parkling bowl. As Pa&s;toral con|veys an idea of &s;implicity and innocence, it is in par|ticular the ta&s;k and merit of Elegy to &s;hew the inno|cence and &s;implicity of rural life to advantage; and that in a way di&s;tinct from Pa&s;toral, as much as the plain but judicious landlord may be imagined to &s;ur|pa&s;s his tenant both in dignity and under&s;tanding. It &s;hould al&s;o tend to elevate the more tranquil virtues of humility, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;implicity, and innocence:
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
but then there is a degree of elegance and re|finement no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e rural virtues, and that rai&s;es Elegy above that <HI>merum rus,</HI> that un|poli&s;hed ru&s;ticity, which has given our Pa&s;toral writers their highe&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>Wealth and &s;plendor will never want their proper weight; the danger is le&s;t they &s;hould too much pre|ponderate: a kind of poetry, therefore, which throws its chief influence into the other&s;cale, that magnifies the &s;weets of liberty and independence, that endears the hone&s;t delights of love and friend&s;hip, that celebrates the glory of a good name after death, that ridicules the futile arrogance of birth, that recommends the innocent amu&s;ement of letters, and in&s;en&s;ibly prepares the mind for that humanity it inculcates; &s;uch a kind of poetry may chance to plea&s;e, and if it plea&s;e, &s;hould &s;eem to be of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As to the &s;tyle of Elegy, it may be well enough determined from what has gone before: it &s;hould imi|tate the voice and language of grief, or, if a metaphor of dre&s;s be more agreeable, it &s;hould be &s;imple and dif|fu&s;e, and flowing as a mourner's veil. A ver&s;ification, therefore, is de&s;irable, which, by indulging a free and uncon&s;trained expre&s;&s;ion, may admit of that &s;implicity which Elegy requires.</P>
<P>Heroic metre, with alternate rhyme, &s;eems well e|nough adapted to this &s;pecies of poetry; and, however exceptionable upon other occa&s;ions, its inconveniencies
<PB N="xv" REF="15">
appear to lo&s;e their weight in &s;horter Elegies, and its advantages &s;eem to acquire an additional importance. The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a collection of Elegies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N.B.</HI> This preface was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> not long &s;ince publi&s;hed, the product of a gentleman of the mo&s;t exact ta&s;te, and who&s;e untimely death merits all the tears that Elegy can &s;hed.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;ome may think this metre too lax and pro&s;aic; others, that even a more di&s;&s;o|lute variety of numbers may have &s;uperior advan|tages: and in favour of the&s;e la&s;t might be produced the example of Milton in his Lycidas, together with one or two recent and beautiful imitations of his ver&s;i|fication in that monody. But this kind of argument, I am apt to think, mu&s;t prove too much, &s;ince the writers I have in view &s;eem capable enough of recom|mending any metre they &s;hall chu&s;e; though it mu&s;t be owned al&s;o, that the choice they make of any is at the &s;ame time the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption in its favour.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be no great difficulty to compro|mi&s;e the di&s;pute. There is no one kind of metre that is di&s;tingui&s;hed by rhymes but is liable to &s;ome objec|tion or other. Heroic ver&s;e, where every &s;econd line is terminated by a rhyme, (with which the judgment requires that the &s;en&s;e &s;hould in &s;ome mea&s;ure al&s;o terminate) is apt to render the expre&s;&s;ion either &s;canty or con&s;trained; and this is &s;ometimes ob&s;er|vable
<PB N="xvi" REF="16">
in the writings of a poet lately decea&s;ed, though I believe no one ever threw &s;o much &s;en&s;e together, with &s;o much ea&s;e, into a couplet, as Mr Pope: but as an air of con&s;traint too often accompanies this metre, it &s;eems by no means proper for a writer of Elegy.</P>
<P>The previous rhyme in Milton's Lycidas is very frequently placed at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the follow|ing, that it is often dropt by the memory (much better employed in attending to the &s;entiment) be|fore it be brought to join its partner; and this &s;eems to be the greate&s;t objection to that kind of ver&s;ifica|tion: but then the peculiar ea&s;e and variety it admits of are, no doubt, &s;ufficient to overbalance the objec|tion, and to give it the preference to any other, in an Elegy of length.</P>
<P>The chief exception, to which &s;tanza of all kinds is liable, is, that it breaks the &s;en&s;e too regularly when it is continued through a long poem; and this may be, perhaps, the fault of Mr. Waller's excellent panegyric. But if this fault be le&s;s di&s;cernible in &s;maller compo&s;itions, as I &s;uppo&s;e it is, I flatter my|&s;elf that the advantages I have before mentioned, re|&s;ulting from alternate rhyme, (with which &s;tanza is, I think, connected) may at lea&s;t, in &s;horter Elegies, be allowed to outweigh its imperfections.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay but little of the different kinds of Elegy. The melancholy of a lover is different, no doubt, from what we feel on other mixed occa&s;ions. The mind in
<PB N="xvii" REF="17">
which love and grief at once predominate is &s;oftened to an exce&s;s. Love-elegy, therefore, is more negli|gent of order and de&s;ign, and, being addre&s;&s;ed chiefly to the ladies, requires little more than tenderne&s;s and per&s;picuity. Elegies that are formed upon promi&s;cu|ous incidents, and addre&s;&s;ed to the world in general, inculcate &s;ome &s;ort of moral, and admit a different degree of rea&s;oning, thought, and order.</P>
<P>The Author of the following Elegies entered on his &s;ubjects occa&s;ionally, as particular incidents in life &s;ugge&s;ted, or di&s;po&s;itions of mind recommended them to his choice. If he de&s;cribes a rural land&s;cape, or unfolds the train of &s;entiments it in&s;pired, he fairly drew his picture from the &s;pot, and felt very &s;en|&s;ibly the affection he communicates: if he &s;peaks of his humble &s;hed, his flocks and his fleeces, he does not counterfeit the &s;cene, who having (whether thro' choice or nece&s;&s;ity is not material) retired betimes to country &s;olitudes, and &s;ought his happine&s;s in rural employments, has a right to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a real &s;hepherd. The flocks, the meadows, and the grottos, are his own, and the embelli&s;hment of his farm his &s;ole amu&s;ement. As the &s;entiments, therefore, were in&s;pired by Nature, and that in the earlier part of his life, he hopes they will retain a natural appearance, diffu&s;ing at lea&s;t &s;ome part of that amu&s;ement which, he freely acknowledges, he received from the compo|&s;ition of them.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="18">
There will appear, perhaps, a real incon&s;i&s;tency in the moral tenour of the &s;everal Elegies, and the &s;ub|&s;equent ones may &s;ometimes &s;eem a recantation of the preceding. The reader will &s;carcely impute this to over&s;ight, but will allow that men's opinions, as well as tempers, vary; that neither public nor pri|vate, active nor &s;peculative, life, are unexceptionably happy, and, con&s;equently, that any change of opinion concerning them may afford an additional beauty to poetry, as it gives us a more &s;triking repre&s;entation of life.</P>
<P>If the Author has hazarded, throughout, the u&s;e of Engli&s;h or modern allu&s;ions, he hopes it will not be imputed to an entire ignorance, or to the lea&s;t di&s;|e&s;teem of the ancient learning. He has kept the an|cient plan and method in his eye, though he builds his edifice with the materials of his own nation. In other words, through a fondne&s;s for his native coun|try, he has made u&s;e of the flowers it produced, tho', in order to exhibit them to the greater advantage, he has endeavoured to weave his garland by the be&s;t mo|del he could find; with what &s;ucce&s;s, beyond his own amu&s;ement, mu&s;t be left to judges le&s;s partial to him than either his acquaintance or his friends.&mdash;If any of tho&s;e &s;hould be &s;o candid as to approve the varie|ty of &s;ubjects he has cho&s;en, and the tenderne&s;s of &s;entiment he has endeavoured to impre&s;s, he begs the metre al&s;o may not be too &s;uddenly condemned. The
<PB N="xix" REF="19">
public ear, habituated of late to a quicker mea&s;ure, may perhaps con&s;ider this as heavy and languid; but an objection of that kind may gradually lo&s;e its force, if this mea&s;ure &s;hould be allowed to &s;uit the nature of Elegy.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould happen to be con&s;idered as an objection, with others, that there is too much of a moral ca&s;t di&s;&s;u&s;ed through the whole, it is replied, that he en|deavoured to animate the poetry &s;o far as not to ren|der this objection too obvious, or to ri&s;k excluding the fa&s;hionable reader; at the &s;ame time never devia|ting from a fixed principle, that poetry without mora|lity is but the blo&s;&s;om of a fruit-tree. Poetry is, in|deed, like that &s;pecies of plants which may bear at once both fruits and blo&s;&s;oms, and the tree is by no means in perfection without the former, however it may be embelli&s;hed by the flowers which &s;urround it.</P>

<BYLINE>BY R. DODSLEY.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Lea&s;owes is &s;ituate in the pari&s;h of Hales Owen, a &s;mall market-town in the county of Salop, but &s;ur|rounded by other counties, and thirty miles from Shrew&s;bury, as it is near ten to the borders of Shrop|&s;hire. Though a paternal e&s;tate, it was never di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for any peculiar beauties till the time of its late owner. It was re&s;erved for a per&s;on of his in|genuity both to di&s;cover and improve them, which he has done &s;o effectually, that it is now con&s;idered as among&s;t the principal of tho&s;e delightful &s;cenes which per&s;ons of ta&s;te, in the pre&s;ent age, are de&s;i|rous to &s;ee. Far from violating its natural beauties, Mr. Shen&s;tone's only &s;tudy was to give them their full effect; and although the form in which things now
<PB N="xxii" REF="22">
appear be indeed the con&s;equence of much thought and labour, yet the hand of Art is no way vi&s;ible ei|ther in the &s;hape of ground, the di&s;po&s;ition of trees, or (which are here &s;o numerous and &s;triking) the ro|mantic fall of his ca&s;cades.</P>
<P>But I will now proceed to a more particular de|&s;cription. About half a mile &s;hort of Hales Owen, in your way from Birmingham to Bewdley, you quit the great road, and turn into a green lane on the left hand, where, de&s;cending in a winding manner to the bottom of a deep valley finely &s;haded, the fir&s;t ob|ject that occurs is a kind of ruinated wall, and a &s;mall gate, within an arch, in&s;cribed, <Q REND="inline">"The Priory Gate."</Q> Here, it &s;eems, the company &s;hould proper|ly begin their walk, but generally chu&s;e to go up with their hor&s;es or equipage to the hou&s;e, from whence returning, they de&s;cend back into the val|ley. Pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;mall gate at the bottom of the fine &s;welling lawn that &s;urrounds the hou&s;e, you enter upon a winding path, with a piece of water on your right. The path and water, over&s;hadowed with trees that grow upon the &s;lopes of this narrow dingle, render the &s;cene at once cool, gloomy, &s;olemn, and &s;eque&s;tered, and form &s;o &s;triking a contra&s;t to the lively &s;cene you have ju&s;t left, that you &s;eem all on a &s;udden landed in a &s;ubterraneous kind of region. Winding forward down the valley, you pa&s;s be&s;ide a &s;mall root-hou&s;e, where, on a tablet, are the&s;e lines:<Q><PB N="xxiil" REF="23"><LG>
<L>" Here in cool grot and mo&s;&s;y cell,</L>
<L>" We rural Fays and Faeries dwell;</L>
<L>" Tho' rarely &s;een by mortal eye,</L>
<L>" When the pale moon, a&s;cending high,</L>
<L>" Darts thro' yon' limes her quiv'ring beams,</L>
<L>" We fri&s;k it near the&s;e cry&s;tal &s;treams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Her beams, reflected from the wave,</L>
<L>" Afford the light our revels crave;</L>
<L>" The turf, with dai&s;ies broider'd o'er,</L>
<L>" Exceeds, we wot, the Parian floor;</L>
<L>" Nor yet for artful &s;trains we call,</L>
<L>" But li&s;ten to the water's fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Would you then ta&s;te our tranquil &s;cene,</L>
<L>" Be &s;ure your bo&s;oms be &s;erene,</L>
<L>" Devoid of hate, devoid of &s;trife,</L>
<L>" Devoid of all that poi&s;ons life;</L>
<L>" And much it 'vails you in their place</L>
<L>" To graft the love of human race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" And tread with awe the&s;e favour'd bowers,</L>
<L>" Nor wound the &s;hrubs nor brui&s;e the flowers;</L>
<L>" So may your path with &s;weets abound,</L>
<L>" So may your couch with re&s;t be crown'd!</L>
<L>" But harm betide the wayward &s;wain</L>
<L>" Who dares our hallow'd haunts profane!"</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments corre&s;pond as well as po&s;&s;ible with the ideas we form of the abode of Fairies, and, appearing deep in this romantic valley, &s;erve to keep alive &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic images while this &s;ort of &s;cene continues.</P>
<P>You now pa&s;s through The Priory Gate before mentioned, and are admitted into a part of the val|ley &s;omewhat different from the former, tall trees, high irregular ground, and rugged &s;cars. The right pre&s;ents you with, perhaps, the mo&s;t natural, if not the mo&s;t &s;triking, of the many ca&s;cades here found;
<PB N="xxiv" REF="24">
the left with a &s;loping grove of oaks; and the centre with a pretty circular land&s;cape appearing through the trees, of which Hales Owen &s;teeple, and other objects at a di&s;tance, form an intere&s;ting part. The &s;eat beneath the ruinated wall has the&s;e lines of Vir|gil in&s;cribed, &s;uiting well with the general tenour of Mr. Shen&s;tone's late &s;ituation:<Q><L>&mdash; " Lucis habitamus opacis,</L>
<L>" Riparumque toros et prata recentia rivis</L>
<L>" Incolimus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>&mdash;We dwell in &s;hady groves,</L>
<L>And &s;eek the groves with cooling &s;treams refre&s;h'd,</L>
<L>And trace the verdant banks.</L></Q></P></NOTE>"</L></Q></P>
<P>You now proceed a few paces down the valley to another bench, where you have this ca&s;cade in front, which, together with the internal arch and other appendages, make a pretty irregular picture. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, once for all, that a number of the&s;e protem|pore benches (two &s;tumps with a tran&s;ver&s;e board) &s;eem chiefly intended as hints to &s;pectators, le&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing cur&s;orily through the farm they might &s;uffer any of that immen&s;e variety the place furni&s;hes to e&s;cape their notice. The &s;tream attending us, with its agreeable murmurs, as we de&s;cend along this plea&s;ing valley, we come next to a &s;mall &s;eat, where we have a &s;loping grove upon the right, and on the left a &s;triking vi&s;ta to the &s;teeple of Hales Owen,
<PB N="xxv" REF="25">
which is here &s;een in a new light. We now de&s;cend farther down this &s;hady and &s;eque&s;tered valley, ac|companied on the right by the &s;ame brawling rivulet running over pebbles, till it empties it&s;elf into a fine piece of water at the bottom. The path here wind|ing to the left conforms to the water before men|tioned, running round the foot of a &s;mall hill, and accompanying this &s;emicircular lake into another winding valley, &s;omewhat more open, and not le&s;s plea&s;ing, than the former: however, before we enter this, it will be proper to mention a &s;eat about the centre of this water-&s;cene, where the ends of it are lo&s;t in the two vallies on each &s;ide, and in front it is invi&s;ibly connected with another piece of water, of about twenty acres, open to Mr. Shen&s;tone, but not his property. This la&s;t was a performance of the monks, and part of a prodigious chain of fi&s;h-ponds that belonged to Hales Abbey. The back ground of this &s;cene is very beautiful, and exhibits a picture of villages and varied ground finely held up to the eye.</P>
<P>I &s;peak of all this as already fini&s;hed, but through &s;ome misfortune in the mound that pounds up the water it is not completed.</P>
<P>We now leave The Priory upon the left, which is not meant for an object here, and wind along into the other valley: and here I cannot but take notice of the judgment which formed this piece of water; for although it be not very large, yet, as it is formed
<PB N="xxvi" REF="26">
by the concurrence of three vallies, in which two of the ends are hid, and in the third it &s;eems to join with the large extent of water below, it is, to all ap|pearance, unbounded. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never &s;aw a more natural bed for water, or any kind of lake that plea&s;ed me better; but it may be right to mention, that this water, in its full extent, has a yet more im|portant effect from Mr. Shen&s;tone's hou&s;e, where it is &s;een to a great advantage. We now, by a plea&s;ing &s;erpentine walk, enter a narrow glade in the valley, the &s;lopes on each &s;ide finely covered with oaks and beeches, on the left of which is a common bench, which affords a retiring place &s;ecluded from every eye, and a &s;hort re&s;pite, during which the eye repo&s;es on a fine amphitheatre of wood and thicket.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a &s;eat beneath a prodigiou&s;ly fine canopy of &s;preading oak, on the back of which is this in&s;cription:
<Q><L>" Huc ades, O Meliboee! caper tibi &s;alvus et hoedi;</L>
<L>" Et &s;i quid cessare potes, requie&s;ce &s;ub umbra<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>Hither, O Meliboeus! bend thy way;</L>
<L>Thy herds, thy goats, &s;ecure from harm, repo&s;e;</L>
<L>If happy lei&s;ure &s;erve a while to &s;tay,</L>
<L>Here re&s;t thy limbs beneath the&s;e &s;hady boughs.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q>
The picture before it is that of a beautiful home|&s;cene; a &s;mall lawn of well-varied ground, encom|pa&s;&s;ed with hills and well-grown oaks, and embel|li&s;hed with a ca&s;t of the piping Faunus, amid trees
<PB N="xxvii" REF="27">
and &s;hrubs on a &s;lope upon the left, and on the right, and nearer the eye, with an urn thus in&s;cribed:
<Q>" Ingenio et amicitiae <LB>" Gvlielmi Somerville."</Q>
And on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide,
<Q>" G. S. po&s;vit, <LB>" Debita &s;pargens lacrima favillam <LB>" Vatis amici<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>TRANSLATION. <Q>To the genius and friend&s;hip <LB>of <LB>WILLIAM SOMERVILLE, <LB>By W. S. <L>Sprinkling the a&s;hes of a friendly bard</L><L>With tributary tears.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</Q> The &s;cene is inclo&s;ed on all &s;ides by trees; in the middle only there is an opening, where the lawn is continued, and winds out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Here entering a gate, you are led through a thic|ket of many &s;orts of willows, into a large root-hou&s;e, in&s;cribed to the Right Honourable the Earl of Stam|ford. It &s;eems that worthy peer was pre&s;ent at the fir&s;t opening of the ca&s;cade, which is the principal object from the root-hou&s;e, where the eye is pre&s;ent|ed with a fairy vi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of an irregular and romantic fall of water, very unu&s;ual, one hundred and fifty yards in continuity; and a very &s;triking &s;cene it affords. Other ca&s;cades may po&s;&s;ibly have the advantage of a greater de&s;cent and a larger tor|rent; but a more wild and romantic appearance of water, and at the &s;ame time &s;trictly natural, is what
<PB N="xxviii" REF="28">
I never &s;aw in any place whatever. This &s;cene, tho' comparatively &s;mall, is yet aggrandized with &s;o much art, that we forget the quantity of water which flows through this clo&s;e and over&s;haded valley, and are &s;o much tran&s;ported with the intricacy of &s;cene, and the concealed height from whence it flows, that we, without reflection, add the idea of magnificence to that of beauty. In &s;hort, it is not but upon reflec|tion that we find the &s;tream is not a Niagara, but rather a water-fall in miniature; and that the &s;ame artifice, upon a larger &s;cale, were there large trees in&s;tead of &s;mall ones, and a river in&s;tead of a rill, would be capable of forming a &s;cene that would ex|ceed the utmo&s;t of our ideas. But I will not dwell longer upon this inimitable &s;cene; tho&s;e who would admire it properly mu&s;t view it, as &s;urely as tho&s;e that view it mu&s;t admire it beyond almo&s;t any thing they ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>Proceeding on the right-hand path, the next &s;eat affords a &s;cene of what Mr. Shen&s;tone u&s;ed to call his Fore&s;t ground, con&s;i&s;ting of wild green &s;lopes peeping through dingle, or irregular groupes of trees, a con|fu&s;ed mixture of &s;avage and cultivated ground, held up to the eye, and forming a land&s;cape fit for the pencil of Salvator Ro&s;a.</P>
<P>Winding on be&s;ide this lawn, which is over-arch|ed with &s;preading trees, the eye catches, at intervals, over an intermediate hill, the &s;pire of Hales church,
<PB N="xxix" REF="29">
forming here a perfect obeli&s;k&mdash;the urn to Mr. So|merville, &amp;c.; and now pa&s;&s;ing through a kind of thicket, we arrive at a natural bower of almo&s;t cir|cular oaks, in&s;cribed in the manner following:<Q><L>" To Mr. DODSLEY.</L>
<L>" Come then, my Friend! thy &s;ylvan ta&s;te di&s;play;</L>
<L>" Come hear thy Faunus tune his ru&s;tic lay:</L>
<L>" Ah! rather come, and in the&s;e dells di&s;own</L>
<L>" The care of other &s;trains, and tune thine own."</L></Q></P>
<P>On the bank above it, amid the fore-mentioned &s;hrubs, is a &s;tatue of the piping Faun, which not on|ly embelli&s;hes this &s;cene, but is al&s;o &s;een from the court before the hou&s;e, and from other places: it is &s;urrounded by venerable oaks, and very happily &s;i|tuated. From this bower al&s;o you look down upon the fore-mentioned irregular ground, &s;hut up with trees on all &s;ides, except &s;ome few openings to the more plea&s;ing parts of this grote&s;que and hilly coun|try. The next little bench affords the fir&s;t, but not mo&s;t &s;triking, view of The Priory. It is indeed a &s;mall building, but &s;een as it is beneath trees, and its extre|mity al&s;o hid by the &s;ame, it has in &s;ome &s;ort the dig|nity and &s;olemn appearance of a larger edifice.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through a gate, we enter a &s;mall open grove, where the fir&s;t &s;eat we find affords a picture&s;que view, through trees, of a clump of oaks at a di&s;tance, over|&s;hadowing a little cottage upon a green hill: we thence immediately enter a perfect dome or circular temple of magnificent beeches, in the centre of which it was
<PB N="xxx" REF="30">
intended to place an antique altar, or a &s;tatue of Pan. The path &s;erpentizing through this open grove, leads us by an ea&s;y a&s;cent to a &s;mall bench with this motto,<Q><L>&mdash; " Me gelidum nemus</L>
<L>" Nympharumque leves cum &s;atyris chori</L>

<L>Conceal me from the world!</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L><BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q> which alludes to the retired &s;ituation of the grove. There is al&s;o &s;een, through an opening to the left, a plea&s;ing land&s;cape of a di&s;tant hill, with a whited farm-hou&s;e upon the &s;ummit; and to the right hand a beautiful round &s;lope, crowned with a clump of large firs, with a pyramidal &s;eat on its centre, to which, after no long walk, the path conduct us.</P>
<P>But we fir&s;t come to another view of The Priory, more advantageous, and at a better di&s;tance, to which the eye is led down a green &s;lope, through a &s;cenery of tall oaks, in a mo&s;t agreeable manner, the grove we have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed on one &s;ide, and a hill of trees and thicket on the other, conducting the eye to a narrow opening through which it appears.</P>
<P>We now a&s;cend to a &s;mall bench, where the cir|cumjacent country begins to open; in particular a gla&s;s-hou&s;e appears between two large clumps of trees, at about the di&s;tance of four miles; the gla&s;s-hou&s;es in this country not ill re&s;embling a di&s;tant pyramid.
<PB N="xxxi" REF="31">
A&s;cending to the next &s;eat, which is in the Gothic form, the &s;cene grows more and more extended; woods and lawns, hills and vallies, thicket and plain, agreeably intermingled. On the back of this &s;eat is the following in&s;cription, which the Author told me that he cho&s;e to fix here, to &s;upply what he thought &s;ome want of life in this part of the farm, and to keep up the &s;pectator's attention till he came to &s;cale the hill beyond.</P>

<P>And now, pa&s;&s;ing through a wicket, the path winds up the back part of a circular green hill, di&s;covering little of the country till you enter a clump of &s;tately firs upon the &s;ummit. Over-arched by the&s;e firs is an octagonal &s;eat, the back of which is &s;o contrived as to form a table or pede&s;tal for a bowl or goblet, thus in&s;cribed&mdash;
<Q>" To all friends round The Wrekin!"</Q>
This facetious in&s;cription, being an old Shrop&s;hire health, is a commemoration of his country friends,
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="33">
from which this part of Shrop&s;hire is divided: add to this that The Wrekin, that large and venerable hill, appears full in front, at the di&s;tance of about thirty miles.</P>
<P>The &s;cene is a very fine one, divided by the firs in|to &s;everal compartments, each an&s;wering to the octa|gonal &s;eat in the centre; to each of which is allotted a competent number of &s;triking objects to make a complete picture. A long &s;erpentine &s;tream wa&s;hes the foot of this hill, and is lo&s;t behind trees at one end, and a bridge thrown over at the other. Over this the eye is carried from very romantic home|&s;cenes to very beautiful ones at a di&s;tance. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to give an idea of that immen&s;e variety, that fine configuration of parts, which engage our atten|tion from this place. In one of the compartments you have a &s;imple &s;cene of a cottage, and a road winding behind a farm-hou&s;e half covered with trees, upon the top of &s;ome wild &s;loping ground; and in an|other a view of the town, appearing from hence as upon the &s;helving banks of a large piece of water in the flat. Suffice it to &s;ay, that the hill and vale, plain and woodland, villages and &s;ingle hou&s;es, blue di&s;tant mountains that &s;kirt the horizon, and green hills ro|mantically jumbled, that form the intermediate ground, make this &s;pot more than commonly &s;tri|king&mdash;nor is there to be &s;een an acre of level ground through the large extent to which the eye is carried.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="34">
Hence the path winds on betwixt two &s;mall benches, each of which exhibits a plea&s;ing land&s;cape, which can|not e&s;cape the eye of a connoi&s;&s;eur.</P>
<P>Here we wind through a &s;mall thicket, and &s;oon enter a cavity in the hill, filled with trees, in the centre of which is a &s;eat, from whence is di&s;covered, gleaming acro&s;s the trees, a con&s;iderable length of the &s;erpentine &s;tream before mentioned, running un|der a &s;light ru&s;tic bridge to the right: hence we a&s;cend in a kind of Gothic alcove, looking down a &s;lope, &s;ided with large oaks and tall beeches, which toge|ther over-arch the &s;cene. On the back of this build|ing is found the following</P>
<P>INSCRIPTION.<Q><LG>
<L>" O you that bathe in courtlye bly&s;&s;e,</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>Below this alcove is a large &s;loping lawn, finely bounded, cro&s;&s;ed by the &s;erpentine water before mentioned,
<PB N="xxxv" REF="35">
and inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ingle, or clumps of oaks at agreeable di&s;tances. Further on the &s;cene is finely varied, the hills ri&s;ing and falling towards the oppo&s;ite concavities, by the &s;ide of a long winding vale, with the mo&s;t graceful confu&s;ion. A|mong other &s;cenes that form this land&s;cape, a fine hanging wood, backed and contra&s;ted with a wild heath, inter&s;ected with cro&s;s roads, is a very con&s;i|derable object. Near adjoining to this is a &s;eat, from whence the water is &s;een to advantage in many dif|ferent &s;tages of its progre&s;s; or where (as a poetical friend once ob&s;erved) the proprietor has taken the Naiad by the hand, and led her an irregular dance into the valley.</P>
<P>Proceeding hence through a wicket, we enter up|on another lawn, beyond which is a new theatre of wild &s;haggy precipices, hanging coppice ground, and &s;mooth round hills between, being not only differ|ent, but even of an oppo&s;ite character, to the ground from which we pa&s;&s;ed. Walking along the head of this lawn, we come to a &s;eat under a &s;preading beech, with this</P>
<P>INSCRIPTION.<Q><L>" Hoc erat in votis: modus agri non ita magnus,</L>

<P><PB N="xxxvi" REF="36">
In the centre of the hanging lawn before you is di&s;covered the hou&s;e, half hid with trees and bu&s;hes: a little hanging wood, and a piece of winding wa|ter, i&s;&s;ues through a noble clump of large oaks and &s;preading beeches. At the di&s;tance of about ten or twelve miles Lord Stamford's grounds appear, and beyond the&s;e the Clee hills in Shrop&s;hire. The &s;cene here con&s;i&s;ts of admirably-varied ground, and is, I think, a very fine one. Hence pa&s;&s;ing &s;till along the top of the lawn, we cro&s;s another gate, and behind the fence being to de&s;cend into the valley. About half way down is a &s;mall bench, which throws the eye upon a near &s;cene of hanging woods and &s;haggy wild declivities, intermixed with &s;mooth green &s;lopes and &s;cenes of cultivation.</P>
<P>We now return again into the great lawn at bot|tom, and &s;oon come to a &s;eat, which gives a nearer view of the water before mentioned, between the trunks of high over&s;hadowing oaks and beeches, be|yond which the winding line of trees is continued down the valley to the right. To the left, at a di|&s;tance, the top of Clent hill appears, and the hou&s;e upon a &s;well, amid&s;t trees and bu&s;hes. In the centre, the eye is carried by a &s;ideling view down a length of <PB N="xxxvii" REF="37">
lawn, till it re&s;ts upon the town and &s;pire of Hales, with &s;ome picture&s;que and beautiful ground ri&s;ing behind it.</P>
<P>Somewhat out of the path, and in the centre of a noble clump of &s;tately beeches, is a &s;eat in&s;cribed to Mr. Spence, in the&s;e words:<Q>IOSEPHO SPENCE, <LB>eximio no&s;tro Critoni; <LB>cvi dicari vellet <LB>Mv&s;arvm omnivm et Gratiarvm chorvs, <LB>dicat amicitia. <LB>1758<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>Dedicated by friend&s;hip <LB>to JOSEPH SPENCE, <LB>our mo&s;t excellent Crito, <LB>whom <LB>the unanimous con&s;ent <LB>of every Mu&s;e and Grace <LB>made choice of <LB>to be &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>We now, through a &s;mall gate, enter what is called The Lover's Walk, and proceed immediately to a &s;eat where the water is &s;een very advantageou&s;ly at full length; which, though not large, is &s;o agreeably &s;hap|ed, and has its bounds &s;o well concealed, that the beholder may receive le&s;s plea&s;ure from many lakes of greater extent. The margin on one &s;ide is fringed with alders, the other is overhung with mo&s;t &s;tately oaks and beeches, and the middle beyond the wa|ter pre&s;ents the Hales Owen &s;cene, with a group of hou&s;es on the &s;lope behind, and the horizon well
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="38">
fringed with the wood. Now winding a few paces round the margin of the water, we come to another &s;mall bench, which pre&s;ents the former &s;cene &s;ome|what varied, with the addition of a whited village a|mong trees upon a hill. Proceeding on, we enter the plea&s;ing gloom of this agreeable walk, and come to a bench beneath a &s;preading beech that overhangs both walk and water, which has been called The A&s;&s;igna|tion Seat, and has this in&s;cription on the back of it:<Q><L>" Nerine Galatea! thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae,</L>

This very &s;oft and pen&s;ive &s;cene, very properly &s;tyled The Lover's Walk, is terminated with an ornamented urn, in&s;cribed to Mi&s;s Dolman, a beautiful and ami|able relation of Mr. Shen&s;tone's, who died of the &s;mall-pox, about twenty-one years of age, in the fol|lowing words on one &s;ide:<Q><PB N="xxxix" REF="39">

<P><Q>How much inferior <LB>is the living conver&s;ation <LB>of others <LB>to the bare remembrance <LB>of thee!</Q></P></NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P>The a&s;cent from hence winds &s;omewhat more &s;teep|ly to another &s;eat, where the eye is thrown over a rough &s;cene of broken and furzy ground, upon a piece of water in the flat, who&s;e extremities are hid behind trees and &s;hrubs, among&s;t which the hou&s;e appears, and makes upon the whole no unplea&s;ing picture. The path &s;till winds under cover up the hill, the &s;teep declivity of which is &s;omewhat ea&s;ed by the &s;erpen|tine &s;weep of it, till we come to a &s;mall bench, with this line from Pope's Eloi&s;a:<Q><PB N="xl" REF="40">
<L>" Divine oblivion of low-thoughted Care!"</L></Q> The opening before it pre&s;ents a &s;olitary &s;cene of trees, thickets, and precipice, and terminates upon a green hill, with a clump of firs on the top of it.</P>
<P>We now find the great u&s;e as well as beauty of the &s;erpentine path in climbing up this wood, the fir&s;t &s;eat of which, alluding to the rural &s;cene before it, has the following lines from Virgil:<Q><L>&mdash; " Hic latis otia fundis</L>

<L>And peaceful &s;leep beneath embow'ring trees,</L>
<L>While lowing herds &s;urround.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q> Here the eye looking down a &s;lope beneath the &s;pread|ing arms of oak and beech trees, pa&s;&s;es fir&s;t over &s;ome rough furzy ground, then over water to the large &s;welling lawn, in the centre of which the hou&s;e is di&s;|covered among trees and thickets: this forms the fore ground. Beyond this appears a &s;well of wa&s;te furzy land, diver&s;ified with a cottage, and a road that winds behind a farm-hou&s;e and a fine clump of trees. The back &s;cene of all is a &s;emicircular range of hills, diver&s;ified with woods, &s;cenes of cultivation, and in|clo&s;ures, to about four or five miles' di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Still winding up into the wood, we come to a &s;light &s;eat, opening through the trees to a bridge of five
<PB N="xli" REF="41">
piers, cro&s;&s;ing a large piece of water at about half a mile's di&s;tance. The next &s;eat looks down from a con&s;iderable height, along the &s;ide of a &s;teep preci|pice, upon irregular and plea&s;ing ground. And now we turn upon a &s;udden into a long &s;traight-lined walk in the wood, arched over with tall trees, and termi|nating with a &s;mall ru&s;tic building. Though the walk, as I &s;aid, be &s;traight-lined, yet the ba&s;e ri&s;es and falls &s;o agreeably, as leaves no room to cen&s;ure its forma|lity. About the middle of this avenue, which runs the whole length of this hanging wood, we arrive unexpectedly at a lofty Gothic &s;eat, whence we look down a &s;lope, more con&s;iderable than that before mentioned, through the wood on each &s;ide. This view is indeed a fine one, the eye fir&s;t travelling down over well-variegated ground into the valley, where is a large piece of water, who&s;e &s;loping banks give all the appearance of a noble river. The ground from hence ri&s;es gradually to the top of Clent hill, at three or four miles' di&s;tance, and the land&s;cape is enriched with a view of Hales Owen, the late Lord Dudley's hou&s;e, and a large wood of Lord Lyttleton's. It is impo&s;&s;ible to give an adequate de&s;cription of this view, the beauty of it depending upon the great va|riety of objects and beautiful &s;hape of ground, and all at &s;uch a di&s;tance as to admit of being &s;een di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>Hence we proceed to the ru&s;tic building before mentioned, a &s;light and unexpen&s;ive edifice, formed
<PB N="xlii" REF="42">
of rough unhewn &s;tone, commonly called here The Temple of Pan, having a trophy of the Tibia and Syrinx, and this in&s;cription over the entrance:
<Q><L>" Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures</L>

<L>Pan from impending harm the fold defends,</L>
<L>And Pan the ma&s;ter of the fold befriends.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q>
Hence mounting once more to the right, through this dark umbrageous walk, we enter at once upon a light&s;ome high natural terrace, whence the eye is thrown over all the &s;cenes we have &s;een before, to|gether with many fine additional ones, and all be|held from a declivity that approaches as near a pre|cipice as is agreeable. In the middle is a &s;eat with this in&s;cription:
<Q>Divini gloria rvris<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION.<Q>

O glory of the &s;ylvan &s;cene divine!</Q></P></NOTE>!</Q>
To give a better idea of this, by far the mo&s;t magni|ficent &s;cene here, it were, perhaps, be&s;t to divide it into two di&s;tinct parts&mdash;the noble concave in the front, and the rich valley towards the right.&mdash;In re|gard to the former, if a boon companion could en|large his idea of a punch-bowl, ornamented within with all the romantic &s;cenery the Chine&s;e ever yet devi&s;ed, it would, perhaps, afford him the highe&s;t idea he could po&s;&s;ibly conceive of earthly happine&s;s:
<PB N="xliii" REF="43">
he would certainly wi&s;h to &s;wim in it. Suffice it to &s;ay, that the horizon, or brim, is as finely varied as the cavity. It would be idle here to mention the Clee hills, the Wrekin, the Wel&s;h mountains, or Caer Ca|radoc, at a prodigious di&s;tance; which, though they fini&s;h the &s;cene agreeably, &s;hould not be mentioned at the Lea&s;owes, the beauty of which turns chiefly upon di&s;tingui&s;hable &s;cenes. The valley upon the right is equally enriched, and the oppo&s;ite &s;ide thereof well fringed with woods, and the high hills on one &s;ide this long winding vale rolling agreeably into the hol|lows on the other. But the&s;e are a kind of objects which, though really noble in the &s;urvey, will not &s;trike a reader in de&s;cription as they would a &s;pecta|tor upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Hence returning back into the wood, and cro&s;&s;ing Pan's Temple, we go directly down the &s;lope into another part of Mr. Shen&s;tone's grounds, the path leading down through very plea&s;ing home-&s;cenes of well-&s;haped ground, exhibiting a mo&s;t perfect concave and convex, till we come at a &s;eat under a noble beech, pre&s;enting a rich variety of fore-ground, and at, perhaps, half a mile's di&s;tance, the Gothic alcove on a hill well covered with wood, a pretty cottage un|der trees in the more di&s;tant part of the concave, and a farm-hou&s;e upon the right, all picture&s;que objects.</P>
<P>The next and the &s;ub&s;equent &s;eat afford pretty much the &s;ame &s;cenes a little enlarged, with the addition
<PB N="xliv" REF="44">
of that remarkable clump of trees called Frankly Beeches, adjoining to the old family-&s;eat of the Lyt|tletons, and from whence the pre&s;ent Lord Lyttle|ton derives his title.</P>
<P>We come now to a hand&s;ome Gothic &s;creen, backed with a clump of firs, which throws the eye in front full upon a ca&s;cade in the valley, i&s;&s;uing from beneath a dark &s;hade of poplars. The hou&s;e appears in the centre of a large &s;welling lawn, bu&s;hed with trees and thicket. The plea&s;ing variety of ea&s;y &s;wells and hol|lows, bounded by &s;cenes le&s;s &s;mooth and cultivated, affords the mo&s;t delightful picture of dome&s;tic retire|ment and tranquillity.</P>
<P>We now de&s;cend to a &s;eat inclo&s;ed with hand&s;ome pales, and backed with firs, in&s;cribed to Lord Lyt|tleton. It pre&s;ents a beautiful view up a valley con|tracted gradually, and ending in a group of mo&s;t magnificent oaks and beeches. The right-hand &s;ide is enlivened with two &s;triking ca&s;cades, and a wind|ing &s;tream &s;een at intervals between tufts of trees and woodland. To the left appears the hanging wood already mentioned, with the Gothic &s;creen on the &s;lope in the centre.</P>
<P>Winding &s;till downwards, we come to a &s;mall &s;eat, where one of the offices of the hou&s;e, and a view of a cottage on very high ground, is &s;een over the tops of the trees of the grove in the adjacent valley, giving an agreeable in&s;tance of the abrupt inequality of
<PB N="xlv" REF="45">
ground in this romantic well-variegated country. The next &s;eat &s;hews another face of the &s;ame valley, the water gliding calmly along betwixt two &s;eeming groves without any ca&s;cade, as a contra&s;t to the former one, where it was broken by ca&s;cades: the &s;cene very &s;ig|nificantly alluded to by the motto,
<Q><L>" Rura mihi, et rigul placeant in vallibus amnes,</L>

<P>We de&s;cend now to a beautiful gloomy &s;cene, call|ed Virgil's Grove, where, on the entrance, we pa&s;s by a &s;mall obeli&s;k on the right hand, with this in|&s;cription:
<Q>P. Virgilio Maroni <LB>Lapis i&s;te cvm lvco &s;acer e&s;to<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>To <LB>P.

He derived the addition of Maro from his father, who was &s;o called.</NOTE>.</Q></P></NOTE></Q>
Before this is a &s;light bench, where &s;ome of the &s;ame objects are &s;een again, but in a different point of light. It is not very ea&s;y either to paint or de&s;cribe this delightful grove: however, as the former has been more than once attempted, I will hope to apologize for an imperfect de&s;cription, by the difficulty found
<PB N="xlvi" REF="46">
by tho&s;e who have aimed to &s;ketch it with their pen|cil. Be it, therefore, fir&s;t ob&s;erved, that the whole &s;cene is opaque and gloomy, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall deep valley or dingle, the &s;ides of which are inclo&s;ed with irregular tufts of hazel and other underwood, and the whole over&s;hadowed with lofty trees ri&s;ing out of the bottom of the dingle, through which a copious &s;tream makes its way through mo&s;&s;y banks, enamelled with primro&s;es, and variety of wild wood flowers. The fir&s;t &s;eat we approach is thus in&s;cribed:<Q>Celeberrimo Poetae <LB>IACOBO THOMSON, <LB>Prope fontes illi non fa&s;tiditos <LB>G. S. <LB>Sedem hanc ornavit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>To the much celebrated Poet JAMES THOMSON, This &s;eat was placed near his favourite &s;prings by W.

This &s;eat is placed upon a &s;teep bank on the edge of the valley, from which the eye is here drawn down
<PB N="xlvii" REF="47">
into the flat below, by the light that glimmers in front, and by the &s;ound of various ca&s;cades, by which the winding &s;tream is agreeably broken. Oppo&s;ite to this &s;eat the ground ri&s;es again in an ea&s;y concave to a kind of dripping fountain, where a &s;mall rill trickles down a rude nich of rock-work, through fern, liver|wort, and acquatic weeds, the green area in the mid|dle, through which the &s;tream winds, being as well &s;haped as can be imagined. After falling down the&s;e ca&s;cades, it winds under a bridge of one arch, and then empties it&s;elf into a &s;mall lake which catches it a little below. This terminates the &s;cene upon the right; and after the&s;e objects have for &s;ome time a|mu&s;ed the &s;pectator, his eye rambles to the left, where one of the mo&s;t beautiful ca&s;cades imaginable is &s;een, by way of incident, through a kind of vi&s;ta or glade, falling down a precipice overarched with trees, and &s;trikes us with &s;urpri&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the plea&s;ure which one feels on this occa&s;ion; for though &s;urpri&s;e alone is not excellence, it may &s;erve to quicken the effect of what is beautiful. I believe none ever beheld this grove without a thorough &s;en&s;e of &s;atisfaction; and were one to chu&s;e any particular &s;pot of this perfectly Arcadian farm, it &s;hould, per|haps, be this; although it &s;o well contra&s;ts both with the terrace and with &s;ome other &s;cenes, that one can|not wi&s;h them ever to be divided. We now proceed to a &s;eat at the bottom of a large root on the &s;ide of a &s;lope, with this in&s;cription:</P>

<L>' For&s;akes the &s;un's unwelcome gleam,</L>
<L>' To lurk within this humble &s;tream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' And &s;ure I hear the Naiad &s;ay,</L>
<L>" Flow, flow, my Stream! this devious way;</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>The view from it is a calm tranquil &s;cene of water, gliding through &s;loping ground, with a &s;ketch through the trees of the &s;mall pond below.</P>
<P>The &s;cene in this place is that of water &s;tealing a|long through a rude &s;eque&s;tered vale, the ground on each &s;ide covered with weeds and field flowers, as that before is kept clo&s;e &s;haven. Farther on we lo&s;e all &s;ight of water, and only hear the noi&s;e, without ha|ving the appearance; a kind of effect which the Chi|ne&s;e are fond of producing in what they call their Scenes of enchantment. We now turn, all on a &s;udden, upon the high ca&s;cade which we admired before in
<PB N="xlix" REF="49">
vi&s;ta. The &s;cene around is quite a grotto of native &s;tone running up it, roots of trees overhanging it, and the whole &s;haded over head. However, we fir&s;t ap|proach, upon the left, a chalybeat &s;pring, with an iron bowl chained to it, and this in&s;cription upon a &s;tone:

Then turning to the right, we find a &s;tone &s;eat, ma|king part of the afore&s;aid cave, with this well-applied in&s;cription:
<Q><L>Intus aqvae dulces, vivoqve &s;edilia &s;axo;</L>

which I have often heard Mr. Shen&s;tone term the definition of a grotto. We now wind up a &s;hady path on the left hand, and cro&s;&s;ing the head of this ca&s;|cade, pa&s;s be&s;ide the river that &s;upplies it in our way up to the hou&s;e. One &s;eat fir&s;t occurs under a &s;hady oak as we a&s;cend the hill; &s;oon after we enter the &s;hrubbery, which half &s;urrounds the hou&s;e, where we find two &s;eats, thus in&s;cribed to two of his mo&s;t par|ticular friends.
