<P>IN the gardens of the palace at Fulham is a dark rece&s;s; at the end of this &s;tands a chair which once belonged to bi&s;hop Bonner.&mdash;A certain bi&s;hop of London, more than 200 years after the death of the afore&s;aid Bonner, ju&s;t as the clock of the gothic chapel had &s;truck &s;ix, undertook to cut with his own hand a narrow walk thro' this thicket, which is &s;ince called the <HI>monk's walk.</HI> He had no &s;ooner begun to clear the way than, lo! &s;uddenly up-&s;tarted from the chair the gho&s;t of bi&s;hop Bonner, who in a tone of ju&s;t and bitter indignation uttered the following ver&s;es.</P>

<P>By the lap&s;e of time the three la&s;t &s;tanzas are become unintelligible. Old chronicles &s;ay, that towards the latter end of the 18th century a bill was brought into the Briti&s;h parliament by an active young reformer for the aboli|tion of a pretended traffic of the human &s;pecies. But this only &s;hews how little faith is to be given to the exaggerations of hi&s;tory, for as no ve&s;tige of this incredible trade now remains, we look upon the whole &s;tory to have been one of tho&s;e fictions, not uncommon among authors, to blacken the memory of former ages.</P>
