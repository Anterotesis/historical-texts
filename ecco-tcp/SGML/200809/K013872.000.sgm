<P>THE SPANISH LADY, A MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT, IN TWO ACTS; Founded on the PLAN of the OLD BALLAD.</P>
<P>As performed at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Will you hear of a SPANISH Lady,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Author of this little Piece having already thought it incumbent on him, to explain, in the public Paper, his Motives for writ|ing it, and the Rea&s;ons, why it did not make it's Ap|pearance on the Stage at that time, he pre&s;umes a Repetition of tho&s;e will be the mo&s;t proper Preface to it here.</P>
<P>The elegant Simplicity of the Old Ballad (which has been ju&s;tly remarked by many writers of allowed Ta&s;te) had often induced me to wi&s;h to &s;ee it modelled into a Petite-piece. The Advice of a &s;ingular Conque&s;t, ob|tained over Spain, in the Year 1762, influenced me to attempt it. I thought the Scene might, not im|probably, be laid there; and that &s;ome few Hints, tending to illu&s;trate, and (as far as &s;o &s;mall a Produc|tion might be able) to perpetuate that glorious Ex|ploit,
<PB REF="3">
would, while popular Prai&s;e and Admiration was alive and warm, attone for what Deficiences might be found in the Conduct and Diction, &s;uch a kind of Undertaking being really new to me.</P>
<P>With this View, the Piece was received, licen&s;ed, and rehear&s;ed at <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> the Winter before la&s;t&mdash;but the Di&s;turbances, which then happened at both Theatres, ob&s;tructed the intended Performance.</P>
<P>If now &s;tands as a &s;imple Fable, and may be con|&s;idered merely as the Story of the SPANISH LADY brought forward into View. If, in the principal Scene between the Engli&s;h Officer, and the Lady, I have not wholly de&s;troyed the pathetic Simplicity of my Original, I &s;hould hope, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mu&s;ic, (which has been &s;elected under the In&s;pection of an eminent Compo&s;er) that the Piece may not be found un-enter|taining to a delicate, and a feeling Mind. Wherever I could, I have u&s;ed the very Words of the Ballad, which, for the Satisfaction of a curious Eye, I have hereunto annexed.</P>
<P>In this plain Dre&s;s, my Production now appeals to the Candour of an Engli&s;h Audience,</P>
<P>And is,</P>

<P>I have, Sir,&mdash;The Children are all purely, except the Elde&s;t, who &s;eems chain'd to her Mother's Chair; 'Tis hard to &s;ay, which of the two has cry'd mo&s;t. When I gave her the Pur&s;e, &s;he wou'd have expre&s;s'd her thanks, but her Amazement, a while, prevented her. At la&s;t &s;he had ju&s;t &s;ighed out your Name, when I produced her poor dead Hu&s;band's Watch, which I di&s;cover'd, la&s;t Night, at George Ravage's; the very &s;ight of it threw her into &s;uch an A|gony, that I was oblig'd to leave it in her Lap, and run off.

<P>En&s;ign, your Servant! I like this young Fellow. The Readine&s;s and Satisfaction, with which he undertakes a good Action, are &s;ingularly agreeable.

<HEAD>OLD BALLAD&punc; OF THE SPANISH LADY.</HEAD>

<L>WILL you hear of a SPANISH Lady,</L>
<L>How &s;he woo'd an ENGLISH Man?</L>
<L>Garments gay and rich as may be,</L>
<L>Deck'd with Jewels, &s;he had on:</L>
<L>Of a comely Countenance,</L>
<L>And Grace was &s;he;</L>

<L>Of high Degree.</L>

<L>As his Pris'ner there he kept her,</L>
<L>In his Hands her Life did lie;</L>
<L>Cupid's Bands did tie them fa&s;ter,</L>
<L>By the Liking of an Eye.</L>
<L>In his courteous Company</L>
<L>Was all her Joy;</L>
<L>To favour him in any thing,</L>
<L>She was not coy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But at length there came Commandment,</L>
<L>For to &s;et all Ladies free,</L>
<L>With their Jewels &s;till adorned,</L>
<L>None to do them Injury.</L>
<L>Then &s;aid this Lady mild,</L>
