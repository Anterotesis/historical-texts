<HEAD>A Farther Continuation OF THE HISTORY OF THE Crown-Inn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN my la&s;t I told you what furi|ous Pretentions were made to Mr. WRIGHT's Favour, by a Set of Fellows, who, you will conclude little de&s;erve it; and if you con&s;ider that the greate&s;t part of that Letter was writ before His coming to Town; you will likewi&s;e agree, that I &s;poke &s;ome|what like a Prophet.</P>
<P>But indeed, what is ea&s;ier than to fore&s;ee Things which have &s;uch natural and una|voidable
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Con&s;equences; for nothing but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Impudence, as well as the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and vain Conceptions, could have given them the lea&s;t Pretence to it; or have urg'd them to hope what they were neither intituled to, or qualified for.</P>
<P>They were very officious in their Attend|ance on Mr. WRIGHT when he arrived near the Town, and as &s;uppliant as Spaniels in their Sycophantick <HI>Devoires.</HI> They feigned and wrung out an hundred Compliments which he took littlenotice of; But of all, you would have laught heartily at <HI>BOB,</HI> with his <HI>INVIO|LABLE ATTACH,</HI> and <HI>boa&s;ted Intere&s;t; BOB</HI> after all was fain to implore the Favour to be introduced; and when he had duck'd him&s;elf into a low and ob&s;equious Cringe, as he drew near, Mr. WRIGHT by a &s;udden Pre|&s;ence of Mind, turned his back upon him, and poor <HI>BOB</HI>'s Countenance fell like a <HI>Wea|ther-Gla&s;s</HI> at the Alteration of the Weather.</P>
<P>This admirable Farce wou'd have la&s;ted much longer, to the great Diver&s;ion of the Town; but that Mr. WRIGHT who is the mo&s;t free and unaffected Man living, and cannot endure any thing that looks like con|&s;traint, or &s;ervile Flattery, re&s;olved not to be pe&s;ter'd with 'em; and therefore by di&s;mi&s;|&s;ing <HI>Jacob Ru&s;h, Sim,</HI> and &s;ome other of the <HI>King leaders,</HI> de&s;igned to convince the re&s;t,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
what he thought of their Company; and that he was capable to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who had merited from him, from tho&s;e who had not.</P>
<P>You will hardly believe me, when I tell you, that the <HI>CURATE</HI> had the Impu|dence to appear publickly at the <HI>INN.</HI> Sure|ly the Front of that Fellow mu&s;t be of the mo&s;t &s;olid and obdurate Bra&s;s. Can it be for|got how often he has drank young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s Health; and preach'd up his Intere&s;t by Inu|mendo's, in direct oppo&s;ition to Mr. WRIGHT's Succe&s;&s;ion? Is any thing more notorious, un|le&s;s his own corrupt Life, than his encou|raging his Enemies, both in Life and Do|ctrine? How often has he been drunk at the <HI REND="blackletterType">Popes-Head,</HI> the <HI REND="blackletterType">Cro&s;s-Keys,</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">Mi|tre,</HI> with the Friends of young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute?</HI> For he promotes no Hou&s;e, that is not even in its very De&s;cription well affected to him. Was this a Wretch now to appear bare-faced to Mr. WRIGHT? or can any thing better di&s;|cribe the unaccountable Vanity of an unthink|ing termagant Party?</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of this was, that the Wretch was hu&s;tled out of the Hou&s;e, and had been buffeted, but out of deference to his <HI>Coat.</HI> Can you divine now, what &s;hould be in the Man's Head? His Friends indeed, ac|cording to their u&s;ual Vanity, &s;aid we &s;hou'd
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;ee him a B&mdash;p, but could even the mo&s;t &s;tupid <HI>Clodpate</HI> alive, really hope or be|lieve this, after he &s;aw his Confederates under the deplorable Circum&s;tances of <HI>Di&s;grace,</HI> and the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> entirely &s;unk that could &s;upport his unju&s;t Preten&s;ions? Well of all the Sence|le&s;s furious Creatures that breath in the open Regions of the Air, commend me to the <HI>CURATE</HI> and his Party, for &s;omething ve|ry ridiculous, and out of the common Road and Propriety of Thinking.</P>
<P>A Friend of mine gives a very good turn to this and &s;ays, it was a De&s;ign of the Party to &s;end him thither on purpo&s;e to be affronted, thereby to give a &s;econd handle to enflame the Mob, as at an Injury or Di&s;re&s;pect offered to the <HI>Church;</HI> and this to be &s;ounded by the <HI>Trum|pets of Zion</HI> among the People. I will grant for once they may be capable to Think, for there are &s;ome &s;hallow <HI>Trick&s;ters</HI> among them; and therefore my Friends Notion may be ju&s;t; but if ever they are hanged for <HI>Conjurers</HI> I'll be Shot, or throw my &s;elf out of the Win|dow, as an Au&s;picious <HI>Patron</HI> of his did, when he remembered the irreparable Injury he had done his Country, by <HI>Charioting</HI> and Countenancing &s;uch a pernicious <HI>Incendiary.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Party have now changed their Sentiments; it is at length beat|en into their fortified Skulls; that their
<PB N="7" REF="6">
mighty Pretences to Mr. WRIGHT's Favour were frivilous, and without Ground. They do not &s;o warmly, and proudly affirm now, <HI>That they were the Men who brought him in;</HI> and all the Love, and previous Grimaces, and the faint Acclamations before his Arrival, are turned into dull and in&s;ignificant <HI>Shruggs.</HI></P>
<P>The glorious <HI>Changes</HI> at the <HI>INN</HI> have almo&s;t work'd them into their Ancient Spi|rit: The Con&s;ternation is great, but they have always a Body of Re&s;erve ready to &s;u|&s;tain them under the mo&s;t &s;hocking and terri|ble Defeats. It is plea&s;ant to hear the&s;e Fel|lows, who but a few Days ago, were heard to utter the mo&s;t melodious Things imagina|ble of Mr. WRIGHT, now a&s;&s;ume a dogmati|cal Air of rea&s;oning upon his Conduct; and &s;training them&s;elves into ambiguous and ridi|culous Hints; as if his known and celebrated Virtue were any way in the Ca&s;e of di&s;|countenancing &s;uch a pack of deep Mouth'd <HI>Curs,</HI> that are always full Cry in running down <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Innocence;</HI> and where they have neither Courage nor Hone&s;ty to &s;peak: their Minds, are Villains enough to make di&s;tant and raskally Reflections. But let them take care, for we have a &s;ub&s;tantial pair of <HI>Stocks</HI> here, and a <HI>Whipping-Po&s;t</HI> of the fitte&s;t Magnitude, equal to the brawnie&s;t Back of the mo&s;t Sizeable Villain among them; be&s;ides two &s;turdy young <HI>Elms</HI> at the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Towns-end, that grew in a true Prote&s;tant Country where HEREDITARY RIGHT, SLAVERY, and ARBITRARY POWER were never heard off.</P>
<P>I am vexed that I mu&s;t trouble you with &s;uch Trifles as the&s;e, but I &s;hall never get through my Purpo&s;e without letting you into the&s;e little Details; nor wou'd you be &s;o ca|pable to reli&s;h Things more momentous, if you were not truely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the pre&s;ent State and litigious Spirit of the Party You remember what they were in Power, and 'tis proper you &s;hou'd know what they are in <HI>Ad|ver&s;ity,</HI></P>
<P>They forget the old Proverb, <HI>That Sawce for the Goo&s;e is Sawce for the Gander.</HI> What havock they made in turning out the <HI>Old Ser|vants,</HI> upon the mo&s;t frivolous Pretences, and what a Scrabling they made to get their Fin|gers into the <HI>Widow's Di&s;h.</HI> Never was &s;uch a Set of <HI>Cormorants</HI> known, they devoured by whole&s;ale, yet went on with eager Com|plaints again&s;t the <HI>Old Servants,</HI> the better to conceal their own voracious Stomachs: One was accu&s;ed of taking <HI>Half Penny Rolls</HI> out of the <HI>Bakers</HI> Basket, another for Embezling the <HI>Hay and Oats,</HI> and a third for receiving <HI>Rec|konings</HI> and not bringing the Money to the <HI>Bar:</HI> But for Truth, they left that to be made out by <HI>Jonathan Wormwood</HI> their <HI>Ama|nuen&s;is</HI> a very <HI>bitter</HI> Fellow again&s;t all the <HI>old Servants,</HI> a witty facetious Varlet, and a
<PB N="9" REF="8">
and hanger on to <HI>Bob,</HI> who kept him for &s;uch Purpo&s;es, for which he was excellently qua|lified, for he was as wicked as his Heart could wi&s;h; and had the be&s;t Talent at <HI>Railery</HI> and <HI>Lies</HI> a Man could po&s;&s;ibly be endued-withal.</P>
<P>How he handled the <HI>Widow's Friends</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> you have heard already; it was however equal to the Ju&s;tice and Candour of all their other Proceedings, and helpt to fur|ni&s;h half the Blockheads in Town of that Party with Matter to hold an Argument. Some drew the whole <HI>Rigmaro</HI> into a kind of u&s;eful Common Place, for the greater Ea&s;e to their Memory's; and every <HI>Jackdaw</HI> or <HI>Owl</HI> in Town could hoot out &s;ome &s;encele&s;s Le&s;&s;on taken from his Scurrilous Memoirs.</P>
<P><HI>Bob</HI> had half a Dozen of the&s;e Fellows at his Beck, who hated him heartily, but for the Bread they receiv'd out of the <HI>Widow's Basket.</HI> Every Raskal had his &s;eparate In&s;tructions. To one it was given to blacken the <HI>Widow's</HI> Friends, and &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity of coming to an Agreement without them; to another, to render our own Condition de&s;perate, the better to frighten People into a Sence of it; a third was to run down the Credit of the Old Servants, and cry up the great Hone&s;ty of the new; a fourth, to di&s;cant on the <HI>Church;</HI> a fifth on <HI>Trade;</HI> and a &s;ixth ince&s;&s;antly to cry out <HI>Faction, Plots, wicked De&s;igns,</HI> &amp;c. and keep the Town in continual Alarm, to
<PB N="10" REF="9">
prevent their cooling, or recovering their pro|per Sences.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Tools,</HI> as infamous as they were, an|&s;wer'd the Ends they were employed on: the Mob e&s;pecially, and the mo&s;t unthinking and injudicious People, were taken by the Ears, and li&s;tened to them with great Attention, and by &s;uch Mountebank Methods, the Cre|dit of their Proceedings at the <HI>Inn</HI> was wholly &s;upported.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widow,</HI> poor Woman, they kept up in her Chamber, and per&s;uaded her, that her appearing below Stairs might be prejudi|cial to her Health, and that every thing went on well, and her <HI>Cu&s;tomers</HI> appeared all very much plea&s;ed with their Entertainment: So that &s;he &s;eldome came into the <HI>Bar,</HI> unle&s;s now and then on a <HI>Market-day</HI> or &s;o, or at a CLUB-SUPPER, when it was nece&s;&s;a|ry for her to pa&s;s &s;ome <HI>Accounts.</HI> The Rogues had indeed &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;ay, &s;he was mi&s;led and abu&s;ed by the Old Servants, if they judged from the re&s;ult of their own Conduct, for they found &s;he was a perfect ea&s;ie Woman; and if her <HI>Tenants</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;tomers</HI> were but plea&s;ed with their U&s;age, &s;he &s;eldome en|quired further, and they took &s;pecial Care that none of the Old Servants might come near her, and &s;tifled all Letters by the Po&s;t when they &s;u&s;pected the Hand Writing, for
<PB N="11" REF="10">
fear &s;he &s;hou'd get any Intelligence of the true State of the <HI>Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>They were taking all other Methods they could think on to make the Game &s;ure, when they differed among them&s;elves about the Means, and to the great Satisfaction of the Town, fell together by the Ears, <HI>Nab,</HI> like an ungrateful Slut as &s;he was, had not that regard to the Advancement <HI>Bob</HI> had been a Means to promote her to; and perhaps there was &s;omething in it more than ordinary: <HI>Bob</HI> was on the decline, aged Fifty-five, and up|wards; of a temperate and phlegmatick Con|&s;titution. <HI>Harry</HI> was in the meridian of his Days; a robu&s;t young Dog, full of Life and Fire, with a vigorous Shape, &s;trong Back, and hale Complexion, fed high, and had an amorous Soul of his own. The Rogue has good Blood in his Veins too, but no more the Son of old <HI>HARRY</HI> than I am of <HI>Ju|piter.</HI> The old Man di&s;owns his Proceedings, and &s;ays, he always feared he would come to &s;ome violent End, from his turbulent di&s;obe|dient Spirit. That his Mother, re&s;t her Soul, dreamt of a <HI>Comet</HI> the Night &s;he was deli|vered of him, and could never govern him as he &s;hou'd be. Nay, you mu&s;t know the young Knave took up a Belt again&s;t his own Father once at a WRESTLING, and threw him out of the <HI>Ring.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
But to proceed. <HI>Harry,</HI> by the&s;e &s;trong Per&s;ua&s;ions, drew <HI>Nab</HI> into his Party: Not that &s;he has many <HI>Babies</HI> to be &s;een in her Eyes, for they have for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, di&s;|played but a very dull Water, yet the Jade had a feeling Conception of the foregoing Qualifications, and there was an excellent Character &s;tirring of his &s;ingular Talent that Way. <HI>Nab Eve&s;dropt</HI> dropp'd all that pa&s;s'd between the <HI>VVidow</HI> and <HI>Bob,</HI> and gave <HI>Harry</HI> an Account &s;till; and took all Opportunities to improve Things to his Advantage, for I &s;hould have told you, that <HI>Nab,</HI> according to <HI>Bob</HI>'s Prediction, was by this Time become a Lady; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, valued her&s;elf not a little upon it: She looked as much above her former <HI>Occupation,</HI> as an <HI>Up&s;tart 'Squire</HI> does above a <HI>Hack,</HI> when he has dipt the ANTIENT SEAT, for a Gilt Chariot, and a Pair of <HI>Swi&s;&s; Tails. Nab</HI> was <HI>Hand and Glove</HI> with the <HI>VVidow,</HI> and not a Pin could be &s;tuck right, if it was not of <HI>Nab</HI>'s do|ing; for <HI>Nab</HI> had been well brought up, and could handle her Needle, tiff up a Fall below, or do any other Work, as well as Drudgery; tho' the BEESOM was indeed the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely adapted to her Hands of any other Perqui&s;ite of her Office. <HI>Nab</HI> kept the <HI>VVidow's Pur&s;e,</HI> and bought <HI>Perfumes, Pow|der,</HI> and <HI>Patches,</HI> &amp;c. and made many a round Penny of her Markettings: She had
<PB N="13" REF="12">
a Liquori&s;h Tooth of her own, and loved a Cordial at her Heart, which &s;he always po&s;ted in her Bill of Incidents: They &s;ay 'twas pretty large at the <HI>VVidow's</HI> Death.</P>
<P>There were other of the Female Servants at the INN violently attached to <HI>Harry</HI>'s Per&s;on, through the Impre&s;&s;ion of his &s;mug Countenance, and brawny Shoulders: No <HI>Page</HI> cou'd &s;wallow <HI>Quince-Marmalet</HI> more greedily, than the&s;e <HI>Simpering Baggages</HI> did the Complimental Addre&s;&s;es of the young <HI>Brazier;</HI> every one believing, like <HI>Don John</HI>'s &s;ix Wives, <HI>That &s;he was the VVoman!</HI> and each putting her&s;elf forward, with the great|e&s;t Addre&s;s to &s;erve him, and render him gra|cious in the Eyes of the <HI>VVidow:</HI> This it is to have the Reputation of being what we call <HI>a VVoman's Man: Bob,</HI> with all his Politick Airs, and Set Faces, could not conjure him|&s;elf into the Womens Graces, and <HI>Harry</HI> had a favourable Gift beyond all the Magick of his <HI>VVand. Harry</HI> wou'd Dance with them on the Green, play at <HI>Drop-Glove, Stool-Ball,</HI> and the like; which <HI>Bob</HI> was too fee|ble and &s;tiff in the Hams for; and could only figh that he had introduced &s;uch a Smock-faced young <HI>VVhore&s;bird</HI> to Supplant him.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Thus you &s;ee by what Mea&s;ures <HI>Harry</HI> carried his Point, and engag'd the <HI>Private Ser|vices</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Female Advocates,</HI> who&s;e &s;hort Triumph, and &s;udden Fall, is now the Subject of their Tears and Concern. Realy, the Fellow might be very happy, could he but lay a&s;ide Ambition, and confine him&s;elf to a rural kind of Life. The great Re&s;ort of Females his Reputation wou'd &s;oon draw a|bout him, could not but afford a very happy Pro&s;pect of Plea&s;ure to one, who is by Na|ture fitlier qualified for the lacivious Drudge|ry of a <HI>Seraglio,</HI> than the Gravity of Pub|lick Bu&s;ine&s;s. In &s;hort, <HI>Harry</HI>'s a very pret|ty Fellow, and a boon Companion; but the Rogue was &s;o near &s;acrificing his Country; he's never to be tru&s;ted at the INN more, if he comes off no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget, that I promi&s;ed you an Account of the pre&s;ent State thereof. I con|cluded with telling you of the &s;everal <HI>Changes</HI> made at the INN, and what was likely to en&s;ue. <HI>Charles,</HI> the <HI>Head-O&s;tler,</HI> and <HI>Ned Top&s;ail,</HI> as I hinted, are both re|&s;tored to their Places: Hone&s;t <HI>VVill Truby</HI> has jo&s;tled that queer Fellow <HI>Jack Squeami&s;h,</HI> out of his STEWARDSHIP; and <HI>Frank Stirrup,</HI> Son of old <HI>Ralph</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;h|keeper,</HI> has received the Keys of the COF|FER
<PB N="15" REF="14">
again, from the reluctant Hands of <HI>Nab</HI>'s enabled <HI>Con&s;ort.</HI></P>
<P>Every thing looks with a good A&s;pect, and the Hou&s;e begins to appear in its ancient Gran|deur: You may remember in what a Plight you left us; Solitary and Di&s;con&s;olate; our Credit &s;unk; our Trade cramp'd and ruin'd; the <HI>Country</HI> Beggard; and the INN in the Hands of a Set of Arbritrary Fellows that drove on <HI>Jehu-</HI>like to our De&s;truction; our Friends affronted and di&s;couraged; Hone&s;t Men put out of all, and none but a parcel of indefea&s;ible Raskals preferr'd, who de|&s;erved hanging for their known Zeal to young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute:</HI> But you will now find us with &s;miling Countenances, chearful Spirits, and compo&s;ed Minds. We could hardly &s;peak before for fear of our <HI>Taskma&s;ters;</HI> but we dare now No&s;e tho&s;e Villains that u&s;ed to gibe us. Men of Integrity are only looked on at the INN, and to have been well at|tached to the New LANDLORD, is the be&s;t Argument for pre&s;ent Merit.</P>
<P><HI>Robin Bold,</HI> the Plummer, <HI>Dick File-du&s;t,</HI> the Smith, <HI>Nick Silver-Tongue,</HI> the Lapida|ry, and the re&s;t of the hone&s;t Lads that &s;tood titely for him at the la&s;t WRESTLING, are brought into Play again, and are ready to take up a <HI>Cudgel</HI> on the <HI>&s;ame &s;ide</HI> whenever Occa&s;ion offers. They threaten us hard in &s;ome Parts
<PB N="16" REF="15">
of the <HI>Country,</HI> but we have as good as carried the <HI>Belt</HI> in this <HI>Town</HI> already almo&s;t two to one; and we doubt not but to &s;hew 'em fair Play for it every where el&s;e: We have a Par|cel of mettled Lads that have been u&s;ed to Sport, and are not afraid of a broken Head or two, if it comes to the Pu&s;h.</P>
<P>You may remember, I always told you <HI>Things</HI> could not la&s;t long as they went on; and 'tis confirmed what I told you in my Fir&s;t, that the <HI>VVidow</HI> de&s;igned to have made great Alterations at the <HI>INN,</HI> had &s;he recovered. 'Tis likewi&s;e as certain, that they broke her Heart among them, by di&s;covering one ano|thers Rogueries, when they fell out. Poor Wo|man! they had harra&s;s'd her &s;o for 3 Years to|gether, and made her break her Words often with her hone&s;t <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Tenants,</HI> that when &s;he came once to reflect, it ca&s;t her into &s;uch a deep Melancholy, as carried her precipitately to the Grave. In her la&s;t Intervals, &s;he enter|ed into the following <HI>Soliloquy,</HI> to this Effect, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Unhappy Woman! have I for this &s;o long eat the Bread of Carefulne&s;s? Took Pains early and late to promote a Trade, and gain Reputation to the INN, on purpo&s;e to make all thy <HI>Tenants</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;to|mers</HI> ea&s;ie and happy? And is all my Trou|ble and Care come to this at la&s;t? It was not &s;o, &s;ays &s;he, in the Days of my old Servants: My Affairs went well then;
<PB N="17" REF="16">
and nothing I undertook but was Succe&s;s|ful. I had a Reputation far and near, and was e&s;teemed and courted even by my very Adver&s;aries: My Tenants and Cu&s;tomers were perpetually Rejoicing; but I fear I have now given them too great an Occa|&s;ion for Sorrow. Could I recal a little Time, <HI>But I &s;hall ne'er outlive it;</HI> I wou'd endeavour to remove the Cau&s;e, and make them all ea&s;ie again. But this is re&s;erved for Heaven and my Succe&s;&s;or: Tell my poor <HI>People</HI> I dye theirs; and yet I am &s;or|ry I cannot do more to redre&s;s them before I depart.</Q> This &s;aid, &s;he turned about, and with a Sigh breathed out her Soul to him that gave it.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e Fellows capable of Correction, &s;ure this would have &s;ome effect on them: But I de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing them &s;hew the lea&s;t Signs of Grace and Repentance.</P>
<P>You have heard how they wou'd have in&s;i|nuated them&s;elves into Mr. WRIGHT'S Favour, and what a fawning and cringing they u&s;ed at fir&s;t, but when they &s;aw he was not to be cajoled, and made a very ju&s;t Di&s;tinction of their Proceedings toward him, by clearing the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of them; they pre&s;ently changed their Notes, and are forming a Cabal again&s;t his Conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
The rewarding the long and eminent Ser|vices of hone&s;t <HI>John Tru&s;ty,</HI> is one of the greate&s;t <HI>Cuts</HI> to 'em of all; for tho' they bear the re&s;t with Spleen and Impatience enough, yet there is in this a double Portion of Acri|mony. <HI>John</HI> was the Honour and Support of the old <HI>Servants,</HI> and the Terror and Di&s;grace of the <HI>New: John</HI> caried the CAUSE a|gain&s;t Old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI> for many Years toge|ther, to the great Di&s;advantage of their Idol Young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute. John</HI> refu&s;ed to Countenance their Schemes in making the Compo&s;ition, and rather cho&s;e to retire out of the Country, than breath the &s;ame Air with &s;uch Villains as &s;eemed to have abandoned all Faith and Honour, and were driving at the Ruin of their Country. And if that Raskal <HI>Slyboots</HI> had no|thing el&s;e to an&s;wer but the Per&s;ecution and ill Treatment of this worthy Man, that were enough never to have him forgiven.</P>
<P>How ea&s;ie it is to gue&s;s the Rage and Fer|ment the&s;e Fellows are in at Mr. WRIGHT's glorious Proceedings. They &s;ay, <HI>he begins too &s;oon, moves too fa&s;t, and that this can|not la&s;t long,</HI> with other &s;uch rediculous Stuff: But the&s;e are rather their Wi&s;hes than their Sentiments; both which are as much below his Re&s;entment, as the &s;encele&s;s Reflection of the Party. He came here to govern, and cho&s;e rather to &s;hew them, that he &s;aw no
