<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THIS night with dread unu&s;ual we appear,</L>
<L>(For this has been a very damning year)</L>
<L>E&s;tabli&s;h'd fame perhaps in vain we bring,</L>
<L>Since rigid ju&s;tice is an awful thing,</L>
<L>Awful and hateful, human but in part,<MILESTONE N="5"></L>
<L>All frown, an out&s;ide man, without a heart.</L>
<L>Such you may &s;ee in every &s;treet you pa&s;s,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as like men, in plai&s;ter, &s;tone, or bra&s;s.</L>
<L>Our early Prologues in le&s;s cautious times,</L>
<L>Rail'd at the audience in permitted rhymes,<MILESTONE N="10"></L>
<L>Faults there might be, they own'd, but then wou'd &s;wear,</L>
<L>Of faults or beauties, you no judges were.</L>
<L>As peers, by brother peers alone are tried,</L>
<L>Poets alone, on poets &s;hou'd decide.</L>
<L>With &s;urly Ben this dogma fir&s;t began,<MILESTONE N="15"></L>
<L>So in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to pert Colley ran.</L>
<L>John Dryden, with a crab &s;tick of har&s;h wit,</L>
<L>Rejoiced to drub the Hydra of the pit.</L>
<L>Tho' little then was right, and much ami&s;s,</L>
<L>Not one of all the venom'd tongues dur&s;t hi&s;s.<MILESTONE N="20"></L>
<L><PB REF="3">On the tamed &s;pirit of the cudgel'd town,</L>
<L>Almanzor and mad Maximin went down.</L>
<L>Now, by inver&s;ion ten times more polite,</L>
<L>The poet's always wrong, the critic right.</L>
<L>Nay, &s;ome have found a more enlighten'd way,<MILESTONE N="25"></L>
<L>And boldly cen&s;ure who ne'er &s;aw the play.</L>
<L>This mayn't perhaps be ju&s;tice to the letter,</L>
<L>To &s;ee is well, but in&s;piration's better.</L>
<L>Of old, the vehicles of wit were &s;carce,</L>
<L>Men judged upon the &s;pot of play or farce.<MILESTONE N="30"></L>
<L>By no concocted &s;pite the piece was torn,</L>
<L>The &s;hort lived Virus died where it was born.</L>
<L>No daily column then was gladly &s;een,</L>
<L>By envy rai&s;ed, and &s;cribled o'er by &s;pleen.</L>
<L>And &s;ure if pleas'd or griev'd, we little gain,<MILESTONE N="35"></L>
<L>By rea&s;oning back the plea&s;ure or the pain.</L>
<L>Still &s;afely we may tru&s;t the feeling part,</L>
<L>But never &s;et the head again&s;t the heart.</L>
<L>For various cau&s;es you frequent the &s;cene,</L>

<L>A pa&s;&s;ive mi&s;tre&s;s many here pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>But mo&s;t we &s;ee have nothing el&s;e to do.</L>
<L>Others prefer, the days dull bu&s;ine&s;s done,<MILESTONE N="45"></L>
<L>To yawn in company than quite alone.</L>
<L><PB REF="4">Good harmle&s;s &s;ouls! may no rude &s;ounds mole&s;t 'em</L>
<L>Nor pa&s;&s;ions, feign'd or real e'er infe&s;t 'em!</L>
<L>In times not long gone by, a noble peer,</L>
<L>(Unlike the &s;prightly race who now trip here)<MILESTONE N="50"></L>
<L>Four previous footmen his high &s;tate expre&s;s,</L>
<L>And gorgeous as a &s;atrap was his dre&s;s.</L>
<L>No hou&s;ehold fowl on maple perch repos'd,</L>
<L>As innocent of thought, more &s;weetly dozed.</L>
<L>Warm in his muff, with periwig for cap,<MILESTONE N="55"></L>
<L>Here he indulged one di&s;continuous nap.</L>
<L>Yates, Woodward, Cibber, Garrick charm'd in vain,</L>
<L>Kind Morpheus held him in his &s;ofter chain.</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as the curtain drop'd, he heard it &s;aid,</L>
<L>A well known &s;lentor of the &s;tage was dead.<MILESTONE N="60"></L>
<L>"I'm glad on't (cries my lord) and why do you think?</L>
<L>"He roar'd &s;o loud, I cou'd not &s;leep one wink."</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>SUCH is the force of cu&s;tom's powerful &s;way</L>
<L>An Epilogue mu&s;t fini&s;h every play,</L>
<L>But when, or where, or why the mode began,</L>
<L>Tell it &s;ome &s;tage-read &s;cholar, if he can.</L>
<L>I know enough for me, that 'tis the fa&s;hion,</L>
<L>Which governs this, and every other nation.</L>
<L>And yet to try with &s;ome poor paltry je&s;t</L>
<L>To cha&s;e all tragic feelings from the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Appears to my weak judgment, let me own,</L>
<L>Like filling of the pail, to kick it down.<MILESTONE N="10"></L>
<L>Nor le&s;s ab&s;urd than if &s;ome beauteous queen</L>
<L>With mantle flowing and maje&s;tic mein,</L>
<L>More admiration of her charms to gain</L>
<L>Shou'd chu&s;e a Monkey to bear up her train.</L>
<L>Pray tell would Handel's oratorio's plea&s;e</L>
<L>If clos'd with <HI>Bobbin Joan,</HI> or <HI>Butter'd Peas?</HI></L>
<L>Yet &s;ince the tyrant cu&s;tom bids us try,</L>
<L>To make you laugh, whom we before made cry,</L>
<L>I wi&s;h with all my heart our Proteus poet</L>
<L>Had rhym'd me &s;omething merry that would do it.<MILESTONE N="20"></L>
<L><PB REF="92">No matter what, of homely Gills, or Jacks,</L>
<L>Or Beaux with &s;pider legs, and lizard backs.</L>
<L>How the bold &s;pirit of the modern dame</L>
<L>Throned in her car, drives the high road to fame,</L>
<L>While more delight the labour can afford,</L>
<L>To rule four cour&s;ers, than obey one lord.</L>
<L>Behold, incumbent o'er her ponies backs,</L>
<L>The &s;ounding la&s;h our female Jehu &s;macks,</L>
<L>Thro' her &s;mall fingers plys her &s;kilful reins,</L>
<L>And cheers the nags with hoar&s;e eque&s;trian &s;trains.<MILESTONE N="30"></L>
<L>"Gee Rainbow, Peacock, Button, gee along</L>
<L>Then &s;quares her elbows, and confounds the throng</L>
<L>While her &s;oft bo&s;om too robu&s;tly feels,</L>
<L>A man like glory from her kindling wheels.</L>
<L>At the&s;e perhaps you have &s;ometimes laugh'd before,</L>
<L>Yet faith I wi&s;h you'd laugh at them once more.</L>
<L>I'd do my be&s;t to oblige you, as I live,</L>
<L>Then in return for once to oblige me &s;trive.</L>
<L>Nor now to modern France can we re&s;ort,</L>
<L>Murder and crimes make melancholy &s;port.<MILESTONE N="40"></L>
<L>Once, 'twas a happy land for all conditions,</L>
<L>Now, all is a&s;&s;ignats and requi&s;itions</L>
<L>Nor does the war with Holland promi&s;e much,</L>
<L>For who e'er brought home fancy from the Dutch?</L>
<L>Pepper and chee&s;e they had, let us not wrong 'em,</L>
<L>But &s;carce one &s;prig of bays e'er grew among 'em.</L>
<L><PB REF="93">The u&s;e of language as mo&s;t travellers tell</L>
<L>They think, was only given to buy and &s;ell,</L>
<L>And when three weighty words, the price is &s;poke,</L>
<L>Mynheer &s;inks down again to mum and &s;moke.<MILESTONE N="50"></L>
<L>But now 'tis time to drop the mimic art,</L>
<L>And breathe one wi&s;h that &s;wells each hone&s;t heart.</L>
<L>May Britain's &s;on's with victory by their &s;ide</L>
<L>Make Holland &s;hake, and humble Gallia's pride</L>
<L>The God of battle thro' all dangers guard 'em,</L>
<L>And their be&s;t meed, a Nation's thanks reward 'em!</L>
