<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I AM not ignorant, that <HI>as Times and the Humour of People go,</HI> it is a bold Adventure to write a Se|cond Volume of any thing; nor is the Succe&s;s of a Fir&s;t Part any Rule to expect Succe&s;s to a Second. On the Contrary, it is rather a Rule to ob|&s;truct it. The modern Readers of Books ha|ving a general Opinion <HI>which they entertain, like a fundamental Principle in Reading,</HI> That Second Parts never come up to the Spirit of the Fir&s;t; tho' perhaps here they may find an Exception to that Rule.</P>
<P>This was the Fate of that excellent Po|em of Mr. <HI>Milton<HI>'s, call'd, <HI>Paradi&s;e Re|gain'd;</HI> which, whether by the Error of com|mon Fame, or the real Value of the Thing, could never obtain to be nam'd with <HI>the Fir&s;t.</HI></HI></HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> him&s;elf differ'd from the whole World in his Opinion about it, affirm'd that it was by much the better Poem, and gave this Rea&s;on for the general Di&s;like, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That People had a common Sen&s;e of the Lo&s;s of Paradi&s;e, but had not an equal Gu&s;t for the Regaining of it; but his Judgment, however good, could not prevail.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay but little of the Rea&s;on why People may like or di&s;like the pre&s;ent Work. The fir&s;t Part of it gives the Story of Two very bad Wives; it would be &s;canda|lou&s;ly fooli&s;h and unju&s;t, to take Exceptions at my repre&s;enting the Women &s;o bad, as if I was partial again&s;t the Sex; but becau&s;e &s;ome may be weak enough to do &s;o, for want of under&s;tanding the Connexion of the Story, &s;uch are de&s;ir'd to ob&s;erve the clear Rea&s;on of it, as follows.</P>
<P>The Reproof is upon Husbands for omit|ting Family Wor&s;hip, and pretending the Fault is in their Wives; it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary then to repre&s;ent Two Wives ini|mitably bad, eminent for their Oppo&s;ition to every thing that was good in their Hus|bands, and in a Word, extravagantly wick|ed, to &s;hew that even in the&s;e extraordina|ry Ca&s;es, the Husband ought not to omit his Duty, and to infer, that if not in the&s;e Ca&s;es, certainly not in Ca&s;es le&s;s difficult, and con|&s;equently
<PB N="3" REF="4">
in no Ca&s;e at all. This is the true and only Rea&s;on of bringing Two &s;uch bad Wives upon the Stage, as is al&s;o ob&s;erv'd at large by Way of Note, upon that Part afterward, to which I refer.</P>
<P>If Novelty had only recomended the Fir&s;t Part, then indeed we might &s;ugge&s;t, that the Thoughts of People being once entertain'd, could no more be pleas'd again with the &s;ame Scheme: But this can no way affect us here; for if Novelty, <HI>the modern Vice of the read|ing Palate,</HI> is to jugde of our Performance, the whole Scene now pre&s;ented, is &s;o perfectly new, &s;o entirely differing from all that went before, and &s;o eminently directed to another Species of Readers, that it &s;eems to be more new than it would have been, if no other Part had been publi&s;h'd before it; nay, to any con&s;idering People that reflect upon the differ|ing Scenes of Human Life, and the &s;eve|ral Stations we are plac'd in, and Parts we act, while we are pa&s;&s;ing over this Stage; it cannot but be known, that there are Follies to be expo&s;ed, Dangers to be caution'd again&s;t, and Advices to be given, particularly adapt|ed to the &s;everal Stages of Life.</P>
<P>Upon this Account, in&s;tead of &s;ugge&s;ting that a Second Volume of this Work &s;hould be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than the Fir&s;t, I cannot but think they would either of them be imperfect
<PB N="4" REF="5">
without the other; and if the <HI>Turki&s;h Spy,</HI> and &s;uch other Books, from the known Varie|ty of them, have plea&s;ed and diverted the World, even to the Seventh or Eight Vo|lume: If this Subject is le&s;s plea&s;ing, and fails of running the &s;ame Length with tho&s;e loo&s;er Works, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e People have le&s;s Plea&s;ure in Things that are in&s;tructing, than in Things merely humouring and divert|ing; le&s;s Patience in bearing a ju&s;t Reproof, and le&s;s Humility in applying it to them|&s;elves than they ought to have.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s there are Duties in our relative Stations of every Sort, one to another, Du|ties from Parents to Children, and from Ma|&s;ters to Servants, as well as from Children to Parents, and from Servants to Ma&s;ters; and it mu&s;t be own'd by all that look narrowly in|to the&s;e Things, that as on the one hand there are great Mi&s;takes committed in the Govern|ment of them&s;elves and their Families, by Parents and Ma&s;ters, &s;o there is perhaps le&s;s &s;aid upon the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Heads in publick than upon any other; even the be&s;t Writers upon the Relative Duties, have &s;eemed to be wholly &s;ilent upon this Subject: whether they did not &s;ee into the Want of it, or thought it was a Point &s;o nice, that their Readers could not bear, or what other Thing has been the Hindrance, I know not.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
Correction! the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Part of Fa|mily-Government, and the be&s;t Part of Edu|cation, how difficult a Thing is it! How lit|tle under&s;tood! How generally wrong apply'd! Omitted in nece&s;&s;ary, and admini&s;tred in unne|ce&s;&s;ary Ca&s;es! The Nature, Rea&s;on, and End of it mi&s;taken! the Mea&s;ure of it taken not from the Circum&s;tances of the Childrens Offences, but from our own Tempers at that Time! How is it mingled with our Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;mother'd by our Affections, and in either Ca&s;e the U&s;e of it entirely de&s;troy'd! and what Advantage, to get above Correction, do Children make of the Mi&s;takes of their Parents in correcting them!</P>
<P>Mi&s;taken Parents may here be &s;et to rights in &s;ome of the mo&s;t dangerous Parts of that difficult Duty of correcting their Children: Here will be &s;hewn how incon&s;i&s;tent it is with the great and weighty Office of a Parent to conceal the Pa&s;&s;ions in their Rebukes, or to let their want of Temper add to the Weight of their Hands: Here they will be in&s;truct|ed in what Frame they ought to be when they Correct, and from what Principle their Hands mu&s;t be lifted up to &s;trike their own Fle&s;h and Blood: How they are to exhort, in&s;truct, expo&s;tulate, per&s;wade, with the ut|mo&s;t Te&s;timonies of Affection, all the while
<PB N="6" REF="7">
they are correcting: How incon&s;i&s;tent with correcting a Child, the Noi&s;e, the Rage, the Fury of our Pa&s;&s;ions are; and how often the true Parent corrects with more Tears in his own Eyes, than he brings out of the Eyes of the Child he cha&s;ti&s;es; and yet here he will &s;ee that this Tenderne&s;s mu&s;t not be permitted, to prevent or withold that whol&s;om Correcti|on, which Duty to the Child calls for, and which, if it be with-held, de&s;troys the Force of every other Part of his Education.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing more of what is here publi&s;hed, but this: The &s;ame De&s;ire of do|ing Good, which mov'd the Fir&s;t Part, has been &s;incerely and principally the Occa&s;ion of writing this Part. With all po&s;&s;ible Humi|lity and Thankfulne&s;s, I acknowledge and be|lieve I have had the &s;ame Pre&s;ence and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance; and I cannot but hope for the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ing and Succe&s;s; and with the Comfort and Confidence of this, I chearfully &s;end it into the World, not concern'd at all at the Oppo&s;ition it &s;hall meet with from the Infir|mities and Unworthine&s;s of its Author.</P>

<HEAD>The Fir&s;t DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS Di&s;cour&s;e is too much of Hi&s;tory, and was occa&s;ioned by an unhappy Quarrel be|tween a Man and his Wife, both &s;ober religious Per&s;ons, about their religious Conduct in their Family.</P>
<P>The Husband provok'd by &s;ome ra&s;h Words of his Wife's, and e&s;pecially by her &s;peaking &s;lightingly of his performing Family-Wor&s;hip, takes the wor&s;t Method in the World with him&s;elf, fling|ing away in a Pa&s;&s;ion, without calling his Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience of Duty to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and goes A|broad, having not called his Family together to Morn|ing-Prayer, as was before his con&s;tant Practice; and being gotten into a Field near his Hou&s;e, when he had the Advantage of conver&s;ing with him&s;elf, with|out being heard; his Pa&s;&s;ion being not much abated,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
you may &s;uppo&s;e, he fell to rea&s;oning him&s;elf <HI>out of</HI> his Duty, in&s;tead of <HI>into it,</HI> and to forming Argu|ments to ju&s;tify his laying a&s;ide the Thoughts of per|forming it for the future.</P>
<P>What can I do, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> when a Woman is arriv'd to &s;uch a height as to make a Mock of me in my own Family? She has brought Things to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that I do not think it is my Duty to pray among them any more; &s;he openly told me, <HI>before my Children,</HI> that I need not give my &s;elf the Trouble to keep up the Ceremony; that they none of them value it; that they hate the Offering for the &s;ake of the Prie&s;t; and that they care not to join with me, they can &s;erve God to more Purpo&s;e without me. <HI>Why,</HI> I don't think it is my Duty; certainly God does not expect I &s;hould wor&s;hip him in &s;uch Company; I am not to ca&s;t my Pearls before Swine: Be&s;ides, where there is no Charity, no Unity, what &s;ignifies Duty? what Wor&s;hip can there be, that can be acceptable to God or comfortable to me? I'll trouble my &s;elf no more about them; and as to its being my Duty, I think I am fairly di&s;charged of it; at her Door be the Sin, who has been the Cau&s;e of it; as I am not the Occa|&s;ion of the Breach, &s;o neither will the Con&s;equence lie at my Door; I'll perform my Duty by my &s;elf, and let them take their own Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>With this kind of Di&s;cour&s;e he &s;atisfied him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent; the Devil, no doubt, a&s;&s;i&s;ting; and coming home to his Family, took no Notice at the u&s;ual Time of Family-Wor&s;hip, but went unconcerned a|bout his Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;at down to Dinner at the Time of it, and at Night &s;tay'd abroad till it was time to go to Supper.</P>
<P>After Supper, his Wife, (who kept up her Re&s;ent|ment as high as he) calls her Maid to bring her a Candle, and away &s;he goes to Bed, taking no No|tice of him, or of the u&s;ual Family-Order.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">
It was a little unnatural to him, <HI>as it had been un|u&s;ual</HI> to clo&s;e the Day thus, without either his Duty to God, or any Society with his Wife; And, <HI>as he &s;aid afterwards,</HI> had &s;he &s;poken but one kind Word to him, or given him but a &s;ociable Look, he had forgot all, and gone on again in his Duty, as he u&s;ed to have done: But &s;he unwarily and imprudently prompting his Di&s;gu&s;t, and throwing Oil in&s;tead of Water into the Fire, enrag'd him again, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Temptation, to confirm him in the wicked Re&s;o|lution of neglecting of his Duty.</P>
<P>The Breach was now made, and every thing con|tributed to make it wider: The Man went to Bed &s;ome time after; but as &s;he was a&s;leep when he came to Bed, &s;o he was a&s;leep when &s;he ro&s;e, and they had no Interval or Opportunity of Conver&s;ation to allay their Heat, or bring them together: Thus they went on with their Di&s;content, and continued two or three Days hardly in &s;peaking Terms one with another; during which time, as there was no Reconciliation of their fooli&s;h Breach, &s;o it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed there was no complyance with one another in the Matter of religious Duty: But the Family Orders dropp'd, and Religion &s;eem'd wholly laid a&s;ide; and that which was &s;till wor&s;e, the Di&s;orders of their Minds was &s;o great, that it broke in upon their pri|vate Duties, as well as their publick, and one was neglected as well as the other. Indeed it might have been concluded, that had either of them retired to their private Duties; had they gone into their Clo&s;et and look'd up for Direction what to do, the &s;ecret Ejaculation would have &s;trongly moved them to ano|ther Frame, and &s;oon have returned them to their Duty, and re&s;tored them to one another.</P>
<P>A little time it is true, re&s;tor'd them to better Terms of Living together, the pa&s;&s;ionate Part cool'd again, and they conver&s;ed a little more
<PB N="4" REF="11">
friendly than before. <HI>But the Blow was given,</HI> the Religion of the Family was overthrown; and as the Woman, <HI>on one hand,</HI> &s;hewed no Concern about it, but &s;eemed to be much of the &s;ame Temper <HI>as to Charity</HI> as before, and not to de&s;ire his Performance; &s;o he bol&s;tring up his Neglect, and checking his Convictions with this Notion, <HI>That the Breach was upon his Wife, and not upon him;</HI> that &s;he had refus'd him, and that now it was not his Duty: Per&s;wading him&s;elf, I &s;ay, in this manner, he &s;eem'd to be &s;a|tisfied in the Omi&s;&s;ion, neither did he &s;eem to think of it any more.</P>
<P>It was to be ob&s;erved, that as they had now <HI>as it were</HI> lay'd a&s;ide their Family-Wor&s;hip, &s;o in the Na|ture of the thing, their Family Peace vani&s;hed; they were continually quarrelling, and falling out with one another; their Humours jo&s;tled in every Trifle, up|braiding one another's Sincerity, Affection, Integrity, on every little Occa&s;ion; reproaching the lea&s;t Mi&s;|carriage, reviling one another with Bitterne&s;s, and forgetting nothing that might tend to make them di&s;|agreeable to one another; peevi&s;h, wa&s;pi&s;h and fret|ful, even when they agreed be&s;t, and &s;candalou&s;ly furious, and hot when they fell out.</P>
<P>Hardly any Di&s;cour&s;e happen'd between them how|ever mildly it began, but it ended in a Broil; &s;he would thwart him in every thing he &s;aid, and he contradict her as often; their Orders in the Hou&s;e cla&s;h'd &s;o in every thing, that Children knew not how to behave, or Servants to obey; whil&s;t the Fa|ther commanded this, and the Mother that, it was impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve any Harmony among the Chil|dren; two of them, one Son and one Daughter, taking part with the Father; and another Son and two Daughters with the Mother; &s;o that as the Fa|ther and Mother differed, the Children differed, and that with &s;uch Heat, as to fill the Hou&s;e with Di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">
It happen'd once, that a Di&s;cour&s;e began between the Father and Mother about the Eclip&s;e of the Sun, which fell out in <HI>April</HI> 22. 1715.</P>
<P>The Eclip&s;e of the Sun was the Subject of all Con|ver&s;ation at that time, having been, as is well known, &s;o Total, and the Darkne&s;s &s;o great, as that the like had not been known in that Age, or &s;ome hundreds of Years before.</P>
<P>The Wife had enquired of her Husband, what the Nature of the Thing was, and he was de&s;cribing it to her and the Children in a familiar way; and, as I &s;aid, that a kind of Reflection upon one another was the u&s;ual I&s;&s;ue of their common Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o it was there; the Husband tells her, that the Moon was like a cro&s;s Wife, that when &s;he was out of Humour, could Thwart and Eclip&s;e her Husband whenever &s;he plea&s;ed; and that if an ill Wife &s;tood in the Way, the brighte&s;t Husband could not &s;hine.</P>
<P>She flew in a Pa&s;&s;ion at this, and being of a &s;harp Wit, you do well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> to carry your Emblem to a &s;uitable height; <HI>I warrant,</HI> you think a Wife, like the Moon, has no Light but what &s;he borrows from her Husband, and that we can only &s;hine by Reflecti|on; it is nece&s;&s;ary then you &s;hould know, &s;he can Eclip&s;e him when &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Ay, ay, <HI>&s;ays the Husband,</HI> but you &s;ee when &s;he does, &s;he darkens the whole Hou&s;e, &s;he can give no Light without him.</P>
<STAGE>&V;pon this &s;he came clo&s;er to him.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you think you have been Eclips'd lately, we don't &s;ee the Hou&s;e is the darker for it.</P>

<STAGE>It's evident that both meant here, his having left off Family-Wor&s;hip; and it is apparent, both were come to a dreadful Extremity in their Quarrel.</STAGE>

<P>I don't think it a Sin in me to refrain Pub|lick Prayer among tho&s;e that contemn it, and who re|ject it for my &s;ake; I am forbid to ca&s;t Pearls before Swine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, your Wife and Children are all Swine with you, and are treated like &s;uch by you; and becau&s;e you want an Excu&s;e for Neglect of your Duty, therefore we are all Swine. The Com|pari&s;on is &s;omething &s;wini&s;h, I think, on your Part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Authority is good, the very Compari&s;on the Scripture makes of tho&s;e that trample Religion under their Feet, and fly in the Faces of tho&s;e that offer to Officiate: They are Swine in both, for they make Dirt of Religion, and turn again and rent tho&s;e who offer it; <HI>that is,</HI> de&s;pi&s;e them, and a&s;&s;ault them, de&s;pi&s;e them as unworthy; which is the Ca&s;e exactly.</P>

<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know the Nature of Family-Wor|&s;hip; is it not that the whole Family may &s;hew their Agreement and Harmony, in acknowledging and &s;erving God? If Half the Family, or any of the Fa|mily &s;eparate, it is a <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> in the Hou&s;e; and the Unity being broke, the re&s;t is but private Wor&s;hip, and may as well be done alone. I do not think I am at all required to perform Family-Wor&s;hip, if my Family refu&s;es to join.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine Delu&s;ion of the Devil! or rather an Artifice to throw your Burden upon me, there's no|thing in it; when you reform your Life, no Body will &s;light your Performance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have no Crime to charge me with but want of Obedience to my Wife; when you fir&s;t return to your Duty, I &s;hall think my &s;elf o|blig'd to return to mine.</P>
</SP>
<P>All this while here was no Abatement on one &s;ide or other, and both of them dreadfully mi&s;taken a|bout their Duty; they wrangl'd thus upon every Oc|ca&s;ion, and this la&s;t Dialogue is only given as a Skerch of their almo&s;t daily Conver&s;ation: Their Commu|nication was poi&s;on'd by the Breach in their Affecti|on, and like the &s;weet Dews which falling into the Sea, become Salt like the Ocean; &s;o the mo&s;t ca&s;ual innocent Di&s;cour&s;e between them, generally i&s;&s;ued in a Broil: yet none of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es brought them together, as they might have done; or convinc'd them that both were in the Wrong, &s;o as to have pro|duc'd a Return to their Duty, or at lea&s;t a Truce, that they might not have let their Contention have hin|dred their religious Performance. But Pa&s;&s;ion pre|vailing, they continued in a dreadful Cour&s;e of Ir|religion, and re&s;training Prayer before God.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that while thus they laid a&s;ide the Appearance of Religion in their Families,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
it abated in the re&s;t of their Conver&s;ation, and they grew entirely carele&s;s, living as it were without God in the World; the Decay of Family-Wor&s;hip, like a Gan-green in the religious Body, &s;pread it &s;elf from one Limb to another, till it affected the Vitals, and pro|ved mortal. In a word, it de&s;troyed the Sen&s;e of Duty and Religion in their whole Lives.</P>
<P>And as Sin entred in by this Breach, &s;o it made way for every other Breach; which made them more and more peevi&s;h, wa&s;pi&s;h, apt to quarrel and &s;narle at the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion; removed all that Sweet|ne&s;s of Conver&s;ation and Harmony of Affection that was between them before, and the Hou&s;e became de&s;titute, not of Religion only, but of every plea&s;ant thing.</P>
<P>It happen'd &s;ome time after this, that this Gentle|man had an intimate Friend, who liv'd Thirty or Forty Miles off in the Country, who had likewi&s;e a Wife that had brought him almo&s;t into the &s;ame Dif|ficulty, tho' from a differing Occa&s;ion; for &s;he was a profane, irreligious, and negligent Per&s;on, as to Re|ligion, from her Original; by Education a Mock|er and De&s;pi&s;er of all that was Good, and one who did her utmo&s;t to di&s;courage her Husband, who was a good Man, from all his Mea&s;ures in the religious Government of him&s;elf, or of his Family.</P>
<P>He had had a great Quarrel with his Wife about her Conduct, and her reproaching him for doing his Duty; and &s;he had &s;aid &s;ome &s;uch &s;hocking Things to him, that almo&s;t conquer'd his Re&s;olutions in the Matter of his Duty; almo&s;t the &s;ame Temptation of|fering to him, as had been the Ca&s;e of the other Per|&s;on mentioned before: For a while, this good Man began to waver in his Re&s;olution; but his Sen&s;e of Duty return'd upon him too &s;trongly to be re&s;i&s;ted, and he ma&s;ter'd all the Difficulties that were before him; re&s;olv'd, that let Satan and a perver&s;e Woman
<PB N="9" REF="16">
do their utmo&s;t, he would not live without the Wor|&s;hip and Service of God in his Hou&s;e: And &s;o he went on with his Duty in &s;pight of all his Wife's Clamour, made his whole Hou&s;e &s;ubmit to it, and condemn her for oppo&s;ing it, as we &s;hall hear more particularly pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>This good Man coming to Town, and meeting with his old Friend, of whom we have been &s;peak|ing, and both being intimate Chri&s;tians as well as Ac|quaintance, it was not long before they began to con|ver&s;e about religious Affairs, as well as Things u&s;ual in common Di&s;cour&s;e; both being al&s;o too full of their re&s;pective Family Grievances, to be long toge|ther before they unbo&s;om'd them&s;elves to one ano|ther, which produc'd the following Dialogue.</P>
<P>Says the <HI>Citizen</HI> to his <HI>Friend.</HI> Well, old Friend, I hear you have been marry'd &s;ince we met la&s;t, and I mu&s;t give you Joy; I hope it is to your Satisfaction.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>There indeed you touch me to the Soul; there's the Blot with which I reproach my &s;elf, and which gives me no Peace, <HI>I read my Sin in my Puni&s;h|ment;</HI> I look'd another way, I troubled not my Thoughts about Religion, I look'd at the Money, I went for it, and I had it; and now I feel the Cur&s;e that came with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, tho' you did look at the Money, &s;ure there are Women who have Money too, that have the Ble&s;&s;ing of a religious Education; they are not all Athei&s;ts that have Money; nor are all the pious, religious Women Beggars. Certainly you were in great Ha&s;te, and look'd little before you in your Choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I run into the Devil's Mouth, I &s;ingl'd out a Family where nothing was to be expected; a Hou&s;e, where I may &s;ay without Breach of Charity, God had not been within the Doors for &s;ome Ages: I tell you, as I &s;aid before, I ought not to &s;ay I am di&s;appointed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, you have &s;ome Rea&s;on to blame your own Conduct in that regard; for I know nothing more uncomfortable, than for a Man that knows any thing of Religion, to be match'd to a Woman that has no Notion of her Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blame my Conduct! do you carry it no far|ther? Without doubt, I committed the greate&s;t Sin of its kind that I was capable of, and mo&s;t ju&s;tly pro|voked God to make that Relation, which ought to have been my Comfort and Ble&s;&s;ing, be my Snare, my Temptation, and at be&s;t, my con&s;tant Affliction.</P>
</SP>

<P>It is indeed again&s;t the expre&s;s Rule which the

Apo&s;tle lays down, <HI>Be not unequally Yoak'd.</HI> I believe, for a Man or Woman that is religious enclin'd, to marry a Per&s;on of no Religion, or to marry a Per&s;on of differing Principles in Religion from them&s;elves, is po&s;itively forbidden in that Text.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! it is not only again&s;t the Apo&s;tle's Rule, but it is again&s;t all the Rules of Religion, of Nature, and of common Sen&s;e: What Communication can there be between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Belial?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it was the Rea&s;on given in Scripture, why God commanded the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> not to give their Daughters to the Sons of the Heathen, nor take their Daughters to Wife, le&s;t <HI>they &s;hould be drawn in to &s;erve their Gods, and to for&s;ake the Lord their God,</HI> Judges 1.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I think &s;he is wor&s;e; for &s;he de&s;pi&s;es all Wor&s;hip, whether of the fal&s;e Gods, or of the True; I know no Sen&s;e &s;he has of any Religion at all, other than to make a Mock at it, to make all &s;erious Things her Sport, and to banter tho&s;e that dare not do &s;o too.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, &s;he goes to Church, and is a Prote|&s;tant, &s;uch a kind of Prote&s;tant as this Age is too full of; I think &s;he had as good be a Papi&s;t, for then &s;he would make &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ion, and might, in Time, be brought over to the true Profe&s;&s;ion of right Prin|ciples;
<PB N="13" REF="20">
but as &s;he is, I think there is more hopes of a Heathen than of her, for he wor&s;hips &s;omething, but &s;he neither fears God or Devil.</P>

<P>Do there! why, &s;tare about her, or &s;leep, or furni&s;h her &s;elf with &s;omething or other to banter the Infirmities of the Mini&s;ter. I never hear her talk a Word of what &s;he hears, except it be to ri|dicule and expo&s;e it. The unhappy Wit &s;he is Mi|&s;tre&s;s of, and which &s;he might make a much better u&s;e of, exerts it &s;elf this way; and when &s;he can no longer run down all revealed Religion, nay and na|tural Religion too, then the Failings, Slips, and Mi|&s;takes of the Mini&s;ters and Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion employ her Tongue, which makes my Hou&s;e a Tem|ple of the Devil to me; where I can hear nothing but Abu&s;es upon God, the Wor&s;hip and Servants of God, and every thing that is good, till I am made to abhor the Conver&s;ation of my own Family.</P>

<P>I'll an&s;wer you in one word, MONEY! MONEY! This was the Snare; the Devil laid the Hook, and I bit at the Bait. It is true, I was better taught, and my Father had propo&s;ed &s;everal tolera|ble Matches for me in our Neighbourhood; Wo|men

Nor were my Mea&s;ures for fur|ni&s;hing my &s;elf with a Wife le&s;s extravagant than the Humour I profe&s;s'd to act by; for as I cared not who I took, &s;o I car'd not where I found her: and as he that abandons him&s;elf is ju&s;tly abandon'd by Provi|dence, &s;o in pur&s;uit of the Idol I wor&s;hip'd, I went to the Temple of Wickedne&s;s, the Play-Hou&s;e, a thing I had not been bred to I a&s;&s;ure you, and when the Devil had me in his Bounds, he took care to hold me fa&s;t.

<P>I cannot &s;ay, but that if I would have conform'd to her wicked abominable loo&s;e Way of Living, &s;he might have loved me well enough; but as &s;oon as &s;he found my Way of Living was different from what &s;he expected, &s;he became unea&s;y and indiffe|rent,
<PB N="15" REF="22">
till at la&s;t it grew up to a perfect Contempt; and it often makes &s;uch Breaches between us, as in Time mu&s;t certainly root out all manner of conjugal Affection on either Side.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s, I cannot &s;ay but it wears out what Love I had for her apace; for it is impo&s;&s;ible while I abhor her Conduct and cannot reclaim her, that I can pre&s;erve my Affection for her: Vertuous Love is founded upon two things only, both which are want|ing in her, <HI>Merit</HI> and <HI>Suitability.</HI> What Merit can there be in one who appears to have a general Con|tempt of all that is Good? and what Suitability can there be in two Tempers &s;o extreamly oppo&s;ite?</P>

I know it by my &s;elf, there can be no Family-Wor&s;hip, where there is no Family Love: Who can kneel down to pray with tho&s;e that ridicule and contemn it, or perhaps refu&s;e to joyn?

<P>Why, I'll give you a Pa&s;&s;age or two; you mu&s;t know, that for three or four Days while our Wed|ding was upon the Wheel, and a pretty many Friends in the Hou&s;e, &s;ome of the neighbouring Clergy were continually there; either the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, or of the next Pari&s;h, or a Gentleman's Chap|lain that liv'd about a Mile off; and once or twice a Presbyterian Clergyman, who kept the Meeting|hou&s;e in the Town, and to whom I found not Sir <HI>Ri|chard</HI> . . . . . . only, but even the Mini&s;ter of the Pa|ri&s;h behav'd very re&s;pectfully; and as he was a Man of Worth and a very good Scholar, they were very intimate together. While the&s;e were there, as I &s;aid, there was always &s;ome or other to &s;ay the
<PB N="19" REF="26">
Grace, as they call it, at Table. But as for Prayers at Night, that was never offer'd, or perhaps thought on.</P>
<P>It happen'd at length we all &s;at down to Table without a Chaplain, and as Sir <HI>Richard</HI> made no of|fer to &s;tand up, &s;o no &s;ooner was the Dinner &s;et on, and the Ladies plac'd, but my Lady . . . . . . had her Knife in a boil'd Turkey, and we all fell to work as decently, and with as little regard to him who&s;e Hand fill'd us, as any Pack of Hounds in the Country.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you &s;hall hear how &s;he &s;erv'd me, and how hand&s;omely &s;he was &s;erv'd for it by her own Brother: She kept her Word with me about a Week; but one Evening, as we were at Supper, &s;he made a Motion to me, and &s;eem'd to &s;mile: I kept my Countenance as long as &s;he kept it from being taken Notice of; but &s;he took care to let Sir <HI>Richard</HI> ..... &s;ee her, who, as he was a merry Man, and full of good Humour, would needs know what the Matter was; &s;he points to me, <HI>Let him tell you,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, for he won't let me. Sir <HI>Richard</HI> pre&s;s'd me, and I blu&s;h'd as red as the Colour of Blood would allow; at length my Wife &s;aid,</P>
<P>Nay, Mr. ...... it is not &s;uch a mighty Thing, you may tell it.</P>
<P>No, my Dear, &s;aid I, I am &s;ure I &s;han't; and I am &s;ure you won't.</P>
<P>This made the Ca&s;e wor&s;e, for they were doubly importunate then; and Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> who always thought it had been &s;ome little Je&s;t or other, lays hold of his Si&s;ter, and &s;wore &s;he &s;hould tell him.</P>
<P>I interceeded with him and per&s;uaded him, told him &s;he had engag'd to me not to &s;peak of it, and I hop'd he would not make her break the fir&s;t Promi&s;e that ever I ask'd her to make, &s;ince &s;he was my Wife.</P>
<P>My Wife turn'd upon me, and would have me re|linqui&s;h her Promi&s;e; I told her I could not; in a Word, it began to warm us on all Hands, and my Wife in particular, told me I us'd her ill.</P>
<P>My Dear, &s;aid I, 'tis very hard you &s;hould &s;ay &s;o, when you know you are only de&s;ir'd to conceal one of my Faults.</P>
<P>I know no Fault in it, &s;ays &s;he; and if it be, I de&s;ire to conceal none of your Faults.</P>
<P>But if you don't <HI>my Dear,</HI> &s;aid I, you will expo&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="29">
me very much, for you will find I have a great many Faults wor&s;e than this, that I hope no Body &s;hall know but your &s;elf.</P>
<P>She was afraid I had, <HI>&s;he &s;aid;</HI> and this had given her &s;uch a Surfeit of me, that if the re&s;t were much wor&s;e, &s;he was afraid they would give her a Vomit, that would bring up all her Love.</P>
<P>My Dear, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I hope that lies too deep for &s;uch a &s;light Operation. I was going to &s;ay more, but I &s;aw &s;he was in a Rage, &s;o I forbore.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, I don't know whether it does or no; and with tho&s;e Words ro&s;e from the Table and went up Stairs.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard. . . . . .</HI> the be&s;t humour'd Man in the World, run and took hold of her, &s;wore &s;he &s;hould not go, and drag'd her back a good way, but &s;he flung from him; I followed her, but &s;he was too nimble for me, and got into her Room, and with flinging the Door after her, and I too near her, &s;truck me on the No&s;e, and &s;et me a bleeding mo&s;t violently.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure this Carriage and my Bleeding &s;poil'd our Mirth, and indeed our Supper; nor could my Lady. . . . . or another Si&s;ter prevail with her to come out of her Chamber, or let me in for &s;ome Hours; indeed, when &s;he heard of my Bleeding, and had opened the Door after I was gone down, and &s;een how much I had bleed upon the Stair-head be|fore a Servant could be call'd with a Ba&s;on and Towel, &s;he was much concerned, and &s;ent her Maid down to &s;ee how I did.</P>
<P>In the Interim of this Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> who appeared very much concern'd at what had had happen'd, came to me, and &s;miling &s;aid, Brother, I am very &s;or|ry that I &s;hould be in&s;trumental to put my Si&s;ter out of Humour, e&s;pecially with you; and I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, I never knew her &s;o much out in her Behaviour in my Life.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30">
Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> it would have been no Trouble to me, if it had not been that the Thing it&s;elf was from &s;omething I had fooli&s;hly let fall, which if &s;he had told in her Way, would have made you think me wanting in my Re&s;pect to you, which of all Things in the World I would give no occa&s;ion for, having been treated &s;o obligingly by you, ever &s;ince I had the Honour to be related to you.</P>
<P>Come Brother, &s;ays Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> here's my Hand and my Word, it &s;hall move no &s;uch Imaginations in me; be&s;ides, I would not have pre&s;s'd her, if I had thought in the lea&s;t it had related to me.</P>
<P>Indeed Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> &s;aid I, it had not the lea&s;t Di&s;re&s;pect in it to you; yet I freely own, I &s;hould not have &s;aid it, no not to my own Wife.</P>
<P>And I freely own, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> my Si&s;ter is in the wrong if it be &s;o, for it's hard a Man cannot &s;peak a Word in his Bed-Chamber to his own Wife, but &s;he mu&s;t betray him; O the&s;e Wives, &s;ays he &s;miling, are &s;uch Bo&s;om Friends!

<P>Well, Sir <HI>Richard. . . . . . .</HI> &s;aid I, however, I hear|tily ask your Pardon for what I &s;aid, whether &s;he tells it or not; and I acknowledge it was what did not become me to &s;ay, nor was it any of my Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Says Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> Let it be what it will, and whe|ther I know it or no, I give you my Promi&s;e, Bro|ther, I will not take any thing ill from you.</P>
<P>Come, &s;ays my Lady, who &s;at by all this while, my Brother makes more of it than he needs, and his Mode&s;ty in it is too much his own Di&s;advantage; I have the Secret, and he &s;hall give me leave to tell it; I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> neither you or I have any Rea&s;on to take it ill, tho' I mu&s;t blame my Si&s;ter too.</P>

<P>In the Morning &s;he asked me if I intended to dine from her again? I &s;aid, <HI>No my Dear,</HI> and &s;mil'd, at which &s;he &s;eem'd very well pleas'd.</P>

<P>Upon a &s;erious Reflection in this Manner on the Neglect of my own Duty, and how ju&s;tly &s;he had reproach'd me with her <HI>not having hindered me,</HI> I re|&s;olved that as this good Man was likely to begin &s;et|ting

up good Order and Wor&s;hip of GOD in my Hou&s;e, I would endeavour to keep it up when he was gone: And another Circum&s;tance happened to make this Work ea&s;ier to me than I expected.</P>
<P>It happened that our Uncle the Mini&s;ter had not been two Days in the Hou&s;e, but he was taken very Lame of the Gout; and after that had lock'd him in for near two Months, he fell into an Ague, which held him almo&s;t two more; &s;o that we had his Com|pany near four Months, to my great Satisfaction, and no le&s;s to the Affliction of my Wife.</P>
<P>The good old Man being Lame, as above, call'd me to him one Morning, and told me he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with me; when he began very &s;eriou&s;ly to talk with me upon the Subject of <HI>Family Wor&s;hip,</HI> and we talk'd of it in the following Manner.</P>

I know, Cou&s;in, &s;ays he, you are but new marry'd, and perhaps your Wife and you may not yet have enquired of one another, what of this kind may be your Duty: But as I have taken upon me to pre&s;s you to this Work, as your Duty, I take it upon me likewi&s;e to an&s;wer for your Wife, that &s;he will not be any Hindrance to you; nay, &s;he has own'd to me, that &s;he is de&s;irous of it, and will do all that lies in her to encourage you in it.</P>

<P>When my Wife was gone, I thank'd the good Gentleman very &s;incerely, and told him how glad I was of the Step he had taken; yet I own'd to him, that I thought my Wife had come into it rather to oblige him, than from any &s;incere Regard to the Duty it &s;elf.</P>

<P>You mi&s;take me very much, it has not been plea&s;ant to hear that you have been under &s;uch a &s;evere Affliction; but it was a great Plea&s;ure to me, to find a dear Friend in a Ca&s;e, from which I was &s;o likely to receive In&s;truction, Comfort and Advice in my own, which is almo&s;t the &s;ame in every Circum&s;tance, and in which I have been &s;o much at a lo&s;s how to behave, that I have neither known what to do, or who to go to for Advice.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>In one Particular do you &s;ay? I think it is wor&s;e in many Particulars. It is wor&s;e in what I &s;aid above, that I think my Wife will be harder to reclaim than yours; becau&s;e &s;he pretends at lea&s;t to think her &s;elf already in the right, and that I am the Profligate and the Enemy to Religion. Your Wife cannnot think &s;he is right, only carries it on upon the Foot of an entire Neglect of Right or Wrong; not being touch'd with any Conviction, but being ju&s;t in the original State we &s;hould all have been in, but for the Advantages of a better Education; there's all the Room for the Grace of GOD to work in that can be expected; nay, &s;uch are the proper Field in which GOD is often plea&s;ed to di&s;play the Glory of redeeming Mercy and the Soveraignty of his Grace: <HI>When thou wert ca&s;t out to the Loathing of thy Per&s;on, when thou wert in thy Blood, I &s;aid unto thee, Live.</HI> But <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Hypocrites &s;eem to be the Ab|horrence even of the Spirit of GOD, and it is at lea&s;t very rarely that &s;uch are brought back.</P>

<P>I a&s;&s;ure you I do her no Wrong, I rather con|ceal and cover her Behaviour than make it wor&s;e: But then I have two Circum&s;tances more which make my Ca&s;e wor&s;e than yours. 1. My Children are grown up, &s;o far at lea&s;t as to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves in the Debate; and Three of them out of Five, take part with their Mother, prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd by her deluding Tongue, and by the Advantage &s;he has, of being always with them, and wheedling and cry|ing to them; &s;o that they carry it almo&s;t as in&s;olent|ly to me as my Wife, and e&s;pecially in this part, of de&s;pi&s;ing and &s;corning the needful Union which the Duty of our Family calls for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what is the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the other is the greate&s;t Affliction to me of all the re&s;t <HI>(viz.)</HI> that by this abu&s;ive bruti&s;h Be|haviour of my Wife and Children, my Family is quite unhing'd, all Appearance of Order and Duty is lo&s;t, my Servants and my other Children are let loo&s;e to the World, and are like Sheep without a Shepherd, like People without Government, we have no Wor&s;hip of GOD among us; my Wife and her three Children go up Stairs, and there &s;he pretends to pray and read with them by her &s;elf, as if her Husband was a Hea|then, her other Children Out-ca&s;ts, and her Family Reprobates, and I am quite di&s;tracted between the Sen&s;e of my Duty and the Impo&s;&s;ibility of perform|ing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark ye, <HI>my Friend,</HI> this is a &s;ad Ca&s;e 'tis true, but give me leave to tell you that this is not really &s;o much Matter for your Affliction as of your Repen|tance; for I &s;ee little or nothing in all this but what lies at your own Door, and is in your Power to re|ctify, and which you mu&s;t &s;et to work immediately to rectify, or your Family will be ruin'd and undone, and your &s;elf too.</P>

<P>What can I do? Can I reform a perver&s;e Wo|man?

Can I reduce an ob&s;tinate Temper? Am I in GOD's &s;tead! Can I convince a Hypocrite, who&s;e Pride fortifies her again&s;t Rea&s;on or Scripture, and who&s;e Vanity makes her de&s;pi&s;e Reproof? How can you have &s;o little Charity as to &s;ay, it all lies at my Door?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>my Friend,</HI> do not be full of your own Ca&s;e; I do not &s;ay you can work upon your Wife; and I acknowledge what you &s;aid, that &s;uch a Tem|per is harder to be touch'd than any other; &s;piritual Pride is the &s;tronge&s;t Fortre&s;s of the Devil in our Hearts, and which he is harde&s;t to be beaten out of; this is not what I &s;poke of; but what is this to your doing your own Duty?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, <HI>my Dear Friend,</HI> let me tell you, this was my Temptation, as it has been yours, but I ble&s;s GOD I got over it; your great Mi&s;take has been, that you went out into the Fields, as you &s;aid, and con&s;ulted with your Enemy; had you look'd in|to your own Con&s;cience, or into the Word of GOD, the faithful Coun&s;ellors of all that &s;incerely con&s;ult with them, you would have found the Difference; you con&s;ulted your Pa&s;&s;ions, your Re&s;entment, and the ju&s;t Cau&s;e your Wife had given you to be angry; and the Devil, who watches all Advantages, took you by the right Handle; and thus you argued your &s;elf out of your Duty, in&s;tead of arguing your &s;elf into it.</P>

<P>Why, what could I do? Was it not enough to provoke the calme&s;t Man alive to a Pa&s;&s;ion?</P>

<P>I'll allow that too; but remember this, whoever he is, that when (tho' by the mo&s;t injurious Treatment) provok'd, &s;hall con&s;ult with his own Pa&s;&s;ions only,
<PB N="44" REF="53">
he &s;hall be &s;ure to be wrong; you &s;hould have &s;um|mon'd your Rea&s;on; you &s;hould have con&s;ulted Con|&s;cience; in a Word, you &s;hould have looked up to GOD for Direction what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That is true, I confe&s;s it; but I do not now &s;ee after all my Pa&s;&s;ion is over, what I could do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, if I &s;hould tell you the Cour&s;e I took, you will an&s;wer, that my Ca&s;e is not like yours, <HI>and perhaps it is not;</HI> but you do not know but the &s;ame Method pur&s;ued in your Ca&s;e, might have brought with it &s;ecret In&s;truction, equal to your Difficulty, as it did to mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be willing to take any Advice, for my Ca&s;e is indeed deplorable; I have no Peace Night nor Day, to &s;ee the Ruin of my Family, and to live in a con&s;tant Breach of known Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as I told you, my Temptation was the &s;ame with yours; and perhaps the Arguments again&s;t my Duty were &s;tronger, for I had no Family, no Children but one half a Year old; &s;o it naturally of|fer'd to me thus, Why <HI>let her alone,</HI> if &s;he will be a Heathen, and die like a Heathen, what can I do? I mu&s;t retire my &s;elf; &s;eeing &s;he will not let me pray with her, I mu&s;t pray by my &s;elf, and pray for her; and wait the Time when it may plea&s;e GOD to re|claim her, and then I may &s;et up Family-Wor&s;hip a|gain: This went a great way with me, and I argued ju&s;t as you did, that it was not my Duty to offer the Wor&s;hip of GOD to the Contempt of a Scoffer; that there could be no Compo&s;ure, no Engagement of the Affections, no Energy in Prayer, where I knew I was ridicul'd and laugh'd at by her that &s;hould join with me; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould pray to my own Edification, or to the Profit of others in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, and therefore I would not pray at all.</P>
<P>In this Strait I continu'd &s;ome Time, e&s;pecially
<PB N="45" REF="54">
on the Occa&s;ion of an unhappy Breach between us, <HI>in which</HI> my Wife had particularly vented her &s;elf with all that Bitterne&s;s and Banter which her unhap|py Wit furni&s;hes her too much with, on the Account of my praying in my Family.</P>
<P>But after my Pa&s;&s;ion was abated, I con&s;ider'd calmly, that for me to omit my Duty, becau&s;e my Wife would nor do hers, had no manner of Cohe|rence with it &s;elf, any more than that I &s;hould not eat my Meat if my Wife would not eat hers; I look'd upon praying to GOD, as not my indi&s;pen|&s;able Duty only, but as an ine&s;timable Privilege, and that to abate it for the Mi&s;take of a weak or wicked Woman, was to puni&s;h my &s;elf, not to puni&s;h her: I remembered an unhappy Accident which happen'd in the Town where I live, That a poor Man, a Shoe-maker, who had a very turbulent provoking Wife, and being driven into Pa&s;&s;ions and De&s;parati|on by her wicked U&s;age of him, &s;tab'd him&s;elf with his Knife; it came fre&s;h into my Mind how univer|&s;ally all the Neighbours condemned him as guilty of Self-Murder; and how in particular I was one of the forwarde&s;t to cen&s;ure him on that very Account, and to &s;ay, that to kill him&s;elf becau&s;e his Wife was unkind, was making one Affliction two, &s;o was irrational; and which was wor&s;e, made her Sin again&s;t him be an occa&s;ion of his Sin again&s;t GOD and him&s;elf, which was a horrible Wicked|ne&s;s: As I thought upon this, I then argued with my &s;elf thus; By this Woman's Unkindne&s;s, I am rob'd of the Comfort of my Family, and of the Expectation I had from her as a Relation; but if I omit my Du|ty, I then rob my &s;elf of my Peace, &s;in again&s;t GOD and my Family, and open a Door to all manner of Sin and Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations I immediately lifted up my Heart for Direction to him who has &s;aid, <HI>If any</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="55">
<HI>Man want Wi&s;dom, let him ask it of GOD:</HI> Imme|diately came to my Mind the Words of <HI>JOSH&V;A</HI> to the People of <HI>I&s;rael, As for me and my Hou&s;e, WE WILL &s;erve the LORD;</HI> the Story of <HI>DANIEL,</HI> who would not, no not to avoid the being devoured by Lyons, omit his Publick, and perhaps Family Wor&s;hip: It pre&s;ently offered then, that <HI>Daniel</HI> might have &s;atisfy'd him&s;elf with his private Retirement, and performed his private Prayer in his Clo&s;et, and this he might have done with Safety; but then he had &s;eem'd to yield up the Point to his Enemies, and to grant that his Life was of more Concern to him than his Duty to GOD, which he abhorred the Thought of, and therefore continued his Duty at the utmo&s;t Hazard.</P>

<P>Indeed you took a different Cour&s;e from mine, and you met with A&s;&s;i&s;tance from it, which I wanted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately, upon this, I re&s;olved to do my Duty, whatever Oppo&s;ition I met with; and withal, that if my Wife continued to be ob&s;tinate, I would take upon me to let her know, that if &s;he would not &s;ub|mit to attend the Wor&s;hip of GOD decently, and with that Reverence as &s;he ought to do in the Fami|ly, &s;he &s;hould &s;ubmit to be ab&s;ent, and &s;hould &s;ee her &s;elf thru&s;t out, as not fit to be admitted to the Wor&s;hip of her Maker in Company with her Fami|ly, till &s;he thought fit to behave as became her.</P>

<P>Truly I cannot give you much Account of that Part yet; for my Bu&s;ine&s;s calling me to <HI>London</HI> &s;oon after, I was oblig'd to leave her before her Temper had brought her &s;o much as to think it any Affront, for at fir&s;t &s;he &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed with it.</P>

<P>You have been both a wi&s;er Man and a better Chri&s;tian than I; for like a Fool I gave way to my Pa&s;&s;ions, without making u&s;e of my Rea&s;on; and, like a Man void of Religion, I gave up my Duty a Sacrifice to the Wickedne&s;s and Pride of a Woman; and now &s;he glories in my Shame, for &s;he upbraids me with living void of Religion, without the Sence of it upon my Mind, or the Face of it upon my Be|haviour; and &s;he has &s;o much Truth on her &s;ide, as to Fact, tho' &s;he her &s;elf has been the unhappy Occa|&s;ion, that her Words are as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>like the pier|cing of a Sword.</HI> I cannot an&s;wer her, for I am con|vinc'd, that however wicked &s;he had been, however &s;harp her Taunts and Reproaches, however contemp|tibly &s;he might &s;peak or think of my Performance, I ought to have done my Duty.</P>

<HEAD>The Second DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Conference between the Two Friends in the la&s;t Dialogue, left them almo&s;t in the &s;ame Condition; both of them being oppo|&s;ed in the Performance of their Family Duty by their Wives, and both of them re&s;olv'd to go on in the Way of their Duty, and to keep up the Wor&s;hip of GOD in their Families, whether their Wives would or not.</P>
<P>For the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Country Gentleman had opened the Eyes of the Citizen; and he re&s;olved to
<PB N="51" REF="60">
follow his Example; tho' as he had mo&s;t ea&s;ily given up his Duty at fir&s;t, &s;o he had far the greater Diffi|culty in bringing his Family to a Compliance after|wards, as will pre&s;ently appear.</P>
<P>When he came home the &s;ame Evening from his Friend, he &s;at pen&s;ive and melancholy a good while, mu&s;ing with him&s;elf what Cour&s;e he &s;hould take with his Wife; his Re&s;olution to take upon him&s;elf the Government of his Family had not failed him, but he was &s;o ruffled by his Wife before in the Ca&s;e of his Performance, that he hardly knew in what manner to go about it, nor how to manage it; he was loth to &s;hut his Wife out of the Room, and yet was afraid of her going away, and taking away tho&s;e Three Children with her, who, as was &s;aid, had &s;ided with her again&s;t him, and who he was re&s;olved &s;hould attend him at his publick Wor&s;hip; however, it &s;o happened to his great Mortification, that going but out of the Room into a Clo&s;et for &s;ome particular Occa&s;ion, his Wife in the Interval goes away with her younge&s;t Son, and her two elde&s;t Daughters, and retiring to her own Apartment, continued there near an Hour.</P>
<P>This &s;o &s;urprized, and which was wor&s;e, &s;o di&s;|compo&s;ed him, that together with &s;ome unkind Words which pa&s;s'd afterwards between him and his Wife, and which put him into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, he was quite unfitted for his Duty for that Night; and, <HI>as he &s;aid afterwords,</HI> it had &s;o di&s;couraged him, that he was almo&s;t at the Point to have given over the happy Re&s;olution he had taken of returning to his Family Performance; however, it quite broke off his Thoughts of it, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> for <HI>that Night.</HI></P>
<P>In the Morning he compo&s;ed his Mind as well as he could, and re&s;olved to enter upon his Work, whe|ther his Wife con&s;ented or not; and yet being wil|ing to have it all managed, as it ought to be, in a lov|ing
<PB N="52" REF="61">
and Chri&s;tian Manner, if he could, he re&s;olved to di&s;cour&s;e with his Wife fir&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring her to Compliance with him, and to a Sen&s;e of her Duty both to GOD and her Husband; and I think the following Di&s;cour&s;e was before they were up, or at lea&s;t before they were come out of their Chamber.</P>
<P>My Dear, &s;ays the Husband, you and I have had a &s;ad Breach about our Family Wor&s;hip, and it has been attended with a great deal of Sin on both Sides; is there no Hopes of putting an end to it? 'Tis a &s;ad thing, that &s;eeing we both acknowledge it to be our Duty, we &s;hould fall out about the Manner of do|ing it!</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>All &s;uch Breaches are be&s;t ended by them who began them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am loth to enter into a new Strife about who began the old; I had rather enter into Mea&s;ures of Peace for putting an End to it on both Sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no Hand in it; do not think to ex|cu&s;e your Sin by laying it upon your Wife; <HI>as I told you before,</HI> that won't take the Charge off from your &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Dear, I am not excu&s;ing my &s;elf, I have been Guilty of a great Sin in &s;uffering your bad U&s;age of me to be my Snare, and leting your Contempt of my Performance put me upon a Neglect of my Duty; but have you been to blame in Nothing? Have you done all your Duty, and are you &s;ure that all the Fault is mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing I have been to blame in, but in telling you what is true enough, that your praying in your Family is, to me, a Piece of cold in|&s;ignificant Stuff; I look upon you as one of them who&s;e Prayer is an Abomination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is calling me a wicked Man in the fir&s;t Place; and yet even &s;uch are commanded to <HI>repent,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="62">
<HI>to pray, to turn to GOD, and to call upon him;</HI> you do not argue I hope that becau&s;e you e&s;teem me &s;o much wor&s;e than your &s;elf, that therefore I mu&s;t not pray to GOD, nor take care to have religious Wor|&s;hip kept up in my Family? to do that, is the way to have our Children wor&s;e than any of us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll take Care of my Children; they &s;han't be the wor&s;e for your Example, if I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I que&s;tion whether that would be in your Power, if my Example were really bad, as I hope it is not; however, I hope in praying for them and with them, I can do them no harm, there is no bad Example in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may do as you plea&s;e; your Prayers are of no U&s;e to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, my Dear, le&s;t &s;ome time or o|ther you come into a Condition to de&s;ire, nay perhaps to want the Prayers of every one that will but pity you enough to pray for you.</P>

<P>That's none of your Bu&s;ine&s;s, I don't ask your Prayers now you &s;ee; you may &s;tay till I do.</P>

<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll pray that GOD will be plea&s;ed to give you a better Mind.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may as well let it alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Temper is perfectly void of Charity; and you act as if you de&s;ir'd the Wor&s;hip of GOD &s;hould be wholly neglected, or wholly drop'd in the Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I look upon that and your performing it to be much at one; if it were otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould do as becomes me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you would do as becomes you now, and not di&s;courage the Work of GOD; how if GOD &s;hould accept, my imperfect Petitions, I am &s;ure you are not a Judge of the Sincerity of the Heart? And if he that knows the Heart &s;hould ac|cept what you &s;o much de&s;pi&s;e, you will then be
<PB N="54" REF="63">
found a Fighter again&s;t GOD? I intreat you to con|&s;ider your Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't want to be taught my Duty by you, that do not under&s;tand your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you &s;ay I do not under&s;tand my Duty, when I now tell you with Grief, my Sen&s;e of having omitted it, and my De&s;ire to return to the Di&s;charge of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what is it you pretend to de&s;ire of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My De&s;ire is, that you would concur in the Exerci&s;e of our Morning and Evening Sacrifice, that we may join together in praying for the Pardon of our Family Sins, and for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon us and our Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you my Rea&s;ons why I cannot join with you; I do not look upon your Performance to be call'd Praying, becau&s;e I do not &s;ee that your Lips and your Heart go together; or that your Life con|forms to the Holine&s;s of your &s;eeming Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Dear, mu&s;t none pray but tho&s;e that have no Infirmities to be laid to their Charge? And pray, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> Who made you a Judge of the Sincerity of the Heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what is all this Di&s;cour&s;e for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Dear, I would fain re&s;tore the Face of Religion in my Family, which our la&s;t Di&s;|pute has made a dreadful Breach in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and &s;o you would &s;et up your hypo|critical Formalities again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very unchri&s;tian, very unkind, and very di&s;couraging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>B&V;T,</HI> may be very ju&s;t for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>NO,</HI> nor is it ju&s;t: <HI>But however,</HI> &s;ince you are &s;o rude to me, and in a thing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and which I cannot, I dare not any longer omit; I tell you I am re&s;olv'd to do my Duty, do you what you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="64">
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what need was there of this Di&s;cour&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I would fain have had your Con|currence and your Countenance in it; which it is your Duty to give to &s;uch a Work among your Chil|dren and Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think any of the Children like it any more than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>To you, my Dear, I'll offer no Force of any kind; but as for my Children, I &s;hall expect their Attendance, and will take care to make them comply with it, whether they like it or not; that's another Que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe they will all be Di&s;&s;enters; I hope you will give them Liberty of Con&s;cience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Liberty of Con&s;cience relates to different Ways of Wor&s;hip, but is not concern'd in the Di&s;pute between Wor&s;hip in general, and no Wor&s;hip at all; there's no Toleration to be an Arhei&s;t, to deny GOD or abandon Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they may pray by them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll oblige them to give their Attendance to Family Orders; I am &s;ure it is their Duty; they may pray by them&s;elves at other Times, and I hope they will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they don't think it their Duty, it is Per&s;e|cution and Tyranny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Family Wor&s;hip is an undoubted Duty, if they don't think &s;o, it is time they were taught better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps they do wor&s;hip in the Family with|out you, and more to their Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let them wor&s;hip GOD as often as they will, I hinder none; but at my &s;tated Times I &s;hall expect them; their wor&s;hiping in the Family without me, is not Family Wor&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will let you &s;ee plainly enough then, that it is a Force upon their Inclinations, and perhaps &s;ometimes in a Manner which you will not like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="56" REF="65">
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what your Example may have encourag'd them to; however; as it is their Duty to do otherwi&s;e, if they fail in their Duty, I &s;hall find means to teach them better Manners: And as for your &s;elf, &s;eeing you oblige me to force my way thus to that, which as a kind Wife, you ought to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in, and as a good Chri&s;tian, you ought to have encourag'd in your Family, I &s;hall be be&s;t plea&s;ed if you will prevent the Di&s;couragement I have formerly met with from you, by withdraw|ing your &s;elf, till you can with Charity and Decency join with me; and in the mean time I'll pray for you, that GOD will reconcile you better to what I am &s;o well a&s;&s;ur'd is your Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I believe you will be &s;ooner gratify'd by me than by your Daughters.</P>

<P>The good Man was exceedingly afflicted with this Ob&s;tinacy of his Wife, and the more, becau&s;e he look'd upon it to be incurable: However, being re|&s;olv'd to do his Duty, he takes his little Boy in his Hand and goes down Stairs; and after &s;ome time, call'd for his two elde&s;t Daughters, who came down Stairs al&s;o to him: Upon this he calls his Servants into his Parlour, and cau&s;ing his elde&s;t Son to read a Chapter, had fa&s;ten'd the Door and went to Prayer with them.</P>
<P>During his Performance, he had the Di&s;turbance to hear his Wife come down Stairs and offer to open the Door, but finding it fa&s;t to retire and go up again.</P>
<P>At Night, he re&s;olv'd to do the &s;ame, but before the u&s;ual Hour; and that his Wife might not prevent his Childrens Attendance, he call'd his elde&s;t Daugh|ter, of about 17 Years old, to him, and begun to di&s;cour&s;e a little with her of the Nature of Prayer; which occa&s;ion'd the following Dialogue, his &s;econd Daughter being al&s;o by.</P>

After which, that his Wife might not pretend to interfere with him as to Time, he re&s;olv'd, if he could bring her to any thing, to make Terms with her about the Time of her &s;e|perate Performance: Be&s;ides, as the Child had in the Di&s;cour&s;e above, entirely contradicted what his Wife had &s;ugge&s;ted about her Aver&s;ion to his Performance, he re&s;olv'd to talk with her about that too.</P>

<P>His Wife went away in a great Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid &s;ome things to him at parting which I care not to mention, and which grieved the good Man extream|ly; but he made her no Reply.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Man went on with his Fa|mily
<PB N="66" REF="75">
Order, and had the Wor&s;hip of GOD, as Reading the Scriptures, &s;inging P&s;alms, and Prayer, regularly and con&s;tantly perform'd; his Children at|tended con&s;tantly and chearfully; but his Wife never.</P>
<P>It had indeed been &s;ome Trouble to his Mind, that for &s;ome time after the Breach above-mention'd, he had &s;hut the Door of his Parlour when he went to Prayers; which he had not only done to keep his Wife out, but had told her too, <HI>as before;</HI> and &s;he had twice, or three times, come down to the Door, and finding it lock'd, went back again.</P>
<P>He had found her &s;o Pa&s;&s;ionate, and &s;o fill'd with Contempt of his Performance, that it was his real Belief her De&s;ign was at fir&s;t to give him &s;ome Di|&s;turbance, to behave with &s;ome Indecency, or at lea&s;t to take hold of &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ion of his, more unguarded perhaps than ordinary, to upbraid him with, and perhaps to make a Mock of among the Children, as &s;he had done once or twice before; and therefore thought it better to have her ab&s;ent, at lea&s;t till &s;he was come to a better Temper. But after &s;ome time, and finding her, as I &s;aid, come two or three times down to the Door, he began to con&s;ider, <HI>that</HI> it was not for him to judge of what Temper &s;he came in; <HI>that</HI> to &s;hut her out was not only unkind, but was depriving her of an Opportunity of being convinc'd; that perhaps when &s;he might come with a De&s;ign to &s;coff at or in&s;ult him, GOD might di|rect &s;omething to touch her Thoughts, that might turn her Affections to him, and remove her Pride and want of Charity all at once, and &s;o make the very Thing that &s;he had de&s;pi&s;ed, be the Means of her Reformation: And as the&s;e were Things which above every thing el&s;e he de&s;ired, he was exceedingly trou|bled that he had &s;hut the Door.</P>
<P>If he was concern'd on the&s;e Accounts, and upon
<PB N="67" REF="76">
Debates only with him&s;elf, that Concern was exceed|ingly encrea&s;ed, when he under&s;tood by his Daugh|ter, that the la&s;t time her Mother came down and found the Door fa&s;t, &s;he had been crying vehemently in her Chamber for &s;ome Hours after; this mov'd him exceedingly: for he was a very kind and ten|der Husband to her, and he re&s;olved never to fa&s;ten the Door again, and order'd his Daughter to let her Mother know the Door was never lock'd, but always left a little open, even without the Latch being touch'd: However, his Wife never offer'd to come down after the Door was left open.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily believ'd, that while this Breach continued in religious Things, the Family Peace, as to common Affairs, went all to wreck; the Counte|nances of Husband and Wife were perfectly chang'd to one another; no Smiles, no plea&s;ant Word, no kind Thing pa&s;s'd between them; but a Cloud of Melan|cholly and Di&s;content, and an Air of E&s;trangement &s;pread it &s;elf over the whole Family; every little Di&s;pute broke out into a Feud, every Feud was car|ried on to the extreame&s;t height; and, in a word, there was very little room, if any, for the poor Re|mains of conjugal Affection to &s;hew it &s;elf: So cer|tain is it, that where the religious Peace is broken, no other Peace can long continue.</P>
<P>This afflicted the Husband's Mind to the la&s;t De|gree; and not the Wife only, but all the Family per|ceived it. As to his Wife, &s;he kept it more to her &s;elf, and continued to carry it with an un&s;ociable haughtine&s;s of Temper; if he offer'd to &s;peak of it, &s;he would always put a &s;hort End to the Di&s;cour&s;e; tell him, &s;he had nothing to &s;ay to him; or flying a|way from him, or perhaps &s;ay &s;ome very pa&s;&s;ionate thing that put an End to it; &s;o that &s;he would never enter into any Di&s;cour&s;e with him; &s;he &s;eemed to live altogether in her Chamber retir'd from all Com
<PB N="68" REF="77">
pany, and came down into her Family, as if it were with Reluctance; and more by the Nece&s;&s;ity of or|dering her Servants and Hou&s;hold-Affairs, than by Choice, or from any Plea&s;ure &s;he took among them; and as this had not only continued a long time, but &s;eemed to have no vi&s;ible Pro&s;pect of any Alterati|on, it gave her. Husband a mo&s;t un&s;ufferable Af|fliction.</P>
<P>But alas! the good Man's Affliction was far from ending there, and the Tragical Part of the Family is yet behind.</P>
<P>I could have been very glad to have brought this poor weak, but proud Woman upon the Stage, as a Penitent, acknowledging her Mi&s;take in Duty, for mi&s;u&s;ing her Husband; and her Mi&s;take in Religi|on, for de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;incere humble Performance of her Husband in Matters of Duty in his Family; and for ob&s;tructing that, <HI>for want of Charity,</HI> which every &s;ober Chri&s;tian would rejoice in <HI>(viz.)</HI> to &s;ee GOD &s;erv'd, honour'd and wor&s;hip'd in their Family, and their Children brought up in the con&s;tant Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e religious Duties, which their natural Ho|mage to their Maker calls for.</P>
<P>But the Truth of this Hi&s;tory forbids, and I mu&s;t be forced to record this unhappy Wife as a &s;ad <HI>Mo|mento</HI> again&s;t &s;piritual or religious Pride, and to be an Evidence of the exceeding Difficulty of re&s;toring a Phari&s;aical Hypocrite to Repentance.</P>
<P>The Man's Affliction, as I have &s;aid, was vi&s;ible; but yet he had &s;ome Comfort within him&s;elf, parti|cularly, that he was in the Way of his Duty; and the Satisfaction he had in his recovering from that wicked Step he had at fir&s;t taken, of neglecting his Family, and throwing up the Practice of what he knew to be his Duty, was a very great and con&s;tant Support to him.</P>
<P>He had al&s;o the Satisfaction to &s;ee, that all his
<PB N="69" REF="78">
Children joined with him heartily, and &s;eemed to re|joice in the Mea&s;ures he had taken for the Order and Regularity of the Hou&s;e; and the elde&s;t Daughter, a good &s;ober, and well-enclin'd Child, would often &s;ay to him, Dear Father, per&s;wade my Mother to come down to Prayers.</P>
<P>He would be very cautious of &s;aying any thing to the Child that &s;eem'd to reflect on her Mother; but one Day the Child &s;aying &s;o to him, he an&s;wered; My Dear, I am very &s;orry your Mother does not come down, do you per&s;wade her to it, I &s;hould be very glad to have her come.</P>
<P><HI>Said the Daughter,</HI> &s;hall I go and tell her you &s;ent me to de&s;ire her to come?</P>
<P>Ay do, my Dear, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> with all my Heart.</P>
<P>The Child went, and when her Father ask'd her what her Mother &s;aid, &s;he could not an&s;wer him, but broke out into Tears; her Father under&s;tood it.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>&s;aid her Father,</HI> don't let it trou|ble thee, I &s;ee how it is, we mu&s;t wait GOD's time.</P>
<P>He fail'd not to take all Opportunities to &s;peak to her him&s;elf after this; but found his Wife, as he thought, had taken a new Method; for as before &s;he would always an&s;wer him with &s;omething very ill|natur'd and unkind, &s;o now tho' &s;he were ever &s;o free in Di&s;cour&s;e of other Things, when ever he be|gan to &s;peak of this Affair, &s;he would not an&s;wer one Word.</P>
<P>The&s;e things continued about three Quarters of a Year, and far from abating by length of Time, as Family Heats between Husband and Wife ordinarily do; on the contrary, they took Root like a &s;trong Di|&s;temper, by the Length of their Duration.</P>
<P>At length his Wife was taken Ill; the Man was exceedingly afflicted at his Wife's Sickne&s;s, and e|&s;pecially as he &s;aw &s;ome Danger of Death; and it almo&s;t di&s;tracted his Thoughts to think &s;he &s;hould die
<PB N="70" REF="79">
without being reconciled to him; her Di&s;temper at fir&s;t appeared a kind of a Lethargick Fever, which, as it prey'd upon her Spirits one way, and brought her very low, &s;o it kept her dozing, and uncapable to be talk'd with, another way.</P>
<P>He often attempted to &s;peak to her. but found &s;he would not an&s;wer a Word; or if &s;he did, it was either to de&s;ire him not to trouble her, or &s;omething quite remote from what he &s;aid; by which he found that &s;he was too much &s;tupify'd by the Di&s;temper to talk, and unwilling to di&s;cour&s;e when &s;he was other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Di&s;temper however in about three Weeks time abated, and &s;he began to get Strength, but no Life came into her Temper, no Chearfulne&s;s into her Spirits; but a deep Melancholy &s;eemed to &s;ucceed the Fever; and one Morning the Phy&s;ician that at|tended her came to her Husband, and ask'd him if he knew any extraordinary Trouble &s;he had upon her Spirits? Her Husband &s;aid no, no extraordinary one; But why do you ask me that Que&s;tion, &s;ays he with great Concern? Why, &s;ays the Doctor, becau&s;e I fear &s;he has a little Spice of Di&s;order in her Head, and if we do not prevent it, &s;he will be in danger of a confirm'd Melancholy.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Concern this put him in, and he began to enter into a &s;erious Con&s;ultation with the Doctor, who had &s;poke cantiou&s;ly, becau&s;e he would not &s;urprize him; but the Apothecary came down immediately after, and with le&s;s Prudence &s;aid aloud to the Doctor, who ask'd how &s;he did? <HI>Do,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>why &s;he is mad, quite di&s;tracted, we mu&s;t get &s;ome Help immediately to tie her in the Bed.</HI></P>
<P>Her Husband, who had by the Prudence of the Doctor entertained only an Apprehen&s;ion of the Dan|ger of &s;uch a thing as remote, and po&s;&s;ible to be pre|vented,

<P>The Phy&s;ician being at Hand, they were not &s;o much at a Lo&s;s for applying proper Remedies; but it was &s;o long e'er they recovered him, that the Doctor him&s;elf was once of the Opinion that he was dead, and was going out of the Room; but &s;ome Signs of Life appearing &s;oon after, they went on with their Applications, and opening a Vein, the Blood flowing, recovered him to Life, but left him very ill, which was followed by a Fever, and that threw him into the Small-Pox, which it &s;eems he had not had, and from which he did not recover without great Danger of his Life.</P>
<P>There was a &s;ad Family we may be &s;ure, while the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Family remained in the&s;e Circum&s;tances: But however, the Husband recovered with the help of Time; but the Wife grew wor&s;e, till he was obliged to have her removed out of the Hou&s;e for a Time; and as it is allowed that a melancholy Lunacy is the harde&s;t to cure, &s;o indeed they found it here, for &s;he lay above a Year under the Hands of the Phy&s;ician, without much Appearance of Alteration, except at Intervals, &s;carce knowing, or at lea&s;t not noticing her own Children or Husband.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;ervable, that during her Di&s;temper, &s;he was always reading the Bible and religious Books, but would never talk with any Body otherwi&s;e than of common Things; and during the whole Time, was never heard &s;o much as once to mention the Breach with her Husband; and when &s;he was thought well enough to go home again, it appeared &s;he had forgot it as perfectly as if &s;he had never known any thing of it; nor had &s;he forgotten that only, but even her Family and common Things, her Husband having removed to another Dwelling; &s;he
<PB N="72" REF="81">
did not &s;o much as know that it was not the &s;ame Hou&s;e &s;he had lived in before; &s;he knew her Husband and Children indeed, but did not know any of the Servants; no, not enough to di&s;tingui&s;h who had been before her Illne&s;s, or who had come after.</P>
<P>This filled her Husband with dreadful Apprehen|&s;ions that her Di&s;temper was not removed; but as he communicated his Fears to the Phy&s;ician, he &s;aid it was a &s;ign that it would entirely remove at la&s;t; but &s;he continued a long time in but a very indiffe|rent Condition, much altered in her Temper, and often &s;ubject to little Returns of Melancholy; but in her Family &s;he liv'd orderly, and kept in a very good Di&s;po&s;ition, as to the religious Part; and if &s;he had any Remembrances of the Breach that had been car|ried on, &s;he kept it to her &s;elf, for &s;he never would di&s;cover that &s;he received any Notion of it in her Thoughts; &s;he attended Duly on the Orders of the Family, appeared very &s;erious at the Times of Wor|&s;hip, and never offered to di&s;like or reflect upon, much le&s;s to mock or &s;coff at her Husband's Perform|ance in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Her Children were warn'd by their Father, never to endeavour to put her in mind of former Differen|ces; no, not &s;o much as in Curio&s;ity to try whether &s;he really remembered any thing or not; which Or|ders they very punctually ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It was not long after this, when the Country Gen|tleman, who&s;e Story makes a Part in the former Dia|logue, came to Town; and as their Ca&s;es were &s;o exactly alike when they had la&s;t di&s;cour&s;ed upon the Subject of their Family Circum&s;tances, &s;o they had kept up a con&s;tant Corre&s;pondence by Letters; but now at their meeting they enter into Particulars more at large; which as near as po&s;&s;ible is continued in the following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>His Friend li&s;ten'd to the Relation with great At|tention, and was particularly plea&s;ed with the Suc|ce&s;s he had in that Part about his Children; but was extreamly affected with the Tragical Part of it in his Wife, which indeed brought Tears into his Eyes; and the more, from the Sence he had on him, how much more comfortable an I&s;&s;ue he had had on his own Side.</P>

<P>That is true, but it would have been a greater Comfort to me to have known that &s;he had been made truly &s;en&s;ible of the Sin of her former Conduct, that &s;he had repented heartily of it, and that &s;he had received Comfort in the Hope of Forgivene&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s that is a thing that you may think wanting, but you cannot judge her not to have been a Penitent, becau&s;e you cannot tell what Intervals for Conviction &s;he might have had, either before, in, or after her Di&s;traction.</P>

<P>I have &s;eriou&s;ly dige&s;ted that Part in my Thoughts; and I'll tell you to what I&s;&s;ue I have brought it: I a&s;&s;ure you the Re&s;ult is no Abatement of my Trouble in the Ca&s;e of my Wife; no, not in the lea&s;t, but rather an Increa&s;e of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let me hear your Opinion in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; I cannot think GOD will lay to our Charge the Sins committed in a di&s;tracted Condition, when the Body is demented, and has not the U&s;e of Rea&s;on to guide it; when Con&s;cience is put out of its Office, and can neither accu&s;e or excu&s;e; when the Soul is no more a Free Agent, and the Creature is reduced to the meer &s;en&s;ative Life.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mi&s;take me quite, I am not arguing on that Part, and perhaps I may incline to think as you do, with re&s;pect to what is done during the Power of Lunacy; but what will you &s;ay to the Sins of Life committed before that Di&s;traction, and which the Di&s;temper coming ha&s;tily upon her, &s;he had no Time to reflect upon or repent of? Pray what is the
<PB N="75" REF="84">
Difference between &s;uch a Condition, and one dying without Repentance? I look upon my Wife as one dead, for while the Soul is di&s;abled in its Operations, &s;he is dead to all tho&s;e Things which are nece&s;&s;ary to a true Penitent; &s;uch as Sorrow for the Sin, Ab|horrence of the Evil of it, asking Pardon of GOD, acting Faith on the Blood of CHRIST for Remi&s;|&s;ion, Re&s;olutions to reform, and the like; the&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould have any Part in, and therefore &s;he &s;eems to me to be ju&s;t in the &s;ame State as one dying impenitent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You have a little &s;urprized me indeed, in giv|ing that Turn to it, which I did not think of before; and I mu&s;t acknowledge that I am of your Opinion in the thing it &s;elf; only that in the Ca&s;e of your Wife, there is room for Hope to you, in two Parti|culars: 1. That, as before, you are not &s;ure that &s;he had no Intervals, in which GOD might &s;peak to her Soul, and her Soul fly to and embrace her Saviour with effectual Relentings, and &s;aving Dependance on him for Salvation; all which might be acted in a Mo|ment, as I doubt not it often is in the very Article of Death; witne&s;s the <HI>Thief upon the Cro&s;s;</HI> and this might much better be in the Time of her Sickne&s;s, tho' the Di&s;traction of her State &s;ince that, may have given her no room to di&s;cover it. 2. And then you have this Comfort, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;he is &s;till alive; and tho' &s;he has given no Te&s;timonies of the remembring the Error of her former Life, to repent of it; &s;he has yet &s;hewn that &s;he has al&s;o no Remembrances of her former Mi&s;takes to renew them, &s;he begins upon a new Scheme of Life, acts quite another Part; and who knows but that in Time GOD may call to her mind her former Evils, and give her Repentance &s;till; &s;o that you have no Rea&s;on either Way to look on her as one lo&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly your Argument, in that Point e&s;pecial|ly
<PB N="76" REF="85">
the la&s;t, has &s;ome Comfort in it, and I am in hope that &s;he may yet be a Penitent, for &s;he has a great &s;tock of religious Knowledge, and I find it re|mains &s;till, the Di&s;temper has not made any Breach of that kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, comfort your &s;elf, and bear up un|der the Affliction, and believe that &s;he &s;hall yet be re&s;tor'd to her Family and Husband; I am &s;ure if I had &s;een half &s;o much room to hope for my profli|gate ignorant Creature, I &s;hould have rejoic'd in it.</P>

<P>Truly nothing, but that which in|deed &s;he ought to be a&s;hamed of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, it is a great Affliction to me, whatever it is to her, to think we &s;hould break up our Family in &s;uch a manner: And I think, if you knew what a Trifle this Quarrel was about, you would &s;ay, we were both mad; &s;he, to go away, and I, to let her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>You let her go! How could you hinder her? If a Woman will run away, who can &s;top her? If &s;he had been mine, &s;he &s;hould have gone I a&s;&s;ure you; and as &s;he had gone when &s;he pleas'd, &s;he &s;hould not come again till I plea&s;ed.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean? would you have yielded up your Religion and Con&s;cience, and turn|ed Arhei&s;t like your Wife; if you could have laid down all that, why did you begin it? Sure you would not have done that for a Wife; you'd have paid dear enough for her I a&s;&s;ure you, and more a great deal than &s;he was worth: If I had half that Religion, and Hone&s;ty that you have, Brother, I would not break into it one inch for the be&s;t Wife in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>You appear by that, Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> to have more Religion and Hone&s;ty too, than many that pre|tend to the highe&s;t Degree of Sanctity in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you don't know me; I am a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is only what you &s;ay of your &s;elf, Sir <HI>Richard;</HI> I think you have a greater Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Things, and more Knowledge of what Religion is, than many that &s;eem to talk very religiou&s;ly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am the very &s;ame <HI>drunken, loo&s;e, profane DEVIL</HI> my Father was before me, and that my Grandfather was before him; we are a helli&s;h Family, Brother, that's the Truth of it; 'tis Pity a good Man &s;hould have the Misfortune to come a|mong us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you could tell me what it is then, for I &s;ee nothing in me that can make me hope any thing for my &s;elf; and that's the rea&s;on I never care to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you &s;omething, Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> that is very particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't flatter me, for I hate &s;mooth|ing and &s;oftning; I am a plain Dealer, and you &s;ee I u&s;e my &s;elf very coar&s;ly, but 'tis all true, therefore don't pretend to flatter me, I &s;ay.</P>

<P>Sir, I flatter no Body; that Plainne&s;s you &s;peak of, is the thing I have hope of you from; you have &s;omething &s;o &s;incere in you, that I cannot but he &s;atisfied it will &s;ome time or other kindle a Fire in your Soul that will flame up to Heaven, and burn up all the Harve&s;t the Devil hopes for in you; Sin|cerity is a Foundation for all that's religious to build upon.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't bear the Thoughts of religious Things long together, they run me into &s;trange Con|vul&s;ions of Mind; and &s;o I run away to Company, and drink off the Chagrin of tho&s;e Things; and when I am once Drunk, the next Morning it is all over, and I am well enough.</P>

<P>No, Sir, I did not mean that; I hope we did not differ &s;o much about that, as to make tho&s;e things the ground of our Separation; if &s;o, I am a Martyr in a better Cau&s;e than I expected.</P>

<P>Why not to &s;eem to regard her, or &s;eek after her, but leave her to come to her &s;elf gradually; I dare &s;ay you will find it all wear off, if you don't follow her; like Children, who fancy them&s;elves not well; do but whine over them, and you really hand them to Bed; and they will at la&s;t be as &s;ick as at fir&s;t they pretended to be; I intreat you be rul'd by Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> let her alone and &s;he will &s;oon change her Mind.</P>

<P>Indeed &s;o have I; and depend upon it, if he is, he will be a very bright Chri&s;tian as well as a very bright Man; he is of an excellent Temper, nicely Hone&s;t, un&s;eignedly Sincere, and wants no|thing that Nature can furni&s;h him with towards a Change. I hope GOD will work upon him in Time, for he will be a Miracle of GOD's Grace, that will &s;et all round him at gaze; &s;uch a Sinner brought to Repentance, would make Joy in Heaven and Joy on Earth at the &s;ame time.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you could not have believ'd &s;uch a thing, of one that you call Si&s;ter; do you think &s;uch Mean|ne&s;s of Spirit is in the Blood of your Family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> we are a hot pa&s;&s;ionate Brood, that is true indeed; but I mu&s;t tell you, for my own Part, my being &s;o violently pa&s;&s;ionate, is one of the Things that I as much hate my &s;elf for, as for any thing I have about me; and I have often thought that one time or other that furious Temper of mine will bring me to ruin; make me commit Murther, or &s;ome Mi&s;chief or other that will make me mi&s;erable all the Days of my Life; and I hearti|ly wi&s;h none of my Relations would give way to their Rage, as I have done, and &s;till do, <HI>GOD for|give me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> I hope you will govern your Temper, for all that, tho' I cannot mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Si&s;ter, you mu&s;t govern your Tem|per too, or el&s;e you may ruin your &s;elf as well as I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I have done that already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, Si&s;ter; I would fain have you think a little, and put an end to this Breach with your Husband; certainly you cannot have had rea&s;on to carry it &s;o far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are you on his Side already? I &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="110">
he has &s;ent &s;ome Body to tell his Tale for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really Si&s;ter; I take the Story from no Body, but from your own Mouth, and ju&s;t as you tell it your &s;elf; and &s;ure you would not tell it to your own Di&s;advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you nothing but what was true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s I doubted it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;hould yo do &s;o, do I u&s;e to &s;peak untrue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No,</HI> Si&s;ter; but really I fancy'd you &s;aid more again&s;t your &s;elf than was your due; for I could not think it was po&s;&s;ible you could differ, and part with your Husband upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion only, as you &s;aid you did; and from &s;uch a Husband too as I think he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> you mu&s;t believe what you plea&s;e, but I did for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you acted about two Degrees wor&s;e than a Madwoman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why &s;o?</HI> I am not in a Condition to go to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> at lea&s;t I do not &s;ee it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Si&s;ter; if &s;uch a Cau&s;e &s;hould come before us at the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions; I mu&s;t own, that as there is no Law to puni&s;h bad Wives, and &s;uch a Ca&s;e as yours is was &s;carce ever heard of be|fore, I &s;hould certainly move my Brother Ju&s;tices to Vote her Lunatick, and commit the Woman to <HI>Bedlam.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would be very unju&s;t then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I think not, Si&s;ter; I hope you do not take my Plainne&s;s-ami&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not I; but I think you are a little Partial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, there you wrong me too; how can I be Partial, when I take the Story as you tell it your &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e you Cen&s;ure me, as if I was in all the Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's becau&s;e I am impartial; nay, 'tis
<PB N="102" REF="111">
a Proof of my being &s;o; for it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed I would give my Opinion again&s;t my own Si&s;ter, if I was not impartial; it is a &s;trong Argument that the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing is again&s;t you, when I am convinc'd of the Fault's being in you, by the very things you &s;ay in your own Vindication.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there may be Faults on both Sides, Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let who&s;e will be the Fault, yours is the Folly; for as a Man cannot put away his Wife, but for the capital Crime of Adultery; &s;he mu&s;t be a great Fool that will put her &s;elf away, when &s;he is guilty of no Fault at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I put my &s;elf away! you mi&s;take me, I re|tire from an unrea&s;onable burthen&s;ome Humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will talk of that afterwards, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> if you will; but I would fain convince you, if you will give me Leave, of one Mi&s;take in your Con|duct, which perhaps you are not &s;en&s;ible of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is this; that as there is no Rule in GOD's Law to direct a Woman, upon what Oc|ca&s;ions &s;he may part from her Husband, the Law of the Man being &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand for both; &s;o there is a manife&s;t Difference between the Ca&s;es; and a Woman cannot part with her Husband, but with a greater Di&s;advantage to her &s;elf, than it is to the Man to put her away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ca&s;e is plain; the Woman's parting from her Husband is ea&s;ier to do, but liable to more Hazards, when done; I'll explain my &s;elf immedi|ately in both: 1. <HI>It is ea&s;ier to do;</HI> if a Woman re|&s;olves to part with her Husband, &s;he has nothing to do but to open the Door and go out; he can neither by Force, nor by Law prevent her, nor fetch her home again: But if the Man re&s;olves to put his Wife
<PB N="103" REF="112">
from him, he can do it no way but by a formal Pro|&s;ecution; if he bids her be gone. &s;he may an&s;wer &s;he won't go; if he forces her out, &s;he may come in again; nay, the Law will force him to take her in, till he has made his turning her out legal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>So then,</HI> you think we have the Advantage; but you Men have Ways enough to be even with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the 2<HI>d,</HI> the Turn is on our &s;ide: As the <HI>Difficulty</HI> is on the <HI>Husband</HI>'s Part, the <HI>Scandal</HI> is on the <HI>Woman's;</HI> for as it is very well known &s;he cannot be forc'd away but for Adultery, &s;o it is pre&s;ently taken for granted &s;he is guilty, if &s;he is gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? tho' &s;he goes by her Choice, not by his Force?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who will know the Particulars, com|par'd to the Number that will know the general; eve|ry Body knows in general <HI>that they are parted,</HI> but not one in fifty will enquire into, or hear of the Me|rits of the Cau&s;e between the Woman and her Hu&s;|band, or ask whether <HI>&s;he went away,</HI> or <HI>he &s;ent her</HI> away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, the Di&s;advantage is of our Side, but what's this to my Ca&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Si&s;ter, it applies very aptly thus, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That then a wi&s;e Woman &s;hould never part from her Husband, but upon the greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, and with the mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;ons in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know but you may be in the right in that; but I don't know that it touches my Ca&s;e; for I do not know that this will be call'd a Parting from my Husband for good and all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not the Time will alter the Crime; no, nor will it remove the Scandal, Si&s;ter, it is that I am arguing upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't know for what Time it may be neither, if he carries it thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how does he carry it? I don't &s;ee he minds you; I find he leaves you to your own Cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="104" REF="113">
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, I am come away, and he troubles not his Head about it, as I &s;ee, nor intends to trou|ble him&s;elf, &s;o we are not likely to come together a|gain in ha&s;te.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trouble him&s;elf! <HI>No indeed,</HI> and <HI>as I hear</HI> he re&s;olves never to trouble his Head about you again, unle&s;s you come home as you ought to do, and as it is your known Duty to do; nor can you blame him, for you acknowledge that you gave him the Occa&s;ion; and I mu&s;t own Si&s;ter, that in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, they who gave the fir&s;t Provocation, ought to make the fir&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you would have me make my Submi&s;&s;ion, would you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nay Si&s;ter,</HI> 'tis nothing to me, I won't take upon me to &s;ay what I would have you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, I a&s;&s;ure you, I'll &s;ubmit to no Body.</P>

<P>Are you &s;ure of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand &s;o by &s;omething that I have &s;een or heard; and I mu&s;t own I cannot blame him, I think I &s;hould do ju&s;t the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you that you were partial; you are &s;o, meerly as <HI>a MAN.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;uppo&s;e that; we have the Laws of GOD on our &s;ide; you are commanded to &s;ubmit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not have you enter upon that Di&s;|cour&s;e, you will claim more for the Men than you you will practi&s;e as a kind Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not talking of what is your Duty as a Wife, for there Si&s;ter you mu&s;t acknowledge you are quite wrong; but I am really concern'd for your own &s;ake, your Intere&s;t, your Ea&s;e, your Reputati|on; I wi&s;h you would think of tho&s;e Things for they are all going to Wreck.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>If every Woman that had a cro&s;s Hu&s;|band, or every Man that had a cro&s;s Wife, &s;hould come away from them, what think you would be|come of the World? be&s;ides, my dear Si&s;ter, &s;hall I ask you a plain Que&s;tion?</P>

<P>I think him &s;o to be &s;ure.</P>
</SP>

<P>Did you ever try to mend his Wife, and to &s;ee if that would not cure him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never told you I was a good Wife.</P>

<P>What do you infer from that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I infer, that he is where he ought to be; and you are where you ought not to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Brother, be plain with me, are you talking from him, and for him, or is it only an acci|dental Di&s;cour&s;e, as I thought it was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Si&s;ter, I will be plain; I have &s;een your Husband, and he has &s;o convinc'd me of your being in the wrong, that I re&s;olv'd for your &s;ake to talk with you, and per&s;uade you to act with more Prudence; you know the&s;e are Things quite out of my Way, but I profe&s;s I think talking with you, and hearing of your Conduct with your Husband, has done more to make me &s;erious, than all the teaching I had in my Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make you &s;erious! you make me &s;mile to hear you talk of being &s;erious, and e&s;pecially at my making you &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Troth Si&s;ter, your Extream of Athei&s;m,
<PB N="106" REF="115">
is enough to make an Infidel religious; why you act as if you believ'd there was neither God or Devil, Hell or Heaven, and that we were to reckon for no|thing in the next World, that we do in this; and tho' Si&s;ter I am a poor wicked, profligate, unthinking Wretch my &s;elf, yet I know I am &s;o, and that I ought to be otherwi&s;e; <HI>B&V;T YO&V;</HI> are wor&s;e than a Heathen in this, that you de&s;pi&s;e being religious, as a thing quite below you; for GOD &s;ake, Si&s;ter, let you and I both think a little what will become of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ble&s;s me! that ever my elde&s;t Brother, the well-known Sir <HI>Richard &mdash;</HI> &s;hould turn Par&s;on! why I never heard &s;uch a Sermon in the Hou&s;e in my Life; you need not have told me you had &s;een my Husband, why if I had heard you talk thus before, I would have &s;worn you had been talking to my Hu&s;|band, and he had been preaching Repentance to you; come, come, Brother, tell me what he &s;ays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;ays, Si&s;ter, what I could never have believ'd; he tells me you are a De&s;pi&s;er of all Reli|gion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what News is that to you? What have I to do with Religion, or you either?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's true, Si&s;ter, I have heard that Wo|men have no Souls; but I never thought you believ'd it till now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hate him, and all his religious Impertinen|ces; you know tho&s;e Things never were reli&s;h'd in our Family.</P>

<P>To our Shame be it &s;poken Si&s;ter.</P>

<P>Not at all! I think 'tis much to our Credit, for then we are &s;ure we have no Hypocrites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Si&s;ter; upon my Word, your Way of talking has been the mo&s;t of a Sermon to me that ever I heard in my Life; you really make my very Blood run chill, and my Joints tremble; it's true, I have not been religious, GOD pardon me, but I
<PB N="107" REF="116">
never thought my &s;elf the better for it, or to be commended for it; there is a great deal of Difference Si&s;ter, between one that practices no religious Part, and one that de&s;pi&s;es Religion it &s;elf; and I doubt that is ju&s;t the Difference between you and I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I don't trouble my &s;elf about Religion, nor do I intend to trouble my &s;elf about it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> you do him Wrong, he is the backwarde&s;t Man alive to &s;peak it of you; but did not you own it to me your &s;elf, when you and I talk'd la&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did I own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly you own'd what I could hardly believe, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That all the Quarrel between you and your Husband, was becau&s;e he is too religious; that he kept up the Wor&s;hip of GOD in the Hou&s;e, and prays, and reads the Bible in the Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and &s;o it was; I had rather behalf hear him &s;ing a Song.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> you a&s;toni&s;h me! I thought there had been nothing wickeder than I in the World; you need not talk of your Husband expo&s;ing you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I do talk of it for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich,</SPEAKER>
<P>But I'll do him &s;o much Ju&s;tice, that he conceals your Folly as much as po&s;&s;ible; nor would he own the Rea&s;on of your leaving him, till I extorted it from him, by telling him that you told me your &s;elf that you left him for nothing, but becau&s;e you could not bear his going to Prayers; tho' indeed <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> I always thought you had je&s;ted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Not I, why &s;hould you think I je&s;ted? Did you think I would come away from my Husband in Je&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="108" REF="117">
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I thought it was impo&s;&s;ible any Woman in <HI>Earne&s;t,</HI> could leave a Husband upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, much le&s;s own it when &s;he had done; and when I mentioned it to your Husband, he would have per&s;uaded me that it was &s;ome other thing you had taken ill from him, and that he hoped &s;ome time or other you would forget it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Truly Si&s;ter, I cannot repeat what you have &s;aid; but you have expo&s;ed the Folly and Bru|tality of an irreligious Conver&s;ation &s;o much by your practi&s;ing it, that I re&s;olve from this Time to amend my Life, and change my whole Practice, Society, and Conver&s;ation: GOD forgive me what is pa&s;t; and if he will give me Grace to follow my Re&s;olu|tions, I will be quite another Man than ever you knew me.</P>

<P>Why, is there no Duty of his Side?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> there is; but he is not out of his Duty, the Scripture and the Marriage Con|tract obliges him to love his Wife, and provide for his Wife; but I confe&s;s I do not find that it obliges him, when &s;he runs-away from him, to run after her, to per&s;wade her to come Home again; e&s;pecially when he has given no ju&s;t Rea&s;on for her Elopement.</P>

<P>Why, Si&s;ter, I will tell you &s;o far what he &s;ays; tho' I a&s;&s;ure you I am not commi&s;&s;ion'd from him to tell it you, or meddle with it; he &s;ays, you are gone from him, he has not put you from him; that he is at Home in his Family, which is his Place, and his Duty; that he gave you no Provocation to
<PB N="110" REF="119">
go away, and that his Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to force you back; that his Doors and his Arms are always open to receive you, if you plea&s;e to return to your Fa|mily, and to your Habitation; that if not, he &s;ub|mits to it as an Affliction, but that he can do no more, or concern him&s;elf no farther in it; and in|deed, Si&s;ter, what can he do more? I am amaz'd at you!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he will do &s;omething more before I go Home to him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;ays, he will do any thing in the World that he can do, which is not incon&s;i&s;tent with his Con&s;cience and his Duty, in order to engage your Affections to him; but upon my Word, Si&s;ter, if you in&s;i&s;t upon his breaking off his religious Govern|ment of his Family, you cannot expect it of him: <HI>Why,</HI> it would be Per&s;ecution, and he ought to die a Martyr, rather than comply with it.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay you have done; while you con|tinue in a &s;eparate Condition from him, and that on Account of his Family Orders; is not that pre&s;&s;ing him in the mo&s;t forcible manner that you are able to do, to lay them down? and if he has any Affecti|on to you, and any De&s;ire to have your Company, as no doubt he has, is it not laying a &s;trong Tempta|tion before him to throw off tho&s;e things to oblige you? I believe you cannot &s;ay, but he has been a very tender obliging Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I can't &s;ay but he was well enough till the&s;e cur&s;ed Quarrels about Religion begun; I know no good &s;uch things do in Families, but to breed Contention.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Si&s;ter, if I may take the Story from your own Mouth, you acknowledg'd to me that he broke from you but for a Quarter of an Hour, to go down to pray with his Family, the Servants being call'd together, and &s;taying for him: Now this is the main Point again; <HI>He believes</HI> it is his Duty, <HI>you would</HI> have him omit it; his Con&s;cience tells him, <HI>he mu&s;t not</HI> o|mit it; his Wife &s;ays, he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> omit it to oblige her: In this ca&s;e, I think I mu&s;t quote &s;ome Scripture too, <HI>Whether it is meet for a Man to obey GOD rather than his Wife, judge you?</HI></P>

<P>He might have oblig'd me for once, it had not been &s;uch a Matter.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Si&s;ter, you and I have made a &s;mall matter of Con&s;cience; but with Men of Principles and of Re|ligion it is quite otherwi&s;e; and I frankly acknow|ledge to you, they are in the right, and we are dread|fully
<PB N="115" REF="124">
mi&s;taken. I &s;ee it plainly now, Si&s;ter; very plainly; a Man once touch'd with a Sen&s;e of his Duty to his Maker, will, like <HI>Daniel,</HI> die rather than omit it: But you could not &s;ee into the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e things, and therefore took it unkindly of him; another Wife would have embrac'd, and lov'd him for it.</P>

<SP>

<P>But, Si&s;ter; do you really think that the little Unkindne&s;s you complain of, had it been real and unju&s;tifiable in him, ju&s;tifies your parting and &s;e|parating from your Husband? can your an&s;wer it to GOD or Man?</P>

<P>It ju&s;tifies it to me and that's enough; I am accountable to no Body.</P>
</SP>

<P>I differ there from you too&mdash;You will find you are accountable to &s;ome Body: But to let that pa&s;s, it cannot ju&s;tify it to your &s;elf, becau&s;e 'tis a Breach of your Obligation, without an Offence.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it no Offence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>It puts me in mind, Si&s;ter, of what I have often ob&s;erv'd in many Families, tho' I never expected to &s;ee an Example of it &s;o near home; that indeed mo&s;t of the Family Breaches in the World, are begun in the verie&s;t Trifles, the mo&s;t ridiculous, &s;imple, in&s;ignificant Differences imaginable: Don't you remember our Neighbour, Mr. <HI>Bar&mdash;t;</HI> his Father, old Ju&s;tice <HI>Bar&mdash;t,</HI> parted from his Wife, Mr. <HI>Bar&mdash;t</HI>'s Mother, about 20 Year before he dy'd, upon a Quarrel between them upon this fooli&s;h Que&s;tion; Whether &s;he would not lead him about if he &s;hould be blind, when he was an old Man? <HI>She &s;aid,</HI> &s;he would not: And, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> 'twas unkind. <HI>She &s;aid,</HI> 'twas Work for a Servant. And, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he
<PB N="116" REF="125">
did not love him; for if &s;he did, &s;he wou'd not tru&s;t him to a Servant. And &s;o one Word brought in an|other, the Devil blowing the Coals, till the Fire of Contention flam'd out: He &s;truck her in a Rage: She threw &s;omething at him in the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion; and he growing furious, Curs'd her; and falling on his Knees, wi&s;h'd &s;omething very terrible to him&s;elf if he liv'd another Day with her; &s;he lifts up her Hands and her Eyes and &s;ays, <HI>AMEN</HI> to it: and &s;o they parted.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll put you in mind of it then, Si&s;ter; the poor old Lady was a good quiet minded Crea|ture, and repented heartily of her Pa&s;&s;ion, tho' &s;he was not the Cau&s;e of the Quarrel; however, &s;he came to him and acknowledg'd her Fault, and beg'd his Pardon, and told him, &s;he was ready to do it on her Knees: That &s;he would come and live with him whenever he de&s;ir'd it, but was afraid to pre&s;s him to it, becau&s;e of the Imprecations he had made upon him&s;elf. At la&s;t &s;he dyed, and made a very penitent Chri&s;tian End, warning all that &s;hould hear of her, to beware of rai&s;ing Feuds in their Families upon &s;light Occa&s;ions. The old Man had &s;tood it out again&s;t GOD and Man till then; but hearing of his Wife's Death, and the Manner of it, went mad, and in one of his Fits, de&s;troyed him&s;elf.</P>

<P>What's all this to me?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what it is to you; 'tis a fair Warning, and indeed an Exhortation to you, not to lay a Foundation of ruining your Family, for &s;uch little Quarrels, &s;uch unju&s;tifiable Things. I was but

a little Boy when old Ju&s;tice <HI>Bar&mdash;t</HI> hang'd him|&s;elf, but I remember the People u&s;ed to &s;ay, it was a ju&s;t Judgment of GOD upon him, for the treating his Wife in &s;uch a barbarous manner for &s;uch a fooli&s;h thing, that had nothing of Provocation in it; and I think yours is really wor&s;e. Here you are parted with your Husband, and have left your Family (and in Confu&s;ion enough to be &s;ure) and all becau&s;e he &s;tay'd a Quarter of an Hour away from you, when you de&s;ir'd his Company; and this without allowing for the Nece&s;&s;ity he was under, in Point of Con&s;ci|ence, to deny you that Quarter of an Hour: Without allowing for its being his Duty to go; and which is more, without con&s;idering, that it was your Duty to have gone with him.</P>

<P>Do, Si&s;ter; but remember, you will not be &s;o well able to bear your own Reproaches, when your Con&s;cience, perhaps very late, &s;hall come to tell you what you ought to have done; how you ruin'd your &s;elf, your Family, your two innocent Children, and your Husband; and for what a &s;ordid Notion your Pa&s;&s;ions, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Devil, carry'd you on to &s;uch a dreadful Extremity: I entreat you, Si&s;ter, con|&s;ider it, and remember, that tho' I have gone but a little way in my Reflections, <HI>I hope they &s;hall encrea&s;e;</HI> yet 'tis the Angui&s;h of my very Soul, that I have &s;old my &s;elf, as it were, to the Devil, for the mo&s;t empty un&s;atisfying Things called <HI>Plea&s;ures,</HI> that can be imagin'd, and that in them&s;elves cannot bear the Name of Plea&s;ures: That to gratify the Madne&s;s of Youth I have given a full Swing to every Appetite, an unre&s;train'd Liberty to every Pa&s;&s;ion, and a Loo&s;e to the wicked Gu&s;t of an unbridled perver&s;e Inclina|tion: If you were able to know, how loath&s;ome the&s;e things look now, when I hope my Judgment is a little at Liberty to di&s;cern better, you would &s;ee nothing in all the Plea&s;ure of Life, but Madne&s;s, Folly, and a making &s;ad Work for Repentance: And let me add, Si&s;ter, that 'tis my Opinion, that this is a great part of the un&s;ufferable Torments of Hell, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that they &s;ee with dreadful Self-Reproaches,

<P>The Si&s;ter was partly provok'd and partly affect|ed with this &s;urprizing Di&s;cour&s;e of her Brother; and falling out into Tears, their Di&s;cour&s;e ended, and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> went away, going &s;oon after to find her Husband, with whom he hop'd to have a long Di&s;cour&s;e, relating both to his Si&s;ter and to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But he was di&s;appointed; for when he came to her Husband's Hou&s;e, he was ju&s;t gone away for <HI>Lon|don.</HI> Sir <HI>Richard</HI> was &s;o di&s;turb'd at his being gone, that he could hardly be per&s;waded from riding after him; but the Servant a&s;&s;ur'd him it would be impo&s;|&s;ible to overtake him, &s;o he gave it over.</P>
<P>The Servant wrote an Account of it to his Ma&s;ter, as is related in the former Dialogue; and that Circum|&s;tance added to his eager De&s;ire of coming Home, not doubting but &s;omething extraordinary had hap|pen'd about his Wife; and it was happy enough that he had the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, on account of what fell out afterward, and which &s;hall be related in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s was of another kind; we have &s;een what Di&s;cour&s;e he had been engag'd in with his Si&s;ter; the &s;erious and kind Arguings he made u&s;e of to move her to a Sen&s;e of her Duty to her Husband, to her Family, and indeed to her &s;elf; and e&s;pecially what An&s;wers &s;he gave him: How profane, even bla&s;phemous; but particularly, ta&s;ting of a Mind perfectly de&s;titute of the Knowledge of good Things, and of any De&s;ire to be in&s;tructed; contemning GOD, Religion, Duty, the Wor&s;hip of GOD, or the common Regard to his Commands.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="129">
Sir <HI>Richard</HI> was a Man as void of Religion as cou'd well be &s;uppos'd of any Man bred up in a Chri&s;tian Country: He was a drunken, &s;wearing, ranting Gentleman; a Man of Plea&s;ure; kept his Hounds and Hor&s;es, lov'd his Sport and his Bottle, and had his Companions for the Purpo&s;e; drank hard, kept great Company; and, in a word, &s;wam down the common Stream of Vice, as a Man that never look'd behind him. As to Religion, he us'd to &s;ay, he had as much as a Gentleman of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year had Oc|ca&s;ion for; he knew very little of it, and minded it le&s;s; nor was there the lea&s;t Concern about &s;uch Things to be &s;een in the Family.</P>
<P>But otherwi&s;e, he was a Man of a clear Head; under&s;tood the World and him&s;elf perfectly well; was, as is &s;aid before, of an excellent Temper, ea&s;ily rea&s;on'd into or out of any thing; very &s;incere, and without any ill Meaning to his Neighbours; benefi|cent to his Tenants; compa&s;&s;ionate to all; and cha|ritable, not from a Principle of Religion, but of meer good Nature.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t he took Notice of this Breach between his Si&s;ter and her Husband, he was extreamly con|cern'd to make it up: But when he come to know the Rea&s;on of it, he was extreamly &s;urpriz'd; his Rea&s;on dictated, that the Husband was in the right, that GOD was to be wor&s;hip'd: and he was a|&s;toni&s;h'd, that a Woman &s;hould make it a Crime, or a Thing to di&s;like any Man for: Devolving tho&s;e Things in his Mind, and being by the natural Con&s;e|quence of the Convictions which were offer'd by his Rea&s;on, led to take Part with her Husband; that Con&s;equence came back upon him&s;elf, and brought the Conviction clo&s;er to his own Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Immediately after he came out of his Si&s;ter's Chamber therefore, he went into his own Parlour, where mu&s;ing a while upon what they had been talk|ing
<PB N="121" REF="130">
of; Well, &s;ays he, it's plain my Brother is right, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> good Man, and my Si&s;ter is a Brute to u&s;e h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> thus for doing what every Body mu&s;t own is <HI>HIS D&V;TY</HI> to do. While he revolv'd the Ca&s;e thus in his Mind, the word <HI>D&V;TY</HI> &s;eem'd to bear a kind of Empha&s;is in it more than ordinary, and hung upon his Lips. She is a Brute, &s;ays he to him|&s;elf, for it was his <HI>D&V;TY;</HI> he ought not to omit it to gratify her, for it was his <HI>D&V;TY;</HI> he mu&s;t have acted again&s;t his Con&s;cience if he had done other|wi&s;e, for he knew it was his <HI>D&V;TY.</HI> This followed him &s;o much, and the word <HI>D&V;TY</HI> lay upon his Thoughts &s;o much, that he could think of nothing el&s;e; and &s;ometime after, taking a Walk in his Gar|den, he began to talk to him&s;elf thus.</P>
<P><HI>Let me &s;ee, I ju&s;tify this Man upon the Foot of this Word D&V;TY;</HI> What is <HI>D&V;TY?</HI> And what <HI>Sence are we to take the Word in, as it is u&s;ed in this Ca&s;e?</HI> Do I under&s;tand it my &s;elf? Then he revolv'd it in his Thoughts farther, thus:</P>
<P><HI>Duty</HI> is a Debt, not of Money to be paid, but of Service to be done.</P>
<P><HI>Duty</HI> is a Homage; 'tis due from a <HI>Va&s;&s;al</HI> to its Lord; a <HI>Subject</HI> to its Sovereign; a <HI>Creature</HI> to its Maker; and indeed from <HI>all Creatures</HI> to their Maker.</P>
<P>He halted there; and with a kind of a Smile, but with ju&s;t Reflection, added; <HI>Now I &s;hall hook my &s;elf in;</HI> I need not enquire much about it; <HI>I am &s;ure I have done</HI> none of my <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have paid</HI> no Homage <HI>to him that made me; I am an ungrateful, unthankful Dog to him that has given me Life, E&s;tate, and every thing I have in the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have liv'd as if there was nothing due from me,</HI> be|cau&s;e I am a Gentleman. Well, &s;ays he, <HI>I love my Brother &mdash;; tho' I do not do</HI> my <HI>D&V;TY, I mu&s;t acknowledge he does</HI> his, <HI>and I can't but value him for it;</HI> and <HI>that Brute my Si&s;ter, what can &s;he be made of, that</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="131">
<HI>&s;he &s;hould break with him for that</HI> which he does, and which we all <HI>ought to blu&s;h for</HI> not doing; <HI>I'll go and talk to her about it again, &s;ure I &s;hall make her change her mad Re&s;olutions.</HI></P>
<P>All this was upon the Di&s;cour&s;e already related; and he had by this little turning the Thing in his Thoughts, mightily po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf with the Notion of our Serving and Wor&s;hipping GOD, be|ing a Homage due to him, and a Debt mo&s;t rea&s;ona|ble to be paid.</P>
<P>The Power of Natural Religion having gone thus far, he was prepar'd by it to have an aweful Reverence for the &s;erious Part of Religion, and a Love to tho&s;e that practi&s;ed it; and we have &s;een &s;ince, that the Pro|fanene&s;s and Wickedne&s;s of his Si&s;ter brought him to a Horror of her Practice; e&s;pecially that kind of triumphing in Sin, which both &s;he and he too had been always guilty of before; it's true, he was not yet brought to a Sen&s;e of the Nature of &s;inning again&s;t GOD, the Offence again&s;t Divine Love, the in&s;ult|ing Sovereign Mercy, and acting in Rebellion to the Dominion of Grace in the Heart: In a Word, he was not come to the two great Fundamentals of Reli|gion, Faith and Repentance; but we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee him advance.</P>
<P>The wicked and bla&s;phemous An&s;wers his Si&s;ter gave to every thing that he offer'd to &s;ay in Defence of Religion; fill'd him with Horror; his Soul abo|minated to &s;ee Religion, the Name and Wor&s;hip of GOD made a Je&s;t, and the Honour due to GOD his Maker treated with Contempt; and yet he own|ed him&s;elf to be a Creature void of all Religion him|&s;elf; it was true, that the pleading for Religion was perfectly ca&s;ual to him, but his Rea&s;on told him he was right: And it was a Shock to his very Under|&s;tanding at la&s;t to think, that he was then &s;trong pleading for what he did not practi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="132">
Wherefore it often retorted upon him, even in their very Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>I am telling her of D&V;TY, what is her D&V;TY,</HI> and <HI>of her Husband doing his D&V;TY: But what is my D&V;TY? And why do I not enquire a little</HI> about that? This Reflection brought that Ex|pre&s;&s;ion again from him, mention'd a little before, p. 108. when he told her &s;he had been preach|ing to him, and her Words were as good as a Ser|mon; for, &s;ays he, <HI>you have expo&s;ed the Folly and Bru|tality of an irreligious Conver&s;ation &s;o much, by your Way of practi&s;ing it, that I re&s;olve from this Time to amend my Life,</HI> &amp;c. And this he repeated often to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This I may venture to call a full Conviction; and &s;he gave him abundance of other Occa&s;ions to en|crea&s;e it &s;everal Times after the fir&s;t; for &s;he talk'd &s;o profanely and had &s;uch horrid Expre&s;&s;ions, that I have not thought it proper to leave them upon Re|cord, or to acquaint the Mouths of <HI>young Readers</HI> e&s;pecially, with the very Sound of the Words; it's enough to tell you, that &s;he &s;truck him with a kind of Terror, to hear her bla&s;pheme and in&s;ult her Maker; and he was carry'd to that length by it af|terward, as to de&s;ire her, as civilly as his Pa&s;&s;ion would allow him, to leave his Hou&s;e; telling her very plainly, that he could not &s;uffer his Maker to be treated at that rate in his Hearing, or under his Roof.</P>
<P>But the good Knight, for &s;uch I may now begin to call him, receiv'd a Wound from her in the begin|ning of his Convictions, that had like to have pro|ved Mortal to his Reformation, and to have driven him back to his former loo&s;e Cour&s;e of Life, merely by De&s;pair.</P>
<P>This was, when &s;he told him, upon his &s;aying he would pray for her, that he might as well <HI>let it a|lone;</HI> intimating, that his Prayers would not be heard;
<PB N="124" REF="133">
for, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomina|tion,</HI> &amp;c. See <HI>p.</HI> 112. This Expre&s;&s;ion, as it is ob|&s;erv'd there, was a Stab to his Heart, and he &s;top'd in his Di&s;cour&s;e, look'd Pale, and his Si&s;ter was fright|ed, thinking he would have fainted. He recovered indeed, and talk'd a great while with her. But the Arrow was &s;hot into his Vitals, and the Poi&s;on drunk up his Spirits; he ha&s;ten'd the Di&s;cour&s;e with his Si&s;ter, and went away to have found her Husband, as before; and this was the rea&s;on that made him &s;o unea&s;y, when he found his Brother-in-Law was gone to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>His Trouble encreas'd upon him &s;ome Days, and brought him to a dangerous Cri&s;is; he began di&s;pu|ting again&s;t his own Peace from the fatal Text, as he call'd it, which that <HI>wicked In&s;tructor,</HI> his Si&s;ter, had preached from; and he brought it to this dreadful Conclu&s;ion:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"I am a <HI>WICKED Creature,</HI> that's out of Doubt, never was a wor&s;e, this wretched Branch of my own unhappy <HI>STEM</HI> excepted; <HI>WICKED</HI> be|yond others; And to aggravate his Character to him&s;elf, he reckons up its parts thus: <HI>I am a com|mon Swearer, a common Drunkard, a Bla&s;phemer of the Name of GOD, a De&s;pi&s;er of all Religion, that have lived in the Omi&s;&s;ion of all that can be called Duty, and in a general Neglect of Religion all my Days. If I am not included in the word WICKED, then there is no wicked Man in the World.</HI></P>
<P>"The Premi&s;es being thus plain, the Con&s;equence is upon me, my <HI>Prayer would be an abomination to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>"Why then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I mu&s;t not pray at all; and if I cannot pray, all my Thoughts about Religion are at a full Stop; I am <HI>ju&s;t where I was</HI>&mdash;And here he mus'd a while.</P>
<P>"<HI>Ju&s;t where I was,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and Where's that?</HI> A
<PB N="125" REF="134">
Rebel to GOD, a Villain to a merciful Creator, a Reprobate condemned to be &s;o &s;till; forbid to pray to that GOD for Mercy, again&s;t whom I have behav'd &s;o wickedly; unworthy his Mercy, and &s;hut out from asking it.</P></Q></P>
<P>At this full Stop, at this dreadful Period, this poor Gentleman was come; and having mi&s;s'd his Friend, from whom he hop'd to have had &s;ome Comfort and Direction, he came back very melancholly and de|jected.</P>
<P>His Di&s;order was vi&s;ible to all the Hou&s;e; his Lady thought him not well; his Servants thought him out of Humour; his Si&s;ter thought he was angry with her; <HI>which, by the way made a downright Quarrel afterward;</HI> when Gentlemen came to &s;ee him, he excu&s;ed him|&s;elf as indi&s;po&s;ed, ju&s;t &s;poke to them, and beg'd their Pardon to retire; he went out no where; kept no Company; in a Word, he was given up to Melan|choly and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>It continued thus with him &s;everal Days; during which Time he had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance but from his own Thoughts, however he oftentimes argued &s;trongly with him&s;elf, that certainly it did not con&s;i&s;t with the mer|ciful Nature of GOD to forbid Sinners to repent, and to forbid them when they were Penitent, to pray for Forgivene&s;s. But &s;till as the&s;e were but Rea&s;onings within him&s;elf, and here was a po&s;itive Scripture a|gain&s;t him, it overwhelm'd all his Arguments, and left him always in the utmo&s;t Di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>Poor Gentleman, he had had no religious Educati|on to have Recour&s;e to; no In&s;tructions of ancient Parents, which lie as a Fund or Magazine of Directi|ons; and tho' they &s;leep for many Years, yet often revive to the Con&s;olation and Direction of the re|turning Prodigal; his Parents had been all like him|&s;elf, who had bred him up as they had been bred them&s;elves, more to good Manners, than to good
<PB N="126" REF="135">
Principles, more to Letters than to Religion. Nay, &s;o ignorant and &s;o remote had he been led on from any &s;acred Knowledge, that the Scripture, which is the Trea&s;ure of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge to the Ig|norant, the Fountain of Comfort, and the Re&s;torer of Life to the oppre&s;s'd Mind, had little Effect here; he had but little of it in his Head, and con&s;equently little of it could occur to him on &s;uch a &s;olemn and needful Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, as when GOD will &s;peak to the Heart by his Spirit, he never wants a Mini&s;ter, &s;o it hap|pened here; this Gentleman had &s;ome Books, but not many, and fewer &s;till of &s;uch Books as were &s;uit|able to his pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e: But ruminating upon the&s;e Things one Day in his Clo&s;et, he found an old, torn, dirty imperfect Book, written by he knew not who, and perhaps &s;carce ever look'd upon in that Place for many Years, entitled, <HI>The Excellency and &V;&s;efulne&s;s of Reading the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>The Author in pur&s;uing his Di&s;cour&s;e, tells a Story of a Man who was made to de&s;pair even to Rage and almo&s;t to Self-de&s;truction, by reading the 15th Ver&s;e of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> I. and going no farther, when the very next Ver&s;e would have comforted him, and did &s;o it &s;eems afterwards. The Words of the 15th Ver&s;e are thus; <HI>When you &s;pread forth your Hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when you make many Prayers, I will not hear; your Hands are full of Blood.</HI> This put the poor Man, <HI>&s;ays the Story,</HI> into &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">age of De&s;pair, that on a &s;udden he threw his Bible into the Fire, and run about with his Hands lifted up in the Air, crying out, he was ca&s;t off, was damn'd, was a Reprobate, and that GOD would not hear his Prayer if he went about it; and that therefore it was to no Purpo&s;e for him to pray at all. The Story was &s;o appo&s;ite to Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Ca&s;e, that he &s;tew to the Bible, and read the Ver&s;e, with the four Ver&s;es before it, which
<PB N="127" REF="136">
are all to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and had almo&s;t fallen in|to the &s;ame Snare the poor Man did, of whom the Story was told, for he could not with-hold his Pa&s;|&s;ion: But &s;topping at the Ver&s;e, &s;aid to him&s;elf, Who can blame the poor Man? my Ca&s;e is the &s;ame, ju&s;t the &s;ame; and if this Scripture is to be believ'd, <HI>I am undone.</HI></P>
<P>He kept the little old torn Book in his Hand, and tho' he was under an unexpre&s;&s;ible Concern, he was willing to know what became of the Man; when the Story goes on thus: A good Mini&s;ter in the Neighbourhood coming to vi&s;it him while he was in this Extremity, ask'd him from what Occa&s;ion he had taken up his de&s;pairing Thoughts? <HI>From reading the Bible, &s;ays the Man; I wi&s;h I had never &s;een it. The Bible! &s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> that's impo&s;&s;ible! Yes, yes, &s;ays the Man, 'twas from reading the Bible. It &s;hall never be &s;aid, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> that reading the Word of GOD ever made a Man de&s;pair; it has awaken'd and alarm'd many a Sinner, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but it always led them by the Hand to Comfort at the &s;ame time; and I am here, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to vindicate the Word of GOD from that Scandal, and do affirm that there is not a Word of Terror in the Bible, without a Word of Comfort near hand to it. <HI>Come Friend,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Where did you read? Nay, I know not,</HI> &s;ays the Man! <HI>What were the Words,</HI> &s;ays the Mini&s;ter? The Man repeats the Words; <HI>Very well,</HI> &s;ays the Mini&s;ter, <HI>come let me &s;ee the Bible. Nay,</HI> &s;ays the Man, <HI>I have not the Bible, it is burnt; I immediately threw it into the Fire, for I could not bear to read any farther.</HI> The Mini&s;ter pulls a Bible out of his Pocket and gives him; <HI>Come,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>let me &s;ee what were the Words you are &s;o terrify'd with?</HI> Look there, <HI>&s;ays the poor de&s;pairing Creature,</HI> and turns him to the five &s;equent Ver&s;es of the 1&s;t of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> begin|ning at the 10th. The Mini&s;ter knowing the Place, &s;tands up and gives GOD Thanks for vindicating the
<PB N="128" REF="137">
Honour of the Go&s;pel, in directing this Man to quote a Place &s;o qualify'd to make good what he had affirm'd in Defence of the Go&s;pel of Peace; and pray'd aloud that GOD would open the poor Man's Eyes to &s;ee and re|ceive the Comfort from the Promi&s;es, as well as to fear and be di&s;may'd at the Threatnings of the Scrip|ture; when he had &s;aid this, <HI>Come hither Friend,</HI> &s;aid he, look you here; Why had you not Patience to read on the three next Ver&s;es, &s;tay now and read them for thy Comfort, <HI>Ver.</HI> 16, 18, 19. <HI>Wa&s;h ye&mdash;Make ye clean, put away the Evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes; cea&s;e to do Evil,</HI> learn to do well. <HI>Come now, let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the LORD; tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they &s;hall be as white as Snow; tho' they be red like Crim&s;on, they &s;hall be like Wool; if ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the Land:</HI> Having read the Words to him, he added, Here's Comfort, if you can &s;ay you repent of your Sins and reform; <HI>Cea&s;e to do Evil,</HI> and <HI>learn to do well;</HI> the Promi&s;es of GOD are pledg'd to you, that you &s;hall be forgiven; and that <HI>tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they &s;hall be whiter than Snow.</HI></P>
<P>The Story goes on thro' many Particulars, but the Sum of it is, that the Man was comforted, the Word of GOD and the Mercy of GOD vindicated, and a clear View given to every penitent Sinner of the Way to Life and Salvation.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard</HI> read this Story with great Satisfaction, and it kept his Mind in a State of Quiet, tho' not with any great degree of Comfort till his Friend came home from <HI>London,</HI> of which we &s;hall hear farther in in its time.</P>
<P>But to return to his Si&s;ter; after the la&s;t Dialogue between Sir <HI>Richard</HI> and her, &s;he had made &s;ome Ex|cur&s;ions in the Family, that had not been very o|bliging; particularly &s;he had fallen out with Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Lady, which put an end to their Friend&s;hip,
<PB N="129" REF="138">
and removed her from the Hou&s;e: The Ca&s;e was thus:</P>
<P>My Lady &mdash; was a quiet, peaceable, good hu|mour'd Per&s;on; not over and above &s;erious: but far from a de&s;pi&s;er of Religion; and &s;he coming in to her Si&s;ter's Chamber, as &s;oon as Sir <HI>Richard</HI> was gone, found her in Tears, as was &s;aid before, when Sir <HI>Richard</HI> left her; it &s;eems her Crying was the Effect of Rage more than Grief, at what Sir <HI>Richard</HI> had &s;aid to her; and &s;he falls out with the Lady upon the Subject of Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s ill treating of her; and, among the re&s;t, rally'd his being turn'd &s;o Religious all of a &s;udden.</P>

They had not many more Words about it; but taking her Brother at his word, &s;he went away the &s;ame Day in Di&s;gu&s;t, and not re&s;olving pre&s;ently whether to go, &s;he &s;tay'd at a Neighbour's Hou&s;e two or three Days; in which Time &s;he went once down to her own Hou&s;e: She knew indeed her Husband was not at Home, but &s;he had a mind to &s;ee the Children and talk with her Nur&s;e, who it &s;eems &s;he heard had been at Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The old Nur&s;e was over-joy'd to &s;ee her, and treat|ed her with abundance of <HI>God ble&s;s you's, Madam,</HI> as was the poor Woman's way; and it was believ'd, if her Husband had been at Home, &s;he might have been prevail'd with to &s;tay; but &s;he broke away again, tho' the poor old Nur&s;e fell down of her Knees to her, to entreat her to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Being gone thus in a wild Humour, enrag'd that her Brother had, as it were, turn'd her out of Doors; &s;he pa&s;&s;es by a good &s;ober Hou&s;e in the Town, where &s;he might have been welcome, and would have had good Advice, and went to the Hou&s;e of one of her old Companions, about two Miles off; who was in|deed ten times more the Child of Hell than her &s;elf.</P>
<P>Here &s;he told her Tale, and had a She-Devil at her Elbow to &s;ay <HI>YES</HI> to all &s;he affirm'd, and <HI>AMEN</HI> to all &s;he re&s;olved; that prompted her to be wor&s;e than ever the Devil, <HI>for want of an Agent,</HI> perhaps, had an Opportunity to de&s;ire her to be; till at la&s;t, &s;he made her &s;o wicked, that &s;he was frighted with her own Picture, and was brought to reflect upon her &s;elf, and repent, by tho&s;e very Steps the Devil took to ruin her.</P>
<P>It would be a &s;ad, and far from a diverting Story, to give an Account of all the mad Steps the&s;e two Creatures took together, I do not mean as to common Vices; &s;he was too much a Gentlewoman to behave her &s;elf &s;candalou&s;ly; nor was any thing of that kind

ever &s;ugge&s;ted, that I have met with. But her Di&s;|gu&s;t at her Brother, her Aver&s;ion to her Husband, and her Contempt of all that was &s;ober and religious, was carried up by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this Companion of hers, to &s;uch a height, that &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed all Advice, was deaf to the Importunities of her Friends, and e|ven of her Husband as &s;hall be farther related pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>This Companion of hers took that common, but fooli&s;h way, that many think the be&s;t Method of o|bliging their Friends, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of agreeing, and &s;aying Yes, to every thing, Right or Wrong; &s;he had been intimate with this Gentlewoman from her Youth, and bred up ju&s;t in the &s;ame loo&s;e untaught manner; as to any thing religious, a perfect Stranger; as to Sen&s;e, &s;he was <HI>like her &s;elf,</HI> a Toy, gay and vain, empty of all that was Good; as fooli&s;h and as profane as her Heart could wi&s;h. Here &s;he was perfectly ea&s;y, for no Body was friendly enough to admoni&s;h her, or &s;incere e|nough to advi&s;e her; and &s;he liv'd to &s;ee, and to acknowledge, how empty and in&s;ignificant that Friend|&s;hip is, that is not hone&s;t enough to bear, and faith|ful enough to give Reproof.</P>
<P>This She-Friend, among the re&s;t of her Follies, had accu&s;tom'd her &s;elf to a mo&s;t abominable Loo&s;ene&s;s of the Tongue, and gave her &s;elf &s;uch a Latitude of ill Words, that &s;he &s;carce &s;poke ten Words without in|termixing &s;ome of them by way of Ornament; a Cu&s;tom grown up of late to &s;uch a height, that it is become the Vice of our Conver&s;ation; while at the &s;ame Time it is &s;o fa&s;hionable too, that &s;uch People think it adorns their Speech, and that their Language is not polite or genteel without it.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of her fooli&s;h Phra&s;es, &s;he had this in particular, <HI>Poi&s;on it;</HI> or if &s;poken of any Per&s;on, <HI>Poi&s;on him,</HI> or <HI>Poi&s;on her;</HI> this was grown &s;o frequent and &s;o familiar to her Tongue, that it became the

Our unhappy La|dy being now in the Family, they grew intimate to be &s;ure, and in their Conver&s;ation &s;he fail'd not to tell this new Confident all her Grievances; fir&s;t, a|bout her Uncle, the good old Mini&s;ter, and his cal|ling all the Hou&s;e to Prayers. And <HI>you know,</HI> Madam, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>how I hate their Prie&s;t-Craft,</HI> and <HI>the wheed|ling ways that the&s;e Par&s;ons take to make them&s;elves the Heads of Peoples Families, and to make us think them all Saints; yet as I expect to be the old Man's Heir, and he has a good E&s;tate, what could I do?

<STAGE>It &s;eems he had had an Account from &s;ome|body how Things went, and how he might expect to be treated; and that a Warrant from my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice might be wanted: So he furni&s;h'd him&s;elf according|ly.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> I'll deal with her well enough; but in the mean time do you go up to your Mi&s;tre&s;s, de&s;ire her not to be frightned, I am not come to give her any Di&s;turbance; if &s;he would have been pleas'd to let me &s;peak with her, I &s;hould have treated her very kindly: But &s;ince &s;he is prevail'd upon to be &s;o unkind, I will offer her no Violence, though I have Power to do it, <HI>as you &s;ee;</HI> nor would I have meddled with this Firebrand if &s;he had not treated me rudely.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Su&s;an</HI> went up, but before &s;he came her Mi&s;tre&s;s had heard what had pa&s;s'd, and was in a terrible Fright; there was a Pair of Back-Stairs, and a Door at the Stair-head, at which &s;he might have got away: But the Door was lock'd, and the Servants were all &s;o enrag'd at her, that though &s;he enquir'd of them for the Key, no body would give it her: So finding no way to e&s;cape, &s;he &s;at trembling, and expecting every Minute her Husband, or the Con&s;table, &s;hould come up and take her away by force.</P>
<P>But he had no Mind to expo&s;e her &s;o much, nor to
<PB N="143" REF="152">
di&s;order her at all, his De&s;ign being to u&s;e all the Per|&s;wa&s;ions and Entreaties he could, if po&s;&s;ible to bring her to a kind and willing Complyance; &s;o he went away, and bad <HI>Su&s;an</HI> tell her, he would come again another Day when her Surprize was over.</P>
<P><HI>Su&s;an</HI> deliver'd her Me&s;&s;age with all the comforting Expre&s;&s;ions to her Mi&s;tre&s;s that &s;he was able. But &s;he had thrown her&s;elf on the Bed, and would not &s;peak a Word. So the Cavalcade ended; her Husband went away, and the Con&s;table kept the Lady's Com|panion in Cu&s;tody, and carry'd her away with him.</P>
<P>She was now left alone, her Spirits were in a Flame, and &s;he &s;eem'd to talk Wildly and Extravagantly, like one di&s;compo&s;ed in the highe&s;t Degree. Poor <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> though &s;he was di&s;mi&s;t, would not leave her in that Condition, but &s;at by her all the Afternoon, and watch'd her all Night; for <HI>Su&s;an</HI> was afraid &s;he might do her &s;elf &s;ome Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>But alas, her Head run upon wor&s;e things; the Devil had lo&s;t his Agent, and was now fain to do his Work him&s;elf; and indeed, finding his Advantage, he laid hold of it: Her Pa&s;&s;ion, the Devil's be&s;t han|dle, and by which he takes the fa&s;te&s;t hold of us all, was in a violent Ferment; and nothing was &s;o hor|rid but &s;he was capable to entertain a Notion of it, and approve it.</P>
<P>The Object of her highe&s;t Aver&s;ion now was her Husband; the Affront offer'd her was &s;uch, that no|thing could appeale her, nothing be a Satisfaction to her; the Sleep &s;he took in the Night gave no A&s;&s;i&s;t|&s;tance to abate her Fury, but &s;he meditated Revenge with an implacable and an unalterable Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus playing with the edg'd Tools of her own Pa&s;&s;ions, dangerous Weapons they are! the Que&s;tion pre&s;ents to her Thoughts <HI>what &s;hould &s;he do,</HI> once or twice, as &s;he own'd afterwards? The Devil prompted her to go home to him, and in the

Night to &s;et the Hou&s;e a Fire. But &s;he had not Courage fot that. <HI>No,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her &s;elf, <HI>u&s;ing her Companion's wicked WORD;</HI> No, <HI>Poi&s;on him;</HI> I won't do that, I may burn the Children too.</P>
<P>The dreadful Word which her profligate Compa|nion had us'd without any Meaning, or at lea&s;t with|out any Thought of Mi&s;chief, continually rung now in her Ears; it only dwelt upon the Tongue before; but the &s;ubtil Deceiver handed it into her enflam'd Inclination, and plac'd it in Ambu&s;cade there; it was for &s;ome Days working up to a height, the Words follow'd her like a Voice, <HI>Poi&s;on him, poi&s;on him:</HI> At fir&s;t &s;he &s;tarted at the Sugge&s;tion, and &s;eem'd frighted at the Thoughts of &s;uch a horrid Thing; but he that &s;et it at Work, ply'd it &s;o clo&s;e, that &s;he thought &s;he heard no other Sound for &s;ome time, but that, <HI>Poi&s;on him, poi&s;on him;</HI> and as her wicked Companion had made the ugly un&s;ounding horrid Word familiar to her; &s;o her new Tempter begun by degrees to make the Fact familiar to her al&s;o; and fir&s;t &s;he por'd upon the Practicablene&s;s of the Thing, her Head run Night and Day upon the Methods of doing it, and of concealing it; &s;he found all ea&s;y e|nough; he that prompted her to do it, pre&s;ented her with a great variety of practicable Schemes; &s;o that finding no great Difficulty in the Thing, and that it would, as &s;he &s;uppos'd, an&s;wer her End, &s;he came to a Point, and in a Word, &s;he took up the horrid Re&s;olution to <HI>POISON her Husband.</HI></P>
<P>It was not long after &s;he had re&s;olv'd upon this horrid Fact, but &s;he prepar'd for the Execution: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And one Morning &s;he calls her Maid <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> and with a mo&s;t compleat Face of Hypocri&s;y tells her, &s;he had con&s;ider'd her Circum&s;tances, and found Things were run to &s;uch a height, that truly &s;he was loth all the Fault of ruining the Family &s;hould lie upon her; and &s;he could find in her Heart, if

<P>O Madam, <HI>&s;ays Su&s;an,</HI> if God would put it into your Heart, I dare &s;ay my Ma&s;ter would do any thing you &s;hould de&s;ire of him.</P>
<P>And will you go to him, <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> and tell him I de&s;ire to &s;peak with him?</P>
<P>Yes Madam, with all my Heart; I am &s;ure he will come.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> to Morrow Morning you &s;hall go.</P>
<P><HI>Su&s;an</HI> rejoyces, and was &s;o elevated with the Thoughts of it, that &s;he did nothing but cry for Joy all that Afternoon; but little did the poor Wench i|magine that &s;he was to be the In&s;trument of the De|vil, to betray an Innocent Gentleman to be murthered.</P>
<P>At this Meeting, and under the colour of this Trea|ty, did this enrag'd Woman wickedly re&s;olve to give her Husband Poi&s;on in a Di&s;h of <HI>Chocolate,</HI> and it &s;eems had furni&s;h'd her &s;elf with the Materials for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible for any one that has not been engag'd in &s;uch dreadful Work as this, to expre&s;s, or indeed to conceive of the Horror and Confu&s;ion of her Spirits all that Day, and all the Night; neither her Rea&s;on, or her Affection, not the Natural Pity of a Mother for her Children, or the Tenderne&s;s of her Sex as a Woman, took any Place with her; but &s;he went to Bed, nay and to Sleep, with the helli&s;h Re&s;olution of de&s;troying her Husband; and was &s;o far guilty of intentional Murther, as it is po&s;&s;ible for any one to be that had not actually made the At|tempt.</P>
<P>She had not been long a&s;leep but her di&s;turb'd Imagination working &s;till upon the &s;ame Subject, &s;he dream'd her &s;elf into the very Fact.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155">
She dream'd that her Husband came to her, accor|ding to the Me&s;&s;age &s;he had &s;ent by <HI>Su&s;an;</HI> that &s;he entertain'd him with a &s;hew of Tenderne&s;s and Kindne&s;s; that he ki&s;t her, and told her, he was very &s;orry &s;he would not &s;ee him la&s;t time he came; that he had re&s;olved to be reconciled to her, and that the Terms &s;hould be her own, for he could have no Comfort or Satisfaction without her; that if &s;he was offended; he would ask her Pardon, and would abate all acknowledgment on her Part.</P>
<P>In her very Dream &s;he fancy'd her Con&s;cience re|proach'd her with the reflection upon her Wicked Re&s;olution; and bad her ask her &s;elf how &s;he could be &s;o Treacherous to one, that after all &s;he had done, treated her in &s;o obliging a manner.</P>
<P>Yet it &s;eems &s;he got over it all, for though &s;he did not dream of her actually giving him the Poi&s;on, and his drinking it; yet, at &s;ome di&s;tance of Time, for <HI>&s;he awaked between,</HI> &s;he dream'd &s;he &s;aw her Hu&s;|band and her Two Children lye dead upon the Floor, and that &s;ome body ask'd, How it all hap|pened? and a Servant that &s;tood by an&s;wer'd, That no body could tell: When on a &s;uddain, &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw a black Cloud, and heard a Voice as loud as Thunder out of it, which &s;aid, <HI>That wicked Woman, his Wife, has Poi&s;on'd him and her own Children, let her be taken, and let her be burn'd.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be wondred at if &s;he wak'd in a dread|ful Fright; &s;he skreek'd and cry'd in &s;uch a manner that frighted all the Hou&s;e; the Servants ri&s;e and come to her, and an Ancient Woman in particular, that lay near her Chamber, came in fir&s;t, and ask'd her, <HI>What was the Matter?</HI> When they came in &s;he was &s;itting upright in her Bed, but Trembling and Staring in a dreadful Manner: However, it being &s;ome time after her crying out, before they could get out of their Beds to come to her, &s;he was tho|roughly
<PB N="147" REF="156">
awake, and had recover'd her &s;elf &s;o far as to know that it was but a Dream, before they ask'd her what was the Matter.</P>
<P>This gave her &s;ome immediate Relief, and parti|cularly it brought her to &s;o much pre&s;ence of Mind as to conceal the Particulars; and when they ask'd her what it was &s;he dream'd? She &s;aid, &s;he dream'd her Two Children were murther'd: which was true.</P>
<P>Though &s;he recover'd from her fir&s;t Surprize, yet &s;he remain'd very ill all the Night, and all the next Day; and particularly was overwhelm'd with Melan|cholly, &s;peaking very little, and receiving no manner of Su&s;tenance: <HI>Su&s;an</HI> &s;tay'd with her, and endea|vour'd to divert her; but &s;he was capable of re|ceiving no Comfort from her, and often bid her with|draw, and &s;it in the next Room within Call.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Intervals when <HI>Su&s;an</HI> had left her, &s;he began to reflect upon her &s;elf, and would fly out with &s;uch Words as the&s;e; What a Mon&s;ter am I? What a length has the Devil gone with me! Murther my Husband! What, my own Fle&s;h and Blood! Nay, and murther my little dear Innocent Children! Horrid Wretch! <HI>It's True, I had not intended to murther them:</HI> But <HI>would it not have been murthering them, to kill their Father?</HI> It's true al&s;o, <HI>I have not murther'd him;</HI> but I had <HI>ful|ly re&s;olv'd it, my Soul had con&s;ented to it,</HI> and I <HI>am as guilty as if I had done it:</HI> Nay, <HI>I have been murthering him the&s;e three Weeks pa&s;t, I have murther'd that Peace and Satisfaction which it was my part to pre&s;erve and and encrea&s;e to him;</HI> I have tormented <HI>and griev'd his very Soul; I have kill'd all his Joy, all his Comfort that he was to have had in a Wife; I am a Murtherer every way, a vile abominable Mon&s;ter, and Murtherer.</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;he gave &s;ome vent to her Pa&s;&s;ion by Crying; after which, throwing her &s;elf on the Bed, and her Fright and Di&s;order having kept her waking mo&s;t part of the Night, &s;he fell a&s;leep, but in &s;o di&s;order'd
<PB N="148" REF="157">
a Manner, and with &s;o much Confu&s;ion upon her Thoughts, that &s;he &s;tarted every now and then, as if &s;he had been terrify'd with &s;ome Apparition.</P>
<P>At length &s;he got up again, and walking about the Room, but &s;till confu&s;ed with &s;trange Di&s;traction of Thoughts; on a &s;udden a ca&s;ual Storm happening abroad, it lightned, and a terrible Clap of Thun|der follow'd; &s;he was &s;o frightned at this, con&s;ider|ing the Relation it had to the other part of her Dream, that &s;he &s;woon'd and fell down on the Floor, with|out &s;peaking a Word.</P>
<P><HI>Su&s;an,</HI> who &s;at in the next Room before, but had come in while &s;he was on the Bed, run and took her up, and lay'd her on the Bed again; but it was long e're they brought her to her &s;elf: When &s;he began to come to her &s;elf, &s;he asked <HI>Su&s;an</HI> if &s;he heard the Thunder?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, &s;ays <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> it was a dreadful Thun|der; and the Lightning was &s;o terrible, Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> it frighted me out of my Wits.</P>

<P>By this time &s;he was more compos'd, and <HI>Su&s;an</HI> being inqui&s;itive, &s;he put her off; I don't mean now, <HI>Su&s;an, &s;aid &s;he,</HI> but in my Dream <HI>Su&s;an</HI> thought &s;he talk'd a little wild with the Fright, and &s;o &s;aid no more.</P>
<P>But now the Thunder in her Dream came into her Thoughts; Well, &s;ays &s;he, if I had been &s;uch a

horrible mon&s;trous Wretch to have murther'd my Husband, what a Fool had I been al&s;o to have thought to conceal it, when a Voice from Heaven &s;hould pro|claim it in Thunder and Lightning, to my certain De&s;truction. She paus'd, and then breaks out again, thus.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Well,</HI> there is certainly <HI>&s;ome Mighty Power above, &s;omething that knows and &s;ees all we Think or Act.</HI> I have been a dreadful Creature; for there is cer|tainly a God that knows all Things, and can di&s;|cover the mo&s;t &s;ecret De&s;igns that we form but in our Thoughts: and I never acknowledg'd him.</Q></P>
<P>And what if he &s;hould by &s;uch a Voice, di&s;cover now that I intended this bloody thing; then I am undone, and &s;hould be the very Abhorrence and Loathing of all Mankind.</P>

<P>Dear Madam, do not afflict your &s;elf, and your Family, and more; will you give me leave to let my Ma&s;ter know you intend to come home?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do what you will <HI>Su&s;an:</HI> But if I &s;leep ano|ther Night in this wicked Place, I &s;hall be frighted to Death.</P>
</SP>
<P>Hone&s;t <HI>Su&s;an</HI> &s;ent her Ma&s;ter Word of all that had happen'd, and of all the Di&s;cour&s;e, by a very tru&s;ty Me&s;&s;enger. But when the Me&s;&s;enger came to his Hou&s;e he was not at home: <HI>Su&s;an</HI> unea&s;ie, for fear her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Mind &s;hould alter, pack'd up all their things they had, and &s;ending to borrow Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Coach, gets her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who was now wholly in her di&s;po&s;ing, and carries her directly home.</P>
<P>It &s;eems Sir <HI>Richard</HI> and her Husband were gone to deliver the Wretch out of Cu&s;tody, who they had taken up, &s;he having humbled her &s;elf, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e her Endeavour to per&s;wade the other Lady to return home; and it &s;eems &s;he came home to her Hou&s;e ju&s;t as <HI>Su&s;an</HI> was helping her Mi&s;tre&s;s down Stairs. She &s;ent <HI>Su&s;an</HI> word, &s;he would &s;peak with her Mi&s;tre&s;s before &s;he went: But <HI>Su&s;an</HI> bad the Ser|vant tell her, that her Mi&s;tre&s;s had nothing to &s;ay to her. So &s;he came away, brought her Mi&s;tre&s;s home, carry'd her up Stairs in her Arms, for &s;he was very Ill, and put her to Bed.</P>
<P>When &s;he had done thus, &s;he &s;ent far and near for her Ma&s;ter, but he could not be found a good while, which perplex'd <HI>Su&s;an</HI> very much: But at la&s;t her Ma&s;ter came home, and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> with him.</P>
<P>Her Ma&s;ter had but ju&s;t Patience to hear <HI>Su&s;an</HI> tell part of her Story, and then run up Stairs to his Wife: She was &s;o weak &s;he could hardly rai&s;e her&s;elf upon the Bed; but &s;he took him in her Arms, ask'd him Pardon in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Terms, 'till he could bear it no longer; and 'till he oblig'd her to &s;ay not a Word more of it. He told her, Sir <HI>Richard</HI> was be|low.
<PB N="151" REF="160">
<HI>My Dear,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I am not able to &s;peak to him now; but tell him, I am &s;en&s;ible I have u&s;ed him very Ill; and I will ask him Pardon, and my Lady too.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard</HI> would fain have &s;een her; but &s;he de|&s;ired to be excu&s;ed for that Night, for &s;he was very Ill and de&s;ired a little Re&s;t.</P>
<P>She was now brought home to her Family; but as this was not done 'till &s;he was touch'd from Heaven with a Sen&s;e of her Sins, &s;o it was evident in her, that the fir&s;t Effect of real Conviction, is an immediate Return to a Sen&s;e of Duty: She had broke over all the Obligations and Bounds of her Conjugal Rela|tion, as a Con&s;equence of her Rebellion again&s;t God; and as &s;oon as ever &s;he was &s;truck with a Sen&s;e of her Sin again&s;t God, it carry'd her immediately back into the Cour&s;e of her Relative Duty.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now leave her for a while, and go back to Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> who was now as wonderful an In|&s;tance of the Grace of God, as his Si&s;ter; and both of them fir&s;t touch'd with a Sen&s;e of their Wicked|ne&s;s, by the Deformity and odious Appearance of others wor&s;e than them&s;elves; that is to &s;ay, he from his Si&s;ter, and his Si&s;ter from her abominable Com|panion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> as I ob&s;erv'd, had been in a very un|comfortable Condition upon the Occa&s;ion of his Si|&s;ter's ca&s;ting out a Text of Scripture in her Di&s;cour&s;e, which though &s;he de&s;ign'd in a Banter, was made a terrible Text to him, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the <HI>Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomination:</HI> From whence he fell, fir&s;t, to examining his own Condition; and with too much Rea&s;on, to be &s;ure, concluded him&s;elf a wicked abo|minable Per&s;on; and from thence he infer'd that he was forbid to pray to God, that his Prayer would but provoke God the more, and be an Abomination.</P>
<P>I have given an Account by what Accident he re|ceiv'd &s;ome Comfort. But &s;till he was in great Pain

of Mind, and mo&s;t impatient 'till his Brother in Law came home, who, <HI>as before,</HI> was then gone to <HI>London:</HI> As &s;oon as he came, they met, and he unbo&s;om'd him&s;elf to him, as in the following Dialogue.</P>

<P>Be pleas'd to read on, Sir, Ver. 5. <HI>That the</HI> Gentiles <HI>&s;hould be Fellow-Heirs, and Partakers of the Promi&s;e in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This was the My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, and is therefore called the Revelation of Go|&s;pel Grace. <HI>The Ca&s;e was thus:</HI> The Promi&s;es of GOD were at fir&s;t all made to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and they

under&s;tood all the re&s;t of the World to be excluded: But now when by the Coming and Suffering of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Vail of the Temple was rent, and the Se|paration taken away, Men were call'd upon <HI>every where to repent,</HI> and were taught, that they &s;hould be all equally made Children by Adoption, as if they had been &s;o by Birth; and <HI>if Children, then Heirs.</HI> This was the My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, and was now laid open, and was <HI>revealed by the Spirit of GOD;</HI> &s;ignifying, that <HI>the</HI> Gentiles <HI>were made Partakers of the Promi&s;e in Chri&s;t, by the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>

<P>Very clearly thus: That the Convictions of Sin upon your Mind, all the Reflections you make upon your pa&s;t Life, be they occa&s;ion'd by what Con|currence of Cau&s;es &s;oever; all the &s;ecret Aver&s;ions and Abhorrence of pa&s;t Follies, and every &s;ecret De|&s;ire to alter, amend, and change your Cour&s;e; every degree of Regret, Shame and Self-Reproach, which (as you will find) your Thoughts will be fill'd with on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, are a Degree of the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Grace of GOD to you; revealed to, or wrought in you by his Spirit.</P>

<P>Dear Sir, let me be very cautious of running you &s;o early, into tho&s;e dangerous Niceties and Di|&s;tinctions between what we can do, and our being able to do nothing. It is mo&s;t true, that we can do nothing as we ought to do: But we are commanded to repent, to break off our Sins, to cea&s;e to do evil, to learn to do well; the&s;e are all Scripture-Expre&s;|&s;ions, and the Bible is full of them.

any Thing, ot be it that our Duty and Endeavour is accepted, or at lea&s;t our concurring with his Work; certainly we are bid to work, to give diligent heed; we are called upon to turn to GOD, and to pray; and it is our Duty: Let the Operations of invi&s;ible Grace be what they will, and direct how they will, we mu&s;t be labouring and working, that <HI>this Grace of GOD may not be in vain.</HI> Nay, this very Grace of GOD prompts us to do thus, as is expre&s;ly &s;aid, Tit. 2. 11, 12. <HI>The Grace of GOD that bringeth Sal|vation, hath appeared unto all Men, teaching us, that denying &V;ngodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent World:</HI> So that we are not allowed, on Pretence of the Spirit working all in us, to &s;it &s;till and do nothing; this would be to <HI>&s;in, becau&s;e Grace abounds.</HI></P>

<P>I begin to under&s;tand you, and what you &s;ay affects my Mind wonderfully; e&s;pecially when you put me in hopes, that the&s;e &s;ecret Struggles I feel, are from an Operation of the Spirit of GOD. But is that po&s;&s;ible? Will the Spirit of GOD work &s;uch things in the Mind of one &s;o harden'd, &s;o abandon'd to all that's wicked, as I have been!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>He not only will, but often does; nay often choo&s;es to do it; and that for many Rea&s;ons, I mean, Rea&s;ons that we can account for, be&s;ides &s;uch as are alone known to him&s;elf; &s;uch as the glorifying the Power of his Grace, in conquering his Enemies and magnifying the Sovereignty of his Grace in taking and chu&s;ing how, who, and where he plea&s;es.</P>

<P>Not you Sir! why <HI>Mary Magdalen!</HI> why the <HI>Publican!</HI> why the crucify'd Malefactor! why many glorious Examples of &s;overeign Grace! For this rea&s;on it is called <HI>FREE GRACE;</HI> and we find

the Scripture full of Rea&s;ons for this Method, of laying hold of the wor&s;t and greate&s;t Sinner; <HI>the Whole need not the Phy&s;ician:</HI> It's true, this is meant of tho&s;e who had Conceit of their being whole, as the <HI>Phari&s;ee;</HI> but it reaches the Ca&s;e we are upon: Chri&s;t came as the Phy&s;ician, to heal tho&s;e who were mo&s;t dangerou&s;ly &s;ick; to ju&s;tify &s;uch <HI>Publicans</HI> as dur&s;t not go up to the Temple to pray; to receive &s;uch Pro|digals who were yet afar off.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of all the In&s;tances I have read of come up, in my Opinion, to mine; I have run &s;uch a horrid Cour&s;e of all kinds of Wickedne&s;s, that I &s;ee none of them can come up to it: I will not doubt but as you &s;ay, infinite Goodne&s;s can forgive more Sins than a finite Being can commit.

<P><HI>Why Sir?</HI> If I were &s;ure you were the great|e&s;t Sinner that ever was &s;uffer'd to live on the Earth, I &s;hould think it would be a Rea&s;on, why I &s;hould expect the Grace of GOD &s;hould &s;ingle you out, to make you a Miracle of Divine Goodne&s;s, that none after you might be capable of being di&s;courag'd, when they had &s;uch an Example to &s;upport them.</P>

<P>If I were &s;ure the Grace and Spirit of GOD were at work in my Heart, I confe&s;s the Greatne&s;s of my pa&s;t Wickedne&s;s would not &s;o much terrify me; I &s;hould &s;eem like a Man fallen among Murderers, and a powerful Troop came in to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; at who&s;e coming all the Thieves and Villains trembled, and would be unavoidably taken Pri&s;oners, and the Man be deliver'd.

<P>My Meaning is this: You have had Convicti|ons upon your Mind for &s;ome Time; you have been mov'd to reflect upon your &s;elf for the Wicked|ne&s;s of your pa&s;t Life; and to &s;peak of tho&s;e things you us'd to call Plea&s;ures, with the greate&s;t Con|tempt; and of your Delight in them with the greate&s;t Dete&s;tation: I do not doubt you were &s;incere in it, you had no occa&s;ion to be otherways with me.</P>

<P>My Sincerity to you, I hope, admits no Que&s;tion; whether my Heart may not be in&s;incere and deceive me, that I cannot an&s;wer for.</P>

<P>That's what I'm upon; I &s;ay, <HI>Try the Spirits,</HI> whether do all the&s;e Motions tend? Do they carry you on to humble Repentings for Sin pa&s;t, and holy Re&s;olutions for time to come? If this Work puts you forward to Reformation, to a change of Life, to a Love of the Name and Ways of God, and of the People of God; in a Word, if it apparently directs to Holine&s;s, it is the Work of the Spirit of God, there is no room to doubt it; 'tis a Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Grace of God to you, by the Operation of the Spirit: It mu&s;t be &s;o, there is no other Influence either able, or by the Nature of things enclin'd to work in &s;uch a Manner; and you have great Rea&s;on to rejoyce in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! I rejoyce! is it po&s;&s;ible for me to hope? and without Hope is there any rejoycing?</P>
</SP>

<P>The lower you are in the E&s;teem of your Pe|nitent Thoughts, the nearer you are to the Gate of Hope: Remember the <HI>Publican,</HI> he dur&s;t not go forward to the Temple to Pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you touch my very Soul again: why that wicked Creature wounded me there &s;o deep that it entirely robb'd me of all my Hope; &s;he was
<PB N="163" REF="172">
a true In&s;trument of the Devil in that; for as he is in the wor&s;t kind of De&s;pair him&s;elf, he labours to pu&s;h every one el&s;e into the &s;ame Condition; that in their Reflections upon Sin, they may commit the more; for I am very &s;en&s;ible 'tis a great Sin to de|&s;pair, 'tis a Di&s;honour to the Power and Omnipoten|cy of Divince Mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that was, when &s;he banter'd pro|phanely about your praying to God for her, and told you 'twould &s;ignifie nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>That had been nothing; for what &s;igni|fied the Words of a fooli&s;h enraged Creature: But when &s;he repeated that Scripture, <HI>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomination to the Lord;</HI> it was like a Dart &s;truck through the Liver. I knew that was the Word of God, tho' it was &s;poken out of the Mouth of an Evil Me&s;&s;enger; my Heart &s;unk within me at the Words; I quitted talking to her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble, and while I did talk I hardly minded what I &s;aid, my Thoughts were &s;o harra&s;s'd; then I came out to &s;eek for you, but you were gone to <HI>London,</HI> and what to do I knew not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very &s;orry I was gone; but I hope the &s;ame Spirit of God, who was working Convictions in your Mind, gave you Comfort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Brother I receiv'd but &s;mall Com|fort; I look'd upon my &s;elf in the &s;ame Condition as King <HI>Saul</HI> was, when he &s;aid, the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> were upon him, and God was departed from him; the Weight of my Convictions lay upon me, and I look'd upon my &s;elf as &s;hut out from the Gate; one whom God would not hear, as <HI>Saul</HI> &s;aid; and that in a Word, that I was forbid to pray to him; and it wrought &s;uch a Dejection upon my Mind, that I could &s;carce hold up; my Wife and all my Family took notice of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was well no &s;trong Temptation pre&s;ented
<PB N="164" REF="173">
while you were under tho&s;e Troubles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e they were really Temptations, for I was often pre&s;s'd in my Thoughts to give over my Concern about it, to go to the Tavern, or a Vi|&s;iting, or a Hunting, and drive away the&s;e melan|cholly Thoughts: But it was all like Mu&s;ick to a &s;or|rowful Heart, that &s;erv'd but to make it more heavy; and I had no ta&s;te of tho&s;e things, though they were formerly my greate&s;t Delight: But all that follow'd me during this whole time, was the Words of the <HI>Publican,</HI> who&s;e Story you mention'd ju&s;t now, and the Words would often break from me with a kind of involuntary Emotion, <HI>Lord be Merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Very well;</HI> and was it not the Powerful Grace of God <HI>think you,</HI> that pre&s;erv'd tho&s;e Aver&s;ions in you again&s;t your former Delights; that took away your Ta&s;te of tho&s;e Things, and the Gu&s;t of your Appetite from your Plea&s;ures; that &s;ea&s;on'd your Soul with Godly Sorrow, that by the Sadne&s;s of the Countenance the Heart might be made better? Dare you &s;ay that it was by your own Strength, that tho&s;e things which were doubtle&s;s laid in your way as Snares, proved no Temptation to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Strength! How is it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould have the lea&s;t Strength to any thing that is Good, who have given up my &s;elf to all that's wick|ed, through the whole Cour&s;e of my Life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. Then the Powerful Grace of God mu&s;t have &s;upplied you: Give him the Honour of his own Work; let him have all the Prai&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can I prai&s;e him, that cannot pray to him; that am not admitted to take his Name into my Mouth: Who&s;e Prayer is an Abomination? Why he may &s;trike me dead if I &s;hould offer to look up to him. How can I prai&s;e him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all a Delu&s;ion of the Devil; and I mu&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="174">
&s;ay, 'tis one of his mo&s;t old-fa&s;hion'd Temptations. You &s;aid, it came out of the Mouth of one of his Agents; did you not? Why &s;hould you then &s;uffer it to take any hold of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Word of God for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;o it was the Word of God with which the Devil tempted the Son of God; his &s;econd Temp|tation was &s;upported in that manner, <HI>For it is written,</HI> or, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord;</HI> which is the &s;ame Thing: But you mu&s;t explain one Scripture by another, and take the Word of God in the General Meaning, as well as in the Literal Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are things I under&s;tand not. Is not the Thing Plain? Are not the Words Expre&s;s? If they have any other Signification, let me hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, a wicked Man, while re&s;olving to continue in his Sins, his Prayer is an Abomina|tion; the Rea&s;on is evident: He mocks God, and the Word is expre&s;s in that, <HI>God will not be mocked;</HI> that is, it is an Abomination to him to be mocked, he will revenge it, and do his own Honour Ju|&s;tice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the true meaning of that Place; and how &s;hall I be &s;atisfied that it is &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>By farther &s;earching into the Scriptures, and by the general Purpo&s;e of God in the Go&s;pel. It is evident, the whole Scope of the Go&s;pel, and of the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace, which I have mention'd be|fore, is to per&s;wade Sinners to Repent and Turn to God. Innumerable Texts might be quoted to con|vince you of this; but it &s;eems needle&s;s: If Sinners are to turn to God, and yet are &s;hut out from God, from praying for his Grace to turn them, and for his Pardon; how &s;hall they turn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very true; but &s;hew me &s;ome op|po&s;ite Ca&s;e to this, that may overthrow the Force of its Literal Sen&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="166" REF="175">
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll &s;hew you &s;everal; fir&s;t, take the Story of <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Sorcerer;</HI> an eminent Ca&s;e, and exactly the Oppo&s;ite to what you are upon; <HI>Simon</HI> was <HI>a WICK|ED</HI> Man, that mu&s;t be allow'd to an Extream, be|yond what can be thought of here; a Sorcerer, a Con|jurer, one that dealt immediately with the Devil, of whom the Apo&s;tle te&s;tifies afterward, that he was <HI>in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and the Bond of Iniquity,</HI> and that <HI>his Heart was not right in the Sight of God.</HI> If any Man alive was in the Predicament of One who&s;e Prayer is an Abomination, <HI>Simon</HI> was the Man: Yet ob&s;erve what <HI>Peter,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed Preacher of Repen|tance, &s;ays to him, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 22. <HI>Repent therefore of this thy Wickedne&s;s, and Pray God, if perhaps the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee.</HI> Now Sir, what think you? May <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Sorcerer</HI> pray to God, and may not you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have brought a &s;trange Ca&s;e, I con|fe&s;s, and it grows upon my Mind, if I take you right, it is thus, then; That if I am convinc'd of my Sin, regret my pa&s;t Life, and in a &s;incere Abhorrence of my pa&s;t Offences, re&s;olve to reform and become a New Man, I may be a&s;&s;ur'd that I am permitted to pray to God; to ask Pardon, Ble&s;&s;ing, A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Support, and every thing that I want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have &s;tated it right, and I am &s;ure, I have the Authority of God's Word to confirm it: I'll give you the &s;ame Text which was mention'd in our for|mer Di&s;cour&s;e, which you &s;aid you found in the Book about reading the Scriptures, 1. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 15. There are 5 Ver&s;es, from 11. to the 16. full of God's Ab|horrence of, and Abominating the Sacrifices, <HI>that is,</HI> the Prayers of Men who continued in their Sins; the la&s;t runs thus, <HI>When ye &s;pread forth your Hands I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear.</HI> This is a dreadful Scripture; what can be the Rea&s;on of it? the next Words explain it,
<PB N="167" REF="176">
<HI>Your Hands are full of Blood.</HI> This is plain, full of Sin unrepented of, and Sins to come re&s;olved on; to what purpo&s;e can &s;uch Creatures pray?</P>
<P>But read the next Ver&s;e, and there you &s;ee the Terms on which GOD is always ready to hear the wor&s;t of Sinners; Ver. 16, 17. <HI>Wa&s;h ye, make you clean, put away the Evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes; cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well: Come now, let us rea&s;on together.</HI> The meaning of this is as clear as the Light; come repenting, re&s;olving to break off from your Sins, and GOD will then accept your Offering: and then follows the gracious Promi&s;e; <HI>Tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they &s;hall be whiter than Snow, &amp;c.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very true, but you are not of the la|te&s;t, you are but a young Man, not two and thirty; you may have many Days to live, and may if GOD plea&s;e, be an Honour to his Ways, and be honour'd by him, to be a great Encouragement to others to look up to him, tho' it &s;hould be later than you do it: I wi&s;h the eminent Appearance of GOD's Grace in your Ca&s;e, may be made u&s;e of as a Summons to other Gentlemen, to turn their Eyes inward and &s;ee into their Follies, and into the wretched Life mo&s;t of them live at this time.</P>

<P>My Wife told me &s;o indeed once, in our Di&s;|putes, that Gentlemen never meddle with &s;uch Things; that it was incon&s;i&s;tent with good Breed|ing; that it was fit for Par&s;ons indeed; and that if I would &s;et up to be Chaplain, and &s;ay Prayers in the

<P>No, neither will I mind them; but this I tell you, I mu&s;t be a Reclu&s;e, and keep no Com|pany; I mu&s;t leave off vi&s;iting Sir <HI>Harry C&mdash;</HI> and Col. <HI>Bra&mdash;,</HI> I mu&s;t go no more a Hunting, nor meet the Club at &mdash;, I am no Company for the&s;e People now; and I am &s;ure they will be none for me.</P>

<P>I hope you will not find &s;o much Lo&s;s in that as you may imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no Grievance to me at all, there is nothing in all the Mirth that I have been given up to, but what is now as nauteous to me as ever it was plea&s;ant. The Wit, the Gayety, and the Revelling which they u&s;e &s;till, and which was my whole Em|ploy, is to me &s;o di&s;agreeable, and has been &s;o for this Week pa&s;t, that I cannot bear the Thoughts of it.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir, you will find better Entertain|ment in Things of another Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what I may attain to, as to the Comfort of a religious Life Brother, that's a very remote Thing to me yet; but I am &s;ure I have Work of another kind before me, I have Bu&s;ine&s;s enough to employ me more Years than I can life; to mourn for the Vanity and abhorr'd Practices I have liv'd in for thirty Years pa&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that Affliction will have more Joy in it than all the Plea&s;ures of Sin, which are indeed Plea|&s;ures of but a &s;hort Continuance. There is a Plea|&s;ure in Repentance, which none can de&s;cribe but they who have had the Experience of it, and which none can give but he alone, who gives Repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of that yet, but this I know, I have more &s;ecret Joy in my Mind from this Reflection, <HI>viz.</HI> that a &s;top is put to that helli&s;h wretched Cour&s;e of Life I have liv'd for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, than all the Enjoyment of this World ever was

able to give; and I would not exchange that Joy for all that I can &s;ee with my Eyes.

How often have I torn my Fle&s;h almo&s;t for Rage, at my being &s;o much a Fool to be drunk, and for &s;everal other little Follies which tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es were often attended with; and yet in all that, there was no Repentance; no Sen&s;e of its being a Sin a|gain&s;t GOD; no Thought of its being injurious to my Soul; no regard to its being a Fire, that in the End would burn into the lowe&s;t Hell.</P>

<P>It plea&s;ed GOD this Gentleman did not live many Years; but while he did live, he encreas'd in Wi&s;|dom and Knowledge, and the Fear of GOD; he reform'd his Hou&s;e, brought up his Children in a mo&s;t excellent and Chri&s;tian Manner, and made a mo&s;t exact Regulation in his Family; and he did this with &s;o much Conduct, and behaved to all Men &s;o much like him&s;elf, and &s;o far from any thing melan|choly, phlegmatical or &s;ullen, which are the Ex|tremes

<HEAD>Brief Notes on the foregoing three Dialogues.</HEAD>
<P>I Should make no Notes upon the&s;e Dialogues, the Book being &s;o crowded that I can very ill &s;pare Room for them, but I am aware that Differences be|tween Men and their Wives are &s;uch nice Things to handle, that it will be very difficult to avoid the Cen&s;ure of &s;ome People on one Side or other: The <HI>LADIES, if they are enclin'd to find Fault,</HI> will per|haps &s;ay, I am partial to the Sex, and give them the wor&s;t End of the Staff, making them more the Oc|ca&s;ion of Family-Breaches than their Husbands; and making their Husbands treat them &s;o much more ten|derly and religiou&s;ly than mo&s;t Husbands in &s;uch provoking Ca&s;es do; that it looks as if I was teach|ing Men how to manage their Wives.</P>
<P>The Men perhaps may on the other hand, com|plain, that I have treated them ill; which I &s;hall an|&s;wer in its Place, when I come to &s;peak of pa&s;&s;ionate Fathers and Husbands; which when the &s;ame Ladies read al&s;o, they will be le&s;s apt to think me partial.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak to every Thing in its Place thro' this whole Part, it will be ea&s;y for an impartial Eye to di|&s;cern the De&s;ign of the Work; which is this, and no other, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to let every one have &s;omething for their own Caution and Direction.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="182">
(1.) The wretched Trifles which are <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> the Occa&s;ion of fatal Breaches in Families; how &s;imply, how weakly, and indeed how wickedly &s;uch People act when they run little Family Bickerings up by ra&s;h and imprudent Degrees, from &s;uch unfore&s;een Be|ginnings, and by &s;uch ha&s;ty and bitter Words, to real Quarrels.</P>
<P>And (2.) how &s;uch Quarrels, however &s;mall in their Beginnings, are oftentimes fatal in their Con|&s;equences to the whole Family.</P>
<P>In the managing the&s;e Breaches will be di&s;cover'd, how particularly fatal they are to all Family-Religi|on; how de&s;tructive to that mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part of it, I mean, <HI>Family-Wor&s;hip;</HI> and how ruinous in the Example to Children, Servants, and all that are any way acquainted with, or concern'd in the Family: The&s;e Things being not only the chief, but indeed the true and only De&s;ign of the&s;e Dialogues, I can|not but hope that all impartial Readers will keep their Eyes principally upon that Part; and then they will not enquire which Side the Story bears harde&s;t upon, the <HI>Man</HI> or the <HI>Woman.</HI> I hope both may &s;ee their Duty here, and yet before they come to the End of the Book, I believe the Women will find the Hi&s;tory will do Ju&s;tice to their Sex too, and that it will appear, as I believe, <HI>(without Flattery)</HI> is true in general, that there are more religious Wives than re|ligious Husbands. I wi&s;h and pray, that what is re|lated here may increa&s;e the Number of both.</P>
<P>Another In&s;truction I cannot omit to repeat here, and to pre&s;s Husbands again to ob&s;erve it; <HI>and this I profe&s;s to be the true Rea&s;on of bringing the Story of</HI> two deficient Wives <HI>upon the Stage (viz.)</HI> that as it is true, that Husbands and Ma&s;ters of Families <HI>too often</HI> make u&s;e of Trifles as Occa&s;ions to them to omit their Duty, <HI>SO</HI> they too often throw the Blame of it up|on their Wives. Here <HI>now</HI> they will be mov'd to
<PB N="174" REF="183">
&s;ee, (1.) That in the Ca&s;e of real Provocation and Oppo&s;ition, and that of the wor&s;t Kinds, even of Wives de&s;pi&s;ing and mocking at it, they are yet by no means ju&s;tify'd in laying down and omit|ing their Duty. (2.) How much le&s;s then &s;hould they &s;eek Occa&s;ions and Pretences to argue them|&s;elves out of their Duty, and load their Wives with the Blame, when indeed the Occa&s;ion is in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t u&s;eful and mo&s;t &s;ignificant Thing to be learn'd out of this Part of the Work, and which e|qually concerns both Husbands and Wives, is &s;tudi|ou&s;ly to avoid &s;udden Cavils and Di&s;putes between them&s;elves about Trifles, in which often <HI>the Devil blowing the Coals,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ions take Fire, and it en|crea&s;es to a terrible Flame; when perhaps neither Side had at fir&s;t the lea&s;t De&s;ign or Thought of a Quarrel.</P>
<P>I per&s;wade my &s;elf, none are &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the Truth of the Occa&s;ion <HI>as to &s;ay,</HI> it does not often &s;o happen: Perhaps in our Story, the Husbands are brought in talking more mildly and patiently than mo&s;t Husbands do, and as &s;ome may think, than mo&s;t Husbands can do in like Ca&s;es of Provocation. <HI>B&V;T let none be offended at that,</HI> for this is &s;o far from a Compliment to the Men, that it is really a Satyr up|on them; letting them &s;ee, how they <HI>O&V;GHT to act</HI> in the wor&s;t Ca&s;es; and giving their Wives too much Occa&s;ion to &s;how them the real Difference between what <HI>they do</HI> and what <HI>they &s;hould do:</HI> And if on the other hand, &s;ome Wives here are brought in as ex|ceedingly and more than ordinarily provoking; the Application is &s;till again&s;t the Husbands, who too often are le&s;s patient, when their Pretence of Provo|cation does nothing near come up to this Copy.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Family In&s;tructor.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="dialogue">
<P>_THERE liv'd in the City of <HI>London,</HI> a Family circum&s;tanc'd in the follow|ing manner: The Ma&s;ter of the Fami|ly was a &s;ub&s;tantial trading Man, a|bove the World, <HI>as we &s;ay,</HI> a Man in very flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances, that got Money apace, and had the Pro&s;pect of rai&s;ing a good E&s;tate for his Children, by his Trade; he had a very &s;mall Beginning, but what he had was rai&s;ed from little or nothing, being the Fruit of God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon a great deal of Indu&s;try, and about 30 Years Application.</P>
<P>He had been marry'd to a very good Wife: But &s;he dy'd too early to have any great &s;hare in the E|ducation of her Chilren, the elde&s;t being not above &s;even years Old when they lo&s;t their Mother.</P>
<P>The Man was a &s;ober hone&s;t Man, made an Ap|pearance of being very Religious; by his general Conduct had obtain'd a very good Character, and was well re&s;pected among his Neighbours: But in his
<PB N="176" REF="185">
Family he could by no means pa&s;s for a Man of the be&s;t Temper in the World: He was froward and wa&s;pi&s;h, very po&s;itive and ha&s;ty, &s;oon put into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and very unhappily ra&s;h, and violent in his Pa&s;&s;ion; and, <HI>as to &s;uch Tempers it often happens,</HI> he fail'd not oftentimes both to do and &s;ay Things in his Pa&s;&s;ion, which he would be very &s;orry for when his Temper cool'd: When he came to him&s;elf, he was convinc'd, <HI>as we &s;hall &s;ee in his Story,</HI> that he had taken wrong Mea&s;ures: and that being hurry'd on by the Torrent of his Pa&s;&s;ions, he had been le&s;s a Man, le&s;s a Chri&s;tian, le&s;s a Friend, le&s;s a Neighbour, le&s;s a Parent, than he ought to have been; and in a Word, that almo&s;t all his Children were ruin'd, or injur'd, and he robbed of the Comfort of them, by the Mi&s;takes committed in their Education, and by the Heat of his mi&s;guided Anger.</P>
<P>Yet the Man was of him&s;elf, and when him&s;elf, an Excellent Per&s;on, extreamly affectionate and ten|der; lov'd his Children, and meant every thing for their Good: But wanting Judgment to direct him|&s;elf in the Government of his Family, not choo&s;ing out proper Per&s;ons to advi&s;e with in the doing it, and then being impatient in bearing the Excur&s;ions of his Children, who, for want of early Di&s;cipline, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oon grew ungovernable: The&s;e Things all con&s;pir'd to make him very unhappy, and his Children too; and his Unhappine&s;s appeared in nothing more than this, that none of his Children gave him any hopes of their Behaviour; nor indeed could they, unle&s;s they forc'd their Way, as it were, over the Belly of their Father's Injunctions, and &s;eem'd di&s;obedient to him in his mo&s;t Po&s;itive, and almo&s;t Tyrannical Fa|mily Government.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;e before me, of the Citizen and his Family, had many Things in it very unhappy both to the Parent and to the Children, which a little early
<PB N="177" REF="186">
Conduct might have prevented in both, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The want of a Mother in the Family, was a Mi&s;|fortune both to the Father and to the Children; tho' as Things were manag'd, the Father &s;upplied that Want as well as in &s;uch a Ca&s;e could be expected, committing his Children to a good, grave, &s;ober, and religious Woman, a near Relation of his Wife's; who was poor, and depended upon him, and who he pla|ced in a kind of Superintendency over his Family, while his Children were very young.</P>
<P>This Gentlewoman was diligent in the Govern|ment of his Hou&s;e, as could be expected; faithful, frugal, and <HI>to the be&s;t of her Judgment,</HI> manag'd eve|ry thing both for his Advantage, and the Advantage of his Family. But as &s;he neither had the Obliga|tion, much le&s;s the Affection of a Mother; &s;o nei|ther had &s;he the Temper, the Patience, the Concern, which are natural to the Conduct of a Mother; neither had her Authority an Influence upon the Children equal to that of a Mother; and be&s;ides, &s;he was as Pa&s;&s;ionate as the Father.</P>
<P>However, while they were little, Things went pret|ty well in the Family; &s;he took a Hou&s;wifely Care of them as to Food, Cloathing, Phy&s;ick, and the like: <HI>But alas!</HI> when we come to talk of the Duty of a Mother, in the more &s;erious Part of Children's Education, &s;uch as in&s;tilling betimes Religious Prin|ciples; forming early Ideas of the Nature of God, and of our Homage and Duty to him; the Power of Per&s;wa&s;ion, to prevail calmly on the Minds of Children by Argument, &s;uitable to their Capacities, and &s;uited to their Temper; watching over them with an Affectionate Care, le&s;t they receiv'd Evil Impre&s;&s;ions from the Company and Example of o|thers; warning them, reproving them, re&s;training them, gently drawing them off from the Evil, and engaging them by all the Arts, and hone&s;t Sub|tilties
<PB N="178" REF="187">
of an Affectionate Mother, to what was their Duty; the&s;e, in which con&s;i&s;ts very much of the Advantages of Education, were all wholly wanting.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay it was wanting from the Negligence of the Per&s;on, &s;o much as from a kind of Natural Impo&s;&s;ibility: Perhaps the&s;e things <HI>cannot</HI> be found in any thing but a Parent, as being built upon the Affections and Tenderne&s;s of a Mother only; and capable of being form'd upon no other Foundation than that of Nature, and natural Duty.</P>
<P>On the contrary to this, the Children were brought up in a general Way, without much Judgment, and with no great A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Affection. The Fa|ther, a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, left it wholly to his Go|verne&s;s, and found him&s;elf little concern'd, but up|on any of her Complaints, to correct them; which he did in a Manner that &s;eem'd rather to be the Ef|fect of his Pa&s;&s;ion, than of a meek and calm Affecti|on for their Good; which is the main, and perhaps the only ju&s;t End of Correction.</P>
<P>This intemperate Conduct of the Father, had a double Effect upon the Children: (1.) that it cau&s;ed them to hate the Government, and even the Per&s;on of their Hou&s;e Tyrant <HI>(&s;uch they call'd her when they grow up.)</HI> who they look'd upon as the malicious Cau&s;e of their Father's Anger, which often appear'd to be ag|gravated by her Manner of repre&s;enting Things to him; when a candid and ju&s;t Information, perhaps, would have had a different Effect. (2.) It made their Father terrible to them, by which they &s;tood in a kind of Awe of him, far different from what was Filial, and which con&s;i&s;ts with the Duty and Affecti|on of Children; but help'd to e&s;trange them rather than engage them: And they grew up by the&s;e de|grees to &s;hun their Father as a furious dreadful Go|vernour, and not at all either to de&s;ire or delight in him; which is the only effectual Method to enforce
<PB N="179" REF="188">
the Commands and In&s;tructions of a Father upon his Children.</P>
<P>As this e&s;trang'd the Children from their Father, &s;o in increas'd his Severity to them; and in a Word, there was &s;o little Calmne&s;s on one &s;ide, and &s;o little In&s;truction on the other, that <HI>in a manner</HI> it wore out what we call Affection, on both &s;ides; e&s;pecially that endearing Part which alone unites the Souls of Pa|rents and Children, and which &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ts in the In&s;tructing of Children, as to give a far greater Force to the Words of a dear and tender Parent, to a loving, dutiful and affectionate Child, than can be po&s;&s;ible in the Blows and Stripes of a Father govern|ing by his Authority purely; for as <HI>Reproof enters far|ther into a wi&s;e Man, than an Hundred Stripes into as Fool;</HI> &s;o doubtle&s;s the Per&s;wa&s;ions, the Arguments, the Obligation of a Father to a Child, when once that Child is convinc'd that his Father loves him, acts for his Advantage, and aims wi&s;ely for his Good on|ly, mu&s;t go a great way farther with an Ingenious Temper, than meer Blows with Pa&s;&s;ion and Heat of Anger can ever do.</P>
<P>The Father too late found his Mi&s;take, and that his Pa&s;&s;ion in Correcting his Children had quite ruin'd all that which was to be call'd In&s;truction; that they were rather terrify'd and frighted at his Fury, than influenced by his Per&s;wa&s;ion: That this way of treating them was &s;o far from engaging their Affecti|ons to him, or making them love and delight in him, that it made them &s;hun and avoid him; that his An|ger being &s;o much their Terror, it made his Compa|ny their Aver&s;ion, and they were always mute when he came into the Room to them.</P>
<P>By this he lo&s;t all the Power of In&s;truction, his Ar|guments made no Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Rea&s;on; his Per&s;wa&s;ions were of, no Force to bya&s;s their Inclina|tions; nay, it rather ob&s;tructed their Compliance,
<PB N="180" REF="189">
and created an Aver&s;ion to the Precepts of their Fa|ther, from the di&s;lilke they had to his pa&s;&s;ionate U|&s;age of them: As he had made his Pa&s;&s;ion the Me|dium of his Government, &s;o their Fear was the Me|dium of their Obedience; and this was &s;o far from winning upon the Judgment of his Children, that it rather &s;tupifyed their Under&s;tandings, and made them incapable of getting Good by the In&s;tructions of their Parents.</P>
<P>It happen'd one time, that a good grave Chri&s;tian, a Neighbour of this Man's, coming by his Hou&s;e, heard a terrible Noi&s;e of Blows, and the Cries of a Boy mingled with the Voice of a Man, threatning, calling Names, and &s;aying on Blows in an unu&s;ual Manner; and gue&s;&s;ing what it was, for he knew the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Per&s;on, he knocks hard at the Door.</P>
<P>Knocking at the Door gave the poor Boy &s;ome Re|lief, for the Father leaves off beating his Son, and comes with a little Cane in his Hand to open the Door, but &s;o out of Breath that he could &s;carce &s;peak. The good Neighbour made the Di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome o|ther Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;erve for the Rea&s;on of his Knocking at the Door, and did not &s;eem to purpo&s;e &s;peaking of the Ca&s;e in Hand: But after other Di&s;cour&s;e acci|dental, the Father pre&s;ented him an Opportunity; for when he began to &s;peak of other Bu&s;ine&s;s, he be|gan to talk of his wicked Son, as he call'd him, and of his own Heat, thus:</P>

<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I mu&s;t &s;ay then, if you can bear &s;o much Freedom, that I think you are greatly to blame.</P>

<P>To blame! what to correct a young lying Rogue? why, as I &s;aid ju&s;t now, he will come to the Gallows if I do not correct him; be&s;ides, it is my Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know that Correction rightly manag'd, is both your Duty, and the kinde&s;t Thing that you can do to your Child; you could neither act the Parent or the Chri&s;tian, if you did not correct him. But I think you are mi&s;taken, and err exceedingly, both in the Manner and in the Mea&s;ure; and I doubt, are wrong too in the Cau&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t explain your &s;elf: What you mean as to the Manner, I know not; and as to the Mea|&s;ure, how can you judge of it, unle&s;s you knew the Offence more exactly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but fir&s;t let me begin with the Man|ner; I do undertake to &s;ay, you &s;in more in the man|ner of Correction, than your Son can have &s;inn'd a|gain&s;t you, in the Offence you &s;peak of.</P>
</SP>

<P>How can I &s;in in correcting my Child, is it not my Duty? Am I not commanded to do it, and not to let my <HI>Soul &s;pare for his Crying?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, you are &s;o commanded, and if you corrected him purely in Obedience to the Com|mand of God, and for the Amendment and Reform|ing, or Reclaiming the Child, and from no other Motives, you were right in the Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and &s;o I do, I think; what other Mo|tives can I have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, dear Sir, what Rea&s;on for all this Heat? And whence comes this Pa&s;&s;ion? The Duty of Correcting a Child knows no Pa&s;&s;ion: You quite

&s;ink the Father and the Chri&s;tian, by turning a Fury and a Mad-man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, I think you are mi&s;taken; how can I beat the Boy, if I am not angry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I an&s;wer that, give me leave to tell you, that I di&s;tingui&s;h between Anger and Rage; there is Di&s;plea&s;ure and there is Pa&s;&s;ion: I may be di&s;pleas'd with my Son when he commits an Offence; for no good Man but is di&s;pleas'd at every Thing that is &s;inful; but when that Di&s;plea&s;ure ri&s;es up to Pa&s;&s;ion, 'tis quite another thing; Pa&s;&s;ion is but a kind of &s;hort Madne&s;s, and has no relation to the Duty of correcting our Children; 'tis a Frenzy.</P>
<L>Anger is Madne&s;s, and as &s;trong</L>
<L>In Force, tho not in Cour&s;e &s;o long.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think I can beat a Child, and not be in a Pa&s;&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I know not what you can do, but I know what you ought to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray tell me your Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, the End of Correction is to a|mend the Child, not giving vent to a Provocation; if you correct your Child or your Servant otherwi&s;e, you only gratify your Pa&s;&s;ion; you can't be &s;aid to correct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what do you call Correction then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you put that Que&s;tion, for I think you do not know in the lea&s;t what it is. Correcti|on is &s;howing the Child our Di&s;plea&s;ure at his Of|fence: And this is done, Fir&s;t, By Reproof. Second|ly, In&s;truction. Thirdly, Puni&s;hment. For I take them to be all but Part of Correction. The Reproof is perform'd generally in Words of Di&s;plea&s;ure, in which we are particularly to take care to be angry, and &s;in not: <HI>That is to &s;ay,</HI> &s;how your Di&s;plea&s;ure at the Crime, <HI>be angry;</HI> but let not that Di&s;plea&s;ure cun you out into a Pa&s;&s;ion, into Indecency and Di&s;|order,
<PB N="185" REF="194">
into violent and furious Words, which are &s;inful; <HI>be angry, but &s;in not.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make &s;trange Di&s;tinctions, I do not &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>After the Reproof, In&s;truction is the next Duty of a Parent; which is no more or le&s;s than an Exhortation, which the Parent &s;hould always give the Child to reform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think I can &s;tand and make a long Story to him, to in&s;truct and exhort, as you call it, when I am to correct him? Why, fir&s;t of all, he is &s;uch a harden'd young Rogue, he would laugh at it all; he would not mind a Word of it, no, nor re|member a Word of it half an Hour after, but go a|way and mock at it, and do the &s;ame Thing again, till he forces me to make him remember, by his feel|ing the Smart of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you try'd it? do you &s;peak of your own Knowledge or by Suppo&s;ition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the Temper of him &s;o well that I am &s;ure of it, nothing but Blows will do with him; I tell you, you don't know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e that were true now, yet do you think you do well to correct, before you have in|&s;tructed your Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, In&s;truction to him is &s;peaking to the Air, 'tis Water &s;pilt upon the Ground; he mu&s;t be cudgel'd, he mu&s;t be broke like a Hor&s;e; and I'll break him, or I'll break the Heart of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I &s;ee your Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o much con|cern'd in your managing your Child, that you begin to be in a Pa&s;&s;ion with but &s;peaking of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you talk &s;o much out of the way as to him, that it puts me into &s;ome Heat again; but come excu&s;e me, I'll lay it a&s;ide, I am not in a Pa&s;|&s;ion with you; I hope you don't take it &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I do not talk out of the way of
<PB N="686" REF="195">
your Management, but I am &s;ure I do not talk out of the way of your Duty; I cannot be mi&s;taken in that, I doubt not to convince you of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t take the Temper of the Boy with the Duty of the Father, and the La&s;t may alter ac|cording to the Fir&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find you talk of your Boy, as if he had no Capacity of receiving In&s;truction; that he has no Sen&s;e but that of Feeling; or Pa&s;&s;ion, but of Fear; and &s;o you expect to reform him as you break a Hor&s;e. Now I mu&s;t tell you your own Allu&s;ion, be|&s;ides its being unnatural and unchri&s;tian, as to your Child, is again&s;t you too, even as to a Hor&s;e; for you ought not beat a Hor&s;e in a Pa&s;&s;ion any more than a Child; but with Management and Art, that he may be taught to know at the &s;ame Time what 'tis for, and how he may avoid it: And the ill timing of Blows by the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion, even to a Hor&s;e, makes him wor&s;e, not better, and has co&s;t many a Man his Life. <HI>For Example:</HI> A Hor&s;e &s;tumbles per|haps on plain Ground, the fooli&s;h Rider flies into a Pa&s;&s;ion; <HI>a Dog! a Toad!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>What &s;tumble upon &s;mooth Ground!</HI> and then lays on upon the Hor&s;e. The next time the Hor&s;e &s;tumbles, he runs away for fear of more Blows, and perhaps falls and throws his Rider, and it may be breaks his Neck. Pray who is to blame, the Man or the Hor&s;e? And this U&s;age teaches a Hor&s;e to do it; &s;o that &s;ome Hor&s;es when they happen to &s;tumble, they'll run forward let the Ground be proper or improper for it; and I tell you, many a Man has had his Bones broke by that very thing; I appeal to your own Knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very true, I confe&s;s; I have ob&s;erv'd it in a Hor&s;e, but never with &s;uch a Reflection as you make of it; but I own, it requires Judgment and Skill in breaking a Hor&s;e, and to di&s;po&s;e the Blows &s;o as to bring the Creature to our Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="187" REF="196">
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And much more &s;urely in the Ca&s;e of a Child than of a Hor&s;e; Blows are to in&s;truct, and calm Words with them help that In&s;truction, and &s;ometimes abate, if not totally prevent the Blows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Neighbour, I can't talk to them: If I &s;hould &s;tand over them and preach to them as you propo&s;e, I &s;hould forget all my Anger; the Pa&s;&s;ion would be over, and I could not &s;trike them one Blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;till a Demon&s;tration that your bear|ing your Boy has nothing at all of Correction in it, but a meer Excur&s;ion of your own Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand no other Correction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you under&s;tand nothing at all of the Duty of correcting a Child; Blows have no Voice that a Child can under&s;tand, without having them explain'd: Whenever you correct your Child, you &s;hould fir&s;t explain to him the Nature of the Offence, lay before him his Sin again&s;t GOD, in breaking in upon his Duty to his Parents. The Sin of the particu|lar Crime you have found him commiting, <HI>&s;uppo&s;e of Lying,</HI> or <HI>Stealing,</HI> or <HI>whatever it be;</HI> you &s;hould then with an affectionate Tenderne&s;s, tell him the Nece&s;&s;ity you are in to correct him, to &s;ave his Soul from Death; how loth you are to do it; how &s;orry to have &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; how fooli&s;h and unkind to him&s;elf it is to oblige his Father to do this, &s;o much again&s;t his Will. The&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es will &s;ink deeper in his Mind than all your Stripes, and to an ingenuous Spirit it will be wor&s;e than Correction, and your Blows may be the fewer. <HI>For,</HI> as before, <HI>Reproof enters farther into a wi&s;e Man, than an hundred Stripes into a Fool;</HI> and it will be the &s;ame in a wi&s;e Child. Dr. <HI>Busby,</HI> the famous School-ma&s;ter of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> School, us'd always while he was correcting the Boy for a Fault, to &s;ay this Sentence to them, <HI>Ca&s;tego te, non quod odium habeo &s;ed amem,</HI> I cha&s;ti&s;e thee, not that I hate thee, but becau&s;e I love thee.</P>

<P>This is fine Philo&s;ophy, but you had as good &s;ay nothing; it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to talk all that to a Boy, and then correct him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you will never be able to di&s;charge that mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Duty of a Parent, to give whole|&s;ome Correction; for Pa&s;&s;ion de&s;troys the very Na|ture of Correction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I &s;hall not indeed; for I tell you, if I talk to the Boy before I &s;trike him, my Pa&s;&s;ion will be all over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o it ought to be, before you begin to correct, and yet you ought to correct him too; but if your Pa&s;&s;ion is not over before you correct, I tell you, you de&s;troy the End of Correction; Blows are to be given for In&s;truction; if you give your Child Correction without Reproof and Per&s;wa&s;ion, you do like a carele&s;s Phy&s;ician, that &s;ends you Phy&s;ick, but gives no Direction when, or how to take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then I mu&s;t talk to him afterwards; for I tell you, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to talk to him when I am in a Pa&s;&s;ion, or to correct him when I am out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may as well &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to do the Duty of a Father; it is your Duty, and it mu&s;t be done; and never talk of its being impo&s;|po&s;&s;ible; there is no &s;uch thing in Religion as <HI>an impo&s;&s;ible Duty.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;o much argue again&s;t the Thing; I think you are in the right, that it would be be&s;t, and that it is the propere&s;t way; but I &s;ay again, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What makes it impo&s;&s;ible to you?</P>

<P>Then that Temper is your Infirmity, and if not &s;truggl'd with and te&s;train'd, is your Sin, and mu&s;t be repented of, and pray'd again&s;t; perhaps if

The Murderer will ex|cu&s;e him&s;elf by his being of a pa&s;&s;ionate Temper, <HI>ju&s;t as you do:</HI> The Drunkard will plead the Heat of his Con&s;titution that makes him continually thir&s;ty: The Thief, an avaritious Temper: The debauch|ed Rake, the Acrimony of his Blood, and the like; no doubt, Nature is vitiated and tainted with &s;everal Infirmities, whether originally, and by De&s;cent from the fir&s;t Man, is not our pre&s;ent Subject, but &s;o it is; there are powerful Inclinations to do Evil in e|very one, which we can give very little account of; and where the&s;e are not govern'd by the Power of our Rea&s;on or Sen&s;e of Religion, they become our Governors, and pu&s;h us upon unavoidable Folly: So far the&s;e natural Inclinations are &s;inful, and we mu&s;t oppo&s;e, re&s;train, watch again&s;t, and &s;truggle with them; and the Omi&s;&s;ion of that Oppo&s;ition is a great Sin.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I &s;hall bring it home directly to you: If any of the&s;e predominate Inclinations govern you; pray how can you, under their evil Influence, pre|tend
<PB N="190" REF="199">
to be a good Governour of your Children? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that which is Evil in it &s;elf, can direct you to that which is Good? Can you gather Grapes of the&s;e Thorns? or Figs of the&s;e Thi&s;tles? Can the&s;e corrupt Trees bring forth good Fruit? Can you under the Influence of a demented Rage, give a Child a due, a paternal, a con&s;cientious Correction? Is it a Temper fit to go about that Work in! Can you think to bring your Child to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> when you are not ma&s;ter of your <HI>own &s;elf?</HI> Can you rea&s;on with the Youth when you are out of your Rea&s;on your &s;elf? Pa&s;&s;ion dive&s;ts the Soul of the u&s;e of its Rea&s;on for the Time: And is a Man that cannot act his own Rea&s;on, a proper Per&s;on to reduce a rebel|lious Child to Rea&s;on!

<P>But do you not carry it too far? Sure I may be a little angry, a little in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and not be &s;o unfit to correct as I &s;hould be, if it came on to what you call Rage and ungovern'd Fury: Sure I may talk to the Boy, and correct him too without Sin, tho I am a little moved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I affirm the contrary, it is again&s;t the Na|ture of the Thing: Correction I tell you, is an Act of Love, Pity, Duty, Zeal; Duty to GOD, Duty as a Parent, as a Chri&s;tian; Love to the Child, to his Soul, to his Body; 'tis the greate&s;t In&s;tance of Paternal Affection, 'tis the highe&s;t Token of a &s;in|cere Concern for his Pro&s;perity here, and his Salva|tion hereafter: 'tis an In&s;tance of Zeal for the Ho|nour of GOD and of Religion; for the Pre&s;ervation of Vertue and Humanity; what Concern can the Pa&s;&s;ions of a Man have in the&s;e Things? <HI>We know,</HI> &s;ays the Scripture, <HI>that the Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD.</HI> The Rage and Fury with which Men correct Slaves, is acted upon another Principle; it aims at breaking the Spirit, &s;ubduing the Will, and obtaining an ab&s;olute entire Subjection in the poor Bond's Man, to the tyrannical Authority of his Patron: There is neither Concern for Soul or Body expected in the Ma&s;ter; no Love to his Slave's Per&s;on or Concern for his Future State; nothing is in View but to have his Work done, and his Com|mands be without re&s;erve obey'd: To treat a Child with Pa&s;&s;ion and Rage, is the &s;ame Thing as other Men treat Slaves; But the Nature of Correction, as it re&s;pects a Father to a Child, or a Chri&s;tian Ma&s;ter to a Servant, is quite different; Pa&s;&s;ion can bear no &s;hare in it. Nor ought you to touch the Child while one Spark of the Flame is left unextingui&s;h'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Rule have you for this &s;trict Injunction? I &s;ee nothing of it in the Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I readily acknowledge that the Scripture
<PB N="194" REF="203">
&s;eems to be more &s;ilent in this Ca&s;e than in any o|ther of like Con&s;equence; and yet the Scripture is not altogether empty of Directions: But it is true, that Children are &s;o apt to lay hold of every Thing that they can but &s;uppo&s;e abates their Ob&s;ervance of the Subjection they are commanded to be in to their Parents, that the Wi&s;dom of the Apo&s;tles was not a little &s;een, in touching more lightly than ordinary the Danger of Parents Mi&s;takes, in the Manner of their exerci&s;ing their Authority. But, as I &s;aid, the Nature of the Thing directs it &s;o evidently, that there &s;eems to be no Occa&s;ion of inculcating it &s;o expre&s;ly; the natural Affection <HI>to,</HI> and the Concern and Care of all Fathers <HI>for the Welfare of</HI> their Children, makes it rational, that Correction mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t with tho&s;e Tenderne&s;&s;es; and what Share have our Pa&s;&s;i|ons in tho&s;e Paternal Principles? How con&s;i&s;ts toge|ther the Rage of the Man <HI>as a Man,</HI> with the Bowels of a Father, <HI>as a Father?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but a little Anger may be &s;o natural that it cannot be avoided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot abate a Tittle: <HI>No Anger!</HI> no, not the lea&s;t in Correction; the Nature of the Office of a Father is incon&s;i&s;tent with it: It may be Correcti|on indeed, but it is not Paternal; a Father's Cor|rection mu&s;t be all in Love, meer Kindne&s;s and Ten|derne&s;s; if one Spark of Anger be in your Brea&s;t, touch not your Child, at your Peril be it: For the Principles are directly contrary, and will cla&s;h; and in a Word, cannot be con&s;i&s;tent one with another. Be&s;ides, by being calm and cool in your Correction, you leave room for the Pleading of your Children; perhaps, &s;ometimes for a ju&s;t Vindication, which in your Pa&s;&s;ion you will not allow: Perhaps &s;ometimes you may &s;ee le&s;s Rea&s;on for Correction than at fir&s;t you imagin'd, and that the Blows might be &s;par'd; for Parents, like the great Parent of the World
<PB N="195" REF="204">
&s;hould <HI>not willingly</HI> correct; &s;hould be always glad to find, that the Child did not de&s;erve what he thought at fir&s;t he did: Correction is an Act of Nece&s;&s;ity, not of Satisfaction; and by a wi&s;e and tender Pa|rent, is done with Reluctance, not with Delight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you forgot what I &s;aid, I &s;ay you do not allow for unavoidable Anger; there may be &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;e either by the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Offence, the frequent Repetition of it, or many other Circum|&s;tances which may force Anger; &s;o that a Man can|not help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, a Man may be &s;o provok'd, that he cannot help being angry; but he can help corre|cting his Child, while that Anger is upon him; he may defer the Execution, when he cannot defer the Sentence. Nor can I &s;ay, but even that Anger which cannot be help'd or &s;uppre&s;s'd is an Evil, be the Cau&s;e ever &s;o provoking: But to go about to cor|rect the Child while the Fit of Anger is not off, is making that &s;maller Evil a very great one. I once &s;aw a Father act in a Manner which I would recom|mend as an Example to all Chri&s;tian Parents: He was provok'd exceedingly by an in&s;olent and ob&s;ti|nate Child in a trifling Matter, but to &s;uch a height, as to give his Father very &s;aucy and undutiful Lan|guage. The Father, with a Smile of Compa&s;&s;ion up|on his Folly, return'd thus: <HI>SON, if I was not very angry with you, I would teach you better Manners this Minute; but I'll give my &s;elf Time till to morrow.</HI> Be|fore to morrow, the Son relented, humbled him|&s;elf, and prevented the Correction he would cer|tainly have had.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, that what you propo&s;e is po&s;&s;ible to human Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no que&s;tion to be made of the Po&s;&s;ibility, if Men would &s;et &s;eriou&s;ly to work to govern their Pa&s;&s;ions, reduce them&s;elves to Temper,
<PB N="196" REF="205">
and not be too ha&s;ty to act even where they may think they have ju&s;t Occa&s;ion. <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> had unque&s;tionably a very ju&s;t Occa&s;ion to be angry, and they give the greatne&s;s of the Provocation as an Ex|cu&s;e for their unbounded Rage, <HI>Should he deal with our Si&s;ter as with an Harlot!</HI> Yet good <HI>Jacob,</HI> who knew that all Excur&s;ions of human Pa&s;&s;ions tended to Sin, pa&s;s'd Sentence upon it as an abominable Fact; <HI>Cur&s;ed be their Anger, for it was fierce, and their Wrath for it was cruel.</HI> And to this he added a terrible Sen|tence, <HI>I will divide them in</HI> Jacob, <HI>and &s;catter them in</HI> I&s;rael.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard much of Mens governing their Pa&s;&s;ions, but I &s;ee little of it in Practice; for my own Part, I confe&s;s I have not the Government of my &s;elf when I am in a Pa&s;&s;ion, any more than a drunken Man has in his Wine; but I never am in a Pa&s;&s;ion but it is a trouble to me afterwards on many Accounts; particularly, I am fain to break all the ha&s;ty Vows and ra&s;h Re&s;olutions I make in my Pa&s;|&s;ion, becau&s;e if I did not, I &s;hould ruin my &s;elf and all my Family &s;ometimes, and that has often troubled me very much; but as to this of not correcting my Children in a Pa&s;&s;ion, I never con&s;ider'd it at all be|fore, but I begin to believe I have been in the Wrong very much; and I think verily it is one Rea|&s;on why my Children are not one Jot the better for all the Blows I give them; and yet what with one or other of them, I think my Hand or my Tongue is &s;eldom unemploy'd about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to governing the Pa&s;&s;ions, it is a thing would take up a long Conference by it &s;elf, and I &s;hall be glad to talk of it with you at any Time; and particularly, I could tell you a melancholly Story of a Friend of mine and an Acquaintance of yours, who is ju&s;tly at this Time, in a dreadful Extremity, between the Wicked making of pa&s;&s;ionate Vows and
<PB N="197" REF="206">
Wi&s;hes, and the Nece&s;&s;ity he is in of breaking them again, or de&s;troying him&s;elf and his Family; all which lie very heavy upon him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know who you mean I &s;uppo&s;e, and I know the Ca&s;e too, it is Mr. &mdash; the &mdash;r, about the Marriage of his Children; he told me the Ca&s;e him|&s;elf: but I am too guilty my &s;elf of tho&s;e ra&s;h Things, to be able to give him any advice, I rather want Ad|vice in like Ca&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay that I am fit to advi&s;e him, but I am &s;ure he is not capable to advi&s;e him&s;elf; and he has de&s;ir'd a Meeting with me and a Friend or two of his, to talk about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would be glad to be there, if I thought it was proper; I may perhaps &s;tand in need of your Admonition as well as he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is not for me to introduce you; but if he brings you with him, it is well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but I'll have his leave to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to return to the Ca&s;e in hand; I de|&s;ire to go back where we were ju&s;t now: You &s;aid, that you thought you were not &s;o our of your &s;elf in your Pa&s;&s;ions as I might imagine; and I have been arguing &s;ince that, upon a Suppo&s;ition, that it was &s;o; and that you were ma&s;ter of your &s;elf more than perhaps I imagin'd, and than perhaps is true; and yet I have prov'd to you, that even then, &s;uppo&s;e you were in a Pa&s;&s;ion at all, you ought not at all to correct your Child till that Pa&s;&s;ion was entirely cool'd and gone. But now you mu&s;t give me leave to tell you, that I believe you were really in a mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and under the Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;o much Rage, that you &s;carce car'd or con&s;ider'd what you did, or what became of the Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you mi&s;take me quite, I had not beat|en him &s;o violently; did not you hear my Kin&s;wo|man that keeps my Hou&s;e, call to me, and tell me, that I had not beaten him enough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="198" REF="207">
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did hear a Voice of one ju&s;t doing the Devil's Work for him, <HI>viz.</HI> throwing Oyl in&s;tead of Water upon the Fire; any one might have known it was not the Mother of the Child, nor the Wife of the Husband, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, hardly a Chri&s;tian; I have &s;carce ever heard the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, &s;he is not their Mother, but &s;he loves the Children very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, perhaps very well for a Stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay &s;he is no Stranger, &s;he is nearly related to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no matter for that, &s;he has no Principle from Nature to dictate to her the Affection of a Mo|ther, or a Wife; had &s;he been the Mother, compa&s;|&s;ion to the Child would have mov'd her; had &s;he been a Wi&s;e, compa&s;&s;ion to you would have mov'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a good Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had not &s;aid &s;o, I &s;hould have believ'd quite otherwi&s;e of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I hope &s;o, and I am &s;ure &s;he wi&s;hes the Children very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then &s;he mu&s;t be a Fool, for to be &s;ure &s;he knows nothing what belongs to Education, much le&s;s to Correction; for as every Father has need to be very careful not to mix his own Pa&s;&s;ion and Folly with his Duty in Correction; &s;o every By-&s;tander in the Family, that has either Affection to the Duty, or to the Party, will be acting the Part of a Mediator rather than an Inflamer; and they that prompt the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Parent are Incendiaries in the Family, not Friends to the Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is rather a Good Woman than a Wi&s;e Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you &s;ay it was a right part for her to act, as a Relation to the Child, or as a Relation to you; and did it plea&s;e you to hear what &s;he &s;aid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t own, I thought &s;he might as well have
<PB N="199" REF="208">
held her Tongue; I am apt enough to overdo the Work, &s;he needed not to prompt me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I perceived you did not give the Boy one Blow the more for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have given them all many a Blow by her procurement, when I have had Rea&s;on little enough, and when it has griev'd me afterwards very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is of a mighty Healing Spirit I find; &s;he vends her own Re&s;entments too, and only lays the Drudgery of her Pa&s;&s;ions upon you; Is that her be|ing a Mediator?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's an Office very few under&s;tand, nor is it to be expected from Hou&s;e-Keepers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that makes the Duty of a Father the more difficult, where he is left de&s;titute of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a Mother to his Children; and for that Rea|&s;on Fathers ought to be very cautious of &s;etting Go|verne&s;&s;es over their Children, and much more cau|tious of what Authority they put into their Hands: It's a dangerous thing to tru&s;t the Correction of Chil|dren to tho&s;e who want the Bonds of Nature to tye their Hands, however otherwi&s;e intru&s;ted in the Fa|mily: Children &s;hall be often abu&s;ed, but &s;eldom cor|rected by &s;uch: Nor will the Children ever fail, as they grow up, to remember the u&s;age of that kind as Injuries, not as Acts of Faithfulne&s;s to their Tru&s;t. <HI>But that by the by.</HI> What I am now upon, in the Duty of &s;uch Family Tyrants, for they are generally &s;uch, in tempering and cooling the Pa&s;&s;ions of Parents; a true Father is always glad of a Mediator, to abate and take off the edge of his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, and indeed I want that help as much as any Man living; but my Hou&s;e-keeper, tho' otherwi&s;e well enough, has not much of the tender Part, &s;he &s;eldom takes a Blow off from a Child, but rather calls for laying more on, as you heard her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, as before, &s;he is a Firebrand in your
<PB N="200" REF="209">
Family, and wants either to be taught the Duty of her Place, or to be di&s;mi&s;s'd from it: Her Duty would be, when the Child has committed a Fault, to repre|&s;ent it as favourably and as affectionately to you as po&s;&s;ible; to per&s;wade you fir&s;t of all not to re&s;ent it too much; and if there was a nece&s;&s;ity of Correcti|on, &s;he &s;hould &s;tand by in cool Blood and prevail with you to hold your Hand, when perhaps you might not &s;o well govern your Warmth; and &s;ometimes you &s;hould permit her to re&s;cue the Child from you, and you would thank GOD and her too for it after|wards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is in &s;hort, you would have her be a Mo|ther, which &s;he is not, nor can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, though &s;he cannot have the natural Tyes, yet Prudence would teach her thus much; that by this &s;he would gain deep Root in the Affecti|ons of the Children, and that Affection would give her Words a double influence over them; and this &s;he ought to improve for their Good, for when &s;he has ei|ther conceal'd part of their Guilt, or &s;av'd them from part of their Puni&s;hment, &s;he has room to per&s;wade and argue with them to amend, and to de&s;erve no more what &s;he deliver'd them from before; and thus &s;he may win upon their Di&s;po&s;itions, and obtain an Au|thority over them that you are not able to give her, I mean, an influence on their Affections; by which &s;he would have a va&s;t advantage to do them Good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but you do not know my Children; they all hate her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why is that? but becau&s;e &s;he has not practis'd this Method with them. I know nothing of your Family Affairs, but the nature of the thing di|ctates it. Go home, and ask any of your Children the Que&s;tion, Why do not you love your Cou&s;in&mdash;I dare undertake, if the Children dare be &s;o free with you, they would an&s;wer, Becau&s;e Sir, we know &s;he
<PB N="201" REF="210">
&s;ets you again&s;t us; &s;he always magnifies every trifling things to you, and makes you angry with us when &s;he need not, and when with a good Word we might mend it without a Complaint; and when we have done a Fault, and you are ju&s;tly angry, &s;he always makes you more angry than you would be. Tell me now hone&s;tly, if you don't think this would be the Ca&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, you have hit very exactly the thing, and I have often &s;aid to her, when I have been too furious in beating my Boys, <HI>CO&V;SIN, Why would you let me beat him &s;o much?</HI> Why did'nt you come' <HI>and take him away?</HI> And &s;he would always &s;ay, <HI>I take him away!</HI> not I truly, <HI>I think you don't Correct him e|nough;</HI> the Boy will be good for nothing, and the like; and it has made me an&s;wer, if you were a Mother you would be of another Mind. But I confe&s;s, my Boys are &s;urely refractory Creatures, and it alters the Ca&s;e very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you, or &s;he either, had begun with them when they were very Young, and had joyn'd together, the one to have acted like a Chri&s;tian Fa|ther, and the other to have taken the Mother's Part &s;o much upon her, as I hinted ju&s;t now; your Chil|dren would have been quite another &s;ort of Creatures, and you would have had little or none of this Work to do now; they would have lov'd you as well as fear'd you, and they would have had, not a Value for her only, but for what &s;he had &s;aid too; whereas now all &s;he can &s;ay to them, by way of In&s;truction, will &s;tand for nothing with them: For where they hate the Per&s;on, they will very rarely take the Advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that's the Truth of it, there is not one of them loves her; and now they begin to grow up, they don't fail to let her know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it's a wonder if they love you any more than they do her; for where the Pa&s;&s;ions of a
<PB N="202" REF="211">
Father run your length, they rather whip their Chil|dren's Affections away than encrea&s;e them; and when your Children once cea&s;e to love you, what good do you think your In&s;tructions will do them? They will only get from under your Government as &s;oon as they can, and then you will have the Charge of them in|deed, but very little of the Delight that you would have had in or from them; for you are but now lay|ing in a &s;tore of Unkindne&s;s between you and them, and robbing them of the ble&s;&s;ing of a Father, and your &s;elf of the comfort of your Children; whereas Correction given in a Fatherly and Chri&s;tian manner will make your Children love you the more, and the Impre&s;&s;ion of it leave not only an immediate Influ|ence upon their Manners and Morals, but the more they grow up to years of Under&s;tanding, the more they will be &s;en&s;ible of the Ju&s;tice and Kindne&s;s of their Father in their former Di&s;cipline, and will love and value them the more for it; the Scripture is plain in this, <HI>We have had Fathers of the Fle&s;h who corrected us, and we gave them Reverence;</HI> that is, we gave them Reverence for that very Correction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very right in this part indeed, for I &s;ee very little Affection in my Children to me, e&s;pe|cially my Sons; but they &s;hun and run away from me, and care not to conver&s;e with me now they be|gin to grow up, and I think verily it is from my be|ing &s;o furious to them all along; I &s;ee my mi&s;take, but 'tis too late now to help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you &s;hould &s;trive to alter your Con|duct &s;till, and e&s;pecially with tho&s;e who are &s;till young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I do not know how to be familiar with them my &s;elf; I have been &s;o u&s;ed to beat and whip them, and to give them hard Words, that I hardly know how to give them any other U&s;age now they grow bigger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="203" REF="212">
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s there is a danger in the Familiari|ty with Children too; it requires a great deal of Prudence to treat our Children with a decent Fami|liarity, and yet pre&s;erve the Maje&s;ty and Authority of a Parent; and much of the Prudence of this Part lies on the Children's part in not a&s;&s;uming an indecent equallity; and therefore though I do not wholly a|gree to the Proverb, <HI>that Father and Son are good Friends, but bad Company;</HI> yet in many Ca&s;es, and e|&s;pecially where the Children want Manners and the Father wants Gravity, it will be true: A Levity of Behaviour in a Father, di&s;honours the Parent in the Eye of his Children, and will &s;oon bring him into Con|tempt with them; and a forwardne&s;s to an Equality in a Son, di&s;gu&s;ts the Father, and is not at all grate|ful to a Man of any Sen&s;e; but there is a mode&s;t Medium which will, <HI>if it can be hit right,</HI> make the Father the mo&s;t agreeable Company to his Children in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is as difficult a Part, as any Father has to act in his whole Paternal Office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;o, but the Foundation of it is all laid in the early Conduct of the Parents to their Chil|dren; and this brings me back to the Article of Cor|rection, in which I have one thing more to &s;ay, which perhaps more nearly concerns you than all that I have &s;aid yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is it? You a little &s;urprize me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why as we ought not to mix our Pa&s;&s;ions with the Re&s;entment in the Offences of our Chil|dren, nor correct them in gratification of our Anger; &s;o we ought to be very careful that we do not do them Inju&s;tice in correcting them, and inflict a Puni&s;hment without a Crime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by Inju&s;tice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I mean, we ought to give them a fair hearing, and with a calm Examination patiently in|quire
<PB N="204" REF="213">
fir&s;t into the Fact, and be very &s;ure that they are guilty of the thing for which we are angry; o|therwi&s;e it mu&s;t kindle in the Mind of the Child an inexpre&s;&s;ible Contempt of their Father's Ju&s;tice, and con&s;equently leave hereafter a deep impre&s;&s;ion of Anger and Re&s;entment in their Children.</P>

<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fir&s;t of all an&s;wer me this Que&s;tion, Did you correct your Son for the Fault you mention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> his &s;taying of the Errand you &s;ent him, or did you clear an old &s;core with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I am not &s;o patient neither; I never run in Debt to my Sons I a&s;&s;ure you, I always make punctual Payment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And perhaps &s;ometimes make your Payment when there is no Debt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They take pretty good care of that, they make a con&s;tant Claim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>NOW</HI> you &s;ay, you had but one particular thing that you puni&s;h'd him for; pray let me hear what it was over again, for I doubt I have you fa&s;t in a Noo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I corrected him for &s;taying on that Errand, and for nothing el&s;e; and con&s;idering how often he had been corrected for the &s;ame Fault, I think he de&s;erv'd it very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But had you fir&s;t calmly enquir'd into the Fact? Are you &s;ure he was Guilty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, ay,</HI> Guilty, I am &s;ure he was Guilty; he had been gone above an Hour, and the di&s;tance was next to nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="205" REF="214">
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but had he nothing to &s;ay for him&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, Yes,</HI> he never wants &s;omething to &s;ay; he made a formal &s;tory of his going to the Hoop Tavern by <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> to find him, and of &s;taying there <HI>I know not how long</HI> for an An&s;wer; but I knew his Rogues Tricks, I knew 'twas all <HI>a Lye,</HI> he has been at play all the while, to be &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you corrected him at a venture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and no great venture neither, for I did not believe a word he &s;aid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e now the Boy was Innocent, and really had been &s;o far, and had &s;taid there &s;o long, <HI>what then?</HI> would not you think you had done him wrong?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly yes, I &s;hould own I had been wrong, but he is &s;uch an old Offender, that if it had been &s;o, it had only been an advance of Payment, and he would &s;oon have ballanc'd Accounts with me; if he did not de&s;erve it to day, he would be &s;ure to de&s;erve it to morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but we are not now in je&s;t, I am arguing &s;eriou&s;ly, that the Injury is to our &s;elves to fall upon our Children unju&s;tly; ob&s;erving how it le&s;&s;ens us in their Affection, weakens our Autho|rity, ennervates ju&s;t Correction it &s;elf, and plants an early Contempt of the Parents in the Minds of the Children.</P>

<P>I know you are &s;erious, and I do not &s;et light by what you are &s;aying, I a&s;&s;ure you; only I know I am out danger of having that part charg'd upon me.</P>

<P>Why then in the words of <HI>Nathan</HI> the Pro|phet to King <HI>David, THO&V; ART THE MAN;</HI> for I am providentially a Witne&s;s at this time for the poor Child, <HI>though I knew nothing of this part,</HI> that he is wholly Innocent.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I am indeed, neither is it of any u&s;e in any part of our Family-Conduct as I &s;ee; for I a&s;&s;ure you, my fooli&s;h ha&s;ty pa&s;&s;ionate Temper has run me into &s;uch ra&s;h things relating to my Children, and to my Family, that I have cau&s;e to repent of them as long as I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but a pa&s;&s;ionate Man mu&s;t do &s;o; and though I know not the Particulars, yet I can ea&s;ily judge it is &s;o, for I mu&s;t tell you, a Man very &s;eldom does any thing at all in a Pa&s;&s;ion but he finds rea&s;on to repent of it afterwards; for as the Pa&s;&s;ion it &s;elf is wicked, and mu&s;t be repented of, &s;o the Production of it is all the &s;ame; the Fruit can never be good if the Tree be evil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have mention'd one mi&s;chievous Effect it has had upon me, <HI>viz. that when I am heated, or mov'd,</HI> I am apt to make ra&s;h Vows and Re&s;olutions, &s;uch as if I dur&s;t keep them would ruin my Family; and then my breaking them is a continual breach of Peace to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it is u&s;ual for Pa&s;&s;ionate Men to do all manner of ra&s;h Actions; the World is full of dreadful Examples, of which I could tell you &s;ome if I had time.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray &s;pare a little time for what I de&s;ire of you as to this. I wi&s;h you could coun&s;el me as effectu|ally in that Ca&s;e, as you have done in this; for I think what you have &s;aid in this Ca&s;e is &s;o clear, and &s;o convincing, that if it plea&s;es God to keep me, and
<PB N="208" REF="217">
to help me to keep my Re&s;olution, I will never &s;trike a Child again, let the Provocation be as great as it will, 'till my Pa&s;&s;ion is quite gone, and 'till I have en|quir'd fully into the Fault and fairly heard what De|fence he can make; and even then will, as you hint, talk as calmly and moving to him as I am able in or|der to reform him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear what you &s;ay, <HI>and I thank GOD for the occa&s;ion of a Di&s;cour&s;e that has been &s;o ef|fectual:</HI> But pray take one thing with you, you mu&s;t not always after this calming Di&s;cour&s;e, omit the Correction of your Children, e&s;pecially where the Crime requires it; only take care never to give your Pa&s;&s;ion any &s;hare in it, or room in your Mind when you do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll endeavour that too, but I &s;carce know how to promi&s;e for my &s;elf; I am &s;ure I &s;hall &s;hed as ma|ny Tears as the Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you will, and it's the mark of a &s;erious Correction when the Parent is afflicted as much as the Child is corrected; that's a true Paternal Spirit; and I mu&s;t tell you, there's a great many teaching Circum&s;tances in a &s;erious Father's correcting a Child: When he is calling the Child to an account for his Offences, how naturally does it occur, that if God &s;hould thus enter into judgment with us all, what would be our Portion! when he concludes that the Child de&s;erves Correction, it immediately occurs again, if GOD &s;hould deal with us as we de&s;erve, how &s;hould we &s;tand before him! When he corrects, he remembers how GOD's Correction is le&s;s than our Iniquity de&s;erves, that there is no proportion be|tween the Crime and the Puni&s;hment! When the Child &s;tretches out its Hand for Mercy and Pardon, how ju&s;t an Emblem is it of our Penitent Applicati|on to GOD for Forgivene&s;s of our Sins? I know nothing in the World &s;o fruitful of profitable Medi|tations,
<PB N="209" REF="218">
as the Authority of a Father in Correcting, and the Compa&s;&s;ion of a Father in Forbearing his Child. The Reluctance of the Mind with which we correct our Children, the Joy we have to find them Innocent when we fear them Guilty; alas, when Pa&s;|&s;ion intervenes, all this is lo&s;t; the end is de&s;troy'd, the Child &s;uffers, the Father &s;ins, and the Benefit of Correction is lo&s;t entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard you with a plea&s;ing attention, I believe it is all &s;o; I acknowledge I have never u&s;ed to act that wi&s;e Part, my Pa&s;&s;ions have always rob'd me of the comfortable Reflection you mention; but I re&s;olve to act quite another Part I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

<P>But what &s;ay you to the&s;e ra&s;h Vows, and hair-brain'd Prote&s;tations, which in my Pa&s;&s;ion I have often made, and which it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to keep?</P>

<P>I cannot pretend to advi&s;e in that Ca&s;e 'till I hear the Particulars, and perhaps it may not be convenient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, yes, I am too much a&s;ham'd of having offended, to be a&s;ham'd to acknowledge it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That is a certain Token of a true Penitent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My great Folly is, that when I am in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion I make ra&s;h, wicked, and intolerable Promi|&s;es and Vows, which I dare not keep, and yet dare not break; if I keep them I ruin my Family, if I break them I ruin my Soul: What wretched Con|dition does Pa&s;&s;ion run a Man into when not guarded with Grace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a very terrible Extream of Pa&s;&s;ion indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it's not many Weeks ago that in a vio|lent Pa&s;&s;ion with one of my Sons, for a Fault indeed bad enough, but too trifling for &s;uch a Re&s;olution, I

turn'd him out of Doors, and vow'd I would never have any thing more to do with him, and he &s;hould never come into my Doors again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and did you keep it? Pray, what is become of the Boy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Child! he &s;at crying upon a Stone ju&s;t without the Door a good while, and by and by it rain'd; and there he &s;at till he was thorough wet, and till I cry'd as fa&s;t within Doors as he did with|out Doors; and I had no more Power to keep my Vow, than I had Power to refrain making it; &s;o one wicked Thing follows another, and both gives us Occa&s;ion for Repentance; and the&s;e Things break the Peace of my very Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you a &s;hort Story, like yours; I knew a good Man, but &s;ubject to like Pa&s;&s;ions with you, that upon &s;ome unkind provoking Words of his Wife, went out of his Hou&s;e, and wi&s;h'd it might fall on his Head if ever he came into it again. He had a Family of Children, to whom he was a render Father; neither was he an unkind Husband to his Wife, and &s;he was a very loving affectionate Wife to him; but a &s;udden Breach happen'd: Nor was the thing about which it happen'd of any great Value or Con&s;equence proportion'd to &s;o much Heat; but Words on one hand begat Words on the other, and both pa&s;&s;ionate at that Time; in &s;hort, the Man went away, and kept away two Days, and &s;o long his Di&s;|gu&s;t kept his Pa&s;&s;ion up. But when the Heat cool'd, and the Man con&s;ider'd what dreadful Con|&s;equences to his Family mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend the keeping &s;uch a Vow, he immediately came to this conclu&s;ion; I have &s;inn'd greatly in making this ra&s;h Vow, but I mu&s;t continue to &s;in as long as I live, if I keep it; I'll ca&s;t my &s;elf upon GOD's Mercy and ask Pardon for my Sin, and venture the Con&s;e|quence; for it is my unque&s;tion'd Duty, not to ca&s;t off my Wife and Children.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="220">
In this Frame the good Man went comfortably, tho' penitently home to his Wife, who received him with the &s;ame Temper as he came in: I think I need &s;ay no more to your Ca&s;e than tell you this Story, only add one Thing for your Ob&s;ervation; the good Man I &s;peak of was too &s;incere in his Re|flections, ever to make any more &s;uch ra&s;h Wi&s;hes: I hope you under&s;tand the Application of the Story, as well as the Parallel of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a dreadful Mi&s;chief to Men and to Fa|milies, when Men mov'd by the Violence of their Pa&s;|&s;ions make &s;uch Vows, as are &s;carce lawful for them to break, and yet is by no means lawful for them to keep; by which means they bring them&s;elves to this unhappy Cri&s;is, that they mu&s;t &s;in very greatly whether they keep or break their Vows, and have only the wretched Choice to make, which of two wicked Things they mu&s;t do.</P>

<P>It's very true, there's no Duty regarded on either Side; they were all Three from him, as I &s;aid before, for &s;ome time; and that which is the Sting of all is, that their not doing their Duty to him, is the Con&s;equence of his fir&s;t not doing his Duty to them; and &s;o he may &s;ee his Sin in the Puni&s;hment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, his Sin <HI>to them</HI> laid a Foundation of Sin <HI>in them</HI> too; that's another &s;ad Con&s;ideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and his Unkindne&s;s occa&s;ion'd their Unnaturalne&s;s; he turn'd them out of Doors, and they &s;taid out of his Doors; and &s;o they neither liv'd with him, or he with them; which was a me|lancholly thing among Father and Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it might be they were happier &s;o than if
<PB N="215" REF="224">
they were to have lived together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt; but it alienated the Minds of his Family, as I told you; he made him&s;elf a Terror to them fir&s;t; and how could they take delight in their Father, when he was perfectly made frightful to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of your Mind in that; if they were fir&s;t made to be &s;o afraid of him, they could &s;carce ever love him; I find it &s;o already in my own Family: <HI>Fear is a Species of Hatred,</HI> and will ri&s;e up to it by degrees; <HI>my Children</HI> are a coming up to it as fa&s;t as they can; and 'tis all my Fault originally, tho' it will be their Fault too at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have this Mercy, that they are young|er than his, and perhaps you may bring them off by a prudent Management of your Coun&s;el and Re|proof for the future.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOD knows whether this may not be too late; evil Impre&s;&s;ions take Root earlier and ea&s;ier than good; and I have a much harder Task to do now than it would have been, had I taken &s;uch a Cour&s;e as you have been &s;peaking of from the Be|ginning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be true; but you mu&s;t now ap|ply to it with the more &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and it may plea&s;e GOD to give his Ble&s;&s;ing to it &s;till; 'tis never too late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Neighbour, pray go on with your Story of Mr. &mdash;; for I know &s;omething of that unhap|py Man's Conduct too, and I think I begin to &s;ee him &s;et before me as a Warning for my own Man|nagement, tho' he brought it all back again after|wards, if my Account of it be right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you &s;hall hear that Part too in its place; but I &s;hall begin with the Story of one of his Sons fir&s;t; the Ca&s;e was this: The young Man had committed a Fault, <HI>that indeed he had;</HI> the Story of which will come in of cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="216" REF="225">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which of his Sons was it, for he has &s;everal; and I hear, he is out with them all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was his younge&s;t Son, who he bred up in his own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could it be? Had he robb'd him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I do not hear that he charg'd him with wronging him; but it was &s;ome Errand or Me&s;|&s;age which his Father order'd him to do, and the Lad had done it wrong; and he flew in a dreadful Pa&s;&s;ion upon him, beat him &s;everely, and in a too violent manner to be de&s;crib'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All <HI>Rage,</HI> all <HI>Rage,</HI> Neighbour; I &s;uppo&s;e, ju&s;t as you found me a doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but the Circum&s;tance makes it more pernicious even than yours, becau&s;e his Son was then almo&s;t a Man; and the Pa&s;&s;ions of Youth we all know are warm at that Time, and apt to precipitate them into fooli&s;h and ra&s;h Things; and &s;o it was here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As they are our own Children, we may expect they partake a little of our own Tempers; and I can &s;ee now, <HI>my Friend,</HI> &s;ince your Rea&s;onings have cool'd me, a great many Allowances which we ought to make to our Children, and for want of which we often hurt our own Peace, and ruin our Children effectually.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o it was here; after Mr. &mdash; had beaten his Son &s;o violently that he put the young Man into almo&s;t as great a Fury as him&s;elf, he bad him go to the Place again, which he had &s;ent him to before, and do the Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>right,</HI> which it &s;eems he had done <HI>wrong;</HI> the Youth, who&s;e ill Part was not begun till then, &s;at &s;till &s;obbing in his Brea&s;t; for he was in too much Rage to cry, and <HI>did not &s;tir.</HI> Upon which his Father bidding him again <HI>GO,</HI> he an&s;wer'd, <HI>he would not.</HI> The Father again provok'd at that, was taking up &s;omething to &s;trike him again;
<PB N="217" REF="226">
when his Son flying up on a &s;udden to go to the Door to run down Stairs, his Father &s;tep'd between and &s;top'd him: Upon which, being in the utmo&s;t Terror, he turns about, and in mere De&s;paration, runs to the Window, and jumps clear out a full Story high into the Street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are dreadful Examples of Pa&s;&s;ion in|deed, both in Father and Child; but the Youth was certainly in the Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not excu&s;ing the Children, when I am admoni&s;hing the Parent: <HI>I de&s;ire you will take that with you in all I &s;ay;</HI> GOD forbid I &s;hould &s;ay any thing to encourage the Di&s;obedience of Children; I hope you did not &s;ee any thing of it in what I &s;aid to you in your own Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I do not charge you with it; <HI>Pray go on with your Story;</HI> What came of the poor Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it &s;eems he got no capital Mi&s;chief by the Fall or Leap out of the Window; that is, he broke no Bone, tho' he hurt him&s;elf very much o|therwi&s;e; but getting up as well as he could, he went away to a Relation's Hou&s;e in the City; who &s;eeing him in that Condition, and hearing his Story, took him in, and took care of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what &s;aid the Father to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you might expect, <HI>as you are a Father,</HI> it might be &s;ome Surprize to him; but quite other|wi&s;e, <HI>which is very &s;trange;</HI> his Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o great, that he had no room to entertain any Apprehen&s;ions of what harm might have befallen his Child; but &s;eem'd rather vex'd that he had e&s;cap'd him, than troubl'd at his De&s;paration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a terrible In&s;tance indeed of the Ex|ce&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion; but how long did it hold? I &s;up|po&s;e when his Anger was over, it griev'd him in proportion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now, is the difference of Tem|per,
<PB N="218" REF="227">
between &s;ome Fathers and others; his Rage was &s;o great, that I know not whether it abated at all, or ever will abate; it was remov'd indeed from one Object to another, as you &s;hall hear at la&s;t; but I think it may be &s;aid to continue to be Rage even to &s;ome Years after: But to return to the Story. The Youth did not come home <HI>that Night</HI> you may be &s;ure, which very much di&s;appointed him; nor did he let his Father know where he was for &s;everal Days; for indeed he was &s;o brui&s;ed with his Fall or Leap, that he could not go abroad, and he was &s;o afraid his Fa|ther &s;hould come to him, that he was ready to &s;woon away at the very thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but after &s;ome time, I &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t abate a little?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall hear: There was a Relation of the Child's, <HI>(viz.) his Mother's Brother,</HI> who hearing of the Quarrel and the unhappy Circum&s;tances of it al&s;o, concern'd him&s;elf to make up the Breach, and to get the Father to be ea&s;y, and the young Man home again to his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was the Part of a true Friend, and like a religious Relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nei.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Succe&s;s did not an&s;wer at all; for when he came to the Father, and did <HI>but name him,</HI> he flew out in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and even abu&s;ed his Brother-in-Law for coming to him; falls a calling his Son all the Names a Man in a Rage could be &s;uppos'd to do; tells him, he had nothing to do but to keep out of his way, where-ever he happen'd to &s;ee him; that he had made a Vow that he &s;hould never come within his Doors again: &s;o that, in a word, there was no room for Interce&s;&s;ion of any kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was furious indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>His <HI>Brother-in-Law</HI> ask'd him what the Child mu&s;t do then? and expo&s;tulated with him upon the Di&s;tre&s;s of the young Man; argued his own Duty as
<PB N="219" REF="228">
a Parent; the Degree of his Son's Offence, the &s;in|fulne&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;aid all that could be &s;aid in the Ca&s;e, as a Relation and as a Chri&s;tian, but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be, he had &s;ome other great Crimes, or &s;ome unu&s;ual di&s;obliging Things to charge him with, which had &s;erv'd to exa&s;perate him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No;</HI> I do not find that he had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's true, his refu&s;ing to go again of the Er|rand, and telling his Father <HI>he would not,</HI> was pro|voking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>That's true;</HI> but where now is the Affecti|on of a Parent? where the Aim at the Child's Good, Soul and Body in all this? This is not Correction, 'tis meer Enmity, 'tis Wrath and Revenge; and this is the Rea&s;on why I told you this Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what is become of the young Man, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, when his Uncle had been with his Father, he came back to him; he did not tell him pre&s;ently how po&s;itively his Father had refu&s;ed to receive him; but began to per&s;wade him to go home, and &s;ubmit to his Father, as it was his Duty to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what &s;aid the Youth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>With Tears in his Eyes, <HI>he beg'd of his &V;n|cle</HI> that he might never go home to his Father any more, whatever Mi&s;chief befel him; he &s;aid, he would &s;ubmit to his Father, re&s;pect him, ask his Pardon, or any thing that could be rea&s;onably de|&s;ir'd; but that as his Father had no command of him&s;elf, no government of his Pa&s;&s;ions, he did not think he was qualify'd for the Government of his Children, and he would &s;ubmit to any Hard&s;hip in the World, but going home to his Father; <HI>but that</HI> he would never do what ever befel him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, this is a &s;ad Proof of the Con&s;e|quence
<PB N="220" REF="229">
of Father's letting loo&s;e their Pa&s;&s;ions in the government of their Families; but yet the Youth was wrong al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am now upon the Hi&s;tory, not the Comment, let me go on. When his Uncle found the Tempers on both &s;ides were &s;o entirely aver&s;e to one another, he mov'd no farther in it; but began to con|&s;ider what was to be done to prevent the Ruin of the young Man, which it &s;eems the Parent had no Con|cern about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that the Uncle was more a Father to him than his real Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true indeed, and has put him out again to the &s;ame Trade; which his Father knew, but took no more Notice of it or him, than if he was not his Child, or any way related to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was the young Man no other ways wicked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed; he is now a &s;ober, vertuous, and I hope, a religious young Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what will become of him when he is out of his Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that is the Thing we are now upon; did you not &s;ay you heard it was all made up again? That belongs to the other part of this Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well go on, I know not what the other Part may be; but this Part is all fierce, cruel, and un|natural.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I not &s;ay, that all Pa&s;&s;ion mingled with Correction, is unnatural?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would my violent Pa&s;&s;ion, think you, have run me up to &s;uch a dreadful Extream as this, if it had gone on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I &s;ee plainly it might; for as my Chil|dren were growing up, &s;o was my violent Mea&s;ures with them growing up al&s;o; and as I &s;hould have made them fear (that is, hate) me, <HI>for I take it to</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="230">
<HI>be the &s;ame;</HI> &s;o when they had provok'd me in this manner, I might have ripen'd up to the &s;ame Rage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope the Influence of &s;overaign Grace will re&s;train you from &s;uch Extreams; was not this Man's Family, and him&s;elf too, mi&s;erable by the&s;e Things! There were two other of his Children almo&s;t in the &s;ame Condition with him upon different Accounts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Account pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, his elde&s;t Daughter, a young Wo|man of a very good Character, a mode&s;t, &s;ober, re|ligious young Lady, had di&s;oblig'd him to the la&s;t Degree, much about the &s;ame time, becau&s;e &s;he would not marry <HI>a Fellow</HI> no way &s;uitable to her, either for Per&s;on or Manners; but one, who <HI>becau&s;e he was rich,</HI> the Father impo&s;ed upon her; &s;he us'd all the Arguments, all the Per&s;wa&s;ions and Entrea|ties &s;he could to her Father, to excu&s;e her from it; &s;he told him, &s;he could not love him, nay he was odious to her; &s;he could not endure him; &s;he re|pre&s;ented, that it would be a Sin in her, and an In|jury to the Man to marry him, &s;eeing &s;he could not love him, or di&s;charge her Duty as a Wife to him, in that Affection and Kindne&s;s that ought to be be|tween &s;uch Relations; <HI>all was one:</HI> She employ'd Friends to &s;peak to her Father and per&s;wade him, but all to no purpo&s;e; till at la&s;t he came upon her with Violence one Morning, and told her, he had &s;ent for Mr. &mdash;, <HI>meaning the Per&s;on he would have her to marry;</HI> and he was re&s;olv'd to &s;ee them mar|ry'd that Day.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, the Man's a Lunatick; &s;ure you can't call this a rea&s;onable Man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, his Daughter manag'd him better however than his Sons could do; for when &s;he &s;aw her Father warm, and reflected how ra&s;h he was in his Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;he made little an&s;wer, <HI>but in general,</HI> That &s;he hoped he would not force her to marry a|gain&s;t
<PB N="222" REF="231">
her Con&s;ent; that &s;he had given him an account already that &s;he could not marry that Per&s;on, and hoped he would not take it ill from her that &s;he could not do it. <HI>He minded little what &s;he &s;aid,</HI> but about Eleven a Clock brings the Per&s;on up to her, and leaves them together. The Man addre&s;s'd him&s;elf hand&s;omely enough to her: But &s;he, re&s;olving to take the occa&s;ion to extricate her&s;elf, told him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>That</HI> &s;he de&s;ir'd to be very plain with him, and hop'd he would not take it ill, &s;eeing there was a nece&s;&s;ity for it: <HI>That</HI> &s;he had &s;ome Rea&s;ons why &s;he could not comply with his De&s;ire; <HI>that</HI> &s;he hop'd he would not de&s;ire to marry her again&s;t her Will: <HI>That</HI> it was not any de&s;ign to affront him that &s;he u&s;ed this freedom with him; and <HI>that</HI> if her Father would have been plea&s;ed to do it for her, &s;he would gladly have been excu&s;ed, but &s;he had no other remedy; and if he had any real Re&s;pect for her, <HI>&s;he beg'd</HI> he would not urge her Father about it any more; for as it was her &s;ettled Re&s;olution never to have him his pre&s;&s;ing her Father to it was to no purpo&s;e as to the thing it &s;elf, and would only make a breach between her Father and her, which could be no Service to him; and with this &s;he related to him all that had pa&s;s'd between her Father and her.</Q></P>
<P>The Gentleman told her, he was was &s;urpriz'd to hear her talk &s;o, &s;eeing her Father had a&s;&s;ur'd him of another kind of Entertainment; But &s;ince it was &s;o, and &s;he was not to be prevail'd upon by Per&s;wa|&s;ion to alter her Mind, he a&s;&s;ur'd her, he was far from de&s;iring any violent Methods &s;hould be u&s;ed with her, and that he would be as careful not to exa&s;perate her Father again&s;t her, as po&s;&s;ible, and thus took his leave: He &s;aw her Father as he went out, <HI>but &s;aid little to him,</HI> only putting off his Hat as be pa&s;s'd by, the Father being talking with &s;omebody el&s;e.</P>
<P>It pa&s;s'd on for above an Hour without any Notice,
<PB N="223" REF="232">
the Father, it &s;eems, expecting the return of the Per&s;on; but when he &s;aw he came not, he came up to his Daughter and enquir'd the meaning of it; &s;he made no &s;cruple to tell her Father, That as &s;he had told him before, that &s;he could upon no Terms think of that Gentleman for a Husband, &s;he thought &s;he was oblig'd to tell him &s;o plainly too; for that &s;he could not think of keeping a Man Company, after &s;he re&s;olv'd not to have him.</P>
<P>Her Father interrupted her <HI>at that Word,</HI> but rather rav'd than talk'd to her, flying into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion as hardly to forbear his Hands from her; &s;aid all the un|kind rude Things to her he could think of; made &s;o|lemn Imprecations that he would never give her a Groat, that he would never own her for his Daugh|ter; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> bad her go out of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The young Woman you may be &s;ure was under great Affliction at this Treatment, but there was no remedy; it's true, &s;he did not go out of his Hou&s;e, but he neither Eat or Drank with her, would not &s;uffer her to come into the Room where he was, gave her neither Nece&s;&s;aries, Cloaths, or Money to buy them: Several Gentlemen made Propo&s;als to him to marry her, and &s;ome very hand&s;ome Offers; but he would neither entertain them, or make any of|fer in her behalf: If any Relation &s;poke to him of her, and offer'd to per&s;wade him, he an&s;wer'd, &s;he had di&s;oblig'd him, and he would have nothing to &s;ay to her.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure this cannot be Mr. &mdash; why it is not like a Man, 'tis all a kind of Barbari&s;m that I never heard the like of: It's a &s;ign the Mother of the&s;e poor Children is dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly when &s;he was alive it was not much better, for the Man was &s;o entirely given up to the impetuo&s;ity of his Pa&s;&s;ions, that there was no per|&s;wading him; but if once he was angred thoroughly,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray take the Aggravation with it <HI>(viz.)</HI> that 'tis all a Repre&s;entation of a pa&s;&s;ionate Father; for I keep to my Text, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that there is no room, nor can be any rea&s;on for Pa&s;&s;ion in a Father to his Chil|dren.

<P>Indeed I look upon my own Pa&s;&s;ions with Con|tempt too; for I think I have been as much to blame as Mr. &mdash;, and my Fury and Rage with my little Boy was as bruti&s;h and inhumane, and altogether as un|chri&s;tian as his too, with this Aggravation; that it began earlier, and might perhaps have been much wor&s;e by that Time my Children came to the Age of his.</P>

<P>What of his pa&s;&s;ionate Part?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, all pa&s;&s;ionate; and this was with his elde&s;t Son, with whom he had a wor&s;e Broil in its kind, than any of the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly that can hardly be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it run up to more Sin in the Son, and to a more fatal Unkindne&s;s in both, tho in the End it help'd to bring both to &s;ome &s;ight of their Folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray go on with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, his elde&s;t Son was a young Man of very promi&s;ing Parts, and an extraordinary Charact|er: As for the re&s;t of his Sons, <HI>for he has two more,</HI> who were then in his Favour; they were really worthle&s;s in their Qualifications, and the World ex|pected little from them, and indeed found little: As their Father was their Terror, when young, he was their Aver&s;ion when they were grown up; there was between them, neither Affection, Reverence, Du|ty or Society; they fear'd, and therefore hated him; they &s;hew'd evidently that they had a Contempt of his Conduct, only an Apprehen&s;ion of his Re&s;entment in point of Intere&s;t; and all this was the Effect of a furious, ab&s;olute, ra&s;h, pa&s;&s;ionate Conduct in his Fa|mily; the farther Effect of it you &s;hall &s;ee after|wards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but I long to hear the Story of the elde&s;t Son fir&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly the Ca&s;e of the Elde&s;t is &s;evere e|nough; for tho the young Man <HI>is in the Wrong ex|ceedingly,</HI> yet it is &s;o vi&s;ible a Judgment upon his Fa|ther, that, as I &s;aid, he may really read his Sin in his Puni&s;hment: The young Man was bred in a gentlemanly Manner by him, only with this Diffe|rence, that he was always &s;o ab&s;olute a Tyrant in his
<PB N="226" REF="235">
Family, and made him&s;elf &s;o terrible by his Pa&s;&s;ions, among his Children, that it could &s;carce be expected he &s;hould ever have any Comfort in any of them; for he never taught them any Obedience but that of Slaves, I mean the Obedience of Fear; and this made them naturally Di&s;repectful to their Father, when they came to be remov'd out of the Reach of that Fear; and tho this could not be, without manife&s;t Breach of Duty in the Children, yet the Father had great Cau&s;e to reflect upon him&s;elf, and to reverence the Ju&s;tice of that Providence which made his own unlawful Pa&s;&s;ions, as a Father, be the real Cau&s;e of the &s;inful Di&s;obedience of his Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray let me hear the particular Ca&s;e, be|cau&s;e I have heard the Father wonderfully blam'd on his Account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own the Father is to be blam'd, but the Son al&s;o is inexcu&s;able; and I am the warmer upon that Head, becau&s;e I know the Example is dange|rous in its Nature; and if the Crime is not truly repre&s;ented with the Fact, Children are but too apt to &s;et the la&s;t up for an Example, without enquiring into the fir&s;t. It is a certain Rule, and all &s;ober re|ligious Children will adhere to and acknowledge it, that tho the Parent may fail of his Duty to his Child, yet that by no means di&s;pen&s;es with the Duty of a Child, becau&s;e the Child's Obedience is not found|ed upon the Father's Conduct, but upon the Laws of Nature. A Son can never argue that the breach of Duty in his Father is a Super&s;edeas to his Obliga|tion: Obedience of Children to Parents is a natu|ral Law; 'tis a fir&s;t Principle, neither Humanity or Chri&s;tianity can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it; nor can any Defect in the Conduct of the Father di&s;charge that Duty; for this Rea&s;on I think this Per&s;on's Son inexcu&s;ably to blame, whatever his Father's Conduct was; and, at the &s;ame Time, that we mu&s;t condemn the Father's
<PB N="227" REF="236">
ungovern'd Pa&s;&s;ion, every good Man mu&s;t dete&s;t the Treatment of him by his Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then perhaps you have had a different Ac|count of it from what I heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ure my Account is right, becau&s;e I have heard both Sides. The young Man had a de|&s;ire to Marry a certain Lady, whom he had lov'd for &s;ome Years. The Father ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give his Con&s;ent, and charges him upon his Duty not to do it. The young Man tells him he will obey him, &s;ince he is &s;o ab&s;olute, tho he thinks it very hard, and &s;u&s;pecting his Father de&s;ign'd another for him, who he did not like; he adds to his Father, that if he will not let him have her he de&s;ign'd to have, he is re|&s;olv'd he never will have any Body el&s;e, and that he will not Marry at all.</P>
<P>This enraged the Father to that degree, that he flew out into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion at his Son; told him he would renounce his Relation to him, that he would have nothing to do with as long as he liv'd; that he would not own him to be his Son, and that, if he beg'd his Bread, he &s;hould not come to him for Relief; for if he did, he would charge a Con|&s;table with him, and &s;end him to the Hou&s;e of Cor|rection; and bid him go out of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Son, as he &s;aid, afterwards, <HI>for he repented of this Ra&s;hne&s;s of his Temper,</HI> inheriting a Share of the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion from his Father, <HI>was &s;o provoked too,</HI> that, according to his Father's Command, he remov'd the next Day in a formal Manner from his Father's Hou&s;e with all his Books, for he was a Scholar, and whatever he call'd his own. His Father, continu|ing in his Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;earch'd his Boxes or Trunks, as if he had been a Thief; told him he did well to remove voluntarily, that he might not be o|blig'd to kick him out of Doors; that he would entertain no &s;uch Rebel in his Family, tho every
<PB N="228" REF="237">
Child he had was to turn out in the &s;ame manner; and added &s;ome &s;uch violent and opprobious Words to him, that at la&s;t the young Man grew as outra|gious as his Father, and gave him very rude and indecent Language too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a &s;ad height for Things to be brought to between a Father and a Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o, and both gave Cau&s;e to be a&s;ham'd of it, and above all of the Occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but pray go on with what the Son &s;aid to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the Afternoon, and the Son's Pa&s;&s;i|on was a little abated, tho the Father's was not: He had &s;ent away all his Things, and was ju&s;t going <HI>ci|villy</HI> to have bid his Father farewel; when the Fa|ther, continuing his Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid &s;omething to him very di&s;honourable of his Mother, and this rai&s;ed his Pa&s;&s;ion again; whereupon he told him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He had liv'd under his Tyranny, <HI>for Government he could not call it,</HI> 22 Years, and had never willingly done any thing to di&s;oblige him; <HI>That</HI> he had always been treated as his Brothers and Si&s;ters were, in a manner that was a Shame to him to mention; <HI>but that</HI> now he was u&s;ed &s;o (e&s;pecially in this Ca&s;e of his Mother, who was in her Grave, and could not vindicate her &s;elf) as he could bear it no longer, &s;o was o|blig'd to tell him, <HI>That</HI> it was a Deliverance to him to e&s;cape from his Inhumanity, and that he de&s;erv'd not the Name of a Father, but rather of a wild Creature, that no one &s;hould be &s;ubject to: <HI>That</HI> what was his Mother's Jointure he expected in its Time, but would not acknowledge it to him, be|cau&s;e he had defam'd his Mother, who&s;e Shoes he was not worthy to carry after her: <HI>That</HI> as for his E&s;tate, he relinqui&s;h'd it freely, for he believ'd a Cur&s;e attended it, and he de&s;ir'd none of it &s;hould mingle with his own: <HI>That</HI> from thence forward
<PB N="229" REF="238">
he di&s;own'd him for a Father, and took upon him to tell him, that in a few Years he would not have a Child left but what would abhor him, and be a&s;ham'd of him: <HI>That</HI> he had given him no ju&s;t Cau&s;e to treat him as he had done now, &s;o he would put it out of his Power to do it again: <HI>That</HI> for his Family, he wi&s;h'd for his own &s;ake he might repent of ruining his younge&s;t Son, abu&s;ing his elde&s;t, and murthering his Daughter, <HI>for the young Woman was by that Time in a deep Con&s;umption, having ju&s;t as it were broken her Heart with grief for her Father's &V;&s;age of her;</HI> and he did not doubt but in a little Time he would have the Ruin of more of his Children to an&s;wer for.</Q></P>
<P>The Father was terribly a&s;toni&s;h'd at his Son's Words, and &s;aying not one Word to him, his Son left him, and went entirely away from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the dreadfulle&s;t Story that ever I heard in my Life: Is it po&s;&s;ible that any Behaviour of a Father can ju&s;tify &s;uch Carriage in a Son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I am not upon ju&s;tifying it, but relating it; and I tell you that the Son, who prov'd afterwards a very &s;ober, pious and religious Per|&s;on, acknowledg'd the Crime of it, and wrote his Father a Letter, to beg his Pardon for it; not but that he in&s;i&s;ted even in his Letter, upon the Cruelty and Inhumanity of his Father's Con|duct; but own'd, he ought to have born with the Provocation, by the Ties of his Duty; that he ought not to have &s;uffer'd his Pa&s;&s;ion to have carry'd him into any indecent or undutiful Language; and there|fore thought him&s;elf obliged to ask him forgivene&s;s for that Part. And the U&s;e I make of it, and the Rea&s;on why I tell you the Story is this; that with|out doubt it was a terrible Judgment upon the pa&s;&s;io|nate government of a Father, and he found it &s;o af|terward: and it may teach Parents what wicked Things they may have rea&s;on to fear from their Chil|dren,
<PB N="230" REF="239">
if they take Mea&s;ures with them in their Edu|cation, which &s;o nece&s;&s;arily brings their Children to hate and de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, and I de&s;ire to bring it all <HI>home to my &s;elf;</HI> and if I have not gone too far already, I will, with GOD's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, bani&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion out of all my Family-Government; for I have Children will do ju&s;t &s;o, <HI>if I go on,</HI> I am &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is partly upon this Account I tell you this Story; for 'tis a &s;ad Ca&s;e, when our Children are led to break in upon their Duty to us, by our fir&s;t being wanting in our Duty to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But harkye, as I told you before, I have heard, that my Neighbour Mr. &mdash; has &s;een a great deal of this Folly in the&s;e Things, and has alter'd his Conduct and his Family too, &s;ince all this happen'd. Now if you know the bright &s;ide of his Story as well as the dark Side, pray let me know it too; for there is certainly as much Profit in the Relation of the Repentance, as there can be in the Story of the Offence; and it would be &s;omething unju&s;t to leave his Family Hi&s;tory in the Form of a Tragedy, when it has plea&s;ed GOD to re&s;tore them, and heal the di&s;|mal Breaches the&s;e furious Pa&s;&s;ions have made, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I am of your Opinion in that, nor do I love to relate a Story with a dark Side only; it is a more ble&s;&s;ed Work to tell of the Mercies of GOD to Families and Per&s;ons, than of their Breaches and Crimes; I think <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Regain'd</HI> a plea&s;anter Work, tho' it may not have &s;o much va|riety in it, than his <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> at lea&s;t there is a greater Beauty in the Subject.</P>

<P>In that you go again&s;t the common Opinion.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> him&s;elf was of my Opinion.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know the Rea&s;on he gave, why the
<PB N="231" REF="240">
World lik'd the fir&s;t Part better than the la&s;t? He &s;aid the Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e they had <HI>a Sen&s;e</HI> of the Lo&s;s; but <HI>no Ta&s;te</HI> of the Recovery. But this is by the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, 'tis very well to our purpo&s;e; for I a&s;|&s;ure you, tho the di&s;mal part of Mr. &mdash;'s Ca&s;e has been very &s;uitable to me, who was running on blind|ly in the very &s;ame Mea&s;ures with my Family; yet the merciful Providences which afterwards occurr'd in his Family, and which, as I hear, has given a Turn to his Management, as well as to the Children's Duty, will be both plea&s;ant and profitable too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I cannot &s;ay but there is &s;omething Tragical even in the brighte&s;t Part of his Family; for his unhappy Conduct fir&s;t or la&s;t, made every Child he had embroil them&s;elves with him: in &s;ome, he was not in the Right, and in others, they were more in the Wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but pray enter into the Particulars, if you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may remember I told you he had two Sons more; and I added, that they were in them|&s;elves <HI>worthle&s;s Creatures,</HI> and &s;o you will &s;oon find they were, at lea&s;t one of them: You mu&s;t note, the Father being thus di&s;gu&s;ted at the Three I have told you of, began to carry it with more familiarity and ea&s;ine&s;s to the re&s;t, and &s;eem'd to court them as much as he had oppre&s;s'd the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often &s;een it &s;o, where Partiality in Af|fection guides the Parents; and almo&s;t as often &s;een, that tho&s;e Children return it ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So indeed it was here; the Elde&s;t of the two, who was at Man's E&s;tate, di&s;cover'd evidently the utmo&s;t Contempt of his Father upon all Occa&s;i|ons; and on the other hand, the Father, after the Quar|rel with his other Children, turned &s;o fooli&s;hly fond and wrapt up in this Son, that it was as &s;candalous an
<PB N="232" REF="241">
Extream on the other, and was a Judgment on him no doubt; he would bear every thing from him, imagine every thing he did was well, and hear no|thing again&s;t him; and in a word, fell in &s;o with this Son, that it came up to Dotage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's an Ab&s;urdity on the other hand, which I hope I &s;hall never come to be Fool enough for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had this Son known how to have manag'd his Intere&s;t politically, he might have ruin'd all the re&s;t of the Family; for the Father gave up him&s;elf and his Affairs, in a manner, into his Hand, tru&s;ted him with all he had; and had he died under that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for I think it was little better, would, I believe, have given him the be&s;t Part of it all, with|out regard to the Di&s;tre&s;s of his other Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope this violent Humour did not la&s;t,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was happy for the Family, that this Son prov'd otherwi&s;e than his Father expected, or they had been all undone: In a word, he prov'd the un|gratefulle&s;t Wretch to his Father that ever could be imagin'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, <HI>be his Father's Conduct what it would to the re&s;t,</HI> he was it &s;eems a kind Father to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>He regarded none of it; he impiou&s;ly own'd, that he lo&s;t all re&s;pect for his Father when he was a Boy; that his Father had us'd him &s;o like a Dog when he was young, that he could never love him, or have any Affection for him as long as he liv'd; nay, he was come to &s;uch a height, that he would tell his Father &s;o to his Face, and give him the mo&s;t opprobrious Language, and make the mo&s;t &s;candalous Reflections upon him in his hearing, even to the making a Je&s;t and Reproach of his own Father, and in his Family too. And yet &s;uch a <HI>tame Creature</HI> was this furious Father become in the Ca&s;e of this Wretch that thus in&s;ulted him, that he would bear it all; and that with a meanne&s;s, as far below the
<PB N="233" REF="242">
Authority and Dignity of a Parent, as his Pa&s;&s;ions before had been above the Calmne&s;s and Temper of a Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This mu&s;t be a Judgment upon him indeed; &s;ure never Man run into two &s;uch contrary Ex|treams: why, it was no more his Duty to bear &s;uch Treatment, than it was his Duty to correct with &s;uch Violence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you that readily: Every Parent ought to pre&s;erve the Dignity and Authority of his Station; otherwi&s;e, neither his In&s;tructions or Com|mands receive the ju&s;t Force, or make the due Im|pre&s;&s;ion which they ought to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to bear &s;uch In&s;ults as tho&s;e you &s;peak of, de&s;troys all &s;ubordination, which is the mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential Part of Government; and his Hou&s;e could no more be called a Family, but a Bedlam; be&s;ides; 'tis a horrible thing in its Nature.</P>
</SP>

<P>You are very right, and I tell it you as &s;uch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine was an Extream, but this is an Extream of a different Nature; pray how will you direct any Man to bear &s;uch Treatment, and how &s;hall a Fa|ther do to govern his Pa&s;&s;ion in &s;uch a Ca&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, tho that be a Digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall &s;peak to it before I go any farther, by telling a &s;hort Story of another Acquaintance of mine, who has two Sons at this Time of very different Age; but both in their Degree, guilty of the &s;ame Crime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And perhaps the Younger, &s;poil'd by the Ex|ample of the Elder, as I have known to be the Ca&s;e oftentimes in the Compa&s;s of my Acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Friend was a good Man, but in the Conduct of his Family, fell into the contrary Ex|tream to what we have been talking of; for being an indulgent fond Father, he, like <HI>good old E L I,</HI> let his Sons run on, at lea&s;t uncorrected, if not unre|prov'd;
<PB N="234" REF="243">
till &s;ome of them not knowing how to ma|nage them&s;elves under &s;o much Lenity, took the Li|berty from it to grow upon their Father, and u&s;e him very &s;curvily upon many Occa&s;ions.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old way, I &s;uppo&s;e, of riding upon the &s;oft Di&s;po&s;ition, and abu&s;ing the Goodne&s;s of their Father; which &s;hould rather have mov'd them, and engag'd them to a return of Duty and Affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's very true; they began to treat their Father with the greate&s;t Slight and Contempt, even to laugh at him when he directed any thing this way or that; and tell him, it was better &s;o or &s;o, and they would do it their own way.</P>
</SP>

<P>They &s;aw their Father a Fool, I &s;uppo&s;e, or they would never have gone that Length with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their Father was no Fool I a&s;&s;ure you; nor was it either Ignorance of his Duty, or want of Spirit to make him&s;elf be obey'd; but his Affection to his Children was his Snare; he had made him&s;elf their Play-fellow and their Companion, and could nor, bear the thoughts of differing with them, but cho&s;e rather to bear their want of Re&s;pect to him, till indeed it came up to Indecency.</P>

<P>A Child is &s;eldom grown &s;o old in his Fa|ther's Life-time, but a Father may find &s;ome way or other to re&s;ent his Di&s;re&s;pect; and &s;o it was here. The younge&s;t of the&s;e two Sons had committed a Fault which was in its Nature provoking, but was made ten times wor&s;e, by giving &s;aucy and unduti|ful Language to his Father when he came to en|quire into it: He was but a Youth, and one that ought to have been under Family Government; but he had, it &s;eems, a Haunt among &s;ome ill Company, which his Father had with great Tenderne&s;s, per|&s;waded
<PB N="235" REF="244">
him again&s;t; Now he had nor only been with them, but had &s;tay'd out two Nights together.</P>

<P>When he came home, his Father, <HI>like old Eli,</HI> began calmly with <HI>a nay, my Son, but it is no good Report that I hear;</HI> I mean, he talk'd kindly and tenderly to the Boy: But he &s;oon found rea&s;on to alter his Tone and his Conduct too; not with the young One only, but with his Elde&s;t al&s;o, who put him&s;elf into the Broil of his own accord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's often &s;o, that when our elde&s;t Children grow pa&s;t government, they drag up the re&s;t after them, who think they may in&s;ult their Parents by the Authority of the Example; and that what a Pa|rent bears from one, he mu&s;t bear from all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I &s;hall therefore &s;hew you here the Patern of a Father; who tho he had erred in the fir&s;t Part of his Conduct, I mean, in treating his Chil|dren too tenderly; yet when he found them abu&s;e that Tenderne&s;s, and break the Bounds of their Duty, knew how to re&s;ent it as he ought in the Elde&s;t, and to correct it as he ought in the Other.</P>

<P>After he had talk'd kindly to his Son a while, and repre&s;ented to him the Evil Con&s;equence of &s;uch Cour&s;es; he ask'd him, <HI>where he had been?</HI> The Boy would give no An&s;wer a good while to him:

<P>Well, he had a greater Tryal for his Pa|tience yet; he left his Son, and went away into a Clo&s;et on the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e.

<P>This proves that our Affection to our Chil|dren, and the Expre&s;&s;ions of it in all the Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s, that attends the milde&s;t Temper, is yet very con&s;i&s;tent with, and no ob&s;truction to the Duty of a &s;trict Re&s;traint of their Follies, and a due correct|ing them when their Ob&s;tinacy makes it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>In conjunction with this Rebel, his other Son (and the la&s;t we have to &s;peak of) became a meer Rake, a common Scandal in his Morals, and extravagant to the la&s;t Degree. The two Sons held together, and be|came Companions as well in their Vices as in their Behaviour to their Father; and to &s;uch a degree of Stupidity did they bring him, that, in a word, they dipp'd deep into his Ca&s;h to &s;upport their Ex|travagancies: The younge&s;t had the keeping of his trading Ca&s;h; and it happen'd one Day, that his Fa|ther looking over his Ca&s;h-Book, to &s;ee if there was Money enough to an&s;wer &s;ome Payment he had to make, found the Ca&s;h-Book not ballanc'd, or made up, and call'd his younger Son to make it up. His Son put him off for that Time. In a Day or two more he tells his Son he wants &s;uch a Sum of Mo|ney; his Son tells him he has not &s;o much in Bank. No, &s;ays his Father, how much have you? He an|&s;wer'd him &s;urlily, he did not know. Well, &s;ays his Father, go make it up and let me know. He &s;huffl'd it off a good while, till his Father began to be out of Humour; for he could be angry with him, tho he could not with the elde&s;t: However, to be &s;hort, the Ca&s;e was, that the elde&s;t had confederated with the other &s;o far as to get about 600 <HI>l.</HI> of his Fa|ther's Money away, and when it could be conceal'd no longer, he runs away from him.</P>

<P>That's true; he was in a con&s;tant Rage, his Pa&s;&s;ions, like the Sea, had been di&s;turb'd by a vio|lent Storm, and the Waves continu'd their Motion by the meer Influence of their own Weight, tho the Cau&s;e was at an end.</P>

<P>Such Pa&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, are of a &s;tronger and more violent Nature than others, becau&s;e they &s;ink deeper in the Mind, and &s;hould be therefore &s;hun'd with the greater Care, as they are capable of wor&s;e Events than other Di&s;turbances of the Mind.</P>

<P>This, Si&s;ter, and my Father's Treatment of me, has given me a &s;ad Heart for &s;ome Time; I know I have been out of Government, and run into a great many fooli&s;h and wicked Cour&s;es: the Truth is, my Father's Pa&s;&s;ions made &s;uch a terrible Work among us always, that I hated the Hou&s;e; and, <HI>like a Fool,</HI> to make my &s;elf ea&s;y, run out of one Mi&s;chief into another, and my Brother led me by the Hand into the wor&s;t Cour&s;es; and thus I have ruin'd my &s;elf, both Soul and Body.</P>

<P>I re&s;olve, GOD willing, to live quite ano|ther Life; my Father has taught me more by his un|govern'd Pa&s;&s;ion, and ill-guided Affection, than ever he taught me by In&s;truction in his Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Brother, my Father's Weakne&s;s &s;hould be our Affliction; I am &s;ure it is mine, and may be in&s;tructing many ways to us: GOD has many ways to teach and bring us to a Sen&s;e of our Duty that we do not think of; natural Affection bids us Pity and Pray for our Father, and yet Duty and the Laws of GOD, bid us learn to avoid the Follies he may be guilty of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Si&s;ter, I never lov'd my Father before; I mu&s;t own, I hated and de&s;pi&s;ed him always till now; I thought his furious Pa&s;&s;ions were bruti&s;h and unnatural; his Treatment of us who were his own
<PB N="251" REF="262">
Children, unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t; that he did not u&s;e us like Chri&s;tians, much le&s;s like Chil|dren; and that I was under no Obligations of Duty and Re&s;pect to him, for that very rea&s;on. But now I come to &s;ee this unnatural Carriage of my Brother, I &s;ee likewi&s;e my own Follies and Madne&s;s in other Things; I &s;ee it in that too, that I &s;hould think, becau&s;e my Father is but a Man and &s;ubject to violent Pa&s;&s;ions, and perhaps &s;uch as I may think Unju&s;t, that therefore I mu&s;t be a Bea&s;t, and with|draw my Affection from him that gave me Being; That becau&s;e my Father is not a Saint, therefore I mu&s;t be a Devil: My Notion of the&s;e Things there|fore, Si&s;ter, are quite chang'd; I pity my Father's Infirmities, I am &s;orry for his Provocations, and love him in a different Manner now from what I under|&s;tood before. On the other hand, I think my Bro|ther's Conduct the mo&s;t to be abhor'd of all that I ever met with; and I doubt not, but he will repent it, with a &s;ad Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h it may not be too late; for I mu&s;t own to you Brother, &s;uch Carriage to our Parents is a Sin that I think is oftner puni&s;h'd in this World than any other, and is oftner confe&s;s'd at the Gallows than any where el&s;e.</P>

<P>That is true Si&s;ter, and that very thing has not fail'd to lie upon my Thoughts I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Brother, I did not &s;peak with any Thoughts to you; my Brother has gone a length that you never went, and it's evident I cannot reach your Ca&s;e; for GOD be prais'd, you are confe&s;&s;ing it early; and early Repentance is a peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Si&s;ter, there goes a great deal more than mo&s;t People think of to a true and &s;incere Repen|tance; and one thing is, to make Acknowledgment to the Per&s;ons injur'd; I would, with all my Heart, ac|knowledge all my undutiful, di&s;re&s;pectful Carriage to my Father; but he is of &s;uch a Temper, that he
<PB N="252" REF="263">
is not capable to receive &s;uch an Acknowledgment; if I &s;hould ask him Pardon, he would but Je&s;t at it, and &s;corn me, and perhaps refu&s;e it, and cur&s;e me; I am in &s;uch a &s;trait I know not what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, you &s;ay you gave my Father no Pro|vocation now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, no, I do not mean this; I have nothing to ask Pardon for in this, for I gave not the lea&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence, much le&s;s did I give any Cau&s;e for &s;uch bitter Words: But I &s;peak of all the formen Part of our Conduct, when my Brother u&s;ed to in|&s;ult him, and I too; I am &s;en&s;ible it was the wicked|e&s;t Thing I could be able to do, let my Father's Con|duct be what it will; and I remember that terrible Scripture with many a terrible Reproach upon my &s;elf, <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that &s;etteth light by his Father and Mother:</HI> This is what I would ask him Pardon for; but there is no doing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Brother, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD he will for|give upon Terms on which Men refu&s;e to forgive: Ask GOD Pardon, and wait the I&s;&s;ue of his Provi|vidence, he can turn my Father's Heart, and no doubt will open a Door for you to &s;how the Return of your Duty to him, and bring my Father to be &s;en|&s;ible of and accept it.</P>

<P>But Si&s;ter, what &s;hall we do about this ra&s;h, fooli&s;h Creature my Brother?

<P>The good Man was touch'd with this Di&s;cour&s;e, and it brought Tears into his Eyes; and the good Woman taking this Opportunity, mov'd him to talk with his Daughter; laid before him how hard a Thing it was to carry it &s;o &s;everely &s;o long together, to a Child that never offended him; and arguing calmly with him the Ca&s;e of his Daughter, prevail'd upon him, to have her come up to him: When &s;he came to his Bed-&s;ide, he took her in his Arms and ki&s;s'd her, but could very hardly &s;peak to her, and &s;he much le&s;s to him for &s;ome Time; however, at length he told her he de&s;ir'd &s;he would be faithful in one Thing to him. His Daughter told him, &s;he would be faith|ful to him in every Thing that ever &s;he was entru&s;t|ed with; that nothing had ever gone &s;o near her Heart as having offended him; and that &s;he wanted

The good old Woman took this Opportunity of the good Di&s;po&s;ition he was in, to repre&s;ent to him how much happier both he and his whole Family would be, in this Chri&s;tian dutiful engaging Treatment of one another, than in continual Breaches and Di&s;contents; and particularly pre&s;s'd him to con&s;ider how &s;inful, as well as how mi&s;chievous to his Family, his own violent Pa&s;&s;ions had been, and in particular how far they had conbributed to the Di&s;a&s;ters of his Fa|mily, and the Di&s;orders of his Children, tho their Di&s;obedience was to be laid at their own Door al&s;o. He bore it with much more Temper than &s;he expected; and told her, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, he was very &s;en&s;ible, that his ungovern'd Pa&s;&s;ion in the Conduct of his Children, <HI>e&s;pecially when they were young,</HI> had laid the Foundation of all the re&s;t; that it had de&s;troy'd the Affection of his Children, and brought them from a filial Fear of di&s;plea&s;ing him, to a Slave-like Terror at his being di&s;plea&s;ed, which were two very great Extreams.</P>
<P>Why, truly, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the pious Woman,</HI> if I may be &s;o free, and <HI>none of your Children being pre&s;ent to hear me,</HI> I fear it has; and 'tis a hard Matter for Children to think that their Pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould have no room in their Conduct, as well as their Parents. And that, as your Son <HI>James</HI> &s;aid <HI>very religiou&s;ly,</HI> a Father's omitting his Duty gives no Allowance to the Son to fail in his Re&s;pect: 'Tis true, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> Children ought not to fail in their Duty, on pretence of the Mi&s;carriages of their Parents; <HI>but it is true al&s;o,</HI> that few Children have &s;o much Regard to their Parents, or Sen&s;e of their Duty, as to con&s;ider it; and there|fore, <HI>adds the good Woman,</HI> Parents &s;hould be very careful that they do not, by their Pa&s;&s;ions, put Ex|cu&s;es into the Mouths of their Children, and Argu|ments to rea&s;on them out of their Duty.</P>

<P>Here the good Woman took an Opportunity to &s;peak to him of his two other Sons; but there being no room for running back too far at that Time, &s;he let it alone for the pre&s;ent, but never gave it over, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their penitent Son, till the Fa|ther was reconcil'd to them all; nor did it take up much Time, for &s;he follow'd her Di&s;cour&s;e, not only with religious Arguments, but with earne&s;t Per&s;wa|&s;ions, till &s;he brought him to be very willing to re|ceive them; and &s;he u&s;ed the &s;ame Earne&s;tne&s;s to per&s;wade the Children, and to convince them that it was their Duty to &s;ubmit to their Father, tho they were in the right. Thus &s;he happily brought about a perfect Reconciliation, and they are now a very comfortable, plea&s;ant Family; and I hear &s;ince, that even that wicked Creature, that u&s;ed his Father &s;o ill, has &s;ent over very penitent Letters from <HI>Jamaica, where it &s;eems he went,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing his Sen&s;e of his In|gratitude to, and horrid Treatment of his Father, and begging him to forgive him.</P>

<P>Yes, indeed, and that in &s;uch a Manner as few Servants ever were; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I believe, if all Servants in &s;uch Places did their Duty like her, it would &s;pread Religion thro' the World in a &s;ecret and imperceptible Manner, for ought I know, equal to all other Means that GOD has appointed for it.</P>

<HEAD>The Third DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Gentlelman having in the foregoing Dia|logue, promis'd to give his Friend, at their next Meeting, the Story of a faithful religi|ous Maid-Servant, the Father was very im|patient to hear it; and accordingly being met, as by their Appointment, the next Night his Friend began the following Relation, embelli&s;h'd with a great many u&s;eful Digre&s;&s;ions, all fit to be apply'd the &s;ame Way.</P>
<P>There was a Family, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> in the Out Part of the City, of whom it may be &s;aid, they were as odly circum&s;tanc'd for the Production of any thing proper to this Work, as any Family could be imagin'd to be.</P>
<P>They were of middling Circum&s;tances as to Wealth, not con&s;iderably Rich, and yet far from Poor: The Father was of an Employment in one of the publick Offices belonging to Sea-Affairs, which, in the Na|ture
<PB N="265" REF="276">
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, brought abundance of Compa|ny continually to his Hou&s;e, and that too, Company of the wor&s;t Sort, as to Sobriety and Mode&s;ty, as well in Words and Ge&s;tures as ordinary Behaviour: This had a very unhappy Effect upon the Behaviour of his Children, made his Daughters bold and for|ward, and his Sons wicked; and even familiar with Vice, as &s;uch &s;ort of People mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>The Family was as void of Religion, as it is po&s;&s;i|ble to &s;uppo&s;e a Family can be in a Country where any thing of Religion is nationally profe&s;t. Their Con|ver&s;ation was &s;o far from being religious, that it was &s;carce Sober; perfectly Prophane and Loo&s;e; nothing of the Practi&s;e of Religion, no, not &s;o much as the Show of it; for either Father or Mother were hard|ly ever known to go to Church, from one End of the Year to t'other.</P>
<P>The Sabbath-Day was generally among them a Day of Company and Diver&s;ion, and they &s;eldom din'd alone; after Dinner the Time was generally &s;pent in drinking by the Father, and either in &s;leep or walking in the Fields by the Mother and Daugh|ters: Now and then, by accident, or as Company came in and propo&s;ed it, the Children might perhaps go to Church, but very &s;eldom.</P>
<P>Their Di&s;cour&s;e, as the Conver&s;ation of &s;uch Fa|milies generally is, was a meer Complication of Le|vity and Vanity, to &s;ay no wor&s;e; a Collection of ill Language, Oaths, taking the Name of GOD in vain, and all kinds of loo&s;e, leud, and wicked Talk.</P>
<P>They had a Hou&s;e full of Children, having no le&s;s than four Daughters and five Sons, and they were mo&s;t of them grown up to be near Men and Women, except one Son and one Daughter; the Son was a|bout three or four Years old, and the Daughter &s;ix; and it can hardly be doubted but the Children were all of them following after their Father and Mother,
<PB N="266" REF="277">
as fa&s;t as it could be imagin'd Children &s;hould, who had no other kind of Education than the wicked Ex|ample of their Parents.</P>
<P>The little Son was ju&s;t entring upon the Stage of Life; could talk, and run about and play with Neigh|bours Children, which came to the Hou&s;e. His Mo|ther caus'd him at fir&s;t to be carry'd to School Morn|ing and Afternoon, rather to be out of the Way, than that they &s;uppos'd he could learn much &s;o young.</P>
<P>It was a little &s;en&s;ible Child for its Age, and ma|ny little remarkable Di&s;coveries of its being more than ordinarily &s;o, were every Day made by its Acti|ons and Di&s;cour&s;es; which the Mother, tho a Wo|man perfectly void of all Capacity of making ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations from that Parents, yet, as Parents often|times tire us with telling long Stories of the For|wardne&s;s of their Children, when there's little or nothing extraordinary in them; &s;o it was here; his Mother, who was mighty fond of this Boy, was con|tinually telling People one &s;imple Story or another of the extraordinary Wit, cunning Que&s;tions, and apt An&s;wers of this Child; tho perhaps, at that Time, little more than what was common. It was one Day, when, upon &s;ome particular Occa&s;ion, they had an Entertainment of &s;ome Friends in the Hou&s;e, that after Dinner the Mother was making her &s;elf merry with this little Boy's Prattle, and asking him a great many little Que&s;tions, to divert her &s;elf and the Company; and the Boy as inqui&s;itive as &s;he, ask'd many little Que&s;tions too, not much to the Purpo&s;e, but &s;ufficient to &s;et the Mother, and tho&s;e about it, a laughing, which was all the Mother wanted.</P>
<P>There was a plain, rough, hone&s;t and &s;ober Man among the Company, a Captain of a Ship; and he not &s;eeing &s;o much Je&s;t in the Matter as the Woman made of it, the Mother was a little tart upon him, and told him, &s;he &s;uppos'd he was none of the fond
<PB N="267" REF="278">
Fathers: <HI>Yes, he was,</HI> he &s;aid; <HI>but he did not &s;ee the Jest was worth &s;o much Laugh.</HI> Ju&s;t at that Moment the Child &s;aid &s;omething, or ask'd the Mother &s;ome Que&s;tion or other, that pleas'd the Company mightily. Why, Captain, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> was not that a &s;trange Que|&s;tion for a Child of three Years old? Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> that is not all my Objection; but, if I may be plain with you, methinks the Child asks wi&s;er Que&s;tions than its Mother, pray why don't you ask him fitter Que&s;tions? O dear! <HI>&s;ays the Mother,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you would have me ask him, who made him: He will learn his Catechi&s;e when he comes to Church. <HI>Says the Captain blantly,</HI> If he don't learn it at Church till his Mother carries him thither, it may be late enough. It's no great matter, <HI>&s;ays &s;he (with an Air of Prophanene&s;s)</HI> whether ever he goes there or no; there's no great lo&s;s in it. Like Mother, like Son, <HI>&s;ays the Captain, je&s;ting, but yet a little rough,</HI> he's in a fair Way to be a hopeful Man with &s;uch Educa|ting. He may &s;erve, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> for a Sea Captain; he may &s;oon have Religion enough for a <HI>Tarpaulin.</HI> Yes, Madam, <HI>replies the Captain;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you'll teach him to &s;wear by the Compa&s;s. The Boy look'd ear|ne&s;tly upon the Captain, while he was &s;peaking, and without any He&s;itation, &s;ays very gravely to him, <HI>I won't &s;wear.</HI> The Captain was affected with what the Child &s;aid, and particularly with the Manner of his &s;peaking of it; for on a &s;uddain the Child turn'd from his Mirth, and look'd as &s;erious and &s;urly as could be; and the Captain asking him, <HI>What do you &s;ay, my Dear;</HI> he an&s;wer'd again as gravely, <HI>I won't &s;wear;</HI> and look'd as if he was near crying; but the Mother carry'd it all off with Rallery and Je&s;t at the Captain. Now Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> there's more in that one Word the Child &s;aid, and his Way of &s;peaking it, than in all that you have laught &s;o much at. How fooli&s;h it is to talk &s;o to Children! <HI>&s;ays his</HI>

I &s;han't make the Child cry, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but the Child almo&s;t makes me cry; it's pity that Child &s;hould not be taught; it grieves me for him: <HI>She banter'd him &s;till,</HI> O you are &s;o religious <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> now you are on Shore, I warrant, when you are at Sea, you can thunder like a <HI>North Wind;</HI> what would you have me teach him at this Age?

Come, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee I'll try him, <HI>My Dear,</HI> &s;ays the bruti&s;h Wretch to the Child, (pointing to a little Kitten that he had been playing with) <HI>Who made that Cat?</HI> The Boy had taken in &s;ome little Idea's &s;uitable to him|&s;elf, from what the Captain had &s;aid, and had been very attentive to him; and when his Mother ask'd him that Que&s;tion, <HI>&s;tair'd at her</HI> as if he had been frighted: What ails the Child, <HI>&s;ays the Mother?</HI> Nay, what ails his Mother, <HI>&s;ays the Captain?</HI> I never heard any thing &s;o abominable in my Life; upon this, the Child fell a crying. The Mother, far from being touch'd with any reflex Thought upon what &s;he had &s;aid, fell to work to quiet the Child; but &s;till ban|tering the Captain with the ridiculous Stuff, <HI>as &s;he call'd it,</HI> of talking &s;o to Children, and asking them &s;uch Que&s;tions as they under&s;tood nothing of: Well, well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you have ask'd him a wi&s;er Que&s;tion than any of them, and I think the Child has an&s;wer'd you as well. Nay, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> he has not an&s;wer'd me at all. Not an&s;wer'd you! <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> I think he has effectually an&s;wer'd. Why, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> he did nothing but cry. Well, and what do you think he cry'd for, <HI>&s;ays the Captain?</HI> Nay, what do I know? <HI>&s;ays the Mother;</HI> you made him cry, I think: No, no, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> he cry'd to hear his Mother talk &s;o prophanely. Was that it, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> think you? You &s;hall &s;ee, I'll ask him again and he
<PB N="269" REF="280">
won't cry, and that will prove you are mi&s;taken. If you ask him &s;uch a vile Que&s;tion again, <HI>&s;ays the Cap|tain very warmly,</HI> I am &s;atisfy'd he will cry again, or GOD will put &s;ome Words in the Infant's Mouth to an&s;wer you; for out of the Mouths of &s;uch as the&s;e <HI>he has ordain'd Prai&s;e.</HI> Nay, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, not at all touch'd &s;till,</HI> if you come to prophe&s;y, Captain, we have an opportunity to know whether you are a fal&s;e Prophet or a true. I don't Prophe&s;y, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but I hope he will. I'll try your Gift, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> and impudently ask'd the Child again, <HI>who made that Cat?</HI> The Boy did not cry, but &s;aid nothing. The Captain look'd &s;teadily on the Child, and the Child look'd &s;teadily on its Mother. Now, Captain, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> where's your Gift of Prophe&s;y? You &s;ee he don't cry, nor he don't &s;peak; why don't you an&s;wer me <HI>JACKY? &s;ays the Mother.</HI> Let him alone, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> he is big with it, he will bring out &s;omething pre&s;ently: The Child he&s;itated two or three Times, and then look|ing up in his Mother's Face, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> very gravely, <HI>Who made you, Mother?</HI> The Captain pulling off his Hat, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, <HI>&s;ays he aloud,</HI> that has not left him&s;elf without a Witne&s;s again&s;t his Enemies, even in the Mouths that are not yet open'd.</Q></P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e, as it may be well &s;uppos'd, put all the re&s;t of the Company to a little &s;tand, and the Mirth ceas'd with every Body but the Mother: <HI>But &s;he</HI> having not the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion made upon her, turn'd it all into Je&s;t and Banter; and &s;o the Con|ver&s;ation chang'd for a while, and the Captain enter|tain'd him&s;elf with the re&s;t of the Company. It hap|pen'd, he fell into Talk with a Gentlewoman, who was a Relation to the Family, who he found was much &s;oberer than the re&s;t of the Company, and very religious; and they had not been long in Di&s;cour&s;e, but the Gentlewoman took Notice of his Battle with the Mother of the Child, and <HI>told him,</HI> &s;he thought
<PB N="270" REF="281">
what he &s;aid <HI>was very ju&s;t,</HI> and &s;he wondred that her Cou|&s;in was not &s;tartled at what the Child had an&s;wer'd; for, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> it was very &s;urprizing. Alas!

Well Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> but I hope you do not confine the Grace of GOD; there may be a Principle founded in the Heart of the Child, <HI>I hope,</HI> by invi&s;ible Grace, without the Agency of Parents one way or other. That's true, <HI>&s;ays the Captain, &s;haking his Head,</HI> but how &s;hall it work! a|gain&s;t Education, again&s;t Example, without In&s;tru|ction, without Reproof, without Encouragement. <HI>O,</HI> Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I do not &s;ay but the outward Helps are all wanting here: but we mu&s;t not confine the Work of the Spirit of GOD to Means only; that would be, to own Religion to be only the Profe&s;&s;ion of our Education, whereas that <HI>Wind bloweth where it li&s;teth.</HI> The Captain was greatly &s;urpriz'd to find a Per&s;on of &s;uch Judgment in religious Things in &s;uch Company, where indeed he did not expect it; and was very de&s;irous to enter into farther Di&s;cour&s;e with her, about the Child and its Mother: And be|ing retired to a Corner of the Room, he entred into a very clo&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e with her about it: <HI>He told her,</HI> that he was greatly mov'd at what the Child had &s;aid; That he knew little of its Mother, having only come into the Family as his Bu&s;ine&s;s called him there. But you, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that I perceive are related to the Family, for they call you Cou&s;in; and as I find, have a Sen&s;e of Religion upon your Mind; methinks you cannot be without &s;ome Concern for this poor Lamb, which is to be brought up on the

<P>We were all &s;itting by the Fire, and very merry; the Child was at Play at his Mother's Knee, and my Cou&s;in was taken &s;uddenly Ill with the Cho|lick in her Stomach; &s;o I took the Child away, and he &s;tood by me a while: her Di&s;temper was not very violent at fir&s;t, tho afterwards it encrea&s;ed: but every now and then the Cholick &s;urpriz'd her with &s;harp, &s;hooting, &s;udden Pains, like a Stich in the Side; and whenever it did &s;o, &s;he would, as is the

profane way of &s;uch People, cry out, <HI>O GOD!</HI> The Child &s;tood, as I &s;aid, at my Knee very mute, &s;eeing his Mother not well, and continu'd &s;o a good while; and the Mother continuing ill, frequently re|peated the Expre&s;&s;ion as above. At la&s;t the Child goes of its own Accord from me to its Mother's Knee, and &s;tands &s;till looking &s;teadily up in its Mo|ther's Face: Says the Mother, what's the Matter <HI>Jacky?</HI> what do you look up at me &s;o for? are not you &s;orry your Mamma is not well? The Child made her no An&s;wer at all. She ask'd him again, and again, three or four Times, but 'twas all one, he would not &s;peak a Word. She would have been angry with him for not an&s;wering, but the Cholick interrupted her, and a Stitch or Pain &s;hooting in her Side as before, &s;he clap'd her Hand to her Side, and cries out again <HI>O GOD.</HI> The Child, as if it had waited for the Occa&s;ion, look'd up gravely in her Face again, and &s;ays <HI>Mamma, Who is O GOD, Mamma?</HI></P>

<P>Was none of the Family by but you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, two of the Daughters were there, and one of them was &s;truck a little and look'd up at me, but &s;aid nothing; her Mother's Illne&s;s prevented it at that Time.</P>

<P>She &s;aid nothing ju&s;t then, &s;he was &s;o ill; but you know Children are not ea&s;ily &s;ilenc'd, they will have their Que&s;tions an&s;wer'd, and &s;o the Boy ask'd her again and again: She put him by, and bid him be quiet, for &s;he was not well; but it wou'd|not do, he wou'd know who it was: She put him off again, and told him 'twas <HI>No Body.</HI></P>

<P>However, it would not do with the Boy; he reiz'd his Mother for an An&s;wer, and I &s;aw &s;he was a little perplex'd with it; &s;o I took the Child away, and &s;et him in my Lap, and to divert him, I ask'd him, who he thought it was? The Boy an&s;wer'd me, it was <HI>the Doctor.</HI> And why <HI>the Doctor, Jack,</HI> &s;aid I: Becau&s;e his Mother, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> call'd him to come and cure her.

<P>Truly, there was no Room for it, without telling him, that his Mother was a wicked, wretched Creature, and u&s;ed the Word prophanely; or el&s;e let|ting him think there was no Harm in it; and I was in &s;ome Strait what to do; but I let him alone a while, and turn'd my Di&s;cour&s;e to the Daughter, who, I ob|&s;erv'd took Notice of what he had &s;aid: <HI>Says I to her,</HI> we &s;ee what need we have to be cautious what we &s;ay before Children, tho they are never &s;o little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it's like &s;he took as little Notice of it as the re&s;t.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay but it &s;eem'd to make more Impre&s;|&s;ion upon her than upon any of the re&s;t, at that Time; but it went off again: For if &s;uch Things would have any Effect upon them, they meet with them every Day from this little Creature: What it is in the Child, or whence it comes, I cannot pretend to &s;ay; for I know the Family is &s;o perfectly Grace|le&s;s, and void even of the lea&s;t Show of Religion, that I am confident the Child never had a Word of good &s;poke to it, or a Word of <HI>who made him,</HI> &s;aid in its hearing (till within the&s;e two Months), &s;ince it was able to &s;peak.</P>

<P>Well, but what was the Rea&s;on he would not go to <HI>Church?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, no Body ask'd him a good while about that, till after he was quiet and merry again; and then je&s;ting with him, his Mother call'd him and ask'd him what was the Rea&s;on he would not go to Church? He grew &s;erious and <HI>grave</HI> upon her Que&s;tion, and would not &s;peak a great while; at la&s;t he told her, <HI>he would not learn to Swear.</HI> They were all &s;urpriz'd at the Boy's An&s;wer, and could not imagine what it meant: Why, <HI>Sirrah, &s;ays his Mother,</HI> do Folks learn to &s;wear at Church? Yes, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they did; and he would not go to Church; the Maid pre&s;ently recollected the Pa&s;&s;age, and told the Story. They did but je&s;t; my Dear, <HI>&s;ays the Mother,</HI> they don't learn to &s;wear at Church; but all would not do, the Boy did not &s;ee the Je&s;t, he took them at their Words; and his Mo|ther was very indifferent as to per&s;wading him, and &s;o it pa&s;s'd on.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e the Maid in&s;tructed him bet|ter after?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;he did; but to this Day, if tho&s;e Gen|tlemen come to the Hou&s;e, he won't come into the Room where they are; and if his Mother, or any of his Si&s;ters take GOD's Name in vain, if the Boy be never &s;o merry, he will turn grave and &s;urly, and &s;hew his Di&s;gu&s;t; and if they do it again, as &s;ome|times the wicked Creatures will do it on purpo&s;e to angry him; if it is his Mother, <HI>he will cry;</HI> if it be

his Si&s;ters, he will fly at them, and tear their Laces and Headcloths, and any thing he can come at; and if it be any of his Brothers, he will <HI>&s;pit at them.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e Things are only diverting to them; I perceive; but, I a&s;&s;ure you, they are very in&s;tructing to me; what great pity it is that &s;ome well-enclin'd capable Per&s;on does not get this Child out of the wretched Family? It would be a great Act of Cha|rity; for doubtle&s;s Charity to the Soul, is the highe&s;t Degree of Charity in the World.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no doing it; who can take a Child from its own Father and Mother? They are not Poor, and &s;o they do not want to have it kept; if they were, I would have took it away long ago.</P>

Yes, Margy,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;o he calls me:</HI> So I took down the Book, and went to look the Place where I us'd to teach him; but the Book open|ing accidentally at another Place, the Child claps both his Hands upon the Leaves, as if he had been at play, and began to look upon the Book: <HI>No,</HI> my Dear, &s;ays I, <HI>that is not the Place;</HI> let me look your Le&s;&s;on. <HI>No,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I will learn my Book here.</HI> I would have turn'd it over again, but he would not &s;tir away his Hands: <HI>Here,</HI> Margy, <HI>here,</HI> &s;ays he. <HI>What just here,</HI> my Dear, &s;aid I. <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>just here, just here;</HI> and puts his Finger to a Line, as if he had known it: I was a little &s;urpriz'd, becau&s;e I know he could not read a Word, nor know any thing of what was before him; but it came into my Thought that I would &s;ee what it was the Child pointed &s;o at; for I &s;ee him &s;o po&s;itive, that I &s;ay it a little &s;urpriz'd me; but I was more &s;urpriz'd, when I found the Words were in the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 16. <HI>Woe is unto me, if I preach not the Go&s;pel:</HI> Well, thought I to my &s;elf, this Child will certainly be a Mini&s;ter.</P>

<P>Well, Madam, there is another Thing is yet more wonderful to me than all this, and that is, that &s;uch remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e, in a Child &s;o young, does not work &s;ome great Alteration in the Family: Why, &s;uch a Child is enough to make a whole Family &s;erious, if they were the prophane&s;t Wretches in Nature before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, it is &s;o; but it has a quite con|trary Effect here; the Mother of this Child is &s;o ef|fectually harden'd again&s;t all manner of Conviction, that nothing affects her; and while it is &s;o, how &s;hould it touch any of the re&s;t of the Family?</P>

<P>I &s;ee no Signal of it; &s;he ridicules it all, and they by her Example; and if at any Time &s;ome of them are a little concern'd, it wears off again, as I told you of one of the Si&s;ters; and the Mother laughs them our of every thing that is &s;erious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis a &s;ad Thing; but I cannot but think it will be otherwi&s;e at la&s;t; if this Boy proves &s;uch a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them, as <HI>he &s;eems to be,</HI> it will certainly have &s;ome Effect upon &s;ome of them, one Time or other, tho it may not ju&s;t now: Pray what &s;ays the Father to it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Sir, the Father is Ma&s;ter of more Sen&s;e, and more Mode&s;ty than the Mother, or than any of the Children; and he is not &s;o harden'd as they are to banter and make a Je&s;t of Religion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly the Man has a Sen&s;e of Religion up|on his Mind at other Times, and he hates mortally to hear his Wife talk &s;o prophanely as &s;he ordinarily does, and will often reprove her for it.</P>

<P>Take it! truly &s;he does not take it at all; &s;he rallies him with his Drunkenne&s;s, and his Fits of Repentance between it; and then talks the more prophanely for his Admonition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is the ju&s;t Con&s;equence of a Man reproving Sin, that is not reform'd him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Exceedingly indeed; he will call him&s;elf all the drunken Sots, and wicked, cur&s;ed Wretches that he can think of, the next Morning after he has been drunk, and repent, and cry, and beg GOD to for|give him; it is hardly to be de&s;crib'd how he re|proves him&s;elf.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two or three Days! alas, not through the &s;ame Day they were made in, oftentimes; if that wretched Company comes to him, or &s;ends for him, he will be as bad the &s;ame Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why does he not avoid them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>He often &s;ays he will, but he has no Power to refrain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he is loath to di&s;oblige them; for they are People he gets well by, another way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's true; but there is a &s;ecret &s;trong Inclination within too, which bids him go, and not only &s;o, but bids him drink when he is there; and this I look upon to be the wor&s;t Part of the Tempta|tion, and the harde&s;t for him ever to get over.</P>

<P>Well, but you &s;ay he does not do as his Wife does, at wor&s;t; he does not contemn GOD and Re|ligion, as &s;he does.</P>

<P>And how does he carry it to this Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>O he loves it mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately, and loves it for the&s;e very Things that we are talking of; and often tells the Mother GOD has taken that Child from her; that &s;he is left to breed up all the re&s;t for the Devil, but that this Child will live to reprove her, and will be able to teach them all; and 'tis he keeps the Maid <HI>Margaret</HI> in the Hou&s;e, the Mother wou'd have turn'd her away el&s;e long ago, for &s;he hates the Maid becau&s;e &s;he teaches the Child good Things.</P>

<HEAD>The Fourth DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Di&s;cour&s;e ended here; <HI>Margaret</HI> went up Stairs with the Child, the Cap|tain went away, and the Gentlewoman, who it &s;eems lay in the Hou&s;e that Night, went to the re&s;t of the Company; but <HI>Margaret,</HI> as &s;he was bid to do, laid up the&s;e Things in her Heart, and apply'd her &s;elf with more Diligence than ever, to in&s;truct and teach the Child; and particularly, &s;he brought him to be able to read very prettily, before any Body in the Hou&s;e knew that he could tell the Letters when he &s;aw them; for tho, as I &s;aid, he was carry'd to School to an old Woman in the Neigh|bourhood, it was more to be out of the Way, when they had any thing el&s;e for his Maid to do, than for any thing they thought he &s;hould learn; and be&s;ides, it was chiefly before <HI>Margaret</HI> came, that they &s;ent him to School, and he very &s;eldom went afterward.</P>
<P>As &s;he taught him to read, &s;o &s;he taught him to know Things proper for a Child &s;o young to know; &s;he fill'd his young Thoughts with an Awe and Re|verence of GOD; a love of every thing that was Good and Religious; &s;he taught him &s;everal little Prayers for Night and Morning, and po&s;&s;e&s;t him with ju&s;t Notions of it being his Duty to pray to GOD to ble&s;s him, and keep him; and that it was a wicked Thing to lye down to &s;leep without kneeling down, and praying to GOD to keep him while he was a&s;leep; or to be dre&s;s'd in the Morning, without praying to GOD to ble&s;s him in the Day.</P>
<P>She had before taught him to believe, that it was
<PB N="290" REF="301">
a very wicked Thing to mention the Name of GOD upon common Occa&s;ions; and that, when the Chil|dren that play'd with him did &s;o, they were wicked Children; and abundance of &s;uch Things as the&s;e, &s;uitable to the Capacity of the Child, and of his Years; and &s;he always ob&s;erv'd, and it was an En|couragement to her, that the Child was &s;o exceed|ingly plea&s;ed, and eager for her little Di&s;cour&s;es and In&s;tructions to it, that it would leave its Play at any time to go up Stairs with <HI>Margy;</HI> and at other Times would hale and pull her from his Mother, or any Body el&s;e, crying <HI>Margy, Margy,</HI> up Stairs, up Stairs; &s;o that <HI>Margaret</HI> never wanted Opportunity, and yet no Body in the Hou&s;e perceiv'd it; for when ever the Child call'd <HI>Margy</HI> to go up Stairs, no Body would hinder her, &s;uppo&s;ing he wanted her on other Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>While &s;he was talking to him one Day, of the wicked Children u&s;ing bad Words, and taking GOD's Name in vain at their Play: The Child &s;top'd her; but <HI>Margy, &s;ays he,</HI> it is not a wicked Thing to call for <HI>O GOD</HI> when One an't well, or any thing hurts, <HI>is it not, Margy?</HI> Yes, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Margaret, we mu&s;t never call upon GOD but with Reverence, to help, and ble&s;s, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us, as you do in your Prayers, my Dear. Why, <HI>Margy, &s;ays the Child,</HI> won't <HI>O GOD</HI> come and help them when they cry out &s;o, and they ben't well? <HI>No,</HI> my Dear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> if he &s;hould, it would <HI>fright them dreadfully,</HI> not help them; and &s;o &s;he went on to explain to him, as well as &s;he could get him to under&s;tand it, the Wickedne&s;s of that unhappy Cu&s;tom, which many People have of cry|ing out <HI>O GOD!</HI> in their Pain, or upon any Suprize; and the Difference between that Way of u&s;ing the Name of GOD, and an awful &s;olemn u&s;ing it in his Prayers; but &s;he could not make the Child a great while leave off joyning the Word <HI>GOD</HI> with the
<PB N="291" REF="302">
great O as one Word, and as <HI>a Sub&s;tantive:</HI> So &s;he let him alone in that, as a Thing of no Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>But <HI>one Day,</HI> as he was li&s;t'ning very attentively to her, and &s;he talking of its being a wicked Thing for People to cry out <HI>O GOD!</HI> when they were in Pain, except it was in a &s;olemn way: He &s;ays to her, But <HI>Margy,</HI> was it a wicked Thing when my <HI>Mamma</HI> call'd for <HI>O GOD?</HI> The Maid was at a little Surprize, for &s;he was loath to give the Child an Idea of his Parent's doing wicked Thinys; &s;o at fir&s;t &s;he &s;aid nothing: but he was never to be left unan&s;wer'd in any Que&s;tion he ask'd, for he would not leave it; he ask'd her again and again, and then teiz'd her with, was it <HI>Margy?</HI> Was it? Was it? and would not be put by. At la&s;t, the Maid was forc'd to &s;ay, <HI>Yes it was indeed.</HI> At which the Child fell a crying.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome Time after this, that his Mother had another Fit of the Cholick, as it &s;eems &s;he frequent|ly had, and was in great Pain; and the Gentlewo|man their Cou&s;in, who we have mention'd before, was &s;ent for, as &s;he u&s;ually was on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to her: And &s;till when the Pains of the Cholick affected her Nerves, and made her &s;tart, or grip'd her Stomach, as 'tis known is the Ca&s;e in that violent Di&s;temper, &s;he, according to her profane U&s;age, &s;till cried out <HI>O GOD!</HI> And once in particular, having more Pain than ordinary, &s;he re|peated it four times together, without any other Words, as fa&s;t as her Tongue could &s;peak it: The Child was in the Chamber, but was at play at a Window on the other &s;ide of the Room, a good way from her. When he fir&s;t heard his Mother cry out <HI>O God,</HI> he &s;top'd his Play, and turning about, &s;tood &s;tock &s;till, looking very gravely at his Mother; But when he heard her repeat the Words four times
<PB N="292" REF="303">
together in a kind of a Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>as above,</HI> he ran to the Bed &s;ide to her; <HI>MAMMA! &s;aid he;</HI> what d'ye &s;ay? &s;ays his Mother, <HI>Don't call O GOD Mamma,</HI> &s;ays the Child; why, &s;ays his Mother, what's the Matter? Why, <HI>he won't come Mamma,</HI> &s;ays the Child: Won't he Sirrah, <HI>&s;ays his Mother,</HI> how do you know he won't? The Boy &s;tood &s;till a good while, hammering his Thoughts to bring out what he had in his Mind; at la&s;t, &s;ays he, <HI>If O GOD &s;hould come,</HI> Mamma, <HI>you would be afraid.</HI> Well, and would not you he afraid too? &s;ays his Mother: <HI>Yes, Mamma,</HI> &s;ays the Child: And mus'd a while, and then brings it out, <HI>A-but I don't call him Mamma:</HI> The Mother, had &s;he had a Heart le&s;s ob&s;tinate and in&s;en&s;ible than an Idiot, would have been mov'd with it; but &s;he put it off and &s;poke angrily to the Child, to be rid of him: However, he was not to be put off, neither with good Words or bad; but after a little Stop, he falls to it again. <HI>Mamma,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>don't call O GOD, no more, Mamma.</HI> Well, well, &s;ays his Mother, be quiet. <HI>Won't you then,</HI> Mamma, <HI>&s;ays the Boy?</HI> She would not promi&s;e a great while; but the Boy pull'd her, and teiz'd her with, <HI>Won't you,</HI> Mamma, <HI>Won't you,</HI> Mamma? At la&s;t, to be rid of him, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Well, I won't then.</HI> No more, <HI>Mamma?</HI> &s;ays the Boy. Well, <HI>no more</HI> then, &s;ays his Mother. <HI>Never no more,</HI> Mamma? &s;ays the Boy: The Boy's mad, I think, <HI>&s;ays his Mother;</HI> take him away a little &s;ome body; where's his Maid? Well, the Boy would not be taken away till &s;he had &s;aid, <HI>Never no more;</HI> and then he went away quietly.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Boy was gone, the good Gentlewo|man, who was by, bur&s;t out into Tears, &s;he could hold no longer. <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>are you not at all concern'd at what this little Child has &s;aid to you.</HI> No not I, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what &s;hould I be concern'd at it for? I don't mind &s;uch Prattle; what &s;ignifies what Chil|dren
<PB N="293" REF="304">
&s;ay at three or four Year old? <HI>Why, Cou&s;in,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>do you think this Child could &s;ay all this to you of meer Prattle</HI> and <HI>from meer Nature? Do you think there's nothing el&s;e in it?</HI> What el&s;e can there be in it, <HI>&s;ays the Mother?</HI> What &s;trange thing would you make of it? <HI>INDEED CO&V;SIN, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> I &s;hould think <HI>it was a Reproof &s;ent from Heaven to me.</HI> And certainly this little Creature could not &s;ay all this of it &s;elf: <HI>&s;ays the Mother,</HI> I know <HI>Margy</HI> is always talking her litt'e idle Stories to the Child; but if I thought &s;he had the Impudence to teach him to talk thus to me, I'd take care to rid the Hou&s;e of her. You mi&s;take me quite, <HI>replies her Cou&s;in,</HI> I don't think 'tis from <HI>Margy, but from him that made</HI> Margy. And <HI>I'll tell you,</HI> Cou&s;in, <HI>if you do not look upon it to be &s;o too, I think you will be much in the Wrong.</HI> I don't trouble my Head about it, not I, &s;ays the Mother.</P>
<P>While they were talking of this, in comes the Child's Father; and after asking his Wife how &s;he did, and &s;peaking to his Cou&s;in a little, he ask'd, <HI>Where's my Boy?</HI> And this introduc'd a &s;hort Di&s;|cour&s;e among them all, about what had happen'd: <HI>Says his Wife,</HI></P>

<P>All this while, tho the Father of the Child &s;eem'd a little affected ju&s;t at the Time, while any thing was fre&s;h upon his Mind, yet the Mother <HI>&s;aid true enough in that;</HI> he was one that <HI>confe&s;s'd all</HI> and <HI>reform'd none.</HI> He was always crying out upon him&s;elf, what a wicked Wretch he was, and how wicked a Family he had, and how all his Children were bred up for the Devil; and every now and then he would cry, <HI>The Lord have Mercy upon him,</HI> and <HI>GOD forgive him.</HI> But &s;till he continued a poor drunken, &s;wearing Creature, that was never the better for all his Re|pentance; and the Family went on ju&s;t as they were before.</P>
<P>The little Boy, cho&s;en by Providence from the Bowels of &s;uch a wicked Race, and &s;ingl'd out as a Mark of divine &s;pecial free Love, went on <HI>as before,</HI> and grew in <HI>favour both with GOD and Man;</HI> Wonderful Marks of early Piety appear'd in him, as
<PB N="300" REF="311">
&s;oon as his Years would admit: The Father, tho' he had little or nothing in him of GOD, yet had been &s;o well plea&s;ed with what he found the Maid had done for the Child, that he re&s;olv'd &s;he &s;hould not be remov'd from him; and the Mother hating the Wench for her religious Care of the Child, re|&s;olv'd to turn her away. This Strife between the Father and Mother remov'd the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Child from them both, for a Time; and that, which <HI>had GOD's Grace concur'd,</HI> would have been a Means to awaken and re&s;tore them all, was made a Ble&s;&s;ing to another Family; for the Mother was &s;o provok'd at the Reproof the&s;e Things had been to her, and that her Husband would not con&s;ent to her putting away the Maid, that &s;he began to hate the Child as well as the Wench; and the Father perceiving it, he re|&s;olv'd to &s;end the Child, <HI>and the Maid with it,</HI> into the Country. The Mother, it &s;eems, being glad to be rid of them both, was very willing they &s;hould go; &s;o they were &s;ent to a Brother of the Father's at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where the poor Maid did not change at all for the Better as to Religion; for the Family was not one Jot more religious than the other, only, of the two, they were a little mode&s;ter and better na|tur'd People.</P>
<P>The Boy growing a little bigger, now began to run about, and play with &s;uch other Children as were &s;uitable to him in Years; but was &s;o nice in his Company, that if any of the Children he was with, u&s;ed bad Words, he wou'd not keep them Company, nor play with them any more. There happen'd to come a Lady to vi&s;it at the Hou&s;e, who brought a little pretty Boy with her; and the two Children were playing together a while, when, on a &s;uddain, the Child came away from the other, and would not play with him any longer, for any Per&s;wa&s;ions they could u&s;e: The Lady wanted to know the Rea&s;on.
<PB N="301" REF="312">
<HI>Says the Child,</HI> He is a wicked Boy, he &s;ays bad Words: The Lady wanted to know what Words they were the Child had &s;poken; the Boy would not an&s;wer; they pre&s;s'd him earne&s;tly, but he would not &s;peak: After long per&s;wading, he told them, <HI>He was afraid to &s;ay the Words;</HI> nor could they make him &s;ay the Words over again; for he told them, <HI>he mu&s;t never &s;peak tho&s;e Words, but when he &s;aid his Prayers.</HI></P>
<P>Abundance of &s;uch In&s;tances he gave of his early Sen&s;e of Religion, while he &s;tay'd at this Place, in|&s;omuch that he reform'd two Girls in the Family where he was, and their Example reform'd their Mother; but their Stories are too long for this Work, even the very little Boys, that play'd with him, were the better for him; and the Children would go Home again and tell their Parents what a little Boy they play'd with; that if any Boy u&s;ed wicked Words, &s;aid <HI>O LORD,</HI> or <HI>O GOD,</HI> or any naughty Word, he would beat them, and put them out of his Company. This brought the Childrens Mothers from all Parts of the Town to &s;ee this wonderful Child, and he became &s;o well known round the Country, that ma|ny came from other Towns to &s;ee and talk with him, to &s;atisfy their Curio&s;ity: All this while the Maid continu'd to take a great deal of Care of him; &s;he taught him his Catechi&s;e diligently, and the fir&s;t Principles of Religion; and the Mini&s;ter took a deal of plea&s;ure in talking with him, and in&s;tructing him, in &s;hort he was &s;o inqui&s;itive in religious Matters, &s;o &s;erious and &s;o agreeably improving, that any one that had a Sen&s;e of Religion mu&s;t needs be delighted with him. He began now to be a great Boy, and it was time for him to go to School; &s;o, after about three Years tending him, hone&s;t <HI>Margy</HI> was di&s;|mi&s;s'd, and the Boy was taken Home to his Father and Mother again.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="313">
By what has been &s;aid, Notice may be taken how &s;ignally the Providence of GOD provided In&s;tructi|on, and Opportunity for religious Knowledge in the Infancy of this Child; &s;o that, tho it was brought forth in a Family where there was no Advantages of Education to be had, yet the Child gain'd a &s;tock of Knowledge above his Years, which added to his ori|ginal Inclination, and &s;teady Pur&s;uit of early Piety, made him an extraordinary Child every way, and this is indeed the Rea&s;on of my telling this Part of the Child's Story, <HI>(viz.)</HI> To record the &s;ignal Di&s;po|&s;itions of that Providence, which, as in its original Decrees, it &s;ingles out Objects of Mercy from Fami|lies, where no Fear of GOD is; &s;o it does not how|ever illuminate the Minds of tho&s;e &s;o &s;ingl'd out by meer In&s;piration and miraculous Revelation; but furni&s;hes the ordinary Means of In&s;truction, letting us know that Education and in&s;tructing of Children in the Knowledge of GOD, and the mo&s;t early Re|verence of Religion, is not the Duty of Parents on|ly, but is the ordinary Means which GOD has ap|pointed for the reaching the Hearts of tho&s;e Chil|dren, who are &s;ingl'd out by him for his own Service. But to return to the Story:</P>
<P>The Father of this Child having now gotten his Son home again, put him to School to learn Latin at a Grammar School in the Neighbourhood; and as he was acquainted much among Sea-faring Men, a Captain of a Ship, that came home from <HI>Berbadoes,</HI> brought him home a little Negro Boy about 14 Year old: The Boy, it &s;eems, was born in that I&s;land, and yet he &s;poke but imperfect <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> however, as he was of a &s;uitable Age for &s;uch Work, he appointed him to wait upon his little Son.</P>
<P>The Child, however acceptable abroad, as I have ob&s;erv'd, yet was &s;o far from winning upon his own Family, by his religious and &s;ober Carriage, that his
<PB N="303" REF="314">
Mother had &s;lighted him for &s;ome Years; and his Brothers and Si&s;ters did the &s;ame by her Example; his Father only mo&s;t affectionately lov'd him; and tho his Son's religious Life had no &s;aving Influence upon him, at lea&s;t not for a great while, yet it had a great effect upon his Morals; for it abated in his Fa|ther the u&s;e of Swearing, and ill Words, meerly be|cau&s;e he could not think of being reprov'd by his own Son; indeed it partly civilliz'd the whole Family, for he would never fail to reprove them all, and that very roughly too in his Way; only it had this Diffe|rence in its Effect, that as his Brothers and Si&s;ters ha|ted him for it, &s;o his Father lov'd him for it mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately.</P>
<P>The young Negro being now to be his Comrade; the fir&s;t Day or two after he had him, <HI>truly he turn'd him away,</HI> and would have <HI>nothing to do with him:</HI> His Father coming to hear it; <HI>I warrant you,</HI> &s;ays his Father, this young black Rogue has had &s;ome ugly Words in his Mouth, either he has &s;worn, or taken GOD's Name in vain, or &s;ome &s;uch Thing, and if he has, <HI>Jack</HI> will ne'er endure him again; &s;o he caus'd the Child to be ask'd, and he told his Father he had &s;aid &s;uch dreadful Words as he never heard in his Life; it &s;eems he had u&s;ed the common Phra&s;e of the I&s;land where he was born, <HI>Dam him,</HI> or &s;uch like: Upon this, the Father call'd the Boy to him, and told him how the Ca&s;e was, that <HI>Toby (&s;o the Negro was call'd)</HI> was not a Chri&s;tian, and did not <HI>know GOD,</HI> and therefore did not know it was a Sin; but that he &s;hould be &s;oundly whipp'd for it, and then he would do it no more.</P>
<P>His Son &s;eem'd very well &s;atisfy'd with that Ac|count; but &s;aid, <HI>No,</HI> if he did not know it was a Sin, he &s;hould not be whipp'd for it the fir&s;t Time; but that he &s;hould be told then what GOD was, and that it was a Sin to u&s;e &s;uch Words, and then if he
<PB N="304" REF="315">
broke the Law that was &s;et him, he made his Father promi&s;e him that he would have him be whipp'd foundly: Upon this, and his Father promi&s;ing, he he took the Negro to him again.</P>
<P>But to &s;ee how he u&s;ed this Boy! how he examin'd him! in&s;tructed him! talk'd to him! could it be all &s;et down, it would be very in&s;tructing; but it is im|po&s;&s;ible: however, one of their Di&s;cour&s;es being &s;omething publick, may be u&s;eful for its particular variety.</P>

<P>With the&s;e Re&s;olutions he gain'd &s;ome Ground of his Appetite; but it threw him into an agui&s;h Indi&s;|po&s;ition, and he grew much out of order; however, he re&s;olv'd upon this, that Life or Death was before him, and that not only Death in the ordinary Con|&s;truction of that Word, but eternal Death, Soul, and Body; and he re&s;olv'd to keep his Ground, whate|ver was the Con&s;equence; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Health, he remov'd into the Country.</P>

<P>The Work of GOD upon the Heart of this poor Savage was &s;trong, and its Progre&s;&s;ion wonderful; his Repentance appear'd to be founded in the Sen&s;e
<PB N="324" REF="335">
of GOD's Mercy, the be&s;t Motive to the be&s;t Re|pentance; and of all that he under&s;tood of GOD's Mercy, this affected him mo&s;t, that he would hear and forgive &s;uch a poor black wicked Creature, &s;uch a de&s;picable lo&s;t Wretch as he. This brought Tears in his Eyes, melted his Heart; and tho he was as ig|norant as meer Nature can be &s;uppos'd to be, yet his Conviction led him the right Way, to the right End of Convictions, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Admiration and A&s;toni&s;h|ment at the Goodne&s;s of GOD, and then to Con|trition and true Repentance for his Sin.</P>
<P>But his poor pious Teacher was as full as his Heart could hold with it; he was affected to an extream not to be expre&s;s'd, but was at a &s;ad Lo&s;s how to di|rect any farther: He wept and cry'd over poor <HI>Toby</HI> every Day; but he was too young; he did know what to &s;ay to him; and the poor Negro ask'd him a thou&s;and Que&s;tions every Day, that he knew not how to an&s;wer: GOD had been pleas'd to touch this poor Creature's Heart, and make him a &s;incere Convert, and this poor Child was all the In&s;tructor he had, and he could go but a little Way with him: They were always together, and <HI>Toby</HI> made the Child &s;ay his Prayers over to him, and teach him; and he learnt <HI>Toby</HI> the Lord's Prayer, and the two little Prayers which <HI>Margy</HI> taught him; and &s;till the black Boy, who was older than the other, was &s;o inqui&s;itive in|to good Things, that the white Boy could not fully an&s;wer him; for, poor Child, he had had no In&s;tru|ctor him&s;elf, but the hone&s;t religious Maid, except the Mini&s;ter at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and he was not acquaint|ed long with him, &s;o that he was at a great Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But Providence, which never leaves &s;uch Work as this unfini&s;h'd, &s;oon a&s;&s;i&s;ted them both; for his Father not liking the Accommodations they had there, very well, took a new Lodging; and it happen'd that they found in the Hou&s;e a Lodger, an antient good Lady, as

<P>With all my Heart; I love to ob&s;erve the early Touches of GOD's Grace in the Hearts of Children; but pray before you begin, what is be|come of that hone&s;t Servant, that <HI>Margy</HI> as you call her?</P>
</SP>

<P>Indeed I do not well know where &s;he lives; but &s;he is marry'd to a Captain of a Ship, who lov'd her for her U&s;age of this Child, and &s;he lives very hand&s;omely.</P>
</SP>
<P>Note, <HI>At about four Years end, the Captain, mention'd before, return'd from a long tra|ding Voyage in the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies, <HI>and very rich; and the first Thing he did, he enquir'd out</HI> Margy, <HI>and examin'd her and the Gen|tlewoman the Cou&s;in (&s;poken of above) about what &s;he had done with the Child, and how &s;he had di&s;charg'd her &s;elf of the Work he hired her for: And having a faithful Account of her extraordinary Conduct, and how &s;he had brought the Child up, he mar|ry'd her,</HI> as he &s;aid, <HI>that &s;he might bring up his own as well, for he had four &s;mall Chil|dren, his Wife dying while he was Abroad; and</HI> Margy <HI>made as religious a Wife as &s;he had done a Servant, and liv'd like a Lady, as we &s;hall hear by and by.</HI></P>

</SP>
<P>The Father liv'd not above half a Year after this; but made a very Chri&s;tian and religious End; being a mo&s;t &s;incerely humbled Penitent for his pa&s;t Life; frequently ble&s;&s;ing GOD for the fir&s;t Alarms he received in his wicked Cour&s;es, by the Reproof of that little Child. But neither his reformed Life, or his religious Death, had any immediate Influence upon his Wife, or any of the re&s;t of his Children; nay when his Will was open'd and read, &s;he was rather enraged than affected with a Clau&s;e in it, which took the di&s;po&s;al of his younge&s;t Son <HI>John</HI> out of her Hands, and left him to be di&s;po&s;ed by <HI>Margy &mdash;</HI> that was the Captain's Wife, formerly the Child's Maid, and by the Lady <HI>Barbara &mdash;,</HI> that was the Lodg|er, with whom he had the Di&s;cour&s;e above, about the di&s;po&s;ing of the Child: And it was thus expre&s;s'd in his Will, <HI>I do hereby empower them to enquire into the Treatment my &s;aid Child meets with under his own Relations, and to remove him if he is willing to be removed, and that they &s;ee Cau&s;e; according to a written Paper of Directions, &s;ign'd and &s;eal'd by my own Hand and Seal, declaring what &s;hall be e&s;teem'd a &s;ufficient Cau&s;e for &s;uch a removing my Child; which Pa|per</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="345">
<HI>I have left in the Hands of the &s;aid Mrs.</HI> Marga|ret &mdash; <HI>and the Lady</HI> Barbara &mdash;. The Mother was exceedingly unea&s;y at this Clau&s;e about the Child; and it rather encreas'd than abated the Aver&s;ion &s;he had before conceiv'd to him: And this made her per|haps the willinger to leave the Boy in the Country, where it &s;eems his Father had got a School for him, and had left him and the black Boy a little before he dy'd, recommending him earne&s;tly to the pious La|dy, who was the Lodger in the Hou&s;e, and who promi&s;ed to take as much care of him as if he was her own.</P>
<P>And indeed there was no need to recommend him to her; for the Child recommended him&s;elf to her, by the Sweetne&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition, the Sobriety of his Carriage, and his continual hanging about her to ask religious Que&s;tions, and talk of &s;erious Things with her; which, as it was exceeding delightful to her, &s;o it was all his Diver&s;ion; for when other Boys were at Play, this was his Recreation, and he drunk in Knowledge like Water; for his Search after In|&s;truction was &s;o earne&s;t, that nothing was lo&s;t up|on him.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed GOD &s;o to order Things for the early furni&s;hing In&s;truction to this Child, that (1.) this Lady, who was a Per&s;on of very good Quality was without any Family but two Servants, and &s;o was perfectly at Lei&s;ure to give, as it were, her whole Time to the Advantage of his Education. (2.) That &s;he was a Lady of va&s;t Knowledge and Capacity, join'd with admirable Experience, and a mo&s;t excellent Chri&s;tian. And (3.) that &s;he took &s;o much delight in the Child, and in his In&s;truction, that it was an un&s;peakable Affliction to her, when he was taken away from the School by his Mother; which was not, however, till &s;omewhat more than two Years.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="346">
In this Time he had acquir'd a Knowledge, and Experience in religious Matters above his Years; and as he received In&s;truction him&s;elf from this pious Lady, &s;o he brought up under him his Negro Boy, in the Knowledge of Religion, and the Practice of it too. Nor did the good Lady &s;pare any Pains, or think it below her to in&s;truct the poor Negro; and her favourite Boy would often de&s;ire her to do it, when any thing the Negro ask'd was too hard for him; by which &s;he was a Means at lea&s;t, to make the poor Savage Creature an Example of GOD's wonderful Grace, in revealing him&s;elf to his Soul, and bringing him from Darkne&s;s to Light. Among the many Di&s;cour&s;es which happen'd between her and the Child, I think one more than ordinarily worth recording, which happen'd &s;oon after the Child was come back from the Burial of his Father.</P>
<P>She had been up in her Chamber &s;omething longer than her u&s;ual Time; and as &s;he came down Stairs, &s;he &s;aw her little Scholar &s;itting alone in one of the Parlours, looking very Melancholy; and as &s;he thought, he either was, or had been crying; &s;he pre|&s;ently imagin'd, as was mo&s;t natural to his Ca&s;e, that the Child was thinking of his Father, and perhaps ca&s;t down to be left alone among Strangers, and no Father to have recour&s;e to as u&s;ual; &s;o &s;he thought &s;he would &s;peak chearfully to him. <HI>My Jacky,</HI> &s;ays &s;he (&s;o &s;he had call'd him for &s;ome time) what's the Matter my Dear? Come, you mu&s;t not be ca&s;t down Child, what have you been crying for?</P>

<P>And this was it you had been crying about, was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, I had been crying about her, but not for the Dream, for I &s;aw it was but a Dream; but the Thoughts that my dear Mother &s;hould not go to Heaven, has almo&s;t broke my Heart before that Dream, and I cry'd about that a great while, and it makes my Heart tremble every Time I think of it.</P>
</SP>
<P>While the Child was &s;aying this, <HI>just as he had dream'd,</HI> came a Coach, with one of their Servants in it, to fetch him to Town, and brought him word, that his Mother was very &s;ick at the Point of Death, and he mu&s;t go to <HI>London,</HI> that &s;he might &s;ee him be|fore &s;he dy'd: The Lady &s;aw the Child was &s;urpriz'd, and much the more becau&s;e of his Dream, and &s;o in|deed <HI>&s;he was her &s;elf a little,</HI> to &s;ee Things concur &s;o exactly one with another; however, &s;he conceal'd it from him, and did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">at &s;he could to encourage him, <HI>&s;o &s;he &s;aid,</HI> Come Child, do not be &s;urpriz'd, tho' this Part of your Dream may be true, I hope the other won't; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> but as &s;oon as he was dre&s;s'd, went away the Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>When he came, to <HI>London,</HI> he found his Mother
<PB N="344" REF="355">
on her Death-bed indeed, and very near her End; but &s;uch a Penitent as the like had not been known by any that conver&s;t with her; and upon enquiry, it appear'd that &s;he had been &s;truck with a Sen&s;e of her Condition for &s;ome Time before &s;he was taken &s;ick, and that it began immediately upon that affectionate Di&s;cour&s;e the Child had with her, mention'd before, when he went to ki&s;s her, and &s;aid, <HI>Dear Mother, don't break GOD's Commands,</HI> and particularly when he told her, <HI>that he was &s;ure no Body could go to Heaven that did &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>She had lain &s;ome Time under the Horror of her fir&s;t Convictions, and in a &s;ad de&s;pairing Condition, which began the &s;ame Evening the Boy had &s;poke to her; and this it &s;eems was the Rea&s;on of the Boy's being &s;ent away, which was not done by his Mother's Order, but by his elde&s;t Si&s;ter, who was no more &s;en&s;ible of the Nature of the Thing, than one given over, and therefore hated the Child for having griev'd and vex'd his Mother with his impertinent and &s;aucy Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>as &s;he call'd it,</HI> and therefore took upon her to &s;end the Child away, which her Mother was very much di&s;pleas'd at when &s;he knew it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Child came back, and was carry'd up into his Mother's Chamber, &s;he reviv'd a little at the Sight of him; <HI>Come hither, thou ble&s;&s;ed MES|SENGER of GOD,</HI> &s;ays &s;he; and taking him in her Arms, &s;he ki&s;s'd him, but could not &s;peak for a great while, her Heart was &s;o full; after &s;ome Time, holding the Child fa&s;t in her Arms, <HI>Thou wert the first,</HI> my Dear &s;aid &s;he, <HI>that ever gave me a &s;ea&s;onable Ad|monition of my dete&s;table Ways; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> I call to mind all the little Reproofs I had from thee in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Infancy, when thou could'st hardly &s;peak plain.</HI></P>

<P>A few Days after this Di&s;cour&s;e the Mother dy'd, and made a very happy and comfortable End; and the poor Child was left in an unhappy ill-guided Fa|mily, where he was capable of doing no Good, or of receiving any. After &s;ome Time the Family &s;e|parated, and this Child with one of his Si&s;ters were, at their own Reque&s;t, &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e where he was before, and where he had &s;o happily fallen into the Hands of that good Lady, who acted the Part of a Mother, and indeed more than a Mother with him before.</P>
<P>Here he was a Means of not only reforming, but effectually turning his Si&s;ter to be the mo&s;t &s;erious and religious young Woman imaginable; and this he did by a continual following her with Reproofs, re|ligious Di&s;cour&s;es, and con&s;tant Per&s;ua&s;ions to pray to GOD, and to read the Scripture, and to leave off all loo&s;e Words, as &s;candalous and unbecoming. And here he, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Teachings and In&s;tructions of the good Lady, brought the poor Ne|gro Boy <HI>Toby,</HI> who it &s;eems his Father had given to
<PB N="352" REF="363">
him to be his own, to be an extraordinary Chri&s;tian; and &s;o knowing in religious Principles, Doctrines, and Rules of Practice, that he was the Wonder of all that convers'd with him; all which he con&s;tantly acknowledged to be owing, under GOD, to the In|&s;truction and affectionate Care of his <HI>little Governour,</HI> for <HI>&s;o he always call'd him;</HI> I mean, the Child that was then become his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It was farther ob&s;ervable of this Negro Boy, that after he had been by the Exhortations and unwearied Pains of that good Lady, fully in&s;tructed in the Knowledge of Religion, &s;he cau&s;ed him at his own De&s;ire, and with the Con&s;ent of his little Governour, to be &s;olemnly baptiz'd: Upon which Occa&s;ion, he made &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith in Chri&s;t, and of the Rea&s;ons why he de&s;ir'd to be baptiz'd, as gave great Satisfaction to the Mini&s;ter who baptized him, and to all that heard it. But altho his being baptiz'd and becoming a real Chri&s;tian, gave him a Title to his Liberty, &s;o as that he was no more a Slave to &s;erve without Wages; yet he would never accept of that Advantage, nor by any Means leave his Ma&s;ter, or become a Servant for Wages, till his Ma&s;ter was grown up and voluntarily gave him his Di&s;mi&s;s.</P>
<P>After the Child had been &s;ome Time longer in this Place, the Captain, of whom mention was made in the beginning of this Story, and who had marry'd his Maid <HI>Margy,</HI> having Notice of the Death of his Mother, come to &s;ee him. It &s;eems the good Lady who had taken &s;o much the voluntary Charge of him, <HI>for it was no otherwi&s;e,</HI> had found Means to let the Captain know how his Father had, at his Death, re|commended his Son to his Care, together with his Wife; and it &s;eems the Lady being now to remove, and the Child growing to be pretty big, &s;he thought the guiding of him a little beyond her Ma|nagement, at lea&s;t &s;ingly, and &s;o &s;he de&s;ir'd the Cap|tain
<PB N="353" REF="364">
to come and con&s;ult about his farther Educa|tion.</P>

<HEAD>The Fifth DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I come to &s;peak of the Mea&s;ures taken by the Captain, which will fini&s;h the Story of the Boy, and does not go much farther, it will be very entertaining to go back a little to the Story of his Maid <HI>Margy,</HI> who it plea&s;ed GOD to make the fir&s;t In&s;tructor of this Child, as has been ob&s;erv'd already: How the Captain, after his rough manner, be&s;poke her con&s;tant Appli|cation to the teaching and in&s;tructing this Child, and gave her Money to encourage her; which he call'd <HI>Hiring her for GOD.</HI></P>
<P>The hone&s;t Wench needed none of tho&s;e warm Engagements, her Affection to the Child was &s;uch as led her many times to &s;hed Tears over him, on ac|count of the &s;ad Condition &s;he &s;aw him expo&s;ed to, and how mi&s;erable an Education he was like to have; and as &s;he told the Captain when he gave her that Money, &s;he thought it would break her Heart to think what Example, what guiding, and what dread|ful Temptations the poor Child would be expo&s;ed to as it grew up, &s;o &s;he was the mo&s;t anxious Creature in the World, when &s;he had the Teaching of him, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould not be able to prevent the evil Im|pre&s;&s;ions &s;uch Things might make upon him, after &s;he &s;hould be oblig'd to leave him.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="365">
But as he grew up he deliver'd her from tho&s;e Fears, and &s;he had the Satisfaction to have a faithful Account from the Child's Father <HI>while he lived,</HI> not only that he had been pre&s;erv'd him&s;elf, but how he had been a Means to do Good to others; and par|ticularly, how he had a great Hand in the convin|cing him <HI>(the Father)</HI> of the de&s;perate Wicked|ne&s;s of his Life, and of bringing him to a &s;erious and &s;incere Repentance.</P>
<P>Providence &s;ome time after this, carry'd this Maid into the Country, by the Accident of a Family &s;he &s;erv'd in for &s;ome Years; &s;o that &s;he was not at that Time acquainted with what occur'd in this Family; and particularly, did not hear of the Enquiry made after her on the following Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Captain had been at Sea, as was &s;aid, and going a trading Voyage to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> had been kept out no le&s;s than four Years; but to make amends for the Length of Time he was out, he came home exceeding rich; he was &s;o far from being unmind|ful of the little Boy, who he had in &s;o affectionate a manner recommended to this Maid <HI>Margy,</HI> that during his being abroad, he wrote twice to his Wife to enquire after the Child, and to know in particular, if <HI>Margy</HI> did her Duty to him; and if &s;he did, to give her a Sum of Money which he order'd for that purpo&s;e. The fir&s;t time the Captain's Wife found <HI>Margy</HI> with the Child in her Care, and gave her the Money; but the &s;econd time <HI>Margy</HI> being re|mov'd from the Child, and gone as I have &s;aid, into the Country to another Service, the Captain's Wife could not find her, which very much troubl'd her; for hearing &s;he was gone from the Child, &s;he had re|&s;olv'd to hire her into her own Hou&s;e, to look after her own Children.</P>
<P>This was <HI>Margy</HI>'s Lo&s;s and the Captain's Wife's al&s;o. At fir&s;t it was <HI>Margy</HI>'s Lo&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he had
<PB N="355" REF="366">
not the Money which was intended for her, and it was the Family's Lo&s;s becau&s;e they mi&s;s'd of &s;o good and &s;o faithful a Servant in the Hou&s;e among the Children, which were then very young; but the Lo&s;s was fully repair'd at la&s;t.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time the Captain came Home, and brought a va&s;t Wealth with him, God had been pleas'd to give him great Succe&s;s abroad, and he came home re&s;olv'd to go no more to Sea. But he had, with all his Succe&s;s, the bad News to receive at his coming Home, that his Wife was dead; which was a great Affliction to him, &s;he being both a very good Wife to him, and a very tender, careful, con&s;cientious Mo|ther to his Children.</P>
<P>He had not long con&s;ider'd the Circum&s;tances of his Family and Children, and the Want they &s;tood in of a careful, faithful Hand to guide and bring them up, but he bethought him&s;elf of hone&s;t <HI>Margy.</HI></P>
<P>He enquir'd, and &s;oon found &s;he was gone &s;ome time from the Child &s;he had the Charge of, and this made him de&s;irous to find her out; but he could by no means hear whither &s;he was gone. However, that he might have &s;ome account of her Conduct, and how &s;he had di&s;charg'd her &s;elf of the Tru&s;t he committed to her, he apply'd him&s;elf to the Gentle|woman who was pre&s;ent when he engag'd her, and gave her the Money to take Charge of the Child; whom in the former Dialogue we call'd the <HI>Cou&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>He had from her the whole Hi&s;tory of the Family, and particularly, of <HI>Margy</HI>'s Behaviour, and how careful &s;he had been of the Child, and with what good Succe&s;s her Care had been ble&s;s'd, <HI>as has been &s;aid.</HI> He al&s;o learn'd from her, that the &s;econd Sum of Money which he had &s;ent her, had not been paid her, becau&s;e neither his Wife nor &s;he her &s;elf, could by any Means hear whither the Maid was gone.</P>
<P>It troubled the Captain exceedingly that he could
<PB N="356" REF="367">
not hear of her, becau&s;e upon the Lo&s;s of his Wife, he had alter'd his Re&s;olution of not going to Sea any more; but was greatly concern'd who to leave the Government of his Children to in his Ab&s;ence; and being not only a tender Father, as to their being pro|vided for, but a mo&s;t religious Father, as to their be|ing well in&s;tructed, he would have given any thing in the World to have left his Children in the Conduct of &s;uch a Servant as <HI>Margy.</HI></P>
<P>It happen'd in this Juncture, that the Captain go|ing by Water in a Wherry from his Ship, which lay about <HI>Deptford;</HI> the Boat accidentally run foul of ano|ther Boat, in which there was a Maid and a Child. The Maid appear'd very much frighted at the Boat's falling foul of another; and the Captain &s;aid to her, Sweet-heart do not be afraid, there is no Danger. She made no An&s;wer, being &s;till in &s;ome Di&s;order, and particularly afraid for the Child that was with her; yet he ob&s;erv'd afterwards that &s;he bow'd two or three times to him very re&s;pectfully.</P>
<P>The Boats being clear, the Captain's Boat, which was Oars, and con&s;equently had two Watermen, went before the Maid's Boat, which was but a Scul|ler; and as he pa&s;&s;ed by, looking at the Wench, he thought he knew her Face, but did not call to mind who &s;he was; however, he had not gone far, but he recollected his Memory, and it came into his thoughts that it was <HI>Margy:</HI> Upon which he &s;top'd the Boat, and &s;poke to her, and &s;oon found that it was <HI>Margy</HI> indeed.</P>
<P>He ask'd her where &s;he liv'd; and &s;he told him in the Country, not far from <HI>Warwick.</HI> He ask'd her, if &s;he had that Child in keeping? &s;he &s;aid, Yes, and two more: That her Ma&s;ter, who was a Baronet, and his Lady, were both at <HI>Greenwich;</HI> and &s;he was &s;ent up to their Lodging in <HI>London</HI> with that Child, becau&s;e it was not well. He enquir'd where her Ma|&s;ter's
<PB N="357" REF="368">
Lodging was; and told her, he mu&s;t needs &s;peak with her; and that if &s;he could be &s;par'd to come to his Hou&s;e the next Day, he de&s;ir'd &s;he would, and bring the Gentlewoman with her la&s;t &s;poken of, who was with her when he fir&s;t &s;poke to her. She told him, &s;he believ'd &s;he could not be &s;par'd &s;o &s;oon; but that the fir&s;t Day &s;he could get any Time &s;he would wait on him. And as he was going away &s;he told him, &s;he humbly thank'd him for his having been &s;o mindful of her, as to &s;end her a Sum of Money, which &s;he was in no Means able to de&s;erve. He told her, part of his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to enquire what &s;he had done to de&s;erve it; and that tho he did not que|&s;tion but &s;he had done her Part, yet he wanted the Satisfaction of knowing what Succe&s;s &s;he had: Then he ask'd her, how much &s;he had receiv'd; &s;he told him, five Guineas. Well <HI>Margy,</HI> &s;aid he, but you were to blame not to leave word whither you were gone; for I &s;ent you Ten more, but my Wife could by no Means find you out; however, &s;ays he, it &s;hall not be your Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>He row'd away again, but could not be &s;atisfy'd to leave her till he had talk'd with her effectually; &s;o he row'd back a &s;econd time, and ask'd her, if &s;he could not as well be &s;par'd now as at another time for half an Hour's Di&s;cour&s;e, or thereabouts; and that being near the Place where the Gentlewoman liv'd, if &s;he would land and go thither, he would come to her to the Hou&s;e; &s;he readily agreed to it, and he came accordingly: Where the following Dialogue may give &s;ome Account of their Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>Well <HI>Margy,</HI> it's no matter for that, I pro|mis'd you Wages for GOD too, as I hired you for the Work of GOD; and I &s;ent it you too, but my Wife could not find you; but you &s;hall not lo&s;e it; here, bear Witne&s;s that I have paid you your Wages, and the Lord reward your Labour of Love to that poor <HI>ORPHAN, for &s;uch he was;</HI> I &s;ay, the Lord give you his Ble&s;&s;ing, and reward you for it, both here and for ever.</P>

<P>Sir, I neither expected this, nor can I &s;ay I have de&s;erved any Part of it.</P>

<P>I think you have fully de&s;erv'd it, <HI>Margy;</HI> and <HI>may the eternal Judge at the Great Day, &s;ay to you, That fora&s;much as you did this to that little One, you did it unto him,</HI> and reward you openly.</P>

<P>She bow'd in token of her Thanks to him; but could not &s;peak, her Heart was &s;o overcome with what he had &s;aid to her.</P>

<P>Sir, I find <HI>Margy</HI> makes Con&s;cience of lea|ving her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who gives her no Cau&s;e to di&s;|like her Service; and I de&s;ire, in <HI>Margy</HI>'s Favour, that you will not pre&s;s her in any Ca&s;e, where &s;he thinks it not ju&s;t.</P>

<SP>

<P>Well, <HI>Margy,</HI> I won't pre&s;s you any farther; but this I de&s;ire you to promi&s;e me, that you will come to me when you are free from your Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>Why, truly Sir, I cannot but &s;ay &s;he is very &s;trait in that Point, and yet, &s;trictly &s;peaking, &s;he is but ju&s;t.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not de&s;ire you to pu&s;h it; for if &s;he really &s;cruples it in point of Con&s;cience, you won't bring her to it, if you would give her all you have in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you &s;o; why that makes me &s;till more po&s;itive to have her, if it be po&s;&s;ible; and I have one Way left, which I believe will not fail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Way is that pray? I know none unle&s;s you would make a Wife of her; and, I hope, you do not think of that, for your Family's &s;ake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if I &s;hould, I think &s;he de&s;erves the Re&s;pect and Affection of any thing that loves and va|lues
<PB N="362" REF="373">
a Principle not to be imitated in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, if you will do &s;o, I doubt not but her Lady will con&s;ent to di&s;mi&s;s her; and, I con|fe&s;s, I have been afraid you have that in your Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ay I have it in my Thoughts; but if I &s;hould, I &s;hould do it purely for my Children: She that has been &s;uch a voluntary Mother to that Child, from a meer Principle of Con&s;cience, cannot fail to be a Mother to my Children, if I &s;hould add &s;uch an Obligation as that of making her my Wife; be&s;ides, &s;he is to be valu'd for her exact Ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Captain, &s;he wants nothing to make her a compleat Wife, but Money; for, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he came of a very good Family, and has been very well bred, tho her Parents are low; and yet I can|not advi&s;e to it, for many Rea&s;ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what your Rea&s;ons are; you &s;ay &s;he wants nothing but Money, and I want every thing but Money; and &s;he is then the be&s;t Wife for me, and I am the be&s;t Husband for her; but the&s;e Things are remote, and may never happen; in the mean Time, I am &s;ure my Children want &s;uch a Mother, tho I do not want &s;uch a Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are abundance of Changes and Unea|&s;ine&s;&s;es always attend &s;uch unequal Marriages; I would never advi&s;e any good Man to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the hazard of the Change of his Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You bring me involuntarily into &s;uch a Di&s;|cour&s;e; I tell you plainly I have no &s;uch View.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am afraid for you, and was from the Beginning, and that made me mention it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If ever I &s;hould think of &s;uch a Thing, I &s;hall do it from a Principle that is not apt to change; I can have Wives enough with good Fortunes, my own Circum&s;tances make it rational to expect I
<PB N="363" REF="374">
could; but then I ru&s;h like a Hor&s;e into the Battle, and venture upon I know not what; I know <HI>Margy</HI> has a Principle of Virtue and of Religion, and is Mi&s;tre&s;s of the be&s;t Family-Conduct that ever I met with, and this is what I want in a Wife more than Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why may not a Woman be found as well qualify'd with a Fortune as without; I cannot &s;ee the Rea&s;on of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, it is po&s;&s;ible; but where is the Per&s;on, and how great is the Hazard? Here I know, is the Woman that is &s;o qualify'd; and if &s;he be not rich, if I can make her rich, is it not the &s;ame thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay a great Stre&s;s upon the Wife's Part, as if your whole Happine&s;s depended upon her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I think it does &s;o, but e&s;pecially mine, who have four Children to be taken care of Soul and Body; if I have a Wife that neglects my Children, I am undone, I &s;hall abhor the Sight of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I confe&s;s <HI>Margy</HI> &s;eems to be qualify'd for that Work; &s;he will love your Children, I dare &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know this of <HI>Margy,</HI> that if &s;he &s;hould not take care of them from a Principle of Affection, &s;he will from a Principle of Con&s;cience; I do not expect &s;he &s;hould have the Affection of a Mother, but I dare &s;ay &s;he will do the Duty of a Mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOD forbid I &s;hould injure <HI>Margy</HI> &s;o much as to go about to le&s;&s;en your Value for her, either as a Wife, or as a Servant; I verily think &s;he will de|&s;erve as well as any One in her Circum&s;tances: But I am for your own Sake, and your Family's Sake, moving you again&s;t &s;uch a kind of Marriage in gene|ral, as unequal and apt to be unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, that is not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; my De&s;ire at pre&s;ent is to get her to take the
<PB N="364" REF="375">
Charge of my Family upon her, while I am abroad; and I beg two Things of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any thing, Sir, but to make a Propo&s;al of Marriage for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't offer it now, nor do I think of it, if &s;he will but come and take Care of my Children; I am a going abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee plainly you will have her afterward, and of the two, you had better take her before; for a Widower marrying his own Maid, is not a Thing the cleare&s;t from Reflection of any in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you I have no Thought of it now, nor, if ever I &s;hould, I &s;hall not till I have been a|nother Voyage, which, I tell you, I am now re&s;olv'd upon, and who knows what may fall out in that Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I heard you &s;ay you had re&s;olv'd to leave off the Sea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had re&s;olv'd &s;o indeed, while my Wife was alive; but I have lo&s;t the Delight of my Eyes, and &s;ince that I have chang'd my Mind, and re&s;olve to go to the <HI>Indies</HI> again, and this makes me &s;o willing to have this Maid to manage my Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will do my utmo&s;t to an&s;wer your End that Way, provided there is nothing of the other in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you there is not; I do not purpo&s;e &s;o much as to mention it to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then would you have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;ire you would talk to <HI>Margy</HI> again, and get her if you can; and if &s;he will not come without it, go to her Lady, and &s;ee if you can obtain her Con&s;ent to it; perhaps when &s;he knows the Circum|&s;tances, &s;he will part with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't &s;ay one Word of the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am content, and indeed de&s;ire you would not; for it's what may never happen.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="365" REF="376">
The Gentlewoman accordingly went the next Morning to <HI>Margy,</HI> where her Lady being not come up from <HI>Greenwich,</HI> &s;he had full Lei&s;ure to di&s;cour&s;e with her, and between them began the following Dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Margy,</HI> I fancy you wonder a little what has brought me to &s;ee you this Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I do Madam, I hope you have no bad News; pray is my old little Governour well? have you heard from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Margy,</HI> I have no bad News; I have not heard lately; I believe he is well, he is in the Country; but I came to talk with you about Ye&s;ter|day's Bu&s;ine&s;s, and your refu&s;ing to &s;erve Capt. &mdash;; you know <HI>Margy</HI> he has been very civil to you, without the lea&s;t Obligation, and if I am not mi&s;in|form'd, he made you a very fine Compliment Ye&s;ter|day, upon the old Account of your Service to my little Cou&s;in, your Governour, as you call him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, that is very true; he gave me a Sum I was a&s;ham'd to receive, and what to do I know not; I would as willingly come into his Fa|mily, as into any Family I know in the World, be|cau&s;e I know he is a very religious good Man, and has four poor Motherle&s;s Children, prettily brought up hitherto; for his Wife was an extraordinary Mother, and the Children are quite out of all Management now, and may be ruin'd: But what can I do, Ma|dam, to come away from my Lady without any ju&s;t Cau&s;e, and a Lady that not only u&s;es me well, but depends upon me for the Managing her Family, and e&s;pecially of her Children? I think 'tis the mo&s;t un|ju&s;t Part a Servant can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know what to &s;ay to that, <HI>Margy;</HI> but it mu&s;t be done if it be po&s;&s;ible; the Captain has &s;o much Dependance upon it, that he will never think his Children taken due Care of, unle&s;s they are
<PB N="366" REF="377">
in your Hands: I believe you may have any Wages you will ask of him; nay, I have Power to offer you, that whatever Wages you have here, he will double it, therefore do not be in a &s;trait about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I was free, Madam, I &s;hould be in no &s;trait; for I &s;hould undertake it as &s;oon as you had &s;poken of it; and as I am not free, Madam, I am in no &s;trait neither, for I cannot do it with a &s;afe Con|&s;cience, and no Body &s;hould be in a &s;trait to refu&s;e every thing on that Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>Margy,</HI> what if I &s;hould get your Lady's Con&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's quite another Ca&s;e, Madam; if my Lady is willing, I ought in ju&s;tice to &s;erve the Cap|tain's Family before any other; for I have many Obli|gations on me which you know of, both from him and his Wife too, when &s;he was living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Margy,</HI> I know you have; but the Captain does not in&s;i&s;t upon that, you know he gave you that Money on another Account; he gave it fir&s;t to engage you to do your Part con&s;cienciou&s;ly with my little Kin&s;man, and after, as a Reward for your faithful di&s;charge of your Duty; I wi&s;h all faithful Servants had the like Encouragement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did nothing but what was my Duty, and what that dear little Creature would have forc'd any one almo&s;t to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it is an Encouragement however to all Servants to be hone&s;t and careful, and to di&s;charge their Duty well; you &s;ee GOD will find Ways to have them rewarded even in this World, and if they who are concern'd will not do it, Strangers &s;hall; the Captain had no more Concern in that Child, or in that Family, than you had, before you were their Servant, only did it in a Principle of generous Cha|rity to the Soul of the poor Child, who he &s;aw a|bandon'd by its own Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="367" REF="378">
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, Madam, it was all Charity in him; but I look farther, I think it was all from a higher Hand, both to the Child and to me: I am per&s;waded that Child has been the peculiar Care of Heaven from its Infancy; and as to me, I ble&s;s GOD I ever had the Charge of him; not that I have done the Child &s;o much good as another might have done it; but I am &s;ure the Child has been a Means to do me a great deal of good, it had &s;omething of the highe&s;t Principles of Chri&s;tianity in it from the very Cradle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now <HI>Margy,</HI> it is from the &s;ame Principle of Chri&s;tian Affection to the Soul of his own Children, be&s;ides his fatherly Concern for them, that the Cap|tain de&s;ires you to come and take Care of them; their Mother is gone, and he talks of going to Sea again, tho if his Wife had liv'd, he did not intend it; and he cannot go away with any Peace, if his Children are not left in &s;ome Hand that he can be ea&s;y with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a great Charge, Madam, for me to take upon me; if there was but one, I could do it pretty well, and &s;hould do my Endeavour; but four Chil|dren, and all of them &s;mall Ones, is a Burthen too heavy for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will let you have what Help you can de|&s;ire, <HI>Margy;</HI> you &s;hall have no le&s;s than two Servants under you; he only wants you to have the Govern|ment of them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, I can &s;ay no more than this, if my Lady, that I am now with, di&s;mi&s;&s;es me, I &s;hall be willing to do what I can.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Cou&s;in was faithful to her Word, and took not the lea&s;t Notice of her Di&s;cour&s;e with the Cap|tain; neither would &s;he &s;ay any more to her at that Time, re&s;olving to talk with her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and knowing where the Lady was at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> &s;he immediately takes Boat and goes down to her, and tells her the
<PB N="368" REF="379">
whole Story of <HI>Margy</HI> and the Captain, as it related to the Child &s;he had tended before, and the Captain's De&s;ire now to have her for the Conduct of his own Children; and, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I come from the Captain to beg your Lady&s;hip's Con&s;ent to part with her.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, you come of the mo&s;t un|welcome Me&s;&s;age in the World; the Captain is in the right to de&s;ire her, and &s;ignifies to me that he is <HI>a true Father</HI> to his Children; but I &s;hould be <HI>as ill a Mother</HI> to mine if I &s;hould part with her, for &s;ure there never was &s;uch a Servant in any One's Hou&s;e, and therefore, Madam, if you have any Sen&s;e of Ju|&s;tice, do not attempt to rob me of a Servant that I take to be as <HI>Jacob</HI> was to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Laban, (viz.)</HI> a Ble&s;&s;ing to my Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you put me to the greate&s;t &s;trait in the World, I &s;carce know how to act in &s;uch an Af|fair; but the Captain has laid great Obligations up|on <HI>Margy,</HI> and &s;he ought a little to con&s;ider them.</P>

<P>Nay, Madam, I hope you will not tamper with her, to entice her away.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, Madam, neither is &s;he to be tamper'd with; if &s;he were to have ten Times the Wages you give her, &s;he will never come from you without your Leave.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed Madam, I mu&s;t do her that Ju&s;tice; &s;he is &s;o &s;trait-lac'd in that Point, that &s;he would not give her Con&s;ent that I &s;hould come to ask you: She &s;ays you have been very good to her, and &s;he has no|thing to complain of; and tho &s;he owns her Obliga|tion to the Captain and his Family, and tho he of|fered to double her Wages, &s;he &s;ays &s;he cannot in

Con&s;cience quit your Family, where &s;he thinks you have &s;ome little Dependance on her Service among your Children; nothing can bring her to it but your Con&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then your Bu&s;ine&s;s is at an end; for the Captain may be &s;atisfied, that the very &s;ame Rea&s;on which makes him de&s;ire to have her, makes me de&s;ire to keep her; and you may be a&s;&s;ured you will never have my Con&s;ent, no hardly, if he would marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Madam, I fore&s;aw it before I came, and &s;o did the Captain; and if I had not had &s;ome|thing to &s;ay which I did believe you could not re&s;i&s;t, I had not given you this Trouble. It was evident, the Maid would not &s;tir without your Di&s;mi&s;s; and we knew no Lady that had any Affection for her Children, and Sen&s;e of the Manner with which this Maid behaves her &s;elf among Children, would part with her; and therefore I mu&s;t own it is my Opi|nion, tho I am not empower'd to tell you &s;o po&s;itive|ly, that rather than his Children &s;hall want &s;uch a Teacher, he will, one Time or other, make her their Mother.</P>

<P>I tell you, this Maid has been Father, Mo|ther, Nur&s;e, School-mi&s;tre&s;s, every Thing to my Children; &s;he is a Pattern to all the Servants in the

<STAGE>Here &s;he relates to her the Conduct of the Maid with the little Child her Cou&s;in.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of her Rules is, that when a Maid-Servant takes upon her to tend little Children, it is her Duty to in&s;truct and teach them, as well as tend and wait upon them. I wi&s;h all Maid-Servants ob|&s;erved the &s;ame Method.</P>

<P>Indeed Madam, I believe few Maid-Ser|vants mind that part much.</P>

<P>On the contrary, they teach Children little &s;imple Songs, bad Words, ill Habits and Cu&s;toms; but this Wench is &s;uch a con&s;cientious Creature, &s;he makes Children Chri&s;tians even before they know what a Chri&s;tian is; &s;he teaches them the Fear and Knowledge of GOD, even before &s;he is able to make them read.</P>

<P><HI>Alter'd Madam!</HI> my Children are quite ano|ther &s;ort of Creatures &s;ince &s;he has had them; &s;he infu&s;es Things in&s;en&s;ibly into them; they learn Man|ners, Duty and Religion, all together, of her. I have a little Child here, my Daughter, that is but five Year old, and I am &s;ure when it came to her it had learn'd nothing but little fooli&s;h An&s;wers to common Que&s;tions, which it under&s;tood nothing of when it &s;poke, and a great many little &s;imple Songs which were &s;carce fit for Children to repeat; but now we hear nothing at all of-them.</P>

<P>I made the Child lie with me one Night, <HI>Margy</HI> being away, and I put her to Bed my &s;elf, not caring to tru&s;t any other Servant; when I had almo&s;t un|dre&s;s'd her, &s;he pull'd me, and pull'd me two or three Times, and I could not imagine what the Child meant: At la&s;t &s;he look'd up in my Face very &s;teadi|ly, but &s;aid nothing; and &s;till I did not under&s;tand the Child. When &s;he could find no way to make me know what &s;he meant without &s;peaking, &s;he &s;ays two or three times over, <HI>Down Mamma, down Mamma: Down My Dear, &s;aid I,</HI> what mu&s;t I &s;it down for?

So &s;tupid a Fool was I all this while that I could not yet imagine what the Child meant! So it &s;aid again, <HI>Down here Mamma,</HI> and points to the Floor; not dreaming yet what &s;he meant, I laugh'd at her; <HI>What, mu&s;t I &s;it upon the Floor?</HI> ye &s;imple little Rogue you, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> no, no, I'll &s;it here. With that the Child looking mighty grave, and a little tending to|wards crying, &s;ays to me, <HI>Down &s;o Mamma,</HI> and claps down upon its Knees. This a little &s;tartled me: O <HI>my Dear,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I did not under&s;tand thee: Come then, kneel down and &s;ay your Prayers.</HI> It would not do yet, this was not what the Child meant. <HI>No Mamma,</HI> &s;ays the Child, <HI>you kneel down, &s;ay Prayers.</HI></P>

Then Tears bur&s;t out of my Eyes in &s;pight of my Re&s;i|&s;tance, and I took the poor little Creature in my Arms, and kneel'd down with it, and pray'd to GOD to ble&s;s it as well as I could; for I was hardly able to &s;peak a Word.</P>

Judge you, Madam, what a Sight this was to a Mother that really had never had any hand in the happy In|&s;truction that had brought it to this.

To cut &s;hort this Part of the Story, the End of which is to in&s;truct Servants in what is their Duty, when little Children come into their Hands, that they are to do more than Dre&s;s and Undre&s;s them: and to encourage them to it, I &s;ay this was the End of this Part. But to cut it &s;hort; when <HI>Margy</HI> had heard by her Lady, that there had been &s;ome Di&s;|cour&s;e of the Captain making her his Wife, &s;he was more aver&s;e to going away than before, re&s;olving not to be a Servant in his Family upon any Terms what&s;oever: So the Di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e Things broke off, and it was not till two Year after, that the Cap|tain returning again from Sea, found her out and marry'd her. Indeed &s;he was his Wife when the Youth (for he was then 14 Year old,) who &s;he had fir&s;t brought up, being Fatherle&s;s and Motherle&s;s, <HI>as is noted above,</HI> was, by the Cour&s;e of his Father's Will, left to the Care of the Captain; and he know|ing how grateful it would be to his Wife, as well as from a &s;incere Affection to the Child, took him Home, and made him like one of his own.</P>
<P>Here he was u&s;ed with &s;uch an Affection, &s;uch Tenderne&s;s, and &s;uch Care, that he was far from ha|ving any Lo&s;s either of Father or Mother; and after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> had been furni&s;hed with all the needful Parts of Learning to fit him for the Work, became a Mini&s;ter; and prov'd an extraordinary Man, as well for Piety and Principle, as Capacity; and the Captain, to make him finally and effectually his own, marry'd him to his elde&s;t Daughter, with whom he received a very comfortable Fortune of 8000 <HI>l.</HI> Thus Providence fi|ni&s;h'd the Work which was in &s;o eminent a Manner begun in this Child, &s;ingling him out from his Infancy, to be an Honour and Encouragement to the Profe&s;&s;i|on of Religion, and qualifying him even in his Infan|cy to be an In&s;tructor of others; &s;o that he might be &s;aid to be a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel from his Cradle.</P>

<P>On the other Hand, all Family-Religion was per|fectly de&s;troy'd; for tho' at fir&s;t the Man began well enough, and having been religiou&s;ly educated, ap|pear'd in his Family like one re&s;olv'd to have a well|order'd Hou&s;e, yet as our Pa&s;&s;ions like a &s;trong Di|&s;temper always encrea&s;e with our Years, &s;o the Occa|&s;ions perhaps returning oftner, as his Family and Bu&s;ine&s;s encrea&s;ed, and e&s;pecially by his giving way to them, they gained more upon him, as he grew older: His Fits of Rage returned oftner, dwelt longer upon him, made him more and more &s;ubject to be provoked, and longer a cooling, when heated; till in &s;hort it became a meer Di&s;ea&s;e in his Blood, a Di&s;|order of his Con&s;titution, and not only could not be cur'd, but render'd his Temper almo&s;t unconver|&s;able.</P>
<P>Among other Effects of this Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>for it pro|mis'd little le&s;s,</HI> one was this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it de&s;troy'd the very Face of Order and Religion in the Family.</P>

<P>It happen'd once, upon &s;ome trivial Offence, &s;ome|what like this of your Son, that he was in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion with one of his Sons, then but a Boy, and was ju&s;t going to &s;trike him with <HI>a great Bar,</HI> which he had &s;natch'd up <HI>in his hast,</HI> and which, had he &s;truck him with it, mu&s;t have kill'd him, or at be&s;t very much have brui&s;ed him.

<P>A good pre&s;ent Effect; it melted him into Tears, and even into a Pa&s;&s;ion at him&s;elf, for being &s;uch a Slave to his furious Temper; and he made a great many Vows and Promi&s;es to bridle his Anger for the future.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Truly, but a very little while! Vows and Promi&s;es are a weak Guard, where Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance does not join its Power. It was not a Month after, when, upon a very little Provocation, he fell upon another of his Sons, and was &s;o blinded with his Pa&s;&s;ion, that his Wife, running in to &s;ave the Child, got a great Blow on her Shoulder and Brea&s;t, which bruis'd her very much, and laid her up for two Months after, and it was greatly fear'd &s;he would have had a Cancer in her Brea&s;t.</P>

<P>You make me tremble at the Reflection, it is &s;o very natural, and is &s;o much my own Ca&s;e; why, it has driven me from my Duty, and kept off my Performance for Weeks together; be&s;ides the Shame, the Difficulty, the Reluctance of coming to it again when the whole Family has known the Rea&s;on of its being omitted.</P>

<P>I'll give you &s;ome &s;hort In&s;tances of it in this Family, which perhaps may &s;erve as well to ho|nour the Conduct of the Wife, as to leave an Ex|ample to all Ma&s;ters of Families not to give way to the Violence of their own ungovern'd Follies. Her Husband, by the Violence of his Temper, embroil'd him&s;elf &s;everal Times, and on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, in very unhappy Quarrels; I do not mean &s;uch as were to be decided <HI>by Hand,</HI> or that requir'd him to u&s;e his Sword, <HI>as a Gentleman;</HI> for being a Citizen, he wore no Sword, nor had he much occa&s;ion to deal with tho&s;e that did.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I do not under&s;tand you &s;o; if he had &s;hown his pa&s;&s;ionate Temper among Gentlemen, as you &s;ay he did to Others, he might have found a &s;hort Way out of the World, and put his Family &s;oon out of their Pain.</P>

<P>But he &s;hew'd it &s;o among other People, that he brought innumerable Law-Suits upon his Hands, and mu&s;t have been ruin'd, if his Wife's Prudence had not put a &s;top to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could &s;he do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he got Friends to go and make up Breaches, and repair Damages, where it was po&s;&s;ible to make them up; and that &s;he did &s;o often, till &s;he was tir'd with it; and finding no End of the Mi&s;|chief, there being no hopes to put an end to the Cau&s;e, &s;he per&s;uaded him fir&s;t to take his elde&s;t Son into his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and after &s;ome time, his &s;econd Son, and then to leave it quite off to them, and retire.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Truly, not without many a rude &s;cuffle with his Temper, and indeed with her Sons too; for the Father, tho' he was not in&s;en&s;ible of his own pa&s;&s;io|nate

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, it did look &s;omewhat hard; how|ever, as it was done deliberately, and with a mature Acknowledgement that he was unfit to conver&s;e with the World, by rea&s;on of his want of Govern|ment of him&s;elf, and that it was fini&s;h'd and done &s;ome Time, it could not be rea&s;onable to turn the young Men out of Bu&s;ine&s;s again, tho' it was at the De|mand of their Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, his Violence, and their Unwilling|ne&s;s to di&s;oblige or ob&s;truct their Father, made all Things ea&s;y that way. It happen'd one Day, that he had been at <HI>London</HI> with his Sons, and in their Ware|hou&s;e, for he had taken a Hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Town; but when he went to Town, u&s;ed to go and &s;it in his Sons Compting-Hou&s;e, to do any Bu&s;ine&s;s of his own, or divert him&s;elf with them: Here he &s;aw their Bu&s;ine&s;s went on flouri&s;hing and &s;ucce&s;sful, af|ter another Rate than ever it did under his Manage|ment; and a &s;trange Unea&s;ine&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;t his Mind at the Sight; in&s;tead of rejoycing that his Sons minded their Bu&s;ine&s;s, agreed, and went Hand in Hand, that they Throve well, and that Bu&s;ine&s;s flowed in upon them; I &s;ay, in&s;tead of rejoycing at this Pro|&s;perity of his Family, which a true Father of his Children would have e&s;teem'd his own, a Spirit of Envy and Di&s;content &s;eized him, and he went away chagrine and melancholy.</P>
<P>When he came Home, his Wife perceiv'd a Cloud of Di&s;content &s;at upon his Countenance; and tho' &s;he was full of Apprehen&s;ion that he was under &s;ome violent Di&s;turbance, yet being willing to abate it as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;he went chearfully to him, and &s;miling, ask'd him how he did; he gave her little or no An&s;wer at fir&s;t, but after &s;ome other little En|quiries,
<PB N="391" REF="402">
he flew out upon her with the greate&s;t Fury imaginable, told her, it was &s;he that had &s;upplanted him in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, made him an Invalid to his Fa|mily, and a Pen&s;ioner to his Children; that her Sons were engro&s;&s;ing the Wealth of the Family, and ta|king that Encrea&s;e which was his Right; and that &s;he had confederated with them to draw him into a Snare, but added, that he would break all the Con|trivances that were made u&s;e of to abu&s;e him.</P>
<P>She could ea&s;ily have an&s;wer'd every Objection, and with great Di&s;advantage to him; but &s;he &s;aw he was out of Temper, and &s;he had too much Wi&s;|dom to throw Oil into the Fire; but &s;he an&s;wer'd calmly, that as far as &s;he had any Hand in it, &s;he could not but &s;ee that it was for his Advantage, and the good of his Family, that &s;he had acted; but that &s;he would, with the &s;ame Zeal, join with him to break any Contrivance that was for his hurt.</P>
<Q><P>Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> do you talk &s;o? Is it not to my hurt to &s;ee my Sons &s;et above me, and, as it were, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing my Inheritance before it falls to them? Could they not have &s;taid till my Head was laid?</P><SP>

<P>It was but a few Minutes afterwards, but he came him&s;elf, and entering the Warehou&s;e, he found his Sons both there, but very bu&s;y with Cu&s;tomers, &s;o he went into the Compting-hou&s;e, and &s;at &s;till a while; but his Pa&s;&s;ion was too hot to be kept within Bounds, and his elde&s;t Son, who &s;aw by his Countenance that his Father was very much di&s;turbed, made all the Di&s;patch po&s;&s;ible to get clear of the People he

<P>He was not touch'd with it at all at fir&s;t; but taking his Sons, <HI>as it were,</HI> at their Words, he im|mediately took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Books and Ca&s;h, and the Sons, with the greate&s;t Calmne&s;s and apparent Satisfaction, threw off their Hats, and put them|&s;elves into the Po&s;ture of Servants: His greate&s;t Di&s;&s;atisfaction was, that he could not have the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion to be angry.</P>
<P>After he had chaft his Mind as much, and indeed more than the Ca&s;e would bear, and had thus em|barra&s;s'd him&s;elf into the Hurry of the World again; &s;o that he &s;aw him&s;elf, in a few Moments, a Man remov'd from a plea&s;ant agreeable Retreat, fully en|gag'd again in a va&s;t Crowd of Incumbrances; the Pro&s;pect began to appear le&s;s agreeable to him than he thought it before, and full of Di&s;content he comes away, having been perfectly di&s;appointed of the Quar|rel which he expected to have with his two Sons.</P>
<P>When he came Home again, he thinks to gratify the Fury of his Temper upon his Wife; his Spirits were in agitation, and Nature requir'd to give them a Vent &s;omewhere; the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive re&s;pectful Con|duct of his Sons had effectually di&s;appointed him there, and even for want of an Object, he re&s;olves to fall upon his Wife; accordingly, as &s;oon as he comes Home, he begins with her, very hot and angry &s;till.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Dear, it's unkind to &s;peak of Mea&s;ures of mine; if you have done no Injury to your &s;elf, you can have done none to me, I have no Intere&s;t but yours, nor any Mea&s;ures but what you have been all along acquainted with, unle&s;s it has been to pre|vent your hurting your &s;elf.</P>

<P>No indeed, my Dear, nor had ever any &s;uch Thought; Can I be capable of &s;uch a Thing? Can a Husband be ruin'd without his Wife?</P>

<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever you have been capable of, <HI>thank God,</HI> I am capable of di&s;appointing you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will &s;peak kindlier when your Pa&s;&s;ion is over; your Charge is very heavy, and it is a &s;ad Ca&s;e, where the Judge has not Temper or Patience to hear the Per&s;on accu&s;ed.</P>

<P>I your Judge! I am none of your Judge; there's one above will judge you all.</P>

<P>If you condemn me, you make your &s;elf my Judge, and I ought to be calmly heard.</P>

<P>Oh! you want to talk with your Coun&s;ellors, I have di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them of their Authority, and I'll take care to keep them from caballing with you again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we had caball'd again&s;t you, as we did for you, you could not have di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them; you treat me as your Enemy, <HI>my Dear,</HI> but you will find I have been your Friend, and a faithful Friend too, even in this very Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I value neither your Friend&s;hip or your En|mity; I am Ma&s;ter of my Family again once more, and I'll be &s;o as long as I live.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h, <HI>my Dear,</HI> you were Ma&s;ter of your &s;elf as much as we all de&s;ire you &s;hould be Ma&s;ter of every thing in your Family.</P>

<P>That is to my &s;elf, and the Hurt is my own if I am not.</P>

<P><HI>My Dear,</HI> your Words are very bitter, I know not what you have done; I am &s;ure I have done nothing to your Prejudice, and you cannot have di&s;appointed me in any thing, unle&s;s it be in hurt|ing your &s;elf and your Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have di&s;appointed you; I have turn'd out your two Partners, and made my two Ma&s;ters my two Servants again, as they ought to be.</P>

<P>Yes, yes; they gave it up with Readine&s;s enough, that's true.</P>

<P>Why then, <HI>my Dear,</HI> they have &s;hewn them|&s;elves very full of Duty and Regard to their Father, you mu&s;t own that; for you know you could not have obliged them to it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the le&s;s obliged to you however, who took Care to put it &s;o much out of my Power, that if they had been le&s;s dutiful than they are, I might have been u&s;ed bad enough.</P>

<P>Do not &s;trive, <HI>my Dear,</HI> to load me with Re|proaches, I have Affliction enough.</P>

<P>You will acknowledge all that to your Wife, <HI>my Dear,</HI> when you come to think calmly, and know a little more of it; but I'll take another Opportu|nity to convince you of it, perhaps in a little Time you will repent your pre&s;ent Proceedings.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what &s;aid he for it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! he was the greate&s;t <ADD>Penitent for it,</ADD> that ever you heard of, and continu'<ADD>d so as long as</ADD> he liv'd; but what was that to the po<ADD>or Man?</ADD></P>

<P>Yes, yes, he provided fo<ADD>r him and for his</ADD> Family too; but tho' that was a g<ADD>reat weight upon</ADD> his own Family, yet it was no S<ADD>atisfaction to the</ADD>

<P><ADD>And did h</ADD>e govern him&s;elf better afterwards?</P>

<P><ADD>It is</ADD> true; but of all the kinds, I think, <HI>Fa|<ADD>mily Pa&s;&s;ions</ADD></HI> are the wor&s;t; they generally are in <ADD>their beginni</ADD>ngs more extravagant, ri&s;e to the great|<ADD>est Height, a</ADD>re acted with the greate&s;t Violence, <ADD>and attended w</ADD>ith the wor&s;t Con&s;equences; as I could <ADD>&s;hew you by</ADD> many &s;ad Examples within the Com|<ADD>pa&s;s of my ow</ADD>n knowledge, but the Stories are too <ADD>long to relate n</ADD>ow.</P>
