<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THIS Di&s;cour&s;e, when drawn up, was not inten|ded for publication; the Author never flattering him&s;elf with the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea that any thing he could write was de&s;erving of the public notice. His compliance with the wi&s;hes of &s;ome worthy friends in the Pari&s;h to publi&s;h it was, that it might &s;erve as an in&s;trument for conveying the names of tho&s;e worthy benefactors, who have contributed &s;o liberally and cheafully towards rebuilding the church, and, at the &s;ame time, to obviate the objections generally made to briefs, by a view of the net-produce of &s;o large a &s;um received by this.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides expre&s;&s;ing, by this public information, the &s;en&s;e of gratitude the Pari&s;h is under to &s;uch eminent friends, the Author is al&s;o inclinable to hope, that the pro&s;pect of &s;uch uncommon genero&s;ity may be an inducement to others, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, "to go and do likewi&s;e," and may afford &s;ome encouragement and direction to &s;ufferers labouring under &s;imilar calamities.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020020050000030">This Di&s;cour&s;e, publi&s;hed with the&s;e motives, will &s;erve likewi&s;e, as a &s;mall te&s;timony of the regard the Author entertains for his pari&s;hioners; whom he begs to accept of his warme&s;t wi&s;hes for their temporal and &s;piritual welfare, and to admit his &s;ituation as an apology for not vi&s;iting them oftner, &s;ubject as he is to tho&s;e prior and &s;tronger obligations he feels him&s;elf under to the kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean and Chapter of Roche&s;ter.</NOTE> friends who conferred on him the living; who&s;e favors it &s;hall ever be his &s;tudy and plea&s;ure to acknowledge with the &s;incere&s;t gra|titude.&mdash;</P>

<BIBL>PSALM cxxii, Ver&s;e 1.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;I was glad when they &s;aid unto me, let us go into the Hou&s;e of the Lord.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is generally agreed that this P&s;alm, to which the&s;e words are an introduction, was compo&s;ed for the u&s;e of the People of I&s;rael at their three public and &s;o|lemn fe&s;tivals, namely, of Pa&s;&s;over, Penteco&s;t, and Tabernacles; when they were &s;trictly obliged by their law to come from all parts of Judea, and to appear before the Lord at Jeru&s;alem. At which times they were particularly commanded to offer, together with their &s;acrifices, their united tribute of prai&s;e and adoration to God in his temple built and &s;et apart for his more immediate &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="020020050000050">WE can hardly entertain any idea of religion without the appropriation of particular places for the more &s;o|lemn exerci&s;es of it; where &s;ocieties of men a&s;&s;emble together to pre&s;ent "with one heart and one voice" their joint &s;acrifice of homage, reverence, and affectionate acknowledgments to one common parent: which na|turally, at the &s;ame time, &s;erve to unite &s;uch bodies of men, already allied to one another by the &s;ame na|ture, in the clo&s;e and intimate ties of religion and be|nevolence.</P>
<P>AMONG the Jews, as their religion was taught them from Heaven, &s;o we ob&s;erve, a particular place of wor&s;hip was built, by God's expre&s;s command and direction, at Jeru&s;alem; where all their tribes were indi&s;pen&s;ibly bound to attend at &s;ome peculiar &s;ea&s;ons and &s;olemnities, &s;uch as tho&s;e I have before mentioned: and other &s;ubordinate places were erected in the country nearer and more convenient for their frequent atten|dance
<PB N="3" REF="020020050000060">
at other times. And, in time, to &s;uch lengths did the Jews carry their veneration for &s;uch religious hou&s;es, that the re&s;pect, which was at fir&s;t enjoined to be &s;hewn them by the Supreme Being for the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es, (as we are mo&s;t &s;ure all his command|ments are) degenerated at la&s;t into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;uper|&s;tition. They thought that the attention which they paid to the Hou&s;e of God di&s;pen&s;ed with all other obli|gations however natural and &s;acred, and that no im|piety was &s;o great, as the profanation or even the di&s;|re&s;pectful mention of their Temple at Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>THIS was carrying things too far. Yet, that &s;uch places &s;hould "be had in honour," we may gather from numberle&s;s pa&s;&s;ages in Holy Scripture, and particu|larly from our Saviour's behaviour to the buyers and &s;ellers in the Temple; where, tho' at all other times he was mo&s;t eminent for the gentlene&s;s and meekne&s;s of his deportment, yet on this occa&s;ion he is ob&s;erved
<PB N="4" REF="020020050000070">
to have &s;hewn the greate&s;t re&s;entment towards the pro|faners of that holy place, and to have accompanied his divine exertions with this reproof, "It is written, my hou&s;e &s;hall be called of all nations the hou&s;e of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves." <HI>Mark</HI> xi. 16. 17. And &s;o &s;trict a veneration did he him&s;elf pay and in&s;i&s;ted that others &s;hould pay to it, that St. Mark ob&s;erves, that he would not &s;uffer that "any man &s;hould" even "carry any ve&s;&s;el through the Temple."</P>
<P>AND agreeably to this divine pattern, the Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t Di&s;ciples of our Lord retained and cheri&s;hed in their minds great re&s;pect and veneration for &s;uch religious edifices, and particularly for the Temple at Jeru&s;alem; where they are &s;aid, in the Acts of Apo&s;tles, "to have continued daily with one accord," <HI>Acts</HI> ii.46. even after our Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion and the de&s;cent of the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit; and they al|ways cho&s;e to repair, for religious wor&s;hip, to hou&s;es
<PB N="5" REF="020020050000080">
already dedicated to God's Service; of which there were great numbers at that time in Judea and in other neighbouring countries: and never omitted, if po&s;&s;ible, to a&s;&s;emble in&s;uch places, principally, "where prayers were wont to be made." <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 13. But when "per&s;ecution aro&s;e on account of the word," and the Jews "thought that they did God &s;ervice," not only "in putting them out of their &s;ynagogues," but al&s;o "in killing them," it is no wonder that we find them a&s;&s;embling "apart by them&s;elves for fear of the Jews," and that, as their religious tenets were become in &s;ome mea&s;ure different, they found it nece&s;&s;ary, that their places of divine wor&s;hip &s;hould be di&s;tinct al&s;o.&mdash; Notwith&s;tanding this; we ob&s;erve, that as &s;oon as they found any re&s;t from the&s;e per&s;ecutions, the primitive Chri&s;tians, conforming to the example of their Divine Ma&s;ter and his Apo&s;tles, did not indi&s;criminately u&s;e every place which pre&s;ented it&s;elf for religious pur|po&s;es, but that there were particular &s;tructures &s;oon &s;et
<PB N="6" REF="020020050000090">
apart by them, where they re&s;orted on all &s;olemn occa|&s;ions, and where they were e&s;pecially exhorted to "con|tinue &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Apo&s;tles' doctrine and fellow|&s;hip, in breaking of bread and in prayer." <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 42. And in proportion as the&s;e intervals of re&s;t from the malice of their enemies increa&s;ed, their attention to the erection of &s;uch &s;acred edifices is ob&s;erved to have in|crea&s;ed al&s;o. Wherever Chri&s;tianity was propagated, Churches were built, and the zeal of the early Chri&s;|tians was not more di&s;cernible in the purity of their lives and manners, than in their generous contribu|tions towards &s;uch undertakings.</P>
<P>BUT here we are obliged, with &s;orrow, to con&s;e&s;s, that &s;oon after the &s;ecure e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, an undue and &s;uper&s;titious veneration prevailed for &s;uch places, and &s;uch notions were annexed to them, as neither Scripture warranted, or the genuine u&s;ages of primitive Chri&s;tianity authorized; which Chri&s;tians
<PB N="7" REF="020020050000100">
at la&s;t carried &s;o far, that they, like the Jews in the degenerate and declining period of their &s;tate, thought that every virtue was compri&s;ed in an intemperate zeal for the externals of religion, in ceremonies and in loud profe&s;&s;ions of honour for the Church; which was at length rendered a refuge for, and the means of ab&s;olv|ing the mo&s;t enormous criminals.&mdash;Herein we can|not &s;ufficiently admire the wi&s;dom and moderation of the Church of England, which has &s;teered between the two dangerous extremes of &s;uper&s;tition on the one hand, and a fond &s;pirit of innovation on the other. Guided by rea&s;on, by &s;cripture, and the uncorrupted practices of early Chri&s;tianity, &s;he has retained and &s;trongly recommends a high regard for hou&s;es erected to the honour of God, and has given directions to tho&s;e whom &s;he has appointed <HI>Over&s;eers over the Church of God,</HI> to &s;et apart by prayer and decent ceremonies, the&s;e venerable Temples: And in compliance with the advice of St. Paul, "that all things &s;hould be done de|cently
<PB N="8" REF="020020050000110">
and in order" 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. 40. among her mem|bers, &s;he hath taken great care to provide &s;uch conve|niences for <HI>the a&s;&s;embling together of the People of God,</HI> and &s;uch helps and a&s;&s;i&s;tances to religion and medita|tion for them when a&s;&s;embled, as well by the accom|modation of decent religious hou&s;es, of ceremonies and a compo&s;ed form of prayer, as have procured her &s;er|vice and polity from her warme&s;t advocates the title of, "The Beauty of Holine&s;s," and from all &s;ober and well-informed Chri&s;tians both at home and abroad, the ju&s;t tribute of honour and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THUS have I mentioned &s;uch ob&s;ervations as natu|rally occurred to me at this time, and are, I hope, ap|plicable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. But &s;till I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to under&s;tand, that the&s;e accommodations, how|ever plea&s;ing and venerable in them&s;elves, are only in|&s;truments, conducive indeed to the purpo&s;es of religion, but which will &s;till prove ineffectual without &s;incere
<PB N="9" REF="020020050000120">
&s;entiments of religion and virtue in the heart, in order to make the offering here pre&s;ented, plea&s;ing to God and profitable to our&s;elves; to have it in our power to addre&s;s each his neighbour in the words of the text, with chearfulne&s;s and delight, "let us go to the hou&s;e of the Lord;" there mu&s;t be a warm, active principle of devotion in our &s;ouls; "the &s;acrifice that is holy and acceptable to the Lord is our rea&s;onable &s;ervice," the &s;ervice of the mind; for the "God," whom we wor&s;hip, "is a &s;pirit, and they that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth; for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him." <HI>John</HI> iv. 24.</P>
<P>INDEED in &s;uch &s;ituations we have every inducement to excite &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions in us. We are here a&s;&s;em|bled in the more immediate pre&s;ence of Almighty God, who has graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed, that "where two or three are gathered together in his name, he will be in the mid&s;t of them." <HI>Mathew</HI> xviii. 20. We have here a
<PB N="10" REF="020020050000130">
mini&s;ter properly prepared and commi&s;&s;ioned to inform our under&s;tandings and to a&s;&s;i&s;t our meditations. We have here a number of our fellow chri&s;tians met toge|ther for the &s;ame religious purpo&s;es; we &s;ee around us our neighbours, friends, relations and families; &s;uch as are allied to us by the tender ties of nature, friend|&s;hip and kindred, &s;upplicating the Supreme Author of their exi&s;tence, in the humble&s;t po&s;ture of adoration, for mercies &s;piritual and temporal; acknowledging the un&s;peakable obligations they are under to him for their creation, pre&s;ervation and numberle&s;s in&s;tances of his loving kindne&s;s to them; and particularly for that amazing demon&s;tration of his compa&s;&s;ion to mankind in the redemption of the world by his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Whereby truths of the utmo&s;t importance for us to know are communicated to us; every good chri&s;tian has his rea&s;onable doubts cleared up; the terms of his &s;alvation a&s;certained; and, at length, what the wi&s;e&s;t of the heathen world &s;ought before in vain and of which
<PB N="11" REF="020020050000140">
the Jews had but imperfect notions, "life and immor|tality are brought to" clear "light" by the go&s;pel.&mdash; I &s;ay, the&s;e and &s;uch like &s;entiments mu&s;t naturally ari&s;e in minds before-hand prepared for &s;uch holy ex|erci&s;es; but, at the &s;ame time, we may be well a&s;&s;ured that they are di&s;po&s;itions which cannot be expected from minds corrupted and en&s;laved by vice, and &s;tran|gers to the love of virtue and religion. To &s;uch God in his word &s;aith, "what ha&s;t thou to do to declare my &s;tatutes; or that thou &s;houlde&s;t take my covenant into thy mouth? Who hath required this at thine hand to tread my courts, &s;eeing thou hate&s;t in&s;truction and ha&s;t ca&s;t my words behind thee?" <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 1. 16. It is the pious and virtuous brea&s;t only that can declare, "Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy hou&s;e and the place where thine honour dwelleth!" <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xxvi. 8. and can with truth &s;ay, "I was glad when they &s;aid unto me, let us go to the hou&s;e of the Lord."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="020020050000150">IT is recorded in the book of Ezra, that certain old men, who had been eye-witne&s;&s;es of the grandeur of Solomon's Temple, which was de&s;troyed by the Chaldeans, after their return from captivity, when they &s;ilently ob&s;erved how widely inferior their new Temple was to their former one, could not refrain from tears at the campari&s;on. <HI>Ezra</HI> xi. 12. We have no occa|&s;ion, I believe, to be unea&s;y by any &s;uch reflections; yea, rather, we have abundant rea&s;on to be thankful that we are enabled &s;o &s;oon, after our late calamity, joyfully to meet again in our own &s;anctuary; which, if not &s;uperior to our former one, yet has every conveniency and even ornament, which can be required in a hou&s;e &s;et apart for religious purpo&s;es. Without excu&s;e mu&s;t we al&s;o be, if, on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion, we do not feel warm &s;entiments of gratitude towards tho&s;e friends, who &s;o generou&s;ly pitied our di&s;tre&s;s, relieved our nece&s;&s;ities and &s;o "far loved" us, as to have had &s;o large &s;hare in "building us a Syna|gogue."
<PB N="13" REF="020020050000160">
But &s;till mo&s;t inexcu&s;able &s;hall we be, if we do not improve the&s;e advantages to the noble&s;t purpo&s;es of religion, and make them the means of improvement to our&s;elves and others: If we do not embrace every opportunity of attending on divine wor&s;hip in God's Hou&s;e, compel tho&s;e, who are more immediately under our care, to attend there likewi&s;e, and to exhibit a deportment &s;uitable to the &s;olemnity of the place. And not only while there, but we mu&s;t in all places, and in the general cour&s;e of our lives, &s;hew an example of &s;obriety, decency, moderation, indu&s;try, ju&s;tice, hu|manity and piety; which will be the mo&s;t effectual way to enforce our admonitions and to make tho&s;e around us mo&s;t &s;trongly attached to virtue.</P>
<P>In order to lay a &s;ure foundation for &s;uch a beha|viour in the ri&s;ing generation; (the want of which is, every where, mo&s;t &s;orely lamented,) you mu&s;t, in a particular manner, be careful to habituate your children
<PB N="14" REF="020020050000170">
betimes to virtuous and religious ways; "to reverence God's &s;anctuary, and to train them up in the way that they &s;hould go, that when they are old they may not depart from it:" which will be the mo&s;t effectual means of making them a comfort to your&s;elves and worthy members of &s;ociety; and, beyond all doubt, will be a more certain method of &s;ucce&s;s and happine&s;s to them, than if you had it in your power to be&s;tow on them fortunes, &s;uppo&s;ing you have left them de&s;titute of tho&s;e other mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential qualifications. The day which God intended &s;hould be more particularly devo|ted to &s;uch purpo&s;es, is the &s;abbath day, emphatically called, by the Apo&s;tle, the Lord's day. Some part of which, at lea&s;t, ought not only to be employed in a regular attendance on public wor&s;hip, but al&s;o in the in&s;truction of your families at home, according to your re&s;pective abilities and opportunities. This is a duty, one would imagine, that required no great per&s;ua&s;ion to put in practice. Our children are, in a manner, our&s;elves.
<PB N="15" REF="020020050000180">
The attainment al&s;o of knowledge is mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the mind. To impart, therefore, <NOTE PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t give great plea&s;ure to every humane chri&s;tian, to find a charity-|&s;chool &s;et on foot in the pari&s;h of CHART, for the in&s;truction of poor children in reading, which is the key of all knowledge, and the practice of &s;uch manual arts as may be &s;ub&s;ervient to their future &s;upport in life. This has hitherto been maintained by the application of a &s;mall portion of the poor's ce&s;s and by private contributions; but particularly by the generous patro|nage and &s;upport of a lady [Mrs. B&mdash;e] who&s;e hand and heart are ever open and ready to every good work.</NOTE> religious know|ledge to tho&s;e who are &s;o peculiarly our own, and the want of which mu&s;t cau&s;e the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, mu&s;t needs afford us mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible &s;atisfaction; and we &s;hall receive &s;till greater plea&s;ure from this labour of love, when we recollect, that by thus employing the&s;e &s;acred &s;ea&s;ons of re&s;t from our worldly engagements, we are obeying the expre&s;s commands of God by his Prophet I&s;aiah, who has promi&s;ed, on the performance of the&s;e religious offices on his holy day, &s;ucce&s;s to our hone&s;t undertakings and pro&s;perity to our country; "if thou turn away thy foot from the &s;abbath, from doing thy

plea&s;ure on my holy day and call the &s;abbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and &s;halt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own plea|&s;ure, nor &s;peaking thine own words: then &s;halt thou delight thy&s;elf in the the Lord; and I will cau&s;e thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father, for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it." I&s;aiah lviii. 13. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus have I, my brethren, with great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, but with the greate&s;t &s;incerity and affection, endeavoured to impre&s;s you with truths of the greate&s;t importance to your pre&s;ent and future welfare; which, if &s;uffered to have the de&s;ired effects on your minds, will "make you wi&s;e unto &s;alvation;" will render, du|ring your journey through a trouble &s;ome world, the unavoidable &s;trokes of adver&s;ity, whenever they befal you, more tolerable, and the &s;miles of pro&s;perity le&s;s dangerous; will be a means of bringing down the

ble&s;&s;ings of divine providence on your&s;elves and fami|lies; and will unavoidably, as far as your influence can be &s;uppo&s;ed to operate, contribute your &s;mall &s;hare to the welfare of your country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude my di&s;cour&s;e with the admirable ex|hortation of St. Paul to the Philippians. "Finally brethren, what&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what|&s;oever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any prai&s;e, think" meditate "on" and practi&s;e "the&s;e things." <HI>Phil.</HI> iv. 8.</P>
