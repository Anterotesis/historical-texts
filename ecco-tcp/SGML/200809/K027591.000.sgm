<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the reasons which have occasioned the necessity of the present plan, are shortly stated, the friends of Mr. MACKLIN are willing to persuade themselves, that proposals for a Subscription will not be unwelcome to the Public. Dr. JOHNSON observed, on a similar occasion, that,
<Q>"To assist industrious indigence, struggling with distress, and debilitated by age, is a display of virtue, and an acquisition of happiness and honour."</Q></P>
<P>THE present address is an appeal to the humanity and generosity of a large and opulent community, in behalf of a Man, who has lived to the age of NINETY TWO, and of that long life has passed near SEVENTY YEARS, under the eye of the public, at all times diligent in his business, and now a worn-out Veteran in the service of the Drama.</P>
<P>BLESSED with uncommon vigour of constitution, Mr. MACKLIN hoped that his industry and indefatigable pains would have held him above want to the end of his life. But the decay of his memory has deprived him of all hopes of appearing again in that profession, which he always loved, and before that public, whom he honoured, for the generous encouragement, with which his exertions have been always distinguished.</P>
<P>IT is now near three years since he first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the middle of his part, on Covent Garden Stage, a sudden failure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. He has lived from that time in hopes of recovering his faculties; but his hopes have been too san|guine, and he now feels with regret, that he can never again have the ho|nour of presenting himself before a British Audience.</P>
<P>IT is for this reason, that his friends presume to make this application. The two pieces, on which the applause of numerous audiences has stamped a value, were never printed, and as Mr. MACKLIN's memory has so far de|serted him, as to render those productions of no further use to him, it has been agreed, at a meeting of his friends, to offer them to the public by Sub|scription.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">THE EDITOR has most cheerfully undertaken the office of superintending the press, for a disabled Performer, whom he has known during a number of years, and whom he always respected for his professional talents. He would take the liberty to add more, were he not restrained by Mr. MACKLIN, who says,
<Q>"That he has not lived an inattentive observer of the public mind, and therefore desires that his case, without further solicitation, may be left to the generosity of such, as are willing to relieve the languor of age, and the pains of disease, and indigence."</Q></P>
<P>N. B. Dr. BROCKLESBY, JOHN PALMER, Esq. of the <HI>Post Office,</HI> and THOMAS LONGMAN, Esq. of Paternoster-Row, have undertaken, as TRUSTEES, to receive the amount of the Subscription, and to vest the same in such manner, as will carry into execution the intention of the Subscribers, for Mr. MACKLIN's Benefit.</P>
