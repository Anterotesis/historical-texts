<HEAD>THE HIGHWAYMAN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was in the merry month of May, when the whole animal creation, from the minute&s;t in&s;ect the micro&s;cope di&s;covers upon the leaf, to the large&s;t bea&s;t which grazes in the field, or preys in the fore&s;t; when the fowls of the air, from the diminutive hum|ming bird to the eagle of the &s;un; when the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea, from the little &s;prat to the un|wieldy leviathan, pay implicit obedience to that divine ordinance of heaven, <HI>increa&s;e and multi|ply.</HI> I &s;ay, it was in the month of May, &s;o ju&s;tly &s;tiled "the mother of love," when na|ture wears an univer&s;al &s;mile, when every plant and tree &s;prouts forth in bud and blo&s;&s;om, and the whole earth is cloathed in variegated green: being fa&s;t a&s;leep in a &s;tage-coach on the road to Wind&s;or, and my imagination having taken an excur&s;ion in a dream to vi&s;it,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
to conver&s;e with, and to embrace, &s;ome dear friends in Ireland, I was di&s;turbed from my &s;weet vi&s;ion about five miles from London, by a tremendous voice, from the &s;ide of the road, which with reiterated vociferation, roar|ed out, Stop! &s;top!</P>
<P>My hands in&s;tinctively &s;lipped into my breeches pocket, and with a motion equally involuntary, drew forth a &s;mall pur&s;e, con|taining the &s;mall &s;um of one guinea and a few &s;hillings, to give the highwayman. The coachman at the &s;ame in&s;tant drew up his hor&s;es.</P>
<P>If any hero wi&s;hes to be informed why I did not rather apply to my pi&s;tols&mdash;I had none with me, or if I had, I &s;hould not have applied to them.</P>
<P>Indeed, in&s;tead of charging my pi&s;tols, which I left hanging up in my chambers, where may they long hang for ornaments, I had prepared the &s;mall &s;um I have before men|tioned, and put it into the little pur&s;e afore|&s;aid, in ca&s;e of being &s;topped; for it has long been my opinion, that if a man con&s;iders his

own intere&s;t, in which undoubtedly his <HI>peace of mind</HI> has an intimate and large &s;hare&mdash;to part with what he can &s;pare from his ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ities, will appear preferable to ri&s;quing ri&s;e for a trifle. It requires no great portion of humanity to conclude, that to deprive a fellow-creature of life, and di&s;patch his &s;oul in the very act of &s;in, to
<Q>that country from who&s;e bourne no traveller re|turns,</Q>
though compatible with earthly <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> mu&s;t be offen&s;ive to eternal <HI>mercy.</HI> If this a&s;&s;ertion be erroneous, how comes it that the act of &s;acrificing a wretch's life in de|fence of a paltry &s;um, always impre&s;&s;es upon the mind of the avenger, a horror which amounts to puni&s;hment?</P>
<P>As the coach-door opened I put out my hand&mdash;here, my hone&s;t friend, &s;aid I, ad|dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the highwayman, here, take my money.</P>
<P>I received a &s;hot in return for my cour|te&s;y&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;ay a &s;hot&mdash;but not a &s;hot from a pi&s;tol, nor a &s;hot from a blunderbu&s;s&mdash;it was a chain-&s;hot,
<PB N="6" REF="9">
or a double-headed &s;hot, which you plea&s;e, di&s;charged from a pair of as bright eyes as ever wounded the heart of an unwary traveller.</P>
<P>The lady mi&s;taking the offer of my hand, which intended to convey my pur&s;e to the &s;uppo&s;ed highwayman, for an offer to a&s;&s;i&s;t her into the carriage, &s;eized it with the mo&s;t good humoured familiarity, and fixing her right foot firm upon the coach-&s;tep, rai&s;ed her body up with a &s;pring of agility, which clear|ly proved, ela&s;ticity was not the lea&s;t property in her compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he &s;tood in equilibrium, nodding and &s;miling a farewel over her left &s;houlder, to a male friend, the per&s;on who had ordered the coach to &s;top: and taking her &s;eat exactly oppo&s;ite to me, &s;he waved her hand out of the coach window, to her parting companion &mdash;the coachman, with a <HI>hoi, hoi,</HI> and a crack of his whip, informed his hor&s;es of their duty, the hor&s;es obeyed, and we drove on.</P>

<P>THE road was &s;mooth&mdash;the coach rolled on&mdash;the lady &s;lept&mdash;but as &s;he &s;lept, &s;he &s;lipt.&mdash;</P>
<P>The cu&s;hion on which &s;he &s;at gently gave way&mdash;perceiving her in danger of falling, and anxious to prevent it, I placed my feet clo&s;e to her's.&mdash;This precaution immediately tran&s;|ferred the point of gravity from the feet to the knee, and the coach continuing to com|municate its motion to the lady, no &s;ooner were her feet &s;topped, than her knees natu|rally bent forward.&mdash;</P>
<P>Determined to &s;upport her, I gently &s;lipt forward till our knees met.&mdash;</P>
<P>For above a mile we rolled along the road foot to foot, knee to knee&mdash;the coach conti|nuing to communicate motion to the lady, the lady communicating motion to me&mdash;till,
<PB N="29" REF="32">
unfortunately, the road growing rough, the motion increa&s;ed, and became irregular&mdash;I lo&s;t my &s;ituation&mdash;the lady lo&s;t her &s;ituation of con&s;equence.</P>

<P>I did all in my power to &s;upport her, but in vain&mdash;though the lady did every thing &s;he could to &s;upport her&s;elf, and my <HI>Lord Coke</HI> lent his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;</P>

<P>Thank Heaven! there is a complacency in my di&s;po&s;ition, which bids defiance to trifling ca&s;ualties; and whether the road be <HI>rough,</HI> or whether the road be <HI>&s;mooth,</HI> my temper is &s;till the &s;ame, and I never quarrel with the road, nor with my&s;elf, nor with any thing I meet, but go whi&s;tling on&mdash;I only wi&s;h I may never meet the&s;e rough &s;pots on Mount Aetna, on Mount Ve&s;uvius, or on any other <HI>burn|ing</HI> mount.&mdash;I care not how <HI>warm</HI> the climate is&mdash;but Heaven pre&s;erve me from <HI>volcanos!</HI> &mdash;I have an implacable aver&s;ion to <HI>fire!</HI>&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>THE CRITIQUE.</HEAD>
<P><Q>If STERNE was ever <HI>rivalled</HI> in the de&s;criptive, the narrative, in language, or in the &s;entimental, it is by <HI>Mr. M'Dermott,</HI> in his new publication of the FEMALE MONITOR; the hi&s;tory of <HI>Ara|bella</HI> is one of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly drawings of the <HI>human pen.&mdash;Locke, Hume,</HI> and many other ce|lebrated authors have favoured us with e&s;&s;ays on education, but <HI>in</HI> Arabella <HI>they live,</HI> and theory rendered practicable by &s;weet and ea&s;y admonition; the &s;trictures of the Female Monitor, with the author's own digre&s;&s;ions, are admirably interwoven in the piece, and <HI>forms</HI> a mo&s;t in&s;tructive and agree|able dialogue: the letters from Mr. Worthy to his &s;on Charles, at Oxford, are <HI>&s;terling,</HI> and <HI>abounds</HI> with honourable precepts and information; the de&s;cription of the old half-pay officer, given by Charles, is one of tho&s;e mo&s;t affecting, a <HI>&s;enti|mental &s;ituation</HI> that demands the <HI>tear of admi|ration,</HI> and plucks the <HI>laurel</HI> from the <HI>Monk of Calis.</HI>&mdash;Lady Gay's <HI>career</HI> through life is <HI>dramati|cally conceived,</HI> and gives <HI>precept</HI> a <HI>ri&s;ible</HI> ca&s;t judiciou&s;ly introduced to clo&s;e the &s;cene.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>name</HI> of the author of the FEMALE MONI|TOR, as well as the <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> which marks this <HI>critique,</HI> clearly points out the country which had the honour of giving him birth, a circum&s;tance which in <HI>my</HI> opinion, mu&s;t recommend him to all <HI>mammas,</HI> all <HI>mams</HI> of boarding &s;chools, and <HI>private governe&s;&s;es</HI> of young ladies, particularly as the <HI>critique</HI> declares the work to be the mo&s;t ma&s;terly drawing of the <HI>human pen</HI>; which &s;hews that the work, like many other works, does not carry the <HI>traits</HI> of the <HI>goo&s;e-quill:</HI> indeed it goes a great way to prove, the certainty of an old opinion, that <HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> have <HI>wings,</HI> and out of &s;ome of their pinions perhaps, Mr. M'Dermott's <HI>human pen</HI> was plucked. But I find it impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>conceive</HI> (though I have called in my hu&s;band's aid to my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance) the following a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;"<HI>Locke, Hume,</HI> and <HI>many other</HI> celebrated authors have favoured us with e&s;&s;ays on education, but <HI>in</HI> ARABELLA <HI>they</HI> live;" now as <HI>Locke</HI> and <HI>Hume</HI> are indubitably <HI>dead,</HI> and we have not heard of their <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> how comes it that <HI>they</HI> live in <HI>Arabella</HI>; indeed were they <HI>alive,</HI> it is out of nature to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould <HI>live</HI> &s;o long <HI>in Arabella</HI>; for though <HI>Jonas</HI> lived a con&s;i|derable time in the <HI>whale's belly,</HI> his life was pre|&s;erved by miracle, and he was but <HI>one</HI> per&s;on; whereas it appears, that <HI>Arabella</HI> is <HI>en&s;ient,</HI> that is, big with <HI>Locke, Hume,</HI> and &s;everal <HI>other</HI> authors. It is true, a certain dutche&s;s of <HI>Heidleberg</HI> had three hundred and &s;ixty-five <HI>children</HI> at a birth; and the font in which they were chri&s;tened, is &s;till &s;hewn in the great church of the town; but then the&s;e were children, not men. But perhaps the critique upon Mr. M'Der|mott's work does not mean that the <HI>philo&s;ophers</HI> and authors are <HI>in</HI> poor <HI>Arabella</HI> in a &s;tate of <HI>tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> but only in <HI>Spirit,</HI> which the author of the <HI>Female Monitor</HI> might believe, if he admits the doctrine of <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is,</HI> or tran&s;migration of <HI>&s;ouls</HI>; for though a woman could not rightly enter|tain &s;o many <HI>men</HI> in <HI>ventra &s;emere,</HI> corporally, yet &s;he might entertain them <HI>&s;piritually,</HI> as may be proved from the number of <HI>devils,</HI> &s;ometimes a whole <HI>legion</HI> together, which have <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> per&s;ons in former times.&mdash;CATHARINE MAC. GRA&mdash;M.</P>
<P>The FEMALE MONITOR certainly demands the <HI>tear</HI> of <HI>admiration,</HI> whenever admiration <HI>weeps</HI>; but I cannot think there was much &s;entiment in the author's plucking the <HI>laurel</HI> from the <HI>Monk of Calais,</HI> by which I &s;uppo&s;e he mu&s;t mean "<HI>the few &s;cattered white hairs upon his temples.</HI>"&mdash;</P>

<P>Having touched a little upon <HI>imitation</HI> and literary thieving, I will now &s;tate a few un|arranged thoughts on <HI>&s;imilarity</HI> of thinking.&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>variety</HI> we &s;ee in the per&s;ons, in the faces, and in the modes of thinking, which di&s;tingui&s;h the individuals who compo&s;e the human animal, are a&s;toni&s;hing! But <HI>variety</HI> and <HI>contra&s;t</HI> in the appearance and manners of man, are nece&s;&s;ary to the purpo&s;es of his be|ing, and &s;hew the infinite wi&s;dom and infinite power of his Creator.</P>
<P>From variety and contra&s;t of per&s;on we judge of proportion, and the elegance of &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">From variety and contra&s;t of face, we judge of beauty and of ornament.</P>
<P>And from variety and contra&s;t of thinking, we judge of intellectual capacity, as it ope|rates in the progre&s;s of its &s;tudy upon &s;ciences, and its invention and improvement in the arts.</P>
<P>So that it may be &s;aid, that the knowledge of all arts, and the knowledge of all &s;ciences, which include the knowledge of all things, is the con&s;equence of variety in our modes of thinking, and contra&s;t in our opinions; which variety and contra&s;t, &s;timulate us to controver&s;y and experiment. And as <HI>virtue</HI> would not have been known but for the con|tra&s;t of <HI>vice,</HI> nor <HI>colours</HI> but for the <HI>variety</HI> of their <HI>&s;hades,</HI> neither would arts nor &s;ciences have been known, had the organs of mankind been &s;o formed that <HI>every</HI> individual &s;hould think alike.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the ver&s;atile &s;portings of nature in forming her creatures, we often find a &s;trong &s;imilitude of per&s;on, a &s;trong &s;imilitude of face, and a &s;trong &s;imilitude in

<P>The complexion of the Queen of Portugal was a bright olive&mdash;Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> never con&s;idered colours&mdash;he admired the whole &s;ex &mdash;every colour had its attraction for him&mdash; he loved <HI>woman,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he was <HI>woman</HI>; and to this generous affection he bore to <HI>woman</HI> kind, may be imputed a pa&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t ge|nerous and di&s;intere&s;ted, which from his youth he had entertained for an individual.</P>
<P>The Count made his obei&s;ance&mdash;the Queen opened her eyes&mdash;the Count dropped the cur|tains of his eyes&mdash;a dead &s;ilence en&s;ued&mdash;</P>

<P>Your prudence, Sir, &s;aid the Queen, in not communicating your bu&s;ine&s;s to any of my mini&s;ters, proves you worthy of your em|ployment &mdash;the bu&s;ine&s;s of politicks &s;hould never be carried on through a <HI>medium</HI>&mdash;</P>
