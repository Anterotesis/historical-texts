<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following poem is founded on a very &s;ingular Event that happened near Lyons in the month of June 1770&mdash;Two Lovers (FALDONI and TERESA MEUNIER) meeting with an invincible ob&s;tacle to their union, determined to put an end to their exi&s;tence with pi&s;tols. The place they cho&s;e for the execution of their terrible project was a chapel that &s;tood at a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e. They even decorated the altar for the occa&s;ion: they al&s;o paid a particular attention to their own dre&s;s: TERESA was dre&s;&s;ed in white, with ro&s;e-coloured Ribbands: The &s;ame coloured Ribbands were tied to the pi&s;tols. Each held the Ribband that was fa&s;tened to the other's trigger, which they drew at a &s;ignal agreed upon.</P>
<Q>Arria and Paetus (&s;ays Mon&s;ieur de Voltaire) &s;et the example, but then it mu&s;t be con&s;idered they were condemned to death by a tyrant, whereas love was the only inventor and perpetrator of the deed we have recorded&mdash;See <HI>Que&s;tions &s;ur L'Encyclopedie, Articles De caton et de &s;uicide</HI>&mdash;See al&s;o a book entitled <HI>Les Tableaux</HI> by the Marquis de Pezai.</Q>
