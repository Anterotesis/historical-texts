<P>GOOD precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity. And here I pre&s;ent my good reader with one, delivered by the fir&s;t founder of mythology, Ae&s;op him&s;elf. Maximus Planudes takes notice of it, as a very excellent part of his production; and Phae|drus, Camerarius, and others, &s;eem to agree, that his Eagle, and five others not yet tran&s;lated, are equal to

any of his that are handed down to us. Though Mr. Ogleby and Sir Roger L'E&s;trange had the unhappine&s;s to be unacquainted with them, yet I had the good for|tune to di&s;cover them by the removal of my old library, which has made me amends for the trouble of getting to where I now teach. They were written, or dictated at lea&s;t, by Ae&s;op, in the fifty-fourth Olympiad: and though I de&s;igned them chiefly for the u&s;e of my &s;chool (this being tran&s;lated by a youth de&s;igned for a Greek profe&s;&s;or), yet no man is &s;o wi&s;e as not to need in&s;truc|tion, aye, and by the way of fable too; &s;ince the Holy Scriptures them&s;elves, the be&s;t in&s;tructors, teach us by way of parable, &s;ymbol, image, and figure; and David was more moved with Nathan's "Thou art the man," than all the mo&s;t rigid lectures in the world would have done. Whoever will be at the trouble of comparing this ver&s;ion with the original, let them begin at the tenth line, and they will find it metaphra&s;tically done, <HI>verbum verbo,</HI> as the be&s;t way of ju&s;tice to the author. Tho&s;e that are meer adorers of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> will not be angry that it is in this &s;ort of metre, for which I gave leave, the lad having a turn to this &s;ort of mea&s;ure, which is plea&s;ant and agreeable, though not lofty.

<HEAD>THE EAGLE AND THE ROBIN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. KING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To the works of this excellent Humouri&s;t, which were fir&s;t collected in 1776, I prefixed &s;ome Memoirs of his Life; which have &s;ince been &s;o elegantly epitomized, that it would be &s;uperfluous to enlarge on this article. Some extracts from his la&s;t biographer &s;hall therefore &s;upply the place: <Q REND="inline">"William King was born in London in 1663, the &s;on of Ezekiel King, a gentleman. He was allied to the family of Clarendon. From We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool, where he was a &s;cholar on the foundation under the care of Dr. Bu&s;by, he was at eighteen elected to Chri&s;t-church, in 1681. In 1688, he was made ma&s;ter of arts; and, engaging in the &s;tudy of the Civil Law, became doctor in 1692, and was admitted advocate at Doc|tors Commons.&mdash;Though he was a regular advocate in the courts of civil and canon law, he did not love his profe&s;&s;ion, nor indeed any kind of bu&s;ine&s;s which interrupted his volup|tuary dreams, or forced him to rou&s;e from that indulgence in which only he could find delight. His reputation as a civi|lian was yet maintained by his judgements in the courts of Delegates, and rai&s;ed very high by the addre&s;s and know|ledge which he di&s;covered in 1700, when he defended the earl of Angle&s;ea again&s;t his lady, afterwards dutche&s;s of Buckingham&s;hire, who &s;ued for a divorce, and obtained it. The expence of his plea&s;ures, and neglect of bu&s;ine&s;s, had now le&s;&s;ened his revenues; and he was willing to accept of a &s;ettlement in Ireland, where, about 1702, he was made judge of the admiralty, commi&s;&s;ioner of the prizes, keeper of the records in Birmingham's tower, and vicar-general to Dr. Mar&s;h the primate. But it is vain to put wealth within the reach of him who will not &s;tretch out his hand to take it. King &s;oon found a friend, as idle and thoughtle&s;s as him&s;elf, in Upton, one of the judges, who had a plea&s;ant hou&s;e called Mountown, near Dublin, to which King frequently retired; delighting to neglect his intere&s;t, forget his cares, and de&s;ert his duty. Here he wrote "Mully of Mountown," a poem, by which, though fanciful readers in the pride of &s;agacity have given it a political interpretation, was meant originally no more than it expre&s;&s;ed, as it was dictated only by the au|thor's delight in the quiet of Mountown. In 1708, when lord Wharton was &s;ent to govern Ireland, King returned to London, with his poverty, his idlene&s;s, and his wit. In 1711, competence, if not plenty, was again put into his power. He was, without the trouble of attendance, or the mortification of a reque&s;t, made gazetteer. He was now again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">laced in a profitable employment, and again threw the be|nefit away. An Act of In&s;olvency made his bu&s;ine&s;s at that time particularly trouble&s;ome; and he would not wait till hurry &s;hould be at an end, but impatiently re&s;igned it, and returned to his wonted indigence and amu&s;ements. One of his amu&s;ements at Lambeth, where he re&s;ided, was to mor|tify Dr. Tenni&s;on, the archbi&s;hop, by a publick fe&s;tivity, on the &s;urrender of Dunkirk to Hill; an event with which Ten|ni&s;on's political bigotry did not &s;uffer him to be delighted. King was re&s;olved to counteract his &s;ullenne&s;s, and at the ex|pence of a few barrels of ale filled the neighbourhood with hone&s;t merriment. In the autumn of 1712 his health de|clined; he grew weaker by degrees, and died on Chri&s;tmas-day. Though his life had not been without irregularity, his principles were pure and orthodox, and his death was pious. After this relation, it will be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that his poems were rather the amu&s;ements of idlene&s;s than efforts of &s;tudy; that he endeavoured rather to divert than a&s;toni&s;h; that his thoughts &s;eldom a&s;pired to &s;ublimity; and that, if his ver&s;e was ea&s;y and his images familiar, he attained what he de&s;ired. His purpo&s;e is to be merry; though perhaps, to enjoy his mirth, it may be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to think well of his opinions."</Q> I need not repeat that this is quoted from Dr. John&s;on.</P>

<L><PB N="5" REF="8">To cheer the poor, the &s;ick, and cold,</L>

<L>" Oh! bring him in, and keep him warm;</L>
<L>Robins do never any harm."</L>
<L>They &s;oon obey'd, and chopt him meat,</L>
<L>Gave him whatever he would eat;</L>
<L>The Lady care her&s;elf did take,</L>
<L>And made a ne&s;t for Robin's &s;ake:</L>
<L>But he perkt up into her chair,</L>
<L>In which he plenteou&s;ly did fare,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;uming quite another air.</L>
<L>The neighbours thought, when this they &s;py'd,</L>
<L>The world well mended on his &s;ide.</L>
</LG>

<L>With well-tun'd throat he whi&s;tled long,</L>

<L>We 'll clo&s;et him among the re&s;t</L>
<L>Of tho&s;e my Lady loves the be&s;t."</L>
<L>They little thought, that &s;aw him come,</L>
<L>That Robins were &s;o quarrel&s;ome:</L>
<L>The door they open'd, in he pops,</L>
<L>And to the highe&s;t perch he hops;</L>
<L>The party-colour'd birds he cho&s;e,</L>
<L>The Gold-finches, and &s;uch as tho&s;e;</L>
<L>With them he'd peck, and bill, and feed,</L>
<L>And very well (at times) agreed:</L>
<L>Canary-birds were his delight,</L>
<L>With them he'd <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> all night;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10">But the brown Linnets went to pot,</L>
<L>He kill'd them all upon the &s;pot.</L>

<L>That brought him to my Lady fir&s;t.</L>
<L>At la&s;t they all re&s;olv'd upon 't,</L>
<L>Some way to tell my Lady on 't.</L>

<L>Meanwhile he 'd had a noble &s;wing,</L>
<L>And rul'd ju&s;t like the Gallic king;</L>
<L>Having kill'd or wounded all,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s the Eagle in the hall;</L>
<L>With whom he dur&s;t but only jar,</L>
<L>He being the very &s;oul of war,</L>
<L>But hated him for his de&s;ert,</L>
<L>And bore him malice at his heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Eagle was my Lady's pride,</L>
<L>The guardian &s;afety of her &s;ide:</L>
<L>He often brought home foreign prey,</L>
<L>Which humbly at her feet he lay.</L>
<L>For colour, pinions, and &s;tature,</L>
<L>The faire&s;t workman&s;hip of nature;</L>
<L>'Twould do one good to &s;ee him move,</L>
<L>So full of grandeur, grace, and love:</L>
<L>He was indeed a bird for Jove.</L>
<L>He &s;oar'd aloft in Brucum's field,</L>
<L>And thou&s;and Kites and Vultures kill'd;</L>
<L>Which made him dear to all that flew,</L>

How oft has a &s;tubborn folly been &s;ucce&s;sfully arraigned by a candid and ea&s;y rebuke, which had long maintained it&s;elf again&s;t a more powerful, though a le&s;s familiar, conviction! If we can &s;mile away the follies of an adver&s;ary, &s;port with his vanities, and laugh him into a &s;en&s;e of his errors; why &s;hould we forfeit that exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure of complacency and good-humour, which a malicious conflict with a rival would mo&s;t certainly deprive us of? If we mi&s;carry in an attempt of this nature, our defeat would be the le&s;s di&s;honourable, becau&s;e we &s;eemed only to play and trifle with the mi&s;takes of an author; but &s;hould we, under the ma&s;k of a little raillery, wit, and good-humour, obtain our end, it would double our &s;atisfaction, as well as the glory of our conque&s;t. Two important debates of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in religion (Eachard's Contempt of the Clergy, and Philautus and Timothy) have with won|derful applau&s;e lately appeared in the world; the beauties of their author's &s;tile, the purity of their diction, the elegant turn of thought, and above all a torrent of &s;evere but good-natured wit, drew a thou&s;and readers to peru&s;e an hypothe&s;is they little imagined ever to e&s;pou&s;e; but they were in&s;en&s;ibly deluded into good principles, and betrayed into a conviction of tho&s;e very truths they came on purpo&s;e to deride and ridicule. Where they expected to gratify a fancy only, they found a more real advantage in the reformation of their judgement, and, from admirers of the author's wit and beauties, became at la&s;t pro&s;elytes to their opinions. If in two or three in&s;tances I have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my own rules, the Fool or the Knave mu&s;t be imagined very notorious; and that tho&s;e tender and merciful la&s;hes that were judged &s;ufficient for little offenders would hardly have reached the vanities of the one, or the villainies of the other. And if I am thought to have injured any per&s;on in his character, or to have &s;aid as much as I am able, I mu&s;t beg leave to a&s;&s;ure the world, that it was owing to abundance of humanity and good-nature I did not &s;ay a great deal more; and would rather advi&s;e them to &s;it ea&s;y and quiet under the innocent rebukes of a &s;atire, than provoke others to prepare that correction, which their ignorance, their impudence, or both, have &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erved.

This puts me in mind of the fore&s;ight of a gentleman, who had been &s;ome time envoy from the king to the princes and &s;tates of Italy, and who, in his return home, made the coa&s;t of France his road; in order to be as u&s;eful to his country as po&s;&s;ible, and to his &s;overeign too, as he thought. In his audience of the king, he told his maje&s;ty, that the French were hard at work, building men of war in &s;everal of their ports, and that &s;uch a ha&s;ty increa&s;e of the naval power of France could not but threaten England's &s;o|vereignty of the &s;eas, and con&s;equently portend de&s;truction to her trade. The gentleman was in the right, for our trade and the &s;overeignty of the &s;eas are dependent on each other; they mu&s;t live or die together. But what a recompen&s;e do you think he met with for his fidelity? really &s;uch a one as I would hardly have believed, had I been told it by any per&s;on but his own &s;on, the late Mr. Bevil Higgons, who&s;e works, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, have made him known to all the men of letters in Britain, and who&s;e attachment to the fa|mily of Stuart, even to his dying day, puts his veracity in this point out of di&s;pute. The recompence was a &s;evere re|primand from the king, as the fore-runner to the laying him a&s;ide, for talking of things which his maje&s;ty told him it was not his bu&s;ine&s;s to meddle with."</Q> I forget from which of the political writers between 1730 and 1740 this anecdote was tran&s;cribed; mo&s;t probably The Craft&s;man.

<HEAD>THE APPARITION, BY ABEL EVANS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Abel Evans, the author of this and the following poems, though a man of genius, the friend of the fir&s;t poets of the times, and applauded by them, is now hardly known. He is generally &s;tyled Dr. Evans the Epigrammi&s;t, and was one of the Oxford wits enumerated in the following di&s;tich (wretchedly imitated in the "Additions to Pope," vol. I. p. 163.):
<Q><L>" Alma novem genuit celebres Rhedycina poetas;</L>
<L>" Bub, Stubb, Cobb, Crabb, Trapp, Young, Carey, Tickell, Evans."</L></Q>
He is likewi&s;e mentioned in the Dunciad, B. II. ver. 116. in company with Dr. Young and Dean Swift, as one of the authors who&s;e works had been claimed by James More Smith. Dr. Evans was of St. John the Bapti&s;t's College, Oxford; and took the degree of M.A. March 23, 1699; that of B.D. April 26, 1705; and D.D. May 16, 1711. He was bur&s;ar to his college; vicar of St. Gyles's, Oxford; and appears to have been intimate with Mr. Pope, to whom there are two letters by him in print, in one of which the initial letter W. (intended for his Chri&s;tian name) is by mi&s;take put in&s;tead of that by which he u&s;ed to &s;ign him&s;elf. R.</NOTE>, D.D.

<HEAD>ON THE MONUMENT AT LONDON.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY CAPTAIN RADCLIFFE<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>This writer has already appeared in vol. I. p. 145. I did not then know that he had publi&s;hed a collection of his poems, under the title of
"The Ramble, an Anti-heroick Poem, together with &s;ome Terre&s;trial Hymns and Carnal Ejaculations, by Alexander Radcliffe, of Grays Inn, E&s;q. 1682,"
8vo; in&s;cribed to James Lord Anne&s;ley. He had publi&s;hed in 1680
"Ovid Trave&s;tie, a Burle&s;que upon Ovid's Epi&s;tles;"
with a &s;atirical introduction occa&s;ioned by the "Preface to a late-Book, called The Wits paraphra&s;ed." Mr. Ton&s;on printed a third edition of this Trave&s;tie in 1696. The Dedication "To Robert Fairbeard, of Grays Inn, E&s;q." is no bad &s;pecimen of the author's humour. <Q REND="inline">"Having com|mitted the&s;e Epi&s;tles to the Pre&s;s, I was horribly put to it for a Patron. I thought of &s;ome great Lord, or &s;ome angelic Lady; but then again con&s;idered I &s;hould never be able to adorn my Dedication with benign beams, corru&s;cant rays, and the Devil and all of influence. At la&s;t I heard my good friend Mr. Fairbeard was come to town&mdash;nay then&mdash;all's well enough. To you therefore I offer this Engli&s;h Ovid, to whom you may not be unaptly compared in &s;everal parcels of your life and conver&s;ation, only with this exception, that you have nothing of his Tri&s;tibus. 'Tis you who burle&s;que all the fop|pery and conceited gravity of the age. I remember you once told a grave and affected Advocate, 'that he burle&s;qued God's image, for God had made him after his own likene&s;s, but he made him&s;elf look like an a&s;s.' Upon the whole matter I am very well &s;atisfied in my choice of you for a judge; if you &s;peak well of the book, 'tis all I de&s;ire, and the book&s;eller will have rea&s;on to rejoice: though by your approbation you may draw upon your&s;elf a grand inconvenience; for perhaps you may too often have &s;ongs, &s;onnets, madrigals, and an innumerable army of &s;tanzas obtruded upon you by, Sir, Your humble &s;ervant, ALEX. RADCLIFFE."</Q></P>

<P>Among&s;t his other poems, is a facetious one
"On the Me|mory of Mr. John Sprat, late Steward of Grays Inn;"
another,
"On the Death of Edward Story, E&s;q. Ma&s;ter of the Pond, and Principal of Bernard's Inn;"

"The Sword's Farewell upon the Approach of Michaelmas-term."

<HEAD>PART OF VIRGIL'S FIRST GEORGICK,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>TRANSLATED BY HENRY SACHEVERELL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hi&s;tory of this man affords a very &s;triking example of the folly and madne&s;s of party, which could exalt an ob|&s;cure individual, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but moderate talents, to an height of popularity that the pre&s;ent times behold with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment. He was the &s;on of Jo&s;hua Sa|cheverell of Marlborough clerk (who died mini&s;ter of St. Peter's Church in Marlborough, leaving a numerous family in very low circum&s;tances). Henry was put to &s;chool at Marlborough, at the charge of Mr. Edward Hear&s;t, an apo|thecary, who, being his godfather, adopted him as his &s;on, Hear&s;t's widow put him afterwards to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became demy in 1687, at the age of 15. Young Sacheverell &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by a regular ob|&s;ervation of the duties of the hou&s;e, by his compo&s;itions, good-manners, and genteel behaviour; qualifications which recommended him to that &s;ociety, of which he was fellow, and, as public tutor, had the care of the education of mo&s;t of the young gentlemen of quality and fortune that were ad|mitted of the college. In this &s;tation he bred a great many per&s;ons eminent for their learning and abilities; and among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> others was tutor to Mr. Hold&s;worth, who&s;e "Mu&s;cipula" and "Di&s;&s;ertations on Virgil" have been &s;o de&s;ervedly e&s;teem|ed. He was contemporaty and chamber-fellow with Mr. Addi&s;on, and one of his chief intimates till the time of his famous trial. Mr. Addi&s;on's
"Account of the greate&s;t Engli&s;h Poets,"
dated April 3, 1694, in a Farewell-poem to the Mu&s;es on his intending to enter into holy orders, was in&s;cribed "to Mr. Henry Sacheverell," his <HI>then</HI> deare&s;t friend and colleague. Much has been &s;aid by Sacheverell's enemies of his ingratitude to his relations, and of his turbulent beha|viour at Oxford; but the&s;e appear to have been groundle&s;s ca|lumnies, circulated only by the &s;pirit of party. In his younger years he wrote &s;ome excellent Latin poems: be&s;ides &s;everal in the &s;econd and third volumes of the "Mu&s;ae Anglicanae," a&s;cribed to his pupils, there is a good one of &s;ome length in the &s;econd volume, under his own name (tran&s;cribed from the Oxford Collection, on Q. Mary's death, 1695). He took the degree of M.A. May 16, 1696; B.D, Feb. 4, 1707; D.D. July 1, 1708. His fir&s;t preferment was Cannock, in the county of Stafford. He was appointed preacher of St. Saviour's, Southwark, in 1705; and while in this &s;tation preached his famous &s;ermons (at Derby, Aug. 15, 1709; and at St. Paul's, Nov. 5, in the &s;ame year); and in one of them was &s;uppo&s;ed to point at lord Godolphin. under the name of <HI>Volpone.</HI> It has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that to this circum&s;tance, as much as to the doctrines contained in his &s;ermons, he was indebted for his pro&s;ecution, and eventually for his prefer|ment. Being impeached by the hou&s;e of commons, his trial began Feb. 27, 1709-10; and continued until the 23d of March: when he was &s;entenced to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from preach|ing for three years, and his two &s;ermons ordered to be burnt. This ridiculous pro&s;ecution overthrew the mini&s;try, and laid the foundation of his fortune. To Sir Simon Harcourt, who was coun&s;el for him, he pre&s;ented a &s;ilver ba&s;on gilt, with an ele|gant in&s;cription. He very &s;oon after was collated to a living near Shrew&s;bury; and, in the &s;ame month that his &s;u&s;pen&s;ion ended, had the valuable rectory of St. Andrew Holborn given him by the Queen. At that time his reputation was &s;o high, that he was enabled to &s;ell the fir&s;t &s;ermon, preached after his &s;entence expired, for the &s;um of 100l.; and upwards of 40,000 copies, it is &s;aid, were &s;oon fold. We find by Swift's Journal to Stella, Jan. 22, 1711-12, that he had al&s;o intere&s;t enough with the mini&s;try to provide very amply for one of his bro|thers; yet, as the Dean had &s;aid before, Aug. 24, 1711, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they hated, and affected to de&s;pi&s;e him."</Q> In 1716, he prefixed a dedication to "Fifteen Di&s;cour&s;es, occa&s;ionally de|livered before the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, by W. Adams, M.A. late &s;tudent of Chri&s;t Church, and rector of Staunton upon Wye, in Oxford&s;hire." After this publication, we hear little of him, except by quarrels with his pari&s;hioners, al|though he was much &s;u&s;pected to be concerned in Atterbury's plot. A con&s;iderable e&s;tate at Callow in Derby&s;hire was left to him by his kin&s;man Geo. Sacheverell, e&s;q. He died June 5, 1724; and, by his will, bequeathed to Bi&s;hop Atterbury, then in exile, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have penned his defence for him, the &s;um of 500l. By a letter to him from his uncle, 1711, it appears, that he had a brother named Thomas, and a &s;i&s;ter Su&s;annah. &mdash; The dutche&s;s of Marlborough de&s;cribes him as
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an ignorant impudent incendiary; a man who was the &s;corn even of tho&s;e who made u&s;e of him as a tool."</Q>
Account, &amp;c. p. 247. &mdash; And Bp. Burnet &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He was a bold in&s;olent man, with a very &s;mall mea&s;ure of religion, virtue, learning, or good &s;en&s;e; but he re&s;olved to force him&s;elf into popularity and preferment, by the mo&s;t petulant railings at Di&s;&s;enters and Low-church men, in &s;everal &s;ermons and libels, wrote without either cha&s;te|ne&s;s of &s;tyle, or liveline&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion."</Q>

In the "Supplement to Swift," I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, from Mr. Granger, that Roche&s;ter had natural mode&s;ty. The fact is, he wrote but little of the ribaldry which pa&s;&s;es under his name; but, having obtained the character of a lewd writer, every thing in that &s;train was fathered upon him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In all his works,"</Q> Dr. John&s;on &s;ays,

<HEAD>ON THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. PARNELL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Parnell, D.D. de&s;cended from an antient fa|mily of Congleton in Che&s;hire, was born in Dublin, in the year 1679; and was admitted a member of Dublin College at the early age of thirteen. He took his degree of M.A. July 9, 1700; and in the &s;ame year was ordained a deacon by Dr. William King, then bi&s;hop of Derry, having a di&s;|pen&s;ation from the primate, as being under twenty-three years of age. He was admitted into prie&s;ts orders about three years after, by Dr. King, then archbi&s;hop of Dublin; and was collated by Dr. St. George A&s;he, bi&s;hop of Clogher, to the archdeaconry of Clogher, Feb. 9, 1705. About that time al&s;o he married Mi&s;s Anne Minchin, a young lady of great merit and beauty, by whom he had two &s;ons, who died young, and a daughter, living in 1770. Swift, in his Journal to Stella, Augu&s;t 24, 1712, &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am heartily for poor Mrs. Parnell's death: &s;he &s;eemed ro be an excel|lent good-natured young woman, and I believe the poor lad is much afflicted: they appeared to live perfectly well to|gether."</Q>
This event is &s;uppo&s;ed to have made an indelible impre&s;&s;ion on his &s;pirits. He was warmly recommended by the Dean to archbi&s;hop King: who gave him a prebend in 1713, and the vicarage of Finglas (worth about 400 l. a year) May 31, 1716. His gratitude is beautifully expre&s;&s;ed in a poem on the Dean's birth-day, 1713. He died at Che&s;ter, in July 1718, on his way to Ireland; and was buried in Trinity church in that town, without any monu|ment to mark the place of his interment. As he left no male i&s;&s;ue, his e&s;tate devolved to his only nephew, Sir Sir John Parnell, baronet, who&s;e father was younger brother to the archdeacon, and one of the ju&s;tices of the king's bench in Ireland. The character of Dr. Parnell is admirably pour|trayed by Dr. Gold&s;mith, in the Life prefixed to a volume of his Poems, originally publi&s;hed by Mr. Pope, in 1721. A po&s;thumous volume was printed at Dublin in 1758. And both the&s;e volumes united, with &s;everal additional poems which I had formerly collected, are printed in the forty-fourth volume of the "Engli&s;h Poets."

<L>Each da&s;tard virtue drags a captive's chain,</L>
<L>And moves but &s;lowly, for it moves with pain:</L>
<L>Dome&s;tic cares &s;it hard upon the mind,</L>
<L>And cramp tho&s;e thoughts which &s;hould be unconfin'd;</L>
<L>The cries of Poverty alarm the &s;oul,</L>
<L>Abate its vigour, its de&s;igns control:</L>
<L>The &s;tings of Want inflict the wounds of Death,</L>
<L>And motion always cea&s;es with the breath.</L>
<L>The love of friends is found a languid fire,</L>
<L>That glares but faintly, and will &s;oon expire;</L>
<L>Weak is its force, nor can its warmth be great,</L>
<L>A feeble light begets a feeble heat.</L>
<L>Wealth is the fuel that mu&s;t feed the flame,</L>
<L>It dies in rags, and &s;carce de&s;erves a name.</L>

I cannot but take this opportunity of correcting a mi&s;take (which I was led into by Dr. Birch) in the note on the Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XLIV. p. 263. What is there &s;aid on the Poem on Queen Anne's Peace more probably belongs to this E&s;&s;ay. The peace was not &s;igned till March 30, 1713. By Swift's Journal to Stella, Dec. 22, 25, 1712, Jan. 6. 17, 31, and Feb. 19, 1712-13, it appears that this poem received &s;everal corrections in con&s;equence of hints from Dr. Swift, who introduced Parnell both to Oxford and Bolingbroke.

<HEAD>TO HENRY LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. PARNELL<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Allegory is in it&s;elf &s;o retired a way of Writing, that it was thought proper to &s;ay &s;omething beforehand con|cerning this Piece, which is entirely framed upon it. The de&s;ign, therefore, is to &s;hew the &s;everal Styles which have been made u&s;e of by tho&s;e who have endeavoured to write in ver&s;e. The &s;cheme, by which it is carried on, &s;uppo&s;es an old Gre|cian Poet couching his ob&s;ervations or in&s;tructions within an Allegory; which Allegory is wrought out upon the &s;ingle word Flight, as in the figurative way it &s;ignifies a thought above the common level: here Wit is made to be Pega&s;us, and the Poet his Rider, who flies by &s;everal countries where he mu&s;t not touch, by which are meant &s;o many vicious Styles, and arrives at la&s;t at the Sublime. This way of Writing is not only very engaging to the fancy whenever it is well performed; but it has been thought al&s;o one of the fir&s;t that the Poets made u&s;e of. Hence aro&s;e many of tho&s;e &s;tories concerning the Heathen Gods, which at fir&s;t were in|vented to in&s;inuate Truth and Morality more plea&s;ingly, and which afterwards made Poetry it&s;elf more &s;olemn, when they happened to be received into the Heathen Divinity. And indeed there &s;eems to be no likelier way by which a Poetical Genius may yet appear as an Original, than that he &s;hould proceed with a full compa&s;s of thought and knowledge, ei|ther to de&s;ign his plan, or to beautify the parts of it, in an allegorical manner. We are much beholden to Antiquity
for tho&s;e excellent compo&s;itions by which Writers at pre&s;ent form their minds; but it is not &s;o much required of us to ad|here merely to their fables, as to ob&s;erve their manner. For, if we preclude our own invention, Poetry will con&s;i&s;t only in expre&s;&s;ion, or &s;imile, or the application of old &s;tories; and the utmo&s;t character to which a Genius can arrive will depend on imitation, or a borrowing from others, which we mu&s;t agree together not to call &s;tealing, becau&s;e we take only from the Ancients. There have been Poets among&s;t our&s;elves, &s;uch as Spen&s;er and Milton, who have &s;ucce&s;sfully ventured further. The&s;e in&s;tances may let us &s;ee that Invention is not bounded by what has been done before: they may open our imaginations, and be one method of pre&s;erving us from Writing without &s;chemes. As for what relates any further particularly to this Poem, the Reader will ob&s;erve, that its aim is In&s;truction. Perhaps a repre&s;entation of &s;everal mi&s;|takes and difficulties, which happen to many who write Poe|try, may deter &s;ome from attempting what they have not been made for: and perhaps the de&s;cription of &s;everal beau|ties belonging to it may afford hints towards forming a Genius for delighting and improving mankind. If either of the&s;e happen, the Poem is u&s;eful; and upon that account its faults may be more ea&s;ily excu&s;ed. PARNELL.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

Neither are they tho&s;e Rats which greaze their throats in Fallow-chandlers &s;hops, where they nibble &s;o much upon candles, that not one pound in an hundred is ever full weight.

<BYLINE>BY JOHN CROWNE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A dramatic writer, who&s;e performances both in comedy and tragedy were acted with applau&s;e, though comedy &s;eems to have been more peculiarly his talent. Seventeen of his plays are enumerated by Jacob. He was bred under his father, an independent mini&s;ter in Nova Scotia. Being a man of &s;ome genius, and impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country, he re&s;olved upon coming to England, to try if he could not make his fortune by his wits. When he fir&s;t arrived here, his nece&s;&s;ities were ex|tremely urgent: and he was obliged to become a gentleman-u&s;her to an old Independent lady. But he &s;oon grew as weary of that preci&s;e office, as he was of the di&s;cipline of Nova Scotia. He &s;et him&s;elf therefore to writing; and pre&s;ently made him&s;elf &s;o known to the court and town, that he was no|minated by Charles II. to write "The Ma&s;que of Calyp&s;o." This nomination was procured him by the earl of Roche&s;ter: it mu&s;t not however be a&s;cribed entirely to his merit, but to &s;ome little &s;pite in this lord, who de&s;igned by that pre|ference to mortify Mr. Dryden. Upon the breaking-out of the two parties, after the pretended di&s;covery of the Popi&s;h plot, the favour Crowne was in at court induced him to embrace the Tory party; about which time he wrote a comedy called "The City Politicks," in order to &s;atirize and expo&s;e the Whigs. This comedy was by many intrigues of the party-men hindered from appearing upon the &s;tage, till the king him&s;elf laid his ab&s;olute commands on the lord cham|berlain to have it acted immediately. About the latter end of this reign, Crowne, tired out with writing, and de&s;irous to &s;helter him&s;elf from the re&s;entment of many enemies he had made by his "City Politicks," ventured to addre&s;s the king him&s;elf, for an e&s;tabli&s;hment in &s;ome office that might be a &s;ecurity to him for life. The king an&s;wered,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he &s;hould be provided for;"</Q>
but added,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he would fir&s;t &s;ee another comedy."</Q>
Mr. Crowne endeavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by telling the king, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he plotted &s;lowly and aukwardly."</Q>
His maje&s;ty replied, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he would help him to a plot;"</Q>
and &s;o put into his hand the Spani&s;h comedy, called "Non pued e&s;&s;er," out of which Mr. Crowne took the comedy of "Sir Courtly Nice" The play was ju&s;t ready to appear to the world; and Mr. Crowne extremely delighted to think that he was going to be made happy the remaining part of his life, by the performance of the king's promi&s;e. But, upon the la&s;t day of the rehear&s;al, he met Underhill the player coming from the hou&s;e as he was going to it; upon which, reprimanding him for neglecting &s;o con&s;iderable a part as he had in the comedy, and upon the la&s;t day too;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord, Sir, &s;ays Underhill, we are all un|done."
&mdash; "How! &s;ays Crowne, is the playhou&s;e on fire?"
"The whole nation, replies the player, will quickly be &s;o, for the king is dead."</Q>
The king's death ruined Crowne, who had now nothing but his wits to live on for the re|maining part of his life. It is not certain when he died, but it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omewhere about the year 1703. See Dennis's Letters, 1721, vol. I. p. 48. and the Biographical Dictionary, 8vo. Mr. Crowne was author of two other poems, called "Pandion and Amphiginia," and "Daeneids." N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TO JOHN EARL OF MULGRAVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE long been a&s;hamed to &s;ee &s;o many of my writings march into the world, and yet, not one of them honoured by your lord&s;hip's patronage. It is an ea&s;y matter for a troop to force them&s;elves on ladies and
<PB N="281" REF="284">
neutral gentlemen, or nobility, who will not arm; but they mu&s;t be men of &s;ome merit and gallantry, who compel regard from a General. Your lord&s;hip is as much above us in our own ways, as you are in other re&s;pects; and I give this manife&s;t proof of it: your fortune, and, mo&s;t men believe, your inclination, fixes you on the top of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure; therefore you would never have written one line, if it had co&s;t you any pains: yet have you performed ma&s;teries, which we, who
<PB N="282" REF="285">
make poetry the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives, could never equal. In your E&s;&s;ay on Poetry there appears to me a commanding genius &s;tanding on a ri&s;e, over-looking the age you live in, &s;eeing all the writers in it marching below you, and too often di&s;orderly; and you give us tho&s;e orders which plainly &s;hew, Poetry attends on you, you may do what you plea&s;e with it; but we, compared with your lord&s;hip, are but poor drudges to it, that have oftener the will than the power to do well. Your lord&s;hip has not only a perfect under&s;tanding of what is fit to pa&s;s in the world, but you are of a &s;evere temper, which will not give your pa&s;s to any fal&s;e &s;en&s;e; the ab&s;ence therefore of your name from my writings &s;eems a &s;ilent charge again&s;t me of want of merit. To remove that reproach, I take this occa&s;ion to tell the world, your lord&s;hip has approved of &s;ome of my writings; and I have longed to make my brags of it, but have been hindered either by the unkindne&s;s of for|tune, which has given me &s;ome blow, and made me unfit to appear before you, or by the kindne&s;s of &s;ome generous per&s;ons, by which my writings have been in a manner mortgaged. Though the law of the land does not reckon favour freely be&s;towed among debts, the law of gratitude does; whenever a man is obliged, a judgement is entered again&s;t him. In the late reign, when your lord&s;hip graced the Lord Chamberlain's office, you were plea&s;ed to &s;hew me tho&s;e regards which made me vain: and I was very de&s;irous to make it known to the world, but the cloudine&s;s of tho&s;e times got I think into my head, I did not write &s;o well as I
<PB N="283" REF="286">
have done formerly. Now I venture before your lord|&s;hip, becau&s;e I bring an acquaintance of yours, I am &s;ure you value, Mr. Boileau; and a piece of his all men of &s;en&s;e have e&s;teemed, becau&s;e it expo&s;es to con|tempt men who are the antipodes to good &s;en&s;e; prie&s;ts who advance non&s;en&s;e above rea&s;on, make trifles of the mo&s;t &s;olemn matters, and &s;olemn things of trifles, are idle in the great affairs of their calling, and bu&s;y in impertinence. By the few we have had among&s;t us of &s;uch kind of Churchmen, we may gue&s;s the mi&s;ery of the people who live in the Roman Church, where there are &s;carce any other; where the whole ma&s;s of prie&s;t|hood is a heap of proud fle&s;h, and all the &s;trength and nutriment of a nation goes to feed eccle&s;ia&s;tical cor|ruption; thanks be to God, we are in a condition to make &s;port with them; if ever they come among&s;t us, they will &s;poil the je&s;t. And, pa&s;t di&s;pute, it is very fit to render men contemptible who endeavour to make Re|ligion &s;o. We have had too many in our Church who have bu&s;ied them&s;elves, and embroiled others about things which the French have had the under&s;tanding to know were only fit for a droll. But now we have greater affairs on our hand. We have not time to con|tend for modes in Religion, when the Being of the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, and indeed the Engli&s;h Nation, lies at &s;take. In a calm at &s;ea, men may have lei&s;ure to wrangle at Che&s;s; but, if a &s;torm ari&s;es, the quarrel is at an end, and the bi&s;hops, knights, rooks, and pawns, that bred it, are left to &s;hift for them&s;elves. I am well a&s;&s;ured the Lutrin plea&s;es your lord&s;hip, but I may doubt of
<PB N="284" REF="287">
my management of it; for I treat it as an Engli&s;h pri|vateer would do a French prize, great part of it I &s;ling away, and I da&s;h, brew, and di&s;gui&s;e, the re&s;t as I think good. I &s;hall not value how the world cen&s;ures me, if I have the good-fortune to be approved of by your lord&s;hip, and thought worthy of the title of, my Lord,</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip's mo&s;t humble and obliged &s;ervant,</P>

<L>NOW do the cocks begin their morning brawl,</L>
<L>And drow&s;y Chanters to their mattins call.</L>
<L>Their Chief was troubled with a frightful dream,</L>
<L>Which made him &s;weat, and waken with a &s;cream.</L>
<L>His trembling Valets, on his &s;econd cries,</L>
<L>For&s;ake their warm enticing down, and ri&s;e.</L>

<L>He kept the Choir on the &s;ini&s;ter &s;ide,</L>

<L>When &s;leep had twice upon my eyes be&s;tow'd</L>
<L>Of drow&s;y poppies a fre&s;h-gather'd load;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then rage tongue-ty'd him; Gerot, laughing loud,</L>

<L>Pu&s;h'd on, and earlie&s;t in the Choir appears.</L>
<L>But, oh! what &s;pite and fury fir'd his blood,</L>

<L>Cunning old Gerot knew the Canons well,</L>
<L>Spar'd his worn lungs, rung the great ma&s;ter-bell;</L>
<L>Which, like the heavy Dean, but &s;erv'd for &s;tate,</L>

<L>So when, to batter down a hundred walls,</L>

<L>" Ho, breakfa&s;t waits!" the cunning Verger cries.</L>
<L>At that angelic &s;ummons, all ari&s;e:</L>

<L>For they were ready, ere their gowns were on:</L>
<L>Headlong undre&s;t to the great hall they run:</L>
<L>But, '&s;tead of breakfa&s;t, met a mournful tale,</L>

<L>To that once &s;avoury motion no man &s;poke,</L>

<L>He only, of all the Prie&s;ts our Church obey'd,</L>
<L>Had not his Latin &s;mother'd and o'erlaid.</L>

<HEAD>I. TO THE QUEEN, AT CHRIST-CHURCH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MR. HARCOURT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son to Sir Simon (afterwards lord) Harcourt. This young gentleman did not &s;ucceed to the title; as he died in 1720, &s;even years before his father. On his tomb at Stanton Harcourt is a beautiful epitaph by Mr. Pope. He was father to the fir&s;t, and grandfather to the pre&s;ent, earl Harcourt. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>WHEN haughty Monarchs their proud &s;tate expo&s;e,</L>
<L>And Maje&s;ty an aweful greatne&s;s &s;hews;</L>
<L>Their &s;ubjects, Madam, with amazement &s;eiz'd,</L>
<L>Gaze at the pomp, rather &s;urpriz'd than pleas'd.</L>
<L>But your more gentle influence imparts</L>
<L>Wonder at once and plea&s;ure to our hearts.</L>
<L>Where-e'er You come, joy &s;hines in every face;</L>
<L>Such winning goodne&s;s, &s;uch an ea&s;y grace,</L>
<L>Through all your realms diffu&s;ive kindne&s;s pours,</L>
<L>That every Engli&s;h heart 's entirely yours.</L>
<L>The Mu&s;es' &s;ons with eager tran&s;port view</L>
<L>Their long-de&s;ponding hopes reviv'd in You,</L>
<L>The Mu&s;es' &s;ons to Monarchs ever true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The&s;e happy walls, by royal bounty plac'd,</L>
<L>Often with royal pre&s;ence have been grac'd.</L>
<L>Here Kings, to ea&s;e the cares attend a crown,</L>
<L>Preferr'd the Mu&s;es' laurels to their own.</L>
<L>And here You once enjoy'd a &s;afe retreat,</L>
<L>From noi&s;e and envy free: to this lov'd &s;eat,</L>
<L>To be a gue&s;t, You then did conde&s;cend;</L>
<L>Which now, its happy guardian, You defend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oxford, with joy, beholds the Royal Pair,</L>
<L>And finds her Mu&s;es are her Prince's care.</L>
<L><PB N="314" REF="317">May we pre&s;ume to claim a nearer tye?</L>
<L>They are your Subjects, we your Family.</L>
<L>Accept the duty then we doubly owe,</L>
<L>We &s;hare your Pre&s;ence and Protection too.</L>
<L>So, when great Jove within the country cell</L>
<L>Of humble pious Baucis meant to dwell,</L>
<L>The bounteous God grac'd her with gifts divine;</L>
<L>And, where he found his refuge, fix'd his &s;hrine.</L>

<HEAD>II. TO THE PRINCE, AT CHRIST-CHURCH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MR. COWSLADE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot find who Mr. Cow&s;lade was; and it is remark|able, that not one of the&s;e four Speakers took a regular degree at the Univer&s;ity. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
<L>AND You, au&s;picious Prince, our other care,</L>
<L>Accept the duty which your I&s;is pays:</L>
<L>Whether in arts of Peace, or deeds of War,</L>
<L>The Hero ju&s;tly claims the Mu&s;e's prai&s;e.</L>
<L>A&s;piring Youth, fir'd with a generous flame,</L>

<L>And early, in imaginary times,</L>

<L>Others the milder arts of Phoebus chu&s;e,</L>

<HEAD>III. TO THE QUEEN, AT SUPPER.</HEAD>
<STAGE>BY MR. FINCH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heneage, grand&s;on to the fir&s;t earl of Nottingham. His father was created baron Guern&s;ey, March 16, 1703; and earl of Aylesford, Oct. 26, 1714. &mdash; The &s;peaker of the&s;e ver&s;es died earl of Aylesford, June 26, 1757; and was grand-father to the pre&s;ent earl. N.</NOTE>.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>WITH love, though rude, we crowd this hallow'd place,</L>
<L>And clog that triumph which we mean to grace,</L>
<L>To view the Queen, that frees us from alarms,</L>
<L>Secures our quiet, and directs our arms.</L>
<L>England before its ruin'd trade deplor'd,</L>
<L>A mourning victor and di&s;puted lord.</L>
<L>Now mouldering fleets in Gallic harbours lie,</L>
<L>While Briti&s;h &s;hips their double world defy.</L>
<L>Our Mu&s;es hear the battles from afar,</L>
<L>And &s;ing the triumphs, and enjoy the war.</L>
<L>This now; but &s;oon the quivering &s;pear they'll wield,</L>
<L>And lead the &s;houting &s;quadrons to the field.</L>
<L>They'll &s;erve that Prince&s;s whom before they &s;ung,</L>
<L>Defend that Queen beneath who&s;e eye they &s;prung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So &s;preading oaks, from lovely Wind&s;or born,</L>
<L>Shall &s;helter Britain, which they now adorn:</L>
<L>With &s;welling &s;ails o'er di&s;tant &s;eas they'll go,</L>
<L>And guard that Goddefs by who&s;e care they grow.</L>

<L>MADAM, once more, th' ob&s;equious Mu&s;e,</L>
<L>With zeal and ju&s;t ambition fir'd,</L>
<L>Her grateful homage here renews,</L>
<L>In numbers by Your&s;elf in&s;pir'd:</L>

<L>May Heaven its &s;acred charge defend!</L>
