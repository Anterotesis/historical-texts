<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are conver&s;ant in the French Drama, will readily perceive that the <HI>Captive of Spilburg</HI> is little el&s;e than a tran&s;lation of <HI>Le Souter|rain.</HI> In adapting it to the Engli&s;h &s;tage, endeavours have been u&s;ed to &s;elect the mo&s;t &s;triking and in|tere&s;ting features of the Original. The principal Alteration con&s;i&s;ts in the Airs, which, when new Mu|&s;ic is to be compo&s;ed, it is &s;eldom of any advan|tage to tran&s;late.</P>
<P>Much cen&s;ure has of late been ca&s;t on the neg|ligence of tho&s;e who write <HI>words</HI> for Mu&s;ical Com|po&s;itions. &mdash;That &s;ome remi&s;sne&s;s &s;hould creep in upon a laborious ta&s;k, where the utmo&s;t diligence
<PB N="viii" REF="6">can attain little prai&s;e, will be no &s;ubject of &s;ur|prize to any one accou&s;tomed to habits of ap|plication: but that indulgence may fairly be ex|tended to writers of this de&s;cription may be infer|red from the apology made by the great Dryden for him&s;elf on this &s;ubject. In &s;peaking of the diffi|culties of our language, in mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, he &s;ays <Q>it con&s;i&s;ts too much of mono&s;yllables, and tho&s;e too mo&s;t commonly clogg'd with con&s;onants, for which rea&s;on, (he adds) I am often forced to coin new words, revive &s;ome that are antiquated, and botch others, as if I had not &s;erved out my time in Poetry, but was bound 'Prentice to &s;ome Doggrel Rhimer, who makes &s;ongs to tunes and &s;ings them for a livelihood. 'Tis true I have not been often put to this drudgery; but, <HI>where I have, the words &s;ufficiently &s;hew, that I was then a &s;lave to the compo&s;ition,</HI> which I will never be again.</Q> In fact the diligent writer of words to be adapted to Mu&s;ic goes to work with fewer materials than any other, with a vocabulary <HI>disfurni&s;hed</HI> of at lea&s;t one third of his language.
<PB N="ix" REF="7">All clo&s;e &s;ounds, all words ending in mutes, all in which many con&s;onants are perceptible to the ear; are unfavourable to, and &s;ome times incompatible with his purpo&s;e. What embarra&s;sment this re|&s;triction produces, and how greatly it impedes the efforts of a writer, <HI>Experiment</HI> will be&s;t a&s;certain.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for this &s;pecies of writing, it is likewi&s;e liable to cen&s;ure from the errors of others as well as of the writer. The Mu&s;ic of every &s;uc|ce&s;sful Dramatic Production is immediately pub|li&s;hed, and words are annexed to it, which, from the frequent inaccuracy (in that point) of the Cop|per Plate Engraver, are <HI>very fal&s;ely &s;aid to be writ|ten</HI> by the Author of the Piece. But this the judi|cious ob&s;erver will ea&s;ily di&s;criminate.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lator of the pre&s;ent Drama is as fully aware as the mo&s;t &s;plenetic critic can be, that pro|ductions of this kind are of no great importance to the retired reader. They are however the food of the Stage; and a really comprehen&s;ive and can|did
<PB N="x" REF="8">mind will not e&s;timate their merits merely by the &s;cale of Literature, but will recollect that the Theatre demands action, that the be&s;t written plays <HI>may</HI> be the mo&s;t unfit for repre&s;entation, and that without this con&s;ideration the mo&s;t accurate judge of books will be a very inadequate cen&s;or of dra|matic writings.</P>
