<L>Whil&s;t thy grim Lion grinds thy foes to death:<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 14. <HI>Whil&s;t thy grim Lion grinds thy foes to death.</HI>] Our author &s;eems here to have an eye to a very curious piece of hi&s;tory, in the <HI>London Daily Adverti&s;er,</HI> of <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> 8, 1752, which runs thus:</P><Q>We hear from the <HI>Bedford Coffee-Hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> that an unhappy Gen|tleman of that neighbourhood, having ye&s;terday morning in wantonne&s;s, thru&s;t his head into the mouth of the Lion that re&s;ides there, felt the jaws unexpectedly clo&s;e up|on him: On this, enquiring with a hollow voice, whether he &s;hook his tail, and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he begged the by-&s;tanders to pray for him. A ter|rible cra&s;h was immediately after heard, and notwith&s;tanding the uncommon re&s;i&s;|&s;tance of the &s;kull, it is credibly reported, that the teeth met through it. He was im|mediately after conveyed home, but his Surgeons are afraid the wounds will prove mortal. <BIBL>Dr. HILL.</BIBL></Q><P>It is not material to con&s;ider how much <HI>wit</HI> or <HI>truth</HI> is in this paragraph, if it &s;erves to give the public a great idea of the &s;aid Lion.</P></NOTE></L>
