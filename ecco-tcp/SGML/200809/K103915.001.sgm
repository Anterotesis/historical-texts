<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Chevalier DES ESSARS AND THE Counte&s;s of BERCI.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD> PART I.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Reign of one of the greate&s;t Princes the French Monarchy ever had, lived a young Noble|man equally illu&s;trious for his Vir|tues, and the Grandeur of his De&s;cent. The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> is the Name I &s;hall give him here. His Per&s;on was genteel and elegant, his Manners &s;oft and in&s;inuating. He was in high E&s;teem for his Valour; and his Fidelity to his Ma&s;ter during tho&s;e Troubles which di&s;turbed the fir&s;t Years of the Reign of Henry IV, acquired him the E&s;teem of that great King, who knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h, and loved to reward Merit.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">With &s;uch Advantages of Nature and For|tune, it will be ea&s;ily imagined, the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> could not be un&s;ucce&s;sful in a well-placed Pa&s;&s;ion: nor indeed was he &s;uffered to &s;igh long for the Daughter of the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> whom he demanded in Marriage. The Marquis approved of his Ad|dre&s;&s;es, and the young Lady gave him her Hand without Reluctance.</P>
<P>The Count and Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Years of their Marriage in the cha&s;te Plea&s;ures of a tender Union. The Count neglected no Opportunity to procure for his Wife all tho&s;e Amu&s;ements which it is natu|ral for Per&s;ons of her Sex and Years to be fond of: and the Counte&s;s, on her Side, made it her chief Care to merit his E&s;teem by an exact and prudent Conduct, and pre&s;erve his Love by her Softne&s;s and Attention to plea&s;e. Hymen lavi&s;hed on this amiable Pair his choice&s;t Favours: their Love, always tender and &s;incere, was always uniform and con&s;tant, neither embittered with Jealou&s;y, nor palled by any of tho&s;e Di&s;gu&s;ts which too often fol|low the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what we have mo&s;t ar|dently de&s;ired.</P>
<P>But this Happine&s;s was not to la&s;t for ever. The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> happened to &s;ee the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> one Evening at the Play: to &s;ee her, and to love her with the mo&s;t ar|dent Pa&s;&s;ion, was the &s;ame Thing. The Che|valier's Birth was noble; his Face, tho' beau|tiful to Exce&s;s, was without Effeminacy;
<PB N="3" REF="4">
his Per&s;on, tho' eminently genteel, was bold and manly; to the frank and ea&s;y Manners of a Soldier, he joined the poli&s;hed Elegance of a Court. His early Valour had made him remarkable in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the following Pages of this Hi&s;tory will furni&s;h &s;uch amazing Proofs of his Courage as would tran&s;cend Be|lief, if the Hi&s;tories of pa&s;t Ages, had not given Credibility to the Exploits of tho&s;e He|roes who filled the World with their Glory and their Virtues.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was then in his thirtieth Year, and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> ju&s;t turned of eighteen. Her Stature was tall, her Shape ea&s;y and delicate, her Complexion fine and animated, her Eyes were large, black, and full of Fire; all the Features of her Face were regular and charming; a thou&s;and name|le&s;s Graces were diffu&s;ed over her whole Form, and captivated the Heart of every Be|holder. Yet this Per&s;on, lovely as it was, was her lea&s;t Perfection. She had a fine Under&s;tanding, cultivated by Reading and Reflexion; a Wit lively and plea&s;ing; a noble and generous Mind, and a Sweetne&s;s in her Manners that &s;ecured all tho&s;e Hearts which the Charms of her Per&s;on had fir&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ed. But truly admirable as all the&s;e Qua|lities were, it was that unclouded Rea&s;on, that &s;olid Virtue, that noble Fortitude, and that blamele&s;s Conduct, which &s;he con&s;tantly maintained even in her greate&s;t Misfortunes and the mo&s;t dangerous Circum&s;tances of her Life, that crowned and gave a Lu&s;tre to them all.
<PB N="4" REF="5">
She was early taught, that Beauty, when not accompanied by Virtue and the brighter Graces of the Mind, could never hope for the E&s;teem of wi&s;e and good Men, who&s;e Eyes it only plea&s;ed, but could not extend its Influence to the Heart: and that the greate&s;t per&s;onal Ad|vantages, if not &s;trengthened by Virtue, were the mo&s;t fatal Gifts, that Nature could di&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> felt all the Force of the&s;e Maxims; &s;he received and lodged them in her Heart, and regulated by them the whole Conduct of her Life; and if &s;he, at length, felt &s;ome Sen&s;ibility for the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> &s;he re|&s;trained it within &s;uch &s;trict Bounds that it never endangered her Virtue; and by her prudent Conduct &s;he changed the mo&s;t im|petuous Man in the World, into the mo&s;t re|&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Lover that ever was.</P>
<P>But it is now Time to return to the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> At the fir&s;t Sight of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> her Charms made a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Heart, he was &s;o wholly engro&s;&s;ed by them, that he was indifferent to all Things el&s;e, nor could he give a Mo|ment's Attention to any other Object. When the Play was ended, he eagerly enquired the Name of that enchanting fair One, and was overjoyed to find he might love her without blu&s;hing. He returned home full of plea&s;ing Anxiety: a new and &s;weet Di&s;order po&s;&s;e&s;t him. How altered in a few Hours! He was no more: that fiery Warrior, who&s;e Soul till
<PB N="5" REF="6">
then, had been acce&s;&s;ible to no other Pa&s;&s;ion but Glory. The Image of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> took full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Brea&s;t, and the Conque&s;t of her Heart was the only Am|bition he was now &s;en&s;ible of. Oh powerful Love! how in a Moment do&s;t thou fix thy Empire in our Souls, and &s;u&s;pend or de&s;troy every other Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> would have re|joiced to find that the Object of his Pa&s;&s;ion had been &s;ingle, and at Liberty to receive his Vows. Her being married was a Circum|&s;tance which gave him great Grief and Per|plexity; he even made &s;ome Efforts to van|qui&s;h his new-born Love: Company, Di&s;&s;i|pation, and the Remon&s;trances of his Friends might perhaps, have rendered tho&s;e Efforts effectual; but he, on the contrary, delivered him&s;elf up to Solitude, and conver&s;ing only with his own Thoughts, his Rea&s;on became &s;ubjected to his Love: he flattered him&s;elf that he might love without a Crime; his di&s;|ordered Imagination &s;ugge&s;ted a thou&s;and vain Chimera's, and leaving it to Time and For|tune to make him happy, he abandoned him|&s;elf entirely to the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion. Although he had never &s;een the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> till that fatal Evening at the Play, yet he had &s;ome &s;light Acquaintance with the Count; and he conceived that the be&s;t Way to get an Introduction to the Wife, was to commence a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with the Hu&s;|band. And here his Succe&s;s was an&s;werable to his Wi&s;hes. The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> thought
<PB N="6" REF="7">
it an Honour to be ranked among the parti|cular Friends of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and met his Advances with &s;uch Eagerne&s;s, that in a &s;hort Time they became in&s;eparable.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> was continually talking to his Wife of the great Merit of the Che|valier: he made one in all their Parties of Plea&s;ure. The Counte&s;s, to plea&s;e her Lord, took all Opportunities of &s;hewing the Re&s;pect and E&s;teem &s;he had for him; and the Cheva|lier at fir&s;t only di&s;covered a profound Venera|tion for the Counte&s;s: but his Pa&s;&s;ion gaining daily new Force by the frequent Opportuni|ties he had of &s;eeing the lovely Object of it, it was with the utmo&s;t Difficulty he con|cealed the Secret of his Heart; and, weary of the intolerable Re&s;traint, he re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t favourable Moment to reveal his Love without giving the Count any Su&s;picion: and this De&s;ign employed all his Thoughts.</P>
<P>In effect, it was very difficult to execute: but what will not a Lover attempt, who lives in the mo&s;t terrible Uncertainty of his Fate? The Chevalier, to prevent giving the Count any Su&s;picions, had at fir&s;t regulated all his Actions, his Words, and even his Looks, with &s;o much Prudence that nothing e&s;caped him in his Pre&s;ence which could di&s;|cover his real Sentiments: he was neither too free, nor too re&s;erved, and kept &s;o ju&s;t a Mean; that his Behaviour had not the lea&s;t Appearance of Artifice, or Affectation. The Count and Chevalier were always together,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
and every Day was di&s;tingui&s;hed with &s;ome new Amu&s;ement. A&s;&s;emblies, Tournaments, Running at the Ring, each had a Place in this Circle of Plea&s;ures. The two Friends were always the Challengers in every Tour|nament, and never failed to give the mo&s;t &s;hining Proofs of their Valour and Dexterity.</P>
<P>In former Times the French Nobility were pa&s;&s;ionately fond of all tho&s;e Diver&s;ions which at fir&s;t were in&s;tituted in Honour of the Ladies. The Prizes, which the Victors always received from their Hands, was a Spur to their Emula|tion: and early incited them to form them&s;elves for all tho&s;e Exerci&s;es which it became every Nobleman to be &s;kilful in. But Tourna|ments, which are natural Repre&s;entations of Battles, however proper they might be to in|&s;truct the young Nobility in the military Art, were notwith&s;tanding aboli&s;hed in <HI>France,</HI> as being thought too dangerous. No one can be ignorant of the fatal Accident that hap|pened to Henry the Second, one of our Kings, who died of a Wound he received in a Tour|nament, in the forty fir&s;t Year of his Age, and the thirteenth of his Reign. Tourna|ments and Running at the Ring were &s;till in U&s;e in the Times I am &s;peaking of, and they were the mo&s;t &s;plendid and mo&s;t noble Amu&s;e|ments in the Court of our Kings. I hope the Reader will pardon this &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion, the &s;ucceeding Part of this Hi&s;tory will &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity of it. But let us now return to our noble Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> had a Ta&s;te for Magnificence and Plea&s;ure. The Chevalier was always with him either at his Hou&s;e, or at &s;ome public Diver&s;ion, after which, till the Hour of Supper arrived, they amu&s;ed them|&s;elves with walking in &s;ome of tho&s;e en|chanting Gardens which con&s;titute one of the chief Plea&s;ures of <HI>Paris.</HI> The charming Counte&s;s made one in all their Parties. The Chevalier would have thought them in&s;ipid without her Pre&s;ence: but &s;till no Opportu|nity offered to &s;peak to her in private. In vain he endeavoured to conceal his Torments; the &s;oft Languor that appeared in his Eyes when he met tho&s;e of the Counte&s;s, gave her &s;ome Su&s;picion of his Pa&s;&s;ion; but the unfor|tunate Lover gained no Advantage from tho&s;e Su&s;picions. At length the fatal Flame that preyed upon his Heart began to affect his Health, he grew pale and wan, a fixed Me|lancholy appeared in his Countenance and Behaviour.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> was greatly affect|ed with the Situation in which he &s;aw his Friend.
<Q>What ails you, my dear Cheva|lier,</Q>
&s;aid he to him one Day when they were walking together;
<Q>&s;ome &s;ecret Grief lies heavy upon your Heart. Is your Fa|vour at Court declining, or does &s;ome one of the Beauties that adorn it hold you in her Chains, and by her Rigour occa&s;ion this &s;trange Alteration in you? Speak, my dear Chevalier, open your Heart freely to me, and be a&s;&s;ured, that my Fidelity in keeping
<PB N="9" REF="10">
your Secret, will not be le&s;s than my Con|cern for your Misfortunes.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier was a little di&s;concerted by this Di&s;cour&s;e of his Friend. 'My dear Count, &s;aid he, endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s a Sigh which neverthele&s;s would force its Way;
<Q>how oblig|ing is this tender Anxiety of yours. Believe me, there are few Evils in Life that would give me much Affliction with &s;uch a Friend to alleviate them. But indeed I have no Rea|&s;on to complain of my bad Fortune: the King is &s;till plea&s;ed to continue his Favour towards me; and my Heart, hitherto in&s;en|&s;ible to the Charms of Love, has e&s;caped the Chains of any of our Beauties, whom I have beheld with an Indifference that pre|&s;erved my Freedom. Ambition is the &s;ole Pa&s;&s;ion of my Soul, and the De&s;ire of ac|quiring Glory takes up all my Thoughts: Ever &s;ince our invincible Monarch has been in peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne of his Ance&s;tors, the French Nobility have lan|gui&s;hed in a &s;hameful Inactivity. I can no longer bear to lead this inglorious Life, and am determined to &s;eek for Laurels in other Countries, which I will water with the Blood of our Enemies. The De&s;ire of Glo|ry, my Friend, is the Pa&s;&s;ion that con&s;umes me, hence proceeds that Di&s;content you have ob&s;erved in me; and that Languor your Tenderne&s;s has likewi&s;e taken Notice of, is cau&s;ed by a &s;light Indi&s;po&s;ition with which I have been troubled for &s;ome Days pa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">'I am willing to believe you, Chevalier,' replied the Count:
<Q>but if there is any Foun|dation for the Report that now prevails of a Rupture between the King and the Empe|ror, you will not need to go far to &s;eek Occa&s;ions of acquiring Glory, and of &s;igna|li&s;ing your Valour. As for the Indi&s;po&s;i|tion you complain of, I am per&s;uaded the Air of the Country will contribute greatly to remove it. It is now the mo&s;t agreeable Sea&s;on of the Year. The Counte&s;s and my|&s;elf intend to &s;et out in a few Days for my E&s;tate of <HI>Beauplan</HI>; it is but a few Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> where the King is at pre&s;ent. We will go from Time to Time to pay our Re&s;pects to his Maje&s;ty; and we will endeavour to make your Stay at <HI>Beauplan</HI> &s;o agreeable, that you &s;hall be quite freed from your Melancholy. Come, you mu&s;t go with us, I de&s;ire it as a Fa|vour; and be a&s;&s;ured you cannot give the Counte&s;s a more &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure: &s;he e&s;teems you greatly; and the Alteration &s;he has ob&s;erved in your Health gives her no le&s;s Unea&s;ine&s;s than it has done me.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier eagerly accepted a Propo&s;al &s;o conformable to his Wi&s;hes. The Count's la&s;t Words gave him a &s;weet Emotion, that might have been ea&s;ily di&s;covered in his Countenance, had not the Arrival of the re&s;t of the Company, who joined them that In&s;tant, concealed it from his Ob&s;ervation. The Conver&s;ation now became general, and during the re&s;t of the Time that they continued walking, they &s;poke
<PB N="11" REF="12">
of nothing but the Plea&s;ures and Amu&s;ements the Country would afford them.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Chevalier, who never, &s;ince the Commencement of his fatal Pa&s;&s;ion, had had Room to entertain the lea&s;t Sentiment of Joy, re&s;igned him&s;elf up to the plea&s;ing Hopes with which the new Propo&s;al of his Friend in&s;pired him. He flattered him|&s;elf that, while he continued in the Hou&s;e of his beloved Counte&s;s, he could not &s;ail of meeting with frequent Opportunities of en|tertaining her alone, in one of which he might a&s;&s;ume Courage enough to declare his Pa&s;&s;ion; at lea&s;t he hoped that the calm Plea|&s;ures of the Retirement he was going to, would alleviate his Cares. Full of the&s;e &s;oothing Ideas he &s;et out for <HI>Beauplan</HI>; but he &s;oon found that Groves and Meads, thick Woods and winding Alleys, with the &s;oft Mu&s;ick of Birds, and murmuring Streams, were powerful Aids to Love, and while they &s;oothed, increa&s;ed his Flame. He had likewi&s;e vainly hoped that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hould find his Mi&s;tre&s;s le&s;s engaged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to form their Ar|rival at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> all the neigh|bouring Gentry came to pay their Re&s;pects to the Count and his Lady, and for fifteen Days there was &s;uch a con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion of Vi&s;itors at the Ca&s;tle, that the Chevalier ne|ver found the Counte&s;s alone one Moment, during that whole Time.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Chevalier was now in a wor&s;e Situation than he had ever been. The
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Amu&s;ements of the Country had no Charms for him, all Company was irk&s;ome, he &s;ought Solitude and Silence, and there without Re|&s;traint abandoned him&s;elf to the gloomy Re|flexions which filled his Soul. The&s;e frequent Ab&s;ences giving the Count great Unea&s;ine&s;s, he u&s;ed to go in Search of him, and always found him either in the wilde&s;t Part of the Fore&s;t, or in &s;ome romantic Cave, &s;wallowed up in deep Reflexion, with his Eyes fixed on one particular Object, which neverthele&s;s he &s;eemed not to regard; his Mind being whol|ly employed upon what pa&s;&s;ed within it. The Count was now convinced that his Friend had di&s;gui&s;ed the true Situation of his Heart, and that the Noi&s;e and Tumult of <HI>Paris</HI> were more likely to cure his Di&s;order, than the Privacy of the Country.</P>
<P>The Count, who neglected nothing which he thought could di&s;&s;ipate his Melancholy, obliged him one Day to make one in a Party for the Chace: they were to hunt the Stag. The Counte&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> at home with a Bro|ther of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, a Youth about twenty Years o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he had dined, de&s;ired her Brother to walk out with her, to meet the Hunters in their Return. They had already entered a Wood who&s;e dark embowering Shades for ever ex|cluded the Sun, and made it look like the eter|nal Abode of Solitude and Silence. She &s;at down at the Root of a Tree to re&s;t her&s;elf a Moment, when her Attention was imme|diately engaged by the Voice of a Per&s;on
<PB N="13" REF="14">
whom, although &s;he did not &s;ee, &s;he knew to be but at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from her. She ro&s;e up in&s;tantly, and with her Brother-in-law walked &s;oftly towards the Place from whence this Voice &s;eemed to come, and being now very near &s;he heard di&s;tinctly the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>Unhappy Wretch, what is it thou hope&s;t for? Why do&s;t thou wa&s;te the mi&s;erable Re|mains of thy Life in this wild Solitude? Art thou re&s;olved to die thus ob&s;curely, and not have the melancholy Plea&s;ure of letting her, for whom thou die&s;t, know the Sacri|fice thou make&s;t her? Ah! too lovely Counte&s;s, added he after a Moment's Pau&s;e, is it po&s;&s;ible that my Eyes have not di&s;co|vered to you the Flame you have kind|led in my Heart? Sure, if you knew the Torments I &s;uffer, your Compa&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t would meet the Wretch you have un|done. No, no, I deceive my&s;elf; your haughty Virtue would &s;ugge&s;t to you that I ought to die unpitied and unlamented. Wretch that I am, dare I avow &s;uch Sen|timents? Is it for me to form &s;uch auda|cious Hopes! Is it for me to make &s;uch unju&s;t Complaints? Ought I not rather to blu&s;h at my own Ba&s;ene&s;s, I who &s;eek to violate the &s;acred Rights of Ho&s;pitality, and break through all the tender Ties of Friend|&s;hip? Yet, alas! mine is an involuntary Crime, I love, and who can re&s;i&s;t the Force of that imperious Pa&s;&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">He re&s;ted for &s;ome Moments on this Thought, which &s;eemed to calm his Sorrow as it palliated his Crime, and le&s;&s;ened his own Remor&s;e. But again with new Sighs he continued his mourn|ful Soliloquy in this Manner:
<Q>It is true, O adorable Counte&s;s, that, when I fir&s;t be|held you, I was no longer Ma&s;ter of my Heart; you triumphed over it in Spite of my&s;elf, and I am &s;en&s;ible your Power will not cea&s;e but with my Life. But oh! how long will this mi&s;erable Life endure, unle&s;s I a&s;&s;ume Courage enough to reveal my Pa&s;|&s;ion. Ah! you will doubtle&s;s puni&s;h me for my Temerity: yet I am re&s;olved to di&s;clo&s;e my fatal Secret, and, before your Eyes will pierce this unhappy Brea&s;t, if I am not able to move &s;ome Pity in yours.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> unwilling to hear more, left the Fore&s;t with Precipitation. It was not difficult for her to di&s;cover that &s;he her&s;elf was the Subject of tho&s;e Complaints &s;he had ju&s;t heard, and that it was the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> who had uttered them. That unhappy Lover, who had with much Diffi|culty been per&s;uaded to hunt that Day, took the fir&s;t Opportunity that offered to with|draw, and was returning to the Ca&s;tle with a Re&s;olution to di&s;cover his Pa&s;&s;ion to the Coun|te&s;s. But the natural Timidity of a Lover re&s;training him, in&s;tead of entering, he took a Path that carried him from the Ca&s;tle, and following it, found him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly at the Entrance of this Wood; its Gloomine&s;s plea&s;ed
<PB N="15" REF="16">
him, he alighted from his Hor&s;e, and tying it to a Tree, wandered about on Foot a long Time, till being tired, he threw him&s;elf down under the Shade of a large Tree, and there gave free Cour&s;e to his Complaints, not imagining that he &s;hould be overheard, in a Place which &s;eemed to him, to be only a &s;it Rece&s;s for Wretches like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to determine which was mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed, the Counte&s;s or her Brother-in-law. This young Lord had till then been ab&s;olute|ly ignorant of the Chevalier's Pa&s;&s;ion for his Si&s;ter, and if &s;ome &s;light Su&s;picions of it had forced their Way into the Mind of the Coun|te&s;s, her Virtue never &s;uffered her Thoughts to re&s;t a Moment upon them. Although her Innocence was fully proved by the Com|plaints her Lover had uttered, yet &s;he was under great Unea&s;ine&s;s at what had happened. Young, innocent, and unexperienced, &s;he knew not what Conduct to ob&s;erve on &s;o cri|tical an Occa&s;ion. She could not determine, whether it was mo&s;t eligible to recommend Secre&s;y to her Brother-in-law, or to de&s;ire him to reveal to her Hu&s;band what he had heard; whether &s;he ought to conceal an Af|fair of &s;uch Con&s;equence from the Count, or tell him her&s;elf what he might po&s;&s;ibly learn one Day from his Brother. After &s;ome Mo|ments Reflexion, &s;he believed the Danger equally great, whether &s;he was &s;ilent, or di&s;|clo&s;ed the Secret, and therefore took a Re|&s;olution upon the Spot, not only to &s;ay no|thing to her Hu&s;band, but al&s;o to di&s;&s;emble
<PB N="16" REF="17">
her Knowledge of it even to her Brother-in-law: accordingly &s;he pur&s;ued her Way to the Ca&s;tle in a profound Silence, and &s;eemed to have under&s;tood nothing of what &s;he had heard.</P>
<P>But &s;he could not impo&s;e upon the young <HI>Berci</HI> he ea&s;ily penetrated into her Thoughts, and knew how to account for her Perplexity. He did not love the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI>; the great Friend&s;hip his Brother expre&s;t for him excited his Jealou&s;y, and he &s;ecretly congratu|lated him&s;elf at fir&s;t, that Fortune had fur|ni&s;hed him with a favourable Opportunity to ruin him for ever with his Brother. But the&s;e were the fir&s;t Motions of his Mind: his na|tural Genero&s;ity prevailed over his Pa&s;&s;ions, and he rejected with Shame the ba&s;e Thoughts which had involuntarily obtruded them&s;elves upon him.</P>
<P>He was apprehen&s;ive likewi&s;e, that if his Brother &s;hould be made acquainted with the Sentiments which the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars</HI> had avowed, it might rai&s;e Su&s;picions injurious to the Honour of his Wife, and change that tender Love he had hitherto felt for her, and that Confidence he had repo&s;ed in her Fidelity, into Indifference and Di&s;tru&s;t. The young Chevalier <HI>de Berci</HI> had a great E&s;teem for his Si&s;ter-in-law; he trembled at the Thoughts of kindling the Flame of Di&s;cord between her and her Hu&s;band; and he loved his Brother too tenderly to in&s;pire him with a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o cruel and tormenting as Jealou|&s;y.
<PB N="17" REF="18">
All the&s;e Con&s;iderations determined him to be &s;ilent with re&s;pect to what had hap|pened: but ob&s;erving that the Counte&s;s con|tinued &s;ilent and pen&s;ive, he &s;poke to her thus:
<Q>I am no longer &s;urpri&s;ed, Madam, at the terrible Melancholy in which the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> is plunged: he is in Love, and you are the Object of his Pa&s;&s;ion. And I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s that the extreme Indifference you di&s;cover for this unhappy Man a&s;toni&s;hes me.</Q></P>
<P>'Methinks,' replied the Counte&s;s with &s;ome Emotion,
<Q>you are not le&s;s indi&s;creet than the Per&s;on you &s;peak of. If it be true, that I am the Object of his Pa&s;|&s;ion, as you tell me, it is no le&s;s true that the Conque&s;t, far from flattering my Vanity, gives me on the contrary great Unea&s;ine&s;s. But that we may no longer have Occa&s;ion to talk of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> and his pre&s;umptuous De&s;igns, for which I am truly afflicted, I conjure you by our mutual Friend&s;hip to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in finding out the Means of procuring his De|parture from <HI>Beauplan</HI>; there is nothing I wi&s;h with more Ardour than to be freed from his Pre&s;ence, that I may receive no farther Proof of that Extravagance you at|tribute to him. My Virtue is alarmed by the bare Po&s;&s;ibility that I may be &s;u&s;pec|ted of giving the lea&s;t Encouragement to his unhappy Pa&s;&s;ion; and my Honour is &s;en&s;ibly wounded by being the involuntaly Object of it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19"><Q>I am very much concerned, Madam, replied the young <HI>Berci,</HI> that I cannot do you the Service you require of me. If I undertake to remove the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> from <HI>Beauplan,</HI> he may po&s;&s;i|bly complain of my Proceedings to my Brother, who will doubtle&s;s in&s;i&s;t upon knowing my Rea&s;ons for thus treating a Man who is &s;o dear to him; how then &s;hall I avoid di&s;clo&s;ing a Secret which for many Rea&s;ons it is not fit he &s;hould be acquainted with? However, if you &s;hall judge it pro|per to write a Letter to the Chevalier &s;uch as your own Prudence &s;hall dictate to you, I will very willingly take upon my&s;elf the Care of getting it &s;afely delivered to him; and I am per&s;uaded that honouring you &s;o much as he does, and &s;eeing that his Pa&s;|&s;ion is both di&s;covered and contemned, he will take a Re&s;olution to bani&s;h him&s;elf voluntarily from your Pre&s;ence, rather than interrupt your Quiet, and the Happine&s;s of your Family.</Q></P>
<P>This Expedient was approved by the Counte&s;s, and &s;he re&s;olved to put it in Execu|tion that very Night. They arrived at the Ca&s;tle without meeting any one; but the Hun|ters were not long after them. They entered with joyful Acclamations, having taken in that Day's Sport a mon&s;trous Stag. The Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was the la&s;t that returned home; they did not fail to railly him upon his leaving them; he got off by &s;aying that he had lo&s;t his Way, and had not been able to re|join
<PB N="19" REF="20">
the Company. Little did he then imagine that the Complaints he had uttered in the Fo|re&s;t at <HI>Beauplan</HI> had reached the Ears of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;he was forming &s;uch cruel Re&s;olutions again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> who&s;e Mind was in great Agitation retired to her Apartment &s;ooner than u&s;ual, and giving Orders to her Attendants that no one &s;hould interrupt her, &s;he &s;hut her&s;elf up in her Clo&s;et, and aban|doned her&s;elf to her Reflexions. The Ad|venture of the Fore&s;t, &s;o dangerous to her Re|putation, &s;o injurious to her Virtue, filled her with Inquietude. She dreaded the fatal Con&s;e|quences that might re&s;ult from it; &s;he reproa|ched her own innocent Self for being the Ob|ject of &s;o criminal a Pur&s;uit, and dete&s;ted tho&s;e Charms which had been capable of in&s;piring Wi&s;hes, and of &s;ugge&s;ting Hopes de&s;tructive to her Fame: a Torrent of Tears ran from her fine Eyes, and wet that beautiful Brea&s;t which was afflicting it&s;elf for the Crimes of others, not her own.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he became a little more compo&s;ed, and began to write: after many times altering, effacing, and writing anew, &s;he at length fini&s;h|ed a Letter, and &s;ending for her Brother-in-law, &s;he delivered it to him, intreating him to di&s;|po&s;e it in &s;uch a Manner that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> might find it that Night in his Chamber, without his being able to gue&s;s how it came there. She recommended it to him in a par|ticular Manner that in copying this anonimous
<PB N="20" REF="21">
Letter he &s;hould carefully di&s;gui&s;e his Hand, for &s;he apprehended &s;ome dangerous Con&s;e|quences might en&s;ue, if the Chevalier di&s;co|vered that it was the young <HI>Berci,</HI> who had written the Letter.</P>
<P>Every Thing was done with as much Expedi|tion and Secre&s;y as &s;he could have wi&s;hed. Sup|per being &s;erved, the Counte&s;s left her Chamber and &s;eated her&s;elf at Table: the whole Compa|ny, except the Chevalier and the Counte&s;s, was chearful and &s;upped with a good Appetite. How|ever they a&s;&s;umed as much Gaiety as po&s;&s;ible, and both carefully di&s;&s;embled the unea&s;y Thoughts which agitated their Souls. The Counte&s;s ta&s;ted by Anticipation the good Effects her Letter was likely to produce, and the Cheva|lier, ignorant of the new Torments that For|tune was preparing for him, regretted his not having made U&s;e of the favourable Oppor|tunity which the Count's Ab&s;ence had afforded him to declare his Pa&s;&s;ion; and was re&s;olved not to defer opening his whole Heart to the Counte&s;s any longer than the next Day, if he &s;hould be &s;o happy to find her alone.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Company broke up, the Count as u&s;ual attended the Chevalier to his Apartment, where after di&s;cour&s;ing with him &s;ome Time upon indifferent Matters, he retired and left him with his Servants, whom the Chevalier di&s;mi&s;&s;ing when he was undre&s;t, approached his Bed and then found the fatal Letter, which was conceived in the&s;e Words:
<Q>Fly from this ho&s;pitable Hou&s;e, which thou ha&s;t vio|lated
<PB N="21" REF="22">
with thy impure De&s;igns? Fly, ra&s;h and pre&s;umptuous Man! Heaven has per|mitted thy impious Thoughts to be di&s;|clo&s;ed, which thou had&s;t vainly imagined were hid in the inmo&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of thy Heart; and out of the Depth of a va&s;t Fo|re&s;t, amid&s;t the Shades of an eternal Night, has brought thy Crime into open Day. Unworthy as thou art of the Name of a Gentleman, thou ha&s;t plotted the Di&s;ho|nour of the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> thy Friend: and not &s;atisfied with having formed De|&s;igns again&s;t the Innocence of his Wife, thou ha&s;t the Audacity to re&s;olve upon con|fe&s;&s;ing thy Pa&s;&s;ion to her, a Pa&s;&s;ion as odious as it is criminal. Thy Death had been al|ready the Puni&s;hment for thy Crime, if thy injured Friend and his Wife, both equally outraged, had been made acquainted with thy Purpo&s;e: But if Heaven has permitted that they &s;hould be &s;till ignorant of it, it is becau&s;e thou &s;hould&s;t have Time to reflect upon the Horror of thy Enterpri&s;e. Fly then in&s;tantly from a Place where, if thou &s;hould&s;t happen to be di&s;covered, nothing could pre&s;erve thee from the Fury of their ju&s;t Revenge.</Q></P>
<P>What a cruel Stroke was this to a tender Lover, to have all his Hopes bla&s;ted in a Moment, and deprived for ever of the Sight of her who was dearer to him than Life. Pale, trembling, and overwhelmed with the deepe&s;t De&s;pair, he remained for a long Time motionle&s;s, with his Eyes fixed on the fatal
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Letter which he &s;till held in his Hand. He could not comprehend by whom it had been written with &s;uch an Appearance of My&s;tery, but he knew that he was di&s;covered, and that the Complaints he had made that Day in the Fore&s;t had been overheard. Oppre&s;t with Grief, he threw him&s;elf upon his Bed, but Sleep was a &s;tranger to his Eyes. In vain he endeavoured to gue&s;s the Author of this cruel Letter, the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> he knew, had not quitted the Cha&s;e, and it was not pro|bable that that Nobleman would, on an Oc|ca&s;ion wherein his Honour was &s;o deeply concerned, have contented him&s;elf with writing in &s;uch a Manner. Neither was it likely that the Counte&s;s was the Author of it: He was entirely ignorant of her having been in the Fore&s;t, and, be&s;ides, the Letter declared that &s;he as well as her Hu&s;band had no Su&s;|picion of his Love and his Schemes. It was probable, therefore, that this anonymous Let|ter had been written by the Count of <HI>Berci</HI>'s Brother, who had not been of the Party for Hunting. The Chevalier had on many Oc|ca&s;ions perceived that this young Lord was not his Friend; but he could not per&s;uade him|&s;elf that a Youth like him, &s;timulated by Hatred, would have been capable of acting with &s;o much Prudence and Moderation in an Affair which furni&s;hed him with an Opportunity of ruining him with the Count his Brother.</P>
<P>The more he reflected upon this Letter, the greater Uncertainty he found him&s;elf in, and the more his Trouble increa&s;ed.
<PB N="23" REF="24">
But mi&s;erable as he knew he &s;hould be, when deprived of the Sight of his dear Counte&s;s, yet he re&s;olved to quit the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan</HI> immediately: he was convinced, that &s;ince his Pa&s;&s;ion was di&s;covered by &s;ome one in the Family, he could not &s;tay longer without ex|po&s;ing the Honour of Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> to Su&s;picion, and that the perpetual Re&s;traint he &s;hould be obliged to lay upon him&s;elf, would &s;ubject him to new Torments. His Thoughts now were wholly employed upon the Means of departing without giving Umbrage to the Count; and how to procure a Mo|ment's Conver&s;ation with the Counte&s;s, the Hope of which was the only Con&s;olation he had in the mi&s;erable Condition to which he was reduced.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Day appeared, he went him&s;elf and wakened one of his Footmen, ordering him to prepare to &s;et out for <HI>Fontainebleau</HI> with the utmo&s;t Expedition; he then wrote a Letter to one of his mo&s;t intimate Friends at Court, intreating him to &s;end him an An|&s;wer after the Model he pre&s;cribed to him. He then directed his Footman to give this Letter into his Friend's own Hands, and to bring him his An&s;wer with the utmo&s;t Di&s;|patch. The Servant returned early the next Morning from <HI>Fontainbleau</HI> with the reque&s;ted Letter, in which the Chevalier's Friend in|formed him that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould come to Court as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for Rea|&s;ons of great Importance, which he could not confide to any one but him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">In the mean Time the Chevalier wa&s;ted all his Moments in contriving Expedients to pro|cure an Interview with the Counte&s;s, but none of them &s;ucceeded: &s;he avoided him &s;o carefully, and with &s;uch apparent De&s;ign, that he was convinced &s;he not only had di&s;|covered his Pa&s;&s;ion, but was likewi&s;e the Author of that Letter, which had &s;o greatly alarmed him. Finding all his Endeavours to &s;peak to the Counte&s;s ineffectual, he went to the Count's Apartment, where, as his good Fortune would have it, he al&s;o found the Counte&s;s his Wife. He &s;hewed Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI> the Letter he had received from his Friend, and intreated him not to be offended, that for &s;ome Time he &s;hould be obliged to deprive him&s;elf of the Plea&s;ure of his Society. The Count, who tenderly loved the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> was greatly afflicted at this News.
<Q>You cannot, &s;ure, &s;aid he, be &s;o much hur|ried as to hinder you from giving us at lea&s;t the Remainder of this Day, to prepare for the Grief we &s;hall &s;uffer by lo&s;ing you; be|&s;ides, I have my&s;elf received &s;ome News from Court, which I want to communicate to you, and to have your Advice upon.</Q>
Saying this, the Count quitted the Room immediately, without waiting for the Cheva|lier's An&s;wer; for the Expre&s;s that had brought him Letters from <HI>Paris</HI> attended his Orders; and by thus leaving him alone with his Wife, he him&s;elf contributed to &s;atisfy the Wi&s;hes of this too tender and unfortunate Lover.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">The Counte&s;s, &s;eeing her Hu&s;band leave the Room, was preparing to follow him, excu|&s;ing her&s;elf to the Chevalier on Account of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Orders &s;he had to give; but the Chevalier, well knowing the Value of an Opportunity which he might probably never meet with again, &s;topt her with a re&s;pectful Air, and beholding her with Eyes in which the Di&s;order of his Soul was but too vi&s;ible,
<Q>Ah do not fly, Madam, &s;aid he with a trem|bling Voice, grant me one Moment's Audi|ence. I have ju&s;t acquainted the Count with the News that has been brought me from Court, but I have received others al&s;o from a Per&s;on who is extremely dear to me. I conjure you, Madam, do not refu&s;e me the Favour of reading this Letter, it will not de|tain you long.</Q>
Saying the&s;e Words he pre|&s;ented her with the Billet, which he &s;u&s;pected &s;he had wrote to him, and fixing his Eyes at the &s;ame Time attentively upon her Face, the Counte&s;s, who in an In&s;tant perceived the Snare he had laid for her, could not con&s;train her&s;elf &s;o far as to conceal her ju&s;t Indignation from the Chevalier.
<Q>What Advantage do you expect from your Artifice, Mon&s;ieur, &s;aid &s;he, what have you dared to hope from this Temerity? Can you imagine that I will &s;uffer you to remain at <HI>Beauplan</HI> after the Offence you have been guilty of? Be &s;atis|fied with my Moderation in not revealing your injurious De&s;igns to my Lord. And take Care that by another Attempt, which may po&s;&s;ibly come to his Knowledge, my Honour may not be wounded by the Sacri|fice

of your Life to his Re&s;entment.</Q>
<Q>Ah! Madam, replied the Chevalier, throwing him&s;elf at her Feet, how unju&s;t, how rigorous are you! I love the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> your Hu&s;band, with the &s;incere&s;t Affection, and I adore you with &s;uch Purity of Sentiments, &s;uch inviolable Re&s;pect, that I cannot think either of you ought to be offended at my Pa&s;&s;ion. It is indeed true, Madam, that what I concealed from you, through Fear of your Re&s;entment, I freely uttered to the Trees amid&s;t the Gloomine&s;s of a Fore&s;t that &s;eemed &s;acred to Solitude and Grief. There it was that I indulged my Sorrow by Complaints, which I had not the Temerity to wi&s;h, might come to your Ear: But &s;ince, contrary to my In|tentions, you have heard them, &s;uffer me to confe&s;s, Madam, that if it is a Crime to love an amiable Object with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful Pa&s;&s;ion, I am the mo&s;t guilty Man in the World. Nay, more, while I confe&s;s &s;o freely this Crime, if it be one, I likewi&s;e prote&s;t that I can never repent of it. Ah! Madam, how u&s;ele&s;s are your Threats again&s;t my Life? I would only pre&s;erve it for your Service, and I cannot &s;acrifice it more nobly than to my Love for you. But your Honour requires that I &s;hould deprive my&s;elf of the only Con&s;ola|tion my unhappy De&s;tiny affords me, I mu&s;t live without &s;eeing you, that your Quiet may not be di&s;turbed, nor your Re|putation injured. Ah! what would not &s;uch Motives prevail upon me to do? Yes,

<P>This Speech, uttered with tho&s;e in&s;inuat|ing Charms which always accompany the Di&s;cour&s;e of a Lover, tender, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and unhappy, made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on the Brea&s;t of the Counte&s;s; but the more &s;he felt her|&s;elf moved by Words &s;o well calculated to &s;educe her, the more &s;he guarded her&s;elf again&s;t their dangerous Softne&s;s, by reflecting upon what &s;he owed to her own Honour, and her Hu&s;band's Tenderne&s;s for her. She turned away her Eyes, that &s;he might not meet tho&s;e of the Chevalier, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate Glances died her Cheeks with Blu&s;hes, and gave her a Confu&s;ion &s;he wi&s;hed him not to be &s;en&s;ible of. A&s;&s;uming, therefore, a calm and &s;erene Air, &s;he an&s;wered him thus:</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"><Q>You ought to know my Character well, Mon&s;ieur, and to believe that my Know|ledge of your Merit would make me think the Pa&s;&s;ion you avow for me an Honour, were I at Liberty to accept of it. As I am, it is injurious to my Virtue and my Fame, both which ought to be dear to you if you have really any Tenderne&s;s for me. You ought to be &s;atisfied with the E&s;teem your Merit has in&s;pired me with, &s;ince it is all my Virtue will allow of, and never hope that I &s;hall be capable of entertaining any other Sentiments. Pur&s;ue then, Mon&s;ieur, the Re&s;olution you have taken to leave <HI>Beauplan,</HI> which will appear the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, when you &s;hall know that young <HI>Berci</HI> was with me in the Fore&s;t when you indulged tho&s;e imprudent Complaints; he will doubtle&s;s watch your Conduct &s;trictly; every thing will appear of Con|&s;equence to an intere&s;ted Ob&s;erver. He is jealous of the Friend&s;hip his Brother bears you, he may do you bad Offices with him; at lea&s;t he may di&s;clo&s;e your Secret: young Men, though generous, are not always di&s;|crete.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s had but ju&s;t ended the&s;e Words, when the Count entered the Chamber with his Brother. The Chevalier was griev|ed that their Conver&s;ation was interrupted, and both he and the Counte&s;s were apprehen|&s;ive that the young Lord had di&s;covered their Secret. However their Su&s;picions were &s;oon removed. The Count taking the Chevalier
<PB N="29" REF="30">
a&s;ide, di&s;covered his own Affairs to him, with &s;uch unlimited Confidence, that he was per&s;uaded he was intirely ignorant of his. Whil&s;t they were engaged in this private Conference, the Counte&s;s acquainted her Brother-in-law with the Succe&s;s of her Billet. She told him that the Chevalier had re&s;olved to quit <HI>Beauplan</HI> immediately; but &s;he took no Notice of his having mentioned his Love to her, or that he knew the Billet he had found came from her.</P>
<P>The Chevalier felt &s;ome Alleviation of his Sorrows by the Confe&s;&s;ion he had made to the Counte&s;s. She had indeed given him no Hopes, but &s;he had li&s;tened to him without Anger. He appeared le&s;s melancholly than u&s;ual the re&s;t of that Day, and pa&s;&s;ed the Night, if not in Tranquility, yet free from the dreadful Inquietude which his Doubts about that fatal Letter had occa&s;ioned. The next Day, after taking a tender Leave of the Count and Counte&s;s, he &s;et out for the Court. His Mind being wholly employed upon the Gentlene&s;s and Moderation with which Ma|dam <HI>de Berci</HI> had li&s;tened to the Confe&s;&s;ion he made her of his Pa&s;&s;ion, he rode with great Swiftne&s;s, contrary to the general Practice of Lovers, who move &s;lowly and with Regret from the Place where they have left the Object of their Tenderne&s;s; and fortu|nately as it proved for him, he arrived before Night at the Entrance of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">Scarce had he rode a few Paces in it, when, by the Report of &s;ome Pi&s;tols that were fired, and the Cries that reached his Ears, he judged that &s;ome Per&s;ons were attacked by Robbers in that Wood, and that they were not at any great Di&s;tance. All the Attendants he had with him, were a Valet de Chambre, and two Footmen; but had he been alone, he had too much Courage to have gone back. He rode on then with an Intrepidity natural to him, and directing his Cour&s;e to the Place from whence the Noi&s;e proceeded, he &s;aw a &s;ingle Man environed by ten Robbers, who were upon the Point of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating him. The&s;e Wretches had already killed two of his Attendants, and di&s;per&s;ed three others who &s;ought their Safety in Flight. The Man that was left, defended him&s;elf de&s;perately, and knowing that he could not e&s;cape Death, he re&s;olved to &s;ell his Life dear. He had al|ready got rid of two of the Robbers with his Pi&s;tols, and &s;upporting him&s;elf again&s;t the Trunk of a large Tree, he parried with his Sword, as well as he could, the Strokes that the&s;e Villains aimed at him.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> tran&s;ported with Rage at this Sight, fired his Pi&s;tols at the Robbers and did &s;ome Execution; he afterwards ru&s;hed in among them, being mounted upon a vigor|ous Hor&s;e, and pierced with his Sword all who oppo&s;ed his Pa&s;&s;age. His Pi&s;tols laid two of the&s;e A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins upon the Earth; his Hor&s;e threw down another, who fell at his Feet, and his Sword delivered him from a fourth.

The re&s;t of the&s;e wicked Wretches, &s;eeing the Ground covered with their dead and wounded Comrades, were &s;eized with Terror, and believing the whole Marecha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was at their Heels, they di&s;appeared in an In&s;tant, and took Shelter in the deepe&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of the Fore&s;t, leaving the Field of Battle free to the intrepid Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI></P>
<P>After this bloody Combat, he approached the Gentleman whom he had relieved, and was charmed to &s;ee in a Per&s;on, who&s;e white Hairs &s;hewed that he was full of Years, all the Fire and Activity of Youth. He was &s;truck with a reverential Awe at the Maje&s;ty which appeared in his Counte|nance, and &s;aluting him in a mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful Manner, enquired if he was wounded, and offered him his be&s;t Services.
<Q>Generous Unknown, replied the old Gentleman, my Wounds, I believe, are but incon&s;iderable: to your Valour and the &s;peedy Relief you brought me, I owe the Pre&s;ervation of my Life; but I am very much concerned for the Lo&s;s of my Servants, who are all either dead, or di&s;per&s;ed.</Q>
<Q>As for the former, replied the Chevalier, they have died like Men of Honour; the others, who &s;o ba&s;e|ly abandoned you, are not worthy of your Cares; neverthele&s;s they are &s;o near the Court, whither I &s;uppo&s;e your Journey was to terminate, that they cannot be in any Danger.</Q>
<Q>I was indeed going to Court, an&s;wered the old Gentleman; but I did not de&s;ign to continue there any con&s;idera|ble

Time. It is long &s;ince my Age and the Charms of a Country Life have forced me from that honourable Captivity. But, Mon&s;ieur, let us, I conjure you, &s;ee whe|ther the&s;e two faithful Servants, whom with Grief I &s;aw fall in my Defence, have any Occa&s;ion for our A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q>
The Che|valier's Servants had already alighted, and were bu&s;y about the two Men who they found &s;till breathed, although they were dangerou&s;ly wounded in many Places. With great Dif|ficulty they re&s;tored them to their Sen&s;es; and then hollowing to the re&s;t of the old Gentle|man's Servants who had fled, their Voices, favoured by the Silence of the Night, re|&s;ounded through the Fore&s;t, and reached the Ears of tho&s;e terrified Men, who hearing them&s;elves called by their Names, began to lo&s;e Part of their Fears, and they returned to their Ma&s;ter, whom they could not behold without Confu&s;ion. After having bound up his Wounds, they applied them&s;elves to re|lieve their Comrades, who were in much greater Danger, and &s;eating them upon Hor&s;es they mounted behind and &s;upported them; and in this Manner pur&s;ued the Road to <HI>Fon|tainebleau.</HI></P>
<P>During this Journey, the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the old Gentleman, and apologi&s;ing for his Curio&s;ity, intreated him to let him know who it was he had had the good Fortune to a&s;&s;i&s;t.
<Q>I am too much obliged to your Valour, Mon&s;ieur, replied the old Gentleman, not to &s;eize eagerly
<PB N="33" REF="34">
this Occa&s;ion of gratifying your Wi&s;hes. I will not only tell you my Name and Qua|lity, but I will give you an Account of my Adventures. The Life which you have &s;o lately pre&s;erved, is a Benefit I hold from your Genero&s;ity and all the Moments, which for the future I &s;hall enjoy, ought to be devoted to you. Happy, if the grate|ful Sen&s;e I have of what you have done for me, will not be unacceptable; but happier &s;till, if Fortune will be favourable to my mo&s;t ardent Wi&s;hes, and afford me the Means of &s;erving you, and of giving you &s;ome &s;triking Proof of my Gratitude.</Q>
The Chevalier returned An&s;wers full of Re|&s;pect to the&s;e obliging Expre&s;&s;ions, and in|treated the old Gentleman to begin his Reci|tal, and give him a more perfect Knowledge of a Per&s;on for whom he already felt &s;o much E&s;teem. Accordingly the old Gentleman be|gan thus:</P>
<P><Q>I was born in the Province of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> I am called the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> great Part of my Life has been &s;pent in the Field, in the Service of my Country and Religion, and there have been few memo|rable Actions that have pa&s;t in my Time, which I have not been a Witne&s;s of. I was wounded in that fatal Battle, in which <HI>Don John of Au&s;tria</HI> and the <HI>Venetians</HI> died the Sea of the <HI>Levant</HI> with <HI>Ottoman</HI> Blood. After having &s;erved a long Time in foreign Countries, I returned to <HI>France,</HI> I made my la&s;t Campaigns in tho&s;e fatal Civil Wars,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
where Citizens, blinded by a fal&s;e Zeal, dipped their impious Hands in the Blood of their Fellow-Citizens, and thought it for the Glory of Religion to attack the Lives of their Countrymen with a &s;avage Fury. Deplorable Times, when the Subject thought he was doing an acceptable Service in&s;o|lently to take up Arms again&s;t his lawful King.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;peaking, Mon&s;ieur, of the la&s;t Re|bellions in <HI>France</HI> again&s;t that generous Monarch, &s;o dear at pre&s;ent to the very People, who once &s;o eagerly oppo&s;ed him: A Prince who&s;e Goodne&s;s, Courage and Glory, will live eternally in the Annals of our Hi&s;tory. I had the Honour to fight near him in the celebrated Battle of <HI>Ivry,</HI> the Event of which, was to &s;eat him upon the Throne, or to exclude him from it for ever. His Forces were greatly inferiour to tho&s;e of his Enemies; but <HI>Henry,</HI> who&s;e Per&s;on alone was worth a whole Army, formed him&s;elf the Plan of the Battle, was pre&s;ent in every Part, animated all, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf like a common Soldier to every Danger. Before he ordered the Sig|nal to be given for &s;ounding the Charge, he &s;poke the&s;e few Words to his Soldiers, with that maje&s;tick Sweetne&s;s, which gain|ed him every Heart. <HI>Friends,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you are French Men, I am your King, and there is the Enemy.</HI> This noble and Iaconick Speech in&s;pired us with Courage and ex|cited a general Emulation. We gained a
<PB N="35" REF="36">
complete Victory, which was followed by many other great Advantages. The Re|duction of <HI>Mante</HI> and <HI>Vernon,</HI> which were brought under the Obedience of their law|ful Sovereign, put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Bridges of the <HI>Seine</HI> that lay between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Rouen.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>We afterwards made our&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all the Towns in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Siege of that great Capital, which was reduced to the la&s;t Extremity, having been rai&s;ed by the King in Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the unhappy <HI>Pari&s;ians,</HI> and fail|ing in our Attempt to get Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by Stratagem, we inve&s;ted and took <HI>Chartres</HI> in a mo&s;t rigorous Sea&s;on. At length this great Prince, who had cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be in&s;tructed in the Principles of the Catho|lick Religion, became &s;en&s;ible of the Errors of his own, and performed his Abjuration at the Abbey of <HI>Saint Dennis</HI> with all the Formalities in u&s;e in &s;uch Ceremonies. From that happy Day, the Party of the League &s;unk in&s;en&s;ibly, and our great Mo|narch, by this wi&s;e and prudent Step, which was neither influenced by Intere&s;t nor Fear, &s;aw him&s;elf in the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Throne, which was his lawful Inheritance, and which he held but from God alone.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e were the la&s;t Campaigns in which I &s;erved. The whole Kingdom, &s;ubmitting to <HI>Henry the Great,</HI> I re&s;olved to make a a Vi&s;it to my paternal E&s;tate. Love was
<PB N="36" REF="37">
the Cau&s;e of my &s;ettling there. I was weary of the tumultuous Life of a Soldier; the calm Plea&s;ures I ta&s;ted in the Country made me de&s;irous of Privacy and Retire|ment, and my Pa&s;&s;ion for Madam <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> whom I happened to &s;ee at the Hou&s;e of a neighbouring Gentleman, whom I went to vi&s;it, confirmed me in my Re&s;o|lution to quit the Court, and to pa&s;s the Remainder of my Life in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> my native Province. I married her: in the Cour&s;e of two Years &s;he brought me a Son and a Daughter. My Son is at pre&s;ent at Court, and my Daughter was married about three Years ago to a Nobleman called the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who is now at a Ca&s;tle of his, half a Day's Journey from hence. I quitted my Retreat to come and vi&s;it my Children, whom I pa&s;&s;ionately longed to &s;ee, and was wholly intent upon the Plea|&s;ure of embracing my dear Son, whom I propo&s;ed to vi&s;it fir&s;t, when at the Entrance of this Fore&s;t I was &s;et upon by a Band of Robbers, and &s;hould have doubtle&s;s lo&s;t my Life by their Hands, but for the &s;ea&s;onable Succour you brought me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Such, Mon&s;ieur, is the Hi&s;tory of my Life and Fortunes, which I have given you in a few Words; but, brave Unknown, added the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> I expect that you will gratify my Impatience to know who has &s;o lately expo&s;ed his Life, yet fre&s;h and blooming, to &s;ave the poor Remains of mine.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was equally &s;ur|prized and plea&s;ed at what he had heard, a &s;ecret Joy took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul, and a hundred Times he ble&s;t his good Fortune, that the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau</HI> had afforded him an Opportunity of &s;aving the Life of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Father. He might have made him|&s;elf known to the Marquis of <HI>Saint-Sauveur,</HI> not only without Danger of any di&s;agreeable Con&s;equence, but al&s;o with an Increa&s;e of Satisfaction to the old Man, who would have been charmed to hear that this Pre&s;erver was the intimate Friend of the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> his Son-in-law: yet through an Exce&s;s of Delicacy, which few would have been capable of, he cho&s;e rather to conceal his Name. He flattered him&s;elf, that when the Counte&s;s &s;hould know that the Life of her Father had been pre&s;erved by him, and that by conceal|ing his Name he gave a convincing Proof that he &s;ought not any Acknowledgement from her for &s;uch a Service, &s;he would be as much plea&s;ed with his Di&s;cretion and Mode&s;ty, as with his Courage.</P>
<P>Having taken his Re&s;olution, therefore, he an&s;wered the old Marquis in this Manner:
<Q>I am but a private Man, Mon&s;ieur, and &s;o little known in the World, that if I &s;hould tell you my Name, you would know it no better than you do my Per&s;on. I have only the Honour to inform you, that this Day I pa&s;&s;ed by the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> where the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> is at pre&s;ent. I heard that he was in good Health, as is
<PB N="38" REF="39">
likewi&s;e the Counte&s;s your Daughter; and the high Reputation they have among all the neighbouring Gentry, for their many great and amiable Virtues, makes me think my&s;elf happy to have &s;erved them in the Per&s;on of a Gentleman of your Rank, and &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to them.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier's Precaution was of no U&s;e to him; his Valet de Chambre, who knew not that his Ma&s;ter had any Rea&s;ons for con|cealing his Name, had di&s;covered it before to one of the Marquis's Attendants: but when he found by his Ma&s;ter's Di&s;cour&s;e, that he had a De&s;ign to keep him&s;elf unknown, he was concerned at what he had done, and in|treated the Servant to whom he had been &s;o communicative, not to repeat what he had &s;aid. In the mean Time the Marquis and the Chevalier continued their Journey to <HI>Fontaine|bleau,</HI> during which the Marquis had often, but in vain, urged his Pre&s;erver to di&s;clo&s;e his Name and Condition.</P>
<P>The Court was &s;o full, that no Lodgings could be procured, except one Apartment, which the Chevalier obliged the Marquis to accommodate him&s;elf with, and he went to the Hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> his Friend. This young Lord gave him a mo&s;t obliging Reception, and the Chevalier as &s;oon as they &s;at down to Supper, relating the Adventures which had happened to the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> a&s;ked him, if he knew the
<PB N="39" REF="40">
Son of that Marquis who was now at Court.
<Q>I have never &s;een him, replied the Chevalier, but I have heard great Prai&s;es of his Cou|rage.</Q>
<Q>He is one of the brave&s;t young Men in <HI>France,</HI> re&s;umed Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mo|rigny</HI>; we performed our Exerci&s;es together at <HI>Paris,</HI> we were hardly ever a&s;under du|ring our Travels through <HI>Italy,</HI> and till within the&s;e few Days we have lived in the &s;tricte&s;t Intimacy and Friend&s;hip; but there is a great Coldne&s;s between us at pre&s;ent, and I believe it will not be long before we &s;hall break altogether with each other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry for it, an&s;wered the Chevalier, but is it impo&s;&s;ible to effect a Reconcilia|tion between you?</Q>
<Q>It will be a very difficult Thing, returned Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mo|rigny,</HI> &s;ince it is Love that has di&s;united us. We are both enamoured of one Lady, and neither of us are di&s;po&s;ed to yield up our Pretentions. However if he had fir&s;t ad|dre&s;&s;ed the Lady, my Friend&s;hip for him would have induced me to make an Effort to &s;ubdue my Pa&s;&s;ion; but &s;ince I &s;aw, and loved her fir&s;t, I expect he &s;hould make a Sacrifice, &s;uch as I would do in his Situa|tion. I &s;poke to him to this Purpo&s;e this Evening, as we both came away toge|ther from Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> for that is the Name of the young Lady we love. I know not how he received what I &s;aid, but I explained my&s;elf in a Manner &s;ufficiently intelligible, and it is not my Fault if he did not under&s;tand my Meaning.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">The Chevalier was extremely afflicted at this Di&s;cour&s;e; he fore&s;aw that if the&s;e Friends &s;hould have a Duel, during his Stay at <HI>Fon|tainebleau,</HI> he &s;hould be obliged, according to the Rules of that fal&s;e Notion of Honour which then prevailed in <HI>France,</HI> to offer him|&s;elf as a Second to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny.</HI> He was not deceived in his Conjecture, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> was &s;carce awake the next Mor|ning, when a Gentleman de&s;ired Admittance to him, he ordered him to be &s;hewn imme|diately into his Apartment; after the fir&s;t Civilities the Gentleman told him that the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> de&s;ired to &s;ee him immediately with his Sword in his Hand, to give him Satisfaction for the injuri|ous Treatment he had received from him the Evening before: the Gentleman added, that the Marquis had done him the Honour to chu&s;e him for his Second, and therefore he intreated him to fix upon one of his Friends for the &s;ame Service.
<Q>Mon&s;ieur, replied <HI>Morigny,</HI> with great Compo&s;ure, I am ready to give your Friend the Satisfaction he de|mands, but I will have no Second, and I know you are a Man of &s;o much Honour, that upon the Security of your Word, I will go alone to meet my Adver&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I expected &s;uch an An&s;wer from one of your Courage and Genero&s;ity, replied the Gentleman, and in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, I would make &s;uch a one my&s;elf, but you doubtle&s;s know better than I, that Cu&s;tom in this Place gives the Law to Rea&s;on. The
<PB N="41" REF="42">
Bu&s;ine&s;s of Seconds is to be Witne&s;&s;es of the Conduct of their Friends, not to fight them&s;elves; but the contrary has obtained by long U&s;e, and you and I are too young to e&s;tabli&s;h new Laws. I entreat you then, Mon&s;ieur, to employ &s;ome one of your Friends upon this Occa&s;ion, or permit me to tell the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> that you refu&s;e to give him the ordinary Means of Satisfaction.</Q></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> was going to make the Gentleman &s;ome An&s;wer when the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> &s;uddenly entered the Room; he had heard that &s;ome Per&s;on had enquired for Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> and judging by the Di&s;cour&s;e he had with him the Evening before, that the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> would in|fallibly &s;end a Challenge the next Morning, he ro&s;e ha&s;tily, and wrapping his Nightgown about him, &s;lipped into a Place from whence he could overhear their Conver&s;ation. He ru&s;hed into the Room upon hearing the Gen|tleman &s;ay the&s;e la&s;t Words:
<Q>What is the Matter, Gentlemen, &s;aid he? you &s;eem to be di&s;puting &s;ome Point, is there no way to bring you to an Accommodation. I have thought, added he without giving them Time to reply, of an Expedient to put an End to your Conte&s;t, for I &s;u&s;pect the De|&s;ign, Mon&s;ieur, that brought you here. I declare then that if Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> will not accept the Challenge with the Con|ditions you bring him, I offer to take it up|on my&s;elf, and will attend your Call when|ever
<PB N="42" REF="43">
you plea&s;e.</Q>
<Q>You are too generous, my dear Chevalier, &s;aid Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mo|rigny,</HI> embracing him; and &s;ince you will have it &s;o, let us dre&s;s our&s;elves in&s;tantly, and meet the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> at the Place appointed.</Q></P>
<P>It was with infinite Pain and Regret, that the Chevalier took this Step: no Quarrel of his own had ever given him &s;o much Unea&s;i|ne&s;s. He was under terrible Apprehen&s;ions that by it he &s;hould ruin him&s;elf with the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> his Friend. He was preparing to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> again&s;t the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> at the Hazard of all the fatal Con&s;equences that might re&s;ult from this Combat. But the&s;e Con&s;iderations were weak, compared to that of incurring the Di&s;plea&s;ure of his dear Counte&s;s. He had Rea&s;on to expect that &s;he would be highly in|cen&s;ed again&s;t him; yet terrible as this Thought was, that Notion of fal&s;e Honour, to which the brave&s;t Men were Slaves at that Time, made him re&s;olve, at the Expence of all that was dear to him, to comply with it. Unju&s;t and cruel Law, which rea&s;onable Men im|po&s;ed upon them&s;elves! Tho&s;e de&s;tructive Maxims cannot be rejected with too much Horror, nor can their Influence during that mi&s;erable Period be too highly lamented. Every Day teemed with the Fates of &s;ome brave Youths, who wantonly &s;acrificed each other's Lives in &s;upport of a Quarrel wherein they had no Part, and which they had heard
<PB N="43" REF="44">
of but a few Moments before. This Mad|ne&s;s they carried &s;till farther: a Man would have thought him&s;elf injured, and have pub|lickly complained of the Inju&s;tice that was done him, if on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion his Friend had not made choice of him for his Second; and if it happened that he was informed of the Di&s;pute, he would with the utmo&s;t Eagerne&s;s run to offer his Arm to revenge the often imaginary Wrong. It very frequently hap|pened, that the Adver&s;ary to whom he was to be oppo&s;ed, was one of his in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mate Friends, yet it would have been di&s;honourable if he had &s;crupled on the&s;e glorious Occa&s;ions to have deprived him of Life. We cannot give too many Prai&s;es to that Prince, truly worthy of the Name of Great, who by wi&s;e Edicts, &s;upported by illu&s;trious Examples of a &s;alutary Rigour, at length &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this &s;avage Gal|lantry, which every Day carried off &s;ome of the Flower of his Nobility, and the brave&s;t Men in his Kingdom. But let us re&s;ume the Thread of our Hi&s;tory, and &s;ee what pa&s;&s;ed at the Hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was determined there, that they &s;hould fight two again&s;t two, the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> dre&s;t them&s;elves in ha&s;te, and were conducted by the Gentleman into one of the mo&s;t private Parts of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> where they found the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur</HI> waiting for them on Hor&s;eback. They all di&s;mounted in an In&s;tant, and &s;tripping them&s;elves to their Shirts, the Chevalier <HI>des
<PB N="44" REF="45" MS="y">
E&s;&s;ars</HI> and the Gentleman left the young Mar|quis <HI>de Saint Sauveur,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mo|rigny</HI> to terminate their real Di&s;pute, while they went to put an End to their imaginary one. However they a&s;&s;aulted each other with no le&s;s Fury than the two others, and after both had made &s;everal Pa&s;&s;es without Succe&s;s, they clo&s;ed and each received a Wound from his Adver&s;ary. The Chevalier pa&s;&s;ed his Sword through the Gentleman's right Thigh, and was him&s;elf wounded at the &s;ame Time in the left Arm. The Gentleman no longer able to &s;tand fell upon the Ground, and the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> too generous to take Advantage of his good Fortune, and having not the lea&s;t De&s;ign to terminate by the Death of his Adver&s;ary the Combat which was now become unequal, &s;poke to him in the&s;e Terms:</P>
<P><Q>Let us put an End, Mon&s;ieur, to a Di&s;|pute which began on our Friend's Account, we have no Rea&s;on to hate each other. Take my Advice, let us content our&s;elves with the Blood we have mutually &s;hed, and do you permit me to go and endeavour to &s;eparate two Men, whom a Trifle has made Enemies.</Q></P>
<P>He quitted the Gentleman that In&s;tant, without waiting for his An&s;wer, and ran eagerly to the two Rivals, who had both given and received &s;everal Wounds. But in the Moment as he was advancing towards them, the Sword of the young Marquis by
<PB N="45" REF="46">
a Stroke of his Enemy's broke in the Middle. The unfortunate Youth &s;eeing the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> approach alone with his Sword drawn and bloody, did not doubt but that he had killed his Friend and was come to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny.</HI> But not &s;uffering the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions to appear, he redoubled his Efforts, although he had now nothing but a broken Sword to defend him|&s;elf with, and re&s;olved to &s;ell his Life dearly. But the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> throwing him|&s;elf between the Combatants, intreated them to &s;top a Moment and li&s;ten to him.</P>
<P><Q>You are both brave, &s;aid he, neither has had any Advantage over the other, but what Chance, not &s;uperiour Skill or Strength, has given. I therefore conjure you, Gentlemen, to remember your former Friend&s;hip, once &s;o tender and &s;incere, and do not ra&s;hly &s;acrifice it to &s;o &s;light a Difference as yours is. Can you refu&s;e to grant this Favour to two Friends who have &s;o lately expo&s;ed their Lives and &s;hed their Blood for you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, Marquis, &s;aid Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mo|rigny,</HI> will you not now confe&s;s your&s;elf vanqui&s;hed, when with only a broken Sword you have the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> and me al&s;o to oppo&s;e?</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, an&s;wered the brave Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> with a generous Indignation, I am not vanqui&s;hed, do not flatter your&s;elves that you have this Advantage over me, you
<PB N="46" REF="47">
are indeed Ma&s;ters of my Life, Fortune has delivered it into your Hands, but you can|not take my Courage from me, although I am deprived of the Means of defending my&s;elf.</Q>
<Q>Live then, replied Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> charmed with the young Mar|quis's Courage and noble Contempt of Death; live unconquered and invincible: the poor Advantage I have gained, I owe only to Fortune, I claim no Triumph from it; and all I conte&s;t for is, that I may not be overcome in Virtue and Genero&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, my dear <HI>Morigny,</HI> replied the young Marquis, I now acknowledge you have truly vanqui&s;hed me, when with &s;uch Great|ne&s;s of Soul you give me a Life which you might have deprived me of without Shame, and Inju&s;tice, but which my Courage would never have &s;uffered me to a&s;k for. Yes, dear <HI>Morigny,</HI> my Eyes are opened, in thee I no longer behold a Rival, and an Enemy; but &s;ee with Joy a virtuous and magnanimous Friend. My Heart, &s;oftened by thy Genero&s;ity, re&s;igns for ever its Ha|tred and De&s;ire of Revenge. Suffer me then with this tender and &s;incere Embrace to a&s;&s;ure you, that I have the highe&s;t E&s;teem for your Virtues, and the utmo&s;t Gratitude for the Kindne&s;s you have &s;hewn me.</Q>
Saying this he threw away his broken Sword, and ran into the Arms of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny.</HI> They continued a long Time in a &s;trict Em|brace, and reciprocally conjured each other to forget they had ever had any Difference,
<PB N="47" REF="48">
vowing a perpetual Friend&s;hip for the future, which no Con&s;ideration whatever &s;hould have Power to break.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> then en|quiring of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> the Name of his generous Friend, he turned to the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and politely thanked him for the Genero&s;ity he had &s;hewn him, and which he had not merited, intreating him in the mo&s;t obliging Terms, to grant him the Honour of his Friend&s;hip. The Chevalier met the&s;e Advances of the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> with a Politene&s;s full of Mo|de&s;ty and Re&s;pect; he embraced him tenderly, and they both vowed an eternal Friend&s;hp.</P>
<P>Mean Time the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> lo&s;t a great deal of Blood; but the Friend of the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> lo&s;t much more: that Gentleman was &s;o weakened by his Wound, and the great Effu&s;ion of Blood from it, that he had not been able to ri&s;e. They all ran to the Place where the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> had left him, and found him more &s;en&s;ible of his Misfortune in not having been able to follow the Che|valier, than of the Pain of his Wound. But when he was informed of the happy Event of the Combat between his Friend and Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> he congratulated them both with a &s;incere Joy.</P>
<P>The whole Court was already informed of this Duel. The Challenge had not been &s;ent
<PB N="48" REF="49">
with &s;uch Secre&s;y, but Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin,</HI> who was the Occa&s;ion of it, had Notice of it a few Moments afterwards. Several of the young Lords of the Court, to whom &s;he had communicated the Affair, mounted im|mediately to go in Search of the Rivals, and to &s;eparate them: but not knowing the Spot they had cho&s;en to decide their Quarrel, they wandered about a long Time in the Fore&s;t, and did not find them till the Combat was over. The fir&s;t that di&s;covered them were the Friends of the Gentleman who had been wounded in the Thigh: they cau&s;ed a Hand|litter to be made immediately with &s;ome Branches they broke off the Trees, and car|ried him to <HI>Fontainebleau.</HI> The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> earne&s;tly recommended him to the Care of his Attendants, and took Leave of him with great Tenderne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t Concern for his Wound; and then mounting his Hor&s;e, he joined the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ar,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> and they rode all together, after renewing their Pro|te&s;tations of an inviolable Friend&s;hip for the Future. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> and the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> took the Road to <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> that which led to the Ca&s;tle of his Brother-in-law the Count of <HI>Berci</HI>; for their Combat had made it dan|gerous for them to return to <HI>Fontainebleau.</HI></P>
<P>The old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who had ri&s;en very early that Morning to vi&s;it his wounded Servants, was informed by one of his Footman of the Duel fought by his Son,
<PB N="49" REF="50">
which already made a great Noi&s;e at <HI>Fontaine|bleau.</HI> He &s;ent immediately to his Son's Lodgings to be more particularly informed, and his Me&s;&s;enger was told that the young Lord went out very early in the Morning with three other Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback, with an Intention, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, to fight, and that &s;everal of the Courtiers had mounted their Hor&s;es and were gone to &s;eparate them. This News filled the old Man with the mo&s;t dreadful Alarms, he mounted a Hor&s;e that In&s;tant, and galloped after them, and &s;oon met the Men who carried the wounded Gen|tleman; from whom he was informed of the Event of the Combat. The good old Man then returned to <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> and after re|commending his Servants to the Care of the Surgeons, he took the Road to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> whither he did not doubt his Son had retired. His Eagerne&s;s to &s;ee him and be a&s;&s;ured that he was not dangerou&s;ly hurt, made him u&s;e &s;uch Speed, that the young Lord was &s;till in the Embraces of the Count and Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> when he ar|rived.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s and her Brother felt very different Sentiments at the Sight of their Fa|ther, hers was all Joy and Tenderne&s;s, his Surprize and Confu&s;ion. After the old Mar|quis had embraced his Son-in-law and his Daughter, the young Marquis approached to pay his Duty to him, and was received with equal Tenderne&s;s as the others, the good old
<PB N="50" REF="51">
Gentleman &s;eeming not to perceive that he had his Arm in a Scarf; but as &s;oon as they were all &s;eated at Table, the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> ob&s;erved it for the fir&s;t Time:
<Q>Certainly, &s;aid &s;he, you have &s;ome Rea&s;ons which you are unwilling to own for wearing this Scarf. I cannot believe you carry it in Triumph, as a Favour from a Mi&s;tre&s;s, but rather that you are obliged through Nece&s;&s;ity to wear it. I beg you will explain this My&s;tery to me, it has an Appearance that gives me great Inquietude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I own to you, Si&s;ter, replied the young Marquis, that I am obliged to wear this Scarf on Account of a violent Pain I feel in my Arm, but it is not dangerous, there|fore do not be unea&s;y about it.</Q>
<Q>I know Son, &s;aid the old Marquis, that your Arm gives you &s;ome Pain, but pray tell the true Cau&s;e of it to your Si&s;ter. I &s;hall rai&s;e another Quarrel between you and a Gen|tleman I met in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau</HI> to Day, if you relate the Affair differently from what he told it.</Q>
The young Mar|quis blu&s;hed at the&s;e Words, and not doubt|ing but that his Father was fully informed of the whole Affair, he related it to his Brother-in-law and his Si&s;ter very &s;uccinctly, prai&s;ing particularly the Genero&s;ity of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI>'s Second, who, he &s;aid, had &s;aved his Life in the very Moment that his Sword was broken in his Hand; and he owned that he could not have avoided Death, if that brave
<PB N="51" REF="52">
Man had not eagerly thrown him&s;elf between him and his Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>The young Marquis was about to tell the Name of his Deliverer, when he &s;topt through Re&s;pect, perceiving his Father was going to &s;peak.
<Q>Son, &s;aid the old Gentleman, you have to Day had a very narrow E&s;cape, let me advi&s;e you never to tempt an unnece&s;&s;ary Danger, there are Accidents enough which happen in the World, by which the Life of a brave Man may be &s;hortened, there is no Occa&s;ion to &s;eek Death, he comes too often unexpected and unde&s;ired. Your Ra&s;hne&s;s was the Cau&s;e of your Danger this Day, but that which I e&s;caped Ye&s;terday was the meer Effect of ill Fortune. I was attacked in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau</HI> by a Band of Robbers, who wounded two of my mo&s;t faithful Servants, and put the re&s;t to Flight. I could not have avoided &s;inking under their Strokes, but for an A&s;&s;i&s;tance, more than human I think, which was brought me when my Strength had almo&s;t wholly for|&s;aken me; a Gentleman on Hor&s;eback came to my Relief, when I de&s;paired of Safety, he appeared like the avenging Thunder of Heaven, he either overthrew or di&s;per&s;ed all my Enemies in a few Moments. I could not view him plainly becau&s;e it was almo&s;t dark, but he had the Air and Port of a Hero, as well as the Valour and Courage of one, but his Mode&s;ty exceeded every thing I ever met with; I could not help be|ing
<PB N="52" REF="53">
grieved at it, becau&s;e it robbed me of the plea&s;ing Satisfaction of knowing to whom I was obliged for my Life, however he an|&s;wered my Enquiries with Excu&s;es &s;o polite, and with &s;uch a graceful Sweetne&s;s, that I dur&s;t not take the Liberty to pre&s;s him any farther. I thought I &s;hould have failed in Re&s;pect and Gratitude, if I had urged him to reveal a Secret which he doubtle&s;s had Rea&s;ons for concealing from me.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e Words one of the old Marquis's Servants who waited at his Chair, &s;tepping a little forward, &s;aid,
<Q>Mon&s;ieur, the Gentle|man who came to your A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Wood, is called the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> his Valet de Chambre told it me Ye&s;terday, as we pur&s;ued our Journey after the Com|bat: and he added, that he had left this Ca&s;tle the &s;ame Day, but hearing his Ma&s;ter make you Excu&s;es for not telling his Name, he earne&s;tly intreated me not to mention to you what he had told me. I likewi&s;e be|lieve that he is the &s;ame Per&s;on who fought this Morning with the Gentleman we met in the Fore&s;t, for I heard it &s;aid that his Adver&s;ary came to <HI>Fontainebleau</HI> but la&s;t Night.</Q></P>
<P>The young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> was the only Per&s;on pre&s;ent who could clear up a My&s;tery which perplexed every one el&s;e. He accordingly declared that the valiant Man to whom both his Father and him&s;elf owed the
<PB N="53" REF="54">
Pre&s;ervation of their Lives, was the Cheva|lier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> A general A&s;toni&s;hment &s;eiz|ed the Company: all were eager to give the Chevalier's Valour and Mode&s;ty the Prai&s;es &s;o ju&s;tly due. The Satisfaction and Joy which the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> felt at this News was &s;ilent, but not le&s;s &s;incere. She was afraid of indulging her&s;elf in any Expre&s;&s;ions of it, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould give Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion to her Bro|ther-in law. This young Man kept a pro|found Silence, and &s;eemed unwilling to give the Chevalier's Virtues that Tribute of ju&s;t Prai&s;e which every other Per&s;on allowed him. The Company ob&s;erved his Unea&s;ine&s;s, the Effect of a mean and malicious Envy. It is the Quality of that unju&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion, when it cannot blacken a &s;uperiour and generally-ac|knowledged Merit, to give Pain and Grief to its Owner at the Applau&s;es with which it is honoured. The Counte&s;s in her Heart &s;et a ju&s;t Value upon the Services her Family had received from the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> &s;he prai&s;ed him cautiou&s;ly, but inwardly acknow|ledged that a Lover &s;o brave and generous de&s;erved her mo&s;t tender E&s;teem.</P>
<P>The old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> remain|ed fifteen Days at <HI>Beauplan,</HI> after which he returned with his Son to <HI>Fontainebleau.</HI> He found his two Servants dead of their Wounds, which gave him a very &s;en&s;ible Grief. The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> being but &s;lightly wounded, &s;oon recovered their Health, as al&s;o the young Marquis <HI>de
<PB N="54" REF="55">
Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and his Second. But Love, which raged with a cruel Violence in the Heart of the wretched Chevalier, poi&s;oned all his Joys, and made Glory it&s;elf ta&s;tele&s;s to him.</P>
<P>Ab&s;ence, that Remedy &s;o often &s;ucce&s;sful in Love, rendered the Chevalier's Pa&s;&s;ion more ardent. He was not able to ta&s;te any Plea&s;ure while he remained bani&s;hed from <HI>Beauplan,</HI> the Idea of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> pur&s;ued him every where. A Lover le&s;s re|&s;pectful than him&s;elf, after having been &s;o happy as to render two &s;uch &s;ignal Services to the Father and Brother of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, would not have he&s;itated to have pre&s;ented him&s;elf before her: But awed by her Commands to the contrary, he rather cho&s;e to pine in Ab|&s;ence, and fall a Victim to the Torments that con&s;umed him, than offend her. He was likewi&s;e apprehen&s;ive that the two Mar|qui&s;es <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> were &s;till at <HI>Beauplan,</HI> but it was the Pre&s;ence of young <HI>Berci</HI> which he dreaded more than that of any other. He knew he was acquainted with his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s his Si&s;ter-in-law, he trembled at the Thoughts of &s;uch an intere&s;ted Ob&s;er|ver, as he would prove, he could not hope for an Opportunity of entertaining the Counte&s;s, amid&s;t &s;uch a crowd of Relations and Friends. So many Ob&s;tacles were not capable of damp|ing one Moment the Ardour of his Pa&s;&s;ion. His Impatience to &s;ee the charming Counte&s;s increa&s;ed with the Difficulties of gratifying it;
<PB N="55" REF="56">
yet he determined to &s;tay at <HI>Paris</HI> till he had by a Letter demanded her Permi&s;&s;ion to wait on her at <HI>Beauplan,</HI> and he fixed upon one of his Servants, who&s;e Fidelity he had often ex|perienced, to be the Bearer of it.</P>
<P>During the Time that the Chevalier had re&s;ided with the Count, he became acquainted with a Woman who lived in a Village at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the Ca&s;tle. He fore&s;aw that he might one Day have Occa&s;ion for her A&s;&s;i&s;tance in his Pa&s;&s;ion, and by rich Pre|&s;ents he had entirely &s;ecured her in his In|tere&s;t. He was too prudent, and had too much Re&s;pect for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> to make her the Confidant of his Love for that Lady; therefore he told her that he was fond of one of her Women, who&s;e Name was <HI>Marianne.</HI> This Girl was greatly beloved by the Coun|te&s;s, and entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her Confidence. The Chevalier had gained her by the &s;ame Methods as the Country-Woman, and &s;he had promi&s;ed him to deliver his Letters to her Lady. The Chevalier wrote to the Counte&s;s with a trembling Hand, and a Heart agitated by a thou&s;and Fears. He gave the Letter to his Servant with full In&s;tructions how to act, ordering him above all Things not to go to <HI>Beauplan</HI> till it was Night, and to &s;et out again from thence at the fir&s;t Dawn of Day.</P>
<P>This faithful Dome&s;tick executed his Ma&s;|ter's Orders with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s. He delivered the Letter to the Woman, it was
<PB N="56" REF="57">
inclo&s;ed in a Cover directed to <HI>Marianne</HI>; he likewi&s;e gave her two Chains of Gold from his Ma&s;ter, one for <HI>Marianne,</HI> and the other for her&s;elf, in reward of her Fidelity. The next Day the Country-Woman after locking up the Chevalier's Servant in her Hou&s;e, went to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> and ea&s;ily acquitted her&s;elf of her Commi&s;&s;ion, no Per&s;on in the Hou&s;e having the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of the Cau&s;e of her coming. <HI>Marianne</HI> took an Opportu|nity to give the Letter to the Counte&s;s, when &s;he retired in the Evening to her Clo&s;et. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was at fir&s;t &s;urprized and angry at the Boldne&s;s of her Woman, &s;he reproved her &s;everely, and for a long Time refu&s;ed to receive the Letter from her Hands. But this Girl, who had &s;ome Power over the Mind of her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and who wanted nei|ther Wit nor Cunning, u&s;ed &s;o many Argu|ments to prove that &s;he might without Re|proach receive a Letter from a Man to whom &s;he owed &s;uch extraordinary Obligations, that the Counte&s;s, overcame at length by her Rea|&s;ons, and &s;ecretly per&s;uaded by the Motions of her own Heart, took the Chevalier's Letter from her, and opening it with extreme Agi|tation, read the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>How &s;hall a Lover, Madam, whom you have condemned to Silence, whom you have bani&s;hed from your Sight, make known the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion? Yet to be allowed to make you &s;en&s;ible that he loves you, is the only Con&s;olation he requires. Is it too
<PB N="57" REF="58">
much Pre&s;umption to wi&s;h to be pitied by you, when Pity is all he dares hope for or reque&s;t? But how can you pity unle&s;s you are a Witne&s;s of the Torments I endure: And how can you be a Witne&s;s of them while I remain bani&s;hed from your Sight? Con&s;ider, Madam, I be&s;eech you, that this Exile which I have &s;uffered is your own Work. At length relent, and permit me to approach you, again afford me the Ble&s;&s;ing of beholding you, 'tis all I a&s;k, and it is the only Means of pre&s;erving a Life which I would lo&s;e with Plea&s;ure to do you Ser|vice. Your An&s;wer will determine my Fate.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was greatly affected with this Letter, &s;ome Sighs e&s;caped her unknown to her&s;elf, the Chevalier's re&s;pect|ful Pa&s;&s;ion lulled all her Su&s;picions a&s;leep, and the unhappy State of his Mind excited her Pity. Neverthele&s;s &s;he was in Doubt whether &s;he ought to write him an An&s;wer, Rea&s;on and Honour dictated to her that a virtuous Woman ought not to indulge her&s;elf in a Cor|re&s;pondence, however innocent, with a Man who is her profe&s;t Lover. But Gratitude and Compa&s;&s;ion pleaded the Chevalier's Cau&s;e with &s;uch inre&s;i&s;table Force, that &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he might write to him and even &s;ee him, without wounding the Duty &s;he owed her Hu&s;band. The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> de&s;igned the next Day to accompany his Father and Brother to <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> &s;he therefore re|&s;olved
<PB N="58" REF="59">
not only to write an An&s;wer to the Chevalier, but al&s;o to take Advantage of her Hu&s;band's Ab&s;ence, to give him an Interview in private, and taking up the Pen &s;he wrote to him in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>I an&s;wer your Letter, Mon&s;ieur, con|trary to the Rules my Duty impo&s;es upon me, to put you in Mind of yours, which is to cea&s;e a Pur&s;uit that will infallibly be fruitle&s;s, and may be fatal. Hope for nothing from me beyond E&s;teem and Gratitude, the one I cannot refu&s;e your Merit, and I owe the other to the Services you have lately render|ed me, in the Per&s;ons of my Father and Brother. I am willing to believe that you love me with Honour, and this Thought alone prevails with me to grant you Per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee me. I &s;hall be alone on Fri|day in the Afternoon, if this Letter reaches you &s;oon enough, you may come to <HI>Beau|plan,</HI> and at eleven o'Clock at Night you will find the Garden Door open, and <HI>Marianne</HI> attending to conduct you to me. See, Mon|&s;ieur, what Hazards I run to expre&s;s my Acknowledgement for the Obligations you have conferred upon me. But again I warn you not to expect that you can ever in&s;pire me with any other Sentiments, than what the mo&s;t rigid Virtue will permit a rea&s;ona|ble Woman to entertain.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, who was too innocent and unexperienced to reflect on the Con&s;equences
<PB N="59" REF="60">
of &s;uch a &s;u&s;picious Interview, was very well &s;atisfied with the Terms in which &s;he had conceived her Letter. But this fal&s;e Step, however guiltle&s;s &s;he was in Intention, was &s;oon followed by the mo&s;t dreadful Alarms, it expo&s;ed her to the greate&s;t Danger &s;he had ever been in during her whole Life, and was the Source of all tho&s;e Misfortunes &s;he after|wards proved. The Country-Woman re|turned the next Morning to the Ca&s;tle, and received the An&s;wer which the Counte&s;s had written from the Hands of <HI>Marianne:</HI> that Girl pretended it was a Letter from her to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> The Chevalier's Servant &s;et out for <HI>Paris,</HI> as &s;oon as it was dark, and mindful of his Ma&s;ter's Orders made &s;uch ha&s;te that he arrived there early the next Day. Although there was nothing in the Counte&s;s's Letter, which could flatter the Che|valier with a Hope, of being more happy than Compa&s;&s;ion, re&s;trained by Duty could make him; yet it filled him with inconceivable Tran&s;port, and he mounted on Hor&s;eback that In&s;tant, in order to be at <HI>Beauplan</HI> at the appointed Time.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> took Hor&s;e to attend his Father and Brother-in-law to <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> that very Day on which the Chevalier arrived at <HI>Beauplan.</HI> As he went only in complai|&s;ance to the Marquis and his Son, they would not &s;uffer him to go farther than half way, and then obliged him to return back. The Counte&s;s who had not expected to &s;ee her
<PB N="60" REF="61">
Hu&s;band that Night, was greatly perplexed at his Return; &s;he now repented of the A&s;&s;ignation &s;he had made the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and was in dreadful Unea&s;ine&s;s le&s;t it &s;hould be di&s;covered: Yet &s;he concealed her Agitations from her Hu&s;band as well as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could, but &s;he was too much di&s;|ordered to be able to eat any Supper. The Count was unea&s;y, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he was indi&s;|po&s;ed. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> eagerly catched at that Expedient, and made it her Excu&s;e for retiring immediately after Supper to her Chamber. The Count attributing his Wife's Indi&s;po|&s;ition to her Grief at parting with her Father and Brother, obligingly endeavoured to con|&s;ole her, and conducting her to her Apart|ment, withdrew to his own.</P>
<P>The Night was dark and cloudy, and &s;a|voured the De&s;ires of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who was very &s;olicitious to prevent being &s;een near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould re|flect any Di&s;honour upon the Character of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. The whole Family was already enjoying the Sweets of a profound Repo&s;e, when <HI>Marianne</HI> going &s;oftly out of her Lady's Apartment, went to the Gate; &s;he there found the pa&s;&s;ionate Chevalier, who lover-like had through Impatience come an Hour &s;ooner than he was directed, and had waited for her with great Anxiety. <HI>Marianne</HI> did not fail to ex|aggerate the Danger to which &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf to do him Service, and prote&s;ted her Zeal for his Intere&s;t &s;o &s;trongly, that the Che|valier,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
who thought the Moments too preci|ous to wa&s;te in Thanks, took a fine Ring off his Finger, and gave it to the faithful Con|fidant in acknowledgement of her Kindne&s;s: &s;he then de&s;ired him to follow her with the utmo&s;t Precaution, and brought him without being di&s;covered, into the Apartment of the Counte&s;s. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> looked &s;o charm|ing in the elegant Undre&s;s &s;he was in, that the Chevalier, lo&s;t in Admiration and De&s;ire, al|mo&s;t forgot the Condition upon which he was permitted to &s;ee her. But the lovely Counte&s;s, who was capable of in&s;piring at once Re&s;pect and Love, repre&s;t this fir&s;t Tran&s;port by a mode&s;t Regard, full of mingled Sweet|ne&s;s and Severity; then de&s;iring the Cheva|lier to be &s;eated, &s;he &s;poke thus to him:</P>
<P><Q>If you knew, Mon&s;ieur, the Danger to which I expo&s;e my Reputation, and per|haps my Life, by &s;eeing you here, the&s;e &s;light Charms would take up le&s;s of your Attention. My Lord is not at <HI>Fontaine|bleau</HI> with my Father as I expected he would have been this Night, he is retired to his own Chamber in complai&s;ance to me: his unexpected Return to <HI>Beauplan</HI> perplex|ed me greatly, and in order to keep my Word with you, I have been obliged to feign my&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed; do not then, Mon|&s;ieur, abu&s;e a Favour which I could not re|fu&s;e to your earne&s;t Intreaties, and to the In|tere&s;t I take in the Pre&s;ervation of your Life, which you have &s;o lately ventured in

the Service of my Family. In your Fa|vour I have in &s;ome Degree tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Laws of Decorum: the Con&s;ideration I have had for you, ought to &s;ecure your Gra|titude, and to prevent your Forming any Hopes from a Conde&s;cen&s;ion I cannot help condemning in my&s;elf: know this is the la&s;t Time you mu&s;t ever expect to &s;ee me alone.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s had &s;carce uttered the&s;e la&s;t Words, when &s;ome body knocked ha&s;tily at the Door of the Antichamber: the Cheva|lier did not doubt but it was the Count, and began to &s;u&s;pect that Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> had laid this Snare to ruin him: when he was fir&s;t told that a Man whom he had &s;uppo&s;ed to be at <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> was in his own Chamber in that very Hou&s;e, he entertained &s;ome Su&s;|picions again&s;t the Counte&s;s, but had already rejected them as too injurious to that amiable Lady, when the Noi&s;e at the Door of her Antichamber awaked them again in his Mind; and now not doubting any longer that he was betrayed,
<Q>Madam, &s;aid he to the Counte&s;s, you had many other Ways of freeing your|&s;elf from a Pa&s;&s;ion which you doubtle&s;s thought too importunate, without &s;acrifi|&s;ing me to your Hu&s;band's Revenge. But be a&s;&s;ured, Madam, I will not lo&s;e my Life without putting that of your Lord's into Danger, into who&s;e Hands you have deli|vered me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64"><Q>Ah, how you injure me by the&s;e Su&s;pi|cions, replied the Counte&s;s, half dead with fear! it is not now a Time to endeavour by Oaths to a&s;&s;ure you of my Sincerity, but the Te&s;timony you will &s;oon have of it will make you know the Inju&s;tice you do me; but retire, I conjure you, behind the Tapi&s;try, you will be ab&s;olutely &s;afe from a Di&s;covery there, and if you are not con|vinced of my Innocence, &s;acrifice my Life to your Revenge.</Q>
She &s;poke the&s;e Words with a low Voice, and then called <HI>Marianne,</HI> who had heard the Knocking at the Door but like one that under&s;tood her Bu&s;ine&s;s well, made no Offers to &s;tir, till &s;he had Di|rections from her Lady. The Chevalier a little rea&s;&s;ured by his Mi&s;tre&s;s Words, placed him&s;elf behind the Tapi&s;try, holding it clo&s;e with his left Hand, but through a little Opening which he left that he might &s;ee who came into the Room, he held a Pocket-Pi&s;tol which he re&s;olved in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, to u&s;e in his own Defence.</P>
<P><HI>Marianne</HI> as if hardly awake, came into her Lady's Room with a loo&s;e Gown on, and went to open the Door of the Antichamber to her Lord, for it was he that demanded Entrance. The Count, as he approached his Wife, pa&s;&s;ed &s;o near the Place where the Chevalier was concealed, that he touched the End of the Pi&s;tol: the Chevalier ac|knowledged afterwards that he was never &s;o much alarmed in his Life; but the Count
<PB N="64" REF="65">
went on without ob&s;erving any Thing, and &s;eeing that his Wife was not yet in Bed, he &s;at down upon the Sopha which the Cheva|lier had quitted but a few Moments before, and with a Look of tender Anxiety, which relieved the Counte&s;s from &s;ome Part of her Fears, enquired how &s;he did.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> an&s;wered in a low Voice, that &s;he had been wor&s;e &s;ince Supper, that &s;he was feveri&s;h and ju&s;t going to Bed, to try if &s;he could get a little Re&s;t, which &s;he hoped would relieve her. The Count taking her Hand felt her Pul&s;e, which from the Terrors with which &s;he was agitated, beating a little unequally.
<Q>You are indeed di&s;ordered, &s;aid the tender Count, but I hope your Illne&s;s will not be dangerous, I could not be ea&s;y till I &s;aw you, I have been but a few Mo|ments in Bed yet was terrified by a hor|rid Dream from which I awaked in Agonies. I dreamt a mon&s;trous Dragon was going to devour you: your Indi&s;po&s;ition which I had imagined was but &s;light, ro&s;e to my thoughts, I began to be apprehen&s;ive that this was the Dragon, and that you were grown much wor&s;e &s;ince I &s;aw you, I came eagerly to know the State of your Health, and thank Heaven I find it better than I expected; but why are you not in bed? Let me have the Satisfaction to &s;ee you en|joying a quiet Sleep before I return to my own Apartment.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66">The Chevalier's Su&s;picions returned when he heard the Count relate his Dream, he was ab&s;olutely per&s;uaded that he was di&s;covered, and the Counte&s;s dreadfully alarmed knew not what to expect. The Count's Interpre|tation of his Dream, rea&s;&s;ured them a little, but when they found he intended to &s;tay &s;ome Time longer, and that he pre&s;&s;ed Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> to go to Bed, all again &s;eemed lo&s;t. The Chevalier was apprehen&s;ive that he &s;hould not be able to continue long in the Situation he was in, for it was extreamly unea&s;y. Neverthele&s;s as he had a great deal of Courage, and was very much in love, the Hope of the Count's retiring in an Hour, &s;upported him under &s;o di&s;agreeable a Re&s;traint; but he indulged his ill Humour with &s;ecretly execrating this too tender Hu&s;|band, who after three Years Marriage came &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably to give his Wife a Proof of his Fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was obliged to go to Bed, and under pretence that the Taper which the Count had brought in with him glared too full in her Eyes, &s;he ordered <HI>Ma|rianne</HI> to draw the Curtain on that Side where the Chevalier &s;tood concealed. <HI>Marianne</HI> obeying her Lady's Orders with too much Precipitation, di&s;ingaged her&s;elf from a little Dog which had followed the Count into his Wife's Apartment: the Animal being free ran to the Place where the trembling Lover was concealed, and di&s;covering in&s;tinctively
<PB N="66" REF="67">
that a Stranger was in the Room, he began to bark &s;o loud, that the Count was ri&s;ing from his Seat to endeavour to pacify him him|&s;elf. But the Counte&s;s in great agitation held back her Hu&s;band. And <HI>Marianne</HI> coaxing the little Creature into good Humour, at la&s;t catched him in her Arms, and carried him into her own Chamber, where &s;he did not fail to beat him &s;everely, for his un&s;ea&s;onable Fidelity to his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Ber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i</HI> finding her Hu&s;band re&s;olved to &s;tay &s;till &s;he was quite compo&s;ed, was obliged to counterfeit her&s;elf a&s;leep, and the Count when he was a&s;&s;ured &s;he was &s;o, ri&s;ing &s;oftly, went out of her Apartment and retired to his own. His Ab&s;ence relieved the Counte&s;s and the Chevalier from terrible Inquietude: the ardent Lover as &s;oon as he was withdrawn, left the Place of his Con|cealment and went to the Counte&s;s's Bed-&s;ide, where he threw him&s;elf on his Knees, and im|plored her pardon, for the ungenerous Su&s;pi|cion he had entertained. The Counte&s;s &s;weetly blu&s;hing at the Situation &s;he was in before her Lover, told him &s;he had already pardoned him, and hoped that for the future he would judge more candidly of her Sincerity and Honour. The Chevalier &s;carce li&s;tened to what &s;he &s;aid, he had not only forgot his pa&s;t Danger, but al&s;o the Conditions to which he had bound him&s;elf when he reque&s;ted an in|terview with the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68"><Q>In&s;olent Man, cried the Counte&s;s, darting a di&s;dainful Look at him, and pu&s;hing him away with all her Force, is it thus that you abu&s;e the Credulity of an unhappy Woman, who has &s;o lately expo&s;ed, both her Honour, and her Life for you? Ba&s;e and ungrate|ful as you are, was it to cover your impious De&s;igns that the&s;e Appearances of Re&s;pect and Submi&s;&s;ion were a&s;&s;umed? But go avoid my Sight, and thank my Clemency that I content my&s;elf with Depriving you for ever of my E&s;teem, without making you feel the ju&s;t Effects of my Indignation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! Madam, replied the impetuous Che|valier, how can you imagine I &s;hould be Ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, expo&s;ed to the A&s;&s;ault of &s;o many Charms? My Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;tronger than my Rea&s;on, its Violence is my Ex|cu&s;e, and I ought le&s;s to excite your An|ger for my Pre&s;umption, than your Com|pa&s;&s;ion for the Mi&s;eries I have &s;uffered.</Q>
The&s;e Words were not calculated to remove the Counte&s;s's Anger, any more than the Behaviour by which they were followed. That unfortunate Lady, now fir&s;t perceiving the Danger to which &s;he had expo&s;ed her Virtue, a&s;&s;umed more Courage and Re&s;olu|tion, &s;he called <HI>Marianne</HI> with loud Cries, the Terror &s;he was in not giving her Time to reflect that her Hu&s;band might be alar|med: her Woman appearing, the Chevalier full of Repentance for his Attempt, retired from the Bed-&s;ide, the Counte&s;s no longer
<PB N="68" REF="69">
ob&s;erving any Terms with him, commanded him with a Look and Voice which made him tremble, to leave her Chamber, and fiercely threatened to &s;end for her Lord, and &s;hew him the real Dragon which he had &s;een only in his Dream, unle&s;s he obeyed her that In&s;tant.</P>
<P>It was in vain that the unhappy Chevalier endeavoured by Tears and Prayers to &s;often the Anger of his incen&s;ed Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he was inexorable, and he was obliged to quit her, with the Grief of knowing that he had lo&s;t her E&s;teem by giving way to the Impe|tuo&s;ity of his De&s;ires. Fatal Love, blind and ungovernable Pa&s;&s;ion, thy highe&s;t Fa|vours are too deerly purcha&s;ed by the Dan|gers, the Inquietude, and the Remor&s;e thou cau&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Chevalier, full of Shame and Grief, was a hundred Times ready to run his Sword through his Heart, before the Eyes of Madam <HI>de Berci.</HI>
<Q>Adieu, Madam, &s;aid he to her, my unfeigned Repentance and the mi&s;erable Life I am going to drag on at a Di&s;tance from you, will I hope one Day procure me Pardon for an Attempt as fruitle&s;s as it was involuntary.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s did not deign to &s;ay a &s;ingle Word to him in An&s;wer, and the Chevalier not daring to importune her any farther, made her a low Bow and followed <HI>Marianne,</HI> who
<PB N="69" REF="70">
conducted him to the Door of the Anti-cham|ber without any Light for fear of being per|ceived. The Chevalier was in &s;uch agitation of Mind, that he hardly knew what he was doing, and as he de&s;cended the Stairs, his Foot &s;lipping he tumbled down, and the Pi&s;tol which he held in his Hand for Fear of &s;ome Accident, went off, and alarmed the whole Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Count, his Brother, and &s;everal of the Men Servants got up immediately, and made the Ca&s;tle re&s;ound with their Cries of Thieves, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The Counte&s;s at the Report of the Pi&s;tol, was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with her Apprehen&s;ions: &s;he heard her Lord's Voice, and knew not whether the Chevalier had fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed at him, or the Count at the Chevalier. <HI>Ma|rianne,</HI> who had quitted the Chevalier at the Door of the Anti-chamber, and who knew not any more than her Lady the true Cau&s;e of what had happened, trembled at the Puni&s;h|ment which &s;he expected, and bemoaned her|&s;elf piteou&s;ly; the whole Ca&s;tle was full of Tumult and Di&s;order.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Chevalier who found him&s;elf at the Bottom of the Stairca&s;e by his Fall, mi&s;&s;ing his Hat and his Pi&s;tol, re&s;olved not to leave them behind him, tho' by &s;tay|ing to look for them, he run the Danger of being &s;eized; but he was &s;en&s;ible if tho&s;e Things were found, it would be known that it was he who had been there, and that was
<PB N="70" REF="71">
equal to a Di&s;covery of his Per&s;on. The Moon gave Light enough through the Win|dows to direct his Search, and he was &s;o for|tunate as to find both his Hat and Pi&s;tol, and to reach the Garden Gate without being di&s;|covered; &s;ome of the Count's Servants ran thither a few Moments after, and finding the Gate open, they &s;uppo&s;ed the Thieves had e&s;caped that way; they had a Glimp&s;e of the Chevalier as he ran, but it was not light enough for them to di&s;tingui&s;h his Per&s;on; however &s;uppo&s;ing him to be one of the Rogues, they pur&s;ued him, but the Cheva|lier made &s;uch Speed that he joined his Ser|vant, who was waiting for him, before the Fellows could come up with him, and mount|ing his Hor&s;e which his Man held ready, he gallopped acro&s;s the Country without keep|ing any direct Road, and at la&s;t got to a Vil|lage where he concealed him&s;elf for a few Hours, and then returned to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Chevalier DES ESSARS AND THE Counte&s;s OF BERCI. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Count of <HI>Berci</HI> and his Brother, who had been among the fir&s;t that were alarmed by the Report of the Pi&s;tol, having, as has been already &s;aid, ri&s;en in ha&s;te, they armed them&s;elves with their Swords and Pi&s;|tols, and followed by &s;ome of the Servants who carried Flambeaux in their Hands, they went to the Apartment of the Counte&s;s, who&s;e Terror at &s;eeing her Lord and his Bro|ther enter with &s;uch a formidable Equipage was &s;o great, that &s;he fainted away. The
<PB N="72" REF="73">
The Count full of Grief at this Accident, ran eagerly to her, Remedies were applied, but her Hu&s;band's tender Solicitude, and the af|fectionate Things he &s;aid to her, had more Efficacy in recovering her Spirits, than all the other Endeavours which were u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It was her Fear that the Chevalier had been di&s;covered, which reduced her to that Condi|tion, but her Lord's exce&s;&s;ive Concern for it convinced her that the Chevalier had had the good Fortune to e&s;cape without being known. This Thought re&s;tored her Spirits, and the Count entirely di&s;&s;ipated all her Su&s;picions by telling her, that the Tumult and Noi&s;e there had been in the Hou&s;e, was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome Rogues who had attempted to rob it.</P>
<P><Q>I beg, Madam, &s;aid he embracing her tenderly, that you will not &s;uffer your&s;elf to be alarmed thus to the Prejudice of your Health: my Brother and my&s;elf will go and &s;earch every Part of the Ca&s;tle, that we may be a&s;&s;ured none of the&s;e Villains are concealed in it. Bani&s;h your Fears then, and depend upon it, added he &s;miling, that if we find &s;ome of the&s;e Rogues lurking here &s;till, we will give you a good Account of them.</Q>
He then ordered the Counte&s;s's Woman to be called, to &s;tay in the Cham|ber, and leaving two of the Footmen to guard the Door of her Apartment, he went with his Brother and the others to &s;earch the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">The Count after traver&s;ing over the whole Hou&s;e, went down into the Court Yard, where he met two of his Servants who had ju&s;t returned from pur&s;uing the Chevalier. They had run after him a long Time in the Fields, but, the Chevalier being well moun|ted, as were his Servants likewi&s;e, he was &s;oon out of Sight; and the Count's Footmen thinking it was needle&s;s to follow them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny farther at &s;uch a Di&s;advantage, came home no wi&s;er than they went.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they &s;aw the Count, they related to him what they had done, and as in their terrified Imaginations, the Chevalier and his Servant, appeared to be five or &s;ix Men; &s;o they did not fail to double the Number and confidently affirm that there were no le&s;s than a dozen Rogues whom their Pre&s;ence, un|armed as they were, put to Flight. Another who had a mind to have it &s;aid that he al&s;o had a Share in this terrible Adventure, de|clared with great firmne&s;s of Countenance, that it was at him the Rogue who had got Entrance into the Hou&s;e, fired the Pi&s;tol, and that he heard the Whizzing of the Ball as it happily pa&s;t by his Ear without hurting him.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> fully per&s;uaded that the Ca&s;tle had been be&s;et by Robbers, went up to his Wife's Apartment.
<Q>I told you, Madam, &s;aid he as he entred, that there was nothing to apprehend: my Servants have ju&s;t now informed me, that the
<PB N="74" REF="75">
Thieves, alarmed at the Noi&s;e we made, and by the Lights &s;uppo&s;ing the whole Fa|mily was up, are fled with the utmo&s;t Pre|cipitation; one of them had, it &s;eems, got over the Garden Walls, in order to open the Gate to the others, but as &s;oon as it is Day, I &s;hall take Care to prevent &s;uch At|tempts for the future, by making it im|po&s;&s;ible for any one to climb over tho&s;e Walls again. Think no more then, I con|jure you, Madam, of what is pa&s;t, all now is &s;afe, try to calm your Mind, and get an Hour or two's Repo&s;e. I am extremely apprehen&s;ive that the Alarms you have &s;uf|fered this Night will di&s;order you greatly.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s full of inward Remor&s;e, which her Lord's exce&s;&s;ive Tenderne&s;s re|doubled, begged him to retire to his own Chamber, and &s;he would try to compo&s;e her|&s;elf. She could &s;carce retrain her Tears as &s;he &s;poke, her Voice faltered, the Count &s;aw her greatly di&s;ordered, but far from gue&s;&s;ing the Cau&s;e, he concluded all was owing to the Terrors &s;he had been in on Account of the Attempt he &s;uppo&s;ed had been made on the Ca&s;tle: he de&s;ired her Women to watch by their Lady, and then taking Leave of her with a tender Embrace and an ardent Ejaculation for her Health, he returned to his own Apart|ment.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, as &s;oon as her Lord was withdrawn, commanded her Women to quit
<PB N="75" REF="76">
her Chamber: &s;he longed to be alone to give free Vent to her Tears. A Woman who has ju&s;t Notions of Honour, needs no other Tormentors, when &s;he has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the &s;trict Laws of it, than the Stings of her own Con&s;cience. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> had through Ignorance of the World, and by her too great Sen&s;ibility of the Services the Chevalier had done her Family, been betrayed to make a fal&s;e Step, which &s;he too late acknowledged to be &s;o. Her Eyes were opened by the Chevalier's Behaviour, &s;he was enabled to judge of the Irregularity of her Conduct, by the Advantage her unworthy Lover had en|deavoured to take of it. She trembled at the Remembrance of the Danger to which &s;he had expo&s;ed her Virtue, &s;he accu&s;ed her&s;elf, &s;he exclaimed again&s;t the Ba&s;ene&s;s of the Che|valier.
<Q>Unhappy Wretch, cried &s;he bur&s;t|ing into Tears, what ha&s;t thou done? and what would have been thy Fate, if Heaven, re&s;pecting the Innocence of thy Intentions, had not had Compa&s;&s;ion upon thee. Ju&s;tly dete&s;ted by a Hu&s;band who now adores thee, thy lea&s;t Puni&s;hment, if he had &s;pared thy Life, would have been to be confounded with Women of infamous Reputation, up|on who&s;e Forehead is engraved in Charac|ters never to be effaced, the &s;hameful Story of their Crimes. And, oh fatal Aggravation of my Folly, &s;uch a Hu&s;band&mdash;blu&s;h, blu&s;h, ungrateful Wretch, at the Remembrance of his Tenderne&s;s. What Return ha&s;t thou
<PB N="76" REF="77">
made for this unexampled Affection? Thou ha&s;t not &s;crupled to endanger the Quiet of his whole Life, by &s;ubmitting to a private Interview with a Man, who&s;e wild Pa&s;&s;ion thou wa&s;t but too well acquainted with: thou ha&s;t introduced into his Hou&s;e at the dead of Night the premeditated A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his Honour. Thou may&s;t judge, unhappy Woman, by the Grief with which thou &s;awe&s;t him overwhelmed for thy feigned Sickne&s;s, what would have been his Ago|nies if thy fatal Secret had been di&s;covered. Oh may&s;t thou be ever ignorant of it, my dear and injured Lord, and may my Re|pentance and my Tears blot out of my Heart the Image of that mo&s;t in&s;olent and mo&s;t ba&s;e of Men.</Q></P>
<P>With &s;uch Complaints, and in &s;uch bitter Reflexions, did the unhappy Counte&s;s wa&s;te the remaining Part of the Night. Quiet was bani&s;hed from her Mind, and Sleep from her Eyes: the Morning found her bathed in Tears, and &s;eized with the fir&s;t Symptoms of a Fever, which in a few Days increa&s;ed to &s;uch a Degree, that her Life was de&s;paired of. Her Lord almo&s;t di&s;tracted at the Danger &s;he was in, never quitted her a Moment during eight Days, that the Phy&s;icians thought her Recovery doubtful. Her Youth at length, and her good Con&s;titution, overcame the Violence of her Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;he began to recover tho' by &s;low Degrees, and in this State we &s;hall leave

her, and &s;ee what pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> where we left the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived he went immediately to pay his Re&s;pects to his Maje&s;ty, his gracious Ma&s;ter, under whom he had made his la&s;t Campaigns. His De&s;ign was to &s;olicit a Pardon for his Son, as likewi&s;e for the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> to whom he was &s;o greatly obliged. That great Monarch, who never forgot the Services of his faithful Subjects, gave the Marquis a mo&s;t gracious Reception, and with that Affability, which was &s;o natural to him, welcomed him to Court, and enquir|ed into the Motive which had induced him to quit his Retreat.</P>
<P><Q>Sire, replied the old Man, the De&s;ire of &s;eeing once more the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Kings, and of embracing my Children, has brought me again and probably for the la&s;t Time to Court. I find my&s;elf ha&s;ting for|ward to my Decay, and all that for the future I &s;hall be able to do, will be to pray for your Maje&s;ty's Glory, and Happine&s;s; but I would beg Leave to pre&s;ent a young Man to you in my Stead, who eagerly pants to follow you in your glorious Expe|ditions, and wi&s;hes for Life only to efface by his Courage and Loyalty &s;hewn in your Service, the Shame and Di&s;grace he has incurred by di&s;obeying your wi&s;e Laws. It is for my Son, mo&s;t gracious Sovereign,
<PB N="78" REF="79">
that I plead, and mo&s;t humbly implore that your Maje&s;ty will pardon him a Fault he has committed lately, and impute it to the wild Sallies of incon&s;iderate. Youth, and not to &s;tubborn Will, and premeditated Di&s;obedience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> &s;aid that ge|nerous Prince, if your Son has failed in the Re&s;pect and Obedience he owes me by his la&s;t Combat, I have not forgot tho&s;e in which you have formerly &s;hed your Blood for my Service; I therefore not only grant you his Pardon, which I cannot refu&s;e to your Services, but al&s;o that of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> which probably you was afraid to a&s;k for. I have been informed of your Adventure in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau:</HI> the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;o generou&s;ly gave you, and his Valour in &s;aving your Life, engages me to grant this, and to pardon him out of Con&s;ideration to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sire, replied the old Man in a Rapture, throwing him&s;elf at the King's Feet, I have not Words to expre&s;s my grateful Sen&s;e of your Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s in thus granting me the Life of my Son: your Maje&s;ty, who like a God has read tho&s;e Wi&s;hes in my Heart, which I did not dare to give Utterance to, be&s;t knows how much I am affected with your unmerited Indulgence. Yes, my gracious Lord, you have prevented my mo&s;t ardent De&s;ires, and by granting
<PB N="79" REF="80">
me the Life of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> you have given me an Opportunity of returning in &s;ome Degree the Obligations I have to that valiant Man, to who&s;e Genero&s;ity I owe the Happine&s;s I now enjoy of embrace|ing the Knees of my indulgent Ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>The old Marquis then &s;tepping to his Son, who was &s;tanding behind a Crowd of Cour|tiers:
<Q>Approach, my Son, &s;aid he, and ble&s;s the Clemency of your Prince, who has been plea&s;ed, at my Interce&s;&s;ion, to pardon you, and re&s;olve to prove to him one Day, that the Life you have received from me, and which his Goodne&s;s has pre&s;erved, belongs wholly to him; and remember that you never more mu&s;t hazard it, but in his Service.</Q></P>
<P>The young Marquis approaching with a graceful Mode&s;ty, threw him&s;elf at the King's Feet, who rai&s;ed him up in&s;tantly, and a&s;&s;ured his Father, that he would take the Care of his Son's Fortune entirely upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this Manner it was, that the great <HI>Henry</HI> tempered Maje&s;ty with Sweetne&s;s, and accompanied tho&s;e Pardons he granted to his offending Subjects, with the mo&s;t &s;triking In&s;tances of Genero&s;ity and Goodne&s;s. Great and magnanimous Prince! thy Memory will live forever in the Hearts of all true <HI>French|men,</HI> and thy gentle Virtues be as much their
<PB N="80" REF="81">
Love and Veneration, as thy immortal Fame their Glory.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> as &s;oon as he had quitted the King, retired to his Apart|ment, eager to enjoy the delicate Plea&s;ure of acquainting the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> with what his Prince had ju&s;t done for him. He told him in his Letter, that the Pardon he had &s;olicited, was granted le&s;s to his weak Interce&s;&s;ion, than to his own Merit, and the Fame of his great Actions, and particularly to the Valour and Genero&s;ity he had &s;hewn in expo&s;ing his own Life in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Fontainebleau</HI> to &s;ave his. He added, that his mode&s;t Endeavours to conceal from him the Name of his Benefactor had all been fruitle&s;s, and that he had at length had the good Fortune to know a Man, from whom his Family were every Day receiving new Benefits; that the la&s;t Favour he had received from him in pre&s;erving the Life of his Son, &s;o greatly endeared the former to him, that he de&s;paired of ever finding Opportunities &s;uf|ficient to make known the Extent of his Gratitude.</P>
<P>The good old Man after having thus given Vent to the Overflowings of his grateful Heart, employed the few remaining Hours he &s;taid st <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> in giving &s;ome Le&s;|&s;ons of Wi&s;dom and Prudence to his Son, re|commending to him in the mo&s;t earne&s;t Man|ner
<PB N="81" REF="82">
to per&s;evere in his Loyalty to his Sove|reign, and never more to offend him by di&s;obeying his Commands.</P>
<P>He then &s;et out for his E&s;tate in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> where he arrived without meeting with any ill Accident. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur</HI> his Wife had heard &s;ome Reports con|cerning his Adventure in the Fore&s;t, as like|wi&s;e of her Son's Duel with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny.</HI> She had &s;uffered great Unea&s;ine&s;s, but the Recital her Lord made her of the happy Event of all, turned her Fears and Sorrows into tran&s;ports of Joy. She admired the Valour of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who&s;e Per&s;on &s;he was not acquainted with, but who&s;e Name and Quality &s;he knew, and was extremely impatient to &s;ee and thank a Man to whom &s;he was obliged for the Lives of her Hu&s;band and her Son.</P>
<P>But of what U&s;e was it to this brave Man, that his Merit was acknowledged by his Prince, and applauded by the public Voice, &s;ince all was not able to comfort him for the Lo&s;s of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's E&s;teem. We have al|ready related how he fortunately e&s;caped be|ing known by the Servants of the Count of <HI>Berci.</HI> After having wandered &s;everal Days about the Country, he at la&s;t took the Road to <HI>Paris,</HI> and arrived there full of the deepe&s;t De&s;pair. As he dur&s;t not venture abroad on Account of his la&s;t Combat, he confined him|&s;elf to his Hou&s;e all Day, and went out &s;ome|times
<PB N="82" REF="83">
at Night to vi&s;it Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny.</HI> It was not in his Power to conceal his Sadne&s;s from him, but all the Endeavours of this tender Friend to prevail upon him to di&s;clo&s;e the Cau&s;e were ineffectual: the Chevalier had too much Delicacy to make him the Confi|dent of his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> and he rather cho&s;e to &s;hut up all his Sorrow in his Heart, and want the Con&s;olation of a faithful and &s;ympathi&s;ing Friend, than fail in his Re&s;pect for her who was now dearer to him than ever.</P>
<P>He was in this cruel Situation, when he received the Letter from the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI>; it gave him at fir&s;t a tran|&s;ient Relief, and he ta&s;ted &s;ome Plea&s;ure in the A&s;&s;urances it brought him of the Friend|&s;hip and E&s;teem of a Man who was become &s;o dear to him. But a Letter which a few Days after he received from the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> gave him far more Satisfaction. That tender Friend wrote, that he had too long deprived him of the Plea&s;ure of embracing a Man to whom the Counte&s;s and him&s;elf had &s;uch great Obligations, that he could not bear his Ab&s;ence, and conjured him to &s;et out imme|diately for the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> where he &s;oon expected the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI>; and he likewi&s;e earne&s;tly intreated him to bring Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> with him, who, he &s;aid, mu&s;t be their Friend, &s;ince he was his.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">The Chevalier, firmly per&s;uaded that he had lo&s;t for ever the E&s;teem of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, did not figure to him&s;elf any Happine&s;s at <HI>Beauplan,</HI> farther than that he &s;hould enjoy the Sight of that inhuman Beauty. He could not flatter him&s;elf that he &s;hould be able to obtain her Pardon for the Offence he had committed, but he hoped that his Repentance and his Grief would excite her Pity. He therefore re&s;olved to gratify the Count of <HI>Berci</HI>'s obliging Impatience to &s;ee him, by an immediate Departure from <HI>Paris:</HI> he &s;hew|ed the Count's Letter to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> who, wearied with the Length of his Con|finement, accepted with Joy Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI>'s obliging Invitation. <HI>Beauplan</HI> being likewi&s;e but half a Day's Journey from Court, it gave him a better Opportunity of &s;oliciting his Pardon there, than he could do at <HI>Paris.</HI> As he had &s;everal powerful Protectors about the King's Per&s;on, was not the fir&s;t Aggre&s;|&s;or, and as his Maje&s;ty had pardoned the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> there was Room to hope he would not be the only one that was puni&s;hed. And accordingly his Friends exerted their Intere&s;t for him with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that they obtained his Pardon, which was &s;ent to him eight Days after his Arrival at <HI>Beauplan</HI> with the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was in extreme Per|plexity, when her Lord &s;ent to inform her that the Chevalier was come: the Count had
<PB N="84" REF="85">
not mentioned to her his Intention of writing to him at <HI>Paris,</HI> he did not doubt but &s;he would be rejoiced to &s;ee again a Man who had pre&s;erved her Father and Brother. He took Plea&s;ure in giving her, what he thought, an agreable Surprize. He &s;urprized her indeed more than he imagined, but &s;he was far from being plea&s;ed. The Chevalier entered her Apartment before &s;he had Time to an&s;wer her Lord, he advanced with a re&s;pectful Awe to &s;alute her. A Blu&s;h cau&s;ed at once by In|dignation and Shame, over&s;pread her Face, and gave her new Charms; but the Mortification &s;he felt at being obliged to conceal her ju&s;t Rage from the Chevalier, gave her great Pain. However the Force &s;he put upon her&s;elf to behave with Complai&s;ance was not perceived, and &s;he acted her Part &s;o artfully, that the Chevalier began to conceive Hopes &s;he might in Time be prevailed upon to forgive him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he an&s;wered the Compliments he made her, with Freedom and Politene&s;s, &s;he prai&s;ed his Valour and Genero&s;ity, &s;he returned him Thanks for the Services her Father and Bro|ther had received from him, but &s;he re&s;olved in her own Heart to make him pay dear for the Con&s;traint &s;he had been obliged to lay up|on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> continued a long Time embraced, and fully per&s;uaded of each other's Merit and reciprocal Tenderne&s;s, they drew more &s;trait than ever the Knot of their an|cient
<PB N="85" REF="86">
Friend&s;hip, which nothing after was able to loo&s;e. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> was received with great Kindne&s;s by the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> and his Brother, as likewi&s;e by the charming Counte&s;s, whom he greatly admired.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t Compliments were over, the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> related to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> the Story of the Robbers, painting with great Vivacity the Alarms which the whole Family had been in, and gave a long Account of an Affair that the Chevalier knew better than him&s;elf. The Chevalier had oc|ca&s;ion for all his Prudence and Art to conceal from the Company the Embarra&s;&s;ment this Recital threw him into: the Counte&s;s who was le&s;s able to repre&s;s or conceal her Emo|tions, &s;hewed a Concern while the Count was &s;peaking, &s;ufficient to have betrayed her, if it had not been a&s;cribed by him to the Re|membrance of the Terror &s;he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, who knew the Danger &s;he had been in, and &s;aw by her Looks that her Health had &s;uffered greatly, was &s;en&s;ibly afflicted at the Inconveniences he had brought upon her: he reproached him&s;elf a thou&s;and Times with his Ra&s;hne&s;s and Pre&s;umption, he cur&s;ed the fatal Effects of his impetuous Pa&s;&s;ion, and endeavoured to give her &s;ome Idea of his Grief and Repentance by his Looks, &s;ince he could not &s;peak to her: he was re&s;olved to try the fir&s;t Opportunity that offered, and let her know how much he had &s;uffered from his own
<PB N="86" REF="87">
Remor&s;e for having offended her, but be &s;ought in vain for &s;uch an Opportunity. Far from giving him one, &s;he avoided his Looks as much as po&s;&s;ible, and if by Chance her Eyes incountered his, &s;he would ha&s;tily withdraw them again, as if &s;he had &s;een a Ba&s;ili&s;k.</P>
<P>The Chevalier again applied for A&s;&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Marianne</HI>; he intreated this Woman to en|deavour to make his Peace for him: he gave her &s;everal Letters for the Counte&s;s, but &s;he would not receive them, and &s;everely re|proving her Woman for accepting of &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions, forbad her ever to do the like again upon Pain of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from her Service; and <HI>Marianne,</HI> tho' it would have been her Intere&s;t to have effected this Recon|ciliation, was &s;o terrified at this Threat, that &s;he would not afterwards concern her&s;elf in the Chevalier's Affairs.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Chevalier had been al|ready fifteen Days at <HI>Beauplan,</HI> and had u&s;ed every Artifice that Love and Wit could &s;ug|ge&s;t, to procure an Interview with the Coun|te&s;s, but in vain; when one Day ob&s;erving the Count to be employed in his Gardens, giving Directions to his Workmen for &s;ome new Embelli&s;hment, the Plan of which he had drawn him&s;elf, he quitted &s;ome Company that were walking with him, and ran to Madam <HI>de Berci's</HI> Apartment, re&s;olving to attempt every thing to gain her Pardon. But &s;he being always upon her Guard again&s;t &s;uch
<PB N="87" REF="88">
Surprizes; ro&s;e up as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw her Chamber Door open, and perceiving the Che|valier &s;he flew into her Clo&s;et, and fa&s;tened the Door. Her Lover in De&s;pair at this new In&s;tance of: her Rigour, &s;aid all that a Heart torn with Remor&s;e could dictate to move her, but his Complaints, his Prote&s;tations, and his Grief, were fruitle&s;s, &s;he carried her Severity &s;o far, that &s;he would not deign even to an&s;wer him, and he was obliged to withdraw for fear of irritating her &s;till more.</P>
<P>Her ob&s;tinate Re&s;entment could not break his Chains, he had merited it all, and his own Heart acknowledged that he did &s;o: incapable of vanqui&s;hing his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s, and de&s;pairing of ever being able to gain her Pardon, he re&s;olved to retire from a Hou&s;e where he was every day expo&s;ed to new Torments, and &s;eek a glorious Death in the Field.</P>
<P><HI>Holland</HI> was then the Theatre of War, as it was likewi&s;e the School for the brave&s;t Men that ever di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in Arms. The Arch-Duke threatned to attack <HI>Rhimberg,</HI> and the States were preparing to defend it. The Commanders on one &s;ide were the Mar|quis <HI>de Spinola,</HI> General of the Arch-duke's Army, and the valiant Count <HI>de Buguoy,</HI> the fir&s;t of whom had already acquired immortal Glory before <HI>O&s;tend</HI> with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Walloons.</HI> On the other was Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Orange,</HI> who&s;e Name alone is an Eulogium,
<PB N="88" REF="89">
he had with him a younger Brother who emu|lous of his Glory tread already in his Steps: he was indeed at the head of an Army le&s;s numerous than <HI>Spinola's,</HI> but it was chiefly compo&s;ed of the two mo&s;t gallant Nations in the World, I mean the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; in the Troops of the former were many of the Nobility, commanded by the great <HI>Bethune,</HI> and the brave <HI>Chatillon,</HI> who were preparing to join the Forces of Prince <HI>Maurice.</HI></P>
<P>Although the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> had been treated le&s;s cruelly than he was by his Mi&s;|tre&s;s, yet he loved Glory too much to remain an idle Spectator in <HI>France,</HI> of the Laurels his Countrymen were gaining: he mentioned his De&s;ign of making a Campaign in <HI>Holland,</HI> to the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who not only approved of it, but a&s;&s;ured him he would go thither like|wi&s;e, and both of them declaring their Re&s;o|lution next Morning to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> and the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> they would not be left behind.</P>
<P>The Count intreated his Brother to &s;tay with Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> during his Ab&s;ence, but this young Man full of a noble Ardour that could not be repre&s;&s;ed, was &s;en&s;ible how &s;hameful it would appear, to &s;tay in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> and be the Guardian of his Si&s;ter-in-law, while his elde&s;t Brother was expo&s;ing his Life to the uncertain Chance of War, he re&s;olved therefore to partake his La|bours and his Dangers, and all being con|cluded
<PB N="89" REF="90">
on, they gave Orders for their &s;everal Equipages to be prepared with the utmo&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was greatly afflicted when &s;he heard her Lord's De&s;ign, and that it was the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> who had per&s;uaded him to it. It was not difficult for her to di&s;cover that it was her rigorous Treatment of this un|fortunate Lover, which had induced him to take &s;uch a Re&s;olution. She now began to repent of the extreme Rigour &s;he had &s;hewn, which was going to deprive her of a Hu&s;band &s;o dear to her, attributing all her Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Thoughts of being &s;eparated from him, but it was in vain that &s;he endeavoured to con|ceal her Sentiments from her&s;elf. She could not without great Concern reflect on the Dangers to which her Lover was going to expo&s;e him|&s;elf, and although he had offended her, yet &s;he was apprehen&s;ive of the Effects of his De&s;|pair; and that Death, which he was going to &s;eek, would doubtle&s;s deprive her of a Lover for whom in &s;pite of all her Virtue and her Pride &s;he felt in her Heart &s;omething more tender than E&s;teem. But this was a Confe&s;|&s;ion &s;he dur&s;t not make to her&s;elf, and &s;tudi|ou&s;ly avoiding any Examination of her own Thoughts, &s;he endeavoured to per&s;uade her|&s;elf that all her Fears were upon her Lord's Account, he whom it was her Duty to love, and by whom &s;he was loved with &s;o much Tenderne&s;s. She re&s;olved therefore to prevail upon the Chevalier to lay a&s;ide their De&s;ign,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
&s;he thought &s;he could not have a better Motive for breaking through her Re&s;olution, never to have any private Di&s;cour&s;e with him, and did not in the lea&s;t Doubt, that by the Power &s;he had over him, &s;he could make him aban|don a De&s;ign which he had formed in De&s;pair, and &s;he per&s;uaded her&s;elf that if &s;he &s;ucceeded on this &s;ide, the Count her Hu&s;band would no longer think of leaving her.</P>
<P>Full of this Project, the Succe&s;s of which &s;he was &s;ure of in her own Imagination, &s;he fought for an Opportunity to &s;peak to the Chevalier, which however was not the lea&s;t difficult Part of her Undertaking, for he who de&s;paired of ever gaining her Pardon, and fearful of offending her farther, took Care never to throw him&s;elf in her Way as u&s;ual, &s;o that the Counte&s;s finding her&s;elf di&s;apoint|ed in her Endeavours to meet him alone, was beginning to doubt whether &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ucceed without making it her Reque&s;t to &s;peak to him, a Humiliation &s;he would fain have avoided, when Chance brought her one Day into a Room fronting the Garden where &s;he &s;aw the Chevalier alone, &s;tanding at a Window in an Attitude that &s;hewed he was wholly ab&s;orbed in Thought.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s exce&s;&s;ively plea&s;ed at this ac|cidental Meeting, approached the Window where he &s;tood, with an Intention to &s;peak to him, that very Moment, when the Che|valier &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he had no other De&s;ign than
<PB N="91" REF="92">
to amu&s;e her&s;elf with looking out of it, left it free to her with a re&s;pectful Bow, and went to the other End of the Room, where he &s;tood looking at the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> and the Mar|quis <HI>de Saint Sauveur,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mo|rigny,</HI> who were playing at Tennis.</P>
<P>It would not be ea&s;y to determine whether this Behaviour gave the Counte&s;s more Shame or Vexation, but it is certain that &s;he was ex|tremely di&s;appointed. She under&s;tood this In&s;tance of Re&s;pect in the Chevalier to be a plain Avowal of Contempt.
<Q>How in&s;olent he is, &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, but I will not give him Room to imagine, that I am weak enough to run after him; no, I will rather &s;uffer the Lo&s;s of all that is dear to me in the World.</Q>
She now leaned upon the Window pen&s;ive in her Turn, full of Re|flections very mortifying to her Pride; and fain would &s;he have forced her&s;elf to believe that her Pride only was concerned; &s;he felt Emotions more painful than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from Confu&s;ion and Anger, and the &s;uppo&s;ed Neglect of the Chevalier advanced his Affairs with the Counte&s;s more than all the Proofs he had hitherto given her of his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But he in the mean Time ob&s;erving the Counte&s;s to be in a deep Revery, knew not what to think of her Behaviour. He &s;oon began to repent he had left the Window; and after he had continued looking at the Players a few Moments, though his Attention
<PB N="92" REF="93">
was wholly employed another Way, he &s;tept forwards, with a De&s;ign to return to the Place he had quitted &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably, but the Counte&s;s, who was extremely piqued by what he had done, &s;eeing him approach, left the Window in her Turn, and went ha&s;tily out of the Room, darting a Look at him as &s;he pa&s;t, that upon any other Occa&s;ion would have given him inexpre&s;&s;ible Pain, but as he now interpreted it, filled him with a Joy he had never experienced before.</P>
<P>He comprehended in an In&s;tant all that had pa&s;&s;ed in the Heart of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. He was in Raptures at this new Mark of her Rigour, and thoroughly acquainted as he was with all the Motions of a Heart in Love, he &s;aw with inconceivable Tran&s;port, that the Di&s;dain and Rage which the Counte&s;s had darted from her Eyes, were the Effects of affronted Ten|derne&s;s and neglected Advances. He ble&s;&s;ed his good Fortune, and flattered him&s;elf with the &s;weet Idea of being more loved than he had believed, he re&s;igned him&s;elf up entirely to the intoxicating Charms of Hope. But this Alteration in his Affairs with the Counte&s;s, far from inducing him to lay a&s;ide his former De&s;ign, confirmed him in his Re&s;olution of pur&s;uing it, the War in <HI>Holland,</HI> he did not doubt, would afford him Opportunities of &s;hewing him&s;elf worthy of her E&s;teem, and this Thought alone was &s;ufficient, had he been le&s;s brave than he was, to make him eagerly embrace them.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">The Count and his Gue&s;ts having given over Play, went to Madam de <HI>Berci's</HI> Apart|ment. Her Vexation, which was vi&s;ible enough in her Eyes, made her Lord conclude, that &s;he was afflicting her&s;elf for his approach|ing Departure, which the had often endea|voured to prevent. He therefore applied him|&s;elf to make her approve of it as a Thing ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. He repre&s;ented to her the Di&s;grace he &s;hould incur if he neglected &s;o fa|vourable an Opportunity of acquiring Honour, and advancing his Fortune; a&s;&s;uring her, that although his Love for her would not permit him to wear out his Days in a &s;hameful Indo|lence, yet it &s;hould ha&s;ten his Return; be urged to her &s;o many &s;trong Rea&s;ons, and &s;o well calculated to make an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Mind of a Woman born with ju&s;t Notions of Honour, that &s;he could not help yielding to them, whatever Grief it might co&s;t her. It was then agreed upon by them both, that &s;he &s;hould go into the Province of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and &s;tay with her Father and Mother, during his Ab&s;ence, they earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing for &s;uch a Vi&s;it, and that in two Days he &s;hould take Leave of her to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> and fini&s;h the Preparations for his Journey.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, though greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with the Chevalier for his la&s;t Behaviour, was &s;omewhat &s;oftened after her Di&s;cour&s;e with her Lord. She thought no longer of his &s;up|po&s;ed Neglect, &s;he only con&s;idered the Dan|gers he was going to expo&s;e him&s;elf to. And
<PB N="94" REF="95">
whenever &s;he met his Eyes, which now hap|pened more frequently than before, &s;he &s;aw &s;o much Grief and Tenderne&s;s painted in them, that &s;he conceived it would be inhu|man to deny him the Satisfaction of taking a particular Leave of her. She therefore no longer avoided him, as u&s;ual: And the&s;e two Lovers having now agreed to &s;peak to each other, it was not difficult for them to find an Opportunity. The Chevalier, who watched her Steps, &s;eeing her, the Evening before they were to &s;et out for <HI>Paris,</HI> walking alone in a covered Alley, he joined her with a re&s;pect|ful Air, and a Timidity which the late Di&s;co|very he had made, could not repre&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>I know not, Madam, (&s;aid he to her trem|bling) whether you will conde&s;cend to hear for a few Moments the mo&s;t unfortunate of Men; but I dare flatter my&s;elf, that if you knew the Sincerity of my Repentance for having di&s;plea&s;ed you, and all the Torments I have &s;uffered from that Time, your Heart, in&s;en&s;ible as it is, would be moved to pity me; but if you are &s;evere enough to think my Crime not &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed by your Rigour and my own Grief, Death, I hope, will &s;oon revenge you fully on a Wretch who has had the Audacity to offend you.

<Q>Chevalier, (replied the Counte&s;s, looking on him with Eyes in which Anger and Di&s;dain were wholly extingui&s;hed) let us &s;peak no more of what is pa&s;t, I am willing to for|get your Crime, and remember only your Repentance, and the Services my Father and my Brother have received from you: Live then, &s;ince I am &s;o far from wi&s;hing your Death, that I earne&s;tly conjure you to be careful of your&s;elf, do not expo&s;e your Life to inevitable Dangers.&mdash; I recommend my Hu&s;band and my Brother to your Care, be watchful over their Safety, and do not neglect your own. Yes, (continued &s;he in a Voice more tender) your Life is dear to me, I will not blu&s;h to own it.&mdash; I e&s;teem your Per&s;on, but do not imagine, that this Confe&s;&s;ion can authorize you to entertain any Hopes to the Prejudice of my Honour; it is innocent, though it is frank and with|out Di&s;gui&s;e; do you then take care to re|gulate your Conduct by it, as the Sentiments I have for you are not incon&s;i&s;tent with my Duty, and will be always guided by the &s;trict Rules of Virtue; let me hope, that your Behaviour will be &s;uch as &s;hall not give me Cau&s;e to retract them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97">The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> &s;topped at the&s;e Words, expecting her Lover's Reply, but the Chevalier was not compo&s;ed enough to make any for &s;ome Moments; he doubted whether what he had heard, was not an Illu&s;ion of his Sen&s;es. A Man who from extreme Mi&s;ery pa&s;&s;es rapidly to an Exce&s;s of good Fortune, could not be more tran&s;ported out of him&s;elf than the happy Chevalier in that &s;weet Mo|ment.</P>
<P>'Ah! Madam, (&s;aid he, with a Look, and Voice expre&s;&s;ive of the highe&s;t Agi|tation)
<Q>your unmerited Goodne&s;s is almo&s;t as fatal to me as your Rigour, my Heart, &s;o long tormented by Remor&s;e for having offended you, and Grief for having lo&s;t your E&s;teem, can with Difficulty bear the Tran&s;ports with which you have filled it by this A&s;&s;urance of your Pardon, and Pro|mi&s;e of your returning Favour; this over|pays me for all the Torments I have &s;uffer|ed, Torments that will ever be dear to me, &s;ince they have produced &s;uch happy Effects. Yes, Madam, I will endeavour to pre&s;erve my Life &s;ince you de&s;ire I &s;hould do &s;o, I will &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively obey your Commands, but will live only to love you with the mo&s;t pure di&s;intere&s;ted Affection, and to &s;erve you with the mo&s;t faithful Re&s;pect.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, Mon&s;ieur, returned the charming Counte&s;s, begin then by giving me convin|cing Proofs of the Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of your
<PB N="97" REF="98">
Affection. I love my Hu&s;band, and my Brother with the utmo&s;t Tenderne&s;s, again I tell you that I confide them to your ge|nerous Care, do not abandon them in the Danger to which their ra&s;h Courage may lead them, moderate their ardor and hinder them from expo&s;ing their Per&s;ons unnece&s;|&s;arily, bring them back to me again in Safety, pur&s;ued &s;he, letting fall &s;ome Tears from her fine Eyes, and be a&s;&s;ured that my con&s;tant E&s;teem, will be the Price of &s;uch a Service.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier was preparing to a&s;&s;ure the Counte&s;s that he would pay the mo&s;t exact Obedience to her Commands, when young <HI>Berci</HI> her Brother-in-law, appeared in the Walk, and interrupted the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Conver&s;ation he had ever known. How difficult is it for a Lover who has lately ex|perienced any unlooked for good Fortune, to conceal his Joy. The Chevalier at that Moment was hardly to be known, he was no more the &s;ame Man, plunged in Grief and wholly ab&s;orbed in Melancholy. The Satisfaction he felt, &s;hone in his Eyes, and enlivened his whole Countenance. His Con|ver&s;ation, freed from that Re&s;traint he had formerly laboured under, was now ea&s;y and chearful, and as they continued their Walk all three together, &s;ome lively Sallies e&s;caped him, which gave the Counte&s;s as good an Opinion of his Wit, as &s;he had of his Valour and Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">It was not difficult for the Count's Brother to gue&s;s the Cau&s;e of &s;o extraordinary a Change. He &s;uppo&s;ed his Si&s;ter-in-law had relaxed in her Severity to the Chevalier, and if he did not form Su&s;picions injurious to her Virtue, he concluded at lea&s;t that their Farewel had been very tender, and that they were well a&s;&s;ured of each other's Affection: how|ever he prudently di&s;&s;embled his Thoughts, and contented him&s;elf with ob&s;erving them carefully all the re&s;t of the Evening; the Lovers perceived it, and were more circum|&s;pect, but their Eyes often met, and to an intere&s;ted Ob&s;erver, could not fail, of betraying their &s;ecret Sentiments. The next Day was appointed for their Journey to <HI>Paris.</HI> The Parting between the Count and Counte&s;s, was extremely moving, they both &s;hed Tears, and probably the Chevalier had &s;ome Part in tho&s;e of Madam <HI>de Berci.</HI> He was not permitted to indulge his Grief with any outward Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of it, but his Eyes looked a thou&s;and tender Farewels, which the Counte&s;s could not but under&s;tand.</P>
<P>They arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> the &s;ame Night, and &s;tayed there &s;ome Days, to provide them&s;elves with Armour and all Things that were nece&s;|&s;ary for their Expedition; and after they had furni&s;hed them&s;elves with Letters of Exchange for <HI>Holland,</HI> they took Po&s;t for that Place; leaving Orders that their Equipages &s;hould follow them by ea&s;y Journies. They had the good Fortune to arrive eight Days before
<PB N="99" REF="100">
<HI>Rhineburg</HI> was inve&s;ted, which gave them Time to throw them&s;elves into the Town, that they might have Part in the glorious De|fence it made, during the three Months which the Siege of that important Place continued.</P>
<P>It does not enter into my De&s;ign, to de&s;cribe here, the Particulars of a Siege, which may be read at length, in the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Holland.</HI> I &s;hall only relate, what properly belongs to the Subject I am treating. The Be&s;ieged made &s;everal Sallies with great Advantage, in all which, our Voluntiers &s;ignali&s;ed them&s;elves, and were very much taken Notice of; but the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> gave &s;o many Proofs of his Courage, that he was looked upon as a Prodigy of Strength and Valour. Notwith|&s;tanding the Promi&s;es he made to his adored Counte&s;s, he was far from acting with Caution, he ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t Dangers, and ex|po&s;ed his Per&s;on in every Place, where mo&s;t Glory was to be acquired. No Man under|&s;tood the Art of War better than he did, he was particularly &s;killful in the Art of For|tification, and his Advice contributed great|ly to prolong the Defence of the Place. He might be &s;een upon the Ramparts like one of the Heroes of old, overturning all that made any Attempts to &s;cale them, and fearle&s;sly receiving upon his Buckler, the innumerable Stokes that were aimed at him. He was only attentive to the Pre&s;ervation of his two Friends, the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who&s;e Lives were more
<PB N="100" REF="101">
precious to him, than his own; he kept them always in his Sight, and never failed to bring them off in Safety, when their too great Ar|dour had carried them, in &s;pite of his Re|mon&s;trances, into Places where their Lives were mo&s;t expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Siege of <HI>Rhineburg</HI> had already la&s;ted two Months, by the uncommon Efforts of the Warriors who defended the Place, when it was re&s;olved that a new Sally &s;hould be made, from which they hoped for great Ad|vantages; a dreadful Mine being ordered to be &s;prung at the &s;ame Time to favour the Sally. Although our noble <HI>Frenchmen</HI> had been greatly fatigued with their pa&s;t Labours, yet they were determined not to mi&s;s this Op|portunity of gathering new Laurels. The Enemies, who did not expect this &s;udden Sal|ly, were at fir&s;t put into Di&s;order, and fled, but &s;oon rallying again, the Fight was re|newed with equal Fury, on both Sides: The Count of <HI>Berci's</HI> Brother ra&s;hly engaging him&s;elf too far from his own Party, was taken by the Enemies, the Chevalier not being near enough to prevent his Misfortune; but being informed of it, he re&s;olved, co&s;t what it would, to recover him; he overthrew all that oppo&s;ed his Pa&s;&s;age; and the Enemy's Troops, amazed at a Courage and Strength, which appeared to them more than human, dreaded him more than half the Garri&s;on. He had already &s;lain a great many with his own Hand, when he perceived that his dear Count was ju&s;t thrown
<PB N="101" REF="102">
on the Ground by a Grenadier with a Stroke of his Sword, which however had only &s;tun|ned him. The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> his Brother-in-law, was near him, but had enough to do to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the Blows that were aimed at him on all Sides. The Grenadier was ju&s;t going to take away the Life of the Count <HI>de Berci,</HI> if the Cheva|lier, who never one Moment forgot the Commands of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> had not flown to his Relief; he &s;truck down with one Blow the Grenadier, who was going to murder the Count, and after he had helped him up, they both joined to di&s;engage the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who was defend|ing him&s;elf alone again&s;t three fierce Enemies. They &s;oon got rid of them, and made a hor|rible Slaughter of &s;everal others, who met their Fury. The Signal for re-entering the Town being given, they obeyed with Regret, &s;till fighting as they retreated, and they were the la&s;t that entered, having brought off the Troops with great Glory and Succe&s;s. The Chevalier was more plea&s;ed with his good Fortune in having pre&s;erved his dear Friends, than with all the Prai&s;es that were given him by tho&s;e who had been Witne&s;&s;es of his Ac|tions. To have had it in his Power to do &s;ome Service to his beloved Counte&s;s, in the Per&s;ons of a Hu&s;band and Brother &s;o dear to her, gave him more Joy, than the Laurels he had gained with &s;o many Dangers, and with &s;uch loud Applau&s;e. However, they were all three greatly afflicted at the Misfortune
<PB N="102" REF="103">
that had happened to young <HI>Berci.</HI> A Trum|pet was &s;ent next Day to the General to de|&s;ire he might be treated with the Re&s;pect due to his Quality. His Captivity la&s;ted but a &s;hort Time; for he was &s;oon after exchanged for a Kin&s;man of the Marquis <HI>de Spinola's,</HI> who had been taken Pri&s;oner by the Be|&s;ieged.</P>
<P><HI>Rhineburg,</HI> had now heldout three Months, more through the Valour of the Be&s;ieged, than the Strength of the Place. The Go|vernour de&s;pairing of Succours, and growing de&s;titute of Provi&s;ion and Ammunition, de|manded a Capitulation. The vigourous D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|fence he had made, was alike glorious to him, and advantageous for his Party; for it effectually hindered the Enemies from un|dertaking any thing con&s;iderable during the Remainder of the Campaign. The Enemies, doing Ju&s;tice to his Valour and good Con|duct, allowed him very honourable Condi|tions. Our Voluntiers finding that the Sea|&s;on was far advanced, and that they were not likely to have any more Opportunities of &s;ignali&s;ing them&s;elves, took the Road back to <HI>Paris,</HI> making &s;hort Journies. But it is now Time to &s;ee how the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> employed her&s;elf during the Ab&s;ence of her Lord.</P>
<P>A few Days after his Departure from <HI>Beau|plan,</HI> &s;he &s;et out for <HI>Burgundy,</HI> with two of her Women, and a Gentleman whom the
<PB N="103" REF="104">
Count had left to attend her. She &s;topped at an Inn at <HI>Auxerre,</HI> and as &s;he entered the Hou&s;e, &s;aw a young Lady, who &s;eemed to be ju&s;t alighted al&s;o, &s;tanding at the Window. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> thought her extremely hand|&s;ome, and was de&s;irous of having the Plea&s;ure of her Company during the Time they &s;taid there, &s;he &s;ent to beg the Favour they might dine together. The young Lady gladly ac|cepted the Invitation, and entering the Coun|te&s;s's Apartment, both were plea&s;ingly &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee each other: for in effect, this young Lady, whom the Counte&s;s did not know at a Di&s;tance, was Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI>&mdash; with whom the young Mar|quis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> was in Love.</P>
<P>They embraced with mutual Satisfaction; and, after the fir&s;t Compliments, each a&s;ked the other, where &s;he was travelling? and were infinitely plea&s;ed to find that great Part of their Journey they might be together. After Dinner they were informed, that their Coaches were ready, but the Counte&s;s in&s;i&s;ted upon Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin's</HI> coming into her's, their Women being all accommodated in the young Lady's Coach, Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> and &s;he had the Plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing toge|ther without Re&s;traint.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had left <HI>Auxerre,</HI> the Coun|te&s;s informed Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> of the Occa&s;ion of this Journey, &s;he told her, that in the Company of her Father and Mo|ther,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
&s;he was going to &s;eek &s;ome Con&s;olation, for the Grief which her Lord's and her Bro|ther's Ab&s;ence had given her, who, &s;he ad|ded, were gone to make a Campaign in <HI>Hol|land.</HI> Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> knew this as well as the Counte&s;s; for the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> had both wrote to her before their Departure from <HI>Beauplan,</HI> to inform her of their intended Ex|pedition, and to take their Leaves of her. She was almo&s;t as much afflicted as the Counte&s;s, and was going into the Country to bewail her Lover's Ab&s;ence, and to conceal the In|tere&s;t &s;he took in it. However, &s;he affected to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the News, expre&s;&s;ing a great E&s;teem for the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur,</HI> had &s;he &s;aid Love, &s;he would but have done Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e Sentiments &s;he felt for him; but on &s;uch Occa&s;ions young Ladies generally &s;hew, they can be very &s;ecret. And, indeed, &s;he had di&s;&s;embled her Thoughts with &s;o much Art, that neither the Marquis, or Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> had ever Rea&s;on to flat|ter him&s;elf with being prefered. To this Conduct of her's was owing the Di&s;pute which terminated in their Duel at <HI>Fontainebleau</HI>; for each &s;uppo&s;ing the other more happy than him&s;elf, both were enraged, and thought them&s;elves injured.</P>
<P>However, Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> was not quite &s;o re&s;erved with the Si&s;ter of her favourite Lover: for though &s;he would not confe&s;s, that &s;he loved the Marquis <HI>de
<PB N="105" REF="106">
Saint-Sauveur,</HI> yet &s;he acknowledged, with a graceful Mode&s;ty, that, notwith&s;tanding Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> had great Merit, yet he would never be her Choice. This was enough to a&s;&s;ure the Counte&s;s, who did not want Pe|netration, that one Lover was rejected, in Fa|vour of the other: She knew her Sex too well, to expect a farther Explanation, from one &s;o mode&s;t as Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmar|tin</HI>; and &s;en&s;ible how obliging &s;uch an Decla|mation was for her Brother, &s;he only an&s;wer|ed it by tender Care&s;&s;es, to &s;hew that &s;he un|der&s;tood it &s;o.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle de <HI>Montmartin</HI> was ab&s;olute|ly ignorant of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ar's</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s, as well as the great E&s;teem &s;he had for him. They di&s;cour&s;ed about the Duel between the Rivals; Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmantin</HI> prai&s;ed the Valour and Genero&s;ity of the Chevalier, in very high Terms; and the Counte&s;s was not &s;orry, that &s;he had an Op|portunity of talking of him, both of them had great Obligations to him. No Conver&s;a|tion is &s;o delightful as that on a beloved Ob|ject. The&s;e Ladies &s;ufficiently proved the Truth of that Ob&s;ervation; for the Count, the Chevalier and the Marquis afforded them a Subject &s;o copious, that, although they talked of nothing el&s;e during that Day's Journey, yet when they came to part at Night, they &s;eemed to have a great deal more to &s;ay. The Counte&s;s and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> embraced each other tenderly, and vowed an
<PB N="106" REF="107">
inviolable Friend&s;hip. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> pro|mi&s;ed to be in <HI>Paris</HI> at the Expiration of two Months, from whence &s;he did not intend to remove till her Lord's Arrival: Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> on her Side a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he would join her there about that Time, and intreated her to write to her frequently, promi&s;ing to be as punctual as po&s;&s;ible in her An&s;wers.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> continuing her Jour|ney, arrived three Days afterwards at her Father's E&s;tate, where &s;he was received with the highe&s;t Te&s;timonies of Joy. Her Mother, who had not &s;een her &s;ince her Marriage, held her a long Time embraced in her Arms, bedewing her fair Face, with Tears of Tender|ne&s;s and Delight. Madame <HI>de Berci,</HI> as &s;oon as the&s;e fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of their Meeting were &s;ub&s;ided, acquainted her Parents with her Lord's and her Brother's Departure to <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and that it was the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> who had per&s;uaded them to this Expedition, to which &s;he had been obliged to con&s;ent.</P>
<P><Q>God grant, &s;aid the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> with lifted Eyes, that their &s;afe Return may put an End to your Fears and ours. My Daughter, added the good old Man, you recal to my Remembrance a Man who will ever be dear to me, his Wel|fare, next to that of my Wife and Children, is what I take mo&s;t Intere&s;t in. I dread le&s;t his immoderate Courage &s;hould expo&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="108">
him to Dangers no human Force can &s;ur|mount; for all that Man can do, he can, he &s;aved my Life once by his Valour, and he &s;aved it a &s;econd time, by pre&s;erving your Brother, it will never be in my Power to make him a &s;ufficient Return for Bene|fits of this Nature.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s dur&s;t not tru&s;t her&s;elf &s;o far as to an&s;wer this Di&s;cour&s;e of her Father's, &s;he dreaded le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;ay too much on &s;o plea&s;ing a Subject, &s;he therefore artfully turned the Conver&s;ation upon her meeting with Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> at <HI>Au|xerre.</HI> She extolled the Merit and Beauty of that young Lady, and expre&s;&s;ed an ardent Wi&s;h, that &s;he might be &s;o happy as to have her for a Si&s;ter-in-law. The old Marquis, who knew her Family, as al&s;o that &s;he had a very large Fortune, a Quality which in tho&s;e Times, as well as our own, was of higher E&s;timation than all the Advantages of Wit, Birth, and Beauty, was extremely well &s;atis|fied with his Son's Ta&s;te, and approved of his Daughter's Propo&s;al, declaring that her E&s;tate was a very good one, and &s;he was a very ami|able Lady.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who took every Opportunity of writing to his Wife, and &s;ending her News of every Thing that concerned him, informed her of his Bro|ther's being taken Pri&s;oner by the Enemies, and the Extremity to which he him&s;elf and
<PB N="108" REF="109">
his Brother-in-law would have been reduced, but for the immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance they received from the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> He acknow|ledged, that he owed his Life to the Courage of that brave Man, and that he had al&s;o pre|&s;erved the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> a &s;econd time. The Count gave a very circum&s;tan|tial Account of the Danger they had been in, and of the Valour and Conduct of his Friend, who by a thou&s;and brave Exploits, had gained a never dying Reputation. He intreated his Wife to be at <HI>Paris</HI> in a few Days, where he hoped he &s;hould &s;oon meet her.</P>
<P><Q>No, my dear Daughter, &s;aid her Mother tran&s;ported with Admiration and Gratitude, the Count mu&s;t come and fetch you; write to him to bring with him this wonderful Man. This is the only Way we have to &s;ee him; he is &s;o great a Friend of your Lord's, that he will not refu&s;e to accompany him to <HI>Burgundy.</HI> We will &s;hew him by our Re|ception of him, that although it is not in our Power to repay the ine&s;timable Benefits he has conferred upon us, yet that we can acknowledge them with the utmo&s;t Grati|tude.</Q>
The Counte&s;s could not but be ve|ry much affected with this new Proof of the Chevalier's Pa&s;&s;ion for her, her Delicacy was not &s;hocked at the grateful Tenderne&s;s &s;he felt for a Man who had pre&s;erved her Hu&s;band. His Genero&s;ity, and the Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his Love, &s;eemed to authori&s;e tho&s;e favourable Sentiments &s;he had for him. The Prai&s;es her
<PB N="109" REF="110">
Father and Mother be&s;towed upon him, &s;trengthened tho&s;e Sentiments; and it was with Difficulty that &s;he forbore joining in their Eulogiums on this brave Man, with an Ardour that might have betrayed her Secret. She reflected with A&s;toni&s;hment on the &s;trange Effects of Fortune, which continually furni&s;h|ed him with new Arms, to take, as it were, her Heart by Force. She became &s;en&s;ible, at length, that &s;he loved the Chevalier.&mdash; A Crime, which, though involuntary, &s;he would not have pardoned in her&s;elf, had &s;he not re|&s;olved to die, rather than do any thing that could wound her Duty, or throw a Blemi&s;h upon her Fame.</P>
<P>After &s;he had continued &s;ome Weeks at her Father's, &s;he had Affairs to &s;olicit at Court, which required that &s;he &s;hould be there, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The Marquis and his La|dy u&s;ed a thou&s;and Efforts to detain her, with a Hope of having &s;oon the Company of their Son-in-law, and the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars</HI>; but the Counte&s;s could not be prevail|ed upon. &mdash; Although the Care of her Affairs had indeed le&s;s Part in her Eagerne&s;s to be gone, than her Impatience to meet her Lord, and perhaps a &s;ecret Wi&s;h to &s;ee the Cheva|lier; be&s;ides, &s;he had promi&s;ed Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> to be at <HI>Paris</HI> within two Months, and the Time drew very near, that young Lady was already there, and had wrote to the Counte&s;s to remind her of her Pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> took a tender Farewel of her Parents, who believing they &s;aw her for the la&s;t time, were di&s;&s;olved in Tears and Grief; the Counte&s;s was not le&s;s afflicted, and with Dif|ficulty di&s;engaging her&s;elf from their Arms, &s;he threw her&s;elf into her Coach in a &s;ilent Agony of Grief.</P>
<P>Having met with no Accidents or Delays in her Journey, &s;he arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> on the tenth of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>She employed all the remaining Part of the Time her Lord continued at the Siege of <HI>Rhineburg,</HI> in &s;oliciting the Affair &s;he had at Court. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> hardly ever left her, nothing could be more tender and &s;incere, than the Friend&s;hip between the&s;e two Ladies. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> felt the Ab&s;ence of the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> le&s;s &s;evere, when &s;he was in the Company of his charming Si&s;ter, and Ma|dam <HI>de Berci</HI> could indulge her Tenderne&s;s by talking of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> who con&s;idering him as the Pre&s;erver of her Lover's Life, was ne|ver tired of hearing his Prai&s;es.</P>
<P>The Ladies had Lodgings near the Ar&s;enal, where the young Nobility diverted them&s;elves every Day with Tilting, and other martial Sports, and the&s;e bloodle&s;s Wars were often a plea&s;ing Amu&s;ement to them. One Day they were informed, that &s;ome Foreigners, who

were ju&s;t arrived at <HI>Paris,</HI> had challenged &s;ome of the Courtiers to break a Lance with them, as was the Cu&s;tom in the gallant Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. The King, who &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e Foreigners to be <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> a Nation he had a high E&s;teem for, re&s;olved to honour this Combat with his Pre&s;ence, the whole Court came to the Ar&s;enal, and our two Friends did not fail likewi&s;e to be there. The Foreigners made good their Challenge a long Time again&s;t &s;everal Lords of the Court, but one among&s;t them &s;oon drew all the Attention of the Spectators. He gave &s;o many Proofs of an uncommon Courage, and Addre&s;s, that one of the brave&s;t Men of the Court, and a great Favourite of the King's, flattering him&s;elf, that he could revenge the Defeat of the other Lords, by overcoming his Vanqui&s;her, ad|vanced fiercely again&s;t him, however, he had &s;oon Cau&s;e to repent of his Pre&s;umption, for after &s;everal vigourous Efforts to overthrow his Adver&s;ary, the Stranger, weary of a Re|&s;i&s;tance to which he had not been accu&s;tomed, collecting all his Strength, gave him &s;o fu|rious a Blow that he fell groveling on the Ground.</P>
<P>The Courtier was &s;lightly wounded by the Lance; and although the King was &s;oon in|formed that his Hurt was not dangerous, yet he was &s;o much concerned at an Accident &s;o mortifying for his Favourite, that he com|manded the Sports &s;hould cea&s;e; and &s;ending for the Challengers, de&s;ired they would make
<PB N="112" REF="113">
them&s;elves known. They obeyed, with a profound Reverence to the King, and taking off their ca&s;ques, di&s;covered to him that they were his own Subjects.</P>
<P>The King and the whole Court &s;oon knew them to be the &s;ame brave Men who three Months before had left <HI>Paris,</HI> to go and &s;hut them&s;elves up in <HI>Rhineburg,</HI> and indeed they were no other, than the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and his two noble Friends; they had arrived that very Day from <HI>Holland,</HI> and had agreed to &s;ignalize their Entry into <HI>Paris,</HI> by &s;ome gallant Adventure.</P>
<P>The King was extremely plea&s;ed to &s;ee them again, and was better &s;atisfied that his Favourite and his Courtiers &s;hould be over|come by their own Countrymen, than Foreigners. He &s;aid a great many obliging Things upon their Valour and Succe&s;s; and after conferring with them upon &s;ome Parti|culars relating to the Siege of <HI>Rhineburg,</HI> and declaring that he was highly plea&s;ed with their Conduct, he returned to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> and left them in the mid&s;t of the Ladies.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Prai&s;es that were given to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> re&s;ounded from every Part, and had Glory been the predominant Pa&s;&s;ion in his Soul, he might have been extremely happy; but he was wholly taken up with the Thoughts of his lovely Counte&s;s, whom he was every where
<PB N="113" REF="114">
&s;eeking with his Eyes. The Impatience that was vi&s;ible in his Countenance, and that Ab|&s;ence of Mind, which made him in&s;en&s;ible to every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, had there been Lei|&s;ure for Ob&s;ervation, might have betrayed his Secret. At length he di&s;covered the Place where Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was, he pointed her out with a joyful Emotion to the Count, and they immediately advanced to &s;alute her, while the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> flew eagerly to ki&s;s the Hands of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> who was with her; that young Lady was in great Per|plexity how to behave in &s;uch a manner to the&s;e Rivals, as might not excite the Jealou&s;y of either, by a Preference too remarkable. And though her Heart declared for the Mar|quis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> yet &s;he received Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> with equal Appearance of Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> having embraced the Counte&s;s his Wife, pre&s;ented the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to her, and ca&s;ting a tender Regard upon him, &s;aid,
<Q>Madam, it is to this brave Man, this truly generous Friend, that you owe the &s;afe Return of your Hu&s;band, and your Brother; to him we are obliged for the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing you again. Pay your Acknowledgments here, and by your grateful Reception of our Pre&s;erver, &s;hew your E&s;timation of the Benefits he has con|ferred upon you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115"><Q>It is not the only time, replied the Coun|te&s;s, &s;weetly blu&s;hing, that the Chevalier, by the Greatne&s;s of his Services to us, has made all Thanks poor, and infinitely below the Obligations we have to him; and if it is not in our Power to repay &s;uch noble Acts, with any thing farther than &s;uch Sen|timents as the highe&s;t Gratitude in&s;pires, he will, like Heaven, be contented with Thanks and Prai&s;e, &s;ince Virtue is always its own greate&s;t Reward.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier under&s;tood the full Force of this An&s;wer, which probably the Count might think a little extravagant.
<Q>Madam, an|&s;wered he, the Services I have been &s;o hap|py as to render you, are only con&s;iderable with re&s;pect to their Motive, and their Ob|jects and to which Fortune has contributed more than any thing el&s;e: but were they much greater than they are, I &s;hould think them too well rewarded, by the Honour you do me, of appearing &s;en&s;ible of them.</Q></P>
<P>The Count, during this Speech, had been making his Compliments to Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI>; and the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur</HI> then found Time to &s;alute his Si&s;ter, and to pre&s;ent Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> to her; after which the Count giving his Hand to the young Lady, while the Chevalier had the Happine&s;s of leading the charming Counte&s;s, they went altogether to Madam <HI>de Berci's</HI> Lodgings,
<PB N="115" REF="116">
which were but a &s;mall Di&s;tance from thence.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s detained Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> to Supper, as likewi&s;e &s;ome other Ladies, her Friends, who being informed of the Count's Return, came to take Part in her Joy. After Supper, &s;everal of the Count's Friends coming in, the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> left him among&s;t them, and joined the Ladies, who had formed a little Cabal by them&s;elves. The Di&s;cour&s;e now turned wholly upon Gal|lantry: One of the Ladies, who had a great deal of Vivacity, a&s;ked the Chevalier, if In|&s;en&s;ibility was the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of uncommon Courage; and whether Love and Glory were incompatible?
<Q>To tell you the Truth, added &s;he, we are all very unhappy, to find that our Charms have yet made no Impre&s;&s;ion upon your Heart. And &s;ince, as we find by your Example, that Hero's are &s;en&s;ible to no other Pa&s;&s;ion but Ambi|tion, we are in Danger of having either no Adorers at all, or &s;uch as will do us no Honour.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s and the Chevalier could not help &s;miling, at this Speech. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> finding the Chevalier &s;ilent, turned to the Lady, who had made the At|tack upon him.
<Q>We find, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, that the Hero's of old were proud of &s;urrendering their Arms to Love, and tho&s;e Laurels they had gained with &s;uch Danger
<PB N="116" REF="117">
in the Field, were generally offered to &s;ome Fair ones, at their Return; why then &s;hould you imagine that the Chevalier would think Love a Blemi&s;h to his Glory, when they imagined it added Glory to theirs. As for me, I declare, I believe him to be as much in Love as any of tho&s;e great Men, but infinitely more di&s;creet; and his great Care, to conceal his Flame, from all Eyes but tho&s;e which have kindled it, is a Proof with me, that it is &s;o much the more vio|lent and la&s;ting.</Q></P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> would not have railled the Chevalier in this manner, had &s;he had the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of his Pa&s;|&s;ion for the Counte&s;s; &s;he had no other De&s;ign in it, but to keep up the Mirth of the Conver&s;ation. The Counte&s;s knew not what to think, when the Chevalier recover|ing a little from the Perplexity into which this Di&s;cour&s;e had thrown him, &s;aid,
<Q>If there is no Heart, Madam, but what &s;ome Time or other is &s;en&s;ible of the Force of Love, mine, if it had kept its Freedom hitherto, would certainly lo&s;e it now, amid&s;t &s;o many Charms; but grant I am in Love, what would it avail me to confe&s;s a Flame for which I cannot hope for any Re|medy?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Perhaps, Mon&s;ieur, &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> the Beauty for whom you langui&s;h in &s;ecret, wants only &s;uch a Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="117" REF="118">
to make her pity, and reward your Love.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was now more alarmed than before, and apprehen&s;ive that her Silence might make it &s;u&s;pected that &s;he was too much intere&s;ted in this Di&s;cour&s;e, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the Chevalier, with an Air &s;o un|re&s;erved and ea&s;y, as might have blinded the mo&s;t penetrating View.'</P>
<P><Q>If I was acquainted with this haughty Beauty, Mon&s;ieur, &s;aid &s;he, and was a&s;|&s;ured that I had any Influence over her, I would never cea&s;e to importune her, till &s;he had rendered Ju&s;tice to your Valour and Merit. I am per&s;uaded, the re&s;t of the&s;e Ladies are as much inclined to fa|vour you, and would readily join their Endeavours with mine to &s;erve you. If then you would make u&s;e of our A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, you mu&s;t tell us the Name of this powerful Beauty, who has had the Glo|ry to triumph over &s;uch a Heart, that we may all plead your Cau&s;e, my&s;elf parti|cularly, in Acknowledgment for the Ser|vices I have received from you.</Q></P>
<P>It was plain, the Counte&s;s relied greatly on the Chevalier's Wit and Di&s;cretion, or &s;he could not have gone &s;o far; he an&s;wer|ed her Expectations, and taking the Word, with a Grace that &s;uffered not any Embar|ra&s;sment to be perceived,
<Q>Madam, &s;aid
<PB N="118" REF="119">
he, there is &s;o great a Di&s;proportion be|tween the Merit of the Lady I love, and my own, that I dare not hope for any Re|turn to my Pa&s;&s;ion. However, I am &s;o highly obliged by the Offer you have gene|rou&s;ly made me, and I owe you &s;o much Re&s;pect and Obedience, that, although I had determined not to di&s;clo&s;e her Name, yet if you command me, I will reveal it to you, upon Condition, that you will pro|mi&s;e me, Madam, never to di&s;cover the Secret.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible to accept of your Condi|tion, interrupted the Counte&s;s &s;miling, how little do you under&s;tand our Sex, if you think we would not rather lo&s;e the Plea&s;ure of hearing a Secret, than be under the hor|rible Re&s;traint of keeping it; but I believe, continued &s;he, that we have really carried our Curio&s;ity too far. &mdash; It would be inhu|man to rally you any more, and we will content our&s;elves, with knowing that you are in Love, without de&s;iring you to name the Object.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier made no Reply, but taking up a Lute that lay upon a Table, he touched the Strings with &s;uch Art, as &s;hewed he was a perfect Ma&s;ter of that In&s;trument, and joining to it his Voice, he &s;ung a melting Air, which expre&s;&s;ed all the Fervour of his Pa&s;&s;ion. The Company, drawn by the Sweet|ne&s;s of his Voice, began to gather round
<PB N="119" REF="120">
him. &mdash; The Ladies, who remarked the Pur|port of the Song, which lamented a hopele&s;s Love, and &s;aw his Eyes &s;wimming in tender Langui&s;hment, &s;ighing at every Pau&s;e with &s;ympathetic Sorrow, were per&s;uaded that he was indeed a Lover, and that he was unfor|tunate.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was &s;o affected with this mu&s;ical Complaint, which &s;he under&s;tood perfectly well, that it was with Difficulty &s;he re&s;trained her Tears, and not daring to meet her Lover's Eyes with &s;o much Softne&s;s in her own, &s;he turned them on her Lord, cal|ling up all her Virtue and her Fortitude to re&s;i&s;t the &s;oft Emotions, that filled her Brea&s;t. The Chevalier had &s;carce ended his Song, when a Page entered the Room, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. He ro&s;e up, and Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> who followed him with her Eyes, &s;aw that the Page delivered a Me&s;&s;age to him in a Whi&s;per, after which the Chevalier, making an Excu&s;e to the Company for leaving them, followed the little Emi&s;&s;ary down Stairs.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s found &s;omething in this my&s;terious Me&s;&s;age, &s;ufficient to alarm her, &s;he &s;u&s;pected it was &s;ome Lady who had &s;ent for the Chevalier. That Love, which had lain hid even from her&s;elf at the Bottom of her Heart, flamed out in Jealou&s;y at this In|cident; &s;he felt Emotions which hitherto &s;he had been a Stranger to, a deadly Palena&s;s
<PB N="120" REF="121">
over&s;pread her Face, &s;he trembled, &s;ighed, and e'er &s;he was aware the Tears &s;tarted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om her Eyes. Such extraordinary Agita|&s;ions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have awakened the Company's Su&s;picions, had not the Accident that happened at that very In&s;tant, given a Colour to it, by the general Terror and Grief with which all were &s;eized.</P>
<P>The Chevalier having, as we have already &s;aid, followed the Page down Stairs, he ru&s;h|ed &s;uddenly out of the Door that led to the Street, and three Men advancing immediate|ly to the Chevalier, &s;eized him, and plunged their Poignards into his Body. The Cheva|lier di&s;engaging him&s;elf from their hold, drew his Sword to defend him&s;elf, but e'er he could execute his Intentions, he received another Wound, which depriving him at once of Sen&s;e and Motion, he fell to the Ground. The A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;uppo&s;ing him dead, endeavour|ed to e&s;cape by the Door through which the Page had run out, and which, as they ex|pected, he had left open for them; but the Boy in his Hurry and Confu&s;ion flung the Door after him, &s;o that the Murderers found them&s;elves enclo&s;ed on every Side. The Noi&s;e the Chevalier had made by &s;trugling with them, reached the Ears of &s;ome Servants, who waited in the Antichamber, near that the Company were in, they ran ha&s;tily down Stairs, and came ju&s;t Time enough to &s;ee the Chevalier fall all bloody upon the Ground. One of them running up Stairs again, entered
<PB N="121" REF="122">
the Room where the Company was, and told them that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> had ju&s;t been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> followed by his Brother, and Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and <HI>Morigny,</HI> ran with their Swords drawn to the Hall: they found their Friend bathed in his own Blood, and lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the Ground, and the three Murderers, who en|deavoured to conceal them&s;elves, &s;tanding in a Corner of the Hall. The&s;e Wretches, &s;ee|ing the imminent Danger they were in, and that they could hope for no Mercy, &s;ought like Madmen; the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> called to them to yield, but finding them ob&s;tinate, he and his two Friends &s;oon di&s;patched them. Two of them died upon the Spot, and the third lived a few Moments after he fell, but could not be prevailed upon to declare who he was, and upon what Account he had joined in &s;o villainous an Action.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e was full of Tumult and Di&s;or|der; the Count's Servants, having taken up the Chevalier, carried him without Reflexion into the Room where the Ladies were; they laid him on a Sopha, and ran to fetch Sur|geons. &mdash; What a &s;ad Spectacle was this for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> her Lover pale, bloody, and disfigured with Wounds! She &s;tood gazing for a Moment upon him, her Eyes &s;eemed fixed, her Feet rooted to the Ground; then with a deep Groan &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s into
<PB N="122" REF="123">
the Arms of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> who was near her, and was carried into an|other Room, where all the Remedies they applied to recover her, were for &s;ome Time ineffectual.</P>
<P>The Surgeons in the mean time examined the Chevalier's Wounds, they pronounced them very dangerous; they conferred toge|ther a few Moments in a Language unintel|ligible to any but them&s;elves, and then pro|ceeded to apply their Dre&s;&s;ings, declaring, that if the Chevalier recovered, it would be little le&s;s than a Prodigy. His Friends li&s;ten|ed to this as to the Sentence of his Death, and abandoned them&s;elves to exce&s;&s;ive Grief. The Chevalier was put to Bed, and continued all the re&s;t of the Night in a Swoon. To|wards the Morning he began to recover his Sen&s;es, but his Voice was &s;o low that he could &s;carce be heard when he attempted to &s;peak. He had lo&s;t a great Quantity of Blood, and with it all Remembrance of what had happened to him. The Surgeons, who vi&s;ited him as &s;oon as it was light, ordered that he &s;hould not be allowed to &s;ee any Per|&s;on, or to &s;peak, but be kept as quiet as po&s;|&s;ible. His Friends, amid&s;t their Anxiety for his Recovery, u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavours to find out the Authors of &s;o horrid a Villany. After a &s;trict Enquiry, they di&s;covered the Page, who had brought the Me&s;&s;age to the Chevalier, and delivered him up to his But|chers. He confe&s;&s;ed, that he and tho&s;e Men
<PB N="123" REF="124">
had been employed by a Kin&s;man of the King's Favourite, who had been unhor&s;ed in the Li&s;ts by the Chevalier the &s;ame Day he came to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Friends of Mon&s;ieur <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> full of Indignation, and breathing Revenge, went to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> to complain of this A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion to the King, and to demand Ju&s;tice on the Author of it. It was but too probable, that the Favourite him&s;elf, who was likewi&s;e vanqui&s;hed by the Chevalier, was concerned in this black Affair; however, he di&s;avowed it publicly, and &s;hewed great Concern for the Condition to which the Chevalier was re|duced. His Grief, whether real or affected, had &s;uch Marks of Sincerity in it, as per&s;uaded the King he was ab&s;olutely ignorant of the horrid Deed, and being charmed at &s;uch a Conviction of his Innocence, he obliged him, and the Friends of the Chevalier, to embrace in his Pre&s;ence, commanding them po&s;itively to take no other Mea&s;ures to revenge him than tho&s;e the Law allows.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Favourite's Kin&s;man &s;ought to &s;ecure his own Safety by Flight: He went into another Country, and never more dur&s;t venture to return to <HI>France.</HI> But although the Favourite was ju&s;tified in the King's Opi|nion, yet the Public had not the &s;ame Indul|gence for him, nor equal Facility in believing his Profe&s;&s;ions. The Chevalier had never had any declared Enemy, and it was the general
<PB N="124" REF="125">
Di&s;cour&s;e, that the fal&s;e Shame of being van|qui&s;hed, had induced him to commit an Ac|tion &s;o infamous and &s;o unworthy of a brave Man.</P>
<P>But let us now return to the unfortunate Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci:</HI> When &s;he had recovered her Sen&s;es, and began to reflect on what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he found &s;he had given very remark|able Te&s;timonies of her Grief and Tenderne&s;s before &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es, all of whom &s;he could not flatter her&s;elf were &s;o taken up with their own Terror and Concern, as not to ob|&s;erve them. She trembled at the Interpreta|tion her Lord might put upon her Behaviour; but the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who tenderly loved his Wife, and who had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of her Virtue, attributed her &s;udden Fainting to the Terrors with which &s;he was &s;eized at the Sight of the Chevalier in that dreadful Condition; and it was natural for her to be extremely afflicted for the Danger of one from whom &s;he had received &s;o many Ser|vices.</P>
<P>He was the fir&s;t to tell her that the Sur|geons had &s;ome Hopes of his Recovery; &s;he was overjoyed at this News, but the Appre|hen&s;ions &s;he &s;till continued to be under, that her Regard for the Chevalier was di&s;covered, embittered that Joy, and filled her with An|xiety. She dreaded le&s;t her Brother-in-law &s;hould form Su&s;picions injurious to her Vir|tue. He, indeed, was but too well acquainted
<PB N="125" REF="126">
with the Chevalier's Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s' and did not fail to ob&s;erve the Conduct of them both. His Si&s;ter-in-law's Fainting did not e&s;cape his Notice; but whatever were his Thoughts about it, he kept them &s;hut up in his Heart, and never took any Step that might give her Unea&s;ine&s;s, or prejudice her in the Opinion of her Hu&s;band, and notwith&s;tand|ing his &s;ecret Envy of the Chevalier, he al|ways governed him&s;elf by tho&s;e Principles of Genero&s;ity which were natural to him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Chevalier was able to re|flect upon the Adventure which had happen|ed to him, he employed his Mind ince&s;&s;ant|ly in con&s;idering who could be the Author of it: And as Lovers are ever torturing them|&s;elves with imaginary Evils, he &s;ometimes fancied, that this &s;ecret Enemy, who &s;ought to take his Life, by &s;uch &s;hameful Methods, was a Rival, who flattered him&s;elf that it was he only who &s;tood in his Way to Hap|pine&s;s. This Thought gave him inexpre&s;|&s;ible Agonies; he burnt with De&s;ire to be revenged, and Impatience and the Inquietude of his Mind greatly retarded his Recovery.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who came into his Chamber, one Day, when he was mo&s;t di&s;|turbed with the&s;e Chimera's, finding his Fe|ver much higher, and hearing him &s;igh, and di&s;cover great Agitation of Mind:
<Q>What is it that troubles you, my dear Chevalier? (&s;aid this tender and faithful Friend) Why
<PB N="126" REF="127">
do you give way to any anxious Thoughts in the Condition you are in? The Melan|choly that oppre&s;&s;es you, will be of dan|gerous Con&s;equence to your Health, and the Hopes the Surgeons have given us of your Life, will be all bla&s;ted, if you do not, by calming your Mind, contribute to your Cure. Bani&s;h the&s;e Cares that di&s;turb your own Quiet, and afflict your Friends, and be a&s;&s;ured that you are already re|venged of your Enemies, if that Thought can give you any Relief.</Q></P>
<P>The Count then informed him of the Fate of his three A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, but took Care not to own his Su&s;picions concerning the King's Favourite, whom he had vanqui&s;hed in the Li&s;ts the Day he arrived at <HI>Paris.</HI> He was afraid, that he would too &s;oon be led, by common Di&s;cour&s;e, and his own Reflexions, to &s;u&s;pect him him&s;elf, and knowing the Courage of his Friend, he did not doubt but as &s;oon as he had recovered his Strength, he would take Vengeance on him for the ba&s;e Attempt he had made upon his Life.</P>
<P>The Chevalier would have an&s;wered the Count, and expre&s;&s;ed his Acknowledgment of the Friend&s;hip he di&s;covered for him, but Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> laying his Hand up|on his Mouth, conjured him to obey the Surgeons Directions, who had earne&s;tly re|commended to him not to &s;peak; and ten|derly urged him to contribute all in his
<PB N="127" REF="128">
Power towards his Cure, which was earne&s;t|ly prayed for by his Friends. The Cheva|lier then contented him&s;elf with pre&s;&s;ing in an affectionate manner the Count's Hand, which he held between his, endeavouring, by this Action, to &s;hew him how greatly he was affected with all tho&s;e In&s;tances he gave him of his Friend&s;hip. He ardently wi&s;hed to &s;ee the Counte&s;s; &mdash; her Pre&s;ence would have been an effectual Relief to him, but &s;he was of a contrary Opinion: She was afraid that the Sight of her might produce &s;ome dangerous Alteration, &s;he therefore con|tented her&s;elf with &s;ending frequent Me&s;&s;ages to know the State of his Health, and to a&s;|&s;ure him of the great Intere&s;t &s;he took in it.</P>
<P>At the Expiration of fifteen Days, the Surgeons declared that he was out of Danger, and that they would an&s;wer for his Life. The Count, eager to communi|cate this good News to his Wife, went in|&s;tantly to her Apartment, and congratulated his Brother and her, upon the hoped-for Recovery of a Friend &s;o dear to them all. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> could re&s;i&s;t no longer the earne&s;t De&s;ire &s;he had to &s;ee him, but &s;till fearful of &s;urpri&s;ing him, &s;he &s;ent to let him know that &s;he would vi&s;it him the next Day. This Interval appeared an Age to the tran&s;ported Chevalier, he counted the Hours with Impatience, and ble&s;&s;ed every fleeting

Moment as it pa&s;t, which brought him nearer to his Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> accompanied the Counte&s;s in this Vi&s;it; but they, glad of an Opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e together apart, re|tired to one End of the Room, as &s;oon as they had paid their Compliments to the Che|valier, and left the Counte&s;s alone at his Bed|&s;ide. The Chevalier, at the Sight of her, whom he loved with &s;uch Ardency, forgot his Wounds and his Pain; he attempted to rai&s;e him&s;elf in his Bed, that he might, in a le&s;s unbecoming Po&s;ture, thank her for the Honour &s;he did him. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> perceiving his Intention, made a Motion with her Hand to hinder him. The happy Chevalier immediately &s;eized that charming Hand, and the Counte&s;s not having Re&s;olu|tion enough to withdraw it at fir&s;t, he printed an ardent Ki&s;s upon it, but again offering to pre&s;s it to his Lips, &s;he drew it back with Precipitation, though with no Marks of Anger; and this mute Conver&s;ation gave place to Acknowledgements on the Part of the Chevalier, and Prote&s;tations of eternal Gratitude and Re&s;pect for her unmerited Goodne&s;s; but all uttered with &s;uch appa|rent Di&s;order, and in Language &s;o uncon|nected, as per&s;uaded the Counte&s;s of the Fervour of his Love, better than the mo&s;t eloquent Di&s;cour&s;e could have done. She a&s;&s;ured him, on her Side, that &s;he had been
<PB N="129" REF="130">
really afflicted at the Misfortune which had happened to him; &s;he intreated him to take Care of him&s;elf, and not retard his Cure by any Impatience, or Anxiety; &s;he &s;aid a thou|&s;and obliging Things to him, and although &s;he was a little offended at the Freedom he had u&s;ed in taking her Hand &s;o unexpectedly, yet &s;he would not, in the weak Condition he was in, di&s;cover any Re&s;entment towards him, but &s;ecretly re&s;olved to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all Opportunities of being alone with him, le&s;t a le&s;s pardonable Liberty &s;hould e&s;cape him: And fearing he would endanger his Health, by &s;peaking too much, if &s;he protracted her Vi&s;it any longer, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e from her Chair, and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin,</HI> and her Lover, approaching, &s;he took Leave of him, promi&s;ing to &s;ee him &s;oon again. She kept her Word, and vi&s;ited him frequently, but took Care to be as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible left alone at his Bed&s;ide; her Pre&s;ence advanced his Cure more than all the Surgeons Endeavours, he felt no Pain when he &s;aw her, and even the Torments of his Mind were &s;u&s;pended while &s;he was with him; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound &s;o much Sweetne&s;s in that &s;oft and obliging Solicitude &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for his Re|covery, that he began to dread le&s;t his Wound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be cured too &s;oon.</P>
<P><Q>Would to Heaven, Madam, &s;aid he to her, one Day, when &s;he a&s;ked him how he was, that I might continue &s;till for Years in this Condition, the highe&s;t Health has
<PB N="130" REF="131">
not half &s;o many Charms for me as the&s;e Wounds, &s;ince they procure me the Ble&s;&s;ing of &s;eeing you, and of being a&s;&s;ured that you take &s;ome Intere&s;t in my Health.</Q></P>
<P>Although he &s;poke the&s;e Words very low, &s;o that they could only be heard by the Coun|te&s;s, the re&s;t of the Company, who came with her to vi&s;it, &s;tanding at &s;ome Di&s;tance in Di&s;cour&s;e, yet &s;he blu&s;hed, and was in great Confu&s;ion.
<Q>You make an ill U&s;e of my Conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;aid &s;he &s;oftly in An&s;wer, and you will force me to forbear my Vi&s;its, unle&s;s you treat me with more Re&s;pect.</Q>
The&s;e Words were &s;evere enough to have given the Chevalier great Pain, for nothing is &s;o timid as a true Lover; but a Smile, which immediately after beamed over the fair Face of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> and a parting Look &s;he gave him, which expre&s;&s;ed more Compa&s;|&s;ion than Anger, calmed his Fears, and not|with&s;tanding his Wi&s;hes to the contrary, his Cure was &s;oon perfected, and he obliged, through Decency, to quit the Count of <HI>Berci's</HI> Hou&s;e, and remove to his own.</P>
<P>He now thought him&s;elf in a frightful So|litude, Ab&s;ence increa&s;ed his De&s;pair, with|out dimini&s;hing his Love; he had been &s;o u&s;ed to the Sight of the charming Counte&s;s, every Day, that he could not live without it. When the Hour approached, in which &s;he and her Friends u&s;ed to vi&s;it him, he felt more &s;en&s;ibly, the Want of that charming
<PB N="131" REF="132">
Pre&s;ence, which while enjoyed, annihilated his Torments. He &s;ought for Relief in Com|pany and Amu&s;ements, but in Crouds he was alone, and in the mid&s;t of Plea&s;ures ab&s;orb|ed in Melancholy.&mdash; Love pur&s;ued him every where, but a Love without Hope; and Rea|&s;on, which he &s;ometimes called to his Aid, when it repre&s;ented to him that his Pur&s;uit was fruitle&s;s, increa&s;ed his De&s;pair, but left his Pa&s;&s;ion more violent than before.</P>
<P>Nor was the Counte&s;s without her Inquie|tudes: Her Tenderne&s;s for the Chevalier, though innocent, was a perpetual Reproach to her in her own Mind; Rea&s;on and Du|ty dictated to her, that &s;he ought to combat &s;uch Thoughts, as &s;eemed to incroach upon the Love &s;he owed her Hu&s;band; while, on the other hand, the Services &s;he had re|ceived from the Chevalier demanded her Gratitude. His unhappy Love excited her Compa&s;&s;ion, and his Merit forced her E&s;teem; fain would &s;he have per&s;uaded her&s;elf, that the Sentiments &s;he had for him were au|thori&s;ed by the Obligations he had conferred on her whole Family: but her Heart was pure, and the Voice of Rea&s;on, though not heard amid&s;t the Tumult of unre&s;trained and lawle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ions, yet is readily li&s;tened to by doubting Virtue. Hence it followed, that the Counte&s;s e&s;caped all tho&s;e Snares which the deluding Sophi&s;try of Love laid for her. And although &s;he could not vanqui&s;h her Ten|derne&s;s for the Chevalier, yet looking upon
<PB N="132" REF="133">
it as a Crime, &s;he lived in continual War with her&s;elf, and kept her Will in Subjec|tion, if &s;he could not her Thoughts. The Conver&s;ation of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmar|tin,</HI> as it was tender and &s;en&s;ible, and her Heart &s;incere, was all the Comfort Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> had; but this Lady was likewi&s;e far from being happy.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> &s;till continued their Ad|dre&s;&s;es to her; their Jealou&s;y, notwith&s;tand|ing their Endeavours to conceal it, as well from her as from each other, broke out in all their Looks and Actions. She dreaded the Effects of it; &s;he loved the Marquis, and &s;he felt nothing but Indifference for Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> neverthele&s;s &s;he was obliged to conceal her real Sentiments, and treat them with equal Re&s;erve.</P>
<P>It is extremely difficult to act always in Oppo&s;ition to our Inclinations: and to a Mind naturally &s;incere and artle&s;s, all Di&s;&s;imulation is painful. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> &s;uf|fered great Unea&s;ine&s;s from the continual Re&s;traint &s;he laid upon her&s;elf, but &s;he trem|bled, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be the Cau&s;e of a &s;econd Rupture between the&s;e friendly Rivals. They haunted her perpetually, they vi&s;ited her to|gether, they followed her to all public Places; and if, to get rid of the Importunity of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> &s;he &s;ometimes refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, it was nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e, that &s;he
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;hould deprive her&s;elf of the Plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing her beloved Marquis, who&s;e De&s;tiny, by the peculiar Unhappine&s;s of her Situation, was not more fortunate than that of his Rival. It is true, &s;he might have freed her&s;elf from &s;o cruel a Tyranny, by declaring at once her Choice; but terrified at what had lately hap|pened, &s;he trembled le&s;t the Rivals &s;hould again di&s;pute the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, with their Swords, and the Lo&s;s of her beloved Marquis would then be unavoidable; for if he did not peri&s;h by his Rival's Hand, he could not a &s;econd time hope for a Pardon: She re&s;olved, therefore, to &s;ee neither of them, till Time had produced &s;ome Alteration in their Minds; and Ab&s;ence from the Marquis &s;eem|ed le&s;s painful to endure, than the cruel Alter|native of treating both with equal Indifference, where one was &s;o greatly preferred.</P>
<P>Having taken her Re&s;olution, &s;he told them, when they came as u&s;ual to vi&s;it her, that, for very important Rea&s;ons, which &s;he could not, at that Time, explain to them, &s;he mu&s;t de&s;ire they would forbear their Vi&s;its.</P>
<P>The Lovers, thunder-&s;truck at &s;o &s;evere a Decree, gazed on her &s;ome Moments in Si|lence. The Marquis, at length, recovering from his fir&s;t Con&s;ternation, began to expo&s;|tulate with her upon the Cruelty of her Pro|ceeding. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> was greatly affected, &s;carce could &s;he re&s;train her
<PB N="134" REF="135">
Tears, and &s;ome Sighs in &s;pite of her made their Way as &s;he &s;poke to her Lover, to whom &s;he confirmed, tho' with a faltering Voice, his Sentence. Her Emotion did not e&s;cape his Ob&s;ervation, it gave Ri&s;e to vari|ous Reflexions in his Mind, he turned from her and went to a Window, where he &s;tood ruminating upon what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean Time Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> who had been &s;o &s;hocked with her cruel Pro|hibition, that he had not been able to attend to what &s;he &s;aid to his Rival, began to urge her with the mo&s;t vehement Intreaties to change her Re&s;olution. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin</HI> found no Reluctance in her&s;elf to deny him, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him with great Steadine&s;s, that &s;he had taken it upon mature Delibera|tion, and that nothing he could &s;ay, would have Power to alter it. The Marquis ap|proaching her as &s;he pronounced the&s;e Words, told her that he would give her a convincing Proof of his Pa&s;&s;ion, by paying an implicit Obedience to her Commands. He bowed low as he fini&s;hed the&s;e Words, which Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> looking upon as the Signal for going away, only conjured her not to make the Time of their Bani&s;hment too long, &s;ince it would be difficult for them to obey her and live, and then taking a re&s;pectful Leave, he followed the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and they both went out of the Hou&s;e together.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> &s;aw them, and perceiving an unu&s;ual Di&s;compo&s;ure on their Countenances, a&s;ked them the Rea&s;on of it. They acquainted him with what had happen|ed, and intreated him to advi&s;e them how to act in &s;uch a perplexing Situation.</P>
<P>The Chevalier very frankly told them, it was their Part to obey: he repre&s;ented to them, that the Extremities to which their Jealou&s;y had formerly carried them, was without Doubt the Cau&s;e which had induced Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> to bani&s;h them from her Pre&s;ence; and that it was that very Jealou&s;y, the Effects of which &s;he dreaded now, which had made them commit a Fault, that to repeat, would render them wholly in|excu&s;able; and at the &s;ame Time that it de|prived them of the E&s;teem of their Mi&s;tre&s;s, would infallibly draw upon them the Anger of their Prince, who would not be again prevailed upon to pardon them. He added, that if they truly loved Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin,</HI> they would leave her to the Freedom of making her Choice, and not expo&s;e her to the Hatred of the Public, by making her the Subject of new Quarrels and more Blood|&s;hed: and la&s;tly he conjured them to remem|ber their old Friend&s;hip, which they had &s;o lately renewed with mutual Oaths, and not to re&s;ign them&s;elves to the wild Rage of Jea|lou&s;y, which had already produced &s;uch dread|ful Effects.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">They both a&s;&s;ured him, that although they could not renounce their Love for Mademoi|&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> yet they would obey her Orders whatever it co&s;t them. The Cheva|lier then obliging them to promi&s;e that neither of them would take any Mea&s;ures to produce an Alteration in the Mind of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> without acquainting each other, they parted with a full Re&s;olution to keep their Word.</P>
<P>Accordingly for &s;ome Days, they religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved the Promi&s;e by which they had bound them&s;elves. They were equally afraid of of|fending their Mi&s;tre&s;s, and of giving each other any Occa&s;ion of Di&s;gu&s;t. They flat|tered them&s;elves that in the variety of Amu&s;e|ments which are to be found in <HI>Paris,</HI> they &s;hould meet with &s;ome Aleviation of their Grief. But the Di&s;&s;ipation in which they lived, could not bani&s;h the Idea of Mademoi|&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> from their Thoughts; all Objects became di&s;agreeable, but that which they were forbidden to behold, and which was neverthele&s;s always pre&s;ent to their Imaginations.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> le&s;s politic or more impatient than the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> was the fir&s;t who re&s;olved to get rid of this tormenting Re&s;traint. He hired an Apart|ment oppo&s;ite to the Hou&s;e where Mademoi|&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> lived, believing it would be &s;ome Relief to him, to be in a Place where
<PB N="137" REF="138">
he might &s;ometimes behold her at a Window, or &s;ee her get in and out of her Coach. He did not reflect upon the Con&s;equences of this ra&s;h Step, and fal&s;ely imagined that there was nothing in it contrary to the Obedience he had vowed to pay to the Orders of his Mi&s;|tre&s;s, nor to the Promi&s;e he had made to his Rival.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who had placed Spies upon Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> which gave him an exact Information of his Con|duct, &s;oon learned by one of them, that his Rival was never to be found in his own Hou&s;e, nor &s;een in any Place of public Diver&s;ion, but &s;pent all his Hours in an Apartment oppo&s;ite to the Hou&s;e of the Lady they both loved, which he had hired for the Conveniency of &s;eeing her. The Marquis ea&s;ily &s;aw that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> had no Intention to for|get her, and thinking him&s;elf di&s;pen&s;ed with, from keeping his Word with a Man who had fir&s;t broke through his Engagements, he re|&s;olved to derive &s;ome Advantages from this Breach of Faith in his Rival, and endeavour to prevail upon Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> to repeal his Bani&s;hment. Being informed the next Day, that Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin</HI> was gone to the Thuilleries with ano|ther Lady, he ordered his Coach in an In|&s;tant and drove thither, determined to com|plain to her of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI>'s ungene|rous Behaviour, and intreat her to do him Ju&s;tice. He found it was the Counte&s;s of
<PB N="138" REF="139">
<HI>Berci</HI> his Si&s;ter who was with her: which gave him more Courage to approach her, after having paid his Compliments to her with great Re&s;pect, he intreated her not to con|demn him till &s;he had heard him. He told her it was true that by coming into her Pre|&s;ence, contrary to her expre&s;s Prohibition, he appeared a Rebel to her Orders, but he had &s;uch Rea&s;ons to urge in his Excu&s;e, as would, he hoped, ju&s;tify him in her Opinion. He then informed her of what Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> had done, he repre&s;ented to her, that it was not ju&s;t his Rival &s;hould every Hour enjoy the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, while he langui&s;hed in a cruel Bani&s;hment. He hinted, that if &s;he did not admit the Ju&s;tice of his Plea, he &s;hould have Room to &s;u&s;pect that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> was more favoured than him&s;elf; and perceiving that this In&s;inua|tion gave her &s;ome Emotion, he pur&s;ued it with &s;uch Art, and painted the Torments he endured, during the Ab&s;ence &s;he had con|demned him to, in Colours &s;o lively, that Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> was moved, &s;he looked upon Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI>'s Behavi|our as an In&s;tance of Di&s;re&s;pect to her, and as a Breach of Honour to his Friend. She thought her&s;elf affronted by his taking an Apartment &s;o near her, and as one is ea&s;ily per&s;uaded of the Guilt of tho&s;e whom one di&s;|likes, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI>'s Conduct, how|ever innocent in it&s;elf, to her prejudiced Mind appeared a Crime worthy of her ut|mo&s;t Rigor. Nothing could have happened
<PB N="139" REF="140">
more agreable to her Inclinations, &s;he loved the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and wanted a &s;pecious Pretence for recalling him. She had now found &s;uch an Occa&s;ion as &s;he had wi&s;h|ed for, the ab&s;ent Lover was treated as a pre&s;umptuous Man who had di&s;obeyed her Or|ders, and was therefore condemned to per|petual Bani&s;hment, while the happy Marquis was li&s;tened to favourably, his Complaints acknowledged to be ju&s;t, and the Means he pur&s;ued to procure Satisfaction lawful. It is not difficult to find Favour with a partial Judge. The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> &s;oon gained his Cau&s;e before this Tribunal, at the Expence of the unfortunate <HI>de Morigny.</HI></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> joined in her Bro|ther's Reque&s;t, that he might be permitted to &s;ee her. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> at la&s;t con&s;ented to receive his Vi&s;its, but with great Caution; &s;he flattered her&s;elf that their Meet|ings might be carried on &s;o privately, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he was &s;o near a Neighbour, might not be in|formed of them. It was agreed that the Marquis &s;hould never come to her Hou&s;e till it was Night, &s;he was a&s;&s;ured that his Pa&s;&s;ion was honourable, and having the Sanction of his Si&s;ter's Concurrence to the&s;e private In|terviews, they thought there was nothing to apprehend on the Score of Scandal.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> u&s;ed to re|tire early to her Apartment, and when her
<PB N="140" REF="141">
Servants were in Bed, her Woman, who was well paid by the Marquis for her Secre&s;y, al|ways introduced him into the Hou&s;e, where he generally &s;taid an Hour or two with his Mi&s;tre&s;s. For &s;ome Time the&s;e happy Lovers continued undi&s;turbed in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Liberty, they had &s;o long wi&s;hed for, of &s;eeing and declaring to each other their mutual Tenderne&s;s. But it is a difficult thing to deceive a jealous Man long: he is the Argos of the Fable, his hundred Eyes are continually open, and no Charms are able to clo&s;e one of them for a Moment.</P>
<P>It happened that the Marquis, coming one Morning at three o'Clock out of the Hou&s;e of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> that young Lady, that &s;he might have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him a Moment longer, looked out of the Window after her Lover, who was then in the Street. The Moon &s;hone bright, and the unhappy <HI>de Morigny,</HI> who was too much in Love to &s;leep &s;oundly, hearing &s;ome little Noi&s;e in the Street, ran to his Window, and &s;oftly opening it, he had the Mortification to &s;ee his Rival taking Leave of his Mi&s;tre&s;s with Expre&s;&s;ions which &s;hewed he was in a Situa|tion very different from his, and to hear Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> an&s;wer him with great Tenderne&s;s. But as if this was not enough to torment the unfortunate <HI>Morigny,</HI> and that nothing &s;hould be wanting to com|pleat his De&s;pair, the Marquis took it into his Head to intreat Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin,</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="142">
to throw him &s;ome Trifle out of the Window, that he might have the Plea&s;ure to have &s;omething in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that Night which belonged to her.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> refu&s;ed to grant this Reque&s;t at fir&s;t, and turned it into Ridicule, but the Marquis pre&s;t her &s;o ear|ne&s;tly, that at la&s;t &s;he to&s;&s;ed him a white Handkerchief &s;he had in her Hand; however it was le&s;s in compliance with what &s;he thought a &s;illy Reque&s;t, than her De&s;ire to get him away, lea&s;t by &s;taying longer in the Street, &s;ome unlucky Chance might di&s;cover him to his Rival. The Marquis catched the Handkerchief &s;he threw him, and ki&s;&s;ing it, made a profound Bow to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, wi&s;h|ing her as happy as he &s;hould be that Night with &s;uch a Favour in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and then departed.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> heard and &s;aw all that pa&s;t. Rage and De&s;pair had almo&s;t deprived him of his Sen&s;es, he was &s;everal Times upon the Point to ru&s;h out upon his happy Rival, and &s;acrifice him to his ju&s;t Revenge, before the Eyes of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and by one la&s;t Combat decide the Fate of his Life and Love. But he was withheld, almo&s;t in Spite of him&s;elf, by his eager De&s;ire to &s;ee and hear all; but when he &s;aw the Marquis go away, he cur&s;ed his Imprudence and his Folly, for &s;uffering him to e&s;cape without taking a &s;evere Revenge upon him, for the Injury he
<PB N="142" REF="143">
had done him. He then comforted him&s;elf with the Thought of demanding Satisfaction of his fal&s;e Friend the next Day, and threw him&s;elf upon his Bed, full of the hoped for Vengeance. But when this fir&s;t Fury gave way to calmer Reflexions, he found that he was mi&s;erable, that he had nothing to hope for from Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> and that the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> was be|loved. Grief now took the Place of Fury, and a Thir&s;t of Vengeance. He could not think of lo&s;ing Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> for ever, without Agonies not to be de&s;cribed: he gave way a while to the&s;e fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of De&s;pair, and Death &s;eemed to be his only Re&s;ource. But the Mind, amid&s;t the mo&s;t violent Pangs of Sorrow, naturally turns it|&s;elf towards any po&s;&s;ibility of Relief: he began to reflect upon the extreme Indiffe|rence Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> had al|ways &s;hewn him, he blamed him&s;elf for en|tertaining Hopes unju&s;tly founded, and con|cluded that if he had not blinded him&s;elf by tho&s;e intoxicating Expectations, his Pa&s;&s;ion would not have gained &s;uch Strength. He con&s;idered whether an Attempt to &s;ubdue it, might not &s;till be &s;ucce&s;sful, and if the De|&s;pair to which he was reduced, might not, by a proper Exertion of his Rea&s;on, be pro|ductive of his Cure. The fir&s;t Fruit of the&s;e Thoughts was a &s;alutary Shame for his own Weakne&s;s, he blu&s;hed for having given way to Tran&s;ports unworthy of a Man of Sen&s;e and Courage. The Marquis's Behaviour

<P>A Change &s;o &s;udden, although not frequent, is neverthele&s;s not impo&s;&s;ible, and would be oftener effected, if the &s;till Voice of Rea&s;on be li&s;tened to: the ba&s;e Subjection we live in to our own De&s;ires, is the Effect of our Pu&s;illanimity. We need only to fight to be acquainted with our Strength; if Love &s;o often engages us with Succe&s;s, it is becau&s;e we find him Arms again&s;t our&s;elves, and he is &s;trong only in our Weakne&s;s.

<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> was convinced of this Truth, he took Care not to expo&s;e him&s;elf again to the Danger of &s;eeing Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> he knew his own Weakne&s;s and her Power. He was per&s;uaded that all
<PB N="145" REF="146">
the wi&s;e Re&s;olutions he had taken would vani&s;h in her Pre&s;ence. He therefore returned to his own Hou&s;e, and avoided Company and public Places as much as po&s;&s;ible, that he might have no Opportunity of &s;eeing or bearing of that fatal Beauty, whom it was now his Bu&s;ine&s;s to forget. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> had always a pious Turn: Di&s;appointments in worldly Affairs have often contributed greatly to|wards making a devout Chri&s;tian; he applied him&s;elf to religious Books for Con&s;olation in his Misfortunes. In this Study he found not only what he &s;ought, Re&s;ignation and Peace, but they al&s;o in&s;pired him with a Zeal &s;uitable to his Years and Condition, an active Zeal which laid the Foundation of a De&s;ign, to which the brighte&s;t Actions of his Life were owing. He re&s;olved to con&s;ecrate his future Days to the Service of Religion, by fighting again&s;t its mo&s;t redoutable Enemy, who by his own Strength and the va&s;t Extent of Do|minion which he had u&s;urped, was &s;till le&s;s dreadful to Chri&s;tendom, than by the Di&s;|union and different Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tian Princes.

<P><PB N="146" REF="147">Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> felt a generous Com|pa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e unhappy Sufferers, he was de&s;irous of a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf with tho&s;e brave and pious Knights, who bound them&s;elves by &s;olemn Vows to con&s;ecrate their Labours to the Service of Religion, and who &s;wore upon the Altar an eternal Hatred to the Infidels, and to maintain a continual War again&s;t them. The Order of the Religious of <HI>Saint John</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was then a Nur&s;ery fruit|ful in great Men, and valiant Warriors. An End &s;o noble, and a Vocation &s;o eminent, were conformable to the martial Inclinations of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> his Zeal increa&s;ed every Day, and he re&s;olved not to defer any longer his Entrance into that Order, which was both a military and religious one.

<P>When all was fini&s;hed, he &s;ent Invitations to his Friends, to require they would meet at his Hou&s;e: he then, in few Words, acquain|ted them with his De&s;ign, which he was ready to put into Execution immediately, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf particularly to the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI></P>

<P>Mean Time the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> being perfectly recovered of his Wounds, made fre|quent Vi&s;its to the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> &s;till fancy|ing that the Sight of his lovely Mi&s;tre&s;s would alleviate his Pains, while in reality that Sight only &s;trengthened his Di&s;ea&s;e: when Chance afforded him an Opportunity of &s;peaking to her in private, the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion would &s;ometimes force him to make Com|plaints of her Rigor, and his own Unhappi|ne&s;s; but the&s;e Complaints always drew up|on him &s;evere Reproaches from the Counte&s;s, who&s;e only Con&s;olation it was, amid&s;t the Unea&s;ine&s;s in which &s;he was plunged, that &s;he religiou&s;ly adhered to the Duty &s;he owed her Lord.</P>

<P>The Chevalier could not help acknowledg|ing the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of her Arguments, and

the&s;e Conver&s;ations always ended by Repen|tance on his Side, and new A&s;&s;urances of never offending her with &s;uch pre&s;umptuous Complaints for the future.</P>
<P>But he did not long enjoy the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and declaring to her the Exce&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion: new Misfortunes tore him &s;oon after from the Pre&s;ence of her who was &s;o dear to him, and then it was that a fatal Experience &s;hewed him that a hopele&s;s Ab&s;ence was a Torment greater than any he had yet felt.</P>
<P>In effect whatever Precautions his Friends u&s;ed to prevent his entertaining any Su&s;pici|ons of the Per&s;on who had attempted to get him a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, he was at length brought to his Knowledge, and at a Time when he had lo&s;t all Remembrance of the Injury as well as the De&s;ire of Revenge.</P>
<P>One of tho&s;e bu&s;y Sycophants, who &s;warm in Courts, meeting the Chevalier one Day, told him with great Appearance of Friend|&s;hip, and Regard for his Honour, that the Public were a&s;toni&s;hed at the Patience with which he bore the Injury offered him by the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> for &s;o I &s;hall call the King's Favorite, who was indeed the real Author of that dete&s;table Attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> He added, that although he was convinced it was owing to his Gene|ro&s;ity and Greatne&s;s of Soul, that he did not
<PB N="151" REF="152">
take a Revenge &s;uitable to the Wrong that had been done him, yet that the Court judged otherwi&s;e, and attributed the extreme Indif|ference he &s;hewed in an Affair which &s;o near|ly concerned his Honour, to his Fear of of|fending the King, who&s;e Fondne&s;s for the Count was well known: but that no Con&s;i|deration whatever ought to oblige him to pa&s;s over quietly &s;uch a glaring Injury, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould take &s;ome Re&s;olution immediately to &s;ilence Reports &s;o injurious to his Reputation.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who at fir&s;t could not comprehend what the Man meant by talking to him of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> and the Revenge it was expected he &s;hould take of him, made him repeat what he had &s;aid. The bu&s;y Courtier then gave him a long Account of all what had pa&s;&s;ed: He exaggerated many Circum&s;tances, and added many more; and finally a&s;&s;ured him, that it was the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> who had em|ployed A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to murder him, in Revenge for having defeated him in the Tourna|ment.</P>
<P>The Chevalier had Wi&s;dom and Di&s;cre|tion, he was not willing to be precipitated into an Affair of &s;uch Con&s;equence, and was re&s;olved, before he proceeded any far|ther, to examine into it more carefully. He went immediately to the Hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> and, taking him a&s;ide, reproached
<PB N="152" REF="153">
him for his Secre&s;y and Re&s;erve, which had had Con&s;equences that could not but be prejudicial to his Character; he then recount|ed to him all that he had ju&s;t heard, and conjured him earne&s;tly to tell him all he knew, without Di&s;gui&s;e, or Palliation.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> was thrown into great Perplexity by this Demand, he endeavoured to remove his Su&s;picions of the Count of <HI>Po|lan,</HI> but he could not deny that the Public had the &s;ame. The Chevalier, per&s;uaded that they were but too well founded, both by the Flight of the Count of <HI>Polan's</HI> Kin&s;man, with whom he never had any Quarrel, and like|wi&s;e by the Favourite's cool Behaviour to|wards him, which argued a &s;ecret Di&s;gu&s;t, re&s;olved to be revenged; but in the mean Time he carefully concealed his Intentions, and &s;eeming to be quite convinced that the Informations he had received, were fal&s;e, the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> thought the Affair entirely over, and did not apprehend any fatal Con&s;e|quence from his Re&s;entment. But he was mi&s;taken; the Chevalier, under the Appear|ance of great Compo&s;ure, breathed nothing but Fury and Revenge. Neverthele&s;s, the Re&s;olution he had taken to challenge the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> occa&s;ioned &s;ome di&s;agree|able Reflexions. Whatever Way it was ter|minated, he was &s;ure to lo&s;e the Sight of his beloved Counte&s;s, and draw upon him&s;elf the Anger of his King, who would con&s;ider him as doubly criminal, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Law

again&s;t Duelling, for which he had once been pardoned, and by outraging him in the Per|&s;on of a Man whom he greatly e&s;teemed; but the Chevalier, eager for Revenge, could nei|ther be influenced by the Voice of Love or Ambition.

oppo&s;ed this Scheme, and advi&s;ed him to go immediately to an E&s;tate which he had in the Heart of <HI>Anjou,</HI> where it was not probable he would be &s;earched for, he a&s;&s;ured him he might remain there in Security, till the King, informed of the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e, and the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of his Re&s;entment, might be prevailed on to grant him a Pardon. The Chevalier approving of this Expedient, the Count wrote a Letter to the Steward of his Ca&s;tle, in which he commanded him to ac|commodate the Chevalier in the be&s;t manner he could, and charged him, upon Pain of lo&s;ing his Place, not to di&s;cover to any one that he was concealed there.</P>
<P>The Chevalier embraced his dear Count with the utmo&s;t Tenderne&s;s, and thanked him for his friendly Solicitude for his Safety; he left in his Hands a Copy of his Letter to the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> with that unhappy No|bleman's An&s;wer to it, that they might, if nece&s;&s;ary, be &s;hewn to the King.

The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> always made one in their Parties, the Tenderne&s;s which the Counte&s;s his Wife felt for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> having nothing criminal in it, it did not le&s;&s;en the Affection &s;he had for the Count; the Pre&s;ence of a Hu&s;band de&s;erved|ly beloved, always gave her Delight, becau&s;e &s;he had no Cau&s;e to blu&s;h for her own Con|duct with re&s;pect to him: but this Calm in the Counte&s;s's Fortunes did not la&s;t long, &s;he was de&s;tined to prove &s;till greater Mi&s;e|ries than that of hopele&s;s Love.</P>
<P>Her Unhappine&s;s was fir&s;t begun by the irregular Conduct of <HI>Marianne,</HI> her favourite Woman, who &s;hared all the Secrets of her Heart, and who, as has been related before, introduced the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> into her Apartment at <HI>Beauplan.</HI> This Girl was far from imitating the virtuous Examples &s;et her by her Lady: &s;he conceived a violent Pa&s;&s;ion for a young Gentleman, named <HI>Verague,</HI> who was intimately acquainted with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> the Count's Brother. The Counte&s;s, although not naturally &s;u&s;picious, yet &s;oon di&s;covered this mi&s;placed Love, which could not but be productive of Di&s;honour to her Woman, if not timely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: but &s;he
<PB N="160" REF="161">
&s;aw with Pain, that <HI>Marianne</HI> was &s;o far from endeavouring to conquer her Inclina|tions in Favour of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Verague,</HI> that &s;he gave full Scope to them, and was not even at the Pains to conceal them from her.</P>
<P>The Advances this indi&s;crete Girl made to <HI>Verague,</HI> &s;oon attracted his Notice. She was young and hand&s;ome: he pur&s;ued his Con|que&s;t, and a regular Intrigue commenced be|tween them; the Counte&s;s often &s;urpri&s;ed them together at very undue Hours. She expo&s;tulated with her Woman upon the Danger to which &s;he expo&s;ed her Virtue, by permitting the Addre&s;&s;es of one too much her &s;uperior, to give her Hopes of being his Wife. <HI>Marianne</HI> was &s;o far from profiting by the prudent Remon&s;trances of her Lady, that her Pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to gather Strength from the Ob&s;tacles which oppo&s;ed it. She was no longer &s;olicitous to conceal her Commerce with <HI>Verague,</HI> from her Lady; &s;he threw a&s;ide all Caution, and admitted him into her Cham|ber, at all Hours, without the lea&s;t Re|&s;erve.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was in great Affliction at this &s;candalous Behaviour: &s;he contented her|&s;elf at fir&s;t with reproving her for it in her u&s;ual gentle manner, but &s;he did not dare to exert the Authority of a Mi&s;tre&s;s, that has nothing to apprehend from a Servant's Re|&s;entment; &s;he had unfortunately confided to
<PB N="161" REF="162">
this Girl her Affection for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and however irreproachable her Con|duct with re&s;pect to him might be, yet &s;he was apprehen&s;ive that if &s;he drove her to Ex|tremity, &s;he might prejudice her Brother-in-law again&s;t her, who&s;e Su&s;picions would &s;oon infect her Lord likewi&s;e. The Counte&s;s's Ca&s;e was not ab&s;olutely &s;ingular, and it ought to warn the gentle Sex to be cautious how they make Confidents of their Dome&s;tics; and to make tho&s;e who are unhappy enough to have Intrigues, tremble at the Danger to which they expo&s;e them&s;elves by accepting of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Marianne,</HI> in&s;olent upon her being the De|po&s;itory of her Lady's Secret, and fancying her&s;elf in full Security, &s;oon threw off the Ma&s;que entirely. Re&s;erve and Con&s;traint &s;uited not with that Ta&s;te of Libertini&s;m which &s;he had imbibed, and &s;he carried her Immode&s;ty to &s;uch Exce&s;s, that <HI>Ve|rague</HI> was almo&s;t every Night brought in|to her Chamber, when her Lady was re|tired into her Apartment, and they &s;eldom parted till the next Morning. The Coun|te&s;s lo&s;t all Patience at &s;uch infamous Be|haviour, her whole Soul was filled with a ju&s;t Indignation, and left no room for pru|dential Con&s;iderations; &s;he became all on a &s;udden intrepid to the la&s;t Degree, and was re&s;olved, at the Hazard of whatever might happen, to turn the vile <HI>Marianne</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="163">
out of her Family, and gave her but three Days to procure another E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>But this Girl, full of Grief for being di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed on an Occa&s;ion &s;o &s;hameful for her, for &s;he did not doubt but her Lady would di&s;clo&s;e her Rea&s;ons for acting in the man|ner &s;he did, by her; and &s;till more afflicted that &s;he &s;hould be deprived of the Oppor|tunities &s;he had hitherto enjoyed of &s;eeing her Lover, u&s;ed her utmo&s;t Endeavours to prevent her being obliged to leave her Ser|vice; but finding her Lady firmly re&s;olved to di&s;mi&s;s her, &s;he in&s;tantly conceived the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t dete&s;table Project that a wicked Woman could be capable of. This was, to prevent the Effects of the Coun|te&s;s's Indignation, and accu&s;e her of Un|cha&s;tity and Di&s;loyalty to her Lord.</P>
<P>When her Imagination had pre&s;ented her with this diabolical Scheme, &s;he endeavour|ed to &s;trengthen her&s;elf in her Re&s;olution to ruin her Lady, and to &s;tifle all Remor&s;e. And having &s;ettled her Plan, &s;he threw her&s;elf in young <HI>Berci's</HI> Way, and earne&s;t|ly entreated him to give her a few Mo|ments Audience in his own Apartment.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed at her Re|que&s;t, but more at the &s;eeming Emotion with which it was made, de&s;ired her to at|tend him immediately. As &s;oon as they had entered his Chamber, <HI>Marianne</HI> bur&s;t into
<PB N="163" REF="164">
Tears: he eagerly a&s;ked her the Cau&s;e of her Affliction. She fir&s;t an&s;wered only by Sighs, and a feigned Confu&s;ion, which &s;ti|mulated his Curio&s;ity, and made him re|peatedly urge his Reque&s;t. &mdash; At length, with interrupting Sobs, &s;he told him, that her Lady had, with the utmo&s;t Cruelty and Inju&s;tice, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her from her Ser|vice.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI> finding this was all, replied calmly that his Si&s;ter-in-law would not have acted thus without &s;ome Cau&s;e, that if &s;he would confe&s;s her Fault inge|nuou&s;ly, he would engage to make her Peace with her Lady. <HI>Marianne</HI> &s;miled &s;cornfully at that Promi&s;e, and, &s;haking her Head, gave him to under&s;tand that the Thing was impo&s;&s;ible. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> a little alarmed, and anxious to know more, gave her his Word, that if &s;he would di&s;|clo&s;e the Rea&s;ons which had induced her Lady to di&s;mi&s;s her, he would not only keep her Secret faithfully, but u&s;e his ut|mo&s;t Endeavours to &s;erve her.</P>
<P>The perfidious and wicked <HI>Marianne,</HI> having already &s;ettled in her Thoughts what &s;he &s;hould &s;ay, began in this Manner:</P>
<P><Q>I am extremely concerned, Mon&s;ieur, at the Nece&s;&s;ity I am under to unfold a My&s;|tery to you, which will equally &s;urprize and grieve you; but I am &s;till more afflict|ed
<PB N="164" REF="165">
at the Part I have unwillingly acted in it. I conjure you to believe, that if I break the Silence I have &s;o long held, it is only to prove my Penitence and my Submi&s;&s;ion, and in full Reliance upon the Promi&s;e you have given me, that the Secret &s;hall never e&s;cape you. I have been long tortured with the Stings of my own Con&s;cience for the Treachery I have been forced to be guilty of to my Lord, by &s;erving his Lady in a criminal Pa&s;&s;ion, which you are not wholly unacquainted with your&s;elf: but it is Time that I &s;hould re|&s;tore Peace and Tranquility to my Mind, &s;o long di&s;tracted with Remor&s;e, and which my Lady, by her imprudent Rage again&s;t me, has made it nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould di&s;cover to clear, my own Innocence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Know then, Mon&s;ieur, pur&s;ued this Mon&s;ter, that the &s;ame Day which made my Lady acquainted with the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> for her, who&s;e Complaints in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Beauplan</HI> you heard as well as &s;he, gave Ri&s;e to a flame in her heart for him; the Alarm &s;ome Nights afterwards in the Ca&s;tle &s;uppo&s;ed to be oc|ca&s;ioned by an attempt of &s;ome Thieves to ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, was wholly owing to my Lady's Imprudence, in admitting the Chevalier pri|vately into her Apartment: unhappy that I am in the Recollection, it was I who in|troduced him, but I dur&s;t not with&s;tand her peremptory Orders . . . I did all that a Ser|vant
<PB N="165" REF="166">
could do in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I repre&s;ent|ed to her re&s;pectfully the Dangers to which &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf, and &s;he had &s;oon Rea&s;on to be convinced that I had not exaggerated them. The Count your Bro|ther coming unexpectedly into my Lady's Chamber, the Chevalier was obliged to con|ceal him&s;elf behind the Tapi&s;try, and it was wonderful that he was not &s;een for he had &s;carce a Moment to effect his E&s;cape: but a &s;till greater danger followed, for when he left my Lady, &s;he ordered me to conduct him down Stairs without any other Light than that of the Moon, which &s;hone in through the Windows, le&s;t a Taper might alarm &s;ome of the Servants: the Che|valier as he de&s;cended the Stairs made a fal&s;e Step, he fell down and his Pi&s;tol went off, the Report of which put the whole Hou&s;e into Confu&s;ion and Di&s;may. From that Time the Counte&s;s and the Chevalier have carried on a &s;trict Cor|re&s;pondence. You may now, Mon&s;ieur, added &s;he, account for that violent Grief my Lady di&s;covered &s;ome Time ago, when the Sight of her Lover, pale, bloody and in Appearance dead, took from her the Power of di&s;&s;embling. You may now know the Cau&s;e of that Melancholy in which &s;he is continually plunged, &s;ince the Cheva|lier's Duel with the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> which has forced him to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from her, and you know likewi&s;e the Cau&s;e of my Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from her &s;ervice. I am be|come

a trouble&s;ome and importunate In|mate, who&s;e Pre&s;ence &s;he can no longer &s;upport, becau&s;e, taking Advantage of the Chevalier's Ab&s;ence, I endeavour to bring her back to her Duty, and becau&s;e I am tor|tured with Remor&s;e for the Part I have had in her Infidelity to my Lord.</Q></P>
<P>The Wretch ended her Speech with ano|ther Shower of Tears, and with dreadful Inprecations on her&s;elf, if what &s;he had related was not &s;trictly true.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> although he had a high Opinion of his Si&s;ter-in-law's Virtue, yet could not help being &s;taggered at this Re|lation: he knew for a Certainty, that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was in Love with her, his own Ears had heard him declare it in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> and more than once his Eyes, in ob&s;erving tho&s;e of the Cheva|lier and Madame <HI>de Berci,</HI> di&s;covered that his Si&s;ter-in-law was not in&s;en&s;ible; yet he could not imagine her capable of a Crime &s;o hor|rid, as to di&s;honour his Brother in the Man|ner the vile <HI>Marianne</HI> accu&s;ed her of; after giving a few Moments to his reflexions on what he had heard, he took a re&s;olution full of Prudence and Genero&s;ity. As he would not condemn his Si&s;ter-in-law upon the Re|ports of her Servant, &s;o neither could he hold her ab&s;olutely innocent in his own Opinion, &s;ince there were &s;ome Circum&s;tances in her Conduct that bore a doubtful Appearance.
<PB N="167" REF="168">
He thought it ju&s;t to wait till he had more Certainty of her Guilt, before he made her Infamy publick, and &s;uppo&s;ing that if the Lovers were realy guilty, it would not be impo&s;&s;ible for him by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Mari|anne</HI> to &s;urprize them together, as &s;oon as the Chevalier was again permitted to return to <HI>Paris,</HI> he determined to engage this Girl in his Intere&s;t. But if it happened that the Chevalier &s;hould be unable to procure his Pardon, and remain in perpetual Bani&s;hment, he judged it be&s;t to bury all he had heard in Oblivion, &s;ince the honour of his Brother would be pre&s;erved by the Chevalier's Ab|&s;ence, and having then nothing to fear from his Si&s;ter-in-law's indi&s;creet Pa&s;&s;ion, there would be no Nece&s;&s;ity to wound the Peace of the Count, and introduce Di&s;order and In|famy into his Family.</P>
<P>He therefore &s;trictly charged <HI>Marianne</HI> not to impart to any other Per&s;on in the World what &s;he had &s;aid to him: he pro|mi&s;ed to re&s;tore her to her Lady's Favour upon Condition that &s;he would give him a faithful Account of her whole Conduct, par|ticularly in every Thing that related to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars. Marianne</HI> joyfully &s;wore to obey him, and he in&s;tantly went to the Apartment of the Counte&s;s to perform his promi&s;e: he prai&s;ed the affection and fide|lity of that wicked Girl, he exaggerated her Grief for being obliged to quit her Service, and begged the Counte&s;s to take compa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="168" REF="169">
on her, and if her fault was not very great to admit her to her u&s;ual attendance upon her Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was &s;oftened at this Ac|count of her Woman's Contrition. She was not &s;orry that &s;he had a lawful Excu&s;e for taking her again; for &s;he had been under dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of her Malice: &s;he &s;ent for her into her Apartment, and be|fore her Brother, told her, that through his Interpo&s;ition, &s;he had con&s;ented to receive her again but as &s;oon as Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI>; withdrew, &s;he told her, with a very &s;evere Air, that &s;he expected to &s;ee a thorough Reformation in her Conduct, and that it was upon that Condition alone &s;he re&s;tored her to her former Place. The di&s;&s;embling <HI>Marianne,</HI> with tears in her eyes, thanked her Lady for her Goodne&s;s, and promi&s;ed Amendment, but in her Heart &s;he deeply vowed to make her pay dear for the Mortifications &s;he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was &s;carce relieved from the Anxiety this Affair had given her, when &s;he was a&s;&s;aulted by new Di&s;quiets. The Count her Hu&s;band had a Kin&s;man, who having formerly given &s;ome Di&s;gu&s;t to the Court, had been bani&s;hed from <HI>France:</HI> af|ter he had &s;pent &s;ome Years in travelling over all <HI>Europe,</HI> he re&s;olved to &s;ettle in <HI>Venice</HI> for the Remainder of his Life. This City, which is one of the mo&s;t celebrated in all <HI>Italy,</HI> had peculiar Charms for him on Ac|count
<PB N="169" REF="170">
of the Freedom that reigned there. His Quality and Merit &s;oon procured him the Re&s;|pect and E&s;teem of the Nobility of that powerful Republic, who, tho' naturally haughty and not ea&s;y of acce&s;s to Foreigners, yet were &s;olici|tous to make his Re&s;idence among&s;t them plea&s;ing to him. He lived there thirty Years, and dying &s;uddenly in a very advanced Age, the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who was his neare&s;t Relation, &s;ucceeded to all his va&s;t Riches, and as &s;oon as he was informed of his Death, prepared for a Journey to <HI>Venice</HI> to take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>The young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> hav|ing a De&s;ire to vi&s;it <HI>Italy</HI> again, where he had formerly &s;pent &s;ome Months with his Friend Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny,</HI> intreated the Count's Leave to accompany him in this Voyage. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> had not yet taken off her Interdiction, and he was willing to try if a greater Di&s;tance from what he loved, would not weaken his continual Regret, at being deprived of her Pre&s;ence. Be&s;ides he was not without Hope, that an Ab&s;ence which no longer depended upon her Will to revoke, would give his capricious Mi&s;tre&s;s her&s;elf &s;ome little Anxiety.</P>
<P>The Count readily agreed to the Marquis's Propo&s;al, and thanked him for offering &s;o frankly what he would have &s;olicited, had he not thought it too great a Favour. They &s;et out immediately for their Voyage to <HI>Venice,</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="171">
where they arrived happily the Beginning of Spring. They &s;taid there a Month, during which Time the Count &s;ettled all his Affairs; and having a fine Sea&s;on before them, they determined to vi&s;it <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;ome other of the celebrated Cities in <HI>Italy.</HI> In their Return they pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Leghorn,</HI> where they found a Felucca, which was only waiting for a fa|vourable Wind to &s;et Sail for <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> The Count and the Marquis eager to &s;ee again the dear Objects of their Affection, re&s;olved to embark in this Felucca, as being the mo&s;t expeditious Way of returning; be&s;ides the great Heat of the Weather made travelling by Land very di&s;agreeable; but they had no &s;ooner reached the Coa&s;t of <HI>Genoa,</HI> when they had Rea&s;on to repent of their De&s;ign: they were encountered by a Cor&s;air of <HI>Algiers,</HI> whom they found it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape from.</P>
<P>The two <HI>French</HI> Lords, although as brave as Men could be, yet plainly &s;aw that any Re&s;i&s;tance they could make, would not pre|&s;erve their Liberty, but would inevitably ex|po&s;e them to Death, and perhaps to the mo&s;t cruel Tortures; the <HI>Algerine</HI> was manned with a great Number of valiant and de&s;perate <HI>Turks,</HI> who pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the At|tack, while they had very few Sailors and only &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers aboard, who were de|&s;titute of all manner of Defence; with &s;uch Inequality it would have been Madne&s;s to fight: it was re&s;olved therefore that they

&s;hould u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to e&s;cape, and if they proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, to &s;urrender peaceably, that they might not, to no Pur|po&s;e, irritate tho&s;e who were likely to be their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks,</HI> however, having grappled their &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, boarded it with their Cymetars in their Hands; they &s;tript the Pa&s;&s;engers and the Crew to their Shirts, and tying them all to the Oar, &s;et Sail for <HI>Africa.</HI> As they were pur&s;uing their Voyage, full of an in&s;olent and barbarous Joy for the Prize they had taken, their Ve&s;&s;el was driven by a Storm into the Gulf of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> where it was attacked by a <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> Galley, commanded by a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Knight of the Order. The mi&s;erable Captives on board the <HI>Algerine,</HI> beholding this unhoped-for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, offered up the mo&s;t ardent Prayers to Heaven for the Succe&s;s of their Friends. Their Joy and their Hopes were but &s;hort-lived; the Wind, which at fir&s;t was fa|vourable for the <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> Galley, changed &s;ud|denly, as it was attempting to grapple that of <HI>Algiers</HI>; and the Cor&s;air doubting his Strength, endeavoured to e&s;cape by the Force of row|ing, which he effected.</P>
<P>What a dreadful Rever&s;e of Fortune was this for the two <HI>French</HI> Lords, and the re&s;t of the unhappy Captives? But the Surpri&s;e, the Grief, which &s;eized one of tho&s;e brave Knights in the <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> Galley, when he be|held the two noble Slaves, are not to be de|&s;cribed.

The Chevalier <HI>de Morigny,</HI> for it was he him&s;elf, could &s;carce believe the Evi|dence of his own Eyes, when they di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Saint Sauveur,</HI> chained, like a great Num|ber of other Wretches, to the Oar. But the&s;e illu&s;trious Captives, &s;tretching out their Arms loaden with Fetters, and calling him by his Name, convinced him he was not mi&s;taken. They had not Time to conjure him to &s;ave them from the Cruelties of their Enemies: for at that In&s;tant, the Wind &s;econding the Efforts of the Rowers to e&s;cape, the <HI>Algerine</HI> Ve&s;&s;el was at once carried away from his Eyes, and his Vengeance.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Morigny</HI> was incon&s;olable at this &s;ad Sight. Notwith&s;tanding all his Virtue, and his Re&s;ignation to Providence, he &s;uf|fered, with &s;ome Kind of Impatience and Re|pining, the Effects of an Event &s;o favourable to tho&s;e Barbarians, which deprived him of an Opportunity of &s;uccouring two Friends whom he loved with the tendere&s;t Affec|tion. The more he reflected on this &s;trange Adventure, the le&s;s he was able to compre|hend how the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> and his Brother-in-law &s;hould happen to be on Seas &s;o di&s;tant from their native Country, and chained to an Oar in an <HI>Algerine</HI> Ve&s;&s;el. The more he re|flected upon this amazing Accident, the more his Mind was perplexed. The only Thing that now remained for him to do, was to &s;end Notice to <HI>France</HI> of the Captivity of his noble
<PB N="173" REF="174">
Friends: he wrote to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> and gave her an affecting Relation of the &s;ad Spectacle his Eyes had &s;een and wept, her noble Hu&s;band and her Brother mingled with Slaves, and labouring at an Oar; he a&s;&s;ured her, that he would him&s;elf have made a Voyage to <HI>Africa,</HI> to procure their Deliver|ance, but that his Duty obliged him to cruize the Remainder of the Summer upon the Seas: he recommended it to her to &s;end in&s;tantly &s;ome Per&s;on, who&s;e Prudence and Fidelity &s;he could rely upon, to <HI>Africa,</HI> to treat with the Infidels for the Ran&s;om of her Lord and her Brother.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was &s;eized with Horror and Di&s;may at the Contents of this Letter: &s;he fell fainting into the Arms of her Woman, upon reading the fir&s;t Lines, which acquaint|ed her with the mi&s;erable Condition of two Per&s;ons &s;o dear to her; and when &s;he reco|vered, it was only to a painful Sen&s;e of ago|ni&s;ing Sorrow: but her Grief, violent as it was, did not prevent her from contriving in&s;tant Means for their Re&s;cue. Her Lord's Brother was the Per&s;on on whom &s;he ca&s;t her Eyes to manage their Redemption. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI> met her Reque&s;t with a Zeal that &s;hewed the Greatne&s;s of his Af|fection for his Brother; no Dangers could hinder him from undertaking the Voyage to &s;erve him; he pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;peedy Depar|ture, and the Counte&s;s, without waiting for an Application to her Father, gave her Brother-in-law

all the ready Money &s;he had, and her riche&s;t Jewels, to make up the Sum for the Ran&s;om of her Hu&s;band and her Brother.

<P>The Captivity of the&s;e two illu&s;trious <HI>Frenchmen</HI> made a great Noi&s;e at the Court of <HI>France.</HI> A Friend of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> to whom he had confided the Place of his Retreat, &s;ent him this News into <HI>An|jou,</HI> almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was known at Court.

<P>A Lover of equal Delicacy can only feel the Force of this Action, and nothing le&s;s than a Hero can be capable of approving a De&s;ign which &s;o many almo&s;t invincible Ob|&s;tacles &s;eemed to oppo&s;e; but true Love thinks every thing ea&s;y to be done, when the Intere&s;t of the beloved Object is in Que&s;tion.
<PB N="175" REF="176">
The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> li&s;tened to nothing but the Dictates of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and his Cou|rage; already he ta&s;ted the tran&s;porting De|light of doing his Mi&s;tre&s;s a con&s;iderable Ser|vice, and of giving her a new Proof of his Tenderne&s;s. He &s;et out immediately for <HI>Pa|ris</HI> in a Di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;ecurely reached the Hou&s;e of an intimate Friend, where he &s;taid a few Days, to provide him&s;elf with Money nece&s;&s;ary for his Voyage, and the Redemption of the two noble Captives. As &s;oon as every thing was prepared for his Departure, he wrote a Letter to the Counte&s;s, informing her of the Occa&s;ion of his Arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Re&s;olution he had taken to &s;et out imme|diately for <HI>Mar&s;eilles:</HI> he intreated his Friend not to &s;end this Letter to the Counte&s;s, till two Hours after his Departure from <HI>Paris.</HI> He thought it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e this Precau|tion, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould imagine, that he wanted to pay his purpo&s;ed Service by the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, or to draw from her &s;ome Marks of Acknowledgment; and full of the plea&s;ing Hope of &s;oon re&s;toring to her two Per&s;ons who were &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to her, he left <HI>Paris,</HI> and took the Road to <HI>Provence,</HI> at|tended by the &s;ame Gentleman whom he had taken with him to <HI>Anjou.</HI></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> although &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to receive very extraordina|ry Proofs of Love from the Chevalier, yet was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at this la&s;t: &s;he ad|mired the Genero&s;ity and unbounded Courage
<PB N="176" REF="177">
of this faithful Lover, who &s;eemed born to render her new Services. Her Gratitude &s;o &s;trongly engaged her Heart for the fir&s;t time, that it delivered it&s;elf up to a Tenderne&s;s &s;he had hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. A Service of &s;uch Importance to be &s;o eagerly undertaken, without being reque&s;ted, to make a Voyage to a barbarous Region, from whence he might po&s;&s;ibly never return, with a Cou|rage &s;o heroic; &s;uch perfect Di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s, to expect no other Reward than what he found in the Plea&s;ure of &s;erving her; and the great Delicacy he had &s;hewn in renouncing even the Satisfaction of &s;eeing her before his Departure; in a Word, &s;uch &s;triking In&s;tances of the mo&s;t pure and con|&s;tant Pa&s;&s;ion that ever Man was capable of, excited, during &s;ome Moments, Sentiments more &s;oft than Friend&s;hip, and Acknow|ledgments more tender than Gratitude; a while &s;he indulged the &s;weetly painful Emo|tions; but her Duty and her Honour, tho&s;e lawful Tyrants of her Soul, &s;oon united their Forces to deliver her from the A&s;&s;aults of Love.</P>
<P><Q>Oh, Prudence too rigid!

<P>The Counte&s;s was re&s;igning her&s;elf to the&s;e melancholly Reflexions, when Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> came into her Chamber: their Friend&s;hip and Intimacy had long ago ba|ni&s;hed all Re&s;erve; and entering without &s;end|ing Notice of her Arrival, &s;he found Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> bathed in Tears, and &s;o lo&s;t in Grief, that &s;he did not perceive her. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> ran to her afflicted Friend, and with a tender Anxiety begged to know if any new Misfortune had happened to her: the Counte&s;s rai&s;ing her Head and looking on her with Eyes which, tho' &s;wimming in Tears, expre&s;&s;ed a kind Compa&s;&s;ion for her who was but too much concerned in the News &s;he had to tell her. At the Mention of her Lover's Captivity, Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> threw her&s;elf upon a Sopha, with a Sigh that &s;eemed to rend her Heart in Pieces: a deadly Pale|ne&s;s over&s;pread her face, &s;he lifted up her fine Eyes in &s;peechle&s;s Agony to Heaven; a while &s;he abandoned her&s;elf to the Bitterne&s;s of her Reflexions, then turning to the Counte&s;s who was &s;at weeping by her,</P>
<P><Q>Ah! Madam, &s;aid &s;he, it is for me to weep, who by the fooli&s;h extravagance of my Conduct, have lo&s;t, perhaps for ever, the mo&s;t faithful Lover in the World; you have only Fortune to complain of, I have Fortune and My&s;elf: if your Lord groans

in Fetters, you have the Con&s;olation of knowing that you are not the Author of his Mi&s;eries: but it is my Inju&s;tice that has thrown my Lover into a horrid Dungeon, my Cruelty has reduced him to Slavery, but for my Caprice and Folly this dear Brother had now been with you, comforting you under your Misfortunes and endea|vouring to redre&s;s them, without feeling any other him&s;elf but what aro&s;e from his &s;ympathi&s;ing Tenderne&s;s. Alas, my dear Counte&s;s, added &s;he embracing her ten|derly, ought I to hope that you will pardon my Inju&s;tice to your Brother; and then my dear and injured Lover, pur&s;ued &s;he bur&s;ting again into Tears, can&s;t thou forget my injurious Treatment of thee; ah, if Fate ever re&s;tores thee to me, will my Tenderne&s;s and Fidelity repay thee for all the Torments thou ha&s;t &s;uffered through me?</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was greatly moved at the Affliction of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin,</HI> her Heart &s;oftened by her own Woes, made her more &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e of another. The&s;e tender and afflicted Friends pa&s;t all their Time together, the compa&s;&s;ion they mutually afforded each other &s;oothed their Griefs, but the Counte&s;s had &s;ome which &s;he was obliged to &s;mother in her own brea&s;t.

<PB N="179" REF="180">
a lawful Pa&s;&s;ion, and had no Vows to make, but for the Deliverance of her Lover, but the Counte&s;s be&s;ides her Grief for the Captivity of a Hu&s;band and a Brother, whom &s;he loved, trembled for the Life of a Hero who was dear to her, yet whom her Duty forbid her to love.</P>
<P>The Ladies in their calmer Moments often talked of the Genero&s;ity of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and when their Minds were not weakened by dreadful Apprehen&s;ions con|cerning the De&s;tiny of Friends &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to them, they hoped for every Thing favourable from his Zeal, his Courage, and his good Fortune.</P>
<P>Mean Time Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI> arrived at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and embarked immediately in a Ve&s;&s;el that was ready to &s;ail for <HI>Africa,</HI> but they &s;uffered a great deal by Storms, and wandered for more than a Month upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts. The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was more fortunate; he found at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> two Religious of the Order for the Re|demption of Captives, who were waiting only for a favourable Wind to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Oran,</HI> a fortified Town, &s;ituated in the Kingdom of <HI>Algiers</HI> they were to land fir&s;t at this Capital, and afterwards to proceed to <HI>Tunis,</HI> to free a great Number of Slaves, ac|cording to the Engagements of their pious In&s;titution. The Chevalier was rejoiced at an opportunity of joining Per&s;ons, who by
<PB N="180" REF="181">
the frequent Voyages they had made, with a Zeal &s;o holy, into tho&s;e barbarous Countries, were received and treated with Re&s;pect by the Infidels them&s;elves; he flattered him&s;elf that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their charitable Diligence, they would ea&s;ily di&s;cover the Place where his two Friends were confined, and might more &s;ucce&s;sfully treat for their Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>He was not deceived in the&s;e agreeable Expectations, the two Religious promi&s;ed him their utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the Wind be|coming fair, they embarked and &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Africa.</HI> They had a favourable Voyage, and after &s;ome &s;light Storms, that were fol|lowed by no dangerous Accidents, they landed &s;afe at <HI>Oran,</HI> where they propo&s;ed to re&s;t a few Days before, they executed their Com|mi&s;&s;ion, but the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who&s;e Impatience to &s;ee his Friends at Liberty would not &s;uffer him to con&s;ult his own Health, &s;et out in&s;tantly for <HI>Algiers,</HI> tra|velling the Re&s;t of the Way by Land. As he &s;poke the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue perfectly well, he ea&s;ily pa&s;t for a Merchant of that Nation who traded in Jewels. He avoided with great Care every thing that might give the In|fidels the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of his Quality, or the Occa&s;ion of his Voyage. But let us now re|turn to tho&s;e illu&s;trious Victims of their Bar|barity.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">When the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> and the Mar|quis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> &s;aw that the <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> Galley was prevented by the Wind which be|came directly contrary to them, from getting up to the Cor&s;air, and that there was no Pro|bability of their being delivered from their Slavery, they abandoned them&s;elves to the mo&s;t frightful De&s;pair. Their Grief was en|crea&s;ed even by the &s;ight of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mo|rigny,</HI> that Friend &s;o dear to them both, upon who&s;e Valour they depended more than upon that of all the other brave Knights that accompanied him. This cruel event filled them with the mo&s;t melancholy Reflections, all the Horrors of that de&s;tiny which waited for them at <HI>Algiers,</HI> ro&s;e to their Imaginations; their Minds being weakened by the terrible apprehen&s;ions they laboured under, they &s;oon became incapable of performing the la|borious exerci&s;e to which they were de&s;|tined, and this incapacity drew upon them an encrea&s;e of Severity from their cruel Ma&s;ters. At length they re&s;igned them&s;elves with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the decrees of that Providence which orders all human Events, they relied with a pious Confidence upon it, and indulged a hope that the Chevalier <HI>Morigny</HI> would not forget them in their Misfortunes. This la&s;t Thought gave them great Con&s;olation, and flattering them&s;elves that the Cor&s;air would not &s;eparate them in their Pri&s;on, they determined to wait with patience for the happy Moment of their Deliverance.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183">But this Barbarian had no Intention to grant them &s;uch a Favour; the noble Air, and the rich Dre&s;s they were in when he took them, made him conclude that they were Men of high Quality; he determined therefore not to &s;ell them, but to make their Slavery &s;o in&s;upportable by his ha&s;h Treatment, as to make them glad to purcha&s;e their Liberty at any Price he &s;hould demand for it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they landed at <HI>Algiers,</HI> he order|ed them to be thrown into &s;eparate Dungeons, where they had not the lea&s;t Glimmering of Light, he would not allow them to take Leave of each other, they begged only for a parting Embrace, and the Reque&s;t was puni&s;hed with Stripes, which they &s;uffered with &s;uch a noble Patience, and &s;uch Dignity of &s;ilent Grief, as would have moved any other Heart, but that of a Cor&s;air, accu&s;tom|ed to treat Chri&s;tians with the mo&s;t &s;avage Cruelty.</P>
<P>On the fourth Day of their mi&s;erable Con|finement, the Doors of their Dungeons were opened, but it was only to expo&s;e the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> to a Treatment &s;till more humbling and rigorous, than what he had yet endured. As he was of a Con&s;titution more &s;trong and robu&s;t than the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> the inhuman Cor&s;air de&s;tined him to labour in his Lands in the Country; he cau&s;ed him to be conducted thither with five other Slaves, tied two and two together like the vile&s;t Ani|mals.
<PB N="183" REF="184">
He placed a Wretch as cruel as him|&s;elf over them, who gave them no Intermi&s;&s;ion from their Labour, and who puni&s;hed every Symptom of Wearine&s;s with Stripes and abu|&s;ive Language. They were allowed no other Nouri&s;hment than Bread and Water, and at Night when their Labour was ended, they were thrown covered with Sweat and Du&s;t into a dark damp Dungeon where a little Straw was all that compo&s;ed their Bed.</P>
<P>What a dreadful Situation for a Man of the fir&s;t Quality, brought up in Luxury, and &s;urrounded with plea&s;ures. The Marquis <HI>de Saint Sauveur</HI> was treated with le&s;s Barbarity, but he owed his indulgence to the Avarice of the <HI>Cor&s;air</HI>; the great delicacy of his Make made the Wretch apprehen&s;ive that he &s;hould lo&s;e him, if he put him to Labours beyond his Strength. He was therefore em|ployed in his Gardens, but his Grief at being &s;eparated from the Count, joined to his other di&s;quiets, of which Love was the mo&s;t poignant, made his misfortunes not le&s;s un&s;upportable.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> could not long &s;up|port the Weight of &s;o many mi&s;eries, he &s;unk under them at length, and fell dan|gerou&s;ly ill. His Ma&s;ter beginning to fear that he &s;hould lo&s;e him, ordered proper Nouri&s;hment to be given him, and allowed him &s;ome intermi&s;&s;ion from his labour, but as &s;oon as he had recovered Strength,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
he was again obliged to re&s;ume his fir&s;t Employment.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> had been four Days in <HI>Algiers</HI> without being able to do any thing for his Friends; the Pirate had been ab&s;ent three Weeks, but at his Return the Chevalier immediately &s;ent the two Religious to him who had been the Companions of his Voyage; they offered him a very con&s;ide|rable Sum for the Ran&s;om of &s;everal Cap|tives among whom they comprehended the two French Lords; they di&s;covered no par|ticular Solicitude concerning them le&s;t the Terms of their Redemption &s;hould be made more difficult; this Artifice did not &s;ucceed. The <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> made a great Difference between them and his other Slaves, and demanded &s;uch an extravagant Sum for their Freedom, that the two Religious thought proper to &s;peak to him no more on the Subject for &s;ome Days that they might not confirm him in the notion he had conceived of their Qua|lity.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, who&s;e Impatience to &s;ee his Friends at Liberty could not bear any Delay, thought every Moment an Age till he had purcha&s;ed their relea&s;e, and ordered the two <HI>Friars</HI> to give the Pirate whatever he demanded; but they prudently repre&s;ented to him that if they proceeded in that manner with the avaricious <HI>Cor&s;air,</HI> he would in&s;i&s;t upon &s;till harder Conditions, and would ad|vance
<PB N="185" REF="186">
his Price, in Proportion as he &s;aw them eager for their Deliverance. The Chevalier was at length prevailed upon to tru&s;t their Experience and Zeal, with the Conclu&s;ion of a Bargain, which he de&s;ired &s;o ardently. Ac|cordingly the&s;e holy Men went three Days afterwards to the Pirate's Hou&s;e, and without taking any Notice of the two noble Slaves, offered to ran&s;om twelve others, for which they immediately agreed upon the Price. The Pirate &s;eeing them preparing to go without mentioning the Pri&s;oners he had taken in his la&s;t Prize, was the fir&s;t to pro|po&s;e a Sum for their Ran&s;om; the Religious affecting great Indifference, agreed at la&s;t to give ten thou&s;and Livres, which the Cor&s;air accepted, and they promi&s;ed him, to bring the Money the next Morning.</P>
<P>That Moment &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired by the Chevalier, at la&s;t came: the Religious paid the Sum agreed on, and flew to open tho&s;e dreadful Pri&s;ons, the eternal Abode of Horror and of Grief. After telling the unhappy Suf|ferers, with proper Caution, that they were now at Liberty, their Fetters were &s;truck off, and they were led into the open Air. The unexpected News of his Freedom had &s;uch an Effect upon the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who&s;e Mind and Body were greatly weakened, that he fainted away in the Arms of the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who had been fir&s;t taken out of his mi&s;erable Confinement, and had eager|ly advanced to embrace him. The Religious,
<PB N="186" REF="187">
finding all Endeavours to recover the Count from his Swoon ineffectual, they carried him in that Condition to the Lodgings of the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI></P>
<P>That faithful Friend was expecting them with an anxious Impatience: he ran to &s;train them in his Arms, and welcome them to Freedom and Happine&s;s, when &s;eeing the Count brought in motionle&s;s, he &s;topt &s;hort, Grief and Amazement u&s;urped the Place of Joy; he thought he was dead, for a livid Palene&s;s over&s;pread his Face, and he was &s;o emaciated, that he was hardly to be known. He was beginning to give Vent to his Grief and his Complaints for this new Misfortune, when the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who know not of the Chevalier's Arrival at <HI>Algiers,</HI> threw him&s;elf &s;uddenly into his Arms, with Exclamations of Sur|pri&s;e and Joy. For &s;ome Moments, they held each other in a &s;trict Embrace, with|out the Power of expre&s;&s;ing their Senti|ments, any otherwi&s;e than by Tears; their Solicitude for their Friend, at length, drew them out of this Rapture, they both &s;prung in one In&s;tant to him, and by proper Ap|plications he was, at length, brought out of his Swoon, he opened his Eyes, but it was only to turn them wildly about on the Ob|jects around him; in a few Moments his Speech and Under&s;tanding returned, and the Marquis and the Chevalier meeting his Eyes,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
his Surpri&s;e at this View had like to have brought on a Relap&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>All-powerful Heaven! cried he, with a Voice &s;eeble and langui&s;hing, but expre&s;&s;ive of the Emotions his Heart laboured with, what do I &s;ee? Is it a Dream, or am I really awake? &mdash; What Wonders have I beheld this Day! Oh gracious and all wi&s;e Providence! I adore thy infinite Goodne&s;s, in bringing to me again the&s;e Friends &s;o dear to my Soul. &mdash; Fini&s;h, Oh! fini&s;h thy Work, almighty Power, pur&s;ued he with Eyes and Hands rai&s;ed towards Heaven, and re&s;tore me likewi&s;e to the Sight of her, with|out whom I cannot live.</Q></P>
<P>Then holding out his Hand to the Cheva|lier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who &s;tood regarding his Ac|tion with Eyes &s;wimming in Tears of Tender|ne&s;s and Joy,
<Q>Dear and faithful Friend, pur&s;ued he, cea&s;e to load us thus with Be|nefits, or teach us how to acknowledge them, in a manner worthy of thee; but is it po&s;&s;ible to make &s;uitable Returns to this la&s;t Proof of your generous Friend&s;hip? Oh! Brother, added he, turning to the Marquis, our Lives have long &s;ince been his Gift under God, can either of us refu&s;e to &s;acrifice them for his Service?</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier, unable to bear the&s;e Tran&s;ports of his Gratitude, ran into his
<PB N="188" REF="189">
Arms, and embracing him tenderly, congra|tulated him on his Liberty. He then quitted him to the Marquis, who claimed a Share in the Endearments of the beloved Hu&s;band of his Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>When the&s;e mutual Raptures were a little &s;ub&s;ided, they gave each other an Account of what had happened to them during their Se|paration. The Chevalier was greatly affected at the Recital of what his Friends had &s;uffer|ed; the Count in particular, whom the Cor|&s;airs had treated &s;o cruelly that not even the Joy of his recovered Liberty, nor the tender Cares of his Friends could hinder him from feeling the Effects of it. He was &s;eized with a violent Fever, which held him fourteen Days: during the whole Time that his Reco|very was doubtful, the Chevalier and the Marquis were in the utmo&s;t Affliction; but the natural Strength of his Con&s;titution, at length, overcame the Di&s;ea&s;e, and his Health re&s;tored Tranquility and Joy to his &s;ympa|thi&s;ing Friends, who now thought of nothing but ha&s;tening their Departure.</P>
<P>Mean time young <HI>Berci,</HI> who had been to&s;&s;ed about by contrary Winds, and in great Danger from &s;everal Storms, arrived, at length, &s;afe at <HI>Algiers</HI>; the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> were walking upon the Port of that City, whither they were drawn by the Beauty of the
<PB N="189" REF="190">
Place, and the Nece&s;&s;ity they had for &s;ome fre&s;h Air, when the Ve&s;&s;el, that brought Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> entered the Harbour with full Sails: the Chevalier and the Marquis were upon the Point of returning Home, to the Count, who, on account of &s;ome Remainder of Weakne&s;s, could not accom|pany them in their Walk, when their Cu|rio&s;ity to &s;ee the Pa&s;&s;engers, who were pre|paring to land, detained them a few Mo|ments longer: but their Surprize was ex|treme to &s;ee the Count's Brother among them; they ran eagerly to embrace him, nor was he le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed at the Sight of the Marquis and the Chevalier, one of whom he believed in Fetters, and the other in the Heart of <HI>Anjou.</HI> He immediately concluded, that the Chevalier had prevented him in his De&s;ign, nor could he guard his Mind from a little Emotion of Jealou&s;y; he regretted that his Brother and the Marquis &s;hould owe their Deliverance from Slavery to any other than him&s;elf, after the Fatigue and Dangers he had endured to have the Satis|faction of doing them that Service. But the&s;e Thoughts &s;oon gave way to his An|xiety for his Brother; he enquired with a tender Impatience for him; they &s;oon re|lea&s;ed him from his Apprehen&s;ions at not &s;eeing him with them, and carried him im|mediately to their Lodgings.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> was not le&s;s a&s;to|ni&s;hed than they had been, at the Sight of
<PB N="190" REF="191">
his Brother; he embraced him tenderly, and expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Acknowledgment for this Proof of his Affection; with a trembling Eagerne&s;s he enquired after the Health of his Wife, and when Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI> &s;hewed him her Jewels which &s;he had given him to purcha&s;e his Freedom, he bur&s;t into Tears of Joy, Gratitude, and Love. His Impatience to &s;ee again that dear Object of his fonde&s;t Wi&s;hes, gave him new Strength, and he declared that he was able to embark immediately for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>His Friends, however impatient them|&s;elves to return to their native Country, which was &s;till more endeared to them by the Remembrance of tho&s;e beloved Per&s;ons they had left in it, in&s;i&s;ted upon the Count's &s;taying till his Health was perfectly re|e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> had a Mo|tive more &s;trong for his Delay: he could not think of leaving his Servants, that had been taken with him in the Felucca, Vic|tims to the Cruelty of the <HI>Algerines</HI>; he judged of their Sufferings by his own, and his Compa&s;&s;ion for them being heightened by that painful Remembrance, he was re|&s;olved not to leave <HI>Algiers,</HI> till he had ef|fected their Deliverance. It was not with|out great Difficulty that they were found; they had been all &s;old by the Cor&s;airs, and had more than once changed their Ma&s;ters, during the Continuance of their Slavery.
<PB N="191" REF="192">

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Chevalier DES ESSARS AND THE Counte&s;s OF BERCI. PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Count of <HI>Berci</HI> and his noble Friends, as &s;oon as they landed at <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI> offered up a &s;olemn Thank&s;giving to God for the Mercies they had received. They &s;tayed &s;ome Days there, not &s;o much to take a View of all the Beauties of that celebrated City, which, for its Strength, its Extent, and the Security of its Commerce, was in &s;uch high E&s;teem, and drew to it continually Mer|chants from every Nation in the Univer&s;e, but to re&s;t them&s;elves, after the Fatigues of a long Voyage. Their Impatience to &s;ee the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin,</HI>
<PB N="194" REF="195">
prompted the Count and the Marquis to a &s;peedy Departure. The Chevalier, though he was not at Liberty to own his Motive, was no le&s;s eager to get to <HI>Paris</HI>: Accordingly they pur&s;ued their Journey with all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te, and reached that great Ca|pital towards Aut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">.</P>
<P>They alighted all together at the Count of <HI>Berci's</HI> Hotel: he would not &s;uffer the Che|valier to &s;eek any other A&s;ylum than one which he, by his friendly Solicitude, could render mo&s;t &s;ecure to him. He told him, that he would not part with him till the King had &s;igned his Pardon, which he hoped he would not refu&s;e to his Solicitations, and that of his Friends, all of whom would intere&s;t them&s;elves in his Behalf. The Chevalier ex|pre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Gratitude to the Count for his friendly Offers, which too agreably flat|tered his &s;ecret Wi&s;hes, not to be accepted with Joy.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to give an Idea of that Mix|ture of Surpri&s;e, Joy, Tenderne&s;s, and grate|ful Rapture, which filled the Souls of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin</HI> at the Sight of Per&s;ons &s;o dear to them. The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> threw him&s;elf at the Feet of his charming Mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e Eyes welcomed him with &s;treaming Tenderne&s;s, while the Count ran into the Arms of his Wife, and in the mo&s;t endearing Lan|guage expre&s;&s;ed his Joy, at &s;eeing her again.
<PB N="195" REF="196">
It was with Difficulty he tore him&s;elf from her &s;oft Embrace, to pre&s;ent the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to her.</P>
<P><Q>See, Madam, &s;aid he to her, that tender and generous Friend, who makes it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life to &s;erve us; who, not &s;atisfied with having more than once deli|vered us from impending Death, has now freed us from the Horrors of a Slavery far more to be dreaded.</Q>
The Counte&s;s ad|vanced immediately to &s;alute him, plea&s;ed that her Duty and her Inclinations this once co-incided, &s;he gave free Vent to the grate|ful Sentiments that filled her Soul; &s;he prai&s;ed his generous Friend&s;hip, &s;he acknow|ledged the great Obligations &s;he owed him, and a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he &s;hould ever pre&s;erve the mo&s;t grateful Remembrance of them.</P>
<P><Q>I have done nothing, Madam, &s;aid the Chevalier, interrupting the Counte&s;s, than what any other, in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, and with the &s;ame Incitements, would have done; but were the Services I have been &s;o happy to render your Lord and your Bro|ther, far more con&s;iderable, they would be overpaid by the Sen&s;ibility you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s for them; and am I not doubly rewarded, pur&s;ued he &s;miling, and direct|ing the Eyes of the Count and Counte&s;s to the young Marquis, who was pouring out his Soul in grateful Tran&s;ports at the Feet of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, by the Plea&s;ure I feel my|&s;elf,
<PB N="196" REF="197">
at re&s;toring a faithful Lover to the Ob|ject of his Wi&s;hes?</Q></P>
<P>The Marquis and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Mont|martin</HI> finding they were ob&s;erved, joined the re&s;t of the Company, and the Conver|&s;ation became more general: that lovely Girl thought it would be no Violation of the Laws of Mode&s;ty and Decorum, to join her Thanks for the Delivery of the noble Captives, to tho&s;e of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI>; &s;he could no longer di&s;gui&s;e her real Senti|ments, her Joy to &s;ee again the Marquis, after a cruel Captivity, which had appeared &s;o tedious to her, broke out in every Look and Action; &mdash; the happy Lover, on his Side, a&s;&s;ured her, that his Ab&s;ence from her was a Torment far greater than all the Hard&s;hips he had &s;uffered from his barbarous Ma&s;ters in <HI>Africa.</HI> A calm and &s;ettled Joy &s;ucceeded their fir&s;t Tran&s;ports at this happy Meeting, and in the pre&s;ent Satisfaction all Remem|brance of pa&s;t Evils was forgot.</P>
<P>Some Days afterwards, the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> went to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> to pay their Duty to his Maje&s;ty, and both re&s;olved to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endea|vours to obtain a Pardon for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> That Prince, who had been in|formed of their Captivity, had the Goodne&s;s to a&s;&s;ure them of his Concern for the Mi|&s;eries they had &s;uffered in <HI>Algiers</HI>; he com|manded the Count to give him a particular
<PB N="197" REF="198">
Relation of their Slavery, and the Treatment which they had received from the Infidels: the Count obeyed; and the great Heart of <HI>Henry</HI> was &s;en&s;ibly affected with the me|lancholy Detail. The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> &s;eeing his Maje&s;ty &s;o much moved, thought this a favourable Moment for the Chevalier; and continuing his Relation, he informed the King in what manner they were delivered from their Chains, and how greatly they had been obliged to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars,</HI> who had generou&s;ly undertaken a Voyage to <HI>Africa</HI> for their Service, and by his wi&s;e and prudent Conduct obtained their Liberty. Ob&s;erving the King &s;truck with &s;uch a noble In&s;tance of Friend&s;hip and Genero&s;ity, the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> entered in|to a Ju&s;tification of his Friend's Conduct with re&s;pect to his la&s;t Combat with the Count of <HI>Polan</HI>; he explained to his Ma|je&s;ty the Nece&s;&s;ity the Chevalier was under to take Notice of the Injury he received, which was publicly charged to the Count of <HI>Polan</HI>; he produced the Count's An&s;wer to the Challenge &s;ent him by the Chevalier, as a Proof of what he advanced. Then the Marquis and he throwing them&s;elves at the King's Feet, be&s;ought him to pardon the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> in Con&s;ideration of his great Valour, his inviolable Fidelity to his So|vereign, &mdash; his aimable Character, and the Wrong he had &s;uffered, by which he was provoked to take Revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">The King was a little &s;hook by their Intreaties, and the Arguments urged in Fa|vour of the Chevalier; but when he reflect|ed, that a Man whom all the Kingdom knew to be particularly dear to him, was killed by the Chevalier, in Defiance of his Edicts, and at the Hazard of mortally of|fending him, all the Solicitations of the Count and the Marquis could not prevail with him to pardon their Friend; they re|turned Home full of Grief for their bad Succe&s;s, and this Cloud that hung over the Chevalier's Fortune, embittered their Joys for their happy Return to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> were greatly afflicted at this Rigor of his Maje&s;ty, as they thought un|ju&s;tly exerted in the Ca&s;e of the Chevalier; but although their Affliction aro&s;e from Mo|tives very different in each, yet it was pretty near equal; for in a generous Heart Grati|tude produces Sentiments as tender as tho&s;e of Love. Mean time the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> pur&s;ued his good Fortune with Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI>: his Sufferings on her account, had augmented her Tenderne&s;s. She had made too full a Di&s;covery of her Sen|timents to the Counte&s;s, and even to her Lover him&s;elf, to indulge any farther female Parade, without incurring the Cen&s;ure of Af|fectation and Caprice. The Marquis, with a Lover's Ardor, pre&s;&s;ed for an early Day,&mdash; Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> but faintly de|nied.
<PB N="199" REF="200">
As &s;he was entirely Mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf and Fortune, &s;he could form no Excu&s;e for a longer Delay, &s;he therefore yielded to give the Marquis her Hand, as &s;oon as the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Preparations for their Marriage were made. The Counte&s;s was charmed with her ready Compliance; and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> obligingly a&s;&s;ured her, that the Happine&s;s &s;he propo&s;ed to her&s;elf in acquiring &s;uch a Si&s;ter, was not one of her lea&s;t Motives for &s;o &s;udden a Con&s;ent, though &s;he allowed to her Brother's faithful Pa&s;&s;ion, and her own Inclinations in his Fa|vour, their full Force.</P>
<P>Letters were immediately di&s;patched to <HI>Burgundy,</HI> to the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur</HI> and his Lady, acquainting them with Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin's</HI> Con&s;ent to give her Hand to their Son, which was an Event they had both earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for. In the expected Happine&s;s of &s;uch a Union, they buried all Remembrance of their pa&s;t Sor|rows for the Captivity of their only Son, and, although weakened with Age and Infirmities, they re&s;olved to take a Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> and honour with their Pre&s;ence the Solemnity of his Nuptials.</P>
<P>The old Nobleman and his Lady were in|finitely delighted to find the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars</HI> at their Son-in-law's Hotel. The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> pre&s;ented him to them with his u&s;ual Tenderne&s;s: the old Marquis embraced him
<PB N="200" REF="201">
with Tran&s;port, calling him the Pre&s;erver of him&s;elf and his Family; the Marchione&s;s re|ceived his Compliments with the Tenderne&s;s of a Mother to a worthy Son. The Chevalier politely begged, that he might be allowed to offer them his Hotel for their Re&s;idence, during their Stay in <HI>Paris.</HI>
<Q>Since, added he, &s;miling, the Count of <HI>Berci's</HI> Ho&s;pita|lity has obliged me to become an Inmate here.</Q>
The old Marquis and his Lady grate|fully accepted his Offer: they were conduct|ed thither in the Evening, by their Son, and the Count and Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI>; and the next Morning Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin</HI> went to pay her Re&s;pects to them.</P>
<P>The old Marquis and his Lady were charmed with the Beauty, good Sen&s;e, and Politene&s;s of their de&s;igned Daughter-in-law; they applauded their Son for his Choice, and not the le&s;s for having con&s;ulted, as they &s;up|po&s;ed, Fortune as well as external Qualities in that Choice. The young Marquis &s;uffered his Parents to attribute as much Prudence to him as they plea&s;ed, though his Heart told him, that Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin's</HI> For|tune, great as it was, was neverthele&s;s one of his lea&s;t Inducements for making his Addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>The Nuptials of the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmar|tin</HI> were celebrated with a Magnificence &s;uit|able to their Quality and Riches; but, alas,
<PB N="201" REF="202">
how was the Pomp of that Day's Ceremony darkened! What bitter Grief &s;ucceeded to their Joys! That Day was at once to the new married Couple and their Friends the happie&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable of their Lives.</P>
<P>The Ceremony of the Marriage performed, the Bride and Bridegroom, with their Rela|tions and Friends, went to the Hotel of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> where Mon&s;ieur and Madam <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> had cau&s;ed a &s;plen|did Entertainment to be prepared. At One o'Clock in the Morning the new married Pair retired; the re&s;t of the Company conti|nued dancing: but the Count and Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> after they had attended the Bride and Bridegroom to their Apartment, returned Home without taking Leave of the Com|pany, that they might not oblige them to break up.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> on account of the Di&s;grace he was in with the King, was not able to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this Day's Ceremony: he went early to Bed, but an unu&s;ual Inquietude, for which he could a&s;&s;ign no Cau&s;e, hindered him from Sleeping; he ro&s;e, and walked about his Chamber, and when he thought he had fatigued him&s;elf with that Exerci&s;e, he went again to Bed, but Sleep &s;till &s;led his Eyes, his Imagination was tortured with &s;ad and di&s;mal Images that would not leave him a Moment's Repo&s;e; he &s;tarted at every little Noi&s;e, without knowing why; his Heart beat
<PB N="202" REF="203">
in an unu&s;ual mea&s;ure; and he was preparing again to ri&s;e, when he heard the Count's Coach at the Gate.</P>
<P>The Arrival of the Count and Counte&s;s &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pend his Unea&s;ine&s;s; he heard them pa&s;s by his Antichamber, and he again endeavoured to take &s;ome Re&s;t. Mon&s;ieur and Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> after enquiring of the Che|valier's Health, retired to their own Chamber. <HI>Marianne,</HI> who&s;e Conduct had been &s;trictly ob&s;erved by her Lady ever &s;ince the Di&s;covery &s;he had made of her Amour, took Advantage of that Day's Solemnity, which &s;he concluded would keep the Count and Counte&s;s very late from Home, to admit her Lover once more into her Chamber; &s;he could not imagine they would return &s;o &s;oon as they did, but hearing the Coach, &s;he cau&s;ed <HI>Verague</HI> to dre&s;s him&s;elf ha&s;tily, and having concealed him in her Clo&s;et, &s;he pre&s;ented her&s;elf before her Lady with an a&s;&s;ured Countenance, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in undre&s;&s;ing her as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;he returned immediately to <HI>Verague,</HI> but would not &s;uffer him to attempt to go away till &s;he thought the Count and her Lady were a&s;leep. The Door of this Woman's Room opened into the Counte&s;s's Antichamber: <HI>Verague</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s through it to get to the back Stairs. When <HI>Marianne</HI> thought he might venture &s;afely, &s;he conducted him with as little Noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to the Door; however,
<PB N="203" REF="204">
the Count, who was not a&s;leep, heard his Steps; a fatal Curio&s;ity to know who it was pa&s;&s;ing &s;o late through his Lady's Apartment, made him ri&s;e, and, throwing his Night-gown over him, he went into the Antichamber. <HI>Verague</HI> had &s;topt there a Moment, to li&s;ten whether none of the Dome&s;tics were &s;till up: hearing the Count's Chamber-door open, he attempted to gain the Stair-ca&s;e, but with &s;o much Precipitation and Fear, that he made a fal&s;e Step upon the fir&s;t Stair, which gave the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> an Opportunity to lay hold on him. <HI>Verague,</HI> made de&s;perate by his Fears for his own Life, and the Di&s;honour of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, took a Poignard he wore in his Bo|&s;om when he went upon &s;uch Adventures, and endeavoured to di&s;engage him&s;elf from the Count by wounding him in the Arm, but the Count, by a &s;udden Motion, received the Stroke full in his Side. <HI>Verague</HI> now ea&s;ily breaking from his Hold, ran down Stairs, and climbing over the Walls of the Court-yard, which were very low, he got in|to a little Garden, of the Door of which <HI>Ma|rianne</HI> had given him a Key, and e&s;caped without Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The unhappy Count of <HI>Berci</HI> fell to the Ground with the Stroke he had received, and feeling his Blood flowing fa&s;t from his Wound, he called for Help with a loud Voice, His Gentleman, who&s;e Chamber was very near, and who happened to be up and read|ing, took up a Candle, and ran to the Place
<PB N="204" REF="205">
where his Lord's Voice had directed him. At the Sight of the Count extended upon the Ground, and covered with Blood, he made the Hou&s;e re&s;ound with his Cries: the Coun|te&s;s awaking in great Terrors, and not find|ing her Lord be&s;ide her, ha&s;tily aro&s;e, threw on a loo&s;e Robe, and calling <HI>Marianne,</HI> flew out of her Apartment, the Chevalier met her at the Head of the Stair-ca&s;e. What a Spectacle for the Wife and the Friend! the Count wel|tering in his Blood, &s;upported again&s;t the Wall, while his Gentleman was endeavour|ing to bind up his Wound with his Cravat.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> uttered a piercing Groan, and &s;unk down by her almo&s;t expiring Lord; the Chevalier, for &s;ome Moments, &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s with Grief and Amazement; the Ser|vants running from every Part of the Hou&s;e, were preparing to take up their bleeding Ma&s;ter, when the Chevalier, rou&s;ed from his &s;ilent Agony, eagerly lent his trembling Arm, and, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Gentleman, carried the Count into his Chamber, and laid him upon his Bed. Surgeons were immediate|ly &s;ent for, but he, feeling his Strength almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, turned his dying Eyes towards the Counte&s;s, who, &s;upported by her Women, &s;tood at his Bed&s;ide in Angui&s;h unutterable.</P>
<P><Q>Cea&s;e, Madam, &s;aid he to her, cea&s;e, to re&s;ign your&s;elf to a fruitle&s;s Grief, your Tears and your De&s;pair cannot re&s;tore me to your Love, but will embitter my la&s;t
<PB N="205" REF="206">
Moments. 'Tis done, I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, parting with you is all the Grief I feel in Death, but I return Thanks to Heaven for calling me away fir&s;t, and &s;pare|ing me the Affliction of &s;urviving you; we have lived happy in each other's Affection, I die contented, and I conjure you with my la&s;t Breath, not to revenge my Death.&mdash; I pardon the Authors of it, continued he, looking at <HI>Marianne,</HI> who was in vi&s;ible Agitations, nor mu&s;t you, my dear Coun|te&s;s, refu&s;e me another Reque&s;t, it is, &s;aid he taking the Chevalier's Hand, who &s;tood by him in an Agony of Grief, that after my Death, you will transfer the Affection you have borne me, to this dear, this faith|ful Friend, let him po&s;&s;e&s;s my Place in your Heart, ble&s;s him with your Hand, and both of you cheri&s;h my Remembrance.&mdash;May the God of all Mercies, pur&s;ued the dying Count, with Eyes fervently rai&s;ed to Heaven, pour down his choice&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings upon you, and grant me an A&s;ylum in the Bo&s;om of my&mdash;</Q>
He was not able to utter more, his Hand lo&s;t its Hold of the Chevalier, his Eyes for ever &s;hut out the Light, and faintly groaning he expired.</P>
<P>The Chevalier ordered the Counte&s;s's At|tendants to convey her in&s;tantly into another Chamber, that &s;he might not behold a Spec|tacle capable of &s;hocking her Rea&s;on. The Effects of her Grief were &s;o much the more to be apprehended, as it neither vented it|&s;elf
<PB N="206" REF="207">
in Tears or Complaint: her Eyes remain|ed always fixed on one Object, like a Per|&s;on in the la&s;t Agonies of Death; a mortal Palene&s;s over&s;pread her Face; for a while &s;he &s;eemed to have neither Sen&s;e or Motion; at length &s;he was &s;eized with Convul&s;ions, which held her &s;o long, that her Life was de|&s;paired of. It would have been happy for her had Fate then put a Period to her mi&s;erable Days; but &s;he was re&s;erved to &s;uffer greater Woes. By the Force of Medicines, &s;he re|covered to a Sen&s;e of Grief. Painful Return to Life! She now felt and deplored her Lo&s;s. The Chevalier &s;taid by her till the Convul|&s;ions had left her, and her Rea&s;on was a little re&s;tored; he neither could nor would attempt to con&s;ole her, that, he judged, mu&s;t be the Work of Time, and his Heart was too much oppre&s;&s;ed by his own Sorrows, to make him capable of admini&s;tring Comfort to another.</P>
<P>Mean time the News of this tragical Acci|dent was carried to the Hotel of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and changed the Mirth and Plea|&s;ures of the Ball into Tears and Lamentations: every one ran with di&s;tracted Ha&s;te to the Count's Hotel; an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination committed upon his Per&s;on in his own Hou&s;e, at the dead of Night, and by an unknown Hand, filled all who heard it with Horror and Amazement; a &s;trict Search was ordered to be made, but the Murderer could not be di&s;covered, all the Doors of the Hou&s;e were found fa&s;tened, nor was it po&s;&s;ible by any Circum&s;tance that ap|peared,
<PB N="207" REF="208">
to form any certain Judgment. All that could admit of no Doubt, was, that the Murder had been committed by one who had been all Night concealed in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>During all this Time, a thou&s;and gloomy Reflexions rolled in the Mind of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> the decea&s;ed Count's Brother. He was re&s;olved to &s;pend all the rich Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he was left Heir to, in di&s;covering the Authors of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and revenging it, he cau&s;ed all the Men Servants to be carried to Pri&s;on, and upon the Recital that was made him of his Brother's la&s;t words (for he was not pre&s;ent having &s;taid behind the Count and Counte&s;s at the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI>) of the meaning look he had ca&s;t upon <HI>Marianne,</HI> and the trouble and confu&s;ion it occa&s;ioned in her, he made her be taken up likewi&s;e and con|ducted to Pri&s;on, the Counts Servants went through the interrogatory, and the inno|cence was no le&s;s apparent by the &s;incere Grief they &s;hewed for the Lo&s;s of their Ma&s;ter, than their clear and unvarying an|&s;wers to the que&s;tions that were put to them.</P>
<P>When <HI>Marianne</HI> was examined, &s;he ab&s;o|lutely di&s;avowed having any Concern in the Murder, and to remove any Su&s;picions that might be entertained again&s;t her&s;elf or her Lover, &s;he declared to the Lieutenant cri|minel with an amazing Confidence that it was from the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> her&s;elf that they ought to &s;eek an Explanation of that

Horror, his E&s;teem and Affection for his Si&s;ter-in-law increa&s;ed in Proportion as he thought &s;he &s;uffered unju&s;tly in her character, he flew to inform her of the Order i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing her and exhorted her with Tears to &s;eek &s;ome A&s;ylum where &s;he might be &s;ecured again&s;t &s;o cruel an Affront.

<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci</HI> could not hear this af|fecting Apo&s;trophe to that infamous Slan|derer,
<PB N="211" REF="212">
without Tears, and Execrations. The Counte&s;s expre&s;&s;ed a grateful Acknowledg|ment for the Intere&s;t he took in her Mis|fortunes. She then de&s;ired him to &s;end the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to her, and as &s;oon as he entered her Apartment, &s;he related to him all that her Brother-in-law had told her, concerning the wicked <HI>Marianne</HI> and her own impending Danger.</P>
<P>The Chevalier was in Agonies at the Re|cital of &s;o horrid a Calumny. His Rage at the A&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon the Counte&s;s, and his Terrors at what might be the Con&s;equence of them, made him appear like one di&s;tracted, he traver&s;ed the Chamber with a furious Pace, forgetting that &s;he was pre&s;ent, and ca&s;ting up his Eyes to Heaven, &s;eemed to upbraid it for permitting &s;uch Virtue to &s;uffer. But recollecting him&s;elf at length, he approached the Counte&s;s with a calmer air, and a&s;ked her what in the pre&s;ent Exigence &s;he re&s;olved to do, begging her to command him freely who&s;e Life was wholly devoted to her Service.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s who had taken her Re&s;o|lution, replied with great compo&s;ure, that her Innocence was her Security, and that &s;he would &s;tand her Trial.</P>
<P>The Chevalier who had not expected &s;uch Firmne&s;s, was at fir&s;t lo&s;t in A&s;toni&s;hment and Admiration; but anxious for her Safety,
<PB N="212" REF="213">
and judging that there was no Time to lo&s;e, he repre&s;ented to her, that &s;he ought not to abandon, a Life &s;o precious, to the precarious Judgments of Men often unju&s;t, and cruel. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> alledged that her Flight would give her the Appearance of Guilt, that &s;he would rely entirely upon her Innocence, and the Interpo&s;ition of Providence, and wait patiently for the Event of &s;uch an un|de&s;erved Accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Chevalier finding her determined to expo&s;e her&s;elf to all the Dangers that threat|ened her, was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, he threw him&s;elf at her Feet and with Tears conjured her to take Mea&s;ures for pre&s;erving her&s;elf; but &s;he, unmoved with all he could &s;ay, ob|&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in her Re&s;olution to &s;uffer the horrors of Confinement in a dreadful Pri&s;on, the infamy of a publick Trial, and the Agony of a &s;hameful Death, if &s;uch was her Lot, and with ab&s;olute Re&s;ignation to the will of Heaven drink the bitter Cup that was prepared for her.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame Time that the Counte&s;s thus fearle&s;ly braved her own Fate, &s;he trembled at the Danger of a Man &s;o de&s;er|vedly dear to her, &s;he conjured him to fly and leave her to the Protection of Heaven, the Chevalier declared that he would &s;hare her Fate, whatever that might be; Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> intreated, wept, all was in vain. She then a&s;&s;umed an Appearance of Rage, and
<PB N="213" REF="214">
threatened never to pardon him, if he refu&s;ed to give her this la&s;t Proof of his obedience to her Will: even this was ineffectual. At la&s;t &s;he told him that her Intere&s;t required he &s;hould be &s;afe and at liberty, that he might be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, if her Enemies &s;hould bring Things to Extremity.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Thought made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Chevalier, he con&s;idered that if he &s;hould &s;uffer him&s;elf to be taken, the Count of <HI>Polan's</HI> friends would not fail to urge the King to have the Sentence he had pro|nounced executed upon him, &s;o that the Counte&s;s would be effectually deprived of all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he was able to give her, he had many great and powerful Friends, all of whom he could engage in the Intere&s;ts of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> while he continued free, but when he was once in cu&s;tody would have enough to do to procure his Pardon for the Death of the King's Favourite. He there|fore agreed to the Counte&s;s's Propo&s;al, de|termining within him&s;elf to die with her if he failed in his endeavours to &s;ave her.</P>
<P><Q>I go, Madam, &s;aid he, with Tears in his Eyes, in Obedience to your Commands: as long as I can be u&s;eful to you my Life will be worth my Care, and when it cea&s;es to be &s;o, I know how to die;</Q>
he ki&s;ed her Hand as he pronounced the&s;e words, and hur|rying out of her Apartment, met the two Marqui&s;&s;es <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who were come
<PB N="214" REF="215">
ha&s;tily to &s;ee the Counte&s;s; the Chevalier em|braced them affectionately, and recommend|ing Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> to their tender Cares, retired to the Hou&s;e of a faithful Friend, where he determined to wait the Effect of her Re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce been gone two Hours, when he was informed that the Counte&s;s had been arre&s;ted, and, notwith&s;tanding the vigorous Efforts of her Relations to &s;ave her from &s;uch an Ignominy, was conducted to the little Cha|telet; &s;he had been torn out of the Arms of her Father and the young Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who hung upon her, while her unhappy Mother &s;unk upon the Ground in a fainting Fit, at the Sight of the dreadful Officers of Ju&s;tice, who came to convey her to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Oh! blind and cruel Fortune, &s;hall Virtue ever be per&s;ecuted by thee, and thy &s;evere&s;t Malice be exerci&s;ed upon tho&s;e who mo&s;t de|&s;erve thy Smiles?</P>
<P>When the Counte&s;s entered the fatal Place which was henceforward to be her Habitation, the melancholy Gloom, the wretched Furni|ture, the grated Windows, the frightful So|litude, filled her Mind with Horrors, till then unfelt; all that Fortitude, the Pride of &s;uffer|ing Virtue, the &s;ecret Calm of con&s;cious In|nocence, upon which &s;he had depended, were too little to &s;upport her under &s;uch dreadful
<PB N="215" REF="216">
Circum&s;tances. She had now none of that boa&s;ted Courage left, which had le&s;&s;ened every Trial &s;he could be called to, and made her imagine her&s;elf more than equal to them all. Filled with Horror and De&s;pair, &s;he threw her &s;treaming Eyes around the mi&s;erable Room, &s;urveying it with di&s;tracted Eagerne&s;s, then &s;inking upon a Chair, and giving a loo&s;e to the Angui&s;h that oppre&s;&s;ed her, &s;he wrung her Hands, and &s;truck her groaning Brea&s;t.
<Q>Where art thou now, unhappy Wretch? cried &s;he; is thy once &s;plendid Fortune re|duced to this; an Inmate of a horrid Pri&s;on, confounded with the vile&s;t Criminals, branded with horrid Crimes, and threaten|ed with a &s;hameful Death? Ah, my deare&s;t Lord, pur&s;ued &s;he, was not the Remem|brance of thy unhappy Fate &s;ufficient to afflict me, but I mu&s;t be charged with being the Author of it? Ju&s;t Heaven, let me not find Fault with thy Decrees, &s;uffer not my rebellious Heart to murmur at my unde&s;erved Woes, let me &s;ubmit with Pa|tience to my De&s;tiny; and &s;ince I have lived with Innocence, let me die with Re&s;ignation.</Q></P>
<P>The Woman who had been appointed to attend the Counte&s;s, rather indeed to be a Spy upon her Behaviour, than to do her Ser|vice, could not hear this affecting Language without Tears. The Youth and Beauty of Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> had the Moment &s;he be|held her, excited her Compa&s;&s;ion, and in&s;en|&s;ibly
<PB N="216" REF="217">
removed that Prejudice which &s;he had conceived again&s;t a Woman charged with &s;o black a Crime; &s;he could not look on her, and imagine her capable of Cruelty, &s;he could not hear her, and believe her a Hypo|crite. After two or three Days Attendance upon her, &s;he di&s;covered &s;o much unaffected Piety in her Behaviour, &s;uch Gentlene&s;s of Manners, &s;uch perfect Re&s;ignation, and &s;uch a calm, yet &s;teady Courage, as per&s;uaded her &s;he was wholly innocent.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> &s;oon perceived, this Woman had entertained favourable Thoughts of her: her extreme A&s;&s;iduity to oblige her, the ten|der Concern &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for her Misfortunes, drew from the grateful Counte&s;s Acknow|ledgments that entirely won her Heart. The Unfortunate are ever ready to over-rate the Benefits they receive, becau&s;e they are unex|pected: Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> although &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf grateful in the highe&s;t Degree, yet had a Dignity in her Manner which enhanced the Value of her Conde&s;cen&s;ions. The Exi|gencies of her Situation required that &s;he &s;hould court the Friend&s;hip of this Woman, and &s;he &s;ucceeded without Difficulty, and without Humiliation: the Horrors of her Confinement were in &s;ome Degree moderated by this Incident; but the Shame and Di&s;|grace &s;he &s;uffered, and the Uncertainty of what might be her Fate, innocent as &s;he was, was &s;ufficient to overwhelm her with Sorrow. Death was not what &s;he dreaded, her Mi&s;e|ries
<PB N="217" REF="218">
had made Life hateful to her; but to die loaded with Infamy, to &s;uffer the Stroke of an Executioner, upon a public Scaffold, brand|ed with the Crimes of Adultery and Murder, &s;hocked her almo&s;t to Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>After a Week's Impri&s;onment, the Lieute|nant Criminal entered &s;uddenly into her Cham|ber, in order to interrogate her: &s;he trembled at fir&s;t at the Sight of this au&s;tere Magi&s;trate; the Thoughts of being obliged to an&s;wer like a Criminal, in a Po&s;ture &s;o unworthy of her Quality and Innocence, threw her into &s;ome Confu&s;ion: but here her Piety came to her Aid; &s;he humbled her&s;elf under the cha&s;ti&s;ing Hand of the Almighty, and, with a perfect Submi&s;&s;ion to his Will, &s;uffered the igno|minious Examination; &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the Ad|venture of the Fore&s;t, and the Interview &s;he had had with the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan,</HI> but &s;he took God to Wit|ne&s;s for the Innocence of her Intentions, and her Conduct. The Judge, after taking her Confe&s;&s;ion in writing, which he read to her, and &s;he &s;igned, withdrew.</P>
<P>Neither the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> nor <HI>Marianne</HI> had made any mention of <HI>Verague,</HI> in their Examinations: that A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was carefully con|cealed in <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of one of his near Relations. He &s;taid there for &s;ome Days, to &s;ee what Turn the Affair would take; but though he found him&s;elf in Safety, he was tortured with the Stings of his own Guilt.
<PB N="218" REF="219">
This Man was a Gentleman by Birth: he had not hitherto committed any flagrant Crimes; the Terror he was in, le&s;t the Re|putation of his Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould be bla&s;ted, made him de&s;perate, he found he could not di&s;engage him&s;elf from the Count, who held him fa&s;t, and called aloud for Lights; his Si|tuation gave him not Time for Reflexion, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould &s;peedily e&s;cape for the Pre&s;ervation of his own Life and his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Honour, and he could no other ways effect it than by ridding him&s;elf of the Count; guided by a &s;udden Impul&s;e, he &s;tabbed him with his Poignard, but aimed the Stroke at the Arm which held him, the unfortunate Count received it in his Brea&s;t; and <HI>Verague</HI> fled full of Horror at the Action he had committed, and Fear of the Con&s;equences. When he found, that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> were accu&s;ed of the Mur|der of the Count, his Heart was touched with Remor&s;e, but he had neither Fortitude nor Genero&s;ity enough to clear their Innocence, by confe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of that un|happy Nobleman. He could not, however, endure to be in a Place which every Moment recalled to him the Remembrance of his Crime, for which two innocent Per&s;ons were per&s;ecuted; he was apprehen&s;ive likewi&s;e, that <HI>Marianne,</HI> terrified at the fatal Con&s;e|quences of her Guilt, would endeavour to re|pair the Mi&s;chiefs &s;he had been the Cau&s;e of, and would deliver him up to Ju&s;tice: but he judged too favourably of that hardened
<PB N="219" REF="220">
Wretch, the Per&s;ecution &s;he &s;aw the Counte&s;s &s;uffer, gratified her Malice, while it &s;ecured her Safety. She could never forgive her for the &s;evere Reproaches &s;he made her on ac|count of her Amour with <HI>Verague,</HI> and for the Re&s;olution &s;he had taken to di&s;mi&s;s her from her Service.</P>
<P>It is one of the greate&s;t Triumphs of Vice to behold Virtue in Di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Marianne</HI> exult|ed in her own Mind over her &s;uffering Lady, and hardened her&s;elf in her Crime by re|flecting on the Advantages &s;he had now over that &s;crupulous Virtue, which, rather than wink at her Failings, had expo&s;ed its Owner, though innocent, to all the Con&s;equences of detected Guilt. But <HI>Verague,</HI> who had not even tru&s;ted her with the Place of his Con|cealment, did not know the full Extent of his Wickedne&s;s, and was ignorant of his own Security: he therefore re&s;olved to leave <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> and &s;helter him&s;elf in <HI>England</HI>; but Change of Place could bring no Relief to the Tortures of his Mind, the Blood he had &s;hed haunted his Imagination with Horrors, which made that Life he feared to lo&s;e, in|&s;upportable to him, and the Dangers the in|nocent Counte&s;s was expo&s;ed to through his Crime, gave new Stings to a Con&s;cience &s;uf|ficiently wounded before.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant Criminal was extremely concerned to find that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars</HI> had e&s;caped his Vigilance: the &s;tricte&s;t
<PB N="220" REF="221">
Search imaginable was made for him, but to no Purpo&s;e; he was perfectly &s;afe in the A&s;y|lum he had cho&s;e, but devoured with Melan|choly, and a Prey to the mo&s;t bitter Reflec|tions, the Murder of his Friend, the Suffer|ings of his beloved Counte&s;s, were never out of his Thoughts, and almo&s;t overturned his Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more real Delicacy and Greatne&s;s of Mind than half her Sex, had never, when pre&s;&s;ed by her Brother-in-law to receive <HI>Marianne</HI> again in|to her Service, taken the lea&s;t Notice to him of the Cau&s;e for which &s;he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her: he therefore was wholly ignorant of her In|trigue with <HI>Verague.</HI> She was &s;ilent like|wi&s;e upon that Head when &s;he was interro|gated by the Lieutenant Criminal: her Ago|nies, when &s;he beheld her Lord wounded to Death, and weltering in his Blood, were too great to &s;uffer her Attention to be free enough to ob&s;erve the con&s;cious Look he gave <HI>Ma|rianne,</HI> and the Confu&s;ion it cau&s;ed in that wicked Girl. At times indeed &s;he had &s;ome Su&s;picions of the Truth, but as they were only Su&s;picions, &s;he did not think her&s;elf au|thorized to accu&s;e any one. Her Pride &s;ug|ge&s;ted to her likewi&s;e, that &s;he &s;hould level her&s;elf with her infamous Servant, to retort Scandal for Scandal, &s;ince &s;he had no Means of proving her A&s;&s;ertions, and <HI>Marianne</HI> had the Advantage of having fir&s;t accu&s;ed her, which &s;he thought would render every thing
<PB N="221" REF="222">
&s;he afterwards &s;aid, &s;u&s;pected; this fal&s;e Rea|&s;oning was the Source of all her Mi&s;eries: had &s;he di&s;covered her vile Woman's Amour with <HI>Verague</HI>; his Flight, with &s;everal other con|curring Circum&s;tances, would have made him known to have been the Author of her Lord's A&s;&s;i&s;&s;ination; but &s;he her&s;elf was ignorant of his having left <HI>France,</HI> and as none of her Fa|mily knew of his Connexion with <HI>Marianne,</HI> it was a Circum&s;tance not attended to by them, and if not by them, no other Per&s;on had any Concern in it. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> tru&s;ting her Ju&s;tification to Providence, con|&s;oled her&s;elf with the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her In|nocence; and in her Piety and Re&s;ignation to the Will of Heaven, found a Support that enabled her to undergo her Afflictions.</P>
<P>Mean time the Chevalier never one Mo|ment forgot the lovely Pri&s;oner: as he could not &s;olicit her Cau&s;e openly, he engaged all his Friends in her Intere&s;t; the Ardor and Zeal with which they undertook her Defence, were &s;o much the greater, as they were con|vinced of her Innocence, and that of their Friend; even the Public, though often very unju&s;t in its Cen&s;ures, could not be per&s;uaded that this brave Man was capable of commit|ting a Crime, &s;o unworthy of his Courage, his Genero&s;ity, and his Birth, tho&s;e only who were Strangers to his Fame and his great Qualities, and the Friends of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> whom he had killed in his la&s;t Duel,
<PB N="222" REF="223">
were capable of &s;aying that he was the Author of &s;o dete&s;table an Action.</P>
<P>The two Marque&s;&s;es <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> were inconceivably afflicted for the Misfortunes of the Counte&s;s; but her Mother and her new Si&s;ter-in-law were in a Condition truly pitiable: the Sorrow of that tender Friend for the unde&s;erved Sufferings of Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was equal to that of her who had given her Birth. Under what fatal Au&s;pices had <HI>Hymen</HI> lighted his Torch for her? Her Nup|tials re&s;embled a Funeral rather than a Bridal Solemnity: Tears, Groans, and agonizing Aprehen&s;ions left no room for Love or Joy. None of the Relations of Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> en|tertained the &s;lighte&s;t Su&s;picion of her Virtue; they were alike convinced of the Honour and Probity of the Chevalier; they knew where he lay concealed, and often vi&s;ited him, to lament the hard Fate of the innocent Counte&s;s, and to concert Mea&s;ures for her Relief.</P>
<P>That unfortunate Lady was not allowed the Con&s;olation of &s;eeing her Friends; her Father and Mother were denied Permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her. Yet amid&s;t this complicated Mi&s;ery, her Mind was compo&s;ed, her Behaviour expre&s;&s;ed a calm and decent Sorrow, and in that the Death of her Lord had greater Part than her own Di&s;|grace and Danger.</P>
<P>The old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> although he had a great Opinion of his Daughter's Vir|tue,
<PB N="223" REF="224">
and the highe&s;t Veneration for the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI>; yet was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, when he was informed of the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Marianne's</HI> Depo&s;ition, concerning the Chevalier's Pa&s;&s;ion for his Daughter. He re|&s;olved to get &s;ome Explanation of this Mat|ter from him: for which Purpo&s;e he went alone to vi&s;it him one Day; and entering immediately upon the Point, he told him, that the only Circum&s;tance which made his Daughter's Innocence doubtful, were the vio|lent Pre&s;umptions formed again&s;t her by the Judges on account of the Pa&s;&s;ion he was &s;aid to have entertained for her, and which was proved by the Depo&s;itions of the Count's Brother and her Woman.</P>
<P>The Chevalier was in &s;ome little Confu|&s;ion at this Di&s;cour&s;e; he blu&s;hed, and ca&s;t down his Eyes, for a few Moments he was &s;ilent, and in terrible Unea&s;ine&s;s. The old Marquis, in great Agitations, pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;peak: the Chevalier di&s;dained a Lie, re-a&s;|&s;uring him&s;elf therefore in a Moment, he re|plied with that Confidence which is always the Companion of Innocence, and Rectitude of Mind:</P>
<P><Q>It is true, my Lord, I do love the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> your Daughter; I loved her before I knew her unfortunate Lord, who&s;e Death you cannot more &s;incerely lament than I do. Her Beauty charmed me while I was yet ignorant of her being married,

and when I knew it, her Wi&s;dom and Vir|tue rivetted my Chains. She might po&s;&s;ibly have been ignorant of this Pa&s;&s;ion till now, had I not di&s;covered it by my Complaints in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Beauplan.</HI> I did not imagine I could be overheard amid&s;t the Solitude of that va&s;t Fore&s;t: I freely di&s;burthened my Heart; and Chance brought the Counte&s;s and her Brother-in-law within Hearing. That young Lord for his Si&s;ter's Ju&s;tifica|tion, ought to have remembered that I ex|pre&s;&s;ed the &s;incere&s;t Friend&s;hip for the Count, which my Actions have &s;ince proved; that I trembled le&s;t my involun|tary Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould offend the Virtue I adored; and that I hoped for no other Re|ward than her Compa&s;&s;ion. I acknowledge farther, that I once had a private Interview with the Counte&s;s in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beauplan:</HI> &s;he granted me this Favour, in Con&s;idera|tion of the Service I had the good For|tune to do you. I had no Intention of making a Merit with her by that Service, as you, my Lord, well know, by my Soli|citude to conceal my Name. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> &s;aw me indeed, but it was to reprove me for my mi&s;placed Love; &s;he convinced me I could never hope to obtain any Favour of her incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t Duty and tendere&s;t Affection to her Lord; and what is more, &s;he brought me my&s;elf to de|&s;ire no other, to be contented with her Friend&s;hip, and to aim at no higher Satis|faction than the Glory of &s;erving her Lord,

and giving her &s;uch Proofs of my Pa&s;&s;ion, as the &s;evere&s;t Virtue mu&s;t not only not condemn, but approve. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the Judges &s;hould reflect upon the whole Tenor of my Conduct with regard to the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> yet impute his Murder to me? Was it probable, that I would take a Voyage to <HI>Africa,</HI> in which I run the Ri&s;que of being delivered up to the Laws of my Country, which I had offended by kil|ling the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> or of being made a Slave my&s;elf, to deliver the Count from his Fetters, only to become his A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in? Did I expo&s;e my Life, to &s;ave his, at the Siege of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> only to deprive him of it by a Midnight Murder when I returned into <HI>France?</HI> Ah! my Lord, do me the Ju&s;tice to believe that I mention not the&s;e Things with any other View but to clear the Innocence of the Counte&s;s, and to de|fend my own Honour from the unju&s;t Cen|&s;ures that have been ca&s;t upon it. Yon Star that gilds the Firmament, is not clearer than your Daughter's Virtue, nor more &s;potle&s;s than her Mind. He who reads Hearts, who knows our Thoughts as they ri&s;e &s;ponta|neous in the Mind, can witne&s;s how pure mine have been with regard to the Counte&s;s your Daughter. Ah! my Lord, if my Pa&s;|&s;ion for that virtuous Lady had been crimi|nal, if it had &s;ugge&s;ted ba&s;e De&s;ires, I &s;hould have rejoiced at the Captivity of her Lord, and not have expo&s;ed my&s;elf to Slavery to redeem him; to &s;ave him from Death, I

&s;hould not have run between him and his Enemies, and received the Strokes aimed at his, upon my own Brea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Dear Chevalier, interrupted the old Mar|quis, convinced by the Force of the&s;e Rea|&s;ons, forgive me for the Nece&s;&s;ity I have laid you under of defending that Honour and Ge|nero&s;ity of which my whole Family has had &s;uch &s;triking Proofs; I am a&s;hamed that I have for one Moment &s;uffered a Doubt to ri&s;e in my Mind concerning your Love for my Daughter: that Love mu&s;t have been honourable and pure; for mean and ba&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions could never have a Place in &s;uch a noble Mind.&mdash; Once more forgive me, and allow me to hope that I have not forfeited your Friend&s;hip by this Trial of your Good|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier made no other An&s;wer than a &s;trict Embrace to which the old Marquis had invited him, as he uttered the&s;e la&s;t Words, by opening his Arms, and going towards him. Tears of Joy and Tenderne&s;s fell from the Chevalier's Eyes at the reco|vered good Opinion of the Father of her, whom he &s;o religiou&s;ly adored; but the&s;e plea&s;|ing Emotions &s;oon gave Way to others, cau|&s;ed by the Remembrance of the Counte&s;s's Sufferings. They conferred together upon what Mea&s;ures were proper to be taken to remove the Prejudices of the Judges: but all their Efforts were to no Purpo&s;e, the &s;up|po&s;ed

Amour between the Chevalier and the Counte&s;s, gave every Thing &s;o black an Ap|pearance on the Side of the Lovers, that tho&s;e Magi&s;trates i&s;&s;ued an Order for Madam <HI>de Berci</HI>'s being put to the Que&s;tion to force her to reveal what &s;he knew of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of her Lord.</P>
<P>When this News was brought to the Family <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> the Grief they had hitherto &s;uffered on account of her Impri&s;on|ment was &s;o light to that they now felt that they thought they had never been mi&s;erable till now, the whole Hou&s;e was filled with Cries and Lamentations, the unhappy Mother beat her groaning Brea&s;t, and pro&s;trate on the Ground in agoni&s;ing Sorrow, be&s;eeched Heaven to have Mercy upon her Child. But the unfini&s;hed Prayer &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed her Lips when the Image of her Daughter's threatned Pains ri&s;ing to her tortured Imagination, her Grief ro&s;e up to fren&s;y, wildly &s;he rent her reverend Hairs, and wrung her Hands, ca&s;ting by Intervals her &s;treaming Eyes to Heaven, from whence &s;he only hoped Relief: the young Marchione&s;s in the Arms of her Woman, fell into &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Faintings that made them tremble for her Life, the two Marqui&s;&s;es <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> endeavoured to con&s;ole the Ladies, but wanted them&s;elves the Support they would have given.</P>
<P>But no Words can de&s;cribe the mingled Rage, De&s;pair, and Angui&s;h which took

Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Chevalier's Soul at the dreadful News, the very Idea of torturing that lovely Frame, drove him almo&s;t to Di&s;traction, he could not bear to think her Ears had been wounded with the ignominious Sentence; regardle&s;s of his Safety he quitted his Retreat and flew to his own Hotel, where the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and his Fa|mily &s;till re&s;ided. The Sight of his afflicted Friends gave him up for a few Moments to Tears:.. they could not &s;peak to each other, no one could bear to mention the horrid Sentence. The Chevalier at length recollect|ing him&s;elf, and &s;tarting as if newly awaked from a frightful Dream, approached the wretched Mother and taking her Hand with a Countenance and Tone of Voice, that darted a Ray of Comfort into her Soul, thus &s;poke to her.</P>
<P><Q>Heaven, Madam, has in&s;pired me with a De&s;ign which may relieve the Counte&s;s, and re&s;tore you tranquility, &s;u&s;pend your Grief for a few Days and depend upon it, I will &s;ave her or peri&s;h in the Attempt.</Q>
The old Marchione&s;s could only pre&s;s his Hand, and by an ardent Ejaculation, implore the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven upon his Enter|prize, the Chevalier then taking the two Marqui&s;&s;es a&s;ide, told them that it being now near the End of Advent it was pro|bable the ignominious Sentence might be put in Execution before <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> he there|fore de&s;ired he would &s;olicit the King, to put
<PB N="229" REF="230">
off by his Authority, the Deci&s;ion of the Proce&s;s, till after Twelfth-night. In great Afflictions it is natural for the Mind to fa&s;ten upon any thing that affords the lea&s;t Probability of Relief: the well known Courage of the Che|valier, his enterprizing Temper, and the Prudence and Fortitude which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a very high Degree, gave &s;uch Force to his A&s;&s;urances, that he would deliver the Counte&s;s from her Confinement, though with the Lo&s;s of his Life, if that &s;hort Interval could be obtained, that they readily, and not without &s;ome Degree of Hope, and Comfort, undertook, to procure, by the Mediation of their Friends, the required Delay. In Effect, the King, who&s;e Indulgence for the charm|ing Sex, made up a great Part of his Charac|ter, was prevailed upon to interpo&s;e his Au|thority, to procure the unhappy Counte&s;s this &s;hort Relief. The Chevalier was over|ioyed, and immediately began to execute the Project he had formed.</P>
<P>Between the little Chatelet and the Bridge there is a Street inhabited only by Butchers, whither no one comes but &s;uch as have Oc|ca&s;ion to purcha&s;e Meat, becau&s;e it is not a Thoroughfare. The Chevalier, having long before been informed that the Chamber in which the unfortunate Counte&s;s was confined, looked into this Street, had, upon that Cir|cum&s;tance, laid the Foundation of his De&s;ign. Having put on a plain Dre&s;s, and turned up his own fine Hair under a Wig, which &s;erved
<PB N="230" REF="231">
for a tolerable Di&s;gui&s;e, he went very early in the Morning to this little Street, as at that Hour there was no Probability that any one would come to buy Provi&s;ions: he walked lei&s;urely down it to take a View of the Situa|tion of the Counte&s;s's Pri&s;on, and ob&s;erved that a Grate of the Chatelet looked upon a Window of a Hou&s;e which was &s;o near it, that there was only the Breadth of that Street between them; the Grate was in|deed a little higher than the Window. The Chevalier was approaching this Hou&s;e, when he ob&s;erved that the Mi&s;tre&s;s of it was em|ployed in opening her Shop; the Woman, &s;truck with his Air and Mien, notwith&s;tand|ing the Plainne&s;s of his Dre&s;s, was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a Per&s;on whom &s;he concluded to be of &s;ome Rank, at that early Hour, in an unfre|quented Street. But the Chevalier did not give her Time to make many reflections; he acco&s;ted her with great Civility, and told her it was in her Power to do him a very con&s;iderable Service, which he would not fail to reward generou&s;ly, and, as an Earne&s;t of what he would farther do for her, in Ca&s;e &s;he was &s;o good as to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, he begged &s;he would accept that Trifle, &s;aying which he put a Pur&s;e that contained fifty Crowns, in her Hand. The Woman was a&s;toni&s;hed at the Value of &s;uch a Pre&s;ent, which conciliated her good Will, even more than the in&s;inuating Per&s;on and Addre&s;s of the Chevalier, though Beauty never fails to have its due Weight
<PB N="231" REF="232">
with that Sex. She de&s;ired him to come in, and was prudent enough not to let him &s;tand in the Shop, for fear of Ob&s;ervation; for &s;he found her Intere&s;t engaged in this &s;trange Gentleman's Bu&s;ine&s;s, whatever it might be, and that made her extremely wary. The Chevalier joyfully accepted of her Invitation; he followed her into the little Room &s;he led to, and after prefacing his Story with &s;ome Prai&s;es of her Benevolence, which he accom|panied with a Salute and a gentle Pre&s;&s;ure of her Hand, that extremely prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her in his Favour; for Women in her low Cla&s;s think them&s;elves highly honoured by &s;uch Sort of Notice, from Men of the Rank the Cheva|lier appeared to be; he told her, that in the Chatelet there was Pri&s;oner a Lady who was a near Relation of his; that he had the Ma|nagement of her Affairs, but that &s;he had been &s;o clo&s;ely confined for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, that he had not been able to give her any In|formations concerning her Proce&s;s, nor to re|ceive any In&s;tructions from her, all which was extremely prejudicial to her Cau&s;e. He a&s;&s;ured her, that the Favour he required of her, could be productive of no Inconvenience either to her or her Hu&s;band, it being only to lend him for two or three Days a Room in her Hou&s;e that was oppo&s;ite to the Grate; the U&s;e, he intended to make of it, he &s;aid, was to convey a Letter to his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Rela|tion, to give her Notice of &s;omething which was of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to her Safety. He concluded, with a&s;&s;uring her, that if God,
<PB N="232" REF="233">
through her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould enable him, as he hoped, to ju&s;tify the Innocence of the La|dy, he would give her a much more con&s;ider|able Proof of his Gratitude than that &s;he had already received.</P>
<P>The Populace of <HI>Paris</HI> are naturally com|pa&s;&s;ionate, they are always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t any one in the Circum&s;tances the Chevalier de|&s;cribed this Lady to be in, when it is to co&s;t them nothing, but when for that A&s;&s;i&s;tance Gratuities &s;o con&s;iderable as the Chevalier's Pre&s;ent, are offered, there is nothing but what may be expected from their obliging Of|ficiou&s;ne&s;s. The Woman, won by the Sum &s;he had in Hand, and the flattering Hopes of a much greater, offered the Chevalier not on|ly that Room, but her whole Hou&s;e, if it could be of any Service to him, a&s;&s;uring him &s;he would keep his Secret faithfully, which the Chevalier, having engaged her &s;o far in his Intere&s;ts, had no Rea&s;on to doubt. She began immediately to make good her Pro|mi&s;es, and conducted the Chevalier into the Room he de&s;ired to be &s;hewn to. The Hu&s;|band, upon hearing them there, ran to &s;ee who was with his Wife. She was young, and tolerably hand&s;ome: his Jealou&s;y was awaken|ed at the Sight of a fine Gentleman in Con|ference with her, and he did not fail to give &s;ome Marks of his Di&s;&s;atisfaction, but this la&s;ted no longer than till he was informed of the Occa&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;u&s;pected Vi&s;it; the Sight of fifty Crowns in&s;tantly di&s;pelled the
<PB N="233" REF="234">
Cloud on his Brow, and he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his Wife in Civility, intreating the Gentleman to be a&s;&s;ured that him&s;elf and all he had was at his Service. At any other Time the Chevalier would have &s;miled at &s;uch a &s;udden Tran&s;ition from Di&s;gu&s;t to a Profu&s;ion of Kindne&s;&s;es; but the Importance of his De&s;ign filled all his Thought. The Butcher told him, that the Chamber which had that Grate in it, was the be&s;t in the Chatelet, where only Per|&s;ons of Quality were u&s;ed to be confined; and that he believed there was at pre&s;ent in it a Lady of Di&s;tinction, who was accu&s;ed of being concerned with a Gallant in the A&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination of her Hu&s;band. The Chevalier could not help &s;ighing at the&s;e Words, but recol|lecting him&s;elf, he de&s;ired the Man with great Compo&s;ure, to bring him the nece&s;&s;ary Materials for writing, his only View being to convey a Letter to the Hands of his Kin&s;|woman. The Butcher flew to get him what he wanted, and the Chevalier having fini&s;hed his Letter, fa&s;tened it to a &s;mall Cord, toge|ther with a little Inkhorn, &s;ome Paper, and a Pen. The Grate was double-barred, and very clo&s;e, he &s;aw it would be very difficult to throw in this little Packet, however he flung it &s;everal times, directing it as near as po&s;&s;ible to the Mark, at la&s;t it had the good Fortune to enter; he let go the Packthread, that the Counte&s;s might draw it all in through this Grate. That unhappy Lady was upon her Knees ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to it; &s;he &s;aw &s;omething fall on the Ground, and her Imagination be|ing
<PB N="234" REF="235">
heated with the Fervency of her Devo|tion, &s;he concluded that Heaven had heard her Prayer, and had &s;ent her Comfort. She took up the Packet immediately, and drew in the re&s;t of the Packthread, which was hang|ing on the Out&s;ide of her Chamber. The Paper, the Inkhorn, and the Pen, which &s;he &s;aw tied up all together, &s;urpri&s;ed her at fir&s;t; for the Confu&s;ion of her Thoughts were &s;o great that &s;he could not gue&s;s for what Rea|&s;on tho&s;e Things were &s;ent her: but when &s;he opened the Chevalier's Letter, her Appre|hen&s;ion was a little quickened. It contained the&s;e Words:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>'MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>Although I would &s;acrifice my Life, to free you from the &s;malle&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, yet at pre&s;ent I rather chu&s;e to increa&s;e your Grief, by informing you of the Dangers with which you are threatened, than lo&s;e, by my Silence, the Means of delivering you from them. But, ah! Madam, how can I write the Words? You are to be &s;entenced immediately after Twelfth-night. Your Cou|rage, your Fortitude, your glorious Re&s;ig|nation, what will they all avail you again&s;t the cruel Fate that is preparing for you. But I cannot, will not, blot a Paper, which I hope will reach your lovely Hands, with the ab|horred Sentence. Let me conjure you, Ma|dam, by the heart-breaking Sorrows of your wretched Mother, by your Father's An|gui&s;h, the Tears of your new Si&s;ter, the
<PB N="235" REF="236">
Di&s;tre&s;s of your noble Brother, by the Af|fliction of all your Friends, who take &s;uch tender Intere&s;t in your Sufferings, do not oppo&s;e my Endeavours to &s;et you free. I am authori&s;ed by your unhappy Parents to make &s;ome Attempt to &s;ave you; oh! be not blinded by fal&s;e Honour to throw away a Life &s;o precious. Let me have your Con&s;ent to deliver you, and hope every Thing from Heaven's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and my Zeal to &s;erve you. I am now waiting for your An&s;wer; as &s;oon as you have wrote it, throw it out of your Grate, without troubling your&s;elf about its Fate, only give me Permi&s;&s;ion, Madam, to &s;ave a Life upon which my own &s;o ab&s;olutely depends.</Q></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s read this Letter with a Va|riety of &s;trong Emotions: her Heart felt an involuntary Tran&s;port at this new Proof of the Chevalier's Tenderne&s;s and Con&s;tancy. She well knew his natural Intrepidity, and did not doubt but he was capable of under|taking any Enterpri&s;e to pre&s;erve her. That good Fortune which had hitherto always at|tended him in any hazardous Attempt, &s;eem|ed to promi&s;e him Succe&s;s in this: &s;he could not think of being delivered from that Place of Horror, without indulging a momentary Joy, heigthened with the Reflexion that the Man to whom &s;he was mo&s;t willing to be obliged, would be her Deliverer. But this la&s;t Thought gave Ri&s;e to another, which filled her with Confu&s;ion and Unea&s;ine&s;s:
<PB N="336" REF="237">
&s;he recollected, that this Deliverer, &s;o dear to her, was, in the Opinion of the World, the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of her Hu&s;band; if &s;he accepted his offered Services, would it not confirm that horrid Su&s;picion, and be productive of Dangers to both? She could not bear the Thought of giving &s;uch a Sanction to the vile Reports that were &s;pread of a guilty Commerce between her and the Chevalier, as the flying from her Pri&s;on would do. No, cried &s;he weeping, let me die with the Satisfaction of having done nothing to de|&s;erve the cruel Cen&s;ures that have been pa&s;t upon me. In vain &s;he endeavoured to fortify her&s;elf again&s;t the Fears of Death, by a Con|&s;ideration of what &s;he owed her Honour: the very Idea of the cruel and ignominious Tor|ture &s;he was to &s;uffer, overthrew all her Con&s;tancy; and now wholly engro&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e Terrors, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;uffer no more Scruples to ri&s;e in her Mind, but rather hazard the Lo&s;s of her Reputation for a little Time, than lo&s;e it effectually, together with her Life. She had not &s;ufficiently attended to the Force of the Chevalier's former Argu|ments again&s;t her tru&s;ting to the Judgments of Men, which cannot but be fallible. She had not Time to reflect on the Con&s;equences of the Step &s;he had determined to take. In that Enthu&s;ia&s;m, in&s;pired by Innocence and Grief, &s;he braved her Fate, and only &s;en&s;ible to Di&s;honour, feared neither the Horrors of a Pri&s;on, nor the threatened Death. Doubt|le&s;s, her Mind had been &s;upported with the
<PB N="337" REF="238">
Hope that her Innocence would be manife&s;t|ed in &s;pite of the Malice of her Accu&s;ers, and that a &s;hort Di&s;grace would be recompen&s;ed by a noble Te&s;timony to her Honour. But her Situation was now greatly altered, her Fame was wounded deeply, her Puni&s;hment was certain, and not far off.</P>
<P>One rea&s;ons very differently when a Dan|ger is near and unavoidable, from what one does while it is yet doubtful, and only threatens at a Di&s;tance. The Love of Life, &s;o natural to a young and beautiful Woman, who&s;e Heart was filled with the &s;ofte&s;t of all Pa&s;&s;ions, repelled every other Thought but what tended to her own Pre&s;ervation: &s;he no longer deferred taking her Re&s;olution, it was to live, whatever Con&s;truction the World might put upon her Conduct. She made u&s;e of the Materials the Chevalier had &s;ent her for writing, and an&s;wered his Letter in the following Manner:</P>
<P><Q>I will abandon my&s;elf entirely to your generous Cares and ardent De&s;ire to &s;erve me, provided, that after you have delivered me from this Place of Horror, you will im|mediately re&s;ign me to my Father's Protec|tion; the Enterprize you have engaged in, is generous and noble, but, alas, Chevalier, it is very difficult to execute, but remem|ber, that I expect you will act with &s;o much Prudence, that while you are endea|vouring to pre&s;erve my Life, you may not
<PB N="238" REF="239">
endanger your own. Re&s;train the Impetuo|&s;ity of your Courage: in Affairs of this Na|ture the Arts of Contrivance are mo&s;t wanted. Adieu, Chevalier. I &s;hall be full of Anxiety, till I hear from you again.</Q></P>
<P>Although the Counte&s;s had entirely gained the Heart of the Woman who had been put about her, yet &s;he did not think proper to impart her Secret to her &s;o &s;oon, &s;he only told her, that a Friend, who was greatly in|tere&s;ted in her Misfortunes, had found Means to convey a Letter to her, to comfort her under her &s;evere Trials. The Plea&s;ure the Woman expre&s;&s;ed at hearing this &s;mall Piece of good Fortune for the Counte&s;s, made her, with good Rea&s;on, judge, that when Matters were riper &s;he might &s;afely engage her A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The Chevalier mean time &s;uffered great Unea&s;ine&s;s and Perplexity, while the Counte&s;s was employed in deliberating what Part &s;he &s;hould take; and afterwards, in writing her An&s;wer, the poor Chevalier, tor|tured with Anxiety, planted him&s;elf at the Chamber-window: his Eyes were continually turned towards the fatal Grate; he trembled le&s;t he had mi&s;taken the Room where the Counte&s;s was confined, and that the Letter had fallen into other Hands. But at length, after being long racked between Expectation and Fear, he &s;aw a Bit of Paper fall into the Street, his Heart bounded to his Mouth, with trembling Impatience he ran down the Stairs to take it up, but could not come Time
<PB N="239" REF="240">
enough to prevent a Bailiff who had un|fortunately entered that Shop to buy &s;ome Meat, from &s;eizing the Paper, which he was opening, when the Chevalier approached him, and de&s;ired him very civily to give it to him, &s;aying, it was a Paper he him&s;elf had let fall. The Bailiff's Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Con|tents of that Paper, was greatly heightened by the apparent Agitation of the Chevalier: he was a little &s;low in returning it; the Che|valier almo&s;t di&s;tracted with his Fears of what might happen from &s;uch an unlucky Circum|&s;tance, &s;taid no longer to intreat, but &s;natcht the Paper out of his Hands, and run away as fa&s;t as his Legs could carry him, behind the Chatelet, on that Side near the Church of <HI>Notre Dame,</HI> with all the other Bailiffs who were then at the Barriere, and a confu&s;ed Rabble at his Heels, who cried aloud, Stop, &s;top him, he has killed a Man. This Cry made &s;everal Per&s;ons throw them&s;elves in his Way, and endeavour to &s;eize him; but the&s;e Ene|mies were not near &s;o formidable as tho&s;e be|hind, he conceived he might ea&s;ily terrify them by holding his drawn Sword in his Hand; and, in Effect, the Sight of it, and the Chevalier's threatening Looks, &s;o intimi|dated them, that not one would venture to lay hold on him, but, on the contrary, opened him a Pa&s;&s;age, through the Coaches and Chariots, with which the little Bridge is al|ways crouded. He e&s;caped thus from the Croud, and going through By-&s;treets, he ar|rived &s;afe at the Hou&s;e of his Friend, where
<PB N="240" REF="241">
he read Madam <HI>de Berci's</HI> Billet with in|finite Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Chevalier had not acquainted his Friend with his De&s;ign of delivering the Counte&s;s: but he now told it him, together with the Danger he had lately e&s;caped. Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere,</HI> for that was the Name of this faithful Friend of the Chevalier's, blamed him greatly for his Ra&s;hne&s;s, and told him, that he, with le&s;s Danger and equal Succe&s;s, might have tran&s;acted the Bu|&s;ine&s;s with the Butcher and his Wife, and have conveyed the Letter to and from the Lady &s;afe. The Chevalier embraced him tenderly, and thanking him for his Zeal, repre&s;ented to him, that on this Occa&s;ion, if he attempted to &s;erve the Counte&s;s, and was di&s;covered, it might create a Su&s;picion that he lay concealed in his Hou&s;e, and if that happened, he &s;hould either be appre|hended, or obliged to leave <HI>Paris</HI> to avoid it; either of which, in the melancholy Si|tuation the Counte&s;s was in, would be wor&s;e than Death to him, as it would leave him no Po&s;&s;ibility of a&s;&s;i&s;ting her.</P>
<P><Q>But, interrupted Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Rouvere,</HI> in what manner do you propo&s;e to con|vey Letters to her now, for it would be Madne&s;s to pro&s;ecute your former Scheme. If you return again to the Butchers, you will infallibly have all the Bailiffs to con|tend with, and probably the Mob of <HI>Paris</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="242">
likewi&s;e, in which Ca&s;e a Di&s;covery of your Per&s;on would be the certain Con&s;equence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have thought of an admirable Expe|dient, replied the Chevalier after a little Pau&s;e, I will, as &s;oon as it is Night, dre&s;s my&s;elf like a Beggar, and be &s;o well di&s;gui&s;ed, that you &s;hall hardly know me. I will creep along the Street a&s;king Alms, till I get near the Chatelet, where I will attempt two Things, the one is, to &s;end another Line to the Counte&s;s, by the &s;ame Conveyance as before; and the other, to procure, if po&s;&s;ible, an Interview with the Turnkey of the Pri&s;on, and try, if, with the Hopes of a con&s;iderable Reward, I can prevail with him to let the Counte&s;s e&s;cape. Although I &s;hould &s;pend all my E&s;tate, pur|&s;ued the Chevalier with great Emotion, in this De&s;ign, I &s;hall yet be too happy and too rich if I procure her Liberty, for which I would readily &s;acrifice my Life.</Q></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> approved of his Friend's Scheme:
<Q>But, in order to render the Succe&s;s of it le&s;s uncertain, &s;aid he, I think it will be nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould fol|low you at a Di&s;tance, with four or five Servants well armed, to prevent any Acci|dent happening to you, if you &s;hould be known; and I would advi&s;e you, continued he, to take Money with you to give imme|diately to the Turnkey, for you deceive your&s;elf, if you imagine he will li&s;ten to
<PB N="242" REF="243">
your Propo&s;als, unle&s;s he is &s;oftened by the Sight of that per&s;ua&s;ive Metal. And it is po&s;&s;ible, that, without &s;uch a powerful Ad|vocate, he may &s;eize your Per&s;on for tempt|ing him to betray his Tru&s;t. I think in the Letter you write to the Counte&s;s, you &s;hould de&s;ire her to &s;ound this Man; and if &s;he finds him di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve her, to tell him, that one of her Friends de&s;igned to have a Conference with him this Night, concern|ing her Affairs; &s;he may likewi&s;e promi&s;e him a con&s;iderable Sum, which you &s;hall fix in your Letter, and have it ready with you to give him, in ca&s;e he complies. The Counte&s;s will certainly have a better Op|portunity to enter upon this Negotiation, than you can have, and when &s;he has once begun, you may conclude it happily together.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier approved of his Friend's Advice, and waited with an ardent Impa|tience for the Hour in which he was to put his Project in Execution. After a &s;hort Din|ner, he wrote to the Counte&s;s, depending upon conveying it to her in the &s;ame manner as he had done in the Morning: he then put on &s;ome ragged Cloaths, torne Stockings, and an old Pair of Shoes, one of which wanted a Heel, and helped to give him a hobbling Gate; his Hair was all tied up under the mi&s;erable Remains of a Wig that had once been fair, but now looked like a darki&s;h red; a large black Patch covered
<PB N="243" REF="244">
half one Side of his Face; and, upon the whole, he was &s;o well di&s;gui&s;ed, that had he been met by his mo&s;t intimate Friends, he would not have been known.</P>
<P>In this Equipage he &s;et out in the Evening, followed at a di&s;tance by his Friend, and two &s;tout Footmen. The Chevalier was not with|out Apprehen&s;ions of meeting with &s;ome un|lucky Accident, like that in the Morning, and was grieved that he had not been able to take his Sword along with him; for he was armed only with a little Poignard, which he concealed in his Brea&s;t. When he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the Chatelet, he left the Barriere where the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|liffs &s;it, and on his left Hand, entered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Street of the Butcher's, leaving his Friend and his Servants to walk lei&s;urely between the little Bridge and the Entrance to the Street <HI>St. Jac|ques.</HI> He went immediately to his friendly But|cher, whom he found in great Concern about him; they did not know him again till he &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke to them, and overjoyed that he had &s;o happily e&s;caped from the Bailiffs and the Mob that had pur&s;ued him in the Morning, they con|ducted him in&s;tantly to the Chamber, from whence he had thrown his former Letter in|to the Grate, as he did this likewi&s;e, with equal Succe&s;s. He de&s;ired the Counte&s;s in it to prepare the Turnkey for an Interview with him at Nine o'Clock that Night, and to let him know that he &s;hould receive five hun|dred Crowns in Hand, and a thou&s;and
<PB N="244" REF="245">
more as &s;oon as he had delivered up his Pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, who&s;e Thoughts had been bu&s;ied in contriving Means to facilitate her E&s;cape, ever &s;ince &s;he had received the Che|valier's fir&s;t Letter, had actually hit on the &s;ame Expedient, and had &s;ounded the Turn|key that very Day: he had li&s;tened to her with great Attention and Complacency, but had promi&s;ed nothing in particular, he only ex|pre&s;&s;ed great Compa&s;&s;ion for her Misfortunes, and an Inclination to do her all the Service that was in his Power. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was overjoyed to &s;ee a &s;econd Billet from the Chevalier fall into her Chamber; &s;he was &s;till more plea&s;ed with the Contents of it, and thought it a favourable Circum&s;tance that the Chevalier and her&s;elf had made Choice of the &s;ame Scheme to effect her Liberty. She wrote an An&s;wer immediately, in which &s;he told the Chevalier, that &s;he would give the Turnkey a Pre&s;ent when he came with her Supper, as u&s;ual, and make him the Offers mentioned in his Letter. She de&s;ired him not to come to the Chatelet till Ten o'clock at Night, at which Hour &s;he hoped to prevail upon the Turnkey to meet him. The Chevalier went down into the Street, that he might be ready to take up the Counte&s;s's Billet as &s;oon as he &s;aw it fall: he had the good Fortune to &s;ecure it in his Pocket without being perceived. But he fell into another Scrape, which was much
<PB N="245" REF="246">
more dangerous than the Adventure that hap|pened to him in the Morning.</P>
<P>It was formerly a Cu&s;tom in <HI>Paris,</HI> on <HI>Chri&s;tmas Eve,</HI> for a Commi&s;&s;ary, attended with a certain Number of Archers, to walk through the Streets, and take up all the Poor they met, who, during that &s;olemn Fe&s;tival, were carried by Force, if they would not go voluntarily, to a Place prepared for their Re|ception, where they were cloathed and &s;up|ported with the Money that was found in the Poor's Boxes in Churches, and with the Alms given by charitable Per&s;ons. The Chevalier, as he was returning to meet his Friends, was met by the Commi&s;&s;ary and his Guard: the Archers concluding the Chevalier was a Beg|gar, invited him to follow them, he refu&s;ed, and two or three of the Archers laid hold on him, in order to force him along with them, wondering at the Folly of the mi&s;erable Wretch, who refu&s;ed to go to a Place where he would be cloathed and fed for a certain Number of Days; the Chevalier finding they were re&s;olved to compel him to accept of this Charity, re&s;i&s;ted them with &s;o much Strength and Ob&s;tinacy, that they grew weary of con|tending with him, and left him at Liberty to go where he plea&s;ed. His Friend, who at a Di&s;tance &s;aw what pa&s;&s;ed, advanced with his two Servants, under Pretence of a&s;king what was the Matter, and favoured the Chevalier's Retreat. In Effect, he happily e&s;caped this Danger, and arrived &s;afe at his Friend's Hou&s;e,
<PB N="246" REF="247">
where he was &s;oon followed by Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Ronvere,</HI> and they read Madam <HI>de Berci's</HI> Billet with great Joy. They entertained them|&s;elves at Supper with the plea&s;ing Hopes of &s;oon freeing that per&s;ecuted innocent Lady from her Confinement: and as &s;oon as they had &s;upped, they went to pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the Chatelet, at the appointed Hour. They were attended by &s;everal Servants well armed, &s;o that if the Turnkey &s;hould prove perfidious, they were in a Condition to take Revenge on him, and to defend them&s;elves again&s;t any that &s;hould offer to &s;eize them.</P>
<P>In the mean time Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> took an Opportunity to &s;peak to the Turnkey, when he brought her Supper into her Chamber. She had about four hundred Crowns in her Pur&s;e, which &s;he divided between the Turnkey and the Woman that attended her: &s;he told them, that &s;he made them that Pre&s;ent in return for their obliging Behaviour to her, ever &s;ince &s;he had been a Pri&s;oner; and that, if God was plea&s;ed to make her Innocence manife&s;t, and &s;he was re&s;tored to her Liberty, &s;he would give them further Proofs of her Gratitude. She mentioned the approaching Trial &s;he was to undergo, and bur&s;ting into Tears, a&s;&s;ured them that no Tortures &s;hould extort from her the Confe&s;&s;ion of a Crime &s;he had never com|mitted, and if &s;he died under them, &s;he hoped Ju&s;tice would be done to her Memory.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="248">The Woman wept bitterly at this Di&s;|cour&s;e; the Turnkey was greatly affected. A Lady &s;o young, &s;o lovely, of &s;uch high Birth, and in all Appearance &s;o innocent, to be put to the Torture, was a Thought he could not endure:
<Q>how meritorious would it be, whi&s;pered he to the Woman, if we could pre&s;erve this Lady from the cruel Fate with which &s;he is threatened!</Q>
The Wo|man, although &s;he dur&s;t not be the fir&s;t to make &s;uch a Propo&s;al, was overjoyed that he had mentioned it; &s;he eagerly a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he would run any Hazard to &s;ave her. The Counte&s;s ob&s;erved their Whi&s;pers, her Heart divided between Fear and Hope, beat with unu&s;ual Violence. At length they ap|proached her, &s;he waited trembling for the Re&s;ult of their Conference, judging that her De&s;tiny depended upon the Re&s;olution they had taken. The Turnkey, addre&s;&s;ing her with Tears in his Eyes, urged her to make her E&s;cape; and both he and the Woman a&s;&s;ured her that they would venture their Lives to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. He told her, that it &s;hould be his Part to deliver her out of Pri&s;on, provided &s;he had any Per&s;on in whom &s;he could con|&s;ide that would receive her from him at the Gate of the Chatelet, and conduct her out of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Counte&s;s was tran&s;ported to &s;ee them enter &s;o readily into her Mea&s;ures: &s;uch unhoped-for good Fortune made her doubtful whether &s;he was not in a Dream; but recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he heedfully ob|&s;erved the Countenances of her two Friends,
<PB N="248" REF="249">
and &s;aw &s;o many Marks of real Sorrow and Tenderne&s;s imprinted on them, that &s;he was per&s;uaded they were &s;incere in their Profe&s;|&s;ions. She then opened her&s;elf more freely to them, and a&s;&s;ured them that they &s;hould have no Rea&s;on to repent of what they did for her Service; that they might hope every thing from her Genero&s;ity and Gratitude, and that they &s;hould be largely recompen&s;ed for the Advantages they quitted in the Chatelet to &s;et her at Liberty; that if he was in Ear|ne&s;t in his Offers, &s;he had a Friend who would that very Night give him five hun|dred Crowns, and when he delivered her in to his Hands, a thou&s;and more; &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that he might depend upon this Pro|mi&s;e, but that he mu&s;t be al&s;o exact in the Performance of his; for that if he &s;hould fail, no Place on Earth would be able to &s;helter him from the Vengeance of her Friend. She added, that he might make his Fortune in one Day if he plea&s;ed, and he enabled to quit a Profe&s;&s;ion, which could not but be very di&s;agreeable to one who had any Humanity or Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The Turnkey unalterably fixed in his Re|&s;olution of delivering her by &s;uch great Of|fers, a&s;&s;ured her with the mo&s;t &s;acred Oaths, that he would perform his Promi&s;e in the Counte&s;s then &s;hewed him the Letter &s;he had received from the Chevaller, and it was re&s;olved that the Turnkey &s;hould give him a Meeting that Night, in order to receive the
<PB N="249" REF="250">
five hundred Crowns, and to &s;ix the Day for her E&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Turnkey did not fail to go out of the Chatelet at the appointed Hour, and &s;eeing two Men at a little Di&s;tance from the Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he concluded they mu&s;t be the Lady's Friends, who were waiting for him. One of them, who was the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> advanced immediately; and a&s;ked him, if it was he that carried Provi&s;ions into the Chamber of a Lady who was Pri&s;oner in the Chatelet? The Turnkey replied, he was, and that the Lady had &s;ent him to confer with him concerning the Means to &s;et her at Liberty. The Che|valier was overjoyed at the&s;e Words: he found by them that Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> had been &s;ucce&s;sful, and taking out of his Pocket a Pur&s;e in which were five hundred Crowns in Gold,
<Q>Friend, &s;aid he to the Turnkey, putting it into his Hand, receive this &s;mall Earne&s;t of my Gratitude, and depend upon being rewarded with a Sum much larger, provided you will To-morrow deliver your Pri&s;oner into my Hands. But do not de|ceive me, added he, for if you do, I will take away your Life, though I &s;acrifice my own.</Q>
<Q>I will not deceive you, replied the Turnkey, receiving the Pur&s;e, but I cannot promi&s;e you to free the Lady before <HI>Saint John's</HI> Day: my Ma&s;ter always keeps that Fe&s;tival, and makes a great En|tertainment in the Chatelet, to which all his Friends and Relations are invited; they
<PB N="250" REF="251">
will not fail to drink deep, and I hope I &s;hall find &s;ome Opportunity that Evening to acquit my&s;elf of the Promi&s;e I have made you to deliver the Lady; that Pro|mi&s;e I here repeat to you, Mon&s;ieur, and engage at the Hazard of my Life to bring the Lady at Twelve o'Clock that Night to the New-market, where you mu&s;t be ready to receive her, but till then you mu&s;t have Patience; and do not attempt to convey any more Letters to her, for fear any thing &s;hould happen that may di&s;cover the Corre&s;pondence we hold together. Again, Mon&s;ieur, I beg you to rely upon my Sincerity, and doubt not but I will faithfully perform my Promi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The Turnkey then urged him to depart, le&s;t they &s;hould by &s;ome prying Eye be ob|&s;erved in Di&s;cour&s;e together. The Chevalier repeating his Promi&s;e of a further Reward, and recommending Caution and Zeal in the Lady's Service, rejoined his Friend, to whom he related all that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and the Turnkey. This fortunate Beginning &s;eemed &s;uch an Earne&s;t of happy Succe&s;s, that the Chevalier re&s;igned him&s;elf up to a Joy he had long been unacquainted with. He would not Delay a Moment relieving the Anxiety of the &s;orrowing Parents: before he went to his Friend's Hotel, he called upon the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and gave him Hopes that he &s;hould behold his Daughter at Liberty. The Chevalier did not think it
<PB N="251" REF="252">
proper to toll them what Mea&s;ures he was pur&s;uing to bring about this happy Event; but tho&s;e few Words tran&s;ported them with Joy. They endeavoured to intere&s;t all Heaven in his Favour, by the mo&s;t ardent Supplica|tions, and he retired loaded with their Ble&s;|&s;ings and Prai&s;es.</P>
<P>The next Day, the Turnkey informed Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> of his having &s;ettled every thing with her Friend, and that on the Fe&s;ti|val of <HI>Saint John</HI> he hoped to be able to deliver her into his Hands. How &s;weet were the Hopes of Liberty to that unhappy Lady, who had &s;o long langui&s;hed amid&s;t the Hor|rors of a Pri&s;on. She now for the fir&s;t time &s;ince her Entrance into that fatal Place, felt &s;ome Remi&s;&s;ion of her Grief. Her Mind admitted a Hope of once more being happy. She dwelt with Plea&s;ure on the Remembrance of all the Services &s;he had received from the Chevalier, and having no longer tyrannic Duty to combat with, indulged a Tenderne&s;s authorized by her Hu&s;band's dying Command, and his own exalted Merit. In &s;uch agreeable Reflexions, &s;he le&s;&s;ened that Interval of Time which otherwi&s;e would have appeared &s;o te|dious. Yet &s;he was often alarmed with Fears that their Enterprize would be di&s;covered, and that Anxiety, &s;o natural to Per&s;ons in Su&s;pence, &s;ometimes damped her Joy for the near Pro&s;pect of her Liberty, and gave her up to Terror and De&s;pondence.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253">At length, the Day &s;o impatiently wi&s;hed-for appeared. The Jailor celebrated the Fe&s;ti|val with a great Entertainment as u&s;ual. They prolonged the Debauch to a later Hour than ever they had done before, which was a very unfavourable Circum&s;tance. The Turn|key had given Notice to the Counte&s;s and the Chevalier to hold them&s;elves in Readine&s;s at Eleven o'Clock, the one in her Chamber, the other at the New-market. They both were per&s;uaded, that if they lo&s;t this Opportunity, it would be very difficult to find another; and that it would not be po&s;&s;ible to procure a further Delay of the Sentence again&s;t the Counte&s;s. The Chevalier po&s;ted him&s;elf with his Friend, and four other Gentlemen well armed, at the appointed Place. With &s;uch an E&s;cort they had nothing to fear from the Archers, if they &s;hould be betrayed; and they were determined, if they once got the Coun|te&s;s out of the Chatelet, to kill all that op|po&s;ed them, rather than &s;uffer her to be taken from them. When the Clock &s;truck Eleven, an univer&s;al Trembling &s;eized the poor Coun|te&s;s, her Heart beat, as if it would leave her Brea&s;t, anxiou&s;ly &s;he li&s;tened to every little Noi&s;e, and longed, with eager Impatience, to hear the &s;oftly treading Foot of her Deliverer nor was the Chevalier under le&s;s Agitations, when he heard the important Hour &s;trike; Fear and Hope, for &s;ome Moments, equally divided his Soul; but when he found the Turnkey did not appear, he was almo&s;t di&s;|tracted, he thought his beloved Counte&s;s
<PB N="253" REF="254">
wholly lo&s;t, and in the Agony of his Grief and De&s;pair, he was for going forward to the Chatelet, and making &s;ome de&s;perate Attempt to relieve her.</P>
<P>The Turnkey at length appeared, but with|out the Counte&s;s: the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> tran&s;ported with Rage, was for &s;acrificing him in&s;tantly to his Revenge, &s;uppo&s;ing he had betrayed him. The Turnkey &s;eeing the Che|valier advance in a threatening Po&s;ture, beg|ged him to li&s;ten patiently to him for one Moment: he then a&s;&s;ured him, that nothing had hindered him from performing his Pro|mi&s;e, but the unexpected Stay of the Gue&s;ts to a later Hour than u&s;ual; that they were now all gone, and that his Ma&s;ter was pre|paring to go to Bed, where he did not doubt but he would be &s;oon fa&s;t a&s;leep; for he had drank deep, and was greatly intoxicated. He intreated him to wait patiently a little Time longer, when he would infallibly bring out the Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;urance calmed the Rage of the Chevalier, and di&s;&s;ipated his Unea&s;ine&s;s; but the poor Counte&s;s was in dreadful Agonies. She had counted the Hour by &s;everal dif|ferent Clocks, which &s;he heard, &s;trike, but not &s;eeing her Deliverer, &s;he flattered her|&s;elf that her Impatience had made her mi&s;|take. The Turnkey, terrified by the former Menaces of the Chevalier, was only &s;oli|citous about &s;atisfying him, without giving
<PB N="254" REF="255">
him&s;elf any Trouble to calm the Fears of the Counte&s;s. As the Minutes rolled away, her Apprehen&s;ions increa&s;ed; yet &s;till &s;he fain would have per&s;uaded her&s;elf, that &s;he had mi&s;counted the Hour, and this Thought left her &s;ome faint Remains of Hope which &s;upported her fluttering Spirits, till the Clock &s;truck, and &s;he reckoned Twelve. At this &s;ad Confirmation of her Fears, a mortal Pale|ne&s;s over&s;pread her Face; her trembling Knees could no longer &s;upport her Weight, &s;he &s;unk down upon a Chair, and lo&s;ing all Hopes of Liberty and of Life, &s;he abandoned her&s;elf-to an Exce&s;s of De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e Agonies, more cruel than the Tortures &s;he dreaded, the Turnkey &s;ud|denly opened the Door of her Chamber, and de&s;ired her to follow him: his unexpected Sight had &s;uch an Effect upon the Counte&s;s, that &s;he fell fainting into the Arms of the Woman who attended her; her Mind tor|tured at fir&s;t by Su&s;pen&s;e, and afterwards &s;unk in the mo&s;t deep De&s;pair, could not bear the overwhelming Joy which the &s;ud|den Tran&s;ition from certain Death, to Li|berty and Safety gave her. She continued a long Time deprived of Speech and Sen&s;e, and in all Appearance dead.</P>
<P>The Turnkey, &s;urprized at this Accident, and dreading the fatal Con&s;equences of it, knew not what to do. The Woman, who was likewi&s;e a Witne&s;s of &s;o &s;ad a Spectacle,
<PB N="255" REF="256">
was &s;o much terrified, that &s;he was for &s;eve|ral Moments incapable of giving her any A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But after they had thrown &s;ome Water on her Face, &s;he gave Signs of return|ing Life; the Turnkey repeatedly cried to her that her Friends were waiting for her. That welcome Sound, at length, recalled her &s;cattered Spirits, &s;he opened her Eyes, and the Turnkey urging her to depart im|mediately, le&s;t they &s;hould be prevented, Fear gave her Strength in an In&s;tant; the Woman lent her her &s;upporting Arm, while the Turnkey &s;oftly walked before with a Light; with eager, though trembling Stept, &s;he quitted that horrible Place. When &s;he had got without the Gate, &s;he thought her|&s;elf &s;ecure, and now light as the Wind, her willing Feet carried her along; &s;he hardly touched the Ground, and flew rather than walked to the Place where the Chevalier and his Friends were waiting for her with great Anxiety. The Chevalier received her with a thou&s;and Tran&s;ports of Joy: his Friend congratulated her on her recovered Liberty, in Terms that &s;hewed the highe&s;t Satisfaction; they put her and the Woman who had attended her in the Pri&s;on, and who never after quitted her, into a Coach they had brought-with them, and giving the Turn|key the promi&s;ed Reward, they left him to provide for his own Safety, and went after the Coach, together with the four Gentle|men who had followed them in this dan|gerous Enterpri&s;e. The Coach brought the
<PB N="256" REF="257">
Counte&s;s &s;afe to the Hou&s;e of the Chevalier's Friend, where he had lain &s;o long concealed, and where Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> with their Ladies, were expecting her and her ge|nerous Re&s;cuers, with Agitations that can bet|ter be imagined than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s eagerly entered the Room where her Relations were: her Sight drew a joyful Exclamation from her Brother and Si&s;ter-in-law, who &s;prung to meet her; her Eyes with &s;peaking Tenderne&s;s returned their raptured Welcomes; but her Feet &s;ponta|neous carried her to her Mother's Chair, who&s;e &s;trong Emotions had rendered unable either to ri&s;e or &s;peak; Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> threw her&s;elf on her Knees before her, and taking a Hand of each dear Parent, as they &s;at clo&s;e together, &s;he put them to her Lips in a pa|thetic Silence, for her Heart was too full to &s;peak. The overjoyed Mother hung over her with Tears of Tenderne&s;s and Tran&s;port; the no le&s;s tran&s;ported Father embraced her as &s;he kneeled, and with lifted Eyes adored the gra|cious Providence that had re&s;tored to him his Child. The young Marquis and his Lady, impatient to fold their beloved Si&s;ter in their Arms, &s;tood clo&s;e be&s;ide her, each with Arms extended for the wi&s;hed Embrace; while the Chevalier and his Friend, extremely affected with this tender Scene, &s;tood at &s;ome Di&s;tance contemplating it.

lamented, re&s;tored by him to Liberty, to Life, and to the tender Gratulations of her Friends. No Wonder, that his Heart entertained a Hope of being one Day rewarded with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her whom he had &s;o faithfully &s;erved.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports for this happy Meeting were a little abated, and their Joy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound vent in Words: a thou&s;and rapturous Welcomes were given the Counte&s;s, a thou|&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings pronounced on the Chevalier, who had &s;o generou&s;ly expo&s;ed his Life, to deliver her; nor was Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere's</HI> Kindne&s;s unacknowledged by the whole late &s;orrowing, now rejoicing Family. The Morn|ing appeared e'er they could be per&s;uaded to &s;eparate; but the Chevalier repre&s;enting to them that it might rai&s;e &s;ome Su&s;picions if they were not &s;een, as u&s;ual, at their own Hotel, the two Marqui&s;&s;es and their Ladies, with extreme Reluctance, returned Home, and left the Counte&s;s to recruit her wa&s;ted Spirits, in Slumbers more tranquil than any &s;he had for a long Time ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s's E&s;cape from the Chatelet was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;oon di&s;covered, as they had Rea&s;on to apprehend; for the Jailor, from the Effects of the Night's Debauch, lay late in Bed, and when he got up, was &s;o much di&s;ordered, that for &s;everal Hours he could not, as u&s;ual, vi&s;it his Pri&s;oners, to &s;ee if all were &s;afe. At length, however, he took his
<PB N="258" REF="259">
accu&s;tomed Rounds: when he came to the Chamber where the Counte&s;s had been con|fined, and found the Door open, and no one within, he grew pale with Fear and Amaze|ment, and dreaded to make any Enquiries, le&s;t his Apprehen&s;ions &s;hould be turned into Certainties. His Wife having ju&s;t then been informed, that the Turnkey had not been &s;een in the Chatelet that Day, came to ac|quaint her Hu&s;band with the News, and was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee him gazing wildly round the Lady's Chamber, with all the Marks of Terror and Di&s;may imprinted on his Coun|tenance.</P>
<P><Q>Do you know, cried &s;he, pulling him by the Sleeve, that the Turnkey is fled?</Q>
The Jailor, at the&s;e Words, &s;tarting as from a Dream, &s;ent forth a Volly of Execrations, and tearing his Hair, roared out that he was ruined, the Lady had made her e&s;cape, and the wicked Turnkey, it was plain, had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and was fled with her. The Wife taking in in&s;tantly all the fatal Con&s;equences of this Flight, intreated her Hu&s;band to compo&s;e him&s;elf, and to endeavour privately to di&s;cover what Way the Fugitives had taken, and get them again into his Hands.
<Q>It will be Time enough, &s;aid &s;he, to declare their Flight, when you have lo&s;t all Hopes of recovering them. You will unavoidably be turned out of your Employment, as &s;oon as it is known that this Accident happened through your Intemperance, therefore, by keeping it
<PB N="259" REF="260">
&s;ecret, you will only defer your Fate a little longer, if you do not &s;ucceed in your Attempts to get back your Pri&s;oner, and if you do, you will have nothing to fear.</Q></P>
<P>The Jailor reli&s;hed this Rea&s;oning, al|though it was very ab&s;urd; for he ought im|mediately to have given Notice to the Of|ficers of Ju&s;tice, that the Counte&s;s had e&s;caped, that &s;he might have been immediate|ly pur&s;ued; his Wife, however, was willing to put off the evil Moment as long as &s;he could. This Procra&s;tination &s;aved the Coun|te&s;s, as it gave her Friends Time to &s;ettle the Method of her Flight.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;ieurs and the Ladies <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur</HI> returned to the Hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> the next Day, as &s;ecretly as po&s;&s;ible, in order to con&s;ult with the Counte&s;s and her Friends upon the Mea&s;ures they were to take to keep her concealed. They did not doubt but her Flight from the Chatelet was already publicly known, and that &s;he would be &s;ought for with the utmo&s;t Diligence. This Thought gave them great Unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;uch is the Vici&s;&s;itude of human Pa&s;&s;ions, and of Affairs below: Hope and Fear, Joy and Sorrow, &s;ucceed each other naturally, as Darkne&s;s to the Light.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;port which the Relations of the Counte&s;s had felt for her Deliverance, now gave way to their Sorrow for her Departure,
<PB N="260" REF="261">
which for many obvious Rea&s;ons, it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be &s;udden. While they were deliberating in great Confu&s;ion and Anxiety upon the Mea&s;ures &s;he &s;hould pur|&s;ue. Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere,</HI> who had very prudently been in Search of News that Morn|ing, &s;uppo&s;ing the Town would be full of the Counte&s;s's E&s;cape, returned plea&s;ingly &s;ur|prized, to tell the perplexed Family, that Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was either not yet mi&s;&s;ed, or the Jailor, for Con&s;iderations in which him|&s;elf was concerned, had certainly concealed her Flight, that therefore they need not pre|cipitate their Re&s;olutions, but take Time to deliberate upon the Cour&s;e which was now mo&s;t proper to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s propo&s;ed retiring to <HI>Burgun|dy,</HI> where &s;he might remain in Safety, in a Ca&s;tle belonging to the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur,</HI> her Father; the natural Strength of the Place, and the great Affection all the Gentle|men in that Province bore her Family, made that appear to her the &s;ecure&s;t as well as the mo&s;t decent Retreat, as it was not likely they would &s;uffer any Violence to be offered to her there. The old Marquis was of Opinion, that to attempt to &s;ecure his Daughter by Force, was an In&s;ult to the Authority of Ju&s;tice, and the highe&s;t Di&s;re&s;pect to the So|vereign, who would undoubtedly, if thus braved by his Subjects, make him&s;elf be obeyed in his own Kingdom, in &s;pite of all Ob&s;tacles. It was then propo&s;ed by the young
<PB N="261" REF="262">
Marquis, that his Si&s;ter &s;hould leave <HI>France,</HI> and till this Storm that threatened her Life and Honour, was laid, re&s;ide in &s;ome foreign Country. <HI>Flanders</HI> was unanimou&s;ly allowed to be the fitte&s;t Retreat for her, the City of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> in particular, where &s;he had a Kin&s;|woman, with whom &s;he could &s;tay with Ho|nour. This Lady was Wife to the Amba&s;&s;a|dor from <HI>France</HI> to the Archduke, and had always had a great Friend&s;hip for Madam <HI>de Berci.</HI> It was therefore concluded, that &s;he &s;hould &s;et out early the next Morning, with an E&s;cort able to defend her again&s;t any At|tempts that might be made upon her Liberty. Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> engaged the four Gentle|men, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in carrying the Coun|te&s;s from the Chatelet, to accompany him in guarding her to the Frontiers: they were likewi&s;e to be attended by a good Number of their Servants, well armed; and they de|clared, that they would not quit the Lady, till they delivered her &s;afe to the Amba&s;&s;a|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, with eager Joy, &s;eized this new Opportunity of &s;hewing his Zeal and Ardor in the Service of his beloved Coun|te&s;s: no Intreaties could di&s;&s;uade him from attending her in this Journey; and he re|&s;olved not to quit her any more till her In|nocence was made manife&s;t in the Eyes of all <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">When it was fully determined, that the Counte&s;s &s;hould retire to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and all the nece&s;&s;ary Preparations for her Journey were made, they next con&s;ulted upon the Mea&s;ures to be taken in order to di&s;cover the Author of the Count's A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, by which alone &s;he could be cleared, as well as the Chevalier, upon whom the Weight of this Accu&s;ation fell. The Count's Hint relating to <HI>Marianne,</HI> the con&s;cious Look he gave her, her extreme Confu&s;ion in Con&s;equence of it, and her diabolical Malice in accu&s;ing the Counte&s;s, were the Points now di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> li&s;tened attentively to the different Opinions that were formed upon this Wretch's Behaviour: &s;ome Su&s;picions &s;uddenly darted into her Mind; <HI>Marianne's</HI> &s;candalous Intrigue with <HI>Verague</HI> ru&s;hed up|on her Remembrance; &s;he thought &s;he ought not to conceal a Circum&s;tance of &s;uch Im|portance from her Family, however unwilling &s;he was to di&s;cover the infamous Secret, and which her Delicacy con&s;idered as a kind of Recrimination. Her Friends greatly blamed her for &s;o long &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a Circum&s;tance of &s;uch a Nature, and, with good Rea&s;on, form|ed violent Su&s;picions again&s;t <HI>Verague.</HI> The young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> was commi&s;|&s;ioned immediately to make &s;ome Inquiries after that Gentleman: he went to his Hou&s;e, and was told that he was not at home; the Marquis a&s;ked &s;o many Que&s;tions concern|ing him, and &s;o artfully examined the Ser|vant who an&s;wered him, that at la&s;t he
<PB N="263" REF="264">
learned that <HI>Verague</HI> had left <HI>Paris</HI> fifteen Days before, and was gone to pa&s;s &s;ome time in travelling. When he returned to his Friends with this Account, no one doubted but that <HI>Verague</HI> was the real A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. But as they could, as yet, prove nothing, it was judged proper to keep their Su&s;picions &s;ecret from all but Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> who was as well as them, greatly intere&s;ted in revenging his Bro|ther's Murder. As he truly e&s;teemed and loved his Si&s;ter-in-law, he was rejoiced to hear of her E&s;cape from Pri&s;on; and re&s;olved, together with the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> to go in Search of the Murderer, and, if po&s;&s;ible, bring him to Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>At length the cruel Moment came that was to &s;eparate the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> from her afflicted Friends: they had no Lei&s;ure to in|dulge Tears and Embraces; &s;udden and &s;ad their Parting was. The old Marquis, his Lady, and Daughter-in-law, not being al|lowed to follow her to the Coach, for fear of giving Su&s;picion, pre&s;&s;ed her each in their Arms, and withdrew, in &s;ilent Angui&s;h, at Eight o'Clock at Night. She entered, drown|ed in Tears, a Coach drawn by &s;ix Hor&s;es, which waited for her at a private Gate of Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere's</HI> Hou&s;e. All her female Attendants were the Woman who had fled with her from the Chatelet, and a young Maid that belonged to the Marchione&s;s, her Mother. The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> attended
<PB N="264" REF="265">
by his Gentleman, a Valet de Chambre, and a <HI>Bi&s;cayan,</HI> of who&s;e Fidelity he was well a&s;|&s;ured, mounted their Hor&s;es, as did likewi&s;e Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere,</HI> and the four Gentle|men before mentioned, and followed the Coach at a &s;mall Di&s;tance; they went all out of <HI>Paris</HI> by the Gate of <HI>St. Denis,</HI> and took the Rout through <HI>Picardy</HI> to <HI>Flanders.</HI> They &s;oon reached <HI>Cambray,</HI> having travelled with great Speed, and re&s;ting there one Day, pur&s;ued their Journey, but with le&s;s Ha&s;te and Fatigue, as they were now out of Dan|ger. The Chevalier finding there was no|thing farther to apprehend, intreated Mon|&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> and his Friends to return to <HI>Paris</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence, le&s;t if their Ab&s;ence &s;hould be known, they might pro|bably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been of their Par|ty. He as well as the Counte&s;s expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Acknowledgments for the Services they had received from him and his gene|rous Friends. It was with Difficulty that the Chevalier could prevail upon them to re|turn, till they had &s;een the Counte&s;s &s;afe at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>; but the Rea&s;ons he urged for their Departure being unan&s;werable, they at length &s;eparated, not without &s;ome Tears, and ma|ny affectionate Wi&s;hes on both Sides.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cambray</HI> to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> the Chevalier gave his Hor&s;e to his Valet to lead, and &s;eat|ed him&s;elf by the Counte&s;s in the Coach. The continual View of an Object, whom he &s;o ardently loved, &s;oon bani&s;hed all Re|membrance
<PB N="265" REF="266">
of his pa&s;t Misfortunes, and left him no lei&s;ure to reflect on any of tho&s;e with which he was &s;till threatned. A thou&s;and &s;oft Emotions filled his Brea&s;t, but his Re&s;pect for the Counte&s;s whom he &s;aw buried in a pro|found Sadne&s;s, and the Regard he owed to the Memory of his late Friend, repre&s;t the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and obliged him to &s;uch a re&s;erved and di&s;tant Behaviour, as left the Counte&s;s no cau&s;e to complain of him; and indeed during the whole Journey, his tender A&s;&s;iduity, and his &s;olicitude and Ea|gerne&s;s to &s;erve her, were the only indica|tions he gave of a Flame, the mo&s;t pure and con&s;tant that ever warmed a Heart. The Counte&s;s was too generous not to give this Moderation, all the Weight it ought to have, her Gratitude &s;o much engaged already, every Hour added to the Debt, the tender Awe, &s;o apparent in the Chevalier's Behaviour, the con&s;cious Love that &s;parkled in his Eyes, yet when they met hers reluctently withdrawn, le&s;t they &s;hould too plainly di&s;cover all that pa&s;&s;ed in his Heart, were &s;uch Indications of uncommon Delicacy and Re&s;pect, as could not fail of making a very great Impre&s;&s;ion on a Heart &s;o generous as hers. With &s;uch a mutual Re&s;erve did the&s;e two Lovers pa&s;s the happie&s;t Moments of their Lives, the only Opportunities they ever had to declare their Sentiments to each other, were Sacrificed to Delicacy and to Grief.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">As &s;oon as they arrived at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger with a Letter to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady, acquainting her with the Situation of her Affairs, and the De|&s;ign &s;he had of throwing her&s;elf into her Pro|tection: that Lady no &s;ooner received it than &s;he ordered her Coach to be made ready, and went her&s;elf to fetch her Kin&s;woman from the Inn &s;he had put up at; &s;uch an In&s;tance of Re&s;pect joined to the affectionate Reception &s;he gave the Counte&s;s, made the Chevalier en|tertain a high Opinion of the Merit of that Lady. Few Per&s;ons know how to confer Favours on the Unfortunate, the highe&s;t De|licacy mu&s;t accompany Acts of Benevolence to true Merit and Dignity in Affliction, if we would not oppre&s;s that Heart, we intend to relieve, The Chevalier went that Day to pay his Re&s;pects to the Arch-Duke, that Prince received him in the mo&s;t gracious Manner imaginable, the great Actions he had performed in <HI>France,</HI> and even in <HI>Holland,</HI> tho' again&s;t him&s;elf, in&s;pired him with Ad|miration and E&s;teem for &s;uch extraordinary Valour. He loaded him with Favours, in Hopes to bring him over to his Service, and offered him a very con&s;iderable Pen&s;ion to engage him to fix him&s;elf in his Court, but the Chevalier had too much Greatne&s;s of Mind to &s;ecure his Safety by Conce&s;&s;ions in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t Honour. He in|treated his Highne&s;s not to be offended with him for refu&s;ing the Offers he was plea&s;ed to make him, he a&s;&s;ured him that although he
<PB N="267" REF="268">
had incurred the Di&s;plea&s;ure of his King, rather indeed by his Misfortune than his Fault, yet that he was re&s;olved to continue faithful to him till his Death; but at the &s;ame Time he expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Acknowledge|ments to the Arch-Duke, for his offered Bounty, and declared that he would be always ready to &s;hed his Blood in Support of his Intere&s;ts, uninfluenced by any Reward, when he could do &s;o without violating the Duty he owed his lawful Sovereign.</P>
<P>The Arch-Duke was generous enough to applaud a Conduct which oppo&s;ed his De&s;ires, he was charmed with his di&s;intere&s;ted Loyalty, and gave him publick Te&s;timonies of his E&s;teem. As the Chevalier conceived he had only performed his Duty by rejecting the Arch-Duke's Offers, he did not repent of what he had done, although he found him&s;elf &s;till per&s;ecuted by his Prince, for <HI>Henry</HI> was no &s;ooner informed that the Counte&s;s and he had retired to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>; but he &s;ent Orders to his Amba&s;&s;ador there to arre&s;t them both and &s;end them under a &s;trong Guard to <HI>Paris.</HI> The Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady greatly concerned that &s;he could no longer protect her unfor|tunate Kin&s;woman, acquainted her immedia|tiately with the Orders her Hu&s;band had re|ceived. It was re&s;olved &s;he &s;hould leave <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> with as much Expediton and Se|cre&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, and retire to <HI>Frie&s;land.</HI> The Chevalier in&s;en&s;ible to his own Mi&s;|fortunes, only lamented tho&s;e of the Count&s;es.

She again &s;et out under his Convoy, and they arrived &s;afely in <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> where they hoped to remain for &s;ome Time in Tranquility, but Fortune was not yet weary of per&s;ecuting the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> her Charms had not &s;uffered any Dimunition from the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;he had been in, her Countenance &s;hewed indeed that her Mind was not at ea&s;e, but that &s;oft Lan|guor, with which it was over&s;pread, carried a &s;ecret Influence that no Heart could re&s;i&s;t. No one could behold her without feeling pity for her Sorrows whatever they were, and Pity for &s;o lovely an Object, &s;oon ripened into a more tender Pa&s;&s;ion: it was thus that a No|bleman of <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> found him&s;elf captivated with the melancholly Fair One, before he was aware, but pre&s;uming upon his Rank and Fortune, he was at no Pains to de&s;gui&s;e his Pa&s;&s;ion, the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> had per|ceived it before he him&s;elf could give a Name to his Sentiments. Nothing is &s;o quick &s;ighted as the Eyes of a Lover, all his Con|fidence in the Ju&s;tice and Genero&s;ity of Ma|dam <HI>de Berci</HI> could not hinder him from feel|ing the mo&s;t cruel Torments at the Thoughts of this new Conque&s;t, but dreading to offend her, by a Jealou&s;y &s;o injurious to that perfect E&s;teem &s;he expre&s;t for him, he impo&s;ed Si|lence upon his Tongue, and had it been po&s;&s;ible would have regulated his Looks in &s;uch a Manner, that they &s;hould not have given the lea&s;t Indication of the torturing Angui&s;h that preyed upon his Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="270">The Counte&s;s was not long before &s;he di&s;|covered the painful Situation of her Lover. The Re&s;traint he laid upon him&s;elf in not di&s;|clo&s;ing the Cau&s;e of it to her, was a new Proof of his Re&s;pect which claimed &s;ome Re|turn. She was re&s;olved not to let him lan|gui&s;h any longer under &s;uch cruel Enquietude, and was therefore the fir&s;t to propo&s;e leaving <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> &s;he alledged that the Air of that Province did not agree with her con&s;ti|tution, and &s;he de&s;ired he would conduct her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to &s;ome Place where her Health might be le&s;s endangered. The Che|valier who did not penetrate into the Coun|te&s;s's &s;ecret Rea&s;ons for being de&s;irous to leave <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> was exce&s;&s;ively rejoyced that a Propo&s;al &s;o agreeable to his Wi&s;hes had fir&s;t come from her&s;elf, he would have been wretched had he imagined &s;he had perceived his Jealou&s;y, for although in Lovers it may be con&s;idered as a Proof of the Violence of their Pa&s;&s;ion; yet in a favoured one it argues &s;ome injurious Di&s;tru&s;t of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, which a Woman of any Delicacy cannot ea&s;ily prevail upon her&s;elf to pardon. The Chevalier therefore wi&s;ely concealing the particular Intere&s;t he had in the Counte&s;s's leaving <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> replied calmly that he would attend her when ever &s;he plea&s;ed, and advi&s;ed her to make <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> the Place of her Retreat, he a&s;&s;ured her that in that Province there were &s;everal &s;trong Ca&s;tles, at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from the Court that they need not be under any Apprehen&s;ions of being &s;urprized, although it
<PB N="270" REF="271">
&s;hould be di&s;covered that they were there, he added that by being nearer their Friends and E&s;tates they might avoid many Inconve|niencies to which they were now &s;ubjected in that Country.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s approved of his Advice, but being re&s;olved to take no Step of that Kind without fir&s;t con&s;ulting her Father, &s;he told the Chevalier that they mu&s;t defer their Departure till &s;he had wrote to the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and received his An&s;wer. It was not long before the An&s;wer they waited for arrived, it filled the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> with Joy, but it was not favourable to the Wi&s;hes of the poor Chevalier, as he found he &s;hould for a long Time be deprived of the Pre&s;ence of her who was dearer to him than any other Per&s;on in the World.</P>
<P>The old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> in|formed his Daughter that the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> for &s;o we mu&s;t now call her Brother-in-law, had left <HI>Paris,</HI> together with the Marquis his Son, to go in &s;earch of <HI>Verague,</HI> that he him|&s;elf was preparing to go to Court to &s;olicit a Pardon for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> on Ac|count of his Duel with the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> that he would engage &s;o many Per&s;ons of Di&s;|tinction in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e, and u&s;e &s;uch Methods as he hoped would entirely undeceive the grand Monarque, who had &s;uffered him&s;elf to be influenced by his Regard for the Favourite to the Prejudice of the Chevalier.
<Q>When his
<PB N="271" REF="272">
Pardon, for the Death of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> is obtained, added the old Marquis; he will then be at Liberty to come and defend his Innocence with Regard to the Accu&s;ation he &s;uffers under, as well as you; but till this is effected, I de&s;ire you will &s;et out immediately to attend the Mar|chione&s;s your Mother, who will not be able in the Grief &s;he is in for your Ab&s;ence, to &s;upport the additional Weight of mine.</Q>
He then advi&s;ed his Daughter to take her Rout through <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Franche Comte,</HI> from whence &s;he might travel to <HI>Burgundy</HI> with le&s;s Danger of a Di&s;covery, and con|cluded with the mo&s;t affectionate Prayers for her Health and Safety.</P>
<P>The Chevalier was greatly afflicted at this unexpected Order, he had been u&s;ed for &s;ome Time pa&s;t to the Sight of his dear Counte&s;s, almo&s;t every Day: the Idea of a long Ab&s;ence plunged him into the mo&s;t cruel De&s;pair, yet he re&s;olved to make a generous Effort upon him&s;elf, and give Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> a new Proof of his Love, by obeying without mur|muring the Commands of her Father. The Agonies it co&s;t him to make this Re&s;olution, were but too vi&s;ible in his Countenance and Behaviour, the tender Sorrow that langui&s;hed in his Eyes, his painfully &s;uppre&s;&s;ed Sighs, the Solitude he now courted to indulge a Melancholly, which even in her pre&s;ence &s;eemed wholly to engro&s;s him, could not e&s;cape the Notice of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> and

filled her with &s;ympathi&s;ing Grief. So per|fect a Re&s;ignation to her Father's Will, &s;uch a boundle&s;s Re&s;pect for hers, even to the Lo&s;s of all his Happine&s;s, touched the Heart of the Counte&s;s more than the mo&s;t pathetick Complaints could have done, &s;he re&s;olved to neglect nothing which depended meerly upon her&s;elf, to calm his Griefs, and to enable him to &s;upport her Ab&s;ence. After enumerating to him all the Obligations he had conferred upon her Family and her&s;elf, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him that her Gratitude being &s;o much engaged by his Services, her Heart had readily received the tender Impre&s;&s;ion, a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o pure and di&s;intere&s;ted had in&s;pired. &mdash; Here &s;he &s;toped abruptly, when the Chevalier in a Tran&s;port of Joy threw him&s;elf upon his Knees, and be&s;ought her to have Compa&s;&s;ion upon the mi&s;erable Condition to which he &s;hould be reduced if &s;he &s;uffered him to leave her without giving him her Hand.
<Q>Let me have the un&s;peakable Happine&s;s Madam, cried he, to call you mine, before this cruel Parting. How &s;hall I &s;upport your Ab&s;ence if any Po&s;&s;ibility remains of lo&s;ing you? if the Torments I have &s;o long en|dured while I langui&s;hed with a hopele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion, have any Claim to your Pity, if my Fidelity has any Title to reward; Oh! &s;often the Pangs of Separation, by con&s;ent|ing to be mine.</Q>
Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was greatly affected with this pa&s;&s;ionate Sup|plication, but &s;he would not leave her Lover a Moment in Su&s;pence upon a Point
<PB N="373" REF="274">
whereon &s;he her&s;elf was &s;o ab&s;olutely de|termined; her Tenderne&s;s for a Man &s;o worthy of her utmo&s;t E&s;teem had at all Times yielded to her Duty, nor would &s;he &s;uffer it now to triumph over the care of her Reputation: after obliging him to ri&s;e, &s;he re|pre&s;ented to him with her u&s;ual Sweetne&s;s, that a Marriage &s;olemni&s;ed in a foreign Country, while they were accu&s;ed of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of her decea&s;ed Lord, would cover them both with Infamy; that the Duty and Re&s;pect &s;he owed her Parents required that her Choice &s;hould have the Sanction of their Con&s;ent, and her Reputation was too dear to her to &s;uffer her to think of Mariage till her Innocence was as well known to the World, as it was to her own Heart: &s;he a&s;&s;ured him that when they had triumphed over the Malice of their Accu&s;ers, and that they were fully ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of all <HI>France,</HI> &s;he would follow the Impul&s;e of her Gratitude and Tenderne&s;s, that Ab&s;ence &s;hould never weaken her Regard for him, or blot him for one Moment out of her Re|membrance, and that if the Malice of their Fate &s;hould make it impo&s;&s;ible for her to be his, &s;he never would be anothers.</P>
<P>The Chevalier yieled to the Force of her Rea&s;ons, and with the mo&s;t tender Tran&s;ports received the A&s;&s;urances &s;he was plea&s;ed to give him of being only his. Again at her feet he vowed eternal Con&s;tancy. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> could not hide her Emotion when with a re&s;|pectful
<PB N="274" REF="275">
Awe he took her Hand, and &s;ealed his Vows upon it with his Lips, while a &s;truggling Sigh &s;eemed to rend that manly Heart which was the Seat of every Virtue, and Tears of mingled Grief and Tenderne&s;s gu&s;hed from his Eyes; &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew her Hand, but not till by an almo&s;t imperceptible Pre&s;|&s;ure of his, &s;he &s;hewed &s;he was not offended at the Favour he had &s;natched, and retiring to her own Apartment, indulged the &s;weetly painful Emotions of her Soul, in Tears that &s;he had hitherto with Difficulty re&s;trained.</P>
<P>The Preparations for their Journey being made with the utmo&s;t Privacy, and Expedition, the Counte&s;s and the Chevalier &s;et out very early in the Morning, in a Coach e&s;corted by their Servants well mounted and armed, one of whom led a Hor&s;e for the Chevalier to make u&s;e of upon Occa&s;ion. They con|tinued their Rout two Days without Interrup|tion, but on the Third the Chevalier's Gen|tleman came up to the Coach and told him that they were pur&s;ued by &s;ix Hor&s;e|men who would infallibly be up with them in a few Minutes. The Chevalier in&s;tantly leaped out of the Coach, and mounted his Hor&s;e, leaving Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> almo&s;t fainting with her Fears; it was in vain that he pro|te&s;ted to her he would lo&s;e his Life rather than &s;uffer her to fall under the Power of her Enemies, &s;o &s;ad an Alternative only increa&s;ed her Grief, with Eyes and Hands lifted up, &s;he earne&s;tly implored the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hea|ven,
<PB N="275" REF="276">
and collecting all her Fortitude to her Aid, &s;ilently waited the I&s;&s;ue of this Adventure. The Chevalier had ordered the Coach to go on, while he with his Gen|tlemen, his faithful <HI>Bi&s;cayan,</HI> and two Gentle|men of <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> waited undauntedly for the Enemy. As &s;oon as they came near, the Chevalier knew the foremo&s;t to be the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Nobleman, who was in Love with the Counte&s;s: the Sight of his Rival added to his natural Courage all the Fury that Hate and Jealou&s;y could in&s;pire. The <HI>German</HI> was for pur&s;uing the Coach, but the Che|valier ru&s;hing in his Way, bid him pro|ceed upon his Peril, and a&s;ked him, with what Intention he followed that Coach. The <HI>German,</HI> with horrid Oaths, replied, that he would have the Lady. The Che|valier made no other An&s;wer than by firing his Pi&s;tol at his Rival; but mi&s;&s;ing his Aim, the <HI>German</HI> and his Men fired upon the Chevalier and his Attendants, and at this fir&s;t Di&s;charge, his Gentleman and the two <HI>Frie&s;landers</HI> fell to the Ground. The Chevalier tran&s;ported with Rage at this Sight, clapping Spurs to his Hor&s;e, ru&s;hed through the mid&s;t of his Enemies, and coming up clo&s;e to the <HI>German,</HI> &s;hot him through the Head. He then drew his Sword, and being &s;econded by his faithful <HI>Bi&s;cayan,</HI> he overturned all that oppo&s;ed him; the <HI>Germans,</HI> di&s;mayed at the Death of their Ma&s;ter, and the Impetuo&s;ity of the Che|valier,
<PB N="276" REF="277">
who had made two of their Compa|nions bite the Ground, turned their Hor&s;es Heads, and fled with the utmo&s;t Precipi|tation, while the Chevalier and his Servant galloped after the Coach, and never &s;top|ped till they had pa&s;&s;ed the Frontiers of <HI>Frie&s;land.</HI> The Chevalier had received &s;ome &s;light Wounds, but tho&s;e of his faithful <HI>Bi&s;cayan</HI> were much more dangerous. The Ian they alighted at, being at a great Di&s;tance from any Town, there was no Surgeon to be had, and the Chevalier was obliged to dre&s;s his own Wounds and his Servant's as well as he could. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was greatly alarmed for her Lover, but he a&s;&s;ured her, that he felt &s;o little Inconveniency from his Hurts, that he was able to attend her as &s;oon as the Hor&s;es had baited. The <HI>Bi&s;cayan</HI> indeed was obliged to be put to Bed; he was dangerou&s;ly wound|ed in the Shoulder. The Chevalier de&s;ired a Surgeon might be &s;ent for with the ut|mo&s;t Expedition, and leaving him Money to defray all his Expences, ordered him as &s;oon as he was cured, to join him in <HI>Ga&s;|cony.</HI></P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> and the Chevalier, after taking a little Refre&s;hment, again entered the Coach, the Counte&s;s gave &s;ome Tears to the Memory of the Chevalier's Gentleman, for who&s;e Lo&s;s his Ma&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed great Con|cern. They met with no Accident the re|maining
<PB N="277" REF="278">
Part of their Journey, and arrived happily in <HI>Franche Comte.</HI> The Counte&s;s, at her Lover's earne&s;t Intreaty, re&s;ided eight Days at <HI>Be&s;an&ccedil;on,</HI> and then re&s;umed their Rout to <HI>Burgundy.</HI> The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur's</HI> Ca&s;tle was but two Days Journey from <HI>Auxerre:</HI> the Chevalier's Heart was di|vided between Grief and Joy, when he &s;ur|rendered the Counte&s;s to the Arms of her in|dulgent Mother, who received her with in|expre&s;&s;ible Tran&s;ports. That &s;he was now in Security, was a Circum&s;tance which could not but give him the highe&s;t Satisfaction; but when he con&s;idered that he mu&s;t &s;oon leave her, that it might be long e'er he beheld her again, he &s;uffered Torments which can only be imagined by tho&s;e who have loved like him, and like him been torn from the Object of their Affections. The old Mar|chione&s;s relea&s;ing her Daughter from her Embraces, turned towards the Chevalier, and in Terms that expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Gratitude, thanked him for her Safety: &s;he told him, that the Marquis had eight Days ago &s;et out for <HI>Paris,</HI> on the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s he had mentioned to the Counte&s;s in the Letter he had wrote to her, and that he would &s;end him Notice in <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> what Succe&s;s he had at Court. It was nece&s;&s;ary, for this Rea&s;on, as well as for his own Secu|rity, that the Chevalier &s;hould go into that Province immediately. He had an Uncle there, who was very much advanced in Years, and to who&s;e va&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he was Heir,
<PB N="278" REF="279">
who earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee him: as he found he mu&s;t leave the Counte&s;s, he re&s;olved to ru&s;h at once into his Mi&s;ery; and after re&s;t|ing one Night at the Ca&s;tle <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur,</HI> he took Leave of the Marchione&s;s and Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> and pur&s;ued his Way to <HI>Ga&s;cony.</HI></P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, who &s;aw her Daughter &s;wallowed up in Affliction, omitted nothing which maternal Fondne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t, to comfort her; but as her Con&s;olations were wholly applied to the Misfortunes &s;he had lately &s;uffered, on account of the vile Accu&s;a|tion &s;he had laboured under, &s;he did not reach the Bottom of the Counte&s;s's Grief, who was pierced to the Heart by the De&s;pair that was vi&s;ible in her Lover's Eyes, notwith&s;tanding his a&s;&s;umed Compo&s;ure at parting.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, full of unea&s;y Thoughts, that made him wholly regardle&s;s of his Safety, took <HI>Paris</HI> in his Way to <HI>Ga&s;cony:</HI> he was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing his Friends there, and arriving at <HI>Charenton</HI> at Five o'Clock in the Evening of the third Day after his Departure from the Ca&s;tle <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> he rode &s;lowly on, not being willing to enter <HI>Paris</HI> till it was dark. A Noi&s;e of &s;ome Hor&s;es be|hind him made him apprehen&s;ive that he was di&s;covered and pur&s;ued, he turned ha&s;tily to &s;ee who they were that were riding after him, and perceived four Archers of the Provo&s;t, conducting a Pri&s;oner who&s;e Legs were fa&s;ten|ed
<PB N="279" REF="280">
under his Hor&s;e's Belly. Although the Chevalier had but a &s;light View of this Pri|&s;oner, yet he imagined he knew the Face; he rode up to the Archers, and de&s;ired to know who their Pri&s;oner was, and whither they were conducting him.
<Q>We are carry|ing him, replied one of them, to the little Chatelet, where he was formerly Turnkey; but we &s;hould have enough to do, added he in a &s;urly Tone, if we an&s;wered all the im|pertinent Que&s;tions that are a&s;ked us.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier, without heeding the Fel|lows Rudene&s;s, was reflecting upon the Mis|fortune of the poor Turnkey, and upon the Means he &s;hould u&s;e to deliver him. Grati|tude as well as Compa&s;&s;ion &s;ugge&s;ted to him that he ought not to let this poor Wretch &s;uf|fer for an Action which he had drawn him in to commit, and of which the Counte&s;s and him&s;elf had all the Benefit; he therefore again acco&s;ted the Archers, and with great Mild|ne&s;s repre&s;ented to them, that the unhappy Man would certainly be hanged if they car|ried him to Pri&s;on;
<Q>and you, &s;aid he, will then be concerned at the Part you have had in precipitating his Death; if you will de|liver him to me, I will give you twenty Pi&s;toles to drink, and you will bind the poor Wretch to pray for you as long as he lives.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We neither care for his Prayers, nor your Pi&s;toles, &s;aid one of them, who had
<PB N="280" REF="281">
not yet &s;poke, and po&s;&s;ibly it would be bet|ter for you if you were le&s;s charitable than you are.</Q>
<Q>How, replied the Chevalier a little alarmed, do you intend to make me Pri&s;oner for being too charitable?</Q>
<Q>I do not &s;ay &s;o, replied the Archer; but if tho&s;e by whom we are commi&s;&s;ioned to bring this Man Pri&s;oner to <HI>Paris,</HI> were to know your Offers, they would force you to declare what Intere&s;t you have in his E&s;cape from Ju&s;tice.</Q>
Leave that Care
<Q>to Ju&s;tice, returned the Chevalier, who began to be enraged, and at pre&s;ent think of nothing but delivering this Man to me, for I will ab&s;olutely have him. I de&s;ire you will unbind him this In&s;tant, and re&s;ign him into my Hands for nothing, &s;ince you have refu&s;ed my Money, and if you do not comply willingly, know that I will have him from you by Force.</Q></P>
<P>The Archers &s;tared upon one another in A&s;toni&s;hment, at this arrogant Speech: they thought the Chevalier was a Madman, and were more inclined to laugh at his Extrava|gance, than di&s;pute with him for their Pri&s;o|ner; but when they &s;aw him fall upon them Sword in Hand, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Valet de Chambre and a Lackey he had brought from <HI>Burgundy,</HI> they prepared in good earne&s;t for a vigorous Defence. The Chevalier dealt his Strokes with &s;uch Rapidity and Succe&s;s among the Archers, that two fell immediately to the Ground, his Servants di&s;patched another, and
<PB N="281" REF="282">
the fourth fled towards <HI>Vincennes,</HI> leaving the poor trembling Pri&s;oner in the Hands of his Deliverer, for whom, during the Combat, he had offered up the mo&s;t ardent Prayers. The Chevalier ordered his Valet to take off his Irons, and then making him&s;elf known, he congratulated him upon his Freedom; the Turnkey, ravi&s;hed with Joy and Gratitude, fell at his Feet, and vowed the Life he had pre&s;erved &s;hould from thenceforwards be whol|ly at his Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>They now rode with all Speed towards <HI>Pa|ris:</HI> the Chevalier altered his Intention of &s;topping there, on account of his Adventure with the Archers, and continued his Journey to <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> whither he arrived at the Break of Day; he re&s;ted about two Hours, and then taking Po&s;t with the Turnkey, who never afterwards quitted him, he arrived &s;afe at his Uncles E&s;tate, which was a few Days Jour|ney from <HI>Bordeaux.</HI> The old Man, who had not &s;een him during ten Years be|fore, received him with Tran&s;ports that had like to have been fatal to his Health. He wept at the Recital of the &s;everal Dangers and Mis|fortunes which had happened to him in the Cour&s;e of &s;o many Years, and earne&s;tly con|jured him to expo&s;e him&s;elf no more to the Caprice of Fortune, but to live with him in Security and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The News of the Chevalier's Arrival being &s;pread over the Province, all the neighbouring
<PB N="282" REF="283">
Gentry came in Crouds to vi&s;it him, and to &s;hew their Joy for his Return: he had the Sa|tisfaction, a few Days afterwards, to &s;ee again his faithful <HI>Bi&s;cayer,</HI> who was perfectly reco|vered of his Wounds. The Tenderne&s;s his Uncle expre&s;&s;ed for him, and the obliging So|licitude of his Friends to divert and plea&s;e him, &s;u&s;pended for &s;ome Time the Agonies of a Pa&s;&s;ion which had hitherto been traver&s;ed by &s;o many cruel Accidents. But we &s;hall now leave him to enjoy a &s;hort-lived Repo&s;e, and &s;ee what Succe&s;s the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> had at Court.</P>
<P>His Impatience to &s;erve the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> would not permit him to delay go|ing to the <HI>Louvre</HI> the Day after his Arrival, to &s;olicit the King in his favour; he extol|led in Terms worthy of the Fervor of his Friend&s;hip, the Valour and Genero&s;ity of the Chevalier, of which on many different Oc|ca&s;ions he had given the mo&s;t &s;hining Proofs. He dwelt upon his un&s;haken Fidelity when di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and a Fugitive in the Court of the Archduke, per&s;ecuted by the Laws, and under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of his Sovereign; he had re|fu&s;ed a very con&s;iderable Pen&s;ion, and di&s;|claimed his Protection, if he mu&s;t purcha&s;e it by the &s;malle&s;t Violation of his Duty. The Marquis then throwing him&s;elf at the King's Feet, mode&s;tly reminded him of his pa&s;t Ser|vices, and with Tears conjured him to have Compa&s;&s;ion on his old faithful Soldier, &s;ink|ing under the Weight of Years and Infirmi|ties,
<PB N="283" REF="284">
and made mi&s;erable by the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of a worthy Son-in-law, and the unde&s;erved Sufferings of his Daughter.</P>
<P><Q>To &s;often the&s;e Calamities, &s;aid the good old Man, grant me, I conjure your Ma|je&s;ty, the Pardon of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> for unfortunately killing the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> in a Duel which he could not in Honour or Ju&s;tice avoid, after the Attempt that was made upon his Per&s;on by a Kin&s;man of the Count, and by his Orders.</Q>
He then re|pre&s;ented to the King, that the Count, in his An&s;wer to the Chevalier's Challenge, had in a manner confe&s;&s;ed the Charge, and therefore ju&s;tly de&s;erved the Fate he had met with.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances of the Chevalier's Combat with the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> had by his Friends been repre&s;ented to the King, in a manner very different from the Truth; pre|judiced by tho&s;e Reports, and the Tender|ne&s;s he had borne to the Decea&s;ed, he an|&s;wered the Marquis with &s;ome little Indig|nation,
<Q>That he had been prevailed upon to pardon Duelli&s;ts, when their Quarrel had been fairly decided by the Sword; but that he had never &s;kreened A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins from Ju&s;tice;</Q>
and expre&s;&s;ed a great A&s;to|ni&s;hment that the Marquis &s;hould &s;o earne&s;t|ly implore Pardon for a Man who had been accu&s;ed of murdering his Son-in-law.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="285"><Q>I do not, Sire, replied the Marquis, im|plore your Pardon for an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, but for a Man who has bravely killed his Enemy in a fair Fight; no, if it can be proved that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> has murdered my Son-in-law, I would be the fir&s;t to intreat that he might &s;uffer the Puni&s;hment due to &s;uch a Crime, but being fully per&s;uaded of his Innocence with regard to my Son's A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, I am come to &s;olicit his Par|don for a le&s;&s;er Offence, in order that he may be at Liberty to clear him&s;elf of a greater.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Marquis, an&s;wered the King, the Rela|tions of the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> are convinced that the Chevalier killed that Nobleman ba&s;ely, although they po&s;&s;ibly do not be|lieve him guilty of your Son-in-law's Mur|der. Thus every one li&s;tens to the Dic|tates of his own private Re&s;entment for &s;uppo&s;ed Wrongs; but I, who am not a Party, but a Judge, in this Cau&s;e, will ren|der to each the Ju&s;tice that is due to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Permit me, Sire, returned the old Man, to repre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty, that no one is condemned till he has been heard in his own Defence. I am &s;olicitous to procure the Chevalier's Pardon for the Count of <HI>Polan's</HI> Death, that he may clear him&s;elf of my Son's Murder. My Daughter's Character labours under the &s;ame odious Calumny; her Ju&s;tification is included in
<PB N="285" REF="286">
that of the Chevalier. In this Ca&s;e the Ac|cu&s;ed and the Accu&s;ers are in a like Un|certainty. Surmi&s;es only can be oppo&s;ed to Surmi&s;es; but if your Maje&s;ty will, on this Occa&s;ion, follow the Example of &s;ome of your glorious Predece&s;&s;ors, when in Ca|pital Crimes there was neither &s;ufficient Evidence to condemn or to acquit, and allow the Parties to decide their Cau&s;e by the Sword, Providence and a ju&s;t Cau&s;e will, I doubt not, enable the Chevalier, to make good his Challenge, let who will be the Oppo&s;er.</Q></P>
<P>The King was at Dinner, while the Mar|quis, with friendly Zeal and hone&s;t Elo|quence, was pleading the Chevalier's Cau&s;e. Among other Noblemen, who attended at his Maje&s;ty's Chair, was the young Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> Brother to him whom the Chevalier had killed. This young Lord had already acquired a great Reputation for per&s;onal Va|lour: the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> had &s;carce fini&s;hed his Speech, when he threw him&s;elf at the King's Feet, and conjured him not to let the Death of a Brother &s;o dear to him, and who had been killed by the Cheva|lier contrary to the known Rules of Duelling, go unrevenged for want of &s;ufficient Proofs, but permit him to challenge the Chevalier to &s;ingle Combat.</P>
<P><Q>Count, interrupted the old Marquis, were it not that we are in the Pre&s;ence of the
<PB N="286" REF="287">
greate&s;t King in the World, to whom I owe an inviolable Re&s;pect, I would not tamely &s;uffer you to charge the Cheva|lier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> with having ba&s;ely killed your Brother; he is too noble and too generous to commit any di&s;honourable Action, and too brave to have Recour&s;e to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, to rid him of an Enemy, or unju&s;tifiable Methods to overcome him. Loaden as I am with Years and Afflictions, this Arm wants not Strength, nor this Heart Courage to defend the Chevalier again&s;t &s;o ba&s;e an Accu&s;ation: and if his Maje&s;ty will permit it, I am ready whenever you plea&s;e to prove with my Sword, that what you have a&s;&s;erted again&s;t my Friend, is fal&s;e. I would rather, replied the young Count of <HI>Polan</HI> with a &s;cornful Smile, meet your Son than you upon this Occa&s;ion; but when I have done with you, I will &s;upport the Truth of what I have &s;aid again&s;t your Son, and again&s;t the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> like|wi&s;e, if he dares accept my Challenge.</Q></P>
<P>The good old Marquis, enraged at this In&s;olence, was going to reply with &s;ome Warmth, when the King impo&s;ed Silence upon them both, and forbid them, upon Pain of his highe&s;t Indignation, to proceed any further in this Affair. Afterwards that Prince, feeling the Force of tho&s;e Arguments the old Marquis urged in favour of the Chevalier, as well as the Duty and Fidelity he had &s;hewn in refu&s;ing a Pen&s;ion from the Archduke at a
<PB N="287" REF="288">
Time when his Protection was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for his Safety, he granted him a Pardon for the Death of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> upon Condi|tion that he returned to <HI>Paris</HI> within a Month, to clear him&s;elf of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Count of <HI>Berci.</HI></P>
<P>The old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> tran&s;|ported with Joy that he had thus happily car|ried his Point, returned to <HI>Burgundy</HI> with great Expedition, where he had the Satisfac|tion to find his Daughter already arrived: be|ing informed by her of the particular Place where the Chevalier re&s;ided, he &s;ent a Gen|tleman po&s;t that very Day with his Pardon, which he accompanied with the following Letter:</P>
<P><Q>I have, at length, Mon&s;ieur, had the good Fortune to touch the Heart of the mo&s;t ju&s;t and benevolent of King's, by the Repre&s;en|tations I have made in your favour. The Bearer of this will deliver your Pardon for your la&s;t Duel, in Form. There is now no|thing to hinder you from appearing to clear your Innocence with re&s;pect to the lamented Murder of my dear Son-in-law, and to cover with Confu&s;ion and Di&s;grace tho&s;e who have blackened your Fame, and that of my Daughter. I am not, through pa|ternal Tenderne&s;s, more &s;olicitous for her Ju&s;tification, than, through Gratitude and Friend&s;hip, for yours. I would have &s;ent my Son to you with this News, if I had

<P>The Marquis having communicated this Letter to his Lady, &s;he told him, that, her Daughter being &s;o much concerned in this Affair, it was proper that &s;he al&s;o &s;hould write to the Chevalier: the Marquis approved of the Propo&s;al, and de&s;ired Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> to write to their common Friend, which &s;he did with great Willingne&s;s, in the&s;e Terms:</P>

<P>The Me&s;&s;enger having received the&s;e Di&s;|patches, and proper In&s;tructions where to find the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> in <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> &s;et out for that Province immediately. His Return was expected with extreme Impatience by the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI>; but an unfortunate Acci|dent happened, which produced great Di&s;orders in the Chevalier's Affairs: the Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent in a Sea&s;on of the Year when the Waters had ro&s;e very high, and travelling was both dan|gerous and tedious; as he was riding along the Side of a little River which had overflowed great Part of the Road, he perceived that the Po|&s;tillion was got beyond his Depth, and was in Danger of being lo&s;t, together with his Hor&s;e; eager to &s;ave the Youth, he advanced ha&s;tily, to lay hold of him by the Neck, but the Bank upon which he &s;upported him&s;elf, &s;uddenly gave way, and his Hor&s;e &s;tumbling, he fell into the Water and both he and his Po&s;tilion were drowned. By this fatal Accident the Chevalier was prevented from appearing at Court within the Time pre&s;cribed, which brought on the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> and him&s;elf many cruel Misfortunes: but let us now &s;ee how the Chevalier employed him&s;elf in his Retirement where he was perfectly ignorant of all that had pa&s;&s;ed at Court.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="291">The old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> his Uncle; who was extremely rich, and had no other Heir but the Chevalier, was laying Schemes in his own Mind to fix him in <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> for the re&s;t of his Life; he dreaded his Return to Court, le&s;t &s;ome new Misfortune &s;hould deprive him for ever of a Nephew he &s;o tenderly loved, and who&s;e Pre&s;ence was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his Happine&s;s. He re&s;olved therefore to make his Connexions in <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;hould not be in his Power to break them, and this was only to be done by marrying him ad|vantagiou&s;ly. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Genvincourt</HI> was the Lady he pitched upon for a Wife for the Chevalier, &s;he was young, beautiful, and had the greate&s;t Fortune in the Province, &s;he had been left an Orphan in her earlie&s;t Years under the Guardian&s;hip of a Kin&s;man of her Father, who for &s;ome Time very faith|fully di&s;charged his Tru&s;t, he carefully applied him&s;elf to improve the great Qualities &s;he had received from Nature by an excellent Educa|tion; the &s;urprizing Progre&s;s &s;he made in every Kind of Learning, and the con&s;um|mate Loveline&s;s of her Per&s;on, excited an Ad|miration of her in the Heart of her Guardian, which when &s;he grew older, terminated in a mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion; his advanced Age, his Proximity of Blood, his low Fortunes (low when compared to hers) were Con&s;iderations too weak to hinder him from declaring his Sentiments to his ward and to &s;olicit ear|ne&s;tly for her Hand. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Ge|vincourt</HI> with a Mind as haughty as ever Wo|man's
<PB N="291" REF="292">
was, had all the Courage, Fortitude and Re&s;olution of the mo&s;t intrepid Man. Her Inclinations from her earlie&s;t Youth had led her to Ma&s;culine Exerci&s;es, and the Make of her Per&s;on, beautiful and finely propor|tioned as it was, fitted her for exelling in them. She was &s;o enraged at her Guardians pre&s;umptuous Declaration, that &s;he would have wi&s;hed to cha&s;ti&s;e his In&s;olence with her own Arm, for her Re&s;entments were no more fe|minine than her Spirit. With a Look of inconceivable Di&s;dain, &s;he de&s;ired him to be &s;ilent for ever upon &s;uch a Subject, if he did not wi&s;h to feel the Effects of her ju&s;t Indig|nation.</P>
<P>The poor Guardian was thunder&s;truck at a Repul&s;e, couched in Terms &s;o very extraor|dinary for a Lady, yet he did not cea&s;e to per&s;ecute her with his Addre&s;&s;es, which &s;o pro|voked the haughty Girl, that &s;he re&s;olved to &s;et him at Defiance. Some little Time after|wards, he was obliged to go into another part of the Province upon Affairs which would nece&s;&s;arily detain him &s;everal Weeks. Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> took this Oppor|tunity to fortify the Ca&s;tle in which &s;he had hitherto lived with her Kin&s;man, and &s;hut her&s;elf up in it with &s;ome of her Friends, when her Guardian returned, &s;he refu&s;ed him Admittance, and ordered him to be gone, otherwi&s;e &s;he would Fire upon him and his Attendants from the Windows; the old Lover retired in De&s;pair, and &s;oon after died with
<PB N="292" REF="293">
meer Shame and Grief for the Treatment he had received from his Charge; this Affair made a great Noi&s;e over all the Province, every one was plea&s;ed with the Spirit and Re|&s;olution of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> her fine Accompli&s;hments, the Charms of her Per&s;on, her noble Birth, and her great Riches brought an innumerable Croud of Lovers to her Feet, but there was not one among&s;t them, who in her Opinion was worthy of her Heart.</P>
<P>It was this incomparable young Lady whom the old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> de&s;igned &s;hould give Fetters to his Nephew. He was not ignorant of her extreme Haughtine&s;s, and her declared Aver&s;ion to Marriage, founded upon her own Fondne&s;s for Liberty, and de&s;ire of Rule; but he hoped every thing from the extraordinary Merit of his Nephew, who&s;e Fame too va&s;t for his Country had ex|tended it&s;elf over all Europe, and made him the Object of Univer&s;al Admiration and E&s;teem; he flattered him&s;elf that Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Ge|vincourt</HI> would be charmed with a Character that &s;o nearly re&s;embled her own, but he did not think it proper to mention his De&s;ign to his Nephew, the Sight of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> he ju&s;tly thought would have more Influence upon his Heart, than all his Arguments or even his Authority, if he was inclined to make u&s;e of it, not but he was acquainted with the Chevalier's Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> and looked on it as an Ob&s;tacle to the Succe&s;s of his Scheme; he
<PB N="293" REF="294">
was too prudent to think of rea&s;oning him out of his Love for that Lady, but he expected a great deal from the Beauty of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> and therefore earne&s;tly wi&s;hed that Chance might throw her in his Way, not doubting but the Sight of &s;o many Charms informed by a Mind great and noble, as his own, would have &s;ui|table Effects upon a Heart who&s;e Sen&s;ibility was but too certain.</P>
<P>The old Marquis having been taken up &s;everal Days in contriving Schemes to bring his Nephew and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> together, at la&s;t bethought him&s;elf of making a Party for the Chace which could not fail of an&s;wering his Purpo&s;e. When this Thought had once entered his Head, he wondered how he could be &s;o long before he hit upon it, he went him&s;elf to invite the fair Amazon, for &s;o &s;he was called all over <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> to honour this Hunting Match with her Pre&s;ence. Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> in&s;tantly complied with his Invitation, &s;he had a great De&s;ire to &s;ee the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> of whom &s;he had heard the mo&s;t extravagant Encomiums, &s;he took a more then ordinary Care that Day in &s;etting off her lovely Per&s;on to the greate&s;t Advantage, her Pride would not &s;uffer her to acknowledge to her&s;elf that &s;he had any De&s;ign upon the Chevalier's Heart, yet &s;he could not help thinking &s;uch a glorious Con|que&s;t would add greatly to the Reputation of her Charms, and &s;he neglected no Ornament
<PB N="294" REF="295">
her hunting Dre&s;s would admit of, to make her&s;elf appear lovely in his Eyes. Her Habit was green Velvet, richly embroidered with Silver, a Dagger the Handle of which was adorned with a great number of Diamonds, hung in a rich Scarf by her Side, her fair Hair played in carele&s;s Ringlets down her Shoulders, &s;he wore a little Hat with a black Feather that waved over part of a Forehead whiter than Ivory, it was adorned with Bril|liants, which bright as they were, yielded in Lu&s;tre, to her large blue Eyes, in which Viva|city and Sweetne&s;s were &s;o happily blended, that the colde&s;t Heart mu&s;t have been in|flamed by their piercing Rays, her Hor&s;e was a Spani&s;h Genet, white as the falling Snow, which &s;he managed with a Grace wholly in|chanting; in this Equipage &s;o well &s;uited to the lovely Fiercene&s;s of her Air and Mein, &s;he rode to meet the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and his Company. The Chevalier although plainly dre&s;t, had a natural Dignity in his Per&s;on, which Negligence of Apparel could neither hide or dimini&s;h; he was mounted upon a very fine Hor&s;e which he managed with equal Skill and Gracefulne&s;s: the manly Sweetne&s;s of his Countenance, the Fire that &s;parkled in his Eyes, his martial Air, &s;oon di&s;covered him to Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> who had been at the place appointed for meeting, a few Moments before the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and his Company.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="296">The Chevalier gazed with A&s;toni&s;hment and Delight upon an Object &s;o new and char|ming; Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> was not le&s;s &s;truck with the noble A&s;pect of our Hero. The Company in whi&s;pers declared that they were the lovlie&s;t Pair in the World, and &s;eemed wholly formed for each other; the old Marquis enjoyed the mutual Admiration with which his Nephew and the charming Amazon beheld each other, but the Effects of this In|terview were va&s;tly different in each. Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> lo&s;t in a Moment that In&s;en&s;ibility of which &s;he had hitherto boa&s;ted, and became pa&s;&s;ionately enamoured of the Chevalier, while her Beauty, Inchant|ing as it realy was, found his Heart &s;o filled with the Idea of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> that it excited no other Sentiments for her than tho&s;e of Admiration and Re&s;pect. The Che|valier eagerly leaping off his Hor&s;e, was pre|&s;ented by the Marquis his Uncle, to the lo|vely Maid, who lightly di&s;mounting advanced to meet him. The Chevalier made her a gallant Compliment which &s;ent new Arrows to her Heart. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> found a &s;ecret Charm in every Thing he &s;aid and did; &s;he &s;carce ever removed her Eyes from his Face; &s;uperior to the little Affecta|tions and Re&s;erve of her Sex, &s;he was not &s;o|licitous to conceal the favourable Sentiments &s;he entertained for him; they never &s;eparated during the Chace. The old Marquis <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars</HI> could hardly contain his Joy at a Succe&s;s &s;o much beyond his Hopes: he did not doubt
<PB N="296" REF="297">
but the Wit and Learning of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> would fini&s;h what her Beauty had begun, and entirely era&s;e all Remembrance of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci.</HI> The Chevalier indeed found Graces in the Conver&s;ation of Mademoi|&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> which greatly increa&s;ed his Admiration and E&s;teem of her. A Man of his Galantry and Vivacity could hardly avoid talk|ing of Love to &s;o charming a Creature, whom he had an Opportunity of entertaining alone: he fell naturally into very pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;|&s;ions, by which however he meant nothing more than to pay that Homage he thought due to a Beauty &s;o attracting, and a Wit &s;o lively and poignant. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> had been too much u&s;ed to make &s;uch &s;udden Con|que&s;ts, to doubt that her Charms had produced their ordinary Effects: &s;he li&s;tened with Plea|&s;ure to the rapturous Language that fell from the Lips of the Chevalier, and although her Heart was &s;en&s;ible of Emotions it had till then been a Stranger to, yet &s;he an&s;wered him with &s;uch ea&s;y Raillery, and a Gaiety &s;o unaffected, that whatever were her Thoughts, they re|mained perfectly hid from the Chevalier.</P>
<P>The Chace fini&s;hed with the taking of a large Stag, and the Company being now ve|ry much fatigued, they were preparing to re|turn home, when a furious Boar ru&s;hed out of a Wood that was near them, and di&s;per&s;ed both the Hunters and the Dogs in an In&s;tant; the intrepid Chevalier alone di&s;dained not to fly, he threw him&s;elf off his Hor&s;e, and ad|vancing
<PB N="297" REF="298">
towards the Boar, with his drawn Sword in his Hand, he thru&s;t it up to the Hilt in the Body of the terrible Bea&s;t: the Wound was mortal, but the furious Animal, in his dying Agonies, &s;prung forwards, and overthrowing the Chevalier, fell down dead a few Paces di&s;tant from him. The Marquis &s;uppo&s;ing his Nephew mortally hurt, &s;ent forth loud Cries of Grief and Con&s;ternation; he was ha&s;tening to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when the fair fierce Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> leaping off her Hor&s;e, flew to rai&s;e him from the Ground, trembling between Hope and Fear, and all the Marks of Terror and Grief printed upon her lovely Face. The Chevalier was already upon his Feet, when the charming Amazon offered her a&s;&s;i&s;ting Hand. The Marquis was by this Time come up to them, as well as the re&s;t of the Hunters; their Fears were now turned to Joy and Exultation; they congratulated the Chevalier upon the Victory he had gained. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt's</HI> Emotions had been &s;o vi&s;ible, that there was not one in the Company who doubted of her Love to the Chevalier; &s;he complimented him, as well as the re&s;t, on his Valour, but the Changes in her fair Face while &s;he was &s;peaking, made it evident, that the Danger he had &s;o lately e&s;caped, was &s;till mo&s;t in her Thoughts. The Chevalier, in Imitation of <HI>Melcager,</HI> cut off the Head of the Boar, and laid it at the Feet of this fairer <HI>Atalanta,</HI> as a Trophy con|&s;ecrated to her Beauty. She accepted it &s;mile|ing, together with the Chevalier's Offer to
<PB N="298" REF="299">
attend her to her Ca&s;tle, where at parting he begged Permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her, which he obtained without Difficulty: but he returned to his Uncle more plea&s;ed than captivated with the Perfections of the lovely Amazon.</P>
<P>Mean time the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> was full of unea&s;y Apprehen&s;ions, on hear|ing no News of the Chevalier: the Term pre&s;cribed by the King for his Appearance, for which he had engaged, was almo&s;t ex|pired; he was amazed that the Me&s;&s;enger whom he had &s;ent to the Chevalier, did not return; he knew not what to think of a De|lay &s;o unaccountable. The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was in De&s;pair, nothing but the mo&s;t fatal Accident could in her Opinion be the Cau&s;e of his not appearing. Anxiety and Su&s;pen&s;e might have &s;ugge&s;ted Doubts of his Love, but his Honour was too well known to ad|mit of the &s;lighte&s;t Su&s;picion again&s;t it. But fearful of her Parents Ob&s;ervations, &s;he &s;mo|thered her Griefs in her own Brea&s;t, and only &s;ilently deplored the various Misfortunes to which her Life was expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Two Days before the Expiration of the Month pre&s;cribed to the Chevalier, the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> arrived at <HI>Paris:</HI> he had &s;pent &s;everal Months in Search of <HI>Ve|rague,</HI> but to no Purpo&s;e; and eager to &s;ee again his beloved Wife, he came back &s;ome Weeks &s;ooner than the Time on which he had agreed to meet the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> at
<PB N="299" REF="300">
<HI>Paris,</HI> who had been employed in the &s;ame fruitle&s;s Search. On his Arrival he was im|mediately informed of the Challenge given by the young Count of <HI>Polan</HI> to his Father and to him&s;elf, in the King's Pre&s;ence, which, at the Command of his Maje&s;ty, was not ac|cepted. The Fire of Youth, and eager De|&s;ire of &s;upporting his Father's Honour upon this Occa&s;ion, as well as his own, would not &s;uffer him to reflect upon the Con&s;equences of di&s;obeying the King, he &s;ent a Challenge to the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> who accepted it with Joy: they met accordingly, and a vigorous Combat en&s;ued; both gave Proofs of great Courage and Skill, and both were &s;o much wounded, that their Attendants were obliged to get Litters to carry them from the Place of Battle to <HI>Paris.</HI> The Friends of the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> did not think him in Safety in that City, therefore, wounded as he was, carried him in the Night to <HI>Cham|piegny,</HI> to a Hou&s;e that belonged to one of them. The young Marchione&s;s, his Wife, almo&s;t dying with her Fears, ha&s;tened thither to attend him: the Marquis, who was now capable of &s;erious Reflexions, a&s;ked her Par|don for expo&s;ing unnece&s;&s;arily a Life that was dear to her, while &s;he, mingling Tears with her &s;oft Reproaches, a&s;&s;ured him that her Fate was involed in his. The old Mar|quis, his Father, lo&s;ing all Expectations of &s;ee|ing the Chevalier, re&s;olved to be at <HI>Paris</HI> on the appointed Day, to fight with the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> in behalf of his Friend, unaccountable
<PB N="300" REF="301">
as the Conduct of that Friend now &s;eemed to him. On his Arrival he was informed, that his Son had been beforehand with him, and that he was dangerou&s;ly wounded, as well as his Antagoni&s;t. The brave old Man was pi|qued at his Son's Forwardne&s;s in &s;natching this Combat out of his Hands: it looked as if he thought him unequal to the Ta&s;k, and he was apprehen&s;ive that it might be ima|gined his Son had, by his Command, met the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> in his &s;tead. The&s;e Con&s;ide|rations, although they excited &s;ome Re&s;ent|ment in the brave old Soldier, yet could not obliterate the Tenderne&s;s of the Father: he &s;ent Notice of his Son's Condition to the Marchione&s;s, his Wife, and &s;et out immediate|ly him&s;elf for <HI>Champiegny,</HI> to vi&s;it him. No|thing pa&s;&s;ed at this Interview, but kind En|dearments on one Side, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Plead|ings for Pardon on the other. The young Marquis grew better every Day; and when Madam <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> his Mother, and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> his Si&s;ter, arrived, they had the Satisfaction to find him out of Danger. Their Apprehen&s;ions and Grief were now changed to Joy: the young Marquis's Reco|very left them nothing to wi&s;h for but the Sight of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and the Di&s;|covery of <HI>Verague,</HI> to make them entirely happy. The Friends of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> &s;eeing that both he and his brave Antagoni&s;t were quite out of Danger, re&s;olved to recon|cile them to each other: they flattered them|&s;elves with being able to effect this the more
<PB N="301" REF="302">
ea&s;ily, as neither of them had any Advantage over the other, and their Quarrel was occa|&s;ioned rather by a Point of Honour, than any Injury given or received. The Count of <HI>Po|lan</HI> and the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> had a mutual Admiration of each other's Va|lour: there is a &s;ecret Sympathy in brave and generous Minds, which in&s;en&s;ibly produces E&s;teem and Kindne&s;s. The Count of <HI>Polan</HI> readily embraced an Opportunity of vi&s;iting the Marquis, with a common Friend of them both: and met with a mo&s;t polite Reception from the Father and the Son. The two Mar|chione&s;&s;es and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> were pre|&s;ent at this Interview, which proved fatal to the Liberty of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> for the Charms of Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> made &s;o ab&s;olute a Conque&s;t of his Heart, that from a mortal Enemy of her Family, he now became one of the mo&s;t zealous Friends to it.</P>
<P>The Count was young, hand&s;ome, and ex|tremely gallant: he had indeed more Vivacity than Wit; but he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the happy Art of &s;aying the mo&s;t common Things in a manner &s;o agreeable, that his Conver&s;ation, by the Ladies e&s;pecially, was always thought plea&s;ing. Madam <HI>de Berci's</HI> Heart was too little at Ea&s;e, to take any Delight in the agreeable Liveli|ne&s;&s;es of this young Nobleman, who know|ing his own Talent, took every Opportunity to di&s;play tho&s;e happy Spirits which in&s;pired good Humour and Chearfulne&s;s wherever he came. The fixed Melancholy that appeared
<PB N="302" REF="303">
in the Countenance and Behaviour of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> repre&s;&s;ed his Gaiety; which, how|ever, was no Advantage to him; a true Lover in&s;en&s;ibly adopts the prevailing Humour of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, be it what it will. The Count of <HI>Polan</HI> made no Figure in a &s;erious Conver&s;a|tion, nor were his Features adapted to Gra|vity; yet his Eyes &s;eemed to take Le&s;&s;ons from the lovely ones of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> he &s;ighed when &s;he did, &s;ympathetically; and Sor|row in her &s;weet Face had &s;uch powerful In|fluence upon his Heart, that lo&s;ing all that Fire and Vivacity, which &s;o particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him, he became pen&s;ive and re&s;erved without knowing that he was &s;o. He ea&s;ily found a Pretence for &s;taying at <HI>Champiegny</HI> a few Days, during which he lo&s;t no Oppor|tunity of &s;eeing the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI>; but the&s;e frequent Interviews increa&s;ed his Flame, without affording him any Hope of his ever being more happy. He &s;aw her &s;o wholly engro&s;&s;ed by Grief, that he dur&s;t not make any Declaration of his Sentiments; he only intreated her to accept of his Services on every Occa&s;ion that offered, to defend her Inno|cence: but he made this Reque&s;t with a Zeal &s;o animated, with &s;uch apparent Tenderne&s;s in his Voice and Eyes, that the Counte&s;s, who knew too much of the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love her&s;elf, to mi&s;take the Cau&s;e of &s;uch extraordinary Emo|tions, ea&s;ily perceived the Impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made in his Heart, which, con&s;idering him as an Enemy to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> rather increa&s;ed than le&s;&s;ened her Di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="304">The Count of <HI>Polan</HI> returned to <HI>Paris</HI> in a State very different from that in which he had left it. He had hitherto been too &s;uc|ce&s;sful with the Ladies, to leave him any Doubt of making an Impre&s;&s;ion upon a Heart wholly di&s;engaged: the Coldne&s;s with which the Counte&s;s received his Offers, he attri|buted to her Regard for the Chevalier, who&s;e ardent Pa&s;&s;ion for her, no one was ignorant of; the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> being fully per&s;uaded that when his Rival was removed, he &s;hould find no other Ob&s;tacle to his Wi&s;hes in the Heart of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute him for his Brother's Death with the ut|mo&s;t Rigor, and &s;acrifice him at once to his Vengeance and his Love.</P>
<P>The Month granted by the King for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to make his Appearance in, being now fully expired, his Pardon was cancelled, and the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> was deter|mined, if po&s;&s;ible, to hinder it from being ever renewed. He remon&s;trated to the King, that the Chevalier's Guilt could no longer be doubted, &s;ince he had neglected to lay hold of his Maje&s;ty's Mercy, which had given him &s;o fair an Opportunity of clearing him&s;elf; he alledged, that his Flight, was, as well a Proof of his Crime, as the Terrors of his Con&s;cience; for brave as he was allowed to be, he would not have &s;hunned the offered Combat, had he not known he had a bad Cau&s;e to &s;upport. The Count then humbly intreated his Maje&s;ty to revoke the Pardon he had granted to the
<PB N="304" REF="305">
Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and to &s;uffer Ju&s;tice to be executed upon the Murderer of his Brother; or at lea&s;t, if in his Ab&s;ence any one was pre|&s;umptuous enough to maintain his Cau&s;e, to permit him to challenge him to the Field, and tru&s;t his Vengeance to the Deci&s;ion of Arms.</P>
<P>The King did not think fit to grant all that the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> demanded, but contented him&s;elf with declaring, that if in the Space of three Weeks the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> did not appear to an&s;wer the Count's Challenge, or &s;ome one for him, his Pardon &s;hould be can|celled, and his Per&s;on wherever he could be &s;eized, delivered into the Hands of Ju&s;tice. He then commanded, that the Combat &s;hould be fought on Hor&s;eback, and in his Pre&s;ence; that the Combatants &s;hould be in compleat Ar|mour, according to the ancient Cu&s;tom of the Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI> The old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> hearing of this Decree, di&s;patched his Son immediately to <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> in Search of the Chevalier, although he was hardly yet reco|vered of his Wound; and having prevailed with the King to order that all Proceedings again&s;t the Counte&s;s his Daughter &s;hould be &s;topt, till farther Informations could be had with regard to her Hu&s;band's Murder, he fixed his Re&s;idence at <HI>Champiegny,</HI> expect|ing with great Anxiety and Impatience the Event of the young Marquis's Journey, in which they were all &s;o much concerned.</P>
