<HEAD>AN ESSAY UPON Buying <HI>and</HI> Selling OF SPEECHES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>And't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BEING to Write of Matters of State, and particularly of &s;ome Steps lately taken by the Ma&s;ters in <HI>State Policy,</HI> I could not pa&s;s over <HI>your Wor&s;hip,</HI> who of late has &s;o Di&s;tingui&s;h'd your &s;elf, as well by Writ|ings and Speeches, as other ways, in Mat|ters of the greate&s;t Moment, and there|fore
<PB N="4" REF="3">
I have Directed this <HI>ESSAY</HI> to your Wor&s;hip, be&s;eeching your Protecti|on on to an Author who has thus ventur'd to reprove a little, the Pride of the Men of great Talents, like your &s;elf; a Practi&s;e which you have made L udable by your great Example, when your Wor&s;hip was pleas'd to Je&s;t with the World a little, and gave your &s;elf the Trouble of telling other Men their Faults, and taking no Care of your own.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pre&s;ume &s;o much upon <HI>your Wor&s;hip,</HI> as to make your own Character illu&s;trate the Work I am upon, however aptly it might &s;uit with the De&s;ign; there are &s;o many other flagrant Examples be|fore me, that I am under no Nece&s;&s;ity of runing the ri&s;que of your Di&s;plea&s;ure; perhaps your Wor&s;hip may &s;ee your own Picture in the Hi&s;tory, as plain as you may de&s;ire, and have &s;ome rea&s;on to ex|pre&s;s your Satisfaction that it is no plainer.</P>
<P>Your Wor&s;hip knows, that in the Ca&s;e of true Satyrs, 'tis <HI>Application makes the A&s;s,</HI> and when Men &s;ee their Crimes touch'd &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, as that it ma&s;ters their Temper, we &s;ay, <HI>It di&s;covers that they are the Men, and that the Coat fits them:</HI> But I doubt not your Wor&s;hip can bear the brief Reflections made here upon a
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;candalous Practi&s;e, without appropriat|ing any Part of it to your &s;elf.</P>
<P>That I may therefore with the more Life repre&s;ent the Crime of <HI>Buying</HI> and <HI>Selling SPEECHES,</HI> I &s;hall give you the Hi&s;tory of <HI>a once famous Per&s;on,</HI> who knowing how &s;ucce&s;sful the Antients practi&s;ed that gainful Trade; with what &s;ecure Mea&s;ures they per&s;ued their Game, and how boldly they made their Market of their Intere&s;t in Parliament; how effe|ctually they Bantered their Soveraign, when they found it for their Advantage, and how &s;ure they were to be Bought off, as &s;oon as they thought fit to OPEN again&s;t the Court; re&s;olv'd, &s;ome few Years agoe, <HI>for the rai&s;ing his declining Fortune, for the &s;atisfying his un&s;atiable Ambition,</HI> and <HI>for &s;upplying the mo&s;t un|mannaging profu&s;e Inclination,</HI> to try the Experiment upon his Prince: You will &s;ee with what dete&s;table Ingratitude he Set Out, with what In&s;olence and A&s;&s;u|rance he Proceeded, and with what ju&s;t Reproach he Mi&s;carry'd.</P>
<P>This Hi&s;tory, <HI>and't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip,</HI> or whether it be a Hi&s;tory or no, will, doubtle&s;s, &s;ufficiently an&s;wer the De&s;ign; for it will fully lay open the ba&s;e Mea|&s;ures
<PB N="6" REF="5">
taken by &s;uch Polititians to get in|to Employment: It will al&s;o lay before <HI>your Wor&s;hip,</HI> the narrow &s;elfi&s;h Ends which many, if not mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have formerly made popular Speeches in the Councils and A&s;&s;emblies of Great Men, pu&s;ht at: HOW they aim'd at their pri|vate Advantages, all the while they made pretences of pleading the Cau&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and the Peoples Liberty. HOW, when they rail'd at the Mi&s;managments of Men in Place, the De&s;ign was not &s;o much the detecting the Frauds of others in great Po&s;ts, in order to have Ju&s;tice done to the Nation, as for the &s;ake of getting them&s;elves put in their Room.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o &s;hew, by the Royal Exam|ple of a Wi&s;e and truly Great Prince, HOW every Government ought to treat &s;uch Creatures as the&s;e; with what ju&s;t Contempt they &s;hould di&s;appoint their Expectations, and HOW they &s;hould al|ways be above the fear either of their Malice or their Treachery.</P>
<P>I doubt not but when <HI>your Wor&s;hip</HI> &s;hall have read this Story, you will join in recommending the &s;candalous Practi&s;e of <HI>Buying</HI> and <HI>Selling</HI> of <HI>Speeches,</HI> to every hone&s;t Mans Dete&s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
The Gentleman I &s;peak of was an <HI>Iri&s;h|man</HI> by Nation, a Man of a Liberal Educa|tion; well Read, e&s;pecially in that excellent School-Accompli&s;hment, call'd, <HI>Cla&s;&s;ick Learning:</HI> He had al&s;o a competent Stock of Natural Wit; and by keeping good Company, and running &s;ome Changes of Fortune, had gone thro' &s;o much Variety as to know the World <HI>prety well,</HI> and the Town <HI>very well;</HI> all which had very much fitted him for Conver&s;ation: His Thoughts were Clear, and he had &s;ome happy Turns in Expre&s;&s;ion which gave &s;ome Beauty to his Di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;pecially if he did not happen to Talk TOO MUCH which, however, he was a little enclin'd to.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Accompli&s;hments he &s;et out in the World, and it was Ob&s;erv'd, That for &s;ome Years before he made him|&s;elf Popular, he was mightily addicted to make Speeches, for which he once got a Friendly Reproof, and was told, <HI>That If he had not a great care of his Mode&s;ty, he would get the general Character of a TALKING FELLOW, the thing which of all Worldly Reproaches, a Wi&s;e Man is mo&s;t affaid of, and mo&s;t &s;tudious to avoid.</HI> His An&s;wer was remarkable it &s;eems, to the Gentleman that was &s;o kind
<PB N="8" REF="7">
as to give him the Caution, <HI>viz. I have Courage enough to carry me over all that.</HI> The Gentleman only Reply'd, <HI>Cou&s;in, Cou&s;in, you &s;hould not call it Courage, call it &mdash;</HI> However, for all his &mdash; or Courage, call it as you will, he had ano|ther more in&s;uperable Ob&s;truction to his Ri&s;ing in the World: For having neither <HI>Vertue</HI> or <HI>Principles,</HI> and, which was &s;till wor&s;e, <HI>No Money</HI> to put him forward in the World, he found it very Difficult to force his Way thro', or, <HI>as I may &s;ay,</HI> over the Belly of the Misfortunes which general|ly attend a Narrow Circum&s;tance; and tho' he had made him&s;elf Agreeable a|mong&s;t &s;ome Men of good Sen&s;e, and had even got Acquaintance with &s;ome above him&s;elf, yet all this could not effectually a&s;&s;i&s;t him to &s;urmount the Fate of his Family, or to ma&s;ter that great Difficulty, <HI>viz.</HI> of &s;eperating between <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Po|verty.</HI></P>
<P>With all his Acquirements, he had &s;ome Vices, which I mu&s;t touch at, that I may make his Hi&s;tory compleat; but I &s;hall be brief in that ungrateful Part of Hi&s;tory: With his <HI>Wit,</HI> (1) he had, <HI>and alas! who is without it,</HI> an unbridled Pa&s;&s;ion for his own dear Praiee: Impati|ent to the la&s;t degree of the lea&s;t Re|proach,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
nay, tho' it were ju&s;t; and yet this Exorbitance did not at all re&s;train him from laying him&s;elf open every Day to the mo&s;t ju&s;t Satyr, and expo&s;ing him|&s;elf a thou&s;and ways, by the mo&s;t un|garded Conduct in the World; but be|lieving it in his power to e&s;tabli&s;h his Character upon the foot of his extraordi|nary Merit, he thought he had a right to &s;top the Enquiries of curious Mallice, into tho&s;e Parts of his Fame which were le&s;s Shining, and that it was a &s;aucy un|mannerly thing for any Man to &s;ay an ill Word of him, however Ju&s;t, or how much Truth &s;oever there might be in the Fact.</P>
<P>To carry on this Haughty Humour, his fir&s;t Care was to let the World believe he was a Per&s;on of BIRTH as well as Merit, and he Carry'd him&s;elf mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly High upon that head: Indeed this was the weake&s;t Step he could ever have ta|ken, becau&s;e there were &s;ome things in his Family, which his Fathers being call'd a <HI>Gentleman</HI> could by no means Ballance; and be&s;ides that, as the Poverty of his Fathers Circum&s;tances expos'd his Chil|dren to be bred up by the Charity of o|thers, &s;o it happen'd, that tho&s;e Relations of his which &s;hew'd that Charity, &s;eem'd
<PB N="10" REF="9">
to have acquir'd the Capa&s;ity by &s;ome &s;candalous Methods.</P>
<P>Now tho' Poverty is rather the <HI>Mi&s;|fortune</HI> than the <HI>Crime</HI> of a Gentleman, yet all Men know, that when there are Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e kinds in the Rear of a Man's Family, it is not thought the wi&s;e&s;t Step that Man can take, to place them in the Front of his own Hi&s;tory; becau&s;e it gives Envy a handle to Speak detractingly: It was this Vanity of his, which caus'd an ill-natur'd Poet of tho&s;e Times, among other bitter Things, to publi&s;h this Di&s;tich upon him, occa&s;i|oned by his un&s;ea&s;onable Boa&s;ting of being a <HI>Gentleman Born.</HI><Q><L>A Gentleman Born, and Charity Bred,</L>
<L>Much Bra&s;s in his Face, more than Brains in his Head.</L></Q></P>
<P>But we pa&s;s over his <HI>Pride,</HI> as a thing too common to Men of Wit: Anex't to this, he had the mo&s;t unhappy Spirit of <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> in his Way of Living, that a Wi&s;e Man could be guilty of; and it was the more Scandalous to him, be|cau&s;e he had no &s;uitable Fund to ju&s;tify or &s;upport it: This Humour was come to &s;uch an extravagant Hight in him,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
that even Good Fortune it &s;elf could not &s;upply it, and this faild not to make him Nece&s;&s;itous even in &s;pight of the Bounty of Princes. This <HI>Poverty</HI> was accompa|ny'd with its con&s;tant <HI>Yoak-Fellow, Debt,</HI> which, however, was grown &s;o natural a Grievance to him, that, like a riveted Gout, which when it is grown familiar to us, we take no Phy&s;ick for, nor are allarm'd at; &s;o to be Dun'd, or Arre&s;ted, was no breach of his Tranquility, nor did he ever load him&s;elf with the unne|ce&s;&s;ary Care of getting out of it, think|ing that tho&s;e People he ow'd Money to, had more need to be Unea&s;y and Thoughtful, about that main Point, <HI>How they &s;hould get him out of their Books,</HI> than he, who&s;e much greater Care was, to find Ways and Means to get farther in.</P>
<P>But being by the&s;e thing reduc'd all mo&s;t to his Primitive State, <HI>viz.</HI> Living upon Charity, at length a Friend let him into the Secret, <HI>viz.</HI> That Railing at Princes, making Satyrs upon Great Men, and long Speeches again&s;t the Vices of the Publick Management; was the be&s;t way that could be thought of, for a Man of his Capacity, to get a &s;tart into the World.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
That nothing was wanting to a Man of his Capacity, but to be known: That for an Author to be Popular, was to be formidable to Great Men, who&s;e Con|duct would very &s;eldom bare a Hi&s;tory, or their Vertues a Character; and that therefore, if he once could E&s;tabli&s;h his Fame in this Town as a <HI>Satyr,</HI> he would find very quickly that he might &s;ell Silence at a good Price, or get enough by one good Speech, to make it worth while to hold his Tongue all his Life after.</P>
<P><HI>Upon this pro&s;pect he &s;et out,</HI> he rail'd in Print upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, very Magnificently, but unhappily &s;unk un|der two Circum&s;tances, (1) He was a|fraid to own what he Writ, and that kept him too much <HI>Jncog.</HI> In the World: And (2) He &s;trook too low, and fell upon Men not able to buy him off.</P>
<P><HI>But he &s;oon found his Mi&s;take,</HI> and in one flaming half Sheet, he made amends for that Mode&s;ty, and fell upon the Grea|te&s;t Men in the Kingdom: In &s;hort, he Damn'd all the <HI>White-Staffs</HI> in the Nation, as Rogues by Employment; and threatn'd what Devili&s;h Things he would Di&s;cover of them in the Proce&s;s of his Studies.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
He had no &s;ooner done this, but it was every Mans Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire who this TALKING Fellow was: There is &s;eldom much difficulty in &s;eek|ing tho&s;e People that de&s;ire to be found; the Author was of ea&s;y acce&s;s, and being found, Ta&s;ted the fir&s;t Fruits of the good Advice given him, and was let know, that one of the greate&s;t <HI>Staffs</HI> in the Na|tion had a mind to Serve him. Imme|diately we receiv'd a full and true Account, <HI>That a Great Man with a White-Staff might be very Hone&s;t; that there was a White-Staff in the World who eminently Merited to be e&s;teem'd; and who&s;e Character it was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to be Frugal of the Publick Money, and Prodigal of his own."</Q></HI></P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t Attempt he made, according to the Advice given him; and having met with Succe&s;s, he was Encouraged afterwards to go on in a more publick Manner: In a cour&s;e of Time he receiv'd &s;ome Civilities from another Per&s;on bearing a <HI>Staff,</HI> and in hopes of more, was heard to &s;ay, <HI>That he had entertain'd indeed &s;ome hard Thoughts of that Gentleman, but that he found he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Genius, Born to Conquer Univer&s;al Prejudice, and that</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<HI>he was afterwards re&s;olv'd to Number him&s;elf among his Friends.</HI></P>
<P>But finding every Man not alike ap|prehen&s;ive of the Power of a &s;harp Pen, and that he knew not how to make him|&s;elf fear'd there, as he expected; his good Opinion abated in a little time.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Soveraign at that time Reigning, influenc'd by the fir&s;t Per&s;on mention'd, had heaped accumulated Royal Favours upon this <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Creature. But after the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them a rea|&s;onable time, the Vallue of them &s;eem'd to abate in his Thought, tho' the Reve|nue of them abated nothing in his Pocket, for Favours to &s;ome Men appear with a different a&s;pect, and &s;ink always in their Magnitude after they have been long enjoy'd.</P>
<P>It was not for want of Application, or of a&s;&s;urance <HI>to Crave,</HI> that the Mortal Wight crep't no higher; but that Age had its &s;hare of Penetration in &s;ome Things, as it had of Mi&s;takes in others; and he was, perhaps &s;ooner than he thought was decent, ob&s;erv'd to di&s;tingui&s;h his dear &s;elf from his attachment to any In|tere&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="14">
or Party, and therefore he thought fit very early to &s;how him&s;elf to be what it &s;eems he thought it was be&s;t, to be in all Governments <HI>viz. a Male|content.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t not &s;ay, <HI>For we mu&s;t do him Ju&s;tice,</HI> that his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Cha|racter of a <HI>Malecontent,</HI> was deriv'd from his ill Nature, for we give that Tri|bute to his Immorality, that he was never Cinical or Moro&s;e in his Temper; But that his Politicks brought him into tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, founded upon the mi&s;|taken Notion of his own Merit, which he always had Prudence enough to keep up an Opinion of, tho' not Mode&s;ty enough to confine it.</P>
<P>Upon this Foundation it was, that he was not ea&s;ily brought to acknow|ledge him&s;elf oblig'd; all ways pretend|ing to have it in his Power, not only to make him&s;elf u&s;eful, but nece&s;&s;ary to the Publick; &s;o that their employ|ing, and &s;upplying him, was all ways to be e&s;teem'd as a Te&s;timony, not of the Soveraign's Good-will, &s;o much as Good Sence; and of their being able to Judge who, or who not, it was their Intere&s;t to be Bountiful to.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
But the Con&s;equences of this &s;hew'd more plainly the Truth of what is here a&s;&s;erted; for no &s;ooner did he find that the Soveraign once dar'd to run the Ri&s;que of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, but he made no difficulty to &s;hew it, and that in the mo&s;t di&s;obliging Way imaginable; In&s;ult|ing the Crown he Serv'd, and carrying it in &s;uch a Manner, as evidently &s;hew'd he doubted not by appearing again&s;t them, to be bought off at a good Price.</P>
<P>But the Soveraign not being in need of his Service, or afraid of his Power, ventur'd his Indignation; and forbore to Purcha&s;e what it was well known could not be Retain'd any longer, than the Royal Bounty &s;hould flow in a manner equal to his unbounded Profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>During this Dilemma of his Affairs, there happen'd a great Revolution in the Government where he liv'd, the Crown being Tran&s;pos'd by that Providence, in whom the Original Right of di&s;po&s;ing all Things remains, from one Head to another; and that Tran&s;po&s;ition giving a round turn to the Admini&s;tration, even from one Extream almo&s;t to another, it gave him al&s;o a new Ri&s;e, and put him into a Po&s;ture to &s;hew him&s;elf again: He was Politician
<PB N="17" REF="16">
enough to act his part in the fir&s;t ap|pearance of Things, and to look like other Men: He had been taught to Cloth him&s;elf with &s;uch &s;hapes as be&s;t might &s;erve his grand De&s;ign; and to this purpo&s;e fail'd not to make all the di&s;obliging Steps which he had taken in the preceeding Reign, pa&s;s for Merit in the next; and happening to have the good Fortune to fall now into the Hands of a Prince of Immen&s;e Benefi|cence, that knew how to engage Inge|nious Spirits beyond their Power of return, and Rewarded in proportion to his own Bounty, rather than the Subjects Character, he fail'd not to meet with an acceptance as much beyond his Expec|tations, as tho&s;e Expectations were above his Merit.</P>
<P>This &s;et him at the fir&s;t da&s;h above all his Rivals, and would have E&s;tabli&s;h'd his Fame, if it had not, to his great Mi&s;|fortune, &s;et him al&s;o above him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But as nothing is more rare, than for one Born in a low Station, to know how to move in ju&s;t proportion to a more extended Orb, &s;o the Velocity of his Motion in his new Sphere was &s;o un|equal
<PB N="18" REF="17">
to him&s;elf, and to what he ought to have been, that it ca&s;t him immediately back into the &s;ame Di&s;order that he was in before: I have hinted ju&s;t now, that the Soveraigns greatne&s;s of Spirit caus'd him to mea&s;ure his Bounty by his own Magnificence, rather than by the bare De&s;ert of the Object, and this was in him a Te&s;t of an exten&s;ive Goodne&s;s: But our <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man run into the con|trary Extream, and mea&s;uring his own Merit by his Princes Bounty, he fell into the mo&s;t gro&s;s and mo&s;t offen&s;ive Ab&s;urdity in Nature; for as it fill'd him with un&s;ufferable Arrogance, by which he became intollerable to his Friends, &s;o it pu&s;h't him upon that mo&s;t &s;candalous Folly of cla&s;hing with him|&s;elf, fixing a &s;tated Contradiction be|tween the Days of his Humiliation, and tho&s;e of his Exhaltation.</P>
<P>Being come this length, there wanted nothing to compleat the ruin of his Character, and make him perfectly Con|temptible, but that he &s;hould think, as formerly he thought, <HI>viz.</HI> That all Re|wards which were not equall to his Ex|travagance, were Extravagantly &s;hort of
<PB N="19" REF="18">
his Merit, and &s;o bring him to Treat his new Benefactor as he had done his former, I mean with Ingratitude.</P>
<P>Fate that had determin'd this Mu&s;h|room the due Puni&s;hment of Up&s;tarts, fail'd not to bring this to pa&s;s al&s;o, by the following Circum&s;tances, with which I &s;hall conclude his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>By the Favour and Bounty of his Prince, of which mention is made, he was &s;o far recommended to the Subject, <HI>Or, which if Fame lies not, was part of the Ca&s;e,</HI> made Capable to recommend him&s;elf, that upon an Election of a Parliament, he was cho&s;en to &s;it in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, for there were new Parliaments frequently call'd in tho&s;e Days, as well as in the&s;e. He was no &s;ooner entred into the Hou&s;e, but even the fir&s;t Day, as Authors relate, he began to make Speeches, and Flattring Panegyricks. Per&s;uing thus the Dictates of his fir&s;t In&s;tructor mo&s;t exactly, for it &s;eems he was told, That in that place was the be&s;t Market for GOOD SPEECHES, and that he might take it for Granted, that to make a long Speech again&s;t the Publick Mannagement, was the only way
<PB N="20" REF="19">
to get a &s;hare in it, according to Mr. <HI>And. Marvill.</HI><Q><L>That Parliament Men &s;hould rail at the Court,</L>
<L>And get a Preferment immediately for't.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon this Principle the unhappy Po|lititian took his Mea&s;ures; he had been Treated, as I have &s;aid, &s;o far above his capa&s;ity of De&s;erving, that had not mo&s;t People known his Character, and that he would &s;oon let his Soveraign &s;ee his Bounty was ill be&s;tow'd, he would al|mo&s;t have arriv'd to the Dignity of be|ing Envied: But that unbounded Spirit of Profu&s;ion, which was however a Judg|ment upon his Ambition, &s;oon made way thro' all that his Princes Bounty had be&s;towed, and he grew Nece&s;&s;itous in the mid&s;t of a Sufficency for a Lord. Three times the God-like Goodne&s;s of his Prince bore with the Infirmity, be|lieving it might be the remains of former Misfortunes, and with no le&s;s than Five Hundred Pounds at a time, if Hi&s;|tory does not mi&s;take, Recruited the <HI>Wity Extravagant.</HI> But it was all in vain, it was a Stream, not a Bucket, an Ocean, not a Stream that mu&s;t be &s;uf|ficient to &s;upply the Out-let of his Va|nity;
<PB N="21" REF="20">
and that Wi&s;dom which was as in|&s;eperable from his Soveraign's ju&s;t Cha|racter as his Bounty, dictated, that in charity to the Lunacy of this Mans Temper, he mu&s;t &s;hut up his Expecta|tion, within the Bounds of what he had in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and that it was the kinde&s;t Thing that could be done for him, to let him know, it was in vain for him to A&s;k, who had already Surfeited.</P>
<P>His Soveraign had almo&s;t as good have declar'd him a Traitor, as told him, <HI>That his Account of Merit was Ballanc'd by pa&s;t Favours;</HI> for his <HI>Merit</HI> being ex|hau&s;ted as well as the <HI>Money,</HI> it follows of cour&s;e, that Ways and Means were to be found out to &s;upply the La&s;t, whether the Fir&s;t were concern'd or no.</P>
<P>The Devil, who, they &s;ay, is the cun|ninge&s;t Fellow at his Trade in the World, finding the Mans Nature Wicked, and his Circum&s;tances Favourable, fail'd not to take hold of the advantage, and pre&s;ented him with an Opportunity, as he fraudu|lently told him, to rai&s;e his Fortunes; Nor did he long &s;tick at the Motion, tho' at the expence of his Vertue.</P>
<P>In a Word, the Advice <HI>Sathan</HI> admi|ni&s;tred,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
was upon the old Foot, <HI>Oppo&s;e the Court, and make your &s;elf Nece&s;&s;ary, then they'l Buy you.</HI> Tho' the Face of this Man was as Ca&s;e-hardn'd as the very Mettal it &s;elf which we call &s;o; yet it is related in his Favour, That he &s;tar|ted at the fir&s;t Propo&s;al, and told the Devil, <HI>It was damn'd Ungrateful,</HI> that <HI>he was a Gentleman Born,</HI> and <HI>he could not do any Thing &s;o ba&s;e;</HI> he did not add, <HI>Get thee behind me Sathan,</HI> becau&s;e there was more Bu&s;ine&s;s between them to Treat of; but he gave him a very hand|&s;ome Repul&s;e it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd.</P>
<P>But <HI>Sathan</HI> is not u&s;ed to be <HI>&s;aid nay.</HI> The Devil knew his In&s;ide, better per|haps, than he did him&s;elf, and Banter'd him upon his Nicety; <HI>A Pox o' your Mode&s;ty,</HI> &s;ays old Belzebub, <HI>is it any more than you have done by all the Benefactors ever you had in your Life? And be&s;ides,</HI> &s;ays the old Prevaricator, <HI>have you not the be&s;t Plea in the World for it?</HI> (viz.) <HI>NECESSITY. Prethee,</HI> Dick, &s;ays he, <HI>try the other Experiment, can you</HI> Starve? <HI>You mu&s;t do one or tother, that you know, therefore Con&s;ider of it.</HI></P>
<P>I do not find that Hi&s;tory has Recor|ded the whole Dialogue between them,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
nor how <HI>the Devil</HI> they made the Bar|gain. But this is Recorded as a certain Truth, <HI>That he came into the Propo&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>Now to cut &s;hort the Story, for the be&s;t part of it is behind, the generous Prince defeated both the Devil and the Traytor, for as &s;oon as he &s;aw his Good|ne&s;s abus'd, he was &s;o far from &s;tooping to gratify the Wicked De&s;ign, and to draw him back by more Gifts, as he ex|pected; that he contemn'd the Impotence of his Malice; with-drew his Favours; and Condemn'd the Wretch to <HI>Rail on.</HI></P>
<P>He continu'd a while according to Sentence, till he was Hi&s;s'd at, and P&mdash;d upon by all wi&s;e Men, his Friends a&s;ham'd of him, and his Ene|mies above him, and that he laid him&s;elf below the dignity of <HI>Lampoon.</HI></P>
<P>In this condition, Heaven in Mercy to him, clear'd up his Under&s;tanding, and he became a mighty Penitent; but as it is not in Man to an&s;wer for Sincerity, and no Man car'd to venture upon one that had been always otherwi&s;e till then: The compa&s;&s;ionate Prince Pardon'd him, gave him a Pen&s;ion for Bread, and laid him up as an Invalid.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
THIS HISTORY, <HI>and't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip,</HI> I was willing to lay before you, that I might have your Wor&s;hip's Opi|nion, whether it is not worth while to bring it upon the Stage <HI>in Terrorem,</HI> to Deter Incendaries from making Speeches again&s;t their Ma&s;ters, and again&s;t their Principles, with a de&s;ign to get up higher in their Favour, tho' they have already been Rewarded in a manner, which it was never in their Power to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but if your Wor&s;hip ca&s;ts your Eye back upon the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times, for it is many Years &s;ince tho&s;e things were done, you will find I have not wrong'd the Memory of the Per&s;on, and that you will be &s;atisfy'd great part of the Account is true in Fact.</P>
<P>Now, I mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech your Wor&s;hip to give your aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in crying down this Unchri&s;tian Practice in all its parts; and let the World know from your Authentick Hand, how ju&s;tly the Vice of <HI>Speech-making</HI> is abhor'd by all hone&s;t Men; but ob&s;erve, if you plea&s;e, that I do not condemn <HI>Speech-making</HI> in general as &s;uch, for that may be very u&s;eful in its place, but making Speeches again&s;t Principles, and again&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Benefactors, on purpo&s;e to appear con|&s;iderable, and to be drawn off again by a frail Argument which I am a&s;ham'd to name.</P>
<P>I know your Wor&s;hip abhors the&s;e Things; and tho' fame lay's it to your Charge, that you &s;pake &s;omewhat after this &s;ort lately, upon the Subject of <HI>Shewing Mercy,</HI> &amp;c. yet as common Fame is a fal&s;e Jilt, and has long &s;ince lo&s;t her Reputation, I a&s;&s;ure your Wor&s;hip, I &s;hall give no credit to her Words in that Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, I cannot entertain a Thought, that you, who under&s;tands what belongs to Humane Mercy &s;o much, having wanted it &s;o often in Ci|vil Affairs, tho' not in Criminal; could open your Mouth, <HI>unle&s;s Paid for it beyond the ordinary Price,</HI> for the &s;hew|ing Mercy to tho&s;e who are no ways the proper objects of Mercy, either of God or Man.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, Sir, what <HI>(I hear)</HI> you very nobly in&s;i&s;ted upon, <HI>(viz.)</HI> How Kings &s;hould imitate the King of Kings, in that Superiour Attribute of &s;hewing Mercy, and how glorious it
<PB N="26" REF="25">
was for Princes to come up to that Sub|lime Pattern: But as our <HI>Jacobites</HI> have enlarged upon that Point to an extreme hight, <HI>higher to be &s;ure than your Wor|&s;hip ever intended it,</HI> I know your Judg|ment mu&s;t joyn with the Kings in this, That it may be his Maje&s;ty's Duty to imitate the Merciful God of Heaven in Forgivne&s;s, but that we no where find, that any King ought to go beyond that Sacred Pattern: <HI>For example,</HI> our Religion teaches us, <HI>That if we confe&s;s, and for|&s;ake, we &s;hall find Mercy;</HI> our Rubrick &s;ays, <HI>Spare thou them, O God, which confe&s;s their Faults.</HI> But neither does God him&s;elf Pardon any, but the Pe|nitent, neither can any Man, but on the highe&s;t Pre&s;umption, &s;o much as Pray for Pardon for him&s;elf, or any one el&s;e, but on the Suppo&s;ition of Re|pentance and Reformation.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>and't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip,</HI> we have not yet heard of one of the&s;e Pri&s;oners, or Condemn'd People that confe&s;s <HI>their Fault;</HI> for your Wor&s;hip knows, there is a va&s;t difference be|tween confe&s;&s;ing <HI>the Fact,</HI> and confe&s;&s;ing <HI>the Fault,</HI> and tho&s;e who would have the King &s;hew Mercy to the fir&s;t, without the la&s;t, are for having the
<PB N="27" REF="26">
King go farther, <HI>your Wor&s;hip knows,</HI> than ever God Almighty him&s;elf went yet.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain therefore, that your Wor&s;hip was for having the King be Merciful to tho&s;e who by a Penitent acknowledgment of their Crime, as well as of the Fact, rendred them&s;elf Objects worthy of Compa&s;&s;ion; for otherwi&s;e it is mo&s;t certain, your Wor&s;hip was for having the King Pardon tho&s;e, who we are &s;ure God him&s;elf will not Pardon.</P>

<P>IT has often been Complain'd of as a Grievance, that our Court have for|merly by Bribery, Pen&s;ions, Preferment, <HI>with other Arts,</HI> form'd their Intere&s;t among their People: But the pre&s;ent Complaint is the rever&s;e of that Practice, <HI>viz.</HI> The Subjects, by a new fa&s;hion'd Method of Chagrin, Raillery, and Di&s;|content, forcing their Intere&s;t in the Publick.</P>
<P>Nothing is more Certain, than that for Fifty Years pa&s;t, this has been the growing Practi&s;e of the Times: It was at fir&s;t, indeed, a <HI>State Secret,</HI> and e&s;teem'd to be a Secret of great value; few un|der&s;tood it; and therefore when we found the Polititians clamorous and loud one Week, and as &s;ilent as Mutes the next, we u&s;ed to be Surpriz'd at it, till old Colonel <HI>Birch,</HI> in the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. broke into it, and di&s;cover'd the Trick. The Ca&s;e was thus,</P>
<P>An Eminent Member had, for &s;ome
<PB N="29" REF="28">
Years, made him&s;elf known by his lead|ing Intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e; He was a Man of Sen&s;e, a Patron of Liberty, warm again&s;t Favourites; had made him&s;elf very popular in Parliament by his Zeal again&s;t the Popi&s;h Plot; con&s;tantly op|pos'd giving Money without redre&s;s of Grievances; a mighty <HI>Habeaus Corpus-Man;</HI> an Enemy to <HI>French</HI> Whores, <HI>French</HI> Coun&s;ellors, &amp;c. And this Warmth continued till the Time that famous Attempt was made in the Hou&s;e, call'd, <HI>The Bill of Exclu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But his Friends were &s;trangely &s;ur|priz'd, when after &s;o long Experience of his Forwardne&s;s, they found on a &s;ud|den, he had not one Word to &s;ay, no not in that popular Cau&s;e, <HI>of the Excluding a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or;</HI> neither did he meet at the Clubs as u&s;ual, where tho&s;e things were ordinarily Concerted: It happen'd once, that upon a Committee, where they were altogether upon that famous Debate, an old Member who &s;at next him, pre&s;s'd him to give his Opinion, but he declin'd it, and the old Member &s;till urging him, <HI>Let him alone,</HI> &s;ays Col. <HI>Birch, he has receiv'd HUSH-MONEY.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Je&s;t took,</HI> the Word became Pro|verbial,
<PB N="30" REF="29">
and it grew very Publick; but for all that, the Court, who found their Account in it, <HI>continued the Practi&s;e:</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who lov'd a good Turn of Wit, made that Word his <HI>Com|mon Place</HI> for the Occa&s;ion; and if they found a trouble&s;om Man begin to lead a Party, and make warm Speeches, &amp;c. it was the Word pre&s;ently at Court, <HI>he mu&s;t have &s;ome</HI> Hu&s;h-Money.</P>
<P>But as this was a Practi&s;e &s;candalous enough upon the Court, and made u&s;e of in a Way mo&s;t particularly mi&s;chievous to the Nation, &s;o when once it became Publick, the Country Gentlemen turn'd the Tables upon the Mini&s;try, and made it <HI>a bite upon the Court;</HI> For as &s;oon as they found that the Court, to cover their De&s;igns, and keep the People Ea&s;ie, were very willing to &s;top the Mouth of every Complainer with <HI>Hu&s;h-Money,</HI> and that to be a <HI>Malecontent</HI> of Note, was a cer|tain Step to advance a Man's Intere&s;t. This <HI>Hu&s;h-Money</HI> became a Plague upon the Court, they turn'd all <HI>Malecontents</HI> on purpo&s;e to be Bought off: Yet &s;uch was the Conduct of that Court, &s;o much were they afraid to let their Practi&s;es be expos'd, and &s;o little were they able to bear a Plain-Dealer, that tho' they knew
<PB N="31" REF="30">
they were Impo&s;ed upon to the la&s;t de|gree, yet they were oblig'd to wink, and let it go on, having no other way to &s;top the Clamours of the People, but to buy off the Complainer; and this grew a dread|ful Rent-Charge upon them at la&s;t; e&s;pe|cially if it be true, as &s;ome have &s;aid, that it co&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Four Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds a Year in <HI>Hu&s;h-Money,</HI> to &s;top the Mouths of <HI>Parliament-Men.</HI></P>
<P>But if this was a Satyr upon the <HI>Court,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee their Pockets pickt, that they might at the &s;ame Time, <HI>by the help of tho&s;e Mercenary Creatures,</HI> get an Opportuni|ty to pick the Nations Pocket of three times as much; Yet it was much more &s;candalous upon the People concern'd, who, by &s;elling them&s;elves to the Go|vernment, dive&s;ted them&s;elves of the Power of &s;erving their Country; and like a Souldier, who in the heat of Action quits his Po&s;t, making a breach in the Line of Battle, at which the Enemy breaks in, and de&s;troys the whole Body, &s;o the&s;e Men made a mon&s;trous Breach in the Con&s;titution, at which <HI>Tyrany, Arbi|trary Government, Per&s;ecution of Prote|&s;tants,</HI> and at la&s;t, <HI>a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or</HI> broke
<PB N="32" REF="31">
in, to the endangering the <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot but be remember'd very well by many, how Merry King <HI>Charles</HI> II, u&s;ed to make him&s;elf with tho&s;e <HI>Hu&s;h-Money-Men; 'Ds Fi&s;h,</HI> &s;ays the King one Day, upon &s;eeing the Account for Se|cret Service, <HI>I believe they'l go Halves with me at la&s;t.</HI> At another Time, when an Eminent Member had made a flameing Speech again&s;t giving more Money, and it was propo&s;ed to get him off, <HI>Vijs et Modis,</HI> as before; <HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>I have heard of Buying and Selling of Places, but I never heard of Buying and Selling of SPEECHES before.</HI> But the King fell out with 'em at la&s;t; for after all they had got of the King, and after all the King had got of the Nation by them, at la&s;t the King would Give no more to Them, and then they would Give no more to Him; upon which they were &s;ent home, Cur&s;t and Expos'd, as they de&s;erv'd; of whom the famous <HI>A. Marvel</HI> has the&s;e two Lines,<Q><L>But thanks to the Wh&mdash; who made the K&mdash; Dogged,</L>
<L>For Giving no more, the Rogues were Prorogued.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
But let us now bring this down to the pre&s;ent Time, that the folly and ab&s;ur|dity of this <HI>Speech-making</HI> may appear; and this indeed is the Rea&s;on of reciting the &s;candalous Hi&s;tory of the Days pa&s;t; What can tho&s;e Gentlemen promi&s;e to them&s;elves? Or what do they propo&s;e? Is there a King now Reigning that wants &s;uch Mercenaries, that fears their Tongues, or can &s;toop to entertain them in His Pay? Sure they cannot have &s;uch &s;candalous Notions in their Minds, of a Government of which them&s;elves have &s;aid &s;o many fine Things before!</P>
<P>Let us examine a little the Circum|&s;tances of their new <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> which have appear'd &s;o lately in a <HI>certain Place,</HI> and whence the Original of their Motion may be drawn: It is evident they are not <HI>Tories;</HI> they are not &s;o either Simply, or by Compo&s;ition; neither Naturally or Politically; the Air they have put upon their Conduct, has &s;o little of Art in it, that even the <HI>Torys</HI> them&s;elves &s;ay, <HI>It has not Di&s;gui&s;e enough in it to do their Cau&s;e any Service, or the</HI> Whigg <HI>Cau&s;e any Harm;</HI> So that it is perfectly Impotent, and &s;erves for no other End, but to ex|po&s;e the People that put it on, and give
<PB N="34" REF="33">
the Hi&s;&s;ing Part of the By-&s;tanders an opportunity to Divert them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But are they <HI>Whiggs</HI> then! Is it po&s;&s;i|ble that <HI>Whiggs</HI> can be found making Speeches for Mercy to Rebells! Who ne|ver yet were Penitent enough to ackno|wledge their ri&s;ing in Arms again&s;t King <HI>George</HI> was a Rebellion! Who &s;trove to obtain their Pardon by a Party Spirit! And make a Faction for Mercy, again&s;t Prudence! Can this be done by a Friend to King <HI>George,</HI> and as &s;uch! It is im|po&s;&s;ible. But if it be True, and the Speakers are <HI>Whiggs,</HI> they mu&s;t either have renounced the Name of <HI>Whigg,</HI> and be what, as <HI>Whiggs,</HI> they always e&s;teem'd Scandalous, nay, Infamous, I mean <HI>Jacobits,</HI> and Friends to <HI>Jacobites;</HI> or it mu&s;t be from &s;ome Private Spirit, &s;ome Parl&mdash;t Policy, &s;uch as &s;elling of Speeches was in former Days, getting <HI>Hu&s;h-Money,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Again, Upon what Principle can any Thing that calls it &s;elf a <HI>Whigg,</HI> or is attach'd to the Intere&s;t of King <HI>George,</HI> oppo&s;e, at &s;uch a Time as this, the pa&s;&s;ing of a Bill, which is the only &s;tep to put an entire End to the Spirit of Rebellion among us, the only thing that
<PB N="35" REF="34">
can entirely extingui&s;h the hopes and expectations of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> by remo|ving that one, and only Difficulty, upon which alone the expectation of reviving the Intere&s;t of Rebellion did depend, whether this be the Affair of <HI>Trienneal</HI> Parliaments, or any other Thing.</P>
<P>Nay, tho' there &s;hould be &s;ome Niceties of Priviledge, or any thing el&s;e, which at another time it would be very rational and commendable to In&s;i&s;t upon; yet is it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ay for a Per&s;on to di&s;|pence with &s;ome Laws which are ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd the <HI>Bulwark</HI> of our <HI>Liberties;</HI> and &s;hall we not di&s;pence with Circum&s;tan|ces? Shall we &s;tand upon Niceties and Punctilios, to the hazard of the whole Nation? Shall we pa&s;s over the Great, and not abate the Small? How &s;trangely Nice mu&s;t the&s;e Men be, and how con|trary to common Prudence do they Act? Do not Men blow up Hou&s;es when the Street is on Fire, to &s;ave the remainder of the Town? Is the Dammage to a few a &s;ufficient Argument to prevent it? Was ever any Man affraid it &s;hould be made a Precedent, to blow up other Peoples Hou&s;es when there is not the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity, or when there was no Fire at all?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">
If a <HI>Tory</HI> had made u&s;e of &s;uch Argu|ments again&s;t the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Bill, or the <HI>Trienneal,</HI> &amp;c. we &s;hould not have thought it &s;trange; but for <HI>Whiggs</HI> to act thus! It mu&s;t be upon &s;ome meaner, lower Principle than tho&s;e <HI>who de&s;erve the Name of Whiggs</HI> always acted from; and altho' the&s;e Sheets &s;hall not under|take to charge any Modern Gentleman with Speaking upon the foot of Mer|cenary Expectations, either within the Hou&s;e, or without it; yet as <HI>Buying</HI> and <HI>Selling</HI> of <HI>Speeches,</HI> receiving of <HI>Hu&s;h-Money,</HI> &amp;c. has been Practices recent in our Memory; and by which the Sove|raign has been abu&s;ed, and the Nation betray'd; 'tis hard to avoid the injection of &s;uch things to our Thoughts, when we are at a lo&s;s to find any other proba|ble Rea&s;on for the extraordinary Mea|&s;ures of &s;ome People, who&s;e Actions and Speeches we could always till now account for.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay then to the&s;e <HI>Speech-makers?</HI> Shall we &s;peak to them as <HI>Whiggs?</HI> Why even in that predica|ment they appear mo&s;t Ridiculous. Let us refer them back to &s;ome of their own Speeches, when they were in their Sen|&s;es, and let them be judges for them|&s;elves,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
after all they have &s;aid of King <HI>George,</HI> of his <HI>&s;tanding by his Friends; doing Ju&s;tice to his Enemies, and fear|ing no body;</HI> let us a&s;k now, whether they can ever believe, that his Maje&s;ty can be capable of any apprehen&s;ion from the pre&s;ent Grimace they put upon their Conduct? And that their Speeches, in Oppo&s;ition to his ju&s;t Mea&s;ures, can have any other Effect upon the King, than to give his Maje&s;ty a needfull Know|ledge of the Men, and a ju&s;t Contempt of their De&s;igns?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their own former Speeches, let them Read Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI>'s Letter to the Pope, and &s;ee there the ju&s;t Character which he gives, not of the Kings Per&s;on only, but of his Admini&s;tration: Let them look over Mr. <HI>L&mdash;mer</HI>'s Speech upon the Impeach|ments, where he is pleas'd to &s;ay, <HI>That the Wi&s;dom and Steddine&s;s of his Ma|je&s;ty's Government, have retriev'd the Honour and Reputation of his Kingdom:</HI> Let the&s;e things &s;peak the Ab&s;urdity and Folly of tho&s;e who, being at the Bottom Embark't &s;olidly, by Principle and Inclination, for the Kings Intere&s;t, can yet be &s;o Mercenary as to put on the Countenance of <HI>Malecontent,</HI> upon the ba&s;e Notions of making them&s;elves
<PB N="38" REF="37">
Nece&s;&s;ary; and this in a Reign too, where they ought to know better than to think it can be made to an&s;wer &s;o mean a De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e People look into the Con|duct of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, and &s;ee whether there is any thing done, or doing, that it is in their Power to expo&s;e; or that the Mini&s;ters are at all in their reach: Let them Remember his Maje&s;ty gives no <HI>Hu&s;h-Money,</HI> there are no Court Pen&s;ions to complain of but what are known, and the Court has cho&s;en to let the World know that &s;ome Men have been rewarded beyond their Merit, rather than to have them think they have had more Rewards than are known.</P>
<P>To what end than do Men, who have &s;har'd &s;o much of the Royal Bounty, turn their Backs upon their Principles? And open their Mouths at their Bene|factors? Is it that they think by this Method to get more, when they are even a&s;ham'd to a&s;k upon any other Foundation? It cannot be! Nothing can be &s;o Ba&s;e! It mu&s;t certainly be that they are Sen&s;ible they have been too well us'd, and can no longer in Con&s;cience
<PB N="39" REF="38">
deceive a Prince of &s;o much Benignity, but like Murderers, who are hurry'd by their own Terrors to di&s;cover them&s;elves, they find them&s;elves nece&s;&s;itated to tell the King he has been mi&s;taken in them; <HI>That</HI> they are of the Number of tho&s;e who no Bounty can bind, nor Favour oblige to be Faithful, unle&s;s they have a continual flux of Supplies, &s;ufficient to gratify the nece&s;&s;ary Avarice of an unbounded Expence, occa&s;ion'd by the Practice of all manner of &s;candalous Vices; <HI>That</HI> they are Servants who will never be Paid, and would be always Receiving; <HI>that</HI> their Services are &s;mall and few, and that it would be very nece&s;&s;ary to let the Nation &s;ee they can go on without &s;uch Men as the&s;e; <HI>That</HI> the Market for long Speeches is over, and that having now expos'd them&s;elves &s;ufficiently, they are grown perfectly U&s;ele&s;s either to one &s;ide or other, and are, <HI>at la&s;t,</HI> arriv'd to that meane&s;t condition a publick Man can ever come to, <HI>(viz.) to be neither Valued or Feared.</HI></P>
