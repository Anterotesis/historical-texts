<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Work being perhaps one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular productions ever offered to the Public, I think it right to give the Reader a &s;hort &s;ketch of what he is going to peru&s;e.&mdash;I have endeavoured to arrange matters in &s;ome degree like a large garden, where one meets with the &s;weet-&s;melling flower and the thorn, the gold-be&s;pangled fly and loath&s;ome rep|tile, the riche&s;t glowing plumage and the darke&s;t &s;hades; the whole &s;o variegated as to afford, I hope, both information and amu&s;ement, without racking or depre&s;&s;ing the &s;pirits, and damping the mind; not indeed in the modern pomp and brilliancy of &s;tyle, but in a &s;imple tale, where TRUTH is the chief or|nament.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">Here, in the different characters of a Commander &mdash;a Rebel Negro&mdash;a Planter, and a Slave&mdash;not only tyranny are expo&s;ed&mdash;but benevolence and humanity are unveiled to the naked eye. Here the Warrior&mdash; the Hi&s;torian&mdash;the Merchant&mdash;and the Lover of Na|tural Philo&s;ophy, will meet with &s;ome gratification; while, for having introduced my private adventures, I mu&s;t make &s;ome apology&mdash;but none for tho&s;e of the <HI>lovely Slave,</HI> who makes not the lea&s;t intere&s;ting figure in the&s;e pages&mdash;as female virtue in di&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially when accompanied with youth and beauty, mu&s;t ever claim protection.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, perhaps, &s;ome allowance may be made, when the Reader con&s;iders he is peru&s;ing no romance compo&s;ed of fiction, but a real hi&s;tory, to|tally unembelli&s;hed with the marvellous;&mdash;the pro|duction of an Officer, who&s;e pen and pencil have alone been employed&mdash;and ON THE SPOT, a circum|&s;tance but very &s;eldom met with.</P>
<P>As to the &s;hocking cruelties that here are &s;o fre|quently expo&s;ed, let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that to deter others from &s;imilar inhuman practices, and teach
<PB N="v" REF="6">
them virtue, was my &s;ole and only motive; while, on the other hand, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that LIBERTY, nay even too much lenity, when <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> granted to illiterate and unprincipled men, mu&s;t be to <HI>all</HI> parties dangerous, if not pernicious. Witne&s;s the <HI>Owca</HI> and <HI>Sarameca</HI> Negroes in Surinam&mdash;the <HI>Maroons</HI> of Ja|maica, the <HI>Carribs</HI> of St. Vincent, &amp;c.</P>
<P>While the Colony of Surinam however is reeking and dyed with the blood of the African negroes, truth compels me to ob&s;erve, that the Dutch there are not the only guilty; but that to mo&s;t other nations, and particularly the Jews, is owing this almo&s;t con|&s;tant and diabolical barbarity.</P>
<P>Reader, peru&s;e the pages annexed with impartiality and with temper&mdash;&s;ort the flowers from the weeds&mdash; divide the gold &s;kilfully from the dro&s;s&mdash;and perhaps you may not regret the hours you have thus dedicated. A few orthographical errors and inaccuracies have been di&s;covered, particularly in the Fir&s;t Volume, from my having unavoidably been prevented from &s;uperintending its progre&s;s while in the pre&s;s: But in a &s;hort Errata, and particularly in the Index,
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
to which I refer the curious, will be found properly &s;pelt the names of men and things.&mdash;Let it however not be under&s;tood, that I ever laid claim to excellence in writing or drawing; but if the plain and MANLY TRUTH, &s;o often &s;poken of, and &s;o &s;eldom found, are of any avail&mdash;I pre&s;ume to hope, that the&s;e Vo|lumes are not entirely unworthy the attention of a BRITISH Public.</P>

<P>THE exploring of foreign countries having of late years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I.</NOTE> and particularly &s;ince the recent di&s;coveries of the immortal CAPTAIN COOK, &s;o generally been the object of per&s;ons both in private and public &s;ituations; and the hi&s;tories of their labours and pur&s;uits being &s;o intere&s;ting to the curio&s;ity of the public, I have ventured to offer &s;uch ob&s;ervations as I have had an opportunity of making in a very &s;ingular part of the globe, on which few Engli&s;hmen have been thrown, either by accident
<PB N="2" REF="23">
or curio&s;ity. The colony of <HI>Surinam,</HI> in Dutch <HI>Guiana,</HI> &s;o far as it is inhabited and cultivated by Europeans near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, has indeed been known for many years pa&s;t. But the deep inundations, with the impenetrable thickne&s;s of the woods, have been &s;uch con&s;tant di&s;cou|ragements and ob&s;tructions to di&s;covery, that but very little <HI>true</HI> information concerning that country has as yet been obtained, except what relates to &s;uch objects of commerce as are common to mo&s;t of the tropical &s;ettle|ments. This publication, therefore, is chiefly intended to particularize &s;uch circum&s;tances and events as the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of penetrating into the interior parts of the coun|try have enabled me to make, and forced on my ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>The feeling part of my readers, I mu&s;t hope, will re|ceive with &s;ome indulgence a work proceeding from an officer, who, from his early youth, was debarred in ac|quiring perfection, either as a writer or a painter, by his military and maritime profe&s;&s;ion. I neverthele&s;s humbly flatter my&s;elf that whatever may be found wanting in &s;tyle and elegance, is in &s;ome degree compen&s;ated by that fidelity and correctne&s;s, which can alone be the work of a pen and pencil employed on the &s;pot. With re&s;pect to a few quaint expre&s;&s;ions, and even oaths, as &s;poken by common <HI>&s;oldiers, &s;ailors,</HI> &amp;c. that &s;ometimes unavoidably occur in the narrative of this wonderful expedition, I mu&s;t humbly reque&s;t the world not to be &s;tartled at them, not only becau&s;e the &s;hades of black and white
<PB N="3" REF="24">
enliven the picture, but becau&s;e I am determined to write <HI>truth</HI> only, and expo&s;e <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>folly</HI> in their native colours.&mdash;Come then, <HI>my friends</HI> &mdash;
<Q><L>"Together let us beat this <HI>ample field,</HI></L>
<L>"Try what the open, what the covert yield;</L>
<L>"The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore</L>
<L>"Of all who blindly creep, or &s;ightle&s;s &s;oar:</L>
<L>"Eye <HI>Nature's walks,</HI> &s;hoot Folly as it flies,</L>
<L>"And catch the manners living as they ri&s;e;</L>
<L>"Laugh where we mu&s;t, be candid where we can;</L>
<L>"But vindicate the ways of God to man."</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I will now boldly launch out on the difficult ta&s;k.&mdash; As the nature, however, of the&s;e tran&s;actions can only be under&s;tood by a reference to the occa&s;ion which call|ed me thither, I feel my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;till premi&s;ing a few words upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Every part of the world, where <HI>dome&s;tic &s;lavery</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed, may be occa&s;ionally liable to in&s;urrection and di&s;quiet, more e&s;pecially where the &s;laves con&s;titute the majority of the inhabitants; but the colony of <HI>Su|rinam,</HI> in Dutch Guiana, has been peculiarly unfortunate in this re&s;pect. Whether from the &s;helter which is af|forded to the fugitives by the immen&s;e fore&s;ts which over&s;pread the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of this country, or whether the government of this &s;ettlement be radically defective, it is a certain fact, that its <HI>European</HI> &s;ettlers
<PB N="4" REF="25">
are con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t violent ravages, and the mo&s;t de&s;perate outrage. Of the&s;e circum&s;tances this is not however the place for a minute detail. Let it &s;uffice therefore for the pre&s;ent, only to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e repeated <HI>revolts</HI> and <HI>in&s;urrections</HI> demanded at length the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures for the re&s;toration of a general peace; and that the accounts tran&s;mitted to Holland, in the year 1772, that a con&s;iderable body of armed people of <HI>this</HI> de&s;cription had a&s;&s;embled in the fore&s;ts, and became extremely formidable to the colony, determined their <HI>High Mightine&s;&s;es</HI> the STATES of the United Provinces to &s;end out a &s;ufficient maritime force to oppo&s;e the in&s;urgents, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to quell the in|&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briti&s;h navy</HI> had ever been my choice and am|bition, in which I was well recommended; but the &s;mall hopes of preferment I had naturally to expect in time of peace, and my paternal e&s;tate being lo&s;t ju&s;t after my birth by accidental misfortunes, induced me to relin|qui&s;h the hopes of advancement in the &s;ea &s;ervice, and to accept an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion, pre&s;ented me without purcha&s;e, in one of the <HI>Scots brigade</HI> regiments in the pay of Holland, where Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph York</HI> (late Lord Dover) at that period was amba&s;&s;ador from the Briti&s;h court; before which nobleman I had the honour to take the u&s;ual oaths of abjuration and allegiance to my KING and COUNTRY, as regi&s;tered at the Briti&s;h war-office.&mdash; This point I have al&s;o thought it right to premi&s;e, as
<PB N="5" REF="26">
a duty owing to my&s;elf, to &s;hew the world in general that it was nece&s;&s;ity not choice that compelled me to enter into a <HI>foreign</HI> &s;ervice; though perhaps a more ancient and di&s;tingui&s;hed corps does not exi&s;t than the above brigade has proved to be, both in this i&s;land and on the continent, for above two hundred years.</P>
<P>At the time of the above in&s;urrection I was Lieutenant in the Honourable General <HI>John Stuart</HI>'s regiment; when, impre&s;&s;ed by the hopes of traver&s;ing the &s;ea, my favou|rite element, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure gratifying my curio|&s;ity, in exploring a part of the world not generally known; &s;till more by the pro&s;pect of that preferment which might be con&s;equent on &s;o dangerous an expedi|tion; I in&s;tantly &s;olicited admi&s;&s;ion into a corps of volun|teers which was preparing to &s;ail for Guiana, and had the honour, by his <HI>Serene Highne&s;s</HI> WILLIAM V. PRINCE OF ORANGE, to be advanced to the rank of Captain by brevet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Each officer was permitted to re-enter his former regiment, if he &s;urvived the expedition, and returned to Europe, a vacancy being there pre&s;erved for him during his ab&s;ence.</NOTE>, under Colonel <HI>Lou&iuml;s Henry Four|geoud,</HI> a Swi&s;s gentleman, from the Alpine Mountains, who was appointed our commander in chief.</P>
<P>Having taken the oaths of fidelity on the 12th of No|vember to the new corps, and prepared what was nece&s;|&s;ary for the voyage, I bade farewell to my old regi|ment, and immediately &s;ailed to the i&s;land of <HI>Texel,</HI> where &s;everal of our gentlemen were already a&s;&s;embled;
<PB N="6" REF="27">
and where, on going a&s;hore, I had nearly peri&s;hed by the boat's &s;hipping a &s;ea, and &s;inking in the &s;urf.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of <HI>Wieringen</HI> was however the &s;pot of general rendezvous: here Colonel Fourgeoud arriving on the 7th of December, the volunteers were all a&s;&s;em|bled, to the number of five hundred fine young men; and on the morning of the 8th we were formed into &s;even companies, and embodied as a regiment of marines. Be&s;ides the <HI>Boreas</HI> and <HI>We&s;tellingwerf</HI> men-of-war, com|manded by Captains <HI>Van de Velde</HI> and <HI>Cra&s;s,</HI> three new frigate-built tran&s;ports were put in commi&s;&s;ion, carrying en&s;ign, jack, and pennant, and armed with from ten to &s;ixteen guns, as &s;loops of war; on board the&s;e ve&s;&s;els we embarked the &s;ame afternoon under a general &s;alute, then took the command, and did the duty as in the navy.</P>
<P>Our departure was not however immediately con&s;e|quent on our embarkation. We lay wind-bound in the Texel roads for many days, during which time one of our young officers, a Mr. <HI>He&s;&s;eling,</HI> was unfortunately &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox: this gentleman, in order to pre|vent his infecting the &s;hip's company, was ordered on &s;hore to a town on the land's end, called the <HI>Helder,</HI> where I conducted him in a pinnace, and where we left him behind us; but on my return, the &s;urgeon declaring he &s;aw the &s;ymptoms of the &s;ame di&s;order on my&s;elf, I was al&s;o immediately ordered to the i&s;land of Texel. Hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t anxious quarantine in this place, I had
<PB N="7" REF="28">
the good fortune however to e&s;cape the loath&s;ome ma|lady, and to the Doctor's &s;urprize appeared once more on board perfectly well, ju&s;t before the &s;ignal gun was fired for the fleet to weigh anchor. This circum&s;tance cannot but induce me to wi&s;h that tho&s;e in particular who are de&s;tined for a military or a naval life would avail them&s;elves of the art of inoculation, in order to avoid a painful anxiety to them&s;elves, and a mo&s;t dan|gerous infection to their fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>On Chri&s;tmas-day our &s;mall fleet put to &s;ea, at eight o'clock, A. M. with a fre&s;h breeze from E. N. E. in com|pany with above one hundred ve&s;&s;els bound for differ|ent parts of the globe, and the mo&s;t beautiful clear wea|ther. Having &s;afely got without the &s;oundings, and &s;aluted each other with nine guns, we kept our cour&s;e down channel, and &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>North Foreland,</HI> the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> and <HI>Portland Point</HI>; but here the We&s;t|ellingwerf, having &s;prung a leak, was obliged to part company, and run into <HI>Plymouth</HI> for repair.</P>
<P>The wind now fre&s;hened as we approached the <HI>Bay of Bi&s;cay,</HI> where the mate of the ve&s;&s;el directed my particular attention to a kind of &s;ea-&s;wallow, commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>Storm-bird</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Stormy Petrel</HI> of Pennant.</NOTE>, from its &s;uppo&s;ed pro|perty of foretelling an impending tempe&s;t. The colour of this bird is a very deep blue approaching to black, and enlivened by &s;ome variegated tints; its &s;ize is about
<PB N="8" REF="29">
that of a large martin or &s;wallow; it is web-footed; the bill is very long and &s;harp, and the wings of an extraor|dinary length, which enable it to fly very fa&s;t, and for a con&s;iderable time, &s;kimming with incredible velocity around the horizon: it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts entirely upon fi&s;h, which is probably the cau&s;e of its being &s;en&s;ible of the fir&s;t in|dications of whatever may prevent its u&s;ual &s;upply of food: it then flies along with extreme &s;wiftne&s;s, in order to avoid the &s;torm; but if overtaken by it, drops its wings, and floats upon the &s;urface of the waves.</P>
<P>On the following day, January 2d, 1773, the predic|tions of the &s;torm-bird were verified: a heavy gale &s;prung up from N. N. E. by which, off <HI>Cape Fini&s;terre,</HI> the Boreas and Vigilance were &s;eparated from us. We kept our cour&s;e during the night with double reefed top|&s;ails, and all the hatches laid, which made our men in general very &s;ick. Here I ought not to forget that by way of experiment we had &s;lung the hammocks <HI>athwart</HI> &s;hips, and not as u&s;ual fore and aft; which method we found however to be both &s;o roomy and convenient, that it has been &s;ince adopted by &s;everal other ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 4th we &s;pied a &s;tout &s;hip to windward in the offing, bearing &s;treight down upon us. Conjecturing &s;he might be an <HI>Algerine pirate</HI> from the African coa&s;t, and now but two &s;hips out of five, we prepared to engage her; &s;he however &s;oon proved to be the Boreas man-of-war, which had parted company on the 2d. From this date the men were daily exerci&s;ed at
<PB N="9" REF="30">
the great guns, and by firing at a target &s;u&s;pended from the yard-arm.</P>
<P>On the 14th, in the morning-watch, we pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tro|pic,</HI> when the u&s;ual ceremony of ducking the fre&s;h-water &s;ailors was ran&s;omed by tipping the forema&s;t men with &s;ome &s;ilver. About this time the Boreas mo&s;t unluckily lo&s;t one of her be&s;t &s;eamen, the boat&s;wain's mate, who&s;e hand &s;lipping by the wet, he pitched from the fore-yard-arm into the &s;ea. His pre&s;ence of mind in calling to the captain, as he floated along&s;ide,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">Be not alarmed for me, &s;ir,"</Q>
in the confidence of meeting with relief, at|tracted peculiar compa&s;&s;ion, and even cau&s;ed &s;ome mur|muring, as no a&s;&s;i&s;tance was offered him; in con&s;equence of which, after &s;wimming a con&s;iderable time within view, the unfortunate young man went to the bottom.</P>
<P>We now were got in the tract of the <HI>trade winds,</HI> which blowing continually ea&s;t, and the weather becoming from day to day more temperate, made the voyage exceedingly plea&s;ant; more &s;o by the many <HI>dolphins</HI> or <HI>dorados,</HI> which beautiful fi&s;h &s;eem to take peculiar delight in &s;porting around the ve&s;&s;els. The <HI>real</HI> dolphin, which is of the cetaceous kind, was <HI>anciently</HI> celebrated in poetic &s;tory on account of its philanthropy and other &s;uppo&s;ed vir|tues: but to the dorado or dolphin of the <HI>moderns,</HI> this character is far from being applicable, this fi&s;h being ex|tremely voracious and de&s;tructive, and is known to fol|low the &s;hips, and exhibit his &s;ports and gambols, not from attachment to mankind, but from the more &s;elfi&s;h
<PB N="10" REF="31">
motive of procuring food, particularly on the eve of an approaching &s;torm, of which he appears perfectly &s;en|&s;ible. The circum&s;tance which chiefly entitles the do|rado to our attention is, the unrivalled and dazzling bril|liancy of its colours in the water, the whole of its back being enamelled with &s;pots between azure blue and a reflecting light &s;ea-green, on a very dark ground, which appears as be&s;pangled all over with jewels, and forms a mo&s;t beautiful contra&s;t to the belly, which is of a whiti&s;h ca&s;t; the fins and tail are of a golden dye: the length of this animal is from five to &s;ix feet, and its form tapers from the head towards the tail, which is divided, and terminates not unlike the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent. The head is round, and preceded by a kind of &s;nout; the jaws are armed with &s;everal &s;harp teeth, and the eyes are remarkably large. The &s;cales of the dorado are uncom|monly &s;mall, and it is furni&s;hed with a fin, which runs along its back from the one extremity to the other.</P>
<P>Our progre&s;s was now daily marked by increa&s;ing warm weather, which relea&s;ed me from the confinement of a di&s;agreeable cabin crowded with officers, mo&s;t of whom had never been to &s;ea, and enabled me to pur&s;ue my favourite amu&s;ements, whether of reading above deck, or exerci&s;e in the rigging. Thus circum&s;tanced I, on the 17th, had the happine&s;s of rendering a mo&s;t important &s;ervice to one of our young officers, a Mr. <HI>du Moulin,</HI> who by a &s;udden roll of the ve&s;&s;el was actually thrown over the gunwale; at that moment happening to &s;tand

<PB N="11" REF="33">
without-board in the main-chains, I fortunately gra&s;ped hold of him in his fall, which &s;aved him, as he could not &s;wim, from inevitable death.</P>
<P>The entrance into warmer regions gave occa&s;ion to an ob&s;ervation perhaps not generally known, which (though uncouth) mu&s;t be of great importance to &s;ai|lors; namely, that between the Tropics, while vermin may remain in the head, none can po&s;&s;ibly continue to exi&s;t in the bedding, cloaths, linen, &amp;c. Having humbly apologized for the above remark to my delicate readers, I will endeavour to de&s;cribe a curious ani|mal with which the&s;e &s;eas abound, and which appears to &s;ail on the &s;urface of the waves with a &s;ide-wind, while by the &s;ailors it is vulgarly called a Portugue&s;e man-of-war, and is probably either the <HI>Nautilus</HI> or the <HI>Argonauta</HI> of Linnaeus. This wonderful creature, when above water, a&s;&s;umes the &s;hape of an expanded fan, de|corated with a beautiful red border, while the lower ex|tremity is fixed to a &s;hell as thin as paper, or rather a kind of boat, which is &s;unk below or rai&s;ed above the &s;urface of the &s;ea, and guided in any direction, at the plea&s;ure of the animal, by means of &s;ix <HI>tentacula</HI> or limbs, which it u&s;es as oars. When the&s;e creatures are touched by the hand, they occa&s;ion, like the &s;ea blubber or jelly fi&s;h, a painful tinkling &s;en&s;ation, which continues for &s;everal minutes.</P>
<P>The two following days it blew very fre&s;h, and heavy &s;eas wa&s;hed over the ve&s;&s;el; during which, while helping to put a reef in the main-top-&s;ail for a little exerci&s;e, I lo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="34">
every one of my keys, which dropped from the yard|arm into the &s;ea. This trifling accident I &s;hould never have related, had it not proved a very great inconvenience, by debarring me from coming at my private property, particularly &s;ince the whole &s;hip's company, <HI>officers</HI> in|cluded, lived on <HI>&s;alt provi&s;ion</HI> alone, a pig and a couple of lean &s;heep excepted, who&s;e legs had been broken by the rolling and pitching of the ve&s;&s;el. This manner of living on &s;alt-beef, pork, and peas, like common &s;ailors, was introduced by our commander in chief, in order to enure us (he &s;aid) to &s;uch food as we were likely to be alone &s;upplied with in the woods of Surinam; and from the <HI>generous</HI> motive of regaling his American friends with European refre&s;hments&mdash;&s;uch as live &s;heep, hogs, fowls, ducks, bacon hams, bullocks tongues, pre|&s;erved vegetables, pickles, &s;pices, &amp;c. all of which were provided by the town of Am&s;terdam in profu&s;ion. But good intentions do not always meet with their rewards; &s;ince the <HI>worms,</HI> without any one's permi&s;&s;ion, laid hold of the greate&s;t part of the dead &s;tock for them&s;elves; who were, for a puni&s;hment, together with their plunder, thrown overboard into the ocean. Let me add, that in|&s;tead of plate, our meals were frequently &s;erved up in &s;mall wooden tubs of not the mo&s;t cleanly appearance, and only once a day; which negligence, however, I am willing to impute to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Laurant,</HI> the colonel's French valet-de-chambre. In &s;hort, the &s;curvy and other loath&s;ome di&s;orders began to make their appear|ance; dejection and low-&s;pirits took place throughout the
<PB N="13" REF="35">
&s;hip, while I complained <HI>aloud,</HI> and from that moment date the <HI>good-will</HI> which Colonel Fourgeoud manife&s;ted towards me in particular, as will be &s;een throughout the expedition. It is with pain that I relate this pa&s;&s;age&mdash; but no con&s;ideration &s;hall prevent me from bringing to light particular foibles, as it will ever give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to render virtue con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>About the 20th of January, we ob&s;erved great num|bers of flying fi&s;h, the <HI>excoctus volitans</HI> of Linnaeus, which is about the &s;ize of a herring. The back of this animal is flat, and of an olive-brown colour; the &s;ides and belly of a re&s;plendent &s;ilvery white; the mouth &s;mall; the eyes large; the tail bifurcated; and the &s;cales hard, &s;mooth, and &s;ilvery. Upon occa&s;ion the pectoral fins are u&s;ed as wings by this fi&s;h, yet no longer than while they continue wet, for as &s;oon as the moi&s;ture is dried, the animal drops back into the &s;ea. The &s;urface of the&s;e fins is of a golden hue, beautifully variegated near the edges with &s;pots of azure blue: their length is equal to that of the body of the fi&s;h; and its flight, which is undertaken in order to avoid the pur&s;uit of the do|rado, and other large fi&s;h, is always &s;traight forward, and of &s;hort duration, on account of the nece&s;&s;ity of repeatedly wetting its wings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have never &s;een this nece&s;&s;ity pro|perly accounted for: probably the mucus which covers the fins or wings may be|come &s;o con&s;olidated by the heat of the &s;un, and the action of the air, that it may impede their motion; or it may be that the fi&s;h it&s;elf cannot endure to be long out of its proper element: either of the&s;e &s;up|po&s;itions will account for its dropping &s;o often as it were <HI>involuntarily</HI> on board &s;hips, and into the mouth of its enemies, the dolphin, dorado, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The&s;e animals are fre|quently
<PB N="14" REF="36">
found on board ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ticking in the &s;hrouds, which is probably to be a&s;cribed, not, accord|ing to the opinion of &s;ome, to their &s;eeking a refuge there from the attacks of fi&s;h or &s;ea-birds, but &s;imply to their flight being ob&s;tructed by an object, which, as they always fly in a direct line, they have not the power to avoid. The fate of this animal &s;eems peculiarly &s;evere, as it is the prey both of the &s;caly and feathered creation, and frequently meets its doom in that element to which but a moment before it had committed it&s;elf for protec|tion.</P>
<P>Becoming extremely low-&s;pirited towards the clo&s;e of our voyage, I now had recour&s;e to daily &s;ea-bathing, and to a chearing gla&s;s of claret, two ankers of which had been provided for each officer, independantly of his own &s;tock. The&s;e means proved efficacious, and I found my|&s;elf in a few days perfectly recovered from my com|plaint. On the 30th the weather became hazy, when the &s;hips brought-to and hove the lead in thirteen fathom foul water. The following day we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal large black rocks to windward, called <HI>the Con&s;tables,</HI> and ca&s;t anchor near the <HI>Euripice,</HI> or <HI>Devil's I&s;lands,</HI> off the coa&s;t of South America. The Euripice I&s;lands are &s;ituated about twenty-four miles from the French &s;ettlement of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> bearing N. N. W. in north latitude, five de|grees twenty minutes, and con&s;i&s;t of a ridge of &s;mall un|inhabited and very dangerous rocks for &s;hipping. Here the current runs con&s;tantly from the S. E. to the N. W. at the rate of &s;ixty Engli&s;h miles in twenty-four hours;

con&s;equently every ve&s;&s;el which happens to pa&s;s the mouth of the river Surinam mu&s;t make a con&s;iderable circuit in order to regain the po&s;&s;ibility of entering that river.</P>
<P>While we remained in this &s;ituation, we ob&s;erved the <HI>narwhal,</HI> or &s;ea-unicorn, and one or two large turtles, floating pa&s;t the &s;hip's &s;ide. The former of the&s;e is a large fi&s;h, and very di&s;tingui&s;hable by a long &s;piral ex|cre&s;cence on its no&s;e, like a tapering twi&s;ted rope. The one we &s;aw at this time (though &s;ome are &s;aid to be forty or fifty) appeared but &s;ix or eight feet in length, and its horn about four, which weapon is dreadfully offen&s;ive to many fi&s;hes, e&s;pecially to the whale; and when poli&s;hed (either in hardne&s;s or whitene&s;s) is con&s;idered not to be inferior to ivory. The narwhal, which is of the ceta|ceous kind, and con&s;equently viviparous, is more fre|quently found in cold than warm climates. The female is &s;aid to be unprovided with that protuberance &s;o re|markable in the male. It appears that &s;ome authors have confounded this animal with the <HI>&s;word-fi&s;h,</HI> to which however it does not prove to have the very &s;malle&s;t re|&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Another animal, which is called the <HI>&s;aw-fi&s;h,</HI> carries al&s;o an offen&s;ive weapon. The projecting bone of this is three or four feet long, flat, and both &s;ides armed with &s;trong &s;harp-pointed &s;pikes, which give it &s;omewhat the form of a &s;aw; this &s;aw, which is covered over with the &s;ame rough, &s;limy, darki&s;h-coloured &s;kin that covers
<PB N="12" REF="38">
the whole animal, begins to &s;pread it&s;elf near the eyes, and thus continues &s;preading till it forms the head of a flatti&s;h triangular appearance, clo&s;e to which are the two pectoral fins. Above the eyes are two large holes, which I apprehend to be the organs of hearing, and not, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, intended by nature for the purpo&s;e of &s;pouting water. Almo&s;t directly under them is the mouth, which is &s;omething in the form of an half-moon, apparently without teeth, and between that and the under part of the &s;piked &s;aw are the no&s;trils. The body of the &s;aw-fi&s;h is not much larger than the head, with two &s;trong dor&s;al fins, the one near the middle, the other near the tail, which is partly bifurcated, and rai&s;ed perpendicular, the large&s;t part upwards, without rays. The back is co|vered over with a dark &s;limy &s;kin; the whole forming a very hideous appearance. This fi&s;h fights with the large&s;t whales, till the &s;ea all around is died with blood, &s;eldom quitting its adver&s;ary till it has vanqui&s;hed and killed it. I have &s;een this mon&s;ter out of the water, and its whole length mea&s;ured about fourteen feet.</P>
<P>The turtles are divided into two &s;pecies, and are gene|rally di&s;tingui&s;hed in Surinam by the names of <HI>calapee</HI> or green turtle, and <HI>carett.</HI> The former of the&s;e &s;ometimes weighs four hundred pounds, and has a flatti&s;h &s;hell; but the carett is inferior both in &s;ize and quality, except with re&s;pect to its &s;hell, which is more valuable, and of a more convex form. Both the calapee and carett depo&s;it their eggs, which are very excellent food, in the &s;and,

where they are hatched by the heat of the &s;un. The manner of taking the&s;e animals is by turning them on their backs with a hand-&s;pike when they are di&s;covered on &s;hore, and leaving them in this &s;ituation till a conve|nient opportunity occurs for carrying them away; for &s;uch is the heavine&s;s of their &s;tructure, or &s;o languid are their powers, that they are utterly unable to turn them|&s;elves, and effect their e&s;cape. They are publickly expo&s;ed to &s;ale by the butchers in Surinam, like the &s;hambles meat in the European markets, and are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t de|licate food between the months of February and May.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 1&s;t of February we now once more went under way, and kept cour&s;e in &s;hore till the evening, when we came to an anchor off the mouth of the river <HI>Marawina</HI>; this river has occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of many &s;hips, by &s;eamen fatally mi&s;taking it for the river Surinam, to which its entry bears indeed a very great re|&s;emblance. What renders the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;o dangerous, are the numerous rocks, &s;mall i&s;lands, and quick-&s;ands with which it is crouded; be&s;ides its being &s;o &s;hallow at high-water mark (and even with &s;pring-tides) that all &s;hips of any con&s;iderable burthen immediately run a-ground, and go to pieces.</P>
<P>On the 2d, having got our anchor a-peak by day|break, we again &s;et &s;ail, keeping cour&s;e along the coa&s;t; when having doubled <HI>Braam's Point</HI> with a light breeze, under top and top-gallant &s;ails, we finally entered the beautiful river Surinam; and at three o'clock, P. M. dropped anchor before the new fortre&s;s called <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI>;

and here we were extremely happy to meet with our friends in the Vigilance, which ve&s;&s;el (as I have mentioned) had parted company with us in a gale of wind on the 2d of January, off Cape Fini&s;terre, and arrived two days before us in this river.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips crews now were in the highe&s;t flow of &s;pi|rits, &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t delightful verdure, while the river &s;eemed alive by the many boats and barges pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing to &s;ee us, while groups of naked boys and girls were promi&s;cuou&s;ly playing and flouncing, like &s;o many <HI>Tritons</HI> and <HI>Mermaids,</HI> in the water. The &s;cene was new to all, and nothing was heard but mu&s;ic, &s;inging, and cheering on deck, as well as in the rigging, from the ideas of happine&s;s which each individual now promi&s;ed him&s;elf in this luxuriant flouri&s;hing &s;pot, while between decks the heat was be|come in&s;upportable: but how mi&s;erably the&s;e poor fel|lows were mi&s;taken in their reckoning &s;hall &s;oon be &s;een.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t indeed acknowledge that nothing could equal the delicious &s;en&s;ations with which we &s;eemed intoxi|cated by the fragrance of the lemons, limes, oranges, and flowers, wafted over from the adjoining plantations that line the banks of all the rivers in this ever|blooming &s;ettlement, and of which charming fruit, &amp;c. large clu&s;ters were &s;ent on board our &s;hips by Colonel <HI>de Ponchera</HI> of the colonial troops; this gentleman, being the commandant of Fort Am&s;terdam, al&s;o &s;aluted the ve&s;&s;els with nine guns from the batteries, while with an equal number we returned him the compli|ment

from the &s;hips. A long-boat, with one of our captains, was afterwards di&s;patched to Paramaribo, to an|nounce to the governor the arrival of the troops in the colony.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay in this place the companies frequently walked on &s;hore, and I accompanied them in their ex|cur&s;ions; but the plea&s;ure I had flattered my&s;elf with, from exchanging the confinement of a &s;hip for the li|berty of ranging over a delicious country, was damped by the fir&s;t object which pre&s;ented it&s;elf after my land|ing. This was a young female &s;lave, who&s;e only co|vering was a rag tied round her loins, which, like her &s;kin, was lacerated in &s;everal places by the &s;troke of the whip. The crime which had been committed by this mi&s;erable victim of tyranny, was the non-performance of a ta&s;k to which &s;he was apparently unequal, for which &s;he was &s;entenced to receive two hundred la&s;hes, and to drag, during &s;ome months, a chain &s;everal yards in length, one end of which was locked round her ancle, and to the other was affixed a weight of at lea&s;t a hun|dred pounds. Strongly affected with this &s;hocking cir|cum&s;tance, I took a draft of the unhappy &s;ufferer, and re|tained a dreadful idea of the inhumanity of the planters towards the&s;e mi&s;erable &s;ubjects to their power.</P>
<P>The gra&s;s in this part of the country was very long and coar&s;e, and afforded a harbour to two &s;pecies of very di&s;agreeable in&s;ects, termed <HI>Pattat</HI> and <HI>Sorapat</HI> lice by the coloni&s;ts, which &s;ettled on every part of our per&s;ons.
<PB N="16" REF="44">

The&s;e in&s;ects abound mo&s;t during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, when the be&s;t means of avoiding their attacks is &s;uppo&s;ed to be by walking bare|foot, as they are believed to fa&s;ten more ea&s;ily, and con|&s;equently in greater numbers, upon the cloaths, whence however they very &s;peedily find their way to the &s;kin. We did not get rid of our di&s;agreeable companions till our return to the &s;hip, when we wa&s;hed the affected parts with the juice of limes or lemons, which con&s;iderably al|leviated our trouble&s;ome &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>On the 3d of March we received a vi&s;it from &s;everal officers of the Society, or We&s;t India Company's troops, accompanied by a number of other gentlemen, to wel|come our arrival in the colony. Nor were they &s;atisfied with paying us merely a compliment in words, but re|galed us with a large quantity of excellent fruits and other refre&s;hments. They came in very elegant barges or tent-boats, adorned with flags, and attended by &s;mall bands of mu&s;ic. The ve&s;&s;els were rowed by &s;ix or eight negroes, who were entirely without cloaths, except a &s;mall &s;tripe of check or other linen cloth, which was pa&s;&s;ed between their thighs, and fa&s;tened before and be|hind to a thin cotton &s;tring tied round their loins. As the coloni&s;ts generally make choice of their hand&s;ome&s;t &s;laves for this office, and to attend them at table, &amp;c.
<PB N="17" REF="45">
the rowers, who were healthy, young, and vigorous, look|ed extremely well, and their being naked gave us a full opportunity of ob&s;erving their &s;kin, which was &s;hining, and nearly as black as ebony. This &s;cene was however contra&s;ted by the arrival of two canoes filled with emaci|ated &s;tarving wretches, who clamorou&s;ly &s;olicited relief from the &s;oldiers, and were ready to fight for the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a bone.</P>
<P>The day following our Commander in Chief was vi|&s;ited by a Mr. Ryn&s;dorp, who introduced to him two <HI>black &s;oldiers,</HI> manumized &s;laves, who compo&s;ed part of a corps of three hundred which had been lately formed. The&s;e men were exhibited by Mr. Ryn&s;dorp as &s;pecimens of that valiant body, which but a &s;hort time before had mo&s;t gallantly di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf by the protection it had afforded to the colony.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we &s;till remained at anchor before the fortre&s;s Am&s;terdam, I received a polite invitation from one Mr. <HI>Lolkens,</HI> a planter, to whom I had been recommended, to accept the u&s;e of his hou&s;e and table on our arrival at Paramaribo, the capital of the colony.</P>
<P>On the 8th we once more went under way, and after the u&s;ual ceremonies on both &s;ides on leaving the fortre&s;s, &s;ail'd up the river Surinam with drums beating, colours flying, and a guard of marines drawn up on the quarter|deck of each ve&s;&s;el. Having at length reached Parama|ribo, we finally came to an anchor within pi&s;tol-&s;hot off the &s;hore, receiving a &s;alute of eleven guns from the cita|del Zealandia, which was returned by all the &s;hips of our &s;mall fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="46">After being confined nearly the whole of &s;ixty-three days within the limits of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and upon an ele|ment to which few of the troops had been accu&s;tomed, it would not be ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the plea&s;ure we experienced on finding our&s;elves once more on land, and &s;urrounded by a thou&s;and agreeable circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The town appeared uncommonly neat and plea&s;ing, the &s;hipping extremely beautiful, the adjacent woods adorned with the mo&s;t luxuriant verdure, the air per|fumed with the utmo&s;t fragrance, and the whole &s;cene gilded by the rays of an unclouded &s;un. We did not however take leave of our wooden habitation at this time, but the next day were formally di&s;embarked with a ge|neral appearance of rejoicing; all the &s;hips in the roads being in full dre&s;s, and the guns keeping up an ince&s;&s;ant fire till the whole of the troops were landed.</P>
<P>All the inhabitants of Paramaribo were collected to be|hold this &s;plendid &s;cene, nor were the expectations they had formed di&s;appointed. The corps con&s;i&s;ted of nearly five hundred young men; (for we had been &s;o fortunate as only to lo&s;e one during the voyage) the olde&s;t of whom was &s;carcely more than thirty, and the whole party neatly cloathed in their new uniforms, and in caps ornamented with twigs of orange-blo&s;&s;om. We paraded on a large green plain between the town and the citadel, oppo|&s;ite to the Governor's palace; during the cour&s;e of which ceremonies &s;everal &s;oldiers fainted from the exce&s;&s;ive heat. The troops then marched into quarters prepared for their reception, whil&s;t the officers were regaled with a dinner by the Governor, which would have derived a

con&s;iderable reli&s;h from its &s;ucceeding the &s;alt provi&s;ions, to which we had &s;o long been confined, had any contra&s;t been nece&s;&s;ary to heighten our opinion of its elegance. But the choice&s;t delicacies of America and Europe were united in this repa&s;t, and &s;erved up in &s;ilver. A great variety of the riche&s;t wines were poured out with pro|fu&s;ion; the de&s;ert was compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t delicious fruits, and the company were attended by a con&s;iderable number of extremely hand&s;ome negro and mulatto maids, all naked from the wai&s;t upwards, according to the cu&s;tom of the country; but the other parts of their per|&s;ons arrayed in the fine&s;t India chintzes, and the whole adorned with golden chains, medals, beads, bracelets, and &s;weet-&s;melling flowers.</P>
<P>After partaking of this &s;uperb entertainment till about &s;even o'clock, I &s;et out in &s;earch of the hou&s;e of Mr. Lol|kens, the ho&s;pitable gentleman who had &s;o obligingly in|vited me to make it my own. I &s;oon di&s;covered the place, but my reception was &s;o ludicrous that I cannot forbear re|lating the particulars. On knocking at the door, it was open|ed by a young female negro, of a ma&s;culine appearance, who&s;e whole dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ingle petticoat, and who held a lighted tobacco-pipe in one hand, and a burning candle in the other, which &s;he brought clo&s;e to my face, in order to reconnoitre me. I enquired if her ma&s;ter was at home, to which &s;he replied, but in a language totally unintelligible to me. I then mentioned his name, on which &s;he bur&s;t into an immoderate fit of laughter,
<PB N="20" REF="48">
di&s;playing two rows of very beautiful teeth; and at the &s;ame time, laying hold of the brea&s;t-buttons of my coat, &s;he made me a &s;ignal to follow her. I was much at a lo&s;s how to act, but went in, and was u&s;hered by the girl into a very neat apartment, whither &s;he brought &s;ome excellent fruit, and a bottle of Madeira wine, which &s;he placed upon the table. She then, in the be&s;t manner &s;he was able, informed me that her <HI>ma&s;era,</HI> with the re&s;t of his family, was gone to &s;pend a few days at his plantation, and that &s;he was left behind to receive an Engli&s;h Captain, whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be me. I &s;igni|fied that I was, and filled her out a tumbler of wine, which I had the utmo&s;t difficulty to per&s;uade her to ac|cept; for &s;uch is the degrading light in which the&s;e un|happy beings are con&s;idered, that it is accounted a high degree of pre&s;umption in them to eat or drink in the pre&s;ence of an European. I contrived for &s;ome time to carry on &s;omething like a conver&s;ation with this woman, but was &s;oon glad to put an end to it by recurring to my bottle.</P>
<P>Tired with the employments of the day, I longed for &s;ome re&s;t, and made a &s;ignal to my attendant that I wanted to &s;leep: but my motion was &s;trangely mi&s;con|&s;trued; for &s;he immediately &s;eized me by the neck, and imprinted on my lips a mo&s;t ardent ki&s;s. Heartily provoked at this unexpected, and (from one of her co|lour) unwelcome &s;alutation, I di&s;entangled my&s;elf from her embraces, and angrily flung into the apartment allotted
<PB N="21" REF="49">
for my place of re&s;t. But here I was again pur&s;ued by my black tormentor, who, in oppo&s;ition to all I could &s;ay, in&s;i&s;ted upon pulling off my &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and in a moment di&s;encumbered me of that part of my apparel. I was extremely chagrined at her conduct, though this is an office commonly performed by the &s;laves in Suri|nam to all ranks and &s;exes without exception. Nor ought any one to conceive that this apparently extraordi|nary conduct re&s;ulted from any peculiarity of di&s;po&s;ition in the girl; her behaviour was only &s;uch as would have been practi&s;ed by the generality of female negro &s;laves, and what will be found, by all who vi&s;it the We&s;t India &s;ettlements, to be characteri&s;tic of the whole dark &s;i&s;ter|hood.</P>
<P>Finding in the morning that my friend the planter was not returned, I took leave of his man&s;ion, and very ho&s;pitable &s;ervant; and after vi&s;iting the &s;oldiers in their new abodes, was conducted by the quarter-ma&s;ter to a neat habitation appropriated to my u&s;e. I found the hou&s;e entirely unfurni&s;hed, though not de&s;titute of in|habitants; for, leaving my Captain's commi&s;&s;ion, which was of parchment, in the window, the fir&s;t night, I had the mortification to find in the morning that it was de|voured by the rats.</P>
<P>Having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my habitation, my next wi&s;h was to furni&s;h it properly; but all cares of this nature were rendered unnece&s;&s;ary by the generous ho&s;pitality of the inhabitants; the ladies &s;upplied me with tables, chairs,

gla&s;&s;es, and even plate and china, in great abundance; and the gentlemen loaded me with pre&s;ents of Madeira wine, porter, cyder, rum and &s;ugar, be&s;ides a quantity of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fruits. Among&s;t the latter I was particularly &s;truck with the &s;haddock and awara; the former of the&s;e, which is of a very agreeable flavour, between a &s;weet and an acid, is produced from a tree &s;uppo&s;ed to be tran&s;planted from the coa&s;t of Guinea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>&mdash; Exotic of Cerean dye,</L>

<P>The <HI>awara,</HI> or avoira, which is le&s;s remarkable for the excellence of its flavour than its beautiful appear|ance, grows upon a &s;pecies of palm-tree, and is of an oval form, about the &s;ize of an Orlean plumb, and of a rich deep orange colour, nearly approaching to red.

<P>This day, on examining into the &s;tate of our remain|ing live &s;tock, &s;uch as hogs, &s;heep, ducks, gee&s;e, fowls, and turkies, we found them nearly as many in number as when we fir&s;t &s;ailed from Holland: the&s;e were all &s;ent to the colonel's poultry-yard at the head-quarters, while we had the additional mortification of &s;eeing above &s;ixty large kegs with pre&s;erved vegetables, &amp;c. and ju&s;t as many fine We&s;tphalia hams (being perfectly rotten) thrown into the river Surinam to feed the &s;harks.</P>
<P>I now ob&s;erved, on the &s;econd morning after our land|ing, that my face, my brea&s;t, and hands were entirely &s;potted over like the &s;kin of a leopard, occa&s;ioned by myriads of <HI>gnats</HI> or <HI>mu&s;quitoes,</HI> which flying in clouds, had kept me company during the night, though the fa|tigue from my voyage, and the oppre&s;&s;ive heat of the cli|mate, had &s;unk me into &s;o profound a &s;leep, that I was in&s;en&s;ible of their &s;tings, till I perceived the effects. The&s;e in&s;ects are inconceivably numerous here during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, and particularly on the banks of creeks or rivers. None are &s;ecured from their attacks, but they peculiarly infe&s;t &s;trangers in preference to the na|tives; and wherever they in&s;ert their probo&s;cis, and re|main

unmole&s;ted, they &s;uck the blood till they are &s;carcely able to fly. Every puncture they make is &s;uc|ceeded by a large blotch, or rather tumour, accompanied with an itching, which is almo&s;t intolerable. The pre|&s;ence of the mu&s;quitoes is indicated by their buzzing noi&s;e, which alone is &s;ufficient to make one &s;weat, and which is &s;o very di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e who have &s;uffered from their &s;tings, as to have obtained for them the name of the <HI>Devil's Trumpeters.</HI> They are indeed inconceiv|ably trouble&s;ome in every re&s;pect.

<P>The be&s;t cure for their &s;tings is an application of the juice of lemons or limes, mixed with water, which is al&s;o a tolerable pre&s;ervative again&s;t their attacks.

<P>On the morning of the 22d, an elderly negro-woman, with a black girl about fourteen, entering my apartment, it would be difficult to expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment when &s;he gravely pre&s;ented me her daughter, to become what &s;he was plea&s;ed to term my wife. I had &s;o little gallan|try, however, as to reject the offer with a loud laugh; but at the &s;ame time accompanied the refu&s;al with a &s;mall but welcome pre&s;ent, with which they appeared perfectly &s;atisfied, and departed with every po&s;&s;ible de|mon&s;tration of gratitude and re&s;pect. The girls here, who voluntarily enter into the&s;e connections, are &s;ome|times mulattoes, &s;ometimes Indians, and often negroes.

and &s;olemn. Young women of this de&s;cription cannot indeed be married, or connected in any other way, as mo&s;t of them are born or trained up in a &s;tate of &s;lavery; and &s;o little is the practice condemned, that while they continue faithful and con&s;tant to the part|ner by whom they are cho&s;en, they are countenanced and encouraged by their neare&s;t relations and friends, who call this a lawful marriage, nay, even the clergy avail them&s;elves of this cu&s;tom without re&s;traint; witne&s;s the Rev. Mr. S&mdash;dh&mdash;s, Mr. T&mdash;ll&mdash;t, &amp;c. Many of the &s;able-coloured beauties will however follow their own <HI>penchant</HI> without any re&s;traint whatever, refu&s;ing with contempt the golden bribes of &s;ome, while on others they be&s;tow their favours for a dram or a broken to|bacco-pipe, if not for nothing.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pitality I had experienced on our fir&s;t arrival in the colony was not confined to that time only: I had a general invitation to vi&s;it, be&s;ides his excellency the <HI>go|vernor,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Texier,</HI> the commandant, in more than twenty re&s;pectable families, whenever it &s;uited my convenience; &s;o that, though the officers of our corps had formed a regimental me&s;s, I had &s;eldom the honour of their company. One gentleman, a Mr. <HI>Kennedy,</HI> in particular, carried his politene&s;s &s;o far, as not only to offer me the u&s;e of his carriage, &s;addle-hor&s;es, and table, but even to pre&s;ent me with a fine negro boy, named <HI>Quaco,</HI> to carry my umbrella as long as I remained in Surinam. The other gentlemen of the regiment al&s;o
<PB N="27" REF="56">
met with great civilities, and the whole colony &s;eemed anxious to te&s;tify their re&s;pect, by vying with each other in a con&s;tant round of fe&s;tivity. Balls, concerts, card-a&s;&s;emblies, and every &s;pecies of amu&s;ement in their power, were con&s;tantly contrived for our entertain|ment. The &s;pirit of conviviality next reached on board the men-of-war, where we entertained the ladies with cold &s;uppers and dancing upon the quarter-deck, under an awning, till &s;ix in the morning, generally concluding the frolic by a cavalcade, or an airing in their carriages. This con&s;tant routine of di&s;&s;ipation, which was rendered &s;till more pernicious by the enervating effects of an in|ten&s;ely hot climate, where one is in a perpetual &s;tate of per&s;piration, already threatened to become <HI>fatal</HI> to two or three of our officers. Warned by their example, I retired from all public companies, &s;en&s;ible that by &s;uch means I could alone pre&s;erve my health, in a coun|try which has &s;uch a tendency to debilitate the human frame, that an European, however cautious to avoid exce&s;&s;es, has always rea&s;on to apprehend its dreadful effects.</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;ipation and luxury appear to be congenial to the inhabitants of this climate, and great numbers mu&s;t an|nually fall victims to their very de&s;tructive influence. Their fatal con&s;equences are indeed too vi&s;ible in the men, who have indulged them&s;elves in intemperance and other &s;en&s;ual gratifications, and who appear withered and enervated in the extreme; nor do the generality of
<PB N="28" REF="57">
the Creole females exhibit a more alluring appearance; they are languid, their complexions are &s;allow, and the &s;kin even of the young ladies is frequently &s;hrivelled. This is however not the ca&s;e with all; and I have been acquainted with &s;ome who, pre&s;erving a glow of health and fre&s;hne&s;s in their lovely countenance, were entitled to contend for the prize of beauty with the faire&s;t European. But, alas! the numbers of this la&s;t de&s;cription are &s;o &s;mall, that the coloni&s;ts in their amours mo&s;t u&s;ually prefer the Indian negro and mulatto girls, particularly on account of their remarkable cleanline&s;s, health, and vivacity. For the exce&s;&s;es of the hu&s;bands in this re&s;pect, and the marked neglect which they meet from them, the Creole ladies mo&s;t commonly, at a very early period, appear in mourning weeds, with the agreeable privilege however of making another choice, in the hopes of a better partner; nor are they long without another mate. Such indeed is the &s;uperior longevity of the fair females of Surinam, compared to that of the males (owing chiefly, as I &s;aid, to their exce&s;&s;es of all &s;orts) that I have frequently known wives who have buried four hu&s;bands, but never met a man in this country who had &s;urvived two wives.</P>
<P>The ladies do not, however, always bear with the mo&s;t becoming patience the &s;lights and in&s;ults they thus meet with, in the expectation of a &s;udden relea&s;e, but mo&s;tly per&s;ecute their &s;ucce&s;sful fable rivals (even on &s;u&s;picion) with implacable hatred and the mo&s;t unrelent|ing

barbarity; while they cha&s;ti&s;e their partners not only with a &s;hew of ineffable contempt, but with giving in public the mo&s;t unequivocal marks of preference towards tho&s;e gentlemen who newly arrive from Eu|rope; which occa&s;ioned the trite proverb and ob&s;erva|tion in the colony, that the Tropical ladies and the mu&s;|quitoes have an in&s;tinctive preference for a newly-landed European: this partiality is indeed &s;o very extreme, and the proofs of it &s;o very apparent and nau&s;eous, that &s;ome command of temper is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the di&s;gu&s;t which &s;uch behaviour mu&s;t naturally excite, particularly where the object is not very inviting; nay, it was even publicly reported at Paramaribo, that two of the&s;e <HI>Tropical Amazons</HI> had fought a <HI>duel</HI> for the &s;ake of one of our officers.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now mention a word or two of the Governor and Colonel Fourgeoud; when I will endeavour to put an end to this long chapter: for, notwith&s;tanding the polite reception our whole corps had met with ever &s;ince we fir&s;t landed in the colony, it was evident to perceive that mutual coolne&s;s which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and our commander in chief, who indeed gave the fir&s;t pub|lic cau&s;e of animo&s;ity, on the very day of our debarka|tion, by drawing up his regiment with their backs to|ward the governor's palace.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive that the di&s;gu&s;t which &s;o early and &s;o reciprocally manife&s;ted it&s;elf between the above two gentlemen, who were both of them our commanders,
<PB N="30" REF="59">
but totally independent of each other, could not but make our &s;tay at Paramaribo extremely di&s;agreeable to all the officers in our regiment, as well as tho&s;e of the Society corps: the con&s;equence of which was, that hav|ing re&s;ided but a few weeks in the colony, it was thought proper by the governor to acquaint Colonel Fourgeoud, that,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">as the rebel negroes &s;eemed no further di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;turb the tranquillity of the &s;ettlement, its own troops, and the corps of black rangers, were deemed &s;ufficient for its defence; in con&s;equence of which, Colonel Fourgeoud, with his marines, no longer being wanted, was at liberty to return to Europe whenever he thought proper."</Q></P>
<P>Various were the feelings of plea&s;ure and reluctance with which our gentlemen received this news: prepara|tions were, however, made for our departure; but in a few days the&s;e were again &s;u&s;pended by the inhabitants, who clamorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on our &s;taying; when the wooding and watering the ve&s;&s;els was provi&s;ionally &s;topped, but the &s;hips &s;till kept in commi&s;&s;ion on &s;peculation. It was during this interval of lei&s;ure and uncertainty that I &s;e|riou&s;ly thought of employing my&s;elf in writing a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the colony, and of drawing &s;uch objects as I thought mo&s;t &s;uitable to compleat my little plan. In the&s;e de&s;igns, be&s;ides con&s;ulting the be&s;t authors on the &s;ubject, I had the honour to be materially a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his excellency the governor, who not only favoured me with &s;everal manu&s;cripts, but daily furni&s;hed me with &s;uch a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II.</NOTE>THE di&s;covery of <HI>Guiana,</HI> by &s;ome called
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">the Wild Coa&s;t,"</Q>
has been long (though with uncertainty) attributed to the Spani&s;h commander <HI>Va&s;co Nunes,</HI> who, in the year 1504, after di&s;covering Cuba to be an i&s;land, landed on the continent of South America, penetrated as far as between the rivers <HI>Oroonoko</HI> and <HI>Amazon,</HI> and comprehended that country in the exten&s;ive tract of land, to which, in contradiction to Cuba and the adjacent i&s;lands, he gave the name of TERRA FIRMA.</P>
<P>This country, the length of which is about 1220, and the breadth about 680 geographical miles, is &s;ituated between eight degrees twenty minutes north, and three degrees &s;outh latitude, and between fifty and &s;eventy degrees twenty minutes we&s;t longitude from the meri|dian of London, in the N.

the heats in Guiana are much more &s;upportable than tho&s;e on that part of the African coa&s;t. The &s;corching rays of the &s;un are in Guiana daily tempered by cooling breezes from the &s;ea; while in Guinea the inten&s;e heat is increa&s;ed by the wind blowing continually over the land, and in its pa&s;&s;age traver&s;ing numerous &s;andy de&s;arts. The ea&s;terly or trade winds, which generally blow be|tween the Tropics, are extremely refre&s;hing to the coa&s;t of Guiana, between the hours of eight or ten in the morning, and &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when they cea&s;e to operate, and a zephyr is &s;carcely ever heard to whi&s;per during the night. The&s;e winds are &s;ucceeded by thick fogs, and vapours exhaled from the earth, which render the nights in this country not only very chilly, but ex|tremely damp and unhealthy. The length of the days and nights in Guiana never varies much more than forty minutes during the cour&s;e of the year, as the &s;un always ri&s;es about &s;ix in the morning, and &s;ets at the &s;ame hour in the evening.</P>
<P>The rainy and dry &s;ea&s;ons which divide the year, as cold and warm weather divide it in Europe, may be termed the winter and &s;ummer of this country. There is however one remarkable difference between the Euro|pean &s;ea&s;ons and tho&s;e in Guiana, which is, that Guiana has annually two winters and two &s;ummers, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by the appellation of the <HI>greater</HI> and the <HI>&s;maller,</HI> not becau&s;e the rains are le&s;s violent in the two latter &s;ea&s;ons, or the heat le&s;s inten&s;e, but from an opinion which has prevailed, that their pe|riod of duration is but about half as long as that of the
<PB N="32" REF="65">
former. This di&s;tinction however appears to be more imaginary than real, as far as re&s;pects the rainy &s;ea&s;ons; for as the&s;e downfalls of water only take place when the &s;un is vertical, which it is near the line twice a year, and for an equal portion of time, the continuance of the rains will probably be equal in both &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The difference between the dry &s;ea&s;ons indeed may be accounted for from the greater commencing in Surinam at the time when the &s;un is about to cro&s;s the equator in its cour&s;e to the tropic of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> often in October, when a continual drought and &s;corching heat begin to take place, till its return in March. This is &s;ucceeded by violent uninterrupted rains till June, during which time the &s;un has travelled to the tropic of <HI>Cancer,</HI> and a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on of parching heat again takes place, till about July, which is once more followed by ince&s;&s;ant rains till Octo|ber, and thus the revolution of the different &s;ea&s;ons is completed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot but notice in this place a &s;trange error, into which Mr. Guthrie has inadvertently fallen, in dating the commencement of the dry &s;ea&s;on at the north tropic, from the time when the &s;un is vertical at the tropic of Ca|pricorn; and de&s;cribing it as continuing till the &s;un is again vertical at Cancer, or from the beginning of January to the latter end of May.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The continuance of the rains during the time when the &s;un is vertical in this climate, is nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of animal and vegetable life, which without the&s;e &s;ea&s;onable refre&s;hments mu&s;t langui&s;h and expire under the fervid influence of its rays. But though I have mentioned &s;tated periods for the variations of the
<PB N="33" REF="66">
&s;ea&s;ons in Guiana, yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark that the&s;e changes are not uniformly produced at the &s;ame time, but, like the European &s;ea&s;ons, occa&s;ionally vary. The changes are always accompanied by tremendous claps of thunder, and very vivid fla&s;hes of lightning, which continue during &s;everal weeks, and are frequently fatal both to the cattle and inhabitants of this country.</P>
<P>Some parts of Guiana pre&s;ent a barren and moun|tainous a&s;pect, but in general the &s;oil is abundantly fruit|ful, the earth during the whole of the year adorned with continual verdure, the trees loaded at the &s;ame time with blo&s;&s;oms and ripe fruit, and the whole pre&s;enting to the view the delightful union of &s;pring and &s;ummer. This general appearance of fertility, particularly in Suri|nam, may be a&s;cribed not only to the rains and warmth in this climate, but al&s;o to its low and mar&s;hy &s;ituation, which prevents the inten&s;e heats from de&s;troying ve|getation, and from the extreme richne&s;s the &s;oil, par|ticularly in tho&s;e parts which are cultivated by European indu&s;try. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;uch &s;itua|tions are far from being favourable to health; but the &s;pirit of gain is a very powerful principle, and the cer|tainty of pre&s;ent profit will generally be con&s;idered as a weighty counterpoi&s;e to tho&s;e evils which, if ever encountered, appear at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and as they are &s;ometimes e&s;caped, may be always e&s;teemed as uncertain.</P>
<P>The uncultivated parts of Guiana are covered with
<PB N="34" REF="67">
immen&s;e fore&s;ts, rocks, and mountains; &s;ome of the latter enriched with a great variety of mineral &s;ub|&s;tances; and the whole country is inter&s;ected by very deep mar&s;hes or &s;wamps, and by exten&s;ive heaths or &s;a|vannas. The &s;tream along the coa&s;t flows continually towards the north-we&s;t; and the whole &s;hore is rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible from its being covered with danger|ous banks, quick&s;ands, bogs, and rocks, with prodigious bu&s;hes, and a large quantity of bru&s;hwood, which are &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven as to be impenetrable.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h, Portugueze, and Dutch, are the only nations which po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ettlements in this part of Terra Firma, excepting the &s;mall colony of Cayenne, belong|ing to the French, which is &s;ituated between the river Marawina and Cape Orange. The dominions in Guiana, &s;ubject to Spain, are &s;ituated on the banks of the Oronoque, and tho&s;e of Portugal extend along the &s;hores of the river Amazon. The Dutch &s;ettlements, which &s;pread along the coa&s;ts of the Atlantic ocean, and reach from Cape Na&s;&s;au to the river Marawina, are E&s;&s;equibo, Demerary, Berbice, and Surinam <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Map prefixed to this work.</NOTE>; the la&s;t of which is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and valuable, and that portion of the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to which the &s;ucceeding account will be chiefly confined. This indu&s;trious nation endeavour|ed, in the year 1657, to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;mall colony on the banks of the river Poumeron, but in 1666 this &s;ettlement
<PB N="35" REF="68">
was demoli&s;hed by the Engli&s;h. Nor were they more &s;ucce&s;sful in one which they founded in 1677, on the ri|ver Wiapoko or Oyapoa, which was immediately in|vaded and de&s;troyed by the French.</P>
<P>The Dutch con&s;ider the beautiful and once flouri&s;hing colony of Surinam as extending over the whole of that territory which is encircled on the we&s;t by the river Kanre or Cange, about forty miles from the Corantine, and on the ea&s;t by the river Sinamaree. But the&s;e li|mits are di&s;puted by the French, who confine the boun|dary of Surinam to the banks of the Marawina, upon which they &s;tation a military force.</P>
<P>The principal rivers that belong to this &s;ettlement are the river Surinam, from which the colony takes its name, the Corantine, the Copename, the Seramica, and the Marawina. Of tho&s;e rivers the fir&s;t only is navi|gable, the re&s;t, not excepting the Marawina, being, though very long and broad, &s;o &s;hallow, and &s;o extremely crouded with rocks and &s;mall i&s;lands, that they are of little con&s;equence to Europeans, nor are their banks in|habited except by &s;ome of the Indians or natives of the country. The river Surinam, who&s;e mouth is &s;ituated in about &s;ix degrees north latitude, is, at its entrance, nearly the breadth of four Engli&s;h miles, and in depth from &s;ixteen to eighteen feet at low-water mark, the tide ri&s;ing and falling above twelve feet; this breadth and depth is continued from its mouth upwards to the di&s;|tance of eight or ten miles, when it divides it&s;elf into
<PB N="36" REF="69">
two branches, winding to the S. S. E. for the length of upwards of 120 miles. All this extent is navigable for &s;mall craft, but beyond this di&s;tance the river pro|ceeds directly &s;outh; &s;ometimes in its cour&s;e &s;urround|ing &s;mall i&s;lands, and &s;ometimes forming &s;mall cataracts. The &s;ource of this beautiful river has never yet been di&s;covered by Europeans. All large ve&s;&s;els, after entering the Surinam, ought to keep rather near the ea&s;t &s;hore; the oppo&s;ite &s;ide being very full of &s;hoals, as far as the town of Paramaribo, which is about eighteen miles from its mouth. The other branch, into which this large river is divided, is named Comawina, and keeps due ea&s;t for about &s;ixteen miles, with a depth of about three or four fathom at high-water mark; but as the tide makes a difference of twelve feet, it is not con&s;idered as navi|gable for any &s;hips of burthen, though its breadth may be computed at about two miles. At the di&s;tance of &s;ixteen miles, the river Comawina is again divided into two branches, one of which bears the &s;ame name to the S. E. for a length of above fifty miles, and that of Cottica to the E. S. E. for more than forty miles, when this la&s;t takes a meandring cour&s;e to the S. S. W. for the di&s;tance of twenty-four or thirty miles. Into all the&s;e rivers, the cour&s;es of which are not &s;traight but &s;erpen|tine, are di&s;charged a number of very large creeks or rivu|lets, the banks of which are inhabited by Europeans, and cultivated with &s;ugar, cocoa, cotton, and indigo planta|tions, which form the mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pects that
<PB N="37" REF="70">
can be imagined to tho&s;e who travel by water, the uni|ver&s;al mode of journeying in this country, as the &s;oil is in general ill adapted for the con&s;truction of roads; and in &s;ome places the woods, &amp;c. are ab&s;olutely impe|netrable, a &s;mall path of communication between Para|maribo and the river Seramica being the only pa&s;&s;able road that I know of in the &s;ettlement. The rivers who&s;e banks are uncultivated, &s;uch as the Corantine, Copename, Seramica, and Marawina, afford but little matter for de&s;cription: it is therefore only nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that they are generally from two to four miles in breadth, exceedingly &s;hallow, and crowded with quick|&s;ands, &s;mall i&s;lands, and rocks, which form a number of beautiful ca&s;cades. In the river Marawina is frequently found a curious &s;tone or pebble, which is known by the name of the Marawina diamond, and which being po|li&s;hed, bears a very near re&s;emblance to that mo&s;t valu|able gem, and is con&s;equently often &s;et in rings, &amp;c. &amp;c. In all the above rivers, without exception, the water ri&s;es and falls for more than &s;ixty miles from the mouth, oc|ca&s;ioned by the &s;toppage of the fre&s;hes by the tide; yet fre&s;h water may generally be met with about twenty-four or thirty miles from the mouths of the&s;e rivers for watering the &s;hips. The water of the river Surinam is ac|counted the mo&s;t excellent, and is brought by the &s;ailors from as far as the Jew Savannah, which is above forty miles from the town of Paramaribo. The circum&s;tance
<PB N="38" REF="71">
mo&s;t injurious to &s;hips in the&s;e rivers is, that their bot|toms are often affected by a kind of water-worm, the ravages of which are the mo&s;t effectually prevented by frequently careening the ve&s;&s;els, in order that they may be properly cleaned, &s;craped, caulked, and payed. For that purpo&s;e the coal-tar, invented by the Earl of Dun|donald, (for which a patent of twelve years was granted to him) is greatly preferable to any other material which can be applied for this u&s;e.</P>
<P>It is high or low water nearly every &s;ix hours and half; the &s;pring tides ri&s;e regularly twice a month, when the river &s;wells to a con&s;iderable degree, which, from va|rious circum&s;tances, is often of infinite benefit to the planters.</P>
<P>It may be perhaps expected, in this place, that I &s;hould add a few words concerning the defence of the above ri|vers, though that is a &s;ubject which I purpo&s;e to treat more at large on another occa&s;ion. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the mouth of the river Surinam is a &s;mall promontory, called Braam's Point, which I think originally had been named Pram's, or Parham's Point, after Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham, to whom this &s;ettlement was granted by King Charles the Second in 1662, and which &s;pot is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t on which Lord Wil|loughby landed in 1652, ten years before he ob|tained the charter from his &s;overeign. This point is not fortified; but about eight miles upwards are two

redoubts, one on each &s;ide of the river, called Leyden and Purmerent, and a little higher up is the new fortre&s;s called Am&s;terdam, built on the point of land which &s;e|parates the two rivers, Surinam and Comewina, from each other; and who&s;e fire, cro&s;&s;ing with that of the two redoubts, protects the entry of both the&s;e rivers.</P>
<P>Near the town of Paramaribo, and about &s;ix or &s;even miles from the fortre&s;s Am&s;terdam, is the citadel which bears the name of Fort Zelandia, protecting the town and all the &s;hipping in the roads; and about &s;ixteen miles from Fort Am&s;terdam, on Rio Comewina, is a fortre&s;s called Somel&s;dyk, which commands the two oppo&s;ite &s;hores, viz. tho&s;e of Rio Comewina and Rio Cottica. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, there are military po&s;ts on the Corantine, the Seramica, and Marawina. Next to the&s;e is a &s;trong guard at the mouth of the Mott Creek, about thirty miles below the river Surinam, where a fire-beacon or light-hou&s;e is erected on the coa&s;t, to warn the &s;hips bound for the river that they are pa&s;t the mouth of the dangerous Ma|rawina. This guard al&s;o fires a few guns, to apprize the colony when &s;hips are within view and &s;teering for the coa&s;t. Along the higher parts of the rivers Surinam, Comewina, and Cottica, advanced guards are al&s;o con|tinually kept, to protect the inhabitants from inland in|va&s;ions by the Indians or fugitive negroes. In the&s;e for|tifications con&s;i&s;ts the principal defence of this &s;ettle|ment; be&s;ides a &s;mall armed bark or guarda-co&s;ta, which
<PB N="40" REF="73">
crui&s;es between the river Marawina and Berbice, to give intelligence in ca&s;e of any threatening danger to the colony.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgotten to mention, that a path fortified with military po&s;ts had been projected, and was actually begun, from the upper parts of the river Comawina to the river Seramica; but the plan did not &s;ucceed, and the line, which is called the orange-path, is at pre&s;ent in the &s;tate of a wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Having thus de&s;cribed the &s;urface of the country in general, with its boundaries, rivers, &amp;c. I &s;hall proceed to an account of the earlie&s;t di&s;coveries and mo&s;t remark|able revolutions of this once flouri&s;hing colony, which e&s;caped being vi&s;ited by the gallant Admiral Rodney in the la&s;t war.&mdash;That part of Terra Firma, which is called Guiana, or the Wild Coa&s;t, and in which lies the colony of Surinam, is &s;aid by &s;ome to have been fir&s;t found out by the ju&s;tly celebrated Chri&s;topher Columbus, in the year 1498, whence he was &s;ent home in chains; though others contend that it was not di&s;covered till the year 1504, by Va&s;co Nunes, a Spaniard, as was &s;tated in the beginning of this Chapter.</P>
<P>In 1595 it was vi&s;ited by Sir Walter Raleigh, under Queen Elizabeth, who al&s;o &s;ailed up the river Oronoque above 600 miles, in &s;earch of the &s;uppo&s;ed El Dorado, and in hopes of di&s;covering the gold-mines, of which he had the mo&s;t lively expectations, from &s;amples of a
<PB N="41" REF="74">
marca&s;ite, which the Spaniards call Madre de Oro <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this extraordinary enterprize the curious reader may &s;ee a full account, written by Sir Walter Raleigh him&s;elf, as it was publi&s;hed by Dr. Birch, in 1751, among the re&s;t of Raleigh's works, printed for Dod&s;ley, in two vols. octavo.</NOTE>. In 1634, a Captain Mar&s;hall, with about &s;ixty Engli&s;h, were di&s;covered in Surinam employed in planting tobacco, according to the relation of David Piter&s;e de Vries, a Dutchman, who conver&s;ed with them upon the &s;pot. In 1640, Surinam was inhabited by the French, who were obliged to leave it &s;oon after, on account of the frequent inva&s;ions which they ju&s;tly &s;uffered from the Caribbean Indians, for having, like their neighbours the Spaniards, treated them with the mo&s;t barbarous cruelties. In the year 1650, this colony being vacant, Francis Lord Wil|loughby of Parham, by King Charles the Second's per|mi&s;&s;ion, &s;ent thither one ve&s;&s;el, equipped by him&s;elf, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of his royal ma&s;ter; a little after which he di&s;patched three ve&s;&s;els more, one of them carrying twenty guns. All the&s;e were well received by the Indians or inhabitants of the country, with whom they entered into friendly treaties, and a kind of negociation. Two years after this Lord Willoughby went over him&s;elf, and leaving &s;everal good and whole|&s;ome laws and regulations for the government and de|fence of the colony, returned to England, whence he continued to &s;upply the &s;ettlement at his own expence with men and ammunition. On the &s;econd day of June,
<PB N="42" REF="75">
1662, the colony of Surinam was granted by charter of Charles the Second to Francis Lord Willoughby, and at that lord's de&s;ire to be divided with Lawrence Hide, &s;econd &s;on of Edward Earl of Clarendon, for them and their de&s;cendants for ever: the original record of this charter is to be found in the chapel of the Rolls. In 1664, the Engli&s;h captured the New Netherlands, &s;ince called New-York, from the Dutch.</P>
<P>In the year 1665, Surinam was &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated, mo&s;tly by planting tobacco. They had al&s;o rai&s;ed above forty fine &s;ugar plantations, and erected a &s;trong fortre&s;s of hewn &s;tone for their defence. It is proper however to remark, that &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e improvements were effected by the Portugue&s;e, though at what period is uncertain; while the French &s;trenuou&s;ly di&s;pute the point, and in&s;i&s;t that they were the work of Mon&s;ieur Pon&s;ert de Bretigny, when France had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country. However this may be, the fortre&s;s is &s;ituated about &s;ixteen or eighteen miles from the mouth of the river Surinam, and the&s;e indu&s;trious &s;ettlers found them|&s;elves perfectly happy in a &s;mall town which they had built under the walls. Their felicity was not of long duration; for in the wars between Charles the Second and the United Provinces, the Dutch having been driven in 1661 from the Brazils by the Portugue&s;e, took the colony of Surinam from the Engli&s;h in 1667, under the command of a Captain Abraham Criuvon, who was di&s;|patched
<PB N="43" REF="76">
for that purpo&s;e by the province of Zealand, with three &s;hips of war and 300 marines. The Engli&s;h commander, William Biam, lo&s;t the &s;ettlement of Suri|nam by &s;urprize, when above 600 of the be&s;t men in the colony were at work on the &s;ugar plantations. This neglect appears from the trifling lo&s;s of the Dutch, who in &s;torming the citadel had but one man killed. They immediately planted the Prince of Orange's flag on the ramparts, and gave now to this fortre&s;s the name of Zelandia, and that of New Middleburge to the town of Paramaribo, after making the inhabitants, among&s;t other contributions, pay one hundred thou&s;and pounds weight of &s;ugar, and &s;ending a number of them to the i&s;land of Tobago. This event took place in Fe|bruary, and in July following the peace was concluded at Breda. But, mo&s;t unluckily for the new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Surinam, it was concluded unknown to the Engli&s;h com|modore, Sir John Harman, who in October that &s;ame year, having fir&s;t taken Cayenne from the French, en|tered the river with a &s;trong fleet of &s;even &s;hips of war, two bomb-ketches, &amp;c. and retook the colony from the Dutch, killing on this occa&s;ion above fifty of their men, and de&s;troying nine pieces of cannon in Fort Zelandia. The new inhabitants were now in their turn laid under contribution, and the Dutch garri&s;on were tran&s;ported as pri&s;oners to the i&s;land of Barbadoes.</P>
<P>At the di&s;covery, in Surinam, that the peace had been concluded in Europe between the contending powers,
<PB N="44" REF="77">
before Commodore Harman retook the colony from the Dutch, con&s;iderable tumult and di&s;order took place among the inhabitants, who knew not whom they ought to acknowledge as their lawful &s;overeign. At length, by an order of King Charles, the &s;ettlement was ceded to the Dutch, in 1669, when twelve hundred of the old inhabitants, Engli&s;h and negroes together, left it, and went to &s;ettle on the i&s;land of Jamaica. At the clo&s;e of the &s;ucceeding war, it was agreed by the treaty of We&s;tmin&s;ter that Surinam &s;hould be the property of the Dutch for ever, in exchange for the province of New-York, which accordingly took place in the year 1674; and after this period the colony of Surinam was never more in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Great Britain. In 1678, a Mr. Heyn&s;ius was governor of the colony, and a Captain Lightenburgh commander of the troops.</P>
<P>The Dutch for the fir&s;t few years enjoyed little &s;atisfac|tion in their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as they were daily harra&s;&s;ed by the inva&s;ions of the Carribbean Indians, to whom they were much more obnoxious than the Engli&s;h had been: indeed they carried their re&s;entment &s;o far as to murder &s;everal of the Dutch &s;ettlers. In addition to this, the pro|vince of Zealand, to which the colony properly belonged, being perpetually at variance with the other United Pro|vinces concerning the &s;overeignty of this &s;ettlement, and not being of them&s;elves able to &s;upport the great expence which was requi&s;ite for its pre&s;ervation and defence, at la&s;t re&s;olved to &s;ell the whole to the Dutch We&s;t India

Company; which they did in the year 1682, for the &s;um of &pound;.23,636 &s;terling, including all the warlike &s;tores, ammunition, &amp;c. among&s;t which were fifty pieces of cannon. At the &s;ame time they obtained a charter from their high mightine&s;&s;es the States General, exempting them from duty for ten years. A few months after this, however, the We&s;t India Company, notwith&s;tanding the above charter of indemnification, finding the other ne|ce&s;&s;ary expences of the &s;ettlement al&s;o too great for them, again transferred two-thirds of the colony of Su|rinam, the one to the town of Am&s;terdam, the other to the hou&s;e of Somel&s;dyk, at the &s;ame price for which they had bought it, and the&s;e three together formed a &s;ociety, to whom (&s;till under the &s;anction of their high mightine&s;&s;es) was &s;ome time afterwards intru&s;ted, by a re&s;olution of the States General, the &s;ole and entire di|rection of the affairs of this country.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of Surinam, and in this manner all matters were finally &s;ettled, when Cornelius Van Aar|&s;en, lord of Somel&s;dyk (as being one of the proprietors) went over with three hundred men, with whom he al&s;o took &s;ome felons &s;entenced for tran&s;portation. At his ar|rival, in 1684, he took the command as governor general of the colony. He then created a court of policy, to a&s;|&s;i&s;t in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; with the members of which, as well as with the inhabitants, he lived in a &s;tate of continual di&s;&s;en&s;ion. The con&s;equence was, that they &s;ent &s;everal complaints again&s;t him to Europe, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="46" REF="79">
he had made a favourable peace with the Caribbee, Warowa, and Arawakka Indians, as well as with a few run-away negroes, who had been &s;ettled at Rio Copename &s;ince the Engli&s;h left the colony.</P>
<P>This unfortunate gentleman's reign, however, la&s;ted but a &s;hort &s;pace, viz. till the year 1688, when on the &s;ame day both the governor and deputy governor, Mr. Verboom, were murdered by their own &s;oldiers, owing, as was alledged, to their having not only forced the men to work like negroes in digging canals, &amp;c. but al&s;o obliged them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on very bad and &s;hort allowance, which drove them to this act of de&s;peration <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Somel&s;dyk had the character of a tyrant; he was, under the cloak of reli|gion, de&s;potic, pa&s;&s;ionate, brutal, and cruel; he even ordered an Indian chief's head to be &s;truck off for &s;ome dome&s;tic mi&s;demeanour, for which he could not produce, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e days, the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of authority.</NOTE>.&mdash;I am &s;orry to &s;ay this treatment is too frequently the ca&s;e in the &s;ettlements, as I &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to prove. Such indeed was the confidence of the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins, that they offered to give in their defence, and a&s;&s;ign their rea&s;ons for committing this act of cruelty.</P>
<P>As the particulars of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination are not uninte|re&s;ting, I &s;hall beg leave to tre&s;pa&s;s upon the reader's patience by a brief recital of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>The governor was walking under a grove of orange-trees, near his own hou&s;e, with Mr. Verboom, when unexpectedly ten or twelve armed &s;oldiers (&s;eemingly drunk) acco&s;ted them, and immediately in&s;i&s;ted on le&s;s work and better &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The governor drawing his
<PB N="47" REF="80">
&s;word to force them back, was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;hot through the body in many places, and died upon the &s;pot; his companion, on the other hand, received but one wound, and did not expire till the ninth day after. This done, the rioters, accompanied by &s;everal accom|plices, marched in triumph to Fort Zelandia, which they took without re&s;i&s;tance, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the gunpowder and victualling magazines. After this, the garri&s;on having joined them, they formed a ring, and cho&s;e out from among them a commander in chief, and &s;everal other officers to whom they all &s;wore to be faith|ful, as al&s;o to each other, to the la&s;t drop of their blood. What is very remarkable, is, that their new chief, the very &s;ame afternoon, ordered the body of the ma&s;&s;acred governor, Somel&s;dyk, to be interred in Fort Zelandia with decency and military honours; and even the great guns were fired from the walls, and three rounds with &s;mall arms by the rebels.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates and other inhabitants of Surinam now beheld them&s;elves in a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant &s;ituation, and were obliged even to enter into a capitulation with the in|&s;urgents in the fort, the principal articles of which were, that the latter &s;hould evacuate Fort Zelandia, for which they were to receive a few hundred pounds; that they were then to be permitted to embark on board the tran&s;port &s;hip Salamander, to quit the colony without mole&s;tation, and to &s;et &s;ail for what part of the world they &s;hould prefer: they accordingly, to the amount of above one
<PB N="48" REF="81">
hundred, were &s;ent on board; but no &s;ooner did they prepare to weigh anchor for their departure, than the &s;hip was boarded by &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, privately arm|ed and manned for the purpo&s;e. The rebels were com|pelled to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, and a few days after were tried for murder and rebellion; when eleven of the ringleaders were executed, three of them were broke alive upon the rack, and eight were hanged on the gal|lows in irons. The re&s;t obtained their pardon; but be|ing no longer to be depended on, were gradually di&s;|charged from the colonial &s;ervice, when others could be procured to replace them.</P>
<P>In the following year the widow of Somel&s;dyk offered to transfer her portion in this &s;ettlement to King William the Third, but to no purpo&s;e; while a Mr. Scherpen|hayzoen was &s;ent over to Surinam from Holland, with a fre&s;h &s;upply of men and ammunition, to take the com|mand in the room of the late Lord of Somel&s;dyk, as go|vernor of the colony. Mr. Scherpenhayzoen, at his arrival, finding every thing in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, in order to apply the &s;peedie&s;t means of redre&s;s, e&s;tabli&s;hed a court of ju&s;tice, which differed from that formed by his prede|ce&s;&s;or, Governor Somel&s;dyk, in this particular, that the for|mer is inve&s;ted with the management of all military and criminal affairs, and the latter with that of all civil pro|ce&s;&s;es and pecuniary matters. Both of the&s;e courts &s;till remain, and of both the governor is always pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>This gentleman was al&s;o very diligent in e&s;tabli&s;hing
<PB N="49" REF="82">
many good laws and in&s;titutions; and had ju&s;t begun to put the colony in a proper &s;tate of defence (of which at this time it &s;tood greatly in need) again&s;t its dome&s;tic and foreign enemies, when war was declared between France and the United Provinces; and the &s;ame year the &s;ettlement of Surinam was attacked by Admiral Duca&s;&s;e with a &s;trong fleet, which, however, Governor Scherpenhayzon very courageou&s;ly beat off, after they had begun to cannonade Fort Zelandia.</P>
<P>In 1692 Jeronimus Clifford, an Engli&s;hman, was con|demned to be hanged (which &s;entence was changed to &s;even years impri&s;onment in the fortre&s;s Somel&s;dyk) on pretence of having in&s;ulted a magi&s;trate who had ar|re&s;ted him for debt. On application, however, from the court of Great Britain, he was &s;et at liberty in 1695, by de&s;ire of the King, when he made a demand on the colony of 20,000 guineas, for damages and fal&s;e impri&s;on|ment; which being refu&s;ed, his heirs have continued to claim it &s;ince 1700 to &s;o late as 1762, but hitherto without obtaining any &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>During the &s;ucceeding war which happened in 1712, the French Commodore Jaques Ca&s;&s;ard, met with the &s;ame reception from Governor De Gooyer, which Duca&s;&s;e had experienced from Scherpenhayzon before Zelandia; but four months after he returned with better &s;ucce&s;s, and laid the colony under contribution for a &s;um of about 56,6181. &s;terling. It was on the 10th of October that he
<PB N="50" REF="83">
entered the river of Surinam, with &s;ix or eight &s;hips of war, accompanied by a number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, in which fleet were embarked 3000 men. The large&s;t &s;hips were Le Neptune of 74, on board which he him&s;elf commanded

<P>The 11th Ca&s;&s;ard &s;ent a long-boat with a white flag, and an officer to treat with the inhabitants for contribu|tions, which, if they refu&s;ed to pay, he threatened to bombard the town of Paramaribo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 1667, Captain Abraham Crui&s;en gave the town the name of new Middleburg; but it was before and after called nothing but Paramaribo, which is &s;aid to be the true Indian name, and &s;hould &s;ignify The Spot of Flowers. This is the general account. But in my opi|nion not only Parham's Point, but the Para Creek, and the town of Paramaribo, nay, even the great water called the Golden Parima, on Parham Lake, took their names from Francis Lord Wil|loughby of Parham; who, as I have men|tioned, received this &s;ettlement from Charles the Second, and was one of the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this beautiful country. Surinam is al&s;o called a province by the Dutch, but mo&s;tly known by the name of colony, &s;ettlement, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The boat, however, was obliged to return on board without any &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. The river Surinam, ju&s;t before Fort Zelandia, being above a mile in breadth, the Medu&s;e and &s;everal flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els with French troops, being favoured by a very dark night, found means to &s;ail up beyond Paramaribo without being ob&s;erved by the Dutch, with an intention to plunder the &s;ugar and coffee plantations
<PB N="51" REF="84">
that are &s;ituated above that town: but on the 15th, the be&s;ieged prepared two large flat-bottomed barges filled with combu&s;tible matters, &s;uch as old junk, tar-barrels, &amp;c. and anchored them on the other &s;ide of the river, directly oppo&s;ite to the town, to which fire being applied, both were &s;et in a blaze, and di&s;covered the &s;malle&s;t boats of the enemy as they tried to get up the river through the darkne&s;s of the night. Thus di&s;covered, few e&s;|caped without damage from the guns of the fort, and tho&s;e of the trading ve&s;&s;els that lay in the roads, who &s;unk &s;ome of the flat-bottomed boats, a great part of the crews of which were drowned. This &s;tratagem, how|ever, did not prevent Ca&s;&s;ard's people, who had ha&s;ted for|ward, from pillaging and &s;etting on fire the plantations; while he him&s;elf, having at la&s;t anchored before the town of Paramaribo, threw above thirty &s;hells into it, and kept up a clo&s;e cannonade both upon that and Fort Zelandia, till the 20th of October, when he &s;ent a &s;econd me&s;&s;age with one of his captains to the Dutch, demanding of them finally, whether they would capitulate and pay contri|bution, which, if they now dared to refu&s;e, he threatened fire and de&s;truction to the whole &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>The Dutch finding their ruin inevitable if they per|&s;i&s;ted, demanded three days ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities to de|liberate, which being granted, they at la&s;t complied with commodore Ca&s;&s;ard's demands; and accordingly on the 27th, a treaty of twenty-four articles being &s;ettled be|tween

them, they paid the demanded contribution of 56,6181. &s;terling to the French, principally in &s;ugar, negro &s;laves, &amp;c. having but little gold or &s;ilver in the colony. This was no &s;ooner accompli&s;hed, than the commodore weighed anchor, on the 6th of December, 1712, and with his whole fleet left the &s;ettlement of Surinam.</P>

<P>NO &s;ooner was this unfortunate colony delivered from its external and avowed enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III.</NOTE> than it was attacked by internal foes of a more fierce and de&s;|perate nature.</P>
<P>The Carribbean and other Indians had, indeed, in former times, often di&s;turbed this &s;ettlement; but, as I have already mentioned, a peace being e&s;tabli&s;hed with them, after the arrival of Governor Somel&s;dyk in this colony, they have inviolably adhered to it ever &s;ince, living in the greate&s;t harmony and friend&s;hip with the Europeans.</P>
<P>The revolted negro &s;laves are the enemies of whom I now propo&s;e to &s;peak, who for &s;ome time diffu&s;ed a general terror over this &s;ettlement, and threatened its total lo&s;s to the &s;tates of Holland.</P>
<P>From the earlie&s;t remembrance &s;ome fugitive negroes have taken refuge in the woods of Surinam; but the&s;e were of very &s;mall con&s;ideration till about the year 1726, or 1728, when their ho&s;tile numbers were much increa&s;ed, and they had acquired lances and firelocks, which they had pillaged from the e&s;tates. By the acce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="87">
arms, in addition to their u&s;ual weapons, bows and ar|rows, they were enabled to commit continual outrages and depredations upon the coffee and &s;ugar plantations, as well from a &s;pirit of revenge for the inhuman treat|ment which they had formerly received from their ma&s;ters, as with a view of carrying away plunder, and principally gunpowder and ball, hatchets, &amp;c. in order to provide for their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and defence.</P>
<P>The&s;e negroes were in general &s;ettled in the upper parts of the river Copename and Seramica, from the latter of which they take the name of the Seramica rebels, in di&s;tinction from the other gangs which have &s;ince revolted.</P>
<P>Several detachments of military and plantation people were &s;ent again&s;t them, but were of very &s;mall effect in reducing them to obedience by promi&s;es, or extir|pating them by force of arms.</P>
<P>In 1730, a mo&s;t &s;hocking and barbarous execution of eleven of the unhappy negro captives was re&s;olved upon, in the expectation that it might terrify their companions, and induce them to &s;ubmit. One man was hanged alive upon a gibbet, by an iron hook &s;tuck through his ribs; two others were chained to &s;takes, and burnt to death by a &s;low fire. Six women were broken alive upon the rack, and two girls were decapitated. Such was their re|&s;olution under the&s;e tortures, that they endured them without even uttering a &s;igh.&mdash;

And &s;o it actually was in this in&s;tance, for this inhuman ma&s;&s;acre produced an effect very contrary to what had been expected. Indeed it &s;o much enraged the Seramica rebels, that for &s;everal years they became dreadful to the coloni&s;ts; who no longer being able to &s;upport the ex|pences and fatigues of &s;allying out again&s;t them in the woods, in addition to the great lo&s;&s;es which they &s;o fre|quently &s;u&s;tained by their inva&s;ions, of which they lived in continual terror, at la&s;t re&s;olved to treat for peace with their &s;able enemies.</P>
<P>Governor Mauricius, who was at this period at the head of the colony, now &s;ent out a &s;trong detachment to the rebel &s;ettlement at the Seramica river, for the pur|po&s;e of effecting, if po&s;&s;ible, a peace &s;o ardently de&s;ired. This detachment, after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hing with the &s;trag|gling rebel parties, at la&s;t arrived at their head quarters, where they demanded and obtained a parley. A treaty of peace, con&s;i&s;ting of ten or twelve articles, was actually concluded between the different parties in the year 1749, &s;imilar to that which had been made by the Engli&s;h in the year 1739, with the rebels in the i&s;land of Jamaica.&mdash; The chief of the Seramica rebels was a Creole negro,
<PB N="56" REF="89">
called Captain Adoe, who upon this occa&s;ion received from the governor, as a pre&s;ent, a fine large cane, with a &s;ilver pummel, on which were engraven the arms of Surinam, as a mark of their independence, and a preli|minary to the other pre&s;ents that were to be &s;ent out the year following as &s;tipulated by treaty, particularly arms and ammunition, on the performance of which the peace was to be finally concluded. Adoe pre&s;ented in return a hand&s;ome bow, with a complete ca&s;e of arrows, which had been manufactured by his own hands, as a token that during that time all enmity &s;hould cea&s;e on his &s;ide.</P>
<P>This affair gave great &s;atisfaction to many and indeed to mo&s;t of the inhabitants of Surinam, who now flatter|ed them&s;elves that their effects were perfectly &s;ecure; while others regarded this treaty as a very hazardous re|&s;ource, and even as a &s;tep to the inevitable ruin of the colony.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s indeed, that, notwith&s;tanding the good in|tentions of Governor Mauricius, nothing appears to be more dangerous than making a forced friend&s;hip with people, who by the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery and ill u&s;age are pro|voked to break their chains, and &s;hake off their yoke in pur&s;uit of revenge and liberty, and who by the tru&s;t which is placed in them have it in their power to become from day to day more formidable.</P>
<P>The in&s;urrection having ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, the co|loni&s;ts ought perhaps to have continued to oppo&s;e it, while they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of oppo&s;ition, not indeed
<PB N="57" REF="90">
from a motive of cruelty, but for the political good of &s;o fine a &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>If it appeared that cruelty and ill treatment had driven the&s;e poor creatures to the&s;e extremities, policy, not le&s;s than humanity, ought to have dictated to the coloni&s;ts a different conduct in future; but it may be a&s;ked, Whether it is po&s;&s;ible to keep the African negroes in habits of obe|dience and indu&s;try without the &s;tricte&s;t and often the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline?&mdash;No. But I a&s;k again, Why is it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to inflict &s;uch inhuman tortures, according to the humour and caprice of an unfeeling ma&s;ter, or a &s;till more unprincipled over&s;eer? Why &s;hould their rea&s;on|able complaints be never heard by a magi&s;trate who has it in his power to redre&s;s them? Is it becau&s;e this ma|gi&s;trate is a planter, and that he is intere&s;ted in the arbi|trary government of this unhappy race?&mdash;This is too evident.&mdash;It would, however, be great inju&s;tice if I were not to bear witne&s;s that I have not unfrequently &s;een the plantation &s;laves treated with the utmo&s;t humanity, where the hand of the ma&s;ter was &s;eldom lifted, but to care&s;s them; and where the eye of the &s;lave &s;parkled with gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed, and &s;ee what were the fruits of making peace with the Seramica rebels.</P>
<P>In 1750, which was the year after, the promi&s;ed pre|&s;ents were di&s;patched to Captain Adoe; but the detach|ment that carried them were attacked on their march, and the whole of the corps murdered on the &s;pot by a
<PB N="58" REF="91">
de&s;perate negro, called Zam Zam, who not having been con&s;ulted concerning the treaty of peace, had afterwards put him&s;elf at the head of a &s;trong party, and now car|ried off the whole &s;tock of the detachment, con&s;i&s;ting of arms, ammunition, checked linens, canvas cloth, hatchets, faws, and other carpenter's tools; be&s;ides &s;alt beef, pork, &s;pirits, &amp;c. and kept them as his own private property. Adoe, on the other hand, not receiving the pre&s;ents at the time he expected, too ha&s;tily concluding he was only to be amu&s;ed with expectation till a reinforcement of troops &s;hould arrive from Europe to &s;ubdue him, renew|ed his incur&s;ions: by this accident therefore the peace was immediately broken; cruelties and ravages increa&s;ed more than before, and death and de&s;truction once more raged throughout the colony.</P>
<P>In 1751, this &s;ettlement was in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion; when, in compliance with a reque&s;t of the inha|bitants, pre&s;ented to the States General, Baron Spoke was &s;ent to Surinam, with &s;ix hundred fre&s;h troops drafted from the different regiments in the Dutch &s;ervice, and on their arrival the members of the court were ordered to &s;end Governor Mauricius to Europe, to account for his proceedings; who never returned to the colony, having in 1753 a&s;ked and obtained his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, after having been honourably acquitted. Baron Spoke, who during the ab|&s;ence of Mauricius was appointed to officiate as governor, found every thing in the greate&s;t di&s;order, di&s;union hav|ing even ari&s;en between the inhabitants and their rulers,
<PB N="59" REF="92">
to which it was highly nece&s;&s;ary to apply the &s;peedie&s;t means of redre&s;s. This application was indeed made by the Baron, but he died the year after, and a general di&s;|traction again took place.</P>
<P>In 1757, the a&s;pect of affairs daily becoming wor&s;e, (during the admini&s;tration of a Mr. Cromelyn, who now was governor of this colony) a new revolt broke out in the Tempaty Creek among&s;t the negroes, owing to the treatment which they received from their ma&s;ters. This fre&s;h in&s;urrection indeed &s;oon became of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equence. The new rebels joined them&s;elves to &s;ixteen hundred of the old fugitive negroes already &s;ettled in eight different villages near Tempaty Creek, and after repeated battles and &s;kirmi&s;hes, the enemy be|ing mo&s;tly well armed, and in their re&s;i&s;tance generally &s;ucce&s;sful, the coloni&s;ts &s;aw them&s;elves once more re|duced to &s;ue for peace with their own &s;laves, near Tem|paty Creek, as they had done in the year 1749 with the rebels of Seramica.</P>
<P>During this la&s;t revolt, a Captain Mayer, of the Society Troops, being tried for cowardice by a court martial, and found guilty, was ordered to be &s;hot through the head; he was accordingly led to the place of execution, where, after every preparation for completing the &s;en|tence, he was pardoned by the Governor, who not only &s;hewed him every civility, but actually preferred him to the rank of major.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="93">To evince the ab&s;urdity of that prejudice, which con|&s;iders human creatures as brutes, merely becau&s;e they differ from our&s;elves in colour, I mu&s;t beg leave to men|tion a few of the principal ceremonies that attended the ratification of this peace.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed by the coloni&s;ts was a parley, which was agreed to by the rebels; when the la&s;t not only de&s;ired, but ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted, that the Dutch &s;hould &s;end them yearly, among&s;t a great variety of other ar|ticles, a quantity of good fire-arms and ammunition, as &s;pecified in a long li&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed in broken Engli&s;h, by a negro who&s;e name was Bo&s;ton, and who was one of their captains.</P>
<P>Governor Cromelyn next &s;ent two commi&s;&s;ioners, Mr. Sober and Mr. Abercrombie, who marched through the woods, e&s;corted by a few military, &amp;c. to carry &s;ome pre|&s;ents to the rebels, previous to the ratification of the peace, for which they now were commi&s;&s;ioned finally to treat.</P>
<P>At the arrival of the above gentlemen in the rebel camp, at the Jocka Creek, about fifteen miles ea&s;t of the Tempaty Creek, they were introduced to a very hand|&s;ome negro, called <HI>Araby,</HI> who was their chief, and born in the fore&s;ts among&s;t the la&s;t &s;ixteen hundred that I have ju&s;t mentioned. He received them very politely, and taking them by the hand, de&s;ired they would &s;it down by his &s;ide upon the green; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring them they need not be under any apprehen&s;ions of evil, &s;ince
<PB N="61" REF="94">
from their coming in &s;o good a cau&s;e, not one intended, or even dared to hurt them.</P>
<P>When the above-mentioned Captain Bo&s;ton, however, perceived that they had brought a parcel of trinkets, &s;uch as knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, combs, and &s;mall looking-gla&s;&s;es, and forgotten the principal articles in que&s;tion, viz. gun|powder, fire-arms, and ammunition, he re&s;olutely ap|proached the commi&s;&s;ioners, and demanded, in a thun|dering voice, whether the Europeans imagined that the negroes could live on combs and looking-gla&s;&s;es; adding, that one of each was quite &s;ufficient to let them all &s;ee their faces, while a &s;ingle gallon of <HI>man&s;ancy,</HI> viz. gunpowder, would have been accepted as a proof of their confidence; but &s;ince that had been omitted, he &s;hould never con&s;ent to their return to their countrymen, till every article of the li&s;t &s;hould be di&s;patched to them, and con&s;equently the treaty fulfilled.</P>
<P>This expo&s;tulation occa&s;ioned the interference of a negro captain, called Quacoo, who declared that the&s;e gentlemen were only the me&s;&s;engers of their governor and court; and as they could not be an&s;werable for their ma&s;ter's proceedings, they &s;hould certainly return to the &s;ettlement without injury or in&s;ult, and no per|&s;on, not even he, Captain Bo&s;ton, &s;hould dare to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>The chief of the rebels then ordered &s;ilence, and de|&s;ired Mr. Abercrombie to make up a li&s;t him&s;elf, of &s;uch articles as he, Araby, &s;hould &s;pecify; which that gentle|man
<PB N="62" REF="95">
having done, and promi&s;ed to deliver, the rebels not only gave him and his companions leave peaceably to return with it to town, but allowed their governor and court a whole year to deliberate whether they were to chu&s;e peace or war, unanimou&s;ly &s;wearing that during that interval all animo&s;ity &s;hould cea&s;e on their &s;ide; af|ter which, having entertained them in the be&s;t manner their &s;ituation in the woods afforded, they wi&s;hed them a happy journey to Paramaribo.</P>
<P>One of the rebel officers, on this occa&s;ion, repre&s;ented to the commi&s;&s;ioners how deplorable it was that the Europeans, who pretended to be a civilized nation, &s;hould be &s;o much the occa&s;ion of their own ruin by their inhuman cruelties towards their &s;laves.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We de|&s;ire you,"
continued the negro, "to tell your governor and your court, that in ca&s;e they want to rai&s;e no new gangs of rebels, they ought to take care that the planters keep a more watchful eye over their own pro|perty, and not to tru&s;t them &s;o frequently in the hands of drunken managers and over&s;eers, who by wrong|fully and &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ing the negroes, debauch|ing their wives and children, neglecting the &s;ick, &amp;c. are the ruin of the colony, and wilfully drive to the woods &s;uch numbers of &s;tout active people, who by their &s;weat earn your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, without who&s;e hands your colony mu&s;t drop to nothing; and to whom at la&s;t, in this di&s;graceful manner, you are glad to come and &s;ue for friend&s;hip."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="96">Mr. Abercrombie now begged that he might be ac|companied by one or two of their principal officers to Paramaribo, where he promi&s;ed they &s;hould be well treated; but the chief, Araby, an&s;wered him with a &s;mile, that it was time enough a year after, when the peace &s;hould be thoroughly concluded; that then even his younge&s;t &s;on &s;hould be at their &s;ervice, to receive his education among them, while for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and even for that of his dependants, he &s;hould take the &s;ole care upon him&s;elf, without ever giving the Chri&s;tians the &s;malle&s;t trouble.</P>
<P>After this, the commi&s;&s;ioners left the rebels, and the whole detachment arrived &s;afe at Paramaribo.</P>
<P>The year of deliberation being ended, the governor and court &s;ent out two fre&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners to the negro camp, to bring the &s;o much wi&s;hed-for peace to a tho|rough conclu&s;ion; which, after much debate, and many ceremonies on both &s;ides, was at la&s;t finally agreed upon. Pre&s;ents were promi&s;ed to be &s;ent by the Chri&s;tians, agreeable to the wi&s;hes of the negroes; while the&s;e la&s;t, as a proof of their affection to the Europeans, in&s;i&s;ted that each of the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould, during their remain|ing &s;tay in the rebel camp, take for his con&s;tant companion one of their hand&s;ome&s;t young women.&mdash;They treated them al&s;o liberally with game, fi&s;h, fruit, and the choice&s;t productions of the fore&s;t, and entertained them, without intermi&s;&s;ion, with mu&s;ic, dancing, and repeated volleys.</P>
<P>At the return of the commi&s;&s;ioners, the &s;tipulated pre|&s;ents
<PB N="64" REF="97">
were &s;ent to the negroes at the Jocka Creek, and, what is remarkable, under the care of the identical Mr. Mayer, who had formerly not dared to fight again&s;t them, and e&s;corted by &s;ix hundred men, &s;oldiers and &s;laves. The pu&s;illanimity of this gentleman, however, appeared again on this occa&s;ion, and he had nearly un|done the whole bu&s;ine&s;s by departing from his orders, delivering all the pre&s;ents to the rebels without receiving the ho&s;tages in return. Fortunately Araby kept his word, and &s;ent down four of his be&s;t officers as pledges to Paramaribo. By this the peace was perfectly accom|pli&s;hed, and a treaty of twelve or fourteen articles was &s;igned by the white commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;ixteen of Ara|by's black captains, in 1761; which ceremony took place on the plantation <HI>Ouca,</HI> in the river Surinam, where all the parties met, this being the &s;pot of rendezvous ap|pointed for the purpo&s;e, after four different emba&s;&s;ies had been &s;ent from the Europeans to the negroes.</P>
<P>Signing this treaty alone, however, was &s;till not con|&s;idered as &s;ufficient by the rebel chief Araby and his people. They immediately bound them&s;elves by an oath, and in&s;i&s;ted on the commi&s;&s;ioners doing the &s;ame, after the manner which is practi&s;ed by them&s;elves, not tru&s;ting entirely, they alledged, to that made u&s;e of by the Chri&s;tians, which they had &s;een them too frequently violate. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed, that the negroes them&s;elves are uncommonly tenacious of the&s;e &s;olemn engagements, as I never heard of an in&s;tance, during all
<PB N="65" REF="98">
the time I re&s;ided in the colony, of one of them vio|lating his oath.</P>
<P>The &s;olemnity made u&s;e of on this day, con&s;i&s;ted in each party's letting a few drops of blood with a lancet or penknife from the arm, into a calliba&s;h or cup of clear &s;pring water, in which were al&s;o mixed a few particles of dry earth, and of this all pre&s;ent were obliged to drink, without exception, which they call drinking each other's blood, having fir&s;t &s;hed a few drops upon the ground by way of libation; when their gadoman or prie&s;t, with up-ca&s;t eyes and out-&s;tretched arms, took heaven and earth to witne&s;s, and with a mo&s;t audible voice and in a mo&s;t awful manner, invoked the cur&s;e of the Almighty on tho&s;e who &s;hould fir&s;t break through this &s;acred treaty made between them, from that moment forward to all eternity. To this &s;olemn imprecation the multi|tude an&s;wered <HI>Da &s;o!</HI> which &s;ignifies in their language <HI>Amen</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This fact is noticed by the Abb&eacute; Raynal.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The &s;olemnity being ended, the chief Araby and each of his captains (to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the in|ferior negroes, as the Seramican chief Adoe had been before in 1749) was pre&s;ented with a fine large cane and &s;ilver pummel, on which was al&s;o engraven the arms of the colony.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned negroes are called <HI>Oucas,</HI> after the name of the plantation where the peace articles were &s;igned; and by that name they are &s;ince di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from tho&s;e of Seramica, whom I have already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>At this time the charter was renewed to the We&s;t India Company by their High Mightine&s;&s;es, for the term of thirty years longer (as it had been before in 1670, 1700, and 1730) in con&s;ideration of a loan of about five million &s;terling, at the rate of &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ame year peace was al&s;o a &s;econd time con|cluded with the Seramica rebels, who were at that time commanded by a negro called <HI>Wille,</HI> in&s;tead of their former chief Adoe, who was dead. But this &s;econd peace was unfortunately broken by a rebel captain, called Muzinga, who had received none of the pre&s;ents, which
<PB N="67" REF="100">
had in fact been again intercepted and captured on their way to the chief <HI>Wille,</HI> as they had been formerly on their way to the chief Adoe, by the very &s;ame enter|pri&s;ing and rapacious plunderer Zam Zam, with this difference only, that none of the detachment that were &s;ent with them were now murdered, as on the preceding occa&s;ion, nor even one &s;ingle per&s;on injured.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;uppo&s;ed breach of faith, captain Muzinga fought mo&s;t de&s;perately again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, he gave battle face to face, and beat back, at clo&s;e quarters, above one hundred and fifty of their be&s;t troops, killing num|bers, and carrying off all their baggage and ammu|nition.</P>
<P>Soon after this, however, when the real cau&s;e of Muzinga's di&s;content was known, means were found and adopted to pacify this gallant warrior, by making him receive and &s;hare the pre&s;ents &s;ent out by the coloni&s;ts, on an equal footing with his brother heroes, when peace was a third and la&s;t time concluded in 1762, be|tween the Seramica rebels and the colony, which has providentally been kept &s;acred and inviolable, as well as that with the Ouca negroes, to this day. By their exer|tions in the field they thus obtained their freedom.</P>
<Q><L>"O Liberty! thou godde&s;s heavenly bright,</L>

<P>The ho&s;tages and chief officers of both the above|mentioned negro cohorts, on their arrival at Parama|ribo, were entertained at the governor's own table, having previou&s;ly paraded in &s;tate through the town, accompanied by his excellency in his own private carriage.</P>
<P>By their capitulation with the Dutch, the above Ouca and Seramica rebels mu&s;t yearly receive, as I have men|tioned, a quantity of arms and ammunition from the colony, for which the Europeans have received in return the negroes' promi&s;es of being their faithful allies, to deliver up all their de&s;erters, for which they are to receive proper premiums, never to appear armed at Paramaribo above five or &s;ix at a time, and al&s;o to keep their &s;ettlement at a proper di&s;tance from the town and plantations: the Seramica negroes at the river Seramica, and tho&s;e of the Ouca negroes at the Jocka|creek, near the river Marawina, where one or two white men, called po&s;t-holders, were to re&s;ide among them, in the quality of envoys.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e tribes were &s;uppo&s;ed, at the period I &s;peak of, to amount in all to three thou&s;and, and but a few years after, by tho&s;e that were &s;ent to vi&s;it their &s;ettlements (including wives and children) they were computed to
<PB N="69" REF="102">
be not le&s;s than fifteen or twenty thou&s;and. They are already become overbearing and even in&s;olent, brandi&s;h|ing their &s;ilver-headed canes in defiance of the inha|bitants, and forcing from them liquors, and very often money, and reminding them how cruelly their ance&s;tors had murdered their parents and their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, and their numbers increa&s;|ing from day to day, I mu&s;t conclude, that &s;hould the peace be ever broken, the&s;e new allies will become the mo&s;t dreadful foes that ever the colony of Surinam can have to contend with.</P>
<P>In 1763 the town of Paramaribo would have been burnt down to the ground, had it not been prevented by the courage and intrepidity of the &s;ailors, who, at the hazard of their lives, without other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, pre|vented a general conflagration.</P>
<P>About this time a mutiny broke out on board the outward-bound Ea&s;t Indiaman, Neimburgh, commanded by Captain Ketell. The crew, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of French and German de&s;erters, who had been kidnapped in Holland, ro&s;e in arms again&s;t their &s;uperiors, and having murdered mo&s;t of the officers and warrant officers, while others were put in chains, carried the ve&s;&s;el to the Brazils, there the ringleaders went on &s;hore, and being engaged in riot and di&s;putation &s;oon di&s;covered what they were to the Portugue&s;e governor, in con&s;equence of which they were all taken into cu&s;|tody; but their accomplices on board &s;u&s;pecting what
<PB N="70" REF="103">
had happened, immediately &s;lipped their cable, and &s;et &s;ail for the i&s;land of Cayenne, where this piracy was put to an end; for the French &s;eizing &s;hip and crew, deli|vered both to the colony of Surinam, where, in 1764, &s;even of the mo&s;t guilty were executed on board the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el which they had captured, then at anchor in the roads before the town of Paramaribo. One of the&s;e un|happy wretches was decapitated, and &s;ix hanged to the yard-arm, who&s;e heads were al&s;o chopped off and plant|ed upon iron &s;pikes on the beach, in a cage made for the purpo&s;e. The others, who had been taken by the Por|tugue&s;e, were &s;ent from the Brazils to Am&s;terdam, after which they were al&s;o executed in Texel roads on board the We&s;telingwerf man of war, which &s;hip was that &s;ent out with us from Holland: their bodies were after|wards gibbeted in iron harne&s;s, and placed for an example along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;ame year al&s;o, three of the &s;ociety or colony &s;oldiers, who had been guilty of mutiny and de&s;ertion, were executed in Surinam; but as their ca&s;e is the mo&s;t peculiar of its kind that ever happened, I mu&s;t al&s;o beg leave to give &s;ome account of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>During the time of an in&s;urrection, which happened in the year 1761 among the negro &s;laves in the colony of Berbice, where they had not been treated &s;o cruelly as in other colonies, not only a regiment of marines, commanded by Colonel de Sal&s;e, which now belongs to General Douglas, was &s;ent over from Holland to that

<P>During the&s;e troubles, it happened that one officer and about &s;eventy men, &s;ent from the colony of Surinam, had been po&s;ted on the banks of the river Corrantine. This detachment, together with a party of Indians, who are natural enemies to the negroes, but friends to the Eu|ropeans, had one day beaten the rebels in a &s;kirmi&s;h, having killed &s;everal of them, and retaken about the va|lue of twenty or thirty pounds &s;terling in effects, which the negroes had pillaged from the neighbouring e&s;tates. The officer who commanded this detachment having, however, unwarrantably di&s;tributed this booty among the Indians alone, without giving a &s;hare to his &s;oldiers, di&s;gu&s;ted them &s;o much that they revolted; and de&s;ert|ing their commander, took their march for the river Oronoque through the woods, in hopes of &s;oon falling in with Spani&s;h &s;ettlements and being relieved: but how mi&s;erably were the&s;e deluded men mi&s;taken, and di&s;ap|pointed
<PB N="72" REF="105">
in their de&s;perate undertaking, by meeting the rebels or bu&s;h negroes on the &s;econd or third day of their march! The&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the &s;olemn prote&s;tations of the &s;oldiers, that they were come without any evil intention towards them, and their intreaties to let them pa&s;s by unmole&s;ted, were &s;u&s;pected of being &s;ent out to &s;py and betray them; the negroes therefore in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould lay down their arms at mercy, which the de|&s;erters having complied with, the rebels immediately dre&s;&s;ed them in one rank. Then having picked out ten or twelve to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in attending the &s;ick and wounded, repairing their arms, and trying to make gunpowder, (in which however they mi&s;carried) they condemned all the others to death, which was in&s;tantly put in execution, and above fifty of tho&s;e unfortunate men were one by one &s;hot dead upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e who were &s;aved alive by the negroes mu&s;t have &s;pun out a very melan|choly exi&s;tence among them, and indeed mo&s;t of them died within very few months after by ill treatment, hard&s;hips, and want; and when the rebels &s;urrendered them&s;elves to the Europeans at di&s;cretion, the few re|maining mi&s;erable wretches that were &s;till found alive, were directly loaded with irons, and &s;ent back from the colony of Berbice to Surinam, where three of them were executed in the town of Paramaribo, one being hanged, and two broken alive upon the rack. One of the&s;e mi|&s;erable wretches was a Frenchman, called <HI>Renauld,</HI> who &s;eemed to have imbibed the &s;entiments of the negroes
<PB N="73" REF="106">
by his re&s;idence among&s;t them. With a truly heroic &s;pirit he comforted his accomplice, who was a German, and, tied down by his &s;ide, ju&s;t ready to receive the dreadful blows, he exhorted him to pre&s;erve his cou|rage; adding, that the voyage of life would &s;oon be over, while his own bones were breaking by the execu|tioner with an iron bar.</P>
<P>The ring-leading negroes were roa&s;ted alive by half dozens in a &s;hocking manner, being chained to &s;takes in the mid&s;t of &s;urrounding flames, and expired without uttering a groan or a &s;igh. The mi&s;erable fate of &s;o many poor wretches excited great commi&s;eration; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to reflect, without the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of indignation, on a puni&s;hment &s;o &s;hocking to huma|nity, inflicted upon men, the mo&s;t of whom were drove to mi&s;conduct by tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.

<P>In 1765, a con&s;iderable degree of commotion was ex|cited in the colony, on account of a free negro woman, called <HI>Elizabeth Samp&s;on,</HI> marrying an European; &s;he was worth above 100,000 l. &s;terling, inherited from her ma&s;ter, who&s;e &s;lave &s;he had formerly been: having addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to their High Mightine&s;&s;es, her re|que&s;t was granted; and accordingly, being chri&s;tened, &s;he entered into the lawful bond of matrimony with a Mr. <HI>Zubli.</HI></P>

<P>This &s;ame year, a quantity of rock cry&s;tal was di&s;co|vered in the inland parts of Dutch Guiana.</P>

<P>The colony now &s;eemed in a pro&s;perous and flouri&s;h|ing &s;tate, &s;ince the concluding of the treaty with the Se|ramica and Ouca negroes, and every thing exhibited an a&s;pect of peace and good order. The inhabitants believed their per&s;ons and effects in perfect &s;ecurity, &s;o that no|thing was thought of but mirth and di&s;&s;ipation, which was &s;oon extended to lavi&s;hne&s;s and profu&s;ion. Suri|nam re&s;embled, indeed, a large and beautiful gar|den, &s;tocked with every thing that nature and art could produce, to make the life of man both comfortable to him&s;elf, and u&s;eful to &s;ociety: all the luxuries, as well as the nece&s;&s;aries of life, abounded; every &s;en&s;e was ap|parently intoxicated with enjoyment; and, to u&s;e the
<PB N="76" REF="109">
figurative language of a &s;acred book, Surinam was a land that flowed with milk and honey.</P>
<P>But this delu&s;ive felicity la&s;ted not long. The planter, too earne&s;t to become immediately opulent, never once con&s;idered the wretchedne&s;s of the &s;lave; while drunken|ne&s;s, luxury, and riot, became predominant in the one party, the mi&s;ery of the other proportionably increa&s;ed; nor did the de&s;truction that &s;o lately threatened them &s;eem to have the &s;malle&s;t influence on their minds; at the &s;ame time the &s;ucce&s;sful example of the Seramica and Ouca negroes &s;erved to &s;timulate the other &s;laves to re|volt, and from the&s;e complicated cau&s;es the colony was again plunged into its former aby&s;s of difficulties. The mo&s;t beautiful e&s;tates in the &s;ettlement, called Plantations, were once more &s;een, &s;ome blazing in flames, and others laid in a&s;hes; while the reeking and mangled bodies of their inhabitants were &s;cattered along the banks of the river Cottica, with their throats cut, and their effects pil|laged by their own negroes, who all fled to the woods, men, women, and children, without exception.</P>
<P>The&s;e new revolters were now di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Cottica Rebels, from the &s;pot on which their ho&s;tilities commenced; and their numbers augmenting from day to day, they &s;oon became as formidable to the &s;ettlement as the Seramica and Ouca negroes had for|merly been, and in 1772 they had nearly given the fini&s;hing blow to Surinam. At that period all was hor|ror and con&s;ternation&mdash;nothing but a general ma&s;&s;acre
<PB N="77" REF="110">
was expected by the majority of the inhabitants, who fled from their e&s;tates, and crouded to the town of Para|maribo for protection. In this &s;ituation of affairs, the inhabitants were obliged to have recour&s;e to the dan|gerous re&s;olution of forming a regiment of manumitted &s;laves, to fight again&s;t their own countrymen. When we con&s;ider the treatment which was &s;o generally exer|ci&s;ed again&s;t the &s;laves of this &s;ettlement, it mu&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e the reader to be told, that this hazardous re&s;olution had providentially the de&s;ired effect. The&s;e brave men performed wonders above expectation, in conjunction with the Colonial or Society troops, who&s;e &s;trength and numbers alone were no longer thought &s;ufficient to de|fend this &s;ettlement. But not to rely ab&s;olutely on &s;uch precarious a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the &s;ociety of Surinam made ap|plication to his &s;erene highne&s;s the Prince of Orange for a regular regiment, and our corps was in con&s;equence di&s;|patched in the manner which has been already related. As, however, the events which preceded our arrival were of the utmo&s;t importance, I &s;hall endeavour to lay be|fore my readers the mo&s;t authentic information I was able to obtain.</P>
<P>The regular troops from Europe that belong to the &s;o|ciety of Surinam, were intended to be twelve hundred men when complete, divided into two battalions, paid partly by the &s;ociety, and partly by the inhabitants: but they can ne|ver produce that number in the field, for many rea&s;ons&mdash; &s;uch as their either dying on their pa&s;&s;age, while they
<PB N="78" REF="111">
are &s;ea&s;oning to the climate, or during their dangerous and fatiguing duty in the woods and &s;wamps. Be&s;ides this number, a reinforcement of three hundred more was now &s;ent them from the town of Am&s;terdam; but of the&s;e poor wretches &s;carcely fifty were landed fit for &s;ervice; the remainder, owing to the inhumanity of their leader, Mr. N., having participated in a fate little better than that of the poor African negroes in the ve&s;&s;el of the inhuman Captain C&mdash;gw&mdash;d, who, in 1787, threw 132 living &s;laves into the &s;ea to peri&s;h. The unhappy creatures, under the command of Mr. N. were &s;tarved and tormented by unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everity; and his lieute|nant, unable to continue a witne&s;s of the tyrannical pu|ni&s;hments he inflicted, leaped from the cabin window, and terminated his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The military in Surinam are compo&s;ed of &s;everal very good and experienced officers, and well inured to the &s;ervice, but for their private men I cannot &s;ay much; they are, in fact, little better than the outca&s;ts of all na|tions: they are of all ages, &s;hapes, and &s;izes, and &s;eem by chance wafted together from all the different corners of the globe. Notwith&s;tanding this, however, it has often been found that they behave well in action, and have on many different occa&s;ions, by their bravery, been of infinite &s;ervice to this &s;ettlement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A corps of European cha&s;&s;eurs, or ri&s;le-men, was &s;ince added to the&s;e troops, after the manner of the light infantry in England.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a &s;mall corps of artillery, being part of the
<PB N="79" REF="112">
twelve hundred, which I mu&s;t acknowledge to be a very fine company in all re&s;pects. As for what they plea&s;e to call their militia, they are, a few gentlemen excepted, who command them, &s;o &s;trange a collection of ill-di&s;|ciplined rabble, that they can &s;carcely be mentioned as fighting men.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the new-rai&s;ed corps of manumitted &s;laves, though in number they amounted but to three hundred, they indeed proved ultimately of as much &s;ervice to the colony as all the others put together <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blood-hounds</HI> were al&s;o propo&s;ed, to di&s;cover and attack the rebel negroes in the woods, but never adopted, from the difficulty of their proper training, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The&s;e men were all volunteers, and in general &s;tout able young fellows, &s;elected from the different planta|tions, the owners of whom received for them their full value in money. None were accepted but tho&s;e who were reputed to be of unexceptionable character. It mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that what we Europeans call a good character, was, by the Africans, looked on as dete&s;table, particularly by tho&s;e <HI>born</HI> in the woods, who&s;e only crime con&s;i&s;ted in revenging the wrongs done to their forefathers. I have been an ocular wit|ne&s;s to a&s;toni&s;hing proofs of the fidelity of the&s;e en|franchi&s;ed &s;laves to the Europeans, and their valour again&s;t the rebel negroes.</P>
<P>Their chief leaders are three or four white men, called Conductors, to whom they pay the &s;tricte&s;t obedience:
<PB N="80" REF="113">
one or two of the&s;e attend them when they &s;et out on any enterprize of con&s;equence. Every ten privates have one captain, who commands them in the fore&s;t by the different &s;ounding of his horn, as the boat&s;wain com|mands the &s;eaman by his call, or as the cavalry of Eu|rope are directed by the &s;ound of the trumpets in the field; by which they advance, attack, retreat, &s;pread, &amp;c.: they are armed only with a firelock and &s;abre. Of both the&s;e weapons they under&s;tand the management in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner; they generally go naked, in preference, in the woods, excepting trow&s;ers, and a &s;car|let cap, the emblem of liberty, on which is their num|ber, and which, together with their parole or watch|word, which is <HI>orange,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the rebels in any action, to prevent di&s;agreeable mi&s;takes. They have, indeed, of late years, been farther di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by green uniforms.&mdash;Thus far as to the force of the colony.</P>
<P>I have already &s;tated, that the newly revolted rebels, called Cotticas, were ju&s;t preparing to give the fini&s;hing blow to Surinam; and I &s;hall now proceed to relate how this cata&s;trophe was prevented.</P>
<P>The&s;e negroes, being commanded by a de&s;perate fellow named Baron, had erected a &s;trong &s;ettlement between the river Cottica and the &s;ea-coa&s;t, whence they &s;allied forth to commit their depredations on the plantations in Cottica river, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB REF="114"><FIGURE>
<HEAD>A Coromantyn Free Negro, or Ranger, armed.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="115">I have called this &s;ettlement &s;trong, becau&s;e, like an i&s;land, it was entirely &s;urrounded by a broad unfordable mar&s;h or &s;wamp, which prevented all communication, except by private paths under water, known only to the rebels, and before which Baron had placed loaded &s;wivels, which he had plundered from the neighbouring e&s;tates: it was moreover fenced and inclo&s;ed on every &s;ide by &s;everal thou&s;and &s;trong palli&s;adoes, and was on the whole no contemptible fortification. To this &s;pot Baron gave the name of <HI>Boucon</HI> or <HI>Mouldered,</HI> intimating that it &s;hould peri&s;h in du&s;t rather than it &s;hould be taken by or &s;urrendered to the Europeans. He even pre&s;umed to &s;uppo&s;e, that it would never be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>After many marches and counter-marches, however, this ne&s;t of de&s;peradoes was at la&s;t di&s;covered, by the vi|gilance and per&s;everance of the Society troops, and the black &s;oldiers or rangers, by which name I &s;hall for the future di&s;tingui&s;h them, their &s;ervice being chiefly like that of the rangers in Virginia, who were &s;ent out again&s;t the Cherokee Indians. Another &s;ettlement of the rebels was, indeed, well known to exi&s;t in that corner of the colony, known by the name of the Lea-&s;hore, and &s;ituated between the rivers Surinam and Seramica; but hero the &s;ituation, by mar&s;hes, quagmires, mud, and water, is &s;uch, that it fortifies them from any attempts of the Europeans; nay, they are even indi&s;coverable by ne|groes, &s;o thick and impenetrable is the fore&s;t on that &s;pot, and &s;o choked with thorns, briars, and every &s;pecies of underwood.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="116">From the&s;e coverts they &s;ally forth in &s;mall parties, during the night, to rob the gardens and fields &s;ur|rounding Paramaribo, and carry off the young women, &amp;c. In this wilderne&s;s a young officer, Lieutenant Freidrecy, was lo&s;t two or three days and nights, as he went out on a &s;hooting party, and would probably never have been heard of, had not the governor, by ordering a gun to be fired at intervals, given a &s;ignal for him to find his way back, and thus re&s;tored him once more to his friends.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was determined that the rebels com|manded by Baron, at Boucon, &s;hould be be&s;ieged and rooted out, a &s;trong detachment of white and black troops were &s;ent again&s;t them, under the command of the brave Captain Myland, who was to head the fir&s;t; and Lieutenant Freidrecy, a &s;pirited young officer, with the conductors, was to lead the latter. The detachment, on their arrival at the mar&s;h, however, were obliged to encamp on its borders, not being able to pa&s;s through it on account of its unfordable depth.</P>
<P>On the di&s;covery of the troops, the bold negro Baron immediately planted a white flag within their view, which he meant not as a token of peace, but of defiance; and an ince&s;&s;ant firing in&s;tantly took place on both &s;ides, but with very little effect.</P>
<P>It was then projected to throw a fa&s;cine bridge over the mar&s;h, by the troops; but this plan, after &s;everal weeks had been &s;pent in the attempt, and a number of men
<PB N="83" REF="117">
&s;hot dead while employed upon it, was of nece&s;&s;ity laid a&s;ide. Thus every hope of pa&s;&s;ing through the mar&s;h into the fortre&s;s being fru&s;trated, and the food and am|munition being con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened, added to the lo&s;s of many men, affairs were at length arrived at &s;uch a cri&s;is, that the &s;iege mu&s;t have been broken up, and the remaining troops mu&s;t have marched back to Parama|ribo, had not the rangers, by their indefatigable efforts, and (however &s;trange to think) implacable enmity again&s;t the rebels, found out and di&s;covered to the Eu|ropeans the under-water paths of communication to Boucon, &s;everal being &s;hot and drowned in the execution of this important &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Captain Myland with the regulars, on this intelligence, now forded the &s;wamp on one &s;ide, and in&s;tantly making a feint attack on the fortre&s;s, drew Baron with all the rebels, as was expected, to its defence; while Lieutenant Freidrecy, with the rangers, having cro&s;&s;ed the &s;wamp on the other &s;ide, embraced the opportunity of leaping, with his black party, over the pali&s;adoes, &s;word in hand, without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t terrible carnage at this time en&s;ued, while &s;everal pri&s;oners were made on both &s;ides, and the for|tre&s;s of Boucon was taken; but Baron, with the greate&s;t number of the rebels, e&s;caped into the woods, having fir&s;t found means, however, to cut the throats of ten or twelve of the rangers, who had lo&s;t their way in the mar&s;h, and whom he &s;eized as they &s;tuck fa&s;t in the
<PB N="84" REF="118">
&s;wamp; and cutting off the ears, no&s;e, and lips of one of them, he left him alive in this condition to return to his friends, with whom however the mi&s;erable man &s;oon expired.</P>
<P>This Baron had formerly been the negro &s;lave of a Mr. Dahlbergh, a Swede, who on account of his abilities had advanced him to the rank of a favourite, had taught him to read and write, and bred him a ma&s;on; he had al&s;o been with his ma&s;ter in Holland, and was promi&s;ed his manumi&s;&s;ion on his return to the colony. But Mr. Dahl|bergh breaking his word with regard to his liberty, and &s;elling him to a Jew, Baron ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to work, in con&s;equence of which he was publicly flogged under the gallows. This u&s;age the negro &s;o violently re&s;ented, that from that moment he vowed revenge again&s;t all Europeans without exception; fled to the woods, where putting him&s;elf at the head of the rebels, his name be|came dreadful, and particularly &s;o to his former ma&s;ter Dahlbergh, as he &s;olemnly &s;wore that he &s;hould never die in peace till he had wa&s;hed his hands in the tyrant's blood.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who know how greatly mankind are affected by &s;elf-intere&s;t, it will not appear &s;o extraordinary, as it may to a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, that the&s;e black rangers &s;hould &s;o inveterately engage again&s;t their friends and countrymen. What will not men do to be emancipated from &s;o deplorable a &s;tate of &s;ubjection! and this emanci|pation was obtained upon more certain and advantageous
<PB N="85" REF="119">
grounds by the con&s;ent of the Europeans, than if they had ab&s;conded into the woods. Having thus once en|gaged in this &s;ervice, it is evident they mu&s;t be con|&s;idered by the other party as apo&s;tates and traitors of the blacke&s;t dye; they mu&s;t be convinced, that defeat mu&s;t not only expo&s;e them to death, but to the &s;evere&s;t tor|tures; they were therefore fighting for &s;omething more than liberty and life: &s;ucce&s;s was to bring them the mo&s;t &s;olid advantages, mi&s;carriage was to plunge them in the &s;evere&s;t mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The taking of Boucon was now greatly &s;poken of, and deemed a very &s;evere blow to the rebels; both the regu|lars and the rangers, indeed, behaved with unprecedented intrepidity and courage. Captain Myland's gallant con|duct was mo&s;t highly acknowledged; while Lieutenant Freidrecy was pre&s;ented by the Surinam Society with a beautiful &s;abre, a fu&s;ee, and a brace of pi&s;tols, mounted in &s;ilver, and ornamented with emblems expre&s;&s;ive of his merit; be&s;ides which, he obtained the rank of captain. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that on this occa&s;ion the whole de|tachment, white and black, without exception, ju&s;tly met with the fulle&s;t marks of approbation for their &s;pirited behaviour.&mdash;In this &s;tate were the public affairs of Surinam; when, in 1773, our fleet dropped anchor before the town of Paramaribo.</P>

This charming young woman I fir&s;t &s;aw at the hou&s;e of a Mr. Demelly, &s;ecretary to the court of policy, where I

daily breakfa&s;ted; and with who&s;e lady Joanna, but fif|teen years of age, was a very remarkable favourite. Rather taller than the middle &s;ize, &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t elegant &s;hape that nature can exhibit, moving her well-formed limbs with more than common gracefulne&s;s. Her face was full of native mode&s;ty, and the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed &s;weetne&s;s; her eyes, as black as ebony, were large and full of expre&s;&s;ion, be&s;peaking the goodne&s;s of her heart; with cheeks through which glowed, in &s;pite of the darkne&s;s of her complexion, a beautiful tinge of ver|million, when gazed upon. Her no&s;e was perfectly well formed, rather &s;mall; her lips a little prominent, which, when &s;he &s;poke, di&s;covered two regular rows of teeth, as white as mountain &s;now; her hair was a dark brown inclining to black, forming a beautiful globe of &s;mall ringlets, ornamented with flowers and gold &s;pangles. Round her neck, her arms, and her ancles, &s;he wore gold chains, rings and medals: while a &s;hawl of India mu&s;lin, the end of which was negligently thrown over her po|li&s;hed &s;houlders, gracefully covered part of her lovely bo&s;om, a petticoat of rich chintz alone completed her apparel. Bare-headed and bare-footed, &s;he &s;hone with double lu&s;tre, as &s;he carried in her delicate hand a beaver hat, the crown trimmed round with &s;ilver. The figure and appearance of this charming creature could not but attract my particular attention, as they did indeed that of all who beheld her; and induced me to enquire from Mrs.

<P>Having thanked Mrs. Demelly for her account of Jo|anna, in who&s;e eye glittered the precious pearl of &s;ym|pathy, I took my leave, and went to my lodging in a &s;tate of &s;adne&s;s and &s;tupefaction.

<P>When reflecting on the &s;tate of &s;lavery altogether,
<PB N="90" REF="125">
while my ears were &s;tunned with the clang of the whip, and the di&s;mal yells of the wretched negroes on whom it was exerci&s;ed, from morning till night; and con&s;ider|ing that this might one day be the fate of the unfor|tunate mulatto I have been de&s;cribing, &s;hould &s;he chance to fall into the hands of a tyrannical ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s, I could not help execrating the barbarity of Mr. D. B. for having withheld her from a fond parent, who by be|&s;towing on her a decent education and &s;ome accompli&s;h|ments, would probably have produced, in this for&s;aken plant, now expo&s;ed to every rude bla&s;t without protection, an ornament to civilized &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I became melancholy with the&s;e reflections; and in or|der to counterbalance, though in a very &s;mall degree, the general calamity of the mi&s;erable &s;laves who &s;urrounded me, I began to take more delight in the prattling of my poor negro boy Quacoo, than in all the fa&s;hionable con|ver&s;ation of the polite inhabitants of this colony: but my &s;pirits were depre&s;&s;ed, and in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours I was very ill indeed; when a cordial, a few pre&s;erved tamarinds, and a ba&s;ket of fine oranges, were &s;ent by an unknown per&s;on. This fir&s;t contributed to my relief, and lo&s;ing about twelve ounces of blood, I re|covered &s;o far, that on the fifth I was able, for change of air, to accompany a Captain Macneyl, who gave me a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to his beautiful coffee plantation, called Sporke&s;gift, in the Matapaca Creek.</P>

on our journey, embrace the opportunity of introducing a &s;hort de&s;cription of them. The tree on which this fruit is produced is about the &s;ize of a large apple-tree, and is very &s;trait, and covered with a browni&s;h-coloured bark; the twigs are &s;lender, arched, and knotty, pro|ducing leaves and a pod, which will be be&s;t known by the annexed repre&s;entation, where <HI>A</HI> is the leaf of the <HI>natural</HI> &s;ize; <HI>B</HI> the extremity of the branch; <HI>C</HI> the fruit green and unripe; <HI>D</HI> the pulp, which is brown when in perfection; and <HI>E</HI> the purple kernels or &s;tones that are in|clo&s;ed within it.

<P>We now &s;et out from Paramaribo for Sporke&s;gift, in a tent-boat or barge, rowed by eight of the be&s;t negroes belonging to Mr. Macneyl's e&s;tate; every body, as I have already mentioned, travelling by water in this colony.</P>
<P>The&s;e barges I cannot better de&s;cribe than by com|paring them with tho&s;e that accompany what is u&s;ually &s;tyled the Lord Mayor's Show on the river Thames. They are, however, &s;omewhat le&s;s, though &s;ome are very little inferior in magnificence, and are often decorated with gilded flags, filled with mu&s;icians, and abound in every convenience. They are &s;ometimes rowed by ten and even by twelve oars, and being lightly built, &s;weep along with a&s;toni&s;hing celerity. The rowers never &s;top, from the moment they &s;et out till the company is landed at the place of de&s;tination; but continue, the tide &s;erving or not, to tug night and day, &s;ometimes for twenty-four hours together, &s;inging a chorus all the time to keep up their &s;pirits.

<P><PB N="93" REF="130">We now pa&s;&s;ed a number of fine plantations, but I could not help taking particular notice of the Cacao e&s;tate, called <HI>Alkmaar,</HI> &s;ituated on the right &s;ide in row|ing up the river Comewina, which is no le&s;s con&s;pi|cuous for its beauty than for the goodne&s;s of its pro|prietor, the invaluable lady the widow Godefroy, who&s;e humanity and friend&s;hip mu&s;t always be remembered by me with gratitude.</P>
<P>At our arrival on the e&s;tate Sporke&s;gift, I had the plea&s;ure to be the &s;pectator of an in&s;tance of ju&s;tice which afforded me the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The &s;cene con&s;i&s;ted in Mr. Macneyl's turning the over|&s;eer out of his &s;ervice, and ordering him to depart from the plantation in an inferior boat, called a <HI>ponkee</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>ponkee</HI> is a flat-bottomed boat of four or &s;ix oars, &s;omething like a &s;quare-toed &s;hoe: &s;ometimes it has a tilt, and &s;ometimes not.</NOTE>, to Paramaribo, or wherever he thought proper; which was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly put in execution. The cau&s;e of his di&s;grace was having, by bad u&s;age and cruelty, cau&s;ed the death of three or four negroes. His departure was made compleatly joyful to all the &s;laves, by an holiday, which was &s;pent in fe&s;tivity, by dancing and clapping hands on a green before the dwelling-hou&s;e windows.</P>
<P>The over&s;eer's &s;entence was the more ignominious and galling, as at the time of receiving it a negro foot-boy, who was buckling his &s;hoes, was ordered back, and he was de&s;ired to buckle them him&s;elf. The &s;pirited conduct of this planter, the joy of his negroes, the &s;alubrity of the
<PB N="94" REF="131">
country air, and the ho&s;pitable manner in which we were entertained at his e&s;tate, had &s;uch an effect on my con&s;titution and my &s;pirits, that on the ninth I returned, if not recovered, at lea&s;t greatly benefited, to Paramaribo. But I &s;hould be guilty of partiality, did I not relate one in&s;tance, which throws a &s;hade over the humanity even of my friend Macneyl.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved a hand&s;ome young negro walk very lamely, while the others were capering and dancing, I inquired into the cau&s;e of his crippled appearance; when I was informed by this gentleman, that the negro having repeatedly run away from his work, he had been obliged to ham&s;tring him, which operation is performed by cutting through the large tendon above one of the heels. However &s;evere this in&s;tance of de&s;poti&s;m may appear, it is nothing when compared with &s;ome barbarities which the ta&s;k I have undertaken will oblige me, at the ex|pence of my feelings, to relate.</P>
<P>On our return to the town of Paramaribo, the only news that occurred con&s;i&s;ted in a few &s;hocking execu|tions; al&s;o that the Boreas man of war, Captain Van-de-Velde, had &s;ailed for Holland; and that Colonel Forgeoud had on the eighth, the Prince of Orange's anniver&s;ary, entertained a large company with a ball <HI>en militaire,</HI> in the officers guard-room. The mu&s;ic on this occa&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of two fiddlers only, who had the con&s;cience to make the colonel pay one hundred and twenty Dutch florins for ro&s;in and catgut.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="132">About this time I was attacked by a di&s;temper called the <HI>prickly heat,</HI> by the coloni&s;ts <HI>rootvont.</HI> It begins by the &s;kin taking a colour like &s;carlet, (occa&s;ioned by a number of &s;mall pimples) and itching inconceivably; under the garters, or any place where the circulation is impeded, the itching is almo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>With this pe&s;t all new-comers from Europe are &s;oon in|fe&s;ted; the cure is to bathe the parts with the juice of limes and water, as for the bites of gnats or mu&s;quitoes. The prickly heat is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a progno&s;tic of good health by the inhabitants; which I have rea&s;on to think true, &s;ince from that period my health and &s;pirits were perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and I was once more as happy as Paramaribo could make me.</P>
<P>At this time Colonel Fourgeoud &s;et out with a barge, to in&s;pect the &s;ituation of the rivers Comewina and Cot|tica, in ca&s;e the actual &s;ervice of our troops &s;hould &s;oon be wanted; being at his departure &s;aluted by the guns from Fort Zelandia, and by tho&s;e of the &s;hips in the roads. This compliment I acknowledge a&s;toni&s;hed me, after the coolne&s;s which took place, and was now rooted, between this gentleman and the governor of the co|lony.</P>
<P>As we were &s;till in a &s;tate of inaction, I made another ex|cur&s;ion, with a Mr. Charles Ryndorp, who rowed me in his barge to five beautiful coffee e&s;tates, and one &s;ugar plan|tation, in the Mattapaca, Paramarica, and Werapa Creeks; the de&s;cription of which I mu&s;t defer to another occa|&s;ion;

but on one of which, called Schovnort, I was the witne&s;s to a &s;cene of barbarity which I cannot help re|lating.</P>
<P>The victim of this cruelty was a fine old negro &s;lave, who having been as he thought unde&s;ervedly &s;entenced to receive &s;ome hundred la&s;hes by the lacerating whips of two negro-drivers, in the mid&s;t of the execution pulled out a knife, which, after having made a fruitle&s;s thru&s;t at his per&s;ecutor the over&s;eer, he plunged up to the haft in his own bowels, repeating the blow till he dropped down at the tyrant's feet. For this crime he was, being fir&s;t recovered, condemned to be chained to the furnace which di&s;tils the <HI>kill-devil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kill-devil</HI> is a &s;pecies of rum which is di&s;tilled from the &s;cum and dregs of &s;ugar cauldrons.

He &s;hewed me his wounds with a &s;mile of contempt, which I returned with a &s;igh and a &s;mall do|nation: nor &s;hall I ever forget the mi&s;erable man, who, like Cerberus, was loaded with irons, and chained to everla&s;ting torment. As for every thing el&s;e I ob&s;erved in this little tour, I mu&s;t acknowledge it to be elegant and &s;plendid, and my reception ho&s;pitable beyond my expectation: but the&s;e Ely&s;ian fields could not di&s;&s;ipate

the gloom which the infernal furnace had left upon my mind.</P>
<P>Of the coffee e&s;tates, that of Mr. Sims, called Lime&s;hope, was the mo&s;t magnificent, and may be deemed with ju&s;tice one of the riche&s;t in the colony. We now once more, on the &s;ixth of April, returned &s;afe to Paramaribo, where we found the We&s;terlingwerf man of war, Captain Cra&s;s, which had arrived from Plymouth in thirty-&s;even days, into which port he had put to &s;top a leak, having parted company with us, as already mentioned, off Portland, in the end of December 1772. This day, dining at the hou&s;e of my friend, Mr. Lolkens, to whom I had been, as I have &s;aid, recommended by letters, I was an eye witne&s;s of the unpardonable contempt with which negro &s;laves are treat|ed in this colony. His &s;on, a boy not more than ten years old, when &s;itting at table, gave a &s;lap in the face to a grey-headed black woman, who by accident touched his powdered hair, as &s;he was &s;erving in a di&s;h of kerry. I could not help blaming his father for overlooking the action; who told me, with a &s;mile, that the child &s;hould no longer offend me, as he was next day to &s;ail for Holland for education; to which I an&s;wered, that I thought it almo&s;t too late. At the &s;ame moment a &s;ailor pa&s;&s;ing by, broke the head of a negro with a bludgeon, for not hav|ing &s;aluted him with his hat.&mdash;Such is the &s;tate of &s;la|very, at lea&s;t in this Dutch &s;ettlement!</P>
<P>About this time, Colonel Fourgeoud made a &s;econd ex|cur&s;ion, and now departed with a barge, to explore the
<PB N="98" REF="137">
banks and &s;ituation of the river Surinam, as he had be|fore done tho&s;e of Rio Comewina and Rio Cottica.</P>
<P>At this time died Captain Barends, one of the ma&s;ters of the tran&s;ports, which were &s;till kept in commi&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be wanted for our return to Europe. Five or &s;ix &s;ailors now were buried every day, belonging to the merchant &s;hips, who&s;e lamentable fate I cannot pa&s;s by unnoticed, being actually u&s;ed wor&s;e than the negroes in this &s;corching climate, where, be&s;ides rowing large flat-bottomed barges up and down the rivers, day and night, for coffee, &s;ugar, &amp;c. and being expo&s;ed to the burning &s;un and heavy rains, and be&s;ides &s;towing the above commodities in a hold as hot as an oven, they are obliged to row every up&s;tart planter to his e&s;tate at a call, which &s;aves the gentleman &s;o many negroes, and for which they receive in return nothing&mdash;many times not &s;o much as a mouthful of meat and drink; palliating hun|ger and thir&s;t, by begging from the &s;laves a few bananas or plantains, eating oranges and drinking water, which in a little time relieves them from every complaint, by &s;hipping them off to eternity. In every part of the colony they are no better treated, but, like hor&s;es, they mu&s;t (hav|ing unloaded the ve&s;&s;els) drag the commodities to the di&s;|tant &s;tore-hou&s;es, being bathed in &s;weat, and bullied with bad language, &s;ometimes with blows; while a few negroes are ordered to attend, but not to work, by the direction of their ma&s;ters, which many would willingly do to relieve the drooping &s;ailors, to whom this u&s;age mu&s;t be exceedingly
<PB N="99" REF="138">
di&s;heartening and galling. The planters even employ tho&s;e men to paint their hou&s;es, clean their &s;a&s;h-windows, and do numberle&s;s other menial &s;ervices, for which a &s;eaman was never intended. All this is done to &s;ave the work of their negroes; while by this u&s;age thou&s;ands are &s;wept to the grave, who in the line of their profe&s;&s;ion alone might have lived for many years; nor dare the We&s;t India Captains to refu&s;e their men, with|out incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the planters, and &s;eeing their &s;hips rot in the harbour without a loading;&mdash;nay, I have heard a &s;ailor fervently wi&s;h he had been born a ne|gro, and beg to be employed among&s;t them in cultivat|ing a coffee plantation.</P>
<P>I now took an early opportunity to enquire of Mrs. Demelly what was become of the amiable Joanna; and was informed that her lady, Mrs. D. B. had e&s;caped to Holland on board the Boreas man-of-war, under the protection of Captain Van-de-Velde, and that her young mulatto was now at the hou&s;e of her aunt, a free woman, whence &s;he expected hourly to be &s;ent up to the e&s;tate Fauconberg, friendle&s;s, and at the mercy of &s;ome unprin|cipled over&s;eer appointed by the creditors, who had now taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plantation and &s;tock, till the whole &s;hould be &s;old to pay the &s;everal &s;ums due to them by Mr. D. B.&mdash;Good God!&mdash;I flew to the &s;pot in &s;earch of poor Joanna: I found her bathed in tears. &mdash; She gave me &s;uch a look&mdash;ah! &s;uch a look!&mdash;From that moment I determined to be her protector again&s;t every in&s;ult, and per&s;evered, as &s;hall be &s;een in the &s;equel.&mdash;Here, reader, let my youth, blended with extreme &s;en&s;ibility, plead my

<P>I next ran to the hou&s;e of my friend Lolkens, who happened to be the admini&s;trator of Fauconberg e&s;tate; and a&s;king his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I intimated to him my &s;trange determination of purcha&s;ing and educating Joanna.</P>
<P>Having recovered from his &s;urprize, after gazing at me &s;ilently for &s;ome time, an interview at once was pro|po&s;ed; and the beauteous &s;lave, accompanied by a female relation, was produced trembling in my pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Reader, if you have peru&s;ed the tale of <HI>Lavinia</HI> with plea&s;ure, though the &s;cene admits of no compari&s;on, re|ject not the hi&s;tory of Joanna with contempt.&mdash;It now proved to be &s;he who had privately &s;ent me the cordial and the oranges in March, when I was nearly expiring, and which &s;he now mode&s;tly acknowledged
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was in gratitude for my expre&s;&s;ions of compa&s;&s;ion re&s;pecting her &s;ad &s;ituation;"</Q>
with &s;ingular delicacy, however, &s;he rejected every propo&s;al of becoming mine upon any terms. She was con&s;cious, &s;he &s;aid,

In which &s;entiments Joanna firmly per&s;i&s;ting, &s;he was immediately permitted to withdraw, and return to the hou&s;e of her aunt; while I could only intreat of

Mr. Lolkens his generous protection for her, and that &s;he might at lea&s;t for &s;ome time be &s;eparated from the other &s;laves, and continue at Paramaribo; and in this re|que&s;t his humanity was induced to indulge me.</P>
<P>On the 30th the news arrived, that the <HI>rangers,</HI> hav|ing di&s;covered a rebel village, had attacked it, and car|ried off three pri&s;oners, leaving four others dead upon the &s;pot, who&s;e right hands, chopped off and barbecued or &s;moke-dried, they had &s;ent to the governor of Para|maribo as a proof of their valour and fidelity.</P>
<P>On receiving this intelligence, Colonel Fourgeoud im|mediately left the river Surinam, where he &s;till was, and on the fir&s;t of May returned to town, in expectation of his regiment being employed on actual &s;ervice, but there the bu&s;ine&s;s ended; and we &s;till, to our utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment, were allowed to linger away our time, each agree|ably to his own peculiar fancy. On the 4th of May, the rangers however were reviewed in the Fort Zelandia, at which ceremony I was pre&s;ent, and mu&s;t confe&s;s that this corps of black &s;oldiers had a truly manly appear|ance: warriors who&s;e determined and open a&s;pect could not but give me the &s;atisfaction of a &s;oldier in beholding them. They here once more received the thanks of the governor for their manly behaviour and faithful con|duct, particularly at the taking of <HI>Boucon</HI>; be&s;ides which, they were entertained with a rural fea&s;t, at the public expence, at Paramaribo, to which were al&s;o invited their families; and at which fea&s;t &s;everal re&s;pectable people of both &s;exes made their appearance with plea&s;ure, to wit|ne&s;s the happine&s;s of their &s;able friends, the day being
<PB N="102" REF="141">
&s;pent in mirth and conviviality, without the lea&s;t di&s;turb|ance, nay even with decorum and propriety, to the great &s;atisfaction of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The We&s;terlingwerf, Captain Cra&s;s, now left the river al&s;o, bound for Holland, but fir&s;t for the colony of De|merary. Thus both &s;hips of war having &s;ailed without us, there was &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e we were &s;oon to be employed on actual &s;ervice. There were many motives, indeed, for wi&s;hing either that this might be the ca&s;e, or that we might &s;peedily be permitted to return to Europe. Not only our officers, but our privates, began to feel the debilitating effects of the climate, and many, of that continued debauchery &s;o common in all ranks in this &s;ettlement: and as hard labour and bad treatment con|&s;tantly killed the poor &s;ailors, &s;o now our common &s;oldiers fell the victims of idlene&s;s and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and died frequently &s;ix or &s;even in a day; whence it is evident to demon&s;tration, that all exce&s;&s;es, of whatever kind, are mortal to Europeans in the climate of Guiana.</P>
<P>But men will give le&s;&s;ons which they do not them|&s;elves ob&s;erve. Thus, notwith&s;tanding my former re|&s;olution of living retired, I again relap&s;ed into the vortex of di&s;&s;ipation. I became a member of a drink|ing club, I partook of all polite and impolite amu&s;e|ments, and plunged into every extravagance without exception. I did not, however, e&s;cape without the pu|ni&s;hment I de&s;erved. I was &s;eized &s;uddenly with a dreadful fever; and &s;uch was its violence, that in a few days I was no more expected to recover. In this
<PB N="103" REF="142">
&s;ituation I lay in my hammock until the 17th, with only a &s;oldier and my black boy to attend me, and without any other friend: &s;ickne&s;s being univer&s;al among the new-comers to this country, and every one of our corps having &s;o much to do to take care of them&s;elves, neglect was an inevitable con&s;equence, even among the neare&s;t acquaintance. This, however, is a cen&s;ure which does not apply to the inhabitants, who perhaps are the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable people on the globe to Europeans. The&s;e philanthropi&s;ts not only &s;upply the &s;ick with a va|riety of cordials at the &s;ame time, but crowd their apart|ments with innumerable condolers, who from morning till night continue pre&s;cribing, in&s;i&s;ting, bewailing, and lamenting, friend and &s;tranger without exception; and this la&s;ts until the patient becomes delirious, and expires. Such mu&s;t inevitably have been my ca&s;e, between the two extremes of neglect and importunity, had it not been for the happy intervention of poor Joanna, who one morning entered my apartment, to my un&s;peakable joy and &s;urprize, accompanied by one of her &s;i&s;ters. She in|formed me that &s;he was acquainted with my forlorn &s;itua|tion; that if I &s;till entertained for her the &s;ame good opinion, her only reque&s;t was, that &s;he might wait upon me till I &s;hould be recovered. I indeed gratefully ac|cepted her offer; and by her unremitting care and atten|tion had the good fortune &s;o far to regain my health and &s;pirits, as to be able, in a few days after, to take an airing in Mr. Kennedy's carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="143">Till this time I had chiefly been Joanna's friend; but now I began to feel I was her captive. I renewed my wild propo&s;als of purcha&s;ing, educating, and tran&s;|porting her to Europe; which, though offered with the mo&s;t perfect &s;incerity, were, by her, rejected once more, with this humble declaration:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am born a low contemptible &s;lave. Were you to treat me with too much attention, you mu&s;t degrade your&s;elf with all your friends and relations; while the purcha&s;e of my freedom you will find expen|&s;ive, difficult, and apparently impo&s;&s;ible. Yet though a &s;lave, I have a &s;oul, I hope, not inferior to that of an European; and blu&s;h not to avow the regard I retain for you, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed me &s;o much above all others of my unhappy birth. You have, Sir, pitied me; and now, independent of every other thought, I &s;hall have pride in throwing my&s;elf at your feet, till fate &s;hall part us, or my conduct become &s;uch as to give you cau&s;e to bani&s;h me from your pre|&s;ence."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;he uttered with a down-ca&s;t look, and tears drop|ping on her heaving bo&s;om, while &s;he held her compa|nion by the hand.</P>
<P>From that in&s;tant this excellent creature was mine;&mdash; nor had I ever after cau&s;e to repent of the &s;tep I had taken, as will more particularly appear in the cour&s;e of this narrative.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="144">I cannot omit to record, that having purcha&s;ed for her pre&s;ents to the value of twenty guineas, I was the next day greatly a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee all my gold returned upon my table; the charming Joanna having carried every article back to the merchants, who cheerfully returned her the money.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your generous intentions alone, Sir, (&s;he &s;aid) were &s;ufficient: but allow me to tell you, that I cannot help con&s;idering any &s;uperfluous expence on my account as a diminution of that good opinion which I hope you have, and will ever entertain, of my di&s;intere&s;ted di&s;|po&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P>Such was the language of a &s;lave, who had &s;imple nature only for her in&s;tructor, the purity of who&s;e &s;en|timents &s;tood in need of no comment, and the&s;e I was now determined to improve by every care.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now only add, that a regard for her &s;uperior virtues, &s;o &s;ingular among&s;t her ca&s;t, gratitude for her particular attention to me, and the plea&s;ure of producing to the world &s;uch an accompli&s;hed character under the appearance of a &s;lave, could alone embolden me to ri&s;k the cen&s;ure of my readers, by intruding on them this &s;ubject: let this be my apology, and if it be accepted but by few, I &s;hall not be inclined to complain.</P>
<P>In the evening I vi&s;ited Mr. Demelly, who, with his lady, congratulated me on my recovery from &s;ickne&s;s; and at the &s;ame time, however &s;trange it may appear to many readers, they, with a &s;mile, wi&s;hed me joy of

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Account of a dreadful Execution&mdash;Fluctuating State of political Affairs&mdash;Short Glimp&s;e of Peace&mdash;An Officer &s;hot dead; his whole Party cut to Pieces, and the general Alarm revived throughout the Colony.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 21&s;t of May our Lieutenant Colonel Lant|man died, and a number of our officers lay &s;ick.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI.</NOTE></P>
<P>In&s;tead of gaiety and di&s;&s;ipation, di&s;ea&s;e and mortality now began to rage among&s;t us; and the deva&s;tation in|crea&s;ed from day to day among the private men, in a mo&s;t alarming proportion. The remains of the decea&s;ed officer were interred with military honours, in the centre of the Fortre&s;s Zelandia, where all criminals are im|pri&s;oned, and all field officers buried. At this place I was not a little &s;hocked, to &s;ee the captive rebel negroes and others clanking their chains, and roa&s;ting plantains and yams upon the &s;epulchres of the dead; they pre|&s;ented to my imagination, the image of a number of diabolical fiends in the &s;hape of African &s;laves, torment|ing the &s;ouls of their European per&s;ecutors. From the&s;e gloomy man&s;ions of de&s;pair, on this day, &s;even captive negroes were &s;elected, who being led by a few &s;oldiers to the place of execution, which is in the Savannah, where the &s;ailors and &s;oldiers are interred, &s;ix were hanged, and one broken alive upon the rack, with an iron
<PB N="108" REF="147">
bar; be&s;ides which a white man was &s;courged before the court hou&s;e, by the public executioner, who is in this country always a black. The circum&s;tance which led me to take particular notice of this affair, was the &s;hame|ful inju&s;tice of &s;hewing a partiality to the European, who ought to have been better informed, by letting him e&s;|cape with only a &s;light corporal puni&s;hment; while the poor uneducated African for the &s;ame crime, viz. &s;tealing money out of the Town Hall, lo&s;t his life under the mo&s;t excruciating torments, which he &s;upported without heav|ing a &s;igh or making a complaint; while one of his com|panions with the rope about his neck, and ju&s;t on the point of being turned off, uttered a laugh of con|tempt at the magi&s;trates who attended the execution. I ought not in this place to omit, that the negro who flogged the white man inflicted the puni&s;hment with the greate&s;t marks of commi&s;eration. The&s;e tran&s;actions almo&s;t induced me to decide between the Europeans and Africans in this colony, that the fir&s;t were the greater barbarians of the two&mdash;a name which tarni&s;hes Chri&s;|tianity, and is be&s;towed on them in too many corners of the globe, with what real degree of ju&s;tice I will not take on me to determine.</P>
<P>Having te&s;tified how much I was hurt at the cruelty of the above execution, and &s;urprized at the intrepidity with which the negroes bore their puni&s;hment, a decent looking man &s;tepped up to me,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, (&s;aid he) you are but a new-comer from Europe, and know very little
<PB N="109" REF="148">
about the African &s;laves, or you would te&s;tify both le&s;s feeling and &s;urprize. Not long ago, (continued he) I &s;aw a black man &s;u&s;pended alive from a gallows, by the ribs, between which, with a knife, was fir&s;t made an inci&s;ion, and then clinched an iron hook with a chain; in this manner he kept alive three days, hanging with his head and feet downwards, and catch|ing with his tongue the drops of water (it being in the rainy &s;ea&s;on) that were flowing down his bloated brea&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding all this he never complained, and even upbraided a negro for crying while he was flogged below the gallows, by calling out to him&mdash;You man?&mdash;<HI>Da cay fa&s;y?</HI> Are you a man? you behave like a boy. Shortly after which he was knocked on the head by the commi&s;erating &s;entry, who &s;tood over him, with the butt end of his mu&s;ket."</Q>
&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Another negro, (&s;aid he) I have &s;een quartered alive; who, after four &s;trong hor&s;es were fa&s;tened to his legs and arms, and after having had iron &s;prigs driven home underneath every one of his nails on hands and feet, without a mo|tion, he fir&s;t a&s;ked a dram, and then bid them pull away, without a groan; but what afforded us the greate&s;t en|tertainment, (continued he) were the fellow's jokes, by de&s;iring the executioner to drink before him, in ca&s;e there &s;hould chance to be poi&s;on in the gla&s;s, and bid|ding him take care of his hor&s;es, le&s;t any of them &s;hould happen to &s;trike backwards. As for old men being broken upon the rack, and young women roa&s;ted
<PB N="110" REF="149">
alive chained to &s;takes, there can nothing be more common in this colony."</Q>
&mdash;I was petrified at the in|human detail; and breaking away with execrations from this diabolical &s;cene of laceration, made the be&s;t of my way home to my own lodgings.</P>
<P>On the 24th, having received a &s;upply of provi&s;ions from Holland, and ab&s;olutely doing no &s;ervice in the colony, it was univer&s;ally re&s;olved that we &s;hould pro|ceed home; our regiment, notwith&s;tanding its being partly paid by the United Provinces, &s;till being exceed|ingly chargeable to the &s;ociety and the inhabitants, who, in conjunction, paid all other expences; thus, in the hopes of &s;ailing in the middle of June, the tran&s;ports were ordered a &s;econd time to wood, water, and make all other nece&s;&s;ary preparations.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay nothing of what I felt on this occa&s;ion; I continued, however, not long in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e; for the following day intelligence being brought that a plantation was demoli&s;hed, and the over&s;eers murdered by the rebels, our &s;tay was prolonged a &s;econd time, at the reque&s;t of the governor him&s;elf and inhabitants; and, in con&s;equence, the three tran&s;ports, which had &s;ince February the 9th been kept waiting at a great expence, were finally put out of commi&s;&s;ion, and the provi&s;ions &s;towed at the head-quarters in a temporary &s;tore-hou&s;e erected for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The minds of the people began now to be quieted, finding at la&s;t that the troops were in earne&s;t preparing
<PB REF="150">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A Negro hung alive by the Ribs to a Gallows.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="111" REF="151">
for actual &s;ervice, a circum&s;tance greatly, indeed, to be lamented as to the occa&s;ion, but certainly much better for the colony, than to let the regiment linger away an idle life at Paramaribo.</P>
<P>Thus our warlike preparations for &s;ome days pro|ceeded, and our marines appeared in excellent &s;pirits; when again, on the 7th of June, to our unutterable &s;urprize, we were for the third time officially ac|quainted, that things feeming quiet, and pre&s;uming that tranquillity was at la&s;t re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the colony of Surinam had no farther occa&s;ion for our &s;ervices; the&s;e fluctating councils did not fail to produce much di&s;content among the military, as well as the inhabi|tants; and cabals were formed, which threatened to break out into a civil conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Some charged the governor with being jealous of the unlimited power which was ve&s;ted in Colonel Fourgeoud, who was al&s;o by many others blamed as abu&s;ing that power, and as not treating the governor with that civility, which he might have evinced without le&s;&s;ening his own con&s;equence. Thus, while one party acknowledged us to be the bulwark of the &s;ettlement, by keeping the rebels in awe, the oppo&s;ition he&s;itated not to call us the locu&s;ts of Egypt, who were come to devour the fruits of the colony.</P>
<P>Without entering into the merits of the que&s;tion, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that our life was rendered very uncom|fortable, and a great number of us could not help thinking,
<PB N="112" REF="152">
that between the two parties we were but ill treated. This &s;ame day, while at dinner on board a Dutch ve&s;&s;el in the roads, the company were alarmed by the mo&s;t tre|mendous claps of thunder I ever heard in my life. On our &s;ide of the continent, &s;everal negroes and cattle were killed by lightning; while, on the other &s;ide, nearly at the &s;ame time, the city of Guatimala, in Old Mexico, was &s;wallowed up by an earthquake, by which eight thou&s;and families are &s;aid to have in&s;tantly peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 11th, the &s;hips, being taken again into commi&s;|&s;ion, were ordered with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to prepare for our final departure, and every one was making him&s;elf ready for the voyage.</P>
<P>Being thus apparently di&s;engaged from military &s;er|vice, I received a polite invitation from a Mr. Campbel, who was lodged with a Mr. Kerry at my friend Ken|nedy's, to accompany him on a vi&s;it to the i&s;land of To|bago, where I might recruit my debilitated health and dejected &s;pirits. His plan was to return with me by the Leeward I&s;lands to Europe. It was, indeed, to me a mo&s;t agreeable offer, all things con&s;idered, and I &s;hould cer|tainly with plea&s;ure have accepted it, had not my appli|cation to Colonel Fourgeoud been prevented by a fre&s;h alarm, which was received on the 15th. The &s;ub&s;tance of this was no le&s;s, than that an officer of the Society troops had been &s;hot dead by the rebels, and his whole party, con|&s;i&s;ting of about thirty men, entirely cut to pieces. So alarm|ing a piece of intelligence could not fail to throw the whole
<PB N="113" REF="153">
colony once more into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion and con&s;ter|nation; the above gentleman, who&s;e name was Lepper, and only a lieutenant, was in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of this misfortune, by his impetuo&s;ity and intrepidity, totally unregulated by temper or conduct <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman formerly belonged to the life-guards in Holland, from which he fled, after thru&s;ting his antagoni&s;t through the heart with his &s;word in a duel.</NOTE>; but as this cen&s;ure in general terms may appear &s;evere, it be|comes in &s;ome degree incumbent on me to relate the particulars.</P>
<P>The period when this unhappy event took place, was that which, in the language of the colony, is termed the <HI>&s;hort-day &s;ea&s;on.</HI> During this, Mr. Lepper having been informed that between the rivers Patamaca and Upper Cormootibo, a village of negroes had been di&s;covered by the rangers &s;ome time before; he determined with his &s;mall party, which was only a detachment from the Pata|maca po&s;t, to &s;ally through the woods and attack them. But the rebels being apprized of his intentions by their &s;pies, which they con&s;tantly employ, immediately marched out to receive him; in his way they laid them&s;elves in am|bu&s;h, near the borders of a deep mar&s;h, through which the &s;oldiers were to pa&s;s to the rebel &s;ettlement. No &s;ooner had the unfortunate men got into the &s;wamp and up to their arm-pits, than their black enemies ru&s;hed out from under cover, and &s;hot them dead at their lei&s;ure in the water,
<PB N="114" REF="154">
while they were unable to return the fire more than once, their &s;ituation preventing them from re-loading their mu&s;quets. Their gallant commander, being imprudently di&s;tingui&s;hed by a gold-laced hat, was &s;hot through the head in the fir&s;t on&s;et. The few that &s;crambled out of the mar&s;h upon the banks were immediately put to death in the mo&s;t barbarous manner, except five or &s;ix, who were taken pri&s;oners and carried alive to the &s;ettle|ment of the rebels. The melancholy fate of the&s;e un|fortunate men, I &s;hall, in a proper place, de&s;cribe, as I had it &s;ince from tho&s;e that were eye-witne&s;&s;es of it.</P>
<P>The intelligence had &s;carcely reached Paramaribo, than the whole town was in a tumult; &s;ome parties were &s;o ve|hement that they were ready to tear the governor and council to pieces, for having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Colonel Fourgeoud with his regiment; while others ingenuou&s;ly declared, that if we were intended for no further u&s;e than we had hitherto been, our company might without regret be di&s;|pen&s;ed with. All this could not but be exceedingly gal|ling to our officers, who wi&s;hed nothing more than to be employed on actual &s;ervice for the advantage of the colony. On the other &s;ide, mo&s;t bitter lampoons were &s;pread through the town again&s;t the governor and his council; libels of &s;uch a black and inflammatory nature, that no le&s;s than a thou&s;and gold ducats were offered as a reward for the di&s;covery of their author, with a promi&s;e of concealing the name of the informer if he required it: but the whole was to no purpo&s;e, and neither author nor
<PB N="115" REF="155">
informer made their appearance; the general clamour however &s;till continuing, the governor and council were forced a third time to petition us to remain in Surinam, and to protect the di&s;tracted colony. To this petition we once more conde&s;cended to li&s;ten, and the &s;hips were actually a third time put out of commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We, however, &s;till continued doing nothing, to the un|&s;peakable &s;urprize of every per&s;on concerned: the only part on duty, hitherto, having con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ubaltern's guard at the head-quarters, to protect the chief, his co|lours, his &s;tore-hou&s;es, pigs and poultry, which guard regularly mounted every day at half pa&s;t four o'clock, and another on board the tran&s;ports, until the provi&s;ions had been &s;towed on &s;hore in the magazines. This, a few field-days excepted, when the &s;oldiers were drilled for pomp alone in a burning &s;un till they fainted, comprehend|ed the whole of our military manoeuvres. But I perceive the reader is already impatient for &s;ome information re|&s;pecting the&s;e two extraordinary men, who, from their inveteracy and oppo&s;ition to each other, as well as from other cau&s;es, were the authors of the&s;e unaccountable and fluctuating proceedings; and the outlines of the&s;e two characters may perhaps a&s;&s;i&s;t in unravelling the my&s;tery.</P>
<P>As the ingredients of flattery or fear make but a &s;mall part of that man's compo&s;ition who pre&s;umes to give them, and who pretends perfectly to have known both,
<PB N="116" REF="156">
the reader may depend on having them painted in their true original colours, however &s;trong the &s;hades.</P>
<P>Governor Nep&s;eu was &s;aid to be rather a man of &s;en&s;e than of learning, and was wholly indebted to his art and addre&s;s, for having ri&s;en to his pre&s;ent dignity from &s;weeping the hall of the court-hou&s;e. By the &s;ame means he was enabled, from nothing, to accumulate a fortune, by &s;ome computed at no le&s;s than eight thou&s;and pounds &s;terling annually, and to command re&s;pect from all ranks of people, no per&s;on ever daring to attack him but at a di&s;tance. His deportment was affable, but iron|ical, without ever lo&s;ing the command of his temper, which gave him the appearance of a man of fa&s;hion, and rendered his influence almo&s;t unbounded. He was generally known by the appellation of Reynard, and was mo&s;t certainly a fox of too much artifice to be run down by all the hounds in the colony.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud was almo&s;t exactly the rever&s;e of this portrait. He was impetuous, pa&s;&s;ionate, &s;elf-&s;uffi|cient, and revengeful: he was not cruel to individuals, but was a tyrant to the generality, and cau&s;ed the death of hundreds by his &s;ordid avarice and oppre&s;&s;ion. With all this he was partial, ungrateful, and confu&s;ed; but a mo&s;t indefatigable man in bearing hard&s;hips and in braving dangers, not exceeded by Columbus him&s;elf, which, like a true buccaneer, he &s;u&s;tained with the mo&s;t heroic courage, patience, and per&s;everance. Though un|conquerably
<PB N="117" REF="157">
har&s;h and &s;evere to his officers, he was however not wanting in affability to the private &s;oldiers. He had read, but had no education to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in dige&s;ting what he read. In &s;hort, few men could talk better, but on mo&s;t occa&s;ions few could act wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Such were the characters of our commanders, while the oppo&s;ition of two &s;uch men to each other could not fail to produce unhappine&s;s to the troops, and ope|rated as a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for the fluctuating &s;tate of political affairs in this dejected colony.</P>
<P>As we &s;till continued totally inactive, I am nece&s;&s;arily deprived of the plea&s;ure of relating any of our hero's warlike atchievements.&mdash;To relieve the &s;amene&s;s of the narrative, I therefore take the liberty of de&s;cribing one of his favourites.&mdash;This was no other than a bird called the <HI>toucan,</HI> and in Surinam <HI>banarabeck</HI> or <HI>cojacai,</HI> either from its bill having &s;ome re&s;emblance to that fruit, or from its being accu&s;tomed to feed on it, and perhaps from both. This animal the colonel kept hopping tame among&s;t his poultry.</P>
<P>The toucan is not larger than a tame pigeon, and yet its beak is no le&s;s than &s;ix inches in length, if not more. It is &s;haped like a jackdaw, carrying its tail almo&s;t per|pendicular, except when it flies: its colour is black, ex|cept a little white under the throat and brea&s;t, which is bordered with red in the form of a cre&s;cent rever&s;ed, and a few feathers above and under its tail, &s;ome white and &s;ome crim&s;on. The head is large, with a bluei&s;h ring
<PB N="118" REF="158">
round the eyes, of which the iris is yellow, and its a&s;h|coloured toes are much like tho&s;e of a parrot. Its re|markable beak de&s;erves the mo&s;t particular attention, which is &s;errated, and of a &s;ize utterly di&s;proportioned to its body. This beak, however, which is arched, is as thin as parchment, and con&s;equently very light; it is yellow on the top, and on the &s;ides of a beautiful deep orange, inclo&s;ing a tongue which bears a &s;trong re&s;emblance to a feather. The toucan feeds on fruit, e&s;pecially pepper, and is very dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here al&s;o take the opportunity to de&s;cribe an|other tame bird, which I &s;aw with plea&s;ure at the hou&s;e of Mr. Lolkens, and which I take to be what we call the fly-catcher; they denominate it in this country <HI>&s;un|fowlo,</HI> becau&s;e when it extends its wings, which it fre|quently does, there appears, on the interior part of each wing, the mo&s;t beautiful repre&s;entation of a &s;un. This bird is about the &s;ize of a woodcock, and of a golden colour, but &s;peckled; its legs are very long, and al&s;o its &s;lender bill, which is perfectly &s;trait, and very pointed. With this it darts at the flies while they creep, with &s;uch wonderful dexterity and quickne&s;s, that it never mi&s;&s;es the object, which &s;eems to con&s;titute its principal food; and this property renders it both u&s;eful and entertaining. This bird might, with &s;ome degree of propriety, be &s;tyled the perpetual motion, its body making a continual movement, and its tail keeping time like the pendulum of a clock.</P>

<P>One bird more I &s;hall only mention in this place, which may be con&s;idered as the rival of the mock-bird, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Caribbean wren.</HI> This bird, which is called by the Su|rinam coloni&s;ts <HI>Gado fowlo,</HI> or the bird of God, probably from its familiarity, inoffen&s;ivene&s;s, and its delightful mu&s;ic, is rather larger than the Engli&s;h wren, which in its plumage it much re&s;embles; it frequently perches upon the window-&s;hutters with the familiarity of the robin. From its enchanting warbling, it has been ho|noured by many with the name of the South American nightingale.&mdash;But to proceed with my narrative.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t died Mr. Renard, one of our be&s;t &s;urgeons, who was buried the &s;ame afternoon, a proce&s;s quite ne|ce&s;&s;ary in this hot country, where putrefaction &s;o in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly takes place, and more e&s;pecially when the
<PB N="120" REF="161">
patient dies of a putrid fever, which is in this country extremely frequent. This dreadful di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appears by bilious vomiting, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, and a yellowi&s;h ca&s;t of the countenance and eyes; and unle&s;s proper re|medies be immediately applied, the di&s;temper becomes fatal, and certain death in a few days is the con&s;equence. The belly-hatty, or dry-gripes, by &s;ome compared to the Devon&s;hire cholic, is al&s;o a common complaint in this country, and not only cau&s;es excruciating pains, but is exceedingly dangerous. This al&s;o had now attacked a great number of our people. As to the cau&s;es of this di&s;order I can give no account. The prevailing &s;ymptom is an ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, which they endeavour to re|move by a quantity of ca&s;tor oil taken internally, and al&s;o injected by the rectum.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, lamentable to ob&s;erve the &s;tate to which we were already reduced, from a corps of the fine&s;t, healthie&s;t young men that ever &s;ailed from Europe, with blooming fre&s;h complexions, now changed to the &s;allow colour of a drum-head. It was no alleviation of the calamity to reflect, that all this wa&s;te of life and health had been hitherto to no purpo&s;e; though &s;ome per&s;ons cho&s;e to report, that the whole was no more than a po|litical &s;cheme to have another regiment added to the war|e&s;tabli&s;hment in Holland, as Colonel De Salve's marines had been before: but to this others gave but very little credit.</P>
<P>Of the ho&s;pitality of the country at lea&s;t we could not
<PB N="121" REF="162">
complain, &s;ince this was actually one of the principal &s;ources of our misfortunes, and we were likely in a few months to be care&s;&s;ed to death by the civilities of the men, and the kindne&s;s of the ladies: a circum&s;tance which rendered Surinam a real <HI>Capua</HI> to the&s;e brave fellows.</P>
<P>On the 27th of June, the gentleman-like Lieutenant-Colonel Baron de Ger&s;dorph died, much regretted indeed by every per&s;on; while the grim King of Terrors, con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly beginning at the head of the corps with the field officers, could not fail to afford &s;ome con&s;olation to the inferior gentry who &s;ucceeded to their places, by the appointment of Colonel Fourgeoud, the commander in chief, who him&s;elf exhibited as yet no &s;ymptoms of mor|tality. Major Becquer was now made lieutenant-colonel, and a Captain Rockaph advanced to the rank of major.</P>
<P>The European animals that live in this country are no le&s;s debilitated and diminutive than the human &s;pecies. The oxen, for in&s;tance, are very &s;mall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I am a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee con|tradicted by Dr. Bancroft, who &s;ays they improve in South America, while one bullock of Smithfield market a&s;&s;uredly weighs down two of the large&s;t in Gui|ana.</NOTE>, and their beef not near &s;o delicate as it is in Europe, owing probably to their perpetual per&s;piration, and the coar&s;ene&s;s of the gra&s;s on which they feed, which is not &s;o good as that of the &s;alt mar&s;hes in Somer&s;et&s;hire. On the banks of the Oronoque the oxen run wild, and are &s;old by the Spa|niards for two dollars per head. A &s;ingle piece of ready-roa&s;ted
<PB N="122" REF="163">
beef is often &s;ent from Europe to Guiana as a mo&s;t valuable and delicate pre&s;ent. The manner of pre|&s;erving the meat for this long voyage, when roa&s;ted, is by putting it in a block-tin box or canni&s;ter; then filling up the empty &s;pace with gravy or dripping till it is perfectly covered over; after which the box mu&s;t be made fa&s;t and &s;oldered round about, &s;o that neither air nor water can penetrate: by this means I was told it may be with &s;afety carried round the globe.</P>
<P>The &s;heep in this country are &s;o &s;mall that, when &s;kinned, they &s;eem not larger than young lambs in Whitechapel market; they have no horns nor wool, but &s;trait hair, and are to an European but very indifferent eating: the more &s;o, &s;ince all beef, mutton, &amp;c. mu&s;t be con&s;umed the &s;ame day that it is killed, which cau&s;es it to eat though, while keeping it longer expo&s;es it to putrefaction. Neither of the&s;e animals are natural to Guiana: the breed has been imported from the Old Continent. So al&s;o was the breed of the hog, but with far better &s;ucce&s;s; for the&s;e animals, in my opinion, thrive better in South America than in Europe. The hogs here are large, fat, good, and plentiful; as in Eng|land, they feed on almo&s;t every thing that is eatable, and on the e&s;tates are often fattened with green pine|apples, a fruit which grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in this climate, and of which they are exceedingly fond. As for the poultry, nothing can thrive better; the common fowls are here as good and as plenty as in any country, but
<PB N="123" REF="164">
&s;maller, and their eggs differ in &s;hape, being more &s;harp|pointed. A &s;maller &s;pecies of the dunghill kind, with rumpled inverted feathers, &s;eems natural to Guiana, be|ing reared in the inland parts of the country by the Indians or natives. The turkeys are very fine, and &s;o are the gee&s;e, but the ducks are excellent, being of the large Mu&s;covy &s;pecies, with crim&s;on pearls betwixt the beak and the head: the&s;e are here juicy, fat, and in great plenty.</P>
<P>After the various delays we had experienced, the reader will be &s;urprized to learn that the hour of action at la&s;t arrived, and all the officers and men were ordered to be ready at a minute's warning to &s;et out on actual &s;ervice, though our little corps was already melted down from five hundred and thirty able men to about three-fourths of that number, by death and &s;ickne&s;s, the ho&s;|pital being crouded by invalids of every kind. The lo&s;s of &s;o large a proportion of men was &s;upplied in a man|ner that will appear extraordinary to a European.</P>
<P>There were two negroes, one called <HI>Okera,</HI> the other <HI>Gow&s;ary,</HI> two de&s;peradoes, who had both been rebel cap|tains in the colony of Berbice, and who, for taking <HI>Atta</HI> their chief, and delivering him to the governor of that &s;ettlement, had received their pardon. By the&s;e two men the mo&s;t inhuman murders had been committed on the Europeans in the year 1762, when the revolt was in the above colony. The&s;e were now admitted as private
<PB N="124" REF="165">
&s;oldiers in our regiment, and were Colonel Fourgeoud's greate&s;t favourites.</P>
<P>Before we left Paramaribo, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing two very extraordinary animals of the aquatic kind; the one was in Mr. Roux's cabinet of curio&s;ities, and is called in the colony <HI>jackee,</HI> in Latin, <HI>rana pi&s;catrix.</HI> This fi&s;h is about eight or ten inches long, without &s;cales, exceeding fat and delicate, as I can te&s;tify by ex|perience, and is found in all narrow creeks and mar&s;hy places. But what is extremely remarkable is, that this creature, however incredible it may appear, ab&s;olutely changes to a perfect frog, but not from a frog to a fi&s;h, as Merian, Zeba, and &s;ome random hi&s;torians (among whom I am &s;orry to name We&s;tley) have been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert; and of this truth I was at this time fully &s;atisfied, by &s;eeing the above animal diffected, and &s;u&s;pended in a bottle with &s;pirits; when the two hinder legs of a very &s;mall frog made their appearance, growing in&s;ide from that part of the back to which u&s;ually the inte&s;tines are fixed. I neverthele&s;s humbly pre&s;ume to &s;uppo&s;e, in this ca&s;e, that the jackee is neither more nor le&s;s than a kind of tadpole, which grows to a large &s;ize before it undergoes the u&s;ual transformation.</P>
<P>The other animal I &s;aw at the hou&s;e of my friend Kennedy: this is what Dr. Bancroft calls the torporific, and others the electrical eel, and which Dr. Firmyn &s;uppo&s;es to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame qualities with the torpedo.
<PB N="125" REF="166">
This wonderful animal is of a lead-blue colour, formed in a great mea&s;ure like an eel, with one large fin that runs below from head to tail, not unlike the keel of a &s;hip. It lives only in fre&s;h water: its length is called by &s;ome three feet, and by others is a&s;&s;erted to be not le&s;s than four or five times as much <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Greenwood, of Leice&s;ter Fields, has told me him&s;elf that he killed one of eleven feet long.</NOTE>. When this animal is touched by the hand, or any rod of metal or hard wood, it communicates a &s;hock, the impul&s;e of which produces the &s;ame effect as electricity; and Dr. Firmyn has even a&s;&s;ured me, that the &s;hock of this electrical eel has been communicated to him through the bodies of eight or ten people, who &s;tood hand in hand for the purpo&s;e of trying the experiment.</P>
<P>For my own part, all that I can &s;ay concerning this animal is, that I &s;aw it in a tub full of water, where it appeared to be about two feet long; that I threw off my coat, and having turned up my &s;hirt-&s;leeves, tried about twenty different times to gra&s;p it with my hand, but all without effect, receiving ju&s;t as many electrical &s;hocks, which I felt even to the top of my &s;houlder, to the great entertainment of Mr. Kennedy, to whom I lo&s;t a &s;mall wager on the occa&s;ion. The electrical eel &s;wims forward or backward at plea&s;ure, it may be eaten with the greate&s;t &s;afety, and is even by many people thought delicious.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that this animal mu&s;t be touched with both hands before it gives the &s;hock, but this I mu&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="167">
take the liberty of contradicting, having experienced the contrary effect: it is al&s;o alledged, that they have been found in Surinam above twenty feet long, but one of that length never yet came within the &s;cope of my ob|&s;ervation; nor have I ever heard of any per&s;on being killed by them, according to the account which is given by the &s;ame author, Alexander Gardon, M. D. F. R. S. in a letter to John Ellis, E&s;q. dated Charle&s;town, South Carolina, Augu&s;t 14th, 1774.</P>
<P>It is a painful circum&s;tance, that the narrative of my travels mu&s;t &s;o frequently prove the record of cruelty and barbarity: but once for all I mu&s;t declare, that I &s;tate the&s;e facts merely in the hope that it may, in &s;ome mode or other, operate for their future prevention. Before my departure, I was informed of a mo&s;t &s;hocking in&s;tance of depravity, which had ju&s;t occurred. A Jewe&s;s, im|pelled by a groundle&s;s jealou&s;y, (for &s;uch her hu&s;band made it appear) put an end to the life of a young and beautiful Quadroon girl, by the infernal means of plunging into her body a red-hot poker. But what is mo&s;t incredible, and what indeed will &s;carcely be be|lieved in a civilized country, is, that for this mo&s;t dia|bolical crime the murdere&s;s was only bani&s;hed to the Jew-Savannah, a village which I &s;hall afterwards de|&s;cribe, and condemned in a trifling fine to the fi&s;cal or town-clerk of the colony.</P>
<P>Another young negro woman, having her ancles chain|ed &s;o clo&s;e together that &s;he could &s;carcely move her

feet, was knocked down with a cane by a Jew, and beaten till the blood &s;treamed out of her head, her arms, and her naked &s;ides. So accu&s;tomed, indeed, are the people of this country to tyranny and in&s;olence, that a third I&s;raelite had the impudence to &s;trike one of my &s;oldiers, for having made water again&s;t his garden-fence. On this mi&s;creant I took revenge for the whole fraternity, by wre&s;ting the offending weapon out of his hand, which I in&s;tantly broke into a thou&s;and pieces on his guilty naked pate.</P>
<P>I neverthele&s;s was ju&s;t enough to flog another man out of the regiment, for picking a Jew's pocket: and, to their credit be it mentioned, that &s;o jealous are the Dutch &s;oldiers of what they call a point of honour, that were a thief to be known, and kept in the ranks, the whole regiment would lay down their arms. This etiquette is of great utility, and would be no bad practice to be introduced into &s;ome other armies, where a thief is too often accounted as good as another, if he is &s;o for|tunate as to be &s;ix feet high.</P>
<P>About this time Colonel Fourgeoud i&s;&s;ued the following orders, <HI>viz.</HI> that in ca&s;e it ever happened that two officers, or under-officers, of equal rank, the one of the European the other of the Society corps, &s;hould meet on any mili|tary duty, the fir&s;t &s;hould always take the command, in|dependent of &s;eniority, unle&s;s the latter bore a higher commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="169">We now &s;eriou&s;ly prepared for victory or death, on board the wooden walls of the Colony, which con&s;i&s;ted of half a dozen crazy old &s;ugar barges, &s;uch as are u&s;ed by the colliers in the Thames, being only roofed over with boards, which gave them the appearance of &s;o many coffins; and how well they de&s;erved this name, I am afraid will too &s;oon appear by the number of men they buried.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of July were di&s;patched for the river Come|wina, one captain, two &s;ubalterns, one &s;erjeant, two corpo|rals, and eighteen men. Of this captain, I cannot help mentioning a very &s;ingular circum&s;tance&mdash;the fir&s;t day we landed in this colony, having entered the lodging on which he was billetted, his landlady declared &s;he &s;hould ever pride her&s;elf in &s;hewing all the civility in her power to either marines or naval officers, as &s;he owed her life to one of them, who had &s;ome years before picked her up in an open boat with &s;everal others, after they had been to&s;&s;ed about &s;ixteen days without either compa&s;s, &s;ail, or provi&s;ions, a little &s;ea-bi&s;cuit and water excepted, on the Atlantic ocean. To avoid circumlocution, this very gen|tleman, who&s;e name was Tulling Van Older Barnevelt, proved to be the individual officer who had &s;aved her from the jaws of death, as he at that time belonged to the navy, being a lieutenant of a Dutch man of war.</P>
<P>This &s;ame day we al&s;o di&s;patched another barge with two &s;ubalterns, one &s;erjeant, one corporal, and fourteen
<PB N="129" REF="170">
men, commanded by Lieutenant Count Randwyck, to the river Pirica; and in the evening, having entertained &s;ome &s;elect friends in my hou&s;e, I bade farewell to my Joanna, to who&s;e care I left my all; and her&s;elf to the protection of her mother and aunt, with my directions for putting her to &s;chool until my return: after which, I at la&s;t marched on board, with four &s;ubalterns, two &s;er|jeants, three corporals, and thirty-two men under my command, to be divided into two barges, and bound for the upper part of the river Cottica.&mdash;</P>

<P>The above barges were all armed with &s;wivels, blun|derbu&s;&s;es, &amp;c. and provided with allowance for one month: their orders were (that which went to the Jews Savannah excepted) to cruize up and down the upper parts of the rivers, each barge having a pilot, and rowed by negro &s;laves, ten of which were on board of each for the purpo&s;e, and which made my complement, including my black boy Quaco, exactly &s;ixty-five, thirty-five of which embarked with my&s;elf. With this &s;hip's company was I now &s;towed in my hen-coop; while on board of my lieutenant's barge the crew con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-nine only, and con&s;equently were le&s;s cowded</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="171">I mu&s;t take notice that from our fir&s;t landing in Surinam till this time our private men were paid in <HI>&s;ilver</HI> coin, which the captains had propo&s;ed to exchange for card money, at the rate of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> gain for them; by which the poor fellows would have benefited between two and three hundred pounds &s;terling <HI>per annum,</HI> to buy refre&s;hment: but Colonel Fourgeoud in&s;i&s;ted they &s;hould continue to receive their little pittance in coin, which in &s;mall &s;ums was of no more value than paper; and I thought unaccountably hard, &s;ince this was hurting the whole, without profit to one &s;ingle individual. One thing more I mu&s;t remark, which is, that all the officers who were now proceeding upon duty continued to pay at the me&s;s, which co&s;t each captain at the rate of forty pounds; but for which, in his barge, he was to re|ceive in provi&s;ions after the rate of ten pounds (thus he lo&s;t thirty pounds; and the&s;e provi&s;ions were &s;alt beef, pork, and pea&s;e) on an equal footing with the private &s;oldiers, a few bottles of wine excepted. But certainly &s;ome greater indulgence was due, and I mu&s;t &s;ay nece&s;&s;ary, to officers, who were going to be &s;tationed where ab&s;olutely no kind of refre&s;hment was to be had, being &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t horrid and impe|netrable woods, beyond the hearing of a cannon-&s;hot from any port or plantation whatever. This was not the ca&s;e with the other barges, who were &s;tationed in the mid&s;t of peace and plenty, being within view of the mo&s;t beautiful e&s;tates. We were indeed pitied

by all ranks without exception; who fore&s;eeing our approaching calamities, crouded my barge with the be&s;t commodities they had to pre&s;ent, which they in&s;i&s;ted upon my accepting.

Its foundations are a kind of rocky ground; and its principal &s;trength by water a large bank of mud off the point, &s;upported by a &s;trong battery of cannon, which prevents even flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els from making any approach in that quarter; and by cro&s;&s;ing the fire of the guns with the oppo&s;ite re|doubts, Leyden and Purmerent, it protects the entry of both the rivers, Surinam and Comewina, as I have &s;aid before: it has, be&s;ides, powder-magazines and victualling-offices, and is well provided with all the other nece&s;&s;ary buildings for the u&s;e of a &s;trong garri&s;on. There are even a corn-windmill, and a ci&s;tern which will hold
<PB N="134" REF="176">
above a thou&s;and hog&s;heads of water. This in fact is no more than nece&s;&s;ary; &s;ince, according to my opinion, it will take the whole army of Surinam to defend &s;o large an extent for any length of time. Adjoining to the for|tre&s;s is al&s;o a large &s;pot of ground, well &s;tocked with plantains, yams, &amp;c. in order to feed the Society &s;laves, which are kept here, at the colony's expence, to work at the fortifications, under the in&s;pection of a proper over&s;eer.</P>
<P>In this fort is generally &s;tationed a &s;mall garri&s;on, com|manded by an officer of the artillery, which obliges all ve&s;&s;els whatever to bring-to, &s;hew their colours, and &s;alute them with &s;even guns each, the compliment being an|&s;wered with three guns from the battery, and the hoi&s;t|ing of a flag on the ramparts. I &s;hall only add, that this fortre&s;s is, on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide, &s;urrounded with bogs and impenetrable bu&s;hes, and that the &s;pot was, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, formerly called the Tyger's Hole.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed fort New Am&s;terdam, I cannot leave it without taking notice of &s;ome very remarkable fi&s;h, which are always &s;een in great quantities near this town, and which have actually four eyes, &s;wimming con&s;tantly with two above and two under the water. The&s;e fi&s;hes are about the &s;ize of a &s;melt, and &s;wim in &s;hoals with incredible velocity; they &s;eem principally to delight in blacki&s;h water, are accounted no bad eating, and are called <HI>coot-eye</HI> by the inhabitants of the colony.</P>

<P>On the fourth of July, in the morning, we weighed anchor; and having doubled the Cape, rowed with the flood till we arrived before Elizabeth's Hope, a beautiful coffee plantation, where the proprietor, Mr. Klynhams, inviting us on &s;hore, &s;hewed us every civility in his power, and loaded my barge with refre&s;hing fruits, ve|getables, &amp;c. He told us that he pitied our &s;ituation from his heart, and foretold the mi&s;eries we were going to encounter, the rainy &s;ea&s;on being ju&s;t at hand, or in|deed having already commenced, by frequent &s;howers, accompanied with loud claps of thunder.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for the enemy,"
&s;aid he,
"you may depend on not &s;eeing one &s;ingle &s;oul of them; they know better than to make their appearance openly, while they may have a chance of &s;eeing you from under cover: thus, Sir, take care to be upon your guard&mdash;but the climate, the climate will murder you all. However,"
continued he,
"this &s;hews the zeal of your commander, who will rather &s;ee you killed, than &s;ee you eat the bread of idlene&s;s at Paramaribo."</Q>
&mdash;This plea&s;ant harangue he accompa|nied with a &s;queeze by the hand. We then took our

leave, while the beautiful Mrs. Dutry, his daughter, &s;hed tears at our departure.&mdash;This evening we anchored be|fore the Matapaca Creek.</P>
<P>I here created my two barges men of war, and named them the <HI>Charon</HI> and the <HI>Cerberus,</HI> by which names I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h them during the re&s;t of the voyage; though the <HI>Sudden Death</HI> and <HI>Wilful Murder</HI> were much more applicable, as will be &s;een. We now continued rowing up the river Cottica, having pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince we entered Rio Comewina, &s;ome mo&s;t enchantingly beautiful e&s;tates of coffee and &s;ugar, which line the banks of both the&s;e ri|vers, at the di&s;tance of one or two miles from each other.</P>
<P>My crew having walked and dre&s;t their dinner a&s;hore on the plantation l'Avanture, we anchored, on the even|ing of the 5th, before Rio Pirica.</P>
<P>On the following day we rowed &s;till further up the river Cottica, and went on &s;hore on the e&s;tate Alia. At all the above plantations we were mo&s;t ho&s;pitably re|ceived, but we met with fewer plantations as the river grew narrower.</P>
<P>On the 7th we continued our cour&s;e, and having walked a&s;hore on the e&s;tate Bockke&s;tyne, being the la&s;t plantation up the river Cottica on the right, except one or two &s;mall e&s;tates in Patamaca, at night we ca&s;t anchor at the mouth of Coopman's Creek. This day the Charon was on fire, but happily it was &s;oon extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 8th, we again kept rowing upwards, and at eleven o'clock A. M. ca&s;t anchor off the fort Slans Wel|veren,
<PB N="137" REF="180">
which was guarded by the troops of the Society. Here I &s;tepped on &s;hore, with my officers, to wait on Captain Orzinga, the commander, and delivered three of my &s;ick men into his ho&s;pital; where I beheld &s;uch a &s;pectacle of mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s as baffles all imagi|nation: this place having been formerly called <HI>Devil's Harwar,</HI> on account of its intolerable unhealthine&s;s&mdash;a name by which alone I &s;hall again di&s;tingui&s;h it, as much more &s;uitable than that of Slans Welveren, which &s;ignifies the welfare of the nation.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw a few of the wounded wretches, who had e&s;caped from the engagement in which Lieutenant Lep|per, with &s;o many men, had been killed; and one of them told me the particulars of his own miraculous e&s;cape:&mdash; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was &s;hot, Sir," &s;aid he,
"with a mu&s;quet-bullet in my brea&s;t; and to re&s;i&s;t or e&s;cape being impo&s;&s;ible, as the only means left me to &s;ave my life I threw my&s;elf down among the mortally wounded, and the dead, without moving hand or foot. Here in the evening the rebel chief, &s;urveying his conque&s;t, ordered one of his captains to begin in&s;tantly to cut off the heads of the &s;lain, in order to carry them home to their village, as trophies of their victory: this captain, having al|ready chopped off that of Lieutenant Lepper, and one or two more, &s;aid to his friend, <HI>Sonde go &s;leeby, caba mekewe liby den tara dogo tay tamara</HI>; The &s;un is ju&s;t going to &s;leep, we mu&s;t leave tho&s;e other dogs till to|morrow.

They went away, carrying along with them the mangled heads of my comrades, and five or &s;ix pri&s;oners alive, with their hands tied behind their backs, of whom I never &s;ince have heard. When all was quiet, and it was very dark, I found means, on my hands and feet, to creep out from among the carnage, and get under cover in the fore&s;t, where I met another of our &s;oldiers, who was le&s;s wounded than my&s;elf; with whom, after ten days wandering, in torment and de&s;pair, without bandages, not knowing which way to proceed, and only one &s;ingle loaf of black bread for our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, we at la&s;t arrived at the military po&s;t of Patamaca, emaciated, and our putrefied wounds full of live worms."</Q></P>
<P>I gave the mi&s;erable creature half-a-crown; and hav|ing agreed with Captain Orzinga upon the &s;ignals, we left this pe&s;t-hou&s;e, and &s;tepping on board my man of war, rowed up till we arrived before a creek, called Bar|bacoba, where we once more came to an anchor.</P>
<P>On the following day we continued to row farther up the river, till we came before the Cormoetibo Creek, where we moored the fleet, as being my head
<PB N="139" REF="182">
&s;tation, by Colonel Fourgeoud's command. Here we &s;aw nothing but water, wood, and clouds; no trace of hu|manity, and con&s;equently the place had a mo&s;t di&s;mal, &s;olitary appearance.</P>
<P>On the 10th I detached the Cerberus to her &s;tation, <HI>viz.</HI> Upper Patamaca; for which place &s;he rowed imme|diately, with a long li&s;t of paroles, according to my or|ders, but which were never of any &s;ervice.</P>
<P>We now tried to cook the victuals on board; our fur|nace was a large tub filled with earth, and we &s;ucceeded, at the expence of having almo&s;t &s;calded one of my men to death, and at the hazard of &s;etting the barge once more on fire. As we had no &s;urgeon along with us, this office fell to my lot; and, by the help of a &s;mall che&s;t of medicines, I performed &s;o well, that in a few days the &s;calded marine recovered.</P>
<P>To prevent, however, a &s;imilar accident again, I &s;ought an opening in the creek above-named, which having found not very far from the mouth, I ordered my negroes to build a &s;hed, and my men to dre&s;s their victuals below it, placing &s;entinels around them to prevent a &s;urprize, and in the evening we returned to our &s;tation. This cooking we continued to perform every day, until the fourteenth, when we rowed down to Barbacoba.</P>
<P>Here we built another &s;hed on the 15th, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and then, the rain already beating through my decks, we rowed down to Devil's Harwar for repair, where I put one of my negroes &s;ick in the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="183">On the 16th, I got my deck caulked and payed, and &s;ent an account of our arrival to Colonel Fourgeoud.</P>
<P>On the 17th, we returned to Cormoetibo Creek, having lo&s;t an anchor among the roots of the mangrove-trees that on both &s;ides line the banks of all the rivers in the colony. The&s;e trees are of two &s;pecies, the red and the white, but the former is that of which I now &s;peak: it ri&s;es from a number of roots that &s;hew them&s;elves above ground for &s;everal feet before they are joined to|gether, and form the trunk, which is both large and tall; the bark is grey on the out&s;ide, but the in&s;ide is red, and u&s;ed for tanning leather. The wood is reddi&s;h, hard, and good for building and other purpo&s;es; but the mo&s;t remarkable property of this tree is, that from its extended branches, and even its trunk, de&s;cend thou&s;ands of ligneous &s;hoots, like the ropes of a &s;hip, which drop|ping to the earth, take root and again re-a&s;cend, form|ing for a great circumference an impenetrable thicket, while, like &s;o many props, they keep the tree &s;teady in all weathers. The white mangrove is found mo&s;tly in places more di&s;tant from the water.</P>
<P>This evening my &s;entinel, when it was very dark, called out that he &s;aw a negro, with a lighted tobacco-pipe, cro&s;s the Cormoetibo Creek in a canoe. We lo&s;t no time in leaping out of our hammocks; but were not a little mortified, when one of my &s;laves declared it was no more than a fire-fly on the wing&mdash;which actually was the ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="184">The&s;e in&s;ects are above an inch long, with a round patch under the belly, of a tran&s;parent greeni&s;h colour, which in the dark gives a light like a candle: its eyes are al&s;o very luminous, and by the light of a couple of the&s;e flies one may &s;ee very well to read &s;mall print. There is another &s;pecies, which is &s;maller, and only to be ob&s;erved when they fly elevated, at which time they appear like the intermitting &s;parks of fire emitted from the forge of a black&s;mith.</P>
<P>On the 18th, having nothing el&s;e to do, I &s;hot a bird, which is here called a <HI>tigri-fowlo,</HI> or tiger-bird, but which I take to be of the heron &s;pecies; it is about the &s;ize of a heron, but of a reddi&s;h colour, covered over with regular black &s;pots, from which it has derived its name: its bill, which is long and &s;trait, as al&s;o the legs and toes, are of a pale green colour, and &s;eem to indicate that it lives upon fi&s;h: the neck is al&s;o long, from which hangs down a kind of heavy feathers. On the head, which is &s;mall, it has a roundi&s;h black &s;pot, and its eyes are a beautiful yellow.</P>
<P>By a water-patrole from the Cerberus I received intel|ligence this evening, that the men began to be &s;ickly; and on the following day I was informed, that on the &s;pot where we had dre&s;&s;ed our victuals, in the Cormoetibo Creek, and which is on the rebel &s;ide of the river, a &s;trong detachment had lately been murdered by the enemy. I therefore ordered the &s;hed to be burnt to the ground, and the meat to be dre&s;&s;ed on board the barges.
<PB N="142" REF="185">
Here all the elements now &s;eemed to unite in oppo&s;ing us; the water pouring down like a deluge, the heavy rains forced them&s;elves fore and aft into the ve&s;&s;el, where they &s;et every thing afloat; the air was infe&s;ted with myriads of mu&s;quitoes, which, from &s;un-&s;et to &s;un|ri&s;ing, con&s;tantly kept us company, and prevented us from getting any &s;leep, and left us in the morning be|&s;meared all over with blood, and full of blotches. The &s;moak of the fire and tobacco, which we burnt to annoy them, was enough to choak us; and not a foot-&s;tep of land could we find, where we might cook our &s;alt pro|vi&s;ions in &s;afety. To all this mi&s;ery may be added, that di&s;cord broke out between the marines and the negroes, with whom, as promi&s;es or threats had as yet no weight, I was obliged to have recour&s;e to other means. I tied up the ringleaders of both parties; and after ordering the fir&s;t to be well flogged, and the latter to be hor&s;e|whipped for half an hour, after due &s;u&s;pence and expec|tation, I pardoned them all without one la&s;h. This had equally the effect of the puni&s;hment, and peace was perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; but to prevent approaching di&s;|ea&s;e was totally out of my power. Not all the golden rules in Doctor Arm&s;trong's beautiful poem upon health could avail in this &s;ituation.</P>
<P>We rowed down on the 20th, till we arrived before the Ca&s;epoere Creek, in hopes of meeting &s;ome relief, but were equally uncomfortable. So very thick were the mu&s;quitoes now, that by clapping my two hands to|gether,

I have actually killed to the number of thirty-eight at one &s;troke.</P>
<P>In rowing down to Barbacoeba, we &s;aw one or two beautiful &s;nakes &s;wim acro&s;s the river. In the cour&s;e of our progre&s;s we occa&s;ionally met with a little relief, by &s;tepping a&s;hore under the &s;hade. I now had recour&s;e to the advice of an old negro. &mdash; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Caramaca," &s;aid I, "what methods do you take to pre&s;erve your health?"</Q> &mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Swim every day twice or thrice, Sir," &s;aid he,
"in the river. This, Ma&s;ara, not only &s;erves for exerci&s;e where I cannot walk, but keeps my &s;kin clean and cool; and the pores being open, I enjoy a free per&s;piration. Without this, by imperceptible filth, the pores are &s;hut, the juices &s;tagnate, and di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t inevitably follow."</Q>
Having recompen&s;ed the old gentleman with a dram, I in&s;tantly &s;tripped and plunged headlong into the river. I had, however, no &s;ooner taken this leap, than he called to me for God's &s;ake to come on board; which having done with much a&s;toni&s;hment, he reminded me of the alligators, as well as of a fi&s;h which is here called <HI>pery.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Both the&s;e, Sir," &s;aid he,
"are exceed|ingly dangerous, but by following my directions you will run no hazard. You may &s;wim entirely naked, only take care that you con&s;tantly keep in motion; for the moment you are quiet, you run the ri&s;k of their &s;napping off a limb, or being dragged to the bottom."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="187">Having mentioned the alligator, I &s;hall take the li|berty to offer to the reader (though he cannot but have met with &s;ome account of this creature in reading different voyages) &s;ome particulars which I have my&s;elf ob&s;erved, or of which I have been informed on the be&s;t authority.</P>
<P>It is an amphibious animal, and found in mo&s;t rivers in Guiana; its &s;ize is from four to eighteen or twenty feet in length; the tail as long as the body, both of which are on the upper part indented like a &s;aw, its &s;hape being &s;omething like a lizard; the colour on the back is a yel|lowi&s;h brown, approaching to black, variegated on the &s;ides with greeni&s;h &s;hades, the belly being a dirty white; the head is large, with a &s;nout and eyes &s;omewhat re&s;embling tho&s;e of a &s;ow; the la&s;t immoveable, and guarded each by a large protuberance or hard knob. The mouth and throat, extremely wide, are be&s;et with double rows of teeth, that can &s;nap almo&s;t through any bone: it has four feet, armed with claws and hard &s;harp-pointed nails. The whole animal is covered over with large &s;cales, and a &s;kin &s;o thick that it is invulnerable, even by a mu&s;quet|ball, except in the head or the belly, where it is mo&s;t liable to be wounded; its fle&s;h is eaten by the natives, but is of a mu&s;ky ta&s;te and flavour, owing it is &s;aid to a kind of bags or bladders which are on the in&s;ide of each limb. The alligator lays its eggs on the &s;hore to a great num|ber in the &s;and, where they are hatched by the &s;un, the

males eating the greater portion of them. On land this animal is not dangerous for want of activity, but in the rivers, where he is often &s;een lurking for his prey, with his muzzle alone above water, &s;omething like the &s;tump of an old tree, he is truly tremendous to all that approach him; yet of man, as I have &s;een, he is afraid, during the time he keeps his hands and feet in motion, but no longer. Some negroes even have the courage to attack and vanqui&s;h the alligator in his own element, notwith|&s;tanding his violent &s;trength and unequalled ferocity, being particularly fond of human fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The difference between the above animal and the cro|codile (which is al&s;o found in Surinam) con&s;i&s;ts not merely in the name, but in the &s;hape and in the nature al&s;o, the latter being longer and more &s;lender in pro|portion, and not &s;o ferocious; the alligator or cayman (as called by the natives and negroes) is be&s;ides more frequently met with than the crocodile, which partly may be the cau&s;e of its being &s;uppo&s;ed to be more de&s;tructive. I &s;hall only add, that in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> there is a con&s;iderable difference to be found upon a nice examination between the above two reptiles, where they are al&s;o larger than they are in any parts of America.</P>
<P>Had it not been for an accident, the&s;e creatures would never have been known by any other name than that of crocodile: for had the fir&s;t navigators &s;een any thing more re&s;embling their form than a lizard, they would have adopted that which the Indians called them by, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="190">
the <HI>cayman</HI>; but the Spani&s;h &s;ailors remarking their great re&s;emblance to that little reptile, they called the fir&s;t of them which they &s;aw <HI>lagarto,</HI> or lizard. When our countrymen arrived, and heard that name, they called the creature <HI>a-lagarto,</HI> whence is derived the word <HI>alligato,</HI> or alligator.</P>
<P>The great advantage of &s;uch repo&s;itories of Natural Hi&s;tory as the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum is, that they enable the lover of nature and truth to be &s;atisfied by his own eyes of the extraordinary and almo&s;t incredible productions of nature. In the above-named collection may be &s;een a crocodile, differing in &s;ome particulars, but chiefly in its dimen&s;ions, from the creatures of the &s;ame name in other parts of India. Though &s;o numerous in <HI>Bengal,</HI> I never heard upon good authority of one much larger than this, which mea&s;ures above twenty-one feet. It was taken in the river <HI>Indus,</HI> but not till it had received on many parts of its body &s;everal three-pound balls, many of which could not penetrate, or produce the lea&s;t effect again&s;t his &s;cales.</P>
<P>As I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily produce my voucher, I mu&s;t pledge my veracity for another &s;pecimen, which I have my&s;elf &s;een; which proves to me that there have been &s;ome of this &s;pecies of more than twice the &s;ize of that which may be mea&s;ured in the Mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>At <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> in 1781, I &s;aw the head of a crocodile petrified, which had been dug out of Mount <HI>Saint Pierre:</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="191">
the body of which, by calculation, mu&s;t have mea&s;ured above &s;ixty feet in length.&mdash;Query, when, or how, did this animal come <HI>there?</HI> Yet <HI>there</HI> with a&s;toni&s;hment I beheld it, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a prie&s;t, who &s;ince &s;ent it to Paris as a very great curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>In Guiana there are &s;aid to be lizards of the &s;ize of five or &s;ix feet; but that &s;pecies which is here called the <HI>iguana,</HI> and by the Indians the <HI>wayamaca,</HI> is &s;eldom above three feet long. From the head to the extremity of the tail, it is covered over with &s;mall &s;cales, reflecting very brilliant colours in the &s;un; the back and legs are of a dark blue, the &s;ides and belly of a yellowi&s;h kind of green, as al&s;o the bag or loo&s;e &s;kin which hangs under its throat. It is &s;potted in many parts with brown and black, and its eyes are a beautiful pale red, while the claws are of a deep che&s;nut colour.</P>
<P>This lizard, like the alligator, has its back and tail indented, both which are formed into a &s;harp edge. It lays its eggs in the &s;and, and is often &s;een among the &s;hrubs and plants, where the Indians &s;hoot it with their bows and arrows. The&s;e people e&s;teem its fle&s;h, which is very white, as a great delicacy; it is &s;old dear at Para|maribo, and bought as a dainty by many of the white inhabitants. This creature's bite is extremely painful, but &s;eldom attended with bad con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But to return to my negro Caramaca, I acknow|ledge his account at fir&s;t di&s;couraged me from the
<PB N="148" REF="192">
plan of daily bathing for health; but finding by fol|lowing his direction that the dangers he repre&s;ented were to be avoided, I re&s;olved to follow it, and derived great benefit from the practice as long as I remained in the colony. This negro al&s;o advi&s;ed me to walk bare-footed and thinly dre&s;&s;ed.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now is the &s;ea&s;on, Ma&s;&s;era,"
&s;aid he,
"to u&s;e your feet to become hard, by walking on the &s;mooth boards of the ve&s;&s;el; the time may come when you will be obliged to do &s;o for want of &s;hoes, in the mid&s;t of thorns and briers, as I have &s;een &s;ome others. Cu&s;tom," &s;aid he,
"Ma&s;&s;era, is &s;econd nature: our feet were all made alike. Do &s;o as I advi&s;e you; and in the end you will thank old Caramaca. As for being thinly dre&s;&s;ed,"
continued the negro,
"a &s;hirt and trow&s;ers is fully &s;ufficient; which not only &s;aves trouble and expence, but the body wants air, as well as it does water: &s;o bathe in both when you have the opportunity."</Q>
&mdash; From that moment I followed his coun&s;els, to which, be&s;ides being cleanly and cool, I in a great mea&s;ure a&s;cribe the pre&s;ervation of my life.

<P>Here one of my negroes caught &s;ome fi&s;h, among&s;t which was the torporific eel already de&s;cribed, which he dre&s;&s;ed and eat with his companions; the others were the <HI>pery</HI> and <HI>que-quee:</HI> the <HI>pery</HI> was that mentioned by the old &s;lave as dangerou&s;ly rapacious. This fi&s;h is &s;ome|times near two feet long, of a flatti&s;h make, &s;caly, and of a bluei&s;h colour; the mouth large, and thick &s;et with &s;harp teeth, which are &s;o &s;trong, and the <HI>pery</HI> &s;o vora|cious, that it frequently &s;naps off the feet of ducks when &s;wimming, nay even the toes, the fingers, and the brea&s;ts of women. The <HI>que-quee</HI> may be called a fi&s;h in armour, being covered over from head to tail with brown coloured moveable rings, &s;liding the one over the other, and joined like tho&s;e of a lob&s;ter, which &s;erve for its de|fence in place of &s;cales. This la&s;t is from &s;ix to ten inches long, with a large head and of a roundi&s;h &s;hape. Both the <HI>pery</HI> and the <HI>que-quee</HI> are very good eating.&mdash;But I mu&s;t for &s;ome time lay a&s;ide the de&s;cription, and return to my journal.</P>
<P>The 23d, being the day appointed by Captain Orzinga and my&s;elf for the trial of the &s;ignals, at twelve o'clock preci&s;ely the whole number of blunderbu&s;&s;es and &s;wivels were fired at Devil's Harwar on board the Charon, and on board the Cerberus &s;till &s;tationed at Patamaca; which proved to be to no purpo&s;e, no per&s;on on board either of

the ve&s;&s;els having been able to hear the report of the guns fired by the other. During this, however, I met with a &s;mall accident, by firing my&s;elf one of the blun|derbu&s;&s;es, which I placed like a mu&s;quet again&s;t my &s;houlder; when I received &s;uch a &s;troke by its rebound|ing as threw me backward over a large hog&s;head of beef, and had nearly di&s;located my right arm. This however it &s;eems was owing to my ignorance of the man|ner of u&s;ing the blunderbu&s;s, as I have &s;ince been informed that all &s;uch weapons ought to be fired under the hand, e&s;pecially when heavy charged; and then by &s;winging round the body &s;uddenly, the force of the rebound is broken, and the effect &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible. I in&s;ert this only to &s;hew in what manner heavy-loaded mu&s;catoons ought always to be fired; e&s;pecially &s;ince, without any aim, the execution from their wide mouth is almo&s;t equally fatal.</P>
<P>On the 26th, by a canoe that came down from Pata|maca, I received intelligence that the Cerberus was in danger of being &s;urpri&s;ed by the enemy, who had been di&s;covered hovering round about her; and the part of the river where &s;he was moored being very narrow, I con&s;idered her &s;ituation as critical. I therefore imme|diately rowed the Charon up before the Pinneburgh Creek; and having manned the yawl, as being the mo&s;t expeditious, went my&s;elf, with &s;ix men, to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance: but was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed at finding the whole to be a fal&s;e alarm. In the evening we returned back to
<PB N="151" REF="195">
our &s;tation. In rowing down I was a&s;toni&s;hed at being hailed by a human voice, which begged me for God's &s;ake to &s;tep on &s;hore. This I did, with two of my men; when I was acco&s;ted by a poor old negro woman, im|ploring me to afford her &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It &s;eems &s;he was the property of a Jew, to whom belonged the &s;pot of ground where I found her, and where the poor crea|ture lived quite alone, in a hut not larger than a dog-kennel, &s;urrounded by a wilderne&s;s, with only a few plantain-trees, yams, and ca&s;&s;ava, for her &s;upport. She was no longer of u&s;e to work on the great e&s;tate, and was bani&s;hed here only to &s;upport her ma&s;ter's right to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ince this &s;pot had been ruined by the re|bels. Having left with her a piece of &s;alt beef, &s;ome barley, and a bottle of rum, I took my leave, when &s;he offered me in return one of her cats: but this I could not accept, for by this token, I mean upon the information of the cats, my negro rowers firmly in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he mu&s;t be a witch; which evinces that this &s;uper&s;tition is not confined to Europe.</P>
<P>In this creek, the banks of which on both &s;ides are co|vered with mangrove-trees, thorns, and briers, we found floating on the &s;urface of the water a kind of large white nut, which &s;eemed to have dropped of them&s;elves by ripene&s;s from the &s;hell. They are &s;weet, cri&s;p, and exceedingly good eating; but I neglected to inquire from what tree they had fallen. A kind of water &s;hrub, called the <HI>mocco-mocco,</HI> is here al&s;o to be found in great
<PB N="152" REF="196">
quantities. It grows about &s;ix or eight feet high, thick at bottom, jointed and prickly all the way to the top, where it is very &s;mall, and divided into three or four large &s;mooth oval leaves, which po&s;&s;e&s;s almo&s;t the quality of bli&s;tering by their violent adhe&s;ion to the &s;kin.</P>
<P>As we approached the Charon in the evening, I found my &s;entinel fa&s;t a&s;leep, which enraged me &s;o much, that having quietly entered on board the barge, I fired my pi&s;tol clo&s;e to his ear, ju&s;t over his head, a&s;&s;uring him that I would the next time blow it through his brains: the whole crew flew to their arms, and the poor fellow had nearly leaped into the water. But however it might be nece&s;&s;ary to threaten in this manner, at a po&s;t where a &s;urprize might be fatal, it would have been ex|ce&s;&s;ive cruelty to have executed it in &s;uch a &s;ituation, where the bite of the mu&s;quitoes rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to reckon upon &s;leep at &s;tated times; and thus the inter|ruption of it at one time made the approach of it un|avoidable at another.</P>
<P>We now returned, on the 27th, to Cormoetibo Creek, where my negroes, having been a&s;hore to cut wood for the furnace, brought on board a poor animal alive, with all its four feet chopped off with the bill-hook, and which lay &s;till in the bottom of the canoe. Having freed it from its torment by a blow on the head, I was acquainted that this was the <HI>&s;loth,</HI> called <HI>loyaree</HI> or <HI>heay</HI> by the natives, on account of its plaintive voice. It is about the &s;ize of a &s;mall water-&s;paniel, with a round
<PB REF="197">
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="153" REF="198">
head &s;omething like that of a monkey, but its mouth is remarkably large; its hinder legs are much &s;horter than tho&s;e before, to help it in climbing, being each armed with <HI>three</HI> very large and &s;harp claws, by which it holds its body on the boughs, but which, as being offen&s;ive weapons, my negroes had &s;o cruelly chopped off: its eyes are languid, and its voice is &s;queaking, like that of a young cat. The greate&s;t particularity of this creature however is, that its motion is &s;o very &s;low, that it often takes two days to get up to the top of a moderate tree, from this it never de&s;cends while a leaf or a bud is re|maining; beginning its deva&s;tation fir&s;t at the top, to prevent its being &s;tarved in coming to the bottom, when it goes in que&s;t of another, proceeding incredibly &s;low indeed while on the ground. Some &s;ay, that to avoid the pain of exerci&s;ing its limbs, it forms it&s;elf into a ball, and drops down from the branches: that may be true or not, but this I know to be a fact, that it cannot mend its pace.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e animals there are two &s;pecies in Guiana, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Ai</HI> and the <HI>Unan</HI>; but in Surinam di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of the <HI>Sicapo</HI> and <HI>Dago luyaree,</HI> or the Sheep and the Dog Sloth, on account of their hair; that of the fir&s;t being bu&s;hy, and of a dirty grey, while the other is lank and reddi&s;h-coloured. This la&s;t has al&s;o but <HI>two</HI> claws on each foot, and the head is le&s;s round than the former. Both the&s;e creatures, by forming them&s;elves in a clew, have often more the appearance of excre&s;cences in the bark, than that of animals feeding upon the fo|liage,
<PB N="154" REF="199">
which frequently prevents them from being di&s;co|vered by the natives and negroes, who devour their fle&s;h with avidity.</P>
<P>Now came down from Patamaca, on the 28th, Lieute|nant <HI>Stromer,</HI> the commander of the Cerberus, in a burn|ing fever, and &s;corched by the &s;un in an open canoe, drinking cold water from the river as his only relief. In this &s;ituation, a Jew &s;oldier, of the Society po&s;t La Ro|chelle, accompanied him, with the account that the rebels had actually pa&s;&s;ed the creek two days before, one mile above the <HI>la&s;t</HI> e&s;tate, as had been fir&s;t reported, <HI>viz.</HI> marching from ea&s;t to we&s;t.&mdash;He at the &s;ame time deli|vered to me a negro woman, with a &s;ucking infant, who had formerly been &s;tolen by the rebels, and had now found means to make her e&s;cape. From below I received al&s;o the news, that Major <HI>Medlar</HI> had &s;ent to town from the <HI>Jew Savannah</HI> two dried hands of the enemy, killed by the rangers; that an officer with ten men and &s;ome provi&s;ions were landed at Devil's Harwar, there to be under my command; and that one of my marines at that place was dead. The &s;ame di&s;patches brought an order for me to look out for a dry &s;pot, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to build a temporary &s;torehou&s;e.</P>
<P>I immediately detached my lieutenant, Mr. <HI>Hamer,</HI> to take the command of the Cerberus, and having weighed anchor, rowed down till I arrived before the Ca&s;epory Creek, where we pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a night as no pen can de&s;cribe: &mdash; The &s;ick groaned, the Jew pray|ed aloud, the &s;oldiers &s;wore, the negroes intreated,
<PB N="155" REF="200">
the women &s;ung, the child &s;queaked, the fire &s;moked, the rains poured down, and the whole ve&s;&s;el &s;tunk to &s;uch a degree, that I began to think my&s;elf but little better off than the unfortunate per&s;ons who were confined in the black hole at Calcutta. At &s;ix o'clock the next morning, however, the joyful &s;un broke through the clouds, and I dropped down with the Charon before De|vil's Harwar.</P>
<P>On the 29th, I delivered my &s;ick officer and five &s;ick men, be&s;ides my other pa&s;&s;engers, for whom I had done all that was in my power, but that was very little; and having &s;towed the newly-arrived provi&s;ions in a proper place, I once more returned to my dreadful &s;tation, where I came to an anchor on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>The following day, between the &s;howers, we &s;aw great numbers of monkies, of which I &s;hot one, and having had no fre&s;h meat for a long time, I ordered it to be dre&s;&s;ed, and eat it with a good appetite. We were at this time in a &s;hocking &s;ituation, not only wanting re|fre&s;hment; but the men's cloaths and hammocks were rotting from day to day, not only from their being al|mo&s;t con&s;tantly wet, but being al&s;o compo&s;ed of the very wor&s;t materials &s;ent from Holland.</P>
<P>On the third, I received the account that Lieutenant Stromer was dead at Devil's Harwar.</P>
<P>On the fourth, we dropped down before the place, to bury him directly, in the hope of doing it with decency, but we were di&s;appointed; for having contrived to make
<PB N="156" REF="201">
a coffin of old boards, the corp&s;e dropped through it be|fore it reached the grave, and exhibited a &s;hocking &s;pec|tacle: we neverthele&s;s found means to go through the re&s;t of the interment with &s;ome decorum, having co|vered it over with a hammock by way of a pall; then fired three vollies with all the troops that had &s;trength to carry arms. This being over, I regaled the officers with a gla&s;s of wine, and once more took a fare|well of Devil's Harwar.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth, having fir&s;t written to Colonel Fourgeoud, to acquaint him that the rebels had pa&s;&s;ed above La Rochelle, and that I had found a &s;pot for a magazine at Barbacoeba, I informed him al&s;o of the death of my lieutenant, Mr. Stromer; and recommended my &s;erjeant, who had been an officer of hu&s;&s;ars, for advancement.</P>
<P>To give the reader &s;ome idea of this &s;pot called Devil's Harwar, I will here take the opportunity to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>This place was formerly a plantation, but is now en|tirely occupied by the military, who keep here a po&s;t, to defend the upper parts of the river Cottica. The &s;oil is elevated and dry, which makes it the more remark|able that it &s;hould be &s;o extremely unwhole&s;ome, yet &s;uch it certainly is: and here hundreds of &s;oldiers have been buried. It lies on the right &s;ide of the river as you go upwards, and had formerly a path of communication with the river Pirica, on which were a few military guards; but this is now little frequented, and quite over|grown.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="203">The buildings on Devil's Harwar are all made of the <HI>pina</HI> or manicole-tree; which tree, and the manner of u&s;ing it for hou&s;es, &amp;c. I &s;hall afterwards attempt to de&s;cribe: but now mu&s;t content my&s;elf with only &s;aying, that on this po&s;t the buildings con&s;i&s;t of a dwelling-hou&s;e for the commanding-officer, with four very good rooms; an|other for the &s;ubalterns; a good lodge for the private &s;oldiers; and an ho&s;pital for the &s;ick, which is large and roomy: but this is no more than is nece&s;&s;ary, as it never is without inhabitants. There is al&s;o a powder and vic|tualling magazine, proper kitchens, a bake-hou&s;e, &amp;c. be|&s;ides a well with fre&s;h water. The Society troops feed a flock of &s;heep, pigs, and poultry at this place, for the u&s;e only of the ho&s;pital: here was al&s;o at this time a cow, which had been allotted for the rangers after Boeccow was taken, but the fea&s;t had not been kept at this place. She had now a calf, and afforded milk for the officers to their tea, &amp;c. but for us poor fellows in the barges there was nothing at all of the kind. I may add, that &s;ome of the officers had al&s;o little gardens here, which afforded them &s;allad, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance which renders Devil's Harwar &s;o un|healthy, in my opinion, is the myriads of mu&s;quitoes that prevent the people from re&s;t, and the multitudes of <HI>chigoes</HI> or &s;and-fleas which abound in that &s;tation.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh, I arrived again at Cormoetibo Creek, where I re&s;olved to make a landing on the &s;outh &s;hore at all hazards, for my own &s;oldiers to cook their beef
<PB N="158" REF="204">
and barley; concluding it as well to be &s;hot by the enemy at once, as to be gradually con&s;umed to death on board the Charon. It was, however, a difficult ta&s;k to find the &s;malle&s;t &s;pot for the purpo&s;e, the whole of that &s;hore being &s;o very mar&s;hy, and over-grown with every kind of underwood, that we could &s;carcely put our new project in execution; till at la&s;t, my negroes having made a temporary kind of bridge, to &s;tep from the yawl upon a &s;mall &s;peck of dry ground, and having formed a &s;light &s;hed of manicole-leaves to keep off the rain, we found means to keep in a fire, and were infinitely more comfortable than we were on board the Charon. Our danger in this &s;ituation, however, was certainly greater than in our former &s;tation; &s;ince an old rebel &s;ettlement was not very far from this place, which was called Pinneburgh, from a neighbouring creek; though others alledge that it obtained this name from the &s;harp pins &s;tuck in the ground, like crow-feet, or <HI>cheveux de frize,</HI> with which the rebels had formerly fortified and defended it. Notwith&s;tanding this village had been de|moli&s;hed, it was well known that the rebels &s;till fre|quently vi&s;ited the &s;pot, to pick up &s;ome of the yams and ca&s;adas (which the ground continued, in its uncultivated &s;tate, to produce) for a temporary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I was in|deed almo&s;t ab&s;olutely convinced that the rebels, who had lately pa&s;&s;ed above La Rochelle in Patamaca, were at this moment encamped at the above &s;pot Pinneburgh, and ready to commit &s;ome depredations on the e&s;tates on
<PB N="159" REF="205">
the river Cottica or Pirica, if not to attack our&s;elves; on this account I always kept double &s;entinels round the landing-place, and gave orders that no men &s;hould be allowed to &s;peak or make any kind of noi&s;e while on that &s;pot, in order that we might hear the &s;malle&s;t ru&s;tling of a leaf, and &s;o obviate our danger by vigilance and alacrity.</P>
<P>On the 8th my other officer Macdonald fell &s;ick, but refu&s;ed to be &s;ent to Devil's Harwar, as he would not &s;uffer me to be left quite by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that we had no &s;urgeon, but carried with us a parcel of medicines, which con&s;i&s;ted of emetics, cathartics, and powders, of which I knew not the proper u&s;e. At their de&s;ire, however, I daily di&s;tributed them to the men, who, loading their &s;tomachs with heavy &s;alt provi&s;ions, and u&s;ing no exerci&s;e, had &s;ometimes oc|ca&s;ion for art to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature. But the&s;e briny meals of pork and beef, Colonel Fourgeoud in&s;i&s;ted were much more whole&s;ome food in a tropical country than fre&s;h provi&s;ions; for, by a mo&s;t curious theory, he a&s;&s;erted that the latter corrupted in the &s;tomach by the heat, whereas the others underwent a proper dige&s;tion. Un|fortunately for us, there were but few on board either the Cerberus or the Charon, who&s;e &s;tomachs were in a &s;tate to dige&s;t &s;uch food. I had al&s;o &s;ome plai&s;ters on board the barge, but the&s;e were &s;oon expended by the run|ning ulcers, with which the whole crew was covered; and this was ea&s;ily accounted for, &s;ince in this climate,
<PB N="160" REF="206">
where the air is impregnated with myriads of invi&s;ible animalcula, the &s;malle&s;t &s;cratch immediately becomes a running &s;ore. The be&s;t antidote and cure for &s;uch com|plaints in this country is lemon or lime acid, but this we had not. The next be&s;t mode of treatment is never to expo&s;e an open wound, or even the &s;malle&s;t &s;cratch, to the air; but the in&s;tant they are received, to cover them with grey paper wetted with &s;pirits, or any kind of moi&s;ture, &s;o that it may &s;tick to the &s;kin. For my own part, no man could enjoy a better &s;tate of health than I continued to enjoy, wearing nothing but my long trow&s;ers, and checked &s;hirt loo&s;e at the collar and turned up in the &s;leeves. Nay, even when the &s;un was not too hot, I &s;tripped all together, and twice every day continued to plunge into the water: by the&s;e means I was always cool and clean; I al&s;o daily u&s;ed a cheering gla&s;s of wine, having fir&s;t hung it a few fathoms under water, which rendered it much more cool and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>During all the&s;e hard&s;hips, I mu&s;t not forget the high gratification which was afforded us one day by a few marcu&s;as that we found in this place, which had been left there &s;tanding ever &s;ince the e&s;tate, many years ago, had been de&s;troyed. There was indeed but one &s;ingle old tree, I &s;hould rather &s;ay a &s;hrub, for the plant which bears them falls more properly under that de&s;cription. This delicious fruit is of an oval form, and of an orange or golden colour; the blo&s;&s;om re&s;embling the pa&s;&s;ion-flower. They are commonly larger, but &s;ome le&s;s than
<PB N="161" REF="207">
a hen's egg, and are broken open as one would break an egg; they are then found to inclo&s;e an a&s;h-coloured &s;ucculent jelly, full of &s;mall &s;eeds. This is &s;ipped out of the &s;hell, being &s;weet mixed with acid, of an ex|qui&s;ite flavour, and &s;o cool that it reminds one of ice marmalade.</P>
<P>Here we remarked a variety of beautiful butterflies, particularly &s;ome of an azure blue, which are exceeding|ly large, and between the &s;howers &s;kimmed and hovered among&s;t the green boughs, to which their ultramarine hue, brightened by the &s;un, bore the mo&s;t enchanting contra&s;t: but as I could not catch one of them while I &s;taid here, I mu&s;t defer the farther de&s;cription to another part of the work.</P>
<P>This evening we heard the &s;ound of a drum, which we could &s;uppo&s;e to be no other than that of the rebels; neverthele&s;s we determined to continue dre&s;&s;ing our vic|tuals a&s;hore, &s;till keeping on our guard, according to the advice of Mr. Klynhams.</P>
<P>On the 9th Mr. Macdonald was much wor&s;e; however, on &s;eeing me receive a letter from Colonel Fourgeoud, he &s;eemed to revive, as we all did, expecting now to be relieved from our horrid &s;ituation. But what was our mortification, at reading that we were &s;till to continue on this forlorn &s;tation! This letter was accompanied by a pre&s;ent of fi&s;h-hooks and tackle, to make up for the deficiency of other refre&s;hments; and, indeed, of &s;alt
<PB N="162" REF="208">
provi&s;ions, which began daily to get both wor&s;e and le&s;s&mdash;
<Q>Timeo Danaeos et dona ferentes.</Q></P>
<P>The receipt of &s;uch unwelcome intelligence made the whole crew declare they were &s;acrificed for no manner of purpo&s;e; while the negroes &s;ighed, pro|nouncing the words, <HI>Ah! poty backera!</HI> Oh! poor Euro|peans! By the di&s;tribution however of a few tamarinds, oranges, lemons, and Madeira wine, which were by this opportunity &s;ent me by my be&s;t friend at Paramaribo, I found means to impart, not only to my officers, but al&s;o to my drooping &s;oldiers, &s;ome relief. But this cheering &s;un-&s;hine could not la&s;t long: and the day following we were as much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as ever, when I had once more recour&s;e to the nimble inhabitants of the fore&s;t, and brought down two monkies with my gun from the top of the mangroves, where they were &s;porting in flocks con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome hundreds.</P>
<P>On the 11th, I &s;ent two men &s;ick to the ho&s;pital, and the &s;ame evening we again heard the drums. On the following day, at noon, we were di&s;turbed by a hurri|cane; the Charon broke loo&s;e from her anchors, and was driven a&s;hore, her upper works being terribly damaged by the &s;tumps of trees, &amp;c. that hung over the river, while the water from the clouds broke in upon us like a torrent, and I expected no le&s;s than a &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="209">On the 15th the other officer, Lieutenant Baron Owen, came down &s;ick from the Cerberus, and at his reque&s;t I ventured to &s;end him down to Paramaribo. I now received another letter from Colonel Fourgeoud, with a little money for the men to purcha&s;e refre&s;hments, where nothing was to be met with: but not a word in|timating that we were to be relieved.</P>
<P>On the 20th I received a report, that the Cerberus, having only four private men left, had retired to the po&s;t at La Rochelle; and, on the 21&s;t, I &s;ent two of my men to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and ordered her back to her former &s;tation.</P>
<P>I now was my&s;elf at la&s;t attacked with a fever, and upon the whole felt my&s;elf in a truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condi|tion; deprived by &s;ickne&s;s of my two only officers, and my &s;erjeant. My men upon the three &s;tations (<HI>viz.</HI> the two barges and Devil's Harwar together) melted down to fifteen, from the number of forty-two, without a &s;ur|geon, or refre&s;hment, &s;urrounded with a black fore&s;t, and expo&s;ed to the mercy of relentle&s;s enemies; who mu&s;t be formidable indeed, &s;hould they be informed by any means of our defencele&s;s &s;ituation. The remaining few were, with truth, declaring they were doomed to de&s;truction; in&s;omuch, that they could with difficulty be prevented from mutiny, and from proceeding down the river Cottica with the Charon again&s;t my orders.</P>
<P>For my own part, I was not altogether free from un|ea&s;ine&s;s. In fact, a few troops from all quarters ought
<PB N="164" REF="210">
to have marched again&s;t the enemy, when they cro&s;&s;ed the Patamaca Creek; that is, from La Rochelle, Devil's Harwar, and the river Pirica; when, being a&s;&s;ailed at once from three quarters, the rebels might have been, if not entirely routed, at lea&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed for their pre&s;umption: not to &s;peak of the happy effect which &s;uch a check mu&s;t have had in &s;aving the lives and pro|perty of tho&s;e victims, who, after &s;uch incur&s;ions, are generally devoted to their rage.</P>
<P>On the 23d I felt my&s;elf rather better; and between the fits of the fever &s;hot a couple of large black monkies to make &s;ome broth, to &s;upply the want of fre&s;h provi|&s;ions: but as the de&s;truction of one of the&s;e animals was attended with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as for ever after had almo&s;t deterred me from going a monkey-hunting, I mu&s;t beg leave to relate them as they happened:&mdash;Seeing me on the &s;ide of the river in the canoe, the creature made a halt from &s;kipping after his companions, and being perched on a branch that hung over the water, examined me with attention, and the &s;tronge&s;t marks of curio&s;ity: no doubt, taking me for a giant of his own &s;pecies; while he chattered prodigiou&s;ly, and kept dancing and &s;haking the bough on which he re&s;ted with incredible &s;trength and agility. At this time I laid my piece to my &s;houlder, and brought him down from the tree into the &s;tream;&mdash;but may I never again be a witne&s;s to &s;uch a &s;cene! The mi&s;erable animal was not dead, but mortally wounded. I &s;eized him by the tail, and taking it in both
<PB N="165" REF="211">
my hands to end his torment, I &s;wung him round, and hit his head again&s;t the &s;ide of the canoe; but the poor creature &s;till continued alive, and looking at me in the mo&s;t affecting manner that can be conceived, I knew no other means to end this murder, than to hold him under water till he was drowned, while my heart felt &s;ick on his account: for his dying little eyes &s;till continued to follow me with &s;eeming reproach, till their light gra|dually for&s;ook them, and the wretched animal expired. I felt &s;o much on this occa&s;ion, that I could neither ta&s;te of him nor his companion, when they were dre&s;&s;ed, though I &s;aw that they afforded to &s;ome others a deli|cious repa&s;t.</P>
<P>That monkies, e&s;pecially when young, are no bad food, may ea&s;ily be accounted for, &s;ince they feed on nothing but fruits, nuts, eggs, young birds, &amp;c.; and indeed, in my opinion, all young quadrupeds are eatable: but when one compares tho&s;e which are killed in the woods to tho&s;e filthy and di&s;gu&s;ting creatures that di&s;grace the &s;treets, no wonder that they &s;hould di&s;gu&s;t the lea&s;t delicate &s;tomach. As for the wild ones, I have eaten them boiled, roa&s;ted, and &s;tewed, and found their fle&s;h white, juicy, and good: the only thing that di&s;gu&s;ted me was, their little hands and their heads, which when dre&s;&s;ed, being deprived of the &s;kin, appeared like the hands and the &s;kull of a young infant. I have already ob&s;erved that there are in Guiana many different &s;pecies, from the
<PB N="166" REF="212">
large ourang-outang to the very &s;mall &s;arcawinkee. The former, however, I never have &s;een, nor heard de&s;cribed, while I was in this country; as for the latter, I &s;hall de|&s;cribe him on another occa&s;ion, and &s;hall only, for the pre&s;ent, give an account of tho&s;e which I met with on this crui&s;e. That which I &s;hot the &s;econd in&s;tant is what is called in Surinam <HI>micoo:</HI> it is nearly the &s;ize of a fox, and of a reddi&s;h grey colour, with a black head and very long tail. Tho&s;e I killed on the tenth were in|deed exceedingly beautiful, and much more delicate when dre&s;&s;ed than the former: they are called the <HI>kee&s;ee-kee&s;ee</HI> by the inhabitants, are about the &s;ize of a rabbit, and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hingly nimble. The colour of their body is reddi&s;h, and the tail, which is long, is black at the ex|tremity; but the fore-feet are orange colour. The head is very round, the face milk white, with a round black patch in the middle, in which are the mouth and the no&s;trils; and this di&s;po&s;ition of the features give it the appearance of a ma&s;k: the eyes are black, and remark|ably lively. The&s;e monkies we &s;aw daily pa&s;s along the &s;ides of the river, &s;kipping from tree to tree, but mo&s;tly about mid-day, and in very numerous bodies, regularly following each other like a little army, with their young ones on their backs, not unlike little knap&s;acks. Their manner of travelling is thus: the foremo&s;t walks to the extremity of a bough, from which it bounds to the extremity of one belonging to the next tree, often at a
<PB REF="213">

<PB N="167" REF="214">
mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;tance, and with &s;uch wonderful ac|tivity and preci&s;ion, that it never once mi&s;&s;es its aim: the others one by one, and even the females, with their little ones on their backs, which &s;tick fa&s;t to the mother, follow their leader, and perform the &s;ame leap with the greate&s;t &s;eeming facility and &s;afety: they al&s;o are re|markable for climbing up the nebees or natural ropes, with which many parts of the fore&s;t are interwoven. The&s;e nebees grow in &s;uch a manner as to afford the ap|pearance at fir&s;t &s;ight of a fleet at anchor.</P>
<P>The monkies, I am told, have &s;ometimes two young ones &s;ucking, like the human &s;pecies. I have been a wit|ne&s;s how the&s;e animals towards &s;un-&s;et a&s;cend to the tops of the palm-trees, &s;ome of which are above one hundred feet in heighth, where they &s;leep &s;afe in the large diverging branches. The <HI>kee&s;ee-kee&s;ee</HI> is &s;uch a beautiful and delicate fond creature, that it is by many people kept as a favourite, when it wears a &s;ilver chain. Be&s;ides its mimic drolleries, it is remarkable for its good-nature and chirruping voice, which pronounces <HI>peeteeco peeteeco</HI> without intermi&s;&s;ion. They are ea&s;ily tamed, and are taken by means of a &s;trong glue made by the Indians, which is &s;omething like our European bird-lime.</P>
<P>The other &s;pecies, of the &s;hooting of which I have ju&s;t given the horrid account, were called by my negroes <HI>monkee-monkee.</HI> The only facts which I can relate farther of them is, that they are in &s;ize between the two former de&s;cribed, and all over black. One circum&s;tance I ought
<PB N="168" REF="215">
not to omit, which is very remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> that one morning I &s;aw from my barge a monkey of this kind come down to the water's edge, rin&s;ing his mouth, and appearing to clean his teeth with one of his fingers: he was fir&s;t di&s;covered by one of the &s;laves, who pointed him out to my great amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall end the &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent, after add|ing that the above animals are &s;ociable, and that they are very tenacious of life, as I have &s;hewn. It is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to mention, that the u&s;ual di&s;tinction between what are called monkies and apes, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the fir&s;t have all tails, of which the latter are dive&s;ted; but never having met with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Guiana any of the latter de&s;cription, I believe them more to be the inhabitants of A&s;ia and Africa, than of the part of the new world di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of South America. The monkies are often mi&s;chievous near the plantations, where they commit depredations on the &s;ugar-canes, &amp;c. yet of this I but one time have been a witne&s;s.</P>
<P>As I am &s;peaking of the animals found in this part of the country, I mu&s;t not omit the otters here, called <HI>ta|vous,</HI> which in the Cormoetibo Creek frequently attract|ed our attention by their di&s;agreeable noi&s;e: as they are amphibious, they live mo&s;tly on fi&s;h; they are about three feet in length, grey-coloured, and all over &s;potted with white; their legs are &s;hort, they are web-footed, and armed with five claws; the head is round, the no&s;e be&s;et with whi&s;kers like a cat; the eyes are &s;mall, and
<PB N="169" REF="216">
placed above the ears; the tail is very &s;hort. This ani|mal moves aukwardly upon land, but in the rivers pro|ceeds with great velocity. In Guiana it is &s;aid there is another &s;pecies of otters, which are much larger, but the&s;e I never &s;aw.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the favourable appearances of the preceding day, I was, on the 24th, exceedingly ill in|deed, not being able to &s;it up in my hammock, under which the black boy Quaco now lay, crying for his ma&s;|ter, and on the following day the poor lad him&s;elf fell &s;ick; at the &s;ame time I was al&s;o obliged to &s;end three men in a fever to Devil's Harwar. As misfortunes often croud together, I received, at this fatal period, the me|lancholy account that the officer, Mr. Owen, was al&s;o dead, having expired on his pa&s;&s;age downwards at the e&s;tate Alica, where he was buried. My en&s;ign, Mr. Cottenburgh, who had &s;ince gone to Paramaribo, died next; and for my&s;elf no better was now to be expected. In the height of a burning fever I now lay, for&s;aken by all my officers and men, without a friend to comfort me, and without a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any kind, except what the poor remaining negro &s;laves could afford me, by boil|ing a little water to make &s;ome tea. In this &s;ituation the reader may judge of the con&s;olation which was afforded me, the very evening when the&s;e accumulated misfor|tunes &s;eemed to threaten our extinction, by the receipt of an order from the Colonel, to come down with both the barges to Devil's Harwar, where I was again to take po&s;t
<PB N="170" REF="217">
on &s;hore, and relieve Captain Orzinga, of the Society &s;er|vice, who with his men was to proceed to La Rochelle in Patamaca, to &s;trengthen the troops already there. Ill as I was, this had &s;uch a powerful effect on my &s;pirits, that I immediately ordered the Cerberus down to the mouth of the Cormoetibo Creek, where &s;he joined me that evening.</P>
<P>On the 26th, we bid farewel to this de&s;tructive place; and having weighed anchor, rowed down as far as Barbacoeba, during which time a circum&s;tance happen|ed, which will probably prove more entertaining than the repeated accounts of &s;ickne&s;s and deaths.</P>
<P>As I was re&s;ting in my hammock, between the pa|roxy&s;ms of my fever, about half way between Cormoe|tibo and Barbacoeba, while the Charon was floating down, the &s;entinel called to me that he had &s;een and challenged &s;omething black and moving in the bru&s;h|wood on the beach, which gave no an&s;wer; but which, from its &s;ize, he concluded mu&s;t be a man. I immedi|ately dropped anchor; and having manned the canoe, ill as I was, I &s;tepped into it, and rowed up to the place mentioned by the &s;entinel. Here we all &s;tepped a&s;hore to reconnoitre, as I &s;u&s;pected it to be no other than a re|bel &s;py, or a &s;traggling party detached by the enemy; but one of my &s;laves, of the name of David, declared it was no negro, but a large amphibious &s;nake, which could not be far from the beach, and I might have an oppor|tunity of &s;hooting it if I plea&s;ed. To this, however, I
<PB N="171" REF="218">
had not the lea&s;t inclination, from the uncommon &s;ize of the creature, from my weakne&s;s, and the difficulty of get|ting through the thicket, which &s;eemed impenetrable to the water's edge; and therefore ordered all of them to return on board. The negro then a&s;ked me liberty to &s;tep forward and &s;hoot it him&s;elf, a&s;&s;uring me it could not be at any great di&s;tance, and warranting me again&s;t all danger. This declaration in&s;pired me with &s;o much pride and emulation, that I determined to take his fir&s;t advice, and kill it my&s;elf; provided he would point it out to me, and be re&s;pon&s;ible for the hazard, by &s;tanding at my &s;ide, from which I &s;wore that if he dared to move, I &s;hould level the piece at him&s;elf, and blow out his own brains.</P>
<P>To this the negro cheerfully agreed; and having loaded my gun with a ball-cartridge, we proceeded; David cut|ting a path with a bill-hook, and a marine following, with three more loaded firelocks to keep in readine&s;s. We had not gone above twenty yards through mud and water, the negro looking every way with an uncommon degree of vivacity and attention; when &s;tarting behind me, he called out, "Me &s;ee &s;nakee!" and in effect there lay the animal, rolled up under the fallen leaves and rubbi&s;h of the trees; and &s;o well covered, that it was &s;ome time before I di&s;|tinctly perceived the head of this mon&s;ter, di&s;tant from me not above &s;ixteen feet, moving its forked tongue, while its eyes, from their uncommon brightne&s;s, ap|peared to emit &s;parks of fire. I now, re&s;ting my piece
<PB N="172" REF="219">
upon a branch, for the purpo&s;e of taking a &s;urer aim, fired; but mi&s;&s;ing the head, the ball went through the body, when the animal &s;truck round, and with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing force as to cut away all the underwood around him with the facility of a &s;cythe mowing gra&s;s; and by flouncing his tail, cau&s;ed the mud and dirt to fly over our heads to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Of this proceeding however we were not torpid &s;pectators, but took to our heels, and crouded into the canoe. The negro now in|treated me to renew the charge, a&s;&s;uring me the &s;nake would be quiet in a few minutes, and at any rate per&s;i&s;t|ing in the a&s;&s;ertion that he was neither able nor inclined to pur&s;ue us; which opinion he &s;upported by walking before me, till I &s;hould be ready to fire. And thus I again undertook to make the trial, e&s;pecially as he &s;aid that his fir&s;t &s;tarting backwards had only proceeded from a de&s;ire to make room for me. I now found the &s;nake a little re|moved from his former &s;tation, but very quiet, with his head as before, lying out among the fallen leaves, rotten bark, and old mo&s;s. I fired at it immediately, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than the other time: and now, being but &s;lightly wounded, he &s;ent up &s;uch a cloud of du&s;t and dirt, as I never &s;aw but in a whirlwind, and made us once more &s;uddenly retreat to our canoe; where now, being heartily tired of the exploit, I gave orders to row towards the barge: but David &s;till intreating me to permit <HI>him</HI> to kill the animal, I was, by his per&s;ua&s;ions, induced to make a third and la&s;t attempt, in company with him.
<PB N="173" REF="220">
Thus, having once more di&s;covered the &s;nake, we di&s;|charged both our pieces at once, and with this good effect, that he was now by one of us &s;hot through the head. David, who was made completely happy by this &s;ucce&s;s|ful conclu&s;ion, ran leaping with joy, and lo&s;t no time in bringing the boat-rope, in order to drag him down to the canoe; but this again proved not a very ea&s;y under|taking, &s;ince the creature, notwith&s;tanding its being mor|tally wounded, &s;till continued to wreath and twi&s;t about, in &s;uch a manner as rendered it dangerous for any per&s;on to approach him. The negro, however, having made a running noo&s;e on the rope, and after &s;ome fruitle&s;s at|tempts to make an approach, threw it over his head with much dexterity; and now, all taking hold of the rope, we dragged him to the beach, and tied him to the &s;tern of the canoe, to take him in tow. Being &s;till alive, he kept &s;wimming like an eel; and I having no reli&s;h for &s;uch a &s;hip-mate on board, who&s;e length (notwith&s;tanding to my a&s;toni&s;hment all the negroes declared it to be but a young one come to about its half growth) I found upon mea&s;uring it to be twenty-two feet and &s;ome inches; and its thickne&s;s about that of my black boy Quaco, who might then be about twelve years old, and round who&s;e wai&s;t I &s;ince mea&s;ured the creature's &s;kin.</P>
<P>Being arrived along-&s;ide of the Charon, the next con|&s;ideration was, how to di&s;po&s;e of this immen&s;e animal; when it was at length determined to bring him on &s;hore at Barbacoeba, to have him &s;kinned, and take out the
<PB N="174" REF="221">
oil, &amp;c. In order to effect this purpo&s;e, the negro David having climbed up a tree with the end of the rope, let it down over a &s;trong forked bough, and the other ne|groes hoi&s;ted up the &s;nake, and &s;u&s;pended him from the tree. This done, David, with a &s;harp knife between his teeth, now left the tree, and clung fa&s;t upon the mon&s;ter, which was &s;till twi&s;ting, and began his operations by ripping it up, and &s;tripping down the &s;kin as he de&s;cend|ed. Though I perceived that the animal was no longer able to do him any injury, I confe&s;s I could not without emotion &s;ee a man &s;tark naked, black and bloody, cling|ing with arms and legs round the &s;limy and yet living mon&s;ter. This labour, however, was not without its u&s;e, &s;ince he not only dexterou&s;ly fini&s;hed the operation, but provided me, be&s;ides the &s;kin, with above four gallons of fine clarified fat, or rather oil, though there was wa&s;ted perhaps as much more. This I delivered to the &s;urgeons at Devil's Harwar, for the u&s;e of the wounded men in the ho&s;pital, for which I received their hearty thanks, it being con&s;idered, particularly for brui&s;es, a very excel|lent remedy. When I &s;ignified my &s;urprize to &s;ee the &s;nake &s;till living, after he was deprived of his inte&s;|tines and &s;kin, Caramaca, the old negro, whether from experience or tradition, a&s;&s;ured me he would not die till after &s;un-&s;et. The negroes now cut him in &s;lices, in order to dre&s;s and fea&s;t upon him, they all declaring that he was exceedingly good and whole&s;ome; but to their

<PB N="175" REF="223">
great mortification I refu&s;ed to give my concurrence, and we rowed down with the &s;kin to Devil's Harwar.</P>
<P>Of this &s;pecies &s;everal &s;kins are pre&s;erved in the Bri|ti&s;h and Mr. Parkin&s;on's Mu&s;eums. It is called by Mr. We&s;tley <HI>Lyboija,</HI> and <HI>Boa</HI> in the Briti&s;h Encyclopoedia, to which publication I refer the reader for a perfect ac|count, and an excellent engraving, of this wonderful creature, which in the colony of Surinam is called <HI>Aboma.</HI> Its length, when full grown, is &s;aid to be &s;ometimes forty feet, and more than four feet in circumference; its colour is a greeni&s;h black on the back; a fine browni&s;h yellow on the &s;ides, and a dirty white under the belly: the back and &s;ides being &s;potted with irregular black rings, with a pure white in the middle. Its head is broad and flat, &s;mall in proportion to the body, with a large mouth, and a double row of teeth: it has two bright prominent eyes; is covered all over with &s;cales, &s;ome about the &s;ize of a &s;hilling; and under the body, near the tail, armed with two &s;trong claws like cock-&s;purs, to help it in &s;eizing its prey. It is an amphibious animal, that is, it delights in low and mar&s;hy places, where it lies coiled up like a rope, and concealed under mo&s;s, rotten timber, and dried leaves, to &s;eize its prey by &s;urprize, which from its immen&s;e bulk it is not active enough to pur&s;ue. When hungry, it will devour any animal that comes within its reach, and is indifferent whether it is a &s;loth, a wild boar, a &s;tag, or even a tiger; round which
<PB N="176" REF="224">
having twi&s;ted it&s;elf by the help of its claws, &s;o that the creature cannot e&s;cape, it breaks, by its irre&s;i&s;tible force, every bone in the animal's body, which it then covers over with a kind of &s;lime or &s;laver from its mouth, to make it &s;lide; and at la&s;t gradually &s;ucks it in, till it di&s;|appears: after this, the <HI>aboma</HI> cannot &s;hift its &s;ituation, on account of the great knob or knot which the &s;wal|lowed prey occa&s;ions in that part of the body where it re&s;ts till it is dige&s;ted; for till then it would hinder the &s;nake from &s;liding along the ground. During that time the <HI>aboma</HI> wants no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I have been told of negroes being devoured by this animal, and am di&s;po&s;ed to credit the account; for &s;hould they chance to come within its reach when hungry, it would as certainly &s;eize them as any other animal. I do not apprehend that its fle&s;h, which is very white, and looks like that of fi&s;h, is in any re&s;pect pernicious to the &s;tomach. I &s;hould have had no objection to the negroes eating it till it was con&s;umed, had I not ob&s;erved a kind of di&s;&s;atisfaction among the remaining marines, who would not have been plea&s;ed with my giving the ne|groes the u&s;e of the kettle to boil it. The bite of this &s;nake is &s;aid not to be venomous; nor do I believe it bites at all from any other impul&s;e than hunger.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that having nailed its &s;kin on the bot|tom of the canoe, and dried it in the &s;un, &s;prinkling it over with wood-a&s;hes to prevent it from corruption, I

&s;ent it to a friend at Paramaribo, whence it was &s;ince &s;ent to Holland as a curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>However extraordinary this account may appear to many readers, let them peru&s;e the narrative which is re|lated by a gentleman in the i&s;land of Ceylon, who &s;aw a tiger killed there by a &s;nake he calls the <HI>anacunda,</HI> but in a quite different manner, and their wonder will cea&s;e.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII.</NOTE>ON the 27th of Augu&s;t I relieved Captain Orzinga with his men, and took the command of Devil's Harwar, having been on board the Charon exactly fifty-&s;ix days, in the mo&s;t wretched condition that can be de|&s;cribed: but I hoped now to get the better of my com|plaint by the help of a few refre&s;hments, &s;uch as milk, &amp;c. which could not be obtained in our former &s;ituation. The Society troops (above one hundred in number) being to &s;et off next day with my empty barges to La Rochelle, in Patamaca, I reviewed my marines, when I found I had left out of five officers but two, who were both &s;ick, the three others being dead; I had al&s;o only one &s;erjeant, two corporals, and fifteen privates, out of fifty-four healthy men, who embarked with me on the 2d day of la&s;t July. This army was not more than &s;ufficient to defend the ho&s;pital, (which was crouded with &s;ick) the ammu|nition and victualling magazine, &amp;c. on a &s;pot where lately had been kept three hundred &s;oldiers, particularly
<PB N="179" REF="227">
while the enemy were certainly lurking not far off: in con&s;ideration of which, the Society Captain reinforced me with twenty of his men. The next evening he en|tertained me and my two &s;ubalterns with a &s;upper of <HI>fre&s;h meat,</HI> both roa&s;t and boiled, to our great comfort and &s;urprize; but which, to my un&s;peakable mortifica|tion, proved to be the individual poor cow with her calf, on whom we had built all our hopes for a little relief. It appeared that one of his &s;entinels, as concerted between them, had &s;hot it by a wilful mi&s;take. Thus did Captain Orzinga, for the &s;ake of a momentary gratification, de|prive us all of that la&s;ting comfort on which we had &s;o much depended, and of which we had &s;o much need, being altogether emaciated for want of whole&s;ome and nutritive food.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 28th the Society troops rowed to Patamaca, when, examining the twenty &s;oldiers they had left me, they proved to be the refu&s;e of the whole, part with agues, wounds, ruptures, and rotten limbs, and mo&s;t of them next day were obliged to enter the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>On the 29th, having ba&s;tonaded my late pilot for &s;tealing from the &s;oldiers, I di&s;patched the information to Colonel Fourgeoud, that I had taken po&s;t, and ac|quainting him with my weak &s;ituation, reque&s;ted a proper reinforcement. In the evening two of my men died.</P>
<P>All things now being regulated and &s;ettled, I thanked Heaven in the expectation of getting &s;ome re&s;t, being

&s;till extremely weak; and with the&s;e cheering hopes re|tired at ten o'clock at night to my hammock; but this tranquillity was again of &s;hort duration, for having &s;carcely clo&s;ed my eyes I was awaked by my &s;erjeant, and the following letter put into my hand, &s;ent by an expre&s;s from the captain of the militia, or bargers in Cottica.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"This is to acquaint you, that the rebels have burnt three e&s;tates by your &s;ide, Suyingheyd, Peru, and L'E&s;|perance, the ruins of which are &s;till &s;moking; and that they have cut the throats of all the white inhabi|tants that fell in their way.

<P>Con&s;cious of my defencele&s;s &s;ituation, I immediately &s;tarted up; and the expre&s;s who brought the letter hav|ing &s;pread the news the moment of his landing, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for beating to arms, &s;ince not only the few &s;oldiers who were well, but the whole ho&s;pital bur&s;t out; and &s;everal of them, in &s;pite of my oppo&s;ition, crawling on their hands and feet to their arms, dropped dead upon the &s;pot.&mdash;May I never behold &s;uch another &s;cene

of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s! Lame, blind, &s;ick, and wounded, in the hope of pre&s;erving a wretched exi&s;tence, ru&s;hed upon certain death! They could only, in a word, be compared to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed army and navy at Cartha|gena, commanded by the Briti&s;h Admiral Vernon, whom Thom&s;on de&s;cribes&mdash;

<P>For my own part, I was in a very weakly condition indeed; however, we continued to lie all night on our arms, during which I pre&s;&s;ed the me&s;&s;enger to &s;tay, in order to add one to our mi&s;erable number, being deter|mined to &s;ell our lives as dearly as po&s;&s;ible. But no enemy appearing in the morning, we buried the dead in their hammocks, not having a board to make a coffin on the whole po&s;t. In this &s;ituation I lo&s;t all patience, and had the audacity to write to my commander, that (be|&s;ides what had happened) my la&s;t men &s;tood upon the brink of the grave, from hard&s;hips and for want of being properly &s;upported; the very waiters of the ho&s;pital having de&s;erted on the moment of my arrival here, and gone to Paramaribo. Our whole number, indeed, was
<PB N="182" REF="230">
now melted down to twelve men, who were to protect twelve buildings, and that with no more than two very &s;mall che&s;ts of ammunition, and no retreat for the &s;ick, as the barges were gone to Patamaca, and the la&s;t canoe di&s;patched with my letter to Colonel Fourgeoud; for I had &s;et adrift that belonging to the expre&s;s, who was a book-keeper of a neighbouring plantation, in order to prevent him or any other from making their e&s;cape. In this &s;ituation, I was now obliged to convert the &s;laves into &s;oldiers: the&s;e I armed with a hatchet, not daring to tru&s;t them with a firelock. For this whole night we again watched under arms, and in the morning found two more of our little party dead on the ground.</P>
<P>I now began really to think we were all devoted to de&s;truction, while the men, regardle&s;s of all order (&s;elf-pre&s;ervation excepted) threw out the mo&s;t bitter invec|tives again&s;t their per&s;ecutor, Fourgeoud, which I could not prevent; nor can I help remarking the general&s;hip of the rebel negroes, who had kept lying quiet till the removal of the Society troops from Devil's Harwar, and &s;eized the very fir&s;t day of their departure, convinced of its being guarded only by my &s;ick and emaciated &s;oldiers, in order to commit their depredations on the Cottica e&s;tates. They well knew that my force was not &s;uffi|cient to pur&s;ue them, nay, hardly to &s;tand in my own defence: all this, however, was but according to my expectation; while, on the contrary, had my &s;trength been &s;ufficient, they could never have e&s;|caped
<PB N="183" REF="231">
at lea&s;t from being cut off in their retreat, e&s;pecially if the troops in Rio Perica had acted con|jointly with tho&s;e in Cottica, by patroling the path between the two rivers, acro&s;s which the rebels were twice unavoidably obliged to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of September we waited once more till morning, and then buried another of my poor men; while I yet cannot conceive how any one was able to &s;urvive &s;uch a &s;eries of toil, in &s;uch a debilitated &s;tate, and in a tropical climate; yet &s;ome did, though few. At length, being per&s;uaded that the rebels mu&s;t have pa&s;t the Cordon, without having thought proper to pay us a vi&s;it on their retreat, I determined to let the remaining few watch no longer, but permit them to die a natural death. At la&s;t, in the evening, when all was too late, there came down by water from the po&s;t La Rochelle to our a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, one officer and ten men.&mdash;I having had but nine left to do the duty at the time of their arrival.</P>
<P>On the 2d another man died; and I once more reviewed my forces, which now amounted exactly to &s;even marines, the few &s;carecrows of the Society excepted; however, the chance of being ma&s;&s;acred by the rebels was at this time over, thanks alone to their pu&s;illanimity, or rather their hurry!</P>
<P>I now received a letter from Colonel Fourgeoud, con|doling with me on the lo&s;s of &s;o many good officers, ac|quainting me that I was to be reinforced; and that on my recommendation my &s;erjeant, Mr. Cubanns, was ap|pointed
<PB N="184" REF="232">
an en&s;ign; which gave me plea&s;ure, and took place at a very &s;uitable time, &s;ince this day my poor En|&s;ign Macdonald was &s;ent down very &s;ick to Paramaribo. I an&s;wered to all this, that I was obliged to him; adding, that while I remained without reinforcement, I could not be accountable for what con&s;equences might happen, in a place where I was left to defend a whole river with none but &s;ick people; and even the&s;e without &s;uffi|cient ammunition, and hourly expiring for want of proper medicines, or a &s;urgeon to attend them, there being none here but one or two &s;urgeon's mates belong|ing to the troops of the Society, who could do little more than occa&s;ionally draw blood, and cut off a beard or a corn.</P>
<P>On the 4th we buried another of my marines, and on the following day another died; and I had not one now remaining who was not ill, or who was not rendered un|&s;erviceable, by his feet being &s;welled with the in&s;ects called <HI>chigoes:</HI> the&s;e poor men were mo&s;tly Germans, who had been accu&s;tomed to a healthy climate in their own country. I began now to be reconciled to putting my la&s;t man under ground, and almo&s;t wi&s;hing to leap into the grave after him my&s;elf; when a barge arrived from Paramaribo with the proper reinforcement, ammu|nition, provi&s;ions, medicines, a &s;urgeon, and an order from my chief to trace out the track of the rebels im|mediately, on the former path of communication called the Cordon, between Cottica and Perica, and to write him
<PB N="185" REF="233">
the re&s;ult of my di&s;coveries; he intimated al&s;o that he intended to keep his magazines at Devil's Harwar, and that I was not to make u&s;e of the &s;pot I had found out for that purpo&s;e at Barbacoeba Creek.</P>
<P>On the 6th I prepared to march my&s;elf, having re|covered a little &s;trength, on the grand project of di&s;|covery, and then placed the ammunition in the ma|gazine.</P>
<P>As the manner of marching in this country is &s;o very different from that in Europe, I &s;hall, before we &s;et out, endeavour briefly to de&s;cribe the nature of the&s;e expedi|tions.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, in Surinam no &s;uch thing is prac|ticable as three or even two ranks; thus there is no marching by divi&s;ions or platoons; &mdash; but the whole party being dre&s;&s;ed in one rank, face to the right, and every man follows his leader, the negro &s;laves inter|&s;per&s;ed between the men, in order to guard their per&s;ons as well as what they carry; and this manner of march|ing is called Indian file. With a detachment of &s;ixty men, con&s;i&s;ting of one captain, two &s;ubalterns, two &s;erjeants, four corporals, one &s;urgeon, and fifty pri|vates, twenty negro &s;laves at lea&s;t ought to be employed, for the u&s;e of whom their ma&s;ters are paid at the rate of two &s;hillings &s;terling a day by the colony; and this is a much greater expence than waggons and hor&s;es would be, which in this country cannot be employed for mili|tary &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="234">The manner of inter&s;per&s;ing them among&s;t the troops is as follows: The foremo&s;t are generally two negroes, with bill-hooks to cut a way, &s;o as to make a practicable path, with one corporal and two men to reconnoitre the front, and, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, to give the alarm; and then one &s;ubaltern, &s;ix privates, and a corporal, form the van. Then follows, at &s;ome di&s;tance, the corps in two divi&s;ions; in the fir&s;t, one captain, one corporal, twelve privates, one &s;urgeon, and two negroes to carry the powder; in the &s;econd, is one &s;erjeant and twelve pri|vates; and then again follows, at &s;ome di&s;tance, the rear guard, con&s;i&s;ting of one &s;ubaltern, one &s;erjeant, one corporal, and eighteen privates, with &s;ixteen negroes to carry the medicines, beef, bread, &s;pades, axes, rum, &amp;c.; the &s;ick al&s;o are carried. The three la&s;t of all being one corporal and two men at a di&s;tance, to give the alarm in ca&s;e of an attack, as the others had orders to do in the front, which ends the train.</P>
<P>Every thing being ready, according to the above rules, for my &s;mall party, which con&s;i&s;ted of my&s;elf, an officer of the Society, Mr. Hert&s;bergh, one &s;urgeon's mate, one guide, two &s;erjeants, two corporals, forty privates, and only eight negro &s;laves to cut open the pa&s;&s;age, and carry the baggage, we faced to the right at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and &s;allied forth into the woods, keeping our cour&s;e directly for the Perica river; and having marched till about eleven o'clock on the Cordon, I di&s;covered, as I had expected,
<PB REF="235">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="187" REF="236">
the track of the rebels by the marks of their foot&s;teps in the mud, by the broken bottles, plantain-&s;hells, &amp;c. and found that by appearance it bore towards Pinne|burgh, already mentioned.</P>
<P>I had now indeed found the ne&s;t, but the birds were flown. We continued our march till eight o'clock, when we arrived at the Society po&s;t Scribo, in Perica, in a mo&s;t &s;hocking condition, having waded through water and mire above our hips, climbed over heaps of fallen trees, and crept underneath on our bellies. This, how|ever, was not the wor&s;t, for our fle&s;h was terribly mangled and torn by the thorns, and &s;tung by the Patat lice, ants, and <HI>wa&s;&s;y-wa&s;&s;y,</HI> or wild bees. This la&s;t is an in&s;ect not larger than an Engli&s;h blue-bottle fly, and is of a black colour, quite different from our bees; they are never kept in hives, but &s;warm wild in the fore&s;t, where they build in hollow trees or between the branches; their ne&s;ts being &s;ometimes as large as an inflated cow's blad|der, to which they bear no bad re&s;emblance, both in colour and &s;moothne&s;s, except in being le&s;s regularly oval; from the&s;e abodes (when the ne&s;t or the branches are inad|vertently touched) thou&s;ands of warriors &s;ally forth; and this little flying army is extremely formidable, pitching always by in&s;tinct on the eyes, lips and hair, whence they cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;lodged; their &s;tings generally cau&s;e a fever, and &s;well the parts &s;o very much that they occa&s;ion blindne&s;s for &s;everal hours; their honey
<PB N="188" REF="237">
is of a dark-brown colour, and &s;o is their wax, but gummy, being both of little value.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t of our &s;ufferings, however, was the fatigue of marching in a burning &s;un, and the la&s;t two hours in total darkne&s;s, holding each other by the hand; and having left ten men behind, &s;ome with agues, &s;ome &s;tung blind, and &s;ome with their feet full of chigoes. Being in the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable manner received at Scribo by the commanding officer, I went to my hammock very ill of a fever.</P>
<P>On the following morning I felt my&s;elf better for my night's re&s;t; but neither my&s;elf nor my men were able to march back, wherefore the other captain &s;ent a &s;mall party of his &s;oldiers to pick up the poor marines I had lo&s;t the day before, and of whom they brought with them &s;even, carried in hammocks tied to poles, each by two negroes, the other three having &s;crambled back to Devil's Harwar.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here I wrote a letter to Colonel Four|geoud, couched in &s;uch terms as few people in their full &s;en&s;es would do to their commanders, <HI>viz.</HI> that I had found the path; that if I had had &s;upport in time I might have cut off the enemy's retreat, in&s;tead of finding their foot-&s;teps only; but that now all was too late, and the party all knocked up to no purpo&s;e. This letter, I have been &s;ince told, incen&s;ed him, as it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, in the highe&s;t degree. Being &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed to renew my march, we left Scribo on the 9th, at four o'clock in
<PB N="189" REF="238">
the morning, and at four o'clock P. M. arrived, after inde&s;cribable &s;ufferings, at Devil's Harwar, covered over with mud and blood, and our legs and thighs cut and torn by the thorns and branches; mo&s;t of the men being without &s;hoes and &s;tockings of nece&s;&s;ity, while I, who had gone this march in the &s;ame condition from choice, had ab&s;olutely &s;uffered the lea&s;t of the whole party, by having inured my&s;elf gradually to walk barefooted on the barges.</P>
<P>At Devil's Harwar, I now found Lieutenant Colonel We&s;terloo and a quarter-ma&s;ter arrived to take the com|mand, his troops not being expected till the next day. I was by this circum&s;tance, however, made exceedingly happy, hoping at la&s;t to meet with &s;ome relief; and having ceded him my written orders, the magazine, ho&s;pital, &amp;c. &amp;c. I &s;tripped and plunged into the river to wa&s;h my&s;elf and take a &s;wim, by which (being before much over-heated) I found my&s;elf greatly refre&s;hed, as well as by receiving a quantity of fine fruit, Jamaica rum, wine and &s;ugar, from Joanna;&mdash;but how did my blood chill, when the quarter-ma&s;ter told me, as a &s;ecret, that my &s;erjeant, one Fowler, having fir&s;t got drunk with my wine, offered violence to this poor woman; and that he was to be at Devil's Harwar next day, when I &s;hould &s;ee the marks of her ju&s;t re&s;entment on his face!</P>
<P>The reader will, I tru&s;t, excu&s;e my violence, when I
<PB N="190" REF="239">
tell him, that I vowed immediate de&s;truction to the villain: and having ordered a negro to cut twelve bamboo canes, I retired like a per&s;on deprived of his &s;en&s;es, determined to puni&s;h him according to his &s;uppo&s;ed crime.</P>
<P>On the 10th there arrived two &s;ubalterns, with a &s;e|cond barge full of men, ammunition, medicine, and pro|vi&s;ions, which having marched into quarters and &s;towed, I &s;ent for the haple&s;s Fowler, who&s;e face being in three places wounded, I locked him up in a room, and, with|out a&s;king one que&s;tion, broke &s;ix of the bamboos over his head, till he e&s;caped all bloody out at the window, and my re&s;entment gradually abated. He certainly had &s;uffered much, but nothing equal to what were my &s;en&s;ations, at being &s;till further informed, that Colonel Fourgeoud had &s;eized all my effects, which he had &s;ealed and locked up in an empty &s;tore|room, in expectation of my decea&s;e, which, according to all appearances, might be looked for; while my hou&s;e was given to another, by which means I could not procure &s;o much as a clean &s;hirt to relieve me from my di&s;graceful tatters: neverthele&s;s, by the hope of going down my&s;elf, my &s;pirits were &s;upported. The other news, of more importance, was, that the hero in per&s;on, with mo&s;t of the troops, had at la&s;t left Parama|ribo; that he had quartered them partly at Devil's Harwar, in Rio Cottica, the e&s;tate Bellaiz, in Rio Pe|rica,
<PB N="191" REF="240">
and at the e&s;tates Charenbeck, and Crava&s;&s;ibo, in Rio Commewina; whence, conjunctly with the troops of the Society and the Rangers, he intended to move in que&s;t of the rebels; that he had al&s;o ordered all the barges to be relieved at la&s;t, and their remaining troops to reinforce the above-mentioned po&s;ts, which I mu&s;t re|mark was a very wi&s;e and well-planned regulation.</P>
<P>From Patamaca we were informed, that the rebels, on their repa&s;&s;ing the river above La Rochelle, had again de&s;troyed a &s;mall e&s;tate, and murdered its proprietor, a Mr. Nyboor.</P>
<P>It was either about this time, or very &s;hortly after, that an over&s;eer e&s;caped by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a negro boy, who, de&s;iring him to leap into a canoe, and lie down flat upon his belly, leaped him&s;elf into the water, where, by &s;wim|ming with one hand, and guiding the canoe with the other, he ferried his ma&s;ter &s;afe over the creek Pata|maca, through a &s;hower of mu&s;quet bullets, the rebels firing upon them all the while, but without execution; however, for this material piece of &s;ervice, he was re|compen&s;ed the week after with three hundred la&s;hes by the &s;ame ma&s;ter, only for having forgotten to open one of the &s;luices or flood-gates.&mdash;On this act of inhumanity I &s;hall make no comment, but proceed to my own mi&s;er|able &s;ituation. Having remon&s;trated with Lieutenant Colonel We&s;terloo on the &s;tate of my health, which di&s;abled me from joining the corps on their march,
<PB N="192" REF="241">
I reque&s;ted that I might be removed to Paramaribo for the chance of recovery; but this he peremptorily refu&s;ed to allow me, by Colonel Fourgeoud's expre&s;s command. The refu&s;al of &s;o rea&s;onable a reque&s;t made me almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and agitated my &s;pirits &s;o much, that on the morning of the 12th, determined to exchange my wretched exi&s;tence one way or other, I in&s;i&s;ted on being immediately removed, or wi&s;hed for <HI>death,</HI> which the &s;urgeons declared mu&s;t be the con&s;equence &s;oon, if I was not permitted to go down, and in the meanwhile I vowed that I &s;hould attribute my decea&s;e to their unprecedented barbarity. A con&s;ultation was now held on the &s;ubject; and at la&s;t, not without great difficulties, a boat was ordered to row me down to Paramaribo, but no white &s;ervant was permitted to attend me. Thus leaving the Lieutenant Colonel em|ployed in fortifying Devil's Harwar with palli&s;adoes, where now al&s;o was a numerous garri&s;on, I at twelve o'clock at noon walked to the water-&s;ide, &s;upported by a negro, on who&s;e &s;houlder I re&s;ted, till I at length &s;tepped into the boat, followed by my black boy Quaco, and finally left the diabolical &s;pot where I had buried &s;o many brave fellows.</P>
<P>On the 14th, having rowed day and night, at two o'clock in the morning, we arrived at the town, ex|tremely ill indeed; where, having no re&s;idence of my own, I was ho&s;pitably received at the hou&s;e of a Mr.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX.</NOTE>SEPTEMBER 15th, I found my&s;elf in an ele|gant and well-furni&s;hed apartment, encouraged by the hopes given by the phy&s;ician, care&s;&s;ed by my friends, and &s;upported by the care and attention of my incompa|rable Mulatto.</P>
<P>A Captain Brant having at this time the command in Colonel Fourgeoud's ab&s;ence, he &s;ent, the morning after my arrival, my trunks and baggage, which had been &s;ealed up; but on looking into them, I found I had ene|mies at home as well as abroad; &s;ince mo&s;t of my &s;hirts, books, &amp;c. were gnawed to du&s;t by the blatta or cock|roach, called <HI>cakreluce</HI> in Surinam: nay, even my &s;hoes were de&s;troyed, of which I had brought with me twelve pairs new from Europe, as they were extremely dear and bad in this country.</P>
<P>This in&s;ect, which is of the beetle kind, is here one inch and &s;ometimes two inches long, oval, flat, and of a dark reddi&s;h colour. By getting through the locks of che&s;ts or boxes, it not only depo&s;its its eggs there, but commits its ravages on linen, cloth, &s;ilk, or any thing that
<PB N="195" REF="244">
comes in its way; by getting al&s;o into the victuals and drink of every kind, it renders them extremely loath&s;ome, for it leaves the mo&s;t nau&s;eous &s;mell, wor&s;e indeed than that of a bug. As mo&s;t We&s;t-India ve&s;&s;els (e&s;pecially tho&s;e loaded with &s;ugar) bring them home in great quan|tities, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing more concerning them, only that they are &s;eldom &s;een to fly, but creep very fa&s;t; and that the be&s;t, and I think the only way to keep the boxes free from them is, to place them on four empty wine bottles kept free from du&s;t, which, by their &s;moothne&s;s, prevent the in&s;ects a&s;cending to get through the key-holes, or even the &s;malle&s;t openings in the bottoms; but this precaution had been neglected by my good friend Colonel Fourgeoud. I found, however, linen &s;ufficient for pre&s;ent u&s;e, and by the indu&s;try of Joanna I was &s;oon provided with a new &s;tock. None can conceive the comfort I felt in being properly dre&s;&s;ed and &s;hifted; my mental faculties were recruiting apace, and I felt with gratitude the ble&s;&s;ing of a &s;trong con&s;titution; but poor Macdonald was &s;till ill at Mr. Kennedy's, who had hu|manely afforded him an a&s;ylum on his return from Devil's Harwar.</P>
<P>Having now time, I inquired concerning Fowler's con|duct; when, to my infinite &s;urprize, I was informed that he had indeed got drunk, as was reported to me, by which he had fallen among&s;t the bottles and cut his face, but that he never had attempted the &s;malle&s;t rudene&s;s: &s;o much indeed was his conduct the rever&s;e of what
<PB N="196" REF="245">
had been reported, that his inebriety had proceeded from his re&s;entment at &s;eeing both me and Joanna ill treated, and my property tran&s;ported away again&s;t his inclina|tion. I was now extremely chagrined at my pa&s;t con|duct, and was gently reproved by the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of it, to whom I promi&s;ed to be Fowler's friend for ever after&mdash; and I kept my word. My fever was now much abated, but I was infe&s;ted with another di&s;order peculiar to this climate, and which I am afraid I &s;hall but indifferently de&s;cribe: it is called in Surinam the ring-worm, and con&s;i&s;ts of long &s;carlet irregular &s;pots, particularly on the under parts of the body, which increa&s;e in magnitude from day to day, unle&s;s prevented by timely applica|tion. Tho&s;e &s;pots are &s;urrounded with a kind of hard callous border, and are as trouble&s;ome by their itching as the prickly heat, or the &s;ting of the mu&s;quitoes; and &s;o very infectious is this complaint, that if any per&s;on &s;eats him&s;elf by chance on a chair immediately after an|other who has the di&s;order, he is almo&s;t certain to be infected with it: it is, I believe, very difficult to get rid of; but the be&s;t cure is to rub the &s;pots with a compo&s;i|tion of refined &s;alt-petre, benzoin, flower of brim&s;tone, and white mercury, mixed with fre&s;h butter or hog's|lard. The numerous inconveniencies to which the inha|bitants of this climate are expo&s;ed, are almo&s;t incon|ceivable.</P>
<P>On the 26th I had a relap&s;e, and was twice bled in one day. I was al&s;o this morning vi&s;ited by poor Mr. Hena|man,
<PB N="197" REF="246">
a young volunteer I have not before mentioned, who looked like a gho&s;t, and was left &s;ick at Paramaribo to manage for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the 2d of October I was a little better, and was ex|alted from living like a &s;avage, to the temporary command of a few troops left at <HI>Paramaribo,</HI> Captain Brant being ordered to join Fourgeoud in Rio Comewina; when the colours, regiment's ca&s;h, &amp;c. were tran&s;mitted to my own lodging, and a &s;entinel placed before my door.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t exerci&s;e I made of my power was to di&s;charge the &s;our wine, which had been bought for the &s;ick offi|cers as well as the men, whom I &s;upplied, from the mo|ney now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with good whole&s;ome claret; but I was &s;orry not to be able al&s;o to exchange the &s;alt beef, pork, and pea&s;e, that were left at the <HI>ho&s;pital,</HI> for fre&s;h provi&s;ions. This &s;tep was however particularly forbidden by the commander; while the butter, chee&s;e, and tobacco were taken away, for which they got one quart of oil among&s;t ten, and their bread reduced to two pounds each man for a whole week. As to the officers, they were left to &s;hift for them&s;elves, or &s;ubmit to the &s;ame allowance, notwith&s;tanding they kept on paying their quota to a regimental me&s;s, which now no longer exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>On the 3d, I took the air for the fir&s;t time on hor&s;e|back, in company with Mr. Henaman, though we could not ride above three Engli&s;h miles di&s;tance out of town, on a &s;pecies of gravel that leads to the Wanica Path, which I have already mentioned as communicating with
<PB N="198" REF="247">
the river Seramica, and as the only pa&s;&s;able road in the colony. During this little ride, which (on account of the dry &s;ea&s;on being commenced) we took at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we ob&s;erved a great number of tho&s;e large and elegant birds, known by the name of <HI>macaws,</HI> but in Surinam called ravens, from their proportion to the parrots, which may be looked upon as a kind of tropical crows.</P>
<P>The macaws are divided into different &s;pecies, of which I &s;hall only de&s;cribe two, wi&s;hing to &s;ay nothing for which I have not competent authority, as I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve too many authors have done, among whom are men of genius and learning: &s;ome indeed may have erred from ignorance or wrong information, but num|bers for the gratification of vanity have, I fear, been guilty of impo&s;ing on the too credulous public.</P>
<P>The blue and yellow macaw is as large as a barn-door fowl, with &s;hort legs and a crooked bill, like that of the common parrot; the former dark coloured, with four black claws, two before and two behind; the latter al&s;o black, the upper mandible alone moveable. Its tail is like a wedge, and con&s;i&s;ts of a few very long and &s;trait feathers. The back of this bird, from the head (the top of which is a &s;ea-green) to the extremity of the tail, is a mo&s;t beautiful azure blue, and, underneath, its whole body is of a pale orange colour; round its eyes it is per|fectly white, inter&s;per&s;ed with black rings, compo&s;ed of very &s;mall feathers.</P>
<P>The other is called in Surinam the <HI>Amazon macaw.</HI>
<PB REF="248">

<PB N="199" REF="249">
This is rather le&s;s than the former; its tail, legs, and bill, are formed in the &s;ame manner, but the latter is of a dirty white; the head, the neck, and brea&s;t of this bird are of a bright &s;carlet, the &s;pace round the eyes only excepted, where it is white, with black rings; its wings may be &s;aid to be divided by bars into four colours, being &s;carlet at the top, next green, then yellow and blue, down to the extremity of the tail, which in the &s;un &s;hines with a brilliancy and effect unequalled by art. The macaws fly in couples, and have a &s;hrill di&s;agreeable &s;hriek, and bite &s;everely; their bill being very hard and &s;harp, which is of great u&s;e to them in climbing: they are ea&s;ily tamed, and may be taught to &s;peak like other parrots. The Indians frequently bring them to Para|maribo, where they part with them for a bottle of rum, or for a few fi&s;h-hooks.</P>
<P>This evening arrived &s;ick, from the head-quarters at the e&s;tate Crawa&s;ibo in Comewina, Colonel Texier, the commanding officer of the Society troops. This gentle|man had intended to have marched conjunctly with Colonel Fourgeoud through the woods, in que&s;t of the rebels; but his con&s;titution, already weak, not being able to &s;upport the regimen of the commander in chief, and to live only on &s;alt provi&s;ions, had begun to flag from the beginning, till he was &s;ent home to Paramaribo, in this drooping condition.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth of October the fever had left me, and the ring-worms began to abate; but the mi&s;ery and hard|&s;hips
<PB N="200" REF="250">
which I had &s;o lately undergone &s;till had an effect upon my con&s;titution, and enormous boils broke out on my left thigh, which entirely prevented me from walk|ing. My phy&s;ician, however, ordering me daily to take the air, I had an opportunity this day of waiting on his excellency the Governor of the colony, by the help of my friend Kennedy's chai&s;e; and as I returned homeward, I &s;topped the carriage at the water-&s;ide, to behold a group of human beings, who had &s;trongly attracted my attention. This group I &s;hall circum&s;tantially endea|vour to de&s;cribe. They were a drove of newly-im|ported negroes, men and women, with a few children, who were ju&s;t landed from on board a Guinea &s;hip that lay at anchor in the roads, to be &s;old for &s;laves. The whole party was &s;uch a &s;et of &s;carcely animated automa|tons, &s;uch a re&s;urrection of &s;kin and bones, as forcibly reminded me of the la&s;t trumpet. The&s;e objects ap|peared that moment to be ri&s;en from the grave, or e&s;caped from Surgeon's Hall; and I confe&s;s I can give no better de&s;cription of them, than by comparing them to walk|ing &s;keletons covered over with a piece of tanned leather.</P>

<P><PB N="201" REF="252">Before the&s;e wretches, which might be in all about &s;ixty in number, walked a &s;ailor, and another followed behind with a bamboo-rattan; the one &s;erving as a &s;hep|herd to lead them along, and the other as his dog to worry them occa&s;ionally, &s;hould any one lag behind, or wander away from the flock. At the &s;ame time, how|ever, equity demands the acknowledgment, that in&s;tead of all tho&s;e horrid and dejected countenances which are de&s;cribed in pamphlets and news-papers, I perceived not one &s;ingle downca&s;t look among&s;t them all; and I mu&s;t add, that the puni&s;hment of the bamboo was inflicted with the utmo&s;t moderation by the &s;ailor who brought up the rear.</P>
<P>Having viewed this &s;ad a&s;&s;emblage of my fellow-crea|tures with amazement, I drove home to my lodgings in a &s;tate of perfect humiliation; where I noted down, as I could learn it from the be&s;t authority, both white and black, what is really the fate of the&s;e people, from the la&s;t moment of their liberty in Africa, to the pre&s;ent pe|riod of their &s;lavery in America: and this I &s;hall en|deavour to relate, preceded by a few of my own unbia&s;&s;ed &s;entiments upon the Slave Trade, which has lately been the object of both public and private inve&s;tigation; and this, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall do with that candour and impartiality which not only every gentleman, but every man, &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, Will you, for the &s;ake of drinking rum,
<PB N="202" REF="253">
and &s;weetening your coffee with &s;ugar, per&s;evere in the mo&s;t unju&s;t and execrable barbarity?&mdash;To this it is an|&s;wered, Take care, le&s;t, under the enthu&s;ia&s;m of hu|manity, you do not, at the expence of your neighbour, and perhaps of your country, incon&s;iderately give up <HI>your</HI> advantages, without the lea&s;t chance of benefiting or improving the condition of tho&s;e, whom I mo&s;t heartily join with you in calling our brethren.</P>
<P>After &s;o many volumes which, within a few years, have been written on this &s;ubject, it may appear great pre|&s;umption in me to offer my poor opinion: but I have made it a rule, among the various &s;ubjects I have mentioned, to dwell on tho&s;e only to which I have been an eye-wit|ne&s;s; and which I am convinced there are few others in this country that have &s;een and &s;o accurately ob&s;erved. I have &s;een the mo&s;t cruel tortures inflicted, for &s;ubmit|ting to the de&s;ire of a hu&s;band, or for refu&s;ing the &s;ame to a libidinous ma&s;ter, and more frequently a ra&s;cally over|&s;eer: nay, even on the mo&s;t innocent, from the fal&s;e ac|cu&s;ations of a lu&s;tful woman, prompted alone by jealou&s;y. I have &s;een in other places, negro &s;laves as well treated as the mo&s;t favoured &s;ervants in England; and as I have &s;een &s;ome &s;ailors, &s;oldiers, and apprentices, mo&s;t tyran|nically treated when under the command of ill-tempered de&s;pots, I mu&s;t pronounce the condition of &s;uch not to be envied even by negroes. If, therefore, &s;o much depends on the di&s;po&s;ition or humour of tho&s;e who are exerci&s;ing a
<PB N="203" REF="254">
permanent or a temporary power, we mu&s;t duly con|&s;ider, before we ha&s;tily judge the whole from partial in|formation.</P>
<P>Cruelty is too often exerci&s;ed in <HI>our</HI> plantations; but if not &s;o &s;hockingly to human nature as in other coun|tries, what are we doing by a &s;udden emancipation, but turning the poor creatures over to more cruel ma&s;ters? The quantum of &s;ugar, &amp;c. will be had, and mu&s;t be pro|vided by negroes, natives of Africa, who alone are born to endure labour under a vertical &s;un.</P>
<P>The national character of the&s;e people, as I have re|marked it, where they are as free to act by their own will and di&s;po&s;ition as in Africa, is perfectly &s;avage; the twenty thou&s;and Ouca and Seramica free negroes have lived &s;e|parated, and under no controul of Europeans, for a num|ber of years, and yet I have never &s;een any marks of civilization, order, or government among them, but, on the contrary, many examples of ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion, debauchery, and indolence.</P>
<P>I love the African negroes, and have &s;hewn how &s;in|cerely I have felt for them on many occa&s;ions; and what|ever wrong con&s;truction may be put on what I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject, I wi&s;h, from the bottom of my heart, that my words could be &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of that re&s;pectable body the Briti&s;h parliament; and &s;o far be regarded, as to prevent the fatal deci&s;ion of a total abolition of &s;lavery till 1800, or the beginning of next
<PB N="204" REF="255">
century. For if &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould be ra&s;hly en|forced, I take the liberty to prophe&s;y, that thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands, both white and black, may repent, and more be ruined by it, when the evil can no more be redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>From what I have learned by inquiry, from per&s;ons well informed on the &s;ubject, it clearly appears, that numbers of the negroes offered for &s;ale have been taken in battles, and made pri&s;oners of war; while many others have been &s;candalou&s;ly kidnapped, and &s;ome others tran&s;ported for offences, &amp;c.; of all which I &s;hall produce a few examples in future.</P>
<P>The&s;e groups of people are marched from every in|land part, to the factories erected by different nations upon the coa&s;t, where they are &s;old, or more properly &s;peaking, bartered, like the other productions of their country, <HI>viz.</HI> gold, elephants teeth, &amp;c. to the Europeans, for bars of iron, fire-arms, carpenters tools, che&s;ts, linens, hats, knives, gla&s;&s;es, tobacco, &s;pirits, &amp;c. Next they are embarked for exportation, during which time they, without contradiction, feel all the pangs that mental or corporeal mi&s;ery can inflict. Being torn from their coun|try and deare&s;t connections, &s;towed hundreds together in a dark &s;tinking hold, the &s;exes being &s;eparated; while the men are kept in chains to prevent an in&s;urrection. In this manner are they floated over turbulent &s;eas, not cer|tain what is to be their de&s;tiny, and generally fed during
<PB N="205" REF="256">
the pa&s;&s;age with hor&s;e-beans and oil for their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. But the&s;e &s;ufferings are often alleviated with better food by the more humane: &s;o far, that none or few of the cargo die during the pa&s;&s;age, and the whole crew ar|rive healthy in the We&s;t Indies. I even remember one in&s;tance, where the captain, mate, and mo&s;t of the &s;ailors, having expired at &s;ea, &s;o that the remaining few could not work the &s;hip without the negroes a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, yet the&s;e la&s;t having been well treated, helped at la&s;t to run the ve&s;&s;el on &s;hore, by which means they not only &s;aved many lives, but tamely and even chear|fully allowed them&s;elves to be fetched and &s;old to any per&s;on who would plea&s;e to buy them.&mdash;Having made the&s;e reflections, I &s;hall now briefly proceed with the manner in which the &s;laves are di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner is a Guinea-&s;hip arrived, than all the &s;laves are led upon deck, where they are refre&s;hed with pure air, plantains, bananas, oranges, &amp;c. and being properly cleaned, wa&s;hed, and their hair &s;haved in different figures of &s;tars, half-moons, &amp;c. which they generally do the one to the other, (having no razors) by the help of a broken bottle and without &s;oap. After this operation, one part of them is &s;ent a&s;hore for &s;ale, decorated with pieces of cotton to &s;erve as fig-leaves, arm-bands, beads, &amp;c. being all the captain's property; while the others &s;pend the day in dancing, hallooing, and clapping hands on board the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="257">Having &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed their figures after land|ing, we now may &s;uppo&s;e them walking along the water-&s;ide, and through the &s;treets, where every planter picks out that number which he &s;tands in need of, to &s;upply tho&s;e lo&s;t by death or de&s;ertion, and begins to make a bargain with the captain. Good negroes are ge|nerally valued at from fifty to a hundred pounds each. Among&s;t the&s;e, &s;hould a woman chance to be pregnant, her price is augmented accordingly, for which rea&s;on I have known the captain of a Dutch Guinea ve&s;&s;el, who acknowledged him&s;elf to be the father, take advantage, with a brutality &s;carcely credited in the &s;tory of Inkle and Yarico, of doubling the value, by &s;elling his own off|&s;pring to the be&s;t bidder; for which however he was highly cen&s;ured by his companions.</P>
<P>The next circum&s;tance that takes place before the bar|gain is &s;truck, is to cau&s;e the negroes for &s;ale, one after another, to mount on a hog&s;head or a table, where they are vi&s;ited by a &s;urgeon, who obliges them to make all the different ge&s;tures, with arms and legs, of a Merry-Andrew upon the &s;tage, to prove their &s;oundne&s;s or un|&s;oundne&s;s; after which they are adopted by the buyer, or rejected, as he finds them fit for his purpo&s;e, or other|wi&s;e. If he keeps them, the money is paid down; and the new-bought negroes are immediately branded on the brea&s;t or the thick part of the &s;houlder, by a &s;tamp made of &s;ilver, with the initial letters of the new ma&s;ter's name,
<PB N="207" REF="258">
as we mark furniture or any thing el&s;e to authenticate them properly. The&s;e hot letters, which are about the &s;ize of a &s;ix-pence, occa&s;ion not that pain which may be imagined, and the bli&s;ters being rubbed directly with a little fre&s;h butter, are perfectly well in the &s;pace of two or three days. No &s;ooner is this ceremony over, and a new name given to the newly-bought &s;lave, than he or &s;he is delivered to an old one of the &s;ame &s;ex, and &s;ent to the e&s;tate, where each is properly kept clean by his guar|dian, in&s;tructed and well fed, without working, for the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks; during which period, from living &s;keletons, they become plump and fat, with a beautiful clean &s;kin, till it is disfigured by the inhuman flogging of &s;ome ra&s;cally proprietor, or rather his over&s;eer.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t leave them for &s;ome time, and continue my narrative, after ob&s;erving that the negroes are com|po&s;ed of different nations or ca&s;ts, &s;uch as the

to the be&s;t bidder. After what has been related, the reader may form &s;ome judgment of my &s;urprize and con|fu&s;ion, when I found among them my ine&s;timable Joanna; the &s;ugar-e&s;tate Fauconberg, with its whole &s;tock, being this day &s;old by an execution, for the benefit of the creditors of its late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, Mr. D.

<P>I now felt all the horrors of the damn'd. I bewailed again and again my unlucky fortune, that did not enable me to become her proprietor my&s;elf, and in my mind I continually painted her en&s;uing dreadful &s;ituation. I fancied I &s;aw her tortured, in&s;ulted, and bowing under the weight of her chains, calling aloud, but in vain, for my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I was mi&s;erable, and indeed nearly deprived of all my faculties, till re&s;tored by the a&s;&s;urances of my friend, Mr. Lolkens, who providentially was appointed to continue admini&s;trator of the e&s;tate during the ab&s;ence of its new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Pa&s;&s;elege</HI> and &s;on, at Am|&s;terdam, who bought it and its dependants for only four thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he confirmed in his appointment, than this di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;teady friend brought Joanna to my pre&s;ence; and pledged him&s;elf, that in every &s;er|vice which he could render to my&s;elf or her, and which he had now more in his power than ever, no efforts on his &s;ide &s;hould be wanting. This promi&s;e I de&s;ired him to keep in remembrance, and accordingly he ever &s;ince mo&s;t nobly per&s;evered.</P>

Thus was I determined properly to avail my&s;elf of my command, which at be&s;t could but la&s;t a few days longer.</P>
<P>This evening my friend De La Mara took his depar|ture, with his twenty-five free mulattoes, for the river Surinam; he being a captain of the militia, and they be|ing infinitely preferable to the European &s;carecrows.</P>
<P>I was &s;o far recovered as to be able to ride out every morning, when the following ludicrous adventure hap|pened to me on the road that leads to Wanica. In this place a Mr. Van de Velde, boa&s;ting how fa&s;t his hor&s;e could gallop, propo&s;ed to me to run a race; to which I agreed, allowing him the &s;tart at twenty paces di&s;tance.

<P>On the 18th arrived &s;ick from Devil's Harwar En&s;ign Mathew, one of the officers by whom I had been re|lieved; and the &s;ame day he was followed by his com|mander and friend, Colonel We&s;terloo, &s;upported by two &s;oldiers. They had ridiculed me for complaining, after a confinement of &s;o many weeks on board the barges; while the&s;e gentlemen had been out but a few days and always on &s;hore, the latter of them having attempted to accompany the old Colonel Fourgeoud to Wana (whom he had joined at La Rochelle in Patamaca) but was com|pletely unfitted for proceeding by his very fir&s;t entry into the woods. I was at dinner with a Mr. Day, when I &s;aw him pa&s;s by a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle, and chu&s;ing to forget what had pa&s;&s;ed at Devil's Harwar, and in reality having a regard for this gentleman, I &s;tarted up imme|diately, and got him a coach, in which I accompanied him to his lodgings, where, having placed a centinel be|fore his chamber-door to keep out the rabble, I &s;ent for
<PB N="212" REF="263">
a Doctor Van Dam, as well as a Doctor Ri&s;&s;am, an Ame|rican, to attend him, forbidding all other communication, that of an old negro woman, his man &s;ervant, and a black boy excepted, and by the&s;e means I apparently pre&s;erved his life.</P>
<P>On the 20th, Lieutenant Count de Randwyk came down al&s;o indi&s;po&s;ed with En&s;ign Coene, and at la&s;t my poor old &s;hipmate Lieutenant Hamer, who had been kept at Devil's Harwar near four months, till, overcome by di&s;ea&s;e, he obtained leave to be tran&s;ported to Parama|ribo.</P>
<P>On the 22d, the governor &s;ent me a cotton twig, which I copied; and as I cannot have a better opportunity, I will now proceed to a de&s;cription of that u&s;eful plant, which has only been cultivated in Surinam from about the year 1735, but not with advantage till about the years 1750 or 1752. There are &s;everal &s;pecies of the cotton-tree, but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to that which is the mo&s;t common and the mo&s;t u&s;eful in this colony. This &s;pecies of cotton, which grows upon a tree about &s;ix or eight feet high, bears before it is a year old, and pro|duces two crops annually, each of about twenty ounces in weight; the leaves are &s;omething like tho&s;e of the vine, of a bright green, and the fibres of a cinnamon colour. The cotton-balls, &s;ome of which are as large as a &s;mall hen's egg, and divided in three parts, grow on a very long &s;talk, and in a triangular pod, which is fir&s;t
<PB N="213" REF="264">
produced by a yellow flower, and when ripe opens of it&s;elf, and di&s;clo&s;es the globular contents as white as flakes of &s;now; in the middle of the&s;e are contained &s;mall black &s;eeds, formed not unlike tho&s;e that are u&s;ually found in grapes. The cotton will pro&s;per in any of the tropical &s;oils, and produces a good profit if the crops are not &s;poiled by a too long rainy &s;ea&s;on, being cultivated with very little trouble and expence: all indeed that is required is, to plant the &s;eeds at a little di&s;tance from each other, when each &s;eed, as I have &s;aid, produces the fir&s;t year it is put in the ground. The &s;eparation of the &s;eeds from the pulp, is the work of one man only, by the help of a machine made for the purpo&s;e; after which the cot|ton has undergone all the nece&s;&s;ary proce&s;s, and is put in bales of between three and four hundred pounds weight each for tran&s;portation, which bales ought to be well moi&s;tened at the time of &s;towing it, to prevent the cotton from &s;ticking to the canvas. In the year before my ar|rival in Surinam, near three thou&s;and bales of cotton were exported from this colony to Am&s;terdam and Rot|terdam alone, which produced about forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The be&s;t e&s;tates make twenty-five thou&s;and pounds weight. The average prices have been from eight pence to twenty-two pence per pound. The raw material is &s;pun in the We&s;t Indies by a rock and &s;pindle, and extremely fine, when by the negro girls it is knit into &s;tockings, &amp;c. one pair of which are
<PB N="214" REF="265">
&s;ometimes &s;old for the price of a Portugue&s;e joe, or &s;ome|times for two guineas. The Indians or natives of Gui|ana make very good hammocks of cotton, which they barter with the inhabitants at Paramaribo for other com|modities.&mdash;In the annexed plate <HI>A</HI> is the twig it&s;elf, <HI>B</HI> the pod, <HI>C</HI> the cotton-ball, and <HI>D</HI> the &s;eed, but on a &s;maller &s;cale than nature. I &s;hould here al&s;o de&s;cribe the coffee, cacao, &s;ugar, and indigo plantations, but mu&s;t re&s;erve them till another occa&s;ion, having made it a rule to &s;peak of things only as they occur, which is more plea&s;ant to my&s;elf, and better adapted to diver&s;ify my narrative.</P>
<P>Being now perfectly recovered, I re&s;olved to join Colonel Fourgeoud at the Wana Creek, without waiting his or|ders, and to accompany him on his excur&s;ions through the fore&s;t: in con&s;equence of which, having fir&s;t cropt my hair, as being more convenient in the woods as well as more cleanly, and provided my&s;elf with the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;h-equipage, &s;uch as jackets, trow&s;ers, &amp;c.; I waited on the governor to a&s;k his commands; he entertained me in a mo&s;t polite manner, and told me, that what I was now going to &s;uffer would &s;urpa&s;s what I had already undergone. I neverthele&s;s per&s;i&s;ted in wi&s;hing to go without waiting an order from the chief, and accordingly applied to the magi&s;trates for a boat, and the nece&s;&s;ary negroes to tran&s;port me; which being promi&s;ed for the &s;ucceeding day, I transferred the colours and regiment's ca&s;h, with the command of the remaining &s;ick troops, to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X.</NOTE>ON the 25th of October, being ready to proceed upon my &s;econd campaign, I repaired to the water-&s;ide at &s;ix o'clock in the evening; where, in&s;tead of a tent boat, I found a grea&s;y yawl, with a few drunken Dutch &s;ailors, to row me to an e&s;tate in the river Come|wina, whence they were going to bring their captain back to Paramaribo, and from which place I might, if I plea&s;ed, beg the re&s;t of my pa&s;&s;age upwards, or manage for my&s;elf in the be&s;t manner I was able. I had already one foot in the boat, when, reflecting that I was going voluntarily on a hazardous expedition, without orders, and only from a de&s;ire to &s;erve an ungrateful people, I repented, and &s;tepped back upon the &s;hore, where, po&s;i|tively declaring I would not move in their defence till I &s;hould be decently tran&s;ported, &s;hould the whole colony be on fire, I was &s;econded by all the Engli&s;h and Ame|ricans in the town, and a general tumult took place. The Dutch exclaimed again&s;t the expence of a tent-boat
<PB N="217" REF="269">
which would co&s;t them thirty &s;hillings, when they could have the other for nothing; while the others de|clared they were a &s;et of mean and par&s;imonious wretches, who de&s;erved not the &s;malle&s;t protection from Colonel Fourgeoud's troops. A mob collected, and a riot en&s;ued, before Mr. Hardegen's tavern, at the water-&s;ide, while hats, wigs, bottles, and gla&s;&s;es, flew out at his windows. The magi&s;trates were next &s;ent for, but to no purpo&s;e: and the fighting continued in the &s;treet till ten o'clock at night, when I with my friends fairly kept the field, having knocked down &s;everal &s;ailors, planters, Jews, and over&s;eers, and lo&s;t one of my pi&s;tols, which I threw after the rabble in a pa&s;&s;ion; nor would it have ended here, had not my friend Mr. Kennedy, who was member of the Court of Policy, and two or three more gentlemen whom he brought with him, found means to appea&s;e the di&s;putants, by declaring I had been very ill treated, and &s;hould have a proper boat the next day.</P>
<P>Having now &s;lept and refre&s;hed my&s;elf a few hours, I was waited on by four American captains, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain Timmons of the Harmony, Captain Lewis of the Peggy, Captain Bogard of the Olive Branch, and Captain Minet of the America, who in&s;i&s;ted on my refu&s;ing any ve&s;&s;el whatever from the colony this time, and offering to &s;end me up in one of their own boats, manned by their own &s;ailors only, to which each would equally contribute. I can aver, that notwith&s;tanding the threatening rupture between Great Britain and her Colonies, which &s;eemed
<PB N="218" REF="270">
then upon the eve of breaking out into open violence, nothing could &s;urpa&s;s the warm and cordial friend&s;hip which the&s;e gentlemen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, not only for me, but for every individual that bore a Briti&s;h name, or had any connexion with that i&s;land; profe&s;&s;ing, that they &s;till retained the greate&s;t regard for every thing in Bri|tain, but its admini&s;tration. I accepted of their very polite propo&s;al; after which, having received a letter from Mr. Kennedy, to be delivered to one of the militia captains, a Mr. N. Reeder, in the river Comewina, with orders to &s;end me farther up in a proper tent-boat; and having arranged matters in &s;uch a manner at home, that neither Colonel Fourgeoud nor the cock-roaches could injure me, I &s;hook hands with my Mulatta, and at &s;ix in the evening repaired once more to the water-&s;ide, e&s;|corted by my Engli&s;h and American friends, where, hav|ing drank a bowl of punch, we &s;eparated. I then departed for my &s;tation, they having hoi&s;ted the colours on board all their ve&s;&s;els in the road, and at the boat's going off &s;aluted me with three cheers, to my great &s;atisfaction, and the mortification of the gaping multitude by which we were &s;urrounded. We &s;oon rowed beyond the view of Paramaribo.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the fortre&s;s of New Am&s;terdam, we were obliged to &s;top for the return of the tide, to row up the river Comewina. In this interval, I was genteelly entertained with a &s;upper by the Society officers quar|tered there; but at twelve o'clock we got aboard, and
<PB N="219" REF="271">
having rowed all night, I breakfa&s;ted with Captain Macneyl, who was one of General Spork's captains in 1751; after which we once more &s;et out, and arrived at the plantation Charlottenburgh, where I delivered Mr. Kennedy's letter to Mr. Reeder, who promi&s;ed next morn|ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. So much incen&s;ed was I at the u&s;age I had met with at Paramaribo, and &s;o well plea&s;ed with the Engli&s;h &s;ailors, that I ordered the tars a dinner of twelve roa&s;ted ducks, and gave them thirty-&s;ix bottles of claret, being my whole &s;tock, be&s;ides a guinea. When the tide ebbed they took their leave, and rowed down to their ve&s;&s;els, as well plea&s;ed, and as drunk as wine or &s;trong &s;pirits could make them.</P>
<P>I now pur&s;ued my voyage upwards as far as the e&s;tate Monde&s;ir; afterwards, having viewed the ruins of the three e&s;tates, Zuzingheyd, Peru, and L'E&s;perance, which had been burnt when I commanded at Devil's Harwar, I arrived at Lepair. Here one of the over&s;eers gave me an account of his miraculous e&s;cape from the rebels, which I &s;hall relate in his own words.&mdash;"The rebels, Sir," &s;aid he, "had already &s;urrounded the dwelling-hou&s;e in which I was, before I knew of their being in the plantation, and were employed in &s;etting fire to the four corners of it, &s;o that to run out of doors was ru&s;h|ing on certain death. In this dilemma I fled to the garret, where I laid my&s;elf flat upon one of the beams, in hopes of their di&s;per&s;ing &s;oon, and that I might effect
<PB N="220" REF="272">
my e&s;cape before the building &s;hould be burnt down; but in this I was di&s;appointed, as they &s;till remained; and at the &s;ame time the flames encrea&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that the heat became in&s;upportable in the place where I was, and I had no other alternative left, than to be burnt to death, or to leap from a high garret window into the mid&s;t of my exa&s;perated enemies. This la&s;t mea&s;ure, how|ever, I re&s;olved upon, and had not only the good fortune to light unhurt upon my feet, but to e&s;cape without a wound, from among &s;o many men armed with &s;abres and bill-hooks. I flew to the river-&s;ide, into which I plunged headlong; however, not being able to &s;wim, I immediately &s;unk to the bottom; but (&s;aid he) I &s;till kept my full pre&s;ence of mind, and while they con|cluded me to be drowned, found means, by the help of the <HI>moco-moco</HI> and mangrove roots, to bring my&s;elf not only under cover of the impending verdure, but ju&s;t &s;o far above water with my lips as to continue in a &s;tate of re&s;piration till all was over. Having killed every other per&s;on, the rebels departed, and I was taken up by a boat from my very perilous &s;ituation."</P>
<P>On the 30th I arrived at Devil's Harwar, and the &s;uc|ceeding day rowed up the Cormoetibo Creek; where, having tied the boat to a tree which over&s;pread it with thick branches, we quietly lay down to &s;leep during the night; my&s;elf and Quaco in the boat upon the benches, and the negroes under the &s;eats, except tho&s;e whom I
<PB N="221" REF="273">
ordered alternately to keep watch, and awake me if they heard the lea&s;t ru&s;tling in the woods, forbidding them all ab&s;olutely to &s;peak or make any noi&s;e, le&s;t the rebels, who were hovering on both &s;ides of the Creek, might hear and &s;urprize us. As for my&s;elf, who was the only white per&s;on among&s;t them all, I was confident I &s;hould not, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, e&s;cape their fury. After the&s;e pre|cautions, we all lay down and &s;lept &s;oundly, from nine o'clock till about three in the morning, at which time Quaco and my&s;elf were both &s;uddenly thrown down from our benches, by the boat all at once heeling upon one &s;ide, while all the negroes leaped overboard into the water. I in&s;tantly cocked my pi&s;tol, and jumping up, a&s;ked aloud what was the matter? po&s;itively deter|mined to defend my&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity, rather than be taken alive by &s;o relentle&s;s an enemy. For the &s;pace of a few &s;econds I obtained no an&s;wer, when again the boat &s;uddenly rectifying it&s;elf (by the motion of which I was thrown off my feet) one of the &s;wimming negroes called out, "Ma&s;era, da wan &s;ea-cow;" and to my great happi|ne&s;s it proved to be no other than the manati, or &s;ea-cow, which is called in Cayenne the <HI>lamentyn.</HI> By the account of the negroes it had &s;lept under the boat, which, by the creature's awaking, had been lifted up and thrown upon one &s;ide, and again replaced when the manati made its e&s;cape from underneath it. I did not &s;o much as &s;ee the creature, nor indeed hardly had the negro, owing to the darkne&s;s of the night, which la&s;ted &s;ome hours
<PB N="222" REF="274">
after; but during that time we had no further inclina|tion to re&s;t. At la&s;t the &s;un's bright beams began to dart through the trees and gild the foliage; on which we ca&s;t off from our moorings, and continued rowing up Cormoetibo Creek (which was now very narrow) till near noon, when we di&s;covered a &s;moak, and at la&s;t came to the mouth of the Wana Creek, which runs into the Marawina, and which was the place of rendezvous, where however the troops were not yet arrived; and oppo&s;ite to which were encamped a few of the rangers, to guard the provi&s;ions that were waiting the arrival of Colonel Fourgeoud and his party from Craw|a&s;&s;ibo, and la&s;t from Patamaca.</P>
<P>One of the rangers having killed a tattu or armadillo, called in Surinam <HI>capa&s;ce,</HI> I &s;hall embrace this opportu|nity of de&s;cribing it.&mdash;This animal is with propriety &s;ometimes &s;tiled a hog-in-armour; its head and ears being much like tho&s;e of a roa&s;ting pig, and its whole body covered over with hard &s;hells like &s;hields, &s;liding in moveable rings, like tho&s;e of the <HI>quee-quee</HI> fi&s;h already mentioned, the one over the other, except on the &s;houlders and the rump, which are covered &s;omething like turtle, with one &s;olid ma&s;s of immoveable bone, called by &s;ome a cuira&s;s and a helmet. Of this crea|ture there are many &s;pecies in Guiana, the large&s;t being from the &s;nout to the tip of the tail above three feet in length, of a reddi&s;h colour, and marked all over with hexangular figures. Its eyes are &s;mall, the
<PB N="223" REF="275">
tail long and thick at the root, and tapering gradually like a carrot towards the point, and is covered over like the body with moveable rings. This animal has four &s;hort legs with four toes, armed with two claws on the fore-feet, and five on tho&s;e behind. The ar|madillo walks generally during the night, being &s;eldom &s;een through the day, and &s;leeps in burrows under ground, which it makes with great facility, and in which it &s;ticks &s;o fa&s;t that the &s;tronge&s;t man cannot draw it out, though he were to pull its tail with both hands. When attacked or terrified, it forms it&s;elf into a round ball like a hedge-hog, making its cuira&s;s and helmet meet together, in which are enclo&s;ed its head, feet, and whole body. This creature feeds on roots, in&s;ects, fruits, birds, &amp;c. and when dre&s;&s;ed appeared to me a tolerably good di&s;h, though in general by Europeans it is accounted no great delicacy; the Indians are, however, extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in this place, al&s;o take the opportunity of men|tioning the Guiana porcupine, which is frequently called here the <HI>adjora.</HI> This animal, which is from its muzzle to the root of the tail &s;ometimes three feet in length, is covered with hard prickles, the feet, the face, and part of its tail excepted. The&s;e prickles are about three inches long, yellow at the root, a dark che&s;nut colour in the middle, and white at the points; they are extremely &s;harp, highly poli&s;hed, and moveable, &s;erving for the creature's defence, which, when irritated, it dre&s;&s;es in
<PB N="224" REF="276">
array, and makes a formidable appearance before its ad|ver&s;ary; at other times the&s;e prickles lie flat on its back, &s;omething like the bri&s;tles of a hog. The head of the porcupine is of a roundi&s;h make, and joined to the body by a remarkably thick &s;hort neck; its eyes are large, bright, and placed under the ears, which are very &s;mall and round; it never bites. On each &s;ide of its no&s;e it has long whi&s;kers, very like the otter or the cat; its feet are &s;haped much like tho&s;e of a monkey, which a&s;&s;i&s;t it in climbing trees to &s;eek for its food, in which its long tapering tail is al&s;o very &s;erviceable, which, like a fifth limb, it twi&s;ts about the branches, and which near the extremity is covered over with hair like the face, the under part near the tip only excepted, which is per|fectly callous and black, as are al&s;o the in&s;ide of all its feet. The hedge-hog of this country is, I think, little different from that of the old continent, being about eight or ten inches in length, covered over with pale yellow prickles, but with hair on the face and under the belly, which is rather &s;ofter and longer than in the hedge|hog of Europe. It has dark brown &s;pots like eye-brows over its eyes, and no ears but auditory holes, and five toes with bended claws on each foot; its tail is very &s;hort, and its defence con&s;i&s;ts in forming it&s;elf into a round ball in the manner of the armadillo. Its food con&s;i&s;ts of fruit, roots, vegetables, in&s;ects, &amp;c. and its fle&s;h is not di&s;|e&s;teemed by the Indians or natives of the country.</P>

my&s;elf with &s;wimming, and paddling up the mouth of the deep Wana Creek, with a canoe; during which time a Mr. Ruback, one of our officers who was with me, ob|&s;erved (in the top of a mangrove-tree) a battle between a &s;nake and a frog; and for an additional proof that frogs are to be found in trees, I refer the reader to the Monthly Review for March 1785, page 199, where, in the Abb&eacute; Spallanzani's Di&s;&s;ertation upon Frogs, the Tree Frog is particularly mentioned. But finding this animal among&s;t the branches did not &s;o much excite my &s;urprize, as the conte&s;t between a &s;nake and a frog, which I &s;hall di&s;|tinctly relate, and in which the poor frog lo&s;t the battle. Indeed when I fir&s;t perceived him, his head and &s;houlders were already in the jaws of the &s;nake, which la&s;t appeared to me about the &s;ize of a large kitchen poker, and had its tail twi&s;ted round a tough limb of the mangrove; while the frog, who appeared to be the &s;ize of a man's fi&s;t, had laid hold of a twig with the claws of its hinder legs, as with hands. In this po&s;i|tion were they contending, the one for life, the other for his dinner, forming one &s;traight line between the two branches, and thus I beheld them for &s;ome time, apparently &s;tationary, and without a &s;truggle. Still I was not without hope, that the poor frog might extricate him&s;elf by his exertions; but the rever&s;e was the ca&s;e, for the jaws of the &s;nake gradually relaxing, and by their ela&s;ticity forming an incredible orifice, the body and fore-legs of the frog by little and little di&s;appeared,
<PB N="226" REF="279">
till finally nothing more was &s;een than the hinder feet and claws, which were at la&s;t di&s;engaged from the twig, and the poor creature was &s;wallowed whole by &s;uction down the throat of his formidable adver&s;ary, whence he was drawn &s;ome inches farther down the alimentary canal, and at la&s;t &s;tuck, forming a knob or knot at lea&s;t &s;ix times as thick as the &s;nake, who&s;e jaws and throat immediately contracted and re-a&s;&s;umed their for|mer natural &s;hape. The &s;nake being out of our reach, we could not kill him, as we wi&s;hed to do, to take a further examination. Thus we left him, continuing in the &s;ame attitude without moving, and twi&s;ted round the branch.</P>
<P>On the third of November, one party of the troops be|ing arrived, and encamped on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the Cormoetibo Creek, about one mile above the mouth of the Wana Creek, I went with a couple of rangers to pay them a vi&s;it; when Major Rughcop, the commanding of|ficer, informed me that Colonel Fourgeoud had marched la&s;t from Patamaca in two columns, of which he led the one, while the other was hourly expected; and that the re&s;t of the regiment was divided between the rivers Cot|tica, Perica, and Comewina, excepting tho&s;e that were &s;ick in the ho&s;pital at Paramaribo. I was now in excel|lent health and good &s;pirits; and in the hopes of being reconciled to Fourgeoud by this voluntary proof of my zeal for the &s;ervice, I returned to the rangers' camp to wait his arrival. I was indeed well acquainted with his

<PB N="227" REF="281">
irreconcileable temper, and at the &s;ame time con&s;cious of my own wild and ungovernable di&s;po&s;ition, when I thought my&s;elf ill treated; but &s;oon forgot trifling inju|ries, and was now determined, by my active and affable behaviour, to make him my friend if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>At length the wi&s;hed-for hour arrived; and being ap|prized of Colonel Fourgeoud's approach, I went half a mile from the camp to meet him, acquainting him that I was come <HI>pour participer de la gloire,</HI> and to &s;erve un|der his immediate command, which he having an&s;wered with a bow, I returned it, and we marched together to the rangers' camp.</P>
<P>The occurrences in this march were the troops tak|ing from the enemy three villages, particularly one called the <HI>Rice Country,</HI> on account of the great quan|tity of rice which was found there, &s;ome ripe and &s;ome in full blo&s;&s;om, which we totally de&s;troyed, after put|ting the rebels to flight. The&s;e were commanded by one <HI>Bonny,</HI> a relentle&s;s Mulatto, who was born in the fo|re&s;t, and was quite unconnected with Baron's party, which had lately been driven from Boucou. We further learn|ed that they had found &s;even <HI>human &s;kulls</HI> &s;tuck upon &s;takes, under which lay mouldering the bodies above ground, and part of the garments, (as may be &s;een in the annexed plate) and which proved them to be the remains of the unfortunate Lieutenant <HI>Lepper,</HI> with &s;ix of his unhappy men, mo&s;t of whom being taken alive, had one by one been &s;tripped naked by the rebel negroes at the arrival in their village, and (for the <HI>recreation</HI> of their wives and children) by Bonny's orders flogged to death.

This information we got from a rebel woman, who had been made a pri&s;oner by Fourgeoud on his march through the above village or <HI>rice condre,</HI> and whom we treated with every kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>This inhuman conduct in Bonny was directly oppo&s;ite to that of Baron, who, notwith&s;tanding all his threats and menaces, it was well known had &s;ent back to Para|maribo different &s;oldiers, whom he might have killed. He even a&s;&s;i&s;ted in concealing them from his enraged accomplices, and furni&s;hed them with provi&s;ions, per|fectly &s;en&s;ible that they were not the cau&s;e of the di&s;|turbance. But not a ranger, as I have &s;aid before, that had the misfortune to fall into his hands could e&s;cape his ungovernable fury.</P>
<P>On further conver&s;ation, we found that the whole party, being nearly &s;tarved, had conjunctly called out for bread, as it was known that there was plenty in the boxes, but that it had been kept back three days, and rice &s;erved out in its &s;tead. To &s;uppre&s;s this kind of mutiny, the offi|cers had ru&s;hed in among&s;t the men with cocked pi&s;tols and drawn &s;words, and indi&s;criminately laying hold of the fir&s;t in their way, had unluckily &s;eized a poor man named <HI>Shmidt,</HI> whom, notwith&s;tanding all the others averred to be innocent, they had, for an example to the re&s;t, ba&s;to|naded between two corporals, till the blood gu&s;hed out of his mouth like a fountain;&mdash;and thus ended the re|volt. One of the conductors, named <HI>Mangol,</HI> di&s;daining at all to &s;erve under Colonel Fourgeoud's command, had left him without a&s;king his con&s;ent, after which he
<PB N="229" REF="283">
for&s;ook the &s;ervice entirely. The&s;e were the particulars of the march in both columns, from Crawa&s;&s;ibo in Come|wina to the Wana Creek.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was now about noon re&s;ting in my hammock very contentedly, I was acco&s;ted by my friend Lieutenant <HI>Campbell,</HI> who acquainted me, with tears in his eyes, that the evening before Colonel Fourgeoud had given to the officers of the Surinam Society, not only of that brave and gallant corps the <HI>Scots brigade</HI> in the Dutch &s;ervice, but of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> in general, the mo&s;t unmerited cha|racter that could be invented. I immediately &s;tarted up; and having got Campbell's information confirmed, went to Fourgeoud, and a&s;ked him in public the cau&s;e of this unmanly &s;lander. He replied with a &s;tare, that <HI>his</HI> ob&s;ervations only regarded my petticoat-trow&s;ers, which I wore for coolne&s;s and conveniency, as many Bri|ti&s;h &s;eamen do, and which he had never &s;een on the mountains of Switzerland. But as to the re&s;t of what was &s;aid re&s;pecting us, he laid it totally to the charge of Mr. <HI>Stoelman,</HI> captain of the Cottica militia, who was ab|&s;ent. Thus I could only an&s;wer by denouncing, in the &s;e|vere&s;t terms, vengeance upon this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of our reputa|tion; and after promi&s;ing to transform my &s;hort trow&s;ers into long ones, we coolly &s;eparated.</P>
<P>An hour however after this, I received a &s;udden order to cro&s;s the Cormoetibo River, and be henceforth under the command of Major <HI>Rughcop,</HI> who was with his party
<PB N="230" REF="284">
or column at this time encamped on the &s;outh-&s;ide at the mouth of Wana Creek.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Force is indeed the ruling principle in military affairs,"</Q>
&s;ays a certain author; and, upon the whole, could the ingenious advice given to a commander in chief, as publi&s;hed in a late pamphlet, have been read by Colonel Fourgeoud, I mu&s;t have ima|gined he had &s;tudied it, &s;entence after &s;entence, &s;ince no|thing could better corre&s;pond with his general character.</P>
<P>Being arrived in Major Rughcop's camp, and having got a couple of negroes to &s;erve me, the next mea&s;ure was to build a hut, or, more properly &s;peaking, a &s;hed over my hammock, to keep me free from the rain and the &s;un, which was done within the &s;pace of one hour. As the&s;e huts are of very material and of general u&s;e in tropical marches and campaigns, where no tents can be pitched, and where (as I have &s;een, &s;o many thou&s;ands of the&s;e temporary erections) I will de&s;cribe the manner in which they are con&s;tructed, being not only extremely curious, but very u&s;eful on different occa&s;ions&mdash;curious, becau&s;e neither hammers nor nails, nor indeed any kind of carpenter's tools are required; a &s;trong cutla&s;s or bill-hook being all that is wanted,&mdash;and u&s;eful, as they are in&s;tantly rai&s;ed, and form not only la&s;ting, but the mo&s;t delightful and convenient habitations, with even two &s;to|ries, one above the other, if required.&mdash;For the&s;e erections not more than two articles are wanting; the fir&s;t the manicole, by the French called <HI>latanie,</HI> and here <HI>para&s;alla,</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="285">
or the pine-tree; and the &s;econd the nebees, called by the French <HI>liannes,</HI> by the Spaniards <HI>bejucos,</HI> and in Surinam <HI>tay-tay.</HI></P>
<P>The manicole-tree, which is of the palm-tree &s;pecies, is mo&s;tly found in mar&s;hy places, and is always a proof of a rich and luxurious &s;oil. It is about the thickne&s;s of a man's thigh, very &s;trait, and grows to the height of from thirty to fifty feet from the ground: the trunk, which is jointed at the di&s;tance of two or three feet, is of a light-brown colour, hard externally for the thick|ne&s;s of half an inch, but pithy, like the Engli&s;h elder, and good for nothing within, except near the top, where the wood becomes green, and inclo&s;es a delicious kind of white fruit, called cabbage, and which, being peculiar to all the palm-trees, I &s;hall on another occa&s;ion amply de&s;cribe. On the top of all this the manicole-tree &s;preads in beautiful green boughs, with leaves hanging &s;trait downwards like &s;ilk ribbons, which form a kind of umbrella. The manner of u&s;ing it for building huts or cottages, is by cutting the trunk in pieces of as many feet long as you wi&s;h to have the partition high; for in&s;tance, &s;even feet, which pieces are next &s;plit into &s;mall boards, the breadth of a man's hand, and dive&s;ted of their pithy &s;ub&s;tance, and then they are &s;it for immedi|ate u&s;e. Having cut and prepared as many of the&s;e laths as you wanted to &s;urround the dwelling, nothing remains but to la&s;h them in a perpendicular po&s;ition and clo&s;e to each other to two cro&s;s bars of the &s;ame tree fixed to
<PB N="232" REF="286">
the corner po&s;ts, and the whole is cut and &s;haped with the bill-hook alone, and tied together by the nebees or <HI>tay-tay,</HI> which I think have derived their name from our verb <HI>to tie,</HI> &s;ince the Engli&s;h had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the co|lony. The nebees are a kind of ligneous ropes of all &s;izes, both as to length and thickne&s;s, that grow in the woods, and climb up along the trees in all directions: they are &s;o plentiful and wonderfully di&s;per&s;ed, that, like the ligneous cordage of the mangrove, they make the fore&s;t appear like a large fleet at anchor, killing many of the trees by mere compre&s;&s;ion, and entwining them|&s;elves with each other to the thickne&s;s of a &s;hip's cable, without any kind of foliage, which gives them &s;ome|times a wonderful appearance, particularly when a&s;cend|ing lofty trunks in a &s;piral manner to the top, from which they next hang down to the earth, take root, and re-a&s;cend. Sometimes the thin nebees are &s;o clo&s;ely in|terwoven, that they have the appearance of fi&s;hing nets, and game cannot get through them. The&s;e nebees are exceedingly tough, and may be u&s;ed for mooring large ve&s;&s;els to the &s;hore. Having only to add, that &s;ome of the &s;pecies are poi&s;onous, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are flat, grooved, or angular, I &s;hall proceed to the roofing of the cottage.</P>
<P>This is done by the green boughs or branches of the &s;ame manicole-tree that made the walls, and in the fol|lowing manner: each bough, which I can compare to nothing &s;o well as to the &s;hape of a feather, and which
<PB N="233" REF="287">
is as large as a man, mu&s;t be &s;plit from the top to the bottom in two equal parts, as you would &s;plit a pen, when a number of the&s;e half boughs are tied together by their own verdure, and form a bunch; you next take the&s;e bunches, and tie them with nebees one above an|other upon the roof of your cottage, as thick as you plea&s;e, and in &s;uch a manner that the verdure, which looks like the mane of a hor&s;e, hangs downwards. This covering, which at fir&s;t is green, but &s;oon takes the co|lour of the Engli&s;h reed-thatching, is very beautiful, la&s;ting and clo&s;e, and fini&s;hes your hou&s;e, as I have &s;aid, without the help of a hammer or nails; the doors and windows, tables, &s;eats, &amp;c. are made in the &s;ame manner, &s;o are the inclo&s;ures for gardens, or other places for keeping cattle; and by this conveniency it is that the rebel negroes never want good hou&s;es, which, if burnt to a&s;hes one day, are again perfectly rebuilt the next, though they never rebuild them exactly in the places where they have once been di&s;covered by Europeans. The Indians, in&s;tead of the manicoles, generally cover their wigwams with <HI>tas</HI> or with <HI>trooly,</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;peak on another occa&s;ion. I ought not to forget, that the &s;eeds of the&s;e trees are contained in a &s;patha, near the top, of thirty or forty knotty fibres, forming a &s;pecies of broom, for which they are u&s;ed throughout the colony; thus, while the manicole &s;upplies the materials for a hou&s;e, it affords al&s;o the means of keeping it clean. This tree produces al&s;o the cabbage, which, as I have
<PB N="234" REF="288">
&s;aid, is found in all the other palm-trees, &amp;c. The hut that I now lay under was not built in the convenient man|ner above de&s;cribed; it was not requi&s;ite, for the &s;hort time we generally continued in one place: my habitation con&s;i&s;ted only of a roof or cover without any walls. The manner of erecting the&s;e little &s;heds, which every private &s;oldier builds for him&s;elf, is &s;imply by planting four forked poles in the ground, at &s;uch a di&s;tance that a hammock can conveniently hang between them; next, to re&s;t two &s;hort poles, &s;trong enough to &s;upport the weight of the body in the above forks, the one at the head and the other at the feet, to which are fa&s;tened the clews of the hammock. On the other extremities of the&s;e are laid two long &s;ticks, and on them again two &s;hort ones, and thus alternately two long and two &s;hort, all which dimi|ni&s;h by degrees. When the whole is fini&s;hed, the top mu&s;t be covered with branches from the manicole, exactly as they grow, without either &s;plitting or tying them, and as thick as the &s;ea&s;on may require.</P>
<P>When this temporary fabric is completely fini&s;hed, it will not only keep dry both the inhabitants and their boxes, but (by the help of the nebees) fuzees, &s;words, pi&s;|tols, &amp;c. may be &s;u&s;pended from the rafters. As I have been de&s;cribing the manicole, I am induced al&s;o to men|tion the cocoa-nut tree, as I think it re&s;embles that more than any of the palm &s;pecies. This tree, which is &s;o much celebrated, as affording to man food, clothing, &s;helter, &amp;c. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not, in my opinion, all tho&s;e qualities,
<PB N="235" REF="289">
but &s;till is well worthy of notice. It grows like the for|mer, in a tall jointed trunk, &s;ometimes from &s;ixty to above eighty feet high, and is thick in proportion, but &s;eldom perpendicularly &s;traight: its bark is of a grey colour; the wood is hard without, but pithy within, like the elder in Great Britain; its branches are larger, and of a deeper green, than tho&s;e of the manicole-tree, but are equally divided, with pinnated leaves on both &s;ides, which in the other I compared to green ribbons; but they neither hang &s;o &s;traight downwards, nor are the branches regu|larly arched, which gives them the appearance of large feathers, and they &s;pring up at the top, in proportion as they fade and go off at the bottom: the cocoa-tree al&s;o produces a cabbage at its &s;ummit, but is too valuable to be cut down for the &s;ake of a prize &s;o inadequate to the lo&s;s of its other produce. It bears the nuts when &s;ix or eight years old, after which period it is never &s;een with|out them; they grow u&s;ually &s;ix or eight on one &s;talk, which diverges from the heart of the tree; they are the &s;ize of a man's head, but more conical. The nut, it is well known, when dive&s;ted of its hu&s;k, is exceedingly hard, and requires a hammer to break it, or to be &s;awed through the middle to procure the nouri&s;hment it affords; when young, this con&s;i&s;ts of a white liquid, which I can com|pare to nothing better than to milk and water mixed with &s;ugar, and which is an exceedingly cool and agreeable beverage; but at a riper period this is formed into a cri&s;p kernel, which adheres clo&s;e to the in&s;ide of the &s;hell
<PB N="236" REF="290">
for about half an inch thick, while it remains perfectly hollow within. This kernel, which has a fine flavour, and ta&s;tes like the liquid, is good eating, as mo&s;t of my readers have probably experienced.</P>
<P>In the plate annexed, <HI>A,</HI> is the manicole-tree; <HI>B,</HI> the trunk &s;plit into laths; <HI>C,</HI> the nebees to tie them together; <HI>D,</HI> the leaf &s;plit from the top downwards; and <HI>E,</HI> the &s;ame tied into bunches; <HI>F,</HI> is the cocoa-nut tree; <HI>G,</HI> the figure of one of its branches; <HI>H,</HI> the cocoa-nut in the green hu&s;k; and <HI>I,</HI> the &s;ame dive&s;ted of that outer &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>But to proceed with my narrative.&mdash;While we conti|nued in this &s;tation, one morning, being returned from a patrole, with twenty marines and twenty rangers, and &s;itting round a &s;pecies of table to take &s;ome dinner with the other officers, I was rudely in&s;ulted by a Captain <HI>Meyland,</HI> of the Society troops, who, as I &s;aid, with Lieu|tenant Fredericy, had taken Boucou, and who was Co|lonel Fourgeoud's countryman and friend. The affront con&s;i&s;ted in Meyland's handing round to each a drop of claret, he having indeed but one bottle left, and, in an impertinent manner, excepting me alone, although I held the gla&s;s in my hand to receive it. Ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pecting this in&s;ult to originate from my commander in chief, rather than appear to &s;eek a quarrel, I endeavoured to make an apology, telling him, I had inadvertently erred in hold|ing out my gla&s;s, not imagining I was to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other officers; a&s;&s;uring him it was not for the value of his wine, which I politely relinqui&s;hed to my

next neighbour; but this conce&s;&s;ion had no other effect than to increa&s;e the wrath of my fierce adver&s;ary, who, apparently mi&s;taking it for pu&s;illanimity, became over|bearing and &s;currilous, in which he was &s;econded by all the other Swi&s;s and Germans without exception. I &s;aid no more, and having tore away a wing of a boiled bird called <HI>powe&s;e,</HI> that &s;tood before me (which bird had been &s;hot by one of the rangers) I devoured it with little ceremony, and left the table, with a determination to &s;upport my character or die. Thus re&s;olved, I fir&s;t went to the hut of a &s;ick &s;oldier, who&s;e &s;abre I borrowed (my own being broken) on pretence of going out to cut a few &s;ticks; after this I went in que&s;t of Mr. Meyland, and found him contentedly &s;moking his pipe by the wa|ter-&s;ide, looking at one of his friends who was angling. Having tapped him on the &s;houlder, I ha&s;tily told him, be|fore the other, that now if he did not fight me that in&s;tant like a gentleman, I was determined to take revenge ano|ther way, with the flat of my &s;abre, where he &s;tood. He at fir&s;t declared that he had only meant a joke, and &s;eem|ed for peace; but perceiving that I per&s;i&s;ted, he with great <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> knocked the tobacco-a&s;hes from his pipe again&s;t the heel of his &s;hoe; then having brought <HI>his</HI> &s;abre, we walked together without &s;econds about half a mile into the wood: here I &s;topt the captain &s;hort, and drawing my weapon, now de&s;ired him to &s;tand on his defence; this he did, but at the &s;ame time ob&s;erv|ed, that as the point of his &s;word was broken off, we were unequally armed; and &s;o indeed we were, <HI>his</HI> being
<PB N="238" REF="293">
&s;till near one foot longer than my own; therefore call|ing to him that <HI>&s;abres</HI> were not made to thru&s;t, but to cut with, I offered to make an exchange; but he refu&s;ing, I dropped mine on the ground, and eagerly with both hands endeavoured to wre&s;t his from him, till (as I had hold of it by the blade) I &s;aw the blood trickle down all my fingers, and I was obliged to let go. I now gra&s;ped my own &s;abre, with which I &s;truck at him many times, but without the lea&s;t effect, as he parried every blow with the utmo&s;t facility; at la&s;t, with all his force, he made a cut at my head, which, being con&s;cious I could not ward off by my &s;kill, I bowed under it, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;triking &s;ideways for his throat, had the good fortune to make a ga&s;h in the thick part of his right arm at lea&s;t &s;ix inches long, the two lips of which appeared through his blue jacket, and in con&s;equence of which his right-hand came down dangling by his &s;ide. I had, however, not e&s;caped entirely unhurt, for his &s;abre, hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed through my hat without touching my &s;cull, had glanced to my right &s;houlder, and cut it about one inch deep. At this time I in&s;i&s;ted on his a&s;king my par|don, or on &s;iring both our pi&s;tols left-handed; but he cho&s;e the fir&s;t, which ended the battle. I now reminded him that &s;uch Swi&s;s jokes were always too &s;erious to Engli&s;hmen; when we &s;hook hands, and I conducted him, covered with blood, to the &s;urgeon of his own corps, who having &s;ewed up the wound, he went to his hammock, and for the &s;pace of &s;everal weeks per|formed no duty. Thus was I reconciled to Captain
<PB N="239" REF="294">
Meyland; and what gave me the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction, was his acknowledging the affront was offered, as finding it would be agreeable to Fourgeoud to have me mortified; and indeed ever after this acknowledgment we lived in the utmo&s;t intimacy. Peace, however, was not yet de|creed to be my lot, for that very afternoon I found my|&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of challenging two other officers, who had e&s;pou&s;ed Meyland's quarrel again&s;t me at dinner; but in this I had the &s;atisfaction of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing my character without violence or blood&s;hed, both of the gentlemen acknowledged their error; and I became at once the favourite of the camp.</P>
<P>On the 9th of November both columns met, and en|camped together on the north &s;ide of the Wana Creek, near its mouth, where it runs into the Cormoetibo, plac|ing advanced guards at both creeks, at one mile di&s;tance from it; and this very evening I took the opportunity of acquainting Colonel Fourgeoud, that I had nearly cut off the head of his beloved countryman in a duel (well knowing he mu&s;t be informed of it by others); which tre&s;pa&s;s he was not only plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to pardon, but to tell me with a &s;mile that I was a <HI>brave gar&ccedil;on,</HI> but in tho&s;e &s;miles I put no more tru&s;t than I would in the tears of a crocodile.</P>
<P>My doubts of his friend&s;hip were &s;oon confirmed, &s;ince my only true friend, Campbell, going down &s;ick to Devil's Harwar, he would not &s;o much as allow the boat or pon|kee to wait till I had fini&s;hed a letter, directed to Joanna,
<PB N="240" REF="295">
for &s;ome clean linen; however, a ranger (of which corps I by this time was become a remarkable favourite) found means to enable me to overtake this poor young man in a corialla or &s;mall canoe, compo&s;ed of one &s;ingle piece of timber; when, &s;haking hands with Campbell, we &s;epa|rated with tears, and I never &s;aw him more, for he died in a few days after. Colonel Fourgeoud now being de|termined to &s;cour the north banks of the Cormoetibo, we broke up in two columns, viz. his own fir&s;t, and that of Major Rughcop, to which la&s;t I &s;till belonged, follow|ing; we left behind a &s;trong guard, with the provi&s;ions for the &s;ick.

every thing was in the mo&s;t unaccountable hurry and confu&s;ion. In this way, however, we proceeded, keeping our cour&s;e toward the mouth of the Cormoetibo Creek, each officer provided with a pocket compa&s;s, by which we were to &s;teer, like &s;ailors, through a dark wood, where nothing is to be &s;een but the heavens, as at &s;ea nothing appears but clouds and water: thus tho&s;e who were ac|quainted with navigation were the be&s;t qualified for marching, and ran the lea&s;t hazard of lo&s;ing them&s;elves in a black unbounded fore&s;t. But tho&s;e wretches who mo&s;t de&s;ervedly attracted my pity, were the mi&s;erable ne|gro &s;laves, who were bending under their loads; who&s;e heads, on which they carry all burthens, bore the bald marks of their &s;ervitude;&mdash;they were driven forward like oxen, and condemned to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on half allowance, while they performed double drudgery. In &s;hort, to increa&s;e our misfortune, though in the dry &s;ea&s;on, the rains began to pour down from the heavens like a torrent, continuing all night: during this deluge (according to Colonel Four|geoud's order) we were all ordered to encamp without huts or other covering of any kind, &s;linging our ham|mocks between two trees, under which, upon two &s;mall forked &s;ticks, were placed our fire-arms, as the only me|thod of keeping the priming-powder dry in the pan; above this piece of architecture did I hang, like Mahomet betwixt the two load&s;tones, with thy &s;abre and pi&s;tols in my bo&s;om, and, in &s;pite of wind and weather, fell mo&s;t profoundly a&s;leep.</P>

<PB N="243" REF="298">
awaked by the &s;ound of Up! up! up! when the rain &s;till continuing, the half of the officers and men were &s;ick, and I ro&s;e from my hammock &s;oaked as in a wa&s;h-tub; having &s;ecured the lock of my firelock, in imitation of the rangers, with a piece of the bark of a palm-tree, and &s;wallowing a dram, with a piece of dry ru&s;k bi&s;cuit, for my breakfa&s;t, we again marched on. But I ought not to forget mentioning the negroes, who had the whole night &s;lept in the water on the ground, and yet were in better health than any of the Europeans. Had we now been at|tacked by the enemy, we mu&s;t inevitably have been all cut to pieces, being di&s;abled from re&s;i&s;ting with our fire|arms, in which not only the priming but even many of the cartridges were completely wet; this might have been prevented by having ca&s;ed and waxed down our arms, as is practi&s;ed by the buccaneers of America; but the&s;e were trifles not to be thought of: one thing, how|ever, now happened which threatened to be no trifle, and that was, that the provi&s;ions were gone, and tho&s;e we expected to meet us in the creek not arrived, having by &s;ome mi&s;take been neglected. By this accident we were now reduced, officers and men without exception, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on one ru&s;k bi&s;cuit and water for our allowance for twenty-four hours, to keep us from &s;tarving <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ru&s;k bi&s;cuit is made of a coar&s;e rye loaf, cut in two, and baked as hard as a &s;tone; I often broke it with my fu|zee, and was glad to eat it, though mould|ered, and impregnated with worms, &s;piders, gravel, and even broken bottles.</NOTE>: while it is to be remarked, that Mon&s;ieur Laurant, our hero's

French valet-de-chambre, who had charge of the provi|&s;ion, was blown down to Baram's point, and another time &s;unk with all the provi&s;ions; which produced the imper|tinent remark from &s;ome of the &s;oldiers, that the devil had mi&s;taken him for his ma&s;ter. In the mid&s;t how|ever of this di&s;tre&s;s, we were again pre&s;ented by one of the rangers with a large bird, called here <HI>boo&s;&s;y-calcoo,</HI> being a &s;pecies of wild turkey; of this fortunate acqui|&s;ition it was re&s;olved in the evening to make broth, each throwing a piece of his ru&s;k bi&s;cuit into the kettle, and (&s;tanding round the fire) beginning to ladle away as &s;oon as the broth began to boil, which had another virtue, viz. notwith&s;tanding its being put over at &s;ix o'clock in the evening, at twelve o'clock at midnight the kettle was ju&s;t as full as the fir&s;t moment we had begun &s;upper, though the broth was rather weaker I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, the heavy rain having da&s;hed into it without in|termi&s;&s;ion. During this &s;evere &s;torm we were as de&s;ti|tute of huts as the night before, but I availed my&s;elf once more of my Engli&s;h petticoat trow&s;ers, which, loo&s;ening from my middle, I hung about my &s;houlders, and con|tinuing to turn round before the fire (like a fowl roa&s;ting on a &s;tring) I pa&s;&s;ed the hours with rather more com|fort than my mi&s;erable coughing companions. All I can &s;ay of the bird above mentioned is, that I thought it differed little from the common turkeys, which here frequently weigh above twenty pounds.</P>
<P>The large&s;t bird in Guiana is there called <HI>tuyew,</HI> and by
<PB N="245" REF="300">
others <HI>emu.</HI> It is a middle &s;pecies between the o&s;trich and the ca&s;&s;owary, as I was told, for I never &s;aw one in the country: it is &s;aid to be about &s;ix feet high, from the top of the head to the ground; its head is &s;mall, its bill flat, the neck and limbs long, the body round, without a tail, and of a whiti&s;h grey colour; its thighs are remark|ably thick and &s;trong, and it has three toes on each foot, while the o&s;trich has but two. This bird, it is &s;aid, can|not fly at all, but runs very &s;wiftly; and, like the o&s;trich, a&s;&s;i&s;ts its motion with its wings: it is mo&s;tly found near the upper parts of the rivers Marawina and Seramica. When &s;peaking about birds, notwith&s;tanding few of them <HI>&s;ing</HI> here with any degree of melody, for which the beauty of their plumage is thought by &s;ome to com|pen&s;ate; I was, during this march, &s;o much charmed with two in particular, that I was induced to put their &s;weet notes to mu&s;ic. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t

The&s;e notes they &s;ung &s;o true, &s;o &s;oft, and to &s;uch proper time, that in any other place I &s;hould have been inclined to believe they were the performance of a human arti&s;t upon his flute. As I never &s;aw either of tho&s;e birds but imperfectly and at a di&s;tance, I can &s;ay nothing more concerning them, than that they are frequently heard in mar&s;hy &s;ituations.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="301">On the &s;ucceeding morning we marched again through very heavy rains, which by this time had &s;welled the water &s;o high in the woods that it reached above our knees, and prevented us from cro&s;&s;ing a &s;mall creek in our way, without the help of a temporary bridge.</P>
<P>I prevailed therefore on the rangers, with the help of a few &s;laves, to erect one, which they did in the &s;pace of forty minutes, by cutting down a &s;traight tree, which fell directly acro&s;s the creek, to this they al&s;o made a kind of railing; but &s;till with this our commander Rughcop, who&s;e temper was &s;oured by mi&s;ery, and who&s;e con&s;titu|tion was already broken by hard&s;hips, was not plea&s;ed. He paid the rangers for their pains with oaths and re|proaches, who, with a &s;mile of contempt, left him &s;wear|ing, and cro&s;&s;ed the creek, &s;ome by &s;wimming, and others by climbing up a tree who&s;e branches hung over it, from which they dropped down on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; in this I followed their example: and here we &s;topped till the arrival of the poor trembling and debilitated Major Rughcop, with two-thirds of his troops as &s;ick as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;till continued in perfect health, but I was much &s;tung by different in&s;ects, and torn by a thou&s;and thorns or <HI>maccaws,</HI> particularly one &s;pecies, which are &s;trong black prickles of &s;everal inches long, that break &s;hort in the wound; they project like the back of a porcupine, on a kind of low or dwarf palm-tree, called the <HI>cocareeta,</HI> who&s;e large branches diverge from the earth like the fire of a fu&s;ee from a bomb. Another inconvenience to
<PB N="247" REF="302">
be met with throughout all the low and mar&s;hy places in the fore&s;t, is a kind of roots called <HI>matakee,</HI> and more vulgarly trumpets, on account of the form, re&s;embling the windings of that in&s;trument, which ri&s;e above ground like nebees, three or four feet high, continuing thus to an almo&s;t endle&s;s length, and &s;o thick that, like our brambles, no dog can get through them; over the&s;e <HI>matakees</HI> it is extremely difficult to walk, as they every moment catch hold of the feet, and frequently trip up the body, unle&s;s at every foot&s;tep care is taken to &s;tep clear over them, which for &s;hort-limbed men is an ab|&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility. With this inconvenience we were troubled throughout the whole march; but we had no opportunity of falling in with any kind of good roots, ve|getables, or fruits for food, except a few <HI>maripas,</HI> which are a &s;pecies of nuts that grow on a tall palm-tree, and are very much like the <HI>aweyza</HI> that I have already de&s;cribed, only larger, and le&s;s of an orange colour, the &s;tone and kernel being exactly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>We marched again with better weather, and arrived before noon at Jeru&s;alem, near the mouth of Cormoetibo Creek, where I had formerly halted during my crui&s;e. Here Colonel Fourgeoud, with his drooping &s;oldiers, was arrived ju&s;t before us; and here we made our appear|ance, in &s;uch a &s;hocking &s;ituation as will &s;carcely admit of de&s;cription. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the whole little army was exhau&s;ted by famine and fatigue, a very &s;mall number excepted; while &s;everal, unable to walk at
<PB N="248" REF="303">
all, had been carried upon poles by negro &s;laves in their hammocks: and during all this time we had di&s;covered nothing. One thing is to be con&s;idered, that while the old gentleman him&s;elf went through all the above|men|tioned hard&s;hips, (to which he &s;eemed as invulnerable as a machine of iron or bra&s;s) we had the le&s;s rea&s;on to complain of bad u&s;age. In &s;hort, having as u&s;ual plunged in the river, to wa&s;h off the mire and blood occa&s;ioned by the &s;cratches, and having taken a refre&s;hing &s;wim, I looked round for my negroes to erect a comfortable hut; but in this I was di&s;appointed, as they were employed by Mr. Rughcop to build his kitchen, although he had as yet nothing to dre&s;s in it. This piece of unpolitene&s;s I for once overlooked; and the rangers having made me a nice bed of manicole-branches on the ground, (there being no trees in the place to &s;ling a hammock) and having lighted a blazing fire by the &s;ide of it, I lay quietly down next to them on my green mattre&s;s, where, in a clear moon&s;hine night and no rain, I fell &s;ound a&s;leep. But about two hours before day-break I awaked, when the fire was out, the moon was down, and I almo&s;t dead with the cold dew and the damp that exhaled from the earth, being &s;o &s;tiff and benumbed that I had &s;carcely &s;trength to crawl on hands and feet, and awake one of my &s;able companions; he, however, having kindled a new fire, I recruited &s;o as at &s;ix o'clock to be able to ri&s;e, but with &s;uch excruciating pain in one of my &s;ides that I could not avoid groaning aloud; but to prevent Fourgeoud
<PB N="249" REF="304">
and the others from hearing, I hid my&s;elf in the &s;kirts of the wood; the pain however &s;till augmenting, I &s;oon was prevented from breathing without the greate&s;t difficulty, and at la&s;t fell down behind the rotten trunk of an old cab|bage-tree. In this &s;ituation I was di&s;covered by one of the negro &s;laves who was going to cut rafters, and who, &s;uppo&s;ing me dead, ran in&s;tantly back, and alarmed the whole camp. I was taken up and carried in a hammock, by the care of a Captain Medler, under proper cover, and one of the Society &s;urgeons in&s;tantly &s;ent for to attend me. By this time I was &s;urrounded by &s;pectators, and the pain in my &s;ide became &s;o acute, that, like one in the hydro|phobia, I tore my &s;hirt with my teeth, and bit whatever chanced to come near me; till being rubbed by a warm hand on my &s;ide with a kind of ointment, the complaint &s;uddenly vani&s;hed like a dream, and I felt my&s;elf com|pletely recovered.</P>
<P>To prevent a relap&s;e, however, the fir&s;t u&s;e that I made of my &s;trength was to cut a cudgel, with which I &s;wore to murder the Berbice ruffian, Geu&s;ary, who had the management of the &s;laves, if he did not in&s;tantaneou&s;ly employ them to build for me a comfortable hut, let who would order the contrary, my life being the deare&s;t thing I had to regard; and following him clo&s;e at his heels, with my cudgel clubbed upon my &s;houlder, I had the &s;atis|faction to be well hou&s;ed in the &s;pace of two hours. I mu&s;t not omit, that Colonel Fourgeoud, during the cri&s;is
<PB N="250" REF="305">
of my illne&s;s, had made me an offer of being tran&s;ported to Devil's Harwar; but this I refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 18th the news arrived, that poor Campbell died on the preceding day; and now Major Rughcop him|&s;elf was &s;ent down extremely ill, being the eleventh &s;ick officer during this &s;hort campaign. Being now almo&s;t &s;tarving for want of provi&s;ions, we were mo&s;t opportunely &s;upplied by a quantity of fi&s;h, particularly the <HI>jackee,</HI> already de&s;cribed as changing to a frog; and the <HI>warappa,</HI> which is of the &s;ame &s;ize, and equally good, both being very rich and fat; the&s;e fi&s;h were &s;o plentiful in the mar&s;hes, where they were left by the retreating waters, that our negroes caught many with their hands, but mo&s;tly by &s;triking at hazard in the mud with their bill-hooks and &s;abres; after which, gra&s;ping with their fingers, they brought up pieces and half fi&s;hes in great abundance. Another fi&s;h they al&s;o caught in the creek, called <HI>coemma-coemma,</HI> which is from one to three feet long, exceedingly &s;weet, but not near &s;o delicious as the <HI>jackee,</HI> or <HI>warappa,</HI> which two la&s;t the negroes generally &s;moak-dry or barbacue, and which I was glad to eat without either bread or &s;alt. The barbacuing con&s;i&s;ts in laying the fi&s;h upon twigs of wood above the fire, where, by the &s;moak, they dry to a con&s;i&s;tency that gives them no di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, and will pre&s;erve them for &s;everal weeks together: thus prepared, they require no further dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="306">On the 20th we detached a captain, with twenty pri|vates and twenty rangers, to reconnoitre the demoli&s;hed village of Boucou: on the following day Major Rughcop died; and now Colonel Fourgeoud re&s;olved to march him|&s;elf to Boucou, leaving me the command of four hun|dred men, white and black, two hundred of whom were &s;ick in their hammocks; but of that number I tran&s;ported thirty to die at Devil's Harwar, while I &s;ent &s;ixty rangers with leave down to Paramaribo. The&s;e latter went away declaring, that Fourgeoud's operations were only calculated to murder his own troops in&s;tead of the enemy's. Such is the nature of the negroes, that where they know no|thing is likely to be done, they will not march; it is in|deed extremely difficult to maintain proper di&s;cipline among them, and when they expect to &s;ee the enemy, nothing can po&s;&s;ibly keep them back. It is amazing to ob&s;erve, with what &s;kill one negro di&s;covers the haunts of another: while an European di&s;cerns not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of a man's foot in the fore&s;t, the roving eye of the negro-ranger catches the broken &s;prig, and faded leaf trod flat, without ever mi&s;&s;ing it; but when he finds the marks of the enemy being near, he can then no longer be re&s;trained. This undoubtedly is incon&s;i&s;tent with modern tactics, but indicates that &s;pirit of liberty, which in antient times alone completed the valiant &s;oldier; and &s;uch was at this time the native and natural &s;pirit of a people, who had but ye&s;terday been &s;laves.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="307">On the evening of the 21&s;t, I availed my&s;elf once more of being commandant, by &s;ending two barges for provi|&s;ions, the one to La Rochelle and the other to Devil's Harwar, which la&s;t brought back a box with Bo&s;ton bi&s;|cuit, &s;ent me from Paramaribo.</P>
<P>On this day two &s;laves were put in confinement, accu&s;ed of having taken pork from the magazine; and I was ad|dre&s;&s;ed by the troops to inflict an exemplary puni&s;hment, the common &s;oldiers de&s;pi&s;ing the negro &s;laves, as in their imagination greatly below them&s;elves, and &s;tupidly con|&s;idering them as the cau&s;es of their di&s;tre&s;s. Having found a large piece of pork in their cu&s;tody, yet having no proof that was &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the theft, I found my&s;elf greatly at a lo&s;s to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice with &s;atis|faction to both parties; the Europeans unmercifully ac|cu&s;ing, and the poor &s;laves vindicating their &s;tarved companions in &s;uch a clamorous &s;tyle, that the whole camp was in an uproar. The fir&s;t per&s;i&s;ted that the latter had &s;tolen it, and the others that they had &s;aved it from their allowance, to take to their families. Affect|ing, therefore, the &s;tile of a de&s;potic prince, I ordered fir&s;t a ring to be formed of the plaintiffs, and next the pri&s;oners to be let within it. I then, with a &s;tern and loud voice, commanded a block and a hatchet to be brought. It was with heart-felt &s;atisfaction that I found this &s;olemn apparatus, and the apprehen&s;ion that we might commit a ra&s;h and criminal action, &s;oon di&s;pelled every feeling of
<PB N="253" REF="308">
re&s;entment in the &s;oldiers, and I was implored by the very accu&s;ers to &s;hew mercy. Obdurately &s;topping my ear, however, to all intreaty from either &s;ide, I made a &s;trong negro &s;lave take up the hatchet, and in&s;tantly chop the <HI>pork</HI> into three equal pieces; when, giving one &s;hare to the pro&s;ecutors, another to the malefactors, and the third to the executioner for having <HI>&s;o well</HI> done his duty, the farce was ended to general &s;atisfaction, and I heard no more of robberies or complaints.</P>
<P>On the 24th in the evening, two officers of the Suri|nam Society troops arrived from Devil's Harwar, reco|vered from their late indi&s;po&s;ition. One of them, calling him&s;elf Le Baron de Z&mdash;b&mdash;h, and being infected with the <HI>e&s;prit de corps,</HI> on his arrival &s;eemed determined to e&s;pou&s;e Captain Meyland's cau&s;e, abruptly alledging, that I had di&s;graced him by epithets unbecoming his dignity. I was amazed, and being con&s;cious of my innocence, en|deavoured to explain the matter in a friendly manner, in which I was &s;econded by a Mr. Rulagh, one of my offi|cers; but the German, in&s;tead of being appea&s;ed, grew more outrageous, and plainly told me that he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;atisfaction. I never had le&s;s inclination to battle in all my life, I therefore left him without a reply, and walked towards my hut in the mo&s;t gloomy mood imagina|ble. It was not long, however, before I felt my indig|nation &s;uddenly re-kindle, when, armed with my &s;abre and pi&s;tols, I returned, fully determined to end the quar|rel in the moon-&s;hine. But now, finding the Baron re|tired to his hammock, I di&s;patched Mr. Rulagh with a
<PB N="254" REF="309">
&s;ummons, de&s;iring he would tell him, that if he did not in&s;tantly turn out to fight me, I &s;hould come in, cut down the clews of his hammock with my knife, and treat him as I thought his pride and in&s;olence de&s;erved. Upon this appeared a figure that will never be effaced from my memory.</P>
<P>The Baron was more than the middle &s;ize, extremely thin and &s;allow, his meagre vi&s;age ornamented with a pair of enormous red whi&s;kers under the no&s;e, while a white <HI>queue</HI> near three feet long adorned his graceful back. He was in his under-wai&s;tcoat, and walked on &s;tocking &s;oles, which were black &s;ilk, darned with white wor&s;ted; the&s;e hanging down upon his heels, di&s;covered his mi&s;erable &s;pindle &s;hanks; while on his head he wore a &s;triped wor&s;ted night-cap of all colours, al&s;o in many holes; and over his breech his valour was di&s;played by his colours, which hung out, but the <HI>blazon</HI> of which I mu&s;t not attempt to de&s;cribe. Such was the figure that now, with all humiliation, offered to give me a <HI>bu&s;s,</HI> and intreated my forgivene&s;s, pretending not to have under|&s;tood me; which <HI>la&s;t</HI> I having granted with a loud laugh and a dram of brandy, he faced about, and by the quick &s;tep re-entered his den.</P>
<P>On the 26th Colonel Fourgeoud, with his party, re|turned from his trip to Boucou, having &s;urrounded three &s;traggling rebel negroes unarmed, as they were cutting a cabbage-tree for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. While one of them, called <HI>Pa&s;&s;up,</HI> had e&s;caped, another was taken alive, and a third, with his thigh &s;hot to &s;hivers by a &s;lug cartridge,
<PB N="255" REF="310">
was fir&s;t la&s;hed hands and feet, and thus carried by two negroes on a pole, in the manner of a hog or a beer-barrel, bearing all the weight of his body upon his &s;hattered limbs, which were dropping with blood, with|out a plai&s;ter or a bandage to cover the wounds, and with his head hanging downwards all the time; in which man|ner the unhappy youth, for he had not the appearance of being twenty, had been brought through thick and thin for above &s;ix miles di&s;tance from the camp, while he might ju&s;t as well have been carried in one of the &s;pare hammocks of the &s;oldiers. I was &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed at this act of barbarity in Fourgeoud, whom I never had ob&s;erved to be cruel in his cooler moments to an indivi|dual; indeed I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, quite the rever&s;e, unle&s;s he was oppo&s;ed, as I mu&s;t own he &s;ome|times was by me; but on this occa&s;ion he was &s;o flat|tered with this trophy of victory, that every &s;park of feeling and humanity was extinct. The body being laid on a table, I implored one of the &s;urgeons, called Pino, to dre&s;s his wounds; on which, that he might &s;eem to do &s;omething, he put ju&s;t as many round patches as the &s;lugs had made holes, declaring he could never recover, and &s;inging <HI>Dragons pour boire</HI> during the operation.&mdash; Poor negro! what mu&s;t have been his feelings! The fever increa&s;ing, he begged for &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> water, which I gave him my&s;elf clean out of my hat, when he &s;aid, "Thank ye, me Ma&s;era," &s;ighed, and, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfac|tion,
<PB N="256" REF="311">
in&s;tantly expired. His companion, called September, was more fortunate, for Fourgeoud, in hopes of making &s;ome di&s;coveries, regaled and treated him with more di&s;|tinction than he did any of his officers; while Septem|ber, looking as wild as a fox newly caught, was put in the &s;tocks during the night; and his companion was in|terred by the negro &s;laves, with tho&s;e marks of commi&s;e|ration which his unhappy fate demanded from every human being. According to their cu&s;tom, they &s;pread his grave with the green boughs of the palm-trees, and offered a part of their &s;canty allowance by way of liba|tion. The following day Mr. Stoelman, the militia cap|tain, being arrived, to &s;tay one day only in the camp, I took the opportunity to remind Colonel Fourgeoud of what he had told me concerning his unbecoming in&s;inua|tions, which I begged him now to repeat in that gentle|man's hearing, as I was determined to have this matter cleared up, and to obtain that &s;atisfaction to which I thought my&s;elf entitled. But the gallant Colonel was not ea&s;ily brought to proof.&mdash;He now imputed all the blame to Major Rughcop, who was dead, and reque&s;ted of me to &s;ay nothing more about it. I left him with contempt, and &s;hook hands with my &s;uppo&s;ed adver&s;ary; and then, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize, told him all that had hap|pened. The con&s;equence was, that in le&s;s than two hours the captain quitted Fourgeoud and Jeru&s;alem in di&s;gu&s;t, and was followed by the remaining rangers.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="312">On the 29th, Captain de Borgnes was made major in Rughcop's place; but no new &s;ubalterns were created, Fourgeoud declaring he had no more materials to fabri|cate them with: which in part might be true among&s;t the &s;erjeants; but two brave youths, both gentlemen's &s;ons, who had entered as volunteers, and gone through every danger and fatigue, remained unnoticed in the ranks, the one named <HI>Sheffer,</HI> the other <HI>Meyer</HI>;&mdash;&s;uch ever was, and ever will be, <HI>too frequently,</HI> the con&s;equence of wanting friends and fortune.</P>

<P>We continued our march for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, with good weather; but I was every night awaked out of my &s;ound &s;leep by a &s;entinel, who was &s;ent by the colonel's orders to di&s;turb me, with a charge of having <HI>whi&s;tled</HI> or <HI>&s;poke.</HI></P>
<P>On the 3d we arrived once more at the Wana Creek. Here, after a fatiguing march, I flattered my&s;elf with the hope of recruiting my exhau&s;ted &s;trength and &s;pirits by a quiet night's re&s;t; but was once more awoken, though
<PB N="259" REF="314">
&s;o &s;ound was my &s;leep, that the &s;entinel was obliged to &s;hake me three or four times by the &s;houlder. I then &s;tarted up, denying the charge; but Fourgeoud him&s;elf, &s;itting upright in his hammock, now &s;wore, in a tremen|dous voice, that he was determined to <HI>hang</HI> and <HI>quarter</HI> whoever &s;hould dare to di&s;obey his orders, the dark and gloomy woods re&s;ounding with his bellowing threats. A deadly &s;ilence &s;ucceeded this &s;torm throughout the camp, till I happened to break it, by bur&s;ting out into an im|moderate fit of laughter, in which I was in&s;tantly accom|panied by &s;o many others, that he began to roar like thunder, without being able to di&s;tingui&s;h one per&s;on's voice from another. In this mu&s;ic he was &s;econded by a large toad, called here the <HI>pipa,</HI> to which mon&s;ter he ac|tually gave &s;helter in his hut, and which kept croaking every night, with &s;uch a voice as could only be exceeded by Fourgeoud him&s;elf, or by that of his countryman, a Swi&s;&s;erland bear. Morpheus I now invoked to befriend me again, but to no purpo&s;e, &s;uch was the impre&s;&s;ion which the&s;e &s;everal roarings had left on my mind;&mdash;and in this gloomy temper I &s;hall de&s;cribe this hateful gloomy animal, the colonel's dear companion, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>pipa,</HI> the large&s;t of all the toads in South America, if not in the world.</P>
<P>The <HI>pipa</HI> is an animal &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to partake of both the nature of the frog and the toad. It is the mo&s;t hideous of all creatures upon earth, covered over with a dark brown &s;crophulous &s;kin, very uneven, and marked with irregular black &s;pots; the hinder feet of the crea|ture
<PB N="260" REF="315">
are webbed, and the toes longer than tho&s;e before: thus it can both &s;wim and leap like a frog, in which it differs from other toads. Its &s;ize is often larger than a common <HI>duck</HI> when plucked and pinioned; and its croaking, which takes place generally in the night, in|conceivably loud. But what is mo&s;t remarkable in this mon&s;ter, is the manner of its propagation: the young ones being hatched till they become tadpoles, in a kind of watery cells on the back of the mother, in which the embrio's exi&s;tence fir&s;t commences; for on the back &s;he is impregnated by the male, and thence i&s;&s;ues this mo&s;t extraordinary birth.</P>
<P>Toads are not venomous, as is generally imagined, and are even tameable: as, for in&s;tance, Mr. Awcott fed one for many years, and Colonel Fourgeoud kept his as a do|me&s;tic favourite during the whole time of our campaign at Wana Creek; indeed I my&s;elf have &s;ince lodged a tame <HI>frog.</HI> That the la&s;t mentioned animals are eatable as far as their thighs, I al&s;o know by experience: but their ta&s;te is extremely in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>To return at once to my hammock and journal.&mdash;The croaking of this pipa; the hammering of another, which produces a loud and con&s;tant &s;ound of <HI>tuck, tuck, tuck,</HI> from &s;un-&s;et to &s;un-ri&s;e; the howling of the baboons; the hi&s;&s;|ing of the &s;nakes, tigers, &amp;c.; to which add the growling of Fourgeoud, and &s;ometimes heavy rains into the bargain, made the night very uncomfortable and gloomy indeed. The ri&s;ing &s;un, however, di&s;pelled my re&s;entment; and having taken a &s;ound nap during the day, I was as well
<PB N="261" REF="316">
after it, and as well plea&s;ed, as the fore&s;t of Guiana could make me.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 4th, I di&s;covered a couple of fine <HI>powe&s;as</HI> on the branches of a high tree near the camp, and reque&s;ted liberty from the chief to &s;hoot one of them, which however was bluntly refu&s;ed me, on pretence that the enemy might hear the report of my mu&s;quet, though by the way, if it be not a &s;oleci&s;m &s;o to expre&s;s my&s;elf, they knew better where we were than we did our&s;elves. A little after, however, a large &s;nake appearing on the top of another tree, it was ordered to be &s;hot immediately, whether from fear or antipathy I know not. On the di&s;charge of the mu&s;quet the animal fell to the ground, quite alive, and &s;lided in&s;tantly into a thicket near the magazine. Upon this occa&s;ion I had an opportunity of remarking the uncommon intrepidity of a &s;oldier, who creeping in after the reptile, brought it out from among the brambles, &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly pretending that he was invulnerable to its bite. However this may be, the &s;nake, which was above &s;ix feet long, erected its head and half its body &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to attack him, and he as often knocked it down with his fi&s;t, and at la&s;t with his &s;abre &s;evered it in two pieces, which ended the battle; for doing which he was regaled by Fourgeoud with a dram of rum.</P>
<P>Le&s;t I &s;hould be accu&s;ed of introducing a word which is probably new and unintelligible to my readers, I will beg leave to add, that the <HI>powe&s;a,</HI> or peacock-phea&s;ant of
<PB N="262" REF="317">
Guiana, is a beautiful bird indeed, about the &s;ize of a common turkey, to which it bears a re&s;emblance both in appearance and ta&s;te. Its feathers are a &s;hining black, except on the belly; its legs are yellow, and al&s;o its bill, except near the point, where it is blue and arched. Its eyes are lively and bright, and on its head it is cre&s;ted with a brilliant plume of black frizzled feathers, which give it a noble appearance. The&s;e birds cannot fly far; and being ea&s;ily tamed, may be reared for dome&s;tic pur|po&s;es: at Paramaribo they are frequently &s;old for more than a guinea a piece. Another bird peculiar to Guiana, called by the French the <HI>agame,</HI> and in Surinam <HI>cani-cani,</HI> I will al&s;o take this opportunity to de&s;cribe.&mdash;It is, like the former, nearly the &s;ize of a turkey, but totally different in its formation and plumage; its body, which has no tail, being perfectly the &s;hape of an egg: it is al&s;o black, except on the back, where it is of a grey colour, and on its brea&s;t, where the feathers are blue and long, hanging down like tho&s;e of the heron. The eyes are bright, the bill is pointed, and of a bluei&s;h green, as are al&s;o its legs. The vulgar name of this bird in this country is the <HI>trumpeter,</HI> on account of the &s;ound it frequently makes, which bears &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblance to that of a trum|pet, but whence that &s;ound proceeds is not in my power to certify: &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e it is made by the no&s;e. Of all the feathered creation this bird is the mo&s;t tameable, and the greate&s;t friend to man, whom it follows, care&s;&s;es, and even &s;eems to protect with the attachment of a dog. I

have &s;een many of them kept on the e&s;tates, where, like the powe&s;a, they are reared for dome&s;tic u&s;es, and feed among the turkeys and other poultry.</P>
<P>On the 6th I received &s;ix gallons of rum from Para|maribo, four of which I gave as a pre&s;ent to Fourgeoud.</P>
<P>About &s;ix in the evening two of our &s;laves, who had been out to cut manicoles, brought intelligence that a gang of rebels had pa&s;&s;ed not above a mile from the camp, headed by a Captain Arico, with whom they had &s;poken on the banks of the Cormoetibo Creek, but could not tell which way they &s;teered their cour&s;e, &s;o much had they been terrified. On this information we received orders to pur&s;ue them by break of day; and the next morning, at five o'clock, all was ready, and we again broke up, leaving a detachment with the &s;tores, and re|paired to the &s;pot whence the intelligence proceeded. Here we &s;aw a large palm or <HI>mawri&s;ee</HI> tree <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The large&s;t of all the palm &s;pecies.</NOTE>, floating in the river, and moored to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore by a nebee, which plainly indicated that Arico, with his men, had cro&s;&s;ed the creek, which they do by riding a&s;tride on the floating trunk, the one behind the other, in which man|ner they are ferried over, (&s;ometimes with women and children) by tho&s;e who are the be&s;t &s;wimmers.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this plain evidence, the faith of our colonel, Fourgeoud, now began to waver, and he averred that it was no more than a &s;tratagem of the rebels, who, he &s;aid, had come from the place to which we &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="264" REF="320">
them gone, and who had only tied the tree acro&s;s the river to deceive us.</P>
<P>To this opinion neither my&s;elf nor the other officers could &s;ub&s;cribe; but no arguments would prevail with him, and we marched directly from them, <HI>viz.</HI> ea&s;t, in|&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing and pur&s;uing them we&s;t, as the rangers would certainly have done: thus we kept on till it was near dark, though the bread was forgotten, and the whole day not a drop of water to be obtained, marching through high &s;andy heaths or &s;avannahs. After inclining a little to the right, we were ju&s;t upon the point of making a camp, when a negro called out that we were come to the Wana Creek. This in my ears was a wel|come &s;ound; and giving him a caleba&s;h, and the be&s;t part of a bottle of my rum, I de&s;ired him to run to the creek, and make me &s;ome grog, and this he did; but the poor fellow, never having made grog before, poured in all the &s;pirits and but very little water, doubtle&s;s think|ing, that the &s;tronger it was the better; which beverage I &s;wallowed to the bottom, without taking time to ta&s;te it, and I became in&s;tantly &s;o much intoxicated that I could hardly keep my feet.</P>
<P>On the 9th we found our&s;elves returned to our old camp, from a fruitle&s;s crui&s;e, when Colonel Fourgeoud &s;et the cap|tive negro September at liberty, who followed like a &s;hep|herd's dog attending a flock; but our commander in chief was indefatigable, and not only cro&s;&s;ed and reconnoitred the we&s;t &s;ide of the creek him&s;elf, but filling our knap&s;acks,
<PB N="265" REF="321">
we the next morning &s;et out in the &s;ame track we had kept the eighth, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ting that he &s;hould overtake the enemy. Having thus marched till towards dark, we altered our cour&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in an old camp of the rebel negroes, having again pa&s;&s;ed the whole day without water.</P>
<P>The following day we &s;till proceeded, but neither ene|mies nor water were to be found: the men and officers now began to be extremely faint, and &s;ome were already carried in their hammocks. It was by this time indeed in&s;ufferably hot, being in the very heart of the dry &s;ea|&s;on. In this dilemma we dug a hole &s;ix feet deep, in the bottom of which a ball cartridge being fired, a little moi&s;ture began to trickle forth, but &s;o &s;low and &s;o black, that it proved not to be of the lea&s;t u&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;till marched on, and encamped in an old weedy field, where the rebels &s;ome time before had cultivated plantations. During the night it was truly affecting to hear the poor &s;oldiers lament for want of drink, but to no purpo&s;e; for in &s;pite of all this mi&s;ery, Fourgeoud &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in going forward even the third day, build|ing his hopes on meeting with &s;ome creek or rivulet to alleviate this general di&s;tre&s;s. In this he was however mi&s;taken; for having again, on the 12th, marched over burning &s;ands till about noon, he dropped down him&s;elf, among&s;t a number of others, a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle, for want of means to &s;lake their raging and intolerable thir&s;t. It was happy that in this &s;ituation we were not at|tacked
<PB N="266" REF="322">
by the negroes, as it mu&s;t have been impo&s;&s;ible to make any re&s;i&s;tance, the ground being &s;trewed with di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects that appeared to be all of them in raging fevers. De&s;pair now &s;eemed to be impre&s;&s;ed even upon Fourgeoud's countenance, as he lay pro&s;trate on the earth, with his lips and tongue parched black; and in this con|dition, though &s;o little de&s;erving of it, he again attracted my pity.</P>
<P>During all this, &s;ome of the &s;oldiers &s;till devoured &s;alt pork, while others crept on all fours and licked the &s;canty drops of dew from the fallen leaves that lay &s;cattered on the ground. I now experienced the kindne&s;s of which a negro is capable when he is well treated by his ma&s;ter, being pre&s;ented by one attending me with a large cali|ba&s;h of as good water as ever I drank in my life; and this he met with, after un&s;peakable difficulty, in the leaves of a few wild pine-apple plants, from which it was extracted in the following manner:</P>
<P>The plant is held in one hand, and a &s;abre in the other, when at one blow it is &s;evered from the root, through the thick under parts of the leaves. It is then held over a cup or caliba&s;h, and the water flows pure, cool, and to the quantity &s;ometimes of a quart from each plant. This water has been caught in the time of the rains by the channeled leaves of the plant, and con|veyed to their proper re&s;ervoir. Some other negroes found means to relieve them&s;elves from the <HI>water-withy,</HI> but this was not &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t the dying troops.
<PB N="267" REF="323">
The <HI>water-withy</HI> is a kind of very thick nebee of the vine &s;pecies, which grows only in very &s;andy places, this being &s;la&s;hed with the &s;abre in long pieces, and &s;uddenly held to the mouth, produces a limpid &s;tream, and affords a plea&s;ing, cool, and healthy beverage, of great &s;ervice in the parching fore&s;ts of Guiana.</P>
<P>As Providence had graciou&s;ly &s;ent me this &s;upply, I could not for my &s;oul re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e of &s;haring my re|lief with poor Fourgeoud, who&s;e age and natural infirmi|ties pleaded greatly in his favour; and who, being now re|fre&s;hed, &s;aw him&s;elf at la&s;t obliged to return, without any further hope of overtaking the enemy. But &s;o exhau&s;ted was the party, that many were carried on long poles in their hammocks by the &s;laves.</P>
<P>As his la&s;t re&s;ource, our commander now detached the Berbicean negro, <HI>Gau&s;arie,</HI> by him&s;elf, to try if he could bring him any intelligence while we continued our retreat. As we returned by our former foot&s;teps, and of con&s;e|quence approached the pit we had dug ye&s;terday, I was convinced that by this time it mu&s;t contain clear water. I therefore di&s;patched my boy Quaco to the front, to fill one of my gallon bottles before it &s;hould be changed to a puddle, and this he did; but being met on his return by Colonel Fourgeoud, he with the butt end of his gun relentle&s;sly knocked the bottle to pieces, and doubling his pace, placed two &s;entinels at the pit, with orders to pre&s;erve the water all for him&s;elf and his favourites, But at this moment &s;ubordination being extingui&s;hed,
<PB N="268" REF="324">
the two protectors were forced headlong into the pit, fol|lowed by &s;everal others, who all fought to come at the water, which being now changed to a perfect mire, was good for nothing. Having &s;lung our hammocks in an old rebel camp, a dram of <HI>kill-devil</HI> was di&s;tributed to each without di&s;tinction; but, as I never u&s;ed this fluid, I offered my &s;hare to my faithful negro who had given me the water: this being ob&s;erved by old Fourgeoud, he or|dered it to be &s;natched out of the poor man's hand, and returned into the earthen jar; telling me,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I mu&s;t either drink it my&s;elf, or have none."</Q>
I was exceedingly ex|a&s;perated at this mark of ingratitude, and finding means to procure that very evening a whole bottle, I gave it to the &s;lave.</P>
<P>Near midnight, accidentally good water was di&s;covered &mdash;Good God! what joyful news!&mdash;how &s;weet the ta&s;te! &s;urpa&s;&s;ing any wine; and &s;uch as I &s;hall ever gratefully remember!&mdash;Now all drank heartily, and Fourgeoud or|dered a warm &s;upper to be boiled for him&s;elf, but not &s;o much as a fire to be lighted for any other per&s;on, for|bidding even the cutting of a &s;tick; thus were we forced to eat our &s;alt beef and pork <HI>raw.</HI> However, having tied my &s;mall allowance to a &s;tring, I hung it quietly over the &s;ide of <HI>his</HI> kettle, to have it dre&s;&s;ed; but his black cook chancing to drop a log of wood upon another in his eager|ne&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, alarmed the hero, when I was obliged to drop my luncheon into the kettle, and take to my heels.</P>
<P>The old gentleman now in&s;i&s;ting that &s;ome per&s;on had
<PB N="269" REF="325">
cut &s;ticks again&s;t his orders, I quietly &s;tepped up to his hammock in the dark, to undeceive him, and &s;oftly a&s;|&s;ured him that the whole camp was fa&s;t a&s;leep; when he, on pretence of not knowing me, &s;uddenly gave a loud roar, and with both his hands caught hold of me by the hair of the head. I e&s;caped, and got fairly under cover, while he called, "Fire at him! fire at him!" to the infi|nite amu&s;ement of the whole camp, who lay in their hammocks convul&s;ed with laughter. Having found out Quaco, I in&s;tantly &s;ent him back to bring my luncheon; and &s;uch was his diligence, that he actually brought me back a piece of beef at lea&s;t ten times as large as what I had left, with which I had once more the &s;atisfaction to regale the poor &s;laves: and thus ended this horrid day.</P>
<P>The 13th we once more returned to the Wana Creek, fatigued beyond the power of de&s;cription with the&s;e fruitle&s;s &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Here the old gentleman regaled his friends with my rum in my pre&s;ence, and without offering me a &s;ingle drop. Here al&s;o I found a letter from the i&s;land of Cey|lon in the Ea&s;t Indies, where my friend and relation, Mr. Arnoldus De Ly, being governor of Poind-de-Gale and Maturee, I was invited to come and find my fortune ready made, but which for the pre&s;ent my evil &s;tars prevented my accepting, as it would have been di&s;ho|nourable to leave the &s;ervice at this juncture.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="326">The following day the negro Gau&s;arie returned from his expedition, reporting that he had di&s;covered nothing.</P>
<P>Captain Fredericy, who had marched on the 20th ult. with forty men, white and black, from Jeru&s;alem, not having been heard of &s;ince, it was apprehended he had met with &s;ome dreadful accident, and, in con&s;equence, on the 15th, two captains, two &s;ubalterns, and fifty men, were di&s;patched to the river Marawina for &s;ome intel|ligence.</P>
<P>The po&s;t at the Marawina, which is called Vreden|burgh, con&s;i&s;ts of hou&s;es &s;urrounded with pali&s;ades in a kind of &s;quare, which are all built of the manicole-tree, with which the woods of Guiana &s;o much abound. On the outer &s;ide are a guard and four &s;entinels, and the fort it&s;elf is defended by &s;everal cannon. It is &s;ituated in an opening, on the banks of the river, where is placed a large flag, and where the garri&s;on communicates with the French po&s;t on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, both being &s;ituated at but little di&s;tance from the mouth of the Marawina. To give the be&s;t idea of this &s;pot, I &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader with a view of it, as al&s;o of our &s;ituation at the Wana Creek, which, however beautiful on paper, was a dreadful po&s;t to many unfortunate &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>In the annexed Drawing, three camps are di&s;tinctly ex|hibited; tho&s;e of Colonel Fourgeoud and of the de|cea&s;ed Major Rughcop, on both &s;ides of the Wana Creek, and that which was lately the rangers, directly op|po&s;ite to its mouth.</P>

<P><PB N="271" REF="328">The barges, &amp;c. were ordered on the &s;ame day to bring up provi&s;ions, and take down the &s;ick; but at this very time the whole camp was attacked by that dread|ful di&s;temper the bloody flux, which is both infectious and epidemical, and daily carried numbers to their grave. An emetic, or &s;ome other medicine, admini&s;tered at ran|dom, were the only relief in our power, as there was not a proper &s;urgeon on the &s;pot, all of them being engaged at the ho&s;pitals in Comewina and in Paramaribo.</P>
<P>The poor &s;laves were peculiarly unhappy, who, as I have &s;tated, having but half allowance, lived for months on the produce of the cabbage-tree, &s;eeds, roots, wild ber|ries, &amp;c. and to this circum&s;tance may be attributed the fir&s;t introduction of this dangerous di&s;ea&s;e into the camp. So &s;tarved indeed were the&s;e wretched negroes, that they tied ropes or nebees about their naked bodies, which is a practice of the Indians when their abdomens are &s;hrunk with hunger, as they find by experience, or at lea&s;t fancy, that the pain occa&s;ioned by want of food is relieved by the compre&s;&s;ion. I, however, with a few others, e&s;caped the infection, but I was laid up with a mi&s;erable bad cold and &s;welled foot; which di&s;ea&s;e is called the <HI>con&s;aca,</HI> and is not unlike our chilblains in Europe, as it occa|&s;ions a very great itching, particularly between the toes, whence i&s;&s;ues a watery fluid.</P>
<P>The negroes are very &s;ubject to this complaint, which they cure by applying the &s;kin of a lemon or lime, made as hot as they can bear it.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="329">I have frequently had occa&s;ion to mention our provi|&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;alt beef, pork, ru&s;k, bi&s;cuit, and water, for our allowance, which were dealt out regularly every five or &s;ix days; the two former having perhaps made the tour of the world, after leaving Ireland, and were even &s;o green, &s;o &s;limy, &s;o &s;tinking, and &s;ometimes &s;o full of worms, that at other times they would not have re|mained upon my &s;tomach; but I have not de&s;cribed our furniture. This, however, will not occupy much time, as it con&s;i&s;ted only of a &s;quare box or che&s;t for each offi|cer, to carry his linen, fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and &s;pirits, when he had either. The&s;e boxes &s;erved not only as cup-boards, but as chairs and tables in the camp. On a march they were carried on the head of a negro: I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, moreover, that we had no light after &s;ix o'clock in the evening, that of the moon excepted, when all was &s;olemn and melancholy beyond de&s;cription.</P>
<P>I had not &s;o much as a trencher, ba&s;on, &s;poon, or fork: for the fir&s;t and &s;econd I made a negro's caliba&s;h &s;erve me; a fork I wanted not, and a &s;poon but &s;eldom: in&s;tead of that article, therefore, I u&s;ed a folded leaf, agreeably to the practice of the &s;laves; and as for a knife, each per&s;on carried one in his pocket. I at la&s;t con|trived to make a lamp by breaking a bottle; in which having melted &s;ome pork, it produced a quantity of oil, and a &s;lip of my &s;hirt &s;erved for a wick. Nece&s;&s;ity is proverbially ingenious, and in &s;uch a &s;ituation every nicety is forgotten. Indeed, could I now have had what
<PB N="273" REF="330">
formerly I left upon my plate, I &s;hould have ardently thanked God for it.</P>
<P>When &s;peaking of ingenuity, I ought not to forget a number of pretty ba&s;kets which were made by the negroes in the camp, and which, they having taught me to con&s;truct, I al&s;o made to amu&s;e my&s;elf, and &s;ent them as pre&s;ents to &s;everal friends at Paramaribo. The&s;e ba&s;kets were compo&s;ed of a kind of &s;trong ligneous cord that is found in the bark of the cabbage-tree, and, as Dr. Ban|croft expre&s;&s;es it, con&s;i&s;ts of a web-like plexus, which is divided cro&s;s-wi&s;e in long, hard, poli&s;hed threads, brown and as tough as whalebone. The&s;e threads are drawn from it, and the filaments or fibres are made u&s;e of as withies are u&s;ed in England. For holding fi&s;h at ombre or quadrille, nothing can be better or more beautiful; but tho&s;e that are large for holding fruit, vegetables, &amp;c. are quite different, and made of a kind of bulru&s;h, called <HI>warimbo,</HI> which is fir&s;t &s;plit and deprived of its pithy &s;ub&s;tance: the thin nebees make al&s;o no bad ba&s;kets. The negroes here be&s;ides made curious nets, and even hammocks, of the &s;ilk gra&s;s plant.</P>
<P>This is a &s;pecies of wild aloe that grows in the woods: the leaves are indented and prickly, and contain longi|tudinally very &s;trong and &s;mall white fibres, which are brui&s;ed and beaten to hemp. With this we made ropes &s;tronger than any in Europe. The&s;e would an&s;wer perfectly for the rigging of &s;hips and other purpo&s;es, had it not been di&s;covered that they are &s;ooner liable to rot
<PB N="274" REF="331">
in the wet. This kind of hemp is &s;o very much like white &s;ilk, that the importation is forbidden in many countries, to prevent impo&s;ition by &s;elling it for the &s;ame; and the fraud is more difficult to be detected when it is art|fully mixed with &s;ilk. By the Indians this plant is called <HI>curetta,</HI> and in Surinam vulgarly Indian &s;oap, as it con|tains a &s;aponaceous, pulpy &s;ub&s;tance, which an&s;wers for wa&s;hing as common &s;oap, and is employed for that pur|po&s;e by the negroes and many others. Another plant much re&s;embling this, is by the black people termed <HI>baboon knifee,</HI> as it &s;ometimes cuts through the &s;kin to the very bone, of which I my&s;elf had &s;ome proofs in this wilderne&s;s, but without any ill con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In the manner I have already related the time was &s;pent during this period, in which the whole camp was de&s;titute of &s;tockings, &s;hoes, hats, &amp;c. Colonel Fourgeoud walked a whole day barefooted him&s;elf to furni&s;h an ex|ample of patience and per&s;everance, and to keep the few remaining troops from murmuring. In this re&s;pect I had fairly the advantage of all the company, my &s;kin be|ing (the &s;welled foot or con&s;aca, and a few &s;cratches ex|cepted) perfectly whole from my habit of walking thus, while not a &s;ound limb was to be found among the re&s;t, who&s;e legs in general were broken out in dreadful ulcers, with a di&s;charge of pus. I have already in part accounted for this inconvenience, and &s;hall &s;till farther account for it, by ob&s;erving, that while the &s;tockings and &s;hoes of the&s;e unhappy people remained, they were ne|ver
<PB N="275" REF="332">
off the feet of many wearers, who, after marching through water, mud, and mire, in this filthy condition, re&s;ted during the night in their hammocks, where, in fair weather, before morning this filth was dried upon their limbs, and in con&s;equence cau&s;ed an itching and redne&s;s on the &s;kin, which by &s;cratching broke out in many places; the&s;e wounds &s;oon became &s;crophulous, and ended in open &s;ores and ulcers, which, from the want of care and proper application, often changed to mortification and intolerable &s;wellings, by which &s;ome lo&s;t their limbs, and others even their lives when they were not &s;aved by amputation. Such were the cau&s;es, and &s;uch the effects of the evils we had to &s;truggle with; but they were far from the whole of our wretchedne&s;s, and might be called only the precur&s;ors of what we had &s;till to undergo.</P>
<P>At this time a compliment of a fine <HI>ham</HI> and a dozen of port-wine being &s;ent me by Captain <HI>Van Coeverden,</HI> I gave all in a pre&s;ent to poor Fourgeoud, who was ema|ciated with fatigue, except four bottles which I drank with the other officers; and next day, the 29th, I had the honour to be ordered on a patrol with Colonel <HI>des Borgnes</HI> and forty privates <HI>once more,</HI> to try if we could not take the negroes who had cro&s;&s;ed the creek <HI>three weeks</HI> before.</P>
<P>Having dropped down the river with a barge, in which we lay all night, we landed the following morning, and marched N. E.; after which, being without a compa&s;s, we &s;oon lo&s;t our way, and having cro&s;&s;ed a large &s;and-&s;avanna,
<PB N="276" REF="333">
&s;lung our hammocks in the &s;kirts of a thick and ob&s;cure wood. On the 31&s;t we again &s;et out the &s;ame cour&s;e, in hopes of meeting with the marks of &s;ome for|mer path cut upon the trees by &s;ome of our troops; but were mi&s;taken, for having got into a mar&s;h, where we waded till noon up to our chins, at the hazard of be|ing drowned, we &s;aw our&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of returning the &s;ame way we came, perfectly &s;oaked and in rags; and after a forced march encamped once more on the banks of Cormoetibo Creek, in &s;uch a heavy &s;hower of rain during the whole night as I did &s;eldom remem|ber, which cau&s;ed &s;o much confu&s;ion and hurry, each &s;triving to build his &s;hed, and get under cover fir&s;t, that I got a broken head, but per&s;evering was one of the fir&s;t in &s;linging my hammock; above which &s;preading green boughs, and under which having lighted a comfortable fire, I fell mo&s;t profoundly a&s;leep in the middle of the &s;moke, which &s;aved me from the &s;tings of the mu&s;qui|toes.</P>
<P>While &s;peaking of in&s;ects, I ought not to forget that this evening one of the negro &s;laves who had been look|ing for dry wood, pre&s;ented me, to my great &s;urprize, with a beetle no le&s;s than three or four inches in length, and above two in breadth, called in Surinam the <HI>rhinoce|ros,</HI> on account of its probo&s;cis or horn, which is hooked, forked, and thick as a goo&s;e-quill; on the head it has many hard poli&s;hed knobs; the limbs are &s;ix; the wings are large, and the whole animal is perfectly black, be|ing the large&s;t of all the beetle kind in America.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="334">In Guiana is al&s;o another &s;pecies of the&s;e in&s;ects, called the <HI>cerf-volant,</HI> or flying hart, from its extuberances re|&s;embling the horns of a &s;tag: both the&s;e beetles fly with an uncommon buzzing noi&s;e, and are &s;o &s;trong, that but very few birds dare to attack them. One of the greate&s;t plagues however we met with in the fore&s;t, was a fly as large as a common bee the &s;tings of which were almo&s;t equally powerful; the negroes call it the <HI>cow-fly</HI>; this I can be&s;t I think compare to what is called the <HI>hippobo&s;|cus</HI> or <HI>hore-fly</HI> in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Having &s;lept mo&s;t &s;oundly for &s;ix or &s;even hours, in &s;pite of the rains, the &s;moke, the mu&s;quitoes, and my broken head, I turned out perfectly refre&s;hed at five, and at &s;ix we commenced the year 1774, by marching up along the banks of the Cormoetibo till mid-day, when we ar|rived once more at the <HI>grand</HI> encampment at the mouth of the Wana Creek, from, as u&s;ual, a fruitle&s;s cruize.</P>
<P>On the 3d, to our joy returned al&s;o Captain Fredericy, with his party, bringing in a captive negro in chains, call|ed <HI>Cupido</HI>; and relating that a poor &s;oldier of the So|ciety troops, on receiving his pardon, when on his knees to be &s;hot, was gone out of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud being finally determined to break up this campaign, &s;ent out a party of &s;ixty men to cruize on the way to Patamaca before him.</P>
<P>I now wa&s;hed my &s;hirt, the la&s;t I had, in the Wana Creek (but was obliged to keep &s;wimming till it was dried by the &s;un) my letter, &s;ent for linen, having never reach|ed
<PB N="276" REF="335">
Paramaribo, and what I had brought with me being torn to rags.</P>
<P>On the 4th of January, at &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing, all were ready to decamp. Thus having &s;ent down the barges with the &s;ick to Devil's Harwar, we at la&s;t cro&s;&s;ed Cormoetibo Creek, and marched fir&s;t directly &s;outh for Patamaca, over &s;teep mountains covered with &s;tones and impregnated with minerals. This again con|tradicts Dr. Bancroft's ob&s;ervations, the&s;e mountains not being above twenty miles from the ocean, though he a&s;&s;erts that no hill is to be found at near fifty miles from the &s;ea. In the evening we encamped at the foot of a high hill, where we found a &s;mall rivulet of good water, and a number of manicole-trees, the two chief requi&s;ites. It is curious, and indeed beautiful, to be|hold, in the &s;pace of an hour, a green town &s;pring up as it were from nothing, and a little after all the fires light|ed, on which the men are boiling their hard fare, while others are employed in drying their cloaths; though, as I have &s;tated, this la&s;t was by no means a general rule, the greater number preferring to let them rot on their bodies.</P>
<P>This night, however, the whole camp was di&s;turbed by a diuretic complaint, occa&s;ioned by drinking the water we found here, which indeed was very pure, but was &s;o impregnated with minerals, that it ta&s;ted almo&s;t like that of Bath or the German Spa. This is a circum&s;tance which I think indicates that the&s;e mountains contain
<PB N="277" REF="336">
metals, if the Dutch would go to the expence of &s;earch|ing in their bowels.</P>
<P>On the 5th we marched the &s;ame cour&s;e again over mountains and dales, &s;ome of which were &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep that one or two of the &s;laves, not being able to a&s;cend them loaded, threw down their burdens, and de|&s;erted, not to the enemy, but found their way to their ma&s;ters e&s;tates, where they were pardoned; while others tumbled down, burthen and all, from top to bottom.</P>
<P>This evening we found our quarters ready-made, and lodged in the <HI>wigwams</HI> or huts that were left &s;tanding when the rice country was de&s;troyed, and Bonny with his men put to flight; in that where I lay I found a very curious piece of candle, which the rebels had left be|hind, compo&s;ed of bees-wax and the heart of a bulru&s;h.</P>
<P>Bonny's own hou&s;e, where Fourgeoud lodged, was a perfect curio&s;ity, having four pretty little rooms, and a &s;hed or piazza inclo&s;ed with neat manicole pali&s;ades.</P>
<P>The whole corps appearing on the 6th exce&s;&s;ively fa|tigued, Fourgeoud ordered a general day of re&s;t, only de|taching Captain Fredericy with &s;ix men, as he knew the country be&s;t, to reconnoitre the banks of the <HI>Claas Creek,</HI> a water that i&s;&s;ued from near this place in the upper parts of Rio Cottica. They were hardly marched when the eye of our chief by chance falling on me, he ordered me in&s;tantly to follow <HI>alone,</HI> and return with a report of what I could di&s;cover on the <HI>other</HI> &s;ide the creek. I overtook the party &s;oon, when after a &s;hort march we
<PB N="278" REF="337">
were in water up to our very arm-pits; Fredericy now ordered a retreat, but de&s;iring him to wait for me, I took off all my cloaths, and with only my &s;abre in my teeth, &s;wam by my&s;elf acro&s;s the Creek, where having ranged the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and finding nothing, I again &s;wam back, after which we all returned to the camp.</P>
<P>At noon, making my report to Colonel Fourgeoud, he was a&s;toni&s;hed indeed at this de&s;perate action, which in fact he had not expected; but I was not le&s;s amazed when he took me by the hand, entertaining me with a bottle of wine, and ordering Mon&s;ieur Laurant to &s;et &s;ome bacon-ham before me, to find, however incredible it may appear, that the one was actually &s;our, and the other creeping with live worms; while my own pro|vi&s;ions, <HI>now his,</HI> which were fre&s;h, were withheld me. This meanne&s;s &s;o much exa&s;perated me, that, &s;tarting up, I left Fourgeoud, his valet, his wine, and his reptiles, with that contempt which they de&s;erved, alleviating my hunger with a piece of dry ru&s;k bi&s;cuit and a barbacued fi&s;h, called <HI>warappa,</HI> which I got from a negro.</P>
<P>On the 7th of January we marched again; and this day having caught one of tho&s;e beautiful large <HI>butterflies</HI> of which I made mention during my cruize in the river Cottica, I will here attempt to give a more particular de|&s;cription of it, though I know nothing about their names. This fly mea&s;ured, in the exten&s;ion of the wings from tip to tip, about &s;even inches; the colour of both the &s;uperior and inferior wings is of &s;uch a vivid and &s;plendid
<PB REF="338">

<PB N="279" REF="339">
blue, as can only be compared to the azure &s;ky in a bright day, to which not the pure&s;t ultramarine coloured &s;attin can approach: the under &s;ide is of a lovely brown variegated with &s;pots. I cannot help repeating, that its &s;kimming and hovering with &s;uch a magnitude, and &s;uch a hue, among the different &s;hades of green, had the mo&s;t enchanting effect. Of the antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen, I &s;hall only &s;ay that they were dark co|loured. This fly, if I mi&s;take not, is, according to the divi&s;ion of Linnaeus, of the Danai &s;pecies. I never &s;aw the chry&s;alite or aurelia; but the caterpillar, which is of a yellowi&s;h grey colour, is as thick as a large man's finger, and about four inches long. The annexed draw|ing I have improved from one of Mi&s;s Merian. Various and innumerable indeed are the butterflies with which the fore&s;ts of Guiana abound; &s;ome people, in fact, who make fly-catching their bu&s;ine&s;s, get much money by it; and having arranged them in paper-boxes, with pins &s;tuck through them, &s;end them off to the different cabi|nets of Europe. Doctor Bancroft mentions, touching them with &s;pirits of turpentine as nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve them, but fixing a piece of camphor in the box with the flies is quite &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>This evening we encamped near the Patamaca Creek, where the poor negro woman cried bitterly, and &s;cat|tered &s;ome victuals and water at the root of a tree by way of libation, as being the &s;pot where her hu&s;band was
<PB N="280" REF="340">
interred, who had been &s;hot in &s;ome former &s;kirmi&s;h by the Europeans.</P>
<P>Here Captain Fredericy and my&s;elf, walking without the &s;kirts of the camp in a &s;andy &s;avannah, di&s;covered the fre&s;h foot&s;teps of a large tiger with her young, at which time they are extremely ferocious: we thought it prudent therefore to make a &s;udden retreat. I mea|&s;ured the diameter of the dam's claws printed in the &s;and, which were nearly of the dimen&s;ions of an ordi|nary pewter-plate.</P>
<P>Having marched a few hours longer the &s;ucceed|ing morning, we at la&s;t arrived at the Society po&s;t La Rochelle in Patamaca; &s;uch a di&s;play of meagre, &s;tarved, black, burnt, and ragged tatterdemallions, and mo&s;tly without &s;hoes or hats, as I think were never before be|held in any country. They could be compared to no|thing but a gang of gyp&s;ies, while their leader was not unlike Bampfield Moore Carew, and my&s;elf at be&s;t like the forlorn Cru&s;oe in his wor&s;t condition, with my only check &s;hirt and the one-half of my trow&s;ers, the re&s;t being torn away. Here we found a &s;et of poor wretches ready to enter the woods which we had ju&s;t left, and de&s;|tined to undergo in the &s;ame manner the &s;evere&s;t mi&s;ery that ever was inflicted on &s;ublunary beings. I have al|ready mentioned the prickly heat, ring-worm, dry gripes, putrid fevers, biles, con&s;aca, and bloody flux, to which human nature is expo&s;ed in this climate; al&s;o the mu&s;|quitoes, Patat and Scrapat lice, chigoes, cock-roaches,
<PB N="281" REF="341">
ants, hor&s;e-flies, wild-bees, and bats, be&s;ides the thorns, briers, the alligators, and peree in the rivers; to which if we add the howling of the tigers, the hi&s;&s;ing of &s;er|pents, and the growling of Fourgeoud, the dry &s;andy &s;a|vannas, unfordable mar&s;hes, burning hot days, cold and damp nights, heavy rains, and &s;hort allowance, the reader may be a&s;toni&s;hed how any per&s;on was able to &s;urvive the trial. Notwith&s;tanding this black catalogue, I &s;olemnly declare I have omitted many other calamities that we &s;uffered, as I wi&s;h to avoid prolixity, though per|haps I have been already too often guilty of it. I might have mentioned indeed lethargies, drop&s;ies, &amp;c. &amp;c. be|&s;ides the many &s;mall &s;nakes, lizards, &s;corpions, locu&s;ts, bu&s;h-&s;piders, bu&s;h-worms, and centipedes, nay, even flying lice, with which the traveller is perpetually tor|mented, and by which he is con&s;tantly in danger of being &s;tung; but the de&s;cription of which cur&s;ed com|pany I mu&s;t defer to another opportunity.</P>
<P>The reader may form &s;ome conception of the fami&s;hed &s;tate in which we came hither, when I inform him, that the moment of our arrival, ob&s;erving a negro woman &s;upping on plantain broth from a calliba&s;h, I gave her half-a-crown, and &s;natching the ba&s;on from her hands, I devoured the contents with a greater reli&s;h than I have ever ta&s;ted any delicacy before or &s;ince during my whole exi&s;tence. I now ob&s;erved to Colonel Fourgeoud, how pitiable it was, not to regale his remaining &s;oldiers with vegetables and fre&s;h beef or mutton, be&s;ides providing
<PB N="282" REF="342">
them with hats, &s;tockings, &s;hoes, &amp;c.; but he replied, that Hannibal had lo&s;t his army at Capua by too much indulgence. In &s;hort, he quoted not only Hannibal but Horace for his example, according to the advice given in a certain pamphlet,
<Q>Ibit eo quo vis qui Zonam perdidit;</Q>
and appeared fully convinced, that no per&s;ons will behave &s;o de&s;perately in action as tho&s;e who are tired of their lives.</P>
<P>On the 11th, the other party which had left Wana the day before our&s;elves, arrived, having, according to cu&s;|tom, neither taken nor &s;een any thing.</P>
<P>On the 12th, one of the rebels with his wife came to La Rochelle, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves voluntarily to the commander in chief. This day Fourgeoud acquaint|ed me now him&s;elf, that I was at liberty to go and refit at Paramaribo when I thought proper. This propo&s;al I gladly accepted, and that moment prepared for my de|parture, with &s;ome other officers, leaving behind us him|&s;elf and a band of &s;uch &s;care-crows as would have di&s;|graced the garden or field of any farmer in England. Among the&s;e was a Society captain, named Larcher, who declared to me he never combed, wa&s;hed, &s;haved, or &s;hifted, or even put off his boots, till all was rotted from his body. At la&s;t arrived the happy hour, when, taking leave of my tattered companions, I and five more, with a
<PB N="283" REF="343">
tent-boat and &s;ix oars, rowed &s;trait down for Paramaribo, &s;till in good health and in a flow of &s;pirits, and at the very &s;ummit of contentment.</P>
<P>At Devil's Harwar I met a cargo of tea, coffee, bi&s;cuit, butter, &s;ugar, lemons, rum, and twenty bottles of claret, &s;ent me by my friends, directed to La Rochelle, which I again, notwith&s;tanding the barbarous u&s;age that I had &s;o lately met with, gave all in a pre&s;ent to poor Fourgeoud, twelve bottles of wine excepted, which we drank in the barge to the healths of our wives and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; nor could I help pitying Colonel Fourgeoud, who&s;e age (he being about &s;ixty) and indefatigable exertions claimed the attention of the mo&s;t indifferent: for during this trip, though but few rebels were taken, he had certainly &s;cour|ed the fore&s;t from the river Comewina to the mouth of the Wana Creek, di&s;per&s;ed the enemy, and demoli&s;hed their habitations, fields, and gardens, and thus cut them off from all pro&s;pect of &s;upport.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 13th, we &s;upped at the e&s;tate Monde&s;ire, and thence kept rowing down all night and day, &s;houting and &s;inging till the 15th at noon, when, the tide &s;erving, we went on &s;hore at the fortre&s;s Am&s;ter|dam; whence cro&s;&s;ing the river, we arrived before Mr. De Lamar's door at Paramaribo. I &s;tept a&s;hore among a croud of friends, who all flocked round to &s;ee and to welcome me to town.</P>
<P>I next &s;ent for my ine&s;timable Joanna, who bur&s;t
<PB N="284" REF="344">
into tears the moment &s;he beheld me, not only for joy at my &s;till exi&s;ting (for it had been reported that I was no more) but al&s;o from &s;eeing my very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;itua|tion.&mdash;Thus ended my &s;econd campaign, and with this I put an end to the chapter.</P>

<P>BEING once more arrived at Paramaribo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII.</NOTE> it will not be improper to introduce in this place &s;ome account of that beautiful town. Before I commence the de&s;crip|tion however, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that being long accu&s;tomed to walk bare-footed, I could not bear the confinement of &s;hoes and &s;tockings for &s;ome time, they heated and even &s;welled my feet &s;o much, that, dining on the 16th of Ja|nuary with my friend Kennedy, I was actually obliged to throw them off at his hou&s;e, whence he was &s;o kind as to &s;end me home in his whi&s;ky. I have already mentioned that Paramaribo is &s;ituated on the right &s;ide of the beau|tiful river Surinam, at about &s;ixteen or eighteen miles di&s;tance from its mouth. It is built upon a kind of gra|velly rock, which is level with the re&s;t of the country, in the form of an oblong &s;quare, its length is about a mile and a half, and its breadth about half as much. All the &s;treets, which are perfectly &s;traight, are lined with orange, &s;haddock, tamarind, and lemon-trees, which appear in everla&s;ting bloom; while at the &s;ame time their branches
<PB N="286" REF="346">
are weighed down with the riche&s;t clu&s;ters of odoriferous fruit. Neither &s;tone nor brick is made u&s;e of here for pavement, the whole being one continued gravel, not in|ferior to the fine&s;t garden walks in England, and &s;trewed on the &s;urface with &s;ea-&s;hells. The hou&s;es, which are mo&s;tly of two, and &s;ome of three &s;tories high, are all built of fine timber, a very few excepted; mo&s;t of the foundations are of brick, and they are roofed with thin &s;plit boards, called &s;hingles, in&s;tead of &s;lates or tiles. Win|dows are very &s;eldom &s;een in this country, gla&s;s being inconvenient on account of the heat, in&s;tead of which they u&s;e gauze frames; &s;ome have only the &s;hutters, which are kept open from &s;ix o'clock in the morning un|til &s;ix at night. As for chimnies I never &s;aw one in the colony, no fires being lighted except in the kitchens, which are always built at &s;ome di&s;tance from the dwel|ling-hou&s;e, where the victuals are dre&s;&s;ed upon the floor, and the &s;moke let out by a hole made in the roof: the&s;e timber hou&s;es are however very dear in Suri|nam, as may be evinced by that lately built by Governor Nepven, which he declared had co&s;t him above &pound;. 15,000 &s;terling. There is no &s;pring water to be met with in Paramaribo, mo&s;t hou&s;es have wells dug in the rock, which afford but a bracki&s;h kind of beverage, only u&s;ed for the negroes, cattle, &amp;c. and the Europeans have re|&s;ervoirs or ci&s;terns, in which they pre&s;erve rain-water for their own con&s;umption; tho&s;e of nicer ta&s;te let it fir&s;t drop through a filtering-&s;tone into large jars or earthen

Some people indeed lie on bed&s;teads; in that ca&s;e they are &s;urrounded, in&s;tead of curtains, with gauze pavilions, which admit the air freely, and at the &s;ame time keep off the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ect. The hou&s;es in general at Parama|ribo are elegantly furni&s;hed with paintings, gilding, cry&s;tal chandeliers, china jars, &amp;c.; the rooms are never papered or plai&s;tered, but beautifully wain&s;coted with cedar, Brazil, and mahogany wood.</P>
<P>The number of buildings in Paramaribo is computed at about one thou&s;and four hundred, of which the prin|cipal is the governor's palace, whence there is a private pa&s;&s;age through the garden which communicates with Fort Zelandia.&mdash;This hou&s;e, and that of the commandant, which has lately been burnt, were the only brick build|ings in the colony. The town-hall is an elegant new building, and covered with tiles; here the different courts are held, and underneath are the pri&s;ons for European delinquents, the military excepted, who are confined in the citadel of Fort Zelandia. The Prote&s;tant church,
<PB N="288" REF="350">
where divine wor&s;hip is performed both in French and Low Dutch, has a &s;mall &s;pire with a clock; be&s;ides which there is a Lutheran chapel, and two elegant Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogues, one German, the other Portu|gue&s;e. Here is al&s;o a large ho&s;pital for the garri&s;on, and this man&s;ion is never empty. The military &s;tores are kept in the fortre&s;s, where the Society &s;oldiers are al&s;o lodged in barracks, with proper apartments for &s;ome offi|cers. The town of Paramaribo has a noble road for &s;hip|ping, the river before the town being above a mile in breadth, and containing &s;ometimes above one hundred ve&s;&s;els of burthen, moored within a pi&s;tol &s;hot of the &s;hore; there are indeed &s;eldom fewer there than four&s;core &s;hips loading coffee, &s;ugar, cacao, cotton, and indigo, for Holland, including al&s;o the Guinea-men that bring &s;laves from Africa, and the North American and Leeward I&s;land ve&s;&s;els, which bring flour, beef, pork, &s;pirits, herrings, and mackarel &s;alted, &s;permaceti-candles, hor&s;es, and lum|ber, for which they receive chiefly mela&s;&s;es to be di&s;|tilled into rum. This town is not fortified, but is bound|ed by the river on the S. E.; by a large &s;avannah on the W.; by an impenetrable wood on the N. E.; and is pro|tected by Fort Zelandia on the ea&s;t. This citadel is only &s;eparated from the town by a large e&s;planade, where the troops parade occa&s;ionally. The fort is a regular pen|tagon, with one gate fronting Paramaribo, and two ba&s;|tions which command the river; it is very &s;mall but &s;trong, being made of rock or hewn &s;tone, &s;urrounded
<PB REF="351">

<PB N="289" REF="352">
by a broad fo&s;&s;e well &s;upplied with water, be&s;ides &s;ome out-works. On the Ea&s;t &s;ide, fronting the river, is a bat|tery of twenty-one pieces of cannon. On one of the ba&s;tions is a clock, which is &s;truck with a hammer by the &s;entinel, who is directed by an hour-gla&s;s. On the other is planted a large en&s;ign-&s;taff, upon which a flag is hoi&s;ted upon the approach of &s;hips of war, or on public rejoicing days. The walls are &s;ix feet thick, with embra&s;ures but no parapet. I have already &s;poken of its antiquity.</P>
<P>Paramaribo is a very lively place, the &s;treets being ge|nerally crouded with planters, &s;ailors, &s;oldiers, Jews, Indians, and Negroes, while the river is covered with canoes, barges, &amp;c. con&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing, like the wherries on the Thames, often accompanied with bands of mu&s;ic; the &s;hipping al&s;o in the road adorned with their different flags, guns firing, &amp;c.; not to men|tion the many groupes of boys and girls playing in the water, altogether form a plea&s;ing appearance; and &s;uch gaiety and variety of objects &s;erve, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to compen&s;ate for the many inconveniencies of the climate. Their carriages and dre&s;s are truly magnificent; &s;ilk em|broidery, Genoa velvets, diamonds, gold and &s;ilver lace, being daily worn, and even the ma&s;ters of trading &s;hips appear with buttons and buckles of &s;olid gold. They are equally expen&s;ive at their tables, where every thing that can be called delicate is produced at any price, and &s;erved up in plate and china of the newe&s;t fa&s;hion, and
<PB N="290" REF="353">
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. But nothing di&s;plays the luxury of the inhabitants of Surinam, more than the number of &s;laves by whom they are attended, often twenty or thirty in one family. White &s;ervants are &s;eldom to be met with in this colony.</P>
<P>The current money, as I have already &s;tated, are &s;tamped cards of different value, from five &s;hillings to fifty pounds: gold and &s;ilver is &s;o &s;carce, that the exchange premium for &s;pecie is often above ten <HI>per cent.</HI> A ba&s;e Dantzic coin called a <HI>bit,</HI> value &s;omething le&s;s than &s;ixpence, is al&s;o current in Surinam. Engli&s;h and Portugue&s;e coin are &s;ometimes met with, but mo&s;tly u&s;ed as ornaments by the Mulatto, Samboe, Quaderoon, and Negro girls. The Negro &s;laves never receive any paper money, for as they cannot read they do not under&s;tand its value; be|&s;ides in their hands it would be liable to many acci|dents, from fire or children, and particularly from the rats, when it becomes a little grea&s;y.</P>
<P>This town is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> but|cher's meat, fowls, fi&s;h and veni&s;on. Vegetables in par|ticular the country abounds with; be&s;ides the luxuries peculiar to this climate, they import whatever Europe, Africa, and A&s;ia can afford. Provi&s;ions, however, are ex|ce&s;&s;ively dear in general, e&s;pecially tho&s;e imported, which are mo&s;tly &s;old by the Jews and ma&s;ters of &s;hips. The fir&s;t enjoy extraordinary privileges in this colony; the latter erect temporary warehou&s;es for the purpo&s;e of trade, during the time their &s;hips are loading with the
<PB N="291" REF="354">
productions of the climate. Wheat flour is &s;old from four pence to one &s;hilling <HI>per</HI> pound; butter two &s;hil|ling's; butcher's meat never under one &s;hilling, and often at one &s;hilling and &s;ix pence; ducks and fowls from three to four &s;hillings a couple. A &s;ingle turkey has co&s;t me one guinea and a half; eggs are &s;old at the rate of five, and European potatoes twelve for &s;ix pence. Wine three &s;hillings a bottle. Jamaica rum a crown a gallon. Fi&s;h and vegetables are cheap, and fruit almo&s;t for nothing. My black boy, Quaco, has often brought me forty oranges for &s;ix pence, and half a dozen pine-apples for the &s;ame price; while limes and tamarinds may be had for gathering. Hou&s;e-rent is exce&s;&s;ively high. A &s;mall room unfurni&s;hed co&s;ts three or four guineas a month; and a hou&s;e with two apartments on a floor, lets for one hundred guineas yearly. Shoes &s;ell for half-a-guinea a pair; and a &s;uit of cloaths, with &s;ilver binding, has co&s;t me twenty guineas.</P>
<P>The wood with which the hou&s;es are generally built de&s;erves al&s;o to be noticed, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Wana,</HI> and the <HI>Cuppy.</HI> The Wana is a light durable timber of a coar&s;e grain, and does not take the be&s;t poli&s;h; it is of a very pale red, ap|proaching mahogany, and mo&s;tly u&s;ed for doors and cup-boards, al&s;o for boats and barges. This tree grows to a con&s;iderable height<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Dr. Bancroft, I think, calls the <HI>Tetermer.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="355">The Cuppy-tree re&s;embles the wild che&s;nut, is hard, knotty, and durable; it is &s;awed into boards, and u&s;ed to enclo&s;e the hou&s;es for fences, in&s;tead of brick and &s;tone walls; the timber is of a brown colour, and takes a good poli&s;h.</P>
<P>For a better idea of this town, I &s;hall refer the reader to the annexed plan; and proceed to give &s;ome further account of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>The whites or Europeans in this colony, and who re|&s;ide principally in town, are computed at five thou&s;and, including the garri&s;on. The negro &s;laves at about &s;eventy-five thou&s;and. The military mount guard every morning at eight o'clock, in the fortre&s;s; but the &s;afety of the town is entru&s;ted to the burghers or militia, who keep watch during the night. At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and the &s;ame hour in the evening, the morning and evening guns are fired by the commanding &s;hip in the harbour; at the evening &s;ignal, all the flags are in&s;tantly lowered on board the different ve&s;&s;els; their bells are &s;et a ringing, whil&s;t the drums and fifes beat the <HI>tattoo</HI> through the town. The watch is then &s;et, and no negro of either &s;ex is allowed to appear in the &s;treets or on the river, without a proper pa&s;s &s;igned by his owner; without this he is taken up, and infallibly flogged the next morning. At ten at night, a band of black drums beat the burgher, or militia retreat, through the &s;treets of Paramaribo.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="356">At this time the ladies begin to make their appearance, who are particularly fond of a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> by moon-light, when they entertain with <HI>Sherbet, Sangaree</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Water, Madeira wine, nutmeg and &s;ugar.</NOTE>, and wine and water; be&s;ides the mo&s;t unre&s;erved and unequivocal conver&s;ation concerning them&s;elves, as well as the pecu|liar qualifications of their hu&s;bands, and the &s;ituation of their female &s;laves, whom they propo&s;e the acceptance of to the gentlemen they conver&s;e with at &s;o much <HI>per</HI> week, according to their own e&s;timation. Sometimes placing half a dozen of them in a row, the lady &s;ays, "Sir, this is a <HI>calleba&s;ee,</HI> that is a maid, and this is not"&mdash; thus are they not only unre&s;erved in their conver&s;ation, but al&s;o profu&s;e in their encomiums upon &s;uch gentle|men as have the honour of their in&s;tructive company, and who&s;e per&s;on or figure meets with their appro|bation.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o rigid di&s;ciplinarians, as the backs of their poor &s;laves, male and female, &s;ufficiently te&s;tify. Thus every country has its cu&s;toms, and from the&s;e cu&s;toms exceptions are to be made; for I have known ladies in Surinam, who&s;e delicacy and polite conver&s;ation would have graced the fir&s;t circles in Europe. Be&s;ides the amu&s;ements of fea&s;ting, dancing, riding, and cards, they have a &s;mall theatre, where the inhabitants of fa&s;hion act plays for their own amu&s;ement, and that of their friends. As they are elegant in their dre&s;s, &s;o they
<PB N="294" REF="357">
keep their hou&s;es extremely clean. They u&s;e the fine&s;t linen, exqui&s;itely well wa&s;hed with Ca&s;tile &s;oap; its white|ne&s;s can only be compared to mountain &s;now, and would make the be&s;t bleached linen in Europe appear like canva&s;s. Their parlour floors are always &s;coured with &s;our oranges cut through the middle, which gives the hou&s;e an agreeable fragrance: the Negro girls taking one half in each hand, keep &s;inging aloud while they rub the boards. Such is the town, and &s;uch are the inhabi|tants of Paramaribo, the capital of Surinam; and the character will apply to the natives of all the Dutch &s;ettle|ments in the We&s;t Indies. But to return to my narrative. Being once more reconciled to &s;hoes, I vi&s;ited Colonel We&s;terloo on board a We&s;t-India &s;hip, bound for Holland. This gentleman, who had relieved me at Devil's Harwar when I was ill, was now him&s;elf in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable con|dition, having lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs. In this debili|tated &s;tate, it was doubtful whether any thing but the air of his native country would recover him. Several officers were now under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling their effects to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, not being able either to procure their pay or allowance from Fourgeoud. I felt this hard u&s;age the le&s;s, from the kindne&s;s I experienced from my numerous friends.</P>
<P>On the 28th of January, as I was walking in the morn|ing by the river &s;ide, I &s;aw a fi&s;h brought a&s;hore, that de&s;erves to be mentioned for its &s;ize and goodne&s;s, being
<PB N="295" REF="358">
&s;ometimes near two hundred pounds weight <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fermyn is mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays this fi&s;h weighs but forty pounds.</NOTE>. It is here called <HI>grow-muneck,</HI> or grey friar, and is &s;aid to be of the cod genus, to which it bears &s;ome re&s;emblance in &s;hape and colour, the back being a dark olive brown, and the belly white; it was &s;oon cut up into large &s;lices, &s;everal of which I purcha&s;ed, and &s;ent as pre&s;ents to my friends; as it was, in my opinion, even &s;uperior to turbot. It is an inhabitant of the &s;ea, but is &s;ometimes to be met with in the rivers. The negroes here are the only fi&s;her|men, and are regularly trained up to this profe&s;&s;ion by their ma&s;ters, who make them pay a certain &s;um weekly. If they are expert and indu&s;trious, they &s;oon acquire money for them&s;elves, and &s;ome even become <HI>rich</HI>; but, on the contrary, if they are indolent, and do not fulfil their weekly engagements, they are certain to be puni&s;hed very &s;everely.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom is al&s;o common to many other trades, and by per&s;everance and &s;obriety they are actually enabled to live happily. Thus I have known &s;laves in Surinam, who have bought &s;laves for their own u&s;e. Some purcha&s;e their freedom from their ma&s;ters, whil&s;t others keep their money, preferring to be the &s;lave of an indulgent ma&s;ter; being, &s;o long as they continue &s;laves, free from all duties and taxes, which, in ca&s;e of manumi&s;&s;ion, they become liable to. A particular in&s;tance of this kind was a negro black&s;mith, named <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who being offered his
<PB N="296" REF="359">
liberty upon account of his long and faithful &s;ervices, po&s;itively refu&s;ed it, chu&s;ing rather to be the &s;lave of a worthy ma&s;ter. This man had &s;everal &s;laves of his own, kept a decent hou&s;e, with hand&s;ome furniture, and &s;ome plate; and when vi&s;ited by his humane ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s, entertained them with Sangaree, port or claret. I mu&s;t, however, acknowledge this to be a very &s;ingular in&s;tance; and ob&s;erve, that although a few live comfortably at Pa|ramaribo, the greate&s;t number are wretched, particularly tho&s;e governed by a <HI>lady,</HI> who have many weals to &s;how, but not the &s;malle&s;t indulgence to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Among the &s;laves, tho&s;e of the cla&s;s called <HI>Quaderoons</HI> are in general much re&s;pected for their affinity to Eu|ropeans; a Quaderoon being the offspring of a white and a mulatto, and they are very numerous in this colony.</P>
<P>Here one not only meets with the white, the black, and olive, but with

<L>"The Mae&s;ti fair <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The offspring of an <HI>European</HI> and of a <HI>Quaderoon.</HI></NOTE>, the well-limb'd Quaderoon."</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e boys are generally placed out to &s;ome good trade, &s;uch as cabinet-makers, &s;ilver&s;miths, or jewellers; whil&s;t the girls are employed as waiting-women, and taught the arts of &s;ewing, knitting, and embroidery, to perfection: they are generally hand&s;ome, and take much pride in the neatne&s;s and elegance of their dre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB REF="360"><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="297" REF="361">To give the reader a more lively idea of the&s;e people, I &s;hall de&s;cribe the figure and dre&s;s of a Quaderoon girl, as they u&s;ually appear in this colony. They are mo&s;tly tall, &s;traight, and gracefully formed; rather more &s;lender than the Mulattoes, and never go naked above the wai&s;t, like the former. Their dre&s;s commonly con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;attin petticoat, covered with flowered gauze; a clo&s;e &s;hort jacket, made of be&s;t India chintz or &s;ilk, laced before, and &s;hewing about an hand-breadth of a fine mu&s;lin &s;hift between the jacket and the petticoat. As for &s;tock|ings and &s;hoes, the &s;laves in this country never wear them. Their heads are adorned with a fine bunch of black hair in &s;hort natural ringlets; they wear a black or white beaver hat, with a feather, or a gold loop and button: their neck, arms, and ancles are ornamented with chains, bracelets, gold medals, and beads. All the&s;e fine women have European hu&s;bands, to the no &s;mall mortification of the fair Creolians; yet &s;hould it be known that an European female had an intercour&s;e with a &s;lave of any denomination, &s;he is for ever dete&s;ted, and the &s;lave lo&s;es his life without mercy.&mdash;Such are the de&s;potic laws of men in Dutch Guiana over the weaker &s;ex.</P>
<P>But to change the &s;ubject.&mdash;The tyranny of our com|mander, Colonel Fourgeoud, &s;eemed daily to increa&s;e. Lieutenant Count Runtwick, who was to proceed for Holland with Colonel We&s;terloo, being &s;ick, was ordered to remain in Surinam, for having only &s;aid that he had
<PB N="298" REF="362">
been ill treated by him. As a &s;pecimen of his ju&s;tice, I will only ob&s;erve, that all the officers had now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a whole year upon a private &s;oldier's allowance of &s;alt provi&s;ions, a few weeks at Paramaribo only excepted. This accommodation co&s;t me thirty pounds; but I have already mentioned he kept back our money, and why &s;hould he not our allowance al&s;o, it not being the part of a good &s;oldier to inquire after trifles?</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of February we, however, received notice that henceforth we &s;hould pay nothing, provided we could <HI>fa&s;t</HI>; but that if we could not, ten pounds yearly was to be the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of the expences for our &s;alt beef and pork.</P>
<P>On the 2d I received intelligence that Lieutenant Co|lonel Becquer, &s;corning any longer to partake of Four|geoud's bounty, had &s;uddenly given up the gho&s;t, by which in rotation I became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his vacant company. This was &s;ome compen&s;ation for &s;o much trouble and fa|tigue. But to counterbalance this good fortune, a certain lady, who&s;e hu&s;band had &s;hewn me extraordinary civili|ties, now made me an offer, which I could not with honour accept; be&s;ides, I had been &s;worn at Highgate. But per|&s;i&s;ting in my refu&s;al of her favours and golden pre&s;ents, I at la&s;t felt the effects of a woman's hatred and revenge. Her hu&s;band, who had lately been &s;o much my friend, and who&s;e honour I, in this in&s;tance, &s;o much re&s;pected, was &s;uddenly perverted into a bitter enemy. I bore their frowns with re&s;ignation, con&s;cious of my own recti|tude,
<PB N="299" REF="363">
in not committing a tre&s;pa&s;s of which too many others would have made a boa&s;t. Shortly after, how|ever, this gentleman again became my friend, even more than before this affair happened, having been perfectly undeceived.</P>
<P>On the 6th, a poor drummer of the Society brought me a pre&s;ent of &s;ome <HI>alligato,</HI> or more properly <HI>avogato</HI> pears and oranges, for having &s;upported him, he &s;aid, in Holland again&s;t my &s;ervant, who had knocked him down. This trait of gratitude afforded me more plea&s;ure than the coolne&s;s of my late friend had given me pain.&mdash;The avogato pear grows on a tree above forty feet high, and not unlike a walnut-tree: the fruit, which is about the &s;ize and colour of a large pear, <HI>viz.</HI> a pale green, is the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite, in my opinion, of any in the colony, or even in the world; the in&s;ide is yellow, and the kernel is inclo&s;ed in a &s;oft rind like a che&s;nut. The pulp is &s;o &s;alubrious and nutritious, that it is often called the ve|getable marrow, and is frequently eaten with pepper and &s;alt: nor can I compare it to any thing &s;o well as a peach, melting in the mouth in the &s;ame manner, not &s;o &s;weet indeed, but incomparably more delicious.</P>
<P>The oranges in Surinam are of three different &s;pecies; the &s;our, the bitter, and the &s;weet, all being originally imported from Spain or Portugal. The &s;our oranges are an excellent cure for &s;ores and running ulcers, &s;o com|mon in this climate, but painful in the operation; for which rea&s;on they are only u&s;ed for the negroes, who it
<PB N="300" REF="364">
is &s;uppo&s;ed may bear any thing. The bitter are only u&s;ed for pre&s;erving: the &s;weet, which have a lu&s;cious ta&s;te and exqui&s;ite flavour, may be eaten freely, without any pernicious effects, which is not the ca&s;e with that kind called the China apples, which I &s;hall afterwards de&s;cribe. The trees that bear all the&s;e &s;pecies are truly beautiful, and never without fragrant blo&s;&s;oms or fruit throughout the year.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the news arrived that Colonel Fourgeoud, with the remaining troops, having marched from La Rochelle, had been attacked by the rebels; and among&s;t others Captain Fredericy, marching in the front, had been &s;hot through both thighs. This brave officer, clapping both his hands on the wounds, and &s;itting in water up to his brea&s;t to conceal the bleeding, and prevent his misfortune from di&s;couraging the troops, remained in this &s;ituation until the &s;urgeon had dre&s;&s;ed them, when he was carried in his hammock by two negroes.</P>
<P>Nothing, indeed, could exceed the zeal which both this officer, and Fourgeoud's adjutant, Captain Vangew|rike, &s;hewed during the whole expedition; continually upon &s;ervice, whether their con&s;titutions could bear it or not. But honour was the only advantage they derived from a five years a&s;&s;iduous and extraordinary attendance. In my opinion, Colonel Fourgeoud never recompen&s;ed them according to their merit; while he treated the &s;ubalterns, and even &s;ome field officers, wor&s;e than ever I did my corporals.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="365">I now made another offer to join him in the woods; but in&s;tead of permi&s;&s;ion, he &s;ent me orders to ha&s;ten to L'E&s;perance, in Engli&s;h the <HI>Hope</HI> e&s;tate, as I &s;hall hence|forth call it, &s;ituated in the upper part of Rio Comewina, there to take the command of the whole river during his ab&s;ence; which being new to me, I repaired to this po&s;t with the greater &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Having provided my&s;elf with a compleat camp-equi|page, and purcha&s;ed provi&s;ions, I was &s;oon ready to de|part for my new &s;tation. But before I leave Paramaribo, I mu&s;t remark, that during my &s;tay there no le&s;s than nine negroes had each a leg cut off, for running away from their ma&s;ters. This puni&s;hment is a part of the Surinam admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and is performed at the de&s;ire of the proprietor, and was executed by a Mr. Greuber, the &s;urgeon of the ho&s;pital. During this in|human operation, the poor &s;ufferers very deliberately &s;moaked their pipe of tobacco. For this &s;ervice the &s;ur|geon received about &s;ix pounds a limb: but, notwith|&s;tanding his great abilities, four of them died immediate|ly after the operation. A fifth de&s;troyed him&s;elf, by plucking away the bandages and bleeding to death during the night. The&s;e amputated negroes are common in this colony, and are employed in rowing the boats and barges of their ma&s;ters. Others are &s;een deprived of an arm; and this is the forfeit for daring to rai&s;e it again&s;t an European.</P>
<P>I embarked on the 17th of February for the Hope, in
<PB N="302" REF="366">
the river Comewina, on board a decent tent-boat rowed by &s;ix negroes, having once more bid adieu to my be|loved Joanna. In the evening I pa&s;&s;ed the Spork&s;gift e&s;tate, in the Matapica Creek; the next day I arrived at Arentru&s;t in Comewina, having pa&s;&s;ed the Orelana Creek and the fortre&s;s Somel&s;dyk, which is about &s;ixteen miles above Fort Am&s;terdam, and forms the &s;eparation between that and the river Cottica, commanding the two oppo&s;ite &s;hores by the fire of its cannon. This fortre&s;s was built in the year 1684 by Governor Somel&s;dyk, who&s;e name it &s;till bears. It is built in the form of a pentagon, having five ba&s;tions mounted with artillery; it has a fo&s;&s;e, and is well provided with military &s;tores: though it is not large, it is well defended, e&s;pecially by its low and mar&s;hy &s;ituation. Not far above this, to the right, is a fine creek, called Comete-Wana.</P>
<P>On the 19th, about noon, I reached the Hope; having found this river &s;till more charming than the river Cot|tica, both being bordered with beautiful e&s;tates of coffee and &s;ugar, the fir&s;t of which abounds principally near its mouth. About half way up both the&s;e rivers are al&s;o in each a Prote&s;tant church, where the plantation people re&s;ort to hear divine wor&s;hip: the expence of the par|&s;on, &amp;c. being paid by the planters.</P>
<P>The e&s;tate L'E&s;perance, or the Hope, where I now took the command, is a valuable &s;ugar-plantation, &s;ituated on the left &s;ide of the Comewina, at the mouth of a rivulet called Bottle Creek, and almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to another creek
<PB N="303" REF="367">
called Ca&s;&s;ivinica: the Bottle Creek communicating with the Comewina and Pirica, as the Wana Creek does with Cormoetibo and Rio-Comewina.</P>
<P>Here the troops were lodged in temporary hou&s;es built with the manicole-tree; but the &s;ituation was &s;o low and mar&s;hy as at &s;pring-tides to be entirely under water. The officers were all crowded in one apartment of the &s;ame con&s;truction; while the planter's fine hou&s;e, which might have been &s;erviceable for the plea&s;ure and health of the&s;e gentlemen, was made u&s;e of by nobody but the over&s;eer of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>About a cannon-&s;hot higher up the river is the e&s;tate Clarenbeek; where I went, on the 22d, to examine the &s;tate of the ho&s;pital, and where I found the troops more di&s;agreeably quartered than at the Hope, owing chiefly to the amazing number of rats with which this place was infe&s;ted, de&s;troying the men's clothes and provi&s;ions, and running over their faces by dozens as they lay in their hammocks. The only mode of remedying this horrid inconvenience, was to break holes in the bottoms of quart bottles, and then &s;tring them like beads upon the la&s;hings of each hammock, both at head and foot: when this was properly done, their poli&s;h rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for the rats to reach the canvas.</P>
<P>Here the crowded ho&s;pital afforded a melancholy &s;pec|tacle, by the mi&s;erable objects it pre&s;ented. Humanity &s;uffers &s;o much from &s;uch &s;cenes, that I felt my&s;elf happy upon my return to the Hope. My orders here were
<PB N="304" REF="368">
much the &s;ame as they had been at Cottica, <HI>viz.</HI> to pro|tect the e&s;tates from the enemy: the parole or watch-word was regularly &s;ent me by Colonel Fourgeoud. One of the Berbice negro captains, before mentioned, named <HI>Ackeraw,</HI> here di&s;covered an old decrepid &s;lave called Paulus, belonging to this e&s;tate, to be his brother. He acknowledged him with cordial affection, and treated him with much kindne&s;s: the &s;cene of their meeting was of cour&s;e very intere&s;ting. In my walks round this planta|tion, I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving &s;everal curious birds, which I &s;hall now embrace the opportunity to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The <HI>quee&s;e-queedee,</HI> &s;o called on account of its note, is about the &s;ize of a thru&s;h, and of a brown colour, except the brea&s;t and belly, which are of a beautiful yellow: it is very mi&s;chievous, and an unwelcome gue&s;t upon the plantations. The wild pigeons are al&s;o common here. I &s;hot one that was very large, and re&s;embling what is called the ring-tail pigeon of Jamaica. Its back and &s;ides were of an a&s;h colour; the tail a lead colour; the belly white; the neck reflecting a changeable green and purple; the iris and feet of this pigeon were red. I have al&s;o &s;een the dwarf pigeons here walking in pairs. They are about the &s;ize of an Engli&s;h &s;parrow, and rather of a lighter colour. I take the&s;e to be the <HI>picui-nima</HI> of Marcgrave. The eyes were bright, with a yellow iris, and upon the whole the&s;e diminutive creatures are very pretty. They are called <HI>&s;teen-duyfie</HI> by the Dutch, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="305" REF="369">
they are frequently found among&s;t &s;tones and gravel. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bancroft erroneou&s;ly calls this bird the only dove in Guiana.</NOTE> Turtles are al&s;o found in Guiana, but &s;eldom near the plantations, as they delight chiefly in the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t. They build their ne&s;ts in trees of the thicke&s;t foliage, where I have found them, and even &s;troked them with my hand, without their attempt|ing to fly away. They are little different from tho&s;e in Europe in point of colour, but rather le&s;s, and their wings of a more con&s;iderable length than tho&s;e of any other dove or pigeon whatever.</P>
<P>I became daily more charmed with my &s;ituation; I was at liberty to breathe freely, and my pro&s;pects of future contentment promi&s;ed amply to compen&s;ate for my pa&s;t hard&s;hips and mortifications. Re&s;pected as the prince of the river; care&s;&s;ed by the neighbouring planters, who plentifully &s;upplied me with pre&s;ents of game, fi&s;h, fruit, and vegetables, I was &s;carcely the &s;ame man, and had very few wi&s;hes un&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>One day (the 5th of March) during my re&s;idence here, I was &s;urpri&s;ed by the waving of a white handkerchief from a tent-boat that was rowing up the river; when, to augment my happine&s;s, it unexpectedly proved to be my Mulatto, accompanied by her aunt, who now pre|ferred Fauconberg e&s;tate, four miles above the Hope, to re&s;iding in the town; and to this plantation I immedi|ately accompanied them.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="370">Here Joanna introduced me to a venerable old &s;lave, her grandfather, who made me a pre&s;ent of half a dozen fowls.

He told me he was born in Africa, where he had once been more re&s;pected than any of his Surinam ma&s;ters ever were in their country.</P>
<P>It will no doubt appear &s;urpri&s;ing to many of my readers to find me mention this female &s;lave &s;o often, and with &s;o much re&s;pect; but I cannot &s;peak with indif|ference of an object &s;o de&s;erving of attention, and who&s;e affectionate attachment alone counter-balanced all my other misfortunes.

<P>On the 6th of March I returned to the Hope, loaded with fowls, aubergines, brocoli, agoma, and a few Su|rinam cherries. The aubergines are a &s;pecies of fruit which grows in the &s;hape of a cucumber; they are of a purple colour without, and white within; they are cut in &s;lices and eaten like &s;allad, &s;ometimes &s;tewed: they are very good and whole&s;ome. The leaves of the tree which bears this fruit are large and green, covered with a purple-coloured down. The agoma is a bitteri&s;h ve|getable: the brocoli as in Europe, but &s;carce. The cher|ries are ribbed, very &s;our, and unle&s;s very ripe fit only for pre&s;erving.</P>
<P>On the prince of Orange's anniver&s;ary, the 8th of March, I invited &s;ome company to drink his health,
<PB N="308" REF="372">
whil&s;t Colonel Fourgeoud kept &s;couring the bu&s;hes; but the &s;um of his operations amounted only to having &s;ome of his men &s;hot by the negroes, &s;ome lo&s;t in the woods; whil&s;t the rebel Cupido e&s;caped with all his chains. Of two men he &s;ent me for the ho&s;pital at Clarenbeek, one was terribly cut by the rebels.</P>
<P>I received a pre&s;ent of a haunch of veni&s;on on the 17th from a Mr. D'Onis; and one of my &s;laves pre&s;ented me with a lizard called <HI>&s;apagala,</HI> which is le&s;s in &s;ize and le&s;s agreeable food than the iguana, which I have already de&s;cribed, and which the Indians call <HI>wayamaka.</HI> Of this la&s;t dainty I did not partake, but gave it to the over&s;eer, while with the veni&s;on I entertained all my of|ficers.</P>
<P>Of the deer &s;pecies there are two kinds; the &s;tag or large&s;t, called the <HI>bajew,</HI> is about the &s;ize of the Engli&s;h roebuck, with &s;hort curvated horns; the eyes are bright, and full of fire; the tail &s;hort; the hair a reddi&s;h brown, except the belly, which is white. The&s;e ani|mals, when pur&s;ued, run with amazing &s;trength and ve|locity. They are frequently &s;een near the plantations, where they commit great deva&s;tations among the &s;ugar|canes; they are often &s;hot by the negro or Indian hunt&s;|men, which the planters keep on purpo&s;e. Hunting is impracticable as a &s;port to Europeans in this country, owing to the thickne&s;s of the woods. The deer are &s;ometimes taken alive in cro&s;&s;ing rivers, which they of|ten

take to when over-heated, or to e&s;cape their enemies. The fle&s;h of this &s;tag is neither fat, tender, nor juicy, being much inferior to the European veni&s;on, though greatly e&s;teemed by the inhabitants of Surinam. The other &s;pecies the negroes call <HI>boo&s;ee-cabritta</HI>; the Indians <HI>wirrebocerra.</HI> The&s;e are much &s;maller, and more nimble in e&s;caping; their colour a yellowi&s;h brown, covered with &s;mall white &s;pots; their eyes lively and piercing; their ears narrow and &s;hort; they have no antlers; their limbs are &s;mall, but nervous and &s;trong; and their fle&s;h more delicate than any other veni&s;on I ever ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, having vi&s;ited Mr. and Mrs. Lolkens at Fauconberg, we, after dinner, walked to a brick-ma|nufactory, called <HI>Appe-cappe,</HI> which lies in the neigh|bourhood, and belongs to Governor Nepveu; where they make as good brick, and as expeditiou&s;ly, as in Europe. It is al&s;o a profitable bu&s;ine&s;s, not being common in Surinam. This I only relate as a proof of the abundant advantages of this country; where, moreover, the wood for burning the bricks may be had for cutting, if the inhabitants chu&s;e to be indu&s;trious. We were here, how|ever, &s;o pe&s;tered with clouds of in&s;ects, called <HI>monpeira,</HI> that I was glad to take my leave, and return to the Hope. The monpeira are the &s;malle&s;t kind of gnats, but equally trouble&s;ome with the larger &s;pecies called mu&s;quitoes. They fly &s;o thick and clo&s;e together, that they appear like a cloud of black &s;moke: they are &s;o &s;mall that
<PB N="310" REF="375">
numbers of them &s;tick in the eyes, whence they cannot be extracted without pain, and even danger.</P>
<P>I always vi&s;ited by water, having at the Hope an ele|gant tent-boat, with half a dozen negroes at my com|mand, who al&s;o &s;hot and fi&s;hed for me. Upon the whole, I was here &s;o happy and &s;o much re&s;pected, that I could almo&s;t have engaged never more to change my &s;ituation.</P>

<P>I HAVE already &s;aid that I was happy at the Hope;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP.

</LETTER>
<P>This letter was accompanied by another from my friend Lolkens, who much cheared my pro&s;pects by the a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched the&s;e letters to Holland, I had now the opportunity of ob&s;erving the whole proce&s;s of a &s;u|gar-plantation; of which I &s;hall endeavour to give an ac|curate de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The buildings u&s;ually con&s;i&s;t of an elegant dwelling-hou&s;e for the planter, outhou&s;es for the over&s;eer and book-keeper, be&s;ides a carpenter's lodge, kitchens, &s;tore-hou&s;es, and &s;tables, if the &s;ugar-mills be wrought by hor&s;es or mules; but on the Hope the&s;e are not requi|&s;ite, as the wheels move by water, &s;tored in canals during the &s;pring-tide by means of &s;luices, which being open|ed at low water pour out like a deluge, and &s;et the ma|chinery in motion. A &s;ugar-mill is built at the expence
<PB N="313" REF="378">
of four thou&s;and, nay &s;ometimes &s;even or eight thou|&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>A particular de&s;cription of its con&s;truction might be too tedious. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the large water-wheel moves perpendicularly, and corre&s;ponds with an|other large wheel placed in an horizontal direction, and this again acts upon three cylinders or rollers of ca&s;t-iron, &s;upported underneath by a &s;trong beam, &s;o clo&s;e together that when the whole is in motion, they draw in and &s;queeze as thin as paper whatever comes between them. In this manner the &s;ugar-cane is brui&s;ed, to &s;epa|rate the juice or liquor from the tra&s;h.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e mills that are wrought by cattle are con&s;tructed upon the &s;ame principles, only the hor&s;es or mules an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the horizontal wheel, by dragging round a large lever. If the water-mills work the fa&s;te&s;t, and be the cheape&s;t, yet as they mu&s;t wait for the tides, they can only work part of the day; whereas the cattle-mills are always ready whenever the proprietor finds it convenient to u&s;e them. Adjoining to the mill-hou&s;e is a large apartment, al&s;o built of brick, in which are fixed the coppers or large cauldrons to boil the liquid &s;ugar. The&s;e are u&s;ually five in number; oppo&s;ite to the&s;e are the coolers, which are large &s;quare flat-bottomed wooden ve&s;&s;els, into which the &s;ugar is put from the cauldrons to cool before it is put into hog&s;heads, which are placed near the coolers upon &s;trong channeled rafters, that re|ceive
<PB N="314" REF="379">
the mela&s;&s;es as it drops from the &s;ugar, and convey it into a &s;quare ci&s;tern placed underneath to receive it. The di&s;tillery joins this apartment, where the dro&s;s or &s;cum of the boiling &s;ugar is converted into a kind of rum, mentioned before, and known by the name of <HI>kill-devil.</HI> Every e&s;tate in Surinam keeps a tent-boat and &s;everal other craft, for the conveyance of their produce; they have al&s;o a covered dock, to keep them dry and re|pair them.</P>
<P>The &s;ugar e&s;tates in this colony contain five or &s;ix hundred acres; the parts for cultivation being divided into &s;quares, where pieces of cane, about one foot long, are &s;tuck into the ground in an oblique po&s;ition, in rows &s;traight and parallel. They u&s;ually plant them in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, when the earth is well &s;oaked and rich. The &s;hoots that &s;pring from the&s;e joints are about twelve or &s;ixteen months in arriving at maturity, when they become yellow, and of the thickne&s;s of a German flute, and from &s;ix to ten feet in height, and jointed, forming a very beautiful appearance, with pale green leaves like tho&s;e of a leek, but longer and denticulated, and which hang down as the crop becomes ready for cutting. The principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;laves during the growth of the canes is pulling up the weeds, which would otherwi&s;e impoveri&s;h them.</P>
<P>Some &s;ugar e&s;tates have above four hundred &s;laves. The expence of purcha&s;ing the&s;e, and erecting the build|ings,
<PB REF="380">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>The Sugar Cane, in its four different Stages.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="315" REF="381">
frequently amounts to twenty or five-and-twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, exclu&s;ive of the value of the ground.</P>
<P>But to give the reader a clearer idea of the &s;ugar-cane, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a native of Guiana, I refer him to the annexed plate, where he may view it in the dif|ferent &s;tages, though on a &s;maller &s;cale than nature; <HI>A</HI> being its fir&s;t appearance above the ground; <HI>B</HI> the cane come to half maturity; <HI>C</HI> the &s;ame with drooping leaves, when fully ripe; <HI>D</HI> a piece cut off at one end, and broken off at the other.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now examine its progre&s;s through the mill: here it is brui&s;ed between the three cylinders or rollers through which it pa&s;&s;es twice, once it enters, and once it returns, when it is changed to tra&s;h, and its pithy &s;ub&s;tance into liquid, which is conducted as extracted, through a grooved beam, from the mill to the boiling-hou&s;e, where it is received into a kind of wooden ci&s;tern.</P>
<P>So very dangerous is the work of tho&s;e negroes who attend the rollers, that &s;hould one of their fingers be caught between them, which frequently happens through inadvertency, the whole arm is in&s;tantly &s;hattered to pieces, if not part of the body. A hatchet is generally kept ready to chop off the limb, before the working of the mill can be &s;topped. Another danger is, that &s;hould a poor &s;lave dare to ta&s;te that &s;ugar which he produces by the &s;weat of his brow, he runs the ri&s;k of receiving
<PB N="316" REF="382">
&s;ome hundred la&s;hes, or having all his teeth knocked out by the over&s;eer.&mdash;Such are the hard&s;hips and dangers to which the &s;ugar-making negroes are expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>From the above wooden ci&s;tern the liquor is let into the fir&s;t copper cauldron, filtering through a grating to keep back the tra&s;h that may have e&s;caped from the mill; here, having boiled &s;ome time, and been &s;cummed, it is put into the next cauldron, and &s;o on till in the fifth or la&s;t it is brought to a proper thickne&s;s or con&s;i&s;tency to be admitted into the coolers: a few pounds of lime and allum are thrown into the cauldrons to make it gra|nulate; thus it is boiled gradually &s;tronger and &s;tronger, until it reaches the la&s;t cauldron. When it is put into the wooden coolers the &s;ugar is well &s;tirred, and &s;cattered equally throughout the ve&s;&s;els; when cold it has a frozen appearance, being candied, of a brown glazed con&s;i&s;t|ency, not unlike pieces of high poli&s;hed walnut-tree. From the coolers it is put into the hog&s;heads, which, upon an average, will hold one thou&s;and pounds weight of &s;ugar; there it &s;ettles, and through the crevices and &s;mall holes made in the bottoms it is purged of all its liquid contents, which are called mela&s;&s;es, and, as I have &s;aid, are received in an under-ground ci&s;tern. This is the la&s;t operation, after which the &s;ugar is fit for expor|tation to Europe, where it is refined and ca&s;t into loaves. I &s;hall only farther ob&s;erve, that the larger the grain the better the &s;ugar, and that no &s;oil can be more proper for its cultivation than Guiana, the richne&s;s of which is in|exhau&s;tible,
<PB N="317" REF="383">
and produces upon an average three or four hog&s;heads <HI>per</HI> acre. In 1771, no le&s;s than twenty-four thou&s;and hog&s;heads were exported to Am&s;terdam and Rotterdam only, which, valued at &s;ix pounds <HI>per</HI> hog&s;|head, though it has &s;ometimes &s;old for double, returned a &s;um of near one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, be&s;ides the va&s;t quantity of mela&s;&s;es and kill-devil; the fir&s;t computed at &s;even thou&s;and hog&s;heads, and &s;old to the North Americans for twenty-five thou|&s;and pounds; the &s;econd, which is di&s;tilled in Surinam, and u&s;ed chiefly by the negroes, valued at as much more, which produces no le&s;s than two hundred thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t &s;ugar was refined anno 1659.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The kill-devil is al&s;o drank by &s;ome of the planters, but too much by the common &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, and, when new, acts as a &s;low pernicious poi&s;on upon an Eu|ropean con&s;titution. On the contrary, it never hurts the negroes, but is even nece&s;&s;ary and whole&s;ome, e&s;pecially in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, when they are &s;ometimes indulged with a &s;ingle dram <HI>per</HI> day by their ma&s;ters, though this cu&s;tom is far from being general. There is no part of this &s;alutary plant u&s;ele&s;s; the chaff refu&s;e, and leaves of the cane, being u&s;ed for manure and fuel. All the e&s;tates are clo&s;ely &s;urrounded by the uncultivated fo|re&s;t, whence the herds of wild deer often commit very great ravages, when the pieces being &s;urrounded by
<PB N="318" REF="384">
armed negroes, and dogs &s;et in to di&s;per&s;e them, they are frequently &s;hot. From what I have &s;aid upon this &s;ub|ject alone, the reader may form an idea of the riches with which this country abounds; which, neverthele&s;s, did not &s;eem to &s;timulate its enemies during the late war to attempt the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: but I mu&s;t &s;ay, I doubt whether Surinam, in the hands of any other nation than the Dutch, would not cea&s;e to be of its pre&s;ent con&s;e|quence, the Hollanders being indi&s;putably the mo&s;t pa|tient, per&s;evering, indu&s;trious people that inhabit the globe.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, however, the immen&s;e wealth that the We&s;t Indies in general afford, it will ever be my opi|nion that the Europeans might live as comfortably, if not more healthily, without them; the want of &s;ugar, coffee, cotton, cacao, indigo, rum, and Brazil wood, might be amply &s;upplied by honey, milk, wool, Geneva, ale, Eng|li&s;h herbs, Briti&s;h oak, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now once more to re&s;ume my narrative:&mdash;I have already mentioned that my &s;laves were employed in pre|paring an hou&s;e for the reception of my be&s;t friend, which was about &s;ix days in completing. It con&s;i&s;ted of a par|lour, which al&s;o &s;erved for a dining-room; a bed-chamber, where I al&s;o &s;towed my baggage; a piazza or &s;hed to &s;it under before the door; a &s;mall kitchen detached from the hou&s;e, and a poultry-hou&s;e, the whole &s;ituated on a &s;pot by it&s;elf, commanding an enchanting pro&s;pect on every &s;ide, and &s;urrounded with paling to keep off the
<PB N="319" REF="385">
cattle. My tables, &s;tools, and benches, being all compo&s;ed of manicole boards, the doors and windows were guarded with ingenious wooden locks and keys, that were pre|&s;ented me by a negro, and were the work of his own hands. My hou&s;e being thus far fini&s;hed and furni&s;h|ed, my next care was to lay in a &s;tock of provi&s;ions from Paramaribo, <HI>viz.</HI> a barrel of flour, another of &s;alted mackarel, which in this country are delicious, they are imported from North America; hams, pickled &s;au&s;ages, Bo&s;ton bi&s;cuit; al&s;o wine, Jamaica rum, tea, &s;ugar, a box of &s;permaceti candles; al&s;o two charming foreign &s;heep and a hog, &s;ent me by Mr. Kennedy from his e&s;tate Vrie|dyk, be&s;ides two dozen of fine fowls and ducks pre&s;ented me by Lucretia, my Joanna's aunt; while fruit, vegeta|bles, fi&s;h, and veni&s;on, flowed upon me from every quar|ter as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of April 1774, Joanna came down the river in the Fauconberg tent-boat, rowed by eight negroes, and arrived at the Hope: I communicated to her imme|diately the contents of my letter to Holland, which &s;he received with that gratitude and mode&s;ty in her looks which &s;poke more forcibly than any reply. I introduced her to her new habitation, where the plantation &s;laves, in token of re&s;pect, immediately brought her pre&s;ents of ca|&s;ada, yams, bananas, and plantains, and never two people were more completely happy. Free like the roes in the fore&s;t, and di&s;encumbered of every care and ceremony, we breathed the pure&s;t ether in our walks, and refre&s;hed
<PB N="320" REF="386">
our limbs in the limpid &s;tream: health and good &s;pirits were now again my portion, while my partner flouri&s;hed in youth and beauty, the envy and admiration of all the colony.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud now intending to quit the woods, and encamp at Magdenberg, a po&s;t near the &s;ource of the Comewina, I &s;ent a large barge with provi&s;ions, e&s;|corted by an officer and twenty men, to that place; and upon reviewing my remaining marines, they did not amount to twenty men, be&s;ides a &s;mall detachment at Calis, near the mouth of Ca&s;&s;ivinica Creek. Higher up the &s;ame creek, at an e&s;tate called <HI>Cupy,</HI> were al&s;o po&s;ted an officer and a few &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 4th, I was witne&s;s to a very wonderful battle between two &s;nakes, the one about three feet long, the other no more than fourteen inches; when, after a &s;evere conte&s;t of near half an hour, during which time the many wreathings and twi&s;tings were truly curious, the large&s;t gradually &s;hifting his gripe, at length caught the &s;malle&s;t by the head, and ab&s;olutely &s;wallowed him alive.</P>
<P>My negro boy about this time throwing out &s;ome red-hot embers, I was &s;urprized to &s;ee the frogs eat them with avidity, without receiving any vi&s;ible damage from the fire, which mo&s;t probably they had mi&s;taken for the fire-fly. I &s;aw another frog in the &s;ugar-mill, fea&s;ting upon a regiment of ants, which are here very numerous, licking them up with his tongue as they marched be|fore

him. Another of the&s;e animals &s;lept every day upon one of the beams of my cottage, which it regularly left every night; this was called <HI>yombo-yombo</HI> by the ne|groes, from its great power in leaping: it is very &s;mall, almo&s;t flat, a fine yellow, with black and &s;carlet &s;pecks: it is frequently found in the upper &s;tories of hou&s;es, where it arrives by climbing up the walls. We thought it a pretty little animal, and would allow nobody to hurt it.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 8th, between &s;ix and &s;even o'clock, whil&s;t we were interring one of my &s;erjeants, we heard the report of &s;everal minute guns towards the river Pirica; in con&s;equence of which, I immediately detached an officer and twelve men to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They returned next day with an account that the rebels had attacked the e&s;tate of <HI>Kortenduur,</HI> where, having pillaged &s;ome powder, the plantation &s;laves being armed by their ma&s;ter, had bravely beaten them back before my a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be of u&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;mall detachment from Colonel Fourgeoud at Wana Creek arrived at the Hope on the 11th, with <HI>September,</HI> the negro pri&s;oner, who related that the rebels had &s;poken to Fourgeoud, and even laughed at him, having over|heard him giving his orders, <HI>viz.</HI> not to fire on them, but to take them alive: and that among&s;t tho&s;e lo&s;t in the woods was the unlucky <HI>Schmidt,</HI> who had lately been &s;o unmercifully beaten, and of which he had never yet recovered.</P>
<P>About the 13th, the &s;pring floods broke down the
<PB N="322" REF="388">
dams, and laid our whole po&s;t under water, except the &s;pot where I had pitched my cabin, which remained dry, but unfortunately by this accident the officers and men were up to the knees in water. My worthy friend Mr. <HI>Heneman,</HI> the volunteer, arrived at this time from Colonel Fourgeoud's camp at Wana Creek, with a barge full of men and ammunition; he was now entered a lieu|tenant in my company: he informed us, that the re|maining troops were marching for Magdenberg in Upper Comewina, there to go into quarters. This poor young man was much emaciated with mi&s;ery and fatigue, I therefore introduced him at his fir&s;t landing to the care of <HI>Joanna,</HI> who was a mo&s;t incomparable nur&s;e, and under who&s;e care he felt him&s;elf extremely happy.</P>
<P>On the 14th, Colonel Fourgeoud with his troops being arrived at Magdenberg, the officers and privates of the Society, and the rangers to the amount of near two hun|dred men, were &s;ent down in barges to be &s;tationed on different parts of the river Pirica. Some landed at the Hope to refre&s;h, and behaved &s;o very di&s;orderly, as to ob|lige me and my officers to knock them down by half do|zens, to keep the peace till they departed the &s;ame day, after which I di&s;patched a tent-boat and eight oars to row the commander in chief with &s;ome of his favourites to Paramaribo, from which place he at la&s;t permitted the much-injured <HI>Count Rantwick</HI> to &s;ail for Holland.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the greate&s;t part of the &s;heep belonging to this e&s;tate were unfortunately poi&s;oned by eating <HI>duncane,</HI> but mine, among&s;t &s;ome others, luckily e&s;caped.
<PB N="323" REF="389">
I am &s;orry to &s;ay I have not particularly examined the duncane, as it is called by the negroes. All that I can &s;ay is, that it is a &s;hrub with a large green leaf, &s;ome|thing like that of the Engli&s;h dock; it grows &s;ponta|neou&s;ly in low and mar&s;hy places, and is in&s;tant death to whatever animal eats of its leaves; the &s;laves therefore &s;hould be obliged carefully to root it out from the gra&s;s &s;avannas or meadows where cattle graze, &s;ince &s;heep and bullocks are &s;aid to be remarkably fond of it, though contrary to nature, as mo&s;t animals know, it is &s;aid, in|&s;tinctively how to di&s;tingui&s;h their food from their poi&s;on. But the &s;heep in que&s;tion not being the natural inhabi|tants of Guiana, may for that rea&s;on be admitted as an exception to this general rule. This baneful plant had inadvertently been permitted to grow in a negro's gar|den, to which the &s;heep got acce&s;s by breaking down the fence, which occa&s;ioned this unplea&s;ant cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>In this garden I &s;aw &s;everal other roots and plants that de&s;erve to be noticed. The <HI>yame&s;y,</HI> or yam, a well-known root in the We&s;t Indies, delights in a fat &s;oil; this grows in Surinam &s;ometimes to the weight of two or three &s;core pounds, and an acre will produce an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes from ten to twenty thou&s;and pounds weight.</NOTE>; its ta&s;te is very agreeable, either boiled or roa&s;ted, ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and very whole&s;ome. The in&s;ide is of a whiti&s;h colour, without it is of a deep pur|ple approaching towards black; its &s;hape is very irre|gular.
<PB N="324" REF="390">
The yams are cultivated by cutting them in pieces like potatoes; they are planted a few feet di&s;tant from each other, and in about &s;ix or eight months they arrive at maturity; they are known to be fit for u&s;e when the top or leaves begin to lo&s;e their verdure, till then they are of a deep green colour, and creep along the ground like ivy, with ligneous &s;hoots. The yam is among&s;t the principal food of the &s;laves throughout the We&s;t Indies, and is alone &s;ufficient to &s;upply the want of bread; al&s;o being capable of pre&s;ervation for almo&s;t a year, it is often tran&s;ported, and u&s;ed upon long voyages, and frequently brought to England. Another &s;mall root I found here, known in Surinam by the name of <HI>naapjes,</HI> and which is eaten in the &s;ame manner as the yams, but is infinitely more delicious; both the one and the other &s;erve here for food, as potatoes, carrots, or par&s;nips do in England.</P>
<P>The <HI>maize</HI> or Indian corn, which I al&s;o &s;aw in this gar|den, grows on high perpendicular &s;talks, with long pale green leaves; the grain is of a &s;hining yellow colour, as large as marrow-peas, and clo&s;ely &s;et together, round ears that are the &s;ize of the large&s;t European carrot. This grain is cultivated in great quantities in Surinam; it is not only u&s;ed for their poultry and cattle of every &s;pecies, but is al&s;o ground into meal, of which the Creoles make ex|cellent puddings and cakes, which are of a nouri&s;hing quality. With this they &s;ometimes eat the young pods of the <HI>ocro,</HI> or <HI>althea plant,</HI> which grows upon a very &s;mall
<PB N="325" REF="391">
&s;hrub, with oblong leaves, and which when boiled, as Dr. Bancroft expre&s;&s;es it, are of a mucilaginous, &s;limy, and lubricative texture, which ropy or glutinous quality, however di&s;gu&s;ting in appearance, makes a very rich &s;auce when properly &s;ea&s;oned with Cayenne pepper.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening that proved &s;o fatal to the &s;heep, as I was walking out with my gun, as u&s;ual, I &s;hot a bird called here the <HI>&s;ubacoo</HI>; it is a &s;pecies of the grey-heron, its bill and legs of a greeni&s;h black, and very long, the la&s;t appearing as if jointed by large &s;cales of a hard and horny &s;ub&s;tance, and the claws on each middle toe are denticulated. This bird, though apparently the &s;ize of a common fowl, was &s;o very light, that an Engli&s;h hou&s;e-pigeon would have ea&s;ily counterbalanced it; when dre&s;&s;ed we found it to have a fi&s;hy flavour.</P>
<P>I have for &s;ome time been happily &s;ilent upon the &s;ubject of cruelty; and &s;orry I am, at a time when all ap|peared harmonious and peaceable, to be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of relating &s;ome in&s;tances, which I am confident mu&s;t in&s;pire the mo&s;t unfeeling reader with horror and re&s;entment. The fir&s;t object which attracted my com|pa&s;&s;ion during a vi&s;it to a neighbouring e&s;tate, was a beautiful Samboe girl of about eighteen, tied up by both arms to a tree, as naked as &s;he came into the world, and lacerated in &s;uch a &s;hocking manner by the whips of two negro-drivers, that &s;he was from her neck to her ancles literally dyed over with blood. It was after &s;he had re|ceived two hundred la&s;hes that I perceived her, with her
<PB N="326" REF="392">
head hanging downwards, a mo&s;t affecting &s;pectacle. When, turning to the over&s;eer, I implored that &s;he might be immediately unbound, &s;ince &s;he had undergone the whole of &s;o &s;evere a puni&s;hment; but the &s;hort an&s;wer which I obtained was, that to prevent all &s;trangers from interfering with his government, he had made an unal|terable rule, in that ca&s;e, always to double the puni&s;h|ment, which he in&s;tantaneou&s;ly began to put in execu|tion: I endeavoured to &s;top him, but in vain, he declar|ing the delay &s;hould not alter his determination, but make him take vengeance with double intere&s;t. Thus I had no other remedy but to run to my boat, and leave the dete&s;table mon&s;ter, like a bea&s;t of prey, to enjoy his bloody fea&s;t, till he was glutted. From that day I de|termined to break off all communication with over&s;eers, and could not refrain from bitter imprecations again&s;t the whole relentle&s;s fraternity. Upon inve&s;tigating the cau&s;e of this matchle&s;s barbarity, I was credibly inform|ed, that her only crime con&s;i&s;ted in firmly refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to the loath&s;ome embraces of her dete&s;table exe|cutioner. Prompted by his jealou&s;y and revenge, he called this the puni&s;hment of di&s;obedience, and &s;he was thus flead alive. Not having hitherto introduced the Samboe ca&s;t, I take this opportunity, by here repre&s;ent|ing the mi&s;erable young woman as I found her to the attention of the &s;ympathizing reader.</P>
<P>A Samboe is between a mulatto and a black, being of a deep copper-coloured complexion, with dark hair, that
<PB REF="393">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="327" REF="394">
curls in large ringlets. The&s;e &s;laves, both male and fe|male, are generally hand&s;ome, and chiefly employed as menial &s;ervants in the planters' hou&s;es.</P>
<P>At my return to the Hope, I was acco&s;ted by Mr. Ebber, the over&s;eer of that e&s;tate, who with a woeful countenance informed me he had ju&s;t been fined in the &s;um of twelve hundred florins, about one hundred guineas, for having exerci&s;ed the like cruelty on a male &s;lave; with this difference, that the victim had died dur|ing the execution. In an&s;wer to his complaint, &s;o far from giving him con&s;olation, I told him his di&s;tre&s;s gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The particulars of this murder were as follow: during the time that Captain Tulling commanded here, which was a little time before I came to the Hope, it happened that a fugitive negro belonging to this e&s;tate had been taken upon an adjoining plantation, and &s;ent home, guard|ed by two armed &s;laves, to Mr. Ebber; which fugitive, during the time Ebber was reading the letter that accom|panied him, found means to &s;pring a&s;ide, and again e&s;caped into the fore&s;t. This incen&s;ed the over&s;eer &s;o much, that he in&s;tantly took revenge upon the two poor &s;laves that had brought him, tying them up in the car|penter's lodge. He continued flogging them &s;o unmer|cifully, that Captain Tulling thought proper to interfere, and beg for mercy; but, as in my ca&s;e, his interference produced the oppo&s;ite effect: the clang of the whip, mixed with their di&s;mal cries, were heard to continue
<PB N="328" REF="395">
for above an hour after, until one of them expired under the cruel la&s;h, which put an end to the inhuman ca|ta&s;trophe. A law-&s;uit was in&s;tantly commenced again&s;t Ebber for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. He was convicted, but condemn|ed to no other puni&s;hment than to pay the afore-mentioned hundred guineas, which <HI>price of blood</HI> is always divided between the fi&s;cal and the proprietor of the decea&s;ed &s;lave; it being a rule in Surinam, that by paying a fine of five hundred florins, not quite fifty pounds <HI>per</HI> head, any proprietor is at liberty to kill as many of his own negroes as he plea&s;es; but if he kills tho&s;e of his neigh|bour, he is al&s;o to pay him for the lo&s;s of his &s;lave, the crime being fir&s;t &s;ub&s;tantiated, which is very difficult in this country, where no &s;lave's evidence can be admitted. Such is the legi&s;lature of Dutch Guiana, in regard to negroes. The above-mentioned Ebber was peculiarly tyrannical; he tormented a boy of about fourteen called <HI>Cadetty,</HI> for the &s;pace of a whole year, by flogging him every day for one month; tying him down flat on his back, with his feet in the &s;tocks, for another; putting an iron triangle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e triangles have three long barbed &s;pikes, like &s;mall grapplings, projecting from an iron collar.</NOTE> or pot-hook round his neck for a third, which prevented him from running away among the woods, or even from &s;leeping, except in an upright or &s;itting po&s;ture; chaining him to the landing-place, night and day, to a dog's kennel, with orders to bark at every boat or canoe that pa&s;&s;ed for a fourth month; and &s;o
<PB N="329" REF="396">
on, varying his puni&s;hment monthly, until the youth became in&s;en&s;ible, walking crooked, and almo&s;t de|generated into a brute. This wretch was, however, very proud of his hand&s;ome&s;t &s;laves, and for fear of di&s;|figuring their &s;kins, he has &s;ometimes let them off with twenty la&s;hes, when, for their robberies and crimes, they had de&s;erved the gallows. Such is the &s;tate of public and private ju&s;tice in Surinam. The wretch Ebber left the Hope upon this occa&s;ion; and his <HI>humane</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;or, a Mr. Blenderman, commenced his reign by flogging every &s;lave belonging to the e&s;tate, male and female, for hav|ing over-&s;lept their time in the morning about fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>The reader will, no doubt, imagine, that &s;uch cruel|ties were unparalleled; but this is not the ca&s;e, they were even exceeded, and by a female too.</P>
<P>A Mrs. S&mdash;Ik&mdash;r going to her e&s;tate in a tent-barge, a negro woman, with her &s;ucking infant, happened to be pa&s;&s;engers, and were &s;eated on the bow or fore-part of the boat. The child crying, from pain perhaps, or &s;ome other rea&s;on, could not be hu&s;hed; Mrs. S&mdash;Ik&mdash;r, offended with the cries of this innocent little creature, ordered the mother to bring it aft, and deliver it into her hands; then, in the pre&s;ence of the di&s;tracted parent, &s;he imme|diately thru&s;t it out at one of the tilt-windows, where &s;he held it under water until it was drowned, and then let it go. The fond mother, in a &s;tate of de&s;peration,
<PB N="330" REF="397">
in&s;tantly leapt overboard into the &s;tream, where floated her beloved offspring, in conjunction with which &s;he was determined to fini&s;h her mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. In this, however, &s;he was prevented by the exertions of the negroes who rowed the boat, and was puni&s;hed by her mi&s;tre&s;s with three or four hundred la&s;hes for her daring temerity.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud moved on the 20th, with all his troops, from Magdenberg, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h his head-quarters nearer the infirmary. His army being in a very &s;ickly condition, he fixed upon the e&s;tate called New Ro&s;enback, &s;ituated between the Hope and the ho&s;pital, for his encampment. Thither I immediately repaired, to pay my re&s;pects to the chief; when I &s;aw the remainder of his mi&s;erable army landed, and received a further detail of the campaign. I have already mentioned Captain Fredericy's being wounded; one man lo&s;t by neglect, and another cut and di&s;armed; the captives running away, chains and all; the hero &s;coffed at, and ridiculed by his &s;able enemies:&mdash;I &s;hall now add, that a &s;ick marine was left to die or recover by him&s;elf; and that one of the &s;laves, by bad u&s;age, had his arm broke. The captive negro woman was al&s;o gone, never more to return to her conqueror, con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in &s;ize from her connection with the troops, and likely to pre|&s;ent a new recruit to her du&s;ky monarch. The&s;e were the particulars of the la&s;t campaign. But I mu&s;t mention
<PB N="331" REF="398">
the humanity of a poor &s;lave, who, at every hazard, de&s;erted Fourgeoud to attend the dying marine; and having performed the la&s;t &s;ad office of friend&s;hip, re|turned to receive his puni&s;hment, but to his infinite &s;urprize was pardoned.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to Colonel Fourgeoud I mu&s;t &s;ay, that upon &s;uch expeditions, and in &s;uch a climate, many of the&s;e accidents cannot be prevented; and that while he killed his troops by &s;cores, without making captures on the enemy, he neverthele&s;s did the colony con&s;iderable &s;er|vice, by di&s;turbing, hunting, and hara&s;&s;ing the rebels, and de&s;troying their fields and provi&s;ions. For, it is certain, no negro will ever return to &s;ettle in tho&s;e haunts from which he has been once expelled. Colonel Fourgeoud's partaking per&s;onally in every danger and fatigue at his age, mu&s;t make &s;ome amends for the other faults that &s;tained his character, and may even &s;erve, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to e&s;tabli&s;h his reputation as a man of pa|tience and fortitude. It would give me infinitely more plea&s;ure to write nothing but in his prai&s;e; but truth, and the general benefit of mankind, requires, that whil&s;t I di&s;play his good qualities I al&s;o point out his failings, as they may &s;erve to correct others, and by the&s;e means even his vices may be rendered u&s;eful. What could be more ridiculous, than paying his troops with &s;ilver at Paramaribo, where paper was ju&s;t as good? and now, while in the rivers, giving them cards, for which they
<PB N="332" REF="399">
could not procure a yam or a bunch of plantains, while he had whole che&s;ts of &s;pecie in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? But his object was to gain a profit of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> on the pay of the whole regiment, and for this he was ju&s;tly blamed by the corps in general.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, &s;everal officers came to vi&s;it me at the Hope, whom I entertained with a fi&s;h dinner&mdash;among&s;t which were the <HI>kawiry,</HI> the <HI>lamper,</HI> and <HI>macrely-fi&s;y,</HI> all which I &s;hall briefly de&s;cribe. The kawiry is a &s;mall fi&s;h without &s;cales, the head is large, with two long antennae or whi&s;kers projecting from the upper jaw, and is very plentiful in the rivers. The lamper is a &s;pecies of the lampern, that are caught in the Thames: tho&s;e of Surinam are not large, but very fat, of a round &s;hape, &s;limy or glutinous; its colour a bluei&s;h green with yellow &s;pots, except the belly, which is white; this fi&s;h, like the &s;almon, frequents both the &s;ea and the rivers. The macrely-fi&s;y re&s;embles a mackarel, whence it has its name, only its colour is more bluei&s;h, and not near &s;o &s;plendid.</P>
<P>We were very happy, and my gue&s;ts perfectly &s;atisfied with their entertainment. But on the morning of the 22d my poor Joanna, who had been our cook, was attacked with a violent fever; &s;he de&s;ired to be removed to Fau|conberg, there to be attended by one of her female re|lations, which I complied with. But on the evening of the 25th &s;he was &s;o extremely ill, that I determined to
<PB N="333" REF="400">
vi&s;it her my&s;elf, but as privately as po&s;&s;ible, as Four|geoud was to vi&s;it me at the Hope the next day; for his &s;atirical jokes upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion I could very well di&s;pen&s;e with; and I knew the mo&s;t laudable motives were no protection again&s;t the ungovernable &s;allies of his temper.</P>
<P>However difficult the undertaking, as I had to pa&s;s clo&s;e to his po&s;t, I like another Leander was determined to cro&s;s the Helle&s;pont; of which having informed my friend Heneman, I &s;et out about eleven at night in my own barge, when coming oppo&s;ite New Ro&s;enback, I heard Fourgeoud's voice very di&s;tinctly, as he walked on the beach with &s;ome other officers, and immediately the boat was hailed by a &s;entinel, and ordered to come a&s;hore. I now thought all was over; but, per&s;i&s;ting to the la&s;t, I told the negroes to an&s;wer <HI>Kille&s;lyn Nova,</HI> the name of an adjoining plantation, and thus got leave to proceed unmole&s;ted. Soon after I arrived &s;afe at Fau|conberg, and found my deare&s;t friend much better.</P>
<P>But on the 26th, in the morning, mi&s;taking the day-light for moon-&s;hine, I over&s;lept my&s;elf, and knew not how to return to the Hope, as my barge and negroes could now not pa&s;s without being well known to the Co|lonel. Delay was u&s;ele&s;s; &s;o out I &s;et, tru&s;ting entirely to the ingenuity of my &s;laves, who put me a&s;hore ju&s;t be|fore we came in &s;ight of the head-quarters; when one of them e&s;corted me through the woods, and I arrived
<PB N="334" REF="401">
&s;afe at the Hope. But here my barge &s;oon followed under a guard, and all my poor &s;laves pri&s;oners, with an order from Fourgeoud for me to flog every one of them, as they had been apprehended without a pa&s;s, while their excu&s;e was that they had been out a fi&s;hing for their <HI>Ma&s;&s;era.</HI></P>
<P>Their fidelity to me upon this occa&s;ion was truly a&s;to|ni&s;hing, as they all declared they would have preferred being cut in pieces, rather than betray the &s;ecrets of &s;o good a ma&s;ter. However, the danger was &s;oon over, as I confirmed what they had &s;aid, and added, that the fi&s;h were intended to <HI>regale the hero</HI>; after which I made a donation of two gallons of rum among my &s;able privy-coun&s;ellors. This pa&s;&s;age, however trifling, may &s;erve as a &s;ample not only of European weakne&s;s, but of African firmne&s;s and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my preparation, &s;till Colonel Four|geoud did not vi&s;it me on the 27th, but the next morning Joanna arrived, accompanied by a &s;tout black, who was her uncle, and who&s;e arm was decorated with a &s;ilver band, on which were engraved the&s;e words:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"True to the Europeans."</Q>
This man, who was named Cojo, having voluntarily fought again&s;t the rebels, before his companions, by the inhuman treatment of Mr. D. B. and his over&s;eer, had been forced to join them. From the&s;e he related to us the following remarkable &s;tory, having a little girl, called Tamera, by the hand:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This child's father,"
&s;aid he, "is one who&s;e name is Jolly
<PB N="335" REF="402">
Coeur, the fir&s;t captain belonging to Baron's men, and, not without cau&s;e, one of the fierce&s;t rebels in the fore&s;t, which he has lately &s;hewn on the neighbouring e&s;tate of New Ro&s;enback, where your colonel now commands. On that e&s;tate one Schults, a Jew, being the manager at that time, who formerly was the manager of Faucon|berg, the rebels &s;uddenly appeared, and took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the whole plantation. Having tied the hands of Schults, and plundered the hou&s;e, they next began to fea&s;ting and dancing, before they thought proper to end his mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. In this deplorable &s;ituation now lay the victim, only waiting Baron's &s;ignal for death, when his eyes chancing to catch the above captain's, Jolly Coeur, he addre&s;&s;ed him nearly in the following words: &mdash;'O Jolly Coeur, now remember Mr. Schults, who was once your deputy-ma&s;ter; remember the dainties I gave you from my own table, when you were only a child, and my favourite, my darling, among &s;o many others: re|member this, and now &s;pare my life by your powerful interce&s;&s;ion.'&mdash;The reply of Jolly Coeur was memorable: &mdash;I remember it perfectly well: 'But you, O tyrant, re|collect how you ravi&s;hed my poor mother, and flogged my father for coming to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Recollect, that the &s;hameful act was perpetrated in my infant pre&s;ence &mdash;Recollect this&mdash;then die by my hands, and next be damn'd.'&mdash;Saying this, he &s;evered his head from his body with a hatchet at one blow; with which having played
<PB N="336" REF="403">
at bowls upon the beach, he next cut the &s;kin with a knife from his back, which he &s;pread over one of the cannon to keep the priming dry."</Q>
&mdash;Thus ended the hi&s;|tory of Mr. Schults; when Cojo, with young Tamera, departed, and left me to go, with an increa&s;ed impatience, to receive the news, that I &s;oon was to expect from Am|&s;terdam, <HI>viz.</HI> when the de&s;erving Joanna &s;hould be free from the villainy of &s;uch pe&s;ts of human nature.</P>
<P>On the 28th, Colonel Fourgeoud arrived about ten o'clock with one of his officers, and with the very devil painted in his countenance, which alarmed me much. I, however, in&s;tantly introduced him to my cottage, where he no &s;ooner &s;aw my mate, than the clouds (like a vapour by the &s;un) were di&s;pelled from his gloomy forehead: and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I never &s;aw him behave with more civility.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV.</NOTE>HAVING delayed his departure to the 29th of April, Colonel Fourgeoud now finally rowed down for Paramaribo, accompanied by a few of his officers, to refre&s;h them&s;elves; of which, in truth, they had great need, while an armed barge kept floating up and down the river, and while the remaining emaciated troops (which were melted down to a very &s;mall number, and unfit, till recruited in their con&s;titutions, for any further military &s;ervice) greatly required &s;ome re&s;t. Ju&s;t before the chief's departure, he &s;ent me (who now commanded the river) the following very curious in&s;tructions, which, as a proof of his general&s;hip, I cannot help in&s;erting: Among&s;t others,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to a&s;k the planters if the rebels were come to their e&s;tates, in which ca&s;e to attack and drive them away; but not to follow them, unle&s;s I was &s;ure that I certainly &s;hould conquer them, and for any mi&s;|carriage I &s;hould be called to an account;"</Q>

However judicious the other articles I had received, I could not help thinking the above &s;o very ab&s;urd, that I immediately returned them back by an officer, and had the good fortune (at my reque&s;t) to get them changed into common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>How happy was I at this time in particular, who wanted for nothing, and who had &s;uch an agreeable partner con|&s;tantly near me, who&s;e &s;weet conver&s;ation was divine mu&s;ic to my ears, and who&s;e pre&s;ence bani&s;hed every languor and hard&s;hip from my mind!</P>
<P>One day, &s;traying with me through a watery &s;avanna, I &s;hot a bird, which I found to be the &s;pur-winged water-hen of Edwards. This beautiful creature is &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the plover kind, with the body about the &s;ize of a pigeon, being of a deep cinnamon colour, between red and a very rich orange; the neck and belly are perfectly black, the larger feathers of the wings of a bright yellow, and armed on each pinion with a &s;hort and &s;harp horny &s;pur, which it u&s;es for its defence, as game-cocks u&s;e theirs in England. It has no tail; its bill is near two inches in length; its legs are long, and, as well as the bill, are of a yellowi&s;h green colour; its toes, e&s;pecially the hinder ones, are of a remarkable length, and &s;eem calculated to &s;upport its weight in the mud, where it is mo&s;t frequently &s;een, if not wading in the water to &s;eek its food. The&s;e birds, like plovers, never &s;wim; they have
<PB N="340" REF="407">
a &s;carlet cre&s;t and &s;mall pearls (like tho&s;e of the Mu&s;covy duck) &s;eparating the bill from the eyes; they are always &s;een in pairs, and when they fly produce an agreeable whi&s;tling from their throats. The &s;pur-winged water|hen, on account of its great beauty, reminded me of another fine bird I lately &s;aw upon one of the neighbour|ing e&s;tates, but which I had forgotten to mention: this was the Guiana curlew, here called <HI>flamingo,</HI> from its great re&s;emblance to the famous bird of that name, &s;een in Canada and many parts of North and South America, and which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the crane kind, with its body as large as that of an European &s;wan. This bird, however, is only the &s;ize of a &s;mall heron; it has no tail, but a very long neck, and long limbs, with four toes: the head is &s;mall, and the bill al&s;o long, round, and arched. The flamingo lays always two eggs, which, when hatched, the chickens appear black, next grey, then white, as they come nearer maturity; and, finally, the whole bird becomes a bright &s;carlet or crim&s;on, &s;ome not lighter than the colour of blood. They live in &s;o|ciety like the &s;torks, and mo&s;tly on the banks of rivers, or near the &s;ea, where they are &s;een in &s;uch amazing flocks, that the &s;ands &s;eem dyed with vermilion; the&s;e birds, when young, are accounted very good eating, and are &s;o tame, that on the plantations they are frequently &s;een walking and feeding among the poultry, though fi&s;h and animal food they generally prefer.</P>

<P><PB N="341" REF="409">Thus I daily found &s;ome new object to de&s;cribe, and &s;pent the mo&s;t agreeable hours, con&s;tantly accompanied by my young mulatto, upon this Ely&s;ian plantation&mdash;but alas! all at once, in the mid&s;t of my hopes, my truly halcyon days were bla&s;ted, and I was almo&s;t plunged into de&s;pair, by receiving the fatal news of the death of Mr. Pa&s;&s;alage at Am&s;terdam, to whom I had written to obtain my mulatto's manumi&s;&s;ion; and what mu&s;t certainly re|double my di&s;tre&s;s, was the &s;ituation in which &s;he proved to be, promi&s;ing fair to become a mother in the &s;pace of a few months. It was now that I &s;aw a thou&s;and horrors intrude all at once upon my dejected &s;pirits; not only my friend but my offspring to be a &s;lave, and a &s;lave under &s;uch a government!&mdash;Mr. Pa&s;&s;alage, on whom I relied, dead &mdash;the whole e&s;tate going to be &s;old to a new ma&s;ter&mdash;I could not bear it, and was totally di&s;tracted; nay, mu&s;t have died of grief, had not the mildne&s;s of her temper &s;up|ported me, by &s;ugge&s;ting the flattering hopes that Lol|kens would &s;till be our friend. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflections, on the evening of the 4th, we heard the report of &s;everal alarm-guns towards the North Ea&s;t, on which, by day-break next morning, I &s;ent a detachment to Rio-Pirica, which returned about noon with the ac|count of the rebels attacking the e&s;tate Mer&s;eille, in the river Cottica; but that they had been beaten back by the plantation &s;laves, as they had before by tho&s;e of Korten|duur. The other news was, that they had ill treated a party of poor Indians, &s;u&s;pecting them to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="342" REF="410">
the e&s;tates in making their defence; al&s;o that at Parama|ribo, an in&s;urrection was di&s;covered among the negroes, who had determined to join the rebels, after fir&s;t having ma&s;&s;acred all the inhabitants; that, however, they were detected, and the ringleaders executed.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 6th, we again heard &s;everal mu&s;quet-&s;hot in the woods, which apprehending to be &s;ome European party that had lo&s;t their way, I made my &s;entinel an&s;wer the &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, by firing his piece alternately with theirs, &s;hot for &s;hot, to which I added two drums, that kept beating for &s;everal hours without intermi&s;&s;ion, when the report of their fire-arms gradu|ally approached nearer and nearer: and now at length appeared a Society &s;erjeant and &s;ix privates that belonged to Reedwyk in Pirica, and had been lo&s;t in the fore&s;t for three days, nearly &s;tarved, without hammocks, meat, or drink, excepting water. Having refre&s;hed them in the be&s;t manner I was able, they all recovered to my very great &s;atisfaction, though one of them remained perfectly blind for &s;everal hours, with the &s;ting of a kind of wa&s;ps, which are known in this country by the name of <HI>ma|robon&s;o</HI>; of which the only thing that I can &s;ay is, that they are extremely large, live in hollow trees, are the &s;tronge&s;t of the bee kind, and &s;ting &s;o violently, that the pain is excruciating, and always occa&s;ions a fever.</P>
<P>Having, on the 12th, &s;wam twice acro&s;s the river Cot|tica, which is above half a mile broad, I came home in a &s;hiver, and next day had an intermitting fever: by ab|&s;taining,
<PB N="343" REF="411">
however, from animal food, and u&s;ing plenty of acid with my drink, I had no doubt of getting well in a few days; the more &s;o, as tamarinds grew here in profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Indeed, on the 16th, I was almo&s;t perfectly recovered, (weakne&s;s excepted) when about ten in the morning, as I was &s;itting with Joanna before my cottage, I had an un|expected vi&s;it from a Mr. Steger, who happened to be one of our &s;urgeons. After having felt my pul&s;e, and ex|amined my tongue, he declared without ceremony that I &s;hould be dead before the morrow, unle&s;s without fur|ther delay I made u&s;e of his pre&s;cription. I acknowledge the &s;entence &s;taggered me &s;o much that, though at other times I never u&s;ed medicines at all, I in&s;tantly &s;wallowed the do&s;e, which he had prepared for me in a tumbler, without he&s;itation, but almo&s;t as in&s;tantly I dropped down on the ground.</P>
<P>In this manner I lay till the 20th, being four days be|fore I came to my &s;en&s;es, when I found my&s;elf &s;tretched on a mattra&s;s in my little hou&s;e, with poor Joanna &s;itting by me alone, and bathed in tears, who begged of me at that time to a&s;k no que&s;tions, for fear of hurting my &s;pirits, but who next day related to me the di&s;mal tran&s;|action, <HI>viz.</HI> that the moment I fell, four &s;trong negroes had taken me up, and by her direction placed me where I now was; that the &s;urgeon having put bli&s;ters on &s;e|veral parts of my body, had finally declared that I was dead, and had &s;uddenly left the plantation, when a grave
<PB N="344" REF="412">
and coffin were ordered for my burial on the 17th, which &s;he had prevented by dropping upon her knees to im|plore a delay; that &s;he had di&s;patched a black to her aunt at Fauconberg for wine-vinegar, and a bottle of old Rheni&s;h, with the fir&s;t of which &s;he had con&s;tantly bathed my temples, wri&s;ts, and feet, by keeping without intermi&s;&s;ion five wet hankerchiefs tied about them, while with a tea-&s;poon &s;he had found means to make me &s;wal|low a few drops of the wine mulled; that I had lain motionle&s;s during all that time; while &s;he had day and night, by the help of Quacoo and an old negro, attended me, &s;till hoping for my recovery: for which &s;he now thanked her God. To all this I could only an&s;wer by the tear of &s;ympathy that &s;tarted from my eyes, and a feeble &s;queeze of my hand.</P>
<P>I had, however, the good fortune to recover, but &s;o &s;lowly that, notwith&s;tanding the great care that was taken of me by that excellent young woman, (to whom alone I owed my life) it was the 15th of June before I could walk by my&s;elf, during all which time I was carried on a &s;pecies of chair by two negroes, &s;upported on two poles like a &s;edan, and fed like an infant, being &s;o lame and enervated that I was not able to bring my hand to my mouth; while poor Joanna (who had &s;uffered too much on my account) was for &s;everal days following very ill her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Great was the change from what I had been but &s;o &s;hortly before&mdash;then the mo&s;t healthy and mo&s;t happy
<PB N="345" REF="413">
in body and mind, and now depre&s;&s;ed to the lowe&s;t ebb, in my con&s;titution and my &s;pirits. My friend Heneman, who vi&s;ited me every day, at this time told me that upon information he had di&s;covered the medicine which had &s;o nearly killed me to be only tartar-emetick and ipeca|cuanha, but in too great a quantity, <HI>viz.</HI> four grains of the fir&s;t, mixed with forty grains of the latter; the &s;urgeon having mea&s;ured my con&s;titution by my &s;ize, which is above &s;ix feet. I was &s;o much incen&s;ed at this piece of &s;tupidity, that on the 4th of June, having drank his Britannic Maje&s;ty's health in a rummer of Madeira, and the fatal &s;urgeon coming to make me a bow, he no &s;ooner put his foot on the landing-place, where I was &s;it|ting in my palanquin or chair for air, than, having pre|viou&s;ly clubbed one of the poles that carried me, upon my &s;houlder, I let it fall upon his guilty pericranium, my &s;trength being as yet too feeble to aim a blow. The poor fellow no &s;ooner felt the weight of the pole, than forgetting the re&s;t of his compliments, he &s;kipped back into his boat with all expedition, with which he decamped as fa&s;t as the negroes could row him, to our no &s;mall en|tertainment, who &s;aluted him with three cheers.</P>
<P>About this time, while the troops were doing nothing, two of the brave&s;t men in the colony, with the rangers, entered the woods, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain Fredericy, and the militia captain, Stoelman; they killed three or four of the re|bels, and took a few more pri&s;oners, who had been &s;tarv|ing for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence ever &s;ince Fourgeoud had ran|&s;acked
<PB N="346" REF="414">
the &s;urrounding fore&s;t, and de&s;troyed their fields. In the creek Patamaca, al&s;o two rebel negroes, attempt|ing to plunder Mr. Winey's plantation, were &s;hot by his &s;laves, who &s;ent their right hands barbacued to Para|maribo.</P>
<P>Being &s;till &s;o weak that I was unfit for any duty, even at the Hope, I now &s;urrendered the command of that po&s;t to the next officer in rank: and expecting that a change of air would be beneficial to me, with the previ|ous knowledge of Colonel Fourgeoud, I went on a vi&s;it to a neighbouring e&s;tate, called Egmond, where the planter, Mon&s;ieur de Cachelieu, a French gentleman, had given me a mo&s;t hearty invitation, with Joanna, my boy Quaco, and a white &s;ervant. At this place I was extreme|ly comfortable, and nothing could be better calculated for my &s;peedy recovery than this Frenchman's ho&s;pitality and good-humour. How incon&s;i&s;tent with this was his in|ju&s;tice and &s;everity to his &s;laves! For in&s;tance, two young negroes, who well de&s;erved a flogging, by breaking in and robbing their ma&s;ter's &s;tore-hou&s;e, came off with a few la&s;hes; while two old ones, for a trifling di&s;pute, were each condemned to receive no le&s;s than three hundred.</P>
<P>On my a&s;king the cau&s;e of this partiality, I was an|&s;wered by Mon&s;. de Cachelieu, that the young ones had &s;till a very good &s;kin, and might do much work; whereas the old ones had long been disfigured, worn out, and almo&s;t unfit for any &s;ervice; nay, that killing them al|together would be a benefit to the e&s;tate.&mdash;At Arentru&s;t,
<PB N="347" REF="415">
a few plantations lower down, &s;ome days before, a poor negro was &s;ent with a letter from his proprietor to the manager there&mdash;this la&s;t, not liking the contents, gave the me&s;&s;enger four hundred la&s;hes, telling the innocent man, at the &s;ame time, to carry that for the an&s;wer to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But to return to my French ho&s;t, (who was, in this alone excepted, as polite, ho&s;pitable, and well-bred a man as ever I would wi&s;h to conver&s;e with) I mu&s;t men|tion &s;ome particulars of his remarkable oeconomy, <HI>viz.</HI> a We&s;t-India rabbit, called in Surinam <HI>coney coney,</HI> and by the Indians <HI>puccarara,</HI> but properly the <HI>agouti,</HI> I &s;aw one day come roa&s;ted to the table. Of this, he and I eat one quarter. Next day it made its appearance <HI>a la crapodine,</HI> that is, with &s;alt and pepper on the gridiron. The third day the remaining half entered in the form of a French frica&s;ee; and a fourth, the la&s;t quarter was converted into what I call meagre &s;oup.</P>
<P>This I relate as a fact; and though the planter, his over&s;eer, his dog, and his two cats, could not weigh fourteen &s;tone among&s;t them all, no family in Surinam could be more healthy or contented.&mdash;As an in&s;tance of ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s, the over&s;eer, Mr. Bodewyn, declared that he never had fought a battle, &s;ired a mu&s;quet, mount|ed a hor&s;e, or taken any illicit freedom; though he ac|knowledged he was every day dre&s;&s;ed and &s;haved by the &s;oft hand of a young negro female.</P>
<P>Nothing could be better than the oranges and china
<PB N="348" REF="416">
apples that I found on this e&s;tate.&mdash;The fir&s;t I have al|ready de&s;cribed; and, though often confounded with the latter, it is a very di&s;tinct fruit upon the whole. The china apples, or civil oranges, as they are u&s;ually called, differ in this from the other oranges, that they are more lucid, and of a more &s;avoury ta&s;te; that the &s;hell is &s;moother, thin|ner, and not &s;o deep coloured; and particularly, that while the oranges may be eaten in any quantity, without per|nicious con&s;equences, the immoderate u&s;e of the china apples is by long experience in this colony found to pro|duce very dangerous effects. This fruit being here much the &s;ame as that which comes from Li&s;bon, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been imported at fir&s;t (as was the other) by the Portugue&s;e or the Spaniards; and it may well be con|ceived, that in tho&s;e countries, where it drops ripe from the trees in golden clu&s;ters, it mu&s;t be incomparably more delicious than it can ever be ta&s;ted in Great Britain, being &s;ent thither green, after which it indeed becomes orange, but can never arrive to its proper &s;tate of matu|rity. As for the fine fragrance that is diffu&s;ed through all this colony, by the continued groves of orange-blo&s;|&s;oms and odoriferous fruits that it produces, it can be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. I al&s;o found &s;ome fine lemons on this e&s;tate, which however are here thick &s;helled, but very large. There are al&s;o a &s;pecies of &s;weet ones, which are &s;maller, and which have, in my opinion, a very in&s;ipid ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Having mentioned Mon&s;. de Cachelieu's fine fruit, I
<PB N="349" REF="417">
ought not to forget his excellent French wines, which were perfectly unadulterated and truly delicious, parti|cularly his mu&s;cadell. But in &s;pite of all the&s;e good things, I &s;till continued a valetudinarian, being oppre&s;&s;ed with weakne&s;s and indige&s;tion. Thus, in hopes that ex|erci&s;e on hor&s;eback might do me good, I determined to take leave of my ho&s;pitable French friend, and a&s;k leave of ab&s;ence to go for &s;ome time to Paramaribo.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, on the 9th, Colonel Fourgeoud arriv|ing in the river at the e&s;tate Crawa&s;&s;ibo, and expecting &s;oon to renew his manoeuvres, I, on the 10th, wrote him a letter for the above purpo&s;e, and al&s;o for above &s;ix months pay, which was due to me. I was an&s;wered, on the 12th, not only with a negative to both my reque&s;ts, which had been granted to other officers, but in &s;o truly impertinent a &s;tyle, as I could not, even from him&s;elf, have expected&mdash;&s;uch as calling in que&s;tion my zeal, though he knew I was &s;ick; and refu&s;ing me my own money, or even the proper remedies and means of recovering. This incen&s;ed me &s;o much, that I wrote him a &s;econd letter, to let him know I was incapable of doing or a&s;king any thing unbecoming my character, but on the contrary (ill as I was) ready to give him no &s;uch proofs of my honour as &s;hould leave him no farther room to doubt of it, &s;hould he be plea&s;ed to put it to the proof. This epi&s;tle, weak and unfit as I was for &s;er|vice, I followed in per&s;on two days after, with my French
<PB N="350" REF="418">
friend Cachelieu for my companion and voucher, who gave me the u&s;e of his tilt-barge with eight oars for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On our arrival I expected to &s;ee Fourgeoud raging with re&s;entment, that he would put me under an arre&s;t, and a&s;k an explanation of our la&s;t corre&s;pondence. But I dreaded not the wor&s;t that he could do, after the many trials to ruin me which he had already put in execution, and death it&s;elf was almo&s;t preferable to his cruelty.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Cachelieu and I, however, were both di&s;|appointed. He not only took us politely by the hand, but &s;olicited us to dine with him, as if nothing had hap|pened. But this affectation I de&s;pi&s;ed, and refu&s;ed to ac|cept of his invitation with contempt, in which I was followed by the French planter. When, in my turn, I enquired for the cau&s;e of his refu&s;ing my reque&s;t, and &s;ending me &s;o &s;trange a letter, this was the an&s;wer&mdash; That thirty or forty of the Ouca negroes, who were our allies by treaty, had deceived him, in doing nothing while they had been in the woods, and during the time he had been at Paramaribo: that he was in con&s;equence determined to pu&s;h on the war with double vigour; on which account he had not only forbidden me to go to town, but had &s;ince ordered even all the &s;ick officers to come up and to follow the enemy, while they had &s;trength or breath remaining, not &s;o much as leaving one at Paramaribo to guard the colours and the re|giment's che&s;t, which had both been left to the care of
<PB N="351" REF="419">
a quarter-ma&s;ter.&mdash;This, indeed, was literally the fact; but to this he might &s;afely, and without hurting his con&s;cience, have added, the inveteracy of his di&s;po&s;ition, with which he had determined to per&s;ecute me and &s;ome others to annihilation. I ought to mention, that it was not till about this time that he i&s;&s;ued orders to be ob&s;erved on a march, and that previous to this every thing was performed in perfect hurry and confu&s;ion, which indeed even afterwards was too frequently the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Having now been near two months on the e&s;tate Eg|mond, where I could not recover, and not being permitted to go to Paramaribo, I preferred returning back again to take the command at the Hope; where having entertained Mon&s;ieur de Cachelieu in the be&s;t manner I was able, this gentleman in the evening returned to his plantation.</P>
<P>At the Hope I found my friend Mr. Heneman (who was now made a captain) very &s;ick, with &s;everal others. All the&s;e, as well as my&s;elf, were left without a &s;urgeon, medicines, or money; while, as I &s;tated before, the many hog&s;heads of wine &s;ent from Am&s;terdam, together with &s;cores of kegs containing pre&s;erved vegetables, and other fre&s;h provi&s;ions, were forever kept invi&s;ible from the poor, emaciated, and langui&s;hing troops, for whom they had certainly been intended by that city. I indeed here made one more attempt to recover our property, but to no purpo&s;e; money, medicines, wine, and refre&s;hments, were all kept back. Thus did we continue to pine and lo&s;e &s;trength, in&s;tead of gaining it. I mean the greate&s;t part
<PB N="352" REF="420">
of us: as for my&s;elf, I had the lea&s;t cau&s;e to complain, be|ing well attended by Joanna and my &s;ervants, who the next day all arrived from Egmond at the Hope, be&s;ides receiving pre&s;ents, which were as u&s;ual &s;ent me from all quarters. One additional inconvenience I however felt&mdash; my feet were infe&s;ted with chigoes, which I partly im|pute to having, during my illne&s;s, worn &s;tockings and &s;hoes while at the good Frenchman's e&s;tate Egmond. Of this trouble&s;ome in&s;ect I have already made &s;ome mention, as being extremely numerous at Devil's Harwar, but now &s;hall circum&s;tantially de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>The <HI>chigoe</HI> is a kind of &s;mall &s;and-flea, that gets in between the &s;kin and the fle&s;h without its being felt, and generally under the nails of the toes; where, while it feeds, it keeps growing till it becomes the &s;ize of a large pea, cau&s;ing no further pain than a di&s;agreeable itching; in proce&s;s of time it appears in the form of a &s;mall bladder, in which are depo&s;ited thou&s;ands of eggs or nits, and which, if it breaks, produce &s;o many young chigoes, that in cour&s;e of time create running ulcers, which are often of very dangerous con&s;equence to the patient: &s;o much &s;o, indeed, that I have known a &s;ol|dier, the &s;oles of who&s;e feet were obliged to be cut away with a razor, before he could recover; and &s;ome men have lo&s;t their limbs by amputation&mdash;nay even their lives, by having neglected in time to root out the&s;e abo|minable vermin. The moment, therefore, that one per|ceives a kind of itching and redne&s;s more than u&s;ual
<PB N="353" REF="421">
about the feet, it is time to begin extracting the chigoe that occa&s;ions it: this is done with a &s;harp-pointed needle, at which operation the black girls are extremely dexterous, taking every care not to occa&s;ion unnece&s;&s;ary pain, and to prevent the chigoo or bladder from breaking in the wound. The cure is to put tobacco-a&s;hes in the orifice, by which in a little time it is perfectly healed. Being at this time, as I have ju&s;t mentioned, infe&s;ted with the chigoes, Joanna with her needle picked twenty-three of the&s;e in&s;ects out of my left foot; which being all hatched under the nails, cau&s;ed, as may be imagined, the mo&s;t ter|rible torment, but which I bore without flinching, with the re&s;olution of an African negro. The&s;e are the in&s;ects called <HI>niquas</HI> by the Spaniards at Carthagena.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t I received a letter from the commander in chief, not an an&s;wer to my la&s;t, but orders to &s;end him up to the e&s;tate Crawa&s;&s;ibo (which was at pre&s;ent his head-quarters) all the provi&s;ions, kettles, axes, &amp;c. that could be &s;pared from the Hope, as he was preparing to re-enter the woods. I accordingly di&s;patched them the next day: but the &s;upply of victuals was not great; for a whole barge, with beef and pork, bound for the Hope, had been &s;hipwrecked in the river.</P>
<P>On the 25th Mr. Steger, the &s;urgeon who had &s;o nearly poi&s;oned me that I could not yet get the better of the effects of his ignorance, was di&s;charged from the re|giment, as incapable of his profe&s;&s;ion. Still, notwith|&s;tanding my un&s;ettled &s;tate of health, as &s;everal officers
<PB N="354" REF="422">
were going to join Fourgeoud about this time, and weak as I was, I intreated once more to be one of the party. But on the morning of the 26th, his adjutant, with another &s;ur|geon, vi&s;iting all the troops that were in Comewina, I was deemed totally incapable of &s;upporting the fatigue: in|deed &s;o much &s;o, that relap&s;ing on the 29th, I was even glad to be &s;uper&s;eded in the command of the river by the major, Mr. Medlar, who arrived at the Hope this day for that purpo&s;e. Neverthele&s;s I was condemned to linger at this place, while one month at Paramaribo might have perfectly recovered me.&mdash;I had now nothing to do but to continue my drawings, for which the above gentleman at that time offered me one hundred crowns, but my de&s;ire was, if po&s;&s;ible, to complete the collection; and when I had the &s;trength, I walked round the plan|tation with my gun. Among&s;t others, I &s;hot, on the 3d of September, a &s;mall bird, called <HI>kibry-fowlo,</HI> on ac|count of its continuing in a manner con&s;tantly under co|ver. It was about the &s;ize of a thru&s;h, and very much the colour of a quail, which it al&s;o exactly re&s;embled in &s;hape, but the limbs were rather longer, and the bill was ex|tremely &s;harp-pointed. This bird is very &s;eldom &s;een on the wing, but runs incredibly fa&s;t through the gra&s;s and &s;avannas, where it hides it&s;elf the in&s;tant it is per|ceived. When dre&s;&s;ed, it was as fat as a lump of butter, and as delicious as an European ortolan.</P>
<P>On the 11th of September, Fourgeoud at la&s;t broke up from Crawa&s;&s;ibo, and, with all the able troops he could
<PB N="355" REF="423">
collect (which were now not much more than one hundred) he again marched into the fore&s;t after the enemy; having previou&s;ly taken away the po&s;t from the Jew Savannah, which he placed at the for&s;aken e&s;tate Oranjebo, in the very upper parts of Rio Comewina, leaving the river Surinam to take care of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the 19th of this month in the forenoon, a herd of wild &s;wine, called <HI>pingos,</HI> (more than two hundred in number) having lo&s;t their way in the fore&s;t, came to the Hope, galloping over the plantation, when above a &s;core of them were killed by the negroes, who knocked them down with their bill-hooks and axes. In Surinam the wild boars are of three &s;pecies; which I will embrace this opportunity to de&s;cribe &mdash; the&s;e are the <HI>pingos</HI> or <HI>waree</HI> above-mentioned, the <HI>cras-pingo,</HI> and the Mexican hog, called the <HI>peccary.</HI> The <HI>pingos</HI> are about the &s;ize of our Engli&s;h &s;mall hogs; they are black, and have coar&s;e bri&s;tles thinly &s;cattered; they live in herds of &s;ometimes above three hundred, in the thicke&s;t parts of the fore&s;t, and run always in a line, the one clo&s;ely fol|lowing the other; when the foremo&s;t or leader is &s;hot, the line is in&s;tantly broken, and the whole herd is in confu&s;ion; for which rea&s;on the Indians take care (if po&s;&s;ible) to knock their captain on the head before the re&s;t; after this the others even often &s;tand &s;till, &s;tupidly looking at one another, and allowing them|&s;elves to be killed one by one, of which I have been a witne&s;s. They do not attack the human &s;pecies, nor
<PB N="356" REF="424">
make any re&s;i&s;tance at all, like the European wild-boar, when wounded, as has been by &s;ome authors errone|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted. As for their attacking dogs, I can &s;ay nothing about it, never having had any with me when I met them.&mdash;The <HI>cras-pingos</HI> are large, armed with &s;trong tu&s;ks, and their bri&s;tles &s;till coar&s;er than the former. This large &s;pecies indeed are very dangerous, as well from their &s;trength as their ferocity, attacking any thing that ob&s;tructs them in their way, e&s;pecially when wounded. They move in the &s;ame manner, and in as large herds, as the former, but inhabit chiefly the more inland parts of the country. Both the&s;e &s;pecies, when they hear the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e in the fore&s;t that in|dicates danger, &s;top &s;hort in their cour&s;e, form in a clo&s;e body, and gna&s;h their teeth, preparing them&s;elves for defence again&s;t the enemy: I am of opinion that the&s;e are not natural to Guiana, but originally from Africa and Europe. Their fle&s;h is eaten with avidity by the natives, and even e&s;teemed by the white inhabitants, but is in my opinion dry, hard, and un&s;avoury.&mdash;That &s;pecies which is called the <HI>peccary</HI> or Mexican-hog, is alone &s;uppo&s;ed to be indigenous to Guiana, and will not intermix with either the wild or dome&s;tic hogs. This animal is parti|cularly remarkable by having an orifice on the back, which is vulgarly mi&s;taken for its navel, and which, be|ing about one inch deep, contains a &s;tinking fetid liquor, which &s;ome compare to the &s;mell of mu&s;k, but which is &s;o very di&s;agreeable, that the in&s;tant the animal is killed,

</FIGURE>
<PB N="357" REF="426">
the natives take care to cut away this part with a knife, to prevent its infecting the fle&s;h, which it would &s;oon do, making it &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting as not to be eatable. The length of the peccary is about three feet: it has no tail; fine limbs, &s;hort tu&s;ks, and yellowi&s;h grey bri&s;tles, much re&s;embling tho&s;e of an Engli&s;h hedge-hog; on the back they are very long, but on the &s;ides and on the belly they are both &s;hort and very thinly &s;cattered. This crea|ture has a light-coloured &s;pot that comes down from the &s;houlder on each &s;ide the brea&s;t, &s;omething like a hor&s;e-collar. Hogs of this &s;pecies are more uncommon in the low and mar&s;hy countries than in the inland parts, where they prefer feeding among&s;t the mountains and dry &s;avannas. The peccary is ea&s;ily tamed, and in that &s;tate harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive, but not &s;o &s;tupid as is a&s;&s;erted by the Count de Buffon, who &s;ays, they know no per&s;on, and have no attachment to tho&s;e that feed them; for Major Medlar had one at the Hope that followed him like a dog, and &s;hewed the greate&s;t delight in being care&s;&s;ed by its ma&s;ter. I ought al&s;o to ob&s;erve that it is, when irritated, very vicious and mi&s;chievous. They go in large herds as the other &s;pecies, produce many young at a time, and their grunting is extremely loud and di&s;|agreeable.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 29th, we again heard the report of &s;everal guns toward the river Cottica, where it &s;ince appeared the rebels were a &s;econd time beaten back from
<PB N="358" REF="427">
the plantation Mer&s;eille, by the fidelity and bravery of the &s;laves belonging to that e&s;tate.</P>
<P>On the 8th of the &s;ucceeding month, we received the news, that Colonel Fourgeoud, having di&s;covered and de|&s;troyed &s;ome fields belonging to the enemy (who had again kept up a di&s;tant conver&s;ation with him) and hav|ing found the mangled remains of poor Schmidt, who had been murdered by the rebels, as I related above, was once more come with his troops to Magdenberg, where he encamped till the eleventh. He then re-entered the fore&s;t, previou&s;ly &s;ending to the Hope the &s;ick, and with them a young officer under an arre&s;t, in order to be tried for not being able to undergo the fatigues as well as him&s;elf. In other words, having been ordered to watch two days and two nights, the youth had proved unequal to the ta&s;k, and had dropt a&s;leep under arms, as he was &s;itting on the ground. The climate indeed was &s;uch that even without the&s;e trials nature was often over|come.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ervation of Fourgeoud's vigour hitherto may, in a great mea&s;ure, be attributed to his continually drinking a medicine he called <HI>ti&s;an,</HI> in large full ba&s;ons, which had a mo&s;t nau&s;eous ta&s;te, and was compo&s;ed of the je&s;uits bark, cream of tartar, and &s;tick-liquorice, boil|ed together, which he drank as hot as he could bear it, and to which having accu&s;tomed his con&s;titution, he could not do without it. In this, however, he was fol|lowed
<PB N="359" REF="428">
by none of the re&s;t, as they were apprehen&s;ive that when this &s;hould once cea&s;e to operate, (which it mu&s;t at la&s;t) all other medicines in time of real need would be ineffectual. As for my own part, I &s;till conti|nued to be &s;o exceedingly weak, that I almo&s;t de&s;paired of evermore recovering; while my depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, on account of Joanna's critical and almo&s;t hopele&s;s &s;ituation, greatly contributed to prevent the re&s;toration of my health. The&s;e alarms were not dimini&s;hed on the 21&s;t, when, being vi&s;ited by Mr. and Mrs. Lolkens at the Hope, this gentleman told me, that the whole e&s;tate Fauconberg was again transferred, with its depen|dants, &s;ince the death of Mr. Pa&s;&s;alage; that the new proprietor was a Mr. Lude of Am&s;terdam, with whom he had not the &s;malle&s;t intere&s;t; and that there was in town a general report that we had both been poi&s;oned. This &s;entence was, however, greatly alleviated by the kindne&s;s of his lady, who in&s;i&s;ted that my Joanna &s;hould accom|pany her to Paramaribo immediately; where, at her own hou&s;e, &s;he &s;hould meet with every care and atten|tion that her &s;ituation could require, till perfectly reco|vered: for this I thanked her in the be&s;t manner I was able, and poor Joanna wept with gratitude. Having therefore conducted them as far as their e&s;tate Kille&s;tyn-Nova, where we dined, I took my leave of them and Joanna, and bid them all an affectionate farewell for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>At my return to the Hope, my indignation was &s;carcely
<PB N="360" REF="429">
to be re&s;trained within the bounds of prudence, when I found my&s;elf upbraided by my me&s;s-mates for taking care of my own offspring: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do as we do," &s;aid they,
"Stedman, and never fear. If our children are &s;laves, they are provided for; and if they die, what care we, &s;hould they be d&mdash;n'd in the bargain? Therefore keep your &s;ighs in your own belly, and your money in your pocket, my boy, that's all."</Q>
&mdash;I repeat this in their own language, to &s;hew how much my feeling mu&s;t have been hurt and di&s;gu&s;ted with fimilar con&s;olation.</P>
<P>The following morning, awaking by day-break in my hammock, the fir&s;t thing that I &s;aw, when looking up, was a &s;nake about two yards long, hanging with its head downwards like a rope, and &s;traight above my face, from which he was not one foot di&s;tance, while his tail was twi&s;ted round the rafters under the thatch. Ob&s;erv|ing his eyes bright as &s;tars, and his forked tongue in agi|tation, I was &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed that I &s;carcely had power to avoid him, which however I did, by running out; after which, I heard a ru&s;tling in the dry thatch, where the negroes attempted to kill him, but in vain, he having e&s;|caped, and thus I cannot &s;ay what &s;pecies he belonged to. Being now by my&s;elf, and rather &s;tartled by this unwel|come gue&s;t, I &s;hut up my hou&s;e, and lodged and me&s;&s;ed with my friends the Major, Heneman, and Macdonald.</P>
<P>On vi&s;iting my boxes, I now found that great depreda|tions had been committed by the ants, which are through|out all Guiana &s;o very numerous, and of &s;o many diffe|rent
<PB N="361" REF="430">
&s;pecies, that once I had a pair of new cotton &s;tock|ings perfectly de&s;troyed by them in one night only. Tho&s;e which frequent the e&s;tates are generally &s;mall, but very trouble&s;ome. The only way po&s;&s;ibly to keep them from the refined &s;ugar, is by hanging the loaf to the ceiling on a nail, and making a ring of dry chalk around it, very thick, which crumbles down the moment the ants attempt to pa&s;s it. I imagined that placing my &s;ugar-boxes in the middle of a tub, and on &s;tone, &s;urrounded with deep water, would have kept back this formidable enemy, but to no purpo&s;e: whole armies of the lighter &s;ort (to my a&s;toni&s;hment) marched over the &s;urface, and but a very few of them were drowned. The main body con|&s;tantly &s;caled the rock, and in &s;pite of all my efforts made their entry through the key-holes; after which, the only way to clear the garri&s;on is to expo&s;e it to a hot &s;un, which the invaders cannot bear, and all march off in a few mi|nutes. That the ants provide for winter, as not only Dr. Bancroft and many others, but even King Solo|mon, reports, is found to be an error by the mo&s;t mo|dern inve&s;tigation. In Surinam, indeed, there is no winter; but where there is, the ants lie dormant, during which torpid &s;tate they want no food.</P>
<P>My friend Captain Van Coeverden, at this time, march|ing in the woods, &s;uffered a much wor&s;e depredation at Paramaribo, where not the ants, but the negro-&s;laves, had broken open his boxes, and robbed him of all his be&s;t effects, and near twenty guineas in money.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="431">On the 6th, a marine drowned him&s;elf, in one of tho&s;e phrenzy fevers which are &s;o common in Guiana. About the &s;ame time another Society &s;oldier was &s;hot by order of a court-martial. Thus peri&s;hed tho&s;e men who were &s;pared by the climate or the enemy.</P>
<P>Having written to a Mr. Seifke, to enquire whether it was not in the power of the Governor and Council to relieve a gentleman's child from bondage, provided there was paid to its ma&s;ter &s;uch a ran&s;om as their wi&s;|dom &s;hould judge adequate; I received for an&s;wer, that no money or intere&s;t could purcha&s;e its freedom, with|out the proprietor's con&s;ent; &s;ince, according to law, it was ju&s;t as much a &s;lave as if it had been born in Africa, and imported from the coa&s;t of Guinea. This information now perfectly completed my mi&s;ery, and I at la&s;t had re|cour&s;e to drinking; which temporary relief, however, only cau&s;ed my &s;pirits to flow higher, in order to make them &s;ink lower after its evaporation. During this con|flict it happened that I was invited with the Major to dine, at an e&s;tate called Knoppemonbo, in the Ca&s;avinica Creek, where a Mr. De Graav, the proprietor, did every thing in his power to amu&s;e me, but to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;At la&s;t, &s;eeing me &s;eated by my&s;elf on a &s;mall bridge that led to a grove of orange-trees, with a &s;ettled gloom on my countenance, he acco&s;ted me, and taking me by the hand, to my a&s;to|ni&s;hment, pronounced the following words:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I am acquainted by Mr. Lolkens with the cau&s;e of your ju&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Heaven never left a good inten|tion
<PB N="363" REF="432">
unrewarded. I have now the plea&s;ure to acquaint you, that Mr. Lude has cho&s;en <HI>me</HI> for his admini&s;tra|tor; and that from this day I &s;hall pride my&s;elf in mak|ing it my bu&s;ine&s;s to render you any &s;ervice with that gentleman, as well as the virtuous Joanna, who&s;e de|&s;erving character has attracted the attention of &s;o many people, while your laudable conduct redounds to your la&s;ting honour throughout the colony."</Q></P>
<P>No angel de&s;cending from above could have brought me a more welcome me&s;&s;age; and no criminal under &s;entence of death could have received a reprieve with greater joy. The weight of a mill-&s;tone was removed from my labouring brea&s;t; and having made Mr. De Graav repeat his promi&s;e, I felt I &s;hould yet be happy. Soon after this I was &s;urrounded by &s;everal gentlemen and ladies, to whom my friend had communicated his gene|rous intentions. They congratulated me on my &s;en&s;i|bility, and on having met with &s;o valuable an acquaint|ance. All &s;eemed to partake in the plea&s;ure that I now felt; and the day being &s;pent in mirth and conviviality, I returned to the Hope, much better plea&s;ed than when I left it, where next day the whole company was enter|tained by Major Medlar; nor did we &s;eparate, or cea&s;e fea&s;ting up and down the river, till the 13th, when we once more &s;pent the day at Knoppemonbo.</P>
<P>Here Mr. De Graav, having bought &s;ome new &s;laves, gave a holiday to all the negroes on his e&s;tate; and here I had the opportunity of &s;eeing the diver&s;ions peculiar
<PB N="364" REF="433">

The&s;e dances, which are performed to the &s;ound of a drum, to which they &s;trike time by clapping of hands, may properly be con&s;idered as a kind of play or pantomime divided into &s;o many acts, which la&s;ts for &s;ome hours. But the mo&s;t remarkable is, that during this repre&s;entation, the actors, in&s;tead of being fatigued, be|come more and more enlivened and animated, till they are bathed in &s;weat like po&s;t-hor&s;es, and their pa&s;&s;ions wound up to &s;uch a degree, that nature being overcome, they are ready to drop into convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>However indelicate the above exhibitions may be, fa&s;hion has rendered them no more di&s;gu&s;ting than any other diver&s;ions to the European and Creole ladies, who in company with the gentlemen croud about them without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, to enjoy what they call a hearty laugh; while &s;uch &s;cenes would change an Engli&s;h wo|man's face from white to &s;carlet.</P>
<P>That cu&s;tom and habit give a &s;anction, and render fa|miliar, in &s;ome countries, many things which would be con&s;idered as prepo&s;terous in others, is an ob&s;ervation, which is more or le&s;s verified, in proportion to the variety

<P>On the 26th Colonel Fourgeoud marched once more to the Wana Creek; but having taken the troops from the Jew Savannah, the rebels availed them&s;elves of their ab|&s;ence, and not only pillaged a plantation in the river Surinam, but burnt &s;everal dwellings in the Creek Ca&s;a|vinica. From the above river they were bravely pur&s;ued by a feeble Society-detachment, which chanced to be there, but without &s;ucce&s;s; two &s;oldiers were killed, and Mr. Negle their leader, with &s;everal others, wounded.

repeated on December the 4th, on receiving the tidings that my Joanna was delivered of a &s;trong and beautiful boy. That very morning I di&s;patched another letter to Mr. Lude at Am&s;terdam, to obtain her manumi&s;&s;ion, couched much in the &s;ame terms as that which I had written to his predece&s;&s;or Mr. Pa&s;&s;alage, only praying for di&s;patch, as I was now uncertain how much longer the expedition was to la&s;t; in which reque&s;t I was again &s;econded by my new friend Mr. De Graav, as I had been before by Mr. Lolkens; after which I entertained the &s;ick with a dozen of old Rheni&s;h, received from the former gentleman, which had been in his cellar from one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-&s;ix.</P>
<P>Walking round the plantation the morning of the 10th with my gun, I found the whole of the &s;laves on the e&s;tate in a mutiny, on account of the cruel u&s;age inflicted by the managers: happily for all parties the interference of the military &s;oon ended this matter to mutual &s;atisfac|tion. The&s;e frequent di&s;turbances, which I have at dif|ferent times mentioned, plainly indicate the inclination of the negroes to break out in an open rebellion; and this would certainly have been more often attempted, had they not been awed by the troops. The &s;ame morning I brought home two birds, the one called <HI>toreman,</HI> the other a &s;pecies of gra&s;s-&s;nipe. The <HI>toreman,</HI> or <HI>hana|quaw,</HI> is a &s;hining black bird, as large as a pullet, with grey legs, and a bill of a dark brown colour; it is very good eating, and ea&s;ily di&s;covered in the trees (where it

perches on the highe&s;t branches) by its note repeating di&s;tinctly the word <HI>hanaquaw, hanaquaw,</HI> at the approach of any per&s;on in the fore&s;t; which has al&s;o occa&s;ioned the name of <HI>toreman,</HI> and which &s;ignifies, in the negro lan|guage of Surinam, a tale-bearer or a &s;py; on this ac|count the rebels in particular have an invincible hatred again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The gra&s;s-&s;nipe is &s;omething le&s;s than a woodcock, of a beautiful &s;ilver-grey colour, and in &s;hape much like the &s;nipes of Europe. This bird is mo&s;tly found in the wet &s;avannahs; it is very plump, and exqui&s;itely deli|cate food.</P>
<P>On the 11th the e&s;tate Rectwyk in Pirica was attacked, but the enemy was beaten back by the military.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud being now again arrived at Mag|denberg, and I at la&s;t, being perfectly recovered, after &s;even months illne&s;s, I ventured to propo&s;e, by another letter to the commander, that I might accompany him on his future excur&s;ions in the woods, or go for &s;ome time to Paramaribo; but neither the one or the other reque&s;t was yet granted. In this &s;ituation I wrote a letter to town, to inform my poor friend that I was well, with which I went to the river &s;ide to look out for a boat, and towards noon hailed the tent-barge belonging to Fauconberg, which was rowing with the over&s;eer to Paramaribo. This was, unfortunately, a new &s;uperin|tendant; and not knowing me, he refu&s;ed to come a&s;hore for the me&s;&s;age. However, &s;eeing the negroes re&s;t upon
<PB N="369" REF="438">
their oars, I took the letter in my teeth, and leaped in|&s;tantly into the river to di&s;patch it, knowing they would put me again on <HI>terra-firma.</HI> Having thus &s;wam with the &s;tream, in my &s;hirt and trow&s;ers, till I came within two oars length of the boat, I held up the letter in my hand, and called out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who the devil are you, that re|fu&s;e to take on board a piece of paper?"</Q>
When, being an&s;wered in French,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Je &s;uis Jean Bearnee, pay&s;an de Gua&s;cogne, &agrave; votre &s;ervice,"</Q>
I had the mortification to &s;ee them pull away without a po&s;&s;ibility of overtaking them, or returning. In this di&s;tre&s;s I had now nothing left but to peri&s;h, it being impo&s;&s;ible to &s;wim again&s;t the &s;tream, e&s;pecially as I was incumbered with my clothes. I &s;truggled, however, but &s;unk twice to the bottom in the attempt; and mu&s;t inevitably have been drowned, had I not caught hold of a projecting paleing that was erected in the river for the purpo&s;e of catching fi&s;h. To this I remained &s;ticking fa&s;t; when a Dutch carpenter, who ob|&s;erved me from the top of the &s;ugar-mill, called out, that the Engli&s;h captain was trying to kill him&s;elf. On this news a dozen &s;tout negroes immediately leapt into the river, and having dragged me &s;afe a&s;hore (under the direction of my good friend Medlar, who was inclined to believe the re|port) lifted me upon their &s;houlders to carry me home. The di&s;appointment, the danger, the anger, vexation, and &s;hame (for there was no contradicting them) had by this time wound up my pa&s;&s;ions to &s;uch a height, and made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my &s;pirits, that I became perfectly

mad, and had almo&s;t perpetrated the act of which I was accu&s;ed; &s;ince, on cro&s;&s;ing over a &s;mall bridge, I actually gave a &s;udden twi&s;t, and, from their &s;houlders, threw my&s;elf with a jerk headlong over the balu&s;trades once more into the water. Here a &s;econd time I was picked up by the negroes; and now the &s;u&s;picion being con|firmed that I intended &s;uicide, I was put to my ham|mock, with two &s;entinels appointed to guard me during the night, while &s;everal of my friends were &s;hedding tears around me. Having, however, drank &s;ome mulled wine, I enjoyed a &s;ound nap till morning; when appear|ing calm and perfectly compo&s;ed, my words, to my great joy, began to gain credit, and the apprehen&s;ions of my companions were di&s;pelled.&mdash;Such was the danger to which I was expo&s;ed by the unkind and inho&s;pitable behaviour of this Frenchman, who nearly obliterated the memory of this tran&s;action by his many &s;ucceeding in|&s;tances of unprecedented brutality. The following day, however, by one of my negroes and a &s;mall canoe, I &s;ent my letter to Paramaribo. Seeing now about noon a mela&s;&s;es-boat at anchor before the Hope, in which was broiling in the &s;un an Engli&s;h &s;oldier and two negroes, I made the fir&s;t come a&s;hore, and entertained the poor fellow with a bowl of punch and a good meal of eggs and bacon, to his great &s;urprize, he not having expected this kindne&s;s, or to be acco&s;ted in his own country lan|guage at this place. What were this man's grateful ac|knowledgments, who&s;e name was Charles Macdonald, will be &s;een in the &s;equel of my work.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="440">A mela&s;&s;es-boat is a barge rowed by two oars, which fetches this commodity in large hog&s;heads from the &s;ugar plantations, and delivers it on board the Engli&s;h-American ve&s;&s;els for exportation, to be di&s;tilled into rum in the i&s;lands; for which they pay the Dutch, on an average, three guineas <HI>per</HI> hog&s;head.</P>
<P>On the 16th another officer arrived from our hero un|der an arre&s;t (the fir&s;t was a Mr. Geelguin, and this was a Mr. Neys), for the crime of contending with the free negro Goa&s;ary for a bunch of plantains. Both the&s;e young men were afterwards &s;ent to Europe by Four|geoud, in expectation that they would be broke by a court-martial; but, after a very &s;hort confinement, they were honourably acquitted, to the joy of the whole corps, and the mortification of this hectoring Swi&s;s. Such was the inveteracy of this old gentleman, who had not the &s;malle&s;t con&s;ideration for the foibles of youth; and who con&s;tantly &s;aw the mote in the eye of his neighbour, over|looking the beam that appeared &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly in his own. As I have been &s;peaking of plantains, I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to give &s;ome account of a production, which, in fact, I ought to have de&s;cribed long before.</P>
<P>This is rather a plant than a tree, as the trunk has nei|ther wood nor bark, but con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;tamen enwrapped by green va&s;cular hu&s;ks, &s;ucceeding each other in the man|ner of an onion, and above ten inches in diameter. The&s;e hu&s;ks ri&s;e alternately about fourteen feet di&s;tance from the ground, and form not in branches, but in leaves, that
<PB N="372" REF="441">
&s;pread like an umbrella, about twelve or fourteen in num|ber, &s;o as to cover the talle&s;t per&s;on. They are of a &s;hining &s;ea-green till they fade, and hang down in tatters, as their places are &s;upplied by the young ones. From the centre of all this there grows a &s;trong &s;talk, about three feet long, and bending downwards by the weight of a purple &s;patha, &s;omething like a calf's heart; and on this &s;talk grows the fruit called plantains, in the &s;hape of cucumbers, and above one hundred in number, which is u&s;ually called a bunch. Each tree, or plant, bears but one of the&s;e bunches at a time. When it is cut down, it is &s;peedily &s;upplied by the young &s;hoots, which &s;pring from its bulbous root, and which in the &s;pace of ten months time are ready to undergo the &s;ame operation. It requires a rich nouri&s;hing &s;oil to make it pro&s;per, with|out which it never arrives at proper maturity. This fruit being dive&s;ted of its tegument when green, has in the in|&s;ide a pale yellow farinaceous &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;upplies (as I have already intimated) the want of bread, when either boiled or roa&s;ted: it has an agreeable ta&s;te, and is very whole&s;ome; when the &s;hell becomes yellow the in|&s;ide is &s;oft, and then may be eaten raw, having much the ta&s;te of a very ripe pear; but when arrived at that degree of maturity it is only u&s;ed by way of de&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>Another &s;pecies re&s;embling this, is the banana, which only differs from the plantain, in its fruit being le&s;s, and more oval, and this &s;pecies is never eaten till it is yellow and fully ripe. The former is mo&s;t u&s;eful in point of

<P>I now, obtaining my friend Medlar's concurrence, took a trip on the 18th to Paramaribo; where I found my boy bathing in Madeira wine and water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however uncommon it may appear to an European, is often practi&s;ed in Surinam by &s;uch as can afford it; among&s;t which cla&s;s was the ho&s;pitable Mrs. Lolkens, who generou&s;ly pre&s;ented Joanna with the wine.</NOTE>, while his mother was happy, and perfectly recovered.

<P>The poor negro whom I had &s;ent before me with a letter had been le&s;s fortunate than I was, having his canoe over&s;et in the middle of the river Surinam, by the roughne&s;s of the water. With great addre&s;s, however, he kept him&s;elf in an erect po&s;ture (for this man could not &s;wim), and by the buoyancy and re&s;i&s;tance of the boat
<PB N="374" REF="444">
again&s;t his feet, he was enabled ju&s;t to keep his head above the water, while the weight of his body kept the &s;unk canoe from moving. In this precarious attitude, he was picked up by a man-of-war's boat; who, taking away the canoe for their trouble, put him on &s;hore at Parama|ribo. He kept the letter, however &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;till in his mouth, and being eager to deliver it, he accidentally ran into a wrong hou&s;e; where, being taken for a thief (for refu&s;ing to let them read it), he was tied up to receive four hundred la&s;hes; but, fortunately, was reprieved by the interce&s;&s;ion of an Engli&s;h merchant of the name of Gordon, who was my particular friend, and knew the negro.

<P>Having on the 23d dined at the e&s;tate Knoppemonbo, I will al&s;o mention two birds, which attracted my particular attention. The one on account of the very great pecu|liarity of its ne&s;t; it is called in this country <HI>lipee-banana,</HI> as &s;uppo&s;ed to feed much on the ripe bananas. Whether this is the mock-bird of Dr. Bancroft, I know not, but in &s;ome particulars it approaches his de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds that I &s;peak of had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large tree near the water-&s;ide, which the negroes told me they had frequented undi&s;turbed for many years; they were at lea&s;t above two hundred in number, about the &s;ize of Engli&s;h thru&s;hes, &s;ome were a &s;hining black, with the tails and part of the wings of a bright crim&s;on; the others were al&s;o black, but their tails and wings of a fine yellow colour. The fir&s;t I was informed were the
<PB N="376" REF="446">
males, and the latter the females of the &s;ame &s;pecies: they indeed whi&s;tled a variety of notes, but neither had that melody or imitation of other &s;ong&s;ters, which is &s;o gene|rally a&s;cribed to the mock-bird, and which, be&s;ides, I never heard mentioned in Surinam. The&s;e birds had their ne&s;ts (above three&s;core in number) fixed to the extremity of the branches, where they were dangling in the wind, re&s;embling egg-nets &s;tuffed with hay, of which, indeed, they were built; and about the middle of them there was a &s;mall hole, at which the birds enter and go out. The bottom is built wide, and perfectly round; there they lay their eggs, and hatch their young ones, while the &s;piral roof protects them from birds of prey, and from the weather. But what is of more con&s;equence, the monkeys, which are &s;o numerous in this country, are, by &s;uch a &s;ituation, prevented from de&s;troying them, &s;ince the branches or twigs from which they depend, though &s;trong enough to &s;upport the ne&s;ts, and what is in them, are too weak to bear the load of more weighty invaders; and, for greater &s;ecurity, I may add, they are mo&s;tly built depending over water.&mdash;<HI>(See the ne&s;ts in Plate</HI> XLV.) The other bird which I &s;hot in returning home, was the Surinam falcon or hawk. Its &s;ize and &s;hape was like tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pecies in England: its colour light brown, variegated on the brea&s;t and tail with &s;pecks of red, black, and yellow; its tongue was cloven, its eyes remark|ably bright, its legs a citron colour, and its talons armed with long and &s;harp-pointed claws. This bird is exceed|ingly

<P>But I mu&s;t once more return to the operations of our commander in chief, who having re&s;ted a few days at Magdenberg, again marched, on Chri&s;tmas-day, with the remaining handful of his men, to the Jew Savan|nah, whence he returned (having &s;een nothing) back to Magdenberg, with the new title of being him&s;elf the wandering Jew. This did not prevent me and Major Medlar from renewing our &s;olicitations to ac|company him in his expeditions; but we were &s;till pre|vented by his going to town, where about this time a fre&s;h &s;upply of troops was hourly expected to arrive from Europe. At la&s;t, however, he gave me leave to follow him, with &s;ome other officers who were actually in want, at a time when fifteen hog&s;heads of fine claret, and fifteen thou&s;and florins in &s;pecie, were waiting his commands at Paramaribo.</P>

<P>In the evening I rowed to Paramaribo with the ebb tide, which gave me an opportunity of &s;eeing the man|groves that line the banks of the river Surinam full of oy&s;ters, &s;tuck in the branches like fruit, from the water's edge up to high-water mark. The&s;e oy&s;ters attaching
<PB N="379" REF="449">
them&s;elves to trees as they do to rocks, has given ri&s;e to the vulgar error that they grow, or vegetate like fruit; but it is not more extraordinary that they &s;hould &s;tick on any one &s;ub&s;tance than on another, for many &s;pecies of &s;hell-fi&s;h are as commonly found to adhere to &s;hips' bottoms as to rocks. The&s;e oy&s;ters, which at &s;ome di&s;|tance look like mu&s;hrooms, are, indeed, very &s;mall and trifling; for one hundred are not comparable to one dozen that come from Colche&s;ter. In Surinam are al&s;o a kind of mu&s;cles, but the&s;e are &s;o &s;mall and in&s;ipid, that they are &s;carcely worthy of mention.</P>
<P>The day after my arrival I vi&s;ited the governor: as al&s;o Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Lolkens, Mrs. De Melley, &amp;c. who all congratulated me on my acquaintance with Mr. De Graav, and highly honoured me, and approved of what I had done for my Mulatto and her infant.</P>
<P>On the 22d, our few remaining troops being mo&s;tly at Paramaribo, a Mr. Van Eys gave an entertainment to the whole corps.</P>
<P>On the 25th a great number of Indians, or natives, ar|rived at Paramaribo; which afforded me an opportunity of &s;eeing and de&s;cribing this people, who are the aborigines of the country. The&s;e Indians, who appear the happie&s;t creatures under the &s;un, are divided into many ca&s;ts or tribes, &s;uch as the

be&s;ides which, there are many others who&s;e manners are unknown to us. All the&s;e tribes of Indians are in gene|ral of a copper-colour; while the negroes of Africa, that live under the &s;ame degree of latitude, are perfectly black. This, however inconceivable it may appear, is ea&s;ily ac|counted for, when one con&s;iders, fir&s;t, that the American In|dians in Guiana are con&s;tantly refre&s;hed by the cooling &s;ea breeze, or ea&s;terly wind, that blows between the tropics; and that tho&s;e who dwell in Terra-Firma and Peru, on the We&s;t coa&s;t, enjoy that &s;ame ea&s;terly breeze, &s;till kept cool by the great chain of inland mountains over which it pa&s;&s;es, and which have their &s;ummits perpetually covered with &s;now. While the inhabitants of Africa, &s;outh of the river Senegal, get the &s;ame ea&s;t wind rather heated than cooled, by the prodigious quantity of inland, hot, &s;andy de&s;erts over which it pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t probable rea&s;ons why the Americans are of a copper-colour or red, and the inhabitants of Africa, called Negroes, are black, <HI>viz.</HI> the one being more burnt by the &s;un than the other, and not becau&s;e they are two di&s;tinct races of people: &s;ince no per&s;on who examines and reflects, can avoid &s;eeing that there is but one race of people on the earth, who differ from each other only according to the &s;oil and the climate in which they live. I am further of opinion, that the&s;e aborigines, or In|dian natives, will appear to have &s;till le&s;s title to be called a di&s;tinct people from tho&s;e of the old continent, when we con&s;ider the proximity of Ru&s;&s;ia to North America,

<P>For my part I mu&s;t &s;ay, with Socrates, that this kind of poverty is alone the true&s;t kind of riches; as tho&s;e who want lea&s;t approach neare&s;t to the gods, who want no|thing.
<PB N="382" REF="453">
This naturally leads me to the &s;peech of an In|dian, in reply to a &s;ermon preached by a Swedi&s;h mini&s;ter at an Indian treaty, held at Cove&s;togue, of which the principal &s;ub&s;tance was as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do you then really believe, that we and our fore-fathers are all, as you would teach us, condemned to &s;uffer eternal torments in another world, becau&s;e we have not been taught your my&s;terious novelties? Are we not the work of God? And can the Almighty not manife&s;t his will without the help of a book? If this is true, and God is ju&s;t, then how is it con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice to force life upon us without our con&s;ent, and then to condemn us all to eternal damnation, becau&s;e we did not meet with you. No, Sir, we are convinced that the Chri&s;tians are more depraved in their morals than we Indians, if we may judge of their doctrines by the general badne&s;s of their lives."</Q></P>
<P>There cannot indeed be a more laudable undertaking, than the endeavour to engraft divine truths on the pure minds of the&s;e innocent people, &s;o worthy of in&s;truc|tion; but I fear, and it is too ob&s;ervable, that the words of one good man will have but little effect, when the practice of the far greater number of Moravian preachers &s;ettled among&s;t them on the banks of the Sera|mica rivers, where they endeavour to convert the negroes as well as the Indians, is in direct contradiction to his life and precepts.</P>
<P>All the Guiana Indians believe in God as the &s;upreme
<PB N="383" REF="454">
author of every good, and never inclined to do them an injury; but they wor&s;hip the devil, whom they call <HI>Yawahoo,</HI> to prevent his afflicting them with evil, and to whom they a&s;cribe pain, di&s;ea&s;e, wounds, and death; and where an Indian dies, in order to avert future fata|lity, the whole family, &s;oon after, leave the &s;pot as a place of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>The Guiana Indians are a perfectly free people, that is, they have no divi&s;ion of land, and are without any go|vernment, excepting that in mo&s;t families the olde&s;t acts as captain, prie&s;t, and phy&s;ician, to whom they pay a re|verential obedience: the&s;e men are called <HI>Peii</HI> or <HI>Pa|gayers,</HI> and, as in &s;ome civilized nations, live better than all others.</P>
<P>Polygamy is admitted among them, and ever In|dian is allowed to take as many wives as he can pro|vide for, though he generally takes but one, of whom he is extremely jealous, and whom he knocks on the head the moment he receives a decided proof of her incontinency. The&s;e Indians never beat their chil|dren on any account whatever, nor give them any edu|cation, except in hunting, fi&s;hing, running, and &s;wim|ming; yet they never u&s;e abu&s;ive language to each other, nor &s;teal; and a lye is totally unknown among them. To which I may add, that no people can be more grateful when treated with civility, of which I &s;hall in future relate a remarkable in&s;tance: but I mu&s;t not for|get that, on the other hand, they are extremely revenge|ful,
<PB N="384" REF="455">
e&s;pecially when, as they &s;uppo&s;e, they are injured without ju&s;t provocation.</P>
<P>The only vices with which to my knowledge they are acquainted, if &s;uch among&s;t them they may be called, are exce&s;&s;ive drinking when opportunity offers, and an un|accountable indolence: an Indian's only occupation, when he is not hunting or fi&s;hing, being to lounge in his ham|mock, picking his teeth, plucking the hairs from his beard, examining his face in a bit of broken looking-gla&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Indians in general are a very cleanly people, bath|ing twice or thrice every day in the river, or the &s;ea. They have all thick hair, which never turns grey, and the head never becomes bald; both &s;exes pluck out every ve&s;tige of hair on their bodies, that on the head only excepted: it is of a &s;hining black, which the men wear &s;hort, but the women very long, hanging over the back and &s;houlders to their middle; as if they had &s;tudied the &s;criptures, where it is &s;aid that long hair is an ornament to a woman, but a di&s;grace to a man.</P>
<P>The Guiana Indians are neither tall, &s;trong, nor mu&s;|cular: but they are &s;traight, active, and generally in a good &s;tate of health. Their faces have no expre&s;|&s;ion whatever, that of a placid good-nature and con|tent excepted; and their features are beautifully re|gular, with &s;mall black eyes, thin lips, and very white teeth. However, all the Guiana Indians disfigure them|&s;elves more or le&s;s by the u&s;e of arnotta or rocow, by
<PB N="385" REF="456">
them called <HI>co&s;owee,</HI> and by the Dutch <HI>orlean.</HI> The &s;eeds of the arnotta being macerated in the juice of lemon, and mixed with water, and gum that exudes from the <HI>mawna</HI> tree, or with the oil of ca&s;tor, com|po&s;es a &s;carlet paint, with which all the Indians anoint their bodies, and even the men their hair, which gives their &s;kin the appearance of a boiled lob&s;ter; they al&s;o rub their naked bodies with <HI>caraba</HI> or crab-oil. This, it mu&s;t be allowed, is extremely u&s;eful in &s;corching cli|mates, where the inhabitants of both &s;exes go almo&s;t naked. One day, laughing at a young man who came from the neighbourhood of Cayenne, he an&s;wered me in French, &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My &s;kin, &s;ir, is kept &s;oft, too great per&s;piration is prevented, and the mu&s;quitoes do not &s;ting me as they do you: be&s;ides its beauty, this is the u&s;e of my painting red. Now what is the rea|&s;on of your painting white?"</Q>
[meaning powder in the hair]
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are, without any rea&s;on, wa&s;ting your flour, dirtying your coat, and making your&s;elf look grey be|fore your time."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Indians al&s;o make u&s;e of a deep purple blue, which they call <HI>tapowripa</HI>; but this is purely for or|nament, and is ab&s;olutely indelible for about nine days. It is the juice of a fruit in &s;ize like a &s;mall apple that grows on the <HI>lawna</HI> tree, and which is brui&s;ed and macerated in water. With this the&s;e people make figures on their faces, and all over their bodies, re&s;embling hie|roglyphicks, like tho&s;e that were a few years &s;ince called
<PB N="386" REF="457">
<HI>&agrave; la Grec</HI> in Europe, and are &s;till cut in coal-grates, fenders, &amp;c. But for a more correct idea I mu&s;t refer the reader to the annexed plate, where the children alone are not painted. So very permanently does this paint adhere to the &s;kin, that one of our officers, who could not be|lieve the fact, having by way of a frolic made a pair of enormous whi&s;kers with it on his face, was obliged, to our great amu&s;ement, to parade Paramaribo with them for above a week, and wait till they gradually di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The only dre&s;s worn by the&s;e Indians con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;lip of black or blue cotton worn by the men to cover their nakedne&s;s, and called <HI>cami&s;a</HI>; &s;omething like that of the negroes. Being wound round their loins, it pa&s;&s;es through between their thighs, and the ends of it, which are very long, they either throw over their &s;houlders, or negligently let them trail on the ground. For the &s;ame purpo&s;e, the women wear an apron of cotton, with party-coloured gla&s;s beads &s;trung upon it, which they call <HI>queiou.</HI> This covering is of no great &s;ize, being only about one foot in breadth by eight inches in length, ornamented with fringes, and fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t with cotton &s;trings; but being heavy, though of no larger dimen&s;ions, it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es for which it was intended. Many al&s;o wear a girdle made of human hair round their wai&s;t, through which, before and behind, they fa&s;ten a &s;quare broad piece of black cotton, but lighter, and without a train, like the cami&s;a of the men: both &s;exes wearing the&s;e belts or girdles &s;o low, that they
<PB N="387" REF="458">
almo&s;t &s;lide down over their buttocks, and make their bodies appear wonderfully long.</P>
<P>In the inland parts, many Indians of both &s;exes go quite naked, without any covering whatever. The Indian wo|men al&s;o, by way of ornament, often cut &s;mall holes in their ears and their lips, in the fir&s;t of which they wear corks or &s;mall pieces of light wood, and through their lips they &s;tick thorns, and &s;ometimes all the pins they can lay hold of, with the heads in&s;ide again&s;t the gums, and the points like a beard dangling down upon their chins. Some wear feathers through their cheeks and through their no&s;es, though this is but &s;eldom. But the mo&s;t unac|countable ornament in my opinion is, that the girls at ten or twelve years old work a kind of cotton garter round their ankles, and the &s;ame below the knee; which being very tight, and remaining for ever, occa&s;ions their calves to &s;well to an enormous &s;ize by the time they are grown women, and gives their limbs a very odd and unnatural appearance. They al&s;o wear girdles, bands, and bracelets, of various coloured beads, &s;hells, and fi&s;h|teeth, about their necks, acro&s;s their &s;houlders, or round their arms, but generally above the elbow. Upon the whole, the Indian women, naturally di&s;agreeable in their &s;hapes, with their toes turned inwards, are &s;till le&s;s attractive by their ornaments. But from this gene|neral de&s;cription I mu&s;t exempt one ca&s;t in particular, called <HI>Arrowouks,</HI> whom I &s;hall de&s;cribe in their proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="459">The ornaments of the men con&s;i&s;t of crowns of va|rious coloured feathers, or a &s;a&s;h of boars or tygers teeth acro&s;s one &s;houlder, as a token of their valour and acti|vity. The chiefs of families &s;ometimes wear the &s;kin of a tyger, and a &s;ilver plate re&s;embling a croi&s;&s;ant, called by them a <HI>caracoly</HI>; they al&s;o frequently have &s;mall oval bits of &s;ilver in the cartilaginous &s;eparation of their no&s;es, and &s;ometimes a green or yellow coloured &s;tone. All the&s;e nations live in the fore&s;t, near rivers, and along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, where they are &s;cattered in &s;mall villages or hamlets. Their hou&s;es or wigwams, which they call <HI>car|bets,</HI> are built as I have already de&s;cribed tho&s;e of the ne|groes; but in&s;tead of being covered with the leaves of the manicole-tree, they are covered with the leaves of rattans or jointed canes, here called <HI>tas,</HI> which grow in clu&s;ters in all mar&s;hy places: but they mo&s;tly u&s;e <HI>troolies,</HI> which are leaves that diverge immediately from the root, and are no le&s;s than twenty or twenty-four feet in length, and from two to three in breadth, and this will for years ef|fectually exclude all inclemencies of weather.</P>
<P>Their furniture is very &s;imple, but &s;ufficient for their wants, con&s;i&s;ting of a few black earthen pots of their own making; a few calleba&s;hes or gourds; a few ba&s;kets, called <HI>pagala</HI>; a &s;tone to grind, called <HI>matta,</HI> and another to bake their ca&s;&s;ava bread; a fan to blow the fire; a wooden &s;tool or <HI>mulee</HI>; a &s;ieve they call <HI>manary</HI>; a pre&s;s to &s;queeze the wet ca&s;&s;ava, called <HI>matappy</HI>; and a cotton hammock or net for them to &s;leep in.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="460">Be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ince their intercour&s;e with the Eu|ropeans, many of them are furni&s;hed with a hatchet and a knife, which la&s;t, like a dagger, the Indians always wear by their &s;ide. But I mu&s;t not forget that every In|dian family is provided with a large boat or canoe to carry all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s when they travel by water, which is not unfrequent.</P>
<P>The only vegetables cultivated by the&s;e people are the yams, plantains, and bananas, already de&s;cribed, and particularly <HI>ca&s;&s;ava</HI> and <HI>manioc.</HI> This la&s;t is a &s;hrub, which grows about three feet high, of a grey colour, and knotted; the leaves are digitated and large, and &s;upported by cinnamon-coloured foot-&s;talks. Of this &s;hrub there are two &s;pecies, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appel|lation of the &s;weet and the bitter ca&s;&s;ava, of which the roots alone are for u&s;e. The&s;e are &s;oft and farinaceous; and in colour, &s;ize, and &s;hape, much re&s;emble European par&s;nips. The &s;weet ca&s;&s;ava, roa&s;ted in hot a&s;hes, like the green plantains, and eaten with butter, is an agree|able and healthy food, ta&s;ting much like the che&s;nut. But the bitter ca&s;&s;ava, which when raw is the mo&s;t fatal poi&s;on both to man and bea&s;t, is (however &s;trange it may &s;eem) when prepared by fire, not only a very &s;afe food, but the mo&s;t natural bread of the Indians in this coun|try, as well as of &s;everal Europeans and negroes. The manner in which the Indians prepare it is fir&s;t by grind|ing or grating the&s;e roots on the matta or rough &s;tone:
<PB N="390" REF="461">
after which they put it in a pre&s;s, to &s;eparate the juice from the meal. This pre&s;s is a kind of long tube, made of <HI>warimbo</HI> or reeds; which being hung to a tree, and filled with ground ca&s;&s;ava, a heavy &s;tone or log of wood is fixed to the bottom, the weight of which gradually length|ens the tube, which is compre&s;&s;ed in proportion, and the liquid &s;ub&s;tance is &s;queezed through the plated reeds. This done, the meal is baked on a hot &s;tone in thin round cakes, until it becomes brown and cri&s;p, and then it is a whole|&s;ome food, that will keep good for half a year; yet I mu&s;t acknowledge that the ta&s;te, which by that proce&s;s becomes &s;weeti&s;h, is at the &s;ame time extremely in&s;ipid. The extracted water of this root, if not carefully prevented by the &s;laves, is &s;ometimes drunk by cattle and poultry on the e&s;tates, whom it in&s;tantly kills with convul&s;ive tortures and &s;welling; yet this very liquid, if boiled with pepper, butcher's meat, &amp;c. is frequently made u&s;e of for &s;oup. None &s;hould u&s;e the ca&s;&s;ava root for food but &s;uch as are perfectly acquainted with it: many peo|ple having been poi&s;oned, to my knowledge, by u&s;ing the one &s;pecies for the other; the di&s;tinction between the two con&s;i&s;ting chiefly in a tough ligneous fibre or cord running through the heart of the &s;weet or innocent ca&s;&s;ava root, which the fatal or bitter has not. The <HI>acajou</HI> nuts are al&s;o u&s;ed by the Indians; and they often bring them to Paramaribo, where they are called <HI>inginotto.</HI> The kernels of the&s;e nuts are in &s;ize and &s;hape very like
<PB N="391" REF="462">
lambs kidneys, and are exceedingly delicate. They grow very far inland upon high trees, which having never &s;een, I cannot de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The other food of the Indian con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ea and land turtle, and crabs, called <HI>&s;eereeca,</HI> which la&s;t are &s;een in great quantities in the mud all along the coa&s;t of Guiana at low water. Of the&s;e they are extremely fond, as al&s;o of the river lob&s;ters called <HI>&s;ara&s;ara,</HI> which are here in great abundance. But nothing plea&s;es them &s;o much as the <HI>iguana</HI> or <HI>wayamacca</HI> lizards, that I have already de&s;cribed: every thing they eat is &s;o highly &s;ea&s;oned with Cayenne pepper, that the mere ta&s;ting of their food excoriates the mouth of an European. They u&s;e little or no &s;alt, but barbacue their game and fi&s;h in the &s;moke, which equally pre&s;erves it from putre|faction; and if an Indian has neglected to provide food by hunting or fi&s;hing, his hunger is a&s;&s;waged by eating the &s;eeds of the <HI>green-heart</HI> or the <HI>eta</HI> tree, or of &s;imilar productions of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Their drink con&s;i&s;ts of various fluids, &s;uch as the juice of the <HI>coumoo</HI> fruit. The <HI>coumoo</HI> tree is one of the &s;malle&s;t of the palm kind. Its &s;eed grows in bunches of purple blue berries, re&s;embling grapes, the pulp of which thinly adheres to a round hard &s;tone, about the &s;ize of a pi&s;tol bullet. The&s;e berries are di&s;|&s;olved and macerated in boiling water; which beverage, when mixed with &s;ugar and cinnamon, is frequently u&s;ed by the fair inhabitants: it ta&s;tes very much like cho|colate.
<PB N="392" REF="463">
A drink they call <HI>piworree</HI> is a compo&s;ition of the ca&s;&s;ava bread, chewed by the females, and fermented with water, when it has &s;omething of the ta&s;te of ale, and will intoxicate. It appears at fir&s;t very extraordinary, that what has been within the teeth, mixed with the &s;a|liva, and &s;pit from the mouths of others, &s;hould be drank without loathing by the people of any country: but tho&s;e who have read Cook's Voyages will find that this practice was &s;o common in the i&s;lands he di&s;covered, that had he not complied with it, his refu&s;al might have fatally offended the inhabitants. His officers, indeed, did not think it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for them to comply, and therefore excu&s;ed them&s;elves from the di&s;gu&s;ting draught. A beverage nearly of the &s;ame kind they compo&s;e from the maize, or Indian corn, which is fir&s;t ground and baked into bread, after which it is crumbled and macerated with water till it ferments like the former, and this they call <HI>chiacoar.</HI> Another drink called <HI>ca&s;&s;iree</HI> is al&s;o much u&s;ed by the&s;e Indians, being a compo&s;ition of yams, ca&s;&s;ava, &s;our oranges, and &s;ugar or treacle, well macerated, and fermented with water. I &s;hall only add, that all the&s;e beverages are inebriating, if u&s;ed be|yond moderation, which is frequently the ca&s;e with both males and females among the copper-coloured generation I am &s;peaking of. This is the only time when they are unruly, and when quarrels ari&s;e among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In pronunciation the language of the Indians in general much re&s;embles the Italian, their words being &s;onorous
<PB N="393" REF="464">
and harmonious, mo&s;tly terminating with a vowel, as may be ob&s;erved by the few &s;pecimens above. They have no calculation of time, a &s;tring with &s;ome knots be|ing the only calendar they are acquainted with. Their mu&s;ical in&s;truments con&s;i&s;t of a kind of flute called <HI>too-too,</HI> and made of a &s;ingle piece of thick reed, on which they make a &s;ound no better than the lowing of an ox, without either mea&s;ure or variety.&mdash;Another in&s;tru|ment is al&s;o u&s;ed by them to blow upon, called <HI>quarta</HI> (by Ovid a <HI>&s;irinx</HI>; by &s;ome poets <HI>Pan's chaunter)</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts of reeds of different lengths, that are joined to|gether like the pipes of an organ, but even at the top, which they hold with both hands to the lips, and which, by &s;hifting from &s;ide to &s;ide, produces a warbling of clear but di&s;cordant &s;ounds, agreeable to none but them&s;elves; nor have I &s;een a better repre&s;entation of the god Pan playing on his chaunter, than a naked Indian among the verdant foliage playing upon one of tho&s;e reedy pipes. They al&s;o make flutes of the bones of their enemies, of which I have one now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Their dancing, if &s;uch it may be called, con&s;i&s;ts in &s;tamping on the ground, balancing on one foot, and &s;taggering round in different attitudes for many hours, as if intoxicated.</P>
<P>The Indians are a very &s;ociable people among them|&s;elves, and frequently meet together in a large wigwam or carbet that is in every hamlet for the purpo&s;e, where, if they do not play or dance, they amu&s;e each other with fictitious &s;tories, generally concerning gho&s;ts, witches,
<PB N="394" REF="465">
or dreams, during which they frequently bur&s;t out into immoderate fits of laughter. They greatly delight in bathing, which they do twice at lea&s;t every day, men, women, boys, and girls, promi&s;cuou&s;ly together. They are all excellent &s;wimmers without exception. Among the&s;e parties not the &s;malle&s;t indecency is committed, in either words or actions.</P>
<P>The employments of the men are, as I have &s;tated, but very few, and, indeed, may be comprized in two words, hunting and fi&s;hing: at both of the&s;e exerci&s;es they are indi&s;putably more expert than any other nation what|ever. For the fir&s;t they are provided with bows and arrows of their own manufacturing, the arrows being of different kinds for different purpo&s;es. The Indian bows are all made of the harde&s;t and toughe&s;t kind of wood, about five or &s;ix feet in length, and won|derfully well poli&s;hed; and this is effected by means of a &s;tone. In the middle they are wound round with cotton, and &s;trung with chords made of &s;ilk-gra&s;s. The arrows are generally about four feet long, made of a very &s;traight and &s;trong kind of reed, to the end of which is fixed a thin twig about one foot long, to balance them; this is armed with a point made of &s;teel or of fi&s;h-bone, generally barbed. Some of the Indian arrows are pointed like a lance, others are doubly and trebly barbed, and &s;o contrived as to &s;tick in the wound when the reedy part is pulled back. The&s;e are u&s;ed mo&s;tly for game and fi&s;h; for though they be not mortal,
<PB N="395" REF="466">
they encumber the fir&s;t, and being buoyant bring the latter to the &s;urface, till both are taken. The&s;e arrows, like all others, are &s;tuck with feathers &s;ix or &s;even inches long. Some arrows have blunted heads in&s;tead of points, about the &s;ize of a large che&s;nut, like what our ance&s;tors called bols; with the&s;e they do not kill, but &s;tun the macaws, parrots, and &s;mall monkeys, &s;o that they can take them with their hands, &s;oon after which they reco|ver, and are &s;ent alive to Paramaribo. Some of the ar|rows for killing fi&s;h have the appearance of a trident, three and &s;ometimes five barbed &s;ticks being fixed to the reed in&s;tead of one, which enables them to &s;hoot fi&s;h even at random. A few of the above arrows are fre|quently dipped in the <HI>woorara</HI> poi&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bark of a tree &s;o called, mixed with others; but for a very particular de|&s;cription of this acute poi&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> of its compo&s;ition, and of its dire effects, I refer the reader to Dr. Bancroft, and the repeated experiments which that gentle|man has made to a&s;certain its in&s;tant fa|tality.</NOTE>, which is in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly fatal: but when intent on certain de|&s;truction, this people make u&s;e of another kind of arrow that is not above ten or twelve inches long, extremely thin, and made of the hard &s;plinters of the palm-tree bark, having, in&s;tead of feathers, one end wound round with a tuft of raw cotton, &s;o as to fill up a hollow tube made of reed near &s;ix feet in length, through which they blow them with their breath. The&s;e little implements of death will carry to the di&s;tance of forty paces, and with &s;o much certainty, that the intended
<PB N="396" REF="467">
victims never e&s;cape, the points being dipped in the <HI>woorara</HI> poi&s;on. As an in&s;tance of the dreadful effects of this poi&s;on, I &s;hall only mention a negro woman, who, during the late rebellion in Berbice, being &s;lightly wounded by a poi&s;oned arrow, not only almo&s;t in&s;tantly expired, but her &s;ucking infant, though not touched by the arrow, lo&s;t its life by ta&s;ting her milk.</P>
<P>Their manner of catching fi&s;h is much the &s;ame as I have de&s;cribed at the Hope, by inclo&s;ing the entry of &s;mall creeks or &s;hoal water with a paleing, &s;hooting them with their trident arrows, or poi&s;oning the water by throwing in it the roots of <HI>hiaree</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This tree is much &s;ought after by the Indians, who &s;end quantities of it to Paramaribo and the plantations.</NOTE>, in Surinam called <HI>tringee-woodo</HI> or <HI>konamee,</HI> by which they float become &s;tupified, and are taken by the hand, while they float on the &s;urface of the water; as boys in England, who by mixing the <HI>Coculus Indicus,</HI> or drugs of &s;imilar effect, with baits which the fi&s;h will take, find them &s;oon after ri&s;e to the &s;urface, whence, if they are not &s;peedily taken, they will recover and e&s;cape, the drugs only &s;tupifying them for a while. The&s;e are the only occupations of the men, except making their furniture, ornaments, and arms.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget that every Indian carries a club, which they call <HI>apootoo,</HI> for their defence. The&s;e clubs are made of the heavie&s;t wood in the fore&s;t; they are
<PB N="397" REF="468">
about eighteen inches long, flat at both ends, and &s;quare, but heavier at the one end than the other. In the mid|dle they are thinner, and are wound about with &s;trong cotton threads, &s;o as to be gra&s;ped, having a loop to &s;ecure them round the wri&s;t, as the &s;word-ta&s;&s;els are u&s;ed by &s;ome cavalry. One blow with this club, in which is frequently fixed a &s;harp &s;tone, &s;catters the brains. They are u&s;ed by the Guiana Indians like the tomahawk by the Cherokees, on which, be&s;ides other hieroglyphical figures, they often carve the number of per&s;ons they have &s;lain in battle. The manner of fixing the &s;tone in the club or apootoo is by &s;ticking it in the tree while it is yet growing, where it &s;oon becomes &s;o fa&s;t that it cannot be forced out; after which the wood is cut, and &s;haped according to fancy.</P>
<P>The women are occupied in planting ca&s;&s;ava, plan|tains, and other roots, be&s;ides yams, &amp;c. in dre&s;&s;ing the victuals, and in making earthen pots, bracelets, ba&s;kets, or cotton hammocks. Their be&s;t ba&s;kets are called <HI>pagala,</HI> and are formed of a double matting of ru&s;hes called <HI>warimbo,</HI> &s;ome white, &s;ome brown, be|tween which is a &s;eparation of <HI>tas,</HI> or trooly-leaves, to keep out the wet. The covering is u&s;ually larger and deeper than the ba&s;ket it&s;elf, which it altogether envelopes, and thus makes it &s;tronger; the whole re&s;t|ing on two cro&s;s pieces of wood fixed to the bottom. Their hammocks are woven, which mu&s;t require a con&s;iderable portion of time and trouble, being done
<PB N="398" REF="469">
thread after thread, traver&s;ing the warp in the manner that a hole is darned in a &s;tocking; after which they are &s;tained with the juices of trees according to fancy.</P>
<P>The Indian girls arrive at the time of puberty before twelve years old, indeed commonly much &s;ooner, at which time they are married. The ceremony con&s;i&s;ts &s;imply in the young man's offering a quantity of game and fi&s;h of his own catching, which, if &s;he accepts, he next propo&s;es the que&s;tion, "Will you be my wife?" If &s;he an&s;wers in the affirmative, the matter is &s;ettled, and the nuptials celebrated in a drunken fea&s;t, when a hou&s;e and furniture is provided for the young couple. Their women are delivered without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and with &s;o little inconvenience or &s;uffering, that they &s;eem exempt from the cur&s;e of Eve. They go about the menial &s;er|vices for their hu&s;bands the day after their delivery; then, however ridiculous and incredible it may appear, it is an ab&s;olute fact, that every one of the&s;e gentlemen lie in their hammocks for above a month, groaning and grunting as if they had been them&s;elves in labour, dur|ing which time all the women mu&s;t attend them with extraordinary care and the be&s;t food. This the Indian calls enjoying him&s;elf, and re&s;ting from his labour. Mo&s;t of the&s;e people e&s;teeming a flat forehead a mark of beauty, they compre&s;s the heads of their children, it is &s;aid, immediately after their birth, like the Chactaws of North America.</P>
<P>No Indian wife eats with her hu&s;band, but &s;erves him
<PB N="399" REF="470">
as a &s;lave: for this rea&s;on they can take but very little care of their infants, which, neverthele&s;s, are always healthy and undeformed. When they travel, they carry them in &s;mall hammocks &s;lung over one &s;houlder, in which &s;its the child, having one leg before and the other behind the mother. For an emetic they u&s;e the juice of tobacco, which they &s;eldom &s;moke.</P>
<P>When the Indians are dying, either from &s;ickne&s;s or old age, the latter of which is mo&s;t frequently the cau&s;e, the devil or <HI>Yawahoo</HI> is at midnight exorci&s;ed by the <HI>peii</HI> or prie&s;t, by means of rattling a caliba&s;h filled with &s;mall &s;tones, peas, and beads, accompanied by a long &s;peech. This office is hereditary, and by the&s;e pretended di|vines no animal food, as I have before &s;aid, is publicly ta&s;ted, and yet on the whole they live better than all the others. When an Indian is dead, being fir&s;t wa&s;hed and anointed, he is buried naked, in a new cotton bag, in a &s;itting attitude, his head re&s;ting on the palms of his hands, his elbows on his knees, and all his implements of war and hunting by his &s;ide; during which time his relations and neighbours rend the air by their di&s;|mal lamentations; but &s;oon after, by a general drunken riot, they drown their &s;orrows till the following year. This practice, by the way, bears&s;ome affinity to Dr. Smollet's de&s;cription of a burial in the Highlands of Scotland. At the expiration of the year, the body, being rotten, is dug up, and the bones di&s;tributed to all the friends and ac|quaintance, during which ceremony the former rites
<PB N="400" REF="471">
are repeated for the la&s;t time, and the whole neighbour|hood look out for another &s;ettlement. Some tribes of Indians, having put their decea&s;ed friends in the above po&s;ture, place them naked for a few days under water, where the bones being picked clean by the <HI>piree</HI> and other fi&s;h, the &s;keleton is dried in the &s;un, and hung up to the ceiling of their hou&s;es or wigwams; and this is done as the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance of their great regard for their departed friend.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Indians travel by land, their canoe, which is made of a large tree hollowed by means of fire, is al|ways carried along with them to tran&s;port their luggage acro&s;s &s;wamps, creeks, and rivers; it is, like them&s;elves, all over be&s;meared with arnotta. If they travel in the rivers, they generally paddle again&s;t the tide, to have a better opportunity of &s;hooting &s;uch game as they &s;ee in the trees or on the banks; whereas, if they went with the current, the rapidity of the &s;tream would often make them run pa&s;t it. When travelling on the coa&s;t, it fre|quently happens that the&s;e canoes &s;hip a &s;ea which fills them, but no &s;uch thing as a &s;hipwreck is heard of: both &s;exes immediately leaping over-board; then with one hand they hang by the canoe, with the other, and by means of caliba&s;hes, they throw out the water.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Guiana Indians are upon the whole a peaceable people, they &s;ometimes go to war among them&s;elves, purely for the &s;ake of capturing pri|&s;oners, to which they are too much encouraged by the
<PB N="401" REF="472">
Chri&s;tians, who receive them in exchange for other commodities, and make them &s;laves, which is too fre|quently practi&s;ed. But the&s;e kind of &s;laves are only for &s;hew and parade, as they ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to work, and if at all ill-treated, or e&s;pecially if beaten, they pine and langui&s;h like caged turtles, even refu&s;ing food, till by af|fliction and want they are exhau&s;ted, and finally expire.</P>
<P>The Indians always fight their battles by midnight: indeed their conte&s;ts re&s;emble more a &s;iege than a battle, as the&s;e broils con&s;i&s;t only in &s;urrounding the hamlets of their enemies while they are a&s;leep, making pri&s;oners of the women, boys, and girls, while they &s;hoot the men with poi&s;oned arrows, or with their clubs or apootoos divide their &s;culls when they come to clo&s;e quarters; they al&s;o &s;calp their male pri&s;oners, bring home their hair, and even their bones, as trophies of war, and pre&s;ents to their wives, unle&s;s they intend to &s;ell them to the Europeans at Paramaribo. In their open ren|counters, which happen very &s;eldom, the bows and barbed arrows are their principal weapons of offence; with the&s;e they often kill at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty paces; nay, the &s;wifte&s;t bird in its flight, provided it has the magnitude of a crow, &s;eldom e&s;capes them. In truth, &s;uch is the &s;kill of the&s;e people at the&s;e manly exerci&s;es, that the be&s;t archers at Cre&s;&s;y, Poictiers, and Agincourt, mu&s;t have yielded to their &s;uperiority.</P>
<Q><PB N="402" REF="473">
<L>Now with full force the yielding bow he bends,</L>
<L>Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;</L>
<L>Clo&s;e to his brea&s;t he &s;trains the nerve below,</L>
<L>'Till the barb'd point approach the circling bow.</L>
<L>Th' impatient weapon whizzes on the wing,</L>
<L>Sounds the tough bow, and twangs the quivering &s;tring.</L>
<BIBL>POPE's Homer.</BIBL></Q>
<P>I &s;hall only add farther on this &s;ubject, that when the&s;e Indians go to war they chu&s;e one general commander, whom they di&s;tingui&s;h by the title of <HI>Uill.</HI></P>
<P>The trade or traffic which the Indians of Guiana carry on with the Dutch con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in &s;laves, earthen jars, canoes, hammocks, ba&s;kets, Brazil-wood, hiaree-roots, macaws, parrots, monkeys, bal&s;am capivi, arracocerra, caraba or crab oil, and arnotta, for which they receive in return checquered cloth, fire-arms, gun-powder, hatchets, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, different coloured beads, look|ing-gla&s;&s;es, fi&s;h-hooks, combs, needles, pins, &amp;c. The <HI>bal&s;am capivi</HI> exudes from the bark of a thick tree that grows far inland, with large pointed leaves, bearing a fruit like a cucumber. This gum is yellow, hard, and tran&s;parent, re&s;embling amber; when melted, it has an agreeable &s;mell: its u&s;es are for varni&s;h, and to &s;top diu|retic complaints, &amp;c. The gum called <HI>arracocerra</HI> ex|udes from an inland tree al&s;o; it is yellow as the former, but tenacious and &s;oft; it has a mo&s;t fragrant &s;mell, and is held in great e&s;teem by the Europeans as well as In|dians,
<PB N="403" REF="474">
on account of its efficacy in curing wounds, and many other complaints. The <HI>caraba</HI> or crab oil is made by brui&s;ing, macerating, and boiling the kernels that grow on the crab-tree in brown angular nuts, much about the &s;ize of a large che&s;nut; this oil, which is bitter, be&s;ides anointing the Indians, is u&s;ed for many purpo&s;es by the Europeans. The tree grows to near fifty feet high, with leaves re&s;embling tho&s;e of the laurel; but as I neither have &s;een this nor the two former grow|ing, to my knowledge, I can &s;ay nothing more concern|ing them. The <HI>mawna tree</HI> is high, &s;traight, and light brown coloured; its leaves are oval; its nuts re&s;embling nutmegs, but without either ta&s;te or flavour. The gum exuding from its trunk by inci&s;ions in the bark is di&s;|&s;olved by the Indians in water, and, as I have &s;aid, mixed with arnotta to anoint them. The ca&s;tor or <HI>palma-chri&s;ti</HI> bu&s;h, by botani&s;ts called the <HI>ricinus,</HI> is a &s;hrub about four feet high, jointed, being covered with large digitated leaves on long foot-&s;talks, <HI>viz.</HI> both the &s;tem and the branches. This &s;hrub con&s;i&s;ts of the red and the white, and produces triangular nuts inclo&s;ed in a green hu&s;k, which, when ripe, turns to brown, and falls off. From the&s;e nuts is expre&s;&s;ed the ca&s;tor oil; in Surinam it is called <HI>carrapat oil</HI>; it is very like that made of olives, and, as I have mentioned before, is much u&s;ed by the Indians to paint them&s;elves with.</P>
<P>Among all the Indian nations, the <HI>Caribs</HI> are the mo&s;t numerous, active, and brave. The&s;e re&s;ide in great num|bers
<PB N="404" REF="475">
near the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, which they often ha|ra&s;s, in immortal revenge for the inhuman cruelties in|flicted on their forefathers at Mexico and Peru. They are commanded by a captain, and a&s;&s;emble by the blow|ing of a conch or &s;ea-&s;hell; they have al&s;o frequent battles with neighbouring Indians; but what di&s;graces them above all others in Terra Firma is, that however unnatural it may &s;eem, and however much it has been contradicted, they are anthropophagi or cannibals; at lea&s;t they mo&s;t certainly fea&s;t on their enemies, who&s;e fle&s;h they tear and devour with the avidity of wolves, though this is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be more from a &s;pirit of revenge than from any depravity in their ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The <HI>Accawaw</HI> Indians are few in number, and live far|ther di&s;tant from the &s;ea than the former. Though like the&s;e they live in friend&s;hip with the Dutch, they are both treacherous in admini&s;tering &s;low poi&s;on concealed under their nails, and very di&s;tru&s;tful, as they pali&s;ade the ground round their hamlets with poi&s;oned &s;pikes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Worrow</HI> Indians, if not the mo&s;t cruel, are the mo&s;t de&s;picable of any in Guiana. The&s;e are &s;ettled along the coa&s;t from the river Oronoque to Surinam; they are dark-coloured and extremely ugly; though &s;trong they are pu&s;illanimous, and withal &s;o very lazy and indolent, that their poverty will &s;carcely afford them a covering to hide their nakedne&s;s, which they often &s;upply by the web-like bark of the palm-tree. They often go quite naked, and are &s;tinkingly dirty; from
<PB N="405" REF="476">
their &s;luggi&s;h inactivity they are reduced to live mo&s;tly upon crabs and water. If it &s;hould &s;eem &s;trange to have called the&s;e people happy, let it be recollected that their wi&s;hes are confined to their enjoyments, and that no Indian was ever heard to complain that he was un|happy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Taiiras</HI> are &s;ettled al&s;o on the &s;ea-coa&s;t between Surinam and the river Amazon. The&s;e are exceedingly numerous, being computed, in this &s;ettlement alone, to amount to near twenty thou&s;and: they are a very peace|able but indolent people, and in many particulars re&s;em|ble the <HI>Worrows.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Piannacotaus</HI> live very far inland, and are enemies to the Europeans, with whom they refu&s;e all connection or dealings whatever: of this tribe the only thing that I can &s;ay farther is, that they would murder all the Chri&s;|tians in Guiana, if they had an opportunity.</P>
<P>The only Indian nation within my knowledge now remaining to be mentioned are the <HI>Arrowouks,</HI> my favourites; &mdash; but as this Chapter is already &s;welled to a con&s;iderable length, I mu&s;t defer them to another opportunity.&mdash;Thus for the pre&s;ent do I take my leave of this happy people, who with the di&s;tinctions of rank or land (the cau&s;es of contention in more en|lightened &s;tates) are unacquainted; who know no evil but pain and want, with which they are very &s;el|dom afflicted in this ever-verdant, this ever-blooming climate; who, while their wi&s;hes are &s;o very limited,
<PB N="406" REF="477">
po&s;&s;e&s;s all that they de&s;ire in this world: and who, while they expect a future &s;tate, never give their minds the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, but die in peace; nay, who &s;eldom think upon to-morrow. But while I allow them this &s;pecies of negative happine&s;s, let it not be under&s;tood that to the contented European I have held up their condi|tion as an object of envy.</P>
