<P>Stick to your truth&mdash;but confide in me as u&s;ual.&mdash;You will go with me, then, to Mr. Manly, your father's lawyer, and corroborate all that I &s;hall &s;ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, but what you intend to &s;ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't do that. In the practice of the law, we never know what we intend to &s;ay&mdash;and

<P>And he, &s;ome years &s;ince, implied it to me. Yet, in &s;uch doubtful terms, I knew not which of us had the &s;orrow not to be your child.&mdash;I now find it is my&s;elf&mdash;and I aver it to be a &s;orrow, for which, all the fortune I am going to po&s;&s;e&s;s will not repay me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, indulge the hope you may yet be his daughter. This young

man's merit de&s;erves a reward, and in <HI>time</HI> he may learn to love you by a &s;till nearer tie than that, you have &s;o long known to exi&s;t between you; nay, even by a nearer tie than that of brother.</P>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in doubt or what I hear&mdash;Eleanor, &s;ince our &s;hort &s;eparation, there cannot &s;urely have been any important di&s;covery&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;great di&s;coveries, which we labour in vain for years to make, are frequently brought about in one lucky moment, without any la|bour at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;for till this day aro&s;e, I had pa&s;&s;ed every hour &s;ince my birth, without making one di&s;covery to my advantage&mdash;while this &s;hort, but pro|pitious morning, has di&s;covered to me&mdash;how to be in future happy.</P>

<L>"LONG before the beginng of this Play,"</L>
<L>I heard &s;ome DEEP ones in the Green Room, &s;ay,</L>
<L>They had their fears and doubts&mdash;whil&s;t &s;ome did quake&mdash;</L>
<L>And others wi&s;h'd it bed-time for her &s;ake.</L>
<L>Do you, our be&s;t Phy&s;icians, ever kind,</L>
<L>Pre&s;cribe our true Cephalic for the Mind,</L>
<L>Of the&s;e our Neighbours, and <HI>kind Friends</HI>&mdash;behind,</L>
<L>And with it, give a cordial of the be&s;t,</L>
<L>To one, with deepe&s;t Gratitude impre&s;t.</L>
<L>For &s;ome there are&mdash;I have them in my eye&mdash;</L>
<L>Will &s;icken and turn pale with jealou&s;y,</L>
<L>Whene'er we &s;cribbling Women wield the Pen,</L>
<L>Or dare invade the Rights of &s;cribbling Men;</L>
<L>And fir'd with zeal, in dread array appear&mdash;</L>
<L>With Tenets from the <HI>learned</HI> Hemi&s;phere;</L>
<L>Thence cry <HI>(kind Souls)</HI> "Invention is the only Art,</L>
<L>"And mere Tran&s;lation but a &s;econd Part;</L>

<L>But might I whi&s;per in this Cen&s;or's ear,</L>
<L>I'd prove his ob&s;ervations too &s;evere&mdash;</L>
<L><PB REF="68">And urge&mdash;"Tran&s;lation to hit off with &s;kill,</L>

<L>And as for you, ye Fair, how blooms the Cheek,</L>
<L>How &s;weet the Temper which tho&s;e eyes be&s;peak?</L>
<L>No Midnight Oil has e'er de&s;troy'd a Grace,</L>
<L>Or Gaming's Horrors found with you a place;</L>

<L>Check then with me the&s;e Cen&s;ors as unju&s;t,</L>
