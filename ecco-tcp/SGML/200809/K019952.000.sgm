<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a ju&s;t image given us by Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> of the &s;ituation of an author, where he mentions a POET ambitious of prai&s;e, and a CRITIC picking his pocket. It is, indeed, almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible for any man to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the literary world, without having a gang of the&s;e people &s;warming about him; though he has at the &s;ame time this con&s;olation, that all &s;uch <HI>petty larceny</HI> attempts are a mark of his fame; and the unpro|voked abu&s;e of ill-de&s;igning per&s;ons is, in its own nature, invo|luntary prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The author of the following trifle has had his &s;hare of this kind of trouble ever &s;ince his name has been heard of: he has boa&s;ted, upon a former occa&s;ion, of the honour a certain reverend writer did him by his calumny; but, as if that was not &s;uffi|cient, his name is now adorned with a PARSON CHURCHILL. This la&s;t per&s;on's hand he has felt in his pocket twice in a very &s;hort time: in the <HI>Ro&s;ciad</HI> it was but a dip, and away; but as if
<PB N="ii" REF="3">this a&s;toni&s;hing genius, who has lately amazed mankind, had improved in his trade, in his <HI>Apology</HI> he has attempted to make an intire rummage. Whether he has taken any thing out of the pre&s;ent writer's pocket, is a point not very certain; &s;o that the lo&s;s, however, cannot be very great.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, Can the Reverend Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> Curate of <HI>St. John's, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> be con&s;idered as Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI>'s lite|rary pickpocket, when he boldly owns his name, and &s;hews him&s;elf to the public?&mdash;In an&s;wer to this, it &s;hould be con&s;i|dered, that the&s;e people have various ways of doing their bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Some of them &s;neak in alleys, and little lurking holes, and, as a gentleman pa&s;&s;es by, they make a &s;natch at his pocket; and &s;hould they prove &s;o unfortunate as to give an alarm, and meet with a &s;hort turn, "<HI>Pray remember the poor&mdash;for the love of</HI>&mdash;" Others of them go more daringly to work&mdash;<Q>Bob, <HI>do you &s;ee that gentleman yonder?&mdash;&s;hall I</HI> DO <HI>him?</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Ay! ay!</HI> cries Bob, <HI>do him by all means.</HI></Q>&mdash; <Q><HI>So I will&mdash;Link your honour&mdash;light your honour acro&s;s the &s;treet&mdash;my name is</HI> CHARLEY DUNGHILL&mdash;<HI>I ply here every night, your honour</HI>&mdash;</Q> Then on he runs, twirling his link almo&s;t in your face;&mdash;gives you an unlucky &s;pla&s;h, and, in your &s;udden confu&s;ion, makes a &s;nap at your handkerchief: his friends admire his dexterity; he is proclaimed abroad for a notable clever fellow; you are told he is a brui&s;er into the bargain, and handles an OAK-STICK won|derfully!
<PB N="iii" REF="4">This will be acknowledged to be the ca&s;e among the pilferers in our common &s;treets; and among their brethren of the quill the conduct is &s;o &s;imilar, that the writer of the &s;ub&s;equent Ode cannot con&s;ider the REVEREND CHARLES CHURCHILL in any other light than that of a CRITIC PICKING HIS POCKET; and as he is well informed that Mr. <HI>John Fielding</HI> has attained many points, highly &s;erviceable to &s;ociety, by <HI>quick notice and &s;udden pur&s;uit</HI> among the nimble-fingered race, who infe&s;t this metropolis, he is in hopes that the &s;ame means will operate equally in the literary world. For this purpo&s;e, he now thinks proper to celebrate the egregious endowments of this New Adventurer; de&s;iring it may be remembered, that this is the fir&s;t notice he has given of him: for, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;inuations of Mr. <HI>Churchill</HI> and his friends, be it hereby known, that Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI> never wrote, or cau&s;ed to be written, directly or indirectly, a &s;ingle line in the <HI>Critical Review.</HI> In ju&s;tice, however, to the public, and him|&s;elf, he thinks it now incumbent on him to give the be&s;t de|&s;cription he can of the man who has, at two different times, made an attempt upon him. Should this furious <HI>Drawcan&s;ir,</HI> after this, think proper to proceed in his de&s;ign, Mr. <HI>Murphy,</HI> in con&s;ideration of his being <HI>unbeneficed,</HI> and reflecting how hard the pre&s;ent dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions, and the <HI>late Tax</HI> upon PORTER, mu&s;t bear upon the Reverend Bard, mo&s;t heartily gives his con&s;ent to be abu&s;ed by him <HI>"Body, Soul, and Mu&s;e,"</HI> as often as thir&s;t or
<PB N="iv" REF="5">hunger &s;hall prompt his genius: and &s;hould he be told hereafter, that the author of unpoetic libels is not hurt in his preferment, but that "to one bi&s;hop, <HI>Churchill</HI> &s;eems a wit," he promi&s;es him to repine le&s;s at his &s;ucce&s;s, though provoked, than Mr. <HI>Churchill</HI> and his little faction &s;eem, unprovoked, to have done at Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI>'s.</P>
