<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>AS all nece&s;&s;ary Information, con|cerning the Scene, the Per&s;ons, and the Scope, of this literary Dialogue, may be found in the following Introductory Letter &mdash; I have only to detain the Reader, while I tell him, that it was written by a young Cambridge Scho|lar, on a Vi&s;it at the Hou&s;e of a Noble Relation, to one of his Intimates at College.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTORY LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCEPT, with your u&s;ual par|tiality and animating good-nature, the fir&s;t-fruits of a petty but u&s;eful talent, which your kind &s;ug|ge&s;tion fir&s;t tempted me to acquire.</P>
<P>You may remember, that in tho&s;e attic evenings of our college, when we happily e&s;caped from le&s;s alluring
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
&s;ociety, to devote our&s;elves together to Demo&s;thenes or Cicero, you have often &s;aid, that an early facility in writing &s;hort-hand, would be a de&s;i|rable acqui&s;ition for a young &s;tudent, who confe&s;&s;es a very ambitious, but, I fear, a very vain de&s;ire, to emulate, in due time, tho&s;e demi-gods of eloquence. Let me now inform you, that when you &s;ee me again, you will &s;ee a tolerable proficient in the art you commended. Whe|ther my proficiency has been mo&s;t quickened by my friend&s;hip for you,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
or by my native ambition, I &s;hall leave my dear Philo&s;opher to decide, in one of tho&s;e contemplative mi|nutes, when a recent peru&s;al of his favourite Plato has augmented his characteri&s;tic propen&s;ity to &s;cruti|ni&s;e human nature.</P>
<P>By the way, as the greate&s;t of philo&s;ophers are a little apt to for|get their own private tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, let me whi&s;per to you, that you are an ab&s;olute traitor for reading Plato alone, e&s;pecially as we had
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
agreed to read in concert the par|ticular dialogues that our beloved Gray has honoured with his ap|plau&s;e. Treachery, however, al|ways includes its own puni&s;hment; and I have the ill-natured &s;ati&s;|faction of being convinced, that you have but half enjoyed what you have read in my ab&s;ence. Per|haps, reading of every kind be|comes more delightful and more improving, when we &s;hare the amu&s;ement with a congenial mind. As to dialogues, we have, you
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
know, determined the point, when, in reading tho&s;e of Cicero together, we found, that his animated and graceful compo&s;ition received new &s;pirit from the plea&s;ing interchange of two friendly voices. Perhaps you are not yet aware, that you are at this moment reading a &s;ort of preface to &s;ome new dialogues: &s;uch is the pre&s;ent that I have de&s;ired you to accept. I &s;ee your &s;urprize, and the per&s;ua&s;ion that follows it: &mdash; but in truth, my friend, you are mi&s;taken. Had
<PB N="x" REF="9">
they been compo&s;itions of mine, I &s;hould not, by reminding you of Plato and of Tully, have imi|tated the &s;imple dwarf, &s;o happily alluded to by the lively Sterne;&mdash; in pre&s;enting my littlene&s;s to your view, I &s;hould not have pre&s;ented to you the &s;tandard by which you might mea&s;ure it. Nor do I &s;end you the production of any writer, who, being le&s;s dwarfi&s;h than my|&s;elf, and boldly endeavouring to emulate tho&s;e literary giants, has attained, in &s;ome degree, that mar|vellous
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
union of grace and vigour, to which they are indebted for their im|mortal reputation. &mdash; What then do I &s;end you? &mdash; In truth, a rarity; and one, I tru&s;t, entirely to your ta&s;te. &mdash; I &s;end you a faithful copy of real and &s;pirited dialogues, that pa&s;&s;ed under the roof, though not in the pre&s;ence, of a certain noble Lord, who&s;e name is fa|miliar to you, and where conver&s;a|tion, you know, is frequently &s;aid to a&s;&s;ume a truly attic vivacity.&mdash;I do not tell you that the inclo&s;ed is per|fectly
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
in the &s;tyle of your idol Pla|to:&mdash;it contains, indeed, no &s;ublime enthu&s;ia&s;m, nor logical &s;ubtlety on metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects; but you will find in it, what mo&s;t modern readers would think, perhaps, more alluring, an ample and free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all the merits and defects in two emi|nent and admirable, but very differ|ent writers, who, having lately clo&s;ed their career, have left the &s;urviv|ing public at full liberty to &s;cru|tinize, to e&s;timate, and enforce their re&s;pective claims to immortality.&mdash;
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
As the&s;e writers have been con&s;idered as rivals, you will find that the cau&s;e of each is pleaded with the affec|tionate zeal of an enlightened ad|mirer.&mdash;As it generally happens in pleadings of every kind, each advo|cate is tempted, in prai&s;ing his client, to indulge him&s;elf in &s;ome &s;evere animadver&s;ions upon the oppo&s;ite party.&mdash;Yet, for the credit of both &s;ides, I am per&s;uaded you will agree with me, that the whole debate is conducted with a liberal di&s;dain of vulgar prejudice, and that all the
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
&s;peakers advance no more than what the particular turn of their own mind had induced them to con&s;ider as the dictates of truth and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>By the rambling &s;tyle of their dialogue, you will perceive, that it was real conver&s;ation, and no formal compo&s;ition of &s;eque&s;tered &s;tudy.&mdash; As you are &s;o fond of clo&s;e rea&s;oning, I mention this circum&s;tance, to ob|viate your objection to pa&s;&s;ages that, I am confident, you would other|wi&s;e con&s;ider as defects.&mdash;As to my|&s;elf,
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
being a le&s;s rigid votary to rea&s;on than my dear Philo&s;opher, I am ever willing to &s;acrifice a few grains of logic, for an equal portion of &s;pirit and freedom.</P>
<P>But it is high time for me to re|collect, that, in&s;tead of hinting to you the value of my pre&s;ent (which might, indeed, be prudent, or at lea&s;t very fa&s;hionable, if I were making a pre&s;ent to the public) I ought to tell you, as briefly as I can, the particular incidents that enabled
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
me to &s;end you this &s;ingular proof of my regard.</P>
<P>It happened, that in two days after my arrival here, my Lord was obliged to leave us, and depart alone, on &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s, for Ire|land.&mdash;My kind and accompli&s;hed relation a&s;&s;umed the privilege, that &s;he is u&s;ed to take in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, and became (to u&s;e the title I give her, in my idle rail|lery) Lord Lieutenant of the Libra|ry &mdash; no trifling dominion, I can
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
a&s;&s;ure you, but of con&s;iderable extent, and admirably peopled with &s;ubjects of every cla&s;s.&mdash;You will recollect the de&s;cription I have given you, of the noble room my Lord has allotted to his books; and particu|larly the elegant and commodious little rece&s;&s;es in the apartment, that are excellently contrived to admit a multiplicity of volumes. Our little party con&s;i&s;ted, for &s;ome time, of Lady Caroline <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fictitious chri&s;tian name, &s;ub&s;tituted here, and in the Dialogues, for the real title of the &s;peaker.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Note by the Editor.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, an amiable and old fe|male
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
friend of hers, with her bro|ther the Colonel, and your humble &s;ervant: for the young people of the hou&s;e are &s;till abroad on their tra|vels.&mdash;After breakfa&s;ting in a chear|ful parlour, that commands a view of the grove, and the lake illumi|nated by the Sun as he ri&s;es, we have con&s;tantly moved together into the library. Here, as my pa&s;&s;ion for books is known, and indulged, I have &s;ometimes loitered, in one of the rece&s;&s;es, and, peeping into various whim&s;ical authors, have utterly for|got
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
to join in the conver&s;ation; and &s;ometimes, after giving the company a due caution not to talk trea&s;on, I have endeavoured, while I was &s;creen|ed from their &s;ight, to advance in my new crooked labour of writing &s;hort hand, by catching the di&s;cour&s;e of the moment. One morning, when I had thus employed my&s;elf, I &s;hew|ed my manu&s;cript to Lady Caroline, not indeed from the motive that influenced a certain philo&s;ophical &s;hort-hand writer, who, having a very talkative wife, took down, with|out
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
the good woman's &s;u&s;pecting his employment, all the &s;aid in a week, and pre&s;ented to her a legible tran&s;|cript of the whole; when, as my &s;tory goes, the hone&s;t dame was &s;o &s;hocked by the horrid figure which her peevi&s;h loquacity made on paper, that &s;he rewarded the Philo&s;opher, for his elaborate, tender, and &s;ilent reproof, by correcting her foible.&mdash;I was equally fortunate, though on a very different occa&s;ion. My fair cou|&s;in, who&s;e conver&s;ation, I mu&s;t &s;ay, has as little to fear from &s;uch an artifice,
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
as any per&s;on's can have, was amu&s;ed with my work, and, as we happen|ed to be alone when I produced it, &s;he thus imparted to me the project it &s;ugge&s;ted:&mdash;"You know, my dear Edmund, we expect our good neigh|bour the Archdeacon to pa&s;s a few days here; you know what an ido|later he is of Doctor John&s;on; and you know the Colonel's equal devotion to Lord Che&s;terfield:&mdash;we will contrive to engage the&s;e two literary enthu&s;ia&s;ts in an amicable debate on their re&s;pective idols. You
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
&s;hall invi&s;ibly catch their dialogue, as you have done this; and, to &s;hew that we have acted with no in&s;idious de&s;ign, we will afterwards allow them the liberty of peru&s;ing, and, if either de&s;ires it, of burning the paper. &mdash;So &s;aid, &s;o done.&mdash;I have only to detain you from the dialogue, while I tell you, that, as they are both men of a &s;ocial and benevolent di&s;|po&s;ition, they were &s;o far from be|ing offended by this theft of their words, that each has had the good-nature to comply with my reque&s;t,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
and not only revi&s;e, but correct and improve his portion of the debate. So that you receive their &s;peeches, like the authentic printed orations of our eloquent &s;enators, corrected in the clo&s;et, and &s;till faithfully breath|ing all the warm &s;pirit with which they were &s;poken.&mdash;I &s;hould add, that Lady Caroline &s;et a &s;ort of little trap for the di&s;putants, which caught them to our with:&mdash;&s;he had placed on her own little table in the library, a quarto volume of Lord Che&s;terfield, with two of John&s;on's

<P>It repre&s;ented to my imagination the deci&s;ive triumph of the once indigent and neglected, but truly great Morali&s;t, over the high-born and fa&s;hionable Wit, who&s;e vain talents were, during his life, the idol of his country.</P>

<P>I would not offend the Colonel for the world: but I am &s;ure, he has too &s;ound a judgment, both in literature and morals, to con&s;ider the&s;e writers on a level.&mdash;He may perhaps be partial to the memory of Lord Che&s;terfield, from a per&s;onal acquaintance with that noble|man; and if &s;o, I &s;incerely a&s;k his par|don for having alluded to the public failings of his friend.</P>

<P>Your courte&s;y, my dear Sir, is &s;o en|gaging, and I have in truth &s;uch e&s;teem for your judgment, that I could wi&s;h to think with you on all points. I am

convinced, indeed, that we agree per|fectly in all e&s;&s;ential articles, though our coats are &s;o different in their colour&mdash; and you, who have the happy art of uniting zeal and moderation in matters of highe&s;t moment, will, I am &s;ure, be candid enough not to think me either a fool or a libertine for admiring my Lord Che&s;terfield.

But it is not on any familiarity that I can boa&s;t of with this accom|pli&s;hed per&s;onage; it is on a deliberate &s;urvey of his life and character, and a long intimacy with his truly attic com|po&s;itions, that I have founded my in|crea&s;ing

<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="29">
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Con&s;ider, my dear Colonel, that the cen&s;ure on your favourite, which you repre&s;ent as unju&s;t, has not proceeded only from a few individuals, who might be eager to in&s;ult the memory of the eminent from the pride of ignorance, or the malice of envy. It may be re|garded as the outcry of an offended nation. A whole people can hardly be inclined to pronounce &s;entence on any writer with malignity and ingrati|tude, e&s;pecially on the dead. But there are certain unexpected offences in the moral world, which bur&s;t upon us with an a&s;pect of &s;uch enormity, as &s;eems to force from the lips of every unpre|judiced &s;pectator, the mo&s;t rapid and
<PB N="7" REF="30">
ab&s;olute condemnation. There are &s;ome violations, I will not &s;ay of religion and of virtue, but of common &s;en&s;e and common decency, which an hone&s;t attention to the good of mankind for|bids us to tolerate or forgive. I am afraid the &s;ins of your favourite mu&s;t be ranked in this unfortunate cla&s;s. For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I e&s;teem it &s;o dangerous a thing to pour the oil of licentious admonition on the blazing fire of youth, that I wi&s;h his Letters had been de&s;troyed. And &s;urely you, Colonel, who never exert the pri|vilege often allowed to your profe&s;&s;ion, of treating &s;erious things with levity, you, I think, can never wi&s;h to recon|cile our minds to the horrid image of a father preaching adultery to his &s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="31">
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heavens! my dear Sir, is it po&s;&s;ible that a man of your candor and di&s;cernment can join in the barbarous inference that has been drawn from the letter you allude to? If we are to be condemned &s;o cruelly, on a few idle or wanton words, that e&s;cape in &s;ome luck|le&s;s or unguarded moment, where is the mortal of &s;ufficient purity to &s;up|port this rigorous inqui&s;ition? not your great Morali&s;t, believe me. If Che&s;ter|field mu&s;t fall by &s;uch a &s;crutiny, &s;o in|deed mu&s;t John&s;on. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have heard the common anecdotes of this ju&s;tly-celebrated writer, have heard his reply to a per&s;on, who once a&s;ked him, what he reckoned the highe&s;t plea|&s;ures of human life? It is well known
<PB N="9" REF="32">
that he named the two gro&s;&s;e&s;t of our &s;en&s;ual enjoyments, and without cool|ing the hot idea by one of his &s;ix-footed circumlocutions. Shall I therefore call your great morali&s;t a preacher of glut|tony and incontinence? Truth and ju&s;|tice forbid! yet &s;urely I might do &s;o as fairly as you arraign my favourite, in con&s;equence of a few &s;portive words in a private letter.&mdash;But let us not play the inqui&s;itor with an au&s;terity that con|verts into a crime every ca&s;ual expre&s;|&s;ion, and is pregnant it&s;elf with more evil than it profe&s;&s;es to correct. Let us judge of books, and of men, not from a few &s;cattered failings in &s;entiment, &s;tyle, or conduct, but from the full and fair impre&s;&s;ion which a complete and deli|berate &s;urvey of their blended merits and defects may leave upon our mind.
<PB N="10" REF="33">
If on this plain and ample ground, you are willing to enter into a friendly de|bate on the different portions of cen|&s;ure and of honour, that may be due both to Che&s;terfield and to John&s;on, I &s;hall by no means decline the conte&s;t, for, though I am mo&s;t willing to allow that the latter will have much the more able advocate, I &s;hall not de&s;pair of prov|ing that my favourite (as you ju&s;tly call him) was in truth, "take him for all in all," as good a man, as &s;ound a morali&s;t, and as eloquent a writer, as the renowned philo&s;opher whom you particularly ad|mire.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LADY CAROLINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard a more tempting chal|lenge, and I tru&s;t the Archdeacon has too much &s;pirit to refu&s;e it. As you are
<PB N="11" REF="34">
two men whom we may &s;afely lead in|to a warm debate without the &s;lighte&s;t fear of its con&s;equence, I confe&s;s my|&s;elf very de&s;irous of &s;eeing you engage. Though oppo&s;ite in your opinion, and zealous in your nature, I am perfectly &s;ure that your controver&s;y can produce no painful or unfriendly &s;en&s;ations in the mind of either; and to me it will afford both plea&s;ure and in&s;truction&mdash;it will enable me to &s;ettle my own con|fu&s;ed thoughts concerning two authors whom I am fond of reading, and who, to tell you the truth, both delight and di&s;gu&s;t me to &s;uch a degree, that I &s;hall be particularly glad to hear the good and evil in both deliberately examined and candidly compared.</P>

<P>They are Beings, my dear lady, that will not admit of a compari&s;on.&mdash;Would you not be angry with me, if I com|pared my hone&s;t friend Lion, the noble ma&s;tiff who guards your magnificent man&s;ion, with the &s;ly and mi&s;chievous Fox that has lately invaded your poul|try. Such a compari&s;on only can be made between the generous In&s;tructor who&s;e le&s;&s;ons defend our virtue, and the pernicious Wit who&s;e writings only tend to circumvent and de&s;troy it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire the &s;pirit and ingenuity of your &s;imile; but, like a ball thrown with too much force, it rebounds &s;o unluckily as to hurt your&s;elf: for I mu&s;t inform
<PB N="13" REF="36">
you, that your hone&s;t friend Lion was almo&s;t condemned, a few days ago, to a violent death &mdash; and he might indeed have &s;uffered with ju&s;tice, not only for arrogating to him&s;elf much more than his due, but for mangling mo&s;t fero|ciou&s;ly an excellent little &s;paniel, who dared to lap out of their common di&s;h, and whom he ought to have regarded as a fellow-&s;ervant, of equal value with him&s;elf in the &s;ight of his bountiful and indulgent ma&s;ter.&mdash;After telling you this anecdote, I will not be &s;o cruel as to add, that I think you have pitched on a perfect emblem of your great philo&s;o|pher. Yet allow me to &s;ay, that he cer|tainly did not re&s;emble your old phi|lo&s;ophical acquaintance, the Demonax of Lucian (who&s;e name has been im|properly applied to him) in the want

either of faculty or di&s;po&s;ition

<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow your raillery its full &s;cope. I am ready to confe&s;s, there was a &s;urly grandeur in the character of John&s;on. He was u&s;ed to &s;purn the effu&s;ions of vice and folly with a fervent and vir|tuous indignation, that was frequently mi&s;taken for brutal ferocity. An in|ce&s;&s;ant zeal for moral excellence was his ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and he had an un|exampled
<PB N="15" REF="38">
power of extracting morality from every incident of life, from every appearance in nature. No man ever ex|erted more inten&s;e or more con&s;tant thought, to &s;earch into the e&s;&s;ence of all goodne&s;s, on his own account, and to render his re&s;earches beneficial to man|kind: it is on this ground that he is generally regarded as a teacher of true wi&s;dom, inferior only to the &s;acred wri|ters them&s;elves; and it is for the in|tere&s;t of human nature, that we &s;hould guard the glory of &s;uch a man from the petty cavils of detraction, or the un|intended injury of mi&s;conception.&mdash; For my own part, I &s;hould &s;ay, indeed, that I am more intimate with him as a morali&s;t than as a critic.

Colonel, who, for a modern &s;oldier, are &s;ingularly di&s;po&s;ed to moral contempla|tion; you, the attentive father of well-educated children; you, I &s;ay, can hard|ly think of &s;eriou&s;ly comparing an au|thor of this character to one who&s;e com|po&s;itions (if I may venture to u&s;e the vehement cen&s;ure of my indignant cri|tic) exhibit only

<P>I thank you, my dear di&s;putant, for blending politene&s;s with your zeal. I perceive that your tender re&s;pect to fe|male ears, has led you to &s;often one expre&s;&s;ion in the very bitter though con|ci&s;e invective you have quoted.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="40">
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are perfectly acquainted, you &s;ee, with the &s;arca&s;tic gall of your great Morali&s;t. But let me ob&s;erve, that the keene&s;t &s;arca&s;ms, in general, rather prove the virulence, or at lea&s;t the pride, of the accu&s;er, than the vices of the accu&s;ed. Indeed, your idol him&s;elf, to do him ju&s;tice, in&s;tructs us how to value them, when he &s;ays, in this very volume,
<Q>Ob|&s;ervation daily &s;hews, that much &s;tre&s;s is not to be laid on hyperbolical ac|cu&s;ations and pointed &s;entences, which even he that utters them de&s;ires to be applauded rather than credited.</Q>
But let me read to you the clo&s;e of this paragraph, it is admirable:&mdash;
<Q>Few characters can bear the micro|&s;copic &s;crutiny of wit quickened by
<PB N="18" REF="41">
anger; and perhaps the be&s;t advice to authors would be, that they &s;hould keep out of the way of one another.</Q>
Here you find that your great Morali&s;t, thought it hardly po&s;&s;ible for an author to regard his brethren but with an evil eye; and ju&s;tly, perhaps, we might ex|claim, on this occa&s;ion,
<Q><L>His own example &s;trengthens all his laws,</L>
<L>He is him&s;elf the micro&s;cope he draws.</L></Q>
Rarely indeed did he fail to magnify the defects of &s;uch as were placed before him; though his own great qualities were blended with &s;uch imperfections, that, if the latter were &s;hewn to us through a gla&s;s, who&s;e magnifying power was equal to his own, he would cer|tainly appear as the mo&s;t enormous
<PB N="19" REF="42">
mon&s;ter that ever ro&s;e into philo&s;ophical reputation with bitterne&s;s of language and brutality of manners. Indeed you may recollect, that in his life-time, his own virulence was often retorted upon him. He has been called, you know, "a re&s;pectable Hottentot," and the Caliban of literature. But alas! what is proved by &s;arca&s;ms of this kind, on either &s;ide? Little more, I believe, than the lamentable prevalence of jealous and angry pa&s;&s;ions in the heated candi|dates for popular applau&s;e. For my own part, as I have, though I am no writer, a pa&s;&s;ionate regard for the real intere&s;t and glory of literature, I am grieved whenever I &s;ee authors of great genius conde&s;cend to hack and mangle one another, like &s;ervile gladiators, to gratify the rabble, in&s;tead of combating
<PB N="20" REF="43">
in a common cau&s;e, like free and gene|rous citizens, again&s;t ignorance and envy, the peculiar enemies of their republic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, my good friend, we perfectly agree&mdash;believe me, I lament, as &s;incerely as you do, the jealous infirmity of ex|alted &s;pirits, &s;o very common among the profe&s;&s;ors of every art, that many people con&s;ider it as nece&s;&s;arily inherent in that fine texture of the human faculties which we denominate genius.&mdash;I am far from wi&s;hing to repre&s;ent John&s;on as utterly exempt from a natural defect, which he had the rare magnanimity to own and the virtue to &s;uppre&s;s; for what can redound more to the honour of any man, and e&s;pecially of a profe&s;&s;ed phi|lo&s;opher, than to have it ju&s;tly &s;aid of
<PB N="21" REF="44">
him, that he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly regulated every improper movement of his heart by a powerful and maje&s;tic under&s;tanding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rigid truth and ju&s;tice, I believe, could never &s;ay &s;o of John&s;on; but, allowing you for a moment that they might, I can ea&s;ily tell you what would be more honourable, or, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, what would render a philo&s;opher a much more amiable being in my e&s;timation; and it is &s;imply this&mdash;to po&s;&s;e&s;s a heart &s;o kindly fa&s;hioned by nature, that its own native benevolence &s;hould &s;upply the place of your maje&s;tic regulator.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, you prefer a ready-made philo&s;opher to one who has had the merit
<PB N="22" REF="45">
of making him&s;elf. In the quiet vale of private life, where no &s;ort of competi|tion awakens the turbulent affections of the mind, your undi&s;ciplined philo&s;o|pher may be all-&s;ufficient. But in a continual conte&s;t for popular applau&s;e, where the faculties are ever on the &s;tretch, and where the pa&s;&s;ions frequent|ly blaze in proportion to the activity of the intellectual powers; in &s;uch a &s;cene, and &s;uch you know is the field of li|terature, we mu&s;t not, I fear, expect the gentle voice of benevolence to be at|tended to as it ought. Authors, we know, are irritable to a proverb; and how ra|pidly they are hurried into wilful or blind inju&s;tice to each other, we &s;ee but too clearly from every period in the hi&s;tory of letters. But if &s;uch are the infirmities to which their condition ex|po&s;es
<PB N="23" REF="46">
them, ought we not to conceive a &s;ignal re&s;pect for that eminent writer, who con&s;tantly exerted his philo&s;ophy, and forgive me if I add his religion, to pre&s;erve him from the&s;e exce&s;&s;es? It is in this point of view, that the character of John&s;on appears to me particularly noble. Where can we find an author, who, in running &s;o long a career in the &s;ame thorny field, has done &s;o much for the honour of his profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;o little for the gratification of his private &s;pleen? In&s;ulted and reviled as he was perpetually, when did he write a vindi|cation of him&s;elf, or a &s;atire upon his enemies? It does him, I think, infinite credit, to reflect, that with powers par|ticularly formed to make him the fir&s;t &s;atiri&s;t that ever exi&s;ted, he cho&s;e to exert all the energy of his &s;pirit in moral
<PB N="24" REF="47">
compo&s;itions of a very different nature; in &s;uch as might invigorate the under|&s;tanding, without affording any food to the malignity of mankind. At the time when we may &s;uppo&s;e his re&s;entment to have been mo&s;t awakened, when his cha|racter was acrimoniou&s;ly delineated un|der the title of Pompo&s;o, by a &s;atiri&s;t of great celebrity, you may remember that he di&s;dained to take any kind of re|venge, and I do not indeed recollect, that he has mentioned the name of Churchill in any of his writings. His great mind was aware, that in &s;ome kinds of contention the very act of en|gaging is di&s;grace. He perfectly under|&s;tood an important truth, which few in|deed of his fraternity have had &s;pirit enough to confide in, or temper &s;ufficient to attend to, I mean, a maxim which he
<PB N="25" REF="48">
expre&s;&s;es mo&s;t happily him&s;elf in clo&s;ing one of his admirable Ramblers, and, if my memory deceives me not, it runs thus:
<Q>Whatever be the motive to in|&s;ult, it is always be&s;t to overlook it; for folly &s;carcely can de&s;erve re&s;ent|ment, and malice is puni&s;hed by neg|lect.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>An excellent maxim, I grant you, in many ca&s;es; and it reflects as much ho|nour on the preacher, as a good &s;ermon on humility would reflect on a certain prelate of our acquaintance, who&s;e ge|neral demeanor might lead us to &s;uppo&s;e, that he knew not even the name of that virtue. The forbearance of John|&s;on, according to your own account of it, was the offspring, not of charity but
<PB N="26" REF="49">
of pride. He did not throw, indeed, upon paper, any deliberate invective again&s;t his opponents; but we learn, from the diligent retailers of his con|ver&s;ation, that his common di&s;cour&s;e was a continued &s;tream of &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t all who did not blindly acquie&s;ce in his dogmatical deci&s;ions; &s;o that the commendation due to his pacific con|duct, if rigidly examined, amounts only to this&mdash;he never drew out his heavy artillery again&s;t his enemies, becau&s;e he thought that he could demoli&s;h them with le&s;s trouble, and more &s;ecurity to him&s;elf, by the &s;nap of a pocket pi&s;tol.</P>

<P>Come, come, my dear champions, this is but an idle, and, I think, an

unfair &s;ort of &s;kirmi&s;h. I mu&s;t be the arbiter of your conte&s;ts, not only as to the i&s;&s;ue, but the mode of con|ducting it.

I pro&s;cribe, therefore, all bitter &s;arca&s;ms, as poi&s;oned weapons, that ought to be bani&s;hed from our li&s;ts. To drop my metaphor, which, I confe&s;s, I cannot very well &s;upport, let me remind you, that I expect a full and candid compa|ri&s;on of the two illu&s;trious authors whom you re&s;pectively admire.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we might literally interpret one of the many poets whom your Morali&s;t has vilified, and exclaim with Gray,
<Q>E'en in our a&s;hes live their wonted fires,</Q>
then, indeed, I &s;hould apprehend that the du&s;t of John&s;on might be di&s;turbed, by our comparing him to a writer whom he &s;eems to have hated with theological bitterne&s;s, and who&s;e reputation he at|tempted to &s;tab with the &s;hort, but en|venomed
<PB N="29" REF="52">
dagger of a vindictive monk. But though I am far from thinking your favourite &s;o virtuous and pure a cha|racter as you &s;eem to do, I can readily believe that his &s;oul is now happily purified from that leaven of &s;our infir|mity, which deba&s;ed, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in my e&s;timation, his &s;ingular and ex|alted powers. I can believe, that if his a&s;hes were indeed in&s;ulted by any indecent outrage (which Heaven forbid) his &s;pirit now, like that of Pompey, de&s;cribed by Lucan,
<Q><L>Would &s;mile at the vain malice of his foe,</L>
<L>And pity impotent mankind below.</L></Q>
Believe me, I am &s;o far from being an enemy to his memory, that I think his writings and his life are both worthy
<PB N="30" REF="53">
of being &s;tudied. In both, we may find much to admire and emulate, with much to cen&s;ure and avoid. With both, I would only wi&s;h to take &s;uch liberty as he &s;eems to allow, where he tells us, that,

<P>Very well, my dear, decent brother!

<P>Before I &s;peak a word in reply to the Colonel, allow me to a&s;k your Lady&s;hip one whim&s;ical que&s;tion:&mdash;You know that we all love and revere you as a matronly model of female virtues. Con&s;cious of &s;uch a character, &s;hould you not blu&s;h with indignation at the thought of being compared to the cele|brated Ninon, or to any more accom|pli&s;hed courtezan, if any &s;uch can be found in the annals of gallantry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY CAROLINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your que&s;tion is, indeed, rather whim|&s;ical; and, if I wi&s;hed to evade it, per|haps I might ju&s;tly &s;ay, in the lan|guage of our lawyers, it is not a ca&s;e in point.&mdash;But, as I am eager to promote
<PB N="32" REF="55">
the friendly debate to which my brother has invited you, I will be very frank in my an&s;wer, and tell you my genuine feelings on your fanciful &s;uppo&s;ition. If the odd compari&s;on you &s;ugge&s;t was candidly made, and chiefly to &s;hew what a different a&s;&s;emblage of virtues and failings may be found in different &s;ituations (for all mortals, you know, have &s;ome failings, and I am far from thinking tho&s;e of Ninon the only ble|mi&s;hes that may be found in our &s;ex); if, I &s;ay, your odd compari&s;on was con|ducted with that extreme delicacy which it certainly requires, I believe &mdash;</P>

<P>Believe, indeed, my dear prude!&mdash; Come; if you are not confident enough to &s;peak the true language of your

Some fami|liar words of John&s;on, that I have ju&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="62">

<P>Your Lady&s;hip is undoubtedly very good, to a&s;&s;ign me only that &s;ort of ta&s;k
<PB N="41" REF="64">
in which my duty and inclination may go hand in hand; for, according to your in&s;tructions, I have only to &s;hew the genuine dignity of the genius and virtue I admire, and to point out the real de|formity of that di&s;&s;olute elegance, which has made, I think, too favourable an impre&s;&s;ion on the fancy of my friend. Yet, honourable and plea&s;ing as I mu&s;t own the office you have allotted me, I mu&s;t al&s;o confe&s;s, what happens, I be|lieve, very frequently to men &s;urprized by unexpected honours, that I feel my mind dazzled and bewildered by the &s;plendor of my charge, and that I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by no little fear of di&s;appoint|ing your expectation.&mdash;But let me re|flect how I may be&s;t &s;hew my obedience to the &s;pirit, though not the letter of your command.

particulars that do honour to John&s;on, is what I am ill-prepared to do, and what, indeed, could hardly be done in conver|&s;ation; for it would be to give an ex|ten&s;ive review of a long, laborious life, continually ennobled by new acqui&s;itions of knowledge, or by new acts of good|ne&s;s and magnanimity.

<PB N="43" REF="66">
hardly be admitted as a preceptor into a noble family, from the horrid convul|&s;ive di&s;tortions with which he was af|flicted.&mdash;Good Heaven! when I con|&s;ider from what humble and di&s;advan|tageous ob&s;curity he &s;tarted, and what pure eminence he attained, although penury, deformity, and di&s;ea&s;e were con|&s;piring to impede his advancement, I not only perceive the marvellous merits of the man, but feel a &s;ublime delight in contemplating the native powers of genius, and the genuine dignity of &s;cience, &s;upported only by virtue.</P>

<P>I have ever allowed, that there are &s;everal glorious points in the charac|ter of John&s;on: you have &s;eized and di&s;|played
<PB N="50" REF="73">
them very forcibly.&mdash;I perfectly comprehend your pointed addre&s;s to me concerning our old friends the Athe|nians. You allude to my having &s;aid, la&s;t night, that much as John&s;on had been celebrated for his intimate ac|quaintance with ancient literature, there is not a particle of true attici&s;m, or of Roman urbanity, in all his compo&s;itions. I really think &s;o&mdash;but of that when we come to &s;peak of his writings. At pre|&s;ent, I am to confine my&s;elf to his cha|racter as a man; and in that point of view, you mu&s;t forgive me for &s;aying, that however great his faculties and vir|tues may have been, they were evidently balanced by imperfections of equal mag|nitude and weight. As to your remark on the marvellous purity of your Mo|rali&s;t in dome&s;tic life, I will only make
<PB N="51" REF="74">
this &s;hort reply:&mdash;If I thought it decent or fair to pur&s;ue &s;uch a &s;crutiny, I am convinced, by the report of his a&s;&s;o|ciates, that we &s;hould find his early days as much di&s;graced by actual licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, as tho&s;e of my noble client, whom you have called a libertine.&mdash;But woe to the man, who from wanton or male|volent curio&s;ity, attempts to violate the &s;acred rece&s;&s;es of dome&s;tic privacy, for the mi&s;chievous &s;atisfaction of expo&s;ing the &s;ecret or forgotten &s;ins of the illu&s;|trious dead.

imperfections. The&s;e indeed were &s;o great, that whenever I review his character in my mind, he is one mo|ment an object of my idolatry, and the next of my abhorrence. For, if I re|collect what you have &s;o ju&s;tly com|mended, his noble readine&s;s to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, I remember al&s;o, that he was an ab&s;olute Cain, who could not bear to behold the accepted &s;acrifice of a brother. Indeed he a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated not a &s;ingle Abel, but continually levelled his murderous &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t the li|terary life of all his numerous brethren, the whole tribe of our contemporary au|thors. I believe it would be impo&s;&s;ible to name one of this tribe, to whom he ever gave a full and fair portion of prai&s;e untainted by envy; and if we re|view his poetical Biography, we &s;hall find

more touching te&s;t of merit can we de&s;ire for any character, than to find, that he was revered, even to idolatry, by his friends?

Pagan Sage, if his fair and elegant friend A&s;pa&s;ia had left us a little book of philo&s;ophical anecdotes, in which we might read, that the great philo&s;o|pher had rewarded her, for allowing him a noble apartment, and all the comforts of her magnificent hou&s;e, by teazing, with argumentative and impe|rious petulance, her good, aged mo|ther? What would the world have thought of him, if Xenophon had given us the narrative of an excur&s;ion, made to amu&s;e his in&s;tructive ma&s;ter, by &s;hewing him the bleak mountains of Thrace, and had told us, that when he pre&s;ented him to his venerable old father, who dwelt in that country, the Sage, in&s;tead of entertaining his re|&s;pectable ho&s;t with colloquial wi&s;dom, worried him &s;o ferociou&s;ly, that the

Again, I may &s;ay, what would the world have thought of him, if the &s;ublime Plato him&s;elf had repre&s;ented his admirable in&s;tructor as the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h and di&s;gu&s;ting glutton that ever appeared at a table? &mdash; Such are the points of view in which your favourite Morali&s;t has been exhibited to us by his various biographical a&s;&s;ociates. Your excellent memory, my good friend, will readily &s;ugge&s;t the pa&s;&s;ages to which I have alluded.

hero;&mdash;yet, what enemies could have contributed more to his degradation as a man, in the eyes of every candid and impartial reader?&mdash;I will not &s;ay it has happened by their fault; let us call it rather a fatality, for the accom|pli&s;hment of literary ju&s;tice &mdash; and it affords us an incentive to univer&s;al can|dour and benevolence, to contemplate the man, who had written the lives of many with a great portion of detractive malignity, de&s;tined to have memorials of him&s;elf &s;o written, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his friends, that his character mu&s;t &s;ink in the public e&s;teem, exactly as fa&s;t as their friendly records appear.</P>

either of morality or religion.&mdash;The ancient philo&s;ophers, who maintain, you know, that virtue is not to be taught without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a proper na|tural di&s;po&s;ition, would have not only denied his actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of con|&s;ummate virtue, but the po&s;&s;ibility of his acquiring it; &s;ince, in&s;tead of look|ing on the face of nature with true filial tenderne&s;s and gratitude, his gloomy &s;pirit made him regard her only as a malicious &s;tep-mother, who exerted her ingenuity to embitter his exi&s;tence. An affectionate delight in the vi&s;ible crea|tion, appears to me as nece&s;&s;ary to per|fect morals, as the &s;pring is to the per|fection of the year. How utterly de&s;ti|tute of that &s;entiment your great Mo|rali&s;t mu&s;t have been, we may clearly perceive by his indignation again&s;t an

Go&s;pel, in calling a brother fool.&mdash;I am as ready as you are, my good friend, to a&s;cribe both the gloomine&s;s and the a&s;perity of his mind and manners to the vitiated organs of his very wonderful frame&mdash;indeed, the more I contemplate his character, the more I am convinced that the di&s;temper which afflicted his body, if I may u&s;e a &s;criptural expre&s;|&s;ion, entered into his &s;oul. I am wil|ling, therefore, to con&s;ider his defects rather as misfortunes than as crimes; al|though they appear to have operated again&s;t his happine&s;s with the double force of calamity and of guilt. For, with uncommon powers to &s;upport ei|ther bodily or mental exerci&s;e&mdash;with all the advantages he derived from his &s;uc|ce&s;sful labour, and the liberal kindne&s;s of his more intimate admirers&mdash;he &s;eems
<PB N="80" REF="103">

Believe me, I am &s;o far from be|ing an enemy to his fame, that I heartily wi&s;h the public would di&s;cover a more liberal di&s;po&s;ition to pay him &s;epulchral honours. The &s;ub&s;cription for his mo|nument &s;eems to langui&s;h, in a manner that reflects di&s;grace on this opulent and poli&s;hed country. I wi&s;h, my good friend, that you and I knew how to quicken the munificence of the king|dom

Soldier, as I am, I a&s;&s;ure you, it is more plea&s;ant to me, on this occa&s;ion, to defend than to attack. Let me turn therefore from your re&s;pected Morali&s;t, and ha&s;ten to the vindication

<P>Surely not; for although it is certain tho&s;e excellent papers have all the &s;e|rious purity of a &s;ermon, yet they have al&s;o very different attractions. To me, the Ramblers exhibit a mental paradi&s;e, in which fancy and rea&s;on alternately entertain me with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new delights, under the guidance and pa|tronage of virtue and religion.

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mo&s;t readily admit, that the Ram|blers, from the evident de&s;ign of the writer, and from their intrin&s;ic merit
<PB N="85" REF="108">
in many points of view, have very &s;trong, and I &s;incerely hope they may prove &s;ucce&s;sful claims to immortality. Yet, as le&s;&s;ons on life and manners, there are many productions of the &s;ame cla&s;s, who&s;e influence on my heart and mind is not only more plea&s;ant, but more beneficial. To read the Rambler is, to my feelings, to walk through a &s;tupendous Egyptian temple of black marble, furni&s;hed with &s;ome Colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues of ebony, and with here and there a little grote&s;que image, very lamely copied from ordinary life. I perceive, at every &s;tep, a &s;trength and grandeur of conception in the dark fancy of the melancholy architect. I perceive, al&s;o, that in the cour&s;e of his gloomy labour he had &s;hort fits of merriment, and that in tho&s;e &s;portive
<PB N="86" REF="109">
moments, he was &s;ingularly awkward and ungraceful. In the whole &s;tructure, there is an air of awful maje&s;ty, that always fixes my attention, and frequently enchants me; yet, at the end of my circuit through its various apartments, I feel rather depre&s;&s;ed and amazed, than animated and improved. Such is the effect which his mo&s;t con&s;iderable work produces upon me; and that many others have &s;urveyed it with &s;imilar feelings, we may conclude from what he tells us him&s;elf in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t paper. The book is in your hand; give me leave to read the &s;entence:&mdash;
<Q>Scarcely any man is &s;o &s;teadily &s;e|rious as not to complain, that the &s;everity of dictatorial in&s;truction has been too &s;eldom relieved, and that he is driven, by the &s;ternne&s;s of the

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;urely true, that the &s;erious air, and let me &s;ay the &s;ublime beauties of that production, were the chief ob&s;ta|cles to its immediate &s;ucce&s;s. Its merit was of too elevated a nature to be in|&s;tantly
<PB N="88" REF="111">
under&s;tood by the frivolous mul|titude:&mdash;but it has at length been fairly appreciated by time; and the great morali&s;t is now univer&s;ally read, not only for the dignity of his &s;entiments, but for the force and lu&s;tre of his lan|guage. For my own part, I exult in the growing influence of his genius; I am happy in &s;eeing it tend to the full di&s;charge of that glorious office, for which every great mind &s;hould think it&s;elf fa&s;hioned by Heaven; I mean, the office of diffu&s;ing the light of know|ledge and of virtue over millions of &s;pirits inferior to it&s;elf.</P>

by his bur&s;ts of &s;plendid &s;en|timent, I am &s;till more frequently dar|kened and depre&s;&s;ed by his thick vollies of &s;pleen. In all his writings, and in the Rambler particularly, he &s;eems to me to bear a great re&s;emblance to his own Su&s;pirius, the Screech-owl, whom he repre&s;ents, you know,
<Q>as &s;ettled in an opinion, that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of life is to complain, and who&s;e every &s;yllable was loaded with mi&s;|fortune.</Q>
&mdash; He would, indeed, be the mo&s;t meritorious of all morali&s;ts, if the merit of a preceptor con&s;i&s;ted in trying to teach mankind that their exi&s;tence is mi&s;ery. I own my&s;elf de|voted to more enlivening philo&s;ophy; for I could never find that wi&s;dom and virtue are acquired by catching the contagion of con&s;titutional melancholy,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet a man of your thoughtful turn, my dear Colonel, mu&s;t &s;urely allow, that in alluring men to pay a &s;erious attention to their duty, a writer takes the fir&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep towards making them better. It is not the gloom of melancholy, but the &s;olem|nity of religion, that gives &s;uch a &s;erious air to the compo&s;itions of John|&s;on; and, in&s;tead of blaming the phi|lo&s;opher, I think you ought rather to applaud the Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already &s;aid, that your Morali&s;t appears to me to have mi&s;taken the true
<PB N="91" REF="114">
&s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity in his manners, and I think &s;o no le&s;s in the tenor of his works, which, without mentioning tho&s;e that are envious and unju&s;t, have a general tendency to in&s;pire a dreary gloomine&s;s of &s;pirit. A &s;oldier perhaps, my dear reverend friend, may have formed very erroneous notions of &s;acred things, which he cannot have &s;tudied &s;ufficiently: but to my apprehen&s;ion, the true &s;pirit of our religion is more chearful than gloomy; for in what does Chri&s;tianity &s;urpa&s;s all the religions of the earth? not in its au&s;terity, not in its terror, but in its benignity, in its com|fort. It is chearful, becau&s;e it excites us to the mo&s;t attentive di&s;charge of tho&s;e tender and &s;ocial duties which cannot be duly di&s;charged without gen|tlene&s;s and joy. Other religions may
<PB N="92" REF="115">
animate the frame, by flattering &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ion; as the Alcoran, for in&s;tance, undoubtedly flatters the two pa&s;&s;ions of de&s;ire and ambition. But Chri&s;tianity, in my idea of it, accompli&s;h|es this end by the very oppo&s;ite means: it melts down all the pa&s;&s;ions, and ex|tracts from them the vivifying e&s;&s;ence of univer&s;al charity.&mdash;Forgive me for thus throwing out the rough concep|tions of a laical enthu&s;ia&s;t, on &s;o intere&s;t|ing a topic. I am &s;ure you will forgive me, becau&s;e I know we think alike, both on the importance and the benig|nity of our religion.</P>

<P>And let me remind you, my excellent friend, that our ideas agree al&s;o with tho&s;e of the great Author, whom you are

too ha&s;tily condemning. You &s;eem to have utterly forgot, that the Rambler contains not only as &s;ublime, but as chearful a picture of Chri&s;tianity as the human faculties can exhibit; pray re|collect the dream, in which a lovely figure exclaims&mdash;

aloud, the other day, to my &s;i&s;ter; and I remember, on our fini&s;hing the paper, we both regretted that Religion, when &s;he &s;ettled her&s;elf in the mind of John|&s;on, &s;eemed to have excluded the&s;e her three children from her hou&s;ehold. To religious joy he appears to have been almo&s;t a &s;tranger; he was not favoured with very long or very frequent vi&s;its from religious hope; and that religious benevolence, which we frequently ad|mire, as the immediate director of his pen, was continually overpowered and &s;truck dumb by the &s;tronger voices of his more con&s;tant companions, pride, envy, and &s;pleen. I allow you, that few authors have written with a more reli|gious ca&s;t of mind than your Morali&s;t; yet &s;urely he di&s;gu&s;ts his reader, not by being too much, but too little of a
<PB N="95" REF="118">
Chri&s;tian. Religion has &s;ometimes an effect &s;imilar to what is imputed to wine; in&s;tead of giving new di&s;po&s;itions to the mind, it &s;trengthens and calls forth the humour it happens to meet, whether good or bad: thus the natural ferocity of John&s;on is &s;een to mount in a religious blaze, when, in his ramble among the &s;acred ruins of Scotland, his imagina|tion delights it&s;elf in conceiving that a ruinous &s;teeple may fall, to cru&s;h the po&s;terity of the Scotti&s;h Reformer. Surely, &s;aid a friend of ours, when he fir&s;t &s;aw that anecdote of John&s;on, this man wanted only the lot of being born in Spain, when the inqui&s;ition was e&s;|tabli&s;hed, to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed as the mo&s;t black-minded and bloody &s;upporter of that barbarous tribunal.</P>

<PB N="99" REF="122">
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely there is &s;ome degree of courte&s;y in allowing his name to &s;tand on the li&s;t of poets, for having written the mo&s;t frigid and unintere&s;ting tragedy that can be &s;elected from all the languages of the earth; and a forcible imitation of a declamatory Satiri&s;t. He thought him|&s;elf indeed a great poet; and tried to bully the public into the &s;ame opinion, by the clo&s;e of the arrogant prologue to his Irene:
<Q><L>In rea&s;on, nature, truth he dares to tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Ye fops be &s;ilent, and ye wits be ju&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>This would have been bold language for any writer to have u&s;ed, in &s;peaking of his mo&s;t fortunate production; but what is it, when applied to a perform|ance
<PB N="100" REF="123">
which, in&s;tead of being in&s;pired by his boa&s;ted patrons, Rea&s;on, Nature, and Truth, appeared to be rather the work of fal&s;e, unfeeling art, and of pompous ab|&s;urdity?&mdash;His critical bitterne&s;s may be partly a&s;cribed to his great dramatic di&s;appointment. Having utterly failed in his prime ambition to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, and make his fortune as a poet, he conceived an eternal hatred to the whole tribe of poets; and, unluckily for that tribe, his powers of defaming poe|tical merit were as &s;trong as his power to equal it was feeble. And hence, as I lately heard, a cen&s;urer of his criti|ci&s;m altered a title-page to his Lives of the Poets, and called them,
<Q>The Lives of the triumphant Angels, written by Lucifer the fallen.</Q>

<SP>

<P>Yet &s;urely not a dwarf in that fa|culty, which is &s;aid to con&s;titute a poet&mdash;I mean, imagination.&mdash;One of his friends has told us, you know, and I think very truly,
<Q>His mind was &s;o full of imagery, that he might have been perpetually a poet.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="103" REF="126">
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>We find he made the experiment, and could never be &s;o completely.&mdash; His late&s;t biographer, indeed, &s;eems aware of his poetical and his critical failure, and appears to apologize for both, by &s;uppo&s;ing, that he is
<Q>to be numbered among tho&s;e poets, in whom the powers of under&s;tanding, more than tho&s;e of the imagination, are &s;een to exi&s;t.</Q>
&mdash;But &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;i|tion affords us no very favourable or ju&s;t e&s;timate of the talents that really belonged to this wonderful being; for even the enemies of John&s;on mu&s;t al|low, that a very vigorous, and a very quick imagination, was one of his mo&s;t &s;triking characteri&s;tics. The truth, I believe, is, however paradoxical it may &s;ound, that a writer may po&s;&s;e&s;s the
<PB N="104" REF="127">
faculty of imagination in a high de|gree, and yet prove him&s;elf a mi&s;erable poet. Let any one try to read the Irene of John&s;on, and he will be per|fectly convinced of this truth. There are fine images, elevated &s;entiments, and &s;plendid language; yet the per|formance produces only languor and di&s;gu&s;t, becau&s;e the author was utterly de&s;titute of that &s;en&s;ibility, which alone can enable a writer to awaken intere&s;t and pathos.

Such inability, I think, attended John&s;on, both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e. Yet, with all that deficiency, I feel he had faculties which ju&s;tly make him an object of ad|miration.

<P>I have already declared my opinion, that the imagination of John&s;on was of the highe&s;t cla&s;s. It was, indeed, a diamond; but, like the rarity that I lately read an account of in that excel|lent phy&s;ician and philo&s;opher, Dr. Lewis, it was a black diamond, and malevolent melancholy was the <HI>foulne&s;s</HI>

You may tell me, that we ought to treat this melancholy with tenderne&s;s, becau&s;e it was an hereditary misfortune; in that point of view, every per&s;on of common humanity mu&s;t be inclined to pardon and to pity its effects. But let not the quality, which was an infirmity in the man, be e&s;teemed as a perfection in his works. His Ra&s;&s;elas, like the greater part of his other compo&s;ition, leaves a heavy and uncomfortable gloom upon the mind. You will tell me, perhaps, that the author wi&s;hed to produce a very &s;erious effect, and that it con&s;titutes a part of
<PB N="109" REF="132">
his &s;uperlative moral merit, to have converted that idle or mi&s;chievous thing, called a romance, into a &s;alutary book. &mdash;It may be &s;o.&mdash;I can, indeed, con|ceive, that the old proverb concerning meat and poi&s;on, may be as true con|cerning books, our intellectual food, as it certainly is in regard to our ordi|nary diet.

<P>Severely as you have treated John|&s;on, both as a poet and a noveli&s;t, there is yet one character in which you mu&s;t allow him to &s;tand &s;uperior to every antagoni&s;t. He was not, indeed, the greate&s;t poet, or the mo&s;t intere&s;ting noveli&s;t, that ever wrote; but, as a critic, he has no equal. His Lives of the Poets, though not free from little defects, and inclining, perhaps, to an exce&s;s of &s;everity in a few articles, yet contain a ma&s;s of critici&s;m, &s;uperior, perhaps, to all the united critical la|bours of the ancient and modern world. Different objections may be made to

It has all the powers that the head can give; it has none of the charms that the heart only can &s;upply.

<P>The malignity of your Critic towards Milton, fell rather on the man than the poet&mdash;and for this, you know, he has been very ju&s;tly cha&s;ti&s;ed. There is a &s;anctity in the poetical character of Mil|ton, which &s;ecured it again&s;t any gro&s;s violation, from a per&s;on who piqued him&s;elf on his piety; yet in his account of this religious bard, your Morali&s;t has contrived to in&s;ert a few malevolent remarks, infinitely more applicable to him&s;elf as an author, than to the &s;ub|lime
<PB N="118" REF="141">
and tender poet whom he dete&s;ted. &mdash;Let me read you my evidence.</P>
<Q><P>Milton never learned the art of do|ing little things with grace; he over|looked the milder excellence of &s;ua|vity and &s;oftne&s;s; he was a lion that had no &s;kill in dandling the kid.</P>

To me it ap|pears to hit the tumid Rambler him&s;elf, &s;o forcibly, that if any man were to at|tempt a &s;mall, but &s;trong caricatura of John&s;on as an author, I que&s;tion if he could produce one with &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance as this very paragraph ex|hibits.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="159">And now, my good friend, ingenu|ou&s;ly &s;ay, have I not convinced you, that John&s;on, in pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence on our great poets, in&s;tead of fairly repre&s;ent|ing their petty failings, has frequently delineated his own heavier defects, and a&s;cribed them to &s;pirits of a higher cla&s;s, to whom they could not belong?</P>

<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have (I mu&s;t own) convinced me, that he was frequently unju&s;t; but I am &s;till inclined to impute that in|ju&s;tice, rather to the keenne&s;s and &s;trength, than to the malignity of his mind. I am per&s;uaded he always &s;poke as he felt; but he felt blemi&s;hes too forcibly, from the rigid integrity of his acute under&s;tanding. Whenever he blames, I believe you may di&s;cover
<PB N="137" REF="160">
&s;ome little foundation for his cen&s;ure; but he builds, perhaps, too large a &s;tructure on too trifling a ba&s;is. I cannot better explain to you my idea on this point, than by applying to him a lively couplet of Dr. Young:
<Q><L>His judgment ju&s;t, his &s;entence over &s;trong;</L>
<L>Becau&s;e he's right, he's ever in the wrong.</L></Q></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! &mdash; if you acknowledge him to be in the wrong, I will allow you to e&s;timate, as you plea&s;e, the moral rectitude of his perceptions. My own idea of him, as a critic, is this:&mdash;His ill-nature, or, if you wi&s;h for a &s;ofter expre&s;&s;ion, his &s;pleen, had, I think, a micro&s;copic eye, which, whenever it happened to glance on a
<PB N="138" REF="161">
freckle in the face of any luckle&s;s mu&s;e, immediately made it a cancer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>If, as a critic, he was too &s;evere, his &s;everity may &s;till produce a very u&s;eful effect on the trifling vagrants of Parna&s;&s;us, by exciting them to think with more energy. And, let me add, he has one critical merit, which de&s;erves the highe&s;t commendation; I mean, the merit of having re&s;cued the dramatic mu&s;e from tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive and three|fold fetters, <HI>The Unities.</HI></P>
<P>The demolition of a perplexing poe|tical &s;uper&s;tition, which had been &s;ancti|fied by the reverence of ages, was the work of a noble under&s;tanding, very worthily employed, and a work that
<PB N="139" REF="162">

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heartily join with you in this ap|plau&s;e, though, in general, I have little veneration for your Philo&s;opher in his critical capacity. It is Sir Henry Wotton, I think, who has called cri|tics the bru&s;hers of noblemen's clothes; and, if his metaphor is ju&s;t, we may &s;ay that John&s;on, like a heavy-handed valet, has executed this office with &s;uch vehemence, as fretted to pieces the fine raiment of his ma&s;ters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, you are too &s;evere!&mdash;But how great &s;oever you may repre&s;ent the mi&s;|takes of John&s;on, in points that belong
<PB N="140" REF="163">
&s;olely to ta&s;te and &s;entiment (on which, perhaps, we could hardly find any two minds in perfect uni&s;on) the great and &s;olid portion of his merit mu&s;t &s;till remain entire. He &s;trikes me like a venerable oak, which, though it may di&s;cover a few blighted leaves, and a little dead wood, perhaps, in the extre|mity of its branches, has a noble, &s;ound trunk, of the mo&s;t valuable tex|ture. The world, &s;urely, owes no little re&s;pect to a writer, who not only la|boured for many years, with great &s;in|cerity and fervour, to improve their morals, but exerted his rare faculties for that purpo&s;e with &s;uch con&s;tant rectitude of mind, with &s;uch uncom|mon cha&s;tity of thought and expre&s;&s;ion, that I que&s;tion if his numerous works contain a &s;ingle word or allu&s;ion, which

<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a very treacherous antago|ni&s;t, in attempting to injure me &s;o bar|barou&s;ly in the opinion of our judge. &mdash;But the equity of Lady Caroline is not to be corrupted or mi&s;led. She will clearly perceive that you draw a very unwarrantable inference from what I advanced. Indelicacy is not the only
<PB N="142" REF="165">
offence in a writer by which a lady can be di&s;gu&s;ted. As far as Lord Che&s;ter|field is concerned, I can, indeed, be|lieve that this offence was alluded to; for your dainty refiner of our manners abounds, I think, in &s;uch indelicate images, as are mo&s;t likely to di&s;gu&s;t a mind &s;o pure as that in que&s;tion. But whenever Lady Caroline was di&s;gu&s;ted by John&s;on, it was, I am convinced, by a defect very different from inde|licacy, yet a defect of which &s;he is equally qualified to judge&mdash;I mean, his critical inju&s;tice.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is not &s;ufficiently hone&s;t, or, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, &s;he is too delicate her&s;elf to confe&s;s, and demon&s;trate to you, the contrary; but I will, on this

occa&s;ion, be her interpreter. &mdash; There is, undoubtedly, a great degree of &s;uch purity as you have ju&s;tly prai&s;ed in the writings of John&s;on; yet, immaculate as you think him, I can &s;hew you a &s;entence in his biography, which is, perhaps, both the mo&s;t cruel and the mo&s;t indecent &s;entence that ever fell from the pen of a &s;erious writer; and I am per&s;uaded this very pa&s;&s;age was in my &s;i&s;ter's thoughts, when &s;he made u&s;e of the word <HI>di&s;gu&s;ted.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here it is, in the volume that lies open before us.&mdash;It relates to the un|fortunate lady &s;o pathetically lamented by Pope&mdash;you remember her hi&s;tory; I will only read the biographer's ob&s;er|vation upon it.</P>
<Q>From this account, given with evident intention to rai&s;e the lady's character, it does not appear that &s;he had any claim to prai&s;e, nor much to compa&s;&s;ion. She &s;eems to have been impatient, violent, and ungovernable: her uncle's power could not have la&s;ted long; the hour of liberty and choice would have come in time. But her de&s;ires were too hot for delay; and &s;he
<PB N="145" REF="168">
liked &s;elf-murder better than &s;u&s;|pen&s;e.</Q>
<P>What &s;ay you, my good friend, to the clo&s;e of this paragraph?&mdash;I doubt if the pen of Aretine him&s;elf ever de|lineated the rage of incontinence with gro&s;&s;er or more di&s;gu&s;ting energy. &mdash; There is a &s;avage barbarity, to my feelings, in this pa&s;&s;age, that I want words to expre&s;s. It brings to my fancy the image of a cannibal, who, in finding the cor&s;e of an unhappy, &s;elf-&s;laughtered girl, in&s;tead of breathing over it a natural &s;igh of compa&s;&s;ion, tears the haple&s;s body to pieces, with a ferocious, &s;arca&s;tic in&s;ult on the poor unfortunate being, who, in a fit of di&s;traction, had made her&s;elf his prey. Your great Morali&s;t is the more in|excu&s;able
<PB N="146" REF="169">
in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e the un|fortunate Lady, in&s;tead of being &s;o out|rageou&s;ly eager to gratify her de&s;ires, appears, I think, to have been a tender penitent, not immured in a convent by the tyranny of a relation, but a volun|tary reclu&s;e, who wi&s;hed perhaps, but found her&s;elf unable, to atone for pa&s;t frailties by a long per&s;everance in &s;oli|tude and prayer.</P>

<P>I know it; but I put no tru&s;t in the petty tales, which are &s;o confidently re|corded
<PB N="147" REF="170">
by the chroniclers of every idle hear&s;ay. I cannot, indeed, perfectly vouch for the truth of my de&s;cription, but I can &s;hew you it has the colouring of pro|bability. You may recollect, Pope him&s;elf tells us, in a note to his pa|thetic elegy, that the Lady was the &s;ame per&s;on to whom the Duke of Bucking|ham had addre&s;&s;ed a copy of ver&s;es on her de&s;ign of retiring into a mona&s;tery. I will endeavour to repeat to you a few lines of the Duke's poetry, and, luckily for his Grace's poetical credit, and my recollection, the lines I am trying to re|member are the be&s;t in the poem.&mdash; O! I have ju&s;t recovered enough for my argument.&mdash;The Duke de&s;cribes a tender, enchanting mi&s;tre&s;s on the point of tearing her&s;elf from the arms of her
<PB N="148" REF="171">
happy lover, in a &s;udden gu&s;t of devo|tion, and proceeds thus;
<Q><L>And after all our vows, our &s;ighs, our tears,</L>
<L>My bani&s;h'd &s;orrows and your conquer'd fears,</L>
<L>So many doubts &s;o many dangers pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Vi&s;ions of zeal mu&s;t vanqui&s;h me at la&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such are the grounds on which I re|pre&s;ented this haple&s;s fair as a di&s;tracted penitent, in&s;tead of an outrageous wan|ton; and if you con&s;ider the force of the pa&s;&s;ionate ver&s;es I have quoted, you will &s;urely allow, that my conjecture is more &s;pecious, at lea&s;t, than the im|probable &s;tory, that &s;he was in love with Pope. At all events, the Biographer
<PB N="149" REF="172">
has treated her barbarou&s;ly.&mdash;I have heard, that he was intreated to cancel the pa&s;&s;age, while the proof &s;heets were before him, on account of its indecency and its inju&s;tice; but that he per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;avage re&s;olve to &s;tigmatize the un|fortunate Lady, that he might not lo&s;e an opportunity of &s;hewing how truly he abhorred the crime of &s;uicide; to the verge of which, his own melancholy, I believe, had often conducted him.</P>

I grant you every thing you can wi&s;h, as to the &s;evere and gro&s;s appearance of the pa&s;&s;age you con|demn. I will allow you, it is a &s;entence at which the cheek of a truly virtuous woman may turn crim&s;on, not only from wounded mode&s;ty, but from an hone&s;t womanly indignation, in beholding &s;o

He mu&s;t have thought in this manner: "I have written a &s;en|tence, that is &s;aid to violate the ela|borate purity of my moral compo&s;i|tions, a &s;entence over which envy and malevolence will exult, and at which decency her&s;elf may be di&s;|gu&s;ted;&mdash;but I know by what in&s;idious &s;teps the demon of melancholy may lead a poor idle girl, who&s;e affections perhaps are wi&s;ely thwarted, to the
<PB N="152" REF="175">
precipice of &s;uicide. &mdash; If her piety will not &s;ave her, yet her pride may be rendered the in&s;trument of her pre&s;ervation.&mdash;I may re&s;emble the an|cient legi&s;lators, who, to &s;top the con|tagious pa&s;&s;ion for this crime among the women of their city, expo&s;ed the naked body of the &s;elf-murder|ed female. The &s;entence objected to, may check &s;ome unhappy woman on the verge of &s;uicide, by &s;hewing her how gro&s;s an interpretation the crime &s;he meditates may receive.&mdash;Let the delicacy of millions be offended, if I can &s;ave but the life of one:&mdash;What are cen&s;ure and applau&s;e to a writer, when put in the &s;cale again&s;t &s;uch a po&s;&s;ibility?&mdash;my heart tells me, they are du&s;t in the balance."</P>

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe the creative influence of regal power could much &s;ooner make a John&s;on than a Che&s;terfield. The com|mand of a prince can, indeed, produce elaborate language, and ambitious mo|rality; but genuine wit, and &s;portive urbanity, are &s;o far from being <HI>creatible</HI> (if I may create a word) by the will of a monarch, that they very rarely con|de&s;cend to appear in his pre&s;ence. Per|haps they never appeared at court to &s;o much advantage, as in the character of Che&s;terfield. I que&s;tion if they were ever united to more political integrity; and how happily they may &s;ometimes accompli&s;h the irk&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of gra|ver argument, we have a plea&s;ant in|&s;tance, in the anecdote of the noble

Lord's prevailing on the king to fill up a commi&s;&s;ion with a name, which he had rejected with dete&s;tation. It was in 1747, when the Earl was Secretary of State.

<P>Nor can I permit you, my dear and re&s;pected opponent, to a&s;&s;ume as in|conte&s;tible an opinion, which &s;ome hone&s;t people, indeed, have a&s;&s;umed too ha&s;tily&mdash;that John&s;on was a com|pound of every thing that is morally good, and Che&s;terfield of every thing that is morally evil.&mdash;If I can &s;hew
<PB N="164" REF="187">
you, that the accompli&s;hed Earl had in truth as much wi&s;dom and virtue as the arrogant Philo&s;opher, with his own rich inheritance of native wit into the bargain, you mu&s;t certainly allow him to be the more admirable character of the two. That he was, indeed, nei|ther le&s;s wi&s;e nor le&s;s virtuous than John&s;on, is &s;ufficiently evident to me, from a little &s;urvey that I have taken of what I may call the morning and the evening in the lives of each.&mdash;Let me &s;et the two men before you, for an in|&s;tant, in tho&s;e &s;triking periods of their exi&s;tence. At the age of thirty, a &s;ea&s;on when the fir&s;t whirlwind of the pa&s;&s;ions has &s;ub&s;ided, and the mind of man begins to a&s;&s;ume a &s;ettled temperature, how do we find John&s;on employed? Why truly, in writing a rebellious
<PB N="165" REF="188">
pamphlet, which his very biographer repre&s;ents as mean in its execution, and dete&s;table in its de&s;ign.&mdash;Now let me direct your eyes to Che&s;terfield, at the &s;ame age.&mdash;What was the noble Lord doing at thirty? In this year of his life, I find him giving an early example of that generous integrity, which he maintained through every &s;tage of his political career&mdash;and politely rejecting the advice of tho&s;e, who recommended it to him to increa&s;e the profits of a po&s;t that he had ju&s;t accepted, by &s;elling the &s;ubordinate places in his di&s;po&s;al. You may tell me, perhaps, that &s;uch an early compari&s;on of the two men, in a point of political purity, con&s;ider|ing the difference of their birth and &s;tation, is neither candid nor ju&s;t. Let us look then at the two veterans, when

each was turned of &s;eventy, when both were preparing to quit the &s;tage of life, the Philo&s;opher weary of having in|&s;tructed the world, and the Wit of having enlivened it. At &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, if the Philo&s;opher had indeed been a man of &s;ound wi&s;dom and virtue, we might expect to find him calmly and chearfully looking forward to an im|mortal reward for the benefits which his labour had be&s;towed upon mankind; and if the gayer life of the Wit had in truth been a mere ti&s;&s;ue of vice and folly, we might expect al&s;o to behold him, at this important &s;ea&s;on, &s;inking under the dread of a tremendous re|tribution.

bequeathed to us an invaluable legacy of the &s;ublime&s;t moral in&s;truction; and the Wit, however decorated by per&s;onal dignities, has left us little more than an elegant manual of profligate advice, &s;o improperly addre&s;&s;ed by a parent to his child, that it has ju&s;tly excited a ge|neral murmur of abhorrence.</P>

O that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed indeed that divine talent of eloquence which your laughingly a&s;cribe to me, and for which I am &s;o little fa&s;hioned by nature or education! Were I really ma&s;ter of
<PB N="173" REF="196">
that enchanting power, I hardly know a &s;ubject on which I &s;hould more delight to employ it, than in doing ju&s;tice to a man who de&s;erved &s;o highly of this nation, and who&s;e character has been &s;o ba&s;ely degraded.&mdash;We talk of the fre|quent cruelty and inju&s;tice of Athens, to the virtue that defended her walls, and to the talents that immortalized her glory; but I que&s;tion if ever any meritorious Athenian ever experienced &s;uch po&s;thu|mous ingratitude (if I may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion) from his capricious fellow|citizens, as Che&s;terfield has received from us. Let me remind you, that he was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed, for half a century, as one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed charac|ters in this kingdom. He &s;erved his country as an amba&s;&s;ador in Holland; and made the pure&s;t characters of that
<PB N="174" REF="197">
republic his friends. He &s;erved his country as a governor of Ireland, at a period of great difficulty and danger; and his virtues appeared to expand with his power. He &s;erved his country as a mini&s;ter at home; and nobly quitted his place, the moment he found it incon|&s;i&s;tent with his integrity and honour. He re&s;igned, not to indulge him&s;elf in factious turbulence, but in literary re|tirement. Study and conver&s;ation were, indeed, among his favourite amu&s;e|ments, at every &s;ea&s;on of life; for the native ca&s;t of his character was rather gentle than vehement; and he oppo&s;ed his enemies rather with gaiety than ran|cour. In the cour&s;e of a bu&s;y and &s;plendid life, he found time to write a few periodical le&s;&s;ons on life and man|ners, in which he equalled the fir&s;t au|thors
<PB N="175" REF="198">
in that branch of literature; and, having &s;ufficiently proved his ta&s;te, by his own admirable productions, he was univer&s;ally regarded as the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed patron of letters. His manners, and his wit, were &s;o engaging, that he was long e&s;teemed the chief or|nament and delight of &s;ociety, and the eminent characters of every country in Europe appeared ambitious of his ac|quaintance and regard. His latter days were embittered with many bodily infir|mities, which he &s;upported, however, with a chearful and religious philo&s;ophy, in con&s;idering this life as a fugitive dream, that he did not wi&s;h to renew, and in thinking of his Creator, as he tells his bo&s;om friend, the good Bi&s;hop of Waterford, with more hope than fear.&mdash; So lived and &s;o died the Earl of Che&s;ter|field,
<PB N="176" REF="199">
re&s;pected by the world, and ido|lized by his friends.&mdash;But a Lady, who had great rea&s;on to think well of the noble Lord, &s;eized the opportunity of his decea&s;e, to publi&s;h a collection of letters written for a very private and very particular purpo&s;e. She knew that they had been dictated by the parental tenderne&s;s of a good heart; and &s;he did not fore&s;ee, that the public could inge|niou&s;ly mi&s;interpret them, &s;o far as to call them the &s;ugge&s;tions of an evil &s;pirit; but, as there is a con&s;tant eager|ne&s;s in mankind to &s;eize, even the &s;light|e&s;t opportunity of degrading an exalt|ed name, as &s;oon as the&s;e letters were publi&s;hed, an outcry was rai&s;ed again&s;t them, by many hypocritical pretenders to goodne&s;s, and by many truly good people, who wanted either faculties or
<PB N="177" REF="200">
patience to form a fair e&s;timate of their author. Malevolent ridicule &s;cattered her gibes on the father, &s;o &s;olicitou&s;ly &s;triv|ing to improve the awkward per&s;on of his child; and mi&s;taken piety repre&s;ented him as a prodigy of wickedne&s;s, labour|ing to infu&s;e all his own follies and vices into his offspring, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a corrupt &s;y&s;tem of education, that would annihilate all the virtue of our country. But, after all, what is this ma&s;ter-piece of profligacy, when examin|ed by truth and candour? It is a &s;ingu|lar, and, in many points, the mo&s;t ad|mirable monument of paternal tender|ne&s;s and anxiety, that the literature of any nation can exhibit; it is a work, that, in&s;tead of corrupting our &s;ons, may ra|ther &s;timulate their parents to a quicker &s;en&s;e of their duty, by &s;hewing us, that

I have read thee with the eyes of a father, anxious not only for the temporal but the eternal intere&s;t of his children; and my heart tells me, that in the &s;ight of our great all-&s;eeing Parent, the work for which thou art vilified on earth mu&s;t have more of merit than of &s;in.</P>

<P>Is it candid, is it ju&s;t, or, I &s;hould ra|ther &s;ay, is it not the height of iniquitous cruelty, to give &s;o dark an interpreta|tion to idle raillery, in a familiar letter, which, like the je&s;ts of private conver&s;a|tion, &s;hould be con&s;idered only as the idle plea&s;antry of the moment?&mdash;To defend licentiou&s;ne&s;s, by &s;aying, it was recom|mended only in a country who&s;e cu&s;|toms appeared to give it a &s;anction, is an argument, which, though it may ex|tenuate the offence, is far from being, according to my ideas, the be&s;t vindica|cation that we may urge for the noble Lord.&mdash;All the immoral advice of Che&s;|terfield, may be compared to a drug,
<PB N="180" REF="203">
which, though it is rank poi&s;on if &s;wal|lowed indi&s;criminately by the multi|tude, may operate as an innocent and u&s;eful medicine to a particular patient.&mdash; The di&s;ea&s;e of young Stanhope, to pur|&s;ue the metaphor, was awkwardne&s;s in the extreme, and gallantry was the pre&s;crip|tion of Che&s;terfield. By giving his &s;on credit, in the&s;e private letters, for more influence over the fair than he was formed to attain, the father might mean no more, than to lead him fre|quently into &s;uch female &s;ociety as had the be&s;t chance of rendering him le&s;s an object of ridicule. Immorality of this kind, we hear every day in the &s;portive &s;allies of conver&s;ation between parents and children, where no real act of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s is intended, and where no cen&s;ure falls on the je&s;ting preacher of very &s;imi|lar

doctrine.&mdash;It is particularly cruel, to give the darke&s;t interpretation to the licentious levity of the&s;e motley letters, when the &s;ame corre&s;pondence affords us many &s;erious pa&s;&s;ages of the pure&s;t morality.&mdash;There is a double inju&s;tice in the common cen&s;ure on the&s;e ad|mirable letters:&mdash;they are condemned as a general &s;y&s;tem, when they were ex|pre&s;sly de&s;igned to correct the particular blemi&s;hes of an individual&mdash;they are condemned for not &s;peaking more of morality and religion, when the author informs us, he had intentionally left tho&s;e points to a worthy delegate.

<Q>Your moral character mu&s;t be not only pure, but, like Cae&s;ar's wife, un|&s;u&s;pected. The lea&s;t &s;peck or ble|mi&s;h upon it is fatal. Nothing de|grades and vilifies more; for it excites and unites dete&s;tation and contempt. There are, however, wretches in the world profligate enough to explode all notions of moral good and evil; to maintain that they are merely local, and depend entirely upon the cu&s;|toms and fa&s;hions of different coun|tries: nay, there are &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible,

Avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the company of &s;uch people; who reflect a degree of di&s;credit and infamy upon all who conver&s;e with them. But, as you may &s;ometimes by accident fall into &s;uch company, take great care, that no complai&s;ance, no good-hu|mour, no warmth of fe&s;tal mirth, ever make you &s;eem even to acquie&s;ce, much le&s;s to approve or applaud &s;uch infamous doctrines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Che&s;terfield's Letters to his Son, Letter 180.</NOTE>.</Q>

<P>The Ladies, in their laudable zeal for the honour of their &s;ex, are angry with Che&s;terfield, for repre&s;enting them as unable to keep a &s;ecret; but they forget the great object he had in view: it was to form a mini&s;ter for foreign courts; and his caution therefore, on this article, was only guarding his &s;on again&s;t tho&s;e in&s;inuating enemies, to which an Am|ba&s;&s;ador is particularly expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The noble Author is accu&s;ed of pre|ferring <HI>manners</HI> to <HI>morals.</HI> I intreat you to hear how ju&s;tly he maintains, in the following pa&s;&s;age, the pre-eminence of the latter.</P>
<Q><PB N="185" REF="208">Good manners are to particular &s;o|cieties, what good morals are to &s;ociety in general; their cement and their &s;e|curity&mdash;and, as laws are enacted to en|force good morals, or at lea&s;t to pre|vent the ill effects of bad ones, &s;o there are certain rules of civility uni|ver&s;ally implied and received to en|force good manners and puni&s;h bad ones: and indeed there &s;eems to me to be le&s;s difference, both between the crimes and the puni&s;hments, than at fir&s;t one would imagine. The im|moral man, who invades another man's property, is ju&s;tly hanged for it; and the ill-bred man, who by his ill man|ners invades and di&s;turbs the quiet and comforts of private life, is by common con&s;ent as ju&s;tly bani&s;hed &s;ociety. Mutual complai&s;ances, atten|tions,
<PB N="186" REF="209">
and &s;acrifices of little conveni|ences, are as natural an implied com|pact between civilized people, as pro|tection and obedience are between kings and &s;ubjects; whoever, in either ca&s;e, violates that compact, ju&s;tly for|feits all advantages ari&s;ing from it.

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks, &s;weet remembrancer! Let me look at my references for a moment, and I will proceed in due order. We propo&s;ed to compare Che&s;terfield and John&s;on in three different lights; fir&s;t, as men or citizens; &s;econdly, as periodi|cal lecturers on life and manners; and la&s;tly, as writers, in point of &s;tyle.&mdash; Since I find the Archdeacon is too candid in his own &s;entiments, or too indulgent to my opinion of the party I am defend|ing, to dwell with great vehemence on the charge again&s;t my client, I &s;hall conclude my de&s;ultory pleading, by a few brief ob&s;ervations, arranged under
<PB N="192" REF="215">
the three heads I have mentioned, re|que&s;ting my worthy friend to correct me where I am gro&s;sly mi&s;taken; and I &s;hall then entreat your Lady&s;hip to favour us with your frank and genuine &s;entiments on the two characters in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with pointing out to you a very &s;triking difference between Che&s;terfield and John&s;on, in an article which I con&s;ider as a great te&s;t of an amiable heart, I mean, Friend&s;hip. From the letters of the noble Lord to the Bi&s;hop of Waterford and Mr. Day|rolles, it is evident, that he took the mo&s;t lively intere&s;t in all the concerns of tho&s;e two valuable men.&mdash;Indebted as they both were to his patronage, and inferior to him in talents, he never &s;peaks to them in a tone of &s;u|periority,
<PB N="193" REF="216">
but upon every occa&s;ion as a &s;incere and &s;ympathetic friend. Pray ob&s;erve, from the following pa&s;&s;age in this corre&s;pondence, how the &s;uppo&s;ed advocate for univer&s;al licentiou&s;ne&s;s in youth, &s;peaks to tho&s;e he loved on the education of their children.</P>
<Q>A father's care of his &s;on's morals and manners, is &s;urely more u&s;eful than the critical knowledge of Homer and Virgil, &s;uppo&s;ing that it were, which it very &s;eldom is, acquired at &s;chools: I do not, therefore, he&s;itate to advi&s;e you, to put your &s;on to the be&s;t &s;chool, that is, the neare&s;t to your u&s;ual place of re&s;idence, that you may &s;ee and examine him often and &s;trictly, and watch his progre&s;s, not only in learning, but in morals and manners, in&s;tead of tru&s;ting to

intere&s;ted accounts of di&s;tant &s;chool|ma&s;ters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Twelfth Letter to the Bi&s;hop of Waterford.</NOTE>.</Q>
<P>But my e&s;teem for Che&s;terfield, in this point of view, is principally founded on his character of his bo&s;om friend, my Lord Scarborough, one of the mo&s;t beautiful and pathetic portraits of an amiable but unhappy mind, that was ever delineated by truth and tenderne&s;s; &s;o very beautiful, that I think no one can read the compo&s;ition, &s;hort as it is, without &s;aying of its author, This man had indeed a heart for friend&s;hip, and the talent of de&s;cribing tho&s;e he loved in the genuine language of na|ture.</P>
<P>Now turn to John&s;on.&mdash;In all his elaborate volumes, you di&s;cover no
<PB N="195" REF="218">
ve&s;tiges of his having enjoyed the in|e&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of true cordial friend|&s;hip; no marks of that fond and amiable gratitude, which has induced &s;o many great authors to delineate and immor|talize the per&s;ons who contributed to their happine&s;s or their glory. &mdash; It has been ob&s;erved, that he never pre|fixed a dedication to any one of his va|rious works; a circum&s;tance that ar|gues, to my apprehen&s;ion, not &s;o much an independent, as a proud, unfeeling, and &s;urly &s;pirit. For though dedications have too often con&s;i&s;ted of ba&s;e flattery to opulence and grandeur; they have frequently appeared as plea&s;ing and graceful offerings to friend&s;hip, and &s;ometimes as a proper tribute to parti|cular &s;tations. It is, I think, with equal malevolence and inju&s;tice, that John&s;on
<PB N="196" REF="219">
accu&s;es Addi&s;on of <HI>&s;ervile ab&s;urdity,</HI> in dedicating his Opera of Ro&s;amond to the Dutche&s;s of Marlborough, as the poet had exhibited, in a prophetic &s;cene of his drama, the very man&s;ion, of which the ju&s;t liberality of the kingdom had made this Lady the mi&s;tre&s;s. His in&s;cribing the Opera to her, was &s;urely an act of blamele&s;s and becoming ci|vility. This, indeed, is not the only in&s;tance of John&s;on's malignity to Ad|di&s;on, an author who&s;e life, who&s;e writ|ings, and who&s;e death, exhibit &s;uch abundance of the pure&s;t merit, that I can hardly think the man a true and perfect lover of genius or virtue, who &s;peaks of him in gro&s;s terms of &s;arca&s;tic contempt.</P>
<P>But to return to the article that I was &s;peaking of.&mdash;Had John&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="197" REF="220">
a heart for friend&s;hip, he mu&s;t have en|joyed all the reciprocal delights and ad|vantages of that ble&s;&s;ing, in his long connexion with Garrick.&mdash;They had &s;et out hand in hand, to make their way together through the chances of a world to which they were equally &s;trangers, and had jointly borrowed five pounds, in a moment of mutual di&s;tre&s;s, on the credit of the future Comedian. Such a circum&s;tance was almo&s;t &s;uffi|cient in it&s;elf to have made them &s;in|cere friends for ever, had their &s;ouls been of the true friendly temper; as there &s;eem to be few bonds of union more la&s;ting among men, than that of having pa&s;&s;ed through early hard&s;hips together. In my own profe&s;&s;ion, I have &s;een the force of this cement among our &s;oldiers very wonderfully exempli|fied.
<PB N="198" REF="221">
But there were other con&s;ide|rations that might have made John&s;on a cordial friend to Garrick. Their talents were of &s;o different a nature, that no rival&s;hip could exi&s;t between them; and accordingly we find Garrick, who was apt, indeed, to be alarmed at every &s;hadow of a rival in his profe&s;&s;ion, was ever ready to be&s;tow the mo&s;t hearty applau&s;e on the real merits of his old a&s;&s;ociate. Patient under his dogmatical a&s;perity, and indulgent to his humour, he almo&s;t revered and obeyed him as a parent; yet the &s;ple|netic &s;avage, un&s;oftened by this filial homage, had the barbarity to mortify this bo&s;om-friend of his early and in|digent days, by excluding him from a little club, to which he &s;ued for admi&s;&s;ion.

<P>You are running again, my good friend, into an exce&s;s of &s;everity. You forget that Garrick had his failings as well as John&s;on, perhaps greater fail|ings, without an equal counterpoi&s;e of perfection. By talents of a cla&s;s far in|ferior to tho&s;e of the Philo&s;opher, he had ri&s;en to the intoxicating joys of opulent &s;plendor, and is &s;aid, you know, to have in&s;ulted, by an o&s;tenta|tious di&s;play of his magnificence, his le&s;s fortunate old friend; who, like many other laborious men of letters, had been a drudge for years, without rai&s;ing a competence for the decline of life. For my own part, I never think of the&s;e two
<PB N="200" REF="223">
extraordinary men, without lamenting in my heart, that they &s;o little exerted the great powers which they both po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, of contributing to the happine&s;s and to the glory of each other. You know, my friend, that although I am in &s;ome points, as Lady Caroline calls me, an idolater of John&s;on, I am far from adopting his gloomy ideas of human life. On the contrary, I think our earth, which is often a plea&s;ant habitation as it is, would be for &s;ome years a delightful re&s;idence indeed, if every man &s;eized the opportunity of doing the noble things within his faculties to accompli&s;h, with|out indulging any malevolent or narrow|minded ideas.&mdash;For in&s;tance, had Gar|rick po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;oul, how happily might he have re&s;cued his old friend from deba&s;ing him&s;elf in the eyes of
<PB N="201" REF="224">
many, by the acceptance of that pen&s;ion to which he had ha&s;tily annexed, in his dictionary, &s;o odious a definition! How well might Garrick have &s;pared, from his ample revenue, an annuity of equal value! and how much would it have added to his reputation and delight, if he had employed a part of that wealth, which he derived from the partial libe|rality of the public, in &s;ecuring inde|pendence, not only to the friend of his youth, but to a mighty genius, who, from the peculiar infelicities that belong to author&s;hip, could hardly earn more than his daily bread by &s;uch exertions of intellect as do honour to his country!</P>

<P>Surely, to have accepted &s;o large a gratuity from a &s;ubject, however exalted, mu&s;t have been utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="203" REF="226">
the dignity of John&s;on. In receiving a pen&s;ion from a &s;overeign, who has fre|quently &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to correct the inju&s;tice of fortune towards literary genius, he had the &s;anction of cu&s;tom and of propriety in his favour.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>As this is a point that depends chiefly on delicacy of feeling, you are probably in the right; though, I confe&s;s, I cannot agree with you.&mdash;But allow me to re&s;ume my argument. It is clear that John&s;on did not love Garrick, though he had many rea&s;ons to do &s;o; and it is equally clear, that the incurable envy of your moral Philo&s;opher was the cau&s;e. I want no additional proof that he was utterly unfit for true la&s;ting friend&s;hip. The friends of an envious man can have
<PB N="204" REF="227">
no &s;ecurity for the continuance of his regard, but their own in&s;ignificance. If they happen, by any &s;ucce&s;sful talents, to improve their title to his affection, they will inevitably lo&s;e it.&mdash;An attempt to maintain a friend&s;hip with an envious character, will probably produce a di&s;|appointment very &s;imilar to what was lately felt by a naturali&s;t of my acquain|tance, who, intending to pre&s;erve a fa|vourite rarity in a bottle of pure &s;pirits, found it put by mi&s;take into a ve&s;&s;el of <HI>aqua fortis,</HI> which annihilated the trea|&s;ure that it was expected to pre&s;erve.</P>

<P>The force and aptitude of your &s;imile is a full vindication of my Philo&s;opher; for, while I agree with you, that envy is, in truth, a corro&s;ive of power &s;ufficient
<PB N="205" REF="228">
to annihilate friend&s;hip, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the long intimacy which John&s;on enjoyed with many re&s;pectable and cele|brated names, is a proof that if he was not perfectly exempt from this defect, its exi&s;tence only added to the triumphs of his virtue.</P>

<P>I cannot agree with you in your con|clu&s;ion; for I find no public traces of his having prai&s;ed the names you allude to, in the language of perfect affection; and &s;urely tho&s;e who have exhibited his character to the world, rather &s;peak of him as a prodigy they admired, than as a friend they loved. He was, in truth, &s;o great a prodigy, both in his facul|ties and his failings, that I hardly think it po&s;&s;ible for any man to have con|tracted
<PB N="206" REF="229">
an intimacy with him much &s;u|perior to the kind of friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between a &s;how-man and the lion that he exhibits. Indeed it has been ob&s;erved, that the favourite and mo&s;t adroit leader of the mon&s;ter, who ventured to &s;port with him mo&s;t fami|liarly, could not always withdraw him|&s;elf from his paw without &s;evere lace|ration.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The preference that your fancy gives to Che&s;terfield again&s;t John&s;on, &s;eems founded on your idea of your favourite's companionable attractions: yet &s;urely, if the merits of the men might be fairly e&s;timated by their powers of amu&s;ing a companion, the Earl could not triumph on this ground; for I apprehend his
<PB N="207" REF="230">
conver&s;ation, if compared to that of John&s;on, was like the &s;oothing murmur of a rill, compared to the maje&s;tic roar of a torrent.&mdash;As to mirth, no witty re|partee of the noble Lord, could more happily excite &s;urprize and laughter, than the lively &s;allies of John&s;on, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e.</P>
<P>But your imagination is &s;o much haunted by ideas of his ferocity, that you neither do ju&s;tice to his wit, nor to the acknowledged tenderne&s;s of his heart,&mdash; which was &s;o &s;ingularly humane, that I believe no author of his eminence ever afforded &s;o much literary a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e who implored it. Per&s;ons who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the public di&s;play of any talent, are apt, in general, to entertain an important &s;u&s;picious dread of deba&s;ing their dignity, by con|de&s;cending
<PB N="208" REF="231">
to employ them&s;elves in any petty work for a benevolent purpo&s;e.&mdash; From this frequent and ridiculous foible the great humanity of John&s;on com|pletely exempted him. Whenever &s;oli|cited by di&s;tre&s;s, he was ready, you know, to contribute either a prologue or a petition.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not &s;uppo&s;e me &s;o blind, or &s;o unju&s;t, as not to perceive and revere his &s;ignal readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t the wretched. He had, certainly, &s;incere and active compa&s;&s;ion for great calamities; but this is a ca&s;t of mind very different from that which leads a man to perfect ami|ty with the pro&s;perous and the eminent. A poet, who is more kind than &s;evere to

<P>This di&s;po&s;ition is indeed di&s;cerni|ble in every portrait of John&s;on; and &s;urely nothing can be more incompati|ble with the true &s;pirit of friend&s;hip. I conceive, therefore, that he entertained, for the per&s;ons who were mo&s;t beloved by him, &s;uch a &s;ort of regard as we may &s;uppo&s;e the Man-mountain to have be|&s;towed on tho&s;e half-flattered and half-frightened Lilliputians, whom he deign|ed to elevate in the palm of his hand; and for whom he &s;ometimes conde&s;cend|ed
<PB N="210" REF="233">
to &s;often the portentous &s;ound of his voice.</P>
<P>But let me ha&s;ten to my &s;econd arti|cle, and compare your Philo&s;opher with Che&s;terfield, as a periodical morali&s;t.</P>
<P>As our religion informs us, that it is very difficult for a rich man to find the way to heaven; &s;o may we conceive, that it is hardly le&s;s difficult for a man of quality, bu&s;ine&s;s, and fa&s;hion, to ren|der him&s;elf equal to our accompli&s;hed authors. He who was nur&s;ed by vanity, and tutored by pomp, de&s;erves, I think, no little prai&s;e, if he has delivered mo|ral lectures not inferior to tho&s;e of a philo&s;opher, who had adver&s;ity to teach, and poverty to in&s;pire him. In nam|ing poverty, I cannot help reminding you of your Philo&s;opher's very &s;ingular opinion, in regarding it as the only effi|cacious
<PB N="211" REF="234">
in&s;pirer; an opinion which induces me to believe, that, had he been born in the rank of Che&s;terfield, he would have proved, if not the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual, at lea&s;t the mo&s;t indolent of our modern voluptuaries. But, in the mid&s;t of many temptations to be idle and voluptuous, we find my noble favourite exerting his natural and acquired ta|lents to improve the morals of his countrymen; and I will venture to affirm, that the moral papers contained in his mi&s;cellaneous works, are full as well, if not better, calculated to an&s;wer their purpo&s;e, than tho&s;e pompous di&s;|&s;ertations of your Philo&s;opher, where the two authors afford the faire&s;t ground for a compari&s;on, in the &s;imilarity of their &s;ubject. As a &s;trong ca&s;e in point, I beg you to compare, at your lei&s;ure, the ad|mirable
<PB N="212" REF="235">
paper in Che&s;terfield, on the luxury of the table (which forms the &s;ixteenth number of a periodical work, intitled Common Sen&s;e) with the paper on gluttony in your favourite Rambler.&mdash;If you compare al&s;o the in|troductory number in each of the&s;e pub|lications, you will clearly perceive, I think, that the talents of Che&s;terfield were more &s;uited, than tho&s;e of John|&s;on, to the production of attractive and u&s;eful little lectures on life and manners. If you want farther proofs of this a&s;&s;er|tion, you may find them, I am per&s;uad|ed, in the papers that he contributed to <HI>The World,</HI> particularly tho&s;e on drink|ing, and civility, which live in the memory of every reader.&mdash;As Morali&s;ts, they &s;eem to bear the &s;ame relation to each other that exi&s;ts between the ele|gant,
<PB N="213" REF="236">
the penetrating Horace, and the forcible declamatory Juvenal. The en|gaging ea&s;e of Che&s;terfield's &s;tyle, and the &s;portive graces of his wit, were pecu|liarly adapted to render him excellent as the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t of a day. When they are compared together in this light, John|&s;on is to Che&s;terfield what the Piony is to the Ro&s;e&mdash;of a grander form, of more forcible and richer colouring, yet not &s;o plea&s;ant; to be &s;urveyed with di&s;tant admiration, but not eagerly received in|to the bo&s;om.</P>

<P>To &s;peak hone&s;tly, I could not in my con&s;cience attack my adver&s;ary on that ground; for I perfectly recollect that Lord Che&s;terfield repeatedly inculcates, not only the mo&s;t decent re&s;pect to re|ligion her&s;elf, but to all her mini&s;ters.

<P>I reverence you, my worthy friend, for this candour, and wi&s;h it were uni|ver&s;al.&mdash;Che&s;terfield is condemned as ir|religious; yet, &s;o far from finding any traces of this offence in his writings, I find, that in one of his French letters he expre&s;sly condemns the irreligion of
<PB N="216" REF="239">
Voltaire, partial as he was to that en|chanting writer, from a per&s;onal ac|quaintance.&mdash;Che&s;terfield is al&s;o con|demned as a Frenchified fop; yet no man has written more forcibly again&s;t our copying the follies of France. In|deed, no man &s;eems to have better un|der&s;tood or more highly valued the li|berties of his country; and with what &s;pirit he could &s;upport the manly frank|ne&s;s and undaunted truth of the Engli&s;h character, in &s;peaking to a Frenchman, we have a &s;triking example in his let|ter to the Abb&eacute; de la Ville, the French mini&s;ter at the Hague, on &s;everal par|ticulars relating to the battle of Fonte|noy. He has indeed been cruelly de|preciated. Your Philo&s;opher, you know, very mercifully con&s;idered him as a <HI>rot|ten po&s;t,</HI> to u&s;e his own gentle phra&s;e;
<PB N="217" REF="240">
but if there were &s;ome un&s;ound parts (and who is perfect?) in the character of the noble Lord, there was, I apprehend, a &s;till larger portion of touchwood in the Philo&s;opher him&s;elf.&mdash;I have never &s;een the letter in which he renounced the patronage, that he appeared to have contemplated with no little &s;atisfaction, but, from all the accounts that I have met with of that incident, I think we may rather blame the &s;plenetic pride of John&s;on, than the in&s;olence or mean|ne&s;s of Che&s;terfield.&mdash;In the &s;arca&s;ms which they levelled at each other, the latter &s;urely approaches neare&s;t to the truth: the Critic was unque&s;tionably more like a &s;avage than the Wit was like a dancing-ma&s;ter.&mdash;Che&s;terfield had his foibles and his vices. He was, in his early life, a &s;lave to the tyrannous vice

I allude to his conduct as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.&mdash;You know that he bani&s;hed gaming entirely from the ca&s;tle of Dublin; and &s;urely the man is entitled to credit for &s;ome noblene&s;s of mind, who enters on the exerci&s;e of &s;o|vereign power by the &s;acrifice of his own darling defect.&mdash;Believe me, I am not blind to his private failings, and I heartily wi&s;h, for his own happine&s;s, that they had never exi&s;ted; but I &s;till a&s;&s;ert, that he had public merit &s;ufficient to balance all his imperfections.

<P>A &s;evere parallel, indeed! methodi|cally drawn, and delivered with an oratorical vehemence that I never &s;aw you a&s;&s;ume before.&mdash;But, as I have ex|alted my&s;elf into a judicial office, let me imitate, my dear Colonel, the grand court of ju&s;tice among your favourite Athenians (as tho&s;e &s;apient judges al|ways &s;ate, I think, in the dark, you
<PB N="225" REF="248">
may allow me to be a little like them) and let me forbid all the delu&s;ive in&s;i|nuations of impa&s;&s;ioned eloquence.&mdash;I have &s;till to reque&s;t from you both, a few remarks on the &s;tyle of your re|&s;pective favourites.&mdash;The Archdeacon, I believe, e&s;teems John&s;on the very Samp&s;on of language, as we lately heard him called by one of his more affected admirers.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE ARCHDEACON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I think our lan|guage has infinite obligations to him; and the Colonel, who is a lover of &s;pirit in every &s;hape, can hardly prefer the loo&s;e and feeble phra&s;eology of Che&s;terfield, or of Addi&s;on, to the compact vigour of our energetic Phi|lologi&s;t.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though you may probably think me &s;everely prejudiced again&s;t your fa|vourite in &s;ome points, I tru&s;t you will not think &s;o in the article of diction: for I allow that we find frequent pa&s;&s;a|ges in John&s;on, where the amazing vigour of his expre&s;&s;ion is equalled by its beauty. I recollect, in his character of Dryden, a &s;entence that &s;hews us the wonderful powers of his language. He there de&s;cribes a tendency to talk non&s;en&s;e, in &s;uch terms as render it an object of great &s;ublimity. Do you re|member the words? I think they run thus:
<Q>He delighted to tread upon the brink of meaning, where light and darkne&s;s begin to mingle; to approach the precipice of ab&s;urdity,
<PB N="227" REF="250">
and hover over the aby&s;s of unideal vacancy.</Q>
&mdash;But there is an excel|lence which John&s;on has very ju&s;tly re|marked in Dryden's language, and which he greatly wanted him&s;elf. The excellence I mean, he de&s;cribes in a paragraph that I have tran&s;cribed in my memorandums, under the article we are &s;peaking of. Here it is:</P>
<Q>His &s;tyle could not ea&s;ily be imi|tated, either &s;eriou&s;ly or ludicrou&s;ly; for, being always equable, and al|ways varied, it has no prominent or di&s;criminative characters. The Beauty, who is totally free from di&s;proportion of parts and features, cannot be ridiculed by an over|charged re&s;emblance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Dryden.</NOTE>.</Q>
<P><PB N="228" REF="251">If the excellence of language may be e&s;timated by this &s;tandard, that of John&s;on is a&s;&s;uredly very defective; for nothing is more ea&s;y than to exe|cute a caricatura of his &s;tyle. In reading him, we are frequently tempted to exclaim, as La Bruyere does on certain &s;ermons, O! what a rich figure is the antithe&s;is! it produces a whole Rambler. With a great command of words, he certainly wanted the noble and graceful &s;implicity which we ad|mire in the capital writers of every country, from Homer, Plato, and De|mo&s;thenes, down to that Addi&s;on, whom the partizans of your Philo&s;opher call a weak writer when compared to John|&s;on; as there were once people in Rome, who preferred the eloquence of Seneca to that of Cicero.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="252">The language of Che&s;terfield &s;trikes me like a dam&s;el in a fa&s;hionable morning dre&s;s of the mo&s;t &s;imple and captivating elegance. That of John|&s;on, is like a matron who has arrayed her&s;elf for &s;ome grand ceremonial, and heightened the au&s;tere dignity of her form, by all the rich &s;tiffne&s;s of a flowery brocade.</P>
<P>If I were to compare the &s;tyle of your Philo&s;opher with that of Addi|&s;on, I &s;hould &s;ay, that John&s;on has the &s;pirit, the grandeur, and the monotony of the kettle-drum; Addi&s;on, the rich variety of that &s;acred in&s;trument, which can equally delight us with airy &s;weet|ne&s;s and awful &s;olemnity. But as I am no connoi&s;&s;eur in the mu&s;ic of lan|guage, perhaps my idea is not &s;o ju&s;t
<PB N="230" REF="253">
as the opinion of &s;ome good-natured critics upon &s;tyle, who, while they are rattling a &s;alt-box them&s;elves, have the kindne&s;s to tell their auditors, there is no &s;trength or body in the tones of an organ.</P>
<P>Let me return to the diction of Che&s;|terfield.&mdash;The be&s;t panegyric I can de|vi&s;e for it will be, to read you the fol|lowing paragraph, addre&s;&s;ed to him by your Philologi&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>I may hope, my Lord, that &s;ince you, who&s;e authority in our language is &s;o generally acknowledged, have commi&s;&s;ioned me to declare my own opinion, I &s;hall be con&s;idered as ex|erci&s;ing a kind of vicarious juri&s;dic|tion; and that the power which might have been denied to my own claim,
<PB N="231" REF="254">
will be readily allowed me as the de|legate of your Lord&s;hip <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John&s;on's Plan of an Engli&s;h Dictionary.</NOTE>.</Q>
&mdash;You will readily allow, my good friend, that the man mu&s;t have been no weak ma&s;|ter in the &s;cience of words, who could extort &s;uch a compliment from an au|thor uncommonly &s;paring of literary courte&s;y to all living merit.&mdash;But I will not launch out into new cen&s;ures on your idol. Indeed, as he has &s;o fre|quently excited my &s;pleen by his &s;eve|rity towards various favourites of mine, both in politics and poetry, I may po&s;|&s;ibly harbour prejudices again&s;t him, almo&s;t as violent and cruel as his own&mdash; you, I think, have as &s;trong a bias in his favour, from your benevolent pre|&s;umption, that his real goodne&s;s was as
<PB N="232" REF="255">
great as his o&s;tentatious di&s;play of mo|rality. But my &s;i&s;ter is a &s;ort of neutral power, who may fairly &s;ettle the dif|ference between us; and I am &s;ure you will join with me in reque&s;ting her to give us, I will not &s;ay her judgment, for the word would alarm and terrify her diffidence, but her genuine feelings to|wards the two characters in que&s;tion.</P>

<P>I join indeed mo&s;t heartily in your re|que&s;t; and beg leave, at the &s;ame time, to remind Lady Caroline, that &s;he is the true perfect judge, not only of moral but of literary merit, according to an hone&s;t and candid &s;entiment of the mighty Critic him&s;elf; who &s;ays, you know, in &s;peaking with liberal prai&s;e of Gray's Elegy,
<Q>By the common &s;en&s;e

<SPEAKER>LADY CAROLINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very good, to encourage me by &s;uch a quotation; but I really have not confidence enough to deliver any thing like a formal opinion upon cha|racters of &s;uch eminence, even to you with whom I am &s;o familiar. I do not mean, however, to &s;hrink entirely from your reque&s;t, which would, I think, be very unfair, after the entertainment that I have received from you both&mdash; and to pretend, that I have formed to my&s;elf no notions concerning two au|thors
<PB N="234" REF="257">
whom you know I read very fre|quently, would be a fooli&s;h &s;ort of pru|dery indeed: I &s;hall tell you therefore, very frankly, how I have felt my&s;elf affected by your re&s;pective favourites. &mdash;To &s;peak of them as men, I never felt in my life the &s;lighte&s;t wi&s;h to have been per&s;onally acquainted with either; though in reading many authors, and Addi&s;on in particular, I have felt &s;uch a de&s;ire.&mdash;John&s;on, I think, &s;aid to &s;ome young Lady,
<Q>Mi&s;s, I am a tame mon|&s;ter, you may &s;troke me.</Q>
If he &s;aid &s;o, for I do not recollect where I met with the anecdote, I apprehend his ex|pre&s;&s;ion was not perfectly true.&mdash;He certainly was not more than half-ta|med.&mdash;I do not believe that I could have been induced to give the fearle&s;s pat of friendly familiarity to either of the&s;e very oppo&s;ite creatures. I am per|&s;uaded,
<PB N="235" REF="258">
that my hand would have &s;hrunk from John&s;on, as from a hedge-hog; and from Che&s;terfield, if not as an adder too venomous to be touched, yet cer|tainly as an eel too &s;lippery to be held. For, notwith&s;tanding my brother's pa|negyric on the friendly qualities of his idol, I cannot think that either he or the Philo&s;opher had a heart truly formed for that tender connection. They &s;eem to me to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an equal degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, though it &s;hewed it&s;elf under very different &s;hapes&mdash;one was continually trying to bully, and the other to inveigle the world into an ex|clu&s;ive admiration of his particular ta|lents. The men accu&s;e our &s;ex of be|ing actuated by a &s;pirit of rival&s;hip and mutual inju&s;tice to each other. Yet &s;urely this is not only as vi&s;ible among
<PB N="236" REF="259">
them&s;elves, but more productive of gene|ral di&s;advantage. What the Archdeacon ob&s;erved of John&s;on and Garrick, leads me to make a &s;imilar ob&s;ervation on John&s;on and Che&s;terfield. Had the&s;e two men, of rare and different talents, in&s;tead of kindling into a contemptuous animo&s;ity, contracted a &s;olid friend&s;hip, on the noble plan of honouring, of en|joying the perfections and correcting the deficiencies of each other, how in|finitely might &s;uch conduct have con|tributed to the plea&s;ure, improvement, happine&s;s, and la&s;ting glory of both! But the defects in each were too &s;trong to let him derive all po&s;&s;ible delight and advantage from the faculties of the other. Great as they both were in their &s;eparate lines, I cannot think that either was truly entitled to the epithet of ami|able
<PB N="237" REF="260">
or good; for I am equally offended by truth that is delivered with brutality, and by politene&s;s that is utterly in&s;incere: I own my&s;elf as much an enemy to the &s;plenetic malevolence of John&s;on, as to the licentious vanity of Che&s;terfield. Could they have blended their better qualities; could the gaiety of the Wit have cured the &s;pleen of the Philo&s;opher; and, could the &s;trong intellect of John|&s;on have annihilated the libertini&s;m of Che&s;terfield, each might have been, what I think neither was, a truly accompli&s;hed and happy man: and each might have been rendered, by &s;uch a proce&s;s, a more perfect and delightful writer; for, as it is, though we admire the wonderful under&s;tanding and energy of mind di&s;|played by John&s;on, though we are charm|ed by the wit, elegance, and knowledge
<PB N="238" REF="261">
of the world, that we find in Che&s;ter|field, yet it is certain that each fails us in the very point where, from his par|ticular pur&s;uits, we might naturally &s;up|po&s;e it mo&s;t &s;afe to take him as a guide. The literary judgments of John&s;on, and the worldly admonitions of Che&s;ter|field, appear to me equally un&s;ound. The fir&s;t are, &s;urely, not con&s;i&s;tent with truth and ju&s;tice;&mdash;and for the latter, I am afraid no apologi&s;t can perfectly reconcile them to hone&s;ty and virtue. Yet there is &s;uch a ma&s;s of real, though different excellence, united to the gro&s;s failings of tho&s;e two authors, that, as a parent anxious to collect every thing that may render me u&s;eful to my child|ren, I read them both with equal eager|ne&s;s; and I find much innocent in&s;truc|tion in Che&s;terfield, that a mother's heart
<PB N="239" REF="262">
is inclined to adopt. Let rigid Moral|i&s;ts tell me, if they plea&s;e, that all his parental merit is of the womani&s;h kind; and that he is, at be&s;t,
<Q>Fine by defect, and delicately weak.</Q></P>
<P>As to John&s;on, I have indeed many jarring ideas of his excellencies and de|fects; yet, I believe, I may give you my notion of his character, comprized in a line, by which Pope has de&s;cribed the whole &s;pecies. I &s;hall conclude, there|fore, by telling you, that he was, to my apprehen&s;ion,
<Q>A Being darkly wi&s;e, and rudely great.</Q></P>
