<HEAD>THE CARPENTER; Or, the DANGER of EVIL COMPANY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE was a young We&s;t-country man,</L>
<L>A Carpenter by trade;</L>
<L>A &s;kilful wheelwright too was he,</L>
<L>And few &s;uch Waggons made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Man a tighter Barn cou'd build,</L>
<L>Throughout his native town,</L>
<L>Thro' many a village round was he,</L>
<L>The be&s;t of workmen known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His father left him what he had,</L>
<L>In &s;ooth it was enough;</L>
<L>His &s;hining pewter, pots of bra&s;s,</L>
<L>And all his hou&s;ehold &s;tuff.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A little cottage too he had,</L>
<L>For ea&s;e and comfort plann'd,</L>
<L>And that he might not lack for ought,</L>
<L>An acre of good land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A plea&s;ant orchard too there was,</L>
<L>Before his cottage door;</L>
<L>Of cider and of corn likewi&s;e,</L>
<L>He had a little &s;tore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Active and healthy, &s;tout and young,</L>
<L>No bu&s;ine&s;s wanted he;</L>
<L>Now tell me reader if you can,</L>
<L>What man more ble&s;t cou'd be?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To make his comfort quite compleat,</L>
<L>He had a faithful Wife;</L>
<L>Frugal and neat and good was &s;he,</L>
<L>The ble&s;&s;ing of his life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where is the Lord, or where the Squire.</L>
<L>Had greater cau&s;e to prai&s;e,</L>
<L>The goodne&s;s of that bounteous hand,</L>
<L>Which ble&s;t his pro&s;p'rous days?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each night when he return'd from work,</L>
<L>His wife &s;o meek and mild,</L>
<L>His little &s;upper gladly dre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>While he care&s;s'd his child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One blooming babe was all he had,</L>
<L>His only darling dear,</L>
<L>The object of their equal love,</L>
<L>The &s;olace of their care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O what cou'd ruin &s;uch a life,</L>
<L>And &s;poil &s;o fair a lot?</L>
<L>O what cou'd change &s;o kind a heart,</L>
<L>All goodne&s;s quite forgot?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With grief the cau&s;e I mu&s;t relate,</L>
<L>The di&s;mal cau&s;e reveal,</L>
<L>'Twas EVIL COMPANY and DRINK,</L>
<L>The &s;ource of every ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Cooper came to live hard by,</L>
<L>Who did his fancy plea&s;e;</L>
<L>An idle rambling Man was he,</L>
<L>Who oft had cro&s;s'd the &s;eas.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Man could tell a merry tale,</L>
<L>And &s;ing a merry &s;ong;</L>
<L>And tho&s;e who heard him &s;ing or talk,</L>
<L>Ne'er thought the ev'ning long.</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>But vain and vicious was the &s;ong,</L>
<L>And wicked was the tale;</L>
<L>And every pau&s;e he always fill'd,</L>
<L>With cider, gin, or ale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Carpenter delighted much,</L>
<L>To hear the Cooper talk;</L>
<L>And with him to the Ale-hou&s;e oft,</L>
<L>Wou'd take his evening walk.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At fir&s;t he did not care for drink,</L>
<L>But only lik'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">un;</L>
<L>But &s;oon he from the Cooper learnt,</L>
<L>The &s;ame &s;ad cour&s;e to run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He &s;aid the Cooper's company,</L>
<L>Was all for which he car'd;</L>
<L>But &s;oon he drank as much as he,</L>
<L>To &s;wear like him &s;oon dar'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His hammer now neglected lay,</L>
<L>For work he little car'd;</L>
<L>Half fini&s;h'd wheels, and broken tools,</L>
<L>Were &s;trew'd about his yard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To get him to attend his work,</L>
<L>No prayers cou'd now prevail:</L>
<L>His hatchet and his plane forgot,</L>
<L>He never drove a Nail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His chearful ev'nings now no more,</L>
<L>With peace and plenty &s;mil'd;</L>
<L>No more he &s;ought his plea&s;ing Wife,</L>
<L>Nor hugg'd his &s;miling child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For not his drunken nights alone,</L>
<L>Were with the Cooper pa&s;t;</L>
<L>His days were at the Angel &s;pent,</L>
<L>And &s;till he &s;tay'd the la&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No hand&s;ome Sunday &s;uit was left,</L>
<L>Nor decent holland &s;hirt;</L>
<L>No no&s;egay mark'd the Sabbath day,</L>
<L>But all was rags and dirt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more his Church he did frequent,</L>
<L>A &s;ymptom ever &s;ad;</L>
<L>Where once the Sunday is mi&s;pent,</L>
<L>The week days mu&s;t be bad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The cottage mortgag'd for its worth,</L>
<L>The favourite orchard &s;old;</L>
<L>He &s;oon began to feel th'effects</L>
<L>Of hunger and of cold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pewter di&s;hes one by one,</L>
<L>Were pawn'd, till none was left;</L>
<L>And wife and babe at home remain'd</L>
<L>Of every help bereft.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By chance he call'd at home one nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>
<L>And in a &s;urly mood,</L>
<L>He bade his weeping wife to get</L>
<L>Immediately &s;ome food.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His empty cupboard well he knew</L>
<L>Mu&s;t needs be bare of bread;</L>
<L>No ra&s;her on the rack he &s;aw,</L>
<L>Whence cou'd he then be fed?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His wife<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rquin's Gardener.</NOTE> a piteous &s;igh did heave,</L>
<L>And then before him laid</L>
<L>A ba&s;ket cover'd with a cloth</L>
<L>But not a word &s;he &s;aid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to her hu&s;band gave a knife</L>
<L>With many a &s;ilent tear;</L>
<L>In ha&s;te he tore the cover off,</L>
<L>And &s;aw his child lay there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"There lies thy babe, the mother &s;aid,</L>
<L>"Oppre&s;s'd with famine &s;ore;</L>
<L>"O kill us both&mdash;'twere kinder far,</L>
<L>We cou'd not &s;uffer more."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Carpenter, &s;truck to the heart,</L>
<L>Fell on his knees &s;traitway;</L>
<L>He wrung his hands&mdash;confe&s;s'd his &s;ins,</L>
<L>And did both weep and pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From that &s;ame hour the Cooper more,</L>
<L>He never wou'd behold;</L>
<L>Nor wou'd he to the Ale-hou&s;e go,</L>
<L>Had it been pav'd with gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Wife forgave him all the pa&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;ooth'd his &s;orrowing mind,</L>
<L>And much he griev'd that e'er he wrong'd</L>
<L>The worthie&s;t of her kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By lab'ring hard, and working late,</L>
<L>By indu&s;try and pains,</L>
<L>His Cottage was at length redeem'd,</L>
<L>And &s;av'd were all his gains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Sundays now at Church were &s;pent,</L>
<L>His home was his delight.</L>
<L>The following ver&s;e him&s;elf he made,</L>
<L>And read it every night:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Drunkard Murders Child and Wife,</L>
<L>Nor matters it a pin,</L>
<L>Whether he &s;tabs them with his knife,</L>
<L>Or &s;tarves them by his gin.</L>
