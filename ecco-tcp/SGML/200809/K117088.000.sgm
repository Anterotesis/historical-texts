<P>Hop Merchant Sir! there's not a finer gentleman about Town than Mr. Bouquet.</P>

<P>Like enough, I never &s;aw him, but my old friend Vinegar the Wine Merchant, tells me, there is not a greater coxcomb about town, than this Mr. Bou|quet. His father was a Frenchman I'm told, he's a fop by inheritance.</P>

<P>Sir, your child's enemy can never be your friend &mdash;Mr. Vinegar, talk of Mr. Bouquet&mdash;Mr. Vinegar is a mechanic, but Mr. Bouquet, is a gentleman and &s;corns to do any thing.</P>
