<HEAD>COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX, AT VENICE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;, pr&egrave;s le Pont Royal.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE, Fairfax, according to pro|mi&s;e, to inform you that I have been a fortnight in France, and four days in this city. The tract of country over which I have pa&s;&s;ed, within the&s;e three months, is con&s;iderable. From Naples
<PB N="2" REF="4">
to Rome; from Rome to Florence; from Florence to Venice, where we &s;pent our carnival; from Venice to Mo|dena, Parma, and Genoa; from thence to Turin; from Turin to Geneva; then, turning to the left, to Lyons; and from Lyons to Paris. Objects have pa&s;&s;ed before me in &s;uch a rapid &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, that the time I have &s;pent abroad, though not more than a year and a half, appears &s;omething like a life. The &s;ight of the proud Alps, which boldly look eternity in the face, imparts a &s;en|&s;ation of length of time wholly inade|quate to the few hours that are employed in pa&s;&s;ing them. The labour up is a kind of age; and the &s;wift de&s;cent is like falling from the clouds, once more to become an inhabitant of earth.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
Here at Paris I half fancy my&s;elf at home. And yet, to timid people who have never beheld the ocean, and who are informed that &s;eas divide France and England, Paris appears to be at an unat|tainable di&s;tance. Every thing is rela|tive in this world; great or &s;mall near or di&s;tant only by compari&s;on. The traveller who &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed the de|&s;erts, and &s;uffered all the perils all the emotions of a journey from Bengal by land, would think him&s;elf much nearer home, at Naples, than I do, coming from Naples, at Paris: and tho&s;e who have &s;ailed round the world &s;eem &s;atis|fied that their labour is within a hair's breadth of being at an end, when they arrive, on their return, at the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
You, Fairfax, have frequently a&s;ked me to give you accounts of this and that place, of the things I have &s;een, and of the ob&s;ervations I have made. But I have more frequently put the &s;ame kind of que&s;tions to my&s;elf, and never yet could return a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. I have &s;een people who&s;e manners are &s;o different from tho&s;e of my own country, that I have &s;eemed to act with them from a kind of conviction of their being of another &s;pecies. Yet a moment's con&s;ideration undeceives me: I find them to be mere men. Men of different habits, indeed; but actuated by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame de&s;ire of &s;elf-grati|fication. Yes, Fairfax, the &s;un moon and &s;tars make their appearance, in Italy, as regularly as in England; nay
<PB N="5" REF="7">
much more &s;o, for there is not a tenth part of the intervening clouds.</P>
<P>When mole&s;ted by their dirt, their vermin, their beggars, their prie&s;ts, and their prejudices, how often have I look|ed at them with contempt! The un|cleanline&s;s that re&s;ults from heat and indolence, the ob&s;equious &s;lavi&s;hne&s;s of the common people, contra&s;ted with their loquacious impertinence, the &s;en|&s;uality of their ho&s;ts of monks, nay the gluttony even of their begging friars, their ignorant adoration of the rags and rotten wood which they them&s;elves dre&s;s up, the protection afforded to the mo&s;t atrocious criminals if they can but e&s;cape to a ma&s;s of &s;tone which they call &s;acred, the little horror in which they hold mur|der, the promptne&s;s with which they a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inate
<PB N="6" REF="8">
for affronts which they want the &s;pirit to re&s;ent, their gro&s;s buffooneries religious and theatrical, the ridiculous tales told to the vulgar by their preachers, and the improbable farces which are the delight of the gentle and the &s;imple, all the&s;e, and many other things of a &s;imilar nature, &s;eem to degrade them below ra|tional creatures.</P>
<P>Yet rever&s;e the picture, and they ap|pear rather to be demi-gods than men! Li&s;ten to their mu&s;ic! Behold their paintings! Examine their palaces, their ba&s;ins of porphyry, urns and va&s;es of Numidian marble, catacombs, and &s;ubter|ranean cities; their &s;culptured heroes, triumphal arches, and amphitheatres in which a nation might a&s;&s;emble; their Co|rinthian columns hewn from he rocks
<PB N="7" REF="9">
of Egypt, and obeli&s;ks of granite tran&s;|ported by &s;ome &s;trange but forgotten means from Alexandria; the &s;implicity the grandeur and beauty of their tem|ples and churches; the va&s;t fruitfulne&s;s of their lands, their rich vineyards, teeming fields, and early harve&s;ts; the mingled &s;ublime and beautiful over the face of nature in this country, which is &s;heltered from invaders by mountains and &s;eas, &s;o as by a &s;mall degree of art to render it impregnable; their de&s;olat|ing earthquakes, which yet &s;eem but to renovate fertility; their volcanos, &s;ending forth volumes of flame and rivers of fire, and overwhelming cities which though they have buried they have not ut|terly de&s;troyed; the&s;e and a thou&s;and other particulars, which I can neither
<PB N="8" REF="10">
enumerate nor remember, apparently &s;peak them a race the mo&s;t favoured of heaven, and announce Italy to be a coun|try for who&s;e embelli&s;hment and renown earth and heaven, men and gods have for ages contended.</P>
<P>The recollection of the&s;e things ap|pears to be more vivid, and to give me greater plea&s;ure than I believe the &s;ight of them afforded. Perhaps it is my temper. Impatient of delay, I had &s;carcely glanced at one object before I was eager to hunt for another. The te|diou&s;ne&s;s of the Ciceroni was to me into|lerable. What cannot in&s;tantly be com|prehended I can &s;carcely per&s;uade my|&s;elf to think worthy of the trouble of enquiry. I love to enjoy; and, if en|joyment do not come to me, I mu&s;t fly
<PB N="9" REF="11">
to &s;eek it, and ha&s;ten from object to object till it be overtaken.</P>
<P>Intellectual plea&s;ures delight me, when they are quick, certain, and ea|&s;ily obtained. I leave tho&s;e which I am told ari&s;e from patient &s;tudy, length of time, and &s;evere application, to the fools who think time given to be &s;o wa&s;ted. Ro&s;es grow for me to gather: rivers roll for me to lave in. Let the &s;lave dig the mine, but for me let the diamond &s;parkle. Let the lamb, the dove, and the life-loving eel writhe and die; it &s;hall not di&s;turb me, while I en|joy the viands. The five &s;en&s;es are my deities; to them I pay wor&s;hip and ado|ration, and never yet have I been &s;lack in the performance of my duty.</P>
<P>What! Shall we exi&s;t but for a few
<PB N="10" REF="12">
years, and of tho&s;e &s;hall there be but a few hours as it were of youth, joy, and plea&s;ure, and &s;hall we let them &s;lip? Shall we ca&s;t away a good that never can return; and &s;eek for pain, which is it&s;elf in &s;o much ha&s;te to &s;eek for us? Away with &s;uch folly! The oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tem be mine.</P>
<P>The voluptuous Italian, as wi&s;e in this as in other arts, knows better. He lives for the moment, and takes care not to let the moment &s;lip. His very beggars, ba&s;king in the &s;un, will not remove, &s;o long as hunger will &s;uffer them to enjoy the happine&s;s of being idle. Who &s;o perfectly under&s;tand the luxury of indo|lence as the Lazaroni of Naples?</P>
<P>The Italian, indeed, &s;eems to exert all the craft for which he is &s;o famous, to
<PB N="11" REF="13">
accompli&s;h this &s;ole purpo&s;e of enjoy|ment. He marries a wife, and the hand&s;ome&s;t he can procure; that, when the ardour of de&s;ire is &s;atiated, &s;he may fleece &s;ome gallant, who &s;hall pay for his plea&s;ures el&s;ewhere. And, as va|riety is the object of all, gallant &s;ucceeds to gallant, while he him&s;elf flies from mi&s;tre&s;s to mi&s;tre&s;s, and thus an equal barter is maintained.</P>
<P>This office of Cici&s;beo is however an intolerably expen&s;ive one; e&s;pecially to our countrymen. The Signora is &s;o in|ventive in her faculties, there are &s;o many trinkets which &s;he dies to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and her wants, real and artificial, are &s;o numerous, that the pur&s;e is never quiet in the pocket. And every Engli&s;hman
<PB N="12" REF="14">
is &s;uppo&s;ed to be furni&s;hed with the pur&s;e of Fortunatus.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t becau&s;e the mo&s;t dangerous part of the bu&s;ine&s;s is, the ugly and the old think them&s;elves entitled to be as amorous as the young and beautiful; and a tall fellow, with a little fre&s;h blood in his veins, is &s;ure to have no peace for them. Prithee, Fairfax, tell me how the Conte&s;&s;a behaved, when &s;he found I had e&s;caped from her amorous pur&s;uit. She began to make me unea&s;y; and I almo&s;t thought it was as nece&s;&s;ary for me to have a ta&s;ter as any tyrant in Chri&s;tendom. Poi&s;on and the &s;tiletto di&s;turbed my dreams; for there were not only &s;he, but two or three more, who &s;eemed determined to take no de|nial.
<PB N="13" REF="15">
I congratulated my&s;elf, as I was rolling down mount Cenis, to think that I was at length actually &s;afe, and that the damned black-looking, hook-no&s;ed, &s;cowling fellow from Bergamo, whom I had &s;o often remarked dogging me, was no longer at my heels.</P>
<P>But I have now bidden adieu to the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini,</HI> the <HI>Carnivali,</HI> and the <HI>Donne;</HI> and &s;oon &s;hall &s;ee what provi&s;ion this land of France affords. For the &s;hort time that I have been here, I have no occa&s;ion to complain of my reception. I do not know why, Fairfax, but we Engli&s;hmen &s;eem to be in tolerably good repute every where, with the ladies. Well, well, pretty dears, they &s;hall find me very much at their &s;ervice. I &s;hould be
<PB N="14" REF="16">
&s;orry to bring di&s;grace upon my nation, Fairfax. Would not you?</P>
<P>I expect to find you a punctual cor|re&s;pondent. Fail not to let me know, when, weary of being a <HI>Cavaliere &s;ervente,</HI> you &s;hall leave the proud banks of the Adriatic, and the wanton Venice, for &s;ome other abode; that our letters may never mi&s;s their aim. I will relate every thing that happens to me, when it can either afford you amu&s;ement to read, or me &s;atisfaction to write. You have too much honour and hone&s;ty not to do the &s;ame. Or, if not, I will try what a threat can do: therefore remember that, unle&s;s you fulfil the terms of our agree|ment, and give me an account of all your rogueries, adventures, &s;ucce&s;&s;es,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
and hair-breadth e&s;capes, I will choo&s;e &s;ome other more punctual and more en|tertaining corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve further, and let that be a &s;pur to your indu&s;try, I have a tale in petto; a whim&s;ical adventure which happened to me ye&s;terday evening; but which I &s;hall forbear to regale you with, for three &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons: fir&s;t becau&s;e it is my good plea&s;ure; &s;econdly becau&s;e I like it; and la&s;tly &s;uch is my &s;overeign will. Nay, if that be all, I can give you three more: fir&s;t becau&s;e I am almo&s;t at the end of my paper; next becau&s;e I may want a good &s;ubject when I write again; and finally becau&s;e the po&s;t is a &s;turdy unceremonious fellow, and does not think proper to wait my lei&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
So farewell; and believe me to be very &s;incerely yours,</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> I have this moment received information that Sir Arthur St. Ives and his daughter arrived ye&s;terday in the afternoon at Paris. I have heard that the daughter is the mo&s;t beautiful wo|man in England, and that her wit is even &s;uperior to her beauty. I am very glad of the accident, for I have a great de|&s;ire to &s;ee her. My mother's la&s;t was partly a letter of bu&s;ine&s;s, but chiefly of recommendation, particularly of the young lady: and in it was enclo&s;ed one from my &s;i&s;ter, Loui&s;a, which gives a very high character of her friend, Anna
<PB N="17" REF="19">
St. Ives. They have become acquainted &s;ince I have been abroad. The letter is loaded with advice to me, at which as you may well think I laugh. The&s;e girls, tied to their mother's apron|&s;trings, pretend to advi&s;e a man who has &s;een the world! But vanity and con|ceit are &s;trange propen&s;ities, that totally blind the eyes of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. I have lived but little at home, but I always thought the young lady a forward im|perious mi&s;s; yet I never before knew her &s;o much on the &s;tilts. I expect &s;he will &s;oon put on boots and buck&s;kin, and hor&s;ewhip her fellows her&s;elf; for &s;he improves apace.</P>
<P>Once more farewell,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel d'E&s;pagne, Rue Guenegaude, Fauxbourg St. Germain.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER abundance of jolting in car|riages, &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, and &s;uch like trifling accidents, incidental to us travellers, here we are at la&s;t, dear Loui&s;a. My very fir&s;t demand has been for pen ink and paper, to inform my kind friend of
<PB N="19" REF="21">
our &s;afe arrival: though I am &s;o giddy, after this po&s;t ha&s;te four day's hurry, that I &s;carcely can write a &s;traight line. Nei|ther do I know whether I have any thing to &s;ay; though I &s;eemed to my&s;elf to have acquired an additional &s;tock of ideas, at the very moment that I fir&s;t beheld Calais and the coa&s;t of France.</P>
<P>What is there, my dear, in the human mind, that induces us to think every thing which is unu&s;ual is little le&s;s than ab&s;urd? Is it prejudice, is it vanity, or is it a &s;hort and imperfect view; a want of di&s;crimination? I could have laughed, but that I had &s;ome latent &s;en&s;e of my own folly, at the &s;ight of a dozen French men and women, and two or three loi|tering monks, whom curio&s;ity had drawn

together upon the pier-head, to &s;ee us come into port. And what was my in|citement to laughter?&mdash;It was the dif|ferent cut of a coat. It was a &s;ilk bag, in which the hair was tied, an old &s;word, and a dangling pair of ruffles; which none of them &s;uited with the poverty of the dre&s;s, and meagre appearance, of a per&s;on who &s;eemed to &s;trut and value him&s;elf upon &s;uch marks of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Sterne was in my pocket, and his gen|tle &s;pirit was pre&s;ent to my mind. Per|haps the per&s;on who thus excited a tran|&s;ient emotion of ri&s;ibility was a noble|man. For the extremes of riches and of poverty are, as I have been informed, very frequent among the nobility of France. He might happen to think
<PB N="21" REF="27">
him&s;elf a man highly unfortunate and aggrieved. The &s;uppo&s;ition occa&s;ioned my &s;mile to evaporate in a &s;igh.</P>
<P>But the hou&s;es!&mdash;They were diffe|rently built!&mdash;Could that be right? They were not &s;o clean! That was certainly wrong. In what &s;trange land is the &s;tandard of propriety erected?&mdash;Then the blue and brown jackets of the women; their undaunted manner of &s;taring; their want of hats, and &s;tays; the &s;lovenly look of &s;lippers not drawn up at the heel; the clum&s;y wooden &s;hoes of &s;ome, and the bare feet of others; nay their readine&s;s to laugh at the un|couth appearance of the people who were condemning them for being ridicu|lous; what could all this be? But how came I &s;o unaccountably to forget that
<PB N="22" REF="28">
children and beggars &s;ometimes go bare|foot in England; and that few people, perhaps, are more addicted to &s;tare and laugh at &s;trangers than our&s;elves? Oh! But the French are &s;o polite a nation that even the common people are all well bred; and would enter a drawing-room with more ea&s;e and grace than an Engli&s;h gentleman!&mdash;Have you never heard this non&s;en&s;e, Loui&s;a?</P>
<P>The character of nations, or rather of mind, is apparent in trifles. Granted. Let us turn our eyes back to the &s;hores we have &s;o lately left: let us examine the trifles we hang about our&s;elves. How many of them, which characterize and as it were &s;tamp the nation with ab&s;urdity, e&s;cape unob&s;erved! We &s;ee them every day; we have adopted and
<PB N="23" REF="29">
made them our own, and we &s;hould be &s;trangely offended, &s;hould any per&s;on take the liberty, having di&s;covered the folly of them, to laugh at us.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>I wrote thus far la&s;t night; but learn|ing, on enquiry, that Tue&s;days and Fri|days are foreign po&s;t days, I left off; being rather indi&s;po&s;ed after my journey. 'Tis only a &s;wimming in the head, which will &s;oon leave me; though I find it has returned upon me occa&s;ionally all the morning. But to my plea&s;ing ta&s;k; again let me prattle to my friend.</P>
<P>The innkeepers of Calais come them|&s;elves, or &s;end their waiters, to watch for and invite pa&s;&s;engers to their hou&s;es; and will not be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without diffi|culty.
<PB N="24" REF="30">
The mo&s;t daring endeavour to &s;ecure cu&s;tomers, by &s;eizing on &s;ome of their trunks, or baggage. But we had determined to go to De&s;&s;ein's, and the active Frank &s;oon made way for us.</P>
<P>I was amu&s;ed with the handbill, &s;tuck up again&s;t the walls of this inn, or hotel, as it is called; announcing it to be the large&s;t, the complete&s;t, the mo&s;t magnifi|cent, with a thou&s;and et caeteras, in the univer&s;e; and recounting not only its numerous accommodations, but the mul|tifarious trades which it contained within its own walls; to all which was added a playhou&s;e. A playhou&s;e it is true there was, but no players; and as for trades, there were at lea&s;t as many as we wanted. Sir Arthur took over his own carriage; otherwi&s;e this fir&s;t of inns in
<PB N="25" REF="31">
the univer&s;e would not have furni&s;hed him with one, but on condition of its being purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur ob&s;erved it was &s;trange that the French innkeepers &s;hould not yet have di&s;covered it to be their intere&s;t to keep carriages for travellers, as in England. To which Frank Henley &s;hrewdly an|&s;wered, that the book of po&s;t roads, in his hand, informed him government was in reality every where the innkeeper; and re&s;erved to it&s;elf the profits of po&s;t|ing. And the deepe&s;t thinkers, added Frank, inform us that every thing in which governments interfere is &s;poiled. I remarked to him that this principle would lead us a great way. Yes, &s;aid he, but not too far: and, playing upon my words, added, it would lead us back to
<PB N="26" REF="32">
the right way, from which we appear at pre&s;ent to have &s;trayed, into the very la|byrinth of folly and blunders.</P>
<P>Frank is earne&s;tly &s;tudious of the ef|fects of governments, and laws; and reads the authors who have written be&s;t on &s;uch &s;ubjects with great attention, and plea&s;ure. He and Sir Arthur by no means agree, in politics; and Sir Arthur has two or three times been half affronted, that a man &s;o young and &s;o inferior to him&s;elf, as he &s;uppo&s;es Frank to be, &s;hould venture to be of a different opinion, and di&s;pute with him; who was once in his life too a member of parlia|ment. I am obliged now and then &s;lily to remind him of the highwayman and Turnham Green.</P>
<P>And now, Loui&s;a, traveller like, could
<PB N="27" REF="33">
I regale you with a melancholy narrative, relating how the fields in this country have no hedges; how the cows are as meagre as their keepers; how wretched the huts and their owners appear; how French po&s;tillions jump in and out of jack-boots, with their &s;hoes on, becau&s;e they are too heavy to drag after them; how they harne&s;s their hor&s;es with ropes; how dexterou&s;ly they crack the mercile&s;s whips with which they belabour the poor hacks they drive; how we were obliged to pay for five of the&s;e hacks, having only four in our carriage, and two of them frequently blind, lame, or u&s;ele&s;s; with many other items, that might be grievous to hear, could I but per&s;uade my&s;elf thoroughly to pity or be angry at the whole French
<PB N="28" REF="34">
nation, for not exactly re&s;embling the Engli&s;h. But do they them&s;elves com|plain? Mercy on us! Complain?&mdash;Nothing is &s;o grateful to their hearts, as the prai&s;e of that dear country, which Engli&s;h travellers are &s;o prone to de&s;pi&s;e!</P>
<P>Frank as u&s;ual has been all attention, all ardour, all anxiety, to render our journey as plea&s;ant as po&s;&s;ible. His efforts have been chiefly directed to me; my ea&s;e, my &s;atisfaction, my enjoyment, have been his continual care. Not that he has neglected or overlooked Sir Ar|thur. He overlooks no living creature, to whom he can give aid. He lo&s;es no opportunity of gaining the e&s;teem and affection of high and low, rich and poor. His delicacy never &s;lumbers.
<PB N="29" REF="35">
His thir&s;t of doing good is never a&s;|&s;uaged. I am young it is true, but I never before met a youth &s;o de&s;erving. Think of him my&s;elf I mu&s;t not; though I would give kingdoms, if I had them, to &s;ee him completely happy.</P>
<P>And now, dear Loui&s;a, I am &s;oon to meet your brother. Why do I &s;eem to recollect this with a kind of agitation? Is there rebellion in my heart? Would it &s;werve from the &s;evere dictates of duty? No. I will &s;et too &s;trict a watch over its emotions. What! Does not Loui&s;a honour me with the title of friend, and &s;hall I prove unworthy of her friend&s;hip? Forbid it emulation, truth, and virtue!</P>
<P>How happy &s;hould I be were your brother and Frank Henley to conceive

an immediate partiality for each other! How much too would it promote the project I wi&s;h to execute! I have been taxing my invention to &s;orm &s;ome little plot for this purpo&s;e, but I find it barren. I can do nothing but determine to &s;peak of Frank as he de&s;erves; which &s;urely will gain him the love of the whole world. And for his part, I know how ready he will be to give merit its due.</P>
<P>I have more than once purpo&s;ely men|tioned your brother's name to Sir Ar|thur, when Frank was pre&s;ent; in &s;ome manner to prepare and guard him again&s;t &s;urpri&s;e. But I could not but remark my hints had an effect upon him that betrayed how much his heart was alarmed. He thinks too favourably, and I fear too frequently of me. What can be
<PB N="31" REF="37">
done? The wi&s;e&s;t of us are the &s;laves of circum&s;tances, and of the prejudices of others. How many excellent quali|ties are met in him! And for the&s;e to be rejected&mdash;! Alas!&mdash;We mu&s;t patiently &s;ubmit to the awful laws of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Neither is Sir Arthur without his fears and &s;u&s;picions. His di&s;cour&s;e be|trays his alarms. He cannot conceive that a love of the merits of Frank can be di&s;tinct from all love of his per&s;on. The crime of di&s;obedience in children, the ruin of families by fooli&s;h and unequal marriages, and the wretchedne&s;s which is the re&s;ult of &s;uch guilty conduct, have been hinted at more than once lately; and though not with many words, yet with a degree of anxiety that gave me
<PB N="32" REF="38">
pain, for it taught me, being &s;u&s;pected, half to &s;u&s;pect my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t conclude: my travelling vertigo I find is not immediately to be &s;haken off. I imagine that a few hours calm &s;leep will be my be&s;t phy&s;ician. Adieu. I &s;hall wait, with &s;ome impa|tience, for a letter from my dear Loui&s;a.</P>

<HEAD>FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, H&ocirc;tel d'E&s;pagne, Rue Guenegaude, Fauxbourg St. Germain.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY emotions, Oliver, are too &s;trong to permit me to narrate common occur|rences. I can only tell thee our journey is ended, that we arrived ye&s;terday, and that we are now at Paris. My feelings are more tumultuous than they ought to
<PB N="34" REF="40">
be, and &s;eek relief in the mild and li&s;|tening patience of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t however I mu&s;t relate a &s;ingular adventure, which happened ye&s;terday evening.</P>
<P>After I had &s;een our baggage pro|perly di&s;po&s;ed of, curio&s;ity led me, though night was approaching, to walk out and take a view of the famous fa&ccedil;ade of the Louvre. From thence I &s;trayed, through the gardens of the Thuilleries, to the Place de Louis XV; being de|lighted with the beauties around me, but which I have not now time to de&s;cribe. A little farther are the Champs Ely&s;&eacute;es, where trees planted in quincunx afford a tolerably agreeable retreat to the Pari|&s;ians.</P>
<P>It was now twilight. The idlers had
<PB N="35" REF="41">
retired; for I &s;uppo&s;e, from what fol|lowed, that it is not very &s;afe to walk after dark, in the&s;e environs. Ignorant of this, and not apprehen&s;ive of any danger, I had &s;trayed to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance among the trees, again&s;t one of which I &s;tood leaning, and contemplating the banks of the Seine, the Palais Bourbon, and other &s;urrounding objects. All was &s;ilent, except the di&s;tant hum of the city, and the rattling of carriages, which could but ju&s;t be heard.</P>
<P>Amid this calm, I was &s;uddenly alarmed by voices in anger, and ap|proaching. They &s;poke in French, and pre&s;ently became more di&s;tinct and loud.</P>
<P>Draw, &s;ir, &s;aid one.</P>
<P><HI>Mort de ma vie,</HI> come along, an&s;wered the other.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="42">
Draw, &s;ir, I &s;ay; replied the fir&s;t. I neither know who you are nor what your intentions may be. I will go no further. Draw!</P>
<P><HI>Sacri&s;ti,</HI> an&s;wered his antagoni&s;t, we &s;hall be interrupted: the guard will be upon us in a moment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t however was re&s;olute, and in an imperious voice again bade him draw. Their &s;words were in&s;tantly out, and they began to a&s;&s;ault each other. Thou may&s;t imagine, Oliver, I would not cowardly &s;tand and be a &s;pectator of murder. They were not twenty paces from me. I flew; when, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, one of them called, in Engli&s;h, Keep off, &s;ir! Who are you? Keep off! And, his enemy having dropt his guard, he pre&s;ented his point to me.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="43">
It was no time to he&s;itate. I ru&s;hed re&s;olutely between them; holding up my open hands above my head, to &s;hew the Engli&s;hman, who &s;eemed apprehen|&s;ive of a con&s;piracy, he had nothing to fear from me. His anger almo&s;t over|came him: he held up his &s;word, as if to &s;trike with it, and with great haughti|ne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion again bade me begone. Have patience, &s;ir, an&s;wered I. Men &s;hall not a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate each other, if I can prevent it.</P>
<P>Let us retire, &s;aid the Frenchman: I knew we &s;hould be interrupted.</P>
<P>You &s;hall not fight. I will follow you, added I, will call for help.</P>
<P>You are a damned impertinent fel|low, &s;aid the Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="44">
Be it &s;o; but you &s;hall not fight, was my an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The combatants, finding me &s;o deter|mined, put up their &s;words, and mu|tually exchanged their addre&s;s; after which they &s;eparated. So that it is pro|bable, Oliver, my interference has done no good. But that I mu&s;t leave to chance. I could not act otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>This incident, &s;o immediately after my arrival, in a place &s;o &s;trange to me, and coming &s;o &s;uddenly, made too great an impre&s;&s;ion upon me not to tell it thee. Though I have another topic much nearer my heart; the true &s;tate of which has been &s;hewn me, by an event of which I will now inform thee.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="45">
We are lodged here in the fir&s;t floor, con&s;i&s;ting of many chambers, each of which is a thoroughfare to the mo&s;t di&s;tant. It is not ten minutes &s;ince I was &s;eated, and preparing to write to thee, when Anna came to pa&s;s through the room where I was, and retire to her own apartment. She was fatigued, I imagine, by the journey; though I frequently fear the ardour of her mind will injure her con&s;ti|tution. She walked with &s;ome difficulty, was evidently giddy, and &s;taggered. I was alarmed, and was ri&s;ing, when &s;he called to me faintly,&mdash;"Help me, Frank!"</P>
<P>I &s;prung and caught her as &s;he was falling. I received her in my arms! And my agitation was &s;o violent, that it was with difficulty I could pre&s;erve
<PB N="40" REF="46">
&s;trength enough to &s;upport her, and &s;eat her in the chair I had quitted.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e to me was a kind of wil|derne&s;s. I knew not where to run, yet run I did for water. I called Laura, with a latent wi&s;h that nobody might help her but my&s;elf; and, as it hap|pened, nobody heard. I returned; &s;he recovered, thanked me, with her u&s;ual heavenly kindne&s;s, and I conducted her to her apartment, &s;he leaning on my arm.</P>
<P>Oh! Oliver, is it wrong to feel what I feel, at the remembrance? If it be, reprove me &s;ternly; teach me my duty, and I will thank thee. Surely there is &s;omething &s;upernatural hovers over her! At lea&s;t &s;he re&s;embles no other mortal! Then her kindne&s;s to me, her looks, her
<PB N="41" REF="47">
&s;miles, her actions, are all intentional benignancy. She is now but three chambers di&s;tant from me; enjoying as I hope refre&s;hing &s;lumbers. Angels guard her, and in&s;pire her dreams. No matter for the non&s;en&s;e of my words, Oliver; thou knowe&s;t my meaning. She de&s;ired me to bid Laura not di&s;turb her; and here I &s;it, watchful of my precious charge. Grateful, heart-&s;ooth|ing office!</P>
<P>And now, Oliver, what am I to think? My fears would tie my tongue; but, ei|ther I am deluded or hope brightens upon me, and I want the &s;elf-denying re&s;olution of &s;ilence. Yes, Oliver, I mu&s;t repeat, there is &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s in her countenance, when &s;he &s;peaks to me, &s;uch a &s;mile, &s;o inviting, &s;o affirmative,
<PB N="42" REF="48">
that I am ince&s;&s;antly flattering my&s;elf it cannot but have a meaning. I have &s;everal times lately heard her &s;igh; and once &s;o emphatically that I think it im|po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be deceived. I and Sir Arthur were conver&s;ing. I was en|deavouring to &s;hew the pernicious ten|dency of the prejudices of mankind, and inadvertently touched upon the ab|&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing there could be any &s;uperiority, of man over man, except that which genius and virtue gave. Sir Arthur did not approve the doctrine, and was petti&s;h. I perhaps was warmed, by a latent &s;en&s;e of my own &s;ituation, and exclaimed&mdash;<Q>Oh! How many no|ble hearts are groaning, at this in&s;tant, under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e preju|dices! Hearts that groan, not becau&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="49">
they &s;uffer, but becau&s;e they are denied the power effectually to aid their very oppre&s;&s;ors, who exert the de&s;poti&s;m of numbers, to enforce claims which they them&s;elves feel to be unju&s;t, but which they think it di&s;honourable to relinqui&s;h!</Q>&mdash;It was then the &s;igh bur&s;t forth of which I told thee. I turned and found her eyes fixed upon me. She blu&s;hed and look|ed down, and then again bent them toward me. I was heated and daring. We exchanged looks, and &s;aid&mdash;! Vo|lumes could not repeat how much!&mdash;But &s;urely neither of us &s;aid any thing to the other's di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Oh! The bli&s;s to perceive my&s;elf un|der&s;tood and not reproved! To meet &s;uch emanations of mind&mdash;! Ec&s;ta&s;y is
<PB N="44" REF="50">
a poor word! Once more &s;he &s;eemed to repeat<HI>&mdash;She would love me if I would let her.</HI></P>
<P>Tell me, then&mdash;Have I not rea&s;on on my &s;ide? And, if I have, will &s;he not li&s;ten? May &s;he not be won? Shall I doubt of victory, fighting under the banners of truth? Alas!&mdash;Well well&mdash;</P>
<P>My own &s;en&s;ations, Oliver, are &s;o acute, and I am &s;o fearful le&s;t they &s;hould lead me a&s;tray, that I could not forbear this detail&mdash;Let us change the theme.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>Well, here we are, in France; and, wonderful to tell, France is not En|gland!</P>
<P>I imagine it is impo&s;&s;ible to travel
<PB N="45" REF="51">
through a foreign country, without fall|ing into certain reveries; and that each man will fa&s;hion his dreams in part from accident, and in part according to the manner in which he has been accu&s;|tomed to ruminate. Thy mo&s;t excellent father, Oliver, early turned my mind to the con&s;ideration of forms of govern|ment, and their effects upon the man|ners and morals of men. The &s;ubject, in his e&s;timation, is the mo&s;t noble that comes under our cognizance; and the more I think my&s;elf capable of examin|ing, and the more I actually do examine, the more I am a convert to his opinion. How often has it been &s;aid of France, by various Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers, and by many of its own &s;ages, What a happy country would this be, were it well go|verned!
<PB N="46" REF="52">
But, with equal truth, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of every country under hea|ven; England it&s;elf, Oliver, in &s;pite of our partialities, not excepted.</P>
<P>How fal&s;e, how futile, how ab&s;urd is the remark that a de&s;potic government, under a perfect monarch, would be the &s;tate of highe&s;t felicity! Fir&s;t an impo&s;&s;i|ble thing is a&s;ked; and next impo&s;&s;ible con&s;equences deduced. One tyrant ge|nerates a nation of tyrants. His own mi&s;takes communicate them&s;elves ea&s;t, we&s;t, north, and &s;outh; and what ap|peared to be but a &s;park becomes a con|flagration.</P>
<P>How incon&s;i&s;tent are the demands and complaints of ignorance! It wi&s;hes to tyrannize, yet exclaims again&s;t tyranny! It gra&s;ps at wealth, and pants after
<PB N="47" REF="53">
power; yet clamours aloud, again&s;t the powerful and the wealthy! It hourly &s;tarts out into all the in&s;olence of pride; yet hates and endeavours to &s;purn at the proud!</P>
<P>Among the many who have a vague kind of &s;u&s;picion that things might be better, are mingled a few, who &s;eem very de&s;irous they &s;hould remain as they are. The&s;e are the rich; who, having by ex|tortion and rapine plundered the de|fencele&s;s, and heaped up choice of viands and the fat of the land, &s;ome &s;ufficient to feed ten, &s;ome twenty, &s;ome a hun|dred, &s;ome a thou&s;and, and others whole armies, and being them&s;elves each only able to eat for one, &s;ay to the hungry, who have no food&mdash;<Q>Come! Dance for my &s;port, and I will give you
<PB N="48" REF="54">
bread. Lick the du&s;t off my &s;hoes, and you &s;hall be indulged with a mor|&s;el of meat. Flatter me, and you &s;hall wear my livery. Labour for me, and I will return you a tenth of your gain. Shed your blood in my behalf, and, while you are young and robu&s;t, I will allow you ju&s;t as much as will keep life and &s;oul together; when you are old, and worn out, you may rob, hang, rot, or &s;tarve.</Q></P>
<P>Would not any one imagine, Oliver, that this were poetry? Alas! It is mere, literal, matter of fact.</P>
<P>Yet let us not complain. Men begin to rea&s;on, and to think aloud; and the&s;e things cannot always endure.</P>
<P>I intended to have made &s;ome ob&s;er|vations on the people, the a&s;pect of the
<PB N="49" REF="55">
country, and other trifles; I &s;carcely now know what: but I have wandered into a &s;ubject &s;o va&s;t, &s;o intere&s;ting, &s;o &s;ublime, that all petty individual re|marks &s;ink before it. Nor will I for the pre&s;ent blur the maje&s;ty of the pic|ture, by ill-placed, mean, and di&s;cor|dant objects. Therefore, farewell.</P>

<P>THE odde&s;t and mo&s;t unlucky ac|cident imaginable, Loui&s;a, has happened. Your brother and Frank have unfortu|nately half quarrelled, without knowing each other. I mentioned a giddine&s;s with which I was &s;eized; the con&s;e|quence,
<PB N="53" REF="59">
as I &s;uppo&s;e, of travelling. I was obliged to retire to my chamber; nay &s;hould have fallen as I went, but for Frank. I de&s;ired he would tell Laura not to di&s;turb me; and he it &s;eems planted him&s;elf &s;entinel, with a determi|nation that neither Laura nor any other per&s;on &s;hould approach. I am too often in his thoughts: he is wrong to be&s;tow &s;o much of his time and attention on me. Sir Arthur was gone to look about him; having fir&s;t &s;ent a note, unknown to me, to inform your brother of our ar|rival; and reque&s;ting to &s;ee him, as &s;oon as convenient.</P>
<P>Away hurried your brother, at this mal apropos interval, with Sir Arthur's note in his pocket, to our hotel. He enquired for my father?</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="60">
He was gone out.</P>
<P>For me?</P>
<P>Laura an&s;wered &s;he would call me.</P>
<P>She was running with great ha&s;te, for this purpo&s;e, but was intercepted by Frank; who, agreeably to my de&s;ire, would not &s;uffer her to proceed. She returned; and your brother, referring again to Sir Arthur's note, was much &s;urpri&s;ed, and rather vexed.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked by who&s;e order &s;he was &s;ent back.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered by the order of Mr. Frank.</P>
<P>Who was Mr. Frank?</P>
<P>A young gentleman; [Laura has re|peated all that pa&s;&s;ed] the &s;on of Mr. Aby Henley.</P>
<P>And who was Mr. Aby Henley?</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="61">
The &s;teward and gardener of Sir Ar|thur; his head man.</P>
<P>Steward and gardener? The &s;on of a gardener a gentleman?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir. To be &s;ure, &s;ir, among thorough bred quality, though perhaps he may be better than the be&s;t of them, he is thought no better than a kind of a &s;ort of a gentleman; being not &s;o high born.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid your brother, &s;hew me to this &s;on of Mr. Aby; this peremptory gentleman; or, as you call him, kind of a &s;ort of a gentleman!</P>
<P>Laura obeyed; and &s;he &s;ays they were quite &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of each other; but that I &s;uppo&s;e to be one of the flouri&s;hes of her fancy. Your bro|ther, however, as I under&s;tand, de&s;ired,
<PB N="56" REF="62">
with &s;ome haughtine&s;s, that Frank would &s;uffer the maid to pa&s;s, and inform me he was come, agreeably to Sir Arthur's reque&s;t, to pay his re&s;pects to me. Frank re&s;olutely refu&s;ed; alleging I was not well. Not well! Said your brother. Is not this Sir Arthur's hand|writing? Yes, replied Frank; but I a&s;|&s;ure you &s;he is not well: and I am afraid that even our &s;peaking may awaken her, if &s;he &s;hould chance to be a&s;leep. I mu&s;t therefore reque&s;t, &s;ir, you would retire.</P>
<P>The oddne&s;s of the circum&s;tances, and the po&s;itivene&s;s of Frank, di&s;plea&s;ed your brother. Sir Arthur happened to re|turn; and he went to him, &s;carcely tak|ing time for fir&s;t compliments, but a&s;k|ing whether it were true that I was not well. Sir Arthur was &s;urpri&s;ed: he
<PB N="57" REF="63">
knew nothing of it! I had not thought a giddine&s;s in the head worth a complaint. Laura was again &s;ent to tell me; and was again denied admit|tance. Sir Arthur then, with your bro|ther, came to que&s;tion Frank; who continued firm in his refu&s;al; and when Sir Arthur and your brother had heard that I was &s;o dizzy as to be in danger of falling, had not he &s;upported me, they were &s;atisfied. But &s;uch a meeting, be|tween Frank and your brother, was quite vexatious: when the very rever&s;e too was wi&s;hed! However he is to vi&s;it us this morning; and I will then en|deavour to do ju&s;tice to the worth of Frank, and remove fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which I have &s;ome rea&s;on to fear have been made.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64">
I will pau&s;e here; but, if I find an opportunity, will write another &s;hort let|ter, under the &s;ame cover, by this po&s;t: that is, &s;hould I happen to have any thing more to &s;ay&mdash;This accident was exceedingly unlucky, and I &s;eem as if I felt my&s;elf to blame; e&s;pecially as I am quite in &s;pirits this morning, and re|lieved from my giddy &s;en&s;ations.

<P>IT was well I did not tell my tale in my la&s;t, Fairfax; it would have been &s;poiled. I knew it only by halves. It has ended in the mo&s;t &s;ingular combina|tion of circum&s;tances one could well imagine.</P>
<P>You remember I told you of the ar|rival

of Sir Arthur St. Ives, and his daughter; I believe it was in the po&s;t|&s;cript; and that I was immediately go|ing to&mdash;P&s;haw! I am beginning my &s;tory now at the wrong end. It is throughout exceedingly whim&s;ical. Li&s;ten, and let amazement prop your open mouth.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the ea&s;e with which Frenchmen, though perfect &s;tran|gers to each other, fall into familiar conver&s;ation; and become as intimate in a quarter of an hour, as if they had been acquainted their whole lives.

<P>We talked &s;ome time, and though he made no deep remarks, he was very communicative of anecdotes, which had come within his own knowledge, that painted the manners of the nation. Among other things, he told me it was not uncommon for valets to dre&s;s them|&s;elves in their ma&s;ters clothes, when they &s;uppo&s;ed them to be at a di&s;tance,
<PB N="63" REF="69">
or otherwi&s;e engaged, a&s;&s;ume their ti|tles, and pa&s;s them&s;elves upon the <HI>Bour|geoi&s;ie</HI> and foreigners for counts, dukes, or princes. It was but this day fort|night, &s;aid he, that the Marechal de R&mdash;&s;urpri&s;ed one of his &s;ervants in a &s;imilar di&s;gui&s;e, and with &s;ome jocu|larity publicly ordered the fellow to walk at his heels, then went to his car|riage, and commanded him, full dre&s;&s;ed as he was, to get up behind.</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely ended this account before another per&s;on came up, and with an air of &s;ome authority a&s;ked him where his ma&s;ter was, what he did there, and other que&s;tions.</P>
<P>To all this my quidam acquaintance, with a degree of &s;urpri&s;e that &s;eemed to be tempered with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and
<PB N="64" REF="70">
unaffected urbanity, replied, without be|ing in the lea&s;t di&s;concerted, &s;ir, you mi&s;take me: but I am &s;ure you are too much of a gentleman to mean any wil|ful affront.</P>
<P>Affront! Why whom do you pretend your&s;elf to be, &s;ir?</P>
<P>Sir, I am the Marquis de Pa&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>You the Marquis de Pa&s;&s;y?&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir; I!&mdash;</P>
<P>In&s;olent &s;coundrel!&mdash;</P>
<P>No gentleman, &s;ir, can &s;uffer &s;uch language; and I in&s;i&s;t upon &s;atisfac|tion.&mdash;And accordingly my champion drew his &s;word. His antagoni&s;t, look|ing on him with ineffable contempt, an|&s;wered he would take &s;ome proper op|portunity to cane him as he de&s;erved.</P>
<P>I own I was amazed. I rea&s;oned a
<PB N="65" REF="71">
&s;hort time with my&s;elf, and concluded the per&s;on was mi&s;taken; for that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any man to counter|feit &s;o much ea&s;e, or behave with &s;o much propriety, who was not a gentle|man. I therefore thought proper to interfere, and told the intruder that, having given an in&s;ult, he ought not to be afraid of giving &s;atisfaction&mdash;</P>
<P>And pray, &s;ir, &s;aid he, who are you?</P>
<P>A gentleman, &s;ir, an&s;wered I&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes. As good a one as your com|panion, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>You know, Fairfax, it is not cu&s;tomary with me to &s;uffer in&s;olence to triumph uncha&s;ti&s;ed, and I ordered him imme+diately to draw.</P>
<P>What, &s;ir, in this place, &s;aid he?
<PB N="66" REF="72">
Follow me, if you have any valour to &s;pare.</P>
<P>His &s;pirit plea&s;ed me, and I followed. I know not what became of the fellow, who&s;e cau&s;e I had e&s;pou&s;ed; for I &s;aw him no more.</P>
<P>My antagoni&s;t led me acro&s;s the rue St. Honor&eacute;, to a place which I &s;uppo&s;e you know, called the Ely&s;ian Fields. It began to be late, and I am told there is danger in pa&s;&s;ing the precincts of the guard. I apprehended a con&s;piracy, and at la&s;t refu&s;ed to proceed any far|ther. Finding me ob&s;tinate he drew, but &s;aid we &s;hould be interrupted.</P>
<P>He was no fal&s;e prophet; for we had not made half a dozen pa&s;&s;es before a youth, whom from his boots and appear|ance
<PB N="67" REF="73">
I &s;uppo&s;ed to be Engli&s;h, came running and vociferating&mdash;Forbear! I was not quite certain that his appearance might not be artifice; I therefore acco&s;t|ed him in Engli&s;h, in which language he very readily replied. He was quite a &s;tur|dy, dauntle&s;s gentleman; for, though our &s;words were drawn, and both of us &s;uffi|ciently angry, he re&s;olutely placed him|&s;elf between us, declaring we &s;hould not fight; and that, if we went farther, he would follow.</P>
<P>Nothing was to be done; and I now began to &s;u&s;pect the per&s;on, with whom I had this ridiculous quarrel, to be really a gentleman. I gave him my addre&s;s, and he readily returned his; after which we parted, he &s;inging a French &s;ong, and I cur&s;ing the in&s;olence of the En|gli&s;h
<PB N="68" REF="74">
youth, who &s;eemed to di&s;regard my anger, and to be happy that he had prevented the &s;pilling of blood.</P>
<P>Remember that all this happened on the preceding evening, after I had written the greate&s;t part of my la&s;t long letter. The next morning I fini&s;hed it, and received a note from Sir Arthur St. Ives, as I mentioned.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I could get dre&s;&s;ed, I ha&s;t|ened away; and, arriving at the hotel, enquired for the knight?</P>
<P>He was gone out.</P>
<P>For his daughter?&mdash;</P>
<P>She had retired to her apartment.</P>
<P>I &s;ent in my name. The maid went, and returned with an an&s;wer that Mr. Frank did not think it proper for her mi&s;tre&s;s to be di&s;turbed. Now, Fair|fax,
<PB N="69" REF="75">
gue&s;s who Mr. Frank was if. you can! By heaven, it was the very indivi|dual youth who, the night before, had been &s;o ab&s;olute in putting an end to our duel!</P>
<P>I was planet-&s;truck! Nor was his &s;urpri&s;e le&s;s, when he &s;aw me, and heard my errand and my name.</P>
<P>I found my gentleman as po&s;itive in the morning as in the evening. He was the dragon; touch the fruit who dared! Ja&s;on him&s;elf could not have entrance there! And he was no le&s;s cool than determined. I was almo&s;t tempted to to&s;s him out of the window.</P>
<P>However I am glad I contained my|&s;elf; for, on the entrance of Sir Arthur, we came to an explanation; and I find
<PB N="70" REF="76">
the young lady was really indi&s;po&s;ed. But, con&s;idering his mongrel birth and breeding, for he is the &s;on of a gardener, I really never &s;aw a fellow give him&s;elf &s;uch high airs.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur received me with great ci|vility. I have not yet &s;een the daugh|ter, but I expect to find her a beauty. She is the toa&s;t of the county where her father re&s;ides. I am to be with her in half an hour; and, as I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall be fully engaged with this and other af|fairs for &s;ome days, I &s;hall &s;eal up my letter: you mu&s;t therefore wait for an account of her, till inclination and the full tide of events &s;hall induce me again to indite of great matters.</P>

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel d'E&s;pagne, Rue Guenegaude, Fauxbourg St. Germain.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN eagerly to my Loui&s;a. Mr. Clifton, my dear, has this in&s;tant left us. I give you joy! Yes, he is the brother of my friend! I do not &s;ay he is her equal, though I am not quite &s;ure that he is her inferior. He is all ani|mation,
<PB N="73" REF="79">
all life. His per&s;on is graceful, his manners plea&s;ing, and his mind vi|gorous. I can &s;ay but little from &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance; except that I am convinced his virtues, or his errors, if he have any, [And who is without?] are not of the feeble kind. They are not characteri&s;ed by dull mediocrity; which, of all qualities, is the mo&s;t hopele&s;s, and incapable. He gave his earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee me, when he was refu&s;ed by Frank, the air of a hand&s;ome compli|ment; politely accu&s;ing him&s;elf of im|proper impatience, when he was in ex|pectation of what he was plea&s;ed to call an uncommon plea&s;ure. Though it was our fir&s;t interview, he felt no re&s;traint; but &s;aid many very civil things natu|rally,
<PB N="74" REF="80">
and with an exceedingly good grace.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;ely turned the conver&s;ation on Frank, related &s;ome anecdotes of him, and be&s;towed prai&s;e which was confirmed by Sir Arthur. Your brother, who&s;e imagination is warm and active, called him a tru&s;ty Cerberus; and &s;aid he had a mouth to an&s;wer each of the three; meaning Laura, him&s;elf, and Sir Arthur. Various remarks which e&s;caped him &s;hew that he has a fondne&s;s for plea&s;ant &s;atire, and &s;imiles of humour.</P>
<P>He prai&s;ed Frank, after hearing our account of him; but his prai&s;e was qua|lified with the word ob&s;tinacy. There was an appearance of feeling that the gentleman ought not to have been &s;o
<PB N="75" REF="81">
&s;ternly repul&s;ed, by the &s;on of a &s;tew|ard.&mdash;And was this his kindred equality to my friend?&mdash;Forgive me, Loui&s;a&mdash;It was unju&s;t in me to &s;ay I was not quite &s;ure he is your inferior&mdash;However I can very &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ure you, he is not one of your every day folks.</P>
<P>Frank came in, and your brother ad|dre&s;&s;ed him with good humour, but in a tone denoting it was the gentleman to the &s;ort of a gentleman. I own it plea&s;ed me to ob&s;erve the ea&s;e with which Frank, by his an&s;wers, obliged Mr. Clifton to change his key. But I &s;oon had occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve that the warmth of your brother's expre&s;&s;ions, his eagerne&s;s to be immediately intimate with us, and the advances which he with &s;o little &s;en&s;e of embarra&s;&s;ment made to me, had an ef|fect
<PB N="76" REF="82">
upon Frank which, I greatly fear, was painful. I mu&s;t look to this; it is a &s;erious moment, and I mu&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly ex|amine, and quickly re&s;olve. In the mean time, your brother has kindly in&s;i&s;ted upon devoting him&s;elf wholly to our amu&s;ements; to attend on us, and &s;hew us the public buildings, gardens, paint|ings, and theatres; as well as to intro|duce us to all his friends.</P>
<P>And what mu&s;t we do in return for this well-meant kindne&s;s? Mu&s;t we not endeavour to weed out tho&s;e few errors, for few I hope they are, which impove|ri&s;h a mind in it&s;elf apparently fertile and of high rank?&mdash;Yes, it in&s;tantly &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf to me as an indi&s;pen&s;able act of duty&mdash;The attempt mu&s;t be made&mdash;With what ob&s;tinate warfare do

<HEAD>COKE CLIFTON TO HIS SISTER, LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;, pr&egrave;s le Pont Royal.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE agreeably to your de&s;ire, &s;i&s;ter, to thank you for all obligations, not forgetting your advice. Not but I am exce&s;&s;ively obliged to you; I am upon my &s;oul, and &s;eriou&s;ly, for having done me the favour to bring me ac|quainted with your charming friend.
<PB N="79" REF="85">
I have &s;een many women and in many countries, but I never beheld one &s;o &s;weet, &s;o beautiful, &s;o captivating! I had heard of her before I left England, her fame had reached Italy, and your letters had rai&s;ed my expectations. But what were the&s;e? The accompli&s;hments and graces of her per&s;on, the variety, the plea&s;ure in&s;piring heaven of her countenance, the cupids that wanton in her dimples, and the delights that &s;wim and gli&s;ten in her eyes, are each and all exqui&s;ite beyond imagination!</P>
<P>Whatever you may think of me, Loui&s;a, I do per&s;uade my&s;elf I know &s;omething of women. I have &s;tudied them at home and abroad, and have often probed them to the &s;oul. But I never before met with any one in the
<PB N="80" REF="86">
lea&s;t comparable to the divine Anna! She is &s;o unre&s;erved, &s;o open, that her &s;oul &s;eems to dwell upon her lips. Yet her thoughts are &s;o rapid, and her mind &s;o capacious, that I am per&s;uaded it will co&s;t me much longer time to know her well than any other woman with whom I ever met.</P>
<P>Having thanked you very heartily and &s;incerely for this favour, I &s;hall ju&s;t &s;ay a word or two in an&s;wer to yours.</P>
<P>And &s;o you really think you have &s;ome morality on hand, a little &s;tale or &s;o but &s;till &s;ound, which you can be&s;tow with advantage upon me? You ima|gine you can tell me &s;omething I never heard before? Now have you &s;incerely &s;o much vanity, Loui&s;a? Be frank. You acknowledge I have cro&s;&s;ed rivers,
<PB N="81" REF="87">
&s;eas, and mountains; but you are afraid I have &s;hut my eyes all the time! <HI>A loud tongue and a prodigious lack of wit! Antics and impertinences of young men of fa&s;hion!</HI> Really, my dear, you are choice in your phra&s;es! You could not love your bro|ther <HI>for any recital of the delight which foreign ladies took in him, and which he took in foreign ladies!</HI> But you could be in ec&s;tatics for a brother of your own in|vention.</P>
<P>Do not &s;uppo&s;e I am angry! No, no, my dear girl; I am got far above all that! Though I cannot but laugh at this extraordinary brother, which you are fa&s;hioning for your&s;elf. If, when I come into your &s;ublime pre&s;ence, I &s;hould by good luck happen to &s;trike your fancy, why &s;o! My fortune will
<PB N="82" REF="88">
then be made! If not, &s;i&s;ter, we mu&s;t do as well as we can. All in good time, and a God's name. Is not that tolerable Worce&s;ter&s;hire morality?</P>
<P>I am obliged to lay down my pen with laughing at the idea of Mi&s;s Lou|i&s;a's brother, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be exactly of her modelling. I think I &s;ee him ap|pear before her; &s;he &s;eated in &s;tate, on a chair rai&s;ed on four tre&s;&s;els and two old doors, like a &s;trolling actre&s;s mi|micking a queen in a barn! He dre&s;&s;ed in black; his hair &s;mugly curled; his face and his &s;hoes &s;hining; his white handkerchief in his right hand; a prayer book, or the morals of Epictetus in his left; <HI>not interlarding his di&s;cour&s;e with French or Italian phra&s;es,</HI> but ready with a good rumbling mouthful of old Greek,
<PB N="83" REF="89">
which he had compo&s;ed, I mean com|piled, for the purpo&s;e! Then, having advanced one leg, wiped his mouth, put his left hand in his breeches pocket, clenched his right, and rai&s;ed his arm, he begins his learned di&s;&s;ertation on <HI>well dige&s;ted principles, ardent de&s;ire of truth, ince&s;&s;ant &s;truggles to &s;hake off preju|dices,</HI> and forth are chanted, in na&s;al twang and tragic recitative, his <HI>emana|tions of &s;oul, bur&s;ts of thought,</HI> and <HI>fla&s;hes of genius!</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>you would not be &s;atirical.</HI> Gentle, mode&s;t maiden! And &s;urely it becomes the tutored brother to imitate this kind forbearance. <HI>My faculties were always lively?</HI> And <HI>I mu&s;t pardon you if you expect too much?&mdash;</HI>Upon my &s;oul, this is highly comic! Expect too much!
<PB N="84" REF="90">
And there is danger then that I &s;hould not equal your expectations?&mdash;Prithee, my good girl, jingle the keys of your harp&s;ichord, and be quiet. Pore over your fine folio receipt book, and appea&s;e your thir&s;t after knowledge. Satisfy your longing de&s;ire to do good, by making jellies, con&s;erves, and caraway cakes. Pot pippins, brew ra&s;berry wine, and candy orange chips. Study burns, brui&s;es, and bal&s;ams. Di&s;til &s;urfeit, colic, and wormwood water. Concoct hiera picra, rhubarb beer, and oil of charity; and &s;ympathize over &s;prains, whitloes, and broken &s;hins. Get a charm to cure the ague, and render your&s;elf renowned. Spin, &s;ew, and knit. Collect your lamentable rabble around you, dole out your charities, li&s;ten to a
<PB N="85" REF="91">
full chorus of ble&s;&s;ings, and take your &s;eat among the &s;aints.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, child, I can give advice as well as your&s;elf; aye and I will be&s;tow it mo&s;t plentifully, if you happen to feel any de&s;ire after more. I hate to be un|grateful; you &s;hall have no opportunity to utter your mu&s;ty maxim upon me&mdash;"That the &s;in of ingratitude is wor&s;e than the &s;in of witchcraft." You &s;hall have weight for weight, mea&s;ure for mea&s;ure, chicken; aye, my market woman, and a lumping pennyworth. Brotherly for &s;i&s;terly <HI>effu&s;ions!</HI></P>
<P>As for the right of elder&s;hip, I recol|lect that a dozen years ago I envied you the prerogative; but now you are wel|come to it with all my heart. If, among your miraculous acquirements, you have
<PB N="86" REF="92">
any &s;ecret to make time &s;tand &s;till, by which you can teach me to remain at &s;weet five-and-twenty, and if you will di&s;clo&s;e it to me, I will not only pardon all your <HI>impertinences,</HI> as you &s;o <HI>pertinently</HI> call them, but do any other thing in rea|&s;on to &s;atisfy you; except turn philo&s;o|pher and feed upon carrots! Nay I will allow you to grow as old as you plea&s;e, you &s;hall have full enjoyment of the rights of elder&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;i&s;ter, I once more thank you for bringing me acquainted with your friend. You &s;eem to have "put powder in her drink;" and I freely tell you I wi&s;h &s;he loved me half as well as &s;he profe&s;&s;es to love her immaculate Loui&s;a. But the&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e are the <HI>fla&s;hes of genius,</HI> which you have taught
<PB N="87" REF="93">
her. However &s;he is an angel, and in her every thing is graceful.</P>
<P>As for your other prodigy, I &s;carcely know what to make of him; except that he &s;eems to have quite conceit enough of him&s;elf. Every other &s;entence is a contradiction of what the la&s;t &s;peaker ad|vanced. This is the fir&s;t time he ever ventured to cro&s;s his father's thre&s;hold, and yet he talks as familiarly of king|doms, governments, nations, manners, and other high &s;ounding phra&s;es, as if he had been &s;ecretary of &s;tate to king Minos, had ridden upon the white ele|phant, and &s;tudied under the Dalai Lama! He is the Great Mogul of po|liticians! And as for letters, &s;cience, and talents, he holds them all by patent right! He is &s;uch a monopolizer that
<PB N="88" REF="94">
no man el&s;e can get a mor&s;el! If he were not a plebeian, I could mo&s;t &s;in|cerely wi&s;h you were married to him; for then, whenever my &s;oul &s;hould hun|ger and thir&s;t after morality, I &s;hould know where to come and get a full meal. Though perhaps his not being a gentle|man would be no objection to you, at+lea&s;t your letter leads me to &s;u&s;pect as much.</P>
<P>Do not however mi&s;take me. I mean this jocularly. For I will not degrade my &s;i&s;ter &s;o much, as to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he has ever ca&s;t a thought on the &s;on either of the gardener or the &s;teward, of any man. Though, tied to her mother's apron|&s;tring and &s;hut up on the confines of Worce&s;ter&s;hire, &s;he may think proper to lecture and give rules of conduct to a
<PB N="89" REF="95">
brother who has &s;een the world, and &s;tudied both men and books of every kind, that is but a harmle&s;s and pardon|able piece of vanity. It ought to be laughed at, and for that rea&s;on I have laughed.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t, I will be willing to think as well of my &s;i&s;ter, as this &s;i&s;ter can be to think of her catechi&s;ed, and very patient, humble, younger brother,</P>

by which the&s;e &s;traight roads have been patched up, and their everla&s;ting elms planted?

The whole country &s;hould &s;oon be a garden! Tell me, Aby, is not the project a grand one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The plan is in reality much grander than the good knight &s;u&s;pected; if embraced at the will of a nation, in&s;tead of at the will of an individual.</NOTE>? What a di&s;patch of work!
<PB N="96" REF="102">
What a change of nature! I am ra|vi&s;hed with the thought!</P>
<P>As for any ideas of improvement to be picked up here, Abimelech, they mu&s;t not be expected. I &s;hall never forget the &s;amene&s;s of the &s;cene! So unlike the riches of Wenbourne-Hill! Sir Alexander would have a country open enough here, at lea&s;t. He would not complain of being &s;hut in. The wind may blow from what point it plea&s;es, and you have it on all &s;ides. Except the road-&s;ide elms I men|tioned, and now and then a coppice, which places they tell me are planted for the pre&s;ervation of the game, I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed there had not been a tree in the country; had I not been told that there were many large

fore&s;ts, to the right, and the left, out of &s;ight. For my part I don't know where they have hidden them, and &s;o mu&s;t take their word for the fact. 'Tis true indeed that we travelled a part of the way in the dark.</P>
<P>I was mentioning the game, Aby. The game laws here are excellently put in execution. Hares are as plenty as rabbits in a warren, partridges as tame as our dove-hou&s;e pigeons, and phea&s;ants that &s;eem as if they would come and feed out of your hand. For no &s;coundrel poacher dare mole&s;t them. If he did, I am not certain whether the lord of the manor could not hang him up in&s;tantly without judge or jury.</P>
<P>Though Frank tells me they have no juries here: which by the bye is odd
<PB N="98" REF="104">
enough; and as he &s;ays I &s;uppo&s;e it is a great &s;hame. For, as he put the ca&s;e to me, how &s;hould I like to have my e&s;tate &s;eized on, by &s;ome in&s;olent prince or duke? For you know, I being a ba|ronet in my own right, Aby, no one le&s;s in rank would dare infringe upon me. Well! How &s;hould I like to have this duke, or this prince, &s;eize upon my e&s;tate; and, in&s;tead of having my right tried by a &s;pecial jury of my peers, to have the cau&s;e decided by him who can get the prettie&s;t woman to plead for him, and who will pay her and his judges the be&s;t? For &s;uch Frank a&s;&s;ures me is the mode here! Now really all this is very bad; very bad indeed, and as he &s;ays wants reforming.</P>
<P>But as for the game laws, as I was
<PB N="99" REF="105">
&s;aying, Aby, they are excellently en|forced; and your poor ra&s;cals here are kept in very proper &s;ubjection. They are held to the grind&s;tone, as I may &s;ay. And &s;o they ought to be, Aby. For, I have often heard you &s;ay, what is a man but what he is worth? Which in cer|tain re&s;pects is very true. A gentleman of family and fortune, why he is a gen|tleman; and no in&s;olent beggar ought to dare to look him in the face, without his permi&s;&s;ion. But you, Aby, had always a very great &s;en&s;e of propriety, in the&s;e re&s;pects. And you have found your advantage in it; as indeed you ought. It is a pity, con&s;idering what a learned young man you have made your &s;on, that you did not teach him a little of your good &s;en&s;e in this particular.
<PB N="100" REF="106">
He is too full of contradiction: too con|fident by half.</P>
<P>Let me have a long and full and whole account of what you are doing, Aby. Tell me preci&s;ely how forward your work is, and the exact &s;pot where you are when each letter comes away. I know I need not caution you to keep tho&s;e idle fellows, the day labourers, to it. I never knew any man who worked them better. And yet, Aby, it is &s;urpri&s;ing the &s;ums that they have co&s;t me; but you are a very careful hone&s;t fellow; and they have done wonders, under my planning and your in&s;pection.</P>

<HEAD>COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE found it, Fairfax! The pearl of pearls! The ine&s;timable jewel! The unique! The world contains but one!&mdash;And what?&mdash;A woman! The woman of whom I told you!&mdash;Anna St. Ives!&mdash;You have &s;een the Venus de Medicis?&mdash;P&s;haw!&mdash;Stone! Inani|mate
<PB N="111" REF="117">
marble! But &s;he!&mdash;The very &s;ight of her is the height of luxury! The pure blood is &s;een to circulate! Tran&s;parent is the complexion which it illuminates!&mdash;And for &s;ymmetry, for motion, for grace, &s;culptor, painter, nor poet ever yet imagined &s;uch! De&s;ire langui&s;hes to behold her! The pa&s;&s;ions all are in arms, and the mere enjoyment of her pre&s;ence is &s;uperior to all that her &s;ex be&s;ide can give!</P>
<P>Do not &s;uppo&s;e me in my altitudes: all I can &s;ay, all you can imagine, are far &s;hort of the reality.</P>
<P>Then how unlike is her candour to the petty arts, the &s;hallow cunning of her &s;ex! Her heart is as open as her countenance; her thoughts flow, fear|le&s;s, to her lips. Original ideas, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="112" REF="118">
in words &s;o &s;elect, phra&s;es &s;o happy, as to a&s;toni&s;h and delight; a brilliancy and a &s;trength of fancy that di&s;dain limitation, and wit rapid and fa|tal as lightning to all oppo&s;ition; the&s;e and a thou&s;and other unde&s;cribable ex|cellencies are hers.</P>
<P>I love her&mdash;Love?&mdash;I adore her! Ay&mdash;Be not &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;Even to madne&s;s and marriage!&mdash;No matter for what I have beforetime &s;aid, or what I have thought, my mind is chang|ed. I have di&s;covered perfection which I did not imagine could exi&s;t. I re|nounce my former opinions; which ap|plied to the &s;ex in general were ortho|dox, but to her were bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>I would not be too &s;udden; I have not yet made any direct propo&s;al. But
<PB N="113" REF="119">
could I exi&s;t and forbear giving intima|tions? No. And how were they re|ceived? Why with all that unaffected frankne&s;s which did not pretend to mi&s;|under&s;tand but to meet them, to cheri&s;h hope, and to give a pro&s;pect of bli&s;s which mortal man can never merit.</P>
<P>She is all benevolence! Nay &s;he is too much &s;o. There is that young&s;ter here; that up&s;tart; he who bolted upon us and mouthed his Pindarics in the Ely|&s;ian Fields; the &s;urly groom of the chamber. This fellow has in&s;inuated him&s;elf into her favour, and the benig|nity of her &s;oul induces her to treat him with as much re&s;pect as if he were a gentleman.</P>
<P>The youth has &s;ome parts, &s;ome ideas: at lea&s;t he has plenty of words. But his
<PB N="114" REF="120">
arrogance is in&s;ufferable. He does not &s;eruple to interfere in the di&s;cour&s;e, ei|ther with me, Sir Arthur, or the angelic Anna! Nay &s;ets up for a reformer; and pretends to an in&s;olent &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding and wi&s;dom. Yet he was never &s;o long from home before in his life; has &s;een nothing, but has read a few books, and has been permitted to conver&s;e with this all intelligent deity.</P>
<P>I cannot deny but that the pedagogue &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;es me, with the novelty of his opinions; but they are extrava|gant. I have conde&s;cended, oftener than became me, to &s;hew how full of hyper|bole and paradox they were. Still he as con&s;tantly maintained them, with a kind of congruity that a&s;toni&s;hed me, and even rendered many of them plau&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="121">
But, exclu&s;ive of his ob&s;tinacy, the rude, pot companion loquacity of the fellow is highly offen&s;ive. He has no &s;en&s;e of inferiority. He &s;tands as erect, and &s;peaks with as little embarra&s;&s;ment and as loudly as the be&s;t of us: nay boldly a&s;&s;erts that neither riches, rank, nor birth have any claim. I have of|fered to buy him a beard, if he would but turn heathen philo&s;opher. I have &s;everal times indeed be&s;towed no &s;mall portion of ridicule upon him; but in vain. His retorts are always ready; and his intrepidity, in this kind of imperti|nence, is unexampled.</P>
<P>From &s;ome anecdotes which are told of him, I find he does not want per&s;onal courage; but he has no claim to cha&s;|ti&s;ement from a gentleman. Petty in|&s;ults
<PB N="116" REF="122">
he di&s;regards; and has &s;everal times put me almo&s;t beyond the power of forbearance, by his cool and cutting replies. His oratory is always ready; cut, dry, and fit for u&s;e; and damned in&s;olent oratory it frequently is.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity of his tenets can only be equalled by the effrontery with which they are maintained. Among the mo&s;t ridiculous of what he calls fir&s;t princi|ples is that of the equality of mankind. He is one of your levellers! Marry! His &s;uperior! Who is he? On what proud eminence can he be found? On &s;ome Wel&s;h mountain, or the pike of Teneriffe? Certainly not in any of the nether regions! What! Was not he the a&s;s that brayed to Balaam? And is he not now Mufti to the mules? He
<PB N="117" REF="123">
will if he plea&s;e! And if he plea&s;e he will let it alone! Di&s;pute his prerogative who dare! He derives from Adam; what time the world was all hail fellow well met! The &s;avage, the wild man o'the woods is his true liberty boy; and the orang outang his fir&s;t cou&s;in. A Lord is a merry andrew, a Duke a jack pud|ding, and a King a tom fool: his name is man!</P>
<P>Then, as to property, 'tis a tragic farce; 'tis his &s;overeign plea&s;ure to eat nectarines, grow them who will. Ano|ther Alexander, he; the world is all his own! Ay, and he will govern it as he be&s;t knows how! He will legi&s;late, dic|tate, dogmatize; for who &s;o infallible? What! Cannot Goliah crack a walnut?</P>
<P>As for arguments, it is but a&s;k and
<PB N="118" REF="124">
have: a peck at a bidding, and a good double handful over. I own I thought I knew &s;omething; but no, I mu&s;t to my horn book. Then, for a &s;imile, it is &s;acrilege; and mu&s;t be kicked out of the high court of logic! Sarca&s;m too is an ignoramus, and cannot &s;olve a problem: Wit a pert puppy, who can only fla&s;h and bounce. The heavy walls of wi&s;|dom are not to be battered down by &s;uch popguns and pellets. He will wa&s;te you wind enough to &s;et up twenty millers, in proving an apple is not an egg &s;hell; and that <HI>homo</HI> is Greek for a goo&s;e. Dun Scotus was a &s;chool boy to him. I confe&s;s, he has more than once dumb-founded me by his &s;ubtleties.&mdash;P&s;haw!&mdash;It is a mortal murder of words and time to be&s;tow them on him.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125">
My &s;i&s;ter is in corre&s;pondence with my new divinity. I thought proper to be&s;tow a few gentle la&s;hes on her, for a letter which &s;he wrote to me, and which I mentioned in my fir&s;t from Paris, in&s;i|nuating her own &s;uperiority, and giving me to under&s;tand how fortunate it would be for the world &s;hould I but prove as con&s;ummate a paragon as her&s;elf. She richly de&s;erved it, and yet I now wi&s;h I had forborne; for, if &s;he have her &s;ex's love of vengeance in her, &s;he may in|jure me in the tendere&s;t part. Never was woman &s;o devoted to woman as Anna St. Ives is to Loui&s;a. I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect any other of her &s;ex of extrava|gant affectation; but her it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;pect: her manner is &s;o peculiarly her own: and it comes with &s;uch un|&s;ought
<PB N="120" REF="126">
for energy, that there is no re&s;i&s;t|ing conviction.</P>
<P>I have two or three times been in|clined to write and a&s;k Loui&s;a's par|don. But, no; that pride forbids. She dare not openly profe&s;s her&s;elf my ene|my. She may in&s;inuate, and counter|mine; but I have a tolerably &s;trong dependance on my own power over Anna. She is not blind. She is the fir&s;t to feel and to acknowledge &s;uperior merit; and I think I have no rea&s;on to fear repul&s;e from any wo|man, who&s;e hand I can bring my&s;elf to a&s;k.</P>
<P>One of Anna's greate&s;t perfections, with me, is the ready e&s;teem which &s;he entertained for me, and her not being in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e qualities which I flat|ter
<PB N="121" REF="127">
my&s;elf I po&s;&s;e&s;s. Never yet did wo|man treat me with affected di&s;dain, who did not at la&s;t repent of her coquetry.</P>
<P>'Tis true that Anna has &s;ometimes piqued me, by appearing to value me more for my &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake even than for my own. I have been ready to &s;ay di&s;&s;imu|lation was in&s;eparable from woman. And yet her manner is as unlike hypo|cri&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. I never yet could brook &s;corn, or neglect. I know no &s;en&s;ation more delicious than that of in|flicting puni&s;hment for in&s;ult or for in|jury; 'tis in our nature.</P>
<P>That young&s;ter of whom I have prated &s;o much, his name is Frank Henley, denies this, and &s;ays that what the world calls nature is habit. He added, with &s;ome degree of &s;arca&s;m as
<PB N="122" REF="128">
I thought, that it was as natural, or in his &s;en&s;e as habitual, for &s;ome men to pardon, and to &s;eek the good even of tho&s;e by whom they were wronged, as it was for others to re&s;ent and endeavour to revenge. But, as I have &s;aid, he continually makes preten&s;ions to an of|fen&s;ive &s;uperiority. You may think I do not fail to humble the youth, when|ever opportunity offers. But no! Hum|ble him, indeed! Shew him boiling ice! Stew a whale in an oy&s;ter-&s;hell! Make mount Cauca&s;us into a bag pudding! But do not imagine he may be moved! The legitimate &s;on of Cato's elde&s;t ba&s;tard, he! A petrified Po&s;&s;idonius, in high pre|&s;ervation!</P>
<P>There is another thing which a&s;to|ni&s;hes me more than all I have men|tioned.
<PB N="123" REF="129">
Cur&s;e me, Fairfax, if I do not believe that [God confound the fellow!] he has the impudence to be in love with Anna St. Ives! Nay that he braves me, defies me, and, in the in&s;ufferable frothy fermentation of his vanity, per&s;uades him&s;elf that he looks down upon me!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fini&s;h, for I cannot think of his intolerable in&s;olence with common patience; and I know not what right I have to tea&s;e you, concerning my paltry di&s;putes with a plebeian pedant, and my &s;till more paltry jealou&s;ies.

from blaming you for having expre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Still, brother, I mu&s;t be &s;incere, and I would by no means have it under&s;tood that I think you have cho&s;en the be&s;t manner of expre&s;&s;ing them; for it is not the manner which, if I have &s;uch faults, would be mo&s;t likely to produce reformation. But your intention has been to humble me; and, de&s;iring to be &s;arca&s;tic, you have not failed in pro|ducing your intended effect. I am &s;in|cerely glad of it: had you &s;hewn that de&s;ire without the power, I &s;hould have been as &s;incerely &s;orry. But where there is mind there is the material from which every thing is to be hoped.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall again incur cha&s;ti&s;e|ment, for ri&s;ing thus as you call it to the
<PB N="127" REF="133">
&s;ublime. But I will write my thoughts without fear, and I hope will patiently li&s;ten &s;hould they de&s;erve reproach. If I have &s;inned, it is in mo&s;t fervently wi&s;h|ing to find my brother one of the brighte&s;t and the be&s;t of men; and I have received more plea&s;ure from the powers he has di&s;played, in reproving me, than I could have done by any dull expre&s;&s;ion of kindne&s;s; in which, though there might have been words, there would neither have been feeling, &s;enti|ment, nor &s;oul.</P>
<P>The concluding &s;entence of your let|ter warns me not to defame you with my friend. I mu&s;t &s;peak without di&s;|gui&s;e, brother. You feel that, had you received &s;uch a letter, revenge would have been the fir&s;t emotion of your
<PB N="128" REF="134">
mind. I hope its duration would have been &s;hort. I will mo&s;t readily and warmly repeat all the good of my bro|ther that I know: but I will neither conceal what ought to be &s;aid, nor &s;ay what I do not know. I take it for granted that he would not have me guilty of duplicity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel d'E&s;pagne, Rue Guenegaude, Fauxbourg St. Germain.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW &s;evere, Oliver, are the le&s;&s;ons of truth! But to learn them from her lips, and to be excited to the practice of them by her example, are ble&s;&s;ings which to enjoy and not to profit by would &s;hew a degenerate heart.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136">
I have ju&s;t ri&s;en from a conver&s;ation which has made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind. It was during breakfa&s;t. I know not whether reflecting on it will appea&s;e, or increa&s;e, the &s;en&s;ations which the behaviour of this brother of Loui&s;a hourly exacerbates. But I will calm that irritability which would dwell on him, and nothing el&s;e, that I may repeat what has ju&s;t happened.</P>
<P>The intere&s;ting part of what pa&s;&s;ed began by Mr. Clifton's affirming, with Pope, that men had and would have, to the end of time, each a ruling pa&s;&s;ion. This I denied, if by ruling pa&s;&s;ion were meant the indulgence of any irregular appetite, or the fo&s;tering of any errone|ous &s;y&s;tem. I was a&s;ked, with a &s;neer, for my recipe to &s;ubdue the pa&s;&s;ions; if
<PB N="131" REF="137">
it were not too long to be remembered. I replied it was equally brief and effica|cious. It was the force of rea&s;on; or, if the word &s;hould plea&s;e better, of truth.</P>
<P>And in what year of the world was the di&s;covery of truth to be made?</P>
<P>In that very year when, in&s;tead of being per&s;ecuted for &s;peaking their thoughts, the free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every opinion, true or fal&s;e, &s;hould not only be permitted, but receive encourage|ment and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>As u&s;ual, the appeal was made to Anna: and, as u&s;ual, her deci&s;ion was in my favour. Nothing, &s;aid &s;he, is more fatal, to the progre&s;s of virtue, than the &s;uppo&s;ition that error is invin|cible. Had I per&s;uaded my&s;elf I never could have learned French, Italian, or
<PB N="132" REF="138">
mu&s;ic, why learn them I never could. For how can that be fini&s;hed which is ne|ver begun? But, though all the world were to laugh at me, I &s;hould laugh at all the world, were it to tell me it is more difficult to prevent the beginning, growth, and ex|ce&s;s of any pa&s;&s;ion, than it is to learn to play excellently on the piano forte.</P>
<P>Is that really your opinion, madam? &s;aid Clifton.</P>
<P>It is.</P>
<P>Do you include all the pa&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>All.</P>
<P>What! The pa&s;&s;ion of love?</P>
<P>Yes. Love is as certainly to be con|quered as any of them; and there is no mi&s;take which has done more mi&s;chief than that of &s;uppo&s;ing it irre&s;i&s;tible. Young people, and we poor girls in par|ticular,
<PB N="133" REF="139">
having once been thoroughly per&s;uaded of the truth of &s;uch an axiom, think it in vain to &s;truggle, where there are no hopes of victory. We are con|quered not becau&s;e we are weak, but becau&s;e we are cowards. We &s;eem to be convinced that we have fallen in love by enchantment, and are under the ab|&s;olute dominion of a necromancer. It is truly the dwarf leading the giant cap|tive. Is it not&mdash;[Oliver! She fixed her eyes upon me, as &s;he &s;poke!]&mdash;Is it not, Frank?</P>
<P>I was confounded. I pau&s;ed for a mo|ment. A deep and heavy &s;igh involun|tarily bur&s;t from me. I endeavoured to be firm, but I &s;tammered out&mdash;Ma|dam&mdash;it is.</P>
<P>I am convinced he is jealous of me.
<PB N="134" REF="140">
Nay he fears me; though he &s;corns me too much to think &s;o meanly of him&s;elf. Yet he fears me. And what is wor&s;e, Oliver, I fear him! I blu&s;h for my own debility. But let me not endea|vour to conceal my weakne&s;s. No: it mu&s;t be encountered, and cured. His quick and audacious eye was &s;earching me, while I &s;truggled to think, and rid my&s;elf of confu&s;ion; and he di&s;covered more than gave him plea&s;ure.&mdash;She con|tinued.</P>
<P>I know of no prejudice more perni|cious to the moral conduct of youth than that of this unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion of love. Any and all of our pa&s;&s;ions are unconquerable, whenever we &s;hall be weak enough to think them &s;o. Does not the game&s;ter plead the unconquer|ablene&s;s
<PB N="135" REF="141">
of his pa&s;&s;ion? The drunkard, the man of anger, the revengeful, the envious, the covetous, the jealous, have they not all the &s;ame plea? With the &s;elfi&s;h and the feeble pa&s;&s;ion &s;ucceeds to pa&s;&s;ion as different habits give birth to each, and the la&s;t pa&s;&s;ion proves more unconquerable than its predece&s;&s;or. How frequently do we &s;ee people in the very fever of this unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion of love, which di&s;appears for the re&s;t of their lives, after a few weeks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object whom they had &s;o pa&s;&s;ion|ately loved! How often do they as pa&s;&s;ionately hate; while the violence of their hatred and of their love is perhaps equally guilty!</P>
<P>Sir Arthur I ob&s;erved was happy to join in this new doctrine, which how|ever
<PB N="136" REF="142">
is true, Oliver. I am not certain that he too had not his apprehen&s;ions, concerning me: at lea&s;t his approbation of the principle was ardent.</P>
<P>This was not all. After a &s;hort &s;ilence, &s;he added, and again fixed her eyes on me&mdash;Next to the ta&s;k of &s;ub|duing our own pa&s;&s;ions, I know none more noble than that of aiding to &s;ubdue the pa&s;&s;ions of others. To re&s;tore a lan|gui&s;hing body is held to be a precious art: but to give health to the mind, to re&s;tore declining genius to its true rank, is an art infinitely more ine&s;timable.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e, and I withdrew; her words vibrating in my ear, where they vibrate &s;till. Perceive&s;t thou not their im|port?&mdash;Oliver, &s;he has formed a pro|ject fatal to my hopes! Nay, I could
<PB N="137" REF="143">
almo&s;t fear, fatal to her&s;elf! Yet what, who can harm her? Does the &s;avage, the mon&s;ter exi&s;t, that could look upon her and do her injury? No! She is &s;afe! She is immaculate! Beaming in beauty, &s;upreme in virtue, the re&s;plen|dent aegis of truth &s;hields her from at|taint!</P>
<P>Yes, Oliver, her an&s;wers were to him; but the intent, the &s;oul of them was di|rected to me. It was a warning &s;pirit, that cried, beware of indulging an unju&s;|tifiable pa&s;&s;ion! Awake, at the call of virtue, and obey! Behold here a &s;ickly mind, and aid me in its recovery!&mdash;To me her language was pointed, clear, and incapable of other interpretation.</P>
<P>But is there not peril in her plan? Recover a mind &s;o perverted? Strong,
<PB N="138" REF="144">
I own, nay uncommon in its powers; for &s;uch the mind of Clifton is: but its &s;trength is its di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>And is it &s;o certain that for me to love her is error, is weakne&s;s, is vice? No. Or, if it be, I have not yet di&s;covered why. Oliver, &s;he &s;hall hear me! Let her &s;hew me my mi&s;take, if mi&s;taken I be, and I will de&s;i&s;t: but ju&s;tice de|mands it, and &s;he &s;hall hear me.</P>
<P>We are going to remove, at his re|peated in&s;tances, to the hotel where he re&s;ides. He leads Sir Arthur as he plea&s;es; but it grieved me to &s;ee her yield &s;o readily. Now that I have di&s;|covered her intentions, I no longer wonder. Omnipotent as the power of truth and virtue is, I yet cannot approve the de&s;ign. The enterpri&s;es of virtue
<PB N="139" REF="145">
it&s;elf may have their romance&mdash;I know not&mdash;This to me at lea&s;t is fatal&mdash;Could I&mdash;? I mu&s;t conclude!&mdash;Lo&s;e her?&mdash;For ever!&mdash;For ever!&mdash;I mu&s;t conclude&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE a&s;&s;iduity of Clifton, my dear Loui&s;a, is &s;o great that we already &s;eem to be acquaintance of &s;even years &s;tand|ing. This is evidently his intention. His temper is eager, impatient of delay, quick in re&s;olving, and, if I do not mi&s;take, &s;ometimes precipitate. But his intellectual powers are of a very high order. His wit is keen, his invention
<PB N="141" REF="147">
&s;trong, his language flowing and ele|gant, and his ideas and figures remarka|ble, &s;ometimes for their humour, and at others for their &s;plendour. His preju|dices are many of them deep; nor are they few; but he &s;peaks them frankly, defends them boldly, and courts rather than &s;huns di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. What then may not be hoped from a mind like his? Ought &s;uch a mind to be neglected? No!&mdash;No!&mdash;Eternally no!&mdash;I have al|ready given a &s;trong hint of this to Frank.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that, &s;ince you &s;aw him, he is greatly improved in per&s;on. The regularity of his features, his florid complexion, tall &s;tature, and the facility and grace of all his motions, are with him no common advantages.</P>
<P>He has attached him&s;elf exceedingly
<PB N="142" REF="148">
to us, and has induced Sir Arthur to take apartments in the <HI>Hotel de l'Univer|&s;it&eacute;,</HI> where he re&s;ides him&s;elf, and where the accommodations are much better, the &s;ituation more agreeable, and the rooms more &s;pacious.</P>
<P>A little incident happened, when we removed, which was characteri&s;tic of the manners of the people, and drew forth a plea&s;ing trait of the acutene&s;s of Clifton, and of his turn of thinking.</P>
<P>One of the men who helped us with our luggage, after being paid according to agreement, a&s;ked, as is very cu&s;tomary with the&s;e people, for <HI>quelque cho&s;e &agrave; boire;</HI> which Sir Arthur, not being very expert in the French idiom, under&s;tood literally. He accordingly ordered a bottle of the light common wine, and
<PB N="143" REF="149">
being thir&s;ty poured &s;ome into a tum|bler and drank him&s;elf fir&s;t, then poured out &s;ome more, and offered the proter.</P>
<P>The man took the gla&s;s as Sir Arthur held it out to him; and, with &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e and evident &s;en&s;e of in&s;ult in his countenance, &s;aid to Sir Arthur<HI>&mdash;&agrave; moi, mon&s;ieur?</HI> To which Sir Arthur, per|fectly at a lo&s;s to comprehend his mean|ing, made no an&s;wer; and the man, without ta&s;ting the liquor, &s;et the gla&s;s down on a bench in the yard.</P>
<P>Clifton, well acquainted with the manners of the people, and knowing the man imagined Sir Arthur meant to in|&s;ult him, by giving him the &s;ame gla&s;s out of which he had drunken, with great alacrity took it up the moment the man had &s;et it down, and &s;aid<HI>&mdash;Non, mon</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="150">
<HI>ami, c'e&s;t &agrave; moi&mdash;</HI>and drank off the wine. He then called for another tum|bler, and filling it gave it to the man.</P>
<P>The French are a people of active and lively feelings; and the poor fellow, after receiving the gla&s;s from Clifton, took up the other empty tumbler, pour|ed the wine back into it, &s;aid in his own language forgive me, &s;ir; I &s;ee I am in the wrong; and immediately drank out of the tumbler which he had before re|fu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Each country you perceive, Loui&s;a, has its own ideas of delicacy. The French think it very &s;trange to &s;ee two people drink out of the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el. Not however that I &s;uppo&s;e every porter in Paris would refu&s;e wine, if offered, for the &s;ame rea&s;on. Neither would they
<PB N="145" REF="151">
all with the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility be &s;o ready to retract.</P>
<P>The good humour as well as the good &s;en&s;e of Clifton's reproof plea&s;ed me highly; and we mu&s;t all acknowledge him our &s;uperior, in the art of ea&s;ily con|forming to the cu&s;toms of foreigners, and in readily pardoning even their ab&s;urdi|ties. For foreigners, Loui&s;a, have their ab&s;urdities, as well as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But I have not yet done. I have another anecdote to relate of Clifton, from which I augur &s;till more.</P>
<P>I had ob&s;erved our Thomas in conver|&s;ation with a man, who from his dre&s;s and talking to Thomas I knew mu&s;t be an Engli&s;hman; and the care which it becomes me to take, that &s;uch well|meaning but &s;imple people &s;hould not
<PB N="146" REF="152">
be deceived, led me to inquire who he was. Thomas began to &s;tammer; not with guilt, but with a de&s;ire of telling a &s;tory which he knew not how to tell &s;o well as he wi&s;hed. At la&s;t we under&s;tood from him it was a young Engli&s;h lad, who had neither money, meat, nor work, and who was in danger of &s;tarving, be|cau&s;e he could find no means of return|ing to his own country. Poor Thomas finding him&s;elf among a kind of hea|thens, as he calls the French, pitied his ca&s;e very &s;incerely, and had &s;upplied him with food for &s;ome days, promi&s;ing that he would &s;oon take an opportunity of &s;peaking to me, whom he is plea&s;ed to call the be&s;t young lady in the world; and I a&s;&s;ure you, Loui&s;a, I am proud of his good word.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="153">
Your brother heard this account, and immediately &s;aid&mdash;[For indeed I wi&s;h|ed to know what his feelings were, and therefore did not offer to interrupt him.] "De&s;ire him to come up. Let me que&s;tion him. If he be really what he &s;ays, he ought to be relieved: but he is very likely &s;ome idle fellow, who being Engli&s;h makes a trade of watching for Engli&s;h families, and living upon this tale." So far &s;aid I to my&s;elf, Clifton, all is right. I therefore let him proceed. The lad came up, for he was not twenty, and your brother began his interroga|tions.</P>
<P>You are an Engli&s;h lad, you &s;ay?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Where do you come from?</P>
<P>Wolverhampton.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="154">
What is your trade?</P>
<P>A buckle plater.</P>
<P>And did you &s;erve out your appren|tice&s;hip?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter and I quarrelled, he &s;truck me, I beat him, and was obliged to run away.</P>
<P>Where did you run to?</P>
<P>I went to London. I have an aunt there, a poor woman, who chairs for gentlefolks, and I went to her.</P>
<P>How came you here?</P>
<P>She got me a place, with a young gentleman who was going on his travels. I had been among hor&s;es before I was bound 'prentice, and he hired me as his groom.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="155">
But how came you to leave him?</P>
<P>He is a very pa&s;&s;ionate gentleman. He has got a French footman, who &s;tands and &s;hrugs, and lets him give him thumps, and kicks; and one morning, becau&s;e one boot was brighter than t'other, he was going to hor&s;ewhip me. So I told him to keep his hands off, or I would knock him down.</P>
<P>Why you are quite a fighting fellow.</P>
<P>No, &s;ir; I never fought with any body in my life, if they did not fir&s;t meddle with me.</P>
<P>So you quarrelled with your ma&s;ter, beat him, ran away from your appren|tice&s;hip, got a place, came into a foreign country, and then, becau&s;e your ma&s;ter did not happen to plea&s;e you, threaten|ed to knock him down!</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156">
The poor fellow was quite confound|ed, and I was half out of breath from an apprehen&s;ion that Clifton had taken the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion. But I was &s;oon relieved&mdash;This tale is too artle&s;s to be fal&s;e, &s;aid he, turning to me.&mdash;You cannot conceive, Loui&s;a, the infinite plea&s;ure which the&s;e few words gave me&mdash;I &s;till continued &s;i|lent, and watching, not the lad, but your brother.</P>
<P>So you never meddle with any body who does not meddle with you?</P>
<P>No, &s;ir. I would &s;corn it.</P>
<P>But you will not be hor&s;ewhipped?</P>
<P>No, &s;ir, I won't; &s;tarve or not &s;tarve.</P>
<P>I need not a&s;k you if you are hone&s;t, &s;ober, and indu&s;trious; for I know you will &s;ay you are.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="157">
Why &s;hould I not, &s;ir?</P>
<P>You have nobody to give you a cha|racter, have you?</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter is &s;till in Paris; but to be &s;ure he will give me a bad one.</P>
<P>Can you tell me his addre&s;s&mdash;where he lives?</P>
<P>I can't tell it in French, but here it is.</P>
<P>Can you write and read?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir.</P>
<P>And how long have you been out of place?</P>
<P>Above &s;even weeks.</P>
<P>Why did not you return to England, when you received your wages?</P>
<P>I had no money. I owed a fellow &s;ervant a guinea and a half, which I had borrowed to buy &s;hirts and &s;tockings.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e you have made away with?</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="158">
Not all. I was obliged to take &s;ome of them to Mount Pity.</P>
<P><HI>Mont Pi&eacute;t&eacute;,</HI> you mean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The general receptacle for pledges. Among other monopolies and trades, government in France u&s;ed to be the common pawnbroker.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Belike yes, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Well, here's &s;omething for you, for the pre&s;ent; and come to me to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>The lad went away, with more in his countenance than he knew how to put into &s;peech; and I a&s;ked Clifton what he meant by de&s;iring him to come again. I intend, madam, &s;aid he, to make &s;ome inquiries of his ma&s;ter; and if they plea&s;e me to hire him; for I want a &s;er|vant, and if I am not deceived he will make a good one.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="159">
Think, Loui&s;a, whether I were not plea&s;ed with this proof of di&s;cernment. By this accident, I learned more of Clifton's character in ten minutes than perhaps I might have done in ten months. He &s;aw, for I wi&s;hed him to &s;ee, that he had acted exactly as I could have de&s;ired.</P>
<P>He appears indeed to be a favourite with &s;ervants, which certainly is no bad omen. He is Laura's delight. He is a free gentleman, a generous gentle|man, [I &s;uppo&s;e he gives her money] a merry gentleman, and has the hand|&s;ome&s;t per&s;on, the fine&s;t eye, and the be&s;t manner of dre&s;&s;ing his hair &s;he ever beheld!&mdash;She quite overflows in his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>In a few days we are to go to the
<PB N="154" REF="160">
country &s;eat of the Marquis of Ville|brun, where we intend to &s;tay about a fortnight. Your brother has introduced us to all his friends, among whom is the marquis; and, as we are intimate with our amba&s;&s;ador, we have more invita|tions than we can accept, and acquaint|ance than we can cultivate. Frank is to go with us.</P>
<P>And now, Loui&s;a, with anxiety I own, my mind is far from &s;atisfied. I have not thought &s;ufficiently to convince my&s;elf, yet act as though I had. It is little le&s;s than open war between your brother and Frank. The &s;uppo&s;ition of a duty, too &s;erious to be trifled with, has induced me to favour rather than repul&s;e the too eager advances of Clif|ton;
<PB N="155" REF="161">
though this &s;uppo&s;ed duty has been but half examined.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire to retrieve mind cannot but be right; yet the mode may be wrong.</P>
<P>At this moment my heart bitterly re|proaches me, for not proceeding on more certain principles. The merit of Frank is great, almo&s;t beyond the power of ex|pre&s;&s;ion. I need not tell my Loui&s;a which way affection, were it encouraged, would incline: but I will not be its &s;lave. Nor can I reproach my&s;elf for erring on that &s;ide; but for acting, in re&s;i&s;tance to inclination, with too little re&s;erve. No arguments I believe can &s;hew me that I have a right to &s;port with the feelings of my father, and my friends; though tho&s;e feelings are found|ed
<PB N="156" REF="162">
in prejudice. But my inquiries &s;hall be more minute; and my re&s;olves will then be more permanent and &s;elf-com|placent.</P>
<P>Adieu, my be&s;t and deare&s;t friend. Write often: reprove me for all that I do ami&s;s&mdash;Would my mind were more accordant with it&s;elf! But I will take it roundly to ta&s;k.</P>

<P>IT is as I told thee, Oliver. He fears me. He treats me, as he thinks, with the neglect and contempt due to an unqualified intru|der: but he mi&s;takes his own motives, and acts with in&s;idious jealou&s;y; nay de&s;cends to artifice. His alarmed &s;pirit never re&s;ts; he is ever on the watch, le&s;t at entering a room, de&s;cending a &s;tairca&s;e, &s;tepping into
<PB N="161" REF="167">
her carriage, or on any other occa&s;ion, I &s;hould touch her hand. He has endea|voured to exclude me from all their par|ties; and, though often &s;ucce&s;sfully, has &s;everal times been foiled.</P>
<P>But his greate&s;t di&s;appointment was this very morning. Sir Arthur &s;ent for me, la&s;t night, to inform me I mu&s;t re|turn to Wenbourne-Hill, with &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary orders, which he did not choo&s;e to tru&s;t to the u&s;ual mode of conveyance. I immediately &s;u&s;pected, and I think I did not do him inju&s;tice, that my rival was the contriver of this &s;udden nece&s;&s;ity of my return.</P>
<P>I received Sir Arthur's orders, but was determined immediately to acquaint Anna.</P>
<P>Clifton was pre&s;ent. She was &s;ur|pri&s;ed;
<PB N="162" REF="168">
and, I doubt not, had the &s;ame &s;u&s;picions as my&s;elf; for, after telling me I mu&s;t not think of going, &s;he obliged Clifton him&s;elf to be the inter|ce&s;&s;or, with Sir Arthur, that I &s;hould &s;tay. His reluctance, feigned a&s;&s;ent, and chagrin were vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Her words and manner to me were kind; nay I could almo&s;t think they were &s;omewhat more. She &s;eemed to feel the inju&s;tice aimed at me; and to feel it with as much re&s;entment as a &s;pi|rit &s;o benignant could know.</P>
<P>What!&mdash;Can he not be &s;atisfied with half excluding me from her &s;ociety; with endeavouring to &s;ink me as low in her e&s;timation as in his own; and with ex|erci&s;ing all that arrogance which he &s;up|po&s;es becoming the character of a gentle|man?</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="169">
Oliver, I am determined in my plan: my appeal &s;hall be to her ju&s;tice. If it prove to be ill-founded, why then I mu&s;t acquie&s;ce. I am angry at my own delay, at my own want of courage; but I &s;hall find a time, and that quickly. At lea&s;t, if condemned I mu&s;t be, I will be heard; but equity I think is on my &s;ide&mdash;Yes&mdash;I will be heard.</P>

<P>AID me if thou can&s;t, Oliver, to think, or rather to unravel my own en|tangled thoughts. Do not &s;uffer me to continue in a &s;tate of delu&s;ion, if thou perceive&s;t it to be &s;uch. Be explicit; tell me if thou do&s;t but &s;o much as fore|bode: for at moments I my&s;elf de&s;pond; though at others I am wafted to the hea|ven
<PB N="165" REF="171">
of heavens, to certainty, and bli&s;s unutterable. If I deceive my&s;elf?&mdash;Well!&mdash;And if I do, what is to follow?&mdash;Ra&s;hne&s;s?&mdash;Cowardice?&mdash;What! Ba&s;ely abandon duty, virtue, and energy?&mdash;No!</P>
<P>Looks, words, appearances, daily events are all &s;o contradictory, that the warfare of hope and fear increa&s;es, and becomes violent, almo&s;t to di&s;traction! Clifton is openly countenanced by Sir Arthur, treated kindly by her, and is in|ce&s;&s;ant in every kind of a&s;&s;iduity. His qualities are neither mean, in&s;ignificant, nor common. No: they are brilliant, and rare. With a per&s;on as near per|fection as his mind will permit it to be, a knowledge of languages, a ta&s;te for the fine arts, much bravery, high notions of
<PB N="166" REF="172">
honour, a more than common &s;hare of wit, keen and ungovernable feelings, an impatience of contradiction, and an ob|&s;tinacy in error, he is a compound of jarring elements, that augur tempe&s;ts and peril. Vain, haughty, and &s;elf-willed, his family, his fortune, his ac|compli&s;hments and him&s;elf are the pic|tures that fa&s;cinate his eye. It is at|tracted, for a moment, by the &s;uperior powers of another; but all his pa&s;&s;ions and propen&s;ities forebode that he is not to be held, even by that link of ada|mant.</P>
<P>And is &s;he to be dazzled then by this glare? Can her attention be caught by per&s;on, attracted by wit? And does &s;he not &s;hrink from that haughty pride which &s;o continually turns to contem|plate
<PB N="167" REF="173">
it&s;elf; from tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are &s;o eager to be gratified; and from tho&s;e mi&s;takes which it will be &s;o almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to eradicate? Even were I to lo&s;e her, mu&s;t I &s;ee her thus de|voted?&mdash;The thought is&mdash;I cannot tell what! Too painful for any word &s;hort of extravagance.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed by feelings like the&s;e, the other day I &s;at down and threw a few ideas into ver&s;e. The mind, &s;urcharged with pa&s;&s;ion, is eager by every means to di&s;burthen it&s;elf. It is always prompt to hope that the expre&s;&s;ion of it's feel|ings, if any way adequate, cannot but produce the effect it wi&s;hes; and I wrote the following &s;ong, or love-elegy, or what thou wilt.</P>

el&s;ewhere, to the piano-forte; and made &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to plea&s;e my&s;elf with an air to them. Sir Arthur came in, and I left my &s;tanzas on the de&s;k of the in&s;trument; very inadver|tently I a&s;&s;ure thee, though I was after|ward far from &s;orry that they had been forgotten.</P>
<P>I have frequently indulged my&s;elf in &s;itting in an antichamber, to li&s;ten to her playing and &s;inging. I have thought that &s;he is mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned when alone, and perhaps all mu&s;icians are &s;o. The next day, happening to li&s;ten in the manner I have mentioned, I heard her &s;inging an air which was new to me, and remarked that &s;he once or twice &s;topped, to con&s;ider and make alterations.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="176">
I li&s;tened again and found &s;he had been &s;etting my ver&s;es!</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, Oliver, I have no con|ception of rapture &s;uperior to what I experienced at that moment! She had collected all her feelings, all her inven|tion, had compo&s;ed a mo&s;t beautiful air, and &s;ung it with an effect that mu&s;t have been heard to be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;i|ble. The force with which &s;he uttered every thought to the climax of daring, and the compa&s;&s;ion which &s;he infu&s;ed into the conclu&s;ion&mdash;"But do not dare to love"&mdash;produced the mo&s;t affecting contra&s;t I ever heard.</P>

entrance of Clifton. I followed him, and &s;aw her &s;hut the book, and wipe the tear from her eye. Her flow of &s;pirits is unfailing, but the tone of her mind was rai&s;ed too high &s;uddenly to &s;ink into trifling. She looked at me two or three times. I know not for my part what a&s;pect I wore; but I could ob&s;erve that the haughty Clifton felt the gaiety of his heart in &s;ome &s;ort di&s;turbed, and was not plea&s;ed to catch me li&s;tening, with &s;uch mute attention, to the ravi&s;h|ing mu&s;ic &s;he had made.</P>
<P>Once again prithee tell me, Oliver, what am I to think? It was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould have &s;ung as &s;he did, had not the ideas affected her more than I could have hoped, nay as much as they did my&s;elf. She knew the writing. Why
<PB N="172" REF="178">
did &s;he &s;igh? Why feel indignant? Why expre&s;s every &s;entiment that had pa&s;&s;ed through my mind with increa&s;ing force?&mdash;What could &s;he think?&mdash;Did &s;he not approve?&mdash;She &s;ung as if &s;he admired!&mdash;The world &s;hall not per&s;uade me that her looks were not the true expre&s;&s;ions of her heart; and &s;he looked&mdash;! Recollect her, and the tem|per of mind &s;he was in, and imagine how!&mdash;Remember<HI>&mdash;She could love me if I would let her!</HI></P>
<P>I was di&s;plea&s;ed with the ver&s;es when I had written them: they were very ina|dequate to what I wi&s;hed. I di&s;covered in &s;ome of the lines a barren repetition of the preceding thought, and meant to have corrected them. But I would not now alter a word for worlds! She has
<PB N="173" REF="179">
deigned to &s;et and &s;ing them; and what was before but of little worth is now in|e&s;timable.</P>
<P>Yet am I far from &s;atisfied with my|&s;elf. My pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind is di&s;|graceful; for it cannot but be di&s;grace|ful to be kept in doubt by my own cow|ardice.

The difficulty of retreating momentarily increa&s;es, and every &s;tep in advance will be miles in return.</P>
<P>Clifton will &s;uffer no impediment from the cowardice of which I complain; for I much mi&s;take if he has been accu&s;|tomed to refu&s;al; or if he can &s;carcely think, when he deigns to &s;ue, denial po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="180">
I find my&s;elf every day determining to put an end to this &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and every day delaying. The impul&s;e however is too great to be long re&s;i&s;ted; and my excu&s;e to my&s;elf continually is that I have not yet found the proper mo|ment.</P>
<P>If, Oliver, this hi&s;tory of my heart be trouble&s;ome to thee, it is thy duty to tell me &s;o. But indeed thou telle&s;t me the contrary; and I know not why at this in&s;tant I &s;hould do thee the inju&s;tice to doubt thy &s;incerity. Forgive me. It is a friendly fear, and not intended to do thee wrong.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IFEAR, my dear Loui&s;a, I am at I re&s;ent hurried forward a little too fa&s;t to act with all the caution which I could wi&s;h. My mind is not coherent, not at peace with it&s;elf. Ideas ru&s;h in multi|tudes, and more than half ob&s;cure my under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I find that, &s;ince we left Wenbourne-Hill,
<PB N="177" REF="183">
Frank has grown upon my thoughts very &s;trangely. Indeed till then I was but partially acquainted with his true character, the energy of which is very uncommon. But, though his virtues are become more con&s;picuous, the im|pediments that forbid any thought of union are not le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>My chief difficulty is, I do not yet know how to give full effect to my ar|guments, &s;o as to produce &s;uch convic|tion as he &s;hall be unable to re&s;i&s;t. Let me do but this, and I have no doubt of his perfect acquie&s;cence, and re&s;ignation. But, &s;hould I fail, the warfare of the pa&s;|&s;ions will be prolonged; and, for a time, a youth who&s;e worth is above my prai&s;e rendered unhappy. A &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice, committed by the per&s;on of whom, per|haps,
<PB N="178" REF="184">
he thought too highly to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that either error or pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould render her &s;o culpable, may prey upon his peace, and de&s;troy the felicity of one to whom rea&s;on and recollection tell me I cannot wi&s;h too much good.</P>
<P>I am convinced I have been guilty of another mi&s;take. I have on various oc|ca&s;ions been de&s;irous of expre&s;&s;ing ap|probation, mingled with e&s;teem and friend&s;hip. He has extorted it from me. He has obliged me to feel thus. And why, have I con&s;tantly a&s;ked my&s;elf, &s;hould I repre&s;s or conceal &s;en&s;ations that are the dues of merit? No: they ought not to have been repre&s;&s;ed, or concealed, but they ought to have been rendered intelligible, incapable of mi&s;|con&s;truction, and not liable to a meaning
<PB N="179" REF="185">
which they were never intended to con|vey. For, if ever they were more than I &s;uppo&s;e, I have indeed been guilty.</P>
<P>Yes, my Loui&s;a, let me di&s;charge my con&s;cience. Let no accu&s;ation of deceit re&s;t with me. I can endure any thing but &s;elf-reproach. I avow, therefore, Frank Henley is, in my e&s;timation, the mo&s;t de&s;erving man I have ever known. A man that I could love infinitely. A man who&s;e virtues I do and mu&s;t ever love. A man in who&s;e company my heart a&s;&s;ures me I could have enjoyed years of happine&s;s. If the ca&s;ui&s;ts in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;hould tell me this is what they mean by love, why then I am in love.</P>
<P>But if the being able, without a mur|mur, nay cheerfully, to marry another,
<PB N="180" REF="186">
or &s;ee him properly married, if the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the power and the re&s;olution to do what is right, and if an un&s;haken will to exert this power prove the contrary, why then I am not in love.</P>
<P>When I may, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on any duty, and with the full approbation of my own heart, yield up its entire af|fections, the man to whom they &s;hall be devoted &s;hall then find how much I can love.</P>
<P>My pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be, ought to be, and therefore &s;hall be, under my control; and, being con&s;cious of the purity of my own intentions, I have never thought that the emanations of mind ought to be &s;hackled by the dread of their being mi&s;|interpreted. It is not only cowardly, but in my opinion pernicious.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="187">
Yet, with re&s;pect to Frank, I fear this principle has led me into an error. Among other e&s;capes of this kind, there is one which has lately befallen me, and for which I doubt I am reprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>Frank has written a &s;ong, in which his feelings and &s;ituation are very &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed. He left it on my mu&s;ic de&s;k, by accident; for his character is too open, too determined, to &s;ubmit to arti|fice. The words plea&s;ed me, I may &s;ay affected me, &s;o very much that I was tempted to endeavour to adapt an air to them; which, when it was written, I &s;e|veral times repeated, and accompanied my&s;elf on the piano-forte. Your bro|ther came in ju&s;t as I had ended; and, from a hint which he purpo&s;ely gave, I
<PB N="182" REF="188">
&s;u&s;pect that Frank had been li&s;tening in the antichamber.</P>
<P>The behaviour of Frank afterward confirmed the &s;uppo&s;ition. He followed your brother, and &s;at down while we con|ver&s;ed. His whole &s;oul &s;eemed ab&s;orbed; but not, as I have &s;ometimes &s;een it, in melancholy. Satisfaction, plea&s;ure, I know not whether rapture would be too &s;trong a word for the expre&s;&s;ions which were di&s;coverable in his countenance.</P>
<P>My own mind had the moment before been impa&s;&s;ioned; and the &s;ame &s;en&s;a|tions thrilling as it were through my veins might mi&s;lead me, and induce me to &s;uppo&s;e things that had no exi&s;tence. Still I do not think I was mi&s;taken. And if not, what have I done? Have
<PB N="183" REF="189">
I not thoughtle&s;sly betrayed him into a belief that I mean to favour a pa&s;&s;ion which I &s;hould think it criminal to en|courage?</P>
<P>I know not why I delay &s;o long to ex|plain my &s;entiments. It is the weak fear of not doing ju&s;tice to my cau&s;e; of not convincing, and of making him un|happy, for whom I would &s;acrifice my life, every thing but principle, to make him the very rever&s;e.</P>
<P>However this mu&s;t and &s;hall &s;oon be ended. I do not pretend to fix a day, but it &s;hall not be a very di&s;tant one. I will arrange my thoughts, collect my whole force, and make an e&s;&s;ay which I am convinced cannot fail, unle&s;s by my fault. The ta&s;k is perhaps the mo&s;t &s;evere I have ever yet undertaken. I will
<PB N="184" REF="190">
remember this, and I hope my exertions will be adequate.</P>

It is teem|ing time therefore with every brain, that has either wit, folly, or fancy enough to contribute to the general fe&s;tivity. And various are their inventions, and &s;trata|gems, to excite &s;urpri&s;e, attract vi&s;itors, and keep up the holiday farce of the &s;cene. Mu&s;icians, painters, arti&s;ts, jug|glers, &s;ages, all who&s;e fame, no matter of what motley kind, has reached the public ear, and whom prai&s;e or pay can bring together, are a&s;&s;embled. Poets are invited to read their productions; and as reading well is no mean art, and writing well &s;till much more difficult, you may think what kind of an exhibi|tion
<PB N="191" REF="197">
your every day poeta&s;ters make. Yet, like a modern play, they are cer|tain of unbounded applau&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;t night we had a <HI>F&ecirc;te Champ&ecirc;tre;</HI> which, it mu&s;t be granted, was a mo&s;t accurate picture of nature, and the manners of ru&s;tics! The &s;implicity of the &s;hepherd life could not but be excel|lently repre&s;ented, by the ribbands, jewels, gauze, tiffany, and fringe, with which we were bedaubed; and the ra|gouts, frica&s;&s;ees, &s;pices, &s;auces, wines, and <HI>liqueurs,</HI> with which we were re|galed! Not to mention being &s;erved upon plate, by an army of footmen! But then, it was in the open air; and that was prodigiou&s;ly pa&s;toral!</P>
<P>When we were &s;ufficiently tired of eating and drinking, we all got up to
<PB N="192" REF="198">
dance; and the mild &s;plendour of the moon was utterly eclip&s;ed, by the glit|tering dazzle of &s;ome hundreds of lamps; red, green, yellow, and blue; the rainbow burle&s;qued; all mingled, in fanta&s;tic wreaths and forms, and &s;u&s;|pended among the foliage; that the trees might be as fine as our&s;elves! The invention, di&s;po&s;ition, and effect, how|ever, were highly applauded. And, &s;ince the evil was &s;mall and the mirth great, what could a man do, but &s;hake his ears, kick his heels, cut capers, laugh, &s;ing, &s;hout, &s;quall, and be as mad as the be&s;t?</P>
<P>To-morrow night we are to have fire|works; which will be no le&s;s rural. I was in a &s;plenetic humour, and indulged my&s;elf in an exclamation again&s;t &s;uch
<PB N="193" REF="199">
an abominable wa&s;te of gunpowder; for which I got reproved by my angelic monitre&s;s, who told me that, of all its u&s;es and abu&s;es, this was the mo&s;t inno|cent.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e our &s;tay here will not be le&s;s than a fortnight. But I have left orders for all letters to be &s;ent after me; &s;o that your heroic epi&s;tles will come &s;afe and &s;oon to hand.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Chateau de Villebrun.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the very warm en|treaties of our kind French friends, we have been hurried away from the me|tropolis &s;ooner than was intended. We are at pre&s;ent in the country, at the Cha|teau de Villebrun; where, if we are not merry, it is not for the want of laughing.
<PB N="195" REF="201">
Our feet and our tongues are never &s;till. We dance, talk, &s;ing, ride, &s;ail, or ra|ther paddle about in a &s;mall but roman|tic lake; in &s;hort we are never out of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Clifton is as active as the be&s;t, and is very expert in all feats of agility. With the French he &s;eems to dance for the ho|nour of his nation; and, with me, from a de&s;ire to prove that the man who makes preten&s;ions to me, which he now does openly enough, is capable of every excellence.</P>
<P>You know, Loui&s;a, how much I de|&s;pi&s;e the affectation of re&s;erve; but he is &s;o enterpri&s;ing a youth that I am &s;ome|times obliged, though very unwillingly, to exert a little mild authority.</P>
<P>The French, old or young, ugly or
<PB N="196" REF="202">
hand&s;ome, all are lovers; and are as liberal of their amorous &s;ighs, and ad|dre&s;&s;es, as if each were an Adonis. Clifton is well acquainted with foreign manners, or I can perceive their gal|lantry to me would make him half mad. As it is, he has been little le&s;s than rude, to one or two of the mo&s;t forward of my pretended admirers.</P>
<P>I &s;peak in the plural, as if we were ra|ther in town than at a country &s;eat; and &s;o we appear to be. The French nobility do not &s;eem to have any ta&s;te for &s;oli|tude. Their love of variety induces them to change the &s;cene; but the &s;ame tumult of gue&s;ts and vi&s;itors, coming and going, is every where their delight. Whatever can attract company they &s;eek with avidity. I am dear to them,
<PB N="197" REF="203">
becau&s;e I am an Engli&s;h beauty, as they tell me, and all the world is de&s;irous of paying its court to me.</P>
<P>Clifton has equal or perhaps greater merits of the &s;ame kind. And I a&s;&s;ure you, Loui&s;a, the women here can pay their court more artfully and almo&s;t as openly as the men.</P>
<P>Frank is idolized by them, becau&s;e he reads Shake&s;peare. You would won|der to hear the prai&s;es they be&s;tow upon him, and which indeed he richly de|&s;erves, though not one in ten of them under&s;tands a word he &s;ays. <HI>C'e&s;t beau! C'e&s;t magnifique! C'e&s;t &s;uperbe! C'e&s;t &s;ub|lime!</HI> Such is their continual round of good-natured &s;uperlatives, which they apply on all occa&s;ions, with a &s;incere de|&s;ire to make others as happy as they en|deavour
<PB N="198" REF="204">
to per&s;uade them&s;elves to be. Frank treats their gallantry with a kind of &s;ilent contempt, otherwi&s;e he would be a much greater favourite.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will be &s;urpri&s;ed to find me &s;till guilty of procra&s;tination, and to hear me de&s;cribing French manners, in&s;tead of the mode in which I addre&s;&s;ed a youth whom I have accu&s;ed my&s;elf of having, in a certain &s;en&s;e, mi&s;led, and kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. I can only an&s;wer that my intentions have been fru&s;trated; chiefly indeed by this country excur&s;ion, though in part by other accidents. My mind has not indulged it&s;elf in indo|lence; it could not; it is too deeply in|tere&s;ted. But, the more I have thought, the more have I been confirmed in my former opinion. This is the hour of
<PB N="199" REF="205">
trial: this is the time to prove I have &s;ome real claims to that &s;uperiority which I have been &s;o ready to flatter my&s;elf I po&s;&s;e&s;s. Were there nothing to regret, nay were there not &s;omething to &s;uffer, where would be the merit of victory?&mdash;But, on the other hand, how much is there to gain!&mdash;A mind of the fir&s;t order to be retrieved!&mdash;A Clifton!&mdash;A brother of Loui&s;a!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>This appears to be a &s;erious cri&s;is. Again I mu&s;t repeat how much I am afraid of being hurried forward too fa&s;t. An error at this moment might be fatal. Clifton is &s;o much alarmed by the par|ticular re&s;pect which the Count de Beau|noir [A plea&s;ant kind of madman, who
<PB N="200" REF="206">
is a vi&s;itant here.] pays me, that he has this in&s;tant been with me, confe&s;&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion for me, in all the &s;trong and perhaps extravagant language which cu&s;tom has &s;eemed t authori&s;e, and has entreated, with a degree of warmth and earne&s;tne&s;s that could &s;carcely be re&s;i&s;t|ed, my permi&s;&s;ion to mention the matter immediately to Sir Arthur.</P>
<P>It became me to &s;peak without di&s;|gui&s;e. I told him I was far from in&s;en|&s;ible of his merits; that a union with the brother of my Loui&s;a, if propriety, duty, and affection &s;hould happen to combine, would be the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart; that I &s;hould con&s;ider any affec|tation and coyne&s;s as criminal; but that I was not entirely free from doubt; and, before I could agree to the propo&s;al be|ing
<PB N="201" REF="207">
made to Sir Arthur, I thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary we &s;hould mutually compare our thoughts, and &s;crutinize as it were each other to the very &s;oul; that we might not act ra&s;hly, in the mo&s;t &s;erious of all the private events of life.&mdash;You know my heart, Loui&s;a; at lea&s;t as well as I my&s;elf know it; and I am fearful of being precipitate.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed rather di&s;appointed, and was impatient to begin the conver&s;ation I wi&s;hed for immediately.</P>
<P>I told him I was unprepared; my thoughts were not &s;ufficiently collected; and that the hurry in which we at pre|&s;ent exi&s;t would &s;carcely allow me time to perform &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a duty. But, that I might avoid the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of coquetry, if it were his de&s;ire, I would
<PB N="202" REF="208">
&s;hut my&s;elf up for a day from company, and examine whether there were any real impediments; that I would a&s;k my&s;elf what my hopes and expectations were; and that I reque&s;ted, or indeed expect|ed that he &s;hould do the &s;ame. I added however that, if he plea&s;ed, it would be much more agreeable to me to defer this &s;erious ta&s;k, at lea&s;t till we &s;hould return to Paris.</P>
<P>He repeated my words, if it would be much more agreeable to me, impatient and unea&s;y though he owned he was, he mu&s;t &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered I required no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, except to rea&s;on; to which I hoped both he and I &s;hould always be &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Love, he replied, was &s;o di&s;dainful of re&s;traint that it would not acknowledge
<PB N="203" REF="209">
the control of rea&s;on it&s;elf. However, by repre&s;enting to him how particular our mutual ab&s;ence from the company would &s;eem, unle&s;s we could conde&s;cend to tell &s;ome fal&s;ehood, which I would not I &s;aid &s;uppo&s;e po&s;&s;ible to either of us, I prevailed on him to &s;ub&s;cribe to this &s;hort delay.</P>
<P>His pa&s;&s;ions and feelings are &s;trong. One minute he &s;eemed affected by the approbation which, as far as I could with truth, I did not &s;cruple to be&s;tow on his many &s;uperior gifts; and the next to conceive &s;ome chagrin that I &s;hould for a moment he&s;itate. The no|ble&s;t natures, Loui&s;a, are the mo&s;t &s;ub|ject to pride, can the lea&s;t endure neg|lect, and are apte&s;t to con&s;true what|ever
<PB N="204" REF="210">
is not directly affirmative in their favour into inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Count de Beau|noir, he has been more pa&s;&s;ionate, in expre&s;&s;ing how much he admires me, than my re&s;erve to him can have autho|ri&s;ed; except &s;o far as he follows the manners of his country, and the impul&s;e of his peculiar character. I &s;uppo&s;e he means little; though he has &s;aid much. Not that I am certain. He may be more in earne&s;t than I de&s;ire; but I hope he is not; becau&s;e, if I am to be your &s;i&s;ter as well as your friend, I &s;hould be &s;orry that any thing &s;hould excite a &s;ha|dow of doubt in the mind of Clifton.</P>
<P>The Count is one of the Proven&ccedil;al nobility; a whim&s;ical creature, with an
<PB N="205" REF="211">
imagination amazingly rapid, but ex|travagant. Your brother calls him Count Shatter-brain; and I tell him that he forgets he has &s;ome claim to the title him&s;elf. The Count has read the old Proven&ccedil;al poets, and romance wri|ters, till he has made him&s;elf a kind of Don Quixote; except that he has none of the Don's delightful &s;y&s;tematic gra|vity. The Count on the contrary amu&s;es by his want of &s;y&s;tem, and his quick, changeable incongruity. He is in rap|tures one moment with what he laughs at the next. Were it not for the mad follies of jealou&s;y, again&s;t which we can|not be too guarded, the manner in which he addre&s;&s;es, or in his own language adores me, would be plea&s;ant. If I
<PB N="206" REF="212">
wi&s;hed to pa&s;s my life in laughing, I would certainly marry the Count.</P>
<P>I am called to dinner. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Chateau de Villebrus.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY alarms, Loui&s;a, increa&s;e; and with them my anxious wi&s;hes for an eclairci&s;&s;ement with Frank. Clifton has too &s;trongly imbibed high but fal&s;e notions of honour and revenge. His quick, apt, and ver&s;atile talents are in|dubitable. He wants nothing but the
<PB N="208" REF="214">
power to curb and regulate his pa&s;&s;ions, to render him all that his generous and excellent &s;i&s;ter could de&s;ire. But at pre|&s;ent his &s;en&s;ibility is too great. He &s;carcely can brook the &s;lighte&s;t tokens of di&s;approbation. He is rather too firmly per&s;uaded that he de&s;erves ap|plau&s;e, and admiration; and that re|proof he &s;carcely can de&s;erve: or, if he did, to &s;ubmit to it he imagines would be di&s;honourable.</P>
<P>Frank and he behave more than u&s;u|ally cool to each other: I know not why, unle&s;s it has been occa&s;ioned by an incident which happened ye&s;terday. Clifton has bought an Engli&s;h hunter, from one of his countrymen at Paris, which he was exhibiting to his French friends, who&s;e hor&s;eman&s;hip is very dif|ferent
<PB N="209" REF="215">
from ours, and who were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him ride &s;o fearle&s;ly over gates and other impediments. They conti|nued their airing in the park of Ville|brun, and turned round to a kind of haha, which was both deep and wide, and about half full of water, by the &s;ide of which they &s;aw a party of ladies &s;tand|ing, and me among the re&s;t. Frank was with us.</P>
<P>One of the gentlemen a&s;ked whether the hor&s;e could leap over the haha: to which Clifton made no an&s;wer, but im|mediately clapped &s;purs to his hunter, and over he flew. The whole company, gentlemen and ladies, broke out into exclamations of &s;urpri&s;e; and Clifton turned his hor&s;e's head round, and re|gained his former place.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="216">
While they were wondering, Frank Henley happened to make it a matter of doubt whether a man or a hor&s;e could leap the farthe&s;t; and Clifton, continu|ally in the habit of contending with Frank, &s;aid it was ridiculous to &s;tart &s;uch an argument, unle&s;s he would fir&s;t &s;hew that he him&s;elf could make the &s;ame leap. Frank, piqued in his turn, retired a few yards; and, without pulling off his coat or deigning to leap, he made a &s;hort run and a hop and &s;prung over.</P>
<P>You may imagine that the kind and good folks, who love to be a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;till more to tell the greatne&s;s of their a&s;toni&s;hment, were manifold in their interjections. Frank, in order to rejoin the company, was obliged a &s;econd time to cro&s;s the haha; which he did with
<PB N="211" REF="217">
the &s;ame &s;afety and truly amazing agi|lity as he had done before.</P>
<P>Clifton, indulging his wrong habits, though I have no doubt admiring Frank as much as the re&s;t, told him in a kind of &s;arca&s;tic banter that, though he could not prove the equality of mankind, he had at lea&s;t proved him&s;elf equal to a hor&s;e. To which Frank replied he was mi&s;taken; for that he had &s;hewn him|&s;elf equal to the hor&s;e and his rider.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer I fear dwells upon the mind of Clifton; and I &s;carcely my&s;elf can tell whether it were or were not worthy of Frank. How can Clifton be wilfully blind to &s;uch courage, rectitude of heart, under&s;tanding and genius?</P>
<P>The &s;tern unrelenting fortitude of Frank, in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, and &s;ome
<PB N="212" REF="218">
fymptoms of violence in the impetuous Clifton, have in&s;pired me with appre|hen&s;ions; and have induced me to be|have with more re&s;erve and coldne&s;s to Frank than I ever before a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>Yet, Loui&s;a, my heart is wrung to &s;ee the effect it produces. He has a mind of &s;uch di&s;criminating power, &s;uch magnanimity, that an injury to it is a deep, a double &s;in; and every look, eve|ry action te&s;tify that he thinks him&s;elf injured, by the di&s;tance with which I behave. Oh that he him&s;elf might be impelled to begin the &s;ubject with which my mind is labouring!</P>
<P>This is wrong; I am a&s;hamed of my own cowardice. Yet would there not be &s;omething terrifying in a formal ap|pointment, to tell him what it &s;eems
<PB N="213" REF="219">
mu&s;t be told?&mdash;Yes, Loui&s;a, mu&s;t&mdash;And is there not danger he &s;hould think me &s;evere; nay unju&s;t?&mdash;Would it were over!&mdash;I hope he will not think &s;o of me!&mdash;It mu&s;t be done!&mdash;Mu&s;t!&mdash;Mu&s;t!&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, Loui&s;a, I could be a very woman&mdash;But I will not!&mdash;No, no!&mdash;It is pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;I have put my hand|kerchief to my eyes and it is gone&mdash;I have repre&s;&s;ed an ob&s;tinate heaving of the heart&mdash;</P>
<P>Let her blame me, if I de&s;erve it, but my Loui&s;a mu&s;t &s;ee me as I am&mdash;Yet I will conquer&mdash;Be &s;ure I will&mdash;But I mu&s;t not &s;ing his &s;ong any more!</P>

<P>The ability to di&s;cover his merit im|plies merit in her&s;elf, and the mu&s;ician and lady were equally enamoured of each other. A plan for elopement con|&s;equently was laid, and put in exe|cution; but not effectually, for, before the lovers had pa&s;&s;ed the confines of the kingdom, they were pur&s;ued and overtaken.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ician knew his own per&s;onal danger, and by a &s;tratagem fortunately e&s;caped from his bonds, and attained a place of &s;afety. The lady was brought back; and, from the &s;everity of the French laws and the &s;uppo&s;ed atrocity
<PB N="223" REF="229">
of the crime, it is generally affirmed that the mu&s;ician, notwith&s;tanding his talents and fame, had he been &s;ecured, would have been executed.</P>
<P>I have mentioned this adventure, my dear Loui&s;a, not &s;o much for it's own &s;ake as for what relates to my&s;elf. It was natural that I &s;hould feel compa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;takes, if mi&s;takes they be, which have &s;o great an affinity to virtue; and that I &s;hould plead for the lovers, and again&s;t the barbarity of laws &s;o unju&s;t and inhuman. For it is certain that, had not the mu&s;ician been put to death, his lea&s;t puni&s;hment would have been perpetual impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>In a former letter I mentioned the increa&s;ing alarms of Sir Arthur; and
<PB N="224" REF="230">
this was a fit opportunity for him to &s;hew how very &s;erious and great tho&s;e alarms are. He oppo&s;ed me, while I argued in behalf of the lovers, with what might in him be called violence; af|firmed it was a crime for which no merit or genius could compen&s;ate; highly ap|plauded tho&s;e whole&s;ome laws that pre|vented &s;uch crimes, and pre&s;erved the honour of noble families from attaint; la|mented the want of &s;imilar laws in Eng|land; and &s;poke of the conduct of the young lady with a degree of bitterne&s;s which from him was unu&s;ual. In fine, the &s;pi|rit of his whole di&s;cour&s;e was evidently to warm me, and explicitly to declare what his opinions on this &s;ubject are.</P>
<P>Had I before wanted conviction, he
<PB N="225" REF="231">
fully convinced me, on this occa&s;ion, of the impo&s;&s;ibility of any union between me and Frank Henley; at lea&s;t without &s;acrificing the felicity of my father and my family, and from being generally and &s;incerely beloved by them, render|ing my&s;elf the object of eternal reproach, and almo&s;t of hatred.</P>
<P>Previous to this conver&s;ation, I was unea&s;y at the &s;tate of my own mind, and particularly at what I &s;uppo&s;e to be the &s;tate of Mr. Henley's; and this unea&s;i|ne&s;s is at pre&s;ent very much increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Once again, Loui&s;a, it mu&s;t immedi|ately have an end. I can &s;upport it no longer. I mu&s;t be firm. My half-&s;tag|gering re&s;olution is now fixed. I cannot, mu&s;t not doubt. My father and family
<PB N="226" REF="232">
mu&s;t not be &s;acrificed to &s;peculative probabilities. Frank is the mo&s;t de|&s;erving of mankind; and that it &s;hould be a duty to reject the mo&s;t de&s;erving of mankind, as the friend of my life, my better &s;elf, my hu&s;band, is &s;trange; but I am neverthele&s;s convinced that a duty it is. Yes; the conflicts of doubt are over. I mu&s;t and will per&s;evere.</P>
<P>Poor Frank! To be guilty of inju&s;tice to a nature &s;o noble, to wring a heart &s;o generous, and to neglect de&s;ert &s;o un|equalled, is indeed a killing thought! But the &s;tern the unrelenting dictates of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be obeyed. The neglect the inju&s;tice and the cruelty are the world's, not mine: my heart di&s;avows them, revolts at them, dete&s;ts them!</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="233">
Heaven ble&s;s my Loui&s;a, and give her &s;uperior prudence to guard and pre|&s;erve her from the&s;e too &s;trong &s;u&s;cepti|bilities! May the angel of fortitude never for&s;ake her, as &s;he &s;eems half in|clined to do her poor</P>
