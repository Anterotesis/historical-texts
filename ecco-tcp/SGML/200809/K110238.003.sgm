<P>AT la&s;t, my dear Loui&s;a, the charm is broken: the &s;pell of &s;ilence is di&s;|&s;olved. Incapable any longer of re|&s;traint, pa&s;&s;ion has bur&s;t its bounds, and &s;trong though the conte&s;t was, victory has declared for rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
My change of behaviour has produced this effect. Not that I applaud my&s;elf: on the contrary, I am far from plea&s;ed with my own want of fortitude. I have even a&s;&s;umed an au&s;terity which I did not feel.</P>
<P>I do not mean to &s;ay that all appear|ances, relative to my&s;elf, were fal&s;e. No. I was unea&s;y; de&s;irous to &s;peak, de&s;irous that he &s;hould &s;peak, and could accompli&s;h neither. I accu&s;ed my&s;elf of having given hopes that were &s;eductive, and wi&s;hed to retract. In &s;hort, I have not been altogether &s;o con&s;i&s;tent as I ought to be; as my letters to you, my friend, will witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Various little incidents preceded and indeed helped to produce this &s;well and overflow of the heart, and the eclair|ci&s;&s;ement
<PB N="3" REF="5">
that followed. In the morn|ing at breakfa&s;t, Frank took the cakes I u&s;ually eat to hand to me; and Clifton, who&s;e watchful &s;pirit is ever alert, caught up a plate of bread and butter, to offer me at the &s;ame in&s;tant. His looks &s;hewed he expected the preference. I was &s;orry for it, and pau&s;ed for a moment. At la&s;t the principle of not encouraging Frank prevailed, and I took &s;ome bread and butter from Clifton. It was a repe|tition of &s;lights, which Frank had lately met with, and he felt it; yet he bowed with a tolerable grace, and put down his plate.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after quitted the room, but returned unperceived by me.</P>
<P>The young marchione&s;s had break|fa&s;ted, and retired to her toilet; where
<PB N="4" REF="6">
&s;ome of the gentlemen were attending her. She had left a &s;nuff-box of con&s;i|derable value with me, which I had for|gotten to return; and, with that kind of &s;portive cheerfulne&s;s which I rather en|courage than repre&s;s, I called&mdash;<Q>Here! Where are all my e&s;quires? I want a me&s;&s;enger.</Q></P>
<P>Clifton heard me, and Frank was unexpectedly at my elbow. Had I known it, I &s;hould not have &s;poken &s;o thoughtle&s;sly. Frank came forward and bowed. Clifton called&mdash;<Q>Here am I, ready, fair lady, to execute your be|he&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>I was a &s;econd time embarra&s;&s;ed. After a &s;hort he&s;itation, I &s;aid&mdash;<Q>No&mdash;I have changed my mind.</Q></P>
<P>Frank retired; but Clifton advanced,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
with his u&s;ual gaiety, an&s;wering,&mdash;<Q>Nay, nay! I have not earned half a crown yet this morning, and I mu&s;t not be cheated of my fare.</Q> I would &s;till have refu&s;ed, but I perceived Clifton be|gan to look &s;erious, and I &s;aid to him&mdash;<Q>Well, well, good man, here then, take this &s;nuff-box to the marchione&s;s, &s;he may want it: but do not blunder, and break it; for if you do I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s you my &s;ervice. Recollect the picture in the lid, &s;et with dia|monds!</Q></P>
<P>It was fated to be a day of mortifica|tion to Frank. His complai&s;ance had induced him to comply with the reque&s;t of the marchione&s;s, that he would read one of the mad &s;cenes in Lear, though he knew &s;he had not the lea&s;t acquaint|ance
<PB N="6" REF="8">
with the Engli&s;h language. But &s;he wanted amu&s;ement, and was plea&s;ed to mark the progre&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ions; which I never &s;aw &s;o di&s;tinctly and highly expre&s;&s;ed as in his countenance, when he reads Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>I happened to come into her apart|ment, for the French are delightfully ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and the reading was in|&s;tantly interrupted. I was the very per|&s;on &s;he wanted to &s;ee. How &s;hould we &s;pend the evening? The country was horribly dull! There had been no new vi&s;itors the&s;e two days! Should we have a dance? I gave my a&s;&s;ent, and away &s;he ran to tell every body.</P>
<P>I followed; Frank came after me, and with &s;ome reluctance, foreboding a repul&s;e, a&s;ked whether he &s;hould have
<PB N="7" REF="9">
the plea&s;ure to dance with me. His manner and the foregone circum&s;tances made me gue&s;s his que&s;tion before he &s;poke. <Q>My an&s;wer was&mdash;I have ju&s;t made a promi&s;e to my&s;elf that I will dance with Mr. Clifton.</Q> It was true: the thought had pa&s;&s;ed through my mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton, madam!</P>
<P>Yes&mdash;</P>
<P>You&mdash;you&mdash;</P>
<P>I have not &s;een Mr. Clifton? Right&mdash;But I &s;aid I had made the promi&s;e to <HI>my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Poor Frank could contain no longer! I &s;ee, madam, &s;aid he, I am de&s;pi&s;ed; and I de&s;erve contempt; I crouch to it, I invite it, and have obtained a full por|tion of it&mdash;Yet why?&mdash;What have I
<PB N="8" REF="10">
done?&mdash;Why is this &s;udden change?&mdash;The fal&s;e glitter that deceives mankind then is irre&s;i&s;tible!&mdash;But &s;urely, ma|dam, ju&s;tice is as much my due as if my name were Clifton. Spurn me, trample on me, when I &s;ully my&s;elf by vice and infamy! But till then I &s;hould once have hoped to have e&s;caped being hum|bled in the du&s;t, by one whom I regarded as the mo&s;t benignant, as well as the mo&s;t de&s;erving and equitable of earthly creatures!</P>
<P>This is indeed a heavy charge: and I am afraid much of it is too true. Here is company coming. I am &s;orry I can|not an&s;wer it immediately.</P>
<P>I can &s;uffer any thing rather than exi&s;t under my pre&s;ent tortures. Will you favour me &s;o far, madam, as to grant me half an hour's hearing?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
Willingly. It is what I wi&s;h. Come to my apartment after dinner.</P>
<P>Clifton came up, and I have no doubt read in our countenances that &s;omething more than common had pa&s;&s;ed. Indeed I perceived it, or thought &s;o; but his ima|gination took another turn, in con&s;e|quence of my informing him, that I had been ju&s;t telling Frank I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf to be his (Clifton's) partner. He thanked me, his countenance &s;hewed it as well as his words, for my kindne&s;s. He was coming, he &s;aid, to petition, the in&s;tant he had heard of the dance. But &s;till he looked at Frank, as if he thought it &s;trange that I &s;hould conde&s;cend to account to him for my thoughts and pro|mi&s;es.</P>
<P>Dinner time came, and we &s;at down
<PB N="10" REF="12">
to table. But the mind is &s;ometimes too bu&s;y to attend to the appetites. I and Frank ate but little. He ro&s;e fir&s;t from table, that he might not &s;eem to follow me. His delicacy never &s;lumbers. I took the fir&s;t opportunity to retire. Frank was pre&s;ently with me, and our dialogue began. The &s;truggle of the feelings ordained that I &s;hould be the fir&s;t &s;peaker.</P>
<P>I have been thinking very &s;eriou&s;ly, Frank, of what you &s;aid to me this morning.</P>
<P>Would to heaven you could forget it, madam!</P>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
<P>I was unju&s;t! A madman! A vain fool! An idiot!&mdash;Pardon this rude ve|hemence, but I cannot forgive my&s;elf
<PB N="11" REF="13">
for having been &s;o ready to accu&s;e one whom&mdash;! I cannot &s;peak my feelings!&mdash;I have de&s;erted my&s;elf!&mdash;I am no longer the creature of rea&s;on, but the child of pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;My mind is all tumult, all in|congruity!</P>
<P>You wrong your&s;elf. The error has been mutual, or rather I have been much the mo&s;t to blame. I am very &s;en&s;ible of, and indeed very &s;orry for my mi&s;take&mdash;Indeed I am&mdash;I per|ceived you indulging hopes that cannot be realized, and&mdash;</P>
<P>Cannot, madam?</P>
<P>Never!&mdash;I can &s;ee you think your&s;elf de&s;pi&s;ed; but you do your&s;elf great wrong.</P>
<P>My mind is &s;o di&s;turbed, by the abrupt and ab&s;urd folly with which I
<PB N="12" REF="14">
accu&s;ed you, unheard, this morning, that it is le&s;s now in a &s;tate to do my cau&s;e ju&s;tice than at any other time&mdash;Still I will be a man&mdash;Your word, ma|dam, was&mdash;Cannot!&mdash;</P>
<P>It was.</P>
<P>Permit me to a&s;k, is it per&s;on&mdash;?</P>
<P>No&mdash;certainly not. Per&s;on would with me be always a di&s;tant con&s;ider|ation. [You, Loui&s;a, know how very far from exceptionable the per&s;on of Frank is, if that were any part of the que&s;tion.]</P>
<P>You are no flatterer, madam, and you have thought proper occa&s;ionally to ex|pre&s;s your approbation of my morals and mind.</P>
<P>Yet my expre&s;&s;ions have never equal|led my feelings!&mdash;Never!</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
Then, madam, where is the impo&s;&s;i|bility? In what does it con&s;i&s;t? The world may think meanly of me, for the want of what I my&s;elf hold in contempt: but &s;urely you cannot join in the world's inju&s;tice?</P>
<P>I cannot think meanly of you.</P>
<P>I have no titles. I am what pride calls nobody: the &s;on of a man who came pennyle&s;s into the &s;ervice of your family; in which to my infinite grief he has grown rich. I would rather &s;tarve than acquire opulence by the efforts of cun|ning, flattery, and avarice; and if I blu&s;h for any thing, relative to family, it is for that. I am either above or below the wi&s;h of being what is in&s;olently called well born.</P>
<P>You confound, or rather you do not &s;eparate, two things which are very di&s;|tinct;
<PB N="14" REF="16">
that which I think of you, and that which the world would think of me, were I to encourage hopes which you would have me indulge.</P>
<P>Your actions, madam, &s;hew how much and how properly you di&s;regard the world's opinion.</P>
<P>But I do not di&s;regard the effects which that opinion may have, upon the happine&s;s of my father, my family, my|&s;elf, and my hu&s;band, if ever I &s;hould marry.</P>
<P>If truth and ju&s;tice require it, ma|dam, even all the&s;e ought to be di&s;re|garded.</P>
<P>Indubitably.</P>
<P>Did I know a man, upon the face of the earth, who had a &s;till deeper &s;en&s;e of your high qualities and virtues than I
<PB N="15" REF="17">
have, who under&s;tood them more inti|mately, would &s;tudy them, emulate them more, and profit better by them, I have con|fidence enough in my&s;elf to &s;ay I would re&s;ign you without repining. But, when I think on the union between mind and mind&mdash;the aggregate&mdash;! I want language, madam&mdash;!</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you.</P>
<P>When I reflect on the wondrous happine&s;s we might enjoy, while mutu|ally exerting our&s;elves in the general cau&s;e of virtue, I confe&s;s the thought of renouncing &s;o much bli&s;s, or rather &s;uch a duty to my&s;elf and the world, is excru|ciating torture.</P>
<P>Your idea of living for the cau&s;e of virtue delights me; it is in full concord with my own. But whether that great
<PB N="16" REF="18">
cau&s;e would be&s;t be promoted by our union, or not, is a que&s;tion which we are incapable of determining: though I think probabilities are for the negative. Facts and ob&s;ervation have given me rea&s;on to believe that the too ea&s;y grati|fication of our de&s;ires is pernicious to mind; and that it acquires vigour and ela&s;ticity from oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>And would you then upon principle, madam, marry a man whom you mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e?</P>
<P>No, not de&s;pi&s;e. If indeed I were all I could wi&s;h to be, I am per&s;uaded I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e no one. I &s;hould endea|vour to in&s;truct the ignorant, and re|form the erroneous. However, I will tell you what &s;ort of a man I &s;hould wi&s;h to marry. Fir&s;t he mu&s;t be a per|&s;on
<PB N="17" REF="19">
of whom no prejudice, no mi&s;take of any kind, &s;hould induce the world, that is, the per&s;ons neare&s;t and mo&s;t connected with me in the world, to think meanly&mdash;Shall I be cited by the thoughtle&s;s, the &s;imple, and the perver&s;e, in ju&s;tification of their own improper conduct?&mdash;You cannot wi&s;h it, Frank!&mdash;Nor is this the mo&s;t alarming fear&mdash;My friends!&mdash;My relations!&mdash;My father!&mdash;To incur a father's reproach for having di&s;honoured his family were fearful: but to meet, to merit, to live under his cur&s;e!&mdash;God of heaven forbid!</P>
<P>Mu&s;t we then never dare to counteract mi&s;take? Mu&s;t mind, though enlighten|ed by truth, &s;ubmit to be the eternal &s;lave of error?&mdash;What is there that is thus dreadful, madam, in the cur&s;e of
<PB N="18" REF="20">
prejudice? Have not the greate&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind been cur&s;ed by ignorance?</P>
<P>It is not the cur&s;e it&s;elf that is terri|ble, but the torture of the per&s;on's mind by whom it is uttered!&mdash;Nor is it the torture of a minute, or a day, but of years!&mdash;His child, his beloved child, on whom his hopes and heart were fixed, to whom he looked for all the bli&s;s of filial obedience, all the energies of virtue, and all the effu&s;ions of affec|tion, to &s;ee him&s;elf de&s;erted by her, un|feelingly de&s;erted, plunged in &s;orrows unutterable, eternally di&s;honoured, the index and the bye-word of &s;candal, &s;coffed at for the fault of her whom his fond and fatherly reveries had painted faultle&s;s, whi&s;pered out of &s;ociety be|cau&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="21">
of the &s;hame of her in whom he gloried, and I this child!</P>
<P>Were the conflict what your imagina|tion has figured it, madam, your terrors would be ju&s;t&mdash;But I have thought deeply on it, and know that your very virtues mi&s;guide you. It would not be torture, nor would it be eternal&mdash;On the contrary, madam, I, poor as I am in the e&s;teem of an arrogant world, I proudly affirm it would be the le&s;s and not the greater evil.</P>
<P>You mi&s;take!&mdash;Indeed, Frank, you mi&s;take!&mdash;The fear of poverty, the &s;neers of the world, ignominy it&s;elf, were the pain inflicted but confined to me, I would de&s;pi&s;e. But to &s;tretch my father upon the rack, and with him every creature that loves me, even you
<PB N="20" REF="22">
your&s;elf!&mdash;It mu&s;t not be!&mdash;It mu&s;t not be!</P>
<P>I too fatally perceive, madam, your mind is &s;ubjected by the&s;e phantoms of fear.</P>
<P>No, no&mdash;not phantoms; real exi&s;t|ences; the palpable beings of rea&s;on!&mdash;Be&s;ide what influence have I in the world, except over my friends and fa|mily? And &s;hall I renounce this little influence, this only power of doing good, in order to gratify my own pa&s;|&s;ions, by making my&s;elf the outca&s;t of that family and of that world to whom it is my ambition to live an exam|ple?&mdash;My family and the world are prejudiced and unju&s;t: I know it. But where is the remedy? Can we work mi|racles? Will their prejudices vani&s;h at
<PB N="21" REF="23">
our bidding?&mdash;I have already mortally offended the mo&s;t powerful of my rela|tions, Lord Fitz-Allen, by refu&s;ing a fooli&s;h peer of his recommendation. He is my maternal uncle; proud, preju|diced, and unforgiving. Previous to this refu&s;al I was the only per&s;on in our family whom he conde&s;cended to notice. He prophe&s;ied, in the &s;pleen of pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould &s;oon bring &s;hame on my fa|mily; and I as boldly retorted I would never di&s;honour the name of St. Ives&mdash;I &s;poke in their own idiom, and meant to be &s;o under&s;tood&mdash;Recollect all this!&mdash;Be firm, be ju&s;t to your&s;elf and me!&mdash;Indeed indeed, Frank, it is not my heart that refu&s;es you; it is my under&s;tanding; it is principle; it is a determination not to do that which my
<PB N="22" REF="24">
rea&s;on cannot ju&s;tify&mdash;Join with me, Frank&mdash;Re&s;olve&mdash;Give me your hand&mdash;Let us di&s;dain to &s;et mankind an example which would indeed be a virtuous and a good one, were all the conditions under&s;tood; but which, under the appearances it would a&s;&s;ume, would be criminal in the extreme.</P>
<P>My hand and heart, madam, are ever|la&s;tingly yours: and it is becau&s;e this heart yearns to &s;et the world an example, higher infinitely than that which you propo&s;e, that thus I plead!&mdash;This op|portunity is my fir&s;t and la&s;t&mdash;I read my doom&mdash;Bear with me therefore while I declare my &s;en&s;ations and my thoughts.&mdash;The pa&s;&s;ion I feel is as unlike what is u&s;ually meant by love as day to night, grace to deformity, or truth to fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">
It is not your fine form, madam, &s;u|premely beautiful though you are, which I love. At lea&s;t I love it only as an excellent part of a divine whole. It is your other, your better, your more hea|venly &s;elf, to which I have dared to a&s;pire. I claim relation&s;hip to your mind; and again declare I think my claims have a right, which none of the fal&s;e di&s;tinc|tions of men can &s;uper&s;ede. Think then, madam, again I conjure you, think ere you decide.&mdash;If the union of two people who&s;e pure love, founded on an unerring conviction of mutual worth, might promi&s;e the reality of that heaven of which the world delights to dream; who&s;e &s;ouls, both burning with the &s;ame ardour to attain and to diffu&s;e excel|lence, would mingle and act with ince&s;|&s;ant
<PB N="24" REF="26">
energy, who, having ri&s;en &s;uperior to the mi&s;takes of mankind, would diffe|minate the &s;ame &s;pirit of truth, the &s;ame internal peace, the &s;ame happine&s;s, the &s;ame virtues which they them&s;elves po&s;|&s;e&s;s among thou&s;ands; who would ad|mire, animate, emulate each other; who&s;e wi&s;hes, efforts, and principles would all combine to one great end, the general good; who, being de&s;irous only to di&s;pen&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, could not fail to enjoy; if a union like this be not &s;trictly conformable to the laws of eter|nal truth, or if there be any arguments, any perils, any terrors which ought to annul &s;uch a union, I confe&s;s that the arguments, the perils, the terrors, and eternal truth it&s;elf are equally unknown to me.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
We pau&s;ed for a moment. The beauty, force, and grandeur of the pic|ture he had drawn &s;taggered me. Yet it was but a repetition of what had fre|quently pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my mind, in colours almo&s;t as vivid as tho&s;e with which he painted. I had but one an|&s;wer, and replied&mdash;</P>
<P>The world!&mdash;My family!&mdash;My fa|ther!&mdash;I cannot encounter the male|diction of a father!&mdash;What!

<P>Again we pau&s;ed&mdash;He perceived my
<PB N="26" REF="28">
terrors were too violent to cede to any efforts of &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;on. His counte|nance changed; the energy of argument di&s;appeared, and was &s;ucceeded by all the tenderne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion. The deci&s;ive moment, the moment of trial was come. His features &s;oftened into that form which never yet failed to melt the heart, and he thus continued.</P>
<P>To the &s;corn of vice, the &s;coffs of ig|norance, the u&s;urpations of the pre&s;um|ing, and the contumelies of the proud, I have patiently &s;ubmitted: but to find my great and as I thought infallible &s;up|port wre&s;ted from me; to perceive that divine e&s;&s;ence which I imagined too much a part of my&s;elf to do me wrong, overlooking me; rejecting me; dead to tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations which I thought mutu|ally

do I wi&s;h you! Oh that I had prayers potent enough to draw down ble&s;&s;ings on you!&mdash;Love you?&mdash;Yes!&mdash;The very idea bur&s;ts into pa&s;&s;ion. [The tears, Loui&s;a, were &s;treaming down my cheeks.] Why &s;hould you doubt of all the affection which virtue can be&s;tow? Do you not de&s;erve it?&mdash;Oh yes!&mdash;Love you in the manner you could wi&s;h I mu&s;t not, dare not, ought not: but, as I ought, I love you infinitely! Ay, dear, dear Frank, as I ought, infinitely!</P>
<P>Loui&s;a!&mdash;Blame me if thou wilt&mdash;But I ki&s;&s;ed him!&mdash;The cha&s;tity of my thoughts defied mi&s;con&s;truction, and the purity of the will &s;anctified the extrava|gance of the act. A daring enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;eized me. I beheld his pa&s;&s;ions &s;trug|gling
<PB N="30" REF="32">
to attain the very pinnacle of ex|cellence. I wi&s;hed to confirm the no|ble emulation, to convince him how dif|ferent the pure love of mind might be from the meaner love of pa&s;&s;ion, and I ki&s;&s;ed him! I find my affections, my &s;en&s;ibilities, peculiarly liable to the&s;e &s;trong &s;allies. Perhaps all minds of a certain texture are &s;ubject to &s;uch rapid and almo&s;t re&s;i&s;tle&s;s emotions; and whe|ther they ought to be encouraged or counteracted I have not yet di&s;covered. But the circum&s;tance, unexpected and &s;trange as it was, &s;uffered no wrong in|terpretation in the dignified &s;oul of Frank. With all the ardour of affec|tion, but cha&s;tened by every token of delicacy, he cla&s;ped me in his arms, re|turned
<PB N="31" REF="33">
my ki&s;s, then &s;unk down on one knee, and exclaimed&mdash;Now let me die&mdash;</P>
<P>After a moment's pau&s;e, I an&s;wered&mdash;No, Frank! Live! Live to be a ble&s;|&s;ing to the world, and an honour to the human race!</P>
<P>I took a turn to the window, and after having calmed the too much of feeling which I had &s;uffered to grow upon me, I continued the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I hope, Frank, we now under&s;tand each other; and that, as this is the fir&s;t, &s;o it will be the la&s;t contention of the pa&s;&s;ions in which we &s;hall indulge our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Madam, though <HI>I &s;till think, nay feel a certainty of conviction, that you act from mi&s;taken principles,</HI> yet you &s;upport what
<PB N="32" REF="34">
you are per&s;uaded is truth with &s;uch high &s;uch &s;elf-denying virtue, that not to applaud, not to imitate you would be contemptible. You have and ought to have a will of your own. You prac|ti&s;e what you believe to be the &s;evere&s;t precepts of duty, with more than human fortitude. You re&s;olve, in this particu|lar, not to offend the prejudices of your family, and the world. I &s;ubmit. To indulge &s;en&s;ibility but a little were to be heart-broken! But no per&s;onal grief can authori&s;e me in de&s;erting the po&s;t I am placed in; nor palliate the crime of neg|lecting its duties. <HI>To the end of time I &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in thinking you mine by right;</HI> but I will never trouble you more with an a&s;&s;ertion of that right&mdash;Never!&mdash;Unle&s;s &s;ome new and unexpected claim
<PB N="33" REF="35">
&s;hould &s;pring up, of which I &s;ee no pro|bability.</P>
<P>He bowed and was retiring.</P>
<P>Stay, Frank, I have &s;omething more to &s;ay to you&mdash;I have a requi&s;ition to make which after what has pa&s;&s;ed would to common minds appear unfeeling and almo&s;t capricious cruelty; but I have no fear that yours &s;hould be liable to this mi&s;|take. Recollect but who and what you are, remember what are the be&s;t pur|po&s;es of exi&s;tence, the noble&s;t efforts of mind, and then refu&s;e me if you can&mdash;I have formed a project, and call upon you for aid&mdash;Cannot you gue&s;s?</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton, madam&mdash;?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>I fear it is a dangerous one; and, whether my fears originate in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s
<PB N="34" REF="36">
or in penetration, they mu&s;t be &s;poken. Yes, madam, I mu&s;t warn you that the pa&s;&s;ions of Mr. Clifton are, in my opi|nion, much more alarming than the re|&s;entment of your father.</P>
<P>But they are alarming only to my&s;elf. And ought danger to deter me?</P>
<P>Not if the good you de&s;ign be practi|cable.</P>
<P>And what is impracticable, where the will is re&s;olved?</P>
<P>Perhaps nothing&mdash;But the effort mu&s;t be great, mu&s;t be uncommon.</P>
<P>Has he not a mind worthy of &s;uch an effort? Would not his powers highly honour truth and virtue?</P>
<P>They would.</P>
<P>Will not you give me your a&s;&s;i&s;tance?</P>
<P>I would, madam, mo&s;t willingly,
<PB N="35" REF="37">
would he but permit me. But I am his antipathy; a &s;omething noxious; an evil augury.</P>
<P>You have been particular in your at|tentions to me.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t tho&s;e attentions cea&s;e, ma|dam?</P>
<P>They mu&s;t be moderated; they mu&s;t be cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, and then they will not alarm.&mdash;I cannot po&s;&s;ibly be de|ceived in &s;uppo&s;ing it a duty, an indi&s;|pen&s;able duty to re&s;tore the mind of Clifton to its true &s;tation. If I fail, the fault mu&s;t be my own. I am but young, yet many men have addre&s;&s;ed me with the common-place language of admira|tion, love, and I know not what; or rather they knew not what; and, except your&s;elf, Frank, I have not met with one
<PB N="36" REF="38">
from whom half &s;o much might be hoped as from Clifton. He is the brother of my bo&s;om friend. Surely, Frank, it is a worthy ta&s;k&mdash;Join with me!&mdash;There is but one thing I fear. Clifton is haughty and intemperate. Are you a duelli&s;t, Frank?</P>
<P>No, madam.</P>
<P>Then you would not fight a duel?</P>
<P>Never, madam. No provocation, not the brand of cowardice it&s;elf, &s;hall ever induce me to be guilty of &s;uch a crime.</P>
<P>Frank!&mdash;Oh excellent, noble youth!</P>
<P>Here, Loui&s;a, our conver&s;ation ab|ruptly ended. The company had ri&s;en from table, and we heard them in the corridor. I reque&s;ted him to retire, and he in&s;tantly obeyed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">
Oh! Loui&s;a, with what &s;en&s;ations did he leave my mind glowing!&mdash;His con|viction equals certainty, <HI>that I act from mi&s;taken principles!&mdash;To the end of time he &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in thinking me his by right!&mdash;</HI>Can the power of language afford words more &s;trong, more po&s;itive, more point|ed?&mdash;How unju&s;t have I been to my cau&s;e!&mdash;For &s;urely I cannot be in an error!&mdash;'Tis afflicting, 'tis painful, nay it is almo&s;t terrifying to remember!<HI>&mdash;Per&s;i&s;t to the end of time?&mdash;</HI>Why did I not think more deeply?&mdash;I had a dark kind of dread that I &s;hould fail!&mdash;It cannot be the fault of my cau&s;e!&mdash;Wrong him!&mdash;Guilty of inju&s;tice to him!&mdash;Surely, &s;urely, I hope not!&mdash;What! Become an example to the fee|ble and the fooli&s;h, for having indulged

my pa&s;&s;ions and neglected my duties?&mdash;I?&mdash;His mind had formed a favourite plan, and could I expect it &s;hould be in|&s;tantly relinqui&s;hed?&mdash;I cannot conceive torment equal to the idea of doing him wrong!&mdash;Him?&mdash;Again and again I hope not! I hope not! I hope not!</P>
<P>Then the ki&s;s, Loui&s;a? Did I or did I not do right, in &s;hewing him how truly I admire and love his virtues? Was I or was I not guilty of any crime, when, in the very acme of the pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;o total|ly di&s;regarded the cu&s;toms of the world? Or rather, for that is the true que&s;tion, could it produce any other effect than that which I intended? I am per&s;uaded it could not. Nor, blame me who will, do I repent. And yet, my friend, if you &s;hould think it wrong, I confe&s;s I &s;hould

then feel a pang which I &s;hould be glad not to de&s;erve. But be &s;incere. Though I need not warn you. No fal&s;e pity can or ought to induce you to de&s;ert the cau&s;e of truth.</P>

<HEAD>FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Chateau de Villebrun.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALL is over!&mdash;My hopes are at an end!&mdash;I am awakened from a dream, in which pain and plea&s;ure were mingled to &s;uch exce&s;s as to render its continu|ance impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Nor is this all. This trial, &s;evere as it was, did not &s;uffice. To the de&s;truc|tion
<PB N="41" REF="43">
of hope has been added the a&s;&s;ault of in&s;olence, accompanied with a por|tion of obloquy which heart &s;carcely can &s;u&s;tain&mdash;Oh, this Clifton!&mdash;But&mdash;Pati|ence!</P>
<P>Yet let me do her ju&s;tice. Mi&s;taken though I am &s;ure &s;he is, the motives of her conduct are &s;o pure that even mi&s;take it&s;elf is lovely in her; and a&s;&s;umes all the energy, all the dignity of virtue. Oh what a &s;oul is hers! Her own pa&s;&s;ions, the pa&s;&s;ions of others, when &s;he acts and &s;peaks, are all in &s;ubjection to principle. Yes, Oliver, of one thing at lea&s;t &s;he has convinced me: &s;he has taught me, or rather made me feel, how poor a thing it is to be the &s;lave of de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Not that I do not &s;till adore her!&mdash;Ay, more than ever adore! But from
<PB N="42" REF="44">
henceforth my adoration &s;hall be worthy of her&s;elf, and not degrading to me. From her I have learned what true love is; and the le&s;&s;on is engraven on my heart. She can con&s;ider per&s;onal grati|fication with apathy, yet burn with a martyr's zeal for the promotion of uni|ver&s;al good.</P>
<P>And &s;hall I not ri&s;e equal to the bright example which &s;he has &s;et me? Shall I admire yet not imitate?</P>
<P>Did &s;he de&s;pi&s;e me? Did &s;he reject me for my own &s;ake?&mdash;No!&mdash;All the affection which mind can feel for mind &s;he has avowed for me! And &s;hall I grieve becau&s;e another may be more happy?&mdash;And why more?&mdash;In what?&mdash;Is not the union of &s;ouls the fir&s;t the mo&s;t permanent of all alliances? That
<PB N="43" REF="45">
union is mine! No power can &s;hake it. She openly acknowledges it; and has done, daily, hourly, in every word, in every action. Whither then would my wi&s;hes wander?</P>
<P>Oliver, I am a man, and &s;ubject to the &s;hakes and agues of his fragile na|ture!&mdash;Yet it is a poor, a wretched plea; a fooli&s;h, and a fal&s;e plea. Man is weak becau&s;e he is willing to be weak. He crouches to the whip, and like a coward pities while he la&s;hes him&s;elf. His wil|ful phren&s;y he calls irre&s;i&s;tible, and weeps for the torments which he him&s;elf inflicts.</P>
<P>But once again this Clifton!&mdash;Read and tell me how I ought to act&mdash;I have received a blow from him, Oliver!&mdash;Yes,
<PB N="44" REF="46">
have tamely &s;ubmitted to receive a blow!&mdash;</P>
<P>What intolerable prejudices are the&s;e! Why does my heart rebel &s;o &s;ternly, at what virtue &s;o po&s;itively approves?</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t left her; had that in&s;tant been rejected by her for his &s;ake; had been &s;ummoned to aid her, in weeding out error from his mind. She &s;hewed me it was a noble ta&s;k, and communi|cated to me her own divine ardour. Yes, Oliver; I came from her, with a warmed and animated heart; partici|pating all her zeal. The mo&s;t rigid, the mo&s;t painful of all ab&s;tinence was de|manded from me; but &s;hould I &s;hrink from a duty becau&s;e I pity or becau&s;e I love my&s;elf? No. Such pu&s;illanimity
<PB N="45" REF="47">
were death to virtue. I left her, while my thoughts glowed with the ardour of emulating her heroi&s;m; and burned to do him all the good which &s;he had pro|jected.</P>
<P>He was at the end of the corridor, and &s;aw me quit her apartment. His hot &s;pirit caught the alarm in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and blazed in his countenance. He ac|co&s;ted me&mdash;</P>
<P>So, &s;ir! You are very familiar with that lady! What right have you to in|trude into her apartments?</P>
<P>When &s;he her&s;elf de&s;ires me, &s;ir, I have a right.</P>
<P>She de&s;ire you! 'Tis fal&s;e!</P>
<P>Sir?</P>
<P>'Tis fal&s;e, &s;ir!</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">
Fal&s;e?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir. And fal&s;ehood de&s;erves to be cha&s;ti&s;ed!</P>
<P>Cha&s;ti&s;ed? [It is in vain, Oliver, to endeavour to conceal the truth from my|&s;elf; my folly incurred its own puni&s;h|ment&mdash;I repeated] Cha&s;ti&s;ed? [I was lunatic enough to walk up to him, with a ridiculous and de&s;picable air of defiance. He re-echoed my words, and in&s;tantly in contempt &s;truck me on the cheek with the back of his hand.]</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir; cha&s;ti&s;ed!</P>
<P>His ra&s;hne&s;s re&s;tored me to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the farcical heroi&s;m which I had been aping. I hurried from him, without ano|ther word.</P>
<P>Oliver, I can conceive nothing more
<PB N="47" REF="49">
painful than this wre&s;ting, this tearing of pa&s;&s;ion from its purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I walked a few minutes to calm my thoughts, and wrote him the following note.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FEEL at pre&s;ent the humility of my &s;ituation: but not from your blow; for that has brought me to my&s;elf, not humbled me. No man can be de|graded by another; it mu&s;t be his own act: and you have degraded your&s;elf, not me. My error is in having, for a moment, yielded to the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion. If you think I fear you, con|tinue to think &s;o; till I can &s;hew my for|bearance is from a better motive. Cowardice might make me kill you;
<PB N="48" REF="50">
but true courage will teach me calmly to hear the world call me coward, ra|ther than commit an act &s;o wicked, &s;o abhorred, as that of taking or of throwing away life. I wi&s;hed to &s;eek your friend&s;hip; and even now I will not &s;hun you. Make the world ima|gine me a coward; imagine me one your&s;elf, if you can. I will live un|der the &s;uppo&s;ed obloquy; and leave the tenor of my life to &s;hew whether living be the act of fear, or of rea&s;on. I pardon you, &s;ir, and leave you to pardon your&s;elf.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>My forbearance and this letter miti|gated my &s;en&s;e of pain. Yet I am very ill &s;atisfied with my&s;elf. Am I &s;o ea&s;ily
<PB N="49" REF="51">
to be moved? 'Tis true the &s;cene I had ju&s;t quitted was fermenting, as it were, in my veins, and &s;haking my whole &s;y&s;|tem.</P>
<P>What is wor&s;e, I am child enough to be tormented, in my own de&s;pite, by the recollection of having received a blow! And why? In many countries, and even in my own, among the cla&s;s in which I was born, the &s;tigma is none, or trifling&mdash;Stigma?

<P>Well, well, Oliver&mdash;I hope the&s;e agi|tations are over; and that from this time thou wilt begin to think better of me.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
I communicate my whole thoughts to thee. If the experiments made upon my mind can be of any u&s;e to thine, my letters will then an&s;wer the be&s;t of the purpo&s;es for which they are written.</P>

<HEAD>COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Chateau de Villebrun.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t, Fairfax, plea&s;ed me. You &s;ay truly, and I like your remark, <Q>Such fellows ought not to claim a moment's attention from me. I &s;hould bru&s;h them away, like flies from my forehead, when they pre&s;ume to tea&s;e or &s;ettle them&s;elves upon me.</Q> I have taken
<PB N="52" REF="54">
your advice, and fly-flapped the wa&s;p that was more willing than able to &s;ting.</P>
<P>I have lately grown di&s;&s;atisfied with my&s;elf; I know not how, or why. I &s;u&s;pect this youth, in part, has made me &s;o, with his vi&s;ionary morality. I hate &s;uch &s;ermonizing. Who has a right to control me? Who&s;e &s;lave am I? I was born to rule, not to be ruled. My appetites are keen, my de&s;ires va&s;t, and I would enjoy. Why el&s;e am I here? Delay to me is in&s;ufferable; &s;u&s;pen&s;e di&s;tracts me; and the po&s;&s;ibility that another &s;hould be preferred to my&s;elf drives me mad! I too heartily de&s;pi&s;e the tame creatures, that crawl upon the earth, to &s;uffer oppo&s;ition from them. Who would be braved by bats and bee|tles, buzzing in his ears?</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">
I never before &s;aw a woman whom any temptation could have induced me to marry; and now I have found one I am troubled with doubts, infe&s;ted with fears, and &s;ubjected to the intolerable penance of procra&s;tination. Impeded in my cour&s;e; and by what? Why, I am told to &s;crutinize my&s;elf, and to di&s;cover whether I am quite as perfect as it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary I &s;hould be! 'Tis unju&s;t! 'Tis unkind! I did not doubt of her per|fections; and both love and pride, equally jealous of their honour, demand that mine &s;hould have been taken for granted.</P>
<P>The time has been when this would have been revenged. But I &s;eem to be half &s;ubdued. My fierce &s;pirit, before &s;o untameable, declines contending with
<PB N="54" REF="56">
her. Not but I frequently feel it &s;trug|gling with &s;uffocation, kindling, and again ready to bur&s;t into a more furious blaze.</P>
<P>Yet let me do her ju&s;tice. Mild, gentle, and affectionate, &s;he conquers my impetuo&s;ity with prayers, and &s;ooth|ing, and with kindne&s;s irre&s;i&s;tible. Still &s;he conquers.</P>
<P>Then &s;he &s;uffers the&s;e animals to tor|ment me. I am angry to think that, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, I &s;hould have &s;o en|tirely lo&s;t all power over my&s;elf!</P>
<P>But where is the mortal that can look and not love? Were I my&s;elf not an actor in the play, how &s;hould I enjoy the perplexity of the&s;e French <HI>amoureux!</HI> There are I know not how many of them; each more bu&s;y than the other.
<PB N="55" REF="57">
'Tis laughable to &s;ee with what indu&s;try they labour to make love according to her liking; for they find that their own trifling manner is inefficient, and can never &s;ucceed with her. One of them, that &s;aid crazy Proven&ccedil;al Count, is very earne&s;t indeed, in his endeavours; but &s;he keeps him in due awe. And it is well per|haps for him that &s;he does, or I would. Still however he is damned trouble&s;ome and impertinent; and I could wi&s;h &s;he were more peremptory. Yet it is unju&s;t to blame her, for the animal is &s;o full of antics, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be angry.</P>
<P>After all, I am far from &s;atisfied re|&s;pecting my&s;elf and this youth, whom I conde&s;cended to cha&s;ti&s;e. It was beneath me. It gave him a &s;ort of right to de|mand &s;atisfaction: but he affects forbear|ance,
<PB N="56" REF="58">
becau&s;e, as he pretends, he de&s;pi&s;es duelling. And I hear he has actually given proofs of the mo&s;t undaunted cou|rage. He wrote a &s;hort note of only three or four &s;entences on the &s;ubject, after I had &s;truck him, which produced a very uncommon effect upon me, and made me half repent, and accu&s;e my&s;elf of haughtine&s;s, ra&s;hne&s;s, and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things torture me. I am out of patience with them. What right has any pedant, becau&s;e he thinks proper to vex and entangle his own brain with doubts, to force his gloomy dogmas upon me? Let tho&s;e who love &s;ack|cloth wear it. Mu&s;t I be made mi&s;era|ble, becau&s;e an over-curious booby be|wilders him&s;elf in inquiry, and galls his con&s;cience, till, like the wrung withers

What, &s;hall I not enjoy the free air, the glorious &s;un, the flowers, the fruits, the viands, the whole &s;tores of nature? Who &s;hall impede, who &s;hall dare di&s;turb the banquet? Were it even a dream, the meddling fool that waked me &s;hould dearly repent his ra&s;hne&s;s.&mdash;Let &s;pecu|lative blockheads brew metaphy&s;ical nec|tar, make a ha&s;h of axioms, problems, corollaries and demon&s;trations, and feed on ideas and fatten. Be theirs the fea&s;t of rea&s;on and the flow of &s;oul. But let me banquet with old Homer's jolly gods and heroes, revel with the Maho|metan houris, or gain admi&s;&s;ion into the &s;avoury &s;anctorum of the gormandizing

prie&s;thood, &s;nuff the fumes from their altars, and gorge on the fat of lambs. Let cynic Catos tru&s;s up each his &s;lo|venly toga, rail at Heliogabalus, and fa&s;t; but let me receive his card, with&mdash;<Q>Sir, your company is reque&s;ted to dine and &s;up.</Q></P>
<P>I cannot forget this gardener's &s;on. I am &s;ometimes angry that I &s;hould for a &s;ingle in&s;tant trouble my&s;elf with a fel|low &s;o much beneath me; and at others equally angry, for not &s;hewing him the re&s;pect which he claims. There are moments in which I have even feared him as a rival; for when &s;he &s;peaks to him, which &s;he is very ready to do, the u&s;ual mildne&s;s and benevolence of her voice and features are evidently in|crea&s;ed.
<PB N="59" REF="61">
She mu&s;t, &s;he &s;hall be more circum&s;pect. Indeed I have made her &s;o within the&s;e few days.</P>
<P>Prithee forgive all this. My mind is not at ea&s;e; but I know not why I &s;hould infect you with its malady. Write, relate &s;omething plea&s;ant; tell me what has happened to you la&s;t, and relieve the di&s;&s;atisfaction &mdash; I feel by your unaf|fected flow of gaiety. Adieu.</P>

met di&s;appointment, &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf in|to &s;ufferings, which &s;well into exi&s;tence in proportion as they are imagined to be real. His evident determination is not to permit any &s;elfi&s;h motive to detach him from the great purpo&s;es of life; but cheerfully to &s;ubmit to what is inevita|ble, without thinking it an evil.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I have been indulg|ing a hope, which at moments has ap|peared almo&s;t a certainty, that Clifton, by our mutual efforts, &s;hall acquire all this true ardour, which is &s;o lovely in Frank. How forry am I to ob&s;erve that the haughtine&s;s of Clifton and the cold|ne&s;s of Frank &s;eem to be increa&s;ing! To what can this be attributed? Their behaviour is &s;o peculiar that I almo&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="64">
dread &s;omething has happened, with which I am unacquainted.</P>
<P>But perhaps it is the pre&s;ent temper of my mind: the effect of &s;en&s;ations too irritable, doubts too tremulous, and fears too ea&s;ily excited. I cannot forget the conver&s;ation: it haunts me; and, did not Frank &s;et me the example of fortitude, I have &s;ometimes doubted of my own per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Oh, how mean is this in me! Is not the ta&s;k I have propo&s;ed to my&s;elf a worthy and a high one? Am I not convinced it is an inevitable duty? And &s;hall he, even under a contrary conviction, out|&s;trip me in the career?&mdash;Generous and excellent youth, I will imitate thy mo&s;t eminent virtues!</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">
The Count de Beaunoir &s;till conti|nues to be particular, in what he calls his adoration of me; but his tone and &s;tyle are too romantic to authorize me in any &s;erious remon&s;trance. Clifton is not plea&s;ed, and the Count and he have fallen into a habit of rallying each other, and vaunting of what lovers dare do, to prove their affection. Their irony took &s;o &s;erious a turn, ye&s;terday, that Clifton propo&s;ed they &s;hould load their pi&s;tols, and both holding by the corner of a handkerchief, fire at each other. Con&s;i|dering the temper in which they were, and the con&s;titutional extravagance of the Count, the propo&s;al was terrifying: but I had the pre&s;ence of mind to give it
<PB N="64" REF="66">
an air of ridicule, by &s;aying&mdash;You do not under&s;tand the true point of gal|lantry, gentlemen. You &s;hould go to Japan, where one noble-blooded per&s;on draws his &s;abre, and di&s;patches him&s;elf, to prove he is acquainted with the high punctilio and very e&s;&s;ence of honour; while another, enraged that he &s;hould be in waiting and have a di&s;h to carry up to the emperor's table, reque&s;ts he would conde&s;cend to live till he can come down again, that he may &s;hew he knows what honour is as well as his di&s;ingenu|ous enemy, who had taken &s;uch an un|fair advantage.</P>
<P>The Count laughed, and Clifton I &s;hould hope was not di&s;plea&s;ed that it was impo&s;&s;ible the conver&s;ation &s;hould again
<PB N="65" REF="67">
a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame de&s;perate and ab&s;urd tone.</P>
<P>I took an opportunity to a&s;k him pri|vately how he could indulge &s;uch intem|perate pa&s;&s;ions; but I was obliged to &s;often my admonition by all po&s;&s;ible mild|ne&s;s. I know not whether I did right, but I even took his hand, pre&s;&s;ed it be|tween mine, and reque&s;ted of him, with an ardour which I think mu&s;t &s;ink deeply in his mind, to do ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, to exert tho&s;e powers of thought which he certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and to re&s;train pa&s;|&s;ions which, if not re&s;trained, mu&s;t deter me, or any woman worthy of him, from a union that would be &s;o dangerous.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion would have been &s;tronger, but that unfortunately his quick &s;en&s;ations took a different turn. Feeling
<PB N="66" REF="68">
me cla&s;p his hand, he dropped on his knee, and with an ec&s;ta&s;y which he &s;eemed unable to re&s;i&s;t ki&s;&s;ed both mine, talked &s;omething of bli&s;s unutterable, and, recollecting the conclu&s;ion of my &s;entence, added that the very thought of lo&s;ing me was madne&s;s. We were in|terrupted, and I began to fear le&s;t my true motive &s;hould have been mi&s;under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>Oh! Loui&s;a, what a world is this! Into what fal&s;e habits has it fallen! Can hypocri&s;y be virtue? Can a de&s;ire to call forth all the be&s;t affections of the heart be mi&s;con&s;trued into &s;omething too de|grading for expre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>I know not, but I begin to fear that no permanent good can be effected at pre&s;ent, without peril. If &s;o, &s;hall I
<PB N="67" REF="69">
li&s;ten only to my fears; &s;hrink into &s;elf; and &s;hun that which duty bids me en|counter? No. Though the prejudices of mankind were to overwhelm me with &s;orrows, for &s;eeking to do good, I will &s;till go on: I will per&s;evere, will accom|pli&s;h or die.</P>
<P>Yet I know not why I am in this mood! But &s;o I am, and Loui&s;a will for|give me. I talk of &s;ufferings? What have I &s;uffered? What can tho&s;e who, mature in rea&s;on, are &s;uperior to preju|dice &s;uffer?</P>
<P>But who are they? My prejudices hourly ri&s;e up in arms again&s;t me. Every day am I obliged to combat what the day before I thought I had de&s;troyed. Could we, at the &s;ame moment that we correct our own mi&s;takes, correct tho&s;e

of the whole world, the work were done at once. But we have to &s;truggle and to &s;truggle; and, having to-day &s;haken off the burs that hung about us, to-mor|row we give a glance and perceive them &s;ticking as clo&s;ely and as thick as ever!</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to que&s;tion Frank, concerning the&s;e alarms; but he &s;eems purpo&s;ely to avoid giving me an opportunity. Per|haps however I am mi&s;taken; and I hope I am. The re&s;tle&s;s fancy is frequently too full of doubts and fears. Oh, how beautiful is open, artle&s;s, undi&s;gui&s;ed truth! Yet how continually are di&s;&s;imu|lation and concealment recommended as virtues! Whatever mi&s;takes, public or private, they may think they have di&s;co|vered, and however beneficial it might be to correct them, men mu&s;t not pub|&s;i&s;h
<PB N="69" REF="71">
their thoughts; for that would be to libel, to defame, to &s;peak or to write &s;candal!</P>
<P>When will the world learn that the unlimited utterance of all thoughts would be virtuous? How many half-di&s;covered half-acknowledged truths would then be promulgated; and how immediately would mi&s;take, of every kind, meet its proper antidote! How affectionately and unitedly would men &s;oon be brought to join, not in puni&s;h|ing, nor even in reproving, but in re|forming fal&s;ehood! Aided and encou|raged by your dear and worthy mother, we have often di&s;cour&s;ed on the&s;e things, Loui&s;a: and the common accidents of life, as well as tho&s;e peculiar to my&s;elf,

render &s;uch conver&s;ations &s;weet to recol|lection.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t conclude: for though we write be&s;t when thoughts flow the mo&s;t freely, yet at pre&s;ent I find my&s;elf more inclined to think than to write.</P>

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Chateau de Villebrun.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW not, Loui&s;a, how to begin! I have an accident to relate which has alarmed me &s;o much that I am half afraid it &s;hould equally alarm my friend. Yet the danger is over, and her &s;en&s;ations cannot equal ours. She can but imagine what they were. But it is &s;o incredible,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
&s;o mad, &s;o dreadful! Clifton is &s;trangely ra&s;h!</P>
<P>He had been for &s;ome days di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied, re&s;tle&s;s, and di&s;turbed. I knew not why, except that I had de&s;ired time for mutual con&s;ideration, before I would per|mit him to &s;peak to Sir Arthur. He has half terrified me from ever permitting him to &s;peak&mdash;But then he has more than repaired all the wrong he had done. There is &s;omething truly magnanimous in his temper, but it has taken a very erroneous bent. The chief &s;ubject of my la&s;t was the di&s;tance which I ob&s;erved between him and Frank Henley. Lit|tle did I know the rea&s;on. But I will not anticipate: only, remember, be not too much alarmed.</P>
<P>Frank was but one of the actors,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
though the true and indeed &s;ole hero of the &s;cene I am going to relate. Indeed he is a wonderful, I had almo&s;t &s;aid a divine youth! It took birth from the Count de Beaunoir.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t, I mentioned the &s;trange defiance of the pi&s;tols and the handker|chief: and would you think, Loui&s;a, a conver&s;ation &s;o frantic could be re|newed? It is true it &s;hewed it&s;elf under a new though &s;carcely a le&s;s horrible a&s;pect.</P>
<P>We were ye&s;terday walking in the park, in which there is a remarkable lake, &s;mall but romantic. I before &s;poke I believe of our rowing on it in boats. We were walking be&s;ide it on a &s;teep rock, which continues for a con&s;iderable
<PB N="74" REF="76">
length of way to form one of its banks. The Count and Clifton were before: I, Frank Henley, and a party of ladies and gentlemen were following at a little di&s;|tance, but not near enough to hear the conver&s;ation that was pa&s;&s;ing between your brother and the Count.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the latter had fir&s;t begun once again to talk of times of knight errantry, and of the feats which the <HI>preux cheva|liers</HI> had performed for their ladies. The headlong Clifton, utterly de&s;pi&s;ing the pretended admiration of what he was per&s;uaded the Count dur&s;t in no manner imitate, after &s;ome &s;arca&s;tic expre&s;&s;ions of his contempt, madly but &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;ked the Count if he dur&s;t jump off the rock into the lake, to prove his own cou|rage.
<PB N="75" REF="77">
Shew your &s;oul, &s;aid he, if you have any! Jump you fir&s;t, &s;aid the Count&mdash;!******!</P>
<P>Imagine, Loui&s;a, if you can, the &s;hock I received when, not knowing what had pa&s;&s;ed, but in an apparent fit of frenzy, I &s;aw him de&s;perately ru&s;h to the &s;ide of the rock, and da&s;h him&s;elf headlong down into the water! It was at an angle, and we had a full view of him falling!</P>
<P>Every &s;oul I believe &s;hrieked, except my&s;elf and perhaps Frank Henley. Never had I &s;o much need of the forti|tude to which I have endeavoured to ha|bituate my mind.</P>
<P>The gentlemen all ran to the &s;ide of the rock.&mdash;They &s;aw Clifton, after ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, &s;ink! He had jumped
<PB N="76" REF="78">
from a place where the &s;helving of the rock, under water, by projecting had &s;tunned him as he fell.</P>
<P>Frank perceived the danger: he threw off his hat and coat, and ran to another part, where the height was &s;till more dreadful! Indeed, Loui&s;a, it ex|cites horror to look at the place! But he &s;eems to be &s;uperior to fear. He plunged down what might well be called an aby&s;s; and, after ri&s;ing for a few &s;e|conds to breathe, dived again in &s;earch of poor Clifton.</P>
<P>He was twice obliged to ri&s;e and take breath. The third time he found him, ro&s;e with him, turned him upon his own back, and &s;wam with him a very con&s;i|derable di&s;tance before he could find a place &s;hallow enough to land.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79">
To all appearance Clifton was lifele&s;s! But the excellent, mo&s;t excellent when you &s;hall hear all, the heroic Frank immediately applied him&s;elf to the re|mainder of his office. He &s;tayed not a moment to re&s;t, but lifted him a &s;eeming corp&s;e from the earth, threw him once more on his back, and ran fa&s;ter than any of us to the chateau, carried him up &s;tairs, undre&s;&s;ed him him&s;elf, put him between the blankets, and gave every nece&s;&s;ary order with as much pre&s;ence of mind as if there had been neither acci|dent nor danger. Wet as he was he lo&s;t not a thought upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Never &s;hall I forget the indefatigable a&s;&s;iduity with which he laboured to re|&s;tore your brother to life; the anxiety which he &s;truggled to conceal; the va|riety
<PB N="78" REF="80">
of means he employed; the inge|nuity of his conjectures and the huma|nity of every motion!</P>
<P>Two hours were I and he and all of us held in this dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e. At la&s;t he was &s;ucce&s;sful; and the relief I felt, the load that &s;eemed removed from my heart, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe!</P>
<P>When your brother was perfectly come to him&s;elf, Frank &s;uffered him to be bled. For it had been propo&s;ed before; but Frank, with a determination that could not be with&s;tood, refu&s;ed to admit of it; though he had been intreated, and at la&s;t openly and loudly blamed, by the &s;ur|geon and tho&s;e who believed in him, for his pertinacity. But Frank was not to be &s;haken, even by the very &s;erious fear of future accu&s;ation. He followed, as
<PB N="79" REF="81">
he tells me, the opinion of John Hun|ter; and well might he think it of more worth than that of the per&s;on who pre|tended to advi&s;e. But it requires no common degree of re&s;olution to per&s;i&s;t, in this manner, in the right; and wholly to de&s;pi&s;e calumny and its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>If you think, Loui&s;a, that after this I can add nothing in prai&s;e of Frank you are greatly mi&s;taken; for what is to come rai&s;es his character almo&s;t to an enviable dignity.</P>
<P>Could you imagine that this very Frank Henley, this undaunted, deter|mined, high-&s;ouled Frank, who had flung him&s;elf down the horrid precipice after your brother, who had &s;wum with him, run with him, ri&s;ked being &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;ome &s;ort his murderer, and at la&s;t re|&s;tored
<PB N="80" REF="82">
him to life, had the very day be|fore received from the hand of this &s;ame brother&mdash;a blow!&mdash;If, Loui&s;a, there be one being upon earth capable of at|taining virtues more than human, it is &s;urely Frank Henley!</P>
<P>Much prai&s;e however, as well as blame, is ju&s;tly due to Clifton. I never &s;aw a heart more painfully wrung, by the &s;en&s;e of an injury committed and of a good &s;o unexampled received, as his has been. It was he who told of his own behaviour. His total want of power to make retribution is the theme by which he is pained and oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Frank, uniform in genero&s;ity, di&s;|claims any &s;uperiority, and affirms Clif|ton would have done the &s;ame, had he been in the &s;ame danger. I think I
<PB N="81" REF="83">
would, an&s;wered Clifton, in a tone that &s;hewed he felt what he &s;poke: but I know my&s;elf too well to &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have &s;o unremittingly per&s;evered, like you, in the performance of an office of humanity which &s;eemed hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction was ju&s;t, di&s;intere&s;ted, and worthy the di&s;cernment of a mind like that of your brother.</P>
<P>Clifton &s;ays that, though he cannot think like Frank [We hope to make him, Loui&s;a.] yet he cannot but admire the magnanimity with which he acts up to his principles, and proves his &s;ince|rity.</P>
<P>Oh, my friend! You can conceive all the terrors of the &s;cene! So fine a youth, &s;o accompli&s;hed, &s;o brave, the brother of my Loui&s;a, brought to Paris
<PB N="82" REF="84">
to meet an untimely death! I the cau&s;e of his coming thither! I the innocent in&s;tigator of this la&s;t ra&s;h act! The eyes of all upon me! The horror of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e!&mdash;It was indeed a trial!</P>
<P>Yet who knows what accidents may occur in life? Who can &s;ufficiently cheri&s;h fortitude; and by anticipating defy misfortune? Violently as my feel|ings were a&s;&s;aulted, there yet may be, there are, &s;hocks more violent, &s;cenes more dreadful in the world. Nor is it impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;uch may be my lot. And if they were, I hope I &s;till &s;hould bear up again&s;t them all.</P>
<P>It is true I may not always have a Frank Henley to cheri&s;h and in&s;pire hope. His con&s;tant theme was&mdash;"He is not dead!" And I once heard him
<PB N="83" REF="85">
murmuring to him&s;elf, with a kind of prophetic energy&mdash;"He &s;hall not die!"&mdash;It was this <HI>&s;hall not</HI> by which he was &s;aved: for, with any other crea|ture upon earth, I am per&s;uaded he had been gone for ever. Oh this noble per&s;everance! It is indeed a godlike virtue!</P>
<P>The Count is le&s;s in &s;pirits, le&s;s extra|vagant, &s;ince this accident. It &s;eems to hang upon his mind, as if he had been out-braved. His anxiety, as might well be expected from &s;uch a temper, was exce&s;&s;ive, while Clifton was in dan|ger: but he &s;eems to repent now, that he did not follow the mad example. <HI>Parbleu! Madame, je &s;uis Proven&ccedil;al; on dit que j'ai la t&ecirc;te un peu chaude; mais Me&s;&s;ieurs les Anglois vont diablement vite</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="86">
<HI>aux &eacute;preuves! Mes compatriotes m&ecirc;me ne &s;ont pas &s;i fous!&mdash;Je ne &s;uis pas content de moi&mdash;J'aurais du faire le &s;aut&mdash;J'aurais &s;auv&eacute; la vie &agrave; mon rival!&mdash;Voil&agrave; une belle occa&s;ion manqu&eacute;e, et beaucoup de gloire &agrave; jamais perdue pour moi!</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Sdeath!

I ought to have leaped after him: I &s;hould have &s;aved the life of my rival! It was lo&s;ing a glorious opportunity; and I have robbed my&s;elf of thus much fame for ever!</NOTE></P>
<P>My mind at pre&s;ent is not entirely tranquil. The recollection of a temper &s;o ra&s;h as Clifton's preys upon me. Yet, where there are qualities &s;o high, and powers &s;o uncommon, &s;hall I defpair?
<PB N="85" REF="87">
Shall I &s;hrink from an act of duty? It is a ta&s;k I have pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf. Shall I witne&s;s the fortitude of Frank, and be my&s;elf &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;comfited? No, Loui&s;a.

<P>YOUR three la&s;t letters, my dear Anna, have affected me in a very un|common manner. The pure pa&s;&s;ion, the noble re&s;ignation, and the fortitude of Frank Henley are unparalleled. Not to admire, not to e&s;teem, not to love &s;uch virtues is impo&s;ible. His un&s;haken
<PB N="93" REF="95">
patience, his genero&s;ity, his forgivene&s;s, his courage, his per&s;everance, are inimi|table proofs of his &s;uperiority. Who can forbear wi&s;hing him &s;ucce&s;s? Ought he not to command it; to &s;ay it is mine; truth and ju&s;tice dare not deny it to me?</P>
<P>Indeed, Anna, my mind is &s;trangely in doubt. To be guilty of inju&s;tice to &s;uch worth is &s;urely no common guilt. And yet my brother&mdash;Headlong luna|tic!

<P>That I de&s;ire to &s;ee my brother all that emulation and wi&s;dom could make him, the friend and hu&s;band of my Anna, the rival of her virtues, and the bo&s;om intimate of him whom &s;he is willing to forego for this brother's &s;ake; that I de|&s;ire this, ardently, vehemently, is mo&s;t true. If the end be attainable, it is a noble enterprize. But the difficulties! What are they? Have they been well examined?&mdash;I, with my Anna, &s;ay mind can do all things with mind: truth is ir|re&s;i&s;tible,
<PB N="95" REF="97">
and mu&s;t finally conquer. But it has many modes of conquering, and &s;ome of them are tragical, and dreadful.</P>
<P>To &s;ee my Anna married to &s;trife, wa&s;ting her fine powers to reform habits which, though they may be checked, may perhaps be too deep ever to be eradicated, to &s;ee all her exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibilities hourly preyed upon by in|efficient attempts to do good, for which in&s;tead of prai&s;e and love &s;he might meet neglect, reproach, or perhaps &s;tern in&s;ult&mdash;Oh! It is a painful thought! She would not pine; &s;he would not weakly &s;ink into dejection, and de&s;ert her duties, in pity to her own misfor|tunes.&mdash;No&mdash;But &s;till it is an unhappy, nay, it is an abhorred &s;tate.</P>
<P>I am bewildered. One train of rea|&s;oning
<PB N="96" REF="98">
overturns another, and I know not what to advi&s;e. There are times in which the&s;e con&s;equences appear mo&s;t probable; and there are others in which I &s;ay no, it is impo&s;&s;ible! Brutality it|&s;elf could not be &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;o de&s;truc|tive of its own felicity! Anna St. Ives would win a &s;avage heart! And my brother evidently has quick and delicate &s;en&s;ations; capable of great good. But then are they not capable of great harm? Yes: but are they, would they be ca|pable of harm with her? Would not &s;he command them, regulate them, har|monize them? Again, and again. I know not.</P>
<P>One thing however let me add. Let me conjure the friend of my bo&s;om not to &s;uffer her&s;elf to be &s;wayed, by the re|membrance
<PB N="97" REF="99">
of that friend&s;hip. Nay, if &s;he do not feel a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, let me intreat, let me admoni&s;h her to de&s;i&s;t, before it be too late; and before further encouragement &s;hall &s;eem to authorize the pre&s;uming Clifton, for pre&s;uming I am convinced he will be, to found claims upon her kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh that he were indeed worthy of her! Would that he could but ri&s;e to &s;ome|thing like that enviable dignity! And can he not?&mdash;Indeed I would not plead again&s;t him; but neither would I be in|&s;trumental in rendering my friend, who is &s;urely born a ble&s;&s;ing to the earth, mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>I am angry with my&s;elf for my own indeci&s;ion: but in vain; I have no re|medy. I &s;ometimes conclude this inde|ci&s;ion
<PB N="98" REF="100">
ought to act as a warning, and for that rea&s;on I have painted my feel|ings as they are. If yours &s;hould re|&s;emble them, I firmly and loudly &s;ay&mdash;Anna, de&s;i&s;t! If not, I then have no advice to give. For this I blame my|&s;elf, but ineffectually.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured however that, under all circum&s;tances of future life, be they ad|ver&s;e or pro&s;perous, my be&s;t wi&s;hes will be with you, and my heart and &s;oul ever yours.</P>

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> My mamma and I have mutu|ally written to Frank Henley: you may ea&s;ily imagine in what tone and &s;tyle. But I could wi&s;h my brother to &s;ee our letters. We have both thought it be&s;t
<PB N="99" REF="101">
to forbear writing to him; his temper being wayward, and tetchy. We would much rather he &s;hould be obliged to feel, indirectly, what our opinions and &s;en&s;ations are, than learn them from any formal addre&s;s, which he is &s;o liable to mi&s;con&s;true. It is mo&s;t probable that Frank will not mention the&s;e letters. But, if you &s;hew him this, and being of my opinion will join in the reque&s;t, I have no doubt he will then comply. There is one &s;entence in my letter which makes me likewi&s;e wi&s;h that Clifton &s;hould know I have reque&s;ted Frank would permit him to &s;ee what I have written; otherwi&s;e that &s;entence might very probably by him be mi&s;interpreted.

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are returned to Paris. The Marquis and his bride have taken leave of their country plea&s;ures, and are gone to Fontainebleau, to be pre&s;ented at court.</P>
<P>The &s;trange incident of Clifton excited much conver&s;ation, in which my name
<PB N="102" REF="104">
and his were frequently joined. The Count de Beaunoir became le&s;s particular in his behaviour to me, in con&s;equence of the re&s;erve which I thought it right to a&s;&s;ume. I find however that he told Sir Arthur, after running over a great num|ber of enthu&s;ia&s;tic epithets, in his wild way, all in my prai&s;e, that he perceived at pre&s;ent I preferred another; and that he had too high a &s;en&s;e of honour to put any re&s;traint on a lady's inclinations. But if my mind &s;hould change, and his per|&s;on, fortune, &s;word, and life could give me plea&s;ure, they &s;hould eternally be at my command. He likewi&s;e means in a few days to follow the court to Fontaine|bleau, as he &s;aid; and he again repeated he had lo&s;t a fine opportunity of con|vincing
<PB N="103" REF="105">
me how he adored me; and that he was <HI>diablement f&acirc;ch&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>Clifton has entirely altered his beha|viour to Frank; he now treats him with unaffected freedom and re&s;pect. But his impatience relative to me has not abated. Tomorrow we are to have &s;ome conver|&s;ation, after which I imagine he wi&s;hes to make propo&s;als to Sir Arthur.</P>
<P>Would you think, Loui&s;a, that I &s;ome|times &s;uffer my&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed into fears; and that I then find my&s;elf ready to retract, or at lea&s;t que&s;tioning whether I ought to proceed.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething fatally erroneous in the impatient propen&s;ities of the hu|man mind. How &s;eldom does it &s;tay &s;o fully to examine a que&s;tion as to leave no remaining doubt, and to act on a
<PB N="104" REF="106">
preconcerted and con&s;i&s;tent plan! Yet it never acts with &s;afety, or with &s;ati&s;|faction, except when it has or imagines it has made this examination. If our motives be few, &s;low, and feeble, we then are heavy, dull, and &s;tupid: if they be quick, numerous, and &s;trong, we are too apt implicitly to obey fir&s;t impul&s;es, and to hurry headlong into folly and extra|vagance. Yet the&s;e la&s;t only can give energy; and, having them, wi&s;dom will con&s;i&s;t in being able to curb them, &s;o as to give full time for con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The con&s;cious want of this in my&s;elf is what I blame. How often am I &s;ur|pri&s;ed by unexpected circum&s;tances, which I ought to have fore&s;een, and again&s;t which I ought to have provided! If I have any doubts of my&s;elf, if I am
<PB N="105" REF="107">
not certain of producing tho&s;e effects on the mind of Clifton which I know I ought to be able to produce, it becomes me to recede. Or rather it becomes me to apply my&s;elf, with the re&s;olution of which I am &s;o ready to vaunt, to attain that which is attainable, to di&s;cover the true means, the clue to his mind, and to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected my&s;elf of being influenced by his fine form, and the charms of his wit and gaiety. At others I have even doubted whether I were not more actuated by an affection for my Loui&s;a, than by a &s;en&s;e of incum|bent duty. But, con&s;ider the &s;ubject how I will, that there is a duty, and that I am called upon to fulfil it, is an uner|ring deci&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">
There mu&s;t be no concealment. I mu&s;t explain my whole chain of rea&s;on|ings to him: for nothing appears more indubitable to me than that duplicity never can conduce to good. The only fear is that I &s;hould be deficient in my detail, and pre&s;ent my plan &s;o as to give it a fal&s;e appearance. Truth partially told becomes fal&s;ehood: and it was a kind of blind con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this which fir&s;t induced men to countenance di&s;&s;i|mulation. They felt their inability to do ju&s;tice to truth, and therefore con|cluded hypocri&s;y was a virtue, and, &s;trange to tell, truth it&s;elf &s;ometimes a vice. It was a lamentable mi&s;take. It is partial truth, or in other words fal&s;e|hood, which is the vice.</P>
<P>Clifton has from the beginning been a
<PB N="107" REF="109">
great favourite with Sir Arthur. He contradicts none of my father's preju|dices; he admires grounds and parks beautifully laid out; has a ta&s;te for archi|tecture; points out the defects and excel|lencies of the buildings of France with much di&s;crimination; has a great re&s;pect, like Sir Arthur, for family, and prides him&s;elf in being the &s;on of an honourable mother; recounts, in a plea&s;ant and lively manner, the anecdotes he has heard; and relates his own adventures, &s;o as to render them amu&s;ing. There is therefore no fear of oppo&s;ition from Sir Arthur.</P>
<P>He has another advantage with the family. My uncle, Lord Fitz-Allen, is at pre&s;ent in Paris, on his return from Switzerland, and Clifton has been intro|duced
<PB N="108" REF="110">
to him by his kin&s;man, Lord Evelyn, who is making a &s;hort excur&s;ion to the &s;outh of France. The near rela|tion&s;hip of your brother to this noble lord has given him great con&s;equence with my uncle, who has once more con|de&s;cended to re&s;tore me to favour. Could I or did it become me entirely to conceal tho&s;e feelings which his arrogance in|&s;pires, I &s;hould &s;tand much higher in his e&s;teem. As it is, he acts more from the love of his rank and family, that is of him&s;elf, than of me; and has accordingly &s;ignified his mandatory approbation to Sir Arthur. As nothing however in the way of family advantage is to be ex|pected from him, he having &s;everal children and a prodigious quantity of dignity to maintain, his behe&s;t is not
<PB N="109" REF="111">
altogether &s;o omnipotent as it might otherwi&s;e be.</P>
<P>My brother, agreeably to his grand|father's will, has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Edgemoor e&s;tate, which is eight hundred a year. This I imagine will oblige Sir Arthur, in de&s;pite of his predilection, to retrench &s;ome of his improving ex|pences. He mentioned the circum|&s;tance to me, and I thought that a good opportunity once more to attack his ruling pa&s;&s;ion. Our conver&s;ation &s;oon became animated. I boldly de&s;canted on the u&s;e and abu&s;e of riches, on the claims of hone&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and on the tur|pitude of &s;eeking &s;elf-gratifications, and neglecting to promote the great ends for which men ought to live, the &s;preading
<PB N="110" REF="112">
of truth, the rewarding of genius, and the propagation of mind.</P>
<P>But it was to little purpo&s;e. Sir Ar|thur did not under&s;tand me; and I was more angry at my&s;elf than at him, as well I might be, for wanting the power to ren|der my&s;elf intelligible. He as u&s;ual was amazed to hear he had not a right to do what he plea&s;ed with his own, and to be told it was not his own. Nor was he &s;paring in petti&s;h reproof to the &s;elf|&s;ufficient young lady, who thought pro|per to di&s;pute the propriety and wi&s;dom of his projects.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion that continually occurs to me is, when &s;hall tho&s;e beings who ju&s;tly claim &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding, and thence a right to direct the world,
<PB N="111" REF="113">
find &s;ome &s;imple and ea&s;y mode of con|vincing the mi&s;taken, and by conviction of eradicating error?</P>
<P>Adieu. Ble&s;&s;ings be with you. I &s;hall mo&s;t probably write by the next po&s;t, for I wi&s;h you to be as perfectly acquainted as po&s;&s;ible with every thing that pa&s;&s;es, that I may profit by the ad|vice of a friend &s;o dear, &s;o true, and &s;o di&s;cerning.</P>

<HEAD>SIR ARTHUR ST. IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received yours of the 30th ult. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omitted.</NOTE> hone&s;t Aby, and it gave me great plea&s;ure to hear you had made &s;o much di&s;patch. Wenbourne-Hill is the gar|den of Eden. The more I &s;ee the more I am convinced. What is there here to
<PB N="114" REF="116">
be compared to my temples, and my groves, and my glades? Here a mount and a &s;hrubbery! There a dell concealed by brambles! On your right a &s;tatue! On your left an obeli&s;k, and a &s;un-dial! The obeli&s;k is fixed, yet the dial &s;hews that time is ever flying. Did you ever think of that before, Aby?</P>
<P>Apropos of this dial: Sir Alexander I remember &s;aid it was u&s;ele&s;s half the day; becau&s;e it was &s;haded from the &s;un to the we&s;t and the north, by the old grove. His advice was that the grove &s;hould be grubbed up; but it certainly would be much ea&s;ier to remove the &s;un dial, obeli&s;k, and all.</P>
<P>I am &s;o delighted with the recollection of the&s;e things, Abimelech, that I had half forgotten the rea&s;on of my writing
<PB N="115" REF="117">
to you. The &s;ubject is di&s;agreeable enough; and I &s;hould not be &s;orry if I were never to remember it more.</P>
<P>I very much fear we mu&s;t &s;top our im|provements. My &s;on has claimed and entered upon the Edgemoor e&s;tate. I thought my&s;elf &s;ure that he would re|main &s;atisfied as he was till my death. What could be more rea&s;onable? I ar|gued with him to the very utmo&s;t, but to no purpo&s;e. He is in great ha&s;te to &s;et up for him&s;elf; and I don't know whe|ther he would not eject me out of Wen|bourne-Hill, if he had the power. In vain did I tell him that his pay in the guards, added to the three hundred a-year which I had before allowed him, was more than any young man knew how properly to &s;pend. He has only him&s;elf
<PB N="116" REF="118">
to think of; and he very po&s;itively de|clares he never means to have a family, for he will never marry. I believe he is quite &s;erious in his declaration: and if &s;o, what does he want with an e&s;tate of eight hundred a-year? He ought to con|&s;ider that; and to remember that a pro|vi&s;ion mu&s;t be made for his &s;i&s;ter. But no; he con&s;iders only him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indeed I hear but an indifferent ac|count of him: he is a fa&s;hionable gen|tleman, and would rather &s;quander his money at the gaming-table, than &s;uffer it to remain in the family. He has been a wild youth. I have &s;ometimes won|dered where he got all the money which I am told he has &s;pent. Not from me I am &s;ure. And though I have often heard of his deep play, I do not remem|ber
<PB N="117" REF="119">
to have ever heard of his winning. But he follows his own cour&s;e. My arguments that I had the family dignity to &s;upport, his &s;i&s;ter to marry, and mortgages to pay off, were all in vain.</P>
<P>He was equally deaf when I pleaded the improvements that I was making; all for his &s;ake. For you know, Aby, he is to have them when I am gone: and go I mu&s;t, &s;ome time or another.</P>
<P>He had even the confidence to tell me that, if Wenbourne-Hill were his, he would quickly undo every thing that I have been doing.</P>
<P>Is not this a &s;ad thing, Aby? For what have I been labouring? Have not we both &s;pent our lives in contriving? How many charming thoughts have we
<PB N="118" REF="120">
had! What plea&s;ure have we taken in planting and pulling up, digging and &s;cattering, watering and draining, turf|ing and gravelling!</P>
<P>Talking of water, Aby, I cannot for|bear mentioning a mo&s;t delightfully ro|mantic lake, which I have met with in the park of the Marquis de Villebrun. It is the only thing, in the laying out of grounds, that I have &s;een to plea&s;e me in all France. One part of it a fine le|vel: &s;uch a &s;weep! At the other extre|mity nothing but rocks and precipices. Your &s;on Frank threw him&s;elf headlong down one of them, into the water, to &s;ave a gentleman's life. Were you but to &s;ee it, you would be a&s;toni&s;hed. They have called it the Engli&s;hman's leap. I
<PB N="119" REF="121">
would not do &s;uch a thing for a million of money. I &s;hould be dead enough if I did.</P>
<P>But Frank is a bold young man, and I a&s;&s;ure you, Aby, highly e&s;teemed by my daughter; ay and by my&s;elf too, and by every body: very highly indeed. He was the whole talk for I know not how many days.</P>
<P>But about this money, Aby. I &s;hall &s;oon want a good round &s;um, if I am not mi&s;taken. I may venture, Aby, to give you a hint that I expect very &s;oon, indeed I don't know how &s;oon, a propo&s;al &s;hould be made to me for my daugh|ter: and if it be, I am &s;o plea&s;ed with the party, who let me tell you is a fine &s;pirited young fellow, that I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall not think of refu&s;ing my con&s;ent;
<PB N="120" REF="122">
e&s;pecially as he is &s;o much in the good graces of my daughter. In this ca&s;e, I cannot do le&s;s than pay twenty thou&s;and pounds down.</P>
<P>I am afraid, hone&s;t Aby, we mu&s;t re|nounce the wilderne&s;s! But when you know the party, I think you will allow I could not act otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Indeed, I find, however we may plea&s;e our&s;elves, we can never &s;atisfy our chil|dren. Here too has Anna been lectur|ing me, about money thrown away, as &s;he is plea&s;ed to conceive; and has &s;aid a great deal indeed, again&s;t what I thought could not have been found fault with. But &s;o it is! Friends, relations, children, all are wi&s;er than our&s;elves! All are ready enough to di&s;cover or to &s;uppo&s;e blemi&s;hes! Would you think it
<PB N="121" REF="123">
po&s;&s;ible for any body to be acquainted with Wenbourne-Hill and do any thing but admire? My hope, nay my deter|mination was to have made it the para|di&s;e of England, and to have drawn &s;trangers far and near to come and be delighted with its beauties. But the&s;e rubs and cro&s;&s;es put one out of heart with the mo&s;t excellent thoughts and contrivances.</P>
<P>Let me know what you think can be done in the&s;e money matters, if things &s;hould be as I expect. You are per|fectly acquainted with the &s;tate of my affairs. I &s;ee no way but that of mort|gaging more deeply.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly vexatious to think of &s;topping our proceedings, Aby. But
<PB N="122" REF="124">
what can be done? However, as I do not intend to &s;tay much longer here, we can talk more to the purpo&s;e on the&s;e matters when we meet in England.</P>
<P>Perhaps it would be better to begin by di&s;charging the workmen gradually; which you will find proper opportunities to do, Aby. And if you were, by way of talk in the neighbourhood, to &s;ay that you thought nothing more could be done to Wenbourne-Hill, and that you had rea&s;on to believe that was my opinion likewi&s;e, &s;uch a report might tie the tongues of cavillers: for I would not have it thought we &s;top for want of money.</P>
<P>You may write to me here, in an&s;wer to this; for we &s;hall not leave Paris be|fore

your letter will come to hand. And &s;o, good Abimelech, farewell.</P>

<P>Ah, dear a me, what have I a bin talkin to your mo&s;t gracious onnur?

If I wus the onnura|ble father of &s;itch ever mercifool affabi|bility, would a not I be fain to give her gems and rubies, and carbuncles, if I had 'em? Who &s;hould gain &s;ay me?

truly? Your noble onnur has too much bowels of fatherly mi&s;eration. No, no!&mdash;Your noble onnur has a clencht it; take her now &s;he is in the humour.

<P>Whereof your onnur was a men&s;hin|nin a &s;tagnation to be put in the &s;poke of the wheel of improvements. Where|of if I might a paradventer to put in my oar, I &s;hould &s;ay why that &s;hould be as it might a be happen.

For why? All would then be clear and above board; and we &s;hould all a know who and who was together. That would be &s;ummut! We might then a be happen to rai&s;e the wind; and the wherewithalls might a be forth cummin.</P>
<P>And &s;o, as matters and thinks is likely to turn out, to be &s;ure I mu&s;t &s;ay that your onnur has a hit the nail on the head. Whereof as your onnur has a u&s;hered your commands, I &s;hall begin to take care of the kole, and &s;end them there rap&s;callions a packin.</P>
<P>And as to the flickers and fleers of the neighbours, your onnurable onnur, a leave me to humdudgin they. I'll a &s;end their wits a wool-gatherin. For why? Your onnurable onnur has always a had my lovin kindne&s;s of ble&s;&s;ins of

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR brother has this moment left me. Our conver&s;ation has been ani|mated; and, as u&s;ual, I &s;it down to com|mit what has pa&s;&s;ed to paper, while it is fre&s;h on my memory.</P>
<P>He began with the warme&s;t expre&s;|&s;ions of the force of his pa&s;&s;ion. I have
<PB N="147" REF="149">
no rea&s;on to doubt of their &s;incerity; and, if affection can be productive of the end which I hope, its &s;trength ought to give me plea&s;ure. He would &s;carcely &s;uffer me to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible there could be any cau&s;e of difference between us: let me but name my conditions and they &s;hould be fulfilled. He would un|dertake all that I did, all that I could require; and it was with difficulty that I could per&s;uade him of the po&s;&s;ibility of promi&s;ing too fa&s;t. This introduced what was mo&s;t material in our dialogue.</P>
<P>My heart a&s;&s;ures me, madam, &s;aid he, that I never gave you the lea&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity and ardour of my pa&s;&s;ion: and I &s;hould hope that the &s;ears, which I have &s;ometimes thought
<PB N="148" REF="150">
you too readily entertained, are now di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>My fears are chiefly for, or rather of, my&s;elf. I doubt whether any per&s;on has &s;o high an opinion of the powers and energy of your mind as I have: but I think tho&s;e powers ill directed, and in danger of being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I own, madam, I have been &s;ome|times grieved, nay piqued, to perceive that you do not always think quite &s;o well of me as I could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>You wrong me. You your&s;elf do not think &s;o highly of your&s;elf as I do.</P>
<P>Yet you &s;uppo&s;e me to be in danger?</P>
<P>Of being mi&s;led. Some of my opi|nions and principles, or &s;ome of yours, are erroneous, for they differ; I cannot
<PB N="149" REF="151">
at this moment but perceive how liable I am to be mi&s;under&s;tood. I cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the awkwardne&s;s of the &s;itu|ation in which I now place my&s;elf. My age, my &s;ex, the cu&s;toms of the world, a thou&s;and circum&s;tances contribute to ca&s;t an air of ridicule upon what ought to be very &s;erious. But I mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t. Do you endeavour to forget the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances; and con&s;ider only the words, not the girl by whom they are &s;poken.</P>
<P>It is not you, madam, but I who ought to dread appearing ridiculous. But for your &s;ake&mdash;Let me but obtain your favour, and make me as ridiculous as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I told you &s;o!&mdash;Should the lordly lettered man &s;ubmit to have his prin|ciples
<PB N="150" REF="152">
que&s;tioned, by an untutored wo|man? Be &s;incere: your mind revolts at it?</P>
<P>I feel the ju&s;tne&s;s of your &s;atire. Men are tyrants.</P>
<P>Prejudice is a tyrant: there is no other tyranny.</P>
<P>Madam!</P>
<P>That is one of my &s;trange opinions.</P>
<P>It may be true; I am willing to think it is. Such things are indifferent to me. Let me but have your con&s;ent, to &s;peak to Sir Arthur, and I have accompli&s;hed all I wi&s;h. I do not de&s;ire to trouble my&s;elf with examining opinions, true or fal&s;e. I am determined to be of your opinion, be it what it will.</P>
<P>That is, you avow that the gratifica|tion
<PB N="151" REF="153">
of your de&s;ires is the chief pur&s;uit of your life. We have now found the e&s;|&s;ential point on which we differ.</P>
<P>Is not happine&s;s, madam, the univer|&s;al pur&s;uit? Mu&s;t it not, ought it not to be?</P>
<P>Yes. But the grand di&s;tinction is be|tween general and individual happine&s;s. The happine&s;s that centres in the good of the whole may for the pre&s;ent find momentary interruption, but never can be long &s;ubverted: while that individual happine&s;s, of which almo&s;t the whole world is in pur&s;uit, is continually blun|dering, mi&s;taking its object, lo&s;ing its road, and ending in di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Then, madam, we mu&s;t all turn monks, preach &s;elf-denial, fa&s;t, pray,
<PB N="152" REF="154">
&s;courge away our &s;ins, live groaning, and die grieving.</P>
<P>[I &s;miled. It is his u&s;ual way, when he thinks I am got a little in the clouds, to draw &s;ome humorous or &s;atirical picture, to bring me down to what he e&s;teems common-&s;en&s;e. But, as I am convinced that truth only need to be re|peated, and in&s;i&s;ted on, whenever there is an opportunity, in order finally to be received, the be&s;t way is always to join in the laugh, which is inoffen&s;ive, unle&s;s petti&s;hne&s;s give it a &s;ting.]</P>
<P>You find your&s;elf obliged at pre&s;ent to con&s;ider me as a whim&s;ical girl, with a certain flow of &s;pirits, and much va|nity, de&s;iring to di&s;tingui&s;h her&s;elf by &s;ingularity?</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155">
No, madam. Whatever you may think of me, my heart will not endure a thought to your di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, forbear your kind re|proaches. Every time you differ with me in &s;entiment, you cannot but think &s;omething to my di&s;advantage. It is &s;o with all of us. The very end of this pre&s;ent explanation is &s;incerity. We each think well of the other: but do we think &s;ufficiently well? Is there a certainty that our thoughts are in no danger of changing? Of all the actions of private life, there is not one &s;o &s;olemn as that of vowing perpetual love: yet the heedle&s;s levity with which it is daily performed, proves that there is &s;carcely one on which le&s;s &s;erious reflection is be&s;towed. Can we be too careful not to deceive our|&s;elves?
<PB N="154" REF="156">
Ought we not minutely to ex|amine our hopes and expectations? Ought not you and I, in particular, to be cir|cum&s;pect? Our imaginations are vivid, our feelings &s;trong, our views and de|&s;ires not bounded by common rules. In &s;uch minds, pa&s;&s;ions, if not &s;ubdued, be|come ungovernable, and fatal.</P>
<P>I am very con&s;cious, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, do not fancy I &s;eek to accu&s;e: my purpo&s;e is very different. My mind is no le&s;s ardent than yours, though edu|cation and habit may have given it a different turn. It glows with equal zeal to attain its end. Where there is much warmth, much enthu&s;ia&s;m, I &s;u&s;pect there is much danger. We had better never meet more, than meet to be mi&s;e|rable.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157">
For heaven's &s;ake, madam, do not torture me with &s;o impo&s;&s;ible a &s;uppo|&s;ition!</P>
<P>You expect one kind of happine&s;s, I another. Can they coale&s;ce? You imagine you have a right to attend to your appetites, and pur&s;ue your plea|&s;ures. I hope to &s;ee my hu&s;band for|getting him&s;elf, or rather placing &s;elf-gratification in the pur&s;uit of univer&s;al good, deaf to the calls of pa&s;&s;ion, willing to encounter adver&s;ity, reproof, nay death, the champion of truth, and the determined the unrelenting enemy of error.</P>
<P>I think, madam, I dare do all that can be required of me.</P>
<P>I know your courage is high. I know too that courage is one of the fir&s;t and
<PB N="156" REF="158">
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential qualities of mind. Yet perhaps I might and ought to doubt, nay to a&s;k, whether you dare do many things.</P>
<P>What is it, madam, that I dare not do?</P>
<P>Dare you receive a blow, or &s;uffer your&s;elf fal&s;ely to be called lair, or cow|ard, without &s;eeking revenge, or what honour calls &s;atisfaction? Dare you think the &s;ervant that cleans your &s;hoes is your equal, unle&s;s not &s;o wi&s;e or good a man; and your &s;uperior, if wi&s;er and better? Dare you &s;uppo&s;e mind has no &s;ex, and that woman is not by nature the inferior of man?&mdash;</P>
<P>Madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, nay, no compliments; I will not be interrupted&mdash;Dare you think that
<PB N="157" REF="159">
riches, rank, and power, are u&s;urpations; and that wi&s;dom and virtue only can claim di&s;tinction? Dare you make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of your whole life to over-turn the&s;e prejudices, and to promote among mankind that &s;pirit of univer&s;al benevolence which &s;hall render them all equals, all brothers, all &s;tripped of their artificial and fal&s;e wants, all participating the labour requi&s;ite to produce the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, and all combining in one univer&s;al effort of mind, for the pro|gre&s;s of knowledge, the de&s;truction of error, and the &s;preading of eternal truth?</P>
<P>There is &s;uch energy, madam, in all you &s;ay, that, while I li&s;ten to you, I dare do any thing, dare promi&s;e any thing.</P>
<P>Nay, but the daring of which I &s;peak,
<PB N="158" REF="160">
mu&s;t be the energy of your own mind, not of mine.</P>
<P>Do not di&s;tre&s;s your&s;elf and me with doubts, madam. I have heard you your&s;elf &s;ay that truth ultimately mu&s;t prevail. I may differ with you in &s;ome points; but I am willing to hear, wil|ling to di&s;cu&s;s; and, if truth be on your &s;ide, there can be no danger.</P>
<P>The only danger is in the feeble or fal&s;e colouring which the defenders of truth may give it, and not in truth it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am too well convinced of your power to feel your doubts. You oblige me to &s;ee with your eyes, hear with your ears, believe what you believe, and reject what you think incredible. I am and

mu&s;t be whatever you plea&s;e to make me. You have but to pre&s;cribe your own conditions.</P>
<P>Pre&s;cribe I mu&s;t not. If I can per|&s;uade, if I can win upon your mind&mdash;</P>
<P>If&mdash;! You won my whole &s;oul the very fir&s;t moment I &s;aw you! Not a word or action of mine but what has proclaimed the burning impatience of my pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>True: the burning impatience&mdash;Your eagerne&s;s to a&s;&s;ent will not &s;uffer you to examine. Your opinions and principles are tho&s;e which the world mo&s;t highly approves, and applauds: mine are what it daily calls extravagant, impracticable, and ab&s;urd. It would be weak in me to expect you &s;hould implicitly receive remote truths, &s;o contradictory to this general practice, till you have fir&s;t deeply
<PB N="160" REF="164">
con&s;idered them. I a&s;k no &s;uch miracle. But if I can but turn your mind to &s;uch con&s;iderations, if I can but convince you how ine&s;timable they are, even to your|&s;elf as well as to the world at large, I &s;hall then have effected my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Of that, madam, be &s;ure&mdash;You &s;hall &s;ee!&mdash;Upon my honour, you &s;hall!&mdash;I will order a fur-cap, a long gown, a white wand, and a pair of &s;andals this very day! No Grecian ever looked more grave than I will! Nay, if you de&s;ire it, razor &s;hall never touch my chin more.</P>
<P>Well, well; equip your&s;elf &s;peedily, and I will provide you with a wooden di&s;h, a lanthorn, and a tub.</P>
<P>But then, having made your condi|tions, you now grant me your con&s;ent?</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="165">
That is obliging me once more to put on my &s;erious face&mdash;The danger in which I &s;o lately &s;aw you hangs heavily on my mind; that and the warm pa&s;&s;ions by which it was occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>And my exce&s;s of ardour, to demon|&s;trate my love, you regard as a proof of my having none.</P>
<P>How pa&s;&s;ion over&s;hoots it&s;elf! Your conclu&s;ion is as precipitate as was your proof.</P>
<P>I cannot be cool, madam, on this &s;ub|ject. I wonder to &s;ee you &s;o! Did af|fection throb and burn in your bo&s;om, as it does in mine, I am per&s;uaded it would be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>We are neither of us &s;o entirely &s;ati&s;|fied with each other as we ought to be,
<PB N="162" REF="166">
to induce either me to con&s;ent or you to apply to Sir Arthur.</P>
<P>For heaven's &s;ake, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Hear me patiently, for a moment. Previous to this conver&s;ation, I was con|vinced of the folly and danger of exce&s;|&s;ive ha&s;te. Should you imagine I have any &s;elf-complacency or caprice to gra|tify, by delay, you will do me great in|ju&s;tice: I &s;olemnly prote&s;t I have none. My own intere&s;t, had I no better motive, would make me avoid &s;uch conduct. The incon&s;i&s;tencies and vain antics of the girl, which are ju&s;tly enough &s;tigma|tized by the epithets flirting and co|quetry, are repaid tenfold upon the wife. I would deal openly, hone&s;tly, and gene|rou&s;ly; but not ra&s;hly. I have every
<PB N="163" REF="167">
predilection in your favour which you could wi&s;h; &s;uch doubts excepted as I have declared. But I mu&s;t not give ei|ther you or the world cau&s;e to accu&s;e me of levity. My con&s;ent to &s;peak to Sir Arthur would be generally under&s;tood as a pledge to proceed; not it is true by me, if I &s;aw ju&s;t cau&s;e to retract: but, though I earne&s;tly de&s;ire to reform, I almo&s;t as earne&s;tly wi&s;h not unnece&s;&s;arily to offend the prejudices of mankind.</P>
<P>Nay let me beg, let me conjure you&mdash;[He took both my hands with great ar|dour.]</P>
<P>And let me beg too, let me conjure you, not to think meanly or unkindly of me, when I tell you that I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on a &s;hort delay.</P>
<P>I will kneel! I will do any thing&mdash;!</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="168">
Do nothing which your heart does not approve; it never can be the way to forward any worthy &s;uit. For my part, I mu&s;t tell you, which you may reckon among my faults, that when I have once con&s;idered a &s;ubject, I am a very po&s;i|tive and determined girl. This may be thought ob&s;tinacy; but &s;uch I am, and &s;uch therefore you ought to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>And when, madam, may I now pre|&s;ume to hope?</P>
<P>Do not &s;peak as if you were di&s;plea&s;ed. Indeed it is far from my intention to of|fend.</P>
<P>You are too well acquainted, madam, with your own power of plea&s;ing, to fear giving offence.</P>
<P>Far the contrary, for I fear it at this moment.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="169">
You are kind and killing both in a breath.&mdash;Be doubly kind, and &s;uffer me immediately to &s;peak to Sir Arthur.</P>
<P>I told you I am fixed, and I a&s;&s;ure you it is true.</P>
<P>When then may I hope?</P>
<P>I could have wi&s;hed to have &s;een my friend, your &s;i&s;ter, fir&s;t: but perhaps Sir Arthur may make &s;ome &s;tay in London, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to delay a moment longer than &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Let us both con&s;ider what has pa&s;&s;ed this morning, and provided no new accident &s;hould intervene&mdash;</P>
<P>Another leap from a rock?</P>
<P>Provided our approbation and e&s;teem for each other &s;hould continue, and in|crea&s;e, I will a&s;k for no further delay, after we come to London.</P>

Well, well. It is the poor lover's duty to thank his mi&s;tre&s;s for the great|ne&s;s of her conde&s;cen&s;ion, even when he thinks &s;he u&s;es him unkindly.</P>
<P>I was going to reply, but my enter|pri&s;ing gentleman&mdash;[Indeed, Loui&s;a, your brother is a bold youth]&mdash;&s;natched an unexpected embrace, with more ea|gerne&s;s than fear, and then fell on one knee, making &s;uch a piteous face for forgivene&s;s, &s;o whim&s;ical, and indeed I may &s;ay witty, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;erious. However, I hurried away, and thus the conference ended.</P>
<P>And now, after reviewing what has pa&s;&s;ed, tell me, Loui&s;a, ought I to re|cede? Are not my hopes well founded? Mu&s;t not the reiteration of truth make its due impre&s;&s;ion, upon a mind like

Clifton's? Can it fail? Is he not the man who, for all the rea&s;ons formerly given, truly merits preference?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you that Frank readily complied with your reque&s;t, and Clifton has &s;een the letters. He &s;eems oppre&s;&s;ed, as it were, with a &s;en&s;e of ob|ligation to Frank; which the latter en|deavours to convince him is wrong. Re|ciprocal duties, he &s;ays, always mu&s;t exi&s;t among mankind; but as for obliga|tions, further than tho&s;e, there are none. A grateful man is either a weak or a proud man, and ingratitude cannot exi&s;t; unle&s;s by ingratitude inju&s;tice be meant. Frank's opinions appear to Clifton to be equally novel with mine; and mu&s;t be well under&s;tood, to e&s;cape being treated with mockery.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="172">
It is infinitely plea&s;ing to me to per|ceive the fortitude with which Frank re&s;i&s;ts inclination. He is almo&s;t as cheerful, and quite as communicative, and de&s;irous of making all around him happy, as ever. His con&s;tancy, how|ever, is not to be &s;haken, in one particu|lar.

<HEAD>COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l' Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LAUGH at me if you will, Fairfax. Hoot! Hi&s;s me off the &s;tage! I am no longer worthy of the confraternity of ho|ne&s;t, bold, free and &s;ucce&s;sful fellows. I am dwindling into a whining, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, crouching, very humble, yes if you plea&s;e, no thank you Madam, dangler! I have
<PB N="170" REF="174">
been to &s;chool! Have had my ta&s;k &s;et me! Mu&s;t learn my le&s;&s;on by rote, or there is a rod in pickle for me! Yes! I! That identical Clifton; that bold, gay, &s;pirited fellow, who has &s;o often vaunted of and been admired for his daring! You may meet me with my &s;atchel at my back; not with a &s;hining, but a whindling, lackadai &s;y, green|&s;ickne&s;s face; blubbering a month's &s;orrow, after having been flogged by my ma&s;ter, beaten by my chum, and drop|ped my plum cake in the kennel.</P>
<P>'Tis very true, and I cut a damned ridiculous figure! But I'll remember it. The time will come, or &s;ay my name is not Clifton.</P>
<P>Yet what am I to do? I am in for it, flounder how I will. Yes, yes! She has
<PB N="171" REF="175">
hooked me! She dangles me at the end of her line, up the &s;tream and down the &s;tream, fair water and foul, at her good plea&s;ure! So be it. But I will not forget.</P>
<P>Then &s;he has &s;uch a way of affront|ing, that cur&s;e me if &s;he does not look as if &s;he were doing me a favour: nay and, while &s;he is pre&s;ent, I my&s;elf actu|ally think &s;he is; and, if vexation did not come to my relief, I believe I &s;hould &s;o continue to think. She is the mo&s;t extraordinary of all heaven's creatures: and, in de&s;pite of my railing, I cannot help declaring a mo&s;t heavenly creature &s;he is! Every body declares the &s;ame. I wi&s;h you could but &s;ee her; for a &s;ingle moment, Fairfax; and, having gazed, could you but li&s;ten!&mdash;Her very &s;oul is mu&s;ic. Form, features,
<PB N="172" REF="176">
voice, all are harmony. Then were you to hear her &s;ing, and play&mdash;</P>
<P>But why the devil does &s;he treat me thus? It is &s;omething to which I am un|accu&s;tomed, and it does not &s;it ea&s;ily upon me. If I tamely &s;ubmit to it may I&mdash;! I lie, in my teeth! Submit I mu&s;t, bounce how I will. I have no re|medy&mdash;</P>
<P>She gives me the preference, 'tis true. But what &s;ort of a preference? Why a cold, &s;crutinizing, very con&s;iderative, all wi&s;dom and no pa&s;&s;ion preference. I do not think there is, upon the face of the whole earth, &s;o nau&s;eous a thing as an over do&s;e of wi&s;dom; mixed up, ac|cording to the modern practice, with a quantum &s;ufficit of virtue, and a large double handful of the good of the whole.
<PB N="173" REF="177">
Yet this is the very do&s;e &s;he pre&s;cribes for me! Ay, and I mu&s;t be obliged to &s;wallow it too, let me make what wry faces I plea&s;e, or my very prudent lady is not &s;o deeply in love but &s;he can re|cede! And &s;hall I not note down this in my tablets?&mdash;</P>
<P>I was &s;ufficiently piqued at the fir&s;t delay. Why delay, when I offer? Would you have thought, Fairfax, I &s;hould have been &s;o very ready with a tender of this my plea&s;ant per&s;on, and my dear freedom? And could you moreover have thought it would have been &s;o haughtily rejected?&mdash;No&mdash;Cur&s;e it! Let me do her ju&s;tice, too. It is not haughtily. She puts as many &s;miles, and as much &s;weetne&s;s, and plau&s;ibility,
<PB N="174" REF="178">
into her refu&s;al as heart could de&s;ire. But refu&s;al it is, neverthele&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be further ju&s;t to her: I mu&s;t own that I have acted like a lunatic&mdash;I am mad at the recollection!&mdash;</P>
<P>I told you of the young fellow&mdash;Frank Henley&mdash;Whom I talked of cha&s;|ti&s;ing. Cur&s;e on my petulance! He has doubly cha&s;ti&s;ed me &s;ince! He has had his full revenge! And in &s;uch a generous, noble manner&mdash;I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf&mdash;He has &s;aved my life, and damn me if I do not feel as if I could never forgive him. There was an end of me and my pa&s;&s;ions. What bu&s;ine&s;s had he to interfere?&mdash;He did it too in &s;uch an extraordinary &s;tyle! He appears to have ri&s;ked more, laboured more,
<PB N="175" REF="179">
performed more for me than man almo&s;t ever did for his deare&s;t and &s;worn friend.</P>
<P>Mine was an act of &s;uch ridiculous phren&s;y that I am half a&s;hamed to tell what it was. I jumped headlong down a declivity, becau&s;e I knew I was a good &s;wimmer, into a lake; but, like a block-head, never perceived that I &s;hould get &s;tunned by the &s;helving of the rock, and con&s;equently drowned. And for what, truly? Why to prove to a vapouring, crack-brained French Count, that he was a coward; becau&s;e perhaps he had not learned to &s;wim! When I look back I have ab&s;olutely no patience with my|&s;elf!&mdash;</P>
<P>And then this generous Frank Hen|ley!&mdash;After a &s;till more &s;eemingly de|&s;perate leap than mine, and bringing me
<PB N="176" REF="180">
out of the water, dead as a door nail, two hours did he ince&s;&s;antly labour to re|&s;tore me to life! I, who a few hours be|fore had &s;truck him! And here do I live to relate all this!</P>
<P>I think I could have forgiven him any thing &s;ooner than this triumph over me. Yet he claims and forces my admiration. I mu&s;t own he is a dauntle&s;s fellow&mdash;Yes, he has a heart&mdash;! Damn him! I could ki&s;s him one minute and kill him the next!</P>
<P>He has been the hero of the women ever &s;ince. But they are &s;afe enough, for him. He has principles! He is a man of virtue, for&s;ooth! He is not the naughty cat that &s;teals the cream! Let him be virtuous. Let him lave in his own imaginary waters of purity; but do
<PB N="177" REF="181">
not let him offend others, every mo|ment, by jumping out and calling&mdash;"Here! Look at me! How white and &s;potle&s;s I am!"</P>
<P>As I tell you, the women are bewitch|ed to him; are all in love with him! My &s;i&s;ter, Loui&s;a, does not &s;cruple to tell him &s;o, in her letter! But &s;he is one of the&s;e high-flyers. Nor can I for the &s;oul of me per&s;uade my&s;elf that, family pride excepted, &s;he&mdash;ay, &s;he her&s;elf, my &s;he, would not prefer him to me. But the&s;e gentry are all &s;o intolerably pru|dent that, talk to them of pa&s;&s;ions, and they an&s;wer they mu&s;t not have any. Oh, no! They are above &s;uch mundane weakne&s;s!</P>
<P>As for him, he &s;its in as much &s;tern &s;tate as the Old Red Lion of Brentford.
<PB N="178" REF="182">
Yes, he is my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Never|grin! He cannot qualify, he! He is prime tinker to Madam Virtue, and car|ries no &s;oftening epithets in his budget. Folly is folly, and vice vice in his Good Friday vocabulary&mdash;Titles too are gilt gingerbread, dutch dolls, punch's puppet &s;how. A duke or a &s;cavenger with him are exactly the &s;ame&mdash;Saving and excepting the afore|&s;aid exceptions, of wi&s;dom, virtue, and the good of the whole!</P>
<P>Did you never ob&s;erve, Fairfax, how the&s;e fellows of ob&s;cure birth labour to pull down rank, and reduce all to their own level?</P>
<P>Not but it is cur&s;ed provoking to be obliged to own that a title is no &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port for &s;o much as common &s;en&s;e.
<PB N="179" REF="183">
I &s;incerely think there is not &s;o fooli&s;h a fellow in the three kingdoms, as the no|ble blockhead to whom I have the ho|nour to be related, Lord Evelyn: and, while I have tickled my fancy with the recollection of my own high de&s;cent, cur&s;e me if I have not blu&s;hed to ac|knowledge him, who is the head and re|pre&s;entative of the race, as my kin&s;man! I own however he has been of &s;ome &s;er|vice to me in the pre&s;ent affair; for by his medium I have been introduced to the uncle of my deity, Lord Fitz-Allen, who has con&s;iderable influence in the family, and the very e&s;&s;ence of who&s;e character is pride. He is proud of him|&s;elf, proud of his family, proud of his ti|tles, proud of his gout, proud of his cat, proud of whatever can be called <HI>his;</HI> by
<PB N="180" REF="184">
which appellation in his opinion his very coach-hor&s;es are dignified. I happen to plea&s;e him, not by any qualities of mind or per&s;on, of which he is tolerably in&s;en|&s;ible, but becau&s;e there is a po&s;&s;ibility that I may one day be a peer of the realm, if my booby relations will but be &s;o indulgent as to die fa&s;t enough.</P>
<P>Once more to the&s;e catechumenical in|&s;pectors of morality, the&s;e &s;elf-appointed over&s;eers of the con&s;cioence.</P>
<P>I do not deny that there is &s;ome nay much truth in the doctrines they preach to me. But I hate preaching! I have not time to be wi&s;dom crammed. What concern is it of mine? What have I to do with the world, be it wrong or right, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h? Let it laugh or cry, ki&s;s or cur&s;e, as it plea&s;es! Like the Iri&s;h|man
<PB N="181" REF="185">
in the &s;inking &s;hip, "'Tis nothing to me, I am but a pa&s;&s;enger."</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e airs, I have my le&s;&s;on &s;et me. Ay and I mu&s;t con it too; mu&s;t &s;ay it off by rote; no par|rot better!</P>
<P>There is no re&s;i&s;ting one's de&s;tiny; and to be her &s;lave is preferable to reign|ing over worlds! You have, for you can have, no conception of her and her omnipotence! She is &s;o unlike every other woman on earth! I wonder while I hear her, am attentive, nay am con|vinced! What is mo&s;t &s;trange, though the divine&s;t creature that ever the hand of Heaven fa&s;hioned, the moment &s;he begins to &s;peak you forget that &s;he is beautiful!</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="186">
But &s;he &s;hould not he&s;itate, when I offer. No&mdash;She &s;hould beware of that! At lea&s;t to any other woman the world contains, it would have been dangerous; and I am not &s;ure that even &s;he is &s;afe.</P>
<P>However, I mu&s;t learn to par&s;e my le&s;&s;on, for the pre&s;ent, and be quiet. Yes, yes; &s;he &s;hall find me very com|plai&s;ant. I mu&s;t be &s;o, for live without her I cannot. She mu&s;t &s;he &s;hall be mine. It is a prize which I am born to bear away from all competitors. This is what flatters and con&s;oles me.</P>
<P>You, Fairfax, think your&s;elf more in luck. You continue to range at large. You &s;corn to wear the chain to-day which you cannot &s;hake off laughingly to-morrow&mdash;Well I envy you not&mdash;When
<PB N="183" REF="187">

<HEAD>FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris, Hotel de l'Univer&s;it&eacute;.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SOME events have happened, &s;ince I wrote to thee, on which I meant to have been &s;ilent, till we had met; but I want thy advice on a new incident, and mu&s;t therefore briefly relate what has pa&s;&s;ed. I have had an opportunity of appea&s;ing that hungry vanity, which is
<PB N="185" REF="189">
continually craving after unwhole&s;ome food. I have proved to Clifton that it was not fear which-made me &s;ubmit to obloquy, which in his opinion could only be wa&s;hed away in blood. I have been in&s;trumental in &s;aving his life.</P>
<P>There is a half lunatic count, who was a vi&s;itor at the Chateau, and who is enamoured of her whom all are obliged to love and admire. I know not whe|ther it be their climate, their food, their wine, or the&s;e &s;everal cau&s;es combining and &s;trengthened by habit, or whether it be habit and education only which give the natives of the &s;outh of France &s;o much apparently con&s;titutional ar|dour; but &s;uch the fact appears to be. This count is one of the mo&s;t extrava|gant of all the hot-brained race I have

mentioned. He indulges and feeds his flighty fancy by reading books of chi|valry, and admiring the mo&s;t romantic of the imaginary feats of knight-errantry.</P>
<P>The too haughty Clifton, angry that he &s;hould dare to addre&s;s her to whom he openly paid his court, fell into habi|tual conte&s;ts with him, daring him to &s;hew who could be mo&s;t de&s;perate, and at la&s;t gave a tolerably &s;trong proof that, though he has an infinitely more con|&s;i&s;tent mind, he can be at moments more mad than the count him&s;elf. He leaped down a rock into a lake, where it is pro|bable he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed, but for me.</P>
<P>One would have imagined that what followed would have cooled even a Mar|&s;eillian fever of &s;uch phren&s;y. But no:
<PB N="187" REF="191">
the count has been brooding over the recollection, till he had per&s;uaded him&s;elf he was a di&s;honoured man, and mu&s;t find &s;ome means to do away the di&s;grace. I thought him gone to Fontainebleau; but in&s;tead of that he has ju&s;t been here. He came and inquired of the &s;ervants for the mon&s;ieur who had taken the fa|mous leap; cur&s;ing all Engli&s;h names, as too barbarous to be under&s;tood by a de|licate Proven&ccedil;al ear, and wholly inca|pable of being remembered. The &s;er|vants, thinking he meant me, for I was obliged to leap too, introduced him to my apartment.</P>
<P>Luckily Clifton was out for the day. She and Sir Arthur were with him. I am hourly put to the trial, Oliver,

of &s;eeing him preferred&mdash;But&mdash;P&s;haw&mdash;</P>
<P>After a torrent of crazy compliments from the count, who profe&s;&s;es to admire me, I learned at la&s;t it was Clifton and not me he wanted; and I al&s;o learned in part what was the purport of his errand. His mind was too full not to overflow. Knowing how hot, unruly, and on &s;uch &s;ubjects irrational, the &s;pirits were that were in danger of encountering, I was immediately alarmed. The mo&s;t effec|tual expedient I could conceive to pre|vent mi&s;chief was to &s;hew its actual ab|&s;urdity. I &s;aw no better way than that of making it appear, as it really was, its tragical con&s;equences excepted, ludi|crous. But the difficulty was to give it
<PB N="189" REF="193">
the colouring which &s;hould produce that effect on a mind &s;o di&s;torted.</P>
<P><HI>Mort de ma vie!</HI> &s;aid the count, I &s;hall never pardon my&s;elf for having lo&s;t &s;o fine an opportunity! I am not &s;o heavy as he. I &s;hould not have been hurt by the fall. I &s;hould have &s;aved the life of my rival, and been admired by the whole world! My triumph would have been complete! Every gazette in Eu|rope would have trumpeted the exploit; and the family of Beaunoir would have been rendered famous, by me, to all eternity! No! I never &s;hall forgive my&s;elf!</P>
<P>I think, &s;ir, you ought rather to be angry with me than with Mr. Clifton.</P>
<P><HI>Parbleu!</HI> I have been thinking of that. Why did you prevent me? The thought
<PB N="190" REF="194">

<P>True. The only danger was that, while you were waiting for the thought, the gentleman might have been drowned.</P>
<P><HI>Diable m'emporte!</HI> I had forgotten that. Well then, I mu&s;t have &s;atisfaction of Mon&s;ieur Calif&mdash;Morbleu!&mdash;What is the gentleman's name?</P>

<P>Then, &s;ir, I am afraid there is not a madman in Bedlam who does not daily affront the whole world.</P>

<P>But you were not defied to &s;word, or pi&s;tol. You were defied to leap.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="196">
Well, &s;ir?</P>

<P><HI>Fer et feu!&mdash;</HI>In that ca&s;e, I mu&s;t die!&mdash;Yes, I mu&s;t die! There is no re|medy! I mu&s;t not di&s;honour my fa|mily! No man on earth mu&s;t brave the Count de Beaunoir! I mu&s;t die!</P>

<P>But as I told thee, Oliver, the chief purpo&s;e of my writing is to a&s;k thy ad|vice. Principle, as thou well knowe&s;t, is too &s;evere to admit of fal&s;ehood; direct, or indirect. To mention this dialogue to Clifton might be dangerous. It ought not to be, I grant, but &s;till it might. One would imagine that, in|&s;tead of feeling anger, he mu&s;t laugh, were he told of what has pa&s;&s;ed: but there is no certainty. And is not &s;ilence indirect fal&s;ehood? The count has been here; his errand was to Clifton. Ought he not to be told of it, and &s;uf|fered to judge for him&s;elf? And is not concealment an indirect fal&s;ehood? To me it appears the contrary. He is full

as likely to take the wrong as the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion. I &s;ee a po&s;&s;ibility of harm, but no injury that can be done by &s;ilence. Nor do I my&s;elf perceive how it can be cla&s;&s;ed among untruths. Still the doubt has occurred to my mind, and I have not hitherto an&s;wered it to my own &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell thee with what ardour the count declared him&s;elf an admirer of her who is mo&s;t admirable; and the ro|mantic but very &s;erious efferve&s;cence with which he called him&s;elf her cham|pion; one who had devoted him&s;elf to maintain her &s;uperiority over her whole &s;ex, which he would die affirming; and to revenge her wrongs, if ever mortal &s;hould be daring or guilty enough to do her inju&s;tice. But as I tell thee he

is an eccentric and undefinable cha|racter.</P>
<P>I have lately received a letter from my father, from which I find he has been led, by I know not what mi&s;take, to conclude that Sir Arthur thinks of me for his &s;on-in-law. His letter, as u&s;ual, is a &s;trange one; and &s;uch as I be|lieve no man on earth but him&s;elf could write.</P>

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT &s;trange perver&s;ity of acci|dents is it, Loui&s;a, that has made me mo&s;t deeply indebted to that man, above all others on the face of the earth, who thinks I have treated him unju&s;tly? We are under fre&s;h obligations, nay in
<PB N="202" REF="206">
all probability we again owe our lives to Frank Henley.</P>
<P>We left Paris on Sunday la&s;t; and, after waiting a day and a night for a fair wind at Calais, we embarked on board the packet-boat; the wind &s;till continu|ing unfavourable, though it had changed a little for the better. The channel was very rough, and the water ran high, when we went on board. Sir Arthur would willingly have retreated; but Clifton was too impatient, and prevailed on him to venture.</P>
<P>Before we had reached the middle of the channel, Laura, Sir Arthur, and &s;oon afterward I, were very &s;ea-&s;ick. It is a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation when vi|olent, and would certainly be more ef|fectual
<PB N="203" REF="207">
in rendering a coward fearle&s;s of death than the dying &s;entiments of Se|neca, or Socrates him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The wind increa&s;ed, and the captain laboured &s;everal hours, but in vain, to make the port of Dover. He at la&s;t told us we were too late for the tide, and that the current &s;et again&s;t us, and mu&s;t drive us down to Deal. We proceeded accordingly, and it was dark before we came within &s;ight of the town of Deal; where the captain, in the &s;ea phra&s;e, was obliged to come to an anchor.</P>
<P>The Deal boatmen, who are always on the watch, and are the mo&s;t noted as we are told on the whole coa&s;t for their ex|tortion, &s;oon came up to the &s;hip, invit|ing us to be put on &s;hore, but refu&s;ing to take us for le&s;s than ten guineas.
<PB N="204" REF="208">
Frank and Sir Arthur were de&s;irous that we &s;hould not be impo&s;ed upon; but Clifton pleaded my &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s, and would not li&s;ten to any propo&s;al of delay. He is very peremptory, when his pa&s;|&s;ions are excited; and e&s;pecially when he conceives, as he then did, that rea&s;on is on his &s;ide. There were three boats; but they had agreed among them&s;elves, and two of them kept aloof. This we are told is their common practice, that they may not &s;poil their market by com|petitor&s;hip.</P>
<P>We were not above a mile from &s;hore: Clifton however agreed to their extrava|gant demand, and we went into the boat.</P>
<P>We had not been there many minutes before we perceived that the five boat|men,
<PB N="205" REF="209">
who managed it, were all in li|quor, e&s;pecially he who &s;eemed to be their head man; and that we were much more at the mercy of winds and waves, in our pre&s;ent than in our former &s;itua|tion. Clifton and Frank endeavoured to make them attentive, by reproving them; and probably did &s;ome good; though the an&s;wers they received, in the rugged vulgar idiom of the &s;ea, were not very conciliatory. We were much to&s;&s;ed by the roughne&s;s of the water, but made however toward the &s;hore, though evi|dently in an awkward and dangerous way.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t part of the beach, at Deal, is ex|ce&s;&s;ively &s;teep; and, when the weather is &s;tormy, the waves break again&s;t it very abruptly, and dangerou&s;ly to boats which
<PB N="206" REF="210">
are managed by men that are either ig|norant or have drunken away their &s;en&s;es. When the boat approached the beach, the man at the helm, being &s;tu|pid and it being dark, did not do his duty, and the &s;ide of the boat was da&s;hed again&s;t the beach. The &s;hock almo&s;t over&s;et the boat, and it was half filled by the wave which broke over it. The wa|ter is always a fickle and perilous ele|ment; but in an agitated &s;ea, when the winds howl and the waves roar, foam, da&s;h, retreat, and return with additional threats and raging, it is then truly terri|fic! I &s;hall never forget that night! I think on it even now with horror! One of tho&s;e poor drunken creatures, Lou|i&s;a, was in an in&s;tant wa&s;hed overboard and lo&s;t; almo&s;t without a cry; not
<PB N="207" REF="211">
heard, not aided, &s;carcely remarked; no attempt made to &s;ave him, for all at|tempt was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible: we were within a few yards of land, yet were our&s;elves almo&s;t certain of peri&s;h|ing. The remaining men were little better than helple&s;s; for it was the mo&s;t active of them who was thus mi&s;erably drowned!&mdash;Indeed, Loui&s;a, it was dread|ful!</P>
<P>The reflux of the water was in half a minute likely to be equally violent. Frank, who&s;e pre&s;ence of mind never for&s;akes him, &s;aw what the nature of our danger was; and, &s;haking off poor Laura, who clung round him, begging of him for God's &s;ake to &s;ave her pre|cious life, he flew to the helm, turned the
<PB N="208" REF="212">
head of the boat in its proper direction, and called with that imperious kind of voice which on &s;uch occa&s;ions enforces obedience, for &s;omebody to come to the helm. Clifton was there in an in&s;tant. Keep it, &s;aid Frank, in this po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Every motion was nece&s;&s;arily rapid. Frank was immediately out of the boat, and almo&s;t up to the &s;houlders in the &s;ea. He caught hold of the &s;ide of the boat, retreated a &s;tep or two, &s;et his feet again&s;t the &s;teep beach, and &s;teadied it, to re&s;i&s;t the returning wave. It had no &s;ooner retreated than he called to me, took me in his arms, and in a moment I found my&s;elf in &s;afety on &s;hore!</P>
<P>He returned and brought my father next!</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="213">
Poor Laura &s;hrieked, with fear and impatience! She was the third whom he landed.</P>
<P>He then ordered the boatmen to take care of them&s;elves; and, drunk and re|fractory though they were, they did not neglect to obey the mandate. After which Clifton, leaving the helm, jumped into the water, the &s;ervants having gone before, and we all found our&s;elves &s;afe, after &s;ome of us had concluded we were lo&s;t beyond redemption.</P>
<P>Our peril appears to have been wholly owing to the inebriety of the boatmen; for, had they been able to do their duty, there would have been none, or certainly very little: and it was averted by the active and penetrating mind of Frank, which &s;eems as if it were mo&s;t accurate
<PB N="210" REF="214">
and determined, in its conclu&s;ions and expedients, in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the danger, when common minds would be wholly confu&s;ed and impotent.</P>
<P>Clifton, though he did not &s;o imme|diately perceive what was be&s;t to be done, &s;aw the propriety of it when doing, and immediately a&s;&s;ented, and aided, by keeping the boat in the po&s;ition Frank directed, almo&s;t as e&s;&s;entially as his co|adjutor. I am more and more con|vinced it is accident only that has kept him from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing one of the mo&s;t en|larged of human under&s;tandings. But I mu&s;t likewi&s;e allow that this &s;aid accident has rendered him petulant, impatient of contradiction, too precipitate to be al|ways aware of mi&s;take, and too po&s;itive to be ea&s;ily governed. But the&s;e are
<PB N="211" REF="215">
habitual errors, which time and care will cure.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add too that his affection for me di&s;plays it&s;elf in a thou&s;and various forms. He is apparently never &s;atisfied, except when it is exerci&s;ed to give or procure me plea&s;ure. I know not whe|ther the pa&s;&s;ion, which infu&s;es it&s;elf into all his words and actions that relate to me, ought to in&s;pire all that &s;ympathetic &s;en&s;ibility which he intends; but I own it &s;ometimes alarms me. His ardour is a&s;toni&s;hing. He &s;eems to wi&s;h, and even to de&s;ign, to make it irre&s;i&s;tible. Yet it is mingled with &s;uch exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s that I have half lo&s;t the power of repre&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not, no, I will not, &s;tand in awe of his impetuo&s;ity. Ardour is a
<PB N="212" REF="216">
noble quality, and my &s;tudy &s;hall be how to turn it to his advantage. The more I look round me the more I perceive that fear enfeebles, withers, and con|&s;umes the powers of mind. Tho&s;e who would nobly do mu&s;t nobly dare. Ra&s;h people, perhaps, are tho&s;e who feel the truth of this principle &s;o &s;trongly that they forget it is nece&s;&s;ary not only to dare, but to di&s;cover the be&s;t method of daring.</P>
<P>Clifton now avoids argument, and ap|pears &s;y&s;tematically determined to be of my opinion; or rather to &s;ay as I &s;ay. The only oppo&s;ition he affords is now and then a witty, &s;arca&s;tic, or humorous reply. But he is generally &s;ucce&s;sful in his continual attempts to give the con|ver&s;ation a new turn, when his favourite opinions are oppo&s;ed: for I do not think
<PB N="213" REF="217">
it wi&s;e to obtrude too many painful con|tradictions upon him at a time. Truth mu&s;t be progre&s;&s;ive. Like a fla&s;h of lightning, it &s;tuns or kills by exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Clifton will not long &s;uffer me to re&s;t, now we are returned; and con&s;equently my dear Loui&s;a may &s;oon expect another letter from her mo&s;t affectionate</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE have now been in London four days, Oliver; and, known places reviv|ing old ideas, it almo&s;t &s;eems as if we had never moved from the &s;pot where we are at pre&s;ent. I fall into the &s;ame trains of thinking; except that I am more re&s;tle&s;s, more inclined to melan|choly,
<PB N="215" REF="219">
to inaction, to a kind of inanity, which no trifling efforts can &s;hake off.</P>
<P>I have received thy letter, and find thy rea&s;oning in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;imilar to my own. I was a&s;hamed of remaining in doubt, on a que&s;tion which only re|quired a little extraordinary activity of mind to re&s;olve. It appears to me that nothing can be cla&s;&s;ed among fal&s;ehoods, except tho&s;e things the tendency of which is to generate fal&s;ehood, or mi&s;|take. Con&s;equently, not to tell what has pa&s;&s;ed to Clifton is acting according to the dictates of truth: for, to tell would be to run an imminent danger of fal&s;e conclu&s;ions. Not, it is true, if the whole could be told: that is, if all po&s;&s;i|ble rea&s;onings, and con&s;equences, could be fairly recollected, and &s;tated. But
<PB N="216" REF="220">
memory is fir&s;t to be feared; and &s;till more that prejudice which will not have the patience to lend mute attention. I therefore think, with thee, that &s;ilence in this ca&s;e is truth.</P>
<P>We have been in &s;ome danger, owing to the drunkenne&s;s of the Deal boatmen; but &s;aved our&s;elves by a little exertion. One of the poor inebriated wretches how|ever was lo&s;t. We &s;aw him only the in|&s;tant of his being wa&s;hed overboard; and he was hurried away into the &s;ea by the recoiling waves, in the roaring of which his la&s;t cry was overpowered, without our being able &s;o much as to at|tempt to give him aid! By which thou maye&s;t judge that we our&s;elves were in con&s;iderable jeopardy.</P>

to us, daily and hourly through life, we are apt to wonder that we &s;o continually e&s;cape. But, when we again con&s;ider how ea&s;ily even great dangers, that is &s;uch as take us by &s;urpri&s;e, may be warded off, the wonder cea&s;es.</P>
<P>My mind, Oliver, is not at ea&s;e: it is too much haunted by fear. At lea&s;t I hope it is; for my fears are for one whom it is almo&s;t torture to &s;uppo&s;e in peril. Thou never knewe&s;t &s;o enter|pri&s;ing, &s;o encroaching a youth as this Clifton! Nay I am deceived if encroach|ment be not reduced to &s;y&s;tem with him; and, &s;trong as her powers are, impo&s;&s;ible as I know it to be to &s;hake her princi|ples, yet, who can &s;ay what may happen, in a moment of forgetfulne&s;s, or mi&s;|take,
<PB N="218" REF="226">
to a heart &s;o pure, &s;o void of guile?</P>
<P>Such terrors are ridiculous, perhaps thou wilt &s;ay; and perhaps they are; at lea&s;t I mo&s;t devoutly hope they are. But his temperament is &s;anguine, his wi&s;hes re&s;tle&s;s, ungovernable, and I al|mo&s;t fear ominous, and his pa&s;&s;ion for her is already far beyond the controul of rea&s;on, to which indeed he thinks it ought not to be nor can be &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As for me, all is ended. Jealous I mu&s;t not, no, I will not be! And &s;urely I am above the meanne&s;s of envy. Yet I own, Oliver, I &s;ometimes blame her. I think her too precipitate, too fearle&s;s, nay too ready to imagine her power, her wondrous power, greater than it is.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="227">
She makes no &s;ecret of her thoughts, and &s;he tells me that &s;he and I, &s;he doubts not, &s;hall transform him to all that we our&s;elves could de&s;ire. Be not &s;ur|pri&s;ed at her kindne&s;s to me; for &s;he has a heart that is all benevolence, all friend&s;hip, all affection. If I can aid her, thou neede&s;t not doubt my will. But Heaven grant &s;he may not be mi&s;|taken!&mdash;Heaven grant it!</P>
<P>And yet, I cannot &s;ay. I even &s;ome|times hope and acquie&s;ce; for his talents are indeed extraordinary. But his pride, and the pitile&s;s revenge which he &s;hews a con&s;tant propen&s;ity to take, when of|fended, are dangerous &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>For her, &s;he &s;eems to act from motives wholly different from tho&s;e of her age
<PB N="220" REF="228">
and &s;ex. It is not pa&s;&s;ion, not love, &s;uch as it is u&s;ually felt and expre&s;&s;ed; it is a &s;en&s;e of duty, friend&s;hip for Loui&s;a, ad|miration of great talents, an ardent de|&s;ire to give tho&s;e talents their full value, and the dignified pride &s;he takes in re|&s;toring &s;uch a mind to its proper rank. By the&s;e &s;he is actuated, as all her words and actions demon&s;trate.</P>
<P>Well, well, Oliver! She &s;oars a flight that is more than mortal! But &s;he leaves a luminous track, that guides and in|vites, and I will attempt to follow. Thou &s;halt &s;ee me ri&s;e above the poor &s;lavi&s;h wi&s;hes that would chain me to earth!&mdash;</P>
<P>Oliver, my mind, like a bow continu|ally bent, is too much upon the &s;tretch. Such is the effect of my &s;ituation, of
<PB N="221" REF="229">
which my thoughts, my language, and my actions partake. But I will calm this agitation. Fear not: thou &s;halt find me worthy to be thy friend, and the pupil of thy mo&s;t excellent father.</P>
<P>No! I will not, Oliver, be a child; though the conte&s;t be indeed &s;evere. By day I am with her; for hours I li&s;ten, while &s;he &s;ings, or plays, or &s;peaks. I am a witne&s;s of her actions! Her form is never ab&s;ent from me! The &s;ound of her voice is uncea&s;ing har|mony to my ears! At night, retiring to darkne&s;s and thought, I pa&s;s her cham|ber door! In the morning again I be|hold the place where all that is heavenly re&s;ts! I endeavour after apathy. I la|bour to be &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;tupid, an idiot! I

<P>Indeed, Oliver, this weakne&s;s is mo|mentary! Indeed it is&mdash;Fear not: thou &s;halt find me a man; be a&s;&s;ured thou &s;halt. Though the furies, or, wor&s;e than all that invention can feign, the pa&s;&s;ions throng to a&s;&s;ault me, I will neither fly nor yield.

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR brother has gained his point. The deed is done. My con&s;ent is given. For, in reality, to have with|held it would have had more the appear|ance of a coquette than of the friend of my Loui&s;a. After &s;ufficiently &s;trong hints in the cour&s;e of the two fir&s;t days,
<PB N="225" REF="233">
on the third after our arrival, Clifton came. His intention was evidently to take no denial. It was with difficulty that I could bring him to li&s;ten, for a few minutes, while I repeated principles before declared, and required an avowal of how far he thought them an impedi|ment to future happine&s;s. To every thing I could a&s;k he was ready to ac|cede. <Q>He had nothing to contend, nothing to contradict; and, if he did not think exactly like me in every particular, he was determined not to think at all, till he could. Be&s;ide, my own conclu&s;ions, in favour of truth, were my &s;afeguard. I had not any doubt that rea&s;on, if attended to, mu&s;t finally prevail; and I could not deny that he was at all times ready to pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="234">
Indeed he &s;eemed at fir&s;t re&s;olved, as it were, not to enter into any conver&s;a|tion, but to claim my promi&s;e. But I was &s;till more determined to exert my|&s;elf; that the due influence which rea|&s;on ought always to have, over pa&s;&s;ion, might not be lo&s;t, and &s;ink into habitual and timid conce&s;&s;ion. When he per|ceived there was no re&s;i&s;ting, he then li&s;tened with a tolerably good grace; but &s;till, as I &s;aid, with an apparently pre|concerted plan not to contend; urging, and indeed truly, that fair arguments could de&s;ire nothing more than patient hearing; and this he pledged, in his energetic and half wild manner, honour, body, and &s;oul to give. I could not de|&s;ire more &s;incere a&s;&s;everations than he made; and that they were &s;incere I cannot doubt. Nor do I regret that they
<PB N="227" REF="235">
were &s;trong. Where there is energy there is the material of which mind is fa&s;hioned: and the fault mu&s;t be mine, if the work be incomplete. Our con|ver&s;ation however was long; and when at la&s;t obliged to enter into the &s;ubject, the acutene&s;s and depth of his remarks were &s;trong proof of his powers, had any proof been wanting&mdash;Yes, Loui&s;a, the attempt mu&s;t be made. It is a high and indi&s;pen&s;able duty; and I mu&s;t neither be deterred by the dread of dan|ger, nor &s;wayed by the too &s;educing emo|tions of the heart&mdash;They mu&s;t be &s;i|lenced!&mdash;They mu&s;t!</P>
<P>I have an a&s;&s;i&s;tant worthy of the cau&s;e. Frank does not &s;hrink from the ta&s;k: though it is but too evident that he has not changed his opinion! I know not why, but &s;o it is, tho&s;e two particular
<PB N="228" REF="236">
&s;entences continually reverberate in my ear<HI>&mdash;I feel a certainty of conviction, that you act from mi&s;taken principles&mdash;To the end of time I &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in thinking you mine by right!&mdash;</HI>Oh, Loui&s;a!</P>
<P>Sir Arthur of cour&s;e made no difficulty in giving his con&s;ent; and I imagine Mrs. Clifton will this po&s;t receive a let|ter from her &s;on, and perhaps another from my father, requiring her acquie&s;|cence.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur has &s;hewn me one of the mo&s;t &s;trange, eccentric, and perhaps co|mic letters, from <HI>hone&s;t Aby,</HI> that I think I ever read. I am glad it is not quite &s;o intelligible to Sir Arthur as it is to me; for I &s;ee no good that could re&s;ult, were he to under&s;tand its true &s;en&s;e. The old&mdash;! I can find no epithet for him that plea&s;es me&mdash;Well then<HI>&mdash;Hone&s;t</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="237">
<HI>Aby</HI> is exce&s;&s;ively anxious that I &s;hould marry a &s;on of whom he is &s;o unworthy. But his motives are &s;o mean, &s;o whim&s;i|cal, and &s;o oddly compounded and de|&s;cribed, peering as it were through the ma&s;k of cunning, with which he awk|wardly endeavours to conceal them, that nothing but reading his letter can give you an idea of its characteri&s;tic humour. This po&s;t I &s;uppo&s;e will likewi&s;e &s;hew him his mi&s;take. How he will receive the news I know not; though I &s;u&s;pect he will rai&s;e ob&s;tacles, concerning the money which Sir Arthur wants, in order to pay my portion. But this will &s;oon be &s;een.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e learn, from his letter, that my brother is to join in docking the en|tail of the hereditary e&s;tate; and that he is willing, provided he may &s;hare the
<PB N="230" REF="238">
&s;poil. How would my heart bleed, were I not cured of that prejudice which makes happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t in the per&s;onal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth! But the &s;y&s;tem of tyranny would be more firm and durable even than it is, did not this mutation of property daily exi&s;t; and were not the old and honourable families, as they call them&s;elves, brought to ruin by their fooli&s;h and truly di&s;honourable de&s;cen|dants.</P>
<P>Every thing confirms me in the &s;u&s;pi|cion that hone&s;t Aby has been playing a deep game; and that both Sir Arthur and my brother have ceded to all the ex|tortions of craft and u&s;ury, to have their whims and extravagancies &s;upplied.</P>
<P>My brother per&s;uades him&s;elf that he is determined never to marry; and I &s;uppo&s;e has formed this determination
<PB N="231" REF="239">
purpo&s;ely that he may &s;pend all he can obtain, without being tea&s;ed by any qualms of con&s;cience. For the de&s;truc|tive &s;y&s;tem of individual property in|volves a thou&s;and ab&s;urdities; and the proud but inane &s;ucce&s;&s;or of a Sydney or a Verulam, in&s;tead of knowing how difficult the &s;ubject of identity it&s;elf is, in&s;tead of perceiving that man is nothing but a continuity, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of &s;ingle thoughts, and is therefore in reality no more than the thought of the moment, believes there is a &s;table and indubitable affinity between him and his great an|ce&s;tor.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now be more than ever deter|mined to accompli&s;h the ta&s;k I have un|dertaken; and to give to the arms of my be&s;t, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, a brother worthy of a heart &s;o pure, and a &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="232" REF="240">
&s;uch as &s;he her&s;elf could wi&s;h to be that brother's other half&mdash;Very true, Lou|i&s;a! It is the old &s;tory: I am Sir Ar|thur's vapouring hu&s;&s;ey! But I comfort my&s;elf with reflecting that, after the bat|tle is won, the ra&s;hne&s;s of the attack is never remembered; or, if it be, it is al|ways applauded; and that all generals, great or &s;mall, confide in their own plans, till defeat has proved them to be abor|tive. Something mu&s;t be ventured, ere any thing can be won.</P>
<P>Not knowing what might be the no|tions of Sir Arthur, or even of Mrs. Clifton, concerning the &s;ilence they might think it nece&s;&s;ary to keep, I for|bore to mention their plan, of which my friend, with her con&s;i&s;tent frankne&s;s, in|formed me, till our la&s;t conference: but I then thought it an indi&s;pen&s;able duty
<PB N="233" REF="241">
to relate the truth; otherwi&s;e it might have come, at &s;ome unlucky moment, in the di&s;gui&s;e of fal&s;ehood, and have done mi&s;chief. Secrets are indeed ab|&s;olutely contrary to my &s;y&s;tem. 'Tis pride or fal&s;e &s;hame that puts blinds to the windows either of the hou&s;e or of the mind. Let the whole world look in, and &s;ee what is doing; that if any thing be wrong, it may have an opportunity to reprove; and whatever is right there is &s;ome hope it may imitate. Clifton was plea&s;ed to find him&s;elf treated with un|di&s;gui&s;ed &s;incerity. Yes, Loui&s;a, fear not: you will find him your brother, in virtue as well as in blood.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR plan has &s;ucceeded to our wi&s;h: Mr. Clifton is as I may &s;ay quite &s;mitten with my daughter. And indeed I do not wonder at it; for, though &s;he is my child, I mu&s;t &s;ay, &s;he is the &s;weete&s;t, mo&s;t charming, lovely girl I

I have a true fatherly fondne&s;s for her; and, though I own it will not be very convenient to me, I mean imme|diately to rai&s;e twenty thou&s;and pounds, to pay down as her portion. If at my death I &s;hould have the power to do more, &s;he &s;hall not be forgotten: but I promi&s;e nothing.</P>
<P>As I remember, dear madam, this was the &s;um which you &s;aid was nece&s;&s;ary, to redeem certain mortgages, pay off en|cumbrances, and enable Mr. Clifton to appear in England, in a manner be|coming the heir of the Clifton family. And this &s;um I think it very fit the daughter of Sir Arthur St. Ives &s;hould receive. I &s;hall accordingly write to my agent, and put every thing immediately
<PB N="236" REF="244">
in train; after which, you &s;hall hear from me without delay.</P>
<P>If any alteration &s;hould have happen|ed in your own views, or affairs, which may impede or forward our plan, you will be kind enough to inform me.</P>

<P>I WRITE to you, dear and honoured madam, with a grateful and happy heart, to thank you for a project &s;o maternally and wi&s;ely conceived in my favour, and of which I have ju&s;t been informed, by the frank-hearted and lovely Anna St. Ives. Of all the ble&s;&s;ings for which,
<PB N="238" REF="246">
madam, I hold my&s;elf indebted to you, this la&s;t, of di&s;covering and endeavouring to &s;ecure for your thankful &s;on a gem &s;o precious, a lady &s;o above all prai&s;e, I e&s;teem to be the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>You, dear madam, are acquainted with the propriety with which &s;he thinks and acts, on every occa&s;ion; and I have no doubt will join with me, in applauding the entire undi&s;gui&s;edne&s;s of relating all that had pa&s;&s;ed, which appeared to her delicate mind at this moment to be ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>After obtaining her con&s;ent for that purpo&s;e, I have &s;poken to Sir Arthur; who, at my reque&s;t, has promi&s;ed imme|diately to write to you. And, it being a project, dear madam, a kind one, of your own forming, I have no fear that it &s;hould
<PB N="239" REF="247">
be di&s;countenanced by you. My only doubt is of delay. Let me entreat you, my dear mother, to remove all impedi|ments with every po&s;&s;ible &s;peed; and not to lo&s;e a moment in writing to me, as &s;oon as you and Sir Arthur have arranged the bu&s;ine&s;s, that I may &s;olicit her, from whom I am certain to receive all po&s;&s;ible bli&s;s, to name a time, when &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;hall joyfully end.</P>
<P>Do not, dear madam, let impatience &s;eem a fault in me. Remember the lady; who &s;he is, and all &s;he is; and think, if her perfections could make the impre&s;|&s;ion which they &s;eem to have done upon your heart, what mu&s;t they have made upon mine!

con&s;equence of your own wi&s;e plan, am become a wi&s;hing and expecting lover!</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, I am &s;ure, is too generous, the happine&s;s of her friend and brother being pledged, not to join me in the re|que&s;t I now make: and I certainly will not forget a kindne&s;s which, I acknow|ledge, I know not how I &s;hall ever repay.</P>
