<P>MY Orlando has been ill, my dear Harriot, yes he has been ill, and his I&s;abella at a cruel di&s;tance from him, he tells me he is nearly recovered; but dare I
<PB N="12" REF="13">
flatter my&s;elf he does not deceive me <HI>now,</HI> as he has <HI>kindly</HI> done all the time he has been confined?&mdash;kindly the dear creatures intentions were, I well know; and yet I can hardly forgive the well meant de&s;|ception, &s;ince I now reproach my|&s;elf for having been &s;o chearful, while he was perhaps in danger&mdash;he tells me he would &s;till have kept me a &s;tranger to it, could he have contrived any other rea&s;on to give me for his not returning im|mediately to England; but a&s;&s;ures me, though not yet able to bear the fatigue of the journey, he is out of all po&s;&s;ible danger, it &s;eems
<PB N="13" REF="14">
he caught a fever from a gentle|man, who lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, who is now, how|ever, perfectly well.</P>
<P>This per&s;on is a mo&s;t agreeable young man, who is going on a tour to the South of France, and has almo&s;t tempted my brother to accompany him, if he &s;hould be prevailed upon, it will detain him from me about two months longer, and I rather think by what he &s;ays, he will comply, for I find he has got a farther leave of his ab|&s;ence from his worthy general, who recommends the plan, as it
<PB N="14" REF="15">
will not only &s;erve to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his health; but al&s;o give him an opportunity of &s;eeing that part of the world, which is well worth his notice&mdash;all this convinces me the thing is re&s;olved on, yet I am per|&s;uaded, were I to expre&s;s a wi&s;h for his return, he would indulge me; but for this very rea&s;on, I have pre&s;&s;ed the contrary, indeed I am of the general's opinion, and were I not, I love him too well, not to prefer his &s;atisfaction to my own at any time.</P>
<P>Sir John, I hear, left London la&s;t week, and is in a fair way of
<PB N="15" REF="16">
recovery&mdash;that circum&s;tance is &s;o important, that I &s;hould have been the happie&s;t creature in the world, had I not now a thou&s;and ap|prehen&s;ions on my Orlando's ac|count; however, if his next letter informs me he is actually &s;et out on his tour, I &s;hall be tolerably ea&s;y, as that will be a proof that <HI>he is</HI> better&mdash;for that letter, you may well believe I am impatient, beyond expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;and now a word or two of my new neighbour.</P>
<P>You'll plea&s;e to recollect 'tis near a fortnight &s;ince he came here; I mention this, le&s;t you &s;hould wonder to find he has con|trived
<PB N="16" REF="17">
to be introduced to me, though Lord Templeton could not.&mdash;&s;ee what it is for a man to be pa&s;&s;ed the age of gallantry, they have many advantages&mdash;yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e who are not, may not envy them.</P>
<P>It &s;eems Mr. Douglas, for that is my new friends name, had heard me warbling to my harp&s;ichord&mdash;of cour&s;e a&s;ked Mrs. Bellmour who it was, to whom he was in|debted for being &s;o highly enter|tained, as he politely termed it&mdash;to him &s;he thought no re&s;erve nece&s;&s;ary, but freely acquainted him with my &s;ituation&mdash;hone&s;tly owning
<PB N="17" REF="18">
to me, &s;he thought a man of his age, a &s;ingle man too, and im|men&s;ely rich, might be a de&s;irable friend, this it &s;eems was her kind motive for &s;o fully gratifying his curio&s;ity&mdash;&s;he wi&s;hed to tell him my real name too, as he might po&s;&s;ibly have known &s;ome of my family, but would not pre&s;ume to do it without my permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I thanked her for her attention, &s;aying &s;he had acted with her u&s;ual propriety; that as to my name, it was of little con&s;equence, &s;ince I had taken that of Beverly, I would even continue it till my brother's return.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">
Mrs. Bellmour, it &s;eems, &s;aid &s;o many fine things in my prai&s;e, that the old gentlemen ex|pre&s;&s;ed a violent de&s;ire to &s;ee me, that he might him&s;elf judge whether I de&s;erved them&mdash;in &s;hort, &s;he beg|ged me to honor her with my com|pany at tea, a few days after his arrival, and there I met him, not by &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;hould tell you, for &s;he had a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion for that al&s;o&mdash;if he was charmed with me, I do a&s;&s;ure you I was no le&s;s &s;o with him&mdash;how &s;o delightful a man could &s;o long continue a batchelor, Heaven knows!&mdash;cro&s;&s;ed in love, I &s;uppo&s;e, Harriot&mdash;not

<P>Mrs. Bellmour, who I believe is &s;in|cerely attached to me, has often re|greted that lord Templeton had not an opportunity of being introduced to me, as he bears &s;o excellent a character, and as &s;he is certain I could not fail to be partial to him on a farther acquaintance, &s;he

wants to a&s;k Mr. Douglas whether he knows him&mdash;I bid her have patience, time is a worker of miracles&mdash;his lord&s;hip is certainly uncommonly hand&s;ome I tell her; but it by no means follows, I &s;hould prefer him to all others, merely on that account, this &s;he allows; but adds, he is univer&s;ally reckoned the mo&s;t amiable, and accompli&s;hed man in England, and is certain we are formed for each other&mdash;<HI>if &s;o,</HI> I reply, we &s;hall cer|tainly manage the bu&s;ine&s;s with|out interference.</P>
<P>I find Harriot, his lord&s;hip has contrived to gain <HI>her</HI> good graces

mo&s;t completely, and I believe &s;he now wi&s;hes I would be a little le&s;s&mdash;I will not &s;ay prudent&mdash;but in &s;hort, le&s;s re&s;erved&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t, however excu&s;e me, I cannot pre|vail upon my&s;elf to <HI>&s;toop to conquer,</HI> a proper pride, my dear, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to man and woman too.</P>

<P>THE plot begins to thicken, as &s;omebody &s;ays, Har|riot&mdash;Lord Templeton, has ac|tually, by &s;ome means got ac|quainted with my worthy friend Mr. Douglas&mdash;'tis ab&s;olutely a
<PB N="24" REF="25">
fact my dear: here follows what pa&s;&s;ed between us this morning on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I had been playing a le&s;&s;on to Mr. Douglas on the harp&s;ichord, and afterwards, at his de&s;ire &s;ung&mdash;in love to pine and langui&s;h, yet know my pa&s;&s;ion vain, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, then he &s;miling, cried, and can you my dear young lady give &s;o much &s;weet expre&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e lines; yet be the cruel, the hard hearted creature I am told you are?&mdash;Harriot, I thought I &s;hould have
<PB N="25" REF="26">
expired with confu&s;ion&mdash;I expected the next moment to &s;ee him pop down on his knees at my feet&mdash;what el&s;e could I think after this &s;peech, but a pa&s;&s;ionate declaration of love?&mdash;I now wi&s;hed the in&s;tru|ment at Jeru&s;alem, that had been the means of bringing me into &s;uch a &s;crape&mdash;he &s;aw my embar|ra&s;&s;ment, and I have not a doubt, gue&s;&s;ed my thoughts.</P>
<P>Pray &s;aid I, at la&s;t, who is the enemy, who gives me a character, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;o little de&s;erve?&mdash;and have you then no idea, who it can be, replied he? is your con|&s;cience, my dear Mi&s;s Beverly <HI>quite</HI>

at ea&s;e? yes, upon my word it is returned, I (ga&s;ping for breath)&mdash;and your heart too? both I a&s;&s;ure you&mdash;why then, (cried he, affecting to look wondrous grave) poor Lord Templeton may as well put an end to his torments, by tucking him&s;elf up on the fir&s;t friendly willow he can meet with.</P>
<P>Lord Templeton! exclaimed I with amazement, good Heavens! Mr. Douglas, what can you mean?&mdash;Oh, ho! cried he, I have found you out, my lovely young friend, have I? I thought I &s;hould bring you in guilty before I had done&mdash;upon my honor, (looking exceed|ingly
<PB N="27" REF="28">
&s;illy I believe) I never &s;aw his lord&s;hip but once in my life, he is ab&s;olutely a &s;tranger to me.</P>
<P>I know it Mi&s;s Beverly, I know it, and that is the very identical cau&s;e of tho&s;e torments I was talking of, and of which he &s;o much complains&mdash;he too &s;aw <HI>you</HI> once, and &s;trange to tell has been blind, ab|&s;olutely blind to the charms of every other woman, from that moment.</P>
<P>But how, in the name of fortune came you &s;ir to know all this, &s;uppo&s;ing it true, which I have not the vanity to think

<P>Some days after this friend&s;hip was &s;truck up between us, which to be &s;ure tickled my vanity not a little&mdash;he begun to <HI>let it down</HI> gra|dually, by convincing me <HI>I</HI> was not the only object of his attach|ment, for he a&s;ked if I had ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">een &s;o fortunate as to &s;ee Mi&s;s

I have not, till I had the good for|tune to meet with you, been able to find any per&s;on of her ac|quaintance.&mdash;Mrs. Bellmour has been deaf to all my &s;olicitations, and mi&s;erable as it has made me, I e&s;teem her the more for it; now my dear Sir, if you on a farther knowledge of my character, can procure me this honor, I &s;hall look upon it as the greate&s;t obli|gation you can po&s;&s;ibly confer&mdash;my happine&s;s, my peace of mind depend upon your indulging me in my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Now Mi&s;s Beverly, &s;aid Mr. Douglas, I have done&mdash;thus much,

this in&s;inuating <HI>friend</HI> of mine prevailed upon me to promi&s;e, I complied with le&s;s reluctance; be|cau&s;e I have, to tell you the truth, conceived a very good opinion of him, though that alone would not have &s;ufficed; one may be de|ceived by appearances, but I have made it my particular bu&s;ine&s;s to know his character from others, and find it all I could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>What can I &s;ay Sir? replied I, his Lord&s;hip certainly does me a great deal of honor, but &s;ituated as I am at pre&s;ent, I cannot according to my ideas of rectitude think of receiving his vi&s;its&mdash;I cannot in|deed,

<P>Nay, nay, if you go on at that rate I &s;hall be in love with you my&s;elf, and there will be an end of his lord&s;hip's hopes at once.&mdash;What?&mdash;you pretend to tell me you have not &s;ixpence in the world, yet, &s;cruple to break through the forms of decorum, at the hazard of lo&s;ing the affection of a man, who is dying to make you mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch a fortune as might amply gra|tify the ambition of any woman in

<P>Is he not a delightful old man, Harriot?

<P>And pray, Sir, give him to under|&s;tand I am not as he may perhaps fancy, a woman offortune. I wi&s;h not to deceive him, this in|formation may po&s;&s;ibly prove as effectual a remedy as the lover's leap.&mdash;I &s;hall tell him no &s;uch thing, for you know nothing of the matter; how &s;hould <HI>you</HI> know what you are worth? Nay, my dear Sir,&mdash;and nay, my dear Ma|dam,&mdash;I have lived longer in the world than you, and could tell you a thou&s;and &s;tranger things than that&mdash;but adieu.&mdash;I am going

<P>DO you know Harriot, I have met with the greate&s;t &s;hock &s;ince my la&s;t that ever I received in my life? or hope ever &s;hall again. I am &s;till &s;o fluttered by it, though
<PB N="45" REF="46">
it happened ye&s;terday, that I can hardly guide my pen&mdash;it has ab&s;o|lutely affected my nerves&mdash;no, ne|ver was &s;o <HI>in&s;olent,</HI> &s;o de&s;picable a creature.</P>
<P>I was &s;itting in my room ye&s;ter|day morning, enjoying a letter I had ju&s;t received from my dear Orlando (who by the way is per|fectly recovered, and &s;et off on the tour I mentioned,) when my door opened, and without ceremony in flounced&mdash;gue&s;s who?&mdash;only Lady Beningfield; I ro&s;e from my &s;eat at her entrance, not at that in&s;tant recollecting her, and was of cour&s;e, though &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a &s;tranger,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
going to receive her politely, but her behaviour &s;oon brought her to my remembrance, and al&s;o account|ed for the <HI>honor</HI> &s;he did me, &s;eeing plainly &s;he came with no friendly de&s;ign, I very compo&s;edly re&s;umed my &s;eat, leaving her lady&s;hip to find one for her&s;elf, in ca&s;e &s;he cho&s;e to follow my example.&mdash;</P>
<P>This I &s;aw piqued her mo&s;t hor|ridly; fine airs, Mi&s;s you give your&s;elf upon my word, methinks you might treat a per&s;on of my rank (and &s;he bridled) with a little more ceremony&mdash;had your rank been pro|perly announced to me, before you thought fit thus to intrude your|&s;elf
<PB N="47" REF="48">
into my apartment, perhaps I &s;hould have paid more attention to it; though your behaviour would &s;oon have de&s;troyed any degree of re&s;pect <HI>that</HI> rank might have in|&s;pired,&mdash;in&s;olent, but 'tis no won|der your &s;illy head &s;hould be turned&mdash;&s;he was &s;o violently agitated that &s;he could not proceed; I on the contrary felt &s;o much contempt for her, that I was more compo&s;ed then, than I am now while giving you an account of it.&mdash;Pray Ma|dam, may I pre&s;ume to a&s;k, &s;aid I, how I came to be honored with your very agreeable company? I really have not the happine&s;s of being
<PB N="48" REF="49">
in the lea&s;t acquainted with you, and con&s;equently am rather at a lo&s;s</P>
<P><HI>Acquainted</HI> with me! cried &s;he with a &s;neer, no, really, <HI>my</HI> ac|quaintance I would have you to know are in a very different line of life&mdash;and to make a little variety I pre&s;ume Madam, you wi&s;h to add me to the number.&mdash;Do not attempt to be witty child, I &s;hall be &s;ick of it&mdash;I &s;hould be &s;orry for that, &s;aid I, &s;ince your being ill might be a means to prolong your vi&s;it.&mdash;Don't be impertinent young wo|man, that may be &s;till wor&s;e. Sup|po&s;e then, and [by this time Har|riot, I had taken up a pur&s;e I am
<PB N="49" REF="50">
netting, and began to work] &s;up|po&s;e then we wave all farther cere|mony, Madam, and come to the point,&mdash;once more permit me to a&s;k what has procured me the ho|nor of this vi&s;it?</P>
<P>Why, then without <HI>farther cere|mony Mi&s;s,</HI> I &s;hould be glad to know what footing you are upon with Lord Templeton? I am not to learn that he has taken &s;ome pains to make you believe a thou&s;and mo&s;t ab&s;urd and ridiculous things; I have very particular rea&s;ons for making this enquiry; you cannot &s;urely be &s;uch a fool as to fancy he has any
<PB N="50" REF="51">
thoughts of marrying you&mdash;that is out of the que&s;tion: now had you been wi&s;e enough to have treated me with that deference I have a right to, I meant to have made you a very friendly offer; fir&s;t, however, let me know what it is you really expect from him.</P>
<P>Allow me fir&s;t, &s;aid I, with a&s;toni&s;hing calmne&s;s, to tell you madam what I expect from <HI>you</HI> (ri&s;ing and going to the door) which is, that you will be kind enough to find your way down &s;tairs, as you found the way up.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">
I really thought the creature would have beat me, Harriot&mdash;how dare you, cried &s;he (choking with rage) pre&s;ume to treat a per&s;on of my quality with this unheard of in&s;olence?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, returned I, that <HI>feather quality</HI> on which <HI>you</HI> very ju&s;tly &s;et &s;o high a value, con&s;cious you have nothing el&s;e to boa&s;t of, <HI>I</HI> pay no &s;ort of regard to, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a being, I have rea&s;on to look down upon with con|tempt.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, I very quietly walked into the next room, turned the
<PB N="52" REF="53">
key of the door, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould think proper to follow me, and left her to her own meditations&mdash;&s;he did indeed attempt it, but find|ing I had put it out of her power, I heard her march down &s;tairs, muttering, I know not what as &s;he went.</P>
<P>Now my dear Harriot, what &s;ay you to this plea&s;ant adventure? I pre&s;ume the friendly offer &s;he kindly meant to make me, was the do&s;e of poi&s;on you once men|tioned&mdash;&s;hall I confe&s;s, that I no &s;ooner heard the creatures carriage drive from the door, than I was
<PB N="53" REF="54">
&s;imple enough to bur&s;t into tears?&mdash;&s;imple I &s;ay, &s;ince &s;o de&s;picable a being was certainly beneath my notice; but though pride kept up my &s;pirits while &s;he was pre&s;ent, they intirely for&s;ook me, when left to reflect on the mortifying &s;cene.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf relieved by them however, and as &s;oon as my eyes were fit to be &s;een, I rung for my maid, de&s;iring &s;he would ac|quaint Mrs. Bellmour, I wi&s;hed to &s;ee her&mdash;&s;he returned, telling me, &s;he had been out all the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
I now &s;ent her to a&s;k, who had &s;hewn Lady Beningfield up &s;tairs, and to my a&s;toni&s;hment, found no mortal below, knew &s;he had been with me till they &s;aw her coming down; &s;he had a&s;ked, indeed, if I was at home, on her fir&s;t en|tering the hou&s;e, but &s;aid no more about it, and when they would have attended her to the door, &s;he would not permit any one to take that trouble; &s;aying, her &s;er|vant was waiting, &s;hut the par|lour door, and in&s;tead of going out, as they &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;&s;he &s;lipped up &s;tairs.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">
This is the account the young woman gave my Sally&mdash;I took no farther notice of it to any of them, but mentioned what had pa&s;&s;ed to Mrs. Bellmour, when &s;he returned, who was &s;hocked beyond expre&s;&s;ion, declaring &s;he &s;hould never &s;et her foot in her doors again, let what would be the con&s;equence&mdash;to this I objected, as &s;he was &s;o good a cu&s;tomer&mdash;but in vain&mdash;&s;he vowed, &s;he never with her con&s;ent &s;hould gain admittance.</P>
<P>I am really a&s;toni&s;hed how I had courage to bear her in&s;olence with &s;o much calmne&s;s; but re|joice
<PB N="56" REF="57">
mo&s;t truly, that I had &s;o much command of my&s;elf, as I certainly mortified her, even more than &s;he mortified me&mdash;con&s;cious of my innocence, it was but a momentary pain, while her lady|&s;hip mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible &s;he had ren|dered her&s;elf an object of con|tempt, even in her own eyes.</P>
<P>I long much to know, whether lord Templeton has heard of it&mdash;ten to one, if the fooli&s;h, in&s;ignifi|cant woman has prudence enough to conceal the &s;tory, though it mu&s;t &s;et her in &s;o de&s;picable a point of view.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
If they have differed (which I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect, or why &s;hould &s;he have acted in that ab&s;urd man|ner?) I make no doubt &s;he will inform him, in order to di&s;tract him, which it cannot, I think fail to do, if he has any &s;entimentals of delicacy.</P>
<P>I have de&s;ired Mrs. Bellmour to conceal the affair from my worthy friend Mr. Douglas, it hurts my pride, my feelings&punc; Harriot, though I have certainly no cau&s;e to blu&s;h, whatever her lady&s;hip may have; but as he is now my lords <HI>con|fident,</HI> he may chance to hear the &s;tory from him.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
This, my dear Harriot, is the fir&s;t occa&s;ion on which I have <HI>&s;everely felt</HI> the change in my &s;ituation&mdash;but for that change, this could not have happened&mdash;I tru&s;t and hope it will be al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>

<P>IT is, as I gue&s;&s;ed, Harriot&mdash;my lord is di&s;tracted at what has happened&mdash;I have had the whole hi&s;tory from Mr. Douglas, and a letter on the &s;ubject from his lord|&s;hip, which I was compelled to
<PB N="60" REF="61">
receive contrary to my inclinations; but what could I do? my worthy friend (for &s;uch I really believe he is) was rather hurt at my attempt|ing to decline it, as it was cer|tainly condemning <HI>him</HI> for con|&s;enting to convey it to me&mdash;I &s;aw he was chagrined, and therefore, though unwillingly, took it from him; I will inclo&s;e a copy for your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>I fear this may bring on a corre&s;|pondence, which I really wi&s;hed exceedingly to avoid till my bro|ther's return, his dear pre&s;ence would have &s;aved me from all
<PB N="61" REF="62">
this unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;but there's no help for it, I mu&s;t be doubly watchful over my conduct, that's all I can now do.</P>
<P>Mr. Douglas, who has &s;eriou&s;ly conceived a real friend&s;hip, for his lord&s;hip declares, he is the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, the mo&s;t engaging young man he ever met with, gave me the following particulars of the affair ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Their meetings are no longer confined to the coffee-hou&s;e, on the contrary, they are &s;eldom a&s;under; he called upon his lord|&s;hip,
<PB N="62" REF="63">
it &s;eems, in the morning, and to his a&s;toni&s;hment found him almo&s;t frantic&mdash;for Heaven's &s;ake! cried he, what has thus di&s;turbed you my lord.</P>
<P>My dear friend, replied his lord|&s;hip, you &s;ee before you the mo&s;t wretched of men&mdash;<HI>what again</HI> my Lord&mdash;Oh! &s;pare your railery, I am really mi&s;erable beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion; have you then heard no|thing, has the charming Mi&s;s Be|verly concealed from <HI>you</HI> the un|pardonable, the cruel in&s;ult &s;he has meet with on my account?&mdash;Oh! Mr. Douglas, &s;he never, <HI>never</HI> can
<PB N="63" REF="64">
forgive it!&mdash;'tis impo&s;&s;ible, every hope, every glimmering of hope is now lo&s;t to me for ever!&mdash;prithee explain your &s;elf, &s;aid my good friend, in the name of fortune, what have you done, how have you in|&s;ulted, how been guilty of this <HI>unpardonable</HI> offence?</P>
<P><HI>I!</HI> exclaimed his lord&s;hip&mdash;<HI>I</HI> in&s;ult the mo&s;t lovely of women!&mdash;Ah! Heaven forbid!&mdash;why then all this di&s;traction, if 'tis not you?&mdash;I tell you I am the fatal cau&s;e, and is not that to be completely wretched?</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">
Not quite replied Mr. Douglas, in his dry way&mdash;your lord&s;hip may be the <HI>innocent</HI> cau&s;e, and &s;urely that alters the ca&s;e, but come&mdash;let me hear the whole &s;tory, that I may be the better able to judge, whether 'tis time for you to hang or drown your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Allow me Harriot to make this part of the hi&s;tory as &s;hort as I can, becau&s;e you already know the &s;ub&s;tance of it, I mean her lady&s;hip's pa&s;&s;ion for Lord Tem|pleton&mdash;&s;u&s;pecting from the fir&s;t time of his &s;eeing me, that I had made an impre&s;&s;ion on a heart &s;he
<PB N="65" REF="66">
wi&s;hed to have wholly to her|&s;elf, &s;he had him watched, and &s;oon learned he made frequent vi&s;its to Mrs. Bellmour&mdash;at fir&s;t &s;he rallied him; but finding this had no effect, &s;he called him <HI>fal&s;e, perfidious</HI> and <HI>ungrateful,</HI> in fine, ranted like any tragedy queen&mdash;he pleaded not guily&mdash;<HI>&s;he</HI> finding no better might be pleaded the <HI>violence of her love,</HI> very plea&s;ant that Har|riot&mdash;he returned a mo&s;t graceful bow&mdash;what could a man do more?</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;he in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould &s;wear her &s;u&s;picions were without foundation&mdash;he prote&s;ted he was
<PB N="66" REF="67">
not &s;ufficiently acquainted with either the nature or extent of her &s;u&s;picions, and begged to decline obliging her&mdash;&s;he raved&mdash;he looked, I &s;uppo&s;e as every man mu&s;t na|turally do, who finds a woman making love to <HI>him,</HI> in&s;tead of his making love to her&mdash;that is to &s;ay rather aukward&mdash;finding &s;he could not move his flinty heart, &s;he vowed &s;he would go in per&s;on to the creature who had robbed her of it, and know from her&s;elf what &s;oot|ing we were upon.</P>
<P>This threat, which he well knew &s;he was capable of putting
<PB N="67" REF="68">
into execution, alarmed him;&mdash;he &s;wore to expo&s;e her conduct to the whole world, if &s;he pre&s;umed to entertain an idea of that horrid nature.&mdash;She valued not the world, was her reply, having lo&s;t all &s;he held dear in it:&mdash;he now con|de&s;cended to &s;ooth, to intreat; but this exa&s;perated her the more, &s;en&s;ible it was for my &s;ake, not her own.</P>
<P>They parted with mutual di&s;gu&s;t, he &s;till flattering him&s;elf &s;he would not &s;toop to &s;uch meanne&s;s&mdash;but to his utter confu&s;ion, &s;he informed him of what &s;he had done, glory|ing
<PB N="68" REF="69">
in the di&s;tre&s;s &s;he had cau&s;ed, and vowing it &s;hould not be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>And now, &s;aid his lord&s;hip, (hav|ing ended his &s;tory) What have I to hope?&mdash;Why, for the felicity of throwing your&s;elf at Mi&s;s Be|verly's feet, my lord, cried Mr. Dou|glas, the very fir&s;t opportunity, and making your peace the be&s;t way you can.&mdash;Were &s;he indeed a be|ing ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould with the <HI>gentle creature</HI> we have been talking of, I &s;hould advi&s;e you to take a <HI>cordial drop,</HI> by way of &s;av|ing her the trouble of admini&s;tering

it, which &s;he certainly, in that ca&s;e, would contrive to do; but as &s;he is not, I recommend the fir&s;t plan as the mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P>Ah!&mdash;cried my lord&mdash;would to heaven I dur&s;t flatter my&s;elf with the hopes that &s;he would conde+&s;cend to hear my defence&punc; but if even you, my dear Sir, could not prevail upon her to admit me to her pre&s;ence, before this cur&s;ed affair, how can I now expect it?&mdash;impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;then after a pau&s;e, he added&mdash;perhaps, Mr. Douglas, you may have influence enough with the dear and ju&s;tly incen&s;ed

<P>He in&s;tantly &s;at down, and wrote the epi&s;tle I mentioned having been in a manner compelled to take Har|riot&mdash;and which I will now tran|&s;cribe for your peru&s;al, as I pro|mi&s;ed, having thus told you the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Douglas and me on the oc|ca&s;ion, as well as his dialogue with my lord.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mi&s;s BROWN TO Lord TEMPLETON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>London.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE information I am going to give your lord&s;hip; will, I tru&s;t, be deemed a &s;ufficient apology for this trouble&mdash;it pains me exceedingly to confe&s;s, I am,
<PB N="81" REF="82">
and have been a daily witne&s;s to the mo&s;t wicked and &s;hameful plot carried on again&s;t your lord|&s;hip, that ever was invented, tho' not an accomplice, as this letter, I hope, will &s;erve to convince you.</P>
<P>I live with Mrs. Bellmour, my lord, your attachment to Mi&s;s Beverley (as &s;he is called) is no &s;ecret to any one in the family, 'tis a circum&s;tance too flattering to be concealed&mdash;it a&s;toni&s;hes me, indeed, that the mi&s;terious conduct, they have thought proper to ob&s;erve, does not alarm your lord&s;hip; they, however, find it an&s;wers their
<PB N="82" REF="83">
villanous purpo&s;e&punc; but forgive the&s;e reflections, they are foreign to what I have to relate.</P>
<P>Know then, my lord, that this Mi&s;s Beverly is no other than a natural daughter of Mrs Bell|mours; well might &s;he &s;ay &s;he had the charge of her education; alas! &s;he has educated her for the mo&s;t infamous purpo&s;es; beautiful and accompli&s;hed, &s;he is, as every one mu&s;t allow&mdash;Mr. Douglas, her <HI>pre|tended friend</HI> is upon the mo&s;t in|timate footing with her&mdash;I blu&s;h to write it; but her ba&s;e, her mo&s;t worthle&s;s mother &s;acrificed her to
<PB N="83" REF="84">
him, when &s;carce fifteen&mdash;with him, &s;he has lived ever &s;ince&mdash;I believe, indeed, he has nothing to reproach her with, in regard to her conduct from that time; but he has now views of another nature, and of cour&s;e finds Mi&s;s Bellmour, (for that is her real name) an ob&s;tacle to them.</P>
<P>At the time your lord&s;hip was &s;o much &s;truck with her appear|ance on &s;eeing her here, her wretched mother was actually in treaty with a man of fortune, who offered to grant her a &s;ettlement for life, as his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;the affair
<PB N="84" REF="85">
was on the point of being con|cluded, and certainly would be|fore this time, had not your lord|&s;hip given hopes that you might ab&s;olutely, if things were properly managed, be induced to make her your wife&mdash;the great difficulty now was, what account to give of her family and connections, which they naturally imagined, would of cour&s;e be enquired into by your lord&s;hip&mdash;this was a perplexity not ea&s;ily got over&mdash;they, therefore, determined to adopt the plan they have &s;ince &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully followed.&mdash;that is, to acknowledge, there was a mi&s;tery in her &s;ituation,
<PB N="85" REF="86">
which &s;he was not yet at liberty to explain.</P>
<P>They mentioned an ab&s;ent re|lation, at who&s;e return all would be cleared up&mdash;but the truth is, my Lord, they hoped to exhau&s;t your patience, for well do they know no &s;uch being exi&s;ts, though I make no doubt, they could ea&s;ily produce a per&s;on to a&s;&s;ume that character, could it an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e; they hoped, I &s;ay your lord&s;hip's pa&s;&s;ion, would at la&s;t &s;o far blind you, as to induce you to make honorable propo&s;als, rather than continue to be thus denied permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">
Can any thing in life, my lord, be more artful?&mdash;I confe&s;s it was my&s;elf; who &s;uffered Lady Beningfield to go up to her apart|ment, knowing Mr. Douglas was then <HI>with her,</HI> and ea&s;ily hoping her lady&s;hip might have proof &s;uf|ficient to have left her no doubt of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions &s;he at pre&s;ent entertains of the duplicity of her character; though &s;he mi&s;takes the object, Mi&s;s Beverly had how|ever, I found contrived to conceal him in a clo&s;et time enough to prevent &s;o important a di&s;|covery.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88">
When I wi&s;hed her lady&s;hip to be fully convinced. I confe&s;s it was not from any degree of partiality I felt for her; but concluded your lord|&s;hip would of cour&s;e be informed of it; which knowing your worth and amiable character I mo&s;t &s;in|cerely de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Indeed, had my wi&s;hes been grati|fied, and &s;he had given your lord&s;hip an account of the di&s;covery; 'tis po&s;&s;ible it might, coming from <HI>her,</HI> have appeared the effects of jealou&s;y, and not have gained credit: I am no &s;tranger my lord to Lady Beningfield's motives, for her cu|rio&s;ity,
<PB N="88" REF="89">
pardon me for taking the liberty to mention this circum|&s;tance, it leads to another&mdash;which is this!</P>
<P>Finding all her own hopes of gain|ing your lord&s;hip's hand at an end, &s;he now from the mo&s;t implacable ha|tred and revenge would give worlds, that you may be drawn in, to marry this beautiful; but unfortunate girl&mdash;I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed, were her lady&s;hip artful enough to attempt, even to per&s;uade you to it; for &s;he has had power &s;ufficient by the help of gold, to learn the truth of Mi&s;s Beverly's &s;tory from
<PB N="89" REF="90">
Bellmour, the latter from the tenor of her con&s;ervation, found letting her into the &s;ecret, would rather pro|mote than fru&s;trate her &s;candalous de&s;ign, and when fully informed, &s;he declared, as I mentioned above, nothing on earth would give her &s;o much plea&s;ure as to &s;ee your lord|&s;hip &s;o <HI>gloriou&s;ly taken in,</HI> that was her very expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Beware then my lord of the whole &s;et, 'tis true, were Lady Beningfield to appear an advocate now, for a match, &s;he &s;o lately dreaded as the greate&s;t of all evils, you might naturally &s;u&s;pect her &s;incerity; yet,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
who can &s;ay, how much an in|genuous, a generous mind like your lord&s;hips (particularly when urged to what at pre&s;ent is &s;o con&s;onant to your inclinations) might be in|duced to credit?</P>
<P>That <HI>I</HI> my lord can have no in|tere&s;ted motives for what I write, I need hardly mention&mdash;on the contrary, were it known by any of the family, I had thus be|trayed them, I know not, if even my life would be in &s;afety&mdash;but I have &s;o much confidence in your lord&s;hip's honor, and am &s;o &s;hocked at the horrible contrivance that I venture it, without he&s;itation.</P>

<P>WHAT can tempt you thus to prolong your &s;tay, my dear Rochley? after my repeatedly informing you, you have nothing
<PB N="93" REF="94">
farther to apprehend on Sir John We&s;tbury's account, the fellow is quite recovered, and ready for another tilting about whenever you will be kind enough to put your|&s;elf <HI>unarmed</HI> in his way again, have you no compa&s;&s;ion for the di|vine Caroline? fie upon you Or|lando! I believed you a man of more gallantry than to ab&s;ent your|&s;elf one moment longer than was nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>your</HI> &s;afety and her happine&s;s of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Do prithee wheel about to the right, and march home as fa&s;t as you can&mdash;I have &s;uch a &s;tory to treat you with&mdash;but I bar all
<PB N="94" REF="95">
jokes upon the &s;ubject mind that or I am dumb.</P>
<P>I have had &s;uch an e&s;cape&mdash;no, if I live to the age of, what's his name in the bible&mdash;I &s;hall not have half time enough to be &s;ufficiently thankful.</P>
<P>Would you believe it? I had ab|&s;olutely brought my&s;elf to think &s;eriou&s;ly of making an offer of marriage to the Dulcinea I have &s;o heriocally raved about to you for &s;ome time pa&s;t, true upon my honor, finding no po&s;&s;ibility to &s;torm her ca&s;tle&mdash;or rather I &s;hould
<PB N="95" REF="96">
&s;ay to gain admi&s;&s;ion without &s;torming it; I had fully determined, to take her <HI>for better for wor&s;e</HI>&mdash;her old friend&mdash;ah cur&s;e him!&mdash;had &s;o wrought on my pa&s;&s;ions by his flaming account of her <HI>mental</HI> perfections (tho&s;e of her per&s;on I had &s;een and admired to my co&s;t) that I actually authori&s;ed him to a&s;&s;ure her, I wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o ardently, as to make her honorably mine, and implored him to prevail on her, to accept my offered hand.</P>
<P>Yes, Rochley, thus far had my infatuation for the bewitching the enchanting girl, &s;educed me from
<PB N="96" REF="97">
the paths of common &s;en&s;e, when behold my guardian angel in&s;pired one of the infernal pack with &s;en|timents of pity for the &s;crape I was in, &s;he, for which I am certainly bound to pray for her every day of my life, &s;ent me a full and parti|cular account of the <HI>birth, pa|rentage, life, character,</HI> and <HI>beha|viour,</HI> of my fair (till then un|known) en&s;laver.&mdash;Ah! "what a falling off was there?" it was a la&s;t dying &s;peech to all my hopes of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>All my comfort is, I was wi&s;e enough to conceal her name and
<PB N="97" REF="98">
place of abode even from you. I will not take upon me more merit than I am entitled to however, on that account, &s;ince the truth is, I was &s;o wholly engro&s;&s;ed by de|&s;cribing the angel, that tho&s;e un|important matters never occured to me, but <HI>now</HI> my not having done it, does with no &s;mall &s;atis|faction, &s;ince had you known one, or either of tho&s;e particulars, you might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;till more rea|&s;on to laugh at me, by finding I had been &s;ighing for a dear crea|ture, who had not let <HI>you &s;igh in vain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">
In &s;hort, Rochley, I under&s;tand &s;he is neither more nor le&s;s at this precious moment, than mi&s;tre&s;s of that old fellow, who has taken &s;uch pains to en&s;nare me.</P>
<P>This I fortunately learned ye&s;|terday from one who re&s;ides in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and who knows the whole ri&s;e and progre&s;s of their infamous intrigue.</P>
<P>That I am horridly mortified I need not tell you, yet would you believe it? I am &s;till fool enough to love the dear charming girl, in &s;pite of my better judgment. 'Tis
<PB N="99" REF="100">
ab&s;olutely incomprehen&s;ible to me, how a pa&s;&s;ion, violent as this that con&s;umes me, could be excited by &s;uch tran&s;ient views, as merely &s;eeing her twice at her window, and once, when by accident I went there with that <HI>friend,</HI> Lady Be|ningfield, and your Caroline, the latter was no le&s;s &s;truck with the elegance of her figure than my&s;elf, the former affected to have entirely overlooked her, though &s;he has &s;ince given too convincing proofs of the fal&s;ity of that a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;but to this there hangs a tale, which as things are turned out, I cannot take the trouble of recounting.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101">
I was driven in my fir&s;t tran|&s;ports of rage, almo&s;t to di&s;traction, and was tempted to commit &s;ome de&s;perate act of violence&mdash;but that I fortunately recollected the whole crew of them as unworthy my re|venge, or rather fear; a lurking partiality for the object of my pa&s;&s;ion checked my re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I determined therefore to leave them to enjoy the di&s;appointment, to &s;et off in&s;tantly for the country, and there endeavour to forget the tran&s;cendant charms of my perfi|dious fair one, who, I am &s;till credulous enough to believe is more to be pitied than blamed.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">
For this weakne&s;s you, Rochley, will probably condemn me&mdash;but had you &s;een her, yes, had you &s;een the fa&s;cinating charmer, you too mu&s;t have adored her as I did!&mdash;did, do I &s;ay? the &s;ame infatu|ation &s;till per&s;ues me, and pleads but too &s;trongly in her favor, in &s;pite of the dreadful intelligence, I have received.</P>
<P>That appearances are again&s;t her, I mu&s;t allow&mdash;&s;trongly again&s;t her&mdash;yet &s;he may,&mdash;but what a folly is this?&mdash;Is there a &s;imple doubt remaining?&mdash;no, Orlando, no!&mdash;Let me fly then&mdash;I dare not

<P>I AM all a&s;toni&s;hment my dear! Never was there &s;o extraordi|nary an affair!&mdash;every thing that has pa&s;t &s;ince my Orlando left me ap|pears a dream, I really dare hardly tru&s;t my &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
I have told you Harriot, repeat|edly told you, <HI>if I mi&s;take not,</HI> the unremitted endeavours Lord Tem|pleton made to prevail upon me to admit his vi&s;its. I have told you I think how very earne&s;t he was to per&s;uade me he had conceived the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion for me, and honorable as violent&mdash;all this you have heard, but what I am now going to tell you, will I fancy &s;ur|pri&s;e you infinitely more.</P>
<P>Mr. Douglas delivered the few lines I &s;ent him&mdash;his lord&s;hip cho&s;e to find more <HI>beauties</HI> than there were <HI>letters</HI> in the whole
<PB N="105" REF="106">
performance, he was in raptures,&mdash;tran&s;ported with my amiable conde&s;cen&s;ion, adored me more if po&s;&s;ible than ever for my candor&mdash;in &s;hort, &s;et a far greater value on the favour than it was worth, and &s;wore he could not exi&s;t unle&s;s I would permit him to thank me in per&s;on, and at the &s;ame time to offer me his hand and heart, beg|ging Mr. Douglas would do all in his power to procure him this ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>All this the worthy man repeated to me almo&s;t as much tran&s;ported with joy as his lord&s;hip, and no
<PB N="106" REF="107">
le&s;s earne&s;t with me to grant his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Fully per&s;uaded they were both &s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ions, I actu|ally found my&s;elf beginning to waver in my re&s;olution of wait|ing for my dear brothers return&mdash;&s;o perpetually importuned, what could I do?&mdash;at la&s;t, I told Mr. Douglas, I would take a day or two to con&s;ider the propriety of what he a&s;ked this was giving hopes, and with the&s;e hopes, he flew to my lord, who was again in raptures.</P>
<P>During my deliberation, my good old friend had been &s;o much
<PB N="107" REF="108">
engaged in the city, that I had &s;carce &s;een him, by the way I am &s;orry to tell you he talks of leaving London &s;oon, and kindly declares nothing but the intere&s;t he takes in my affairs could have detained him here &s;o long.</P>
<P>For two or three days, I &s;ay, I &s;carcely &s;aw him&mdash;when ye&s;terday in his way from the city, he called on his lord&s;hip, in order, as he drolely &s;aid, to enquire how his patience held out; but gue&s;s, if you can, Harriot, of his con&s;ter|nation, when informed by the porter, his lord&s;hip had left Lon|don
<PB N="108" REF="109">
the day before, ordering him to acquaint any per&s;on who might call for him, that he &s;hould not return for &s;everal months, perhaps not then, as he had &s;ome thoughts of going abroad.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Douglas was quite thunder&s;truck, and for &s;ome time could not believe he under&s;tood what the man &s;aid&mdash;however, after his repeating it many times he was compelled, though much again&s;t his inclination to credit the intelligence.</P>
<P>Never &s;hall I forget the various pa&s;&s;ions di&s;played on his expre&s;&s;ive,
<PB N="109" REF="110">
his benevolent countenance when giving me this information&mdash;rage&mdash;contempt, and cruel di&s;appoint|ment were &s;trongly pictured in every feature.</P>
<P>How I looked at that embar|ra&s;&s;ing moment, Heaven only knows! for Mr. Douglas was too violently agitated him&s;elf to make any remarks; but my feelings were hurt beyond all conception&mdash;I felt a glow of pride and indig|nation on my cheek&mdash;aud could not articulate a &s;yllable, might I have had the univer&s;e, yet wi&s;hed to &s;ay &s;omething in order to per&s;uade
<PB N="110" REF="111">
him; I was not &s;o much di&s;con|certed, as his hone&s;t worthy heart apprehended.</P>
<P>At length, after various e&s;&s;ays for utterance? why, my dear Sir, are you thus unea&s;y? believe me, I am not; con&s;ider, I had in fact, very little knowledge of his lord|&s;hip, con&s;equently could be no way attached to him; have I not great rea&s;on to be thankful, this is the ca&s;e? I might, perhaps, had I been better acquainted with him, have conceived a partiality, then indeed this unaccountable conduct might have given me &s;ome pain, but as it is&mdash;what have I to regret?</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112">
Talk not &s;o calmly, replied he with energy; do not for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince I knew you attempt to play the hypocrite! &s;peak of him, as he de&s;erves! execrate his very name, as I do from my &s;oul! he is a vilain!&mdash;yes, I &s;ay a vilain!&mdash;none, but a being, who ju&s;tly merits that har&s;h appellation, could have behaved in &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o da&s;tardly a manner; but by Heavens! if ever I meet him, old as I am, I will call him to a &s;trict account, he has not only gro&s;sly in&s;ulted the mo&s;t de&s;erving of her &s;ex, but me al&s;o;&mdash;and dearly &s;hall he pay for it, if ever I am &s;o fortunate, as to &s;et eyes on him again.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113">
Yes, my good, my dear child; he &s;hall know that, I am not a man to be affronted with impu|nity.</P>
<P>Though I ju&s;t now blamed your prudent, your calm behaviour, be a&s;&s;ured, I honor you for it, 'tis &s;pirited, 'tis noble, and like every other part of your conduct, thank Heaven! you are not attached to &s;o worthle&s;s a wretch&mdash;no Mi&s;s Beverly, I tru&s;t a better fate awaits you&mdash;I did mean, as I told you to leave town in a few days, but no bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall now oblige me to quit you.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114">
I will &s;tay, at lea&s;t, till your brother returns, and will before I part from you, &s;ee you once more, &s;afely under his protection, and tru&s;t he will never again leave &s;o precious a charge to the mercy of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I mean not to reflect on your friend Mrs. Bellmour. I believe &s;he is a worthy well meaning woman; &s;he could neither fore&s;ee, nor have prevented what has hap|pened&mdash;but let us forget it.</P>

<P>This injunction, had he given it, you may believe I could not ea&s;ily have obeyed.</P>

<P>Does not this, Harriot, appear the mo&s;t probable conjecture one can form?&mdash;yet, but a few days before, how very different did his &s;entiments &s;eem to be, what agonies did he expre&s;s for the in&s;ult I had met with from that vile Lady Ben|ingfield&mdash;in &s;hort, I can only re|peat 'tis all a mi&s;tery, all wholly incomprehen&s;ible.</P>

Another circum&s;tance gives me on reflection much plea&s;ure, I mean my never having given a hint to my Orlando of my <HI>imagi|nary</HI> conque&s;t&mdash;I thought it would have an appearance of vanity to tell him of it; and that it would be time enough, &s;hould any thing really come of it: how lucky was this, my dear Harriot, on two accounts.</P>

<P>IF my la&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed you, my deare&s;t Harriot, I think I may venture to pronounce this will do it &s;till more. I am certainly born to meet with very extraordinary adventures, if one may call them &s;uch; and really, though that has rather too much of the romantic in it, I know not what other ap|pellation to give them.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">

I have &s;uch news, my dear, to tell you, as will put you out of your <HI>little wits</HI> with joy, this you know is ever your lively expre&s;&s;ion on any par|ticularly happy event.</P>
<P>I wrote, as I told you I intended, to my Orlando, begging he would
<PB N="124" REF="125">
ha&s;ten his return&mdash;&s;ome time after Mr. Douglas and I were &s;itting to|gether talking over the affair of Lord Templeton, and forming a thou|&s;and fruitle&s;s conjectures concern|ing his unaccountable behaviour, when a po&s;t-chai&s;e drove to the door.&mdash;I flew to the window, my heart telling me it was my Orlando. It was, Harriot! it was him&s;elf!&mdash;in a moment I found my&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed to his affectionate bo&s;om, and &s;uch was my tran&s;port, I had very near fainted; however, I luckily did not.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t agitation a little &s;ub&s;i|ded, I recollected my good Mr.
<PB N="125" REF="126">
Douglas, who &s;tood gazing on us with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure; taking my darling brother's hand, I led him to him.&mdash;Orlando, &s;aid I, let me introduce you to this gentle|man; much are you indebted to him, I do a&s;&s;ure you, for the con|&s;tant attention and friend&s;hip he has &s;hewn your poor I&s;abella; he has, during your ab&s;ence, been my guardian, my generous pro|tector.</P>
<P>They embraced each other with great cordiality, my brother ex|pre&s;&s;ing his acknowledgments of my good friend's kindne&s;s in the
<PB N="126" REF="127">
mo&s;t grateful and plea&s;ing manner.&mdash;The worthy man would now have left us, but we begged he would do us the favour to &s;tay and partake of our &s;atisfaction. He then took his &s;eat, and was diverted with the thou&s;and que&s;tions I a&s;ked my dear brother, &s;o rapidly as to put it out of his power to an&s;wer any one of them.</P>
<P>In this delightful &s;ituation were we chatting, when one of Mrs. Bellmour's &s;ervants opening the door of my apartment, and ju&s;t peeping in &s;aid, pray Madam, is Colonel Rochley here? the po&s;|tillions
<PB N="127" REF="128">
are de&s;irous of being di&s;|charged&mdash;I ob&s;erved Mr. Douglas looked amazed; I prote&s;t I had quite forgot the poor fellows, cried Orlando, in my hurry to &s;ee you my dear I&s;abella; &s;o &s;aying, he went down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Did I hear right? &s;aid Mr. Dou|glas; did not the &s;ervant mi&s;take your brother's name? did &s;he not call him Rochley?&mdash;She did, Sir. How then (cried he, with a kind of impatience, a &s;ort of I know not what in his manner) comes yours to be Beverley? pray explain this my&s;tery; I have very particular
<PB N="128" REF="129">
rea&s;ons for being thus inqui&s;itive. Rochley!&mdash;good God!&mdash;can it be? is it in nature?&mdash;&s;peak, my dear child! and put an end to this &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>I was diverted with his emotions, looking upon them as nothing more than his &s;urpri&s;e at finding me &s;o much attached to a half brother, which I concluded he now fancied he was, by our names being diffe|rent; and was preparing to ac|quaint him with the truth, and why I had taken that of Beverly when Orlando returned to us.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="130">
Come, my dear brother, &s;aid I &s;miling, come and help to ex|pound an enigma that &s;eems to puzzle my good friend not a little. I now gave him the rea&s;ons which had induced me to adopt what in the end proved &s;o very perplexing. Your name, then, is ab&s;olutely Rochley? cried he, with &s;till more energy and expre&s;&s;ion in his voice and countenance, than we thought the ca&s;e required.&mdash;Both your names are Rochley?&mdash;pardon me, I mu&s;t a&s;k a few more que&s;tions.&mdash;In what part of England did your father live?&mdash;what was your mo|thers maiden name?</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">
Harriot, this que&s;tion gave ri&s;e in&s;tantly to a thou&s;and confu&s;ed ideas&mdash;never till that moment had it once occurred to me that as her name was Douglas (as you well know) there was a po&s;&s;ibility that he might be related to her, I now wondered it never had&mdash;but there are &s;o many in all parts of the world of the &s;ame name, yet not related, that I never thought about it.</P>
<P>In fine, I had no &s;ooner told him it was Douglas, and that our father's &s;eat was in Warwick&s;hire, with &s;ome other particulars, than
<PB N="131" REF="132">
ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, and gazing on us both with every mark of kind|ne&s;s, affection, and &s;urpri&s;e, he exclaimed, it mu&s;t be&mdash;it mu&s;t be &s;o! I can no longer doubt it; come to my arms, my dear chil|dren, let me pre&s;s to my delighted heart the &s;on and daughter of my lamented, my beloved &s;i&s;ter&mdash;yes, behold in me her only brother.</P>
<P>Can you, my dear Harriot, figure to your&s;elf our a&s;toni&s;hment or our joy?&mdash;'tis impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;for &s;ome moments, it produced a &s;cene of the mo&s;t agreeable confu&s;ion; he continued to a&s;k a thou&s;and que&s;|tions,
<PB N="132" REF="133">
to which our an&s;wers were &s;o fully &s;atisfactory, that not a doubt remained of the very im|portant truth. No wonder, cried the delighted Mr. Douglas, I was &s;o tenderly attached to this dear child; &s;he made a mo&s;t extraor|dinary impre&s;&s;ion on me the fir&s;t moment I beheld her&mdash;but 'tis now ea&s;ily accounted for&mdash;though then it amazed me, all lovely and de|&s;erving as &s;he is, to find how much I felt my&s;elf intere&s;ted in her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>May I not flatter my&s;elf, &s;aid Orlando, re&s;pectfully, taking his
<PB N="133" REF="134">
hand, the brother of your engaging favourite will al&s;o be honored with a place in your e&s;teem? be a&s;&s;ured, my dear Sir, it &s;hall from this happy moment be the &s;tudy of his life to merit that di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Doubt it not, cried our kind un|cle, the &s;triking re&s;emblance I find in you to your amiable mother, would alone in&s;ure it to you; but you have &s;till better claims; this dear child has &s;aid &s;o much in your prai&s;e, has &s;et your character in &s;o fair a light, that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it long before I &s;aw you; and I need not add, your manner, per|&s;on,
<PB N="134" REF="135">
and addre&s;s, have confirmed the idea I had formed of you.</P>
<P>He again embraced us both with tender affection, bidding us look upon him as a father, who&s;e great|e&s;t plea&s;ure it would be to do every thing in his power to render us happy; and if wealth, con|tinued he, can do it, that power, thank providence, is mine.</P>
<P>The news of this di&s;covery was &s;oon &s;pread through the family, and my kind friend, Mrs. Bell|mour, &s;ent up her re&s;pectful com|pliments, begging we would per|mit
<PB N="135" REF="136">
her to wait upon us, that &s;he might offer her &s;incere congratu|lations upon the fortunate event.</P>
<P>This, Harriot, you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, was readily granted&mdash;&s;he came up, and ab&s;olutely &s;hed tears of joy&mdash;When we were tolerably compo&s;ed, and the fir&s;t delightful emotions began to &s;ub&s;ide, Mr. Douglas gave us his hi&s;tory in few words, as follows:</P>
<P>At eighteen he went to the Ea&s;t-Indies, in a very lucrative employ|ment, there he &s;oon made a con|&s;iderable fortune; he married an
<PB N="136" REF="137">
amiable woman, who brought him a large addition to it; by her he had two &s;ons, who when they were of a proper age, he brought over to England, for their education.</P>
<P>At that time our dear mother was ju&s;t going to be married; &s;he was many years younger than her brother&mdash;he was pre&s;ent at her nuptials, and having placed his boys under the care of proper ma&s;ters, he returned to India.</P>
<P>He had not been there more than twelvemonths, when he re|ceived the melancholy intelligence
<PB N="137" REF="138">
of his elde&s;t &s;on's death, this was a &s;evere &s;troke, you may imagine, my dear Harriot, to &s;o affectionate, &s;o tender a parent&mdash;but his affliction was &s;oon after greatly encrea&s;ed by the lo&s;s of a wife he adored&mdash;I need make no comments on the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, your own feelings will render that unne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>All his care, all his affection now centered in his &s;urviving &s;on;&mdash;for &s;everal years the accounts he heard of his improvements, con|&s;oled him as far as con&s;olation was po&s;&s;ible for his former lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">
He had thoughts of coming to England, in order to judge how far the encomiums he heard of his &s;on were ju&s;t, when he received a letter from this darling &s;on, in|treating his permi&s;&s;ion to join him in India, as his education was now fully completed, and his inclination led him to return to the land of his nativity. To this his father readily con&s;ented. He &s;oon after obtaining the de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion, but alas, Harriot&mdash;never reached the de&s;tined port, the &s;hip was lo&s;t, and every &s;oul on board pe|ri&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">

deprived of all he held dear, determined &s;hould be heirs to his fortune.&mdash;He therefore &s;ettled his affairs, and returned to England, and was but ju&s;t arrived, when chance brought him to Mrs. Bell|mour.</P>
<P>Having tran&s;acted the bu&s;ine&s;s he had to do in London, his de&s;ign was to go into Warwick&s;hire, to enquire for our family&mdash;he heard however, in London, of our father's death, and the fatal con&s;equences of his mi&s;conduct. He had in|telligence al&s;o, that his nephew was abroad, and was highly plea&s;ed
<PB N="141" REF="142">
with the character given of him, of me he had no hopes of gaining any information, till he went to the country.</P>
<P>Thus, Harriot, have I in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, made you ac|quainted with the important, but happy change in our &s;ituation.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am &s;till in &s;o agreeable a flutter, that you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I now bid you adieu.</P>

<P>And why not to the company, my lord?</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. Douglas, indulge me &s;o far as to look it over fir&s;t, and if you &s;hall then think proper to make the contents known, I &s;hall readily acquie&s;ce, as I am no &s;tran|ger to the delicacy of your &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>I would now have retired; in|deed I wi&s;hed to have done &s;o be|fore,

My lord frequently &s;tole a glance at me; a thou&s;and hopes and fears &s;eemed alternately to agitate his bo&s;om.</P>

the very thing I hoped it would prevent.</P>
<P>Lord Templeton &s;aw you&mdash;your charms made a deep (and I believe it will be a la&s;ting) impre&s;&s;ion on his heart&mdash;how he contrived to in|form you of his pa&s;&s;ion, you al|ready know, and I al&s;o now know with what propriety, what true de|licacy my I&s;abella conducted her|&s;elf on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of his quitting London in the &s;trange abrupt manner he did, which &s;o ju&s;tly gave ri&s;e
<PB N="200" REF="201">
to your a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;|plea&s;ure, (appearances were un|doubtedly &s;trongly again&s;t him) the cau&s;e I &s;ay was the letter he gave my uncle to read&mdash;in that letter, my poor &s;i&s;ter is mo&s;t <HI>capitally &s;landered,</HI> and our worthy generous uncle no le&s;s &s;o&mdash;I will not &s;hock your ears my dear with all the infamous, the horrid particulars, &s;uffice it to &s;ay, they are &s;uch as fully excu&s;es Lord Templeton, the circum&s;tances are but too plau&s;ibly put together&mdash;but you will never gue&s;s who is the diabolical author of it, who
<PB N="201" REF="202">
neverthele&s;s has not &s;crupled in order to give the calumny more weight to &s;ign her name to it.</P>
<P>Ah! tell me that, at lea&s;t my deare&s;t Orlando, let me conjure you; but to inform me who can have been &s;o cruelly, &s;o cau&s;le&s;sly my enemy? for &s;ure I am, I am uncon&s;cious of ever having to my knowledge given offence to any living creature.</P>
<P>No other my dear, than one of the young women at Mrs. Bell|mour's, her name Jane Brown.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
Good Heavens! (exclaimed I in the greate&s;t amazement) what on earth could be <HI>her</HI> motive for &s;o horrid a piece of wickedne&s;s? I am confounded! ab&s;olutely a|&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>After reflecting a few minutes, Orlando, continued I, &s;he mu&s;t have been bribed to this, <HI>&s;he</HI> could have no intere&s;t in the affair&mdash;'tis impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t have been tempted to lend her name to &s;ome per&s;on of more importance, and that per&s;on I am po&s;itive can be no other than Lady Beningfield.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
In order to convince my brother, my conjecture was at lea&s;t founded on <HI>probability,</HI> Harriot: I now told him of the treatment I had met with from her&mdash;I found he was no &s;tranger to her pa&s;&s;ion for his lord|&s;hip, and of cour&s;e putting tho&s;e two circum&s;tances together as I had done, was fully per&s;uaded I had cleared up <HI>that</HI> mi&s;tery, which to <HI>them</HI> had been inexplicable.</P>
<P>However, &s;aid my brother, we &s;hall &s;oon put the matter beyond all doubt, for my friend left us in order to <HI>wait upon the amiable</HI> Mi&s;s
<PB N="204" REF="205">
Jane Brown, and if &s;he has not had the wi&s;dom and decency to <HI>de|camp,</HI> he will &s;pare no pains to make her &s;peak truth for once in her life.</P>
<P>Now, my dear I&s;abella, (if you knew all you would) confe&s;s that appearances were rather again&s;t you, as well as your penitent adorer.</P>
<P>But ought, the &s;aid penitent adorer, my dear brother, to have &s;o readily given credit to the vile in&s;inuations whatever they
<PB N="205" REF="206">
were?&mdash;I feel my pride a good deal piqued I a&s;&s;ure you, Orlando, at his daring to &s;u&s;pect&mdash;</P>
<P>I&s;abella, your ob&s;ervation in al|mo&s;t any other in&s;tance of a &s;imilar nature would have been per|fectly ju&s;t, (an&s;wered my brother) but if ever a man might be excu&s;ed for his credulity, I mu&s;t &s;ay, this ca&s;e is one of them, never was there &s;o infamous a fal&s;hood made to appear &s;o like truth, never was there a &s;tory of &s;o much plau&s;i|bility invented, or one &s;o likely to gain belief.&mdash;A girl like that could
<PB N="206" REF="207">
not <HI>I</HI> verily think have compo&s;ed it&mdash;yet Lady Beningfield appears to me even le&s;s capable&mdash;I mean in regard to the &s;tile, and manner of expre&s;&s;ion, in &s;hort 'tis a ma&s;ter piece in its kind&mdash;but we &s;hall &s;ee.</P>
<P>In the mean time, tell me my love, what am I to &s;ay to poor Templeton? for he is as unhappy as any mortal can po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t tell me what &s;aid our uncle? is <HI>he</HI> &s;atisfied? does he think my lord &s;tands acquitted?</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
Why, to tell you the truth, my dear I&s;abella, <HI>he</HI> too thinks he ought not to have given &s;uch implicit credit to the d&mdash;nd &s;crawl, (as he very ju&s;tly calls it) as not to have made &s;ome farther enquiries, and continues rather &s;tately, yet he owns &s;omething may <HI>be &s;aid</HI> in the poor culprits favor, but is at pre&s;ent too much irritated to &s;ay it him|&s;elf, or hearken to it from another,&mdash;time, however, will I tru&s;t, re&s;tore him to his favor and friend|&s;hip; but 'tis in regard to <HI>your's</HI> my dear, my friend is infinitely more anxious.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="209">
Oh, as to mine, that's a trifle, men get over the&s;e violent attach|ments with wonderful ea&s;e, be under no apprehen&s;ions brother, his lord&s;hip will do mighty well, however I may think proper to de|cide the matter.</P>
<P>I&s;abella, that is not &s;poke with your u&s;ual candour&mdash;and in re|venge, I will now tell you, that I know to a certainty&mdash;yes, to a <HI>certainty, that</HI> little heart of thine would be a good deal mortified, if you now &s;poke your real &s;enti|ments, my friend Templeton is
<PB N="209" REF="210">
not the kind of man to be looked upon with &s;o much cool indiffer|ence as my &s;ly &s;i&s;ter would per|&s;uade me &s;he beholds him with, &s;o you may as well drop a character that is not natural to you my dear, and be again your&s;elf, for believe your Orlando, you cannot po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume any other half &s;o amiable.</P>
<P>I ki&s;&s;ed his dear cheek, Harriot, for this very kind and plea&s;ing &s;peech, and hone&s;tly told him, I believed he had di&s;covered a window in my brea&s;t, as he had &s;o ea&s;ily
<PB N="210" REF="211">
contrived to get a peep into that heart, who&s;e feelings I had &s;o fooli&s;hly wi&s;hed to conceal.</P>
<P>That's a good girl, now you are again my own I&s;abella.</P>
<P>No need to let his lord&s;hip into this pretty &s;ecret, though my dear brother (as he was taking his leave of me) remember that if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>O, never fear, I &s;hall leave him to make the flattering di&s;covery as <HI>I have done.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="212">
So &s;aying, he with a &s;ignificant &s;mile on his fine face left me, no doubt to go in &s;earch of his <HI>penitent</HI> friend.</P>
<P>Really Harriot, 'tis full time I &s;hould now take my leave of you, for this is a mo&s;t enormous packet, but I wi&s;hed to give you the whole &s;tory without any interruption in my narrative, how it will end, is more than I can at pre&s;ent take upon me to inform you of, though things &s;eem to be taking rather an agreeable turn.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="213">
I have had &s;o much to &s;ay about my&s;elf, that I have had no time lately to write a &s;ingle word about my Orlando's <HI>fair one.</HI> I will ju&s;t mention, however, that he has had a mo&s;t delightful <HI>billet doux</HI> from the dear girl, and that &s;he continues all he can po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Sir John is in <HI>&s;tatu quo</HI>&mdash;which being <HI>rendered into plain Engli&s;h, is a bear &s;till,</HI> &s;wearing &s;he &s;hall never, if he can prevent it, give her hand to the man who would have taken his life.</P>

If he can prevent it, Harriot&mdash;that's a &s;aving clau&s;e&mdash;for it runs &s;trangely in my head he <HI>cannot ergo,</HI> &s;he will give it him, and that too e'er, many months en&s;ue.</P>
