<L>All the globe we now behold,</L>

<L>Smoke and fire at once enfold!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the works of art &s;o curious,</L>
<L>Lofty cities, temples, towers!</L>
<L>See the raging flame &s;o furious,</L>
<L>All the mighty ma&s;s devours!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You who doat on earthly trea&s;ures,</L>
<L>What di&s;may will &s;eize your frame,</L>

<L>Lo! the multitudes &s;urrounding,</L>
<L>Whom the grave no more can keep?</L>
<L>Hark! the awful trumpet &s;ounding!</L>
<L>Death has broke his leaden &s;leep.</L>

<L>See the LORD of life de&s;cending,</L>
<L>Hear the dread ARCHANGEL'S voice;</L>
<L>See the dead on CHRIST attending;</L>
<L>How the &s;aints of GOD rejoice!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Myriads at that voice &s;hall gather,</L>
