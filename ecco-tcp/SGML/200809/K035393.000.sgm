<P>THE formality with which this lit|tle performance is divided into &s;ections, and illu&s;trated with notes, may po&s;&s;i|bly give umbrage to the more &s;prightly and volatile criticks of the pre&s;ent times.

<HEAD>A DEFENCE OF Mr. KENRICK's REVIEW OF Dr. JOHNSON's SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. INTRODUCTORY.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a well-bred age do we live in? Time was, when writers might boldly call in que&s;tion the abilities of each other, without incurring the cen|&s;ure of <HI>malignity,</HI> or even &s;ometimes forfeiting their title to di&s;tingui&s;hed urbanity; when the meane&s;t in|dividual in the Republick of Letters had a right to bring the charge of <HI>ignorance</HI> or <HI>inattention</HI> again&s;t the proude&s;t champion that ever brandi&s;hed goo&s;e-quill; when he might cite the accu&s;ed to appear at the bar of the publick, and give te&s;timony in plain terms again&s;t him without ceremony or equivocation. Time was, I &s;ay, when this impartial tribunal al&s;o, attentive only to the matter of fact and the evidence laid before it,
<PB N="2" REF="7">
pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on the <HI>convicted</HI> without re&s;pect of per|&s;ons, honouring the pro&s;ecutor with its thanks and protection, as a friend to ju&s;tice and the intere&s;ts of literature.</P>
<P>How different is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent! when the &s;anc|tion of a literary reputation, however obtained, is &s;imi|lar to a certain political privilege, however acquired; though it be notorious that ignorance and partiality operate as powerfully in the one ca&s;e, as bribery and corruption are &s;ometimes &s;uppo&s;ed to do in the other. But when the candidates are once chaired, and their opponents have not influence enough to get them ex|pelled, it is theirs to &s;it in judgment on their fellow &s;ubjects, and give laws to the world of letters.</P>
<P>It is well, however, for the progre&s;s of <HI>Science,</HI> and the independency of <HI>Wit,</HI> that the Se&s;&s;ion of the Lite|rary Junto is not &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed as that of the political. They are both provided, indeed, with their u&s;hers and &s;erjeants re&s;pectively; but, however tre|mendous may be the magi&s;terial authority of the one, nothing can be more ridiculous than the critical mock-maje&s;ty of the other.</P>
<P>The author of the Review of Dr. John&s;on's Shake|&s;peare hath, it &s;eems, been committed to the cu&s;tody of the&s;e literary mirmidons, and formally proceeded again&s;t for a breach of privilege. The Doctor, we are told, was above being called to account by any private individual whatever; it being the highe&s;t indignity to the <HI>majority</HI> even to &s;u&s;pect the inability of a writer, whom they had been plea&s;ed to vote <HI>infallible.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="8">As a friend to the <HI>Reviewer,</HI> therefore, I take up the pen to defend his cau&s;e, and a&s;&s;ert the right of every citizen in the Republick of Letters, to think and write freely. To this I am particularly incited al&s;o, from a due &s;en&s;e that &s;uch freedom is become ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the pre&s;ent intere&s;ts of lite|rature; which are daily drooping under the dead weights of indolence, partiality, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible that the&s;e ob&s;tacles to the pro|gre&s;s of &s;cience, and the advancement of letters, are commonly called by other names. I well know that, in this age of civility and fal&s;e refinement, mere COURTESY is termed <HI>candour,</HI> CEREMONY is called <HI>po|litene&s;s,</HI> QUAINTNESS <HI>elegance,</HI> PEDANTRY <HI>erudition,</HI> and DULLNESS <HI>decency</HI> and <HI>decorum.</HI> On the other hand, SINCERITY is termed <HI>in&s;ult,</HI> CENSURE is called <HI>cruelty,</HI> and WIT and HUMOUR <HI>petulance</HI> and <HI>ill-man|ners.</HI> In the mean time a zeal for <HI>truth</HI> is looked upon as a kind of canine madne&s;s; and a heart-felt ve|neration for true genius and learning is de&s;pi&s;ed as a literary phrenzy. Thus are we degenerated from our forefathers; from the wits and philo&s;ophers of tho&s;e ages which produced a Shake&s;peare, a Bacon, a Dry|den, and a Milton; whom in&s;tead of imitating, we exert all our little abilities to depreciate, and level with the diminutive &s;tandard of the pre&s;ent times. A late noble writer ob&s;erves, re&s;pecting our moral and political character, that we are now-a-days &s;o far from having the <HI>virtues</HI> of great men, that we have not even their <HI>vices</HI>; every thing, &s;ays he, is little, mean, and pitiful among us. This might with greater ju&s;tice be &s;aid of our
<PB N="4" REF="9">
<HI>literary</HI> character; our ta&s;te for works of real genius, true &s;cience, and &s;olid erudition, being almo&s;t dwindled into nothing. In the mean time we &s;ee the petty pre|tenders to wit and learning indu&s;triou&s;ly forming them|&s;elves into parties for the &s;upport of each other, be|cau&s;e they find them&s;elves unable to &s;tand alone. Im|becillity naturally tends to render people complacent and civil; while the cunning, u&s;ually attendant on ig|norance, artfully teaches them to make a merit of their weakne&s;s, and to impute even their pu&s;illanimity to candour and benevolence.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that a writer, who hath the forti|tude alone to attack one of the greate&s;t of the&s;e par|tial and illiberal combinations, &s;hould create him&s;elf a number of enemies; nor is it indeed a wonder that the impartial publick &s;hould, for a while, be mi&s;led by the &s;elf intere&s;ted clamours, which &s;o numerous a body of parti&s;ans may rai&s;e again&s;t him. It is boldly pre|&s;umed, however, that if the publick &s;hould fully and coolly enquire into the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the motives for &s;uch attack, and the merits and demerits of the parties a&s;&s;ailed and defended, they will not only acquit the Reviewer of the fal&s;e charges of illiberality and malignity brought again&s;t him; but will be ready to acknowledge that the cha&s;ti&s;ement Dr. John&s;on hath received at his hands, is no le&s;s defen&s;ible with regard to its &s;everity, than it is ju&s;tifiable in re&s;pect to its cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Rea&s;ons for the Reviewer's having a le&s;s exalted opinion of Dr. J's abilities than has been entertained by the pub|lick in general.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE is nothing which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, gives us greater offence or di&s;gu&s;t, than to &s;ee tho&s;e per&s;ons or characters, for whom we have been u&s;ed to enter|tain a certain degree of re&s;pect, treated with familiarity or contempt. Nor is it at all nece&s;&s;ary to this end, that &s;uch treatment &s;hould on their part be merited. It is enough that we are ignorant of their demerits; of which it is afterwards very difficult to convince us, even by the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony. We are by no means ea&s;ily reconciled to &s;uch an in&s;tance of our want of &s;agacity, as that of having long entertained a favourable opinion, much le&s;s a kind of reverence, for an object unworthy of it. We are apt to he&s;itate, therefore, at the mo&s;t fla|grant proofs of our mi&s;take, and even to take offence at any &s;uppo&s;ed indignity offered to &s;uch characters, as if it in &s;ome mea&s;ure affected our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This hath been remarkably the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent af|fair of Mr. K's Review of Dr. John&s;on's Shake&s;peare; even tho&s;e, who could not fail of being convinced of the ju&s;tice of the Reviewer's remarks, finding in them|&s;elves &s;omething repugnant to the ludicrous and &s;ar|ca&s;tical manner in which Mr. K. had thought proper to reprehend this editor. Admitting for the pre&s;ent, how|ever, that the cau&s;e of &s;uch reprehen&s;ion was ju&s;t, they
<PB N="6" REF="11">
cannot fail, on reflection, to impute that repugnance to their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of Dr. J. and their igno|rance of the Reviewer's having &s;till farther motives for his &s;everity, than appeared on the face of his pamphlet.</P>
<P>That none of the&s;e motives were per&s;onal, the Re|viewer hath repeatedly and publickly declared. What they were, may be gathered from this and the follow|ing &s;ections.</P>
<P>The Reviewer, it &s;eems, had been &s;ome years abroad, when he fir&s;t heard of the publication of Dr. John&s;on's Dictionary; a work of which he had formed the highe&s;t expectations from the &s;uppo&s;ed abilities and great reputation of its author. At the &s;ame time, being apprehen&s;ive that his own application to the u&s;e of foreign languages might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, corrupt that of his native tongue, he procured Dr. J's appa|rently elaborate performance, in order to correct both his memory and judgment, as either might occa|&s;ionally fail him. Having thus, during an interval of &s;everal years, had more frequent occa&s;ions to con&s;ult an Engli&s;h dictionary, than po&s;&s;ibly would have hap|pened to him in any other &s;ituation, he could not fail of being greatly &s;urprized and di&s;appointed at the many palpable and gro&s;s mi&s;takes which had e&s;caped this ce|lebrated lexicographer. He was not &s;o unrea&s;onable to expect, indeed, that, in a work of &s;uch extent, a num|ber of trivial, and perhaps &s;ome important errors, &s;hould not e&s;cape the mo&s;t attentive and indu&s;trious compiler. He could neither expect, however, nor overlook &s;uch an amazing number of blunders and incon&s;i&s;tencies in etymology, orthoepy, idiom and grammatical con|&s;truction,
<PB N="7" REF="12">
as were to be found in a work, which was boa&s;ted of as a capital undertaking, and recommended to foreigners as a &s;tandard of the Engli&s;h lan|guage.</P>
<P>He would have been carele&s;s of the honour, and want|ing to the literature of his country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;pecially as he ob&s;erved that &s;ucceeding dictionary-writers, both abroad and at home, implicitly adopted the mo&s;t egregious errors on the authority of John&s;on. Sufficient proof of this may be had by an examination of Bailey's Dictionary, improved by Scott; Baretti's Italian and Engli&s;h Dictionary, and others.</NOTE>, had he not every where taken a proper occa&s;ion, therefore, to &s;peak of the defects and imperfections of Dr. John&s;on's Dictionary. At the &s;ame time, that he might not be thought to de|preciate the labours of another, without &s;ufficient cau&s;e, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf occa&s;ionally with forming a table of <HI>errata</HI> to that performance, intending &s;ome time or other to offer it to the proprietors; and, in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al to accept it, to lay it before the publick.</P>
<P>The Reviewer's li&s;t of errors was pretty copious when he returned to England; &s;ince when, having applied more clo&s;ely to literary matters, he hath increa&s;ed it almo&s;t tenfold, and that by no means to the honour of Dr. John&s;on's boa&s;ted erudition and profound know|ledge of the Engli&s;h tongue.</P>
<P>This detection of the <HI>Lexicographer</HI> induced the Re|viewer to make a clo&s;er examination, than he had be|fore done, into the compo&s;itions of the <HI>writer</HI>; in which were found the &s;ame traces of <HI>inattention</HI> to the idiom of our tongue, and of his imperfect acquaintance with other modern languages. In the mean time, he
<PB N="8" REF="13">
was found to be eternally aiming at the introduction of Latini&s;ms, and other vicious modes of expre&s;&s;ion, by way of <HI>enriching</HI> our tongue; but thereby corrupting it, as he him&s;elf &s;ays of Shake&s;peare, <Q>by almo&s;t every mode of depravation.</Q></P>
<P>In his productions of imagination, his invention ap|peared weak and languid. It exerted it&s;elf, indeed, now and then with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s in a <HI>dream</HI> or vi|&s;ion; but it was hardly ever wide awake, without &s;eem|ing fatigued with its efforts toward vigility, and invo|luntarily dropping into a doze again. As to his works of knowledge and judgment, there appeared hardly any trace of the author's acquaintance with the &s;ciences in any of his writings; nay, even his pre|tended profundity in morals, and the knowledge of mankind, &s;eemed to the Reviewer nothing more than a quaint and affected exhibition of the trite ob&s;erva|tions and hackney'd reflections of others.</P>
<P>His greate&s;t merit appeared to con&s;i&s;t in the labour thrown away on the tawdry glare of de&s;cription, and the glo&s;&s;y, but fading, poli&s;h of &s;tile. In&s;tead of pro|ducing great and noble images, he &s;eldom reached far|ther than high-&s;ounding words. In&s;tead of new and really elegant turns of thought, his novelty and refine|ment generally ended in &s;ome florid allu&s;ion, quaint antithe&s;is, or fanta&s;tical preci&s;ene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion. His ver&s;e &s;eemed heavy, cold and &s;piritle&s;s; and his pro&s;e alternately pompous and puerile.</P>
<P>A farther acquaintance with Dr. John&s;on's literary character, acquired even among and from his own
<PB N="9" REF="14">
friends, had by no means contributed to remove Mr. K's unfavourable opinion of this writer, when his long-expected edition of Shake&s;peare made its appearance.</P>
<P>Having been already &s;o egregiou&s;ly di&s;appointed as to the philological abilities of Dr. J. the Reviewer's expectations were by no means &s;o &s;anguine as before. His enthu&s;ia&s;tic veneration for Shake&s;peare, however, could not be re&s;trained within the bounds of &s;ilence, on finding this editor had taken every opportunity to depre|ciate the merit of that incomparable bard; on whom Dr. J. hath, in repeated in&s;tances, (as is &s;hewn in Mr. K's Review) endeavoured to fix the charge of <HI>incapacity, folly, vulgarity, immorality</HI> and <HI>impiety.</HI></P>
<P>To aggravate all this, Dr. J. falls with equal vio|lence on the only commentator on Shake&s;peare, that, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, hath acquitted him&s;elf with re|putation; charging him with <HI>weakne&s;s, ignorance, mean|ne&s;s, faithle&s;&s;ne&s;s, petulance</HI> and <HI>o&s;tentation.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who complain of Mr. K's &s;everity, and charge him with &s;currility, ill-manners and abu&s;e, would do well to look through his work, and &s;ee if they can find any pa&s;&s;age wherein he hath called Dr. J. <HI>mean, faithle&s;s, immoral</HI> or <HI>impious.</HI></P>
<P><Q>But Shake&s;peare and Theobald are <HI>dead,</HI> and Dr. John&s;on is <HI>alive</HI>; the former cannot &s;uffer by any thing that is &s;aid of them, whereas the latter may be e&s;&s;en|tially hurt by an attack on his reputation.</Q>
This may be urged, indeed, by tho&s;e who conceive Mr. K's exce&s;&s;ive zeal for the honour of the dead is le&s;s excu|&s;able than Dr. J's exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s for the reputa|tion of the living. It is very certain that, as they
<PB N="10" REF="15">
ari&s;e from different motives, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily inter|fere with, or counteract each other. It is difficult, indeed, to &s;ay which &s;avours mo&s;t of envy and malig|nity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very ju&s;lty ob&s;erved, however, by a late ingenious French writer; S'il e&s;t horrible d'in&s;ulter aux vivans combien plus odieux e&s;t il de fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rir la reputation des morts!</NOTE>. We may envy the reputation both of the living and the dead; but can hate only the living. Even hate, however, may ari&s;e from laudable principles, as hone&s;t men dete&s;t knaves, and lovers of truth abhor fal&s;e|hood: but envy, whether directed to the living or dead, is a mean and odious pa&s;&s;ion. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be univer&s;ally allowed more brave and honour|able, though it may be le&s;s prudential, to attack the reputation of the living than the dead. Now fortitude hath ever been e&s;teemed the general concomitant of ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and candour, which never harbour in envious minds.</P>
<P>So far Mr. K. hath evidently the advantage over Dr. J. Be&s;ides, the friends of the latter, while they charge the former with envy at Dr. J's abilities and re|putation, accu&s;e him at the &s;ame time with in&s;ufferable &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and vanity. But if the contempt with which he hath treated Dr. J. proceed really from his vanity and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, there is the le&s;s room to think him &s;ubject to the motives of envy; for we ne|ver can envy tho&s;e we truly de&s;pi&s;e. The truth, I imagine, is, that Mr. K. neither does the one nor the other by Dr. J. notwith&s;tanding he hath &s;ufficiently &s;hewn a fixed dete&s;tation of that editor's literary mi&s;|conduct. This dete&s;tation, as I ob&s;erved before, may neverthele&s;s be very ju&s;t and laudable; in which ca&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="16">
its effects cannot, with any propriety, be imputed to malignity.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now proceed to enquire how far Dr. John|&s;on may be defended from the &s;u&s;picion of envy, as the motive for his abu&s;e of Theobald and Shake&s;|peare.</P>
<P>As it behoves others, however, to exculpate the Doctor, I &s;hall only propo&s;e a few que&s;tions to tho&s;e of his friends, who may chu&s;e to an&s;wer them; &s;uch an&s;wers, in my opinion, tending effectually either to clear or convict him of acting from invidious motives.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Que&s;tions offered to Dr. John&s;on's friends, re&s;pecting &s;ome curious anecdotes of the life and literary conduct of that gentleman.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT hath been &s;aid, with regard to Dr. W-rb-r-t-n, that he abundantly de&s;erved the &s;currility and abu&s;e, which it is pretended Mr. K. hath thrown upon him;
<Q>becau&s;e he was the fir&s;t author who introduced &s;uch &s;oul language into controver&s;y, which he never failed to be&s;tow on all his opponents when he dared. But with Dr. John&s;on the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e; he never gave any public offence, nor even engaged in any controver&s;y.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who affirm all this, appear to know but very little of Dr. John&s;on; nay, even to forget the fact for which he is arraigned. Did he give no public offence in the circum&s;tances attending his edition of Shake&s;|peare?
<PB N="12" REF="17">
Did he not engage in a controver&s;y with almo&s;t all his commentators; be&s;towing the wor&s;t of foul language on his opponents when he dared; that is, on tho&s;e who were <HI>dead?</HI></P>
<P>The following queries, however, take in a farther retro&s;pect of Dr. J's literary conduct; the general te|nour of which will be found to be tinctured with an in|vidious di&s;po&s;ition, that he was fond of indulging in actions, which his timidity was too great to permit him openly to avow.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Whether Dr. J. de&s;erves better treatment than he has received; and how far Mr. K. is excu&s;able in having &s;o treated him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>DR. John&s;on's friends will doubtle&s;s object, that it is much ea&s;ier to a&s;k que&s;tions than to an&s;wer them, and that injurious inuendoes may be &s;afely conveyed in the way of query, even though they &s;hould be ground|le&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to a&s;k tho&s;e que&s;tions, however, had not Mr. K. furni&s;hed me with authen|ticated materials for making a &s;atisfactory reply to every &s;ingle article, if the Doctor, or his friends, &s;hould at any time require it. It was thought pro|per, in the mean time, to &s;tate the merits of Dr. J's literary character rather in a problematical than a
<PB N="17" REF="22">
peremptory manner, that his partizans might &s;olve any difficulties that might ari&s;e, in the be&s;t manner they are able. But if they cannot obviate &s;uch difficulties, and that very &s;oon, it is not to be doubted that the good &s;en&s;e ahd impartiality of the publick will pre|vail over its former prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and determine for me that Dr. J. hath met with no wor&s;e treatment than he de&s;erves.</P>
<P>How far Mr. K. is defen&s;ible in having inflicted it, is another matter of con&s;ideratioh. If the Reviewer, in the height of his zeal for the honour of Shake&s;peare, hath given too great a loo&s;e to his pa&s;&s;ions, and hath expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf unbecoming a &s;cholar and a gentle|man, he hath in &s;o doing injured his own reputation more than he hath done that of Dr. John&s;on. Nor is it any ju&s;tification of Mr. K's &s;currility to &s;ay it is a de|gree le&s;s &s;currilous than that of the Doctors J&mdash;n or W&mdash;n.</P>
<P>If their fault, however, be no ju&s;tification of his, it is &s;ome excu&s;e for the latter that it appears to be the natural effect of a re&s;entment excited by nobler and le&s;s intere&s;ted motives.</P>
<P>To attack a man, in the warmth of re&s;entment, however rudely, who is alive and able to defend him|&s;elf, is certainly le&s;s exceptionable, in point of honour and &s;pirit at lea&s;t, than a premeditated de&s;ign, con|ceived and executed in cold blood, to &s;trip the dead of tho&s;e honours which &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages had be&s;towed on their memory.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="23">It is to be ob&s;erved al&s;o, that it is not very ea&s;y for men of warm pa&s;&s;ions, when affected with their &s;ub|ject, to expre&s;s their re&s;entment in terms always con|&s;i&s;tent with the common forms of politene&s;s. Expe|rience &s;ufficiently evinces this, as we may be convinced by turning to almo&s;t any polemic writings, even on tho&s;e &s;ubjects which in a peculiar manner require the appearance at lea&s;t of the highe&s;t degree of temper and benevolence.</P>
<P>There is one cireum&s;tance, indeed, in which the Re|viewer &s;eems ju&s;tly to have incurred the cen&s;ure of impolitene&s;s and want of urbanity. This is the re|flection he hath made on a certain <HI>natural</HI> infirmity of Dr. J. In an&s;wer to this charge, however, it is to be ob&s;erved, that Mr. K. being per&s;onally a &s;tranger to the Doctor, and having formed the ideas of his character purely on the repre&s;entations of the Doctor's friends, he really mi&s;took that infirmity for an affected habit; as tho&s;e very friends, in repeating Dr. J's bons mots, con&s;tantly made u&s;e of the &s;ame habit or infir|mity to heighten the joke; and therefore may be as ju&s;tly &s;aid to have ridiculed it them&s;elves, as it is pre|tended Mr. K. has done. Nay, the Doctor's acquaintance are &s;till more inexcu&s;able, as they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have known the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and ought not to have given occa&s;ion for &s;uch a mi&s;take, in a writer who is ma&s;ter of &s;ufficient acrimony of &s;tile, without de&s;cending to ridicule per&s;onal defects, which he never could conceive to be ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24">Having now done with Dr. John&s;on's demerits, as well as the merits of Mr. K's Review, with regard to its &s;everity in general, I &s;hall proceed to take &s;ome notice of the principal objections that have been made to it by particular writers, e&s;pecially by the authors of the Critical Review, the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, the Candid Reviewers, and &s;ome few other volunteer criticks.</P>

<L>Some tricks of de&s;peration:</L></Q>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Kenrick is for &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>a fever of the mind.</HI> Mr. John&s;on is undoubtedly right in re&s;toring the old reading. Admitting it not to be quite idiomatical, yet it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trength &s;ufficient to maintain its place again&s;t mere con|jecture. <HI>Ex uno di&s;ce omnes.</HI> The re&s;t of his review of this play is of a piece with the &s;pecimens here exhibited.</P></Q></P>
<P>Here the Critical Reviewer's ip&s;e dixit gives the pre|ference to Dr. John&s;on's reading; but the misfortune is, that what the&s;e Criticks impute to Mr. K. is the reading of all the modern editions, and not Mr. Ken|rick's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, quoting this pa&s;|&s;age from Mr. K's Review, &s;ays, he would have it to be "<HI>The</HI> fever of the mad." An egregious proof this of the attention and capacity of the&s;e writers to correct Mr. K. who in fact only op|po&s;es Dr. John&s;on's reading in this pa&s;&s;age; advancing nothing of his own, except by way of mere hypothe&s;is.</NOTE>; &s;o that the reader hath here a mo&s;t notable in&s;tance of their judgment and impartiality in exhibit|ing the above two critici&s;ms as ju&s;t &s;pecimens of Mr. K's Review.</P>
<P>They proceed, neverthele&s;s, in the &s;ame magi&s;te|rial and dogmatical &s;tile to expo&s;e their own ignorance &s;till farther in the following pa&s;&s;ages. His, &s;ay they, that is, Mr. K's, "deriving the word <HI>feodary</HI> from the word <HI>foedus,</HI> a covenant, is an in&s;tance of ignorance hardly to be paralleled. The be&s;t Engli&s;h writers &s;ay <HI>feodum,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>feudum.</HI> A feodary therefore is one who <HI>owes</HI> &s;uit and &s;er|vice
<PB N="24" REF="29">
to his &s;uperior. Warburton's inaccuracy in &s;pell|ing the word <HI>feuda,</HI> which is the Scotti&s;h term, in&s;tead of <HI>feoda,</HI> has brought our Critick into a blunder. A feo|dary is no other than a <HI>&s;ervant,</HI> an <HI>agent</HI>; and the very in|&s;tance brought by this Reviewer from Cymbeline confirms it."</P>
<P>The word, who&s;e derivation is here di&s;puted, is, in &s;ome editions of Shake&s;peare, &s;pelt <HI>fedary,</HI> without the dipthong. Suppo&s;ing Mr. K. to be mi&s;taken, however, which I do not believe to be the ca&s;e, this in&s;tance of ignorance, as the critic calls it, is yet to be parallel'd, as he may &s;ee, by turning to Bailey's Dic|tionary, corrected and enlarged by Scot; where he will find the &s;en&s;e of the word, and even of the pa&s;&s;age quoted from Cymbeline, laid down in the &s;ame manner. <HI>Feuda</HI> may&punc; for ought I know, be a Scotti&s;h term, and it may in Scotland mean a &s;lave or &s;ervant; but neither Shake&s;peare nor Mr. K. wrote Scotch, but Engli&s;h; of which it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for a Scotchman ever to be a <HI>compleat</HI> ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The next offence the&s;e criticks take at Mr. K's il|lu&s;tration is his philo&s;ophical explanation of the word <HI>warps</HI> in the famous &s;ong of <HI>Blow thou winter's wind.</HI> On which occa&s;ion they expre&s;s them&s;elves as follows:</P>
<P>"What a pity it is that this writer's whole di&s;play of cri|tical and natural knowledge &s;hould be entirely thrown away; &s;ince nothing is more certain, than that Shake&s;peare meant no more by <HI>warping,</HI> but <HI>fixing</HI> or <HI>freezing</HI> the waters. The allu&s;ion is drawn from the operation of weavers, who <HI>warp,</HI> that is, <HI>fix</HI> their wor&s;ted or yarn in their looms before they work it."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="30">But, how is it certain that Shake&s;peare meant <HI>no more but</HI> fixing or <HI>freezing</HI>; when there is no proof that he meant even that: for, unle&s;s the&s;e criticks can produce the te&s;timony of one Engli&s;h writer, or even one Engli&s;h <HI>weaver,</HI> to prove that the term <HI>warp,</HI> as related to the <HI>woof,</HI> is u&s;ed as a verb, nobody can give into their notion of the allu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervation affords a remarkable in|&s;tance of the mode&s;ty and learning of the&s;e critical gentry:</P>
<P>&mdash;"After all Mr. Kenrick's exultations at the di&s;covery of the meaning of the word <HI>l'envoy,</HI> in <HI>Love's Labour lo&s;t,</HI> his etymology is but fanta&s;tical; nor is it ju&s;tified by the Tre|voux Dictionary, which &s;eems to be the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of his French learning."</P>
<P>Indeed! &mdash; In the fir&s;t place, Mr. Critick, you tell a notorious untruth in a&s;&s;erting a thing you know no|thing of: you have looked, I &s;uppo&s;e, into the <HI>Dictio|naire de Trevoux,</HI> and becau&s;e you cannot find &s;uch etymology ju&s;tified by that work, you flatly affirm it to be fanta&s;tical, and very logically conclude that, be|cau&s;e one Reviewer's French learning extends no far|ther than the Trevoux Dictionary, another's mu&s;t be confined to the &s;ame limits.

When we reflect, that he &s;teps a&s;ide and conceals him&s;elf in a bu&s;h, while he di&s;covers the lovers, &s;o as to be as invi|&s;ible as a <HI>gnat,</HI> the badne&s;s of the rhimes is removed by reading <HI>gnat</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>knot</HI>; but this is mere conjecture.</Q>
<P>It is really very good of the&s;e gentlemen to give &s;uch a <HI>paultry ob&s;erver</HI> as Mr. K. credit for any thing; e&s;|pecially as they had nothing better to offer than mere conjecture. But the wor&s;t on it is, that this conjecture was long ago conjectured by Mr. Pope, who adopted the &s;ame reading for the &s;ake of the rhime. This, however, it is po&s;&s;ible the&s;e criticks on the critick of the editors of Shake&s;peare knew nothing at all about.</P>
<P>I come now to the more &s;erious part of the offence, which the&s;e criticks have both taken and given, with regard to Mr. K's performance. This is the pa&s;&s;age immediately &s;ucceeding the above; in which, admitting
<PB N="27" REF="32">
that Dr. J's note is a <HI>vile</HI> one, they proceed to in&s;inuate that Mr. K. in his reprehen&s;ion of it, hath forfeited his preten&s;ions to <HI>honour, &s;pirit</HI> and <HI>virtue.</HI> Nay, rea|der, don't laugh; it is really the <HI>Critical</HI> Reviewers, who, in this very article, "have entered their caveat again&s;t <HI>illiberal</HI> critici&s;m," and talk about <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI>; even tho&s;e, who&s;e critici&s;m hath heretofore been deemed l&mdash;s, and as &s;uch puni&s;hed accordingly. You will &s;ay, perhaps, that they are reformed; that they have &s;ince authorized their printer to pay fifty pounds, out of his own pocket, to any per&s;on who can bring legal proof of their having taken money for the in&s;ertion of partial characters of books and authors, although they own it has been offered them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their late adverti&s;ement in&s;erted in the news-papers, as al&s;o on the cover of the Critical Review, wi&s;ely to inform the country reader of the high e&s;teem in which the Reviewers were held in town. It is well for them, indeed, that their rage of ju&s;|tification did not induce them to promi&s;e a reward for proving the editor guilty of receiving and in&s;erting anonymous articles, which might, for ought he knew, be written by the authors of the books them&s;elves: becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, there might have been brought &s;uch damning proof, as might have made them tremble for the offered premium.</NOTE>. What an in&s;tance this la&s;t of their integrity, impartiality and <HI>virtue!</HI> &mdash; Very true, indeed, and I firmly believe that they never did take any pecuniary bribe on this ac|count; for, though I am acquainted with many mer|cenary book&s;ellers, and as many vain authors, yet I don't know one, whom I think fool enough to value the be&s;t character they could give of his performance at three farthings. I will not contradict them po&s;itively indeed, and &s;ay that not one &s;uch is to be found; but
<PB N="28" REF="33">
it happens extremely unlucky that the&s;e criticks, in thinking to do them&s;elves honour, &s;hould confe&s;s a thing that cannot fail to entail on them di&s;grace. They own that money hath been offered them, though they had &s;o much <HI>virtue</HI> as to refu&s;e to take it. Does not this circum&s;tance alone &s;ufficiently evince what opinion the per&s;ons, offering the bribe, mu&s;t have of tho&s;e to whom it was offered? &mdash; Oh! fie! fie! for &s;hame! never make this confe&s;&s;ion again, whether true or fal&s;e, as you value your very exi&s;tence. <HI>Virtus po&s;t mortem</HI> may &s;erve well enough for a motto to the atchieve|ment of a dead chee&s;emonger; but the virtue even of a Critical Reviewer is not worth a groat to an author, who is damned while he is alive.</P>
<P>For decency's &s;ake be a little con&s;i&s;tent; and, for the future, beware of extolling the works of &s;trangers to the &s;kies, and of endeavouring afterwards to drag them down again, when you find &s;uch writers know too much to be vain of your prai&s;es, and are too &s;in|cere to become your friends.

<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, impartiality, and urbanity of Syl|vanus Urban, Gent. regarding the writings of Mr. K. and particularly his Review of Dr. John&s;on's Shake|&s;peare.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY body knows who was the original Sylva|nus Urban, hone&s;t Cave, who, little as he knew of li|terature or &s;cience him&s;elf, had yet &s;o much knowledge and di&s;cretion as to &s;et a ju&s;t value on his friends and corre&s;pondents, and behave to them at lea&s;t with gra|titude and common decency. When the nece&s;&s;ity, in|deed, of employing per&s;ons of &s;uperior genius and learning obliged him to lean on &s;ome right-hand-man, he could not always be accountable for what he was urged to do by others. In time Sylvanus Urban be|came
<PB N="31" REF="36">
a mere &s;hadow; and the good-will of his friends was liable to be perverted by the caprice, ignorance, or ill-will of his journeymen-editors. How far the pre&s;ent Sylvanus is his own friend, in admitting of &s;uch a perver&s;ion, time hath already evinced in &s;ome degree, and will daily exhibit more plainly. Before I proceed any farther, however, I &s;hall in&s;ert Mr. Urban's ac|count of Mr. K's Review.</P>
<Q><P>This piece is written with a malignity for which it is very difficult to account, as the authour declares that he is a &s;tranger to Dr. John&s;on, and never received any offence from him. If his ill-will ari&s;es from envy of the literary honour Dr. John&s;on has acquired, or the mark of di&s;tinction he has received from his &s;overeign, he is too much an object of pity to move any other pa&s;&s;ion in the brea&s;t either of Dr. John&s;on, or his friends <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the writer of this paragraph &s;u&s;pects Mr. K. of the above|mentioned motives from any thing his own heart &s;ugge&s;ts to him, he is him&s;elf too much, and too mean a wretch to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> pity. And that he could have any other grounds, on which to form &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, he is called upon to make appear.</NOTE>. He has treated the bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter with the &s;ame acrimony that he has treated Dr. John&s;on, yet he declares he has him&s;elf &s;ome literary reputation which he would not wantonly hazard, being the author of two tran&s;la|tions from the French, be&s;ides &s;everal anonymous pieces, which, he &s;ays him&s;elf, are too numerous to be good <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Is this true? &mdash; Is this a &s;pecimen of Mr. Urban's ingenuou&s;|ne&s;s, impartiality and veracity? The truth is, that Mr. K. in the Preface to his Review, &s;peaking of his not &s;tanding exactly in the &s;ame predicament with the author of the Canons of Critici&s;m, who had never written any thing before that piece, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to add the following note, which the reader will &s;ee Mr. Urban has not only mutilated and mi&s;repre&s;ented, but hath given it the mo&s;t invidious turn.</P>
<Q>In confirmation of what is here a&s;&s;erted, it may po&s;&s;ibly be thought nece&s;&s;ary to name &s;ome of tho&s;e publications, on which the public have conferred the honour of a favourable reception.&mdash; It is pre&s;umed needle&s;s, however, to particularize performances that would certainly have been le&s;s faulty, had they been le&s;s nu|merous. The author contents him&s;elf, therefore, with men|tioning only his Epi&s;tles to Lorenzo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Can any thing be more pitiful and mean than the omi&s;&s;ion of the name of this work, with a view to repre&s;ent Mr. K. as a mere tran&s;lator? It is al&s;o fooli&s;h as mean, for how long did this <HI>ingenuous</HI> critick think this expedient would &s;erve him? Did he think, becau&s;e when Mr. K. was an anonymous writer, he de&s;pi&s;ed the&s;e little artifices too much to take notice of them, that when he had by name attacked their <HI>chief,</HI> he would not take an opportunity to cru&s;h his pitiful dependents? Or did they imagine that, if Mr. K. &s;hould think them beneath his re&s;entment, he would find none to join him in &s;o good a cau&s;e? Could they conceive there was nobody who, while he was roa&s;ting the colo&s;&s;us like an over-grown turkey-cock, for the entertainment of the publick, would take the trouble to &s;pit a dozen or two of his emi&s;&s;aries, by way of larks, to garni&s;h the di&s;h withal: &mdash; This critick was mi&s;taken every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. &mdash;</NOTE>; and the Tran&s;lation of Rou&s;&s;eau's Eloi&s;a and Emilius.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37">This work con&s;i&s;ts principally of &s;everal conjectures<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; Mr. K. having propo&s;ed very few conjectures; his work con&s;i&s;ting principally of rational illu&s;trations of the poet, or proofs po&s;itive of the ignorance of his commentators.</NOTE>, which he has &s;ub&s;tituted for the conjectures of the Bi&s;hop and Dr. John&s;on, frequently with as much confidence as if they were truths received by revelation, and confirmed by mi|racle <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Well, and what then? Why may not a writer &s;peak confi|dently when he is convinced he is in the right? And I don't find that either Mr. Urban, or any other of Dr. John&s;on's friends, will venture to go aboot to prove Mr. K. in the wrong. They may rail in general terms; but if they meddle with particulars, they will po&s;&s;ibly only expo&s;e their own nakedne&s;s, and be laughed at with the Critical Reviewers.&mdash;But Mr. K. &s;peaks, &s;ays this <HI>maga|ziner,</HI> as if his critici&s;ms were truths
<Q>received by revelation, and confirmed by miracle.</Q>
If he received them by revelation, however, I pre&s;ume there was no manner of occa&s;ion for his hav|ing them confirmed by miracle, to warrant his confidence. Their production was, neverthele&s;s, &s;o far miraculous, that they were writ|ten in fewer days than Dr. John&s;on took years to compleat his work: a circum&s;tance which &s;ome wi&s;eacres, who never &s;aw them, urged publickly, as a proof they could be good for nothing; becau&s;e, &s;aid they,
<Q>a man of moderate genius could not read the book in the time that Mr. K. <HI>&s;tans pede in uno</HI> had produced a confutation of it.</Q>
But while the ju&s;tice of Mr. K's critici&s;ms in general remain inconte&s;tible, I leave the publick to judge, whether the rapidity of their compo&s;ition redounds mo&s;t to his credit or his di&s;honour.</NOTE>; of the&s;e we &s;hall give &s;uch a &s;pecimen as will
<PB N="33" REF="38">
enable the reader to judge of the re&s;t, beginning where the author begins, that our impartiality may not be brought into que&s;tion.</P></Q>
<P>Would not any indifferent per&s;ons, who &s;hould read the above pa&s;&s;age, imagine at lea&s;t that the writer of it never once heard of the Reviewer, or his writings, in his life? But are not Dr. H&mdash;h and Mr. H&mdash;y the editors and managers of the Gentleman's Maga|zine? And is it po&s;&s;ible that neither of the&s;e gentlemen remember that Mr. K. hath been an occa&s;ional contri|butor to their work from a very &s;chool-boy? And is this a &s;pecimen of the manners with which they treat a corre&s;pondent, for whom they have more than once expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t regard; and for who&s;e <HI>valuable contributions</HI> (as they have called them) they have even offered pecuniary gratifications, which he never conde|&s;cended to accept? I have now in my hands &s;ufficient proofs of what is here intimated, and the Gentleman's Magazine affords various others of the <HI>acknowledged</HI> value of the papers Mr. K. hath &s;ent it, re&s;pecting very different branches of &s;cience and literature.</P>
<P>Can the managers of that work be &s;o mean and &s;elf-intere&s;ted, as to treat Mr. K. in this &s;candalous manner, becau&s;e he has of late years been induced to favour other periodical works of the like kind? They can have no other motive, unle&s;s it be their clo&s;er attach|ment to Dr. J. But, however they may have been
<PB N="34" REF="39">
obliged to that gentleman, and whatever opinion they may have of his literary abilities, are candour, truth and ju&s;tice, all to give way to their partiality for him? Are the talents and reputations of the Doctors John&s;on and H&mdash;h &s;o very bulky, that tho&s;e both of the dead and the living mu&s;t be mangled, mutilated and de|pre&s;&s;ed, in order to allow them room enough to va|pour in? Surely the recent lo&s;s of a <HI>Lloyd</HI> and a <HI>Chur|chill</HI> might have rendered them a <HI>little</HI> more at ea&s;e in &s;o wide a world! But, no. They are determined to have the univer&s;e to them&s;elves and their partizans; condemning every one to defamation or ob&s;curity, who does not enli&s;t under the banner of the colo&s;&s;us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among numerous in&s;tances that might be brought of Mr. Urban's mi&s;behaviour in this kind to Mr. K. I &s;hall only mention two or three; which, though beneath his own notice, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of tho&s;e <HI>little arts,</HI> by which &s;ome modern writers have wriggled them&s;elves into fame, and endeavoured to ob&s;cure the dawning reputation of others. It is remarkable that the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine hath of late years carefully avoided mentioning the very name of Mr. K. though formerly plea&s;ed to print it in large capitals to a puerile and in&s;ignificant performance, in&s;erted &s;o long ago as the year 1748.&mdash;He hath been as cautious al&s;o of mentioning the <HI>Epi&s;tles to Lorenzo,</HI> a work of e&s;tabli&s;hed credit, not only in the pitiful in&s;tance before-given, but even in his li&s;t of books at the time of its publication.&mdash;When he thought pro|per al&s;o lately to reprint the fable, entitled, <HI>Rea&s;on and Imagination,</HI> (written by the CELEBRATED <HI>Mr. Chri&s;topher Smart,</HI> as he him&s;elf &s;tiles that gentleman) and addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. K. he judged it expe|dient even to mutilate that piece, in order to omit the addre&s;s, as well as the following elegant compliment which is paid to Mr. K. at the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<Q><L>O, <HI>Kenrick!</HI> happy in the view,</L>

<L>With thoughts at once <HI>re&s;train'd</HI> and <HI>free:</HI></L>
<L>I dedicate this tale to thee.</L></Q>
<P>At another time this editor promi&s;ed his readers an ab&s;tract of what he called a <HI>very &s;en&s;ible</HI> anonymous pamphlet, written by Mr. K. but, having learned the name of the author before the next month's magazine appeared, he &s;omehow forgot his promi&s;e, and po&s;&s;ibly has not recollected it to this day. And yet, during all this time, not the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion was neglected in which Mr. Urban could compliment Dr. John&s;on or Dr. Hawk&s;worth. But I fear my readers are &s;ufficiently di&s;gu&s;ted at the recapitulation of &s;uch minute and pitiful artifices, which are as di&s;graceful to the profe&s;&s;ion of letters in general, as to tho&s;e who practi&s;e them in particular.</P>
<P>I &s;hould otherwi&s;e mention &s;ome more &s;erious and impor|tant cau&s;es of complaint, proceeding obviou&s;ly from the &s;ame &s;ource, which Mr. K. hath farther to exhibit again&s;t the editor and manager of this magazine.&mdash;</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="40">They are here given to know, however, that Mr. K. dete&s;ts all combinations in literature, as much as he de&s;pi&s;es the monopoli&s;ts of fame.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Remarks on the &s;trictures of the Candid Reviewers, and the other volunteer criticks that have taken upon them to abu&s;e the Reviewer of Dr. J's Shake&s;peare.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is &s;omething remarkable that, among all the wri|ters, who have drawn the pen on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, again&s;t Mr. K. not one of them hath ventured to take the part of Dr. J. The <HI>critical</HI> Reviewers, we have &s;een, give him up entirely; even Mr. Urban him&s;elf &s;ays nothing in his defence. The pretended acrimony of Mr. K's manner, indeed, is di&s;approved by all par|ties; but this I have already endeavoured to ju&s;tify. I &s;hall proceed, therefore, to enquire how far tho&s;e, which are as yet unnoticed, are ju&s;tifiable in <HI>their</HI> man|ner of treating Mr. K.&mdash;To begin with the <HI>Candid</HI> Reviewers. The&s;e <HI>hone&s;t</HI> gentlemen, who have bor|rowed the whole of Mr. K's preface, as they did the month before the greater part of Dr. J's, have given &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tent and motley account of the <HI>Re|viewer</HI>'s performance, that it is very difficult to &s;ay whether they have mo&s;t prai&s;ed or cen&s;ured it.</P>
<P>In its <HI>favour</HI> they &s;ometimes admit, that "the matter of it does demand the highe&s;t approbation." That "Dr. John&s;on will find him&s;elf <HI>unable</HI> to reply to it."&mdash;That "Mr. Kenrick has very &s;ufficiently &s;hewn that Dr. John&s;on has played booty throughout his boa&s;ted edition."&mdash;That "Mr. K. hath improved upon Dr. J."&mdash;That "they agree with Mr. K. that
<PB N="41" REF="46">
Shake&s;peare &s;till &s;tands as much in need of a new edi|tion as ever."&mdash;That "he hath happily &s;ucceeded in giving, by means of an ea&s;y interpretation, a con|&s;i&s;tent meaning to &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, in regard to which other interpreters have run after far-fetched explica|tions."&mdash;That "they entirely agree with him in the &s;imple &s;en&s;e he gives to words, and join with him in wondering how Warburton and others could ever puz|zle them&s;elves &s;o much about them," &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In its <HI>disfavour,</HI> they in&s;inuate that "Mr. K. has Committed blunders as well as other men, who bragged as much, witne&s;s poor Dr. Warburton."&mdash;That "Mr. K. has &s;ometimes mi&s;apprehended his author's meaning, as well as Dr. John&s;on."&mdash;That "future ob&s;ervers will improve on Mr. K, and that he is therefore not fit to publi&s;h an edition of Shake&s;peare."&mdash;That "Mr. K. in&s;tead of profiting by his own admonitions, &s;ome|times commits the &s;ame faults he blames in others."&mdash; That they cannot help expre&s;&s;ing "their admiration at the ble&s;&s;ed effects which metaphy&s;ics and philo&s;ophy have upon critici&s;m in poetry!" intimating thereby that Mr. K. is too much of a philo&s;opher to know any thing of poetry.&mdash;That Mr. K. di&s;plays great inability in tracing out the beauty of poetic images, and that his remarks are ridiculous.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter upon a confutation of the a&s;&s;ertions of the&s;e critics; the in&s;tances in which they pre&s;ume to differ from Mr. K. being, to the la&s;t degree, ab|&s;urd and contemptible; as the reader may conclude from their affirming, in the cour&s;e of their critical in|ve&s;tigation, that Shake&s;peare had no knowledge of a
<PB N="42" REF="47">
<HI>climax,</HI> which they are plea&s;ed to term a rhetorical gorgon-faced word. They have &s;agaciou&s;ly di&s;covered al&s;o that Shake&s;peare acted, with <HI>very little</HI> judgment, in the execution of one of his greate&s;t ma&s;ter-pieces of art. But this is &s;ufficient with regard to their lite|rary &s;trictures: I come now to their per&s;onal ones; and here they charge Mr. K. with having de&s;cended to make u&s;e of "&s;currility, abu&s;ive and even low-lived <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Does not this polite epithet &s;erve to &s;hew, that the writer him&s;elf mu&s;t undoubtedly be a per&s;on in <HI>high-life? Ex ungue leo|nem.</HI> This critic, to &s;peak in his own dialect, mu&s;t certainly be a gentleman of <HI>three cuts.</HI> Low-lived! Could ever one have thought of &s;uch a word's getting into print, and that by means of a profe&s;&s;ed critic too! <HI>O tempora! O mores!</HI> Proud, however, as this gentleman may be of the <HI>Dignity and Advantages of living in a Garret</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an ingenious pamphlet, publi&s;hed &s;ome years ago, with this title.</NOTE>, I would not advi&s;e him to riot too luxuriou&s;ly on rich &s;auces. Spartan broth is a &s;timulating aliment, e&s;|pecially when &s;ea&s;oned with garlick. Tho&s;e who live <HI>high</HI> &s;el|dom live <HI>long.</HI> Nay, my mind forebodes that, even while I am now writing, this &s;on of <HI>Candour</HI> is no more. The death-watch ticks&mdash;'tis even &s;o&mdash;hark, I hear his knell&mdash;poor-devil! His &s;pirit is departed. 'Twere a dirty piece of work, or I would rip him up, and pre&s;erve his carca&s;e, like that of Duke Humphry, in pickle. If any charitable hand will do it for him, it mu&s;t be &s;teeped well in the acrimony of Mr. K's Review. That may po&s;|&s;ibly keep it awhile above-ground. But alas! what pickle can long pre&s;erve a body, that, for want of proper &s;tamina, never was wholly alive; and, by the time it was half dead, was quite rotten! A&s;hes to a&s;hes; dirt unto dirt; &s;uch is the end of modern <HI>candour</HI>!</NOTE> petulance," with "ribaldry," with "bragging," with "foul language," with "being habituated to abu&s;ive blu&s;tering," with "wanting a pen&s;ion to &s;top his mouth," with "being a voracious boreas," with "be|ing a literary brui&s;er," with "fighting tooth and nail
<PB N="43" REF="48">
like dogs and bears," and finally with "being a whim|&s;ical, lynx-eyed, critico-poetico-metaphy&s;ico-magico philo&s;opher."</P>
<P>The reader will judge for him&s;elf how far a &s;et of critics, who are &s;o admirably well &s;killed in calling names, are to be credited in charging any writer with <HI>&s;currility, petulance, ribaldry</HI> and <HI>foul-language</HI>; words, I can a&s;&s;ure him, that are not to be found in Mr. K's Review! But it is not only again&s;t &s;uch critics, as pretend to have read his performance, that Mr. K. hath ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. There are tho&s;e who condemn both him and his Review, without &s;eeing or knowing any thing of either, except what is told them by Dr. John&s;on's partizans. Nay, &s;everal of the&s;e <HI>candid</HI> and <HI>impartial</HI> gentry began to rail openly in the public news-papers, at &s;ight of Mr. K's adverti&s;ement only. The terms of this, truly, were highly inde|cent; it was a kind of high-trea&s;on, a &s;pecies of im|piety, even to imagine Dr. John&s;on could be <HI>ignorant</HI> or <HI>inattentive.</HI> One would have thought him placed at the head of literature, as the Roman pontiff is at the head of his church, and with the &s;ame preten&s;ions to infallibility. Every body, for&s;ooth, was expected to ki&s;s pope John&s;on's toe, even at the hazard of hav|ing their fore-teeth kicked out by his holine&s;s's bruta|lity. But Mr. K. had never any inclination to be treated in &s;o gro&s;s a manner, as that in which he had heard Dr. J. had taken the liberty to behave towards &s;ome per|&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank in the world of &s;cience and letters. It was re&s;erved for him, indeed, to pay the doctor in his own coin, and avenge the repeated in&s;ults received
<PB N="44" REF="49">
by injured mode&s;ty. To appeal to fact, however, in &s;upport of what is above a&s;&s;erted, Mr. K's Review was hardly publi&s;hed before a letter, &s;igned <HI>J. May,</HI> appeared in the London Chronicle, evidently founded on the adverti&s;ement only, in which Mr. K. was charged in gro&s;s terms with making u&s;e of FOUL-MOUTHED <HI>language,</HI> of want of <HI>decency, good-manners,</HI> and I know not what.&mdash;What a <HI>fine-mouthed,</HI> &s;mooth-tongued, poli&s;hed generation is the pre&s;ent! This Mr. Sweet-lips was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, "Whatever judg|ment the public may entertain of the late edition of Shake&s;peare, the editor is too well known, to have the charge of ignorance &s;o ea&s;ily admitted again&s;t him."&mdash; Doubtle&s;s he is; and it would in no &s;hape have an|&s;wered the Reviewer's end for the public to have been &s;atisfied by his adverti&s;ement without reading his book.&mdash;By the readine&s;s, however, with which Mr. May, and indeed all Dr. J's friends, &s;eem to give up the editor of Shake&s;peare, there is great rea&s;on to pre|&s;ume Mr. K. did not promi&s;e more in the news-papers than he effected in his pamphlet. So that it appears Dr. J. is not &s;o well <HI>known</HI> as this gentleman &s;uppo&s;es. His name, indeed, is in every body's mouth, and it is po&s;&s;ible there are few of tho&s;e, whom, from their fondne&s;s for <HI>fine writers,</HI> we may with propriety enough call <HI>fine readers,</HI> who have not yawned with drow&s;y admiration over tho&s;e quaint and in|&s;ipid performances, <HI>Irene</HI> and the <HI>Idler.</HI> But the&s;e works &s;upport but a &s;mall part of Dr. John&s;on's literary reputation: the foundation of which is laid &s;o deep in the rubbi&s;h of erudition, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="45" REF="50">
for &s;uch &s;uperficial readers to di&s;cover it. Like the &s;pectator of the invi&s;ible cock, however, Mr. <HI>May</HI> &s;eems to be very &s;ure it is there.&mdash;This &s;ame Mr. J. May, al&s;o, takes farther upon him to a&s;k
<Q>who is this W. K. who &s;o rudely &s;teps forth from &mdash; nobody knows where, to attack a gentleman of known literary abilities?</Q>
&mdash;This gentleman mu&s;t have very few connections, and know little of what is doing, in the literary world, to have any occa&s;ion to a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion. For, whoever <HI>he</HI> be, or where|ever <HI>he</HI> comes from, Mr. K. may certainly &s;ay with propriety to HIM, <HI>Not to know me argues thy&s;elf unknown.</HI> But perhaps this gentleman, like the editor of Lloyd's Chronicle, and &s;ome other writers, who af|fected, on the like occa&s;ion, to &s;peak of <HI>one Mr. K.</HI> as if an utter &s;tranger to his exi&s;tence, may only know him too well, having before &s;marted from the ju&s;t &s;e|verity of his critical pen. If &s;o, Mr. May is an&s;wered; if not, and he was really de&s;irous of knowing &s;ome|thing of Mr. K. he may have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, gra|tified his curio&s;ity in the peru&s;al of the foregoing &s;heets.</P>
<P>The next gentleman I &s;hall take notice of (which &s;hall be the la&s;t, as there would be no end of pur&s;uing anonymous writers) is one Mr. Hypercriticus, who, about the &s;ame time, without ever having &s;een Mr. K's book, was incited to publi&s;h, among other &s;agacious reflections, the following wi&s;e &s;entences.
<Q>From the very &s;hort time &s;ince the publication of Mr. John|&s;on's edition of Shake&s;peare, and from the very ra|pid
<PB N="46" REF="51">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another of Dr. J's friends is angry with Mr. K. for a like rea&s;on, remarking, as before ob&s;erved, that Mr. K. <HI>&s;tans pede in uno</HI> wrote his Review of Dr. John&s;on's book, before a per&s;on of a moderate capacity could read it.&mdash;But if Mr. K. is generally in the right, and Dr. J. in the wrong, I don't &s;ee how this reflects any di&s;grace on the former. On the contrary, if Mr. K. <HI>&s;tans pede in uno</HI> hath given &s;uch a broad-footed colo&s;&s;us as Dr. J. a fall, it &s;hews him to be no bad wre&s;tler. So &s;tand clear, if you are upon the <HI>offen&s;ive.</HI>&mdash;</NOTE> progre&s;s of Mr. Kenrick's remarks thereon, I <HI>believe</HI> they mu&s;t be crude and imperfect.</Q> Believe! quoth he, Is not this very candid and ingenuous? But he proceeds to give a rea&s;on for the faith that is in him.
<Q>For to pa&s;s a right judgment on books (&s;ays Longinus) requires a great length of time, and a perfect knowledge of the &s;ubject.</Q>
Well, and what then? The writings of Shake&s;peare might have been the object of Mr. K's &s;tudy for years, and he might thence have acquired (at lea&s;t for what Hyper|criticus knew to the contrary) a perfect knowledge of the &s;ubject; and if &s;o, no longer time would be re|qui&s;ite for him to point out Dr. John&s;on's mi&s;takes, than was nece&s;&s;ary to read his book. But, &s;ays this gentleman,
<Q>I <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> Mr. K. is a critick by intui|tion; one who, in regard to books, &s;ees into the merit of the whole, by reading only a part.</Q>
As we had before a <HI>believe</HI> here we have a <HI>&s;uppo&s;e.</HI> Are not the&s;e very pretty grounds to proceed on, to the condemnation of a writer unread. But how, if what I ju&s;t now a&s;&s;erted be true, that Shake&s;peare's writings have been many years the favourite object of Mr. K's reading and &s;tudy; how, if he hath long &s;ince accumulated materials for an edition of that poet, as
<PB N="47" REF="52">
is al&s;o true; I &s;ay, how, Mr. Hypercriticus, in this ca&s;e, can you ju&s;tify your precipitate cen&s;ures, and what becomes of your <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI>? And to &s;uppo&s;e for once it was not &s;o, &s;urely Mr. K. might, as you &s;ay, judge of the <HI>whole</HI> by reading a <HI>part,</HI> with as much propriety as you judge of his performance by reading only his adverti&s;ement in the news-papers? Why might not he be, without a <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> a critick intuitively as well as you? But "&s;arca&s;m, you &s;ay, is unmannerly." I wi&s;h, that where you learned to be &s;o very <HI>mannerly,</HI> you had only learned al&s;o to be equally <HI>ingenuous</HI>; you would have &s;aved me the trouble, and your&s;elf the mortification, of this reprehen&s;ion.

As to the former, Mr. K. is too hardy to feel their puny efforts to offend him; and, as to the latter he cannot help &s;miling to &s;ee, how ea|&s;ily their pellets dry and rub out, while they them&s;elves are begrimed up to the ears, in vainly endeavouring to be&s;patter him.</P>
<P>Having now done with particular altercation, I &s;hould here leave both Mr. K. and Dr. J. to &s;tand or fall by the judgment of the publick, had there not been &s;ome &s;trictures let fall in &s;ome of the papers levelled again&s;t Mr. K. charging him with as great a want of <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI> as he hath done Dr. J. with want of <HI>knowledge.</HI> I &s;hall therefore beg leave to &s;ay a word or two on both the&s;e topicks, viz. on the <HI>mode&s;ty of men of letters,</HI> and on <HI>literary knowledge.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the mode&s;ty of men of letters.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF all kinds of <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI> whether real or affected, perhaps that of <HI>Authors</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;ingular. <HI>A mode&s;t Author</HI>! It is a kind of contradiction in terms, and &s;ounds to my ear exactly like the expre&s;&s;ion of a <HI>mode&s;t &s;trumpet.</HI> There is no doubt that a man may be a mode&s;t man before he commence writer, as a gentle|man may be an hone&s;t gentleman before he be made mini&s;ter-of-&s;tate, or as even a butcher may have &s;ome bowels of compa&s;&s;ion before he turn bum-bailiff; but no &s;ooner are they initiated into the <HI>routine</HI> of their re&s;pective offices, than mode&s;ty, hone&s;ty, and huma|nity take flight and leave them.</P>
<P>This is &s;evere, you will &s;ay.&mdash;It is &s;o; but it is ne|verthele&s;s founded in truth, and may be applied to many writers now living, and probably likely to live &s;o long as they can get any thing by pro&s;tituting either their talents or reputation.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that a clo&s;er parallel can hardly be drawn between any two known characters, than between a common &s;cribbler and a common &s;trumpet. How ba&s;hfully doth the young enamorato of the mu&s;es look at you, when you &s;peak to him about publi&s;h|ing his fir&s;t production; even as an innocent country|wench blu&s;hes up to the eyes, when you fir&s;t talk of untying her garter! But when they have been a while tumbled over in the &s;heets, the virgin-mode&s;ty
<PB N="49" REF="54">
of both is pretty equal. There is this difference be|tween them, indeed, that the one grows bold by lo|&s;ing reputation, and the other by gaining it. This difference, however, does not in the lea&s;t alter their conduct or appearance when they come upon the town: the reputation then aimed at by both, being very dif|ferent from what they either lo&s;t or gained. The one &s;eeks not to improve his talents any more than the other her charms; but both apply a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to di&s;|play and make the mo&s;t of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and if they covet fame, it is generally with a &s;econdary view to the venal purpo&s;es of pro&s;titution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus an author, who&s;e abilities are exhau&s;ted, and a cour|tezan, who&s;e charms are decayed, may &s;till live upon the emolu|ments ari&s;ing from their fame. Let them but get their names recorded in a <HI>Race</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a poem &s;o called, in which Dr. J. is celebrated, among other things, for his <HI>mode&s;ty</HI>; and in like manner Paul V&mdash;t, who wears a little &s;mart bob, is de&s;cribed as overwhelmed by a wig more tremendous than Dal|mahoy's.</NOTE>, or a <HI>Meretriciad,</HI> and they may &s;till remain the favourites of purblind fops and &s;uperficial witlings.</NOTE>. Is it po&s;|&s;ible that &s;uch characters can have any real mode&s;ty, however nece&s;&s;ary they may find it to a&s;&s;ume its ap|pearance, artfully to impo&s;e on the world?</P>
<P>Not but that there are degrees, both in venality and impudence; &s;o that as a <HI>demi-rep</HI> may be <HI>compara|tively</HI> mode&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted, &s;o may an <HI>author.</HI> But to drop the compari&s;on; as there are many writers of a more liberal &s;tamp than to come under any deno|mination that will rank them in this parallel; writers, who, while they labour to in&s;truct and entertain the publick, labour equally to improve them&s;elves, and to render their future writings more valuable from the en|couragement
<PB N="50" REF="55">
given to the pre&s;ent, I mu&s;t own I can|not help thinking that &s;uch writers deba&s;e them&s;elves greatly, whenever they affect the fal&s;e mode&s;ty of un|experienced tyros, or de&s;igning ignorants. There is a &s;pecies of a&s;&s;urance in men of real knowledge, which may be &s;aid, without impropriety, to be con&s;i&s;tent with the mode&s;ty becoming their character, as they could not po&s;&s;ibly dive&s;t them&s;elves of it without evident hypocri&s;y and affectation. As to authors by profe&s;&s;ion, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily either di&s;play their a&s;&s;urance by in&s;i&s;ting on their own merit, or, in fact, confe&s;s them&s;elves bunglers, or impo&s;tors. And indeed why &s;hould they not? If an arti&s;t di&s;cover any mode of mechanical operation, or execute a piece of mechani&s;m, which is an improvement on what others have done be|fore him, or what nobody can execute but him&s;elf, who charges him with want of mode&s;ty in boldly a&s;&s;erting his own pre-eminence? Why then &s;hould a critick, a philo&s;opher, an hi&s;torian, or a poet, be thought too a&s;&s;uming in laying publick claim to that merit, which they actually po&s;&s;e&s;s? What &s;hould we think of an artizan or manufacturer, who &s;hould, in his adverti&s;e|ments and &s;hop-bills, <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> affect a diffidence of be|ing able to give his cu&s;tomers &s;atisfaction, having him|&s;elf a mean opinion of his own abilities? Should we not conclude, without he&s;itation, that he was either a knave or fool, or both? Yet how common is it to meet with authors, who have been many years <HI>in trade,</HI> ridiculou&s;ly affecting to think meanly of pro|ductions, which they neverthele&s;s importunately ob|trude on the publick, and make us pay for at as high
<PB N="51" REF="56">
a price as po&s;&s;ible? Yet many of the&s;e writers have the character of being mode&s;t men. In my opinion, however, I think it an in&s;tance of very great <HI>impudence,</HI> to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, for a man to offer me a com|modity at a great price, and to tell me at the &s;ame time he thinks it good for little. For what is this, in fact, but to tell me that he thinks me as great a fool as he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be a knave?</P>
<P>And yet, if a writer were to u&s;e the &s;ame arguments in the preface of his book, to &s;et off his works to ad|vantage, as an artizan or manufacturer is allowed to do his, in his &s;hop or warehou&s;e, he would of cour&s;e be condemned for want of <HI>mode&s;ty.</HI> Thus we &s;ee a very mode&s;t man may incur the obloquy of being an impudent author; and a very impudent author acquire the reputation of being a mode&s;t man.</P>
<P>The true &s;tate of this matter &s;eems to be this. Ig|norance and impudence as generally go together as in|nocence and mode&s;ty; but ignorance being often the companion, and &s;ometimes even the guardian, of in|nocence, it is no wonder that impudence &s;hould put on the appearance of mode&s;ty, in order to make us take mere ignorance for pure innocence.</P>
<P>Knowledge as naturally in&s;pires fortitude, as truth abominates hypocri&s;y. How ab&s;urd is it then to re|quire men of real abilities to affect that diffidence and ignorance to which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;trangers! At the &s;ame time, what can we think of tho&s;e writers, who, after being long hackneyed in the ways of men, and of their profe&s;&s;ion; who, after &s;etting them&s;elves up even at the head of that profe&s;&s;ion, pretend
<PB N="52" REF="57">
<HI>to tremble while they write,</HI> to <HI>bow down with reveren|tial awe to &s;uperior learning,</HI> to <HI>ki&s;s the rod of correc|tion,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. What, I &s;ay, can we think of &s;uch writers, but that, &s;en&s;ible of their own ignorance or im|becillity, they are cajoling the publick in a manner that de&s;erves the name of the highe&s;t <HI>impudence.</HI></P>
<P>Much more mode&s;t and manly is it for a wri|ter of years and experience, to a&s;&s;ert boldly and con|fidently what he hath good rea&s;on to think he knows <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And if he has not &s;uch rea&s;on, he &s;hould not trouble the pub|lick with his reveries.</NOTE>; and openly to defy every groundle&s;s imputation or in|&s;inuation of ignorance.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>On literary knowledge; with &s;ome remarks on <HI>IGNO|RANCE</HI> and <HI>INATTENTION.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT hath been frequently ob&s;erved, that the know|ledge of <HI>words</HI> is not the knowledge of <HI>things.</HI> Indeed the di&s;tinction between the <HI>&s;cholar</HI> and the man of <HI>&s;cience</HI> is now become general. It is neverthele&s;s cer|tain, that a man cannot be a con&s;iderable proficient in philology, particularly with regard to the modern languages, without having made &s;ome acqui&s;itions in &s;cience. It is not my intent, however, to expatiate here on this di&s;tinction, or to enhance the preference due to &s;cience above mere literature; my intention be|ing
<PB N="53" REF="58">
only to throw out a few &s;hort ob&s;ervations on li|terary knowledge in general.</P>
<P><Q>Be not vain of thy learning, child, &s;aid my grand|father to me when I was a boy; I have lived to for|get more than thou ha&s;t learned in thy whole life.</Q>
All this was very true; and yet I thought my&s;elf, ne|verthele&s;s, as good a &s;cholar as my grandfather: for when we were &s;ometimes both at a lo&s;s for a word or two of Greek, I found the only difference between us was, that I turned to the Lexicon for tho&s;e I never knew, and he for tho&s;e he could not remember: but my <HI>copia verborum</HI> was neverthele&s;s equal to his.</P>
<P>Now it would be a matter of &s;ome importance to determine, whether a man can with propriety be &s;aid to know what he cannot remember, even though he &s;hould have formerly had it perfectly impre&s;&s;ed in his memory?</P>
<P>I am afraid that we &s;hall go nigh to be laughed at by the vulgar, &s;hould we admit that a man may be &s;aid to know what he hath forgot, and can't tell us if we ask him. And yet, if he &s;hould recollect it half-an-hour hence, without any body's telling him in the mean time, &s;urely he mu&s;t have had &s;uch knowledge in him at the time of his being asked; &s;ince it does not appear that he had by any external means acquired it &s;ince.</P>
<P>This would afford a curious and &s;ubtle di&s;qu&s;ition; but, as I have not time to enter here into a profound inve&s;tigation of all the difficulties that &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves concerning it, I &s;hall only make an application of it to the
<PB N="54" REF="59">
learning of the two la&s;t editors of Shake&s;peare, and leave the reader to make it out as well as he can.</P>
<P>Mr. K. hath proved, in &s;everal parts of his Review of Dr. J's edition, that the &s;aid editor either did not then know, or had forgot the meaning of &s;everal words and pa&s;&s;ages, which it is plain the Doctor mu&s;t have formerly known, and probably would have recollected &s;ome odd time or other. I &s;hall in&s;tance only one or two. In one the very learned Doctors J. and W. both appear not to know the meaning of the word <HI>convene</HI>; Dr. W. objecting to Shake&s;peare's proper u&s;e of it, and Dr. J. adopting the &s;aid objection: and yet Mr. K. hath ju&s;tified Shake&s;peare, and convicted both the editors on the authority of Dr. J's own Dictionary.</P>
<P>Again, in regard to the u&s;e of the old phra&s;e, <HI>taken with the manner,</HI> both the&s;e learned editors flatly con|tradict them&s;elves; a&s;&s;erting in one volume that it is u&s;ed one way, and in another volume that it is u&s;ed differently.</P>
<P>I might mention many other in&s;tances of the like kind; but the&s;e will &s;uffice for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. What I want to know is, whether the&s;e are in&s;tances of <HI>ignorance</HI> or not?</P>
<P>Dr. J's friends will &s;ay, "O, no &mdash; he certainly knew better." Knew better? when? What, when he was told of the blunder, I &s;uppo&s;e? Surely that man may ju&s;tly be called <HI>ignorant,</HI> who&s;e knowledge, how great &s;oever, is out of the way when it is wanted!</P>
<P>Will it be &s;aid, the&s;e are not in&s;tances of <HI>ignorance</HI> but <HI>inattention?</HI> Pray what is <HI>inattention?</HI> Do you
<PB N="55" REF="60">
mean to &s;ay that the Doctor did not read the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, or that he read them when he was a&s;leep?</P>
<P>If he read them, and was wide awake, the&s;e mi&s;|takes could never have happened from <HI>inattention,</HI> but mu&s;t have been derived from <HI>forgetfulne&s;s</HI>; which, according to the arguments above adduced, mu&s;t be a &s;pecies at lea&s;t of <HI>ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>But the criticks will po&s;&s;ibly a&s;k me, what I mean by being <HI>wide awake,</HI> and by Dr. J's <HI>reading</HI> the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages? They will &s;ay, perhaps, that they know as well as I, that, when a commentator reads a pa&s;&s;age over, he mu&s;t comprehend it &s;ome way or other, right or wrong; and that no <HI>inattention,</HI> in that ca&s;e, can prevent the operation of his judgment re&s;pecting the words that lie before him; &s;o that, if he then mi&s;|takes, it mu&s;t be through <HI>ignorance.</HI>
<Q>But this was not the ca&s;e; (it may be &s;aid) Dr. J. could never dream that Dr. W. could be mi&s;taken &s;o gros&s;ly in matters &s;o clear and obvious, and therefore copied tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages implicitly from Dr. W's Comment: &s;o that it was nothing more than <HI>inattention.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Call you this method of proceeding <HI>inattention?</HI> It is &s;uch <HI>wilful negligence,</HI> that your friend Dr. J. will hardly be obliged to you for thus defending him from the charge of <HI>ignorance</HI>; for &s;urely, if we may not call it want of <HI>knowledge,</HI> we mu&s;t call it want of&mdash; &s;omething el&s;e, which a man of acknowledged <HI>virtue</HI> &s;hould not be without. What would a &s;imilar con|duct to this, be called in any of the common con|cerns of life? Happy is it, undoubtedly, for the pre|&s;ent race of authors, that they ALL, <HI>being pen&s;ioned,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="61">
can &s;ub&s;i&s;t and provide for their families, without be|ing obliged to publi&s;h their works by &s;ub&s;cription; for, after &s;uch flagrant in&s;tances of <HI>inattention,</HI> and that in a writer of the fir&s;t reputation for learning and <HI>virtue,</HI> what encouragement can any other, of le&s;s note, or le&s;s reputed virtue, ever hope to meet with?</P>
<P>The late Mr. Fielding, &s;peaking &s;omewhere of tho&s;e gentlemen, who had tied them&s;elves up, as it was then called, from &s;ub&s;cribing to works of genius and lite|rature, expre&s;&s;es his re&s;entment again&s;t them, by &s;ay|ing, it is a pity they were not tied up in good earne&s;t; but what do tho&s;e authors de&s;erve, who fir&s;t gave oc|ca&s;ion for people entering into &s;uch illiberal engage|ments?</P>
<P>And what doth Dr. J. in particular de&s;erve, for having obtruded on the world the wor&s;t Commentary of Shake&s;peare that ever appeared? and, at the &s;ame time, for having, by his procra&s;tination and neglect, &s;o effectually di&s;gu&s;ted the publick with editors and &s;ub&s;criptions, that it is pre&s;umed the able&s;t commenta|tor in the kingdom would find little encouragement for a &s;imilar undertaking? notwith&s;tanding, as the criticks ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, SHAKESPEARE <HI>&s;tands</HI> NOW <HI>in more need of a</HI> NEW EDITION <HI>than ever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT. ADDRESSED TO THE MONTHLY REVIEWERS.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot help thinking it a little fortunate, gentle|men, that your ob&s;ervations on Mr. K's Review ap|peared before the printer had quite fini&s;hed the fore|going &s;heets; as it affords me an opportunity of adding a word or two, by way of reply, to your ob&s;ervations on his <HI>extraordinary</HI> Review. It is indeed not without rea&s;on you give it that appellation; but, pray, do you mean thereby to in&s;inuate that nobody hath a right to make u&s;e of the word <HI>Review</HI> but your&s;elves? Have you an exclu&s;ive privilege to it, like that which is laid to the <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> or to the <HI>Gazette</HI>?</P>
<P>It is true, that you <HI>monthly</HI> gentlemen have the right of prior occupancy over your periodical rivals; who deal, like your&s;elves, in the whole&s;ale branch of criti|ci&s;m. But, becau&s;e you are whole&s;ale dealers, are you therefore to be monopolizers? Mu&s;t every Re|view extraordinary be &s;tigmatized as an extraordinary Review, becau&s;e it is not fabricated or vended in your work-&s;hop or warehou&s;e?</P>
<P>It was, doubtle&s;s, horridly provoking, to have your work taken out of your hands, and di&s;patched, while
<PB N="58" REF="63">
you were whetting your edge-tools. But why, there|fore, find fault with the tools of another artizan, who&s;e work you do not &s;eem to di&s;approve &s;o much, as his manner of executing it? Surely Dr. J. might as well &s;uffer by a Tomahawk as a cleaver! Is it not as well to be &s;calped by a Mohawk, as to be knocked on the head, or have one's throat cut, by a carca&s;e-butcher? And pray, how do you differ from the &s;anguinary a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of White-chapel and Cow-cro&s;s, except that yours are intellectual, and theirs are ani|mal victims? They only mangle the body. You mortify the very &s;oul; and mu&s;t expect to be morti|fied in turn. For let me tell you, in the fir&s;t place, that even your witty conceit of comparing Mr. K. to a Mohawk or a Cherokee, will never be thought your own, by tho&s;e who recollect the Cherokees and Iro|quois that Bi&s;hop W. is charged with having &s;et on the back of Dr. Lowth. You critical gentlemen &s;eem indeed to be all terribly mi&s;taken with regard to the place of Mr. K's nativity. The <HI>Critical</HI> Reviewers and Chroniclers declared him to be a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and you in&s;i&s;t upon his being a Mohawk or a Cherokee Indian. It is a pretty long po&s;t-&s;tage from the de&s;arts of Tar|tary to the wilds of America. We know, indeed, that you &s;peak metaphorically, and, tho' far-fetched, &s;o far it is excu&s;able; but let us &s;ee if the hyperbole is not to be found among your other tropes and figures. You &s;ay
<Q>the <HI>Reviewer</HI> (Mr. K.) &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e vi|olent a&s;&s;ailants, who&s;e aim is not merely to vanqui&s;h, but even to <HI>exterminate</HI> his antagoni&s;t.</Q>
It is well you put in that qualifying <HI>&s;eems.</HI> But you &s;ay po&s;itively,
<PB N="59" REF="64">
that he endeavours to expo&s;e his antagoni&s;t as a very <HI>pretender</HI> to all literature and &s;cience.</P>
<P>This, you &s;ay, is quite outrageous.&mdash;And &s;o it might be, were it &s;trictly true; but you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, Mr. K. does not <HI>po&s;itively deny</HI> that Dr. John&s;on is ma&s;ter of the languages and &s;ciences; he only &s;ays, it <HI>does not appear</HI> &s;o to <HI>him.</HI> Who knows but Mr. K. might here mode&s;tly intend to in&s;inuate his own inability to comprehend the amazing &s;tores and va&s;t profundity of Dr. John&s;on's &s;cience and eru|dition? Why then would you not give him credit for the appearance of being in &s;o mild and promi&s;ing a di&s;po&s;ition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And that the&s;e criticks might ju&s;tly have done it, had they been inclined to &s;hew Mr. K. fair play, will appear &s;ufficiently from the pa&s;&s;age hinted at, with the note he hath annexed. "I do not &s;ay," &s;ays Mr. K.
<Q>that Dr. John&s;on may not pro|bably be well &s;killed in <HI>&s;ome</HI> things; not that <HI>I know</HI> that he is well &s;killed in any <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I will except, indeed, the article of <HI>literary compo&s;ition</HI>; in which, &s;o far as the merit of a &s;peech, an e&s;&s;ay, a life, or a novel, goes, he is undoubtedly the be&s;t writer in Chri&s;tendom.</NOTE>; for, though I have read <HI>all</HI> his <HI>works,</HI> I declare he does not <HI>appear to me</HI> (at lea&s;t &s;o far as I my&s;elf am able to judge) to be <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> of any <HI>one &s;cience,</HI> or any <HI>one lan|guage.</HI> Not that I <HI>deny</HI> him to be ma&s;ter of the <HI>whole circle of &s;ciences,</HI> and of <HI>all languages ancient and modern.</HI></Q>
&mdash;Surely, Mr. Monthly Reviewer, it is you that are <HI>outrageous</HI>! for Mr. K. &s;peaks here with becoming mode&s;ty and diffidence.</NOTE>?

In reading the preceding &s;heets,
<PB N="60" REF="65">
you will have &s;een that, although the violation of Shake&s;peare was the fir&s;t fault for which the Doctor happens to be publickly arraigned, it was by no means the fir&s;t fact in which he had been caught, and for which he would, &s;ooner or later, have certainly been indicted, by his pre&s;ent pro&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>But I &s;ee how the matter &s;tands with you, periodical criticks. Your own credit re&s;ts on too tottering a ba&s;is for you to indulge your&s;elves &s;afely in any incli|nation you might have to cha&s;ti&s;e writers of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation.</HI> You are therefore reduced, in a manner, to the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;playing your dexterity in the manual exerci&s;e of the critical &s;courge, on objects ju&s;t &s;triving to go alone, without any body to &s;upport them. This behaviour, doubtle&s;s, redounds greatly to the honour of your prowe&s;s and mag|nanimity; and as the notice I here take of it, may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome little effect on your cen&s;orial dignity, if not on the intere&s;t of your proprietor, I &s;hall take the liberty of giving both him and you a word of advice, for the regulation of your future con|duct. I mu&s;t own indeed that the Monthly Review, from its regularity in coming to town for &s;o many years, full or empty, hath obtained the reputation of being one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;tage-coaches on the high-road of Parna&s;&s;us; but Mr. G&mdash;h, (that is, Mr. <HI>Gee-ho,</HI> the driver) will give me leave to tell him, that, if he continues to detain his pa&s;&s;engers &s;uch a confounded while at Turnham-green, clogging his wheels &s;o cur&s;edly with the coom of dullne&s;s, to make them run &s;mooth, &s;ome other <HI>Jehu,</HI> on the &s;ame road,

The very picture of the mock-cavalcade of the Grand Ma|&s;ons! Then you &s;ee the two fore-hor&s;es drag the whole team!

It was, indeed, a mi|racle to me, that we ever got in time to town, when I ob&s;erved that no two hor&s;es ever pulled together, and more than one of them hung an ar&s;e, and drawed back|wards all the way.</P>
<P>But to drop the allegory.</P>
<P>You &s;peak of Mr. K's having treated Dr. J. with extraordinary <HI>freedoms.</HI>&mdash;Pray, Sir, who is Dr. J. that Mr. K. may not treat him, at his own peril, with as much freedom as he plea&s;es? If S. J. be <HI>artium magi|&s;ter,</HI> W. K. is <HI>philo&s;ophiae doctor,</HI> and &s;o far upon a footing. If S. J. be L. L. D., W. K. is J. U. D. If Mr. K. al&s;o was not educated at the univer&s;ities that complimented him with his degrees, Dr. J. &s;tands in the &s;ame predicament with regard to tho&s;e learned &s;e|minaries that dignified him with his. There is, to be &s;ure, this difference between the two doctors, that the

latter never has thought it worth while, like the for|mer, to adverti&s;e &s;uch in&s;ignifant circum&s;tances in the magazines and news-papers, holding in very &s;light e&s;timation &s;uch literary endowments, as may be pur|cha&s;ed at a Scotch univer&s;ity for ten pounds; at al|mo&s;t any German one for twenty ducats; and may be had, as Dr. H. knows, from L&mdash;th, merely at the moving &s;olicitation of a printer.</P>
<P>Again, you ask, Sir, whether Mr. K. is not appre|hen&s;ive, on account of his &s;everity, of &s;haring the fate of Tom O&s;borne? That is, in plain terms, of Dr. J's <HI>knocking him down.</HI> This is, to be &s;ure, a very conci&s;e and <HI>liberal</HI> method of determining literary merit, and po&s;&s;ibly may have &s;ome effect on the Monthly Re|viewers. This intimidating intimation, indeed, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;erve to account for the tremendous influence of Dr. J's per&s;onal and literary authority in ge|neral. For who will he&s;itate to commend, or dare to contend again&s;t, a writer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch <HI>knock-me-down</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Foote's Minor.</NOTE> arguments? You will plea&s;e to take this along with you, however, that, although Mr. K. may not have &s;uch terrific talents, nor be quite &s;o much of a <HI>brute</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an ingenious copy of ver&s;es, lately publi&s;hed in the St. James's Chronicle, wherein the Dr. is proved, on the confe&s;&s;ion of his own friends, to be, indeed, the <HI>Prince of bea&s;ts</HI>; a conclu&s;ion at which neither Dr. J. nor his friends could rea&s;onably take of|fence, one of them having thought proper, in a copy of ver&s;es before printed in the &s;ame paper, very politely to compare Mr. K. and his friends to a parcel of <HI>moakies</HI>; and, at the &s;ame time, o liken the &s;urly grumbling of the Dr. him&s;elf to the contemptuous growling of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on.</HI> This ver&s;ifier, however, affords not the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> example, wherein the ear of pu&s;illanimity hath been deceived by the braying of an a&s;s in a lion's &s;kin. How far Dr. J. may be compared to &s;uch an animal &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, time will &s;hew, Mr. K. not having begun to &s;trip off that &s;kin, but with a determined re&s;olution to exhibit the real creature, &s;ooner or later, in <HI>puris naturalibus.</HI></NOTE> as many more celebrated writers, he may po&s;|&s;ibly
<PB N="63" REF="68">
be found, on trial, as much of a <HI>man,</HI> in every re&s;pect, as the be&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Could you imagine then, Mr. <HI>Monthly,</HI> that Mr. K. would not re&s;ent that partiality which you have evi|dently betrayed in your remarks on <HI>his</HI> Review. This partiality is the more evident from your very diffe|rent and favourable con&s;truction of the &s;tile and man|ner of a pamphlet recently publi&s;hed again&s;t one of the gentlemen attacked by Mr. K. I mean Dr. L&mdash;th's Letter to Dr. W&mdash;n; the acrimony, &s;everity, and &s;currility of which are, in every re&s;pect, much greater than is to be found in the &s;trictures of Mr. K. on Dr. J. And yet this is with you the <HI>elegant</HI> and unexceptionable production of a <HI>gentle</HI> and amiable wri|ter, di&s;playing equally the abilities of the &s;cholar and the gentleman. Nay, you your&s;elf, Mr. Critick, have quoted &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, wherein the language and allu&s;ions are as <HI>low</HI> as po&s;&s;ible, and, indeed, hardly grammatical. What do you think of this writer's ac|cu&s;ing a bi&s;hop of the church, in plain terms, with having been guilty
<Q>of <HI>&s;neering</HI> at the original Scrip|tures; with making u&s;e of far-fetched conceit and forced plea&s;antry, void of wit, of meaning, of common &s;en&s;e, and <HI>common decency</HI>: with u&s;ing low banter, illiberal burle&s;que upon the prophets, the apo&s;tles, and the holy Scriptures.</Q>

plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that &s;uch a charge as this, brought again&s;t &s;uch a character, is not only &s;currilous, but, if fal&s;e, is, to the la&s;t degree, ba&s;e and injurious. And, pray, how is the truth of &s;uch problematic accu&s;ations to be proved? Who is to judge whether the pa&s;&s;ages, hinted at in Dr. W's writings be &s;uch <HI>low banter</HI> and <HI>illiberal burle&s;que</HI> or not? Is Dr. L&mdash; him&s;elf to judge of this, or you, Mr. Monthly Reviewer? Give me leave to &s;ay, you will find no &s;uch <HI>equivocal</HI> accu&s;a|tions brought by Mr. K. again&s;t Dr. J. If he hath charged him with being <HI>ignorant</HI> and <HI>inattentive,</HI> he hath given repeated proofs of the truth of his a&s;&s;er|tion. If he hath called Dr. J. <HI>indolent, &s;elf-&s;ufficient,</HI> or <HI>arrogant,</HI> is he not notoriou&s;ly all the&s;e? If Mr. K. hath, at any time, &s;ugge&s;ted the Doctor's want of <HI>ap|prehen&s;ion</HI> or <HI>invention,</HI> he hath in like manner proved it. After all which, I would be glad to know where is the illiberality or &s;currility of Mr. K's laughing at him, and calling him <HI>dull</HI>; nay, even though he &s;hould in&s;inuate that he hath no more imagination than a leaden plummet, and &s;ay he was the <HI>dulle&s;t animal of all commentators.</HI> For, pray, where is the harm of all this, even whether it be true or fal&s;e? That the Doctor is a commentator, &s;uch a one as he is, nobody will deny: that he is an <HI>animal,</HI> and a very &s;trange one too, every body will own: and, as <HI>dullne&s;s,</HI> even in the highe&s;t or lowe&s;t degree, is by no means criminal, I can|not &s;ee how reflections of this kind can be, with any con|&s;i&s;tent pretence to impartiality, be deemed illiberal and &s;currilous by criticks, who have admitted the above in&s;tance, quoted from Dr. L. to be elegant, refined,
<PB N="65" REF="72">
or polite. It is true that Mr. K. hath &s;trongly in&s;i|nuated, that Dr. J. hath not done ju&s;tice either to his &s;ub&s;cribers, or to the proprietors, in his edition of Shake&s;peare: And hath not he proved it? Nay, doth not the event of its publication &s;ufficiently &s;hew that he had no need to have given him&s;elf the trouble to prove what all the world admit to be true? If, on this account, he hath treated Dr. J. &s;everely, the Doctor hath ju&s;t the &s;ame right of complaint as a pickpocket, who gets only hor&s;e whipped, or pumped, in&s;tead of a &s;everer puni&s;hment. Ought not the Doctor to do as he does, &s;hake his ears, &s;link quietly off, and think him&s;elf happy <HI>it is no wor&s;e</HI>?</P>
<P>It is true Mr. K. hath charged Dr. J. with an invi|dious de&s;ign of detracting from the moral and religious character of Shake&s;peare. But in what manner has he done this?&mdash;Not by a mere verbally-abu&s;ive declara|tion of the fact in general; but by a &s;pirited and fair allegation, &s;upported by particular te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>And yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, Mr. K. truly, is with you an <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o</HI> in critici&s;m, a very <HI>Mohawk,</HI> a <HI>Cherokee,</HI> and what not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Surely this in&s;tance of the <HI>Monthly</HI> Reviewer's partiality to|ward Mr. K. will &s;ufficiently obviate the fooli&s;h &s;u&s;picions of the Candid Reviewers and others, of his being <HI>him&s;elf</HI> connected with that work. What, becau&s;e a man may have been accidentally obliged to take up his lodgings in a &s;table, is he to be deemed an hor&s;e, or an o&s;tler, for ever after? Misfortune may bring a man acquainted, as Trinculo &s;ays, with &s;trange bed-fellows; but it is his own fault if he does not change his companions with his cir|cum&s;tances.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A word more, and I have done. You have been plea&s;ed to expre&s;s &s;ome reluctance at &s;preading what
<PB N="66" REF="73">
you term <HI>per&s;onalities.</HI> There are many gentlemen al&s;o, to who&s;e judgment Mr. K. is ready to pay the greate&s;t deference, who expre&s;s them&s;elves, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, in the &s;ame &s;train. Nay, even &s;ome of Dr. J's friends good-naturedly affect, like the <HI>Monthly</HI> Reviewers, to think Mr. K. hath forgot
<Q>the re&s;pect due to his own rank in the republick of letters,</Q>
by de&s;cending, as they call it, to <HI>&s;uch per|&s;onalities.</HI> But, if they &s;ay this of the author of the <HI>Review of Dr. J's Shake&s;peare,</HI> what will they &s;ay of the author of this <HI>Defence</HI> of it?&mdash;Doubtle&s;s, ten times wor&s;e; but I care not.&mdash;As to all tho&s;e, who are ju&s;tly reprehended in this pamphlet, they will of cour&s;e exclaim loudly again&s;t my having expo&s;ed the petty <HI>particulars</HI> of their pitiful and di&s;ingenuous conduct with regard to Mr. K. and his writings. They will naturally cry it down as <HI>low,</HI> as <HI>il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iberal,</HI> and &s;o forth. It is not for the intere&s;t of <HI>offenders</HI> that their actions &s;hould be too <HI>minutely</HI> &s;crutinized; they mu&s;t unani|mou&s;ly plead for the u&s;e of <HI>general</HI> reflections only, in order that the accu&s;ation may,
<Q>like a wild-goo&s;e, fly, unclaimed of any man;</Q>
but the ju&s;tice due to the individual <HI>per&s;on</HI> injured, claims a like peculiar re|taliation of <HI>per&s;onalities.</HI> It were a degradation, indeed, of any man's character to become a common thief-taker or informer; but it can be none for him to &s;eize or pro&s;ecute tho&s;e, who may have meanly picked his own pocket, or ba&s;ely attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his friend. It would redound, in like manner, little to the honour of a man of rank or fortune, to &s;toop &s;o low as to go to boxing with a Slack or a Broughton;

but, perhaps, the fir&s;t nobleman in the kingdom would not be di&s;plea&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s their athletic abili|ties: in which ca&s;e, I apprehend, the world would think it no impeachment of his dignity, if, highly provoked, he &s;hould for once wave his privilege, and cha&s;ti&s;e the offender, of what rank &s;o ever, at his own weapons. And thus, even &s;uppo&s;ing Mr. K's enthu|&s;ia&s;tic plea of <HI>ju&s;tifying the dead</HI> &s;hould, in the more prudential opinion of the <HI>living,</HI> be condemned as chimerical; he hath, at <HI>wor&s;t,</HI> only indulged his <HI>pa&s;|&s;ions</HI> at the expence of his <HI>politene&s;s,</HI> and waved his preten&s;ions as "the <HI>&s;cholar</HI> and the <HI>gentleman,</HI>" to <HI>ex|po&s;e</HI> his abilities as a MAN, <HI>gentle</HI> or <HI>&s;imple,</HI> as the rea|der may determine.</P>
<P>In the mean time, nothing could be more unbe|coming Mr. K. than, through meanne&s;s or affectation, to &s;ue for that determination in his favour, which the publick, without knowing it, have, in a great de|gree, already made. For, however <HI>unnece&s;&s;arily par|ticular</HI> I may be thought to have been in the foregoing &s;heets, the publick are yet to learn the principal mo|tives of that confidence, which Mr. K. &s;eems, on their &s;uffrage, to have a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reviewer of Dr. John&s;on's Shake&s;peare</HI> indeed, hath too long and too &s;ucce&s;sfully laboured in the lite|rary vineyard <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Like a</HI> MOLE, &s;ays the ingenious and &s;arca&s;tical author of the <HI>Traveller.</HI> This troglodite, however&punc; hath now made his appear|ance above-ground; and po&s;&s;ibly Mr. G.
