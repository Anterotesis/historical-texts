<P>POEMS UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.</P>
<P>By Mrs. <HI>LEAPOR</HI> of <HI>Brackley</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Poems was taken from the World at the time when &s;he fir&s;t began to meet with Encouragement to print them, and, in Compliance with her dying Re|que&s;t, they are now publi&s;hed for the Benefit of her Father, who is de&s;irous to make u&s;e of this Oppor|tunity of returning his humble Thanks to the Sub|&s;cribers for the Favour they have been plea&s;ed to &s;hew him.</P>
<P>The &s;hort Account which has been given of Mrs. <HI>Leapor,</HI> with the Propo&s;als for a Sub&s;cription, it is hop'd, will &s;ufficiently apologize for the Defects that &s;hall be found in this Collection. Had &s;he lived to cor|rect and fini&s;h the&s;e fir&s;t Productions of a young una&s;|&s;i&s;ted Genius, certainly they would have been greatly improved, tho', as they now appear in their native Simplicity, they cannot &s;urely but afford an agreeable Entertainment to the Reader, and &s;erve as a con|vincing Proof of the common Aphori&s;m, <HI>Poeta na&s;citur, non fit.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Leapor</HI> from a Child delighted in reading, and particularly Poetry, but had few Opportunities of procuring any Books of that kind. The Author
<PB REF="3">
&s;he mo&s;t admired was Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> whom &s;he chiefly endeavoured to imitate; how far &s;he &s;ucceeded in this, or any other of her Attempts, mu&s;t be left to the Judgment of the Publick. And indeed if the Poems will not recommend them&s;elves to the Reader, little Advantage is to be expected from any thing that can be &s;aid of them here; but, in Ju&s;tice to the Memory of the Author, as well as for the Satisfaction of all tho&s;e who have &s;o chearfully and generou&s;ly contri|buted to improve the be&s;t Legacy &s;he could bequeath to her Father, we beg leave to inform them, that her Conduct and Behaviour entirely corre&s;ponded with tho&s;e virtuous and pious Sentiments which are con|&s;picuous in her Poems. She was courteous and oblig|ing to all, chearful, good-natured, and contented in the Station of Life in which Providence had placed her. The generous and charitable Spirit that appeared in her was exerted upon all Occa&s;ions to the utmo&s;t of her Ability, and was &s;uch as would have been ornamental in a much higher Sphere, to which in all Probability, if it had plea&s;ed God to &s;pare her Life, her own Merit would have rai&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Some of her Papers, a little time before her Death, were communicated to &s;everal Per&s;ons of Rank and of di&s;tingui&s;hed Ta&s;te and Judgment, who were plea&s;ed to expre&s;s a great Satisfaction in the View they had of promoting a Sub&s;cription for their being printed, and by that means encouraging her to pro|ceed in a Science &s;o agreeable to her&s;elf, and enter|taining to them; but her Friends are now left to la|ment her Lo&s;s, and that &s;o great a Part of a &s;hort and valuable Life was &s;pent in Ob&s;curity.</P>
