<L>THE youth I &s;ing, who, to him&s;elf unknown,</L>
<L>Lo&s;t to the world and CALEDONIA's throne,</L>
<L>Sprung o'er his mountains to the arms of Fame,</L>
<L>And, wing'd by Fate, his &s;ire's avenger, came;</L>
<L>That knowledge learn'd, &s;o long deny'd by fate,</L>
<L>And found that blood, as merit, made him great.</L>

<L>The aged chieftain on the bier is laid,</L>

<L>The youthful warriors, as the cor&s;e they bear,</L>

<L>Mean time fierce SCANDINAVIA's ho&s;tile pow'r,</L>

<L>Prepar'd, at once, the city to invade,</L>

<L>His camp, for night, the royal SUENO forms,</L>

<L>And bend their little army to the fight.</L>

<L>Thus they con&s;ult. Brave ALPIN's martial gait,</L>
<L>Approach'd the portals of the dome of &s;tate;</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to offer to his king and lord,</L>

<L>Th' unu&s;ual &s;ight the gallant chief admires,</L>

<L>The antient Kings of CALEDONIA's land.</L>
<L>The marble lives, they breathe within the &s;tone,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The FERGUS's are &s;een above the gate;</L>
<L>This fir&s;t created, that re&s;tor'd the &s;tate.</L>
<L>In warlike pomp, the awful forms appear,</L>

<L>While to their &s;ide young ALEION &s;eems to ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And on her fathers turns her &s;miling eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And next appears GREGORIUS' awful name,</L>
<L>HIBERNIA's conqu'ror for a gen'rous fame.</L>
<L>Inca&s;s'd in arms, the royal Hero &s;tands,</L>

<LG>
<L>The youthful warrior thus reviews, with joy,</L>
<L>The godlike &s;eries of his ance&s;try.</L>
<L>The godlike forms the drooping HERO cheer,</L>
<L>And keen ambition half believes the &s;eer:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
Eager he &s;hoots into the &s;pacious gate;</L>
<L>His eye commands, without his followers wait.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No frowning &s;pear-man guards the awful door;</L>
<L>No borrow'd terror arms the hand of pow'r:</L>
<L>No cringing bands of &s;ycophants appear,</L>
<L>To &s;end fal&s;e echoes to the monarch's ear.</L>
<L>Merit's &s;o&s;t voice, oppre&s;&s;ion's mournful groan,</L>
<L>Advanc'd, un&s;tiffl'd, to th' attentive throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hero, ent'ring, took his &s;olemn &s;tand</L>
<L>Among the gallant warriors of the land.</L>
<L>His manly port, the &s;taring chiefs admire;</L>
<L>And half-heard whi&s;pers blow the &s;oldier's fire.</L>
<L>A while his form engag'd the monarch's eyes,</L>
<L>At length he rai&s;ed the mu&s;ic of his voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Whence is the youth? I &s;ee fierce DENMARK warms</L>
<L>Each gen'rous brea&s;t, and fires 'em into arms.</L>
<L>A face once known is in that youth expre&s;t,</L>
<L>And mends a dying image in my brea&s;t."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He &s;aid: And thus the Youth; "'mid&s;t rocks afar,</L>
<L>I heard of DENMARK, and of SUENO's war.</L>
<L>My country's &s;afety in my bo&s;om ro&s;e;</L>
<L>For CALEDONIA's &s;ons &s;hould meet her foes.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6">
We ought not meanly wait the &s;torm at home,</L>
<L>But ru&s;h afar, and break it 'ere it come.</L>
<L>Few are my foll'wers, but the&s;e few are true;</L>
<L>We come to &s;erve our country, fame, and you!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He &s;aid: The king retorts; "thy form, thy mind,</L>
<L>Declare the &s;cion of a gen'rous kind;</L>
<L>With SCOTIA's foes maintain the &s;tern debate,</L>
<L>And &s;pring from valour to the arms of &s;tate.</L>
<L>Whoe'er would rai&s;e his hou&s;e in ALBION, &s;hou'd</L>
<L>Lay the foundation in her en'mies' blood."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to the Chiefs: "Supporters of my throne,</L>
<L>Your &s;ires brought oft the Roman Eagles down.</L>
<L>Your&s;elves, my lords, have caus'd the haughty DANE,</L>
<L>To cur&s;e the land, he try'd &s;o oft in vain.</L>
<L>Norvegian firs oft brought them o'er the waves,</L>
<L>For ALBION's crown; but ALBION gave'em graves.</L>
<L>Be &s;till the &s;ame, exert your&s;elves like men,</L>
<L>And of th' invaders wa&s;h our rocks again.</L>
<L>Tho' few our numbers, the&s;e, in arms grown old,</L>
<L>In ALBION's and in INDULPH's cau&s;e are bold.</L>
<L>The brave man looks not, when the clarion &s;ounds,</L>
<L>To ho&s;tile numbers, but his country's wounds;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">
Bold to the la&s;t and dauntle&s;s he'll go on,</L>
<L>At once his country's &s;oldier and her &s;on."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The monarch thus his royal mind expre&s;t;</L>
<L>The patriot kindling in each gen'rous brea&s;t.</L>
<L>Each chieftain's mind with plea&s;ure goes before,</L>
<L>Already mingling with the battle's roar.</L>
<L>In thought each Hero &s;weeps the bloody plain,</L>
<L>And deals, in fancy, death upon the DANE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DUMBAR aro&s;e, the brave remains of wars,</L>
<L>Silver'd with years, o'er-run with hone&s;t &s;cars;</L>
<L>Great in the &s;enate, in the field renown'd;</L>
<L>The &s;enior &s;tood: attention hung arround.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He thus: "Fierce DENMARK all the North commands,</L>
<L>And belches numbers on our neighb'ring lands,</L>
<L>England's &s;ubdu'd, the Saxons are o'ercome,</L>
<L>And meanly own a Dani&s;h lord at home.</L>
<L>Scarce now a bla&s;t from SCANDINAVIA roars,</L>
<L>But wafts a ho&s;tile &s;quadron to our &s;hores.</L>
<L>One fleet de&s;troy'd, another crowns the waves,</L>
<L>The &s;ons &s;eem anxious for their father's graves:</L>
<L>Thus war returns in an eternal round,</L>
<L>Battles on baules pre&s;s, and wound on wound.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8">
Our numbers thinn'd, our godlike warriors dead,</L>
<L>Pale CALEDONIA hangs her &s;ickly head;</L>
<L>We mu&s;t be wi&s;e, be frugal of our &s;tore,</L>
<L>Add art to arms, and caution to our pow'r.</L>
<L>Beneath the &s;able mantle of the night,</L>
<L>Ru&s;h on the foe, and, latent, urge the fight.</L>
<L>Conduct with few may foil this mighty pow'r,</L>
<L>And DENMARK &s;hun th' inho&s;pitable &s;hore."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The &s;enior &s;poke: a gen'ral voice approves;</L>
<L>To arm his kindred-bands each chief removes.</L>
<L>Night from the ea&s;t the drou&s;y world invades,</L>
<L>And clothes the warriors in her du&s;ky &s;hades:</L>
<L>The va&s;&s;al-throng advance, a manly cloud,</L>
<L>And with their &s;able ranks the chieftains &s;hroud.</L>
<L>Each chief, now here, now there, in armour &s;hines,</L>
<L>Waves thro' the ranks, and draws the lengthen'd lines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, on a night when rattling tempe&s;ts war,</L>
<L>Thro' broken clouds appears a blazing &s;tar;</L>
<L>Now veils its head, now ru&s;hes on the &s;ight,</L>
<L>And &s;hoots a livid horror thro' the night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The full form'd columns, in the midnight hour,</L>
<L>Begin their &s;ilent journey tow'rds the &s;hore:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9">
Thro' ev'ry rank the chiefs inciting roam,</L>
<L>And rouzing whi&s;pers hi&s;s along the gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A ri&s;ing hill, who&s;e night-invelop'd brow</L>
<L>Hung o'er th' incamped &s;quadrons of the foe,</L>
<L>Shoots to the deep its ooze immantled arm,</L>
<L>And, &s;teadfa&s;t, &s;truggles with the raging &s;torm;</L>
<L>Here ends the moving ho&s;t its winding road:</L>
<L>And here conden&s;es, like a &s;able cloud,</L>
<L>Which long was gath'ring-on the mountain's brow,</L>
<L>Then broke in thunder on the vales below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again the chiefs, in midnight council met,</L>
<L>Before the king maintain the calm debate:</L>
<L>This waits the equal conte&s;t of the day,</L>
<L>That ru&s;hes, headlong, to the nightly fray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length young ALPIN &s;tood, and thus begun,</L>
<L>"Great king, &s;upporter of our antient throne!</L>
<L>Brought up in mountains, and from councils far,</L>
<L>I am a novice in the art of war;</L>
<L>Yet hear this thought.&mdash;Within the womb of night,</L>
<L>Confirm the troops, and arm the youth for fight;</L>
<L>While &s;oftly-treading to yon' camp I go,</L>
<L>And mark the di&s;po&s;ition of the foe:</L>
<L>Or, wakeful, arm they for the di&s;mal fight,</L>
<L>Or, wrapt within the lethargy of night,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10">

<L>Expect your &s;py to point out latent &s;torms;</L>
<L>But, they in arms, too long delay'd my &s;peed,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>A gen'ral voice th' exploring thought approves,</L>
<L>And ev'ry wi&s;h with youthful ALPIN moves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hero &s;lides along the gloom of night,</L>
<L>The camp-fires &s;end afar their gleaming light;</L>
<L>Athwart his &s;ide the tru&s;ty &s;abre flies,</L>
<L>The various plaid hangs, plaited, down his thighs:</L>
<L>The cre&s;ted helm waves, awful, on his head;</L>
<L>His manly trunk the mail and cor&s;let &s;hade:</L>

<L>The feeding cour&s;er to the &s;take is bound,</L>
<L>The pro&s;trate hor&s;eman &s;tretch'd along the ground:</L>
<L>Extended here the brawny footman lay,</L>
<L>And, do&s;ing, wore the lazy night away.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11">
The watchman there, by &s;leep's &s;oft hand o'er|power'd,</L>
<L>Starts at the bla&s;t, and half un&s;heaths his &s;word.</L>
<L>Th' exploring youth, thro' night's involving cloud,</L>
<L>Circling the foe, their di&s;po&s;ition view'd.</L>
<L>At length the Hero's du&s;ky journey ends,</L>
<L>Where HACO fea&s;ted with his Dani&s;h friends;</L>
<L>HACO, by more than SUENO's blood, was great;</L>
<L>The promis'd monarch of the triple &s;tate.</L>
<L>The Scandinavian camp the youth &s;ecur'd</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two oaks, from earth by headlong tempe&s;ts torn,</L>
<L>Supply the fire, and in the circle burn;</L>
<L>Around with &s;ocial talk the fea&s;t they &s;hare,</L>
<L>And drown in bowls the CALEDONIAN war:</L>
<L>O'erpower'd, at length, by &s;lumber's &s;ilken hand,</L>
<L>They pre&s;s the beach, and cow'r upon the &s;trand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A gallant deed the Mountain-youth de&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>And nurs'd a growing action in his mind.</L>
<L>Awful the chief advanc'd: his armour bright</L>
<L>Reflects the fire and &s;hines along the night.</L>
<L>Hov'ring he &s;tood above the &s;leeping-band,</L>
<L>And &s;hone, an awful column, o'er the &s;trand.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<L>Thus, o&s;ten to the midnight traveller,</L>
<L>The &s;talking figures of the dead appear:</L>
<L>Silent the &s;pectre tow'rs before the &s;ight,</L>

<L>At length the giant phantom hovers o'er</L>
<L>Some grave unhallow'd, &s;tain'd with murder'd gore.</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus ALPIN &s;tood: He exiles to the dead</L>
<L>Six-warrior-youths; the trembling remnant fled;</L>
<L>Young HACO &s;tarts, un&s;heaths his &s;hining &s;word,</L>
<L>And views his friends in iron-chains &s;ecur'd.</L>
<L>He ru&s;hes, headlong, on the daring foe;</L>
<L>The godlike ALPIN renders blow for blow.</L>
<L>Their clatt'ring &s;words on either armour fell;</L>
<L>Fire fla&s;hes round, as &s;teel contends with &s;teel.</L>
<L>Young ALPIN's &s;word on HACO's helmet broke,</L>
<L>And to the ground the &s;tagg'ring warrior took.</L>
<L>Leaning on his broad &s;hield the hero bends;</L>
<L>ALPIN, aloft in air, his &s;word &s;u&s;pends:</L>
<L>His arm up-rais'd, he downward bends his brow,</L>
<L>But &s;corn'd to take advantage of the-foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young HACO from his hand the weapon threw,</L>
<L>And from his flaming brea&s;t the&s;e accents drew.</L>
<L>"Brave&s;t of men! who cou'd thro' night come on,</L>
