<HEAD>JOHN the SHOPKEEPER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS told you in a former lay,</L>
<L>How on a luckle&s;s evil day</L>
<L>The Trader John, a land&s;man brave,</L>
<L>Left the dry ground to try the wave.</L>
<L>But here the poet mu&s;t rehear&s;e,</L>
<L>In &s;oft, and &s;weet, and tender ver&s;e,</L>
<L>How gentle Johnny had a wife,</L>
<L>The joy and &s;olace of his life,</L>
<L>The &s;harer of his griefs and cares,</L>
<L>Privy to all his great affairs;</L>
<L>One who when ty'd in wedlock's noo&s;e</L>
<L>Had prov'd a helpmate &s;it for u&s;e;</L>
<L>One whom he married&mdash;not for whim&mdash;</L>
<L>But who could keep his hou&s;e in trim;</L>
<L>No high-&s;lown mi&s;s, or Belle, or Beauty,</L>
<L>A &s;imple Girl that knew her duty;</L>
<L>Had well obey'd her Father, Mother,</L>
<L>And coun&s;ell'd well her younger Brother;</L>
<L>Healthy when young, and rather &s;tout:</L>
<L>Moral?&mdash;nay more, &s;he was devout:</L>
<L>And now a Chri&s;tian quite at heart,</L>
<L>She carefully fulfils her part,</L>
<L>Well &s;kill'd alike her hou&s;e to guide,</L>
<L>And &s;erve the &s;hop at Johnny's &s;ide.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">
See now &s;he works to help the trade,</L>
<L>And now in&s;tructs her under maid;</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>But 'tis her chief and &s;pecial care,</L>
<L>Her Hu&s;band's daily toil to &s;pare;</L>
<L>When &s;ick, or weary and oppre&s;t,</L>
<L>To ea&s;e the troubles of his brea&s;t,</L>
<L>To &s;oothe his &s;orrows, calm his fears,</L>
<L>And help him thro' this vale of tears;</L>
<L>Remind him where his trea&s;ure lies,</L>
<L>And point to realms above the &s;kies,</L>
<L>Where, when this &s;hifting &s;cene is o'er,</L>
<L>The faithful meet to part no more.</L>
<L>Now twenty &s;ummers or above</L>
<L>Have glided by and prov'd her love:</L>
<L>And though they may have marr'd her face,</L>
<L>Have ripen'd many a Chri&s;tian Grace;</L>
<L>Hence it may now be fairly gue&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Her late&s;t days &s;hall be her be&s;t.</L>
<L>John knows her worth, and now-a-days,</L>
<L>He grows quite eager in her prai&s;e;</L>
<L>For ev'ry calling friend is told,</L>
<L>"My Wife is worth her weight in Gold."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To this ble&s;t couple there was born,</L>
<L>One Daughter cheerful as the morn;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">
A Maiden &s;he of &s;potle&s;s fame,</L>
<L>E'en in her mirth quite clear from blame.</L>
<L>Train'd in Religion's "narrow way,"</L>
<L>Her mind untainted by a Play,</L>
<L>She hates your giddy glitt'ring &s;cenes,</L>
<L>Tho' long &s;ince enter'd on her teens;</L>
<L>Sees all things in a proper light,</L>
<L>And vice quite puts her in a fright;</L>
<L>Prompt and obedient from a Child,</L>
<L>Obliging, humble, meek and mild;</L>
<L>Still, before &s;trangers, as a mou&s;e;</L>
<L>Yet va&s;tly u&s;eful in the Hou&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>Toils for the &s;hop, tho' &s;eldom &s;een;</L>
<L>&mdash;Ah!&mdash;there &s;he &s;its behind the &s;creen;</L>
<L>There, like &s;ome flower both &s;weet and gay,</L>
<L>She &s;huns as yet the blaze of day;</L>
<L>(Well does her prai&s;e adorn my tale)</L>
<L>A new-blown Lily of the Vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now &s;hould perchance &s;ome fool draw near,</L>
<L>And get to whi&s;per in her ear,</L>
<L>Of Plays, and Balls, and Fairs, and Races,</L>
<L>Fine mid-night Routs, and public Places,</L>
<L>And wonder how &s;he can endure,</L>
<L>A life &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o pure&mdash;</L>
<L>Extol her form, her piercing Eyes,</L>
<L>And tell a hundred flatt'ring lies;</L>
<L>&mdash;While the &s;weet prai&s;e he thinks &s;he &s;ips,</L>
<L>The tortur'd Maiden bites her lips;</L>
<L>Thinks his fine flatt'ry mere pretence,</L>
<L>And longs to tell him to talk &s;en&s;e;</L>
<L>Yet dreads to take the dunce in hand,</L>
<L>Le&s;t he &s;hould &s;till not under&s;tand.</L>
<L>But &s;hould he let his <HI>vice</HI> peep out,</L>
<L>The meek-ey'd Girl can then turn &s;tout;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5">
For once ('tis &s;aid) in terms direct,</L>
<L>A &s;pruce and &s;aucy &s;park &s;he check'd;</L>
<L>(She grew &s;o &s;olemn in her &s;peeches</L>
<L>The Bucks give out that "Nancy preaches")</L>
<L>And once put on the &s;weete&s;t air,</L>
<L>And begg'd a Carman not to &s;wear.</L>
<L>Thus while &s;he &s;pends her peaceful days,</L>
<L>Her parents' care &s;he well repays;</L>
<L>Honors her father, loves her mother,</L>
<L>She'll prove methinks ju&s;t &s;uch another;</L>
<L>And tho' &s;carce &s;een, except at church,</L>
<L>The men won't leave her in the lurch;</L>
<L>Some hone&s;t Chri&s;tian man &s;he'll &s;trike,</L>
<L>No Buck or Blood&mdash;for like loves like.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next in my &s;ong, of equal fame,</L>
<L>Comes a good hone&s;t antient dame;</L>
<L>John's mother&mdash;with no fault but one&mdash;</L>
<L>I mean&mdash;&s;he doated on her &s;on;</L>
<L>For when her own dear &s;pou&s;e was gone,</L>
<L>Her whole affections fell to John;</L>
<L>'Twas then, the widow's age &s;o great,</L>
<L>Her pro&s;pects &s;mall, her income &s;trait,</L>
<L>That Johnny weighed the matter well,</L>
<L>And took her to his home to dwell:</L>
<L>No co&s;t or trouble did he grudge,</L>
<L>For John had rightly learn'd to judge</L>
<L>That people, once of little fame,</L>
<L>But now of high and mighty name,</L>
<L>Oft owe the glory of their &s;tation,</L>
<L>To the mere help of Education.</L>
<L>Quoth he&mdash;"Were all men good and true,</L>
<L>"Their wealth, methinks, might half be due,</L>
<L>"To &s;ome good dame who now is found</L>
<L>"Quite thru&s;t upon the mere back ground:</L>

"Be&s;ides (he added half in tears)</L>
<L>"A child is always in arrears,</L>
<L>"In debt, alas! o'er head and ears,"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh with what joy, what thanks and prai&s;e</L>
<L>To the Great Length'ner of her days,</L>
<L>What feelings not to be outdone,</L>
<L>Tow'rds her dear John, her only &s;on,</L>
<L>Did the good parent take her &s;tation,</L>
<L>And kindly own the obligation!</L>
<L>And now his tenderne&s;s &s;he pays,</L>
<L>By helping in a thou&s;and ways.</L>
<L>Deck'd in her be&s;t &s;he comes in view,</L>
<L>And &s;erves the &s;hop from twelve to two;</L>
<L>Knows not each price perhaps quite pat,</L>
<L>Yet keeps the croud in civil chat,</L>
<L>Till John him&s;elf comes up to &s;ell</L>
<L>A yard of lute&s;tring, or an ell:</L>
<L>Next to the Cook her aid &s;he brings,</L>
<L>And does a hundred little things:</L>
<L>Loves her own &s;elf to lay the cloth,</L>

<L>Yet let me add, if things go wrong,</L>
<L>Madam &s;oon &s;hews her fears are &s;trong;</L>

<L>"Of what <HI>&s;he's</HI> &s;een and what <HI>&s;he's</HI> known;"</L>
<L>And in a way that va&s;tly wins,</L>

<L>Adds wi&s;dom e'en to Johnny's wife;</L>
