<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly&mdash;we'll have the wedding to-night. The young couple are &s;o much in love, they will be glad to di&s;pen&s;e with ceremony&mdash; it really looks as if Heaven had a hand in this match, for if young Felix had not died &s;o com|modiou&s;ly at Salamanca, we could never have been brothers-in-law.</P>

<P>As well as any hog&s;head in my cellar&mdash;I have kept a tavern three years at Salamanca, and he was my con&s;tant cu&s;tomer. I knew his &s;i&s;ter too, a brave mettled dam&s;el, that made no more of clapping on a pair of breeches, and &s;traddling a hor&s;e-back, than if &s;he had never been laced in &s;tays, or encumber'd with a petticoat.</P>

<P>Well, now &s;he may give a more free &s;cope to her frolics, for &s;he has no brother left to re&s;train her. We &s;ent for you, Borachio, to provide the wedding-dinner. Let things be as they &s;hould be.</P>

<P>Never trouble your head about it.

<P>This is &s;trange news. It mu&s;t be a very &s;udden death&mdash;perhaps it was only his gho&s;t that hired me, but I never &s;aw any thing &s;o like a living creature; he gave me a rap over the &s;houlders ju&s;t now, that I thought felt very na|tural.

<P>Really, young gentleman, nothing could be more a-propos than your arrival. A day's delay longer had lo&s;t you your mi&s;tre&s;s, and a good portion into the bargain. Have you &s;een any thing of Ferdinand, your rival, &s;ince?</P>

<P>I don't doubt it, I don't doubt it. I was the &s;ame my&s;elf when I was young; but what with a little gout and rheumati&s;m in my arms, and better than three&s;core years over my head, my appetite for the duello is &s;omewhat abated; &s;o do you hear, Felix, when your hand's in, if you would frighten Sancho a little for me it would not be ami&s;s. He left me when I &s;aw him la&s;t with a menace, and ever &s;ince I think I have him before my eyes flouri&s;hing a long toledo.</P>

<P>You are perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then do you con&s;ider how difficult it is to bring an old man up to my years? As to your young people they die, and are born every hour; few of them come to maturity, and no great mat|ter&mdash;but a hale, healthy, &s;tout old man as I am, is invaluable. Your young, puny, tender &s;hrubs are not mi&s;s'd from a plantation; but if the old tree falls, think what a length of time it requires to replace him: my eyes run over when I reflect upon it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I take the liberty of offering my poor congratulations on this joyful occa&s;ion? Will you believe it, Sir, I had a &s;ort of an inkling, a divining, that &s;omething of this kind would happen; for I dreamt all la&s;t night of cats and dogs and a &s;pread eagle.</P>

<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your dreams, I hope, go by contraries; and you &s;hall be a witne&s;s of our harmony, for I intend to keep you in my &s;ervice.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be bold to &s;ay, Sir, you never took a wi&s;er re&s;olution. Mercy on me, Sir, you don't know half what I can do to &s;erve you. I

was Major Domo to the fir&s;t Grandee of Arragon, he was called Don Guzman Podero&s;o, y Chilos, y Figureroz, y Palidos, y Fu&s;cados, y Dumpos: he was a great man, Sir, and had a great many names.</P>

<P>He lo&s;t his only daughter, a mo&s;t beautiful young Lady, who broke her heart for the death of her lover, and a favourite &s;quirrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very &s;u&s;ceptible Lady, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Sir, very &s;urreptible. A cer|tain Duke, a particular friend of my ma&s;ter's, came to condole with him (for poor Grandee, he was quite uncomfortable) and &s;pying me wiping my eyes in an outward room, with a Barcelona handkerchief, as he was taking leave of my ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, Don Dumpos, I am &s;orry for your mis|fortune; but be of good heart, pray be comforted. If you had lo&s;t your wife as well as your daughter, I &s;hould hardly know how to pity you, while you po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a trea&s;ure in a &s;ervant as the incomparable Lazarillo.

<P><STAGE>(To Clara.)</STAGE>
Madam, your ingenuity has had already &s;uch ample revenge for the rude language I u&s;ed to you, that I hardly know how to offer an apology for the effects of my mi&s;taken anger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, if any apology were nece&s;|&s;ary, I ought to make it, for I was certainly the offender; but all unkindne&s;s mu&s;t give way here|after to e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</P>
