<P>WHAT will the world &s;ay of me, but that I was a very prudent man?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The World! the world will applaud you, e&s;pe|cially when they know what &s;ort of lovers they are, and that the &s;ole motive of their affection is the Ladies for|tune. No poor girl &s;ure was ever plagued with &s;uch a brood as I am.&mdash;The fir&s;t upon my li&s;t is a high minded North-briti&s;h Knight, who &s;ets up for a wit, a man of learning and &s;entiment: He bears him&s;elf fair while you are pre&s;ent, but abu&s;es the whole world when their backs are turn'd, and withal, has &s;o high a notion of the dignity of his family, that he would, no doubt, think he laid me under a great obligation, in honouring me with his hand.&mdash;The &s;econd is a downright ideot, a fluttering, frivolous thing, well known in mo&s;t public places by the name of Beau Mordecai, an Engli&s;h Jew, &mdash;The next in Cupid's train, is your Nephew, who&s;e Iri&s;h voice and military a&s;pect, make me fancy that he was not only born in a &s;iege, but that Belona alone cou'd be his nur&s;e, Mars his preceptor, and the camp the a|cadamy where he receiv'd the fir&s;t rudiments of his education.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Theo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Charlotte, you &s;hould not be &s;o &s;evere upon my Nephew; what can you expect from a mere rough hewn &s;oldier, who mu&s;t needs go from his

friends a volunteer, and has lived the&s;e &s;everal years within the circuit of a camp; &s;o that I don't believe he has &s;ix ideas di&s;tinct from his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Vera weel, that's right, that's right.&mdash; I mun ken that your lady&s;hip has been entertain'd vera weel by my friend Mordecai, before I broke in upon you: he's a guid ane at a tale, when the &s;tocks is at one end and the lottery at the ither; ha! ha! ha!

<P>Left him! ye maun ken that I hae brought him wi' me; for I am like the monarchs of auld. I never travel without my fuil, he is as good as a Comedy or a Farce: but he has made a Jargon, which he &s;tiles a&s;on|net, upon his bewitching Charlotte; as he calls you ma|dam, he is now altering it, and ye mann expect &s;ic an epi&s;tle as has na' been pen'd &s;in' the days of Don Qixote.

You &s;ee Sir Archy, I was for carrying on my approaches like a &s;oldier, A-la-militaire, as we &s;ay abroad.&mdash;
<Q>You are &s;en&s;ible my family is as old as any in the three kingdoms, and older too; I &s;hall therefore come to the point at once.</Q>
&mdash;You &s;ee I have given him a little rub by way of a hint about our family, becau&s;e Sir Theodore is a bit of a relation by the mother's-&s;ide, only which is a little up&s;tart family, that came in with one &s;trong bow t' other day, not above &s;ix or &s;even hundred years ago: Now my father's family are all related to the O'Stricke&s;&s;es, the O'Cannakans, the O'Calloghans, and I my&s;elf am an O'Bralaghan, which is the olde&s;t of them all.</P>
