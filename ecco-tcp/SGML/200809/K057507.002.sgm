<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Harriot's Artifices produce the de&s;ired Effect on the un&s;u&s;pecting Sophia.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they arrived at Mrs. Law&s;on's, Sophia, who lit|tle expected &s;uch a vi&s;it, had wandered, as u&s;ual, in the wood, accompanied with Dolly: Mrs. Law&s;on immediately &s;ent Fanny in &s;earch of her: and Harriot, expre&s;|&s;ing an impatience to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter, went along with her.</P>
<P>They found Sophia &s;itting under an oak, with Mrs. Gibbons on one
<PB N="2" REF="11">
&s;ide of her, and Dolly on the other; for the old gentlewoman was pre|vailed upon by Sophia to endure the company of the innocent girl, who had never offended her; and Dolly, in&s;tructed by her lovely friend, made good u&s;e of the&s;e opportunities to recover her favour.</P>
<P>William leaned on a branch clo&s;e by Sophia, to whom he addre&s;&s;ed his di&s;cour&s;e, while his eyes often &s;tole tender glances at his beloved Dolly. Harriot, when &s;he approached, cried out affectedly,
<Q>Upon my word, &s;i&s;ter, you have a brilliant a&s;&s;em|bly here; I did not expect to find you in &s;uch good company.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter, ran ha&s;tily to meet her, and embrac|ing her kindly, enquired with a &s;weet anxiety for her mother, and whether &s;he al&s;o had been &s;o good as to vi&s;it her. Harriot &s;carce an&s;wered her que&s;|tion; her attention was all fixed upon
<PB N="3" REF="12">
William: &s;o hand&s;ome a youth &s;eemed worthy to feel the influence of her charms; and all the artillery of her eyes was in&s;tantly levelled again&s;t him. Having returned his re&s;pectful bow with an affected cour|te&s;y, and the fa&s;hionable to&s;s of the head, &s;he deigned to take &s;ome little notice of Mrs. Gibbons, and honour|ed Dolly with a carele&s;s glance, who&s;e amiable figure, however, at|tracted a &s;econd look; and after ex|amining her with an inqui&s;itive eye, &s;he turned away with a little expre&s;|&s;ion of &s;corn in her countenance, and again attacked William, practi&s;ing a thou&s;and airs to &s;trike him; all which he beheld with the utmo&s;t indifference.</P>
<P>Sophia, being impatient to &s;ee her mother, took leave of Mrs. Gibbons; but Harriot, who had a new conque&s;t in view, was unwilling to go &s;o &s;oon, profe&s;&s;ing her&s;elf inchanted with the
<PB N="4" REF="13">
place, and declaring &s;he would turn &s;hepherde&s;s.</P>
<P>Sophia told her, &s;miling, that &s;he was &s;ure that &s;ort of life would not plea&s;e her.</P>
<P>"Oh! how can you think &s;o," cried Harriot,
<Q>is not the dre&s;s ex|ce&s;&s;ively becoming? then love in the&s;e woods is &s;o tender and &s;in|cere! I will engage there is not a nymph in this hamlet who&s;e frown would not drive her lover to de&s;pair: own the truth now,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, turning with a lively air to William,
<Q>are you not violently in love?</Q></P>
<P>The youth bowed, blu&s;hed, and &s;ighed; and not daring to look at his mi&s;tre&s;s, he &s;uffered his eyes, full as they were of tender expre&s;&s;ion, to di|rect their glances towards Sophia. "I am proud to own, madam," &s;aid he to Harriot,
<Q>that I have a heart capable of the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">"And mighty con&s;tant too! no doubt," interrupted Harriot with a malignant &s;neer; for &s;he had ob&s;erv|ed the &s;igh and the look, and was ready to bur&s;t with vexation and di&s;|appointment, to find her conque&s;t ob&s;tructed already by her &s;i&s;ter, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed; and being now as im|patient as &s;he was before unwilling to be gone, "Come, Sophy," &s;aid &s;he, taking her under the arm,
<Q>my mamma will take it ill that you make no more ha&s;te to &s;ee her, for we &s;hall return to town immediately.</Q></P>
<P>"Sure you will &s;tay one night," &s;aid Sophia.</P>
<P>"Oh not for the world!" ex|claimed Harriot affectedly;
<Q>How can you imagine I would &s;tay &s;o long in an odious village, to be ru&s;ticated into aukwardne&s;s,</Q>
pur|&s;ued &s;he with a &s;piteful laugh,
<PB N="6" REF="15">
<Q>and a&s;hamed to &s;hew my face in any a&s;&s;embly in town afterwards.</Q>
Saying this, &s;he courte&s;ied di&s;dainfully to Mrs. Gibbons and her nephew, and tripped away, pulling her &s;i&s;ter away with her.</P>
<P>Dolly joined the two ladies, but walked by the &s;ide of Sophia, not aiming at any familiarity with the in|&s;olent and affected Harriot; and as they pur&s;ued their way home, &s;he had the mortification to hear her lover ridiculed and de&s;pi&s;ed by the di&s;ap|pointed coquet, who &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he mortified her &s;i&s;ter by the contempt &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for a man who had &s;o little ta&s;te as to like her.</P>
<P>Sophia, as well in compa&s;&s;ion to poor Dolly, who &s;uffered greatly up|on this occa&s;ion, as in ju&s;tice to the amiable youth, defended him warm|ly, which drew &s;ome coar&s;e raillery upon her from Harriot.</P>
<P>When they came near to Mr.
<PB N="7" REF="16">
Law&s;on's hou&s;e, the &s;ight of Sir Charles's chariot threw her into a fit of trembling; Harriot perceived it, and, willing to undeceive her, if &s;he hoped to find the young baro|net there,
<Q>I am charged with Sir Charles's compliments to you,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he;
<Q>he in&s;i&s;ted upon our u&s;ing his chariot for this little excur&s;ion; my mamma and I would fain have per&s;uaded him to accompany us, but he pleaded an engagement, and would not come.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly now looked with great con|cern upon her fair friend, who, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing a &s;igh, a&s;ked if Sir Charles was quite recovered.</P>
<P><Q>I do not know that he has been ill,</Q>
replied Harriot.
<Q>Indeed when he came from Bath, the fatigue he had endured with his &s;ick uncle, whom he had &s;at up with &s;everal nights before he
<PB N="8" REF="17">
died, made him look a little pale and thin; but he is now ex|tremely well, and more gay than ever: and it is well he is &s;o,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>for we have &s;o much of his company, that if he was was not entertaining, we &s;hould find him very trouble&s;ome.</Q></P>
<P>All this was daggers to the heart of poor Sophia: tho&s;e plea&s;ing ideas which &s;he had indulged upon read|ing her mother's letter, that repre|&s;ented Sir Charles as having &s;uffer|ed in his health, from his endea|vours to vanqui&s;h his pa&s;&s;ion for her, now vani&s;hed, and left in their room a &s;ad conviction that &s;he was become wholly indifferent to him.</P>
<P>She might indeed, knowing her &s;i&s;ter's malice, have attributed what &s;he &s;aid to artifice; but her manner of accounting for the alteration in Sir Charles's looks, which her fond fancy had dwelt upon &s;o much, was
<PB N="9" REF="18">
&s;o natural, and &s;o full of probabi|lity, that &s;he could expect no arti|fice there.</P>
<P>Every thing Harriot &s;aid was con|firmed by facts, which left no room for doubt: his a&s;&s;iduity to Harriot, his neglect of her, appeared but too plain. Did he not lend his chariot for a vi&s;it in which he would not &s;hare? Did he not &s;end his com|pliments in a manner that &s;hewed his heart was &s;o much at ea&s;e, that he felt not even any re&s;entment for her leaving him? Could there be &s;tronger proofs of indifference than the&s;e?</P>
<P>Such were her thoughts, and her heart was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed by this &s;ud|den and unexpected &s;hock, that it was with difficulty &s;he re&s;trained her tears. Dolly, who looked at her with tender anxiety, and &s;aw her colour come and go, and her charming eyes bent on the ground, as if &s;he
<PB N="10" REF="19">
feared to look up, le&s;t they &s;hould betray her angui&s;h, ca&s;t many an angry glance at her envious &s;i&s;ter, and wi&s;hed her a thou&s;and miles off.</P>
<P>Sophia having a little recovered her&s;elf, ha&s;tened towards her mo|ther, who, with a face of ignorant wonder, was following Mrs. Law|&s;on about her little farm, a&s;king a thou&s;and que&s;tions, without heed|ing the an&s;wers &s;he received. So|phia approaching, paid her duty to her with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect, which Mrs. Darnley return|ed with &s;lightly ki&s;&s;ing her cheek, telling her that &s;he thought her complexion was greatly improved, and appealed to Harriot for the truth of her ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Harriot an&s;wered,
<Q>That indeed &s;he could not flatter her &s;i&s;ter &s;o much as to &s;ay &s;he thought &s;o; for if there was any alteration, it was rather for the wor&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="20">Sophia, without attending to this difference of opinion, with regard to her complexion, was only &s;olli|citous to know if her mother had been well; and while &s;he was mak|ing &s;ome tender enquiries concern|ing her health, Mrs. Darnley, who never con&s;ulted either time or place, &s;uddenly interrupted her, to draw her a&s;ide from the company, and a&s;ked her abruptly,
<Q>Whether &s;he was not &s;urpri&s;ed at Sir Charles's indifference?</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, &s;till &s;marting with the pangs her &s;i&s;ter's di&s;cour&s;e had given her, replied, in a tone of re&s;ent|ment,
<Q>That nothing now could &s;urpri&s;e her with regard to Sir Charles.</Q></P>
<P>"Why, to &s;ay the truth, So|phia," replied Mrs. Darnley,
<Q>I believe he has quite forgot you; but there was a time when you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight have been happy.&mdash;Oh,
<PB N="12" REF="21">
girl, girl,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, kindling with anger as &s;he &s;poke,
<Q>you were always ob&s;tinate and con|ceited; what a fooli&s;h part have you played with all your wit! but I am to blame to trouble my&s;elf about you.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia now ea&s;ed her loaded heart by a &s;hower of tears.
<Q>It is to little purpo&s;e now,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Darnley,
<Q>to repent of your imprudent behaviour; you were too wi&s;e to take a parent's advice, when it might have been u&s;eful: when a man of rank and fortune makes his addre&s;&s;es to a woman who is inferior to him in both, he expects a thou&s;and little com|placencies and attentions from her, which, without wounding her honour, may convince him that it is not to his riches &s;he &s;a|crifices her&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>"Ah, madam," cried Sophia,
<PB N="13" REF="22">
<Q>that is a &s;nare which, has been fatal to many young women in my circum&s;tances. Who &s;ees not the advantages this gives a man who&s;e aim is to &s;educe? I am per&s;uaded the&s;e pernicious max|ims are not yours, but his, for who&s;e ungenerous purpo&s;e they are &s;o well calculated.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia gue&s;&s;ed truly; the young baronet had often had di&s;cour&s;es of this &s;ort with Mrs. Darnley, who neverthele&s;s took it ill that her daughter &s;hould offer her &s;uch an affront as to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he did not under&s;tand maxims as well as Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain than that we are never made &s;o ridicu|lous by the qualities we have, as by tho&s;e we affect to have. Mrs. Darn|ley, with all her ignorance, a&s;pired to be thought witty: &s;he therefore vindicated her claim to what So|phia
<PB N="14" REF="23">
had called maxims; no matter whether they were pernicious or not. The word maxim &s;ounded learnedly in her ears: &s;he told her daughter, with great a&s;perity, that &s;he was &s;o conceited and vain of her own wit, that &s;he would allow no one el&s;e to have any. Sophia found it difficult enough to appea&s;e her, but &s;he &s;uc|ceeded at length, and they joined the re&s;t of the company.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="15" REF="24">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Sophia is agreeably &s;urprized.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Law&s;on ea&s;ily prevailed upon her gue&s;ts to &s;tay that night and the following day, which, being Sunday, Harriot could not re|&s;i&s;t the temptation of di&s;playing her charms and her fine cloaths in a country church, which was &s;o new a triumph, that the thoughts of it kept her waking almo&s;t the whole night.</P>
<P>The ridiculous airs &s;he a&s;&s;umed to draw the admiration of the &s;imple villagers, who never &s;aw any thing &s;o fine and &s;o gay before, and who &s;tared at her with &s;tupid &s;urprize, made Sophia often blu&s;h for her: but her affected glances were chiefly directed to the beautiful youth, who&s;e in&s;en&s;ibility had &s;o greatly
<PB N="16" REF="25">
mortified her pride: &s;he &s;aw his eyes con&s;tantly turned towards the pew where &s;he &s;at; but &s;he &s;aw plainly that it was not her charms that drew them thither. She had no &s;u&s;picion that Dolly was the ob|ject of his affection, and &s;en&s;ible, to her great grief, of her &s;i&s;ter's power to charm, &s;he no longer doubted that this envied conque&s;t was hers.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed, &s;he appeared &s;o much out of humour, and &s;o im|patient to return to town, that Mrs. Darnley, over whom her power was ab&s;olute, complied with her importunity, and &s;et out with her for London, as &s;oon as they returned from church; notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours of the good cu|rate and his wife to detain them to dinner.</P>
<P>Sophia was now left alone to her own melancholy reflections; this
<PB N="17" REF="26">
vi&s;it from her mother and &s;i&s;ter had produced a &s;ad rever&s;e in her &s;i|tuation: hitherto hope had not quite for&s;aken her: the idea of being &s;till beloved by Sir Charles le&s;&s;en|ed all her griefs, and &s;upported her amid&s;t the doubt and anxiety which his my&s;terious conduct had involved her in: his indifference, &s;o appa|rent in her &s;i&s;ter's account of him, gave her pangs unfelt before: and never till now did &s;he think her&s;elf unhappy; for, unperceived by her|&s;elf, &s;he had encouraged a &s;ecret hope that the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had in|&s;pired him with, would not be ea|&s;ily &s;ubdued; and that perhaps all which &s;he had thought exceptiona|ble in his conduct, proceeded not from a &s;ettled de&s;ign to the preju|dice of her honour, but from that irre&s;olution and &s;lowne&s;s with which a man, too &s;en&s;ible of his &s;uperio|rity in birth and fortune, proceeds
<PB N="18" REF="27">
in an affair of marriage, where he has no ob&s;tacles to fear, and where every thing depends upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>She now perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of bani&s;hing Sir Charles from her heart; but at the &s;ame time, &s;he perceived all the difficulty of the ta&s;k. Though a&s;hamed of her tears, &s;he wept, and pa&s;&s;ionately exclaim|ed again&s;t her own weakne&s;s, which had kept her in a delu&s;ion &s;o fatal to her peace. She continued the whole day in her chamber, wholly ab&s;orbed in melancholy thoughts.</P>
<P>Dolly, who knew enough of her &s;ituation to gue&s;s the cau&s;e of this new affliction, was grieved to find her&s;elf excluded as well as the re&s;t of the family; and although &s;he ardently wi&s;hed to con&s;ole her, yet &s;he dur&s;t not intrude uncalled upon her retirement. While &s;he waited impatiently for her appearance, a vi&s;itor arrived, who &s;he knew
<PB N="19" REF="28">
would be welcome to her charming friend. As &s;oon as &s;he perceived him, &s;he flew with eager ha&s;te to inform Sophia, and, tapping at her door, told her in a joyful voice, that Mr. Herbert was ju&s;t alighted.</P>
<P>Sophia, &s;urpri&s;ed at the news, in&s;tantly opened her chamber-door, and &s;miling tenderly upon the charming girl, to whom &s;he excu&s;|ed her&s;elf for her long ab&s;ence, ha&s;tened to receive the good old man, who, after &s;ome affectionate enquiries concerning her health, rallied her upon the melancholy that appeared in her countenance.</P>
<P>Sophia blu&s;hed and fixed her eyes on the ground, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at his talking to her in that manner; and when with a ba&s;hful air, &s;he looked up again, and &s;aw a more than u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s in his eyes, her confu&s;ion encrea&s;ed, and for a few moments &s;he
<PB N="20" REF="29">
could not help feeling &s;ome re|&s;entment again&s;t her benefactor, for thus diverting him&s;elf with her unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert who&s;e thoughts were wholly employed on the plea&s;ing news he brought, did not perceive how much his beha|viour embarra&s;&s;ed her: to prevent his renewing a &s;ubject &s;o di&s;a|greeable, &s;he talked of the vi&s;it her mother and &s;i&s;ter made her.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert a&s;ked her,
<Q>If they had mentioned Sir Charles, and what &s;he thought of him now?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I think of him as I ought to do,</Q>
replied Sophia, with &s;ome warmth, "I de&s;pi&s;e him."</P>
<P>"Be not too ra&s;h, my dear child," &s;aid Mr. Herbert;
<Q>if your &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e malice I well know, has &s;ugge&s;ted any
<PB N="21" REF="30">
thing to Sir Charles's di&s;advan|tage, be a&s;&s;ured &s;he deceives you; for I am convinced he not only loves you, but loves you with honour.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, who from the fir&s;t words Mr. Herbert uttered, had been in great agitation, as expecting &s;omething extraordinary, was &s;o overwhelmed with &s;urprize at what &s;he heard, that her &s;peech and colour for&s;aking her, &s;he remain|ed pale, &s;ilent, and motionle&s;s in her chair.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, perceiving how powerfully this news operated on her &s;pirits, began to be appre|hen&s;ive of the con&s;equences, and was ri&s;ing ha&s;tily to give her &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when Sophia, rou&s;ed to recollection by this mo|tion of her venerable friend, and a&s;hamed of the extreme &s;en&s;i|bility &s;he had di&s;covered, apolo|gi&s;ed

for it with a charming mode&s;ty, that greatly affected the good old man, who, if he had known in what melancholy thoughts &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the day, would have told her with more cau|tion, a circum&s;tance that rai&s;ed her at once from de&s;pair to hope, and produced &s;o great a change in her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As we are never &s;o ready to fear a di&s;appointment as when we are neare&s;t the completion of our wi&s;hes, Sophia, with a &s;weet apprehen&s;ivene&s;s, which yet &s;he laboured to conceal, hinted her doubts of the baronet's &s;in|cerity; Mr. Herbert an&s;wering explicitly to the&s;e half expre&s;&s;ed doubts, told her, that he was fully per&s;uaded Sir Charles would act like a man of honour.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Mr. Herbert acquaints Sophia with the Re&s;ult of the Interview be|tween Sir Charles and him.</HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA, trembling a little at the &s;ight of Sir Charles's hand|writing, took the billet, and found it contained a me&s;&s;age from him to Mr. Herbert, reque&s;ting in very earne&s;t terms, the favour of an in|terview, and an offer to wait upon him at any hour he &s;hould ap|point.</P>
<P>"You may be &s;ure," &s;aid Mr. Herbert, receiving back the billet which Sophia gave him without &s;peaking a word,
<Q>that I did not &s;uffer Sir Charles to come to me; hearing from the me&s;&s;enger that his ma&s;ter was at home waiting for my an&s;wer, I attended him
<PB N="25" REF="34">
immediately. I perceived a little embarra&s;&s;ment in his countenance upon my fir&s;t entrance, but that &s;oon wore off: he welcomed me with great politene&s;s, and after thanking me for the ho|nour I did him, in preventing his vi&s;it, he entered immediate|ly upon the affair which had occa&s;ioned his &s;ending to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have, Sir, &s;aid he, &s;hewn &s;o truly a paternal affection for the young lady to whom I have paid my addre&s;&s;es, and are &s;o much e&s;teemed and reverenced by her, that I think I may without any impropriety, ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf to you upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"Here he pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed a "little perplexed.</P>
<P><Q>To be &s;ure, added he, I ought to have done this before; my conduct mu&s;t have appeared ca|pricious
<PB N="26" REF="35">
both to her and you, and indeed it was capricious,&mdash; but&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Here he pau&s;ed again, and fixed his eyes on the ground. His frankne&s;s,</Q>
pur&s;ued Mr. Herbert,
<Q>plea&s;ed me greatly, and di&s;po&s;ed me to give him a fa|vourable attention.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I cannot blame Mi&s;s Sophia, re&s;umed he, for acting as &s;he has done; my heart did homage to her virtue at the time that I &s;uf|fered mo&s;t from the contemptu|ous behaviour it &s;ugge&s;ted to her. Fain would I hope, added he &s;ighing, that the prejudices &s;he has conceived again&s;t me have not entirely bani&s;hed me from her remembrance; the de|licacy of my pa&s;&s;ion would be but ill &s;atisfied by calling &s;o de|&s;erving a woman my own, unle&s;s I could likewi&s;e boa&s;t a prefer|ence
<PB N="27" REF="36">
in her heart that left me no room to doubt my fortune had any &s;hare in determining her in my favour.</Q></P>
<P>"I know not," pur&s;ued Mr. Her|bert,
<Q>whether Sir Charles expect|ed any an&s;wer to this declara|tion; it is certain he looked on me with a kind of anxious timi|dity, and &s;topped a moment; I continued &s;ilent, and he pro|ceeded in this manner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know Mi&s;s Sophia has an under&s;tanding too &s;olid, and a mind too noble to &s;uffer any con|&s;iderations of rank and fortune to determine her &s;olely in an affair upon which the happine&s;s of her life depends: &s;he would not &s;ure|ly give her hand where her heart did not acknowledge a prefer|ence. 'Tis thus I an&s;wer all tho&s;e doubts which my &s;ituation, and perhaps an over&s;trained de|licacy
<PB N="28" REF="37">
&s;ugge&s;t: I am impatient to convince her of the purity of my pa&s;&s;ion; and con&s;idering you as her friend, her guardian, and one who is in the place of a fa|ther to her, I will take no &s;teps in this affair but &s;uch as have the &s;anction of your approbation; I will not even pre&s;ume to vi&s;it her without your permi&s;&s;ion: be you my advocate with her, tell her I lay my&s;elf and fortune at her feet, and will receive her from your hand as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that heaven can be&s;tow on me.</Q></P>
<P>"Now, my child,," pur&s;ued Mr. Herbert, looking on Sophia with a &s;mile,
<Q>how would you have had me an&s;wer to this di&s;cour&s;e? was it nece&s;&s;ary, think you, to play off a few female artifices here, and keep Sir Charles in doubt and anxious &s;u&s;pence, or did the
<PB N="29" REF="38">
apparent openne&s;s and candor of his procedure de&s;erve an equal degree of frankne&s;s on my part?</Q></P>
<P>"It is not to be doubted," &s;aid Sophia blu&s;hing,
<Q>but that on this occa&s;ion, as on every other, you acted with the utmo&s;t prudence.</Q></P>
<P>"I find," re&s;umed Mr. Herbert, <Q>that you are re&s;olved beforehand, to approve of whatever I &s;aid: well then, I told Sir Charles, that his pre&s;ent declaration en|tirely &s;atisfied me; that being fully convinced of his &s;incerity, I looked upon his offer as high|ly honourable and advantageous to you; and that I was very &s;ure you would have all the &s;en&s;e you ought to have of &s;o generous an affection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He then begged me to &s;et out immediately for this place, and prepare you to receive a vi&s;it from him. This reque&s;t I could
<PB N="30" REF="39">
not po&s;&s;ibly comply with, having bu&s;ine&s;s in town, which would nece&s;&s;arily detain me for &s;ome hours; but I promi&s;ed him to go as &s;oon as that was di&s;patched, which probably might be in the afternoon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He mode&s;tly a&s;ked my leave to accompany me; but this I de|clined, as fearing his &s;udden ap|pearance, without your being previou&s;ly acquainted with what had pa&s;t, might occa&s;ion &s;ome perplexity and unea&s;ine&s;s to you; &s;o it was agreed that he &s;hould come to-morrow.</Q></P>
<P>"To-morrow," replied Sophia, with an emotion &s;he was not able to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Yes, my child," replied the good old man,
<Q>have you any ob|jections to this?</Q></P>
<P>"I know not," replied Sophia, with downca&s;t eyes and a faultering
<PB N="31" REF="40">
accent,
<Q>what I ought to do; I have been &s;o u&s;ed to con&s;ider Sir Charles's profe&s;&s;ions in an unfa|vourable point of view; my heart has been &s;o accu&s;tomed to &s;u&s;|pect him&mdash;to guard it&s;elf again&s;t delu&s;ive hopes&mdash;perhaps I ought not to admit his vi&s;it &s;o ea&s;ily; &mdash;perhaps I ought to re&s;ent his former behaviour. I own I am greatly perplexed, but I will be determined wholly by your ad|vice.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert &s;aw her delicate &s;cruples, and, to favour her mode&s;|ty, an&s;wered, with the authority of a guardian,
<Q>When Sir Charles vi&s;its you next, Mi&s;s Sophia, he comes to offer you his hand; he has a&s;ked my con&s;ent as your guardian and your friend; and I, pre&s;uming on my influence over you in both the&s;e characters, have given it freely; and how
<PB N="32" REF="41">
indeed, having your intere&s;t and happine&s;s &s;incerely at heart, could I do otherwi&s;e? but if you think his former behaviour, in which however there were only &s;u&s;pi|cions again&s;t him, de&s;erves to be re&s;ented, at a time when tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions are ab&s;olutely de&s;troy|ed, you mu&s;t go through with your heroi&s;m, and &s;ee him no more; for as the poet &s;ays,
<Q>"He comes too near who comes to be denied.</Q>
&s;o he has offended too much who needs a pardon.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, who felt all the force of this, rea&s;oning, an&s;wered only by a blu&s;hing &s;ilence. Mr. Herbert then told her, that Sir Charles had de|clared to him that he would make the &s;ame &s;ettlements on her as had been &s;tipulated for his mother; for he added, with equal delicacy and
<PB N="33" REF="42">
tenderne&s;s,
<Q>Mi&s;s Sophia, in vir|tue, wit, good-&s;en&s;e, and every female excellence, brings me an immen&s;e portion.</Q></P>
<P>"Sir Charles," pur&s;ued Mr. Her|bert &s;miling,
<Q>by a &s;trange contra|diction, which is, I &s;uppo&s;e, al|ways found in lovers, though he was impatient to have me with you, yet could not help detain|ing me to have the plea&s;ure of talking of you: he painted to me very naturally, the unea&s;ine&s;s he had &s;uffered from your &s;uppo&s;ed contempt of him: he told me, that he was at one time deter|mined to travel, in order to efface you from his remembrance; but, (&s;aid he, ri&s;ing and unlock|ing a cabinet, from which he took out a paper and put into my hands,) you &s;hall judge whether amid&s;t all my re&s;entment I did not &s;till love Mi&s;s Sophia; that
<PB N="34" REF="43">
is my will, which I ordered to be drawn up previous to my in|tended journey.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He then, to &s;pare me the trouble of reading it all through, pointed to the place where you was mentioned, and I found he had bequeathed you an e&s;tate of four hundred pounds a-year for life, and five thou&s;and pounds to be di&s;po&s;ed of as you plea&s;|ed.</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t circum&s;tance touched Sophia &s;o much that tears filled her eyes; &s;he &s;ighed, and turned her head a&s;ide to conceal her emo|tion, while Mr. Herbert, without &s;eeming to ob&s;erve it, continued to repeat to her &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by Sir Charles, which &s;hewed the greatne&s;s of his affection, and his veneration for her virtues.</P>
<P>"We parted at length," pur|&s;ued Mr. Herbert,
<Q>extremely
<PB N="35" REF="44">
well &s;atisfied with each other, and to-morrow, or next day, at farthe&s;t, you may expect to &s;ee Sir Charles here; for he told me, that if he received no ill news from me, he would conclude I had prepared him a favourable reception; and, pre&s;uming on this hope, he would immediate|ly &s;et his lawyer to work to prepare the writings, that no|thing might be left undone which could convince you of the &s;incerity of his affections; therefore, my dear child, &s;et your heart at re&s;t; and &s;ince providence has thought fit to reward your piety and virtue, receive with humble gratitude that fortune to which you are rai&s;ed, and which puts it &s;o largely in your power to do good. I will now leave you,</Q>
&s;aid the good old man ri&s;ing,
<Q>to your own
<PB N="36" REF="45">
reflections; I have &s;carce &s;poke a word yet to our kind friends here, for I was &s;o impatient to &s;ee you, that I left them very abruptly.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXI.</HI> Sophia is threatened with a new Di&s;|appointment.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert had no &s;ooner left the room, than Sophia, in an ardent ejaculation, thanked heaven for thus relieving her from her di&s;tre&s;s: but it was long ere the tumult in her mind rai&s;ed by &s;uch unhoped for happy news &s;ub&s;ided, and gave place to that calm recol|lection which &s;upplied a thou&s;and plea&s;ing ideas, and filled her with the &s;ofte&s;t emotions of gratitude, tenderne&s;s, and joy.</P>
<P>She was now freed from tho&s;e tormenting doubts, which made her con&s;ider her tenderne&s;s for Sir Charles as a crime, and occa&s;ioned &s;o many, painful &s;truggles in her mind. What joy to reflect that
<PB N="38" REF="47">
the man &s;he loved was worthy of her affection! how plea&s;ing was the pro&s;pect that opened to her view; to be ble&s;t with the power of &s;hewing her gratitude to her friends, her piety to her mother; to repay her &s;i&s;ter's unkindne&s;s with acts of genero&s;ity; and indulge the benevolence of her heart in relieving every di&s;tre&s;s which fell within her power to relieve!</P>
<P>The&s;e were the advantages which &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf in the change of her fortune, and for the&s;e her grateful heart lifted it&s;elf up every moment in thanks and prai&s;e to that providence that be&s;towed them on her.</P>
<P>While Sophia was thus ab&s;orbed in thought, Dolly opened the door, and running up to her, eagerly cried,
<Q>Tell me true, my dear mi&s;s, has not Mr. Herbert brought you &s;ome good news?
<PB N="39" REF="48">
I am &s;ure he has; I never &s;aw him &s;o joyful in my life: and you look glad too,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, peering in her face with a &s;weet earne&s;tne&s;s.
<Q>May I not a&s;k you, Mi&s;s Darnley, what this good news is?</Q></P>
<P>"You may, my dear," &s;aid So|phia &s;miling,
<Q>but not now; you &s;hall know all &s;oon. At pre|&s;ent I would rather talk of your affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed I am greatly obliged to you, mi&s;s,</Q>
&s;aid Dolly,
<Q>for what you have done for me. Mrs. Gibbons &s;eems almo&s;t as kind to me as ever &s;he was, and you have talked &s;o &s;en&s;ibly to my mo|ther, that &s;he repents of her be|haviour to Mrs. Gibbons: and &s;he likes Mr. William &s;o well, that I am &s;ure &s;he would be glad to be reconciled to her.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="49"><Q>That is what I have been la|bouring at all this time,</Q>
re&s;um|ed Sophia.
<Q>If Mrs. Law&s;on can be per&s;uaded to make &s;ome conce&s;|&s;ions to the fanta&s;tick old gentle|woman, all may go well yet: it &s;hall be my care to bring them together; and if my endeavours to produce a reconciliation fail, perhaps I may be able to engage a more powerful mediator in your intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia had Sir Charles in her thoughts, who &s;he doubted not would readily undertake the cau&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lovers, and po&s;&s;ibly add &s;omething to her Dolly's porti|on, to le&s;&s;en the inequality there was between them in that point. She &s;poke with &s;uch a chearful confidence, that Dolly, full of hope and joy, thanked her with artle&s;s tran&s;ports of gratitude that moved her even to tears.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="50">The next day, though in expec|tation of &s;eeing Sir Charles, her heart laboured with a thou&s;and emotions; yet kindly attentive to the affairs of her friend, &s;he re|&s;olved to make Mrs. Gibbons a vi&s;it, to prepare the way for the hoped for interview between her and Mrs. Law&s;on. As &s;oon as &s;he had di&s;engaged her&s;elf from Mr. Her|bert, &s;he &s;et out alone for Mrs. Gibbons's hou&s;e; but &s;carcely had &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t field when &s;he &s;aw William, who who was as u&s;ual, &s;auntering about Mr. Law&s;on's grounds, in hopes of &s;eeing his mi&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Sophia beckoned to him, and he eagerly flew to meet her; for, next to Dolly, he thought her the mo&s;t charming woman in the world; and he adored her for the goodne&s;s with which &s;he intere&s;ted her&s;elf in his and his Dolly's happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51">When he drew near, Sophia told him &s;he was going to vi&s;it his aunt; the youth re&s;pectfully expre&s;&s;ed his concern that his aunt could not have that honour; &s;he was gone, he &s;aid, to vi&s;it a relation who lived a few miles up the country.</P>
<P>Sophia then told him the de&s;ign upon which &s;he was going, and the favourable di&s;po&s;ition Mrs. Law&s;on was in. "I am per&s;uaded," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>all might be made up, if we could but bring them toge|ther. Mrs. Law&s;on only wants opportunity to repair her fault; but how &s;hall we contrive to give her this opportunity? what expe|dient can we find out to overcome your aunt's ob&s;tinacy, and prevail upon her to enter Mrs. Law&s;on's door again?</Q></P>
<P>"I know one, madam," &s;aid the youth,
<Q>which I think would do.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="52">Sophia concluding from the ti|midity of his look, that &s;he was concerned in this expedient, pre&s;t him to &s;peak freely, a&s;&s;uring him &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t to the utmo&s;t of her power.</P>
<P>"My aunt, madam," &s;aid he,
<Q>is as you know a great ob&s;erver of forms: &s;he would not for the world fall under the cen&s;ure of having failed in any part of cere|mony or good breeding; now, madam, if you would be plea&s;ed to make a point of her return|ing your vi&s;it, and permit me to tell her that you are offended with her neglect, and that you in&s;i&s;t upon this proof of her po|litene&s;s, I am per&s;uaded &s;he will come.</Q></P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Sophia, &s;miling,
<Q>if you are of opinion this will do, you have my con&s;ent to &s;ay whatever you think will affect her
<PB N="44" REF="53">
mo&s;t; make me as angry and as ceremonious as you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing &s;hall be wanting on my part to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of this affair,</Q>
added &s;he, with a graver look and accent;
<Q>for I believe you have a &s;incere affec|tion for my young friend, and I &s;hall not be at re&s;t till I &s;ee you both happy.</Q></P>
<P>The youth, in who&s;e brea&s;t the &s;weet benevolence of her looks and words excited the &s;tronge&s;t tran|&s;ports of gratitude, not able to find words to expre&s;s his &s;en&s;e of her goodne&s;s, &s;uddenly threw him&s;elf at her feet, and ki&s;&s;ed her hand with a mixture of tenderne&s;s and awe.</P>
<P>Sophia, &s;miling at this &s;ally, &s;tep|ped back a little; upon which he ro&s;e up, and, with a graceful con|fu&s;ion, paid her his thanks: &s;he again repeated her promi&s;e of &s;erv|ing him, and took leave: he bow|ed
<PB N="45" REF="54">
low, following her for &s;ome time with his eyes, and &s;ent a thou&s;and kind wi&s;hes after her.</P>
<P>Sophia, at her return, acquaint|ed Dolly with what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her lover and her, and filled her with plea&s;ing hopes of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his &s;cheme: but now the day wore away, &s;he was in conti|nual expectation of &s;eeing Sir Charles; her heart throbbed with anxiety; every noi&s;e &s;he heard, &s;ounded like the trampling of hor&s;es, and then an univer&s;al trembling would &s;eize her. She dreaded, yet wi&s;hed for his ar|rival; and at every di&s;appointment &s;he &s;ighed, and felt her heart &s;ink with tender de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>Such were her agitations, till the evening being far advanced, &s;he gave up all hope of his coming that night. Mr. Herbert had a&s;&s;igned a very plea&s;ing rea&s;on for his vi&s;it being deferred till the next day;
<PB N="46" REF="55">
and, her mind growing more com|po&s;ed, &s;he went in &s;earch of the good old man, who, Dolly told her, was gone to walk in the meadows behind the hou&s;e; for &s;he had kept her&s;elf out of his &s;ight as much as po&s;&s;ible, unwilling that he &s;hould ob&s;erve her emotions. She &s;aw him at a di&s;tance, walking with a &s;low pace, and &s;he perceived he ob&s;erved her; but to her great &s;urprize, &s;he &s;aw him cro&s;s into another field, and take a quite contrary way, on purpo&s;e to avoid her.</P>
<P>Struck with this little accident, &s;he &s;tood &s;till, and pau&s;ed a few mo|ments: &s;he felt her&s;elf &s;trangely alarmed, yet wondered why &s;he &s;hould be &s;o, and took her way back again to the hou&s;e with &s;ad fore|bodings on her mind.</P>

<P>WHEN Mr. Herbert returned from his walk, and met the curate and his little family at &s;upper, Sophia, who heedfully ob|&s;erved him, &s;aw an alteration in his countenance, which realized all her melancholy apprehen&s;ions, and con|vinced her that &s;ome new misfor|tune awaited her: his eyes, which &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided her's, expre&s;&s;ed nothing but grief and confu&s;ion; but he retired &s;o early to his cham|ber, that Sophia, finding there was no hopes of explaining him&s;elf that night, pa&s;&s;ed it in an anxiety of mind, which &s;uffered her not to ta&s;te the lea&s;t repo&s;e. Early in the morning he knocked at her door,
<PB N="48" REF="57">
and de&s;ired her to join him in the garden; &s;he was already dre&s;t, and in&s;tantly complied.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he came up to him, he took her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it af|fectionately, but &s;poke not a word.</P>
<P>Sophia, who feared as much as &s;he wi&s;hed to know what had hap|pened, had not power to a&s;k for an explanation; &s;o they both conti|nued &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes.</P>
<P>At length Mr. Herbert told her he was going to London; Sophia, in a faultering accent, a&s;ked him what had happened to occa&s;ion this &s;udden re&s;olution?</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear child," &s;aid the good old man, in great emotion,
<Q>I am a&s;hamed and grieved to tell you that&mdash;Sir Charles has, I fear, deceived me.</Q></P>
<P>Although Sophia had rea&s;on to expect &s;ome &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune, and had endeavoured to prepare her|&s;elf
<PB N="49" REF="58">
for it, yet this fatal confirma|tion of her fears &s;hocked her &s;o much, that Mr. Herbert, who &s;aw a death-like palene&s;s over&s;pread her face, and felt her hand cold and trembling, fearing &s;he would faint, made ha&s;te to lead her to a little bench of turf which was near them.</P>
<P>Sophia recovering, &s;aw &s;o much concern in his looks, that &s;truggling to repre&s;s her own angui&s;h, &s;he en|deavoured to comfort him, and, &s;miling through the tears that filled her charming eyes,
<Q>Let not this in&s;tance of my weakne&s;s alarm you, &s;ir,</Q>

<P>Since it is impo&s;&s;ible my mar|riage with Mi&s;s Sophia can ever take place, I could wi&s;h you would look upon all that pa&s;&s;ed between us upon that &s;ubject, as a dream: I dreamt indeed, when I ima|gined there was a woman in the world capable of a &s;incere attach|ment; and I ought to be a&s;ham|ed to own, that upon &s;o delu&s;ive a hope I was ready to act in op|po&s;ition to the general maxims of the world, and be pointed at as a &s;illy romantic fellow. However, I beg you will a&s;&s;ure the young lady, that as I have no right to blame her conduct, &s;o I have not the lea&s;t re&s;entment for it, and am &s;o perfectly at ea&s;e on this occa&s;ion, that I can with great
<PB N="52" REF="61">
&s;incerity congratulate her on her approaching happine&s;s.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Although this letter gave Sophia a &s;ad certainty of her misfortune, yet it relieved her from tho&s;e wor&s;t pangs which a heart in love can feel, the belief of being abandoned through indifference, or incon&s;tan|cy. Unperceived by our&s;elves, pride mixes with our mo&s;t tender affec|tions, and either aggravates or le&s;|&s;ens the &s;en&s;e of every di&s;appoint|ment, in proportion as we feel our|&s;elves humbled by the circum&s;tances that attend it.</P>
<P>The ill-di&s;gui&s;ed jealou&s;y, the per&s;onated calmne&s;s, the &s;truggling
<PB N="53" REF="62">
re&s;entment that appeared in this letter, convinced Sophia that Sir Charles was far from being at ea&s;e, and that to whatever cau&s;e his pre|&s;ent unaccountable behaviour was owing, yet &s;he was &s;ure at lea&s;t of not being indifferent to him.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to perceive that he had been deceived by &s;ome malicious reports, and her &s;u&s;picions fell immediately upon Harriot; but rejecting this thought, as too in|jurious to her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he returned the letter to Mr. Herbert without &s;peak|ing a word, but with a look much more &s;erene and compo&s;ed than be|fore.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who &s;aw nothing in this letter like what her pene|tration had di&s;covered, and who conceived it to be only a poor arti|fice to di&s;engage him&s;elf from pro|mi&s;es which he now repented of,
<PB N="54" REF="63">
was &s;urpri&s;ed to find her &s;o much le&s;s affected with it than expected, and a&s;ked her what &s;he thought of it?</P>
<P>Sophia told him, that &s;he was fully per&s;uaded Sir Charles had been prejudiced again&s;t her.</P>
<P>"Do you think &s;o, my dear," &s;aid he, after a little pau&s;e;
<Q>then it is your &s;i&s;ter to whom you are obliged for this kind of|fice.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope not, &s;ir," replied So|phia, &s;ighing;
<Q>that circum&s;tance would aggravate my concern&mdash; indeed I think it would be a crime in me to &s;u&s;pect her of being capable of &s;uch unkind|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>"Well," re&s;umed Mr. Herbert,
<Q>I will, if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;cover this my&s;tery before night; you &s;hall hear from me to-morrow; in the

mean time calm your mind, and re&s;ign your&s;elf entirely to that Providence, which, while you continue thus good and virtuous, will never for&s;ake you.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Sophia is vi&s;ited by Mrs. Gibbons, and makes new Di&s;coveries.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert now left her, to go and take leave of the cu|rate and his family; and Sophia, who&s;e fortune had undergone &s;o many revolutions in &s;o &s;hort a time, retired to her chamber, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed great part of the day alone, at once to indulge her melan|choly, and to conceal it from ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Dolly came up, in a great hurry of &s;pirits, to ac|quaint her that Mrs. Gibbons was come to wait upon her; that &s;he had been met at the door by her mother, and that &s;everal courte&s;ies had pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>The poor girl, though tran&s;port|ed
<PB N="57" REF="66">
with joy at this favourable be|ginning, no &s;ooner perceived, by the pen&s;ive air in Sophia's coun|tenance, and the &s;ighs that e&s;caped her, that her &s;u&s;picions of &s;ome new di&s;appointment having hap|pened to her were true, than in|&s;tantly forgetting the pro&s;perous &s;ituation of her own affairs, her &s;weet face was over&s;pread with ten|der grief, and a tear &s;tole from her eyes; but Sophia, whom nothing could have awakened from that &s;tupifying &s;orrow in which any great and &s;udden misfortune plunges the mind, but the de&s;ire of being u&s;eful to her friends, &s;oon a&s;&s;umed a more chearful look, and ha&s;tened to receive her vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons was in full dre&s;s, and had omitted no &s;uperfluous or|nament that could &s;erve to &s;hew Sophia how well &s;he under&s;tood every &s;ort of punctilio. As &s;oon as
<PB N="58" REF="67">
the fir&s;t compliments were over, "You &s;ee, madam," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>what <HI>affluence</HI> your commands have over me: I once little thought that I &s;hould ever have entered this impoli&s;hed hou&s;e again; my nephew attended me to the door, but I would not &s;uffer him to come in, becau&s;e I am not &s;ure that you are willing to let the&s;e people know the ho|nour you do him by receiving his adorations.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, though a little &s;tartled at the&s;e words, yet &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had no particular meaning in them, and a&s;cribed all to her fanta&s;tick manner of expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf; but Mrs. Gibbons being re&s;olved to ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of an affair which &s;he had very much at heart, &s;poke &s;o intelligibly at la&s;t, that Sophia could no longer be ignorant of her de&s;ign, all the ill con&s;equences
<PB N="59" REF="68">
of which &s;uddenly &s;triking her ima|gination, &s;he exclaimed in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e and terror,
<Q>Sure I am the mo&s;t unfortunate creature in the world! is it po&s;&s;ible, Mrs. Gib|bons, that you can be &s;erious? have you really given any cau&s;e for a report, that I receive your nephew's addre&s;&s;es? if you have, you have done me an irreparable injury.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia's &s;pirits were &s;o greatly a|gited that &s;he did not perceive how much of her &s;ituation the&s;e words di&s;covered; &s;o that Mrs. Gibbons, who &s;aw the tears flow fa&s;t from her eyes, immediately comprehended the whole truth.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee plainly," &s;aid &s;he, in great concern,
<Q>that I have been deceived, and others perhaps have been &s;o too; I &s;hall never <HI>di&s;capitulate</HI> my&s;elf for being the cau&s;e of any misfortune to you:
<PB N="60" REF="69">
&s;ome more advantageous <HI>treati&s;e</HI> has been on the <HI>tape&s;try,</HI> and this unlucky affair has done mi&s;chief.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Give me leave to a&s;k you, madam,</Q>
interrupted Sophia with &s;ome peevi&s;hne&s;s,
<Q>what founda|tion had you for believing that I con&s;idered your nephew as my lover? you know his heart has been long &s;ince engaged.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I acknowledge I have been to blame, my dear mi&s;s,</Q>
re&s;umed Mrs. Gibbons,
<Q>I was too <HI>&s;an|guinary</HI> in my hopes; but I beg you will <HI>di&s;claim</HI> no more, this will do no good; only tell me if it is po&s;&s;ible to repair the harm I have done by my fooli&s;h &s;chemes.</Q></P>
<P>To this Sophia made no an&s;wer; but Mrs. Gibbons, who wanted neither tenderne&s;s nor candour, and who was greatly concerned at the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;aw her under, urged her &s;o frequently, and with &s;o much
<PB N="61" REF="70">
earne&s;tne&s;s, to tell her if &s;he could be of any u&s;e in clearing up a mi&s;|take that had po&s;&s;ibly been di&s;ad|vantageous to her, that Sophia, &s;till attentive amid&s;t all her own di&s;|tre&s;&s;es to the intere&s;t of her friend, thought this a favourable opportu|nity to &s;erve her; and therefore told Mrs. Gibbons, that if &s;he was really &s;incere in her offers, there was one way.</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you, madam," interrupted Mrs. Gibbons,
<Q>and I believe I may venture to &s;ay that I thought of this <HI>expedition</HI> be|fore you did. I cannot, indeed, Mi&s;s Darnley, I cannot con&s;ent to my nephew's marriage with the young woman here; you know I have been affronted.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia now urged &s;ome argu|ments in favour of Mrs. Law&s;on, but chiefly re&s;ted her defence upon her ignorance of tho&s;e forms of po|litene&s;s
<PB N="62" REF="71">
and good breeding which Mrs. Gibbons was &s;o perfectly mi&s;tre&s;s of.</P>
<P>This compliment put the old lady into &s;o good a humour, that &s;he cried out,
<Q>Well, my dear Mi&s;s Darnley, in regard to you, I will take off the <HI>probition</HI> I laid on my nephew to vi&s;it here no more; and this I hope,</Q>
added &s;he &s;miling,
<Q>will &s;et matters right in another place; as for the re&s;t, I &s;hall take no re&s;olution till I &s;ee how they behave.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, in her tran&s;port at hav|ing &s;ucceeded &s;o well with the old lady, felt all her own griefs &s;u&s;|pended; and indeed, when &s;he re|flected upon what had happened with regard to her&s;elf, &s;he found &s;he had le&s;s cau&s;e for reflection than Mr. Herbert, or her own fears, had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons acknowledged that
<PB N="63" REF="72">
&s;he had flattered her&s;elf with the hope of her nephew's being well received by her; and that, in con|&s;equence of it, &s;he had talked of their marriage as an event which was very likely to happen, and which would give her great joy. Sophia, being fully per&s;uaded that the&s;e reports had reached Sir Charles, though by what means &s;he was not &s;o well able to determine, ea&s;ily ac|counted for that jealou&s;y and re|&s;entment which had produced &s;o &s;trange an incon&s;i&s;tency in his be|haviour, and which Mr. Herbert con&s;idered as a piece of artifice to palliate his lightne&s;s and incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The good old man, animated by his affection for the poor afflicted Sophia, rode with the utmo&s;t &s;peed to town, and alighted at the hou&s;e of the young baronet. The &s;er|vants informed him, that their ma&s;ter was in the country, which
<PB N="64" REF="73">
was all the intelligence they could give him: for they neither knew where he was, nor when he would return. Mr. Herbert, perplexed and concerned at this new di&s;ap|pointment, repaired immediately to Mrs. Darnley's, hoping to hear &s;ome news of him there.</P>
<P>Harriot, in an&s;wer to his en|quiries, told him with an air of triumph, that the &s;ame day they returned from vi&s;iting Sophia, Sir Charles had waited on her mam|ma and her, and had as u&s;ual pa&s;t great part of the afternoon with them.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who was &s;truck with this incident, endeavoured to make &s;ome di&s;coveries concerning their conver&s;ation, and Harriot's malice made this no difficult mat|ter: for &s;he could not forbear throwing out &s;ome &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t her &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e extreme &s;en&s;ibility,
<PB N="65" REF="74">
&s;he in&s;inuated, had already found out a new object.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, by his artful que&s;|tions, drew her into a confe&s;&s;ion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed between her and the baronet upon this &s;ubject; and was convinced that her ma|lignant hints had poi&s;oned his mind with &s;u&s;picions unfavourable to Sophia.</P>
<P>He went away full of indigna|tion at her treachery, and &s;till doubtful of Sir Charles's &s;incerity, who he could not &s;uppo&s;e would have been &s;o ea&s;ily influenced by Harriot's &s;ugge&s;tions, (who&s;e en|vious di&s;po&s;ition he well knew,) if his intentions had been ab&s;olute|ly right.</P>
<P>The next morning he received a letter from Sophia, in which &s;he acquainted him with the di&s;cove|ries &s;he had made; and mode&s;tly hinted her belief that Sir Charles
<PB N="66" REF="75">
had been impo&s;ed upon by this report of her intended marriage, which &s;he found was &s;pread through the village; and which, as it was very probable, he had intelligence from thence, had confirmed any idle raillery to that purpo&s;e, which her &s;i&s;ter might have indulged her|&s;elf in.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert reflecting upon all the&s;e unlucky circum&s;tances, began to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that Sir Charles had been really deceived. He went again to his hou&s;e, but had the mortification to hear from a &s;ervant whom he had not &s;een the day before, that the baronet was at his &s;eat in&mdash;</P>
<P>Thither the good old man re|&s;olved to go; the inconveniencies and expence of &s;uch a journey, which in his years, and narrow circum&s;tances were not incon&s;i|derable, had not weight enough
<PB N="67" REF="76">
with him to make him balance a moment whether he &s;hould tran&s;act this affair by letter, or in per&s;on. The happine&s;s of his dear and amiable charge depend|ed upon his &s;ucce&s;s: he therefore delayed no longer than to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for his journey, and, after writing to So|phia to acquaint her with his de|&s;ign, he &s;et out for Sir Charles's &s;eat, where he met with a new and more &s;evere di&s;appointment. The fir&s;t news he heard was, that the baronet was not in that part of the country; and upon a fuller enquiry of his &s;ervants, he was informed that their ma&s;ter had the morning before &s;et out for Dover with an intention to go to Paris.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, di&s;pirited with this news, and fatigued with his fruit|le&s;s journey, retired to his inn,
<PB N="68" REF="77">
where he pa&s;&s;ed the lonely hours in melancholy reflections upon the capricious behaviour of Sir Charles, and the unde&s;erved di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the innocent Sophia.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIV.</HI> Di&s;plays certain &s;ingularities in the character of Sophia, and their ef|fects on the heart of Sir Charles.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Charles, however, notwith|&s;tanding appearances, was at pre&s;ent more unhappy than guilty. His re&s;olution to marry Sophia, though &s;uddenly formed, was not the le&s;s &s;incere: he had always loved her with the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;|&s;ion, and had not the light charac|ter of her mother and &s;i&s;ter con|curred with tho&s;e prejudices which his youth, his fortune, and his conver&s;e with the gay world led him into, his heart, which had never cea&s;ed to do homage to her virtue, would have &s;ooner &s;ugge&s;ted to him the only means of being truly happy.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="79">An over&s;trained delicacy likewi&s;e proved another &s;ource of di&s;|quietude to him. The inequality of their circum&s;tances gave ri&s;e to a thou&s;and tormenting doubts: he was afraid, that dazzled with the &s;plendor of his fortune, &s;he would &s;acrifice her inclinations to her in|tere&s;t, and give him her hand with|out her heart; and when doing ju&s;|tice to the greatne&s;s of her mind, and the real delicacy of her &s;enti|ments, he rejected this &s;uppo&s;ition as injurious to her, his bu&s;y imagi|nation conjured up new forms of di&s;tru&s;t: he trembled left, mi&s;tak|ing gratitude for love, &s;he &s;hould be deceived by her own genero&s;ity and nice &s;en&s;e of obligation, and ima|gine it was the lover &s;he preferred, when the benefactor only touched her heart.</P>
<P>Such was the perplexed &s;tate of his mind, when Mrs. Darnley and
<PB N="71" REF="80">
Harriot propo&s;ed making her a vi&s;it. With &s;ome difficulty he conquered his de&s;ire of accompanying them; but his impatience to hear of her, carried him again to Mrs. Darnley's much earlier in the evening than it was likely they would return; pre|&s;uming on his intimacy in the fa|mily, he &s;crupled not to go up &s;tairs, telling the &s;ervant he would wait till the ladies came home.</P>
<P>He &s;at down in the dining-room, where he gazed on Sophia's picture a long time. At la&s;t a &s;udden fancy &s;eized him to vi&s;it her apartment, which he knew was on the &s;econd floor: he a&s;cended the &s;tairs with|out being perceived, and with a tender emotion entered the room where his beloved Sophia u&s;ed to pa&s;s &s;o many of her retired hours.</P>
<P>It was &s;till elegantly neat, as when its lovely inmate was there; for
<PB N="72" REF="81">
Harriot, who hated this room be|cau&s;e it contained &s;o many monu|ments of her &s;i&s;ter's ta&s;te and indu&s;|try, never went into it; and it re|mained in the &s;ame order that &s;he had left it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that drew the young baronet's attention, was a fire-&s;creen of excellent workman|&s;hip; it was a flower-piece, and executed with peculiar ta&s;te and propriety: the wain&s;cot was adorned with &s;everal drawings, neatly fram|ed and gla&s;&s;ed. In this art Sophia took great delight, having while her farther lived appropriated all her pocket money to the payment of a ma&s;ter to in&s;truct her in it. Sir Charles con&s;idered the &s;ubjects of the&s;e drawings with a peculiar plea|&s;ure. The delicate pencil of So|phia had here repre&s;ented the Vir|tues and the Graces, from tho&s;e lively ideas which exi&s;ted in her own charming mind.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="82">Her little library next engaged his notice: many of the books that compo&s;ed it he had pre&s;ented her; but he was curious to &s;ee tho&s;e which her own choice had directed her to, and in this examination he met with many proofs of her piety as well as of the excellence of her ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Several compo&s;itions of her own now fell into his hands: he read them with eagerne&s;s, and, charm|ed with this di&s;covery of tho&s;e trea|&s;ures of wit, which &s;he with mo|de&s;t diffidence &s;o carefully concealed, he felt his admiration and tenderne&s;s for her encrea&s;e every moment.</P>
<P>While he was anxiou&s;ly &s;earching for more of her papers, a little &s;ha|green ca&s;e fell from one of the &s;helves upon the ground. He took it up, and as every thing that be|longed to her excited his curio&s;ity, he opened it immediately, and with
<PB N="74" REF="83">
equal &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;aw his own miniature in water colours, which was evidently the perfor|mance of Sophia her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Had it been po&s;&s;ible for her to imagine the &s;udden and powerful effect the &s;ight of this picture would have upon the heart of Sir Charles, &s;he would not have &s;uffered &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s for the lo&s;s of it as &s;he really had; for, forgetting where &s;he had laid it, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it had dropt out of her pocket, and was apprehen&s;ive of its hav|ing fallen into her &s;i&s;ter's hands, who &s;he knew would not fail to turn this incident to her di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P>While Sir Charles gazed upon this artle&s;s te&s;timony of Sophia's affection for him, the &s;ofte&s;t gra|titude, the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, filled his &s;oul. "Oh, my So|phia,"
&s;aid he,
<Q>do you then
<PB N="75" REF="84">
truly love me! and have I cruelly trifled with your tender|ne&s;s!</Q></P>
<P>This thought melted him even to tears; he felt in him&s;elf a de|te&s;tation of tho&s;e depraved prin|ciples which had &s;ugge&s;ted to him a de&s;ign of deba&s;ing &s;uch purity! he wondered at the hardne&s;s of his own heart, that could &s;o long re&s;i&s;t the influence of her gentle virtues, and &s;uffer &s;uch &s;weet &s;en|&s;ibility to wa&s;te it&s;elf in anxi|ous doubts, and di&s;appointed hope.</P>
<P>Being now determined to do ju&s;tice to her merit, and make him&s;elf happy, his fir&s;t de&s;ign was to go immediately to Mr. Law&s;on's; but, reflecting that Sophia had great rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with his conduct; and that, to remove her prejudices,
<PB N="76" REF="85">
the utmo&s;t caution and delicacy was to be ob&s;erved, he conceived it would be more proper to make a direct application to Mr. Her|bert, whom &s;he loved and reve|renced as a father, than to pre|&s;ent him&s;elf before her, while her mind yet laboured with tho&s;e unfavourable &s;u&s;picions for which he had given but too much cau&s;e; and hence new fears and doubts aro&s;e to torment him. He dread|ed le&s;t her ju&s;t re&s;entment for his injurious de&s;igns &s;hould have weak|ened tho&s;e tender impre&s;&s;ions &s;he had once received; and that, in the pride of offended virtue, every &s;ofter &s;entiment would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Impatient of this cruel &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and inquietude, he left Sophia's apartment, and repairing to the dining-room, rang the bell
<PB N="77" REF="86">
for the &s;ervant, of whom he en|quired where Mr. Herbert lodged. Having obtained a direction, he went immediately to the hou&s;e; Mr. Herbert was not at home, and Sir Charles, grieved at this di&s;appointment, and at Mrs. Darnley's not returning that night, from whom he hoped to have heard &s;ome news of Sophia; the agitation of his mind made him think it an age till the next day, in which he determined to put an end to all his perplexities, and to fix his fate.</P>
<P>After his interview with Mr. Herbert, and the good old man's departure, to prepare Sophia for his intended vi&s;it, the young ba|ronet re&s;igned his whole &s;oul to tenderne&s;s and joy. His impati|ence to &s;ee Sophia encrea&s;ed with his hope of finding her &s;enti|ments
<PB N="78" REF="87">
for him unchanged, and he regretted a thou&s;and times his having &s;uffered Mr. Herbert to go away without him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXV.</HI> Lets the reader into &s;ome circum|&s;tances that help to di&s;play Sir Charles's conduct.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN time a card came from Mrs. Darnley and Harriot, acquainting him that they were re|turned, and thanking him for the u&s;e of his &s;ervants and chariot. Sir Charles, eager to hear news of his Sophia, went immediately to wait on them; and &s;carce were the fir&s;t compliments over, when he enquir|ed for her with &s;uch apparent emo|tion, that, Harriot mortified to the la&s;t degree, re&s;olved to be even with him, and &s;aid every thing that &s;he thought would torment him, and prejudice her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>She told him that Sophia was the mo&s;t contented creature in the
<PB N="80" REF="89">
world; and that &s;he was &s;o charmed with her pre&s;ent way of life, and her new companions, that &s;he &s;eemed to have forgot all her old friends, and even her relations.
<Q>She is grown a meer country girl,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>is always wan|dering about in the fields and meadows, followed by a young ru&s;tic who has fallen in love with her. I rallied her a little upon her ta&s;te; but I found &s;he could not bear it, and indeed he is ex|tremely hand&s;ome, and &s;he &s;ays, has had a genteel education.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot was at once plea&s;ed and grieved at ob&s;erving the effect the&s;e in&s;inuations had on Sir Charles; his colour changed, he trembled, and fixing his eyes on the ground, he remained pen&s;ive and &s;ilent, while Harriot, notwith&s;tanding her mo|ther's in&s;ignificant frowns, proceed|ed in a malicious detail of little cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="81" REF="90">
partly invented, and partly mi&s;taken, which fixed the &s;harpe&s;t &s;tings of jealou&s;y in his heart.</P>
<P>If in dealing with cunning per|&s;ons we were always to con&s;ider their ends, in order to interpret their &s;peeches, much of their arti|fice would lo&s;e its effect; but Sir Charles had &s;o contemptible an opi|nion of Harriot's under&s;tanding, that although he knew &s;he was ma|licious, he never &s;u&s;pected her of being capable of laying &s;chemes to gratify her malice; and did not &s;up|po&s;e &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of invention enough to form &s;o plau&s;ible a tale as that &s;he had told.</P>
<P>Impatient under tho&s;e cruel doubts which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, he re&s;olved to go, late as it was in the evening, to Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e; and taking an abrupt leave of Mrs. Darnley and her daughter, he went
<PB N="82" REF="91">
home, and ordered his hor&s;es to be got ready. He &s;carce knew his own de&s;ign by taking this journey at &s;o improper a time; but in the ex|treme agitation of his mind, the fir&s;t idea of relief that naturally pre&s;ented it&s;elf was to &s;ee Sophia, who alone could de&s;troy or confirm his fears; and this he eagerly pur|&s;ued without any farther reflection.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant to whom he had &s;ent his orders, made no ha&s;te to exe|cute them, as conceiving it to be a mo&s;t extravagant whim in his ma&s;|ter to &s;et out upon a journey &s;o late, and in that manner. While he with &s;tudied delays protracted the time, hoping for &s;ome change in his re&s;o|lutions, Sir Charles racked with impatience, counted moments for hours; me&s;&s;age after me&s;&s;age was di&s;patched to the groom. The hor&s;es at length were brought, and Sir Charles, with only one &s;ervant,
<PB N="83" REF="92">
galloped away, never &s;topping till he came to the place where Sophia re&s;ided.</P>
<P>It was now night, and the inde|corum of making a vi&s;it at &s;uch a time in a family where he was a &s;tranger, fir&s;t &s;triking his thoughts, he re&s;olved to alight at an inn which he &s;aw at a &s;mall di&s;tance, and there con&s;ider what it was be&s;t for him to do.</P>
<P>A gue&s;t of his appearance &s;oon engaged the attention of the ho&s;t and his wife. They quitted two men with whom they had been talking, and, with a great deal of officious civility, attended upon Sir Charles, who de&s;ired to be &s;hewn into a room. As he was following the good woman, who declared he &s;hould have the be&s;t in her hou&s;e, the two per&s;ons before mentioned, bowed to him when he pa&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="84" REF="93">
them; the &s;alute of the younger having a certain grace in it that drew his attention, he looked back on him, and at the &s;ight of a very hand&s;ome face, and a per&s;on un|commonly genteel, his heart, by its throbbing emotions, immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that this beau|tiful youth was the lover of his So|phia.</P>
<P>The jealou&s;y which Harriot's in|&s;inuations had kindled in his heart, now raged with redoubled force; this rival, whom &s;he had called a ru&s;tic, and whom he fondly hoped to find &s;uch, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t at|tractive graces of form, and proba|bly wanted neither wit nor polite|ne&s;s. Sophia's youth, her tender|ne&s;s, her &s;en&s;ibility, wounded by his di&s;&s;embled indifference, and the cruel capriciou&s;ne&s;s of his conduct, all di&s;po&s;ed her to receive a new
<PB N="85" REF="94">
impre&s;&s;ion, and who &s;o proper to touch her heart as this lovely youth, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, as innocent as it was ardent and &s;incere, bani&s;hed all doubt and &s;u&s;picion, and left her whole &s;oul open to the &s;oft pleadings of gratitude and love?</P>
<P>While he was wholly ab&s;orbed in the&s;e tormenting reflections, and incapable of taking any re&s;oluti|on, the officious landlady entered his chamber to take his orders for &s;upper.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, &s;urpri&s;ed to find it was &s;o late, re&s;olved to &s;tay there all night, and after giving the good woman &s;ome directions, his re&s;tle&s;s curio&s;ity impelled him to a&s;k her &s;everal que&s;tions con|cerning the old man and the youth whom he had &s;een talking to her.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="95">The ho&s;te&s;s, who was as com|municative as he could de&s;ire, told him, that the old man was one farmer Gibbons, of whom &s;he had been buying a load of hay; that the young one was his &s;on, and a great &s;cholard.
<Q>His aunt, pur&s;ued &s;he, breeds him up to be a gentleman; and &s;he has a power of money, and de&s;igns to leave it all to him, much good may it do him, for he is as hand&s;ome a young man as one would de&s;ire to &s;ee. Some time ago it was all over our town that he was go|ing to be married to the par&s;on's younge&s;t daughter, and &s;he is a pretty creature, and <HI>di&s;arves</HI> him if he was more richer and hand|&s;omer than he is; but whatever is the matter, the old folks have changed their mind, and his
<PB N="87" REF="96">
aunt, they &s;ay, wants to make up a match between him and a fine London lady that boards at the par&s;on's; but I'll never believe it till I &s;ee it, for &s;he and the par|&s;on's daughter are great friends, they &s;ay, and it would not be a friendly part to rob the poor girl of her &s;weetheart. To &s;ay the truth, I believe there is &s;ome juggling among them; but this I keep to my&s;elf, for I would not make mi&s;chief; therefore I never tell my thoughts to any body, but I wi&s;h the young folks well.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, who had li&s;tened to her with great emotion, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed her now, that he might be at liberty to reflect on what he had heard, which, although it did not lead him to a full di&s;covery of the truth, yet it &s;ugge&s;ted thoughts which relieved

him in &s;ome degree from tho&s;e dreadful pangs of jealou&s;y with which he had hitherto been tortured, and ballanced at lea&s;t his fears and his hopes.</P>

<P>HIS impatience to free him&s;elf from this &s;tate of perplexity and &s;u&s;pence, allowed him but little repo&s;e that night; he ro&s;e as &s;oon as the day appeared, and it was with &s;ome difficulty that he prevailed up|on him&s;elf to defer his vi&s;it till a &s;ea|&s;onable hour; and then being in|formed that Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e was &s;carce a mile di&s;tant, he left his &s;er|vant and hor&s;es at the inn, and walk|ed thither, amid&s;t a thou&s;and anxi|ous thoughts, which made him dread as much as he wi&s;hed for an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter|view, which was to decide his fate.</P>
<P>As he drew near the hou&s;e, he perceived a young man &s;auntering
<PB N="90" REF="99">
about in an adjacent field, who&s;e air and mien had a great re&s;emb|lance of the youth whom he had &s;een in the inn. Sir Charles, eager to &s;atisfy his doubts, followed him at a di&s;tance, and the youth turning again his wi&s;hing eyes towards the hou&s;e, the baronet had a full view of his face.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of his young rival his heart throbbed as if it would leave his brea&s;t: he ha&s;tily retreated be|hind a hedge, determined to watch his motions; for he imagined, and with rea&s;on, that he came there to meet his mi&s;tre&s;s; and who that mi|&s;tre&s;s was, whether Sophia, or the curate's daughter, was the di&s;tract|ing doubt, which he now expected to have &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>He walked along by the &s;ide of the hedge, &s;till keeping William in &s;ight, who &s;uddenly turning back, rather flew than ran to meet a wo|man
<PB N="91" REF="100">
who beckoned to him. Sir Charles &s;aw at once his Sophia, and the fatal &s;ign, which planted a thou|&s;and daggers in his heart. Tremb|ling and pale he leaned again&s;t a tree, which concealed him from view, and &s;aw her advance towards his ri|val, &s;aw her in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with him; and, to compleat his di&s;trac|tion and de&s;pair, &s;aw the happy youth throw him&s;elf at her feet, doubtle&s;s to thank her for the &s;acri|fice &s;he made to him of a richer lover.</P>
<P>Such was the inference he drew from this action; and now rage and indignation &s;ucceeding to grief, in the&s;e fir&s;t tran&s;ports, he was upon the point of di&s;covering him&s;elf, and &s;acrificing the hated youth to his vengeance; but a moment's re|flection &s;hewed him the di&s;honour of a conte&s;t with &s;o de&s;picable a ri|val, and turned all his re&s;entment

Sir Charles followed her with di&s;ordered ha&s;te, re&s;olved to load her with reproaches for her incon&s;tancy: then, unwil|ling to gratify her pride by &s;uch an acknowledgment of his weakne&s;s, he turned back, cur&s;ing love, wo|men, and his own ill fate. In this temper he wandered about a long time; at la&s;t he again returned to the inn, where, after having given orders to have his hor&s;es got ready, he wrote that letter to Mr. Herbert, in which he &s;o well di&s;gui&s;ed the an|gui&s;h of his heart, that the good old man believed his breaking off the af|fair was the effect of his lightne&s;s and incon&s;tancy only, though Sophia's quicker penetration ea&s;ily di&s;covered the latent jealou&s;y that had dictated it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles ordered his &s;ervant to
<PB N="93" REF="104">
deliver the letter into Mr. Herbert's hands; then mounting his hor&s;e, he bid him follow him as &s;oon as he had executed his commi&s;&s;ion.

<P>The good old man being obliged to &s;end Sophia this bad news, filled his letter with tender con&s;olations, and wi&s;e and prudent cou&s;nels: he exorted her to bear this &s;troke of fortune with that dignity of patience which di&s;tingui&s;hes the good and wi&s;e.</P>

<P>THE lo&s;s of Sir Charles hav|ing clouded all Sophia's views of happine&s;s, &s;he earne&s;tly intreated Mr. Herbert's permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ettle her&s;elf in that humble &s;ta|tion to which Providence &s;eemed to call her; and as &s;he believed Mrs. Gibbons might be very u&s;eful to her upon this occa&s;ion, &s;he re&s;olved to apply to her as &s;oon as &s;he had his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all her endea|vours to bear this &s;hock of fate with patience, a fixed melancholy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, con|vinced that Sir Charles had loved her; and that, by an unfortunate concurrence of circum&s;tances, he
<PB N="97" REF="108">
had been prevented from giving her the utmo&s;t proof of his affection; her tenderne&s;s no longer combat|ted by &s;u&s;picions to his prejudice, gained new force every day, and all his actions now appeared to her in a favourable point of view: &s;o true it is, that when a per&s;on is found le&s;s guilty than he is &s;u&s;pected, he is concluded more innocent than he really is.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, after a long &s;ilence, at length acquainted her, that he was ill, and de&s;ired her not to leave Mr. Law&s;on's till &s;he heard further from him.</P>
<P>The &s;hortne&s;s of this billet, the trembling hand with which it ap|peared to be written, filled Sophia with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen|&s;ions. Sir Charles was now forgot, and all her thoughts were taken up with the danger of her worthy friend: &s;he determined to go to
<PB N="98" REF="109">
him; and although Mr. Law&s;on and his wife endeavoured to di&s;|&s;uade her from taking &s;uch a jour|ney, and William, urged by Dol|ly, and his own eagerne&s;s to &s;erve her, offered to go and bring her an exact account of the &s;tate of his health, yet her purpo&s;e remained unalterable.</P>
<P>"My dear benefactor is ill," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>and has none but &s;trangers about him; it is fit that I &s;hould go and attend him;</Q>
and if I mu&s;t lo&s;e him, pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>bur&s;ting into tears, it will be &s;ome comfort to me to reflect that I have done my duty.</Q></P>
<P>She &s;et out early the next morn|ing in the &s;tage-coach: Dolly wept at parting, and engaged her lover to attend Sophia to her jour|ney's end; that if Mr. Herbert &s;hould be wor&s;e than they appre|hended,
<PB N="99" REF="110">
he might be near to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort her.</P>
<P>Sophia, when &s;he &s;aw him rid|ing by the &s;ide of the coach, at|tempted to per&s;uade him to re|turn; but William charmed to have an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his zeal for her &s;ervice, would not quit her; and her &s;pirits being too weak to conte&s;t this point with him, &s;he was obliged to &s;uffer his attendance.</P>
<P>They reached the place where Mr. Herbert was, in the even|ing of the third day: he had taken lodgings at the hou&s;e of a farmer, where he was attended with great tenderne&s;s and care.</P>
<P>Sophia appeared with &s;o deep a concern upon her countenance, and enquired for him with &s;uch extreme emotion, that the good woman of the hou&s;e concluding
<PB N="100" REF="111">
&s;he was his daughter, thought it nece&s;&s;ary before &s;he an&s;wered her que&s;tions, to preach patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her, wi&s;ely ob&s;erving, that we are all mortal, and that death &s;pares nobody, from the &s;quire to the plough|man.</P>
<P>She ran on in this manner till &s;he perceived Sophia grow pale, and clo&s;e her eyes: &s;he had ju&s;t time to prevent her from falling, and with William's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, placed her in a chair, where while &s;he applied remedies to recover her from her &s;woon, the youth with tears in his eyes, a&s;ked her &s;oftly, how long Mr. Herbert had been dead.</P>
<P>"Dead!" repeated the farmer's wife,
<Q>who told you he was dead? no, no, it is not &s;o bad as that neither.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="112">William rejoiced to hear this, and as &s;oon as Sophia &s;hewed &s;ome &s;igns of returning life, he greeted her with the welcome news. She ca&s;t a look full of doubt and angui&s;h upon the countrywoman, who confirmed his report, and offered to go with her to the gentleman's room. Sophia in&s;tantly found her &s;trength return; &s;he followed her with trembling ha&s;te; and, le&s;t her pre&s;ence &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e Mr. Herbert, &s;he directed the good woman to tell him, that a friend of his was come to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>She heard him an&s;wer in a weak voice, but with &s;ome emo|tion,
<Q>It is my dear child, bring her to me.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia immediately appeared, and throwing her&s;elf upon her

knees at his bed-&s;ide, bur&s;t into tears, and was unable to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The good old man holding one of her hands pre&s;t in his, tender|ly blamed her for the trouble &s;he had given her&s;elf in coming &s;o far to vi&s;it him; but acknow|ledged at the &s;ame time, that this in&s;tance of her affection was ex|tremely dear to him, and that her pre&s;ence gave him inexpre&s;&s;i|ble comfort.</P>
<P>Sophia entered immediately upon the office of a nur&s;e to her bene|factor, and performed all the duties of the mo&s;t affectionate child to the be&s;t of parents.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert employed the little remaining &s;trength he had in en|deavours to comfort her, and in pious exhortations.
<Q>Weep not for me, my dear child,</Q>
would he &s;ay,

<P>SOPHIA had need of all the con&s;olation &s;he derived from her reflections on the virtue and piety of her friend, to enable her to bear the apprehen&s;ions of his approaching death with any degree of fortitude; but when &s;he lea&s;t expected it, his di&s;temper took a favourable turn, and in a few days the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptons were removed.</P>
<P>The Bath waters being judged ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the entire re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health, he re&s;olved to go thither as &s;oon as he had recovered &s;trength enough to bear the journey.</P>
<P>Sophia at his earne&s;t de&s;ire con|&s;ented to return to Mr. Law&s;on's,
<PB N="106" REF="117">
and remain there till he came from Bath, but &s;he would not quit him till he was able to take this jour|ney; and by the &s;weetne&s;s of her conver&s;ation, her tender a&s;&s;iduity, and watchful care, contributed &s;o much towards his recovery, that he was &s;oon in a condition to travel with &s;afety.</P>
<P>He accompanied her the fir&s;t day's journey to Mr. Law&s;on's; and being met at the inn by this worthy friend and young William, he con&s;igned his beloved charge to their care, and pur&s;ued his way to Bath.</P>
<P>Sophia was received with great joy by Mrs. Law&s;on and her daugh|ters: Dolly hung a long time upon her neck in tran&s;ports, and as &s;oon as they were alone, informed her that Mrs. Gibbons and her mother were perfectly reconciled; that &s;he had con&s;ented to her nephew's
<PB N="107" REF="118">
marriage, and even &s;hewed an im|patience to conclude it:
<Q>but I prevailed,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>to have the ceremony delayed till you, my dear friend, could be pre|&s;ent; for I could not think of being happy, while you to whom I owe all, was afflicted.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia embraced her tenderly, congratulated her upon her change of fortune, and gave many prai&s;es to her lover, to whom &s;he acknow|ledged great obligations for his care and attention to her.</P>
<P>Dolly's cheeks glowed with plea|&s;ure while &s;he heard her William commended by one whom &s;he &s;o much loved and revered.</P>
<P>The young lovers were married a few days afterwards; and Sophia&punc; who had &s;o earne&s;tly endeavoured to bring about this union, and had &s;uffered &s;o much in her own intere&s;t by her &s;olicitude concerning it, was
<PB N="108" REF="119">
one of tho&s;e to whom it gave the mo&s;t &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Mean time Mr. Herbert conti|nued indi&s;po&s;ed at Bath, and Sophia unea&s;y, le&s;t in this increa&s;e of his expences, her re&s;idence at Mr. Law&s;on's &s;hould lay him under &s;ome difficulties, re&s;olved to ea&s;e him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible of the charge of her maintenance: &s;he explained her &s;ituation to Mrs. Gibbons, and re|que&s;ted her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in procuring her a place.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons expre&s;&s;ed great tenderne&s;s and concern for her upon this occa&s;ion, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would employ all her intere&s;t in her &s;ervice. She accordingly men|tioned her with great prai&s;e to a widow lady of a very affluent for|tune, who had e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a character for genero&s;ity and good|ne&s;s, that &s;he hoped, if &s;he could be induced to take Sophia under
<PB N="109" REF="120">
her protection her fortune would be made.</P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, &s;o was the lady called, no &s;ooner heard that a young woman of merit, well born, and genteely educated was reduced to go to &s;ervice for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, than &s;he exclaimed with great vehemence again&s;t the avarice and luxury of the rich and great, who either hoarded for their unthankful heirs, or lavi&s;hed in expen&s;ive plea&s;ures, tho&s;e &s;uperfluous &s;ums which ought to be applied to the relief of the indigent.
<Q>Oh that I had a for|tune,</Q>
cried &s;he,
<Q>as large as my heart, there &s;hould not be one di&s;tre&s;&s;ed per&s;on in the world! I mu&s;t &s;ee this young lady Mrs. Gibbons, and I mu&s;t do &s;omething for her. You have obliged me infinitely by putting it in my power to gra|tify the unbounded benevolence

<P>This lady, who had made an early di&s;covery of Sophia's economical talents, &s;et her to work immediately after her arrival; her ta&s;k was to embroider a white &s;attin negligee, which &s;he undertook with great readine&s;s, plea&s;ed at having an op|portunity of obliging a woman of &s;o generous a di&s;po&s;ition, and in &s;ome degree to requite her for her ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>Mrs. Howard indeed always pre|vented tho&s;e on whom &s;he conferred favours, from incurring the guilt of ingratitude; for &s;he took care to be fully repaid for any act of benevo|lence; and having a wonderful art in extracting advantage to her&s;elf from the nece&s;&s;ities of others, &s;he &s;ometimes &s;ought out the unfortu|nate with a &s;olicitude that did great

<P>It has been well ob&s;erved that what is called liberality is often no more than the vanity of giving, of which &s;ome per&s;ons are fonder than of what they give. But the vanity of giving publicly is mo&s;t prevailing; and hence it happens, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t celebrated for their charity, are in reality lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the feelings of humanity: and
<PB N="113" REF="124">
the &s;ame per&s;ons from whom the mo&s;t affecting repre&s;entation of pri|vate di&s;tre&s;s could not force the lea&s;t relief, have been among the fir&s;t to &s;end their contributions to any new foundation.</P>
<P>Sophia knew not how to recon|cile many circum&s;tances in Mrs. Howard's conduct with her general profe&s;&s;ions of benevolence and ge|nero&s;ity; but that lady had been &s;o u&s;ed to di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf to others; that at la&s;t &s;he did not know her&s;elf; and the warmth and vehemence with which &s;he delivered her &s;enti|ments impo&s;ed almo&s;t as much up|on her&s;elf as her hearers.</P>
<P>Sophia's amiable qualities how|ever &s;oon produced their u&s;ual ef|fects, and in&s;pired Mrs. Howard with as much friend&s;hip for her as &s;o intere&s;ted a temper was capable of. She wi&s;hed to &s;ee her fortune e&s;tabli&s;hed, and was very de&s;irous of

A country lady of her acquaintance coming one day to vi&s;it her, with her &s;on, a clown|i&s;h ignorant youth, Mrs. Howard was encouraged by the frequent glances he gave Sophia, to form a &s;cheme for marrying her to him; and in this &s;he fore&s;aw &s;o many po&s;|&s;ible advantages to her&s;elf from So|phia's grateful di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;he pur&s;ued it with the mo&s;t anxious &s;o|licitude.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIX.</HI> Mrs. Howard is taken in her own &s;nare.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Barton, &s;o was the young &s;quire called, having con|ceived a liking for Sophia, repeated his vi&s;its frequently, emboldened by Mrs. Howard's civilities, who took every occa&s;ion of prai&s;ing Sophia, and in&s;inuating that he would be extremely happy in &s;uch a wife.</P>
<P>She &s;ometimes left him alone with Sophia, in hopes that he would declare his pa&s;&s;ion to her: but the ru&s;tic, awed by the dignity of her per&s;on and manners, dur&s;t not even rai&s;e his eyes to look on her; &s;o that Mrs. Howard, finding the affair did not advance &s;o fa&s;t as &s;he wi&s;hed, rallied Sophia upon her ill-timed re&s;erve, and hinted her
<PB N="116" REF="127">
views in her favour, which &s;he con|&s;idering as an effect of her friend|&s;hip, li&s;tened with re&s;pect, and even gratitude, though her heart refu&s;ed to concur in them.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of Mrs. Howard's only &s;on, a youth about nineteen, who had come from the univer&s;ity to pa&s;s a few days with his mother. As &s;oon as &s;he quitted Sophia, he approach|ed her, and, with a look of tender|ne&s;s and concern, told her,
<Q>He was &s;orry to find his mother &s;o zealous an advocate for Mr. Bar|ton, who could not po&s;&s;ibly de|&s;erve her.</Q></P>
<P>"Nor can I po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve him," replied Sophia with a &s;mile;
<Q>he is too rich.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Love only and merit can de|&s;erve you,</Q>
re&s;umed the young &s;tudent, &s;ighing,
<Q>and if love were
<PB N="117" REF="128">
merit, I know one who might &mdash;hope&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed and he&s;itated, and So|phia, to whom the language of love in any mouth but Sir Charles's was odious, &s;uddenly quitted him, to avoid the continuance of a di&s;cour&s;e which &s;he con&s;idered as mere un|meaning gallantry.</P>
<P>Mean time, her ru&s;tic lover not having courage enough to declare his pa&s;&s;ion to her, had recour&s;e to the indulgence of his mother, who till that time had never refu&s;ed any of his de&s;ires.</P>
<P>He told her that he never liked any young woman &s;o well in his life as Mrs. Sophia Darnley; and that he was &s;ure &s;he would make a good wife, becau&s;e Mrs. Howard had told him &s;o, and encouraged him to break his mind to her, but he was a&s;hamed: he declared he
<PB N="118" REF="129">
would marry no body el&s;e, and begged his mother to get her for him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Barton, full of rage again&s;t her neighbour, for thus endeavour|ing to en&s;nare her &s;on into a mar|riage, as &s;he conceived unworthy of him, re&s;olved to go to her, and load her with reproaches. While her chariot was getting ready, &s;he con|tinued to que&s;tion her &s;on, and heard a great many particulars from him, which convinced her that his affections were more deeply engag|ed than &s;he had imagined.</P>
<P>After ordering the young &s;quire to be locked up till her return, &s;he flew to Mrs. Howard, and, with the mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of rage, upbraided her with the treacherous part &s;he had acted, by &s;educing her &s;on into a liking for a poor crea|ture, who was a dependent upon
<PB N="119" REF="130">
her charity, and whom &s;he took this method to get rid of.</P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, who held Mrs. Barton in great contempt, on ac|count of her ignorance, and valued her&s;elf extremely upon her philo|&s;ophic command over her pa&s;&s;ions, li&s;tened with an affected calmne&s;s to all Mrs. Barton's invectives; and when &s;he found &s;he had railed her|&s;elf out of breath, &s;he began to declaim in a &s;olemn accent again&s;t avarice, and that vile &s;ordid di&s;po|&s;ition of parents, who, in the mar|riage of their children, preferred the dro&s;s of riches to the real trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and virtue. She very charitably lamented Mrs. Barton's want of di&s;cernment, and littlene&s;s of mind; and concluded that Mi&s;s Sophia's merit rendered her de&s;erv|ing of a hu&s;band even more con|&s;iderable than Mr. Barton.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="131">
<Q>Then marry her to your own &s;on,</Q>
replied Mrs. Barton, with a &s;neer;
<Q>no doubt but he will be more worthy of her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If my &s;on &s;hould declare a pa&s;|&s;ion for Mi&s;s Sophia,</Q>
re&s;umed Mrs. Howard,
<Q>it would &s;oon be &s;een how far my &s;entiments are exalted above yours.</Q></P>
<P>"I am glad to hear this," re|turned Mrs. Barton,
<Q>for I am very &s;ure Mr. Howard is in love with this wonderful creature whom you prai&s;e &s;o much; and &s;ince you are &s;o willing to make her your daughter-in-law, I &s;hall be under no fear of my &s;on's marrying her.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, at this unexpected &s;troke, turned as pale as death, and, with a faultering voice, a&s;ked her,
<Q>What rea&s;on &s;he had for &s;up|po&s;ing her &s;on was in love with Mi&s;s Sophia?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="132">Mrs. Barton, who enjoyed her perplexity and confu&s;ion, &s;uffered her to repeat her que&s;tions &s;everal times, and then maliciou&s;ly referred her to the young gentleman him|&s;elf, "Who," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>upon finding you &s;o favourably di&s;|po&s;ed, will, I doubt not, be ready enough to own his inclina|tions.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard was now &s;o far humbled, that &s;he conde&s;cended to to intreat Mrs. Barton to tell her what &s;he knew of this affair.</P>
<P>"All my information," &s;aid Mrs. Barton,
<Q>comes from my &s;on, to whom Mr. Howard, con&s;idering him as his rival, declared his better right to the lady, as hav|ing fir&s;t acquainted her with his pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>At this intelligence Mrs. How|ard's rage got &s;o much the better of her prudence, that &s;he uttered a
<PB N="122" REF="133">
thou&s;and invectives again&s;t the in|nocent Sophia, which drew &s;ome &s;evere &s;arca&s;ms from Mrs. Barton who being now fully revenged, ro&s;e up to be gone; but Mrs. Howard, &s;en&s;ible that a quarrel upon this oc|ca&s;ion might have con&s;equences very unfavourable to her reputation, &s;eized her hand, and led her half reluctant, again to her chair, where after &s;he had &s;oothed her into good humour, by &s;ome flattering expre&s;|&s;ions, which coming from one of her acknowledged under&s;tanding, had great weight. She told her with the mo&s;t unblu&s;hing confi|dence, that &s;he was now convinced &s;he had been deceived in the cha|racter of the young woman on whom &s;he had with her u&s;ual gene|ro&s;ity conferred &s;o many benefits.
<Q>I find to my inexpre&s;&s;ible con|cern,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>that this mode&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, and virtuous young
<PB N="123" REF="134">
creature, as I once believed her, is in reality an artful hypocrite, who&s;e only aim is to make her fortune, by en&s;naring &s;ome unex|perienced youth into a marriage. Let us join our endeavours then, my dear Mrs. Barton, to pre&s;erve our &s;ons from this danger: this is a common cau&s;e, all mothers are concerned in it; we will &s;hew the young di&s;&s;embler in her proper colours, and prevent her impo&s;ing upon others as &s;he has done upon us.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Barton, who never carried her reflections very far, was &s;o well plea&s;ed with Mrs. Howard's pre&s;ent behaviour, that &s;he forgot all the pa&s;t: the&s;e two ladies became on a &s;udden the be&s;t friends in the world, and this union was to be cemented with the ruin of Sophia's fame, &s;uch beginnings have certain female

<P>Mrs. Barton propo&s;ed to have her &s;ent for into their pre&s;ence, and af|ter reproaching her &s;everely, di&s;mi&s;s her with contempt; but the more politic Mrs. Howard, who&s;e views were at once to de&s;troy Sophia's re|putation, and to &s;ecure her own, di&s;approved of this har&s;h treatment, as &s;he called it, and charitably re|&s;olved to ruin her with all po&s;&s;ible gentlene&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXX.</HI> Sophia leaves Mrs. Howard.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Howard accordingly wrote to Mrs. Gibbons, and acquainted her, that having di&s;co|vered an intrigue carrying on be|tween Sophia and her &s;on, &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mi&s;s her immediately out of her family; but that the poor young creature might be expo&s;ed as little as po&s;&s;ible to cen&s;ure, &s;he begged &s;he would come her&s;elf to fetch her away, and deli|ver her to her friends, with a cauti|on to watch her conduct carefully.</P>
<P>She recommended &s;ecrecy to her for Sophia's &s;ake; and a&s;&s;ured her that if it had not been for this di&s;|covery of her bad conduct, &s;he had re&s;olved to have provided for her hand&s;omely.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="137">Mrs. Gibbons, whom this letter threw into the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, immediately communicated the con|tents of it to Dolly and William, with whom &s;he now lived.</P>
<P>Dolly bur&s;t into tears of grief and indignation, and earne&s;tly in|treated her to go immediately and take Mi&s;s Sophia out of a hou&s;e where her merit was &s;o little under|&s;tood: but William, who looked farther into the con&s;equences of this affair than either his wife or his aunt, believed it nece&s;&s;ary for the ju&s;tification of Sophia's honour, that Mr. Law&s;on &s;hould wait upon Mrs. Howard, and demand an ex|planation of tho&s;e cen&s;ures which &s;he had ca&s;t upon a young lady con|fided to his care; rightly judging, that if malice was the &s;ource of her accu&s;ation, &s;he would not dare to pur&s;ue it with a man of his charac|ter; and if it aro&s;e from the infor|mation
<PB N="127" REF="138">
of others, he would be able to detect the fal&s;hood of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons prevailed with Mrs. Gibbons, who had been very de&s;irous to &s;hew her eloquence upon this occa&s;ion, and was re&s;olved, &s;he &s;aid, not to have &s;pared Mrs. Howard for her <HI>immature</HI> conclu|&s;ions.</P>
<P>William went immediately to his father-in-law, and acquainted him with what had happened. Mr. Law&s;on was grieved from the con&s;i|deration of what Sophia's delicate &s;en&s;ibility would feel from &s;uch an attack upon her reputation; and this was the wor&s;t that he apprehended could happen from calumnies which the purity of her manners and the innocency of her life would be al|ways a &s;ufficient refutation of. A wi&s;e and virtuous per&s;on, he knew, was out of the reach of fortune, though not free from the malice of it.
<PB N="128" REF="139">
All attempts again&s;t &s;uch a one are, as the poet &s;ays, like the arrows of Xerxes; they may darken the day, but cannot &s;tiflle the &s;un.</P>
<P>His impatience to take Sophia out of the hands of a woman whom he conceived to be either very ma|licious, or very imprudent, made him defer his vi&s;it no longer than till the afternoon.</P>
<P>When he &s;ent in his name, Mrs. Howard, who had no &s;u&s;picion of the occa&s;ion of his coming, ordered him to be &s;hewn into a parlour, where &s;he &s;uffered him to wait near an hour before &s;he admitted him to her pre|&s;ence; a country curate being in her opinion a per&s;on too in&s;ignificant to lay claim to any degree of con&s;ide|ration, and be&s;ides, this &s;ort of neglect being affected by many per|&s;ons of quality, to whom it certainly gives great importance and dignity,
<PB N="129" REF="140">
their imitators never lo&s;e any op|portunity of exerci&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on was at la&s;t &s;ummon|ed to the lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room, where he expected to have found Sophia, but was glad to &s;ee Mrs. Howard alone. She a&s;ked him with a little &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s, if he had any bu&s;ine&s;s with her; to which he replied, with a &s;olemnity in his look and accent that &s;urpri&s;ed her,
<Q>That being a friend to mi&s;s So|phia Darnley, and the per&s;on to who&s;e care &s;he was confided by her relations, he thought it his duty to enquire what part of her conduct had given occa&s;ion for tho&s;e unfavourable &s;u&s;picions which were entertained of her.</Q></P>
<P>"Mrs. Gibbons, madam," pur|&s;ued he,
<Q>has communicated to me a letter which &s;he has receiv|ed from you, wherein there is a heavy charge again&s;t mi&s;s Sophia;

I beg of you then, madam, let me know what foundation you have for believ|ing that Mi&s;s Sophia&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, whom this &s;peech had thrown into great confu&s;ion, interrupted him here, to prevent his repeating tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in her letter, the meaning of which, though obvious, &s;he dur&s;t not avow.</P>
<P>"I find," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>that you and Mrs. Gibbons have &s;een this
<PB N="131" REF="142">
affair in a wor&s;e light than I in|tended you &s;hould; my &s;on has been fooli&s;h enough to entertain a liking for this girl, whom I took under my protection, with a view to provide for her hand|&s;omely, and &s;he has been wi&s;e enough,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, with an ironical &s;mile,
<Q>to give him en|couragement, I &s;uppo&s;e; but with all her excellencies, I am not di&s;po&s;ed to make her my daugh|ter-in-law.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard threw in this la&s;t &s;oftening expre&s;&s;ion, in hopes it would &s;atisfy Mr. Law&s;on, and ad|ded,
<Q>that to prevent any thing happening, which might be di&s;|agreeable to her, &s;he begged he would take Sophia home with him.</Q></P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly, madam," &s;aid he;
<Q>but &s;ince it &s;eems to be your opinion, that this young gentle|woman
<PB N="132" REF="143">
woman has encouraged the clan|de&s;tine addre&s;&s;es of your &s;on, I think it will be proper to exa|mine fir&s;t into the truth of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, that you may not part with wor&s;e thoughts of her than &s;he de&s;erves.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard being thus pre&s;t, and unwilling to enter into an ex|planation that would expo&s;e all her artifices, was forced to acknow|ledge that &s;he had no other foun|dation for her fears than the pa&s;|&s;ion her &s;on had owned for her; and having made this unwilling conce&s;&s;ion, &s;he left him with a countenance inflamed with &s;tifled rage, &s;aying &s;he would &s;end Sophia to him.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he went into the room where &s;he was at work, and told her, her friend the curate was waiting to carry her home. Ob|&s;erving
<PB N="133" REF="144">
her to look extremely &s;ur|pri&s;ed, "If you con&s;ider," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>what returns you have made me for the benefits I have conferred upon you, you will not think it &s;trange that we &s;hould part in this manner.</Q></P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me," cried Sophia,
<Q>what have I done to de&s;erve &s;uch re|proaches?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I cannot &s;tay to talk to you now,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Howard;
<Q>I have explained my&s;elf to Mr. Law&s;on; I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that I now can only wi&s;h you well.</Q></P>
<P>She hurried out of the room when &s;he had &s;aid this; and So|phia, in the utmo&s;t perplexity and concern, flew down &s;tairs to Mr. Law&s;on, who was already at the gate waiting to help her into the chai&s;e: &s;he gave him her hand, a&s;k|ing
<PB N="134" REF="145">
him at the &s;ame time, with great emotion,
<Q>What Mrs. Howard accu&s;ed her of?</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as they drove away, Mr. Law&s;on related all that had pa&s;t between that lady and him, which filled Sophia with new a&s;toni&s;hment: &s;he could not com|prehend Mrs. Howard's motives for acting in the manner &s;he had done with regard to her; all her conduct appeared to her highly ex|travagant and incon&s;i&s;tent; &s;he a&s;ked Mr. Law&s;on a thou&s;and que&s;tions, full of that &s;implicity which ever accompanies real good|ne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>He gave her &s;ome notion of the dangerous character of Mrs. Howard, and greatly blamed her for having &s;o &s;uddenly accepted her invitation, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting Mr. Herbert. "It is a maxim, pur&s;ued he,
<Q>of one of the wi&s;e&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="146">
of the antients, that in form|ing new connections of every &s;ort, it is of great importance in what manner the fir&s;t ap|proaches are made, and by who&s;e hands the avenues of friend&s;hip are laid open.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on, by this hint, gave Sophia to under&s;tand, that he did not think Mrs. Gibbons a proper per&s;on to introduce her into the world. She was now &s;en&s;ible that &s;he had been too precipitate; but her motives were &s;o generous, that Mr. Herbert, whom in a let|ter &s;he acquainted with the whole affair, ea&s;ily ju&s;tified her in his own opinion, though he earne&s;tly recommended it to her not to let her apprehen&s;ions of being burthen|&s;ome to him draw her into new in|conveniencies.</P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on having, as he ima|gined, prevented Mrs. Howard
<PB N="136" REF="147">
from making any future attack upon Sophia's reputation, by obliging her to acknowledge her innocence, was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear wherever he went, of the calumnies &s;he invented again&s;t her.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than for per&s;ons to hate with extreme inveteracy tho&s;e whom they have injured; and although Mrs. How|ard was convinced, that Sophia would not admit a vi&s;it from her &s;on, (who now openly avowed his pa&s;&s;ion for her;) that &s;he refu&s;ed to receive his letters, and &s;hun|ned every place where &s;he thought it po&s;&s;ible to meet him; yet pre|tending to be apprehen&s;ive that the youth would be drawn into a clan|de&s;tine marriage, &s;he &s;ent him away precipitately upon his travels, and this gave a colour to new invectives again&s;t Sophia, who tru&s;ting only to her innocence for her ju&s;tification,
<PB N="137" REF="148">
had the &s;atisfaction to find that in|nocence fully acknowledged in the e&s;teem and re&s;pect with which &s;he was treated by all the per&s;ons of fa&s;hion in the neighbourhood.</P>

<P>Sophia, compo&s;ing her counte|nance as well as &s;he could, thanked Mrs. Gibbons for this in&s;tance of her friend&s;hip to her; but &s;he had no opportunity to ob&s;erve whether &s;he kept her word, for &s;he was &s;um|moned to town by a letter from her mother, which gave her a melan|choly account of her affairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley acquainted her that

the gentleman who paid her the an|nuity which Sir Charles had &s;tipu|lated for her when he procured him her late hu&s;band's place, was dead. She de&s;ired her to come immediately to town to a&s;&s;i&s;t her under her mi&s;|fortunes; and added in a po&s;t&s;cript, as if reluctantly, that Harriot had left her, and was not &s;o dutiful as &s;he could w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h.</P>
<P>Sophia read this letter with tears; and, impatient to comfort her af|flicted mother, &s;he in&s;tantly prepared for her little journey.</P>
<P>All Mr. Law&s;on's family parted from her with great regret; but Dolly's affliction was extreme, and Sophia amid&s;t &s;o many greater cau&s;es of &s;orrow, felt a new pang when &s;he took leave of her tender and in|nocent friend.</P>
<P>To &s;pare Mr. Law&s;on the trouble of conducting her to town, &s;he ac|cepted a place in the coach of a la|dy
<PB N="141" REF="152">
with whom &s;he had lately become acquainted, and who profe&s;&s;ed a particular e&s;teem for her.</P>
<P>On her arrival at her mother's hou&s;e, &s;he found only a &s;ervant there, who informed her that her mi&s;tre&s;s had taken lodgings at Ken&s;ington for the air, having been indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sophia ordered her to get a hack|ney coach to the door, and was hur|rying away without daring to en|quire for her &s;i&s;ter, when the maid told her mi&s;s Darnley de&s;ired to &s;ee her before &s;he went to Ken&s;ington.</P>
<P>"Where is my &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid So|phia, with a faultering accent.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer &s;he received was a &s;troke of fortune more cruel than any &s;he had yet experienced: her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he found, lived in the hou&s;e which Sir Charles had once offered to her.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXII</HI> Which leaves Sophia in her former Perplexity.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thought that &s;truck the amazed Sophia was, that Sir Charles, either following the motions of his natural incon&s;tancy, or in revenge of her &s;uppo&s;ed con|tempt of him, had married Harriot. Certain that &s;he had now lo&s;t for ever this lover, who with all his real or imputed faults, &s;he had never been able to bani&s;h from her heart, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf up to the &s;harp|e&s;t agonies of de&s;pair, and had al|ready arrived at her &s;i&s;ter's hou&s;e be|fore &s;he was able to &s;top the cour&s;e of her tears.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant in the livery of her own family opened the door. This cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="144" REF="155">
&s;urpri&s;ed Sophia, who pulling her hat over her eyes to con|ceal her di&s;order, a&s;ked him, with &s;ome he&s;itation, if his mi&s;tre&s;s was at home.</P>
<P>The fellow replied, he believed &s;he was, and opening the coach-door, &s;hewed her into a parlour, telling her, with a &s;mart air, that he would enquire of his lady's wo|man whether &s;he was vi&s;ible yet or no.</P>
<P>Sophia having &s;ummoned all her fortitude to enable her to go through this &s;evere trial with dignity, had time enough to recollect and com|po&s;e her&s;elf before any one appeared; and now &s;everal circum&s;tances ru&s;h|ed upon her memory which, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of her a&s;toni&s;hment and grief, had e&s;caped her attention.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, in her letter, had not mentioned Harriot's marriage, but barely &s;aid &s;he had left her. The
<PB N="145" REF="156">
&s;ervant who delivered her me&s;&s;age called her mi&s;s Darnley; and though &s;he lived in a hou&s;e that belonged to Sir Charles, yet it was &s;carcely &s;uit|able to the quality of his wife.</P>
<P>A few moments reflection upon the&s;e appearances made the generous Sophia change the object of her con|cern. The misfortune for which &s;he had grieved &s;o much, &s;eemed light, compared with that &s;he appre|hended: &s;he wept no longer for the incon&s;tancy of her lover; &s;he trem|bled for the honour of her &s;i&s;ter-; and her greate&s;t fear now was, that Sir Charles was not married.</P>
<P>While &s;he was ab&s;orbed in the&s;e melancholy thoughts, Harriot's maid entered the room, who after glanc|ing over Sophia with a &s;upercilious eye, (for &s;he was very &s;imply dre&s;t,) a&s;ked her,
<Q>If &s;he had any bu&s;ine&s;s with her lady.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tell her, replied Sophia, that her &s;i&s;ter is here.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="157">The girl blu&s;hed, courte&s;ied, and flew to acquaint her mi&s;tre&s;s; and Sophia was in&s;tantly de&s;ired to walk up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>She found Harriot in her dre&s;&s;ing room, in an elegant di&s;habille, having ju&s;t fini&s;hed her morning's work, which appeared in a &s;uit of ribbons made up with great ta&s;te.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw Sophia, &s;he ro&s;e from her chair, and &s;aluted her with affected dignity; but at the &s;ame time with an air of embarra&s;&s;|ment that encrea&s;ed every moment: &s;o that being unable to bear the &s;weet but penetrating looks of her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he re&s;umed her work, alter|ing and unripping, without any ap|parent de&s;ign, yet affecting to be extremely bu&s;y, and to &s;hew how perfectly &s;he was at ea&s;e, talked of the mo&s;t trifling matters imaginable, while Sophia gazed on her in &s;ilent angui&s;h, anxious to know the truth
<PB N="147" REF="158">
of her &s;ituation, yet dreading to have it explained. At length &s;he told her that &s;he was going to Ken|&s;ington to her mother, and de&s;ired to know if &s;he had any me&s;&s;age to &s;end to her.</P>
<P>Harriot &s;uddenly interrupting her, as if &s;he feared &s;ome further que&s;ti|ons, began to exclaim again&s;t her mother's unrea&s;onable temper, &s;ay|ing, that &s;he had offended her vio|lently only becau&s;e &s;he had it not in her power to comply with &s;ome very extravagant expectations which &s;he had formed.</P>
<P><Q>Si&s;ter, &s;aid Sophia, I am wholly ignorant of your affairs; I know not what cau&s;e of di&s;content you have given my mother, but I &s;ee there is a great alteration in your condition of life, and I hope&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>What do you hope, pray Mi&s;s? interrupted Harriot, reddening: I &s;uppo&s;e I am to have &s;ome of your
<PB N="148" REF="159">
&s;atirical flings; your temper is not altered I find.</Q></P>
<P>"Dear Harriot," re&s;umed Sophia, with tears in her eyes (this cau&s;ele&s;s anger confirming her &s;u&s;picions)
<Q>why do you reproach me with be|ing &s;atirical? is it a crime to be anxious for your happine&s;s?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I wi&s;h you would not trouble your&s;elf about me, replied Harri|ot, I know be&s;t what will make me happy; you &s;hould not pre|tend to in&s;truct your elders, mi&s;s Sophy; I am older than you; you know, you have often up|braided me with that.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Si&s;ter, &s;aid Sophia calmly, you de&s;ired to &s;ee me, have you any thing to &s;ay to me?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know, an&s;wered Harriot, that I &s;hall meet with ungrateful returns for my kindne&s;s; never|thele&s;s I &s;hall act like a &s;i&s;ter to|wards you, and it was to tell you
<PB N="149" REF="160">
&s;o that I wi&s;hed to &s;ee you: I very much doubt whether, if you were in pro&s;perity, you would do the &s;ame by me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Have I behaved &s;o ill in adver|&s;ity then, &s;aid Sophia, that you form this hard judgment of me, Harriot?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray don't upbraid me with your behaviour, mi&s;s, &s;aid Har|riot; other people may have be|haved as well as you, though they are not prudes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;ay you are in pro&s;perity, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid Sophia, but perhaps you and I have different notions of pro&s;perity: let me know the truth of your &s;ituation, and if I find you happy according to my notions of happine&s;s, you will &s;oon be convinced that I can take a &s;i&s;ter's &s;hare in it.</Q></P>
<P>"I am not obliged to give an "account of my conduct to you,
<PB N="150" REF="161">
replied Harriot, who had li&s;ten|ed to this &s;peech with great emo|tion;
<Q>and I mu&s;t tell you, &s;i&s;ter Sophia, that if you go on taking this liberty of que&s;tioning and cen&s;uring me, I &s;hall not care how &s;eldom I &s;ee you. As to my mother, I know that it is my du|ty to do every thing for her that is in my power; and this I have offered to do already.</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he rang the bell, and her maid appearing, &s;he gave her &s;ome orders which nece&s;&s;arily re|quired her attendance in the room; &s;o that Sophia, finding &s;he could have no further di&s;cour&s;e with her &s;i&s;ter, ro&s;e up and took leave of her with an aching heart. Her griefs all aggravated by the apprehen&s;ion of her &s;i&s;ter's di&s;honour, and the ha|tred which &s;he felt for Sir Charles, as her &s;educer, &s;truggling with a ten|der remembrance, her gentle bo&s;om

<P>Sophia &s;aw her pale and emaci|ated, and was greatly affected with the &s;ight: &s;he would not mention her &s;i&s;ter, for fear of di&s;compo&s;ing her; but Mrs. Darnley &s;oon intro|duced the &s;ubject that was mo&s;t in her thoughts, and exclaimed again&s;t Harriot's undutifulne&s;s and want of affection with the mo&s;t violent tran&s;|ports of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="164">
<Q>I have been the be&s;t of mo|thers to her,</Q>

<Q>I have always indul|ged her in all her wi&s;hes, and impaired my fortune to &s;upport her extravagancies, and how has &s;he returned this kindne&s;s! Would you think it, my dear Sophy, though &s;he is in affluent circum|&s;tances, and I, by the lo&s;s of my annuity, am plunged into all my former di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he has re|fu&s;ed to pay tho&s;e debts which I contracted during the time &s;he lived with me; and thinks it &s;uf|ficient to invite me to re&s;ide in her hou&s;e, where, no doubt, I &s;hould feel my dependence &s;e|verely.</Q></P>
<P>"Sir Charles," &s;aid Sophia &s;igh|ing,

<P><PB N="154" REF="165">"Married your &s;i&s;ter!" repeated Mrs. Darnley, in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>

<P>"Oh," re&s;umed Mrs. Darnley,
<Q>I perceive your mi&s;take; but that hou&s;e is not Sir Charles's now; Lord L&mdash; bought it of him, with the furniture, &s;ome time ago; it might have been yours, and without any offence to your virtue too&punc; yet you thought fit to refu&s;e it: but I will not pretend to reprove one &s;o much wi&s;er than my&s;elf&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"Well, madam," interrupted So|phia eagerly,
<Q>then it is not to Sir

<P><Q>You have &s;een her, have you not?</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Darnley, looking a little confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I have indeed &s;een her," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>but &s;he did not explain her &s;ituation to me.</Q></P>
<P>"And do you imagine," re|&s;umed Mrs. Darnley, peevi&s;hly,
<Q>that &s;he would be le&s;s re&s;erved with her mother? and if &s;he was afraid of telling you the truth, is it likely &s;he would own it to me?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then I fear it is bad indeed with Harriot,</Q>
cried Sophia, in a melancholy accent,
<Q>&s;ince &s;he has &s;o much to conceal from a mother and a &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You were always cen&s;orious, Sophy,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Darnley, with &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion;
<Q>for my part, I am re&s;olved to think the be&s;t.
<PB N="156" REF="167">
If Lord L&mdash;is married pri|vately to your &s;i&s;ter, her charac|ter will one day be cleared to the world, and &s;he thinks no pru|dent per&s;on can blame her, for chu&s;ing to bear for a time a few unde&s;erved cen&s;ures, rather than to &s;truggle with poverty and con|tempt.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Reproach me no more with my tenderne&s;s for your &s;i&s;ter,</Q>

<Q>I am too much affected with her ingratitude already.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;orry &s;he is ungrateful," &s;aid Sophia;
<Q>but, oh! my dear mamma, it is not fit you &s;hould accept of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope," &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, ca&s;ting down her eyes,
<Q>that I know what to do as well as my daughter.&mdash;But Sophy,</Q>
added &s;he, after a little pau&s;e,
<Q>I am &s;orry to tell you, if you do not know it already, that if you have &s;till any thought of Sir Charles, you deceive your&s;elf; I am very well informed, that a match has been propo&s;ed to him, and he has given &s;o favourable an an&s;wer
<PB N="158" REF="169">
that it is expected the marriage will be concluded, as &s;oon as he comes from Paris: I heard it all from one of the young lady's relations.</Q></P>
<P>This was a &s;evere &s;troke to poor Sophia, who had ju&s;t begun to breathe again, after the angui&s;h &s;he had &s;uffered, in the belief that Sir Charles had for&s;aken her for her &s;i&s;ter, and added perfidy and ba&s;ene&s;s to his incon&s;tancy.</P>

<P>Sophia, more &s;oftened by this tenderne&s;s, &s;uffered her tears to flow a few moments unre&s;trained; then &s;uddenly wiping her charm|ing eyes,
<Q>Pardon this weakne&s;s,

<P><Q>Aye, I have &s;orrows enough, Heaven knows,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Darn|ley,
<Q>my debts unpaid, my annuity gone, what have I to tru&s;t to?</Q></P>
<P>"Providence," interrupted So|phia,
<Q>your piety and my indu&s;try. Alas! my dear mamma, your greate&s;t affliction is not the lo&s;s of your annuity, or the debts with which you are encumbered, it is my &s;i&s;ter's unhappy fall from virtue. That parent,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>who &s;ees a beloved child become a prey to licentious pa&s;|&s;ions, who &s;ees her publicly in|cur &s;hame and reproach, expel|led the &s;ociety of the good and virtuous, and lead a life of di&s;|honour embittered with the con|tempt
<PB N="106" REF="171">
of the world, and the &s;e|cret upbraidings of her own con|&s;cience; that parent can be&s;t judge of your angui&s;h now: I have only a &s;i&s;ter's feelings for this misfortune! but the&s;e feelings are &s;trong enough to make me very unhappy.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley appeared &s;o much moved with this di&s;cour&s;e, that So|phia pur&s;ued it, till &s;he brought her mother to declare, that &s;he would rather &s;uffer all the inconve|niencies of poverty, than give a &s;anc|tion to Harriot's guilt, by partaking of its reward.</P>
<P>Sophia, to relieve her anxiety, laid down a plan for their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and proved to her, that by her &s;kill in &s;everal little u&s;eful arts, it would be ea&s;y for her to &s;upply her with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life.

<P>"The furniture of your hou&s;e," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>the plate, and other pieces of finery, which Sir Charles Stanley pre&s;ented to you, will, if converted into money, not only pay your debts, but provide a little fund for pre&s;ent expences, and a re&s;erve for future exigencies; mean while, my in|du&s;try and care will, I hope, keep want far from you. I have friends, who will find employ|ment for my little talents; and if I can but make your life ea&s;y and comfortable, I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, with tears in her eyes, embraced her daughter, bid her di&s;po&s;e of every thing as &s;he

plea&s;ed, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would endeavour to bear her new condition of life with patience and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Sophia immediately wrote to a gentleman of the law, who had been an intimate friend of her father's; and he undertook to manage their little affairs in town. A few days afterwards he brought them a hundred pounds, which was all that remained from the &s;ale, after every demand upon Mrs. Darnley was paid.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXIV.</HI> Sophia continues to act romanticly, and Harriot like a Woman who knows the World.</HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA, who thought her mother's declining health a bet|ter rea&s;on for not re&s;iding in Lon|don, hired in an adjacent village, at a very &s;mall rent, a little hou&s;e, or rather cottage, &s;o neat, and &s;itu|ated &s;o happily, that an imaginati|on lively as hers was, and a little romantick, could not fail of being charmed with it. To this place &s;he removed her books, and being provided by her friend Dolly with an innocent country girl for a &s;er|vant, &s;he conducted her mother to her rural abode, and had the &s;atis|faction to find her plea&s;ed with it, novelty having always charms for
<PB N="165" REF="176">
her, and here for a few days, it &s;upplied the place of tho&s;e other gratifications to which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e cares, So|phia did not forget her unhappy &s;i&s;|ter: &s;he wrote &s;everal letters to her, in which &s;he employed all the power of virtuous eloquence to bring her to a &s;en&s;e of her errors, but in vain.</P>
<P>Harriot did not deign to an&s;wer her, but in a letter to her mother, &s;he complained of the injurious treatment &s;he received from Sophia, and earne&s;tly intreated her to leave her &s;i&s;ter, and re&s;ide with her.</P>
<P>Although Mrs. Darnley refu&s;ed this offer with &s;eeming &s;teadine&s;s, yet her di&s;content was but too apparent. A life of retirement, which often obliged her to &s;eek in her&s;elf, tho&s;e re&s;ources again&s;t lan|guor
<PB N="166" REF="177">
and melancholy, which &s;he u&s;ed to find in the di&s;&s;ipations of the town, could not be grateful to one who had never accu&s;tomed her|&s;elf to reflection, who&s;e mind was filled with trifles, and its whole &s;tock of ideas derived from dre&s;s, cards, and every other fa&s;hionable folly.</P>
<P>To be capable of enjoying a ru|ral life, there is &s;omething more nece&s;&s;ary than a good under&s;tand|ing: innocence and purity of man|ners mu&s;t contribute to give a re|li&s;h to plea&s;ures, which are found|ed in rea&s;on, virtue, and piety.</P>
<P>Hence it was, that Sophia, in the bloom of youth, found happine&s;s in the &s;olitude of a village, while her mother, in a declining age, panted after the vanities of the town.</P>
<P>In vain did Mr. Herbert fill the letters he wrote to Mrs. Darnley, with maxims of morality and pious
<PB N="167" REF="178">
admonitions; he experienced here the truth of that ob&s;ervation, that it is a work of great difficulty to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s vice from a heart, where long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;eems to plead pre|&s;cription.</P>
<P>Sophia, who knew her mother's ta&s;te for living at ea&s;e, that &s;he might be able to gratify it, applied her&s;elf diligently to her work, which was a piece of embroidery, that had been be&s;poke by a benevolent lady, in order to give her pre&s;ent employment; and, by exhibiting it as a proof of her ingenuity, to pro|cure her more. She likewi&s;e exer|ci&s;ed her invention in drawing little de&s;igns for fan-mounts; and always cho&s;e &s;uch &s;ubjects as conveyed &s;ome moral le&s;&s;on to the mind, while they plea&s;ed the imagination.</P>

encouraged to pur&s;ue her labour; and Mrs. Darnley, flattered by the pro&s;pect of more ea&s;y circum&s;tances, began to enlarge her &s;cheme of ex|pence, made little excur&s;ions about the country in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, talked of hiring a better hou&s;e, and of pa&s;&s;ing two months at lea&s;t in Lon|don during the winter.</P>
<P>Mean time Harriot became more earne&s;t in &s;olicitations to her mother, to come and live with her; her &s;i|tuation began to be &s;o generally &s;u&s;pected, that &s;he was in danger of being wholly neglected.</P>
<P>She wrote to her in a &s;train of tenderne&s;s and duty, that revived all the ill-judging parent's affection, who invited her to make her a vi&s;it in her little retreat, and promi&s;ed her a favourable reception even from Sophia her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sophia was indeed far from op|po&s;ing this vi&s;it; &s;he was rather de&s;i|rous
<PB N="169" REF="180">
of drawing her &s;i&s;ter thither frequently, with a hope that her example and her arguments might one day influence her to change her conduct.</P>
<P>Harriot received this invitation with joy; for &s;uch was the depra|vity of her mind, that &s;he exulted in having an opportunity of di&s;|playing the grandeur of her dre&s;s, and equipage to her &s;i&s;ter; to her who had made virtuous poverty her choice, and &s;hewn that &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed riches, when they were to be pur|cha&s;ed by guilt. <HI>The pride of hu|man nature</HI> (&s;ays an eminent writer) <HI>takes its ri&s;e from its corruption, as worms are produced by putrefac|tion.</HI></P>
<P>The wretched fallen Harriot was proud! the diamonds that glittered in her hair, the gilt chariot, and the luxurious table; the&s;e monuments of her di&s;grace contributed to keep

up the in&s;olence of a woman, who by the lo&s;s of her honour was lower than the meane&s;t of her &s;ervants, who could boa&s;t of an uncorrupted virtue.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXV.</HI> Harriot vi&s;its her mother in her Cottage.</HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA was bu&s;ily employed upon her embroidery, when Harriot, from her gay chariot, alighted at her door; &s;he entered that humble abode of innocence and indu&s;try, in a kind of triumph, and acco&s;ted her &s;i&s;ter with a haughty expre&s;&s;ion of &s;uperiority in her looks and air, as if &s;he expected the &s;plendor of her appearance &s;hould &s;trike her with awe.</P>
<P>Sophia received her with the mode&s;t dignity of con&s;cious virtue; and Harriot, tho' incapable of much reflection, yet &s;oon perceiv|ed the mi&s;erable figure &s;he made, in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a charac|ter, and &s;tood &s;ilent and aba&s;hed,
<PB N="172" REF="183">
while Sophia contemplated her finery with an eye of pity and of angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Harriot, at length recovering her&s;elf, a&s;ked for her mother, who that moment entered the room. The &s;ight of her daughter's equi|page, had thrown her into an a|greeable flutter of &s;pirits, and &s;he readily pardoned the fine lady, all the faults of the ungrateful child.</P>
<P>Harriot, emboldened by &s;o kind a reception, propo&s;ed to her to ac|company her to town, promi&s;ing to make her abode with her a|greeable, by every in&s;tance of duty and affection.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley blu&s;hed, and was &s;ilent. Sophia fixed her eyes upon her mother, anxious and impatient for her an&s;wer; &s;he ca&s;t a timid glance at Sophia: &s;he read in her &s;peaking eyes her &s;entiments of this propo&s;al; and turning to Har|riot,
<PB N="173" REF="184">
&s;he told her faintly, that not being &s;atisfied with her conduct, it would be very improper for her to countenance it, by re&s;iding with her.</P>
<P>Harriot bur&s;t into tears, and ex|claimed again&s;t her &s;i&s;ter's malice, who, &s;he &s;aid, acted like her mo&s;t cruel enemy, and &s;ought to ruin her character, by e&s;tranging her&s;elf from her company, and preventing her mother from taking notice of her.</P>
<P>Sophia, with great gentlene&s;s, proved to her, that the lo&s;s of her reputation was the nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of her living in a manner un&s;uitable to her circum&s;tances; that her mother and her, by com|plying with her reque&s;t, could not pre&s;erve her from cen&s;ure, but would incur it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"You call me cruel, Harriot," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>for e&s;tranging my&s;elf from your company; but con&s;i|der
<PB N="174" REF="185">
a little, whether it is not you that are both cruel and un|ju&s;t. Why would you deprive me of the only reward the world be&s;tows on me, for a life of vo|luntary poverty; you have ex|changed a good name for dre&s;s and equipage; and I, to pre&s;erve one, &s;ubject my&s;elf to labour and indigence: you enjoy your pur|cha&s;e; but I &s;hould lo&s;e mine, were I to have that complai&s;ance for you which you require. Leave me my reputation then, &s;ince it is the &s;ole recompence of tho&s;e hard&s;hips to which I wil|lingly &s;ubmit; and if you wi&s;h to recover yours, be contented to be poor like me.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, finding her &s;i&s;ter li&s;tened to her, tho' it was &s;ullenly, and with down-ca&s;t eyes, expatiated in a tender manner upon the errors of her conduct, and the fatal con|&s;equences
<PB N="175" REF="186">
that were likely to fol|low.</P>
<P>Harriot at length interrupted her, with a pert air, and &s;aid,
<Q>She would not be taught her duty by her younger &s;i&s;ter;</Q>
then turning to her mother,
<Q>I hope, madam,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>my &s;i&s;ter will not have &s;o much power with you, as to make you forbid my coming here.</Q></P>
<P>She put her handkerchief to her eyes, as &s;he &s;aid this; to which Mrs. Darnley replied, with great vehemence,
<Q>That no per&s;on on earth &s;hould ever prevail upon her to ca&s;t off her child.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia was &s;ilent, and ob&s;erving that her pre&s;ence &s;eemed to lay them under &s;ome re&s;traint, &s;he ro&s;e up, to retire to her work, telling her &s;i&s;ter, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by her "That far from hindering "her vi&s;its, &s;he would rather en|courage
<PB N="176" REF="187">
her to repeat them often,
<Q>that &s;he might be convinced it was po&s;&s;ible, to be happy in a cottage.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot laughed, and muttered the words romantick and affecta|tion, which Sophia took no no|tice of, but left her at liberty to conver&s;e freely with her mother.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley talked to her at fir&s;t in a chiding &s;train, and af|fected to a&s;&s;ume the authority of a parent; but, a &s;lave to her appe|tites, &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t any op|portunity of gratifying them; and Harriot found it no difficult mat|ter to force a pre&s;ent upon her, to &s;upply tho&s;e expences which her extravagance, and not her wants, made nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Harriot now came often to the village, and gave it out, that &s;he was upon the be&s;t terms imagina|ble with her mother and &s;i&s;ter, not
<PB N="177" REF="188">
doubting but the world would cea&s;e to &s;u&s;pect her, &s;ince Sophia approv|ed her conduct.</P>
<P>The frequency and the length of her vi&s;its made Sophia entertain hopes of her reformation, &s;ince the time &s;he &s;pent with her mo|ther, was taken from that dan|gerous and immoral di&s;&s;ipation, which forms the circle of what is called a gay life. For it is with our manners as with our health; the abatement of vice is a degree of virtue, the abatement of di&s;ea&s;e is a degree of health.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert being perfectly re|covered, filled Sophia with extreme joy, by the account he &s;ent her of it, and of his re&s;olution to come and live near her.</P>
<P>While &s;he impatiently expected his arrival, and &s;ent many a long|ing look towards the road, near which her little cottage was &s;i|tuated,
<PB N="178" REF="189">
&s;he one day &s;aw a gentle|man ride by full &s;peed, who in his per&s;on and air had a great re&s;em|blance to Sir Charles Stanley. Her heart, by its throbbing emotion, &s;eemed to acknowledge its con|queror; for poor Sophia was &s;till in love: &s;he loved, though &s;he de&s;paired of ever being happy; and by thus per&s;i&s;ting in a hopele&s;s pa&s;|&s;ion, contradicted that maxim, that love, like fire, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out continual motion, and cea&s;es to be as &s;oon as it cea&s;es to hope or fear.</P>
<P>Sophia, not able to remove her eyes from the place where &s;he fan|cied &s;he had &s;een Sir Charles, con|tinued to look fixedly towards the road, and was beginning to believe &s;he had been mi&s;taken, when a &s;er|vant in Sir Charles's livery rode by al&s;o, and put it out of doubt that &s;he had really &s;een the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="190">This unexpected incident a|wakened a thou&s;and tender melan|choly ideas in her mind; and find|ing her&s;elf too much &s;oftened, &s;he had recour&s;e again to her work, to divert her imagination from an object, &s;he had vainly endeavoured to forget.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXVI.</HI> Sir Charles appears again upon the Scene.</HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA was not deceived when &s;he imagined &s;he had &s;een Sir Charles; it was really he who had rode by her window, and it was her little abode he was in &s;earch of, though in his extream eagerne&s;s he had overlooked it.</P>
<P>He had left England with a hope that change of &s;cene, and a variety of new objects, would efface the idea of Sophia from his heart, and re&s;tore him to his former tranquility; but amid&s;t all the delights of Paris he found him&s;elf oppre&s;t with langour: no amu&s;ements could entertain him, no conver&s;ation engage his attention; di&s;gu&s;ted with every thing he &s;aw
<PB N="181" REF="192">
and heard, peevi&s;h, di&s;contented, and weary of the world, he avoided all company, and had recour&s;e to books for relief; but Sophia was too much in his thoughts to render &s;tudy either in&s;tructive or amu&s;ing. He pa&s;t whole days in &s;olitude, feeding his melancholy with the reflection of a thou&s;and pa&s;t circum&s;tances which &s;erved to &s;often his mind, and make him feel his lo&s;s more &s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>When he reflected on her exalted virtues, her wit, her elegance, the attractive graces of her per&s;on, and the irre&s;i&s;table &s;weetne&s;s of her man|ners, he lamented his hard fate that had put &s;uch a trea&s;ure out of his reach; but when his con&s;cience told him that it had once been in his power to have become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of this trea&s;ure, that he had trifled with that innocent affection till he had alienated it from him&s;elf to another
<PB N="182" REF="193">
object; his angui&s;h became in&s;up|portable, and he &s;ought to relieve it by rou&s;ing his indignation again&s;t her, for her preference of &s;o unwor|thy a rival.</P>
<P>He called to mind her interview with this happy rival in the field, and concluded he was far more fa|voured by her than him&s;elf had ever been, &s;ince her di&s;cour&s;e to him had produced &s;o tender and pa&s;&s;ionate an expre&s;&s;ion of acknowledgment as that the had beheld.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, which his imagination dwelt upon in order to le&s;&s;en his regret, added to it all the &s;tings of jealou&s;y; &s;o that, almo&s;t frantic with rage and grief, he was a hundred times upon the point of committing &s;ome de&s;perate action.</P>
<P>A violent fever was the con&s;e|quence of the&s;e tran&s;ports, which, after confining him a long time to his bed, left his body in a weak and
<PB N="183" REF="194">
langui&s;hing condition, and his mind &s;unk in an habitual melancholy.</P>
<P>His phy&s;icians recommended to him the air of Montpelier, and he was preparing to &s;et out for that place when he happened to meet with a gentleman who made him al|ter his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>This per&s;on had been his gover|nor, and now attended Mr. Howard in the &s;ame quality.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, who had a flight ac|quaintance with Mrs. Howard, was prevailed upon, nowith&s;tanding his aver&s;ion to company, to receive a vi&s;it from her &s;on: he invited the young gentleman to dine with him, and he having not yet forgot the lovely Sophia, drank her health after dinner by the name of mi&s;s Darnley.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, who could not hear that name without a vi&s;ible emotion, told him he knew two young ladies &s;o called, and a&s;ked whether it was
<PB N="184" REF="195">
the elde&s;t or the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter that he meant?</P>
<P>Mr. Howard replied,
<Q>That he was ignorant till then that mi&s;s Darnley had a &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yes &s;he has a &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid his governor, who is much hand|&s;omer than her&s;elf, and for whom a youthful pa&s;&s;ion would be thought perhaps more excu&s;a|ble.</Q></P>
<P>The young gentleman, who knew his governor talked in that contemp|tuous manner of Sophia in com|pliance with his mother's humour, in revenge avowed his admiration of her in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate terms, and forgetting that Sir Charles had &s;aid he was acquainted with her, de&s;|cribed her excellencies with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a lover.</P>
<P>Sir Charles li&s;tened in &s;ilence; and when the other had done &s;peaking told him, with an air of forced gai|ty,
<PB N="185" REF="196">
that it was ea&s;y to &s;ee he was very much in love.</P>
<P>This, indeed, was his real opi|nion; neverthele&s;s, he felt no emo|tions of jealou&s;y or re&s;entment again&s;t a rival whom he believed as unhappy as him&s;elf; he a&s;ked him with a &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s if mi&s;s Sophia was not to be mar|ried to the &s;on of a rich farmer in the village where &s;he lived? and waited his an&s;wer with an agi|tation of mind which appeared &s;o plainly in the frequent changes of his colour, that Mr. Howard mu&s;t have ob&s;erved it, had not the que&s;tion given him almo&s;t as much concern.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort pau&s;e he replied,
<Q>That he never heard &s;he was go|ing to be married;</Q>
but, added he, &s;ighing,
<Q>I remember I have &s;een a very hand&s;ome young man

<P><Q>Aye, aye, interrupted his go|vernor, &s;miling, he was the fa|voured lover no doubt, you have nothing to do but to forget her as &s;oon as you can.</Q></P>
<P>The youth &s;at pen&s;ive and &s;ilent for &s;ome time, then &s;uddenly ri&s;ing, took leave of Sir Charles and went away; his governor prepared to fol|low him, but the baronet, anxious to hear more of Sophia, detained him to ask &s;everal que&s;tions concern|ing her acquaintance with Mr. Howard.</P>

<P>SIR Charles found his old friend had lo&s;t no part of his former candor and &s;incerity: though by the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him he was obliged to di&s;countenance as much as po&s;&s;ible the pa&s;&s;ion of his pupil for a young woman &s;o much his in|ferior in rank and fortune; yet hav|ing &s;een and conver&s;ed with Sophia, he did ju&s;tice to her extraordinary merit, and acknowledged that Mrs. Howard had treated her har&s;hly.</P>
<P>He related to Sir Charles in what manner Mrs. Howard had invited her to her hou&s;e, and the &s;u&s;picions &s;he entertained of Sophia's encou|raging her &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ign to en&s;nare him into a clande&s;tine
<PB N="188" REF="199">
marriage. "Su&s;picions," added he,
<Q>which her &s;ub&s;equent behaviour entirely de&s;troyed, for the youth was ra&s;h enough to avow his pa&s;|&s;ion openly, and &s;ollicited her by frequent letters and me&s;&s;ages to grant him an interview, which &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, and this conduct did her honour and procured her great e&s;teem; yet it is very likely that her affections are otherwi&s;e engaged, and that &s;he has &s;ome difficulties to en|counter, for &s;he looks thought|ful and melancholy, and affects retirement more than per&s;ons of her age generally do.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles was thrown into &s;o profound a reverie by this account of Sophia, that he heard not a word of what his friend afterwards &s;aid which had no relation to this inte|re&s;ting &s;ubject, and &s;carce perceived when he went away.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="200">After reflecting a long time with mingled grief, re&s;entment, and compa&s;&s;ion, upon her melan|choly, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome di&s;appointment in the affair of her marriage with the young farmer, and which probably her want of fortune was the cau&s;e of, he &s;uddenly formed the gene|rous de&s;ign of removing this ob&s;tacle to her union with the per&s;on whom &s;he preferred to him, and, by making her happy, entitle him&s;elf to her e&s;teem, &s;ince he had unfortunately lo&s;t her heart.</P>
<P>The novelty of this re&s;olution and its extraordinary genero&s;ity, filled him with &s;o many &s;elf-flatter|ing ideas, as &s;u&s;pended for a while his jealou&s;y and his grief.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of going to Montpelier he &s;et out immediately for England, and during his journey was continually applauding him&s;elf for the uncom|mon
<PB N="190" REF="201">
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his con|duct.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that the motives even of our be&s;t actions will not always bear exami|nation; we deceive our&s;elves fir&s;t, and our vanity is too much intere&s;t|ed in the deception, to make us wi&s;h to detect it. Sir Charles ei|ther did not or would not perceive the latent hope that lurked within his bo&s;om, and which, perhaps, &s;ugge&s;ted the de&s;igns he had formed.</P>
<P>How mu&s;t &s;uch an in&s;tance of generous pa&s;&s;ion, thought he, af|fect a mind &s;o delicately &s;en&s;ible as Sophia's! &s;he who had once loved him, and what was more than pro|bable had not yet entirely forgot him.</P>
<P>He never a&s;ked him&s;elf, why his imagination dwelt upon the&s;e plea&s;|ing images? why he pro&s;ecuted
<PB N="191" REF="202">
his journey with &s;uch eager ha&s;te, as if the purport of it was to receive, not to re&s;ign for ever the woman he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved?</P>
<P>When he arrived at his own hou&s;e &s;carce would he allow him&s;elf a few minutes re&s;t after his fatiguing journey: he ha&s;tened to Mr. Her|bert's lodgings, to prevail upon him to ju&s;tify by his concurrence the de|&s;igns he had formed in favour of Sophia.</P>
<P>Mean time the &s;ecret and power|ful impul&s;e by which he was ac|tuated, kept his mind in a continu|al tumult. He hoped, he feared, he wi&s;hed: he was all anxious expectation, all trembling doubt; he heard with grief that Mr. Her|bert was at Bath; for now he knew not how to get acce&s;s to Sophia, who being ignorant of his intentions,
<PB N="192" REF="203">
and offended by his behaviour, might po&s;&s;ibly refu&s;e to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>He went to the hou&s;e where Mrs. Darnley lived when he left England; he was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it &s;hut up. This incident perplexed him more, and rendered him more impatient.</P>
<P>He returned to his hou&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night, and early in the morning ordering his hor&s;es to be &s;addled, &s;et out immediately for Mr. Law&s;on's; where he arrived before he had re&s;olved how to intro|duce him&s;elf, or who he &s;hould en|quire for.</P>
<P>However, upon the appearance of a &s;ervant at the door, he a&s;ked for Mr. Herbert; which Mr. Law|&s;on hearing, came out him&s;elf, and, though he did not know Sir Charles, politely reque&s;ted him to alight, telling him, he had ju&s;t received a letter

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HI> Sir Charles has an interview with Mr. Law&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Charles accepted Mr. Law|&s;on's invitation, and alighting, followed him into a parlour, but in &s;uch perturbation of mind that he &s;carce knew what he did. The good curate, &s;urpri&s;ed at the pen|&s;ivene&s;s and &s;ilence of his gue&s;t, knew not what to &s;ay to him, or how to entertain him: he gave him an account of Mr. Herbert's illne&s;s, which &s;eemed to engage his atten|tion very little; but happening to mention Sophia in the cour&s;e of his relation, the young baronet &s;tarted as from a dream, and turned his eyes upon him with a look of eager|ne&s;s and anxiety, but &s;aid not a word.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="206">Mr. Law&s;on pau&s;ed, as expecting he was going to a&s;k him a que&s;tion, which Sir Charles perceiving, &s;aid with &s;ome confu&s;ion,
<Q>I beg your pardon, Sir, you mentioned mi&s;s Sophia, I have the honour to know her, pray how does &s;he do?</Q></P>
<P>"I hope &s;he is well, Sir," repli|ed Mr. Law&s;on,
<Q>I have not &s;een her a long time.</Q></P>
<P>"Then &s;he does not re&s;ide with you now," &s;aid Sir Charles, with a coun|tenance as pale as death, dreading to hear &s;omething &s;till more fatal.</P>
<P>As Mr. Law&s;on was going to an|&s;wer him, William, not knowing his father-in-law had company, en|tered the room abruptly; but &s;eeing the baronet, he bowed, apologized for his intru&s;ion, and in&s;tantly re|tired.</P>
<P>The various emotions with which
<PB N="196" REF="207">
this &s;udden and unexpected &s;ight of his rival filled the brea&s;t of Sir Charles, cau&s;ed &s;uch a wildne&s;s in his looks, that Mr. Law&s;on, in great a&s;toni&s;hment and perplexity a&s;ked him if he was taken ill?</P>
<P>Sir Charles endeavouring to com|po&s;e him&s;elf, replied,
<Q>That he was very well,</Q>
but in a faultering accent a&s;ked, who the young gen|tleman was that had ju&s;t left the room.</P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on told him he was his &s;on-in-law.</P>
<P>"Your &s;on-in-law!" cried Sir Charles, eagerly,
<Q>what! mar|ried to your daughter! is it po&s;|&s;ible?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on knew enough of So|phia's &s;tory to make him compre|hend now who this young gentle|man was, who di&s;covered &s;o extra|ordinary a concern upon this occa|&s;ion:
<PB N="197" REF="208">
and, charmed to have an op|portunity of doing her &s;ervice by removing tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions which he had been told had produced &s;o fatal a rever&s;e in her fortune, he gave the baronet a circum&s;tantial account of his daughter's marriage: &s;en&s;ible that he was too much intere&s;ted in this detail to make him think it impertinent, he introduced it no otherways than by declaring him&s;elf under the greate&s;t obligation to mi&s;s Sophia, who having honoured his daughter with her friend&s;hip, had been the chief in&s;trument of her pre&s;ent happine&s;s.</P>
<P>While the good curate related all the circum&s;tances of an affair which had had &s;uch melancholy con&s;e|quences, the baronet li&s;tened to him with an attention &s;till as the grave; his eyes were fixed upon his with a look of the mo&s;t eager anxiety,

and he &s;carce &s;uffered him&s;elf to breathe for fear of lo&s;ing any of his words.</P>
<P>In proportion as his doubts were removed, his countenance e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pre&s;&s;ed more &s;atisfaction, and when, upon his reflecting on all that he had heard, it appeared plainly that the fatal meeting which had cau&s;ed him &s;o much angui&s;h, was the effect of Sophia's &s;olicitude to &s;erve her friend, and that the pa&s;&s;ionate ac|tion of the youth was an acknow|ledgment of gratitude, not an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of love, he was not able to conceal the exce&s;s of his joy, but, ri&s;ing up in a &s;udden tran&s;port, he took the curate's hand, and pre&s;|&s;ing it eagerly, "You know not," &s;aid he,
<Q>Mr. Law&s;on, how happy you have made me! but where is mi&s;s Sophia, is &s;he gone to Bath with her good friend Mr. Herbert?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="210">"No, Sir," replied Mr. Law|&s;on;
<Q>&s;he lives with her mother. You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that Mrs. Darnley has lo&s;t her annuity by the death of the gentleman upon whom it was charged.</Q></P>
<P>"I never heard it till now," &s;aid the baronet, who&s;e tenderne&s;s was alarmed for his Sophia;
<Q>tell me I beg you what is her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Her elde&s;t daughter has left her,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Law&s;on,
<Q>and &s;he has retired with mi&s;s Sophia to a village about five miles from hence, in the road to London, where that excellent young lady &s;upports her mother and her|&s;elf by the labour of her hands.</Q></P>
<P>"Angelick creature!" exclaimed Sir Charles, with his eyes &s;wimming in tears. Then, after a little pau&s;e,
<PB N="200" REF="211">
he de&s;ired a direction to the place where Mrs. Darnley lived, and took a kind leave of Mr. Law&s;on, telling him he hoped &s;oon to vi&s;it him again.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, although he galloped as fa&s;t as it was po&s;&s;ible, found his hor&s;e went too &s;low for his impati|ence; &s;o eager was he to &s;ee Sophia, and gain her pardon for the unrea|&s;onable conduct which his jea|lou&s;y and rage had made him guilty of.</P>
<P>The account Mr. Law&s;on had given him of the part &s;he had taken in his daughter's marriage with the youth whom he had con&s;idered as his rival, not only removed the torturing pangs of jealou&s;y, which he had &s;o long felt, but made him view &s;everal circum&s;tances in So|phia's behaviour in a light favour|able to his own ardent wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="212">He fondly fancied that the me|lancholy in which he had heard &s;he was plunged, was occa&s;ioned by a tender remembrance of him; and that the hope of &s;till being his, might have been the chief cau&s;e of her rejecting the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Howard.</P>
<P>How different were the&s;e ideas from the gloomy ones which had hitherto perplexed his mind! he &s;eemed like a man waked from a frightful dream of de&s;pair and death, to a certainty of life and joy.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e tran&s;porting reve|ries he had pa&s;&s;ed by Sophia's hou&s;e, without perceiving it to be the &s;ame he had been directed to; and when he had reached the end of the village, he looked about for it in vain, and &s;aw no one of whom he could enquire
<PB N="202" REF="213">
for it but an old woman, who was &s;itting under a tree near the road, making up a no&s;egay of &s;ome flowers, &s;uch as the late &s;ea&s;on pro|duced.</P>
<P>He &s;topped his hor&s;e, and a&s;ked her if &s;he knew where Mrs. Darnley lived? At the mention of that name &s;he ro&s;e as ha&s;tily as her feeblene&s;s would permit her, and told him, &s;he knew the hou&s;e very well; and, if he plea&s;ed, would go and &s;hew it him.
<Q>I am making up this no&s;egay for the &s;weet young gentlewo|man her daughter,</Q>
&s;aid the old woman:
<Q>I carry her flowers every day; heaven ble&s;s her, &s;he is my only &s;upport. There is a great many fine folks here|abouts, from whom I could ne|ver get any relief; but &s;ince &s;he came hither I have wanted
<PB N="203" REF="214">
for nothing. Pray let me &s;hew you her hou&s;e; old and weak as I am, I would walk ten miles to do her &s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, alighting from his hor&s;e, ordered his &s;ervant to lead it to the neare&s;t public hou&s;e, and wait for him there; he told the old woman, he would accept of her offer, and walk along with her. Then taking two guineas out of his pocket, he gave them to her, in reward, he &s;aid, for the gratitude &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for her young benefac|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The good woman received his bounty with a tran&s;port of &s;urpri&s;e and joy, and plea&s;ingly repaid him by talking of his beloved Sophia; of whom &s;he related many in|&s;tances of tenderne&s;s and charity to|wards the poor of the village, and filled him with admiration of that

true benevolence, which even in the mid&s;t of indigence, could ad|mini&s;ter to the greater wants of her fellow creatures.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXIX.</HI> Sophia receives an unexpected Vi&s;it.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they came within &s;ight of Sophia's little cot|tage, the old woman, pointing to it, told him, Mrs. Darnley and her daughter lived there: upon which the baronet, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her, walked up to it with di&s;ordered ha&s;te. A row of wooden pales led to a &s;mall gra&s;s-plat before the door.</P>
<P>As he approached, he &s;aw Sophia &s;itting at a window at work. He &s;topped to gaze upon her; &s;he ap|peared to him more lovely, more engaging than ever. He wi&s;hed, yet dreaded her looking up, le&s;t her fir&s;t thoughts upon &s;eeing him be|ing unfavourable, &s;he &s;hould re&s;olve to refu&s;e his vi&s;it. He went for|wards
<PB N="206" REF="217">
with a beating heart, and cautiou&s;ly opening the little gate, reached the door of this humble habitation unheard and un&s;een by Sophia: the door flew open at his touch; poverty has no need of bolts and bars, and every good an|gel is the guard of innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e he made in entering, and the &s;ound of her name, pro|nounced in a tender accent, made Sophia ha&s;tily rai&s;e her head. At &s;ight of Sir Charles, &s;he &s;tarted from her chair, her work fell from her trembling hands, &s;he looked at him in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, una|ble, and perhaps unwilling to avoid him.</P>
<P>The baronet, who&s;e heart la|boured with the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of tenderne&s;s, anxiety, hope, and fear, had not power to utter a word; and while her &s;urpri&s;e kept
<PB N="207" REF="218">
her motionle&s;s, threw him&s;elf at her feet, and taking one of her hands, pre&s;&s;ed it re&s;pectfully to his lips, tears at the &s;ame time falling from his eyes.</P>
<P>Sophia, who&s;e gentle mind was &s;en&s;ibly affected with this action, and the palene&s;s and langour which appeared in his countenance, found it impo&s;&s;ible to treat him with that &s;everity which his capricious con|duct &s;eemed to demand of her; neverthele&s;s, &s;he drew away her hand, which he yielded with re|luctant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I hoped," &s;aid &s;he, in an ac|cent that expre&s;&s;ed more &s;oftne&s;s and grief than anger or di&s;dain,
<Q>that I &s;hould be &s;pared any farther in&s;ults of this &s;ort from you; tho&s;e I have already &s;uf|fered have &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed me for my weak credulity.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, when &s;he began to
<PB N="208" REF="219">
&s;peak, ro&s;e up; but continued gazing on her with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;i|onate tenderne&s;s, while every word &s;he uttered &s;eemed to pierce his heart.</P>
<P>"I will not," pur&s;ued Sophia, gathering firmne&s;s as &s;he &s;poke,
<Q>a&s;k you, why you have intruded upon me thus unexpectedly? or why you a&s;&s;ume a behaviour &s;o little of a-piece with your pa&s;t actions? I only beg you to believe, that I am not again to be deceived; and although I am per&s;uaded my good opinion is of no con|&s;equence to you, yet I will tell you, that if it is po&s;&s;ible to regain it, it will be by never more importuning me with vi|&s;its, which my &s;ituation in life makes it very improper for me to admit of.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="220">Sophia, when &s;he had &s;aid this, went out of the room, without ca&s;ting a look back upon Sir Charles, who followed her in great di&s;order, conjuring her only to hear what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>As &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing to her own chamber, &s;he was met by her mo|ther, who &s;eeing Sir Charles, was filled with &s;urpri&s;e and joy; and perceiving that Sophia was avoid|ing him, cried to her with an an|gry accent,
<Q>Where are you go|ing? what is the meaning of this rudene&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, without an&s;wering her, retired to her own room, not without great perturbation of mind; for there was &s;omething in the baronet's looks and words that &s;eemed to merit a hearing at lea&s;t; but &s;he dreaded the weakne&s;s of her own heart, and was fully per|&s;uaded that any conde&s;cen&s;ion on
<PB N="210" REF="221">
her &s;ide would give him too great an advantage over her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, finding any endea|vours to retain her were fruitle&s;s, advanced towards Sir Charles with great ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, congratulated him upon his return, and thanked him for the honour he did her in vi&s;iting her in her poor little ha|bitation.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;aluted her re&s;pect|fully, and took a &s;eat.
<Q>There is a &s;ad alteration, Sir,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>in my poor affairs &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t. I never thought to have received you in &s;uch a ho|vel! You have heard, I &s;uppo&s;e, of my misfortune?</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, who was in great confu&s;ion of thought, and had &s;carce heard a word &s;he &s;aid, replied care|le&s;sly,
<Q>Yes, madam, I am &s;orry for it.</Q></P>
<P>The coldne&s;s of this an&s;wer ca&s;t
<PB N="211" REF="222">
a damp upon tho&s;e hopes which &s;he had eagerly admitted upon &s;eeing him again; and, impatient to be relieved from her torment|ing anxiety on account of this un|expected vi&s;it, &s;he a&s;ked him abruptly,
<Q>whether &s;he might wi&s;h him joy, for &s;he heard,</Q>
&s;he &s;aid,
<Q>that he was going to be married.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, rouzed by this que&s;|tion, replied ha&s;tily,
<Q>Who could have told you any thing &s;o un|likely? Married! no, madam, there never was any foundation for &s;uch a report.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed I believe &s;o," &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, almo&s;t breathle&s;s with joy to find him deny it &s;o ear|ne&s;tly.
<Q>To be &s;ure people are very envious and ill-natured, and tho&s;e who told me, no doubt, de&s;igned to do you an ill office.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="223">"And they have &s;ucceeded," &s;aid Sir Charles, &s;ighing,
<Q>if they have been able to per&s;uade mi&s;s Sophia, that after having a&s;pir|ed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, I could de&s;cend to love any other woman. I came to implore her pardon, madam,</Q>
pur&s;ued he,
<Q>for all the extravagancies of my pa&s;t conduct, and for that unrea&s;onable jealou&s;y which was the &s;ource of them, could I have been &s;o happy to have prevailed upon her to have heard me.</Q></P>
<P>"What!" interrupted Mrs. Darnley eagerly,
<Q>and was my daughter &s;o rude as to leave you without hearing what you had to &s;ay. I prote&s;t I am a&s;ham|ed of her behaviour; but I hope you will be &s;o good to excu&s;e it, Sir; I will in&s;i&s;t upon her com|ing in again.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="224">"No, madam," &s;aid Sir Charles, holding her, for &s;he was hurrying a|way,
<Q>mi&s;s Sophia mu&s;t not be con|&s;trained: I cannot bear that.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley unwillingly re&s;um|ed her &s;eat, and inly fretting at her daughter's ob&s;tinacy, trembled for the event of this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, after a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes, &s;uddenly ro&s;e up, and took his leave. Mrs. Darn|ley, in great anxiety, followed him to the door, and &s;aid &s;he hoped to &s;ee him again. He an&s;wered only by a low bow, and walked away full of doubt and perplexity.</P>
<P>Sophia's &s;teadine&s;s in refu&s;ing to hear him, bani&s;hed all tho&s;e flat|tering ideas of her tenderne&s;s for him, which he had &s;o eagerly ad|mitted; for he concluded that if her heart had not been &s;teeled by indifference, &s;he would, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="214" REF="225">
her ju&s;t rea&s;ons for re&s;entment, have been rejoiced to give him an opportunity of ju&s;tify|ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He had reached the hou&s;e where his &s;ervant was attending with the hor&s;es, without having determin|ed what to do. To return to town without &s;eeing Sophia again, and being a&s;&s;ured of a reconcilia|tion, was mi&s;ery which he could not &s;upport; and he dreaded mak|ing a new attempt to &s;ee her, le&s;t he &s;hould receive more proofs of her in&s;en&s;ibility and di&s;dain.</P>
<P>In this perplexity the &s;ight of Mr. Herbert alighting from a &s;tage-coach, was a relief as great as it was unexpected; and in the &s;ud|den joy he felt at meeting with a man who&s;e interpo&s;ition could be &s;o u&s;eful to him, he forgot that his former behaviour mu&s;t

nece&s;&s;arily have given ri&s;e to &s;trong prejudices again&s;t him, and ran up to embrace the good old man with extreme cordia|lity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XL.</HI> In which the Hi&s;tory begins to grow dull.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert was &s;urpri&s;ed at this meeting, and repaid the civilities of the young baronet with &s;ome coldne&s;s: upon which Sir Charles, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, de|&s;ired to have a few moments con|ver&s;ation with him.</P>
<P>They walked together down a meadow; and Sir Charles, hav|ing with a candor and &s;incerity becoming the rectitude of his in|tentions, related all tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances which had concurred to excite his jealou&s;y, and with that powerful eloquence which pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pires, expatiated upon
<PB N="217" REF="228">
the motives of his conduct, a conduct which he acknowledged laid him open to the mo&s;t un|favourable &s;u&s;picions; Mr. Her|bert, convinced of his &s;incerity, and full of compa&s;&s;ion for the unea&s;ine&s;s which his mi&s;taken jealou&s;y had cau&s;ed him, under|took to make his peace with Sophia, and a&s;&s;ured him he would very &s;hortly wait upon him in town.</P>
<P>This would not &s;atisfy the anxious lover; he declared he would not leave the place till he was a&s;&s;ured of his pardon; and Mr. Herbert, who certainly was not di&s;plea&s;ed with his ob|&s;tinacy, could with difficulty per|&s;uade him to wait only till the next day for an account of his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir Charles unwillingly took
<PB N="218" REF="229">
the road to London, and Mr. Herbert ha&s;tened to congratu|late his beloved charge upon the agreeable pro&s;pect that was once more opening for her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley had, during this interval, been employed in re|proaching poor Sophia for her behaviour to Sir Charles. In the vexation of her heart, &s;he exclaimed in the &s;evere&s;t terms again&s;t her pride and ob&s;tina|cy; &s;he told her, &s;he might be a&s;&s;ured Sir Charles would never attempt to &s;ee her again; that it was plain he was di&s;gu&s;ted with her bad temper.</P>
<P>She bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion of tears, while &s;he enumerated the glorious advantages of that rank and fortune, which, &s;he &s;aid, Sophia had thrown from her; and among many motives which
<PB N="219" REF="230">
&s;he urged, ought to have deter|mined her to act otherwi&s;e, that of being able to out-&s;hine her &s;i&s;ter was one.</P>
<P>Sophia an&s;wered only by &s;ighs: &s;he her&s;elf was not ab&s;olutely &s;a|tisfied with the unrelenting &s;e|verity with which &s;he had treat|ed Sir Charles. The more &s;he reflected upon his behaviour, the more &s;he condemned her&s;elf for not hearing what he had to offer in his own de|fence.</P>
<P>She had once thought it proba|ble that he had been deceived by the report that was &s;pread through Mrs. Gibbons's folly, of her encouraging the addre&s;&s;es of her nephew, and his extravagant conduct might be occa&s;ioned by jealou&s;y: a fault which a woman is always di&s;po&s;ed to pardon in a

lover. While &s;he revolved the&s;e thoughts in her mind, Mrs. Darnley perceived her unea&s;ine&s;s, and added to it by new re|proaches.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert's arrival put an end to this tormenting &s;cene. Sophia fir&s;t heard his voice, and flew to receive him; Mrs. Darn|ley followed, and &s;eeing her bath|ed in tears, while the good old man &s;aluted her with the ten|derne&s;s of a parent, &s;he told him, with an air half &s;erious, half gay, that her daughter loved him &s;o well, &s;he had no affec|tion for any one el&s;e. She then entered abruptly upon the affair of Sir Charles, though &s;he hard|ly expected Mr. Herbert would join with her in condemning Sophia.</P>
<P>He plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed her by
<PB N="221" REF="234">
&s;aying, that Sophia was to blame; and that he came prepared to chide her for her petulance and ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who &s;aw a &s;weet impatience in Sophia's looks, explained him&s;elf immediately, and told her he had met Sir Charles; who had fully remov|ed all the &s;u&s;picions his &s;trange conduct had occa&s;ioned, and convinced him, that he de&s;erved more pity than cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>"No doubt." pur&s;ued he, look|ing on Sophia with a &s;mile,
<Q>you will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, young lady, that Sir Charles was witne&s;s to the interview you had in the mea|dow behind Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e, with a certain hand|&s;ome youth, whom he had
<PB N="222" REF="235">
heard was his rival, and a favoured rival too. What were his thoughts, do you imagine, when he &s;aw this hand&s;ome youth throw him&s;elf at your feet, and ki&s;s your hand?</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley now looked at her daughter in great a&s;toni&s;h|ment; and Sophia, who yet did not recollect the circum&s;tance of her meeting William, was &s;o per|plexed, &s;he knew not what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert enjoyed her in|nocent confu&s;ion for a few mo|ments, and then repeated all that Sir Charles had told him, of his jealou&s;y and rage; his vain attempts to bani&s;h her from his remembrance; the re&s;olution he had formed after his con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="223" REF="236">
with Mr. Howard con|cerning her; and how happily he had been undeceived at Mr. Law&s;on's, where he found his &s;uppo&s;ed rival was the hu&s;band of her friend.</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted Mrs. Darnley, with great vehemence,
<Q>I hope you are &s;atisfied now, Sophia! I hope you will treat Sir Charles with more civi|lity if he comes again.&mdash;Mr. Herbert, I beg you will exert your power over her upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;I think there is no doubt of Sir Charles's honourable intentions.</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;he ran on, while So|phia, who had li&s;tened to Mr. Herbert's relation with the &s;oft|e&s;t emotions of pity, tender|ne&s;s, and joy, continued &s;ilent
<PB N="224" REF="237">
with her eyes fixed upon the ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, willing to &s;pare her delicacy, told Mrs. Darn|ley, that relying upon Sophia's good &s;en&s;e and prudence, he had ventured to a&s;&s;ure Sir Charles of a more favourable recepti|on, when her prejudices were re|moved.</P>
<P><Q>He will come to-morrow, my child,</Q>
pur&s;ued he,
<Q>to implore your pardon for all the errors of his pa&s;t conduct, and to offer you his hand. I am per&s;uaded you will act properly upon this occa&s;ion; and in a marriage &s;o far be|yond your hopes and expec|tations, acknowledge the hand of Providence, which thinks fit to reward you, even in
<PB N="225" REF="238">
this world, for your &s;teady ad|herence to virtue.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia bowed and blu&s;hed; her mother, in a rapture, embraced and wi&s;hed her joy.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert now endeavoured to change the conver&s;ation to &s;ub|jects more indifferent; but Mrs. Darnley, ever thoughtle&s;s and un&s;ea&s;onable, could talk of no|thing but Sir Charles, and the grandeur which awaited her daughter.</P>
<P>All night her fancy ran upon gilt equipages, rich jewels, mag|nificent hou&s;es, and a train of &s;ervants; and &s;he was by much too happy to ta&s;te any re|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Sophia enjoyed the change of her fortune with much more rational delight; and among
<PB N="226" REF="239">
all the &s;entiments that aro&s;e in her mind upon this occa&s;ion, that of gratitude to heaven was the mo&s;t frequent and the mo&s;t lively.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLI.</HI> The Hi&s;tory concluded.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert, who had accept|ed a lodging in Sophia's cottage, went to Sir Charles the next day, according to his pro|mi&s;e. He found him waiting for him full of anxious impatience; and hearing from the good old man, that Sophia was di&s;po&s;ed to receive him favourably, he embrac|ed him in a tran&s;port of joy; and his chariot being already ordered, they drove immediately to the village.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley welcomed the baronet with a profu&s;ion of civi|lities. Sophia's behaviour was full of dignity, mingled with
<PB N="228" REF="241">
that &s;oftne&s;s peculiar to her cha|racter.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, after a long con|ver&s;ation with her, obtained her leave to demand her of her mo|ther, to whom he &s;hewed the writings, which were already all drawn; and by which Sophia had a jointure and pin-money, equal to the &s;ettlements that had been made upon Lady Stan|ley.</P>
<P>He now ventured to intreat that a &s;hort day might be fixed for their marriage. It was with great difficulty, that Sophia was pre|vailed upon to con&s;ent; but her mother's impetuo&s;ity carried all before it, and Mr. Herbert him|&s;elf &s;upported the young baronet's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The ceremony was performed by Mr. Law&s;on in his own pari&s;h-church:
<PB N="229" REF="242">
after which he and his amiable family accompanied the new wedded pair to their country-&s;eat, where they pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days with them.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert having previou&s;ly acquainted Sir Charles with Har|riot's &s;ituation, the baronet, tho' he dete&s;ted her character, and de|clared he never could pardon her for the mi&s;eries &s;he had cau&s;ed him; yet was de&s;irous to have her decently &s;ettled, and pro|mi&s;ed to give a thou&s;and pounds with her in marriage, if a reput|able match could be found for her: he even put notes for that &s;um into Mr. Herbert's hands, and earne&s;tly recommended it to him, to take the affair under his ma|nagement.</P>
<P>Harriot, during the time &s;he lived with her mother, had been

courted by a young trade&s;man in tolerable circum&s;tances; and although &s;he thought it great in|&s;olence for a per&s;on in bu&s;ine&s;s to pretend to her, yet, actuated by a true &s;pirit of coquetry, while &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed the lover, &s;he took plea&s;ure in his addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This young man &s;till retained &s;ome tenderne&s;s for her, and al|lured by the pro&s;pect of a for|tune, was willing, notwith&s;tand|ing any faults in her conduct, to make her his wife.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley propo&s;ed him to her, and Mr. Herbert enforced her advice with all the good &s;en&s;e he was ma&s;ter of. But Harriot received the propo&s;al with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain; in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he was married as well as her &s;i&s;ter; that her rank in life was &s;uperior to hers; and added, by way of
<PB N="231" REF="244">
threat, that her appearance &s;hould be &s;o likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The extraordinary efforts &s;he made to &s;upport this boa&s;t en|gaged lord L. in expences that en|tirely alienated his affections from her, di&s;gu&s;ted as he long had been with her in&s;olence and folly.</P>
<P>His relations concluded a match for him with a young lady of &s;uitable rank and fortune; and, after making a &s;mall &s;ettlement on Harriot, he took leave of her for ever.</P>
<P>The vexation &s;he felt from this incident, threw her into a di&s;|temper very fatal to beauty. The yellow jaundice made &s;uch ravage in her face, that &s;carce any of tho&s;e charms on which &s;he had valued her&s;elf &s;o much, remained. All her anxious hours
<PB N="232" REF="245">
were now employed in repairing her complexion, and in vain en|deavours to re&s;tore lu&s;tre to tho&s;e eyes, &s;unk in hollowne&s;s, and tinctured with the hue of her di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Although thus altered, the re|port of the fortune &s;he was likely to have made her be thought a prize worthy the ambition of a young officer, who had quitted the bu&s;ine&s;s of a peruke maker, in which he was bred, for an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion, which made him a gentleman at once.</P>
<P>He offered him&s;elf to Harriot with that a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s, which the gaiety of his ap|pearance, and his title of cap|tain, gave him rea&s;on to expect, with a lady of her turn of mind.</P>
<P>Harriot, charmed with &s;o im|portant
<PB N="233" REF="246">
a conque&s;t, &s;oon con|&s;ented to give him her hand; and Sir Charles Stanley, finding his character not exceptionable, gave her the fortune he had promi&s;ed, to which Sophia ge|nerou&s;ly added a thou&s;and pounds more. The baronet procured her hu&s;band a better commi&s;&s;ion; but de&s;ignedly in one of the colonies, whither he in&s;i&s;ted upon his wife's accompanying him.</P>
<P>Harriot, in de&s;pair at being obliged to quit the delights of London, &s;oon began to hate her hu&s;band heartily, and he, enter|ing into her di&s;po&s;ition and cha|racter, lo&s;t all e&s;teem and ten|derne&s;s for her. Her behaviour ju&s;tified the rigid confinement he kept her in; and while &s;he &s;uffered all the re&s;traint of jea|lou&s;y,
<PB N="234" REF="247">
&s;he was at the &s;ame time mortified with the knowledge that pride and not love was the &s;ource of it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley lived not long after the departure of her favourite daughter; for &s;o Harriot always continued to be.</P>
<P>Sophia attended her mother du|ring her long illne&s;s with the mo&s;t duteous care, and had the &s;atisfaction to be a&s;&s;ured by Mr. Law&s;on, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in her preparations for death, that her attachment to the world, which the affluent circum&s;tances to which &s;he was rai&s;ed but too much increa&s;ed, had at length given way to more pious &s;enti|ments; and &s;he died with the re&s;ignation of a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The ill conduct of her &s;i&s;ter, and the death of her mother,
<PB N="235" REF="248">
proved at fir&s;t &s;ome interruption to Sophia's happine&s;s; but the&s;e dome&s;tic &s;torms blown over, &s;he began to ta&s;te the good fortune which heaven had be&s;towed on her: her chief enjoyment of it was to &s;hare it with others; and Sir Charles, who adored her, put it amply in her power to indulge the benevolence of her di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>He took upon him&s;elf the care of rewarding her friends; he pre&s;ented Mr. Law&s;on to a very con&s;iderable living: he pro|cured Dolly's hu&s;band a genteel and lucrative employment; and married her &s;i&s;ter to a relation of his own.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who was above receiving any other gratification from Sir Charles than the entire friend&s;hip which he ever pre|&s;erved
<PB N="236" REF="249">
for him, had the &s;atis|faction to &s;pend mo&s;t part of his time with his beloved daugh|ter, as he u&s;ed tenderly to call Sophia, and to behold her as happy as the condition of mor|tality admits of.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's tenderne&s;s for her &s;eemed to increa&s;e every day; and when Mr. Herbert &s;ome years after this marriage took occa&s;ion to compliment him up|on the delicacy, the ardor, and the con&s;tancy of his affection, he replied,
<Q>You attribute to me a virtue, which, in this ca&s;e, I cannot be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s; had my pa&s;&s;ion for my So|phia been founded only on the charms of her per&s;on, I might probably ere now have become a mere fa&s;hionable hu&s;band; but her virtue and
<PB N="237" REF="250">
wit &s;upply her with graces ever varied, and ever new. Thus the &s;teadine&s;s of my af|fection for her,</Q>
pur&s;ued he, &s;miling,
<Q>is but a con&s;tant in|con&s;tancy, which attaches me &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to one or other of tho&s;e &s;hining qualities, of which her charming mind is an inex|hau&s;tible &s;ource.</Q></P>
