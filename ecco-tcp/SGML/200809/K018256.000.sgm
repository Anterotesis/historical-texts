<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Succe&s;s the for|mer Part of this Work has met with in the World, has yet been no other than is ac|knowledg'd to be due to the &s;ur|pri&s;ing Variety of the Subject, and to the agreeable Manner of the Performance.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
All the Endeavours of en|vious People to reproach it with being a Romance, to &s;earch it for Errors in Geography, Incon|&s;i&s;tency in the Relation, and Con|tradictions in the Fact, have pro|ved abortive, and as impotent as malicious.</P>
<P>The ju&s;t Application of every Incident, the religious and u&s;eful Inferences drawn from every Part, are &s;o many Te&s;timonies to the good De&s;ign of making it publick, and must legitimate all the Part that may be call'd Inventi|on, or Parable in the Story.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
The Second Part, if the E|ditor's Opinion may pa&s;s, is (con|trary to the U&s;age of Second Parts,) every Way as entertain|ing as the First, contains as &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing Incidents, and as great a Variety of them; nor is the Application le&s;s &s;erious, or &s;uitable; and doubtle&s;s will, to the &s;ober, as well as ingenious Reader, be every way as profi|table and diverting; and this makes the abridging this Work, as &s;candalous, as it is knavi&s;h and ridiculous, &s;eeing, while to &s;horten the Book, that they may &s;eem to reduce the Value, they &s;trip it of all tho&s;e Reflections, as well religious as moral, which
<PB REF="5">
are not only the greatest Beautys of the Work, but are calculated for the infinite Advantage of the Reader.</P>
<P>By this they leave the Work naked of its brightest Ornaments; and if they would, at the &s;ame Time pretend, that the Author has &s;upply'd the Story out of his Invention, they take from it the Improvement, which alone re|commends that Invention to wi&s;e and good Men.</P>
<P>The Injury the&s;e Men do the Proprietor of this Work, is a Practice all honest Men abhor; and he believes he may challenge them to &s;hew the Difference be|tween
<PB REF="6">
that and Robbing on the Highway, or Breaking open a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>If they can't &s;hew any Dif|ference in the Crime, they will find it hard to &s;hew why there &s;hould be any Difference in the Puni&s;h|ment: And he will an&s;wer for it, that nothing &s;hall be wanting on his Part, to do them Justice.</P>

<HEAD>The FARTHER ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THAT homely Proverb u&s;ed on &s;o many Occa&s;ions in <HI>England, viz. That what is bred in the Bone will not go out of the Fle&s;h,</HI> was never more verify'd, than in the Story of my Life. Any one would think, that after thirty-five Years Affliction, and a Va|riety of unhappy Circum&s;tances, which few Men, if any ever, went thro' before, and after near &s;e|ven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fulne&s;s of all Things; grown old, and when, <HI>if ever,</HI> it might be allowed me to have had experience of every State of middle Life, and to know which was mo&s;t adapted to make a Man compleat|ly happy: I &s;ay, after all this, any one would have thought that the native Propen&s;ity to ramb|ling,
<PB N="2" REF="11">
which I gave an Account of in my fir&s;t Setting out into the World, to have been &s;o pre dominate in my Thoughts, &s;hould be worn out the volatile Part be fully evacuated, or at lea&s;t condens'd, and I might at 61 Years of Age have been a little enclin'd to &s;tay at Home, and have done venturing Life and Fortune any more</P>
<P>Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Adventures was taken away in me; for I had no Fortune to make, I had nothing to &s;eek: If I had gain'd ten thou&s;and Pound, I had been no richer; for I had already &s;ufficient for me, and for tho&s;e I had to leave it to; and that I had was vi&s;ibly encrea&s;ing; for having no great Family, I could not &s;pend the Income of what I had, unle&s;s I would &s;et up for an expen&s;ive Way of Living, &s;uch as a great Family, Servants, Equipage, Gayety, and <HI>the like,</HI> which were Things I had no Notion of, or Inclination to; &s;o that I had nothing indeed to do, but to &s;it &s;till, and fully enjoy what I had got, and &s;ee it encrea&s;e daily upon my Hands.</P>
<P>Yet all the&s;e Things had no Effect upon me, or at lea&s;t, not enough to re&s;i&s;t the &s;trong Inclination I had to go Abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical Di&s;temper; particularly the De|&s;ire of &s;eeing my new Plantation in the I&s;land, and the Colony I left there, run in my Head con|tinually. I dream'd of it all Night, and my Ima|gination run upon it all Day; it was uppermo&s;t in all my Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd &s;o &s;teadi|ly and &s;trongly upon it, that I talk'd of it out of Sleep; in &s;hort, nothing could remove it out of my Mind; it even broke &s;o violently into all my Di&s;cour&s;es, that it made my Conver&s;ation tire|&s;ome;
<PB N="3" REF="12">
for I could talk of nothing el&s;e, all my Di&s;cour&s;e run into it, even to Impertinence, and I &s;aw it my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I have often heard Per&s;ons of good Judgment &s;ay, That all the Stir People make in the World about Gho&s;ts and Apparitions, is owing to the Strength of Imagination, and the powerful Ope|ration of Fancy in their Minds; that there is no &s;uch Thing as a Spirit appearing, or a Gho&s;t wal|king, <HI>and the like:</HI> That Peoples poring affectio|nately upon the pa&s;t Conver&s;ation of their deceas'd Friends, &s;o realizes it to them, that they are capa|ble of fancying upon &s;ome extraordinary Circum|&s;tances, that they &s;ee them; talk to them, and are an&s;wered by them, when, in Truth, there is no|thing but Shadow and Vapour in the Thing; and they really know nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whe|ther there are any &s;uch Things as real Apparitions, Spectres, or walking of People after they are dead, or whether there is any Thing in the Stories they tell us of that Kind, more than the Product of Vapours, &s;ick Minds, and wandring Fancies; But this I know, that my Imagination work'd up to &s;uch a Height, and brought me into &s;uch Exta|&s;ies of Vapours, or what el&s;e I may call it, that I actually &s;uppos'd my &s;elf, often times upon the Spot, at my old Ca&s;tle behind the Trees; &s;aw my old <HI>Spaniard, Friday</HI>'s Father, and the reprobate Sai|lors I left upon the I&s;land; nay, I fancy'd I talk'd with them, and look'd at them &s;o &s;teadily, tho' I was broad awake, as at Per&s;ons ju&s;t before me; and this I did till I often frighted my &s;elf with the Images my Fancy repre&s;ented to me: One Time in my Sleep I had the Villany of the 3 Pyrate Sai|lors
<PB N="4" REF="13">
&s;o lively related to me by the fir&s;t <HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father, that it was &s;urprizing; they told me how they barbarou&s;ly attempted to murder all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that they &s;et Fire to the Provi&s;ions they had laid up, on Purpo&s;e to di&s;tre&s;s and &s;tarve them, Things that I had never heard of, and that indeed were never all of them true in Fact: But it was &s;o warm in my Imagination, and &s;o realiz'd to me, that to the Hour I &s;aw them, I could not be per&s;uaded, but that it was or would be true; al&s;o how I re&s;ented it, when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> com|plain'd to me, and how I brought them to Ju&s;tice, try'd them before me, and order'd them all three to be hang'd: What there was really in this, &s;hall be &s;een in its Place: For however, I came to form &s;uch Things in my Dream, and what &s;ecret Con|ver&s;e of Spirits injected it, yet there was very much of it true. I &s;ay, I own, that this Dream had no|thing in it literally and &s;pecifically true: But the general Part was &s;o true, the ba&s;e villanious Beha|viour of the&s;e three harden'd Rogues was &s;uch, and had been &s;o much wor&s;e than all I can de&s;cribe, that the Dream had too much Similitude of the Fact, and as I would afterwards have puni&s;hed them &s;everely; &s;o if I had hang'd them all, I had been much in the Right, and &s;hould ha' been ju|&s;tifiable both by the Laws of God and Man.</P>
<P>But to return to my Story; in this Kind of Temper I had liv'd &s;ome Years, I had no Enjoy|ment of my Life, no plea&s;ant Hours, no agreeable Diver&s;ion but what had &s;ome Thing or other of this in it; &s;o that my Wife, who &s;aw my Mind &s;o wholly bent upon it, told me very &s;eriou&s;ly one Night, That &s;he believ'd there was &s;ome &s;ecret powerful Impul&s;e of Providence upon me, which had determin'd me to go thither again; and that
<PB N="5" REF="14">
&s;he found nothing hindred my going, but my being engag'd to a Wife and Children. She told me that it was true &s;he could not think of parting with me; but as &s;he was a&s;&s;ur'd, that if &s;he was dead, it would be the fir&s;t Thing I would do: So as it &s;eem'd to her, that the Thing was determin'd above, &s;he would not be the only Ob&s;truction: for if I thought fit, and ro&s;olv'd to go&mdash;here &s;he found me very intent upon her Words, and that I look'd very earne&s;tly at her; &s;o that it a lit|tle di&s;order'd her, and &s;he &s;topp'd. I ask'd her, Why &s;he did not go on, and &s;ay out what &s;he was going to &s;ay? But I perceiv'd her Heart was too full, and &s;ome Tears &s;tood in her Eyes: Speak out my Dear, &s;aid I, Are you willing I &s;hould go? No, <HI>&s;ays &s;he very affectionately,</HI> I am far from willing: But if you are re&s;olv'd to go, &s;ays &s;he, and rather than I will be the only Hindrance, I will go with you; for tho' I think it a mo&s;t prepo&s;terous Thing for one of your Years, and in your Condition, yet if it mu&s;t be, &s;aid &s;he again weeping, I won't leave you; for if it be of Heaven, you mu&s;t do it. There is no re&s;i&s;ting it; and if Heaven makes it your Duty to go, he will al&s;o make it mine to go with you, or otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of me, that I may not ob&s;truct it.</P>
<P>This affectionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought me a little out of the Vapours, and I be|gan to con&s;ider what I was a doing; I corrected my wandring Fancy, and began to argue with my &s;elf &s;edately, what Bu&s;ine&s;s I had after three&s;core Years, and after &s;uch a Life of tedious Sufferings and Di&s;a&s;ters, and clo&s;ed in &s;o happy and ea&s;y a Manner, I &s;ay, what Bu&s;ine&s;s I had to ru&s;h into new Hazards. and put my &s;elf upon Adven|tures, fit only for Youth and Poverty to run into.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="15">
With tho&s;e Thoughts, I con&s;idered my new En|gagement, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife then great with Child of another; that I had all the World could give me, and had no Need to &s;eek Hazards for Gain; that I was de|clining in Years, and ought to think rather of lea|ving what I had gain'd, than of &s;eeking to en|crea&s;e it; that as to what my Wife had &s;aid, of its being an Impul&s;e from Heaven, and that it &s;hould be my Duty to go, I had no Notion of that; &s;o after many of the&s;e Cogitations, I &s;truggled with the Power of my Imagination, rea&s;on'd my &s;elf out of it, <HI>as I believe People may always do in like Ca&s;es, if they will;</HI> and, in a Word, I conquer'd it; com|pos'd my &s;elf with &s;uch Arguments as occur'd to my Thought, and which my pre&s;ent Condition furni&s;h'd me plentifully with, and particularly, as the mo&s;t effectual Method, I re&s;olv'd to divert my &s;elf with other Things, and to engage in &s;ome Bu|&s;ine&s;s that might effectually tye me up from any more Excur&s;ions of this Kind; for I found that Thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or any Thing of Moment im|mediately before me.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e I bought a little Farm in the Country of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and re&s;olv'd to remove my &s;elf thither. I had a little convenient Hou&s;e upon it, and the Land about it I found was capable of great Improvement, and that it was many Ways &s;uited to my Inclination, which delighted in Cul|tivating, Managing, Planting and Improving of Land; and particularly, being an Inland Country, I was remov'd from conver&s;ing among Ships, Sai|lors, and Things relating to the remote Part of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16">
In a Word, I went down to my Farm, &s;ettled my Family, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Wagon, Hor&s;es, Cows, Sheep; and &s;etting &s;e|riou&s;ly to Work, became in one half Year, a meer Country Gentleman; my Thoughts were entire|ly taken up in managing my Servants, cultivating the Ground, Enclo&s;ing, Planting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I liv'd, as I thought, the mo&s;t agreeable Life that Nature was capable of directing, or that a Man always bred to Misfortunes was capable of being retrea|ted to.</P>
<P>I farm'd upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay, was limited by no Articles; I could pull up or cut down as I plea&s;ed: What I planted, was for my &s;elf, and what I improved, was for my Family; and having thus left off the Thoughts of Wand|ring, I had not the lea&s;t Di&s;comfort in any Part of Life, as to this World. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoy'd the middle State of Life, that my Father &s;o earne&s;tly recommended to me, and liv'd a kind of heavenly Life, &s;omething like what is de&s;cribed by the Poet upon the Subject of a Country Life.<Q><L><HI>Free from Vices, free from Care,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Age has no Pain, and Youth no Snare.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow from unfore&s;een Providence unhing'd me at once; and not only made a Breach upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its Con&s;equences, in|to a deep Relap&s;e into the wandring Di&s;po&s;ition, which, as I may &s;ay, being born in my very Blood, &s;oon recover'd its hold of me, and like the Returns of a violent Di&s;temper, came on with an
<PB N="8" REF="17">
irre&s;i&s;tible Force upon me; &s;o that nothing could make any more Impre&s;&s;ion upon me. This Blow was the Lo&s;s of my Wife.</P>
<P>It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to write an Elegy upon my Wife, give a Character of her particular Vir|tues, and make my Court to the Sex by the Flat|tery of a Funeral Sermon. She was, in a few Words, the Stay of all my Affairs, the Center of all my Enterprizes, the Engine, that by her Pru|dence reduc'd me to that happy Compa&s;s I was in, from the mo&s;t extravagant and ruinous Project that flutter'd in my Head, as above; and did more to guide my rambling Genius, than a Mo|ther's Tears, a Father's In&s;tructions, a Friend's Coun&s;el, or all my own rea&s;oning Powers could do. I was happy in li&s;tening to her Tears, and in be|ing mov'd by her Entreaties, and to the la&s;t De|gree de&s;olate and di&s;located in the World by the Lo&s;s of her.</P>
<P>When &s;he was gone, the World look'd aukwardly round me; I was as much a Stranger in it, in my Thoughts, as I was in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> when I went fir&s;t on Shore there; and as much alone, except as to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Servants, as I was in my I&s;land. I knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I &s;aw the World bu&s;y round me, one Part labouring for Bread, and the other Part &s;quan|dring in vile Exce&s;&s;es or empty Plea&s;ures, equally mi&s;erable, becau&s;e the End they propos'd &s;till fled from them; for the Man of Plea&s;ure every Day &s;urfeited of his Vice, and heap'd up Work for Sorrow and Repentance; and the Man of Labour &s;pent their Strength in daily Strugglings for Breadto maintain the vital Strength they labour'd with, &s;o living in a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living but
<PB N="9" REF="18">
to work, and working but to live, as if daily Bread where the only End of weari&s;ome Life, and a weari&s;ome Life the only Occa&s;ion of daily Bread.</P>
<P>This put me in Mind of the Life I liv'd in my Kingdom, the I&s;land; where I &s;uffer'd no more Corn to grow, becau&s;e I did not want it; and bred no more Goats, becau&s;e I had no more U&s;e for them: Where the Money lay in the Drawer 'till it grew mouldy, and had &s;carce the Favour to be look'd upon in 20 Years.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things, had I improv'd them as I ought to have done, and as Rea&s;on and Religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to &s;earch farther than human Enjoyments for a full Felicity, and that there was &s;omething which cer|tainly was the Rea&s;on and End of Life, &s;uperiour to all the&s;e Things, and which was either to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, or at lea&s;t hop'd for on this Side the Grave.</P>
<P>But my Sage Coun&s;ellor was gone, I was like a Ship without a Pilot, that could only run afore the Wind: My Thoughts run all away again into the old Affair, my Head quite was turn'd with the Whim&s;ies of foreign Adventures, and all the plea|&s;ant innocent Amu&s;ements of my Farm, and my Garden, my Cattle, and my Family, which be|fore entirely po&s;&s;e&s;t me, were nothing to me, had no Reli&s;h, and were like Mu&s;ick to one that has no Ear, or Food to one that has no Ta&s;te: In a Word, I re&s;olv'd to leave off Hou&s;e-keeping, lett my Farm, and return to <HI>London;</HI> and in a few Months after, I did &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19">
When I came to <HI>London,</HI> I was &s;till as unea&s;y as I was before, I had no Reli&s;h to the Place, no Employment in it, nothing to do but to &s;aunter about like an idle Per&s;on, of whom it may be &s;aid, he is perfectly u&s;ele&s;s in God's Creation; and it is not one Farthing Matter to the re&s;t of his Kind, whether he be dead or alive. This al&s;o was the Life which of all Circum&s;tances of Life was the mo&s;t my Aver&s;ion, who had been all my Days u|&s;ed to an active Life; and I would often &s;ay to my &s;elf, <HI>A State of Idlene&s;s is the very Dregs of Life;</HI> and indeed I thought I was much more &s;uitably employ'd, when I was 26 Days a making me a Deal Board.</P>
<P>It was now the Beginning of the Year 1693, when my Nephew, who as I had ob&s;erv'd before I had brought up to the Sea, and had made him Commander of a Ship, was come Home from a &s;hort Voyage to <HI>Bilboa,</HI> being the fir&s;t he had made; and he came to me, and told me, that &s;ome Merchants of his Acquaintance had been propo&s;ing to him to go a Voyage for them to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> and to <HI>China,</HI> as private Traders: And now Uncle, &s;ays he, if you will go to Sea with me, I'll engage to land you upon your old Habitation in the I&s;land, for we are to touch at the <HI>Bra&s;ils.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing can be a greater Demon&s;tration of a future State, and of the Exi&s;tence of an invi&s;ible World, than the Concurence of &s;econd Cau&s;es, with the Ideas of Things, which we form in our Minds, perfectly re&s;erv'd, and not communicated to any in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="20">
My Nephew knew nothing how far my Di|&s;temper of wandring was return'd upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his Thoughts to &s;ay, when that very Morning before he came to me, I had in a great deal of Confu&s;ion of Thought, and revolving every Part of my Circum&s;tances in my Mind, come to this Re&s;olution, <HI>viz.</HI> That I would go to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and con&s;ult with my old Sea-Captain; and &s;o if it was rational and practi|cable, I would go and &s;ee the I&s;land again, and &s;ee what was become of my People there. I had pleas'd my &s;elf with the Thoughts of peopling the Place, and carrying Inhabitants from hence, getting a Patent for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and I know not what; when in the Middle of all this, in comes my Nephew, as I have &s;aid, with his Pro|ject of carrying me thither, in his Way to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I paus'd a while at his Words, and looking &s;teadily at him, <HI>What Devil,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>&s;ent you of this unlucky Errand?</HI> My Nephew &s;tartl'd as if he had been frighted at fir&s;t; but perceiving I was not much di&s;pleas'd with the Propo&s;al, he recover'd him&s;elf. I hope it may not be an unlucky Propo|&s;al, Sir, &s;ays he, I dare &s;ay you would be pleas'd to &s;ee your new Colony there, where you once reigned with more Felicity, than mo&s;t of your Brother Monarchs in the World.</P>
<P>In a Word, the Scheme hit &s;o exactly with my Temper, that is to &s;ay, the Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I was under, and of which I have &s;aid &s;o much, that I told him in few Words, if he agreed with the Merchants, I would go with him: But I told him, I would not promi&s;e to go any farther than my
<PB N="12" REF="21">
own I&s;land. Why Sir, &s;ays he, you don't want to be left there again, I hope? Why, &s;aid I, can you not take me up again in your Return? He told me, it could not be po&s;&s;ible, that the Mer|chants would allow him to come that Way with a loaden Ship of &s;uch value, it being a Month's Sail out of his Way, and might be three or four: Be&s;ides, Sir, if I &s;hould mi&s;carry, &s;aid he, and not return at all, then you would be ju&s;t reduced to the Condition you were in before.</P>
<P>This was very rational; but we both found out a Remedy for it, which was to carry a framed Sloop on board the Ship, which being taken in Pie|ces, and &s;hipp'd on board the Ship, might by the Help of &s;ome Carpenters, who we agreed to carry with us, be &s;et up again in the I&s;land, and fini&s;h'd, fit to go to Sea in a few Days.</P>
<P>I was not long re&s;olving; for indeed the Impor|tunities of my Nephew join'd in &s;o effectually with my Inclination, that nothing could oppo&s;e me: On the other hand, my Wife being dead, I had no Body concern'd them&s;elves &s;o much for me, as to per&s;uade me one way or other, except my ancient good Friend the Widow, who earne&s;tly &s;truggled with me to con&s;ider my Years, my ea&s;y Circum&s;tances, and the needle&s;s Hazards of a long Voyage; and above all, my young Children: But it was all to no Purpo&s;e, I had an irre&s;i&s;tible De|&s;ire to the Voyage; and I told her, I thought there was &s;omething &s;o uncommon in the Impre&s;&s;ions I had upon my Mind for the Voyage, that it would be a kind of re&s;i&s;ting Providence, if I &s;hould attempt to &s;tay at Home; after which, &s;he ceas'd her Expo&s;tulations, and join'd with me, not only in making Provi&s;ion for my Voyage, but
<PB N="13" REF="22">
al&s;o in &s;ettling my Family Affairs for my Ab|&s;ence, and providing for the Education of my Chil|dren.</P>
<P>In Order to this, I made my Will, and &s;ettled the E&s;tate I had, in &s;uch a Manner for my Chil|dren, and placed in &s;uch Hands, that I was per|fectly ea&s;y and &s;atisfy'd they would have Ju&s;tice done them, whatever might befal me; and for their Education, I left it wholly to my Widow, with a &s;ufficient Maintenence to her &s;elf for her Care: All which &s;he richly de&s;erv'd; for no Mo|ther could have taken more Care in their Edu|cation, or under&s;tand it better; and as &s;he liv'd 'till I came Home, I al&s;o liv'd to thank her for it.</P>
<P>My Nephew was ready to &s;ail about the Be|ginning of <HI>January</HI> 1694-5, and I with my Man <HI>Friday</HI> went on board in the <HI>Downs</HI> the 8th, hav|ing be&s;ides that Sloop which I mention'd above, a very con&s;iderable Cargo of all Kinds of nece&s;|&s;ary Things for my Colony, which if I did not find in good Condition, I re&s;olv'd to leave &s;o.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I carry'd with me &s;ome Servants, who I purpos'd to place there, as Inhabitants, or at lea&s;t to &s;et on Work there upon my own Account while I &s;tay'd, and either to leave them there, or carry them forward as they &s;hould appear wil|ling; particularly, I carry'd two Carpenters, a Smith, and a very handy ingenious Fellow, who was a Cooper by Trade but was al&s;o a gene|ral Mechanick; for he was dextrous at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to grind Corn, was a good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker; he al&s;o made any Thing that was proper to make of
<PB N="14" REF="23">
Earth, or of Wood; in a Word, we call'd him <HI>Our Jack of all Trades.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e I carry'd a Taylor, who had offer'd him&s;elf to go Pa&s;&s;enger to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> with my Nephew, but afterwards con&s;ented to &s;tay on our New Plantation, and prov'd a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary handy Fellow, as could be de&s;ir'd, in many other Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, be&s;ides that of this Trade; for as I ob|&s;erv'd formerly, Nece&s;&s;ity arms us for all Employ|ments.</P>
<P>My Cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept an Account of the Particulars, con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ufficient Quantity of Linnen, and &s;ome thin <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stuffs for cloathing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that I ex|pected to find there, and enough of them, as by my Calculation might comfortably &s;upply them for &s;even Years; if I remember right, the Mate|rials I carry'd for cloathing them with, Gloves, Hats, Shoes, Stockings, and all &s;uch Things as they could want for wearing, amounted to above 200 Pounds, including &s;ome Beds, Bedding, and Hou&s;hold-Stuff, particularly Kitchen-Uten|&s;ils, with Pots, Kettles, Peuter, Bra&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and near a hundred Pound more in Iron-Work, Nails, Tools of every Kind, Staples, Hooks, Hinges, and every nece&s;&s;ary Thing I could think of.</P>
<P>I carry'd al&s;o an hundred &s;pare Arms, Muskets, and Fuzees, be&s;ides &s;ome Pi&s;tols, a con&s;iderable Quantity of Shot of all Sizes, and two Pieces of Bra&s;s Cannon; and becau&s;e I knew not what Time, and what Extremities I was providing for, I car|ry'd an hundred Barrels of Powder, be&s;ides Swords, Cutla&s;&s;es, and the Iron Part of &s;ome Pikes, and Halberts; &s;o that in &s;hort we had a large Maga|zine
<PB N="15" REF="24">
of all Sorts of Stores; and I made my Ne|phew carry two &s;mall Quarter-Deck Guns more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, if their was Occa&s;ion; that when we came there, we might build a Fort, and man it again&s;t all Sorts of Enemies: And indeed, I at fir&s;t thought there was Need enough for it all, and much more, if we hop'd to maintain our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land, as &s;hall be &s;een in the Cour&s;e of that Story.</P>
<P>I had not &s;uch bad Luck in this Voyage as I had been u&s;ed to meet with; and therefore &s;hall have the le&s;s Occa&s;ion to interrupt the Reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how Mat|ters went with my Colony; yet &s;ome odd Acci|dents, cro&s;s Winds, and bad Weather happen'd, on this fir&s;t &s;etting out, which made the Voyage longer than I expected it at fir&s;t; and I who had never made but one Voyage, <HI>(viz.) my fir&s;t Voyage to Guinea,</HI> in which I might be &s;aid to come back again, as the Voyage was at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd, began to think the &s;ame ill Fate &s;till attended me; and that I was born to be never contented with being on Shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at Sea.</P>
<P>Contrary Winds fir&s;t put us to the Northward, and we were oblig'd to put in at <HI>Galway</HI> in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> where we lay Wind-bound two and twen|ty Days; but we had this Satisfaction with the Di&s;a&s;ter, that Provi&s;ions where here exceeding cheap, and in the utmo&s;t Plenty; &s;o that while we lay here, never touch'd the Ship's Stores, but rather added to them; here al&s;o I took in &s;e|veral live Hogs, and two Cows, and Calves, which I re&s;olv'd, if I had a good Pa&s;&s;age, to put on Shore in my I&s;land, but we found Occa&s;ion to di&s;po&s;e otherwi&s;e of them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25">
We &s;at out the 5th of <HI>February</HI> from <HI>Ireland</HI> and had a very fair Gale of Wind for &s;ome Days, as I remember, it might be about the 20th of <HI>Febru|ary</HI> in the Evening late, when the Mate having the Watch, came into the Round-hou&s;e, and told us, he &s;aw a Fla&s;h of Fire, and heard a Gunfir'd, and while he was telling us of it, a Boy came in, and told us the Boat&s;wain heard another. This made us all run out upon the Quarter-Deck, where for a while we heard nothing, but in a few Minutes we &s;aw a very great Light, and found that there was &s;ome very terrible Fire at a Di|&s;tance; immediately we had Recour&s;e to our Rec|konings, in which we all agreed, that there could be no Land that Way, in which the Fire &s;hew'd it &s;elf, no not for 500 Leagues, for it appear'd at W.N.W. Upon this we concluded it mu&s;t be &s;ome Ship on Fire at Sea; and as by our hearing the Noi&s;e of Guns ju&s;t before, we concluded it could not be far off: We &s;tood directly towards it, and were pre&s;ently &s;atisfy'd we &s;hould di&s;cover it, becau&s;e the farther we &s;ail'd, the greater the Light appear'd tho' the Weather being haizy, we could not perceive any Thing but the Light for a while; in about half an Hour's Sailing, the Wind being fair for us, tho' not much of it, and the Weather clearing up a little, we could plainly di&s;cern that it was a great Ship on fire in the Middle of the Sea.</P>
<P>I was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible touch'd with this Di&s;a&s;ter tho' not at all acquainted with the Per&s;ons engag'd in it; I pre&s;ently recollected my former Circum|&s;tances, and in what Condition I was in, when taken up by the <HI>Portugal</HI> Captain; and how much
<PB N="17" REF="26">
more deplorable the Circum&s;tances of the poor Creatures belonging to this Ship mu&s;t be, if they had no other Ship in Company with them: Upon this, I immediately order'd, that five Guns &s;hould be fir'd, one &s;oon after another, that, if po&s;&s;ible, we might give Notice to them, that there was Help for them at hand, and that they might en|deavour to &s;ave them&s;elves in their Boat; for tho' we could &s;ee the Flame of the Ship, yet they, it being Night, could &s;ee nothing of us.</P>
<P>We lay by &s;ome Time upon this, only driving as the burning Ship drove, waiting for Day-Light; when, on a &s;udden, to our great Terror, tho' we had Rea&s;on to expect it, the Ship blew up in the Air; and immediately, that is to &s;ay, in a few Minutes, all the Fire was out, that is to &s;ay, the re&s;t of the Ship &s;unk: This was a terrible, and indeed an afflicting Sight, for the Sake of the poor Men, who, I concluded, mu&s;t be either all de&s;troy'd in the Ship, or be in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s in their Boat in the Middle of the Ocean, which at pre&s;ent, by Rea&s;on it was dark, I could not &s;ee: However, to direct them as well as I could, I cau&s;ed Lights to be hung out in all the Parts of the Ship where we could, and which we had Lanthorns for, and kept firing Guns all the Night long, letting them know by this, that there was a Ship not far off.</P>
<P>About 8 Clock in the Morning we di&s;cover'd the Ship's Boats by the Help of our Per&s;pective Gla&s;|&s;es, found there were two of them, both throng'd with People, and deep in the Water: We percei|ved they row'd, the Wind being again&s;t them, that they &s;aw our Ship, and did their utmo&s;t to make us &s;ee them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27">
We immediately &s;pread our Antient to let them know we &s;aw them, and hung a Waft out as a Sig|nal for them to come on Board, and then made more Sail, &s;tanding directly to them. In little more than half an Hour we came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in, being no le&s;s than &s;ixty four Men, Women, and Children; for there were a great many Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we found it was a <HI>French</HI> Mer|chant Ship of 300 Tun, homeward bound from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> in the River of <HI>Canada.</HI> The Ma&s;ter gave us a long Account of the Di&s;tre&s;s of his Ship, how the Fire began in the Steerage by the Negli|gence of the Steer&s;man; but on his crying out for Help, was, as every Body thought, entirely put out, when they found that &s;ome Sparks of the fir&s;t Fire had gotten into &s;ome Part of the Ship, &s;o dif|ficult to come at, that they could not effectually quench it, till getting in between the Timbers, and within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into the Hold, and ma&s;ter'd all the Skill, and all the Application they were able to exert.</P>
<P>They had no more to do then, but to get into their Boats, which to their great Comfort were pretty large, being their Long-Boat, and a great Shalloup, be&s;ides a &s;mall Skiff which was of no great Service to them, other than to get &s;ome fre&s;h Water and Provi&s;ions into her, after they had &s;ecur'd their Lives from the Fire. They had in|deed &s;mall Hope of their Lives by getting into the&s;e Boats at that Di&s;tance from any Land, only as they &s;aid well, that they were e&s;cap'd from the Fire, and had a Po&s;&s;ibility that &s;ome Ship might happen to be at Sea, and might take them in.
<PB N="19" REF="28">
They had Sails, Oars, and a Compa&s;s, and were preparing to make the be&s;t of their Way back to <HI>Newfound-Land,</HI> the Wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an ea&s;y Gale at S.E. by E. They had as much Provi&s;ions and Water, as with &s;paring it &s;o as to be next door to &s;tarving, might &s;upport them about 12 Days; in which, if they had no bad Weather, and no contrary Winds, the Cap|tain &s;aid, he hop'd he might get the Banks of <HI>Newfound-Land,</HI> and might perhaps take &s;ome Fi&s;h to &s;u&s;tain them till they might go on Shore. But there were &s;o many Chances again&s;t them in all the&s;e Ca&s;es; &s;uch as, Storms to over&s;et and foun|der them, Rains and Cold to benumb and peri&s;h their Limbs, contrary Winds to keep them out and &s;tarve them, that it mu&s;t have been next to mira|culous if they had e&s;cap'd.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their Con&s;ultations, every one being hopele&s;s, and ready to de&s;pair, the Captain with Tears in his Eyes told me, they were on a &s;udden &s;urpriz'd with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and after that four more; the&s;e were the five Guns which I cau&s;ed to be fired at fir&s;t &s;eeing the Light: This reviv'd their Hearts, and gave them the Notice, which, <HI>as above,</HI> I de&s;ir'd it &s;hould, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that there was a Ship at hand for their Help.</P>
<P>It was upon the hearing the&s;e Guns, that they took down their Ma&s;ts and Sails; the Sound com|ing from the Windward, they re&s;olv'd to lie by till Morning. Some Time after this, hearing no more Guns, they fir'd three Muskets, one a con|&s;iderable While after another; but the&s;e, the Wind being contrary, we never heard.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29">
Some Time after that again, they were &s;till more agreeably &s;urpriz'd with &s;eeing our Lights, and hearing the Guns, which, as I have &s;aid, I caus'd to be fir'd all the re&s;t of the Night; this &s;et them to work with their Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at lea&s;t, that we might the &s;ooner come up with them; and at la&s;t, to their inex|pre&s;&s;ible Joy, they found we &s;aw them.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s the &s;everal Ge|&s;tures, the &s;trange Exta&s;ies, the Variety of Po|&s;tures which the&s;e poor deliver'd People run into, to expre&s;s the Joy of their Souls at &s;o unexpected a Deliverance; Grief and Fear are ea&s;ily de&s;cribed; Sighs, Tears, Groans, and a very few Motions of the Head and Hands make up the Sum of its Variety: But an Exce&s;s of Joy, a Surprize of Joy has a Thou&s;and Extravagancies in it; there were &s;ome in Tears, &s;ome raging, and tearing them|&s;elves, as if they had been in the greate&s;t Agonies of Sorrow, &s;ome &s;tark-raving and down-right lu|natick, &s;ome ran about the Ship &s;tamping with their Feet, others wringing their Hands; &s;ome were dancing, &s;ome &s;inging, &s;ome laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not able to &s;peak a Word; others &s;ick and vomiting, &s;everal &s;woon|ing, and ready to faint; and a few were Cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, and giving God Thanks.</P>
<P>I would not wrong them neither, there might be many that were thankful afterward, but the Pa&s;&s;ion was too &s;trong for them at fir&s;t, and they were not able to ma&s;ter it, they were thrown into Exta&s;ies and a Kind of Frenzy, and it was but a very few that were compos'd and &s;erious in their Joy.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="30">
Perhaps the Ca&s;e may have &s;ome Addition to it from the particular Circum&s;tance of that Nation they belong'd to, I mean the <HI>French,</HI> who&s;e Tem|per is allow'd to be more volatile, more pa&s;&s;io|nate, and more &s;prightly, and their Spirits more fluid than in other Nations. I am not Philo&s;opher enough to determine the Cau&s;e, but nothing I had ever &s;een before came up to it: The Exta|&s;ies poor <HI>Friday,</HI> my tru&s;ty <HI>Savage,</HI> was in when he found his Father in the Boat, came the neare&s;t to it, and the Surprize of the Ma&s;ter and his two Companions, who I deliver'd from the Villains that &s;et them on Shore in the I&s;land, came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to compare to this, either that I &s;aw in <HI>Friday,</HI> or any where el&s;e in my Life.</P>
<P>It is further ob&s;ervable, that the&s;e Extravagan|cies did not &s;hew them&s;elves in that different Man|ner I have mention'd in different Per&s;ons only: But all the Variety would appear in a &s;hort Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Moments in one and the &s;ame Per&s;on. A Man that we &s;aw this Minute dumb, and as it were &s;tupid and confounded, &s;hould the next Mi|nute be dancing and hallowing like an Antick; and the next Moment be tearing his Hair, or pulling his Clothes to Pieces, and &s;tamping them under his Feet, like a mad Man; a few Moments after that, we &s;hould have him all in Tears, then &s;ick, then &s;wooning, and had not immediate Help been had, would, in a few Moments more have been dead; and thus it was not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the greate&s;t Part of them; and if I remember right, our Surgeon was oblig'd to let above thirty of them Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31">
There were two Prie&s;ts among them, one an old Man, and the other a young Man; and that which was &s;trange&s;t was, that the olde&s;t Man was the wor&s;t. As &s;oon as he &s;et his Foot on board our Ship, and &s;aw him&s;elf &s;afe, he dropt down &s;tone dead, not the lea&s;t Sign of Life could be perceiv'd in him; our Surgeon immediately ap|ply'd proper Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in the Ship that believ'd he was not dead; at length he open'd a Vein in his Arm, having fir&s;t chaff'd and rubb'd the Part &s;o as to warm it as much as po&s;&s;ible: Upon this the Blood which only dropp'd at fir&s;t, flow'd &s;omething free|ly; in three Minutes after, the Man open'd his Eyes, and about a quarter of an Hour after that he &s;poke, grew better, and quite well; after the Blood was &s;topp'd he walk'd about, told us he was perfectly well, took a Dram of Cordial which the Surgeon gave him, and was what we call'd, <HI>Come to him&s;elf;</HI> about a quarter of an Hour after they came running into the Cabin to the Surgeon, who was bleeding a <HI>French</HI> Woman, that had fainted; and told him, the Prie&s;t was gone &s;tark|mad; it &s;eems he had begun to revolve the Change of his Circum&s;tance, and again this put him into an Exta&s;y of Joy, his Spirits whirl'd about fa&s;ter than the Ve&s;&s;els could convey them; the Blood grew hot and feveri&s;h, and the Man was as fit for <HI>Bedlam,</HI> as any Creature that ever was in it; the Surgeon would not bleed him again in that Condition, but gave him &s;omething to do&s;e and put him to &s;leep, which after &s;ome Time opera|ted upon him, and he wak'd the next Morning perfectly compos'd, and well.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="32">
The younger Prie&s;t behav'd with great Com|mand of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and was really an Example of a &s;erious well-govern'd Mind; at his fir&s;t com|ing on board the Ship, he threw him&s;elf flat on his Face, pro&s;trating him&s;elf in Thankfulne&s;s for his Deliverance, in which I unhappily and un&s;ea&s;ona|bly di&s;turb'd him, really thinking he had been in a Swoon; but he &s;pake calmly, thank'd me, told me, he was giving God Thanks for his Delive|rance, and begg'd me to leave him a few Moments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me Thanks al&s;o.</P>
<P>I was heartily &s;orry, that I di&s;turb'd him, and not only left him, but kept others from interrup|ting him al&s;o; he continued in that Po&s;ture about three Minutes, or little more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had &s;aid he would, and with a great deal of Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Affection, but with Tears in his Eyes, thank'd me that had un|der God, given him and &s;o many mi&s;erable Crea|tures their Lives: I told him, I had no Room to move him to thank God for it, rather than me: But I added, That it was nothing but what Rea|&s;on and Humanity dictated to all Men, and that we had as much Rea&s;on as he to give Thanks to God, who had ble&s;s'd us &s;o far as to make us the In&s;tru|ments of his Mercy to &s;o many of his Creatures.</P>
<P>After this, the young Prie&s;t apply'd him&s;elf to his Country-Folks, labour'd to compo&s;e them; per&s;waded, entreated, argued, rea&s;on'd with them, and did his utmo&s;t to keep them within the Exer|ci&s;e of their Rea&s;on; and with &s;ome he had Suc|ce&s;s, tho' others were for a Time out of all Go|vernment of them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="33">
I cannot help committing this to Writing, as perhaps it may be u&s;eful to tho&s;e into who&s;e Hands it may fall, for the guiding them&s;elves in all the Extravagances of their Pa&s;&s;ions; for if an Exce&s;s of Joy can carry Men out to &s;uch a Length beyond the Reach of their Rea&s;on, what will not the Ex|travagancies of Anger, Rage, and a provok'd Mind carry us to? and indeed here I &s;aw Rea&s;on for keeping an exceeding Watch over our Pa&s;&s;ions of every Kind, as well tho&s;e of Joy and Satisfaction, as tho&s;e of Sorrow and Anger.</P>
<P>We were &s;omething di&s;ordered by the&s;e Extra|vagancies among our new Gue&s;ts for the fir&s;t Day, but when they had been retir'd, Lodgings provi|ded for them as well as our Ship would allow, and they had &s;lept heartily, as mo&s;t of them did, they were quite another Sort of People the next Day.</P>
<P>Nothing of good Manners or civil Acknowledg|ments for the Kindne&s;s &s;hewn them was wanting; the <HI>French,</HI> 'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that Way. The Captain and one of the Prie&s;ts came to me the next Day, and de&s;iring to &s;peak with me and my Nephew, the Commander, began to con&s;ult with us what &s;hould be done with them; and fir&s;t they told us, that as we had &s;aved their Lives, &s;o all they had was little enough for a Return to us for that Kindne&s;s received. The Captain &s;aid, they had &s;aved &s;ome Money and &s;ome Things of Value in their Boats, catch'd ha|&s;tily out of the Flames, and if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an Offer of it all to us; they only de&s;ired to be &s;et on Shore &s;ome|where
<PB N="25" REF="34">
in our Way, where if po&s;&s;ible they might get Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>My Nephew was for accepting their Money at fir&s;t Word, and to con&s;ider what to do with them afterwards; but I over-rul'd him in that Part, for I knew what it was to be &s;et on Shore ina &s;trange Country; and if the <HI>Portugal</HI> Captain that took me up at Sea had &s;erv'd me &s;o, and took all I had for my Deliverance, I mu&s;t have &s;tarv'd, or have been as much a Slave at the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> as I had been in <HI>Barbary,</HI> the meer being &s;old to a <HI>Ma|hometan</HI> excepted; and perhaps a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> is not much a better Ma&s;ter than a <HI>Turk,</HI> if not in &s;ome Ca&s;es a much wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I therefore told the <HI>French</HI> Captain that we had taken them up in their Di&s;tre&s;s, it was true; but that it was our Duty to do &s;o as we were Fellow-Creatures, and as we would de&s;ire to be &s;o deli|ver'd if we were in the like or any other Extremity; that we had done nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us, if we had been in their Ca&s;e, and they in ours; but that we took them up to &s;ave them, not to plunder them; and it would be a mo&s;t barbarous thing to take that little from them which they &s;aved out of the Fire, and then &s;et them on Shore and leave them; that this would be fir&s;t to &s;ave them from Death, and then kill them our &s;elves; &s;ave them from drowning, and abandon them to &s;tarving; and therefore I would not let the lea&s;t thing be taken from them: As to &s;etting them on Shore, I told them indeed that was an exceeding Difficulty to us, for that the Ship was bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and tho' we were driven out of our Cour&s;e to the We&s;tward a very great Way, and perhaps was di|rected

by Heaven on Purpo&s;e for their Deliverance, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible for us wilfully to change our Voyage on this particular Account, nor could my Nephew, the Captain, an&s;wer it to the Freighters, with whom he was under Charter-Party to pur|&s;ue his Voyage by the Way of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and all I knew we could do for them, was to put our &s;elves in the Way of meeting with other Ships homeward bound from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and get them Pa&s;&s;age; if po&s;&s;ible, to <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of the Propo&s;al was &s;o generous and kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but they were in a very great Con&s;ternation, e&s;pecially the Pa&s;&s;engers, at the Notion of being carry'd away to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and they then en|treated me, that &s;eeing I was driven &s;o far to the We&s;tward, before I met with them, I would at lea&s;t keep on the &s;ame Cour&s;e to the Banks of <HI>New|found-Land,</HI> where it was probable I might meet with &s;ome Ship or Sloop that they might hire to carry them back to <HI>Canada,</HI> from whence they came.</P>
<P>I thought this was but a rea&s;onable Reque&s;t on their Part, and therefore I enclin'd to agree to it; for indeed I con&s;ider'd, that to carry this whole Company to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> would not only be an intolerable Severity upon the poor People, but would be ruining our whole Voyage by devouring all our Provi&s;ions; &s;o I thought it no Breach of Charter-Party, but what an unfore&s;een Accident made ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to us, and in which no one could &s;ay we were to blame; for the Laws of God and Nature would have forbid that we &s;hould refu&s;e to take up two Boats full of People in &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;s'd Condition, and the Nature of

the Thing as well re&s;pecting our &s;elves as the poor People, oblig'd us to &s;et them on Shore &s;ome where or other for their Deliverance; &s;o I con|&s;ented that we would carry them to <HI>Newfound-Land,</HI> if Wind and Weather would permit, and if not, that I would carry them to <HI>Martinico</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Wind continued fre&s;h Ea&s;terly, but the Weather pretty good, and as the Winds had con|tinued in the Points between N.E. and S.E. a long time, we mi&s;&s;ed &s;everal Opportunities of &s;ending them to <HI>France;</HI> for we met &s;everal Ships bound to <HI>Europe,</HI> whereof two were <HI>French</HI> from St. <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI>'s, but they had been &s;o long beating up again&s;t the Wind, that they dur&s;t take in no Pa&s;&s;engers for fear of wanting Provi&s;ions for the Voyage, as well for them&s;elves as for tho&s;e they &s;hould take in; &s;o we were obliged to go on. It was about a Week after this that we made the Banks of <HI>Newfound-Land,</HI> where to &s;horten my Sto|ry, we put all our <HI>French</HI> People on Board a Bark, which they hir'd at Sea there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards to carry them to <HI>France</HI> if they could get Provi&s;ion to victual them&s;elves with. When, I &s;ay, all the <HI>French</HI> went on Shore, I &s;hould remember that the young Prie&s;t I &s;poke of, hear|ing we were bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> de&s;ired to go the Voyage with us, and to be &s;et on Shore on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully lik'd the Man, and had very good Rea&s;on, as will appear afterwards; al&s;o four of the Seamen entered them&s;elves on our Ship, and proved very u&s;eful Fellows.</P>
<P>From hence we directed our Cour&s;e for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;teering away S. and S. by E. for about
<PB N="28" REF="37">
twenty Days together, &s;ometimes little or no Wind at all, when we met with another Subject for our Humanity to work upon, almo&s;t as deplo|rable as that before.</P>
<P>It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes North, and the 19th Day of <HI>March</HI> 1694-5, when we '&s;py'd a Sail, our Cour&s;e S.E. and by S. we &s;oon perceiv'd it was a large Ve&s;&s;el, and that &s;he bore up to us, but could not at fir&s;t know what to make of her, till after coming a little nearer, we found &s;he had lo&s;t her Main-top-ma&s;t, Fore|ma&s;t and Bolt&s;prit, and pre&s;ently &s;he fired a Gun as a Signal of Di&s;tre&s;s; the Weather was pretty good, Wind at N.N.W. a fre&s;h Gale, and we &s;oon came to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>We found her a Ship of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> bound home from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> but had been blown out of the Road at <HI>Barbadoes</HI> a few Days before &s;he was rea|dy to &s;ail, by a terrible Hurricane, while the Cap|tain and Chief Mate were both gone on Shore, &s;o that be&s;ide the Terror of the Storm, they were but in an indifferent Ca&s;e for good Arti&s;ts to bring the Ship home: They had been already nine Weeks at Sea, and had met with another terrible Storm after the Hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their Knowledge to the We&s;tward, and in which they lo&s;t their Ma&s;ts, as above; they told us they expected to have &s;een the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands, but were then driven away again to the South Ea&s;t by a &s;trong Gale of Wind at N.N.W. the &s;ame that blew now, and having no Sails to work the Ship with but a main Cour&s;e, and a kind of &s;quare Sail upon a Jury Fore-ma&s;t, which they had &s;et up, they could not lye near
<PB N="29" REF="38">
the Wind, but were endeavouring to &s;tand away for the <HI>Canaries.</HI></P>
<P>But that which was wor&s;t of all, was, that they were almo&s;t &s;tarv'd for want of Provi&s;ions, be&s;ides the Fatigues they had undergone; their Bread and Fle&s;h was quite gone, they had not one Ounce left in the Ship, and had had none for eleven Days; the only Relief they had, was, their Water was not all &s;pent, and they had about half a Barrel of Flower left; they had Sugar enough; &s;ome Suc|cades or Sweet-meats they had at fir&s;t, but they were devour'd, and they had &s;even Casks of Rum.</P>
<P>There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid-Servant on Board, who were going Pa&s;&s;engers, and thinking the Ship was ready to &s;ail, unhappi|ly came on Board the Evening before the Hurri|cane began, and having no Provi&s;ions of their own left, they were in a more deplorable Condition than the re&s;t, for the Seamen being reduced to &s;uch an extreme Nece&s;&s;ity them&s;elves, had no Compa&s;&s;ion, we may be &s;ure, for the poor Pa&s;&s;engers, and they were indeed in a Condition that their Mi&s;ery is very hard to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>I had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Cu|rio&s;ity had not led me, the Weather being fair and the Wind abated, to go on Board the Ship: The Second Mate who upon this Occa&s;ion command|ed the Ship, had been on Board our Ship, and he told me me indeed they had three Pa&s;&s;engers in the great Cabin, that they were in a deplorable Con|dition; nay, &s;ays he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two Days, and I was afraid to enquire after them, &s;aid he, for I had nothing to relieve them with.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="39">
We immediately apply'd our &s;elves to give them what Relief we could &s;pare; and indeed I had &s;o far over-ruled Things with my Nephew, that I would have victuall'd them, tho' we had gone away to <HI>Virginia,</HI> or any Part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> to have &s;upply'd our &s;elves, but there was no Nece&s;&s;ity for that.</P>
<P>But now they were in a new Danger; for they were afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave them; the Mate or Commander brought &s;ix Men with him in his Boat, but the&s;e poor Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and were &s;o weak, they could hardly &s;it to their Oars: The Mate him&s;elf was very ill, and half &s;tarv'd; for he de|clar'd he had re&s;erv'd nothing from the Men, and went Share and Share alike with them in every Bit they eat.</P>
<P>I caution'd him to eat &s;paringly, but &s;et Meat before him immediately, and he had not eaten three Mouthfuls before he began to be Sick, and out of Order; &s;o he &s;topt a while, and our Sur|geon mix'd him up &s;omething with &s;ome Broth, which he &s;aid would be to him both Food and Phy&s;ick; and after he had taken it, he grew bet|ter: In the mean Time, I forgot not the Men; I order'd Victuals to be given them, and the poor Creatures rather devour'd than eat it; they were &s;o exceeding hungry, that they were in a kind ra|venous, and had no Command of them&s;elves; and two of them eat with &s;o much Greedine&s;s, that they were in Danger of their Lives the next Morning.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="40">
The Sight of the&s;e Peoples Di&s;tre&s;s was very moving to me, and brought to Mind what I had a terrible Pro&s;pect of at my fir&s;t coming on Shore in the I&s;land, where I had neither the lea&s;t Mouth|ful of Food, or any Pro&s;pect of procuring any; be|&s;ides the hourly Apprehen&s;ion I had of being made the Food of other Creatures: But all the while the Mate was thus relating to me the mi&s;erable Con|dition of the Ship's Company, I could not put out of my Thought the Story he had told me of the three poor Creatures in the Great Cabin, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Mother, her Son, and the Maid-&s;ervant, who he had heard nothing of for two or three Days, and who he &s;eem'd to confe&s;s they had wholly ne|glected, their own Extremities being &s;o great; by which I under&s;tood, that they had really given them no Food at all, and that therefore they mu&s;t be peri&s;h'd, and be all lying dead perhaps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin.</P>
<P>As I therefore kept the Mate, who we then cal|led Captain, on board with his Men to refre&s;h them, &s;o I al&s;o forgot not the &s;tarving Crew that were left on board, but order'd my own Boat to go on board the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and four or five Pieces of Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charg'd the Men to cau&s;e the Meat to be boil'd while they &s;tay'd, and to keep Guard in the Cook-Room, to prevent the Men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the Pot before it was well boil'd, and then to give every Man but a very little at a Time; and by this Caution he pre&s;erv'd the Men, who would otherwi&s;e ha' kill'd them&s;elves with that very Food that was given them on Purpo&s;e to &s;ave their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="41">
At the &s;ame Time, I order'd the Mate to go into the Great Cabin, and &s;ee what Condition the poor Pa&s;&s;engers were in, and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what Refre&s;h|ment was proper; and the Surgeon gave him a large Pitcher with &s;ome of the prepar'd Broth which he had given the Mate that was on board, and which he did not que&s;tion would re&s;tore them gradually.</P>
<P>I was not &s;atisfy'd with this, but as I &s;aid a|bove, having a great Mind to &s;ee the Scene of Mi|&s;ery, which I knew the Ship it&s;elf would pre&s;ent me with, in a more lively Manner than I could have it by Report, I took the Captain of the Ship, as we now call'd him, with me, and went my&s;elf a little after in their Boat.</P>
<P>I found the poor Men on board almo&s;t in a Tu|mult to get the Victuals out of the Boyler before it was ready: But my Mate ob&s;erv'd his Order, and kept a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door, and the Man he plac'd there, after u&s;ing all po&s;&s;i|ble Per&s;wa&s;ion to have Patience, kept them off by Force: However, he cau&s;ed &s;ome Bisket Cakes to be dipp'd in the Pot, and &s;often'd with the Liquor of the Meat, which they call Brews, and gave them every one, one, to &s;tay their Stomachs, and told them it was for their own Safety that he was oblig'd to give them but a little at a Time: But it was all in vain; and had I not come on board, and their own Commander and Officers with me, and with good Words, and &s;ome Threats al&s;o of giving them no more, I believe they would have broke into the Cook-Room by Force, and tore the Meat out of the Furnace: For Words
<PB N="33" REF="42">
are indeed of very &s;mall Force to a hungry Belly: However we pacify'd them, and fed them gradu|ally and cautiou&s;ly for the fir&s;t Time, and the next Time gave them more, and at la&s;t fill'd their Bel|lies, and the Men did well enough.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;ery of the poor Pa&s;&s;engers in the Cabin, was of another Nature, and far beyond the re&s;t; for as fir&s;t the Ship's Company had &s;o little for them&s;elves, it was but too true that they had at fir&s;t kept them very low, and at la&s;t total|ly neglected them; &s;o that for &s;ix or &s;even Days, it might be &s;aid, they had really had no Food at all, and for &s;everal Days before very little. The poor Mother, who as the Men reported, was a Woman of good Sen&s;e and good Breeding, had &s;par'd all &s;he could get, &s;o affectionately for her Son, that at la&s;t &s;he entirely &s;unk under it: And when the Mate of our Ship went in, &s;he &s;at upon the Floor or Deck, with her Back up again&s;t the Sides, between two Chairs, which were la&s;h'd fa&s;t, and her Head &s;unk in between her Shoulders, like a Corp&s;e, tho' not quite dead. My Mate &s;aid all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a Spoon put &s;ome Broth into her Mouth; &s;he o|pen'd her Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could not &s;peak; yet &s;he under&s;tood what he &s;aid, and made Signs to him, intimating, that it was too late for her, but pointed to her Child, as if &s;he would have &s;aid, they &s;hould take Care of him.</P>
<P>However, the Mate, who was exceedinglymov'd with the Sight, endeavour'd to get &s;ome of the Broth into her Mouth; and as he &s;aid, got two or three Spoonfuls down, tho' I que&s;tion whether he could be &s;ure of it or not: But it was too late, and &s;he dy'd the &s;ame Night.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="43">
The Youth who was pre&s;erved at the Price of his mo&s;t affectionate Mother's Life, was not &s;o far gone, yet he lay in a Cabin bed as one &s;tre ch'd out, with hardly any Life left in him; he had a Piece of an old Glove in his Mouth, having eaten up the re&s;t of it; however, being young, and having more Strength than his Mother, the Mate got &s;omething down his Throat, and he began &s;en|&s;ibly to revive, tho' by giving him &s;ome time after but two or three Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very &s;ick, and brought it up again.</P>
<P>But the next Care was the poor Maid, &s;he lay all along upon the Deck hard by her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and ju&s;t like one that had fallen down with an A|poplexy and &s;truggled for Life: Her Limbs where di&s;torted, one of her Hands was cla&s;p'd round the Frame of a Chair, and &s;he grip'd it &s;o hard, that we could not ea&s;ily make her let go; her other Arm lay over her Head, and her Feet lay both together &s;et fa&s;t again&s;t the Frame of the Cabin Table; in &s;hort, &s;he lay ju&s;t like one in the la&s;t Agonies of Death, and yet &s;he was alive too.</P>
<P>The poor Creature was not only &s;tarv'd with Hunger, and terrify'd with the Thoughts of Death, but as the Men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;he &s;aw dy|ing for two or three Days before, and who &s;he lov'd mo&s;t tenderly.</P>
<P>We knew not what to do with this poor Girl, for when our Surgeon, who was a Man of very great Knowledge and Experience, had with great Application recover'd her as to Life; he had her upon his Hand as to her Sen&s;es, for &s;he was lit|tle
<PB N="35" REF="44">
le&s;s than di&s;tracted for a con&s;iderable Time af|ter, as &s;hall appear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Whoever &s;hall read the&s;e <HI>Memorandums</HI> mu&s;t be de&s;ir'd to con&s;ider, that Vi&s;its at Sea are not like a Journey into the Country, where &s;ometimes Peo|ple &s;tay a Week or a Fortnight at a Place. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to relieve this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ship's Crew, but not to lie by for them; and tho' they were willing to &s;teer the &s;ame Cour&s;e with us for &s;ome Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace with a Ship that had no Ma&s;ts; however, as their Captain begg'd of us to help him to &s;et up a Main-Top-Ma&s;t, and a Kind of a Top-Ma&s;t to his Jury Fore-Ma&s;t. We did, as it were lie by him for three or four Days, and then having given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork, two Hog|&s;heads of Bisket, and a Proportion of Peas, Flour, and what other Things we could &s;pare; and taking three Casks of Sugar, &s;ome Rum, and &s;ome Pieces of Eight of them for Satisfaction, we left them, taking on board with us, at their own ear|ne&s;t Reque&s;t, the Prie&s;t, the Youth, and the Maid, and all their Goods.</P>
<P>The young Lad was about &s;eventeen Years of Age, a pretty, well-bred mode&s;t, and &s;en&s;ible Youth, greatly dejected with the Lo&s;s of his Mo|ther, and as it &s;eems had lo&s;t his Father but a few Months before at <HI>Berbadoes.</HI> He begg'd of the Surgeon to &s;peak to me to take him out of the Ship, for he &s;aid the cruel Fellows had murther'd his Mother; <HI>and indeed &s;o they had,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>pa&s;&s;ively;</HI> for they might ha' &s;par'd a &s;mall Su&s;te|nance to the poor helple&s;s Widow, that might have pre&s;erv'd her Life, tho' it had been but ju&s;t to keep her alive. But Hunger knows no Friend,
<PB N="36" REF="45">
no Relation, no Ju&s;tice, no Right, and therefore is remor&s;ele&s;s, and capable of no Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it would carry him away from all his Friends, and put him perhaps in as bad Circum|&s;tances almo&s;t as tho&s;e we found him in; that is to &s;ay, &s;tarving in the World. He &s;aid he matter'd not whether he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible Crew he was among: That the Captain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of my Nephew) had &s;av'd his Life, and he was &s;ure would not hurt him; and as for the Maid, he was &s;ure if &s;he came to her&s;elf, &s;he would be very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The Surgeon repre&s;ented the Ca&s;e &s;o affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we took them both on board with all their Goods, except eleven Hog&s;heads of Sugar, which could not be removed or come at, and as the Youth had a Bill of Lading for them, I made his Commander &s;ign a Writing, obliging him&s;elf to go as &s;oon as he came to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to one Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> a Mer|chant there, to whom the Youth &s;aid he was re|lated, and to deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the Goods he had belonging to the decea&s;ed Widow; which I &s;uppo&s;e was not done, for I could never learn that the Ship came to <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> but was, as is mo&s;t probable, lo&s;t at Sea, be|ing in &s;o di&s;abled a Condition and &s;o far from a|ny Land, that I am of Opinion, the fir&s;t Storm &s;he met with afterwards, &s;he might founder in the Sea, for &s;he was leaky, and had Damage in her Hold when we met with her.</P>
<P>I was now in the Latitude of 19 Deg. 32 Min. and had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to
<PB N="37" REF="46">
Weather, tho' at fir&s;t the Winds had been con|trary. I &s;hall trouble no Body with the little In|cidents of Wind, Weather, Currents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on the re&s;t of our Voyage; but &s;hortning my Story for the &s;ake of what is to follow, &s;hall ob&s;erve that I came to my old Habitation, the I&s;land, on the 10th of <HI>April</HI> 1695. It was with no &s;mall Difficul|ty that I found the Place; for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the South and Ea&s;t Side of the I&s;land, as coming from the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> &s;o now coming in between the Main and the I&s;land, and having no Chart for the Coa&s;t, nor any Land-Mark, I did not know it when I &s;aw it, or know whether I &s;aw it or no.</P>
<P>We beat about a great while, and went on Shore on &s;everal I&s;lands on the Mouth of the great River <HI>Oronooque,</HI> but none for my Purpo&s;e. Only this I learn'd by my Coa&s;ting the Shore, that I was under one great Mi&s;take before, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Continent which I thought I &s;aw, from the I&s;land I liv'd in, was really no Continent, but a long I&s;land, or ra|ther a Ridge of I&s;lands, reaching from one to the other Side of the extended Mouth of that great River, and that the Savages who came to my I&s;land, were not properly tho&s;e which we call <HI>Ca|ribbees,</HI> but I&s;landers, and other Barbarians of the &s;ame Kind, who inhabited &s;omething nearer to our Side than the re&s;t,</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I vi&s;ited &s;everal of the&s;e I&s;lands to no Purpo&s;e; &s;ome I found were inhabited, and &s;ome were not. On one of them I found &s;ome <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and thought they had liv'd there, but &s;peaking with them, found they had a Sloop lay in a &s;mall Creek hard by, and they came thither to make Salt, and to catch &s;ome Pearl Mu&s;sles if they
<PB N="38" REF="47">
could, but that they belong'd to the I&s;le <HI>de Trini|dad,</HI> which lay farther North in the Latitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> and 11 Degrees.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t coa&s;ting from one I&s;land to another, &s;ometimes with the Ship, &s;ometimes with the <HI>French</HI> Mans Shalloup, which we had found a con|venient Boat, and therefore kept her with their very good Will; at length I came fair on the South Side of my I&s;land, and I pre&s;ently knew the very Countenance of the Place; &s;o I brought the Ship &s;afe to an Anchor, Broad&s;ide with the little Creek where was my old Habitation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I &s;aw the Place, I call'd for <HI>Friday,</HI> and ask'd him if he knew where he was? He look'd about a little, and pre&s;ently clapping his Hands, cry'd; <HI>O yes, O there, O yes, O there,</HI> pointing to our old Habitation, and fell a dan|cing and capering like a mad Fellow, and I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea, to &s;wim a&s;hore to the Place.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Friday,</HI> &s;ays I, do you think we &s;hall find any Body here or no? And what do you think, &s;hall we &s;ee your Father? The Fellow &s;tood mute as a Stock a good while, but when I nam'd his Father, the poor affectionate Creature look'd de|jected, and I could &s;ee the Tears run down his Face very plentifully. What is the Matter, <HI>Fri|day,</HI> &s;ays I? Are you troubled becau&s;e you may &s;ee your Father? No, no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;haking his Head, no &s;ee him more, no ever more &s;ee again; <HI>why &s;o,</HI> &s;aid I <HI>Friday, how do you know that?</HI> O no, O no, &s;ays <HI>Friday.</HI> he long ago die, long ago; he much old Man. Well, well, <HI>&s;ays I, Fri|day,</HI> you don't know; but &s;hall we &s;ee any one
<PB N="39" REF="48">
el&s;e then? The Fellow, it &s;eems, had better Eyes than I, and he points ju&s;t to the Hill above my old Hou&s;e; and tho' we lay half a League off, he cries out, we &s;ee! we &s;ee! yes, we &s;ee much Men there, and there, and there. I look'd, but I could &s;ee no body, no not with a Per&s;pective Gla&s;s, which was, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e I could not hit the Place, for the Fellow was right, as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and there was five or &s;ix Men altogether, &s;tood to look at the Ship, not knowing what to think of us.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Friday</HI> had told me he &s;aw People, I caus'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Antient to be &s;pread, and fir'd three Guns, to give them Notice we were Friends, and in about half a Quarter of an Hour after, we perceiv'd a Smoke ri&s;e from the Side of the Creek, &s;o I immediately order'd a Boat out, taking <HI>Fri|day</HI> with me, and hanging out a white Flag, or Flag of Truce, I went directly on Shore, taking with me the young Fryer I mention'd, to whom I had told the whole Story of my living there, and the manner of it, and every Particular both of my &s;elf, and tho&s;e I left there; and who was on that Account extremely de&s;irous to go with me. We had be&s;ides about &s;ixteen Men very well arm'd, if we had found any new Gue&s;ts there which we did not know of; but we had no Need of Weapons.</P>
<P>As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood, near high Water, we row'd directly into the Creek, and the fir&s;t Man I fix'd my Eye upon, was the <HI>Spa|niard</HI> whole Life I had &s;av'd, and who I knew by his Face perfectly well; as to his Habit I &s;hall de|&s;cribe it afterwards. I order'd no body to go on Shore at fir&s;t but my &s;elf, but there was no keep|ing
<PB N="40" REF="49">
<HI>Friday</HI> in the Boat; for the affectionate Crea|ture had &s;py'd his Father at a Di&s;tance, a good Way off of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where indeed I &s;aw no|thing of him; and if they had not let him go on Shore, he would have jump'd into the Sea. He was no &s;ooner on Shore, but he flew away to his Father like an Arrow out of a Bow. It would have made any Man have &s;hed Tears in Spight of the firme&s;t Re&s;olution, to have &s;een the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of this poor Fellow's Joy when he came to his Fa|ther; how he embrac'd him, ki&s;s'd him, &s;trok'd his Face, took him up in his Arms, &s;et him down upon a Tree, and lay down by him, then &s;tood and look'd at him, as any one would look at a &s;trange Picture for a Quarter of an Hour toge|ther; then lye down on the Ground, and &s;troke his Legs, and ki&s;s them, and then get up again, and &s;tare at him; one would ha' thought the Fellow bewitch'd: But it would ha' made a Dog laugh to &s;ee how the next Day his Pa&s;&s;ion run out another Way: In the Morning he walk'd along the Shore, to and again, with his Father &s;everal Hours, always leading him by the Hand, as if he had been a Lady; and every now and then he would come to fetch &s;omething or other for him to the Boat, either a Lump of Sugar, or a Dram, a Bi&s;|ket Cake, or &s;omething or other that was good. In the Afternoon his Frolicks run another Way; for then he would &s;et the old Man down upon the Ground, and dance about him, and make a Thou&s;and antick Po&s;tures and Ge&s;tures; and all the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and telling him one Story or another of his Tra|vels, and of what had happen'd to him Abroad, to divert him. In &s;hort, if the &s;ame filial Affecti|on was to be found in Chri&s;tians to their Parents, in our Part of the World, one would be tempted
<PB N="41" REF="50">
to &s;ay, there would hardly ha' been any Need of the fifth Commandment.</P>
<P>But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion; I return to my Lan|ding. It would be endle&s;s to take Notice of all the Ceremonies and Civilities that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> receiv'd me with. The fir&s;t <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who, as I &s;aid, I knew very well, was he who&s;e Life I had &s;av'd; he came towards the Boat, attended by one more, carrying a Flag of Truce al&s;o; and he did not only not know me at fir&s;t, but he had no Thoughts, no Notion of its being me that was come, till I &s;poke to him: Seignior, &s;aid I in <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI> Do you not know me? At which he &s;poke not a Word; but giving his Musket to the Man that was with him, threw his Arms abroad, and &s;aying &s;omething in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> that I did not perfectly hear, comes forward, and embrac'd me, telling me he was inexcu&s;able, not to know that Face again, that he had once &s;een, as of an Angel from Hea|ven &s;ent to &s;ave his Life: He &s;aid Abundance of very hand&s;ome Things, as a well bred <HI>Spaniard</HI> al|ways knows how; and then beckoning to the Per|&s;on that attended him, bad him go and call out his Comerades. He then ask'd me, if I would walk to my old Habitation, where he would give me Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of my own Hou&s;e again, and where I &s;hould &s;ee there had been but mean Improvements; &s;o I walk'd along with him; but alas I could no more find the Place again, than if I had never been there; for they had planted &s;o many Trees, and plac'd them in &s;uch a Po&s;ture, &s;o thick and clo&s;e to one another; and in ten Years Time they were grown &s;o big, that <HI>in &s;hort</HI> the Place was inacce&s;&s;ible, ex|cept by &s;uch Windings and blind Ways, as they them&s;elves only, who made them, could find.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51">
I ask'd them what put them upon all the&s;e For|tifications? He told me, I would &s;ay there was Need enough of it, when they had given me an Account how they had pa&s;s'd their Time &s;ince their Arriving in the I&s;land, e&s;pecially after they had the Misfortune to find that I was gone: He told me, he could not but have &s;ome Satisfaction in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone away in a good Ship, and to my Satisfaction; and that he had often-times a &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion, that one Time or other he &s;hould &s;ee me again: But no|thing that ever befel him in his Life, he &s;aid, was &s;o &s;urprizing and afflicting to him at fir&s;t, as the Di&s;appointment he was under when he came back to the I&s;land, and found I was not there.</P>
<P>As to the three <HI>Barbarians</HI> (&s;o he call'd them) that were left behind, and of whom he &s;aid he had a long Story to tell me; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> all thought them&s;elves much better among the Savages, only that their Number was &s;o &s;mall. And, &s;ays he, had they been &s;trong enough, we had been all long ago in Purgatory; and with that he cro&s;s'd him|&s;elf on the Brea&s;t: But Sir, &s;ays he, I hope you will not be di&s;pleas'd, when I &s;hall tell you how forc'd by Nece&s;&s;ity we were oblig'd, for our own Pre&s;erva|tion to di&s;arm them, and make them our Subjects, who would not be content with being moderately our Ma&s;ters, but would be our Murtherers. I an|&s;wer'd, I was heartily afraid of it when I left them there; and nothing troubled me at my par|ting from the I&s;land, but that they were not come back, that I might have put them in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every Thing fir&s;t, and left the other in a State of Subjection, as they de&s;erv'd: But if they had re|duc'd them to it, I was very glad, and &s;hould be
<PB N="43" REF="52">
very far from finding any Fault with it; for I knew they were a Parcel of refractory, ungovern'd Vil|lains, and were fit for any Manner of Mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>While I was &s;aying this, came the Man whom he had &s;ent back, and with him eleven Men more: In the Dre&s;s they were in, it was impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s what Nation they were of: But he made all clear both to them and to me. Fir&s;t he turn'd to me, and pointing, to them, &s;aid, The&s;e, Sir, are &s;ome of the Gentlemen who owe their Lives to you; and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon which they all came up one by one, not as if they had been Sailors and ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but really, as if they had been Amba&s;&s;adors of Noblemen, and I a Monarch or a great Conqueror; their Behaviour was to the la&s;t Degree obliging and courteous, and yet mix'd with a Manly, Maje&s;tick Gravity, which very well became them; and in &s;hort, they had &s;o much more Manners than I, that I &s;carce knew how to receive their Civilities, much le&s;s how to return them in Kind.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of their coming to, and Conduct in the I&s;land, after my going away, is &s;o very re|markable, and has &s;o many Incidents, which the former Part of my Relation will help to under&s;tand, and which will in mo&s;t of the Particulars, refer to that Account I have already given, that I cannot but commit them with great Delight to the rea|ding of tho&s;e that come after me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall no longer trouble the Story with a Re|lation in the fir&s;t Per&s;on, which will put me to the Expence of ten Thou&s;and <HI>&s;aid I's,</HI> and <HI>&s;aid he's,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="53">
and he <HI>told me's,</HI> and I <HI>told him's,</HI> and the like, but I &s;hall collect the Facts Hi&s;torically, as near as I can gather them out of my Memory from what they related to me, and from what I met with in my conver&s;ing with them and with the Place.</P>
<P>In order to do this &s;uccinctly, and as intelligi|bly as I can, I mu&s;t go back to the Circum&s;tance in which I left the I&s;land, and in which the Per|&s;ons were of whom I am to &s;peak. And fir&s;t it is nece&s;&s;ary to repeat, that I had &s;ent away <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the two who&s;e Lives I had re&s;cued from the Savages, I &s;ay, I had &s;ent them away in a large Canoe to the Main, <HI>as I then thought it,</HI> to fetch over the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Com|panions who he had left behind him, in order to &s;ave them from the like Calamity that he had been in; and in order to &s;uccour them for the pre&s;ent, and that if po&s;&s;ible, we might together find &s;ome Way for our Deliverance afterward.</P>
<P>When I &s;ent them away, I had no vi&s;ible Ap|pearance of, or the lea&s;t Room to hope for my own Deliverance any more than I had twenty Year be|fore, much le&s;s had I any Fore knowledge of what afterward happened, I mean of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship coming on Shore there to fetch me off; and it could not but be a very great Surprize to them when they came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find three Strangers left on the Spot, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all that I had left behind me, which would otherwi&s;e have been their own.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing, however, which I enquir'd into, that I might begin where I left off, was of their own Part; and I de&s;ir'd he would give me a particular Account of his Voyage back to his
<PB N="45" REF="54">
Countrymen with the Boat, when I &s;ent him to fetch them over. He told me there was little Va|riety in that Part, for nothing remarkable hap|pen'd to them on the Way, they having very calm Weather, and a &s;mooth Sea; for his Countrymen it could not be doubted, he &s;aid, but that they were overjoy'd to &s;ee him: (It &s;eems he was the principal Man among them, the Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el they had been &s;hipwreck'd in, having been dead &s;ome Time) they were, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> the more &s;urprized to &s;ee him, becau&s;e they knew that he was fallen into the Hands of the Savages, who, they were &s;atisfy'd, would devour him as they did all the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners, that when he told them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manner he was furni&s;h'd for carrying them away, it was like a Dream to them; and their A&s;toni&s;h|ment, they &s;aid, was &s;omething like that of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Brethren, when he told them who he was, and told them the Story of his Exaltation in <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Court: But when he &s;hewed them the Arms, the Powder, the Ball, and the Provi&s;ions that he brought them for their Journey or Voyage, they were re&s;tor'd to them&s;elves, took a ju&s;t Share of the Joy of their Deliverance, and immediately prepar'd to come away with him.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s was to get Canoes; and in this they were obliged not to &s;tick &s;o much upon the hone&s;t Part of it, but to tre&s;pa&s;s upon their friendly Savages, and to borrow two large Canoes or Periagua's, on Pretence of going out a Fi&s;hing, or for Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the&s;e they came away the next Morning; it &s;eems they wanted no Time to get them&s;elves rea|dy; for they had no Baggage, neither Clothes or
<PB N="46" REF="55">
Provi&s;ions, or any Thing in the World, but what they had on them, and a few Roots to eat, of which they u&s;ed to make their Bread.</P>
<P>They were in all three Weeks ab&s;ent, and in that Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occa|&s;ion offer'd for my E&s;cape, as I mention'd in my other Part, and to get off from the I&s;land, lea|ving three of the mo&s;t impudent, harden'd, ungo|vern'd, di&s;agreeable Villains behind me, that any Man could de&s;ire to meet with, to the poor <HI>Spa|niards</HI> great Grief and Di&s;appointment, you may be &s;ure.</P>
<P>The only ju&s;t Thing the Rogues did, was, That when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came on Shore, they gave my Letter to them, and gave them Provi|&s;ions and other Relief, as I had ordered them to do; al&s;o they gave them the long Paper of Di|rections which I had left with them, containing the particular Methods which I took for manag|ing every Part of my Life there, the Way how I baked my Bread, bred up tame Goats, and plant|ed my Corn, how I cur'd my Grapes, made my Pots, and, in a Word, every Thing I did, all this being written down, they gave to the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> two of whom under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> well enough; nor did they refu&s;e to accommodate the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with every Thing el&s;e, for they a|greed very well for &s;ome Time; they gave them an equal Admi&s;&s;ion into the Hou&s;e, or Cave, and they began to live very &s;ociably, and the Head <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who had &s;een pretty much of my Me|thods, and <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father together, manag'd all their Affairs; for, as for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, they did nothing but ramble about the I&s;land, &s;hoot Parrots, and catch Tortoi&s;es, and when they
<PB N="47" REF="56">
came home at Night, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> provided their Suppers for them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have been &s;atisfy'd with this, would the other but have let them alone, which, however, they could not find in their Hearts to do long; but, like the Dog in the Man|ger, they would not eat them&s;elves, and would not let others eat neither: The Differences, never|thele&s;s, were at fir&s;t but trivial, and &s;uch as are not worth relating; but at la&s;t, it broke out in|to open War, and it begun with all the Rudene&s;s and In&s;olence that can be imagin'd, without Rea|&s;on, without Provocation, contrary to Nature, and indeed, to common Sen&s;e; and tho' it is true the fir&s;t Relation of it came from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves, who I may call the Accu&s;ers, yet when I came to examine the Fellows, they could not de|ny a Word of it.</P>
<P>But before I come to the Particulars of this Part, I mu&s;t &s;upply a Defect in my former Relation, and this was, that I forgot to &s;et down among the re&s;t, that ju&s;t as we were weighing the An|chor to &s;et Sail, there happen'd a little Quarrel on board our Ship, which I was afraid once would have turn'd to a &s;econd Mutiny; nor was it appeas'd, till the Captain rouzing up his Cou|rage, and taking us all to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, parted them by Force, and making two of the mo&s;t re|fractory Fellows Pri&s;oners, he laid them in Irons, and as they had been active in the former Di&s;or|ders, and let fall &s;ome ugly dangerous Words the &s;econd Time, he threaten'd to carry them in I|rons to <HI>England,</HI> and have them hang'd there for Mutiny, and running away with the Ship.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="57">
This, it &s;eems, tho' the Captain did not intend to do it, frighted &s;ome other Men in the Ship, and &s;ome of them had put it into the Heads of the re&s;t, that the Captain only gave them good Words for the pre&s;ent, till they &s;hould come to &s;ome <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Port, and that then they &s;hould be all put in|to Jayl, and try'd for their Lives.</P>
<P>The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquain|ted us with it; upon which it was de&s;ir'd, that I, who &s;till pa&s;s'd for a great Man among them; &s;hould go down with the Mate, and &s;atisfy the Men, and tell them, that they might be a&s;&s;ur'd, if they behav'd well the re&s;t of the Voyage, all they had done for the Time pa&s;t &s;hould be par|don'd. So I went, and after pa&s;&s;ing <HI>my Honour</HI>'s Word to them, they appear'd ea&s;y; and the more &s;o, when I cau&s;ed the two Men, who were in Irons, to be relea&s;ed and forgiven.</P>
<P>But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that Night, the Wind al&s;o falling calm, next Morning we found, that our two Men who had been laid in Irons, had &s;tole each of them a Mu&s;|ket, and &s;ome other Weapons, what Powder or Shot they had, we know not; and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which was not yet ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">'d up, and ran away with her to their Companions in Roguery on Shore.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat on Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and away they went to &s;eek the Rogues, but they could neither find them, or any of the re&s;t; for they all fled into the Woods when they &s;aw the Boat coming on Shore. The Mate was once re|&s;olv'd, in Ju&s;tice to their Roguery, to have de|&s;troy'd
<PB N="49" REF="58">
their Plantations, burnt all their Hou&s;hold-Stuff and Furniture, and left them to &s;hift with|out it; but having no Order, he let it all alone, left every Thing as they found it, and bringing the Pinnace away, came on board without them.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Men made their Number five, but the other three Villains were &s;o much wickeder than the&s;e, that after they had been 2 or 3 Days together, they turn'd their two New-Comers out of Doors to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and would have nothing to do with them, nor could they for a good while be per&s;waded to give them any Food; as for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> they were not yet come.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came fir&s;t on Shore, the Bu|&s;ine&s;s began to go forward; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have per&s;uaded the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Brutes to have taken in their two Countrymen again, that, as they &s;aid, they might be all one Family; but they would not hear of it: So the two poor Fellows liv'd by them&s;elves, and finding nothing but Indu&s;try and Application would make them live comfortably, they pitch'd their Tents on the <HI>North</HI> Shore of the I&s;land, but a little more to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> to be out of the Danger of the Savages, who always landed on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Parts of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay up their Magazines and Stores in, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having given them &s;ome Corn for Seed, and e&s;pecially &s;ome of the Peas which I had left them, they dug, and plant|ed, and enclo&s;ed, after the Pattern I had &s;et for them all, and began to live pretty well; their fir&s;t Crop of Corn was on the Ground, and tho' it was but a little Bit of Land which they had dug up at
<PB N="50" REF="59">
fir&s;t, having had but a little Time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them with Bread and other Eatables; and one of the Fellows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship, was very ready at making Soup, Puddings, and &s;uch other Prepara|tions, as the Rice, and the Milk, and &s;uch little Fle&s;h as they got, furni&s;h'd him to do.</P>
<P>They were going on in this little thriving Po|&s;ture, when the three unnatural Rogues, their own Country men too, in meer Humour, and to in&s;ult them, came and bully'd them, and told them, the I&s;land was theirs, that the Governor, mean|ing me, had given them Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and no Body el&s;e had any Right to it, and damn 'em, they &s;hould build no Hou&s;es upon their Ground, unle&s;s they would pay them Rent for them.</P>
<P>The two Men thought they had je&s;ted at fir&s;t, ask'd them to come in and &s;it down, and &s;ee what fine Hou&s;es they were that they had built, and tell them what Rent they demanded, and one of them merrily told them, if they were Ground-Landlords, he hoped, if they built Tenements upon their Land, and made Improvements, they would, according to the Cu&s;tom of Landlords, grant them a long Lea&s;e, and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to draw the Writings. One of the three damning and raging, told them, they &s;hould &s;ee they were not in Je&s;t, and going to a little Place at a Di&s;tance, where the hone&s;t Men had made a Fire to dre&s;s their Victuals, he takes a Fire-brand, and claps it to the Out-&s;ide of their Hut, and very fairly &s;et it on Fire, and it would have been all burnt down in a few Minutes, if one of the two had not run to the Fellow, thru&s;t him
<PB N="51" REF="60">
away, and trod the Fire out with his Feet, and that not without &s;ome Difficulty too.</P>
<P>The Fellow was in &s;uch a Rage at the hone&s;t Man's thru&s;ting him away, that he return'd upon him with a Pole he had in his Hand, and had not the Man avoided the Blow very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he had ended his Days at once; his Comerade &s;eeing the Danger they were both in, run in after him, and immediately they came both out with their Muskets, and the Man that was fir&s;t &s;truck at with the Pole, knock'd the Fellow down that begun the Quarrel, with the Stock of his Musket, and that before the other two could come to help him, and then &s;eeing the re&s;t come at them, they &s;tood together, and pre&s;enting the other Ends of their Pieces to them, bad them &s;tand off.</P>
<P>The other had Fire-Arms with them too, but one of the two hone&s;t Men, bolder than his Come|rade, and made de&s;perate by his Danger, told them, if they offer'd to move Hand or Foot they were dead Men, and boldly commanded them to lay down their Arms. They did not indeed lay down their Arms, but &s;eeing him &s;o re&s;olute, it brought them to a Parley, and they con&s;ented to take their wounded Man with them, and be gone; and indeed it &s;eems the Fellow was wounded &s;uffici|ently with the Blow; however, they were much in the wrong, &s;ince they had the Advantage, that they did not di&s;arm them effectually, as they might have done, and have gone immediately to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and given them an Account how the Rogues had treated them; for the three Vil|lains &s;tudied nothing but Revenge, and every Day gave them &s;ome Intimation that they did &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="61">
But not to crow'd this Part with an Ac|count of the le&s;&s;er Part of their Rogueries, &s;uch as treading down their Corn, &s;hooting three young Kids, and a She-Goat, which the poor Men had got to breed up tame for their Store; and, in a word, plaguing them Night and Day in this Man|ner, it forced the two Men to &s;uch a De&s;peration, that they re&s;olv'd to fight them all three the fir&s;t Time they had a fair Opportunity; in Order to this they re&s;olv'd to go the Ca&s;tle, as they call'd it, that was my old Dwelling, where the three Rogues and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> all liv'd together, at that Time intending to have a fair Battle, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould &s;tand by to &s;ee fair Play; &s;o they got up in the Morning before Day, and came to the Place, and call'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men by their Names, telling a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that an&s;wer'd, that that they wanted to &s;peak with them.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that the Day before two of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having been in the Woods, had &s;een one of the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who, for Di&s;tinction, I call the <HI>Hone&s;t Men,</HI> and he had made a &s;ad Com|plaint to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of the barbarous U&s;age they had met with from their three Countrymen, and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and de&s;troy'd their Corn, that they had labour'd &s;o hard to bring forward, and kill'd the Milch-Goat and their three Kids, which was all they had pro|vided for their Su&s;tenance, and that if he and his Friends, meaning the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> did not a&s;&s;i&s;t them again, they &s;hould be &s;tarved. When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came home at Night, and they were all at Supper, he took the Freedom to reprove the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, tho' in very gentle and mannerly Terms, and ask'd them, How they could be &s;o

cruel, they being harmle&s;s inoffen&s;ive Fellows, and that they were only putting them&s;elves in a way to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by their Labour, and that it had co&s;t them a great deal of Pains to bring things to &s;uch Perfection as they had?</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men return'd very brisk|ly, what had they to do there? That they came on Shore without Leave, and they &s;hould not Plant or Build upon the I&s;land, it was none of their Ground.

The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man an&s;wer'd, the I&s;land was theirs, the Governour had given it to them, and no Man had any thing to do there but them&s;elves; and with that &s;wore by his Maker, that they would go and burn all their new Huts, they &s;hould build none upon their Land.</P>
<P>Why, Seignior, &s;ays the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> by the &s;ame Rule we mu&s;t be your Servants too? Ay, &s;ays the bold Dog, and &s;o you &s;hall too, before we have done with you, mixing two or three G-d Damme's in the proper Intervales of his Speech; the <HI>Spaniard</HI> only &s;mil'd at that, and made him no An&s;wer: However, this little Di&s;cour&s;e had heated them, and &s;tarting up, one &s;ays to the other, I think it was he they call'd <HI>Will.

us go and have t'other Bru&s;h with them; we'll demoli&s;h their Ca&s;tle, I'll warrant you, they &s;hall plant no Colony in our Dominions.</P>
<P>Upon this, they went all Trooping away, with every Man a Gun, a Pi&s;tol, and a Sword, and mutter'd &s;ome in&s;olent Things among them|&s;elves of what they would do to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> too, when Opportunity offer'd, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> it &s;eems did not &s;o perfectly under&s;tand them, as to know all the Particulars, only, that in gene|ral, they threatned them hard for taking the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mens Part.</P>
<P>Whether they went, or how they be&s;tow'd their time that Evening, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;aid, they did not know; but it &s;eems they wandred about the Country, Part of the Night, and then lying down in the Place which I u&s;ed to call my Bower, they were weary, and over-&s;lept them&s;elves. The Ca&s;e was this, they had re|&s;olv'd to &s;tay till Mid-night, and &s;o to take the two poor Men when they were a&s;leep, and as they acknowledg'd afterwards, intended to &s;et Fire to their Huts while they were in them, and either burn them in them, or murder them as they came out, and as Malice &s;eldom &s;leeps very &s;ound, it was very &s;trange they &s;hould not have been kept waking.</P>
<P>However, as the two Men had al&s;o a De&s;ign upon them, as I have &s;aid, tho' a much fairer one than that of Burning and Murthering, it hap|pen'd, and very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad, before the bloody-mind|ed Rogues came to their Huts.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="64">
When they came there and found the Men gone, <HI>Atkins,</HI> who it &s;eems was the forwarde&s;t Man, call'd out to his Comerades, ha <HI>Jack,</HI> here's the Ne&s;t, but D....n 'em the Birds are flown; they mu&s;ed a while to think what &s;hould be the Occa&s;ion of their being gone abroad &s;o &s;oon, and &s;ugge&s;ted pre&s;ently that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had gi|ven them Notice of it, and with that they &s;hook Hands, and &s;wore to one another that they would be reveng'd of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> As &s;oon as they had made this bloody Bargain they fell to work with the poor Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s Habitation, they did not &s;et Fire indeed to any thing, but they pull'd down: both their little Hou&s;es, and pull'd them &s;o Limb from Limb, that they left not the lea&s;t Stick &s;tanding, or &s;carce any Sign on the Ground where they &s;tood; they tore all their little col|lected Hou&s;hould Stuff in Pieces, and threw eve|ry Thing about in &s;uch a manner, that the poor Men afterwards found &s;ome of their Things a Mile off their Habitation.</P>
<P>When they had done this, they pull'd up all the young Trees the poor Men had planted, pull'd up an Enclo&s;ure they had made to &s;ecure their Cattle and their Corn; and in a word, &s;ack'd and plunder'd every thing, as compleatly as a Hoord of <HI>Tartars</HI> would have done.</P>
<P>The two Men were at this Juncture gone to find them out, and had re&s;olved to fight them where|ever they had been, tho' they were but two to three: So that had they met, there certainly would have been Blood &s;hed among them, for they were all very &s;tout re&s;olute Fellows, to give them their due.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="65">
But Providence took more Care to keep them a&s;&s;under, than they them&s;elves could do to meet; for, as if they had dogg'd one another, when the three were gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards when the two went back to find them, the three were come to the old Habita|tion again; we &s;hall &s;ee their differing Conduct pre&s;ently. When the three came back like furi|ous Creatures flu&s;h'd with the Rage which the Work they had been about had put them into, they came up to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and told them what they had done, by way of Scoff and Bra|vado; and one of them &s;tepping up to one of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as if they had been a Couple of Boys at Play, takes hold of his Hat, as it was upon his Head, and giving it a Twirl about, fleering in his Face, &s;ays he to him, <HI>And you,</HI> Seignior, Jack Spaniard, <HI>&s;hall have the &s;ame Sauce, if you do not mend your Manners:</HI> The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who tho' a quiet civil Man, was as brave as a Man could be de&s;ir'd to be, and withal a &s;trong well-made Man, look'd &s;teadily at him for a good while, and then having no Weapon in his Hand, &s;lept gravely up to him, and with one Blow of his Fi&s;t knock'd him down, as an Ox is fell'd with a Pole-Axe; at which one of the Rogues, in&s;olent at the fir&s;t, fir'd his Pi&s;tol at the <HI>Spaniard</HI> immediately; he mi&s;s'd his Body indeed, for the Bullets went thro' his Hair, but one of them touch'd the tip of his Ear, and he bled pretty much. The Blood made the <HI>Spa|niard</HI> believe, he was more hurt then he really was, and that put him into &s;ome Heat, for be|fore, he acted all in a perfect Calm; but now re&s;olving to go thro' with his Work, he &s;toop'd to take the Fellow's Musket who he had knock'd
<PB N="57" REF="66">
down, and was ju&s;t going to &s;hoot the Man, and had fir'd at him, when the re&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being in the Cave came out, and calling to him not to &s;hoot, they &s;tept in, &s;ecur'd the other two, and took their Arms from them.</P>
<P>When they were thus di&s;arm'd, and found they had made all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> their Enemies, as well as their own Countrymen, they began to cool, and giving the <HI>Spaniards</HI> better Words, would have had their Arms again; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> con&s;idering the Feud that was between them and the other two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and that it would be the be&s;t Method they could take to keep them from one another, told them, they would do them no harm, and if they would live peace|ably, they would be very willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;ociate with them, as they did before; but that they could not think of giving them their Arms again, while they appear'd &s;o re&s;olv'd to do Mi&s;|chief with them to their own Countrymen, and had even threatned them all, to make them their Servants.</P>
<P>The Rogues were now no more capable to hear Rea&s;on, than to act Rea&s;on, and being re|fus'd their Arms, they went raving away and raging like mad Men, threatning what they would do, tho' they had no Fire-Arms. But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> de&s;pi&s;ing their Threatning, told them they &s;hould take Care how they offer'd a|ny Injury to their Plantation or Cattle, for if they did, they would &s;hoot them as they would do ravenous Bea&s;ts, wherever they found them; and if they fell into their Hands alive, they &s;hould certainly be hang'd. However, this was far from cooling them, but away they went
<PB N="58" REF="67">
raging and &s;wearing like Furies of Hell. As &s;oon as they were gone, came back the two Men in Pa&s;&s;ion and Rage enough al&s;o, tho' of another Kind; for having been at their Plantation, and finding it all demoli&s;h'd and de&s;troy'd, as above, it will ea&s;ily be &s;uppos'd they had Provocation e|nough; they could &s;carce have Room to tell their Tale, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;o eager to tell them theirs; and it was &s;trange enough to find three Men thus bully nineteen, and receive no Puni&s;hment at all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> indeed de&s;pi&s;ed them, and e&s;pe|cially having thus di&s;arm'd them, made light of all their Threatnings; but the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men re&s;olv'd to have their Remedy again&s;t them, what Pain &s;oever it co&s;t to find them out.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> interpos'd here too, and told them, that as they had di&s;arm'd them, they could not con&s;ent that they (the Two) &s;hould pur&s;ue them with Fire-Arms and perhaps kill them; but &s;aid the grave <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who was their Go|vernour, we will endeavour to make them do you Ju&s;tice if you will leave it to us, for as there is no doubt but they will come to us again when their Pa&s;&s;ion is over, being not able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we promi&s;e you to make no Peace with them, without having a full Sati&s;|faction for you; upon this Condition we hope you will promi&s;e to u&s;e no Violence with them, other than in your own Defence.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men yielded to this very awkardly, and with great Reluctance, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> prote&s;ted, they did it only to keep

them from Blood&s;hed, and to make all ea&s;y at la&s;t; for &s;aid they, we are not &s;o many of us, here is Room enough for us all, and it is great pity we &s;hould not be all good Friends; at length they did con&s;ent, and waited for the I&s;&s;ue of the Thing, living for &s;ome Days with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for their own Habitation was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>In about five Days Time the three Vagrants, tir'd with Wandring, and almo&s;t &s;tarv'd with Hunger, having chiefly liv'd on Turtles Eggs all that while, came back to the Grove, and find|ing my <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who, as I have &s;aid, was the Governour, and two more with him walking by the Side of the Creek; they came up in a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive humble Manner, and begg'd to be receiv'd again into the Family. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> u&s;ed them civilly, but told them, they had acted &s;o unnaturally by their Countrymen, and &s;o very gro&s;sly by them (the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) that they could not come to any Conclu&s;ion without con&s;ulting the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men and the re&s;t; but however, they would go to them and di&s;cour&s;e about it, and they &s;hould know in half an Hour. It may de gue&s;s'd, that they were very hard put to it, for it &s;eems, as they were to wait this half Hour for an An|&s;wer, they begg'd they would &s;end them out &s;ome Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and &s;ent them at the &s;ame Time a large Piece of Goats Fle&s;h, and a broil'd Parrot, which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry enough.</P>
<P>After half an Hour's Con&s;ultation they were call'd in, and a long Debate had among them, their two Countrymen charging them with the
<PB N="60" REF="69">
Ruin of all their Labour, and a De&s;ign to murther them; all which they own'd before, and therefore could not deny now; upon the whole, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> acted the Moderator between them, and as they had oblig'd the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men not to hurt the three while they were naked and un|arm'd, &s;o they now oblig'd the three to go and build their Fellows two Huts, one of the &s;ame, and the other of larger Dimen&s;ions, than they were before; to fence their Ground again where they had pull'd up the Fences, plant Trees in the Room of tho&s;e pull'd up, dig up the Land again for planting Corn, where they had &s;poil'd it; and in a Word, to re&s;tore every Thing in the &s;ame State as they found it, as near as they could, for entirely it could not be, the Sea&s;on for the Corn, and the Growth of the Trees, and Hedges, not being po&s;&s;ible to be reco|vered.</P>
<P>Well, they &s;ubmitted to all this, and as they had Plenty of Provi&s;ions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the whole Society began to live plea&s;antly and agreeably together, only that the&s;e three Fellows could ne|ver be per&s;waded to work, I mean for them&s;elves, except now and then a little, ju&s;t as they plea|&s;ed; however, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> told them plainly, that if they would but live &s;ociably and friend|ly together, and &s;tudy in the whole the Good of the Plantation, they would be content to work for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleas'd; and thus having liv'd pret|ty well together for a Month or two, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> gave them Arms again, and give them Liberty to go abroad with them as before.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="70">
It was not above a Week after they had the&s;e Arms, and went abroad, but the ungrateful Crea|tures began to be as in&s;olent and trouble&s;om as be|fore; but however, an Accident happening pre|&s;ently upon this, which endanger'd the Safety of them all, they were oblig'd to lay by all private Re&s;entments, and look to the Pre&s;ervation of their Lives.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Night, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Go|vernour, as I call him, that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who&s;e Life I had &s;av'd, who was now the Cap|tain, or Leader, or Governour of the re&s;t, found him&s;elf very unea&s;y in the Night, and could by no Means get any Sleep; he was perfectly well in Body, as he told me the Story, only found his Thoughts tumultuous, his Mind run upon Men fighting, and killing of one another, but was broad awake, and could not by any Means get any Sleep; in &s;hort, he lay a great while, but growing more and more unea&s;y, he re&s;olv'd to ri&s;e: As they lay, being &s;o many of them, upon Goat-skins, laid thick upon &s;uch Couches and Pads, as they made for them&s;elves, not in Ham|mocks and Ship-Beds, as I did, who was but one, &s;o they had little to do, when they were willing to ri&s;e, but to get up upon their Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, &s;uch as it was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for going any Way that their Thoughts guided them.</P>
<P>Being thus gotten up, he look'd out, but being dark, he could &s;ee little or nothing, and be&s;ides the Trees which I had planted, as in my former Account is de&s;cribed, and which were now
<PB N="62" REF="71">
grown tall intercepted his Sight, &s;o that he could only look up, and &s;ee that it was a clear Star-light Night, and hearing no Noi&s;e, he re|turn'd and laid him down again; but it was all one, he could not &s;leep, nor could he compo&s;e him&s;elf to any Thing like Re&s;t, but his Thoughts were to the la&s;t Degree unea&s;y, and yet he knew not for what.</P>
<P>Having made &s;ome Noi&s;e with ri&s;ing and walking about, going out and coming in, ano|ther of them wak'd, and calling, ask'd, who it was that was up? The Governour told him, how it had been with him. Say you &s;o, &s;ays the other <HI>Spaniard,</HI> &s;uch Things are not to be &s;lighted, I a&s;&s;ure; there is certain|ly &s;ome Mi&s;chief working, &s;ays he, near us, and pre&s;ently he asked him where are the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men? They are all in their Huts, &s;ays he, &s;afe enough. It &s;eems, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had kept Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the main Apartment, and had made a Place where the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, &s;ince their la&s;t Mutiny always quarter'd by them&s;elves, and could not come at the re&s;t. Well, &s;ays the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI> there is &s;omething in it, I am per&s;waded from my own Experience; I am &s;atisfy'd our Spirits embodied have a Conver&s;e with, and receive Intelligence from the Spirits unembodi|ed and inhabiting the invi&s;ible World, and this friendly Notice is given for our Advantage, if we know how to make U&s;e of it. Come, &s;ays he, let us go out and look abroad, and if we find nothing at all in it to ju&s;tify the Trouble, I'll tell you a Story to the Purpo&s;e, that &s;hall convince you of the Ju&s;tice of my propo&s;ing it.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="72">
In a Word, they went out to go to the Top of the Hill, where I us'd to go, but they being &s;trong and in good Company, not alone, as I was, us'd none of my Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pulling it up after them, to go up a &s;econd Stage to the Top, but were go|ing round thro' the Grove unconcern'd and un|weary, when they were &s;urpriz'd with &s;eeing a Light, as of Fire, a very little Way off from them, and hearing the Voices of Men, not of one, or two, but of a great Number.</P>
<P>In all the Di&s;coveries I had made of the Sa|vages landing on the I&s;land, it was my con&s;tant Care to prevent them making the lea&s;t Di&s;co|very of there being any Inhabitant upon the Place; and when by any Occa&s;ion they came to know it, they felt it &s;o effectually, that they that got away, were &s;carce able to give any Ac|count of it, for we di&s;appear'd as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble, nor did ever any that had &s;een me, e&s;cape to tell any one el&s;e, except it was the three Sa|vages in our la&s;t Encounter, who jump'd into the Boat, of whom I mention'd, that I was a|fraid they &s;hould go Home and bring more Help.</P>
<P>Whether it was the Con&s;equence of the E|&s;cape of tho&s;e Men, that &s;o great a Number came now together, or whether they came ig|norantly and by Accident on their u&s;ual bloody Errand, they could not it &s;eems under&s;tand; but whatever it was, it had been their Bu&s;ine&s;s, either to have conceal'd them&s;elves, as not to have &s;een them at all, much le&s;s to have let the Savages have &s;een that there were any In|habitants
<PB N="64" REF="73">
in the Place, or to have fallen upon them &s;o effectually, as that not a Man of them &s;hould have e&s;cap'd, which could only have been by getting in between them and their Boats; but this Pre&s;ence of Mind was wanting to them, which was the Ruin of their Tranquil|lity for a great while.</P>
<P>We need not doubt, but that the Governour and the Man with him, &s;urpriz'd with this Sight, run back immediately, and rais'd their Fellows, giving them an Account of the imminent Danger they were all in; and they again as readily took the Alarm, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;wade them to &s;tay clo&s;e within where they were, but that they mu&s;t run all out to &s;ee how Things &s;tood.</P>
<P>While it was dark indeed, they were well e|nough, and they had Opportunity enough for &s;ome Hours to view them by the Light of three Fires they had made at a Di&s;tance from one a|nother; what they were doing they knew not, and what to do them&s;elves they knew not. For, fir&s;t, the Enemy were too many; and &s;econdly, they did not keep together, but were divided in|to &s;everal Parties, and were on Shore in &s;everal Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in no &s;mall Con&s;ternation at this Sight, and as they found that the Fel|lows ran &s;traggling all over the Shore, they made no Doubt, but fir&s;t or la&s;t, &s;ome of them would chop in upon their Habitation, or upon &s;ome other Place, where they would &s;ee the Token of Inhabitants, and they were in great Perplexity al&s;o for fear of their Flock of Goats,
<PB N="65" REF="74">
which would have been little le&s;s than &s;tarving them, if they would have been de&s;troy'd; &s;o the fir&s;t Thing they re&s;olv'd upon, was to di&s;|patch three Men away before it was light. <HI>viz.</HI> two <HI>Spaniards</HI> and one <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to drive all the Goats away to the great Valley where the Cave was, and if Need were, to drive them in|to the very Cave it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Could they have &s;een the Savages all toge|ther in one Body, and at any Di&s;tance from their Canoes, they re&s;olv'd, if they had been an hundred of them, to have attack'd them; but that could not be obtain'd, for they were &s;ome of them two Miles off from the other, and, as it appear'd afterwards, were of two different Nations.</P>
<P>And after having mu&s;ed a great while on the Cour&s;e they &s;hould take, and beaten their Brains in con&s;idering their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, they re&s;olv'd at la&s;t, while it was dark, to &s;end the old Savage, <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father, out as a Spy, to learn, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;omething concerning them, what they came for, and what they intended to do; the old Man readily undertook it, and &s;tripping him&s;elf quite naked, as mo&s;t of the Savages were, away he went: After he had been gone an Hour or two, he brings Word, that he had been among them undi&s;cover'd, that he found they were two Parties, and of two &s;everal Nations who had War with one another, and had had a great Battle in their own Country, and that both Sides having had &s;everal Pri&s;oners taken in the Fight, they were by meer Chance landed all in the &s;ame I&s;land, for the devouring their Pri&s;oners, and
<PB N="66" REF="75">
making merry; but their coming &s;o by Chance to the &s;ame Place had &s;poil'd all their Mirth; that they were in a great Rage at one another, and that they were &s;o near, that he believ'd they would fight again, as &s;oon as Day-light began to appear; but he did not perceive that they had any Notion of any Body's being on the I&s;land but them&s;elves. He had hardly made an End of telling his Story, when they could perceive, by the unu&s;ual Noi&s;e they made, that the two lit|tle Armies were engag'd in a bloody Fight.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI>'s Father u&s;ed all the Arguments he could to per&s;uade our People to lie clo&s;e, and not be &s;een; he told them their Safety con&s;i&s;ted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie &s;till, and the Savages would kill one another to their Hands, and then the re&s;t would go away; and it was &s;o to a Tittle. But it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevail, e&s;pecially from the <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> their Curio&s;ity was &s;o importunate upon their Pru|dentials, that they mu&s;t run out and &s;ee the Battle: However, they u&s;ed &s;ome Caution too, <HI>(viz.)</HI> they did not go openly, ju&s;t by their own Dwelling, but went farther into the Woods, and plac'd them&s;elves to Advantage, where they might &s;ecurely &s;ee them manage the Fight, and, as they thought, not to be &s;een by them; but it &s;eems the Savages did &s;ee them, as we &s;hall find hereafter.</P>
<P>The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> one of them &s;aid, he could perceive, that &s;ome of them were Men of great Bravery, of invincible Spirits, and of great Policy in guiding the Fight. The Battle, they &s;aid, held two Hours, before they could

gue&s;s which Party would be beaten; but then that Party which was neare&s;t our Peoples Habi|tation began to appear weake&s;t, and after &s;ome Time more, &s;ome of them began to fly; and this put our Men again into a great Con&s;ternation, lea&s;t any of tho&s;e that fled &s;hould run into the Grove, before their Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby involuntarily di&s;cover the Place; and that by Con&s;equence the Pur&s;uers &s;hould do the like in Search for them. Upon this they re|&s;olv'd that they would &s;tand arm'd within the Wall, and whoever came into the Grove, they &s;hould &s;ally out over the Wall and kill them; &s;o that, if po&s;&s;ible, not one &s;hould return to give an Account of it; they order'd al&s;o, that it &s;hould be done with their Swords, or by knock|ing them down with the Stock of the Mu&s;ket, but not by &s;hooting them, for fear of the Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>As they expected, it fell out; three of the routed Army fled for Life, and, cro&s;&s;ing the Creek, ran directly into the Place, not in the lea&s;t knowing whether they went, but running as into a thick Wood for Shelter; the Scout they kept to look Abroad, gave Notice of this with|in, with this Addition, to our Mens great Sati&s;|faction <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Conquerors had not pur|&s;ued them, or &s;een which Way they were gone; upon this, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governour, a Man of Humanity, would not &s;uffer them to kill the three Fugitives, but &s;ending three Men out by the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go round and come in behind them, &s;urprize and take them Pri&s;oners, which-was done; the Re&s;idue of the conquer'd People fled to their Canoes and got off to Sea; the Victors retir'd, and made no

Pur&s;uit or very little, but drawing them&s;elves into a Body together, gave two great &s;kreaming Shouts, which they &s;uppos'd was by way of Tri|umph, and &s;o the Fight ended: And the &s;ame Day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, they al&s;o march'd to their Canoes. And thus the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> had their I&s;land again free to them&s;elves, their Fright was over, and they &s;aw no Savages in &s;everal Years after.</P>
<P>After they were all gone, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came out of their Den, and viewing the Field of Battle, they found about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot; &s;ome were kill'd with great long Ar|rows, &s;ome of which were found &s;ticking in their Bodies; but mo&s;t of them were kill'd with their great wooden Swords, &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen of which they found in the Field of Battle, and as many Bows, with a great many Arrows: The&s;e Swords were &s;trange great unweildy Things, and they mu&s;t be very &s;trong Men that u&s;ed them: Mo&s;t of tho&s;e Men that were kill'd with them, had their Heads ma&s;h'd to pieces, as we may &s;ay, or as we call it in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> their Brains knock'd out, and &s;everal their Arms and Legs broken; &s;o that 'tis evident they fight with inexpre&s;&s;ible Rage and Fury. We found not one wounded Man that was not &s;tone dead; for either they &s;tay by their Enemy till they have quite kill'd him, or they carry all the wounded Men, that are not quite dead, away with them.</P>
<P>This Deliverance tam'd our <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> for a great while; the Sight had fill'd them with Hor|ror, and the Con&s;equences appear'd terrible to the la&s;t Degree, even to them, if ever they &s;hould fall into the Hands of tho&s;e Creatures, who would not
<PB N="69" REF="78">
only kill them as Enemies, but kill them for Food, as we kill our Cattle. And they profe&s;s'd to me, that the Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mutton, tho' it was &s;uppos'd it was not to be till they were dead, had &s;omething in it &s;o hor|rible, that it nau&s;eated their very Stomachs, made them &s;ick when they thought of it, and fill'd their Minds with &s;uch unu&s;ual Terror, that they were not them&s;elves for &s;ome Weeks after.</P>
<P>This, as I &s;aid, tam'd even the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Brutes I have been &s;peaking of; and for a great while after they were very tractable, and went about the common Bu&s;ine&s;s of their whole Society well enough; planted, &s;ow'd, reap'd, and began to be all naturaliz'd to the Country, But &s;ome|time after this, they fell all into &s;uch Mea&s;ures which brought them into a great deal of Trouble.</P>
<P>They had taken three Pri&s;oners, as I had ob|&s;erv'd, and the&s;e three beeing lu&s;ty &s;tout young Fellows, they made them Servants, and taught them to work for them; and, as Slaves, they did well enough; but they did not take their Mea|&s;ures with them as I did by my Man <HI>Friday, viz.</HI> to begin with them upon the Principle of having &s;av'd their Lives, and then in&s;truct them in the rational Principles of Life, much le&s;s of Religion, civilizing and reducing them by kind U&s;age and affectionate Arguings; but as they gave them their Food every Day, &s;o they gave them their Work too, and kept them fully employ'd in Drudgery enough; but they fail'd in this, by it, that they never had them to a&s;&s;i&s;t them and fight for them, as I had my Man <HI>Friday,</HI> who was as true to me as the very Fle&s;h upon my Bones.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="79">
But to come to the Family Part, being all now good Friends; for common Danger, as I &s;aid above, had effectually reconcil d them, they began to con&s;ider their general Circum&s;tances; and the fir&s;t Thing that came under their Con&s;ideration was, Whether, &s;eeing the Savages particularly haunted that Side of the I&s;land, and that there were more remote and retir'd Parts of it equally adapted to their Way of Living, and manife&s;tly to their Advantage, they &s;hould not rather remove their Habitation, and plant in &s;ome more proper Place for their Safety, and e&s;pecially for the Security of their Cattle and Corn?</P>
<P>Upon this, after long Debate, it was conclud|ed, That they would not remove their Habitati|on; becau&s;e, that &s;ome Time or other, they thought they might hear from their Governor again, meaning me; and if I &s;hould &s;end any one to &s;eek them, I &s;hould be &s;ure to direct them to that Side, where, if they &s;hould find the Place demoli&s;h'd, they would conclude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were gone, and &s;o our Sup|ply would go too.</P>
<P>But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to remove them into the Valley where my Cave was, where the Land was as proper for both, and where indeed there was Land enough: However, upon &s;econd Thought, they alter'd one Part of that Re&s;olution too, and re&s;olv'd only to remove Part of their Cattel thither, and plant Part of their Corn there; and &s;o if one Part was de&s;troy'd the other might be &s;av'd: And one Part of Pru|dence they u&s;ed, which it was very well they did, <HI>viz.</HI> That they never tru&s;ted tho&s;e three Sa|vages, which they had Pri&s;oners, with knowing
<PB N="71" REF="80">
anything of the Plantation they had made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they had there; much le&s;s of the Cave there, which they kept, in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, as a &s;afe Retreat, and whither they carry'd al&s;o the two Barrels of Powder, which I had &s;ent them at my coming away.</P>
<P>But however they re&s;olv'd not to change their Habitation, yet they agreed, that as I had care|fully cover'd it fir&s;t with a Wall or Fortification, and then with a Grove of Trees; &s;o, &s;eeing their Safety con&s;i&s;ted entirely in their being conceal'd, of which they were now fully convinc'd; they &s;et to Work to cover and conceal the Place yet more effectually than before: To this Purpo&s;e, as I had planted Trees, (or rather thru&s;t in Stakes, which in Time all grew up to be Trees) for &s;ome good Di|&s;tance before the Entrance into my Apartment, they went on in the &s;ame Manner, and fill'd up the re&s;t of that whole Space of Ground, from the Trees I had &s;et, quite down to the Side of the Creek, where, as I &s;aid, I landed my Floats, and even into the very Ouze where the Tide flow'd, not &s;o much as leaving any Place to land, or any Sign that there had been any Landing there|about: The&s;e Stakes al&s;o, being of a Wood very forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took Care to have generally very much larger and taller than tho&s;e which I had planted; and as they grew apace, &s;o they planted them &s;o ve|ry thick and clo&s;e together, that when they had been three or four Years grown, there was no piercing with the Eye any con&s;iderable Way into the Plantation. And as for that Part which I had planted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Man's Thigh; and among them they placed &s;o many other &s;hort ones, and &s;o thick, that,
<PB N="72" REF="81">
in a Word, it &s;tood like a Palli&s;ado, a quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to penetrate it, but with a little Army to cut it all down; for a little Dog could hardly get between the Trees, they &s;tood &s;o clo&s;e.</P>
<P>But this was not all; for they did the &s;ame by all the Ground to the right Hand, and to the Left, and round even to the Top of the Hill; leaving no Way, not &s;o much as for them&s;elves to come out, but by the Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and then lifted up, and placed again from the fir&s;t Stage up to the Top; which Ladder, when it was taken down, nothing but what had Wings or Witchcraft to a&s;&s;i&s;t it, could come at them.</P>
<P>This was excellently well contriv'd: Nor was it le&s;s than what they afterwards found Occa|&s;ion for; which &s;erv'd to convince me, that as human Prudence has the Authority of Provi|dence to ju&s;tify it, &s;o it has, doubtle&s;s, the Di|rection of Providence to &s;et it to Work; and would we li&s;ten carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully per&s;uaded we might prevent many of the Di&s;a&s;ters which our Lives are now, by our own Negligence, &s;ubjected to. But this by the Way.</P>
<P>I return to the Story. They liv'd two Years after this in perfect Retirement, and had no more Vi&s;its from the Savages: They had, indeed, an Alarm given them one Morning which put them into a great Con&s;ternation; for &s;ome of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being out early one Morning on the We&s;t Side, or rather the End of the I&s;land, which, by the Way, was that End where I never went, for fear of being di&s;cover'd, they were &s;urpriz'd with &s;eeing above twenty Canoes of <HI>Indians,</HI> ju&s;t coming on Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="82">
They made the be&s;t of their Way Home, in Hurry enough; and, giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they kept clo&s;e all that Day and the next, going out only at Night, to make Ob&s;er|vation: But they had the good Luck to be mi|&s;taken; for, wherever the Savages went, they did not land at that Time on the I&s;land, but pur|&s;ued &s;ome other De&s;ign.</P>
<P>And now they had another Broil with the three <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> one of which, a mo&s;t turbulent Fellow, being in a Rage at one of the three Slaves, which I mention'd they had taken, be|cau&s;e the Fellow had not done &s;omething right which he bid him do, and &s;eem'd a little un|tractable in his &s;howing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog Belt, in which he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savage, not to cor|rect him, but to kill him. One of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who was by, &s;eeing him give the Fellow a bar|barous Cut with the Hatchet, which he aim'd at his Head, but &s;truck into his Shoulder, &s;o that he thought he had cut the poor Creature's Arm off, ran to him, and entreating him not to murder the poor Man, clapt in between him and the Savage, to prevent the Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, &s;truck at the <HI>Spaniard</HI> with his Hatchet, and &s;wore he would &s;erve him as he intended to &s;erve the Savage; which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> perceiving, a|voided the Blow; and with a Shovel which he had in his Hand, (for they were all working in the Field about their Corn-Land) knock'd the Brute down: Another of the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> running at the &s;ame Time to help his Comrade, knock'd the
<PB N="74" REF="83">
<HI>Spaniard</HI> down; and then two <HI>Spaniards</HI> more came in to help their Man, and a third <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> fell in upon them. They had none of them any Fire-Arms, or any other Weapons but Hatchers and other Tools, except this third <HI>Engli&s;hman;</HI> he had one of my old ru&s;ty Cutla&s;hes, with which he made at the two la&s;t <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and wounded them both. This Fray &s;et the whole Family in an Up|roar, and more Help coming in, they took the three <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> Pri&s;oners. The next Que&s;tion was, What &s;hould be done with them, they had been &s;o often mutinous, and were &s;o furious, &s;o de&s;perate, and &s;o idle withal, that they knew not what Cour&s;e to take with them; for they were mi&s;chievous to the highe&s;t Degree, and va|lued not what Hurt they did to any Man; &s;o that, in &s;hort, it was not &s;afe to live with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who was Governor, told them in &s;o many Words, That if they had been of his own Country, he would have hang'd them; for all Laws and all Governors were to pre&s;erve So|ciety; and tho&s;e who were dangerous to the So|ciety, ought to be expell'd out of it; but as they were <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and that it was to the generous Kindne&s;s of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> that they all ow'd their Pre&s;ervation and Deliverance, he would u&s;e them with all po&s;&s;ible Lenity, and would leave them to the Judgment of the other two <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who were their Countrymen.</P>
<P>One of the two hone&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> &s;tood up, and &s;aid, they de&s;ir'd it might not be left to them; for, &s;ays he, I am &s;ure we ought to &s;entence them to the Gallows; and with that gives an Account how <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> one of the three, had propo&s;ed to have all the five <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> join together, and mur|der
<PB N="75" REF="84">
all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they were in their Sleep.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor heard this, he calls to <HI>William Atkins,</HI> How, Seignior <HI>Atkins,</HI> &s;ays he, would you murder us all? What have you to &s;ay to that? That harden'd Villain was &s;o far from denying it, that he &s;aid it was true, and G&mdash;d d&mdash;m him they would do it &s;till before they had done with them. Well, but Seignior <HI>Atkins,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> What have we done to you, that you will kill us? And what would you get by killing us? And what mu&s;t we do to pre|vent your killing us? Mu&s;t we kill you, or you will kill us? Why will you put us to the Nece&s;&s;ity of this, Seignior <HI>Atkins,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Spaniard</HI> very calmly and &s;miling.</P>
<P>Seignior <HI>Atkins</HI> was in &s;uch a Rage at the <HI>Spa|niard</HI>'s making a Je&s;t of it, that had he not been held by three Men, and withal had no Weapons with him, it was thought he would have attempt|ed to have kill'd the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in the Middle of all the Company.</P>
<P>This hair-brain'd Carriage oblig'd them to con|&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly what was to be done. The two <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> who &s;av'd the poor Savage, was of the Opinion, they &s;hould hang one of the three for an Example to the re&s;t, and that, particularly, it &s;hould be he that had twice at|tempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet; and indeed there was &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe he had done it, for the poor Savage was in &s;uch a mi|&s;erable Condition with the Wound he had receiv'd, that it was thought he could not live.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="85">
But the Governor <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;till &s;aid No, it was an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> that had &s;av'd all their Lives, and he would never con&s;ent to put an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to Death, tho' he had murder'd half of them, nay, he &s;aid, if he had been kill'd him&s;elf by an <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> and had Time left to &s;peak, it &s;hould be, that they &s;hould pardon him.</P>
<P>This was &s;o po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted on by the Go|vernor <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that there was no gain &s;aying it; and as merciful Councils are mo&s;t apt to prevail where they are &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd, &s;o they all came into it; but then it was to be con&s;ider'd, what &s;hould be done to keep them from doing the Mi&s;chief they de&s;ign'd; for all agreed, Governor and all, that Means were to be u&s;ed for pre&s;erving the Society from Danger; after a long Debate it was agreed, Fir&s;t, That they &s;hould be di&s;arm'd, and not permitted to have either Gun, or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any Weapon, and &s;hould be turn'd out of the Society, and left to live where they would, and how they would, by them|&s;elves; but that none of the re&s;t, either <HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;hould conver&s;e with them, &s;peak with them, or have any Thing to do with them; that they &s;hould be forbid to come within a certain Di&s;tance of the Place where the re&s;t dwelt; and that if they offer'd to commit any Di&s;order, &s;o as to &s;poil, burn, kill, or de&s;troy any of the Corn, Plantings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle belonging to the Society, they &s;hould dye without Mercy, and they would &s;hoot them where-ever they could find them.</P>
<P>The Governor, a Man of great Humanity, mu&s;ing upon the Sentence, con&s;ider'd a little up|on
<PB N="77" REF="86">
it, and turning to the two hone&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> &s;aid, Hold, you mu&s;t reflect, that it will be long e'er they can rai&s;e Corn and Cattle of their own, and they mu&s;t not &s;tarve: We mu&s;t therefore al|low them Provi&s;ions, &s;o he caus'd to be added, That they &s;hould have a Proportion of Corn gi|ven them to la&s;t them eight Months, and for Seed to &s;ow, by which Time they might be &s;uppos'd to rai&s;e &s;ome of their own; that they &s;hould have &s;ix Milch-Goats, four He-Goats, and &s;ix Kids given them, as well for pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tence, as for a Store; and that they &s;hould have Tools given them for their Work in the Fields; &s;uch as, &s;ix Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and the like: But they &s;hould have none of the&s;e Tools, or Provi&s;i|ons, unle&s;s they would &s;wear &s;olemnly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with them, or of their Fellow <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they di&s;mi&s;s'd them the Society, and turn'd them out to &s;hift for them&s;elves. They went away &s;ullen and refractory, as neither con|tented to go away, or to &s;tay; but, as there was no Remedy, they went, pretending, to go and choo&s;e a Place where they would &s;ettle them&s;elves to plant and live by them&s;elves, and &s;ome Provi|&s;ion were given them, but no Weapons.</P>
<P>About four or five Days after, they came a|gain for &s;ome Victuals, and gave the Governour an Account where they had pitch'd their Tents, and mark'd them&s;elves out an Habitation and Plantation; and it was a very convenient Place indeed, on the remote&s;t Part of the I&s;land, N.E. much about the Place where I landed in my fir&s;t Voyage, when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord knows whether, in my Attempt to &s;urround the I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="87">
Here they built them&s;elves two hand&s;ome Huts, and contriv'd them, in a Manner, like my fir&s;t Habitation, being clo&s;e under the Side of a Hill, having &s;ome Trees growing already on three Sides of it, &s;o that by planting others it would be very ea&s;ily cover'd from the Sight, un|le&s;s narrowly &s;earch'd for; they de&s;ir'd &s;ome dry'd Goats-&s;kins for Beds and Covering, which were given them; and upon giving their Words, that they would not di&s;turb the re&s;t, or injure any of their Plantations, they gave them Hatch|ets and what other Tools they could &s;pare, &s;ome Peas, Barley, and Rice, for &s;owing, and, in a Word, any thing they wanted, but Arms and Ammunition.</P>
<P>They liv'd in this &s;eparate Condition about &s;ix Months, and had gotten in their fir&s;t Harve&s;t, tho' the Quantity was but &s;mall, the Parcel of Land they had planted being but little; for indeed, ha|ving all their Plantation to form, they had a great deal of Work upon their Hands; and when they came to make Boards, and Pots, and &s;uch Things, they were quite out of their Element, and could make nothing of it; and when the rainy Sea&s;on came on, for want of a Cave in the Earth, they could not keep their Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of &s;poiling: And this humbled them much; &s;o they came and begg'd the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> to help them, which they very readily did, and in four Days work'd a great Hole in the Side of the Hill for them, big enough to &s;ecure their Corn, and other Things from the Rain; but it was but a poor Place, at be&s;t, compar'd to mine; and e&s;pecially as mine was then, for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had greatly enlarg'd it, and made &s;everal new Apartments in it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="88">
About three Quarters of a Year after this Sepa|ration, a new Frolick took the&s;e Rogues, which, together with the former Villany they had com|mitted, brought Mi&s;chief enough upon them, and had very near been the Ruin of the whole Colo|ny: The three new Sociates began, it &s;eems, to be weary of the laborious Life they led, and that without Hope of bettering their Circum&s;tances; and a Whim took them, that they would make a Voyage to the Continent from whence the Sa|vages came, and would try if they could not &s;eize upon &s;ome Pri&s;oners among the Natives there, and bring them Home, &s;o to make them do the laborious Part of their Work for them.</P>
<P>The Project was not &s;o prepo&s;terous, if they had gone no farther; but they did nothing, and pro|pos'd nothing, but had either Mi&s;chief in the De|&s;ign, or Mi&s;chief in the Event: And if I may give my Opinion, they &s;eem'd to be under a Bla&s;t from Heaven; for if we will not allow a vi&s;ible Cur&s;e to pur&s;ue vi&s;ible Crimes, how &s;hall we reconcile the Events of Things with the Divine Ju&s;tice? It was certainly an apparent Vengeance on their Crime of Mutiny and Piracy, that brought them to the State they were in; and as they &s;hew'd not the lea&s;t Remor&s;e for the Crime, but added new Vil|lanies to it, &s;uch as, particularly, the Piece of mon&s;trous Cruelty of wounding a poor Slave, be|cau&s;e he did not, or perhaps could not, under|&s;tand to do what he was directed; and to wound him in &s;uch a Manner, as, no Que&s;tion, made him a Cripple all his Life; and in a Place where no Surgeon or Medicine could be had for his Cure; and what was &s;till wor&s;e, the murderous Intent, or, to do Ju&s;tice to the Crime, the intentional
<PB N="80" REF="89">
Murder, for &s;uch, to be &s;ure it was, as was af|terwards the form'd De&s;ign they all laid, to mur|der the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in cold Blood, and in their Sleep.</P>
<P>But I leave ob&s;erving, and return to the Story; The three Fellows comes down to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> one Morning, and in very humble Terms de&s;ir'd to be admitted to &s;peak with them: The <HI>Spani|ards</HI> very readily heard what they had to &s;ay, which was this, That they were tir'd of living in the Manner they did; that they were not handy enough to make the Nece&s;&s;aries they wanted; and that having no Help, they found they &s;hould be &s;tarv'd: But if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would give them Leave to take one of the Canoes which they came over in, and give them Arms and Ammunition, proportion'd for their Defence, they would go over to the Main, and &s;eek their Fortune, and &s;o deliver them from the Trouble of &s;upplying them with any other Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were glad enough to be rid of them, but yet very hone&s;tly repre&s;ented to them the certain De&s;truction they were running into; told them they had &s;uffer'd &s;uch Hard&s;hips up|on that very Spot, that they could, without any Spirit of Prophe&s;y, tell them, that they would be &s;tarv'd, or be murder'd, and bad them con&s;i|der of it.</P>
<P>The Men reply'd audaciou&s;ly, they &s;hould be &s;tarv'd if they &s;tay'd here, for they could not work, and would not work; and they could but be &s;tarv'd Abroad, and if they were mur|der'd, there was an End of them, they had no Wives or Children to cry after them; and
<PB N="81" REF="90">
in &s;hort, in&s;i&s;ted importunately upon their De|mand, declaring, that they would go, whether they would give them any Arms or no.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> told them, with great Kindne&s;s, that if they were re&s;olv'd to go, they &s;hould not go like naked Men, and be in no Conditi|on to defend them&s;elves; and that tho' they could ill &s;pare their Fire-Arms, having not enough for them&s;elves, yet they would let them have two Mu&s;kets, a Pi&s;tol, and a Cutla&s;h, and each Man a Hatchet, which they thought was &s;ufficient for them.</P>
<P>In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having baked them Bread enough to &s;erve them a Month, and given them as much Goats-Fle&s;h as they could eat while it was &s;weet, and a great Ba&s;ket full of dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of fre&s;h Water, and a young Kid alive to kill, they boldly &s;et out in a Canoe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was at lea&s;t 40 Miles broad.</P>
<P>The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well carry'd fifteen or twenty Men; and, therefore, was rather too big for them to manage: But as they had a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with them, they did well enough: They had made a Ma&s;t of a long Pole, and a Sail of four large Goat-Skins dry'd, which they had &s;ow'd or lac'd together; and away they went mer|rily enough; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd after them, <HI>Bon Veyajo;</HI> and no Man ever thought of &s;eeing them any more,</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> would often &s;ay to one another, and the two hone&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men who remain'd behind,
<PB N="82" REF="91">
how quietly and comfortably they liv'd now tho&s;e three turbulent Fellows were gone; as for their ever coming again, that was the remote&s;t Thing from their Thoughts that could be imagin'd; when behold, after two and twenty Days Ab&s;ence, one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men being abroad upon his Planting-Work, &s;ees three &s;trange Men coming to|wards him at a Di&s;tance, with Guns upon their Shoulders.</P>
<P>Away runs the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, as if he was be|witch'd, comes frighted and amaz'd to the Go|vernour <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and tells him they were all un|done, for there were Strangers landed upon the I|&s;land, he could not tell who: The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> pau|&s;ing a while, &s;ays to him, How do you mean, you cannot tell who? They are the Savages to be &s;ure, No, no, &s;ays the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, they are Men in Cloaths with Arms: Nay, then, &s;ays the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> Why are you concern'd? If they are not Savages they mu&s;t be Friends, for there is no Chri&s;tian Na|tion upon Earth but will do us Good rather than Harm.</P>
<P>While they were debating thus, comes the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and &s;tanding without the Wood, which was new planted, hallo'd to them; they pre&s;ently knew their Voices, and &s;o all the Wonder of that kind ceas'd. But now the Ad|miration was turn'd upon another Que&s;tion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> what could be the Matter, and what made them come back again?</P>
<P>It was not long before they brought the Men in, and enquiring where they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them a full Ac|count of their Voyage in a few Words, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That
<PB N="83" REF="92">
they reach'd the Land in two Days, or &s;omething le&s;s, but finding the People alarm'd at their com|ing, and preparing with Bows and Arrows to fight them, they dur&s;t not go on Shore, but &s;ail'd on to the Northward &s;ix or &s;even Hours, till they came to a great Opening, by which they perceiv'd, that the Land they &s;aw from our I&s;land was not the Main, but an I&s;land; that entring that Opening of the Sea, they &s;aw another I&s;land on the Right-Hand North, and &s;everal more We&s;t; and being re&s;olv'd to land &s;omewhere, they put over to one of the I&s;lands which lay We&s;t, and went boldly on Shore; that they found the People very cour|teous and friendly to them, and that they gave them &s;everal Roots and &s;ome dry'd Fi&s;h, and ap|pear'd very &s;ociable; and the Women, as well as the Men, were very forward to &s;upply them with any thing they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a great Way upon their Heads.</P>
<P>They continu'd here four Days, and enquir'd, as well as they could of them by Signs, what Na|tions were this Way and that Way; and were told of &s;everal fierce and terrible People that liv'd al|mo&s;t every Way, who, as they made Signs to them, u&s;ed to eat Men. But as for them&s;elves, they &s;aid, that they never eat Men or Women, except only &s;uch as they took in the Wars, and then they own'd that they made a great Fea&s;t, and eat their Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men enquir'd when they had a Fea&s;t of that Kind, and they told him about two Moons ago, pointing to the Moon, and then to two Fin|gers; and that their great King had two hundred Pri&s;oners now, which he had taken in his War; and they were feeling them to make them fat for
<PB N="84" REF="93">
the next Fea&s;t. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men &s;eem'd mighty di&s;irous to &s;ee tho&s;e Pri&s;oners, but the other mi|&s;taking them, thought they were de&s;irous to have &s;ome of them to carry away for their own eating. So they beckon'd to them, pointing to the &s;etting of the Sun, and then to the ri&s;ing, which was to &s;ignify, that the next Morning at Sun-ri&s;ing they would bring &s;ome for them; and accordingly the next Morning they brought down five Women and eleven Men, and gave them to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, to carry with them on their Voyage, ju&s;t as we would bring &s;o many Cows and Oxen down to a Sea-Port Town, to victual a Ship.</P>
<P>As bruti&s;h and barbarous as the&s;e Fellows were at Home, their Stomachs turn'd at this Sight, and they did not know what to do; to refu&s;e the Pri|&s;oners, would have been the highe&s;t Affront to the &s;avage Gentry that offer'd them; and what to do with them they knew not; however, upon &s;ome Debates, they re&s;olv'd to accept of them, and in Re|turn they gave the Savages that brought them one of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and &s;ix or &s;even of their Bullets, which, tho' they did not under&s;tand, they &s;eem'd extremely pleas'd with: And then tying the poor Creatures Hands behind them, they (the People) dragg'd the poor Pri&s;o|ners into the Boat for our Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men were oblig'd to come away as &s;oon as they had them, or el&s;e they that gave them this noble Pre&s;ent would certainly have expected that they &s;hould have gone to work with them, have kill'd two or three of them the next Morning, and perhaps have invited the Donors to Dinner.</P>
<P>But having taken their Leave with all the Re|&s;pects
<PB N="85" REF="94">
and Thanks that could well pa&s;s between People, where on either Side they under&s;tood not one Word they could &s;ay, they put off with their Boat, and came back towards the fir&s;t I&s;land, where, when they arriv'd, they &s;et eight of their Pri&s;o|ners at Liberty, there being too many of them for their Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have &s;ome Communication with their Pri&s;oners, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to make them under&s;tand any Thing; nothing they could &s;ay to them, or give them, or do for them, but was look'd upon as going a|bout to murder them. They fir&s;t of all unbound them, but the poor Creatures &s;kream'd at that, e&s;|pecially the Women, as if they had ju&s;t felt the Knife at their Throats; for they immediately concluded they were unbound on purpo&s;e to be kill'd.</P>
<P>If they gave them any Thing to eat, it was the &s;ame Thing; then they concluded it was for fear they &s;hould &s;ink in Fle&s;h, and &s;o not be fat enough to kill. If they look'd at one of them more parti|cularly, the Party pre&s;ently concluded, it was to &s;ee whether he or &s;he was fatte&s;t and fitte&s;t to kill. Nay, after they had brought them quite over, and began to u&s;e them kindly, and treat them well, &s;till they expected every Day to make a Din|ner or a Supper for their new Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>When the three Wanderers had given this un|accountable Hi&s;tory, or Journal of their Voyage, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> a&s;k'd them, Where their new Family was? and being told that they had brought them on Shore, and put them into one of their Huts, and were come up to beg &s;ome Victuals for them; they (the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) and the other two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="95">
Men, that is to &s;ay, the whole Colony, re&s;olv'd to go all down to the Place and &s;ee them, and did &s;o, and <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father with them.</P>
<P>When they came into the Hut, <HI>there they &s;ate</HI> all bound; for when they had brought them on Shore, they bound their Hands that they might not take the Boat and make their E&s;cape. There, I &s;ay, they &s;ate, all of them &s;tark naked: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There were three Men, lu&s;ty comely Fellows, well &s;hap'd, &s;trait and fair Limbs, about thirty to thir|ty five Years of Age; and five Women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two more not above four or five and twenty, and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden about &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen: The Women were well favour'd agreeable Per&s;ons both in Shape and Features, only tawny, and two of them, had they been perfect White, would have pa&s;s'd for very hand&s;ome Women even in <HI>London</HI> it&s;elf, having plea&s;ant agreeable Counte|nances and of a very mode&s;t Behaviour, e&s;pecially when they came afterwards to be cloath'd, and dre&s;s'd, as they call'd it, tho' the Dre&s;s was very indifferent it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd; of which hereafter.</P>
<P>The Sight, you may be &s;ure, was &s;omething uncouth to our <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were (to give them a ju&s;t Character) Men of the be&s;t Behaviour, of the mo&s;t calm, &s;edate Tempers, and perfect Good-humour that ever I met with, and in particular, of the mo&s;t Mode&s;ty, as will pre&s;ently appear: I &s;ay, the Sight was very uncouth, to &s;ee two na|ked Men and five naked Women, all together bound, and in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances that Human Nature could be &s;uppos'd to be, <HI>viz.</HI> to be expecting every Moment to be dragg'd out,
<PB N="87" REF="96">
and have their Brains knock'd out, and then to be eaten up like a Calf that is kill'd for a Dainty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing they did, was to cau&s;e the old <HI>Indian, Friday</HI>'s Father, to go in and &s;ee fir&s;t if he knew any of them, and then if he under&s;tood any of their Speech: As &s;oon as the old Man came in, he look'd &s;eriou&s;ly at them, but knew none of them; neither could any of them under&s;tand a Word he &s;aid, or a Sign he could make, except one of the Women.</P>
<P>However, this was enough to an&s;wer the End, which was to &s;atisfy them, that the Men into who&s;e Hands they were fallen, were Chri&s;tians; that they abhorr'd eating of Men or Women, and that they might be &s;ure they would not be kill'd: As &s;oon as they were a&s;&s;ur'd of this, they di&s;co|ver'd &s;uch a Joy, and by &s;uch aukward, and &s;eve|ral Ways, as is hard to de&s;cribe; for it &s;eems they were of &s;everal Nations.</P>
<P>The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid in the next Place to a&s;k them, if they were willing to be Servants, and to work for the Men who had brought them away, to &s;ave their Lives; at which they all fell a Dancing; and pre&s;ently one fell to taking up this, and another that, any Thing that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to work.</P>
<P>The Governor, who found, that the having Women among them would pre&s;ently be attended with &s;ome Inconvenience, and might occa&s;ion &s;ome Strife, and perhaps Blood; a&s;k'd the three Men, what they intended to do with the&s;e Wo|men, and how they intended to u&s;e them; whe|ther
<PB N="88" REF="97">
as Servants, or as Women? One of the <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen</HI> an&s;wer'd very boldly and readily, That they would u&s;e them as both. To which the Go|vernor &s;aid, <HI>I</HI> am not going to re&s;train you from it, you are your own Ma&s;ters as to that: But this I think is but ju&s;t, for avoiding Di&s;orders and Quarrels among you; and I de&s;ire it of you, for that Rea&s;on only, <HI>viz.</HI> That you will all engage, that if any of you take any of the&s;e Women, as a Woman or Wife, that he &s;hall take but one; and that having taken one, none el&s;e &s;hould touch her; for tho' we cannot marry any of you, yet 'tis but rea&s;onable, that while you &s;tay here, the Woman any of you takes, &s;hould be maintain'd by the Man that takes her, and &s;hould be his Wife; I mean, &s;ays he, while he continues here, and that none el&s;e &s;hall have any Thing to do with her: All this appear'd &s;o ju&s;t, that every one a|greed to it without any Difficulty.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> a&s;k'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if they de&s;ign'd to take any of them? But every one of them an&s;wer'd, NO: Some of them &s;aid, they had Wives in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the others did not like Women that were not Chri&s;tians; and all toge|ther declar'd, that they would not touch one of them; which was an In&s;tance of &s;uch Virtue, as I have not met with in all my Travels. On the other Hand, to be &s;hort, the five <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> took them every one a Wife, that is to &s;ay, a tem|porary Wife; and &s;o they &s;et up a new Form of Living; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father liv'd in my old Habitation, which they had enlarg'd exceedingly within. The three Servants which were taken in the late Battle of the Savages, liv'd with them; and the&s;e carry'd on the main Part of the Colony, &s;upply|ing
<PB N="89" REF="98">
all the re&s;t with Food, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in any Thing as they could, or as they found Nece&s;&s;i|ty requir'd.</P>
<P>But the Wonder of this Story was, how five &s;uch refractory ill match'd Fellows &s;hould agree about the&s;e Women, and that two of them &s;hould not pitch upon the &s;ame Woman, e&s;pecially &s;ee|ing two or three of them were, without Compari|&s;on, more agreeable than the other: But they took a good Way enough to prevent quarrelling among them&s;elves; for they &s;et the five Women by them&s;elves in one of their Huts, and they went all into the other Hut, and drew Lots among them, who &s;hould chu&s;e fir&s;t.</P>
<P>He that drew to chu&s;e fir&s;t, went away by him|&s;elf to the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were, and fetch'd out her he cho&s;e; and it was worth ob&s;erving, that he that cho&s;e fir&s;t took her that was reckon'd the homelie&s;t, and the olde&s;t of the five, which made Mirth enough among the re&s;t; and even the <HI>Spaniards</HI> laugh'd at it: But the Fel|low con&s;ider'd better than any of them, that it was Application and Bu&s;ine&s;s that they were to ex|pect A&s;&s;i&s;tance in, as much as any Thing el&s;e; and &s;he prov'd the be&s;t Wife of all the Parcel.</P>
<P>When the poor Women &s;aw them&s;elves &s;et in a Row thus, and fetch'd out one by one, the Ter|rors of their Condition return'd upon them again, and they firmly believ'd that they were now a going to be devour'd; accordingly, when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailor came in and fetch'd out one of them; the re&s;t &s;et up a mo&s;t lamentable Cry, and hung a|bout her, and took their Leave of her with &s;uch Agonies and &s;uch Affection, as would have
<PB N="90" REF="99">
griev'd the harde&s;t Heart in the World; nor was it po&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> to &s;atisfy them, that were not to be immediately murder'd, 'till they fetch'd the old Man, <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father, who im|mediately let them know that the five Men, who had fetch'd them out one by one, had cho&s;en them for their Wives.</P>
<P>When they had done, and the Fright the Women were in was a little over, the Men went to Work, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came and help'd them; and in a few Hours they had built them every one a new Hut or Tent for their Lodging apart; for tho&s;e they had already, were crowded with their Tools, Hou&s;hold-Stuff, and Provi&s;ion. The three wicked Ones had pitch'd farthe&s;t off, and the two hone&s;t Ones nearer, but both on the North Shore of the I&s;land, &s;o that they continu'd &s;eparate as before: And thus my I&s;land was peopled in three Places; and, as I might &s;ay, three Towns were begun to be planted.</P>
<P>And here 'tis very well worth ob&s;erving, That as it often happens in the World (what the wi&s;e Ends of God's Providence are in &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition of Things, I cannot &s;ay) the two hone&s;t Fellows had the two wor&s;t Wives, and the three Reprobates, that were &s;carce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither &s;eem'd born to do them&s;elves Good, or any one el&s;e, had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious Wives; not that the two fir&s;t were ill Wives, as to their Temper or Humour; for all the five were mo&s;t willing, quiet, pa&s;&s;ive, and &s;ubjected Creatures, rather like Slaves than Wives; but my Meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or indu&s;trious, or alike clean|ly and neat.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="100">
Another Ob&s;ervation I mu&s;t make, to the Ho|nour of a diligent Application on one Hand, and to the Di&s;grace of a &s;lothful, negligent, idle Tem|per, on the other, that when I came to the Place, and view'd the &s;everal Improvements, Plantings, and Management of the &s;everal little Colonies, the two Men had &s;o far out-gone the three, that there was no Compari&s;on. They had indeed both of them as much Ground laid out for Corn as they wanted; and the Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e, according to my Rule, Nature dictated, that it was to no Purpo&s;e to &s;ow more Corn than they wanted, but the Difference of the Cultivation, of the Planting, of the Fences, and indeed of every Thing el&s;e was ea&s;y to be &s;een at fir&s;t View.</P>
<P>The two Men had innumerable young Trees planted about their Huts, that when you came to the Place, nothing was to be &s;een but a Wood, and tho' they had twice had their Plantation de|moli&s;h'd, once by their own Countrymen, and once by the Enemy, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in its Place; yet they had re&s;tor'd all again, and every Thing was thriving and flouri&s;hing about them; they had Grapes planted in Order, and manag'd like a Vineyard, tho' they had them&s;elves never &s;een any Thing of that Kind; and by their good order|ing their Vines, their Grapes were as good again as any of the others. They had al&s;o found them|&s;elves out a Retreat in the thicke&s;t Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a natural Cave, as I had found, yet they made one with ince&s;&s;ant Labour of their Hands, and where when the Mi&s;chief which follow'd happen'd, they &s;e|cur'd their Wives and Children, &s;o as they could never be found; they having by &s;ticking innu|merable
<PB N="92" REF="101">
Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which, as I &s;aid, grew &s;o ea&s;ily, made the Wood unpa&s;&s;able, except in &s;ome Places, where they climb'd up to get over the out-&s;ide Part, and then went on by Ways of their own leaving.</P>
<P>As to the three Reprobates, as I ju&s;tly call them, tho' they were much civiliz'd by their new Settlement, compar'd to what they were before, and were not &s;o quarrel&s;om, having not the &s;ame Opportunity; yet one of the certain Companions of a profligate Mind never left them, and that was their Idlene&s;s. It is true, they planted Corn, and made Fences; but <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Words were never better verify'd than in them: <HI>I went by the Vine|yard of the Slothful, and it was all over-grown with Thorns;</HI> for when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came to view their Crop, they could not &s;ee it in &s;ome Places for Weeds; the Hedge had &s;everal Gaps in it, where the wild Goats had gotten in, and eaten up the Corn; perhaps, here and there, a dead Bu&s;h was cramm'd in, to &s;top them out for the Pre&s;ent, but it was only &s;hutting the Stable-door after the Steed was &s;toln. Whereas, when they look'd on the Colony of the other two, there was the very Face of Indu&s;try and Succe&s;s upon all they did; there was not a Weed to be &s;een in all their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges: And they on the other Hand verify'd <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Words in ano|ther Place, <HI>That the diligent Hand makes rich;</HI> for every Thing grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty within and without; they had more tame Cattle than the other, more Uten&s;ils and Nece&s;&s;aries with|in Doors, and yet more Plea&s;ure and Diver&s;ion too.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="102">
It is true, the Wives of the three were very handy and cleanly within Doors, and having learn'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ways of Dre&s;&s;ing and Cooking from one of the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who, as I &s;aid, was Cook's-mate on board the Ship, they dre&s;s'd their Hu&s;bands Victuals very nicely and well; whereas the other could not be brought to under&s;tand it; but then the Hu&s;band, who, as I &s;ay, had been Cook's-mate, did it him&s;elf; but as for the Hu&s;bands of the three Wives, they loyter'd about, fetch'd Turtles Eggs, and caught Fi&s;h, and Birds; in a Word, any Thing but La|bour, and they far'd accordingly. The Diligent liv'd well and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and beggarly; and &s;o I believe, generally &s;peaking, it is all over the World.</P>
<P>But now I come to a Scene, different from all that had happen'd before, either to them, or to me; and the Original of the Story was this:</P>
<P>Early one Morning there came on Shore five or &s;ix Canoes of <HI>Indians,</HI> or <HI>Savages,</HI> call them which you plea&s;e; and there is no room to doubt that they came upon the old Errand of feeding upon their Slaves: But that Part was now &s;o familiar to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to our Men too, that they did not concern them&s;elves about it, as I did; but having been made &s;en&s;i|ble by their Experience, that their only Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to lie conceal'd, and that if they were not &s;een by any of the Savages, they would go off again quietly when their Bu&s;ine&s;s was done, having as yet not the lea&s;t Notion of there being any Inhabitants in the I&s;land; I &s;ay, ha|ving been made &s;en&s;ible of this, they had no|thing
<PB N="94" REF="103">
to do but to give Notice to all the three Plantations, to keep within Doors, and not &s;hew them&s;elves, only placing a Scout in a pro|per Place, to give Notice when the Boats went to Sea again.</P>
<P>This was without doubt very right; but a Di&s;a&s;ter &s;poil'd all the&s;e Mea&s;ures, and made it known among the Savages, that there were Inhabitants there, which was in the End the De|&s;olation of almo&s;t the whole Colony; after the Canoes with the Savages were gone off, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> peep'd abroad again, and &s;ome of them had the Curio&s;ity to go to the Place where they had been, to &s;ee what they had been do|ing: Here, to their great Surprize, they found three Savages left behind, and lying fa&s;t a&s;leep upon the Ground; it was &s;uppos'd, they had ei|ther been &s;o gorg'd with their inhuman Fea&s;t, that, like Bea&s;ts, they were a&s;leep, and would not &s;tir when the others went, or they were wan|der'd into the Woods, and did not come back in time to be taken in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were greatly &s;urpriz'd at this Sight, and perfectly at a Lo&s;s what to do; the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governour, as it happen'd, was with them, and his Advice was ask'd, but he profe&s;s'd he knew not what to do; as for Slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing them, they were none of them inclin'd to that; the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governour told me, they could not think of &s;hed|ding innocent Blood, for as to them, the poor Creatures had done them no Wrong, invaded none of their Property, and they thought they had no ju&s;t Quarrel again&s;t them, to take away their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="104">
And here I mu&s;t, in Ju&s;tice to the&s;e <HI>Spaniards,</HI> ob&s;erve, that let the Accounts of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cruelty in <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> be what they will, I never met with &s;eventeen Men of any Nation what&s;oe|ver, in any foreign Country, who were &s;o uni|ver&s;ally Mode&s;t, Temperate, Virtuous, &s;o very Good-humour'd, and &s;o Courteous as the&s;e <HI>Spa|niards;</HI> and as to Cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very Nature, no Inhumanity, no Barba|rity, no outragious Pa&s;&s;ions, and yet all of them Men of great Courage and Spirit.</P>
<P>Their Temper and Calmne&s;s had appear'd in their bearing the un&s;ufferable U&s;age of the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men; and their Ju&s;tice and Huma|nity appear'd now in the Ca&s;e of the Savages, as above. After &s;ome Con&s;ultation, they re|&s;olv'd upon this, that they would lie &s;till a while longer, 'till, if po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e three Men might be gone; but then the Governour <HI>Spani|ard</HI> recollected, that the three Savages had no Boat, and that if they were left to rove about the I&s;land, they would certainly di&s;cover that there were Inhabitants in it, and &s;o they &s;hould be undone that Way.</P>
<P>Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the Fellows fa&s;t a&s;leep &s;till, &s;o they re&s;olv'd to waken them, and take them Pri&s;oners, and they did &s;o; the poor Fellows were &s;trangely frighted when they were &s;eiz'd upon and bound, and afraid, like the Women, that they &s;hould be murder'd and eaten; for it &s;eems tho&s;e People think all the World does as they do, eating Mens Fle&s;h; but they were &s;oon made ea&s;y as to that, and away they carry'd them.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="105">
It was very happy to them that they did not carry them Home to their Ca&s;tle, I mean to my Palace under the Hill; but they carry'd them fir&s;t to the Bower, where was the chief of their Country-work, &s;uch as the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and afterwards, they carry'd them to the Habitation of the two <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Men.</P>
<P>Here they were &s;et to work, tho' it was not much they had for them to do; and whether it was by Negligence in guarding them, or that they thought the Fellows could not mend them&s;elves, I know not, but one of them run away, and taking into the Woods, they could never hear of him more.</P>
<P>They had good Rea&s;on to believe he got Home again &s;oon after, in &s;ome other Boats or Canoes of Savages, who came on Shore three or four Weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their Re|vels as u&s;ual, went off again in two Days time: This Thought terrify'd them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without good Cau&s;e indeed, that if this Fellow came &s;afe Home among his Comrades, he would certainly give them an Account, that there were People in the I&s;land, as al&s;o how few and weak they were; for this Savage, as I ob&s;erv'd before, had never been told, and it was very happy he had not, how many they were, or where they liv'd; nor had he ever &s;een or heard the Fire of any of their Guns, much le&s;s had they &s;hewn him any of their other retir'd Places; &s;uch as the Cave in the Valley, or the new Retreat which the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men had made, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="106">
The fir&s;t Te&s;timony they had that this Fel|low had given Intelligence of them, was that about two Months after this, &s;ix Canoes of Sa|vages, with about &s;even, or e ght, or ten Men in a Canoe, came rowing along the North Side of the I&s;land, where they never u&s;ed to come before, and landed about an Hour after Sun|ri&s;e, at a convenient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation of the two <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> where this e&s;cap'd Man had been kept: As the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governor &s;aid, had they been all there, the Damage would not have been &s;o much, for not a Man of them would have e&s;cap d; but the Ca&s;e differ'd now very much, for two Men to fifty was too much odds: The two Men had the Hap|pine&s;s to di&s;cover them about a League off, &s;o that it was above an Hour before they landed, and as they landed a Mile from their Huts, it was &s;ome time before they could come at them: Now having great Rea&s;on to believe that they were betray'd, the fir&s;t Thing they did, was to bind the two Slaves which were left, and cau&s;e two of the three Men, who they brought with the Women, who it &s;eems prov'd very faithful to them, to lead them with their two Wives, and what ever they could carry away with them, to their retir'd Place in the Woods, which I have &s;poken of above, and there to bind the two Fel|lows Hand and Foot 'till they heard farther.</P>
<P>In the next Place, &s;eeing the Savages were all come on Shore, and that they bent their Cour&s;e directly that Way, they open'd the Fences where their Milch-Goats were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their Goats to &s;traggle into the Wood, whither they pleas'd, that the Savages
<PB N="98" REF="107">
might think they were all bred wild; but the Rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave them an Account of it all; for they went directly to the Place.</P>
<P>When the two poor frighted Men had &s;ecur'd their Wives and Goods, they &s;ent the other Slave they had of the three, who came with the Wo|men, and who was at their Place by Accident, away to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and de&s;ire &s;peedy Help; and in the mean Time they took their Arms, and what Ammunition they had, and retreated to|wards the Place in the Wood, where their Wives were &s;ent, keeping at a Di&s;tance, yet &s;o that they might &s;ee, if po&s;&s;ible, which Way the Sa|vages took.</P>
<P>They had not gone far, but that, from a ri|&s;ing Ground, they could &s;ee the little Army of their Enemies come on directly to their Habita|tion, and in a Moment more, could &s;ee all their Huts and Hou&s;hold-Stuff flaming up together, to their great Grief and Mortification; for they had a very great Lo&s;s, to them irretrievable, at lea&s;t for &s;ome Time. They kept their Station for a while, 'till they found the Savages, like wild Bea&s;ts, &s;pread them&s;elves all over the Place, rumaging every Way, and every Place they could think of, in Search for Prey, and in par|ticular for the People, of whom it now plainly appear'd they had Intelligence.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> &s;eeing this, thinking them|&s;elves not &s;ecure where they &s;tood, becau&s;e as it was likely &s;ome of the wild People might come that Way, &s;o they might come too many
<PB N="99" REF="108">
together, thought it proper to make another Re|treat about half a Mile farther, believing, as it afterwards happen'd, that the farther they &s;troll'd, the fewer would be together.</P>
<P>The next Halt was at the Entrance into a ve|ry thick grown Part of the Woods, and where an old Trunk of a Tree &s;tood, which was hollow and va&s;tly large; and in this Tree they both took their Standing, re&s;olving to &s;ee there what might offer.</P>
<P>They had not &s;tood there long, but two of the Savages appear'd running directly that Way, as if they had already had Notice where they &s;tood, and were coming up to attack them; and a little Way farther, they &s;py'd three more coming after them, and five more beyond them, all coming the &s;ame Way; be&s;ides which, they &s;aw &s;even or eight more at a Di&s;tance, running another Way; for in a Word, they ran every Way like Sport&s;men beating for their Game.</P>
<P>The poor Men were now in great Perplexity' whether they &s;hould &s;tand and keep their Po&s;ture, or fly: But after a very &s;hort Debate with them|&s;elves, they con&s;ider'd, that if the Savages rang'd the Country thus before Help came, they might perhaps find out their Retreat in the Woods, then all would be lo&s;t; &s;o they re&s;olv'd to &s;tand them there; and if they were too many to deal with, then they would get up to the Top of the Tree, from whence they doubted not to defend them&s;elves. <HI>Fire excepted,</HI> as long as their Am|munition la&s;ted, tho' all the Savages that were landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="109">
Having re&s;olv'd upon this, they next con&s;ider'd whether they &s;hould fire at the fir&s;t two, or wait for the three, and &s;o take the middle Par|ty, by which the two and the five that follow'd would be &s;eparated; and they re&s;olv'd to let the two fir&s;t pa&s;s by, unle&s;s they &s;hould &s;py them in the Tree, and come to attack them. The two fir&s;t Savages al&s;o confirm'd them in this Regulation, by turning a little from them to|wards another Part of the Wood; but the three, and the five after them, came forwards directly to the Tree, as if they had known the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> were there.</P>
<P>Seeing them come &s;o &s;trait towards them, they re&s;olv'd to take them in a Line, as they came; and as they re&s;olv d to fire but one at a Time, perhaps the fir&s;t Shot might hit them all three, to which Purpo&s;e, the Man who was to fire, put three or four Bullets into his Piece, and having a fair Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken Hole in the Tree, he took a &s;ure Aim, without being &s;een, waiting till they were within about thirty Yards of the Tree, &s;o that he could not mi&s;s.</P>
<P>While they were thus waiting, and the Sava|ges came on, they plainly &s;aw, that one of the three was the Run away Savage that had e&s;cap'd from them, and they both knew him di&s;tinctly, and re&s;olv'd that, if po&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould not e&s;cape, tho' they &s;hould both fire; &s;o the other &s;tood rea|dy with his Peice, that if he did not drop at the fir&s;t Shot, he &s;hould be &s;ure to have a &s;econd.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="110">
But the fir&s;t was too good a Mark&s;man to mi&s;s his Aim; for as the Savages kept near one another, a little behind in a Line, in a Word, he fir'd, and hit two of them directly: The foremo&s;t was kill'd outright, being &s;hot in the Head: The &s;econd, which was the run-away <HI>Indian,</HI> was &s;hot thro' the Body, and fell, but was not quite dead: And the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder, perhaps by the &s;ame Ball that went thro' the Body of the &s;econd, and being dreadfully frighted, tho' not much hurt, &s;ate down upon the Ground, &s;kreaming and yelling in a hideous manner.</P>
<P>The five that were behind, more frighted with the Noi&s;e than &s;en&s;ible of the Danger, &s;tood &s;till at fir&s;t; for the Woods made the Sound a thou&s;and Times bigger than it really was; the Echo's rattling from one Side to another, and the Fowls ri&s;ing from all Parts, &s;kreaming, and making, every Sort, a &s;everal Kind of Noi&s;e, according to their Kind, ju&s;t as it was when I fir'd the fir&s;t Gun that perhaps was ever &s;hot off in that Place &s;ince it was an I&s;land.</P>
<P>However, all being &s;ilent again, and they not knowing what the Matter was, came on uncon|cern'd, 'till they came to the Place where their Companions lay in a Condition mi&s;erable enough: And here the poor ignorant Creatures, not &s;en&s;ible that they were within Reach of the &s;ame Mi&s;chief, &s;tood all of a Huddle over the wounded Man, talk|ing, and, as may be &s;uppos'd, enquiring of him, how he came to be hurt; and who, 'tis very rational to believe, told them, that a Fla&s;h of Fire fir&s;t, and immediately after that, Thunder from their Gods, had kill'd tho&s;e two, and wounded him: This, I &s;ay,
<PB N="102" REF="111">
is rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as they &s;aw on Man near them, &s;o they had never heard a Gun in all their Lives, or &s;o much as heard of a Gun; neither knew they any Thing of killing or wounding, at a Di&s;tance, with Fire and Bullets; if they had, one might rea&s;onably be|lieve, they would not have &s;tood &s;o unconcern'd, in viewing the Fate of their Fellows, without &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion of their own.</P>
<P>Our two Men, tho' as they confe&s;s'd to me, it griev'd them to be oblig'd to kill &s;o many poor Creatures, who, at the &s;ame Time, had no Notion of their Danger; yet having them all thus in their Power, and the fir&s;t having loaded his Piece again; re&s;olv'd to let fly both together among them; and &s;ingling out, by Agreement, which to aim at, they &s;hot together, and kill'd or very much wounded four of them; the fifth, frighted even to Death, tho' not hurt, fell with the re&s;t; &s;o that our Men &s;eeing them all fall together, thought they had kill'd them all.</P>
<P>The Belief that the Savages were all kill'd, made our two Men come boldly out from the Tree be|fore they had charg'd their Guns again, which was a wrong Step; and they were under &s;ome Surprize when they came to the Place, and found no le&s;s than four of the Men alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: This o|blig'd them to fall upon them with the Stocks of their Mu&s;kets; and fir&s;t they made &s;ure of the run away Savage, that had been the Cau&s;e of all the Mi&s;chief, and of another that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out of their Pain; then the Man that was not hurt at all, came and kneel'd down to them, with his two Hands
<PB N="103" REF="112">
held up, and made piteous Moans to them by Ge&s;tures and Signs, for his Life; but could not &s;ay one Word to them that they could under|&s;tand.</P>
<P>However, they &s;ign'd to him to &s;it down at the Foot of a Tree thereby; and one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, with a Piece of Rope-Twine which he had, by great Chance, in his Pocket, ty'd his two Feet fa&s;t together, and his two Hands be|hind him, and there they left him; and, with what Speed they could, made after the other two, which were gone before; fearing they, or any more of them, &s;hould find the Way to their cover'd Place in the Woods, where their Wives, and the few Goods they had left, lay. They came once in Sight of the two Men, but it was at a great Di&s;tance; however, they had the Satisfaction to &s;ee them cro&s;s over a Valley towards the Sea, the quite con|trary Way from that which led to their Retreat, which they were afraid of; and being &s;atisfy'd with that, they went back to the Tree, where they left their Pri&s;oner, who, as they &s;uppos'd, was deliver'd by his Comrades; for he was gone, and the two Pieces of Rope-Yarn, with which they had bound him, lay ju&s;t at the Foot of the Tree.</P>
<P>They were now in as great a Concern as before, not knowing what Cour&s;e to take, or how near the Enemy might be, or in what Numbers; &s;o they re&s;olv'd to go away to the Place where their Wives were, to &s;ee if all was well there, and to make them ea&s;y, who were in Fright enough to be &s;ure; for tho' the Savages were their own Country Folk, yet they were mo&s;t terribly afraid of them, and
<PB N="104" REF="113">
perhaps the more, for the Knowledge they had of them.</P>
<P>When they came there, they found the Savages had been in the Wood, and very near that Place, but had not found it; for it was indeed inacce&s;&s;i|ble, by the Trees &s;tanding &s;o thick, <HI>as before,</HI> had not the Per&s;ons &s;eeking it been directed by tho&s;e that knew it, which the&s;e did not; they found therefore every Thing very &s;afe, only the Women in a terrible Fright: While they were here, they had the Comfort to have &s;even of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; the other ten, with their Servants, and old <HI>Friday,</HI> I mean <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father, were gone in a Body to defend their Bower, and the Corn, and Cattle that was kept there, in Ca&s;e the Savages &s;hould have rov'd over to that Side of the Country; but they did not &s;pread &s;o far. With the &s;even <HI>Spaniards</HI> came one of the three Savages, who, as I &s;aid, were their Pri&s;oners formerly; and with them al&s;o came the Savage, who the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men had left bound Hand and Foot at the Tree; for it &s;eems they came that Way, &s;aw the Slaughter of the &s;even Men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them; where, however, they were oblig'd to bind him again, as they had the two others, who were left when the third run away.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oners began now to be a Burden to them; and they were &s;o afraid of their e&s;caping, that they were once re&s;olving to kill them all, be|lieving they were under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to do &s;o, for their own Pre&s;ervation: However, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governour would not con&s;ent to it, but order'd for the pre&s;ent, that they &s;hould be &s;ent out of the Way to my old Cave in the Valley, and
<PB N="105" REF="114">
be kept there with two <HI>Spaniards</HI> to guard them, and give them Food for their Sub&s;i&s;tence, which was done; and they were bound there Hand and Foot for that Night.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came, the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men were &s;o encourag'd, that they could not &s;atisfy them&s;elves to &s;tay any longer there; but taking five of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and them&s;elves, with four Mu&s;kets and a Pi&s;tol among them, and two &s;tout Quarter-Staves, away they went in Que&s;t of the Savages. And fir&s;t they came to the Tree where the Men lay that had been kill'd; but it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that &s;ome more of the Savages had been there; for they had attempted to carry their dead Men away, and had dragg'd two of them a good Way, but had given it over. From thence they advanc'd to the fir&s;t ri&s;ing Ground, where they &s;tood, and &s;aw their Camp de&s;troy'd, and where they had the Mor|tification &s;till to &s;ee &s;ome of the Smoak; but nei|ther could they here &s;ee any of the Savages: They then re&s;olv'd, tho' with all po&s;&s;ible Caution, to go forward towards their ruin'd Plantation: But a little before they came thither, coming in Sight of the Sea Shore, they &s;aw plainly the Savages all embarking again in their Canoes, in order to be gone.</P>
<P>They &s;eem'd &s;orry at fir&s;t; and there was no Way to come at them, to give them a parting Blow: But upon the whole, were very well &s;ati&s;|fy'd to be rid of them.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men being now twice ruin'd, and all their Improvement de&s;troy'd, the re&s;t all agreed to come and help them rebuild, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with needful Supplies. Their three
<PB N="106" REF="115">
Countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the lea&s;t Inclination to do any Good, yet as &s;oon as they heard of it (for they living remote Ea&s;t|ward, knew nothing of the Matter 'till all was over) came and offer'd their Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and did very friendly work for &s;everal Days, to re&s;tore their Habitation, and make Nece&s;&s;aries for them: And thus, in a little Time, they were &s;et upon their Legs again.</P>
<P>About two Days after this, they had the far|ther Satisfaction of &s;eeing three of the Savages Canoes come driving on Shore, and at &s;ome Di|&s;tance from them; two drown'd Men; by which they had Rea&s;on to believe, that they had met with a Storm at Sea, and had over&s;et &s;ome of them; for it had blown very hard the very Night after they went off.</P>
<P>However, as &s;ome might mi&s;carry, &s;o on the other Hand, enough of them e&s;cap'd to inform the re&s;t, as well of what they had done, as of what had happen'd to them; and to whet them on to a|nother Enterprize of the &s;ame Nature, which they, it &s;eems, re&s;olv'd to attempt, with &s;ufficient Force to carry all before them; for except what the fir&s;t Man had told them of Inhabitants, they could &s;ay little to it of their own Knowledge; for they ne|ver &s;aw one Man, and the Fellow being kill'd that had affirm'd it, they had no other Witne&s;s to confirm it to them.</P>
<P>It was five or &s;ix Months after this, before they heard any more of the Savages; in which Time our Men were in Hopes they had either forgot their former bad Luck, or given over the Hopes of better; when on a &s;udden they were invaded
<PB N="107" REF="116">
with a mo&s;t formidable Fleet, of no le&s;s than eight and twenty Canoes full of Savages, arm'd with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden Swords, and &s;uch like Engines of War; and they brought &s;uch Numbers with them, that, in &s;hort, it put all our People into the utmo&s;t Con|&s;ternation.</P>
<P>As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t Side of the I&s;land, our Men had that Night to con&s;ult and con&s;ider what to do; and, in the fir&s;t Place, knowing that their being en|tirely conceal'd, was their only Safety before, and would much more be &s;o now, while the Number of their Enemies was &s;o great, they therefore re&s;olv'd fir&s;t of all to take down the Huts which were built for the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and drive away their Goats to the old Cave; becau&s;e they &s;uppos'd the Savages would go directly thither, as &s;oon as it was Day, to play the old Game over again, tho' they did not now land within two Leagues of it.</P>
<P>In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of Goats they had at the old Bower, as I call'd it, which belong'd to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and, in &s;hort, left as little Appearance of Inhabitants any where as was po&s;&s;ible; and the next Morning early they po&s;ted them&s;elves with all their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, waiting for their Coming: As they gue&s;s'd, &s;o it happen'd; the&s;e new Invaders leaving their Canoes at the Ea&s;t End of the I&s;land, came ranging along the Shore directly towards the Place, to the Number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our Men could judge. Our Army was but &s;mall indeed; but that which was wor&s;e, they had not Arms for all their Number neither: The

<P>To their Slaves they did not give either Mu&s;|ket or Fuzee, but they had every one a Halberd, or a long Staff, like a Quarter-Staff, with a great Spike of Iron fa&s;ten'd into each End of it, and by his Side a Hatchet; al&s;o every one of our Men had Hatchets: Two of the Women could not be prevail'd upon but they would come into the Fight, and they had Bows and Arrows, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken from the Savages, when the fir&s;t Action happen'd, which I have &s;poken of, where the <HI>Indians</HI> fought with one another, and the Women Hatchets too.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governour, who I have de|&s;crib'd &s;o often, commanded the whole; and <HI>William Atkins,</HI> who, tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickedne&s;s, was a mo&s;t daring bold Fellow,
<PB N="109" REF="118">
commanded under him. The Savages came forward like Lyons, and our Men, which was the wor&s;t of their Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation; only that <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> who now prov'd a mo&s;t u&s;eful Fellow, with &s;ix Men, was planted ju&s;t behind a &s;mall Thicket of Bu&s;hes, as an advanc'd Guard, with Orders to let the fir&s;t of them pa&s;s by, and then fire into the Mid|dle of them; and, as &s;oon as he had fir'd, to make his Retreat as nimble as he could round a Part of the Wood, and &s;o come in behind the <HI>Spaniards</HI> where they &s;tood, having a Thic|ket of Trees all before them.</P>
<P>When the Savages came on, they run &s;trag|gling about every Way in Heaps, out of all man|ner of Order, and <HI>W. Atkins</HI> let about fifty of them pa&s;s by him, then &s;eeing the re&s;t come in a very thick Throng, he orders three of his Men to fire, having loaded their Mu&s;quets with &s;ix or &s;even Bullets apiece, about as big as large Pi&s;tol Bullets. How many they kill'd or wounded they knew not, but the Con&s;ternation and Sur|prize was inexpre&s;&s;ible among the Savages; they were frighted to the la&s;t Degree, to hear &s;uch a dreadful Noi&s;e, and &s;ee their Men kill'd, and others hurt, but &s;ee no Body that did it; when in the Middle of their Fright, <HI>W. Atkins,</HI> and his other three, let fly again among the thicke&s;t of them; and in le&s;s than a Minute the fir&s;t three, being loaded again, gave them a third Volley.</P>
<P>Had <HI>W. Atkins</HI> and his Men retir'd immedi|ately, as &s;oon as they had fir'd, as they were or|der'd to do; or had the re&s;t of the Body been at Hand to have pour'd in their Shot continually,
<PB N="110" REF="119">
the Savages had been effectually routed; for the Terror that was among them, came princi|pally from this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That they were kill'd by the Gods with Thunder and Lightning, and could &s;ee no Body that hurt them; but <HI>W. At|kins</HI> &s;taying to load again, di&s;cover'd the Cheat. Some of the Savages who were at a Di&s;tance, &s;pying them, came upon them behind, and tho' <HI>Atkins</HI> and his Men fir'd at them al&s;o, two or three Times, and kill'd above twenty, retiring as fa&s;t as they could, yet they wounded <HI>Atkins</HI> him|&s;elf, and kill'd one of his Fellow <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> with their Arrows, as they did afterwards one <HI>Spani|ard,</HI> and one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves who came with the Women; this Slave was a mo&s;t gallant Fel|low, and fought mo&s;t de&s;perately, killing five of them with his own Hand, having no Weapon, but one of the arm'd Staves and a Hatchet.</P>
<P>Our Men being thus hard laid at, <HI>Atkins</HI> wounded, and two other Men kill'd, retreated to a ri&s;ing Ground in the Wood; and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> after firing three Vollies upon them retreated al&s;o; for their Number was &s;o great, and they were &s;o de&s;perate, that tho' above fifty of them were kill'd, and more than &s;o many wounded, yet they came on in the Teeth of our Men, fearle&s;s of Danger, and &s;hot their Arrows like a Cloud; and it was ob&s;erv'd, that their wounded Men, who were not quite di&s;abled, were made outrage|ous by their Wounds, and fought like Mad|men.</P>
<P>When our Men retreated, they left the <HI>Spani|ard</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> that was kill'd behind them; and the Savages, when they came up to them, kill'd them over again in a wretched

Manner, breaking the Arms, Legs, and Heads, with their Clubs and wooden Swords, like true Savages: But finding our Men were gone, they did not &s;eem to per&s;ue them, but drew them|&s;elves up in a kind of a Ring, which is, it &s;eems, their Cu&s;tom, and &s;houted twice in Token of their Victory: After which, they had the Mortificati|on to &s;ee &s;everal of their wounded Men fall, dying with the meer Lo&s;s of Blood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governor having drawn his little Body up together upon a ri&s;ing Ground, <HI>Atkins,</HI> tho' he was wounded, would ha' had him march'd and charg'd them again altogether at once: But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> reply'd, Seignior <HI>Atkins,</HI> you &s;ee how their wounded Men fight, let them alone till Morning; all the&s;e wounded Men will be &s;tiff and &s;ore with their Wounds, and faint with the Lo&s;s of Blood; and &s;o we &s;hall have the fewer to engage.</P>
<P>The Advice was good: But <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> reply'd merrily, That's true, Seignior, and &s;o &s;hall I too; and that's the Rea&s;on I would go on while I am warm. Well, Seignior <HI>Atkins,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> you have behav'd gallantly, and done your Part; we will fight for you, if you cannot come on, but I think it be&s;t to &s;tay 'till Morning; &s;o they waited.</P>
<P>But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they found the Savages in great Di&s;order about their dead and wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noi&s;e among them where they lay, they afterwards re&s;olv'd to fall upon them in the Night, e&s;peci|ally if they could come to give them but one Volley before they were di&s;cover'd, which they
<PB N="112" REF="121">
had a fair Opportunity to do; for one of the two <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> in who&s;e Quarter it was where the Fight began, led them round between the Woods, and Sea-&s;ide We&s;tward, and then turning &s;hort South, they came &s;o near where the thicke&s;t of them lay, that before they were &s;een or heard, eight of them fir'd in among them, and did dread|ful Execution upon them; in half a Minute more, eight others fir'd after them, pouring in their &s;mall Shot in &s;uch a Quantity, that abundance were kill'd and wounded; and all this while they were not able to &s;ee who hurt them, or which Way to fly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> charg'd again with the utmo&s;t Expedition, and then divided them&s;elves into three Bodies, and re&s;olv'd to fall in among them altogether: They had in each Body eight Per&s;ons, that is to &s;ay, 24, whereof were 22 Men, and the 2 Women, who by the Way fought de&s;perately.</P>
<P>They divided the Fire-Arms equally in each Party, and &s;o of the Halberds and Staves: They would have had the Women keep back, but they &s;aid they were re&s;olv'd to die with their Hu&s;bands: Having thus form'd their little Army, they march'd out from among the Trees, and they came up to the Teeth of the Enemy, &s;houting and hollowing as loud as they could; the Savages &s;tood all toge|ther, but were in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, hearing the Noi&s;e of our Men &s;houting from three Quar|ters together; they would have fought if they had &s;een us: And as &s;oon as we came near enough to be &s;een, &s;ome Arrows were &s;hot, and poor old <HI>Friday</HI> was wounded, tho' not dangerou&s;ly: But our Men gave them no Time; but running up to them, fir'd among them three Ways, and
<PB N="113" REF="122">
then fell in with the But-ends of their Mu&s;kets, their Swords, arm'd Staves, and Hatchets, and laid about them &s;o well, that, in a Word they &s;et up a di&s;mal Skreaming and Howling, flying to &s;ave their Lives which Way &s;oever they could.</P>
<P>Our Men were tir'd with the Execution; and kill'd, or mortally wounded, in the two Fights, about 180 of them; the re&s;t, being frighted out of their Wits, &s;cour'd through the Woods, and over the Hills, with all the Speed and Fear that nimble Feet could help them to do; and as we did not trouble our&s;elves much to pur&s;ue them, they got altogether to the Sea Side, where they landed, and where their Canoes lay. But their Di&s;a&s;ter was not at an End yet; for it blew a ter|rible Storm of Wind that Evening from the Seaward, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to go off; nay, the Storm continuing all Night, when the Tide came up, their Canoes were mo&s;t of them driven by the Surge of the Sea &s;o high upon the Shore, that it requir'd infinite Toil to get them off; and &s;ome of them were even da&s;h d to Pieces again&s;t the Beach, or again&s;t one another.</P>
<P>Our Men, tho' glad of their Victory, yet got little Re&s;t that Night; but having refre&s;h'd them|&s;elves as well as they could they re&s;olv'd to march to that Part of the I&s;land where the Savages were fled, and &s;ee what Po&s;ture they were in. This nece&s;&s;arily led them over the Place where the Fight had been, and where they found &s;everal of the poor Creatures not quite dead, and yet pa&s;t re|covering Life; a Sight di&s;agreeable enough to generous Minds; for a truly great Man, tho' obli|ged by the Law of Battle to de&s;troy his Enemy, takes no Delight in his Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="123">
However, there was no Need to give any Or|ders in this Ca&s;e; for their own Savages, who were their Servants, di&s;patch'd tho&s;e poor Crea|tures with their Hatchets.</P>
<P>At length they came in View of the Place where the more mi&s;erable Remains of the Savages Army lay, where there appear'd about an hundred &s;till; their Po&s;ture was generally &s;itting upon the Ground, with their Knees up towards their Mouth, and the Head put between the two Hands, leaning down upon the Knees.</P>
<P>When our Men came within two Mu&s;ket Shot of them, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governor order'd two Mu&s;|kets to be fir'd without Ball, to alarm them; this he did, that by their Countenance he might know what to expect, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether they were &s;till in Heart to fight, or were &s;o heartily beaten, as to be di&s;pirited and di&s;courag'd, and &s;o he might manage accordingly.</P>
<P>This Stratagem took; for, as &s;oon as the Sava|ges heard the fir&s;t Gun, and &s;aw the Fla&s;h of the Second, they &s;tarted up upon their Feet in the greate&s;t Con&s;ternation imaginable; and as our Men advanc'd &s;wiftly towards them, they all ran &s;kreaming and yawling away, with a Kind of a howling Noi&s;e, which our Men did not under|&s;tand, and had never heard before; and thus they ran up the Hills into the Country.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, our Men had much rather the Weather had been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea: But they did not then con&s;ider that this might probably have been the Occa&s;ion of their

coming again in &s;uch Multitudes, as not to be re&s;i&s;ted, or, at lea&s;t, to come &s;o many, and &s;o of|ten, as would quite de&s;olate the I&s;land, and &s;tarve them: <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> therefore, who, notwith&s;tand|ing his Wound, kept always with them, prov'd the be&s;t Coun&s;ellor in this Ca&s;e: His Advice was, to take the Advantage that offer'd, and clap in between them and their Boats, and &s;o deprive them of the Capacity of ever returning any more to plague the I&s;land.</P>
<P>They con&s;ulted long about this, and &s;ome were again&s;t it, for fear of making the Wretches fly to the Woods, and live there de&s;perate; and &s;o they &s;hould have them to hunt like wild Bea&s;ts, be afraid to &s;tir out about their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and have their Plantations continually rifled, all their tame Goats de&s;troy'd, and, in &s;hort, be reduc'd to a Life of continual Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Will. Atkins</HI> told them, they had better have to do with a hundred Men, than with a hundred Nations: That as they mu&s;t de&s;troy their Boats, &s;o they mu&s;t de&s;troy the Men, or be all of them de&s;troy'd them&s;elves. In a Word, he &s;hew'd them the Nece&s;&s;ity of it &s;o plainly, that they all came into it; &s;o they went to work immediate|ly with the Boats, and getting &s;ome dry Wood together from a dead Tree, they try'd to &s;et &s;ome of them on Fire, but they were &s;o wet, that they would not burn; however, the Fire &s;o burn'd the upper Part, that it &s;oon made them unfit for &s;wimming in the Sea as Boats. When the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aw what they were about, &s;ome of them came running out of the Woods, and coming as near as they could to our Men, kneel'd down, and cry'd, <HI>Oa, Oa, Waramokoa,</HI> and &s;ome other Words of
<PB N="116" REF="125">
their Language, which none of the others under|&s;tood anything of; but as they made pitiful Ge|&s;tures, and &s;trange Noi&s;es, it was ea&s;y to under|&s;tand, they begg'd to have their Boats &s;par'd, and that they would be gone, and never come there again.</P>
<P>But our Men were now &s;atisfy'd, that they had no Way to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, or to &s;ave their Colony, but effectually to prevent any of the&s;e People from ever going Home again; de|pending upon this, that if ever &s;o much as one of them got back into their Country to tell the Story, the Colony was undone; &s;o that letting them know that they &s;hould not have any Mer|cy, they fell to work with their Canoes, and de|&s;troy'd them every one, that the Storm had not de&s;troy'd before; at the Sight of which, the Sa|vages rais'd a hideous Cry in the Woods, which our People heard plain enough; after which, they ran about the I&s;land like di&s;tracted Men; &s;o that, in a Word, our Men did not really know at fir&s;t what to do with them.</P>
<P>Nor did the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with all their Pru|dence, con&s;ider, that while they made tho&s;e People thus de&s;perate, they ought to have kept good Guard at the &s;ame Time upon their Platnations; for tho' it is true, they had driven away their Cattle, and the <HI>Indians</HI> did not find out their main Retreat, I mean my old Ca&s;tle at the Hill, nor the Cave in the Valley, yet they found out my Plantation at the Bower, and pull'd it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and Planting about it; trod all the Corn under Foot; tore up the Vines and Grapes, being ju&s;t then almo&s;t ripe, and did to our Men an ine|&s;timable
<PB N="117" REF="126">
Damage, tho' to them&s;elves not one Far|thingworth of Service.</P>
<P>Tho' our Men were able to fight them upon all Occa&s;ions, yet they were in no Condition to pur&s;ue them, or hunt them up and down; for as they were too nimble of Foot for our Men, when they found them &s;ingle, &s;o our Men dur&s;t not go about &s;ingle, for fear of being &s;urrounded with their Numbers. The be&s;t was, they had no Weapons, for tho' they had Bows they had no Arrows left, nor any Materials to make any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or Weapon among them.</P>
<P>The Extremity and Di&s;tre&s;s they were reduc'd to was great, and indeed deplorable; but at the &s;ame Time, our Men were al&s;o brought to very bad Circum&s;tances by them; for tho' their Re|treats were pre&s;erv'd, yet their Provi&s;ion was de&s;troy'd, and their Harve&s;t &s;poil'd, and what to do, or which Way to turn them&s;elves, they knew not: The only Refuge they had now, was the Stock of Cattle they had in the Valley by the Cave, and &s;ome little Corn which grew there; and the Plantation of the three <HI>Engli&s;hmen, William At|kins</HI> and his Comrades, who were now reduc'd to two, one of them being kill'd by an Arrow which &s;truck him on the Side of his Head, ju&s;t under the Temple, &s;o that he never &s;poke more; and it was very remarkable, that this was the &s;ame barbarous Fellow who cut the poor Savage Slave with his Hatchet, and who afterwards in|tended to have murder'd all the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="127">
I look'd upon their Ca&s;e to have been wor&s;e, at this Time, than mine was at any Time, after I fir&s;t di&s;cover'd the Grains of Barley and Rice, and got into the Manner of planting and rai&s;ing my Corn, and my tame Cattle; for now they had, as I may &s;ay, a hundred Wolves upon the I&s;land, which would devour every Thing they could come at, yet could very hardly be come at them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing they concluded, when they &s;aw what their Circum&s;tances were, was, that they would, if po&s;&s;ible, drive them up to the farther Part of the I&s;land, South-We&s;t, that if any more Savages came on Shore, they might not find one another. Then, that they would daily hunt and hara&s;s them, and kill as many of them as they could come at, till they had reduc'd their Num|ber; and if they could at la&s;t tame them, and bring them to any Thing, they would give them Corn, and teach them how to plant and live up|on their daily Labour.</P>
<P>In order to this, they &s;o follow'd them, and &s;o terrify'd them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of them fir'd a Gun at an <HI>Indian,</HI> if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for Fear: and &s;o dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of Sight farther and farther, till at la&s;t our Men following them, and every Day al|mo&s;t killing and wounding &s;ome of them, they kept up in the Woods and hollow Places &s;o much, that it reduc'd them to the utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery for want of Food, and many were afterwards found dead in the Woods, without any Hurt, but meer|ly &s;tarv'd to Death.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="128">
When our Men found this, it made their Hearts relent, and Pity mov'd them; e&s;pecially the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governour, who was the mo&s;t gentle|manly generous-minded Man as ever I met with in my Life; and he propos'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to take one of them alive, and bring him to under&s;tand what they meant, &s;o far as to be able to act as Interpreter, and to go among them, and &s;ee if they might be brought to &s;ome Conditions, that might be depended upon, to &s;ave their Lives, and to do us no Spoil.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome while before any of them could be taken; but being weak and half &s;tarv'd, one of them was at la&s;t &s;urpriz'd and made a Pri&s;o|ner; he was &s;ullen at fir&s;t, and would neither eat or drink, but finding him&s;elf kindly u&s;ed, and Victuals given him, and no Violence offer'd him, he at la&s;t grew tractable, and came to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>They brought old <HI>Friday</HI> to him, who talk'd often with him, and told him how kind the other would be to them all; that they would not only &s;ave their Lives, but would give them a Part of the I&s;land to live in, provided they would give Satisfaction that they would keep in their own Bounds, and not come beyond it, to injure or prejudice others, and that they &s;hould have Corn given them, to plant and make it grow for their Bread, and &s;ome Bread given them for their pre|&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tence; and old <HI>Friday</HI> bad the Fellow go and talk with the re&s;t of his Countrymen, and &s;ee what they &s;aid to it, a&s;&s;uring them, that if they did not agree immediately, they &s;hould be all de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="129">
The poor Wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduc'd in Number to about thirty &s;even, clos'd with the Propo&s;al at the fir&s;t Offer, and begg'd to have &s;ome Food given them; upon which, twelve <HI>Spaniards</HI> and two <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> well arm'd, with three <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves, and old <HI>Friday,</HI> march'd to the Place where they were; the three <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves carry'd them a large Quantity of Bread; &s;ome Rice boil'd up to Cakes, and dry'd in the Sun and three live Goats; and they were or|der'd to go to the Side of a Hill, where they &s;at down, eat the Provi&s;ions very thankfully, and were the mo&s;t faithful Fellows to their Words that could be thought of; for except when they came to beg Victuals and Directions, they never came out of their Bounds; and there they liv'd when I came to the I&s;land, and I went to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>They had taught them both to plant Corn, make Bread, breed tame Goats and milk them; they wanted nothing but Wives, and they &s;oon would have been a Nation. They were con|fin'd to a Neck of Land, &s;urrounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain towards the Sea before them, on the South-Ea&s;t Corner of the I&s;land: They had Land enough, and it was very good and fruitful; they had a Piece of Land about a Mile and half broad, three or four Mile in Length.</P>
<P>Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, &s;uch as I made for my&s;elf, and gave them among them twelve Hatchets and three or four Knives; and there they liv'd the mo&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="130">
&s;ubjected innocent Creatures that ever were heard of.</P>
<P>After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfect Tran|quility with Re&s;pect to the Savages, till I came to revi&s;it them, which was above two Years: Not, but that now and then &s;ome Canoes of Sa|vages came on Shore for their triumphal unnatu|ral Fea&s;ts, but as they were of &s;everal Nations, and perhaps had never heard of tho&s;e that came before, or the Rea&s;on of it, they did not make any Search or Enquiry after their Countrymen; and if they had, it would have been very hard to have found them out.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all that happen'd to them, to my Return, at lea&s;t that was worth Notice. The <HI>Indians</HI> or Sa|vages were wonderfully civiliz'd by them, and they frequently went among them, but forbid, on Pain of Death, any one of the <HI>Indians</HI> coming to them, becau&s;e they would not have their Set|tlement betray'd again.</P>
<P>One Thing was very remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> that they taught the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Ba&s;kets; but they &s;oon outdid their Ma&s;ters; for they made abundance of mo&s;t ingenious Things in Wicker-work; particularly, all Sorts of Ba&s;kets, Sieves, Bird-Cages, Cup-boards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o Chairs to &s;it on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and abundance of other Things, being very in|genious at &s;uch Work, when they were once put in the Way of it.</P>
<P>My coming was a particular Relief to the&s;e People, becau&s;e we furni&s;h'd them with Knives,
<PB N="122" REF="131">
Sci&s;&s;ars, Spades, Shovels, Pick axes, and all Things of that Kind which they could want.</P>
<P>With the Help of the&s;e Tools they were &s;o very handy, that they came at la&s;t to build up their Huts, or our Hou&s;es, very hand&s;omely; raddling or working it up like Ba&s;ket-work all the way round, which was a very extra|ordinary Piece of Ingenuity, and look'd very odd, but was an exceeding good Fence, as well again&s;t Heat, as again&s;t all Sorts of Vermine; and our Men were &s;o taken with it, that they got the wild Savages to come and do the like for them; &s;o that when I came to &s;ee the two <HI>Engli&s;hmens</HI> Colonies, they look'd, at a Di&s;tance, as if they liv'd all like Bees in a Hive; and as for <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> who was now become a very in|du&s;trious nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ober Fellow, he had made him&s;elf &s;uch a Tent of Ba&s;ket-work as I believe was never &s;een; it was 120 Paces round in the Out-&s;ide, as I mea&s;ur'd by my Steps; the Walls were as clo&s;e work'd as a Ba&s;ket in Pannels, or Squares of 32 in Number, and very &s;trong, &s;tanding about &s;even Foot high; in the middle was another not above 22 Paces round, but built &s;tronger, being Eight-&s;quare in its Form, and in the eight Corners &s;tood eight very &s;trong Po&s;ts, round the Top of which he laid &s;trong Pieces pinn'd together with wooden Pins, from which he rais'd a Piramid for the Roof of eight Rafters, very hand&s;ome, I a&s;&s;ure you, and join'd together very well, tho' he had no Nails, and only a few iron Spikes, which he made him|&s;elf too, out of the old Iron that I had left there; and indeed this Fellow &s;hew'd abundance of Ingenuity in &s;everal Things, which he had no Knowledge of; he made him a Forge, with
<PB N="123" REF="132">
a Pair of wooden Bellows to blow the Fire; he made him&s;elf Charcoal for his Work, and he form'd out of one of the Iron Crows a middling good Anvil to hammer upon; in this Manner he made many Things, but e&s;pecially Hooks, Staples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges. But to re|turn to the Hou&s;e; after he had pitch'd the Roof of his innermo&s;t Tent, he work'd it up be|tween the Rafters with Ba&s;ket-work, &s;o firm, and thatch'd that over again &s;o ingeniou&s;ly with Rice-&s;traw, and over that a large Leaf of a Tree, which cover'd the Top, that his Hou&s;e was as dry as if it had been til'd or &s;lated. In|deed he own'd that the Savages made the Ba&s;ket-work for him.</P>
<P>The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-too, all round this inner Apartment, and long Rafters lay from the two and thirty Angles to the top Po&s;ts of the inner Hou&s;e, being about twenty Foot Di&s;tant; &s;o that there was a Space like a Walk within the outer Wicker-wall, and without the in|ner, near twenty Foot wide.</P>
<P>The inner Place he partition'd off with the &s;ame Wicker-work, but much fairer, and di|vided it into &s;ix Apartments, &s;o that he had &s;ix Rooms on a Floor; and out of every one of the&s;e there was a Door, fir&s;t into the Entry or Coming into the main Tent, and another Door into the Space or Walk that was round it; &s;o that Walk was al&s;o divided into &s;ix equal Parts, which &s;erv'd not only for Retreat, but to &s;tore up any Nece&s;&s;aries which the Family had Oc|ca&s;ion for. The&s;e &s;ix Spaces not taking up the whole Circumference, what other Apartments the outer Circle had, were thus order'd: As &s;oon
<PB N="124" REF="133">
as you were in at the Door of the outer Circle, you had a &s;hort Pa&s;&s;age &s;trait before you to the Door of the inner Hou&s;e, but on either Side was a wicker Partition, and a Door in it, by which you went, fir&s;t, into a large Room or Store-hou&s;e, twenty Foot wide, and about thir|ty Foot long, and thro' that into another not quite &s;o long; &s;o that in the outer Circle was ten hand&s;ome Rooms, &s;ix of which were on|ly to be come at thro' the Apartments of the inner Tent, and &s;erv'd as Clo&s;ets or retiring Rooms to the re&s;pective Chambers of the inner Circle; and four large Ware-hou&s;es or Barns, or what you plea&s;e to call them, which went in thro' one another, two on either Hand of the Pa&s;&s;age, that led thro' the outer Door to the in|ner Tent.</P>
<P>Such a Piece of Ba&s;ket-work, I believe, was never &s;een in the World, nor a Hou&s;e, or Tent, &s;o neatly contriv'd, much le&s;s, &s;o built. In this great Bee-hive liv'd the three Families, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> and his Companion; the third was kill'd, but his Wife remain'd with three Children; for &s;he was, it &s;eems, big with Child when he dy'd, and the other two were not at all backward to give the Widow her full Share of every Thing, I mean, as to their Corn, Milk, Grapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when they kill'd a Kid, or found a Turtle on the Shore; &s;o that they all liv'd well enough, tho' it was true, they were not &s;o indu&s;trious as the other two, as has been ob&s;erv'd already.</P>
<P>One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, <HI>viz.</HI> That as for Religion, I don't know that there was any Thing of that Kind among them; they
<PB N="125" REF="134">
pretty often indeed put one another in Mind that there was a God, by the very common Method of Seamen, <HI>viz.</HI> Swearing by his Name: Nor were their poor ignorant &s;avage Wives much the better for having been marry'd to Chri&s;tians, as we mu&s;t call them; for as they knew very little of God them&s;elves, &s;o they were utterly uncapa|ble of entring into any Di&s;cour&s;e with their Wives about a God, or to talk anything to them con|cerning Religion.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t of all the Improvement which I can &s;ay the Wives had made from them, was, that they had taught them to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pret|ty well, and all the Children they had, which was near 20 in all, were taught to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> too, from their fir&s;t learning to &s;peak, tho' they at fir&s;t &s;poke it in a very broken Manner, like their Mothers. There were none of the&s;e Chil|dren above &s;ix Years old when I came thither, for it was not much above &s;even Years that they had fetch'd the&s;e five &s;avage Ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all Children, more or le&s;s: I think the Cook's Mate's Wife was big of her &s;ixth Child; and the Mothers were all a good Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborious Wo|men, mode&s;t and decent, helpful to one another; mighty ob&s;ervant and &s;ubject to their Ma&s;ters, I cannot call them Hu&s;bands; and wanted nothing but to be well in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, and to be legally marry'd; both which were happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at lea&s;t, in Con&s;equence of my coming among them.</P>

<P>I had a great many Di&s;cour&s;es with them about their Circum&s;tances when they were among the Savages: They told me readily, that they had no In&s;tances to give of their Application or Inge|nuity in that Country; that they were a poor mi&s;erable dejected Handful of People; that if Means had been put into their Hands, they had yet &s;o abandon'd them&s;elves to De&s;pair, and &s;o &s;unk under the Weight of their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but Starving: One of them, a grave and very &s;en&s;ible Man, told me, he was convinc'd they were in the wrong; that it was not the Part of wi&s;e Men to give up them&s;elves to their Mi&s;ery, but always to take Hold of the Helps which Rea&s;on offer'd, as well for pre&s;ent Sup|port, as for future Deliverance. He told me that Grief was the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s in&s;ignificant Pa&s;&s;ion in the World; for that it regarded only Things pa&s;t, which were generally impo&s;&s;ible to be re|call'd or to be remedy'd, but had no View to Things to come, and had no Share in any Thing that look'd like Deliverance, but rather added to the Affliction, than propos'd a Remedy: And up|on this, he repeated a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb; which tho' I cannot repeat in ju&s;t the &s;ame Words that he &s;poke in, yet I remember I made it into an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb of my own, thus:
<Q><L><HI>In Trouble to be troubl'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is to have your Trouble doubl'd.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="136">
He ran on then in Remarks upon all the little Improvements I had made in my Solitude; my unweary'd Application, as he call'd it, and how I had made a Condition, which, in its Circum&s;tan|ces, was at fir&s;t much wor&s;e than theirs a thou|&s;and Times, more happy than theirs was, even now, when they were all together. He told me, it was remarkable, that <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> had a greater Pre&s;ence of Mind in their Di&s;tre&s;s than any People that ever he met with; that their unhappy Na|tion, and the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> were the wor&s;t Men in the World to &s;truggle with Misfortunes; for that their fir&s;t Step in Dangers, after the common Ef|forts are over, was always to de&s;pair, lie down under it, and die, without rou&s;ing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies for E&s;cape.</P>
<P>I told him, their Ca&s;e and mine differ'd exceed|ingly, that they were ca&s;t upon the Shore without Nece&s;&s;aries, without Supply of Food, or of pre|&s;ent Su&s;tenance, 'till they could provide: That it is true, I had this Di&s;advantage and Di&s;comfort, that I was alone; but then the Supplies I had pro|videntially thrown into my Hands, by the unex|pected driving of the Ship on Shore, was &s;uch a Help as would have encourag'd any Creature in the World to have apply'd him&s;elf as I had done. Seignior, &s;ays the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> had we poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> been in your Ca&s;e, we &s;hould never have gotten half tho&s;e Things out of the Ship as you did: Nay, &s;ays he, we &s;hould never have found Means to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to have gotten the Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail; and how much le&s;s &s;hould we have done, &s;aid he, if any of us had been alone? Well, I de&s;ir'd him to abate his Compliment, and go on with the Hi|&s;tory of their coming on Shore, where they land|ed,
<PB N="128" REF="137">
he told me, they unhappily landed at a Place where there were People without Provi&s;ions; whereas had they had the common Sen&s;e to have put off to Sea again, and gone to another I&s;land a little farther, they had found Provi&s;ions, tho' without People; there being an I&s;land that Way, as they have been told, where there was Provi|&s;ions, tho' no People; that is to &s;ay, that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> of <HI>Trinidad</HI> had frequently been there, and had fill'd the I&s;land with Goats and Hogs at &s;eve|ral Times; where they have bred in &s;uch Multi|tudes, and where Turtle and Sea-Fowls were in &s;uch Plenty, that they could ha' been in no Want of Fle&s;h, tho' they had found no Bread; whereas here, they were only &s;u&s;tain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, which they under&s;tood not, and which had no Sub&s;tance in them, and which the Inha|bitants gave them &s;paringly enough, and who could treat them no better, unle&s;s they would turn Canibals, and eat Mens Fle&s;h, which was the great Dainty of their Country.</P>
<P>They gave me an Account how many Ways they &s;trove to civilize the Savages they were with, and to teach them rational Cu&s;toms in the ordi|nary Way of Living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon them, as unju&s;t, that they who came there for A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Support, &s;hould at|tempt to &s;et up for In&s;tructors of tho&s;e that gave them Bread; intimating, it &s;eems, that none &s;hould &s;et up for the In&s;tructors of others, but tho&s;e who could live without them.</P>
<P>They gave me di&s;mal Accounts of the Extremi|ties they were driven to; how &s;ometimes they were many Days without any Food at all; the I&s;land they were upon being inhabited by a Sort
<PB N="129" REF="138">
of Savages that lived more indolent, and for that Rea&s;on were le&s;s &s;upplied with the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, than they had Rea&s;on to believe others were in the &s;ame Part of the World; and yet they found, that the&s;e Savages were le&s;s ravenous and voracious, than tho&s;e who had better Supplies of Food.</P>
<P>Al&s;o they added, That they could not but &s;ee with what Demon&s;trations of Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s the governing Providence of God directs the Events of Things in the World; which, they &s;aid, appear'd in their Circum&s;tances; for if pre&s;s'd by the Hard&s;hips they were under, and the Barrenne&s;s of the Country where they were, they had &s;earch'd after a better Place to live in; they had then been out of the Way of the Relief that happen'd to them by my Means.</P>
<P>Then they gave me an Account, how the Sava|ges, who they liv'd among, expected them to go out with them into their Wars: And it was true, that, as they had Fire-Arms with them, had they not had the Di&s;a&s;ter to lo&s;e their Ammunition, they &s;hould not have been &s;erviceable only to their Friends, but have made them&s;elves terrible both to Friends and Enemies; but being with|out Powder and Shot, and yet in a Condition, that they could not in Rea&s;on deny to go out with their Landlords to their Wars; when they came into the Field of Battle, they were in a wor&s;e Condition than the Savages them&s;elves; for they neither had Bows or Arrows, nor could they u&s;e tho&s;e the Savages gave them; &s;o that they could do nothing but &s;tand &s;till, and be woun|ded with Arrows, till they came up to the Teeth of their Enemy; and then indeed the three Hal|bards
<PB N="130" REF="139">
they had, were of U&s;e to them; and they would often drive a whole little Army before them with tho&s;e Halbards and &s;harpen'd Sticks put into the Muzzles of their Muskets: But that for all this they were &s;ometimes &s;urrounded with Multitudes, and in great Danger from their Ar|rows, till at la&s;t they found the Way to make them&s;elves large Targets of Wood, which they co|ver'd with Skins of wild Bea&s;ts, who&s;e Names they knew not; and the&s;e cover'd them from the Arrows of the Savages; that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, they were &s;ometimes in great Danger, and were once five of them knock'd down together with the Clubs of the Savages, which was the Time when one of them was taken Pri&s;oner; that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Spani|ard,</HI> whom I had reliev'd, that at fir&s;t they thought had been kill'd: But when afterwards they heard he was taken Pri&s;oner, they were under the great|e&s;t Grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventur'd their Lives to have re&s;cu'd him.</P>
<P>They told me, That when they were &s;o knock'd down, the re&s;t of their Company re&s;cu'd them, and &s;tood over them, fighting till they were come to them&s;elves, all but him who they thought had been dead; and then they made their Way with their Halbards and Pieces, &s;tanding clo&s;e together in a Line, thro' a Body of above a thou&s;and Sava|ges, beating down all that came in their Way, got the Victory over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, becau&s;e it was with the Lo&s;s of their Friend; who, the other Party finding him alive, carry'd off with &s;ome others, as I gave an Account in my former.</P>
<P>They de&s;crib'd mo&s;t affectionately, how they were &s;urpriz'd with Joy at the Return of their
<PB N="131" REF="140">
Friend and Companion in Mi&s;ery, who they thought had been devour'd by wild Bea&s;ts of the wor&s;t kind, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by wild Men; and yet how more and more they were &s;urpriz'd with the Account he gave them of his Errand, and that there was a Chri&s;tian in any Place near, much more one that was able, and had Humanity enough to contribute to their Deliverance.</P>
<P>They de&s;crib'd how they were a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Sight of the Relief I &s;ent them, and at the Appea|rance of Loaves of Bread, Things they had not &s;een &s;ince their coming to that mi&s;erable Place; how often they cro&s;s'd it, and ble&s;s'd it, as Bread &s;ent from Heaven; and what a reviving Cordial it was to their Spirits to ta&s;te it; as al&s;o of the other Things I had &s;ent for their Supply. And after all, they would have told me &s;omething of the Joy they were in, at the Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them away to the Per&s;on and Place from whence all the&s;e new Comforts came; but they told me it was impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s it by Words, for their exce&s;&s;ive Joy, naturally driving them to un|becoming Extravagancies, they had no way to de|&s;cribe them, but by telling me that they border'd upon Lunacy, having no way to give Vent to their Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uitable to the Sen&s;e that was upon them; that in &s;ome it work'd one Way, and in &s;ome ano|ther; and that &s;ome of them, thro' a Surprize of Joy, would bur&s;t out into Tears; others be &s;tark mad, and others immediately faint. This Di&s;cour&s;e ex|treamly affected me, and call'd to my Mind <HI>Friday</HI>'s Exta&s;y, when he met his Father, and the poor Peo|ple's Exta&s;y, when I took them up at Sea, after their Ship was on Fire; the Mate of the Ship's Joy, when he found him&s;elf deliver'd in the Place where he expected to peri&s;h; and my own Joy when after 28
<PB N="132" REF="141">
Years Captivity, I found a good Ship ready to car|ry me to my own Country. All the&s;e Things made me more &s;en&s;ible of the Relation of tho&s;e poor Men, and more affected with it.</P>
<P>Having thus given a View of the State of Things, as I found them, I mu&s;t relate the Heads of what I did for the&s;e People, and the Condition in which I left them. It was their Opinion and mine too, that they would be troubled no more with the Savages; or that if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as many as before; &s;o they had no Concern about that. Then I entred into a &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> whom I call Governor, about their Stay in the I&s;land; for as I was not come to carry any of them off, &s;o it would not be ju&s;t to carry off &s;ome, and leave others, who perhaps would be unwilling to &s;tay, if their Strength was dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I told them, I came to e|&s;tabli&s;h them there, not to remove them; and then I let them know, that I had brought with me Re|lief of &s;undry Kinds for them; That I had been at a great Charge to &s;upply them with all Things nece&s;&s;ary, as well for their Convenience, as their Defence; and that I had &s;uch and &s;uch particular Per&s;ons with me, as well to encrea&s;e and recruit their Number, as by the particular nece&s;&s;ary Em|ployments which they were bred to, being Arti|ficers, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in tho&s;e Things, in which, at pre&s;ent, they were to &s;eek.</P>
<P>They were all together when I talk'd thus to them; and before I delivered to them the Stores I had brought, I ask'd them one by one, If they had entirely forgot, and bury'd the fir&s;t Animo&s;i|ties
<PB N="133" REF="142">
that had been among them, and would &s;hake Hands with one another, and engage in a &s;trict Friend&s;hip and Union of Intere&s;t, that &s;o there might be no more Mi&s;under&s;tandings or Jealou|&s;ies.</P>
<P><HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> with abundance of Frankne&s;s and good Humour, &s;aid, They had met with Afflic|tions enough to make them all &s;ober, and Enemies enough to make them all Friends; that for his Part, he would live and die with them; and was &s;o far from de&s;igning any Thing again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that he own'd they had done nothing to him, but what his own mad Humour made nece&s;|&s;ary, and what he would have done, and perhaps much wor&s;e in their Ca&s;e; and that he would ask them Pardon, if I de&s;ir'd it, for the fooli&s;h and bruti&s;h Things he had done to them; and was very willing and de&s;irous of living in Terms of entire Friend&s;hip and Union with them; and would do any thing that lay in his Power to convince them of it; and as for going to <HI>England,</HI> he ear'd not if he did not go thither the&s;e twenty Years.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;aid, They had indeed at fir&s;t di&s;arm'd and excluded <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> and his two Countrymen for their ill Conduct, as they had let me know; and they appeal'd to me, for the Nece&s;&s;ity they were under to do &s;o: But that <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> had behav'd him&s;elf &s;o bravely in the great Fight they had with the Savages, and on &s;everal Occa&s;ions &s;ince; and had &s;hew'd him&s;elf &s;o faithful to, and concern'd for, the general In|tere&s;t of them all, that they had forgotten all that was pa&s;t, and thought he merited as much to be tru&s;ted with Arms, and &s;upply'd with Nece&s;|&s;aries
<PB N="134" REF="143">
as any of them; and that they had te&s;ti|fy'd their Satisfaction in him, by committing the Command to him, next to the Governour him|&s;elf. And as they had an entire Confidence in him and all his Countrymen, &s;o they acknowledg'd they had merited that Confidence by all the Me|thods that hone&s;t Men could merit to be valued, and tru&s;ted; and they mo&s;t heartily embrac'd the Occa&s;ion of giving me this A&s;&s;urance, that they would never have any Intere&s;t &s;eparate from one another.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e frank and open Declarations of Friend&s;hip, we appointed the next Day to dine all together; and indeed we made a &s;plendid Fea&s;t: I cau&s;ed the Ship's Cook and his Mate to come on Shore, and dre&s;s our Dinner; and the old Cook's Mate we had on Shore, a&s;&s;i&s;ted. We brought on Shore &s;ix Pieces of good Beef, and four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's Provi&s;ion, with our Punch-Bowl, and Materials to &s;ill it; and in particular, I gave them ten Bottles of <HI>French</HI> Claret, and ten Bottles of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer; Things that neither the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men had ta&s;ted for many Years; and which, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, they were exceeding glad of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> added to our Fea&s;t five whole Kids, which the Cooks roa&s;ted; and three of them were &s;ent cover'd up clo&s;e on Board the Ship, to the Seamen, that they might fea&s;t on fre&s;h Meat from on Shore, as we did with their Salt Meat from on Board.</P>
<P>After this Fea&s;t, at which we were very inno|cently merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that there might be no Di&s;pute about
<PB N="135" REF="144">
dividing, I &s;hew'd them that there was &s;ufficient for them all; and de&s;ir'd that they might all take an equal Quantity of the Goods that were for wearing; that is to &s;ay, equal when made up; as fir&s;t, I di&s;tributed Linnen &s;ufficient to make every one of them four Shirts; and at the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Reque&s;t afterwards, made them up &s;ix; the&s;e were exceeding comfortable to them, having been what, as I may &s;ay, they had long &s;ince forgot the U&s;e of or what it was to wear them.</P>
<P>I allotted the thin <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stuffs, which I men|tion'd before, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, which I judged fitte&s;t for the Heat of the Sea&s;on; cool and loo&s;e, and order'd, that when|ever they decayed, they &s;hould make more, as they thought fit: The like for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings and Hats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s what Plea&s;ure, what Sati&s;|faction, &s;at upon the Countenances of all the&s;e poor Men, when they &s;aw the Care I had ta|ken of them, and how well I had furni&s;h'd them; they told me, I was a Father to them, and that having &s;uch a Corre&s;pondent as I was, in &s;o remote a Part of the World, it would make them forget that they were left in a de|&s;olate Place; and they all voluntarily engag'd to me not to leave the Place without my Con|&s;ent.</P>
<P>Then I pre&s;ented to them the People I had brought with me, particularly the Taylor, the Smith, and the two Carpenters, all of them mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary People; but above all, my ge|neral Artificer, than whom they could not
<PB N="136" REF="145">
name any thing that was more u&s;eful to them. And the Taylor, to &s;hew his Concern for them, went to work immediately, and, with my Leave, made them every one a Shirt the fir&s;t Thing he did; and which was &s;till more, he taught the Women, not only how to &s;ow and &s;titch, and u&s;e the Needle, but made them a&s;&s;i&s;t to make the Shirts for their Husbands, and for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the Carpenters, I &s;carce need mention, how u&s;eful they were, for they took in pieces all my clum&s;y unhandy Things, and made them clever convenient Tables, Stools, Bed-&s;teads, Cup-boards, Lockers, Shelves, and every thing they wanted of that Kind.</P>
<P>But to let them &s;ee how Nature made Arti|ficers at fir&s;t, I carried the Carpenters to &s;ee <HI>Will. Atkins</HI>'s Basket-hou&s;e, as I call'd it, and they both own'd they never &s;aw an In&s;tance of &s;uch natural Ingenuity before; nor any thing &s;o regular, and &s;o handily built, at lea&s;t of its Kind: And one of them, when he &s;aw it, after mu&s;ing a good while, turning about to me, I am &s;ure, &s;ays he, that Man has no need of us, you need do nothing but give him Tools.</P>
<P>Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and gave every Man a Digging-Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake, for we had no Harrows or Plows; and to every &s;eparate Place, a Pick-ax, a Crow, a broad Ax, and a Saw; always appointing, that as often as any were broken, or worn out, they &s;hould be &s;upply'd without grudging, out of the general Stores that I left behind.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146">
Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chi&s;&s;els, Knives, Sci&s;&s;ars, and all &s;orts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had without Tale, as they requir'd, for no Man would care to take more than they wanted, and he mu&s;t be a Fool that would wa&s;t or &s;poil them, on any Account whatever; and for the U&s;e of the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought Iron for a Supply.</P>
<P>My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought them, was &s;uch, even to Profu&s;ion, that they could not but rejoice at them, for now they could march as I us'd to do, with a Musket upon each Shoulder, if there was Occa&s;ion, and were able to fight a thou&s;and Savages, if they had but &s;ome little Advantages of Situation, which al&s;o they could not mi&s;s of if they had Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I carry'd on Shore with me the young Man, who&s;e Mother was &s;tarv'd to Death, and the Maid al&s;o; &s;he was a &s;ober well educated reli|gious young Woman, and behav'd &s;o inoffen&s;ive|ly, that every one gave her a good Word; &s;he had indeed an unhappy Life with us, there being no Woman in the Ship but her&s;elf; but &s;he bore it with Patience. After a while &s;eeing Things &s;o well or|der'd, and in &s;o fine a way of thriving upon my I&s;land, and con&s;idering that they had neither Bu&s;i|ne&s;s or Acquaintance in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> or Rea&s;on for taking &s;o long a Voyage: I &s;ay, con&s;idering all this, both of them came to me, and de&s;ir'd I would give them leave to remain on the I&s;land, and be en|ter'd among my Family, as they call'd it.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="147">
I agreed to it readily, and they had a little Plat of Ground allotted to them, where they had three Tents or Hou&s;es &s;et up, &s;urrounded with a Basket-work, Palli&s;ado'd like <HI>Atkins</HI>'s, adjoining to his Plantation: Their Tents were contriv'd, &s;o that they had each of them a Room apart to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Store-hou&s;e to lay all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in; and now the other two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men re|mov'd their Habitation to the &s;ame Place, and &s;o the I&s;land was divided into three Colonies and no more, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with old <HI>Friday,</HI> and the fir&s;t Servants, at my old Habitation under the Hill; which was, in a word, the capital City; and where they had &s;o enlarg'd and extended their Works, as well under as on the out&s;ide of the Hill, that they liv'd, tho' perfectly conceal'd, yet full at large. Never was there &s;uch a little City in a Wood, and &s;o hid, I believe, in any Part of the World; for I verily believe, a thou&s;and Men might have rang'd the I&s;land a Month, and if they had not known there was &s;uch a Thing, and look'd on purpo&s;e for it, they would not have found it; for the Trees &s;tood &s;o thick and &s;o clo&s;e, and grew &s;o fa&s;t matted into one another, that no|thing but cutting them down fir&s;t could di&s;cover the Place; except the only two narrow Entrances, where they went in and out, could be found, which was not very ea&s;y; one of them was ju&s;t down at the Water-Edge of the Creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred Yards to the Place; and the other was up the Ladder at twice, as I have already formerly de&s;crib'd it; and they had a large Wood thick planted, al&s;o, on the Top of the Hill, which contain'd above an
<PB N="139" REF="148">
Acre, which grew apace, and cover'd the Place from all Di&s;covery there, with only one narrow Place between two Trees, not ea&s;y to be di&s;cover'd to enter on that Side.</P>
<P>The other Colony was that of <HI>W. Atkins</HI>'s, where there were four Families of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, I mean tho&s;e I had left there, with their Wives and Children; three Savages that were Slaves; the Widow and Children of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man that was kill'd; the young Man and the Maid; and by the way, we made a Wife of her al&s;o, before we went away: There were al&s;o the two Carpen|ters and the Taylor, who I brought with me for them; al&s;o the Smith, who was a very nece&s;&s;ary Man to them, e&s;pecially as a Gun&s;mith, to take care of their Arms; and my other Man, who I call'd, <HI>Jack of all Trades;</HI> who was in him&s;elf as good, almo&s;t, as 20 Men, for he was not only a very ingenious Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, and before I went away, we married him to the hone&s;t Maid that came with the Youth in the Ship, I mention'd before.</P>
<P>And now I &s;peak of Marrying, it brings me na|turally to &s;ay &s;omething of the <HI>French</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tic that I had brought with me out of the Ship's Crew, who I took up at Sea. It is true, this Man was a <HI>Roman,</HI> and perhaps it may give Offence to &s;ome hereafter, if I leave any Thing extraordinary upon Record, of a Man, who, before I begin, I mu&s;t, (to &s;et him out in ju&s;t Colours) repre&s;ent in Terms very much to his Di&s;advantage, in the Account of Prote&s;tants; as <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that he was a Pa|pi&s;t; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> a popi&s;h Prie&s;t; and <HI>thirdly,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> popi&s;h Prie&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="149">
But Ju&s;tice demands of me to give him a due Character; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, he was a grave, &s;ober, pious, and mo&s;t religious Per&s;on; exact in his Life, exten&s;ive in his Charity, and exemplar in al|mo&s;t every Thing he did; what then can any one &s;ay, again&s;t my being very &s;en&s;ible of the Value of &s;uch a Man, notwith&s;tanding his Profe&s;&s;ion? Tho' it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the Opinion of others, who &s;hall read this, that he was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Hour that I began to conver&s;e with him, after he had agreed to go with me to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> I found Rea&s;on to delight exceedingly in his Conver&s;ation; and he fir&s;t began with me about Religion in the mo&s;t obliging Manner imagi|nable.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays he, you have not only, under God, (and at that he cro&s;s'd his Brea&s;t) &s;av'd my Life, but you have admitted me to go this Voyage in your Ship, and by your obliging Civility have taken me into your Family, giving me an Op|portunity of free Conver&s;ation. Now Sir, &s;ays he, you &s;ee by my Habit what my Profe&s;&s;ion is, and I gue&s;s by your Nation what yours is: I may think it is my Duty, and doubtle&s;s it is &s;o, to u&s;e my utmo&s;t Endeavours, on all Occa&s;ions, to bring all the Souls I can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to embrace the Catholick Doctrine; but as I am here under your Permi&s;&s;ion, and in your Family, I am bound in Ju&s;tice to your Kind|ne&s;s, as well as in Decency and good Manners, to be under your Government; and therefore I &s;hall not, without your Leave, enter into any Debates
<PB N="141" REF="150">
on the Point of Religion, in which we may not agree, farther than you &s;hall give me Leave.</P>
<P>I told him, his Carriage was &s;o mode&s;t, that I could not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were &s;uch People as they call'd Hereticks; but that he was not the fir&s;t Catholick that I had con|vers'd with, without falling into any Inconvenien|cies, or carrying the Que&s;tions to any height in Debate: That he &s;hould not find him&s;elf the wor&s;e us'd for being of a different Opinion from us, and if we did not conver&s;e without any Di&s;like on ei|ther Side upon that Score, it &s;hould be his Fault, not ours.</P>
<P>He reply'd, that he thought all our Conver&s;a|tion might be ea&s;ily &s;eparated from Di&s;putes: That it was not his Bu&s;ine&s;s to cap Principles with every Man he di&s;cours'd with; and that he rather de&s;ir'd me to conver&s;e with him as a Gen|tleman, than as a Religieu&s;e; that if I would give him leave at any time to di&s;cour&s;e upon reli|gious Subjects, he would readily comply with it; and that then, he did not doubt but I would allow him al&s;o to defend his own Opinions, as well as he could; but that without my Leave he would not break in upon me with any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>He told me farther, that he would not cea&s;e to do all that became him in his Office, as a Prie&s;t, as well as a private Chri&s;tian, to procure the Good of the Ship, and the Safety of all that was in her; and tho' perhaps we would not join with him, and he could not pray <HI>with</HI> us, he hop'd he might pray <HI>for</HI> us, which he would
<PB N="142" REF="151">
do upon all Occa&s;ions. In this Manner we con|vers'd, and as he was of a mo&s;t obliging Gentle|man-like Behaviour; &s;o he was, if I may be al|low'd to &s;ay &s;o, a Man of good Sen&s;e, and as I believe, of great Learning.</P>
<P>He gave me a mo&s;t diverting Account of his Life, and of the many extraordinary Events of it; of many Adventures which had befallen him in the few Years that he had been abroad in the World, and particularly this was very remarkable, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That in the Voyage he was now engag'd, he had had the Misfortune to be five times &s;hip'd and un&s;hip'd, and never to go to the Place whither any of the Ships, he was in, were at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd: That his fir&s;t Intent was to have gone to <HI>Martinico,</HI> and that he went on board a Ship bound thither, at St. <HI>Malo;</HI> but being forc'd into <HI>Lisbon</HI> by bad Weather, the Ship receiv'd &s;ome Damage, by running a-ground in the Mouth of the River <HI>Tagus,</HI> and was oblig'd to unload her Cargo there; that finding a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship there bound to the <HI>Maderas,</HI> and ready to &s;ail, and &s;up|po&s;ing he &s;hould ea&s;ily meet with a Ve&s;&s;el there bound to <HI>Martinico;</HI> he went on board, in order to &s;ail to the <HI>Maderas;</HI> but the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> Ship being but an indifferent Mariner, had been out in his Reckoning, and they drove to <HI>Fial;</HI> where, however, he happen'd to find a very good Market for his Cargo, which was Corn, and therefore re&s;olv'd not to go to the <HI>Maderas,</HI> but to load Salt at the <HI>I&s;le of May,</HI> and to go away to <HI>Newfoundland:</HI> He had no Remedy in this Exi|gence, but to go with the Ship, and had a pretty good Voyage as far as the <HI>Banks,</HI> &s;o they call the Place where they catch the Fi&s;h, where meeting with a <HI>French</HI> Ship, bound from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Quebeck</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="152">
in the River of <HI>Canada,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Mar|tinico,</HI> to carry Provi&s;ions, he thought he &s;hould have an Opportunity to compleat his fir&s;t De|&s;ign: But when he came to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Ship dy'd, and the Ship proceeded no farther; &s;o the next Voyage he &s;hip'd him&s;elf for <HI>France,</HI> in the Ship that was burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then &s;hip'd with us for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> as I have already &s;aid: Thus he had been di&s;appointed in five Voyages, all, <HI>as I may call it,</HI> in one Voyage, be&s;ides what I &s;hall have Occa|&s;ion to mention farther of the &s;ame Per&s;on.</P>
<P>But, I &s;hall not make Digre&s;&s;ions into other Men's Stories, which have no Relation to my own. I return to what concerns our Affair in the I&s;land: He came to me one Morning, for he lodg'd among us all the while we were upon the I&s;land; and it happen'd to be ju&s;t when I was go|ing to vi&s;it the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men's Colony, at the far|the&s;t Part of the I&s;land, I &s;ay, he came to me and told me, with a very grave Countenance, that he had for two or three Days de&s;ir'd an Opportunity of &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with me, which he hop'd &s;hould not be di&s;plea&s;ing to me, becau&s;e he thought it might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure corre&s;pond with my gene|ral De&s;ign, which was the Pro&s;perity of my new Colony, and perhaps might put it, at lea&s;t more than he yet thought it was, in the Way of God's Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I look'd a little &s;urpriz'd at the la&s;t Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e, and turning a little &s;hort, <HI>How Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>can it be &s;aid,</HI> that we are not in the Way of God's Ble&s;&s;ing, after &s;uch <HI>vi&s;ible A&s;&s;i&s;tances</HI> and <HI>won|derful Deliverances</HI> as we have &s;een here, <HI>and of which I have given you a large Account?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="153">
If you had pleas'd, <HI>Sir, &s;aid he with a world of Mode&s;ty, and yet with great Readine&s;s,</HI> to have heard me, you would have found no room to have been di&s;pleas'd, much le&s;s to think &s;o hard of me, that I &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t, that you have not had wonderful A&s;&s;i&s;tances and Deliverances; and I hope, on your Behalf, that you are in the Way of God's Ble&s;&s;ing, and your De&s;ign is exceeding good, and will pro&s;|per: But, Sir, tho' it were more &s;o, than is even po&s;&s;ible to you, yet there may be &s;ome among you that are not equally right in their Actions: And you know, that in the Story of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> one <HI>Achan</HI> in the Camp remov'd God's Ble&s;&s;ing from them, and turn'd his Hand &s;o again&s;t them, that &s;ix and thirty of them, tho' not concern'd in the Crime, were the Object of Divine Vengeance, and bore the Weight of that Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I was &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with his Di&s;cour&s;e, and told him, his Inference was &s;o ju&s;t, and the whole De&s;ign &s;eem'd &s;o &s;incere, and was really &s;o religious in its own Nature, that I was very &s;orry I had in|terrupted him, and beg'd him to go on; and in the mean Time, becau&s;e it &s;eem'd, that what we had both to &s;ay might take up &s;ome Time, I told him, I was going to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mens Plantations, and ask'd him to go with me, and we might di&s;cour&s;e of it by the Way: He told me, he would more willingly wait on me thither, becau&s;e there part|ly the Thing was acted, which he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak to me about, &s;o we walk'd on; and I pre&s;s'd him to be free and plain with me, in what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="154">
Why then, Sir, &s;ays he, be plea&s;ed to give me Leave to lay down a few Propo&s;itions, as the Foundation of what I have to &s;ay, that we may not differ in the general Principles, tho' we may be of &s;ome differing Opinions in the Practice of Particulars. Fir&s;t, Sir, tho' we differ in &s;ome of the doctrinal Articles of Religion; and it is very unhappy that it is &s;o, e&s;pecially in the Ca&s;e be|fore us, as I &s;hall &s;hew afterwards: Yet there are &s;ome general Principles in which we both agree, <HI>(viz).</HI> fir&s;t, That there is a God; and that this God having given us &s;ome &s;tated general Rules for our Service and Obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him; either by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by doing what he has expre&s;ly forbidden: And let our different Religions be what they will, this general Principle is readily own'd by us all, That the Ble&s;&s;ing of God does not ordinarily follow a pre&s;umptuous &s;inning again&s;t his Command; and every good Chri&s;tian will be affectionately concern'd to pre|vent any that are under his Care, living in a total Neglect of God and his Commands. It is not your Men being Prote&s;tants, whatever my Opinion may be of &s;uch, that di&s;charges me from being concern'd for their Souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that they &s;hould live in as little Di&s;tance from and Enmity with their Maker, as po&s;&s;ible, e&s;|pecially if you give me Leave to meddle &s;o far in your Circuit.</P>
<P>I could not yet imagine what he aim'd at, and told him, I granted all he had &s;aid, and thank'd him, that he would &s;o far concern him&s;elf for us; and beg'd he would explain the Particulars of what he had ob&s;erv'd, that, like <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> to take
<PB N="146" REF="155">
his own Parable, I might put away the accur&s;ed Thing from us.</P>
<P>Why then, Sir, &s;ays he, I will take the Liber|ty you give me; and there are three Things, which, if I am right, mu&s;t &s;tand in the Way of God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon your Endeavours here, and which I &s;hould rejoice for your &s;ake, and their own, to &s;ee remov'd. And, Sir, &s;ays he, I pro|mi&s;e my&s;elf, that you will fully agree with me in them all, as &s;oon as I name them; e&s;pecially be|cau&s;e I &s;hall convince you, that every one of them may, with great Ea&s;e, and very much to your Sa|tisfaction, be remedy'd.</P>
<P>He gave me no Leave to put in any more Ci|vilities, but went on. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Sir, &s;ays he, you have here four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who have fetch'd Wo|men from among the Savages, and have taken them as their Wives, and have had many Chil|dren by them all, and yet are not marry'd to them after any &s;tated legal Manner, as the Laws of God and Man require; and therefore are yet, in the Sen&s;e of both, no le&s;s than <HI>Adulterers,</HI> and li|ving in Adultery. To this, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I know you will object, That there was no Clergyman or Prie&s;t of any Kind, or of any Profe&s;&s;ion, to perform the Ceremony; nor any Pen and Ink, or Paper, to write down a Contract of Marriage, and have it &s;ign'd between them. And I know al&s;o, Sir, what the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governour has told you; I mean of the Agreement that he oblig'd them to make, when they took the&s;e Women <HI>(viz.)</HI> That they &s;hould chu&s;e them out by Con&s;ent, and keep &s;eparately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the
<PB N="147" REF="156">
Women, as Wives, but only an Agreement among them&s;elves, to keep them from quarrelling.</P>
<P>But, Sir, the E&s;&s;ence of the Sacrament of Ma|trimony (&s;o he call'd it, being a <HI>Roman</HI>) con&s;i&s;ts not only in the mutual Con&s;ent of the Parties to take one another, <HI>as Man and Wife,</HI> but in the formal and legal Obligation, that there is in the Contract, to compel the Man and Woman at all Times, to own and acknowledge each other, obli|ging the Men to ab&s;tain from all other Women, to engage in no other Contract while the&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and on all Occa&s;ions, as Ability allows, to pro|vide hone&s;tly for them and their Children, and to oblige the Woman to the &s;ame, or like Conditions, <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> on their Side.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the&s;e Men may, when they plea&s;e, or when Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents, abandon the&s;e Women, di&s;own their Children, leave them to pe|ri&s;h, and take other Women, and marry them whil&s;t the&s;e are living. And here he added, with &s;ome Warmth, How, Sir, is God honour'd in this unlawful Liberty? And how &s;hall a Ble&s;&s;ing &s;uc|ceed your Endeavours in this Place? <HI>However good in them&s;elves,</HI> and <HI>however &s;incere in your De&s;ign,</HI> while the&s;e Men, who at pre&s;ent are your Sub|jects, under your ab&s;olute Government and Do|minion, are allow'd by you to live in open A|dultery?</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I was &s;truck at the Thing it&s;elf, but much more with the convincing Arguments he &s;upported it with; for it was certainly true, that tho' they had no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal Contract on both Sides, made before Wit|ne&s;&s;es, and confirm'd by any Token, which they had
<PB N="148" REF="157">
all agreed to be bound by, tho' it had been but breaking a Stick between them, engaging the Men to own the&s;e Women for their Wives, upon all Occa&s;ions, and never to abandon them or their Children, and the Women to the &s;ame with their Husbands, had been an effectual lawful Marriage in the Sight of God; and it was a great Neglect that it was not done.</P>
<P>But I thought to have gotten off with my young Prie&s;t, by telling him, that all that Part was done when I was not here, and they had liv'd &s;o many Years with them now, that if it was an Adultery, it was pa&s;t Remedy, they could do nothing in it now.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>&s;ays he, asking your Pardon for &s;uch Freedom,</HI> you are right in this, that it being done in your Ab&s;ence, you could not be charg'd with that Part of the Crime: But I be&s;eech you, flatter not your|&s;elf, that you are not therefore under an Obliga|tion to do your utmo&s;t now to put an End to it. How can you think, but that, let the Time pa&s;t lie on who it will, all the Guilt, for the future, will lie entirely upon you? Becau&s;e it is certainly in your Power now to put an End to it, and in no Body's Power but yours.</P>
<P>I was &s;o dull &s;till, that I did not take him right; but I imagin'd, that by putting an End to it, he meant that I &s;hould part them, and not &s;uffer them to live together any longer; <HI>And I &s;aid to him,</HI> I could not do that by any Means, for that it would put the whole I&s;land into Confu&s;ion: He &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd, that I &s;hould &s;o far mi&s;take him. No, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I do not mean, that you &s;hould now &s;eparate them, but legally and effectually mar|ry
<PB N="149" REF="158">
them now; and as, Sir, my Way of marrying them may not be &s;o ea&s;y to reconcile them to, tho' it will be as effectual, even by your own Laws, &s;o your Way may be as well before God, and as valid among Men; I mean, by a written Contract, &s;ign'd by both Man and Woman, and by all the Witne&s;&s;es pre&s;ent, which all the Laws of <HI>Europe</HI> would decree to be valid.</P>
<P>I was amaz'd to &s;ee &s;o much true Piety, and &s;o much Sincerity of Zeal, be&s;ides the unu&s;ual Impar|tiality in his Di&s;cour&s;e, as to his own Party or Church, and &s;uch true Warmth for the pre&s;erving People that he had no Knowledge of, or Relation to; I &s;ay, for pre&s;erving them from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Laws of God; the like of which I had in|deed not met with any where: But recollecting what he had &s;aid, of marrying them by a written Contract, which I knew would &s;tand too; I re|turn'd it back upon him, and told him, I granted all that he had &s;aid to be ju&s;t, and on his Part very kind, that I would di&s;cour&s;e with the Men upon the Point now, when I came to them: And I knew no Rea&s;on why they &s;hou'd &s;cruple to let him marry them all, which I knew well enough would be granted to be as authentick and valid in <HI>England,</HI> as if they were marry'd by one of our own Clergymen. What was afterwards done in this matter, I &s;hall &s;peak of by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I then pre&s;s'd him to tell me what was the <HI>&s;econd Complaint</HI> which he had to make, acknowledging, that I was very much his Debtor for the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and thank'd him heartily for it. He told me, he would u&s;e the &s;ame Freedom and Plainne&s;s in the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> and hop'd I would take it as well: And this was, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects of
<PB N="150" REF="159">
mine, <HI>as he call'd them,</HI> had lived with tho&s;e Wo|men for almo&s;t &s;even Years, had taught them to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and even to read it; and that they were, as he perceiv'd, Women of tolerable Under|&s;tanding, and capable of In&s;truction; yet they had not to this Hour taught them any thing of the Chri&s;tian Religion, no, not &s;o much as to know that there was a God, or a Wor&s;hip, or in what Man|ner God was to be &s;erved, or that their own Ido|latry, and wor&s;hipping they knew not who, was fal&s;e and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>This, he &s;aid, was an unaccountable Neglect, and what God would certainly call them to Ac|count for, and perhaps at la&s;t take the Work out of their Hands. He &s;poke this very affectionately and warmly. I am per&s;waded, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> had tho&s;e Men lived in the &s;avage Country, whence their Wives came; the Savages would have taken more Pains to have brought them to be Idolaters, and to wor&s;hip the Devil, than any of the&s;e Men, <HI>&s;o far as he could &s;ee,</HI> had taken with them to teach them the Knowledge of the true God. Now, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> tho' I do not acknowledge your Religion, or you mine, yet we &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the De|vil's Servants, and the Subjects of his Kingdom, taught to know the general Principles of the Chri&s;|tian Religion; that they might, at lea&s;t, hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the Re&s;urrec|tion, and of a future State, Things which we all believe; they had at lea&s;t been &s;o much nearer coming into the Bo&s;om of the true Church, than they are now in the publick Profe&s;&s;ion of Idolatry and Devil-Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>I could hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, and embrac'd him with an Exce&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion: <HI>How</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="160">
<HI>far,</HI> &s;aid I to him, have I been from under&s;tand|ing the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part of a Chri&s;tian! <HI>(viz.)</HI> to love the Intere&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Church, and the good of other Mens Souls. I &s;carce have known what belongs to being a Chri&s;tian. O, Sir, do not &s;ay &s;o, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> this Thing is not your Fault. No, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as you? 'Tis not too late yet, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> be not too forward to condemn your&s;elf: But what can be done now, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you &s;ee I am going away? Will you give me Leave, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to talk with tho&s;e poor Men about it? Yes, with all my Heart, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and will oblige them to give heed to what you &s;ay too: As to that, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we mu&s;t leave them to the Mercy of Chri&s;t; but 'tis our Bu&s;ine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, encourage them, and in&s;truct them; and if you will give me Leave, and God his Ble&s;&s;ing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant Souls &s;hall be brought home into the great Circle of Chri&s;tianity, if not into the parti|cular Faith that we all embrace, and that even while you &s;tay here: Upon this, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I &s;hall not only give you Leave, but give you a thou&s;and Thanks for it. What follow'd on this Account, I &s;hall mention al&s;o again in its Place.</P>
<P>I now pre&s;s'd him for the <HI>third</HI> Article, in which we were to blame. Why really, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it is of the &s;ame Nature, and I will proceed, <HI>asking your Leave,</HI> with the &s;ame Plainne&s;s as before; it is about your poor Savages, who are, as I may &s;ay, your conquer'd Subjects. It is a Maxim, Sir, that is or ought to be receiv'd among all Chri&s;tians of what Church or pretended Church &s;oever, <HI>(viz.) The Chri&s;tian Knowledge ought to be propagated by all po&s;&s;ible Means, and on all po&s;&s;ible Occa&s;ions:</HI> 'Tis on this Principle that our Church &s;ends Mi&s;&s;ionaries
<PB N="152" REF="161">
into <HI>Per&s;ia, India,</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and that our Clergy, even of the &s;uperior Sort, willingly engage in the mo&s;t hazardous Voyages, and the mo&s;t dangerous Re&s;idence among Murderers and Barbarians, to teach them the Knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to embrace the Chri&s;tian Faith. Now, Sir, you have &s;uch an Opportunity here, to have &s;ix or &s;even and thirty poor Savages brought over from Idolatry to the Knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pa&s;s &s;uch an Occa&s;ion of doing Good, which is really worth the Expence of a Man's whole Life.</P>
<P>I was now &s;truck dumb indeed, and had not one Word to &s;ay. I had here a Spirit of true Chri&s;tian Zeal for God and Religion before me, let his particular Principles be of what kind &s;o|ever; as for me, I had not &s;o much as entertain'd a Thought of this in my Heart before, and I be|lieve &s;hould not have thought of it; for I look'd upon the&s;e Savages as Slaves, and People, who, had we had any Work for them to do, we would ha' u&s;ed as &s;uch, or would ha' been glad to have tran&s;ported them to any other Part of the World; for our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to get rid of them, and we would all have been &s;atisfy'd, if they had been &s;ent to any Country, &s;o they had never &s;een their own: <HI>But to the Ca&s;e,</HI> I &s;ay, I was confounded at his Di&s;cour&s;e, and knew not what An&s;wer to make him. He look'd earne&s;tly at me, &s;eeing me in &s;ome Di&s;order; Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I &s;hall be very &s;orry, if what I have &s;aid gives you any Offence: No, No, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I am offended with no Body but my|&s;elf; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I &s;hould never take any Notice of this before, but with reflecting what Notice I am able
<PB N="153" REF="162">
to take of it now. You know, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> what Circum&s;tances I am in, I am bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to whom it would be an un&s;ufferable Piece of Inju&s;tice to detain their Ship here, the Men lying all this while at Victuals and Wages upon the Owners Account. It is true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days here, and if I &s;tay more, I mu&s;t pay 3 <HI>l. Sterling per Diem</HI> Demorage, nor can I &s;tay up|on Demorage above eight Days more, and I have been here thirteen Days already, &s;o that I am per|fectly unable to engage in this Work, unle&s;s I would &s;uffer my&s;elf to be left behind here again, in which Ca&s;e, if this &s;ingle Ship &s;hould mi&s;carry in any Part of her Voyage, I &s;hould be ju&s;t in the &s;ame Condition that I was left in here at fir&s;t, and from which I have been &s;o wonderfully delivered.</P>
<P>He own'd the Ca&s;e was very hard upon me, as to my Voyage; but laid it home upon my Con|&s;cience, whether the Ble&s;&s;ing of &s;aving &s;even and thirty Souls, was not worth my venturing all I had in the World for? I was not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of that <HI>as he was.</HI> I return'd upon him thus, why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing, indeed, to be an In&s;trument in God's Hand to convert &s;even and thirty Hea|thens to the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, but as you are an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and are given over to the Work, &s;o that it &s;eems &s;o naturally to fall into the Way of your Profe&s;&s;ion; how is it, that you do not rather offer your&s;elf to undertake it, than pre&s;s me to it?</P>
<P>Upon this he fac'd about, ju&s;t before me, as we walk'd along, and putting me to a full Stop, made me a very low Bow; I mo&s;t heartily thank
<PB N="154" REF="163">
God and you, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for giving me &s;o evi|dent a Call to &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a Work; and if you think your &s;elf di&s;charg'd from it, and de&s;ire me to un|dertake it, I will mo&s;t readily do it, and think it a happy Reward for all the Hazards and Difficulties of &s;uch a broken di&s;appointed Voyage as I have met with, that I may be dropt at la&s;t into &s;o glo|rious a Work.</P>
<P>I di&s;cover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while he &s;poke this to me; his Eyes &s;parkl'd like Fire, his Face glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if he had been falling into Fits; in a Word, he was fir'd with the Joy of being embark'd in &s;uch a Work. I paus'd a con&s;iderable while before I could tell what to &s;ay to him, for I was really &s;urpriz'd to find a Man of &s;uch Sincerity and Zeal, and carry'd out in his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of Men, not of his Profe&s;&s;ion only, but even of any Profe&s;|&s;ion what&s;oever. But after I had con&s;ider'd it a|while, I ask'd him &s;eriou&s;ly if he was in earne&s;t, and that he would venture on the &s;ingle Con&s;idera|tion of an Attempt on tho&s;e poor People, to be lock'd up in an unplanted I&s;land for, perhaps, his Life, and at la&s;t might not know whether he &s;hould be able to do them any Good, or not?</P>
<P>He turn'd &s;hort upon me, and ask'd me what I call'd a Venture? Pray, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> what do you think I con&s;ented to go in your Ship to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> for? Nay, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that I know not, unle&s;s it was to preach to the <HI>Indians:</HI> Doubt|le&s;s it was, &s;aid he; and do you think, if I can convert the&s;e &s;even and thirty Men to the Faith of Chri&s;t, it is not worth my time, tho' I &s;hould never be fetch'd off the I&s;land again?
<PB N="155" REF="164">
nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to &s;ave &s;o many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twen|ty more of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion? Yes, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I would give Chri&s;t and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin Thanks all my Days, if I could be made the lea&s;t happy In&s;trument of &s;aving the Souls of the&s;e poor Men, tho' I was never to &s;et my Foot off of this I&s;land, or &s;ee my native Country any more. But &s;ince you will honour me, &s;ays he, with putting me into this Work, <HI>for which I will pray for you all the Days of my Life;</HI> I have one humble Petition to you, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> be&s;ides. What is that, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI> Why, &s;ays he, it is, that you will leave your Man <HI>Friday</HI> with me, to be my Interpreter to them, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; for without &s;ome Help I cannot &s;peak to them, or they to me.</P>
<P>I was &s;en&s;ibly troubled at his reque&s;ting <HI>Friday,</HI> becau&s;e I could not think of parting with him, and that for many Rea&s;ons; he had been the Compa|nion of my Travels; he was not only faithful to me, but &s;incerely affectionate to the la&s;t Degree, and I had re&s;olv'd to do &s;omething con&s;iderable for him, if he out-liv'd me, as it was probable he would. Then I knew that, as I had bred <HI>Friday</HI> up to be a Prote&s;tant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another Profe&s;&s;ion; and he would never, while his Eyes were open, believe that his old Ma&s;ter was a Heretick and would be damn'd; and this might in the End ruin the poor Fellow's Principles, and &s;o turn him to his fir&s;t Idolatry.</P>
<P>However, a &s;udden Thought reliev'd me in this Strait, and it was this; I told him, I could not &s;ay that I was willing to part with <HI>Friday</HI> on any Account whatever, tho' a Work that to him was
<PB N="156" REF="165">
of more Value than his Life, ought to be to me of much le&s;s Value than the keeping or parting with a Servant; But on the other hand, I was per|&s;uaded that <HI>Friday</HI> would by no Means con&s;ent to part with me, and I could not force him to it with|out his Con&s;ent, without manife&s;t Inju&s;tice, becau&s;e I had promi&s;ed I would never put him away, and he had promis'd and engag'd to me that he would never leave me, unle&s;s I put him away.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd very much concern'd at it, for he had no rational Acce&s;s to the&s;e poor People, &s;eeing he did not under&s;tand one Word of their Language, nor they one Word of his: To remove this Diffi|culty, I told him, <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father had learn'd <HI>Spa|ni&s;h,</HI> which I found he al&s;o under&s;tood, and he &s;hould &s;erve him for an Interpreter; &s;o he was much bet|ter &s;atisfied, and nothing could per&s;uade him but he would &s;tay to endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave another, and very happy, Turn to all this.</P>
<P>I come back now to the fir&s;t Part of his Objections. When we came to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, I &s;ent for them all together, and after &s;ome Ac|count given them of what I had done for them, <HI>viz.</HI> what nece&s;&s;ary Things I had provided for them, and how they were di&s;tributed, which they were very &s;en&s;ible of, and very thankful for; I began to talk to them of the &s;candalous Life they led, and gave them a full Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already taken of it, and arguing how unchri&s;tian and irreligious a Life it was. I fir&s;t ask'd them if they were mar|ried Men or Batchelors? They &s;oon explain'd their Condition to me, and &s;hew'd me that two
<PB N="157" REF="166">
of them were Widowers, and the other three were &s;ingle Men or Batchelors. I ask'd them with what Con&s;ciences they could take the&s;e Women and lie with them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and have &s;o many Children by them, and not be marry'd lawfully to them.</P>
<P>They all gave me the An&s;wer that I expected, <HI>viz.</HI> that there was no Body to marry them; that they agreed before the Governor to keep them as their Wives; and to keep them and own them as their Wives; and they thought as Things &s;tood with them, they were as legally married as if they had been married by a Par&s;on, and with all the Formalities in the World.</P>
<P>I told them, that no doubt they were married in the Sight of God, and were bound in Con&s;ci|ence to keep them as their Wives, but that the Laws of Men being otherwi&s;e, they might pre|tend they were not married, and &s;o de&s;ert the poor Women and Children hereafter; and that their Wives being poor de&s;olate Women, friendle&s;s and moneyle&s;s, would have no way to help them&s;elves. I therefore told them, that unle&s;s I was a&s;&s;ur'd of their hone&s;t Intent, I could do nothing for them; but would take Care that what I did &s;hould be for the Women and their Children without them, and that unle&s;s they would give &s;ome A&s;&s;urances that they would marry the Women, I could not think it was convenient they &s;hould continue together as Man and Wife, for that it was both &s;candalous to Men, and offen&s;ive to God, who they could not think would ble&s;s them, if they went on thus.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="167">
All this went on as I expected, and they told me, e&s;pecially <HI>Will Atkins,</HI> who &s;eem'd now to &s;peak for the re&s;t, that they lov'd their Wives as well, as if they had been born in their own Na|tive Country, and would not leave them upon any Account whatever; and they did very believe their Wives were as virtuous and as mode&s;t, and did, to the utmo&s;t of their Skill, as much for them, and for their Children, as any Women could po&s;&s;ibly do, and they would not part with them on any Account: And <HI>Will Atkins</HI> for his own particular added, if any Man would take him away, and offer to carry him home to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and make him Captain of the be&s;t Man of War in the Navy, he would not go with him, if he might not carry his Wife and Children with him; and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he would be married to her now with all his Heart.</P>
<P>This was ju&s;t as I would have it; the Prie&s;t was not with me at that Moment, but was not far off: So to try him farther, I told him I had a Clergyman with me, and if he was &s;incere, I would have him married the next Morning, and bid him con&s;ider of it, and talk with the re&s;t; he &s;aid, as for him&s;elf, he need not con&s;ider of it at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a Mini&s;ter with me, and he believ'd they would be all willing al&s;o. I then told him that my Friend the Mini&s;ter was a <HI>French Man,</HI> and could not &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but that I would act the Clerk between them: He never &s;o much as ask'd me whether he was Papi&s;t or Prote&s;tant, which was indeed what I was afraid of: But, I &s;ay, they never enquir'd about it. So we part|ed,
<PB N="159" REF="168">
I went back to my Clergyman, and <HI>Will At|kins</HI> went in to talk with his Companions. I de|&s;ir'd the <HI>French</HI> Gentleman not to &s;ay any thing to them, till the Bu&s;ine&s;s was thorough ripe, and I told him what An&s;wer the Men had given me.</P>
<P>Before I went from their Quarter, they all came to me, and told me, they had been con&s;idering what I had &s;aid, that they were very glad to hear I had a Clergyman in my Company, and they were very willing to give me the Satisfaction I de|&s;ir'd, and to be formally Married as &s;oon as I pleas'd, for they were far from de&s;iring to part with their Wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very hone&s;t when they cho&s;e them; &s;o I appointed them to meet me the next Morning, and that in the mean time they &s;hould let their Wives know the meaning of the Marriage-Law; and that it was not only to prevent any Scandal, but al&s;o to oblige them, that they &s;hould not for&s;ake them, whatever might happen.</P>
<P>The Women were ea&s;ily made &s;en&s;ible of the Meaning of the Thing, and were very well &s;atis|fied with it, as, indeed, they had Rea&s;on to be; &s;o they fail'd not to attend all together at my Apart|ment the next Morning, where I brought out my Clergyman; and tho' he had not on a Mini&s;ter's Gown, after the Manner of <HI>England,</HI> or the Ha|bit of a Prie&s;t, after the Manner of <HI>France;</HI> yet having a black Ve&s;t &s;omething like a Ca&s;&s;ock, with a Sa&s;h round it, he did not look very unlike a Mi|ni&s;ter; and as for his Language, I was his Inter|preter.</P>
<P>But the Seriou&s;ne&s;s of his Behaviour to them, and the Scruples he made of marrying the Wo|men,
<PB N="160" REF="169">
becau&s;e they were not baptiz'd, and pro|fe&s;s'd <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> gave them an exceeding Reve|rence for his Per&s;on; and there was no need after that, to enquire whether he was a Clergyman or no.</P>
<P>Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have been carry'd &s;o far, as that he would not have marry'd them at all; nay, notwith&s;tanding all I was able to &s;ay to him, he re&s;i&s;ted me, though mode&s;tly, yet very &s;teadily, and at la&s;t refu&s;ed ab|&s;olutely to marry them, unle&s;s he had fir&s;t talk'd with the Men, and the Women too; and though at fir&s;t I was a little backward to it, yet at la&s;t I agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving the Sin|cerity of his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>When he came to them, he let them know, that I had acquainted him with their Circum|&s;tances, and with the pre&s;ent De&s;ign: That he was very willing to perform that Part of his Func|tion, and marry them as I had de&s;ir'd; but that before he could do it, he mu&s;t take the Liberty to talk with them. He told them, That in the Sight of all indifferent Men, and in the Sen&s;e of the Laws of Society, they had liv'd all this while in an open Adultery; and that it was true, that nothing but the Con&s;enting to marry, or ef|fectually &s;eparating them from one another now, could put an End to it; but there was a Difficul|ty in it too, with re&s;pect to the Laws of <HI>Chri&s;|tian</HI> Matrimony, which he was not fully &s;atisfy'd about, <HI>viz.</HI> That of marrying one that is a pro|fe&s;s'd <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> to a Savage, an Idolater, and a Heathen, one that is not baptiz'd; and yet that he did not &s;ee that there was Time left for it to endeavour to per&s;uade the Women to be bap|tiz'd,
<PB N="161" REF="170">
or to profe&s;s the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they could not be baptiz'd.</P>
<P>He told them, He doubted they were but in|different Chri&s;tians them&s;elves; that they had but little Knowledge of God, or of his Ways; and therefore he could not expect that they had &s;aid much to their Wives on that Head yet; but that unle&s;s they would promi&s;e him to u&s;e their Endea|vour with their Wives, to per&s;uade them to become Chri&s;tians, and would as well as they could in&s;truct them in the Knowledge and Belief of God that made them, and to wor&s;hip Je&s;us Chri&s;t that re|deem'd them, he could not marry them; for he would have no Hand in joyning Chri&s;tians with Savages; nor was it con&s;i&s;tent with the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and was indeed expre&s;|ly forbidden in God's Law.</P>
<P>They heard all this very attentively, and I de|liver'd it very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as near his own Words as I could, only &s;ome|times adding &s;omething of my own to convince them how ju&s;t it was, and how I was of his Mind; and I always very faithfully di&s;tingui&s;h'd between what I &s;aid from my&s;elf, and what were the Clergyman's Words. They told me, it was very true, what the Gentleman had &s;aid, that they were but very indifferent <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> them|&s;elves, and that they had never talk'd to their Wives about Religion. <HI>Lord, Sir!</HI> &s;ays <HI>Will. At|kins,</HI> How &s;hould we teach them Religion? Why we know nothing our&s;elves; and be&s;ides, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;hould we go to talk to them of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> 'twould be to make them laugh at us, and ask us, What we
<PB N="162" REF="171">
believe our&s;elves? And if we &s;hould tell them we believe all the Things that we &s;peak of to them, &s;uch as of good People going to <HI>Heaven,</HI> and wicked People to the <HI>Devil,</HI> they would ask us, Where we intend to go our&s;elves, that be|lieve all this, and are &s;uch wicked Fellows, as we indeed are? Why, Sir, 'tis enough to give them a Surfeit of Religion at fir&s;t Hea|ring: Folks mu&s;t have &s;ome Religion them&s;elves, before they pretend to teach other People: <HI>Will Atkins, &s;aid I to him;</HI> though I am afraid what you &s;ay has too much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your Wife that &s;he's in the wrong? That there is a God and a Religion better than her own; that her Gods are Idols, that they can nei|ther hear nor &s;peak; that there is a great Being that made all Things, and that can de&s;troy all that he had made; that he rewards the Good, and puni&s;hes the Bad; and that we are to be judg'd by him at la&s;t for all we do here: You are not &s;o ignorant, but even Nature it&s;elf will teach you that all this is true, and I am &s;atisfy'd you know it all to be true, and believe it your|&s;elf.</P>
<P>That's true, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Atkins;</HI> but with what Face can I &s;ay any thing to my Wife of all this, when &s;he will tell me immediately it cannot be true?</P>
<P>Not true, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> What do you mean by that? Why, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> She will tell me it cannot be true, that this God I &s;hall tell her of can be ju&s;t, or can puni&s;h, or reward, &s;ince I am not puni&s;h'd, and &s;ent to the Devil, that have been &s;uch a wicked Creature as &s;he knows I have been, even to her, and to every Body el&s;e; and that I &s;hould
<PB N="163" REF="172">
be &s;uffer'd to live, that have been always acting &s;o contrary to what I mu&s;t tell her is Good, and to what I ought to have done.</P>
<P>Why, truly, <HI>Atkins, &s;aid I,</HI> I am afraid thou &s;peak'&s;t too much Truth; and with that I let the Clergyman know what <HI>Atkins</HI> had &s;aid, for he was impatient to know: <HI>O! &s;aid the Prie&s;t;</HI> tell him there is one Thing will make him the be&s;t Mini&s;ter in the World to his Wife, and that is, <HI>Repentance;</HI> for none teach Repentance like true Penitents: He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be &s;o much the better qualify'd to in&s;truct his Wife: He will be then able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and that he is the ju&s;t Rewarder of Good and Evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and with infinite Goodne&s;s and Long-&s;uffering for|bears to puni&s;h tho&s;e that offend, waiting to be gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he &s;hould return and live; that oftentimes &s;uffers wicked Men to go on a long Time, and even re&s;erves Damnation to the gene|ral Day of Retribution; that it is a clear Evi|dence of God, and of a future State, that righteous Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men their Puni&s;hment, 'till they come into another World; and this will lead him to teach his Wife the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection, and of the la&s;t Judgment; let him but repent for him&s;elf, he will be an excellent Preacher of Repentance to his Wife.</P>
<P>I repeated all this to <HI>Atkins,</HI> who look'd very &s;erious all the while, and who, we could ea&s;ily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it: When being eager, and hardly &s;uffering me to make an End, <HI>I know all this, Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and a great</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="173">
<HI>deal more;</HI> but I han't the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife, when God, and my own Con&s;cience knows, and my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> will be an undeniable Evi|dence again&s;t me, that I have liv'd, as if I had never heard of a God, or future State, or any Thing about it; and to talk of my repenting, ALAS! <HI>And with that he fetch'd a deep Sigh;</HI> and I could &s;ee, that Tears &s;tood in his Eyes; 'Tis pa&s;t all that with me. Pa&s;t it! ATKINS, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> What do'&s;t thou mean by that? I know well enough what I mean, &s;ays he, <HI>I mean 'tis too late,</HI> and that is too true.</P>
<P>I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he &s;aid; the poor zealous Prie&s;t (I mu&s;t call him &s;o; for, be his Opinion what it will, he had certainly a mo&s;t &s;ingular Affection for the Good of other Mens Souls; and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own) I &s;ay, this zealous affec|tionate Man, could not refrain Tears al&s;o: But, recovering him&s;elf, he &s;aid to me, ask him but one Que&s;tion, Is he ea&s;y that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wi&s;hes it were not &s;o? I put the Que&s;tion fairly to <HI>Atkins,</HI> and he an&s;wered with a great deal of Pa&s;&s;ion, How could any Man be ea&s;y in a Condition that certainly mu&s;t end in eternal De&s;truction? that he was far from being ea&s;y, but that, on the contrary, he believ'd it would one Time or other ruin him.</P>
<P>What do you mean by that? &s;aid I. Why, he &s;aid he believ'd he &s;hould, one Time or other, cut his Throat to put an End to the Terror of it.</P>
<P>The Clergyman &s;hook his Head with a great Concern in his Face, when I told him all this: But
<PB N="165" REF="174">
turning quick to me upon it, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> If that be his Ca&s;e, you may a&s;&s;ure him it is not too late; Chri&s;t will give him Repentance: But pray, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> ex|plain this to him, That as no Man is &s;av'd but by Chri&s;t and the Merit of his Pa&s;&s;ion, procuring di|vine Mercy for him, how can it be too late for any Man to receive Mercy? Does he think he is able to &s;in beyond the Power or Reach of divine Mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a time when provok'd Mercy will no longer &s;trive, and when God may refu&s;e to hear, but that 'tis never too late for Men to ask Mercy; and we that are Chri&s;t's Servants are commanded <HI>to preach</HI> Mercy at all times, <HI>in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to all tho&s;e that &s;incerely repent;</HI> &s;o that 'tis never too late to repent.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Atkins</HI> all this, and he heard me with great Earne&s;tne&s;s; but it &s;eem'd as if he turn'd off the Di&s;cour&s;e to the re&s;t; for he &s;aid to me he would go and have &s;ome Talk with his Wife; &s;o he went out awhile, and we talk'd to the re&s;t. I perceiv'd they were all &s;tupidly ignorant as to Matters of Religion; much as I was when I went rambling away from my Father; and yet that there were none of them backward to hear what had been &s;aid; and all of them &s;eriou&s;ly promis'd that they would talk with their Wives about it, and do their Endeavour to per&s;uade them to turn Chri|&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Clergyman &s;mil'd upon me, when I report|ed what An&s;wer they gave, but &s;aid nothing a good while; but, <HI>at la&s;t,</HI> &s;haking his Head, We that are Chri&s;t's Servants, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> can go no further than to exhort and in&s;truct, and when Men comply, &s;ubmit to the Reproof, and promi&s;e what we
<PB N="166" REF="175">
ask 'tis all we can do; we are bound to accept their good Words: But believe me, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> what|ever you may have known of the Life of that Man you call <HI>Will Atkins,</HI> I believe he is the only &s;incere Convert among them; I take that Man to be a true Penitent; I wont de&s;pair of the re&s;t; but that Man is apparently &s;truck with the Sen&s;e of his pa&s;t Life; and I doubt not, but when he comes to talk Religion to his Wife, he will talk him&s;elf ef|fectually into it; for attempting to teach others, is &s;ometimes the be&s;t way of teaching our &s;elves. I knew a Man, who having nothing but a &s;ummary Notion of Religion him&s;elf, and being wicked and profligate to the la&s;t Degree in his Life, made a thorough Reformation in him&s;elf, by labouring to convert <HI>a Jew.</HI> If that poor <HI>Atkins</HI> begins but once to talk &s;eriou&s;ly of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his Wife, my Life for it, he talks him&s;elf into a thorough Con|vert, makes him&s;elf a Penitent: And who knows what may follow?</P>
<P>Upon this Di&s;cour&s;e however, and their pro|mi&s;ing, as above, to endeavour to per&s;uade their Wives to embrace Chri&s;tianity, he marry'd the other three Couple; but <HI>Will Atkins</HI> and his Wife were not yet come in. After this, my Clergyman, waiting a while, was curious to know where <HI>At|kins</HI> was gone; and, turning to me, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I en|treat you, Sir, let us walk out of your Labyrinth here, and look; I dare &s;ay, we &s;hall find this poor Man &s;omewhere or other talking &s;eriou&s;ly to his Wife, and teaching her already &s;omething of Re|ligion. I began to be of the &s;ame Mind; &s;o we went out together, and I carry'd him a Way which none knew but my &s;elf, and where the Trees were &s;o thick &s;et, as that it was not ea&s;y to &s;ee
<PB N="167" REF="176">
thro' the Thicket of Leaves, and far harder to <HI>&s;ee in,</HI> than to <HI>&s;ee out;</HI> when, coming to the Edge of the Wood, I &s;aw <HI>Atkins</HI> and his tawny Savage Wife &s;itting under the Shade of a Bu&s;h, very eager in Di&s;cour&s;e; I &s;top'd &s;hort till my Clergyman came up to me; and then having &s;how'd him where they were, we &s;tood and look'd very &s;teadi|ly at them a good while.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erv'd him very earne&s;t with her, pointing up to the Sun, and to every Quarter of the Hea|vens, then down to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to him&s;elf, then to her, to the Woods, to the Trees. Now, &s;ays my Clergyman, you &s;ee my Words are made good, the Man preaches to her; mark him now, he is telling her, that our God has made him, and her, and the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, the Woods, the Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I be|lieve he is, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> immediately we perceiv'd <HI>Will Atkins</HI> &s;tart up upon his Feet, fall down on his Knees, and lift up both his Hands: We &s;uppo&s;e he &s;aid &s;omething, but we could not hear him, it was too far for that; he did not continue kneeling half a Minute, but comes and &s;its down again by his Wife, and talks to her again. We perceiv'd then the Woman very attentive, but whether &s;he &s;aid any thing or no we could not tell; while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could &s;ee the Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman's Cheeks, and I could hardly forbear my &s;elf; but it was a great Affliction to us both that we were not near enough to hear any thing that pa&s;s'd between them.</P>
<P>Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear of di&s;turbing them, &s;o we re&s;olv'd to &s;ee an End of this Piece of <HI>&s;till Conver&s;ation,</HI> and it &s;poke
<PB N="168" REF="177">
loud enough to us without the Help of Voice. He &s;at down again, as I have &s;aid, clo&s;e by her, and talk'd again earne&s;tly to her, and two or three times we could &s;ee him embrace her mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionately; another time we &s;aw him take out his Handkerchief and wipe her Eyes, and then ki&s;s her again with a kind of Tran&s;port very unu&s;ual; and after &s;everal of the&s;e Things we &s;ee him, on a &s;udden, jump up again and lend her his Hand to help her up, when immediately, leading her by the Hand a Step or two, they both kneel'd down together, and continu'd &s;o about two Minutes.</P>
<P>My Friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, St. PAUL St. PAUL! <HI>behold he prayeth;</HI> I was afraid <HI>Atkins</HI> would hear him, therefore I entreated him to withhold him&s;elf awhile, that we might &s;ee an End of the Scene, which to me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, was the mo&s;t affecting, and yet the mo&s;t agreeable that ever I &s;aw in my Life: Well, he &s;trove with him&s;elf and contain'd him&s;elf for a while, but was in &s;uch Raptures of Joy, to think that the poor Heathen Woman was become a Chri&s;tian, that he was not able to contain him&s;elf; he wept &s;everal times, then throwing up his Hands and cro&s;&s;ing his Brea&s;t, &s;aid over &s;everal Things Ejaculatory and by way of giving God Thanks for &s;o miraculous a Te&s;timony of the Succe&s;s of our Endeavours; &s;ome he &s;poke &s;oftly, and I could not well hear, others audibly, &s;ome in <HI>Latin,</HI> &s;ome in <HI>French;</HI> then two or three times the Tears of Joy would interrupt him, that he could not &s;peak at all: But I beg'd that he would com|po&s;e him&s;elf, and let us more narrowly and fully ob&s;erve what was before us, which he did for a Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; for after the poor Man and his Wife were ri&s;en
<PB N="169" REF="178">
again from their Knees, we ob&s;erv'd he &s;tood talk|ing &s;till eagerly to her; and we ob&s;erv'd by her Motion, that &s;he was greatly affected with what he &s;aid, by her frequent lifting up her Hands, lay|ing her Hand to her Brea&s;t, and &s;uch other Po&s;|tures, as u&s;ually expre&s;s the greate&s;t Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Attention. This continu'd about half a Quar|ter of an Hour, and then they walk'd away too; &s;o that we could &s;ee no more of them in that Situ|ation.</P>
<P>I took this Interval to talk with my Clergyman: And fir&s;t, I told him, I was glad to &s;ee the Parti|culars we had both been Witne&s;&s;es to; that tho' I was hard enough of Belief in &s;uch Ca&s;es, yet that I began to think it was all very &s;incere here, both in the Man and his Wife, however ignorant they might both be; and I hop'd &s;uch a Beginning would have a yet more happy End; and who knows, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but the&s;e two may in Time, by In|&s;truction and Example, work upon &s;ome of the others? Some of them! <HI>&s;aid he, turning quick upon me,</HI> ay, <HI>upon all of them;</HI> depend upon it, if tho&s;e two Savages, for he has been but little better, as you relate it, &s;hould embrace Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they will never leave 'till they work upon all the re&s;t; for true Religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once made a Chri&s;tian, will never leave a Pagan behind him, if he can help it. I own'd it was a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Principle to think &s;o, and a Te&s;timony of a true Zeal, as well as a generous Heart in him: But, my Friend, &s;aid I, will you give me Leave to &s;tart one Difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object the lea&s;t Thing again&s;t that affectionate Concern, which you &s;hew for the turning the poor People from their Pagani&s;m to the Chri&s;tian Religion: But how does this com|fort
<PB N="170" REF="179">
you, while the&s;e People are in your Account out of the Pale of the Catholick Church, without which you believe there is no Salvation; &s;o that you e&s;teem the&s;e but Hereticks, and for other Rea|&s;ons as effectually lo&s;t as the Pagans them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To this he an&s;wer'd with abundance of Can|dor and Chri&s;tian Charity thus; Sir, I am a Ca|tholick of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and a Prie&s;t of the Order of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> and I embrace all the Prin|ciples of the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith: But yet if you will believe me, <HI>and that I do not &s;peak in Compliment to you, or in re&s;pect to my Circum&s;tances and your Civilities;</HI> I &s;ay, neverthele&s;s, I do not look upon you, who call your &s;elves reform'd, without &s;ome Charity: I dare not &s;ay, <HI>tho' I know it is our Opinion in general;</HI> I &s;ay, I dare not &s;ay that you cannot be &s;av'd: I will by no means limit the Mercy of Chri&s;t &s;o far, as to think that he cannot receive you into the Bo&s;om of his Church in a Manner to us unper|ceivable, and which it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to know, and I hope you have the &s;ame Charity for us; I pray daily for your being all re&s;tor'd to Chri&s;t's Church, by what&s;oever Methods he, who is <HI>Allwi&s;e,</HI> is pleas'd to direct: In the mean time, &s;ure you will allow it to con&s;i&s;t with me, as a <HI>Ro|man,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h far between a Prote&s;tant and a Pagan; between one that calls on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, tho' in a Way which I do not think is according to the true Faith, and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows no God, no Chri&s;t, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the Pale of the Catholick Church, we hope you are nearer being re&s;tor'd to it than tho&s;e that know nothing of God or his Church: And I rejoice therefore when I &s;ee this poor Man, who you &s;ay has been a Profligate, and almo&s;t a Murderer, kneel down and pray
<PB N="171" REF="180">
to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as we &s;uppo&s;e he did, tho' not fully enlighten'd; believing that God, from whom every &s;uch Work proceeds, will &s;en&s;ibly touch his Heart, and bring him to the further Knowledge of that Truth in his own Time; and if God &s;hall influence this poor Man to convert and in&s;truct the ignorant Savage his Wife, I can never believe that he &s;hall be ca&s;t away him&s;elf; and have I not Rea|&s;on then to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, tho' they may not be brought quite home into the Bo&s;om of the Catho|lick Church, ju&s;t at the time when I may de&s;ire it? leaving it to the Goodne&s;s of Chri&s;t to perfect his Work in his own time, and his own way. Cer|tainly I would rejoice if all the Savages in <HI>America</HI> were brought like this poor Woman to pray to God, tho' they were to be all Prote&s;tants at fir&s;t, rather than they &s;hould continue Pagans and Hea|thens; firmly believing, that he that had be&s;tow'd the fir&s;t Light to them, would further illuminate them with a Beam of his heavenly Grace, and bring them into the Pale of his Church when he &s;hould &s;ee good.</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Sincerity and Temper of this truly pious Papi&s;t, as much as I was op|pre&s;s'd by the Power of his Rea&s;oning; and it pre&s;ently occur'd to my Thoughts, that if &s;uch a Temper was univer&s;al, we might be all Catho|lick Chri&s;tians, whatever Church or particular Profe&s;&s;ion we join'd to, or join'd in; that a Spi|rit of Charity would &s;oon work us all up into right Principles; and in a Word, as he thought that the like Charity would make us all Catho|licks, &s;o I told him I believ'd, had all the Mem|bers of his Church the like Moderation, they
<PB N="172" REF="181">
would &s;oon be all Prote&s;tants. And there we left that Part, for we never di&s;puted at all.</P>
<P>However, I talk'd to him another way, and <HI>taking him by the Hand,</HI> my Friend, &s;ays I, I wi&s;h all the Clergy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church were ble&s;t with &s;uch Moderation, and had an equal Share of your Charity. I am entirely of your Opinion; but I mu&s;t tell you, that if you &s;hould preach &s;uch Doc|trine in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> they would put you into the <HI>Inqui&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>It may be &s;o, &s;aid he, I know not what they might do in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> but I will not &s;ay they would be the better Chri&s;tians for that Severity, for I am &s;ure there is no Here&s;y in too much Charity.</P>
<P>Well, as <HI>Will Atkins</HI> and his Wife were gone, our Bu&s;ine&s;s there was over; &s;o we went back our own Way; and when we came back, we found them waiting to be call'd in; ob&s;erving this, I ask'd my Clergyman if we &s;hould di&s;cover to him that we had &s;een him under the Bu&s;h, or no; and it was his Opinion we &s;hould not; but that we &s;hould talk to him fir&s;t, and hear what he would &s;ay to us; &s;o we call'd him in alone, no Body being in the Place but our &s;elves; and I began with him thus:</P>

<P>Ay, Sir, I was bruti&s;h, indeed, I mur|der'd my Father; for God's &s;ake, Sir, talk no more about that, Sir, I murder'd my poor Father.</P>

<P>*<HI>Here the Prie&s;t &s;tarted</HI> (for I interpreted every Word as he &s;poke it) <HI>and look'd pale. It &s;eems be believ'd that</HI> Will <HI>had really kill'd his own Father.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>W.A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat, but I cut the Thread of all his Comforts, and &s;horten'd his Days; I broke his Heart by the mo&s;t ungrate|ful unnatural Return, for the mo&s;t tender affec|tionate Treatment that ever Father gave, or Child could receive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I did not ask you about your Fa|ther to extort this Confe&s;&s;ion; I pray God give you Repentance for it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sms; but I ask'd you, becau&s;e I &s;ee, that tho' you have not much Learning, yet you are not &s;o ignorant as &s;ome are in Things

<SPEAKER>W.A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' you, Sir, did not extort the Con|fe&s;&s;ion that I make about my Father, Con&s;cience does; and when ever we come to look back upon our Lives, the Sins again&s;t our indulgent Parents are certainly the fir&s;t that touch us; the Wounds they make lie deepe&s;t, and the Weight they leave will lie heavie&s;t upon the Mind, of all the Sins we can commit.</P>

</SP>
<P>*<HI>I would have &s;aid more, if I could have re&s;train'd my Pa&s;&s;ions; but I thought this poor Man's Repentance was &s;o much &s;ince|rer than mine, that I was going to leave off the Di&s;cour&s;e and retire, for I was &s;urpriz'd with what he &s;aid; and thought, that in|&s;tead of my going about to teach and in&s;truct him, the Man was made a Teacher and In|&s;tructer to me, in a mo&s;t &s;urprizing and unexpected manner.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="184">I laid all this before the young Clergyman, who was greatly affected with it, and &s;aid to me; Did I not &s;ay, Sir, that when this Man was converted, he would preach to us all?

</SP>
<P><PB N="185" REF="194">
Here the poor Man could forbear no longer; but rai&s;ing her up, made her kneel by him, and he pray'd to God aloud to in&s;truct her in the Knowledge of him&s;elf by his Spirit, and that by &s;ome good Providence, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;he might &s;ometime or other come to have a Bible, that &s;he might read the Word of God, and be taught by it to know him.</P>
<P>This was the Time that we &s;aw him lift her up by the Hand, and &s;aw him kneel down by her, as above.</P>
<P>They had &s;everal other Di&s;cour&s;es it &s;eems after this, too long to &s;et down here; and parti|cularly &s;he made him promi&s;e, that &s;ince he con|fe&s;t his own Life had been a wicked abomi|nable Cour&s;e of Provocation again&s;t God, that he would reform it, and not make God angry any more, lea&s;t he &s;hould <HI>make him dead,</HI> as &s;he call'd it, and then &s;he &s;hould be left alone, and never be taught to know this God better; and lea&s;t he &s;hould be mi&s;erable, as he had told her wicked Men &s;hould be after Death.</P>
<P>This was a &s;trange Account, and very affecting to us both, but particularly to the young Clergy|man; he was indeed wonderfully &s;urpriz'd with it, but under the greate&s;t Affliction imaginable, that he could not talk to her, that he could not &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to make her under&s;tand him; and as &s;he &s;poke but very broken <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he could not under&s;tand her; However he turn'd him&s;elf to me, and told me, that he believed there mu&s;t be more to do with this Woman than to marry her: I did not under&s;tand him at fir&s;t, but at length he
<PB N="186" REF="195">
explain'd him&s;elf, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that &s;he ought to be Baptiz'd.</P>
<P>I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was for going about it pre&s;ently: No, no, hold Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> tho' I would have her be Baptiz'd by all Means, yet I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> her Husband, has indeed brought her in a won|derful Manner to be willing to embrace a reli|gious Life, and has given her ju&s;t Ideas of the Being of a God, of his Power, Ju&s;tice, Mercy; yet I de&s;ire to know of him, if he had &s;aid any Thing to her of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of the Salvati|on of Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him, and Redemption by him, of the holy Spirit, the Re&s;urrection, the la&s;t Judgment, and a future State.</P>
<P>I call'd <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> again, and ask'd him; but the poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and told us he had &s;aid &s;omething to her of all tho&s;e things, but that he was him&s;elf &s;o wicked a Creature, and his own Con&s;cience &s;o reproach'd him with his horrid ungodly Life, that he trem|bled at the Apprehen&s;ions, that her Knowledge of him, &s;hould le&s;&s;en the Attention &s;he &s;hould give to tho&s;e Things, and make her rather con|temn Religion than receive it: But he was a&s;|&s;ur'd he &s;aid that her Mind was &s;o di&s;pos'd to receive due Impre&s;&s;ions of all tho&s;e Things, that if I would but di&s;cour&s;e with her, &s;he would make it appear to my Satisfaction, that my Labour would not be lo&s;t upon her.</P>
<P>According I call'd her in, and placing my &s;elf as Interpreter between my religious Prie&s;t and the Woman, I entreated him to begin with her; but &s;ure &s;uch a Sermon was never preach'd by a popi&s;h Prie&s;t in the&s;e latter Ages of the World; and, <HI>as I</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="196">
<HI>told him,</HI> I thought he had all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Chri&s;tian, with|out the Error of a <HI>Roman Catholick;</HI> and that I took him to be &s;uch a Clergy-man, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Bi&s;hops were before the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> a&s;&s;um'd &s;piritual Sovereignty over the Con&s;ciences of Men.</P>
<P>In a word, he brought the poor Woman to em|brace the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and of Redemp|tion by him, not with Wonder and A&s;toni&s;hment only, as &s;he did the fir&s;t Notions of a God, but with Joy and Faith, with an Affection and a &s;ur|pri&s;ing Degree of Under&s;tanding, &s;carce to be i|magin'd, much le&s;s to be expre&s;s'd; and at her own Reque&s;t &s;he was Baptiz'd.</P>
<P>When he was preparing to Baptize her, I en|treated him that he would perform that Office with &s;ome Caution, that the Man might not per|ceive he was of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, if po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e of other ill Con&s;equences which might attend a Difference among us in that very Reli|gion, which we were in&s;tructing the other in: He told me, that as he had no con&s;ecrated Cha|pel, no proper Things for the Office, I &s;hould &s;ee he would do it in a Manner that I &s;hould not know by it, that he was a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick my &s;elf, if I had not known it before: And &s;o he did; for &s;aying only &s;ome Words over to him&s;elf in <HI>Latin,</HI> which I could not under&s;tand, he pour'd a whole Di&s;h-ful of Water upon the Woman's Head, pro|nouncing in <HI>French,</HI> very loud, MARY, <HI>which was the Name, her Husband de&s;ir'd me to give her; for I was her Godfather,</HI> I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t; &s;o that none could know any Thing by it, what Religion he was of: He gave the Benedicti|on afterwards in <HI>Latin;</HI> but either <HI>Will. Atkins</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="197">
did not know but it was in <HI>French,</HI> or el&s;e did not take Notice of it at that time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was over we married them; and after the Marriage was over he turn'd him|&s;elf to <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> and in a very affectionate Manner exhorted him, not only to pre&s;evere in that good Di&s;potion he was in, but to &s;upport the Convictions that were upon him by a Re&s;o|lution to reform his Life; told him it was in vain to &s;ay he repented, if he did not for&s;ake his Crimes: Repre&s;ented to him, how God had ho|noured him with being the In&s;trument of bring|ing his Wife to the Knowledge of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and that he &s;hould be careful he did not di&s;honour the Grace of God, and that if he did, he would &s;ee the Heathen a better Chri&s;tian than him&s;elf, the Savage converted, and the In&s;trument ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>He &s;aid a great many good Things to them both, and then recommending them in a few Words to God's Goodne&s;s, gave them the Bene|diction again, I repeating every Thing to them in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and thus ended the Ceremony: I think it was the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, agreeable Day to me that ever I pa&s;&s;ed in my whole Life.</P>
<P>But my Clergy-man had not done yet; his Thoughts hung continually upon the Conver&s;ion of the &s;even and thirty Savages, and fain he would have &s;tay'd upon the I&s;land to have un|dertaken it; but I convinc'd him, fir&s;t, that his Undertaking was impracticable in it &s;elf; and &s;econdly, that perhaps I would put it into a Way of being done in his Ab&s;ence to his Sati&s;|faction; of which, by and by.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198">
Having thus brought the Affair of the I&s;land to a narrow Compa&s;s, I was preparing to go on board the Ship, when the young Man who I had taken out of the fami&s;h'd Ship's Company came to me, and told me, he under&s;tood I had a Cler|gyman with me, and that I had cau&s;ed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men to be married to the Savages, whom they called Wives; that he had a Match too, which he de&s;ir'd might be fini&s;h'd before I went, be|tween two Chri&s;tians, which he hop'd would not be di&s;agreeable to me.</P>
<P>I knew this mu&s;t be the young Woman who was his Mother's Servant, for there was no other Chri&s;tian Woman on the I&s;land; &s;o I began to per&s;uade him not to do any Thing of that Kind ra&s;hly, or becau&s;e he found him&s;elf in this &s;oli|tary Circum&s;tance: I repre&s;ented to him that he had &s;ome con&s;iderable Sub&s;tance in the World, and good Friends, as I under&s;tood by him&s;elf, and by his Maid al&s;o; that the Maid was not only poor and a Servant, but was unequal to him, &s;he be|ing &s;ix or &s;even and twenty Years old, and he not above &s;eventeen or eighteen; that he might very probably, with my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, make a remove from this Wilderne&s;s, and come into his own Country again, and that then it would be a thou&s;and to one but he would repent his Choice; and the Di&s;like of that Circum&s;tance might be di&s;advantagious to both: I was going to &s;ay more, but he interrupted me, &s;miling, and told me, with a great deal of Mode&s;ty, that I mi&s;took in my Gue&s;&s;es, that he had nothing of that Kind in his Thoughts, his pre&s;ent Circum&s;tance being melancholly and di&s;con&s;olate enough; and he was very glad to hear that I had Thoughts of put|ting
<PB N="190" REF="199">
them in a Way to &s;ee their Country again, and nothing &s;hould have put him upon &s;taying there, but that the Voyage I was going was &s;o exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the Reach of all his Friends; that he had nothing to de&s;ire of me, but that I would &s;ettle him in &s;ome little Property in the I&s;land where he was, give him a Servant or two and &s;ome few Nece&s;&s;aries, and he would &s;ettle him&s;elf here like a Planter, waiting the good Time, when if ever I return'd to <HI>England,</HI> I would redeem him, and hop'd I would not be unmind|ful of him when I came into <HI>England;</HI> that he would give me &s;ome Letters to his Friends in <HI>London,</HI> to let them know how good I had been to him, and in what Part of the World, and what Circum&s;tance I had left him in; that he promi&s;ed me, that whenever I redeemed him, the Plantation, and all the Improvements he had made upon it, let the Value be what it would, &s;hould be wholly mine.</P>
<P>His Di&s;cour&s;e was very prettily deliver'd, con|&s;idering his Youth, and was the more agreeable to me, becau&s;e he told me po&s;itively the Match was not for him&s;elf: I gave him all po&s;&s;ible A&s;|&s;urances, that if I liv'd to come &s;afe to <HI>England,</HI> I would deliver his Letters and do his Bu&s;ine&s;s effectually, and that he might depend I would never forget the Circum&s;tance I had left him in; but &s;till I was impatient to know who was the Per&s;on to be married, upon which he told me it was my <HI>Jack of all Trades,</HI> and his Maid <HI>Su&s;an.</HI></P>
<P>I was mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpris'd, when he nam'd the Match, for indeed I thought it very &s;uitable; the Character of that Man I have
<PB N="191" REF="200">
given already; and as for the Maid, &s;he was a very hone&s;t, mode&s;t, &s;ober and religious young Woman, had a very good Share of Sen&s;e, was a|greeable enough in her Per&s;on, &s;poke very hand|&s;omely and to the Purpo&s;e, always with Decen|cy and good Manners, and not backward to &s;peak when any Thing required it, or imperti|nently forward to &s;peak when it was not her Bu|&s;ine&s;s; very handy and hou&s;ewifely in any Thing that was before her; an excellent Manager, and fit indeed to have been Governe&s;s to the whole I&s;land; &s;he knew very well how to behave to all kind of Folks &s;he had about her, and to better, if &s;he had found any there.</P>
<P>The Match being propo&s;ed in this Manner, we married them the &s;ame Day, and as I was Father at the Altar, as I may &s;ay, and gave her away, &s;o I gave her a Portion; for I appointed her and her Husband a hand&s;om large Space of Ground for their Plantation; and indeed this Match and the Propo&s;al the young Gentleman made to give him a &s;mall Property in the I&s;land, put me upon parcelling it out among&s;t them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about their Situation.</P>
<P>This &s;haring out the Land to them, I left to <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> who indeed was now grown a mo&s;t &s;ober, grave, managing Fellow, perfectly reform'd, exceeding Pious and Religious, and as far as I may be allow'd to &s;peak po&s;itively in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I verily believe, was a true &s;incere Penitent.</P>
<P>He divided Things &s;o ju&s;tly, and &s;o much to every one's Satisfaction, that they only de&s;ired one general Writing under my Hand for the
<PB N="192" REF="201">
whole, which I cau&s;ed to be drawn up and &s;ign'd and &s;eal'd to them, &s;etting out the Bounds and Situation of every Man's Plantation, and te&s;ti|fying that I gave them thereby &s;everally a Right to the whole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Inheritance of the re&s;pective Plantations or Farms, with their Im|provements to them and their Heirs, re&s;erving all the re&s;t of the I&s;land as my own Property, and a certain Rent for every particular Planta|tion after eleven Years, if I, or any one from me, or in my Name, came to demand it, producing an atte&s;ted Copy of the &s;ame Writing.</P>
<P>As to the Government and Laws among them, I told them I was not capable of giving them better Rules, than they were able to give them|&s;elves, only made them promi&s;e me to live in Love and good Neighbourhood with one ano|ther; and &s;o I prepared to leave them.</P>
<P>One Thing I mu&s;t not omit, and this is, that being now &s;ettled in a Kind of Common-Wealth among them&s;elves, and having much Bu&s;ine&s;s in Hand, it was but odd to have &s;even and thirty <HI>Indians</HI> live in a Nook of the I&s;land, independent, and indeed un-employ'd; for ex|cepting the providing them&s;elves Food, which they had Difficulty enough in too, &s;ometimes, they had no manner of Bu&s;ine&s;s or Property to manage: I propos'd therefore to the Governour <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that he &s;hould go to them with <HI>Friday</HI>'s Father, and propo&s;e to them to remove, and either plant for them&s;elves, or take them into their &s;everal Families as Servants to be maintain'd for their Labour, but without being ab&s;olute Slaves, for I would not admit them to make them Slaves by Force by any Means, becau&s;e
<PB N="193" REF="202">
they had their Liberty given them by Capitu|lation, and as it were Articles of Surrender, which they ought not to break.</P>
<P>They mo&s;t willingly embrac'd the Propo&s;al, and came all very chearfully along with him; &s;o we allotted them Land, and Plantations, which three or four accepted of, but all the re&s;t cho&s;e to be employ'd as Servants in the &s;everal Families we had &s;ettled; and thus my Colony was in a Manner &s;ettled, as follows: The <HI>Spa|niards</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd my original Habitation, which was the Capital City, and extended their Plan|tations all along the &s;ide of the Brook, which made the Creek that I have &s;o often de&s;crib'd, as far as my Bower; and as they increas'd their Culture, it went always Ea&s;tward; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> liv'd in the North-Ea&s;t Part, where <HI>W. Atkins,</HI> and his Comrades began, and came on South|ward, and South-We&s;t, towards the back Part of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and every Plantation had a great Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occa&s;ion, &s;o that they need not jo&s;tle one ano|ther for want of Room.</P>
<P>All the Ea&s;t End of the I&s;land was left uninha|bited, that if any of the Savages &s;hould come on Shore there, only for their u&s;ual cu&s;tomary Bar|barities, they might come and go, if they di&s;turb'd no Body, no Body would di&s;turb them; and no doubt but they were often a&s;hore, and went away again; for I never heard that the Planters were ever attack'd or di&s;turb'd any more.</P>
<P>It now came into my Thoughts, that I had hinted to my Friend the Clergy-man, that the Work of converting the Savages, might perhaps
<PB N="194" REF="203">
be &s;et on foot in his Ab&s;ence, to his Satisfaction; and I told him that now I thought it was put in a fair Way; for the Savages being thus divi|ded among the Chri&s;tians, if they would but every one of them do their part with tho&s;e which came under their Hands, I hop'd it might have a very good Effect.</P>
<P>He agreed pre&s;ently in that, if, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> they will do their Part; but how, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;hall we obtain that of them? I told him, we would call them altogether, and leave it in Charge with them, or go to them one by one, which he thought be&s;t, &s;o we divided it; he to &s;peak to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were all Papi&s;ts, and I to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were all Prote&s;tants; and we re|commended it earne&s;tly to them, and made them promi&s;e, that they never would make any Di|&s;tinction of Papi&s;t or Prote&s;tant, in their ex|horting the Savages to turn Chri&s;tians; but teach them the general Knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and they like|wi&s;e promis'd us, that they would never have any Differences or Di&s;putes one with another, about Religion.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>W. Atkins's Hou&s;e,</HI> I may call it &s;o, for &s;uch a Hou&s;e, or &s;uch a Piece of Basket-Work, I believe, was not &s;tanding in the World again; I &s;ay, when I came there, I found the young Woman I have mention'd above, and <HI>W. Atkins's Wife,</HI> were become Intimates; and this prudent religious young Woman, had per|fected the Work <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> had begun; and tho' it was not above four Days after what I have related, yet the new baptiz'd Savage Wo|man was made &s;uch a Chri&s;tian, as I have &s;el|dom
<PB N="195" REF="204">
heard of any like her in all my Ob&s;ervati|on, or Conver&s;ation, in the World.</P>
<P>It came next into my Mind in the Morning before I went to them, that among&s;t all the needful Things I had to leave with them, I had not left them a Bible, in which, I &s;hew'd my &s;elf le&s;s con&s;idering for them, than my good Friend the Widow was for me, when &s;he &s;ent me the Cargo of an hundred Pounds from <HI>Lis|bon,</HI> where &s;he pack'd up 3 Bibles, and a Prayer|book: However, the good Womans Charity had a greater Extent than ever &s;he imagin'd; for they were re&s;erv'd for the Comfort and In&s;truc|tion of tho&s;e, that made much better U&s;e of them than I had done.</P>
<P>I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when I came to <HI>Will. Atkins</HI>'s Tent or Hou&s;e, and found the young Woman, and <HI>Atkins</HI>'s bap|tiz'd Wife, had been di&s;cour&s;ing of Religion together; for <HI>W. Atkins, told it me, with a great deal of Joy:</HI> I ask'd if they were together now, and he &s;aid, yes; &s;o I went into the Hou&s;e, and he, with me, and we found them together very ear|ne&s;t in Di&s;cour&s;e; O Sir, &s;ays <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> when God has Sinners to reconcile to him&s;elf, and Aliens to bring Home, he never wants a Me&s;&s;en|ger; my Wife has got a new In&s;tructor; I knew I was unworthy, as I was uncapable of that Work; that young Woman has been &s;ent hither from Heaven; &s;he is enough to convert a whole I&s;land of Savages; the young Woman blu&s;h'd, and ro&s;e up to go away, but I de&s;ir'd her to &s;it &s;till; I told her, &s;he had a good Work upon her Hands, and I hop'd God would ble&s;s her in it.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="205">
We talk'd a little, and I did not perceive they had any Book among them, tho' I did not ask; but I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out my Bible; here, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> to <HI>Atkins,</HI> I have brought you an A&s;&s;i&s;tant that perhaps you had not before; the Man was &s;o confounded, that he was not able to &s;peak for &s;ome Time; but recovering him&s;elf, he takes it with both his Hands, and turning to his Wife, here, <HI>my Dear,</HI> &s;ays he; did not I tell you, our God, tho' he lives above, could hear what we &s;aid? Here's the Book I pray'd for, when you and I kneel'd down under the Bu&s;h; now God has heard us, and &s;ent it; when he had &s;aid &s;o, the Man fell into &s;uch Tran&s;ports of a pa&s;&s;ionate Joy, that between the Joy of ha|ving it, and giving God Thanks for it, the Tears run down his Face like a Child that was crying.</P>
<P>The Woman was &s;urpri&s;ed, and was like to have run into a Mi&s;take, that none of us were aware of; for &s;he firmly believ'd God had &s;ent the Book upon her Husband's Petition; It is true, that providentially it was &s;o, and might be ta|ken &s;o in a con&s;equent Sen&s;e; but I believ'd it would have been no difficult Matter at that Time, to have per&s;uaded the poor Woman to have be|liev'd, that an expre&s;s Me&s;&s;enger came from Hea|ven, on purpo&s;e to bring that individual Book; but it was too &s;erious a Matter, to &s;uffer any De|lu&s;ion to take Place; &s;o I turn'd to the young Woman and told her we did not de&s;ire to im|po&s;e upon the new Convert, in her fir&s;t, and more ignorant under&s;tanding of Things; and begg'd her to explain to her, that God may be very properly &s;aid to an&s;wer our Petitions, when in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, &s;uch Things are
<PB N="197" REF="206">
in a particular Manner brought to pa&s;s, as we petition'd for; but we do not expect Returns from Heaven, in a miraculous and particular Manner, and that it is our Mercy, that it is not &s;o.</P>
<P>This the young Woman did afterwards effe|ctually; &s;o that there was I a&s;&s;ure you, no Prie&s;t|craft u&s;ed here; and I &s;hould have thought it one of the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable Frauds in the World, to have had it &s;o; but the Surpri&s;e of Joy upon <HI>Will. Atkins,</HI> is really not to be expre&s;|&s;ed; and there we may be &s;ure, there was no Delu&s;ion: Sure, no Man was ever more thank|ful in the World for any Thing of its Kind, than he was for this Bible; nor I believe, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a better Princi|ple; and tho' he had been a mo&s;t profligate Crea|ture, de&s;perate, head&s;trong, outragious, furious, and wicked to a great Degree; yet this Man is a &s;tanding Rule to us all, for the well in&s;truct|ing Children, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that Parents &s;hould never give over to teach and in&s;truct, or ever de&s;pair of the Succe&s;s of their Endeavours, let the Chil|dren be ever &s;o ob&s;tinate, refractory, or to Ap|pearance, in&s;en&s;ible of In&s;truction; for if ever God in his Providence, touches the Con&s;ciences of &s;uch, the Force of their Education returns upon them, and the early In&s;truction of Parents is not lo&s;t; tho' it may have been many Years laid a&s;leep; but &s;ome Time or other, they may find the Benefit of it.</P>
<P>Thus it was with this poor Man; However ig|norant he was, or dive&s;ted of Religion and Chri|&s;tian Knowledge: He found he had &s;ome to do with now, more ignorant than him&s;elf; and that the lea&s;t Part of the In&s;truction of his good
<PB N="198" REF="207">
Father that could now come to his Mind, was of U&s;e to him.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t it occurr'd to him, he &s;aid, how his Father us'd to in&s;i&s;t much upon the in|expre&s;&s;ible Value of the Bible; the Privilege and Ble&s;&s;ing of it to Nations, Families, and Per&s;ons; but he never entertain'd the lea&s;t Notion of the Worth of it, till now; when being to talk to Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of the written Oracle for his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The young Woman was very glad of it al&s;o for the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, tho' &s;he had one, and &s;o had the Youth on board our Ship among their Goods, which were not yet brought on Shore; and now having &s;aid &s;o many Things of this young Woman, I cannot omit telling one Story more of her, and my &s;elf, which has &s;omething in it very informing and remarkable.</P>
<P>I have related, to what Extremity the poor young Woman was reduced; how her Mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;tarv'd to Death, and did die on board that unhappy Ship we met at Sea; and how the whole Ship's Company being reduc'd to the la&s;t Extremity; the Gentlewoman, and her Son, and this Maid, were fir&s;t hardly u&s;ed as to Pro|vi&s;ions; and at la&s;t totally neglected and &s;tarv'd; that is to &s;ay, brought to the la&s;t Extremity of Hunger.</P>
<P>One Day being di&s;cour&s;ing with her upon the Extremities they &s;uffer'd, I ask'd her if &s;he could de&s;cribe by what &s;he had felt, what it was to &s;tarve, and how it appear'd; &s;he told me, &s;he
<PB N="199" REF="208">
believ'd &s;he could; and &s;he told her Tale very di&s;tinctly thus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"Fir&s;t, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, we had for &s;ome Days far'd exceeding hard, and &s;uffer'd very great Hunger; but now at la&s;t, we were wholly without Food of any Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine, and a little Water. The fir&s;t Day, after I had receiv'd no Food at all, I found my &s;elf towards Evening, fir&s;t empty and &s;icki&s;h at my Stomach, and nearer Night mightily enclin'd to yawn|ing and &s;leepy; I laid down on a Couch in the great Cabin to &s;leep, and &s;lept about three Hours, and awak'd a little refre&s;h'd; having taken a Gla&s;s of Wine when I lay down; af|ter being about three Hours awake, it being about five a-Clock in the Morning, I found my &s;elf empty and my Stomach &s;icki&s;h, and lay'd down again, but could not &s;leep at all, being very faint, and ill; and thus I continu'd all the &s;econd Day, with a &s;trange Variety, fir&s;t Hungry, then &s;ick again, with reachings to vo|mit; the &s;econd Night being oblig'd to go to Bed again, without any Food, more than a Draught of fair Water; and being a&s;leep, I dream'd I was at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and that the Mar|ket was mightily &s;tock'd with Provi&s;ions; that I bought &s;ome for my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and went and din'd very heartily.</P>
<P>"I thought my Stomach was as full after this as any would have been after, or at a good Dinner; but when I wak'd, I was exceedingly &s;unk in my Spirits, to find my &s;elf in the ex|tremity of Famine: The la&s;t Gla&s;s of Wine we had, I drank, and put Sugar in it, becau&s;e, of its having &s;ome Spirit to &s;upply Nouri&s;hment;
<PB N="200" REF="209">
but there being no Sub&s;tance in the Stomach for the dige&s;ting Office to work upon, I found the only effect of the Wine was, to rai&s;e di&s;|agreeable Fumes from the Stomach, into the Head; and I lay, as they told me, &s;tupid, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, as one drunk for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>"The third Day in the Morning, after a Night of &s;trange and confus'd incon&s;i&s;tent Dreams; and rather dozing than &s;leeping, I wak'd, ravenous and furious, with Hunger; and I que&s;tion, had not my Under&s;tanding re|turn'd and conquer'd it? I &s;ay, I que&s;tion whe|ther if I had been a Mother, and had had a lit|tle Child with me, its Life would have been &s;afe or not?</P>
<P>"This la&s;ted about three Hours; during which Time I was twice raging mad as any Creature in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> as my young Ma&s;ter told me, and as he can now inform you.</P>
<P>"In one of the&s;e Fits of Lunacy or Di&s;tracti|on, whether by the Motion of the Ship, or &s;ome Slip of my Foot, I know not; I fell down, and &s;truck my Face again&s;t the Corner of a Palat Bed in which my Mi&s;tre&s;s lay; and with the Blow the Blood gu&s;h'd out of my No&s;e; and the Cabin Boy bringing me a little Ba&s;on, I &s;at down and bled into it a great deal; and as the Blood run from me, I came to my &s;elf; and the Violence of the Flame or the Fever, I was in, abated, and &s;o did the ravenous Part of the Hunger.</P>
<P>"Then I grew &s;ick, and reach'd to Vomit, but could not; for I had nothing in my Stomach to bring up: After I had bled &s;ome Time, I
<PB N="201" REF="210">
&s;woon'd, and they all believ'd I was dead; but I came to my &s;elf &s;oon after, and then had a mo&s;t dreadful Pain in my Stomach, not to be de&s;cri|bed; not like the Cholick, but a gnawing ea|ger Pain for Food; and towards Night it went off with a kind of earne&s;t Wi&s;hing or Longing for Food; &s;omething like, as I &s;uppo&s;e, the Longing of a Woman with Child. I took ano|ther Draught of Water with Sugar in it, but my Stomach loathed the Sugar, and brought it all up again; then I took a Draught of Wa|ter without Sugar, and that &s;tay'd with me; and I laid me down upon the Bed, praying mo&s;t heartily, that it would plea&s;e God to take me away; and compo&s;ing my Mind in Hopes of it, I &s;lumber'd awhile, and then waking, thought my &s;elf dying, being light with Vapours from an empty Stomach, I re|commended my Soul then to God, and ear|ne&s;tly wi&s;h'd that &s;ome Body would throw me into the Sea.</P>
<P>"All this while my Mi&s;tre&s;s lay by me ju&s;t as I thought expiring, but bore it with much more Patience than I, and gave the la&s;t bit of Bread &s;he had left to her Child, my young Ma&s;ter, who would not have taken it, but &s;he oblig'd him to eat it; and I believe it &s;av'd his Life.</P>
<P>"Towards the Morning I &s;lept again, and fir&s;t when I awak'd, I fell into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion of Cry|ing, and after that had a &s;econd Fit of violent Hunger; I got up ravenous, and in a mo&s;t dreadful Condition; had my Mi&s;tre&s;s been dead, as much as I lov'd her, I am certain, I &s;hould have eaten a Piece of her Fle&s;h, with as much Reli&s;h, and as unconcern'd, as ever I did the the Fle&s;h of any Creature appointed for Food;
<PB N="202" REF="211">
and once or twice I was going to bite my own Arm: At la&s;t, I &s;aw the Ba&s;on in which was the Blood I had bled at my No&s;e the Day be|fore; I ran to it, and &s;wallow'd it with &s;uch Ha&s;te, and &s;uch a greedy Appetite, as if I had wonder'd no Body had taken it before, and afraid it &s;hould be taken from me now.</P>
<P>"Tho' after it was down, the Thoughts of it fill'd me with Horror, yet it check'd the Fit of Hunger, and I drank a Draught of fair Water, and was compos'd and refre&s;h'd for &s;ome Hours after it: This was the 4th Day, and thus I held it, 'till towards Night, when within the Com|pa&s;s of three Hours, I had all the&s;e &s;everal Cir|cum&s;tances over again, one after another, <HI>(viz.)</HI> &s;ick, &s;leepy, eagerly hungry, Pain in the Sto|mach, then ravenous again, then &s;ick again, then lunatick, then crying, then ravenous a|gain; and &s;o every quarter of an Hour, and my Strength wa&s;ted exceedingly: At Night I laid me down, having no Comfort, but in the Hope that I &s;hould die before Morning.</P>
<P>"All this Night I had no Sleep; but the Hun|ger was now turn'd into a Di&s;ea&s;e; and I had a terrible Cholick and Griping, by Wind in&s;tead of Food, having found its Way into the Bow|els; and in this Condition I lay 'till Morning, when I was &s;urpriz'd a little with the Cries and Lamentations of my young Ma&s;ter, who call'd out to me that his Mother was dead: I lifted my &s;elf up a little; for I had not Strength to ri&s;e, but found &s;he was not dead, tho' &s;he was able to give very little Signs of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="212">
"I had then &s;uch Convul&s;ions in my Stomach, for want of &s;ome &s;u&s;tenance, that I cannot de|&s;cribe; with &s;uch frequent Throws and Pangs of Appetite, that nothing but the Tortures of Death can imitate; and in this Condition I was when I heard the Seamen above cry out <HI>a Sail, a Sail,</HI> and hallow and jump about, as if they were di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>"I was not able to get off from the Bed, and my Mi&s;tre&s;s much le&s;s; and my young Ma&s;ter was &s;o &s;ick, that I thought he had been expi|ring; &s;o we could not open the the Cabin-Door, or get any Account what it was as oc|ca&s;ion'd &s;uch a Combu&s;tion, nor had we had any Conver&s;ation with the Ship's Company for two Days; they having told us, that they had not a Mouthful of any Thing to eat in the Ship; and they told us afterwards, they thought we had been dead.</P>
<P>"It was this dreadful Condition we were in when you were &s;ent to &s;ave our Lives; and how you found us, Sir, you know as well as I, and better too.</P></Q></P>
<P>This was her own Relation, and is &s;uch a di|&s;tinct Account of &s;tarving to Death, as I confe&s;s, I never met with, and was exceeding entertain|ing to me; I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true Account, becau&s;e the Youth gave me an Account of a good Part of it; tho' I mu&s;t own, not &s;o di&s;tinct and &s;o feelingly as his Maid; and the rather, becau&s;e it &s;eems his Mother fed him at the Price of her own Life: But the poor Maid, tho' her Con&s;titution being &s;tronger than that of
<PB N="204" REF="213">
her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who was in Years, and a weakly Woman too, &s;he might &s;truggle harder with it; I &s;ay, the poor Maid might be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel the Extremity &s;omething &s;ooner than her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who might be allowed to keep the la&s;t Bit &s;ome|thing longer than &s;he parted with any to relieve the Maid. No Que&s;tion, as the Ca&s;e is here re|lated, if our Ship, or &s;ome other, had not &s;o pro|videntially met them, a few Days more would have ended all their Lives, unle&s;s they had pre|vented it by eating one another; and even, that as their Ca&s;e &s;tood, would have &s;erv'd them but a little while, they being 500 Leagues from any Land, or any Po&s;&s;ibility of Relief, other than in the miraculous Manner it happen'd: But this is by the Way; I return to my Di&s;po&s;ition of Things among the People.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is to be ob&s;erv'd here, That for many Rea&s;ons I did not think fit to let them know any Thing of the Sloop I had fram'd, and which I thought of &s;etting up among them; for I found, <HI>at lea&s;t at my fir&s;t coming,</HI> &s;uch Seeds of Divi&s;ions among them, that I &s;aw it plainly had I &s;et up the Sloop, and left it among them, they would upon every light Di&s;gu&s;t have &s;epe|rated, and gone away from one another, or per|haps have turn'd Pirates, and &s;o made the I&s;land a Den of Thieves, in&s;tead of a Planta|tion of &s;ober and religious People, &s;o as I in|tended it; nor did I leave the two Pieces of Bra&s;s Cannon that I had on Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns, that my Nephew took ex|traordinarily for the &s;ame Rea&s;on: I thought it was enough to qualify them for a defen&s;ive War again&s;t any that &s;hould invade them; but not to &s;et them up for an offen&s;ive War, or to encourage them to go Abroad to attack others,
<PB N="205" REF="214">
which in the End would only bring Ruin and De&s;truction upon them&s;elves and all their Un|dertaking: I re&s;erv'd the Sloop therefore, and the Guns, for their Service another Way, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve in its Place.</P>
<P>I have now done with the I&s;land: I left them all in good Circum&s;tances, and in a flouri&s;hing Condition, and went on board my Ship again the of, having been five and twenty Days among them; and as they were all re&s;olv'd to &s;tay upon the I&s;land 'till I came to remove them, I promis'd to &s;end &s;ome further Relief from the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> if I could po&s;&s;ibly find an Opportunity; and particularly I promis'd to &s;end them &s;ome Cattel, &s;uch as Sheep, Hogs, and Cows: For as to the two Cows and Calves which I brought from <HI>England,</HI> we had been oblig'd by the Length of our Voyage to kill them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed them.</P>
<P>The next Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns at parting, we &s;et &s;ail, and arriv'd at the Bay of <HI>All-Saints</HI> in the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> in about 22 Days; meeting nothing remarkable in our Pa&s;&s;age, but this, That about three Days after we &s;ail'd, being becalm'd, and the Current &s;etting &s;trong to the E.N.E. running, as it were, into a Bay or Gulph on the Land Side, we were driven &s;omething out of our Cour&s;e, and once or twice our Men cry'd Land to the Ea&s;tward; but whether it was the Continent or I&s;lands, we could not tell by any Means.</P>
<P>But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea &s;mooth, and the Weather calm, we &s;aw the Sea, as it were, cover'd towards the Land with &s;ome|thing
<PB N="206" REF="215">
very black, not being able to di&s;cover what it was, 'till after &s;ome Time, our chief Mate go|ing up the main Shrowds a little Way, and look|ing at them with a Per&s;pective, cry'd out it was an Army, I could not imagine what he meant by an Army, and &s;poke a little ha&s;tily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or &s;ome &s;uch Word: Nay, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> don't be angry, for 'tis an Army and a Fleet too; for I believe there are a thou&s;and Ca|noes, and you may &s;ee them paddle along, and they are coming towards us too, apace.</P>
<P>I was a little &s;urpriz'd then indeed, and &s;o was my Nephew, the Captain; for he had heard &s;uch terrible Stories of them in the I&s;land, and having never been in tho&s;e Seas before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but &s;aid two or three Times, we &s;hould all be devour'd. I mu&s;t confe&s;s con&s;idering we were becalm'd, and the Current &s;et &s;trong towards the Shore, I lik'd it the wor&s;e: However, I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an Anchor, as &s;oon as we came &s;o near to know that we mu&s;t engage them.</P>
<P>The Weather continu'd calm, and they came on apace towards us; &s;o I gave Order to come to an Anchor, and furle all our Sails: As for the Savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but Fire; and therefore they &s;hould get their Boats out, and fa&s;ten them, one clo&s;e by the Head, and the other by the Stern, and man them both well, and wait the I&s;&s;ue in that Po&s;ture: This I did, that the Men in the Boats might be ready with Skeets and Buckets to put out any Fire the&s;e Savages might endeavour to fix to the Out-&s;ide of the Ship.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture we lay by for them, and in a lit|tle while they came up with us; but never was
<PB N="207" REF="216">
&s;uch a horrid Sight &s;een by Chri&s;tians: My Mate was much mi&s;taken in his Calculation of their Number, I mean of a thou&s;and Canoes; the mo&s;t we could make of them when they came up, be|ing about a hundred and &s;ix and twenty; and a great many of them too; for &s;ome of them had &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Men in them, and &s;ome more; and the lea&s;t &s;ix or &s;even.</P>
<P>When they came nearer to us they &s;eem'd to be &s;truck with Wonder and A&s;toni&s;hment, as at a Sight which they had doubtle&s;s never &s;een before; nor could they at fir&s;t, as we afterwards under|&s;tood, know what to make of us: They came boldly up however very near to us, and &s;eem'd to go about to row round us; but we call'd to our Men in the Boats, not to let them come too near them.</P>
<P>This very Order brought us to an Engage|ment with them, without our de&s;igning it; for five or &s;ix of their large Canoes came &s;o near our Long-Boat, that our Men beckon'd with their Hands to them to keep back, which they under|&s;tood very well, and went back; but at their Retreat, about 50 Arrows came on board us from tho&s;e Boats; and one of our Men in the Long-Boat was very much wounded.</P>
<P>However, I call'd to them not to fire by any Means; but we handed down &s;ome Deal-Boards into the Boat, and the Carpenter pre&s;ently &s;et up a kind of a Fence, like wa&s;te Boards, to cover them from the Arrows of the Savages, if they &s;hould &s;hoot again.</P>

About half an Hour afterwards they came all up in a Body a-&s;tern of us, and pretty near us, &s;o near that we could ea&s;ily di&s;cern what they were, tho' we could not tell their De&s;ign: And I ea&s;ily found they were &s;ome of my old Friends, the &s;ame Sort of Savages that I had been u&s;ed to engage with; and in a little Time more they row'd a lit|tle farther out to Sea, 'till they came directly Broad-&s;ide with us, and then row'd down &s;trait upon us, 'till they came &s;o near, that they could hear us &s;peak: Upon this I order'd all my Men to keep clo&s;e, lea&s;t they &s;hould &s;hoot any more Arrows, and made all our Guns ready; but be|ing &s;o near as to be within hearing, I made <HI>Friday</HI> go out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to them in his Language to know what they meant, which accordingly he did; whether they under&s;tood him or not, that I knew not: But as &s;oon as he had call'd to them, &s;ix of them, who were in the fore|mo&s;t or nighe&s;t Boat to us, turns their Canoes from us; and &s;tooping down, &s;hew'd us their na|ked Back&s;ides, ju&s;t as if in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;aving your Pre&s;ence, they had <HI>bid us ki&s;s</HI>&mdash;; whether this was a Defiance or Challenge, we know not; or whether it was done in meer Contempt, or as a Signal to the re&s;t; but immediately <HI>Friday</HI> cry'd out they were going to &s;hoot, and unhappily for him poor Fellow; they let fly about 300 of their Arrows, and, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief, kill'd poor <HI>Friday,</HI> no other Man being in their Sight. The poor Fellow was &s;hot with no le&s;s than three Arrows, and about three more fell very near him; &s;uch unlucky Mark&s;men they were.</P>
<P>I was &s;o enrag'd with the Lo&s;s of my old Ser|vant, the Companion of all my Sorrows and Soli|tudes,
<PB N="209" REF="218">
that I immediately order'd five Guns to be loaded with &s;mall Shot, and four with great, and gave them &s;uch a Broad-&s;ide, as they had never heard in their Lives before, to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>They were not above half a Cable Length off when we fir'd; and our Gunners took their Aim &s;o well, that three or four of their Canoes were over&s;et, as we had rea&s;on to believe, by one Shot only.</P>
<P>The ill manners of turning up their bare Back|&s;ides to us, gave us no great Offence; neither did I know for certain, whether that which would pa&s;s for the greate&s;t Contempt among us, might be under&s;tood &s;o by them, or not; therefore in Re|turn, I had only re&s;olv'd to have fir'd four or five Guns at them with Powder only, which I knew would fright them &s;ufficiently: But when they &s;hot at us directly with all the Fury they were capable of, and e&s;pecially as they had kill'd my poor <HI>Friday,</HI> who I &s;o entirely lov'd and valu'd, and who indeed &s;o well de&s;erv'd it; I not only had been ju&s;tify'd before God and Man, but would have been very glad, if I could, to have over&s;et every Canoe there, and drown'd every one of them.</P>
<P>I can neither tell, how many we kill'd, or how many we wounded at this Broad-&s;ide; but &s;ure &s;uch a Fright and Hurry never was &s;een among &s;uch a Multitude; there were 13 or 14 of their Canoes &s;plit and over&s;et in all, and the Men all &s;et a &s;wimming; the re&s;t frighted out of their Wits, &s;cour'd away as fa&s;t as they could, taking but lit|tle care to &s;ave tho&s;e who&s;e Boats were &s;plit or &s;poil'd with our Shot: So I &s;uppo&s;e, that they
<PB N="210" REF="219">
were many of them lo&s;t: And our Men took up one poor Fellow &s;wimming for his Life, above an Hour after they were all gone.</P>
<P>Our &s;mall Shot from our Cannon mu&s;t needs kill and wound a great many; but, in &s;hort, we never knew any Thing how it went with them; for they fled &s;o fa&s;t, that in three Hours or there|abouts, we could not &s;ee above three or four &s;trag|gling Canoes; nor did we ever &s;ee the re&s;t any more; for a Breeze of Wind &s;pringing up the &s;ame Evening, we weighed and &s;et Sail for the <HI>Bra&s;ils.</HI></P>
<P>We had a Pri&s;oner indeed; but the Creature was &s;o &s;ullen, that he would neither eat or &s;peak; and we all fan&s;ied he would &s;tarve him&s;elf to Death: But I took a way to cure him; for I made them take him and turn him into the Long|boat, and make him believe they would to&s;s him into the Sea again, and &s;o leave him where they found him, if he would not &s;peak: Nor would that do; but they really did throw him into the Sea, and came away from him; and then he follow'd them; for he &s;wam like a Cork, and call'd to them in his Tongue, tho' they knew not one Word of what he &s;aid: However, at la&s;t they took him in again, and then he began to be more tractable; nor did I ever de&s;ign they &s;hould drown him.</P>
<P>We were now under Sail again; but I was the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate Creature alive, for want of my Man <HI>Friday,</HI> and would have been very glad to have gone back to the I&s;land, to have taken one of the re&s;t from thence for my Occa&s;ion, but it could not be; &s;o we went on. We had one Pri&s;oner, as I
<PB N="211" REF="220">
have &s;aid; and 'twas a long while before we could make him under&s;tand any thing: But, in time, our Men taught him &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and he began to be a little tractable; afterwards we enquir'd what Country he came from, but could mke no|thing of what he &s;aid; for his Speech was &s;o odd, all Gutturals, and &s;poke in the Throat in &s;uch an hollow odd manner, that we could never form a Word from him; and we were all of opinion, that they might &s;peak that Language as well, if they were gagg'd, as otherwi&s;e: Nor could we perceive that they had any Occa&s;ion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips or Palat; but form'd their Words, ju&s;t as a hunting Horn forms a Tune with an open Throat; he told us however, &s;ome time af|ter when we had taught him to &s;peak a little <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they were going with their Kings to fight a great Battle. When he &s;aid Kings, we ask'd him how many Kings? He &s;aid, they were FIVE NATION, we could not make him under&s;tand the Plural S. and that they all join'd to go again&s;t <HI>Two Nation.</HI> We ask'd him, what made them come up to us? He &s;aid, <HI>to makee te great Wonder look:</HI> Where it is to be ob&s;erved, That all tho&s;e Natives, as al&s;o tho&s;e of <HI>Africa,</HI> when they learn <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they always add two E's at the End of the Words where we u&s;e one, and make the Ac|cent upon them, as <HI>mak&egrave;&egrave; tak&egrave;&egrave;,</HI> and the like; and we could not break them of it; nay, I could hard|ly make <HI>Friday</HI> leave it off, tho' at la&s;t he did.</P>
<P>And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I mu&s;t take my la&s;t Leave of him; poor hone&s;t <HI>Friday!</HI> We buried him with all the Decency and Solemnity po&s;&s;ible, by putting him into a Coffin, and throwing him into the Sea: And I caus'd'em to fire eleven Guns for him; and &s;o ended the
<PB N="212" REF="221">
Life of the mo&s;t grateful, faithful, hone&s;t, and mo&s;t affectionate Servant, that ever Man had.</P>
<P>We went now away with a fair Wind for <HI>Bra|&s;il,</HI> and in about twelve Days Time we made Land in the Latitude of five Degrees South of the Line, being the North-Ea&s;termo&s;t Land of all that Part of <HI>America.</HI> We kept on S. by E. in Sight of the Shore four Days, when we made <HI>Cape St. Augu|&s;tine,</HI> and in three Days came to an Anchor off of <HI>the Bay of all Saints,</HI> the old Place of my Delive|rance, from whence came both my good and evil Fate.</P>
<P>Never Ship came to this Part that had le&s;s Bu|&s;ine&s;s than I had; and yet it was with great Diffi|culty that we were admitted to hold the lea&s;t Corre&s;pondence on Shore, not my Partner him&s;elf, who was alive, and made a great Figure among them; not my two Merchants Tru&s;tees, not the Fame of my wonderful Pre&s;ervation in that I&s;land, could obtain me that Favour: But my Partner re|membring, that I had given 500 Moidores to the Prior of the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Augu&s;tines,</HI> and 272 to the Poor, went to the Mona&s;tery, and oblig'd the Prior that then was, to go to the Governor, and get leave for me per&s;onally, with the Captain and one more be&s;ides Eight Seamen, to come on Shore, and no more; and this upon Condition ab&s;olutely capitulated for, that we &s;hould not of|fer to land any Goods out of the Ship, or to carry any Per&s;on away without Licence.</P>
<P>They were &s;o &s;trict with us, as to landing any Goods, that it was with extream Difficulty that I got on Shore three Bales of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, &s;uch
<PB N="213" REF="222">
as fine broad Cloaths, Stuffs, and &s;ome Linnen which I had brought for a Pre&s;ent to my Partner.</P>
<P>He was a very generous broad hearted Man, tho' like me, he came from little at fir&s;t; and tho' he knew not that I had the lea&s;t De&s;ign of giving him any Thing, he &s;ent me on Board a Pre&s;ent of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, Wine, and Sweet-meats, worth above 30 Moidores, including &s;ome Tobacco, and three or four fine Medals in Gold: But I was even with him in my Pre&s;ent, which, as I have &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of fine broad Cloath, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stuffs, Lace, and fine Hollands: Al&s;o I deliver'd him about the Value of 100 <HI>lib. Sterl</HI> in the &s;ame Goods for other U&s;es; and I oblig'd him to &s;et up the Sloop which I had brought with me from <HI>England,</HI> as I have &s;aid, for the U&s;e of my Colo|ny, in order to &s;end the Refre&s;hments I intended to my Plantation.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he got Hands, and fini&s;h'd the Sloop in a very few Days, for &s;he was already fram'd, and I gave the Ma&s;ter of her &s;uch In&s;tru|ctions, as he could not mi&s;s the Place, <HI>nor did he mi&s;s them, as I had an Account from my Partner after|wards.</HI> I got him &s;oon loaded with the &s;mall Cargo I &s;ent them; and one of our Seamen that had been on &s;hore with me there, offer'd to go with the Sloop, and &s;ettle there upon my Letter to the Governor <HI>Spaniard,</HI> to allot him a &s;uffici|ent Quantity of Land for a Plantation; and giving him &s;ome Cloaths and Tools for his Planting-Work, which he &s;aid he under&s;tood, having been an old Planter at <HI>Maryland,</HI> and a Buckaneer in|to the Bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223">
I encouraged the Fellow, by granting all he de&s;ired; and as an Addition, I gave him the Sa|vage, which we had taken Pri&s;oner of War, to be his Slave, and order'd the Governour <HI>Spaniard</HI> to give him his &s;hare of every thing he wanted, with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>When we came to fit this Man out, my old Partner told me, there was a certain very hone&s;t Fellow, a <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Planter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen into the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Church; I know not what the matter is with him, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> but on my Con&s;cience, I think he is a Heretick in his Heart, and he has been obliged to conceal him&s;elf for fear of the Inqui&s;ition; that he would be very glad of &s;uch an Opportunity to make his E&s;cape with his Wife and two Daughters; and if I would let them go to my I&s;land, and allot them a Plantation, he would give them a &s;mall &s;tock to begin with; for the Officers of the Inqui&s;ition had &s;eiz'd all his Effects and E&s;tate, and he had nothing left but a little Hou&s;hold Stuff and two Slaves. And, <HI>adds he,</HI> Tho' I hate his Principles, yet I would not have him fall into their Hands; for he would a&s;&s;uredly be burnt alive, if he does.</P>
<P>I granted this pre&s;ently, and join'd my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man with them, and we conceal'd the Man, and his Wife and Daughters on Board our Ship, till the Sloop put out to go to Sea; and then (having put all their Goods on board the Sloop, &s;ome time before) we put them on board the Sloop, after he was got out of the Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="224">
Our Seamen was mightily pleas'd with this new Partner; and their Stock indeed was much alike rich in Tools, in Preparations, and a Farm, but nothing to begin with, but as above: However, they carried over with them, which was worth all the re&s;t, &s;ome Materials for planting Sugar Canes, with &s;ome Plants of Canes; which he, I mean, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Man, under&s;tood very well.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the Supplies &s;ent my Tenants in the I&s;land, I &s;ent them by their Sloop, three Milch Cows, and five Calves, about 22 Hogs a|mong 'em, three Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and a Stone-Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>For my <HI>Spaniards,</HI> according to my Promi&s;e, I engag'd three <HI>Portugal</HI> Women to go, and recom|mended it to them to marry them, and u&s;e them kindly. I could have procured more Women, but I remember'd, that the poor per&s;ecuted Man had two Daughters, and there was but five of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that wanted; the re&s;t had Wives of their own, tho' in another Country.</P>
<P>All this Cargoe arriv'd &s;afe, and as you may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, very welcome to my old Inhabi|tants, who were now with this Addition between &s;ixty and &s;eventy People, be&s;ides little Children; of which, there was a great many: I found Let|ters at <HI>London</HI> from them all by the Way of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> when I came back to <HI>England;</HI> of which I &s;hall al&s;o take &s;ome Notice immediately.</P>
<P>I have now done with my I&s;land, and all Man|ner of Di&s;cour&s;e about it; and whoever reads the re&s;t of my Memorandums, would do well to turn
<PB N="216" REF="225">
his Thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the Follies of an old Man, not warn'd by his own Harms, much le&s;s by tho&s;e of other Men, to beware of the like; not cool'd by almo&s;t forty Years Mi&s;ery and Di&s;appointments, not &s;atisfy'd with Pro&s;perity beyond Expectation, not made cautious by Affliction and Di&s;tre&s;s beyond Imi|tation.</P>
<P>I had no more Bu&s;ine&s;s to go to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> than a Man at full Liberty, and having committed no Crime, has to go to the Turn-key at <HI>Newgate,</HI> and de&s;ire him to lock him up among the Pri&s;oners there, and &s;tarve him. Had I taken a &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;el from <HI>England,</HI> and went directly to the I&s;land; had I loaded her, as I did the other Ve&s;&s;el, with all the Nece&s;&s;aries for the Plantation, and for my People took a Patent from the Government here, to have &s;ecur'd my Property, in &s;ubjection only to that of <HI>England;</HI> had I carried over Cannon and Ammunition, Servants and People, to plant, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place, fortified and &s;treng|then'd it in the Name of <HI>England,</HI> and increas'd it with People, as I might ea&s;ily have done; had I then &s;ettl'd my &s;elf there, and &s;ent the Ship back, loaden with good Rice, as I might al&s;o have done in &s;ix Months time, and order'd my Friends to have fitted her out again for our Supply; had I done this, and &s;taid there my &s;elf, I had, at lea&s;t, acted like a Man of common &s;en&s;e; but I was po&s;|&s;e&s;t with a wandring Spirit, &s;corned all Advan|tages, I plea&s;ed my &s;elf with being the Patron of tho&s;e People I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty maje&s;tick Way, like an old Patri|archal Monarch; providing for them, as if I had been Father of the whole Family, as well as of the Plantation: But I never &s;o much as pretended
<PB N="217" REF="226">
to plant in the Name of any Government or Nation, or to acknowledge any Prince, or to call my People Subjects to any one Nation more than another; nay, I never &s;o much as gave the Place a Name; but left it as I found it, be|longing to no Man; and the People under no Di|&s;cipline or Government but my own; who, tho' I had influence over them as Father and Benefa|ctor, had no Authority or Power, to Act or Command one way or other, farther than vo|luntary Con&s;ent mov'd them to comply; yet even this, had I &s;taid there, would have done well enough; but as I rambl'd from them, and came there no more, the la&s;t Letters I had from any of them, was by my Partners means; who afterwards &s;ent another Sloop to the Place, and who &s;ent me word, tho' I had not the Letter till five Years after it was written; that they went on but poorly, were Male content with their long &s;tay there; That <HI>Will. Atkins</HI> was dead; That five of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were come away, and that tho' they had not been much mole&s;ted by the Savages, yet they had had &s;ome Skirmi&s;hes with them; That they begg'd of him to write to me, to think of the Promi&s;e I had made, to fetch 'em away, that they might &s;ee their own Country again before they dy'd.</P>
<P>But I was gone <HI>a Wild Goo&s;e Cha&s;e indeed;</HI> and They who will have any more of me, mu&s;t be content to follow me thro' a new Variety of Follies, Hard&s;hips, and Wild Adventures; wherein the Ju&s;tice of Providence may be duly ob&s;erved, and we may &s;ee how ea&s;ily Heaven can gorge us with our own De&s;ires; make the &s;tronge&s;t of our Wi&s;hes be our Affliction, and puni&s;h us mo&s;t &s;everely with tho&s;e very Things,

which we think, it would be our utmo&s;t Happi|ne&s;s to be allow'd in.</P>
<P>Let no wi&s;e Man flatter him&s;elf, with the Strength of his own Judgment, as if he was able to chu&s;e any particular Station of Life for him|&s;elf: Man, is a &s;hort &s;ighted Creature, &s;ees but a very little Way before him; and as his Pa&s;&s;ions, are none of his be&s;t Friends, &s;o his particular Affections, are generally his wor&s;t Coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>I &s;ay this, with Re&s;pect to the impetuous De|&s;ire I had from a Youth, to wander into the World; and how evident it now was, that this Principle was pre&s;erv'd in me for my Puni&s;hment: How it came on, the Manner, the Circum&s;tance, and the Conclu&s;ion of it, it is ea&s;ie to give you Hi|&s;torically, and with its utmo&s;t Variety of Particu|lars: But the &s;ecret Ends of Divine Power, in thus permitting us, to be hurry'd down the Stream of our own De&s;ires, is only to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e who can li&s;ten to the Voice of Providence, and draw religious Con&s;equences from God's Ju&s;tice, and their own Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Be it, I had Bu&s;ine&s;s, or no Bu&s;ine&s;s, away I went; 'tis no Time now to enlarge any far|ther upon the Rea&s;on, or Ab&s;urdity of my own Conduct; but to come to the Hi&s;tory, I was em|bark'd for the Voyage, and the Voyage I went.</P>
<P>I &s;hould only add here, that my Hone&s;t and tru|ly pious Clergyman left me here; a Ship being ready to go to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> he ask'd me leave to go thi|ther, being &s;till, as he ob&s;erv'd, bound never to fini&s;h any Voyage he began: How happy had it been for me, if I had gone with him!</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="228">
But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints are be&s;t; had I gone with him, I had never had had &s;o many things to be thank|ful for, and you had never heard of the &s;econd Part of the Travels and Adventures of <HI>Robin.

<P>From the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> we made directly away over the <HI>Atlantick Sea,</HI> to the <HI>Cape de bon E&s;perance,</HI> or as we call it, the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> and had a tolerable good Voyage, our Cour&s;e generally South-Ea&s;t; now and then a &s;torm, and &s;ome contrary Winds, but my Di&s;a&s;ters at Sea were at an end; my future Rubs and cro&s;s Events were to befal me on &s;hore; that it might appear the Land was as well prepar'd to be our &s;courge, as the Sea; when Heaven, who directs the Circum|&s;tances of Things, plea&s;es to appoint it to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> on board, who was to direct all her Motions after &s;he arrived at the <HI>Cape;</HI> only being limited to certain Numbers of Days, for &s;tay, by Charter party, at the &s;everal Ports &s;he was to go to: This was none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, neither did I meddle with it at all; my Nephew, the Captain, and the <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI> adju&s;ting all tho&s;e things between them, as they thought fit.</P>

<PB N="220" REF="229">
we were at War with <HI>France,</HI> I had &s;ome Appre|hen&s;ions of them; but they went their own Way, and we heard no more of them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pe&s;ter my Account, or the Reader, with De&s;criptions of Places, Journals of our Voy|ages, Variations of Compa&s;s, Latitudes, Meridian-Di&s;tances, Trade-Winds, Situation of Ports, and the like; &s;uch as almo&s;t all the Hi&s;tories of long Navigation are full of, and makes the reading tire&s;ome enough, and are perfectly unprofitable to all that read it, except only to tho&s;e, who are to go to tho&s;e Places them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is enough to name the Ports and Places, which we touch'd at, and what occurr'd to us upon our pa&s;&s;ing from one to another.

<P>We were obliged to &s;tay here &s;ome Time after we had furni&s;h'd our &s;elves with Provi&s;ions; and I, that was always too curious, to look into every Nook of the World where ever I came, was for going on Shore as often as I could, it was on the Ea&s;t Side of the I&s;land that we went on Shore, one Evening; and the People, who by the Way are very numerous, came thronging about us, and
<PB N="221" REF="230">
&s;tood gazing at us at a Di&s;tance; but as we had traded freely with them, and had been kindly u&s;ed, we thought our &s;elves in no Danger; but when we &s;aw the People, we cut three Boughs out of a Tree, and &s;tuck them up at a Di&s;tance from us, which it &s;eems, is a Mark in the Country, not only of Truce and Friend&s;hip, but when it is ac|cepted, the other Side &s;et up three Poles or Boughs, which is a Signal, that they accept the Truce too; but then, this is a known Condition of the Truce, that you are not to pa&s;s beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they to come pa&s;t your three Poles or Boughs, towards you; &s;o that you are perfectly &s;ecure within the three Poles, and all the Space betwen your Poles and theirs, is al|low'd like a Market, for free Conver&s;e, Traffick, and Commerce: When you go there, you mu&s;t not carry your Weapons with you; and if they come into that Space they &s;tick up their Javelines and Launces, all at the fir&s;t Poles, and come on unarm'd; but if any Violence is offer'd them, and the Truce thereby broken; away they run to the Poles, and lay hold of their Weapons, and then the Truce is at an End.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Evening when we went on Shore, that a greater Number of their People came down than u&s;ual, but all was very friendly and civil, and they brought in &s;everal Kinds of Provi&s;ions, for which we &s;atisfied them, with &s;uch Toys as we had; their Women al&s;o brought us Milk, and Roots, and &s;everal Things very ac|ceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made us a little Tent or Hut, of &s;ome Boughs of Trees, and lay on Shore all Night.</P>

I know not what was the Occa&s;ion, but I was not &s;o well &s;atisfied to lye on Shore as the re&s;t, and the Boat lying at an Anchor, about a Stone ca&s;t from the Land, with two Men in her to take care of her; I made one of them come on &s;hore, and getting &s;ome Boughs of Trees to cover us al&s;o in the Boat, I &s;pread the Sail on the Bottom of the Boat, and lay under the Cover of the Bran|ches of Trees all Night in the Boat.</P>
<P>About two a clock in the Morning, we heard one of our Men make a terrible Noi&s;e on the &s;hore, calling out for God's &s;ake, to bring the Boat in, and come and help them, for they were all like to be murther'd; at the &s;ame time, I heard the firing of 5 Muskets, which was the Num|ber of the Guns they had, and that, three times over; for it &s;eems, the Natives here were not &s;o ea&s;ily frighted with Guns, as the Savages were in <HI>America,</HI> where I had to do with them.</P>
<P>All this while, I knew not what was the mat|ter; but rouzing immediately from Sleep with the Noi&s;e, I caus'd the Boat to be thru&s;t in, and re&s;olv d, with three Fu&s;ils we had on board, to land, and a&s;&s;i&s;t our Men.</P>
<P>We got the Boat &s;oon to the Shore, but our Men were in too much ha&s;te: For being come to the &s;hore, they plunged into the Water to get to the Boat with-all the Expedition they could, being pur&s;ued by between three and four hun|dred Men: Our Men were but Nine in all, and only five of them had Fu&s;ils with them; the re&s;t had indeed Pi&s;tols and Swords, but they were of &s;mall u&s;e to them.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="232">
We took up &s;even of our Men, and with Dif|ficulty enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and that which was &s;till wor&s;e, was, that while we &s;tood in the Boat to take our Men in, we were in as much Danger as they were in on Shore; for they pour'd their Arrows in upon us &s;o thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side of the Boat up with the Benches, and two or three loo&s;e Boards, which to our great Satisfaction we had by mere Accident or Provi|dence in the Boat.</P>
<P>And yet, had it been Day-light, they are it &s;eems &s;ach exact Marks-men, that if they could have &s;een but the lea&s;t Part of any of us, they would have been &s;ure of us; we had by the Light of the Moon a little Sight of them, as they &s;tood pelting us from the Shore with Darts and Ar|rows; and having got ready our Fire-arms, we gave them a Volley, that we could hear by the Cries of &s;ome of them, that we had wounded &s;everal; however, they &s;tood thus in Battle Ar|ray on the Shore till break of Day, which we &s;uppo&s;e was, that they might &s;ee the better to take their Aim at us.</P>
<P>In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our Anchor or &s;et up our Sail, be|cau&s;e we mu&s;t needs &s;tand up in the Boat, and they were as &s;ure to hit us, as we were to hit a Bird in a Tree with &s;mall Shot; we made Signals of Di|&s;tre&s;s to the Ship, which, tho' we rode a League off, yet my Nephew the Captain hearing our firing, and by Gla&s;&s;es, perceiving the Po&s;ture we lay in, and that we fir'd towards the Shore, pretty well under&s;tood us; and weighing An|chor,
<PB N="224" REF="233">
with all &s;peed, he &s;tood as near the Shore as he dur&s;t with the Ship, and then &s;ent another Boat with ten Hands in her to a&s;&s;i&s;t us; but we call'd to them not to come too near, telling them what Condition we were in: However, they &s;tood in nearer to us; and one of the Men taking the End of a Tow-Line in his Hand, and keeping our Boat between him and the Enemy, &s;o that they could not perfectly &s;ee him, &s;wam on board us, and made fa&s;t the Line to the Boat; upon which we &s;lipp'd our little Cable, and leaving our Anchor behind, they tow'd us out of reach of the Arrows, we all the while lying clo&s;e behind the Barricado we had made.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were got from between the Ship and the Shore, that &s;he could lay her Side to the Shore, &s;he run along ju&s;t by them, and we pour'd in a Broad-&s;ide among them loaden with Pieces of Iron and Lead, &s;mall Bullets, and &s;uch &s;tuff, be&s;ides the great Shot, which made a terrible Ha|vock among&s;t them.</P>
<P>When we were got on board and out of Dan|ger, we had time to examine into the Occa&s;ion of this Fray; and indeed our <HI>Supra-Cargo</HI> who had been often in tho&s;e Parts, put me upon it; for he &s;aid, he was &s;ure the Inhabitants would not have touch'd us after we had made a Truce, if we had not done &s;omething to provoke them to it. At length it came out <HI>(viz.)</HI> that an Old Woman who had come to &s;ell us &s;ome Milk, had brought it within our Poles, with a young Wo|man with her, who al&s;o brought &s;ome Roots or Herbs; and while the Old Woman, whether &s;he was Mother to the young Woman or no, they could not tell, was &s;elling us the Milk, one
<PB N="225" REF="234">
of our Men offer'd &s;ome Rudene&s;s to the Wench that was with her, at which the old Woman made a great Noi&s;e: However, the Seaman would not quit his Prize, but carried her out of the old Woman's Sight among the Trees, it being almo&s;t dark; the old Woman went away without her, and as we &s;uppo&s;e, made an Out-cry among the People &s;he came from; who upon Notice, rais'd this great Army upon us in three or four Hours; and it was great odds, but we had been all de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>One of our Men was killed with a Launce thrown at him ju&s;t at the beginning of the At|tack, as he &s;ally'd out of the Tent they had made; the re&s;t came off free, all but the Fellow who was the Occa&s;ion of all the Mi&s;chief, who paid dear enough for his black Mi&s;tre&s;s; for we could not hear what became of him, a great while; we lay upon the Shore two Days after, tho' the Wind pre|&s;ented, and made Signals for him; made our Boat &s;ail up Shore and down Shore, &s;everal Leagues, but in vain; &s;o we were oblig'd to give him o|ver, and if he alone had &s;uffer'd for it, the Lo&s;s had been the le&s;s.</P>
<P>I could not &s;atisfie my &s;elf, however, without venturing on Shore once more, to try if I could learn any Thing of him or them; it was the third Night after the Action, that I had a great Mind to learn if I could by any Means what Mi&s;|chief we had done, and how the Game &s;tood on the <HI>Indians</HI> Side: I was careful to do it in the dark, le&s;t we &s;hould be attack'd again; but I ought indeed to have been &s;ure, that the Men I went with had been under my Command, be|fore I engag'd in a Thing &s;o hazardous and mi&s;|chievous
<PB N="226" REF="235">
as I was brought into by it, without my Knowledge or De&s;ign.</P>
<P>We took twenty &s;tout Fellows with us as any in the Ship, be&s;ides the Supra Cargo and my &s;elf, and we landed two Hours before Midnight, at the &s;ame Place where the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;tood drawn up the Evening before; I landed here, becau&s;e my De|&s;ign as I have &s;aid, was chiefly to &s;ee if they had quitted the Field, and if they had left any Marks behind them of the Mi&s;chief we had done them; and I thought, if we could &s;urprize one or two of them, perhaps we might get our Man again by Way of Exchange.</P>
<P>We landed without any Noi&s;e, and divided our Men into two Bodies, whereof, the Boat&s;wain commanded one, and I the other; we neither &s;aw or heard any Body &s;tir when we landed, and we march'd up one Body at a Di&s;tance from the other, to the Place, but at fir&s;t could &s;ee nothing it being very dark; till by and by, our Boat&s;wain that lead the fir&s;t Party, &s;tumbled and fell over a Dead Boy; this made them halt a while, for knowing by the Circum&s;tances that they were at the Place, where the <HI>Indians</HI> had &s;tood, they wait|ed for my coming up here; we concluded to halt till the Moon began to ri&s;e, which we knew would be in le&s;s than an Hour, when we could ea&s;ily di&s;cern the Havock we had made among them; we told two and thirty Bodies upon the Ground, whereof two were not quite dead: Some had an Arm, and &s;ome a Leg &s;hot off, and one his Head; tho&s;e that were wounded we &s;uppos'd, they had carried away.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="236">
When we had made, as I thought, a full Di&s;co|very of all we could come at the Knowledge of, I was re&s;olv'd for going on board; but the Boat&s;wain and his Party &s;ent me Word, that they were re&s;olv'd to make a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Indian</HI> Town, where the&s;e Dogs, as they call'd them, dwelt, and ask'd me to go along with them; and if they could find them, as &s;till they fan&s;i|ed they &s;hould, they did not doubt getting a good Booty, and it might be, they might find <HI>Tho. Jeffry</HI> there, <HI>that was the Man's Name we had lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Had they &s;ent to ask my Leave to go, I knew well enough what An&s;wer to have given them; for I would have commanded them in&s;tantly on Board, knowing it was not a Hazard fit for us to run, who had a Ship, and Ship-loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to make, which depend|ed very much upon the Lives of the Men; but as they &s;ent me Word they were re&s;olved to go, and only ask'd me and my Company to go along with them; I po&s;itively refus'd it, and ro&s;e up, <HI>for I was &s;itting on the Ground</HI> in Order to go to the Boat; one or two of the Men began to impor|tune me to go, and when I refus'd po&s;itively, began to grumble, and &s;ay they were not under my Command, and they would go: Come <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays one of the Men, will go with me? I'll go for one, <HI>Jack</HI> &s;aid he would, and another fol|lowed, and then another; and in a Word, they all left me but one, who I per&s;uaded to &s;tay, and a Boy left in the Boat; &s;o the Supra-Cargo and I, with the third Man, went back to the Boat, where we told them we would &s;tay for them, and take Care to take in as many of
<PB N="228" REF="237">
them as &s;hould be left; for I told 'em it was a mad Thing they were going about, and &s;up|po&s;ed mo&s;t of 'em would run the Fate of <HI>Thom. Jeffry.</HI></P>
<P>They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they would come off again, and they would take care, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So away they went; I entreated 'em to con&s;ider the Ship and Voyage; that their Lives were not their own, and that they were entru&s;ted with the Voyage in &s;ome mea&s;ure, that if they mi&s;|carry'd, the Ship might be lo&s;t for want of their Help, and that they could not an&s;wer it to God or Man. I &s;aid a great deal more to 'em on that Head, but I might as well have talk'd to the Main Ma&s;t of the Ship, they were mad upon their Journey, only they gave me good Words, and begg'd I would not be angry; That they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but they would be back again in an about an Hour at farthe&s;t; for the <HI>Indian</HI> Town they &s;aid, was not above half a Mile off, tho' they found it a|bove two Miles before they got to it.</P>
<P>Well, they all went away, as above; and tho' the Attempt was de&s;perate, and &s;uch, as none but mad Men would have gone about, yet to give 'em their due, they went about it warily as boldly: They were gallantly armed, that's true; for they had every Man a Fuzee or Mu&s;|ket, a Bayonet, every Man a Pi&s;tol; &s;ome of them had broad Cutla&s;&s;es, &s;ome of them Hangers, and the Boat&s;wain and Two more, had Pole-Axes: Be&s;ides all which, they had among them Thirteen Hand-Grenadoes. Bolder Fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked Work in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="238">
When they went out, their chief De&s;ign was Plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of find|ing Gold there; but a Circum&s;tance which none of them were aware of, &s;et them on fire with Revenge, and made Devils of them all. When they came to the few <HI>Indian</HI> Hou&s;es which they thought had been the Town, which was not a|bove half a Mile off; they were under a great Di&s;appointment; for there were not above 12 or 13 Hou&s;es; and where the Town was, or how big, they knew not: They con&s;ulted there|fore what to do, and were &s;ome time before they could re&s;olve: for if they fell upon the&s;e, they mu&s;t cut all their Throats, and it was ten to one but &s;ome of them might e&s;cape, it being in the Night, tho' the Moon was up; and if one e&s;ca|ped, he would run away, and rai&s;e all the Town, &s;o they &s;hould have a whole Army upon them: Again, on the other hand, if they went away, and left tho&s;e untouch'd (for the People were all a&s;leep) they could not tell which Way to look for the Town.</P>
<P>However, the la&s;t was the be&s;t Advice; &s;o they re&s;olved to leave them, and look for the Town as well as they could. They went on a little way, and found a Cow tied to a Tree; this they pre&s;ently concluded, would be a good Guide to them; for they &s;aid, the Cow certain|ly belonged to the Town before them, or the Town behind them; and if they untied her, they &s;hould &s;ee which way &s;he went; if &s;he went back, they had nothing to &s;ay to her; but if &s;he went forward, they had nothing to do but to follow her: So they cut the Cord, which was made of twi&s;ted Flags, and the Cow went on be|fore
<PB N="230" REF="239">
them; in a Word, the Cow led them di|rectly to the Town, which as they report, con|&s;i&s;ted of above 200 Hou&s;es, or Huts; and in &s;ome of the&s;e, they found &s;everal Families living toge|ther.</P>
<P>Here they found all in Silence, as profoundly &s;ecure, as Sleep, and a Country that had never &s;een an Enemy of that Kind could make them; and fir&s;t, they call'd another Council, to con&s;i|der what they had to do; and in a Word, they re&s;olv'd to divide them&s;elves into three Bodies, and to &s;et three Hou&s;es on Fire in three Parts of the Town; and as the Men came out, to &s;eize them and bind them; if any re&s;i&s;ted, they need not be ask'd what to do then, and &s;o to &s;earch the re&s;t of the Hou&s;es for Plunder; but they re|&s;olv'd to march &s;ilently fir&s;t, thro' the Town, and &s;ee what Dimen&s;ions it was of, and if they might venture upon it or no.</P>
<P>They did &s;o, and de&s;perately re&s;olv'd that they would venture upon them; but while they were animating one another to the Work, three of them that were a little before the re&s;t, call'd out aloud to them, and told them they had found <HI>Thom. Jeffry;</HI> they all run up to the Place, and &s;o it was indeed; for there they &s;ound the poor Fellow hang'd up naked by one Arm, and his Trhoat cut; there was an <HI>Indian</HI> Hou&s;e ju&s;t by the Tree, where they found &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen of the principal <HI>Indians</HI> who had been concern'd in the Fray with us before; and two or three of them wounded with our Shot; and our Men found they were awake, and talking one to another in that Hou&s;e, but knew not their Number.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="240">
The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade &s;o enrag'd 'em, as before, that they &s;wore to one another they would be reveng'd, and that not an <HI>Indian</HI> who came into their Hands &s;hould have Quarter, and to work they went immediately; and yet not &s;o madly as by the Rage and Fury they were in might be expected. Their fir&s;t Care was to get &s;omething that would &s;oon take Fire; but after a little &s;earch, they found that would be to no purpo&s;e; but mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es were low, and Thatch'd with Flags or Ru&s;hes, of which the Country is full; &s;o they pre&s;ently made &s;ome wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a little Pow|der in the Palms of their hands, and in a quarter of an Hour they &s;et the Town on fire in four or five Places; and particularly that Hou&s;e where the <HI>Indians</HI> were not gone to Bed. As &s;oon as the Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted Creatures began to ru&s;h out to &s;ave their Lives; but met with their Fate in the Attempt, and e&s;pecially at the Door, where they drove 'em back, the Boat&s;wain him&s;elf killing one or two with his Pole-Ax; The Hou&s;e being large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, but call'd for a Hand-Grenado, and threw it among 'em, which at fir&s;t frighted 'em; but when it bur&s;t, made &s;uch Havock among 'em, that they cried out in a hideous manner.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, mo&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> who were in the open Part of the Hou&s;e, were killed or hurt with the Grenado, except two or three more who pre&s;s'd to the Door, which the Boat&s;wain and two more kept with their Bayonets in the Muzzles of their Pieces, and di&s;patch'd all who came that Way. But there was another Apartment in the Hou&s;e where the Prince or King, or whatever he was ano &s;everal others were, and the&s;e they kept in till
<PB N="232" REF="241">
the Hou&s;e, which was by this time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them, and they were Imo|ther'd or burnt together.</P>
<P>All this while they fir'd not a Gun, becau&s;e they would not waken the People fa&s;ter than they could ma&s;ter them; but the Fire began to waken them fa&s;t enough, and our Fellows were glad to keep a little together in Bodies; for the Fire grew &s;o raging, all the Hou&s;es being made of light combu&s;tible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the Street between them, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to follow the Fire for the &s;urer Execution: As fa&s;t as the Fire either forc'd the People out of tho&s;e Hou&s;es which were burning, or frighted them out of others, our People were ready at their Doors to knock them on the Head, &s;till calling and hal|lowing to one another to remember <HI>Thom. Jeffrys.</HI></P>
<P>While this was doing, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was very unea&s;ie, and e&s;pecially when I &s;aw the Flames of the Town, which, it being Night, &s;eem'd to be ju&s;t by me.</P>
<P>My Nephew, the Captain, who was rouz'd by his Men too, &s;eeing &s;uch a Fire, was very unea&s;ie, not knowing what the Matter was, or what Dan|ger I was in; e&s;pecially hearing the Guns too; for by this time they began to u&s;e their Fire-Arms; a thou&s;and Thoughts oppre&s;t his Mind concern|ing me and the Supra-Cargo, what &s;hould become of us: And at la&s;t, tho' he could ill &s;pare any more Men, yet not knowing what Exigence we might be in, he takes another Boat, and with 13 Men and him&s;elf, comes on Shore to me.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="242">
He was &s;urpriz d to &s;ee me and the Supra-Cargo in the Boat with no more than two Men; and tho' he was glad that we were well, yet he was in the &s;ame Impatience with us to know what was doing; for the Noi&s;e continu'd and the Flame encreas'd: In &s;hort, it was next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility for any Men in the World, to re&s;train their Curio&s;ity, to know what had happen'd, or the Concern for the Safety of the Men: In a word, the Captain told me, he would go and help his Men, let what would come. I argu'd with him as I did before with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, the Danger of the Voyage, the Intere&s;t of the Owners and Merchants, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> and told him, I would go and the two Men, and only &s;ee if we could at a Di&s;tance learn what was like to be the Event, and come back and tell him.</P>
<P>It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to talk to the re&s;t before; he would go he &s;aid, and he only wi&s;h'd he had left but Ten Men in the Ship; for he could not think of having his Men lo&s;t for want of Help, he had rather lo&s;e the Ship, the Voyage, and his Life and all; and a|way went he.</P>
<P>In a Word, I was no more able to &s;tay behind now, than I was to per&s;uade them not to go; &s;o in &s;hort, the Captain order'd two Men to row back the Pinnace, and fetch twelve Men more, leaving the Long-Boat at an Anchor, and that when they came back, &s;ix Men &s;hould keep the two Boats, and &s;ix more come after us; &s;o that he left only 16 Men in the Ship; for the whole Ship's Company con&s;i&s;ted of 65 Men, where|of
<PB N="234" REF="243">
two were lo&s;t in the la&s;t Quarrel, which brought this Mi&s;chief on.</P>
<P>Being now on the March, you may be &s;ure we felt little of the Ground we trode on; and being guided by the Fire, we kept no Path, but went directly to the Place of the Flame: If the Noi&s;e of the Guns was &s;urprizing to us before, the Cries of the poor People were now of quite another na|ture, and fill'd us with Horror. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never was at the &s;acking a City, or at the taking a Town by &s;torm. I had heard of <HI>Oliver Crom|well</HI> taking <HI>Drogheda</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and killing Man, Woman and Child: And I had read of Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> &s;acking of the City of <HI>Magdeburgh,</HI> and cut|ting the Throats of 22000 of all Sexes: But I ne|ner had an Idea of the Thing it&s;elf before, not is it po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe it, or the Horror which was upon our Minds at hearing it.</P>
<P>However, we went on, and at length came to the Town, tho' there was no entring the Streets of it for the Fire. The fir&s;t Object we met with, was the Ruins of a Hut or Hou&s;e, or rather the A&s;hes of it, for the Hou&s;e was con&s;um'd; and ju&s;t before it, plain now to be &s;een by the Light of the Fire, lay four Men and three Women kill'd; and as we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap a|mong the Fire. In &s;hort there were &s;uch In&s;tances of a Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fury, &s;emething beyond what was human, that we thought it impo&s;&s;ible our Men could be guilty of it, or if they were the Authors of it, we thought they ought to be every one of 'em put to the wor&s;t of Deaths. But this was not all, we &s;aw the Fire encreas'd forward, and the Cry went on ju&s;t as the Fire went on; &s;o that we were in the
<PB N="235" REF="244">
utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion. We advanc'd a little Way far|ther, and behold, to our A&s;toni&s;hment, three Women naked, and crying in a mo&s;t dreadful Man|ner, come flying, as if they had indeed had Wings, and after them &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Men, Natives, in the &s;ame Terror and Con&s;ternation, with three of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Butchers, for I can call them no bet|ter, in their Rear, who, when they could not overtake them, fir'd in among them, and one that was kill'd by their Shot fell down in our Sight; when the re&s;t &s;aw us, believing us to be their Enemies, and that we would murther them as well as tho&s;e that per&s;ued them, they &s;et up a mo&s;t dreadful Shreik, e&s;pecially the Women; and two of them fell down as if already dead with the Fright.</P>
<P>My very Soul &s;hrunk within me, and my Blood run chil in my Veins, when I &s;aw this; and I be|lieve, had the three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors that pur&s;u'd them come on, I had made our Men kill them all: However we took &s;ome Ways to let the poor fly|ing Creatures know, that we would not hurt them, and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with their Hands lifted up, made piteous Lamentation to us to &s;ave them, which we let them know we would; whereupon they crept altogether in a Huddle cro&s;e behind us, as for Pro|tection. I left my Men drawn up together, and charg'd them to hurt no Body, but if po&s;&s;ible to get at &s;ome of our People, and &s;ee what Devil it was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them, and what they intended to do; and in a word, to command them off; a&s;&s;uring them, that if they &s;tay'd till Day-light, they would have an hundred thou&s;and Men about their Ears: I &s;ay, I left them, and went among tho&s;e flying People, taking only two of our Men with me;
<PB N="236" REF="245">
and there was indeed a piteous Spectacle among them: Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt with trampling and running thro' the Fire, others their Hands burnt; one of the Women had fallen down in the Fire, and was very much burnt before &s;he could get out again, and two or three of the Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs from our Men pur&s;uing; and another was &s;hot thro' the Body, and died while I was there.</P>
<P>I would fain have learned what the Occa&s;ion of all this was, but I could not under&s;tand one Word they &s;aid; tho' by Signs I perceived that &s;ome of them knew not what was the Occa&s;ion them&s;elves. I was &s;o terrified in my Thoughts at this outragious Attempt, that I could not &s;tay there; but went back to my own Men, and re|&s;olved to go into the Middle of the Town thro' the Fire, or whatever might be in the Way, and put an End to it, co&s;t what it would: Accordingly, as &s;oon as I came back to my Men, I told them my Re&s;olution, and commanded them to follow me, when in the very Moment came four of our Men with the Boat&s;wain at their Head, roving over the Heaps of Bodies they had killed, all co|ver'd with Blood and Du&s;t, as if they wanted more People to ma&s;&s;acre, when our Men hallow'd to them as loud as they could hallow, and with much ado one of them made them hear; &s;o that they knew who we were, and came up to us.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Boat&s;wain &s;aw us, he &s;et up a Hallow like a Shout of Triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come, and without bear|ing to hear me, Captain, &s;ays he, noble Captain, I am glad you are come; we have not half done yet, villainous Hell hound Dogs, I'll kill as many of
<PB N="237" REF="246">
them as poor <HI>Tom.</HI> has Hairs upon his Head. We have &s;worn to &s;pare none of them, we'll root out the very Nation of 'em from the Earth, and thus he run on, out of Breath too with Action, and would not give us leave to &s;peak a Word.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, rai&s;ing my Voice, that I might &s;ilence him a little, Barbarous Dog, &s;aid I, what are you doing? I won't have one Creature touch'd more, upon pain of Death. I charge you upon your Life, to &s;top your Hands, and &s;tand &s;till here, or you are a dead Man this minute.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, &s;ays he, Do you know what you do, or what they have done? If you want a Rea&s;on for what we have done, come hither; and with that he &s;hew'd me the poor Fellow hanging with his Throat cut.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I was urged then my&s;elf, and at ano|ther time &s;hould have been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their Rage too far, and thought of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Words to his Sons <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi; Cur&s;ed be their Anger, for it was fierce; and their Wrath, for it was cruel:</HI> But I had now a a new Task upon my hands; for when the Men I carried with me &s;aw the Sight as I had done, I had as much to do to re&s;train them, as I &s;hould have had with the other; nay, my Nephew him|&s;e f fell in with them, and told me in their hearing that he was only concerned for fear of the Men be|ing overpower'd; for as to the People, he thought not one of 'em ought to live; for they had all glutted them&s;elves with the Murther of the poor Man, and that they ought to be u&s;ed like Mur|therers. Upon the&s;e Words, away run eight of my Men with the Boat&s;wain and his Crew, to
<PB N="238" REF="247">
compleat their bloody Work; and I &s;eeing it quite out of my Power to re&s;train them, came away pen&s;ive and &s;ad; for I could not bear the Sight, much le&s;s the horrible Noi&s;e and Cries of the poor Wretches that fell into their Hands.</P>
<P>I got no Body to come back with me but the Supra-Cargo and two Men; and with the&s;e I walk'd back to the Boats. It was a very great Piece of Folly in me, I confe&s;s, to venture back, as it were alone; for as it began now to be al|mo&s;t Day, and the Alarm had run over the Coun|try, there &s;tood about 40 Men arm'd with Laun|ces and Bows at the little Place where the 12 or 13 Hou&s;es &s;tood mention'd before; but by Accident I mi&s;s'd the Place, and came directly to the Sea-&s;ide, and by the time I got to the Sea-&s;ide it was broad Day; immediately I took the Pinnace, and went aboard, and &s;ent her back to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Men in what might happen.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd about the Time that I came to the Boat-&s;ide, that the Fire was pretty well out, and the Noi&s;e abated; but in about half an Hour af|ter I got on Board, I heard a Volley of our Mens Fire-arms, and &s;aw a great Smoak; this, as I un|der&s;tood afterwards, was our Men falling upon the Men, who as I &s;aid &s;tood at the few Hou&s;es on the Way, of whom they kill'd &s;ixteen or &s;even|teen, and &s;et all tho&s;e Hou&s;es on Fire, but did not meddle with the Women or Children.</P>
<P>By that Time the Men got to the Shore a|gain with the Pinnace, our Men began to appear; they came dropping in, &s;ome and &s;ome, not in two Bodies, and in Form as they went, but all in Heaps, &s;traggling here, and there, in &s;uch a Man|ner,
<PB N="239" REF="248">
that a &s;mall Force of re&s;olute Men might have cut them all off.</P>
<P>But the Dread of them was upon the whole Country; and the Men were amaz'd, and &s;urpriz'd, and &s;o frighted, that I believe a hundred of 'em would have fled at the Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in all this terrible Action was there a Man who made any con&s;iderable Defence, they were &s;o &s;urpriz'd between the Terror of the Fire, and the &s;udden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that they knew not which Way to turn them|&s;elves; for if they fled one Way, they were met by one Party; if back again, by another: So that they were every where knock'd down: Nor did any of our Men receive the lea&s;t hurt; ex|cept one who &s;train'd his Foot, and another had one of his Hands very much burnt.</P>
<P>I was very angry with my Nephew the Cap|tain, and indeed with all the Men in my Mind, but with him in particular; as well for his acting &s;o out of his Duty as Commander of the Ship, and having the Charge of the Voyage upon him, as in his prompting rather than cooling the Rage of his Men in &s;o bloody and cruel an Enterprize. My Nephew an&s;wer'd me very re&s;pectfully; but told me, that when he &s;aw the Body of the poor Seaman, whom they had murther'd in &s;uch a cruel and bar|barous manner, he was not Ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, neither could he govern his Pa&s;&s;ion. He own'd, he &s;hould not have done &s;o, as he was Comman|der of the Ship; but as he was a Man, and Na|ture mov'd him, he could not bear it. As for the re&s;t of the Men, they were not &s;ubject to me at all, and they knew it well enough; &s;o they took no notice of my Di&s;like.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="249">
The next Day we &s;et &s;ail, &s;o we never heard any more of it: Our Men differ'd in the Account of the Number they kill'd: Some &s;aid one Thing, &s;ome another; but according to the be&s;t of their Accounts put altogether, they kill'd or de&s;troy'd about 150 People, Men, Women and Children, and left not a Hou&s;e &s;tanding in the Town.</P>
<P>As for the poor Fellow <HI>Tho. Jeffrys,</HI> as he was quite dead, for his Throat was &s;o cut, that his Head was half off, it would do him no Service to bring him away, &s;o they left him where they found him, only took him down from the Tree where he was hang'd by one Hand.</P>
<P>However ju&s;t our Men thought this Action, I was again&s;t them in it; and I always, after that Time, told them, God would bla&s;t the Voyage; for I look'd upon all the Blood they &s;hed that Night to be Murther in them: For tho' it is true, that they had kill'd <HI>Tho. Jeffrys,</HI> yet it was as true that <HI>Jeffrys</HI> was the Aggre&s;&s;or, had broken the Truce, and had violated or debauch'd a young Woman of theirs who came down to them innocently; and on the Faith of their publick Capitulation.</P>
<P>The Boat&s;wain defended this Quarrel when we were afterwards on board: He &s;aid, It is true that we &s;eem'd to break the Truce, but really had not, and that the War was begun the Night before by the Natives them&s;elves, who had &s;hot us, and kill'd one of our Men without any ju&s;t Provocation; &s;o that as we were in a Capacity to fight them now, we might al&s;o be in a Capacity to do our &s;elves Ju&s;tice upon them in an extraor|dinary
<PB N="241" REF="250">
Manner, that tho' the poor Man had taken a little Liberty with a Wench, he ought not to have been murther'd, and that in &s;uch a villanous Man|ner: and that they did nothing but what was ju&s;t, and what the Laws of God allow'd to be done to Murtherers.</P>
<P>One would think this &s;hould have been enough to have warn'd us again&s;t going on Shore among Heathens and Barbarians: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to make Mankind wi&s;e, but at their own Expence and their Experience &s;eems to be always of mo&s;t U&s;e to them, when it is deare&s;t bought.</P>
<P>We are now bound to the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and from thence to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coremandel,</HI> only to touch at <HI>Surrat:</HI> But the chief of the Supra-Car|go's De&s;ign lay at the Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> where if he mi&s;s'd of his Bu&s;ine&s;s outward bound, he was to go up to <HI>China,</HI> and return to the Coa&s;t as he came Home.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Di&s;a&s;ter that befel us, was in the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where five of our Men venturing on Shore on the <HI>Arabian</HI> Side of the Gulph, were &s;urrounded by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and either all kill'd or carry'd away into Slavery; the re&s;t of the Boat's Crew were not able to re&s;cue them, and had but ju&s;t Time to get off their Boat. I began to up|braid them with the ju&s;t Retribution of Heaven in this Ca&s;e: But the Boat&s;wain very warmly told me, he thought I went farther in my Cen&s;ures than I could &s;hew any Warrant for in Scripture, and referr'd to the 13 St. <HI>Luke,</HI> Ver&s;e 4th. where our Saviour intimates, that tho&s;e Men, on whom the Tower of <HI>Siloam</HI> fell, were not Sinners above all the <HI>Galileans:</HI> But that which indeed put me to
<PB N="242" REF="251">
Silence in the Ca&s;e, was, That not one of the&s;e five Men, who were now lo&s;t, were of the Num|ber of tho&s;e who went on Shore to the Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Madaga&s;car; (&s;o I always call'd it, tho' our Men could not bear the Word</HI> Ma&s;&s;acre <HI>with any Patience:)</HI> And indeed, this la&s;t Circum&s;tance, as I have &s;aid, put me to Silence for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But my frequent preaching to them on this Subject had wor&s;e Con&s;equences than I expected; and the Boat&s;wain, who had been the Head of the Attempt, came up boldly to me one Time, and told me, he found, that I continually brought that Affair upon the Stage, that I made unju&s;t Re|flections upon it, and had u&s;ed the Men very ill on that Account, and him&s;elf in particular; that as I was but a Pa&s;&s;enger, and had no Command in the Ship, or Concern in the Voyage, they were not oblig'd to bear it; that they did not know, but I might have &s;ome ill De&s;ign in my Head, and perhaps to call them to Account for it, when they came to <HI>England;</HI> and that therefore, unle&s;s I would re&s;olve to have done with it; and al&s;o, not to concern my &s;elf any farther with him, or any of his Affairs, he would leave the Ship; for he did not think it was &s;afe to &s;ail with me among them.</P>
<P>I heard him patiently enough 'till he had done, and then told him, that I did confe&s;s I had all a|long oppos'd the <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre of Madaga&s;car,</HI> for &s;uch I would always call it; and that I had on all Occa|&s;ions &s;poken my Mind freely about it, tho' not more upon him than any of the re&s;t: That as to my having no Command in the Ship, that was true; nor did I exerci&s;e any Authority, only took my Liberty of &s;peaking my Mind in Things which
<PB N="243" REF="252">
publickly concern'd us all; and what Concern I had in the Voyage was none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; that I was a con&s;iderable Owner of the Ship; and in that Claim I conceived I had a Right to &s;peak e|ven farther than I had yet done, and would not be accountable to him or any one el&s;e, and begun to be a little warm with him: He made but little Reply to me at that Time, and I thought that Affair had been over. We were at this Time in the Road at <HI>Bengale,</HI> and being willing to &s;ee the Place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo in the Ship's Boat, to divert my&s;elf, and towards E|vening was preparing to go on Board, when one of the Men came to me, and told me, he would not have me trouble my &s;elf to come down to the Boat, for they had Orders not to carry me on Board any more. Any one may gue&s;s what a Sur|prized was in at &s;o in&s;olent a Me&s;&s;age; and I ask'd the Man, who bad him deliver that Errand to me? He told me, the Cock&s;wain. I &s;aid no more to the Fellow, but bad him let them know he had deliver'd his Me&s;&s;age, and that I had given him no An&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>I immediately went and found out the Supra-Cargo, and told him the Story, adding what I pre&s;ently fore&s;aw, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That there would cer|tainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, and entreated him to go immediately on Board the Ship in an <HI>Indian</HI> Boat, and acquaint the Captain of it: But I might ha'&s;par'd this Intelligence; for before I had &s;poken to him on Shore, the Matter was effected on Board. The Boat&s;wain, the Gunner, the Carpenter; and in a Word, all the Inferiour Officers, as &s;oon as I was gone off in the Boat, came up to the Quar|ter-Deck, and de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with the Captain, and there the Boat&s;wain making a long Harangue
<PB N="244" REF="253">
for the Fellow talk'd very well, and repeating all he had &s;aid to me, told the Captain in few Words, That as I was now gone peaceaby on Shore, they were loth to u&s;e any Violence with me; which, if I had not gone on Shore, they would otherwi&s;e have done, to oblige me to have gone: They there|fore thought fit to tell him, That as they &s;hipp'd them&s;elves to &s;erve in the Ship under his Com|mand, they would perform it well and faithfully: But if I would not quit the Ship, or the Captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the Ship, and &s;ail no farther with him; and at that Word, ALL, he turn'd his Face about towards the Main-ma&s;t, which was it &s;eems the Signal a|greed on between them; at which, all the Sea|men being got together, they cry'd out, <HI>One</HI> and ALL, <HI>One</HI> and ALL.</P>
<P>My Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spi|rit, and of great Pre&s;ence of Mind; and tho' he was &s;urpriz'd, you may be &s;ure, at the Thing, yet he told them calmly, that he would con&s;ider of the Thing, but that he could do nothing in it 'till he had &s;poken to me about it. He us'd &s;ome Ar|guments with them, to &s;hew them the Unrea&s;on|ablene&s;s and Inju&s;tice of the Thing: But it was all in vain, they &s;wore and &s;hook Hands round before his Face, that they would go all on Shore, unle&s;s he would engage to them, not to &s;uffer me to come any more on Board the Ship.</P>
<P>This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his Obligation to me, and did not know how I might take it; &s;o he began to talk cavalierly to them, told them that I was a very con&s;iderable Owner of the Ship, and that in Ju&s;tice he could not put me out of my own Hou&s;e; that this was next Door to
<PB N="245" REF="254">
&s;erving me, as the famous Pirate <HI>Kid</HI> had done, who made the Mutiny in a Ship, &s;et the Captain on Shore in an uninhabited I&s;land, and run away with the Ship; that let them go into what Ship they would, if ever they came to <HI>England</HI> again, it would co&s;t them dear; that the Ship was mine, and that he could not put me out of it; and that he would rather lo&s;e the Ship and the Voyage too, than di&s;oblige me &s;o much; &s;o they might do as they pleas'd: However, he would go on Shore, and talk with me on Shore, and invited the Boat|&s;wain to go with me, and perhaps they might ac|commodate the Matter with me.</P>
<P>But they all rejected the Propo&s;al, and &s;aid, they would have nothing to do with me any more, nei|ther on Board, or on Shore; and if I came on Board, they would all go on Shore. Well, &s;aid the Cap|tain, if you are all of this Mind, let me go on Shore and talk with him; &s;o away he came to me with this Account, a little after the Me&s;|&s;age had been brought to me from the Cock|&s;wain.</P>
<P>I was very glad to &s;ee my Nephew, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s; for I was not without Apprehen&s;ions, that they would confine him by Violence, &s;et &s;ail, and run away with the Ship, and then I had been &s;tripp'd naked in a remote Country, and nothing to help my&s;elf: In &s;hort, I had been in a wor&s;e Ca&s;e, than when I was all alone in the I&s;land.</P>
<P>But they had not come that length, it &s;eems, to my great &s;atisfaction; and when my Nephew told me what they had &s;aid to him, and how they had &s;worn, and &s;hook Hands, that they would <HI>one</HI> and <HI>all</HI> leave the Ship, if I was &s;uffer'd to come on
<PB N="246" REF="255">
Board, I told him, he &s;hould not be concern'd at it at all, for I would &s;tay on Shore. I only de&s;ir'd he would take Care and &s;end me all my nece&s;&s;ary Things on Shore, and leave me a &s;ufficient Sum of Money, and I would find my Way to <HI>England,</HI> as well as I could.</P>
<P>This was a heavy Piece of News to my Ne|phew; but there was no Way to help it, but to comply with it: So, in &s;hort, he went on Board the Ship again, and &s;atisfy'd the Men, that his Uncle had yielded to their Importunity, and had &s;ent for his Goods from on Board the Ship; &s;o that Matter was over in a very few Hours, the Men return'd to their Duty, and I began to con&s;i|der what Cour&s;e I &s;hould &s;teer.</P>
<P>I was now alone in the remote&s;t Part of the World, <HI>as I think I may call it;</HI> for I was near three thou&s;and Leagues by Sea farther off from <HI>England,</HI> than I was at my I&s;land; only it is true, I might travel here by Land over the Great Mogul's Country to <HI>Surratte,</HI> might go from thence to <HI>Ba|fora</HI> by Sea, up the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and from thence might take the Way of the Caravans over the De&s;ert of <HI>Arabia</HI> to <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Scanderoon;</HI> from thence by Sea again to <HI>Italy,</HI> and &s;o over Land in|to <HI>France,</HI> and this put together might be, at lea&s;t, a full Diameter of the Globe; but if it were to be mea&s;ur'd, I &s;uppo&s;e it would appear to be a great deal more.</P>
<P>I had another Way before me, which was to wait for &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, which were coming to <HI>Bengale</HI> from <HI>Achin</HI> on the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and get Pa&s;&s;age on Board them for <HI>England:</HI> But as I came hither without any Concern with the
<PB N="247" REF="256">
<HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, &s;o it would be diffi|cult to go from hence without their Licen&s;e, unle&s;s with great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or of the Companies Factors, and to both, I was an utter Stranger.</P>
<P>Here I had the particular Plea&s;ure, &s;peaking by Contraries, to &s;ee the Ship &s;et &s;ail without me, a Treatment I think a Man in my Circum&s;tances &s;carce ever met with, except from Pirates run|ning away with a Ship, and &s;etting tho&s;e that would not agree with their Villany, on Shore: indeed this was next Door to it, both Ways; how|ever, my Nephew left me two Servants, or ra|ther one Companion, and one Servant, the fir&s;t was Clerk to the Pur&s;er, who he engag'd to go with me, and the other was his own Servant; I took me al&s;o a good Lodging in the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman, where &s;everal Merchants lodg'd; &s;ome <HI>French</HI> two <HI>Italians,</HI> or rather <HI>Jews</HI> and one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man: Here I was hand&s;omely enough entertain'd; and that I might not be &s;aid to run ra&s;hly upon any Thing, I &s;tay'd hereabove nine Months, con&s;idering what Cour&s;e to take, and how to manage my &s;elf, I had &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods with me of Value, and a con&s;iderable Sum of Money, my Nephew furni&s;hing me with a thou&s;and Pieces of Eight, and a Letter of Cre|dit for more, if I had Occa&s;ion, that I might not be &s;traiten'd whatever might happen.</P>
<P>I quickly di&s;pos'd of my Goods, and to Advan|tage too; and, as I originally intended, I bought here &s;ome very good Diamonds, which, of all other Things, was the mo&s;t proper for me in my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, becau&s;e I might always carry my whole E&s;tate about me.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="257">
After a long Stay here, and many Propo&s;als made for my Return to <HI>England,</HI> but none falling out to my Mind, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant who lod|ged with me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate Acquaintance, came to me one Mor|ning: Country-man, &s;ays he, I have a Project to communicate to you, which, as it &s;uits with my Thoughts, may for ought I know, &s;uit with your's al&s;o, when you &s;hall have thoroughly con|&s;ider'd it.</P>
<P>Here we are po&s;ted, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you by Accident, and I by my own Choice, in a Part of the World very remote from our own Country; but it is in a Country, where, by us who under&s;tand Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, a great deal of Money is to be got: If you will put a thou&s;and Pound to my thou&s;and Pound, we will hire a Ship here, the fir&s;t we can get to our Minds; you &s;hall be Captain, I'll be Merchant, and we will go a trading Voyage to <HI>China;</HI> for what &s;hould we &s;tand &s;till for?

<P>I lik'd his Propo&s;al very well, and the more, becau&s;e it &s;eem'd to be expre&s;s'd with &s;o much good Will, and in &s;o friendly a Manner: I will not &s;ay, but that I might by my loo&s;e and unhing'd Circum&s;tances be the fitter to embrace a Propo&s;al for Trade, or indeed for any Thing el&s;e; whereas, otherwi&s;e, Trade was none of my Element: However, I might perhaps &s;ay with &s;ome Truth, that if Trade was not my Element,

Rambling was, and no Propo&s;al for &s;eeing any Part of the World which I had never &s;een before, could po&s;&s;ibly come ami&s;s to me.</P>
<P>It was however, &s;ome Time before we could get a Ship to our Minds; and when we had got a Ve&s;&s;el, it was not ea&s;y to get <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors; that is to &s;ay, &s;o many as were nece&s;&s;ary to go|vern the Voyage, and manage the Sailors which we &s;hould pick up there: After &s;ome Time we got a Mate, a Boat&s;wain, and a Gunner <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Carpenter, and three <HI>Portugueze</HI> Fore|ma&s;t Men; with the&s;e we found, we could do well enough, having <HI>Indian</HI> Sea-men, &s;uch as they are, to make up.</P>
<P>There are &s;o many Travellers, who have wrote the Hi&s;tory of their Voyages and Travels this Way, that it would be very little Diver&s;ion to any Body, to give a long Account of the Places we went to, and the People who inhabit there; tho&s;e Things I leave to others, and refer the Reader to tho&s;e Journals and Travels of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, of which, many I find are publi&s;h'd, and more promis'd every Day; 'tis enough to me to tell you, That I made this Voyage to <HI>Achin,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Siam,</HI> where we exchang'd &s;ome of our Wares for Opi|um, and &s;ome Arrack, the fir&s;t, a Commodity which bears a great Price among the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and which at that Time, was very much wanted there; in a Word, we went up to <HI>Suskan,</HI> made a very great Voyage; was eight Months out, and return'd to <HI>Bengale,</HI> and I was very well &s;atisfy'd with my Adventure: I ob&s;erve that our People in <HI>England,</HI> often admire how the Officers which the Company &s;end into <HI>India,</HI> and the Merchants which generally &s;tay

<P>But it is no Wonder, or at lea&s;t we &s;hall &s;ee &s;o much farther into it, when we con&s;ider the innumerable Ports and Places where they have a free Commerce; that it will then be no Won|der; and much le&s;s will it be &s;o, when we con&s;i|der, that at all tho&s;e Places and Ports where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships come, there is &s;o much, and &s;uch con&s;tant Demand for the Growth of all o|ther Countries, that there is a certain Vent for the Returns, as well as a Market abroad, for the Goods carried out.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we made a very good Voyage, and I got &s;o much Money by the fir&s;t Adventure, and &s;uch an In&s;ight into the Method of getting more, that had I been twenty Year younger, I &s;hould have been tempted to have &s;taid here and &s;ought no farther, for making my Fortune; but what was all this, to a Man on the wrong Side of three&s;core, that was rich enough, and came a|broad, more in Obedience to a re&s;tle&s;s De&s;ire of &s;eeing the World, than a covetuous De&s;ire of get|ting in it; and indeed I think, 'tis with great Ju|&s;tice, that I now call it a re&s;tle&s;s De&s;ire for it was &s;o; when I was at Home, I was re&s;tle&s;s to go abroad; and now I was abroad, I was re&s;tle&s;s to be at Home: I &s;ay, what was this Gain to me? I was rich enough, nor had I any unea&s;ie De&s;ires about getting more Money and therefore, the Profit of the Voyage to me, were Things of no great Force, for the prompting me forward to farther Undertakings; and I thought that by this Voyage, I had made no Progre&s;s at all, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="251" REF="260">
I was come back as I might call it, to the Place from whence I came as to a Home; where|as, my Eye, which like that, which <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;peaks of, <HI>was never &s;atisfied with Seeing,</HI> was &s;till more de|&s;irous of Wand'ring and Seeing; I was come into a Part of the World, which I was never in before; and that Part in particular, which I had heard much of; and was re&s;olv'd to &s;ee as much of as I could, and then I thought, I might &s;ay, I had &s;een all the World, that was worth &s;ee|ing.</P>
<P>But my Fellow Traveller and I, had different Notions; I do not name this, to in&s;i&s;t upon my own, for I acknowledge his were the mo&s;t ju&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;uited to the end of a Merchant's Life; who, when he is abroad upon Adven|tures, 'tis his Wi&s;dom to &s;tick to that as the be&s;t Thing for him, which he is like to get the mo&s;t Money by: My new Friend kept him&s;elf to the Nature of the Thing, and would have been con|tent to have gone like a Carrier's Hor&s;e, always to the &s;ame Inn, backward and forward, provi|vided he could, as he call'd it, <HI>find his Account in it;</HI> on the other Hand, mine was the Notion of a mad rambling Boy, that never cares to &s;ee a Thing twice over.</P>
<P>But this was not all; I had a Kind of Impati|ence upon me to be nearer Home, and yet, the mo&s;t un&s;ettled Re&s;olution imaginable which Way to go; in the Interval of the&s;e Con&s;ultati|ons, my Friend, who was always upon the Search for Bu&s;ine&s;s, propos'd another Voyage to me among the Spice I&s;lands, and to bring Home a Loading of Cloves from the <HI>Manillas,</HI> or there abouts; Places where indeed the <HI>Dutch</HI> do trade,
<PB N="252" REF="261">
but I&s;lands, belonging partly to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> tho' we went not &s;o far, but to &s;ome other, where they have not the whole Power as they have at <HI>Batavia, Ceylon,</HI> &amp;c. we were not long in prepa|ring for this Voyage; the chief Difficulty was in bringing me to come into it; however, at la&s;t no|thing el&s;e offering, and finding that really &s;tirring about and trading, the Profit being &s;o great, and as I may &s;ay certain, had more Plea&s;ure in it, and more Satisfaction to the Mind than &s;itting &s;till, which to me e&s;pecially, was the unhappie&s;t Part of Life: I re&s;olv'd on his Voyage too, which we made very &s;ucce&s;sfully, touching at <HI>Borneo,</HI> and &s;e|veral I&s;lands, who&s;e Names I do not remember, and came Home in about five Months; we &s;old our Spice, which was chiefly Cloves, and &s;ome Nutmegs, to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchants, who carried them away for the Gulph; and making near five of one, we really got a great deal of Money.</P>
<P>My Friend, when we made up this Account &s;mil'd at me; well now, &s;aid he, with a Sort of a|greeable in&s;ulting my indolent Temper; is not this better than walking about here, like a Man <HI>of nothing to do,</HI> and &s;pending our Time in &s;taring at the Non&s;en&s;e and Ignorance of the Pagans? Why truly, &s;ays I, my Friend, I think it is; and I begin to be a Convert to the Principles of Mer|chandizing; but I mu&s;t tell you, &s;aid I, by the Way, you do not know what I am a doing, for if once I conquer, my backwardne&s;s, and embark heartily; as old as I am, I &s;hall harra&s;s you up and down the World, till I tire you; for I &s;hall pur&s;ue it &s;o eagerly, I &s;hall never let you lye &s;till.</P>
<P>But to be &s;hort with my Speculations, a little while after this, there came in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship from
<PB N="253" REF="262">
<HI>Batavia;</HI> &s;he was a Coa&s;ter, not an <HI>European</HI> Tra|der, and of about two hundred Ton Burthen: The Men, as they pretended having been &s;o &s;ickly, that the Captain had not Men enough to go to Sea with; he lay by at <HI>Bengal,</HI> and hav|ing it &s;eems got Money enough, or being willing for other Rea&s;ons, to go for <HI>Europe,</HI> he gave pub|lick Notice, that he would &s;ell his Ship: This came to my Ears before my new Partner heard of it; and I had a great Mind to buy it, &s;o I goes Home to him, and told him of it; he con&s;idered a while, for he was no ra&s;h Man neither; but mu&s;ing &s;ome Time, he reply'd, &s;he is a little too big; but however, we will have her; according|ly we bought the Ship, and agreeing with the Ma&s;ter, we paid for her, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; when we had done &s;o, we re&s;olved to entertain the Men if we could, to join them with tho&s;e we had, for the pur&s;uing our Bu&s;ine&s;s; but on a &s;ud|den, they having receiv'd not their Wages, but their &s;hare of the Money, not one of them was to be found; we enquir'd much about them, and at length were told, that they were all gone to|gether by Land to <HI>Agra,</HI> the great City of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Re&s;idence; and from thence were to travel to <HI>Suratte,</HI> and &s;o by Sea, to the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing had &s;o heartily troubled me a good while; as that I mi&s;s'd the Opportunity of going with them; for &s;uch a Ramble I thought, and in &s;uch Company, as would both have guarded me and diverted me, would have &s;uited mighti|ly with my great De&s;ign; and I &s;hould both have &s;een the World, and gone homewards too; but I was much better &s;atisfied a few Days after, when I came to know what &s;ort of Fellows they were;
<PB N="254" REF="263">
for in &s;hort, their Hi&s;tory was, that this Man they call'd Captain was the Gunner only, not the Commander; that they had been a trading Voyage, in which, they were attack'd on Shore, by &s;ome of the <HI>Mallayans,</HI> who had kill'd the Captain, and three of his Men; and that after the Captain was kill'd, the&s;e Men Eleven in Number, had re&s;olv'd to run away with the Ship, which they did; and brought her in at the Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> leaving the Mate and five Men more on Shore, of whom, we &s;hall hear farther.</P>
<P>Well, let them come by the Ship how they would, we came hone&s;tly by her, <HI>as we thought,</HI> tho' we did not I confe&s;s, examine into Things &s;o exactly as we ought, for we never enquir'd any Thing of the Seamen; who, if we had examin'd, would certainly have falter'd in their Account, contradicted one another, and perhaps contradi|cted them&s;elves, or one how or other, we &s;hould have &s;een Rea&s;on to have &s;u&s;pected them; but the Man &s;hew'd us a Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one <HI>Emanuel Clo&s;ter&s;hoven,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch Name; for I &s;uppo&s;e it was all a Forgery, and call'd him&s;elf by that Name, and we could not contradict him; and being withal, a little too unwary, or at lea&s;t, ha|ving no Su&s;picion of the Thing, we went thro' with our Bargain.</P>
<P>We pick'd up &s;ome more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen here after this, and &s;ome <HI>Dutch;</HI> and now we re&s;ol|ved for a &s;econd Voyage, to the South Ea&s;t for Cloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that is to &s;ay, among the <HI>Philippine</HI> and <HI>Mollucco</HI> I&s;les; and in &s;hort, not to fill this Part of my Story with Trifles, when what is yet to come, is &s;o remarkable; I &s;pent from fir&s;t to la&s;t &s;ix Years in this Country, trading from Port to
<PB N="255" REF="264">
Port, backward and forward, and with very good Succe&s;s; and was now the la&s;t Year with my new Partner, going in the Ship above-mention'd, on a Voyage to <HI>China;</HI> but de&s;igning fir&s;t to <HI>Siam,</HI> to buy Rice.</P>
<P>In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds ob|lig'd to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of <HI>Mallacca,</HI> and among the I&s;lands; we were no &s;ooner got clear of tho&s;e difficult Seas, but we found our Ship had &s;prung a Leak, and we were not able by all our Indu&s;try to find it out where it was: This forc'd us to make for &s;ome Port, and my Partner who knew the Country better than I did, directed the Cap|tain to put into the River of <HI>Cambodia, far I had made the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Mate, one Mr.</HI> Thom&s;on, <HI>Captain, not being willing to take the Charge of two Ship upon my &s;elf:</HI> This River lies on the North Side of the great Bay or Gulph, which goes up to <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>While we were here, and going often on Shore for Refre&s;hment, there comes to me one Day an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, and he was it &s;eems a Gunner's Mate, on board an <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ship, which rode in the &s;ame River, up at, or near the Ci|ty of <HI>Cambodia;</HI> what brought him hither we know not; but he comes up to me, and &s;peak|ing <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> Sir, &s;ays he, you are a Stranger to me, and I to you; but I have &s;omething to tell you, that very nearly concerns you.</P>
<P>I look'd &s;teadily at him a good while, and thought at fir&s;t I had known him, but I did not; if it very nearly concerns me, &s;aid I, and not; your &s;elf, what moves you to tell it me? I am moved &s;ays he, by the eminent Danger you are
<PB N="256" REF="265">
in, and for ought I &s;ee, you have no Knowledge of it; I know no Danger I am in, &s;aid I, but that my Ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I purpo&s;e to lay her a-Ground to Morrow, to &s;ee if I can find it; but Sir, &s;ays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it, or not find it, you will be wi&s;er than to lay your Ship on Shore to Morrow, when you hear what I have to &s;ay to you; do you know Sir, &s;aid he, the Town of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> lyes about fifteen Leagues up this River? and there are two large <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships about five Leagues on this Side, and three <HI>Dutch;</HI> well <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and what is that to me? Why Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> is it for a Man that is up|on &s;uch Adventures as you are upon, to come into a Port, and not examine fir&s;t what Ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal with them? I &s;uppo&s;e you don't think you are a Match for them: I was amu&s;ed very much at his Di&s;cour&s;e, but not amaz'd at it, for I could not conceive what he meant; and I turn'd &s;hort upon him and &s;aid, Sir, I wi&s;h you would ex|plain your &s;elf; I cannot imagine what Rea&s;on I have to be afraid of any Company of Ships, or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships; I am no Interloper, what can they have to &s;ay to me?</P>
<P>He look'd like a Man half angry, half pleas'd, and pau&s;ing a while, but &s;miling; well Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you think your &s;elf &s;ecure, you mu&s;t take your Chance; I am &s;orry your hate &s;hould blind you again&s;t good Advice; but a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, if you do not put to Sea immediately, you will the very next Tide be attack'd by five Long-Boats full of Men, and perhaps if you are taken, you'll be hang'd for a Pirate, and the Particulars be examin'd afterwards: I thought Sir, added he, I &s;hould have met with a better Reception than
<PB N="257" REF="266">
this, for doing you a Piece of Service of &s;uch Im|portance: I can never be ungrateful, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> for any Service, or to any Man that offers me any Kindne&s;s, but it is pa&s;t my Comprehen&s;ion &s;aid I, what they &s;hould have &s;uch a De&s;ign upon me for, however, <HI>&s;ince you &s;ay,</HI> there is no Time to be lo&s;t, and that there is &s;ome villainous De&s;ign in Hand again&s;t me; I'll go on board this Minute, and put to Sea immediately, If my Men can &s;top the leak, or if we can &s;wim without &s;topping it? But, Sir, &s;aid I, &s;hall I go away ignorant of the Rea&s;on of all this? Can you give me no farther Light into it?</P>
<P>I can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, &s;ays he, but I have a <HI>Dutch</HI> Seaman here with me and I believe I could per&s;uade him to tell you the re&s;t; but there is &s;carce time for it. But the &s;hort of the Story is this, the fir&s;t Part of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, you know well enough, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that you was with this Ship at <HI>Sumatra,</HI> that there your Captain was murther'd by the <HI>Mal|layans,</HI> with three of his Men, and that you or &s;ome of tho&s;e who were on board with you, ran a|way with the Ship, and are &s;ince turn'd <HI>PIRATES;</HI> this is the Sum of the Story, and you will be all &s;eiz'd as Pirates I can a&s;&s;ure you, and executed, with very little Ceremony; for you know; Merchants Ships &s;hew but little Law to <HI>Pirates,</HI> if they get them into their Power.</P>
<P>Now you &s;peak plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;aid I, and I thank you; and tho' I know nothing, that we have done, like what you talk of, but am &s;ure we came hone&s;t|ly and fairly by the Ship, yet &s;eeing &s;uch Work is a doing as you &s;ay, and that you &s;eem to mean hone&s;t|ly, I'll be upon my guard; nay, Sir, &s;ays he, do not
<PB N="258" REF="267">
talk of being upon your guard; the be&s;t Defence, is to be out of the Danger, if you have any Regard to your Life, and the Life of all your Men; put out to Sea without fail at High Water, and as you have a whole Tide before you, you will be gone too far out before they can come down, for they came away at High Water; and as they have twenty Miles to come, you get near two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide, not reckoning the length of the Way; be&s;ides, as they are only Boats, and not Ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to Sea, e&s;pe|cially if it blows.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you have been very kind in this, what &s;hall I do for you, to make you amends? Sir, &s;ays he, you may not be &s;o willing to make me any amends, becau&s;e you may not be convinc'd of the Truth of it: I'll make an offer to you; I have nineteen Months Pay due to me, on board the Ship &mdash; &mdash; which I came out of <HI>England</HI> in, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man that is with me, has &s;even Months Pay due to him; if you will make good our Pay to us, we will go along with you; if you find nothing more in it, we will de&s;ire no more; but if we do convince you, that we have &s;av'd your Lives, and the Ship, and the Lives of all the Men in her, we will leave the re&s;t to you.</P>
<P>I con&s;ented to this readily, and went immedi|ately on board, and the two Men with me; as &s;oon as I came to the Ship Side, my Partner who was on board, came out on the Quarter-Deck, and call'd to me with a great deal of Joy, <HI>O ho! O oh! we have &s;topp'd the leak! we have &s;topp'd the leak!</HI> Say you &s;o, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> thank God; but weigh the Anchor then immediately; weigh! <HI>Says he:</HI>
<PB N="259" REF="268">
What do you mean by that? What is the Matter, <HI>&s;ays he?</HI> Ask no Que&s;tions, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but all Hands to work, and <HI>weigh,</HI> without lo&s;ing a Minute; he was &s;urpriz'd, but however, he call'd the Captain, and he immediately order'd the Anchor to be got up; and tho' the Tide was not quite done, yet a little Land Breeze blowing, we &s;tood out to Sea; then I call'd him into the Cabin and told him the Story at large, and we call'd in the Men, and they told us the re&s;t of it; but as it took us up a great deal of Time, &s;o be|fore we had done, a Sea-man comes to the Cabin Door, and calls out to us, that the Captain bad him tell us, we were chas'd, chas'd, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> by who, and by what? By five Sloops or Boats, &s;ays the Fellow, full of Men; very well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> then it is apparent there is &s;omething in it; in the next Place I order'd all our Men to be call'd up, and told them, that there was a De&s;ign to &s;eize the Ship, and to take us for Pirates, and ask'd them, if they would &s;tand by us, and by one another; the Men an&s;wer'd chearfully, that one and all, they would live and die with us: Then I asked the Captain, what Way he thought be&s;t for us to manage a Fight with them; for re&s;i&s;t them I was re&s;olved we would, and that, to the la&s;t Drop; he &s;aid readily, That the Way was to keep them off with our great Shot, as long as we could, and then to fire at them with our &s;mall Arms as long as we could; but when neither of the&s;e would do any longer, we &s;hould retire to our clo&s;e Quarters; perhaps they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-Heads, or get in upon us.</P>
<P>The Gunner had in the mean Time, Order to bring two Guns to bear fore and aft out of
<PB N="260" REF="269">
the Steerage, to clear the Deck, and loaded them with Mu&s;quet-Bullets and &s;mall Pieces of old Iron, and what next came to Hand, and thus we made ready for Fight; but all this while we kept out to Sea, with Wind enough; and could &s;ee the Boats at a Di&s;tance, being five large <HI>Long-Boats,</HI> following us with all the &s;ail they could make.</P>
<P>Two of tho&s;e Boats, which by our Gla&s;&s;es we could &s;ee were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> out &s;ailed the re&s;t, were near two Leagues a Head of them, and gain'd upon us con&s;iderably; &s;o that we found they would come up with us; upon which, we fired Gun without Ball, to intimate, that they &s;hould bring too, and we put out a Flag of Truce; as a Signal for Parley, but they kept crowding after us, till they came within Shot: When we took in our White Flag, they having made no An&s;wer to it, hung out a red Flag, and fired at them with a Shot: Notwith&s;tanding this, they came on, till they were near enough to call to them with a &s;peaking Trumpet, which we had on Board; &s;o we call'd to them, and bid them keep off at their Peril.</P>
<P>It was all one, they crowded after us, and en|deavoured to come under our Stern, &s;o to board us on our Quarter; upon which, &s;eeing they were re&s;olute for Mi&s;chief, and depended upon the &s;trength that followed them, I ordered to bring the Ship too, &s;o that they lay upon our Broad-&s;ide, when immediately we fir'd five Guns at them; one of which, had been levelled &s;o true, as to carry away the Stern of the hindermo&s;t Boat, and bring them to the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking down their Sail, and running all to the Head of the Boat to keepl er
<PB N="261" REF="270">
from &s;inking; &s;o &s;he lay by, and had enough of it; but &s;eeing the foremo&s;t Boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in par|ticular.</P>
<P>While this was doing, one of the three Boats that was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made up to the Boat which we had di&s;abled, to relieve her, and we could afterwards &s;ee her take out the Men; we call'd again to the fore|mo&s;t Boat, and offer'd a Truce to parley again, and to know what was her Bu&s;ine&s;s with us; but had no An&s;wer, only &s;he crowded clo&s;e under our Stern; upon this our Gunner, who was a ve|ry dexterous Fellow, run out his two Cha&s;e-Guns and fired again at her; but the &s;hot mi&s;&s;ing, the Men in the Boat &s;houted, wav'd their Caps, and came on; but the Gunner getting quickly ready again, fir'd among them the &s;econd Time; one Shot of which, tho' it mi&s;s'd the Boat it &s;elf, yet fell in among the Men, and we could ea&s;ily &s;ee, had done a great deal of Mi&s;chief among them; but we taking no Notice of that, war'd the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to bear upon them; and firing three Guns more, we found the Boat was &s;plit almo&s;t to Pieces; in particular, her Rudder, and a Piece of her Stern was &s;hot quite away, &s;o they handed their Sail immediately, and were in great Di&s;|order; but to compleat their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns at them again; where he hit them we could not tell, but we found the Boat was &s;inking, and &s;ome of the Men already in the Water; upon this, I immediately man'd out our Pinnace, which we had kept clo&s;e by our Side, with Orders to pick up &s;ome of the Men if they could, and &s;ave them from drown|ing,
<PB N="262" REF="271">
and immediately to come on board with them; becau&s;e we &s;aw the re&s;t of the Boats began to come up; our Men in the Pinnace followed their Or|ders, and took up three Men; one of which was ju&s;t drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover him; as &s;oon as they were on Board, we crouded all the Sail we could make, and &s;tood farther out to Sea, and we found that when the other three Boats came up to the fir&s;t two, they gave over their Chace.</P>
<P>Being thus deliver'd from a Danger, which tho' I knew not the Rea&s;on of it, yet &s;eem'd to be much greater than I apprehended; I took Care that we would change our Cour&s;e, and not let any one imagine whither we were going; &s;o we &s;tood out to Sea Ea&s;tward, quite out of the Cour&s;e of all <HI>Europian</HI> Ships, whether they were bound to <HI>China,</HI> or any where el&s;e, within the Commerce of the <HI>Europian</HI> Nations.</P>
<P>When we were now at Sea, we began to con|&s;ult with the two Seamen, and enquire fir&s;t what the meaning of all this &s;hould be, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man let us into the &s;ecret of it at once; telling us that the Fellow that &s;old us the Ship, <HI>as we &s;aid,</HI> was no more than a Thief, that had run away with her: Then he told us, how the Captain, who&s;e Name too he told us, tho' I do not remem|ber, was treacherou&s;ly murthered by the Na|tives on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mallaca,</HI> with three of his Men, and that he, this <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, and four more, got into the Woods, where they wandered about a great while; till at length, he in particu|lar, in a miraculous manner made his E&s;cape, and &s;wam off to a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, which &s;ailing near the Shore, in its Way from <HI>China,</HI> had &s;ent their Boat
<PB N="263" REF="272">
on Shore for fre&s;h Water; that he dur&s;t not come to that Part of the Shore where the Boat was, but &s;hift in the Night, to take the Water farther off, and the Ship's Boat took him up.</P>
<P>He then told us, that he went to <HI>Battavia,</HI> where two of the Sea-men belonging to the Ship arriv'd, having de&s;erted the re&s;t in their Travels, and gave an Account that the Fellow who had run a|way with the Ship, &s;old her at <HI>Bengale,</HI> to a Set of Pirates, which were gone a Crui&s;ing in her; and that they had already taken an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship and two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships very richly laden.</P>
<P>This later Part we found to concern us direct|ly, and tho' we knew it to be fal&s;e; yet as my Part|ner &s;aid very well, if we had fallen into their Hands, and they had had &s;uch a Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended our &s;elves, or to hope for any good Quarter at their Hands, and e&s;pecially con&s;idering that our Accu&s;ers had been our Judges, and that we could have expected nothing from them, but what Rage would have dictated, and an ungo|verned Pa&s;&s;ion have executed; and therefore it was his Opinion, we &s;hould go directly back to <HI>Bengale,</HI> from whence we came, without putting in at any Port whatever; becau&s;e there, we could give a good Account of our &s;elves, could prove where we were when the Ship put in, who we bought her of, and the like; and which was more than all the re&s;t, if we were put to the Nece&s;&s;ity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we &s;hould be &s;ure to have &s;ome Ju&s;tice, and not be hang'd fir&s;t, and judg'd afterward.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="273">
I was &s;ometime of my Partner's Opinion; but after a little more &s;erious thinking, I told him, I thought it was a very great Hazard for us to at|tempt returning to <HI>Bengale,</HI> for that we were on the wrong &s;ide of the Straits of <HI>Malacca;</HI> and that if the Alarm was given, we &s;hould be &s;ure to be Way-laid on every &s;ide, as well by the <HI>Dutch</HI> of <HI>Battavia,</HI> as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> el&s;e-where; that if we &s;hould be taken, as it were, running away, we &s;hould even condemn our &s;elves, and there would want no more Evidence to de&s;troy us; I al&s;o asked the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailor's Opinion, who &s;aid, he was of my Mind, and that we &s;hould certainly be taken.</P>
<P>This Danger, a little &s;tartled my Partner and all the Ship's Company; and we immediately re|&s;olved to go away to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> and &s;o on to the Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI> and pur&s;uing the fir&s;t De&s;ign as to Trade, find &s;ome Way or other to di&s;po&s;e of the Ship, and come back in &s;ome of the Ve&s;&s;els of the Country, &s;uch as we could get: This was approved of as the be&s;t Method for our Security; and accordingly we &s;teered away N.N.E. keeping above fifty Leagues off from the u&s;ual Cour&s;e to the Ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>This however put us to &s;ome Inconveniences; for fir&s;t the Winds, when we came to the Di&s;tance from the Shore, &s;eem'd to be more &s;teadily again&s;t us, blowing almo&s;t Trade, <HI>as we call it,</HI> from the Ea&s;t, and E.N.E. &s;o that we were a long while upon our Voyage, and we were but ill provided with Victuals for &s;o long a Voyage; and which was &s;till wor&s;e, there was &s;ome Danger that tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, who&s;e Boats pur&s;ued us, whereof &s;ome were bound that Way, might be got in before us, and if not, &s;ome other Ship, bound to
<PB N="265" REF="274">
<HI>China,</HI> might have Information of us from them, and pur&s;ue us with the &s;ame Vigour.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was now very unea&s;y, and thought my&s;elf, including the late E&s;cape from the Long-Boats, to have been in the mo&s;t dange|rous Condition that ever I was in thro' all my pa&s;t Life; for whatever ill Circum&s;tances I had been in, I was never pur&s;u'd for a Thief before; nor had I ever done any Thing that merited the Name of Di&s;hone&s;t or Fraudulent, much le&s;s Thievi&s;h. I had chiefly been my own Enemy, or as I may rightly &s;ay, I had been no Body's Enemy but my own: But now I was embarra&s;s'd in the wor&s;t Con|dition imaginable; for tho' I was perfectly inno|cent, I was in no Condition to make that Inno|cence appear: And if I had been taken, it had been under a &s;uppo&s;ed Guilt of the wor&s;t Kind; at lea&s;t, a Crime e&s;teem'd &s;o among the People I had to do with.</P>
<P>This made me very anxious to make an E&s;cape, tho', which Way to do it, I knew not, or what Port or Place we &s;hould go to: My Partner &s;eeing me thus dejected, tho' he was the mo&s;t concern'd at fir&s;t, began to encourage me; and di&s;cribing to me the &s;everal Ports of that Coa&s;t, told me he would put in on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chochinchina,</HI> or the Bay of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> intending to go afterwards to <HI>Macao,</HI> a Town once in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI> and where &s;till a great many <HI>European</HI> Fa|milies re&s;ided, and particularly the mi&s;&s;ionary Prie&s;ts u&s;ually went thither, in order to their go|ing forward to <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Hither then we re&s;olv'd to go; and according|ly, tho' after a tedious and irregular Cour&s;e, and
<PB N="266" REF="275">
very much &s;traitned for Provi&s;ions, we came with|in Sight of the Coa&s;t very early in the Morning; and upon Reflection upon the pa&s;t Circum&s;tances we were in, and the Danger if we had not e|&s;caped, we re&s;olv'd to put into a &s;mall River, which however had a Depth enough of Water for us, and to &s;ee if we could, either over Land, or by the Ship's Pinnace, come to know what Ships were in any Port thereabouts. This happy Step, was indeed our Deliverance; for tho' we did not immediately &s;ee any <HI>Europian</HI> Ships in the Bay of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> yet the next Morning there came into the Bay two <HI>Dutch Ships,</HI> and a third with|out any Colours &s;pread out, but which we believ'd to be a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man pa&s;s'd by at about two Leagues Di&s;tance, &s;teering for the Coa&s;t of <HI>China;</HI> and in the Afternoon went by two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships &s;teering the &s;ame Cour&s;e; and thus, we thought, we &s;aw our &s;elves be&s;et with Enemies, both one Way or other. The Place we were in was wild and bar|barous, the People Thieves, even by Occupation or Profe&s;&s;ion; and tho' it is true we had not much to &s;eek of them, and except getting a few Provi|&s;ions, car'd not how little we had to do with them, yet it was with much Difficulty that we kept our &s;elves from being in&s;ulted by them &s;eve|ral Ways.</P>
<P>We were in a &s;mall River of this Country, with|in a few Leagues of its utmo&s;t Limits North|ward; and by our Boat we coa&s;ted Noth-Ea&s;t to the Point of Land, which opens the great Bay of <HI>Tonquin;</HI> and it was in this beating up along the Shore, that we di&s;cover'd, as above, that in a Word, we were &s;urrounded with Enemies. The People we were among, were the mo&s;t barbarous of all the Inhabitants of the Coa&s;t; having no Cor|re&s;pondence
<PB N="267" REF="276">
with any other Nation, and dealing only in Fi&s;h, and Oil, and &s;uch gro&s;s Commodities; and it may be particularly &s;een, that they are, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> the mo&s;t barbarous of any of the Inha|bitants, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that among other Cu&s;toms they have this as one, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That if any Ve&s;&s;el have the Misfortune to be &s;hipwreck'd upon their Coa&s;t, they pre&s;ently make their Men all Pri&s;oners or Slaves; and it was not long before we found a &s;pice of their Kindne&s;s this Way, on the Occa&s;ion following.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved above, that our Ship &s;prung a Leak at Sea, and that we could not find it out; and however, it happen'd, that as I have &s;aid it was &s;topp'd unexpectedly in the happy Minute of our being to be &s;eiz'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships in the Bay of <HI>Siam;</HI> yet as we did not find the Ship &s;o perfectly fit and &s;ound as we de&s;ir'd, we re&s;olv'd, while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore, take out what heavy Things we had on Board, which were not many, and to wa&s;h and clean her Bottom, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to find out where the Leaks were.</P>
<P>Accordingly, having lighten'd the Ship, and brought all our Guns and other moveable Things to one &s;ide, we try'd to bring her down, that we might come at her Bottom; but on &s;econd Thoughts we did not care to lay her dry on Ground, neither could we find out a proper Place for it.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants, who had never been acquain|ted with &s;uch a &s;ight, came wondering down to the Shore, to look at us; and &s;eeing the Ship lie down on one &s;ide in &s;uch a manner, and heeling in towards the Shore; and not &s;eeing our Men,
<PB N="268" REF="277">
who were at Work on her Bottom, with Stages and with their Boats on the off-&s;ide, they pre&s;ent|ly concluded, that the Ship was ca&s;t away, and lay &s;o fa&s;t on the Ground.</P>
<P>On this Suppo&s;ition they came all about us in two or three Hours time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having &s;ome of them eight, &s;ome ten Men in a Boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on Board, and plunder'd the Ship; and if they had found us there, to have carry'd us away for Slaves to their King, or whatever they call him; for we knew nothing who was their Go|vernour.</P>
<P>When they came up to the Ship, and began to row round her, they di&s;cover'd us all hard at Work on the Out-&s;ide of the Ships bottom and &s;ide, wa&s;hing, and graving, and &s;topping, as eve|ry &s;eafaring Man knows how.</P>
<P>They &s;tood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a little &s;urpriz'd, could not imagine what their De&s;ign was; but, being <HI>willing to be &s;ure,</HI> we took this Opportunity to get &s;ome of us into the Ship, and others to hand down Arms and Ammunition to tho&s;e that were at Work, to defend them&s;elves with, if there &s;hould be Occa|&s;ion; and it was no more than Need; for in le&s;s than a quarter of an Hour's Con&s;ultation, they agreed, it &s;eems, that the Ship was really a Wreck, that we were all at Work endeavouring to &s;ave her, or to &s;ave our Lives by the Help of our Boats, and when we handed our Arms into the Boats, they concluded, by that Motion, that we were endeavouring to &s;ave &s;ome of our Goods; upon this they took it for granted we all belong'd to
<PB N="269" REF="278">
them; and away they came down upon our Men, as if it had been in a Line of Battle.</P>
<P>Our Men, &s;eeing &s;o many of them, began to be frighted; for we lay but in an ill Po&s;ture to fight, and cry'd out to us to know what they &s;hould do: I immediately call'd to the Men who work'd upon the Stages, to &s;lip them down, and get up the &s;ide into the Ship; and bad tho&s;e in the Boat to row round and come on Board; and tho&s;e few of us, who were on Board, work'd with all the &s;trength and hands we had, to bring the Ship to Rights; but however, neither the Men upon the Stages or tho&s;e in the Boats, could do as they were order'd, before the <HI>Cochinchine&s;&s;es</HI> were upon them; and two of their Boats boarded our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold of the Men as their Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Man they laid hold of was an <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>-Seaman, a &s;tout &s;trong Fellow, who having a Musket in his Hand, never offer'd to fire it, but laid it down in the Boat, <HI>like a Fool, as I thought:</HI> But he under&s;tood his Bu&s;ine&s;s better than I could teach him; for he grappled the Pagan, and dragg'd him by main Force, out of their own Boat into ours; where, taking him by the two Ears, he beat his Head, &s;o again&s;t the Boat's Gunnel, that the Fellow dy'd in&s;tantly in his Hands; and in the mean time, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, who &s;tood next, took up the Musket, and with the But-end of it, &s;o laid about him, that he knock'd down five of them, who attempted to enter the Boat; But this was doing little towards re&s;i&s;ting thirty or fourty Men, who fearle&s;s, becau&s;e ignorant of their Dan|ger, began to throw them&s;elves into the Long-Boat, where we had but five Men in all to defend it:
<PB N="270" REF="279">
But one Accident gave our Men a compleat Victo|ry, which de&s;erv'd our Laughter rather than any Thing el&s;e, and that was this:</P>
<P>Our Carpenter being preparing to grave the Out-&s;ide of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where he had caulk'd her to &s;top the Leakes, had got two Kettles ju&s;t let down into the Boat; one fill'd with boiling Pitch, and the other with Ro|&s;in, Tallow, and Oil, and &s;uch Stuff, as the Ship-Wrights u&s;e for that Work; and the Man that tended the Carpenter, had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, with which he &s;upply'd the Men that were at Work with that hot Stuff; two of the E|nemies Men entred the Boat ju&s;t where this Fel|low &s;tood, being in the Fore-&s;heets; he imme|diately &s;aluted them with a Ladle full of the Stuff, boiling hot, which &s;o burnt and &s;calded them, being half naked, that they roar'd out like two Bulls, and, enrag'd with the Fire, leap'd both into the Sea: The Carpenter &s;aw it, and cry'd out, Well done, <HI>Jack,</HI> give them &s;ome more of it; and &s;tepping forward him&s;elf, takes one of their Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot, he and his Man threw it among them &s;o plentifully that, in &s;hort, of all the Men in three Boats, there was not one that was not &s;calded, and burnt with it in a mo&s;t frightful pitiful Manner, and made &s;uch a Howling and Crying, that I never heard a wor&s;e Noi&s;e, and indeed nothing like it; for it is worth ob&s;erving, That tho' Pain natural|ly makes all People cry out, yet every Nation has a particular Way of Exclamation, and make Noi|&s;es as different from one another, as their Speech; I cannot give the Noi&s;e, the&s;e Creatures made, a better Name than Howling, nor a Name more proper to the Tone of it; for I never heard any
<PB N="271" REF="280">
Thing more like the Noi&s;e of the Wolves, which as I have &s;aid, I heard howl in the Fore&s;t on the Frontiers of <HI>Languedoc.</HI></P>
<P>I was never pleas'd with a Victory better in my Life; not only as it was a perfect Surprize to me, and that our Danger was imminent before: But as we got this Victory without any Blood &s;hed, except of that Man the Fellow kill'd with his naked Hands, and which I was very much con|cern'd at; for I was &s;ick of killing &s;uch poor Sa|vage Wretches, even tho' it was in my own De|fence, knowing they came on Errands which they thought ju&s;t, and knew no better; and that tho' it may be a ju&s;t Thing, becau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, for there is no nece&s;&s;ary Wickedne&s;s in Nature, yet I thought it was a &s;ad Life, which we mu&s;t be always oblig'd to be killing our Fellow-Creatures to pre&s;erve our own, and indeed I think &s;o &s;till; and I would even now &s;uffer a great deal, rather than I would take away the Life, even of that Per&s;on injuring me: And I believe, all con&s;idering People, who know the Value of Life, would be of my opinion, at lea&s;t, they would, if they entred &s;eriou&s;ly into the Con|&s;ideration of it.</P>
<P>But to return to my Story, all the while this was doing, my Partner and I, who manag'd the re&s;t of the Men on Board, had with great Dexte|rity brought the Ship almo&s;t to Rights; and ha|ving gotten the Guns into their Places again, the Gunner call'd to me to bid our Boat get out of the Way, for he would let fly among them. I call'd back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the Carpenter would do the Work without him, but bad him heat another Pitch-Kettle, which our Cook, who was on Board, took Care of: But
<PB N="272" REF="281">
the Enemy were &s;o terrify'd with what they had met with in their fir&s;t Attack, that they would not come on again; and &s;ome of them that were farthe&s;t off, &s;eeing the Ship &s;wim, as it were up|right, begun, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, to &s;ee their Mi|&s;take, and give over the Enterprize, finding it was not as they expected: Thus we got clear of this merry Fight; and having gotten &s;ome Rice, and &s;ome Roots, and Bread, with about &s;ixteen good big Hogs on Board, two Days before, we re|&s;olv'd to &s;tay here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it; for we made no Doubt but we &s;hould be &s;urrounded the next Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch-Kettle would di&s;po&s;e of for us.</P>
<P>We therefore got all our Things on Board the &s;ame Evening, and the next Morning was ready to &s;ail; in the mean time, lying at an Anchor at &s;ome Di|&s;tance, we were not &s;o much concern'd, being now in a &s;ighting Po&s;ture, as well as in a &s;ailing Po&s;ture, if any Enemy had pre&s;ented: The next Day ha|ving fini&s;h'd our Work within Board, and finding our Ship was perfectly heal'd of all her Leaks, we &s;et &s;ail; we would have gone into the Bay of <HI>Tonquin;</HI> for we wanted to inform our &s;elves of what was to be known concerning the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that had been there; but we dur&s;t not &s;tand in there, becau&s;e we had &s;een &s;everal Ships go in, as we &s;uppos'd, but a little before; &s;o we kept on N.E. towards the I&s;le of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> as much afraid of being &s;een by a <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant Ship, as a <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant Ship in the <HI>Mediteranean</HI> is of an <HI>Algerine</HI> Man of War.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="282">
When we were thus got to Sea, we kept out N.E. as if we would go to the <HI>Munillas</HI> or the <HI>Phillip|pine</HI> I&s;lands; and this we did, that we might not fall into the Way of any of our <HI>European</HI> Ships; and then we &s;teer'd North 'till we came to the Lati|tude of 22 Degrees, 30 Min.; by which Means we made the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> directly, where we came to an Anchor, in order to get Water and fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, which the People there, who are very courteous and civil in their Manners, &s;upply'd us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctu|ally with us in all their Agreements and Bar|gains; which is what we did not find among other People; and may be owing to the Re|mains of Chri&s;tianity, which was once planted here by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary of Prote&s;tants, and is a Te&s;timony of what I have often ob&s;erv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Chri&s;tian Religion always civili|zes the People, and reforms their Manners, where it is receiv'd, whether it works &s;aving Effects upon them or no.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;ail'd &s;till North, keeping the Coa&s;t of <HI>China</HI> at an equal Di&s;tance, till we knew we were beyond all the Ports of <HI>China,</HI> where our <HI>European</HI> Ships u&s;ually come; being re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, not to fall into any of their Hands, e&s;pecially in this Country, where, as our Cir|cum&s;tances were, we could not fail of being en|tirely ruin'd; nay, &s;o great was my Fear in par|ticular, as to my being taken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much rather have cho|&s;en to fall into the Hands of the <HI>Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we re&s;olv'd to put into the fir&s;t trading Port we
<PB N="274" REF="283">
&s;hould come at; and &s;tanding in for the Shore, a Boat came off two Leagues to us, with an old <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilot on Board, who knowing us to be an <HI>European</HI> Ship, came to offer his Service, which indeed we were very glad of, and took him on Board; upon which, without asking us whether we would go, he di&s;mi&s;s'd the Boat he came in, and &s;ent them back.</P>
<P>I thought it was now &s;o much in our Choice, to make the old Man carry us whither we would; that I began to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulph of <HI>Nanquin,</HI> which is the mo&s;t Northern Part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>China:</HI> The old Man &s;aid he knew the Gulph of <HI>Nanquin</HI> very well; but &s;miling, ask'd us what we would do there?</P>
<P>I told him, we would &s;ell our Cargo, and pur|cha&s;e <HI>China</HI>-Wares, Callicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, Wrought-Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o would return by the &s;ame Cour&s;e we came: He told us our be&s;t Port had been to have put in at <HI>Macao,</HI> where we could not have fail'd of a Market for our Opium, to our Satisfaction, and might for our Money have purchas'd all Sorts of <HI>China</HI>-Goods, as cheap as we could at <HI>Nanquin.</HI></P>
<P>Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of which he was very opiniated or conceit|ed, I told him, we were Gentlemen, as well as Merchants, and that we had a Mind to go and &s;ee the great City of <HI>Pecking,</HI> and the famous Court of the Monarch of <HI>China.</HI> Why then, &s;ays the old Man, you &s;hould go to <HI>Ningpo,</HI> where, by the River which runs into the Sea there, you may go up within five Leagues of the
<PB N="275" REF="284">
<HI>Great Canal.</HI> This Canal is a navigable River, which goes thorow the Heart of that va&s;t Empire of <HI>China,</HI> cro&s;&s;es all the Rivers, pa&s;&s;es &s;ome con|&s;iderable Hills by the Help of Sluices and Gates, and goes up to the City of <HI>Pecking,</HI> being in Length near 270 Leagues.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, <HI>Seignior Portugue&s;e,</HI> but that is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s now: The great Que&s;tion is, If you can carry us up to the City of <HI>Nanquin,</HI> from whence we can travel to <HI>Pecking</HI> afterwards? Yes, he &s;aid, he could do &s;o very well, and that there was a great <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship gone up that Way ju&s;t before. This gave me a little Shock; and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship was now our Terror, and we had much ra|ther have met the Devil, at lea&s;t, if he had not come in too frightful a Figure; and we depend|ed upon it, that a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship would be our De|&s;truction, for we were in no Condition to fight them; all the Ships they trade with into tho&s;e Parts being of great Burthen, and of much great|er Force than we were.</P>
<P>The old Man found me a little confus'd, and under &s;ome Concern, when he nam'd a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, and &s;aid to me, Sir you need be under no Appre|hen&s;ions of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e they are not now at War with your Nation: No, &s;ays I, that's true; but I know not what Liberties Men may take when they are out of the Reach of the Law: Why, &s;ays he, <HI>you are no Pirates,</HI> what need you fear? They will not meddle with peaceable Mer|chants &s;ure.</P>
<P>If I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly up into my Face at that Word, it was hin|der'd by &s;ome Stop in the Ve&s;&s;els, appointed by
<PB N="276" REF="285">
Nature to prevent it; for it put me into the grea|te&s;t Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion imaginable: Nor was it po&s;&s;ible for me to conceal it &s;o, but that the old Man ea&s;ily perceiv'd it.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays he, I find you are in &s;ome Di&s;order in your Thoughts at my Talk, pray be pleas'd to go which Way you think fit, and depend upon it, I'll do you all the Service I can. Why, Seig|nior, &s;aid I, it is true I am a little un&s;ettled in my Re&s;olution at this Time whither to go in particu|lar; and I am &s;omething more &s;o, for what you &s;aid about <HI>Pirates,</HI> I hope there are no Pirates in the&s;e Seas; we are but in an ill Condition to meet with them, for you &s;ee we have but a &s;mall Force, and but very weakly mann'd.</P>
<P>O Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> do not be concern'd, I do not know that there has been any Pirates in the&s;e Seas the&s;e fifteen Years, except one which was &s;een, as I hear, in the Bay of <HI>Siam,</HI> about a Month &s;ince; but you may be a&s;&s;ured &s;he is gone to the South|ward; nor was &s;he a Ship of any great Force, or fit for the Work; &s;he was not built for a Pri|vateer, but was run away with by a reprobate Crew that were on Board, after the Captain and &s;ome of his Men had been murther'd by the <HI>Ma|layans,</HI> at or near the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>What! SAID I, <HI>&s;eeming to know nothing of the Matter,</HI> Did they murther the Captain? No, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I do not under&s;tand that they murther'd him; but as they afterwards run away with the Ship, it is generally believ'd they betray'd him into the Hands of the <HI>Malayans,</HI> who did murther him, and perhaps they procur'd them to do it: Why then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> they de&s;erve Death as much as if they had
<PB N="277" REF="286">
done it them&s;elves: Nay, <HI>&s;ays the old Man,</HI> they do de&s;erve it, and they will certainly have it, if they light upon any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship; for they have all agreed together, that if they meet that Rogue, they will give him no Quarter.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> you &s;ay the Pirate is gone out of tho&s;e Seas, how can they meet with him? Why, that is true, &s;ays he, they do &s;ay &s;o; but he was, as I tell you, in the Bay of <HI>Siam,</HI> in the River <HI>Cambodia,</HI> and was di&s;covered there by &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Men who belonged to the Ship, and who were left on Shore when they run away with her; and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders being in the River, they were within a little of taking him: Nay, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if the foremo&s;t Boats had been well &s;econded by the re&s;t, they had certainly taken him; but he finding only two Boats within Reach of him, tack'd about, and fir'd at the&s;e two, and di&s;abled them before the other came up, and then &s;tanding off to Sea, the other were not able to follow him, and &s;o he got away: But they have all &s;o exact a De&s;cription of the Ship, that they will be &s;ure to know him; and where-ever they find him, they have vow'd to give no Quarter to either the Captain, or the Seamen, but to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm.</P>
<P>What! &s;ays I, will they execute them right or wrong, hang them fir&s;t, and judge them after|wards? O Sir! &s;ays the old Pilot, there's no Need to make a formal Bu&s;ine&s;s of it with &s;uch Rogues as tho&s;e, let them tye them Back to Back, and &s;et them a diving; 'tis no more than they richly de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="287">
I knew I had my old Man fa&s;t aboard, and that he could do me no Harm, &s;o that I turn'd &s;hort upon him: Well now, Seignior, &s;aid I, and this is the very Rea&s;on, why I would have you carry us up to <HI>Nanquin,</HI> and not to put back to <HI>Macao,</HI> or to any other part of the Country, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships come; for be it known to you, Seignior, tho&s;e Captains of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, are a Parcel of ra&s;h, proud, in&s;olent Fellows, that neither knows what belongs to Ju&s;tice, nor how to behave them&s;elves, as the Laws of God and Nature direct; but being proud of their Offices, and not under&s;tanding their Power, they would act the Murtherers to puni&s;h Robbers; would take upon them to in&s;ult Men fal&s;ly accu&s;ed, and determine them guilty without due Enquiry; and perhaps I may live to call &s;ome of them to an Account for it, where they may be taught how Ju&s;tice is to be executed, and that no Man ought to be treated as a Crimi|nal, 'till &s;ome Evidence may be had of the Crime, and that he is the Man.</P>
<P>With this I told him, that this was the very Ship they attack'd, and gave him a full Account of the Skirmi&s;h we had with their Boats, and how fooli&s;hly and coward-like they behav'd. I told him all the Story of our buying the Ship, and how the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men &s;erved us. I told him the Rea&s;ons I had to believe that this Story of killing the Ma|&s;ter by the <HI>Malayans</HI> was true; as al&s;o the running away with the Ship; but that it was all a Fiction of their own, to &s;ugge&s;t that the Men were turn'd <HI>Pirates;</HI> and they ought to have been &s;ure it was &s;o, before they had ventur'd to attack us by Sur|prize, and oblige us to re&s;i&s;t them; adding that they
<PB N="279" REF="288">
would have the Blood of tho&s;e Men, who we kill'd there in our ju&s;t Defence, to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and told us, we were very much in the Right to go away to the <HI>North,</HI> and that if he might advi&s;e us, it &s;hould be to &s;ell the Ship in <HI>China,</HI> which we might very well do, and buy or build another in the Country; and, &s;aid he, though you will not get &s;o good a Ship, yet you may get one able enough to cary you and all your Goods back again to <HI>Bengale,</HI> or any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him, I would take his Advice, when I came to any Port where I could find a Ship for my Turn, or get any Cu&s;tomer to buy this: He reply'd, I &s;hould meet with Cu&s;tomers enough for the Ship at <HI>Nanquin,</HI> and that a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Jonk would &s;erve me very well to go back again; and that he would procure me People, both to buy one and &s;ell the other.</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>Seignior,</HI> &s;ays I, as you &s;ay they know the Ship &s;o well, I may perhaps, if I follow your Mea&s;ures, be in&s;trumental to bring &s;ome hone&s;t innocent Men into a terrible Broil, and perhaps to be murther'd in cold Blood; for wherever they find the Ship, they will prove the Guilt upon the Men, by proving this was the Ship, and &s;o inno|cent Men may probably be overpower'd and murther'd: Why, &s;ays the old Man, I'll find out a Way to prevent that al&s;o; for as I know all tho&s;e Commanders you &s;peak of very well, and &s;hall &s;ee them all as they pa&s;s by, I will be &s;ure to &s;et them to Rights in the Thing, and let them know that they had been &s;o much in the Wrong; that tho' the People, who were on board at fir&s;t,
<PB N="280" REF="289">
might run away with the Ship, yet it was not true that they had turned Pirates; and that in par|ticular, the&s;e were not the Men that fir&s;t went off with the Ship, but innocently bought her for their Trade; and I am per&s;uaded they will &s;o far be|lieve me, as at lea&s;t to act more cautiou&s;ly for the Time to come. Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> And will you deliver one Me&s;&s;age to them from me? Yes, I will, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you will give it under your Hand in Writing, that I may be able to prove, that it came from you, and not out of my own Head. I an&s;wered, That I would readily give it him under my Hand; &s;o I took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large the Story of a&s;&s;aulting me with the Long-Boats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the pretended Rea&s;on of it, and the unju&s;t cruel De&s;ign of it; and concluded to the Commanders, that they had done what they not only &s;hould ha' been a&s;ham'd of, but al&s;o, that if ever they came to <HI>England,</HI> and I liv'd to &s;ee them there, they &s;hould all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of my Country were not grown out of U&s;e before I arrived there.</P>
<P>My old Pilot read this over and over again, and ask'd me &s;everal Times if I would &s;tand to it? I an&s;wer'd, I would &s;tand to it as long as I had any Thing left in the World, being &s;en&s;ible that I &s;hould one Time or other find an Opportunity to put it home to them: But we had no Occa&s;i|on ever to let the Pilot carry this Letter; for he never went back again: While tho&s;e Things were pa&s;&s;ing between us, by Way of Di&s;cour&s;e, we went forward, directly for <HI>Nanquin,</HI> and in about thirteen Days Sail came to an An|chor at the South We&s;t Point of the great Gulph of <HI>Nanquin,</HI> where, by the Way, I came by Ac|cident to under&s;tand, that two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were
<PB N="281" REF="290">
gone the length before me, and that I &s;hould cer|tainly fall into their Hands; I con&s;ulted my Partner again in this Exigency, and he was as much at a Lo&s;s as I was, and would very gladly have been &s;afe on Shore almo&s;t any where; however, I was not in &s;uch Perplexity neither, but I ask'd the old Pilot, if there was no Creek or Harbour, which I might put into, and pur|&s;ue my Bu&s;ine&s;s with the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> privately, and be in no Danger of the Enemy: he told me, if I would &s;ail to the Southward about two and forty Leagues, there was a little Port call'd <HI>Quinchang,</HI> where the Fathers of the Mi&s;&s;ion u&s;u|ally landed from <HI>Macao,</HI> on their Progre&s;s to teach the Chri&s;tian Religion to the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and where no <HI>European</HI> Ships ever put in; and if I thought to put in there, I might con&s;ider what farther Cour&s;e to take when I was on Shore: He con|fe&s;s'd, he &s;aid, it was not a Place for Merchants, except that at &s;ome certain Times, they had a kind of a Fair there, when the Merchants from <HI>Japan</HI> came over thither to buy the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchandizes.</P>
<P>We all agreed to go back to this Place; the Name of the Port, as he call'd it, I may perhaps &s;pell wrong; for I do not particularly remem|ber it, having lo&s;t this, together with the Names of many other Places, &s;et down in a little Pocket-Book, which was &s;poil'd by the Water, on an Accident, which I &s;hall relate in its Order; but this I remember, that the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Merchants we corre&s;ponded with, call'd it by a differing Name from that which our <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilot gave it, and pronounc'd it as above, <HI>Quinchang.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="291">
As we were unanimous in our Re&s;olutions to go to this Place, we weigh'd the next Day, ha|ving only gone twice on Shore, where we were to get fre&s;h Water; on both which Occa&s;ions, the People of the Country were very civil to us, and brought us abundance of Things <HI>to &s;ell to us; I mean, of Provi&s;ions,</HI> Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and &s;ome Fowls; but nothing without Money.</P>
<P>We came to the other Port, (the Wind being contrary) not 'till five Days, but it was very much to our Satisfaction; and I was joyful, and I may &s;ay, thankful, when I &s;et my Foot &s;afe on Shore; re&s;olving, and my Partner too, that if it was po&s;&s;ible to di&s;po&s;e of our &s;elves and Effects, any other Way, tho' not every Way to our Satisfa|ction, we would never &s;et one Foot on board that unhappy Ve&s;&s;el more; and indeed I mu&s;t acknowledge, that of all the Circum&s;tances of Life, that ever I had any Experience of, nothing makes Mankind &s;o compleatly mi&s;erable, as that, of being in con&s;tant Fear: Well does the Scrip|ture &s;ay, <HI>the Fear of Man brings a Snare;</HI> it is a Life of Death, and the Mind is &s;o entirely &s;up|pre&s;s'd by it, that it is capable of no Relief; the animal Spirits &s;ink, and all the Vigour of Na|ture, which u&s;ually &s;upports Men under other Afflictions, and is pre&s;ent to them in the grea|te&s;t Exigencies, fails them here.</P>
<P>Nor did it fail of its u&s;ual Operations upon the Fancy, by heightening every Danger, repre|&s;enting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains, to be Men uncapable of hearing Rea&s;on, or of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between hone&s;t Men and Rogues; or between a Story calculated for our own Turn, made out of nothing, on Purpo&s;e to deceive;
<PB N="283" REF="292">
and a true genuine Account of our whole Voy|age, Progre&s;s, and De&s;ign; for we might many Ways have convinc'd any rea&s;onable Creature, that we were not Pirates; the Goods we had on board, the Cour&s;e we &s;teer'd, or frankly &s;hew|ing our &s;elves, and entring into &s;uch and &s;uch Ports; and even our very Manner, the Force we had, the Number of Men, the few Arms, little Ammunition, &s;hort Provi&s;ions; all the&s;e would have &s;erv'd to convince any Men, that we were no Pirates; the Opium, and other Goods we had on board, would make it appear, the Ship had been at <HI>Bengale;</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, who it was &s;aid, had the Names of all the Men that was in the Ship, might ea&s;ily &s;ee that we were a Mixture of <HI>Engli&s;h, Portugue&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and but two <HI>Dutch</HI> Men on board: The&s;e, and many other particular Circum&s;tances, might have made it evident to the Under&s;tanding of any Comman|der, who&s;e Hands we might fall into, that we were no Pirates.</P>
<P>But Fear, that blind u&s;ele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion, work'd a|nother Way, and threw us into the Vapours; it bewildred our Under&s;tandings, and &s;et the Ima|gination at Work, to form a thou&s;and terrible Things, that perhaps might never happen; we fir&s;t &s;uppos'd, as indeed every Body had related to us, that the Seamen on board the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, but e&s;pecially the <HI>Dutch,</HI> were &s;o en|raged at the Name of a Pirate, and e&s;pecially at our beating of their Boats, and e&s;caping, that they would not give them&s;elves leave to enquire, whether we were Pirates or no; but would ex|ecute us off Hand, as we call it, without giving us any Room for a Defence; we reflected that there was really &s;o much apparent Evidence be|fore
<PB N="284" REF="293">
them, that they would &s;carce enquire after any more; as fir&s;t, That the Ship was certainly the &s;ame, and that &s;ome of the Seamen among them knew her, and had been on board her; and &s;econdly, That when we had Intelligence at the River of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> that they were coming down to examine us, we fought their Boat and fled; &s;o that we made no doubt but they were fully &s;atisfy'd of our being Pirates, as we were &s;a|tisfy'd of the contrary; and as I often &s;aid, I know not but I &s;hould have been apt to have taken tho&s;e Circum&s;tances for Evidence, if the Tables were turn'd, and my Ca&s;e was theirs, and have made no Scruple of cutting all the Crew to Pie|ces, without believing, or perhaps con&s;idering, what they might have to offer in their Defence.</P>
<P>But let that be how it will, tho&s;e were our Apprehen&s;ions; and both my Partner and I too, &s;carce &s;lept a Night, without dreaming of Hal|ters, and Yard-Arms; that is to &s;ay, Gibbets, of fighting, and being taken; of killing and be|ing kill'd; and one Night I was in &s;uch a Fury in my Dream, fancying the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men had boarded us, and I was knocking one of their Seamen down, that I &s;truck my double Fi&s;t a|gain&s;t the Side of the Cabin I lay in, with &s;uch a Force, as wounded my Hand mo&s;t grievou&s;ly, broke my Knuckles, and cut and brui&s;ed the Fle&s;h; &s;o that it not only wak'd me out of my Sleep, but I was once afraid I &s;hould have lo&s;t two of my Fingers.</P>
<P>Another Apprehen&s;ion I had, was of the cruel U&s;age we might meet with from them, if we fell into their Hands; then the Story of <HI>Am|boyna</HI> came into my Head, and how the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
<PB N="285" REF="294">
might perhaps torture us, as they did our Coun|trymen there; and make &s;ome of our Men, by Extremity of Torture, confe&s;s tho&s;e Crimes they never were guilty of; own them&s;elves, and all of us to be Pirates, and &s;o they would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance of Ju|&s;tice; and that they might be tempted to do this, for the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, which was worth four or five thou&s;and Pound, put al|together.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things tormented me and my Partner too, Night and Day; nor did we con&s;ider that the Captains of Ships have no Authority to act thus; and if we had &s;urrender'd Pri&s;oners to them, they could not an&s;wer the de&s;troying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable for it, when they came into their own Country: This I &s;ay, gave me no Satisfaction; for if they will act thus with us, what Advantage would it be to us, that they would be call'd to an Account for it; or if we were fir&s;t to be murthered, what Satisfaction would it be to us to have them puni&s;h'd when they came Home?</P>
<P>I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Re|flections I now had upon the pa&s;t Variety of my particular Circum&s;tances; how hard I thought it was, that I who had &s;pent forty Years in a Life of continu'd Difficulties, and was at la&s;t come as it were to the Port or Haven, which all Men drive at, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to have Re&s;t and Plenty, &s;hould be a Voluntier in new Sorrows, by my own un|happy Choice; and that I, who had e&s;caped &s;o many Dangers in my Youth, &s;hould now come to be hang'd in my old Age, and in &s;o remote a Place, for a Crime I was not in the lea&s;t inclin'd
<PB N="286" REF="295">
to, much le&s;s really guilty of; and in a Place and Circum&s;tance, were Innocence was not like to be any Protection at all to me.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Thoughts, &s;omething of Religion would come in; and I &s;hould be con&s;idering, that this &s;eem'd to me to be a Di&s;po&s;ition of immediate Providence, and I ought to look up|on it, and &s;ubmit to it as &s;uch; that although I was innocent as to Men, I was far from being innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine, what other Crimes in my Life, were mo&s;t obvious to me; and for which, Pro|vidence might ju&s;tly inflict this Puni&s;hment, as a Retribution; and that I ought to &s;ubmit to this, ju&s;t as I would to a Ship-wreck, if it had plea&s;ed God to have brought &s;uch a Di&s;a&s;ter upon me.</P>
<P>In its Turn, Natural Courage would &s;ome|times take its Place; and then I would be talk|ing my &s;elf up to vigorous Re&s;olutions, that I would not be taken, to be barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed by a Parcel of mercyle&s;s Wretches, in cold Blood; that it were much better to have fallen into the Hands of the Savages, who were Man-Eaters, and who, I was &s;ure, would fea&s;t upon me, when they had taken me; than by tho&s;e, who would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by in|human Tortures and Barbarities; that in the Ca&s;e of the Savages, I always re&s;olv'd to die fighting, to the la&s;t Ga&s;p; and why &s;hould I not do &s;o, &s;eeing it was much more dreadful <HI>to me at lea&s;t,</HI> to think of falling into the&s;e Mens Hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men; for the Savages, give them their due, would not eat a Man till he was dead, and kill'd them fir&s;t, as we do a Bullock; but that the&s;e Men had
<PB N="287" REF="296">
many Arts beyond the Cruelty of Death: When ever the&s;e Thoughts prevail'd, I was &s;ure to put my &s;elf in a kind of Fever, with the Agitations of a &s;uppo&s;ed Fight; my Blood would boil, and my Eyes &s;parkle, as if I was engag'd; and I al|ways re&s;olv'd that I would take no Quarter at their Hands; but even at la&s;t, if I could re&s;i&s;t no longer, I would blow up the Ship and all that was in her, and leave them but little Booty to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>By how much the greater Weight, the Anxie|ties and Perplexities of the&s;e Things were to our Thoughts while we were at Sea, by &s;o much the greater was our Satisfaction, when we &s;aw our &s;elves on Shore; and my Partner told me he dream'd, that he had a very heavy Load upon his Back, which he was to carry up a Hill, and found that he was not able to &s;tand long under it; but that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilot came and took it off his Back, and the Hill di&s;appear'd, the Ground before him &s;hewing all &s;mooth and plain, and truly it was &s;o, we were all like Men, who had a Load taken off their Backs.</P>
<P>For my Part, I had a Weight taken off from my Heart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and as I &s;aid above, we re&s;olv'd to go no more to Sea in that Ship: When we came on Shore, the old Pilot, who was now our Friend, got us a Lodging and a Ware-Hou&s;e for our Goods, which by the Way, was much the &s;ame; it was a little Hou&s;e or Hut, with a large Hou&s;e joyning to it, all built with Canes, and palli&s;adoed round with large Canes, to keep out pil&s;ering Thieves, of which, it &s;eems there were not a few in that Country; however, the Magi&s;trates allowed us
<PB N="288" REF="297">
al&s;o a little Guard, and we had a Sentinel with a kind of Halberd, or Half pike, who &s;tood Sentinel at our Door; to whom we allow'd a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money, about the Value of three Pence <HI>per</HI> Day, &s;o that our Goods were kept very &s;afe.</P>
<P>The Fair or Mart, u&s;ually kept in this Place, had been over &s;ome Time; however, we found that there were three or four Jonks in the Ri|ver, and two <HI>Jappanners,</HI> I mean, Ships from <HI>Jappan,</HI> with Goods which they had bought in <HI>China,</HI> and were not gone away, having <HI>Jappo|ne&s;e</HI> Merchants on Shore.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing our old <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilot did for us, was to bring us acquainted with three mi&s;&s;ionary <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, who were in the Town, and who had been there &s;ome Time, converting the People to Chri&s;tianity; but we thought they made but poor Work of it, and made them but &s;orry Chri&s;tians when they had done; however, that was none of our Bu&s;ine&s;s: One of the&s;e was a <HI>French</HI> Man, who they call'd Father <HI>Simon;</HI> he was a jolly well condition'd Man, very free in his Conver&s;ation, not &s;eeming &s;o &s;erious and grave, as the other two did; one of whom was a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and the other a <HI>Genoe&s;e;</HI> but Father <HI>Simon</HI> was courteous, ea&s;y in his Manner, and very agreeable Company; the other two were more re&s;erv'd, &s;eem'd rigid and au&s;tere, and ap|ply'd &s;eriou&s;ly to the Work they came about, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to talk with, and infinuate them&s;elves a|mong the Inhabitants, where-ever they had Op|portunity; we often eat and drank with tho&s;e Men, and tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Conver&s;ion <HI>as they call it,</HI> of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to Chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="289" REF="298">
is &s;o far from the true Conver&s;ion requir'd, to bring Heathen People to the Faith of Chri&s;t, that it &s;eems to amount to little more, than letting them know the Name of Chri&s;t, and &s;ay &s;ome Prayers to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and her Son, in a Tongue which they under&s;tand not, and to cro&s;s them&s;elves and the like; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that the&s;e Religious, who we call Mi&s;&s;ionaries, have a firm Belief that the&s;e People &s;hall be &s;av'd, and that they are the In&s;truments of it; and on this Account, they undergo not only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards of liv|ing in &s;uch Places, but oftentimes Death it &s;elf, with the mo&s;t violent Tortures, for the Sake of of this Work; and it would be a great Want of Charity in us, whatever Opinion we have of the Work it &s;elf, and the Manner of their do|ing it, if we &s;hould not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, who undertook it with &s;o many Hazards, and who have no Pro&s;pect of the lea&s;t Temporal Advantage to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But to return to my Story; this <HI>French</HI> Prie&s;t, Father <HI>Simon,</HI> was appointed it &s;eems, by Or|der of the Chief of the Mi&s;&s;ion, to go up to <HI>Peking,</HI> the Royal Seat of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Emperor, and waited only for another Prie&s;t, who was order'd to come to him from <HI>Macao,</HI> to go a|long with him; and we &s;carce ever met toge|ther, but he was inviting me to go that Jour|ney, telling me, how he would &s;hew me all the glorious Things of that mighty Empire; and a|mong the re&s;t, the greate&s;t City in the World; a City, &s;aid he, that your <HI>London</HI> and our <HI>Paris</HI> put together, cannot be equal to: This was the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> which I confe&s;s is very great, and infinitely full of People; but as I look'd on tho&s;e

Things with different Eyes from other Men, &s;o I &s;hall give my Opinion of them in few Words, when I come in the Cour&s;e of my Travels, to &s;peak more particularly of them.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, I come to my Fryar or Mi&s;&s;ionary; dining with him one Day, and being very mer|ry together, I &s;hew'd &s;ome little Inclination to go with him, and he pre&s;s'd me and my Partner very hard, and with a great many Per|&s;wa&s;ions to con&s;ent; why Father <HI>Simon,</HI> &s;ays my Partner, why &s;hould you de&s;ire our Company &s;o much: You know we are Hereticks, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us Com|pany with any Plea&s;ure? O! &s;ays he, You may perhaps be good Catholicks in Time; my Bu|&s;ine&s;s here is to convert Heathens, and who knows but I may convert you too. Very well, Father, &s;aid I, &s;o you will preach to us all the Way; I won't be trouble&s;ome to you, &s;ays he; our Religion does not dive&s;t us of good Manners; be&s;ides, &s;ays he, we are here like Countrymen, and &s;o we are compared to the Place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and I a Catholick, we may be all Chri&s;tians at la&s;t; at lea&s;t, &s;aid he, we are all Gentlemen, and we may conver&s;e &s;o, without being unea&s;y to one another. I lik'd that Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e very well, and it be|gan to put me in Mind of my Prie&s;t, that I had left in the <HI>Bra&s;ils;</HI> but this Father <HI>Simon</HI> did not come up to his Character, by a great deal; for tho' Father <HI>Simon</HI> had no Appearance of a Cri|minal Levity in him neither, yet he had not that Fund of Chri&s;tian Zeal, &s;trict Piety, and &s;incere Affection to Religion, that my other good Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick had, of whom I have &s;aid &s;o much.</P>

But to leave him a little, tho' he never left us, nor &s;oliciting us to go with him; but we had &s;omething el&s;e before us at fir&s;t; for we had all this while our Ship, and our Merchan|dize to di&s;po&s;e of, and we began to be very doubt|ful what we &s;hould do, for we were now in a Place of very little Bu&s;ine&s;s; and once I was a|bout to venture to &s;ail for the River of <HI>Kilam,</HI> and the City of <HI>Nanquin:</HI> But Providence &s;eem'd now more vi&s;ibly as I thought, than ever, to concern it &s;elf in our Affair; and I was encou|raged from this very Time, to think, I &s;hould one Way or other get out of this tangled Cir|cum&s;tance, and be brought Home to my own Country again, tho' I had not the lea&s;t View of the Manner: and when I began &s;ometimes to think of it, could not imagine by what Me|thod it was to be done: Providence, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> be|gan here to clear up our Way a little; and the fir&s;t Thing that offered was, that our old <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> Pilot brought a <HI>Japan</HI> Merchant to us, who began to enquire what Goods we had; and in the fir&s;t Place, he bought all our Opium, and gave us a very good Price for it, paying us in Gold by Weight, &s;ome in &s;mall Pieces of their own Coin, and &s;ome in &s;mall Wedges, of a|bout ten or eleven Ounces each. While we were dealing with him for our Opium, it came into my Head, that he might perhaps deal with us for the Ship too, and I ordered the Inter|preter to propo&s;e it to him; he &s;hrunk up his Shoulders at it, when it was fir&s;t propos'd to him; but in a few Days after, he came to me with one of the mi&s;&s;ionary Prie&s;ts for his Interpreter, and told me, he had a Propo&s;al to make to me, and that was this; he had bought
<PB N="292" REF="301">
a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he had no Thoughts (or Propo&s;als made to him) of buy|ing the Ship; and that therefore, he had not Money enough to pay for the Ship; but if I would let the &s;ame Men who were in the Ship navigate her, he would hire the Ship to go to <HI>Japan,</HI> and would &s;end them from thence to the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands with another Loading, which he would pay the Freight of, before they went from <HI>Japan;</HI> and that at their Return, he would buy the Ship: I began to li&s;ten to his Pro|po&s;al, and &s;o eager did my Head &s;till run up|on Rambling, that I could not but begin to en|tertain a Notion of going my &s;elf with him, and &s;o to &s;ail from the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, away to the South Seas; and accordingly I ask'd the <HI>Ja|pane&s;e</HI> Merchant, if he would not hire us to the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and di&s;charge us there; he &s;aid, no he could not do that, for then he could not have the return of his Cargo; but he would di&s;charge us in <HI>Japan,</HI> he &s;aid, at the Ship's Ret urn. Well, &s;till I was for taking him at that Propo&s;al, and going my &s;elf; but my Partner, wi&s;er than my &s;elf, per&s;uaded me from it, repre&s;enting the Dangers as well of the Seas, as of the <HI>Japane&s;es,</HI> who are a fal&s;e, cruel, and treacherous People; and then of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> at the <HI>Philippines,</HI> more fal&s;e, more cruel, and more treacherous than they.</P>
<P>But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Conclu&s;ion; the fir&s;t Thing we had to do, was to con&s;ult with the Captain of the Ship, and with his Men, and know if they were wil|ling to go to <HI>Japan;</HI> and while I was doing this, the young Man, who, as I &s;aid, my Ne|phew had left with me as my Companion for
<PB N="293" REF="302">
my Travels, came to me, and told me, that he thought that Voyage promi&s;ed very fair, and that there was a great Pro&s;pect of Ad|vantage, and he would be very glad if I under|took it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a Merchant, or how I pleas'd to order him; that if ever he came to <HI>England,</HI> and I was there and alive; he would render me a faithful Account of his Succe&s;s, and it &s;hould be as much mine as I pleas'd.</P>
<P>I was really loth to part with him, but con|&s;idering the Pro&s;pect of Advantage which was really con&s;iderable, and that he was a young Fellow, as likely to do well in it, as any I knew, I inclin'd to let him go; but fir&s;t I told him, I would con&s;ult my Partner, and give him an An&s;wer the next Day; my Partner and I di&s;cours'd about it, and my Partner made a mo&s;t generous Offer; he told me, you know it has been an unlucky Ship, and we both re&s;olve not to go to Sea in it again; if your Steward, <HI>&s;o he call'd my Man,</HI> will venture the Voyage, I'll leave my Share of the Ve&s;&s;el to him, and let him make his be&s;t of it; and if we live to meet in <HI>England,</HI> and he meets with Succe&s;s abroad, he &s;hall account for one Half of the Profits of the Ship's Freight to us, the other &s;hall be his own.</P>
<P>If my Partner, who was no Way concerned with my young Man, made him &s;uch an Offer, I could do no le&s;s than offer him the &s;ame; and all the Ship's Company being willing to go with him, we made over Half the Ship to him in Property, and took a Writing from him, obli|ging
<PB N="294" REF="303">
him to account for the other, and away he went to <HI>Japan:</HI> The <HI>Japan</HI> Merchant prov'd a very punctual hone&s;t Man to him, protected him at <HI>Japan,</HI> and got him a Licen&s;e to come on Shore, which the <HI>Europeans</HI> in general have not lately obtained; pay'd him his Freight very punctually, &s;ent him to the <HI>Philippines,</HI> loaded with <HI>Japan,</HI> and <HI>China</HI> Wares, and a Supra-Cargo of their own, who trafficking with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> brought back <HI>European</HI> Goods again, and a great Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice; and there he was not only pay'd his Freight ve|ry well, and at a very good Price, but being not willing to &s;ell the Ship then, the Merchant furni&s;h'd him with Goods, on his own Account; that for &s;ome Money, and &s;ome Spices of his own, which he brought with him, he went back to the <HI>Manillas</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where he &s;old his Cargo very well: Here having gotten a good Acquaintance at <HI>Manilla,</HI> he got his Ship made a free Ship; and the Governor of <HI>Manilla</HI> hired him, to go to <HI>Accapulco,</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and gave him a Licen&s;e to Land there, and travel to <HI>Mexico,</HI> and to pa&s;s in any <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship to <HI>Europe,</HI> with all his Men.</P>
<P>He made the Voyage to <HI>Accapulco</HI> very happily, and there he &s;old his Ship; and having there al&s;o obtained Allowance to travel by Land, to <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> he found Means &s;ome how or other, to get to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> with all his Trea&s;ure; and about eight Years after, came to <HI>England</HI> ex|ceeding Rich; of the which, I &s;hall take Notice in its Place; in the mean Time, I return to our particular Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="304">
Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Com|pany; it came before us of Cour&s;e, to con&s;ider what Recompence we &s;hould give to the two Men, that gave us &s;uch timely Notice of the De&s;ign again&s;t us in the River of <HI>Cambodia:</HI> The Truth was, they had done us a con&s;iderable Service, and de&s;erv'd well at our Hands; tho' <HI>by the Way,</HI> they were a Couple of Rogues too; for as they believ'd the Story of our being Pirates, and that we had really run away with the Ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the De|&s;ign that was form'd again&s;t us, but to go to Sea with us as Pirates; and one of them confe&s;s'd afterwards, that nothing el&s;e but the Hopes of going a Roguing brought him to do it; how|ever, the Service they did us was not the le&s;s; and therefore, as I had promis'd to be grateful to them, I fir&s;t order'd the Money to be pay'd to them, which they &s;aid was due to them on board their re&s;pective Ships; that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man nineteen Months Pay, and to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man &s;even; and over and above that, I gave them, each of them, a &s;mall Sum of Mo|ney in God, and which contented them very well; then I made the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man Gunner in the Ship, the Gunner being now made Second Mate, and Pur&s;er; the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man I made Boat|&s;wain; &s;o they were both very well pleas'd, and prov'd very &s;erviceable, being both able Seamen, and very &s;tout Fellows.</P>
<P>We were now on Shore in <HI>China;</HI> if I thought my &s;elf bani&s;h'd, and remote from my own Country at <HI>Bengale,</HI> where I had many Ways to get home for my Money; what could I think of my &s;elf now? When I was gotten about a
<PB N="296" REF="305">
thou&s;and Leagues farther off from Home, and perfectly de&s;titute of all manner of Pro&s;pect of Return.</P>
<P>All we had for it was this, that in about four Months Time, there was to be another Fair at the Place where we were; and then we might be able to purcha&s;e all &s;orts of the Manufactures of the Country, and withal, might po&s;&s;ibly find &s;ome <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Jonks or Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Tonquin,</HI> that would be to be &s;old, and would carry us and our Goods, whither we pleas'd; this I lik'd very well, and re&s;olv'd to wait; be&s;ides, as our particular Per&s;ons were not obnoxious, &s;o if any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships came thither, perhaps we might have an Opportunity to load our Goods, and get Pa&s;&s;age to &s;ome other Place in <HI>India,</HI> nearer Home.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Hopes we re&s;olv'd to continue here; but to divert our &s;elves, we took two or three Journeys into the Country; fir&s;t we went ten Days Journey to &s;ee the City of <HI>Nanquin,</HI> and a City well worth &s;eeing indeed; they &s;ay it has a Million of People in it; which however, I do not believe; it is regularly built, the Streets all exactly &s;trait, and cro&s;s one another, in direct Lines, which gives the Figure of it great Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>But when I come to compare the mi&s;erable People of the&s;e Countries with ours, their Fa|bricks, their manner of Living, their Govern|ment, their Religion, their Wealth, and their Glory, (as &s;ome call it) I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not &s;o much as think it is worth naming, or worth my while to write of, or any that &s;hall come after me to read.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="306">
It is veryob&s;ervable that we wonder at the Grandeur, the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremo|nies, the Government, the Manufactures, the Commerce, and the Conduct of the&s;e People; not that it is to be wonder'd at, or indeed in the lea&s;t to be regarded; but becau&s;e, having fir&s;t a true Notion of the Barbarity of tho&s;e Countries, the Rudene&s;s and the Ignorance that prevails there, we do not expect to find any &s;uch things &s;o far off.</P>
<P>Otherwi&s;e, what are their Buildings to the Palaces and Royal Buildings of <HI>Europe?</HI> What their Trade, to the univer&s;al Commerce of <HI>England, Holland, France</HI> and <HI>Spain?</HI> What are their Cities to ours, for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of Appa|rel, rich Furniture, and an infinite Variety? What are their Ports, &s;upply'd with a few Jonks and Barks, to our Navigation, our Merchant Fleets, our large and powerful Navys? Our City of <HI>London</HI> has more Trade than all their mighty Empire: One <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Man of War of 80 Guns, would fight and de&s;troy all the Shipping of <HI>China:</HI> But the Greatne&s;s of their Wealth, their Trade, the Power of their Govern|ment, and Strength of their Armies, is &s;urpri&s;ing to us, becau&s;e, as I have &s;aid, con&s;idering them as a barbarous Nation of Pagans, little better than Savages, we did not expect &s;uch Things among them; and this indeed is the Advantage with which all their Greatne&s;s and Power is repre|&s;ented to us; otherwi&s;e it is in it &s;elf nothing at all; for as I have &s;aid of their Ships, &s;o may be &s;aid of their Armies and Troops; all the Forces of their Empire, tho' they were to bring two Mil|lions of Men into the Field together, would
<PB N="298" REF="307">
be able to do nothing but ruin the Country, and &s;tarve them&s;elves: If they were to be&s;iege a &s;trong Town in <HI>Flanders,</HI> or to fight a di&s;ciplin'd Army, one Line of <HI>German</HI> Curia&s;&s;iers, or of <HI>French</HI> Caval|ry, would overthrow all the Hor&s;e of <HI>China;</HI> A Mil|lion of their Foot could not &s;tand before one em|battled Body of our Infantry, po&s;ted &s;o as not to be &s;urrounded, tho' they were to be not One to Twenty in Number; nay, I do not boa&s;t, if I &s;ay that 30000 <HI>German</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot, and 10000 <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e, would fairly beat all the Forces of <HI>China:</HI> And &s;o of our fortified Towns, and of the Art of our Engineers in a&s;&s;aulting and defending Towns; there's not a fortified Town in <HI>China,</HI> could hold out one Month again&s;t the Batteries and Attacks of an <HI>European</HI> Army; and at the &s;ame time, all the Armies of <HI>China</HI> could never take &s;uch a Town as <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> provided it was not &s;tarv'd; no, not in a ten Years Siege. They have Fire-Arms, 'tis true, but they are awkward, clum&s;y, and uncertain in going off: They have Powder, but it is of no Strength: They have neither Di&s;cipline in the Field, Exerci&s;e to their Arms, Skill to Attack, or Temper to Retreat; and therefore, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it &s;eem'd &s;trange to me, when I came home, and heard our People &s;ay &s;uch fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glo|ry, Magnificence, and Trade of the <HI>Chine&s;e;</HI> be|cau&s;e I &s;aw, and knew, that they were a contemp|tible Herd or Crowd of ignorant &s;ordid Slaves, &s;ubjected to a Government qualified only to rule &s;uch a People; and in a word, for I am now launch'd quite be&s;ide my De&s;ign, I &s;ay, in a word, were not its Di&s;tance inconceivably great from <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and was not the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Empire almo&s;t as rude, impotent, and ill govern'd a Crowd of Slaves as they, the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> might with
<PB N="299" REF="308">
much Ea&s;e drive them all out of their Country, and conquer them in one Campaign; and had the Czar, who I &s;ince hear is a growing Prince, and begins to appear formidable in the World, fallen this Way, in&s;tead of attacking the Warlike <HI>Swedes,</HI> in which Attempt none of the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> would have envy'd or interrupted him; he might by this time have been Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> in&s;tead of being beaten by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Narva,</HI> when the latter was not One to Six in Number. As their Strength and their Grandeur, &s;o their Na|vigation, Commerce, and Husbandry, is imper|fect and impotent, compar'd to the &s;ame Things in <HI>Europe;</HI> al&s;o in their Knowledge, their Learn|ing, their Skill in the Sciences; they have Globes and Spheres, and a Smatch of the Knowledge of the Mathematicks; but when you come to enquire into their Knowledge, how &s;hort-&s;ight|ed are the wi&s;e&s;t of their Students! they know nothing of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies; and &s;o gro&s;ly ab&s;urdly ignorant, that when the Sun is eclips'd, they think 'tis a great Dragon has a&s;&s;aulted, and run away with it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums and Kettles in the Country, to fright the Mon&s;ter away, ju&s;t as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees.</P>
<P>As this is the only Excur&s;ion of this kind which I have made in all the Account I have given of my Travels, &s;o I &s;hall make no more De&s;criptions of Countrys and People, 'tis none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, or any part of my De&s;ign; but giving an Account of my own Adventures, through a Life of inimi|table Wandrings, and a long Variety of Changes, which perhaps few that come after me will have heard the like of; I &s;hall therefore &s;ay very little of all the mighty Places, de&s;art Countrys, and
<PB N="300" REF="309">
numerous People, I have yet to pa&s;s thro' more than relates to my own Story, and which my Con|cern among them will make nece&s;&s;ary. I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of <HI>China,</HI> about the Latitude of thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we were return'd from <HI>Nanquin;</HI> I had indeed a mind to &s;ee the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> which I had heard &s;o much of, and Father <HI>Simon</HI> importun'd me daily to do it; at length his Time of going away being &s;et, and the other Mi&s;&s;ionary, who was to go with him, being arriv'd from <HI>Macao,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould re&s;olve, either to go, or not to go; &s;o I referr'd him to my Partner, and left it wholly to his Choice, who at length re&s;olv'd it in the Affirmative, and we prepar'd for our Journey. We &s;et out with very good Advan|tage, as to finding the Way, for we got leave to travel in the Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of Viceroy, or principal Magi&s;trate in the Province where they re&s;ide, and who take great State upon them, travelling with great Atten|dance, and with great Homage from the People, who are &s;ometimes greatly impoveri&s;h'd by them, becau&s;e all the Countries they pa&s;s thro' are oblig'd to furni&s;h Provi&s;ions for them and all their At|tendance: That which I particularly ob&s;erved, as to our travelling with his Baggage, was this, that tho' we receiv'd &s;ufficient Provi&s;ions, both for our &s;elves and our Hor&s;es, from the Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet were oblig'd to pay for every thing we had, after the Mar|ket Price of the Country, and the Mandarin's Steward, or Commi&s;&s;ary of the Provi&s;ions, col|lected it duly from us; &s;o that our travelling in the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was a very great Kindne&s;s to us, was not &s;uch a mighty Favour in him, but was indeed a great Advantage
<PB N="301" REF="310">
to him, con&s;idering there were above thirty o|ther People travell'd in the &s;ame Manner be&s;ides us, under the Protection of his Retinue, or as we may call it, under his Convoy: This, I &s;ay, was a great Advantage to him, for the Country furni&s;h'd all the Provi&s;ions for nothing, and he took all our Money for them.</P>
<P>We were five and twenty Days travelling to <HI>Peking,</HI> through a Country infinitely populous, but mi&s;erably cultivated; the Husbandry, the Oe|conomy, and the Way of living mi&s;erable, tho' they boa&s;t &s;o much of the Indu&s;try of the People; I &s;ay, mi&s;erable; and &s;o it is, if we who under|&s;tand how to live were to endure it, or to com|pare it with our own, but not &s;o to the&s;e poor Wretches who know no other: The Pride of the&s;e People is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty, which adds to that which I call their Mi&s;ery; and I mu&s;t needs think the naked Savages of <HI>America</HI> live much more happy, becau&s;e, as they have nothing, &s;o they de&s;ire nothing; whereas the&s;e are proud and in&s;olent, and in the main are meer Beggars and Drudges; their O&s;tentation is inexpre&s;&s;ible, and is chiefly &s;hew'd in their Cloaths and Building, and in the keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which is to the la&s;t Degree ridiculous, their Contempt of all the World but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I travell'd more plea&s;antly after|wards in the De&s;arts and va&s;t Wilderne&s;&s;es of Grand <HI>Tartary,</HI> than here; and yet the Roads here are well pav'd, and well kept, and very con|venient for Travellers; but nothing was more aukward to me, than to &s;ee &s;uch a haughty, im|perious, in&s;olent People, in the mid&s;t of the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t
<PB N="302" REF="311">
Simplicity and Ignorance, for all their fam'd Ingenuity is no more: And my Friend Father <HI>Simon</HI> and I us'd to be very merry upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, to &s;ee the beggarly Pride of tho&s;e People; for Example: Coming by the Hou&s;e of a Country Gentleman, as Father <HI>Simon</HI> call'd him, about ten Leagues off of the City of <HI>Nanquin,</HI> we had fir&s;t of all the Honour to ride with the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e about two Miles: The State he rode in, was a perfect Don <HI>Quixoti&s;m,</HI> being a Mixture of Pomp and Poverty.</P>
<P>The Habit of this grea&s;y Don was very pro|per for a Scaramouch or Merry-Andrew, being a dirty Callicoe, with all the Tawdry and Trap|ping of a Fool's-Coat, &s;uch as Hanging-Sleeves, To&s;&s;els, and Cuts and Sla&s;hes almo&s;t on every Side; it cover'd a Taffaty Ve&s;t, as grea&s;y as a Butcher, and which te&s;tify'd that his Honour mu&s;t needs be a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Sloven.</P>
<P>His Hor&s;e was a poor, lean, &s;tarv'd, hobbling Creature, &s;uch as in <HI>England</HI> might &s;ell for about 30 or 40 Shillings, and he had two Slaves fol|low'd him on Foot, to drive the poor Creature along; he had a Whip in his Hand, and he be|labour'd the Bea&s;t as fa&s;t about the Head, as his Slaves did about the Tail, and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve Servants, and we were told he was going from the City to his Country Seat, about half a League before us: We travell'd on gently, but this Figure of a Gentleman rode away before us, and as we &s;top'd at a Village about an Hour to refre&s;h us, when we came by the Country Seat of this great Man, we &s;aw him in a little Place, before his Door, eating his Repa&s;t; it was a kind of a Garden,
<PB N="303" REF="312">
but he was ea&s;y to be &s;een, and we were given to under&s;tand that the more we look'd on him, the better he would be pleas'd.</P>
<P>He &s;at under a Tree, &s;omething like the Pal|metto Tree, which effectually &s;haded him over the Head, and on the South Side, but under the Tree al&s;o, was plac'd a large Umbrello, which made that Part look well enough; he &s;at lolling back in a great Elbow-Chair, being a heavy cor|pulent Man, and his Meat being brought him by two Women Slaves; he had two more, who&s;e Office, I think, few Gentlemen in <HI>Europe</HI> would accept of their Service in, <HI>(viz.)</HI> One fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other held the Di&s;h with one Hand, and &s;crap'd off what he let fall upon his Wor&s;hip's Beard and Taf|faty Ve&s;t, while the great fat Brute thought it below him to employ his own Hands in any of tho&s;e familiar Offices, which Kings and Mo|narchs would rather do, than be troubled with the clum&s;y Fingers of their Servants.</P>
<P>I took this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride puts them to; and how trouble&s;ome a haugh|ty Temper, thus ill-manag'd, mu&s;t be to a Man of common Sen&s;e; and leaving the poor Wretch to plea&s;e him&s;elf with our looking at him, as if we admir'd his Pomp, whereas we really pity'd and contemn'd him, we per&s;u'd our Journey; only Father <HI>Simon</HI> had the Curio&s;ity to &s;tay to inform him&s;elf what Dainties the Country Ju&s;tice had to feed on, in all his State, which he &s;aid he had the Honour to ta&s;te of, and which was, I think, a Do&s;e that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hound would &s;carce have eaten, if it had been offer'd him, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a Me&s;s of boil'd Rice, with a great Piece of Garlick in it,
<PB N="304" REF="313">
and a little Bag fill'd with Green Pepper, and another Plant which they have there, &s;omething like our Ginger, but &s;melling like Musk, and ta&s;ting like Mu&s;tard; all this was put together, and a &s;mall Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boil'd in it; and this was his Wor&s;hip's Repa&s;t, four or five Servants more attending at a Di&s;tance. If he fed them meaner than he was fed him&s;elf, the Spice excepted, they mu&s;t fare very coar&s;ely indeed.</P>
<P>As for our Mandarin, with whom we travell'd, he was re&s;pected like a King; &s;urrounded always with his Gentlemen, and attended in all his Ap|pearances with &s;uch Pomp, that I &s;aw little of him but at a Di&s;tance; but this I ob&s;erv'd, that there was not a Hor&s;e in his Retinue, but that our Carriers Pack-Hor&s;es in <HI>England</HI> &s;eem to me to look much better, but they were &s;o cover'd with Equipage, Mantles, Trappings and &s;uch like Trumpery, that you cannot &s;ee whether they are fat or lean; in a Word, we could &s;ee &s;carce any thing but their Feet and their Heads.</P>
<P>I was now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and Perplexity that I have given an Account of being over, I had no anxious Thoughts about me, which made this Journey the plea&s;anter to me, nor had I any ill Accident attended me, only in the pa&s;&s;ing or fording a &s;mall River, my Hor&s;e fell, and made me free of the Country, as they call it, that is to &s;ay, threw me in; the Place was not deep, but it wetted me all over; I men|tion it becau&s;e it &s;poil'd my Pocket-Book, where|in I had &s;et down the Names of &s;everal People and Places which I had Occa&s;ion to remember, and which, not taking due Care of, the Leaves rotted, and the Words were never after to be read, to my
<PB N="305" REF="314">
great Lo&s;s, as to the Names of &s;ome Places I touch'd at in this Voyage.</P>
<P>At length we arriv'd at <HI>Peking;</HI> I had no Body with me but the Youth, who my Nephew, the Captain, had given me to attend me as a Servant, and who proved very tru&s;ty and diligent; and my Partner had no body with him but one Ser|vant, who was a Kin&s;man: as for the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pi|lot, he being de&s;irous to &s;ee the Court, we gave him his Pa&s;&s;age, that is to &s;ay, bore his Charges for his Company; and to u&s;e him as an Interpreter, for he under&s;tood the Language of the Country, and &s;poke good <HI>French,</HI> and a little <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and indeed, this old Man was a mo&s;t u&s;eful Impliment to us every where; for we had not been above a Week at <HI>Peking,</HI> when he came laughing, <HI>Ah, Seignior</HI> Ingli&s;e, &s;ays he, <HI>I have &s;omething to tell you will make your Heart glad. My Heart glad,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>What can that be? I don't know any thing in this Coun|try can either give me Joy or Grief to any great degree. Yes, yes,</HI> &s;aid the old Man in broken <HI>Engli&s;h, make you glad, me &s;orrow; &s;orry</HI> he would have &s;aid. This made me more inqui&s;itive. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>will it make you &s;orry? Becau&s;e,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you have brought me here</HI> 25 <HI>days Journey, and will leave me to go back alone, and which way &s;hall I get to my Port after|wards without a Ship, without a Hor&s;e, without</HI> Pec|cune? So he called Money, being his broken <HI>La|tin,</HI> of which he had abundance to make us mer|ry with.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he told us there was a great Caravan of <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> and <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Merchants in the City, and they were preparing to &s;et out on their Jour|ney by Land to <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> within four or five Weeks, and he was &s;ure we would take the Opportunity
<PB N="306" REF="315">
to go with them, and leave him behind to go back all alone. I confe&s;s, I was &s;urpris'd with his News, a &s;ecret Joy &s;pread it &s;elf over my whole Soul, which I cannot de&s;cribe, and never felt before or &s;ince, and I had no power for a good while to &s;peak a Word to the old Man; but at la&s;t I turn'd to him; How do you know this, &s;aid I, are you &s;ure it is true? Yes, &s;ays he, I met this Morning in the Street an old Acquain|tance of mine, an <HI>Armenian,</HI> or one you call a <HI>Grecian,</HI> who is among them; he came la&s;t from <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> and was de&s;igning to go to <HI>Tonquin,</HI> where I formerly knew him, but has alter'd his mind, and is now re&s;olv'd to go with the Caravan to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and &s;o down the River <HI>Wolga</HI> to <HI>A&s;tra|can.</HI> Well, Segnior, &s;ays I, do not be unea&s;y a|bout being left to go back alone, if this be a Me|thod for my return to <HI>England,</HI> it &s;hall be your Fault if you go back to <HI>Macao</HI> at all. We then went to con&s;ulting together what was to be done, and I ask'd my Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, and whether it would &s;uit with his Affairs? He told me he would do ju&s;t as I would, for he had &s;ettled all his Affairs &s;o well at <HI>Bengale,</HI> and left his Effects in &s;uch good Hands, that as we had made a good Voyage here, if he could ve&s;t it in <HI>China</HI> Silks, wrought and raw, &s;uch as might be worth the Carriage, he would be content to go <HI>England,</HI> and then make his Voyage back to <HI>Bengale,</HI> by the Company's Ships.</P>
<P>Having re&s;olv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our <HI>Portugal</HI> Pilot would go with us, we would bear his Charges to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> or to <HI>England</HI> if he pleas'd; nor indeed were we to be e&s;teem'd over generous in that Part neither, if we had not re|warded
<PB N="307" REF="316">
him farther, for the Service he had done us was really worth all that, and more; for he had not only been a Pilot to us at Sea, but he had been like a Broker for us on Shore; and his pro|curing for us the <HI>Japan</HI> Merchant, was &s;ome hundreds of Pounds in our Pocket: So we con|&s;ulted together about it, and being willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him Ju&s;tice, and very willing al&s;o to have him with us be&s;ides, for he was a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Man on all Occa&s;ions, we agreed to give him a Quantity of coin'd Gold, which, as I compute it, came to a+bout 175 Pounds Sterling between us, and to bear all his Charges, both for him&s;elf and Hor&s;e, ex|cept only a Hor&s;e to carry his Goods.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled this among our &s;elves, we call'd him to let him know what we had re&s;olv'd; I told him, he had complain'd of our being to let him go back alone, and I was now to tell him we was re&s;olv'd he &s;hould not go back at all: that as we had re&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Europe</HI> with the Caravan, we re&s;olv'd al&s;o he &s;hould go with us, and that we call'd him, to know his mind. He &s;hook his Head, and &s;aid, it was a long Journey, and he had no <HI>Pecune</HI> to carry him thither, or to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him&s;elf when he came there. We told him, we believ'd it was &s;o, and therefore we had re&s;olv'd to do &s;omething for him, that &s;hould let him &s;ee how &s;en&s;ible we were of the Service he had done us, and al&s;o how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what we had re&s;olv'd to give him here, which he might lay out as we would do our own; and that as for his Charges, if he would go with us, we would &s;et him &s;afe a-&s;hore, (Life and Ca&s;ualties excepted) either in
<PB N="308" REF="317">
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> which he would, at our own Charge, except only the Carriage of his Goods.</P>
<P>He receiv'd the Propo&s;al like a Man tran&s;ported, and told us he would go with us over the whole World; and &s;o, in &s;hort, we all prepar'd our &s;elves for the Journey: However, as it was with us, &s;o it was with the other Merchants, they had many things to do, and in&s;tead of being ready in five Weeks, it was four Months and &s;ome odd Days, before all Things were got together.</P>
<P>It was the Beginning of <HI>February,</HI> our Stile, when we &s;et out from <HI>Peking;</HI> my Partner and the old Pilot had gone expre&s;s back to the Port where we had fir&s;t put in, to di&s;po&s;e of &s;ome Goods which we had left there; and I with a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchant, who I had &s;ome Knowledge of at <HI>Nanquin,</HI> and who came to <HI>Peking</HI> on his own Affairs, went to <HI>Nanquin,</HI> where I bought ninety Pieces of fine Damasks, with about two hundred Pieces of other very fine Silks, of &s;everal Sorts, &s;ome mix'd with Gold, and had all the&s;e brought to <HI>Peking</HI> again&s;t my Partner's Return; be&s;ides this, we bought a very large Quantity of Raw Silk, and &s;ome other Goods, our Cargo a|mounting in the&s;e Goods only to about three thou|&s;and five hundred Pounds Sterling, which, together with Tea and &s;ome fine Callicoes, and three Camels Loads of Nutmegs and Cloves, loaded in all eighteen Camels for our Share, be&s;ides tho&s;e we rodeupon; which with two or three &s;pare Hor&s;es, and two Hor&s;es loaded with Provi&s;ions, made us in &s;hort 26 Camels and Hor&s;es in our Retinue.</P>
<P>The Company was very great, and, as near as I can remember, made between three and
<PB N="309" REF="318">
four hundred Hor&s;e, and upwards of a hundred and twenty Men, very well armed and provided for all Events: for as the Ea&s;tern Caravans are &s;ubject to be attacked by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> &s;o are the&s;e by the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but they are not altogether &s;o dangerous as the <HI>Arabs,</HI> nor &s;o barbarous when they prevail.</P>
<P>The Company con&s;i&s;ted of People of &s;everal Nations, &s;uch as <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> chiefly, for there were above Sixty of them who were Merchants or In|habitants of <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> tho' of them, &s;ome were <HI>Livonians,</HI> and to our particular Satisfaction, Five of them were <HI>Scots,</HI> who appeared al&s;o to be Men of great Experience in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Men of very good Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>When we had travelled one Days Journey, the Guides, who were Five in Number, called all the Gentlemen and Merchants, that is to &s;ay, all the Pa&s;&s;engers, except the Servants, to a great Council, as they called it: At this great Coun|cil every one depo&s;ited a certain Quantity of Money to a common Stock, for the nece&s;&s;ary Ex|pence of buying Forage on the Way, where it was not otherwi&s;e to be had, and for &s;atisfying the Guides, getting Hor&s;es, and the like: And here they con&s;tituted the Journey, as they call it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> They named Captains and Officers, to draw us all up, and give the Command in ca&s;e of an Attack, and gave every one their turn of Com|mand: nor was this forming us into Order any more than what we found needful upon the Way, as &s;hall be ob&s;erved in its Place.</P>
<P>The Road all on this Side of the Country is very populous, and is full of Potters and Earth|makers,
<PB N="310" REF="319">
that is to &s;ay, People that tamper'd the Earth for the <HI>China</HI> Ware; and as I was coming along, our <HI>Portugal</HI> Pilot, who had always &s;ome|thing or other to &s;ay to make us merry, came &s;neering to me, and told me he would &s;how me the greate&s;t Rarity in all the Country, and that I &s;hould have this to &s;ay of <HI>China,</HI> after all the ill-humour'd things I had &s;aid of it, that I had &s;een one thing which was not to be &s;een in all the World be&s;ide. I was very importunate to know what it was: At la&s;t he told me it was a Gentleman's Hou&s;e built all with <HI>China</HI> Ware. Well, &s;ays I, are not the Materials of their Build|ing the Product of their own Country; and &s;o it is all <HI>China</HI> Ware, is not it? No no, &s;ays he, I mean, it is a Hou&s;e all made of <HI>China</HI> Ware, &s;uch as you call it in <HI>England;</HI> or as it is call'd in our Country, <HI>Porcellain.</HI> Well, &s;ays I, &s;uch a thing may be; how big is it? Can we carry it in a Box upon a Camel? If we can, we will buy it. <HI>Upon a Camel!</HI> &s;ays the old Pilot, holding up both his Hands, <HI>why there is a Family of Thirty People lives in it.</HI></P>
<P>I was then curious indeed to &s;ee it, and when I came to it, it was nothing but this; it was a Timber-Hou&s;e, or a Hou&s;e built, as we call it in <HI>England,</HI> with Lath and Plai&s;ter, but all the Plai&s;tering was really <HI>China</HI> Ware, that is to &s;ay, it was plai&s;ter'd with the Earth that makes <HI>China</HI> Ware.</P>
<P>The Out&s;ide, which the Sun &s;hone hot upon, was glazed, and look'd very well, perfect white, and painted with blue Figures, as the large <HI>China</HI> Ware in <HI>England</HI> is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt: As to the In&s;ide, all the Walls, in|&s;tead
<PB N="311" REF="320">
of Wain&s;cot, were lined up with harden'd and painted Tiles, like the little &s;quare Tiles we call Galley-Tiles in <HI>England,</HI> all made of the fine&s;t China, and the Figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary Variety of Colours mix'd with Gold, many Tiles making but one Figure, but join'd &s;o artificially, the Mortar being made of the &s;ame Earth, that it was very hard to &s;ee where the Tiles met: The Floors of the Rooms were of the &s;ame Compo&s;ition, and as hard as the earthen Floors we have in u&s;e in &s;everal Parts of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Lincoln&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. as hard as Stone, and &s;mooth, but not burnt and painted, except &s;ome &s;maller Rooms, like Clo&s;ets, which were all as it were paved with the &s;ame Tile; the Cielings, and in a word, all the plai&s;tering Work in the whole Hou&s;e were of the &s;ame Earth; and after all, the Roof was cover'd with Tiles of the &s;ame, but of a deep &s;hining black.</P>
<P>This was a <HI>China</HI>-Warehou&s;e indeed, truly and literally to be call'd &s;o; and had I not been upon the Journey, I could have &s;taid &s;ome Days to &s;ee and examine the Particulars of it: they told me there were Fountains and Fi&s;h-ponds in the Gar|den, all paved at the Bottom and Sides with the &s;ame, and fine Statues &s;et up in Rows on the Walks, entirely form'd of the <HI>Porcellain</HI> Earth, and burnt whole.</P>
<P>As this is one of the Singularities of <HI>China,</HI> &s;o they may be allow'd to excel in it; but I am very &s;ure they excel in their Accounts of it; for they told me &s;uch incredible things of their Performance in <HI>Crockery Ware,</HI> for &s;uch it is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be true; they told
<PB N="312" REF="321">
me in particular of one Workman that made a Ship with all its Tackle, and Ma&s;ts, and Sails, in Earthen Ware, big enough to carry fifty Men: If he had told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to <HI>Japan</HI> in it, I might have &s;aid &s;ome|thing to it indeed; but as it was, I knew the whole of the Story, which was in &s;hort, asking Pardon for the Word, that the Fellow lyed; &s;o I &s;miled, and &s;aid nothing to it.</P>
<P>This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Caravan, for which, the Leader of it for the Day, fined me about the Value of three Shillings, and told me, if it had been three Days Journey without the Wall, as it was three Days within, he mu&s;t have fined me four times as much, and made me ask Pardon the next Council Day; &s;o I promi&s;ed to be more orderly; for indeed I found afterward the Orders made for keeping all to|gether, were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our com|mon Safety.</P>
<P>In two Days more, we pa&s;s'd the great <HI>China</HI> Wall, made for a Fortification again&s;t the <HI>Tar|tars;</HI> and a very great Work it is, going over Hills and Mountains in a needle&s;s Track, where the Rocks are impa&s;&s;ible, and the Precipices &s;uch as no Enemy could po&s;&s;ibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where if they did, no Wall could hinder them: They tell us, its Length is near a thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, but that the Country is five hundred in a &s;trait mea&s;ured Line, which the Wall bounds, without mea&s;uring the Windings and Turnings it takes; 'tis about four Fathom high, and as many thick in &s;ome Places.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="322">
I &s;tood &s;till an Hour or thereabout, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing our Orders, <HI>for &s;o long the Caravan was in pa&s;&s;ing the Gate;</HI> I &s;ay, I &s;tood &s;till an Hour to look at it on every Side, near, and far off, I mean, that was within my View; and the Guide of our Caravan, who had been extolling it for the Wonder of the World, was mighty eager to hear my Opinion of it; I told him it was a mo&s;t ex|cellent thing to keep off the <HI>Tartars;</HI> which he happen'd not to under&s;tand as I meant it, and &s;o took it for a Compliment; but the old Pilot laugh'd: O Seignior <HI>Ingle&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, you &s;peak in Colours: In Colours, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> what do you mean by that? Why, you &s;peak what looks white <HI>this way,</HI> and black <HI>that way;</HI> gay <HI>one way,</HI> and dull <HI>another way;</HI> you tell him it is a good Wall to keep out <HI>Tartars;</HI> you tell me <HI>by that,</HI> it is good for nothing but to keep out <HI>Tartars,</HI> or it will keep out none but <HI>Tartars;</HI> I under&s;tand you, Seig|nior <HI>Ingle&s;e,</HI> I under&s;tand you, &s;ays he, but Seig|nior <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> under&s;tood you his own way.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays I, Seignior, do you think it would &s;tand out an Army of our Country People, with a good Train of Artillery; or our Engineers, with two Companies of Miners; would not they bat|ter it down in ten Days, that an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the Air, Foun|dation and all, that there &s;hould be no Sign of it left? Ay, ay, &s;ays he, I know that. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> wanted mightily to know what I &s;aid, and I gave him leave to tell him a few Days after, for we was then almo&s;t out of their Country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward; but when he knew what I had &s;aid, he was dumb all the re&s;t of the way, and we heard no more of his fine
<PB N="314" REF="323">
Story of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Power and Greatne&s;s, while he &s;tay'd.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;s'd this mighty <HI>Nothing</HI> call'd a Wall, &s;omething like the <HI>Picts</HI> Wall, and &s;o fa|mous in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and built by the <HI>Romans,</HI> we began to find the Country thinly inhabited, and the People rather confined to live in fortified Towns and Cities, as being &s;ubject to the Inroads and Depredations of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who rob in great Armies, and therefore are not to be re&s;i&s;ted by the naked Inhabitants of an open Country.</P>
<P>And here I began to find the Nece&s;&s;ity of keep|ing together in a Caravan as we travelled; for we &s;aw &s;everal Troops of <HI>Tartars</HI> roving about; but when I came to &s;ee them di&s;tinctly, I won|der'd more that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Empire could be con|quer'd by &s;uch contemptible Fellows; for they are a meer Hoord or Crowd of wild Fellows, keeping no Order, and under&s;tanding no Di&s;ci|pline, or manner of Fight.</P>
<P>Their Hor&s;es are poor lean &s;tarved Creatures, taught nothing, and fit for nothing; and this we &s;aid, the fir&s;t Day we &s;aw them, which was af|ter we entered the wilder Part of the Country; our Leader for the Day, gave Leave for about &s;ixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call it; and what was this, but hunting of Sheep; however, it may be call'd hunting too; for the Creatures are the wilde&s;t and &s;wifte&s;t of Foot that ever I &s;aw of their Kind; only they will not run a great way, and you are &s;ure of Sport when you begin the Chace; for they appear generally thirty or forty in a Flock, and like true Sheep, always keep together when they fly.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="324">
In pur&s;uit of this odd &s;ort of Game, it was our hap to meet with about forty <HI>Tartars;</HI> whe|ther they were hunting Mutton as we were, or whether they look'd for another kind of Prey, I know not; but as &s;oon as they &s;aw us, one of them blew a kind of a Horn very loud, but with a barbarous Sound, that I had never heard before, and by the way, never care to hear again: we all &s;uppos'd this was to call their Friends about them, and &s;o it was; for in le&s;s than Half a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fifty more appear'd, at about a Mile di&s;tance, but our Work was over fir&s;t, as it happen'd.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> hap|pen'd to be among&s;t us, and as &s;oon as he heard the Horn, he told us in &s;hort, that we had no|thing to do, but to charge them immediately without lo&s;s of Time; and drawing us up in a Line, he ask'd if we were re&s;olv'd? we told him we were ready to follow him; &s;o he rode di|rectly up to them: they &s;tood gazing at us like a meer Crowd, drawn up in no Order, nor &s;hew|ing the Face of any Order at all; but as &s;oon as they &s;aw us advance, they let fly their Arrows, which however mi&s;s'd us very happily; it &s;eems they mi&s;took not their Aim, but their Di&s;tance; for their Arrows all fell a little &s;hort of us, but with &s;o true an Aim, that had we been about twenty Yards nearer, we mu&s;t have had &s;everal Men wounded, if not kill'd.</P>
<P>Immediately we halted, and tho' it was at a great Di&s;tance, we fir'd, and &s;ent them Leaden Bullets, for Wooden Arrows, following our Shot full Gallop, to fall in among them Sword in

Hand, for &s;o our bold <HI>Scot</HI> that led us directed: He was indeed but a Merchant, but he behav'd with that Vigour and Bravery on this occa&s;ion, and yet, with &s;uch a cool Courage too, that I never &s;aw any Man in Action fitter for Com|mand. As &s;oon as we came up to them, we fir'd our Pi&s;tols in their Faces, and then drew, but they fled in the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion imagina|ble; the only Stand any of them made, was on our Right, where three of them &s;tood, and by &s;igns call'd the re&s;t to come back to them, having a kind of Scymiter in their Hands, and their Bows hanging at their Backs. Our brave Commander, without asking any body to fol|low him, gallops up clo&s;e to them, and with his Fuzee knocks one of them off his Hor&s;e, kill'd the &s;econd with his Pi&s;tol, and the third ran away, and thus ended our Fight; but we had this Misfortune attending it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that all our Mutton that we had in chace, got away: We had not a Man kill'd or hurt; but as for the <HI>Tartars,</HI> there was about five of them kill'd; who were wounded, we knew not; but this we knew, that the other Party was &s;o frighted with the Noi&s;e of our Guns, that they made off, and never made any attempt upon us.</P>
<P>We were all this while in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Domi|nion, and therefore the <HI>Tartars</HI> were not &s;o bold as afterwards; but in about five Days we en|ter'd a va&s;t great wild De&s;art, which held us three Days and Nights March; and we were oblig'd to carry our Water with us in great Leather Bottles, and to encamp all Night, ju&s;t as I have heard they do in the De&s;art of <HI>A|rabia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="326">
I ask'd who&s;e Dominion this was in, and they told me, this was a kind of Border, that might be called <HI>no Man's Land;</HI> being a Part of the Great <HI>Karakathie,</HI> or <HI>Grand Tartary,</HI> but that however it was all reckon'd to <HI>China;</HI> but that there was no Care taken here, to pre&s;erve it from the Inroads of Thieves, and therefore it was reckon'd the wor&s;t De&s;art in the whole World; tho' we were to go over &s;ome much larger.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing this Wilderne&s;s, which I confe&s;s was at the fir&s;t very frightful to me, we &s;aw two or three times little Parties of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but they &s;eem'd to be upon their own Affairs, and to have no De&s;ign upon us; and &s;o like the Man who met the Devil, if they had nothing to &s;ay to us, we had nothing to &s;ay to them; we let them go.</P>
<P>Once however, a Party of them came &s;o near, as to &s;tand and gaze at us; whether it was to con&s;ider what they &s;hould do, whether attack us, or not attack us, that we knew not; but when we were pa&s;s'd at &s;ome di&s;tance by them, we made a Rear-Guard of forty men, and &s;tood ready for them, letting the Caravan pa&s;s half a Mile, or thereabouts, before us; but after a while they march'd off, only we found they &s;aluted us with five Arrows at their parting; one of which wounded a Hor&s;e, &s;o that it di&s;abled him; and we left him the next Day, poor Creature, in great need of a good Farrier; we &s;uppo&s;e they might &s;hoot more Arrows, which might fall &s;hort of us, but we &s;aw no more Arrows or <HI>Tartars,</HI> that time.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="327">
We travell'd near a Month after this, the Ways being not &s;o good as at fir&s;t, tho' &s;till in the Do|minions of the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> but lay for the mo&s;t part in Villages, &s;ome of which were for|tified, becau&s;e of the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> When we came to one of the&s;e Towns, (it was about two Days and a Half Journey before we were to come to the City <HI>Naum</HI>) I wanted to buy a Camel, of which there are plenty to be &s;old all the way upon that Road, and of Hor&s;es al&s;o, &s;uch as they are, becau&s;e &s;o many Caravans coming that way, they are often wanted: The Per&s;on that I &s;poke to to get me a Camel, would have gone and fetch'd it for me, but I like a Fool mu&s;t be officious, and go my &s;elf along with him: The Place was about two Miles out of the Vil|lage, where, it &s;eems, they kept the Camels and Hor&s;es feeding under a Guard.</P>
<P>I walk'd it on Foot with my old Pilot, being very de&s;irous, for&s;ooth, of a little Variety: When we came to the Place, it was a low mar&s;hy Ground, wall'd round with a &s;tone Wall, piled up dry, without Mortar or Earth among it, like a Park, with a little Guard of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Soldiers at the Door. Having bought a Camel, and a|greed for the Price, I came away, and the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Man that went with me, led the Camel; when on a &s;udden came up five <HI>Tartars</HI> on Hor&s;e|back; two of them &s;eized the Fellow, and took the Camel from him, while other three &s;tep'd up to me; and my old Pilot, &s;eeing us as it were unarm'd, for I had no Weapon about me but my Sword, which could but ill defend me again&s;t three Hor&s;e-men; the fir&s;t that came up, &s;top'd &s;hort upon my drawing my Sword; (for they are
<PB N="319" REF="328">
errant Cowards) but a Second coming upon my Left, gave me a Blow on the Head, which I ne|ver felt till afterward, and wondered when I came to my &s;elf, what was the matter with me, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the Ground; but my never failing old Pilot, the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> (&s;o Providence unlooked for directs Deliverances from Dangers, which to us are unfore&s;een) had a Pi&s;tol in his Pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the <HI>Tartars;</HI> neither if they had, I &s;uppo&s;e they would not have attack'd us: But Cowards are always bolde&s;t when there is no Danger.</P>
<P>The old Man &s;eeing me down, with a bold Heart &s;tep'd up to the Fellow that had &s;truck me, and laying hold of his Arm with one Hand, and pulling him down by main Force a little to|wards him with the other, &s;hot him into the Head, and laid him dead upon the Spot; he then immediately &s;tep'd up to him who had &s;top'd us, as I &s;aid, and before he could come forward a|gain, (for it was all done as it were in a moment) made a Blow at him with a Scymeter which he al|ways wore, but mi&s;&s;ing the Man, cut his Hor&s;e into the Side of his Head, cut one of his Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice down the Side of his Face; the poor Bea&s;t enraged with the Wound, was no more to be governed by his Rider, tho' the Fellow &s;at well enough too; but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the Pilot's Reach, and at &s;ome Di&s;tance ri&s;ing up upon his hind Legs, threw down the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and fell upon him.</P>
<P>In this Interval the poor <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> came in, who had lo&s;t the Camel, but he had no Weapon; how|ever, &s;eeing the <HI>Tartar</HI> down, and his Hor&s;e fallen
<PB N="320" REF="329">
upon him, away he runs to him, and &s;eizing upon an ugly ill-favour'd Weapon he had by his Side, &s;omething like a Pole-ax, but not a Pole-ax nei|ther, he wrench'd it from him, and made &s;hift to knock his <HI>Tartarian</HI> Brains out with it. But my old Man had the third <HI>Tartar</HI> to deal with &s;till, and &s;eeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but &s;tand &s;tock &s;till, the old Man &s;tood &s;till too, and falls to work with his Tackle to charge his Pi&s;tol again; but as &s;oon as the <HI>Tartar</HI> &s;aw the Pi&s;tol, whether he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the &s;ame, or another, I know not, but away he &s;cowered, and left my Pilot, my Champion I call'd him afterward, a com|pleat Victory.</P>
<P>By this time I was a little awake, for I thought when fir&s;t I began to wake, that I had been in a &s;weet Sleep; but as I &s;aid above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the Ground, and what was the matter: In a word, a few moments after, as Sen&s;e returned, I felt Pain, tho' I did not know where; I clap'd my Hand to my Head, and took it away bloody; then I felt my Head ach, and then in another Moment, Memory returned, and every thing was pre&s;ent to me again.</P>
<P>I jump'd up upon my Feet in&s;tantly, and got hold of my Sword, but no Enemies in view: I found a <HI>Tartar</HI> lie dead and his Hor&s;e &s;tanding very quietly by him; and looking farther, I &s;aw my Champion and Deliverer, who had been to &s;ee what the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> had done, coming back with his Hanger in his Hand; the old Man &s;eeing me on my Feet, came running to me and embraced me with a great deal of Joy, being afraid before that I had been killed, and &s;eeing me bloody, would
<PB N="321" REF="330">
&s;ee how I was hurt, but it was not much, only what we call a broken Head; neither did I af|terwards find any great Inconvenience from the Blow, other than the Place which was hurt, and which was well again in two or three Days.</P>
<P>We made no great Gain however by this Vi|ctory, for we lo&s;t a Camel, and gained a Hor&s;e; but that which was remarkable, when we came back to the Village, the Man demanded to be paid for the Camel; I di&s;puted it, and it was brought to a hearing before the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Judge of the Place; that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> we went before a Ju&s;tice of the Peace: Give him his due, he acted with a great deal of Prudence and Im|partiality; and having heard both Sides, he gravely ask'd the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Man, that went with me to buy the Camel, who&s;e Servant he was? I am no Servant, &s;ays he, but went with the Stranger. At who&s;e Reque&s;t, &s;ays the Ju&s;tice? At the Stranger's Reque&s;t, &s;ays he. Why then, &s;ays the Ju&s;tice, you were the Stranger's Ser|vant for the Time, and the Camel being de|liver'd to his Servant, it was delivered to him, and he mu&s;t pay for it.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s the Thing was &s;o clear, that I had not a Word to &s;ay; but admiring to &s;ee &s;uch ju&s;t Rea&s;oning upon the Con&s;equence, and &s;o accu|rate &s;tating the Cau&s;e, I pay'd willingly for the Camel, and &s;ent for another; but you may ob|&s;erve, I &s;ent for it, I did not go to fetch it my &s;elf any more; I had enough of that.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Naum</HI> is a Frontier of the <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> Empire; they call it fortified, and &s;o it is, as Fortifications go there; for this I will venture
<PB N="322" REF="331">
to affirm, that all the <HI>Tartars</HI> in <HI>Karakathaie,</HI> which I believe, are &s;ome Millions, could not batter down the Walls with their Bows and Ar|rows; but to call it &s;trong, if it were attacked with Cannon, would be to make tho&s;e who un|der&s;tand it, laugh at you.</P>
<P>We wanted, as I have &s;aid, above two Days Journey of this City, when Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent Expre&s;s to every Part of the Road, to tell all Travellers and Caravans, to halt till they had a Guard &s;ent for them; for that an unu&s;ual Body of <HI>Tartars,</HI> making ten thou&s;and in all, had ap|peared in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond the City.</P>
<P>This was very bad News to Travellers; how|ever, it was carefully done of the Governour, and we were very glad to hear we &s;hould have a Guard; accordingly, two Days after, we had two hundred Soldiers &s;ent us from a Garri&s;on of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> on our left, and three hundred more from the City of <HI>Naum,</HI> and with tho&s;e we ad|vanced boldly; the three hundred Soldiers from <HI>Naum,</HI> march'd in our Front, the two hundred in our Rear, and our Men on each Side of our Camels with our Baggage, and the whole Cara|van in the Center; in this Order, and well pre|pared for Battle, we thought our &s;elves a Match for the whole ten thou&s;and <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> if they had appeared; but the next day when they did appear, it was quite another thing.</P>
<P>It was early in the Morning, when marching from a little well &s;ituated Town call'd <HI>Changu,</HI> we had a River to pa&s;s, where we were obliged to ferry; and had the <HI>Tartars</HI> had any Intelli|gence,
<PB N="323" REF="332">
then had been the Time to have attack'd us, when the Caravan being over, the Rear-Guard, was behind; but they did not appear.</P>
<P>About three Hours after, when we were en|ter'd upon a De&s;art of about fifteen or &s;ixteen Miles over, behold, by a Cloud of Du&s;t they rais'd, we &s;aw an Enemy was at Hand, and they were at Hand indeed, for they came on upon the Spur.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> our Guard on the Front, who had talk'd &s;o big the Day before, began to &s;tag|ger, and the Soldiers frequently look'd behind them, which is a certain Sign in a Soldier, that he is ju&s;t ready to run away; my old Pilot was of my mind, and being near me, he call'd out, Seignior <HI>Ingle&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, tho&s;e Fellows mu&s;t be encourag'd, or they will ruin us all; for if the <HI>Tartars</HI> come on, they will never &s;tand it: I am of your Mind, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but what Cour&s;e mu&s;t be done? Done! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> let fifty of our Men ad|vance, and flank them on each Wing, and en|courage them, and they will fight like brave Fellows in brave Company; but without, they will every man turn his back; immediately I rode up to our Leader, and told him, who was exactly of our mind; and accordingly, fifty of us march'd to the right Wing, and fifty to the left, and the re&s;t made a Line of Re&s;cue; and &s;o we march'd, leaving the la&s;t two hundred Men to make another Body by them&s;elves, and to guard the Camels; only that if need were, they &s;hould &s;end a hundred Men, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the la&s;t fifty.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="333">
In a word, the <HI>Tartars</HI> came on, and an in|numerable Company they were; how many, we could not tell, but ten thou&s;and we thought was the lea&s;t: A Party of them came on fir&s;t, and view'd our Po&s;ture, traver&s;ing the Ground in the Front of our Line; and as we found them within Gun-&s;hot, our Leader ordered the two Wings to advance &s;wiftly, and give them a Sal|vo on each Wing with their Shot, which was done; but they went off, and I &s;uppo&s;e back to give an Account of the Reception they were like to meet with: and indeed that Salute clogg'd their Stomach, for they immediately halt|ed, &s;tood a while to con&s;ider of it, and wheel|ing off to the left, they gave over the De&s;ign, and &s;aid no more to us for that time; which was very agreeable to our Circum&s;tances, which were but very indifferent for a Battel with &s;uch a Number.</P>
<P>Two Days after this, we came to the City <HI>Naun,</HI> or <HI>Naum;</HI> we thank'd the Governour for his Care for us, and collected to the Value of a hundred Crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the Soldiers &s;ent to guard us; and here we re&s;ted one Day. This is a Garri&s;on indeed, and there were nine hundred Soldiers kept here; but the Rea&s;on of it was, that formerly the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> having abandon'd that Part of the Country (which lies from this City We&s;t, for about two hundred Miles) as de&s;o|late and unfit for U&s;e; and more e&s;pecially, be|ing &s;o very remote, and &s;o difficult to &s;end Troops thither for its Defence; for we had yet above
<PB N="325" REF="334">
two thou&s;and Miles to <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> properly &s;o call'd.</P>
<P>After this, we pa&s;s'd &s;everal great Rivers, and two dreadful De&s;arts, one of which we were &s;ix|teen Days pa&s;&s;ing over, and which, as I &s;aid, was to be call'd <HI>no Man's Land;</HI> and on the 13th of <HI>April</HI> we came to the Frontiers of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Dominions: I think the fir&s;t City, or Town, or Fortre&s;s, whatever it might be call'd, that be|long'd to the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> was call'd <HI>Argun,</HI> being on the We&s;t Side of the River <HI>Argun.</HI></P>
<P>I could not but di&s;cover an infinite Satisfaction, that I was &s;o &s;oon arrived in, as I call'd it, a Chri|&s;tian Country, or at lea&s;t in a Country governed by Chri&s;tians; for tho' the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> do, <HI>in my Opinion,</HI> but ju&s;t de&s;erve the Name of Chri&s;tians, yet &s;uch they pretend to be, and are very devout in their Way: It would certainly occur to any Man who travels the World as I have done, and who had any Power of Reflection; I &s;ay, it would occur to him, to reflect what a Ble&s;&s;ing it is to be brought into the World, where the Name of God, and of a Redeemer is known, wor&s;hip'd and ador'd; and not where the People given up by Heaven to &s;trong Delu&s;ions, wor&s;hip the De|vil, and pro&s;trate them&s;elves to Stocks and Stones, wor&s;hip Mon&s;ters, Elements, horrible &s;haped Animals, and Statues, or Images of Mon|&s;ters: not a Town or City we pa&s;s'd thro', but had their Pagods, their Idols, and their Tem|ples, and ignorant People wor&s;hipping, even the Works of their own Hands.</P>
<P>Now we came where at lea&s;t a Face of the Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip appear'd, where the Knee was
<PB N="326" REF="335">
bow'd to Je&s;us; and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Chri&s;tian Religion was own'd, and the Name of the true God was call'd upon, and adored; and it made the very Rece&s;&s;es of my Soul rejoice to &s;ee it: I &s;aluted the brave <HI>Scots</HI> Mer|chant I mentioned above, with my fir&s;t acknow|ledgment of this; and taking him by the Hand, I &s;aid to him, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, we are once again come among Chri&s;tians: He &s;miled, and an|&s;wered, do not rejoice too &s;oon Countryman, the&s;e <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are but an odd &s;ort of Chri&s;tians; and but for the Name of it, you may &s;ee very little of the Sub&s;tance, for &s;ome Months farther of our Journey.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays I, but &s;till 'tis better than Pagani&s;m, and wor&s;hipping of Devils. Why, I'll tell you, &s;ays he, except the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Soldiers in Garri&s;ons, and a few of the Inhabitants of the Cities upon the Road, all the re&s;t of this Country, for above a thou&s;and Miles farther, is inhabited by the wor&s;t, and mo&s;t ignorant of Pagans; and &s;o in|deed we found it.</P>
<P>We were now launch'd into the greate&s;t Piece of &s;olid Earth, if I under&s;tand any thing of the Surface of the Globe, that is to be found in any Part of the Earth; we had at lea&s;t twelve hun|dred Miles to the Sea, Ea&s;tward; we had at lea&s;t two thou&s;and to the Bottom of the Bal|tick Sea, We&s;tward; and above three thou&s;and Miles, if we left that Sea, and went on We&s;t to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Channels: We had full five thou&s;and Miles to the <HI>Indian,</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Sea, South; and about eight hundred Miles to the Frozen Sea, North; nay, if &s;ome People may be believed, there might be no Sea North-Ea&s;t,
<PB N="327" REF="336">
till we came round the Pole, and con&s;equently into the North-We&s;t, and &s;o had a Continent of Land into <HI>America,</HI> the Lord knows where, tho' I could give &s;ome Rea&s;ons, why I believe that to be a Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>As we enter'd into the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Dominions, a good while before we came to any con&s;i|derable Towns, we had nothing to ob&s;erve there but this; fir&s;t, that all the Rivers that run to the Ea&s;t, as I under&s;tood by the Charts, which &s;ome in our Caravan had with them; it was plain, all tho&s;e Rivers ran into the Great River <HI>Ya|mour,</HI> or <HI>Gammour:</HI> This River, by the natural Cour&s;e of it mu&s;t run into the Ea&s;t Sea, or <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> Ocean. The Story they tell us, that the Month of this River, is choak'd up with Bull|ru&s;hes, of a mon&s;truous Growth, <HI>(viz.)</HI> three Foot about, and twenty or thirty Foot high, I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;ay, I believe nothing of; but as its Navigation is of no U&s;e, becau&s;e there is no Trade that way, the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, &s;o no Body that ever I heard of, has been curious enough, either to go down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from the Mouth of it in Ships; but this is certain, that this River run|ning due Ea&s;t, in the Latitude of car|ries a va&s;t Concour&s;e of Rivers along with it, and finds an Ocean to empty it &s;elf in that Lati|tude; &s;o we are &s;ure of Sea there.</P>
<P>Some Leagues to the North of this River, there are &s;everal con&s;iderable Rivers, who&s;e Streams run as due North as the <HI>Yamour</HI> runs Ea&s;t, and the&s;e are all found to join there Wa|ters with the Great River <HI>Tartarus,</HI> nam'd &s;o,

from the northernmo&s;t Nations of the <HI>Mongul Tar|tars,</HI> who the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> &s;ay, were the fir&s;t <HI>Tartars</HI> in the World; and who, as our Geographers alledge, are the <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> mention'd in &s;acred Story.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rivers running all Northward, as well as all the other Rivers, I am yet to &s;peak of, make it evident, that the Northern Ocean bounds the Land al&s;o on that &s;ide; &s;o that it does not &s;eem rational in the lea&s;t to think, that the Land can extend it &s;elf to join with <HI>America</HI> on that &s;ide, or that there is not a Communication between the Northern and the Ear&s;tern Ocean; but of this I &s;hall &s;ay no more, it was my Ob&s;ervation at that time, and therefore I take Notice of it in this Place. We now advanc'd from the River <HI>Arguna</HI> by ea&s;y and moderate Journeys, and were very vi&s;ibly oblig'd to the Care the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> has taken to have Cities and Town built in as many Places as are po&s;&s;ible to place them, where his Soldiers keep Garri&s;on &s;omething like the Stationary Soldi|ers plac'd by the <HI>Romans</HI> in the remote&s;t Countries of their Empire, &s;ome of which I had read particu|larly were plac'd in <HI>Britain</HI> for the Security of Com|merce, and for the lodging Travellers; and thus it was here; for where-ever we came, tho' at the&s;e Towns and Stations, the Garri&s;ons and Governor were <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> and profe&s;s'd Chri&s;tians, yet the Inhabitants of the Country were meer <HI>Pagans,</HI> &s;a|crificing to Idols, and wor&s;hipping the Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all the Ho&s;t of Heaven, and not only &s;o, but were of all the <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> that ever I met with, the mo&s;t barbarous, except only that they did not eat Man's Fle&s;h, as our Sa|vages of <HI>America</HI> did.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="338">
Some In&s;tances of this we met with in the Coun|try between <HI>Arguna,</HI> where we enter the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Dominions, and a City of <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> to|gether, call'd <HI>Nortziuskoy,</HI> in which is a continu'd De&s;art or Fore&s;t, which co&s;t us twenty Days to travel over it: in a Village near the la&s;t of tho&s;e Places I had the Curio&s;ity to go and &s;ee their Way of Living, which is mo&s;t bruti&s;h and un&s;ufferable; they had I &s;uppo&s;e a great Sacrifice that Day, for there &s;tood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, an Idol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, at lea&s;t as any Thing we can think of to repre&s;ent the Devil, can be made; it had a Head certainly not &s;o much as re&s;embling any Creature that the World ever &s;aw; Ears as big as Goats Horns, and as high; Eyes as big as a Crown-Piece; a No&s;e like a crook|ed Ram's Horn, and a Mouth extended four cor|ner'd, like that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, hooked like a Parrot's under Bill; it was dre&s;&s;ed up in the filthie&s;t manner that you could &s;uppo&s;e; its upper Garment was of Sheep-Skins, with the Wool outward, a great <HI>Tartar</HI> Bonnet on the Head, with two Horns growing through it; it was about eight Foot high, yet had no Feet or Legs, or any other Proportion of Parts.</P>

had been &s;o; but when I came a little nearer, they &s;tarted up upon their Feet, and rais'd a howling Cry, as if it had been &s;o many deep|mouth'd Hounds, and walk'd away as if they were di&s;pleas'd at our di&s;turbing them: A little way off from the I&s;land, and at the Door of that Tent or Hutt, made all of Sheep-Skins and Cow-Skins, dry'd, &s;tood three Butchers, I thought they were &s;uch; when I came nearer to them, I found they had long Knives in their Hands, and in the middle of the Tent ap|pear'd three Sheep kill'd, and one young Bul|lock or Steer: The&s;e it &s;eems, were Sacrifices to that &s;en&s;le&s;s Log of an Idol, and the&s;e three Men, Prie&s;ts belonging to it; and the &s;eventeen pro&s;trated Wretches, were the People who brought the Offering, and were making their Prayers to that Stock.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was more mov'd at their Stupidity and bruti&s;h Wor&s;hip of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at any Thing in my Life; to &s;ee God's mo&s;t glorious and be&s;t Creature, to whom he had granted &s;o many Advantages, <HI>even by Crea|tion,</HI> above the re&s;t of the Works of his Hands, ve&s;ted with a rea&s;onable Soul, and that Soul a|dorn'd with Faculties and Capacities, adapted both to honour his Maker, and be honoured by him, &s;unk and degenerated to a Degree &s;o more than &s;tupid, as to pro&s;trate it &s;elf to a frightful Nothing, a meer imaginary Object dre&s;s'd up by them|&s;elves, and made terrible to them&s;elves by their own Contrivance; adorn'd only with Clouts and Rags; and that this &s;hould be the Effect of meer Ig|norance, wrought up into helli&s;h Devotion by the Devil him&s;elf; who envying (to his Ma|ker) the Homage and Adoration of his Crea|tures,
<PB N="331" REF="340">
had deluded them into &s;uch gro&s;s, &s;urfeiting, &s;ordid and bruti&s;h things, as one would think &s;hould &s;hock Nature it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But what &s;ignify'd all the A&s;toni&s;hment and Re|flection of Thoughts; thus it was, and I &s;aw it before my Eyes, and there was no room to won|der at it, or think it impo&s;&s;ible; all my Admira|tion turn'd to Rage, and I rid up to the Image, or Mon&s;ter, call it what you will, and with my Sword cut the Bonnet that was on its Head in two in the middle, &s;o that it hung down by one of the Horns; and one of our Men that was with me took hold of the Sheep-Skin that cover'd it, and pull'd at it, when behold a mo&s;t hideous Outcry and Howling run thro' the Village, and two or three hundred People came about my Ears, &s;o that I was glad to &s;cour for it; for we &s;aw &s;ome had Bows and Arrows; but I re&s;olved from that moment to vi&s;it them again.</P>
<P>Our Caravan re&s;ted three Nights at the Town, which was about four Miles off, in order to pro|vide &s;ome Hor&s;es which they wanted, &s;everal of the Hor&s;es having been lam'd, and jaded with the badne&s;s of the Way and long March over the la&s;t De&s;art; &s;o we had &s;ome Lei&s;ure here to put my De&s;ign in Execution: I communicated my Project to the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> of who&s;e Courage I had had &s;ufficient Te&s;timony, as above: I told him what I had &s;een, and with what Indig|nation I had &s;ince thought that human Nature could be &s;o degenerate: I told him, I was re&s;olv'd if I could get but four or five Men well arm'd to go with me, I was re&s;olv'd to go and de&s;troy that vile, abominable Idol, and let them &s;ee that it had no Power to help it &s;elf, and con&s;equently could
<PB N="332" REF="341">
not be an Object of Wor&s;hip, or to be pray'd to, much le&s;s help them that offer'd Sacrifices to it.</P>
<P>He laugh'd at me; <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Your Zeal may be good, but what do you propo&s;e to your&s;elf by it? Propo&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to vindicate the Honour of God, which is in&s;ulted by this Devil Wor&s;hip. But how will it vindicate the Honour of God, <HI>&s;aid he?</HI> While the People will not be able to know what you mean by it, unle&s;s you could &s;peak to them and tell them &s;o, and then they will fight you, and beat you too, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, for they are de&s;pe|rate Fellows, and that e&s;pecially in Defence of their Idolatry. Can we not, &s;aid I, do it in the Night, and then leave them the Rea&s;ons and Cau&s;es in Writing in their own Language? Writing! &s;aid he, why there is not a Man in five Nations of them that know any thing of a Letter, or how to read a Word in any Language, or in their own, Wretched Ignorance! &s;aid I to him; however I have a great mind to do it; perhaps Nature may draw Inferences from it to them, to let them &s;ee how bruti&s;h they are, to wor&s;hip &s;uch horrid Things. Look you, Sir, &s;aid he, if your Zeal prompts you to it &s;o warmly, you mu&s;t do it; but in the next place I would have you con&s;ider, the&s;e wild Nations of People are &s;ubjected by Force to the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Dominions, and if you do this, 'tis ten to one but they will come by Thou|&s;ands to the Governour of <HI>Nert&s;inskay,</HI> and com|plain, and demand Satisfaction; and if he cannot give them Satisfaction, 'tis ten to one but they revolt, and it will occa&s;ion a new War with all the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the Country.</P>
<P>This, I confe&s;s, put new Thoughts into my Head for a while; but I harp'd upon the &s;ame
<PB N="333" REF="342">
String &s;till, and all that Day I was unea&s;y to put my Project in Execution: Towards the Evening the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant met me by Accident in our Walk about the Town, and de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with me; I believe, &s;aid he, I have put you off of your good De&s;ign; I have been a little concern'd about it &s;ince, for I abhor the Idol and the Idolatry as much as you can do: Truly, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you have put it off a little as to the Execution of it, but you have not put it all out of my Thoughts, and I believe I &s;hall do it &s;till before I quit this Place, tho' I were to be deliver'd up to them fot Sati&s;|faction. No, no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> God forbid they &s;hould deliver you up to &s;uch a Crew of Mon&s;ters; they &s;hall not do that neither, that would be murdering you indeed. Why, &s;ays I, how would they u&s;e me? U&s;e you! &s;ays he; I'll tell you how they &s;erv'd a poor <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian,</HI> who affronted them in their Wor|&s;hip ju&s;t as you did, and who they took Pri&s;oner; after they had lam'd him with an Arrow that he could not run away, they took him and &s;tripp'd him &s;tark naked, and &s;et him up on the top of the Idol Mon&s;ter, and &s;tood all round him, and &s;hot as many Arrows into him as would &s;tick over his whole Body, and then they burnt him and all the Arrows &s;ticking in him as a Sacrifice to the Idol. And was this the &s;ame Idol? Yes, &s;ays he, the very &s;ame. Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I'll tell you a Story; &s;o I related the Story of our Men at <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and how they burnt and &s;ack'd the Village there, and kill'd Man, Woman and Child, for their mur|dering one of our Men, ju&s;t as it is related before; and when I had done, I added, that I thought we ought to do &s;o to this Village.</P>
<P>He li&s;ten'd very attentively to the Story; but when I talk'd of doing &s;o to that Village, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="343">
You mi&s;take very much, it was not this Village, it was almo&s;t a hundred Mile from this place, but it was the &s;ame Idol, for they carry him about in Proce&s;&s;ion all over the Country: Well, then, &s;ays I, then that Idol ought to be puni&s;h'd for it, and it &s;hall, &s;ays I, if I live this Night out.</P>
<P>In a word, finding me re&s;olute, he lik'd the De&s;ign, and told me I &s;hould not go alone, but he would go with me, and bring a &s;tout Fellow, one of his Countrymen, to go al&s;o with us; and one, &s;ays he, as famous for his Zeal as you can de&s;ire any one to be, again&s;t &s;uch Devili&s;h things as the&s;e. In a word, he brought me his Comrade, a <HI>Scots</HI> Man, who he call'd Captain <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> and I gave him a full account of what I had &s;een; and in a word, of what I intended; and he told me readily, he would go with me if it co&s;t him his Life; &s;o we agreed to go only us three. I had indeed propos'd it to my Partner, but he declin'd it; he &s;aid, he was ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t me to the ut|mo&s;t, and upon all occa&s;ions for my defence; but that this was an Adventure quite out of his way; &s;o, I &s;ay, we re&s;olv'd upon our Work only us three and my Man-Servant, and to put it in Exe|cution that Night about Midnight, with all the Secrecy imaginable.</P>
<P>However, upon &s;econd Thoughts, we were willing to delay it till the next Night, becau&s;e the Caravan being to &s;et forward in the Morning, we &s;uppos'd the Governour could not pretend to give them any Satisfaction upon us when we were out of his Power. The <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant, as &s;teady in his Re&s;olution for the Enterprize, as bold in executing, brought me a <HI>Tartar</HI>'s Robe or Gown of the Sheep-Skins, and a Bonnet, with
<PB N="335" REF="344">
a Bow and Arrows, and had provided the &s;ame for him&s;elf and his Countryman, that the People, if they &s;aw us, &s;hould not be able to determine who we were.</P>
<P>All the fir&s;t Night we &s;pent in mixing up &s;ome combu&s;tible Matter with Aqua-vitae, Gun-powder, and &s;uch other Materials as we could get, and ha|ving a good Quantity of Tar in a little Pot, a|bout an Hour after Night we &s;et out upon our Expedition.</P>
<P>We came to the Place about eleven a Clock at Night, and found that the People had not the lea&s;t Jealou&s;y of Danger attending their Idol; the Night was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light enough to &s;ee that the Idol &s;tood ju&s;t in the &s;ame Po&s;ture and Place that it did before: The People &s;eemed to be all at their Re&s;t, only, that in the great Hutt, or Tent, as we called it, where we &s;aw the three Prie&s;ts, who we mi&s;took for Butch|ers, we &s;aw a Light, and going up clo&s;e to the Door, we heard People talking, as if there were five or &s;ix of them; we concluded therefore, that if we &s;et the Wild-fire to the Idol, the&s;e Men would come out immediately, and run up to the Place to re&s;cue it from the De&s;truction that we intended for it, and what to do with them we knew not; once we thought of carrying it away and &s;etting Fire to it at a Di&s;tance; but when we came to handle it, we found it it too bulky for our Carriage, &s;o we were at a Lo&s;s again: The &s;econd <HI>Scots</HI> Man was for &s;etting Fire to the Tent or Hutt, and knocking the Creatures that were there on the Head when they came out; but I could not joyn with that; I was again&s;t killing them, if it was po&s;&s;ible to be avoided: Well then, &s;aid the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant, I'll
<PB N="336" REF="345">
tell you what we will do, we will try to take them Pri&s;oners, tye their Hands behind them, and make them &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ee their Idol de|&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>As it happen'd, we had Twine or Packthread enough about us, which was u&s;ed to tye our Fire-Works together with; &s;o we re&s;olved to attack the&s;e People fir&s;t, and with as little Noi&s;e as we could: The fir&s;t Thing we did, we knocked at the Door, which i&s;&s;ued ju&s;t as we de&s;ired it; for one of their Idol Prie&s;ts came to the Door: we imme|diately &s;eized upon him, &s;top'd his Mouth, and ty'd his Hands behind him, and led him to the Idol, where we gagg'd him, that he might not make a Noi&s;e; ty'd his Feet al&s;o together, and left him on the Ground.</P>
<P>Two of us then waited at the Door, expe|cting that another would come out to &s;ee what the Matter was; but we waited &s;o long 'till the third Man came back to us; and then no Body coming out, we knock'd again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we &s;erved them ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, but was oblig'd to go all with them, and lay them down by the Idol &s;ome Di&s;tance from one another; when go|ing back, we found two more were come out to the Door, and a third &s;tood behind them within the Door: We &s;eiz'd the two, and immediately ty'd them, when the third &s;tepping back, and crying out, my <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant went in after him, and taking out a Compo&s;ition we had made, that would only &s;moke and &s;tink, he &s;et Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that Time the other <HI>Scots</HI> Man and my Man taking Charge of the two Men who were already bound, and ty'd together
<PB N="337" REF="346">
al&s;o by the Arm, led them away to the Idol, and left them there, to &s;ee if their Idol would relieve them, making ha&s;t back to us.</P>
<P>When the Fuze we had thrown in had fill'd the Hutt with &s;o much Smoak, that they were al|mo&s;t &s;uffocated, we then threw in a &s;mall Leather Bag of another kind, which flam'd like a Can|dle, and following it in, we found there was but four People left, who, it &s;eems, were two Men and two Women, and, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, had been a|bout &s;ome of their Diabolick Sacrifices: They appear'd, in &s;hort, frighted to Death, at lea&s;t &s;o as to &s;it trembling and &s;tupid, and not able to &s;peak neither, for the Smoak.</P>
<P>In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the other, and all without any Noi&s;e: I &s;hould have &s;aid, we brought them out of the Hou&s;e or Hutt fir&s;t; for indeed we were not able to bear the Smoak any more than they were. When we had done this, we carry'd them all together to the Idol: when we came there, we fell to work with him; and fir&s;t we daub'd him all over, and his Robes al&s;o, with Tar and &s;uch other Stuff as we had, which was Tallow mix'd with Brim&s;tone; then we &s;topp'd his Eyes, and Ears, and Mouth full of Gun-Powder, and then we wrapp'd up a great piece of Wild-fire in his Bonnet, and then &s;ticking all the Combu&s;tibles we had brought with us upon him, we look'd about to &s;ee if we could find any thing el&s;e to help to burn him, when my Man remembred, that by the Tent or Hutt where the Men were, there lay a heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Ru&s;hes I do not re|member; away he and one of the <HI>Scots</HI> Men run, and fetch'd their Arms full of that: When we had
<PB N="338" REF="347">
done this, we took all our Pri&s;oners, and brought them, having unty'd their Feet, and ungagg'd their Mouths, and made them &s;tand up, and &s;et them ju&s;t before their mon&s;trous Idol, and then &s;et fire to the whole.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd by it a quarter of an Hour, or there|abouts, 'till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, and Ears of the Idol blew up, and we could per|ceive had &s;plit and deformed the Shape; and in a word, 'till we &s;aw it burn into a meer Block or Log of Wood, and then &s;etting the dry Forage to it, we found it would be quite con&s;um'd, when we began to think of going away; but the <HI>Scots</HI> Man &s;aid no, we mu&s;t not go, for the&s;e poor de|luded Wretches will all throw them&s;elves into the Fire, and burn them&s;elves with the Idol; &s;o we re&s;olved to &s;tay 'till the Forage was burnt down too, and then we came away and left them.</P>
<P>In the Morning we appear'd among our Fel|low Travellers exceeding bu&s;y, in getting ready for our Journey; nor could any Man &s;ugge&s;t that we had been any where but in our Beds, as Tra|vellers might be &s;uppos'd to be, to fit them&s;elves for the Fatigues of that Day's Journey.</P>
<P>But it did not end &s;o; the next Day came a great Multitude of the Country People, not on|ly of this Village, but of a hundred more, for ought I know, to the Town-Gates, and in a mo&s;t outragious manner, demanded Satisfa|ction of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Governour, for the in&s;ult|ing their Prie&s;ts, and burning their Great <HI>Cham-Chi-Thaungu,</HI> &s;uch a hard Name they gave the mon&s;trous Creature they wor&s;hip'd; the People of <HI>Nert&s;inskay,</HI> were at fir&s;t in a great Con&s;terna|tion,
<PB N="339" REF="348">
for they &s;aid, the <HI>Tartars</HI> were no le&s;s than thirty thou&s;and, and that in a few days more, would be one hundred thou&s;and &s;trong.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Governour &s;ent out Me&s;&s;engers to appea&s;e them, and gave them all the good words imaginable: He a&s;&s;ured them, he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a Soul of his Gar|ri&s;on been abroad: that it could not be from any body there; and if they would let him know who it was, they &s;hould be examplarily puni&s;hed. They return'd haughtily, that all the Country reverenced the Great <HI>Cham-Chi-Thaungu,</HI> who dwelt in the Sun, and no Mortal would have decreed to offer Violence to his Image, but &s;ome Chri&s;tian Mi&s;creant, &s;o they call'd them it &s;eems; and they therefore denounc'd War again&s;t him, and all the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> who, they &s;aid, were Mi&s;|creants and Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Governour &s;till patient, and unwilling to make a Breach, or to have any Cau&s;e of War alledged to be given by him, the Czar having &s;traitly charged them to treat the con|quer'd Country with Gentlene&s;s and Civility, gave them &s;till all the good Words he could; at la&s;t he told them, there was a <HI>Caravan</HI> gone towards <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> that Morning, and perhaps it was &s;ome of them, who had done them this In|jury; and that if they would be &s;atisfied with that, he would &s;end after them, to enquire into it: This &s;eem'd to appea&s;e them a little; and accordingly the Governour &s;ent after us, and gave us a particular Account how the Thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our Caravan had done it, they &s;hould make their E&s;cape; but that whether they had done it or no,
<PB N="340" REF="349">
we &s;hould make all the ha&s;t forward that was po&s;|&s;ible; and that in the mean time, he would keep them in play as long as he could.</P>
<P>This was very friendly in the Governour; however, when it came to the Caravan, there was no Body knew any Thing of the Matter; and as for us that were guilty, we were the lea&s;t of all &s;u&s;pected; none &s;o much as ask'd us the Que&s;tion; however, the Captain of the Caravan for the Time, took the Hint that the Governour gave us, and we marched or travelled two Days and two Nights, without any con&s;iderable Stop; and then we lay at a Village called <HI>Plothus;</HI> nor did make any long Stop here, but ha&s;ten'd on towards <HI>Jarawena,</HI> another of the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Colonies, and where we expected we &s;hould be &s;afe; but it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that here we began for two or three Days march, to enter upon the va&s;t namele&s;s De&s;art, of which I &s;hall &s;ay more in its Place; and which, if we had now been up|on it, 'tis more than probable, we had been all de&s;troy'd: It was the &s;econd Day's march from <HI>Plothus,</HI> that by the Clouds of Du&s;t behind us at a great Di&s;tance, &s;ome of our People began to be &s;en&s;ible we were pur&s;ued; we had enter'd the De&s;art, and had pa&s;s'd by a great Lake call'd <HI>Schaks-O&s;er</HI> when we perceiv'd a very great Bo|dy of Hor&s;e appear on the other Side of the Lake to the North, we travelling We&s;t: We ob&s;erv'd they went away We&s;t as we did, but had &s;uppo&s;ed we would have taken that Side of the Lake, whereas, we very happily took the South Side; and in two Days more, we &s;aw them not, for they believing we were &s;till be|fore them, pu&s;h'd on till they came to the Ri|ver
<PB N="341" REF="350">
<HI>Udda;</HI> this is a very great River when it pa&s;&s;es farther North; but where we came to it, we found it narrow, and fordable.</P>
<P>The third Day they either found their Mi|&s;take, or had Intelligence of us, and came pour|ing in upon us, towards the Dusk of the Even|ing: We had, to our great Satisfaction, ju&s;t pitch'd upon a Place for our Camp, which was very convenient for the Night; for as we were up|on a De&s;art, tho' but at the beginning of it, that was above five hundred Miles over, we had no Towns to lodge at, and indeed expected none but the City <HI>Jarawena,</HI> which we had yet two Days march to; the De&s;art however, had &s;ome few Woods in it on this Side, and little Rivers, which ran all into the great River <HI>Udda:</HI> It was in a narrow Strait between two little, but very thick Woods, that we pitch'd our little Camp for that Night, expecting to be attack'd in the Night.</P>
<P>No body knew but our&s;elves, what we were pur&s;ued for; but as it was u&s;ual for the <HI>Mongul Tartars</HI> to go about in Troops in that De&s;art, &s;o the Caravans always fortify them&s;elves every Night again&s;t them, as again&s;t Armies of Rob|bers; and it was therefore no new thing to be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>But we had this Night, of all the Nights of our Travels, a mo&s;t advantageous Camp; for we lay between two Woods, with a little Rivu|let running ju&s;t before our Front; &s;o that we could not be &s;urrounded, or attack'd any way, but in our Front or Rear; we took care al&s;o to make our Front as &s;trong as we could, by
<PB N="342" REF="351">
placing our Packs, with our Camels and Hor|&s;es, all in a Line on the In&s;ide of the River, and felling &s;ome Trees in our Rear.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture we encamp'd for the Night, but the Enemy was upon us before we had fi|ni&s;h'd our Situation: They did not come on us like Thieves as we expected, but &s;ent three Me&s;&s;en|gers to us, to demand the Men to be delivered to them, that had abus'd their Prie&s;ts, and burn'd their God, <HI>Cham-Chi-Thaungu</HI> with Fire, that they might burn them with Fire; and upon this, they &s;aid they would go away, and do us no farther harm, otherwi&s;e, they would burn us all with Fire. Our Men look'd very blank at this Me&s;&s;age, and began to &s;tare at one ano|ther, to &s;ee who look'd with mo&s;t Guilt in their Faces; but <HI>no Body</HI> was the Word, no Body did it. The Leader of the Caravan &s;ent Word, he was well a&s;&s;ur'd, it was not done by any of our Camp; that we were peaceable Merchants, tra|velling on our Bu&s;ine&s;s; that we had done no harm to them, or to any one el&s;e; and that therefore, they mu&s;t look farther for their Ene|mies who had injur'd them, for we were not the People; &s;o de&s;ir'd them not to di&s;turb us, for if they did, we &s;hould defend our &s;elves.</P>
<P>They were far from being &s;atisfy'd with this for an An&s;wer, but a great Crowd of them came down in the Morning by break of Day to our Camp; but &s;eeing us in &s;uch an unaccountable Situation, they dur&s;t come no farther than the Brook in our Front, where they &s;tood and &s;hew'd us &s;uch a Number, that indeed terrify'd us very much; for tho&s;e that &s;poke lea&s;t of them, &s;poke of ten thou&s;and: here they &s;tood and look'd

at us a while, and then &s;etting up a great Howl, they let fly a Cloud of Arrows among us; but we were well enough fortified for that; for we &s;helter'd under our Baggage, and I do not re|member that one Man of us was hurt.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, we &s;ee them move a little to our Right, and expected them on the Rear, when a cunning Fellow, a <HI>Co&s;&s;ack,</HI> as they call them, of <HI>Jarawena,</HI> in the Pay of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> calling to the Leader of the Caravan, &s;aid to him, I'll go &s;end all the&s;e People away to <HI>Siheilka;</HI> this was a City, four or five Days Journey at lea&s;t to the South, and rather behind us: &s;o he takes his Bow and Arrows, and getting on Hor&s;e-back, he rides away from our Rear directly, as it were back to <HI>Nerts&s;inskay;</HI> after this, he takes a great Circuit about, and comes to the Army of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as if he had been &s;ent Expre&s;s to tell them a long Story; that the People who had burnt the <HI>Cham-Chi-Thaungu,</HI> were gone to <HI>Siheilka,</HI> with a Caravan of Mi&s;creants, as he call'd them, that is to &s;ay, Chri&s;tians; and that they had re|&s;olv'd to burn the God <HI>Schal-I&s;ar,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Tongue&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>As this Fellow was him&s;elf a meer <HI>Tartar,</HI> and perfectly &s;poke their Language, he counterfeited &s;o well, that they all took it from him, and away they drove in a mo&s;t violent Hurry to <HI>Siheilka,</HI> which it &s;eems was five Days Journey to the North, and in le&s;s than three Hours, they were entirely out of our Sight, and we never heard any more of them; and we never knew whether they went to that other Place called <HI>Si|heilka,</HI> or no.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="353">
So we pa&s;s'd &s;afely on to the City of <HI>Jarawena,</HI> where there was a Garri&s;on of <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and there we re&s;ted five Days, the Caravan being ex|ceedingly fatigued with the la&s;t Day's hard march, and with want of Re&s;t in the Night.</P>
<P>From this City we had a frightful De&s;art, which held us three and twenty Days march: We furni&s;h'd our &s;elves with &s;ome Tents here, for the better accommodating our &s;elves in the Night; and the Leader of the Caravan, procu|red &s;ixteen Carriages or Waggons of the Coun|try, for carrying our Water and Provi&s;ions, and the&s;e Carriages were our Defence every Night round our little Camp; &s;o that had the <HI>Tartars</HI> appeared, unle&s;s they had been very numerous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us.</P>
<P>We may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to want Re&s;t again after this long Journey; for in this De&s;art we &s;aw neither Hou&s;e or Tree, or &s;carce a Bu&s;h; we &s;aw abundance of the Sable-Hunters, as they call'd them: The&s;e are all <HI>Tartars</HI> of the <HI>Mongul Tartary,</HI> of which this County is a part, and they frequently attack &s;mall Caravans, but we &s;aw no Numbers of them together: I was curious to &s;ee the Sable Skins they catched, but could never &s;peak with any of them, for they dur&s;t not come near us, neither dur&s;t we &s;traggle from our Com|pany, to go near them.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;s'd this De&s;art, we came in|to a Country pretty well inhabited; that is to &s;ay, we found Towns and Ca&s;tles, &s;ettled by the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> with Garri&s;ons of Stationa|ry
<PB N="345" REF="354">
Soldiers to protect the Caravans, and defend the Country again&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who would other|wi&s;e make it very dangerous travelling; and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty has given &s;uch &s;trict Orders for the well guarding the Caravans and Merchants, that if there are any <HI>Tartars</HI> heard of in the Country, Detachments of the Garri&s;ons are al|ways &s;ent to &s;ee the Travellers &s;afe from Station to Station.</P>
<P>And thus the Governour of <HI>Adinskoy,</HI> who I had Opportunity to make a Vi&s;it to, by means of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant who was acquainted with him, offer'd us a Guard of fifty Men, if we thought there was any Danger to the next Station.</P>
<P>I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to <HI>Europe</HI> we &s;hould find the Country better peopled, and the People more civiliz'd, but I found my &s;elf mi&s;taken in both, for we had yet the Na|tion of the <HI>Tongue&s;es</HI> to pa&s;s through; where we &s;aw the &s;ame Tokens of Pagani&s;m and Barbarity, or wor&s;e, than before, only as they were conquer'd by the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and entirely reduc'd, they were not &s;o dangerous; but for Rudene&s;s of Manners, Idolatry, and Multithei&s;m no People in the World ever went beyond them: They are cloath'd all in Skins of Bea&s;ts, and their Hou&s;es are built of the &s;ame: You know not a Man from a Woman, nei|ther by the Ruggedne&s;s of their Countenances or their Cloaths; and in the Winter, when the Ground is cover'd with Snow, they live under Ground in Hou&s;es like Vaults, which have Cavities going from one to another.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Tartars</HI> had their <HI>Cham-Chi-Tongu</HI> for a whole Village or Country, the&s;e had Idols in eve|ry
<PB N="346" REF="355">
Hutt and in every Cave; be&s;ides, they wor&s;hip the Stars, the Sun, the Water, the Snow, and in a word, every thing that they do not under&s;tand, and they under&s;tand but very little; &s;o that almo&s;t every Element, every uncommon thing, &s;ets them a &s;acrificing.</P>
<P>But I am no more to de&s;cribe People than Coun|tries, any farther than my own Story comes to be concerned in them: I met with nothing peculiar to my &s;elf in all this Country, which I reckon was from the De&s;art which I &s;poke of la&s;t, at lea&s;t 400 Miles, half of it being another De&s;art, which took us up twelve Days &s;evere travelling, without Hou&s;e, or Tree, or Bu&s;h, but were oblig'd again to carry our own Provi&s;ions, as well Water as Bread. After we were out of this De&s;art, and had travell'd two Days, we came to <HI>Janezay,</HI> a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> City or Station, on the great River <HI>Jane|zay:</HI> this River they told us parted <HI>Europe</HI> from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> tho' our Map-makers, as I am told, do not a gree to it; however, it is certainly the Ea&s;tern Boundary of the ancient <HI>Siberia,</HI> which now makes up a Province only of the va&s;t <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Empire, but is it &s;elf equal in Bigne&s;s to the whole Empire of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>And yet here I ob&s;erv'd Ignorance and Pagani&s;m &s;till prevailed, except in the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Garri&s;ons; all the Country between the River <HI>Oby</HI> and the River <HI>Janezay</HI> is as entirely Pagan, and the People as barbarous, as the remote&s;t of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> nay, as any Nation for ought I know in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> or <HI>America:</HI> I al&s;o found, which I ob&s;erv'd to the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Governours who I had Opportunity to conver&s;e with, that the poor Pagans are not much the wi&s;er or the nearer Chri&s;tianity for being under the <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI>
<PB N="347" REF="356">
Government; which they acknowledg'd was true enough, but, as they &s;aid, was none of their Bu&s;ine&s;s: That if the Czar expected to convert his <HI>Siberian,</HI> or <HI>Tongue&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Tartar</HI> Subjects, it &s;hould be done by &s;ending Clergymen among them, not Soldiers; and they added, with more Sincerity than I expected, that they found it was not &s;o much the Concern of their Monarch to make the People Chri&s;tians, as it was to make them Subjects.</P>
<P>From this River to the great River <HI>Oby,</HI> we cro&s;s'd a wild uncultivated Country: I cannot &s;ay 'tis a barren Soil; 'tis only barren of People, and good Management, otherwi&s;e it is in it&s;elf a mo&s;t plea&s;ant, fruitful and agreeable Country: What Inhabitants we found in it are all Pagans, except &s;uch as are &s;ent among them from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> for this is the Country I mean on both &s;ides the River <HI>Oby,</HI> whither the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Criminals, that are not put to Death, are bani&s;h'd, and from whence it is next to impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever come away.</P>
<P>I have nothing material to &s;ay of my particular Affairs, till I came to <HI>Tobolski,</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Siberia,</HI> where I continued &s;ome time on the following Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>We had been now almo&s;t &s;even Months on our Journey, and Winter began to come on apace; whereupon my Partner and I call'd a Council a|bout our particular Affairs, in which we found it proper, con&s;idering that we were bound for <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and not for <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> to con&s;ider how to di&s;|po&s;e of our &s;elves: They told us of Sledges and Rane Deer to carry us over the Snow in the Win|ter time; and indeed they have &s;uch things, that it
<PB N="348" REF="357">
would be incredible to relate the Particulars of, by which means the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> travel more in the Win|ter than they can in Summer, becau&s;e in the&s;e Sleds they are able to run Night and Day; the Snow being frozen, is one univer&s;al Covering to Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales, the Rivers, the Lakes, all are &s;mooth, and hard as a Stone, and they run upon the Surface, without any regard to what is underneath.</P>
<P>But I had no occa&s;ion to pu&s;h at a Winter Journey of this kind: I was bound to <HI>England,</HI> not to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and my Rout lay two ways, either I mu&s;t go on as the Caravan went till I came to <HI>Jero&s;law,</HI> and then go off We&s;t for <HI>Narva,</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Finland;</HI> and &s;o either by Sea or Land to <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where I might po&s;&s;ibly &s;ell my <HI>China</HI> Cargo to good Advantage, or I mu&s;t leave the Caravan at a little Town on the <HI>Dwi|na,</HI> from whence I had but &s;ix Days by Water to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> and from thence might be &s;ure of Ship|ping, either to <HI>England, Holland,</HI> or <HI>Hamburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Now to go any of the&s;e Journeys in the Winter, would ha'been prepo&s;terous; for as to <HI>Dantzick,</HI> the <HI>Baltick</HI> would be frozen up, and I could not get Pa&s;&s;age, and to go by Land in tho&s;e Countries, was far le&s;s &s;afe than among the <HI>Mongul Tartars;</HI> likewi&s;e to go to <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> in <HI>October,</HI> all the Ships would be gone from thence, and even the Merchants who dwell there in Summer, retire South to <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> in the Winter when the Ships are gone; &s;o that I &s;hould have nothing but Ex|tremity of Cold to encounter, with a Scarcity of Provi&s;ions, and mu&s;t lie there in an empty Town all the Winter: &s;o that upon the whole I thought it much my better way to let the Cara|van
<PB N="349" REF="358">
go, and to make Provi&s;ion to Winter where I was, <HI>(viz.)</HI> at <HI>Tobolski</HI> in <HI>Siberia,</HI> in the Lati|tude of Degrees, where I was &s;ure of three Things to wear out a cold Winter with, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Plenty of Provi&s;ion &s;uch as the Country afforded; a warm Hou&s;e, with Fuel enough, and excellent Company; of all which I &s;hall give a full Account in its Place.</P>
<P>I was now in a quite different Climate from my belov'd I&s;land, where I never felt Cold except when I had my Ague; on the contrary, I had much to do to bear any Cloaths on my Back, and never made any Fire but without doors, and for my nece&s;&s;ity in dre&s;&s;ing my Food, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now I made me three good Ve&s;ts, with large Robes or Gowns over them to hang down to the Feet, and button clo&s;e to the Wri&s;ts, and all the&s;e lin'd with Furs to make them &s;ufficiently warm.</P>
<P>As to a warm Hou&s;e, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I greatly di&s;lik'd our way in <HI>England</HI> of making Fires in every Room in the Hou&s;e, in open Chimneys, which when the Fire was out, always kept the Air in the Room cold as the Climate: But taking an Appartment in a good Hou&s;e in the Town, I order'd a Chimney to be built like a Furnace, in the Center of &s;ix &s;everal Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel to carry the Smoak went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire went in another, and all the Rooms were kept equally warm, but no Fire &s;een; ju&s;t as they heat the Bagnios in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>By this means we had always the &s;ame Climate in all the Rooms, and an equal Heat was pre&s;erv'd; and how cold &s;oever it was without, it was al|ways
<PB N="350" REF="359">
ways warm within, and yet we &s;aw no Fire, nor was ever incommoded with any Smoke.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t wonderful thing of all was, that it &s;hould be po&s;&s;ible to meet with good Company here, in a Country &s;o barbarous as that of the mo&s;t Northerly Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> near the frozen Ocean, and within but a very few Degrees of <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI></P>
<P>But this being the Country where the State Criminals of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> as I ob&s;erv'd before, are all bani&s;h'd, this City was full of Noblemen, Princes, Gentlemen, Colonels, and in &s;hort all Degrees of the Nobility, Gentry, Soldiery and Courtiers of <HI>Mu&s;covy:</HI> Here was the famous Prince <HI>Galliozen,</HI> the old General <HI>Robo&s;tiski,</HI> and &s;everal other Per|&s;ons of note, and &s;ome Ladies.</P>
<P>By means of my <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant, who neverthe|le&s;s I parted with here, I made an Acquaintance here with &s;everal of the&s;e Gentlemen, and &s;ome of them of the fir&s;t Rank, and from the&s;e in the long Winter Nights in which I &s;tay'd here, I receiv'd &s;everal very agreeable Vi&s;its: It was talking one Night with Prince..... one of the bani&s;h'd Mini&s;ters of State belonging to the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI> that my Talk of my particular Ca&s;e began: He had been telling me abundance of fine Things of the Greatne&s;s, the Magnificence, the Domi|nions, and the ab&s;olute Power of the Emperor of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians.</HI> I interrupted him, and told him I was a greater and more powerful Prince than ever the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> was, tho' my Dominions were not &s;o large, or my People &s;o many. The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Grandee</HI> look'd a little &s;urpriz'd, and fixing
<PB N="351" REF="360">
his Eyes &s;teddily upon me, began to wonder what I meant.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> his Wonder would cea&s;e when I had explain'd my&s;elf: Fir&s;t, <HI>I told him,</HI> I had the ab|&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of the Lives and Fortunes of all my Subjects: That notwith&s;tanding my ab&s;olute Power, I had not one Per&s;on di&s;affected to my Government, or to my Per&s;on, in all my Domi|nions. He &s;hook his Head at that, and &s;aid, there indeed I outdid the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy. I told him,</HI> That all the Lands in my Kingdom were my own, and all my Subjects were not only my Tenants, but Tenants at Will: That they would all fight for me to the la&s;t Drop; and that never Tyrant, <HI>for &s;uch I acknowledged my&s;elf to be,</HI> was ever &s;o univer&s;ally beloved, and yet &s;o horribly feared by his Subjects.</P>
<P>After amu&s;ing them with the&s;e Riddles in Go|vernment for a while, I open'd the Ca&s;e, and told them the Story at large of my living in the I&s;land, and how I managed both my&s;elf and the People there that were under me, ju&s;t as I have &s;ince mi|nuted it down. They were exceedingly taken with the Story, and e&s;pecially the Prince, who told me with a Sigh, that the true Greatne&s;s of Life was to be Ma&s;ter of our&s;elves: That he would not have exchanged &s;uch a State of Life as mine, to have been Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> and that he found more Felicity in the Retirement he &s;eem'd to be bani&s;h'd to there, than ever he found in the high|e&s;t Authority he enjoy'd in the Court of his Ma&s;ter the Czar: That the Heighth of human Wi&s;dom was to bring our Tempers down to our Circum|&s;tances; and to make a Calm within, under the Weight of the greate&s;t Scorns without. When he
<PB N="352" REF="361">
came fir&s;t hither, he &s;aid he u&s;ed to tear the Hair from his Head, and the Cloaths from his Back, as others had done before him; but a little Time and Con&s;ideration had made him look into him&s;elf, as well as round him to things without: That he found the Mind of Man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the State of univer&s;al Life, and how little this World was concern'd in its true Felicity, was perfectly capable of making a Fe|licity for it&s;elf, fully &s;atisfying to it&s;elf, and &s;uitable to its own be&s;t Ends and De&s;ires, with but very little A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the World: That Air to breath in, Food to &s;u&s;tain Life, Cloaths for Warmth, and Liberty for Exerci&s;e in order to Health, compleated, in his Opinion, all that the World could do for us; and tho' the Greatne&s;s, the Authority, the Riches, and the Plea&s;ures which &s;ome enjoy'd in the World, and which he had enjoy'd his Share of, had much in them that was agreeable to us; yet he ob&s;erv'd that all tho&s;e things chiefly gratify'd the coar&s;e&s;t of our Affe|ctions, &s;uch as our Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice, our Vanity, and our Sen&s;uality; all which were indeed the meer Product of the wor&s;t part of Man, were in them&s;elves Crimes, and had in them the Seeds of all manner of Crimes, but neither were related to, or concern'd with any of tho&s;e Virtues that con&s;tituted us wi&s;e Men, or of tho&s;e Graces which di&s;tingui&s;h'd us as Chri|&s;tians: That being now deprived of all the fancy'd Felicity which he enjoy'd in the full Exerci&s;e of all tho&s;e Vices, he &s;aid he was at lei&s;ure to look upon the dark Side of them, where he found all manner of Deformity, and was now convinced, that Virtue only makes a Man truly wi&s;e, rich, and great, and pre&s;erves him in the way to a &s;u|perior Happine&s;s in a future State. And in this
<PB N="353" REF="362">
he &s;aid, they were more happy in their Bani&s;h|ment, than all their Enemies were, who had the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Wealth and Power that they (the Bani&s;h'd) had left behind them.</P>
<P>Nor, Sir, &s;ays he, do I bring my Mind to this politically, by the Nece&s;&s;ity of my Circum&s;tances, which &s;ome call mi&s;erable; but if I know any thing of my &s;elf, I would not now go back, tho' the Czar, my Ma&s;ter, &s;hould call me, and re-in&s;tate me in all my former Grandeur; I &s;ay, I would no more go back to it, than I believe my Soul, when it &s;hall be deliver'd from this Pri&s;on of the Body, and has had a Ta&s;te of the glorious State beyond Life, would come back to the Jayl of Fle&s;h and Blood it is now enclos'd in, and leave Heaven to deal in the Dirt and Crime of human Affairs.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this with &s;o much Warmth in his Temper, &s;o much Earne&s;tne&s;s and Motion of his Spirits, which were apparent in his Countenance, that it was evident it was the true Sen&s;e of his Soul: There was no room to doubt his Since|rity.</P>
<P>I told him, I once thought my &s;elf a kind of a Monarch in my old Station, of which I had given him an Account, but that I thought he was not a Monarch only, but a great Conqueror; for that he that has got a Victory over his own exorbitant De&s;ires, and has the ab&s;olute Dominion over him|&s;elf, who&s;e Rea&s;on entirely governs his Will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a City. But, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> &s;hall I take the Liberty to ask you a Que&s;tion? With all my Heart, &s;ays he. If he Door of your Liberty was open'd, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
<PB N="354" REF="363">
would you not take hold of it to deliver your &s;elf from this Exile.</P>
<P>Hold, &s;aid he, your Que&s;tion is &s;ubtle, and re|quires &s;ome &s;erious ju&s;t Di&s;tinctions, to give it a &s;incere An&s;wer; and I'll give it you from the Bot|tom of my Heart. Nothing that I know of in this World would move me to deliver my &s;elf from this State of Bani&s;hment, except the&s;e two, Fir&s;t, the Enjoyment of my Relations, and Secondly, a lit|tle warmer Climate; but I prote&s;t to you, that to go back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Power, the Hurry of a Mini&s;ter of State, the Wealth, the Gaiety, and the Plea&s;ures, that is to &s;ay, Follies of a Courtier; if my Ma&s;ter &s;hould &s;end me Word this Moment, that he re&s;tores me to all he bani&s;h'd me from; I prote&s;t, <HI>If I know my &s;elf at all,</HI> I would not leave this Wilderne&s;s, the&s;e De&s;arts, and the&s;e frozen Lakes, for the Palace at <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI></P>
<P>But, my Lord, &s;aid I, perhaps you not only are bani&s;h'd from the Plea&s;ures of the Court, and from the Power, and Authority, and Wealth you enjoy'd before, but you may be ab&s;ent too from &s;ome of the Conveniences of Life, your E&s;tate perhaps confi&s;cated and your Effects plunder'd, and the Supplies left you here may not be &s;uitable to the ordinary Demands of Life.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;ays he, that is as you &s;uppo&s;e me to be a Lord, or a Prince, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So indeed I am; but you are now to con&s;ider me only as a Man, a human Creature, not at all di&s;tingui&s;h'd from another, and &s;o I can &s;uffer no Want, unle&s;s I &s;hould be vi&s;ited with Sickne&s;s and Di&s;tempers. However, to put the Que&s;tion out of Di&s;pute; you &s;ee our
<PB N="355" REF="364">
Manner; we are in this Place five Per&s;ons of Rank we live perfectly retir'd, as &s;uited to a State of Ba|ni&s;hment; we have &s;omething re&s;cu'd from the Shipwreck of our Fortunes, which keeps us from the meer Nece&s;&s;ity of hunting for our Food; but the poor Soldiers who are here, without that Help, live in as much Plenty as we, who go into the Woods and catch Sables and Foxes; the Labour of a Month will maintain them a Year; and as the Way of living is not expen&s;ive, &s;o it is not hard to get &s;ufficient to our &s;elves. So that Objection is out of Doors.</P>
<P>I have not room to give a full Account of the mo&s;t agreeable Conver&s;ation I had with this truly great Man; in all which he &s;hew'd, that his Mind was &s;o in&s;pir'd with a &s;uperior Knowledge of Things, &s;o &s;upported by Religion, as well as by a va&s;t Share of Wi&s;dom; that his Contempt of the World was really as much as he had ex|pre&s;s'd, and that he was always the &s;ame to the la&s;t, as will appear in the Story I am going to tell.</P>
<P>I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful Winter I thought it to be, the Cold &s;o inten&s;e, that I could not &s;o much as look abroad without being wrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before my Face, or rather a Hood with only a Hole for Breath, and two for Sight: The little Day-light we had, was, as we reckon'd, for three Months, not above five Hours a day, and &s;ix at mo&s;t; only that the Snow lying on the Ground continually, and the Weather clear, it was never quite dark: Our Hor&s;es were kept (or rather &s;tarv'd) under Ground, and as for our Servants, for we hir'd three Servants here to look after our Hor&s;es and &s;elves, we had
<PB N="356" REF="365">
every now and then their Fingers and Toes to thaw and take care of, le&s;t they &s;hould mortify and fall off.</P>
<P>It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Hou&s;es being clo&s;e, the Walls thick, the Lights &s;mall, and the Gla&s;s all double; our Food was chiefly the Fle&s;h of Deer dry'd and cur'd in the Sea&s;on; good Bread enough, but bak'd as Biskets; dry'd Fi&s;h of &s;everal Sorts, and &s;ome Fle&s;h of Mutton, and of the Buffeloes, which is pretty good Beef: All the Stores of Provi&s;ion for the Winter are laid up in the Summer, and well cur'd; our Drink was Water mix'd with Aqua-vitae in|&s;tead of Brandy, and for a Treat, Mead in&s;tead of Wine, which, however, they have excellent good: The Hunters, who venture abroad all Wea|thers, frequently brought us in fre&s;h Veni&s;on, ve|ry fat and good, and &s;ometimes Bears Fle&s;h, but we did not much care for the la&s;t: We had a good Stock of Tea, with which we treated our Friends, as above; and in a word, we liv'd very chearfully and well, all things con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>It was now <HI>March,</HI> and the Days grown con&s;i|derably longer, and the Weather, at lea&s;t, tolera|ble, &s;o the other Travellers began to prepare Sleds to carry them over the Snow, and to get things ready to be going; but my Mea&s;ures being fix'd, as I have &s;aid, for <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> and not for <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> or the <HI>Baltick,</HI> I made no Motion; knowing very well that the Ships from the South do not &s;et out for that Part of the World till <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> and that if I was there by the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> it would be as &s;oon as any Ships would be ready to go away; and therefore, I &s;ay, I made no ha&s;te to be gone, as others did; in a word, I &s;aw a great many Peo|ple,
<PB N="357" REF="366">
nay, all the Travellers go away before me: It &s;eems every Year they go from thence to <HI>Mu&s;|cow</HI> for Trade, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to carry Furs, and buy Ne|ce&s;&s;aries with them, which they bring back to fur|ni&s;h their Shops; al&s;o others went of the &s;ame Errand to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> but then they al&s;o be|ing to come back again above 800 Miles, went all out before me.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, about the latter End of <HI>May</HI> I began to make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this, it occurr'd to me, that &s;eeing all the&s;e People were bani&s;h'd by the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> to <HI>Siberia,</HI> and yet when they came there, were left at Liberty to go whither they would; why did they not then go away to any Part of the World where|ever they thought fit, and I began to examine what &s;hould hinder them from making &s;uch an At|tempt.</P>
<P>But my Wonder was over, when I enter'd upon that Subject with the Per&s;on I have mention'd, who an&s;wer'd me thus: Con&s;ider, Fir&s;t, Sir, &s;aid he, the Place where we are; and Secondly, the Condition we are in; e&s;pecially, &s;aid he, the Ge|nerality of the People who are bani&s;h'd hither; we are &s;urrounded, &s;aid he, with &s;tronger Things than Bars and Bolts; on the North Side an unna|vigable Ocean, where Ship never &s;ail'd, and Boat never &s;wam; neither, if we had both, could we know where to go with them: Every other Way, &s;aid he, we have above a Thou&s;and Miles to pa&s;s through the Czar's own Dominions, and By-Ways utterly unpa&s;&s;able, except by the Roads made by the Governour, and by the Towns garri&s;on'd by his Troops; &s;o that we could neither pa&s;s undi&s;|cover'd
<PB N="358" REF="367">
by the Road, or &s;ub&s;i&s;t any other Way, &s;o that it is in vain to attempt it.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilenc'd indeed at once, and found that they were in a Pri&s;on, every Jot as &s;ecure as if they had been lock'd up in the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Mu&s;cow;</HI> however, it came into my Thought, that I might certainly be made an In&s;trument to procure the E&s;cape of this excellent Per&s;on, and that what|ever Hazard I run, I would certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took an Occa&s;ion one Evening to tell him my Thoughts: I repre&s;ented to him, that it was very ea&s;y for me to carry him away, there being no Guard over him in the Coun|try, and as I was not going to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> but to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> and that I went in the nature of a Caravan, by which I was not oblig'd to lye in the &s;tationa|ry Towns in the De&s;art, but could encamp every Night where I would, we might ea&s;ily pa&s;s unin|terrupted to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> where I would immedi|ately &s;ecure him on board an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, and carry him off &s;afe along with me; and as to his Sub&s;i&s;tence, and other Particulars, it &s;hould be my Care till he could better &s;upply him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He heard me very attentively, and look'd ear|ne&s;tly on me all the while I &s;poke, nay, I could &s;ee in his very Face, that what I &s;aid put his Spirits into an exceeding Ferment; his Colour frequently chang'd, his Eyes look'd red, and his Heart flut|ter'd, that it might be even perceiv'd in his Coun|tenance; nor could he immediately an&s;wer me. When I had done, and as it were expected what he would &s;ay to it; but after he had paus'd a little he embrac'd me, and &s;aid, how unhappy are we unguarded Creatures as we are, that even our greate&s;t Acts of Friend&s;hip are made Snares to us,
<PB N="359" REF="368">
and we are made Tempters of one another! My dear Friend, &s;aid he, your Offer is &s;o &s;incere, has &s;uch Kindne&s;s in it, is &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted in it &s;elf, and is &s;o calculated for my Advantage, that I mu&s;t have very little Knowledge of the World, if I did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the Obligation I have upon me to you for it. But did you believe I was &s;incere in what I have &s;o often &s;aid to you of my Contempt of the World? Did you believe I &s;poke my very Soul to you, and that I had really obtain'd that Degree of Felicity here, that had plac'd me above all that the World could give me, or do for me? Did you believe I was &s;incere, when I told you I would not go back, if I was re-call'd even to be all, that once I was in the Court with the Favour of the Czar my Ma&s;ter? Did you believe me, my Friend, to be an hone&s;t Man, or did you think me to be a boa&s;ting Hypo|crite? Here he &s;topp'd, as if he would hear what I would &s;ay, but indeed, I &s;oon after perceiv'd, that he &s;topp'd becau&s;e his Spirits were in Motion, his great Heart was full of Struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confe&s;s, a&s;toni&s;h'd at the thing as well as at the Man, and I us'd &s;ome Ar|guments with him to urge him to &s;et him&s;elf free: That he ought to look upon this as a Door open'd by Heaven for his Deliverance, and a Summons by Providence, who has the Care and Di&s;po&s;ition of all Events, to do him&s;elf good, and to render him&s;elf u&s;eful in the World.</P>
<P>He had by this time recover'd him&s;elf: How do you know Sir, &s;ays he warmly, that in&s;tead of a Summons from Heaven, it may not be a Feint of another In&s;trument? Repre&s;enting in all the allu|ring Colours to me the Shew of Felicity as a Deli|verance, which may in it&s;elf be my Snare, and
<PB N="360" REF="369">
tends directly to my Ruin: Here I am free from the Temptation of returning to my former mi&s;era|ble Greatne&s;s; there I am not &s;ure but that all the Seeds of Pride, Ambition, Avarice and Luxury, which I know remain in Nature, may revive and take Root, and in a Word, again overwhelm me, and then the happy Pri&s;oner, who you &s;ee now Ma&s;ter of his Soul's Liberty, &s;hall be the mi&s;erable Slave of his own Sen&s;es, in the Full of all per&s;onal Liberty: Dear Sir, let me remain in this ble&s;&s;ed Confinement, bani&s;h'd from the Crimes of Life, rather than purcha&s;e a Shew of Freedom, at the Expence of the Liberty of my Rea&s;on, and at the Expence of the future Happine&s;s which now I have in my View, but &s;hall then, I fear, quickly lo&s;e Sight of; for I am but Fle&s;h, a Man, a meer Man, have Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections as likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s and overthrow me as any Man: O be not my Friend and my Tempter both together!</P>
<P>If I was &s;urpriz'd before, I was quite dumb now, and &s;tood &s;ilent, looking at him, and indeed ad|mir'd at what I &s;aw; the Struggle in his Soul was &s;o great, that tho' the Weather was extreamly cold, it put him into a mo&s;t violent Sweat, and I found he wanted to give Vent to his Mind; &s;o I &s;aid a Word or two, that I would leave him to con&s;ider of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my own Apartment.</P>
<P>About two Hours after I heard &s;ome Body at, or near, the Door of my Room, and I was going to open the Door, but he had open'd it, and came in: My dear Friend, &s;ays he, you had almo&s;t over|&s;et me, but I am recover'd; do not take it ill that I do not clo&s;e with your Offer, I a&s;&s;ure you, 'tis not for want of a Sen&s;e of the Kindne&s;s
<PB N="361" REF="370">
of it in you, and I came to make the mo&s;t &s;in|cere Acknowledgment of it to you; but I hope I have got the Victory over my &s;elf.</P>
<P>My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I hope you are fully &s;atisfy'd that you do not re&s;i&s;t the Call of Heaven. Sir, &s;aid he, if it had been from Heaven, the &s;ame Power would have influenc'd me to accept it; but I hope, and am fully &s;atisfy'd, that it is from Heaven that I decline it, and I have an infi|nite Satisfaction in the Parting, that you &s;hall leave me an hone&s;t Man &s;till, tho' not a free Man.</P>
<P>I had nothing to do but to acquie&s;ce, and make Profe&s;&s;ions to him of my having no End in it, but a &s;incere De&s;ire to &s;erve him: He em|brac'd me very pa&s;&s;ionately, and a&s;&s;ur'd me, he was &s;en&s;ible of that, and &s;hould always acknow|ledge it, and with that he offer'd me a very fine Pre&s;ent of Sables, too much indeed for me to accept from a Man in his Circum&s;tances, and I would have avoided them, but he would not be refus'd.</P>
<P>The next Morning I &s;ent my Servant to his Lord&s;hip, with a &s;mall Pre&s;ent of Tea, and two Pieces of <HI>China</HI> Damask, and four little Wedges of <HI>Japan</HI> Gold, which did not all weigh above &s;ix Ounces, or thereabour, but were far &s;hort of the Value of his Sables, which, indeed, when I came to <HI>England,</HI> I found worth near 200 <HI>l.</HI> He accepted the Tea, and one Piece of the Damask, and one of the Pieces of Gold, which had a fine Stamp upon it, of the <HI>Japan</HI> Coinage, which I found he took for the Rarity of it, but would not take any more, and he &s;ent word by my Ser|vant that he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with me.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="371">
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had pa&s;s'd between us, and hop'd I would not move him any more in that Affair; out that &s;ince I had made &s;uch a generous Offer to him, he ask'd me, if I had Kindne&s;s enough to offer the &s;ame to another Per&s;on that he would name to me, in whom he had a great Share of Concern; I told him, that I could not &s;ay I en|clin'd to do &s;o much for any one but him&s;elf, for whom I had a particular Value, and &s;hould have been glad to have been the In&s;trument of his Deliverance; however, if he would plea&s;e to name the Per&s;on to me, I would give him my An&s;wer, and hop'd he would not be di&s;plea|&s;ed with me, if he was with my An&s;wer; he told me, it was only his Son, who, tho' I had not &s;een, yet was in the &s;ame Condition with him&s;elf, and above two hundred Miles from him, on the other Side the <HI>Oby;</HI> but that if I con|&s;ented, he would &s;end for him.</P>
<P>I made no He&s;itation, but told him I would do it: I made &s;ome Ceremony in letting him under&s;tand that it was wholly on his Account, and that &s;eeing I could not prevail on him, I would &s;hew my Re&s;pect to him, by my Concern for his Son; but the&s;e Things are too tedious to repeat here: He &s;ent away the next Day for his Son, and in about twenty Days he came back with the Me&s;&s;enger, bringing &s;ix or &s;even Hor&s;es, loaded with very rich Furs, and which in the whole, amounted to a very great Value.</P>
<P>His Servants brought the Hor&s;es into the Town, but left the young Lord at a Di&s;tance, till Night, when he came <HI>incognito</HI> into our
<PB N="363" REF="372">
Apartment, and his Father pre&s;ented him to me; and in &s;hort, we concerted there the man|ner of our travelling, and every Thing proper for the Journey.</P>
<P>I had bought a con&s;iderable Quantity of Sables, black Fox Skins, fine Ermines, and &s;uch other Furs as are very rich; I &s;ay, I had bought them in that City in Exchange for &s;ome of the Goods I brought from <HI>China;</HI> in particular for the Cloves and Nutmegs, of which, I &s;old the greate&s;t Part here, and the re&s;t afterwards at <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> for a much better Price than I could have done at <HI>London;</HI> and my Partner who was &s;en&s;ible of the Profit, and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s more particular|ly than mine was Merchandize, was mightily pleas'd with our Stay, on Account of the Traf|fick we made here.</P>
<P>It was the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> when I left this remote Place, a City, I believe, little heard of in the World; and indeed it is &s;o far out of the Road of Commerce, that I know not how it &s;hould be much talk'd of. We were now come to a very &s;mall Caravan, being only thirty two Hor&s;es and Camels in all, and all of them pa&s;s'd for mine, tho' my new Gue&s;t was Propri|etor of eleven of them; it was mo&s;t natural al&s;o that I &s;hould take more Servants with me than I had before, and the young Lord pa&s;s'd for my Steward; what great Man I pa&s;s'd for my &s;elf, I know not, neither did it concern me to en|quire; we had here, the wor&s;t and the large&s;t De&s;art to pa&s;s over that we met with in all the Journey; indeed I call it the wor&s;t, becau&s;e the Way was very deep in &s;ome Places, and very uneven in others; the be&s;t we had to &s;ay for
<PB N="364" REF="373">
it, was, that we thought we had no Troops of <HI>Tar|tars</HI> and Robbers to fear, and that they never came on this Side the River <HI>Oby,</HI> or at lea&s;t, but very &s;eldom, but we &s;ound it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>My young Lord had with him, a faithful <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Servant, or rather a <HI>Siberian</HI> Servant, who was perfectly acquainted with the Country, and led us by private Roads, that we avoided coming in to the principal Towns and Cities, upon the great Road, &s;uch as <HI>Tumen, Soly-Kam|skoi,</HI> and &s;everal others; becau&s;e the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Garri&s;ons which are kept there, are very cu|rious and &s;trict in their Ob&s;ervation upon Travellers; and &s;earching lea&s;t any of the ba|ni&s;h'd Per&s;ons of Note &s;hould make their E&s;cape that Way into <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> but by this Means, as we were kept out of the Cities, &s;o our whole Journey was a De&s;art, and we were oblig'd to encamp and lye in our Tents, when we might have had very good Accommodation in the Cities on the Way: This the young Lord was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that he would not allow us to lye abroad, when we came to &s;everal Cities, on the Way, but lay abroad him&s;elf with his Servant in the Woods, and met us always at the appointed Places.</P>
<P>We were ju&s;t enter'd <HI>Europe,</HI> having pa&s;s'd the River <HI>Kama,</HI> which in the&s;e Parts, is the Boundary between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the fir&s;t City on the <HI>European</HI> Side was call'd <HI>Soloy-Kamaskoy,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, the great City, on the River <HI>Kama;</HI> and here we thought to have &s;een &s;ome evident Alteration in the People, their Manner, their Habit, their Re|ligion, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s; but we were mi|&s;taken,
<PB N="365" REF="374">
for as we had a va&s;t De&s;art to pa&s;s, which by Relation, is near &s;even hundred Miles long in &s;ome Places, but not above two hun|dred Miles over where we pa&s;s'd it; &s;o till we came pa&s;t that horrible Place, we found very little Difference between that Country and the <HI>Mogul Tartary;</HI> the People, mo&s;tly Pagans, and little better than the Savages of <HI>America,</HI> their Hou|&s;es and Towns full of Idols, and their Way of Living, wholly barbarous, except in the Cities as above, and the Villages near them; where they are Chri&s;tians as they call them&s;elves, of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, but have their Religion mingled with &s;o many Reliques of Super&s;tition, that it is &s;carce to be known in &s;ome Places from meer Sorcery and Witchcraft.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing this Forre&s;t, I thought indeed we mu&s;t, after all our Dangers were in our Imagination e|&s;cap'd, as before, have been plunder'd and robb'd, and perhaps murther'd by a Troop of Thieves; of what Country they were, whether the ro|ving Bands of the <HI>O&s;tiachi,</HI> a Kind of <HI>Tartars</HI> or wild People on the Bank of the <HI>Obi,</HI> had rang'd thus far, or whether they were the Sable-Hunters of <HI>Siberia,</HI> I am yet at a Lo&s;s to know; but they were all on Hor&s;eback, carry'd Bows and Arrows, and were at fir&s;t about five and forty in Number; they came &s;o near to us, as within about two Mu&s;quet Shot, and asking no Que&s;tions, they &s;urrounded us with their Hor&s;e, and look'd very earne&s;tly upon us twice; at length they plac'd them&s;elves ju&s;t in our Way, upon which, we drew up in a little Line before our Camels, being not above &s;ixteen Men in all; and being drawn up thus, we halted and &s;ent out the <HI>Siberian</HI> Servant, who attended his
<PB N="366" REF="375">
Lord, to &s;ee who they were; his Ma&s;ter was the more willing to let him go, becau&s;e he was not a little apprehen&s;ive, that they were a <HI>Sy|berian</HI> Troop &s;ent out after him: The Man came up near them with a Flag of Truce, and call'd them, but tho' he &s;poke &s;everal of their Languages or Dialects of Languages ra|ther, he could not under&s;tand a Word they &s;aid; however, after &s;ome Signs to him, not to come nearer to them at his Peril; &s;o he &s;aid, he under&s;tood them to mean offering to &s;hoot at him if he advanc'd; the Fellow came back no wi&s;er than he went, only that by their Dre&s;s, he &s;aid, he believ'd them to be &s;ome <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kalmuck,</HI> or of the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Hoords; and that there mu&s;t be more of them upon the great De&s;art, tho' he never heard that any of them ever were &s;een &s;o far North before.</P>
<P>This was &s;mall Comfort to us; however, we had no Remedy; there was on our left Hand at about a Quarter of a Mile's Di&s;tance, a little Grove or Clump of Trees which &s;tood clo&s;e together, and very near the Road; I immediately re&s;olv'd we would advance to tho&s;e Trees, and fortify our &s;elves as well as we could there; for fir&s;t I con|&s;idered, that the Trees would in a great Mea|&s;ure cover us from their Arrows, and in the next Place, they could not come to charge us in a Bo|dy; it was indeed my old <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilot who propo&s;ed it, and who had this Excellency at|tending him, namely, that he was always readie&s;t and mo&s;t apt to direct and encourage us in Ca|&s;es of the mo&s;t Danger; we advanc'd immedi|ately with what Speed we could, and gain'd that little Wood, the <HI>Tartars</HI> or Thieves, for we know not what to call them, keeping their Stand,
<PB N="367" REF="376">
and not attempting to hinder us; when we came thither, we found to our great Satisfaction, that it was a &s;wampy &s;pringy Piece of Ground, and on the one Side, a very great Spring of Water, which running out in a little Rill or Brook, was a little farther, joyn'd by another of the like Bigne&s;s, and was in &s;hort, the Head or Source of a con&s;iderable River, call'd afterwards the <HI>Wirt|ska;</HI> the Trees which grew about this Spring, were not all above two hundred, but were very large, and &s;tood pretty thick; &s;o that as &s;oon as we got in, we &s;aw our &s;elves perfectly &s;afe from the Enemy, unle&s;s they alighted and attack'd us on Foot.</P>
<P>But to make this more difficult, our <HI>Portu|gueze,</HI> with indefatigable Application, cut down great Arms of the Trees, and laid them hang|ing <HI>not quite cut off</HI> from one Tree to another, &s;o that he made a continued Fence almo&s;t round us.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd here waiting the Motion of the Ene|my &s;ome Hours, without perceiving they made any Motion; when about two Hours before Night, they came down directly upon us, and tho' we had not perceiv'd it, we found they had been join'd by &s;ome more of the &s;ame, &s;o that they were near four&s;core Hor&s;e, where of how|ever, we fancy'd &s;ome were Women: They came on till they were within half Shot of our little Wood, when we fir'd one Mu&s;quet without Ball, and call'd to them in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Tongue, to know what they wanted, and bid them keep off; but as if they knew nothing of what we &s;aid, they came on with a double Fury direct|ly up to the Wood &s;ide, not imagining we were
<PB N="368" REF="377">
&s;o barricado'd that they could not break in; our old Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our Engineer, and de&s;ir'd of us not to fire upon them till they came within Pi&s;tol-Shot, and that we might be &s;ure to kill, and that when we did fire, we &s;hould be &s;ure to take good Aim; we bad him give the Word of Command, which he delay'd &s;o long, that they were &s;ome of them within two Pikes length of us when we fir'd.</P>
<P>We aim'd &s;o true, (or Providence directed our Shot &s;o &s;ure) that we kill'd fourteen of them, and wounded &s;everal others, as al&s;o &s;everal of their Hor&s;es; for we had all of us loaded our Pieces with two or three Bullets at lea&s;t..</P>
<P>They were terribly &s;urpriz'd with our Fire, and retreated immediately about one Hundred Rods from us; in which Time, we loaded our Pieces again, and &s;eeing them keep that Di&s;tance, we &s;ally'd out and catch'd four or five of their Hor&s;es, who&s;e Riders we &s;uppo&s;e were kill'd, and coming up to the dead, we could ea&s;ily perceive they were <HI>Tartars,</HI> but knew not from what Country, or how they came to make an Excur&s;ion &s;uch an unu&s;ual Length.</P>
<P>About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack us again, and rode round our little Wood, to &s;ee where el&s;e they might break in; but finding us always ready to Face them, they went off again, and we re&s;olv'd not to &s;tir from the Place for that Night.</P>
<P>We &s;lept little you may be &s;ure, but &s;pent the mo&s;t Part of the Night in &s;trengthning our

Situation, and barricadoing the Entrances into the Wood, and keeping a &s;trict Watch, we waited for Day-Light, and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome Di&s;covery indeed; for the Enemy, who we thought were di&s;|courag'd with the Reception they had met with, were now encreas'd to no le&s;s than three hundred, and had &s;et up eleven or twelve Huts and Tents, as if they were re&s;olv'd to be|&s;iege us; and this little Camp they had pitch'd upon the open Plain, at about three Quarters of a Mile from us. We were indeed &s;urpriz'd at this Di&s;covery; and now I confe&s;s, I gave my &s;elf over for lo&s;t, and all that I had: The Lo&s;s of my Effects did not lye &s;o near me, <HI>(tho' they were very con&s;iderable)</HI> as the Thoughts of falling into the Hands of &s;uch <HI>Barbarians,</HI> at the lat|ter End of my Journey, after &s;o many Difficul|ties and Hazards as I had gone thro'; and even in Sight of our Port, where we expected Safety and Deliverance; as for my Partner, he was ra|ging; he declar'd, that to lo&s;e his Goods would be his Ruin; and he would rather die than be &s;tarv'd; and he was for fighting to the la&s;t Drop.</P>
<P>The young Lord, as gallant as ever Fle&s;h &s;hew'd it &s;elf, was for fighting to the la&s;t al&s;o; and my old Pilot was of the Opinion we were able to re&s;i&s;t them all, in the Situation we were then in; and thus we &s;pent the Day in Debates of what we &s;hould do; but towards Evening, we found that the Number of our Enemies &s;till encreas'd, perhaps as they were abroad in &s;everal Parties for Prey; the fir&s;t had &s;ent out Scouts to call for Help, and to acquaint them of the Booty, and we did not know, but by the Morning they

might &s;till be a greater Number; &s;o I began to enquire of tho&s;e People we had brought from <HI>Tobolski,</HI> if there was no other, or more private Ways by which we might avoid them in the Night, and perhaps either retreat to &s;ome Town, or get Help to guard us over the De&s;art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Syberian,</HI> who was Servant to the young Lord, told us, if we de&s;ign'd to avoid them and not fight, he would engage to carry us off in the Night, to a Way that went North towards the <HI>Pe|trou,</HI> by which he made no Que&s;tion, but we might get away, and the <HI>Tartars</HI> never the wi|&s;er; but he &s;aid, his Lord had told him, he would not retreat, but would rather chu&s;e to fight. I told him, he mi&s;took his Lord, for that he was too wi&s;e a Man to love Fighting for the &s;ake of it; that I knew his Lord was brave enough by what he had &s;hew'd already; but that his Lord knew better, than to de&s;ire to have &s;eventeen or eighteen Men fight five hundred, unle&s;s an unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity forc'd them to it; and that if he thought it po&s;&s;ible for us to e&s;cape in the Night, we had nothing el&s;e to do but to attempt it. He an&s;wer'd, if his Lord gave him &s;uch Orders, he would lo&s;e his Life if he did not perform it; we &s;oon brought his Lord to give that Order, tho' privately, and we immediately prepar'd for the putting it in Practice.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, as &s;oon as it began to be dark, we kindled a Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burning, and prepar'd &s;o as to make it burn all Night, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> might conclude we were &s;till there; but as &s;oon as it was dark, (that is to &s;ay) &s;o as we could &s;ee the Stars) for

<P>After we had travell'd two Hours very hard, it began to be lighter &s;till, not that it was quite dark all Night, but the Moon began to ri&s;e, &s;o that in &s;hort, it was rather lighter than we wi&s;h'd it to be; but by &s;ix a Clock the next Morning we were gotten near forty Miles, tho' the Truth is, we almo&s;t &s;poil'd our Hor&s;es. Here we found a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Village named <HI>Kerma|zinskoy,</HI> where we re&s;ted, and heard nothing of the <HI>Calmuck Tartars</HI> that Day; about two Hours before Night we &s;et out again, and travell'd till eight the next Morning, tho' not quite &s;o quite as before, and about &s;even a Clock we pa&s;s'd a little River call'd <HI>Kirtza,</HI> and came to a good large Town inhabited by <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> and very po|pulous, call'd <HI>Ozomoys;</HI> there we heard that &s;e|veral Troops or Hoords of <HI>Calmucks</HI> had been abroad upon the De&s;art, but that we were now compleatly out of Danger of them, which was to our great Satisfaction you may be &s;ure. Here we were oblig'd to get &s;ome fre&s;h Hor&s;es, and having need enough of Re&s;t, we &s;tay'd five Days; and my Partner and I agreed to give the hone&s;t <HI>Syberian,</HI> who brought us thither, the Value of ten Pi&s;toles, for his conducting us.</P>
<P>In five Days more we came to <HI>Veu&s;lima,</HI> upon the River <HI>Witzogda,</HI> and running into the <HI>Dwina,</HI> we were there very happily near the end of our Travels by Land, that River being navigable in &s;even Days Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Arch-Angel:</HI> From hence we came to

<HI>Lawrenskoy</HI> the 3d of <HI>July,</HI> and providing our &s;elves with two Luggage Boats, and a Barge for our own Convenience, we embark'd the 7th, and ar|riv'd all &s;afe at <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> the 18th, having been a Year and five Months and three Days on the Journey, including our Stay of eight Months and odd Days at <HI>Tobolski.</HI></P>
<P>We were oblig'd to &s;tay at this Place &s;ix Weeks for the Arrival of the Ships, and mu&s;t have tarry'd longer, had not a <HI>Hamburgher</HI> come in above a Month &s;ooner than any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships; when after &s;ome Con&s;ideration, that the City of <HI>Ham|burgh</HI> might happen to be as good a Market for our Goods as <HI>London,</HI> we all took Freight with him, and having put my Goods on board, it was mo&s;t natural for me to put my Steward on board to take care of them, by which means my young Lord had a &s;ufficient Opportunity to conceal him|&s;elf, never coming on Shore in all the time we &s;tay'd there; and this he did, that he might not be &s;een in the City, where &s;ome of the <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> Merchants would certainly have &s;een and di&s;co|ver'd him.</P>
<P>We &s;ail'd from <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> the 20th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the &s;ame Year, and after no extraordinary bad Voyage, arriv'd in the <HI>Elbe</HI> the 13th of <HI>September.</HI> Here my Partner and I found a very good Sale for our Goods, as well tho&s;e of <HI>China,</HI> as the Sables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of <HI>Syberia;</HI> and dividing the Produce of our Effects, my Share amounted to 3475&mdash;17&mdash;3<HI>d.</HI> notwith&s;tanding &s;o many Lo&s;&s;es we had &s;u&s;tain'd, and Charges we had been at; only remembring that I had included in this, about &s;ix hundred Pounds worth of Diamonds which I had purchas'd at <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="382">
Here the young Lord took his leave of us, and went up the <HI>Elbe</HI> in order to go to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he re&s;olv'd to &s;eek Protection, and where he could corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of his Fa|ther's Friends who were left alive: He did not part without all the Te&s;timonies he could give me of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, and his Sen&s;e of my Kindne&s;s to the Prince his Father.</P>
<P>To conclude, having &s;tay'd near four Months in <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> I came from thence over Land to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where I embark'd in the Pacquet, and arriv'd in <HI>London</HI> the 10th of <HI>January,</HI> 1705, ha|ving been gone from <HI>England</HI> ten Years and nine Months.</P>
<P>And here, re&s;olving to harra&s;s my &s;elf no more, I am preparing for a longer Journey than all the&s;e, having liv'd 72 Years a Life of infinite Variety, and learn'd &s;ufficiently to know the Value of Re|tirement, and the Ble&s;&s;ing of ending our Days in Peace.</P>
