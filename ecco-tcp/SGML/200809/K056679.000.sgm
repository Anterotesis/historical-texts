<HEAD>A Brief Survey OF THE <HI REND="blackletterType">Legal Liberties</HI> OF THE <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is no Time now to make Flou|ri&s;hes, and lay down Aphori&s;ms to debate upon: Matters of Fact mu&s;t &s;peak them&s;elves; and that they may do &s;o, let us bringthem together.</P>
<P>The <HI>Toleration</HI> was granted to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> at the Beginning of the Revolution; he that told us, <HI>It was not a Courte&s;y, but a Capitula|tion, the Performance of an Agreement,</HI> not <HI>an Act of meer Tenderne&s;s and Charity,</HI> &s;aid True, or he &s;aid Fal&s;e; for my Part, I never heard him Confuted, or much &s;aid to contradict it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
If the <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> was a Grant of meer Charity and Mercy, yet it was no other Charity and Mercy than the <HI>Church of Eng|land,</HI> as Chri&s;tians, were obliged to &s;hew: Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience being contrary to the Principles of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion;</HI> and if they were oblig'd to grant it, they are equally oblig'd to continue it, unle&s;s they can alledge, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have done any Thing to forfeit it, which we challenge all the <HI>Tories</HI> in <HI>Eng|land</HI> to prove.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> was a Capitu|lation, all Capitulations ought to be perform'd; all Agreements ought to be executed; and it is as much their Right to demand the Pre&s;er|ving of it, as it was to demand the Enacting it.</P>
<P>But the Queen, be&s;ides all this, has pro|mis'd to continue it, and to pre&s;erve it <HI>Inviol|ably;</HI> we doubt not Her Maje&s;ty meant to do &s;o when She &s;aid it, and means &s;o &s;till: But what mean they who would oblige Her, or per&s;wade Her to break Her Word?</P>
<P>We do not &s;ay the Parliament offer this; and we doubt not but &s;ome People flatter them|&s;elves, that all the&s;e Things are not only Con|&s;i&s;tent with, but will be Effectual for the <HI>Invi|olable</HI> Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Toleration;</HI> we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently how it will be prov'd.</P>
<P>The Managers of Per&s;ecuting Principles have very pretty Ways with them to cover and guild over the mo&s;t effectual Mea&s;ures of De|&s;troying us, with fair Pretences of Pre&s;erving us. Perhaps this Taking away the Schools and Academies of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> is done the better to pre&s;erve, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Inviolably.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
We find in the fir&s;t Section of the la&s;t <HI>Occa|&s;ional Bill,</HI> the Enacting Clau&s;es thus Introdu|ced, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now for the better Securing the &s;aid Church, <HI>&s;o far is Good,</HI> and Quieting the Minds of Her Maje&s;ty's <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and <HI>Di&s;|&s;enting</HI> Subjects, and Rendering them Secure in the Exerci&s;e of their Religious Wor&s;hip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Be it Enacted</HI></P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, That the Bill following tho&s;e Words, did abridge the &s;aid <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> of any of their Liberties, in the Exerci&s;e of their Re|ligious Wor&s;hip: But this I will &s;ay, That if the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were &s;o abridg'd by that Act, then joining the Words together, it will follow, <HI>That their &s;aid Liberties were &s;o abridg'd, the better to Quiet their Minds, and for the Securing them in the Exerci&s;e of their Religious Wor&s;hip;</HI> perhaps other Laws may be Ble&s;s'd with the like Congruity.</P>
<P>Before we go on to Examine what may, or not be deem'd an Attempt upon, and Incon&s;i|&s;tent with the <HI>Religious Liberties</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI> it may be very u&s;eful for us to enquire what tho&s;e <HI>Liberties</HI> really are; to which Pur|po&s;e, and that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> may know how far tho&s;e <HI>Liberties</HI> do or do not extend, and when they are or are not Invaded, I believe it very much to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to publi&s;h the &s;aid <HI>Toleration Act</HI> at large, which, altho' it be put at the End of this Tract, the Reader is de&s;ir'd to turn to it, and Peru&s;e it before he goes on any farther.</P>
<P>HAVING now Suppos'd, that the Readers of this Tract have Perus'd the Act of <HI>Toleration</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
deliberately, and have thereby a clear Account of what the <HI>Di&s;senters</HI> Liberties really are, it will be al&s;o Nece&s;&s;ary to let them &s;ee what it is that the pre&s;ent Depending Bill is to Enact again&s;t them, and &s;o we &s;hall pre&s;ently judge about the Word <HI>INVIOLABLY,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is true, and this is the great Pretence of tho&s;e who promote this Matter, That the keep|ing of Schools and Academies for the In&s;truc|ting and Educating our Children, is not ex|pre&s;ly a Part of the <HI>Toleration Bill;</HI> And there|fore &s;ay they, The <HI>Toleration</HI> may be Inviol|ably <HI>pre&s;erv'd, notwith&s;tanding the Pa&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent Bill</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> will refute this by alledg|ing, That the Liberty of Teaching and In|&s;tructing our Children, is &s;uch an E&s;&s;ential, in the <HI>Meaning</HI> of a <HI>Toleration,</HI> that it needs no more to be expre&s;s'd therein, than a Liberty of going out of our own Hou&s;es, or ri&s;ing out of our Beds, and putting on our Clothes, in Order to a religious A&s;&s;embly, need to be ex|pre&s;s'd in that Part of the Act which allows Places to be appointed for that Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>If any e&s;&s;ential Part of the <HI>Toleration</HI> be ta|ken away, altho' not expre&s;s'd, how is the <HI>Toleration</HI> then pre&s;erv'd <HI>Inviolably?</HI></P>
<P>Farther, the educating of Children is a Part of the religious Duties of a Chri&s;tian, and a|mong the&s;e of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> more e|&s;pecially regarded as &s;uch: If the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are abridg'd of what is their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, they are per&s;ecuted in the mo&s;t extreme Sen&s;e of Per&s;ecution; For the Con&s;equence is, they mu&s;t offend again&s;t this Law, becau&s;e they are
<PB N="7" REF="6">
bound <HI>to obey GOD rather than Man.</HI> In of|fending this Law they mu&s;t incur a Penalty; not being able to pay the Penalty, they mu&s;t go to Pri&s;on, and in Pri&s;on they mu&s;t peri&s;h: So that in Con&s;equence of this Law, the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> will &s;uffer <HI>Death</HI> for their Religion, and and yet the <HI>Toleration</HI> be pre&s;erved INVIO|LABLE.</P>
<P>I think the Plainne&s;s of this Ca&s;e is not to be found Fault with, Religion is nothing more or le&s;s than a Serving or Wor&s;hipping GOD, our Maker and Lawgiver. The Method is pre&s;crib'd by His <HI>Word; Con&s;cience</HI> is to every Man the Judge of his own Duty, and the Man|ner of Performing is this, Con&s;cience is a So|vereign Dictator in the Mind of Men, and it mu&s;t be obey'd; So it is not meet to make Laws to re&s;train it, human Power having no judicial Right over it.</P>
<P>As then Con&s;cience mu&s;t be obey'd, in which the Scripture is clear, <HI>Whether it be lawful to obey GOD rather than Man, judge ye?</HI> When Laws are made re&s;training us to &s;uch Things as Con&s;cience forbids to do, or commands not to omit, what mu&s;t we do?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer is plain, <HI>We mu&s;t &s;uffer.</HI> True, but then we mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>That this is</HI> PERSECU|TION: If then <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> is contrary to the <HI>Principles</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> as we have the Authority of Parliament, in the Preamble to the <HI>first occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> to prove; what fol|lows? But that every <HI>per&s;ecuting Act</HI> is an <HI>Un|chri&s;tian Act.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the pre&s;ent depending Bill be a Per&s;ecuting, and con&s;equently an unchri&s;tian &s;till, let others judge; this Deponent faith not.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
It may however be of &s;ome U&s;e to enquire into &s;ome of the Con&s;equences which the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> may expect from this Law, that tho&s;e who are to &s;uffer by it, may prepare their Minds for <HI>Martyrdom;</HI> and they who are to pa&s;s it, may con&s;ider what <HI>Ruin</HI> of <HI>Families,</HI> what <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Con&s;cientious Sufferers,</HI> what <HI>Encrea&s;e</HI> of <HI>Igno|rance,</HI> and con&s;equently of <HI>Error,</HI> they are go|ing to be the Cau&s;e of; and what terrible Havock they are going to make in the <HI>Reforma|tion,</HI> which has Enemies enough, and Wounds enough already. Perhaps when the&s;e Things come to be &s;eriou&s;ly reflected upon, they may con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> is thus reviv'd, what mu&s;t the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> do? <HI>Negatively,</HI> I'll tell you what they <HI>cannot do.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. They cannot &s;ay their <HI>Toleration</HI> is IN|VIOLABLY pre&s;erv'd: They that think this Bill does not interfere with the <HI>Toleration,</HI> may here compare them together; The one &s;ays, <HI>Ea&s;e is to be given to tender Con&s;ciences;</HI> The o|ther &s;ays, <HI>The tenderest Con&s;ciences &s;hall be op|pre&s;t;</HI> one &s;ays, <HI>The</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>&s;hall have Liber|ty to a&s;&s;emble, and their Children may wor&s;hip GOD with them:</HI> The other &s;ays, <HI>They &s;hall not have School-ma&s;ters to in&s;truct them how to Wor&s;hip;</HI> one gives them a Liberty of <HI>profe&s;&s;ing their Di&s;|&s;ent;</HI> The other denies them the Liberty of <HI>being Taught to know why they di&s;&s;ent:</HI> This is the ready Way indeed to make <HI>Di&s;&s;enting</HI> be a <HI>Faction</HI> in the next Age, as they pretend it is now <HI>not a religious Principle.</HI> Thus the <HI>Tole|ration</HI> is <HI>pre&s;erv'd,</HI> and not <HI>pre&s;erv'd</HI> at the &s;ame Time. The <HI>Letter</HI> of the <HI>Toleration</HI> is pre&s;erv'd
<PB N="9" REF="8">
in Deed, but the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential Parts</HI> are de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. They cannot &s;ay, they are kindly treated by the Church; and when they look back upon their own Conduct to the Church, they tell them plainly, <HI>they have not de&s;erv'd this U&s;age at their Hands;</HI> When they re&s;cued the Church from an evident Ruin in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time, mighty Promi&s;es of Temper and Tenderne&s;s were made them; let us &s;uppo&s;e now the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> parting with them at that Time in this Manner, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">"<HI>Yes, yes,</HI> Gentlemen, you promi&s;e us fair now, while you are under Apprehen|&s;ions of the <HI>Popi&s;h Party.</HI> Now you call us <HI>Brethren,</HI> and talk well of the <HI>&s;mall</HI> Differ|ences between us; and how Charity ought to bury what is pa&s;t, and to bind us clo&s;&s;er for the Time to come, that you find now you have been mi&s;taken, and that we are as <HI>faithful</HI> to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t</HI> as your &s;elves; and you will for ever e&s;teem us the <HI>&s;ame Chri&s;tians</HI> as your Selves, allowing us a <HI>Legal</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd Liberty, and living in <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> with us; will never more &s;uffer the <HI>indifferent Things</HI> which are in Di&s;pute among us to divide us. But when, by our A&s;&s;i&s;|tance, you are e&s;tabli&s;h'd again, you will for|get all the&s;e Things. When a Generation ri&s;es up, <HI>That knows not</HI> Jo&s;eph, they will call us all <HI>Schi&s;maticks,</HI> and <HI>Recu&s;ants</HI> again; Couple us with <HI>Papists,</HI> &s;ay we are <HI>Danger|ous</HI> to the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Enemies</HI> to <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and make new Laws again&s;t us, de&s;troy the <HI>Toleration</HI> you now offer us, and <HI>per&s;ecute</HI> us as bad as ever.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
When the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> &s;ays thus to them, Suppo&s;e a certain Grave Divine &s;tands up and Quotes the Words of <HI>Ha&s;ael</HI> the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria, Is thy Servant a Dog, that be &s;hould do this thing?</HI> What now would that Grave Divine &s;ay, <HI>for the Pa&s;&s;age is not a Fable,</HI> if he were to &s;ee this Bill pa&s;&s;ing the Hou&s;e? would he Plead, that <HI>this is not Per&s;ecution?</HI></P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is not only upon the word <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> tho' that is an&s;wer'd plain e|nough too: But is it <HI>Just?</HI> Is it <HI>Kind?</HI> Is it <HI>Grateful?</HI> Is it <HI>Agreeable</HI> to former Pretences? Is it what was <HI>Solemnly Promi&s;ed,</HI> when the <HI>Church</HI> &s;tood in need of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Sup|port of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> in the time of their Ex|tremity?

Is this the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> you re&s;olv'd to live in? Mon&s;trous! Perfidious!</P>
<P N="3">3. They cannot &s;ay, they are not <HI>Per&s;ecuted;</HI> Per&s;ecution is the <HI>Con&s;training</HI> and <HI>Re&s;training Con&s;cience</HI> by Force and Puni&s;hment. To <HI>Re&s;train from</HI> what we dare not <HI>Omit,</HI> is as much Per&s;ecution, as to <HI>Con&s;train</HI> to what we dare not <HI>Comply with.</HI> Can any <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Omit In&s;tructing his Children in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religi|on? Dare</HI> any <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> Educate his Child in that Way which he dares not Conform to him&s;elf? Is not that Condemning him&s;elf, and Abandoning his Child? Does he not, by that &s;ingle Act, either declare that he <HI>Di&s;sents</HI> without any Foundation, or that he Values not the <HI>Salvation</HI> of his Child?</P>
<P>Con&s;cientious <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have never yet &s;hewn
<PB N="11" REF="10">
&s;uch an Indifferency in the Matter of Con|formity; if they had, they could not have been &s;uppos'd to Suffer &s;uch <HI>Hard&s;hips</HI> as they now do, to be expelled any Share either in the <HI>Tru&s;t, Honour,</HI> or <HI>Profits</HI> of their Country's Service.</P>
<P N="4">4. They cannot &s;ay, that they are at all oblig'd by this, to farther and future Services; and altho' it is true, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> may not withdraw their Hands from the Nece&s;&s;ary Services of their Country, as <HI>Engli&s;h Men,</HI> yet all tho&s;e Voluntary Services, which, upon all Occa&s;ions, they have appear'd Freely and Generou&s;ly to join in, they mu&s;t now Re&s;train, in Order to carry on the more needful Ex|pence of Educating and In&s;tructing their Chil|dren Abroad, and keeping Tutors for them in their own Hou&s;es, and in A&s;&s;i&s;ting Poor Families to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Affirmative</HI> Con&s;equences of their <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> which it is not &s;o proper to Men|tion, only I take the Freedom to tell the&s;e Warm People, that there will not one <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ter</HI>'s Child the more be brought up in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> by this <HI>Per&s;ecuting Act;</HI> neither will this Le&s;&s;en, but Encrea&s;e the <HI>Schi&s;m,</HI> and the Number of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>En|gland.</HI> It is true, it will &s;traiten the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> in their Educating their Children, put them to Difficulties and Expence. As to the fir&s;t, they mu&s;t Suffer it, as an Effect of <HI>Per&s;e|cution:</HI> And as to the la&s;t, the Money wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ch the <HI>Di&s;senters</HI> now freely&punc; Contribute to the <HI>Church,</HI> over and above what the Law demands, <HI>(viz.)</HI> on Sub&s;cription to <HI>Charities,</HI> to <HI>Lectu|rers,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
to <HI>Poor Clergy,</HI> to <HI>Briefs,</HI> &amp;c. Which it would be the greate&s;t Madne&s;s in the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI> not to Re&s;train: The&s;e, I &s;ay, will Pay all the Difference in the Expence of the Edu|cation of their Children, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them to Educate the Poor that cannot do it them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Again, &s;eeing the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> are &s;o Sen&s;ible of the Effect of our Schoolma&s;ters Teaching the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> Children the <HI>A&s;sem|blies</HI> Catechi&s;m, that they &s;hould make a Law that they &s;hall not be In&s;tructed in that man|ner at School, it is a Warm Admonition to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to Revive the Ancient Family Di&s;cipline and In&s;truction, which was the O|riginal Method by which the Reformation was begun in this Nation; and by duly Catechi|&s;ing their own Children and Servants, and giving Catechi&s;es to the Poor Families that want them, effectually &s;upply the Deffect; and thus the End of the&s;e <HI>Church Chri&s;tians</HI> (viz.) to le&s;&s;en <HI>Chri&s;tian Knowledge,</HI> in&s;tead of encrea&s;ing it, &s;hall be Defeated, till they think fit to make another Bill to take the <HI>Di&s;|&s;curers</HI> Children away from them, as the <HI>Pa|pi&s;ts</HI> did to the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> or as the <HI>Mahometans</HI> do now to the <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians <HI>Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rgia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> to make Janizaries.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the <HI>Inhumanity</HI> of this Law, which admits of a large De&s;cription, and which has many Branches Tending to <HI>Cruelty,</HI> cannot but fill the Minds of our Po&s;terity with Abhorrence of the Church it &s;elf, and &s;o make the Breach wider than ever it was before: As all the Sangninary Laws again&s;t the Refor|mation,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
and again&s;t the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> could never &s;top the Progre&s;s either of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion at fir&s;t, or of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion afterwards, &s;o neither will this, but will Confirm, E&s;tabli&s;h, and Encrea&s;e the Bo|dy of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this Nation. To con|clude all,</P>
<P>The Methods which will al&s;o be &s;till le&s;s to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to evade this Act, will of Cour&s;e have one of the&s;e two Effects; either, which we earne&s;tly wi&s;h, it will cau&s;e the Church to &s;ee the Mi&s;take, and Repeal the Rigorous Law; or, as tho&s;e who run into many Evils, to Support, and rather than Recant the fir&s;t, it will oblige them to &s;uch other and farther Steps of this Kind, as mu&s;t revive the &s;evere&s;t Per&s;e|cutions, even to Death and Torture; the Con|&s;equences we may rea&s;onably expect will end in Judgment from Heaven, and the Confu&s;ion of the Nation.</P>
<P>We cannot but hope that the&s;e Things may prevail with our Legi&s;lators to con&s;ider what is before them, and to examine as well the <HI>Political</HI> as the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Arguments which may be offer'd to them again&s;t this <HI>Bill.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly, how it &s;trikes at the Founda|tion of Religion, as Chri&s;tian, and tends to the De&s;troying the Light and Knowledge of Divine Things in the World, which is the Ho|nour of the Reformation: Whereas, if the In|&s;truction of Children in the Knowledge of Re|ligion is re&s;train'd, loaded with Difficulties, or limited, it is thereby di&s;couraged, le&s;&s;en'd and put backward, which is contrary to the Prac|tice of all the <HI>Prote&s;tant Nations</HI> in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Neither is it enough to &s;ay, That the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> are the Cau&s;e of &s;uch Di&s;couragement, for that they may &s;end their Children to Learn the <HI>Church Catechi&s;m,</HI> and to <HI>Church Tutors</HI> and <HI>School-ma&s;ters.</HI> For if the Di&s;&s;enters can|not in Con&s;cience Conform, neither can they in Con&s;cience teach their Children to Conform; and if that Principle, <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> obliges them to keep their Children without any Degree of Learning and In&s;truction, which they would otherwi&s;e have had; the Law that limits their Education to Terms which their Parents can|not comply with, is the unrighteous Cau&s;e of that Defect, and thus Ignorance flows in of Cour&s;e. It is to be hop'd, the <HI>Church of Eng|land</HI> will not be thought to plant it &s;elf be&s;t in the Ignorance of the People. Chri&s;tian Knowledge is the Fountain of the Reforma|tion of the Chri&s;tian Religion. <HI>Popery,</HI> indeed, may be &s;aid to be <HI>Founded</HI> in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>propagated</HI> in <HI>Super&s;tition,</HI> which is the Child of Stupidity and Blindne&s;s. But <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and the Light of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> were the Nur|&s;es and Founders of the Reformation; and Woe be to that Nation, or People, or Body of Men, who pretend to propagate the Chri&s;ti|an Religion by Re&s;training the Knowledge of Religion in the Minds of the Younger Part of the Nation, who it is their Duty by all po&s;&s;i|ble Means to In&s;truct.</P>
<P>We find in the Heads of the <HI>Bill</HI> now De|pending, &s;ome Things al&s;o more particularly Tending to Per&s;ecution than is yet mention'd <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Engaging every one who &s;hall have a Licen&s;e to Teach School, never to be

<HEAD>QUERIES Humbly Propos'd to My LORDS the BISHOPS, upon Occa&s;ion of the BILL now Depending in the HOUSE of PEERS, to prevent (as is pleaded) <HI>The Growth of Schi&s;m.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Query</HI> I. HOW <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> can be prevented, before 'tis clearly determined what it is? And whether tho&s;e Men canju&s;tly be charged with it, who are united to the Com|mon Head of the Chri&s;tian Church by <HI>Faith,</HI> and to all its Members by an hearty <HI>Love?</HI> And whether Di&s;&s;enters are not within the <HI>Church,</HI> as it is defin'd by the 19th Article of the <HI>Church of England;</HI> having <HI>the pure Word of God preach'd among&s;t them, and the Sacraments duly admini&s;tred according to Chri&s;t's Ordinance, in all Things that of Nece&s;&s;ity are requi&s;ite to the &s;ame?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. HOW any National Church, as far as it is favour'd or warranted by the Holy Scrip|tures, which all Prote&s;tants own for their Rule, can be in any Real Danger from &s;uch Per&s;ons
<PB N="35" REF="34">
as tho&s;e de&s;crib'd, or from their being left at Liberty to Educate their Children in their own Way?</P>
<P N="3">III. WHETHER it be not a Piece of Wi&s;dom to learn from our Enemies? And when even in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Communion, notwith&s;tanding their High Preten&s;ions to <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity,</HI> there is yet a great Diver&s;ity admit|ted among&s;t their Religious Orders, why &s;hould not <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> inlarge and &s;trengthen them&s;elves, by enclo&s;ing All they can, in a Way of Forbearance, e&s;pecially when they hearti|ly fall in with the &s;ame Civil Government?</P>
<P N="4">IV. ARE not the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Prote|&s;tant Churches (to our great Satisfaction) al|lowed to Educate their own Children, without Di&s;honour or Damage to the Church or State? And &s;hall this Privilege be deny'd to Natives, that are Faithful and Peaceable, meerly be|cau&s;e they are Di&s;&s;enters?</P>
<P N="5">V. WHETHER the treating &s;uch as <HI>Schi&s;|maticks</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. (to look no farther back) was not &s;en&s;ibly found to promote the <HI>Growth of Popery?</HI> And whe|ther it may not rea&s;onably be expected, that a like Cau&s;e &s;hould have a like Effect?</P>
<P N="6">VI. WHETHER in the Reign that &s;ucceed|ed, it was not own'd by &s;ome Eminent Prelates of the Church, with Archbi&s;hop <HI>Sancroft</HI> at their Head, as well as by the Noble Marque&s;s of <HI>Halifax,</HI> in his <HI>Letter to the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> (in which &s;o many eminent Per&s;ons concurred, and which all at that Time applauded,) that too much Rigour had been us'd towards Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Religion, for differing in &s;maller
<PB N="36" REF="35">
Matters? And whether Promi&s;es were not then freely made, of a different Treatment and a better Temper for the Future, from the Pulpit and the Pre&s;s, and in all Conver&s;ation?</P>
<P N="7">VII. WHETHER the Bi&s;hops that have been advanc'd to that Honour &s;ince the <HI>Revo|lution,</HI> who have generally been Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Eminence for their Worth and Mo|deration, have not met with more Re&s;pect from the Di&s;&s;enters, than from many who pre|tended to be zealous Members of their own Church? And whether it is a &s;uitable Return for Per&s;ons of their Lord&s;hips Candour, to deal more hardly by us as to our Children, than their Predece&s;&s;ors ever attempted to do by our Fa|thers, as to their De&s;cendants?</P>
<P N="8">VIII. WHETHER any Thing more tender|ly affected the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France,</HI> than the denying them Liberty to Educate their Chil|dren in their own Principles? And whether that Method which has all along been repre|&s;ented as &s;o &s;evere in a <HI>Popi&s;h Prince,</HI> can ne|ver be fit to be countenanced by <HI>Prote&s;tant Bi|&s;hops,</HI> in a <HI>Prote&s;tant Country?</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. WHETHER if <HI>Popery</HI> &s;hould once more prevail among us, which &s;ome who are Orna|ments to the Bench of Bi&s;hops have owned to be no very remote Suppo&s;ition, it would be a mo&s;t grating Reflection when the Legi&s;lators &s;hould demand the Education of the Children of all <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> to hear them in&s;inuate, That their Lord&s;hips had &s;et them the Pattern, by demanding the Education of the Children of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters?</HI></P>
<P N="10"><PB N="37" REF="36">
X. WHETHER it can rea&s;onably be ex|pected that they &s;hould ever have the Courage to endure the Fiery Trial, (which is what, ac|cording to the foregoing Suppo&s;ition they may be called to) who, by any Political Con&s;idera|tions, &s;hould be kept from &s;heltring the Inno|cent? And whether upon Suppo&s;ition any Members of their own Church &s;hould threaten them, if they acted according to the Princi|ples by which they obtained their Preferments, it would not be more becoming to inform them better, and yield more Comfort to &s;et them an Example of Steadine&s;s, than to harden and embolden them, by yielding to them in a Me|thod of treating Brethren, that is neither Scrip|tural nor Rational?</P>
<P N="11">XI. WHETHER it be &s;eemly for Guides of the Church, to pa&s;s &s;uch a Cen&s;ure upon the <HI>A&s;&s;emblie</HI>'s <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> as if it were not fit to be Taught, when there is nothing to be found in it, but what agrees with the Doctrine, and nothing that is oppo&s;ite to the Government of their own Church? And how it can be recon|cil'd with the Honour and Veracity of their Lord&s;hips to allow no other Catechi&s;m than that, which cannot be an&s;wer'd to with Truth by the Children of Di&s;&s;enters, who had no Godfathers or Godmothers to give them their Names, or promi&s;e for them?</P>
<P N="12">XII. WHETHER the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts</HI> have not from the fir&s;t Reformation been own'd a great Grievance by the be&s;t Prelates and Mem|bers of the <HI>Church of England?</HI> Whether they have not upon Occa&s;ion been freely inveigh'd again&s;t, by many who are at pre&s;ent on the
<PB N="38" REF="37">
Bi&s;hops bench? And, Whether there be any &s;uch Evidence of their Amendment, as can ju&s;tify their now concurring to &s;upport and in courage them?</P>
<P>AND, La&s;tly, WHETHER the pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a Bill into a Law, be not more likely to &s;pread Animo&s;ity, increa&s;e Uncharitablene&s;s, and perpetuate Divi&s;ion, than prevent the Growth of what is call'd <HI>Schi&s;m?</HI> And, Whether this be not as evident, as that publickly branding a Body of Men, will inflame the Populace again&s;t them; and that Severity on the other Hand tends to exa&s;perate the Sufferers?</P>
<P><HI>My Lords the Bi&s;hops are earne&s;tly re|que&s;ted to take the&s;e Things into their &s;erious Con&s;ideration, by &s;everal of the De&s;cendants of tho&s;e very</HI> Pre&s;|byterians, <HI>who earne&s;tly ( tho' in|vain) implor'd the Compa&s;&s;ion of their Predece&s;&s;ors in</HI> 1661; <HI>and by many that have join'd with them in waiting for the fulfilling their Pro|mi&s;es in</HI> 1687 <HI>and</HI> 1688: <HI>And who mo&s;t heartily beg of Almighty GOD, they may never fall into the &s;ame Ex|tremities, or wor&s;e, by having our Common Hopes, which depend upon the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion in the Illu&s;|trious Hou&s;e of</HI> HANOVER, <HI>defea|ted, according to &s;ome Mens De&s;ires and Wi&s;hes, which we pray may never take Effect.</HI></P>
