<HEAD>THE EULOGIES OF HOWARD.</HEAD>
<P>IT was my chance to be conver&s;ing with a Friend of the benevolent and indefatigable HOWARD, when our coun|try was fir&s;t afflicted with the public in|telligence of his death. After our fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urprize and &s;orrow, we naturally fell into &s;erious and affectionate reflections on the gentle character and &s;ublime pur&s;uits of the decea&s;ed. On the&s;e articles we had no difference of opinion; but in the cour&s;e of our con|ver&s;ation a point aro&s;e, on which our
<PB N="2" REF="4">
&s;entiments were directly oppo&s;ite, though we were equally &s;incere and ardent in our regret and veneration for the de|parted Worthy, to whom it related. I happened to &s;peak of the public ho|nours that, I hoped, a grateful, a ge|nerous, a magnificent Nation would ren|der to his memory. My companion im|mediately exclaimed, "that every os|tentatious memorial, to commemorate the virtues of his friend, would be in|con&s;i&s;tent with the meekne&s;s and &s;im|plicity of the man; that all, who had the happine&s;s of knowing HOWARD, mu&s;t recollect with what genuine mo|de&s;ty he had ever retired from the en|thu&s;ia&s;tic admiration of tho&s;e, who had hoped to gratify his ambition by unde|&s;erved applau&s;e; that he had really &s;ought no reward but in the approbation
<PB N="3" REF="5">
of his con&s;cience and his GOD; that the Briti&s;h Nation, however eminent for ge|nius and munificence, could not devi&s;e any po&s;thumous honours, or rai&s;e any monument, truly worthy of HOWARD, except in adopting and accompli&s;hing tho&s;e benevolent projects which his phi|lanthropy and experience had recom|mended to public attention for the be|nefit of mankind."</P>
<P>I readily admitted the &s;ingular and unque&s;tionable mode&s;ty of the decea&s;ed. &mdash;I allowed that the noble&s;t tribute of re&s;pect, which the world could render to &s;o pure a &s;pirit, would be to realize his ideas; but I contended, that other ho|nours are &s;till due to his name; that it is the duty and the intere&s;t of mankind to commemorate his character with the fonde&s;t veneration. I reminded my com|panion,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
that although we were &s;incerely convinced that no human mind, engaged in great de&s;igns, could be more truly mode&s;t than that of HOWARD; yet we had particular rea&s;on to recollect, that he was not in&s;en&s;ible to prai&s;e. He had once imparted to us his feelings on that &s;ubject with a frank and tender &s;impli|city, highly graceful in an upright and magnanimous being, con&s;cious of no &s;en|timent that he could wi&s;h to conceal. Indeed, a &s;incere and ardent pa&s;&s;ion for virtue could hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t with a di&s;dain of true glory, which is nothing more than the proper te&s;timony of intelligent and hone&s;t admiration to the exi&s;tence of merit: nor is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the fonde&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of remem|brance from a world, which he has &s;erved and enlightened, can be di&s;|plea&s;ing
<PB N="5" REF="7">
to the &s;pirit of "a ju&s;t man made perfect;" &s;ince we are taught by Religion, that the gratitude of mankind is acceptable even to GOD. I endeavoured to convince my companion, that, as the Publick had &s;een in HOWARD a per&s;on who reflected more genuine honour on our country than any of her Philo&s;o|phers, her Poets, her Orators, her He|roes, or Divines, it is incumbent on the Nation to con&s;ult her own glory by com|memorating, in the fulle&s;t manner, his beneficent exertions, and by e&s;tabli&s;hing the dignity of his unrivaled virtue.</P>
<P>My arguments, and my zeal, made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of my an|tagoni&s;t; and &s;unk &s;o deeply into my own, that on my retiring to re&s;t they gave ri&s;e to the following vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was &s;uddenly tran&s;ported to the con|fines of a region, which a&s;toni&s;hed me
<PB N="6" REF="8">
by its loveline&s;s and extent; it was called, The Paradi&s;e of true Glory. As I ap|proached the entrance, my eyes were delightfully fa&s;cinated by two beings of human form, who pre&s;ided over the por|tal. Their names were Genius and Sen&s;ibility:&mdash;it was their office to gratify with a view of this Paradi&s;e every mor|tal that revered them &s;incerely; and to reject only &s;uch intruders as pre&s;umed to treat either the one or the other with the in&s;olence of di&s;dain, or the coldne&s;s of contempt: an incident that I &s;hould have thought impo&s;&s;ible, from the tran|&s;cendent beauty which is vi&s;ible in each; but, to my &s;urprize, they informed me it very frequently happened.</P>
<P>As I readily paid them the un&s;u&s;pect|ed homage of my &s;oul, I was graciou&s;ly permitted to pa&s;s the gate.&mdash;Immediately
<PB N="7" REF="9">
as I entered, I was &s;aluted with a &s;e|raphic &s;mile, by two benignant and in&s;e|parable Spirits: the&s;e were Gratitude and Admiration, the joint rulers of the do|minion &mdash;"You are welcome," &s;aid the fir&s;t, in a tone of angelic tenderne&s;s&mdash; "You are welcome to a &s;cene utterly new to your &s;en&s;es, and in harmony with your heart: you delight in the prai&s;es of the de&s;erving: and you are now wafted to a &s;pot, where tho&s;e who have merited highly of mankind are prai&s;ed in pro|portion to their de&s;ert, and where the prai&s;e of exalted merit is fondly li&s;tened to by an exten&s;ive human audience, here purified by our &s;upernatural agency from all the low and little jealou&s;ies of the earth."</P>
<P>I had hardly an&s;wered this plea&s;ing information by a grateful obei&s;ance to
<PB N="8" REF="10">
my radiant informer, when I perceived, in a gorgeous pro&s;pect that now opened before us, three &s;tructures of &s;tupendous &s;ize and &s;uperior magnificence. The fir&s;t was &s;ituated in a grove of olives, and appeared to me like an ancient tem|ple of Attica, remarkable for ma&s;&s;ive &s;trength, and a &s;ober dignity&mdash;the &s;econd was le&s;s &s;olid, but richer in decoration; and &s;eemed to be almo&s;t &s;urrounded by every tree and plant on which Nature has be&s;towed any &s;alutary virtue: the third was &s;haded only by palms; the form of it was &s;o wonderfully grand and aweful, that it &s;truck me as a &s;anctuary for every pure and devout &s;pirit from all the nations of the globe.</P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;tructures, that you &s;urvey with a&s;toni&s;hment," &s;aid one of my be|nevolent conductors, "are devoted to
<PB N="9" REF="11">
what you mortals denominate the three liberal profe&s;&s;ions, Law, Medicine, and Theology. Whoever has a claim to di&s;tin|gui&s;hed honour from any one of the three, has a ju&s;t encomium pronounced upon his &s;ervices by the temporary Pre&s;ident of that particular fabrick, in which he is entitled to &s;uch grateful remembrance." "Alas!" I replied, with a murmur that I could not &s;uppre&s;s, "the Man who&s;e well-de&s;erved prai&s;es I mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly expected to hear in this region, be|longed not to any one of the&s;e eminent cla&s;&s;es in human life&mdash;he had no pro|fe&s;&s;ion but that of Humanity."</P>
<P>"Be patient," &s;aid the &s;weete&s;t of my aetherial guides, with a rebuke that was &s;oftened by a &s;mile of indulgence! "Let not your zeal for the honour of an indi|vidual, however meritorious, make you
<PB N="10" REF="12">
unju&s;t, or in&s;en&s;ible, to the merit of others! A&s;&s;ume the temper of this re|gion, where prai&s;e is di&s;tributed by equity and affection, but where prejudice and partiality are not allowed to intrude!&mdash; Let us advance," continued my monitor, with an encouraging movement of her hand; "it is time that I &s;hould lead you to the neare&s;t a&s;&s;embly."</P>
<P>I obeyed with reverential &s;ilence; and as I pa&s;&s;ed the ve&s;tibule of the maje&s;tic edifice, my heart panted with an aweful expectation of beholding the &s;hades of Solon, Lycurgus, and other departed Legi&s;lators, from the various nations of the world. I was chearfully &s;urprized by a very different &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>The capacious &s;tructure was filled with a concour&s;e of living mortals, live|ly, yet re&s;pectable in their appearance,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
evidently belonging to many countries; but all, as I perceived by their habits, connected with the Law. Throughout all the multitude I heard no &s;ound of di&s;&s;ention or debate: but over all there reigned an air of intelligence and &s;ym|pathy, while all were hu&s;hed in &s;ilent ex|pectance, and eager attention, with their eyes directed to an elevated tribunal:&mdash; On this a per&s;onage was &s;itting, who&s;e maje&s;tic figure I immediately recollect|ed. His countenance is marked with that au&s;terity and grandeur, which are the external characteri&s;ticks of Law her|&s;elf. His heart, as tho&s;e who know it intimately declare, expre&s;&s;es the tender and beneficent influence of that Power, who is the acknowledged parent of &s;e|curity and comfort. With a voice that pervaded the mo&s;t di&s;tant rece&s;&s;es of the
<PB N="12" REF="14">
exten&s;ive dome, and in tones that &s;unk deep into the bo&s;om of every auditor, he pronounced the following oration:</P>
<P>"After pa&s;&s;ing many years of life in the painful inve&s;tigation of human of|fences, it is with peculiar &s;atisfaction that I find my&s;elf commi&s;&s;ioned to com|memorate, in this A&s;&s;embly, a character of virtue without example&mdash;a character, at once &s;o meek and &s;o &s;ublime, that, if a feeling &s;pirit had been poi&s;oned with mi&s;anthropy from too clo&s;e a contem|plation of mortal crimes, this character alone might &s;erve as an antidote to the wor&s;t of mental di&s;tempers, and awaken the mo&s;t callous and &s;arca&s;tic mind to confe&s;s the dignity of our Nature, and the beneficence of our God. In &s;tating to you the merits of HOWARD, I might expatiate with delight on the various
<PB N="13" REF="15">
qualities of this incomparable man; I might trace his progre&s;s through the different periods of a life always &s;ingu|lar and always in&s;tructive. I could not be checked by any fear of over&s;tepping the mode&s;ty of Truth in the celebration of Virtue, &s;o &s;olid and &s;o exten&s;ive, that the malevolence of Envy could not di|mini&s;h its weight, the fondne&s;s of Enthu|&s;iam could not amplify its effects. But I mu&s;t not forget that there are pro|fe&s;&s;ional limits to my di&s;cour&s;e. It is incumbent on me to confine my&s;elf to a &s;ingle object, and to dwell only on tho&s;e public &s;ervices, that peculiarly endear the name of HOWARD to the liberal and enlightened community in which I have the honour to pre&s;ide.</P>
<P>"It was in the capacity of a Mini&s;ter to Ju&s;tice, that the pure &s;pirit, whom it
<PB N="14" REF="16">
is my glory to prai&s;e, fir&s;t conceived the idea of tho&s;e unrivaled labours that have rendered his memory a trea&s;ure to man|kind. In di&s;charging a temporary office, that expo&s;ed to him the condition of criminals, he was led to meditate on the evils which had grievou&s;ly contamina|ted the operations of Ju&s;tice. He per|ceived that Law her&s;elf, like one of her mo&s;t illu&s;trious Delegates (I mean the immortal Bacon), was gro&s;sly injured by the &s;ecret and &s;ordid enormities of her menial &s;ervants: that Captivity and Co|ercion, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary &s;upporters of her power, in&s;tead of producing good, often gave birth to mi&s;chiefs more flagrant, and more fatal, than tho&s;e which they were employed to correct. He found, even in the pri&s;ons of his own humane and enlightened country, an accumula|tion
<PB N="15" REF="17">
of the mo&s;t hideous abu&s;es: he found them not nur&s;eries of penitence and amendment, but &s;chools of vice and impiety; or dens of filth, famine, and di&s;ea&s;e: not the &s;eats of ju&s;t and &s;alu|tary correction and puni&s;hment, but the &s;trong holds of cruelty and extortion. The irons of the pri&s;oner, which he only beheld, entered into his &s;oul, and awakened unextingui&s;hable energy in a &s;pirit, of which compa&s;&s;ion and fortitude were the divine characteri&s;ticks. In the noble emotions of pity for the oppre&s;&s;ed, and of zeal for the honour and intere&s;t of civilized &s;ociety, he conceived per|haps the &s;ublime&s;t de&s;ign that ever oc|cupied and exalted the mind of man, the de&s;ign to &s;earch and to purify the polluted &s;tream of Penal Ju&s;tice, not only throughout his own country, but through
<PB N="16" REF="18">
the various nations of the world. How low, how little, are the grande&s;t enter|prizes of Heroic Ambition, when com|pared with this magnanimous pur&s;uit! How frivolous and vain are the highe&s;t aims of Fancy and Science, when con|tra&s;ted with a purpo&s;e &s;o beneficently great! But, marvellous as the magnitude of HOWARD's enterpri&s;e appears, on the &s;lighte&s;t view that magnitude be|comes doubly &s;triking, when we con|template at the &s;ame time the many circum&s;tances that might either allure or deter him from the pro&s;ecution of his idea. Con&s;ider him as a private gentle|man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ea&s;e and independence, accu&s;tomed to employ and amu&s;e his mind in retired &s;tudy and philo&s;ophical &s;peculation; arrived at that period of life, when the &s;prings of activity and
<PB N="17" REF="19">
enterprize in the human frame have be|gun to lo&s;e their force! con&s;ider that his health, even in youth, had appeared un|equal to common fatigue! his &s;tature low! his deportment humble! his voice almo&s;t effeminate! Such was the won|derful being, who relinqui&s;hed the re|tirement, the tranquillity, the comforts, that he loved and enjoyed, to embark in labours at which the mo&s;t hardy might tremble; to plunge in perils from which the mo&s;t re&s;olute might recede without a diminution of honour. Under all the&s;e apparent di&s;advantages, un&s;um|moned, unauthorized by any Prince, un|excited by any popular invitation, he re|&s;olved to inve&s;tigate all the abu&s;es of im|pri&s;onment; to vi&s;it the abodes of wretchedne&s;s and infection; and to prove him&s;elf the friend of the friendle&s;s, in
<PB N="18" REF="20">
every country that the limits of his ad|vanced life would allow him to examine. Again&s;t &s;uch an enterprize, projected by &s;uch an individual, what forcible argu|ments might be urged, not only by eve|ry &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, but even by that pru|dence, and that rea&s;on, which are allow|ed to regulate an elevated mind! How plau&s;ibly did Friend&s;hip exclaim to HOWARD, 'Your projects are unque&s;|tionably noble; but they are above the execution of any individual: you are unarmed with authority; you have the wi&s;h to do great good, but the power of doing little! Con&s;ider the probable i&s;&s;ue of the undertaking!&mdash;You will &s;ee a few haple&s;s wretches, and tell their condition to the inattentive world; per|haps peri&s;h your&s;elf from contagion, be|fore you have time to tell it; and leave
<PB N="19" REF="21">
your afflicted friends to lament your un|timely fate, and the ungrateful Publick to deride your temerity!' What force of intellect, what dignity of &s;oul were required to prevent a mortal from yield|ing to remon&s;trances &s;o engaging! The divine energy of Genius and of Virtue enabled HOWARD to fore&s;ee, that the &s;anctity of his pur&s;uit would &s;upply him with &s;trength and powers far &s;uperior to all human authority:&mdash;His piercing mind comprehended that there are enormities of &s;uch a nature, that to &s;urvey and to reveal them is to effect their correction. &mdash;He felt that his &s;incere compa&s;&s;ion for the oppre&s;&s;ed, and his ardent de&s;ire to promote perfect ju&s;tice, would &s;erve him as a perpetual antidote again&s;t the poi|&s;on of fear.&mdash;He felt that in the dark|ne&s;s of dungeons he &s;hould want no a&s;|&s;ociates,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
no guards to defend him again&s;t the outrages of detected extortion, or &s;u&s;picious brutality.&mdash;He felt, that as his purpo&s;e was heavenly, the powers of Heaven would be di&s;played in his &s;up|port; that iniquity and oppre&s;&s;ion would not dare to lift a hand again&s;t him, though they knew it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to annihilate their &s;way in their mo&s;t &s;ecret dominion. How admirably did the progre&s;s of his travels evince and ju&s;tify the pure and enlightened confidence of his &s;pirit! All dangers, all difficul|ties, vani&s;h before his gentlene&s;s, his re|gularity, his per&s;everance. In&s;olence and ferocity &s;eem to turn, at his ap|proach, into docility and re&s;pect. Every hard&s;hip he endures, every &s;tep he ad|vances, in his wide and laborious career of Beneficence, in&s;tead of impairing his
<PB N="21" REF="23">
&s;trength, invigorates his frame; in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing his influence, increa&s;es the utility of his conduct, by making the world acquainted with the &s;anctity of his character. Witne&s;s, ye various regions of the earth! with what &s;urprize, delight, and veneration, ye beheld an un|armed, and una&s;&s;uming traveller in&s;truct|ing you in the &s;ublime &s;cience of miti|gating human mi&s;ery, and giving you a matchle&s;s example of tenderne&s;s and magnanimity! O, England! thou ge|nerous country! ever enamoured of glory, contemplate in this, the mo&s;t perfect of thy illu&s;trious &s;ons; contem|plate tho&s;e virtues, and that honour, in which thy parental &s;pirit may mo&s;t hap|pily exult!&mdash;What &s;pectacle can be more flattering to thy native, thy hone&s;t pride, than to behold the proude&s;t potentates
<PB N="22" REF="24">
of di&s;tant nations li&s;tening with plea|&s;ure to a private Engli&s;hman; and learn|ing, from his re&s;earches, how to relieve the mo&s;t injured of their &s;ubjects! how to aboli&s;h the enormities of perverted Ju&s;tice! To form a complete account of the good ari&s;ing to the world from the life and labours of HOWARD, would be a ta&s;k beyond the limits of any hu|man mind: an exact &s;tatement of the benefits he has conferred upon &s;ociety, could be rendered only by the attendant Spirit whom Providence commi&s;&s;ioned to watch over him, and who might di&s;|cern, by the powers of &s;upernatural vi|&s;ion, what pregnant &s;ources of public calamity he cru&s;hed in the &s;eed, and what future virtues, in various indivi|duals, he may draw into the &s;ervice of mankind by the attraction of his exam|ple.
<PB N="23" REF="25">
Of good, more immediately vi&s;i|ble, which his exertions produced, there is abundant evidence in his own coun|try. In the wide circle of his foreign excur&s;ion, what nation, what city, does not bear &s;ome con&s;picuous traces of his intrepid and indefatigable beneficence! Of the a&s;toni&s;hing length to which his zeal and per&s;everance extended, we have the mo&s;t ingenuous and &s;atisfactory nar|ration in tho&s;e &s;ingularly meritorious volumes which he has given to the world. In the&s;e we behold the minute detail of labours to which there is no|thing &s;imilar, or &s;econd, in the hi&s;tory of public virtue; and for which there could be no adequate reward but in the beatitude of Heaven. An eloquent En|thu&s;ia&s;t, who&s;e genius was nearly allied to frenzy, has expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to pre|&s;ent
<PB N="24" REF="26">
him&s;elf before the tribunal of the Almighty Judge, with a volume in his hand, in which he had recorded his own thoughts and actions: if &s;uch an idea could be &s;uitable to the littlene&s;s of man, if it could become any mortal of facul|ties &s;o limited to make &s;uch an offering to the great Fountain of all intelligence, that mortal mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be HOWARD: for where could we find another indi|vidual, not profe&s;&s;edly in&s;pired, who might pre&s;ent to his Maker a record of labours &s;o eminently directed by Piety and Virtue! a book, addre&s;&s;ed to man|kind, without in&s;ulting their weakne&s;s, or flattering their pa&s;&s;ions! a book, who&s;e great object was to benefit the world, without &s;eeking from it any kind of reward! a book, in which the ge|nuine mode&s;ty of the Writer is equal to
<PB N="25" REF="27">
his unexampled beneficence! The mind of HOWARD was &s;ingularly and &s;ub|limely free from the common and dan|gerous pa&s;&s;ion for applau&s;e: that pa&s;&s;ion which, though taken altogether, it is cer|tainly beneficial to the intere&s;ts of man|kind, yet frequently communicates in|quietude and un&s;teadine&s;s to the pur&s;uits of Genius and Virtue. As human prai&s;e was never the object of his ambition, &s;o he has nobly &s;oared above it. There ap|pear, in different ages upon the Earth, certain elevated &s;pirits, who, by the &s;ub|limity of their conceptions, and the mag|nanimity of their conduct, attain a de|gree of glory which can never be reach|ed by the keene&s;t followers of Fame.&mdash; They &s;eek not panegyricks; and pane|gyricks can add nothing to their honour. The Eulogies have peri&s;hed which were
<PB N="26" REF="28">
devoted by the luxuriant genius of Tul|ly, and by the laconic &s;pirit of Brutus, to the public virtue of CATO; yet the name of that illu&s;trious Roman is &s;till power|ful in the world, and excites in every cultivated mind, an animating idea of independent integrity. The name of HOWARD has &s;uperior force, and a hap|pier effect. It is a &s;ound, at which the &s;trings of humanity will vibrate with exultation in many millions of hearts. Through the various nations that he vi&s;ited, the mere echo of his name will be &s;ufficient to awaken that noble&s;t &s;en|&s;ibility, which at once &s;oftens and ele|vates the &s;oul. Every warm-hearted and worthy individual who mentions HOW|ARD will glow with an hone&s;t, a ge|nerous &s;atisfaction, in feeling him&s;elf the fellow-creature of &s;uch a man. Where|ever
<PB N="27" REF="29">
the elegant arts are e&s;tabli&s;hed, they will contend in rai&s;ing memorials to his honour. Indeed, the globe it&s;elf may be con&s;idered as his Mau&s;oleum; and the inhabitants of every pri&s;on it con|tains, as groups of living &s;tatues that commemorate his virtue. There is no cla&s;s of mankind by whom his memory ought not to be cheri&s;hed, becau&s;e all are intere&s;ted in tho&s;e evils (&s;o perni|cious to &s;ociety! &s;o dangerous to life!) which he was ever labouring to le&s;|&s;en or exterminate. It might be wi&s;hed, that different communities &s;hould &s;epa|rately devi&s;e &s;ome different tribute of re&s;|pect to him who&s;e character and conduct is &s;o intere&s;ting to all: not for the &s;ake of multiplying vain and u&s;ele&s;s offerings to the dead, but to impre&s;s with more energy and extent his ennobling remembrance on

do our&s;elves more honour as a Fraternity than by con&s;idering HOWARD as an A&s;&s;ociate: a&s;&s;uredly, there is no cla&s;s of men who may more ju&s;tly pre&s;ume to cheri&s;h his name and character with a fraternal affection. In proportion as we are accu&s;tomed to contemplate, to pity, and to counteract, the &s;ufferings of Nature, the more are we enabled and inclined to e&s;timate, to love, and to re|vere, a being &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate and bene|ficent. If Phy&s;icians are, what I once heard them called by a lively friend, the Soldiers of Humanity, engaged in a per|petual, and too often, alas! un&s;ucce&s;sful conflict again&s;t the enemies of life; HOWARD is not only entitled to high rank in our corps, but he is the very Cae&s;ar of this hard, this perilous, and, let me add, this mo&s;t honourable war|fare.
<PB N="33" REF="35">
Perhaps the ambition of the great Roman Commander, in&s;atiate and &s;an|guinary as it was, did not contribute more to the torment and de&s;truction of the human race, than the charity of the Engli&s;h Philanthropi&s;t has contributed to its relief and pre&s;ervation. Of this we are very certain, the &s;plendid and inde|fatigable Hero of Slaughter and Vain|glory did not traver&s;e a more exten&s;ive field, nor expo&s;e him&s;elf more cou|rageou&s;ly to per&s;onal danger, than our meek and uno&s;tentatious Hero of Medical Benevolence. In point of true magnanimity, I apprehend the &s;pirit of Cae&s;ar would very willingly confe&s;s, that his own celebrated attempts to reduce Gaul and Britain were low and little atchievements, when compared to the unexampled efforts by which HOWARD
<PB N="34" REF="36">
endeavoured to exterminate or &s;ubdue (tho&s;e enemies more terrific) the Gaol Fever, and the Plague.</P>
<P>"But leaving it to more able and elo|quent panegyri&s;ts to celebrate the ori|ginality, the boldne&s;s, and all the various merit of his philanthropic exertions, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a few remarks, and chiefly profe&s;&s;ional ones, on his in|valuable character. It appears to me highly worthy of ob&s;ervation, that HOW|ARD, before he entered on his grand pro|jects of Public Benevolence, was &s;ub|ject to tho&s;e little, but depre&s;&s;ive varia|tions of health which have betrayed many a valetudinarian into habits of inaction and inutility. Happily for him|&s;elf, and for mankind, this excellent per&s;on &s;urmounted a con&s;titutional bias to indolence and retirement. The con|&s;equence
<PB N="35" REF="37">
was, he became a &s;ingular ex|ample of activity and vigour. His powers, and enjoyments of bodily and mental health, augmented in proportion to the exten&s;ive utility of his pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>"Beneficial as his life has been to the world, his memory may be &s;till more &s;o. It may prove a perpetual ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, if it di&s;&s;ipates, as it ought to do, a weak and common prejudice, which often operates as a pal&s;y upon the fir&s;t idea of a great and generous under|taking. The prejudice I mean is a ha&s;ty per&s;ua&s;ion, frequently found in the mo&s;t amiable minds, that &s;ome peculiar &s;trength of nerve, &s;ome rare mechani&s;m of frame, and extraordinary a&s;&s;emblage of mental powers, are ab&s;olutely requi|&s;ite for the execution of any noble de|&s;ign. How greatly does it redound to
<PB N="36" REF="38">
the true glory of HOWARD to have given in his &s;ucce&s;sful labours the fulle&s;t refu|tation of a prejudice, &s;o inimical to the intere&s;t and the honour of human-na|ture! a prejudice, by who&s;e influence, to u&s;e the words of our great Poet,
<Q><L>&mdash; The native hue of Re&s;olution</L>
<L>Is &s;icklied o'er with the pale ca&s;t of Fear,</L>
<L>And enterprizes of great pith and moment,</L>
<L>With this regard, their currents turn awry</L>
<L>And lo&s;e the name of action.</L></Q></P>
<P>"The life and character of HOWARD, if they are ju&s;tly con&s;idered, may not only annihilate this pernicious prejudice, but tend to e&s;tabli&s;h an oppo&s;ite and con|&s;olatory truth. His example may &s;hew us, that &s;ome degrees of bodily weak|ne&s;s and mental depre&s;&s;ion may be mo&s;t happily cured by active exertion in the
<PB N="37" REF="39">
&s;ervice of mankind. Perhaps there ne|ver exi&s;ted a more &s;triking proof how far a noble impul&s;e, communicated to the mind by a project of ex|ten&s;ive Benevolence, may invigorate a frame not equal in health, &s;trength, and &s;tature, to the common &s;tandard of men. It is a prudential maxim of the celebra|ted Raleigh, that "Who&s;oever will live altogether out of him&s;elf, and &s;tudy other men's humours, &s;hall never be un|fortunate;" a maxim, which the ex|ample of HOWARD might almo&s;t teach us to convert into a medical aphori&s;m, by &s;aying, "Who&s;oever will live alto|gether out of him&s;elf, and con&s;ult other men's wants, and calamities, &s;hall never be unhealthy." It is delightful to tho&s;e, who dete&s;t the deba&s;ing tenets of a &s;elf|i&s;h philo&s;ophy, to &s;ee the happy influence
<PB N="38" REF="40">
of oppo&s;ite ideas; to ob&s;erve (what Phy|&s;icians have frequent opportunities of ob&s;erving), that as a &s;elfi&s;h turn of mind often attracts and encrea&s;es the malig|nity of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;o an un&s;elfi&s;h, a com|pa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit has a natural tendency to e&s;cape or &s;ubdue it. What can be more plea&s;ing to tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;ert and e&s;teem the dignity of human-nature, than to &s;ee, that the having lo&s;t all thoughts of &s;elf, and having acted in direct oppo&s;ition to &s;elfi&s;h principles, has promoted even the per&s;onal advantage of a generous individual? From &s;uch a &s;eries of philanthropic labour and pe|ril, as a &s;elfi&s;h and timid mind might e&s;teem it frenzy to encounter, HOWARD derived not only his unrivalled and im|mortal reputation, but the perfect re&s;|toration of enfeebled health; not to
<PB N="39" REF="41">
mention tho&s;e high gratifications of the heart and con&s;cience, which are &s;uperior to all the enjoyments both of health and glory. With &s;uch temperance in diet, that his daily food would appear to mo&s;t people not &s;ufficient to &s;upport the com|mon functions of life, he chearfully &s;u&s;|tained the hard&s;hips of long travel, through regions where travelling is mo&s;t difficult and dangerous. With a figure, voice, and deportment, that &s;eemed to preclude him from all per&s;onal influence and authority; and with no mental ac|qui&s;itions, except tho&s;e which are com|mon to every cultivated mind, he &s;e|cured to him&s;elf not only univer&s;al ad|miration, but, I may venture to &s;ay, the ju&s;t and moral idolatry of the world. So invigorating are projects of exten&s;ive Beneficence! &s;o powerful is the energy of Public Virtue!</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">"Never, indeed, was the a&s;toni&s;hing influence of plain and &s;imple goodne&s;s more &s;trikingly di&s;played, than in the deference and re&s;pect which this private and meek individual received, not only from foreign and imperious Rulers of the Earth, but from hardened and atrocious wretches, on whom Ju&s;tice her&s;elf could hardly make any mental impre&s;&s;ion, though armed with all the &s;plendour, and all the violence of power. Two particular examples of the influence I am &s;peaking of, I &s;hall mention here, not only as honourable to the prime object of our regard, but as they may &s;ugge&s;t to contemplative minds &s;ome u&s;eful ideas, by &s;hewing how far the mere weight of an upright and benevolent character alone may give to the mo&s;t callous nerves a trembling &s;en&s;ibility, and awaken the

mo&s;t ferocious &s;pirit to &s;elf-correction.</P>
<P>"When our indefatigable Vi&s;itor of pri&s;ons was in Ru&s;&s;ia, he beheld, in pub|lic, the puni&s;hment of the knoot &s;everely admini&s;tered by a &s;trong and &s;tern execu|tioner.</P>
<P>"On the following day he waited on this man, to reque&s;t from him various information.

<P>"The &s;econd and more memorable example of his &s;ingular influence occur|red in a pri&s;on of his own country, and relates to an outrageous female delin|quent.
<PB N="42" REF="44">
A corrupt and ferocious woman is, perhaps, the mo&s;t intractable fiend that human benevolence can attempt to reform; but even this difficulty the mild and and powerful character of HOWARD accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>"In one of our We&s;tern gaols, he found an unhappy female loaded with heavy irons: on his appearance &s;he en|treated him to obtain for her the re|moval of the&s;e galling fetters. Upon enquiry, he found that many endeavours had been made to keep this turbulent offender in proper &s;ubjection without the &s;everity of chains; but, after repeated promi&s;es of amendment on milder treat|ment, &s;he had obliged the keeper to have recour&s;e to this extreme by re|lap&s;ing into the mo&s;t flagrant and in|&s;ufferable contempt of decency and or|der.
<PB N="43" REF="45">
Upon this information, HOWARD &s;aid mildly to the unhappy criminal, "I wi&s;h to relieve you, but you put it out of my power; for I &s;hould lo&s;e all the little credit I have, if I exerted it for offenders &s;o hardened and &s;o turbu|lent." "I know," replied the intracta|ble delinquent, "I know that I have a proud and rebellious &s;pirit; but if I give a promi&s;e to &s;o good a man as you are, I can and I will command it." On this firm a&s;&s;urance of reformation, the benevolent HOWARD became a kind of furety for her future peaceable conduct on the removal of her irons; and he had the inexpre&s;&s;ible delight to find, on his next vi&s;it to the pri&s;oners of this gaol, that the outrageous and ungovernable culprit, for whom he had ventured to an&s;wer, was become the mo&s;t orderly among them.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">"I could wi&s;h, for the moral intere&s;t of mankind, that it were po&s;&s;ible to ob|tain a minute account of the &s;ervices rendered to the calamitous &s;pirit of ma|ny a for&s;aken individual by the &s;ingular charity of HOWARD.

<P>"If we contemplate with plea&s;ure the &s;ingular re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of bodily health, which HOWARD derived from his active philanthropy; it may be &s;till more plea&s;ing to recollect, that it al&s;o afforded him an efficacious medicine for an afflicted mind.

In truth, this admirable Cha|racter &s;eemed to illu&s;trate the philo&s;o|phical maxim, that mildne&s;s is the proper companion of true magnanimity.

It is among the mo&s;t gracious ordinances of Providence, that man is &s;ure to find the mo&s;t power|ful relief for his own particular afflic|tions, in his endeavours to alleviate the &s;ufferings of others.

"I hope then," I eagerly replied, "I &s;hall have the de|light of hearing, on this occa&s;ion, the mo&s;t eloquent of our Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops." On this exclamation, my kind informer regarded me with that lively and &s;ooth|ing air with which intelligent Benevo|lence corrects mi&s;taken &s;implicity, and thus continued to in&s;truct me with uni|ted vivacity and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Earthly di&s;tinctions, you know, are of little moment in the &s;ight of Heaven. You will hear no Prelate; and perhaps you may feel &s;urpri&s;ed and indignant, when you ob&s;erve how very few of your Mitred Countrymen are to be &s;een in this

<P>"One of the&s;e," continued my Di|rector, "you are now going to hear; not, indeed, a Dignitary of your Church, yet a Divine of Talents, Learning, and Charity. He was led, by a laudable

<P>Many atchievements of beneficent Courage have undoubtedly been accom|pli&s;hed by men influenced by no motive but that generous love of glory which is &s;o frequently the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of an active and ardent mind: but the virtues that ari&s;e from this &s;ource are as un&s;teady, and as precarious, as the reward
<PB N="58" REF="60">
they pur&s;ue. He who acts only as a can|didate for the applau&s;e of mankind, will find his &s;pirit vary with all the variations in the ever-changing atmo&s;phere of po|pular opinion. He will be &s;ubject to hot and cold fits of action and inactivity, of confidence and di&s;tru&s;t, in proportion as the illu&s;ive vapour, that he follows, may either &s;parkle or fade before him. Hence proceeded much of that incon|&s;i&s;tency and weakne&s;s, which appear in &s;ome of the mo&s;t enlightened and exalt|ed characters of the Pagan world.&mdash; Wanting a purer light from Heaven, the mo&s;t radiant &s;pirits of antiquity were bewildered; one in particular, the mild|e&s;t and mo&s;t undaunted of antient Wor|thies, who had a &s;ufficient portion of heroic philanthropy to prefer the bene|fit of mankind to every &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ider|ation,
<PB N="59" REF="61">
had yet his hours of diffidence and de&s;pondency. On a final review of his own generous labours, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have que&s;tioned the very exi&s;tence of Virtue, though he had made it the idol of his life; a &s;triking proof, that the temperate and invariable energy of &s;oul, which alone perhaps de&s;erves the name of true Courage, can only proceed from a fuller knowledge and love of GOD; from the animating a&s;&s;urance, that, how|ever we may pro&s;per or fail in the earthly &s;ucce&s;s of our endeavours to do good, the merit of the attempt is regi&s;tered in Heaven; and we &s;ecure to our&s;elves the everla&s;ting approbation of our Almighty Parent, in proportion as we approach towards that ble&s;&s;ed model of Perfect Benevolence, who has taught us, by his divine example, to compa&s;&s;ionate and to
<PB N="60" REF="62">
relieve the &s;ufferings of the wretched. From this &s;ource flowed the courageous beneficence of HOWARD: and how de|lightful it is to ob&s;erve that the force, the extent, the utility, and the lu&s;tre of the &s;tream, has gloriou&s;ly corre&s;ponded to the height and purity of the fountain!</P>
<P>The Sen&s;uali&s;t and the Sceptic may, indeed, deride the conduct of a man, who &s;acrificed all the common plea&s;ures of life, and &s;ought for no recompence but in the favour of Heaven. It may be &s;aid that an illu&s;ive fervor of mind has hurried men, in all periods of the world, into &s;ingular and wild exertions, which excite the wonder of the pa&s;&s;ing hour, and are afterwards either de&s;erved|ly forgotten, or only recalled to notice by Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, to caution the re&s;tle&s;s and impetuous &s;pirit of man again&s;t all &s;imilar exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">But the pur&s;uits of HOWARD, though they had all that &s;ublime energy which &s;o often di&s;tingui&s;hed the projects of Super&s;tition, were &s;o far from being influenced by any &s;uper&s;titious propen|&s;ity, that perhaps they cannot appear to more advantage than by being brought into compari&s;on, or contra&s;t, not with the &s;luggi&s;h piety of &s;eque&s;tered Monks, but with the bold and &s;plendid feats of the molt active and enterpri&s;ing Fanatici&s;m. Allow me, therefore, to recall to your thoughts tho&s;e di&s;tant ages, when every ardent &s;pirit in Chri&s;tendom was inflamed with a pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire to de|liver the Chri&s;tian pilgrims of Pale&s;tine from the oppre&s;&s;ion of Infidels! Figure to your&s;elves the whole force of Europe collecting its violence, like a troubled &s;ea, and preparing to pour a terrific and
<PB N="62" REF="64">
de&s;tructive inundation over the Holy Land! Behold the &s;trong and the weak, the ambitious and the humble, pur&s;uing the &s;ame object! Behold a&s;&s;embled Kings and their People, Soldiers and Prie&s;ts, the &s;ervants of Earth and Heaven ru&s;hing, with equal ardour, to re&s;cue the Sepulchre of CHRIST, and to drown all the innumerable enemies of their Faith in an univer&s;al deluge of blood! In this &s;cene we have the &s;ublime&s;t &s;pecta|cle, perhaps, that was ever exhibited by mi&s;taken piety and mi&s;guided valour. The love of GOD, by which this heroic multitude was profe&s;&s;edly impelled, was probably in many minds as &s;incere as it was ardent. The religious &s;pirit of their enterprize can &s;till animate and tran&s;port us in the &s;ong of the Poet: and in the more rational page of Hi&s;tory, while we
<PB N="63" REF="65">
ju&s;tly lament the errors of their devotion, we admire the force and per&s;everance of their courage.</P>
<P>To the &s;ublime fortitude of the&s;e collected warriors, let us compare the mild magnanimity of HOWARD. Let us &s;urvey him &s;etting forth for an expedi|tion as perilous as theirs; not as the Soldier of Fanatici&s;m, but as the Pilgrim of Humanity! Attachment to GOD, and re&s;olution which no hard&s;hip, no danger, no difficulty can daunt, are equally con|&s;picuous in the &s;anguinary Fanatic and the compa&s;&s;ionate Philanthropi&s;t: but how widely different are the prime earthly ob|jects of their pur&s;uits! The fierce Cru&s;aders invaded A&s;ia with a de&s;ire to exterminate the Infidels. The benevolent HOWARD was led into the &s;ame quarter of the globe, and into perils more deadly than tho&s;e of
<PB N="64" REF="66">
war, by a wi&s;h to exterminate, or rather to re&s;train, the ravages of that terrific enemy to human life, the Plague.</P>
<P>He had conceived an idea, that, as this mo&s;t alarming of mortal maladies has been often &s;trangely neglected by the &s;luggi&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious inhabitants of the Ea&s;t, it might be po&s;&s;ible by a calm and courageous examination of its na|ture and its progre&s;s, to &s;et limits to its rage; and particularly to &s;ecure his own country from a future vi&s;itation of a ca|lamity, again&s;t which the fearle&s;s and eager &s;pirit of Commerce appears not to have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ufficient precaution. For the pro&s;pect of accompli&s;hing pub|lic good, &s;o devoutly to be wi&s;hed, he nobly thought it a trifling &s;acrifice to hazard the little remnant of his advanced life; and, however men or nations may
<PB N="65" REF="67">
differ in policy or religion, wherever there is a human &s;pirit &s;ufficiently pure and enlightened to e&s;timate public virtue, the &s;entiments and the conduct of HOW|ARD mu&s;t &s;ecure to his memory the fonde&s;t veneration. There is a perfection and felicity in his character that appears &s;upremely laudable in every point of view. If, ab&s;tracted from all religious con&s;iderations, we regard him only as a citizen who devoted him&s;elf to the &s;er|vice of his country, the brighte&s;t records of Antiquity afford us no parallel to his merit. Had he lived in tho&s;e early times, the generous enthu&s;ia&s;m of the antient world would have idolized his name. Philo&s;ophy and Genius would have found, in his benevolent labours, the mo&s;t am|ple theme for in&s;truction, and the pure&s;t &s;ubject for univer&s;al pahegyrick. They
<PB N="66" REF="68">
would have celebrated him as a bene|factor to mankind, who had built a new portico to the Temple of Glory &s;upe|rior to the dome it&s;elf, They would have preferred the beneficent Philan|thropi&s;t to the dazzling Conqueror, to the fa&s;cinating Demagogue, to the at|tractive Sophi&s;t; and all the various idols of public prai&s;e. But as Anti|quity exhibits no character of &s;uch un|clouded lu&s;tre, we have great rea&s;on to conclude, that &s;uch a character could owe its exi&s;tence only to the pure and &s;ublime &s;pirit of our Chri&s;tian Faith. Let us, therefore, contemplate HOWARD as a Chri&s;tian! it is by con&s;idering him in this light, that we &s;hall feel our&s;elves mo&s;t happily related to his virtues, and mo&s;t delightfully intere&s;ted in the ho|nours they receive.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">In the poor and calamitous objects of his regard, in the gentlene&s;s and pu|rity of his manners, in his mode&s;t and magnanimous refu&s;al of earthly honours, in the wide extent and courageous per|&s;everance of his charity, we cannot fail to di&s;cern how richly he was endowed with the genuine &s;pirit of that pure and &s;ublime Religion which has the divine prerogative of converting weakne&s;s into &s;trength, and of giving to Humility the influence of Power. There is not a fea|ture in the character, there is hardly an action in the life of this exemplary per|&s;onage, that does not mark him as a true &s;ervant of CHRIST. And may we not pre&s;ume the ble&s;&s;ed Author of our faith, in &s;upplying us in the&s;e di&s;&s;olute times with a recent example of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing and unlimited beneficence, is graciou&s;ly
<PB N="68" REF="70">
plea&s;ed to afford us a new motive to prize and to cheri&s;h that animating faith, which could form, in an age like the pre&s;ent, a character &s;o wonderfully entitled to the veneration of the world? The &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity is &s;o vi&s;ible in the conduct of HOWARD, that the prime objects of his attention might be thought to have been &s;ugge&s;ted to him by the very words in which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord announces to the heirs of eternal glory the &s;ource of their beatitude&mdash;"Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the king|dom prepared for you from the founda|tion of the world; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink; I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me; I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me."</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71">Is it po&s;&s;ible for us, my Brethren, to recall to our memory the&s;e holy words without feeling at the &s;ame time, in the mo&s;t forcible degree, all the Chri&s;tian merits of HOWARD? Can we fail to admire and to venerate the unex|ampled ardour, purity, and per&s;everance, with which he exerci&s;ed the peculiar virtue &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by our Lord?&mdash; While we behold him &s;ublimely pre-eminent in this Chri&s;tian perfection, &s;hall we not cheri&s;h the delightful idea, that his heavenly rewards will be finally ade|quate to his unrivaled labours on earth? Shall not tho&s;e who have loved him ex|ult in the per&s;ua&s;ion, that in that great and aweful day, when the living and the dead are to receive their everla&s;ting doom; when the princes and the great ones of the earth may be confronted
<PB N="70" REF="72">
with tho&s;e whom they have per&s;ecuted and oppre&s;&s;ed, or whom they have failed to relieve; when the proude&s;t Sons of Learning, Genius, or Wit, may &s;hrink at the &s;uperior lu&s;tre of tho&s;e whom they have ridiculed and reviled; HOWARD will &s;hine encircled by thou&s;ands, who will gratefully plead for his beatitude in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed words of our Redeemer, "I was in pri&s;on, and he came unto me!"</P>
<P>Yes, my Brethren, the day will a&s;|&s;uredly come, when the &s;ervant &s;o &s;ig|nally faithful will be called to a reward, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t reach of our con|ception, by the voice of his Righteous Ma&s;ter&mdash;then, and then only, will prai&s;e be fully proportioned to his tran&s;cendant merit; when this con&s;ummate Chri&s;tian is rai&s;ed to glory by the glorified Me&s;|&s;iah, when his pure &s;pirit exults in the commendation of his GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">The imperfect efforts, that man|kind may make to do honour to &s;uch a Being, cannot, indeed, &s;o much promote his glory, as they may conduce to the intere&s;t of human nature. Subject as it has been to the wilde&s;t exce&s;&s;es, human panegyric, in all its &s;hapes, may be &s;afe|ly devoted to a per&s;onage, whom it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to prai&s;e with &s;incerity, without feeling our di&s;po&s;ition improved. In a beneficent, a &s;ublime, and truly reli|gious character, there is a &s;ort of mag|netic virtue, which to tho&s;e who are af|fectionately drawn towards it, though only in idea, communicates a portion of it&s;elf. Hence ari&s;es, what we cannot too fondly cheri&s;h, the delight and the uti|lity of commemorating departed worth.

<P><PB N="74" REF="76">IN the moment that this benevolent Divine concluded his addre&s;s to his at|tentive brethren, my kind and vigilant Guides removed me from the temple.&mdash; I was now led into a &s;cene entirely dif|ferent from tho&s;e we left. It was an open and verdant plain, with a few ele|vations in the ground, that afforded ad|vantageous views of the whole exten&s;ive &s;pot. Here, in&s;tead of beholding the Mini&s;ters of Peace, I found my&s;elf en|circled by the multitudinous votaries of War. It appeared to me that all the military and all the naval &s;ervants of our country were collected together, and each different divi&s;ion of the&s;e well-ap|pointed and well-looking men, that formed a plea&s;ing &s;pectacle alone, was
<PB N="75" REF="77">
attended by a crowd of mi&s;cellaneous &s;pectators, more numerous than it&s;elf: yet in all this immen&s;e multitude there was no &s;ign of tumult or confu&s;ion. They were ranged in &s;uch a manner as to form a wide circular area in the mid&s;t of them. I was &s;tationed on a little eminence within this area; and in the &s;ame vacant &s;pace I beheld a party of veteran Commanders, both Military and Naval, who &s;eemed to have been conferring together, but &s;eparated by the direction of my aetherial Conductors, to addre&s;s, in different parts of this ex|ten&s;ive field, the different companies a&s;|&s;igned to their care. What they re|&s;pectively &s;aid in their &s;eparate depart|ments I was unable to di&s;cover, as I only heard di&s;tinctly one gallant Veteran, who&s;e character was particularly dear to
<PB N="76" REF="78">
me. This con&s;ummate officer has rai&s;ed him&s;elf by merit alone from the hum|ble&s;t rank of military life to a &s;tation of the highe&s;t honour and tru&s;t. His mo|de&s;ty is as &s;ingular as his fortune: pa&s;&s;ing clo&s;e to me, with a gracious &s;alutation, he approached a very fine orderly corps of foot, who looked up to him with a &s;ort of filial re&s;pect, while he &s;poke to them the few following words:</P>
<P>"As bravery and compa&s;&s;ion are the characteri&s;tics of good Soldiers, you cannot want, my friends, any long ex|hortation from me to honour the me|mory of HOWARD; the mo&s;t re&s;olute and the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate man that has lived in our time. Though he was not of our profe&s;&s;ion, as his life was de|voted to mitigate the united horrors of
<PB N="77" REF="79">
captivity and &s;ickne&s;s, tho&s;e wor&s;t of ene|mies to the &s;pirit of a &s;oldier, you will undoubtedly feel that he has a peculiar claim to our mo&s;t grateful and generous regard."</P>
<P>This &s;peech was followed by a bur&s;t of acclamation from tho&s;e to whom it was particularly addre&s;&s;ed. Similar &s;houts of applau&s;e re&s;ounded from dif|ferent quarters of the &s;pacious field, while our aetherial attendants, Gratitude and Admiration, who followed each &s;peaker at the clo&s;e of each addre&s;s to different divi&s;ions of this innumerable a&s;&s;embly, di&s;played, to each divi&s;ion in its turn, an exten&s;ive &s;ketch of a &s;imple but magnificent mau&s;oleum to the me|mory of HOWARD, in the form of an Engli&s;h lazaretto. On the fir&s;t di&s;play
<PB N="78" REF="80">
of this &s;triking and worthy monument, the applauding multitude &s;eemed to ex|ult in the pro&s;pect of its completion. But I &s;oon ob&s;erved, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, that while Gratitude and Admi|ration were bu&s;y in exciting the various ranks of the va&s;t a&s;&s;embly, to accom|pli&s;h this favourite de&s;ign, they were fol|lowed by two earthy fiends of a dark and malignant influence: the&s;e were De|traction and Indifference, who &s;hed &s;uch a chill and depre&s;&s;ive mi&s;t around them, that all the ardour of the A&s;&s;embly &s;eemed to &s;ink. Among the mi&s;cella|neous crowds that were vi&s;ible between the divi&s;ions of the martial ho&s;t, there ran a murmur of obloquy and deri&s;ion again&s;t the pure object of public ve|neration. He was reviled as a whim&s;ical Reformer, and a ra&s;h Enthu&s;ia&s;t, who
<PB N="79" REF="81">
had ab&s;urdly &s;acrificed his life in a vain and fanta&s;tic pur&s;uit. This ba&s;e &s;pirit of calumnious malignity was not com|municated to any one divi&s;ion of the martial multitude; but the univer&s;al zeal for the glory of HOWARD &s;eemed to be almo&s;t annihilated; even Gratitude and Admiration appeared to grow faint in their darling purpo&s;e. During their lan|guor, they &s;uffered their &s;ketch of the Mau&s;oleum to be gradually &s;tolen from their hands, and to drop upon the ground. At this moment a &s;udden and violent earthquake was felt through all the ex|ten&s;ive &s;cene. The centre of the vacant area opened&mdash;it threw forth a phantom terrific and enormous&mdash;its magnitude &s;eemed to grow upon the &s;ight; its li|neaments were &s;hrouded from our view by an immen&s;e mantle, on which were
<PB N="80" REF="82">
repre&s;ented a thou&s;and different and hi|deous images of Death. Its name was Contagion&mdash;it ru&s;hed forward with an inde&s;cribable movement. Di&s;may and confu&s;ion overwhelmed all that quarter of the crowded &s;cene, that was particu|larly threatened by its fir&s;t advance. The affrighted multitude rolled back like a tumultuous &s;ea. The horrid &s;pectre &s;topt; and left a wide interval between it&s;elf and the retiring ho&s;t. A ray of heavenly light illumined the vacant &s;pace. I fixed my eye on the brilliant &s;pot, and &s;oon beheld the meek and gentle form of HOWARD advancing, without fear or arrogance, towards the terrific Phantom. With an untrembling hand he &s;eized the dark folds of its ex|ten&s;ive mantle, and &s;eemed animated with the hope of annihilating the Mon|&s;ter.
<PB N="81" REF="83">
In the in&s;tant, a bur&s;t of cele&s;tial &s;plendor was &s;pread over the gloomy plain. The Angel of Retribution de|&s;cended; and &s;natching the con&s;ummate Philanthropi&s;t to his bo&s;om, he ro&s;e again; while all the a&s;toni&s;hed multi|tude, now reviving from their terror, gazed only on the cele&s;tial apparition; and heard the rea&s;cending Seraph thus addre&s;s the beneficent &s;pirit now com|mitted to his care:</P>

<P>As &s;oon as the divine me&s;&s;enger had cea&s;ed to &s;peak, every voice in the re|animated multitude, that heard him,

<P>This little work is made public, not from a vain expectation, or de&s;ire, in the Writer to obtain any degree of literary di&s;tinction; for, if his wi&s;hes and en|deavours are &s;ucce&s;sful, the world will not know from what hand it proceeds.</P>

various mortals, now trying to com|memorate thy merit, thou &s;ee&s;t that I am influenced by no arrogant conceit of having prai&s;ed with peculiar felicity the perfections that I &s;o ardently admire.

<P>The chief aim of the&s;e few and ha&s;ty pages is to recall, at this particular time, to the liberal &s;pirits of our countrymen that generous ardour with which they

embraced the fir&s;t idea of a public mo|nument to HOWARD. While the ex|pence and dignity of that monument are yet un&s;ettled, a Writer may con&s;ider him&s;elf as a friend to national honour, who endeavours to animate his country to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive di&s;play of her mu|nificence, and her gratitude towards the pure&s;t public virtue. May the ju&s;tly remember, that, to te&s;tify a fond mater|nal pride in &s;uch a departed &s;on, to manife&s;t and perpetuate e&s;teem for &s;uch a character, is, in truth, to promote the intere&s;t of genuine Patrioti&s;m, of &s;ublime Morality, and of perfect Religion!</P>
