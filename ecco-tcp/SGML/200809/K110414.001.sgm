<HEAD>TO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, <HI>PATRONS</HI> OF <HI>ENTERTAINING LITERATURE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE great encouragement and &s;upport our Plan of a <HI>LITERARY MUSEUM,</HI> or <HI>NOVEL REPOSITORY,</HI> has received from a generous public, demands the utmo&s;t tribute of gratitude; and it is with plea&s;ure announced, that &s;ince its commencement Manu&s;cripts have been intro|duced receiving general approbation. The manner in which we have printed Works committed to our care will better &s;peak our attention and prai&s;e than any eu|logium of language.</P>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, from this &s;pecimen of our con|duct, will be &s;ure to have the efforts of their genius and productions of their pen introduced to the world in a &s;tyle of &s;uperiority: the printing will be executed with expedition, correctne&s;s, accuracy and elegance, and the paper equally corre&s;pondent; and we pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert that no pains, care, a&s;&s;iduity, or expence, &s;hall be &s;pared to merit the continuance of the approbation we have ob|tained; and we al&s;o affirm, that we have never intro|duced

any &s;ubjects but &s;uch as are founded on the ba&s;is of Virtue, and have tended to improve the under&s;tanding and to amend the heart.&mdash;Our &s;tudy &s;hall be to plea&s;e; as this will equally add to our intere&s;t as reflect to our honor.</P>
<P>In addition to this propo&s;al, Authors who wi&s;h to derive emolument from their &s;tudies, are informed, that five hundred pounds is placed at an eminent bankers, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing literary productions; and notwith&s;tanding we are now unrivalled in the public e&s;timation, for Novels, Tales, Romances, Adventures, &amp;c. yet, in this undertaking, works of a general na|ture, whether Originals, Tran&s;lations, or Compilations, which can entertain or improve the mind, elucidate the &s;ciences, or be of any utility, will here find an a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>From the great encrea&s;e and general encouragement <HI>CIRCULATING LIBRARIES</HI> have received, and which are now e&s;tabli&s;hed in all parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, (an employ both re&s;pectable and lucrative,) &s;uch as are de&s;irous of embarking in that line of bu&s;ine&s;s are informed that books &s;uitable for that purpo&s;e are kept ready bound, in Hi&s;tory, Voyages, Novels, Plays, &amp;c. containing from One Hundred to Five Thou&s;and Volumes, which may he had at a few days notice, with a catalogue for their &s;ub&s;cribers, and in&s;tructions and directions how to plan, &s;y&s;temize, and conduct the &s;ame.</P>

<P>AFTER a dreadful interval of four di&s;mal weeks, I am once more enabled to re&s;ume my pen. Your friendly letter of condolence reached me la&s;t night. How &s;oothing, my Sophia, is the balm of &s;ympathy to a mind wounded by af|fliction. Your kind expre&s;&s;ions made me di&s;&s;olve into tears; but they were tears of &s;oftne&s;s and relief, far different from tho&s;e of bitterne&s;s and de&s;pair, of which lately I have &s;hed &s;o many.</P>
<P>I admit of all you &s;ay, my dear; but rea&s;oning, however &s;olid and convincing, rarely makes any impre&s;&s;ion in the fir&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="6">
&s;tages of immoderate &s;orrow, and I ac|knowledge the ju&s;tice without feeling the force of the con&s;olation you would in&s;pire. I know we have enjoyed our beloved parent to a more advanced pe|riod than, from his feeble con&s;titution and emaciated frame, we had cau&s;e to hope, and that we ought not now to repine that it has plea&s;ed the Almighty to take him from us; &s;ince every year of the la&s;t three of his life, has appeared in the light of a lea&s;e from heaven hardly to be expected, and at certain &s;ea&s;ons, almo&s;t hardly to be wi&s;hed; but for &s;ome months previous to his death, he had been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch unu&s;ual good health, that all our former fears were lulled into fatal &s;ecurity, and I cheri&s;hed with delight the plea&s;ing idea of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing him even in old age, and of de|voting my days to render the remainder of his life comfortable and happy.</P>
<P>I do not however give uncontrouled
<PB N="3" REF="7">
&s;cope to my grief, as you tell me you are convinced is the ca&s;e: I do not complain that the &s;udden &s;hock of this &s;ad &s;troke made it perhaps overpower us with redoubled violence; on the con|trary, I ble&s;s heaven that the &s;ufferings were <HI>ours</HI> not my dear father's, and that his tran&s;ition to a better world &s;eemed to all appearance unattended by tho&s;e painful &s;truggles and agonies which in general render the awful clo&s;e of life &s;till more dreadful, both to tho&s;e who endure and to tho&s;e who behold it.</P>
<P>Oh my beloved friend! it is not his lo&s;s (though God only knows how &s;e|vere) that lies with &s;uch a weight of mi|&s;ery on our minds: ah no, Sophia; to the inevitable &s;troke of death our deare&s;t intere&s;ts remain every in&s;tant ex|po&s;ed; and dreadful as is the blow, re|&s;ignation, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by time, e&s;pecially in the &s;anguine &s;ea&s;on of youth, &s;eldom I be|lieve fails in re&s;toring tranquillity. Long
<PB N="4" REF="8">
and deeply mu&s;t we have mourned our irreparable misfortune: yet I know I am not formed different from the re&s;t of mankind, and what millions are doomed to endure, I am con&s;cious I might have been enabled to &s;upport; but our di&s;|tre&s;&s;es are accumulated, and beyond mea&s;ure &s;evere: not merely have we been deprived of a parent tender and revered, but to this calamity, of it&s;elf almo&s;t &s;uf|ficient to overpower human nature, is &s;uperadded the agonizing aggravation of knowing that his be&s;t days have been overclouded by &s;ecret and acute &s;uffer|ings &mdash;&s;ufferings which have corroded his mind, undermined his con&s;titution, and to which he has at length yielded him&s;elf a prey; yes, my Sophia, that ever honoured parent, whom we reve|renced with enthu&s;ia&s;tic affection, was a victim to remor&s;e, and died of that mo&s;t painful of all di&s;tempers&mdash;that di&s;|temper which admits of no cure, and
<PB N="5" REF="9">
bids defiance to human &s;kill&mdash;a broken heart.</P>
<P>His death, ever to be lamented, has brought to light a fatal, fatal &s;tory; but I &s;hall endeavour to enter upon it with what compo&s;ure I can &s;ummon to my aid; and from the &s;oothing relief of con|fidential communication, perhaps my &s;orrows may derive &s;ome alleviation.</P>
<P>After being &s;eized with the fit which proved, in its con&s;equences, &s;o dreadful, a &s;hort interval of ea&s;e &s;ucceeded, which my &s;i&s;ter and I, unu&s;ed to &s;cenes of this alarming nature, vainly regarded as the certain &s;ymptom of recovery; but my father, who felt him&s;elf inwardly gone, perceived with pain our delu&s;ive error. My dear girls, &s;aid he, in a voice, ah! how exhau&s;ted! you mu&s;t endeavour to recon|cile your&s;elves to the &s;hock which awaits you: the will of heaven mu&s;t not only be obeyed, in that we have neither choice nor merit, but it mu&s;t be obeyed
<PB N="6" REF="10">
with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and without a murmur. The Almighty is about to deprive you, as you mu&s;t at pre&s;ent imagine, of your only &s;urviving parent; but know, ano|ther yet remains, who, I tru&s;t, will be pre|vailed with, after I am gone, to &s;upply the place and fulfil the duties of a father.</P>
<P>To this &s;olemn addre&s;s, which &s;eemed to annihilate my &s;en&s;es, I was unable to reply; but Fanny's feelings found vent in tears. She bur&s;t into an agony of grief&mdash;oh deare&s;t papa, cried &s;he, who upon earth can to us &s;upply your place? when you leave us, we &s;hall be alone in the world; no one cares for us, no one loves us, we have no friend but you.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of heaven compo&s;e your|&s;elves, my deare&s;t children, replied my father. I leave you neither unprotected nor unfriended; and &s;evere as is the fir&s;t early &s;troke to youthful and &s;u&s;ceptible hearts, a little time I hope will abate the poignancy of your regret; but the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="7" REF="11">
moments, added he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, are un&s;peakably precious. Let Howard be &s;ent for in all ha&s;te; tell him to make all the expedition in his power, and inform him that I expect, from his faithful attachment, the mo&s;t painful, though mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary offices of friend|&s;hip &mdash;that he will clo&s;e my eyes and re|ceive my la&s;t injunctions. A me&s;&s;enger was in&s;tantly di&s;patched. Mr. Howard was at Clarance, whither he had gone but the evening before, having left my father in perfect health. He travelled with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te; yet the few hours that elap&s;ed before he appeared, to us &s;eemed an age. My father, though the dreadful &s;ymptoms of approaching di&s;&s;olution rapidly encrea&s;ed, &s;till retained his &s;en&s;es unimpaired; and on being in|formed that his friend was in the hou&s;e, he expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude to heaven that he had not breathed his la&s;t &s;igh without &s;eeing him, and de&s;ired that he might
<PB N="8" REF="12">
be in&s;tantly introduced into his bed chamber.</P>
<P>On his entrance, Mr. Howard found my &s;i&s;ter, whom no entreaties could per|&s;uade to leave the room, vainly &s;triving to &s;uppre&s;s &s;obs, which the apprehen&s;ion of too violently affecting our dying pa|rent obliged her to endeavour, though ineffectually, to re&s;train. My feelings, alas! were &s;uch as admitted not of the relief of tears; the &s;tupor of de&s;pair had benumbed every faculty. I was alive only to the &s;en&s;ations of mi&s;ery; and con|cealed by the curtains, I kneeled at the &s;ide of the bed, offering up &s;ilent peti|tions for that recovery, of which I had now lo&s;t the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope. My father, after expre&s;&s;ing his &s;atisfaction on &s;eeing Mr. Howard, de&s;ired the phy|&s;ician, and all, excepting that worthy friend, my &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf, &s;hould leave the room. This reque&s;t being in&s;tantly complied with, he be&s;ought Mr. How|ard
<PB N="9" REF="13">
to open a bureau which &s;tood in the chamber: you will there find a manu|&s;cript, &s;aid he, dated &s;ome years ago, and written by my own hand: this ma|nu&s;cript, my dear girls, (addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to us) contains a horrid tale, which I could wi&s;h were for ever buried with me in the grave; but as it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary that your real &s;ituation in life &s;hould be made known to you at my death, when, expo&s;ed to the dangers and difficulties of a world with which you are totally unacquainted, the protection of your relations mu&s;t be peculiarly important, I have con&s;idered it as a duty incumbent on me, to leave behind an impartial re|lation of that &s;eries of misfortunes, that checquered train of evils, which have rendered me an alien from my family, an exile from my country, and have long bani&s;hed comfort and tranquillity from my bo&s;om. So oppre&s;&s;ed was his arti|culation, and &s;o feeble his voice, that our
<PB N="10" REF="14">
dear father did not fini&s;h the &s;peech without many interruptions from weak|ne&s;s and fatigue, and the la&s;t words half died upon his lips; but having a little recovered him&s;elf&mdash;you, my dear friend, &s;aid he to Mr. Howard, will I hope af|ford my girls con&s;olation and &s;upport un|der the pain of this &s;evere and unex|pected communication. To your care I bequeath them. See them &s;afe under the protection of Ben&s;ley or my father; repre&s;ent to them, when they are able to li&s;ten to comfort, that my penitence has been almo&s;t proportioned to my crimes; and ah, my dear Howard! if po&s;&s;ible de|te&s;t not the mi&s;erable author of calami|ties, the guilt of which, fifteen long years of remor&s;e have, I tru&s;t, obliterated from the records of heaven.</P>
<P>Sophia, what were at that moment my &s;en&s;ations? Is it in language to ex|pre&s;s them? Ah no! they were incon|ceivable and unutterable! I felt there
<PB N="11" REF="15">
was yet an agony &s;uperior to that of lo&s;|ing all that is deare&s;t to us on earth; and while di&s;traction drew an exclama|tion of de&s;pair from my &s;i&s;ter, horror benumbed my &s;en&s;es; and I &s;unk life|le&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>When my recollection was re&s;tored, I found my&s;elf in bed in my own apart|ment. The tran&s;ports of Fanny's grief, and the gloomy &s;ilence of Th&ecirc;r&ecirc;&s;e, and the phy&s;ician who attended me, too evi|dently told that all was over with my dear father. Exhau&s;ted with the exer|tion of &s;peaking, he had breathed his la&s;t &s;igh almo&s;t in the in&s;tant that I was carried out of his chamber.</P>
<P>You, my Sophia, who are happily ble&s;&s;ed with beloved and indulgent pa|rents, may be perhaps enabled to form &s;ome idea adequate to the di&s;traction a lo&s;s like ours mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned: yet, yet, my dear, this was not all; an aw|ful ob&s;curity &s;eemed to envelope &s;ome
<PB N="12" REF="16">
hidden &s;ource of unknown and additional mi&s;ery. We were filled with horror in|conceivable. To part with our deare&s;t father at that in&s;tant, &s;eemed an evil in|ferior to knowing he had lived with a load of angui&s;h on his con&s;cience; and anxiou&s;ly as we wi&s;hed, we yet dreaded ten thou&s;and times more to have the fearful my&s;tery explained.</P>
<P>After a night of acute di&s;tre&s;s, &s;leep kindly came to our relief, and buried us for about an hour in a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate of forgetfulne&s;s; yet even in &s;lumber, a melancholy gloom pervaded our repo&s;e, and we awoke only &s;ufficiently recruited to be able to weep.</P>
<P>We were then vi&s;ited by Mr. Howard, who &s;ympathized in our &s;ufferings with a degree of feeling that mu&s;t for ever endear him to our hearts. Ah, Mr. How|ard! cried I, the moment I could arti|culate for my tears&mdash;where, where are tho&s;e fatal papers of my dear, dear fa|ther's,
<PB N="13" REF="17">
which have been intru&s;ted to your care? have you your&s;elf peru&s;ed them? Tell me, for heaven's &s;ake! are the contents too horrible&mdash;are they &s;uch as we &s;hall be able to read and not expo&s;e.</P>
<P>I will not attempt to conceal from you, &s;aid he, with the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, though not without he&s;itation, that they are of &s;uch a nature as mu&s;t both hurt and affect you; yet there are mingled in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing narrative, &s;o many al|leviating circum&s;tances to &s;often cen&s;ure and &s;ilence condemnation, that I hope the communication will &s;hock neither of you too &s;everely, when you are in a &s;i|tuation to receive the information with more compo&s;ure than it can be &s;uppo&s;ed you at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh! cried Fanny, can any thing aug|ment our pre&s;ent mi&s;ery? or if that were indeed po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t not &s;u&s;pence more effectually add to it than any intelligence we can now receive? I was in hopes of
<PB N="14" REF="18">
having time granted me, &s;aid he, to &s;of|ten the communication by degrees; but &s;ince you are &s;o violently alarmed, I be|lieve any certainty is almo&s;t preferable to your pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence. I &s;hall therefore bring you the packet; I only entreat that you will allow me, before you open it, the favour of one half hour's conver&s;ation, that I may be &s;atis|fied I do not commit too great an im|prudence in venturing to intru&s;t you with it.</P>
<P>This worthy man then began to hint at its contents; but in &s;pite of all his en|deavours to palliate and &s;often the &s;ad recital, the &s;hock entirely overpowered us; yet I in&s;i&s;ted on knowing all; and breathle&s;s with terror, received the dread|ful manu&s;cript from his hands.</P>
<P>Let me make but one ob&s;ervation, cried he, on delivering it: the years of &s;elf reproach and angui&s;h, which &s;uc|ceeded to your father's errors, &s;o pathe|tically
<PB N="15" REF="19">
de&s;cribed by him&s;elf, more than atone for his faults. This penitence, his deep felt &s;en&s;e of every breach of duty, and the unerring rectitude of his mind and conduct the in&s;tant he was awakened from the delirium of pa&s;&s;ion, even con|vince me there was inherent in his bo&s;om, a &s;ecret &s;entiment of &s;uperior virtue, which, however ob&s;cured and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the force of mi&s;guided feelings and the violence of temptation, required but the moment of remor&s;e to expand and once more fully regain its influence over his actions.</P>
<P>What mi&s;ery my &s;i&s;ter and I endured from the melancholy narration, and the tears we &s;hed over it, you, my Sophia, when you have peru&s;ed the packet tran|&s;cribed by Mr. Howard, which accom|panies this, may be almo&s;t enabled to conceive: a tedious and &s;evere illne&s;s, from which I am &s;till but feebly reco|vered,
<PB N="16" REF="20">
was the natural and inevitable con&s;equence of &s;uch a conflict of emotions.</P>
<P>It is not, I own, without a &s;en&s;ation of repugnance, that I prevail with my&s;elf to &s;end you this di&s;mal tale; but alas! &s;o public has been every circum&s;tance of my father's misfortunes (tho&s;e which greatly extenuate his errors excepted) that I have rea&s;on to believe even you, my dear, have often heard of the mi&s;e|rable fate of Lord Linro&s;e, as a remark|able event that took place in a family of di&s;tinction, and made much noi&s;e in the world &s;ome time previous to your birth; but that my father was the unhappy &s;ource or &s;uch a train of calamities, oh! who could have conceived po&s;&s;ible!&mdash; that a&s;toni&s;hing fact never, never could you have divined.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider this confidence, therefore, as a ju&s;tification of his memory; and though the &s;ad relation it&s;elf is a &s;acred tru&s;t to be repo&s;ed only in the faithful
<PB N="17" REF="21">
bo&s;om of friend&s;hip, would to heaven all the world were as well acquainted with his remor&s;e as with his faults; and that the knowledge of his &s;ufferings could wholly obliterate the recollection of his errors. Adieu, my deare&s;t friend.</P>

<P>WHEN this packet is delivered to my dear girls, I &s;hall not have, to blu&s;h for its contents: I &s;hall be then no more: and as it is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite that they &s;hould one day be made acquainted with their real &s;ituation in life, I have for two rea&s;ons preferred that awful period for this painful communication: in the fir&s;t place, the information I am about to di&s;|clo&s;e, is attended with circum&s;tances of a

<P>Be not overwhelmed with horror, my beloved children, on peru&s;ing the&s;e words:&mdash;words, of an import &s;o dreadful, and which you never could have con|ceived connected with your father's name.

This, and many other particu|lars, which perhaps may have at times proved matter both of &s;urprize and con|cern, I mean here fully to explain; and in particular that que&s;tion will at length receive a &s;atisfactory reply, which has been hitherto productive only of vague, eva&s;ive, and embarra&s;&s;ed an&s;wers, viz.&mdash; how I, an Engli&s;hman, apparently at|tached to my own nation, and partial to its cu&s;toms, &s;hould have voluntarily ex|iled my&s;elf from my country, and &s;eclud|ing

who was violent in prejudice and rigid in principle, allowed us few indulgen|cies; and had made choice of our pre|ceptor rather for the integrity of his heart, than on account of the &s;uperior abilities of his mind, which had been narrowed by the retirement of life, and total ignorance of the world: but my Lord, who&s;e knowledge of men and manners had not rendered <HI>his</HI> notions le&s;s contracted, imagined we could no where &s;o effectually imbibe the fir&s;t &s;entiments of virtue, as under the tuition of a man, who&s;e purity was &s;uch, that he &s;eemed to know little difference be|tween an error and a crime. The &s;y&s;tem by which we were educated, was of cour&s;e &s;trict in the extreme; but the au&s;tere principles that had been early im|planted in our minds, our companions at College found it no difficult matter to extirpate; and a &s;light acquaintance with &s;ociety, &s;oon convinced us, that
<PB N="22" REF="26">
we were incapable of adhering to habits, ab&s;urb in them&s;elves, and of no a&s;&s;i&s;|tance either to religion or morality. Having once deviated from prejudices, however weak, which the mind has been accu&s;tomed to regard as &s;acred, to &s;top exactly at the proper limits of rectitude requires a portion of &s;teady fortitude even &s;uperior to that which pre&s;erves us firm in our fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; the reformation is indeed but too often followed by a total revolution of principle, and even virtue her&s;elf is not unfrequently overturned under the appellation of <HI>confined ideas.</HI>&mdash; Such, at lea&s;t, was in part the change my mind underwent after having re&s;ided &s;ome time at the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>When the part of my education to be there attained was completed, I &s;et out on my travels; and immediately after my return from the Continent, that bu&s;y period of my life commenced, the bitter recollection of which almo&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="27">
incapacitates me from relating the many painful occurrences it produced.</P>
<P>My brother had cho&s;en a military life, and we had not met during three years which I &s;pent abroad. We kept up a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence however; and he was with his regiment in Ireland at the time of my arrival in England. I received a letter from him &s;oon after, intimating his having lately married a young lady, of whom he &s;eemed pa&s;&s;io|nately enamoured, but who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s any of tho&s;e advantages, either of family or fortune, likely to reconcile my father to a &s;tep in which he had not been con&s;ulted. Con&s;cious how tena|cious my Lord ever had been of his au|thority, added to an invincible prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, which he had long entertained again&s;t the Iri&s;h nation, my brother, in the height of his nuptial felicity, could not avoid &s;uffering the &s;evere&s;t apprehen&s;ions for the con&s;equences of
<PB N="24" REF="28">
his imprudence; and be&s;ought me to exert all my influence with my father, to &s;often his wrath at this unexpected intelligence.</P>
<P>My endeavours, however, were on this head ineffectual; my Lord was overwhelmed with a rage that did not evaporate with its violence, but &s;ub&s;ided into a determined, inflexible re&s;entment; by which he allowed him&s;elf to be &s;o completely governed, that he re&s;olved never more to behold his di&s;obedient &s;on; who mu&s;t have found him&s;elf ex|tremely embarra&s;&s;ed in his finances, had not my pur&s;e &s;upplied his nece&s;&s;ities to the utmo&s;t extent of my ability. In vain I repre&s;ented to my father that the alliance, though neither &s;plendid nor de&s;irable, was equally removed from what could be deemed di&s;graceful: he &s;ilenced me with vehemence; and &s;o|lemnly declared, that never more &s;hould my brother receive the &s;hadow of his
<PB N="25" REF="29">
countenance.&mdash;A re&s;olution, alas! which my &s;uperior mi&s;conduct alone, per&s;uaded him to relinqui&s;h.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummer after my return at my father's country &s;eat; and &s;pent great part of my time in hunting&mdash;my favourite amu&s;ement. Returning one day from the cha&s;e, the weather being extremely &s;ultry, my fatigue occa&s;ioned an extreme thir&s;t, which induced me to di&s;mount at the door of a farm-hou&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one of my father's tenants, not many miles from the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>As I knocked, the farmer him&s;elf appeared; and upon mentioning my name, and reque&s;ting a draught of &s;omething to refre&s;h me, he conducted me with the utmo&s;t hurry of civility into a &s;mall ru&s;tic parlour, where were &s;itting his wife and daughter. The latter a&s;toni&s;hed me with her uncommon beauty; which was rendered &s;till more intere&s;ting from having &s;urprized her in
<PB N="26" REF="30">
tears: &s;he allowed me no time however to contemplate her charms, for a&s;hamed of being caught by a &s;tranger in that &s;ituation, &s;he made no return to my &s;alutation, but ran ha&s;tily out of the room.</P>
<P>I made a thou&s;and apologies to the farmer's wife for my intru&s;ion; and &s;o greatly was I &s;truck with the daughter's appearance, that I could not help ex|pre&s;&s;ing my regret at beholding her in &s;uch affliction; which I intended as the lea&s;t inqui&s;itive method I could devi&s;e of enquiring the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Oh, nothing in the world, my Lord, &s;aid the farmer, your Lord&s;hip does her too much honour in ob&s;erving her. It would be very far either from her mo|ther's wi&s;h or mine to vex her, if &s;he would be per&s;uaded to li&s;ten to her own intere&s;t; but girls are &s;o wilful&mdash;</P>
<P>From this I conjectured what I after|wards learnt was the ca&s;e&mdash;that the old
<PB N="27" REF="31">
people were teazing their daughter to di&s;po&s;e of her hand contrary to her in|clination. But though I felt my&s;elf unaccountably intere&s;ted in what I had &s;een, it was nece&s;&s;ary that my enquiries &s;hould immediately end, as the good woman came at that in&s;tant to &s;upply me with what I had a&s;ked for, and I was con&s;trained unwillingly to depart.</P>
<P>This beautiful girl ran in my head the whole day: though I make no doubt but I &s;hould have forgotten that &s;he exi&s;ted in a week, had not my infant pa&s;&s;ion been nouri&s;hed by &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances which afterwards occurred.</P>
<P>When I returned to dinner, I found a large party of neighbours who were paying vi&s;its of congratulation at the Ca&s;tle on account of my &s;i&s;ter Lady Ann's marriage with Mr. Vere, an event that had taken place a few weeks before. In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation at ta|ble, I mentioned my little adventure,
<PB N="28" REF="32">
particularly dwelling on the extreme beauty and di&s;tre&s;s of the tenant's daughter.&mdash;Yes, cried the curate, who happened to be pre&s;ent, Fanny is the prettie&s;t girl in the pari&s;h, and one of the be&s;t; but her parents have carried matters much too far, and have ren|dered her quite mi&s;erable, by in&s;i&s;ting on the poor young woman's di&s;po&s;ing of her&s;elf to fat Robin, your Lord&s;hip's gamekeeper. They have teazed and tormented her till they had almo&s;t driven her to venture on a very alarming &s;tep, to get rid of their importunities; &s;he had privately determined to leave home, and take her chance of finding a &s;ervice in town; but my wife &s;u&s;pecting her intention, deterred her from a &s;cheme &s;o fraught with danger, by repre&s;enting the hazards attending &s;uch an exploit.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation &s;hifted to other to|picks; but Fanny and her di&s;tre&s;s fre|quently occurred to my mind. I wi&s;hed
<PB N="29" REF="33">
much to deliver her from it; but I di&s;tru&s;ted my&s;elf &s;o little, as never once to &s;u&s;pect I was actuated in my wi&s;hes to relieve her by any other motive than that intere&s;t which youth and beauty, even without having produced any par|ticular predeliction, &s;eldom fail to excite in hearts of common &s;en&s;ibility. She appeared &s;o amiable and &s;o innocent, that, free as were my notions on certain &s;ubjects, the idea of deriving any &s;ini&s;ter advantage to my&s;elf by relea&s;ing her from her pre&s;ent per&s;ecutions, never entered my imagination.</P>
<P>I contrived, as the be&s;t method of &s;uc|ceeding I could devi&s;e, to intere&s;t Lady Ann in the affair; who during her walks called at the farmer's, and repre&s;ented &s;o &s;trongly to his wife, who had been an old &s;ervant in the family, the cruelty and inju&s;tice of forcing her daughter into the arms of a man &s;he dete&s;ted, that the old woman was prevailed on to give up the point
<PB N="30" REF="34">
her&s;elf, and faithfully promi&s;ed to u&s;e all her influence with her hu&s;band to per&s;uade him to relinqui&s;h the plan likewi&s;e. In this vi&s;it my &s;i&s;ter was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the bewitching &s;im|plicity of Fanny's manners and appear|ance, and the unbounded gratitude &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for this obligation, that &s;he made her an offer of &s;upplying the place of her maid, who was ju&s;t leaving her. Fanny thankfully accepted the propo&s;al; and the old people, happy in thinking their daughter &s;ettled under the pro|tection of Lady Ann, con&s;ented with eagerne&s;s to the mea&s;ure; &s;o that on my return from a &s;hort excur&s;ion I had made about that time, I found Fanny actually re&s;iding in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The frequent opportunities I now enjoyed of &s;eeing her, in a &s;hort time convinced me I was not proof again&s;t her charms. Far, however, from &s;tifling this flame in its progre&s;s, I allowed it
<PB N="31" REF="35">
every encouragement and indulgence. Some &s;imilar amours abroad, into which bad company and ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions led me, had already blunted, though not eradicated, my fir&s;t feelings of re|pugnance at the idea of &s;eduction; and I retained merely virtue &s;ufficient to undergo that penance, which con&s;cience, except where the heart is hardened in iniquity, never fails to exact from vice upon every new violation of her laws. But the&s;e tran&s;ient &s;cruples were not &s;ufficiently powerful to enable me to li&s;ten to dictates &s;o au&s;tere; I had little fear of being un&s;ucce&s;sful with a young country girl who had not as yet, I imagined, formed any attachment, and who&s;e heart, I concluded, would ea&s;ily yield to the vanity of having engaged mine. I therefore a&s;&s;ailed this amiable and unfortunate girl, with all the warmth and force of the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion; but I &s;oon found that an innate love of
<PB N="32" REF="36">
virtue, and &s;entiments of pride &s;uperior to her condition, induced her to reject my offers and advances with horror and di&s;dain. I was not, however, repul&s;ed: the &s;ucce&s;s attending former pur&s;uits made me &s;till confident of prevailing in the end; but the re&s;i&s;tance I met with &s;o inflamed and augmented my affection, that from an in&s;inuating inclination, which might have been in its infancy ea&s;ily &s;ubdued, I found this attachment was become a violent and unmanageable pa&s;&s;ion, that, in its con&s;equences, in|volved both its innocent object and my|&s;elf in mi&s;ery and ruin.</P>
<P>I became at la&s;t alarmed on perceiving how e&s;&s;ential this affair was grown to my repo&s;e; that Fanny was every hour gaining ground in my heart and ri&s;ing in my e&s;timation, while I &s;eemed as far as ever from making any progre&s;s in hers; and I began to think her worthy of a more honourable flame, and to
<PB N="33" REF="37">
compa&s;&s;ionate the unea&s;ine&s;s into which my &s;olicitations had thrown her.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceived that for my own happine&s;s as well as hers, my importu|nities had been carried greatly too far, and I determined to make one great effort to re&s;tore my own tranquillity and her peace; but I did not con&s;ider how difficult the ta&s;k would prove; unu&s;ed to con&s;traint, accu&s;tomed to give incli|nation full &s;wing, to conquer at once a predilection &s;o formidable, was an un|dertaking much too violent with which to begin my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of &s;elf-denial. I re&s;olved, however, to try the effects of ab&s;ence, a medicine of wonderful efficacy in di&s;ea&s;es of the heart; and accordingly propo&s;ed to make an excur&s;ion of a few weeks, accompanied by &s;ome friends who were at that time my father's gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>On the evening previous to our de|parture, fatigued with the exertions which the attentions due to a large com|pany
<PB N="34" REF="38">
of ladies exacted, exhau&s;ted by overacted endeavours to appear in &s;pirits, and &s;ick of a frivolous conver&s;ation, which amu&s;ed minds at ea&s;e within them|&s;elves, and who willingly laid hold for entertainment on every little trifle that occurred, I contrived to &s;lip away in the height of their mirth, intending to &s;troll out towards the wood, to &s;oothe my un|ea&s;ine&s;s by giving way to reflexions which oppre&s;&s;ed and overpowered me.</P>
<P>The night was uncommonly delight|ful, and the full moon &s;hone with a clearne&s;s which reflected a plea&s;ing &s;ere|nity on every object around. I gave way to a train of ideas, that filled me not only with angui&s;h but alarm; I found that my pa&s;&s;ion for a girl &s;o every way beneath me po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only the power of de&s;troying my peace, but even in &s;ome mea&s;ure had weakened my rea&s;on: for &s;o entirely had my heart &s;urrendered to its influence, that the
<PB N="35" REF="39">
thoughts of relinqui&s;hing every pro&s;pect of preferment and dignity in my future e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the certainty of ruin|ing my&s;elf with my father, were le&s;s dreadful to my apprehen&s;ion than the re&s;olution of thwarting an attachment, to which &s;eemed annexed every hope of hap|pine&s;s and enjoyment: in a word&mdash;that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fanny in a legal manner was more than a recompence for the many evils which I knew mu&s;t follow &s;uch a &s;tep.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted from my reverie, when I found how unju&s;tifiably far my imagina|tion had carried me; and endeavoured to repre&s;ent to my&s;elf the weakne&s;s and folly, as well as the danger, attending the indulgence of &s;uch reflections. Per|ceiving how fatally &s;olitude and mu&s;ing enfeeble fortitude and nouri&s;h the foibles of the heart, I was about to return back to the hou&s;e, when a voice which I heard at &s;ome di&s;tance, induced me to &s;top for
<PB N="36" REF="40">
a moment; and in&s;tantly recollecting it to be my dear Fanny's, my intention of returning was immediately converted into a re&s;olution of approaching as &s;oftly as po&s;&s;ible to the place where &s;he &s;at, in order to overhear her conver&s;ation. This I effected with great caution; and found &s;he was enjoying the cool of the evening in company with one of her companions, and that not fearing in|terruption from any of the family at that hour, they had ventured to &s;eat them|&s;elves at the &s;ide of &s;ome bu&s;hes in the &s;hrubbery.</P>
<P>I heard the friend, in a voice of com|pa&s;&s;ion, endeavouring to &s;oothe Fanny in con&s;equence of &s;ome complaint which I concluded &s;he had been confiding to her, and to which the mo&s;t mournful &s;ighs were on her part the only replies. Her arguments of comfort were not in|deed the be&s;t calculated for con&s;olation,
<PB N="37" REF="41">
but they were de&s;igned for &s;ympathy and expre&s;&s;ed with much &s;implicity.</P>
<P>Indeed my dear Fanny, &s;aid &s;he, could you have been per&s;uaded to have accepted of my cou&s;in, you would have e&s;caped all this trouble and vexation. Time goes a great way in conquering people's di&s;likes. What one likes at one time one can't abide at another; and the contrary is ju&s;t as common. When once Mr. Robert was your hu&s;|band, you would have been obliged to have loved him; and he loves you &s;o well, you know, that it mu&s;t have come of cour&s;e. If all this had happened now, and I'm &s;ure I always told you that you never would do &s;o well el&s;ewhere, there would have been no word of his young Lord&s;hip, and your heart would have been as light as mine is at this in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Talk not to me of your cou&s;in, cried Fanny in a tone of impatience mixed with de&s;pondency&mdash;I hate and dete&s;t him.
<PB N="38" REF="42">
What have I not &s;uffered, added &s;he, melting into tears after a &s;hort pau&s;e, within the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix &s;ad months: tor|mented by that hateful man, teized by my mother, terrified by my father; no &s;ooner had I got rid of that per&s;ecution, than I came hither to endure another a thou&s;and times more in&s;upportable; and what cour&s;e can I po&s;&s;ibly now pur&s;ue, which is not loaded with difficulties and attended on all &s;ides with danger. If I return home, I dread reviving the old &s;tory; if I remain here, then certain mi|&s;ery awaits me; and oh! at times, my dear Jenny, at times I am almo&s;t ter|rified for my&s;elf; for though from my heart I abhor my Lord's in&s;ulting offers and propo&s;als, yet alas! my heart is weak, and I find it is impo&s;&s;ible to abhor <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I often wi&s;h, continued &s;he, in the &s;ame mournful accents, that I had either died la&s;t year, when I was &s;o ill and all
<PB N="39" REF="43">
my friends were weeping round me&mdash; ah! what angui&s;h had I been &s;pared!&mdash; or that it had plea&s;ed God to have placed me in a &s;ituation le&s;s beneath the only man who ever made the &s;lighte&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion on my heart. But this is a wi&s;h which carries me &s;o far, and &s;oftens me &s;o &s;adly, that I dare not allow my&s;elf to dwell upon it. Yet, Jenny, I cannot re|&s;i&s;t &s;ome times indulging the idea of what un&s;peakable happine&s;s mu&s;t have been my lot, had the Almighty le&s;&s;ened the immen&s;e di&s;tance between us, and I had &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ing of being agree|able to him. Had it &s;o happened; had I been placed in his &s;tation, and he been in mine, I'm certain I &s;hould have joy|fully overlooked every objection to have made <HI>him</HI> happy: and I often think, if his Lord&s;hip profe&s;&s;es to love me &s;o well now, when I u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to conceal my fatal partiality, &s;urely he would not have loved me le&s;s, when all
<PB N="40" REF="44">
my happine&s;s centered in the wi&s;h of being agreeable in his eyes: yet as mat|ters go with great people, <HI>he</HI> will proba|bly marry &s;ome rich lady, continued &s;he, her tears flowing abundantly, who may regard nothing but his fine e&s;tate and &s;plendid titles, and one be&s;ides whom he may not even him&s;elf love; for great people do not marry as we do.</P>
<P>What a &s;ad thing it is, that all great gentlemen are &s;uch rakes, cried the friend. But could you not contrive to give your lady warning. I'll warrant a few weeks ab&s;ence will put all to rights.</P>
<P>That is what I have often thought of, cried the other, and what I am afraid I &s;hall be con&s;trained to do at la&s;t; but oh! my dear Jenny! what will not &s;uch a &s;tep co&s;t me? &s;hall I be able to live, after I quit the ca&s;tle? But to be &s;ure quit it I mu&s;t, and the &s;ooner I die the better.</P>
<P>Nay, for my part, I know nothing half &s;o frightful as dying, I promi&s;e you,
<PB N="41" REF="45">
cried the friend. How can you talk &s;o wildly? But you'll think better of that, I tru&s;t, before long: you are not the fir&s;t, God knows, that has been cro&s;&s;ed in love, and people don't always die for all that.</P>
<P>Melted beyond expre&s;&s;ion by what I overheard, I &s;carce breathed, from the fear of lo&s;ing one word of this artle&s;s, intere&s;ting conver&s;ation. When the friend aro&s;e, and propo&s;ed returning home, I heard Fanny offer to accompany her part of the way to the village, &s;ay|ing &s;he was not afraid, though alone and &s;o late, as the moon &s;hone bright, and &s;he would return by a private gate which led from the park into the fields, and was a near cut. They immediately walked away, and I remained in a &s;tate of mind not to be conceived but in &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery I had made of my gen|tle Fanny's amiable partiality, in the very moment that I was exhau&s;ting every
<PB N="42" REF="46">
&s;ource of fortitude to enable me to re|nounce her, threw me into a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction; and determined me at once to overleap all the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s that lay in the way, and to offer her my hand and heart in a legal manner. This re&s;o|lution, the offspring of an overheated imagination, and of that impetuo&s;ity of temper which in a thou&s;and in&s;tances I have had &s;uch cau&s;e to deplore, I re&s;olved in&s;tantly to make known to her, and to wait her return at the little gate, in order to communicate it. During this inter|val, in&s;tead of recalling my rea&s;on to my aid, and maturely weighing the con|&s;equences of &s;o imprudent a determina|tion, I gave way to the delirium, and indulged in a train of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and flattering illu&s;ions: I imagined I was beginning to enjoy a foreta&s;te of that happine&s;s from which an ab&s;urd prejudice had too long pre|cluded me; and I carefully checked
<PB N="43" REF="47">
every ri&s;ing objection to a mea&s;ure which already diffu&s;ed &s;uch infinite &s;atisfaction over my mind.</P>
<P>I walked backwards and forwards, an|ticipating that delight in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dear object of my affections, which with &s;uch amiable &s;implicity &s;he her&s;elf had de&s;cribed but the moment before, and dwelt with particular plea&s;ure on the &s;oothing idea of the height to which gratitude mu&s;t rai&s;e her attachment when &s;he came to know what proofs I meant to give her of mine.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Fanny appeared in &s;ight, and I flew towards her. I acknowledged the enchanting di&s;covery I had made, and the effect <HI>that</HI> di&s;covery had produced upon my heart, till wholly overpowered with my vows and prote&s;tations, &s;he wept in my arms, and confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he loved me above all men. We were in this &s;ituation, when the &s;upper bell obliged us to &s;eparate. Fanny, agitated
<PB N="44" REF="48">
and bewildered by this unexpected event, and apprehen&s;ive of detection, at length prevailed with me, though not without difficulty, to leave her, having promi&s;ed to meet me in the wood early next morn|ing.</P>
<P>On my return to the company, I found my brother in law had received letters from town which required his immediate attendance there. As my &s;i&s;ter of cour&s;e accompanied him, I knew Fanny mu&s;t be of the party; and to leave her now, was as far di&s;tant from my thoughts as it had been fixed in my determination three hours before. I therefore pre|tended to have had di&s;patches by the &s;ame po&s;t, which obliged me to vi&s;it London likewi&s;e; and without much difficulty got my&s;elf excu&s;ed from the excur&s;ion which had originally been planned by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>When I retired to re&s;t, I had lei&s;ure to reflect on the events of the day. My
<PB N="45" REF="49">
mind having time to cool, I began clearly to &s;ee that I was &s;tanding on the thre&s;hold of danger. Fanny's image however, which perpetually pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view, and the recollection of the &s;cene which &s;o lately had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us, the vows that had proceeded from my lips, warm from my heart, and the &s;oft gratitude &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed in terms &s;o endearing, all fixed me immove|ably in my determination; though I per|ceived through the cloud which pa&s;&s;ion threw over my rea&s;on, a &s;ource of innu|merable troubles and objections; but the&s;e gloomy &s;ugge&s;tions a lively imagi|nation and &s;anguine hopes, enabled me quickly to cha&s;e from my thoughts.</P>
<P>I began at la&s;t to form a &s;cheme to which I hoped my dear Fanny would ea&s;ily be induced to con&s;ent: this was, to be united to her privately, and care|fully to conceal the connection till my father's death &s;hould leave me at liberty
<PB N="46" REF="50">
to avow my choice; and this, with ex|treme caution, I concluded might be effected.</P>
<P>On meeting next morning, I commu|nicated my plan, which met with my dear girl's approbation: one circum&s;tance alone gave her unea&s;ine&s;s and held her de|termination for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended; this was, how &s;he &s;hould conduct her&s;elf with regard to her parents, to whom &s;he was tenderly attached, and who, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he well knew mu&s;t receive a mortal wound were they to imagine her capable of con&s;enting to any &s;tep prejudicial to her reputation. It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to agree to their being informed of our private marriage, as &s;o many rea&s;ons required it to be kept an inviolable &s;e|cret; and there was &s;o little probability that two old people of their condition would pre&s;erve concealed, what a due regard to the honour of their only child mu&s;t prompt them to divulge, when her elopement and concealment &s;hould call
<PB N="47" REF="51">
her fame in que&s;tion. This was &s;o ap|parent, that Fanny was ea&s;ily convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity, however di&s;agreeable, of leaving them in ignorance. The idea however of embittering their days with the belief of her &s;eduction drove her al|mo&s;t to de&s;pair: yet it is not &s;urprizing that my arguments and endearments, my promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions, &s;hould have gradually reconciled her to inflicting this blow; as I did not fail to &s;ugge&s;t the triumph they would one day experience in the di&s;covery of her exaltation and in|nocence; be&s;ides that I propo&s;ed to &s;of|ten their anxiety by dictating a letter, which Fanny actually wrote to her mo|ther, acquainting her that for rea&s;ons &s;he was not at liberty to reveal, &s;he was forced to conceal her&s;elf for a &s;ea&s;on from them and the world, but that a period would certainly arrive when &s;he &s;hould again embrace them; adding many a&s;&s;urances that when &s;he &s;hould have that happine&s;s,
<PB N="48" REF="52">
it would be without a blu&s;h for her pa&s;t conduct, which ever had been, and ever &s;hould continue to be, conformable to the principles and in&s;tructions &s;he had early imbibed from them. Fanny like|wi&s;e promi&s;ed to give them intelligence of her welfare from time to time, if they would have the goodne&s;s &s;till to intere&s;t them&s;elves in their child's hap|pine&s;s, while appearances were &s;o unfa|vourable to her. This method, together with an annual &s;um, which I promi&s;ed to remit to them without a po&s;&s;ibility of their tracing from whence it came, made my Fanny tolerably ea&s;y; or rather the &s;oftne&s;s of her nature con&s;piring with her tenderne&s;s, overcame her &s;cruples, and &s;he li&s;tened to a plan &s;he knew not how to improve.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s at this time called my brother and &s;i&s;ter to vi&s;it an e&s;tate lately left him in Scotland by a di&s;tant relation. I im|mediately propo&s;ed being of the party,
<PB N="49" REF="53">
pretending an inclination to vi&s;it that part of the i&s;land, con&s;cious that I could there compleat my &s;cheme with the mo&s;t &s;ecurity from &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>We accordingly &s;et off; and on our arrival at Edinburgh, Fanny, who was innocence her&s;elf, allowed me to con|duct her to a private part of the town, where a clergyman, whom I had en|gaged to &s;ecrecy both by bribes and the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, performed the cere|mony which united her to me by laws both human and divine.</P>
<P>I will confe&s;s to you, my children, humiliating as is the avowal, that the confidence placed in me more than once tempted me to betray it; and that the facility with which it was in my power to have deluded my artle&s;s bride with a fal&s;e marriage, held the execution of my project for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended: but though the whole tran&s;action confe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="50" REF="54">
an unpardonable weakne&s;s, in this in&s;tance it was un&s;tained with guilt.</P>
<P>Our journey down gave me opportuni|ties of meeting with Fanny, and con|ver&s;ing with her more un&s;u&s;pectedly than I could otherwi&s;e have hoped for; yet I could perceive that my &s;i&s;ter was not without her &s;u&s;picions of my partiality for her maid, and very often rallied me on it, though &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly have conceived the &s;lighte&s;t idea of the impru|dence into which my fatal weakne&s;s had involved me.</P>
<P>That my wife &s;hould continue a mo|ment in her pre&s;ent humble &s;ituation about my &s;i&s;ter, was what I could by no means brook. Two days therefore after our union, which had taken place on the day of our arrival, by my contrivance &s;he pretended to have received accounts of her mother's being dangerou&s;ly ill, and reque&s;ted leave to return home with all expedition, in order to give her the
<PB N="51" REF="55">
nece&s;&s;ary attendance. It was not with|out infinite reluctance that the dear girl was prevailed on to adopt this little artifice; and the tears &s;he &s;hed at part|ing from Lady Ann, to whom &s;he was tenderly attached, mu&s;t inevitably have excited &s;ome &s;u&s;picion that &s;he meant to return to her no more, had not the occa|&s;ion of her departure furni&s;hed an appa|rent excu&s;e for them.</P>
<P>As I had time to dige&s;t my &s;cheme before it was put into execution, I had provided a &s;mall hou&s;e in a private &s;treet in London for the re&s;idence of my wife, under the name of Mrs. Smith. There I hoped to vi&s;it her frequently, un&s;u&s;|pected by the world, and thither I was eager to follow her. Prudence however required that I &s;hould remain behind with my &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band; but as they continued only a few weeks at their new e&s;tate, my impatience was &s;oon gra|tified by our return to London, where I
<PB N="52" REF="56">
met my lovely bride with all the ardour and impatience natural to my di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>For &s;ome months my pa&s;&s;ion, far from &s;uffering any abatement, rather &s;eemed to encrea&s;e. At this time my father came up to town; and as I lodged with him, I was con&s;trained to vi&s;it le&s;s often in the city, and with redoubled caution; but the difficulties which retarded our meetings, and their con&s;equent infre|quency, gave them an un&s;peakable charm&mdash;a charm, alas! the warmth of which a &s;hort time dimini&s;hed!</P>
<P>The entire &s;olitude in which my wife lived (for I was her only vi&s;itor) made my &s;ociety and conver&s;ation her only happine&s;s and amu&s;ement. Her educa|tion had totally unfitted her for mental entertainments; nor had &s;he been taught tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which fill up agreeably the lei&s;ure hours of a woman of fa&s;hion, and from the unavoidable re|tirement in which &s;he lived, little variety
<PB N="53" REF="57">
of conver&s;ation was po&s;&s;ible: when there|fore the mi&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion began to di&s;&s;ipate, I found her &s;till lovely, amiable, and in|nocent; but unfortunately perceived that the&s;e alluring qualities were not in them|&s;elves &s;ufficient to retain my wandering affections. Her conver&s;ation &s;oon be|came in&s;ipid to me; and the de&s;ire of embelli&s;hing her mind by directing her &s;tudies (at fir&s;t my mo&s;t plea&s;ing amu&s;e|ment) now cea&s;ed to intere&s;t me. The tenderne&s;s of her affection long pre|vented her from expre&s;&s;ing even a murmur at my too apparent neglect; although I could not but perceive that her &s;pirits were vi&s;ibly affected by it: and &s;he always re|ceived me, after a fortnight's &s;olitary ab&s;ence, with the mo&s;t lively expre&s;&s;ions of joy.</P>
<P>It was not immediately however that this unhappy change took place: and your birth, my Hermione, which hap|pened not till three years after our mar|riage,
<PB N="54" REF="58">
&s;upplied your mother with a plea&s;ing &s;ource of amu&s;ement, &s;ufficiently inte|re&s;ting I hope to prevent her thoughts from brooding over the mortifying and painful alteration in my behaviour.</P>
<P>At this period I became acquainted with a &s;et of companions of the mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated character. My particular friends were two young men of agreeable and in&s;inuating, but of profligate manners. In their company I led the mo&s;t irregular life: and &s;oon began to con&s;ider the hours I &s;pent occa&s;ionally with my wife as a point of duty rather than of inclination, and with regard to the di&s;charge of duties which in|terfered with my plea&s;ures, I grew every day le&s;s &s;olicitous: this therefore, among the re&s;t, became extremely neglected; and I heartily regretted the indi&s;&s;oluble knot which had placed your mother in a &s;ituation that rendered my attentions ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to her happine&s;s: the &s;eclu&s;ion of her life affected, but it
<PB N="55" REF="59">
al&s;o chagrined me; and her dependance, once &s;o plea&s;ing, &s;eemed now a burthen that I endeavoured to &s;hake off, flatter|ing my&s;elf that her child would amply compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of my &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Twelve or fourteen months pa&s;&s;ed on in this manner; till my wife, at length wounded to the &s;oul, began to adopt the wor&s;t of all methods for recovering a lo&s;t attachment, by complaining of my cold|ne&s;s. This &s;he did with her accu&s;tomed &s;oftne&s;s, and by tears rather than re|proaches; but it was a &s;ubject which embittered &s;o extremely the &s;hort inter|vals I &s;pent with her, that they grew le&s;s frequent than ever, although the birth of her &s;econd child (you, my dear Fanny) ought to have proved an addi|tional tie towards cementing my affection.</P>
<P>My father, who regarded him&s;elf as exceedingly unfortunate in my brother's marriage, often propo&s;ed to me to marry, and had at different periods pointed out
<PB N="56" REF="60">
&s;everal advantageous connexions, among whom he wi&s;hed me to choo&s;e; but as my heart was not intere&s;ted, though the &s;ubject embarra&s;&s;ed, it did not wound me, and I evaded it with little difficulty.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, one evening at her hou&s;e, introduced to me a young lady with whom &s;he had been on a footing of the &s;tricte&s;t intimacy whil&s;t I was on my travels, but whom, till now, I had never &s;een, owing to her having accom|panied her father to the Court of Turin, where he re&s;ided in a public character, and from which place &s;he was but ju&s;t returned.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Mar&s;don was uncommonly beau|tiful; and her manners and addre&s;s, though highly cultivated, pre&s;erved an intere&s;ting &s;implicity which rendered her perfectly irre&s;i&s;tible: her conver&s;ation, refined by an admirable under&s;tanding, embelli&s;hed by education, and poli&s;hed by an early introduction into the mo&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="61">
polite company abroad, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ea&s;e and delicacy of good breeding almo&s;t as &s;triking, at fir&s;t &s;ight, as the charms of her figure.&mdash;I felt the full force of both, and was conquered at once. With the blind impetuo&s;ity which marked my character, in&s;tead of exerting my utmo&s;t efforts to re&s;i&s;t and avoid a temptation I found too in&s;inuating, I gave way to this &s;educing pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;hut my eyes on its unhappy con&s;equences, &s;o fraught with mi&s;ery, remor&s;e, and guilt. It was then that I cur&s;ed my folly, and that infatuation which had before guided me. Ever violent and untractable, I was almo&s;t driven to de&s;pair at the re|collection of the weakne&s;s which had placed a bar &s;o in&s;uperable between me and my wi&s;hes. But there &s;oon aro&s;e in my brea&s;t a ray of hope; the production of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and treachery, which fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted an action that has thrown the gloom of the
<PB N="58" REF="62">
bittere&s;t &s;elf-reproach on all the &s;ucceed|ing years of my life.</P>
<P>The lovely Mi&s;s Mar&s;don, an only child, and heire&s;s to an immen&s;e fortune, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable e&s;tate which &s;he had inherited from her mother, and which lay contiguous to Belmont Ca&s;tle. This circum&s;tance, though trivial in it&s;elf, had induced my father often to expre&s;s his wi&s;hes that a marriage between the young lady and my&s;elf might take place. Her ab&s;ence had hitherto entirely fru&s;ta|ted this plan, and given birth to other &s;chemes; but her unexpected return at this juncture made him directly renew the old topic of matrimony, to which, hitherto, I had never been prevailed on to li&s;ten. Far from being aver&s;e to this match, he &s;aid he &s;aw with plea&s;ure it was an union into which I would enter with avidity; and that as the young lady her&s;elf &s;eemed, if he might judge from appearances, to receive my atten|tions
<PB N="59" REF="63">
with all the mode&s;t approbation I could wi&s;h, he thought the next &s;tep was to apply to his old friend Lord Emb|don for his &s;anction and con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The mention of &s;uch a tran&s;action made my blood run cold, and I received it with an embarra&s;&s;ment which not only a&s;toni&s;hed but extremely di&s;plea&s;ed my father; though, at the very moment that I half declined what my heart panted to obtain, I was revolving in my mind the means of bringing &s;uch a &s;cheme to bear. The &s;ucce&s;s hitherto attending my attempt of concealment, encouraged me, and I began to flatter my&s;elf that my engagements with your mother might remain an eternal &s;ecret to the world, which would leave me at liberty to form what new ones I plea&s;ed with the amiable object of my pre&s;ent affections; this, I imagined, might for many years remain unknown to my real wife, who &s;aw only her own &s;ervants,
<PB N="60" REF="64">
none of whom had been informed of my name, and who, being perfectly unac|quainted even with the meaning of the word politics, had ever declared that new&s;papers were the dulle&s;t of all read|ing; and I knew &s;he received none of the daily prints into her family. All the&s;e circum&s;tances induced me to hope that &s;he might long continue in ignorance; and that when the fatal in|telligence, that I had connected my&s;elf with another, &s;hould at length reach her ears, and &s;he knew my heart was totally alienated from her, I believed, or rather I forced my&s;elf to believe, that the gen|tlene&s;s of her nature would never allow her to plunge me at once into infamy and contempt by detection, but that &s;he might without difficulty be per&s;uaded, as the calamity was without remedy, to re&s;t &s;atisfied in ob&s;curity, with con&s;cious innocence and affluence, all that had hitherto been her &s;olitary portion. This
<PB N="61" REF="65">
certainly was a de&s;ign which a thou&s;and unfore&s;een accidents might di&s;clo&s;e to the world, and, at be&s;t, extremely im|probable to effect; but I was willingly blind to the future, and &s;olicitous only for the gratification of the pre&s;ent mo|ment. I con&s;idered al&s;o, that &s;hould your mother's ju&s;t re&s;entment prompt her to divulge the truth, the mea&s;ures I had taken, though not with that in|tention at the time, had all con&s;pired to prevent any credit from being given to her a&s;&s;ertions: the ceremony had been performed in Scotland; the clergyman's abode &s;he knew not, nor was &s;he ac|quainted with his name but from the certificate of our marriage, which indeed &s;till remained in her hands, and which I regarded as the only bar. I often there|fore revolved on the means of getting it into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and mo&s;t un|doubtedly &s;hould one day or other have effected it, but con&s;cious guilt prevented
<PB N="62" REF="66">
me at the time from venturing on any &s;teps towards this end, terrified to awaken &s;u&s;picion while my plot was but in agitation.</P>
<P>It was not without extreme angui&s;h that I con&s;idered the felicity I was pur|cha&s;ing for my&s;elf mu&s;t be at the ex|pence of an amiable young creature's happine&s;s, who had once been the object of my warme&s;t affections, and who &s;till loved me pa&s;&s;ionately; who regarded me as her guardian and protector, who lived in a manner on my &s;miles, who&s;e countenance ever betrayed dejection on the &s;lighte&s;t appearance in mine either of indifference or ill humour, and who had brought me two lovely infants, pledges of her tenderne&s;s and of my treachery. But I quickly cha&s;ed away tho&s;e painful &s;ugge&s;tions of con&s;cience; drowned them in wine, or forgot them entirely at the fir&s;t glance of my beloved Julia.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="67">In a word, I made my addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Mar&s;den, and was accepted. My Lord, overjoyed at finding me willing at la&s;t to clo&s;e with his wi&s;hes, ha&s;tened the preliminaries; and Lord Embdon, happy in &s;ettling his daughter to his &s;atisfaction, (as there had ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip between him and my father) in&s;i&s;ted on celebrating our marriage at his country &s;eat in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous manner, where a number of relations on both &s;ides were to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>During the preparations, my heart, though &s;o near enjoying its utmo&s;t wi&s;h, was weighed down with a burthen of guilt, the &s;en&s;ation of which let none call them&s;elves mi&s;erable till they have endured; for perfect mi&s;ery cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the feelings of remor&s;e. As the time approached, my agitation be|came more violent; in the pre&s;ence of
<PB N="64" REF="68">
my lovely Julia they were annihilated, but alone they were in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Mar&s;don and her friends had al|ready left town, and I was to follow the next day, and the en&s;uing one was to determine my fate. On the evening previous to my departure, being unea&s;y in my mind, I re&s;olved to pay your mo|ther a vi&s;it, while I had not as yet actu|ally injured her: you will imagine this a &s;trange &s;tep in &s;uch circum&s;tances, when on the eve of inflicting a wound which mu&s;t for ever de&s;troy her tranquillity; but in fact I was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with a load of &s;ecret &s;ufferings, that it fell to me like the di&s;charge of a duty to which was attached &s;ome degree of merit from the pain it occa&s;ioned me. I found her low &s;pirited and indi&s;po&s;ed; &s;hall I add another circum&s;tance calculated to have awakened every &s;entiment of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, had not my heart been hardened and every feeling warped in

&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s&mdash;&s;he was with child, and had &s;uffered much from the attendant cir|cum&s;tances of her &s;ituation: this, toge|ther with the air of <HI>&s;ombre</HI> &s;eclu&s;ion which every thing wore, and which had never before &s;truck me &s;o forcibly, &s;oftened and affected me. Your mother was ill and alone; no parents to &s;oothe, no friends to attend her; all was gloomy and dejected around her; it was I that was the occa&s;ion of what &s;he now felt, and what &s;he had further to endure; yet &mdash;yet&mdash;I was villain enough to per&s;i&s;t in my intention to de&s;troy her! not but that a violent though tran&s;ient remor&s;e made me he&s;itate for a moment; but I pre|&s;ently laboured to &s;atisfy my con&s;cience with this &s;ophi&s;try, that I had gone too far now to retract, and that as I had probably engaged the affections both of my wife and of my mi&s;tre&s;s, and ren|dered their felicity dependant on mine, &s;ince one mu&s;t &s;uffer, it was at lea&s;t al|lowable

that I &s;hould &s;pare regret and di&s;appointment from being the portion of her who had it in her power to con|fer un&s;peakable happine&s;s on me.</P>
<P>As to your mother, the joy of &s;eeing me, and the unu&s;ual tenderne&s;s with which her &s;ituation in&s;pired me, made her di&s;&s;olve into tears that &s;ilently re|proached my perfidy. I pleaded an ex|cur&s;ion from town in excu&s;e for my long ab&s;ence, and informed her of an unavoid|able journey I was on the eve of taking which mu&s;t deprive me of the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her for a &s;till longer time. She did not utter a complaint; but drying up her tears, you have deprived your&s;elf of much plea&s;ure, my dear Lord, &s;aid &s;he; and in&s;tantly ordering the maid to bring the children to me began, with all the tenderne&s;s of a mother, to repeat the improvements you had both made &s;ince my la&s;t vi&s;it, which was about three months before, with many innocent ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="67" REF="71">

<P>The entrance of the maid, with Fanny in her arms and leading in Hermione, left the &s;entence unfini&s;hed which was a dagger to my heart. I think I was hardly ever more affected than when you, my Hermione, rejected my care&s;&s;es, and &s;eeing your mother's eyes red with weep|ing, a&s;ked me, with a re&s;entment which was immediately after followed by tears, why I made mama cry? This innocent reproach, under which lurked a meaning con&s;cious only to my&s;elf, made me heap

expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s on both the mo|ther and child, while I was preparing a blow for the former that laid her in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>I left the hou&s;e in a &s;tate of mind not to be expre&s;&s;ed. I &s;pent the fir&s;t part of the night in mi&s;ery: but the idea of what next morning was to be&s;tow, re|moved the image of your mother in tears, and pre&s;ented to me that of a lovely and beloved bride ready to give her&s;elf to my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;et out next day with a large &s;uite of friends, was married im|mediately on my arrival at the Hall, and had all my con&s;cientious &s;cruples &s;oon drowned in an intoxication of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After &s;pending &s;ome weeks in great gaiety, I carried my amiable bride to my father's country &s;eat, to which place we were accompanied by mo&s;t of the party; and here we continued the &s;ame round of amu&s;ements for a fortnight longer. My

<P>The company had ju&s;t returned one evening from an agreeable excur&s;ion on the water, and the ladies being in high &s;pirits, had in&s;i&s;ted on fiddles being &s;ent for, &s;o that a kind of ball was going for|ward on the lawn before the hou&s;e, the weather being uncommonly delightful, when my &s;ervant, calling me a&s;ide, deli|vered into my hands a letter, the &s;uper|&s;cription of which made me tremble. I ha&s;tened in&s;tantly to my own apart|ment; where, &s;ecuring my&s;elf from in|terruption, I found it, as I &s;u&s;pected, from your mother, and the contents as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD LINROSE.</HEAD>
<P>If your heart ever felt for one in&s;tant the affection you have a thou&s;and times

&s;worn to me, if during the whole cour&s;e of your life it has once been awakened by compa&s;&s;ion, think what &s;he who writes to you feels at this moment; think, that to the ruin of that &s;ame which you have clouded with &s;eeming guilt, and to the total alienation of that affection which has co&s;t me &s;o dear, is &s;uperadded the in&s;upportable mi&s;ery of knowing you to be treacherous and inhuman. Ah! my Lord! if your bo&s;om &s;till retains one vulnerable &s;pot, where pity is not de|barred an entrance, come to me in&s;tantly. The Almighty has lent a gracious ear to my petitions, and &s;hortly &s;hall you be relieved from the infamy of your pre&s;ent &s;tate. My fatigues and agitations have accelerated my pangs; I am even already ill; deny me not therefore this la&s;t &s;ad dying reque&s;t, and deny not your&s;elf the &s;atisfaction of receiving my forgivene&s;s; a circum&s;tance to which you will one day mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly attach

&s;ome degree of importance. Think of me as the mother of your children: come at lea&s;t and contemplate your own work, and behold me, in this di&s;mal cot|tage, expire in giving birth to an infant who&s;e premature exi&s;tence mu&s;t throw an eternal &s;tain upon its father's name.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to de&s;cribe my ago|nies on peru&s;ing this pathetic letter, every word of which gave me a mortal wound. All the terrors of my perfidy (till that in&s;tant too fatally lulled by oppo&s;ite pa&s;|&s;ions) at once a&s;&s;ailed me. The mi&s;ery in which my crimes had involved <HI>her</HI> who had once been the object of my ten|dere&s;t affections, the de&s;pair into which I was about to plunge <HI>her</HI> who at pre&s;ent engro&s;&s;ed them with &s;o much fervour, the grief and a&s;toni&s;hment of my family, my treachery expo&s;ed, my character bla&s;ted for ever, altogether excited &s;uch
<PB N="72" REF="76">
&s;entiments of horror as overpowered my &s;en&s;es, and almo&s;t bereaved me of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Having fortunately &s;ecured my&s;elf from interruption, I had a little time, after the fir&s;t &s;hock was over, to con&s;ider what &s;teps I ought to pur&s;ue in a moment &s;o replete with alarm. In the pre&s;ent exi|gency no time was to be lo&s;t. I there|fore determined to write a &s;hort billet in an&s;wer by the return of your mother's me&s;&s;enger. It was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k: to offer any thing like an apology, e&s;pecially on paper, was impo&s;&s;ible; to work on the &s;oftne&s;s of her nature was all my tru&s;t, and the only circum&s;tance on which I could build the &s;lighte&s;t foundation for hope. I made no attempt therefore to|wards vindicating my&s;elf; but re&s;erving that till I &s;hould &s;ee her, I only intimated in a few lines the angui&s;h her note had given me, confe&s;&s;ed appearances were again&s;t me, but faithfully promi&s;ed to pay her a vi&s;it next morning, at which
<PB N="73" REF="77">
time I &s;hould exert my utmo&s;t endea|vours to &s;atisfy and relieve her; con|cluding with the mo&s;t earne&s;t prayers and entreaties that &s;he would pre&s;erve as a profound &s;ecret, her name, her abode, and her connexion with me, which I added would plunge us both into imme|diate ruin and de&s;truction, were they to reach my father's knowledge.</P>
<P>I then enquired, though not without much perturbation, for the per&s;on who had brought the letter, and was told that a country girl had given it into the hands of the hou&s;ekeeper early that morning, but the party in which I had been en|gaged had prevented my receiving it till the evening, and the girl had left no me&s;&s;age to what place an an&s;wer might be &s;ent.</P>
<P>I was grieved to the &s;oul at this in|formation; for as it was impo&s;&s;ible for me, without exciting &s;urpri&s;e and per|haps &s;u&s;picion, to quit the hou&s;e at &s;o
<PB N="74" REF="78">
late an hour, I was con&s;trained to leave your unfortunate mother in the di&s;mal &s;u&s;pence of fruitle&s;s expectation.</P>
<P>My an&s;wer indeed, had &s;he received it, was little calculated to have afforded her con&s;olation; and my vi&s;it could only have confirmed her de&s;pair. I caught eagerly however at a faint ray of hope, which I cheri&s;hed even again&s;t rea&s;on and conviction, to prevent me from ab&s;olute frenzy, and I could not help re&s;ting with &s;ome &s;light degree of comfort on the mildne&s;s of this letter, though writ|ten in the heat of a re&s;entment &s;o ju&s;tly excited. Her gentle bo&s;om thought not of revenge: on the contrary, her vi&s;it to &s;ee me &s;eemed prompted by the de&s;ire of according me forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>But before I proceed in the recital of my own &s;ufferings, and the horrid &s;cene that awaited me on the dreadful day that &s;ucceeded to this mi&s;erable evening, let me previou&s;ly inform you, with as much
<PB N="75" REF="79">
compo&s;ure as I can a&s;&s;ume, of the hope|le&s;s fate of your innocent, your injured mother, who&s;e calamities I &s;hall ever, with the bittere&s;t remor&s;e, to my late&s;t moment deplore; and the relation of which recalls feelings &s;o acute as to tear my bo&s;om while I tran&s;mit them to paper.</P>
<P>In what manner &s;he became acquainted with the circum&s;tance of my marriage, I have never been able to di&s;cover. The per&s;on to whom I owe the following par|ticulars, which, however horrible, I was afterwards anxious to learn, and which, as a ju&s;t and penitential humiliation, I force my&s;elf minutely to relate, had not informed him&s;elf in that point; but the fact a thou&s;and ways was ever liable to detection. The in&s;tant the report reached your mother's ears, the cold neglect of my pa&s;t behaviour gave it an apparent credulity that di&s;tracted her. Deter|mined to be at once either plunged into
<PB N="76" REF="80">
de&s;pair by the confirmation of my guilt, or relieved from the agonizing &s;u&s;picions of her mind, &s;he left London and &s;et off for Netwall, from which place Belmont is but three miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Afraid to be recognized &s;o near the abode of her youthful and happier days, &s;he borrowed of the woman of the inn a large cloak and hood to di&s;gui&s;e her; and terrified to intru&s;t a me&s;&s;enger, or|dered a chai&s;e to convey her within half a mile of the ca&s;tle; where having di&s;|charged it, &s;he walked forward with a note in her hand, intimating that &s;he waited for me in the wood, where &s;he entreated me, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t man|ner, by all my vows of unabating tender|ne&s;s and by every motive of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion, to meet her immediately.</P>
<P>The&s;e few lines &s;he meant her&s;elf to deliver to any of the &s;ervants &s;he might meet; but what, alas! were her emo|tions, when on approaching the park
<PB N="77" REF="81">
gate with timid and he&s;itating &s;teps, &s;he perceived from behind &s;ome bu&s;hes, where &s;he ha&s;tily concealed her&s;elf, a train of carriages, among which &s;he in&s;tantly &s;ingled me out, &s;eated in my phaeton with a lady who&s;e appearance at the fir&s;t glance confirmed all her apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Some little interruption (for &s;he after|wards related every particular to her mo|ther, who in the bitterne&s;s of de&s;pair re|capitulated them minutely to my infor|mer) obliged me to &s;top &s;o near, that &s;he ob&s;erved, or fancied &s;he ob&s;erved me, ad|dre&s;s my companion with a look of af|fection; I even kept her hand for an in&s;tant; and my voice, which reached her ears, though imperfectly, &s;eemed &s;oftened by tenderne&s;s; while that &s;ound, which hitherto had ever conveyed joy and exultation to your mother's bo&s;om, produced now on her heart the effect of a &s;udden &s;troke of lightning.</P>
<P>My countenance, however, wore a
<PB N="78" REF="82">
look of gaiety which accorded &s;o ill with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ecret guilt, that the next moment &s;he condemned the injury &s;he imagined her &s;u&s;picions did me, and even endeavoured to accu&s;e her own ha&s;ty jealou&s;y, which had inflicted &s;uch mi&s;ery without any foundation for actual de&s;pair. Momentary alas! was this illu|&s;ion; for as the equipages, attended by &s;everal gentlemen on hor&s;eback, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;pot where &s;he had concealed her&s;elf, &s;he plainly overheard one of them &s;ay to his friend, <HI>how divinely hand&s;ome Lady Linro&s;e looks to-day.</HI> Her heart died within her at the&s;e words, and &s;he &s;unk in&s;en&s;ible on the ground.</P>
<P>Her &s;en&s;es were quickly re&s;tored: but returning recollection brought with it &s;uch a weight of angui&s;h and de&s;pair, as made her lament the tediou&s;ne&s;s of death, from whence alone &s;he could now hope for relief to her wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>She endeavoured however to &s;ugge&s;t
<PB N="79" REF="83">
a feeble hope almo&s;t again&s;t conviction, to enable her to exi&s;t till my return &s;hould explain all: for having heard one of the footmen mention that the company would be home to dinner, &s;he concluded we were upon an excur&s;ion of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Her health having been declining for &s;ome months, had much impaired her &s;trength; and it would have been im|po&s;&s;ible for her to have undergone the fatigues &s;he had that day endured, had not the agitations of her mind &s;upplied a fal&s;e power of exertion, not unlike the delu&s;ive &s;upport of a fever, which be&s;tows for a moment an additional but de&s;tructive vigour; for &s;he perceived not that &s;he was feeble and exhau&s;ted while her &s;pirits and her feelings were all in conflict.</P>
<P>At length &s;he formed a plan to wait my return on the &s;pot where &s;he was, and to &s;eize the opportunity of giving her note to one of my attendants after I
<PB N="80" REF="84">
&s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed on, with injunctions to deliver it privately into my own hands. Finding &s;he had probably &s;everal hours to wait, &s;he endeavoured to compo&s;e her mind: and employed her&s;elf in offering up prayers to the Almighty to avert her misfortunes, or to enable her to en|dure them with humble and becoming &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and that if it plea&s;ed his gracious Providence that &s;he mu&s;t live and &s;uffer, that her rea&s;on might not prove a &s;acrifice to the agonies &s;he might be doomed to &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>Long and tediou&s;ly the hours rolled on: but at length the carriages came in &s;ight once more, and your unfortunate mother re&s;umed her concealed po&s;t. My phaeton accidentally &s;topping to allow a chariot to pa&s;s, &s;he heard more di&s;tinctly than before the merriment of the whole party, and perceived the criminal author of her mi&s;eries with a voice of plea&s;ure pointing out to his beautiful companion
<PB N="81" REF="85">
the romantic charms of the &s;urrounding pro&s;pect. The in&s;tant we were gone, &s;he be&s;ought one of my &s;ervants to take charge of her note: but this the fellow refu&s;ed, declaring with an oath that his Lord&s;hip was not to be troubled with petitions at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Wound up almo&s;t to a pitch of di&s;|traction, &s;he then followed me even to the gate of the ca&s;tle, her fears, or ra|ther her frenzy, having ari&s;en to a height that gave defiance to her apprehen&s;ion of being known, though &s;uch was her di&s;gui&s;e, that it mu&s;t have concealed her effectually. Unfortunately &s;he again en|countered the &s;ame inhuman footman, and again entreated him to deliver her letter; but her &s;olicitations only pro|duced &s;ome brutal jokes; and &s;he was about to crawl from the door, when the angui&s;h &s;he betrayed induced a maid &s;er|vant, who accidentally pa&s;&s;ed at that moment, to enquire into the cau&s;e of her
<PB N="82" REF="86">
di&s;tre&s;s; and who, reproving the foot|man's indelicacy, compa&s;&s;ionately under|took to take charge of it. The fellow pulling it from her hand, it was torn in pieces in the girl's &s;truggle to recover it; but delivering the fragments to your mother, &s;he faithfully engaged to pre|&s;ent any other &s;he &s;hould write. I &s;hall give it, &s;aid &s;he, to her Lady&s;hip's maid, who will deliver it into my Lord's own hands. What lady? cried the di&s;con&s;o|late Fanny. Why Lady Linro&s;e to be &s;ure, &s;aid the girl; my Lord's new-mar|ried lady.</P>
<P>Is then my Lord married? returned &s;he, in feeble accents.</P>
<P>Oh! &s;everal weeks ago, an&s;wered the other; who from her unea&s;ine&s;s, and the &s;ituation in which &s;he beheld her, began to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he was &s;ome poor deluded creature;&mdash;but his Lord&s;hip is very generous; and if he has injured
<PB N="83" REF="87">
you, he will make it up beyond your ex|pectation.</P>
<P>Though your mother's apprehen&s;ions had before almo&s;t amounted to certainty, yet to hear the truth pronounced be|yond a flattering po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, made her fall &s;en&s;ele&s;s into the arms of the humane girl, who in&s;tantly called &s;ome of the female &s;ervants to her a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; and when your mother opened her eyes, &s;he found her&s;elf in the hou&s;e|keeper's parlour, whither &s;he had been conveyed. On looking round, and per|ceiving her &s;ituation in the very room where every object was as familiar to her as if it had been her own apartment when &s;he re&s;ided in the ca&s;tle, the recol|lection of what &s;he had &s;uffered &s;ince that period wholly overpowered her; and to know her&s;elf &s;urrounded by my dome&s;|tics, and under the &s;ame roof with her hu&s;band, yet not daring to &s;olicit that &s;upport and protection from his care
<PB N="84" REF="88">
and tenderne&s;s, to which, particularly in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;he had &s;o ju&s;t a claim, &s;he found at that in&s;tant that &s;hame predominated in her bo&s;om even over de&s;pair; and terrified every in&s;tant le&s;t accident &s;hould pre&s;ent &s;ome of her old companions to her view, &s;he thanked her charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and made a fee|ble effort to ri&s;e as &s;oon as &s;he had &s;wal|lowed a few drops that had been given her.</P>
<P>The hou&s;ekeeper, however, in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould remain till &s;he was &s;ome|what more recovered; and a general &s;ym|pathy and curio&s;ity having been excited, &s;he was almo&s;t &s;tunned with interrogato|ries: but all &s;he could be prevailed on to acknowledge was, that &s;he brought a bill for Lord Linro&s;e to di&s;charge; and being liable to fits, had been &s;uddenly attacked with one ju&s;t as &s;he was deli|vering it to the maid.</P>
<P>Her too apparent di&s;tre&s;s, her he&s;ita|ting and embarra&s;&s;ed replies to many
<PB N="85" REF="89">
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing enquiries, and her tears, which now began to yield a mournful relief to agitations her utmo&s;t efforts could not conceal, made little credit be given to this a&s;&s;ertion; and the circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation could not fail to &s;ugge&s;t &s;u&s;picions of a nature the mo&s;t injurious: yet their compa&s;&s;ion left no room for con|tempt; and the good hou&s;ekeeper per|ceiving her &s;carce able to an&s;wer the flow of que&s;tions that poured in upon her from every quarter, had the human|ity to &s;end away all tho&s;e whom curi|o&s;ity had drawn round her, and promi&s;ed to deliver privately any letter &s;he &s;hould confide to her care.</P>
<P>Your unfortunate mother then de|parted with fatigued &s;teps from the ca&s;|tle, her mind torn by inward &s;truggles and di&s;traction, and her exhau&s;ted limbs unable to convey her farther, than to a cottage ju&s;t without the extremity of the park, who&s;e charitable owner allowed
<PB N="86" REF="90">
her under its roof to court that repo&s;e which fled equally from her eye lids and her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>She in&s;tantly enquired of the good woman if &s;he knew farmer Williams and his wife, and how they kept on in their old days? To this &s;he was an&s;wered, that they were in tolerable health; but that they had received a &s;hock &s;ome years before from the mi&s;conduct of an only and beloved daughter, which it &s;eemed too probable they never would recover.</P>
<P>My dear Fanny bur&s;t into an agony of grief at the&s;e words, which in&s;tantly infu&s;ed a &s;u&s;picion into the country wo|man that her gue&s;t was in fact the de|luded daughter of the farmer, who&s;e elopement had occa&s;ioned &s;uch various reports and conjectures among her re|lations. The &s;ituation in which &s;he be|held her, on the eve of bringing an in|fant into the world, confirmed this idea;
<PB N="87" REF="91">
yet though that circum&s;tance was but ill calculated to invalidate the unfavourable rumours circulated at her expence, the too evident di&s;tre&s;s &s;he endured made her appear &s;o ju&s;t an object of compa&s;&s;ion, that the woman proffered her every a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in her power: your unfortunate mother however, who&s;e only con&s;olation lay in the free indulgence of &s;orrow, having a&s;ked for pen, ink, and paper, which fortunately were to be had, re|que&s;ted to be left alone; and pa&s;&s;ed the night in tears, and in writing that me|lancholy letter, which &s;o pathetically implored my pity in&s;tead of breathing the vengeance due to my crimes.</P>
<P>It was yet unfini&s;hed; when finding her&s;elf taken violently ill, &s;he ha&s;tened to conclude it, and enquired for a me&s;|&s;enger, to whom &s;he intru&s;ted it under cover to the hou&s;e-keeper. Though not within &s;ome weeks of her expected time, fatigue and agitation &s;oon brought on
<PB N="88" REF="92">
the pangs of child birth; and having only received what a&s;&s;i&s;tance the country woman could be&s;tow, &s;he was delivered of a boy a few hours after, without one friend to &s;upport or con&s;ole her, at a period when the agonies of her mind &s;urpa&s;&s;ed what nature has allotted the fe|male frame to &s;u&s;tain in the&s;e &s;evere cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>No an&s;wer having been returned to her letter (owing to the cau&s;e I have al|ready mentioned) &s;he immediately con|cluded her&s;elf totally abandoned; and began mo&s;t fervently to hope &s;he &s;hould not long endure that accumulation of woes under which &s;he laboured: an un|common &s;en&s;ation of weakne&s;s, border|ing almo&s;t on a &s;tate of infancy, con|vinced her of her approaching di&s;&s;olution; and &s;he regarded her relea&s;e not only without di&s;may, but with eagerne&s;s and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation her mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h
<PB N="89" REF="93">
was to embrace her parents before her death; to explain whatever appeared criminal and unaccountable in her con|duct; and, having committed her chil|dren to their care, from whom alone &s;he now expected ju&s;tice and protection for them, to breathe her la&s;t &s;igh in their arms.</P>
<P>She therefore be&s;ought the country-woman to carry a me&s;&s;age to her father and mother, imploring them to deign to vi&s;it her before &s;he expired: to this woman &s;he likewi&s;e confe&s;&s;ed all the particulars of her unhappy &s;tory, and be&s;ought her to tell them, that could &s;he accu&s;e her&s;elf of one crime, excepting that of having de&s;erted them in their old age, for which &s;he hoped &s;he had been &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed, &s;he &s;hould not have dared to reque&s;t that &s;atisfaction, the only one &s;he would probably live to enjoy; and entreated them to believe, that the infant &s;he had ju&s;t brought into
<PB N="90" REF="94">
the world, owed its exi&s;tence to an event neither criminal nor di&s;graceful.</P>
<P>The old people, &s;tunned with this unexpected intelligence, knew not what to determine. They had long concluded their daughter lo&s;t and deluded; but their grief for her elopement was not unmixed with re&s;entment at her mi&s;|conduct. The circum&s;tances in which &s;he was re&s;tored to them, were far from arguing her innocence, and their fir&s;t re&s;olution was to abandon her to the fate they concluded &s;he had merited; but parental tenderne&s;s almo&s;t in&s;tantly converted this unnatural intention into the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;eeing her once more. To her prote&s;tations of purity, they gave little credit. But guilty as &s;he is, &s;aid the old man, &s;he is &s;till our child, and her pre&s;ent mi&s;ery obliterates her pa&s;t crimes:&mdash;mi&s;erable have been our days &s;ince her fall&mdash;the &s;ufferings are now become her own.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="95">Nature, however, pleaded &s;o power|fully for their daughter in the brea&s;ts of the good couple, that as they ha&s;tened to the cottage, they could not help indulging &s;ome faint hopes, that, though appearances were &s;o much again&s;t her, &s;ome alleviating circum&s;tances might turn out in her favour.</P>
<P>It may not then be difficult to imagine what mu&s;t have been their feelings, when, on being u&s;hered to the &s;ide of the bed where &s;he lay, their beloved child, unable to &s;ee them after a &s;epara|tion &s;o melancholy for almo&s;t &s;ix years, gave a feeble &s;hriek, and fainted away.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility &s;he con|tinued &s;o long that they gave her up for gone; but having &s;ent for a neighbouring &s;urgeon, who admini&s;tered every a&s;&s;i&s;|tance po&s;&s;ible, they had at length the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing her open her eyes once more. They immediately found, however, that though life was re&s;tored,
<PB N="92" REF="96">
it was not in human power to recover her from a violent delirium with which &s;he was in&s;tantly &s;eized. The doctor declared her in a high fever, which being attended with mortal &s;ymptoms, gave the mo&s;t alarming cau&s;e for appre|hending the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the unfortunate parents, who &s;aw them&s;elves on the point of lo&s;ing their daughter almo&s;t in the very in&s;tant that they had recovered her, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;cribed. She was perfectly in&s;en&s;ible to them and all about her, during the whole day; and raved with a frantic wildne&s;s which it was horrible to witne&s;s; often calling on my name and imploring my compa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t piteous manner. Her father having at one time approached her, the di&s;order of her imagination made her in&s;tantly conceive it to be the accur&s;ed author of all her mi&s;eries, and throwing her&s;elf &s;uddenly out of bed, in &s;pite of
<PB N="93" REF="97">
every oppo&s;ition, &s;he fell at his feet, imploring him not to murder her nor her infant: her angelic temper never once breathed an expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;ent|ment nor revenge, but her lips muttered uncea&s;ing complaints, and &s;he perpetually repeated, I am ju&s;t going to die, my Lord, wont that &s;atisfy you? Ah &s;pare my children!</P>
<P>The woman of the hou&s;e being unable to manage her, and her weeping parents totally di&s;abled by grief from a&s;&s;i&s;ting, &s;he was obliged to call in &s;ome of the neighbours, who could only con&s;train her by force to remain in bed.</P>
<P>Nature could not long &s;u&s;tain a conflict &s;o violent; nor can I, my children, force my&s;elf to dwell upon a &s;cene, the idea of which inflicts unmitigated torture.</P>
<P>A few hours wore entirely out what little &s;trength remained; and after having lain &s;ome time quiet, her &s;en&s;es were re&s;tored to her. She recollected the
<PB N="94" REF="98">
me&s;&s;age &s;he had di&s;patched to her parents, and enquired compo&s;edly, tho' with a voice almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, what an&s;wer had been delivered.</P>
<P>They, who were no farther than at the foot of the bed, could not any longer re|&s;train them&s;elves from ru&s;hing into her arms, and embracing her as &s;he lay. Their tears prevented them from articulating; but their daughter, who approached her la&s;t hour, was too feeble even to weep.</P>
<P>Oh, my beloved parents! cried &s;he, with a hollow voice, which her breathing often rendered interrupted, I &s;hall now die contented, &s;ince I have the &s;ati&s;|faction of expiring in your arms. I hope God will forgive my undutiful conduct towards you. Alas! you &s;ee how I have &s;uffered for it. But I hope &mdash;may I tru&s;t you never could believe that I had thrown a &s;tain on the virtuous education I received from your care. Indeed&mdash;indeed&mdash;I am innocent, and
<PB N="95" REF="99">
really married. My a&s;&s;erting it at a moment &s;o &s;olemn, ought alone to con|vince you of the truth of this a&s;&s;urance; but, if more is nece&s;&s;ary, I am in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the mo&s;t certain and convincing proofs.</P>
<P>She then ordered the country-woman to deliver to her parents a packet which &s;he had &s;ealed, and committed to her charge, on being fir&s;t taken ill: it con|tained the certificate of our marriage, and &s;everal letters written and &s;igned by my own hand, which plainly proved that I regarded her as my wife.</P>
<P>I tru&s;ted him becau&s;e I loved him, continued &s;he; but in &s;pite of the &s;tricte&s;t ties, you &s;ee he has abandoned and de|&s;erted me, and I am going to atone with my life for the angui&s;h my ra&s;h &s;tep mu&s;t have given you in your old days. Indeed the idea of your unea&s;ine&s;s wholly embittered any &s;hort gleams of comfort I might otherwi&s;e have enjoyed;
<PB N="96" REF="100">
and tran&s;ient indeed have the&s;e been &s;ince I left you. The only circum&s;tance which yielded me any con&s;olation in all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, was the delightful hope, that the day would come when I &s;hould exultingly reveal all to you, and recom|pence you and my&s;elf by making the old age of my beloved father and mother affluent and happy.</P>
<P>That day, repeated &s;he, after a pau&s;e, will never arrive; and perhaps it is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment from Heaven for having de&s;erted you; in which ca&s;e, as my repentance is mo&s;t &s;incere for that and all my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, I tru&s;t in God it will be graciou&s;ly accepted, and that I &s;hall find in the grave that peace to which my bo&s;om has been &s;o long a &s;tranger. But oh, my deare&s;t father and mother, all my fears are for you; to me, death is a relea&s;e from mi&s;ery; &s;ince I retain no longer the affections of Lord Linro&s;e, I pre&s;erve nothing that
<PB N="97" REF="101">
attaches me to life. I feel, indeed, for my three infants, but while my mother &s;urvives, I am certain they will never know the lo&s;s of their own; and I hope they will neither inherit my weakne&s;&s;es nor my misfortunes. Oh, may it plea&s;e the Almighty to deliver them from im|bibing one particle of their cruel father's hardne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>The old people folded her alternately in their arms, and mingling tears with their ble&s;&s;ings, a&s;&s;ured her of their perfect forgivene&s;s, and entreated her to live for their con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Oh! my deare&s;t parents! cried &s;he, how can you wi&s;h me &s;o ill! di&s;tract me not, I be&s;eech you, with your de&s;pair! God knows if I am really &s;o near my end as I imagine, but I feel my&s;elf in|wardly gone, and &s;o exhau&s;ted, that I think the &s;truggle mu&s;t &s;oon be over. She then recapitulated the melancholy circum&s;tances of her misfortunes as well
<PB N="98" REF="102">
as weakne&s;s would allow her; but having wholly exhau&s;ted her&s;elf, &s;he mentioned being extremely drow&s;y, and ki&s;&s;ing her infant, perhaps it may be for the la&s;t time, &s;aid &s;he; do not quit my bed&s;ide, my deare&s;t mother, while I &s;leep; and &s;tretching forth her hand, already be|dewed with the damp of death, &s;he gra&s;ped her mother's with a feeble effort, and recommending her&s;elf to Heaven, in that attitude compo&s;ed her&s;elf to a repo&s;e from which &s;he never awoke. Her &s;leep, at fir&s;t agitated and di&s;turbed, &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided into a lethargic &s;tupor, and &s;he expired at midnight without a &s;igh.</P>
<P>Think, my children, what this recital co&s;ts me. It is wor&s;e than death to write! To think on &s;uch a &s;cene&mdash;to think&mdash;God of Heaven! that I was the accur&s;ed murderer of that &s;uffering angel! that my hands dealt the fatal blow which &s;tabbed her to the heart!</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="103">Oh! my daughters! be not over|powered with horror. Let not, at lea&s;t, a compa&s;&s;ion too ju&s;t for your haple&s;s mother's fate, wholly obliterate from your bo&s;oms that regard which your father has hitherto enjoyed. The be|nignant &s;aint, I tru&s;t, accepts the tribute of that bitter remor&s;e which has clouded the remainder of my days, and now re|joices in that ble&s;&s;ed reward which her merit and her calamities &s;o ju&s;tly claim in a more glorious &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I now ha&s;ten to conclude the horrid tale; and return to my&s;elf, on that dreadful evening when your mother's letter was put into my hands.</P>
<P>Her &s;ufferings, unutterable as they proved, being unimbittered with the agonizing pangs of remor&s;e, could hardly &s;urpa&s;s mine during that mi&s;erable night. My feelings were, if po&s;&s;ible, heightened by the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of concealing what I endured, under a &s;miling counte|nance;
<PB N="100" REF="104">
this, however, I could only hope to effect by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of wine, which I poured down in quantities, in hopes of drowning care and &s;tifling con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>To augment my di&s;tre&s;s, which in|toxication, without bereaving me of my &s;en&s;es, could but little allay, on returning to the company, I found them in all the enjoyment of mirth and innocence. The mu&s;ic had been conveyed from the lawn to the &s;aloon; and the moment I ap|peared, I was &s;olicited to join the dance. Too con&s;cious to refu&s;e, I was con|&s;trained to cover my angui&s;h by a&s;&s;uming an air of gaiety, the mo&s;t forced and unnatural. Happily the company were too much engro&s;&s;ed with them&s;elves, and the amu&s;ement in which they were engaged, to ob&s;erve me; but the dance being ended, Lady Linro&s;e, my beloved Lady Linro&s;e approached me.</P>
<P>She enquired in a tender whi&s;per,
<PB N="101" REF="105">
why I had &s;o long &s;ecluded my&s;elf from the company, and expre&s;&s;ed her fears le&s;t I was ill; for which apprehen&s;ion my pallid look, and an agitation not to be di&s;gui&s;ed, gave but too much cau&s;e. I an&s;wered her, as compo&s;edly as I could, that I had a &s;evere head-ach, which dancing had encrea&s;ed. She then be&s;ought me, with an anxiety that &s;tabbed me to the &s;oul, to fatigue my&s;elf no more: and carele&s;sly repeating that it was a complaint to which I had been liable from my infancy, I turned from her the moment I could do &s;o without appearing abrupt.</P>
<P>Good heavens! cried I to my&s;elf, into what a gulph of mi&s;ery have my ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions plunged me! And what would your &s;ufferings be, mo&s;t amiable, mo&s;t beloved of women! did you know the injury I have done you. Were the fatal tale to reach your ears, how would your pre&s;ent tenderne&s;s in|&s;tantly
<PB N="102" REF="106">
be converted into contempt and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>The&s;e tormenting ideas made me avoid her the whole evening: and I dreaded the hour of retirement, le&s;t, when we were alone, &s;he &s;hould ob&s;erve my di&s;tre&s;s, and renew her enquiries. My pretence of illne&s;s, however, was ea&s;ily admitted by her un&s;u&s;pecting mind; and I pretended to &s;leep, while my feel|ings were in a &s;tate which would admit of nothing like repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Next morning a party on hor&s;eback was propo&s;ed, and agreed to by all but my&s;elf. I excu&s;ed my&s;elf on account of bu&s;ine&s;s; intending to take that oppor|tunity to get rid of my friends, and perform my promi&s;ed vi&s;it to your mother, &s;evere as was the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I knew not exactly the cottage in which &s;he had taken up her abode; but concluding it would not be difficult to
<PB N="103" REF="107">
find, I re&s;olved to begin the &s;earch as &s;oon as the company were &s;et out.</P>
<P>One of the ladies, who was extremely gay, importuned me with eagerne&s;s during breakfa&s;t to po&s;tpone my bu&s;ine&s;s for at lea&s;t one half hour, and accom|pany her with one or two more of my friends in a walk to the extremity of the park, to give my opinion of a &s;ituation for a ru&s;tic temple, which &s;he had ad|vi&s;ed my Lord to erect on a particular &s;pot beyond the park gate; after which they meant to join the re&s;t of the party, and pur&s;ue their morning rambles to|gether.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious guilt made me agree to the propo&s;al, as I &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould be &s;oon afterwards at liberty; and I accordingly followed the young lady and my father, attended by Mr. Ben&s;eley, who was the friend to whom I was mo&s;t tenderly attached, and indeed the one who mo&s;t merited my confidence and friend&s;hip,
<PB N="104" REF="108">
and accompanied by my dear Lady Lin|ro&s;e, who hung on my arm as we walked along, vainly endeavouring by the &s;oft|ne&s;s of her attentions to &s;oothe an un|ea&s;ine&s;s, the cau&s;e of which &s;he could not penetrate.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we got out of the park, we ob&s;erved a good looking young woman, who &s;uckled an infant, at the door of a cottage which &s;tood directly on the road &s;ide.</P>
<P>That little thing appears hardly out of the egg &s;hell, &s;aid Lady Linro&s;e in pa&s;&s;ing. How comes it, good woman, that you expo&s;e it to the air &s;o early?</P>
<P>Indeed madam, replied the woman, becau&s;e it breaks my heart to enter the hou&s;e. The mother of this child expired this morning; and her old father and mother are at this moment lamenting over the body in &s;o piteous a manner, that it would melt a heart of &s;tone to witne&s;s their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="109">The&s;e words made me &s;hudder with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions. But I was endeavouring to per&s;uade the ladies, who were greatly intere&s;ted by this mournful tale, to walk on, pre|tending great ha&s;te, when a figure pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to our view, which in&s;tantly arre&s;ted their &s;teps and rendered me mo|tionle&s;s with horror.&mdash;It was the old man him&s;elf, the father of your mother; who having perceived me from the win|dow of the cottage, in the frenzy of his de&s;pair, ru&s;hed out upon us. His aged withered face was pale with grief, and his whole frame &s;hook with rage. Ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in&s;tantly to me&mdash;Come in here, dete&s;ted wretch! cried he; come in here, and contemplate your work: &s;ee here the fruits of your villainy in the de&s;truction of my darling child, your true and lawful wife; who lies here &s;acrificed by your treachery, and murdered by your own hands.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="110">I heard no more: but uttering an exclamation of horror, fell in&s;en&s;ible on the ground. Lady Linro&s;e, &s;hrieking with terror, threw her&s;elf by my &s;ide to &s;upport me, and Ben&s;eley, who was more able for the ta&s;k, held me in his arms as I lay.</P>
<P>I almo&s;t in&s;tantly recovered my &s;en&s;es: but unable to &s;tand the horrid explana|tion which I knew mu&s;t follow; unable at that moment, when the keene&s;t re|mor&s;e began to pierce my bo&s;om and wholly unfitted me for di&s;&s;imulation, to vindicate my innocence or even to at|tempt the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of defence, while the old man's a&s;&s;ertion was too &s;trongly corroborated by the effects it had produced, I kept my eyes &s;till &s;hut, and pretended to remain in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;i|bility.</P>
<P>My father &s;tood in mute a&s;toni&s;hment at this &s;cene, too much confounded to unravel what it meant. The farmer's
<PB N="107" REF="111">
frantic violence he might have conceived to be the &s;udden con&s;equences of in|&s;anity; but the &s;ituation into which his words had thrown me, gave no &s;mall de|gree of credebility to what he had ut|tered, wild and extravagant as were his expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>What does all this mean? cried he to the farmer.</P>
<P>It means, returned the old man, that your &s;on, my Lord, is a villain! yes, a perjured villain! He has married ano|ther, when my daughter has been law|fully his wife above &s;ix years, and &s;he this morning expired a victim to his cruelty and crimes.</P>
<P>Oh horrible! exclaimed Lady, Lin|ro&s;e; abominable wretch! how, my Lord, can you tamely &s;ubmit to hear that frantic old man utter fal&s;hoods &s;o infa|mous and impo&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>Infamous it is, cried the farmer; would to heaven it had al&s;o been impo&s;&s;i|ble:
<PB N="108" REF="112">
then had I at this in&s;tant rejoiced over a long lo&s;t and adored child, in&s;tead of mourning her mi&s;erable end in tears and di&s;traction. Oh my Lord! conti|nued the old man, &s;ubdued by grief, which now &s;ucceeded to rage and indig|nation, throwing him&s;elf on his knees at my father's feet, from your character I dare hope for ju&s;tice: you &s;hall &s;peedily be convinced that my innocent child has been deluded in the mo&s;t &s;hameful man|ner; and mean as is our rank, her fame mu&s;t and &s;hall be vindicated.</P>
<P>He then pre&s;ented a paper to my fa|ther, which he entreated him to peru&s;e. It was the certificate of my marriage with your mother; and my Lord, who by this time began to be &s;omewhat &s;taggered, appeared infinitely &s;hocked on ha&s;tily throwing his eyes over the contents.</P>
<P>Farmer, &s;aid he, he&s;itating, and in much agitation, I believe my &s;on may have injured your daughter; in which
<PB N="109" REF="113">
ca&s;e all the reparation &s;he could have claimed, or you now can a&s;k, &s;hall be granted you; but as to his having made her his wife, that is an a&s;&s;ertion which &s;he has evidently invented to &s;ave her credit with you after her fall, and the fal&s;hood of &s;uch a pretence is enough to per&s;uade you that &s;he has not been with|out her &s;hare of the guilt. My &s;on is, as you &s;ee, &s;ufficiently affected with the unfortunate cata&s;trophe, and I am very far from vindicating his conduct; on the contrary, all that can now be done to appea&s;e and con&s;ole you is undoubtedly his duty; but in what manner this is to be effected, we mu&s;t afterwards con&s;ider. I &s;hall take another opportunity of talking with you on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Come, Madam, &s;aid he to Lady Lin|ro&s;e, who, breathle&s;s with apprehen&s;ion, had remained during this conver&s;ation in all the &s;tupor of &s;ilent horror. Pray lean on my arm, and let us be gone from
<PB N="110" REF="114">
this place. Let us leave my &s;on to the care of his friend. He is in no &s;ituation to ju&s;tify him&s;elf at pre&s;ent. We ought therefore to &s;u&s;pend our opinion of his behaviour till he can explain matters fully. <HI>All</HI> that he is accu&s;ed of is ut|terly impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Young men, even the very be&s;t of them, continued he, as he obliged her unwillingly to walk away, &s;upported by his arm and accompanied by her compa|nion, are but too prone to vices which in the more advanced periods of their lives they reflect on with regret and remor&s;e. As to the ridiculous &s;tory of the mar|riage, I hope it gives you not the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I cannot leave him thus, cried Lady Linro&s;e, who&s;e voice now bur&s;t through the &s;obs and tears which had &s;topped her utterance. But my Lord urged her &s;trongly; and her friend &s;o earne&s;tly be|&s;ought her to leave me to Ben&s;eley's care,
<PB N="111" REF="115">
that &s;he at la&s;t unwillingly attempted to go, though &s;he often reverted her eyes, and was yet in &s;ight, though at &s;ome di&s;tance, when Ben&s;eley &s;aw her drop on the ground.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the ladies departed with my father, I opened my eyes. The far|mer darted a look of enraged indignation at me, and walked &s;orrowfully into the cottage almo&s;t immediately; before the door of which this dreadful &s;cene had been tran&s;acted, and into which the wo|man and child had retreated at the be|ginning; though I perceived that &s;he had brought more than one face to the window to remark the con&s;ternation into which the company had been thrown.</P>
<P>Only my friend Ben&s;eley therefore re|mained; and even him I dreaded to look on, though he laboured to &s;oothe me with words of comfort. Oh, Ben&s;eley! cried I, as &s;oon as I could find courage to &s;peak, lead me from this &s;pot, where
<PB N="112" REF="116">
every object conveys horror inexpre&s;&s;i|ble! I will explain all to you hereafter; but at pre&s;ent my mind is incapable of talking, thinking, or acting for my&s;elf!</P>
<P>Would you return to the ca&s;tle? cried he.</P>
<P>Oh! God! any where but to the ca&s;tle. Hide me for ever from all be|neath its roof, and mo&s;t from my amia|ble, my injured&mdash;</P>
<P>I dared not add, <HI>wife</HI>: my lips at that moment of angui&s;h refu&s;ed to be|&s;tow that appellation, except on the &s;till more injured decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;upported my&s;elf on my friend's arm, and &s;hame &s;upplying the place of &s;trength, we were &s;oon out of &s;ight of the cottage, and of Lady Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>Tell me, cried Ben&s;eley, as we walked &s;lowly on, tell me I entreat you, what all this means? I confound my&s;elf in vain to unravel the my&s;tery. What am I to think of the &s;ituation in which I &s;ee
<PB N="113" REF="117">
you? I perceive you accu&s;e your&s;elf of the poor girl's death. But country girls don't break their hearts from having made a fal&s;e &s;tep; and it may have been with much more probability merely ow|ing to the circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation; in which ca&s;e, though you have certainly rea&s;on to reproach your&s;elf, if &s;he was innocent and &s;educed, yet there may be many alleviating circum&s;tances to recon|cile you to your&s;elf, and to excu&s;e you even in the eyes of Lady Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>Oh Ben&s;eley! mention not her name! (covering my face with my hands as if terrified at the idea of beholding her.)</P>
<P>Good heavens! my Lord, what do you mean?</P>
<P>I mean, that &s;he has not, and <HI>never, never</HI> could have had a title to that name.</P>
<P>God in heaven! what do you tell me? exclaimed he in horror. What is it you force me to &s;u&s;pect?</P>
<P>Talk not on this &s;ubject, cried I; I
<PB N="114" REF="118">
am unable to bear it. Would to God that the earth could open under my feet and &s;wallow within its bowels a wretch unworthy to crawl on its &s;urface.</P>
<P>For heaven's &s;ake endeavour to com|po&s;e your&s;elf, my dear Linro&s;e, cried he. But where do you intend going?</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, to town; where I could more ea&s;ily bury my&s;elf from the world, and hide my head from every eye that had a chance of recognizing me.</P>
<P>Ben&s;eley then entreated me to mode|rate the tran&s;ports of my de&s;pair, and to walk forward towards a village, where hor&s;es could be provided. This he could not for &s;ome time prevail on me to at|tempt; but at la&s;t, the de&s;ire of &s;ecluding my&s;elf induced me to wi&s;h to be in Lon|don as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and we made the mo&s;t of our way till we approached near the village. My friend, tho' afraid to leave me by my&s;elf in that &s;ituation of mind, after vainly &s;triving to calm the
<PB N="115" REF="119">
tumults of my di&s;traction, and receiving my &s;olemn promi&s;e to attempt no act of violence in his ab&s;ence, then departed to provide a po&s;t chai&s;e from the inn. I confe&s;s that had not my oath withheld my arm when I was left alone, I was hardly enough ma&s;ter of my&s;elf to have re&s;i&s;ted the temptation of putting a pe|riod to my exi&s;tence; but Ben&s;eley, who dreaded the wildne&s;s of my de&s;pair, ha&s;|tened the execution of his orders, and &s;oon returned to me in the carriage.</P>
<P>We travelled po&s;t, for my friend would not de&s;ert me in that moment of affliction, and procured lodgings the mo&s;t private in an ob&s;cure part of the city. In&s;tead of upbraiding me, he performed uncea&s;ingly the kinde&s;t offices of friend|&s;hip; and perceiving me &s;ufficiently pe|netrated with a &s;en&s;e of the criminality and weakne&s;s of my conduct, and en|tirely overpowered by the calamities which had re&s;ulted from it, not to my|&s;elf
<PB N="116" REF="120">
alone, but to tho&s;e I pa&s;&s;ionately loved, and indeed to all who were con|nected with me, he not only forbore to probe my wounds too &s;everely, but ex|erted him&s;elf to plan what &s;teps I ought next to pur&s;ue; and I, who was unable to think for my&s;elf, received a feeble ray of &s;atisfaction on finding I &s;till po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a friend who would not abandon me, and that my crimes had not made this earth completely a de&s;ert to me.</P>
<P>Immediately on my arrival, I was &s;eized with a violent fever attended with a delirium, in the intervals of which I heartily wi&s;hed the di&s;ea&s;e might prove the termination of all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es. My friend, who never quitted my bed &s;ide, on this occa&s;ion wrote, by my de&s;ire, a letter to my father, acquainting him with my &s;ituation, and confe&s;&s;ing to him every circum&s;tance of my mi&s;conduct. This I had no intention now of concealing; and a full confe&s;&s;ion of the truth, in my
<PB N="117" REF="121">
&s;ituation, was the only virtue I could te&s;tify. Ben&s;eley informed him, that unable to &s;hew my face to the world, or again to meet the eyes of the woman I had &s;o unpardonably, &s;o irreparably in|jured, from the violence of a pa&s;&s;ion which knew no bounds and would give way to no re&s;traints, and &s;en&s;ible that I merited only &s;corn and abhorrence from her, I was firmly determined, &s;hould I recover, which was an event he well knew I heartily wi&s;hed never might take place, to &s;pend the remainder of my days in a foreign country, and to bury my&s;elf in &s;olitude and ob&s;curity, where my name &s;hould be unheard of and my crimes unknown.</P>
<P>To this my father returned an an&s;wer dictated by all that re&s;entment I had &s;o ju&s;tly incurred. He de&s;ired Ben&s;eley to inform me, that my offences were of a nature that reflected not only infamy on my&s;elf but di&s;grace and contamination
<PB N="118" REF="122">
on all who had the misfortune of being allied to me: that he had endeavoured all in his power, not from regard to my fate but from anxiety to pre&s;erve the fa|mily honour untarni&s;hed, to per&s;uade the farmer and his wife to &s;ilence, in hopes that the horrid train of iniquity which had led to &s;uch calamities, might be at lea&s;t in part a &s;ecret from the world: but the old people, above be|ing either bribed or &s;oothed into this mea&s;ure, held their determination unal|terable of vindicating the injured fame of their decea&s;ed daughter, and were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ufficient evidence to prove the truth of that unmanly and dete&s;table tran&s;action: that for his part, he could not help approving their inflexibility, and was not even certain if he was ju&s;ti|fiable in having attempted to &s;kreen a wretch, though his own &s;on, from the a&s;&s;ured con&s;equences of bla&s;ted and irre|trievable honour, which ever receives
<PB N="119" REF="123">
its due puni&s;hment in the contempt, ab|horrence, and de&s;ertion of the world; and which being driven from &s;ociety and &s;hunned by mankind, is forced to hide its mi&s;erable head in ob&s;curity, where not one ray of comfort alleviates the ju&s;t though rigorous &s;entence.</P>
<P>Happy had it been, continued his Lord&s;hip, for his whole family, had he breathed his la&s;t ere he ca&s;t &s;o foul a &s;tain on all connected with him. As to his pre&s;ent illne&s;s, all that can be wi&s;hed for by his unfortunate relations is, that time may be granted him to repent of the many evils into which his mi&s;conduct has involved them and him&s;elf. He next mentioned Lady Linro&s;e. My dear Lady Linro&s;e! At the &s;ound of her name I &s;huddered. Let me know no further, cried I to Ben&s;eley, whom I had con|&s;trained unwillingly to read aloud the letter to me: yet the next moment my anxiety being in&s;upportable, I in&s;i&s;ted on
<PB N="120" REF="124">
hearing all. She had been violently ill, had been given over by her phy&s;icians, and was &s;till in the mo&s;t alarming &s;itua|tion, though for the pre&s;ent the fever ap|peared to have given way to medicine. But what was even ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than this, and rendered me ab&s;o|lutely frantic with de&s;pair, her mind no le&s;s than her tender frame had &s;uffered. She never had been her&s;elf &s;ince that fa|tal, that accur&s;ed day. If the wretch, &s;aid my father in his letter, is in&s;en&s;ible to the many &s;hocking calamities which his crimes have produced, you may add to the li&s;t that of having driven to mad|ne&s;s the lovelie&s;t and mo&s;t amiable of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>In the &s;tate I then was, it may ea&s;ily be concluded that a &s;evere relap&s;e could not fail to be the con&s;equence of this dreadful information; and it was more than once my intention to put a final pe|riod to my exi&s;tence by my own hand;

but Heaven interpo&s;ed to &s;ave me from an action which would have filled up the mea&s;ure of my iniquities, and my friend at length brought me to a more tempe|rate frame of mind.</P>
<P>During this period, an old &s;ervant, who is &s;ince dead, whom I had ever con|&s;idered more on the footing of a friend than a dome&s;tic, as he had once known better days, and had attended me from my youth, contrived, by what means I know not, to di&s;cover the place of my concealment. He had been left with the re&s;t of my attendants at the Ca&s;tle: but on hearing of my mi&s;conduct, ea&s;ily conjecturing my &s;ituation, his faithful attachment determined him to find me out, and to entreat my acceptance of his attendance in whatever part of the globe I &s;hould fix my re&s;idence. He had in &s;ome particular in&s;tances regarded him|&s;elf as under peculiar obligations to me; and with a gratitude and fidelity rarely
<PB N="122" REF="126">
to be met with in higher and more re|fined &s;pheres, re&s;olved to attach him&s;elf to me. By his means I learnt every mi|nute circum&s;tance of the death of your mother, and all the particulars which preceded that di&s;mal event. He had gained his intelligence from the woman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the cottage; and an&s;wered my interrogatories with an accuracy which I never &s;hould have received from other hands, and which mu&s;t have augmented my de&s;pair, had that been po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was able to rea&s;on or re|flect with any &s;ort of compo&s;ure, Ben&s;e|ley brought you, my beloved children, to me, which was indeed the only &s;hape which comfort could have a&s;&s;umed to touch my heart. The &s;ight of my Her|mione, who&s;e countenance recalled her injured mother &s;trongly to my mind, and in who&s;e infant features the expre&s;&s;ion of her mother's &s;weetne&s;s and her virtues were &s;trikingly marked, brought the
<PB N="123" REF="127">
&s;oothing relief of tears, the fir&s;t that de|&s;pair had permitted to flow; and the only idea which afforded any thing like &s;atisfaction to my &s;oul, was the re&s;olution of retiring abroad with my children, and devoting the re&s;t of my life to their edu|cation; to fortify their minds with &s;uch principles as might deter them from guilt and deliver them from calamities like their father's. This employment I con|&s;idered as the only &s;atisfaction I could offer to the memory of your unfortunate mother, and I flatter my&s;elf that if &s;he could look down, it would give her an|gelic mind plea&s;ure even in paradi&s;e, to behold me in&s;tilling into the minds of her children, &s;entiments congenial with her own.</P>
<P>This determination my father ap|proved, and informed Ben&s;eley, who acted as agent between us, that he would &s;ettle an annual pen&s;ion upon me, for which I was to &s;ign a formal re&s;ignation
<PB N="124" REF="128">
of all claims to what might have de|volved to me at his death, and which would &s;pare him the mortification of dreading any litigation in future between me and my brother, who on this di&s;mal event had been rein&s;tated in his Lord|&s;hip's favour, and with his wife and a numerous family, were recalled from Ireland, the place of his con&s;tant re&s;i|dence ever &s;ince his limited finances had con&s;trained him to leave the army.</P>
<P>I &s;tipulated, in place of the pen&s;ion, for twenty thou&s;and pounds; which &s;um was placed in the funds, and the annual intere&s;t has been remitted to me by Ben&s;e|ley &s;ince my re&s;idence here, with all the zeal of &s;incere friend&s;hip. Through his means I made enquiry al&s;o about my little infant boy, who&s;e birth had been marked by events &s;o dreadful; and had the misfortune to learn that he &s;urvived not above a fortnight, and the old peo|ple mourned their daughter's death once
<PB N="125" REF="129">
more in the lo&s;s of the child &s;he had be|queathed to their care.</P>
<P>To that mi&s;erable old couple, who&s;e days I had loaded with unmitigated &s;or|row, I remitted every year a certain &s;um, by unknown hands, being con&s;cious that from the hated hands of the murderer of their child, they never would have ac|cepted the gift. But within five years after my departure, Ben&s;eley informed me that the pen&s;ion was no longer nece&s;|&s;ary; a fever having carried off the old man in his &s;eventieth year, and his wife followed him a few months after.</P>
<P>My melancholy relation now draws towards a conclu&s;ion; for as &s;oon as my illne&s;s would admit of a removal, I bid adieu to England for ever. It was not, you may ea&s;ily conceive, my children, without feelings un&s;peakably painful, that I departed; nor without a tear which wrung my heart, that I was &s;eparated from Ben&s;eley. Though tenderly at|tached
<PB N="126" REF="130">
to you both, the only ties which connected me with mankind, you were but in infancy; and your innocent prat|ling, intere&s;ting as it was to the partial ears of a father, could yet but ill &s;upply the &s;ociety of a friend tried and approved. With a mind &s;o unfitted for reflection, my &s;olitude mu&s;t at fir&s;t have been in&s;up|portable, had I not regarded every pang I endured as a ju&s;t penance for offences hardly to be expected, and never to be forgotten.</P>
<P>Submi&s;&s;ion to Heaven, and a proper &s;en&s;e of that religion which leads even the greate&s;t criminals to tru&s;t for pardon if penitent, has &s;upported me, and my &s;uf|ferings have now &s;ub&s;ided into a &s;ettled melancholy; which at times has even &s;omething not unplea&s;ing in it, and which admits of all the rational comforts of life, in the enjoyment of the &s;ociety of my children, and even a delight in contemplating the &s;ucce&s;s of my labours
<PB N="127" REF="131">
for their improvement. But the&s;e &s;ati&s;|factions mu&s;t ever be mixed with that allay which remembrance mingles with every ri&s;ing con&s;olation. This temper renders my company little amu&s;ing to tho&s;e whom accident has introduced to my acquaintance, and on the other hand wholly unfits me for intercour&s;e with the world; &s;o that I have continued to live from choice in a retirement which has been only once enlivened by a kind vi&s;it of &s;ome months from my dear Ben&s;eley, and within the&s;e two years by the agreea|ble &s;ociety of my friend Mr. Howard, who&s;e acquaintance and friend&s;hip I re|gard as a &s;ignal favour from heaven to &s;oothe and con&s;ole me. He has indeed beguiled many a lonely hour by the mild good &s;en&s;e of his conver&s;ation&mdash;hours which otherwi&s;e would have proved di&s;|mal and irk&s;ome; for where reflection gives no comfort, time fails of its u&s;ual power of lulling pain.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="132">Immediately on my departure, I a&s;|&s;umed the name of Seymour, that no trace might remain to lead any of my former acquaintance to the knowledge of my abode. Even the good woman Mrs. Benton, whom Ben&s;eley procured to take charge of you as governe&s;s, knew me but under that borrowed appearance, and was ignorant to her death of the truth. That event, which happened &s;ome years after I &s;ettled at B&mdash;, obliged me unwillingly to &s;end you to the convent of &mdash; for further in|&s;truction in the different branches of education, in&s;tead of &s;upplying her lo&s;s by another tutore&s;s in the &s;ame line; for though this might have been perhaps procured, I knew not where to apply: Ben&s;eley was not at that time in a &s;ituation, from various circum&s;tances, to exert him&s;elf in finding a per&s;on properly qualified, and he was the only one on
<PB N="129" REF="133">
whom I could rely in a matter of &s;uch infinite moment.</P>
<P>I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to deprive either of you of the little accom|pli&s;hments of your &s;ex; the principal advantages re&s;ulting from which are the amu&s;ement they be&s;tow in &s;olitude; neither did I con&s;ider it as allowable to &s;eclude you from forming tho&s;e &s;oft ties and delightful connections of friend&s;hip, with girls of your own age, which are the growth of that happy period of our lives and almo&s;t belong &s;olely to it; while on the other hand, be&s;ides parting from you for &s;o long a &s;pace of time, I was under great apprehen&s;ions le&s;t your infant minds &s;hould be tinged, during your abode in the mona&s;try, with the errors of the catholic per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>I determined, however, to place you there for two years, and I ble&s;s Heaven I have had rea&s;on in no re&s;pect to regret the &s;acrifice I made for Hermione's im|provements,

<P>I am now come to the conclu&s;ion of my painful recital.

I do not wi&s;h you to excu&s;e my conduct: do not attempt it; for of none will it admit. Abhor my crimes; but try to di&s;tingui&s;h your father from his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and pre&s;erve if po&s;&s;ible for my memory, that unabated tenderne&s;s and duty which have con&s;tituted the &s;ole con&s;olation of a life worn out with remor&s;e, and de|voted to repentance&mdash;a repentance, the &s;incerity of which Heaven, I tru&s;t, has accepted.</P>
<P>Should the Almighty take me to him&s;elf before you have engaged your|&s;elves

protectors in the married &s;tate, my friend Ben&s;eley has faithfully engaged to be a &s;econd parent to you: to him, therefore, I bequeath you; and I de&s;ire that you may ever regard him as my &s;ucce&s;&s;or in your obedience and affections. On him you may &s;afely rely, who would have &s;aved your father from de&s;truction had he profited from his example, and who &s;aved him from de&s;pair though he &s;lighted and neglected it.

<HEAD>LETTER II. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SEPT. 26, &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your kind letter, my beloved friend; the mo&s;t agreeable circum&s;tance that could have befallen me at pre&s;ent, when my heart, exhau&s;ted and depre&s;&s;ed, can imbibe con&s;olation or relief from the tender &s;ympathy of friend&s;hip alone.</P>
<P>How ju&s;t are your reflections, my Sophia, on our dear father's unhappy &s;tory. Surely a &s;en&s;e &s;o rigorous of his errors, and &s;o many years devoted to penitence and remor&s;e, mu&s;t not only have entirely obliterated his faults in the
<PB N="134" REF="138">
eyes of infinite ju&s;tice and mercy, but ought to render every candid mind compa&s;&s;ionate and indulgent to tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions which conveyed &s;o &s;everely their own puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>What a number of circum&s;tances, unheeded at the time, do Fanny and I now recall, that prove how bitterly he &s;uffered. The gravity and &s;eeming au&s;terity of his manners, which you u&s;ed to &s;ay made him appear &s;o awful that you never could feel at ea&s;e in his pre|&s;ence, we concluded merely con&s;titu|tional: alas! we &s;u&s;pected not that his melancholy had a &s;ource &s;o deep, nor that a weight of painful recollections gave a heavine&s;s to his heart, which de|prived every enjoyment of its true reli&s;h, and could not fail to throw a gloom over his whole appearance; e&s;pecially in the eyes of my gay, animated Sophia, ble&s;&s;ed with a mind at ea&s;e, and in po&s;&s;e&s;ion of
<PB N="135" REF="139">
all the vivacity which youth, health, and lively &s;pirits can produce.</P>
<P>Yet, my dear, religion and re&s;ignation had effected in him a mild thought|fulne&s;s, which, while it repre&s;&s;ed gaiety, was far from wholly precluding content|ment. His temper was indeed &s;o &s;erene, &s;o amiable, &s;o free from all caprice or ill humour, and his conver&s;ation &s;o in|&s;tructively amu&s;ing, &s;o complai&s;antly in|dulgent to all the little whims and wi&s;hes of his children, that our affection for him, warm and unbounded, was un|tinctured with dread or awe; and we ever regarded him in the light of an agreeable and entertaining companion, while we revered him as that of a con|de&s;cending and re&s;pectable parent.</P>
<P>Has not the woeful tale drawn tears from you, my dear? As for Fanny and my&s;elf, I thought the peru&s;al would have actually killed us. Oh! what a number of dreadful events, un&s;u&s;pected and un|known,
<PB N="136" REF="140">
what a &s;ource of never cea&s;ing regret, has it opened to our knowledge; and what a period of mi&s;ery have the days of our dear father proved! ought we then to weep his relea&s;e from a world where &s;orrow, under various &s;hapes, has been his con&s;tant pur&s;uer, and where, under the baneful form of remor&s;e, it has conducted him to the grave.</P>
<P>I hope my Sophia has not been unea&s;y at the unu&s;ual interval of &s;ilence, after the la&s;t di&s;mal part of my journal, which I think I &s;ent off about &s;ix weeks ago. The truth is, I have had a &s;evere relap&s;e &s;ince that period. Nervous fevers are, you know, extremely liable to return when one concludes the alarm over, and caution unnece&s;&s;ary; and this fit of ill|ne&s;s was not only attended but produced by a dejection of &s;pirits &s;o depre&s;&s;ing, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed I have been able to &s;urvive what I have &s;uffered. This la&s;t attack was indeed &s;o violent, that my
<PB N="137" REF="141">
phy&s;icians thought me for &s;everal days in extreme danger, and &s;hook their heads in &s;ilence, while poor Fanny gave me up for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It has plea&s;ed the Almighty, however, to re&s;tore me; though I am yet &s;o lan|guid that I &s;carce feel as if I had exi&s;t|ence: but I am infinitely better than I could have conceived po&s;&s;ible in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace; and the relief Fanny's mind has received from this event, has almo&s;t wholly recovered her u&s;ual good &s;pirits: her terrors on my account, by dividing her attention and engro&s;&s;ing her anxiety, have ab&s;tracted her thoughts from the pa&s;t, and her e&s;cape from a &s;till greater calamity, for &s;uch undoubtedly my death mu&s;t have proved at this juncture, when we are left in a manner de&s;erted and alone, has produced a wonderful change in her dejection. Her timidity of tem|per, even to helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, renders her &s;o dependant on me, and &s;o totally unfits
<PB N="138" REF="142">
her for &s;truggling again&s;t the difficulties of our unconnected &s;ituation, that my lo&s;s could be felt at no period &s;o &s;everely as the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered &s;ome points in her temper, however, as very fortunate at this melancholy &s;ea&s;on; when to have endured the burthen both of her &s;orrows and my own, would have proved a weight under which my &s;pirits mu&s;t have completely &s;unk; but though ex|ceedingly &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;trong agitations in the fir&s;t moments of emotion, Fanny's feelings, probably from their violence, are extremely apt to evaporate, and when di&s;&s;olved in tears and melted by afflic|tion, the &s;oothing of a friend, and a few unavailing arguments of comfort, &s;eldom fail to wipe them very &s;peedily away.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations of &s;ixteen, are in gene|ral I believe of this nature: acute but tran&s;ient. I perceive my Sophia &s;miles at the important airs of &s;eniority which
<PB N="139" REF="143">
in this la&s;t &s;entence I &s;eem to a&s;&s;ume: but two years difference of age, at our time of life, claims more than will per|haps be admitted at any other period; and Fanny's re&s;idence at the convent, from which &s;he returned but a few months ago, and the &s;eclu&s;ion that preceded it, have given an inexperienced &s;implicity to her conver&s;ation, and an innocent <HI>naivet&egrave;</HI> to her manners, which, though amiable and engaging, be&s;tow &s;ometimes an ap|pearance of childi&s;hne&s;s that might lead one to conclude her &s;till younger than &s;he is.</P>

<P>Madam de Clarence vi&s;ited us this morning. It is ten days &s;ince &s;he arrived in our neighbourhood, though we had not &s;een her; but &s;he &s;ent many kind and friendly enquiries to know how we
<PB N="140" REF="144">
were going on, and informed us, in a &s;hort note, that indi&s;po&s;ition alone could have prevented her from per&s;onally con|doling with us on our bitter di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She expre&s;&s;ed, in &s;trong terms of af|fection, the warme&s;t &s;ympathy; and a&s;|&s;ured us, that had not a di&s;order &s;imilar to mine confined her to bed, &s;he would have flown to afford us what &s;upport and con&s;olation a warm participation in our feelings could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>You know this lady is one of the few acquaintances who&s;e company and con|ver&s;ation our dear parent was ambitious of our obtaining, and who, on her part, has always been &s;o kind as to &s;olicit our's whenever her chateau afforded gaiety and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>She wept at the news of our intended departure for England. Alas! &s;aid &s;he, your worthy father always told me, that in the event of his death the remainder of the days of his children would mo&s;t
<PB N="141" REF="145">
probably be &s;pent in their native country with his friends; who, though di&s;plea&s;ed, as he has often hinted, at &s;ome part of his conduct, he doubted not would re|quire your pre&s;ence, and proffer their protection when he was no more.</P>
<P>Her kindne&s;s made our tears flow profu&s;ely; but I thought my&s;elf only at liberty to inform her, that my father had indeed very near relations in his own country, (and mentioned his brother though not by name) to whom he had recommended us: adding, that though he had been &s;o unlucky him&s;elf as to di&s;oblige his family, we were in hopes they would not prove &s;o cruel and un|relenting as to vi&s;it the &s;ins of the fa|thers upon the children.</P>
<P>You carry a recommendation in your countenances, my dear girls, &s;aid &s;he, kindly, the force of which few hearts can be hardened enough to with&s;tand. My prayers &s;hall follow you wherever
<PB N="142" REF="146">
you go; and I hope you will have the goodne&s;s now and then to inform me, that they have not been offered up in vain.</P>
<P>She then departed, having exacted a promi&s;e that we would be her gue&s;ts for a few weeks previous to our quitting France for ever.</P>
<P>Madam de Clarence is indeed the only individual, now your amiable aunt ex|i&s;ts no more, be&s;ides our good old Supe|rior and &s;ome of the &s;i&s;ters in the con|vent, whom on this occa&s;ion I can regret parting with; as &s;he is the only per&s;on with whom my father's &s;olitary plan of life has allowed of our forming an in|timacy. Independent of the vicinity of her chateau to B&mdash;, the warm af|fection with which I loved her amiable daughter, our young convent friend, originally prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her in my fa|vour; and &s;ince her death, the worthy and afflicted mother appears to have
<PB N="143" REF="147">
transferred to me that maternal tender|ne&s;s, which can exert it&s;elf no longer for the happine&s;s of my friend.</P>
<P>My father had the be&s;t opinion both of her heart and under&s;tanding; and &s;he alone (your dear aunt excepted, who&s;e lo&s;s I hourly lament) po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch in|fluence over his mind as to obtain for us a few days amu&s;ement at her chateau once or twice a year: an indulgence which his re&s;pect for her character in|duced him to grant; but which he al|ways granted unwillingly, and under ap|apprehen&s;ion that a ta&s;te for gaiety, &s;o natural to youth, imbibed in &s;uch agree|able &s;ociety, might render our u&s;ual abode, on our return, languid and un|comfortable.</P>
<P>Short, indeed, were the&s;e intervals of fe&s;tivity, and they generally pa&s;&s;ed like a gay hour away. I u&s;ed con&s;tantly to count the days till &s;pring returned; which &s;ea&s;on always brought our amiable
<PB N="144" REF="148">
friend from the di&s;&s;ipation of Paris to our peaceful neighbourhood. But un|like, alas! was her la&s;t arrival to tho&s;e which had preceded it! Her beloved daughter accompanied her not! and on my fir&s;t vi&s;it to the unfortunate mother, my unrepre&s;&s;ed &s;ympathy and affliction cemented a tender tie between us, which induced her almo&s;t to adopt me in the place of the amiable child, whom death had torn from her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I am convinced, had lingering illne&s;s afforded my father time for &s;uch a confi|dence, Madam de Clarence would have been intru&s;ted with his &s;ecret; and that to her care and tenderne&s;s he would have recommended his children.</P>

<P>I am &s;ure it will give my Sophia plea|&s;ure to learn, that in our unfriended &s;i|tuation
<PB N="145" REF="149">
the worthy Mr. Howard has mo&s;t con&s;cienciou&s;ly fulfilled the promi&s;e exacted from him by my father in his dying moments. Having performed the la&s;t &s;ad duties to that dear and be|loved parent, he exerted him&s;elf to &s;up|port and con&s;ole poor Fanny, who felt her&s;elf, during my illne&s;s, on the brink of becoming a &s;olitary being in the mid&s;t of the univer&s;e. He wrote, immediately on my father's death, to Mr. Ben&s;eley, who is nominated our guardian unle&s;s Lord Belmont conde&s;cends to take that tru&s;t on him&s;elf; and having informed him of our irreparable lo&s;s, added, that as we were committed to his charge, we expected from his hand to learn what plan of life we were now to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Mr. Ben&s;eley's an&s;wer arrived &s;ome time ago, and along with it a long letter addre&s;&s;ed to me, which I was not how|ever permitted to peru&s;e till within the&s;e few days. He begins by lamenting, in
<PB N="146" REF="150">
the mo&s;t feeling manner, the &s;evere &s;troke we have met with, and receives, he &s;ays, the tru&s;t bequeathed him as the mo&s;t va|luable legacy my father could have be|&s;towed.</P>
<P>I have had the inexpre&s;&s;ible misfortune, &s;ays he, to bury within the&s;e few months an amiable and beloved wife, with whom I might have lived in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t perfect felicity that this world can offer, had I not allowed an ungrateful anxi|ety for one denied ble&s;&s;ing to di&s;turb my peace and cloud all my other enjoyments. Heaven had left me but one wi&s;h un|granted&mdash;the want of family: and I was &s;o blind and impious, as to allow an unrea&s;onable chagrin on this account to four my reli&s;h for the many plea&s;ures which remained. At length I beheld my&s;elf on the eve of having my anxious de&s;ire gratified: my wife brought into the world a &s;on; but expired in giving birth to her infant, who &s;urvived her but a
<PB N="147" REF="151">
few days; and I am taught the duty of contentment at the &s;evere price of finding my&s;elf bereaved of all earthly felicity.</P>
<P>I receive, he adds, the children of my friend, as &s;ent to con&s;ole me for my mis|fortunes. I intend to adopt them for my own, and I hope, while I religiou&s;ly fulfill my part of their father's will, they will not be negligent in the performance of the duties that belong to them; but will regard me in the &s;oothing light of a parent, in which my late friend has in|troduced me to their acquaintance.</P>
<P>Ha&s;ten then to England, my dear chil|dren, concludes he. I hope you will have no objection to join the family of an infirm old man, who, though de|pre&s;&s;ed by grief, and racked by the ail|ments and infirmities incident to a feeble con&s;titution and declining years, pre&s;erves the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and indulgence for youth. I tru&s;t your friend, Mr. How|ard, will tran&s;act all the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="148" REF="152">
that ought to have employed your guar|dian, had he been able to have ventured on &s;o long a journey; an exertion which bad health and debilitude totally pre|vent him from attempting; perhaps, if Mr. Howard means not to remain abroad for any length of time, he may even con|trive to accompany you to your native country, and deliver up in &s;afety his charge to the old friend who impatiently expects their arrival.</P>
<P>Is not this indeed acting the part of a parent, my dear Sophy? what an amia|ble and engaging old man Mr. Ben&s;eley mu&s;t be. I long extremely to &s;ee him, and anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h to endeavour, by the utmo&s;t duty and attention, to &s;oothe his &s;orrows, and to render his old age com|fortable and happy. Though we never, never can &s;upply the place of what he has lo&s;t, may not the &s;ociety and attach|ment of two young girls, anxious to plea&s;e and willing to &s;ubmit to all his
<PB N="149" REF="153">
little humours, gratify and amu&s;e him, although we may not be able &s;ufficiently to intere&s;t his affections. I hope &s;o at lea&s;t. I am &s;ure I &s;hall feel infinite &s;atis|faction in performing a thou&s;and little &s;ervices to him, from the idea that my father &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed us to regard him as his repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>Oh, Sophia! what &s;trange rever&s;es have two &s;hort months produced! what a revolution in my mind! to leave B&mdash; the abode of our youth&mdash;and to leave it without the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of ever re|vi&s;iting it again; where every &s;urround|ing object, the very trees which rear their lofty heads &s;o high before the window at which I am writing, appear in the light of old friends who claim a tear at parting.</P>
<P>While I continue in this &s;pot, where we have &s;o con&s;tantly enjoyed my dear father's pre&s;ence, though I mi&s;s him every moment, I cannot help fancifully feeling that I am not yet quite deprived of him.
<PB N="150" REF="154">
'Tis lo&s;ing all that remains of him, to leave this his con&s;tant re&s;idence, where every thing I &s;ee is connected with his idea. Yet how gloomy, how languid does every thing around appear! perhaps remembrance will be le&s;s painful when I am not &s;urrounded by &s;cenes which re|call him perpetually to my mind in the mo&s;t endearing views.</P>
<P>Fanny and I have upbraided our&s;elves more than once for the&s;e ungrateful com|plaints, which during our private walks we u&s;ed &s;ometimes to indulge, on being &s;o wholly excluded &s;ociety, and in a man|ner detached from the re&s;t of our &s;pe|cies. Alas! we are thoroughly pu|ni&s;hed for our folly; for never till now did we feel what &s;olitude was. Our books, work, mu&s;ic, drawing, and a thou&s;and other amu&s;ements, and that which we reli&s;hed above them all&mdash;the conver&s;a|tion of our dear and indulgent parent, made the day ever appear too &s;hort for
<PB N="151" REF="155">
the innocent plea&s;ures it be&s;towed. How different, alas! is the pre&s;ent, when his lo&s;s &s;heds a gloom on every hour, and time creeps with a dreary languid pace, becau&s;e we carry to every employment no &s;pirits for exertion, and minds un|fitted for entertainment.</P>
<P>Indeed I can give no rea&s;on for the&s;e di&s;contented ideas having occurred to our minds, one excepted, which I ought to blu&s;h to confe&s;s, though I really be|lieve it was the original &s;ource of an ea|ger de&s;ire to &s;ee &s;omething more of the world than our way of life and my father's rules had hitherto permitted.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, that at the convent Fanny was extremely intimate with a young girl, much about her own age, who was very gay, very enterprizing, and very fond of novels. That &s;pecies of reading you know was prohibited, and no books of a romantic nature admitted within the grate. Fanny's young friend,
<PB N="152" REF="156">
however, contrived, through means of an indulgent relation who lived in the town, to be privately &s;upplied with abun|dant gratification of this kind, and un|known to every one but Fanny, who &s;oon imbibed the &s;ame ta&s;te, u&s;ed to devour with eagerne&s;s all the fabulous &s;tuff &s;he could get conveyed into the convent. Fanny was alone in a &s;ecret, the fruits of which &s;he &s;ufficiently enjoyed, till one unlucky day, when &s;ome of the nuns unfortunately di&s;covered the <HI>Pay&s;anne Parvenue</HI> cunningly hid beneath the quilt of her bed; and after a &s;evere pu|ni&s;hment having been inflicted for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, care was taken to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of its being repeated.</P>
<P>During a few days which Fanny pa&s;&s;ed at V&mdash;, in her way home, &s;he con|trived to expend all her pocket money on purcha&s;es of novels; and Madam de Clarence, who had undertaken to bring her thither, perceiving her fondne&s;s for
<PB N="153" REF="157">
this kind of reading, pre&s;ented her with &s;everal in vogue, &s;o that on her arrival &s;he brought with her a little library of romance, which opened a field entirely new to me, and which was &s;o in&s;inuating to a per&s;on who&s;e amu&s;ement depended &s;o much upon books as mine had ever done, that though my father di&s;approved our &s;tudies, it was not unu&s;ual for Fanny and I to retire to our favourite &s;eat in the wood, and unknown to him employ our&s;elves for hours in this forbidden reading.</P>
<P>I recollected that it was not till after reading the&s;e fallacious relations of the univer&s;al and uncontrouled empire of love, and the alluring recitals of con|que&s;t, vanity, and fame, that Fanny and I began to &s;u&s;pect my father's de&s;crip|tion of life to be the effects of &s;ingularity of temper and ta&s;te: to own the truth however, the&s;e emotions of regret on be|ing deprived of our chance for a &s;hare
<PB N="154" REF="158">
in the&s;e plea&s;ures, were but tran&s;ient and left very little impre&s;&s;ion on our minds.</P>

<P>I am now almo&s;t perfectly recovered, my dear; and have been out more than once airing with Fanny, who is now as cheerful as ever, and talks of our jour|ney to England (which is to take place as &s;oon as I am able for &s;uch an under|taking) not only without unea&s;ine&s;s, but even with eagerne&s;s. A natural &s;en&s;a|tion of &s;orrow &s;ometimes takes a mo|mentary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;pirits at the idea of leaving Languedoc; yet the pro&s;|pect of &s;hifting the &s;cene amu&s;es and delights her. Happily for her it is not her turn of mind to view evils be|fore they actually arrive; and &s;he is to|tally blind on this occa&s;ion to the many mortifications and difficulties in which
<PB N="155" REF="159">
our change of re&s;idence mu&s;t involve us, and with which it is &s;o intimately con|nected: for can we rea&s;onably hope, Sophia, that our appearance will not revive the remembrance of all the un|happy circum&s;tances of our birth: will not all our dear father's misfortunes again prove the topic of the idle and cen&s;orious, and mu&s;t not we on that ac|count prove a &s;ubject for critici&s;m, cu|rio&s;ity, and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Can we even expect that our grand|father, &s;o &s;everely exa&s;perated again&s;t his &s;on, and of cour&s;e prejudiced unfavourably towards us, will be induced to regard, with an eye of indulgence, two girls who&s;e unwi&s;hed for arrival mu&s;t renew all the pangs which this dreadful affair has co&s;t him? Perhaps an advanced age, and length of time, may have lulled his &s;orrows, to re&s;t; perhaps too the world, occupied by other matters, may almo&s;t have forgotten an event that once "fed
<PB N="156" REF="160">
its appetite for &s;candal;" how unwelcome then mu&s;t an event prove, which awakens &s;o cruelly Lord Belmont's remembrance, and revives the &s;tain which he wi&s;hes to bury in eternal oblivion.</P>
<P>How can we then flatter our&s;elves that we, who unexpectedly appear only to wound and chagrin him, &s;hall be properly acknowledged and &s;upported? Oh no! my Sophia, he will abandon and de&s;ert us: or, thinking it excu&s;able to make his grandchildren a &s;acrifice to family pride and family honour, he will plunge us into ob&s;curity; where, entirely de|pendant on his will, we mu&s;t langui&s;h out our days unnoticed and unknown.</P>
<P>You will accu&s;e me, I know, of carrying my gloomy conjectures greatly too far; for while Mr. Ben&s;eley lives we can never know the want of a pro|tector: but if Lord Belmont per&s;i&s;ts, which I think far from improbable, in forbidding our claim to his favour,
<PB N="157" REF="161">
never &s;hall we revive the recollection of my father's errors by attempting to prove our identity. This would be a &s;tep repugnant equally to delicacy and duty. What a figure, my dear, mu&s;t we then make in a foreign country, for to us it certainly is &s;o, &s;trangers and un|known, di&s;owned by tho&s;e on whom we ought to depend, and vouched for by Mr. Ben&s;eley alone, who may not &s;urvive long; for he is an old man and afflicted with many di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Fanny is blind to all tho&s;e evils which &s;he calls imaginary, and upon which I do not expatiate, though I gently point them out to her at a di&s;tance; for I wi&s;h not to damp her plea&s;ing hopes; I only de&s;ire to fortify her mind again&s;t the gloomy rever&s;e which is con&s;tantly before my own eyes, but which I hope is partly the effect of dejection. She cannot help flattering her&s;elf, &s;he &s;ays, that natural affection may work &s;o pow|erfully
<PB N="158" REF="162">
in Lord Belmont's brea&s;t, as to induce him gladly to receive us as his grandchildren, and anticipates, with all the vivacity of a lively imagination, that happy moment when we may embrace the venerable parent who yet &s;urvives.</P>
<P>Indeed the accounts which Mr. How|ard gives us of Lord Belmont, in &s;ome mea&s;ure authori&s;e the&s;e &s;anguine hopes. He tells us, that though he never was him&s;elf in his company, he is well ac|quainted with his general character, which is that of being &s;trictly and uni|formly a man of honour and integrity. Though in his temper proud, &s;tern, and inexorable, the&s;e blemi&s;hes are counter|balanced by great humanity and much warmth of affection; and though the au&s;terity and formality of his manners render his &s;ociety little courted, except by his particular friends, he is adored by his &s;ervants and dependants, and, if
<PB N="159" REF="163">
not beloved, is univer&s;ally re&s;pected by the world.</P>
<P>A &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice, &s;aid Mr. Howard, which is thought to in|fluence Lord Belmont's mind in a &s;upe|rior degree, ought undoubtedly to in|duce him to acknowledge the daughters of his elde&s;t &s;on; who, both from their &s;ex and peculiarity of &s;ituation, lay par|ticular claim to his protection; but how pride and prejudice, which form no in|con&s;iderable features of his Lord&s;hip's character, may prompt him on the other hand to act, is doubtful. However, certain it is Mr. Ben&s;eley will not re|linqui&s;h his title to be your &s;ole director, unle&s;s my Lord engages to receive you as he ought.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am afraid this is a mea&s;ure not likely to be taken: but we mu&s;t patiently wait the event. From Mr. Howard we have likewi&s;e learnt &s;ome further particulars relative to our own
<PB N="160" REF="164">
family. Though per&s;onally unac|quainted with any of the individuals of it, he has &s;een &s;everal of them, and re|members well this dreadful affair being for &s;everal months the topic of univer&s;al di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. How little, &s;aid he, did I afterwards &s;u&s;pect my friend, Mr. Sey|mour, to be the man who&s;e fate had occa&s;ioned &s;uch various reports and conjectures. Mo&s;t people, it &s;eems, believed him dead of the illne&s;s which had followed the di&s;covery: and this rumour was probably &s;pread, or at lea&s;t tacitly confirmed by his friends; who mu&s;t have regarded it as the mo&s;t likely means of putting a &s;peedy termi|nation to all curio&s;ity and &s;peculation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>You may believe both Fanny and I anxiou&s;ly enquired if any intelligence relating to the unfortunate Lady Linro&s;e had ever come to his knowledge. Mr. Howard &s;aid, that all he knew
<PB N="161" REF="165">
was from general report only; but a &s;tory which had excited &s;o &s;trongly the attention of the public, could &s;carcely be concealed in any of its particulars. Lady Linro&s;e recovered her intellects, he &s;aid, (alas! in &s;uch circum&s;tances, the return of rea&s;on can hardly be called a ble&s;&s;ing); but after the &s;evere &s;hock &s;he had received, finding her&s;elf unfit for &s;ociety, &s;he had left England and fixed her abode in the mo&s;t private manner abroad. Mr. Howard next informed us, that my uncle, whom he had often occa&s;ionally &s;een, had been thoroughly rein&s;tated, to all appearance, in my grandfather's favour; that he had two &s;ons, and he believed two if not three daughters, and that in them Lord Belmont's affections were &s;aid to be as entirely centered as his wealth mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be at his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>This part of the family then, you may believe, will not look with eyes of
<PB N="162" REF="166">
partiality on tho&s;e who have &s;ome little claim to &s;hare in what they may have conceived to be &s;olely their own: at lea&s;t that is not an unnatural conclu&s;ion, and I have drawn it from a hint which, Mr. Howard let drop with regard to my aunt, the pre&s;ent Lady Linro&s;e, whom it appears he has heard accu&s;ed of a very avaricious di&s;po&s;ition. Unwil|ling, however, to prejudice us again&s;t &s;o near a relation, he afterwards endea|voured to palliate what &s;eemed to have fallen from him through a friendly ap|prehen&s;ion that &s;he might not be much rejoiced at our appearance and preten|&s;ions.</P>
<P>He even knows we expect, we wi&s;h for nothing. Contented with what my fa|ther has bequeathed us, thankfully would we relinqui&s;h every further claim, only to be con&s;idered as Lord Belmont's children, and favoured with his counte|nance. Fanny, however, who is fol|lowing
<PB N="163" REF="167">
my pen, exclaims again&s;t this moderation, as &s;he calls it, and prote&s;ts &s;he never will con&s;ent to the propo&s;al. After having been so long buried in &s;oli|tude &s;he longs, &s;he &s;ays, to make <HI>&s;ome figure in the world,</HI> (I give you her own words) to which our <HI>birth</HI> certainly en|titles us; and far from being contented with the mere <HI>notice</HI> of our family, &s;he &s;hall not think that Lord Belmont acts up to his character of rigid honour if he does not in all re&s;pects place us on a footing with our cou&s;ins.</P>
<P>However my wi&s;hes with regard to &s;ociety may have at times coincided with Fanny's, yet I never could perfectly comprehend what delight <HI>figuring</HI> in the world, as &s;he calls it, was likely to be&s;tow. Mo&s;t women, I believe, though educated in the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered &s;olitude, may comprehend with ea&s;e the gratifica|tion re&s;ulting from the devoirs of the agreeable part of the other &s;ex; for this
<PB N="164" REF="168">
vanity is probably inherent in our na|tures, and forms a part of our original con&s;truction; but habit has made retire|ment not only agreeable, but &s;o entirely to my ta&s;te, that if ever I have it in my power to choo&s;e my own way of life, I &s;hall undoubtedly fix in the country; where I would indeed wi&s;h my abode to be occa&s;ionally enlivened by the com|pany and conver&s;ation of a few amiable people of both &s;exes, (an advantage which we have been almo&s;t totally de|prived of hitherto); but no enjoyment can I conceive in a promi&s;cuous inter|cour&s;e, in which the heart has no &s;hare.</P>
<P>My ideas of life (is not that your phraze my Sophia? who was ever much offended at the &s;eclu&s;ion in which we were retained), have been imbibed wholly from my dear father, who indeed found it a path &s;trewed with briars, and who, to render us contented with the plan he had adopted, laboured to
<PB N="165" REF="169">
repre&s;ent the world in its lea&s;t alluring point of view, as fraught with &s;nares, treachery, and crimes, where innocence was continually expo&s;ed to danger, and where friend&s;hip was almo&s;t unknown. That I have not given implicit faith to this account is entirely owing to my So|phia's livelier picture of &s;ociety; who, placed in a happier &s;phere, feels not nor dreaded the evils which have been per|petually placed before our eyes. The two years I &s;pent in the convent, (the remembrance of which I ever ble&s;s, as it fir&s;t introduced to my heart the know|ledge of the&s;e &s;oft, intere&s;ting, and en|dearing ties of friend&s;hip, which never, my Sophia, &s;hall time or ab&s;ence dimi|ni&s;h) could not fail to a&s;&s;i&s;t my father's wi&s;hes on this head.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;ingular, however, that hav|ing been fo&s;tered by the &s;ame hand, and reared on the &s;ame plan, Fanny's ideas and mine &s;hould prove &s;o little &s;imilar;
<PB N="166" REF="170">
and that the pro&s;pect of leaving France and changing our mode of life, &s;hould operate &s;o differently on our minds. What in her gives &s;pirit to every motion, and life to every look, fills my eyes with tears, and my heart with de&s;pondency and alarm.</P>
<P>Oh! my Sophia, my deare&s;t friend, your continued affection alone &s;u&s;tains me under the troubles which at pre&s;ent oppre&s;s my heart; and your journal is, after heaven, my chief, indeed my only con&s;olation! Although all chance of meeting &s;eems at pre&s;ent as di&s;tant as ever, I endeavour to &s;upport my &s;inking &s;pirits with the hope that perhaps this ble&s;&s;ing may be in wait for me &s;ooner than I expect; and that though the pub|lic capacity in which your father acts at Naples, mu&s;t render that court his u&s;ual re&s;idence, yet that unfore&s;een events may oblige him to vi&s;it England, which fate &s;eems to have determined &s;hall, be the

abode of our future days, and in which place, &s;ince the death of your aunt, I begin to imagine there is infinitely greater probability of &s;eeing you than at B&mdash;, where you now po&s;&s;e&s;s no longer that venerable relation to induce your father to re-vi&s;it our neighbourhood.</P>

<P>YOU a&s;k me &s;everal que&s;tions in your letter, which the number of informations I have had to give you, together with the many conjectures and reflections which our pre&s;ent &s;ituation naturally in|&s;pires, have, by engro&s;&s;ing my pen, pre|vented me from an&s;wering: for as I am yet but weak, I am able to write but little at a time, though chatting with you is the only employment that intere&s;ts me. I now &s;it down therefore to an&s;wer your queries.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me to tell you, in the fir&s;t
<PB N="171" REF="175">
place, what &s;ort of man this Mr. Howard is, whom I have dignified &s;o often with the epithets of amiable and worthy? you de&s;ire me to acquaint you with the fol|lowing particulars, viz. his age, fortune, manners, and appearance; and mean while you tell me you offer up your prayers for his turning out young, hand|&s;ome, rich, and agreeable; and la&s;t of all that he may po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>un coeur tendre,</HI> in which ca&s;e it mu&s;t be out of nature, you &s;ay, for the youth to have &s;pent near three months under the &s;ame roof with two <HI>&s;uch</HI> girls without becoming a &s;lave to the charms of one of them.</P>
<P>I am &s;omewhat afraid that Mr. How|ard has really proved this &s;ame unnatural being: although he certainly is ble&s;&s;ed with a very tender heart, and &s;eems be|&s;ides to have been prejudiced in our fa|vour from the commencement of our ac|quaintance, which was produced by an accident, of which I am going to inform
<PB N="172" REF="176">
you, &s;ince I have neglected my accu&s;|tomed minutene&s;s in this particular.</P>
<P>My father one evening, about three years ago, walking in the woods of B&mdash;, perceived a very fine hor&s;e, &s;ad|dled, with all its accoutrements, grazing, with the bridle impending from its neck, without any appearance of an owner or attendant being near. Struck with the apprehen&s;ion that he had probably thrown his ma&s;ter, my father traver&s;ed the dif|ferent paths of the fore&s;t, in order to give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e it was re|quired, and &s;oon was led, by the &s;ound of di&s;mal groans, to the &s;pot where the unfortunate traveller lay, &s;upported by a footman, who was endeavouring, by his ma&s;ter's orders, to pull his arm into joint, which had been di&s;located by his fall.</P>
<P>My father addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the &s;tranger, who proved to be an Engli&s;h|man, (a circum&s;tance that perhaps gave
<PB N="173" REF="177">
force to his natural humanity and bene|volence) informed him that his hou&s;e was but a quarter of a league di&s;tant, and reque&s;ted he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be removed to it, where a &s;urgeon could be &s;oon procured to &s;et the bone.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard, for he it was, after thanking my father for his fortunate a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, gratefully accepted the offer, and &s;ent his &s;ervant, by my father's de|&s;ire, to order a carriage to convey him to the hou&s;e, while another messenger was di&s;patched from B&mdash; for a neigh|bouring &s;urgeon. The operation was happily performed, and I exerted my&s;elf (Fanny being then at the convent) to render the habitation of the poor invalid as comfortable as his &s;ituation would permit. He was &s;oon able to quit his apartment, and loaded us with acknow|ledgments for this accidental &s;ervice; and my father, who rarely admitted com|pany at B&mdash;, found him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="174" REF="178">
attached to our new acquaintance, and forgot his determination of flying the &s;ight of his own countrymen in favour of Mr. Howard, who on his part &s;oon conceived the warme&s;t friend&s;hip for him.</P>
<P>He acquainted us that bad health had obliged him to try the waters of Barrege; and never having vi&s;ited the Continent before, he intended, finding him&s;elf per|fectly recovered, to make the tour of France and Italy before his return to England. He politely added, that he never &s;hould regret the interruption his plan had received from this accident, &s;ince it had been productive of an inti|macy that had given him &s;o much &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>My father's per&s;ua&s;ions prevailed with him to lengthen his &s;tay for &s;everal weeks after his confinement was at an end; and indeed he proved a mo&s;t agreeable acqui|&s;ition to our family party. He then de|parted, having faithfully promi&s;ed on
<PB N="175" REF="179">
his return to take B&mdash;in his way; and after an ab&s;ence of a year and eight months, he fulfilled his intention, and had been for &s;ome time our gue&s;t when my dear father was taken from us.</P>
<P>As to his character, our helple&s;s &s;itua|tion has developed it to us in the mo&s;t amiable point of view. Steady and &s;in|cere in his attachment to my father, it has been productive of kindne&s;s and at|tention to us, beyond what we could have hoped for or claimed from &s;o late an acquaintance: yet his friend&s;hip is te&s;tified by actions, not by prote&s;tations; for the mode&s;ty of Mr. Howard's nature is &s;uch, that our expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude never fail to embarra&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s him; and he &s;eems to regard the trouble he receives, as a tru&s;t, the faithful di&s;charge of which is a duty too indi&s;pen&s;ible to appear meritorious.</P>
<P>His countenance&mdash;(you &s;ee I go regu|larly through the li&s;t of your interroga|tories)
<PB N="176" REF="180">
&mdash;without being what one can pronounce hand&s;ome, is &s;en&s;ible, manly, and intere&s;ting, with an air of mildne&s;s which prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es you at fir&s;t &s;ight in his favour, and an expre&s;&s;ion which of all others is the mo&s;t de&s;irable&mdash;the look of a worthy hone&s;t character. He would po&s;&s;e&s;s al&s;o much the appearance of a man of fa&s;hion, or rather of a man who has been accu&s;tomed to elegant and poli&s;hed &s;ociety, did not a certain degree of diffi|dence and mode&s;ty &s;hew that he made not the <HI>grand tour</HI> early enough in life to acquire that ea&s;e which an introduction into foreign company at a youthful pe|riod generally be&s;tows: but on this head I can only judge from comparing him with &s;ome of the Pari&s;ian beaux who oc|ca&s;ionally frequented the chateau de Clarence, and who, however inferior to Mr. Howard in point of under&s;tanding, I mu&s;t acknowledge were his &s;uperiors in addre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="181">Fortune has been, alas! as &s;paring as nature &s;eems to have been prodigal of her gifts. Her avarice is by no means apparent in the figure Mr. Howard makes in this country; but he confe&s;&s;ed to my father that frugality alone enabled him to conceal it. As to his age&mdash;(pray do you imagine that my father would have con&s;igned us to the care of a man of five and twenty?) Mr. Howard adds, I dare &s;ay, twenty years more to that gay &s;ea&s;on of life. Time has not, it is true, imprinted any traces in his face which one could wi&s;h &s;pared, for they denote benevolence rather than years: he looks con&s;iderably younger than he is; and retains that &s;pirit in his eye which in his youth would have been probably termed fire, though blended with infinite &s;weet|ne&s;s. Thus our guardian, you find, is not a giddy in&s;inuating youth, who might have one day made Fanny and I pull caps; but in fact a plain, worthy, mid|dle-aged
<PB N="178" REF="182">
man, who&s;e attachment is that of a parent not of an admirer.</P>
<P>I will freely confe&s;s to you however I have &s;ometimes been led to &s;u&s;pect, from, his behaviour, that he wi&s;hed to render him&s;elf particularly agreeable to me, and that he originally di&s;tingui&s;hed me be|yond my &s;i&s;ter; perhaps this was the mere &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;ecret vanity: if &s;o, it was however an error which I by no means wi&s;hed realized; for &s;o much ap|prehen&s;ion did it give me, that I could not help avoiding his company; and when in it, my manner uniformly te&s;tified coldne&s;s and re&s;erve, from the apprehen|&s;ion that my father, (who always con|fe&s;&s;ed that he could not <HI>in&s;ure</HI> the pro|tection of his family after his death, tho' all other particulars he carefully centered in his own bo&s;om) might be induced to overlook the difference of years from the partiality he entertained for his friend, and might u&s;e all his influence to pre|vail
<PB N="179" REF="183">
with me to accept of a legal protec|tion in that unfriended &s;tate to which his decea&s;e was ever liable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o reduce us</P>
<P>I now however condemn this ab&s;urd fancy, which I almo&s;t blu&s;h to confe&s;s to you, and which I perceive to have been merely a chimera of my own brain, adopted God knows how, for I think his preference is plainly in my &s;i&s;ter's favour, who&s;e innocence and &s;implicity of man|ners appear to have warmly intere&s;ted him. During my illne&s;s, on Mr. How|ard Fanny naturally relied for &s;upport, as &s;he had no other to whom &s;he could fly; and his tender, compa&s;&s;ionate at|tention &s;eems to have cemented a &s;ort of attachment between them; in <HI>her</HI> mere gratitude alone, and in <HI>him</HI> the kindne&s;s of a guardian&mdash;a <HI>penchant</HI> which from that gentleman's time of life and pru|dence can never be &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;turb the tranquillity of either party, but
<PB N="180" REF="184">
which probably adds &s;ome &s;trength to his kind activity in our affairs.</P>
<P>As to money matters, about which in your la&s;t you are so kindly anxious, I really under&s;tand very little of them; but Mr. Ben&s;eley, who has ever had the ma|nagement of all pecuniary bu&s;ine&s;s hi|therto, undertakes to continue the charge. There is, I believe, the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds in the Engli&s;h funds, and above two hundred pi&s;toles were found in my father's cabinet for pre&s;ent u&s;e. Debts there are none, beyond what a few Louis will di&s;charge; &s;o that you, &s;ee we are &s;ecured in affluence, and inde|pendence is my utmo&s;t wi&s;h.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me, Sophia, how Fanny, who was a pretty girl of thirteen when you la&s;t &s;aw her, has turned out in point of beauty? When &s;he u&s;ed to vi&s;it us in the convent &s;he was a &s;weet looking child in a &s;tay coat, and I believe you have not &s;ince &s;een her: &s;he is now quite formed;
<PB N="181" REF="185">
and though not much, grown, for &s;he is not tall, is extremely improved both in face and form. Her little clum&s;y figure has &s;hot up, and &s;he retains only an agreeable degree of <HI>en bon point,</HI> which it would not perhaps be an advantage for her to lo&s;e even for a finer &s;hape. Her complexion is her principal charm, and that is much refined &s;ince you &s;aw her, for her features are more plea&s;ing than regular. I remember you u&s;ed to ad|mire her blue eyes, and che&s;nut hair; but if any thing in her face de&s;erves the pre-eminence, it is her teeth, which are exceedingly beautiful; and &s;he &s;till pre|&s;erves that expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weetne&s;s and timidity which renders her appearance feminine and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>She was extremely admired during our la&s;t vi&s;it at the chateau, and was not a little gratified with the notice &s;he ex|cited from &s;everal young men of fa&s;hion; the fir&s;t time in her life that &s;he had ever
<PB N="182" REF="186">
been the object of the attentions of the other &s;ex. After our return home, I could not help remarking that &s;he com|plained of our &s;eclu&s;ion with a vexation which was not however of above one day's continuance, but which had been prompted entirely by the young Chevalier, de Mer|ville's conver&s;ation, who had repre&s;ented it to her as the height of cruelty and inju&s;tice in my father, and little better than being buried alive.</P>
<P>Perhaps I my&s;elf, mi&s;led by vanity ex|cited in a &s;imilar manner by the flattery of our Pari&s;ian beaux, &s;uffered a mo|mentary regret for being deprived of &s;o many gay amu&s;ements, the attractions of which were painted in glowing colours by all who had enjoyed them. Alas! my heart is now thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the folly of its wi&s;hes. In the &s;ea&s;on of affliction our eyes are opened to the va|nity of &s;uch fallacious ideas. What would I now give to be placed in the
<PB N="183" REF="187">
very &s;ituation which in tho&s;e moments I regretted. Ble&s;&s;ed with my father's &s;o|ciety, to no other would I a&s;pire; and delighted would I look forward to the pro&s;pect of &s;pending my future days for ever at B&mdash;. How wi&s;ely then did our dear parent judge in detaining us &s;o con&s;tantly with him. Our minds, I now perceive, were unequal to the temp|tation of mixing with the world untainted by a de&s;ire for its follies, and never &s;hould we have felt a regret, tran&s;ient as it was, on returning to a home enli|vened with his pre&s;ence, had not his indulgence allowed us to join the gay party at the chateau.</P>
<P>I feel my &s;trength &s;o greatly amended, that I think of removing to Madame de Clarence's in a few days. It is but two leagues di&s;tant: and &s;evere as leaving B&mdash; mu&s;t prove, that event is ever before my eyes; and &s;ince I am now able for it, the &s;ooner it is over the bet|ter.

<P>We ye&s;terday bad adieu to our old
<PB N="185" REF="189">
dwelling. How &s;everely did I feel the pang of leaving it; and Fanny wept mo&s;t bitterly at parting with our old dome&s;tics. There&s;e and Dubois have reque&s;ted leave to attend us to England; and we mu&s;t endeavour to requite their faithful attachment, which has prevailed with them to leave their own country. When the carriage drove down the ave|nue, I was almo&s;t &s;uffocated with a va|riety of different &s;en&s;ations: the idea of our recent lo&s;s was &s;o connected with every thing I left behind, that I felt as if the parting from my father had not till then completely taken place. A number of gloomy reflections a&s;&s;ailed me likewi&s;e of another nature: we were em|barking upon a dangerous and uncertain undertaking; we were going to venture on new &s;cenes, new friends, and to a new country; where we were ignorant of the fate that might await us, and dreaded the reception we might receive.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="190">Late as is the &s;ea&s;on for travelling, we &s;hall &s;pend a fortnight with Madame de Clarence, who gave us the warme&s;t re|ception, and as &s;he perceived I was weak, depre&s;&s;ed, and unfit for company, kindly in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould take imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the apartment allotted me, where I indulged alone in many mournful reflections mo&s;t part of the day; for I would not allow poor Fanny to at|tend me while there was a gay party be|low, though the dear girl left the &s;aloon every quarter of an hour to enquire for me; equally divided between her anxiety on my account and the plea&s;ing novelty of every thing that &s;urrounded her.</P>
<P>On her part, the &s;ad &s;olemnity of quit|ting B&mdash; had made her cry mo&s;t of the way hither; but the chearful air that reigns here, and the kindne&s;s which her youthful manners and appearance excited from all the company, have
<PB N="187" REF="191">
cha&s;ed away the vapours that hung over her.</P>
<P>Having no excu&s;e to ab&s;ent my&s;elf longer, I joined the company this day at breakfa&s;t, and was introduced by Ma|dame de Clarence to her friends. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of an Engli&s;h lady, who has taken up her-re&s;idence for &s;ome months pa&s;t in the town of V&mdash;, a very lively agree|able little woman of about thirty two; and the Chevalier de Mertane and his brother, two young men of &s;plendid for|tunes, nearly related to Mon&s;ieur de Cla|rence.</P>

<P>Mrs. Weldon, the Engli&s;h lady, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a flow of &s;pirits, which, were mine able to keep pace with hers, would amu&s;e me extremely. She appears to have taken a &s;trong partiality for Fanny,
<PB N="188" REF="192">
and told her to-day what a world of con|que&s;ts &s;uch a figure as hers mu&s;t gain in London. Fanny, on her part, was, as you may believe, willing enough to give credit to the flattering compliments, and almo&s;t immediately after a&s;ked me in a whi&s;per if I did not think Mrs. Weldon the mo&s;t agreeable woman in the world. I only an&s;wered by a &s;mile, which Fanny perfectly under&s;tood, for &s;he coloured while &s;he laughed it off.</P>
<P>Mrs. Weldon afterwards attacked her on the gravity of my appearance. She &s;eems never to have Known what grief or depre&s;&s;ion means. She did me the honour to &s;ay that &s;he admired me ex|tremely; but your &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid &s;he, totally wants, the de&s;ire of being thought hand|&s;ome, which ever improves and often alone con&s;titutes beauty in the eyes of the men. I was more gratified however with the defect &s;he had remarked than with the approbation &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, how|ever
<PB N="189" REF="193">
injudicious the remark might be, for a certain degree of vanity in plea&s;ing is I believe natural to all of us. As for the Chevalier, he is about twenty-five, and rather good-looking, but finical in the mo&s;t ab&s;urd degree, and &s;o attentive, that his politene&s;s fatigues in&s;tead of in|gratiates. If you but look round, he enquires with earne&s;tne&s;s if there is any thing in which he can have the honour of &s;erving you; if you move, he flies to execute your commands; at table, he teazes you with perpetual civilities, and &s;tays at home with the ladies the whole morning to a&s;&s;i&s;t in holding their thread while they work, or to pre&s;ent his pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ors when required; in &s;hort he partakes &s;o much of the female, that I cannot help wi&s;hing to &s;ee him dre&s;&s;ed in petticoats.</P>
<P>He appears to have centered his whole ideas of happine&s;s in the vanity of making him&s;elf agreeable to our &s;ex:
<PB N="190" REF="194">
a pa&s;&s;ion, which I am afraid the poor Chevalier can hardly ever find gratified, as his plan of plea&s;ing is unfortunately founded on tormenting every one by uncea&s;ing a&s;&s;iduities. He ab&s;olutely &s;tuns and overpowers one with compliments &s;o outr&egrave; and ab&s;urd, that one is at a lo&s;s whether to laugh or be offended. Un|luckily he appears to have &s;ingled me out for the object of his pre&s;ent impor|tunities; and although I avoid him as much as is in my power, without being guilty of ab&s;olute rudene&s;s, and almo&s;t never addre&s;s my conver&s;ation to him, he contrives to engage my con&s;tant at|tention, and makes me &s;uch ridiculous &s;peeches as attract the notice and often the mirth of the company, and put me extremely out of countenance. However, Madame de Clarence always talks of him, and behaves to him with particular regard: a re&s;pect which I &s;hould imagine is alone paid to his rank and immen&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="195">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Mrs. Weldon &s;ometimes cannot entirely conceal a little chagrin, at finding I engage an attention which, before my arrival &s;he her&s;elf wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed. Yet it is impo&s;&s;ible for any mortal to think the Chavalier agreeable: but tho&s;e women who are guided by a &s;pirit for coquetry, po&s;&s;e&s;s, I have been told, an appetite for prai&s;e, which de|vours applau&s;e and admiration without di&s;tinction, wherever it can be procured; and, if I do not judge hardly, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect this to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure the ca&s;e with our lively Engli&s;h acquaintance, who&s;e gaiety is not perfectly untinctured with a degree of levity which &s;trikes me as rather bordering on impropriety: but I am my&s;elf &s;o ignorant of the freedom that cu&s;tom authori&s;es widows of a cer|tain age to take, that I ought not to decide &s;o unfavourably upon her beha|viour, e&s;pecially on &s;o &s;hort an acquaint|ance.</P>

<P>Ye&s;terday produced an event that has proved extremely di&s;agreeable. A party in the morning was propo&s;ed, to ramble through the woods, which have not yet lo&s;t their beauty; it con&s;i&s;ted of the Chevalier, Fanny, my&s;elf, and Mrs. Weldon; who, piqued at the Chevalier's neglect, (if &s;uch a phra&s;e was ever be|fore u&s;ed by a Lady to the ob&s;equious Chevalier), revenged her&s;elf by lavi&s;hing all her attentions on his brother, a weak but una&s;&s;uming youth of twenty, who al&s;o attended us.</P>
<P>We &s;oon reached a narrow path in the wood; which allowing only of two walking abrea&s;t, the Chevalier, who never quitted my &s;ide, and has been for &s;ome days pa&s;t more in&s;upportable than ever, contrived to detain me a little be|hind
<PB N="193" REF="197">
the re&s;t under pretence of pointing out to me an opening through the trees, which conveys a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;|pect: he then &s;uddenly, in a low voice, be&s;ought me to li&s;ten to the mo&s;t ardent, mo&s;t tormenting, and mo&s;t &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion which had ever agitated the human brea&s;t; and launched out before I could enough recover my &s;ur|prize to an&s;wer him, into &s;uch a &s;train of far-fetched expre&s;&s;ions of torture, hope, angui&s;h and de&s;pair, eternal mi|&s;ery and un&s;peakable tran&s;port, that had not the &s;uddenne&s;s of this unexpected propo&s;al confounded and embarra&s;&s;ed me, I &s;hould undoubtedly have had a diffi|culty in refraining from laughing in his face. Not well knowing what to reply, and not in&s;tantly recollecting my&s;elf &s;ufficiently to remember that &s;ilence may in &s;ome ca&s;es be con&s;trued into ap|probation, I was redoubling my pace to
<PB N="194" REF="198">
join the company, when he &s;eized my hand to detain me, and ki&s;&s;ed it with a violence that excited a di&s;gu&s;t: &s;o forcible, as enabled me to find in&s;tantly the u&s;e of my &s;peech, and on his repeating the&s;e words&mdash;"There can be only one objection, my adorable Mademoi&s;elle; but I hope you are not ob&s;tinate in the errors of your per&s;ua&s;ion?"</P>
<P>I made ha&s;te to a&s;&s;ure him there were innumerable ob&s;tacles, independant of the in&s;uperable one at which he hinted; and that as they were all equally un&s;ur|mountable, I entreated he would mention the &s;ubject no more.</P>
<P>Such a profu&s;ion of prote&s;tations, ac|companied with confu&s;ed and ha&s;ty common-place arguments in favour of the Catholick Church, followed, that I almo&s;t ran, in my eagerne&s;s to get rid of him, and taking hold of Mrs. Wel|don's arm, he was con&s;trained to be &s;ilent; the only time he has been &s;o one

<P>Mrs. Weldon ob&s;erving his unu&s;ual taciturnity, rallied him on it without mercy; and a&s;king him if I had been inexorable during our tete-&agrave;-tete, laughed &s;o violently at his mortified countenance and he&s;itating an&s;wers, that the poor Chevalier even blu&s;hed; as for me, I was &s;o extremely indifferent, that this &s;ubject, too delicate for a hint had another object been concerned, hardly embarra&s;&s;ed me; but Mrs. Weldon, perceiving that her teazing had all the effect &s;he could wi&s;h, did not &s;pare the Chevalier during the whole day.</P>

<P>This morning Madam de Clarence, during breakfa&s;t, whi&s;pered me that &s;he wi&s;hed to talk with me alone; and as
<PB N="196" REF="200">
&s;oon as it was over led me to her dre&s;&s;ing room, where &s;he informed me, that the Chevalier de Mertane had applied to her on the &s;ubject of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure, &s;aid &s;he, his growing attachment ever &s;ince your fir&s;t arrival, and have inclined to give the Chevalier all opportunities of manife&s;ting it to you, from the hope that an union &s;o de&s;irable and in every re&s;pect &s;o honourable, may fix my deare&s;t Hermione for ever in the country which has been &s;o long her re&s;idence, and which &s;he ought to con&s;ider as her own: how then was I hurt and di&s;ap|pointed, when he la&s;t night informed me of the &s;ucce&s;s his fir&s;t declaration had met with. But I know your ob|jection my dear, continued &s;he, per|ceiving I was going to interrupt her; but that objection is not in&s;uperable, and indeed is my principal motive for promoting this alliance. I can ea&s;ily
<PB N="197" REF="201">
enter into your feelings, prejudiced as you mu&s;t be in favour of the per&s;ua&s;ion in which you have been educated, nor will I &s;uppo&s;e for a moment that any advantages of worldly pro&s;perity could induce you to hazard, on this account alone, a perver&s;ion of principles; all I hope from this propo&s;al of the Cheva|lier's is, that you will allow &s;ome of the worthy and learned fathers of the church to conver&s;e with you on the &s;ubject of religion, that you will hear their argu|ments in favour of the great truths of the Catholick faith, which carry in&s;tant conviction as &s;oon as they are brought into light, and which in a mind &s;o young, &s;o candid, and unbia&s;&s;ed as yours, cannot fail of &s;ubduing all your &s;cruples, and determining you to place implicit tru&s;t in them.</P>
<P>After expre&s;&s;ing my gratitude to Ma|dame de Clarence for the kind impor|tunity and warmth with which &s;he inte|re&s;ted her&s;elf in my &s;piritual as well as
<PB N="198" REF="202">
temporal welfare, I a&s;&s;ured her, in the mo&s;t determined manner, that I was firmly and unalterably re&s;olved to adhere to the Prote&s;tant religion. It was a religion, I &s;aid, which admitted to my mind neither doubt nor &s;cruples: it had been my &s;upport in affliction, and was the anchor to which I leant for tru&s;t in every &s;ucceeding event of my life; and I added, that were this point entirely out of the que&s;tion, the Chevalier's pro|po&s;al, generous and di&s;intere&s;ted as it was, would have met with the &s;ame reception.</P>
<P>Various were the pleas, arguments, and intreaties, u&s;ed by this worthy friend to induce me to comply with her wi&s;h of admitting her confe&s;&s;or to conver&s;e with me on the &s;ubject; but I firmly and determinedly oppo&s;ed it. This is a &s;tep Madam, &s;aid I, again&s;t which my fa|ther has particularly cautioned me, and to which I hope you will not think me
<PB N="199" REF="203">
ungratefully ob&s;tinate if I prote&s;t I never willingly &s;hall &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Ob&s;tinate, you force me to pronounce you, cried &s;he with &s;ome heat, and in all re&s;pects unaccountable. What rea|&s;onable aver&s;ion can you have on the other hand to the Chevalier? perhaps you think he has been too pre&s;uming in confe&s;&s;ing his wi&s;hes &s;o early: but con|&s;ider, he finds him&s;elf ju&s;t on the eve of lo&s;ing you, perhaps for ever. Your intended journey has accelerated his propo&s;als; and they are of a nature that well de&s;erve to be con&s;idered. He is of a noble family, &s;plendid fortune, ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, and tenderly attached to you. Perhaps there may be &s;ome little errors in his manner which you might wi&s;h corrected; but they are the re&s;ult of good nature, and of a wi&s;h to plea&s;e: perhaps too you may imagine, and with rea&s;on, that his under&s;tanding is infe|rior to your own; but when you have
<PB N="200" REF="204">
lived as long in the world and beheld as much of mankind as I have done, you will find this di&s;advantage greatly overbalanced by many other circum|&s;tances in favour of this alliance&mdash;cir|cum&s;tances on which I have as yet but lightly touched.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered Madame de Clarence with all the warmth of gratitude which the kind intere&s;t &s;he takes in my concerns &s;o well merits, but &s;incerely avowed that the Chevalier's <HI>little errors</HI> were &s;uch as blinded me to the advantages &s;he had pointed out, and intreated that &s;he would mention a &s;ubject no more, which very fortunately proved in all re&s;pects di&s;agreeable to me; &s;ince the impediment of religion alone was a bar perfectly un|furmountable, even had I wi&s;hed the union to take place.</P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;poke with a little too much heat; but my impatience had no effect on my amiable friend, who treated

all my arguments as the effu&s;ions of bigotry on the one hand, and of romance imbibed in retirement on the other. Finding all &s;he &s;aid ineffectual, &s;he di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed me extremely by calling in her hu&s;band to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who joined, out of mere good breedings to torment me, by repre&s;enting this odious match as &s;plendid and de&s;irable in the highe&s;t degree. What! cried Madame de Cla|rence, to &s;ettle for life in England? a foreign&mdash;at lea&s;t an unknown country; where you confe&s;s you have but di&s;tant relations to receive you, and no certainty of finding friends; and to leave France, where an e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;o brilliant awaits you, and where you have it in your power to engage for your&s;elf and your &s;i&s;ter an honourable protector in the married &s;tate?</P>

This convinced me, that their opinion of their relation, in &s;pite of their warmth, was pretty much on a footing with my own: in|deed, the thoughts of the Chevalier and protection, were two ideas which could not po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;&s;ociated without exci|ting an inclination to &s;mile, for his ap|pearance is beyond mea&s;ure effeminate and in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>Seeing me quite immovable in my determination, they at la&s;t gave over their importunities; which proceeding from di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, at once gratified and oppre&s;&s;ed me.</P>

<P>The poor Chevalier!&mdash;I really think, I ought to be &s;orry for him. My con|tinued coldne&s;s, and vi&s;ible endeavours to avoid him, have at length had the de&s;ired effect: he even no longer teizes me with intreaties; but finding that tho&s;e

<P>I fancy he hardly expected a refu&s;al &s;o mortifying from an incon&s;iderate country girl, who&s;e alliance could nei|ther reflect lu&s;tre nor importance on his family; and really, according to the prevailing opinions of this quarter of the world, I cannot but admire the di&s;inte|re&s;tedne&s;s of the Chevalier's propo&s;al, however di&s;agreeable it has proved in other re&s;pects: for a marriage made without eclat, high connections, and &s;plendor, I find, by Madame de Cla|rence, is regarded by the enlightened part of the world as a weakne&s;s and

<OPENER><DATELINE>DOVER,
<DATE>NOV. 29,&mdash;.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE have accompli&s;hed our journey &s;o far, though not without having expe|rienced the perils and alarms incident to travellers. The weather, till our arrival at Calais, was delightful for the &s;ea&s;on, and our journey on the whole infinitely more agreeable, from the beauty and variety of the &s;cenes which &s;o rapidly &s;hifted before our eyes, than I could po&s;|&s;ibly have expected. You may believe, my love, it was not without a bitter pang that we bad adieu to Languedoc, and quitted, probably for ever, the abode
<PB N="209" REF="213">
of our early days; poor Madame de Cla|rence too mingled her tears with ours at parting, and charged us to remember her as a friend who &s;hould ever prove warmly and deeply intere&s;ted in our hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Calais, Fanny having been affected with a &s;light cold, attended by a &s;ore throat, Mr. Howard in&s;i&s;ted on our remaining a day or two there, before we ventured on the water; and when we were ready to depart, we found no little difficulty in procuring a ve&s;&s;el, as, owing to adver&s;e winds, they were all detained on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, one excepted, which with &s;ome trouble Mr. Howard at length procured. Soon after, as we were preparing to get on board, our landlord entered, and in|formed us that a gentleman was that mo|ment arrived, who had travelled from Paris with the utmo&s;t expedition, and was in extreme ha&s;te to get over to Eng|land,
<PB N="210" REF="214">
where bu&s;ine&s;s of real moment re|quired his pre&s;ence, but that the cir|cum&s;tance before mentioned mu&s;t una|voidably detain him at Calais, unle&s;s we thought proper to offer him a convey|ance in our ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>On this information Mr. Howard de|&s;ired the landlord to pre&s;ent his be&s;t re&s;pects to the gentleman, and to acquaint him that we were about to depart imme|diately, and that if it was agreeable to him to accompany us, we &s;hould be ex|tremely happy to accommodate him and his attendants. The gentleman was then introduced by our ho&s;t, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed his thanks to us in the mo&s;t po|lite manner, and without further delay we all went on board.</P>
<P>We had &s;carce quitted Calais, when it began to blow with tremendous vio|lence, and from a quarter that equally oppo&s;ed our getting to Dover or regain|ing the harbour we had ju&s;t quitted,
<PB N="211" REF="215">
which the &s;eamen anxiou&s;ly, tho' without &s;ucce&s;s, laboured to effect. Mr. How|ard and our fellow traveller exerted them|&s;elves to mitigate our apprehen&s;ions; a&s;&s;uring us, that as the ve&s;&s;el was in good condition, and had many able hands on board, our fears greatly magnified the danger. A new alarm however &s;oon after occurred which rendered our &s;itua|tion &s;eriou&s;ly critical: &s;ome part of the apparatus of the pump was found defec|tive; and a leak having been di&s;covered, the water began to make way very ra|pidly. Upon this information, the coun|tenances of our comforters betrayed a &s;udden though but a momentary anxiety that wholly bereaved us of that &s;upport which their apparent ea&s;e and indifference had hitherto in &s;ome mea&s;ure afforded us. Fanny, almo&s;t di&s;tracted, threw her&s;elf into the arms of Mr. Howard, as if for protection, and I, who&s;e di&s;may, though not le&s;s &s;evere was le&s;s audible, &s;at &s;i|lently
<PB N="212" REF="216">
offering up my prayers to heaven with a re&s;olute compo&s;ure, the mere ef|fects of hopele&s;s de&s;pair, every moment expecting to be &s;wallowed up in one of the frightful waves which were ri&s;ing like mountains on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard being occupied in vainly endeavouring to moderate Fanny's ter|rors, and our &s;tranger companion gone to examine into the nature of our alarm, I was in a manner left to my own reflec|tions: and at length throwing my arms about my poor Fanny, who reclined her head almo&s;t lifele&s;s upon Mr. Howard's &s;houlder&mdash;We are but going to rejoin our dear father, my love, cried I, nor is there any thing &s;o very frightful in the idea. The Almighty might have been infinitely le&s;s merciful in his di&s;pen&s;ations. We &s;hall expire together, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant: one mi&s;erable &s;urvivor will not be pre&s;erved to mourn in a fo|reign country her irreparable lo&s;s; where
<PB N="213" REF="217">
not a pitying friend might be found to con&s;ole her under the &s;everity of afflic|tion.</P>
<P>Affected by the&s;e words, our fellow traveller, who&s;e return I had not per|ceived, be&s;ought me in the mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful manner to allow him the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me; and throwing his arm round me, &s;upported me as I &s;at, as far as was in his power, from the di&s;agreeable ef|fects of the ince&s;&s;ant rolling of the ve&s;&s;el. Stupified by fear, I attended only to my dear Fanny, who had turned and locked her&s;elf in my embraces, and whom I la|boured by various arguments to in&s;pire with that fortitude and re&s;ignation which religion can alone di&s;pen&s;e in a moment &s;o replete with horror. No moment could indeed prove more dreadful. The oaths and execrations of one half of the &s;eamen, who&s;e profanity &s;eemed too ha|bitual to de&s;ert them even on this awful occa&s;ion; the utter de&s;pondency of the
<PB N="214" REF="218">
other, and the di&s;may of all our attend|ants, produced on the whole a &s;cene of terror and confu&s;ion, on which I cannot reflect without horror inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard and our fellow traveller were the only per&s;ons on board who at this critical juncture pre&s;erved their u&s;ual compo&s;ure. The danger, however ex|treme and immediate, could neither di&s;|tract their attentions nor wholly ab&s;orb their cares; while the former employed him&s;elf uncea&s;ingly to &s;upport the exhau&s;t|ed &s;pirits of my &s;i&s;ter, the latter &s;eemed to con&s;ider me as his peculiar charge; and his conver&s;ation, at once &s;oothing, &s;pi|rited, and in&s;inuating, in&s;en&s;ibly fortified my courage, and &s;trengthened my mind.</P>
<P>Gratified by the generous exertions made to &s;u&s;tain my drooping fortitude, I at length turned round to regard the per&s;on to whom I con&s;idered my&s;elf as &s;o particularly indebted, and was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed to perceive, in the deport|ment
<PB N="215" REF="219">
of this unknown young man, a &s;triking and peculiar elegance, and in his countenance an intere&s;ting intelli|gence, which I was amazed I had not before more particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;erenity of his a&s;pect at that for|midable in&s;tant &s;truck me &s;o forcibly, that I involuntarily exclaimed&mdash;oh with what &s;uperior re&s;olution mu&s;t God Al|mighty have endowed <HI>men,</HI> if you, Sir, are really as unconcerned as you appear at this tremendous moment.</P>
<P>I believe this &s;ally made him &s;mile. Madam, &s;aid he, I have ever been of opinion that in natural courage the la|dies are infinitely our &s;uperiors. It mu&s;t be owned, perhaps, that men are not quite &s;o ingenious in apprehending or in fore&s;eeing evil at a di&s;tance; but when it actually arrives, we &s;eldom &s;upport its bitterne&s;s with more genuine greatne&s;s of mind than the gentler &s;ex often te&s;tify in the mo&s;t arduous and painful circum|&s;tances.
<PB N="216" REF="220">
The compo&s;ure and re&s;olution, added he, which I have ju&s;t been con|templating has but confirmed this idea, and augmented my admiration of female fortitude.</P>
<P>As he pronounced the&s;e words, the &s;ailors gave a loud huzza on having at length effected the re-adju&s;tment of the pump. Fanny, unu&s;ed to &s;uch rude de|mon&s;trations of joy, imagined all was over, and that we were in&s;tantly going to the bottom; but Mr. Howard and our companion &s;oon relieved her fears, by congratulating us on the &s;afety which this tran&s;action indicated, and as the &s;torm now began to abate con&s;iderably, our apprehen&s;ions were le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. Still however it blew from an unfavoura|ble point, and the ma&s;ter told us he had no hopes of gaining Dover till next morning; but the &s;ecurity of which he a&s;&s;ured us made us con&s;ider that delay as of little moment; and with revived
<PB N="217" REF="221">
&s;pirits my &s;i&s;ter and I entered into con|ver&s;ation with Mr. Howard and our agreeable new acquaintance, to who&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate &s;upport I owed in a great mea&s;ure the compo&s;ure for which he &s;o eagerly applauded me.</P>
<P>I now had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve him, and found, that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing as had been his figure on a cur&s;ory view, it lo&s;t nothing of my admiration from being more mi|nutely con&s;idered. He &s;eemed about twenty four, and I think I never beheld a countenance that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed so large a portion of that expre&s;&s;ion, to which, from inability otherwi&s;e to define it, is u&s;ually given the appellation of <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Howard was delighted with his conver&s;ation, which &s;eemed the re&s;ult of a mind cultivated and enlightened, joined to an exten&s;ive knowledge of the world. The circum&s;tances of our &s;ituation en|tirely di&s;carded the formalities of a re|cent introduction, and &s;eemed to pave
<PB N="218" REF="222">
the way for intimacy. We conver&s;ed as old friends, who had been unexpectedly pre&s;erved by the mercy of Providence: nor did it, I believe, once occur to any of the party, till we had actually landed on &s;hore, that this agreeable &s;tranger was but the acquaintance of a night, and that we were even ignorant of his name.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard invited him to breakfa&s;t with us at the inn, where we did not ar|rive till eleven in the morning; and he accepted it with evident marks of plea|&s;ure. A &s;light refre&s;hment was then brought in: of which, exhau&s;ted and fa|tigued as we were, my &s;i&s;ter and I were unable to partake, and we all &s;oon after retired to re&s;t, which was, you may con|jecture, extremely requi&s;ite. A few hours however &s;ufficed to refre&s;h us; and awaking about &s;ix in the evening, we immediately aro&s;e, and on entering the parlour found the gentlemen impa|tiently expecting us to dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="223">After many obliging enquiries, and hoping that we had not &s;uffered from our fears and fatigues&mdash;I have been acknow|ledging to Mr. Howard, &s;aid our fellow traveller, both a failure in gallantry and a degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which may in all probability &s;ubject me to the mortification of your cen&s;ure; but it mu&s;t be owned, notwith&s;tanding the danger you two la|dies were expo&s;ed to and the &s;evere ap|prehen&s;ions you underwent, for which I think none could feel more poignantly than I my&s;elf did, that it will never be in my power to reflect on that night without experiencing the mo&s;t lively emotions of plea&s;ure at the recollection; &s;ince it has procured me the honour of an acquaintance which I &s;hall ever re|gard as one of the mo&s;t fortunate events of my life.</P>
<P>To this compliment, too flattering for a reply, we could only an&s;wer by an in|clination of our heads. Whether we
<PB N="220" REF="224">
all prized our exi&s;tence the more for having been &s;o lately on the point of lo&s;ing it I know not, but our recent dan|ger certainly be&s;towed an additional re|li&s;h on our pre&s;ent &s;ecurity, and gave &s;uch a lightne&s;s to our hearts, as put all ceremony and con&s;traint at defiance. My mind had not, ever &s;ince our irrepara|ble lo&s;s, felt &s;o unburthened either from painful recollections or anticipated evils as it then did, and in ble&s;&s;ing heaven for our &s;afety I did not fail to lift up my &s;oul in thankfulne&s;s that I was ena|bled to enjoy it from a flow of &s;pirits which have been long a &s;tranger to my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Our agreeable companion partook of our gaiety; and joined in the conver&s;a|tion with a polite vivacity which ani|mated and &s;upported it. Ah! thought I, more than once during the evening, were all the Engli&s;h as amiable and ac|compli&s;hed as this &s;pecimen &s;eems to
<PB N="221" REF="225">
indicate, little &s;hould I regret that fate has condemned me to re&s;ide among them.</P>
<P>You may believe, Sophia, we were all not a little de&s;irous of knowing the name of a per&s;on who&s;e addre&s;s and ap|pearance had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed us &s;o &s;trongly in his favour, and with whom we had been conver&s;ing for hours on a footing of intimacy. He had greatly the advan|tage of us in this particular, had his cu|rio&s;ity been equally excited; for hearing Mr. Howard, my &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf, mu|tually name each other, he was enabled to give us our proper appellations of di&s;tinction, while all we could di&s;cover in regard to him was, what occa&s;ionally dropt from him in the cour&s;e of conver|&s;ation, and that went no further than to inform us that he had been &s;everal years abroad, which time he had &s;pent in re&s;iding at the different courts of Eu|rope, where he appeared intimately ac|quainted with &s;everal characters of emi|nence
<PB N="222" REF="226">
not wholly unknown to Mr. How|ard.</P>
<P>When Fanny and I got up to retire for the night, he approached to take leave of us, &s;aying that family affairs required him to ha&s;ten his departure; but the happine&s;s of your company, &s;aid he, has made me &s;teal a few hours from my journey: but may I be allowed to flatter my&s;elf that you will permit me the fa|vour of enquiring after your healths in town, where I hope to be in a &s;hort time. I confe&s;s the boldne&s;s of this re|que&s;t may ju&s;tly induce you to accu&s;e me of temerity; but after the good for|tune fate has conferred in this introduc|tion, I cannot prevail with my&s;elf to relinqui&s;h the unlooked for benefit that has been thrown in my way. May I then flatter my&s;elf you will favour me &s;o far? We a&s;&s;ured him we &s;hould be extremely happy to &s;ee him; and referred him to Mr. Howard for the knowledge
<PB N="223" REF="227">
of our abode, which is unknown to our|&s;elves. We are &s;trangers and foreigners in England, &s;aid I, and &s;hall certainly be much plea&s;ed to meet again with our fir&s;t Engli&s;h acquaintance. We then wi&s;hed him an agreeable journey, and left the room.</P>
<P>When we had retired, this unknown expre&s;&s;ed in warm terms to Mr. Howard his wi&s;hes for improving this accidental acquaintance, made many polite offers of &s;ervice, and di&s;covered his name at parting by pre&s;enting him with a card, on which was written the following ad|dre&s;s&mdash;the Honourable Charles Roat&s;|ley, St. James's Square. He then &s;et off in a carriage and four at half pa&s;t two in the morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard has per&s;uaded us to re|main all this day at Dover, and perhaps to|morrow, in order to recruit our &s;pirits af|ter our fatigue, and I have acquie&s;ced be|cau&s;e my &s;i&s;ter is rather indi&s;po&s;ed; but the

<P>OH! my Sophia, how unfortunate have we been! Our friend, good Mr. Ben&s;eley is no more! he expired only two days ago of the gout, which had at|tacked his &s;tomach, and here are we in London, this immen&s;e overgrown city, without one &s;ingle human being, Mr. Howard excepted, who has the mo&s;t di&s;|tant intere&s;t in us, or probably knows of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="229">Oh! what a burthen mu&s;t we prove to that worthy man's mind, and how lit|tle claim, except from his friend&s;hip to my father, have we to give him &s;o much trouble.</P>
<P>This unfortunate and unfore&s;een cala|mity has overwhelmed us with affliction. It has broken all our mea&s;ures, and in|terrupted all our plans. We feel as in a de&s;ert. This is indeed <HI>&s;olitude,</HI> to be without friends and without protection, except what we receive from the kind|ne&s;s of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard this morning (for we got hither la&s;t night, but unwilling to di&s;turb Mr. Ben&s;eley's &s;ober family at &s;o late an hour, procured very good lodgings in a neighbouring &s;treet) went him&s;elf to in|form our worthy guardian of the arrival of his gue&s;ts. You may ea&s;ily conclude how much &s;hocked he was on being in|formed by the footman who attended at the door that Mr. Ben&s;eley had expired
<PB N="226" REF="230">
on Monday la&s;t: he returned in&s;tantly in great perturbation to inform us of this di&s;mal intelligence.</P>
<P>This is an accident extremely unfor|tunate, &s;aid he, as Mr. Ben&s;eley was undoubtedly the propere&s;t per&s;on to me|diate between you and your grand fa|ther; but I hope natural affection will plead for his &s;on's offspring &s;o power|fully as to induce him immediately to take you under his own protection, in which ca&s;e no material inconvenience will accrue from the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh! in what unavoidable difficulties did your friendly kindne&s;s involve you, my dear Sir, cried I, when you under|took &s;o trouble&s;ome a charge as we mu&s;t prove.</P>
<P>Talk not to me in this &s;tyle, my dear Mi&s;s Seymour, cried he, interrupting me &mdash;the trifling a&s;&s;i&s;tance I had it in my power to offer you towards regulating your affairs at B&mdash;, was without a com|pliment
<PB N="227" REF="231">
&s;o greatly recompen&s;ed by the opportunity with which I was favoured of manife&s;ting, however feebly, my friend&s;hip for your father, that it pains me to think you &s;hould imagine any thanks due to an occurrence which em|ployed agreeably a little idle time that mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have lain heavy and lan|guid on my hands: as to the honour you did me in allowing me to attend you hi|ther, it was a favour as well as a grati|fication for which my thanks in&s;tead of yours are due.</P>
<P>I believe that had Mr. Ben&s;eley's death taken place previous to your father's, he would have nominated me your guar|dian: as this event has followed, I owe it in duty to my decea&s;ed friend, as well as from my e&s;teem for you, to take on me the care of your affairs; and as the fir&s;t proof of your obedience, I exact an eternal &s;ilence on the &s;ubject, either of apology or gratitude. Let us con&s;ider

then, continued he in the &s;ame breath, to prevent our again interrupting him with apologies, what &s;teps we ought next to pur&s;ue. I am of opinion that an application to Lord Belmont cannot too &s;oon be made; and if I have your per|mi&s;&s;ion, &s;hall undertake to write to him this very day.</P>
<P>We in&s;tantly clo&s;ed with the propo&s;al, and he directly left us to &s;et about the ta&s;k; in the &s;ucce&s;s of which he &s;eems as anxious, and as deeply intere&s;ted, as if we were his mo&s;t intimate connections and our lives depended on the i&s;&s;ue.

A few hours will decide all&mdash;will determine whether we are out|ca&s;ts from our family, de&s;erted and friend|le&s;s, or received with tender emotion to the bo&s;om of a parent, to whom, though

unknown, my heart glows with the warm|e&s;t affection and mo&s;t filial re&s;pect. My &s;oul, melted by an eternal &s;eparation from one yet more dearly beloved, di&s;&s;olves with the &s;oft ideas which ru&s;h upon my mind.

<P>Fanny, who&s;e heart is always full of &s;oothing hopes, &s;trives to recompence the di&s;appointment we have &s;uffered in the death of Mr. Ben&s;eley, by anticipa|ting happine&s;s under the protection of Lord Belmont; but the painful uncer|tainty of what may be his Lord&s;hip's
<PB N="230" REF="234">
determination, is, alas! rendered more acute by delay. Mr. Howard went out ye&s;terday immediately after dinner, in|tending him&s;elf to deliver the letter he had written.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant who opened the door, on being a&s;ked if his Lord&s;hip was at home, returned for an&s;wer that he was not ex|pected till &s;pring.</P>
<P>Is then my Lord in the country? &s;aid Mr. Howard.</P>
<P>No, Sir, he is &s;till at Nice.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard was much di&s;appointed at this information; and as he held the letter in his hand with a look of chagrin, the footman told him, that if he was anxious to have it &s;ent &s;afe he might leave it with his Lord&s;hip's &s;teward, who lodged at pre&s;ent in the hou&s;e, and who would take care to di&s;patch it with a proper direction. As he &s;poke the&s;e words, the &s;teward him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed the door; and hearing his name pronounced,
<PB N="231" REF="235">
civilly advanced to know if Mr. How|ard had any commands for Lord Bel|mont in which he could a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and a&s;ked him to walk into the parlour.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard &s;eized this opportunity for making &s;ome further enquiries; and was informed, that my Lord being thought in a declining &s;tate of health, had been ordered by his phy&s;icians abroad; that he had been ab&s;ent almo&s;t a twelvemonth, attended by his grand-&s;on, the pre&s;ent Lord Linro&s;e, who was likewi&s;e advi&s;ed to try a warmer climate for the recovery of a cough, which was apprehended to be con&s;umptive. The death of his fa|ther, the late Lord, the &s;teward added, had induced the family to expect the immediate return both of Lord Linro&s;e and his grand-father; but the la&s;t di&s;|patches had entirely contradicted this idea, intimating that Lord Belmont had received &s;uch e&s;&s;ential benefit from the &s;alutary air of Nice, that he had deter|mined
<PB N="232" REF="236">
to continue there till his di&s;order was wholly removed; and that Lord Linro&s;e dared not venture as yet braving a chilly winter in England.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard then returned to us, not a little hurt at the intelligence he was con&s;trained to communicate. Oh, So|phia, how unfortunate! Had we been made &s;ooner acquainted with the&s;e par|ticulars, we might have remained in our peaceful retreat at B&mdash;, where, happy in the protection and friend&s;hip of Ma|dame de Clarence, we mu&s;t have enjoyed comfort and contentment; but poor Mr. Ben&s;eley's death is an evil we dreaded not; and bequeathed to his care, we were left no choice as to our re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Nothing can prove more delicate, more embarra&s;&s;ing, than our pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation. I am but ill ver&s;ed, I own, in the cu&s;toms which in this part of the world propriety pre&s;cribes; yet &s;urely Mr. Howard, neither from age nor ap|pearance,
<PB N="233" REF="237">
can be deemed a proper pro|tector, under the a&s;&s;umed appellation of guardian, for two young girls unfriended and unknown, particularly when he is him&s;elf con&s;cious that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not even that nominal title to remain con|&s;tantly under the &s;ame roof with us. It mu&s;t &s;ubject us to ob&s;ervation, and pro|bably may even provoke cen&s;ure; yet &s;o tender is the point, that I &s;hould blu&s;h but to hint it to him.</P>

<P>Mr. Howard, after appearing very thoughtful mo&s;t part of ye&s;terday even|ing, made an apology for ab&s;enting him|&s;elf for an hour or two, and left us.</P>
<P>We had indeed been extreme bad company. Fanny was &s;unk and di&s;ap|pointed. What a rever&s;e from the gay chimeras that had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her
<PB N="234" REF="238">
mind. Languid and di&s;pirited, &s;he had reclined, half a&s;leep, upon a chair, leav|ing me to &s;upport a conver&s;ation with Mt. Howard which evidently intere&s;ted neither party; but a&s;hamed of the bur|then we are reduced to impo&s;e on that amiable man, and which (though from friendly anxiety alone) appeared to hang very heavily on his mind, I vainly ex|erted my&s;elf to appear in &s;pirits in order to lighten his vi&s;ible unea&s;ine&s;s, and af|fected to be uncon&s;cious that our &s;itua|tion was either &s;o awkward or &s;o uncom|fortable as it in fact appeared to me.</P>
<P>The moment he was gone, however, my half &s;uffocating emotions got vent; and &s;uddenly giving way to the angui&s;h that oppre&s;&s;ed me, I threw my arms about my deare&s;t Fanny's neck, and bur&s;t into a flood of tears, which flowed with profu&s;ion, from a variety of painful feelings.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed to the tender attentions
<PB N="235" REF="239">
of paternal care, &s;oftened by the care&s;&s;es and indulgence of paternal fondne&s;s, my heart felt&mdash;bitterly felt! the painful void of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing none to whom I owed affection and duty&mdash;none from whom I could claim tenderne&s;s and regard.</P>
<P>Oh! my deare&s;t Fanny! cried I, were we this in&s;tant to expire, who would &s;hed one tear over us? My Sophia indeed, my kind, my affectionate Sophia, &s;till remains to me; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a friend, I ought not to repine: but who, in all this populous and extended coun|try, (Mr. Howard excepted) were we to lay down our heads and die before ano|ther day returned, would pay us even a tribute of pa&s;&s;ing regret. Every one el&s;e is ble&s;t with &s;ome tender relation who calls forth and returns the &s;oothing &s;en&s;ations of intere&s;t and attachment, but we are unknown, unloved, and uncon|nected on the earth!</P>
<P>Having vented the fir&s;t effu&s;ions of
<PB N="236" REF="240">
my feelings, I grew more compo&s;ed; and reproaching my&s;elf for this weak indul|gence, which had &s;everely affected my poor Fanny, who, naturally &s;anguine, was not di&s;po&s;ed for &s;uch deep depre&s;&s;ion had I not &s;et her an example of dejec|tion, I dried my eyes and endeavoured all in my power to &s;ooth and con&s;ole her; but the ta&s;k was not &s;o ea&s;y as I had imagined. Grief and fear are often infectious; and I had pointed out the me|lancholy independence of our &s;ituation in terms &s;o alarming as had intimidated and alarmed her. In attempting to give her comfort however I profitted by my own arguments, and began to perceive that we had not in fact that rea&s;on for de&s;pondency which the &s;olitude of our &s;ituation had at fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted. Letters would not be long in reaching Nice, and a &s;hort &s;u&s;pence would one way or other &s;oon compo&s;e all our agitations.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections produced a tolerable
<PB N="237" REF="241">
degree of compo&s;ure by the time Mr. Howard returned. I have been vi&s;iting my brother's family, &s;aid he, which I have not had an opportunity of doing till this evening, and have brought a me&s;&s;age from his lady, reque&s;ting that you both would favour her with your company to-morrow to dinner. She in|tends to have the plea&s;ure of waiting on you in the morning, and hopes to pro|cure you &s;ome little amu&s;ement by at|tending you to whatever appears curious to &s;trangers in this metropolis.</P>
<P>We gratefully accepted the propo&s;al. He afterwards told us that he had been paying another vi&s;it to Lord Belmont's &s;teward. He tells me, &s;aid he, that Lady Linro&s;e is &s;till at her &s;eat in Northamp|ton&s;hire, where &s;he has re&s;ided con&s;tantly &s;ince her Lord's death, and I mean, &s;hould you approve of it, by only mak|ing a few alterations, to addre&s;s the let|ter
<PB N="238" REF="242">
to her Lady&s;hip which was intended for my Lord.</P>
<P>Mean time, continued he, my &s;i&s;ter in law will be delighted to have the fa|vour of your company, not as occa&s;ional vi&s;itors only, but as inmates of her fa|mily. She entreated me with much ear|ne&s;tne&s;s to make this propo&s;al to you; but I told her, although I felt a guar|dian's intere&s;t, I could not ab&s;olutely claim a guardian's authority, and mu&s;t leave her to prevail with my charming wards by her own interce&s;&s;ion when &s;he is introduced to their acquaintance; I hope however you will find Mrs. Hin|don's hou&s;e &s;o agreeable as may induce you to oblige her by making it your abode till you are otherwi&s;e &s;ettled to your &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>With how much delicacy was this propo&s;al made. The compliment of &s;uch an offer from an utter &s;tranger could not but have been &s;ugge&s;ted from Mr. How|ard's
<PB N="239" REF="243">
having repre&s;ented in &s;trong co|lours our helple&s;s and unconnected &s;itua|tion. The idea hurts and mortifies me; yet we cannot but feel gratified by Mr. Howard's endeavours to per&s;uade us to regard this civility as a favour conferred upon his &s;i&s;ter in&s;tead of being received from her hands.</P>
<P>While we remain in this uncertainty, in order to guard again&s;t curio&s;ity, I have reque&s;ted Mr. Howard to conceal our real &s;ituation and connections except from his brother's family, to whom he promi&s;es to enjoin &s;ecre&s;y.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard's letter to Lady Linro&s;e, briefly &s;tating our &s;ituation and reque&s;t|ing her mediation with Lord Belmont, was &s;ent off by this day's po&s;t. He tells her Lady&s;hip that we are at pre&s;ent in London, where the accident of Mr. Ben&s;eley's death leaves us (in our grand father's ab&s;ence) entirely dependant on her Lady&s;hip, who&s;e countenance we ven|ture
<PB N="240" REF="244">
to entreat, &s;ince we are uncon&s;cious of having in any way forfeited our right to the protection of our family; and who&s;e good offices our friendle&s;s &s;tate leads us to &s;olicit, as well from her be|nevolence and humanity as from the ties of con&s;anguinity which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us. It is directed to Northampton&s;hire, and we anxiou&s;ly wait her Lady&s;hip's re|ply.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon was &s;o kind as to break|fa&s;t with us this morning, accompanied by her hu&s;band. She is a little plump woman, between thirty and forty, who&s;e countenance is by no means plain, but who&s;e addre&s;s is far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing either poli&s;h or grace. What her manners wanted in elegance was however fully made up by kindne&s;s and attention. She overwhelmed both Fanny and me with expre&s;&s;ions of civility and offers of friend|&s;hip, and told us that &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on our becoming her gue&s;ts, and making her
<PB N="241" REF="245">
hou&s;e our own as long as we &s;hould find it agreeable. She regretted extremely, &s;he &s;aid, that a country cou&s;in, who how ever would be otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of in a few days, at pre&s;ent occupied the apartment, which afterwards would be heartily and entirely at our &s;ervice: but as &s;oon as &s;he could get her trumpery removed, and things were put in proper order, &s;he hoped we would favour her &s;o far as to take immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>This ho&s;pitality, though rather rudely expre&s;&s;ed, was &s;o extremely benevolent, and &s;o happily timed for our difficul|ties, that I knew not how to expre&s;s in terms &s;ufficiently fervent the gratitude it in&s;pired.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon then carried us an airing in her coach, through &s;everal of the prin|cipal &s;treets of the city, and appeared &s;o kindly &s;olicitous for our entertainment, that during our ride &s;he was continually planning different parties of plea&s;ure, or
<PB N="242" REF="246">
de&s;cribing different places of amu&s;ement, to which &s;he promi&s;ed to accompany us; and &s;he regretted much that the morn|ing was too far advanced to admit of our &s;eeing any of the &s;ights and curio&s;i|ties which &s;he &s;aid abounded in every quarter of the town.</P>
<P>On returning to &s;et us down at our lodgings, &s;he invited us to dine at her hou&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ending her car|riage for us before her hour of dining.</P>
<P>Finding it near three o'clock, we &s;et about dre&s;&s;ing with the utmo&s;t expedi|tion; but &s;o ab&s;urdly late are the hours in this part of the world, that though it is now pa&s;t four in the afternoon, the coach has not yet made its appearance, and Mr. Howard tells me people here don't think of &s;itting down to dinner till the evening is far advanced.</P>

<P>Our entertainment ye&s;terday was &s;plen|did, and the furniture of Mr. Hindon's hou&s;e &s;uperb and expen&s;ive beyond what I &s;hould have expected in the abode of a man who owes his riches in a great mea&s;ure to his own indu&s;try. Every thing in the family be&s;poke opulence. The appearance of the lady of the man|&s;ion did not however, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, accord with the elegance that &s;urrounded her; but &s;he was &s;o extremely kind and obliging, that it is ungrateful to lay an ungenerous &s;tre&s;s on a fault which proceeds not from the heart, and which for that rea&s;on mu&s;t be un&s;een by her friends though &s;triking to the eyes of a &s;tranger</P>
<P>The company con&s;i&s;ted of a Sir Jona|than Farnford, his lady, and daughter, a
<PB N="244" REF="248">
young lady of &s;ixteen, ju&s;t come from a boarding &s;chool, Captain Wilmot, ne|phew to Mrs. Hindon, and a mode&s;t looking girl, who&s;e &s;urname I heard not, as Mr. and Mrs. Hindon always &s;poke to her by the familiar appellation of Jenny, and who I conjectured was the country cou&s;in before mentioned. In this idea I was confirmed from ob&s;erving the unfeeling neglect with which &s;he was treated, not only by the lady of the hou&s;e, but by all her gue&s;ts (our party excepted) who &s;eemed to have taken a hint from that lady's behaviour to regard the poor girl as an inferior.</P>
<P>I could not help extremely pitying her &s;ituation, which was to the la&s;t de|gree mortifying, particularly as her dif|fidence and timidity appeared rather to a&s;k for encouragement than to provoke rebuke. She evidently felt uncomforta|ble and a&s;hamed; and &s;at &s;ilently negli|gent of what was pa&s;&s;ing, as if perfectly
<PB N="245" REF="249">
unconcerned in the &s;cene, and without once attempting to join in the conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>The painful dependence of this young woman &s;truck me the more forcibly as it was contra&s;ted with that flow of ci|vility, warm and unbounded, which Mrs. Hindon abundantly lavi&s;hed upon us, though utter &s;trangers, and which, while it gained my innocent Fanny's heart, appeared to me &s;o greatly beyond what an acquaintance of a few hours could either excite or authorize in a mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of delicacy and refine|ment, that though charmed with it for the fir&s;t half hour, and delighted with the flattering idea of having &s;o early in&s;pired a predilection &s;o fortunate in our pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances, I began to con&s;ider, before the evening was over, that kind|ne&s;s be&s;towed &s;o fervently, ere time had been given not only for inve&s;tigation but even for common knowledge, mu&s;t be
<PB N="246" REF="250">
too indi&s;criminate either to prove grati|fying or la&s;ting, and &s;eemed rather the effu&s;ions of the tongue than the overflow|ings of a heart warm and &s;incere. I con|fe&s;s indeed, that the vi&s;it of ye&s;terday to Mrs. Hindon has not encrea&s;ed my de|&s;ire of re&s;iding in her hou&s;e; yet as it is the only eligible &s;cheme that pre&s;ents it|&s;elf at pre&s;ent, and &s;he is eager that we &s;hould accept of her repeated invitations, we have re&s;olved for a &s;hort time to comply.</P>
<P>I was extremely a&s;toni&s;hed, during this vi&s;it, to ob&s;erve the remarkable dif|ference between our manners (for &s;till mu&s;t I regard France as my own coun|try) and tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h. I own I have been very little conver&s;ant in any &s;ociety; yet when I have been at the chateau de Clarence, and while I was permitted at your aunt's earne&s;t entrea|ties to &s;pend that happy three weeks (never to be forgotten) in all the inno|cent
<PB N="247" REF="251">
gaieties of M&mdash; with my beloved Sophy, I remember the gentlemen who occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited at your hou&s;e were all uniformly attentive and polite in the highe&s;t degree, and were ever &s;o well bred as to appear gratified with our pre|&s;ence and plea&s;ed with our conver&s;ation, whatever their private &s;entiments might be; but here, my dear, the behaviour of the men was not only indifferent and un|complai&s;ant, but often rude and uncivil.</P>
<P>Captain Wilmot, though very gayly dre&s;&s;ed, and in a &s;tyle which betrayed no great di&s;like to the idea of attracting the notice of the other &s;ex, yet endeavoured by various methods to di&s;cover his per|fect di&s;regard of the ladies pre&s;ent, whom he did not &s;eem to think de&s;erving even of the common attentions u&s;ually paid them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon, on our entering, intro|duced him to us; which having pro|duced a ha&s;ty bow, he afterwards reclined
<PB N="248" REF="252">
with his back to the wall in a carele&s;s attitude, and then &s;trolled about the room, occa&s;ionally joining the other gen|tlemen, who were chatting by them&s;elves in a corner.</P>
<P>The&s;e airs had the effect (for which I make no doubt they were intended) of augmenting his importance in the eyes of Mi&s;s Farnford, who &s;trove to attract his attention, and at la&s;t &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to engage him in a <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI> con|ver&s;ation, if &s;uch it could be called, partly compo&s;ed of tittering and whi&s;per|ing, of which Fanny and I were evi|dently the objects. Lady Farnford and Mrs. Hindon however atoned for their incivility, by be&s;towing on us their whole attention. The former, with the mo&s;t in&s;atiable curio&s;ity, endeavoured to penetrate into every circum&s;tance re|lating to our &s;ituation abroad, with an avidity which could not have been ex|cited without &s;ome previous information.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="253">I cautioned Mr. Howard on the &s;ub|ject of &s;ecre&s;y, and be&s;ought him to re|que&s;t his brother and Mrs. Hindon not to communicate our affairs out of their own family; but I fear it has not been at all ob&s;erved, for it was not difficult to perceive that we were regarded by the whole company with an eye of eager &s;crutiny, which denoted that we had been, according to a phra&s;e of Mrs. Hin|don's, <HI>on the carpet</HI> before we entered.</P>
<P>At table, the conver&s;ation was gene|ral: that is to &s;ay, it con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e common-place topics which neither greatly amu&s;e nor deeply intere&s;t, but which in a mixed company are taken up with &s;eeming eagerne&s;s merely <HI>pour pa&s;&s;er le tems.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hindon appears to be a good &s;ort of bluff Engli&s;h character, who can al|low neither of merit nor talents out of his own country, nor conceive any &s;ort of enjoyment out of this city, which he
<PB N="250" REF="254">
&s;ays he never quits even in &s;ummer, though he has a very fine villa within &s;ix miles of town. He is a banker, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large fortune, partly the fruits of his own indu&s;try, and partly brought him by his wife; from whom, being an heire&s;s, according to an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed form here, he al&s;o receives his name.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to enjoy good cheer with an extraordinary reli&s;h: dinner &s;erving equally for the purpo&s;es of conver&s;ation and refre&s;hment. The former, it indeed furni&s;hed abundantly; only varied by a di&s;&s;ertation on the different di&s;hes. I re|marked that Sir Jonathan, as well as Mr. Hindon, appeared to value them&s;elves extremely on tho&s;e qualities which more properly belonged to their cooks.</P>
<P>When the repa&s;t, which was &s;umptu|ous, was removed to make way for the de&s;ert, the younger part of the family, con&s;i&s;ting of two girls under ten years
<PB N="251" REF="255">
old and a boy about &s;ix, made their ap|pearance, and compleatly took place of the di&s;cour&s;e on cookery. The delighted parents in&s;tantly &s;hifting the topic to that of their children, related with eager &s;a|tisfaction their various improvements, accompli&s;hments, and di&s;po&s;itions, not forgetting the infantine bon mots of little Billy, whom &s;leep deprived us of the plea&s;ure of beholding.</P>
<P>I am my&s;elf &s;o extremely fond of children, that this conver&s;ation, had I been the only per&s;on pre&s;ent, might have entertained and even intere&s;ted me; but I could not help painfully feeling for its impropriety, which &s;o evidently fa|tigued in&s;tead of amu&s;ed the company on this occa&s;ion, that I pitied the blind|ne&s;s while I could not but admire the warmth of Mrs. Hindon's maternal ten|derne&s;s. Sir Jonathan indeed took little pains to conceal that he was heartily tired of the &s;ubject; but neither his repeated
<PB N="252" REF="256">
yawnings, nor con&s;tant attempts to change it, could induce the gratified parents to wander from a point which they concluded gave almo&s;t equal plea|&s;ure to their gue&s;ts and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When the ladies retired to tea and coffee, Fanny and I were again &s;ubjected to the inqui&s;itive interrogatories of Lady Farnford; which, as our &s;ituation is at pre&s;ent but in part revealed, extremely embarra&s;&s;ed me. That we had been edu|cated abroad, and never had vi&s;ited England before, I wi&s;hed not to con|ceal; but our rea&s;ons for leaving a &s;pot which had been &s;o long our home, and the &s;olitude in which we had been reared, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to divulge, and for many rea&s;ons I cho&s;e not to acknowledge, e&s;pecially to a per&s;on whom I had not been introduced to above a couple of hours before; yet Lady Farnford con|trived to penetrate into every circum|&s;tance
<PB N="253" REF="257">
with an eagerne&s;s which convinced me all was not perfectly new to her.</P>
<P>You received your education in a con|vent, I believe ladies? &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Yes, Madam.</P>
<P>Lord, cried the daughter, were you not afraid they would have made nuns of you?</P>
<P>We had no great rea&s;on to be alarmed as to that point, &s;aid I, for my father took infinite care to fortify us again&s;t all their attacks.</P>
<P>I fancy, re&s;umed the mother, <HI>home</HI> would not be much more lively than the mona&s;try, for I believe you lived <HI>re|tiredly</HI> enough. You &s;aw very little company I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Finding I only an&s;wered by a &s;imple affirmative, without growing in the lea&s;t communicative, &s;he turned to Fanny&mdash; It mu&s;t have been rather dull, I &s;hould imagine, to live in a manner &s;o &s;olitary, &s;o out of the world, with no &s;ociety but

merely that of the old gentleman your father?</P>
<P>Our governe&s;s, a mo&s;t amiable and re&s;pectable woman, &s;aid Fanny, died only four years ago; and &s;he was our con&s;tant companion while &s;he lived.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t have been very young when you lo&s;t her?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, my &s;i&s;ter was not then fourteen and I was &s;carcely twelve.</P>
<P>You got &s;ome one, I &s;hould imagine, to &s;upply her place?</P>
<P>None, Madam. My &s;i&s;ter was &s;oon after &s;ent to the convent for two years, and I was left &s;olely under my father's care till her return: for he took great pains him&s;elf in our improvement, and could not con&s;ent to deprive him&s;elf of both at one time.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t have appeared very di&s;|mal, &s;aid Lady Farnford. To be always in the country and to &s;ee nobody, mu&s;t
<PB N="255" REF="259">
be gloomy indeed at your time of life, for you had no &s;ociety I believe.</P>
<P>Oh! Madam, we never &s;aw a human creature; my father had no vi&s;itors, and never went a vi&s;iting him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Knowing that this was a &s;ubject on which Fanny would innocently expatiate, without con&s;idering its imprudence, I mentioned my beloved Sophia and her aunt, who, I &s;aid, &s;ometimes were &s;o kind as to enliven our &s;olitude with their vi&s;its, and in who&s;e company my father had once been prevailed on to allow me to &s;pend &s;ome weeks at the town of M&mdash;. I al&s;o &s;poke of Madame de Clarence, and did not forget Mr. Howard, who was indeed, though I did not own it, the only male vi&s;itor my father has had in my memory, Mr. Ben&s;eley excepted, whom I &s;carce recollect.</P>
<P>You, my Sophia, was a new &s;ource of inve&s;tigation and curio&s;ity. Who was this Mi&s;s Beaumont? where had I got
<PB N="256" REF="260">
acquainted with her? When I an&s;wered that &s;he had been my favorite friend at the convent, that we had received our education together, and that &s;he was only daughter and heire&s;s to Sir Edward Beaumont, who&s;e name and public em|ployment could not be unknown to her, I a&s;&s;ure you my importance &s;eemed not a little encrea&s;ed by the information.</P>
<P>The appearance of the gentlemen, I was in hopes, would have relieved me from this embarra&s;&s;ing conver&s;ation: but Lady Farnford was determined it &s;hould not drop &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>My dear, cried &s;he to her hu&s;band, the&s;e ladies have been entertaining us mightily. They have been telling us all about their manner of living abroad; and that the old gentleman their father was of a mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary humour. He hardly ever allowed of the young ladies leaving home, and ne|ver permitted a man to enter his doors.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="261">This &s;peech, which implied that we had been complaining of this la&s;t circum|&s;tance as a peculiar hard&s;hip, put me extremely out of countenance, and in|&s;tantly drew the eyes of the gentlemen towards us: but Mr. Howard relieved my awkwardne&s;s by &s;aying that Mr. Sey|mour was indeed uncommonly fond of retirement, yet at the &s;ame time &s;o warmly attached and indulgent to his children, that he would mo&s;t willingly have allowed them what &s;ociety they cho&s;e, had not their duty and affection induced them with plea&s;ure to conform to a way of life which they knew was agreeable to his ta&s;te.</P>
<P>What could his intention be Mi&s;s, &s;aid Sir Jonathan, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, in burying you alive in that manner? Certainly he never could expect to get you off his hands at that rate; at lea&s;t his method was rather extraordinary. For my part I think it is a piece of in|ju&s;tice
<PB N="258" REF="262">
to &s;hut up girls like birds in a cage. Let them &s;ee and be &s;een, and take their chance in the matrimonial lot|tery like others: one mu&s;t not expect now-a-days that our daughters will be courted by proxy on the report of their beauty. There's Bet&s;ey now&mdash;I hope to live to &s;ee her happily &s;ettled; but I &s;hould not think I performed my duty to the girl, if I &s;hut her up always at home, where &s;he would have no oppor|tunity of making a good creditable &s;et|tlement.</P>
<P>It was not ea&s;y to find an an&s;wer to this &s;peech, which was entirely addre&s;&s;ed to me, and I did not attempt it. I felt however for his daughter, who I con|cluded mu&s;t be equally &s;hocked with its rude indelicacy; you may then gue&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment, when I heard her &s;ay, in|wardly &s;peaking, but without the lea&s;t appearance of ba&s;hfulne&s;s&mdash;Indeed I &s;hould not think it at all fair.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="263">The whole company &s;taid &s;upper; and as whi&s;t was the game, of which Fanny and I are entirely ignorant and we de|clined any other, Sir Jonathan and Lady Farnford and Mr. and Mrs. Hindon made a party; Mi&s;s Farnford, the Cap|tain, and Fanny, having &s;eated them|&s;elves on a &s;opha, &s;oon after entered into chat together, in which Mr. Howard joined. As for me, I was placed by the card players; and though more in a con|templative than talkative humour, (for indeed I was anxiou&s;ly revolving in my mind the &s;ucce&s;s of the letter to Lady Linro&s;e,) yet &s;eeing Mi&s;s Jenny take up her work, and &s;it down at the farther end of the room as if unwilling to intrude on the conver&s;ation, I took that opportunity of te&s;tifying that I did not regard her in the mortifying point of view which &s;eemed &s;o unfeelingly to influence the re&s;t of the company; and &s;hifting my &s;eat in order to join her, endeavoured to
<PB N="260" REF="264">
conquer the di&s;tance and re&s;erve with which &s;he kept her&s;elf unconnected with tho&s;e from whom &s;he only expected in|delicacy and ill breeding.</P>
<P>She appeared much gratified with my attention, and received it with a degree of mode&s;ty which evinced &s;he had not always been accu&s;tomed even to com|mon politene&s;s. We conver&s;ed together till &s;upper was announced; and I found &s;omething, both in her &s;entiments and manner of expre&s;&s;ing them, &s;uperior to what I perceived in any of the re&s;t of the party.</P>
<P>I am afraid my Sophia will conclude I am growing cen&s;orious upon entering the world; but to an eye unaccu&s;tomed to a mixture of characters, and where all the errors and ab&s;urdities of &s;ociety are entirely new, a thou&s;and faults and im|perfections mu&s;t appear, which habit conceals and acquaintance renders too familiar for ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="265">To this I make no doubt it is in a great mea&s;ure owing, that I find my&s;elf &s;o early di&s;gu&s;ted by Mrs. Hindon's man|ners, for I own I am infinitely di&s;ap|pointed; probably the more poignantly from the &s;anguine di&s;po&s;ition with which I fir&s;t met her. We were &s;trangers and unknown to her; and her benevolence in offering us an a&s;ylum be&s;poke &s;uch hu|manity and goodne&s;s of heart, that I in|&s;tantly in my own mind adopted her for a friend, and received her fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s with that gratitude and en|thu&s;ia&s;m, which her civility undoubtedly &s;till merits, but which it is now no lon|ger in my power &s;o warmly to be&s;tow. Fir&s;t &s;ight impre&s;&s;ions I confe&s;s are ex|tremely fallacious; yet I am much mi&s;|taken if Mrs. Hindon po&s;&s;e&s;e&s;es either that delicacy or good &s;en&s;e, which, if they in|habit the mind &s;eldom fail to throw &s;ome lu&s;tre over the manners, however unpo|li&s;hed
<PB N="262" REF="266">
by &s;ociety or a knowledge of the polite world.</P>
<P>I was particularly &s;hocked by her be|haviour to this poor girl. Nothing cer|tainly di&s;covers littlene&s;s of mind &s;o evi|dently as in&s;olence to inferiors, or to tho&s;e whom calamities have rendered dependent on us. As we &s;at together, I expre&s;&s;ed my apprehen&s;ions that our intended vi&s;it was the occa&s;ion of hurrying her away from Mrs. Hindon's &s;ooner than was her original intention; but before &s;he could reply, Mrs. Hindon overhearing me, an|&s;wered &mdash;Oh never think of that, Mi&s;s Seymour. I dare &s;ay Jenny her&s;elf would be very unwilling to &s;tand in the way of my convenience. We can ea&s;ily procure her an apartment at Mrs. Bret's the man|tua makers, for &s;ome weeks, and as we are at the expence of her lodgings, it is all one to her: be&s;ides it is ju&s;t in the corner of the &s;treet, and &s;he will eat here;
<PB N="263" REF="267">
&s;o that I give you my word the honour of your company will not occa&s;ion the &s;lighte&s;t inconvenience. I only wi&s;h to have a day or two given me afterwards, that things may be made proper for your reception, and then I &s;hall be quite af|fronted if you refu&s;e to favour me &s;o far.</P>
<P>The extreme gro&s;ne&s;s of this &s;peech, which &s;o unfeelingly di&s;covered Mi&s;s Jenny's dependance, made her hang down her head in confu&s;ion; and I felt her mortification &s;o &s;everely, that I in|&s;i&s;ted on remaining in our pre&s;ent lodg|ings in preference to occa&s;ioning her re|moval.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon however &s;oon contrived to carry her point by rendering me quite incapable of arguing on the &s;ubject. You don't con&s;ider, my dear Mi&s;s Seymour, cried &s;he, how &s;candal flies in this town. What will not people &s;ay to &s;ee two fine young girls of your figure re&s;iding in lodgings, without the protection either
<PB N="264" REF="268">
of a father, a hu&s;band, or a brother. I make no doubt but that Mr. Howard here would be exceedingly happy to act in the capacity of one of the&s;e relations; but till he proves his title, added &s;he, (laughing immoderately at the confu&s;ion into which both her brother-in-law and we were thrown by this hint) you'll be charitably taken for a connection of a dif|ferent kind.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard even blu&s;hed at her inde|licacy; but &s;aid, with an air of mingled dignity and gravity, that he &s;hould be happy in performing any &s;ervices to us which might manife&s;t his friend&s;hip for my father, and the &s;en&s;e he &s;hould ever po&s;&s;e&s;s of the obligations he owed him.</P>
<P>There I don't doubt you, returned Mrs. Hindon, &s;miling with a &s;ly look, and I hope the young ladies may rely on your good offices upon <HI>their own account</HI> as well as their father's.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf they do, &s;aid he, with
<PB N="265" REF="269">
re&s;erve, though much embarra&s;&s;ed by his facetious &s;i&s;ter in law's ill judged raillery.</P>
<P>Before we departed, Lady Farnford and her daughter came up, and expre&s;&s;ed in warm terms their good fortune in hav|ing been introduced to our acquaintance, hoped it would prove the forerunner of a cordial intimacy, and a&s;&s;ured us they &s;hould not fail to wait on us as &s;oon as it was in their power.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hindon, who is indeed extreme|ly kind, tho' I could wi&s;h it were attend|ed with a little more &s;oftne&s;s, called a|gain this morning, and was hardly &s;eated when Lady Farnford and her daughter were announced.</P>
<P>The latter on entering ha&s;tily bru&s;hed by her mother, and &s;haking both Fanny and I by the hand with the familiarity and freedom due to old acquaintances, exclaimed&mdash;I am quite happy to &s;ee you
<PB N="266" REF="270">
both. I a&s;&s;ure you mama has done no|thing but prai&s;e you &s;o as you can't think &s;ince la&s;t night, and we ordered the coach as &s;oon as we had done breakfa&s;t, in order to wait on you, to reque&s;t that you would favour us with your company to the play, if you are not engaged on Wedne&s;day next. Mrs. Siddons is to appear in Belvidera. All the world will be there; and as we have engaged places, I hope you will certainly accompany us.</P>
<P>Lady Farnford joining in the reque&s;t, we con&s;ented, altho' I do not much wi&s;h to appear in public, till we know on what footing we are to be introduced.</P>
<P>To-day we have &s;pent at home, and entirely by our&s;elves, which the two la|dies regretted as a calamity their polite|ne&s;s would undoubtedly have prevented, had not previous engagements put it out of their power. Mr. Howard has been from home too mo&s;t part of the day, em|ployed

<P>Mr. Howard is ju&s;t come in. With his accu&s;tomed kindne&s;s, he has been making enquiries I find re&s;pecting the &s;ituations and di&s;po&s;itions of our neare&s;t relations, with the view of being enabled to judge from which of them we are like|ly to receive the mo&s;t cordial reception. But tho' he does not wi&s;h to rai&s;e a pre|judice in our minds again&s;t my uncle's family, he has been con&s;trained to ac|knowledge, that with the exception of his &s;econd &s;on, (who is high in the world's e&s;timation,) they are not generally be|loved.</P>
<P>Tho' of acknowledged probity and honor, a vain pa&s;&s;ion for &s;tate and parade ob&s;cures their good qualities, and renders
<PB N="268" REF="272">
their &s;ociety &s;o &s;hackled with o&s;tentatious ceremonials, that it is very little either courted or de&s;ired. Lady Linro&s;e in particular exacts an homage on account of her rank, which is beheld with ridi|cule and granted with reluctance, of cour&s;e out of a very general acquaintance &s;he enjoys the ble&s;&s;ing of but few friends.</P>
<P>My uncle and her Lady&s;hip, it &s;eems, had lived &s;eparate for &s;ome years previ|ous to his death. He was a man of a very violent, untractable di&s;po&s;ition, and his lady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that mild compli|ance of temper that could &s;ubmit to the head&s;trong humour of her hu&s;band. Lord Belmont, it is &s;aid, approved of and even advi&s;ed the &s;eparation, and has pre&s;erved for her Lady&s;hip a re&s;pect and regard which leads the world to exculpate her from the &s;hare of blame that u&s;ually in &s;imilar in&s;tances involves in &s;ome mea|&s;ure both parties.</P>

Mr. Howard is told died about a twelve month ago. She had buried her hu&s;band &s;ome years before, and has left no family.

<P>HAVING di&s;patched my la&s;t packet, Fanny and I were preparing to leave the parlour the other night, it being late, and Mr. Howard having already retired to bed, when the door was &s;uddenly opened
<PB N="270" REF="274">
and two young men, &s;eemingly intoxi|cated and di&s;ordered, ha&s;tily entered the room, as if quite at home. Upon &s;eeing it occupied, they a&s;ked pardon for their intru&s;ion. They did not however at|tempt to repair it, by leaving the apart|ment, but &s;tood &s;ome minutes endeavour|ing to excu&s;e them&s;elves on the &s;core of having mi&s;taken it for another, which it &s;eems one of them at pre&s;ent inhabits in this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The wildne&s;s of their looks, and the elaborate length of their apology, led me in&s;tantly to &s;u&s;pect that the mi&s;take was not unintentional, e&s;pecially as the part of the hou&s;e which we have taken is per|fectly di&s;tinct from that engaged by other lodgers. I recollected be&s;ides that I had more than once remarked, &s;ince our a|bode here, that as we pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;tairs a face from the door of one of the rooms u&s;ed to peep out as if anxious to get a &s;ight of us, and concluded, from the be|haviour
<PB N="271" REF="275">
of the&s;e gentlemen, that know|ing there were two young women under the &s;ame roof with them, they had been &s;eized with curio&s;ity to &s;ee us, and in a &s;tate of intoxication had ventured to in|troduce them&s;elves in this rude and a|brupt manner.</P>
<P>Frightened by the bold way in which they &s;tared at us, I curt&s;eyed with a very grave air, and told them the mi&s;take was of no con&s;equence, expecting them to depart. This however they had no in|tention of doing &s;o immediately.</P>
<P>Since Fortune has proved &s;o kind, &s;aid one of them, who appeared the mo&s;t in|toxicated, &s;ince Fortune, has &s;o wonder|fully &s;avoured us with the knowledge that two &s;uch angels exi&s;t, let us not fail to profit from the ble&s;t occa&s;ion. Per|mit me the honour ladies of introducing this gentleman to the happine&s;s of your acquaintance, (pulling his friend by the arm, who, half a&s;hamed of his &s;ituation,
<PB N="272" REF="276">
had &s;hrunk behind)&mdash;Tom Brad&s;haw, Ma'am, (bowing,) he is mode&s;t you may perceive, but as worthy a fellow as lives.</P>
<P>My embarra&s;&s;ment and a&s;toni&s;hment at this effrontery in an utter &s;tranger may ea&s;ily be conjectured. I knew not what reply to make to a &s;peech and behaviour &s;o unaccountably forward and pre&s;uming, but &s;tood with a &s;urpri&s;e and gravity in my countenance &s;ufficient I hoped to have confounded them, had they been capable of confu&s;ion after &s;uch a frolic.</P>
<P>Come Tom, continued he, do me the &s;ame favour with the ladies: introduce me to the&s;e divinities, who have kindly conde&s;cended to inhabit this our terre&s;|trial abode.</P>
<P>His companion however, who&s;e facul|ties were either le&s;s impaired or who did not naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s that degree of happy a&s;&s;urance with which the other &s;eemed ble&s;t, becoming now thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the error he had committed, and hear|tily
<PB N="273" REF="277">
a&s;hamed of his friend's behaviour, exclaimed&mdash;This is too much, Jack; let us be gone. Ladies, I am perfectly athamed&mdash;I blu&s;h&mdash;to have&mdash;to have in|truded &s;o rudely; and &s;tammering out a very awkward apology, endeavourer to di&s;engage him&s;elf from his friend, who held him by the arm, &s;wearing that he would not &s;uffer him to leave the ladies &s;o abruptly.</P>
<P>Terrified at the bu&s;tle they began to create, I ha&s;tily exclaimed, for heaven's &s;ake gentlemen leave us. Con&s;ider we have not the plea&s;ure of knowing you. I then looked around in vain for the bell, but perceived there was none in the room, and I was too much intimidated to dare acknowledge my fears, by mak|ing an attempt to e&s;cape, which would probably have proved fruitle&s;s, as they had &s;hut the door and flood them&s;elves almo&s;t before it.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="278">Fanny, tho' in general rather timid, could not witne&s;s this &s;cene without feel|ing more entertained than frightened. The extreme ab&s;urdity of the two gen|tlemen's conduct, and the awkwardne&s;s of my a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;truck her &s;o forci|bly, that in &s;pite of her apprehen&s;ions &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t giving way to a violent and childi&s;h fit of laughing; the bad con|&s;equences of which &s;oon appeared &s;o evi|dent, as to put a &s;peedy period to mirth &s;o mal apropos.</P>
<P>Nay if you are for a frolic ladies, cried the gentleman who, had hitherto pre&s;erv|ed the mo&s;t decorum, &s;uddenly turning round and joining heartily in the laugh, I'm your man.</P>
<P>Oh! cried the other, I knew they were dear little kind devils, and advancing to Fanny, was going to throw his arms a|round her, when a &s;udden emotion of uncontroulable terror made us both utter atone in&s;tant a loud &s;cream and fly to the
<PB N="275" REF="279">
door, which the gentlemen were too much intimidated to prevent our opening; and the landlady, and There&s;e both appearing, they retired in ha&s;te to their own apart|ment, while Fanny and I, breathle&s;s with fear, did not for an hour recover our u&s;ual compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mrs. Brumpton, our landlady, who is a decent, &s;en&s;ible looking woman, then informed us that only one of the gentle|men lodged in her hou&s;e, and the other, who by our account of his audacity &s;he a&s;&s;ured us could not be Captain Brad|&s;haw, was one of his friends who often vi&s;ited him.</P>
<P>Her lodger, &s;he &s;aid, was a gentleman of the belt character, &s;weet tempered, and extremely generous, and had never been, guilty of &s;uch a riot in her hou&s;e &s;ince he had lived with her; &s;he therefore imagined his pre&s;ent freedom mu&s;t have entirely proceeded from inebriety, as in|deed the other gentleman his friend was
<PB N="276" REF="280">
but too much giVen to that fault, and might have led him into it, and &s;he was certain Captain Brad&s;haw would be quite di&s;tre&s;&s;ed when he reflected on his mi&s;be|haviour to two <HI>&s;uch ladies.</HI></P>
<P>She afterwards added, that having got a glymp&s;e of us one day on the &s;tairs, he had been &s;o much &s;truck, as &s;he called it, that he had often entreated her to contrive &s;ome means of &s;eeing us for a longer time, but that &s;he had told him that was a favour he mu&s;t owe to chance alone, as &s;he could not pre&s;ume to intro|duce him.</P>
<P>I told Mrs. Brumpton that intoxica|tion, (a bad apology for any tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion,) afforded no &s;ort of ju&s;tification for rudene&s;s like his, and that I &s;hould mo&s;t undoubtedly take effectual means to pre|vent a repetition of the &s;ame offence, by applying next day to Mr. Howard, who would talk to the young men on the &s;ub|ject without delay.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="281">This was le&s;s my intention at the time than meant as a threat to be repeated from Mr. Brumpton's lips to her lodger; tho' I had re&s;olved, in the heat of my re&s;entment, not con&s;idering the con&s;e|quences, to inform Mr. Howard of our affront and to reque&s;t his interference: but a moment's reflection had changed this re&s;olution; and the good woman re|pre&s;ented &s;o &s;trongly the ri&s;que attending engaging two gentlemen in a quarrel, that I determined never to mention it to him unle&s;s I had rea&s;on to dread the con|tinuance of a &s;imilar conduct.</P>
<P>Next morning our landlady brought us an apology couched in the mo&s;t re|&s;pectful terms, from the Captain, entreat|ing our forgivene&s;s for our la&s;t night's alarm. As I was &s;omewhat afraid of his encroachments after &s;uch audacious behaviour, we took no further notice of his me&s;&s;age than to tell Mrs. Brumpton that while her lodger made no attempts
<PB N="278" REF="282">
to force him&s;elf on our acquaintance we &s;hould think of the pa&s;t no more.</P>
<P>All ye&s;terday and the day before Mrs. Hindon was confined with a bad cold, yet &s;he was &s;o kind as to reque&s;t our com|pany; but we declined it, from the idea that politene&s;s alone could have induced her when ill to &s;olicit it.</P>
