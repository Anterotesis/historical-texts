<HEAD>APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<Q><P>CRITICISM has &s;o often given occa&s;ion to the envious and ill-natured of gratifying their malignity, that &s;ome have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to recommend the virtue of candour without re&s;triction, and to preclude all future liberty of cen|&s;ure. Writers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this opi|nion, are continually enforcing civility and decency, recommending to criticks the proper diffidence of them&s;elves, and inculcating the veneration due to cele|brated names.</P>
<P>I am not of opinion that the&s;e profe&s;&s;ed enemies of arrogance, and &s;everity, have much more benevolence or mode&s;ty than the re&s;t of mankind; or that they feel in their own hearts, any other intentions
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
than to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy. Some are mode&s;t becau&s;e they are timorous, and &s;ome are lavi&s;h of prai&s;e, becau&s;e they hope to be repaid.</P>
<P>There is indeed &s;ome tenderne&s;s due to living writers, when they attack none of tho&s;e truths which are of importance to the happine&s;s of mankind, and have com|mitted no other offence, than that of be|traying their own ignorance or dulne&s;s. I &s;hould think it cruelty to cru&s;h an in|&s;ect, who had provoked me only by buz|zing in my ear, and would not willingly interrupt the dream of harmle&s;s &s;tupi|dity, or de&s;troy the je&s;t which makes its author laugh. Yet I am far from think|ing this tenderne&s;s univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary; for he that writes may be con&s;idered as a kind of general challenger, whom every one has a right to attack; &s;ince he quits the common rank of life, &s;teps forward beyond the li&s;ts, and offers his merit to the publick judgment. To commence author, is to claim prai&s;e, and no man can ju&s;tly a&s;pire to honour, but at the hazard of di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The faults of a writer of acknow|ledged excellence, are more dangerous, becau&s;e the influence of his example is
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
more exten&s;ive; and the intere&s;t of learn|ing requires that they &s;hould be di&s;cover|ed and &s;tigmatized, before they have the &s;anction of antiquity conferred on them, and become precedents of indi&s;putable authority.</P>
<P>The duty of <HI>critici&s;m</HI> is neither to de|preciate, nor dignify by partial repre&s;en|tations, but to hold out the light of REA|SON, <HI>whatever it may di&s;cover;</HI> and to pro|mulgate the determinations of TRUTH, <HI>whatever &s;he &s;hall dictate.</HI></P></Q>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING acquired a kind of friend&s;hip for the brave Cor&s;icans, from the peru&s;al of your in|tere&s;ting account of their &s;ituation, manners, and principles, I could not fail of being greatly affected by the mi&s;take into which your zeal for the welfare of that heroic people, and the honour of Paoli, their general, &s;eems precipitately to have hurried you.</P>
<P>The admiration which pur&s;ues celebrity, is in|deed &s;o very univer&s;al, that I am not &s;urprized a veneration for illu&s;trious names &s;hould prevail even to enthu&s;ia&s;m in young and unexperienced minds. Perhaps this veneration is no le&s;s amiable in its cau&s;e, than exceptionable in its effects. As it is generally corrected by age and ob&s;ervation, it were
<PB N="2" REF="6">
a pity, therefore, to hurt a &s;u&s;ceptible and inge|nuous mind, by too rudely attempting to eradicate &s;o natural a &s;entiment, while confined to the brea&s;t of the individual <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>For as the RAMBLER mo&s;t accurately ob&s;erves, N^o. 122, Experience &s;oon &s;hews us the tortuo&s;ities of imaginary recti|tude, the complications of &s;implicity, and the a&s;perities of &s;moothne&s;s.</Q> It was for this rea&s;on &s;ome common friends were de&s;irous of my &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, ob&s;erving of Mr. Bo&s;well, as he tells us, the Cor&s;icans did of a young French Marquis, who once like him vi&s;ited their i&s;land, and gave him&s;elf prodigious airs of con&s;equence; to all which tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible people made no reply, but, beholding him with a &s;mile of ridicule, &s;aid, <Q>Let him alone, he is young <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tour to Cor&s;ica, fir&s;t edition, page 316.</NOTE>.</Q> Our friends might be in the right, but the rea&s;ons above-mentioned prevailed.</NOTE>. But when a public di&s;play of it renders its puerility con&s;picuous; when the &s;allies of youth and inexperience are obtruded on the world as the dictates of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, it becomes a nece&s;&s;ary, I will &s;ay a friendly ta&s;k, to make a di&s;tinction between the giddy flights of a loo&s;e and bewildered fancy, and the &s;ober re&s;earches of &s;olid &s;en&s;e and profound penetration.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who exalt trifles by immoderate prai&s;e, are to be ranked among the perverters of rea&s;on and corrupters of the world, I am afraid you have not been &s;ufficiently attentive to the general obli|gation of mankind to promote happine&s;s and vir|tue, <Q>in being careful not to mi&s;lead unwary minds, by appearing to &s;et too high a value upon things by which no real excellence is conferred.</Q></P>
<P>I doubt not, Sir, that time and reflection will correct many of tho&s;e mi&s;taken notions you at pre|&s;ent entertain of men and manners in general, as well as of your illu&s;trious friends in particular; I
<PB N="3" REF="7">
&s;hould therefore have &s;pared both you and my&s;elf the trouble of this addre&s;s, had the propagation of &s;uch notions been confined to the circle of your per&s;onal acquaintance. But when we &s;ee them di&s;|&s;eminated in printed books throughout Europe; when we &s;ee the morals, and con&s;equently the poli|tical happine&s;s of a whole nation endangered by your indi&s;creet and officious endeavours to promote their unnece&s;&s;ary reformation; who can with-hold remon&s;trance! <HI>Quum tota in&s;ula periclitatur, non ex|po&s;tulemus? non accu&s;emus? non graviter feramus?</HI>&mdash;Truth, ju&s;tice, humanity forbid it.</P>
<P>You have been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure the world, that the Cor&s;icans are arrived at that <Q>period in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, in which mankind appear to the greate&s;t advantage.</Q> You have been plea&s;ed to tell us, <Q>they are bold, active, &s;teady, ardent in the love of liberty and their native country: that their manners are &s;imple, their &s;ocial affec|tions warm, and though they are greatly influ|enced by the ties of blood, yet they are generous, ho&s;pitable, and religious <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tour to Cor&s;ica, fir&s;t edit. p. 308.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Of the character and &s;entiments of their illu&s;tri|ous chief, you give us al&s;o an idea, worthy the leader of &s;uch a nation; a nation compo&s;ed of men of <Q>honour, &s;en&s;e and abilities.</Q></P>
<P>Little did I imagine a people &s;o circum&s;tanced, under the conduct of a chief &s;o amiable and &s;o en|lightened, could &s;tand in need of either the moral or political reveries of &s;peculative theori&s;ts of other nations <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For as you ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, <Q>the natural and divine prero|gatives of liberty need not the aid of logick, which has been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed by the advocates for &s;lavery, <HI>to dark|en coun&s;el by words without knowledge.</HI></Q> Account of Cor&s;ica, p. 199.</NOTE>? Yet are you farther plea&s;ed to inform
<PB N="4" REF="8">
us, that diverted with the &s;canty library of the Cor|&s;ican general, you have &s;ent him over &s;ome Engli&s;h books in favour of <HI>Liberty;</HI> as al&s;o &s;ome of our <HI>be&s;t books of Morality,</HI> particularly the works of Mr. Samuel John&s;on; who&s;e name you revere, of who&s;e &s;apience you are always mindful, and whom you magnificently &s;tile a maje&s;tick teacher of moral and religious wi&s;dom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tour to Cor&s;ica, p. 298.33<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 177.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>Would to God, Sir, you had left the General's library as bare as you found it! or that you had timely con&s;idered the nature and tendency of the fatal gift you were going to make him!</P>
<P>It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, from the &s;uperlative re|gard you pro&s;e&s;s for the two celebrated per&s;onages ju&s;t mentioned, that you intended your literary pre|&s;ent &s;hould be as u&s;eful to the one as honourable to the other. You doubtle&s;s conceived the writings of our Engli&s;h philo&s;opher would &s;erve either to confirm, or inform, the mind of the Cor&s;ican pa|triot; and by his means to edify the minds, and improve the morals of the whole Cor&s;ican nation.</P>
<P>Had the principles of both been the &s;ame indeed, tho&s;e of Paoli might be confirmed by a knowledge of their coincidence; pre&s;uming always on that Chief's implicit acceptation of the exalted character you gave him of Dr. John&s;on. Nay, were they different, without being very e&s;&s;entially &s;o, Paoli might po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubmit to be corrected by the more accurate judgment of a man, who&s;e comprehen|&s;ive and vigorous under&s;tanding, you could have

a&s;&s;ured him, has by long ob&s;ervation attained to a perfect knowledge of human nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tour to Cor&s;ica, p. 330.</NOTE>. But if, as it really happens, they &s;hould be found totally in|compatible; if neither Paoli nor his Cor&s;icans can po&s;&s;ibly adopt the &s;entiments of Dr. John&s;on, with|out entirely dive&s;ting them&s;elves of their own, they would by &s;o doing, make the mo&s;t perilous ex|change imaginable. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how eventually fatal your well-intended gift may prove to that now happy country: for happy will I call a people, &s;uch as you have de&s;cribed the Cor&s;icans; a people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every patriot and dome&s;tic virtue <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They have indeed, tho' naturally humane, an unlucky cu&s;tom of &s;tabbing one another now and then, on &s;u&s;picion of cuckoldom; which cu&s;tom, &s;ays Mr. Bo&s;well, <Q>may to &s;ome appear rude and barbarous; but I hold it to be wi&s;e and noble. Better occa&s;ional murders, than frequent adulteries.</Q> See Account of Cor&s;ica, p. 133. and 217.</NOTE>, and glorying in the faire&s;t pro&s;|pects of a political happine&s;s inferior to nothing but that which they now enjoy.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of more poli&s;hed and luxurious countries may pique them&s;elves on their enjoy|ment of a greater &s;hare of &s;uch happine&s;s: but, their vanity deceives them; and I may, on your own authority, &s;afely venture to call the Cor&s;icans the happie&s;t nation in the world. In which ca&s;e, I dread to think what may be the con&s;equence of a total perver&s;ion of their pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of morals.</P>
<P>Better, far better might it have been for them, as a nation, that they had ri&s;ked the contagion of a corporal plague, by the importation of a bale of cotton from Aleppo, than to catch the infection
<PB N="6" REF="10">
of a &s;entimental pe&s;tilence, by that of a bale of books from the port of London.</P>
<P>But, to wave declamation, and prove that my fears are not more imaginary than your inadver|tency hath been real.</P>
<P>This cannot be more impartially effected, than by di&s;playing the moral characters and &s;entiments of your two friends, the celebrated per&s;onages abovementioned, in a comparative point of view. I &s;hall begin therefore with the Cor&s;ican chief, as de&s;cribed by your own pen.</P>

<HEAD>MORAL CHARACTER AND SENTIMENTS OF SAMUEL JOHNSON.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His notions of morality are low and gro&s;s: &s;uch as would ill become a friar in a convent.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="8" REF="12">2. He hath &s;o mean a conception of virtue in theory, as to think the little there is of it in the world, is chiefly the effect of human mi&s;ery. So far from conceiving, with Paoli, that virtue is the food of our hearts, he de&s;cribes mankind in gene|ral, as naturally prone to every vice; and as hav|ing no &s;en&s;e even of common ju&s;tice, but what they acquire from their &s;uffering by the inju&s;tice of one another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Idler, N^o. 89. from which all the following pa&s;|&s;ages de&s;criptive of this pretended philo&s;opher's character are taken.</NOTE>.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. How often, he has deviated from the prac|tice of virtue, he hath not told us; but he declares that the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind naturally lead them to licentious plea&s;ures, and that their rea&s;on hath no authority over them, but by its power to warn them again&s;t evil; &s;o that unle&s;s vice was check|ed by mi&s;ery, it would &s;well to univer&s;al and un|limited dominion.&mdash;In a world like ours, &s;ays he, where our &s;en&s;es a&s;&s;ault us, and our hearts betray us, we &s;hould pa&s;s on from crime to crime, heed|le&s;s and remor&s;ele&s;s, if mi&s;ery did not &s;tand in our way, and our own pains admoni&s;h us of our folly.&mdash;And again, If neither di&s;ea&s;e nor poverty were &s;elt or dreaded, every one would &s;ink down in idle &s;en&s;uality, without any care of others or him|&s;elf. To eat and drink, and iie down to &s;leep, would be the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind!</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He pro&s;e&s;&s;es in the decline of life, &s;uch an irrational and &s;lavi&s;h &s;y&s;tem of piety, that he de|&s;cribes the regular di&s;charge of the duties of reli|gion, as the con&s;trained and involuntary occupation of infancy or dotage. In manhood, he tells us, religion and piety are neglected. None, &s;ays he,
<PB N="9" REF="13">
would have recour&s;e to an invi&s;ible power, but that all other &s;ubjects had eluded their hopes. The gloom of age which intercepts our pro&s;pects of long enjoyment, forces us to fix our hopes on an|other &s;tate; and when we have contended with the tempe&s;ts of life till our &s;trength fails us, we fly at la&s;t to the &s;helter of religion.&mdash;Hence it is that he lives in a &s;tate of con&s;tant doubt, di&s;tru&s;t and de|&s;pondency.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He is &s;o unju&s;tly di&s;&s;atisfied with the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of providence, that he conceives the only thinking being of this globe, is doomed to think merely to be wretched, and to pa&s;s his time from youth to age in nothing but fearing or &s;uffering calamities. Nay, he in&s;inuates that the ble&s;&s;ings of providence tend immediately to corrupt us; and affirms that none would fix their attention on a future &s;tate, but that they are di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He is at no time a hero, and has not a mind fitted either for philo&s;ophical &s;peculations, or af|fairs of &s;tate.</ITEM>

<P>Such is the patriot Paoli, and &s;uch the philo&s;o|pher John&s;on!

In doing this, I &s;hall take the liberty al&s;o of making &s;ome occa&s;ional remarks on the vera|city, con&s;i&s;tency and tendency of the po&s;itions ad|vanced, &s;o far as they are applicable either to Mr. Bo&s;well, Dr. John&s;on, Paoli or his Cor&s;icans.</P>

<HEAD>The IDLER, N^o LXXXIX.</HEAD>
<Q>How evil came into the world; for what rea&s;on it is that life is over&s;pread with &s;uch boundle&s;s va|rieties of mi&s;ery; why the only thinking being of this globe is doomed to think merely to be wretched, and to pa&s;s his time from youth to age in fearing or in &s;uffering calamities, is a que&s;tion which philo&s;ophers have long a&s;ked, and which philo&s;ophy could never an&s;wer.</Q>
<P>The reality of this mi&s;erable ca&s;e, is yet piou&s;ly taken for granted. But it is notorious that philo|&s;ophers have been frequently employed in the inve&s;|tigation of cau&s;es, who&s;e effects exi&s;ted only in their own di&s;tempered imaginations.</P>
<P>Our Idler &s;hould therefore have proved, his in|&s;inuations true, viz. that man is the only thinking Being of this globe; and even then, that he was
<PB N="11" REF="15">
doomed to think merely to be wretched, before he had entered upon an enquiry, why or how he be|came &s;o. The in&s;inuation it&s;elf, however, is &s;uf|ficient to give the reader &s;ome idea of the writer's temper and di&s;po&s;ition, and to rai&s;e a &s;u&s;picion at lea&s;t that he may be one of that &s;pecies of beings in human form, which he hath him&s;elf, not improperly marked out as the &s;creech-owls of mankind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The&s;e &s;creech-owls &s;eem to be &s;ettled in an opinion that the great bu&s;ine&s;s of life is to complain, and that they were born for no other purpo&s;e than to di&s;turb the happine&s;s of others, to le&s;&s;en the little comforts, and &s;horten the &s;hort plea|&s;ures of our condition, by painful remembrances of the pa&s;t, or melancholy progno&s;ticks of the future; their only care is to cru&s;h the ri&s;ing hope, to damp the kindling tran&s;port and al|lay the golden hours of gaiety with the hateful dro&s;s of grief and &s;u&s;picion."

<P>Now whether your friend chu&s;es to relinqui&s;h or abide by the &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tem, you certainly mu&s;t own him to be one of tho&s;e rea&s;oners, on whom the name of philo&s;opher has been too ea&s;ily conferred <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall not take on me here either to defend or oppo&s;e this &s;el|fi&s;h &s;y&s;tem, of which your friend &s;eems to entertain &s;uch un&s;ettled ideas.

<P>Nothing but your partiality at lea&s;t can po&s;&s;ibly prevent it, when I quote the words immediately following; in which this <HI>affection merely &s;elfi&s;h,</HI> is called <Q>an involuntary perception of pain at the involuntary &s;ight of a being like our&s;elves lan|gui&s;hing in mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P>Now the philo&s;ophers, who tell us we mu&s;t re|nounce the theory which accounts for moral &s;enti|ments by the principle of <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> adopt this very involuntary fellow-feeling for others. They call it not a &s;elfi&s;h but a &s;ocial affection, and affirm that the welfare of others, even on their own account is not indifferent to us. They do not repre&s;ent com|pa&s;&s;ion as a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;ing from a retro&s;pect to our&s;elves, but allow that every thing which con|tributes

<Q>'Tis needle&s;s, &s;ay they, to pu&s;h our re&s;ear|ches &s;o far as to a&s;k why we have humanity or a fellow-feeling for others.

<P>Whatever principles we adopt, however, they ought to be con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; nor can he po&s;&s;ibly have a mind fitted for philo&s;ophical &s;peculations, who thus confounds the principles of others, and contradicts his own.</P>
<Q><HI>GODLINESS,</HI> or piety, is elevation of the mind towards the &s;upreme being, and exten&s;ion of the thoughts to another life. The other life is future, and the &s;upreme being is invi&s;ible. None would have recour&s;e to an invi&s;ible power, but that all other &s;ubjects had eluded their hopes. None would fix their attention upon the future, but that they are di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent. If the &s;en&s;es were fea&s;ted with perpetual plea&s;ure, they would always keep the mind in &s;ubjection. Rea&s;on has no authority over us, but by its power to warn us again&s;t evil.</Q>
<P>IGNORANCE is even proverbially &s;tiled the mother of devotion, and when joined to weakne&s;s, fear and melancholy has been called the parent of <HI>&s;uper&s;tition.</HI> But never hath <HI>godline&s;s</HI> or piety been

<P>You will not forget that in the paper under con|&s;ideration, the IDLER &s;ets out with de&s;cribing us as <HI>thinking beings.</HI> Even in the pa&s;&s;age immediate|ly before us, he &s;peaks of man as a being compo&s;|ed of corporeal &s;en&s;es and of mind; viz. of &s;en&s;ual and intellectual appetites.

<P>As the IDLER, in the preceding pa&s;&s;age, gave the name of godline&s;s, and piety, to confe&s;&s;ed &s;u|per&s;tition, &s;o here he has given the name of piety and religion to the ritual formalities of devotion, and the futile farce of hypocri&s;y.

<P><Q> No education, &s;ays he, however truly chri&s;|tian, can confer on a child a degree of under|&s;tanding above his years, or detach his ideas from material objects, from which even grown per&s;ons cannot detach theirs.&mdash;You may, indeed, make him repeat after you the words you dictate to him; you may al&s;o, if it be required, make him &s;ay he under&s;tands them: for that conce&s;|&s;ion co&s;ts him little, and he had much rather &s;ay, he comprehends you, than be chid or beaten for want of apprehen&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter to the archbi&s;hop of Paris.</NOTE>.</Q> Thus children, as I

ob&s;erved, may be made hypocrites; but genuine piety can be practi&s;ed only by per&s;ons of riper un|der&s;tandings. That this is mo&s;t probably the ca&s;e, appears al&s;o, from the IDLER's &s;ub&s;equent &s;ugge&s;|tion, that in youth and manhood nobody has any piety at all; which could hardly be the ca&s;e, if true religion were really impre&s;&s;ed on childhood.</P>
<Q> But as we advance forward into the crouds of life, innumerable delights &s;ollicit our inclinations, and innumerable cares di&s;tract our attention; the time of youth is Pa&s;&s;ed in noi&s;y &s;rolicks; manhood is led on from hope, to hope, from project to project; the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of plea&s;ure, the incbriation of &s;uc|ce&s;s, the ardour of expectation, and the vehemence of competition, chain down the mind alike to the pre&s;ent &s;cene, nor is it remembered how &s;oon this mi&s;t of trifles mu&s;t be &s;cattered, and the bubbles that float upon the river of life, be lo&s;t for ever in the gulph of eternity.</Q>
<P>What an appearance of preci&s;ion amid&s;t this pretty farrago of metaphors!

is the effect of phy&s;ical evil.

<P>We come now to the inference, drawn from the above curious chain of philo&s;ophical rea&s;oning.</P>

<P>What an incentive this to the virtue of patience! If phy&s;ical evil be the cau&s;e of moral good, the effect cannot be greater than the cau&s;e. Add to this, that in a world &s;o wicked as the IDLER de|&s;cribes it, moral good is de&s;irable only on account of the phy&s;ical good attending it. What motive then hath any individual to adopt the virtue of pa|tience, unle&s;s rea&s;on be given him to think the phy&s;ical good re&s;ulting to him from the virtue of his fellow creatures, will indemnify him for the phy &s;ical evil he mu&s;t &s;uffer from their vices, and in the ordinary cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>Oh! but the IDLER &s;ays, <Q>patience is a virtue by which we are prepared for that &s;tate in which evil &s;hall be no more.</Q></P>
<P>What an idea mu&s;t a writer entertain of a future &s;tate of happine&s;s, who &s;uppo&s;es the virtue of pa|tience requi&s;ite to render us capable of enduring it! It had certainly been more philo&s;ophical to

<P>The only circum&s;tance which you repre&s;ent as di&s;agreeable in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the Cor&s;i|cans, is their living in a perpetual &s;tate of publick warfare with the Genoe&s;e.

<P>But let us attend to what is advanced on this &s;ub|ject, by a philo&s;opher of whom, you tell us, Paoli expre&s;&s;ed an high admiration; I mean your friend Rou&s;&s;eau, already quoted, whom the Cor&s;ican ge|neral invited over, as another Solon, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in drawing up a code of laws, for the u&s;e of his nation. And here let me congratulate the&s;e brave i&s;landers, on ob&s;erving, in your own account of them, that criterion of national pro&s;perity, which the author of the &s;ocial compact, affirms to be in|di&s;putable.</P>
<Q>What, &s;ays he, is the end of political &s;ociety? Doubtie&s;s the pre&s;ervation and pro&s;perity of its members. And what is the mo&s;t certain &s;ign or proof of the&s;e? Certainly it is their number and population. Let us not look el&s;ewhere for this di&s;|puted proof; &s;ince it is plain that government mu&s;t be the be&s;t, under which the citizens increa&s;c and

<P>Now, Sir, you tells us that the Cor&s;icans, not|with&s;tanding their frequent lo&s;&s;es in action, have in a few years increa&s;ed &s;ixteen thou&s;and <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Account of Cor&s;ica, P. 135,</NOTE>.

<Q><P> It is on this principle of population, conti|nues Rou&s;&s;eau, that we ought to judge of the &s;everal periods of time that merit the preference, in being di&s;tingui&s;hed for the pro&s;perity of man|kind. We have in general, too much admired tho&s;e, in which literature, and the fine arts have flouri&s;hed, without inve&s;tigating the &s;ecret cau&s;es of their cultivation, or duly con&s;idering their fa|tal effects, <HI>id queapud imperito humanitas voca|batur, cum pars &s;ervitutis e&s;&s;et.</HI> No, let intere&s;t|ed writers &s;ay what they will, whenever the in|habitants of a country decrea&s;e, it is not true that all things go well, whatever be its exter|nal pro&s;perity and &s;plendour.&mdash;We &s;hould not &s;o much regard the apparent repo&s;e of the world, and the tranquility of its governors, as the well being of whole nations, and particularly of the mo&s;t populous &s;tates.

<P>It is from the permanent &s;ituation of a peo|ple, that their real pro&s;perity or calamity mu&s;t ari&s;e. When they all tamely &s;ubmit to the yoke; then it is that all are peri&s;hing.

<P>It is otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to your mi&s;taken no|tions of LIBERTY; for which you pro&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t laudable zeal. <Q><HI>Liberty,</HI> &s;ay you, is &s;o na|tural and &s;o dear to mankind, whether as indi|viduals, or as members of &s;ociety, that it is indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s.

<P>I am afraid, Sir, we go a little too far here. The arts and &s;ciences have flouri&s;hed in countries, to which liberty was at the &s;ame time a &s;tranger. At lea&s;t, if the arts and &s;ciences be the natural offspring of liberty, they have generally proved very unnatural children of a mo&s;t indulgent parent: for there are &s;ew countries in which they have flouri&s;hed to any remarkable degree, which they have not in time, by their fomentation of vice and luxury, and the occa&s;ion they have given to the multiplicity, and uncertainty of the laws, betrayed into the mo&s;t ab|ject &s;lavery <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For it is to be ob&s;erved, that if the improvement of a people in the arts of government, viz. in making and enforcing laws, keep not pace with their advances in the arts of luxury, and their temptations to the breach of tho&s;e laws, their mini&s;ters, being at a lo&s;s for con&s;titutional expedients, will be apt to adopt the fir&s;t that come to hand. There is, however, &s;ome little difference between <HI>governing</HI> a people and <HI>dragooning</HI> them. Not but that <HI>military execution</HI> is ju&s;t &s;uch another rough po|litical guardian of public liberty, as <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination</HI> is of private virtue. And if the one be wi&s;e and noble, as Mr. Bo&s;well ad|mits, with regard to individuals, the other may be &s;o in re&s;pect to the public. If occa&s;ional murders are better than frequent adulteries, occa&s;ional ma&s;&s;acres may be better than frequent tumults. <Q>Politicians, indeed, remark that no oppre&s;&s;ion is &s;o heavy and la&s;ting, as that which is inflicted by the perver&s;ion and exorbitance of legal authority. The robber may be &s;eized, and the invader repelled whenever they are found; they who pretend no right but that of force, may by force be puni&s;hed or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. But when plunder bears the name of impo&s;t, and murder is perpetrated by a judicial &s;entence, fortune is intimidated, and wi&s;dom confounded; re&s;i&s;tance &s;hrinks from an alliance with rebellion, and the vil|lain remains &s;ecure in the robes of the magi&s;trate.</Q> Rambler, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. 148.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47">Will you object, that there is a difference be|tween a parent and a nur&s;e; that an art may be improved and &s;flouri&s;h where it was not invented. I grant it. Nece&s;&s;ity is notoriou&s;ly the mother of invention: but between liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, I hope I need not remark the difference.&mdash;Will you &s;ay, that a &s;tate of natural nece&s;&s;ity, may be a &s;tate of political liberty?

<Q>There is no doubt, you &s;ay, but by entering into &s;ociety, mankind voluntarily give up a part of their natural rights, and bind them&s;elves to the obedience of laws, calculated for the general good.

<P>So far all is well: and to this you might have added, that <Q>when the &s;ocial compact is vio|lated, individuals recover their natural liberty and are re-inve&s;ted with their original rights, by lo&s;ing that conventional liberty, for the &s;ake of which they had renounced them <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Social Compact, book I. chap. 6.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But you proceed; <Q>perhaps the limits between the power of government, and the liberty of the people, &s;hould not be too &s;trictly marked out. Men of ta&s;te reckon that picture hard, where the out-lines are &s;o &s;trong as to be clearly &s;een. They admire a piece of painting, where the co|lours are delicately blended, and the tints, which point out every particular object, are &s;oftened into each other, by an in&s;en&s;ible gradation. So in a virtuous &s;tate, there &s;hould be &s;uch a mu|tual confidence between the government and the people, that the rights of each &s;hould not be expre&s;sly defined. But flagrant inju&s;tice, on one &s;ide or other, is not to be concealed; and, with|out que&s;tion it is the privilege of the &s;ide that is injured, to vindicate it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>As you have been in Italy, Sir, I &s;hall not di&s;|pute your ta&s;te for painting; there is beauty in the allu&s;ion. The fault is, it wants propriety.
<PB N="45" REF="49">
If in&s;tances of flagrant inju&s;tice, either in the ad|mini&s;tration of government or in the people, are to be re&s;ented by the party injured, I &s;hould think it would be better for both parties, that the limits of power in the one, and of liberty in the other, &s;hould be &s;trictly marked out; by which means &s;uch flagrant in&s;tances might be prevented. It is much ea&s;ier to prevent than amend; and perhaps there is no greater natural tendency or moral temp|tation to our tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the rights of others, than their being left vague and indeterminate. We are &s;educed to take one &s;tep, becau&s;e it is almo&s;t imperceptible to our&s;elves, and the next, becau&s;e it may not be perceived by others, a third, becau&s;e the two former were overlooked; and then we have proceeded far enough to think we have a right to maintain our ground. The recipro|cal encroachments which are thus daily making by the government and the people, require a fixed and, if po&s;&s;ible, invariable line to be drawn between them. <Q>Thus far &s;halt thou go, and no farther,</Q> ought to be the language of the laws. For, as a very &s;en&s;ible Italian author ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, there is no exception to this general maxim, <Q>every mem|ber of &s;ociety &s;hould know when he is criminal, and when he is innocent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Marquis Beccaria, author of a late E&s;&s;ay on Crimes and Puni&s;hments; who adds, that if arbitrary magi&s;trates be nece&s;|&s;ary in any government, it proceeds from &s;ome fault in the con&s;titutibn.

In like man|ner, if the publi&s;hing a libel, or a &s;uppo&s;ed outlaw's &s;urrendering him&s;elf to ju&s;tice for having done &s;o, be wor&s;e than capital crimes, they &s;hould be declared &s;uch by law; that the offender may know he is le&s;s intitled to lenity, than tho&s;e who are charged with the perpetration of rapes and murders.</P><P>If the folly of printing and &s;ecreting an ob&s;cene poem, be wor&s;e than felony or trea&s;on, let it be declared &s;o by law, and let the printer be hang'd, drawn and quartered.

In every land of liberty, there &s;hould be promulgated a proportional puni&s;h|ment for every known crime. At the &s;ame time the power of every part of the legiflature and admini&s;tration &s;hould be deter|mined and made known, that the people might neither plead ignorance, nor be en&s;nared into guilt. In countries where it is not &s;o, but where crimes that are daily committed, are puni&s;h|able at the di&s;cretion of &s;tipendiary judges; where there are men, or bodies of men, either in a legiflative or judicial capa|city, who keep &s;ecret, or take upon them to determine at plea|&s;ure, their own privileges and prerogatives; in &s;uch countries, I &s;ay, the people, tho' free and licentious enough to be in&s;o|lent to their prince. are en&s;laved by the tyranny of his and their own &s;ervants.

When a people indeed are projecting, to throw off a foreign yoke, as in the ca&s;es you mention of the Cor&s;icans and the Hollanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&dagger;Mr. Bo&s;well mi&s;takes however in the application of the motto <HI>Frangimus &s;i colliaimur.</HI> It did not regard the different orders of men, in any of the united provinces, but the gene|ral union of tho&s;e provinces, as equals and equally concerned in repelling their cruel ma&s;ters the Spaniards.</NOTE>, it is undoubtedly nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould not be at variance among each other. But you mu&s;t not thence infer, be|cau&s;e the Cor&s;ican &s;ignors and pea&s;ants, ought for the pre&s;ervation of their liberty, to concur in a mode of government, to exclude the tyranny of
<PB N="48" REF="52">
the Genoe&s;e, that therefore the pre&s;ervation of na|tional liberty, depends on a perfect coalition be|tween the lords and commons of every other coun|try. There are countries, in which the reciprocal jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the &s;everal con&s;tituent parts of government, and their caution again&s;t the the encroachments of each other, form the bul|wark of the con&s;titution. Their mutual jealou&s;y, is their mutual &s;ecurity, and their occa&s;ional di&s;|cord the con&s;tant guardian of public freedom.</P>
<P>HAVING thus, &s;ir, very &s;eriou&s;ly taken you to ta&s;k with regard to your mi&s;taken notions in poli|ticks and morals, I mu&s;t beg leave to have a word or two more with you, re&s;pecting your very &s;in|gular penetration as to per&s;onal characters and the knowlege of mankind. But in this we will be le&s;s &s;erious.</P>
<P>What, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, could in|duce you to hint at a parallel between two &s;uch he|terogeneous beings as Pa&s;quali Paoli and Samuel John&s;on? How much more &s;ucce&s;sfully might you have employed a talent for parallelizing, by mak|ing choice of a per&s;on equally popular, patriotic and enterprizing. You can be at no lo&s;s to gue&s;e whom I mean. Indeed the &s;imilitude between Mr. Wilkes and General Paoli, is &s;o very &s;triking, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t the inclination I feel to draw their compari&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>A PARALLEL BETWEEN PASCAL PAOLI, GE|NERAL OF THE CORSICANS, AND JOHN WILKES ESQ; MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MIDDLESEX <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to tho&s;e learned per&s;ons, who may expect, from what is promi&s;ed in the title page, to find this compari&s;on written &s;trictly in the manner of Plutarch; I &s;hall only beg leave to re|mind them of the old adage <HI>fronti nulla &s;ides;</HI> and, if that be not &s;atisfactory, to ob&s;erve that it is &s;aid to be written <HI>after,</HI> not <HI>in</HI> the manner. To be caught <HI>in the manner</HI> is an ab&s;olute phra&s;e, and I would rather the reader &s;hould take <HI>after</HI> to be an adverb of time or place than be guilty of it. In &s;hort, it was written, in both &s;en&s;es of the word, <HI>after</HI> the compo&s;ition of Plutarch's la&s;t imitator, the Reverend Mr. Spence, who treading &s;o prox|imately on the heels of his great ma&s;ter, <HI>proxime, &s;ed longo inter|vallo,</HI> I pre&s;ume I may without offen&s;e, and that without being a very happy imitator, be at lea&s;t <HI>proximus a pro&s;tremo.</HI></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>As to the two per&s;ons whom I have cho&s;en to compare together, it may be ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t place, that they yield in patrioti&s;m and popularity, to few or none of tho&s;e lawgivers, generals and he|roes, which are u&s;ually the &s;ubject of Plutarch's enquiries.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their education, that of both has been liberal.</P>
<P>Mr. Bo&s;well &s;ays of the general, <Q>that he talked a great deal on hi&s;tory and on literature. I &s;oon perceived that he was a fine cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, that his mind was enriched with a variety of know|ledge, and that his conver&s;ation at meals was in|&s;tructive and entertaining. Before dinner he had &s;poken French <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tour to Cor&s;ica, page 293.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54">All this may be &s;aid with the greate&s;t truth of Mr. Wilkes; and I remember particularly that when I had one day the plea&s;ure of dining with him, <HI>before dinner he had &s;poken French</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I might mention another in&s;tance of &s;imilarity, were it not too trivial. But as Mr. Bo&s;well thinks it of importance enough to ob&s;erve that Paoli was dre&s;&s;ed in green and gold, when he appeared &s;o great at Sollacaro; I cannot forbear remarking that Mr. Wilkes, was al&s;o dre&s;&s;ed in green and gold, when he was elected Member of Parliament for Middle&s;ex, and made &s;o popu|lar an appearance at Brentford Butts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Then again there is &s;omething extremely odd in each of them, in the beginning of their formation of an acquaintance. <Q>In con&s;equence of their be|ing in continual danger from treachery and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, they have formed a habit of &s;tudi|ou&s;ly ob&s;erving every new face.</Q> Mr. Bo&s;well a&s;&s;ures us, that this is the ca&s;e with Paoli; and I have ob&s;erved it to be &s;o true with regard to to Mr. Wilkes, that when it has appeared there could be no danger from the parties, even when the ladies have vi&s;ited him, he has been to a remar|kable degree, though a bold man, &s;tudiou&s;ly ob|&s;ervant of every new face.</P>
<P>They are alike too in their conde&s;cen&s;ion, their politene&s;s, and the very gracious manner in which they receive compliments. I take Mr. Bo&s;well's word for Paoli, and I appeal to the numerous a&s;|&s;embly that were in Guildhall, during the late poll for city members, in regard to the &s;ingular polite|ne&s;s of Mr. Wilkes.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of Paoli, in acquiring &s;uch a power over the Cor&s;icans, in the manner he has done, is very extraordinary; but the va&s;t extent of Mr.
<PB N="51" REF="55">
Wilkes's power and popularity is ab&s;olutely amaz|ing! Mr. Bo&s;well ob&s;erves, in the words of Thua|nus, <HI>&s;unt mobilia Cor&s;orum ingenia;</HI> the di&s;po&s;ition of the Cor&s;icans are changeable. And yet, &s;ays he, after ten years, their attachment to Paoli, is as &s;trong as at the fir&s;t. Nay they have an enthu&s;i|a&s;tic admiration of him. <HI>Que&s;to grand' uomo man|dalo per dio a liberare la patria.</HI> This great man whom God has &s;ent to free our country! was the manner in which they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to me concerning him.</P>
<P>Now no one can doubt that the di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h is as changeable as the Cor&s;icans; and yet after many years, their attachment to Mr. Wilkes, is as &s;trong, or &s;tronger than at fir&s;t. And as to what his enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers &s;ay of him, I think it hardly decent or &s;afe to repeat it. Mr. Bo&s;well mentions it as a great thing that Paoli, &s;urrounded by his guards, could re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of the populace crouding to an audience. But what is this to Mr. Wilkes's in&s;luence over the populace; who when he was committed to pri&s;on by a court of law, Was re&s;cued by the people, and had authority enough over a multitudinous mob, to put in exe|cution the otherwi&s;e ineffectual order of his judges, and to protect their officers from in&s;ult?</P>
<P>As it is natural for the enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers of any man to fall into ab&s;urd notions of his motives of action, &s;o it is natural for the admirers of one man to fall into the &s;ame ab&s;urdities of another.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ome of Mr. Wilkes's friends have &s;up|po&s;ed, as Mr. Bo&s;well did of Paoli, that he had a &s;oul &s;uperior to intere&s;t. But what was Paoli's
<PB N="52" REF="56">
an&s;wer? Even this.&mdash; <Q>It is not &s;uperior, &s;aid he, my intere&s;t is to gain a name. I know well that he who does good to his country will gain that: and I expect it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour to Cor&s;ica, p. 296.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wilkes's heart grows big, like that of Paoli, when he talks of his countrymen. He &s;eems de&s;irous like him to &s;ettle the con&s;titution of his country, and to wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much, as to to have an opportunity of convincing his fellow &s;ub|jects, <Q>that the magi&s;trates act with abilities and uprightne&s;s; &s;o that we may place that &s;alutary confidence in our rulers, which is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring re&s;pect and &s;tability to government <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 312.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In conver&s;ing on the&s;e &s;ubjects and particularly on the affairs of general warrants, he falls like Paoli, into frequent reveries, and breaks into &s;allies of the grande&s;ts and noble&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m. I recollect two in&s;tances of this, &s;ays Mr. Bo&s;well, &s;peaking of Paoli. <Q>What a thought! that thou&s;ands owe their happiness to you!</Q> then throwing him&s;elf into an attitude, as if he &s;aw the lofty mountain of fame before him. <Q>There is my object (point|ing to the &s;ummit) if I fall, I fall at lea&s;t there (pointing a good way up) <HI>magnis tamen excidit au &s;is</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 313.</NOTE>.</Q> I remember to have ob&s;erved &s;ome|thing or the &s;ame kind once in Mr. Wilkes. "What a deci&s;ion!" &s;ays he (meaning that again&s;t General Warrants) <Q>thou&s;ands will owe their &s;ecurity to me!</Q> then throwing him&s;elf back in his chair, as if he &s;aw the po&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="57">
on the pinnacle of fame vacant. <Q><HI>There,</HI> is my object,</Q> pointing as high as he could. <Q>if I fail I fail at lead <HI>there:</HI></Q> pointing a good way lower down, to a po&s;t of honour too, tho' not a <HI>private &s;tation!</HI></P>
<P>It would be almo&s;t endle&s;s to particularize every in&s;tance of &s;imilarity in the&s;e two illu&s;trious cha|racters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus, though calm and fully ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, Paoli is animated with an extraordinary degree of vivacity.&mdash;He never feels a moment of de&s;pondency; the vivacity and ver&s;atility of his mind being amazing.&mdash;He is acquainted with the hi&s;tory of England and has even &s;een a North Briton.&mdash;He has not the conjugal virtues, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which mutatis mutandis will &s;uit ths Engli&s;h patriot as well as the Cor&s;ican. It is true that Paoli has never yet been in the King's-bench pri&s;on. But his predece&s;&s;or King Theodore was, and that le&s;s honourably attended. Mr. Wilkes even in pri&s;on being attended in the &s;ame manner as Paoli in all his glory: viz. by a certain number of &s;oldiers &s;et continually guard on him. and his &s;till clo&s;er guards of the Cerberian &s;pecies that watch his chamber door. Tour, &amp;c. p. 344.</NOTE>. I &s;hall proceed therefore to mention a circum&s;tance in which they are not &s;imilar; which is Plutarch's u&s;ual way too, as well as that of his imitators. The faculties of Mr. Wilkes's mind are not &s;o much concentrated in that &s;ingle one of fore&s;ight, as Paoli's are repre&s;ented to be. Paoli is, according to Mr. Bo&s;well, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the gift, talent, or whatever you plen&s;e to call it, of &s;econd &s;ight. Whether he be the &s;on of a &s;eventh &s;on, we are not informed, but the in&s;tances of his fore&s;eeing future events, it is hinted are as numerous as the hairs on your head. On this &s;ubject I cannot help repeating the ob&s;ervation of that learned imitator of Plutarch whom I endeavour to imitate, <HI>haud pa&s;&s;i|bus equis!</HI> <Q>I doubt not, but that it is the &s;ame with the faculties of the mind, as it is with
<PB N="54" REF="58">
the limbs of the body, which ever is exerci&s;ed much more than the re&s;t. It is a common ob|&s;ervation, and generally holds through the whole &s;et, that a chairman's legs will be more mu&s;cular in proportion than his arms; and a rower's arms more mu&s;cular than his legs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Spence's parallel between Hill and Magliabechi.</NOTE>.</Q> Ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner if one man was to exerci&s;e his mental opticks, only in looking &s;traight forward, as appears to be the ca&s;e of Paoli <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For, knowing &s;o much as he does, his knowledge mu&s;t be either intuitive or acquired by immediate apprehen&s;ion; &s;ince it does not appear that he is capable of &s;tudy. <HI>La te&s;ta mi rompa,</HI> &s;ays he, if I &s;tudy ten minutes. And this clears up a difficulty; for otherwi&s;e how could he have a mind fitted for philo&s;ophical &s;peculations, as Mr. Bo&s;well a&s;&s;ures us he has?&mdash;Common men mu&s;t &s;tudy philo&s;ophy, but conjurors are philo|&s;ophers of cour&s;e.</NOTE>, while another con&s;tantly exer|ci&s;es his natural opticks in looking tran&s;ver&s;ely, as in the ca&s;e of Mr. Wilkes, it is no wonder that the one &s;hould acquire a fore&s;ight to an infinite degree be|yond the other. Hence it is that while Paoli reads the events of futurity, it is not in the power of poor Mr. Wilkes to look right forward an inch beyond his no&s;e.</P>
<P>Paoli progno&s;ticates liberty and pro&s;perity to his brave Cor&s;icans after his decea&s;e; Wilkes predicts nothing, but is in doubt what will become of the rights and privileges of Engli&s;hmen even while he is alive.</P>
<P>Paoli is a prophet as well as a patriot: Wilkes may be a patriot, but in that he is certainly no con|jurer.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="59">On the whole, it is difficult to &s;ay which hath the greater merit. If the Cor&s;icans have reaped advan|tages from the patriotic &s;pirit and great talents of Paoli, &s;o have the Engli&s;h from tho&s;e of Mr. Wilkes; each appearing to have exerted &s;uch &s;pirits and talents in a very extraordinary manner. But of the two, Mr. Wilkes is certainly the mo&s;t enter|prizing patriot in England, and Paoli by much the one more fortunate in Cor&s;ica.</P>
