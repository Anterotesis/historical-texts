<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>HARRY, can you blow off all the&s;e dandelion feathers at a bla&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>See&mdash;you have left almo&s;t half of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you do better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;look here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are &s;till &s;everal left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tutor.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty child's play you have got there. Bring me one of the dan|delion heads, and let us &s;ee if we can make no other u&s;e of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is a very full one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know what the&s;e fea|thers, as you call them, are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe they belong to the &s;eeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do, and they are worth ex|amining. Look at this &s;ingle one through my magnifying gla&s;s: you ob&s;erve the &s;eed at the bottom, like the point of a dart. From it &s;prings a &s;lender hairy &s;haft, crowned by a mo&s;t elegant &s;preading plume. You &s;ee, it is a complete arrow of nature's manufacture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>How exact!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a beautiful thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ure you &s;ee the u&s;e of it at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is to &s;et the &s;eeds a flying with the wind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I &s;uppo&s;e they &s;ow them|&s;elves where they light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do. This is one of na|ture's contrivances for <HI>di&s;&s;emination,</HI> or
<PB N="3" REF="6">
that &s;cattering of the &s;eeds of plants which makes them reach all the places proper for their growth. I dare &s;ay you have ob&s;erved other plants fur|ni&s;hed with the &s;ame winged or fea|thered &s;eeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes&mdash;there is ground&s;el, and ragwort, and thi&s;tles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a windy day I have &s;een the air all full of thi&s;tle down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely; and for that rea&s;on you never &s;aw a new made bank of earth, or a heap of dung in the fields, but it was pre&s;ently covered with thi&s;|tles. The&s;e, and the other plants that have been named, belong to a very exten&s;ive cla&s;s, which it is worth while being acquainted with. They are call|ed the <HI>compound flowered plants.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you be &s;o good as to give us a lecture about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. Get me a dandelion in flower, and a thi&s;tle head, and a dai&s;y&mdash;if you cannot find a com|mon
<PB N="4" REF="7">
dai&s;y, one of the great ox-eye dai&s;ies in the corn will do as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. and H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. All the&s;e are <HI>com|pound flowers;</HI> for if you will examine them narrowly, you will perceive that they con&s;i&s;t of a number of little flow|ers, or <HI>florets,</HI> enclo&s;ed in a common cup, which cup is made of a number of &s;cales lying upon each other like the tiles of a hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The florets are not all alike in &s;hape. In the dandelion you will ob|&s;erve that they con&s;i&s;t of a tube, from which, at its upper end, proceeds a &s;ort of &s;trap-&s;haped tongue or fillet: in the thi&s;tle they are tubular or funnel-&s;haped throughout: in the dai&s;y, the center ones which form the <HI>di&s;k,</HI> as it is called, are tubular, while tho&s;e in the circumference have a broad &s;trap on one fide, which altogether compo&s;e the <HI>rays</HI> of the flowers; whence this
<PB N="5" REF="8">
&s;ort are called <HI>radiated.</HI> Now take the gla&s;s and examine the florets &s;ingly. Can you di&s;cern their chives and pointals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may remark that there are five chives to each, the tips of which unite into a tube, through which the pointal pa&s;&s;es, having its &s;ummit dou|ble and curled back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can ju&s;t make it out with the gla&s;s, but hardly with the naked eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is from this circum&s;tance of the tips of the chives growing together that Linnaeus has taken his di&s;tinction of the whole cla&s;s; and he has named it <HI>Syngene&s;ia,</HI> from two Greek words hav|ing that &s;ignification. You will fur|ther ob&s;erve that all the&s;e florets &s;tand upon a &s;tool or receptacle at the bot|tom of the flower, which is the cu&s;hion left on the dandelion &s;talk after the &s;eeds are blown away. Into this the &s;eeds are flightly &s;tuck, which are one
<PB N="6" REF="9">
a-piece to every perfect or fertile &s;lo|ret. This is the general &s;tructure of the compound flowers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are all their &s;eeds feathered?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not all. The&s;e of the dai&s;y are not. But in a great many &s;pecies they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould have thought the&s;e were a very u&s;eful cla&s;s of plants, by the pains nature has taken to &s;pread them, if you had not told me that thi&s;tles and ragwort, and ground&s;el, were &s;ome of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if you do not confine your idea of u&s;efulne&s;s to what is &s;erviceable to man, but extend it to the whole creation, you may &s;afely conclude from their abundance that they mu&s;t be highly u&s;eful in the general econo|my of nature. In fact, no plants feed a greater number of in&s;ects, and none are more important to the &s;mall birds, to whom they furni&s;h food by their &s;eeds, and a fine warm down for lining
<PB N="7" REF="10">
their ne&s;ts. On the approach of win|ter you may &s;ee whole &s;locks of linnets and gold-finches pecking among the thi&s;tles; and you know that ground&s;el is a favourite treat to birds in a cage. To man, however, they are for the mo&s;t part trouble&s;ome and un&s;ightly weeds. Burdock, thi&s;tles, and yar|row, overrun his hedge banks; dande|lion, and hawkweeds, which much re&s;emble them, fill his meadows; the tall and branching ragwort, and blue &s;uccory, cumber his pa&s;tures; and wild camomile, ox eye, and corn mary-gold, choak up his corn fields. The&s;e plants in general have a bitter nau&s;eous ta&s;te, &s;o that no cattle will touch them. Dai&s;ies, I believe, are the chief excep|tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;ome of them, I &s;uppo&s;e, are u&s;eful to man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;everal, and in various ways. Some that have milky bitter juices are employed in medicine for purifying
<PB N="8" REF="11">
the blood and removing ob&s;tructions. Of the&s;e are dandelion, &s;uccory, and &s;owthi&s;tle. Many others are bitter and &s;trongly aromatic; as camomile, wormwood, &s;outhernwood, feverfew, and tan&s;y: the&s;e are good for &s;trength|ening the &s;tomach, and expelling worms. That capital ingredient in &s;allad, lettuce, is of this cla&s;s, and &s;o is endive. Artichoke forms a very &s;ingular article of diet, for the part chiefly eaten, called the bottom, is the receptacle of the flower, upon which the choke, or &s;eeds with their feathers, is placed. It is &s;aid that &s;ome of the larger &s;pecies of thi&s;tles may be dre&s;t and eaten the &s;ame way. Then there is Jeru&s;alem artichoke, which is the root of a &s;pecies of &s;un-flower, and when boiled much re&s;embles in ta&s;te an artichoke bottom. On the whole, however, a very &s;mall proportion of this cla&s;s of plants is u&s;ed in food.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there no garden flowers be|longing to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Several; e&s;pecially of the au|tumnal ones. There are &s;un-flowers of various kinds, which are the large&s;t flowers the garden produces, though not the mo&s;t &s;ightly; marygolds, both the common, and the French and African, a&s;ters, china-a&s;ters, golden|rod, and chry&s;anthemums. Very few flowers of this cla&s;s have an agreeable &s;cent, and their &s;hape is not the mo&s;t plea&s;ing; but they have often gay co|lours, and make a figure in the garden when other things are over. Well&mdash;this is mo&s;t that I recollect worth no|ticing of the compound-flowered plants. They are a difficult cla&s;s to make out botanically, though pretty ea&s;ily known from each other by &s;ight! I will take care to point out to you the principal of them that we meet with in our walks, and you mu&s;t get acquainted with them.</P>

<HEAD>GREAT MEN.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL &s;how you a <HI>great man,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Mr. C.</HI> one day to his &s;on, at the time the duke of Bridgewater's canal was making. He accordingly took him to a place where a number of workmen were employed in rai&s;ing a prodigious mound, on the top of which the canal was to be carried acro&s;s a deep valley. In the mid&s;t of them was a very plain dre&s;&s;ed man, awkward in his ge&s;tures, uncouth in his appearance, and rather heavy in his countenance&mdash;in &s;hort, a mere countryman like the re&s;t. He had a plan in his hand, and was giv|ing directions to the people round him, and &s;urveying the whole labour with profound attention. This, <HI>Arthur,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Mr. C.</HI> is the <HI>great Mr. Brindley.</HI></P>
<P>What, cried <HI>Arthur</HI> in &s;urpri&s;e, is that a <HI>great man?</HI></P>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a very great man. Why are you &s;urpri&s;ed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, but I &s;hould have expected a great man to have looked very differently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It matters little how a man looks, if he can perform great things. That per&s;on, without any advantages of education, has become, by the force of his own genius, the fir&s;t en|gineer of the age. He is doing things that were never done or even thought of in this country before. He pierces hills, bridges over vallies, makes aque|ducts acro&s;s navigable rivers, and in &s;hort, is likely to change the whole face of the country, and to introduce im|provements the value of which cannot be calculated. When at a lo&s;s how to bring about any of his de&s;igns, he does not go to other people for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but he con&s;ults the wonderful facul|ties of his own mind, and finds a way to overcome his difficulties. He looks
<PB N="12" REF="15">
like a ru&s;tic, it is true, but he has a &s;oul of the fir&s;t order, &s;uch as is not granted to one out of millions of the human race.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are all men of extraordinary abilities, properly <HI>great men?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The word has been variou&s;ly u&s;ed; but I would call every one a great man, <HI>who does great things by means of his own powers.</HI> Great abilities are often employed about trifles, or indo|lently wa&s;ted without any con&s;idera|ble exertion at all. To make a great man, the object pur&s;ued &s;hould be large and important, and vigour and per&s;everance &s;hould be employed in the pur&s;uit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the great men I remember to have read about, were kings, or ge|nerals, or prime-mini&s;ters, or in &s;ome high &s;tation or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is natural they &s;hould &s;tand foremo&s;t in the li&s;t of great men, becau&s;e the &s;phere in which they act
<PB N="13" REF="16">
is an exten&s;ive one, and what they do has a powerful influence over num|bers of mankind. Yet tho&s;e that in|vent u&s;eful arts, or di&s;cover important truths which may promote the comfort and happine&s;s of unborn generations in the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the world, act a &s;till more important part; and their claim to merit is generally more undoubted than that of the former, becau&s;e what they do is more certainly their own.</P>
<P>In order to e&s;timate the real &s;hare a man in a high &s;tation has had in the great events which have been attribut|ed to him, &s;trip him in your imagina|tion of all the external advantages of rank and power, and &s;ee what a figure he would have made without them&mdash;or fancy a common man put in his place, and judge whether affairs would have gone on in the &s;ame track. Au|gu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, and Louis the XIVth of France, have both been called great
<PB N="14" REF="17">
princes; but deprive them of their crown, and they will both dwindle into ob&s;cure and trivial characters. But no change of circum&s;tances could reduce Alfred the Great to the level of a common man. The two former could &s;ink into their graves, and yield their power to a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and &s;carcely be mi&s;&s;ed; but Alfred's death changed the fate of his kingdom. Thus with Epaminondas fell all the glory and greatne&s;s of the Theban &s;tate. He fir&s;t rai&s;ed it to con&s;equence, and it could not &s;urvive him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was not Czar Peter a great man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not &s;ure that he de|&s;erves that title. Being a de&s;potic prince, at the head of a va&s;t empire, he could put in execution whatever plans he was led to adopt, and the&s;e plans in general were grand and bene|ficial to his country. But the means he u&s;ed were &s;uch as the ma&s;ter of the
<PB N="15" REF="18">
lives and fortunes of millions could ea&s;ily employ, and there was more of brutal force than of &s;kill and judgment in the manner in which he pur&s;ued his de&s;igns. Still, he was an <HI>extraordinary</HI> man; and the re&s;olution of leaving his throne, in order to acquire in fo|reign countries the knowledge nece&s;|&s;ary to re&s;cue his own from barba|ri&s;m, was a feature of greatne&s;s. A truly great prince, however, would have employed him&s;elf better than in learning to build &s;hips at Sardam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was Alexander the Great?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great conqueror, but not a great man. It was ea&s;y for him, with the well-di&s;ciplined army of Greeks which he received from his father Philip, to over-run the unwarlike kingdoms of A&s;ia, and defeat the Great King, as the king of Per&s;ia was called; but though he &s;howed &s;ome marks of an elevated mind, he &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed few qualities which
<PB N="16" REF="19">
could have rai&s;ed him to di&s;tinction had he been born in an humble &s;ta|tion. Compare his fugitive grandeur, &s;upported by able mini&s;ters and gene|rals, to the power which his tutor, the great Ari&s;totle, merely through the force of his own genius, exerci&s;ed over men's minds throughout the mo&s;t civil|ized part of the world for two thou|&s;and years after his death. Compare al&s;o the part which has been acted in the world by the Spani&s;h monarchs, the ma&s;ters of immen&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Eu|rope and America, to that by Chri&s;to|pher Columbus, the Genoe&s;e naviga|tor, who could have it in&s;cribed on his tomb-&s;tone, that he <HI>gave</HI> a new world to the kingdoms of Ca&s;tille and Arragon. The&s;e compari&s;ons will teach you to di&s;tingui&s;h between great|ne&s;s of character and greatne&s;s of &s;ta|tion, which are too often confounded. He who governs a great country may in one &s;en&s;e be called a great king;
<PB N="17" REF="20">
but this is no more than an appellation belonging to rank, like that of the Great Mogul or the Grand Seignior, and infers no more per&s;onal grandeur than the title of Mr. Such an one, the Great Grocer or Brewer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mu&s;t not great men be good men, too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that man is great who does great things, it will not follow that goodne&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be one of his qualities, &s;ince that chiefly refers to the end and intention of actions. Julius Cae&s;ar, and Cromwell, for ex|ample, were men capable of the greate&s;t exploits; but directing them not to the public good, but to the purpo&s;es of their own ambition, in pur|&s;uit of which they violated all the du|ties of morality, they have obtained the title of <HI>great bad men.</HI> A per&s;on, however, cannot be great at all with|out po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing many virtues. He mu&s;t be firm, &s;teady, and diligent, &s;upe|rior
<PB N="18" REF="21">
to difficulties and dangers, and equally &s;uperior to the allurements of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure. For want of the&s;e moral qualities, many per&s;ons of ex|alted minds and great talents have failed to de&s;erve the title of great men. It is in vain that the French poets and hi&s;torians have decorated Henry the fourth with the name of Great; his facility of di&s;po&s;ition and uncontroul|able love of plea&s;ure have cau&s;ed him to forfeit his claim to it in the e&s;ti|mation of impartial judges. As power is e&s;&s;ential to greatne&s;s, a man can|not be great without <HI>power over him&s;elf,</HI> which is the highe&s;t kind of power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>After all, is it not better to be a good man than a great one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is more merit in be|ing a good man, becau&s;e it is what we make our&s;elves, whereas the talents that produce greatne&s;s are the gift of nature; though they may be improved by our own efforts, they cannot be
<PB N="19" REF="22">
acquired. But if goodne&s;s is the pro|per object of our love and e&s;teem, greatne&s;s de&s;erves our high admiration and re&s;pect. This Mr. Brindley before us, is by all accounts a worthy man, but it is not for that rea&s;on I have brought you to &s;ee him. I wi&s;h you to look upon him as one of tho&s;e &s;ub|lime and uncommon objects of nature which fill the mind with a certain awe and a&s;toni&s;hment. Next to being great one&s;elf, it is de&s;irable to have a true reli&s;h for greatne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>ORDER AND DISORDER,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FAIRY TALE.</HEAD>
<P>JULIET was a clever well-di&s;po&s;ed girl, but apt to be heedle&s;s. She could do her le&s;&s;ons very well, but commonly as much time was taken up in getting
<PB N="20" REF="23">
her things together, as in doing what &s;he was &s;et about. If &s;he was to work, there was generally the hou&s;ewife to &s;eek in one place, and the threadpapers in another. The &s;ci&s;&s;ars were left in her pockets up &s;tairs, and the thimble was rolling about the floor. In writ|ing, the copy-book was generally mi&s;&s;|ing, the ink dried up, and the pens, new and old, all tumbled about the cupboard. The &s;late and &s;late-pencil were never found together. In mak|ing her exerci&s;es, the Engli&s;h dic|tionary always came to hand in&s;tead of the French grammar; and when &s;he was to read a chapter, &s;he u&s;ually got hold of Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, or the World Di&s;played, in&s;tead of the Te&s;|tament.</P>
<P>Juliet's mamma was almo&s;t tired of teaching her, &s;o &s;he &s;ent her to make a vi&s;it to an old lady in the country, a very good woman, but rather &s;trict with young folks. Here &s;he was &s;hut
<PB N="21" REF="24">
up in a room above &s;tairs by her&s;elf after breakfa&s;t every day, till &s;he had quite fini&s;hed the ta&s;ks &s;et her. This hou&s;e was one of the very few that are &s;till haunted with fairies. One of the&s;e, who&s;e name was <HI>Di&s;order,</HI> took a plea|&s;ure in plaguing poor Juliet. She was a frightful figure to look at; be|ing crooked and &s;quint-eyed, with her hair hanging about her face, and her dre&s;s put on all awry, and full of rents and tatters. She prevailed on the old lady to let her &s;et Juliet her ta&s;ks; &s;o one morning &s;he came up with a work-bag full of threads of &s;ilk of all &s;orts of colours, mixed and entangled together, and a flower very nicely worked to copy. It was a pan&s;ie, and the gra|dual melting of its hues into one ano|ther was imitated with great accuracy and beauty. <Q REND="inline">"Here, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"my mi&s;tre&s;s has &s;ent you a piece of work to do, and &s;he in&s;i&s;ts upon hav|ing it done before you come down to
<PB N="22" REF="25">
dinner. You will find all the materials in this bag."</Q></P>
<P>Juliet took the flower and the bag, and turned out all the &s;ilks upon the table. She &s;lowly pulled out a red, and a purple, and a blue, and a yellow, and at length fixed upon one to begin working with. After taking two or three &s;titches, and looking at her model, &s;he found ano|ther &s;hade was wanted. This was to be hunted out from the bunch, and a long while it took her to find it. It was &s;oon nece&s;&s;ary to change it for ano|ther. Juliet &s;aw that in going on at this rate it would take days in&s;tead of hours to work the flower, &s;o &s;he laid down the needle and fell a crying. Af|ter this had continued &s;ome time, &s;he was &s;tartled at the &s;ound of &s;omewhat &s;tamp &s;tamping on the floor; and tak|ing her handkerchief from her eyes, &s;he &s;pied a neat diminutive female figure advancing towards her. She was as up|right as an arrow, and had not &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="26">
much as a hair out of its place, or the lea&s;t article of her dre&s;s rumpled or di&s;compo&s;ed. When &s;he came up to Juliet, <Q REND="inline">"My dear,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I heard your crying, and knowing you to be a good girl in the main, I am come to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. My name is <HI>Order;</HI> your mamma is well acquaint|ed with me, though this is the fir&s;t time you ever &s;aw me. But I hope we &s;hall know one another better for the future."</Q> She then jumped upon the table, and with a wand gave a tap upon the heap of entangled &s;ilk. Im|mediately the threads &s;eparated, and arranged them&s;elves in a long row con|&s;i&s;ting of little &s;keins in which all of the &s;ame colour were collected toge|ther, tho&s;e approaching neare&s;t in &s;hade being placed next each other. This done, &s;he di&s;appeared. Juliet, as &s;oon as her &s;urpri&s;e was over, re|&s;umed her work, and found it go on with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure. She fini&s;hed
<PB N="24" REF="27">
the flower by dinner-time, and obtain|ed great prai&s;e for the neatne&s;s of the execution.</P>
<P>The next day, the ill-natured fairy came up with a great book under her arm. <Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is my mi&s;|tre&s;s's hou&s;e-book, and &s;he &s;ays you mu&s;t draw out again&s;t dinner an exact account of what it has co&s;t her la&s;t year in all the articles of hou&s;ekeeping, including clothes, rent, taxes, wages, and the like. You mu&s;t &s;tate &s;epa|rately the amount of every article un|der the heads of baker, butcher, mil|liner, &s;hoemaker, and &s;o forth, tak|ing &s;pecial care not to mi&s;s a &s;ingle thing entered down in the book. Here is a quire of paper and a parcel of pens."</Q> So &s;aying, with a malicious grin &s;he left her.</P>
<P>Juliet turned pale at the very thought of the ta&s;k &s;he had to perform. She opened the great book and &s;aw all the pages clo&s;ely written, but in
<PB N="25" REF="28">
the mo&s;t confu&s;ed manner po&s;&s;ible. Here was, <Q REND="inline">"Paid Mr. Cru&s;ty for a week's bread and baking, &s;o much."</Q> Then, <Q REND="inline">"Paid Mr. Pinchtoe for &s;hoes &s;o much."</Q><Q REND="inline">&mdash;"Paid half a year's rent, &s;o much."</Q> Then came a butcher's bill, &s;ucceeded by a milliner's, and that by a tallow-chandler's. <Q REND="inline">"What &s;hall I do?"</Q> cried poor Juliet&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"where am I to begin, and how can I po&s;&s;ibly pick out all the&s;e things? Was ever &s;uch a tedious perplexing ta&s;k? O that my good little creature were here again with her wand!"</Q></P>
<P>She had but ju&s;t uttered the words when the fairy <HI>Order</HI> &s;tood before her. <Q REND="inline">"Don't be &s;tartled, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I knew your wi&s;h, and made ha&s;te to comply with it. Let me &s;ee your book."</Q> She turned over a few leaves, and then cried, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee my cro&s;s-grained &s;i&s;ter has played you a trick. She has brought you the <HI>day-book</HI> in|&s;tead of the <HI>ledger;</HI> but I will &s;et the
<PB N="26" REF="29">
matter to rights in&s;tantly."</Q> She va|ni&s;hed, and pre&s;ently returned with another book, in which &s;he &s;howed Juliet every one of the articles requir|ed &s;tanding at the tops of the pages, and all the particulars entered under them from the day-book; &s;o that there was nothing for her to do but ca&s;t up the &s;ums and copy out the heads with their amount in &s;ingle lines. As Ju|liet was a ready accountant, &s;he was not long in fini&s;hing the bu&s;ine&s;s, and produced her account neatly writ|ten on one &s;heet of paper, at dinner.</P>
<P>The next day, Juliet's tormentor brought her up a large box full of let|ters &s;tamped upon &s;mall bits of ivory, capitals and common letters of all &s;orts, but jumbled together promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly as if they had been &s;haken in a bag. <Q REND="inline">"Now, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"be|fore you come down to dinner, you mu&s;t exactly copy out this poem in the&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="30">
ivory letters, placing them, line by line, on the floor of your room."</Q></P>
<P>Juliet thought at fir&s;t that this ta&s;k would be pretty &s;port enough; but when &s;he &s;et about it, &s;he found &s;uch trouble in hunting out the letters &s;he wanted, every one &s;eeming to come to hand before the right one, that &s;he proceeded very &s;lowly; and the poem being a long one, it was plain that night would come before it was fini&s;h|ed. Sitting down, and crying for her kind friend, was therefore her only re|&s;ource.</P>
<P><HI>Order</HI> was not far di&s;tant, for, in|deed, &s;he had been watching her pro|ceedings all the while. She made her&s;elf vi&s;ible, and giving a tap on the letters with her wand, they imme|diately arranged them&s;elves alphabeti|cally in little double heaps, the &s;mall in one, and the great in the other. After this operation, Juliet's ta&s;k went on with &s;uch expedition, that &s;he called
<PB N="28" REF="31">
up the old lady an hour before dinner, to be witne&s;s to its completion.</P>
<P>The good lady ki&s;&s;ed her, and told her, that as &s;he hoped &s;he was now made fully &s;en&s;ible of the benefits of order, and the inconveniences of di&s;order, &s;he would not confine her any longer to work by her&s;elf at &s;et ta&s;ks, but &s;he &s;hould come and &s;it with her. Ju|liet took &s;uch pains to plea&s;e her by doing every thing with the greate&s;t neatne&s;s and regularity, and reforming all her carele&s;s habits, that when &s;he was &s;ent back to her mother, the fol|lowing pre&s;ents were made her, in order con&s;tantly to remind her of the beauty and advantage of order.</P>

<HEAD>TWENTY-SEVENTH EVENING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="piece">
<HEAD>THE FOUR SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>I AM one of four Si&s;ters; and hav|ing &s;ome rea&s;on to think my&s;elf not well u&s;ed either by them or by the world, I beg leave to lay before you a &s;ketch of our hi&s;tory and characters. You will not wonder there &s;hould be frequent bickerings among&s;t us, when I tell you that in our infancy we were continually fighting; and &s;o great was the noi&s;e, and din, and confu&s;ion, in our continual &s;truggles to get upper-mo&s;t, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any body to live among&s;t us in &s;uch a &s;cene of tumult and di&s;order&mdash;The&s;e brawls, however, by a powerful inter|po&s;ition, were put an end to; our proper place was a&s;&s;igned to each of us, and we had &s;trict orders not to
<PB N="31" REF="34">
encroach on the limits of each others property, but to join our common of|fices for the good of the whole fa|mily.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t &s;i&s;ter, (I call her the fir&s;t, becau&s;e we have generally allowed her the precedence in rank,) is, I mu&s;t acknowledge, of a very active &s;prightly di&s;po&s;ition; quick and lively, and has more brilliancy than any of us: but &s;he is hot: every thing &s;erves for fuel to her fury when it is once rai&s;ed to a certain degree, and &s;he is &s;o mi&s;chie|vous whenever &s;he gets the upper hand, that, notwith&s;tanding her a&s;pir|ing di&s;po&s;ition, if I may freely &s;peak my mind, &s;he is calculated to make a good &s;ervant, but a very bad mi&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to mention, that notwith&s;tanding her &s;eeming delicacy, &s;he has a mo&s;t voracious appetite, and devours every thing that comes in her way; though, like other eager thin peo|ple,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
&s;he does no credit to her keeping. Many a time has &s;he con&s;umed the product of my barns and &s;torehou&s;es, but it is all lo&s;t upon her. She has even been known to get into an oil-&s;hop or tallow-chandler's when every body was a&s;leep, and lick up with the utmo&s;t greedine&s;s whatever &s;he found there. Indeed, all prudent people are aware of her tricks, and though &s;he is admitted into the be&s;t families, they take care to watch her very narrowly. I &s;hould not forget to mention, that my &s;i&s;ter was once in a country where &s;he was treated with uncommon re|&s;pect; &s;he was lodged in a &s;umptuous building, and had a number of young women of the be&s;t families to attend on her, and feed her, and watch over her health: in &s;hort, &s;he was looked upon as &s;omething more than a com|mon mortal. But &s;he always behaved with great &s;everity to her maids, and if any of them were negligent of their
<PB N="33" REF="36">
duty, or made a &s;lip in their own con|duct, nothing would &s;erve her but burying the poor girls alive. I have my&s;elf had &s;ome dark hints and inti|mations from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable au|thority, that &s;he will &s;ome time or other make an end of me. You need not wonder, therefore, if I am jealous of her motions.</P>
<P>The next &s;i&s;ter I &s;hall mention to you, has &s;o far the appearance of Mo|de&s;ty and Humility, that &s;he generally &s;eeks the lowe&s;t place. She is indeed of a very yielding ea&s;y temper, gene|rally cool, and often wears a &s;weet placid &s;mile upon her countenance; but &s;he is ea&s;ily ruffled, and when worked up, as &s;he often is, by another &s;i&s;ter, whom I &s;hall mention to you by and by, &s;he becomes a perfect fury. Indeed &s;he is &s;o apt to &s;well with &s;ud|den gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he is &s;u&s;|pected at times to be a little lunatic. Between her and my fir&s;t mentioned
<PB N="34" REF="37">
&s;i&s;ter, there is a more &s;ettled antipathy than between the Theban pair; and they never meet without making ef|forts to de&s;troy one another. With me &s;he is always ready to form the mo&s;t intimate union, but it is not always to my advantage. There goes a &s;tory in our family, that when we were all young, &s;he once attempted to drown me. She actually kept me under a con&s;iderable time, and though at length I got my head above water, my con&s;titution is generally thought to have been e&s;&s;entially injured by it ever &s;ince. From that time &s;he has made no &s;uch atrocious attempt, but &s;he is continually making encroach|ments upon my property; and even when &s;he appears mo&s;t gentle, &s;he is very in&s;idious, and has &s;uch an under|mining way with her, that her in&s;inuat|ing arts are as much to be dreaded as open violence. I might indeed remon&s;trate, but it is a known part of her charac|ter,
<PB N="35" REF="38">
that nothing makes any la&s;ting im|pre&s;&s;ion upon her.</P>
<P>As to my third &s;i&s;ter, I have al|ready mentioned the ill offices &s;he does me with my la&s;t mentioned one, who is entirely under her influence. She is be&s;ides of a very uncertain va|riable temper, &s;ometimes hot, and &s;ometimes cold, nobody knows where to have her. Her lightne&s;s is even proverbial, and &s;he has nothing to give tho&s;e who live with her more &s;ub&s;tantial than the &s;miles of courtiers. I mu&s;t add, that &s;he keeps in her &s;ervice three or four rough blu&s;tering bullies with puffed cheeks, who, when they are let loo&s;e, think they have no|thing to do but to drive the world before them. She &s;ometimes joins with my fir&s;t &s;i&s;ter, and their violence occa&s;ionally throws me into &s;uch a trembling, that, though naturally of a firm con&s;titution, I &s;hake as if I was in an ague fit.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39">
As to my&s;elf, I am of a &s;teady &s;olid temper; not &s;hining indeed, but kind and liberal, quite a Lady Bountiful. Every one ta&s;tes of my beneficence, and I am of &s;o grateful a di&s;po&s;ition, that I have been known to return an hundred-fold for any pre&s;ent that has been made me. I feed and clothe all my children, and afford a welcome home to the wretch who has no other home. I bear with unrepining pa|tience all manner of ill u&s;age; I am trampled upon, I am torn and wound|ed with the mo&s;t cutting &s;trokes; I am pillaged of the trea&s;ures hidden in my mo&s;t &s;ecret chambers; notwith&s;tanding which, I am always ready to return good for evil, and am continually &s;ub|&s;ervient to the plea&s;ure or advantage of others; yet, &s;o ungrateful is the world, that becau&s;e I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s all the airine&s;s and activity of my &s;i&s;|ters, I am &s;tigmati&s;ed as dull and hea|vy. Every &s;ordid mi&s;erly fellow is

called by way of deri&s;ion one of <HI>my</HI> children; and if a per&s;on on entering a room does but turn his eyes upon me, he is thought &s;tupid and mean, and not fit for good company. I have the &s;atisfaction, however, of finding that people always incline towards me as they grow older; and that tho&s;e who &s;eemed proudly to di&s;dain any affinity with me, are content to &s;ink at la&s;t into my bo&s;om. You will proba|bly wi&s;h to have &s;ome account of my per&s;on. I am not a regular beauty; &s;ome of my features are rather har&s;h and prominent, when viewed &s;eparately; but my countenance has &s;o much va|riety of expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o many dif|ferent attitudes of elegance, that tho&s;e who &s;tudy my face with attention, find out continually new charms; and it may be truly &s;aid of me, what Titus &s;ays of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and for a much longer &s;pace,<Q><PB N="38" REF="41">

<HEAD>THE POWER OF HABIT.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM was one day reading in a book of travels to his father, when he came to the following relation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Andes in South America are the highe&s;t ridge of mountains in the known world. There is a road over them, on which, about half way be|tween the &s;ummit and the foot, is a hou&s;e of entertainment, where it is common for travellers in their a&s;cent and de&s;cent to meet. The difference in their feelings upon the &s;ame &s;pot is very remarkable. Tho&s;e who are de&s;cending the mountain are melting with heat, &s;o that they can &s;carcely bear any clothes upon them; while tho&s;e who are a&s;cending, &s;hiver with cold, and wrap them&s;elves up in the warme&s;t garments they have."</Q></P>
<P>How &s;trange this is! (cried Wil|liam) What can be the rea&s;on of it?</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43">
It is (replied his father) a &s;triking in&s;tance of the <HI>power of habit</HI> over the body. The cold is &s;o inten&s;e on the tops of the&s;e mountains, that it is as much as travellers can do to keep them&s;elves from being frozen to death. Their bodies, therefore, become &s;o habituated to the &s;en&s;ation of cold, that every diminution of it as they de|&s;cend &s;eems to them a degree of actual heat; and when they are got half way down, they feel as if they were quite in a &s;ultry climate. On the other hand, the vallies at the foot of the mountains are &s;o exce&s;&s;ively hot, that the body becomes relaxed, and &s;en&s;ible to the &s;lighte&s;t degree of cold; &s;o that when a traveller a&s;cends from them towards the hills, the middle re|gions appear quite inclement from their coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>And does the &s;ame thing (rejoined William) always happen in cro&s;&s;ing high mountains?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">
It does (returned his father) in a degree proportioned to their height, and the time taken in cro&s;&s;ing them. Indeed a &s;hort time is &s;ufficient to produce &s;imilar effects. Let one boy have been playing at rolling &s;nowballs, and another have been roa&s;ting him|&s;elf before a great fire, and let them meet in the porch of the hou&s;e;&mdash;if you a&s;k them how they feel, I will an&s;wer for it you will find them as different in their accounts as the tra|vellers on the Andes. But this is only one example of the operation of an univer&s;al principle belonging to hu|man nature; for the power of habit is the &s;ame thing whatever be the circum|&s;tance which calls it forth, whether relating to the mind or the body.</P>
<P>You may con&s;ider the &s;tory you have been reading as a &s;ort of &s;imile or parable. The central &s;tation on the mountain may be re&s;embled to <HI>middle life.</HI> With what different feelings is
<PB N="42" REF="45">
this regarded by tho&s;e who ba&s;k in the &s;un&s;hine of opulence, and tho&s;e who &s;hrink under the cold bla&s;ts of penury!</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the wealthy duke, our neighbour, were &s;uddenly obliged to de&s;cend to our level, and live as we do&mdash;to part with all his carriages, &s;ell his coach-hor&s;es and hunters, quit his noble &s;eat with its fine park and gar|dens, di&s;mi&s;s all his train of &s;ervants except two or three, and take a hou&s;e like ours. What a dreadful fall would it &s;eem to him! how wretched would it probably make him, and how much would he be pitied by the world!</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;uppo&s;e the la|bourer who lives in the next cottage were unexpectedly to fall heir to an e&s;tate of a few hundreds a year, and in con&s;equence to get around him all the comforts and conveniences that we po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;a commodious hou&s;e to inhabit, good clothes to wear, plenty
<PB N="43" REF="46">
of whole&s;ome food and firing, &s;ervants to do all the drudgery of the family, and the like;&mdash;how all his acquaint|ance would congratulate him, and what a paradi&s;e would he &s;eem to him|&s;elf to be got into! Yet he, and the duke, and our&s;elves, are equally <HI>men,</HI> made liable by nature to the &s;ame de|&s;ires and nece&s;&s;ities, and perhaps all equally &s;trong in con&s;titution, and ca|pable of &s;upporting hard&s;hips. Is not this fully as wonderful a difference in feeling as that on cro&s;&s;ing the Andes?</P>
<P>Indeed it is (&s;aid William).</P>
<P>And the cau&s;e of it mu&s;t be exactly the &s;ame&mdash;the influence of habit.</P>
<P>I think &s;o.</P>
<P>Of what importance then mu&s;t it be towards a happy life, to regulate our habits &s;o, that in the po&s;&s;ible changes of this world we may be more likely to be gainers than lo&s;ers?</P>
<P>But how can this be done? Would
<PB N="44" REF="47">
it be right for the duke to live like us, or us like the labourer?</P>
<P>Certainly not. But to apply the ca&s;e to per&s;ons of our middle condi|tion, I would have us u&s;e our advan|tages in &s;uch a frugal manner, as to make them as little as po&s;&s;ible e&s;&s;en|tial to our happine&s;s, &s;hould fortune &s;ink us to a lower &s;tation. For as to the chance of ri&s;ing to a higher, there is no need to prepare our habits for that&mdash;we &s;hould readily enough accommodate our feelings to &s;uch a change. To be plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied with &s;imple food, to accu&s;tom our|&s;elves not to &s;hrink from the inclemen|cies of the &s;ea&s;ons, to avoid indolence, and take delight in &s;ome u&s;eful em|ployment of the mind or body, to do as much as we can for our&s;elves, and not expect to be waited upon on every &s;mall occa&s;ion&mdash;the&s;e are the habits which will make us in &s;ome
<PB N="45" REF="48">
mea&s;ure independent of fortune, and &s;ecure us a moderate degree of enjoy|ment under every change &s;hort of ab|&s;olute want. I will tell you a &s;tory to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A London merchant had two &s;ons, James and Richard. James from a boy accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to every indul|gence in his power, and when he grew up, was quite a fine gentleman. He dre&s;&s;ed expen&s;ively, frequented public diver&s;ions, kept his hunter at a livery &s;table, and was a member of &s;everal convivial clubs. At home, it was al|mo&s;t a footman's &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s to wait on him. He would have thought it greatly beneath him to buckle his own &s;hoes; and if he wanted anything at the other end of the room, he would ring the bell, and bring a &s;ervant up two pair of &s;tairs, rather than ri&s;e from his chair to fetch it. He did a little bu&s;ine&s;s in the counting-hou&s;e on forenoons, but devoted all his
<PB N="46" REF="49">
time after dinner to indolence and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Richard was a very different cha|racter. He was plain in his appear|ance, and dome&s;tic in his way of life. He gave as little trouble as po&s;&s;ible, and would have been a&s;hamed to a&s;k a&s;&s;i&s;tance in doing what he could ea&s;ily do for him&s;elf. He was a&s;&s;iduous in bu&s;ine&s;s, and employed his lei&s;ure hours chiefly in reading and acquiring u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P>Both were &s;till young and un&s;ettled when their father died, leaving be|hind him a very trifling property. As the young men had not a capital &s;ufficient to follow the &s;ame line of mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s in which he had been engaged, they were obliged to look out for a new plan of mainte|nance; and a great reduction of ex|pence was the fir&s;t thing requi&s;ite. This was a &s;evere &s;troke to James, who found him&s;elf at once cut off from all
<PB N="47" REF="50">
the plea&s;ures and indulgencies to which he was &s;o habituated, that he thought life of no value without them. He grew melancholy and dejected, ha|zarded all his little property in lottery tickets, and was quite beggared. Still unable to think of retrieving him&s;elf by indu&s;try and frugality, he accepted a commi&s;&s;ion in a new rai&s;ed regiment ordered for the We&s;t Indies, where &s;oon after his arrival he caught a fever and died.</P>
<P>Richard, in the mean time, who&s;e comforts were little impaired by this change of &s;ituation, pre&s;erved his cheerfulne&s;s, and found no difficulty in accommodating him&s;elf to his for|tune. He engaged him&s;elf as clerk in a hou&s;e his father had been con|nected with, and lived as frugally as po&s;&s;ible upon his &s;alary. It furni&s;hed him with decent board, lodging, and cloathing, which was all he required, and his hours of lei&s;ure were nearly
<PB N="48" REF="51">
as many as before. A book or a &s;ober friend always &s;ufficed to pro|cure him an agreeable evening. He gradually ro&s;e in the confidence of his employers, who increa&s;ed from time to time his &s;alary and emolu|ments. Every increa&s;e was a &s;ource of gratification to him, becau&s;e he was able to enjoy plea&s;ures which how|ever habit had not made nece&s;&s;ary to his comfort. In proce&s;s of time he was enabled to &s;ettle for him&s;elf, and pa&s;&s;ed through life in the enjoyment of that mode&s;t competence which be&s;t &s;uited his di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. And as we are &s;o con&s;tituted that we cannot be happy our&s;elves without making others happy, the be&s;t end of living is to produce as much general happine&s;s as lies in our power.</P>

<P>It is; and therefore wi&s;dom includes goodne&s;s. The wi&s;e man always intends what is good, and em|ploys &s;kill or judgment in attaining it. If he were to pur&s;ue the be&s;t things

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Few men have &s;ucceed|ed more perfectly in &s;ecuring their own happine&s;s, and promoting that of tho&s;e around them. Born to a competent e&s;tate, he early &s;ettled upon it, and began to improve it. He reduced all his expences within his income, and indulged no ta&s;tes that could lead him into exce&s;&s;es of any kind. At the &s;ame time, he did not refu&s;e any proper and innocent plea&s;ures that came in his way; and his hou&s;e has al|ways been di&s;tingui&s;hed for decent cheerfulne&s;s and ho&s;pitality. He ap|plied him&s;elf with diligence to mend|ing the morals and improving the condition of his dependents. He &s;tu|died attentively the laws of his coun|try,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
and qualified him&s;elf for admini&s;|tering ju&s;tice with &s;kill and fidelity. No one &s;ooner di&s;covers where the right lies, or takes &s;urer means to enforce it. He is the per&s;on to whom the neighbours of all degrees apply for coun&s;el in their difficulties. His conduct is always con&s;i&s;tent and uni|form&mdash;never violent, never ra&s;h, ne|ver in extremes, but always deliberat|ing before he acts, and then acting with firmne&s;s and vigour. The peace and good order of the whole neigh|bourhood materially depend upon him; and upon every emergency his opinion is the fir&s;t thing enquired after. He enjoys the re&s;pect of the rich, the confidence of the poor, and the good will of both.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harpy has a good natural under&s;tanding, a clear head, and a cool temper; but his only end in life has been to rai&s;e a fortune by ba&s;e and di&s;hone&s;t means. Being tho|roughly acquainted with all the tricks and artifices of the law, he employed his knowledge to take undue advan|tages of all who entru&s;ted him with the management of their affairs; and un|der colour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, he con|trived to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their property. Thus he has become ex|tremely rich, lives in a great hou&s;e with a number of &s;ervants, is even vi&s;ited by per&s;ons of rank, yet is uni|ver&s;ally dete&s;ted and de&s;pi&s;ed, and has not a friend in the world.

of this, and is wretched. Su&s;|picion and remor&s;e continually prey upon his mind. Of all whom he has cheated, he has deceived him&s;elf the mo&s;t; and has proved him&s;elf as much a fool in the end he has pur&s;ued, as a knave in the means.</P>

<P>A philo&s;opher is properly <HI>a lover of wi&s;dom;</HI> and if he &s;earches after it with a right di&s;po&s;ition, he will probably find it oftener than other men. But he mu&s;t practi&s;e as well as know, in order to be truly wi&s;e.</P>

But a wi&s;er than them all was Socrates, who&s;e chief prai&s;e it was that he turned philo&s;ophy from vain and fruitle&s;s di&s;|putation, to the regulation of life and manners, and that he was him&s;elf a great example of the wi&s;dom he taught.</P>

<P>In my opinion, few wi&s;er men have ever exi&s;ted than the late Dr. Franklin, the American. From
<PB N="55" REF="58">
the low &s;tation of a journey man printer, to the elevated one of amba&s;&s;ador ple|nipotentiary from his country to the court of France, he always di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by &s;agacity in di&s;co|very, and good &s;en&s;e in practi&s;ing, what was mo&s;t beneficial to him&s;elf and others. He was a great natural philo|&s;opher, and made &s;ome very brilliant di&s;coveries, but it was ever his favou|rite purpo&s;e to turn every thing to u&s;e, and to extract &s;ome practical ad|vantage from his &s;peculations. He thoroughly under&s;tood <HI>common life,</HI> and all that conduces to its comfort; and he has left behind him trea&s;ures of dome&s;tic wi&s;dom, &s;uperior, perhaps, to any of the boa&s;ted maxims of anti|quity. He never let &s;lip any oppor|tunity of improving his knowledge whether of great things or of &s;mall; and was equally ready to conver&s;e with a day-labourer and a prime-mini&s;ter upon topics from which he might de|rive
<PB N="56" REF="59">
in&s;truction. He ro&s;e to wealth, but obtained by honourable means. He prolonged his life by temperance to a great age, and enjoyed it to the la&s;t. Few men knew more than he, and none employed knowledge to bet|ter purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>O yes&mdash;it begins<Q>Remote from cities liv'd a &s;wain.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. He is repre&s;ented as drawing all his maxims of conduct from ob&s;ervation of brute animals. And they, indeed, have univer&s;ally that character

of wi&s;dom, of pur&s;uing the ends be&s;t &s;uited to them by the propere&s;t means. But this is owing to the impul&s;e of unerring in&s;tinct.

<HEAD>THE BULLIES.</HEAD>
<P>As young Francis was walking through a village with his tutor, they were annoyed by two or three cur dogs, that came running after them with looks of the utmo&s;t fury, &s;narling and barking as if they would tear their throats, and &s;eeming every mo|ment
<PB N="58" REF="61">
ready to fly upon them. Fran|cis every now and then &s;topped, and &s;hook his &s;tick at them, or &s;tooped down to pick up a &s;tone; upon which the curs retreated as fa&s;t as they came; but as &s;oon as he turned about, they were after his heels again. This la&s;ted till they came to a farm-yard through which their road lay. A large ma&s;tiff was lying down in it at his ea&s;e in the &s;un. Francis was al|mo&s;t afraid to pa&s;s him, and kept as clo&s;e to his tutor as po&s;&s;ible. How|ever, the dog took not the lea&s;t notice of them.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently they came upon a com|mon, where going near a flock of gee&s;e, they were a&s;&s;ailed with hi&s;&s;ings, and pur&s;ued &s;ome way by the&s;e fooli&s;h birds, which &s;tretching out their long necks made a very ridiculous figure. Francis only laughed at them, though he was tempted to give the foremo&s;t a &s;witch acro&s;s his neck. A little fur|ther
<PB N="59" REF="62">
was a herd of cows with a bull among them, upon which Francis looked with &s;ome degree of apprehen|&s;ion; but they kept quietly grazing, and did not take their heads from the ground as he pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is a lucky thing, &s;aid Francis to his tutor, that ma&s;tiffs and bulls are not &s;o quarrel&s;ome as curs and gee&s;e; but what can be the rea&s;on of it?</P>
<P>The rea&s;on (replied his tutor) is, that paltry and contemptible animals, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no confidence in their own &s;trength and courage, and knowing them&s;elves liable to injury from mo&s;t of tho&s;e that come in their way, think it &s;afe&s;t to act the part of bullies, and to make a &s;how of attacking tho&s;e of whom in reality they are afraid. Whereas animals which are con&s;cious of force &s;ufficient for their own pro|tection, &s;u&s;pecting no evil de&s;igns from others, entertain none them|&s;elves,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
but maintain a dignified com|po&s;ure.</P>
<P>Thus you will find it among man|kind. Weak, mean, petty characters are &s;u&s;picious, &s;narling, and petulant. They rai&s;e an outcry again&s;t their &s;u|periors in talents and reputation, of whom they &s;tand in awe, and put on airs of defiance and in&s;olence through mere cowardice. But the truly great are calm and inoffen&s;ive. They fear no injury, and offer none. They even &s;uffer &s;light attacks to go unnoticed, con&s;cious of their power to right them|&s;elves whenever the occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;eem to require it.</P>

<HEAD>A FRIEND IN NEED.</HEAD>
<P>GEORGE CORNISH, a native of London, was brought up to the &s;ea. After making &s;everal voyages to the Ea&s;t Indies in the capacity of mate, he obtained the command of a &s;hip in the country trade there, and pa&s;&s;ed many years of his life in &s;ailing from one port to another of the Company's different &s;ettlements, and re&s;iding at intervals on &s;hore with the &s;uperin|tendance of their commercial con|cerns. Having by the&s;e means rai&s;ed a moderate fortune, and being now beyond the meridian of life, he felt a &s;trong de&s;ire of returning to his native country, and &s;eeing his family and
<PB N="62" REF="65">
friends, concerning whom he had re|ceived no tidings for a long time. He realized his property, &s;ettled his af|fairs, and taking his pa&s;&s;age for Eng|land, arrived in the Downs after an ab&s;ence of &s;ixteen years.</P>
<P>He immediately repaired to London, and went to the hou&s;e of an only bro|ther whom he had left po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a genteel place in a public office. He found that his brother was dead and the family broken up; and he was directed to the hou&s;e of one of his nieces, who was married and &s;ettled at a &s;mall di&s;tance from town. On making him&s;elf known, he was re|ceived with great re&s;pect and affection by the married niece, and a &s;ingle &s;i&s;|ter who re&s;ided with her: to which good reception, the idea of his bring|ing back with him a large fortune, did not a little contribute. They pre&s;&s;ed him in the mo&s;t urgent manner to take up his abode there, and omitted no|thing
<PB N="63" REF="66">
that could te&s;tify their dutiful regard to &s;o near a relation. On his part, he was &s;incerely glad to &s;ee them, and pre&s;ented them with &s;ome valuable Indian commodities which he had brought with him. They &s;oon fell into conver&s;ation concerning the family events that had taken place during his long ab&s;ence. Mutual condolences pa&s;&s;ed on the death of the father; the mother had been dead long before. The captain, in the warmth of his heart, declared his intention of be|friending the &s;urvivors of the family, and his wi&s;hes of &s;eeing the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter as comfortably &s;ettled in the world as the fir&s;t &s;eemed to be.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But (&s;aid he) are you two the only ones left? What is become of my little &s;miling playfellow <HI>Amelia?</HI> I remember her as if it were ye&s;terday, coming behind my chair, and giving me a &s;ly pull, and then running away that I might follow her for a ki&s;s. I

But who was the man, and what did my brother &s;ay to it?"</Q>
<PB N="65" REF="68">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I cannot &s;ay, but it was partly my father's own fault; for he took a &s;ort of liking to the young man, who was a drawing-ma&s;ter employed in the family, and would not forbid him the hou&s;e after we had informed him of the danger of an attachment between Amelia and him. So when it was too late, he fell into a violent pa&s;|&s;ion about it, which had no other effect than to drive the girl directly into her lover's arms. They married, and &s;oon fell into difficulties. My father, of cour&s;e, would do nothing for them; and when he died, he not only di&s;|inherited her, but made us promi&s;e no longer to look upon her as a &s;i&s;ter."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"And you <HI>did</HI> make that promi&s;e?"</Q> &s;aid the captain in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;plea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"We could not di&s;obey our parent (replied the other &s;i&s;ter); but we have &s;everal times &s;ent her relief in her nece&s;&s;ities, though it was improper for us to &s;ee her."</Q>

My &s;ervant &s;hall make all the enquiries you choo&s;e, and &s;ave you the trouble; and to-morrow you can ride to town, and do as you think proper."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"My good niece, (&s;aid the

You will excu&s;e me."</Q> So &s;aying, he took up his hat, and without much ceremony went out of the hou&s;e, and took the road to town on foot, leaving his two nieces &s;omewhat di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>When he arrived, he went without delay to the place mentioned, which was a bye &s;treet near Soho. The people who kept the lodgings inform|ed him, that the per&s;ons he enquired after had left them &s;everal months, and they did not know what was be|come of them. This threw the cap|tain into great perplexity; but while he was con&s;idering what he &s;hould do next, the woman of the hou&s;e recol|lected that Mr. Bland (that was the drawing ma&s;ter's name) had been em|ployed at a certain &s;chool, where in|formation
<PB N="68" REF="71">
about him might po&s;&s;ibly be obtained. Captain Corni&s;h ha&s;tened away to the place, and was informed by the ma&s;ter of the &s;chool that &s;uch a man had, indeed, been engaged there, but had cea&s;ed to attend for &s;ome time pa&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"He was a very well-behaved indu&s;trious young man (added the ma&s;ter), but in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, which prevented him from making that genteel appearance which we expect in all who attend our &s;chool; &s;o I was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s him. It was a great force upon my <HI>feelings,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, to do &s;o, but you know the thing could not be helped."</Q> The captain eyed him with indignant contempt, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e then, Sir, your <HI>feelings</HI> never &s;uffered you to enquire where this poor creature lodged, or what became of him afterwards!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"As to that, (replied the ma&s;ter) every man knows his own bu&s;ine&s;s be&s;t, and my time
<PB N="69" REF="72">
is fully taken up with my own con|cerns; but I believe I have a note of the lodgings he then occupied&mdash;here it is."</Q> The captain took it, and turn|ing on his heel, withdrew in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>He po&s;ted away to the place, but there too had the mortification of learning that he was too late. The people however told him that they be|lieved he might find the family he was &s;eeking in a neighbouring alley, at a lodging up three pair of &s;tairs. The captain's heart &s;unk within him; however, taking a boy as a guide, he proceeded immediately to the &s;pot. On going up the narrow creaking &s;tair|ca&s;e, he met a man coming down with a bed on his &s;houlders. At the top of the landing &s;tood another with a bundle of blankets and &s;heets. A woman with a child in her arms was expo&s;tulating with him, and he heard her exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"Cruel! not to leave me <HI>one</HI> bed for my&s;elf and my poor

children!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Stop (&s;aid the captain to the man) &s;et down tho&s;e things."</Q> The man he&s;itated. The captain re|newed his command in a peremtory tone; and then advanced towards the woman. They looked earne&s;tly at each other. Through her pale and emaciated features he &s;aw &s;omething of his little &s;miler; and at length, in a faint voice, he addre&s;&s;ed her, <Q REND="inline">"Are you Amelia Corni&s;h?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That <HI>was</HI> my name,"</Q> &s;he replied. <Q REND="inline">"I am your uncle,"</Q> he cried, cla&s;ping her in his arms, and &s;obbing as if his heart would break. <Q REND="inline">"My uncle!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, and fainted. He was ju&s;t able to &s;et her down on the only remaining chair, and take her child from her. Two other young children came running up, and began to &s;cream with terror. Amelia recovered her&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"Oh, Sir, what a &s;ituation you &s;ee me in!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"A &s;ituation, indeed! (&s;aid he) Poor for|&s;aken
<PB N="71" REF="74">
creature! but you have <HI>one</HI> friend left!"</Q></P>
<P>He then a&s;ked what was become of her hu&s;band. She told him, that hav|ing fatigued him&s;elf with walking every day to a great di&s;tance for a little employment, that &s;carcely af|forded them bread, he had fallen ill, and was now in an ho&s;pital, and that after having been obliged to &s;ell mo&s;t of their little furniture and clothes for pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, their landlord had ju&s;t &s;eized their only remaining bed for &s;ome arrears of rent. The cap|tain immediately di&s;charged the debt, and cau&s;ing the bed to be brought up again, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the man. He then entered into a conver&s;ation with his niece about the events that had be|fallen her. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) I am &s;en&s;ible I was greatly to blame in di&s;obeying my father, and leaving his roof as I did; but perhaps &s;ome|thing might be alledged in my ex|cu&s;e&mdash;at
<PB N="72" REF="75">
lea&s;t, years of calamity and di&s;tre&s;s may be an expiation. As to my hu&s;band, however, he has never given me the lea&s;t cau&s;e of complaint&mdash;he has ever been kind and good, and what we have &s;uffered has been through misfortune and not fault. To be &s;ure, when we married, we did not con&s;ider how a family was to be maintained. His was a poor employ|ment, and &s;ickne&s;s and other acci|dents &s;oon brought us to a &s;tate of poverty, from which we could never retrieve our&s;elves. He, poor man! was never idle when he could help it, and denied him&s;elf every indulgence in order to provide for the wants of me and the children. I did my part, too, as well as I was able. But my father's unrelenting &s;everity made me quite heart-broken; and though my &s;i&s;ters two or three times gave us a little relief in our pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities&mdash;for nothing el&s;e could have made me
<PB N="73" REF="76">
a&s;k it in the manner I did&mdash;yet they would never permit me to &s;ee them, and for &s;ome time pa&s;t have entirely abandoned us. I thought heaven had abandoned us too. The hour of ex|treme&s;t di&s;tre&s;s was come; but <HI>you</HI> have been &s;ent for our comfort."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"And your comfort, plea&s;e God! I will be,"</Q> cried the captain with energy. <Q REND="inline">"You are my own dear child, and your little ones &s;hall be mine too. Dry up your tears&mdash;better days, I hope, are approaching."</Q></P>
<P>Evening was now coming on, and it was too late to think of changing lodgings. The captain procured a neighbour to go out for &s;ome provi|&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries, and then took his leave, with a promi&s;e of be|ing with his niece early the next morn|ing. Indeed, as he propo&s;ed going to pay a vi&s;it to her hu&s;band, &s;he was far from wi&s;hing to detain him longer. He went directly from thence to the
<PB N="74" REF="77">
ho&s;pital, and having got acce&s;s to the apothecary, begged to be informed of the real &s;tate of his patient Bland. The apothecary told him that he labour|ed under a &s;low fever, attended with ex|treme dejection of &s;pirits, but that there were no &s;igns of urgent danger. <Q REND="inline">"If you will allow me to &s;ee him (&s;aid the captain) I believe I &s;hall be able to admini&s;ter a cordial more effectual, perhaps, than all your medicines."</Q> He was &s;hewn up to the ward where the poor man lay, and &s;eated by his bed&s;ide. <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Bland (&s;aid he) I am a &s;tranger to you, but I come to bring you &s;ome news of your family."</Q> The &s;ick man rou&s;ed him&s;elf, as it were, from a &s;tupor, and fixed his eyes in &s;ilence on the captain. He proceeded&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Perhaps you may have heard of an uncle that your wife had in the Ea&s;t Indies&mdash;he is come home, and&mdash;and&mdash;I am he."</Q> Upon this he eagerly &s;tretched out his hand,
<PB N="75" REF="78">
and taking that of Bland, which was thru&s;t out of the bedclothes to meet it, gave it a cordial &s;hake. The &s;ick man's eyes gli&s;tened&mdash;he gra&s;ped the captain's hand with all his remaining &s;trength, and drawing it to his mouth, ki&s;&s;ed it with fervour. All he could &s;ay, was, <Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s you!&mdash;be kind to poor Amelia!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I will&mdash;I will&mdash;(cried the captain) I will be a father to you all&mdash;Cheer up&mdash;keep up your &s;pirits&mdash;all will be well!"</Q> He then, with a kind look and another &s;hake of the hand, wi&s;hed him a good night, and left the poor man lightened at once of half his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The captain went home to the cof|fee-hou&s;e where he lodged, got a light &s;upper, and went early to bed. After meditating &s;ome time with heart|felt &s;atisfaction on the work of the day, he fell into a &s;weet &s;leep which la&s;ted till day break. The next morn|ing early he ro&s;e and &s;allied forth in
<PB N="76" REF="79">
&s;earch of furni&s;hed lodgings. After &s;ome enquiry, he met with a commo|dious &s;et, in a plea&s;ant airy &s;ituation, for which he agreed. He then drove to Amelia, and found her and her children neat and clean, and as well dre&s;t as their poor wardrobe would ad|mit. He embraced them with the utmo&s;t affection, and rejoiced Amelia's heart with a favourable account of her hu&s;band. He then told them to pre|pare for a ride with him. The chil|dren were overjoyed at the propo&s;al, and they accompanied him down to the coach in high &s;pirits. Amelia &s;carcely knew what to think or ex|pect. They drove fir&s;t to a warehou&s;e for ready-made linen, where the cap|tain made Amelia furni&s;h her&s;elf with a complete &s;et of every thing nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;ent u&s;e for the children and her&s;elf, not forgetting &s;ome &s;hirts for her hu&s;band. Thence they went to a clothes &s;hop, where the little boy
<PB N="77" REF="80">
was &s;upplied with a jacket and trow|&s;ers, a hat and great coat, and the girl with another great coat and a bon|net&mdash;both were made as happy as happy could be. They were next all furni&s;hed with new &s;hoes. In &s;hort, they had not proceeded far, before the mother and three children were all in complete new habiliments, de|cent but not fine; while the old ones were all tied up in a great bundle, and de&s;tined for &s;ome family &s;till poorer then they had been.</P>
<P>The captain then drove to the lodg|ings he had taken, and which he had directed to be put in thorough order. He led Amelia up &s;tairs, who knew not whither &s;he was going. He brought her into a hand&s;ome parlour, and &s;eated her in a chair. This, my dear, &s;aid he, is your hou&s;e. I hope you will let me now and then come and &s;ee you in it. Amelia turned pale and could not &s;peak. At length
<PB N="78" REF="81">
a flood of tears came to her relief, and the &s;uddenly threw her&s;elf at her un|cle's feet, and poured out thanks and ble&s;&s;ings in a broken voice. He rai&s;ed her, and kindly ki&s;&s;ing her and her children, &s;lipt a pur&s;e of gold into her hand, and hurried down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>He next went to the ho&s;pital, and found Mr. Bland &s;itting up in bed, and taking &s;ome food with apparent plea|&s;ure. He &s;at down by him. <Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s you! Sir, (&s;aid Bland) I &s;ee now it is all a reality, and not a dream. Your figure has been haunting me all night, and I have &s;carcely been able to &s;atisfy my&s;elf whether I had really &s;een and &s;poke to you, or whether it was a fit of delirium. Yet my &s;pirits have been lightened, and I have now been eating with a reli&s;h I have not experienced for many days pa&s;t. But may I a&s;k how is my poor Amelia and my little ones!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"They are well and happy, my good friend, (&s;aid the cap|tain)
<PB N="79" REF="82">
and I hope you will &s;oon be &s;o along with them."</Q> The apothecary came up, and felt his patient's pul&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"You are a lucky doctor, indeed; Sir, (&s;aid he to captain Corni&s;h) you have cured the poor man of his fever. His pul&s;e is as calm as my own."</Q> The captain con&s;ulted him about the &s;afety of removing him; and the apo|thecary thought that there would be no hazard in doing it that very day. The captain waited the arrival of the phy|&s;ician, who confirmed the &s;ame opi|nion. A &s;edan chair was procured, and full directions being obtained for the future treatment, with the phy&s;i|cian's promi&s;e to look after him, the captain walked before the chair, to the new lodgings. On the knock at the door, Amelia looked out of win|dow, and &s;eeing the chair, ran down, and met her uncle and hu&s;band in the pa&s;&s;age. The poor man, not knowing
<PB N="80" REF="83">
where he was, and gazing wildly around him, was carried up &s;tairs and placed upon a good bed, while his wife and children a&s;&s;embled round it. A gla&s;s of wine brought by the people of the hou&s;e re&s;tored him to his re|collection, when a mo&s;t tender &s;cene en&s;ued, which the uncle clo&s;ed as &s;oon as he could, for fear of too much agi|tating the yet feeble organs of the &s;ick man.</P>
<P>By Amelia's con&s;tant attention, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by proper help, Mr. Bland &s;hortly recovered; and the whole fa|mily lo&s;t their &s;ickly emaciated appear|ance, and became healthy and happy. The kind uncle was never long ab&s;ent from them, and was always received with looks of plea&s;ure and gratitude that penetrated his very &s;oul. He obtained for Mr. Bland a good &s;itua|tion in the exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion, and took Amelia and her children into his &s;pecial care. As to his other
<PB N="81" REF="84">
nieces, though he did not entirely break off his connexion with them, but on the contrary, &s;hewed them occa&s;ional marks of the kindne&s;s of a relation, yet he could never look upon them with true cordiality. And as they had &s;o well kept their promi&s;e to their fa|ther of never treating Amelia as a &s;i&s;ter, while in her afflicted &s;tate, he took care not to tempt them to break it, now &s;he was in a favoured and pro&s;perous condition.</P>

<P>IT was a dreadful &s;torm. The wind blowing full on the &s;ea-&s;hore, rolled tremendous waves on the beach, while the half-&s;unk rocks at the entrance of the bay were enveloped in a mi&s;t of white foam. A &s;hip appeared in the offing, driving impetuou&s;ly under her bare poles to land; now tilting aloft on the &s;urging waves, now plunging into the intervening hollows.

<P>The &s;ailors, having got what they could, departed, &s;carcely thanking their benefactor, and marched up the country. Night came on. They de|&s;cried a light at &s;ome di&s;tance, and made up to it. It proceeded from the window of a good-looking hou&s;e, &s;ur|rounded with a farm-yard and garden. They knocked at the door, and in a &s;upplicating tone made known their di&s;tre&s;s, and begged relief. They were admitted, and treated with com|pa&s;&s;ion and ho&s;pitality. In the hou&s;e were the mi&s;tre&s;s, her children and women-&s;ervants, an old man and a boy: the ma&s;ter was abroad. The &s;ailors, &s;itting round the kitchen fire, whi&s;pered to each other that here was an opportunity of making a booty that would amply compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of clothes and wages. They &s;ettled their plan; and on the old man's com|ing
<PB N="97" REF="100">
with logs to the fire, one of them broke his &s;kull with the poker, and laid him dead. Another took up a knife which had been brought with the loaf and chee&s;e, and running after the boy, who was making his e&s;cape out of the hou&s;e, &s;tabbed him to the heart. The re&s;t locked the doors, and after tying all the women and children, be|gan to ran&s;ack the hou&s;e. One of the children continuing to make loud ex|clamations, a fellow went and &s;tran|gled it. They had nearly fini&s;hed pack|ing up &s;uch of the mo&s;t valuable things as they could carry off, when the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e came home. He was a &s;muggler as well as a farmer, and had ju&s;t returned from an expedition, leaving his companions with their goods at a neighbouring public-hou&s;e. Surpri&s;ed at finding the doors locked, and at &s;eeing lights moving about in the chambers, he &s;u&s;pected &s;omewhat ami&s;s; and, upon li&s;tening, he heard
<PB N="98" REF="101">
&s;trange voices, and &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;ailors through the windows. He ha&s;tened back to his companions, and brought them with him ju&s;t as the rob|bers opened the door and were coming out with their pillage, having fir&s;t &s;et fire to the hou&s;e in order to conceal what they had done. The &s;muggler and his friends let fly their blunder-bu&s;&s;es in the mid&s;t of them, and then ru&s;hing forwards, &s;eized the &s;urvivors and &s;ecured them. Perceiving flames in the hou&s;e, they ran and extingui&s;h|ed them. The villains were next day led to pri&s;on amid&s;t the cur&s;es of the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The good Solitary, on hearing of the event, at fir&s;t exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What a wonderful interference of providence to puni&s;h guilt and protect innocence!"</Q> Pau&s;ing a while, he added, <Q REND="inline">"Yet had providence thought fit to have drown|ed the&s;e &s;ailors in their pa&s;&s;age from the &s;hip, where they left &s;o many bet|ter

<Q REND="inline">"That, too,"</Q> replied the venera|ble &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"is a con&s;equence of the &s;ame wi&s;e laws of providence.

The &s;ame force of habit, in a way of life full of peril and hard&s;hip, mu&s;t conduce to form a rough, bold, and unfeeling character.

In the lat|ter ca&s;e, human laws &s;tep in to re|move the evil which they have not been able to prevent. Wickedne&s;s meets with the fate which &s;ooner or later always awaits it; and innocence,

<HEAD>ENVY AND EMULATION.</HEAD>
<P>AT one of the celebrated &s;chools of painting in Italy, a young man named Guidotto produced a piece &s;o excellent, that it was the admiration of the ma&s;ters in the art, who all de|clared
<PB N="107" REF="110">
it to be their opinion that he could not fail of ri&s;ing to the &s;ummit of his profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould he proceed as he had begun.</P>
<P>This performance was looked upon with very different eyes by two of his fellow-&s;cholars. Brunello, the elder of them, who had him&s;elf acquired &s;ome reputation in his &s;tudies, was mortifi|ed in the highe&s;t degree at this &s;upe|riority of Guidotto; and regarding all the honour his rival had acquired as &s;o much taken from him&s;elf, he con|ceived the mo&s;t rancorous di&s;like of him, and longed for nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee him lo&s;e the credit he had gained. Afraid openly to decry the merit of a work which had obtained the approbation of the be&s;t judges, he threw out &s;ecret in&s;inuations that Gui|dotto had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it by one or other of his ma&s;ters; and he affected to repre&s;ent it as a &s;ort of lucky hit,
<PB N="108" REF="111">
which the reputed author would pro|bably never equal.</P>
<P>Not &s;o Lorenzo. Though a very young proficient in the art, he com|prehended in its full extent the excel|lence of Guidotto's performance, and became one of the &s;incere&s;t of his ad|mirers. Fired with the prai&s;es he &s;aw him receive on all &s;ides, he ardently longed one day to de&s;erve the like. He placed him before his eyes as a fair model which it was his highe&s;t ambition to arrive at equalling&mdash;for as to excelling him, he could not as yet conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of it. He never &s;poke of him but with rap|ture, and could not bear to hear the detractions of Brunello.</P>
<P>But Lorenzo did not content him|&s;elf with words. He entered with his whole &s;oul into the career of improve|ment&mdash;was fir&s;t and la&s;t of all the &s;cho|lars in the de&s;igning room&mdash;and de|voted to practice at home tho&s;e hours
<PB N="109" REF="112">
which the other youths pa&s;&s;ed in amu&s;ement. It was long before he could plea&s;e him&s;elf with any of his attempts, and he was continually re|peating over them, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! how far di&s;tant is this from Guidotto's!"</Q> At length, however, he had the &s;atisfac|tion of becoming &s;en&s;ible of progre&s;s; and having received con&s;iderable ap|plau&s;e on account of one of his per|formances, he ventured to &s;ay to him|&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"And why may not I too become a Guidotto?"</Q></P>
<P>Meanwhile, Guidotto continued to bear away the palm from all competi|tors. Brunello &s;truggled a while to conte&s;t with him, but at length gave up the point, and con&s;oled him&s;elf under his inferiority by ill-natured &s;ar|ca&s;m and petulant critici&s;m. Lo|renzo worked away in &s;ilence, and it was long before his mode&s;ty would &s;uffer him to place any piece of his in
<PB N="110" REF="113">
view at the &s;ame time with one of Guidotto's.</P>
<P>There was a certain day in the year in which it was cu&s;tomary for all the &s;cholars to exhibit their be&s;t perform|ance in a public hall, where their me|rit was &s;olemnly judged by a number of &s;elect examiners, and a prize of va|lue was awarded to the mo&s;t excellent. Guidotto had prepared for this anni|ver&s;ary with a piece which was to ex|cel all he had before executed. He had ju&s;t fini&s;hed it on the evening be|fore the exhibition, and nothing re|mained but to heighten the colouring by means of a tran&s;parent varni&s;h. The malignant Brunello contrived art|fully to convey into the phial contain|ing this varni&s;h, &s;ome drops of a cau&s;tic preparation, the effect of which would be entirely to de&s;troy the beauty and &s;plendour of the piece. Guidotto laid it on by candle-light, and then with great &s;atisfaction hung up his picture
<PB N="111" REF="114">
in the public room again&s;t the mor|row.</P>
<P>Lorenzo, too, with beating heart, had prepared him&s;elf for the day. With va&s;t application he had fini&s;hed a piece which he humbly hoped might appear not greatly inferior to &s;ome of Guidotto's earlier performances.</P>
<P>The important day was now arriv|ed. The company a&s;&s;embled, and were introduced into the great room, where the light had ju&s;t been fully ad|mitted by drawing up a curtain. All went up with rai&s;ed expectations to Guidotto's picture, when, behold! in|&s;tead of the brilliant beauty they had conceived, there was nothing but a dead &s;urface of confu&s;ed and blotched colours. <Q REND="inline">"Surely (they cried) this cannot be Guidotto's!"</Q> The unfor|tunate youth him&s;elf came up, and on beholding the di&s;mal change of his favourite piece, bur&s;t out into an ago|ny of grief, and exclaimed that he was
<PB N="112" REF="115">
betrayed and undone. The vile Bru|nello in a corner was enjoying his di&s;|tre&s;s. But Lorenzo was little le&s;s af|fected than Guidotto him&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"Trick! knavery! (he cried.) Indeed, gen|tlemen, this is not Guidotto's work. I &s;aw it when only half fini&s;hed, and it was a mo&s;t charming performance. Look at the outline, and judge what it mu&s;t have been before it was &s;o ba&s;e|ly injured."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;pectators were all &s;truck with Lorenzo's generous warmth, and &s;ym|pathi&s;ed in the di&s;grace of Guidotto; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to adjudge the prize to his picture in the &s;tate in which they beheld it. They examin|ed all the others attentively, and that of Lorenzo, till then an unknown ar|ti&s;t to them, gained a great majority of &s;uffrages. The prize was therefore awarded to him; but Lorenzo, on re|ceiving it, went up to Guidotto, and pre&s;enting it to him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Take
<PB N="113" REF="116">
what merit would undoubtedly have acquired for you, had not the ba&s;e&s;t malice and envy defrauded you of it. To me it is honour enough to be ac|counted your &s;econd. If hereafter I may a&s;pire to equal you, it &s;hall be by means of fair competition, not by the aid of treachery."</Q></P>
<P>Lorenzo's noblene&s;s of conduct ex|cited the warme&s;t encomiums among the judges, who at length determined, that for this time there &s;hould be two equal prizes di&s;tributed; for that if Guidotto had de&s;erved the prize of painting, Lorenzo was entitled to that of virtue.</P>

<HEAD>THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>A DEBATE once aro&s;e among the animals in a farm-yard, which of them was mo&s;t valued by their common ma&s;ter. After the hor&s;e, the ox, the
<PB N="114" REF="117">
cow, the &s;heep, and the dog, had &s;tated their &s;everal preten&s;ions, the hog took up the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is plain (&s;aid he) that the greate&s;t value mu&s;t be &s;et upon that animal which is kept mo&s;t for his own &s;ake, without expecting from him any return of u&s;e and &s;ervice. Now which of you can boa&s;t &s;o much in that re|&s;pect as I can?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As for you, Hor&s;e, though you are very well fed and lodged, and have &s;ervants to attend upon you and make you &s;leek and clean, yet all this is for the &s;ake of your labour. Do not I &s;ee you taken out early every morn|ing, put in chains, or fa&s;tened to the &s;hafts of a heavy cart, and not brought back till noon; when, after a &s;hort re&s;pite, you are taken to work again till late in the evening? I may &s;ay ju&s;t the &s;ame to the Ox, except that he works for poorer fare.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For you, Mrs. Cow, who are &s;o
<PB N="115" REF="118">
dainty over your chopped &s;traw and grains, you are thought worth keep|ing only for your milk, which is drain|ed from you twice a day to the la&s;t drop, while your poor young ones are taken from you, and &s;ent I know not whither.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You, poor innocent Sheep, who are turned out to &s;hift for your&s;elves upon the bare hills, or penned upon the fallows with now and then a wi|thered turnep or &s;ome mu&s;ty hay, you pay dearly enough for your keep by re&s;igning your warm coat every year, for want of which you are liable to be &s;tarved to death on &s;ome of the cold nights before &s;ummer.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As for the Dog, who prides him|&s;elf &s;o much on being admitted to our ma&s;ter's table, and made his compa|nion, that he will &s;carce conde&s;cend to reckon him&s;elf one of us, he is oblig|ed to do all the offices of a dome&s;tic &s;ervant by day, and to keep watch

<P><Q REND="inline">"In &s;hort, you are all of you crea|tures maintained for u&s;e&mdash;poor &s;ub-&s;ervient things, made to be en&s;laved or pillaged.

<P>Thus argued the Hog, and put the re&s;t to &s;ilence by &s;o much logic and rhetoric. This was not long before winter &s;et in. It proved a very &s;carce &s;ea&s;on for fodder of all kinds; &s;o that the farmer began to con&s;ider how he was to maintain all his live &s;tock till &s;pring. <Q REND="inline">"It will be impo&s;&s;ible for me (thought he) to keep them all; I mu&s;t therefore part with tho&s;e I can be&s;t &s;pare.

<PB N="117" REF="120">
enough to employ them; they mu&s;t be kept, co&s;t what it will. My cows will not give me much milk in the winter, but they will calve in the &s;pring, and be ready for the new gra&s;s. I mu&s;t not lo&s;e the profit of my dairy. The &s;heep, poor things, will take care of them&s;elves as long as there is a bite upon the hills: and if deep &s;now comes, we mu&s;t do with them as well as we can by the help of a few turneps and &s;ome hay, for I mu&s;t have their wool at &s;hear|ing time to make out my rent with. But my hogs will eat me out of hou&s;e and home, without doing me any good. They mu&s;t go to pot, that's certain; and the &s;ooner I get rid of the &s;at ones, the better."</Q></P>

<P>At length an aged magi&s;trate from a di&s;tant province made his appear|ance. He was &s;imply clad in a long cotton robe, and his hoary beard waved on his brea&s;t. He made his obei&s;ance before the young monarch, and holding forth an embroidered &s;ilken bag, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him.</P>

<P>I mean &s;ome day to take you to the lecture of an ingenious philo&s;opher who has contrived a machine that will give you a better notion of the&s;e things in an hour, than I could by mere talking in a week. But it is now my intention to make you better acquainted with this globe
<PB N="124" REF="127">
which we inhabit, and which, indeed, is the mo&s;t important to us. Ca&s;t your eyes upon this little ball. You &s;ee it is a repre&s;entation of the earth, being covered with a painted map of the world. This map is cro&s;&s;ed with lines in various directions; but all you have to ob&s;erve relative to what I am going to talk about, is the great line acro&s;s the middle, called the <HI>equator,</HI> or <HI>equinoctial line,</HI> and the two points at top and bottom, called the <HI>poles,</HI> of which the uppermo&s;t is the northern, the lowermo&s;t the &s;outhern.</P>

<P>Now, the &s;un, which illuminates all the parts of this globe by turns as they roll round before it, &s;hines di|rectly upon the equator, but darts its rays a&s;lant towards the poles; and this is the cau&s;e of the great heat per|ceived in the middle regions of the earth, and of its gradual diminution as you proceed from them on either
<PB N="125" REF="128">
&s;ide towards the extremities. To u&s;e a vulgar illu&s;tration, it is like a piece of meat roa&s;ting before a fire, the mid|dle part of which is liable to be over|done, while the two ends are raw.</P>

<P>From this &s;imple circum&s;tance &s;ome of the greate&s;t differences on the &s;urface of the earth, with re&s;pect to man, other animals, and vegetables, proceed; for heat is the great princi|ple of life and vegetation; and where it mo&s;t prevails, provided it be ac|companied with due moi&s;ture, nature is mo&s;t repleni&s;hed with all &s;orts of liv|ing and growing things. In general, then, the countries lying on each &s;ide about the equator, and forming a broad belt round the globe, called the <HI>tropics</HI> or <HI>torrid zone,</HI> are rich and ex|uberant in their products to a degree much &s;uperior to what we &s;ee in our climates.

<PB N="126" REF="129">
verdure, and loaded with flow|ers of the gaye&s;t colours and &s;weete&s;t fragrance, &s;ucceeded by fruits of high flavour or abundant nutriment. The in&s;ect tribe is multiplied &s;o as to fill all the air, and many of them a&s;toni&s;h by their &s;ize and extraordinary forms, and the &s;plendour of their hues.

<P>But the elements, too, are there upon a grand and terrific &s;cale. The &s;ky either blazes with intolerable beams, or pours down rain in irre&s;i&s;t|ible torrents. The winds &s;well to furious hurricanes, which often de&s;o|late
<PB N="128" REF="131">
the whole face of nature in a day. Earthquakes rock the ground, and &s;ometimes open it in cha&s;ms, which &s;wallow up entire cities. Storms rai&s;e the waves of the ocean into mountains, and drive them in a deluge to the land.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that would &s;poil my &s;hell-gathering. The&s;e countries may be very fine, but I don't like them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then&mdash;we will turn from them to the <HI>temperate</HI> regions. You will ob&s;erve, on looking at the map, that the&s;e chiefly lie on the northern &s;ide of the tropics; for on the &s;outhern &s;ide, the &s;pace is almo&s;t wholly occu|pied by &s;ea. Though geographers have drawn a boundary line between the torrid and temperate zones, yet nature has made none; and for a con|&s;iderable &s;pace on the borders, the di|minution of heat is &s;o gradual as to produce little difference in the appear|ance of nature. But, in general, the
<PB N="129" REF="132">
temperate <HI>zones</HI> or <HI>belts</HI> form the mo&s;t de&s;irable di&s;tricts on the face of the earth. Their products are extremely various, and abound in beauty and utility. Corn, wine, and oil, are among their vegetable &s;tores: the hor&s;e, the ox, and the &s;heep, graze their verdant pa&s;tures. Their &s;ea&s;ons have the plea&s;|ing vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;ummer and winter, &s;pring and autumn. Though in &s;ome parts they are &s;ubject to exce&s;s of heat, and in others of cold, yet they de&s;erve the general prai&s;e of a mild tempera|ture, compared to the re&s;t of the globe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are the countries for me, then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>You <HI>do</HI> live in one of them, though our i&s;land is &s;ituated &s;o far to the north, that it ranks rather among the cold countries than the warm ones. However, we have the good fortune to be a long way removed from tho&s;e dreary and comfortle&s;s
<PB N="130" REF="133">
tracts of the globe which lie about the poles, and are called the <HI>frigid zones.</HI> In the&s;e, the cheering influence of the &s;un gradually becomes extinct, and perpetual fro&s;t and &s;now take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the earth. Trees and plants dimini&s;h in number and &s;ize, till at length no vegetables are found but &s;ome mo&s;&s;es and a few &s;tunted herbs. Land animals are reduced to three or four &s;pecies; rein-deer, white-bears, arctic foxes, and &s;now-birds. The &s;ea, however, as far as it remains free from ice, is all alive with the finny tribe. Enormous whales &s;pout and gambol among the floating ice-i&s;lands, and herds of &s;eals pur&s;ue the &s;hoals of &s;maller fi&s;h, and harbour in the ca|verns of the rocky coa&s;ts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e creatures have not much to do with the &s;un.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nature has given them powers of enduring cold beyond tho&s;e of many other animals; and then the water
<PB N="131" REF="134">
is always warmer than the land in cold climates; nay, at a certain depth, it is equally warm in all parts of the globe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but as I cannot go to the bottom of the &s;ea, I de&s;ire to have no|thing to do with the&s;e di&s;mal coun|tries. But do any men live there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is one of the wonderful things belonging to man that he is capable of living in all parts of the globe where any other animals live. And as no|thing relative to this earth is &s;o im|portant to us as the condition of hu|man creatures in it, &s;uppo&s;e we take a general &s;urvey of the different races of men who inhabit all the tracts we have been &s;peaking of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blacks, and whites, and all colours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely. If a black dog is as much a dog as a white one, why &s;hould not a black man be as much a man? I know nothing that colour
<PB N="132" REF="135">
has to do with mind. Well then&mdash;to go back to the equator. The middle or tropical girdle of the earth, which by the antients was concluded to be unihabitable from its extreme heat, has been found by modern di&s;cove|ries to be as well filled with men as it is with other living creatures. And no wonder; for life is maintained here at le&s;s co&s;t than el&s;ewhere. Clothes and fuel are &s;carcely at all nece&s;&s;ary. A &s;hed of bamboo covered with palm leaves &s;erves for a hou&s;e; and food is almo&s;t the &s;pontaneous product of na|ture. The bread-fruit, the cocoa, the ba|nana, and the plantain, offer their &s;tores freely to the gatherer; and if he takes the additional pains to plant a few yams, or &s;ow a little Indian corn, he is furni&s;hed with never failing plenty. Hence the inhabitants of many tropi|cal countries live nearly in what is call|ed a &s;tate of nature, without care or labour, u&s;ing the gifts of providence
<PB N="133" REF="136">
like the animals around them. The naked Indian, &s;tretched at ea&s;e under the &s;hade of a lofty tree, pa&s;&s;es his hours in indolent repo&s;e, unle&s;s rouz|ed to temporary exertion by the pa&s;|&s;ion of the chace, or the love of danc|ing and other &s;ocial &s;ports.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;that would be a charm|ing life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>So the poet Thom&s;on &s;eemed to think, when he bur&s;t out into a rap|turous de&s;cription of the beauties and plea&s;ures afforded by the&s;e favoured regions. Perhaps you can remember &s;ome of his lines.</P>

<L>O &s;tretch'd amid the&s;e orchards of the &s;un,</L>

<P>Delightful! Think, however,
<PB N="134" REF="137">
at what price they purcha&s;e this indo|dolent enjoyment of life. In the fir&s;t place, all the work that is done is thrown upon the women, who are al|ways mo&s;t tyrannized over, the nearer a people approach to a &s;tate of na|ture.</P>

<P>Oh horrible! I am glad I do not live there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, the mind not having that &s;pur to exertion which nece&s;&s;ity alone can give, moulders in inaction, and becomes incapable of tho&s;e advances in knowledge and vigour which rai&s;e and dignify the human character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is the &s;ame with lazy people every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. The exce&s;&s;ive heat, how|ever, of the&s;e countries &s;eems of it&s;elf to relax the mind, and unfit it for its noble&s;t exertions. And I que&s;tion if a &s;ingle in&s;tance could be produced of an original inhabitant of the tropics, who has attained to eminence in the
<PB N="135" REF="138">
higher walks of &s;cience. It is their general character to be gay, volatile, and thoughtle&s;s, &s;ubject to violent pa&s;&s;ions, but commonly mild and gentle, fond of &s;ociety and amu&s;e|ments, ingenious in little arts, but incapable of great or long-continued efforts. They form a large portion of the human race, and probably not the lea&s;t happy. You &s;ee what va&s;t tracts of land lie within this divi&s;ion; mo&s;t of Africa and South America; all the great i&s;lands of A&s;ia, and two of its large penin&s;ulas. Of the&s;e, the A&s;iatic part is the mo&s;t populous and civilized; indeed, many of its nations are as far removed from a &s;tate of na|ture as we are, and their con&s;titutional indolence has been completely over|come by nece&s;&s;ity. The clothing of tho&s;e who are in a civilized &s;tate is mo&s;tly made of cotton, which is a na|tural product of the&s;e climates. Their food is chiefly of the vegetable kind;
<PB N="136" REF="139">
and be&s;ides the articles already men|tioned, con&s;i&s;ts much of rice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are the people all black?</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; entirely or nearly &s;o.</P>

<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that is owing to the heat of the &s;un.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly; for we find all the &s;hades from jet black to tawny, and at length white, as we proceed from the equator towards the poles. The African negroes, however, from their curled wooly hair, and their flat features, have been &s;uppo&s;ed an ori|ginally di&s;tinct race of mankind. The Ea&s;t Indian blacks, though under an equally hot climate, have long flowing hair, and features not different from their fairer neighbours. Almo&s;t all of the&s;e nations are &s;ubject to de&s;potic governments. In religion they are mo&s;tly pagans, with a mixture of ma|hometans.</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then&mdash;look again on the globe to the northern fide of the tropics, and &s;ee what a tour we &s;hall take you among the inhabitants of the north temperate zone. Here are all the mo&s;t famous places on the earth; rich populous countries, renowned at different periods for arts and arms. Here is the greate&s;t part of A&s;ia, a little of Africa, all Europe, and North America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, however, there mu&s;t be great differences both in the cli|mate and the way of life, in &s;o many countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Extremely great. The &s;outhern parts partake a good deal of the cha|racter of the tropical regions. The heat is &s;till exce&s;&s;ive, and renders ex|ertions painful; whence the people have in general been reckoned &s;oft, effeminate, and voluptuous. Let us, however, look at them a little clo&s;er. Here is the mighty empire of China,
<PB N="138" REF="141">
&s;warming with people to &s;uch a de|gree, that notwith&s;tanding its &s;ize and fertility, the inhabitants are obliged to exert the greate&s;t indu&s;try to procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Nearly in a line with it are the Mogul's empire, the kingdom of Per&s;ia, and the Turki&s;h dominions in A&s;ia; all warm climates, a bounding in products of u&s;e and beauty, and inhabited by numerous and civilized people. Here &s;tretches out the great penin&s;ula of Arabia, for the mo&s;t part a dry and de&s;art land, over&s;pread with burning &s;ands, only to be cro&s;&s;ed by the patient camel. Wild and ferocious tribes of men wander over it, chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by their herds and flocks, and by the trade of robbery, which they exerci&s;e on all travellers that fall in their way. A tract &s;omewhat &s;imilar, though in a colder climate, is the va&s;t country of Tartary, &s;tretching like a belt from ea&s;t to we&s;t acro&s;s the middle of
<PB N="139" REF="142">
A&s;ia; over the immen&s;e plains and de&s;arts of which, a number of inde|pendent tribes continually roam, fixing their moveable habitations in one part or another, according as they afford pa&s;turage to their herds of cattle and hor&s;es. The&s;e men have for many ages lived in the &s;ame &s;imple &s;tate, un|acquainted as well with the arts, as the vices, of civilized nations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I think it mu&s;t be a very plea&s;ant life to ramble about from place to place, and change one's abode according to the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Tartars think &s;o; for the wor&s;t wi&s;h they can find for a man, is that he may live in a hou&s;e and work like a Ru&s;&s;ian. Now look at Europe. See what a &s;mall figure it makes on the &s;urface of the globe as to &s;ize; and yet it has for many ages held the fir&s;t place in knowledge, activity, ci|vilization, and all the qualities that elevate man among his fellows. For
<PB N="140" REF="143">
this it is much indebted to that tem|perature of climate which calls forth all the faculties of man in order to render life comfortable, yet affords enough of the beauties of nature to warm the heart and exalt the imagi|nation. Men here earn their bread with the &s;weat of their brow. Na|ture does not drop her fruits into their mouths, but offers them as the price of labour. Human wants are many. Clothes, food, lodging, are all ob|jects of much care and contrivance, but the human powers fully exerted are equal to the demand; and no|where are enjoyments &s;o various and multiplied. What the land does not yield it&s;elf, its inhabitants by their active indu&s;try procure from the re|mote&s;t parts of the globe. When we drink tea, we &s;weeten the infu&s;ion of a Chine&s;e herb with the juice of a We&s;t Indian cane; and your common dre&s;s is compo&s;ed of materials collected from
<PB N="141" REF="144">
the equator to the frigid zone. Eu|ropeans render all countries and cli|mates familiar to them; and every where they a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority over the le&s;s enlightened or le&s;s indu&s;trious natives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Europe for me, after all. But is not America as good?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>That part of North America which has been &s;ettled by Europeans, is only another Europe in manners and civilization. But the original in|habitants of that exten&s;ive country were bold and hardy barbarians, and many of them continue &s;o to this day. So much for the temperate zone, which contains the prime of mankind. They differ extremely, however, in govern|ments, laws, cu&s;toms, and religions. The chri&s;tian religion has the credit of reckoning among its votaries all the civilized people of Europe and America. The mahometan po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the nearer parts of A&s;ia and the
<PB N="142" REF="145">
north of Africa; but China, Japan, and mo&s;t of the circumjacent coun|tries, profe&s;s different forms of pagan|i&s;m. The ea&s;t, in general, is en|flaved to de&s;poti&s;m; but the nobler we&s;t enjoys in mo&s;t of its &s;tates more or le&s;s of freedom.</P>
<P>As to the frigid zone, its few in|habitants can but ju&s;t &s;u&s;tain a life little better than that of the brutes. Their faculties are benumbed by the climate. Their chief employment is the fi&s;hery or the chace, by which they procure their food. The tend|ing of herds of rein-deer in &s;ome parts varies their occupations and diet. They pa&s;s their long win|ters in holes dug under ground, where they doze out mo&s;t of their time in &s;tupid repo&s;e.</P>

<P>Perhaps the warmer countries are plea&s;anter; but there are few ad|vantages which are not balanced by &s;ome inconveniences; and it is the true&s;t wi&s;dom to be contented with out lot, and endeavour to make the be&s;t of it. One great le&s;&s;on, how|ever, I wi&s;h you to derive from this <HI>globe-lecture.</HI> You &s;ee that no part of
<PB N="144" REF="147">
the world is void of our human bre|thren, who, amid&s;t all the diver&s;ities of character and condition, are yet all <HI>men,</HI> filling the &s;tation in which their Creator has placed them. We are too apt to look at the differences of mankind, and to undervalue all tho&s;e who do not agree with us in matters that we think of high importance. But who are we&mdash;and what cau&s;e have we to think our&s;elves right, and all others wrong? Can we imagine that hundreds of millions of our &s;pecies in other parts of the world are left de&s;titute of what is e&s;&s;ential to their well-being, while a favoured few like our&s;elves are the only ones who po&s;|&s;e&s;s it? Having all a common na|ture, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily agree in more things than we differ. The road to virtue and happine&s;s is alike open to all. The mode of pur&s;uit is various; the end is the &s;ame.</P>

<HEAD>THE GAIN OF A LOSS.</HEAD>
<P>PHILANDER po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;ider|able place about the court, which obliged him to live in a &s;tyle of &s;how and expence. He kept high compa|ny, made frequent entertainments, and brought up a family of &s;everal daugh|ters in all the luxurious elegance which his &s;ituation and pro&s;pects &s;eemed to ju&s;tify. His wife had balls and routs at ther own hou&s;e, and frequented all the places of fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement. After &s;ome years pa&s;&s;ed in this man|ner, a &s;udden change of parties threw Philander out of his employment, and at once ruined all his plans of future advancement. Though his place had been lucrative, the expence it led him into more than compen&s;ated the profits, &s;o that in&s;tead of &s;aving any thing, he had involved him&s;elf con|&s;iderably in debt. His creditors, on
<PB N="146" REF="149">
hearing of the change in his affairs, be|came &s;o importunate, that in order to &s;atisfy them, he was compelled to &s;ell a moderate paternal e&s;tate in a remote county, re&s;erving nothing out of it but one &s;mall farm. Philander had &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to enable him at once to decide on the be&s;t plan to be followed in his pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances; in&s;tead, therefore, of wa&s;ting his time and remaining pro|perty in fruitle&s;s attempts to intere&s;t his town friends in his favour, he &s;old off his fine furniture, and without de|lay carried down his whole family to the little &s;pot he could &s;till call his own, where he commenced a life of indu&s;try and &s;trict frugality in the ca|pacity of a &s;mall farmer. It was long before the female part of his hou&s;e|hold could accommodate them&s;elves to a mode of living &s;o new to them, and &s;o de&s;titute of all that they had been accu&s;tomed to regard as e&s;&s;ential to
<PB N="147" REF="150">
their very exi&s;tence. At length, how|ever, mutual affection and natural good &s;en&s;e, and above all, nece&s;&s;ity, brought them to acquie&s;ce tolerably in their &s;ituation, and to engage in earne&s;t in its duties. Occa&s;ional regrets, how|ever, could not but remain; and the &s;ilent &s;igh would tell whither their thoughts were fled.</P>
<P>Philander perceived it, but took care never to embitter their feelings by har&s;h chidings or untimely admo|nitions. But on the fir&s;t anniver&s;ary of their taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the farm|hou&s;e, he a&s;&s;embled them under a &s;preading tree that grew before their little garden, and while the &s;ummer's &s;un gilded all the objects around, he thus addre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear partners in every fortune, if the revolution of a year has had the effect on your mind that it has on mine, I may congratulate you on our condition. I am now able with a firm
<PB N="148" REF="151">
tone to a&s;k my&s;elf, What have I lo&s;t? and I feel &s;o much more to be plea&s;ed with than to regret, that the que&s;tion gives me rather comfort than &s;orrow. Look at you &s;plendid luminary, and tell me if its gradual appearance above the horizon on a fine morning, &s;hed|ding light and joy over the wide crea|tion, be not a grander as well as a more heart-chearing &s;pectacle than that of the mo&s;t magnificent &s;aloon, illumi|nated with dazzling lu&s;tres. Is not the &s;pirit of the whole&s;ome breeze, fre&s;h from the mountain, and perfum|ed with wild flowers, infinitely more invigorating to the &s;en&s;es than the air of the crowded drawing-room, loaded with &s;cented powder and e&s;&s;ences? Did we reli&s;h &s;o well the di&s;gui&s;ed di&s;hes with which a French cook &s;trove to when our &s;ickly appetites, as we do our draught of new milk, our home|made loaf, and the other articles of our &s;imple fare? Was our &s;leep &s;o
<PB N="149" REF="152">
&s;weet after midnight &s;uppers and the long vigils of cards, as it is now, that early ri&s;ing and the exerci&s;es of the day prepare us for clo&s;ing our eyes as &s;oon as night has covered every thing with her friendly veil? Shall we com|plain that our clothes at pre&s;ent only an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of keeping us warm, when we recollect all the care and pains it co&s;t us to keep pace with the fa&s;hion, and the mortification we underwent at being out&s;hone by our &s;uperiors in fortune. Did not the vexation of in&s;olent and unfaithful &s;ervants over-balance the trouble we now find in waiting on our&s;elves? We may regret the lo&s;s of &s;ociety; but, alas! what was the &s;ociety of a crowd of vi&s;itors who regarded us merely as the keepers of a place of public re|&s;ort, and whom we vi&s;ited with &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations? If we formerly could command lei&s;ure to cultivate our minds, and acquire polite accompli&s;h|ments;
<PB N="150" REF="153">
did we, in reality, apply much lei&s;ure to the&s;e purpo&s;es, and is not our time now filled more to our &s;ati&s;|faction by employments of which we cannot doubt the u&s;efulne&s;s?&mdash;not to &s;ay, that the moral virtues we are now called upon to exerci&s;e, afford the tru|e&s;t cultivation to our minds. What, then, have we lo&s;t? In improved health, the charms of a beautiful coun|try, a decent &s;upply of all real wants, and the love and kind offices of each other, do not we &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s enough for worldly happine&s;s? We have lo&s;t, indeed, a certain rank and &s;tation in life; but have we not ac|quired another as truly re&s;pectable? We are debarred the pro&s;pects of fu|ture advancement; but if our pre|&s;ent condition is a good one, why need we lament that it is likely to be la&s;t|ing? The next anniver&s;ary will find us more in harmony with our &s;ituation than even the pre&s;ent. Look for|ward,
<PB N="151" REF="154">
then, cheerily. The &s;torm is pa&s;t. We have been &s;hipwrecked, but we have only exchanged a cumbrous ve&s;&s;el for a light pinnace, and we are again on our cour&s;e. Much of our cargo has been thrown overboard, but no one lo&s;es what he does not mi&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, Philander tenderly embraced his wife and daughters. The tear &s;tood in their eyes, but con&s;ola|tion beamed on their hearts.</P>
