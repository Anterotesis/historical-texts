<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>AS Sir George Warrington was following the chace with his u&s;ual avidity, one fine morning in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-two; his hor&s;e, in attempting to leap a five-barred gate, threw him to the ground with &s;uch force that he remained for &s;ome time in&s;en&s;ible. Always the fir&s;t in the pur&s;uit, it was &s;everal minutes before he was over|taken by his companions, who, when they lifted him up, immediately per|ceived his leg was broken. One of
<PB N="2" REF="3">
his attendants then &s;et off full &s;peed for the village, and immediately re|turned with a &s;ort of litter, on which he was borne to Warrington Ca&s;tle; and as a &s;urgeon from the next town had been &s;ent for at the &s;ame time, he arrived almo&s;t as &s;oon as the Ba|ronet; and having &s;et his leg, and de|clared the fracture by no means a dangerous one, he took leave, de&s;ir|ing his patient might be kept as quiet as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The character of our hero might more properly be termed a mixture of good qualities and foibles, than of virtues and vices: as he had more of the latter in his compo&s;ition; and the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
former, from the peculiarities of his education, though numerous, were inactive. To account for this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, before I enter on the events of his own life, to mention &s;ome particulars of his father.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Warrington was a mere country &s;quire, without abilities and without improvement. Rough and unpoli&s;hed in his manners, and violent in his di&s;po&s;ition, he had yet the good fortune to gain the hand and approbation, if not the heart, of Mi&s;s Hamilton, a young woman of high birth, who was elegant, accom|pli&s;hed, and beautiful. Perhaps Sir Thomas would not have been the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
man of her choice, had her &s;ituation been either an independent or a happy one; but the tyranny of a mother-in-law, and the certainty of compara|tive poverty on the death of her fa|ther, who&s;e vices and extravagance had equally impaired his fortune and his con&s;titution, induced her to com|ply with the Baronet's propo&s;als, who, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, appeared to her in a very different light at that time; as his per&s;on was hand&s;ome, and his addre&s;s, though far from elegant, had in it more of ru&s;ticity than vulgarity; and the cheerfulne&s;s of his conver|&s;ation concealed in &s;ome mea&s;ure the inferiority of his under&s;tanding. Af|ter a &s;hort court&s;hip, Sir Thomas
<PB N="5" REF="6">
carried his bride to Warrington Ca&s;|tle, where &s;he had &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to di&s;cover the faults of her lord and ma&s;ter&mdash;for &s;uch in every in&s;tance he proved him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord Milbanke, extremely happy in the opportunity of parting with his daughter to &s;uch advantage (for Sir Thomas Warrington po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable e&s;tate), promi&s;ed to give her five thou&s;and pounds&mdash;when he well knew he could not command &s;o many hundreds; and his failure in this promi&s;e &s;o completely di&s;gu&s;ted the Baronet, who him&s;elf wanted nei|ther genero&s;ity nor &s;incerity, that he forbade Lady Warrington's keeping
<PB N="6" REF="7">
up any connection with her own fami|ly; and as &s;he was too timid to re&s;i&s;t the commands of an ab&s;olute hu&s;|band, and her father had not a &s;uffi|cient degree of affection for her to reque&s;t her breaking through the re|&s;trictions impo&s;ed, they met but once after her marriage; and the Vi&s;count dying in a few months, all intercour&s;e between them cea&s;ed. Her only bro|ther was at that time abroad; and on his return, being prejudiced by the Dowager Lady Milbanke both again&s;t her and the Baronet, made no enqui|ries for them.</P>
<P>The duplicity of the Vi&s;count, who had a place under Government, in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="8">
the natural di&s;like Sir Thomas had to courtiers, as he called them; and with an inveteracy by no means ju&s;tifiable, he often declared his utter di&s;like to all who bore the name. In all elections he voted only for tho&s;e who &s;upported the country intere&s;t; and in fact quarrelled with all the neighbouring gentlemen who were on the other &s;ide. Thus Lady Warring|ton was not only de&s;erted by her own relations, but excluded from almo&s;t all other &s;ociety; as the general vio|lence of her hu&s;band's di&s;po&s;ition prevented even the families who&s;e political opinions coincided with his own from forming any intimacy with him; and a few annual vi&s;its were all
<PB N="8" REF="9">
that pa&s;&s;ed: and the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who were termed the gentry of Bellingham, the neighbouring town, was &s;o little &s;uited to Lady Warring|ton's ta&s;te, and &s;o totally different from what &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to in the earlier part of her life, that &s;he avoided it as much as po&s;&s;ible, without appearing either haughty or ill-humoured. Her time therefore was chiefly devoted to the education of George, our pre&s;ent hero, the only child &s;he ever had; and &s;he impre&s;&s;ed on his tender mind tho&s;e &s;entiments of genero&s;ity, humanity, and religion, which he never lo&s;t, though the ad|vice and example of his father for &s;ome years prevented their effects.
<PB N="9" REF="10">
He was &s;carcely twelve when this exemplary mother was taken from him; and he felt her lo&s;s as &s;everely as &s;uch a child could feel. Sir Tho|mas, who, in his way, really loved her, lamented her at fir&s;t with that violence &s;o natural to him, and which always exhau&s;ts it&s;elf: of cour&s;e, when the fir&s;t emotions of grief were &s;ub|&s;ided, he not merely grew calm, but &s;uffered him&s;elf to be con&s;oled by the reflection, that, had &s;he lived, Lady Warrington would have made a milk&s;op of his boy. And in con&s;e|quence of his idea of the proper mode of education, he initiated him at once into all the &s;ports of the field.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">Thus, at an age when other boys are &s;tudying Greek and Latin, he was following the hounds; and that ardour and warmth of di&s;po&s;ition which, added to a naturally &s;trong genius, would, if turned into a proper channel, have rendered him the de|light and ornament of &s;ociety, now &s;erved only to lead him the fore|mo&s;t in the chace; and that extreme &s;weetne&s;s of temper which he inhe|rited from his mother, only made him the little patron of all the village amu&s;ements, which in a le&s;s limited &s;cene would have di&s;po&s;ed him to be the general friend and benefactor of mankind. His mind however was not wholly uncultivated. Mr. Thom|&s;on
<PB N="11" REF="12">
the vicar had a hand&s;ome &s;alary for devoting a few hours every day to his education: and as he learned very quickly, his ta&s;ks were &s;oon per|formed; but they left no impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, though his memory was naturally &s;o good, it could have given him very little trouble to recollect all he had been taught. But a new hor&s;e or a new dog engro&s;&s;ed his whole attention &s;o much, that they never failed to drive Horace and Ju|venal, Livy and Tacitus, out of his head: in fact, in every conte&s;t of this kind, the modern Pompey or Cae&s;ar fairly conquered all the heroes of an|tiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">I have now given my readers &s;ome account of Sir George in his earlie&s;t days; let me next de&s;cribe him at the period where this hi&s;tory begins. He was ju&s;t twenty-one, and, having lo&s;t his father about eight months, was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an unincumbered e&s;tate of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year. His countenance was open, animated, and intere&s;ting: his eyes expre&s;&s;ive of more good &s;en&s;e than his tongue had ever yet uttered: his complexion would have been too fair, but that the glow of health, added to the effects of the &s;un, to which he was con&s;tantly expo&s;ed, gave it a darker &s;hade; and his features, though not exactly re|gular, were &s;uch as no one could
<PB N="13" REF="14">
ob&s;erve without pronouncing him a hand&s;ome young man. His air had &s;omething in it of natural grace, as his addre&s;s had of natural courte&s;y, which it was ea&s;ily perceived a few months intercour&s;e with the great world would convert into elegance, as, though ru&s;tic, he was by no means vulgar; for that politene&s;s which &s;prings from an innate wi&s;h of plea&s;|ing, and that dignity which is ever the re&s;ult of con&s;cious worth and na|tive integrity, require but little arti|ficial poli&s;h to render their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors not merely e&s;teemed but admired.</P>
<P>His father's un&s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition to all but his brother &s;port&s;men had con|fined
<PB N="14" REF="15">
our hero's acquaintance in the &s;ame degree; but, when his own ma&s;|ter, he extended it to a few families in Bellingham, where he al&s;o attended the monthly a&s;&s;embly. An acquired rather than an habitual &s;hyne&s;s pre|vented him from &s;eeking the &s;ociety of tho&s;e gentlemen, who were in fact only his equals; but he knew not how to begin, and they were deterred from making an acquaintance with him, by &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;et out in life on his father's plan. At the Bel|lingham balls, he danced mo&s;t fre|quently with Mi&s;s Kettering (the daughter of the &s;urgeon who, as mentioned before, was &s;ent for to &s;et his leg), as the prettie&s;t girl in the
<PB N="15" REF="16">
place; of whom it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;hort de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Nancy, as &s;he was called by her mamma, or, as &s;he called her&s;elf, Mi&s;s Anna Maria Kettering, had been educated at a provincial boarding|&s;chool, where &s;he was taught to dance a little, play a little, work a little, write a little, but to dre&s;s a great deal; and the latter accompli&s;hment was what &s;he mo&s;t &s;trictly attended to, as it had made the deepe&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion on her mind. She was not very wi&s;e, but &s;he had a very high opinion of her&s;elf, not only with re|&s;pect to her per&s;on, but her accom|pli&s;hments and abilities; and, from
<PB N="16" REF="17">
the attention Sir George Warrington had paid her, conceived a hope, and not a very unnatural one, that in time &s;he might make &s;uch an entire con|que&s;t of his heart, as to induce him to offer her his hand: and this hope extending it&s;elf to the re&s;t of the fa|mily, our hero always met with &s;o flattering a reception at their hou&s;e as tempted him frequently to repeat his vi&s;its; and, as a &s;light return for their attentions, he u&s;ually reque&s;ted the favour of Mi&s;s Kettering's hand at the a&s;&s;emblies, to which he now became a &s;ub&s;criber. But though he actually preferred her, he &s;ome|times, to avoid particularity, danced with the Mi&s;s Bells, the clergyman's,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
or the Mi&s;s Bennets, the attorney's daughters, who were highly gratified by the honour, though they often envied Mi&s;s Kettering the more fre|quent opportunities &s;he had of at|tracting his notice; as, though they had not them&s;elves the lea&s;t preten|&s;ions to beauty, they could di&s;cover no other rea&s;on for his preference.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tate of affairs in Warrington Ca&s;tle and its neighbour|hood, at the time when this hi&s;tory opens.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Kettering had ordered her be&s;t carpet to be laid down in the drawing-room, the fringed covers to be laid on the mahogany chairs, and had taken out her be&s;t china, in ex|pectation of a party that evening, invited purpo&s;ely to meet Sir George Warrington, who had promi&s;ed his attendance; when all her views were di&s;concerted by the arrival of a me&s;|&s;enger on hor&s;eback, who, ha&s;tily re|lating the accident that had hap|pened, de&s;ired Mr. Kettering to return in&s;tantly to the ca&s;tle on his hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">The univer&s;ally known, but uni|ver&s;ally reprobated, maxim of Roche|foucault, that "in the di&s;tre&s;s of our be&s;t friends we always find &s;ome|thing that does not di&s;plea&s;e us," (of which at times all feel the truth, though all deny it) was now, though it mu&s;t be allowed an ex|traordinary in&s;tance, contradicted by Mrs Kettering and her fair daugh|ter: the misfortune of the Baronet could not afford them a ray of con|&s;olation; they lo&s;t his &s;ociety for the pre&s;ent, and feared they &s;hould lo&s;e the con&s;equence his frequent vi&s;its gave them among their neigh|bours. No more could Mi&s;s Anna Maria triumph, over her female ac|quaintance,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
or her devoted lovers, by declaring an engagement for the evening to Sir George Warrington. Thus was &s;he at once deprived of the fir&s;t privilege of beauty, and the fir&s;t gratification of friend&s;hip. What the other belles thought and &s;aid on the &s;ubject, we &s;hall not at pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;s; but, leaving the in|habitants of Bellingham to their va|rious opinions, return to Warring|ton Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t violence of the pain was abated, and our hero had lei&s;ure to reflect on his &s;ituation, the idea of &s;o long a confinement as Mr. Kettering had a&s;&s;ured him mu&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="22">
be the con&s;equence of the fracture, though it was by no means a dan|gerous one, in&s;pired him with a gloom his mind was before a &s;tranger to; and having in vain endeavoured to fix on a plan to render it le&s;s te|dious, he re&s;olved to con&s;ult his &s;ur|geon when he next vi&s;ited him. Ac|cordingly, that gentleman having felt his pul&s;e, and declared him more free from fever than he could have expected, our hero replied a little peevi&s;hly:</P>
<P>"What &s;ignifies being free from fever? The bone mu&s;t have time to grow together, and what &s;hall I do
<PB N="22" REF="23">
in the interim? I &s;hall die with wea|rine&s;s."</P>
<P>"But &s;urely," returned Mr. Ket|tering, "you will allow, the le&s;s fever you have, the &s;ooner your recovery will be perfect?"</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid Sir George, a little a&s;hamed of his impetuo&s;ity: "but how can I amu&s;e my&s;elf? My good friend, what &s;hall I do?"</P>
<P>"Do!" repeated the other: "why, you mu&s;t&mdash;you mu&s;t&mdash;'faith, you mu&s;t do what you plea&s;e." And with this decided advice, much re|&s;embling
<PB N="23" REF="24">
Par&s;on Barnabas's definition of chri&s;tian forgivene&s;s, he took leave of his patient more ha&s;tily than u&s;ual, le&s;t he &s;hould again be called upon for his opinion.</P>
<P>Our hero, unu&s;ed to controul, and always having had &s;omething on which to fix his thoughts, and the activity of his mind having never been before re&s;trained, found the pre&s;ent vacuum dreadful to a degree. Compelled not merely to give up his favourite amu&s;ements for the pre&s;ent, but unable to a&s;certain the period when he might again enjoy them, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to think on &s;ome &s;ub&s;titute to fill up the vacant hours.
<PB N="24" REF="25">
Conver&s;ation in the country is not always attainable; he had no friend or relation who could become an in|mate in his hou&s;e; and his common acquaintance were too much engro&s;&s;|ed by their own pur&s;uits, to &s;pend any time in a &s;ick chamber. Mr. Kettering's profe&s;&s;ion engaged him entirely; and his old tutor, Mr. Thom&s;on, attended too &s;trictly to the duties of a clergyman to have much lei&s;ure. He had, indeed, promi&s;ed Sir George, whom he loved with the tenderne&s;s of a parent, to devote to him all he could &s;pare from his more e&s;&s;ential avocations: but this our hero was &s;en&s;ible could not be more than an hour or two in the day; and
<PB N="25" REF="26">
how he &s;hould fill up the intermedi|ate &s;pace was a point he could not determine. Ringing the bell ha&s;tily, he ordered a &s;ervant to run to the par&s;onage, and tell Mr. Thom&s;on he de&s;ired to &s;ee him immediately. The &s;ervant obeyed: and when he had delivered the me&s;&s;age, the good Vicar enquired with much concern if he was wor&s;e; and being an&s;wered in the negative, and informed that Sir George only wanted to talk to him, he &s;miled, and bade John tell his ma&s;ter he would wait on him when he had gone his daily rounds in the village.</P>
<P>On his arrival at the Ca&s;tle, the
<PB N="26" REF="27">
young Baronet put the &s;ame que&s;tion to him he had before &s;o ineffectually addre&s;&s;ed to his Surgeon; but the re|ply was rather more &s;atisfactory: "I will," &s;aid the Vicar laughing, "put you in a way to amu&s;e your&s;elf. Read, if you have not forgotten how; and if you have, I will again take &s;ome pains to teach you."</P>
<P>Sir George coloured for a moment at the &s;arca&s;m of this &s;peech, con|&s;cious he de&s;erved it; but re&s;olving to take it as it was meant, good hu|mouredly, he thanked his old tutor a thou&s;and times for the hint, declar|ing it had not occurred to him be|fore, or he &s;hould not have been &s;o
<PB N="27" REF="28">
long at a lo&s;s for amu&s;ement. "And now," continued he, "conde&s;cend to direct my &s;tudies."</P>
<P>"Nay," returned Mr. Thom&s;on, "choo&s;e your own &s;ubject; and from either your (I beg your pardon, I mean your grandfather's) library, or my own, I may chance to &s;atisfy you."</P>
<P>"Oh!" replied Sir George, "I am at this in&s;tant a &s;trong proof of the caprice of human nature. Confined as I now am to my bed, I feel a martial ardour glowing in my heart, and could wi&s;h my&s;elf a &s;econd Alexander."</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">"I hope not," interrupted the Vicar: "you are much better as Sir George Warrington."</P>
<P>"Well, my good friend! But, &s;e|riou&s;ly, give me the hi&s;tory of wars and conque&s;ts. Let me have the Liad for the pre&s;ent, and to-morrow &s;end me &s;omething el&s;e."</P>
<P>"In the original, I pre&s;ume?" re|turned Mr. Thom&s;on.</P>
<P>"P&s;haw!" &s;aid the Baronet, half peevi&s;hly, yet half laughing.</P>
<P>"Well," replied the other, "you &s;hall have Pope's tran&s;lation; and I
<PB N="29" REF="30">
will look for it directly: if not in your hou&s;e, I know it is in mine." He then took leave, and, going to the library, found it with &s;ome trouble; but it was entirely covered with du&s;t, as well as the re&s;t of a very valuable collection. He would not permit the &s;ervant to wipe it, but reque&s;ted he would take it fir&s;t to his ma&s;ter, hoping the appearance would &s;trike him with &s;hame&mdash;as it really did. Mr. Thom&s;on, however, returned home well plea&s;ed with this proof, that our hero had not, as he once feared, lo&s;t all reli&s;h for &s;tudy; and endeavoured to &s;elect &s;uch books as would both amu&s;e his mind and form his manners, and at the &s;ame
<PB N="30" REF="31">
time give him a ta&s;te for polite literature. Accordingly, he that af|ternoon looked out &s;uch authors as were be&s;t adapted to his purpo&s;e, and &s;ent them up to the Ca&s;tle, re|&s;olving to call the following day to ob&s;erve how his pupil went on.</P>
<P>To dwell no longer on a part of the hi&s;tory de&s;igned merely as an introduction to the re&s;t, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that our hero made the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of his confinement, by well cultivating his mind, which had been too long neglected; but, though he attended in turn to every branch of &s;cience, the &s;ubjects that mo&s;t engaged his attention were the
<PB N="31" REF="32">
de&s;criptions of wars, particularly where the hero had emancipated his country from &s;lavery and &s;ubjection. Pa&s;cal Paoli was the object of his warme&s;t admiration; nor were the characters of the elder and younger Brutus le&s;s re&s;pected and e&s;teemed; and he &s;ighed to render his own name equally famous to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>One day, &s;peaking on the &s;ubject to his Surgeon, that gentleman &s;eri|ou&s;ly advi&s;ed him to go into the militia; &s;aying, there was a cap|tain's commi&s;&s;ion to be had, and that, as he did not mean to be in Parlia|ment, he ought to &s;erve his country in &s;ome way; and added as a farther
<PB N="32" REF="33">
rea&s;on, a red coat and cockade would become him extremely, as all the young ladies of Bellingham agreed. Our hero &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;mile with &s;ome difficulty, and then turned the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his mind was in this &s;tate, Mr. Thom&s;on received &s;ome new pub|lications from a friend in London, which without peru&s;ing him&s;elf he &s;ent in&s;tantly to the Ca&s;tle, where they were received by Sir George with particular &s;atisfaction; and he read them with avidity and delight, as unfortunately they were too well adapted to the pre&s;ent frame of his mind. Among them were Paine's
<PB N="33" REF="34">
Rights of Man, a Hi&s;tory of the French Revolution, and a variety of books written evidently in its favour; &s;ome of them containing a de&s;crip|tion, and I fear too ju&s;t a one, of the cruelties practi&s;ed on the people by tho&s;e in power. The narrative of Henry de la Tude fired his brea&s;t with an hone&s;t indignation; and the idea of re&s;toring liberty to an op|pre&s;&s;ed nation excited in him the &s;tronge&s;t wi&s;h of joining &s;o noble, &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a party. Till now he had never concerned him&s;elf with the politics of the day, and indeed &s;carcely ever be&s;towed a thought on the national welfare, though he had been early taught by his father to
<PB N="34" REF="35">
dete&s;t courtiers, and all their train of &s;ervile flatterers; but at this time, when his mind was filled with mi|litary ardour, the &s;ubject of his &s;tudies was well calculated to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. A de&s;ire of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the patriots with advice and money was his fir&s;t idea; but univer&s;al liberty and ge|neral equality next taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his imagination, he became al|mo&s;t mad to forward a plan that promi&s;ed &s;uch unbounded good to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>He communicated the&s;e new &s;en|timents to his good friend the Vicar, who &s;ilently lamented his infatua|tion,

and could not forgive him&s;elf for being the cau&s;e, though the in|nocent one, of the&s;e wild intentions: but knowing, "though you may turn the current of a rivulet, you cannot check the progre&s;s of a torrent," he determined to give way to this fury of liberty, tru&s;ting it would prove only the impul&s;e of a moment. But here he was mi&s;taken: Sir George never gave up a cau&s;e in which he embarked, till its impropriety was clear to his own feelings; and he now lamented the years he had pa&s;&s;ed in inglorious ea&s;e and blamable in|activity; determining at the &s;ame time, the moment he was allowed by his Surgeon to undertake the journey
<PB N="36" REF="37">
and voyage, to go over to Paris, and then act as he &s;hould think proper. Having fully &s;ettled this with him|&s;elf, he imparted his intention to Mr. Thom&s;on; who, after vainly en|deavouring to di&s;&s;uade him from it, at la&s;t entreated him in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn manner not to think of going to a country like France, torn with inte&s;tine commotions, at lea&s;t with|out a companion better acquainted with the language and manners of the country than him&s;elf; and this, after &s;ome he&s;itation, he promi&s;ed, &s;aying he would fir&s;t go to London, and there enquire for &s;ome gentle|man to accompany him in the capa|city he required.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">Mr. Thom&s;on was obliged to be &s;atisfied with this promi&s;e: but he took leave of his young friend in a very different frame of mind from that in which he had entered the Ca&s;tle; alternately accu&s;ing him&s;elf and his democratic corre&s;pondent in London, who had &s;elected the&s;e books evidently with a view of converting our good Vicar, to who&s;e hone&s;t and loyal principles he was no &s;tranger. But in this he erred: Mr. Thom&s;on's judgment was too clear, and his principles too excel|lent, to be perverted by arguments of the mo&s;t fallacious kind, that tend only to de&s;troy the happine&s;s Britons have &s;o long enjoyed, under

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Kettering paid his next vi&s;it to our hero, for he now only attended him occa&s;ionally, he entered upon his favourite topic with all the warmth which his heart expe|rienced. The other li&s;tened with attention and &s;urpri&s;e; for the idea of &s;acrificing the lea&s;t convenience him&s;elf for the benefit of another man, or even a whole &s;ociety, was not among his li&s;t of chri&s;tian duties. Sir George having expatiated on his intended tour, and the advantages all the nation might receive from his
<PB N="40" REF="41">
new re&s;olutions, and the exertions he &s;hould make in con&s;equence of them, the Surgeon replied:</P>
<P>"Why, as for the matter of that, Sir George, I do not &s;ee why you &s;hould go abroad among them there French people, to be cut to pieces perhaps, and the like of that, as they are now doing to one another, when you might &s;tay here in Northumber|land, and &s;leep in a whole &s;kin. To be &s;ure, if you plea&s;e, you may make ducks and drakes of your money; becau&s;e you have enough of it, and that there's no body to call you to an account; but I know what I know: if I had an e&s;tate of &s;ix thou&s;and a
<PB N="41" REF="42">
year, why I'd &s;tay and &s;pend it all in old England; and enjoy my&s;elf, and live as I liked, and, if I plea&s;ed, marry the prettie&s;t girl in the coun|ty; for what &s;ignifies money, when there's enough on one &s;ide?"</P>
<P>Mr. Kettering here ended his cu|rious harangue, of which our hero under&s;tood not the whole force; for, totally ignorant of the ways of the world, he overlooked the kind hint with re&s;pect to his daughter, and continued explaining his future intentions. The doctrine of equa|lity was by no means unplea&s;ing to his companion, who, like mo&s;t other people who indulge this idea, only
<PB N="42" REF="43">
con&s;idered that Sir George would be reduced to his level, without re|collecting that his inferiors would be rai&s;ed to it. Indeed, at this mo|ment, he thought of nothing but the probability of the Baronet's mar|rying his daughter, if he continued in the&s;e &s;entiments; and re&s;olving, according to the old &s;aying,
<Q>to &s;trike while the iron was hot,</Q>
he contrived before they parted to hint, that, as he was now able to get into the drawing-room, he would bring over his wife and daughter to drink a di&s;h of tea with him, if agreeable. To this Sir George politely a&s;|&s;ented, &s;aying, the ladies would do him great honour; and, &s;oon after,
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Mr. Kettering took leave, impatient to communicate the Baronet's inten|tion to his family.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Kettering received this intelligence with a le&s;s degree of plea|&s;ure than he expected; for, though equally plea&s;ed with the idea of be|ing con&s;idered on an equality with him, and delighted at the intended vi&s;it, yet his meditated excur&s;ion di&s;concerted all her views; as &s;he too rationally feared a farther knowledge of the world might le&s;&s;en the regard &s;he at pre&s;ent hoped he felt for her fair daughter, who her&s;elf, too gay and too carele&s;s to look beyond the pa&s;&s;ing moment, thought only on
<PB N="44" REF="45">
what dre&s;s &s;he &s;hould wear to the Ca&s;tle; and in the intermediate time made a point of calling on the Mi&s;s Bells and the Mi&s;s Bennets, on purpo&s;e to give them notice of her vi&s;it: but, not choo&s;ing to do it in expre&s;s terms, &s;he contrived to hint a wi&s;h for fine weather; and this draw|ing on the que&s;tion &s;he hoped for, &s;he replied, her papa was that af|ternoon to drive her mamma and her|&s;elf over to Warrington Ca&s;tle, to &s;ee poor Sir George, who had parti|cularly reque&s;ted their company.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;urpri&s;e the&s;e young la|dies might feel, they cho&s;e not to re|veal it, le&s;t they &s;hould add to the
<PB N="45" REF="46">
triumph that was &s;o evidently painted on her countenance; and therefore coolly replied, "After &s;o long a con|finement, it was no wonder Sir George wanted a little variety." Di&s;|appointed by their manner of receiv|ing her intelligence, &s;he returned home to prepare for her little excur|&s;ion; fully proving, that an envious and little mind is incapable of feel|ing true &s;atisfaction, as her own plea|&s;ure was le&s;&s;ened, if not de&s;troyed, by her ineffectual endeavours to give pain to others.</P>
<P>It is a general and too true an ob|&s;ervation, that more quarrels ari&s;e in families from trifles than from things
<PB N="46" REF="47">
of con&s;equence; as every creature &s;uppo&s;es the others may give up what is &s;o immaterial, though they are them&s;elves too tenacious to yield in a &s;ingle point. When Mi&s;s Anna Maria entered the parlour, &s;he found her papa and mamma engaged in a violent di&s;pute on their method of travelling: Mr. Kettering in&s;i&s;ting on driving them in their own whi&s;ky, as he was to vi&s;it a patient a few miles farther, and intended to leave them at Warrington Ca&s;tle, and call for them on his return; and Mrs. Kettering remon&s;trating that, as the day was &s;howery, it would be more comfortable as well as more genteel to hire a po&s;t-chai&s;e; but &s;he
<PB N="47" REF="48">
remon&s;trated in vain. Mrs. Kette|ring had rea&s;on on her &s;ide, but we daily &s;ee that rea&s;on does not always conquer; &s;he was obliged to yield: but &s;he did it with a very ill grace, and &s;at down to table, muttering, "it was very hard that people would &s;crape and &s;ave for a farthing, when they need not be &s;o &s;tingy, as all the world knew they could do very hand&s;omely if they would." Her hu&s;|band either did not or would not hear this ob&s;ervation, but helped him|&s;elf to &s;ome mutton, and for a few moments peace was re&s;tored; as Mi&s;s Nancy, though evidently on her mamma's &s;ide, did not dare take a de|cided part in the di&s;pute: but, before
<PB N="48" REF="49">
the cloth was removed, it was renewed with more violence on another &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Kettering de&s;ired the ladies would be ready early, as he wi&s;hed to go on to &s;ee his patient. Mrs. Kettering replied, it would be ex|tremely vulgar to be at the Ca&s;tle before &s;ix o'clock, and, if he cho&s;e to be there earlier, he might go by him&s;elf. Here Mrs. Kettering had not rea&s;on on her &s;ide; yet &s;he pre|vailed. "I will not," is a &s;entence &s;ometimes of great power; and Mr. Kettering, tired of oppo&s;ition, and perceiving, as he had gained one point, the other would not be yielded without more trouble than he cho&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="50">
to be&s;tow, at length, after a little more argument, gave it up. Per|haps &s;he might have compounded, had he offered the po&s;t-chai&s;e: but here &s;elf-intere&s;t prevailed, as it al|ways did in his bo&s;om; and he ra|ther cho&s;e his patient &s;hould remain perhaps an hour or two longer with|out relief, than pay a few &s;hillings extraordinary in chai&s;e-hire. He now left the room to prepare his me|dicines; for, as is the ca&s;e in mo&s;t provincial towns, in him the pro|fe&s;&s;ions of apothecary and &s;urgeon were united.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Anna Maria now deigning to con&s;ult her mother on &s;ome points
<PB N="50" REF="51">
of her dre&s;s, &s;he de&s;ired her to wear a riding habit, as mo&s;t proper for the carriage they were to go in: and here let me digre&s;s a moment to ob|&s;erve, that Mrs. Kettering had, ge|nerally &s;peaking, more &s;en&s;e as well as judgment than the re&s;t of the family, though &s;he had &s;eldom the good fortune to be able to make u&s;e of it, for a rea&s;on the reader will readily gue&s;s. Mi&s;s Nancy flatly refu&s;ed; and, when her mother in&s;i&s;ted on it, flounced out of the room, &s;aying, "indeed, at her age, &s;he thought &s;he might at lea&s;t dre&s;s as &s;he plea&s;ed." Here Mrs. Kettering was a &s;econd time right, though her advice was again unattended to. She had,
<PB N="51" REF="52">
however, the &s;atisfaction of know|ing &s;he had gained one point in three; and though reflection told her &s;he was in that in&s;tance wrong, a wi&s;h of keeping up all the autho|rity &s;he could, prevented her from owning it. Nor is this an un|common in&s;tance: tho&s;e who are con&s;tantly contradicted &s;ometimes take up the wrong &s;ide of an argu|ment, and maintain it with the more po&s;itivene&s;s, from re&s;entment at be|ing generally oppo&s;ed, and a de&s;ire of obtaining their own way for once, though even by wrong means.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AT the appointed time Mr. Ket|tering's one-hor&s;e chai&s;e, or rather whi&s;ky, drove up to the door; for, as it was principally intended for him to vi&s;it his patients, when di&s;inclined to mount his hor&s;e, it was built in the lighte&s;t manner, and without a head, that it might move with the greater expedition. That gentleman, hav|ing handed in his wife and daughter, found &s;ome difficulty in &s;eating him|&s;elf in a carriage by no means calcu|lated for family parties. Slowly and heavily, therefore, the old mare
<PB N="53" REF="54">
dragged them up the hill going out of the town; and before they had pro|ceeded three miles of the five, which &s;eparated Bellingham from Warring|ton Ca&s;tle, the &s;ky was overca&s;t, and threatened a hard &s;hower. It was now that Mrs. Kettering exulted in her &s;agacity; and, looking alternately at her hu&s;band and daughter, &s;he would have compared her&s;elf to Ca&s;&s;andra of Troy, had &s;he known the &s;tory; but, as &s;he did not, was contented with &s;aying, "it was &s;ome people's mi&s;|fortune never to be believed, though they were always in the right."</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of contradiction, which &s;ome authors very cruelly, as well
<PB N="54" REF="55">
as very unju&s;tly, a&s;cribe peculiarly to the fair &s;ex, now, however, did take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lady; and &s;he wi&s;hed for rain, almo&s;t as earne&s;tly as a farmer in a drought. Indeed &s;he had little rea&s;on to fear it on her own account; as &s;he had equipped her&s;elf for the purpo&s;e in a rich &s;ilk gown and petticoat, over which &s;he wore a camblet &s;afeguard, and had farther &s;ecured her&s;elf by a cala&s;h and long cloak, made of hatband &s;ilk, the fruits of her hu&s;band's la|bours.</P>
<P>The fair Anna Maria had more cau&s;e to dread a &s;hower, being dre&s;&s;ed in a thin mu&s;lin jacket and coat over
<PB N="55" REF="56">
a dyed purple &s;ilk, a &s;a&s;h and bon|net of the &s;ame colour (the lat|ter edged with a deep veil of Briti&s;h lace), and a black gauze cloak. She therefore viewed the approaching &s;torm with very different &s;en&s;ations; and, when the rain fir&s;t came on, put up an umbrella, which was her &s;ole dependance. In times of di&s;tre&s;s and danger, we &s;hould be very cer|tain of the &s;teadine&s;s of that friend for whom we have di&s;claimed all other protection; le&s;t, like the fair Anna, we &s;hould, by their de&s;ertion, be left to &s;truggle alone with the bitter winds of adver&s;ity. Boreas, that day unfortunately recollecting his contention with Phoebus, in which
<PB N="56" REF="57">
the latter conquered, now in a rage re&s;olved to mu&s;ter all his forces, and attack the fir&s;t mortal who fell in his way, determined not to be again vanqui&s;hed. Unhappily the fir&s;t object was Mi&s;s Kettering; who&s;e umbrella, like a faithle&s;s ally, made no re&s;i&s;tance, but yielded at the fir&s;t attack, and left her expo&s;ed to "the pelting of the pitile&s;s &s;torm:" and pitile&s;s indeed it was, for it com|pletely deranged every part of her attire. Her bonnet was the fir&s;t victim of its fury; the rain &s;potted the lilac &s;ilk, and &s;hrunk up the Briti&s;h lace veil. Her gauze cloak and mu&s;lin petticoat received &s;everal mortal wounds, from her endeavours
<PB N="57" REF="58">
to keep her umbrella from ab&s;olute flight; and, in other places, the rain, drawing out the purple dye, marked the mu&s;lin with en&s;anguined &s;treams. Her black pins and powder, like cowards, fled from the field of battle; but the pomatum &s;till adhered: which gave her head no &s;mall re&s;em+blance to that of the ancient lady well known by the name of Medu|&s;a; though it mu&s;t be allowed her face was not one that would turn the hearts of beholders into &s;tone, though it had often the power of &s;corching them to cinders.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t between Boreas, the umbrella, and Mi&s;s Kettering, con|tinued
<PB N="58" REF="59">
till they were within &s;ight of the park gates; when an accident decided the victory, or rather put an end to the battle: in &s;hort, going over a very rugged piece of road, one of the wheels gave way, and, though it did not ab&s;olutely overturn them, it obliged the whole party to proceed on foot: and this put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the young lady's appearance; as the dirt in a very few minutes formed a black border to her white dre&s;s, and rendered the yellow &s;tripes in her &s;lippers undi&s;tingui&s;h|able. Angry with her&s;elf for not taking her mother's advice, but more angry with her mother for &s;ome oc|ca&s;ional &s;allies of triumph which had
<PB N="59" REF="60">
e&s;caped her lips; mortified at the idea of being &s;een by Sir George in &s;o lamentable a &s;tate, yet not know|ing how to avoid it; &s;he bur&s;t into tears of mingled pa&s;&s;ion and grief: when the footman, who had been &s;ent by his ma&s;ter, opened the gate to receive them. Sir George him&s;elf &s;tood at the window, watching their progre&s;s, which was very &s;low; and when, from their advancing nearer, he di&s;covered their &s;ituation, he imme|diately di&s;patched the hou&s;ekeeper to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in repairing the acci|dents of the afternoon. To add to Anna Maria's vexation, young Mr. Bennet, who had been at the Ca&s;tle on bu&s;ine&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed them on hor&s;eback
<PB N="60" REF="61">
ju&s;t before they entered the hou&s;e, and was con&s;equently a witne&s;s of their deranged appearance; which &s;he was very con&s;cious he would not only enjoy, but report with exagge|rations, as he had been an un&s;ucce&s;s|ful candidate for her favour, and at|tributed this to her penchant for the Baronet.</P>
<P>When the ladies were a little refit|ted, they entered the drawing-room; where Sir George received them with all po&s;&s;ible politene&s;s, and many ex|pre&s;&s;ions of concern for the misfor|tunes of the day; which he al&s;o en|deavoured to counteract, by &s;ending Mr. Kettering to his patient on one
<PB N="61" REF="62">
of his own hor&s;es, and offering them the carriage on their return. The delay occa&s;ioned by this accident, and their con&s;equent change of dre&s;s, added to Mrs. Kettering's etiquette of not arriving too early, made it con&s;iderably pa&s;t &s;even when the tea was brought in; and, as the carriage was ordered at half pa&s;t eight, the evening was not too long. Nothing material occurred; except that Sir George, who&s;e mind was now in a &s;tate of improvement, was &s;urpri&s;ed he &s;hould have con&s;idered Mi&s;s Ket|tering in any other light than that of a pretty girl; for, in fact, &s;he had no preten&s;ions to wi&s;dom, and her wit was of that innocent &s;pecies,
<PB N="62" REF="63">
which neither outs nor dazzles; con|&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing chiefly of quaint &s;ayings, not very unlike Swift's polite conver&s;a|tion; and this was natural to her, and not acquired by any &s;tudy of the book in que&s;tion. He al&s;o promi&s;ed to return their vi&s;it before he left the country; and this, added to the delight of going home in his coach, &s;eemed to atone for every pa&s;t evil. But
<Q><L>Every white will have its black,</L>
<L>And every &s;weet its &s;our:</L></Q>
for Mi&s;s Anna Maria could &s;carcely enjoy this plea&s;ure, from recollecting it would not be vi&s;ible to their neigh|bours, as it mu&s;t be dark before they could arrive at home. This,
<PB N="63" REF="64">
however, &s;he con&s;oled her&s;elf for, by reflecting &s;he could tell it the next day; for, in fact, &s;he con&s;idered it as only preceding the offer of his hand.</P>
<P>They took leave of the Baronet with a profu&s;ion of thanks for his ci|vilities, and reached their own hou&s;e in the utmo&s;t harmony: but this was &s;oon at an end; for, reviving the events of the day after &s;upper, they each accu&s;ed the other of having in &s;ome degree cau&s;ed their misfortunes, not reflecting they were equally to blame them&s;elves. Had Mr. Kette|ring hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e, they would have e&s;caped the rain wholly; had Mrs. Kettering con&s;ented to &s;et out an
<PB N="64" REF="65">
hour earlier, they would have been &s;afe at the Ca&s;tle; or, had Mi&s;s Nancy yielded to her mamma's entreaties, &s;he might have been free from the mortifications &s;he &s;o de&s;ervedly met with. Thus, reproaching each other's conduct without correcting their own, they pa&s;&s;ed the hours till they parted for the night.</P>

<P>IN the mean time our hero, who was now perfectly recovered, &s;ettled all his affairs previous to his intended jour|ney; and, not unmindful of his pro|mi&s;e, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Mrs. Kette|ring, to inform her he would wait on them the following afternoon; and that lady immediately wrote cards to her principal acquaintance, inviting them to meet the Baronet. At the u&s;ual hour the party a&s;&s;embled in her drawing-room, con&s;i&s;ting of the Bells, the Bennets, the Browns, the Jones's,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
an officer or two who were quartered in the town, and a Mi&s;s Carruther, of whom it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak more fully.</P>
<P>This lady was the daughter of a gentleman of good e&s;tate in a county &s;outh-we&s;t of London; but, at his death finding her&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of only five or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, &s;he took a hand&s;ome lodging in the town near which &s;he had always lived, and con|tinued there for &s;everal years in credit and comfort; as her brother, who was married to a very amiable wo|man, re&s;ided con&s;tantly at the man|&s;ion-hou&s;e, where &s;he was always a welcome gue&s;t; and in her own circle
<PB N="67" REF="68">
was equally re&s;pected and e&s;teemed. It was therefore a great &s;urpri&s;e to her friends, particularly to her brother, when, all on a &s;udden, &s;he formed the re&s;olution of leaving her native place, and &s;ettling in &s;ome di&s;tant &s;pot. No creature could gue&s;s the rea&s;on, and it became the &s;ubject of univer&s;al en|quiry; but in vain: &s;he had the &s;en&s;e to conceal it in her own bo&s;om, and it was not to be di&s;covered. Mi&s;s Carruther, exclu&s;ive of a few annual excur&s;ions to Bath and London, had lived two-and-forty years within a circle of five miles, and was now ar|rived at that period when the term "young lady" was dropped by all who knew her, except her milliner and
<PB N="68" REF="69">
mantua-maker; who, it has been often ob&s;erved, be&s;tow the epithet "young" more liberally on tho&s;e who have lo&s;t all proper claim to it, and who &s;eldom hear it from their general acquaintance: thereby &s;hewing their extreme benevolence and charity. Among a thou&s;and virtues, Mi&s;s Car|ruther had one foible, which fre|quently led her to think and act in the mo&s;t ridiculous manner: this was a horror of growing old unmar|ried, and con&s;equently a de&s;ire of youth. She had never been a hand|&s;ome, though always what the world calls a well-looking woman; and her fortune, though a genteel independ|ence, not &s;ufficient, according to the
<PB N="69" REF="70">
&s;tyle in which &s;he had been educated, to &s;ecure her any advantageous offers: &s;he was therefore not merely &s;ingle at this time, but likely to remain &s;o. Her plan was now, to quit a place where her age was &s;o well known, that &s;ome accident di&s;covered it in every company; and perhaps the ill-natured of her own &s;ex, who unhap|pily are too numerous, had di&s;cerned her foible, and delighted to avail them&s;elves of it.</P>
<P>Sometimes a lady, with a tall daughter of fifteen at her elbow, would exclaim: "Talking of dre&s;s my dear Emily, do you remember that beautiful negligee you had of pink and white &s;attin, and your Bru&s;&s;els
<PB N="70" REF="71">
lace treble ruffles? Oh! how I en|vied you, and how angry I was with my aunt for keeping me in a robe coat, when, though your junior by a year or two, I thought my&s;elf as well entitled to a &s;acque as your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>Sometimes their tall daughters would remind the unfortunate Emily of frolics with their mammas at the boarding-&s;chool, and expre&s;s a wi&s;h of equalling their exploits. Some|times a dear friend would entreat her opinion of a player who had quitted the &s;tage above five-and-twenty years, or beg her to recollect the celebrated &s;ong of Signor, or Signora, at the &s;ame period.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">On the&s;e unhappy occa&s;ions, Mi&s;s Carruther acted according to the im|pul&s;e of the moment. Sometimes &s;he had forgotten the circum&s;tance, and in&s;tantly changed the conver&s;a|tion: and &s;ometimes &s;he would en|deavour to laugh; but her efforts were like tho&s;e of an incognito au|thor who hears his works burle&s;qued, and is obliged to join in the ridicule le&s;t the company &s;hould &s;u&s;pect they were indebted to him for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion of &s;hewing their wit.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Carruther now fled the &s;ociety of her old friends, and joined the younger people; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who, from having only lately &s;ettled in the

town, could not know the date of her birth: but here &s;he experienced new troubles from the re&s;pect they paid to &s;eniority. Her tea was al|ways handed fir&s;t; &s;he was led to the upper part of the table; and, in par|ties of plea&s;ure, her company was often reque&s;ted with particular ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, and enforced by the young la|dies' &s;aying: "Oh, dear Madam, pray do not refu&s;e us; my mamma cannot be with us to-day, and &s;he will not con&s;ent to our going, unle&s;s you will take us under your protection: for &s;he &s;ays you are &s;uch a prudent woman, &s;he may tru&s;t us &s;afely."</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, that at an age
<PB N="73" REF="74">
when prudence is become a more va|luable virtue than it once was, from its pre&s;ent &s;carcity, that any one &s;hould di&s;claim its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? "Yet &s;uch things were;" and the term "pru|dent woman" never failed to give Mi&s;s Carrtuher a head-ach, or &s;ome other illne&s;s, which prevented her compli|ance. From the frequency of her re|fu&s;als, the truth was at la&s;t &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome &s;aucy girls of &s;eventeen; who, aware of their pa&s;t indi&s;cretion, now re&s;olved to atone for it, by wording their invitations in a different man|ner. This &s;ucceeded for them; but Mi&s;s Carruther was &s;till doomed to perpetual mortifications, either from de&s;ign or accident: for the honour
<PB N="74" REF="75">
of the &s;ex, I will hope it was the latter: and, from the&s;e events, &s;he re&s;olved to quit her "plea&s;ant native plains," where no longer "wing'd with bli&s;s the moments flew," and &s;eek at a di&s;tance that peace &s;he was there de|nied.</P>
<P>Here let me digre&s;s a moment to ob&s;erve, that at every age women are not only re&s;pectable, but e&s;timable, when they act in character; but, if a lady bordering on forty-five will conde&s;cend to wear feathers, flowers, &amp;c. and in other re&s;pects dre&s;s like a girl who has ju&s;t left boarding-&s;chool, &s;he cannot hope to meet with any thing but contempt and deri&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76">Mi&s;s Carruther tried Bath and Lon|don in vain: &s;he had been too much in the world not to meet with a va|riety of her old acquaintance in either place; which did not &s;uit her plan: therefore, after rambling three years, &s;he at length di&s;charged an old &s;er|vant in London, who had almo&s;t brought her up, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;ay, "I love my mi&s;tre&s;s, and have lived with her near forty years;" and took a young girl, a &s;tranger, hired a new footman, and with the&s;e attendants &s;et out for Northumberland, where &s;he determined to fix her re&s;idence; and, being much plea&s;ed with Bel|lingham, hired a &s;mall hou&s;e, and re&s;olved to continue there, unle&s;s, as

<P>At Bellingham &s;he had been &s;ix months, and was now bordering on that fatal yet happy time, which puts a period at once to the hopes and fears that for ten years before float in the female mind: for who is there that, when they have &s;een half a century in this world, will not endeavour to reconcile them&s;elves to their &s;tate of old maidi&s;m, as Mr. Hayley terms it? And tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed that barrier, without doing any thing vo|luntarily to forfeit the title of pru|dent women, may e&s;teem them&s;elves particularly fortunate; &s;ince in&s;tances
<PB N="77" REF="78">
daily occur, where every advantage of life is bartered to avoid the hated name of old maid.&mdash;To return to our hi&s;tory&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Carruther, as a woman of &s;en&s;e, con&s;equence, and fortune, was vi&s;ited and courted by all the inhabitants of Bellingham, and now, at Mrs. Kette|ring's, &s;hone, in all but youth and beauty, eminently &s;uperior to the re&s;t: and there was &s;omething in her manner &s;o &s;trikingly fa&s;hionable, that our hero, who no longer thought like a mere ru&s;tic, was &s;truck with it; and beginning a conver&s;ation with her, in which &s;he di&s;played much good &s;en&s;e and knowledge of the world, he &s;at

by her the remainder of the evening. It is true, the peculiar ea&s;e of Mi&s;s Carruther's behaviour was owing to her having heard the current report of the town, that the Baronet was engaged to Mi&s;s Kettering; and con|&s;equently, imagining his attentions to her were either accidental, or a&s;&s;umed to conceal the &s;tate of his heart from the re&s;t of the company, endeavoured to amu&s;e, without &s;eeking to attract him. The young ladies, particularly Anna Maria, were much piqued at his preference; but, to hide their cha|grin from each other, entertained them&s;elves with laughing at the ob|ject.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">It is the part of a faithful hi&s;torian to relate the bad as well as the good traits in every character; or I would keep it a &s;ecret from the world, that Mi&s;s Carruther was, from her dre&s;s that evening, too ju&s;t a theme for ri|dicule. She had &s;tudied &s;implicity. Her gown was a white mu&s;lin che|mi&s;e, extremely long every way: her &s;a&s;h, pale pink; her &s;lippers had flat heels; and, in the prevailing mode of the year ninety-two, her hair was combed on her forehead, and hung on her neck in light curls, without pomatum, and &s;carcely any powder. Her cap was of mu&s;lin with a nar|row &s;tripe, which a ribbon, the colour of her &s;a&s;h, bound tight to her head.
<PB N="80" REF="81">
Altogether, as &s;he was a tall woman, &s;he gave an idea of a Brobdinagian infant, half tucked, and ju&s;t learning to walk.</P>
<P>Could our ance&s;tors ri&s;e from their graves, they would not, as &s;ome peo|ple fooli&s;hly imagine, have any cau&s;e to reproach the pre&s;ent age with ex|travagance in their dre&s;s; as tho&s;e who have &s;tudied the manners of old times a&s;&s;ure us, that they were more guilty in tho&s;e points than our&s;elves; nor were their fa&s;hions le&s;s eccentric or ridiculous, as the high pointed &s;hoe, fa&s;tened to their girdles with chains, &s;ufficiently evinces. But to the ladies of the eighteenth century it
<PB N="81" REF="82">
has been re&s;erved, to dre&s;s like in|fants in long frocks: di&s;daining the foreign aid of gold brocades and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ues, they &s;eek to charm by native &s;implicity, and endeavour to recall the ideas of each beholder to that period, when innocence was their only characteri&s;tic; binding their "baby brows," not with "the round and top of &s;overeignty," but with a gay ribbon or a mu&s;lin band.</P>
<P>This new mode of dre&s;s, having only been conveyed to Mi&s;s Carru|ther in a letter from a fa&s;hionable corre&s;pondent, had not yet publicly reached Bellingham, and therefore excited &s;urpri&s;e in all the young la|dies
<PB N="82" REF="83">
of that place, who were them|&s;elves attired in &s;tiff calendered gowns and &s;ilk petticoats, with their hair in full friz, and very much powdered: yet, whil&s;t all pretended to laugh at, they all &s;ecretly re&s;olved to copy her, each hoping to be the fir&s;t in the fa|&s;hion.</P>
<P>The events of the evening were not numerous, and indeed &s;carcely worth recording: a &s;ummons to the card-table put an end to the t&ecirc;te &agrave;-t&ecirc;te be|tween the Baronet and Mi&s;s Carru|ther, as well as to the remarks of the re&s;t of the company. The game was commerce; and all the young people &s;at down to it. Mi&s;s Kette|ring,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
re&s;olving to &s;trike one bold &s;troke to attain her purpo&s;e, called to Sir George, and a&s;ked him where he would choo&s;e to &s;it? and he of cour&s;e replying, "by her;" when the fir&s;t deal was at an end, and that lady was de|clared to be the winner, young Ben|net with a loud laugh &s;aid, he &s;up|po&s;ed Sir George cheated for her. Sir George, unaccu&s;tomed to com|pany, and &s;carcely ever playing cards, did not take this in the light it was intended, merely as a je&s;t (for he was yet to learn that cheating for the ladies is an honourable action), but thought it a reproach, and re|&s;ented it accordingly. Mr. James Bennet, frightened to death, made
<PB N="84" REF="85">
very humble conce&s;&s;ions, which &s;oon appea&s;ed the wrath of the Baronet; and this taught the young attorney a le&s;&s;on he never forgot, namely, not to je&s;t with his &s;uperiors. However, for &s;ome time it di&s;turbed the peace of the whole party.</P>
<P>When the pool drew towards a con|clu&s;ion, it was only di&s;puted between our hero and Mi&s;s Carruther; and the former, throwing away purpo&s;ely a wrong card, decided it for her. Mi&s;s Kettering, who witne&s;&s;ed this tran&s;ac|tion, was extremely piqued at what &s;he e&s;teemed a mark of di&s;tinction in Mi&s;s Carruther's favour, though it was merely the effects of a natural
<PB N="85" REF="86">
courte&s;y of manners; and had the folly to exclaim, in a loud whi&s;per to Mi&s;s Bennet, that her brother was in the right, for Sir George now cheat|ed for Mi&s;s Carruther. That lady &s;miled di&s;dainfully; and Sir George replied coolly, yet half laughing, that "he had always under&s;tood he might cheat him&s;elf when he plea&s;ed."</P>
<P>His carriage was now announced; and with a general bow to the com|pany, and a particular addre&s;s to the Kettering family, intimating, as he was &s;oon to quit the country, that he &s;hould &s;carcely have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them again, and therefore wi&s;hed them health and happine&s;s, he
<PB N="86" REF="87">
took leave; and they remained in a &s;tate of utter a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;|may, as they had no idea his plan was to be put into immediate execu|tion. The fair Anna Maria was par|ticularly agitated, and was for &s;ome time uncertain whether &s;he &s;hould not fall into hy&s;teric fits; but hap|pily recollecting it would only be a means of informing the company of the extent of her mortification, wi&s;ely, and without much difficulty, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed them; and contented her&s;elf with mental accu&s;ations of the Ba|ronet, whom &s;he thought the ba&s;e&s;t of his &s;ex.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sir George was
<PB N="87" REF="88">
wholly uncon&s;cious of having de|&s;erved the&s;e reproaches: he had, it is true, during the few months after his father's death vi&s;ited at their hou&s;e occa&s;ionally, and &s;ometimes danced with her: he had behaved, when they mer, with the gallantry due to a pretty woman, but had never by word or action given her rea&s;on to believe he was attached; nor during his long confinement had expre&s;&s;ed any wi&s;h to &s;ee her, till Mr. Kettering of|fered him a vi&s;it from his family; and, on that evening as well as this, had acted conformably to his &s;enti|ments, which were tho&s;e of perfect indifference. In fact, the only thing even Mi&s;s Kettering her&s;elf could
<PB N="88" REF="89">
accu&s;e him of mi&s;leading her hopes in, was the offer of the carriage, which was merely civility, though, in her high-flown ideas, &s;he had given it a &s;tronger motive. But her expec|tations were by this vi&s;it wholly cru&s;hed; as the lea&s;t &s;he hoped for was, that, by a marked attention, he would convince all the company of his preference, and that before his return he would reque&s;t a private interview with her papa and mam|ma, to make his propo&s;als in form. Thus do we overthrow the happi|ne&s;s we might enjoy, from rai&s;ing our wi&s;hes to an unattainable height: for we daily experience, that an infe|rior gratification lo&s;es all its value,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
when contra&s;ted with that on which we had fixed our hopes and expec|tations.</P>

<P>IN le&s;s than a week from this time, our hero having taken a tender and affectionate leave of Mr. and Mrs. Thom&s;on, and &s;ettled his affairs with his &s;teward, &s;et out from Warring|ton Ca&s;tle on hor&s;eback, on Monday the &mdash; of &mdash; unattended, and determined to drop his title, and be known only by the name of Mr. Warrington. His route was acro&s;s the country to Newca&s;tle, from whence he meant to proceed towards London, and there fix his future
<PB N="91" REF="92">
plans. The good Vicar, con&s;idering his youth and inexperience, would have recommended him to a friend he had in the metropolis; but he was afraid of the con&s;equences, knowing that friend (for he had but one in Lon|don), though otherwi&s;e a worthy man, to be a perfect convert to the new and ab&s;urd &s;y&s;tem of equality: it was in deed from him he had received tho&s;e books, which had perverted the mind of his beloved pupil.</P>
<P>Our hero rode &s;lowly along, medi|tating on his new ideas, and, as he beheld the labourers in the field toil|ing for the &s;upport of others, ex|claimed with the Scotti&s;h bard:
<Q><PB N="92" REF="93">
<L>Sweet were your &s;hades, Oh ye primeval groves!</L>
<L>Who&s;e boughs to man his food and &s;helter lent,</L>
<L>Pure in his plea&s;ures, happy in his loves,</L>
<L>His eye &s;till &s;miling, and his heart content.</L>
<L>Then, hand in hand, health, &s;port, and labour went,</L>
<L>Nature &s;upplied the wi&s;h &s;he taught to crave:</L>
<L>None prowl'd for prey, none watch'd to cir|cumvent,</L>
<L>To all an equal lot Heaven's bounty gave;</L>
<L>No va&s;&s;al fear'd his lord, no tyrant fear'd his &s;lave.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here he &s;topped: but he &s;hould have proceeded to the next ver&s;e, which adds,
<Q><L>&mdash; th' hi&s;toric mu&s;e has never dar'd</L>
<L>To pierce tho&s;e hallow'd bowers; 'tis fancy's beam</L>

<L>That paints the charms of that delicious theme.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">And it is too true, that though fancy has mi&s;led many, till they have lo&s;t peace as well as happine&s;s, in a thou&s;and previous in&s;tances, yet ne|ver has &s;he precipitated &s;uch numbers to utter de&s;truction, as &s;ince &s;he has aided the dreams of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy: and it is mo&s;t earne&s;tly to be hoped, that &s;hould the demon of di&s;cord di&s;gui&s;ed in, but not concealed by, the robe of liberty, fly to this happy i&s;le, every true Briton will exclaim:
<Q><L>Hence, horrible &s;hadow!</L>
<L>Unreal mockery, hence!</L></Q></P>
<P>As the evening drew to a clo&s;e, our hero arrived at a village about three parts of the way between Bel|lingham and Newca&s;tle; and, per|ceiving
<PB N="94" REF="95">
a &s;ign on which was written, 'Entertainment for man and hor&s;e,' re|&s;olved, if he could be decently accom|modated, to proceed no farther that night, being already much fatigued. As he &s;topped at the door, he was acco&s;ted by the landlord, who, like Boniface, promi&s;ed all he required; but, following him into the kitchen, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that was de|&s;tined for his reception.</P>
<P>Though general equality was his favourite topic, the idea of &s;itting down with o&s;tlers, black&s;miths, ploughmen, and &s;oldiers, by no means &s;uited his pride, of which, how|ever he endeavoured to per&s;uade him|&s;elf
<PB N="95" REF="96">
of the contrary, he had a proper &s;hare: in &s;hort,
<Q>He thought as a Sage, but he felt as a &mdash;</Q>
Baronet; and, &s;urveying the com|pany (who were &s;itting round the fire, and who made no way for him) with &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, he a&s;ked the landlord if he had no other room.</P>
<P>"Why, yes," replied the man, "I have a little bit of a parlour, to be &s;ure, but there is a gentleman in it."</P>
<P>"A gentleman!" returned our hero: "Then pray give him my compliments, and &s;ay, as a brother traveller, I &s;hould be obliged to him if he would admit
<PB N="96" REF="97">
me to partake of the comforts of his fire-&s;ide. But, after all, can you give me a bed?"</P>
<P>"Oh yes, your honour, a very good bed. To be &s;ure, young Mi&s;s has got the be&s;t; but you will have as &s;oft a one as ever you &s;lept in, if you were the bigge&s;t &s;quire in the county."</P>
<P>Our hero &s;miled. "What lady do you mean?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Why, the gentleman's &s;i&s;ter that he has ju&s;t been to fetch from boarding-&s;chool, and is going to carry her home: but the poor child is tired, and gone to bed; &s;o the gentleman is alone, and
<PB N="97" REF="98">
I dare &s;ay will be very glad of your company."</P>
<P>Here, however, his conjectures were ill-founded. The &s;tranger received the me&s;&s;age with a very ill grace, and &s;wore hand&s;omely at him for his in|tru&s;ion: but on reflection, and hav|ing a glimp&s;e of the Baronet through the window, as he went to give &s;ome orders about his hor&s;e, he con&s;ented to admit him.</P>
<P>On his entrance, our hero apolo|gized for his intru&s;ion, and the other replied: "'Pon my &s;oul, Sir, I am mo&s;t amazingly happy in your company; but, d'ye &s;ee, when the old man gave
<PB N="98" REF="99">
me the me&s;&s;age, I did not know who it might be; and, in travelling, &s;o many people a&s;&s;ume the name of gen|tlemen, who have no preten&s;ions at all, that I am va&s;tly cautious, not choo&s;ing to &s;it down among your riff raff."</P>
<P>"You are perfectly right," return|ed Sir George, rather gravely, and at a lo&s;s how to reconcile the manners of his new acquaintance with tho&s;e of a gentleman, according to his idea, though he had known but few; at length, recollecting his total igno|rance of the world, &s;uppo&s;ed the per&s;on before him to be &s;imply a real coxcomb; a tribe, of which he had only &s;een two or three humble
<PB N="99" REF="100">
imitations at the Bellingham a&s;&s;em|blies: and the dre&s;s of the &s;tranger corre&s;ponding with the idea, he was &s;atisfied with this opinion, nor did his conver&s;ation contradict it. When the &s;upper was removed, and the gen|tlemen left over their wine, our hero began a conver&s;ation on the &s;pirit of the times, and gave his own &s;enti|ments in the mo&s;t unequivocal man|ner. His companion, though he threw no new lights on the &s;ubject, coincided with him &s;o entirely, that Sir George, who in his arguments with the Vicar and the Surgeon had al|ways been oppo&s;ed, was now delight|ed; and expre&s;&s;ed his plea&s;ure &s;o frankly, that the other began to
<PB N="100" REF="101">
throw off all re&s;erve, and talk as free|ly as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Why, yes, Sir," cried he, "I think that there as you mention will be the thing at la&s;t. Oh, what lives we &s;hall lead, when we &s;hall all be on a foot! There will be jolly doings: no caning &s;ervants for getting drunk; but we &s;hall all have money in our pockets to &s;pend as we like, and nobody to call us to an account for it."</P>
<P>Sir George looked grave: the&s;e were not the advantages he hoped to reap from equality, and the other con|tinued:</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">"There was once a cu&s;tom, &s;ome|where abroad&mdash;in France was it? No no, it could not be France, becau&s;e the uppermo&s;t there were always up|permo&s;t till now: but hang me if I can hit upon the name, though 'twas but la&s;t week at dinner I heard my ma&s;ter tell it to a gentleman that &mdash;"</P>
<P>"Your ma&s;ter!" interrupted our hero much &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>His companion coloured: "A&mdash; a&mdash;, my ma&s;ter, yes my, my, old &s;chool-ma&s;ter. When I went to fetch home Charlotte, I dined with him at the &s;ame town where &s;he boarded."</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">"I beg your pardon," returned Sir George&mdash;"pray proceed."</P>
<P>"Well then," continued the other, &mdash;"&s;omewhere abroad, among the Heathens, or the Turks, or the Americans, I cannot exactly &s;ay which, where upon &s;ome great days, when they had a dinner for the Para|phernalia, they u&s;ed to make their footmen and butlers &s;it down to table, and wait upon 'em them&s;elves. But this will be for ever; &s;o, Sir, here goes Liberty and equality:" filling and drinking off a bumper as he &s;poke.</P>
<P>Our hero, though now in utter a&s;toni&s;hment, could not refu&s;e the
<PB N="103" REF="104">
toa&s;t; but he repeated it in a fainter tone than u&s;ual. Though always temperate, he was more &s;trictly &s;o &s;ince his accident, and now mixed every gla&s;s with water; &s;o that, whil&s;t perfectly compo&s;ed him&s;elf, his com|panion became as perfectly ine|briated. We all know, at &s;uch a time no man has the command of him&s;elf; and the &s;tranger fully proved it, by addre&s;&s;ing our hero, after a hearty &s;hake by the hand, in the fol|lowing manner:</P>
<P>"I'll tell you, I &s;ee you are a jolly fellow, &s;o I don't care if I tell you all, for you won't 'peach, I'm &s;ure.
<PB N="104" REF="105">
This liberty and equality is glorious work for me, my boy! A few days ago, I was footman to Squire Thorn|ton of York&s;hire, and now I'm a gentleman. My ma&s;ter was always preaching about the rights of man, and the like: &s;o I have taken the li|berty to run away with his elde&s;t daughter, and con&s;ider my&s;elf quite upon a footing with him; and, to be &s;ure, he will think the &s;ame. We are going to Gretna Green upon the wings of love; and, as &s;oon as the little black&s;mith has done his duty, I won't give way to any man in the county, let the other be who he will; for Mi&s;s Charlotte has ten thou&s;and
<PB N="105" REF="106">
pounds when &s;he comes of age, left by her grandmother. What d'ye think of my contrivance, eh?"</P>
<P>Our hero during this &s;peech felt his indignation ri&s;e to &s;uch a degree, that he could not have concealed it, had the other been in his perfect &s;en&s;es: but he was too much engro&s;&s;ed by the ideas of his future con&s;equence, to attend to the manner in which Sir George received this intelligence; who &s;truggled to &s;uppre&s;s his emo|tions, that he might form &s;ome plan to re&s;tore the lo&s;t girl to her unhappy parents; and, to do this more effectu|ally, he feigned a curio&s;ity to know how he had executed a &s;cheme which
<PB N="106" REF="107">
required no little contrivance. The other, plea&s;ed at the reque&s;t, pro|ceeded:</P>
<P>"Why, whil&s;t I was waiting at table, my ma&s;ter was always talking about one Tom Paine, who, though only a &s;taymaker, he u&s;ed to &s;ay was the fir&s;t man in the kingdom; and that, as to all the re&s;t, they were alike; he was as good as the fir&s;t Duke in the land, and had as much a right to do what he plea&s;ed, and &s;o he &s;aid had the ploughboy. Upon this thinks I, it is very hard if I may not do as I like; &s;o I took the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;peak to Mi&s;s Charlotte, who u&s;ed to walk about the Park all day long
<PB N="107" REF="108">
reading French novels: &s;o I followed her, and told her that my birth was equal to hers, and, if &s;he would but con&s;ent to marry me, I would adore her for ever; and then I u&s;ed to &s;ay I was dying for her, and if &s;he would not li&s;ten to me I &s;hould throw my&s;elf into the great pond, and that, when my father came to hear of my death, he would go di&s;tracted; for that I ran away from him to hire my&s;elf to Squire Thornton purely for her &s;ake, for that I had a very good e&s;tate in my own country. So in about a fort|night's time &s;he con&s;ented; and I got a double hor&s;e, and, when the family were a&s;leep, &s;he crept down &s;tairs and got out of the hall window; and
<PB N="108" REF="109">
we travelled acro&s;s the country all night, and about morning came to a brother of mine, who is a farmer. There we &s;topped to take &s;ome break|fa&s;t, and I got another hor&s;e, and we &s;et out again, &s;till going cro&s;s roads, that we might not be pur&s;ued, for I knew my ma&s;ter would &s;end after us when we were mi&s;&s;ed. When that hor&s;e was tired, we were pretty well &s;afe; &s;o I hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e and came here this evening, making Mi&s;s Charlotte pa&s;s for my &s;i&s;ter, ju&s;t come from &s;chool, that we may not be &s;u&s;pected. Now this being quite out of the road, I think to go to Gretna Green by round-about ways; and when we are married, I'll go
<PB N="109" REF="110">
boldly to Thornton Park, and demand her fortune."</P>
<P>"Take care," &s;aid our hero almo&s;t &s;ternly, "that you are not circumvented in the mean time." "Aye, aye," cried he, "never fear; if I do not &s;ucceed, my name is not Benjamin Potter."</P>
<P>Sir George, now finding his loqua|city increa&s;e, and that during this confu&s;ion it was impo&s;&s;ible to fix on any thing, pretended wearine&s;s, and &s;aid, as he was to pur&s;ue his journey the next morning, he meant to retire early: then wi&s;hing Mr Benjamin a good night, he left him, and, calling for the landlord, imparted the vile
<PB N="110" REF="111">
&s;tory he had ju&s;t heard, and a&s;ked his advice what mea&s;ures to pur&s;ue. The old man ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on hear|ing it, and &s;aid they could &s;end for a con&s;table to &s;ecure him; but what &s;hould they do with young Mi&s;s?</P>
<P>"Why," replied Sir George, "if you will take care of the man, and &s;ee he does not e&s;cape, I will pro|mi&s;e to convey the lady &s;afe to her father's."</P>
<P>"You will?" cried the landlord, eye|ing him earne&s;tly; "but pray who are you, and who knows whether you may not take Mr. Benjamin's place, and carry her to Gretna Green your&s;elf?
<PB N="111" REF="112">
No, no, you may go too, if you plea&s;e; but I will &s;end &s;omebody be&s;ides to &s;ee you both &s;afe."</P>
<P>Sir George, whil&s;t he could not but allow the propriety of the man's behaviour, felt him&s;elf much hurt at being the object of &s;u&s;picion: how|ever, he re&s;trained his indignation, con&s;cious that as a &s;tranger he was not to be relied upon, and, as he had evidently wi&s;hed to conceal his name, he was the more liable to cen|&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Well well," returned he impatiently, "do as you plea&s;e; only &s;ecure the vil|lain, and do not, at lea&s;t till the morn|ing,
<PB N="112" REF="113">
let the poor girl know any thing of the matter."</P>
<P>The landlord promi&s;ed a&s;&s;ent, and left the hou&s;e in&s;tantly. He was an hone&s;t and worthy character, who had long lived in a gentleman's family as butler; but, when he married, left his place to &s;et up in this little inn. He had therefore &s;een too much of the world to tru&s;t appearances; and the extreme anxiety of Sir George to &s;ave the young lady from ruin did not &s;eem to him &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted as it really was; and he was deter|mined to &s;end a per&s;on on whom he could depend, to return her &s;afe to her father. The con&s;tables &s;oon ar|rived;
<PB N="113" REF="114">
and, on the te&s;timony of the Baronet, Mr. Benjamin was commit|ted, and lodged in a &s;ecure place, till he could be &s;ent to the county gaol; and all this was executed with &s;o little noi&s;e, that Mi&s;s Charlotte awoke not from the heavy &s;leep into which fa|tigue had thrown her; though he be|&s;towed the bittere&s;t cur&s;es on the ra&s;|cal who he &s;aid had betrayed him: but this made no impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of any pre&s;ent. Sir George liberally rewarded the men who &s;eized him, and promi&s;ed them a farther gratuity, if in all points they did their duty; and this was a &s;till &s;tronger motive for them to behave as they ought. When all was quiet he retired to his own room,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
and went to re&s;t with that innate &s;a|tisfaction which ever ari&s;es from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having performed a good action.</P>

<P>"AND it is villains like the&s;e," cried Sir George mentally, as he aro&s;e in the morning, "who di&s;grace a cau&s;e that is &s;o noble in it&s;elf!" Alas! he was yet to learn, that, among the ma|ny who adopted his favourite &s;y&s;tem, there were but few who, like him&s;elf, thought only of the general good that might &s;pring from it; as far the greater part of its adherents enter|tained no hopes, but of ri&s;ing them|&s;elves by the de&s;truction of others. Like the fox in the fable, they en|tice
<PB N="116" REF="117">
the goat into the pit, to e&s;cape from it them&s;elves by her means.</P>
<P>On going down &s;tairs, he walked through the kitchen into the parlour he had quitted the night before, where, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, he was acco&s;ted by one of his tenants, who was re|turning from Newca&s;tle; and the man addre&s;&s;ing him by his title, and ex|pre&s;&s;ing that plea&s;ure at meeting him which tho&s;e who knew him ever felt, the landlord apologized to his honour for his rough behaviour the evening before, and declared he &s;hould think the young lady perfectly &s;afe under his protection, having long known the character of Sir George Warrington,
<PB N="117" REF="118">
though till now unacquainted with his per&s;on. The Baronet accepted his apologies with his u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s; and, having returned his tenant's ad|dre&s;s with the &s;ame cordiality, went into the room where breakfa&s;t was prepared, and de&s;ired Mi&s;s Thornton might be called, intending to di&s;clo&s;e to her, with all po&s;&s;ible gentlene&s;s, the events of the preceding night. But this trouble was &s;pared him by the officious kindne&s;s of the landlady; who, unable any longer to conceal it in her own bo&s;om, had informed the poor girl of the whole, a few minutes before, and &s;he was then in a violent hy&s;teric fit. This made no &s;mall de|gree of confu&s;ion in the hou&s;e: but
<PB N="118" REF="119">
the u&s;ual remedies being applied, the di&s;order &s;oon gave way; and, with her eyes &s;till inflamed with weeping, Mi&s;s Charlotte entered the room. Sir George addre&s;&s;ed her with the utmo&s;t mildne&s;s, and reque&s;ted her not to grieve at an event, for which at &s;ome future time &s;he would have rea&s;on to rejoice.</P>
<P>"Con&s;ider, dear Madam," he con|tinued, "what would have been your feelings, had you married this wretch. Di&s;owned by your own family, de&s;pi&s;ed by your former acquaintance, and re|garded with contemptuous pity by tho&s;e who are now your inferiors, how would you have borne all the&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="120">
evils, added to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that you had drawn them upon your&s;elf, by giving your hand to a common &s;ervant?"</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, Sir," returned the young lady angrily; "he was no &s;ervant; he only wore a livery to gain admittance to my pre&s;ence; nor is it the fir&s;t time by many, as I have often heard and read, of gentlemen going in di&s;gui&s;e to obtain the fir&s;t wi&s;h of their hearts. I &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, you think his name was Benjamin Potter: no, Sir; it is Augu&s;tus Clinton; the other was only a&s;&s;umed to carry on his purpo&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">"Say rather, Madam, the latter was a&s;&s;umed to carry on his purpo&s;e: indeed I am too well a&s;&s;ured of it. In this very room, la&s;t night, he confe&s;&s;|ed the whole plan to me; un&s;olicited on my part, he owned the deception practi&s;ed on you, and the motives that led him to it. Reflect a mo|ment, Mi&s;s Charlotte; u&s;e the good &s;en&s;e you undoubtedly po&s;&s;e&s;s; and you mu&s;t know, had he been really a man of independent fortune, he would have applied to your father; and, when I accu&s;ed him of duplicity and impo&s;ture, would have cleared him|&s;elf from the charge, had it been po&s;&s;ible, and at once acknowledged him&s;elf a gentleman. And &s;uffer me to
<PB N="121" REF="122">
add, had he proved this clearly, how|ever I might be concerned at your clande&s;tine proceedings, I &s;hould not have thought my&s;elf ju&s;tified in pre|venting your journey."</P>
<P>Conviction now fla&s;hed upon Mi&s;s Thornton, though yet too proud to confe&s;s it; and her tears flowed rapid|ly. Indeed the fear of returning to her family in &s;ome degree occa&s;ioned them. Our hero &s;oothed her with every expre&s;&s;ion of benevolence, and promi&s;ed to intercede with her father for that forgivene&s;s, which, as her deliverer, he had a right to claim. A little comforted by the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, &s;he got into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, when it
<PB N="122" REF="123">
drove up to the door, with more com|po&s;ure than Sir George expected.</P>
<P>During their journey he had an opportunity of developing her cha|racter, which was to a degree roman|tic and &s;entimental, and of learning that her education had been &s;uch as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to excu&s;e her con|duct. He &s;ound from her conver&s;a|tion, that her mother was a gay wo|man, who &s;pent more than half the year in London, where &s;he entered into every kind of di&s;&s;ipation; that during the&s;e periods &s;he was left in the country with her &s;i&s;ters, who were all younger than her&s;elf, and a French governe&s;s; and that their only
<PB N="123" REF="124">
amu&s;ement was reading novels, as they had no neighbourhood in the winter; and in the &s;ummer, when their own family were a&s;&s;embled, and they entered into all the &s;ociety the country afforded, &s;he was &s;till confined with her governe&s;s whenever they had com|pany; as, though near &s;ixteen, her mother thought her too young to be brought into the world. Having formed her mind upon the principles &s;he had met with in her &s;tudies, &s;he had for &s;everal months expected &s;ome adventure would befall her, and of cour&s;e was neither &s;urpri&s;ed nor angry when Benjamin Potter announced him&s;elf as her de&s;pairing lover, Au|gu&s;tus Clinton; a name too con&s;onant
<PB N="124" REF="125">
to her ideas not to have the de&s;ired effect. The con&s;equences were &s;uch as might be expected; and Mi&s;s Char|lotte was indebted to her good genius for counteracting her intentions.</P>
<P>By the time they drew near Thorn|ton Park, the young lady was quite reconciled to her cruel per&s;ecutor, as &s;he termed Sir George: but that ap|pellation was now changed into her amiable deliverer; nor would he have found it very difficult to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the &s;ame place in her af|fections Mr. Benjamin had previ|ou&s;ly filled: but he was perfectly un|ambitious, and &s;ought no recompen&s;e but the applau&s;es of his own con|&s;cience.
<PB N="125" REF="126">
When the park gates opened for their reception, Mi&s;s Thornton's apprehen&s;ions increa&s;ed &s;o much, that our hero, mindful of his promi&s;e, bade the po&s;tillion &s;top; and, alighting, walked on towards the hou&s;e. On en|quiring for Mr. Thornton, he was &s;hewn into a parlour where that gen|tleman was &s;itting. After &s;ome little preparation, he opened his commi&s;&s;ion, and by degrees informed him his un|happy daughter was, with deep contri|tion, waiting his forgivene&s;s, in the park, too timid to proceed till a&s;&s;ured of a favourable reception.</P>
<P>Mr. Thornton, whatever gratitude he might feel, a&s;&s;uredly did not at this
<PB N="126" REF="127">
time expre&s;s any to the protector of his child; but received his intelligence with rage and execrations: but when the&s;e had exhau&s;ted them&s;elves, he recollected the impropriety of his be|haviour, and apologized for it. Sir George coldly an&s;wered, "he was &s;orry to &s;ee him &s;o ill di&s;po&s;ed to grant that forgivene&s;s, which the youth and in-experience of his daughter (he might have added, her improper mode of education) gave her a claim to, and that he was the more concerned, as he had, to induce her return, promi&s;ed his influence to &s;ecure her pardon."</P>
<P>Mr. Thornton replied, "he could have forgiven her any thing but run|ning
<PB N="127" REF="128">
away with a footman. Had he been but a gentleman," continued he, "and had not a coat to his back, nor a &s;hilling in his pocket, I &s;hould not re&s;ent it thus; but a &s;ervant, my own &s;ervant too&mdash;"</P>
<P>Sir George interrupted him: "Then, Sir, I will exculpate the young lady; the man impo&s;ed on her by an artful tale, and led her to believe he was a gentleman; and, as I learnt from her|&s;elf, her having &s;een little of &s;ociety induced her the more readily to credit him, as &s;he had not the power of di&s;|tingui&s;hing that his manners contra|dicted his a&s;&s;ertions."</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="129">Mr. Thornton's rage again ro&s;e to its fir&s;t height; but Mr. Benjamin Potter was now the object. When he once more grew cool, our hero continued:</P>
<P>"Yet he was not totally to blame; he heard you &s;o frequently declare, that all men were upon an equality, that he determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to rai&s;e him&s;elf to your level, by an union with your daughter: therefore&mdash;"</P>
<P>Sir George would have gone on: but, a third time, the fury of Mr. Thornton vented it&s;elf in &s;uch oaths and imprecations again&s;t levellers, and all &s;upporters of a cau&s;e he had be|fore
<PB N="129" REF="130">
as vehemently ju&s;tified and ap|proved, that our hero was ri&s;ing to quit the room; when a me&s;&s;age from Mrs. Thornton &s;ummoned him into another parlour. This lady, who had heard a confu&s;ed account from the &s;ervants of the cau&s;e of his vi&s;it, now begged to know the truth with much earne&s;tne&s;s. Though half afraid of exciting her wrath al&s;o, he inform|ed her of the whole, and claimed her pardon for her unhappy child. With|out altering a mu&s;cle of her counte|nance, &s;he granted it in the fulle&s;t manner: and our hero, delighted at &s;ucceeding with one of the family, ro&s;e up to acquaint his young charge; but Mrs. Thornton, ringing the bell,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
&s;aid "&s;he would &s;ave him the trouble," and ordered her own woman to go to the carriage, and acquaint Mi&s;s Char|lotte that &s;he would be received. In le&s;s than a minute the poor girl &s;prang into the room, and, falling at her mo|ther's feet, bur&s;t into an agony of tears. She very compo&s;edly bid her ri&s;e; and then calling Wilkins, com|manded her to take Mi&s;s Charlotte into the back garret, and lock her up, with a &s;lice of bread and a cup of water for her &s;upper; adding with a &s;neer, "that before &s;he had been Mrs. Potter three months, &s;uch fare would have been a luxury to her."</P>
<P>The unhappy Charlotte obeyed
<PB N="131" REF="132">
this &s;tern order without a murmur; but through her fa&s;t falling tears turned her really beautiful eyes with an imploring look towards our hero, who was in&s;en&s;ible to all her attrac|tions, yet too much intere&s;ted in her cau&s;e not to dete&s;t the coldne&s;s and even hardne&s;s of her mother. When &s;he had quitted the room, the lady enquired farther particulars, return|ed with the mo&s;t &s;tudied politene&s;s her thanks to the Baronet for his for|tunate interpo&s;ition, and then reque&s;ted to know to whom they were &s;o much obliged. He informed her without re&s;erve; and her re&s;pect and civility increa&s;ed with the certainty that his rank at lea&s;t de&s;erved it. At her
<PB N="132" REF="133">
earne&s;t entreaties, he con&s;ented to &s;tay till the next day; but more from a hope of mediating in Mi&s;s Thornton's favour, than experiencing any plea&s;ure from conver&s;ing with a family, who&s;e minds he already &s;aw would not a&s;&s;i|milate with his own.</P>

<P>FROM what has been already re|lated the reader mu&s;t di&s;cover, that Mr. and Mrs. Thornton were of very oppo|&s;ite characters. The former in fact was violent even to fury, but generous and forgiving; the latter, cold-hearted and re&s;entful, but always calm. When &s;upper was announced, the gentle|man entered the room; and, his rage being now entirely at an end, he went up to our hero, and, with all that warmth &s;o natural to him, pre&s;&s;ed his hand, apologized for his pa&s;t conduct, a&s;&s;ured him how deeply he felt the
<PB N="134" REF="135">
obligation, and begged to know how he could return it.</P>
<P>Sir George an&s;wered, "he wi&s;hed for no return, but a frank and entire pardon for the young lady, on who&s;e future behaviour he thought they might rely."</P>
<P>"Forgive her!" cried he: "Aye, to be &s;ure; I have been enquiring for her, and expected to &s;ee her here. Why does &s;he not come to &s;upper?"</P>
<P>"She is &s;upping upon bread and water in the garret," an&s;wered Mrs. Thornton, "and that is too good for her."</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">Mr. Thornton's lips again quivered: he turned pale with anger; but, com|manding him&s;elf, only &s;aid, "I in&s;i&s;t on her being brought down in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>"If you can open the door, you may," cried the lady tartly.</P>
<P>"If the key cannot be found, I will break it down," &s;aid the gen|tleman.</P>
<P>This altercation la&s;ted for &s;ome time, till the object of it made her ap|pearance, when &s;he was mo&s;t unrea|&s;onably care&s;&s;ed by her father, in en|tire oppo&s;ition to the mother. Our hero, though rejoiced at having gained
<PB N="136" REF="137">
his point by her reception, was con|cerned that the oppo&s;ite and equally blamable conduct of her father and mother would probably prevent her reformation. The con&s;equence of the father's kindne&s;s was, that &s;he ap|peared to forget her own imprudence, and to hate her mother, who&s;e con|temptuous treatment in &s;ome degree ju&s;tified the poor girl's di&s;like, though it could not excu&s;e her behaviour. Sir George was extremely rejoiced when it was time to retire, and re&s;ol|ved to leave Thornton Park after breakfa&s;t the following morning. Some conver&s;ation on politics had taken place; but our hero, finding Mr. Thornton was now as furious on one
<PB N="137" REF="138">
&s;ide, as he had formerly been on the other, purpo&s;ely changed the &s;ubject, re&s;olving not to be influenced by a man who had no fixed principles, but who veered according as his intere&s;t or pa&s;&s;ions were affected.</P>
<P>Early the next day he left his cham|ber; but, finding the parlour not yet ready for the reception of the family, he was going to take a &s;troll in the park, when the footman, throwing open the door of another apartment, a&s;ked him to walk in, &s;aying it was the room belonging to Mademoi&s;elle and the young ladies; but they were now walking. Curio&s;ity tempted him to enter; and he immediately began exa|mining
<PB N="138" REF="139">
the &s;ide of the room occupied by the &s;helves for their books; and here he found &s;till more rea&s;on to ex|cu&s;e Mi&s;s Charlotte. There had been a large collection; but the greater part were &s;oiled and torn. Rou&s;&s;eau's Elo|i&s;e, and &s;everal other French novels of the wor&s;t tendency, and &s;ome Eng|li&s;h ones, appeared to have been much read; whil&s;t Telemachus, the Specta|tor, Madame Genlis's works, Advice to a Daughter, Mrs. Chapone's Let|ters, with many others of the &s;ame kind, &s;eemed perfectly new, but were covered with du&s;t; and in &s;ome places even cobwebs proved they had not been removed from their &s;ituations for many months.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">Whil&s;t he was thus employed, the young people, attended by their go|verne&s;s, returned from their morning's ramble. They were all fine girls, but received his addre&s;s with &s;uch an air of awkward &s;hyne&s;s, that he could not but lament where nature had done &s;o much, parental care &s;hould do &s;o little. Mademoi&s;elle was much more ea&s;y and di&s;engaged, and, with all the vivacity natural to her nation, entered into conver&s;ation with him: but a &s;um|mons to breakfa&s;t put a &s;top to it; &s;oon after which he ordered his hor&s;e, which had accompanied the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and took a cold but polite leave of Mr. and Mrs. Thornton; re|commending to the former to &s;hew
<PB N="140" REF="141">
&s;ome lenity in his pro&s;ecution of Ben|jamin Potter, and gently hinting to the latter, that the mo&s;t probable method of &s;ecuring Mi&s;s Charlotte's future obedience was to &s;hew her a little more of the world, that &s;he might di&s;tingui&s;h between people of real merit and pretenders to it, and al&s;o teach her to &s;et a ju&s;ter, if not a higher, value on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As Thornton Park was &s;ituated in the ea&s;t riding of York&s;hire, and not very di&s;tant from the coa&s;t, our hero was many miles from the great northern road, which he &s;ought to regain, but in a direction that would not lengthen his journey. The evening therefore
<PB N="141" REF="142">
drew to a clo&s;e before he reached it, and he was again compelled to &s;pend the night in a village inn. But this was no great hard&s;hip to a leveller; one who from principle, romantic it is true, but yet benevolent, wi&s;hed to &s;ee all mankind on an equality. He &s;oon found him&s;elf comfortably ac|commodated in a &s;mall parlour, with a good fire and a di&s;h of tea; and he was &s;carcely &s;eated, when the wind ri&s;ing almo&s;t to a &s;torm, and the rain fall|ing in torrents, made him &s;ecretly rejoice that he had gone no farther.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was ruminating on the events of his journey, and reflecting that, if no good accrued to him&s;elf, he
<PB N="142" REF="143">
&s;hould at lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction of knowing he had been the means of perhaps &s;aving an innocent girl from de&s;truction, his attention was attracted by the &s;ound of wheels; and, going to the window, he &s;aw a car|riage &s;top, and a young lady alight from it, who at the fir&s;t view &s;truck him as the mo&s;t beautiful object he had ever beheld. She appeared about nineteen, was dre&s;&s;ed in a black ri|ding habit, and a beaver hat of the &s;ame colour. Her hair, which was light brown, hung on her neck, as if di&s;hevelled by her journey, and her face pre&s;ented &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of attractions, as made an in&s;tant impre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="143" REF="144">
on his heart. To &s;ay he lo&s;t it wholly at this glance, would be an ab&s;urdity. In a mind well cultivated and well regulated, love at fir&s;t &s;ight is a doctrine always reprobated; but truth obliges me to confe&s;s, he expe|rienced more unea&s;ine&s;s from the mo|ment her bright blue eyes darted ac|cidentally upon him, than he had ever felt from the repeated and intended attacks of Mi&s;s Kettering's &s;parklers.</P>
<P>The beautiful &s;tranger now entered the hou&s;e; and the po&s;tillion, having taken out a &s;mall trunk, delivered it to the landlady; and then, having re|ceived the money due to him, he turned his hor&s;es' heads, and &s;et out
<PB N="144" REF="145">
immediately. Sir George could not re&s;i&s;t the curio&s;ity he felt to &s;ee more of this young lady; and going back to his &s;eat, the door, which happened to be a-jar, favoured his wi&s;hes. She was &s;tanding in the kitchen, with evi|dent marks of anxiety on her counte|nance, awaiting the landlady's return, who had run up &s;tairs to fetch her a better chair than the room afforded. When &s;he came down, in&s;tead of availing her&s;elf of her civility, &s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed her in the following manner: "Pray, can you tell me how far it is from hence to farmer Garland's?" "A little better than a mile, Madam," &s;aid the woman.&mdash;"Will you then &s;end &s;omebody to inform the farmer a lady
<PB N="145" REF="146">

"Dead!" repeated the &s;tranger: "Heaven forbid!"&mdash;"Aye, Madam, he caught the ague and fever going to his wife's funeral, about a month before: &s;o now&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here &s;he was interrupted by a low &s;cream, but one expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, from the fair un|known; who caught hold of her arm, and, with a wild agony that terrified her, exclaimed, "Tell me once more, are they indeed both dead? Oh would to

heaven the &s;ame&mdash;" Here her feelings over powered her, and &s;he &s;unk into the chair in a &s;tate of utter in&s;en&s;ibi|lity. Our hero now ru&s;hed out, and, lifting her in his arms, brought her from the gaze of the vulgar multi|tude, who &s;urrounded her with all the apathy of unfeeling curio&s;ity, into the room he had occupied, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the landlady in rubbing her temples and hands with vinegar&mdash;the only re|medy the hou&s;e afforded. This, how|ever, proved efficacious: for in a few minutes &s;he opened her beautiful eyes, and, turning them on our hero, at|tempted to expre&s;s her thanks for his attention; but her voice failed her, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. This gave her
<PB N="147" REF="148">
a more permanent relief; and, when &s;he was compo&s;ed enough to li&s;ten to him, he a&s;ked if it was in his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>With a deep &s;igh, that appeared al|mo&s;t the la&s;t effort of a heart breaking with repeated misfortunes, &s;he replied: "There is now no human being on whom I have a claim; but the Pro|tector of innocence will not, I hope, de&s;ert me in this hour of di&s;tre&s;s. Your advice, Sir, may perhaps guide me: beyond that, my youth, my &s;itua|tion, and unprotected &s;tate, forbid me to accept."</P>
<P>Sir George put his hand to his brea&s;t, and an&s;wered, with a frankne&s;s

<P>She looked up with more confi|dence at this a&s;&s;urance, and again thanked him: and being now almo&s;t recovered, he led her to the table; and, giving her a di&s;h of tea, &s;he &s;oon became &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to enter into the particulars of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and the rea&s;ons why the death of far|mer

<P>"I am at this moment," &s;aid &s;he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing our hero, "&s;o utterly unable to decide for my&s;elf, &s;o di&s;tracted by my pa&s;t &s;ufferings and immediate di&s;ap|pointments, that I cannot refu&s;e your polite and benevolent reque&s;t, though I know not but I am guilty of a great impropriety in thus&mdash;" Her tears again checked her utterance, and it was &s;ome minutes before &s;he could proceed: at length &s;he continued:</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Sir, for troubling you with a relation of my misfortunes; but my &s;tory, though melancholy, is
<PB N="150" REF="151">
neither long nor eventful. My fa|ther, who&s;e name was Moreland, had a large e&s;tate in this neighbourhood; but, a law-&s;uit commencing again&s;t him, he lo&s;t it all with arrears when I was ju&s;t eight years old. My mother died before my remembrance. I was his only child; and the little remain|der of his fortune being in&s;ufficient to &s;upport him in his native country, he re&s;olved to retire with me to a town in the &s;outh of France. Soon after our arrival, he placed me in a convent for education, where I remained till the hand of death tore him from me. He was my only friend, my only reli|ance in this world; and, when he was
<PB N="151" REF="152">
taken from me, I felt I was alone in the univer&s;e. My religion (for I had early received the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions in favour of the prote&s;tant faith, which had been confirmed by an old lady whom I frequently vi&s;ited during my &s;tay at the Convent) forbade my taking the vows&mdash;a plan which I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have gladly embraced, as an a&s;ylum from mi&s;ery: and I knew not where to go, when the Abbe&s;s, who, though an excellent woman, was no bi|got, offered to receive me as a con&s;tant boarder at a very moderate &s;alary. In|deed a moderate &s;alary was all I could afford to pay. My father, who&s;e little income cea&s;ed at his death, had &s;aved annually from it a trifle, which he placed
<PB N="152" REF="153">
in the French funds, and &s;uffered to ac|cumulate for my u&s;e. This was my &s;ole dependance, and even this little I was prevented from receiving by the di&s;|tracted &s;tate of the French nation. But the good Abbe&s;s St. Cecile (and a &s;aint &s;he was, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, if the &s;tricte&s;t piety, the pure&s;t faith, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive charity, can con&s;titute that character) declared &s;he would never for&s;ake me. I had no friend, and &s;carcely an acquaintance, beyond the Convent walls: the old Engli&s;h lady died before my father; and his retired way of life &s;ecluded him from all &s;ociety: indeed di&s;ap|pointment had &s;o &s;ickened him of the world, he had little inclination to &s;eek
<PB N="153" REF="154">
it, and he was too poor to be &s;ought by it. Thus were my hopes, and al|mo&s;t my wi&s;hes, bounded by one nar|row circle: but even that little &s;pot was torn from me. An order for the de&s;truction of the convent came down from Paris. Let me not dwell on that day: its horrors were too much for memory: the old, the &s;ickly, the infirm, wandering for &s;upport they could not obtain; the young &s;ubjected to every in&s;ult the brutality of the multitude cho&s;e to inflict. I was al|mo&s;t without money, and totally with|out friends, except among my fellow &s;ufferers: but a few of the younger nuns, intending to e&s;cape to England, offered to take me with them, as they
<PB N="154" REF="155">
knew I might here meet with protec|tion from a woman who had been my nur&s;e, and with whom I had con|&s;tantly corre&s;ponded till within a few months, when receiving and &s;ending letters became hazardous, if not dan|gerous. Delighted with this pro&s;pect, I ha&s;tened to St. Cecile, to inform her of it; but gue&s;s my emotion, when I was told &s;he had quitted her lodgings, and the people of the hou&s;e could give me no intelligence of her! Di&s;tracted with my fears, I ran wildly about the town; when I accidentally learnt that an old nun had taken refuge in a mi&s;erable hovel without the walls. To this place I directed my &s;teps, and found her; but in what a &s;ituation!&mdash;
<PB N="155" REF="156">
&s;tretched on a bed of &s;traw, and al|mo&s;t dying, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance and without nouri&s;hment. She told me, 'the woman with whom &s;he had lodged, di&s;covering her poverty, had the night before turned her into the &s;treet; and that this &s;hock, added to her previous &s;ufferings, had deprived her of the u&s;e of her limbs; and &s;he now lay expo&s;ed to all the horrors of &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow.' Could I have quitted her in this &s;ituation&mdash;her who had been more than a mother to me; who had afforded me a refuge when in the wide world I had no other re&s;ource&mdash;I mu&s;t have been a brute. I concealed the offer I had met with; and, under pre|tence of &s;eeking for her &s;ome relief,
<PB N="156" REF="157">
left the cottage, with a heart torn by a variety of di&s;tracting emotions, and &s;ought my friends. I informed them of the &s;ituation of the Abbe&s;s, and implored them to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; adding, that whil&s;t &s;he remained in that me|lancholy &s;tate I would never leave her. They gave me a trifle for pre|&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but declared the im|po&s;&s;ibility of their waiting for me, as the period of her life was uncer|tain. I could make no reply to this: but their going without paying her one farewell vi&s;it &s;hocked my feel|ings; for &s;he had been an univer&s;al friend to the whole community, and as &s;uch I thought &s;he was univer|&s;ally beloved: and this gave me the
<PB N="157" REF="158">
fir&s;t &s;ad proof, that &s;elf-intere&s;t too often overcomes every principle of gratitude and every &s;entiment of humanity. Some of them deigned not even to make an apology for their conduct; whil&s;t the others de|clared 'they &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o much in an interview, that they could not at|tempt it.' Di&s;gu&s;ted with them, I returned to St. Cecile, with &s;ome pro|vi&s;ions I had purcha&s;ed with their bounty: but it did not la&s;t long; and I was then reduced to &s;olicit pre|carious and accidental charity. I had, however, the &s;atisfaction of knowing my exertions were not thrown away: the Abbe&s;s, though every day weaker, was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of

my attentions, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I could not but perceive I &s;oftened the clo&s;e of her melancholy exi&s;tence; and this reflec|tion gave me the highe&s;t gratification. She lingered three weeks, and then without a &s;igh re&s;igned her pure &s;oul to its Creator. Only one circum&s;tance during this period &s;eemed to le&s;&s;en the cheerful re&s;ignation with which &s;he bore up again&s;t di&s;ea&s;e and poverty: this was the idea of dying without a Confe&s;&s;or, and without tho&s;e ceremo|nies which the more rigid of the Catholic Church deem almo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential to &s;alvation. But the prie&s;ts were all fled to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in this happy country: and I u&s;ed my weak endeavours to con&s;ole her, and with
<PB N="159" REF="160">
&s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. Perhaps, though a Pro|te&s;tant, I was better able to calm her mind than one of her own re|ligion; &s;ince, according to my faith, I could, without acting again&s;t con&s;ci|ence, a&s;&s;ure her, that that Being who&s;e mercy equals his ju&s;tice would ac|cept the pious yet humble effu&s;ions of her &s;oul, though only offered by her own lips. But I have before &s;aid St. Cecile was no bigot.</P>
<P>"When my maternal, my revered friend was laid in that grave, to which I could joyfully have follow|ed her, I began to turn my thoughts to my own &s;ituation; but could fix on nothing that afforded me a
<PB N="160" REF="161">
pro&s;pect of &s;upport: my own little pittance had been long &s;ince exhau&s;t|ed, and I had now no means of reach|ing England. I rambled into the country to a&s;&s;i&s;t the pea&s;ants in their labours; but the vineyards were de|&s;troyed, the villages depopulated, and there was not &s;ufficient employment for the few who remained. Hungry and hopele&s;s, I returned to the town, and, pa&s;&s;ing the principal inn, I &s;aw an Engli&s;h carriage: hope again took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart. I enquired for the owners; and was &s;hewn into a room where &s;at an elderly lady and a young man, whom I &s;hould have con&s;idered as mother and &s;on, but from their conver&s;ation &s;oon learnt

otherwi&s;e. I began my melancholy tale; but was checked by the lady, who &s;aid &s;he had met with impo&s;tors enough of her own country already, and could relieve no more: then throwing me a crown, &s;he bade me leave the room. I curt&s;eyed my grateful thanks, and obeyed her: though in the countenance of my countryman I read a degree of com|pa&s;&s;ion that might have induced me to per&s;i&s;t, but for the fear of ex|citing her anger. Nor was I de|ceived: as I walked &s;lowly to the cottage where I had remained from the death of St. Cecile, I was over|taken by his &s;ervant, who, in a lan|guage ever grateful to my ears,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
though I had been long a &s;tranger to it, told me his ma&s;ter had &s;ent me five guineas; but that, if I met them on the road, I mu&s;t not expre&s;s my thanks, le&s;t his lady &s;hould know it, as &s;he was the mo&s;t jealous of hu|man beings. I promi&s;ed acquie&s;cence; but joy &s;o entirely overcame me, I bur&s;t into tears. The man was af|fected; his hone&s;t Engli&s;h heart ex|panded with charity; and, putting his hand into his pocket, he drew out a guinea and held it to me; but I was already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fortune, and refu&s;ed it. He then enquired how he could a&s;&s;i&s;t me. I replied, my only wi&s;h was to reach England, where I had friends who could receive me,
<PB N="163" REF="164">
though too poor them&s;elves to &s;end me the means of travelling; but that the bounty of his ma&s;ter would do much towards the accompli&s;hment of my plans. He pau&s;ed a moment; and then &s;aid that him&s;elf and his la|dy's woman were to follow their ma&s;ter and lady to Montreuil, where they &s;hould remain &s;ome weeks; but that &s;o far he could contrive to con|vey me, if I would &s;ubmit to &s;ome inconveniencies. To this I joyfully a&s;&s;ented; and, bidding me &s;tay where I was till his return, he left me in ha&s;te. How tedious were the&s;e mo|ments! At length he appeared; and, telling me he had &s;ettled every thing with Mrs. Clerke, bade me follow

him. I was then introduced to this good young woman, who, with a de|gree of kindne&s;s I could not expect from a &s;tranger, told me, 'as far as &s;he was to go I &s;hould &s;hare her com|forts, if I could but be concealed from her lady, who&s;e unhappy di&s;|po&s;ition would not approve of &s;uch an addition to their &s;uite.'</P>
<P>"Not to dwell longer on this part of my narrative, we &s;et out; and ar|rived at Montreuil in &s;afety, and un|di&s;covered either by Mr. or Mrs. Saxby. There my good friend James hired me a lodging, where I was to remain till their departure, unle&s;s I could meet with an equally eligible

We &s;oon &s;ettled the plan of our jour|ney; and, taking an affectionate leave of my kind and charitable friends, James Bever and Lucy Clerke, and giving them my direction to this place, I quitted Montreuil with the&s;e ladies, and reached London without any accident.

<P>LOUISA Moreland here con|cluded her melancholy narrative, and then gave vent to her tears. Some parts of it had almo&s;t unmanned our hero; who, though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a brave &s;oul, was not a&s;hamed of hav|ing a feeling heart. He pau&s;ed a few minutes; and then, his counte|nance beaming with hope, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed the fair fugitive in the follow|ing manner:</P>
<P>"I flatter my&s;elf, Mi&s;s Moreland,
<PB N="168" REF="169">
I have thought of a &s;cheme which may le&s;&s;en, if not obviate, your mi&s;|fortunes, without involving me in any &s;u&s;picion of being bia&s;&s;ed by other motives than tho&s;e the pure&s;t virtue, the mo&s;t unfullied honour, might dic|tate. In the village of Warrington in Northumberband, near which I own I re&s;ide, but I at pre&s;ent intend going abroad to remain perhaps for many months, lives a Mr. Thom&s;on, the Vicar of the place, and his wife a mo&s;t amiable woman. With them, if you will conde&s;cend to be the bearer of a letter from me, you may re&s;ide with comfort, if not with hap|pine&s;s, till you can fix on a more eli|gible &s;cheme. Your &s;ociety will give
<PB N="169" REF="170">
them plea&s;ure, and you may there enjoy that peace which has been &s;o long a &s;tranger to your bo&s;om."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Moreland bowed her thanks: &s;he could not immediately expre&s;s the gratitude &s;he felt; and he conti|nued&mdash;</P>
<P>"It may not, perhaps, be a di&s;|agreeable circum&s;tance to you, that you may have an opportunity of again &s;eeing your re&s;pectable though humble friends, James and Lucy; as, from your de&s;cription, I imagine Mrs. Saxby mu&s;t be a lady I once knew by the name of Barclay, who, I was told &s;ome little time &s;ince, was married to a Mr. Saxby, a gentleman
<PB N="170" REF="171">
very much her inferior both in point of age and fortune: and that they were &s;oon coming to England to re|&s;ide at Barclay Manor, which is only &s;even miles from Warrington Ca&s;|tle."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a now returned her warme&s;t acknowledgments for the intere&s;t he took in her friendle&s;s &s;ituation, and joyfully accepted an offer, which, in the ardency of youthful hope, &s;eem|ed to promi&s;e a termination to her ca|lamities; as &s;he flattered her&s;elf, if Mrs. Thom&s;on was the amiable being Sir George had de&s;cribed, &s;he would contrive &s;ome plan for her future e&s;tabli&s;hment, and perhaps even re|commend her to &s;ome family as a
<PB N="171" REF="172">
governe&s;s; for which &s;ituation &s;he was particularly well qualified, by her perfect knowledge of French, drawing, and fine works: and this hope &s;oothed her tortured mind into &s;uch compo&s;ure, that, when &s;he re|tired to re&s;t, &s;he enjoyed for &s;ome hours a quiet and undi&s;turbed &s;lum|ber. Our hero, the moment he was alone, called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote the following letter to Mr. Thom&s;on:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the knowledge of your univer&s;al benevolence, I &s;hall make no apology for the trouble I am go|ing to give you and Mrs. Thom&s;on,
<PB N="172" REF="173">
con&s;cious I cannot afford you a higher gratification than an opportunity of doing good. The bearer of this let|ter is a young lady who&s;e name is Loui&s;a Moreland, and who&s;e mi&s;|fortunes have been &s;uch as to entitle her to every con&s;olation humanity can be&s;tow. Her &s;tory is &s;hort and melancholy: her father lo&s;t his e&s;tate by a law-&s;uit in her infancy, and then taking her abroad educated her in a convent in the &s;outh of France, where but for the difference of re|ligion &s;he would on his death have taken the veil. Soon after this, the de&s;truction of the convent, where &s;he remained as a boarder, compelled her to &s;eek another a&s;ylum; and &s;he
<PB N="173" REF="174">
came as far as Montreuil with the &s;er|vants of your neighbour Mrs. Sax|by, but, I believe, without the know|ledge either of her or her hu&s;band. At that place &s;he had the good fortune to meet two fugitive nuns, whom &s;he accompanied to England. They parted in London; and Mi&s;s More|land &s;et out for this place, expecting to re&s;ide with her old nur&s;e, who was married to a farmer in the neighbour|hood. Judge then of her horror and grief, on finding this woman and her hu&s;band were both dead, and that in her native country &s;he was alone, friendle&s;s and unprotected. For|tunately I witne&s;&s;ed her &s;ufferings, and have it in my power to remove
<PB N="174" REF="175">
them by recommending her to your care. She is too young and too beautiful to owe an obligation to a man of my age, without incurring &s;u&s;picions fatal to her reputation, and of cour&s;e her repo&s;e; but through your means I may &s;afely offer her a pre&s;ent &s;upport, as I tru&s;t you know me too well to imagine I have any wi&s;h but for her happine&s;s. There|fore, my re&s;pected friend, let Mrs. Thom&s;on procure for her every ac|commodation in her power; an&s;wer every demand &s;he may make; oblige her with any &s;um of money, which I promi&s;e to repay: and give her, for a time at lea&s;t, an a&s;ylum under your own roof, where &s;he will be
<PB N="175" REF="176">
&s;afe even from the &s;hafts of calumny, and will enjoy every comfort her pitiable &s;ituation can admit of. I already feel an intere&s;t in her welfare I know not how to de&s;cribe, and can have no higher &s;atisfaction than learn|ing from your ob&s;ervation, that her merit is equal to the opinion I have formed of it. I would accompany her to you, but fear le&s;t the offer &s;hould wound her delicacy, and I have told her I mean to be ab&s;ent perhaps many months: at the &s;ame time, I am apprehen&s;ive that her to|tal want of knowledge of the world unfits her for travelling alone; there|fore I &s;hall be mo&s;t anxious to hear of her &s;afe arrival at Warrington.
<PB N="176" REF="177">
Give me, dear Thom&s;on, this intel|ligence as early as po&s;&s;ible; direct to me at the&mdash;coffee hou&s;e, as I yet know not where I &s;hall be, and you will add to the numerous obligations already conferred on</P>

<P>Our hero that night &s;lept little: his mind was agitated and di&s;turbed with a thou&s;and hopes and fears: the beautiful Loui&s;a had made no trifling impre&s;&s;ion on his heart, though too prudent to avow it to her: but he flattered him&s;elf a few months re&s;i|dence with Mr. Thom&s;on, on who&s;e acute judgment and quick penetra|tion
<PB N="177" REF="178">
he knew he could rely, would confirm him in &s;uch an opinion of her mind and principles, as would render the offer of his heart and hand an act of no imprudence. Fired with this thought, he gave way to all the luxury a benevolent mind ever feels from the pro&s;pect of re&s;|cuing merit from unde&s;erved di&s;tre&s;s; and, when he met her in the morning, his countenance beamed with hope and animation.</P>
<P>Far different and le&s;s cheering ideas had engaged her attention. Her little pittance was &s;o nearly exhau&s;t|ed, as to leave her no pro&s;pect of reaching the &s;pot pointed out by the
<PB N="178" REF="179">
friendly hand of our hero, without another application to his bounty; and this her heart revolted at with all the dignity of a noble mind re|duced to poverty, but not to mean|ne&s;s: and the uncertainty of how &s;he ought to act in this dilemma had awakened every acuter feeling of her &s;oul, and hara&s;&s;ed her to &s;uch a de|gree, that &s;he retained no appearance of being benefited from the peaceful &s;lumber the earlier part of the night had afforded her. This di&s;tre&s;s was, however, &s;oon obviated by Sir George, who, well aware of the circum&s;tance, meant to remove it, but in the mo&s;t delicate manner.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">When the fir&s;t morning compli|ments were pa&s;t, he gave her a poc|ket-book, which he &s;aid enclo&s;ed the letter he wi&s;hed her to pre&s;ent to his friend; and added in a he&s;itating manner: "Do not, Mi&s;s Moreland, accu&s;e me of pre&s;uming on your goodne&s;s, if I acknowledge that in this pocket book you will al&s;o find a bank-note of a trifling value, which I mu&s;t entreat you to con&s;ider as your own. You are at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance from the place where I tru&s;t you will find a comfortable a&s;ylum; and, unaccu&s;tomed to travelling, may perhaps meet with impo&s;ition, which may render it nece&s;&s;ary for you to have an addition to that &s;um." He
<PB N="180" REF="181">
pau&s;ed, not well knowing how to go on; as in fact he was very certain &s;he could have no part of Mr. Saxby's bounty yet remaining.</P>
<P>Tears of gratitude bur&s;t from her eyes; but, &s;truggling for compo&s;ure, &s;he replied: "I &s;hould have little profited by the le&s;&s;ons of adver&s;ity, if one &s;park of pride were yet alive in my bo&s;om. I will not pain your noble heart, by refu&s;ing this &s;econd proof of your humanity; &s;ince, to confe&s;s the truth, without it your fir&s;t would have availed me not, as only the&s;e few &s;hillings (hold|ing up her pur&s;e) are left me of all that Mr. Saxby's charity afforded.

Nor perhaps ought I to blu&s;h whil&s;t I make this confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ince it is nei|ther the faults nor the errors of my own conduct that have reduced me to this di&s;tre&s;s; but the crimes, the barbarity, of tho&s;e who have driven &s;uch numbers of my defence|le&s;s &s;ex from their &s;acred, their peace|ful abodes, and forced them into a dependance on the world they had voluntarily re&s;igned."</P>
<P>This tacit accu&s;ation of the De|mocratic party rou&s;ed every heroic &s;entiment in the bo&s;om of Sir George; but his pity for the unfortunate Loui&s;a checked his violence, and he calmly an&s;wered: "It is always al|lowed
<PB N="182" REF="183">
that 'partial evil' is 'univer&s;al good;' and therefore, though &s;ome few may regret their cloi&s;tered walls, yet how many thou&s;ands, in &s;ucceed|ing generations, will have cau&s;e to rejoice at the de&s;truction of edifices to which ambition or avarice often con|&s;igned their wretched victims; whil&s;t pining for the world, and &s;ighing for the variety of public life, they &s;ilent|ly imprecated cur&s;es on tho&s;e who de|voted them to the &s;ervice of religion; and employed tho&s;e hours in fruitle&s;s murmurs, which, dedicated to &s;ocial virtues, might have added not mere|ly to their own happine&s;s but to that of all around them!"</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">"There is &s;ome ju&s;tice in your a&s;&s;ertion," replied Mi&s;s Moreland: "but you do not con&s;ider how many ages might have pa&s;&s;ed before an equal number had &s;uffered from the oppre&s;&s;ion you allude to, to tho&s;e who are now mi&s;erable and wandering exiles: be&s;ides, there have been many to whom, like my&s;elf, a convent was a re&s;ource from mi&s;ery; and there will be many more."</P>
<P>Our hero now felt he had hurt her, by defending a cau&s;e from which &s;he had &s;uffered &s;o much; and, attempt|ing to give the conver&s;ation a more cheerful turn, he &s;aid:&mdash;"At all events, Madam, I have unreturnable
<PB N="184" REF="185">
obligations to the Patriots for the de&s;truction of the convents; as, but for that, I &s;hould probably have ne|ver enjoyed the happine&s;s I now ex|perience from &s;eeing you."</P>
<P>She bowed in return to this com|pliment: but a heavy &s;igh proved to him, her heart beat not in uni&s;on with his; and the conviction mortified him. Ha&s;tily changing the conver|&s;ation, he began &s;peaking of the weather, concerned at ob&s;erving he had unde&s;ignedly given her pain. She &s;aw through his motive, and, grateful for it, exerted her &s;pirits, and endeavoured to be cheerful; but &s;he was unequal to the &s;truggle; and the
<PB N="185" REF="186">
carriage which had been ordered coming up to the door, the moment breakfa&s;t was over he led her to it, and before &s;he had repeated the ac|knowledgments &s;o much his due, it drove off whil&s;t &s;he was &s;peaking; and &s;he could only wave her hand in reply to his earne&s;t wi&s;hes for her &s;afety.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he was out of &s;ight our hero ordered his hor&s;e, and, when it was brought to him, re&s;umed his journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero, as he rode along reca|pitulating the events of his journey, was concerned to find the cau&s;e which had induced him to quit Warrington Ca&s;tle was not &s;o deeply fixed in his mind as at the fir&s;t; and the di&s;|covery hurt him, as he imagined it a proof of in&s;tability; the two in|&s;tances he had met with of the evil con&s;equences ari&s;ing from the opini|ons he defended having damped his ardour without altering his princi|ples; and he therefore, as &s;till ac|knowledging the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
thought him&s;elf inexcu&s;able in grow|ing cool. To animate his ideas, he now recalled all he had ever thought or read upon the &s;ubject; and before he reached &mdash; was once more in all the fury of patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>From a total want of knowledge of the world, and of the general character of men, and from a guile|le&s;s mind, who&s;e fir&s;t principle was benevolence, he had an idea of equa|lity corre&s;ponding with the manners of the golden age. In &s;uch a &s;tate, in the wildne&s;s and vivacity of his ima|gination, he formed pictures of bli&s;s that never really exi&s;ted, and only in Arcadia even ideally: he fancied
<PB N="188" REF="189">
all vice would be bani&s;hed &s;ociety; and that every man, &s;itting under the &s;hade of his own oaks, would culti|vate tho&s;e virtues alone which di&s;|tingui&s;hed our fir&s;t parents before the fall. But, alas! a re-entrance into Paradi&s;e is denied us on this &s;ide of the grave, and con&s;equently the hope of perfect happine&s;s in this world is as vain as it is impious.</P>
<P>But nothing can more &s;trongly prove the ab&s;urdity of the idea, than the daily proofs we &s;ee, that a &s;tate of equality is a &s;tate of envy, anarchy, and confu&s;ion. The woman of rank &s;ubmits to royalty, becau&s;e &s;he has been early taught it is her duty: but
<PB N="189" REF="190">
to her equals &s;he will not abate an inch of her prerogative; and would rather die, than yield the precedence to a lady who&s;e hu&s;band was created a Peer an hour after the ance&s;tors of her own Lord.</P>
<P>The wife of the Baronet yields to the Peere&s;s, but over a younger Ba|ronet's lady or an Honourable Mrs. exerts all the privileges the Court Calendar will allow. It is reported, that, in the rooms at Bath, the grand|daughters of an Earl and the daugh|ters of a Baronet contended &s;o vio|lently for the fir&s;t places in a coun|try-dance, that their milliners were greatly benefited by the battle; the
<PB N="190" REF="191">
floor being &s;trewed with the trophies of conque&s;t alternately gained by either party.</P>
<P>And it is the &s;ame in the Court, the City, or the Country. The mer|chant's wife at a watering-place is too wi&s;e to &s;eat her&s;elf, at a ball, on the forms placed for people of rank; but if the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies omits the di&s;tinctions &s;he thinks her due, and pays them to the relatives of another inhabitant of Crutched-Friars or Seething-Lane, her bo&s;om glows with all the fury of in&s;ulted dignity.</P>
<P>To de&s;cend a little lower: In a
<PB N="191" REF="192">
country town a&s;&s;embly, the Lawyer's and Clergyman's wives give way without he&s;itation to the 'Squire's fa|mily: by the &s;ame rule the trade&s;|men's wives yield to them, but, among each other, maintain an ob&s;tinate conte&s;t for the be&s;t &s;eat, or the fir&s;t cup of tea.</P>
<P>In a village, the &s;ame love of &s;upe|riority prevails; and the farmer's daughter, who can view without re|pining, though not perhaps without wi&s;hing, the gay bonnets and hats from the manor-hou&s;e, anxiou&s;ly di&s;plays the finery procured at the market-town at church on the Sun|days to her rural friends: but, &s;hould
<PB N="192" REF="193">
one of them eclip&s;e her, from that moment &s;he becomes an object of hatred, and the &s;truggle between them never cea&s;es.</P>
<P>Is it not evident from this picture, which nobody can controvert, that a &s;tate of equality can never exi&s;t? We all think it an ea&s;y &s;tep to ri&s;e above tho&s;e who are now on a level with us; and whil&s;t every one thinks the &s;ame, it is plain that &s;trength and abilities will conquer, whil&s;t the weak and illiterate will be pu&s;hed into a &s;itua|tion &s;till lower than that they were originally intended for.</P>
<P>Early in the afternoon, our hero
<PB N="193" REF="194">
&s;topped at the King's Arms at K&mdash;, and, having ordered his dinner, &s;at down to write a &s;econd letter to his friend Mr. Thom&s;on, which he &s;ent by the po&s;t. In this he gave another &s;light &s;ketch of Mi&s;s Moreland's hi&s;|tory, expre&s;&s;ed the intere&s;t he felt for her, and reque&s;ted an immediate re|ply. When this letter was di&s;patch|ed, and his &s;light repa&s;t concluded, he began to grow tired of his own re|flections, and enquired of the waiter if there were any company in the hou&s;e. The man replied in the ne|gative, except a few ha&s;ty travellers, who were only waiting for a change of hor&s;es; but added, "if he wi&s;hed for &s;ociety, there was a kind of cof|fee-room
<PB N="194" REF="195">
below, to which the gen|tlemen of the town and neighbour|hood re&s;orted, where he might have &s;ome very learned conver&s;ation among the politicians." This was exactly what he wanted; and he followed the waiter to an apartment below &s;tairs, which was then empty, but he &s;aid would not be &s;o long. He took up the papers; and, after reading about half an hour, his attention was en|gaged by the gentlemen who now entered very fa&s;t, and, forming their u&s;ual circle round the fire, began an intere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>One, who by his dre&s;s appeared to be a clergyman, laying down the
<PB N="195" REF="196">
paper and &s;haking his head, &s;aid, "He was &s;orry there were &s;till &s;o many per&s;ons di&s;affected to Govern|ment, when &s;o much pains had been taken by tho&s;e who&s;e talents fitted them for the ta&s;k, to convince them of the propriety of the pre&s;ent mea|&s;ures."</P>
<P>"Ay ay," cried a little thin man, who&s;e countenance be&s;poke di&s;con|tent, "it is all mighty well for you, Sir, to talk in this here manner, when you've got three hundred a-year in your pocket, only for a little preach|ing and praying. You're in the right to prai&s;e the Bi&s;hops, and the Lords, and them there &s;ort of people;
<PB N="196" REF="197">
but I knows better, and I reads as much as e'er a man in the town, and knows as well what's a-going forward; but 'twon't do&mdash;Liberty and Equality is my motto."</P>
<P>The other gentleman looked at him with much contempt, and com|po&s;edly replied: "I fear, Sir, you will in the end find your&s;elf in an error. Liberty, beyond what Engli&s;hmen already enjoy, is an airy vi&s;ion, and equality a wild chimera."</P>
<P>"I don't care," retorted the other angrily, "about hairy wi&s;ions and vile kimmerays; I &s;ay 'twill be a fine thing to have nobody no higher than one's
<PB N="197" REF="198">
&s;elf; and I'll &s;tand to it. Such a fu&s;s indeed here about the Mayor!&mdash; I don't &s;ee why I was not cho&s;e this year, in&s;tead of Mr. Pipkins; but I'll let 'em know my mind, and they &s;ha'n't hear the la&s;t on't for &s;ome time. Ay ay, next election I'll vote again&s;t the Mini&s;ter, I'll warrant, and then &s;ee who'll come bowing and &s;craping, with My dear Mr. Taylor, you were always a good friend to Government, and you won't now de&s;art us: but I &s;ays, &s;ays I, Sir, I won't be duped no more; haven't you promi&s;ed my &s;on Jack a place in the Cu&s;toms, for I don't know how long? And then I'll make my bow, and go into my &s;hop, and
<PB N="198" REF="199">
whip, Jack has the place in a week: but I'll be &s;tout yet, that's what I will."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry," returned the cler|gyman, "you have no better rea|&s;ons to urge in defence of your prin|ciples, Mr. Taylor, than &s;elf-intere&s;t: for that is no proof in favour of your cau&s;e; it rather militates again&s;t it."</P>
<P>"I don't care what it militates," an&s;wered the other. "What do I care for my country? 'Tis my&s;elf I thinks about."</P>
<P>"So it &s;eems," cried a fat gentle|man at the other &s;ide of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200">"To be &s;ure," returned he; "do you think I'd do like that fooli&s;h fel|low you was a-talking about here la&s;t week? What do you think, gentle|men, Mr. Goldney &s;aid? That, a good many years ago, one Squintus Squir|tous jumped into a pit for the &s;ake of his country: but I'd never jump in|to a pit, unle&s;s 'twas a mine, where I could &s;tuff my pockets with gold and come out again alive."</P>
<P>"Nobody imagines you would," replied Mr. Goldney contemptu|ou&s;ly; "but let me tell you, Sir, you will never fill your pockets with the profits of your trade, whil&s;t you avow &s;entiments which would
<PB N="200" REF="201">
render you a di&s;grace to any party. And I mu&s;t beg you never again to repeat a &s;tory of my relating, unle&s;s you can do it more correctly."</P>
<P>The little man, aba&s;hed by this re|proof, became &s;ilent, or only con|ver&s;ed in a low tone with his next neighbour, whil&s;t the other conti|nued:</P>
<P>"I own I am a republican, and glory in the title. I have a Roman &s;pirit; and the character of Brutus is my delight and my example. I would &s;acrifice, like him, my be&s;t friend to pre&s;erve my country; and my own life and fortune are as
<PB N="201" REF="202">
mere nothings in the &s;cale; univer&s;al benevolence is my religion, and uni|ver&s;al philanthropy my practice."</P>
<P>Our hero could no longer conceal the delight he felt at the&s;e words; for he had not yet been informed, that tho&s;e who profe&s;s univer&s;al be|nevolence acknowledge no other deity: nor had his own brea&s;t taught him any di&s;tinction; &s;ince, according to his principles, philanthropy was but the fruits of perfect Chri&s;tianity. He ha&s;tily threw down his paper, and, going up to Mr. Goldney, addre&s;&s;ed him on the &s;ubject he had been &s;peak|ing on, and that with &s;o much ani|mation as entirely won the other's
<PB N="202" REF="203">
heart; and a long conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;|ed between them, which ended in Mr. Goldney's giving Sir George an invitation to return with him to his hou&s;e, which was about a mile from the town, and &s;pend a day or two with him. Our hero frankly ac|cepted it; and a common ob&s;erver might have imagined, without any di&s;grace to his penetration, that the&s;e gentlemen had been friends, at lea&s;t intimates, from their infancy. The name of Brutus was frequently men|tioned by them with admiration and re&s;pect; which the little man over|hearing, it gave him a new &s;ubject for declamation.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">"Yes, yes, you may talk as you will about your Brutes of Romans; now in my mind they could not beat them French fellows; for in&s;tance, Moun&s;eer Eagle-ight, that we reads &s;o much about, he's as likely to knock down his cou&s;in for the &s;ake of his country as t'other was."</P>
<P>Sir George, to whom this man was a new character, began to be amu&s;ed by his ab&s;urdities; but Mr. Goldney had been &s;o often wearied by his loquacious ignorance, that he could now bear it no longer, but, &s;eizing our hero's arm, exclaimed peevi&s;hly: "Let us leave the&s;e fel|lows; there is not among them one
<PB N="204" REF="205">
who knows what he is talking about."</P>
<P>Sir George a&s;&s;ented; when at the door they were &s;topped by a real gen|tleman of the law, who with much unfeigned concern told Mr. Gold|ney "he had not put an execution in|to the hou&s;e of the man he had men|tioned to him, as the uncommon di&s;|tre&s;s of the family had excited his utmo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. The wife, he added, was lying-in, and almo&s;t in want of common nece&s;&s;aries; there|fore, at &s;uch a time to take from her the few comforts &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed would be the height of cruelty."</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206">The man of univer&s;al benevolence and philanthropy replied haughtily: "Sir, I will have my money; the poorer they are, the le&s;s likely am I to get it by any other means. Their di&s;tre&s;s is no bu&s;ine&s;s of yours. You do your duty, if you plea&s;e, Sir, and let me hear no more of their po|verty."</P>
<P>The gentleman's eyes fla&s;hed with the fire of hone&s;t indignation at this reply. "Yes, Sir," &s;aid he, "I will do my duty, which is, to proceed no farther in this cruel bu&s;ine&s;s: put it into other hands; I will not be your agent in this affair."</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">"Nor in any other then," replied Mr. Goldney furiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"As you plea&s;e," an&s;wered the gentleman with a &s;light bow, and then entered the room.</P>
<P>Our hero, infinitely &s;hocked at this conver&s;ation, followed him, and, put|ting five guineas into his hand, begged he would convey them to the family he had &s;poken of&mdash;and then vani&s;hed. He overtook his new friend in the gateway of the inn, where he was mounting his hor&s;e; and, his own having been previou&s;ly ordered, they &s;et out together. Sir George was much concerned at finding the prin|ciples and the practice of his compa|nion
<PB N="207" REF="208">
agree &s;o little; but he comforted him&s;elf by reflecting, that this was owing to the infirmity of human na|ture, as there were probably few minds in which &s;elf-love did not prevail over every other pa&s;&s;ion; and he hoped in time the noble &s;entiments he had &s;o openly avowed would correct the na|turally unfeeling qualities of his heart.</P>
