<HEAD>PREFACE TO Dalby Thomas, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> One of the COMMISSIONERS for Managing His Maje&s;ty's Duties on Gla&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Preface comes Directed to you, not as Commi&s;&s;ioner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under whom I have the Honour to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty; nor as a Friend; though I have great Obligations of that &s;ort al&s;o; but as the mo&s;t proper Judge of the Subjects Treated of, and more Capable than the greate&s;t part of Man|kind to Di&s;tingui&s;h and Under&s;tand them.</P>
<P><HI>Books</HI> are u&s;eful only to &s;uch who&s;e Geni|us are &s;uitable to the Subject of them: And to
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
Dedicate a Book of Projects to a Per&s;on who had never concern'd him&s;elf to Think that way, would be like Mu&s;ick to one that has no Ear.</P>
<P>And yet Your having a Capacity to Judge of the&s;e things, no way brings You under the De&s;picable Title of a <HI>Projector,</HI> any more than knowing the Practices and Sub|tleties of Wicked Men, makes a Man guilty of their Crimes.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Chapters of this Book, are the re&s;ults of particular Thoughts, occa|&s;ion'd by Conver&s;ing with the Publick Af|fairs during the pre&s;ent War with <HI>France.</HI> The Lo&s;&s;es and Ca&s;ualties which attend all Trading Nations in the World, when in|volved in &s;o Cruel a War as this, have reach'd us all, and I am none of the lea&s;t Sufferers; if this has put me, as well as others, on Inventions and Projects, &s;o much the Subject of this Book, 'tis no more than a proof of the Rea&s;on I give for the general Projecting Humour of the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4">
One unhappine&s;s I lie under in the fol|lowing Book, <HI>viz.</HI> That having kept the greate&s;t Part of it by me for near Five Years, &s;everal of the Thoughts &s;eem to be hit by other Hands, and &s;ome by the Pub|lick; which turns the tables upon me, as if I had Borrow'd from them.</P>
<P>As particularly that of the Seamen, which you know well I had contriv'd long before the Act for Regi&s;tring Seamen was Propos'd. And that of Educating Women, which I think my &s;elf bound to Declare, was form'd long before the Book call'd <HI>Advice to the Ladies,</HI> was made Pub|lick; and yet I do not Write this to Mag|nify my own Invention, but to acquit my &s;elf from Grafting on other People's Thoughts. If I have Tre&s;pa&s;s'd upon any Per&s;on in the World, 'tis upon Your &s;elf, from whom I had &s;ome of the Noti|ons about County Banks, and Factories for Goods, in the Chapter of Banks; and yet I do not think that my Propo|&s;al
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
for the Women, or the Seamen, cla&s;hes at all, either with that Book, on the Publick method of Regi&s;tring Seamen.</P>
<P>I have been told &s;ince this was done, That my Propo&s;al for a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion of Enquiries into Bankrupt E&s;tates,</HI> is Borrow'd from the <HI>Dutch;</HI> if there is any thing like it among the <HI>Dutch,</HI> 'tis more than ever I knew, or know yet; but if &s;o, I hope 'tis no Objection again&s;t our having the &s;ame here, e&s;pecially if it be true, that 'twou'd be &s;o publickly Beneficial as is expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid of <HI>Friendly Societies,</HI> I think no Man will Di&s;pute with me, &s;ince one has met with &s;o much Succe&s;s already in the Practice of it, I mean, <HI>The Friendly Society for Widows,</HI> of which you have been pleas'd to be a Governor.</P>
<P>Friendly Societies are very exten&s;ive, and as I have hinted, might be carri'd on to many Particulars. I have omitted one which was mention'd in Di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="v" REF="6">
with your &s;elf; where a Hundred Trade&s;men, all of &s;everal Trades, Agree together to Buy whatever they want of one another, and no where el&s;e, <HI>Prices</HI> and <HI>Payments</HI> to be &s;ettled among them|&s;elves; whereby every Man is &s;ure to have Ninety nine Cu&s;tomers, and can never want a Trade: And I cou'd have fill'd up the Book with In&s;tances of like nature, but I never de&s;ign'd to tire the Reader with Particulars.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al of the <HI>Pen&s;ion-Office</HI> you will &s;oon &s;ee offer'd to the Publick, as an Attempt for the Relief of the Poor; which if it meets with Encouragement, will every way an&s;wer all the great Things I have &s;aid of it.</P>
<P>I had Wrote a great many Sheets about the Coin, about bringing in Plate to the Mint, and about our Standard; but &s;o many great Heads being upon it, with &s;ome of whom my Opinion does not agree, I wou'd not adventure to appear in Print upon that Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7">
Ways and Means al&s;o I have laid by on the &s;ame &s;core. Only adhering to this one Point, That be it by Taxing the Wares they Sell, be it by Taxing them in Stock, be it by Compo&s;ition, <HI>which, by the way, I believe is the be&s;t;</HI> be it by what way &s;o|ever the Parliament plea&s;e, the Retailers are the Men who &s;eem to call upon us to be Tax'd; if not by their own extraor|dinary good Circum&s;tances, though that might bear it, yet by the contrary in all other Degrees of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Retailers are the only men who cou'd pay it with lea&s;t damage, becau&s;e it is in their power to levy it again upon their Cu&s;tomers in the Prices of their Goods, and is no more than paying a higher Rent for their Shops.</P>
<P>The Retailers of Manufactures, e&s;pe|cially &s;o far as relates to the Inland Trade, have never been tax'd yet, and their Wealth or Number is not ea&s;ily calcula|ted: Trade and Land has been handled
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
roughly enough; and the&s;e are the men who now lye as a Re&s;erve to carry on the Burthen of the War.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Men, who, were the Land-Tax collected as it &s;hou'd be, ought to pay the King more than that whole Bill ever produc'd; and yet the&s;e are the men who I think I may venture to &s;ay, do not pay a Twentieth part in that Bill.</P>
<P>Shou'd the King appoint a Survey over the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and Indict all tho&s;e who were found faulty; allowing a Re|ward to any Di&s;coverer of an A&s;&s;e&s;sment made lower than the literal Sen&s;e of the Act implies, What a Regi&s;ter of Frauds and Connivances wou'd be found out!</P>
<P>In a General Tax, if any &s;hou'd be excus'd, it &s;hou'd be the Poor, who are not able to pay, or at lea&s;t are pinch'd in the nece&s;&s;ary parts of Life by paying: And yet here a poor Labourer who works for Twelve-Pence or Eighteen-Pence a Day, does not
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
drink a Pot of Beer, but pays the King a Tenth part for Exci&s;e; and really pays more to the King's Taxes in a year, than a Coun|trey Shopkeeper, who is Alderman of the Town, worth perhaps Two or Three Thou|&s;and Pounds, brews his own Beer, pays no Exci&s;e, and in the Land-Tax is rated it may be 100 <HI>l.</HI> and pays 1 <HI>l.</HI> 4 <HI>s. per Annum:</HI> But ought, if the Act were put in due execution, to pay 36 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to the King.</P>
<P>If I were to be ask'd how I wou'd re|medy this? I wou'd an&s;wer, It &s;hou'd be by &s;ome Method in which every man may be tax'd in the due proportion to his E&s;tate, and the Act put in execution, according to the true Intent and Meaning of it; in order to which a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion of A&s;&s;e&s;sment</HI> &s;hou'd be granted to Twelve Men, &s;uch as His Ma|je&s;ty &s;hou'd be well &s;atisfied of, who &s;hou'd go through the whole Kingdom, Three in a Body, and &s;hou'd make a new A&s;|&s;e&s;sment of Per&s;onal E&s;tates, <HI>not to meddle with Land.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="10">
To the&s;e A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hou'd all the Old Rates, Pari&s;h-Books, Poor-Rates, and Highway-Rates al&s;o be delivered; and upon due Enquiry to be made into the Man|ner of Living, and reputed Wealth of the People, the Stock or Per&s;onal E&s;tate of every man &s;hou'd be a&s;&s;e&s;s'd, without Connivance; and he who is reputed to be worth a Thou&s;and Pound, &s;hou'd be tax'd at a Thou&s;and Pound; and &s;o on: And he who was an over-grown Rich Trade&s;|man of Twenty or Thirty thou&s;and Pounds E&s;tate, &s;hou'd be tax'd &s;o, and Plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and Plain Dealing be practis'd indifferently throughout the Kingdom; Trade&s;men and Landed men &s;hou'd have Neighbours Fare, as we call it; and a Rich Man &s;hou'd not be pa&s;s'd by when a Poor Man pays.</P>
<P>We read of the Inhabitants of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> that they &s;uffer'd their City to be lo&s;t, for want of contributing in time for its Defence; and pleaded Poverty to
<PB N="x" REF="11">
their Generous Emperor, when he went from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e to per&s;uade them; and yet when the <HI>Turks</HI> took it, the Prodigious Immen&s;e Wealth they found in it, made 'em wonder at the &s;ordid Temper of the Citizens.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> (with due Exceptions to the Parliament, and the Freedom where|with they have given to the Publick Charge) is much like <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> we are involv'd in a Dangerous, a Chargeable, but withal a mo&s;t Ju&s;t and Nece&s;&s;ary War, and the Riche&s;t and Mo|ney'd Men in the Kingdom plead Poverty; and the <HI>French,</HI> or King <HI>James,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI> may come for them, if they can but conceal their E&s;tates from the Publick Notice, and get the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to tax them at an Under-Rate.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the men this Commi&s;&s;ion wou'd di&s;cover; and here they &s;hou'd find men tax'd at 500 <HI>l.</HI> Stock, who are worth 20000 <HI>l.</HI> Here they &s;hou'd find a certain Rich Man near <HI>Hackney,</HI> rated to day
<PB N="xi" REF="12">
in the Tax-Book at 1000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock, and to morrow offering 27000 <HI>l.</HI> for an E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Here they &s;hou'd find Sir <HI>J&mdash; C&mdash;</HI> perhaps tax'd to the King at 5000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;tock, perhaps not &s;o much, who&s;e Ca&s;h no man can gue&s;s at: And multitudes of In&s;tances I cou'd give by name, without wrong to the Gentlemen.</P>
<P>And not to run on in Particulars, I affirm, That in the Land-Tax Ten certain Gentlemen in <HI>London</HI> put together, did not pay for half &s;o much Per&s;onal E&s;tate, call'd <HI>Stock,</HI> as the poore&s;t of them is reputed really to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>I do not enquire at who&s;e door this Fraud mu&s;t lye, 'tis none of my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h they wou'd &s;earch into it, who&s;e Power can puni&s;h it. But this with Sub|mi&s;&s;ion I pre&s;ume to &s;ay;</P>
<P>The King is thereby defrauded and hor|ribly abus'd; the true Intent and Mean|ing of Acts of Parliament evaded; the Nation involv'd in Debt by fatal Deficien|cies
<PB N="xii" REF="13">
and Intere&s;ts; Fellow-Subjects abus'd, and new Inventions for Taxes occa&s;ion'd.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Chapter in this Book is a Pro|po&s;al about entring all the Seamen in <HI>Eng|land</HI> into the King's Pay; a Subject which de&s;erves to be enlarg'd into a Book it &s;elf; and I have a little Volume of Cal|culations and Particulars by me on that Head, but I thought them too long to pub|li&s;h. In &s;hort, I am per&s;uaded, was that Method propos'd to tho&s;e Gentlemen to whom &s;uch things belong, the greate&s;t Sum of Money might be rais'd by it, with the lea&s;t Injury to tho&s;e who pay it, that ever was or will be during the War.</P>
<P><HI>Projectors,</HI> they &s;ay, are generally to be taken with allowance of one half at lea&s;t; they always have their mouths full of Mil|lions, and talk big of their own Propo&s;als; and therefore I have not expos'd the va&s;t Sums my Calculations amount to, but I venture to &s;ay I could procure a Farm on &s;uch a Propo&s;al as this at Three Millions <HI>per Ann.</HI>
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
and give very good Security for Payment; &s;uch an Opinion I have of the Value of &s;uch a Method; and when that is done, the Nation wou'd get Three more by pay|ing it; which is very &s;trange, but might ea&s;ily be made out.</P>
<P>In the Chapter of Academies, I have ventur'd to reprove the Vicious Cu&s;tom of Swearing: I &s;hall make no Apology for the Fact; for no man ought to be a&s;ham'd of expo&s;ing what all men ought to be a&s;ham'd of practi&s;ing: But methinks I &s;tand cor|rected by my own Laws a little, in forcing the Reader to repeat &s;ome of the wor&s;t of our Vulgar Imprecations, in reading my Thoughts again&s;t it: To which, however, I have this to reply;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I did not find it ea&s;y to expre&s;s what I mean, without putting down the very Words, at lea&s;t not &s;o as to be very Intelligible.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Why &s;hould Words repeated only to expo&s;e the Vice, taint the Reader,
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
more than a Sermon preach'd again&s;t Lewd|ne&s;s &s;hould the A&s;&s;embly; for of nece&s;&s;ity it leads the Hearer to the Thoughts of the Fact; but the Morality of every Action lies in the End; and if the Reader by ill u&s;e renders him&s;elf guilty of the Fact in Reading, which I de&s;ign'd to expo&s;e by Writing, the Fault is his, not mine.</P>
<P>I have endeavour'd every where in this Book to be as Conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, ex|cept where Calculations oblig'd me to be particular; and having avoided Imperti|nence in the <HI>Book,</HI> I wou'd avoid it too in the <HI>Preface;</HI> and therefore &s;hall break off with &s;ub&s;cribing my &s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>_NEce&s;&s;ity, which is al|low'd to be the Mo|ther of Invention, has &s;o violently agitated the Wits of men at this time, that it &s;eems not at all improper, by way of di|&s;tinction, to call it, <HI>The Projecting Age.</HI> For tho' in times of War and Publick Confu&s;ions, the like Humour of Invention has &s;eem'd to &s;tir; yet, without being partial to the pre&s;ent, it is, I think, no Injury to &s;ay, the pa&s;t Ages have never come up to the de|gree of Projecting and Inventing, as it refers to Matters of Negoce, and
<PB N="2" REF="17">
Methods of Civil Polity, which we &s;ee this Age arriv'd to.</P>
<P>Nor is it a hard matter to a&s;&s;ign probable Cau&s;es of the Perfection in this Modern Art. I am not of their melancholy Opinion, who a&s;cribe it to the general Poverty of the Nation; &s;ince I believe 'tis ea&s;y to prove, the Nation it &s;elf, taking it as one Gene|ral Stock, is not at all dimini&s;h'd or impoveri&s;h'd by this Long, this Chargeable War; but on the contra|ry, was never Richer, &s;ince it was in|habited.</P>
<P>Nor am I ab&s;olutely of the Opini|on, that we are &s;o happy as to be Wi&s;er in this Age, than our Fore|fathers; tho' at the &s;ame time I mu&s;t own, &s;ome parts of Knowledge in Science as well as Art, has received Improvements in this Age, altogether conceal'd from the former.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="18">
The Art of War, which I take to be the highe&s;t Perfection of Human Knowledge, is a &s;ufficient Proof of what I &s;ay, e&s;pecially in conducting Armies, and in offen&s;ive Engines; <HI>witne&s;s</HI> the new ways of Mines, Fou|gades, Entrenchments, Attacks, E|lodgments, and a long <HI>Et Cetera</HI> of New Inventions which want Names, pra|cti&s;ed in Sieges and Encampments; <HI>witne&s;s</HI> the new &s;orts of Bombs and unheard-of Mortars, of Seven to Ten Ton Weight, with which our Fleets &s;tanding two or three Miles off at Sea, can imitate God Almighty him|&s;elf, and rain <HI>Fire and Brim&s;tone</HI> out of Heaven, as it were, upon Towns built on the firm Land; <HI>witne&s;s al&s;o</HI> our new-invented <HI>Child of Hell,</HI> the Machine, which carries Thunder, Lightning, and Earthquakes in its
<PB N="4" REF="19">
Bowels, and tears up the mo&s;t im|pregnable Fortifications.</P>
<P>But if I would &s;earch for a Cau&s;e, from whence it comes to pa&s;s that this Age &s;warms with &s;uch a multitude of Projectors more than u&s;ual; who be|&s;ides the Innumerable Conceptions which dye in the bringing forth, and (like Abortions of the Brain) only come into the Air, and di&s;&s;olve, do really every day produce new Contrivances, Engines, and Projects to get Money, never before thought of; if, I &s;ay, I would examine whence this comes to pa&s;s, it mu&s;t be thus:</P>
<P>The Lo&s;&s;es and Depredations which this War brought with it at fir&s;t, were exceeding many, &s;uffer'd chiefly by the Ill Conduct of Merchants them|&s;elves, who did not apprehend the Danger to be really what it was: For before our Admiralty could po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="5" REF="20">
&s;ettle Convoys, Crui&s;ers, and Stations for Men of War all over the World, the <HI>French</HI> cover'd the Sea with their Privateers, and took an incredible number of our Ships. I have heard the Lo&s;s computed by tho&s;e who pre|tended they were able to gue&s;s, at above Fifteen Millions of Pounds <HI>&s;ter|ling,</HI> in Ships and Goods, in the fir&s;t two or three Years of the War: A Sum, which if put into <HI>French,</HI> would make &s;uch a rumbling Sound of great Numbers, as would fright a weak Accomptant out of his belief, being no le&s;s than One hundred and Ninety Millions of <HI>Livres.</HI> The weight of this Lo&s;s fell chiefly on the Tra|ding Part of the Nation; and among&s;t them, on the Merchants; and among&s;t them again upon the mo&s;t refin'd Ca|pacities, as the In&s;urers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And an incredible number of the be&s;t Mer|chants
<PB N="6" REF="21">
in the Kingdom &s;unk under the Load; as may appear a little by a Bill which once pa&s;s'd the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the Relief of Mer|chant-In&s;urers, who had &s;uffered by the War with <HI>France.</HI> If a great ma|ny fell, much greater were the num|ber of tho&s;e who felt a &s;en&s;ible Ebb of their Fortunes, and with difficulty bore up under the Lo&s;s of great part of their E&s;tates. The&s;e, prompted by Nece&s;&s;ity, rack their Wits for New Contrivances, New Inventions, New Trades, Stocks, Projects, and any thing to retrieve the de&s;perate Credit of their Fortunes. That this is pro|bable to be the Cau&s;e, will appear further thus; <HI>France,</HI> tho' I do not believe all the great Outcries we make of their Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s, if one half of which be true, they are cer|tainly the be&s;t Subjects in the world;
<PB N="7" REF="22">
yet without que&s;tion has felt its &s;hare of the Lo&s;&s;es and Damages of the War; But the Poverty there falling chiefly on the Poorer &s;ort of People, they have not been &s;o fruitful in In|ventions and Practices of this nature, their Genius being quite of another &s;train. As for the Gentry and more capable &s;ort, the fir&s;t thing a <HI>French</HI> man flies to in his di&s;tre&s;s, is the Ar|my; and he &s;eldom comes back from thence to Get an E&s;tate by painful Indu&s;try, but either has his Brains knock'd out, or makes his Fortune there.</P>
<P>If Indu&s;try be in any Bu&s;ine&s;s re|warded with &s;ucce&s;s, 'tis in the Mer|chandizing Part of the World, who indeed may more truly be &s;aid to live by their Wits than any people what&s;o|ever. All Foreign Negoce, tho' to &s;ome 'tis a plain road by the help of
<PB N="8" REF="23">
Cu&s;tom, yet it is in its beginning all Project, Contrivance, and Invention. Every new Voyage the Merchant con|trives, is a Project; and Ships are &s;ent from Port to Port, as Markets and Merchandizes differ, by the help of &s;trange and Univer&s;al Intelligence; wherein &s;ome are &s;o exqui&s;ite, &s;o &s;wift, and &s;o exact, that a Merchant &s;itting at home in his Counting-hou&s;e, at once conver&s;es with all Parts of the known World. This, and Travel, makes a True-bred Merchant the mo&s;t Intelligent Man in the World, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t capable, when urg'd by Nece&s;&s;ity, to Contrive New Ways to live. And from hence, I humbly conceive, may very properly be deriv'd the <HI>Projects,</HI> &s;o much the Subject of the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. And to this &s;ort of men 'tis ea&s;y to trace the Original of Banks, Stocks, Stock|jobbing,
<PB N="9" REF="24">
A&s;&s;urances, Friendly Socie|ties, Lotteries, and the like.</P>
<P>To this may be added, the long annual Enquiry in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons for Ways and Means, which has been a particular movement to &s;et all the Heads of the Nation at work; and I appeal, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to the Gentle|men of that Honourable Hou&s;e, if the greate&s;t part of all the Ways and Means, out of the common road of Land-Taxes, Polls, and the like, have not been handed to them from the Merchant, and in a great mea&s;ure Paid by 'em too.</P>
<P>However I offer this but as an E&s;&s;ay at the Original of this prevaling Hu|mour of the People; and as 'tis pro|bable &s;o, 'tis al&s;o po&s;&s;ible to be other|wi&s;e; which I &s;ubmit to future de|mon&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="25">
Of the &s;everal ways this Faculty of Projecting have exerted it &s;elf, and of the various Methods, as the Genius of the Authors has inclin'd, I have been a diligent Ob&s;erver, and in mo&s;t an unconcern'd Spectator; and, perhaps, have &s;ome advantage from thence more ea&s;ily to di&s;cover the <HI>faux Pas</HI> of the Actors. If I have given an E&s;&s;ay towards any thing New, or made Di&s;covery to advantage of any Con|trivance now on foot, all Men are at the liberty to make u&s;e of the Improve|ment; if any Fraud is di&s;cover'd, as now practis'd, 'tis without any parti|cular Reflection upon Parties or Per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>Projects of the nature I Treat about, are doubtle&s;s in general of pub|lick Advantage, as they tend to Im|provement of Trade, and Employ|ment of the Poor, and the Circulati|on
<PB N="11" REF="26">

<P>Wherefore 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tin|gui&s;h among the Projects of the pre|&s;ent times, between the Hone&s;t and the Di&s;hone&s;t.</P>
<P>There are, and that too many, fair pretences of fine Di&s;coveries, new Inventions, Engines, and I know not what, which being advanc'd in Noti|on, and talk'd up to great things to be perform'd when &s;uch and &s;uch Sums of Money &s;hall be advanc'd, and &s;uch and &s;uch Engines are made, have rais'd the Fancies of Credulous People to &s;uch height, that meerly

on the &s;hadow of Expectation, they have form'd Companies, cho&s;e Com|mittees, appointed Officers, Shares, and Books, rais'd great Stocks, and cri'd up an empty Notion to that de|gree, that People have been betray'd to part with their Money for Shares in a <HI>New-Nothing;</HI> and when the In|ventors have carri'd on the Je&s;t till they have Sold all their own Intere&s;t, they leave the Cloud to vani&s;h of it &s;elf, and the poor Purcha&s;ers to Quar|rel with one another, and go to Law about Settlements, Transferrings, and &s;ome Bone or other thrown among 'em by the Subtlety of the Author, to lay the blame of the Mi&s;carriage upon them&s;elves. Thus the Shares at fir&s;t begin to fall by degrees, and happy is he that Sells in time; till like Bra&s;s Money it will go at la&s;t for nothing at all. So have I &s;een Shares

<P>I might go on upon this Subject to expo&s;e the Frauds and Tricks of <HI>Stock-Jobbers, Engineers, Patentees, Commit|tees,</HI> with tho&s;e <HI>Exchange-Mountebanks</HI> we very properly call <HI>Brokers;</HI> but I have

<HEAD>THE Hi&s;tory of Projects.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I &s;peak of Wri|ting a <HI>Hi&s;tory of Projects,</HI> I do not mean either of the Introduction of, or Continuing nece&s;&s;ary Inventions, or the Improve|ment of Arts and Sciences before known; but a &s;hort Account of Pro|jects, and Projecting, as the Word is allow'd in the general Acceptation at this pre&s;ent time, and I need not go far back for the Original of the Pra|ctice.</P>
<P>Invention of Arts with Engines and Handycraft In&s;truments for their Improvement, requires a Chronology
<PB N="20" REF="35">
as far back as the Elde&s;t Son of <HI>Adam,</HI> and has to this day afforded &s;ome new Di&s;covery in every Age.</P>
<P>The Building of the Ark by <HI>Noah,</HI> &s;o far as you will allow it a human Work, was the fir&s;t Project I read of; and no que&s;tion &s;eem'd &s;o ridiculous to the Graver Heads of that Wi&s;e, tho' Wicked Age, that poor <HI>Noah</HI> was &s;ufficiently banter'd for it; and had he not been &s;et on work by a very pe|culiar Direction from Heaven, the Good old Man would certainly have been laugh'd out of it, as a mo&s;t &s;en&s;e|le&s;s ridiculous Project.</P>
<P>The Building of <HI>Babel</HI> was a Right Project; for indeed the true definition of a Project, according to Modern Acceptation, is, as is &s;aid before, a va&s;t Undertaking, too big to be ma|nag'd, and therefore likely enough to come to nothing; and yet as great as they are, 'tis certainly true of 'em all,
<PB N="21" REF="36">
even as the Projectors propo&s;e; that according to the old tale, If &s;o many Eggs are hatch'd, there will be &s;o ma|ny Chickens, and tho&s;e Chickens may lay &s;o many Eggs more, and tho&s;e Eggs produce &s;o many Chickens more, and &s;o on. Thus 'twas mo&s;t certain|ly true, That if the People of the Old World cou'd have Built a Hou&s;e up to Heaven, they &s;hou'd never be Drown'd again on Earth, and they on|ly had forgot to Mea&s;ure the Heighth, <HI>that is,</HI> as in other Projects, it only Mi&s;carri'd, or el&s;e 'twou'd have Suc|ceeded.</P>
<P>And yet when all's done, that very Building, and the incredible Heighth it was carri'd, is a Demon&s;tration of the va&s;t Knowledge of that Infant-Age of the World, who had no ad|vantage of the Experiments or Inven|tion of any before them&s;elves.</P>
<Q><PB N="22" REF="37">
<L>Thus when our Fathers touch'd with Guilt,</L>
<L>That <HI>Huge Stupendious Stair-Ca&s;e</HI> Built;</L>
<L>We Mock indeed the fruitle&s;s Enterprize,</L>
<L>For fruitle&s;s Actions &s;eldom pa&s;s for Wi&s;e;</L>
<L>But were the <HI>Mighty Ruins</HI> left, they'd &s;how,</L>
<L>To what Degree that Untaught Age did Know.</L></Q>
<P>I believe a very diverting Account might be given of this, but I &s;hall not attempt it. Some are apt to &s;ay with <HI>Solomon, No new thing happens under the Sun, but what is, has been;</HI> yet I make no que&s;tion but &s;ome con|&s;iderable Di&s;covery has been made in the&s;e latter Ages, and Inventions of Human Original produc'd, which the World was ever without before, ei|ther in whole, or in part; and I refer only to two Cardinal Points, the u&s;e of the Load-&s;tone at Sea, and the
<PB N="23" REF="38">
u&s;e of Gunpowder and Guns; both which, as to the Inventing-part, I believe the World owes as ab&s;olutely to tho&s;e particular Ages, as it does the Working in Bra&s;s and Iron to <HI>Tu|bal Cain,</HI> or the Inventing of Mu&s;ick to <HI>Jubal</HI> his Brother. As to Engines and In&s;truments for Handycraft-Men, this Age, I dare &s;ay, can &s;how &s;uch as never were &s;o much as thought of, much le&s;s imitated before; for I do not call that a real Invention which has &s;omething before done like it, I account that more properly an Im|provement. For Handycraft In&s;tru|ments, I know none owes more to true genuine Contrivance, without bor|rowing from any former u&s;e, than a Mechanick Engine contriv'd in our time, call'd, <HI>A Knitting Frame,</HI> which built with admirable Symetry, works really with a very happy Succe&s;s, and may be ob&s;erv'd by the Curious to have a
<PB N="24" REF="39">
more than ordinary Compo&s;ition; for which I refer to the Engine it &s;elf, to be &s;een in every Stocking-Weaver's Garret.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trace the Original of the Projecting Humour that now reigns, no farther back than the Year 1680. dating its Birth as a Mon&s;ter then, tho' by times it had indeed &s;ome|thing of life in the time of the late Civil War. I allow, no Age has been altogether without &s;omething of this nature; and &s;ome very hap|py Projects are left to us as a ta&s;te of their Succe&s;s; as the Water-hou&s;es for &s;upplying of the City of <HI>London</HI> with Water; and &s;ince that, the <HI>New-River,</HI> both very Con&s;iderable Under|takings, and Perfect Projects, adven|tur'd on the ri&s;que of Succe&s;s. In the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, infinite Projects were &s;et on foot for Rai&s;ing Mo|ney without a Parliament; Oppre&s;&s;ing by Monopolies, and Privy Seals; but
<PB N="25" REF="40">
the&s;e are excluded our Scheme, as Irre|gularities; for thus the <HI>French</HI> are as fruitful in Projects as we; and the&s;e are rather Stratagems than Projects. After the Fire of <HI>London,</HI> the Contri|vance of an Engine to Quench Fires, was a Project the Author was &s;aid to get well by, and we have found to be very u&s;eful. But about the Year 1680. began the Art and My&s;tery of Proje|cting to creep into the World. Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Uncle to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond, gave great Encouragement to that part of it that re&s;pects Engines, and Mechanical Motions; and Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins</HI> added as much of the Theory to it, as writing a Book could do: The Prince has left us a Metal call'd by his Name; and the fir&s;t Project upon that was, as I remember, Ca&s;ting of Guns of that Metal, and boring them; done both by a peculiar Method of his own, and which died with him,
<PB N="26" REF="41">
to the great lo&s;s of the Undertaker, who to that purpo&s;e had, with no &s;mall Charge, erected a Water-Mill at <HI>Hack|ney-Mar&s;h,</HI> known by the name of the <HI>Temple-Mill:</HI> Which Mill very happily perform'd all parts of the Work; and I have &s;een of tho&s;e Guns on board the Royal <HI>Charles,</HI> a Fir&s;t-rate Ship, being of a Reddi&s;h Colour, different either from Bra&s;s or Copper. I have heard &s;ome Rea&s;ons of State a&s;&s;ign'd, why that Project was not permit|ted to go forward; but I omit them, becau&s;e I have no good Au|thority for it: After this, we &s;aw a Floating Machine, to be wrought with Hor&s;es for the Towing of Great Ships both again&s;t Wind and Tide; and another for the rai&s;ing of Balla&s;t which, as unperforming Engines, had the honour of being Made, Expos'd, Tri'd, and laid by, before the Prince died.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="42">
If thus we introduce it into the World under the Conduct of that Prince; when he died, 'twas left a hopele&s;s Brat, and had hardly any Hand to own it, till the Wreck-Voy|age before-noted, perform'd &s;o happily by Captain <HI>Phips,</HI> afterwards Sir <HI>Wil|liam;</HI> who&s;e &s;trange Performance &s;et a great many Heads on work to contrive &s;omething for them&s;elves; he was im|mediately follow'd by my Lord <HI>Mor|dant,</HI> Sir <HI>John Narborough,</HI> and others from &s;everal Parts, who&s;e Succe&s;s made 'em &s;oon weary of the Work.</P>
<P>The Project of the <HI>Penny-Po&s;t,</HI> &s;o well known, and &s;till practis'd, I can|not omit; nor the Contriver Mr. <HI>Dock|wra,</HI> who has had the honour to have the Injury done him in that Affair, re|pair'd in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the publick Ju&s;tice of the Parliament. And the Experiment proving it to be a Noble and U&s;eful De&s;ign, the Author mu&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="43">
be remembred, where-ever mention is made of that Affair, to his very great Reputation.</P>
<P>'Twas no que&s;tion a great hard&s;hip for a man to be Ma&s;ter of &s;o fine a Thought, that had <HI>both</HI> the <HI>E&s;&s;ential Ends of a Project</HI> in it, <HI>Publick Good,</HI> and <HI>Private Advantage;</HI> and that the Publick &s;hou'd reap the benefit, and the Author be left out; the Inju&s;tice of which, no doubt, di&s;courag'd many a Good De&s;ign: But &s;ince an Altera|tion in Publick Circum&s;tances has re|cover'd the lo&s;t Attribute of Ju&s;tice, the like is not to be fear'd. And Mr. <HI>Dock|wra</HI> has had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the former Injury di&s;own'd, and an ho|nourable Return made even by them who did not the Injury, in bare re|&s;pect to his Ingenuity.</P>
<P>A while before this, &s;everal Peo|ple, under the Patronage of &s;ome great Per&s;ons, had engag'd in Plant|ing
<PB N="29" REF="44">

<PB N="30" REF="45">
could be handl'd with; for while the Brokers held the Box, they made the whole <HI>Exchange</HI> the Game|&s;ters, and rais'd and lower'd the Prices of Stocks as they pleas'd; and always had both Buyers and Sellers who &s;tood ready innocently to commit their Money to the mercy of their Mercenary Tongues. This Up&s;tart of a Trade having ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of Succe&s;s which generally attends a <HI>No|vel Propo&s;al,</HI> introduces the Illigiti|mate wandring Object I &s;peak of, as a proper Engine to find Work for the Brokers. Thus Stock-Jobbing nurs'd Projecting, and Projecting in return has very diligently pimp'd for its Fo&s;ter|parent, till both are arriv'd to be Pub|lick Grievances; and indeed are now almo&s;t grown &s;candalous.</P>

than otherwi&s;e he would do; not but that there are other great advantages a <HI>Royal Bank</HI> might procure in this Kingdom, as has been &s;een in part by this, As advancing Money to the <HI>Ex|chequer</HI> upon Parliamentary Funds and Securities, by which in time of a War our Preparations for any Expedition need not be in danger of Mi&s;carriage for want of Money, though the Taxes rais'd be not &s;peedily paid, nor the <HI>Exchequer</HI> burthen'd with the exce&s;&s;ive Intere&s;ts paid in former Reigns upon Anticipations of the Revenue; Land|ed Men might be &s;upplied with Mo|neys upon Securities on ea&s;ier Terms, which would prevent the Lo&s;s of mul|titudes of E&s;tates, now ruin'd and de|vour'd by in&s;olent and mercile&s;s Mort|gagees and the like.

<PB N="41" REF="56">
becau&s;e they have promis'd them; yet they are all Future that we know of.</P>
<P>And yet all this while a Bank might be very beneficial to this Kingdom; and This might be &s;o, if either their own Ingenuity, or Publick Authority, would oblige them to take the Publick Good into equal Concern with their Private Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>To explain what I mean;</HI></P>
<P>Banks being e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Publick Authority, ought al&s;o, as all Publick things are, to be under Limitations and Re&s;trictions from that Authority; and tho&s;e Limitations being regulated with a proper regard to the Ea&s;e of Trade in General, and the Improve|ment of the Stock in Particular, would make a Bank a U&s;eful, Profitable Thing indeed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, A Bank ought to be of a Magnitude proportion'd to the Trade of the Countrey it is in; which this
<PB N="42" REF="57">
Bank is &s;o far from, that 'tis no more to the Whole, than the lea&s;t Gold|&s;mith's Ca&s;h in <HI>Lombard&s;treet</HI> is to the Bank: From whence it comes to pa&s;s, that already more Banks are contri|ving; and I que&s;tion not but Banks in <HI>London</HI> will e're long be as frequent as Lotteries: The Con&s;equence of which in all Probability will be, the dimini&s;hing their Reputation, or a Civil War with one another. 'Tis true, the Bank of <HI>England</HI> has a Ca|pital Stock; but yet was that Stock wholly clear of the Publick Concern of the Government, it is not above a Fifth Part of what would be nece&s;&s;ary to manage the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Town; which it ought, tho' not to do, at lea&s;t to be Able to do: And I &s;uppo&s;e I may venture to &s;ay, Above one half of the Stock of the pre&s;ent Bank is taken up in the Affairs of the Exchequer.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="58">
I &s;uppo&s;e no body will take this Di&s;cour&s;e for an Invective again&s;t the Bank of <HI>England;</HI> I believe it is a ve|ry Good Fund, a very U&s;eful one, and a very Profitable one: It has been U&s;eful to the Government, and it is Profitable to the Proprietors; and the e&s;tabli&s;hing it at &s;uch a Juncture, when our Enemies were making great boa&s;ts of our Poverty and Want of Money, was a particular Glory to our Nation, and the City in particular. That when the <HI>Paris Gazette</HI> inform'd the World, That the Parliament had indeed given the King Grants for rai&s;ing Money in Funds to be paid in remote Years; but Money was &s;o &s;carce, that no An|ticipations could be procured: That ju&s;t then, be&s;ides Three Millions paid into the Exchequer that Spring on other Taxes by way of Advance, there was an Overplus-Stock to be found of 1200 000 Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> or (to make
<PB N="44" REF="59">
it &s;peak <HI>French</HI>) of above Fifteen Mil|lions, which was all paid Voluntarily into the Exchequer, in le&s;s than <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span"> Be&s;ides this, I believe the pre&s;ent Bank of <HI>England</HI> has been ve|ry u&s;eful to the Exchequer, and to &s;upply the King with Remittances for the Payment of the Army in <HI>Flanders;</HI> which has al&s;o, by the way, been very profitable to it &s;elf. But &s;till this Bank is not of that Bulk that the Bu&s;ine&s;s done here requires; nor is it able, with all the Stock it has, to procure the great propos'd Benefit, the low'r|ing the Intere&s;t of Money: Whereas all Foreign Banks ab&s;olutely govern the Intere&s;t, both at <HI>Am&s;terdam, Ge|noa,</HI> and other places. And this De|fect I conceive the Multiplicity of Banks cannot &s;upply, unle&s;s a perfect Under&s;tanding could be &s;ecur'd be|tween them.</P>
<P>To remedy this Defect, &s;everal
<PB N="45" REF="60">
Methods might be propos'd: Some I &s;hall take the Freedom to hint at.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the pre&s;ent Bank in|crea&s;e their Stock to at lea&s;t Five Mil|lions <HI>&s;terling,</HI> to be &s;ettled as they are already, with &s;ome &s;mall Limitations to make the Methods more beneficial.</P>
<P>Five Millions <HI>&s;terling</HI> is an immen&s;e Sum; to which add the Credit of their Ca&s;h, which would &s;upply them with all the Overplus-Money in the Town, and probably might amount to half as much more; and then the Credit of Running-Bills, which by circulating would no que&s;tion be an Equivalent to the other half: So that in Stock, Credit, and Bank-bills, the Balance of their Ca&s;h would be al|ways Ten Millions <HI>&s;terling:</HI> A Sum that every body who can talk of, does not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>But then to find Bu&s;ine&s;s for all this Stock; which though it be a
<PB N="46" REF="61">
&s;trange thing to think of, is neverthe|le&s;s ea&s;y when it comes to be exa|min'd. And fir&s;t for the Bu&s;ine&s;s; This Bank &s;hou'd enlarge the Number of their Directors as they do of their Stock; and &s;hould then e&s;tabli&s;h &s;eve|ral Sub-Committees, compos'd of their own Members, who &s;hould have the directing of &s;everal Offices rela|ting to the di&s;tinct &s;orts of Bu&s;ine&s;s they referr'd to; to be over-rul'd and govern'd by the Governor and Di|rectors in a Body, but to have a Conclu&s;ive Power as to Contracts. Of the&s;e there &s;hould be</P>
<P>One Office for Loan of Money for Cu&s;toms of Goods; which by a plain Method might be &s;o order'd, that the Merchant might with ea&s;e pay the highe&s;t Cu&s;toms down; and &s;o by al|lowing the Bank 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Advance, be fir&s;t &s;ure to &s;ecure the 10 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> which the King allows for Prompt
<PB N="47" REF="62">
Payment at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e;</HI> and be al&s;o freed from the trouble&s;ome work of finding <HI>Bonds-Men,</HI> and Securi|ties for the Money; which has expos'd many a Man to the Tyranny of Ex|tents either for him&s;elf or his Friend, to his utter Ruin; who under a more moderate Pro&s;ecution, had been able to pay all his Debts; and by this Method has been torn to pieces, and di&s;abled from making any tolerable Propo&s;al to his Creditors. This is a Scene of Large Bu&s;ine&s;s, and would in proportion employ a Large Ca&s;h: And 'tis the ea&s;ie&s;t thing in the world to make the Bank the Payma&s;ter of all the Large Cu&s;toms, and yet the Mer|chant have &s;o honourable a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Goods, as may be neither any Diminution to his Reputation, or any Hindrance to their Sale.</P>
<P><HI>As for Example:</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I have 100 Hog&s;heads of
<PB N="48" REF="63">
Tobacco to Import, who&s;e Cu&s;toms by &s;everal Duties comes to 1000 <HI>l.</HI> and want Ca&s;h to clear them; I go with my Bill of Loading to the Bank, who appoint their Officer to Enter the Goods, and pay the Duties; which Goods &s;o entred by the Bank, &s;hall give them Title enough to any part, or the whole, without the trou|ble of Bills of Sale, or Conveyances, Defeazances, and the like. The Goods are carried to a Warehou&s;e at the Wa|ter&s;ide, where the Merchant has a Free and Publick Acce&s;s to them, as if in his own Warehou&s;e, and an ho|nourable Liberty to &s;ell and deliver either the Whole (paying their Di&s;|bur&s;e) or a Part without it, leaving but &s;ufficient for the Payment; and out of that Part delivered, either by Notes under the Hand of the Purcha|&s;er, or any other way, he may clear the &s;ame, without any Exactions, but
<PB N="49" REF="64">
of 4 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and the re&s;t are his own.</P>
<P>The ea&s;e this wou'd bring to Trade, the deliverance it wou'd bring to the Merchants from the in&s;ults of Gold|&s;miths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the honour it wou'd give to our management of Publick Impo&s;ts, with the advantages to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e it &s;elf, and the utter de&s;truction of Extortion, wou'd be &s;uch as wou'd give a due value to the Bank, and make all Mankind acknow|ledge it to be a publick good. The Grievance of Exactions upon Mer|chants in this ca&s;e is very great; and when I lay the blame on the Gold|&s;miths, becau&s;e they are the principal People made u&s;e of in &s;uch occa&s;ions, I include a great many other &s;orts of Brokers, and Money-jobbing Arti&s;ts, who all get a &s;nip out of the Mer|chant. I my &s;elf have known a Gold|&s;mith in <HI>Lumbard&s;treet</HI> Lend a Man

700 <HI>l.</HI> to pay the Cu&s;toms of a Hun|dred Pipes of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wines; the Wines were made over to him for Se|curity by Bill of Sale, and put into a Cellar, of which the Gold&s;mith kept the Key; the Merchant was to pay 6 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t on the Bond, and to allow 10 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Premio for advancing the Money: When he had the Wines in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Owner cou'd not &s;end his Cooper to look after them, but the Gold&s;mith's Man mu&s;t attend all the while, for which he wou'd be paid 5 <HI>s.</HI> a day. If he brought a Cu&s;tomer to &s;ee them, the Gold&s;mith's Man mu&s;t &s;how them; the Money was Lent for Two Months; he cou'd not be admitted to Sell or Deliver a Pipe of Wine out &s;ingle, or Two or Three at a time, as he might have Sold them; but on a word or two &s;poken ami&s;s to the Gold&s;mith <HI>or which he was plea&s;ed to take &s;o</HI>

<HEAD>Of the HIGH-WAYS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a prodigious Charge the whole Nation groans under for the Repair of High-Ways, which, after all, lie in a very ill Po&s;ture too; I make no que&s;tion but if it was taken into Con&s;ideration by tho&s;e who have the Power to Direct it, the Kingdom might be wholly eas'd of that Burthen, and the High-Ways be kept in good condition, which now lie in a mo&s;t &s;hameful manner in mo&s;t

<P>The Rate for the High-Ways is the mo&s;t Arbitrary and Unequal Tax in the Kingdom; in &s;ome places two or three Rates of 6 <HI>d. per. l.</HI> in the year, in others the whole Pari&s;h cannot rai&s;e wherewith to defray the Charge, either by the very bad condition of the Road, or di&s;tance of Materials; in others the Surveyors rai&s;e what they never Expend; and the Abu&s;es, Ex|actions, Connivances, Frauds, and Embezlements, are innumerable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> while they Govern'd this I&s;land, made it one of their prin|cipal cares to Make and Repair the High-Ways of the Kingdom, and the
<PB N="70" REF="85">
Chief Roads we now u&s;e, are of their Marking out; the Con&s;equence of maintaining them was &s;uch, or at lea&s;t &s;o e&s;teem'd, that they thought it not below them to Employ their <HI>Le|gionary Troops</HI> in the Work; and it was &s;ometimes the Bu&s;ine&s;s of whole Armies, either when in Winter-quar|ters, or in the intervals of Truce or Peace with the Natives. Nor have the <HI>Romans</HI> left us any greater tokens of their Grandeur and Magnificence, than the ruins of tho&s;e Cau&s;ways and Street|ways which are at this day to be &s;een in many parts of the Kingdom; &s;ome of which has by the vi&s;ible Remains been di&s;cover'd to traver&s;e the whole Kingdom; and others for more than an Hundred Miles are to be trac'd from Colony to Colony, as they had particular occa&s;ion.

<P>If we &s;et a&s;ide the Barbarity and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as <HI>Heathens,</HI> and take them as a Civil Government, we mu&s;t allow they were the Pattern of the whole World for Improvement and Increa&s;e of Arts and Learning, Civilizing and Methodizing Nations and Countries Conquer'd by their Valour; and if this was one of their great Cares, That con&s;ideration ought to move &s;omething.

<P><PB N="75" REF="90"><HI>The Propo&s;al is as follows.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That an Act of Parliament be made, with Liberty for the Under|takers to Dig and Trench, to cut down Hedges and Trees, or whatever is need|ful for ditching, dreining and carrying off Water, cleaning, enlarging and le|velling the Roads, with Power to lay open or inclo&s;e Lands; to incroach in|to Lands, dig, rai&s;e, and level Fen|ces, plant and pull up Hedges or Trees, for the enlarging, widening, and dreining the High-Ways, with Power to turn either the Roads, or Water-Cour&s;es, Rivers and Brooks, as by the Directors of the Works &s;hall be found needful, <HI>always allow|ing</HI> &s;atisfaction to be fir&s;t made to the Owners of &s;uch Lands, either by a&s;|&s;igning to them equivalent Lands, or Payment in Money, the Value to

<P>But before I proceed, I mu&s;t &s;ay a word or two to this Article.</P>
<P>The Chief, and almo&s;t the Only Cau&s;e of the deepne&s;s and foulne&s;s of the Roads, is occa&s;ion'd by the &s;tand|ing Water, which for want of due care to draw it off by &s;couring and opening Ditches and Dreins, and o|ther Water-Cour&s;es, and clearing of Pa&s;&s;ages, &s;oaks into the Earth, and &s;oftens it to &s;uch a degree, that it can|not bear the weight of Hor&s;es and Carriages; to prevent which, the Pow|er to Dig, Trench, and Cut down, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mention'd above, will be of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity: But becau&s;e the liberty

<P>It is well known to all who have any knowledge of the Condition the High-Ways in <HI>England</HI> now lye in, that in mo&s;t places there is a convenient di&s;tance of Land left open for travel|ling, either for driving of Cattel, or marching of Troops of Hor&s;e, with perhaps as few Lanes or <HI>Defiles,</HI> as in any Countries: The Cro&s;s-Roads, which are generally Narrow, are yet Broad enough in mo&s;t places for two Carriages to pa&s;s; but on the other hand, we have on mo&s;t of the High-Roads a great deal of wa&s;te-Land thrown in as it were for an Overplus to the High-Way; which though it be us'd of cour&s;e by Cattle and Travel|lers on occa&s;ion, is indeed no Benefit

at all either to the Traveller as a Road, or to the Poor as a Common, or to the Lord of the Mannor as a Wa&s;te; upon it grows neither Timber nor Gra&s;s, in any quantity an&s;werable to the Land; but, tho to no purpo&s;e, is trodden down, poach'd, and over|run by Drifts of Cattle in the Winter, or &s;poil'd with the Du&s;t in the Sum|mer: And this I have ob&s;erv'd in ma|ny parts of <HI>England</HI> to be as good Land as any of the Neighbouring Enclo&s;ures, as capable of Improvement, and to as good purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Lands only being enclos'd and manur'd, leaving the Roads to Dimen&s;ions without mea&s;ure &s;ufficient, are the Fund upon which I build the Prodigious Stock of Money that mu&s;t do this Work.

<P>Another Branch of the Stock mu&s;t be Hands; for a Stock of Men is a Stock of Money; to which purpo&s;e every County, City, Town, and Pa|ri&s;h, &s;hall be Rated at a Set Price, equi|valent to Eight Years Payment for the Repair of High-ways; which each County, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall rai&s;e, not by A&s;|&s;e&s;sment in Money, but by pre&s;&s;ing of Men, Hor&s;es, and Carriages for the Work; the Men, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be employ'd by the Directors: In which ca&s;e all Corporal Puni&s;hments,

<ITEM>(3.) For Depopulations, the con|trary &s;hou'd be &s;ecur'd, by obliging the Undertakers, at &s;uch and &s;uch certain di&s;tances, to erect Cottages, Two at lea&s;t

Large Common, Fore&s;t, or Wa&s;te without a Hedge on either hand for a certain di&s;tance, there the &s;everal Pa|ri&s;hes &s;hall allot the Directors a certain quantity of the Common to lie Pa|rallel with the Road, at a propor|tioned number of Feet to the Length and Breadth of the &s;aid Road; con|&s;ideration al&s;o to be had to the Nature of the Ground, or el&s;e giving them only room for the Road directly, &s;hall &s;uffer them to Enclo&s;e in any one Spot &s;o much of the &s;aid Common, as &s;hall be equivalent to the like quantity of Land lying by the Road; thus where the Land is good, and the Materials for erecting a Cau&s;way near, the le&s;s Land may &s;erve; and on the contra|ry the more; but in general, allowing them the quantity of Land propor|tioned to the length of the Cau&s;way, and Forty Rod in Breadth, tho' where the Land is poor, as on Downs and
<PB N="90" REF="105">
Plains, the Proportion mu&s;t be con|&s;ider'd to be adju&s;ted by the Coun|try.</P>
<P>Another Point for the Dimen&s;ions of Roads, &s;hou'd be adju&s;ted; and the Breadth of them, I think, cannot be le&s;s than thus:</P>
<P>From <HI>London</HI> every way 10 Miles the High Po&s;t-Road to be Built full 40 Foot in Breadth, and 4 Foot High, the Ditches 8 Foot Broad, and 6 Foot Deep, and from thence onward 30 Foot, and &s;o in Proportion.</P>
<P>Cro&s;s Roads to be 20 Foot Broad, and Ditches Proportion'd; no Lanes and Pa&s;&s;es le&s;s than 9 Foot without Ditches.</P>
<P>The Middle of the High Cau&s;e|ways to be Pav'd with Stone, Chalk, or Gravel, and kept always Two Foot Higher than the Sides, that the Water might have a free cour&s;e into the Ditch|es, and Per&s;ons kept in con&s;tant Em|ploy
<PB N="91" REF="106">
to fill up Holes, let out Water, open Dreins, and the like, as there &s;hou'd be occa&s;ion: A proper Work for Highwaymen, and &s;uch Malefa|ctors, as might on tho&s;e Services be exempt'd from the Gallows.</P>
<P>It may here be Objected, That Eight Years A&s;&s;e&s;sment to be demand|ed down, is too much in rea&s;on to expect any of the Poorer &s;ort can pay; as for In&s;tance; If a Farmer who keeps a Team of Hor&s;e be at the common A&s;&s;e&s;sment, to Work a Week, it mu&s;t not be put &s;o hard upon any Man, as to Work Eight Weeks toge|ther. 'Tis ea&s;y to An&s;wer this Obje|ction.</P>
<P>So many as ate wanted, mu&s;t be had; if a Farmer's Team cannot be &s;par'd without prejudice to him &s;o long together, he may &s;pare it at &s;un|dry times, or agree to be A&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and pay the A&s;&s;e&s;sment at &s;undry Pay|ments;
<PB N="92" REF="107">
and the Bank may make it as ea&s;y to them as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Another Method, however, might be found to fix this Work at once; As &s;uppo&s;e a Bank be &s;ettled for the High|ways of the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> which as they are, without doubt, the mo&s;t us'd of any in the Kingdom, &s;o al&s;o they require the more Charge, and in &s;ome Parts lie in the wor&s;t Condi|tion of any in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>If the Parliament fix the Charge of the Survey of the High-Ways upon a Bank to be Appointed for that Pur|po&s;e, for a certain term of Years, the Bank Undertaking to do the Work, or to Forfeit the &s;aid Settlement.</P>
<P><HI>As thus:</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the Tax on Land, and Tenements for the whole County of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> does, or &s;hou'd be &s;o or|der'd, as it might amount to 20000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> more or le&s;s, which it now

To the Que&s;tion, What I wou'd do to them? I An&s;wer,<LIST>
<ITEM><P N="1">(1.) For the 67 Miles of High Po&s;t-Road, I Propo&s;e to throw up a firm &s;trong Cau&s;way well bottom'd, 6 Foot high in the middle, and 4 Foot on the &s;ide, fac'd with Brick or Stone, and crown'd with Gravel, Chalk, or Stone, as the &s;everal Countries they are made through will afford, being 44 Foot in Breadth, with Ditches on either &s;ide 8 Foot Broad and 4 Foot Deep; &s;o the whole Breadth will be 60 Foot, if the Ground will permit.</P>
<P>At the end of every Two Miles, or &s;uch like convenient di&s;tances, &s;hall be a Cottage Erected, with Half an Acre of Ground allow'd, which &s;hall be given <HI>Gratis,</HI> with 1 <HI>s. per</HI> Week Wages, to &s;uch Poor Man of the Pa|ri&s;h, as &s;hall be approv'd, who &s;hall Once, at lea&s;t, every day, view his Walk, to open Pa&s;&s;ages for the Water
<PB N="100" REF="115">
to run into the Ditches, to fill up Holes or &s;oft Places.</P>
<P>Two Riders &s;hall be allow'd to be always moving the Rounds, to view every thing out of Repair, and make Report to the Directors, and to &s;ee that the Cottagers do their Duty.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P N="2">(2.) For the 140 Miles of Cro&s;s-Road, a like Cau&s;way to be made, but of different Dimen&s;ions, the Breadth 20 Foot, if the Ground will allow it, the Ditches 4 Foot Broad, 3 Foot Deep, the Heighth in the middle 3 Foot, and on the &s;ides 1 Foot, or 2 where it may be needful; to be al&s;o crown'd with Gravel, and 1 <HI>s. per</HI> Week to be allow'd to the Poor of every Pari&s;h, the Con&s;tables to be Bound to find a Man to Walk on the High-Way every Divi&s;ion, for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e as the Cottagers do on the Greater Roads.</P>
<P>Po&s;ts to be &s;et up at every turning
<PB N="101" REF="116">
to Note whither it goes, for the Di|rection of Strangers, and how many Miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) For a 1000 Miles By-Lanes, only good and &s;ufficient Care to keep them in Repair as they are, and to carry the Water off by clearing and cutting the Ditches, and laying Ma|terials where it is wanted.</P></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is what I Propo&s;e to do to them; and what if once perform'd, I &s;uppo&s;e all People wou'd own to be an Undertaking both U&s;eful and Honour|able.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Second Que&s;tion I Pro|po&s;e to give an Account of, is, What the Charge will be.</P>
<P>Which I account thus;</P>
<P>The Work of the great Cau&s;way I Propo&s;e, &s;hall not Co&s;t le&s;s than 10 <HI>s. per</HI> Foot, &s;uppo&s;ing Materials to be Bought, Carriage and Mens La|bour to be all Hir'd, which for 67
<PB N="102" REF="117">
Miles in Length, is no le&s;s than the Sum of 176880 Pounds; as thus,</P>
<P>Every Mile accounted at 1760 Yards, and 3 Foot to the Yard, is 5280 Foot, which at 10 <HI>s. per</HI> Foot, is 2640 <HI>l. per</HI> Mile, and that again Multiplied by 67, makes the &s;um of 176880, into which I include the Charge of Water-Cour&s;es, Mills to throw off Water where needful, Dreins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To this Charge mu&s;t be added, Ditching to Enclo&s;e Land for 30 Cot|tages, and Building 30 Cottages at 40 <HI>l.</HI> each, which is 1200 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>The Work of the &s;maller Cau&s;way I Propo&s;e to fini&s;h at the Rate of 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Foot, which being for 140 Miles in Length, at 5280 Foot <HI>per</HI> Mile, amounts to 36960 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Ditching, Dreining, and Repairing 1000 Miles, &s;uppos'd at 3 <HI>s. per</HI> Rod, as for 320000 Rod, is 48000 <HI>l.</HI> which

<P>If I were to Propo&s;e &s;ome Mea|&s;ures for the ea&s;ing this Charge, I cou'd, perhaps, lay a Scheme down how it may be perform'd for le&s;s than one half of this Charge.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, By a grant of the Court at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> whereby all &s;uch Cri|minals as are Condemn'd to Die for &s;maller Crimes, may in&s;tead of Tran|&s;portation be Order'd a Year's Work on the High-Ways; others in&s;tead of Whippings, a proportion'd Time, and the like; which wou'd, by a mo|derate computation, provide us gene|rally
<PB N="104" REF="119">
a &s;upply of 200 Workmen, and coming in as fa&s;t as they go off; and let the Over&s;eers alone to make them Work.</P>
<P>Secondly, By an Agreement with the <HI>Guinea</HI>-Company to furni&s;h 200 <HI>Negroes,</HI> who are generally Per&s;ons that do a great deal of Work; and all the&s;e are Sub&s;i&s;ted very rea&s;onably out of a Publick Store-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thirdly, By Carts and Hor&s;es to be Bought, not Hir'd, with a few Able Carters; and to the other a few Workmen that have Judgment to Di|rect the re&s;t; and thus I que&s;tion not the Great Cau&s;way &s;hall be done for 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Foot Charge; but of this by the by.</P>
<P>Fourthly, A Liberty to ask Chari|rities and Benevolences to the Work.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) To the Que&s;tion, How this Money &s;hall be Rais'd? I think if the Parliament &s;ettle the Tax on the
<PB N="105" REF="120">
County for Eight Years, at 30000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> no Man need ask, how it &s;hall be Rais'd,&mdash;It will be ea&s;y enough to Rai&s;e the Money; and no Pari&s;h can grudge to pay a little larger Rate for &s;uch a Term, on condition never to be Tax'd for the High-Ways any more.</P>
<P>Eight Years A&s;&s;e&s;sment at 30000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> is enough to afford to Bor|row the Money by way of Anticipa|tion, if need be, the Fund being &s;ecur'd by Parliament, and appropriated to that U&s;e and no other.</P>
<P>As to what Security for Perform|ance:</P>
<P>The Lands which are Enclos'd may be appropriated by the &s;ame Act of Parliament to the Bank and Underta|kers, upon condition of Performance, and to be Forfeit to the u&s;e of the &s;e|veral Pari&s;hes to which they belong, in ca&s;e upon Pre&s;entation by the Grand
<PB N="106" REF="121">
Juries, and rea&s;onable Time given, any part of the Roads in &s;uch and &s;uch Pari&s;hes, be not kept and main|tain'd in that Po&s;ture they are Pro|pos'd to be. Now the Lands thus &s;ettled are an eternal Security to the Country, for the keeping the Roads in Repair; becau&s;e they will always be of &s;o much Value over the need|ful Charge, as will make it worth while to the Undertakers to pre&s;erve their Title to them; and the Tenure of them being &s;o precarious, as to be liable to Forfeiture on Default, they will always be careful to uphold the Cau&s;ways.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, What Profit to the Under|takers? For we mu&s;t allow them to Gain, and that con&s;iderably, or no Man wou'd undertake &s;uch a Work.</P>
<P>To this I propo&s;e, Fir&s;t,</P>
<P>During the Work allow them out of the Stock 3000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for Ma|nagement.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="122">
After the Work is fini&s;h'd, &s;o much of the 5000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> as can be &s;av'd, and the Roads kept in good Repair, let be their own; and if the Lands Secur'd be not of the Value of 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, let &s;o much of the Eight Years Tax be &s;et apart as may Pur|cha&s;e Land to make them up; if they come to more, let the Benefit be to the Adventurers.</P>
<P>It may be Objected here, That a Tax of 30000 <HI>l.</HI> for Eight Years will come in as fa&s;t as it can well be laid out, and &s;o no Anticipations will be requi&s;ite; for the whole Work Pro|pos'd cannot be probably fini&s;hed in le&s;s Time; and if &s;o,

which is 13000 <HI>l.</HI> more than the
<PB N="108" REF="123">
Charge; and if the Work be done &s;o much Cheaper, as is mentioned, the Profit to the Undertaker will be Un|rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>To this I &s;ay, I wou'd have the Undertakers bound to accept the Sal|lary of 3000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for Manage|ment, and if a whole Years Tax can be &s;par'd, either leave it Unrais'd up|on the Country, or put it in Bank to be improv'd again&s;t any occa&s;ion, of Building, perhaps, a great <HI>Bridge;</HI> or &s;ome very wet Sea&s;on, or Fro&s;t, may &s;o Damnify the Works, as to make them require more than ordinary Re|pair. But the Undertakers &s;hou'd make no private Advantage of &s;uch an Overplus, there might be ways enough found for it.</P>
<P>Another Objection lies again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility of Enclo&s;ing the Lands up|on the Wa&s;te, which generally belongs

<P>This may be An&s;wer'd in General, That an Act of Parliament is <HI>Omni|potent</HI> with re&s;pect to Titles and Te|nures of Land, and can Empower Lords and Tenants to Con&s;ent to what el&s;e they cou'd not; as to Particulars, they cannot be An&s;wer'd till they are Propos'd; but there is no doubt but an Act of Parliament may adju&s;t it all in one Head.</P>
<P>What a Kingdom wou'd <HI>England</HI> be if this were perform'd in all the Counties of it! and yet I believe it is fea&s;ible, even in the wor&s;t. I have narrowly ob&s;erv'd all the Con&s;iderable Ways in that unpa&s;&s;able County of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> which e&s;pecially in &s;ome parts in the <HI>Wild,</HI> as they very properly call

it, of the County, hardly admits the Countrey People to Travel to Mar|kets in Winter, and makes Corn dear at Market becau&s;e it can't be brought, and cheap at the Farmer's Hou&s;e be|cau&s;e he can't carry it to Market; yet even in that County wou'd I un|dertake to carry on this Propo&s;al, and that to great Advantage, if back'd with the Authority of an Act of Par|liament.</P>
<P>I have &s;een in that horrible Coun|try the Road 60 to 100 Yards Broad, lie from &s;ide to &s;ide all Poach'd with Cattel, the Land of no manner of Benefit, and yet no going with a Hor&s;e, but at every &s;tep up to the Shoulders, full of Sloughs and Holes, and covered with &s;tanding-water. It co&s;ts them incredible Sums of Money to Repair them; and the very Places that are mended, wou'd fright a young Traveller to go over them: The <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="126">
Ma&s;ter'd this Work, and by a firm Cau&s;eway made a High-way quite through this deep Country, through <HI>Darkin</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI> to <HI>Stan&s;ted,</HI> and thence to <HI>Okeley,</HI> and &s;o on to <HI>Arundel;</HI> its Name tells us what it was made of; for it was call'd <HI>Stone|&s;treet,</HI> and many vi&s;ible parts of it re|main to this day.</P>
<P>Now would any Lord of a Mannor refu&s;e to allow 40 Yards in breadth out of that Road I mention'd, to have the other 20 made into a Firm, Fair, and Plea&s;ant Cau&s;eway over that Wilder|ne&s;s of a Countrey?</P>
<P>Or would not any man acknow|ledge, That putting this Country into a condition for Carriages and Travellers to pa&s;s, would be a great Work? The Gentlemen would find the Benefit of it in the Rent of their Land, and Price of their Timber; the Countrey Peo|ple would find the difference in the

Sale of their Goods, which now they cannot carry beyond the fir&s;t Market-Town, and hardly thither; and the whole County would reap an Advan|tage an hundred to one greater than the Charge of it.

<HEAD>Of ASSURANCES.</HEAD>
<P>ASSURANCES among Mer|chants I believe may plead Pre|&s;cription, and has been of u&s;e time out of mind in Trade; tho perhaps never &s;o much a Trade as now.</P>
<P>'Tis a Compact among Merchants. Its beginning being an Accident to
<PB N="113" REF="128">
Trade, and aro&s;e from the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e of Mens Tempers,</HI> who having run lar|ger Adventures in a &s;ingle Bottom than afterwards they found convenient, grew fearful and unea&s;y; and di&s;co|vering their unea&s;ine&s;s to others, who, perhaps, had no Effects in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el, they offer to bear part of the Hazard for part of the Profit; Con|venience made this a Cu&s;tom, and Cu&s;tom brought it into a Method, till at la&s;t it becomes a Trade.</P>
<P>I cannot que&s;tion the Lawfulne&s;s of it, &s;ince all Ri&s;que in Trade is for Gain; and when I am nece&s;&s;itated to have a greater Cargo of Goods in &s;uch or &s;uch a Bottom, than my Stock can afford to lo&s;e, another may <HI>&s;urely</HI> offer to go a Part with me; and as 'tis ju&s;t if I give another part of the Gain, he &s;hou'd run part of the Ri&s;que, &s;o it is as ju&s;t, that if he runs part of my Ri&s;que, he &s;hou'd have part
<PB N="114" REF="129">
of the Gain. Some Object the di&s;|parity of the Premio to the Hazard, when the En&s;urer runs the Ri&s;que of 100 <HI>l.</HI> on the Seas from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Lon|don</HI> for 40 <HI>s.</HI> which, &s;ay they, is pre|po&s;terous and unequal. Though this Objection is hardly worth An&s;wering to Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, yet it looks &s;ome|thing fair to them that know no bet|ter; and for the Information of &s;uch, I trouble the Reader with a few Heads.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They mu&s;t con&s;ider the En&s;u|rer is out no Stock.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is but one Ri&s;que the En&s;urer runs, whereas the A&s;&s;ured has had a Ri&s;que out, a Ri&s;que of Debts abroad, a Ri&s;que of a Market, and a Ri&s;que of his Factor, and has a Ri&s;que of a Market to come, and therefore ought to have an an&s;werable Profit.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If it has been a Trading Voyage, perhaps, the Adventurer has Paid Three or Four &s;uch Premio's,
<PB N="115" REF="130">
which &s;ometimes make the En&s;urer clear more by a Voyage, than the Merchant; I my &s;elf have Paid 100 <HI>l.</HI> En&s;urances in tho&s;e &s;mall Premio's on a Voyage I have not gotten 50 <HI>l.</HI> by; and I &s;uppo&s;e I am not the fir&s;t that has done &s;o neither.</P>
<P>This way of A&s;&s;uring has al&s;o, as other Arts of Trade have, &s;uffer'd &s;ome Improvement (if I may be al|low'd that Term) in our Age; and the fir&s;t &s;tep upon it, was an <HI>En&s;urance-Office for Hou&s;es to En&s;ure them from Fire;</HI> Common Fame gives the Pro|ject to Dr. <HI>Barebone;</HI> a Man, I &s;up|po&s;e, better known as a Builder than a Phy&s;ician. Whether it were his, or who&s;e it was, I do not enquire; it was &s;ettled on a Fund of Ground-Rents, to An&s;wer in ca&s;e of Lo&s;s, and met with very good Acceptance.</P>
<P>But it was &s;oon follow'd by another, by way of <HI>Friendly Society;</HI> where every
<PB N="116" REF="131">
one who Sub&s;cribe, pay their <HI>Quota</HI> to Build up any Man's Hou&s;e who is a Contributor, if it &s;hall happen to be Burnt. I won't decide which is the Be&s;t, or which Succeeded be&s;t, but I believe the latter brings in mo&s;t Money to the Contriver.</P>
<P>Only one Benefit I cannot omit which they reap from the&s;e Two Socie|ties who are not concern'd in either, That if any Fire happen, whether in Hou&s;es En&s;ur'd or not En&s;ur'd, they have each of them a &s;et of Lu&s;ty Fel|lows, generally Water-men, who be|ing immediately call'd up, where-ever they live, by Watchmen Appointed, are, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, very Active and Diligent in helping to put out the Fire.</P>
<P>As to any further Improvement to be made upon A&s;&s;urances in Trade, no que&s;tion there may, and I doubt
<PB N="117" REF="132">
not but on Payment of a &s;mall Duty to the Government, the King might be made the General En&s;urer of all Foreign Trade: Of which more un|der another Head.</P>
<P>I am of the opinion al&s;o, that an Office of En&s;urance Erected to En&s;ure the Titles of Lands, in an Age where they are &s;o precarious as now, might be a Project not unlikely to &s;ucceed, if E&s;tabli&s;h'd on a good Fund. But I &s;hall &s;ay no more to that, becau&s;e it &s;eems to be a De&s;ign in hand by &s;ome Per&s;ons in Town, and is indeed no Thought of my own.</P>
<P>En&s;uring of Life I cannot admire; I &s;hall &s;ay nothing to it; but that in <HI>Italy</HI> where <HI>Stabbing</HI> and <HI>Poy&s;oning</HI> is &s;o much in Vogue, &s;omething may be &s;aid for it, and on contingent An|nuities; and yet I never knew the thing much approv'd of on any ac|count.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="118" REF="133">
<HEAD>Of FRIENDLY-SOCIETIES.</HEAD>
<P>ANother Branch of En&s;urance, is by Contribution, or (to bor|row the Term from that before-men|tion'd) <HI>Friendly-Societies;</HI> which, is in &s;hort, a Number of People entring into a Mutual Compact to Help one another, in ca&s;e any Di&s;a&s;ter or Di|&s;tre&s;s fall upon them.</P>
<P>If Mankind cou'd agree, as the&s;e might be Regulated, all things which have Ca&s;ualty in them, might be Se|cur'd. But one thing is Particularly requir'd in this way of A&s;&s;urances; None can be admitted, but &s;uch who&s;e Circum&s;tances are, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, alike, and &s;o Mankind mu&s;t be <HI>&s;orted</HI> into Cla&s;&s;es; and as their Contingences differ, every dif|ferent Sort may be a Society upon even Terms; for the Circum&s;tances of Peo|ple,
<PB N="119" REF="134">
as to Life, differ extremely by the Age and Con&s;titution of their Bodies, and difference of Employment; as he that lives on &s;hore, again&s;t him that goes to Sea, or a Young Man again&s;t an Old Man; or a Shopkeeper again&s;t a Soldier, are unequal; I don't pretend to deter|mine the Controverted Point of Pre|de&s;tination, the Foreknowledge and De|crees of Providence; perhaps, if a Man be Decreed to be Kill'd in the Trenches, the &s;ame Foreknowledge Order'd him to Li&s;t him&s;elf a Soldier that it might come to pa&s;s; and the like of a Sea|man; but this I am &s;ure, &s;peaking of Second Cau&s;es, a Seaman or a Soldier is &s;ubject to more contingent hazards than other Men, and therefore are not upon equal Terms to form &s;uch a So|ciety; nor is an Annuity on the Life of &s;uch a Man worth &s;o much as it is upon other Men; therefore if a So|ciety &s;hou'd agree together to Pay the
<PB N="120" REF="135">
Executor of every Member &s;o much after the Decea&s;e of the &s;aid Mem|ber, the Seamens Executors wou'd mo&s;t certainly have an Advantage, and receive more than they Pay. So that 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ort the World in|to Parcels, Seamen with Seamen, Sol|diers with Soldiers, and the like.</P>
<P>Nor is this a new thing; the <HI>Friendly Society</HI> mu&s;t not pretend to a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Contrivance of the Me|thod, or think us guilty of borrowing from them, when we draw this into other Branches; for I know nothing is taken from them but the bare word, <HI>Friendly-Society,</HI> which they cannot pre|tend to be any con&s;iderable piece of Invention neither.</P>
<P>I can refer them to the very indivi|dual Practice in other things, which claims pre&s;cription beyond the begin|ing of the la&s;t Age, and that is in our Mar&s;hes and Fens in <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Kent,</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="136">
and the <HI>I&s;le of Ely;</HI> where great Quantities of Land being with much Pains and a va&s;t Charge recovered out of the Seas and Rivers, and maintain'd with Banks (which they call Walls) the Owners of tho&s;e Lands agree to Contribute to the keeping up tho&s;e Walls, and keeping out the Sea, which is all one with a <HI>Friendly-Society;</HI> and if I have a Piece of Land in any Level or Mar&s;h, tho' it bounds no where on the Sea or Ri|ver, yet I pay my Proportion to the Maintenance of the &s;aid Wall or Bank; and if at any time the Sea breaks in, the Damage is not laid up|on the Man in who&s;e Land the Breach happened, unle&s;s it was by his neglect, but it lies on the whole Land, and is called a <HI>Level-Lot.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I have known it practi&s;ed in Troops of Hor&s;e, e&s;pecially when it was &s;o order'd that the Troopers
<PB N="122" REF="137">
Mounted them&s;elves; where every pri|vate Trooper has agreed to Pay, per|haps, 2 <HI>d. per diem</HI> out of his Pay into a Publick Stock, which Stock was employed to Remount any of the Troop who by Accident &s;hou'd lo&s;e his Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, The Sailors Contribution to the Che&s;t at <HI>Chatham,</HI> is another <HI>Friendly-Society;</HI> and more might be nam'd.</P>
<P>To argue again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of this, wou'd be to cry down common Equity, as well as Charity; for as 'tis kind that my Neighbour &s;hou'd Re|lieve me if I fall into Di&s;tre&s;s or De|cay; &s;o 'tis but Equal he &s;hou'd do &s;o if I agreed to have done the &s;ame for him; and if God Almighty has Com|manded us to Relieve and Help one another in Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ure it mu&s;t be commendable to bind our &s;elves by Agreement to Obey that Command;
<PB N="123" REF="138">
nay, it &s;eems to be a Project that we are led to by the Divine Rule, and has &s;uch a Latitude in it, that, for ought I know, as I &s;aid, all the Di&s;|a&s;ters in the World might be prevent|ed by it, and Mankind be &s;ecur'd from all the Mi&s;eries, Indigences, and Di|&s;tre&s;&s;es that happen in the World. In which I crave leave to be a little Par|ticular.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, General Peace might be &s;e|cur'd all over the World by it, if all the Powers agreed to &s;uppre&s;s him that U&s;urp'd or Encroach'd upon his Neighbour. All the Contingences of Life might be fenc'd again&s;t by this Method, (as Fire is already) as Thieves, Floods by Land, Storms by Sea, Lo&s;&s;es of all Sorts, and Death it &s;elf, in a manner, by making it up to the Survivor.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the Seamen; for as their Lives are &s;ubject to more ha|zards
<PB N="124" REF="139">
than others, they &s;eem to come fir&s;t in view.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of Seamen.</HEAD>
<P>Sailors are <HI>Les Enfans Perdue,</HI> the <HI>Forlorn hope of the World;</HI> they are Fellows that bid Defiance to Terror, and maintain a con&s;tant War with the Elements; who by the Magick of their Art, Trade in the very confines of Death, and are always po&s;ted within &s;hot, as I may &s;ay, of the Grave: 'Tis true, their familiarity with Danger makes them de&s;pi&s;e it, for which, I hope, no body will &s;ay they are the wi&s;er; and Cu&s;tom has &s;o harden'd them, that we find them the wor&s;t of Men, tho' always in view of their la&s;t Mo|ment.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erv'd one great Error in the Cu&s;tom of <HI>England,</HI> relating
<PB N="125" REF="140">
to the&s;e &s;ort of People, and which this way of <HI>Friendly-Society</HI> wou'd be a Remedy for.</P>
<P>If a Seaman who Enters him&s;elf, or is Pre&s;s'd into the King's Ser|vice, be by any Accident Wound|ed or Di&s;abled, to Recompence him for the Lo&s;s, he receives a Pen&s;ion during Life, which the Sail|ors call <HI>Smart-Money,</HI> and is pro|portioned to their Hurt, as for the Lo&s;s of an Eye, Arm, Leg, or Finger, and the like; and as 'tis a very Honourable thing, &s;o 'tis but rea&s;onable, That a Poor Man who Lo&s;es his Limbs (which are his E&s;tate) in the Service of the Government, and is thereby di&s;a|bled from his Labour to get his Bread, &s;hou'd be provided for, and not &s;uffer'd to Beg or Starve for want of tho&s;e Limbs he lo&s;t in the Service of his Country.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="141">
But if you come to the Sea|men in the Merchants Service, not the lea&s;t Provi&s;ion is made; which has been the Lo&s;s of many a good Ship, with many a Rich Cargo, which wou'd otherwi&s;e have been Sav'd.</P>
<P>And the Sailors are in the Right of it too: <HI>For In&s;tance;</HI> A Merchant Ship coming home from the <HI>Indies,</HI> perhaps very Rich, meets with a Privateer (not &s;o Strong but that She might Fight him, and perhaps get off); the Captain calls up his Crew, tells them, <HI>Gentlemen, You &s;ee how 'tis, I don't que&s;tion but we may Clear our &s;elves of this Caper, if you will Stand by Me.</HI> One of the Crew, as willing to Fight as the re&s;t, and as far from a Coward as the Captain, but endow'd with a little more Wit than his Fellows, Replies, <HI>Noble Captain, We are all willing to Fight, and don't que&s;tion but to Beat him</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="142">
<HI>off; but here is the Ca&s;e, If we are Taken, we &s;hall be &s;et on Shore, and then &s;ent Home, and Lo&s;e, perhaps, our Cloaths, and a little Pay; but if we Fight and Beat the Privateer, perhaps Half a Score of us may be Wounded and Lo&s;e our Limbs, and then we are Undone and our Families; if you will Sign an Obligation to us, That the Owners, or Merchants, &s;hall al|low a Pen&s;ion to &s;uch as are Maim'd, that we may not Fight for the Ship, and go a Begging our &s;elves, we will bring off the Ship, or Sink by her &s;ide, otherwi&s;e I am not willing to Fight, for my part.</HI> The Captain cannot do this; &s;o they Strike, and the Ship and Cargo is Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>If I &s;hou'd turn this &s;uppos'd Ex|ample into a real Hi&s;tory, and Name the Ship and the Captain that did &s;o, it wou'd be too plain to be contradicted.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="143">
Wherefore, for the Encouragement of Sailors in the Service of the Merchant, I wou'd have a <HI>Friendly-Society</HI> Erected for Seamen; where|in all Sailors, or Seafaring-men, Entring their Names, Places of Abode, and the Voyages they go upon, at an <HI>Office of En&s;urance for Seamen,</HI> and Paying there a cer|tain &s;mall Quarteridge, of 1 <HI>s. per</HI> Quarter, &s;hou'd have a Seal'd Cer|tificate from the Governors of the &s;aid Office, for the Articles hereafter mentioned.</P>

<P>Suppo&s;e an Office to be Erected, to be call'd <HI>An Office of En&s;urance for Wi|dows,</HI> upon the following Condi|tions:</P>
<P>Two thou&s;and Women, or their Husbands for them, Enter their Names into a Regi&s;ter to be kept for that purpo&s;e, with the Names,
<PB N="134" REF="149">
Age, and Trade of their Husbands, with the Place of their Abode, Paying at the time of their Entring 5 <HI>s.</HI> down with 1 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d. per</HI> Quarter, which is to the &s;etting up and &s;upport of an Office with Clerks, and all proper Officers for the &s;ame; <HI>for there is no main|taining &s;uch without Charge;</HI> they receive every one of them a Certifi|cate, Seal'd by the Secretary of the Office, and Sign'd by the Governors, for the Articles hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P>If any one of the Women become a Widow at any time after Six Months from the Date of her Sub&s;cription, upon due Notice given, and Claim made at the Office in form, as &s;hall be directed, &s;he &s;hall receive within Six Months after &s;uch Claim made, the Sum of 500 <HI>l.</HI> in Money, without any Deductions, &s;aving &s;ome &s;mall Fees to the Officers, which the Tru|&s;tees
<PB N="135" REF="150">
mu&s;t &s;ettle, that they may be known.</P>
<P>In Con&s;ideration of this, every Woman &s;o Sub&s;cribing, Obliges her &s;elf to Pay as often as any Member of the Society becomes a Widow, the due Proportion or Share allotted to her to Pay, towards the 500 <HI>l.</HI> for the &s;aid Widow, provided her Share does not exceed the Sum of 5 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>No Seaman or Soldiers Wives to be accepted into &s;uch a Propo&s;al as this, on the account before-mention'd, becau&s;e the Contingences of their Lives are not equal to others, unle&s;s they will admit this general Exception, &s;uppo&s;ing they do not Die out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>It might al&s;o be an Exception, That if the Widow, that Claim'd, had really, <HI>bona fide,</HI> left her by her Hu&s;|band to her own u&s;e, clear of all Debts and Legacies, 2000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;he
<PB N="136" REF="151">
&s;hou'd have no Claim; the Intent be|ing to Aid the Poor, not add to the Rich. But there lies a great many Objections again&s;t &s;uch an Article: As<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) It may tempt &s;ome to For|&s;wear them&s;elves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) People will Order their Wills &s;o as to Defraud the Exception.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>One Exception mu&s;t be made; and that is, Either very Unequal Matches, as when a Woman of Nineteen Mar|ries an Old Man of Seventy; or Women who have Infirm Husbands, I mean known and publickly &s;o. To remedy which, Two things are to be done.<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) The Office mu&s;t have moving Officers without doors, who &s;hall in|form them&s;elves of &s;uch matters, and if any &s;uch Circum&s;tances appear, the Office &s;hou'd have 14 days time to re|turn their Money, and declare their Sub&s;criptions Void.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="137" REF="152">
(2.) No Woman who&s;e Husband had any vi&s;ible Di&s;temper, &s;hou'd claim under a Year after her Sub|&s;cription.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>One grand Objection again&s;t this Propo&s;al, is, How you will oblige People to Pay either their Sub&s;cripti|on, or their Quarteridge.</P>
<P>To this I An&s;wer, <HI>By no compul|&s;ion</HI> (tho' that might be perform'd too) but altogether voluntary; only with this Argument to move it, that if they do not continue their Pay|ments, they lo&s;e the Benefit of their pa&s;t Contributions.</P>
<P>I know it lies as a fair Objection again&s;t &s;uch a Project as this, That the number of Claims are &s;o uncertain, That no Body knows what they en|gage in, when they Sub&s;cribe, for &s;o many may Die Annually out of Two thou&s;and, as may make my Payment 20 or 25 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and if a Woman
<PB N="138" REF="153">
happen to Pay that for Twenty Years, though &s;he receives the 500 <HI>l.</HI> at la&s;t &s;he is a great Lo&s;er; but if &s;he dies before her Husband, &s;he has le&s;|&s;ened his E&s;tate con&s;iderably, and brought a great Lo&s;s upon him.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;ay to this, That I wou'd have &s;uch a Propo&s;al as this be &s;o fair and &s;o ea&s;y, that if any Per&s;on who had Sub&s;crib'd, found the Payments too high, and the Claims fall too of|ten, it &s;hou'd be at their liberty at any time, upon Notice given, to be Re|lea&s;ed, and &s;tand Oblig'd no longer; and if &s;o, <HI>Volenti non fit injuria;</HI> every one knows be&s;t what their own Cir|cum&s;tances will bear.</P>
<P>In the next Place, becau&s;e Death is a Contingency, no Man can directly calculate, and all that Sub&s;cribe mu&s;t take the hazard; yet that a Prejudice again&s;t this Notion may not be built on wrong grounds, let's examine a little the
<PB N="139" REF="154">
probable hazard, and &s;ee how many &s;hall die Annually out of 2000 Sub|&s;cribers, accounting by the common proportion of Burials, to the number of the Living.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> in his <HI>Political Arithmetick,</HI> by a very Ingenious Cal|culation, brings the account of Buri|als in <HI>London,</HI> to be 1 in 40 Annually, and proves it by all the proper Rules of proportion'd Computation; and I'le take my Scheme from thence.</P>
<P>If then One in Forty of all the People in <HI>England</HI> Die, that &s;up|po&s;es Fifty to Die every Year out of our Two Thou&s;and Sub&s;cribers; and for a Woman to Contribute 5 <HI>s.</HI> to every one, wou'd certainly be to Agree to Pay 12 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> upon her Husband's Life, to receive 500 <HI>l.</HI> when he Di'd, and lo&s;e it if &s;he Di'd fir&s;t; and yet this wou'd not be a Ha|zard beyond rea&s;on too great for the Gain.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="155">
But I &s;hall offer &s;ome Rea&s;ons to prove this to be impo&s;&s;ible in our Ca&s;e; Fir&s;t, Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> allows the City of <HI>London</HI> to contain about a Million of People, and our Yearly Bill of Mortality never yet amounted to 25000 in the mo&s;t Sickly Years we have had, Plague Years excepted, &s;ometimes but to 20000, which is but One in Fifty: Now it is to be con&s;i|der'd here, that Children and Ancient People make up, one time with ano|ther, at lea&s;t one third of our Bills of Mortality; and our <HI>A&s;&s;urances</HI> lies upon none but the Midling Age of the People, which is the only Age wherein Life is any thing &s;teady; and if that be allow'd, there cannot Die by his Computation, above One in Eighty of &s;uch People every Year; but becau&s;e I wou'd be &s;ure to leave room for Ca&s;ualty, I'le allow One in Fifty &s;hall Die out of our Number Sub|&s;crib'd.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="156">
Secondly, It mu&s;t be allow'd, that our Payments falling due only on the Death of Husbands, this One in Fifty mu&s;t not be reckoned upon the Two thou&s;and; for 'tis to be &s;uppos'd at lea&s;t as many Women &s;hall Die as Men, and then there is nothing to Pay; &s;o that One in Fifty upon One Thou&s;and, is the mo&s;t that I can &s;up|po&s;e &s;hall Claim the Contribution in a Year, which is Twenty Claims a Year, at 5 <HI>s.</HI> each, and is 5 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and if a Woman Pays this for Twenty Year, and Claims at la&s;t, &s;he is Gainer enough, and no extraordinary Lo&s;er if &s;he never Claims at all: And I verily believe any Office might Un|dertake to Demand at all Adventures not above 6 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and &s;ecure the Sub&s;criber 500 <HI>l.</HI> in ca&s;e &s;he come to Claim as a Widow.</P>
<P>I forbear being more particular on this Thought, having occa&s;ion to be
<PB N="142" REF="157">
larger in other Prints; the Experiment being re&s;olv'd upon by &s;ome Friends, who are pleas'd to think this too u&s;eful a Project not to be put in execution; and therefore I refer the Reader to the Publick Practice of it.</P>
<P>I have nam'd the&s;e two Ca&s;es as &s;pe|cial Experiments of what might be done by A&s;&s;urances in way of <HI>Friend|ly Society;</HI> and I believe I might without Arrogance affirm, That the &s;ame Thought might be improv'd in|to Methods that &s;hou'd prevent the General Mi&s;ery and Poverty of Man|kind, and at once &s;ecure us again&s;t Beggars, Pari&s;h-Poor, Alms-Hou&s;es, and Ho&s;pitals; and by which, not a Creature &s;o Mi&s;erable, or &s;o Poor, but &s;hould claim Sub&s;i&s;tence as their Due, and not ask it of Charity.</P>
<P>I cannot believe any Creature &s;o wretchedly ba&s;e, as to Beg of mere
<PB N="143" REF="158">
choice, but either it mu&s;t proceed from Want, or &s;ordid prodigious Covetou&s;ne&s;s; and thence I affirm, There can be no <HI>Beggar,</HI> but he ought to be either Reliev'd, or Puni&s;h'd, or both. If a man begs for mere Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, without Want, 'tis a ba&s;ene&s;s of Soul &s;o extremely &s;ordid, as ought to be us'd with the utmo&s;t Contempt, and puni&s;h'd with the Correction due to a Dog. If he begs for Want, that Want is procur'd by Slothfulne&s;s and Idlene&s;s, or by Accident; if the latter, he ought to be reliev'd; if the for|mer, he ought to be puni&s;h'd for the Cau&s;e, but at the &s;ame time reliev'd al&s;o; for no man ought to &s;tarve, let his Crime be what it will.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed therefore to a Scheme, by which all Mankind, be he never &s;o mean, &s;o poor, &s;o unable, &s;hall gain for him&s;elf a Ju&s;t Claim to a comforta|ble Sub&s;i&s;tence, when&s;oever Age or
<PB N="144" REF="159">
Ca&s;ualty &s;hall reduce him to a nece&s;|&s;ity of making u&s;e of it. There is a Poverty &s;o far from being De&s;picable, that 'tis Honourable, when a man by direct Ca&s;ualty, &s;udden Providence, and without any procuring of his own, is reduc'd to want Relief from others, as by Fire, Shipwreck, Lo&s;s of Limbs, and the like.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ometimes &s;o apparent, that they command the Charity of others; but there are al&s;o many Fa|milies reduc'd to Decay, who&s;e Con|ditions are not &s;o publick, and yet their Nece&s;&s;ities as great. Innumera|ble Circum&s;tances reduce men to want; and pre&s;&s;ing Poverty oblige &s;ome people to make their Ca&s;es pub|lick, or &s;tarve; and from thence came the Cu&s;tom of Begging, which Sloth and Idlene&s;s has improv'd into a Trade. But the Method I propo&s;e, thoroughly put in practice, would remove the
<PB N="145" REF="160">
Cau&s;e, and the Effect wou'd cea&s;e of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Want of Con&s;ideration is the great rea&s;on why People do not provide in their Youth and Strength for Old Age and Sickne&s;s; and the en&s;uing Propo&s;al is, in &s;hort, only this, That all Per&s;ons in the time of their Health and Youth, while they are able to Work and &s;pare it, &s;hou'd lay up &s;ome &s;mall incon&s;iderable part of their gettings as a depo&s;it in &s;afe hands, to lie as a Store in bank to relieve them, if by Age or Accident they come to be di&s;|abled, or uncapable to Provide for them&s;elves; and that if God &s;o Ble&s;s them, that they nor theirs never come to need it, the overplus may be em|ploy'd to relieve &s;uch as &s;hall.</P>
<P>If an Office in the &s;ame nature with this, were appointed in every
<PB N="146" REF="161">
County in <HI>England,</HI> I doubt not but Poverty might ea&s;ily be prevented, and Begging wholly &s;uppres'd.</P>

<P>WAGERING, as now pra|ctis'd by Polities and Con|tracts, is become a Branch of <HI>A&s;&s;u|rances;</HI> it was before more properly a part of Gaming, and as it de&s;erv'd, had but a very low e&s;teem; but
<PB N="172" REF="187">
&s;hifting &s;ides, and the War providing proper &s;ubjects, as the contingences of Sieges, Battles, Treaties, and Campaigns, it encreas'd to an extraordinary Repu|tation, and Offices were erected on purpo&s;e which manag'd it to a &s;trange degree and with great Advantage, e&s;pecially to the Office-keepers; &s;o that as has been computed, there was not le&s;s Gaged on one &s;ide and other upon the &s;econd Siege of <HI>Limerick,</HI> than Two hundred thou&s;and Pound.</P>
<P>How 'tis manag'd, and by what trick and artifice it became a Trade, and how in&s;en&s;ibly Men were drawn into it, an ea&s;y Account may be given.</P>
<P>I believe <HI>Novelty</HI> was the fir&s;t wheel that &s;et it on work, and I need make no reflection upon the power of that Charm: It was wholly a new thing, at lea&s;t upon the <HI>Exchange</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> and the fir&s;t occa&s;ion that gave
<PB N="173" REF="188">
it a room among publick Di&s;cour&s;e, was &s;ome Per&s;ons forming Wagers on the Return and Succe&s;s of King <HI>James,</HI> for which the Government took occa|&s;ion to u&s;e them as they de&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>I <HI>have</HI> heard a Book&s;eller in King <HI>James</HI>'s time &s;ay, <HI>That if he wou'd have a Book &s;ell, he wou'd have it Burnt by the hand of the Common Hangman;</HI> the Man, no doubt, valu'd his Profit above his Reputation; but People are &s;o addicted to pro&s;ecute a thing that &s;eems forbid, that this very practice &s;eem'd to be encourag'd by its being <HI>Contraband.</HI></P>
<P>The Trade encreas'd, and fir&s;t on the <HI>Exchange</HI> and then in Coffee-hou&s;es it got life, till the Brokers, <HI>tho&s;e Ver|min of Trade,</HI> got hold of it, and then particular Offices were &s;et apart for it, and an incredible re&s;ort thi|ther was to be &s;een every day.</P>
<P>The&s;e Offices had not been long in
<PB N="174" REF="189">
being, but they were throng'd with <HI>Sharpers</HI> and <HI>Setters</HI> as much as the Groom-Porter's, or any Gaming-Or|dinary in Town, where a Man had nothing to do, but to make a good Figure and prepare the Keeper of the Office to give him a Credit as a good Man, and though he had not a Groat to pay, he &s;hou'd take Guineas and &s;ign Polities, till he had receiv'd, perhaps 3 or 400 <HI>l.</HI> in Money on condition to pay great Odds, and then Succe&s;s tries the Man; if he Wins, his Fortune is made; if not, he's a better Man than he was before, by ju&s;t &s;o much Mo|ney, for as to the Debt, he is your Humble Servant in the <HI>Temple</HI> or <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>But be&s;ides tho&s;e who are but the Thieves of the Trade, there is a Me|thod as effectual to get Money as po&s;|&s;ible, manag'd with more appearing Hone&s;ty, but no le&s;s Art, by which
<PB N="175" REF="190">
the Wagerer, in Confederacy with the Office-keeper, &s;hall lay va&s;t Sums, great Odds, and yet be always &s;ure to Win.</P>
<P><HI>For Example:</HI></P>
<P>A Town in <HI>Flanders,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, during the War is be&s;ieg'd; perhaps at the beginning of the Siege the De|fence is vigorous, and Relief probable, and it is the opinion of mo&s;t people, the Town will hold out <HI>&s;o long,</HI> or perhaps not be taken at all: The Wa|gerer has two or three more of his fort in conjunction, of which always the Office-keeper is one; and they run down all di&s;cour&s;e of the taking the Town, and offer great Odds it &s;hall not be taken by &s;uch a day: Perhaps this goes on a Week, and then the Scale turns; and tho' they &s;eem to hold the &s;ame opinion &s;till, yet under|hand the Office-keeper has Orders to Take all the Odds which by their Ex|ample
<PB N="176" REF="191">

Here I &s;uppo&s;e 1500 Pounds <HI>per Ann.</HI> Revenue, to be &s;ettl'd upon the Hou&s;e, which 'tis very probable might be rais'd from the Tax afore|&s;aid. But &s;ince an Act of Parliament is nece&s;&s;ary to be had for the Collecting this Duty, <HI>and that Taxes for keeping of Fools would be difficultly obtain'd, while they are &s;o much wanted for Wi&s;e Men;</HI> I would propo&s;e to rai&s;e the Money by voluntary Charity, which wou'd be a Work would leave more Honour to the Undertakers, than Fea&s;ts and great Shows, which our Publick Bodies too much dimini&s;h their Stocks with.</P>
<P>But to pa&s;s all &s;uppo&s;itious ways, which are ea&s;ily thought of, but hard|ly procur'd; I propo&s;e to maintain Fools out of our own Folly: And whereas a great deal of Money has been thrown about in Lotteries, the following Propo&s;al would very ea&s;ily perfect our Work.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="200"><HI>A Charity-Lottery.</HI></P>
<P>That a Lottery be &s;et up by the Authority of the Lord-Mayor and Court of Aldermen, for a Hundred thou&s;and Tickets, at Twenty Shillings each, to be drawn by the known Way and Method of drawing Lotteries, as the Million-Lottery was drawn; in which no Allowance to be made to any body; but the Fortunate to re|ceive the full Sum of One hundred thou&s;and Pounds put in, without Di&s;count; and yet this double Advan|tage to follow:<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) That an immediate Sum of One hundred thou&s;and Pounds &s;hall be rais'd and paid into the <HI>Exchequer</HI> for the Publick U&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) A Sum of above Twenty thou&s;and Pounds be gain'd, to be put into the hands of known Tru&s;tees, to
<PB N="186" REF="201">
be laid out in a Charity for the Main|tenance of the Poor.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>That as &s;oon as the Money &s;hall be come in, it &s;hall be paid into the <HI>Ex|chequer,</HI> either on &s;ome good Fund, if any &s;uitable, or on the Credit of <HI>Ex|chequer;</HI> and that when the Lot|tery is drawn, the Fortunate to receive Tallies or Bills from the <HI>Exchequer</HI> for their Money, payable at Four Years.</P>
<P>The <HI>Exchequer</HI> receives this Money, and gives out Tallies according to the Prizes, when 'tis drawn, all payable at Four Years; and the Intere&s;t of this Money for Four Years is &s;truck in Tal|lies proportion'd to the time, and gi|ven to the Tru&s;tees; which is the Pro|fit I propo&s;e for the Work.</P>
<P>Thus the Fortunate have an imme|diate Title to their Prizes, at Four Years, without Intere&s;t; and the Ho|&s;pital will have al&s;o an immediate Title to 6000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for Four
<PB N="187" REF="202">
Years, which is the Intere&s;t at 6 <HI>per Cent. per Ann.</HI></P>
<P>If any &s;hould object again&s;t the Time of &s;taying for their Prizes, it &s;hould be an&s;wer'd thus, That who|ever did not like to &s;tay the Time for the Money, upon di&s;counting Four Years Intere&s;t at 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> &s;hould have their Money down.</P>
<P>I think this Specimen will inform any body what might be done by Lot|teries, were they not hackney'd about in Private Hands, who by Fraud and Ill Management put them out of Re|pute, and &s;o neither gain them&s;elves, nor &s;uffer any u&s;eful hand&s;ome De&s;ign to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>'Twould be needle&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, to mention, That &s;uch a Propo&s;al as this ought to be &s;et on foot by Publick Approbation, and by Men of known Integrity and E&s;tates, that there may be no room left for a &s;u&s;picion of private advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="203">
If this or any equivalent Propo&s;al &s;ucceeded to rai&s;e the Money, I would have the Hou&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h'd as afore&s;aid, with larger or &s;maller Revenues, as nece&s;&s;ity oblig'd; then the Per&s;ons to be receiv'd &s;hould be without di&s;tincti|on or re&s;pect, but principally &s;uch as were really Poor and Friendle&s;s; and any that were kept already by any Pa|ri&s;h-Collection, the &s;aid Pari&s;h &s;hould allow Forty Shillings Yearly towards their Maintenance; which no Pari&s;h would refu&s;e that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted them whol|ly before.</P>
<P>I make no que&s;tion but that if &s;uch an Ho&s;pital was erected within a Mile or two of the City, one great Circum|&s;tance would happen, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the common &s;ort of people, who are ve|ry much addicted to rambling in the Fields, would make this Hou&s;e the cu&s;tomary Walk, to divert them&s;elves with the Objects to be &s;een there, and
<PB N="189" REF="204">
to make what they call Sport with the Calamity of others; as is now &s;hame|fully allow'd in <HI>Bedlam.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent this, and that the con|dition of &s;uch, which de&s;erves Pity, not Contempt, might not be the more expos'd by this Charity, it &s;hould be order'd, That the Steward of the Hou&s;e be in Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace within the Precincts of the Hou&s;e only, and authoriz'd to puni&s;h by limited Fines, or otherwi&s;e, any per&s;on that &s;hall offer any Abu&s;e to the poor Alms|people, or &s;hall offer to make Sport at their Condition.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on at Reading of this, &s;hou'd be &s;o impertinent as to ask, To what purpo&s;e I wou'd appoint a Chaplain in an Ho&s;pital of <HI>Fools?</HI> I could an&s;wer him very well, by &s;ay|ing, For the u&s;e of the other Per&s;ons, Officers and Attendants in the Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>THis Chapter has &s;ome Right to &s;tand next to that of Fools; for be&s;ides the common acceptation of late, which makes <HI>every Unfortu|nate Man a Fool,</HI> I think no man &s;o much made a Fool of as a <HI>Bankrupt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="207">
If I may be allow'd &s;o much li|berty with our Laws, which are gene|rally good, and above all things are temper'd with Mercy, Lenity, and Freedom, This has &s;omething in it of Barbarity; it gives a loo&s;e to the Ma|lice and Revenge of the Creditor, as well as a Power to right him&s;elf, while it leaves the Debtor no way to &s;how him&s;elf hone&s;t: It contrives all the ways po&s;&s;ible to drive the Debtor to de&s;pair, and encourages no new In|du&s;try, for it makes him perfectly un|capable of any thing but <HI>&s;tarving.</HI></P>
<P>This Law, e&s;pecially as it is now frequently executed, tends wholly to the De&s;truction of the Debtor, and yet very little to the Ad|vantage of the Creditor.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Severities to the Debtor are unrea&s;onable, and, if I may &s;o &s;ay, a little inhuman; for it not only &s;trips him of all in a moment, but
<PB N="193" REF="208">
renders him for ever incapable of help|ing him&s;elf, or relieving his Family by future Indu&s;try. If he '&s;capes from Pri|&s;on, which is hardly done too, if he has nothing left, he mu&s;t &s;tarve, or live on Charity; if he goes to work, no man dare pay him his Wages, but he &s;hall pay it again to the Creditors; if he has any private Stock left for a Sub&s;i&s;tence, he can put it no where; every man is bound to be a Thief, and take it from him: If he tru&s;ts it in the hands of a Friend, he mu&s;t receive it again as a great Courte&s;y, for that Friend is liable to account for it. I have known a poor man pro&s;ecuted by a Statute to that degree, that all he had left was a little Money, which he knew not where to hide; at la&s;t, that he might not &s;tarve, he gives it to his Brother, who had entertain'd him; the Brother, after he had his Money, quarrels with him to get him out of
<PB N="194" REF="209">
his Hou&s;e; and when he de&s;ires him to let him have the Money lent him, gives him this for An&s;wer, <HI>I cannot pay you &s;afely, for there is a Statute again&s;t you;</HI> which run the poor man to &s;uch Extremities, that he de&s;troy'd him&s;elf. Nothing is more frequent, than for men who are reduc'd by Mi&s;carriage in Trade, to Compound and Set up again, and get good E&s;tates; but a <HI>Statute,</HI> as we call it, for ever &s;huts up all doors to the Debtor's Recovery; as if Breaking were a Crime &s;o Capital, that he ought to be ca&s;t out of Hu|man Society, and expos'd to Extremi|ties wor&s;e than Death. And, which will further expo&s;e the fruitle&s;s Severity of this Law, 'tis ea&s;y to make it ap|pear, That all this Cruelty to the Debtor is &s;o far (generally &s;peaking) from advantaging the Creditors, that it de&s;troys the E&s;tate, con&s;umes it in extravagant Charges, and unle&s;s the
<PB N="195" REF="210">
Debtor be con&s;enting, &s;eldom makes any con&s;iderable Dividends. And I am bold to &s;ay, There is no Advan|tage made by the pro&s;ecuting of a Statute with Severity, but what might be doubly made by Methods more merciful. And tho' I am not to pre|&s;cribe to the Legi&s;lators of the Nation, yet by way of E&s;&s;ay I take leave to give my Opinion and my Experience in the Methods, Con&s;equences, and Remedies of this Law.</P>
<P>All people know, who remember any thing of the Times when that Law was made, that the Evil it was point|ed at, was grown very rank, and Break|ing to defraud Creditors &s;o much a Trade, that the Parliament had good rea&s;on to &s;et up a Fury to deal with it; and I am far from reflecting on the Makers of that Law, who, no que&s;ti|on, &s;aw 'twas nece&s;&s;ary at that time: But as Laws, tho' in them&s;elves good,
<PB N="196" REF="211">
are more or le&s;s &s;o, as they are more or le&s;s &s;ea&s;onable, &s;quar'd, and adapt|ed to the Circum&s;tances and Time of the Evil they are made again&s;t; &s;o 'twere worth while (with Submi&s;&s;ion) for the &s;ame Authority to examine:<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) Whether the Length of Time &s;ince that Act was made, has not gi|ven opportunity to Debtors,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To evade the Force of the Act by Ways and Shifts to avoid the Power of it, and &s;ecure their E|&s;tates out of the reach of it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To turn the Point of it again&s;t tho&s;e whom it was made to re|lieve? Since we &s;ee frequently now, that Bankrupts de&s;ire Statutes, and procure them to be taken out a|gain&s;t them&s;elves.</ITEM>

(2.) Whether the Extremities of this Law are not often carried on be|yond the true Intent and Meaning of the Act it &s;elf, by Per&s;ons, who be|&s;ides
<PB N="197" REF="212">
being Creditors, are al&s;o Malici|ous, and gratify their private Revenge, by pro&s;ecuting the Offender, to the Ruin of his Family.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If the&s;e Two Points are to be prov'd, then I am &s;ure 'twill follow, That this Act is now a Publick Grievance to the Nation; and I doubt not but will be one time or other repeal'd by the &s;ame Wi&s;e Authority which made it.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Time and Experience has fur|ni&s;h'd the Debtors with Ways and Means to evade the Force of this Sta|tute, and to &s;ecure their E&s;tate again&s;t the reach of it; which renders it often in&s;ignificant, and con&s;equently, the Knave, again&s;t whom the Law was particularly bent, gets off; while he only who fails of mere Nece&s;&s;ity, and who&s;e hone&s;t Principle will not permit him to practice tho&s;e Methods, is ex|pos'd to the Fury of this Act: And as things are now order'd, nothing is
<PB N="198" REF="213">
more ea&s;y, than for a man to order his E&s;tate &s;o, that a Statute &s;hall have no power over it, or at lea&s;t but a little.</P>
<P>If the Bankrupt be a Merchant, no Statute can reach his Effects beyond the Seas; &s;o that he has nothing to &s;e|cure but his Books, and away he goes into the <HI>Friars.</HI> If a Shopkeeper, he has more difficulty; but that is made ea&s;y, for there are Men (and Carts) to be had, <HI>who&s;e Trade it is,</HI> and who in One Night &s;hall remove the greate&s;t Warehou&s;e of Goods, or Cellar of Wines in the Town, and carry them off into tho&s;e Nur&s;eries of Rogues, the <HI>Mint</HI> and <HI>Friars;</HI> and our Con&s;ta|bles and Watch, who are the allow'd-Magi&s;trates of the Night, and who &s;hall &s;top a poor little lurking Thief, that it may be has &s;tole a bundle of old Cloaths, worth 5 <HI>s.</HI> &s;hall let them all pa&s;s without any di&s;turbance, and

Prithee, What need you care for a Sta|tute? A Thou&s;and Statutes can't reach you here.</HI> This is the <HI>Language of the Countrey,</HI> and the New Comer &s;oon learns to &s;peak it; (for I think I may &s;ay, without wronging any man, I have known many a man go in a|mong them Hone&s;t, that is, without Ill De&s;ign, but I never knew one come away &s;o again.)&mdash;Then comes a Graver Sort among this Black Crew, (for here, as in Hell, are Fiends of Degrees, and different Magnitude),
<PB N="201" REF="216">
and he falls into Di&s;cour&s;e with the New Comer, and gives him more &s;o|lid Advice. <HI>Look you, Sir, I am con|cern'd to &s;ee you melancholly, I am in your Circum&s;tance too, and if you'll accept of it, I'le give you the be&s;t Advice I can;</HI> and &s;o begins the Grave Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The man is in too much trouble, not to want Coun&s;el, &s;o he thanks him, and he goes on: <HI>Send a Summons to your Creditors, and offer them what you can propo&s;e in the Pound</HI> (always re&s;er|ving a good Stock to begin the World again), <HI>which if they will take, you are a Freeman, and better than you were be|fore; if they won't take it, you know the wor&s;t of it, you are on the better &s;ide of the hedge with them: If they will not take it, but will proceed to a Statute, you have nothing to do, but to oppo&s;e Force with Force; for the Laws of Nature tell you, you mu&s;t not &s;tarve; and a Statute is &s;o</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="217">
<HI>barbarous, &s;o unju&s;t, &s;o malicious a way of proceeding again&s;t a man, that I do not think any Debtor oblig'd to con&s;ider any thing but his own Pre&s;ervation, when once they go on with that.&mdash;For why,</HI> &s;ays the old &s;tudi'd Wretch, <HI>&s;hould the Creditors &s;pend your E&s;tate in the Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and then demand the Debt of you too? Do you owe any thing to the Commi&s;|&s;ion of the Statute?</HI> (No, &s;ays he); <HI>Why then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I warrant their Charges will come to</HI> 200 l. <HI>out of your E&s;tate, and they mu&s;t have</HI> 10 s. <HI>a day for &s;tar|ving you and your Family. I cannot &s;ee why any man &s;hould think I am bound in Con&s;cience to pay the Extravagance of other men. If my Creditors &s;pend</HI> 500 l. <HI>in getting in my E&s;tate by a Statute, which I offer'd to &s;urrender without it, I'le reckon that</HI> 500 l. <HI>paid them, let them take it among them; for Equity is due to a Bankrupt as well as to any man; and if the Laws do not give it us, we mu&s;t take it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="218">
This is too rational Di&s;cour&s;e not to plea&s;e him, and he proceeds by this Advice; the Creditors cannot agree, but take out a Statute; and the man that offer'd at fir&s;t, it may be, 10 <HI>s.</HI> in the Pound, is kept in that cur&s;ed place till he has &s;pent it all, and can offer nothing, and then gets away beyond Sea, or after a long Con&s;umption gets off by an Act of Relief to poor Debtors, and all the Charges of the Statute falls among the Creditors. Thus I knew a Statute taken out a|gain&s;t a Shopkeeper in the Countrey, and a con&s;iderable Parcel of Goods too &s;eiz'd, and yet the Creditors, what with Charges, and two or three Suits at Law, lo&s;t their whole Debts, and 8 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound Contribution-Money for Charges; and the poor Debtor, like a man under the Surgeon's hand, died in the Operation.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="204" REF="219">
(2.) Another Evil that Time and Experience has brought to light from this Act, is, when the Debtor him&s;elf &s;hall confederate with &s;ome particular Creditor to take out a Statute; and this is a Ma&s;ter-piece of <HI>Plot</HI> and In|triegue: For perhaps &s;ome Creditor ho|ne&s;tly receiv'd in the way of Trade a large Sum of Money of the Debtor for Goods &s;old him when he was <HI>&s;ui juris;</HI> and he by con&s;ent &s;hall own him&s;elf a Bankrupt before that time, and the Statute &s;hall reach back to bring in an Hone&s;t Man's E&s;tate, to help pay a Rogue's Debt. Or a man &s;hall go and borrow a Sum of Money upon a Parcel of Goods, and lay them to Pledge; he keeps the Money, and the Statute &s;hall fetch away the Goods to help forward the Compo&s;ition. The&s;e are Tricks I can give too good an account of, having more than once &s;uffer'd by the Experiment. I could
<PB N="205" REF="220">
give a Scheme of more ways, but I think 'tis needle&s;s to prove the Nece&s;|&s;ity of laying a&s;ide that Law, which is pernicious to both Debtor and Cre|ditor, and chiefly hurtful to the Hone&s;t Man who it was made to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>The next Enquiry is, Whether the Extremities of this Law are not often carried on beyond the true Intent and Meaning of the Act it &s;elf, for Mali|cious and Private Ends, to gratify Pa&s;&s;ion and Revenge?</P>
<P>I remember the An&s;wer a Per&s;on gave me, who had taken out Statutes again&s;t &s;everal Per&s;ons, and &s;ome his near Relations, who had fail'd in his Debt; and when I was one time di&s;|&s;uading him from pro&s;ecuting a man who ow'd me Money as well as him, I us'd this Argument with him; <HI>You know the man has nothing left to pay. That's true,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I know that well enough. To what purpo&s;e then,</HI> &s;aid I,
<PB N="206" REF="221">
<HI>will you pro&s;ecute him? Why, Revenge is &s;weet,</HI> &s;aid he.&mdash;Now a man that will pro&s;ecute a Debtor, not as a Debtor, but by way of Revenge, &s;uch a man is, I think, not intentionally within the benefit of our Law.</P>
<P>In order to &s;tate the Ca&s;e right, there are four Sorts of People to be con&s;ider'd in this Di&s;cour&s;e; and the true Ca&s;e is how to di&s;tingui&s;h them.<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) There is the Hone&s;t Debtor, who fails by vi&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity, Lo&s;&s;es, Sickne&s;s, Decay of Trade, or the like.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) The Knavi&s;h, De&s;igning, or Idle, Extravagant Debtor, who fails becau&s;e either he has run out his E&s;tate in Exce&s;&s;es, or on purpo&s;e to cheat and abu&s;e his Creditors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) There is the moderate Credi|tor, who &s;eeks but his own, but will omit no lawful Means to gain
<PB N="207" REF="222">
it, and yet will hear rea&s;onable and ju&s;t Arguments and Propo&s;als.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) There is the Rigorous Severe Creditor, that values not whether the Debtor be Hone&s;t Man or Knave, Able, or Unable; but will have his Debt, <HI>whether it be to be had or no;</HI> without Mercy, without Compa&s;&s;ion, full of Ill Language, Pa&s;&s;ion, and Revenge.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>How to make a Law to &s;uit to all the&s;e, is the Ca&s;e: <HI>That a nece&s;&s;ary Favour might be &s;hown to the fir&s;t,</HI> in Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion to the Unfor|tunate, in Commi&s;eration of Ca&s;ual|ty and Poverty, which no man is ex|empt from the danger of. <HI>That a due Rigor and Re&s;traint be laid upon the &s;econd,</HI> that Villany and Knavery might not be encourag'd by a Law. <HI>That a due Care be taken of the third,</HI> that mens E&s;tates may, as far as can
<PB N="208" REF="223">
be, &s;ecur'd to them. <HI>And due Limits &s;et to the la&s;t,</HI> that no man may have an unlimited Power over his Fellow-Subjects, to the Ruin of both Life and E&s;tate.</P>
<P>All which I humbly conceive might be brought to pa&s;s by the following Method; to which I give the Title of</P>

<P>If the Sheriff be in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by <HI>fieri facias</HI> for Debt immediately due to the King, the Officer however &s;hall quit his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, and they &s;hall &s;ee the King's Debt fully &s;atisfied, before any Divi&s;ion be made to the Creditors.</P>

<P>It makes Conver&s;ation unplea&s;ant, at lea&s;t to tho&s;e who do not u&s;e the &s;ame fooli&s;h way of Di&s;cour&s;e; and indeed, is an Affront to all the Com|pany who &s;wear not as he does; for if I &s;wear and Cur&s;e in Company, I ei|ther pre&s;ume all the Company likes it, or affront them who do not.</P>
<P>Then 'tis <HI>fruitle&s;s;</HI> for no man is believ'd a jot the more for all the A&s;&s;e|verations, <HI>Damnings</HI> and Swearings he makes: Tho&s;e who are us'd to it them&s;elves, do not believe a man the more, becau&s;e they know they are &s;o cu&s;tomary, that they &s;igni|fy little to bind a man's Intenti|on;

<P>This is &s;ome of our new florid Language, and the Graces and Deli|cacies of Stile, which if it were put into <HI>Latin,</HI> I wou'd fain know which is the principal Verb.</P>
<P>But for a little further remembrance of this Impertinence, go among the Game&s;ters, and there nothing is more frequent than, <HI>God damn the Dice,</HI> or <HI>God damn the Bowls.</HI></P>

<P>'Tis true, Cu&s;tom is allow'd to be our be&s;t Authority for Words, and 'tis fit it &s;hould be &s;o; but Rea&s;on mu&s;t be the Judge of Sen&s;e in Language, and Cu&s;tom can never prevail over it. <HI>Words,</HI> indeed, like Ceremonies in Re|ligion, may be &s;ubmitted to the Ma|gi&s;trate; but <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> like the E&s;&s;entials, is po&s;itive, unalterable, and can|not be &s;ubmitted to any Juri&s;diction; 'tis a Law to it &s;elf, 'tis ever the &s;ame, even an Act of Parliament cannot al|ter it.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="259">
<HI>Words,</HI> and even U&s;ages in Stile, may be alter'd by Cu&s;tom, and Pro|prieties in Speech differ accord|ing to the &s;everal Dialects of the Countrey, and according to the dif|ferent manner in which &s;everal Lan|guages do &s;everally expre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But there is a direct Signification of Words, or a <HI>Cadence in Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> which we call &s;peaking <HI>Sen&s;e;</HI> this, like Truth, is &s;ullen and the &s;ame, ever was and will be &s;o, in what manner, and in what Language &s;oever 'tis ex|pre&s;s'd. <HI>Words</HI> without it, are only Noi&s;e, which any Brute can make as well as we, and Birds much better; for <HI>Words</HI> without <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> make but dull Mu&s;ick. Thus a man may &s;peak in <HI>Words,</HI> but perfectly unintelligible as to <HI>Meaning;</HI> he may <HI>talk</HI> a great deal, but <HI>&s;ay</HI> nothing. But 'tis the proper Po&s;ition of <HI>Words,</HI> adapted to their Significations, which makes them in|telligible,
<PB N="245" REF="260">
and conveys the Meaning of the Speaker to the Under&s;tanding of the Hearer; the contrary to which we call <HI>Non&s;en&s;e;</HI> and there is a &s;u|perfluous crowding in of in&s;ignificant Words, more than are needful to ex|pre&s;s the thing intended, and this is <HI>Impertinence;</HI> and that again car|ry'd to an extreme, is <HI>ridiculous.</HI></P>

<P>'Tis a &s;en&s;le&s;s, fooli&s;h, ridiculous Practice; 'tis a Mean to no manner of End; 'tis Words &s;poken which &s;ig|nify nothing; 'tis Folly acted for the &s;ake of Folly, which is a thing even the Devil him&s;elf don't practice: The Devil does evil, we &s;ay, but it is for &s;ome de&s;ign, either to &s;educe others, or, as &s;ome Divines &s;ay, from a Prin|ciple of Enmity to his Maker: Men Steal for Gain, and Murther to gratify their Avarice or Revenge; Whore|doms and Ravi&s;hments, Adulteries and Sodomy, are committed to plea&s;e a vicious Appetite, and have always alluring Objects; and generally all Vices have &s;ome previous Cau&s;e, and

<P>Again, other Vices men find &s;ome Rea&s;on or other to give for, or Ex|cu&s;es to palliate; men plead Want, to extenuate Theft; and &s;trong Provo|cations, to excu&s;e Murthers; <HI>and many a lame Excu&s;e they will bring for Whoring;</HI> but this &s;ordid Habit, even tho&s;e that practi&s;e it will own to be a Crime, and make no Excu&s;e for it; and the mo&s;t I cou'd ever hear a man &s;ay for it, was, That <HI>he cou'd not help it.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as 'tis an inexcu&s;able Im|pertinence, &s;o 'tis a Breach upon Good Manners and Conver&s;ation, for a man

Next to this, which I e&s;teem as the mo&s;t Noble and mo&s;t U&s;eful Propo&s;al in this Book, I proceed to Academies for Military Studies; and becau&s;e I de|&s;ign rather to expre&s;s my meaning, than make a large Book, I bring them all into one Chapter.</P>
<P>I allow the War is the be&s;t Acade|my in the World, where men &s;tudy by Nece&s;&s;ity, and practi&s;e by Force, and both to &s;ome purpo&s;e, with Duty in the Action, and a Reward in the End; and 'tis evident to any man who knows the World, or has made any Ob&s;ervations on things, what an Improvement the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation has made, during this Seven Years War.</P>
<P>But &s;hould you ask how dear it fir&s;t co&s;t, and what a condition <HI>Eng|land</HI> was in for a War at fir&s;t on this account; how almo&s;t all our Engineers and Great Officers were Foreigners, it
<PB N="253" REF="268">
may put us in mind how nece&s;&s;ary it is to have our people &s;o practis'd in the Arts of War, that they may not be Novices when they come to the Expe|riment.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ome, who were no great Friends to the Government, take advantage to reflect upon the King in the beginning of his Wars in <HI>Ireland,</HI> That he did not care to tru&s;t the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> but all his Great Officers, his Ge|nerals, and Engineers were Foreigners. And tho' the Ca&s;e was &s;o plain as to need no An&s;wer, and the Per&s;ons &s;uch as de&s;erv'd none, yet this mu&s;t be ob|&s;erv'd, tho' twas very &s;trange, That when the pre&s;ent King took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Kingdom, and &s;eeing him&s;elf entring upon the bloodie&s;t War this Age has known, began to regulate his Army, he found but very few among the whole Martial Part of the Nation fit to make u&s;e of for General Officers; and
<PB N="254" REF="269">
was forced to employ Strangers, and make them <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> as the Counts <HI>Schomberg, Ginkel, Solms, Ruvigny,</HI> and others: And yet it is to be ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that all the Encouragement imaginable was given to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, to qualify them&s;elves, by giving no le&s;s than Sixteen Regiments to Gentlemen of Good Families, who had never been in any Service, and knew but very little how to command them: Of the&s;e &s;everal are now in the Army, and have the Rewards &s;uitable to their Merit, being Major-Generals, Briga|deers, and the like.</P>
<P>If then a long Peace had &s;o reduc'd us to a degree of Ignorance that might have been dangerous to us, had we not a King, who is always follow'd by the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters in the World, Who knows what Peace and different Go|vernors may bring us to again?</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="270">
The manner of making War dif|fers perhaps as much as any thing in the world; and if we look no further back than our Civil Wars; 'tis plain a Ge|neral <HI>then</HI> wou'd hardly be fit to be a Collonel now, &s;aving his Capacity of Improvement. The Defen&s;ive Art al|ways follows the Offen&s;ive; and tho' the latter has extremely got the &s;tart of the former in this Age, yet the other is mightily improving al&s;o.</P>
<P>We &s;aw in <HI>England</HI> a bloody Civil War, where, according to the old Temper of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> fighting was the Bu&s;ine&s;s. To have an Army ly|ing in &s;uch a Po&s;t, as not to be able to come at them, was a thing never heard of in that War; even the weak|e&s;t Party would always come out and fight; <HI>Dunbar</HI> Fight, for in&s;tance; and they that were beaten to day, would fight again to morrow, and &s;eek one another out with &s;uch Eager|ne&s;s,
<PB N="256" REF="271">
as if they had been in ha&s;te to have their Brains knock'd out. En|campments, Intrenchments, Batteries, Counter-marchings, fortifying of Camps, and Cannonadings, were &s;trange, and almo&s;t unknown things, and whole Campaigns were pa&s;t over, and hardly any Tents made u&s;e of. Battels, Surprizes, Storming of Towns, Skirmi&s;hes, Sieges, Ambu&s;cades, and Beating up Quarters, was the News of every day. Now 'tis frequent to have Armies of Fifty thou&s;and men of a &s;ide &s;tand at Bay within view of one another, and &s;pend a whole Cam|paign in Dodging, or as 'tis genteely call'd, <HI>Ob&s;erving one another,</HI> and then march off into Winter-Quarters. The difference is in the Maxims of War, which now differ as much from what they were formerly, as Long Perukes do from Piqued Beards; or as the Ha|bits of the People do now, from what
<PB N="257" REF="272">
they then wore. The pre&s;ent Maxims of the War are;<Q>Never Fight without a manife&s;t Advan|tage.</Q>
<Q>And always Encamp &s;o as not to be forc'd to it.</Q> And if two oppo&s;ite Generals nicely ob&s;erve both the&s;e Rules, it is impo&s;|&s;ible they &s;hou'd ever come to fight.</P>
<P>I grant that this way of making War &s;pends generally more Money and le&s;s Blood than former Wars did; but then it &s;pins Wars out to a great|er Length; and I almo&s;t que&s;tion whether if this had been the way of Fighting of old, our Civil War had not la&s;ted till this day. Their Maxim was,
<Q>Whereever you meet your Enemy, fight him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="273">
But the Ca&s;e is quite different now; and I think 'tis plain in the pre&s;ent War, that 'tis not he who has the long|e&s;t Sword, &s;o much as he who has the <HI>longe&s;t Pur&s;e,</HI> will hold the War out be&s;t. <HI>Europe</HI> is all engag'd in the War, and the Men will never be exhau&s;ted while either Party can find Money; but he who finds him&s;elf poore&s;t, mu&s;t give out fir&s;t; and this is evi|dent in the <HI>French</HI> King, who now in|clines to Peace, and owns it, while at the &s;ame time his Armies are nu|merous and whole; but the Sinews fail, he finds his Exchequer fail, his Kingdom drain'd, and Money hard to come at: Not that I believe half the Reports we have had of the Mi&s;ery and Poverty of the <HI>French</HI> are true; but 'tis manife&s;t the King of <HI>France</HI> finds, whatever his Armies may do, his Money won't hold out &s;o long as the <HI>Confederates;</HI> and therefore he u&s;es
<PB N="259" REF="274">
all the means po&s;&s;ible to procure a Peace, while he may do it with the mo&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion but the <HI>French</HI> may hold the War out &s;everal Years longer; but their King is too wi&s;e to let things run to extremity; he will rather conde&s;cend to Peace upon hard terms now, than &s;tay longer, if he finds him&s;elf in danger to be forc'd to wor&s;e.</P>
<P>This being the only Digre&s;&s;ion I de&s;ign to be guilty of, I hope I &s;hall be excus'd it.</P>
<P>The Sum of all is this, That &s;ince 'tis &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be in a condition for War in a time of Peace, our People &s;hou'd be inur'd to it. 'Tis &s;trange that every thing &s;hou'd be ready but the Soldier: Ships are ready, and our Trade keeps the Seamen always

and afterwards under the King's Care for Preferment, as their Merit and His Maje&s;ty's Favour &s;hall recommend them; from whence His Maje&s;ty wou'd at all times be furni&s;h'd with able Engineers, Gunners, Fire-ma&s;ters, Bombardiers, Miners, and the like.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Second College for Volun|tary Students in the &s;ame Exerci&s;es; who &s;hou'd all upon certain limited Conditions be entertain'd, and have all the advantages of the Lectures, Experiments, and Learning of the College, and be al&s;o capable of &s;e|veral Titles, Profits, and Settlements in the &s;aid College, an&s;werable to the Fellows in the Univer&s;ities.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Third College for Tempo|rary Study, into which any Per&s;on who is a Gentleman, and an <HI>En|gli&s;hman,</HI> entring his Name, and conforming to the Orders of the Hou&s;e, &s;hall be entertain'd like a Gen|tleman
<PB N="262" REF="277">

<P>The Building mu&s;t be very Large, and &s;hou'd rather be Stately and Mag|nificent in Figure, than Gay and Co&s;t|ly in Ornament: And I think &s;uch a Hou&s;e as <HI>Chel&s;ea-College,</HI> only about

I remember the
<PB N="276" REF="291">
Story of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, an Officer at the Siege of <HI>Limerick</HI> in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> who tho' he was Brave enough upon Action, yet for the only matter of being ignorant in the Terms of Art, and knowing not how to talk <HI>Camp-Language,</HI> was expos'd to be laugh'd at by the whole Army, for mi&s;taking the opening of the Trenches, which he thought had been a Mine again&s;t the Town.</P>
<P>The Experiments of the&s;e Colleges wou'd be as well worth publi&s;hing, as the Acts of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI> To which purpo&s;e the Hou&s;e mu&s;t be built where they may have Ground to ca&s;t Bombs, to rai&s;e Regular Works, as Batteries, Ba&s;tions, Half-Moons, Redoubts, Horn-works, Forts, and the like; with the convenience of Wa|ter to draw round &s;uch Works, to exerci&s;e the Engineers in all the nece&s;|&s;ary Experiments of Dreining, and
<PB N="277" REF="292">
Mining under Ditches. There mu&s;t be room to fire Great Shot at a di&s;tance, to Canonade a Camp, to throw all &s;orts of Fire-works and Machines, that are or &s;hall be invented; to open Trenches, form Camps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Their Publick Exerci&s;es will be al&s;o very diverting, and more worth while for any Gentlemen to &s;ee, than the Sights or Shews which our people in <HI>England</HI> are &s;o fond of.</P>
<P>I believe, as a Con&s;titution might be form'd from the&s;e Generals, this wou'd be the Greate&s;t, the Gallante&s;t, and the mo&s;t U&s;eful Foundation in the World. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentry wou'd be the be&s;t qualifi'd, and con&s;equent|ly, be&s;t accepted abroad, and mo&s;t u&s;eful at home of any people in the world; and His Maje&s;ty &s;hou'd never more be expos'd to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing Foreigners in the Po&s;ts of Tru&s;t and Service in His Armies.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="293">
And that the whole Kingdom might in &s;ome degree be better qualifi'd for Service, I think the following Project wou'd be very u&s;eful.</P>
<P>When our Military Weapon was the <HI>Long-Bow,</HI> at which our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in &s;ome mea&s;ure excell'd the whole World, the meane&s;t Countrey|man was a good Archer; and that which qualifi'd them &s;o much for Service in the War, was their Diver|&s;ion in Times of Peace; which al&s;o had this good Effect, That when an Army was to be rais'd, they needed no di&s;ciplining: And for the Encou|ragement of the People to an Exer|ci&s;e &s;o publickly Profitable, an Act of Parliament was made, to oblige every Pari&s;h to maintain Buts for the Youth in the Countrey to &s;hoot at.</P>
<P>Since our way of fighting is now alter'd; and this de&s;tructive Engine, the <HI>Mu&s;quet,</HI> is the proper Arms for the
<PB N="279" REF="294">
Soldier, I could wi&s;h the Diver&s;ion al&s;o of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would change too, that our Plea&s;ures and Profit might corre&s;pond. 'Tis a great Hindrance to this Nation, e&s;pecially where Stand|ing-Armies are a Grievance, that if ever a War commence, men mu&s;t have at lea&s;t a Year before they are thought fit to face an Enemy, to in|&s;truct them how to handle their Arms; and new-rais'd men are call'd <HI>Raw Sol|diers.</HI> To help this, at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure, I wou'd propo&s;e, That the Publick Exerci&s;es of our Youth &s;hou'd by &s;ome Publick Encouragement, (<HI>for Penalties won't do it</HI>) be drawn off from the fooli&s;h Boyi&s;h Sports of Cocking, and Cricketing, and from Tipling, to &s;hooting with a Firelock; an Exerci&s;e as Plea&s;ant, as 'tis Manly and Generous; and <HI>Swimming,</HI> which is a thing &s;o many ways profitable, be&s;ides its being a great Pre&s;ervative
<PB N="280" REF="295">
of Health, that methinks no Man ought to be without it.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) For <HI>Shooting;</HI> the Colleges I have mention'd above, having provided for the in&s;tructing the Gentry at the King's Charge; the Gentry in return of that Favour &s;hou'd introduce it among the Countrey-people; which might ea&s;ily be done thus:</P>
<P>If every Countrey-Gentleman, ac|cording to his degree, wou'd con|tribute to &s;et up a Prize, to be &s;hot for by the Town he lives in, or the Neigh|bourhood, about once a year, or twice a year, or oftner, as they think fit; which Prize not &s;ingle only to him who &s;hoots neare&s;t, but accord|ing to the Cu&s;tom of Shooting:</P>
<P>This wou'd certainly &s;et all the Young Men in <HI>England</HI> a &s;hooting, and make them Marks-men; for they wou'd be always practi&s;ing and ma|king
<PB N="281" REF="296">
Matches among them&s;elves too, and the advantage wou'd be found in a War; for no doubt if all the Sol|diers in a Battalion took a true Level at their Enemy, there wou'd be much more Execution done at a di&s;tance than there is; whereas it has been known now, that a Battalion of men has receiv'd the Fire of another Batta|lion, and not lo&s;t above 30 or 40 men; and I &s;uppo&s;e it will not ea&s;ily be for|got how at the Battel of <HI>Agrim,</HI> a Battalion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army receiv'd the whole Fire of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiment of Dragoons, but never knew to this day whether they had any Bullets or no; and I need appeal no further than to any Officer that &s;erv'd in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> War, what advantages the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ar|mies made of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> being &s;uch wonderful Marks-men.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="297">
Under this Head of <HI>Academies,</HI> I might bring in a Project for</P>
<P><HI>An Academy for Women.</HI></P>
<P>I Have often thought of it as one of the mo&s;t barbarous Cu&s;toms in the world, con&s;idering us as a Civi|liz'd and a Chri&s;tian Countrey, that we deny the advantages of Learning to Women. We reproach the Sex every day with Folly and Impertinence, while I am confident, had they the ad|vantages of Education equal to us, they wou'd be guilty of le&s;s than our &s;elves.</P>
<P>One wou'd wonder indeed how it &s;hou'd happen that Women are con|ver&s;ible at all, &s;ince they are only be|holding to Natural Parts for all their Knowledge. Their Youth is &s;pent to teach them to Stitch and Sow, or make Bawbles: They are taught to Read indeed, and perhaps to Write their Names, or &s;o; and that is the
<PB N="283" REF="298">
heighth of a Woman's Education. And I wou'd but ask any who &s;light the Sex for their Under&s;tanding, What is a Man (a Gentleman, I mean) good for, that is taught no more?</P>
<P>I need not give In&s;tances, or exa|mine the Character of a Gentleman with a good E&s;tate, and of a good Family, and with tolerable Parts, and examine what Figure he makes for want of Education.</P>
<P>The Soul is plac'd in the Bo|dy like a rough Diamond, and mu&s;t be poli&s;h'd, or the Lu&s;tre of it will never appear: And 'tis manife&s;t, that as the Rational Soul di&s;tingui&s;hes us from Brutes, &s;o Education carries on the di&s;tinction, and makes &s;ome le&s;s bruti&s;h than others: This is too evi|dent to need any demon&s;tration. But why then &s;hou'd Women be deni'd the benefit of In&s;truction? If Know|ledge and Under&s;tanding had been
<PB N="284" REF="299">
u&s;ele&s;s additions to the Sex, God Al|mighty wou'd never have given them Capacities; for he made nothing needle&s;s: Be&s;ides, I wou'd ask &s;uch, What they can &s;ee in Ignorance, that they &s;hou'd think it a nece&s;&s;ary Orna|ment to a Woman? Or how much wor&s;e is a Wi&s;e Woman than a Fool? Or what has the Woman done to for|feit the Privilege of being taught? Does &s;he plague us with her Pride and Impertinence? Why did we not let her learn, that &s;he might have had more Wit? Shall we upbraid Women with Folly, when 'tis only the Error of this inhuman Cu&s;tom, that hindred them being made wi&s;er?</P>
<P>The Capacities of Women are &s;up|pos'd to be greater, and their Sen&s;es quicker than tho&s;e of the Men; and what they might be capable of being bred to, is plain from &s;ome In&s;tances of Female-Wit, which this Age is not
<PB N="285" REF="300">
without; which upbraids us with In|ju&s;tice, and looks as if we deni'd Wo|men the advantages of Education, for fear they &s;hou'd <HI>vye</HI> with the Men in their Improvements.</P>
<P>To remove this Objection, and that Women might have at lea&s;t a needful Opportunity of Education in all &s;orts of U&s;eful Learning, I pro|po&s;e the Draught of an Academy for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I know 'tis dangerous to make Pub|lick Appearances of the Sex; they are not either to be <HI>confin'd</HI> or <HI>expos'd;</HI> the fir&s;t will di&s;agree with their Inclina|tions, and the la&s;t with their Repu|tations; and therefore it is &s;omewhat difficult; and I doubt a Method pro|pos'd by an Ingenious Lady, in a little Book, call'd, <HI>Advice to the Ladies,</HI> would be found impracticable. For, &s;a|ving my Re&s;pect to the Sex, the Le|vity, which perhaps is a little peculiar
<PB N="286" REF="301">
to them, at lea&s;t in their Youth, will not bear the Re&s;traint; and I am &s;a|tisfi'd, nothing but the heighth of Bi|gotry can keep up a Nunnery: Women are extravagantly de&s;irous of going to Heaven, and will puni&s;h their <HI>Pret|ty Bodies</HI> to get thither; but nothing el&s;e will do it; and even in that ca&s;e &s;ometimes it falls out that <HI>Nature will prevail.</HI></P>
<P>When I talk therefore of an Aca|demy for Women, I mean both the Model, the Teaching, and the Go|vernment, different from what is propos'd by that Ingenious Lady, for who&s;e Propo&s;al I have a very great E&s;teem, and al&s;o a great Opinion of her Wit; different too from all &s;orts of Religious Confinement, and above all, from <HI>Vows of Celibacy.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore the Academy I propo&s;e &s;hould differ but little from Publick Schools, wherein &s;uch Ladies as were
<PB N="287" REF="302">
willing to &s;tudy, &s;hou'd have all the advantages of Learning &s;uitable to their Genius.</P>
<P>But &s;ince &s;ome Severities of Di&s;ci|pline more than ordinary wou'd be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the Reputation of the Hou&s;e, that Per&s;ons of Quality and Fortune might not be a fraid to venture their Children thi|ther, I &s;hall venture to make a &s;mall Scheme by way of E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>The Hou&s;e I wou'd have built in a Form by it &s;elf, as well as in a Place by it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>The Building &s;hou'd be of Three plain Fronts, without any Jettings, or Bearing-Work, that the Eye might at a Glance &s;ee from one Coin to the other; the Gardens wall'd in the &s;ame Triangular Figure, with a large Moat, and but one Entrance.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="303">
When thus every part of the Sci|tuation was contriv'd as well as might be for di&s;covery, and to render <HI>In|trieguing</HI> dangerous, I wou'd have no Guards, no Eyes, no Spies &s;et over the Ladies, but &s;hall expect them to be try'd by the Principles of Honour and &s;trict Virtue.</P>
<P>And if I am ask'd, <HI>Why?</HI> I mu&s;t ask Pardon of my own Sex for giving this rea&s;on for it:</P>
<P>I am &s;o much in Charity with Wo|men, and &s;o well acquainted with Men, that 'tis my opinion, There needs no other Care to prevent In|trieguing, than to keep the men ef|fectually away: For tho' <HI>Inclination,</HI> which we prettily call <HI>Love,</HI> does &s;ometimes move a little too vi&s;ibly in the Sex, and Frailty often follows; yet I think verily, <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> which we mi&s;call <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> has &s;o far the A&s;cendant over the Sex, that <HI>Solicitation</HI> always goes before it.</P>
<Q><PB N="289" REF="304">
<L>Cu&s;tom with Women '&s;tead of Virtue rules;</L>
<L>It leads the Wi&s;e&s;t, and commands the Fools:</L>
<L>For this alone, when Inclinations reign,</L>
<L>Tho' Virtue's fled, will Acts of Vice re&s;train.</L>
<L>Only by Cu&s;tom 'tis that Virtue lives,</L>
<L>And Love requires to be ask'd, before it gives.</L>
<L>For that which we call <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> is <HI>Pride:</HI></L>
<L>They &s;corn to ask, and hate to be deni'd.</L>
<L>'Tis Cu&s;tom thus prevails upon their Want;</L>
<L>They'll never beg, what askt they eas'ly grant.</L>
<L>And when the needle&s;s Ceremony's over,</L>
<L>Them&s;elves the Weakne&s;s of the Sex di&s;cover.</L>
<L>If then De&s;ires are &s;trong, and Nature free,</L>
<L>Keep from her Men, and Opportunity.</L>
<L>El&s;e 'twill be vain to curb her by Re&s;traint;</L>
<L>But keep the Que&s;tion off, you keep the Saint.</L></Q>
<P>In &s;hort, let a Woman have never &s;uch a Coming-Principle, &s;he will let you ask before &s;he complies, at lea&s;t if &s;he be a Woman of any Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="305">
Upon this ground I am per&s;uaded &s;uch Mea&s;ures might be taken, that the Ladies might have all the Freedom in the world within their own Walls, and yet no Intrieguing, no Indecen|cies, nor Scandalous Affairs happen; and in order to this, the following Cu&s;toms and Laws &s;hou'd be ob|&s;erv'd in the Colleges; of which I wou'd propo&s;e One at lea&s;t in every County in <HI>England,</HI> and about Ten for the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>After the Regulation of the Form of the Building as before;<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) All the Ladies who enter into the Hou&s;e, &s;hou'd &s;et their Hands to the Orders of the Hou&s;e, to &s;ignify their Con&s;ent to &s;ubmit to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) As no Woman &s;hou'd be receiv'd, but who declar'd her &s;elf willing, and that it was the Act of her Choice to en|ter her &s;elf, &s;o no Per&s;on &s;hou'd be con|fin'd to continue there a moment lon|ger

than the &s;ame voluntary Choice inclin'd her.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) The Charges of the Hou&s;e being to be paid by the Ladies, every one that entred &s;hou'd have only this Incumbrance, That &s;he &s;hou'd pay for the whole Year, tho' her mind &s;hou'd change as to her continuance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.)

And this Law wou'd by no means be &s;evere; becau&s;e any Woman who was willing to re|ceive the Addre&s;&s;es of a Man, might di&s;charge her &s;elf of the Hou&s;e when &s;he pleas'd; and on the contrary, any Woman who had occa&s;ion, might di&s;|charge her &s;elf of the Impertinent Addre&s;&s;es of any Per&s;on &s;he had an Aver&s;ion to, by entring into the Hou&s;e.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="307"><HI>In this Hou&s;e,</HI></P>
<P>The Per&s;ons who Enter, &s;hou'd be taught all &s;orts of Breeding &s;uitable to both their Genius and their Quality; and in particular, <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Dancing,</HI> which it wou'd be cruelty to bar the Sex of, becau&s;e they are their Dar|lings: But be&s;ides this, they &s;hou'd be taught Languages, as particularly <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian;</HI> and I wou'd ven|ture the Injury of giving a Woman more Tongues than one.</P>
<P>They &s;hou'd, as a particular Study, be taught all the Graces of Speech, and all the nece&s;&s;ary Air of Conver|&s;ation; which our common Edu|cation is &s;o defective in, that I need not expo&s;e it: They &s;hou'd be brought to read Books, and e&s;pe|cially Hi&s;tory, and &s;o to read as to make them under&s;tand the World,
<PB N="293" REF="308">
and be able to know and judge of things when they hear of them.</P>
<P>To &s;uch who&s;e Genius wou'd lead them to it, I wou'd deny no &s;ort of Learning; but the chief thing in ge|neral is to cultivate the Under&s;tandings of the Sex, that they may be capable of all &s;orts of Conver&s;ation; that their Parts and Judgments being im|prov'd, they may be as Profitable in their Conver&s;ation as they are Plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Women, in my ob&s;ervation, have little or no difference in them, but as they are, or are not di&s;tingui&s;h'd by E|ducation. Tempers indeed may in &s;ome degree influence them, but the main di&s;tingui&s;hing part is their Breeding.</P>
<P>The whole Sex are generally Quick and Sharp: I believe I may be allow'd to &s;ay generally &s;o; for you rarely &s;ee them lumpi&s;h and heavy when they are Children, as Boys will often be. If a Woman be well-bred, and taught
<PB N="294" REF="309">
the proper Management of her Natu|ral Wit, &s;he proves generally very &s;en&s;ible and retentive: And without partiality, a Woman of Sen&s;e and Manners is the Fine&s;t and mo&s;t Deli|cate Part of God's Creation; the Glo|ry of her Maker, and the great In|&s;tance of his &s;ingular regard to Man, his Darling Creature, to whom he gave the be&s;t Gift either God could be&s;tow, or man receive: And 'tis the &s;ordid'&s;t Piece of Folly and Ingrati|tude in the world, to withhold from the Sex the due Lu&s;tre which the ad|vantages of Education gives to the Natural Beauty of their Minds.</P>
<P>A Woman well Bred and well Taught, furni&s;h'd with the additional Accompli&s;hments of Knowledge and Behaviour, <HI>is a Creature without com|pari&s;on;</HI> her Society is the Emblem of &s;ublimer Enjoyments; her Per&s;on is Angelick, and her Conver&s;ation heaven|ly;
<PB N="295" REF="310">
&s;he is all Softne&s;s and Sweetne&s;s, Peace, Love, Wit, and Delight: She is every way &s;uitable to the &s;ublime&s;t Wi&s;h; and the man that has &s;uch a one to his Portion, has nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Suppo&s;e her to be the <HI>very &s;ame</HI> Woman, and rob her of the Benefit of Education, and it follows thus;</P>
<P>If her Temper be Good, want of Education makes her Soft and Ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Her Wit, for want of Teaching, makes her Impertinent and Talka|tive.</P>
<P>Her Knowledge, for want of Judg|ment and Experience, makes her Fan|ciful and Whim&s;ical.</P>
<P>If her Temper be Bad, want of Breeding makes her wor&s;e, and &s;he grows Haughty, In&s;olent, and Loud.</P>
<P>If &s;he be Pa&s;&s;ionate, want of Man|ners makes her Termagant, and a
<PB N="296" REF="311">
Scold, <HI>which is much at one with Lu|natick.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;he be Proud, want of Di&s;cre|tion (which &s;till is Breeding) makes her Conceited, Fanta&s;tick, and Ridi|culous.</P>
<P>And from the&s;e &s;he degenerates to be Turbulent, Clamorous, Noi&s;y, Na&s;ty, <HI>and the Devil.</HI></P>

<P>I think both the&s;e Notions fal&s;e; and yet the la&s;t, which has the &s;hew of Re&s;pect to Providence, is the wor&s;t; for it &s;uppo&s;es Providence to be Indi|gent and Empty; as if it had not wherewith to furni&s;h all the Crea|tures it had made, but was fain to be parcimonious in its Gifts, and di&s;tri|bute them by <HI>piece-meal,</HI> for fear of being exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>If I might venture my Opinion again&s;t an almo&s;t univer&s;al Notion, I wou'd &s;ay, Mo&s;t men mi&s;take the Proceedings of Providence in this ca&s;e, and all the world at this day are mi&s;taken in their Practice about it. And becau&s;e the A&s;&s;ertion is very bold, I de&s;ire to explain my &s;elf.</P>
<P>That Almighty Fir&s;t Cau&s;e which made us all, is certainly the Fountain of Excellence, as it is of Being, and
<PB N="299" REF="316">
by an Invi&s;ible Influence could have diffu&s;ed Equal Qualities and Perfecti|ons to all the Creatures it has made, as the Sun does its Light, without the lea&s;t Ebb or Diminution to him&s;elf; and has given indeed to every indivi|dual &s;ufficient to the Figure his Pro|vidence had de&s;ign'd him in the world.</P>
<P>I believe it might be defended, if I &s;hould &s;ay, That I do &s;uppo&s;e God has given to all Mankind equal Gifts and Capacities, in that he has given them all <HI>Souls</HI> equally capable; and that the whole difference in Mankind proceeds either from Accidental Dif|ference in the Make of their Bodies, or from the <HI>fooli&s;h Difference</HI> of Edu|cation.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From Accidental Difference in Bodies.</HI> I wou'd avoid di&s;cour&s;ing here of the Philo&s;ophical Po&s;ition of the Soul in the Body: But if it be true
<PB N="300" REF="317">
as Philo&s;ophers do affirm, That the Under&s;tanding and Memory is dilated or contracted according to the acci|dental Dimen&s;ions of the Organ through which 'tis convey'd; then tho' God has given a Soul as capable to me as another, yet if I have any Natural Defect in tho&s;e Parts of the Body by which the Soul &s;hou'd act, I may have the &s;ame Soul infus'd as another man, and yet he be a Wi&s;e Man, and I a very Fool. <HI>For example,</HI> If a Child naturally have a Defect in the Organ of Hearing, &s;o that he cou'd never di&s;tingui&s;h any Sound, that Child &s;hall never be able to &s;peak or read, tho' it have a Soul capable of all the Accompli&s;hments in the world. The Brain is the Centre of the Souls actings, where all the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Faculties of it re&s;ide; and 'tis ob&s;ervable, A man who has a nar|row contracted Head, in which there
<PB N="301" REF="318">
is not room for the due and nece&s;&s;ary Operations of Nature by the Brain, is never a man of very great Judg|ment; and that Proverb, <HI>A Great Head and Little Wit,</HI> is not meant by Nature, but is a Reproof upon Sloth; as if one &s;hou'd, by way of wonder, &s;ay, <HI>Fye, fye, you that have a Great Head, have but Little Wit, that's &s;trange! that mu&s;t certainly be your own fault.</HI> From this Notion I do believe there is a great matter in the Breed of Men and Wo|men; not that Wi&s;e Men &s;hall al|ways get Wi&s;e Children; but I be|lieve Strong and Healthy Bodies have the Wi&s;e&s;t Children; and Sickly Weak|ly Bodies affect the Wits as well as the Bodies of their Children. We are ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to believe this in the Breeds of Hor&s;es, Cocks, Dogs, and other Creatures; and I believe 'tis as vi&s;ible in Men.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="319">
But to come clo&s;er to the bu&s;ine&s;s; the great di&s;tingui&s;hing difference which is &s;een in the world between Men and Women, is in their Educa|tion; and this is manife&s;ted by com|paring it with the difference between one Man or Woman, and another.</P>
<P>And herein it is that I take upon me to make &s;uch a bold A&s;&s;ertion, That all the World are mi&s;taken in their Practice about Women: For I cannot think that God Almighty ever made them &s;o delicate, &s;o glorious Creatures, and furni&s;h'd them with &s;uch Charms, &s;o Agreeable and &s;o Delightful to Mankind, with Souls capable of the &s;ame Accompli&s;hments with Men, and all to be only Stewards of our Hou&s;es, <HI>Cooks and Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>Not that I am for exalting the Fe|male Government in the lea&s;t: But, in &s;hort, <HI>I would have Men take Women for Companions, and Educate them to be</HI>
<PB N="303" REF="320">
<HI>fit for it.</HI> A Woman of Sen&s;e and Breeding will &s;corn as much to en|croach upon the Prerogative of the Man, as a Man of Sen&s;e will &s;corn to oppre&s;s the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of the Woman. But if the Womens Souls were refin'd and improv'd by Teaching, that word wou'd be lo&s;t; to &s;ay, <HI>The Weakne&s;s of the Sex,</HI> as to Judgment, wou'd be Non&s;en&s;e; for Ignorance and Folly wou'd be no more to be found among Women than Men. I remember a Pa&s;&s;age which I heard from a very Fine Woman, &s;he had Wit and Capacity enough, an Extra|ordinary Shape and Face, and a Great Fortune, but had been cloy&s;ter'd up all her time, and for fear of being &s;toll'n had not had the liberty of being taught the common nece&s;&s;ary know|ledge of Womens Affairs; and when &s;he came to conver&s;e in the world, her Natural Wit made her &s;o &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="304" REF="321">
of the want of Education, that &s;he gave this &s;hort Reflection on her &s;elf:</P>
<P><HI>I am a&s;ham'd to talk with my very Maids,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>for I don't know when they do right or wrong: I had more need go to School, than be Married.</HI></P>
<P>I need not enlarge on the Lo&s;s the Defect of Education is to the Sex, nor argue the Benefit of the contrary Practice; 'tis a thing will be more ea&s;ily granted than remedied: This Chapter is but an E&s;&s;ay at the thing, and I refer the Practice to tho&s;e Happy Days, if ever they &s;hall be, when men &s;hall be wi&s;e enough to mend it.</P>

(1.) That to the <HI>King</HI> is, That he is forced to pre&s;s Seamen for the Man|ning of his Navy, and force them in|voluntarily into the Service: Which way of violent dragging men into the Fleet, is attended with &s;undry ill cir|cum&s;tances: As,<LIST>

<ITEM>2. Several Irregularities follow, as the Officers taking Money to di&s;mi&s;s Able Seamen, and filling up their Complement with raw and improper Per&s;ons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Oppre&s;&s;ions, Quarrelings, and oftentimes Murthers, by the ra&s;hne&s;s of Pre&s;s-ma&s;ters, and the ob&s;tinacy of &s;ome unwilling to go.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="314" REF="331">
4. A &s;ecret Aver&s;ion to the Service, from a Natural Principle, common to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, to hate Com|pul&s;ion.</ITEM>

Fir&s;t, For Coals; the Colliers be|ing provided with Men at 28 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, and Convoys in &s;ufficient number, and proper Stations from <HI>Tinmouth-Bar</HI> to the River, &s;o as they need not go in Fleets, but as Wind and Weather pre&s;ents, run all the way under the Protection of the Men of War, who &s;hou'd be continually crui|&s;ing from Station to Station; they would be able to perform their Voyage in as &s;hort time as formerly, and at as cheap Pay, and con&s;equently cou'd afford to &s;ell their Coals at 17 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldron, as well as formerly at 15 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore there &s;hou'd be paid into the Trea&s;ury appointed at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> by Bond to be paid where they deliver, 10 <HI>s. per</HI> Chal|dron, <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Mea&s;ure; and the &s;ta|ted

<P>In con&s;ideration al&s;o of the Charge of Convoys, the Ships bringing Coals &s;hall all pay 1 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> on the Value of the Ship, to be agreed on at the Of|fice; and all Convoy-Money exacted by Commanders of Ships, &s;hall be re|linqui&s;h'd, and the Office to make good all Lo&s;&s;es of Ships, <HI>not Goods,</HI> that &s;hall be lo&s;t by Enemies only.</P>
<P>The&s;e Heads indeed are &s;uch as wou'd need &s;ome Explication, if the Expe|riment were to be made; and, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, wou'd reduce the Seamen
<PB N="328" REF="345">
to better Circum&s;tances, at lea&s;t 'twou'd have them in readine&s;s for any Publick Service much ea&s;ier than by all the late methods of En|couragement by regi&s;tring Sea|men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>For by this Method all the Sea|men in the Kingdom &s;hou'd be the King's hired Servants, and receive their Wages from him, <HI>whoever em|ploy'd them;</HI> and no man cou'd hire or employ them, but from him: The Merchant &s;hou'd hire them of the King, and pay the King for them; nor wou'd there be a Seaman in <HI>Eng|land</HI> out of Employ, <HI>which, by the way, wou'd prevent their &s;eeking Service abroad.</HI> If they were not actually at Sea, they wou'd receive Half-Pay, and might be employ'd in Works about the Yards, Stores, and Navy, to keep all things in Repair.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="346">
If a Fleet or Squadron was to be fitted out, they wou'd be mann'd in a Week's time, for all the Seamen in <HI>England</HI> wou'd be ready: Nor wou'd they be &s;hye of the Service; for <HI>it is not</HI> an Aver&s;ion to the King's Service; nor <HI>'tis not</HI> that the Duty is harder in the Men of War than the Merchant-men; nor <HI>'tis not</HI> fear of Danger which makes our Seamen lurk, and hide, and hang back in a time of War; but 'tis <HI>Wages</HI> is the matter: 24 <HI>s. per</HI> Month in the King's Service, and 40 to 50 <HI>s. per</HI> Month from the Merchant, is the true cau&s;e; and the Seaman is in the right of it too; for who wou'd &s;erve his King and Countrey, and fight, and be knock'd o' the head at 24 <HI>s. per</HI> Month that can have 50 <HI>s.</HI> without that ha|zard: And till this be remedied, in vain are all the Encouragements which can be given to Seamen; for
<PB N="330" REF="347">
they tend but to make them In&s;olent, and encourage their Extravagance.</P>
<P>Nor wou'd this Proceeding be any damage to the Seamen in general; for 24 <HI>s. per</HI> Month Wages, and to be kept in con&s;tant Service, or Half-Pay when idle, is really better to the Seamen than 45 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, as they now take it, con&s;idering how long they often lye idle on &s;hore, out of Pay: For the extravagant Price of Seamens Wages, tho' it has been an Intolerable Burthen to Trade, has not vi&s;ibly enrich'd the Sailors; and they may as well be content with 24 <HI>s. per</HI> Month now as formerly.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Trade wou'd be &s;en&s;ibly reviv'd by it, the intole|rable Price of Freights wou'd be redu|ced, and the Publick wou'd reap an immen&s;e Benefit by the Payments men|tion'd in the Propo&s;al; as,<LIST>
<PB N="331" REF="348">
<ITEM>(1.) 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Month upon the Wa|ges of all the Seamen employ'd by the Merchant; which if we allow 200000 Seamen always in Employ, as there cannot be le&s;s in all the Ships be|longing to <HI>England,</HI> is 40000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) 40 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton Freight upon all Goods imported.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Value of all Goods exported or imported.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) 10 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldron upon all the Coals &s;hipp'd at <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> and 1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Ships which carry them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>What the&s;e Four Articles wou'd pay to the <HI>Exchequer</HI> yearly, 'twou'd be very difficult to calculate, and I am too near the End of this Book to attempt it: But I believe no Tax ever given &s;ince this War, has come near it.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="349">
'Tis true, out of this the Publick wou'd be to pay Half-Pay to the Sea|men who &s;hall be out of Employ, and all the Lo&s;&s;es and Damages on Goods and Ships; which tho' it might be con&s;i|derable, wou'd be &s;mall, compar'd to the Payment afore&s;aid; for as the <HI>Pre|mio</HI> of 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is but &s;mall, &s;o the Safety lies upon all men being bound to In&s;ure: For I believe any one will grant me this, 'tis not the &s;mallne&s;s of a Premio Ruins the En&s;urer, but 'tis the &s;mallne&s;s of the Quantity he In|&s;ures; and I am not at all a&s;ham'd to affirm, That let but a Premio of 4 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> be paid into one Man's hand for all Goods Imported and Exported, and any Man may be the General En|&s;urer of the Kingdom, and yet that Premio can never hurt the Merchant neither.</P>
<P>So that the va&s;t Revenue this wou'd rai&s;e, wou'd be felt no where, nei|ther
<PB N="333" REF="350">
Poor nor Rich wou'd Pay the more for Coals; Foreign Goods wou'd be brought home cheaper, and our own Goods carri'd to Market cheaper; Owners wou'd get more by Ships, Merchants by Goods, and Lo&s;&s;es by Sea wou'd be no Lo&s;s at all to any Body, becau&s;e Repaid by the Publick Stock.</P>
<P>Another un&s;een Advantage wou'd ari&s;e by it, we &s;hou'd be able to out|work all our Neighbours, even the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves, by Sailing as cheap, and carrying Goods as cheap in a time of War as in Peace, an Advan|tage which has more in it, than is ea&s;ily thought of, and wou'd have a noble influence upon all our Foreign Trade. For what cou'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> do in Trade, if we cou'd carry our Goods to <HI>Cadiz</HI> at 50 <HI>s. per Ton</HI> Freight, and they give 8 or 10 <HI>l.</HI> and the like in other Places? Whereby we cou'd
<PB N="334" REF="351">
be able to Sell cheaper or get more thau our Neighbours.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal con&s;iderable clau|&s;es might be added to this Propo&s;al, &s;ome of great advantage to the Ge|neral Trade of the Kingdom, &s;ome to particular Trades, and more to the Publick; but I avoid being too Parti|cular in things which are but the Pro|duct of my own private Opinion.</P>
<P>If the Government &s;hou'd ever pro|ceed to the Experiment, no que&s;tion but much more than has been hinted at wou'd appear; nor do I &s;ee any great difficulty in the Attempt, or who wou'd be aggriev'd at it; and there I leave it, rather wi&s;hing than expecting to &s;ee it undertaken.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>UPon a Review of the &s;everal Chapters of this Book, I find that in&s;tead of being able to go further, &s;ome things may have &s;uffer'd for want of being fully ex|pre&s;s'd; which if any per&s;on object again&s;t, I only &s;ay, I cannot now avoid it: I have endeavour'd to keep to my Title, and of|fer'd but at an <HI>E&s;&s;ay;</HI> which any one is at liberty to go on with as they plea&s;e; for I can promi&s;e no Supplement. As to Errors of Opinion, tho' I am not yet convinc'd of any, yet I no where pretend to Infallibility: However, I do not willingly a&s;&s;ert any thing which I have not good Grounds for. If I am mi&s;taken, let him that finds the Er|ror, inform the World better, and never trouble him&s;elf to animadvert upon this, &s;ince I a&s;&s;ure him I &s;hall not enter into any Pen and Ink Conte&s;t on the matter.</P>
<P>As to Objections which may lye again&s;t any of the Propo&s;als made in this Book, I have in &s;ome places mention'd &s;uch as oc|curr'd to my Thoughts. I &s;hall never a&s;&s;ume that Arrogance to pretend no other or fur|ther
<PB N="336" REF="353">
Objections may be rais'd; but I do real|ly believe no &s;uch Objection can be rais'd, as will overthrow any Scheme here laid down, &s;o as to render the thing impractica|ble: Neither do I think but that all men will acknowledge mo&s;t of the Propo&s;als in this Book would be of as great, and perhaps greater Advantage to the Publick, than I have pretended to.</P>
<P>As for &s;uch who read Books only to find out the Author's <HI>faux Pas,</HI> who will quar|rel at the Meanne&s;s of Stile, Errors of Pointing, Dulne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion, or the like, I have but little to &s;ay to them; I thought I had corrected it very carefully, and yet &s;ome Mi&s;pointings and &s;mall Er|rors have &s;lipt me, which 'tis too late to help: As to Language, I have been rather careful to make it &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;uitable to the Manner of the Story, than to dre&s;s it up with Exactne&s;s of Stile; chu&s;ing rather to have it Free and Familiar, according to the Nature of <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> than to &s;train at a Per|fection of Language, which I rather wi&s;h for than pretend to be Ma&s;ter of.</P>
