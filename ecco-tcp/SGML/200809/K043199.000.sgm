<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE unrelenting oppo&s;ition which the productions of the author of the pre&s;ent comedy have experienced for &s;everal years is well known, to tho&s;e who pay attention to our public amu&s;e|ments. It is not for him to pronounce how far this oppo&s;ition has been merited by inability. Since the appearance of The Road to Ruin, his comedy of The De&s;erted Daughter only has e&s;caped; and that, as he imagines, becau&s;e it was not known on the night of its fir&s;t performance by whom it was written. Love's Frailties, The Man of Ten Thou&s;and, and Knave or Not? have &s;u&s;tained increa&s;ing marks of ho&s;tility: &s;o that the efforts made to afford rational amu&s;ement to the public, emolument to the author, and improvement to morals, have been ren|dered feeble and almo&s;t ineffectual. In the la&s;t in&s;tance, one mi&s;take appears to have pervaded the majority of the &s;pectators. It was imagined that the author him&s;elf was as unqualified a libeller of mankind as Monro&s;e: in which character the writer's individual &s;entiments were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been incorporated. Tho&s;e who have read his other works &s;urely cannot attribute to him any &s;uch indi&s;criminate mi&s;anthropy. The accu&s;ation that has mo&s;t generally been made again&s;t him is that he thinks men capable of gradations of virtue, which others affirm they can never attain. Per&s;ons, who have made the human mind their &s;tudy, have di&s;covered that guilty men exert the whole force of their facul|ties to ju&s;tify their own cour&s;e of action to them&s;elves. To this principle the writer was &s;trictly attentive, in pourtraying the character of Monro&s;e. His de&s;ign was to draw a man of genius, mi&s;led by his pa&s;&s;ions, rea&s;oning on his actions, &s;y&s;tematizing them, condemning them in principle, but ju&s;tifying them in practice, and heating his imagination by contemplating the crimes of others; that he might &s;till maintain that re&s;pect for him&s;elf of which the &s;tronge&s;t minds, even in the la&s;t &s;tages of vice, are &s;o tenacious. How far that &s;pirit of faction, commo|tion, and anarchy, of which the author has long been and is &s;till &s;o vehemently accu&s;ed, is to be traced in the pre&s;ent co|medy may now be &s;een. Sincerely de&s;irous of giving no of|fence, the pa&s;&s;ages which were mo&s;t di&s;approved, or to &s;peak more accurately reprobated, on the fir&s;t night, have &s;ince been omitted in repre&s;entation: but they are printed between in|verted
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
commas; that the cool judgment may decide whether the author could have been &s;o in&s;ane as actually to intend to en|flame the &s;pectators, and increa&s;e a &s;pirit of enmity between men of different &s;entiments: whom, could he reconcile, he would ac|count it the mo&s;t beneficial and heart con&s;oling action of his life. The &s;eventh &s;cene in the fourth act is likewi&s;e omitted, in the performance: becau&s;e, in&s;tead of giving plea&s;ure, it appeared tedious. It is in&s;erted here rather to pre&s;erve a nece&s;&s;ary con|nection between the &s;cenes, than to appeal from the judgment and the feelings of a whole audience.</P>
<P>Before the comedy appeared, all parties were anxious that no &s;entence or word &s;hould be &s;poken, which could be liable to mi&s;repre&s;entation. Some few pa&s;&s;ages, therefore, are commit|ted to the pre&s;s, which never were &s;poken on the Stage: par|ticularly the concluding part of the la&s;t &s;peech in the &s;econd act, where Monro&s;e enquires into his qualifications for being a lord. A few years ago, this would have been common-place &s;atire: and it is a &s;ubject of no little regret that, at pre&s;ent, lo|cal and temporary applications are &s;o liable to be made where none are intended.</P>
<P>Truth requires it &s;hould be mentioned that, in the original &s;ketch of this comedy, &s;ome hints were taken from IL RAG|GIRATORE, LA SERVA AMOROSA, and IL PADRE DI FAMI|GLIA, by GOLDONI: but of the&s;e, though he has not lately examined them, the author is per&s;uaded &s;o few traces remain that they are &s;carcely di&s;coverable. They are mentioned, be|cau&s;e he con&s;iders the lea&s;t concealment of &s;uch a kind as de|rogatory to that veracity which it is the peculiar duty of moral writers to inculcate.</P>

<BYLINE>BY M. G. LEWIS, ESQ. M. P. AUTHOR OF THE MONK, THE CASTLE SPECTRE, &amp;C.</BYLINE>

<L>I AM angry!&mdash;Quite angry!&mdash;The whole of this night</L>
<L>I've been ready to bur&s;t with vexation and &s;pite;</L>
<L>And now am come hither in ha&s;te, to di&s;clo&s;e</L>
<L>Why grief &s;wells my bo&s;om, and reddens my no&s;e!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In hopes a new road to your favour to find,</L>
<L>The ma&s;k of Thalia I lately re&s;igned;</L>
<L>And, undaunted by prejudice, fa&s;hion, or &s;candal,</L>
<L>Melpomene's dagger I ventured to handle.</L>
<L>My heroic exertions, the truth to confe&s;s,</L>
<L>By the Public's indulgence were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s;</L>
<L>For, when with di&s;traction my bo&s;om was &s;eized,</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure, you all &s;eemed to be mightily plea&s;ed;</L>
<L>When my poniard I drew, you applauded the action;</L>
<L>And, whenever I murdered, &s;howed great &s;atisfaction.</L>
<L>Then is it not hard, that our Author to-night</L>
<L>Should have dragged me at once from my tragical height&punc;</L>
<L>My Bri&s;tol-&s;tone dagger away has he ta'en;</L>
<L>He has cut off four yards of my white &s;atin train,</L>
<L>And pre&s;umptuou&s;ly begs, for the re&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on,</L>
<L>That I'd try to amu&s;e you with nature and rea&s;on!</L>
<L>This prayer, I prote&s;ted, I never could grant;</L>
<L>I had ranted and raved, and would &s;till rave and rant;</L>
<L>And I told him, this part, which for me he had planned,</L>
<L>Was not half enough furious, terrific, or grand.</L>
<L>I &s;ee not one Gho&s;t through the whole of the part;</L>
<L>Cannot once find a place for a Tragedy &s;tart:</L>
<L>My bo&s;om I beat not; my locks mu&s;t not rend;</L>
<L>Nor murder one man from beginning to end!</L>
</LG>

<L>My di&s;plea&s;ure and anger re&s;olved to di&s;play,</L>

<L>"Let a Pompadour Prince wed a Coquelicot Queen.</L>

<L>Me to &s;quall at a Spectre, and frighten the Pit),</L>
<L>I hope you'll allow this performance has merit,</L>

<P>Why ay! Succe&s;s, fortune, and Aurelia &s;hall be mine! As for fame, give me but wealth, and that will come una&s;ked. And yet my cur&s;ed querulous con&s;cience takes part with my &s;i&s;ter, and upbraids me for being an impo&s;tor. Ab&s;urd! Who are not impo&s;tors? Is any man the thing he &s;eems? And, if feign we mu&s;t, is it not better to feign &s;omething that the world re&s;pects, than &s;omething that it de&s;pi&s;es? The &s;on of a curate, I have da&s;hed into life, met variety of adventures, vi&s;ited the Continent, and a&s;&s;umed the airs of a foreign Count. I have certainly di&s;graced my&s;elf; but the world does not think &s;o. Who would &s;hew his naked face when a ma&s;k is &s;o plea&s;ant, &s;o profitable, and &s;o ea&s;ily put on? My father gave me education, Nature gave me de&s;ires, and I have
<PB N="43" REF="52">
given my&s;elf a title. Why not? "If I am not a lord, it &s;eems I ought to have been. I find no difficulty in being as extravagant as a lord, as proud as a lord, as idle as a lord, and as impudent as a lord. I could game like a lord, be duped like a lord, run in debt like a lord, and never pay, as naturally as if I had been born a lord. Let lords look to it, then, and reform. Let them be as &s;uperior to the poor in virtue as they are in power, and I will blu&s;h for being an impo&s;tor."</P>
