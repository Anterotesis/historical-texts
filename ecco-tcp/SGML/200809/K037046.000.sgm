<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it is the fate of dramatic works to undergo a much more &s;evere &s;crutiny than any other of the efforts of the mind; authors, in this predicament, are ju&s;tifiable in taking every opportunity of &s;peaking in their own behalf, and the egoti&s;m &s;hould be, and is, by the candid, readily forgiven them. The applau&s;es be&s;towed upon DUPLICITY, in the Theatre, have equalled my fonde&s;t hopes; and &s;elf-love it&s;elf cannot accu&s;e the auditors of ingratitude, or want of penetration. But though there are &s;cenes happy enough to have given univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, there are others that have been called vulgarities, damned &s;tuff, and by other conci&s;e and &s;ummary epithets, which men accu&s;tomed to decide without deigning to rea&s;on, have invented and appro|priated to their own proper u&s;e. I do not mean to affirm there is no truth in the&s;e re|marks: I am, perhaps, the per&s;on lea&s;t qua|lified of any to pronounce, with &s;afety, on the merits or demerits of the work. Fathers, who are the mo&s;t free from prejudice, cannot &s;ee
<PB N="iv" REF="4">tho&s;e defects in their offspring, which are obvious to others. In the rapidity of compo|&s;ition, blemi&s;hes are &s;uffered to e&s;cape, through a laudable attention to things of greater im|portance; and, like an ugly face, pre&s;ently become too familiar to be di&s;gu&s;ting. It is, for this rea&s;on, dangerous to commit any thing to paper, which the judgment, at the fir&s;t perception, condemns. A work of any con&s;equence is read and recon&s;idered &s;o re|peatedly, that the ideas at la&s;t lo&s;e both novelty and force, and the writer is di&s;gu&s;ted to find tho&s;e things, which, when fir&s;t con|ceived, gave him &s;o much plea&s;ure, become vapid, and a&s;&s;ume the appearance of common place. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I &s;ay, it would be arrogant in me to &s;peak decidedly; I can only alledge what were my original motives for writing as I have done.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Comic Drama has long been renowned for humour; and when, about fourteen years ago, the French <HI>Com&eacute;die Lar|moyante,</HI> or, as we call it, Sentimental Comedy, was introduced, the complaint was, that we had lo&s;t all the &s;pirit of our old writers, and were dwindled into mere tran&s;|lators. The town was in this temper when Dr. Gold&s;inith's Comedy of SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER was produced, in which, humour, alone, &s;eems to be the chief intention of the Author, and which gave a fatal blow to mere &s;entimental dialogue. The &s;ucce&s;s of this
<PB N="v" REF="5">piece rouzed later writers from the &s;oft &s;lum|bers of the heart, and wit and humour be|came commodities in great reque&s;t. The road to fame, though difficult, was obvious; and it would have been unpardonable for a young traveller, at his fir&s;t out-&s;et, &s;o far to have mi&s;taken, as not to have attempted it. The difficulties and dangers have increa&s;ed, how|ever, in a va&s;t proportion. I need only men|tion the SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL; and every di&s;cerning critic will immediately recollect how, and why.</P>
<P>In the Comedy of DUPLICITY, the '&s;quire and his &s;i&s;ter are characters that, in their own nature, cannot admit of delicate &s;trokes; and, if I have erred, it is not, I believe, &s;o much in the colouring, as in the choice of my &s;ubject. An Author in his fir&s;t attempt, is &s;eldom impre&s;&s;ed with that awe for the Public which is requi&s;ite, but ventures many things, that, perhaps, have their excellencies in reading, but that appear rude, abrupt, or indelicate, when pronounced before a large a&s;&s;embly. Were the humour of Smollet, which never fails to excite laughter in the clo&s;et, &s;poken upon the &s;tage, it would fre|quently excite univer&s;al di&s;gu&s;t. Characters of broad humour are become peculiarly ha|zardous, becau&s;e they are become far le&s;s fre|quent. A &s;en&s;e of propriety &s;preads in pro|portion as people read, and reading is an infallible con&s;equence of riches. This pro|duced
<PB N="vi" REF="6">duces delicate &s;en&s;ations in tho&s;e who have acquired &s;uch a &s;trict &s;en&s;e of propriety, and they are offended when they &s;ee things repre|&s;ented on the &s;tage which, they &s;uppo&s;e, do not exi&s;t in real life; though there are a thou&s;and living characters, a thou&s;and incidents at which, if exhibited, an audience would revolt, merely on the &s;core of improbability.</P>
<P>Whatever the execution may have been, the intention of this Comedy is of a far nobler nature than the mere incitement of ri&s;ibility: the vice it pretends to correct is become truly enormous; and I would rather have the merit of driving one man from the gaming-table, than of making a whole theatre merry.</P>
<P>I have, likewi&s;e, been accu&s;ed by &s;ome of imitation, and want of originality. It is &s;aid, I have &s;tolen an incident from one piece, and a character from another, and that it is evi|dently the play of a player. This la&s;t re|mark, I believe, would never have been made, had I not been known to be a player. The accu&s;ations, which have the greate&s;t appear|ance of truth, are, that LE DISSIPATEUR of Mon&s;ieur De&s;touches, and the Tragedy of THE GAMESTER, have furni&s;hed the great outlines of the plot. To the&s;e I an&s;wer, that, were it &s;o, I would make no &s;cruple of avowing it, becau&s;e I &s;hould not think my|&s;elf degraded by the avowal; but I declare the plot was fini&s;hed, and almo&s;t the comedy,
<PB N="vii" REF="7">before I ever read LE DISSIPATEUR: and if I have pillaged the GAMESTER, it was from latent ideas, of which I am uncon&s;cious; for I have neither read, nor &s;een the GAMES|TER for many years. A parallel circum&s;tance to that of Sir Harry lo&s;ing his &s;i&s;ter's fortune, is found, I am told, in the GAMESTER; but this incident was added to DUPLICITY &s;ince it was fir&s;t written, by the advice of a friend, to give a &s;trength to the denoument. But there is a &s;tory told in the life of Beau Na&s;h, which, had the&s;e critics known, would have immediately pointed out the place whence, they might have &s;worn, without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of perjury, I had &s;tolen my plot; and yet, had they &s;worn, they would have been perjured, for I never read that &s;tory till I had written my Play, and then, I confe&s;s, I was amazed at the &s;imilarity.</P>
<P>However, I repeat, had I taken my plot from any play or &s;tory, I &s;hould have made no &s;cruple to confe&s;s it, becau&s;e I think it no di&s;grace. The fir&s;t of all poets invented none of his plots; I &s;hall never be the &s;econd, and yet I affirm I did invent mine; that is, as far as I my&s;elf am con&s;cious. The elegant Bi&s;hop Hurd, in his di&s;cour&s;e on Poetical Imitation, has the following remark, among many others, which is applicable to the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion: <Q>The objects of imitation, like the materials of human knowledge, are a common &s;tock which experience
<PB N="vii" REF="8">furni&s;hes to all men; and it is in the ope|rations of the mind upon them that the glory of poetry, as of &s;cience, con&s;i&s;ts. Here the genius of the poet hath room to &s;hew it&s;elf, and from hence, alone, is the prai&s;e of originality to be a&s;certained.</Q></P>
<P>The Comedy is now committed to the im|partial judgment of the true critic; and I have only to wi&s;h, it may receive as favourable a &s;entence from him, as it has already expe|rienced from the voice of an indulgent Public.</P>

<SPEAKER>Meli&s;&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt of it. The attention which Mr. O&s;borne has &s;hewn me, was not that of a man eager to gain the affection of his mi&s;|tre&s;s by humouring her caprices, prai&s;ing her beauty, and flattering her follies. He is obliging and well-bred, but &s;incere; yet his di&s;approbation is delivered with a delicacy that makes it more agreeable than &s;ome people's compliments.</P>

<P>If time, in&s;tead of mellowing the &s;trokes, &s;hould wear away this &s;mooth varni&s;h and di&s;|cover a har&s;h outline, &s;hould you not be offended at the &s;everity of his manner, think you?</P>

<P>Believe me, dear Clara, there is no danger; for if there be one man on earth more capable of making a woman happy than another it is Mr. O&s;borne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be here&s;y in you, my dear, to hold any other opinion; and I have no doubt but you will continue orthodox after marriage.</P>

<P>Yes&mdash;I &s;hall certainly die in that faith.</P>

<P>Never. You know my acquaintance with your family is but ju&s;t begun; but, I hope, you will not think them words of cour&s;e when I a&s;&s;ure you that, &s;hort as it is, I feel my&s;elf in|tere&s;ted in its happine&s;s.</P>

<P>Oh! I am &s;ure you are &s;incere&mdash;I know it by &s;ympathy&mdash;Well then, I'll tell you&mdash;Harry and O&s;borne happened to be both abroad at the &s;ame time. As my brother was going to Italy, and pa&s;&s;ing through the mountainous part of Sa|voy, he came to a hollow way, among the rocks, &s;urrounded by trees and caverns. All on a &s;ud|den, at a turning in the road, he beheld O&s;borne, and his &s;ervants, attacked by &s;ix banditti, and ready to &s;ink under their wounds.</P>

<P>He had his governor, two &s;ervants, and the po&s;tillion&mdash;My brother in&s;tantly leaped from his carriage, &s;natched up his &s;word and pi&s;tols, andflew to the place of action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declare you terrify me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Meli&s;&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was not &s;een by the combatants, and took care to advance &s;o near, before he
<PB N="3" REF="13">fired, that he could not fail to do execution&mdash;He laid two of the banditti dead; and their com|panions, who had di&s;charged their fire-arms, and beheld Sir Harry's people running to the attack and levelling their pieces, fled.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you for that, my dear&mdash;you have given me breath.</P>

<P>The intrepidity with which Sir Harry &s;aw O&s;borne defend him&s;elf, and the fortitude he di&s;covered when he was informed, as it was at fir&s;t believed, that his wounds were mortal, at|tached my brother &s;o powerfully to him, that he re&s;olved not to leave him in the hands of &s;trangers, but anxiou&s;ly waited while he was under cure.</P>

<P>This was a noble genero&s;ity!</P>

<SPEAKER>Meli&s;&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was; and O&s;borne was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it that, though he was going the other way, he would return with Sir Harry into Italy; and their friend&s;hip has continued ever &s;ince.</P>

<P>So it appears, madam&mdash;And I was too much enraptured to &s;tay to rectify mi&s;takes&mdash;when I negotiated the affair with 'Squire Turnbull, I &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided an interview with his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;i&s;ter, for fear the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould wear a face of precipitate indelicacy.&mdash;And I thought if I could once bring you and Sir Harry together, I would leave the contingent po&s;&s;ibilities to love, and the &s;uperior good qualities and penetration of the par|ties,

<P>Why faith, madam, I had been &s;o particular with you, and had &s;poken &s;o freely on the &s;ubjects of love and matrimony, that I was afraid, if I made tho&s;e kind of enquiries, you would mi&s;take the matter, perhaps, and think I wanted to make love to you in my own proper per&s;on.
