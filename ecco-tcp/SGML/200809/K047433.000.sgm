<SP>
<LG>
<L>To gain the public ear, the man of rhimes</L>
<L>Should always &s;peak the language of the times;</L>
<L>And little el&s;e hath been of late in hearing</L>
<L>Than terms and phra&s;es of Electioneering.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our author therefore &s;ends me to a&s;&s;ure ye,</L>
<L>Worthy and free electors of Old Drury,</L>
<L>How happy he &s;hould prove, if it content you,</L>
<L>That he be one of tho&s;e who repre&s;ent you;</L>
<L>The &s;tate <HI>Poetic,</HI> laws and legi&s;lature,</L>
<L>Like the <HI>Political</HI> in form and nature;</L>
<L>Phoebus, the Nine, and Bards of reputation</L>
<L>King, Peerage, Commons, of the &s;cribbling nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from Parna&s;&s;us' throne the Prince of Wit,</L>
<L>It &s;eems, hath i&s;&s;ued out his royal writ</L>
<L>For a new member.&mdash;No offence to give</L>
<L>To a late worthy repre&s;entative;</L>
<L>Who, ris'n to favour, hath from us retreated,</L>
<L>And 'mong&s;t the Lords of t'other hou&s;e is &s;eated, &mdash;</L>
<L>His &s;ervice lo&s;t, pre&s;uming you may need him,</L>
<L>The pre&s;ent candidate would fain &s;ucceed him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that he vainly boa&s;ts, on this occa&s;ion,</L>
<L>He met encouragement from your per&s;ua&s;ion;</L>
<L>Or that both friends, who love, and foes, who hate him,</L>
<L>Have been unanimous to nominate him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis for this loyal borough his affection,</L>
<L>And patriot zeal, that make him ri&s;k th' election;</L>
<L>To his con&s;tituents &s;ubject to controul;</L>
<L>With who&s;e good leave, he means to &s;tand the poll;</L>
<L>Tru&s;ting &s;ecure to their impartial choice:</L>
<L>The town uncanva&s;s'd for a &s;ingle voice;</L>
<L>Nay, brib'd no brother burge&s;s bard of note,</L>
<L>Nor by corruption gain'd one critick's vote.</L>

<L>Too proud to beg, too mode&s;t to demand,</L>
<L>By merit only would he fall or &s;tand:</L>
<L>Nor enmity nor friend&s;hip interfering,</L>
<L>He only a&s;ks a fair and candid hearing.</L>
<L>If, after that, you &s;hould with &s;corn reject him,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mineral.</SPEAKER>
<P>IS there any thing in the papers, Barri&s;ter?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but medical no&s;trums, and li&s;ts of idle company at the&s;e watering places.&mdash;One would think the whole kingdom was infected with the plague.</P>
<STAGE>[Giving <HI>Mineral</HI> the news-paper.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>With two at lea&s;t, credulity, and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>By both which, doctor we thrive, and have therefore no rea&s;on to complain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that:mdash;they are u&s;eful indeed, to you liberal adventurers, who depend on tre doc|trine of chances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and to you medical adventurers too. The practice of phy&s;ick depends as much on the doctrine of chances as that of gaming. Be&s;ides, cre|dulity breeds quacks, as di&s;&s;ipation does game&s;ters; and both may become too general for us regular practitioners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may &s;o;&mdash;but you &s;eem, Barri&s;ter, to have thrown up the cards, with regard to public parties at lea&s;t;&mdash;you play a higher game, I &s;uppo&s;e, in private; eh!&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, cards and dice are but paultry tools in the hands of a real arti&s;t. The pa&s;&s;ions and foibles of mankind are not only more effectual, but more entertaining implements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, &mdash;but you can play upon them at the card-table; I have &s;een you do it, Barri&s;ter; I have &s;een you do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, when you were at the &s;ame game, doctor?&mdash;Ah! You &s;piders of the faculty &s;pin your thread as fine as any of the fraternity; woe be to the poor flies that are entangled in your web.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but we phy&s;icians do let our patients recover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;ometimes; as we game&s;ters let novices win, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on; to hook them only deeper into play. Do you ever cure any body of coming to Bath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be &s;ure, we have &s;ome regard to the pro&s;perity of the corporation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to your own doctor.&mdash;Every crazy con&s;titution that arrives, becomes to you phy&s;icians a good annuity; a copyhold inheritance, of which you are tenants for life. For your own &s;akes, there|fore, you mu&s;t keep the tottering tenements from tumbling. But that's all: if you patch them up to &s;tand wind and weather, from &s;ea&s;on to &s;ea&s;on, it is as much as you require. A thorough repair might bring on a writ of ejectment, and undo you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Barri&s;ter, you are now too &s;evere; do you think the faculty quite void of the milk of human kindne&s;s? Have we no nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>The milk of human kindne&s;s, ha! ha! ha! &mdash;Yes, yes, you make a fine milch cow of poor na|ture indeed.&mdash;But come let us hear: who are our new comers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, let us &s;ee&mdash; <STAGE>[Reads the news-paper.]</STAGE>&mdash; arrived &s;ince our la&s;t, the duke and duche&s;s of Dangle-court; the earl and counte&s;s of Squander-field; count Splenetic; baron Podagra; lord and lady Dupe; lord Courtly.&mdash;O, pray, is not that he, who had &s;uch an ill run the la&s;t meeting at New-market?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ame;&mdash;&s;ix thou&s;and upon Gimcrack, and four upon Silver-Legs;&mdash;faith the turf was a little cruel to him, con&s;idering the &s;tate of his fi|nances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I &s;uppo&s;e he has now mortgaged his e&s;tate, and is come to take his revenge of New-market races, on the rooms at Bath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entre nous, doctor, his e&s;tate was dipped before: but let that go no farther. I am under obliga|tions to his lord&s;hip, and have the honour of his confi|dence.&mdash;Have we any more of the right honourables?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, &mdash;but commoners, like herrings at Shet|land in &s;hoals.&mdash; <STAGE>[Reads again.]</STAGE> Sir Peregrine Peevi&s;h, and lady; Mr. alderman Lombard; Mr. and Mrs. Fretful; the two Mi&s;s Drinkwaters, Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s Ricketty; and &s;o on, with Mr. and Mrs; Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s, to the end of the catalogue.&mdash;Do you know any of the&s;e I have mentioned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the alderman is con&s;igned to me: do you know him?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very well. I was called in when he was la&s;t at Bath, and &s;ound him laid up with the gout. We &s;et him upon his legs again with difficulty, in a month. But the boi&s;terous wretch &s;wore our &s;ees were &s;o exorbitant, that he would hobble upon crutches through the ward of Cripplegate all his life|time,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
&s;ooner than be &s;o fleeced again, by any water-doctors in Chri&s;tendom.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! well &s;aid Mr. Alderman, you mu&s;t know he is a kind of wit.&mdash;He is come down now to &s;tand candidate for a vacant borough here in the We&s;t: to which he is gone over, to &s;hew him&s;elf to the con&s;tituents.&mdash;He is recommended to me by our old friend Scrutiny Canva&s;s, of Lincoln's-Inn; who tells me the curmudgeon rolls in wealth, and, though covetous as a mi&s;er in any laudable pur&s;uit, is lavi&s;h as a prodigal in the pro&s;ecution of any ab&s;urd project of his own; at pre&s;ent, it &s;eems, he is di&s;|po&s;ed to empty his coffers to get into parliament; &s;o that if money will effect it, he is in a fair way of be|coming a limb of the legi&s;lative body of Great-Britain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a lame one he is likely to prove; how|ever, I wi&s;h you &s;ucce&s;s with him.&mdash;Egad, here he comes.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I expected. He was to meet me here, on his return, to &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s of the canva&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well;&mdash;I &s;hall only ju&s;t renew my acquaint|ance, and take leave of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I believe you need not withdraw. I &s;hall affect no &s;ecrets; for whenever a man wants to take the advantage of another, his &s;ure&s;t mode of de|ception is the appearance of openne&s;s and plain-dealing.</P>

<P>Mr. Lombard your mo&s;t ob&s;equious.&mdash;I hope I have the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee you well.</P>

<P>Oh, your &s;ervant, doctor, your &s;ervant.&mdash; Tolerably well, I thank you; my &s;upporters are pretty &s;tout at pre&s;ent, if you can reap any &s;atisfaction from &s;eeing that.&mdash;I do from feeling it, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

<P>It will be well for you if you are not made a wor&s;e, con&s;idering how much better hands you have fallen into.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd you think it, Squire Furnival, when I was here two years ago, this worthy phy&s;ician and his a&s;&s;ociates had the con&s;cience to take above a hun|dred guineas of me, only for coaxing the cramp out of my great toe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>A violent paroxy&s;m of the gout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gave it that formidable name indeed, to enhance the merit of your pre&s;criptions; but what did you admini&s;ter but a dozen or two of in|nocent &s;lip &s;lops, and as many gallons of in&s;ipid warm water?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir! Mr. Lombard's was a bad ca&s;e, a very bad ca&s;e indeed! we had frequent con&s;ultations of the faculty upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, my ca&s;e was a bad one &s;ure enough; for, while you and your accomplices had your hand in my pur&s;e, and merited the di&s;cipline of the hor&s;e-pond, you hurried me without mercy to be duck'd and pump'd like a pick-pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to be &s;arca&s;tical, Mr. Lom|bard; but when the &s;it returns, I &s;hall find you of a

different opinion. So, 'till then, your mo&s;t ob&s;equi|ous humble &s;ervant.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! good day to you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry, Mr. Alderman, you were &s;o &s;evere on my friend Mineral. The doctor has more intere&s;t in the borough of Gluttonbury, than, you imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>He cures the mayor and aldermen of at lea&s;t a dozen &s;urfeits in a year. They cannot po&s;&s;ibly live without him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Od&s;o, I am &s;orry for that: and yet I am partly glad of it too; as you &s;ay he is your friend, you may ea&s;ily excu&s;e my raillery;&mdash;tell him it is my way, &mdash;that's an excu&s;e for any thing, you know: or, egad, for the matter of that, if I thought 'twou'd &s;ecure him in our intere&s;t, I'd be taken with a &s;light touch of the gout to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not ju&s;t now, Mr. Alderman, if you plea&s;e. Electioneering is bu&s;tling work, and if we &s;hou'd be hard run, you may have a u&s;e for your feet, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;well, &mdash;I have been to Gluttonbury!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope to good purpo&s;e, Mr. Alderman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I am afraid, to very little. You &s;hall judge. As I was quite a &s;tranger in the place, I naturally inquired, you know, for the mayor of the corporation; who received me kindly enough for a &s;tranger, and civilly offered to call a meeting of the principal town's-people the next day. Accordingly I got a &s;peech ready for them at my inn, over night, and met his wor&s;hip, with Mr. recorder, and the re&s;t, in the town-hall, in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o far &s;o good: but you &s;hall hear.&mdash; I a&s;&s;ured them, as u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions, of my firm attachment to my king and country in general, and of my regard for Gluttonbury in particular.&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="10">
Then I talked to them a good deal about the con&s;ti|tution, and the revolution, and the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and all that;&mdash;giving them, now and then, a little liberty and property, trade and pro&s;perity, and &s;o forth: and, egad upon the whole, I thought I acquitted my&s;elf with energy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what effect had it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No effect at all, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;urprize me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No effect at all in the world, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you. You may well be &s;urprized, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, its not &s;o very &s;urprizing neither: Oratory, like every thing el&s;e, has its day. We have &s;een &s;ome of our greate&s;t &s;peakers talk them&s;elves out of breath, till they talked them&s;elves out of credit. For, after all, words are but wind, you know, Mr. Alderman.&mdash;Had you no bank-pape rabout you? a written plea has &s;ometimes a better effect than one delivered viva voce; not all the rhetorical flouri&s;hes of Cicero and Demo&s;thenes put together, have half the pathos of the plain hand-writing of three or four petty clerks in Thread-needle-&s;treet;&mdash;bank-notes, bank-notes, Mr. Lombard, are now a-days, the only prevailing arguments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Mr. Furnival, I begin to think we citizens don't rightly under&s;tand the&s;e matters.&mdash;You gentlemen of the law know how to go about them much better. For my part, I own it is a little out of my way. All I can &s;ay therefore is, that if you will undertake the canva&s;s, you &s;hall want no mate|rials, that I can furni&s;h.&mdash;But, &mdash;pray, what is my rival candidate? He is a man of war, I find;&mdash;does he carry any weight of metal?&mdash;Has he the &s;ummum bonum about him? ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems he has a good e&s;tate, Sir, be&s;ides his commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He bears a very great character in the neighbourhood. They tell me he is a patriot, a
<PB N="8" REF="11">
man of public &s;pirit, one who&s;e motto is Dulce e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> decorum&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;pro patria morum. Ha! Mr. Furnival. Ay, I remember the pa&s;&s;age;&mdash;I have con&s;trued it formerly at Merchant-Taylor's;&mdash;tho', by the way, I remember I thought it mighty &s;illy, even in tho&s;e days. Die for one's country! ha, ha, ha!&mdash;That might be patrioti&s;m among the ancient Romans; but we modern patriots live upon our country, Mr. Fur|nival. Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! very well, very well, indeed, Mr. Lombard.&mdash;But, as to men of your antagoni&s;t's profe&s;&s;ion, they are bound in honour, you know, to die at the word of command without grumbling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, coun&s;ellor, right:&mdash;But what&mdash;he has a regiment, &mdash;he is a colonel, I think!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bloody-minded colonel, I a&s;&s;ure you, Mr. Lombard; one who makes it his boa&s;t, that he is ready to &s;pill the la&s;t drop in his veins, in defence of his con&s;tituents. He'll bleed for 'em, Mr. Lom|bard.</P>

<P>So, cou&s;in Sophy! your papa, I find, is arrived at Bath; we &s;hall now &s;ee what account you will give of your&s;elf, for having contracted a violent inclination for a man without his knowledge; and that too for a man whom he never &s;aw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I contract a violent inclination for a man, Narci&s;&s;a! what, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e Colonel Camply has repeated his vi&s;its pretty frequently of late!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, it is too late to retract now. It is to no purpo&s;e to play the prude with me, or the co-quet with him any longer. Have not you &s;aid an hundred times, that you preferred colonel Camply to all the men in the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t have talked in my &s;leep then, Nar|ci&s;&s;a: for I am certain my tongue never &s;o betrayed my heart while I was waking.</P>

<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;haw, that's provoking now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! a little &s;lip of that &s;ame tongue, my dear. &mdash; But, make your&s;elf ea&s;y; for waking or &s;leeping, I believe it is very innocent of betraying your regard for colonel Camply, my in|formation is founded on better authority, I a&s;&s;ure you. Tho&s;e &s;peaking eyes of yours, Sophy, are apter tell-tales.&mdash;What you reckon nothing, it &s;eems, on the &s;ignificant nods, expre&s;&s;ive &s;miles, and lan|gui&s;hing looks, the colonel and you have been re|ciprocally exchanging, the&s;e three months pa&s;t.&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<P>Go, go, you are a giddy girl, Narci&s;&s;a.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you a &s;ober, &s;tay'd, prudent, unmar|ried gentlewoman, ju&s;t turn'd of twenty! Prithee ca&s;t off this formality of countenance, and leave it to the wear of mincing abigails, and maiden aunts, with their other weather-beaten remnants of anti|quity. I tell you it does not at all become a girl hardly out of her teens, and little older than my&s;elf. Believe me, tho&s;e who affect to be grave when they are young, will be glad to be merry when they are old; excu&s;e me, my dear, but I am a little in &s;pirits this morning.</P>
</SP>

<P>Indeed you have always an a&s;toni&s;hing flow of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not, I?&mdash;Well, but come? How is it to be? The colonel will break the matter, I &s;up|po&s;e, to your father; the bargain will be &s;truck, the
<PB N="10" REF="13">
match hu&s;tled up, cloaths bought, jewels pre&s;ented, and the day fix'd immediately. I &s;hall be all impa|tience till it be &s;ettled, and we &s;tand up to dance at your wedding. I have not had a country dance, no not this half century, as lady Pedigree &s;ays.</P>

<P>And yet this bu&s;ine&s;s, which you &s;eem to have di&s;patched &s;o expeditiou&s;ly, may be longer in &s;ettling than you imagine, if, indeed, it be ever &s;ettled at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! What's the matter now? Your lover and you are, I am &s;ure, &s;o far agreed, that you need only tell each other your minds; if you have not done it already. He has a fine fortune of his own, and is &s;atisfied with yours, though not a penny be added to your grandfather's legacy. And then your papa, who loves you &s;o tenderly as to &s;ee you once a year, and write to you by &s;ome of his clerks once a quarter, will hardly plead paternal fondne&s;s, to keep you longer on his hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how it will be. There is like to be a &s;trange revolution in my father's affairs. I learn he is going to be married him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Him&s;elf! well, but I hope he'll be &s;o good as to &s;ee you married fir&s;t.</P>

<P>At the &s;ame time, I &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, to &s;ave charges; for I hear he has partly made up a match for me with &s;ome noble lord.&mdash;</P>

</SP>

<P>And do you &s;igh for that, Sophy? Now for my part, were I in your ca&s;e, I &s;hould think it mighty clever; that is, on a &s;uppo&s;ition the lord were de&s;erving of the lady. For as you have no violent inclination, you know, for colonel Camply, it is an ea&s;y matter to break through a &s;light one for a private gentleman, in favour of a peer.&mdash;O gad, that I had but an independent fortune of thirty thou|&s;and pounds, as you have, and that two or three of the&s;e lords wou'd pay their court to me!</P>

<P>Yes, if I lik'd them well enough.

<P>I don't &s;ay that.&mdash;I have not the vanity to compare Mr. Melmoth, my Sir Frederic that may be, to the flower of the Briti&s;h nobility; tho' I own I would not exchange him for the be&s;t of the bunch of baronets.&mdash;But yonder comes the colonel, in his u&s;ual &s;orrowful &s;aunter, with his hands in his bo&s;om, and &s;uch a penitential countenance! What, in the name of wonder, can be the matter with him now? Had you a quarrel with him la&s;t night? Did he win of you at cards, tear the mount of your fan, tread upon the train of your new &s;ack, or make a loud whi&s;per of a &s;ecret that has been publicly talked of among your acquaintance for the&s;e four months?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Prithee, what can that be, Narci&s;&s;a?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh! the old &s;tory, man's con&s;tancy and woman's caprice, the &s;ubject of half the love &s;ongs and halfpenny ballads that has been chanted &s;ince Cupid was an arch wag, and his mother an errant jilt. Upon my word, Sophy, you &s;ometimes treat that poor gentleman very ill; and if you don't be|have more con&s;i&s;tently, I will as &s;urely tell him, as it is true, that your cruelty is all affected; that you are as much in love with him, as he is with you; and, in &s;hort, that you doat on him to ab&s;urdity.&mdash; Therefore look to it, Sophy, look to it.</P>

<P>I am fearful, my dear, le&s;t it &s;hould offend nobody &s;o much as your&s;elf. When I was of your age, I was ju&s;t &s;uch another wild unthinking thing as you are. Carele&s;s of cen&s;ure, and pre|&s;umptuous that while I pre&s;erved my innocence, I might laugh at decorum, as mere formality; but the world is come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, Narci&s;&s;a, that vir|tue it&s;elf is often of le&s;s con&s;equence to the peace and happine&s;s of our lives than the appearance of it.

<P>And in what do I appear &s;o heinou&s;ly guilty, madam? In laughing at the rueful dejection of the poor colonel, or in giving encouragement to the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Melmoth, to whom you have never before made any objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, my dear, I have hitherto made none, becau&s;e I wou'd not a&s;&s;ume too great an influence over you, in making a choice of &s;o much
<PB N="15" REF="18">
importance to the future happine&s;s of your life. But I &s;hou'd but ill di&s;charge the duty of a mother, Nar|ci&s;&s;a, if I did not confe&s;s, and that without any par|ticular objection to Mr. Melmoth, that I think you would be much happier with my lord Courtly, who hath made the faire&s;t offers, and of who&s;e regard for you, I am now more than ever convinced.</P>

<P>Well, my dear, I only &s;peak my &s;en|timents. I have no objection to your engaging the affections or encouraging the addre&s;&s;es of any de|&s;erving lover; but I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on your indulging your&s;elf le&s;s in raillery, at the expence of your friends.</P>

<P>But I &s;hou'd think, Madam, one's friends would be the lea&s;t apt to take offence, and that the behaviour you complain of might be a good method to put their friend&s;hip to the proof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think wrong, Narci&s;&s;a. I know, by woful experience, the danger of trifling with a heart that loves one. It was this fatal indi&s;|cretion in me that gave ri&s;e to a groundle&s;s jealou&s;y in the brea&s;t of the fonde&s;t of hu&s;bands, and de|prived you of the tender affections of a father.</P>

<P>I am indeed greatly concerned for it, colonel: for though I am but a di&s;tant relation to him, he is perhaps the neare&s;t now living to me.&mdash; Be&s;ides, I am bound to it, in gratitude to his father; to who&s;e friend&s;hip I was much indebted for my own &s;ucce&s;s in life. Nay, I am not only obliged to Sir John Melmoth for my fortune, but even for his name; which I long ago a&s;&s;umed, on my departure from Europe.</P>

<P>Why, as you &s;ay, if his lord&s;hip has the electors of Gluttonbury under his thumb, and is looking out for a wife, I don't know that we could both do better than to make up a match between him and my daughter Sophy. For, as I am al&s;o going to marry again, a daughter by a fir&s;t wife will be a kind of incumbrance on the family, you know. I had partly agreed indeed with lord Sweep&s;takes, to take her off my hands for &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;The girl has thirty of her own; left her by her grand|Father.&mdash;</P>

<P>Of the &s;ame rank, I grant you; but a vi&s;|count is as much preferable to a baron as &s;even pearls on a coronet are to four, which is almo&s;t two to one: &s;o that the odds in a match with lord Courtly will be greatly in your favour.</P>

<P>True, Mr. Alderman, therefore &s;tand upon no ceremony with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't, my lord, I won't: for though your lord&s;hip may be a great man at court, I am a great man in the city: and the courtiers and citizens have always been upon a footing, to carry on a &s;muggling trade together.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the arts of pin-making and the ma|nufacturing of thimbles, ha! ha! ha! No, my lad, no; the&s;e have been long ago trundled down in the broad-wheeled waggons to Birmingham; to make room for architecture, painting, paving, and &s;culp|ture</P>

<P>Sculpture! Mr. Alderman! &s;ure the grim &s;avages at St. Dun&s;tan's &s;till &s;tand centinel, to &s;trike the hours on the clock!&mdash;Then the giants in Guild|hall look as tremendous as ever?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take care, Furnival, of making my ho|nour a cloak for your knavery: you have done it too often, even to the wearing it &s;o threadbare, that, if I were not kept in countenance by the example of other per&s;ons of rank, I &s;hould be really a&s;hamed of my&s;elf.</P>

<P>You will excu&s;e me, my lord, if I am mi&s;|taken, as I don't mean to be impertinent: but I own I conceived, that either your lord&s;hip's con&s;titution or e&s;tate might, by this time, have &s;ugge&s;ted the ex|pediency of your entering again into the &s;tate of ma|trimony.

<P>Well, Syllogi&s;m, who hath called &s;ince. I have been out.&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody, Sir;&mdash;I expected to have been able to pre&s;ent your honour with at lea&s;t a hundred vi&s;it|ing cards, full of compliments of condolance: but I find the world is not &s;o impertinent; it civily chu&s;es to leave people under misfortunes to comfort them|&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the improved mode of good man|ners, Syllogi&s;m, not to be trouble&s;ome. You &s;eem, however, to &s;tand in need of con&s;olation! what's
<PB N="51" REF="54">
the meaning of this? It is not above an hour or two ago &s;ince you braved the &s;torns of fortune with the fortitude of a &s;toick, and recommended patience to me with the eloquence of a Seneca.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but, like Seneca too, I find I cou'd preach that to others which I cannot practice my&s;elf. But &s;urely, Sir, I may conclude, from the plea&s;antry of your pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, that what you heard in the morning cannot be true!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>True! Syllogi&s;m. How &s;hou'd it be true, when you know you ob&s;erved it to be impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but Sir, joking apart, if your father be dead, how do you intend to live, now he has di&s;|inherited you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall do the be&s;t: to &s;upply my wants by indu&s;try. I &s;hall find friends to put me in a way, and am only &s;orry it will be out of my power to reward your &s;idelity as it de&s;erves</P>

<P>Nay, Sir, make your&s;elf ea&s;y about me; a philo&s;opher is ea&s;ily provided for. Jacta e&s;t alea, Sir. When I have the misfortune to leave your &s;ervice, I devote my&s;elf immediately to that of the mu&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, turn poet! then art thou con|demned to be poor as long as thou live&s;t. Why, the poverty of poets, man, is notorious; it hath been a hackneyed je&s;t for ages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, it hath been hackneyed &s;o long, that it is fairly worn out. When poets had no patrons but the great, the poor devils, &s;ure enough, were obliged to live upon little: but &s;ince the publick have taken them under their protection, a bard, like another man, may have two coats to his back, and every thing hand&s;ome about him.</P>

<P>And yet, Syllogi&s;m, 'till the lawyers can decide the di&s;pute about literary property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you, Sir, that a freehold on Parna&s;&s;us does not intitle the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to vote for member of parliament; but let a man of genius once merit the

favour of the town, and he may levy contributions on it, whenever his affairs require it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Levy contributions! is not that too ar|bitrary? I thought the convocation of criticks had &s;omething to do in the &s;y&s;tem of literary legi&s;lation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, they are the lower hou&s;e, and have the privilege of deciding in all money-matters. They hold their &s;e&s;&s;ions in the pit, at the repre&s;entation of every new play, and proceed directly to the con&s;ider|ation of ways and means.&mdash;To be &s;ure, Sir, we can|not rai&s;e a &s;hilling without the con&s;ent of the hou&s;e.&mdash;But if they approve the bill, they pa&s;s it with a plau|dit, and their genero&s;ity is boundle&s;s.</P>

<P>Well, Syllogi&s;m, if you are obliged to go upon the town, I can only wi&s;h you &s;ucce&s;s: but perhaps you may be better provided for, yet: in the mean time, you mu&s;t not leave me abruptly&mdash;I &s;hall want your &s;ervice, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, I am going a journey of three hundred miles an end; will you go with me, if I &s;hould have occa&s;ion for you?</P>

<P>Alas! heaven knows!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fruitle&s;s as unhappy! for though my heart was &s;omething lighter, from knowing he had recovered of the wounds I had given him; yet I &s;hou'd have much ea&s;ier &s;upported the reflection of having killed an adulterer, than that of having in|jured, abandoned, and perhaps ultimately de&s;troyed, am innocent wife and daughter.</P>

<P>Yes, Narci&s;&s;a, that long-lo&s;t father, whom you have heard me &s;o often lament, is now in Bath.

<P>Ladies and gentlemen your &s;ervant. Hap|pily a&s;&s;embled, I hope.&mdash;[turning to Young Melmoth.]&mdash; I pre&s;ume, Mr. Melmoth is, by this time, convinc'd of the impropriety of the angry billet he &s;ent me this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mi&s;take we both lay under, my lord, at once ju&s;tifies your behaviour and my re&s;entment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortunately for me, however, that mi&s;take drew a promi&s;e from the amiable Narci&s;&s;a; which, I flatter my&s;elf, &s;he is too generous to forget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, my lord, I did promi&s;e to give you my hand, if Mr. Melmoth could not accept it: and, if you had come &s;ome few minutes ago, I &s;hould have been terribly puzzl'd what to &s;ay to you. But I can now keep my word, without your reaping any advantage from my promi&s;e.&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam! Mrs. Mildmay, what have I to hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my lord, my pre&s;ent perplex|ity of joy and &s;urprize, makes me as incapable of ex|pre&s;&s;ing my obligations, as the event puts it out of my power to requite them. Narci&s;&s;a is not Mr. Mel|moth's &s;i&s;ter; but, in&s;tead of a brother, &s;he hath found a father, and I a hu&s;band; to who&s;e guidance and protection we now are &s;ubject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your leave then, madam, Mr. Mel|moth &s;hall be yet your &s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then have I found, in&s;tead of lo&s;t, a father.</P>
<STAGE>[Bowing to general Melmoth, who advances to embrace him.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the preference I once gave your lord&s;hip&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>It lays me under an obligation, madam, that, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, makes all apology needle&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generou&s;ly &s;aid; is not it, Mr. Melmoth? &mdash;Indeed, my lord, I wi&s;h you a better wife than I &s;hould have made you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I you, madam, all happine&s;s, with a hu&s;band that de&s;erves you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to merit the compliment, my lord.</P>

<STAGE>Enter alderman <HI>Lombard,</HI> colonel <HI>Camply</HI> and <HI>Sophia.</HI></STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;ervant, gentlemen and ladies. You &s;eem to be mighty well pleas'd here: my daughter Sophy and the colonel have let me a little into &s;ome|thing&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Camply! oh, my friend, behold my injur'd, much-wrong'd wife and daughter!</P>

<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible!</P>

<P>How, how! the widow Mildmay general Melmoth's wife!</P>

<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee you're fill'd with wonder! I could indeed, relate a tale mo&s;t wonderful, but that exce&s;s of joy prevents its utterance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, we'll wait, general, 'till you are a little more &s;orrowful.&mdash;In the mean time, I mu&s;t in|form you, that I have &s;ettled matters with your friend Camply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, my daughter and the borough go together. There, take her, colonel; and make her ju&s;t as good a hu&s;band as &s;he proves a wife&mdash;for my own part, I &s;hall defer my matrimonial project to another opportunity: and, I think, it would not be ami&s;s if his lord&s;hip follows my example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I hope I &s;hall always have genero&s;ity of temper enough, to rejoice in the happine&s;s of others, though not directly conducive to my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such a di&s;po&s;ition, my lord, cannot go long unrewarded. Your lord&s;hip will do me honour in permitting me to cultivate a farther acquaintance with it. But, from the events of to-day, we may &s;ee how ineffectual are all attempts to &s;eparate tho&s;e whom love hath united, and heaven pre&s;erv'd for each other.</P>
