<HEAD>AN ESSAY At Removing National Prejudices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Part of this Work I attempted to prove the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Common National Pre|judices, which &s;eem to have taken too fa&s;t hold of the People of the&s;e Nations, and that &s;tand in the way of the Common Opinion about a Union.</P>
<P>There is nothing more Fatal to a General Union, than to have Peoples Minds prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Difficulties or Di&s;advantages of the thing it &s;elf; and I cannot there|fore think it improper to go on with this Work a little farther, to remove, if po&s;&s;ible, the very Root and Cau&s;es of the&s;e Prejudices, which I &s;ay Ob&s;truct the Happy Conjunction now in View&mdash;and the&s;e I take to be compri&s;ed in the two words ju&s;t mentioned above, <HI>viz. Difficulties</HI> and <HI>Di&s;advantages.</HI></P>
<P>When Men either think on one hand, 'tis &s;o difficult a Task, that they &s;hall never get thro' it; or on the other hand, that if they do get thro' it, it will not be their Advantage, no wonder if they go coldly about it, or &s;eem unconcern'd at the event.</P>
<P>I take the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who are to Treat of this Uni|on, perhaps in a different Manner or Capacity from what &s;ome People take them in; I do not take them as
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Gentlemen come together from two Nations at Variance, entring into a Confederation of Amity, and &s;o are &s;tru|gling and wrangling with one onother to get the be&s;t Terms they can, to each others advantage.</P>
<P>But I look upon the two Nations as intentionally Uni|ted into one Body, already fix'd, and re&s;olv'd to be from hence forward one People; and the Gentlemen come to|gether to &s;ettle &s;uch Articles of Mutual Friend&s;hip and Coallition, as may be mo&s;t effectually conducive to the Ea&s;e, Safety, Pro&s;perity and general Satisfaction of both, being now to be con&s;idered as one.</P>
<P>I look upon any thing Grievous, any thing particularly Burthen&s;om or Di&s;advantageous to either &s;ide, which may render the Union afterwards unea&s;ie or di&s;advantageous to one more than the other, ought to be the e&s;pecial Care of both Parties to prevent, that all Complaining and Di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction may be Anticipated.</P>
<P>Every thing that is e&s;pecially Di&s;advantageous to either &s;ide, is to be given up to the other; every thing particularly Burthen&s;ome to either &s;ide is to be removed for them, by the other, that the&s;e two Twin Nations may become one United <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Empire, re&s;olved into one Form of Govern|ment, one Intere&s;t, one Body Politick, under one Head, one Admini&s;tration, one Repre&s;entative, and &s;trengthned by one United Body of Power; a Power thereby &s;o En|creas'd, and in it &s;elf not only Impregnable, but Formi|dable to the whole World.</P>
<P>In forming this Union, either &s;ide chearfully brings her part, without Examining which contributes mo&s;t to the Work, or Repining at the &s;eeming inequalities; nor are tho&s;e Inequalities &s;o great, as &s;ome who are Enemies to this Union would &s;ugge&s;t; of which I &s;hall hereafter enlarge.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
Here is Wealth to Enrich, there is Strength to Defend; here Money to Pay, there Hands to Fight; here a Coun|try Improv'd, there a Country to Improve; here a Nation grown opulent by Trade, there a Nation, which let into Trade, will be in time as Rich and Opulent, and in Proportion, as much improv'd as they.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall their Increa&s;e be our Decrea&s;e, but ju&s;t the contrary; and I doubt not to make it appear, that not only <HI>England</HI> &s;hall gain by this Union, as a Nation United, but at a Nation Separate; That the Center of Trade, and the Center of Government being all here, all the Wealth that <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall accrue by Improvement, &s;hall Circulate thro' the Capital, and <HI>London</HI> &s;hall &s;till remain the Center of the Wealth of the whole I&s;land.</P>
<P>I &s;hall go on to prove, That the Improvement of <HI>Scot|land</HI> &s;hall every way be the Improvement of <HI>England,</HI> the Encrea&s;e of their Manufactures &s;hall no way interfere with ours, but almo&s;t infinite variety of Trade, in its Funds and Branches &s;hall encrea&s;e, to the general Wealth, and mutual inriching of each other.</P>
<P>In this Union here are Lands and People added to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Empire; the&s;e are the two E&s;&s;ential Parts of Strength, the&s;e for Improvement for Trade, for War, for every Publick National Advantage, are our own; the <HI>Scots</HI> being encourag'd to Indu&s;try, and enrich'd by Trade and Manufactures, &s;hall dwell at home, and encrea&s;e; the va&s;t Numbers that now fill the Armies, and &s;trag|gle about the Countries of our Neighbour-Princes, &s;hall then &s;tay at home, and living ea&s;y, &s;hall increa&s;e in Num|ber, and form the Wealth and Strength of <HI>Britain</HI> to a Magnitude too great to be mode&s;tly calculated.</P>
<P>The numbers that go abroad &s;hall People our Colonies, and extend our Borders on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> a Part of that World which this Nation has room in, to grow equally populous and terrible to what they are at home,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and who&s;e growing Wealth is all our own, and can never be thought too great.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hould have too many People, were 3 Millions of Strangers to come over hither, and &s;ettle; nay, tho' they brought nothing with them but their Hands, they would add to our National Wealth, as from the La|bour of tho&s;e People and their Expence for Nece&s;&s;aries, the General Stock would be encrea&s;ed, the Growth of our Land expended, and our Manufactures made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Heads of Increa&s;e, the Union of this Nati|on, or I&s;land, in time will be &s;uch an Encrea&s;e of Wealth and Strength, as can admit of no De&s;cription, and as the &s;eeming interfering Difficulties now talk'd of, bear no man|ner of Proportion to.</P>
<P>It is therefore certain the Gentlemen now treating of this happy Conjunction, if their Eyes &s;hall be &s;o far opened to the Publick Good, &s;hall &s;trive with one another to remove every Difficulty, to le&s;&s;en every Burthen, and to &s;tudy to make this Union at fir&s;t as agreeable, as it &s;hall at la&s;t be profitable to the whole Body.</P>
<P>In order to this, the De&s;ign of this &s;econd Tract is to level &s;ome of the Mountains that &s;tand in the middle be|tween this Union, and which &s;eem upon a remote view to be &s;o unpa&s;&s;able in their Situation, that they &s;hould inter|rupt our happy Meeting, repre&s;ent it as impractica|ble, or &s;eem by their &s;tupendous Heigth to hide from our Eyes, the real Advantages of the Propo&s;ed Conjun|ction.</P>
<P>Difficulties, like Dangers, often look greater at a remote than at a near View: di&s;tant Objects are &s;een by the help of Art, and often repre&s;ent them&s;elves in Figures diffe|rent from what they really are; as an I&s;land in the Sea at fir&s;t appears a rough heap of Craggy Rocks or Moun|tains, which threaten the Pilot with Shipwreck if he Ap|proaches; but when he comes nearer, he di&s;covers open
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Harbours, Navigable Rivers, a fruitful plea&s;ant Country, and a ho&s;pitable trading People, and then he is invited in to Exchange his Merchandizes and make a happy Voyage.</P>
<P>Let us therefore de&s;cend to a nearer View of Union; we have hitherto talk'd at a di&s;tance, and &s;trange Moun|tains of Difficulties have pre&s;ented them&s;elves; let us come clo&s;e up to the matter; let us view things as they are, and not as they &s;eem only; and let us &s;ee if perhaps the&s;e things may not upon a nearer View appear to be quite different from what we thought them to be.</P>
<P>If I under&s;tand what we are meaning, when we talk of Union, I under&s;tand it in the utmo&s;t Con&s;truction of that exten&s;ive Word&mdash;I under&s;tand an entire Coallition or Incorporation of two different Bodies into one, as compleatly every way, and to all Intents and Purpo&s;es as has been for|merly &s;ettled between the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and the Prin|cipalities of <HI>Wales;</HI> that we &s;hall for the future be one indi|vi&s;ible Community, conjoyned in every po&s;&s;ible Article and Circum&s;tance; &s;o as to have for the future but one Politick General Intere&s;t; be Brethren in Blood and Na|tion, Brethren in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Pro&s;pect and Power.</P>
<P>What Re&s;erves are made, are no more Ob&s;tructions to this healing Union, than the Men of <HI>Wales</HI> re&s;erving their Language, was an Ob&s;truction to their Coallition with <HI>En|gland.</HI> The Religion and Civil Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in <HI>Scotland,</HI> are no more concern'd in this Matter, than the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Religion and Methods of Ju&s;tice re&s;erv'd in <HI>Lanca|&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> have been Ob&s;tructions to their being an|nex'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, and made Provinces thereof.</P>
<P>The I&s;land will be One, the Government One, the Trea&s;ure One, the Military Power One; their general Commerce undivided and in Common, their Laws and Cu&s;toms re&s;erv'd to every part by the Regulations of their
<PB N="8" REF="7">
own Privileges, but under the Direction of one Legi&s;la|ture and Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>As to Religious Matters, the Ballance is exact, the Al|ternative harmonious, each E&s;tabli&s;hment pre&s;erv'd, gene|ral Charity maintain'd, the Church of <HI>England</HI> free and uninvaded in <HI>England,</HI> the Presbtyerian Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> free and unenvyed in <HI>Scotland;</HI> Epi&s;copacy here, Presby|tery there, and Toleration univer&s;al: Church of <HI>England</HI>-Men ruling here, and &s;ubmitting without Oppre&s;&s;ion there; Presbyterians ruling there, and &s;ubmitting here without Reproach or Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>They that are afraid indeed of &s;uch a Harmony, and who dare not unite, not their Principle only but their Cau&s;e &s;uffers &s;ome Scandal; &s;ince to me it mu&s;t pa&s;s for a Maxim, That Peace is &s;uch a heavenly Gift, that where it is incon&s;i&s;tent with any Party, People, Cau&s;e or Circum|&s;tance, that Foundation is founded upon &s;omething el&s;e than Heaven, and &s;avours of a Spirit wholly Infernal.</P>
<P>This is the pre&s;ent Union we are upon, nor can <HI>England</HI> agree to receive the <HI>Scot</HI> upon any other Foot; for any Uni|on that &s;hould leave a po&s;&s;ibility of a return to its fir&s;t Con|dition, would be Incongruous to the pre&s;ent De&s;ign, and di&s;advantageous to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>England</HI> expects by this Union, Safety, Peace and mu|tual A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Point of defending the Wealth She enjoys; <HI>Scotland</HI> expects Helps in Trade, A&s;|&s;i&s;tance to improve her Lands, employ her People, en|crea&s;e her Fi&s;hery, Shipping, and the like; one &s;eeks to gain, the other to keep what She has gain'd.</P>
<P>If <HI>Scotland</HI> by a partial Union &s;hall an&s;wer her End, grow Rich, Opulent and Formidable, and when She is &s;o, be empower'd to break with us, and go off; they are then Gainers by us, and we no Gainers by them; becau&s;e we are reduc'd by the Breach, to the &s;ame Circum&s;tance we were in before the Union; they have better'd them|&s;elves
<PB N="9" REF="8">
and cannot be &s;aid to be reduc'd, becau&s;e they will be then better able to &s;upport their Independency than they are now.</P>
<P>This to me &s;eems &s;o ju&s;t an Objection again&s;t what &s;ome call a federal Union, and the Scheme whereof they are very fond of, that I cannot but wonder to hear &s;uch a Pro|po&s;al &s;hould come from any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Man.</P>
<P>Till therefore they can remove the Inequality, which upon a Determination of &s;uch a Union, &s;hall lye hard on the &s;ide of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and prove the <HI>Scots</HI> can never break it to their Advantage and our Prejudice; I cannot think their Schemes worth examining, &s;ince to me they &s;eem cal|culated not to make a Union, but to break it off; and di&s;|appoint both Nations of the pre&s;ent good I&s;&s;ue, which they expect from this Treaty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore &s;uppo&s;e it out of Doubt, that there can no Union be Treated of between the Nations, but what &s;hall be an entire Incorporation of Principles: I mean a becoming one Body in all the publick Capacities of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>In Treating of the Methods to bring this to pa&s;s, I know no better way, than if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;tate the Circum&s;tances of both Nations, and bring them to a Balance; for cer|tainly while the Inequalities of things remain, there can be no fair Coalition, one Side or other would be Aggriev'd; that would be to jumble Circum&s;tances, huddle all things together, and by the cla&s;hing of Intere&s;ts, Inequa|lity of Particulars, and uncouth jarring of Cau&s;es and Con|&s;equences, would in&s;tead of uniting two Nations, put them into all manner of National Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>To bring a Union of cla&s;hing Intere&s;ts therefore to pa&s;s, I humbly conceive a Ballance of Circum&s;tances mu&s;t be the Ba&s;is to build upon, In which if I do not exactly pur|&s;ue, every Man, or perhaps any Man that has gone before me, <HI>I pray their Pardon,</HI> &s;ince 'tis effecting the Union, not
<PB N="10" REF="9">
imitating of any Man however &s;uperiour in Judgment, or Experience to me, that is the Mark to be aim'd at; and this I &s;hall pur&s;ue, with the &s;ame Sincerity that I wi&s;h it accompli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>To bring the Ballance of Circum&s;tances upon the Stage, it mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the &s;everal Inequalities in which the two Kingdoms now &s;tand, with re&s;pect to one another, and &s;ee if we can Even things as we go.</P>
<P>The principal Heads of Inequality I take to be Wealth, Trade, Religion, and Civil Power; I hope no Body will Cavil at my Order of ranking them, and putting Religion behind the Wealth and Trade, I &s;peak to it la&s;t, as that which I believe there will be lea&s;t Occa&s;ion for Di&s;pute a|bout; not but that if I had &s;aid, perhaps tho&s;e that Cavil mo&s;t at this Union, are not the mo&s;t concern'd for the religious Part of it, I might have &s;aid true enough.</P>
<P>In &s;tating the Wealth of the two Nations, we are to examine if po&s;&s;ible, the Proportions of either &s;ide, and with|out running into the &s;everal true Rea&s;ons of the Poverty of one Nation, and the Riches of the other, which tho' it is a Study would furni&s;h large Subjects of Speculation, yet as not exactly &s;uited to the pre&s;ent Enquiry, I wave with only this &s;hort Hint, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> has felt more the Weight of the Arbitrary De|&s;potick Tyranny of their Princes, which we all had &s;uch Rea&s;on to fear; the Neglect or Oppre&s;&s;ion of their Subjects, joyn'd to &s;ome unrea&s;onable Di&s;advantages of another &s;ort, and all added to an unhappy Con&s;titution, between the Gentry and the Commonalty, have form'd a Complica|tion of Circum&s;tances which have kept her declining in Wealth, for above a 100 Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> at the &s;ame time, has vi&s;ibly increas'd in Trade, Wealth, People, Colonies, and every thing that adds to the Opulence and Abundance of a Nation in a ri&s;ing Po|&s;ture before.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
So that without Vanity on one hand, or In&s;ulting on the other, there is a va&s;t di&s;parity of Circum&s;tances between the Kingdoms; and tho' in former E&s;timations, <HI>Scotland</HI> may have been valued with re&s;pect to <HI>England,</HI> as one to Seventeen, and &s;ome have drawn Schemes from that foot; I think there are &s;o many Rea&s;ons to be given for <HI>England</HI>'s ri&s;ing in Value, and <HI>Scotland</HI>'s &s;inking more than its Proportion, that it mu&s;t be owned no Judgment can be made from the&s;e former Calculations.</P>
<P>In Order therefore to form regular Calculations of the Wealth of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and at the &s;ame time go hand in hand with the Articles of a Union; I &s;hall begin with the Head of Taxes, which mu&s;t be mo&s;t concern'd in the&s;e Calcu|culations, and which I mu&s;t &s;ay, I believe to be the mo&s;t difficult point of the Treaty, at lea&s;t it has mo&s;t room for Debates on both hands.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen in <HI>England</HI> have made Calculations from the Taxes, in the old Parliament Union; when <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> having reduc'd <HI>Scotland</HI> by Arms, Incorporated them into one Body with this Nation; and by this Incor|poration they are Rated at 6000<HI>l. per</HI> Month in their Land Tax, when <HI>England</HI> was rated at 70000<HI>l. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>Tho' it al&s;o appears by the &s;ame Calculator, that <HI>Scot|land</HI> paid this 6000<HI>l. per</HI> Month, when <HI>England</HI> paid but 35000<HI>l. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>Now I would gladly apply this Calculation to our pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, before I enter upon Stating of our pre|&s;ent Proportions, that our grand Enquiry about an Equa|lity of Taxes, may be the plainer to enter upon.</P>
<P>Our Land Tax, in time of War, at 4<HI>s. per l.</HI> is &s;uppos'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Millions Sterling.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> paying 6000 to our 35000 <HI>per</HI> Month, which is &s;omething le&s;s than a &s;ixth part, not to trouble the Read|er with Fractions, by the &s;ame Rule in two Millions <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y">
<HI>Annum,</HI> which our Land Tax rai&s;es, they mu&s;t be charge|able with 333333. 6. 8. <HI>per Annnm,</HI> Land Tax.</P>
<P>If you return from this Arbitrary difference which <HI>Oli|ver Cromwel</HI> and his Parliament made; which, as is ob|&s;erv'd, was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in con&s;ideration that <HI>England</HI> had for divers Years pa&s;t, been at almo&s;t all the Expence of War;</Q> Still, at the former Calculation, <HI>Scotland</HI> would in a four Shilling Aid, pay half that Sum, <HI>viz.</HI> 166666. 13. 4. <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Now to examine the Rents of each Kingdom, what mu&s;t this Amount to, the Annual Rents of Lands in <HI>Scotland,</HI> mu&s;t by the fir&s;t Calculation, amount to One Million, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Thou&s;and, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Pound, Thirteen and Four Pence Sterling, <HI>per Annum,</HI> and by the la&s;t Calculation ju&s;t half the Money.</P>
<P>Both which Sums are far wide of the Fact, and far be|yond what <HI>Scotland</HI> is able to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>But this is by the way.</P>
<P>I am now come to the Grand Que&s;tion, Whe|ther in Ca&s;e of a Union, and an Equality between the Kingdoms, there ought not to be an Equality of Burthens; and without any He&s;itations, I agree readily, it mu&s;t cer|tainly be &s;o.</P>
<P>But then it remains to make &s;ome needful Enquiry into what we mean by Equality.</P>
<P>All Equalities mu&s;t be Subjected to Proportion, or el&s;e Confu&s;ion would &s;pread over every &s;tep we take. I need not enter, I pre&s;ume, into the Particulars, or form a Philo&s;ophical Sy&s;tem of Equality; if an Army Marches charg'd with their own Baggage, if every Man carries a Burthen proportioned to his &s;trength, tho' the &s;trong Man has a heavy load, and the weak Man a light, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, the di&s;tribution is equal.</P>
<P>Wherefore 'tis plain, and all our Calculators allow, a Nu|merical or Arithmetical Equality cannot be meant here&mdash;It mu&s;t then be a Geometrical, or proportioned Equality.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
How then, &s;ay &s;ome, Shall we come to a true &s;tate of Proportion? I an&s;wer, This is the Hare we are Hunting, and tho' I may be at a fault now and then, I per&s;wade my &s;elf I &s;hall make it out at la&s;t, and fairly run her down in view.</P>
<P>I begin with the Land Tax&mdash;and here I meet with an Objection, which I do not find any body has &s;tarted yet.</P>
<P>You talk of Proportious and Equalities, Pray why &s;hou'd not the <HI>Scots</HI> pay equal to us in their Land Tax, &s;ince all is paid upon a Net Rent, the Poverty of the Country is not concern'd in it, 20<HI>s.</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> is as good as 20<HI>s.</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and better too, becau&s;e Money is dearer there, and living is much cheaper, he that has 100<HI>l.</HI> Sterling in <HI>Scotland,</HI> can much better pay 4<HI>s.</HI> in the Pound out of it, than he that has 100<HI>l.</HI> a Year in <HI>England;</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI> is no more in one Place than another, &s;ince no body pays it but he that has the Fund in Rent to pay it from.</P>
<P>This Objection is weighty, and has more in it than any I have yet met with, and therefore I think requires &s;ome An&s;wer.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Rea&s;ons, and I think very good ones; why the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould not be Tax'd at 4<HI>s. per l.</HI> upon their Rents, when we are &s;o Tax'd, and I &s;hall fir&s;t offer them in General, before I come to enquire what Proportions are rea&s;onable in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I am not at all Pleading here for the <HI>Scots</HI> ab&s;tracted, or for an abatement of Taxes to them. I allow 20<HI>s.</HI> is 20<HI>s.</HI> there or here, and ought to bear an equal Burthen in the whole, but I am arguing for Ju&s;tice and Equality; if we will not prepare our &s;elves to bear with the Proportions that the&s;e things allow, we &s;hall not do Ju&s;tice; and if we will not do Ju&s;tice, we can never come to a Union.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="13">
I. A Numerical Equality can not be Ju&s;t in the Land Tax to the <HI>Scots,</HI> becau&s;e really &s;peaking, our Land Tax it &s;elf is not equally a&s;&s;e&s;s'd, it bears no Conformity to its Ti|tle, and would, if literally Executed, be the greate&s;t Piece of Inju&s;tice and Inequality in the World to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and perfectly ruine that Nation.</P>
<P>'Tis known to all that under&s;tand the&s;e things, that the <HI>Scots</HI> way of Collecting their Taxes, is rigorous and exact, and if 4<HI>s. per l.</HI> was laid by Parliament upon the whole I&s;land, their A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments would <HI>bona fide</HI> be 4<HI>s. per l.</HI> upon the Rack Rent of all their Lands.</P>
<P>'Tis as well known, that 4<HI>s. per l.</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> is a Lion's Face upon an A&s;se's Head, and the Ears are &s;o plain to be &s;een, that it &s;erves now for a meer <HI>Priapus,</HI> a Scarecrow without any Effect, for it never puts the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors out of their old road, but they A&s;&s;e&s;s according to the old Rates, and every County being Rated in the very body of the Act, the Title is <HI>Ip&s;o Facto</HI> repeal'd, &s;ince if the Lands, &amp;c. of that Country will rai&s;e the Money by an A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI> Pound, and 'tis known &s;ome do for le&s;s, the Law is &s;atisfied, and the End an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Now to Tax <HI>Scotland</HI> at 4<HI>s. per l.</HI> upon her Net Rent, and Tax our own Northern and We&s;tern Counties, but at &s;o much Money, which they can rai&s;e by a Proportion of 16<HI>d.</HI> to 20<HI>d.</HI> at mo&s;t <HI>per l.</HI> would be &s;uch a piece of In|ju&s;tice, as I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd for my Native Country to &s;ee them in&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that you mu&s;t Tax <HI>Scotland</HI> not by your Pound Rate, but at a Proportioned Summ, as your own Countries are Tax'd, and leave them to the Divi&s;ion of it, to rai&s;e it as they &s;ee fit, and this I call a Geometrical Equality, and this I &s;hall &s;ay more to, when that Propor|tioned Summ comes to be &s;poken of.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="14">
II. The Sum charg'd upon Lands in <HI>England</HI> after it is le|vied and rai&s;ed from the Tenant, &s;tands charg'd with large Deductions and Charges, upon the Levying, Collecting, and Receiving; and tho&s;e Charges, if my Calculations are right, amount to little le&s;s than 9<HI>d per l.</HI> upon the Money receiv'd, be&s;ides publick Lo&s;&s;es by the In&s;olvency of Re|ceivers and their Securities, which oftentimes runs deep into the Money; and which tho' they cannot be brought into an exact Account yet I think put all together, 12<HI>d. per</HI> Pound may at lea&s;t very well be Charg'd upon the whole, as an Off Reckoning or Di&s;count upon the Money, between the Collection and the Exchequer.</P>

<P N="3">III. Differing Cu&s;toms and Manners of paying Rent and letting out Lands in the two Kingdoms, make a Nume|rical Equallity Impracticable.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> the Rents are paid in Mony, in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are, generally &s;peaking, paid in Kind, or Vittle as they call it: Now tho' 'tis true this may, and is in &s;ome re&s;pect brought to a Head by a General Valuation, yet with this Difference, again&s;t a <HI>Scots</HI> Landlord to an <HI>Engli&s;h, viz.</HI> that the <HI>Scots</HI> Landlord &s;tays two Terms, and runs two Ri&s;ques in his receiving the Rent of his Land.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he &s;tays the Term agreed to receive of his Tenant, and &s;econdly he tru&s;ts the Merchant a &s;econd Term, to
<PB N="16" REF="15">
whom he &s;ells the Produce he receives of his Tenant; in the &s;ame Sen&s;e he runs two Hazards; one in the Solvency of the Tenant, and the other of the Merchant; which makes a con&s;iderable Difference in the e&s;&s;ential va|lue of the Rent, and con&s;equently of the Purcha&s;e of &s;uch an E&s;tate; and tho' the Purcha&s;e or Real Value of Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> may not come into this Di&s;pute; yet I mu&s;t tell my Reader, that were an E&s;tate let in <HI>England</HI> to pay the Rent in kind, it would &s;ell for much le&s;s than an E&s;tate of the &s;ame Value paid in Specie: nor would it be Tax'd at near &s;o much in our Common A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; which I refer to any indifferent judge to determine.</P>
<P>The Matter of Purcha&s;e will not argue between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e were there the &s;ame Security of Title to Land in <HI>England,</HI> as there now is in <HI>Scotland;</HI> I am of opi|nion it would advance the Price of Land in <HI>England,</HI> above Ten years Purcha&s;e; why we are not wi&s;e enough to do it, I &s;hall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P N="4">4. The la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall give, not but that there are yet more, is the difference in letting our Lands in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which are in many Places fin'd down, and the &s;ta|ted Rents reduc'd: whereas in <HI>Scotland</HI> Lands are let without Lea&s;es, or but on &s;hort Terms, and at a Rack-Rent; any Man that knows what belongs to Letting or Taking Lands in <HI>England</HI> cannot be ignorant&mdash;1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That the Landlord, letting a long Lea&s;e to the Tenant, confining him to &s;uch and &s;uch Improvement, makes frequent Con&s;i|derations in the Rent; and the Rea&s;on is plain, that the E&s;tate advances upon it at the Expiration of the Term. 2. Any Tenant that takes a Farm without a certainty of years, will give the more, becau&s;e he really &s;eeks the ut|mo&s;t Produce of the Land, without any regard to the time beyond him; and tho' the needy Landlord (for none but &s;uch will let their Land &s;o) puts &s;omething the more Money in his Pocket for the pre&s;ent; yet his E&s;tate &s;inks,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
&s;inks, the Land is beggar'd, grows poor and out of heart, and he lo&s;es in the end.</P>
<P>This is a large Field, and perhaps would di&s;cover to the <HI>Scots</HI> much of the Rea&s;on why their Country is &s;o poor, and con&s;equently how to recover it, and make it rich; &s;ince the va&s;t difference between the value of their Lands and ours cannot be wholly in the Land it &s;elf, but in the Management of the Tenantry, and Defect of their Lea&s;es and Contracts; but this is not the pre&s;ent Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, I &s;hall handle that by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;hould this Article of 4<HI>s per l.</HI> be in|&s;i&s;ted on in the literal Sence, and the <HI>Scots</HI> come to con&s;ider how to avoid it, by Fining down Rents and other advan|tageous Methods, which they may ea&s;ily find out, they might &s;oon evade the Act, and pay little or nothing; and this would be an Evil hard to di&s;cover; and if found out, al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to cure.</P>
<P>For Example, If a Tenant takes a Farm in <HI>England</HI> at 100<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> which in reality is worth 150; if he is bound to Build or Fence, if he is under Contract to Im|prove, Drein or Cure; if he contracts to give his Landlord &s;o many Quarters of Mault or Wheat, or Oats, or the like; he &s;wears to the Annual Rent, produces his Lea&s;e, and &s;hall be Tax'd no more than he pays in Money; this would leave Room for &s;trange Advantages in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in your 4<HI>s.</HI> Aid, the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hall &s;oon come off for 6<HI>d.</HI> in the Pound.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e Rea&s;ons are &s;ufficient to prove, that a Nu|merical or Arithmetical Proportion of Taxes, cannot be in&s;i&s;ted on with the <HI>Scots,</HI> as being unrea&s;onable on their &s;ide, and unable to an&s;wer the End on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>From this I come to examine if po&s;&s;ible, what may be counted a due Equality; and here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter a little into the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of Taxes in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;ince the Re&s;toration; which bringing it down to the pre|&s;ent Time, may &s;erve as a Rule to this Matter.</P>
<P>Anciently the levying Money upon Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was call'd in General <HI>the Taxation;</HI> and the manner of le|vying it was by Rules altogether ob&s;olete and now grown out of U&s;e, as the Cu&s;tom of Tenths, Fifteenths, Sub&s;i|dies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The now Method of Taxing Land has its beginning, as to Practice, in the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of 6000<HI>l. per</HI> Month, &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland</HI> in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s time, when a Union was actually form'd and &s;ettled; of which, however deficient in it &s;elf, without doubt this may be &s;aid, that it had in it the E&s;&s;ential Parts, and might be modell'd into a compleat Coalition.</P>
<P>This is the Tax they now go by, and is call'd in <HI>Scot|land</HI> THE CESS, by which I under&s;tand <HI>a Month's A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment;</HI> 'tis rai&s;ed upon Land by a Method peculiarly exact, and I have never heard any one complain of the Inequality.</P>
<P>'Tis rai&s;ed, as is before noted, without any Charge, De|duction, or Defalcation, and is paid <HI>Nett</HI> into the Trea|&s;ury.</P>
<P>According as the Occa&s;ions of the Government require, this Tax is encrea&s;ed; but then not the Sum <HI>per</HI> Month is encrea&s;ed, but the number of Months are encrea&s;ed, which by the help of time encrea&s;es the Sum.</P>
<P>The Original of the Demand was as before, and of the Method, but the Continuance of it was thus introduced;</P>
<P>Anciently the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> contented them&s;elves with the ancient Deme&s;nes, Crown-Lands, Cu&s;toms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and on extraordinary Ca&s;es <HI>the Taxation</HI> as above, Exci&s;es or any &s;ort were altogether unknown, till the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second in the Year 1661, obtain'd of the <HI>Scots</HI> to give him a &s;ettled Sum of 40000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling during his Life, in Con&s;ideration whereof, he promi&s;ed never to demand any Ce&s;s or <HI>Taxation,</HI> except in Time of War, as by the Words of the Act as follows.&mdash;<Q><PB N="19" REF="18">

<P>From this time to the Year 1678, <HI>Scotland</HI> had no more Ce&s;s or Convention, nor was at any Charge more than to make good the Deficiency of the 40000<HI>l.</HI> mentioned be|fore; except 3 Months Ce&s;s during the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, expiring at <HI>Candlemas,</HI> 1674.</P>

<P>'T would be remote to this matter to enter into the &s;e|cret Hi&s;tory of the&s;e arbitrary Proceedings in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which I could give &s;uch a Di&s;play of Tyranny, that who|ever were to read &s;ome Stories of it, which I could furni&s;h the World with, would no more wonder, why the <HI>Scots</HI> are &s;o mov'd again&s;t a Race of Men, that pretend to be hardly treated there.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Court Parties &s;truggled, who &s;hould give their Country away fa&s;te&s;t, the Bi&s;hops got into every part of the Civil Juri&s;diction; the Severities again&s;t the People fir&s;t drove them into De&s;perations and Rebellions, and then &s;uch Advantages were taken, and &s;uch u&s;e made
<PB N="22" REF="21">
of the &s;aid In&s;urrections to ruine others, that the poor Peo|ple were brought to the Brink of general Ruin: the Na|tion brought to that pa&s;s, that a Man might be fin'd or <HI>forfaulted;</HI> that is, his E&s;tate taken from him, for his Wives giving a Half-penny at his Door to a common Beg|gar, on pretence it was relieving a Rebel.</P>
<P>Thus poor <HI>Scotland</HI> was bought and &s;old, and the Ex|ample is u&s;eful for our Ob&s;ervation a great many ways; for thus &s;hall every Nation be u&s;ed, that is divided into con|tending Parties, and expos'd to an encroaching Govern|ment.</P>
<P>But that I may not have &s;aid all this foreign to the pre|&s;ent Purpo&s;e, it is very ob&s;ervable, that this will make one PERIOD for Taxation, <HI>viz.</HI> the highe&s;t that an arbitrary Prince back'd with a Mercenary Nobility, and a govern|ing Clergy, even in the greate&s;t Extream of ab&s;olute Ty|ranny, ever impos'd upon this Nation, which they de&s;ir'd to &s;qeeze, and car'd not if they ruin'd.</P>
<P>Come we now to the Revolution, which the&s;e Exorbi|tances had no little Influence upon; the fir&s;t thing Tran&s;|acted upon the Meeting of the E&s;tates or Convention of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was to break the&s;e Chains; re-a&s;&s;ume the Power of rai&s;ing Taxes by Parliament, and make them&s;elves Judges both of the Occa&s;ion, and of the Sum.</P>
<P>However as in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince the Revolution, greater Oc|ca&s;ions have call'd for immen&s;e Sums to carry on the War; and &s;uch Taxes have been rais'd as were never heard of before; &s;o in <HI>Scotland</HI> the Parliament have agreed to &s;uch Taxes, as, the afore&s;aid Time of Tyranny excepted, were never known in <HI>Scotland</HI> before.</P>
<P>Yet in the carrying on this War, &s;ix or &s;even Months Ce&s;s has one time with another, been thought <HI>Scotland</HI>'s full Proportion, and the late KING excepting one or two Years on extraordinary Occa&s;ions, always contented him&s;elf with it, and this at the &s;ame time that <HI>England</HI> rais'd 4<HI>s.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<HI>per l.</HI> upon their Land, and Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty has never demanded more of her Subjects there, tho' the Weight of the War is now as great as ever, and this I call another PERIOD of Taxation.</P>
<P>Now, what I mean by a Geometrical Scale, or Equality in Taxes, is drawn from the&s;e Proportions.</P>
<P>That &s;ince exact Valuation of Rents cannot be made on both &s;ides, and lea&s;t of all in <HI>England;</HI> it &s;eems as good a way to come at this Equality, as any I have yet &s;een.</P>
<P>That the highe&s;t Period of Taxes that ever <HI>Scotland</HI> bore &s;ince the Re&s;toration, may be taken on one hand, and &s;et again&s;t the highe&s;t Period of Taxes that ever <HI>En|gland</HI> bore, I mean of a Land-Tax on both &s;ides; and let this &s;tand together as the Scale of Equality.</P>
<P>Thus &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> 8 Months Ce&s;s, tho' that was the heighth of Tyrannick Impo&s;ition, and tho' 'tis allowed the <HI>Scots</HI> are manife&s;tly impoveri&s;h'd, and le&s;s able to bear it than they were; yet &s;ay, it be full 8 Months Ce&s;s, and &s;et this again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> 4<HI>s per l.</HI> and I cannot believe any more ju&s;t Calculation can be made.</P>
<P>Thus when ever a Tax upon Land for 4<HI>s per</HI> Pound is granted, the <HI>Scots</HI> pay 8 Months Ce&s;s if of 2<HI>s per</HI> Pound in <HI>England,</HI> 4 Months Ce&s;s; and &s;o in Proportion.</P>
<P>Nor is this &s;o wide of more nice Calculators, the Inge|nious Author <HI>Of the Enquiry into the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Con&s;equences of a &V;nion,</HI> &amp;c. Calculates <HI>Scotland</HI> to pay 50000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> on Land, when <HI>England</HI> pays 2 Mil|lions, in which he differs but 2000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI></P>
<P>What better and more regular Equation can be drawn than this, I confe&s;s I know not; and tho' the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;eem in this to &s;ave no Money by the Revolution, but to return to the Valuation put on them by their wor&s;t Enemies, yet I hope they will think the Union not bought too dear, what|ever they pay in Rea&s;on, and within their Ability for it; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the Continuance of the extraordinary

Taxes, are only for the pre&s;ent State of War, which we hope cannot la&s;t long.</P>
<P>I come next to the Taxes on Trade, and the&s;e con&s;i&s;t in Cu&s;toms upon Goods Imported from abroad, and Exci&s;e on the Con&s;umption at home; and here are yet greater In|equalit&s;es than before, and they are to be con&s;idered by Proportion al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Inequalities here will lye on both &s;ides; and fir&s;t on the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;hould not the Scale come up even to a Literal Numerical Equality in point of Goods Imported, an open free uninterrupted Commerce by Land being the Con&s;e|quence of a Union, they would ruine the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, by &s;upplying our Markets with all &s;orts of Imported Goods, cheaper than our Merchants could do; and this would be a mo&s;t de&s;tructive Article in Trade, e&s;pecially in fine Goods. For Example, in Linens from <HI>Hamborough</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or in Tobacco, Coffee, Tea, Chacolate, &s;uch other things as are now under large Duty and &s;mall Carriage; the&s;e would all be &s;pread over <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Scots,</HI> to our Damage, and a Confu&s;ion in Trade.</P>
<P>There is no Doubt therefore but the Cu&s;toms, Prohibiti|ons, and Charges of all foreign Importations, mu&s;t be nu|merically and literally the &s;ame in both Nations, unle&s;s a &s;mall Abatement, which it may be nece&s;&s;ary to allow to the <HI>Scots</HI> for Encouragement of Shipping, and for the Car|riage of their Overplus to <HI>London,</HI> which &s;till will be the Commanding Port in Trade.</P>
<P>But I come from the&s;e Heads, to the general State of Taxes in both Nations; and here the Scale of Inequality is very uneven, and the <HI>Scots</HI> have va&s;tly the Di&s;advan|tage, in Ca&s;e of a Union.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are a rich Nation but greatly in Debt, the <HI>Scots</HI> are poor but free and clear from all manner of Incumbrance, Arrear, or any Claim of Debt what&s;o|ever.</P>

<P>The Credits of the old Trade are &s;et apart, and the Debts of the old Trade are &s;et again&s;t them, and they are paid off, and receiv'd in, by them&s;elves, for the &s;eparate Accounts of the old Trader; and all future Dealings go on upon a new Foot.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome Gentlemen differ from my Opinion in this Matter, but I de&s;ire to explain my &s;elf, and then &s;ubmit my Judgment to any Man's Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>We have a Debt upon us Contracted by the Length and Weight of the War, which will not be paid in many Years; the <HI>Scots</HI> have no Debt upon them, they bring a &s;mall but clear Revenue, the Overplus of which will revert into our Exchequer.</P>
<P>Speaking upon the Square, there is no Rea&s;on we &s;hould ask the <HI>Scots</HI> to help pay our Debts, or to come into our appropri|ated Taxes, and here as I conceive lyes the greate&s;t Difficulty of the Treaty.</P>
<P>An Equality of Taxation, under&s;tood as before, is certainly mo&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Trade, to compleat the Union and to remove Di&s;advantages in Commerce. But <HI>England</HI> to an|&s;wer her va&s;t Debts has loaded her &s;elf with &s;ome Taxes which are in their Circum&s;tances impracticable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which would if offered tend to di&s;compo&s;e the People there, and render the Union odious and unea&s;ie to them, as a thing that would load them with Taxes, which they never heard of, and which their pre&s;ent Condition will not &s;uffer them to bear.</P>
<P>To reconcile this Difficulty, the Author before quoted, has I think, a little too ea&s;ily come into the Thing, for an Equivalent to be paid out of the &s;aid Duties in &s;everal Sums, which he places again&s;t their &s;hare of the Debt as follows:</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts amount to a heavy Sum, no le&s;s, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> than one and twenty Millions, and the Gentleman &s;tates by a rea&s;ona|ble Proportion enough, the <HI>Scot</HI>'s &s;hare of tho&s;e Debts &s;hall be
<PB N="26" REF="25">
600000<HI>l.</HI> in return for this, he offers a Rent-Charge of 30000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to be appropriated to certain u&s;es for the publick Good, till this Sum of 600000<HI>l.</HI> &s;hall be paid.</P>
<P>This is the Equivalent for bringing the <HI>Scots</HI> in, to pay their <HI>Quota</HI> of 21 Millions of our Debts.</P>
<P>But to examine this, let us fir&s;t enquire what occa&s;ion have the <HI>Scots</HI> to make us this Loan, or what Nece&s;&s;ity are we in to ask it. For in &s;hort, this is nothing but borrowing, 600000<HI>l.</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> to pay our Debts, and repaying them again by a Rent-Charge of 30000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> out of their own Money, and this without any Partiality to the <HI>Scots,</HI> I mu&s;t own a mo&s;t un|rea&s;onable Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>'Tis allow'd by the Gentleman afore&s;aid, that after the Uni|on, the Over-plus of the Revenue in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Civil Government being entirely defrayed, amounts to 186000<HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Now who &s;hall this Overplus revert to? the An&s;wer is &s;hort and plain, it &s;hall revert to the united Trea&s;ury of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of that is, that we &s;hall gain all That Sum in ready Money yearly from the <HI>Scots,</HI> an Article I humbly recommend to tho&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;ay, <HI>We &s;hall get no|thing by the &V;nion.</HI></P>
<P>Now if this be true, I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on, nor the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion, why we &s;hould oblige the <HI>Scots</HI> to come into every Tax we have laid, whether it be properly &s;uited for their Country or no; and this leads me to examine:</P>
<P N="2">II. What Condition are the <HI>Scots</HI> in, to come up to you in an Equality of Taxes? There may be &s;ome Taxes which are peculiarly proper or improper for one Country, which are not &s;o in another; the Taxes in <HI>England</HI> chiefly lye on foreign Trade, in <HI>Holland</HI> they lye on the Home-Con&s;umption; &s;hould <HI>England</HI> pay for every Diminutive of their Eatables and Drink|ables as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do, our Yeomandry and Common People would be undone. Should <HI>Holland</HI> load their Trade, and lay heavy Duties on their Imports, they had hardly been a People, much le&s;s a Rich Opulent Nation; and many Rea&s;ons might on both &s;ides be given to prove this Ob&s;ervation, but I bring it nearer home.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
There are a great many Rea&s;ons to be given, why the <HI>Scots</HI> are no way able to bear the pre&s;ent Duties upon Malt and Salt, which are rai&s;ed in <HI>England;</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;peak pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>But giving me leave to beg the Que&s;tion for the pre&s;ent, do but &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Duties improper for <HI>Scotland,</HI> let us inquire next, why &s;hould they be impo&s;ed?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, they are both Calculated but at 40000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> which deducted from the Sum of 186000<HI>l.</HI> you &s;till receive 146000 <HI>per Ann.</HI> out of <HI>Scotland</HI> clear of all Expence, as a Ca|pital, clearly gain'd by the Union.</P>
<P>If it be true that the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hall grow rich by you, their Ri|ches &s;hall &s;till be your Gain; as their Trade encrea&s;es &s;o will their Cu&s;toms; and all &s;hall tend to rai&s;e that Sum of 146000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> higher, and more to the publick Gain of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>So that, Gentlemen, do but pay your own Debts, and you have no need to lay any unrea&s;onable Burthen upon your Neighbours.</P>
<P>But now to &s;how how this is &s;till more Equal, let us exa|mine the Great Que&s;tion here, How mu&s;t we carry on the War? If I were a <HI>Scot</HI> I would an&s;wer it by asking another: How do you carry it on now?&mdash;We are to pay none of your Debts for you now, why &s;hould we buy our Union with you at 600000<HI>l.</HI> Debt, and 186000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> Taxes?</P>
<P>On the other hand, take away your appropriated Taxes, and your War would be carried on without the Taxes on Malt and Salt; were your Debts all paid, 'tis certain the Land-Tax, Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;e, and &s;ettled Branches of Revenue, as Coals, Stampt-Paper, Po&s;t-Office. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would carry on the whole Ex|pence of the War.</P>
<P>So that 'tis very evident, take the Rea&s;on of the Ca&s;e into Con&s;ideration, there can be nothing &s;aid why the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould come into a literal Equality of Taxes, the Taxes them&s;elves being incon&s;i&s;tent with their Circum&s;tances, and only nece&s;&s;ary to you here for Payment of Debts, not for carrying on the War.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
It remains to examine why the&s;e two Taxes are un&s;uitable to, or impracticable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e they are Exorbitant in their Rate, being Charg'd not upon the Value, but upon the Bulk of the Commodity; and the Goods bearing &s;o different a Value in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>England,</HI> to put the Duty equal, would be Tax to the <HI>Scots</HI> in three times the Sum they are tax'd at in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For Example, &s;uppo&s;e the Duty upon Salt, which is charg'd by Weight in general, amounts in <HI>Scotland</HI> to 16<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> Sterling, upon 3<HI>s</HI> value, and in <HI>England</HI> to 16<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> Sterling, upon 10<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d</HI> Value, or thereabout; let any Man &s;tate the Proportion, here they will ea&s;ily allow the Tax to be intolerable to the <HI>Scots;</HI> &s;ince by the &s;ame Proportion the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ought to pay 2<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> for the &s;ame quantity of Salt, or the <HI>Scots</HI> ought to pay but 4<HI>s</HI> 8<HI>d,</HI> for that which by this Tax is rated at 16<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> and the like, tho' not in &s;o great a Difference, for the Malt.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Weight of the Salt Tax lyes e&s;pecially on the Poor, who in <HI>Scotland</HI> live very much on Salt Meats, and who&s;e dif|fering Condition from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> does not permit, nor cannot bear being tax'd at all, much le&s;s equal to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And not to in&s;i&s;t on the further Impracticablene&s;s of the&s;e Taxes, I &s;hall an&s;wer one Objection here.</P>
<P>If we are tax'd on our Salt and Malt, and <HI>Scotland</HI> is not, then all the Salt and Malt that can be convey'd from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> will make an unrea&s;onable Advantage to one, and be injurious to the other,</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer,&mdash;The &s;ame Argument is good again&s;t reduction of the Rate to an Equality, and yet the contrary would be an intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ion, and an Inequality too extravagant to mention. The Remedy for this is thus.</P>
<P>They are both bulky Commodities and not to be hid, the Exci&s;e-Men in the Towns on the Borders, and the Officers on the Coa&s;t, may be empowered to Charge all Malt and Salt Imported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duty as they would do now; and this may be without any Addition of Officers, either on the Borders or in the Ports; the Salt being &s;o bulky and heavy, that it can't be conceal'd, put in a Pocket, or car|ried under a Coat; &s;o I think that Difficulty falls to the Ground,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
and to reconcile the re&s;t, the following General, which is the Con&s;equence of the whole, &s;eems to me highly rea&s;onable on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>That what Debts are contracted on both &s;ides, be paid by both Nations, out of the re&s;pective Duties of either Nation, as now e&s;tabli&s;h'd. That the Overplus of the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenue be improv'd for the Settling Trade, and Encouragement and Employment of the Poor, and other publick U&s;es; That the <HI>Scots</HI> be exempted from the Taxes of Salt, and Malt, only for &s;o long as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts are paid, or for a Certain Term of Years, to be Calculated from the Proportion between tho&s;e Taxes and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts&mdash;And afterwards to &s;tand upon a proportion'd Equality with <HI>England,</HI> in all Taxes that &s;hall be rais'd for the Publick Good.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be call'd an Equality, becau&s;e <HI>Scotland</HI> is at pre|&s;ent unconcern'd in our Debts, and cannot rea&s;onably be brought into an Encumbrance for that Money they had no hand in borrowing, nor any part of the Advantage of.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, they &s;hall have an Equivalent for this Payment, is not an An&s;wer; becau&s;e I think it may be &s;aid, the Tax cannot be laid, the poor cannot pay it; the Equivalent is to the State, and cannot be given the Poor that are aggriev'd; if it can, 'tis the &s;ame thing, and not Taxing is a nearer way to keep them ea&s;ie.</P>
<P>As to the Exci&s;es of Beer, Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;ee no occa&s;ion to debate them; 'Tis a Charge on none but the Liquor &s;old, and affects no Body, but they that plea&s;e to &s;pend their Money; Only it requires the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale, which they call <HI>Two-peny Ale,</HI> and which is about the Price of our Small Beer, &s;hould be expre&s;s'd to &s;ignifie Small Beer, and to pay as &s;uch, the Value being the &s;ame. Otherwi&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> would pay for the Name; and calling that Ale, which really is but Small Beer, be wrong'd in the Proportion, and be pinch'd in their Trade.</P>
<P>Nor is all this to be call'd advocating for the <HI>Scots;</HI> the Que|&s;tion is not here, whether it be pleading on this Side or that, but whether the Facts on either &s;ide be true? And whether the calculated Proportions are &s;tated right, and the Rea&s;ons good? If not, I &s;hould be pleas'd to &s;ee any Gentleman fairly detect them, and would be very forward to alter my Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
To argue then for Truth and Ju&s;tice, impartially to &s;tate the Inequalities on either &s;ide, and bring them to a Balance, is neither Arguing for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nor the <HI>Scots,</HI> but for the Union in general, and in that re&s;pect is for the general Good of <HI>Britain;</HI> &s;ince the Union is for the Advantage of the whole, but more e&s;pecially for <HI>England;</HI> which, in the Pur&s;uit of this Work, I que&s;tion not to make good.</P>
<P>It remains now to enquire&mdash;That &s;ince the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenue &s;hall amount to above 140000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> more than their Expence, whether it &s;hall not be thought rea&s;onable to employ that Money, or &s;uch part of it, as &s;hall be thought &s;ufficient for the publick Improvement of the Countrey, from whence it is rai&s;ed; and How</P>
<P>The Methods for Employing it, the ju&s;t Occa&s;ion there is to do &s;o, for Re&s;toring the Trade of that Kingdom, Em|ploying the Poor, Reviving Manufactures, and making Good Lo&s;&s;es, will be the Subject of the next Part of this Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Some Expedients, and their proper Explications, for Setling the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> to the Mutual Advantage, and, I hope, Satisfaction of both Kingdoms, &s;hall al&s;o be part of our Care.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, To examine the Inequalities between the Two Kingdoms with relation to Trade, reduce them to a Balance, and make &s;ome Enquiry into tho&s;e hard Articles to us, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The letting the <HI>Scots</HI> into Our Plantation-Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Opening to them the Fountain of our Manufactures; I mean our Wool, by which we &s;ay, they fall into Our Trade, and by Under-working, and by Con&s;equence Under &s;elling, ruine Our Trade at home, and rob us of the mo&s;t Capital Article of Our Pro&s;perity, the Employment of our Poor.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I cannot enter upon the&s;e things here; but I cannot conclude this Part of the Work, without &s;aying, I doubt not to prove, That even in all the&s;e things we &s;hall have the Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and be Gainers by the Union.</P>
<P>I &s;hall prove, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Trading to our Colonies, &s;hall enrich tho&s;e very Colonies, and that in the &s;ingle and only Wealth, which at pre&s;ent is the Dead Weight upon their Pro|&s;perity, <HI>viz.</HI> the want of People&mdash;What prevents our <HI>Nor|way</HI>
