<HEAD>ON THE PROVINCE OF COMEDY.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS are the methods which art and ingenuity have invented to exhibit a picture of human life and manners. The&s;e have dif|fered from each other both in the mode of repre&s;enta|tion, and in the particular view of the &s;ubject which has been taken. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, it is univer|&s;ally allowed that the dramatic form is by far the mo&s;t perfect. The circum&s;tance of leaving every character to di&s;play it&s;elf in its own proper language, with all the variations of tone and ge&s;ture which di&s;tingui&s;h it from others, and which mark every emotion of the mind; and the &s;cenic delu&s;ions of dre&s;s, painting, and machinery, contribute to &s;tamp &s;uch an appearance of reality upon dramatic repre&s;entations as no other of the imitative arts can attain. Indeed, when in their per|fection, they can &s;carcely be called imitations, but the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Tragedy, and &s;erious parts into that called a Comedy, yet it has ever been under&s;tood that what con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ential and invariable character of each is &s;ome|thing which is expre&s;&s;ed by the terms <HI>tragic</HI> and <HI>comic,</HI> and comes under the head of <HI>&s;erious</HI> or <HI>ludicrous</HI> emo|tions. Referring therefore to a future con&s;ideration, the propriety of introducing &s;erious parts in a Comedy, I &s;hall now lay down the character of Comedy as <HI>a dramatic compo&s;ition exhibiting a ludicrous picture of human life and manners.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are two &s;ources of ludicrous emotions which it is proper here to di&s;tingui&s;h. One of the&s;e ari&s;es from <HI>character,</HI> the other from <HI>incident.</HI> The fir&s;t is attached and appropriated to the per&s;on, and makes a part, as it were, of his compo&s;ition. The other is merely accidental, proceeding from aukward &s;ituations, odd and uncommon circum&s;tances, and the like, which may happen indifferently to every per&s;on. If we com|pare the&s;e with regard to their dignity and utility, we &s;hall find a further difference; &s;ince that proceeding from <HI>character</HI> belongs to a very re&s;pectable part of knowledge, that of human manners; and has for its end the correction of foibles: whereas that proceeding from <HI>incident</HI> is mean and trivial in its origin, and an|&s;wers no other purpo&s;e than pre&s;ent mirth. 'Tis true, it is perfectly natural to be plea&s;ed with ri&s;ible objects even of the lowe&s;t kind, and a fa&s;tidious aver&s;ion to their exhibition may be accounted mere affected nicety; yet &s;ince we rank Comedy among the higher and more refined &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, let us a&s;&s;ign it the more honourable office of exhibiting and correcting the ludi|crous part of <HI>characters;</HI> and leave to Bartholemew Fair the ingenious contrivances of facetious drollery, and handicraft merriment.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
THE following &s;ources may be pointed out from whence comic character is derived.</P>
<P>NATIONS, like individuals, have certain leading features which di&s;tingui&s;h them from others. Of the&s;e there are always &s;ome of a ludicrous ca&s;t which afford matter of entertainment to their neighbours. Comedy has at all times made very free with national peculiarities; and although the ridicule has often been conducted in a trivial and illiberal manner, by greatly overcharging the picture, and introducing idle and unju&s;t accu&s;ations, yet I think we need not go &s;o far as entirely to reject this &s;ort of ludicrous painting; &s;ince it may be as im|portant to warn again&s;t the imitation of foreign follies, as tho&s;e of our own growth. Indeed, when a French|man or Iri&s;hman is brought upon our &s;tage merely to talk broken Engli&s;h, or make bulls, there can be no plea either of wit or utility to excu&s;e the illiberal je&s;t: but when the nicer di&s;tinctions of national character are expo&s;ed with a ju&s;t and delicate ridicule, the &s;pectacle may be both intertaining and in&s;tructive. Amid&s;t the tribe of foreign valets to be met with on the Engli&s;h theatre, I would in&s;tance CANTON in the <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage</HI> as an admirable example of true national charac|ter, independent on language and grimace. The ob&s;equi|ou&s;ne&s;s and attentive flattery of the &s;ervile Swi&s;s-French|man are quite characteri&s;tic, as well as the carele&s;s in|&s;olence and affected airs of Bru&s;h the Engli&s;h footman.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I AM concerned to ob&s;erve an in&s;tance of illiberal national ri|dicule without any merit of compo&s;ition to palliate it, from a re|&s;pectable dramatic writer; which is al&s;o rendered much more ob|noxious by the circum&s;tances. Mr. Voltaire's <HI>Eco&s;&s;ai&s;e</HI> was purpo&s;e|ly written to exhibit a worthy Engli&s;h character; marked, indeed, with &s;ome whim&s;ical peculiarities, but di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;trong &s;pirit of benevolence. It was impo&s;&s;ible to expo&s;e national foibles more gently than by combining them with national virtues. When this piece was brought on our &s;tage under the title of the <HI>Engli&s;h Merchant,</HI> a French valet was in&s;erted among the <HI>per&s;onae dra|matis,</HI> characteri&s;ed by nothing but his fal&s;e Engli&s;h, and for no other end but to be exhibited as a &s;coundrel!</NOTE>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
O'FLAHERTY, the Iri&s;h &s;oldier of fortune in the <HI>We&s;t Indian,</HI> is an example of &s;imilar merit; much more &s;o, I think, than the character from which the piece has its title.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH &s;ome part of the character of a na|tion is pretty uniform and con&s;tant, yet its manners and cu&s;toms in many points are extremely variable. The&s;e variations are the peculiar modes and fa&s;hions of the age; and hence the age, as well as the nation, acquires a di&s;tingui&s;hing character. Fa&s;hion, in general, u&s;urps a dominion only over the &s;maller and le&s;s important part of manners; &s;uch as dre&s;s, public diver&s;ions, and other matters of ta&s;te. The improprieties of fa&s;hion are therefore of the ab&s;urd and ludicrous kind, and con&s;e|quently fit &s;ubjects of comic ridicule. There is no &s;ource of Comedy more fertile and plea&s;ing than this; and none in which the end of reformation is likely to be &s;o well an&s;wered. An extravagant fa&s;hion is exhibited upon the &s;tage with &s;uch advantage of ridicule that it can &s;carcely &s;tand long again&s;t it; and I make no doubt that Moliere's <HI>Marquis de Ma&s;carille,</HI> and Cibber's <HI>Lord Foppington</HI> had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in reforming the prevailing foppery of the times. Fa&s;hion has al&s;o too much interfered in &s;ome more &s;erious matters, as the &s;entiments and &s;tudies of the age. Here too Comedy has made its attacks; and the Alchemi&s;t, the Virtuo&s;o, the Antiquary, the Belle E&s;prit, have in their turns un|dergone the ridicule of the &s;tage, when their re&s;pective
<PB N="6" REF="7">
pur&s;uits, by being fa&s;hionable, were carried to a fanci|ful extravagance. It is well known that Moliere, in his comedies of the <HI>Femmes S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">avantes,</HI> and the <HI>Precieu&s;es Ridicules,</HI> was as &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the pedantry and preten&s;ions to wit which infected the French nation, and particularly the ladies, at that period, as Cervantes in his attack upon knight-errantry.</P>
<P>THERE is another point of national or fa&s;hionable folly in which Comedy might be very u&s;eful; yet the attempt has been found dangerous; and perhaps the &s;ubject is too delicate for the &s;tage, con&s;idering the a|bu&s;es to which it is liable. I mean popular &s;uper&s;tition, and prie&s;tcraft Moliere, who with impunity had attack|ed every other &s;pecies of folly, was almo&s;t ruined by expo&s;ing a hypocrite and a devotee; and the licentious ridicule of Dryden, and others of that age, was gene|rally aimed not only again&s;t &s;uper&s;tition, but religion. The <HI>Spani&s;h Friar,</HI> however, is an in&s;tance in which, with exqui&s;ite humour, the ridicule can hardly be blamed as improper; and it certainly did more hurt to Roman catholic &s;uper&s;tition than he could ever remedy by his &s;chola&s;tic <HI>Hind and Panther.</HI> How far the <HI>Minor</HI> comes under the &s;ame de&s;cription would, probably, be a &s;ub|ject of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR ranks and profe&s;&s;ions of men have likewi&s;e characteri&s;tical peculiarities which are capable of being placed in a ludicrous view; and Comedy has made frequent u&s;e of this &s;ource of ridicule. In expo&s;ing profe&s;&s;ional, as well as national ab&s;urdities, great illi|berality and unfairne&s;s have been &s;hown; both, pro|bably, from the &s;ame cau&s;e; a want of &s;ufficient ac|quaintance with the whole characters, and taking a
<PB N="7" REF="8">
judgment of them from a few external circum&s;tances. Yet, upon the whole, good effects may have ari&s;en even from this branch of Comedy; &s;ince by attacking a pro|fe&s;&s;ion on a &s;ide where it was really weak, the members of it have been made &s;en&s;ible of, and have reformed tho&s;e circum&s;tances which rendered them ridiculous. A good-natured phy&s;ician can never be angry at Mo|liere's mo&s;t laughable exhibitions of the faculty, when he reflects that the follies ridiculed, though exaggerated in the repre&s;entation, had a real exi&s;tence; and by being held up to public deri&s;ion have been in a great mea&s;ure reformed. The profe&s;&s;ors of law, being ne|ce&s;&s;arily confined to forms and rules, have not been able to benefit &s;o much from the comic ridicule of which they have enjoyed an equally plentiful &s;hare.</P>
<P>BESIDES the arrangements which nation and pro|fe&s;&s;ion make of mankind, there are certain natural cla&s;&s;es formed from the diver&s;ities of per&s;onal character. Although the varieties of temper and di&s;po&s;ition in men are infinite, &s;o that no two per&s;ons probably ever ex|i&s;ted in whom there was an exact conformity, yet there are certain leading features of character which produce a general re&s;emblance among numerous individuals. Thus the proud man, the vain, the &s;anguine, the &s;ple|netic, the &s;u&s;picious, the covetous, the lavi&s;h, and &s;o forth, are a &s;ort of ab&s;tract characters which divide the whole human race among&s;t them. Now there are, be|longing to all the&s;e, objects of ridicule which it has been the bu&s;ine&s;s of Comedy to exhibit; and though, per|haps, no one individual of each cla&s;s perfectly re&s;em|bled the per&s;on held to view on the &s;tage, yet if all the circum&s;tances exhibited are contained in the general character, it appears &s;ufficiently natural. The <HI>Mi&s;er</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
of Moliere is not a picture of any one mi&s;er who ever lived, but of a mi&s;er con&s;idered as forming a cla&s;s of human characters. As the&s;e general cla&s;&s;es, however, are few in number, they mu&s;t be &s;oon exhau&s;ted by the writers of Comedy; who have been obliged, for the &s;ake of variety, to exhibit tho&s;e peculiarities which are more rare and &s;ingular. Hence have been derived many pictures of that character which we call an <HI>humouri&s;t;</HI> by which is meant a character di&s;tingui&s;hed by certain ludicrous &s;ingularities from the re&s;t of mankind. The humouri&s;t is not without tho&s;e marks of di&s;tinction which he may acquire, like others, from rank, pro&s;e&s;&s;i|on, or temper of mind; but all the&s;e are di&s;played in him after a manner peculiarly his own, and da&s;hed with his leading oddities. A love of what is uncommon and out of the way has often occa&s;ioned &s;uch extravagance in the repre&s;entation of the&s;e characters as to di&s;gu&s;t from their want of probability; but where a due moderation is ob&s;erved, and the peculiarities, though unu&s;ual, are &s;uch as really exi&s;t in nature, great entertainment may be derived from their exhibition. Of this kind are the admirable <HI>Mi&s;anthrope</HI> and <HI>Malade Imaginaire</HI> of Mo|liere; and the <HI>Old Batchelor</HI> and <HI>Sir Samp&s;on Legend</HI> of Congreve.</P>
<P>FROM hence it appears but a &s;mall gradation to the exhibition of individuals upon the &s;tage; and yet the difference is important and e&s;&s;ential. That which marks out the di&s;tinction between individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies is &s;omething entirely uncommunicable; therefore the rational end of Comedy, which is the re|formation of folly, cannot take place in per&s;onal ridi|cule; for it will not be alledged that reforming the per&s;on him&s;elf is the object. Nor can it &s;carcely ever
<PB N="9" REF="10">
be ju&s;t to expo&s;e an individual to the ridicule of the &s;tage; &s;ince folly, and not vice, being the proper &s;ub|ject of that ridicule, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible any one can de|&s;erve &s;o &s;evere a puni&s;hment. Indeed the expo&s;ing of fol|ly can &s;carcely be the plea; for all the common, or even the rarer kinds of folly lie open to the attack of Comedy under fictitious characters, by means of which the fail|ing may be ridiculed without the per&s;on. Per&s;onal ri|dicule mu&s;t therefore turn, as we find it always has done, upon bodily imperfections, aukward habits and uncouth ge&s;tures; which the low arts of mimickry in|humanly drag forth to public view for the mean purpo&s;e of exciting pre&s;ent merriment. In the be&s;t hands per|&s;onal Comedy would be a degradation of the &s;tage, and an unwarrantable &s;everity; but in the hands it would be likely, if encouraged, to fall into, it would prove an intolerable nui&s;ance. I &s;hould therefore, without he&s;itation, join tho&s;e who utterly condemn this &s;pecies of comic ridicule. It is al&s;o to be con&s;idered that the author &s;hows his talents to di&s;advantage, and cannot lay any ba&s;is of future fame, in this walk. For the re|&s;emblance which depends &s;o much upon mimickry is lo&s;t upon tho&s;e of the audience who are not acquainted with the original, and upon every one who only reads the piece. Mr. Foote's works will aptly exemplify this matter; in which, the fund of genuine Comedy, de|rived from happy &s;trokes upon the manners of the times, and uncommon, but not entirely &s;ingular cha|racters, will &s;ecure a la&s;ting admiration, when the mi|mickry which &s;upported the parts of <HI>Squintum</HI> and <HI>Cad|wallader</HI> is de&s;pi&s;ed or forgotten.</P>
<P>HAVING thus attempted to trace the different &s;our|ces of what I conceive the e&s;&s;ential part of true Co|medy,

<HI>the ridicule derived from character,</HI> it remains to &s;ay &s;omewhat of the mixture of additional matter which it has received as a compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>DURING a con&s;iderable period of modern literature, <HI>wit</HI> was a commodity in great reque&s;t, and frequently to be met with in all kinds of compo&s;ition. It was no where more abundant than in Comedy, the genius of which it appeared peculiarly to &s;uit from its gaiety and &s;atyrical &s;martne&s;s. Accordingly, the language of Co|medy was a &s;tring of repartees, in which a thought was bandied about from one to another, till it was quite run out of breath. This made a &s;cene pa&s;s off with great vivacity; but the misfortune was, that di&s;tinction of character was quite lo&s;t in the conte&s;t. Every per|&s;onage, from the lord to the valet, was as witty as the author him&s;elf; and provided good things enow were &s;aid, it was no matter from whom they came. Con|greve, with the greate&s;t talents for true comic humour, and the delineation of ludicrous character, was &s;o over|run with a fondne&s;s for brilliancy, as frequently to break in upon con&s;i&s;tency. Wit is an admirable orna|ment of Comedy, and judiciou&s;ly applied is a high re|lief to humour; but &s;hould never interfere with the more e&s;&s;ential parts.</P>
<P>WE are now, however, happily free from all man|ner of danger of an inundation of wit. No Congreve ari&s;es to di&s;turb the &s;ententious gravity, and calm &s;im|plicity of modern Comedy. A morali&s;t may congratu|late the age on hearing from the theatre compo&s;itions, as pure, &s;erious and delicate, as are given from the pulpit. When we con&s;ider how much wit and humour, at the time they were mo&s;t prevalent, were perverted
<PB N="11" REF="14">
to vicious purpo&s;es, we may rejoice at the &s;acrifice; yet we may be allowed to feel a regret at the lo&s;s of an amu&s;ement which might, certainly, have been re|conciled with innocence; nay might perhaps have plead|ed utility beyond what is &s;ub&s;tituted in its room. <HI>Senti|mental Comedy,</HI> as it is called, contains but very faint di&s;crimination of character, and &s;carcely any thing of ridicule. Its principal aim is to introduce elegant and refined &s;entiment, particularly of the benevolent ca&s;t; and to move the heart by tender and intere&s;ting &s;itua|tions. Hence they are, in general, much more affect|ing than our modern Tragedies, which are formed up|on nearly the &s;ame plan, but labour under the di&s;ad|vantage of a formal, &s;tately &s;tile, and manners remov|ed too far from the rank of common life. One would not, perhaps, wi&s;h altogether to bani&s;h from the &s;tage pieces &s;o moral and innocent; yet it is a pity they are not di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome appropriated name from a thing they &s;o little re&s;emble as true Comedy.</P>
<P>I FEAR, a view of modern manners in other re&s;pects will &s;carcely allow us to flatter our&s;elves that this change in the theatre chiefly proceeds from improved morality. It may, perhaps, be more ju&s;tly attributed to a fal&s;e delicacy of ta&s;te, which renders us unable to bear the repre&s;entation of low life; and to a real de|ficiency in genius. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, genuine Comedy knows no di&s;tinction of rank, but can as hear|tily enjoy a humourous picture in the common walks of life, where indeed the greate&s;t variety is to be found, as in the mo&s;t cultivated and refined. Some have placed the di&s;tinction between Farce and Comedy in the rank from whence the characters are taken; but, I think, very improperly. If there is any real di&s;tinction be&s;ides
<PB N="12" REF="15">
the length of the pieces, I &s;hould take it from the dif|ferent &s;ource of the humour; which in Farce is mere ludicrous incident, but in Comedy, ridiculous charac|ter. This criterion, however, will not at all agree with the titles under which each &s;pecies has already appeared.</P>
<P>As to the other cau&s;e, deficiency of genius, it too plainly appears in many other productions. Cold cor|rectne&s;s has laid her repre&s;&s;ing hand upon imagination, and damped all her powers. The example of the anci|cients has been thought to ju&s;tify the gravity and &s;im|plicity of modern Comedy. But great as they were in many qualities of the mind, in tho&s;e of wit and humour they were &s;till more defective than even our&s;elves in the pre&s;ent age. They who would eagerly catch at a wretched pun, or a meagre piece of plot, were cer|tainly with-held from wittici&s;m and drollery by want of invention, not ju&s;tne&s;s of ta&s;te. I admire in the pure Latin of Terence the elegant &s;entiment, and &s;till more the knowledge of the human heart with which he abounds; but I would not for them compare his ge|nius, at lea&s;t in Comedy, with Moliere and Congreve.<Q><L>Lenibus atque utinam &s;criptis adjuncta &s;oret vis</L>
<L>Comica&mdash;</L></Q> Moral &s;entiment is the cheape&s;t product of the mind. Novels, and Magazines, and even News-papers are full of it; but wit and humour threaten to leave us with Sterne and Che&s;terfield.</P>
<P>STILL, however, I would hope the &s;tate of Comedy is not de&s;perate. The <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage</HI> exhibits an example of comic merit, as various and perfect as per|haps
<PB N="13" REF="16">
any piece in our language. All the &s;ources of ludicrous character have contributed to it. National ridicule appears in Canton, and profe&s;&s;ional in Ster|ling. Lord Ogleby is an excellent humouri&s;t. Mrs. Heidelberg and her niece, be&s;ides a comic petti&s;hne&s;s of temper, have plenty of fa&s;hionable follies, modifi|ed by city vulgari&s;m. Even the lovers of tender &s;enti|ment have their &s;hare in the entertainment; and I by no means would object to its occa&s;ional introduction, when, as it were, offering it&s;elf from the circum&s;tances. Then, be&s;ides Mr. Foote's comic theatre, we have &s;everal pieces, which, though ranged under the li&s;t of Farces, contain true and original Comedy. Of the&s;e we may in&s;tance the <HI>Citizen, Polly Honeycomb, the Uphol&s;terer, the Apprentice,</HI> and <HI>the Oxonian in Town.</HI> It is a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e that the matter of Comedy can ever fail. Though general characters may be exhau&s;ted, yet the prevailing follies and fa&s;hions of the times, with the &s;ingularities &s;tarting up in particular ranks and orders of men, mu&s;t con&s;tantly &s;upply food for the ridicule of the &s;tage. This is lawful game; and the pur&s;uit of it is well worthy the encouragement of the public, &s;o long as it is unattended with the licentiou&s;ne&s;s which di&s;graced the wit of the la&s;t age. Let ridicule be &s;acred to the intere&s;ts of good &s;en&s;e and virtue; let it never make a good character le&s;s re&s;pectable, nor a bad one le&s;s obnoxious. But let us not re&s;ign its u&s;e to common|place maxim, and in&s;ipid &s;entiment.</P>

<HEAD>THE HILL OF SCIENCE, A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>IN that &s;ea&s;on of the year when the &s;erenity of the &s;ky, the various fruits which cover the ground, the di&s;coloured foliage of the trees, and all the &s;weet, but fading graces of in&s;piring autumn, open the mind to benevolence, and di&s;po&s;e it for contemplation, I was wandering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curio&s;ity began to give way to wearine&s;s; and I &s;at me down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with mo&s;s, where the ru&s;tling of the falling leaves, the da&s;hing of waters, and the hum of the di&s;tant city, &s;oothed my mind into the mo&s;t perfect tranquility, and &s;leep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole upon me, as I was indulging the agreeable reveries which the objects around me natural|ly in&s;pired.</P>
<P>I IMMEDIATELY found my&s;elf in a va&s;t extended plain, in the middle of which aro&s;e a mountain higher than I had before any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of whom pre&s;&s;ed forwards with the livelie&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of ardor in their countenance, though the way was in many places &s;teep and difficult. I ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who had but ju&s;t begun to climb the hill, thought them|&s;elves not far from the top; but as they proceeded,
<PB N="15" REF="18">
new hills were continually ri&s;ing to their view, and the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t they could before di&s;cern, &s;eem|ed but the foot of another, till the mountain at length appeared to lo&s;e it&s;elf in the clouds. As I was gazing on the&s;e things with a&s;toni&s;hment, my good genius &s;ud|denly appeared. The mountain before thee, &s;aid he, is the HILL OF SCIENCE. On the top is the temple of Truth, who&s;e head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure light covers her face. Ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of her votaries; be &s;ilent and attentive.</P>
<P>I SAW that the only regular approach to the moun|tain was by a gate, called the gate of languages. It was kept by a woman of a pen&s;ive and thoughtful ap|pearance, who&s;e lips were continually moving, as though &s;he repeated &s;omething to her&s;elf. Her name was ME|MORY. On entering this fir&s;t enclo&s;ure, I was &s;tunned with a confu&s;ed murmur of jarring voices, and di&s;&s;o|nant &s;ounds; which encrea&s;ed on me to &s;uch a degree, that I was utterly confounded, and could compare the noi&s;e to nothing but the confu&s;ion of tongues at Babel. The road was al&s;o rough and &s;tony; and rendered more difficult by heaps of rubbi&s;h, continually tumbled down from the higher parts of the mountain; and broken ruins of antient buildings, which the travellers were obliged to climb over at every &s;tep; in&s;omuch that ma|ny, di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o rough a beginning, turned back and attempted the mountain no more: while others, having conquered this difficulty, had no &s;pirits to a&s;cend further, and &s;itting down on &s;ome fragment of the rub|bi&s;h, harangued the multitude below with the greate&s;t marks of importance and &s;elf-complacency.</P>
<P>ABOUT half way up the hill, I ob&s;erved on each
<PB N="16" REF="19">
&s;ide the path a thick fore&s;t covered with continual fogs, and cut out into labyrinths, cro&s;s alleys, and &s;erpentine walks, entangled with thorns and briars. This was called the <HI>wood of error:</HI> and I heard the voices of many who were lo&s;t up and down in it, calling to one ano|ther, and endeavouring in vain to extricate them&s;elves. The trees in many places &s;hot their boughs over the path, and a thick mi&s;t often re&s;ted on it; yet never &s;o much but that it was di&s;cernable by the light which beamed from the countenance of Truth.</P>
<P>IN the plea&s;ante&s;t part of the mountain were placed the bowers of the Mu&s;es, who&s;e office it was to cheer the &s;pirits of the travellers, and encourage their faint|ing &s;teps with &s;ongs from their divine harps. Not far from hence were the <HI>fields of fiction,</HI> filled with a variety of wild flowers &s;pringing up in the greate&s;t luxuriance, of richer &s;cents and brighter colours than I had ob&s;erved in any other climate. And near them was the <HI>dark walk of allegory,</HI> &s;o artificially &s;haded, that the light at noon|day was never &s;tronger than that of a bright moon-&s;hine. This gave it a plea&s;ingly romantic air for tho&s;e who delighted in contemplation. The paths and alleys were perplexed with intricate windings, and were all termi|nated with the &s;tatue of a Grace, a Virtue, or a Mu&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER I had ob&s;erved the&s;e things, I turned my eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the &s;teep a&s;cent, and ob&s;erved among&s;t them a youth of a lively look, a piercing eye, and &s;omething fiery and irregular in all his motions. His name was GENIUS. He darted like an eagle up the mountain, and left his compani|ons gazing after him with envy and admiration: but his progre&s;s was unequal, and interrupted by a thou&s;and
<PB N="17" REF="20">
caprices. When Plea&s;ure warbled in the valley he mingled in her train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice he ventured to the tottering edge. He delighted in devious and untried paths; and made &s;o many excur&s;ions from the road that his feebler compa|nions often out&s;tripped him. I ob&s;erved that the Mu&s;es beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned and turned a&s;ide her face. While Genius was thus wa&s;ting his &s;trength in excentric flights, I &s;aw a per&s;on of a very different appearance, named APPLICATION. He crept along with a &s;low and unremitting pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patiently remov|ing every &s;tone that ob&s;tructed his way, till he &s;aw mo&s;t of tho&s;e below him who had at fir&s;t derided his &s;low and toil&s;ome progre&s;s. Indeed there were few who a&s;cended the hill with equal and uninterrupted &s;teadine&s;s; for be&s;ide the difficulties of the way, they were continually &s;ollicited to turn a&s;ide by a numerous croud of Appe|tites, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Plea&s;ures, who&s;e importunity, when they had once complied with, they became le&s;s and le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t; and though they often returned to the path, the a&s;perities of the road were more &s;everely felt, the hill appeared more &s;teep and rugged, the fruits which were whol&s;ome and refre&s;hing &s;eemed har&s;h and ill-ta&s;ted, their &s;ight grew dim, and their feet tript at every little ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>I SAW, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, that the Mu&s;es, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to cheer and encourage tho&s;e who were toiling up the a&s;cent, would often &s;ing in the bowers of Plea&s;ure, and accompany tho&s;e who were enticed away at the call of the Pa&s;&s;ions. They accompanied them, however, but a little way, and always for&s;ook them when they lo&s;t &s;ight of the hill. The tyrants then
<PB N="18" REF="21">
doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives, and led them away without re&s;i&s;tance to the cells of Igno|rance, or the man&s;ions of Mi&s;ery. Among&s;t the innu|merable &s;educers, who were endeavouring to draw a|way the votaries of Truth from the path of Science, there was one, &s;o little formidable in her appearance, and &s;o gentle and languid in her attempts, that I &s;hould &s;carcely have taken notice of her, but for the numbers &s;he had imperceptibly loaded with her chains. INDO|LENCE (for &s;o &s;he was called) far from proceeding to open ho&s;tilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path, but contented her&s;elf with retarding their pro|gre&s;s; and the purpo&s;e &s;he could not force them to aban|don, &s;he per&s;uaded them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of the Torpedo, which withered the &s;trength of tho&s;e who came within its influence. Her unhappy captives &s;till turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the ground &s;eemed to &s;lide from beneath their feet, and they found them&s;elves at the bottom before they &s;u&s;pected they had changed their place. The placid &s;erenity which at fir&s;t appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom as they glided down the <HI>&s;tream of in&s;ignificance;</HI> a dark and &s;luggi&s;h water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead &s;ea, where the &s;tart|led pa&s;&s;engers are awakened by the &s;hock, and the next moment buried in the gulph of oblivion.</P>
<P>OF all the unhappy de&s;erters from the paths of Sci|ence, none &s;eemed le&s;s able to return than the followers of Indolence. The captives of Appetite and Pa&s;&s;ion could often &s;eize the moment when their tyrants were
<PB N="19" REF="22">
languid or a&s;leep to e&s;cape from their enchantment; but the dominion of Indolence was con&s;tant and unre|mitted, and &s;eldom re&s;i&s;ted till re&s;i&s;tance was in vain.</P>
<P>AFTER contemplating the&s;e things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was always pure and exhilerating, the path &s;haded with laurels and other ever-greens, and the effulgence which beamed from the face of the Godde&s;s &s;eemed to &s;hed a glory round her votaries. Happy, &s;aid I, are they who are permitted to a&s;cend the mountain!&mdash;but while I was pronouncing this exclamation with un|common ardour, I &s;aw &s;tanding be&s;ide me a form of divi|ner features and a more benign radiance. Happier, &s;aid &s;he, are tho&s;e whom VIRTUE conducts to the man&s;ions of Content! What, &s;aid I, does Virtue then re&s;ide in the vale? I am found, &s;aid &s;he, in the vale, and I illumi|nate the mountain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and in&s;pire the &s;age at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities, and ble&s;s the hermit in his cell. I have a temple in every heart that owns my influence; and to him that wi&s;hes for me I am already pre&s;ent. Sci|ence may rai&s;e you to eminence, but I alone can guide you to felicity! While the Godde&s;s was thus &s;peaking, I &s;tretched out my arms towards her with a vehemence which broke my &s;lumbers. The chill dews were fall|ing around me, and the &s;hades of evening &s;tretched o|ver the land&s;cape. I ha&s;tened homeward, and re&s;igned the night to &s;ilence and meditation.</P>

<HEAD>ON ROMANCES, AN IMITATION.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the multifarious productions which the efforts of &s;uperiour genius, or the labours of &s;chola&s;tic indu&s;try, have crowded upon the world, none are pe|ru&s;ed with more in&s;atiable avidity, or di&s;&s;eminated with more univer&s;al applau&s;e, than the narrations of feigned events, de&s;criptions of imaginary &s;cenes, and delinea|tions of ideal characters. The celebrity of other au|thors is confined within very narrow limits. The Geo|metrician and Divine, the Antiquary and Critic, how|ever di&s;tingui&s;hed by unconte&s;ted excellence, can only hope to plea&s;e tho&s;e whom a conformity of di&s;po&s;ition has engaged in &s;imilar pur&s;uits; and mu&s;t be content to be regarded by the re&s;t of the world with the &s;mile of frigid indifference, or the contemptuous &s;neer of &s;elf-&s;ufficient folly. The collector of &s;hells and the anatomi&s;t of in&s;ects is little inclined to enter into theolo|gical di&s;putes: the Divine is not apt to regard with veneration the uncouth diagrams and tedious calcula|tions of the A&s;tronomer: the man who&s;e life has been con&s;umed in adju&s;ting the di&s;putes of lexicographers, or elucidating the learning of antiquity, cannot ea&s;ily bend his thoughts to recent tran&s;actions, or readily in|tere&s;t him&s;elf in the unimportant hi&s;tory of his contem|poraries: and the Cit, who knows no bu&s;ine&s;s but acquiring wealth, and no plea&s;ure but di&s;playing it,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
has a heart equally &s;hut up to argument and fancy, to the batteries of &s;yllogi&s;m, and the arrows of wit. To the writer of fiction alone, every ear is open, and every tongue lavi&s;h of applau&s;e; curio&s;ity &s;parkles in every eye, and every bo&s;om is throbbing with concern.</P>
<P>IT is however ea&s;y to account for this enchantment. To follow the chain of perplexed ratiocination, to view with critical &s;kill the airy architecture of &s;y&s;tems, to unravel the web of &s;ophi&s;try, or weigh the merits of oppo&s;ite hypothe&s;es, requires per&s;picacity, and pre&s;up|po&s;es learning. Works of this kind, therefore, are not &s;o well adapted to the generality of readers as fa|miliar and colloquial compo&s;ition; for few can rea|&s;on, but all can feel; and many who cannot enter into an argument, may yet li&s;ten to a tale. The writer of Romance has even an advantage over tho&s;e who en|deavour to amu&s;e by the plea of fancy; who from the fortuitous colli&s;ion of di&s;&s;imilar ideas produce the &s;cin|tillations of wit; or by the vivid glow of poetical imagery delight the imagination with colours of ideal radiance. The attraction of the magnet is only ex|erted upon &s;imilar particles; and to ta&s;te the beauties of Homer it is requi&s;ite to partake his fire: but every one can reli&s;h the author who repre&s;ents common life, becau&s;e every one can refer to the originals from whence his ideas were taken. He relates events to which all are liable, and applies to pa&s;&s;ions which all have felt. The gloom of &s;olitude, the languor of inaction, the corro&s;ions of di&s;appointment, and the toil of thought, induce men to &s;tep a&s;ide from the rugged road of life, and wander in the fairy land of fiction; where every bank is &s;prinkled with flowers, and every gale loaded with perfume; where every event introduces a hero,
<PB N="22" REF="25">
and every cottage is inhabited by a Grace. Invited by the&s;e flattering &s;cenes, the &s;tudent quits the inve&s;ti|gation of truth, in which he perhaps meets with no le&s;s fallacy, to exhilerate his mind with new ideas, more agreeable, and more ea&s;ily attained: the bu&s;y relax their attention by de&s;ultory reading, and &s;mooth the agitation of a ruffled mind with images of peace, tranquility, and plea&s;ure: the idle and the gay relieve the li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of lei&s;ure, and diver&s;ify the round of life by a rapid &s;eries of events, pregnant with rap|ture and a&s;toni&s;hment; and the pen&s;ive &s;olitary fills up the vacuities of his heart by intere&s;ting him&s;elf in the fortunes of imaginary beings, and forming connections with ideal excellence.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, no ways extraordinary that the mind &s;hould be charmed by fancy, and attracted by plea&s;ure; but that we &s;hould li&s;ten to the groans of mi&s;ery, and delight to view the exacerbations of complicated an|gui&s;h, that we &s;hould chu&s;e to chill the bo&s;om with imaginary fears, and dim the eyes with fictitious &s;or|row, &s;eems a kind of paradox of the heart, and only to be credited becau&s;e it is univer&s;ally felt. Various are the hypothe&s;es which have been formed to account for the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind to riot in this &s;pecies of intellectual luxury. Some have imagined that we are induced to acquie&s;ce with greater patience in our own lot, by beholding pictures of life tinged with deeper horrors, and loaded with more excruciating calamities; as, to a per&s;on &s;uddenly emerging out of a dark room, the &s;ainte&s;t glimmering of twilight a&s;|&s;umes a lu&s;tre from the contra&s;ted gloom. Others, with yet deeper refinement, &s;uppo&s;e that we take upon our&s;elves this burden of ad&s;cititious &s;orrows in order
<PB N="23" REF="26">
to fea&s;t upon the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own virtue. We commi&s;erate others (&s;ay they) that we may ap|plaud our&s;elves; and the &s;igh of compa&s;&s;ionate &s;ym|pathy is always followed by the gratulations of &s;elf|complacent e&s;teem. But &s;urely they who would thus reduce the &s;ympathetic emotions of pity to a &s;y&s;tem of refined &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, have but ill attended to the ge|nuine feelings of humanity. It would however exceed the limits of this paper, &s;hould I attempt an accurate inve&s;tigation of the&s;e &s;entiments. But let it be remem|bered, that we are more attracted by tho&s;e &s;cenes which intere&s;t our pa&s;&s;ions, or gratify our curio&s;ity, than tho&s;e which delight our fancy: and &s;o far from being indifferent to the mi&s;eries of others, we are, at the time, totally regardle&s;s of our own. And let not tho&s;e, on whom the hand of time has impre&s;&s;ed the characters of oracular wi&s;dom, cen&s;ure with too much acrimony, productions which are thus calculated to plea&s;e the imagination, and intere&s;t the heart. They teach us to think, by inuring us to feel: they ven|tilate the mind by &s;udden gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion; and prevent the &s;tagnation of thought, by a fre&s;h infu&s;ion of di&s;&s;i|milar ideas.</P>

<HEAD>SELAMA; AN IMITATION OF OSSIAN.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT &s;oft voice of &s;orrow is in the breeze?&mdash;what lovely &s;un-beam of beauty trembling on the rock? Its bright hair is bathed in &s;howers; and it looks faint and dim, through its mi&s;t on the ru&s;hy plain. Why art thou alone&mdash;maid of the mournful look? The cold dropping rain is on the rocks of Tor|l&eacute;na&mdash;the bla&s;t of the de&s;art li&s;ts thy yellow locks. Let thy &s;teps be in the hall of &s;hells, by the blue winding &s;tream of Clutha:&mdash;let the harp tremble beneath thy fingers; and the &s;ons of heroes li&s;ten to the mu&s;ic of &s;ongs.</P>
<P>SHALL my &s;teps be in the hall of &s;hells, and the aged low in the du&s;t? The father of Sel&aacute;ma is low behind this rock, on his bed of wither'd leaves:&mdash;the thi&s;tle's down is &s;trewed over him by the wind, and mixes with his grey hair. Thou art fallen&mdash;chief of Etha! without thy fame; and there is none to revenge thy death. But thy daughter will &s;it, pale, be&s;ide thee, till &s;he &s;inks, a faded flower, upon thy lifele&s;s form. Leave the maid of Clutha&mdash;&s;on of the &s;tranger! in the red eye of her tears!</P>
<P>How fell the car-borne Connal&mdash;blue-eyed mourner of the rock? Mine arm is not weak in battle; nor my &s;word without its fame.</P>
<P>CONNAL was a fire in his youth, that lighten'd through fields of renown:&mdash;but the flame weakly glim|mered through grey a&s;hes of age. His cour&s;e was like
<PB N="25" REF="28">
a &s;tar moving through the heavens:&mdash;it walketh in brightne&s;s, but leaveth no track behind;&mdash;its &s;ilver path cannot be found in the &s;ky. The &s;trength of Etha is rolled away like a tale of other years; and his eyes have failed. Feeble and dark, he &s;its in his hall, and hears the di&s;tant tread of a &s;tranger's &s;teps&mdash;the haugh|ty &s;teps of Tonthormo, from the roar of Duvranno's echoing &s;tream. He &s;tood in the hall like a pillar of darkne&s;s, on who&s;e top is the red beam of fire:&mdash;wide rolled his eyes beneath the gloomy arch of his brow; as flames in two caves of a rock, over-hung with the black pine of the de&s;art. They had rolled on Sel&aacute;ma, and he a&s;ked the daughter of Connal. Tonthormo! breaker of &s;hields! thou art a meteor of death in war, who&s;e fiery hair &s;treams on the clouds, and the nations are withered beneath its path. Dwell, Tonthormo! amid&s;t thy hundred hills, and li&s;ten to thy torrent's roar; but the &s;oft &s;igh of the virgins is with the chief of Crono;&mdash;Hidallan is the dream of Sel&aacute;ma&mdash;the dweller of her &s;ecret thoughts. A ru&s;hing &s;torm in war&mdash;a breeze that &s;ighs over the fallen foe&mdash;plea&s;ant are thy words of peace, and thy &s;ongs at the mo&s;&s;y brook. Thy &s;miles are like the moon-beams trembling on the waves&mdash;Thy voice is the gale of &s;ummer that whi&s;pers among the reeds of the lake, and awakens the harp of Moilena with all its lightly trembling &s;trings. O that thy calm light was around me! my &s;oul &s;hould not fear the gloomy chief of Duvranno. He came with his &s;tately &s;teps.&mdash;My &s;hield is before thee, maid of my love! a wall of &s;helter from the lightning of &s;words. They fought. Tonthormo bends, in all his pride, before the arm of youth. But a voice was in the brea&s;t of Hidallan&mdash;&s;hall I &s;lay the love of Sel&aacute;ma?

Farewel, light of my &s;oul! They are clo&s;ed in darkne&s;s. Feeble wa&s;t thou then, my father! and in vain did&s;t thou call for help.&mdash;Thy grey locks are &s;catter'd, as a wreath of &s;now on the top of a wither'd trunk; which the boy bru&s;hes away with his &s;taff; and carele&s;s &s;ingeth as he walks.

Thoughts, like the troubled ocean, ru&s;h'd over his &s;oul&mdash;and he &s;truck, with his &s;pear, the &s;ounding pine. Starting, he mix'd in battle with the chief of woody Morna. Long was the &s;trife of arms; and the giant &s;ons of the fore&s;t trembled at their &s;trokes. At length Tonthormo fell&mdash;The &s;word of Reuthamir wav'd&mdash;a blue flame&mdash;around him. He bites the ground in rage. His blood is poured&mdash;a dark red &s;tream&mdash;into Oithona's trembling waves. Joy brigh|ten'd in the &s;oul of Reuthamir; when a young warrior came, with his forward &s;pear. He moved in the light of beauty; but his words were haughty and fierce. Is Tonthormo fallen in blood&mdash;the friend of my early years? Die&mdash;thou dark-&s;oul'd chief! for never &s;hall Sel&aacute;ma be thine&mdash;the maid of his love. Lovely &s;hone her eyes, through tears, in the hall of her grief, when I &s;tood by the chief of Duvranno, in the ri&s;ing &s;trife of Clutha.</P>
<P>RETIRE, thou &s;welling voice of pride! thy &s;pear is light as the taper reed. Pierce the roes of the de&s;art; and call the hunter to the fea&s;t of &s;ongs&mdash;But &s;peak not of the daughter of Connal&mdash;&s;on of the feeble arm! Sel&aacute;ma is the love of heroes.</P>
<P>TRY thy &s;trength with the feeble arm, &s;aid the ri&s;ing pride of youth. Thou &s;halt vani&s;h like a cloud of mi&s;t before the &s;un, when he looks abroad in the power of his brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT thou thy&s;elf did&s;t fall before Reuthamir, in all thy boa&s;ting words. As a tall a&s;h of the mountain&mdash;when the tempe&s;t takes its green head, and lays it level on the plain.</P>
<P>COME from thy &s;ecret cave, Sel&aacute;ma! thy foes are

&s;ilent and dark. Thou dove that hide&s;t in the clefts of the rocks! the &s;torm is over and pa&s;t. Come from thy rock, Sel&aacute;ma! and give thy white hand to the chief&mdash;who never fled from the face of glory, in all its terrible brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>SHE gave her hand&mdash;but it was trembling and cold&mdash;for the &s;pear was deep in her &s;ide. Red, beneath her mail, the current of crim&s;on wandered down her white brea&s;t&mdash;as the track of blood on Cromla's mountains of &s;now, when the wounded deer &s;lowly cro&s;&s;es the heath, and the hunters cries are in the breeze. Ble&s;t be the &s;pear of Reuthamir! &s;aid the faint voice of the lovely&mdash;I feel it cold in my heart. Lay me by the &s;on of Semo. Why &s;hould I know another love? Rai&s;e the tomb of the aged&mdash;his thin form &s;hall rejoice, as he &s;ails on a low-hung cloud, and guides the wintry &s;torm. Open your airy halls, &s;pirits of my love!</P>
<P>AND have I quench'd the light which was plea&s;ant to my &s;oul? &s;aid the chief of Morna. My &s;teps moved in darkne&s;s&mdash;why were the words of &s;trife in thy tale? Sor|row, like a cloud, comes over my &s;oul, and &s;hades the joy of mighty deeds. Soft be your re&s;t in the narrow hou&s;e, children of grief! The breeze in the long whi&s;tling gra&s;s &s;hall not awaken you. The tempe&s;t &s;hall ru&s;h over you, and the bulru&s;h bow its head upon your tomb&mdash;but &s;i|lence &s;hall dwell in your habitation; long repo&s;e, and the peace of years to come.

Often &s;hall the harp &s;end forth a mournful found; and the tear dwell in the &s;oft eyes of the daughters of Morna.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Reuthamir, while he rai&s;ed the tombs of the fallen. Sad were his &s;teps towards the tow|ers of his fathers, as&mdash;mu&s;ing&mdash;he cro&s;s'd the dark heath of Lena, and &s;truck&mdash;at times&mdash;the thi&s;tle's beard.</P>

man expects to pre&s;erve oranges through an Engli&s;h win|ter; or when he has planted an acorn, to &s;ee it become a large oak in a few months. The mind of man natu|rally yields to nece&s;&s;ity; and our wi&s;hes &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide when we &s;ee the impo&s;&s;ibility of their being gratified. Now, upon an accurate in&s;pection, we &s;hall find, in the moral government of the world, and the order of the intellectual &s;y&s;tem, laws as determinate, fixed, and in|variable as any in Newton's Principia. The progre&s;s of vegetation is not more certain than the growth of habit; nor is the power of attraction more clearly proved than the force of affection, or the influence of example. The man, therefore, who has well &s;tudied the operations of nature in mind as well as matter, will acquire a certain moderation and equity in his claims upon Providence. He never will be di&s;appointed either in him&s;elf or others. He will act with preci&s;ion; and expect that effect, and that alone, from his efforts, which they are naturally adapted to produce. For want of this, men of merit and integrity often cen&s;ure the di&s;po&s;itions of Provi|dence for &s;uffering characters they de&s;pi&s;e to run away with advantages which, they yet know, are purcha&s;ed by &s;uch means as a high and noble &s;pirit could never &s;ubmit to. If you refu&s;e to pay the price, why expect the purcha&s;e? We &s;hould con&s;ider this world as a great mart of commerce, where Fortune expo&s;es to our view various commodities, riches, ea&s;e, tranquility, fame, integrity, knowledge. Every thing is marked at a &s;ettled price. Our time, our labour, our ingenuity, is &s;o much ready money which we are to lay out to the be&s;t advan|tage. Examine, compare, chu&s;e, reject; but &s;tand to your own judgment; and do not, like children, when you have purcha&s;ed one thing, repine that you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s another which you did not purcha&s;e.

<P>I MUCH admire the &s;pirit of the antient philo&s;ophers, in that they never attempted, as our morali&s;ts often do, to lower the tone of philo&s;ophy, and make it con&s;i&s;tent with all the indulgences of indolence and &s;en&s;uality. They never thought of having the bulk of mankind for their di&s;ciples; but kept them&s;elves as di&s;tinct as po&s;&s;ible from a worldly life. They plainly told men what &s;acri|fices were required, and what advantages they were which might be expected.<Q><L>Si virtus hoc una pote&s;t dare, fortis omi&s;&s;is</L>

If you would be a philo&s;opher the&s;e are the terms. You mu&s;t do thus and thus: There is no other way. If not, go and be one of the vulgar.</P>
<P>THERE is no one quality gives &s;o much dignity to a character as con&s;i&s;tency of conduct. Even if a man's pur&s;uits be wrong and unju&s;tifiable, yet if they are pro|&s;ecuted with &s;teadine&s;s and vigour, we cannot with-hold our admiration. The mo&s;t characteri&s;tic mark of a great mind is to chu&s;e &s;ome one important object, and pur&s;ue it through life. It was this made Cae&s;ar a great man. His object was ambition; he pur&s;ued it &s;teadily, and was always ready to &s;acrifice to it every interfering pa&s;&s;ion or inclination.</P>
<P>THERE is a pretty pa&s;&s;age in one of Lucian's dia|logues, where Jupiter complains to Cupid that though he has had &s;o many intrigues he was never &s;incerely be|loved. In order to be loved, &s;ays Cupid, you mu&s;t lay a&s;ide your aegis and your thunder-bolts, and you mu&s;t curl and perfume your hair, and place a garland on your head, and walk with a &s;oft &s;tep, and a&s;&s;ume a winning ob&s;equious deportment. But, replied Jupiter, I am not willing to re&s;ign &s;o much of my dignity. Then, returns Cupid, leave off de&s;iring to be loved&mdash;He wanted to be Jupiter and Adonis at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that men of genius are of all others mo&s;t inclined to make the&s;e unrea&s;onable claims. As their reli&s;h for enjoyment is &s;trong, their views large and comprehen&s;ive, and they feel them&s;elves lifted a|bove the common bulk of mankind, they are apt to &s;light that natural reward of prai&s;e and admiration which is ever largely paid to di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities; and to ex|pect to be called forth to publick notice and favour: without con&s;idering that their talents are commonly very unfit for active life; that their excentricity and turn for
<PB N="35" REF="38">
&s;peculation di&s;qualifies them for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, which is be&s;t carried on by men of moderate genius; and that &s;ociety is not obliged to reward any one who is not u&s;eful to it. The Poets have been a very unrea&s;onable race, and have often complained loudly of the neglect of genius and the ingratitude of the age. The tender and pen&s;ive Cowley, and the ele|gant Shen&s;tone, had their minds tinctured by this di&s;|content; and even the &s;ublime melancholy of Young was too much owing to the &s;tings of di&s;appointed am|bition.</P>
<P>THE moderation we have been endeavouring to in|culcate will likewi&s;e prevent much mortification and di&s;|gu&s;t in our commerce with mankind. As we ought not to wi&s;h in our&s;elves, &s;o neither &s;hould we expect in our friends contrary qualifications. Young and &s;anguine, when we enter the world, and feel our affections drawn forth by any particular excellence in a character, we immediately give it credit for all others; and are beyond mea&s;ure di&s;gu&s;ted when we come to di&s;cover, as we &s;oon mu&s;t di&s;cover, the defects in the other &s;ide of the balance. But nature is much more frugal than to heap together all manner of &s;hining qualities in one glaring ma&s;s. Like a judicious painter &s;he endeavours to pre&s;erve a certain unity of &s;tile and colouring in her pieces. Models of ab&s;olute perfection are only to be met with in romance; where exqui&s;ite beauty, and bril|liant wit, and profound judgment, and immaculate vir|tue are all blended together to adorn &s;ome favourite character. As an anatomi&s;t knows that the racer can|not have the &s;trength and mu&s;cles of the draught-hor&s;e; and that winged men, gryffons, and mermaids mu&s;t be mere creatures of the imagination; &s;o the philo&s;opher is &s;en&s;ible that there are combinations of moral qualities
<PB N="36" REF="39">
which never can take place but in idea. There is a different air and complexion in characters as well as in faces, though perhaps each equally beautiful; and the excellencies of one cannot be transferred to the other. Thus if one man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;toical apathy of &s;oul, acts independent of the opinion of the world, and fulfils every duty with mathematical exactne&s;s, you mu&s;t not expect that man to be greatly influenced by the weakne&s;s of pity, or the partialities of friend&s;hip: you mu&s;t not be offended that he does not fly to meet you after a &s;hort ab&s;ence; or require from him the convivial &s;pirit and hone&s;t effu&s;ions of a warm, open, &s;u&s;ceptible heart. If another is remarkable for a lively active zeal, inflexible integrity, a &s;trong indignation again&s;t vice, and free|dom in reproving it, he will probably have &s;ome little bluntne&s;s in his addre&s;s not altogether &s;uitable to poli&s;h|ed life; he will want the winning arts of conver&s;ation; he will di&s;gu&s;t by a kind of haughtine&s;s and negligence in his manner, and often hurt the delicacy of his ac|quaintance with har&s;h and di&s;agreeable truths.</P>
<P>WE u&s;ually &s;ay&mdash;that man is a genius, <HI>but</HI> he has &s;ome whims and oddities&mdash;&s;uch a one has a very general knowledge, <HI>but</HI> he is &s;uperficial; &amp;c. Now in all &s;uch ca&s;es we &s;hould &s;peak more rationally did we &s;ub&s;titute <HI>therefore</HI> for <HI>but.</HI> He is a genius, <HI>therefore</HI> he is whim|&s;ical; and the like.</P>
<P>IT is the fault of the pre&s;ent age, owing to the freer commerce that different ranks and profe&s;&s;ions now enjoy with each other, that characters are not marked with &s;ufficient &s;trength: the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es run too much into one another. We have fewer pedants, it is true, but we have fewer &s;triking originals. Every one is expected to have &s;uch a tincture of general knowledge as is in|compatible with going deep into any &s;cience; and &s;uch
<PB N="37" REF="40">
a conformity to fa&s;hionable manners as checks the free workings of the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and gives an in&s;ipid &s;ame|ne&s;s to the face of &s;ociety, under the idea of poli&s;h and regularity.</P>
<P>THERE is a ca&s;t of manners peculiar and becom|ing to each age, &s;ex and profe&s;&s;ion; one, therefore, &s;hould not throw out illiberal and common-place cen|&s;ures again&s;t another. Each is perfect in their kind. A woman as a woman: a trade&s;man as a trade&s;man. We are often hurt by the brutality and &s;luggi&s;h conceptions of the vulgar; not con&s;idering that &s;ome there mu&s;t be to be hewers of wood and drawers of water, and that cultivated genius, or even any great refinement and de|licacy in their moral feelings would be a real misfortune to them.</P>
<P>LET us then &s;tudy the philo&s;ophy of the human mind. The man who is ma&s;ter of this &s;cience will know what to expect from every one. From this man, wi&s;e advice; from that, cordial &s;ympathy; from another, ca&s;ual en|tertainment. The pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations of others are his tools, which he can u&s;e with as much preci&s;ion as he would the mechanical powers; and he can as readily make allowance for the workings of vanity, or the bia&s;s of &s;elf-intere&s;t in his friends, as for the power of friction, or the irregularities of the needle.</P>

<HEAD>THE CANAL AND THE BROOK. A REVERIE.</HEAD>
<P>A Delightfully plea&s;ant evening &s;ucceeding a &s;ultry &s;ummer-day, invited me to take a &s;olitary walk; and leaving the du&s;t of the highway, I fell into a path which led along a plea&s;ant little valley watered by a &s;mall meandring brook. The meadow-ground on its banks had been lately mown, and the new gra&s;s was &s;pringing up with a lively verdure. The brook was hid in &s;everal places by &s;hrubs that grew on each &s;ide, and intermingled their branches. The &s;ides of the valley were roughened by &s;mall irregular thickets; and the whole &s;cene had an air of &s;olitude and retirement, un|common in the neighbourhood of a populous town. The Duke of Bridgewater's canal cro&s;&s;ed the valley, high rai&s;ed on a mound of earth, which pre&s;erved a level with the elevated ground on each &s;ide. An arched road was carried under it, beneath which the brook that ran along the valley was conveyed by a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;|&s;age. I threw my&s;elf upon a green bank, &s;haded by a leafy thicket, and re&s;ting my head upon my hand, after a welcome indolence had overcome my &s;en&s;es, I &s;aw, with the eyes of fancy, the following &s;cene.</P>

naked feet were di&s;coloured with clay. On his left &s;houlder he bore a huge pick-ax; and in his right hand he held certain in&s;truments, u&s;ed in &s;urveying and level|ling. His looks were thoughtful, and his features har&s;h. The breach through which he proceeded, in&s;tantly clo|&s;ed; and with a heavy tread he advanced into the val|ley. As he approached the brook, the <HI>Deity of the Stream</HI> aro&s;e to meet him. He was habited in a light green mantle, and the clear drops fell from his dark hair, which was encircled with a wreath of water-lily, inter|woven with &s;weet &s;cented flag. An angling rod &s;up|ported his &s;teps. The Genius of the Canal eyed him with a contemptuous look, and in a hoar&s;e voice thus began.</P>

The philo&s;opher and poet, by who&s;e labours the human mind is elevated and refined, and opened to plea&s;ures beyond the con|ception of vulgar &s;ouls, will acknowledge, that the elegant deities who pre&s;ide over &s;imple and natural beauty, have in&s;pired them with their charming and in&s;tructive ideas. The &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t maje&s;tic bard that ever &s;ung, has taken a pride in owning his affection to woods and &s;treams; and while the &s;tupen|dous monuments of Roman grandeur, the columns which pierced the &s;kies, and the aqueducts which poured their waves over mountains and vallies, are &s;unk in oblivion, the gently winding Mincius &s;till re|tains his tranquil honours. And when thy glories, proud Genius! are lo&s;t and forgotten; when the flood of commerce, which now &s;upplies thy urn, is turned into another cour&s;e, and has left thy channel dry and de&s;olate; the &s;oftly flowing Avon &s;hall &s;till murmur in &s;ong, and his banks receive the homage of all who are beloved by Phoebus and the Mu&s;es."</Q></P>

<P>I Happened the other day to take a &s;olitary walk a|mong&s;t the venerable ruins of an old Abbey. The &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olemnity of the place were favourable to thought, and naturally led me to a train of ideas rela|tive to the &s;cene; when, like a good prote&s;tant, I began to indulge a &s;ecret triumph in the ruin of &s;o many &s;tructures which I had always con&s;idered as the haunts of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>YE are fallen, &s;aid I, ye dark and gloomy man&s;ions of mi&s;taken zeal, where the proud prie&s;t and lazy monk fatten'd upon the riches of the land, and crept like ver|min from their cells to &s;pread their poi&s;onous doctrines through the nation, and di&s;turb the peace of kings. Ob|&s;cure in their origin, but daring and ambitious in their guilt! See how the pure light of heaven is clouded by the dim gla&s;s of the arched window, &s;tained with the gaudy colours of monki&s;h tales and legendary fiction; fit emblem how reluctantly they admitted the fairer light of truth amid&s;t the&s;e dark rece&s;&s;es, and how much they have deba&s;ed its genuine lu&s;tre! The low cells, the long and narrow ai&s;les, the gloomy arches, the damp and &s;ecret caverns which wind beneath the hollow ground, far from impre&s;&s;ing on the mind the idea of the God of truth and love, &s;eem only fit for tho&s;e dark places of the earth in which are the habitations of cru|elty. The&s;e ma&s;&s;y &s;tones and &s;cattered reliques of the va&s;t edifice, like the large bones and gigantick armour of a once formidable ruffian, produce emotions of ming|led

dread and exultation. Farewel, ye once venerated &s;eats! enough of you remains, and may it always re|main, to remind us from what we have e&s;caped, and make po&s;terity for ever thankful for this fairer age of liberty and light.</P>
<P>SUCH were for a while my meditations; but it is cruel to in&s;ult a fallen enemy, and I gradually fell into a different train of thought. I began to con&s;ider whether &s;omething might not be advanced in favour of the&s;e in|&s;titutions during the barbarous ages in which they flou|ri&s;hed; and though they have been productive of much mi&s;chief and &s;uper&s;tition, whether they might not have &s;pread the glimmering of a feeble ray of knowledge, through that thick night which once involved the we&s;tern hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>AND where, indeed, could the precious remains of cla&s;&s;ical learning, and the divine monuments of ancient ta&s;te, have been &s;afely lodged amid&s;t the ravages of that age of ferocity and rapine which &s;ucceeded the de&s;ola|tion of the Roman empire, except in &s;anctuaries like the&s;e, con&s;ecrated by the &s;uper&s;tition of the times beyond their intrin&s;ic merit? The frequency of wars, and the licentious cruelty with which they were conducted, left neither the hamlet of the pea&s;ant nor the ca&s;tle of the baron free from depredation; but the church and mo|na&s;tery generally remained inviolate. There Homer and Ari&s;totle were obliged to &s;hroud their heads from the rage of gothic ignorance; and there the &s;acred re|cords of divine truth were pre&s;erved, like trea&s;ure hid in the earth in trouble&s;ome times, &s;afe, but unenjoyed. Some of the barbarous nations were converted before their conque&s;ts, and mo&s;t of them &s;oon after their &s;ettle|ment in the countries they over-ran. Tho&s;e buildings which their new faith taught them to venerate, afforded
<PB N="44" REF="47">
a &s;helter for tho&s;e voluable manu&s;cripts, which mu&s;t o|therwi&s;e have been de&s;troyed in the common wreck. At the revival of learning they were produced from their dormitories. A copy of the pandect of Ju&s;tinian, that valuable remain of Roman law, which fir&s;t gave to Europe the idea of a more perfect juri&s;prudence, and gave men a reli&s;h for a new and important &s;tudy, was di&s;covered in a mona&s;tery of Amalphi. Mo&s;t of the cla&s;&s;ics were recovered by the &s;ame means; and to this it is owing, to the books and learning pre&s;erved in the&s;e repo&s;itories, that we were not obliged to begin anew, and trace every art by &s;low and uncertain &s;teps from its fir&s;t origin. Science, already full grown and vigorous, awaked as from a trance, &s;hook her pinions, and &s;oon &s;oared to the heights of knowledge.</P>
<P>NOR was &s;he entirely idle during her rece&s;s; at lea&s;t we cannot but confe&s;s that what little learning remain|ed in the world was among&s;t the prie&s;ts and religious orders. Books, before the invention of paper, and the art of printing, were &s;o dear, that few private per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any. The only libraries were in convents; and the monks were often employed in tran&s;cribing ma|nu&s;cripts, which was a very tedious, and at that time a very nece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k. It was frequently enjoined as a penance for &s;ome &s;light offence, or given as an exerci&s;e to the younger part of the community. The monks were obliged by their rules to &s;pend &s;ome &s;tated hours every day in reading and &s;tudy; nor was any one to be cho&s;en abbot without a competent &s;hare of learning. They were the only hi&s;torians; and though their ac|counts be interwoven with many a legendary tale, and darkened by much &s;uper&s;tition, &s;till they are better than no hi&s;tories at all; and we cannot but think our&s;elves
<PB N="45" REF="48">
obliged to them for tran&s;mitting to us, in any dre&s;s, the annals of their country.</P>
<P>THEY were likewi&s;e almo&s;t the &s;ole in&s;tructors of youth. Towards the end of the tenth century there were no &s;chools in Europe but the mona&s;teries, and tho&s;e which belonged to epi&s;copal re&s;idences; nor any ma&s;ters but the Benedictines. It is true, their cour&s;e of educa|tion extended no further than what they called the &s;even liberal arts, and the&s;e were taught in a very dry and un|intere&s;ting manner. But this was the genius of the age, and it &s;hould not be imputed to them as a reproach that they did not teach well, when no one taught better. We are guilty of great unfairne&s;s when we compare the &s;choolmen with the philo&s;ophers of a more enlightened age: we &s;hould contra&s;t them with tho&s;e of their own times; with a high-con&s;table of France who could not read; with kings who made the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in con|firmation of their charters, becau&s;e they could not write their names; with a whole people without the lea&s;t glimmering of ta&s;te or literature. Whatever was their real knowledge, there was a much greater difference be|tween men of learning, and the bulk of the nation, at that time, than there is at pre&s;ent; and certainly, &s;ome of the di&s;ciples of tho&s;e &s;chools who, though now fallen into di&s;repute, were revered in their day by the name of the &s;ubtle doctor, or the angelic doctor, &s;hewed an acute|ne&s;s and &s;trength of genius, which, if properly directed, would have gone far in philo&s;ophy; and they only fail|ed becau&s;e their enquires were not the objects of the hu|man power. Had they exerci&s;ed half that acutene&s;s on facts and experiments, they had been truly great men. However, there were not wanting &s;ome, even in the darke&s;t ages, who&s;e names will be always remembered with plea&s;ure by the lovers of &s;cience. Alcuin, the pre|ceptor
<PB N="46" REF="49">
of Charlemagne; the fir&s;t who introduced a ta&s;te for polite literature into France, and the chief in&s;tru|ment that prince made u&s;e of in his noble endeavours for the encouragement of learning; to whom the univer&s;i|ties of Soi&s;&s;ons, Tours and Paris owe their origin. The hi&s;torians, Mathew Paris, William of Malm&s;bury. Sa|vanarola; the elegant and unfortunate Abelard; and, to crown the re&s;t, the Engli&s;h Franci&s;can, Roger Ba|con.</P>
<P>IT may be here ob&s;erved, that forbidding the vulgar tongue in the offices of devotion, and in reading the &s;criptures, though undoubtedly a great corruption in the Chri&s;tian Church, was of infinite &s;ervice to the intere&s;ts of learning. When the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had locked up their religion in a foreign tongue, they would take care not to lo&s;e the key. This gave an importance to the learn|ed languages; and every &s;cholar could not only read, but wrote and di&s;puted in Latin, which without &s;uch a motive would probably have been no more &s;tudied than the Chine&s;e. And at a time when the modern languages of Europe were yet unformed and barbarous, Latin was of great u&s;e as a kind of univer&s;al tongue, by which learned men might conver&s;e and corre&s;pond with each other.</P>
<P>INDEED, the monks were almo&s;t the only &s;et of men who had lei&s;ure or opportunity to pay the lea&s;t attention to literary &s;ubjects. A learned education (and a very little went to that title) was reckoned peculiar to the religious. It was almo&s;t e&s;teemed a blemi&s;h on the &s;a|vage and martial character of the gentry to have any tincture of letters. A man, therefore, of a &s;tudious and retired turn, a ver&s;e to quarrels, and not de&s;irous of the fierce and &s;anguinary glory of tho&s;e times, beheld in the cloi&s;ter a peaceful and honourable &s;anctuary; where,
<PB N="47" REF="50">
without the reproach of cowardice, or danger of inva|&s;ion, he might devote him&s;elf to learning, a&s;&s;ociate with men of his own turn, and have free acce&s;s to libraries and manu&s;cripts. In this enlightened and poli&s;hed age, where learning is diffu&s;ed through every rank, and many a merchant's clerk po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more real knowledge than half the literati of that aera, we can &s;carcely conceive how gro&s;s an ignorance over&s;pread tho&s;e times, and how totally all u&s;eful learning might have been lo&s;t among&s;t us, had it not been for an order of men, ve&s;ted with pe|culiar privileges, and protected by even a &s;uper&s;titious degree of reverence.</P>
<P>THUS the Mu&s;es, with their attendant arts (in &s;trange di&s;gui&s;e indeed, and uncouth trappings) took re|fuge in the peaceful gloom of the convent. Statuary carved a Madona or a crucifix. Painting illuminated a mi&s;&s;al. Eloquence made the panegyric of a &s;aint; and Hi&s;tory compo&s;ed a legend. Yet &s;till they breathed, and were ready at any happier period, to emerge from ob&s;curity with all their native charms and undimini&s;hed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>BUT there were other views in which tho&s;e who de|voted them&s;elves to a mona&s;tic life might be &s;uppo&s;ed u&s;eful to &s;ociety. They were often employed either in cultivating their gardens, or in curious mechanical works; as indeed, the nuns are &s;till famous for many elegant and ingenious manufactures. By the con&s;tant communication they had with tho&s;e of their own order, and with their common head at Rome, they maintained &s;ome intercour&s;e between nations at a time when travel|ling was dangerous, and commerce had not, as now, made the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the globe familiar to each other: and they kept up a more intimate bond of union among&s;t learned men of all countries, who would other|wi&s;e
<PB N="48" REF="51">
have been &s;ecluded from all knowledge of each o|ther. A monk might travel with more convenience than any one el&s;e; his per&s;on was &s;afer, and he was &s;ure of meeting with proper accommodations. The in|tercour&s;e with Rome mu&s;t have been peculiarly favour|able to the&s;e northern nations; as Italy for a long time led the way in every improvement of politene&s;s or litera|ture: and if we imported their &s;uper&s;tition, we likewi&s;e imported their manufactures, their knowledge, and their ta&s;te. Thus Alfred &s;ent for Italian monks, when he wanted to civilize his people, and introduce among&s;t them &s;ome tincture of letters. It may likewi&s;e be pre|&s;umed that they tempered the rigour of monarchy. In|deed they, as well as the &s;overeigns, endeavoured to en&s;lave the people; but &s;ubjection was not likely to be &s;o abject and unlimited where the object of it was di|vided, and each &s;howed by turns that the other might be oppo&s;ed. It mu&s;t have been of &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of liberty to have a &s;et of men, who&s;e laws, privileges and immunities the mo&s;t daring kings were afraid to trample on; and this, before a more enlightened &s;pirit of freedom had ari&s;en, might have its effect in prevent|ing the &s;tates of chri&s;tendom from falling into &s;uch en|tire &s;lavery as the A&s;iatics.</P>
<P>SUCH an order would in &s;ome degree check the ex|ce&s;&s;ive regard paid to birth. A man of mean origin and ob&s;cure parentage &s;aw him&s;elf excluded from almo&s;t every path of &s;ecular preferment, and almo&s;t treated as a being of an inferior &s;pecies by the high and haughty &s;pirit of the gentry; but he was at liberty to a&s;pire to the highe&s;t dignities of the church; and there have been many who, like Sextus V. and cardinal Wol|&s;ey, have by their indu&s;try and per&s;onal merit alone rai&s;ed them&s;elves to a level with kings.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
IT &s;hould likewi&s;e be remembered that many of the orders were charitable in&s;titutions; as the <HI>knights of faith and charity</HI> in the thirteenth century, who were a&s;&s;ociat|ed for the purpo&s;e of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e bands of robbers which infe&s;ted the public roads in France; the <HI>brethren of the order of the redemption,</HI> for redeeming &s;laves from the Mahometans; the <HI>order of St. Anthony,</HI> fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ed for the relief of the poor under certain di&s;orders; and the <HI>brethren and &s;i&s;ters of the pious and chri&s;tian &s;chools,</HI> for educating poor children. The&s;e &s;upplied the place of ho&s;pitals and other &s;uch foundations, which are now e&s;tabli&s;hed on the broader ba&s;is of public bene|volence. To bind up the wounds of the &s;tranger was peculiarly the office of the inhabitants of the convent; and they often &s;hared the charities they received. The exerci&s;e of ho&s;pitality is &s;till their characteri&s;tic, and mu&s;t have been of particular u&s;e formerly, when they had not the conveniences and accommodations for tra|velling which we now enjoy. The learned &s;tranger was always &s;ure of an agreeable re&s;idence among&s;t them; and as they all under&s;tood latin, they &s;erved him for in|terpreters, and introduced him to a &s;ight of whatever was curious or valuable in the countries which he vi&s;it|ed. They checked the &s;pirit of &s;avage fiercene&s;s, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> warlike ance&s;tors were &s;o prone, with the mildne&s;s and &s;anctity of religious influences; they pre|&s;erved &s;ome re&s;pect to law and order, and often decided controver&s;ies by means le&s;s bloody than the &s;word, though confe&s;&s;edly more &s;uper&s;titious.</P>
<P>A PROOF that the&s;e in&s;titutions had a favourable a&s;pect towards civilization, may be drawn from a late hi&s;tory of Ireland. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Soon after the introduction of chri&s;tianity into that kingdom"</Q> &s;ays Dr. Leland, <Q>"the monks fixed their habitations in de&s;arts, which
<PB N="50" REF="53">
they cultivated with their own hands, and ren|dered the mo&s;t delightful &s;pots in the kingdom. The&s;e de&s;arts became well policed cities, and it is re|markable enough that to the monks we owe &s;o u&s;eful an in&s;titution in Ireland as the bringing great numbers together into one civil community. In the&s;e cities the monks &s;et up &s;chools, and taught, not only the youth of Ireland, but the neighbouring nations; fur|ni&s;hing them al&s;o with books. They became umpires between contending chiefs, and when they could not confine them within the bounds of rea&s;on and religi|on, at lea&s;t terrified them by denouncing divine ven|geance again&s;t their exce&s;&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>LET it be con&s;idered too, that when the minds of men began to open, &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent reformers &s;prung from the bo&s;om of the church, and even of the convent. It was not the laity who began to think. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics were the fir&s;t to perceive the errors they had introduced. The church was reformed from within, not from without; and like the &s;ilk-worm, when ripen|ed in their cells to maturer vigour and perfection, they pierced the cloud them&s;elves had &s;pun, and within which they had &s;o long been enveloped.</P>
<P>AND let not the good prote&s;tant be too much &s;tart|led if I here venture to in&s;inuate, that the mona&s;teries were &s;chools of &s;ome high and re&s;pectable virtues. Po|verty, cha&s;tity, and a renunciation of the world, were certainly intended in the fir&s;t plan of the&s;e in&s;titutions; and though, from the unavoidable frailty of human na|ture, they were not always ob&s;erved, certain it is, that many individuals among&s;t them have been &s;triking ex|amples of the &s;elf-denying virtues: and as the influence they acquired was only built upon the voluntary ho|mage of the mind, it may be pre&s;umed &s;uch an a&s;cen|dancy
<PB N="51" REF="54">
was not originally gained without &s;ome &s;pecies of merit. The fondne&s;s for monkery is ea&s;ily deduced from &s;ome of the be&s;t principles in the human heart. It was, indeed, nece&s;&s;ity, that, in the third century, fir&s;t drove the chri&s;tians to &s;helter them&s;elves from the Decian per&s;ecution in the &s;olitary de&s;erts of Thebais; but the humour &s;oon &s;pread, and numbers under the name of hermits, or eremites, &s;ecluded them&s;elves from the commerce of mankind, chu&s;ing the wilde&s;t &s;olitudes, living in caves and hollows of the rocks, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch roots and herbs as the ground afforded them. About the fourth century, they were gathered into com|munities, and encrea&s;ed with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity. It was then that, by a great and &s;udden revolution, the fu|ry of per&s;ecution had cea&s;ed, and the governing powers were become friendly to chri&s;tianity. But the agitation of men's minds did not immediately &s;ub&s;ide with the &s;torm. The chri&s;tians had &s;o long experienced the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of re&s;igning all the enjoyments of life, and were &s;o detached from every tie which might interfere with the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith, that upon a more favourable turn of affairs they hardly dared open their minds to plea&s;urable emotions. They thought the life of a good man mu&s;t be a continual warfare between mind and body; and having been long u&s;ed to &s;ee ea&s;e and &s;afety on the one &s;ide, and virtue on the other, no wonder if the a&s;&s;ociation was &s;o &s;trong in their minds, as to &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of voluntary mortification, and lead them to inflict tho&s;e &s;ufferings upon them&s;elves, which they no longer apprehended from others. They had continu|ally experienced the amazing effects of chri&s;tianity in &s;upporting its followers under hard&s;hip, tortures, and death; and they thought little of its influence in regu|lating the behaviour of life, if it produced none of tho&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="55">
great exertions they had been u&s;ed to contemplate. They were &s;truck with the change from heathen licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s to the purity of the go&s;pel; and thought they could never be far enough removed from that bondage of the &s;en&s;es which it had ju&s;t co&s;t them &s;o violent a &s;truggle to e&s;cape. The minds of men were working with newly received opinions, not yet mellowed into a rational faith; and the young converts, a&s;toni&s;hed at the gran|deur and &s;ublimity of the doctrines which then fir&s;t en|tered their hearts with irre&s;i&s;table force, thought them worthy to engro&s;s their whole attention. The my&s;tic dreams of the Platoni&s;t mingled with the enthu&s;ia&s;in of the martyr; and it &s;oon became the prevailing opinion, that &s;ilence, &s;olitude, and contemplation were nece&s;&s;ary for the reception of divine truth. Mi&s;taken ideas pre|vailed of a purity and perfection far &s;uperiour to the rules of common life, which was only to be attained by tho&s;e who denied them&s;elves all the indulgences of &s;en&s;e: and thus the a&s;cetic &s;everities of the cloi&s;ter &s;uc|ceeded in &s;ome degree to the philo&s;ophic poverty of the Cynic &s;chool, and the lofty virtues of the Stoic porch.</P>
<P>INDEED, it is now the prevailing ta&s;te in morals to decry every ob&s;ervance which has the lea&s;t appearance of rigour; and to in&s;i&s;t only on the &s;ofter virtues. But let it be remembered, that &s;elf-command and &s;elf-denial are as nece&s;&s;ary to the practice of benevolence, charity, and compa&s;&s;ion, as to any other duty; that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to live to others without denying our&s;elves; and that the man who has not learned to curb his ap|petites and pa&s;&s;ions is ill qualified for tho&s;e &s;acrifices which the friendly affections are continually requiring of him. The man who has that one quality of &s;elf|command will find little difficulty in the practice of any other duty; as, on the contrary, he who has it not,
<PB N="53" REF="56">
tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the gentle&s;t feelings, and mo&s;t refined &s;en&s;ibilities, will &s;oon find his benevolence &s;ink into a mere companionable ea&s;ine&s;s of temper, neither u&s;eful to others nor happy for him&s;elf. A noble enthu&s;ia&s;m is &s;ometimes of u&s;e to &s;hew how far human nature can go. Though it may not be proper, or de&s;irable, that numbers &s;hould &s;eclude them&s;elves from the common duties and ordinary avocations of life, for the au&s;terer le&s;&s;ons of the cloi&s;ter, yet it is not unu&s;eful that &s;ome &s;hould pu&s;h their virtues to even a romantic height; and it is encouraging to reflect in the hour of tempta|tion that the love of ea&s;e, the aver&s;ion to pain, every appetite and pa&s;&s;ion, and even the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;i|ties in our nature, have been controuled; that the em|pire of the mind over the body has been a&s;&s;erted in its fulle&s;t extent; and that there have been men in all ages, who voluntarily renounce all the world offers, voluntarily &s;uffer all it dreads, and live independent, and unconnected with it. Nor was it a &s;mall advan|tage, or ill calculated to &s;upport the dignity of &s;cience, that a learned man might be re&s;pectable in a coar&s;e gown, a leathern girdle, and bare-footed. Cardinal Ximenes pre&s;erved the &s;evere &s;implicity of a convent a|mid&s;t the pomp and luxury of palaces; and to tho&s;e who thus thought it becoming in the highe&s;t &s;tations to affect the appearance of poverty, the reality &s;urely could not be very dreadful.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another light in which the&s;e in&s;titu|tions may be con&s;idered. It is, &s;urely, not improper to provide a retreat for tho&s;e, who &s;tained by &s;ome deep and enormous crime, wi&s;h to expiate by &s;evere and un|common penitence tho&s;e offences which render them unworthy of freer commerce with the world. Repen|tance is never &s;o &s;ecure from a relap&s;e as when it breaks
<PB N="54" REF="57">
off at once from every former connection, and entering upon a new cour&s;e of life, bids adieu to every object that might revive the idea of temptations which have once prevailed. In the&s;e &s;olemn retreats, the &s;tillne&s;s and acknowledged &s;anctity of the place, with the &s;trik|ing novelty of every thing around them, might have great influence in calming the pa&s;&s;ions; might break the force of habit, and &s;uddenly induce a new turn of thinking. There are likewi&s;e afflictions &s;o overwhelming to humanity, that they leave no reli&s;h in the mind for any thing el&s;e than to enjoy its own melancholy in &s;ilence and &s;olitude; and to a heart torn with remor&s;e, or op|pre&s;t with &s;orrow, the gloomy &s;everities of La Trappe are really a relief. Retirement is al&s;o the favourite wi&s;h of age. Many a &s;tate&s;man, and many a warriour, &s;ick of the bu&s;tle of that world to which they had de|voted the prime of their days, have longed for &s;ome quiet cell where, like cardinal Wol&s;ey or Charles V. they might &s;hroud their grey hairs, and lo&s;e &s;ight of the follies with which they had been too much tainted.</P>
<P>THOUGH there is, perhaps, le&s;s to plead for im|muring beauty in a cloi&s;ter, and confining that part of the &s;pecies who are formed to &s;hine in families and &s;weeten &s;ociety, to the barren duties and au&s;tere di&s;cip|line of a mona&s;tic life; yet, circum&s;tances might occur, in which they would, even to a woman, be a welcome refuge. A young female, whom accident, or war, had deprived of her natural protectors, mu&s;t, in an age of barbari&s;m, be peculiarly expo&s;ed and helple&s;s. A con|vent offered her an a&s;ylum where &s;he might be &s;afe, at lea&s;t, if not happy; and add to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of unvi|olated virtue the flattering dreams of angelic purity and perfection. There were orders, as well among&s;t the women, as the men, in&s;tituted for charitable pur|po&s;es,
<PB N="55" REF="58">
&s;uch as that of the <HI>Virgins of love,</HI> or <HI>Daughters of mercy,</HI> founded in 1660, for the relief of the &s;ick poor; with others for in&s;tructing their children. The&s;e mu&s;t have been peculiarly &s;uited to the &s;oftne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion of the &s;ex; and to this it is no doubt owing, that &s;till, in catholic countries, ladies of the highe&s;t rank often vi|&s;it the ho&s;pitals and hou&s;es of the poor; waiting on them with the mo&s;t tender a&s;&s;iduity, and performing &s;uch of|fices as our prote&s;tant ladies would be &s;hocked at the thoughts of. We &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider, that mo&s;t of the fe|males who now take the veil, are &s;uch as have no agree|able pro&s;pects in life. Why &s;hould not the&s;e be allow|ed to quit a world which will never mi&s;s them? It is ea&s;ier to retire from the public, than to &s;upport its di&s;re|gard. The convent is to them a &s;helter from poverty and neglect. Their little community grows dear to them. The equality which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among the&s;e &s;i&s;ters of ob&s;curity, the &s;imilarity of their fate, the peace, the lei&s;ure they enjoy, give ri&s;e to the mo&s;t endearing friend&s;hips. Their innocence is &s;hielded by the &s;impli|city of their life from even the idea of ill; and they are flattered by the notion of a voluntary renunciation of plea|&s;ures, which probably, had they continued in the world, they would have had little &s;hare in.</P>
<P>AFTER all that can be &s;aid, we have rea&s;on enough to rejoice that the &s;uper&s;titions of former times are now fallen into di&s;repute. What might be a palliative at one time, &s;oon became a crying evil in it&s;elf. When the ful|ler day of &s;cience began to dawn, the monki&s;h orders were willing to exclude its brightne&s;s, that the dim lamp might &s;till glimmer in their cell. Their growing vices have rendered them ju&s;tly odious to &s;ociety, and they &s;eem in a fair way of being for ever aboli&s;hed. But may we not &s;till hope that the world was better than it would have

<HEAD>ON THE PLEASURE DERIVED FROM OBJECTS OF TERROR; WITH SIR BERTRAND, A FRAGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the exerci&s;e of our benevolent feelings, as called forth by the view of human afflictions, &s;hould be a &s;ource of plea&s;ure, cannot appear wonder|ful to one who con&s;iders that relation between the moral and natural &s;y&s;tem of man, which has connected a degree of &s;atisfaction with every action or emotion productive of the general welfare. The painful &s;en&s;a|tion immediately ari&s;ing from a &s;cene of mi&s;ery, is &s;o much &s;oftened and alleviated by the reflex &s;en&s;e of &s;elf|approbation attending virtuous &s;ympathy, that we find, on the whole, a very exqui&s;ite and refined plea&s;ure re|maining, which makes us de&s;irous of again being wit|ne&s;&s;es to &s;uch &s;cenes, in&s;tead of flying from them with di&s;|gu&s;t and horror. It is obvious how greatly &s;uch a provi|&s;ion mu&s;t conduce to the ends of mutual &s;upport and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. But the apparent delight with which we dwell upon objects of pure terror, where our moral feelings are not in the lea&s;t concerned, and no pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to be excited but the depre&s;&s;ing one of fear, is a paradox of the heart, much more difficult of &s;olution.</P>
<P>THE reality of this &s;ource of plea&s;ure &s;eems evident from daily ob&s;ervation. The greedine&s;s with which the
<PB N="58" REF="61">
tales of gho&s;ts and goblins, of murders, earthquakes, fires, &s;hipwrecks, and all the mo&s;t terrible di&s;a&s;ters at|tending human life, are devoured by every ear, mu&s;t have been generally remarked. Tragedy, the mo&s;t favourite work of fiction, has taken a full &s;hare of tho&s;e &s;cenes; <Q REND="inline">"it has &s;upt full with horrors"</Q>&mdash;and has, per|haps, been more indebted to them for public admiration than to its tender and pathetic parts. The gho&s;t of Hamlet, Macbeth de&s;cending into the witches' cave, and the tent &s;cene in Richard, command as &s;orcibly the attention of our &s;ouls as the parting Jaffeir and Belvidera, the fall of Wol&s;ey, or the death of Shore. The in&s;pi|ration of <HI>terror</HI> was by the antient critics a&s;&s;igned as the peculiar province of tragedy; and the Greek and Ro|man tragedians have introduced &s;ome extraordinary per|&s;onages for this purpo&s;e: not only the &s;hades of the dead, but the &s;uries, and other fabulous inhabitants of the infernal regions. Collins, in his mo&s;t poetical ode to Fear, has finely enforced this idea.<Q><L>Tho' gentle Pity claim her mingled part,</L>
<L>Yet all the thunders of the &s;cene are thine.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE old Gothic romance and the Ea&s;tern tale, with their genii, giants, enchantments, and transformations, however a refined critic may cen&s;ure them as ab&s;urd and extravagant, will ever retain a mo&s;t powerful in|fluence on the mind, and intere&s;t the reader indepen|dently of all peculiarity of ta&s;te. Thus the great Mil|ton, who had a &s;trong bia&s;s to the&s;e wildne&s;&s;es of the imagination, has with &s;triking effect made the &s;tories <Q REND="inline">"of fore&s;ts and enchantments drear,"</Q> a favourite &s;ub|ject with his <HI>Pen&s;ero&s;o;</HI> and had undoubtedly their awakening images &s;trong upon his mind when he breaks out,<Q><PB N="59" REF="62">
<L>Call up him that left half-told</L>
<L>The &s;tory of Cambu&s;can bold; &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>How are we then to account for the plea&s;ure derived from &s;uch objects? I have often been led to imagine that there is a deception in the&s;e ca&s;es; and that the avidity with which we attend is not a proof of our re|ceiving real plea&s;ure. The pain of &s;u&s;pence, and the irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire of &s;atisfying curio&s;ity, when once rai&s;ed, will account for our eagerne&s;s to go quite through an adventure, though we &s;uffer actual pain during the whole cour&s;e of it. We rather chu&s;e to &s;uffer the &s;mart pang of a violent emotion than the unea&s;y craving of an un|&s;atisfied de&s;ire. That this principle, in many in&s;tances, may involuntarily carry us through what we di&s;like, I am convinced from experience. This is the impul&s;e which renders the poore&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;ipid narrative in|tere&s;ting when once we get fairly into it; and I have frequently felt it with regard to our modern novels, which, if lying on my table, and taken up in an idle hour, have led me through the mo&s;t tedious and di&s;|gu&s;ting pages, while, like Pi&s;tol eating his leek, I have &s;wallowed and execrated to the end. And it will not only force us through dullne&s;s, but through actual tor|ture&mdash;through the relation of a Damien's execution, or an inqui&s;itor's act of faith. When children, therefore, li&s;ten with pale and mute attention to the frightful &s;to|ries of apparitions, we are not, perhaps, to imagine that they are in a &s;tate of enjoyment, any more than the poor bird which is dropping into the mouth of the rattle|&s;nake&mdash;they are chained by the ears, and fa&s;cinated by curio&s;ity. This &s;olution, however, does not &s;atisfy me with re&s;pect to the well-wrought &s;cenes of artificial ter|ror which are formed by a &s;ublime and vigorous ima|gination.
<PB N="60" REF="63">
Here, though we know before-hand what to expect, we enter into them with eagerne&s;s, in que&s;t of a plea&s;ure already experienced. This is the plea&s;ure con&s;tantly attached to the excitement of &s;urpri&s;e from new and wonderful objects. A &s;trange and unexpect|ed event awakens the mind, and keeps it on the &s;tretch; and where the agency of invi&s;ible being is introduced, of <Q REND="inline">"forms un&s;een, and mightier far than we,"</Q> our ima|gination, darting forth, explores with rapture the new world which is laid open to its view, and rejoices in the expan&s;ion of its powers. Pa&s;&s;ion and fancy co-operat|ing elevate the &s;oul to its highe&s;t pitch; and the pain of terror is lo&s;t in amazement.</P>
<P>HENCE, the more wild, fanciful, and extraordinary are the circum&s;tances of a &s;cene of horror, the more plea&s;ure we receive from it; and where they are too near common nature, though violently borne by curio|&s;ity through the adventure, we cannot repeat it or re|flect on it, without an over-balance of pain. In the <HI>Arabian nights</HI> are many mo&s;t &s;triking examples of the terrible joined with the marvellous: the &s;tory of Alad|din and the travels of Sinbad are particularly excellent. The <HI>Ca&s;tle of Otranto</HI> is a very &s;pirited modern attempt upon the &s;ame plan of mixed terror, adapted to the model of Gothic romance. The be&s;t conceived, and mo&s;t &s;trongly worked-up &s;cene of mere natural horror that I recollect, is in Smollet's <HI>Ferdinand count Fathom;</HI> where the hero, entertained in a lone hou&s;e in a fore&s;t, finds a corp&s;e ju&s;t &s;laughtered in the room where he is &s;ent to &s;leep, and the door of which is locked upon him. It may be amu&s;ing for the reader to compare his feel|ings upon the&s;e, and from thence form his opinion of the ju&s;tne&s;s of my theory.

<P>&mdash;AFTER this adventure, Sir Bertrand turned his &s;teed towards the woulds, hoping to cro&s;s the&s;e dreary moors before the curfew. But ere he had pro|ceeded half his journey, he was bewildered by the dif|ferent tracks, and not being able, as far as the eye could reach, to e&s;py any object but the brown heath &s;urrounding him, he was at length quite uncertain which way he &s;hould direct his cour&s;e. Night over|took him in this &s;ituation. It was one of tho&s;e nights when the moon gives a faint glimmering of light through the thick black clouds of a lowering &s;ky. Now and then &s;he &s;uddenly emerged in full &s;plendor from her veil; and then in&s;tantly retired behind it, having ju&s;t &s;erved to give the forlorn Sir Bertrand a wide extended pro&s;pect over the de&s;olate wa&s;te. Hope and native courage a while urged him to pu&s;h forwards, but at length the increa&s;ing darkne&s;s and fatigue of body and mind overcame him; he dreaded moving from the ground the &s;tood on, for fear of unknown pits and bogs, and alighting from his hor&s;e in de&s;pair, he threw him|&s;elf on the ground. He had not long continued in that po&s;ture when the &s;ullen toll of a di&s;tant bell &s;truck his ears&mdash;he &s;tarted up, and turning towards the &s;ound di&s;cerned a dim twinkling light. In&s;tantly he &s;eized his hor&s;e's bridle, and with cautious &s;teps advanced towards it. After a painful march he was &s;topt by a moated ditch &s;urrounding the place from whence the light pro|ceeded; and by a momentary glimp&s;e of moon-light he
<PB N="62" REF="65">
had a full view of a large antique man&s;ion, with tur|rets at the corners, and an ample porch in the centre. The injuries of time were &s;trongly marked on every thing about it. The roof in various places was fallen in, the battlements were half demoli&s;hed, and the win|dows broken and di&s;mantled. A draw-bridge, with a ruinous gate-way at each end, led to the court before the building&mdash;He entered, and in&s;tantly the light, which proceeded from a window in one of the turrets, glided along and vani&s;hed; at the &s;ame moment the moon &s;unk beneath a black cloud, and the night was darker than ever. All was &s;ilent&mdash;Sir Bertrand fa&s;tened his &s;teed under a &s;hed, and approaching the hou&s;e traver&s;ed its whole front with light and &s;low foot&s;teps&mdash;All was &s;till as death&mdash;He looked in at the lower windows, but could not di&s;tingui&s;h a &s;ingle object through the impe|netrable gloom. After a &s;hort parley with him&s;elf, he entered the porch, and &s;eizing a ma&s;&s;ey iron knocker at the gate, lifted it up, and he&s;itating, at length &s;truck a loud &s;troke. The noi&s;e re&s;ounded through the whole man&s;ion with hollow echoes. All was &s;till again&mdash;He repeated the &s;trokes more boldly and louder&mdash;another interval of &s;ilence en&s;ued&mdash;A third time he knocked, and a third time all was &s;till. He then fell back to &s;ome di&s;tance that he might di&s;cern whether any light could be &s;een in the whole front&mdash;It again appeared in the &s;ame place and quickly glided away as before&mdash;at the &s;ame in&s;tant a deep &s;ullen toll &s;ounded from the turret. Sir Bertrand's heart made a fearful &s;top&mdash;He was a while motionle&s;s; then terror impelled him to make &s;ome ha&s;ty &s;teps towards his &s;teed&mdash;but &s;hame &s;topt his flight; and urged by honour, and a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of fini&s;hing the adventure, he returned to the porch; and working up his &s;oul to a full &s;teadine&s;s of
<PB N="63" REF="66">
re&s;olution, he drew forth his &s;word with one hand, and with the other lifted up the latch of the gate. The heavy door, creaking upon its hinges, reluctantly yielded to his hand&mdash;he applied his &s;houlder to it and forced it open&mdash;he quitted it and &s;tept forward&mdash;the door in|&s;tantly &s;hut with a thundering clap. Sir Bertrand's blood was chilled&mdash;he turned back to find the door, and it was long ere his trembling hands could &s;eize it&mdash;but his utmo&s;t &s;trength could not open it again. After &s;everal ineffectual attempts, he looked behind him, and beheld, acro&s;s a hall, upon a large &s;tairca&s;e, a pale blui&s;h flame which ca&s;t a di&s;mal gleam of light around. He again &s;ummoned forth his courage and advanced towards it&mdash;It retired. He came to the foot of the &s;tairs, and after a moment's deliberation a&s;cended. He went &s;lowly up, the flame retiring before him, till he came to a wide gallery&mdash;The flame proceeded along it, and he followed in &s;ilent horror, treading lightly, for the echoes of his foot&s;teps &s;tartled him. It led him to the foot of ano|ther &s;tairca&s;e, and then vani&s;hed&mdash;At the &s;ame in&s;tant another toll &s;ounded from the turret&mdash;Sir Bertrand felt it &s;trike upon his heart. He was now in total dark|ne&s;s, and with his arms extended, began to a&s;cend the &s;econd &s;tair-ca&s;e. A dead cold hand met his left hand and firmly gra&s;ped it, drawing him forcibly forwards&mdash;he endeavoured to di&s;engage him&s;elf, but could not&mdash;he made a furious blow with his &s;word, and in&s;tantly a loud &s;hriek pierced his ears, and the dead hand was left powerle&s;s in his&mdash;He dropt it, and ru&s;hed forwards with a de&s;perate valour. The &s;tairs were narrow and wind|ing, and interrupted by frequent breaches, and loo&s;e fragments of &s;tone. The &s;tair-ca&s;e grew narrower and narrower, and at length terminated in a low iron grate. Sir Bertrand pu&s;hed it open&mdash;it led to an intricate wind|ing

pa&s;&s;age, ju&s;t large enough to admit a per&s;on upon his hands and knees. A faint glimmering of light &s;erv|ed to &s;how the nature of the place. Sir Bertrand en|tered&mdash;A deep hollow groan re&s;ounded from a di&s;tance through the vault&mdash;He went forwards, and proceeding beyond the fir&s;t turning, he di&s;cerned the &s;ame blue flame which had before conducted him. He followed it. The vault, at length, &s;uddenly opened into a lofty gallery, in the mid&s;t of which a figure appeared, compleatly armed, thru&s;ting forwards the bloody &s;tump of an arm, with a terrible frown and menacing ge&s;ture, and bran|di&s;hing a &s;word in his hand. Sir Bertrand undauntedly &s;prung forwards; and aiming a fierce blow at the figure, it in&s;tantly vani&s;hed, letting fall a ma&s;&s;ey iron key. The flame now re&s;ted upon a pair of ample folding doors at the end of the gallery. Sir Bertrand went up to it, and applied the key to a brazen lock&mdash;with difficulty he turned the bolt&mdash;in&s;tantly the doors flew open, and di&s;|covered a large apartment, at the end of which was a coffin re&s;ted upon a bier, with a taper burning on each &s;ide of it. Along the room on both &s;ides were gigantic &s;tatues of black marble, attired in the Moori&s;h habit, and holding enormous &s;abres in their right hands. Each of them reared his arm, and advanced one leg forwards, as the knight entered; at the &s;ame moment the lid of the coffin flew open, and the bell tolled. The flame &s;till glided forwards, and Sir Bertrand re&s;olutely fol|lowed, till he arrived within &s;ix paces of the coffin. Suddenly, a lady in a &s;hrowd and black veil ro&s;e up in it, and &s;tretched out her arms towards him&mdash;at the &s;ame time the &s;tatues cla&s;hed their &s;abres and advanced. Sir Bertrand flew to the lady and cla&s;ped her in his arms&mdash;&s;he threw up her veil and ki&s;&s;ed his lips; and in&s;tantly the whole building &s;hook as with an earth|quake,
<PB N="65" REF="68">
and fell a&s;under with a horrible cra&s;h. Sir Ber|trand was thrown into a &s;udden trance, and on reco|vering, found him&s;elf &s;eated on a velvet &s;ofa, in the mo&s;t magnificent room he had ever &s;een, lighted with innumerable tapers, in lu&s;tres of pure cry&s;tal. A &s;ump|tuous banquet was &s;et in the middle. The doors open|ing to &s;oft mu&s;ic, a lady of incomparable beauty, at|tired with amazing &s;plendor entered, &s;urrounded by a troop of gay nymphs more fair than the Graces&mdash;She advanced to the knight, and falling on her knees thank|ed him as her deliverer. The nymphs placed a garland of laurel upon his head, and the lady led him by the hand to the banquet, and &s;at be&s;ide him. The nymphs placed them&s;elves at the table, and a numerous train of &s;ervants entering, &s;erved up the fea&s;t; delicious mu&s;ic playing all the time. Sir Bertrand could not &s;peak for a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;he could only return their honours by courteous looks and ge&s;tures.

<HEAD>ON THE HEROIC POEM OF GONDIBERT.</HEAD>
<P>A Per&s;on engaged in the pur&s;uit of literary fame mu&s;t be &s;everely mortified on ob&s;erving the very &s;peedy neglect into which writers of high merit &s;o fre|quently fall. The revolution of centuries, the extinc|tion of languages, the va&s;t convul&s;ions which agitate a whole people, are cau&s;es which may well be &s;ubmitted to in overwhelming an author with oblivion; but that in the &s;ame country, with little variation of language or manners, the delights of one age &s;hould become utter &s;trangers in the next, is &s;urely an immaturity of fate which conveys reproach upon the incon&s;tancy of nation|al ta&s;te. That noble band, the Engli&s;h Poets, have am|ple rea&s;on for complaining to what unju&s;t guardians they have entru&s;ted their renown. While we crown the &s;ta|tue of Shake&s;peare as the prince of dramatic poets, &s;hall we forget the works, and almo&s;t the names of his con|temporaries who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much of a kindred &s;pirit? Shall the Italian <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido</HI> and <HI>Amyntas</HI> &s;tand high in our e&s;timation, and the <HI>Faithful Shepherde&s;s,</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful pa&s;tcral that a poet's fancy ever formed, be &s;carcely known among&s;t us? Shall we feel the fire of heroic poetry in tran&s;lations from Greece and Rome, and never &s;earch for it in the native productions of our own country?</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">
THE capital work of <HI>Sir William D'avenant,</HI> which I now de&s;ire to call forth from its ob&s;curity, may well be con&s;idered as in a &s;tate of oblivion, &s;ince we no where meet with allu&s;ions to it, or quotations from it, in our modern writers; and few, I imagine, even of the pro|fe&s;&s;ed &s;tudents in Engli&s;h cla&s;&s;ics, would think their ta&s;te di&s;credited by confe&s;&s;ing that they had never read GONDIBERT. A very learned and ingenious critic, in his well-known <HI>di&s;cour&s;e upon poetical imitation,</HI> has, in|deed, taken notice of this poem; but though he be&s;tows all due prai&s;e upon its author, yet the purpo&s;e for which it is mentioned being to in&s;tance an e&s;&s;ential error, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that his authority has &s;erved to gain it more readers. Having very judiciou&s;ly laid it down as a general ob&s;ervation, that writers by &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid|ing the fancied di&s;grace of imitation are apt to fall into improper methods, forced conceits, and affected ex|pre&s;&s;ion; he proceeds to introduce the work in que&s;tion after the following manner. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And, that the reader may not &s;u&s;pect me of a&s;&s;erting this without experience, let me exemplify what has been here &s;aid in the ca&s;e of a very eminent per&s;on, who, with all the advantages of art and nature that could be required to adorn the true poet, was ruined by this &s;ingle error. The per|&s;on I mean was SIR WILLIAM D'AVENANT, who&s;e <HI>Gondibert</HI> will remain a perpetual monument of the mi&s;chiefs which mu&s;t ever ari&s;e from this affectation of originality in lettered and polite poets."</Q></P>
<P>A CONSIDERADLE degree of deference is undoubt|edly due to a critic of &s;uch acknowledged ta&s;te and abi|lities; yet, &s;ince it appears to me that in this in&s;tance he writes under the influence of &s;y&s;tem and learned pre|judice, I &s;hall venture to canva&s;s the principles upon which he &s;upports his cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">
THE <HI>method</HI> of Gondibert is fir&s;t objected to by Dr. Hurd, and upon two accounts. Fir&s;t, that the compa&s;s of the poem is contracted from the limits of the ancient epic, to tho&s;e of the dramatic form; and by this means, pur&s;uing a clo&s;e accelerated plot, the opportunity is lo&s;t of introducing digre&s;&s;ive ornaments, and of giving that minutene&s;s of de&s;cription which confers an air of reality. Now, &s;ince the author &s;ets out with di&s;avowing the com|mon rules of epic poetry, it is certainly unju&s;t to try him by tho&s;e rules. That effects are not produced which he never de&s;igned to produce can be no matter of blame; we have only to examine the ju&s;tne&s;s of the de&s;ign it&s;elf. It is wrong to expect incompatible qualities as well in compo&s;itions as in men. A work cannot at the &s;ame time po&s;&s;e&s;s force and diffu&s;ivene&s;s, rapidity and minute|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>EVERY one who has read Homer without prejudice, will, I doubt not, confe&s;s that the effects which &s;hould re&s;ult from the great events of the &s;tory are much bro|ken and impeded by that very minutene&s;s of de&s;cription, and frequency of digre&s;&s;ion which D'avenant is blamed for rejecting. The mind, warmed by an intere&s;ting narration, either in hi&s;tory, poetry, or romance, re|quires the writer to keep up with its exertions, and can|not bear him to flag in his pace, or turn a&s;ide in pur&s;uit of other objects. The proper end of epic poetry, ac|cording to Dr. Hurd, is <HI>admiration.</HI> This, I imagine, would by no means have been allowed by our author, who &s;eems rather to have placed it in intere&s;ting the pa&s;&s;ions, inclucating noble &s;entiments, and informing the under|&s;tanding. Nor does it an&s;wer the Idea of Horace, who prai&s;es Homer for his moral le&s;&s;ons, for teaching<Q>&mdash;quid &s;it pulcrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non.</Q> <PB N="69" REF="72">
However, a due limitation of &s;ubject, and &s;omething of rapidity in pur&s;uing it, appear very nece&s;&s;ary to the production of a con&s;iderable effect, of what kind &s;oever; and a pompous di&s;play of foreign circum&s;tances mu&s;t al|ways debilitate more than adorn. It appears an ex|tremely bad compliment to an epic poem, to &s;ay that its chief beauty lies in the epi&s;odes. Indeed epic poetry as exi&s;ting in the models of antiquity, or their copies, by no means, I think, de&s;erves the title given by cri|tics, of the highe&s;t &s;pecies of poetical compo&s;ition. The tedious compa&s;s of the &s;ubject, the nece&s;&s;ity of em|ploying &s;o large a &s;hare of the work in the relation of trifling occurrences for the &s;ake of connexion, and the frequency of interruptions from collateral matter, inevitably cau&s;e both the poet's exertions and the rea|der's attention to intermit; and it is no wonder that Homer and Virgil too &s;ometimes nod over their la|bours. The author of Gondibert &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e inconveniences, and upon fair com|pari&s;on of the epic and dramatic form, to have prefer|red the latter as capable of more &s;pirit, and uniform dignity. We &s;hall find, however, in reviewing the poem, that he has by no means re&s;tricted him&s;elf &s;o narrowly as to preclude all ornamental deviations; and though they may not de&s;erve the title of epi&s;odes, yet in his &s;hort and unfini&s;hed piece, they have all the de|&s;irable effect of a plea&s;ing variety.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd objection which Dr. Hurd brings a|gain&s;t the <HI>method</HI> of this poem, is the rejection of all &s;upernatural agency, or what con&s;titutes the <HI>machinery</HI> of the antient epic poem. But, for this, the critic him|&s;elf offers a vindication, when he commends the author for not running into the wild &s;ables of the Italian ro|mancers,
<PB N="70" REF="73">
<Q REND="inline">"which had too &s;lender a foundation in the &s;erious belief of his age to ju&s;tify a relation to them."</Q> Now by making this <HI>belief</HI> an e&s;&s;ential rule of propriety with re&s;pect to the machinery, an author in an enligh|tened period, &s;uch as that of D'avenant, is, in effect, prohibited from its u&s;e altogether; for the ab&s;tracted nature of a pure and philo&s;ophical religion renders it utterly unfit for the purpo&s;es of poetical fiction. The works of &s;uch Chri&s;tian poets as have attempted to form a &s;y&s;tem of machinery upon the ideas of &s;aints, angels, and tutelary &s;pirits, will &s;ufficiently prove that their religion, even with a mixture of popular &s;uper|&s;tition, was ill calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t their imagination. Two writers, whom one would little expect to meet upon the &s;ame ground, Sir Richard Blackmore and Mon&s;. Voltaire, have given in&s;tances of the &s;ame faul|ty plan in this re&s;pect; and nothing in the good Knight's epic labours can more de&s;erve the attack of ridicule, than the divine mi&s;&s;ion in the Henriade for in&s;tructing his Maje&s;ty in the &s;ublime my&s;teries of tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>IT was a very ju&s;t charge which Plato brought a|gain&s;t Homer, that he had greatly contributed to de|ba&s;e religion by the unworthy and ab&s;urd repre&s;enta|tions he has given of the cele&s;tial beings, both with re&s;pect to their power, and their ju&s;tice; and this is a fault which the poet mu&s;t always in &s;ome mea&s;ure be guilty of when he too familiarly mixes divine agen|cy with human events. Nor does it appear more fa|vourable to the greatne&s;s of the human per&s;onages that they are on all occa&s;ions &s;o beholden to the immediate interpo&s;ition of divine allies. The refined and judici|ous Virgil, though he has tolerably kept up the dignity
<PB N="71" REF="74">
of his Deities, has yet very much lowered his heroes from this cau&s;e. When we &s;ee Aeneas, the &s;on of a Godde&s;s, aided by a God, and covered with cele&s;tial armour, with difficulty vanqui&s;hing the gallant Turnus, we conclude that without &s;uch odds the victory mu&s;t have fallen on the other &s;ide. Under &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of &s;upernatural agency there was no other way of exalt|ing a man than making him, like Diomed, war again&s;t the Gods, or, like Cato, approve a cau&s;e which they had unju&s;tly condemned. Surely a <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;ober</HI> intermix|ture of religion"</Q> can never be attributed to the antient epic. The poem of Gondibert is, indeed, without all this mixture of religious machinery, whether it be termed &s;ober or extravagant. Human means are brought to accompli&s;h human ends; and Cowley, in his recommendatory lines prefixed to the work, has thus expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of this part of the plan.<Q><L>Methinks heroic poe&s;ie till now</L>
<L>Like &s;ome fanta&s;tique fairy-land did &s;how;</L>
<L>Gods, Devils, Nymphs, Witches, and Giant's race,</L>
<L>And all but man, in man's be&s;t work had place.</L>
<L>Thou, like &s;ome worthy Knight, with &s;acred arms</L>
<L>Do&s;t drive the Mon&s;ters thence, and end the charms:</L>
<L>In&s;tead of the&s;e do&s;t Men and Manners plant,</L>
<L>The things which that rich &s;oil did chiefly want.</L></Q></P>
<P>WE &s;hall &s;ee hereafter that the author has not ne|glected to introduce <HI>religious &s;entiment,</HI> and that of a more noble and elevated kind than can ea&s;ily be paral|lelled in poetry.</P>
<P>BUT as the Poet, in the Critic's opinion, did too much in bani&s;hing every thing &s;upernatural in the events, &s;o he did too little in retaining the fanta&s;tic notions of love and honour in the characters of his piece, which were
<PB N="72" REF="75">
derived from the &s;ame &s;ource of fiction and romance. There is, however, an e&s;&s;ential difference between the ca&s;es. Artificial &s;entiments, however unnatural at fir&s;t, may, from the operation of particular cau&s;es, become &s;o familiar as to be adopted into the manners of the age. In&s;tances of fa&s;hion in &s;entiment are almo&s;t as frequent as of fa&s;hion in dre&s;s. It is certain that the romantic ideas of love and honour did in fact prevail in a high degree during a con&s;iderable period of the later ages, owing to cau&s;es which the &s;ame ingenious critic has in a very curious manner inve&s;tigated, in his <HI>letters on Chivalry and Romance.</HI> They give the lead|ing tone to all poli&s;hed manners; and gallantry was as &s;erious a principle in the Italian courts, as love to their country in the &s;tates of Greece or old Rome. Su|pernatural agency in human events, on the other hand, however commonly pretended, or firmly believed, would never approach one &s;tep nearer to reality. After all, the author of Gondibert could not intend to reduce his poem to mere hi&s;tory; but he cho&s;e to take a poetical licence in the dignity and elevation of its &s;entiments, rather than in the marvellou&s;ne&s;s of its events. He thought he might attribute to the exalted per&s;onages of courts and camps the &s;ame noblene&s;s of mind which him&s;elf, a courtier and a &s;oldier, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If his work be allowed le&s;s grand and entertaining from the want of &s;uch ornaments as tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;ors are de|corated with, it will yet be difficult to &s;how how, at his time, they could have been applied con&s;i&s;tently with good &s;en&s;e and improved ta&s;te.</P>
<P>So much in vindication of the general <HI>method</HI> of Sir W. D'avenant's poem. With re&s;pect to its <HI>execution,</HI> the ju&s;tice of Dr. Hurd's cen&s;ure cannot be contro|verted. That his &s;entiments are frequently far-fetched
<PB N="73" REF="76">
and affected, and his expre&s;&s;ion, quaint and ob&s;cure, is but too obviou&s;ly apparent; and the&s;e faults, toge|ther with the want of harmony in ver&s;ification, will &s;ufficiently account for the neglect into which the work is fallen, though intere&s;ting in its &s;tory, and thick-&s;own with beauties. Readers who take up a book merely for the indolent amu&s;ement of a lei&s;ure hour, cannot endure the labour of unharbouring a fine thought from the cover of perplexed expre&s;&s;ion. The plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from a flowing line or a rounded period is more engag|ing to them, becau&s;e more ea&s;ily enjoyed, than that from a &s;ublime or witty conception. The author's faulty <HI>execution,</HI> however, aro&s;e from a &s;ource directly contrary to the <Q REND="inline">"dread of imitation."</Q> Imitation it&s;elf led him to it; for almo&s;t all the models of polite litera|ture exi&s;ting in his own country, and indeed in the o|ther poli&s;hed nations of Europe, were characterized by the very &s;ame vitiation of ta&s;te. Among our own wri|ters it is &s;ufficient to in&s;tance Donne, Suckling and Cowley for this con&s;tant affectation of wit and uncom|mon &s;entiment, and for a con&s;equent ob&s;curity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Yet all the&s;e, and Sir W. D'avenant, perhaps, in a more eminent degree than the re&s;t, had for great oc|ca&s;ions, above the temptation of trifling, a maje&s;tic and nervous &s;implicity both of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion; which, with our more refined ta&s;te and language, we have never been able to equal.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now hope that the reader would &s;et out with me upon a nearer in&s;pection of this peom, with the general idea of its being the work of an elevated genius, pregnant with a rich &s;tore of free and noble &s;entiment, fa&s;hioned by an intimate commerce with the great world, and boldly pur&s;uing an original, but not an un&s;kilful plan.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">
THE mea&s;ure cho&s;en for this poem is that which we now almo&s;t confine to elegy. This choice does not appear very judicious; for although our elegiac &s;tanza po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;trength and fullne&s;s which renders it not un&s;uitable to heroic &s;ubjects, yet in a piece of con&s;ider|able length, every returning mea&s;ure mu&s;t become tire|&s;ome from its frequent repetitions. And this is not the wor&s;t effect of returning flanzas, in a long work. The nece&s;&s;ity of comprizing a &s;entence within the limits of the mea&s;ure is the tyranny of Procru&s;tes to thought. For the &s;ake of a di&s;agreeable uniformity, expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t con&s;tantly be cramped or extenuated. In general the latter expedient will be practi&s;ed, as the ea&s;ie&s;t; and thus both &s;entiment and language will be enfeebled by unmeaning expletives. This, indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure is the effect of rhyme couplets; and &s;till more of the latin hexameter and pentameter. In our author, a re|dundancy of thought, running out into parenthe&s;es, &s;eems to have been produced, or at lea&s;t encouraged by the mea&s;ure. But I think he has generally pre&s;erved a force and maje&s;ty of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT would have been highly injudicious for one who has rejected all poetical machinery, to have begun his poem with the antient from of invoking a Mu&s;e. In|deed, in all modern writers this invocation appears little better than an unmeaning ceremony, practi&s;ed by rote from antient cu&s;tom; and very properly makes a part of the <HI>receipt for an epic poem</HI> humourou&s;ly laid down after the exact model of mechanical imitation, in the Specta|tor. Our author, with &s;imple and unaffected dignity, thus opens at once into his &s;ubject:<Q><L>Of all the Lombards, by their trophies known,</L>
<L>Who &s;ought fame &s;oon, and had her favour long,</L>

<P>DESCRIPTIONS of female beauty have engaged the powers of poets in every age, who have exhau&s;ted all nature for imagery to heighten their painting; yet the picture has ever been extremely faint and inadequate.

<P>Of the&s;e great rivals, Gondibert was he whom the king had de&s;tined for his &s;on-in-law, and the heir of his throne; and Rhodalind too, in the privacy of her own brea&s;t, had made the &s;ame choice.

<P>GONDIBERT, however, though of a nature by no means un&s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;&s;ion, had not as yet felt it for a particular object; and O&s;wald, who &s;tood forth as the public &s;uitor to the prince&s;s, was incited by no other motive than ambition. Not Rhodalind her&s;elf (&s;ays the Poet)<Q><PB N="78" REF="81">
Could he affect but &s;hining in her throne.</Q></P>
<P>HIS cau&s;e was powerfully pleaded with the prince&s;s by his &s;i&s;ter Gartha, with whom we are next brought acquainted. A bold, full, maje&s;tic beauty; and a cor|re&s;ponding mind, high, re&s;tle&s;s, and a&s;piring, are her di&s;tingui&s;hing features. The Prince and Duke were ur|ged on to ambitious pur&s;uits by their re&s;pective armies, which, ju&s;t returned from conque&s;t, lay encamped, the one at Bre&s;cia, and the other at Bergamo. That of Gondibert was compo&s;ed of hardy youth whom he had &s;elected from his father's camp, and educated in martial di&s;cipline under his own in&s;pection. Temperance, cha&s;ti|ty, vigilance, humanity, and all the high virtues of chival|ry remarkably di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e young &s;oldiers from tho&s;e of later times. Beauty, indeed, commanded no le&s;s regard among&s;t them than in a modern camp; but it was an object of pa&s;&s;ion, and not of appetite; and was the powerful engine in their education which in&s;pired them with noble and exalted &s;entiments. This is an idea on which our author, true to the principles of chivalry, ve|ry frequently enlarges, and always with peculiar force and dignity. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance it is thus finely ex|pre&s;&s;ed.<Q><LG>
<L>But tho' the Duke taught rigid di&s;cipline,</L>
<L>He let them beauty thus at di&s;tance know;</L>
<L>As prie&s;ts di&s;cover &s;ome more &s;acred &s;hrine,</L>
<L>Which none mu&s;t touch, yet all to it may bow.</L>

<L>When thus as &s;uitors mourning virgins pa&s;s</L>
<L>Thro' their clean camp, them&s;elves in form they draw,</L>

<P>THE &s;oldiers of O&s;wald were his father's brave vete|rans, in who&s;e arms he had been bred. The &s;tory thus opened, and our attention awakened to the expectation of important events, the fir&s;t canto is clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd canto introduces us to a &s;olemn annual hunting, held by Duke Gondibert in commemoration of a great victory gained on this day by his grand&s;ire. His train was adorned by many gallant and noble per&s;ons, the friends of his family, and commanders in his army. The hunting, which is de&s;cribed with much poetical &s;pirit, terminates in a combat. As Gondibert and his party are returning weary homeward, an ancient ranger ha&s;tily brings the tidings that O&s;wald, who had lain in ambu&s;h with a body of cho&s;en hor&s;e, is advancing up|on them. The Duke, rejecting all coun&s;els of flight, prepares to receive his foes; and with an account of their principal leaders, and the order of their march, the canto concludes.</P>
<P>A PARLEY between the chiefs now &s;ucceeds, in which the character of each is well pre&s;erved. O&s;wald warmly accu&s;es his rival for u&s;urping his claims on the prince&s;s and the kingdom. Gondibert defends him&s;elf with temper, and di&s;avows all ambitious de&s;igns. The other di&s;dains accommodation; and the conference ends in a generous agreement to decide their differences in &s;ingle fight.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="83">
WHEN every thing is prepared for the combat, Hu|bert, the brother of O&s;wald, &s;teps forth with a general challenge to the oppo&s;ite party. This is in&s;tantly ac|cepted, and &s;erves for a prelude to &s;o many others, that a general engagement &s;eems likely to en&s;ue; when O&s;wald reproves their di&s;obedient ardour: and, upon Hubert's in&s;i&s;ting to &s;hare his fate from the rights of bro|therhood, it is at length decided that three per&s;ons of each party &s;hould enter the li&s;ts along with their gene|rals. The duel then comes on, in the fourth canto; in which O&s;wald, Hubert, Paradine and Dargonet, are &s;everally matched with Gondibert: Hurgonil, the lover of Orna, the Duke's &s;i&s;ter; and Arnold and Hugo, ge|nerous rivals in Laura. De&s;criptions of battle are &s;o frequent in epic poetry that &s;carcely any circum&s;tances of variety are left to diver&s;ify them. Homer and his imitators have attempted novelty in the multiplicity of their combats by every po&s;&s;ible variation of wea|pon, po&s;ture, and wound. They con&s;idered the hu|man body with anatomical nicety; and dwelt with a &s;avage plea&s;ure upon every idea of pain and horror that &s;tudied butchery could excite. I &s;hall leave it to the profe&s;&s;ed admirers of antiquity to determine under what head of poetical beauty &s;uch objects are to be ranged. The terrible is certainly a principal &s;ource of the &s;ublime; but a &s;laughter-hou&s;e or a &s;urgery would not &s;eem proper &s;tudies for a poet. D'ave|nant has drawn little from them. His battles are rendered intere&s;ting chiefly by the character and &s;itu|ation of the combatants. When Arnold, the favour|ed lover of Laura, is &s;lain by Paradine, Hugo, who had overthrown his antagoni&s;t, &s;prings to avenge his rival, with the&s;e truly gallant expre&s;&s;ions.<Q><PB REF="84">

<P>HIS genero&s;ity, however, was fatal both to his foe and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HUBERT, di&s;abled by a wound in his arm, is di&s;ho|noured by receiving his life from his conqueror; upon which occa&s;ion the poet thus beautifully apo&s;trophi&s;es.<Q><L>O Honour, frail as life thy fellow flower!</L>

<P>THE death of the Prince at the &s;ame time takes off all re&s;traint from his party, and incites them to revenge. Led by the wounded Hubert, old Va&s;co, and Borgio, they attack the hunters, who, be&s;ides the fatigue of the chace, are repre&s;ented as &s;omewhat inferior in num|ber. A furious battle, the &s;ubject of the fifth canto, now en&s;ues. Gondibert &s;hines forth in all the &s;plendor of a hero. By his prowe&s;s his friends are re&s;cued, and
<PB REF="85">
the oppo&s;ite leaders overthrown in various &s;eparate en|counters; and by his military &s;kill the brave veterans of O&s;wald are defeated. The whole de&s;cription of the battle is warm and animated.</P>
<P>IN Gondibert's generous lamentation over the fallen, every heart mu&s;t &s;ympathize with the following pathetic tribute to the rival lovers.<Q><LG>
<L>Brave Arnold and his rival &s;traight remove,</L>
<L>Where Laura &s;hall be&s;trew their hallow'd ground;</L>
<L>Protectors both, and ornaments of love;</L>
<L>This &s;aid, his eyes out-wept his wide&s;t wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell her now the&s;e, love's faithful &s;aints, are gone</L>
<L>The beauty they ador'd &s;he ought to hide;</L>
<L>For vainly will love's miracles be &s;hown,</L>
<L>Since lover's faith with the&s;e brave rivals dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say little Hugo never more &s;hall mourn</L>
<L>In noble numbers her unkind di&s;dain;</L>
<L>Who now, not &s;eeing beauty, feels no &s;corn;</L>
<L>And wanting plea&s;ure, is exempt from pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When &s;he with flowers Lord Arnold's grave &s;hall &s;trew,</L>
<L>And hears why Hugo's life was thrown away,</L>
<L>She on that rival's hear&s;e will drop a few,</L>
<L>Which merits all that April gives to May.</L>

<P>THE Duke now draws off his remaining friends to|wards Bergamo: but on the journey, overcome by fa|tigue and lo&s;s of blood, he falls into a deadly &s;woon. His attendants, amid&s;t their anxiety and confu&s;ion upon this event, are &s;urpri&s;ed, in the &s;ixth canto, with the approach of a &s;quadron of hor&s;e. This, however proves to be a friendly body, led by old Ul&s;in; who, after recovering the Duke by a cordial, declares him&s;elf to have been a page to his grand&s;ire, and gives a noble re|lation of the character and exploits of his great ma&s;ter.
<PB N="83" REF="86">
The rumour of O&s;wald's attack brought him to the re|lief of Gondibert; and we have a de&s;cription, which will be thought too much bordering upon the ludicrous, of the &s;trange confu&s;ion among his maimed veterans, who in their ha&s;te had &s;eized upon each others artificial limbs. This un&s;ightly troop, with the deficiences of hands, arms, legs, and eyes, can &s;carcely, with all the poet's art, be rendered a re&s;pectable object. Such in|&s;tances of faulty judgment are frequent in the writings of an age which was characterized by vigour of imagi|nation rather than correctne&s;s of ta&s;te. Ulfin leads the Duke to the hou&s;e of the &s;age A&s;tragon, where with the approach of night, the canto and the fir&s;t book con|clude.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the &s;econd book, the poet car|ries us with Hurgonil and Tybalt and their noble dead, to Verona. The di&s;tant turrets fir&s;t appearing, and then the great objects opening, one by one; the river, the palace, the temple, and the amphitheatre of Flaminius, form a land&s;cape truly noble and picture&s;que. The view of the temple gives occa&s;ion to one of tho&s;e eleva|ted religious &s;entiments which dignify this poem.<Q><L>This to &s;oothe heaven the bloody Clephes built;</L>
<L>As if heaven's king &s;o &s;oft and ea&s;y were,</L>
<L>So meanly hous'd in heaven, and kind to guilt,</L>
<L>That he would be a tyrant's tenant here.</L></Q></P>
<P>WE have then a lively de&s;cription of a city mourning; with the various and uncertain rumours of the late event, among the people. The re&s;t of the canto is employed in a debate, rather tedious, though intermixed with fine &s;entiments, concerning the propriety of granting funeral rites to tho&s;e who had peri&s;hed in the quarrel.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="87">
THE progre&s;s of the fatal news is traced in the next canto. Aribert appears &s;itting in council in all the regal dignity. Tybalt relates the &s;tory. The king in a ma|je&s;tic &s;peech complains of the toils and cares of empire, and predicts the baneful con&s;equences likely to en&s;ue. A more intere&s;ting &s;cene is then di&s;clo&s;ed, in which Ty|balt declares the melancholy events of the combat to Rhodalind and the other ladies of the court. Great art is &s;hown in the delicate ambiguity by which they are prepared to receive the tidings. Laura is overpowered by her lo&s;s; and calling on Arnold's name, is conveyed away by her female attendants. This tender &s;cene of &s;orrow is finely contra&s;ted by the abrupt entrance of Gar|tha, in all the wild pomp of mingled rage and grief.<Q><LG>
<L>No &s;ooner was the pity'd Laura gone,</L>
<L>But O&s;wald's &s;i&s;ter, Gartha the renown'd,</L>
<L>Enters as if the world was overthrown,</L>
<L>Or in the tears of the afflicted drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unconquer'd as her beauty was her mind,</L>
<L>Which wanted not a &s;park of O&s;wald's fire;</L>
<L>Ambition lov'd but ne'er to love was kind;</L>
<L>Vex'd thrones did more than quiet &s;hades de&s;ire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her garments now in loo&s;e neglect &s;he wore,</L>
<L>As &s;uited to her wild di&s;hevell'd hair.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>IN the fury of her pa&s;&s;ion &s;he breaks out into execra|tions again&s;t the innocent.<Q><L>Bla&s;ted be all your beauties, Rhodalind!</L>
<L>Till you a &s;hame and terror be to &s;ight;</L>
<L>Unwing'd be Love, and &s;low as he is blind.</L>
<L>Who with your looks poi&s;on'd my brother's &s;ight!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="88">
AT length &s;he mounts her chariot, and flies with the wings of revenge to the veteran camp at Bre&s;cia. The terror impre&s;&s;ed on the people by her ha&s;ty departure is imaged with great &s;ublimity.<Q><L>She &s;eem'd their city's Genius as &s;he pa&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Who, by their &s;ins expell'd would ne'er return.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE third canto brings us to Bre&s;cia, where Hubert's arrival with the dead body of O&s;wald excites every emo|tion of &s;urprize, grief and fury in the brea&s;ts of the brave veterans. They &s;pend the night in this &s;torm of contending pa&s;&s;ions; and at day-break a&s;&s;emble round the tent of Hubert, who by a noble harangue gives ad|ditional fire to their revenge. They in&s;tantly arm, and demand to be led to Bergamo; when Gartha arrives. She turns their vengeance again&s;t the court, where &s;he repre&s;ents the triumph of Gondibert's faction, and the di&s;honour ca&s;t upon their own. The rage di&s;covered in her countenance, overpowering the &s;ymptoms of grief, is painted with amazing grandeur in the following &s;i|mile:<Q><L>The Sun did thus to threat'ned nature &s;how</L>
<L>His anger red, whil&s;t guilt look'd pale in all,</L>
<L>When clouds of floods did hang about his brow;</L>
<L>And then &s;hrunk back to let that anger fall.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS tempe&s;t is, however, allayed in the next canto by the arrival of the wife Hermegild; who, though grown aged in war and politics, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a youth|ful pa&s;&s;ion for Gartha. He &s;olemnly binds his &s;ervices to their party, for the reward of Gartha's love; but per&s;uades them to &s;ubmit to more cautious and pacific
<PB N="86" REF="89">
mea&s;ures. Gartha returns with him to the court; and the funeral of O&s;wald with Roman rites, <Q REND="inline">"Which yet the world's la&s;t law had not forbid,"</Q> is de&s;cribed in the remaining part of the canto.</P>
<P>FROM &s;cenes of rage and tumult the poet then leads us to the quiet &s;hades of philo&s;ophy in the hou&s;e of A|&s;tragon. This change is not better calculated for the reader's relief, than for a di&s;play of the richne&s;s and e|levation of the writer's mind. That the friend of Hobbes &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the learned lumber of the &s;chools will not be thought extraordinary; but that he &s;hould di&s;tinctly mark out &s;uch plans of acquiring knowledge as have &s;ince been pur&s;ued with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, may well be deemed a remarkable proof of high and comprehen&s;ive genius. In A&s;tragon's domain is a retired building, upon which is written in large letters, GREAT NATURE'S OFFICE. Here &s;it certain venerable &s;ages, &s;tiled <HI>Na|ture's Regi&s;ters,</HI> bu&s;ied in recording what is brought them by a throng called their <HI>Intelligencers.</HI> The&s;e men are diver&s;ly employed in exploring the haunts of bea&s;ts, of birds, and of fi&s;hes, and collecting ob&s;ervations of their manners, their prey, their increa&s;e, and every cir|cum&s;tance of their oeconomy. Near this place is NA|TURE'S NURSERY, &s;tocked with every &s;pecies of plants, of which the &s;everal properties and virtues are diligently examined. Is it not &s;triking to find in the <HI>hou&s;e of A&s;tragon</HI> &s;o exact a model of the <HI>&s;chool of Linnaeus?</HI></P>
<P>WE are next led to the CABINET OF DEATH; a receptacle for &s;keletons and anatomical curio&s;ities of e|very kind: and from thence, by a plea&s;ing analogy, to the library, or, as it is termed, the MONUMENT OF BANISH'D MINDS. THE feelings of his gue&s;ts on entering this room are thus de&s;cribed;<Q><PB N="87" REF="90">
<L>Where, when they thought they &s;aw in well &s;ought books</L>
<L>Th' a&s;&s;embled &s;ouls of all that men held wi&s;e,</L>
<L>It bred &s;uch awful rev'rence in their looks</L>
<L>As if they &s;aw the bury'd writers ri&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE poet then goes through a particular &s;urvey of the authors, di&s;tingui&s;hed into their &s;everal periods, countries, and profe&s;&s;ions; in which he exhibits a great extent of learning, and, much more to his honour, a &s;ound and liberal judgment of what is truly valuable in learning. Of this, his account of the polemic divines will be thought no unfavourable &s;pecimen.<Q><LG>
<L>About this &s;acred little book did &s;tand</L>
<L>Unwieldy volumes and in number great;</L>
<L>And long it was &s;ince any reader's hand</L>
<L>Had reach'd them from their unfrequented &s;eat.</L>

<LG>
<L>For a deep du&s;t (which time does &s;oftly &s;hed,</L>
<L>Where only time does come) their covers bear;</L>
<L>On which grave &s;piders &s;treets of webs had &s;pread,</L>
<L>Subtle, and &s;light, as the grave writers were.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the&s;e heaven's holy fire does vainly burn,</L>
<L>Nor warms, nor lights, but is in &s;parkles &s;pent;</L>
<L>Where froward authors with di&s;putes have torn</L>
<L>The garment &s;eamle&s;s as the firmament.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>IF the &s;ubjects of this canto appear more noble and elevated than tho&s;e which u&s;ually employ the epi&s;odes of heroic poetry, that of the en&s;uing one mu&s;t &s;trike with &s;till &s;uperior dignity. Having acquainted us with the philo&s;ophy of his admired &s;age, the poet now, by a beau|tiful kind of allegory, in&s;tructs us in his religion. A|&s;tragon had dedicated three temples, to PRAYER, to PENITENCE, and to PRAISE. The <HI>temple of Prayer</HI> is de&s;cribed as a building quite plain, open, and with|out
<PB N="88" REF="91">
bells; &s;ince nothing &s;hould tempt or &s;ummon to an office to which our own wants invite us. The duty of <HI>Penitence</HI> being a &s;everity unplea&s;ing to nature, its <HI>temple</HI> is contrived, by its &s;olemn and uncommon appearance, to catch the &s;en&s;e. It is a va&s;t building of black mar|ble, hung with black, and furni&s;hed with that <Q REND="inline">"dim religious light"</Q> which poets have &s;o finely employed to excite kindred ideas of gloom and melancholy: but none, I think, have painted it with &s;uch &s;trength of co|louring as our author:<Q><L>Black curtains hide the gla&s;s; whil&s;t from on high</L>
<L>A winking lamp &s;till threatens all the room,</L>
<L>As if the lazy flame ju&s;t now would die:</L>
<L>Such will the &s;un's la&s;t light appear at doom.</L></Q></P>
<P>A tolling bell calls to the temple; and every other circum&s;tance belonging to it is imagined with great pro|priety and beauty.</P>
<P>BUT the poet's greate&s;t exertions are re&s;erved for his favourite <HI>temple of Prai&s;e.</HI> A general &s;hout of joy is the &s;ummons to it. The building in its materials and archi|tecture is gay and &s;plendid beyond the mo&s;t &s;umptuous palace. The front is adorned with figures of all kinds of mu&s;ical in&s;truments; all, as he mo&s;t beautifully ex|pre&s;&s;es it,<Q><L>That joy did e'er invent, or breath in&s;pir'd,</L>
<L>Or flying fingers touch'd into a voice.</L></Q> The &s;tatues without, the pictures within, the decorations, and the choir of wor&s;hippers, are all &s;uited with nice judgment, and de&s;cribed with genuine poetry. This di&s;tingui&s;hed canto concludes with the&s;e noble &s;tanzas, the &s;um and moral, as it were, of the whole.<Q><PB N="89" REF="92"><LG>
<L>Prai&s;e is devotion fit for mighty minds;</L>

BUT I check my de&s;ire of copying more from this exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing picture. My intention is to excite curio&s;ity, not to gratify it.

<P>THAT the unpracti&s;ed Birtha &s;hould entertain an unre&s;i&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion for the noble&s;t of his &s;ex; and that Gondibert, who&s;e want of ambition alone had &s;ecured him from the charms of Rhodalind, &s;hould bow to tho&s;e of his lovely ho&s;te&s;s and handmaid, will be thought a very natural turn in the &s;tory; upon which, how|ever, the reader may fore&s;ee the mo&s;t intere&s;ting e|vents depending. The progre&s;s of their love, though &s;carcely known to them&s;elves, is &s;oon di&s;covered by the &s;age A&s;tragon. This is expre&s;&s;ed by the poet with a very fine turn of a common thought.<Q><L>When all the&s;e &s;ymptoms he ob&s;erved, he knows</L>

<P>THE remainder of this poem, con&s;i&s;ting of a third book written during the author's impri&s;onment, is com|po&s;ed of &s;everal detached &s;cenes, in which the main plot lies ripening for future action. Rivals are rai&s;ed in Birtha. Flattering advances from the court, and more open declarations of love from Rhodalind, are in vain employed to a&s;&s;ail the con&s;tancy of Gondibert. Various conflicts of pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;e, and intere&s;ting &s;ituations, well imagined and painted in lively colours. Much is given, as in the former parts, to the introduction of elevated &s;en|timent; with one example of which I &s;hall fini&s;h my quo|tations.

<P>THE plot is at length involved in &s;o many intricate and apparently un&s;urmountable difficulties, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;atisfactory termination.

<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THOSE KINDS OF DISTRESS WHICH EXCITE AGREEABLE SENSATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is undoubtedly true, though a phaenomenon of the human mind difficult to account for, that the repre&s;en|tation of di&s;tre&s;s frequently gives plea&s;ure; from which general ob&s;ervation many of our modern writers of tra|gedy and romance &s;eem to have drawn this inference, that in order to plea&s;e they have nothing more to do than to paint di&s;tre&s;s in natural and &s;triking colours. With this view, they heap together all the afflicting e|vents and di&s;mal accidents their imagination can fur|ni&s;h; and when they have half broke the reader's heart, they expect he &s;hould thank them for his agree|able entertainment. An author of this cla&s;s &s;its down, pretty much like an inqui&s;itor, to compute how much &s;uffering he can inflict upon the hero of his tale before he makes an end of him: with this difference, indeed, that the inqui&s;itor only tortures tho&s;e who are at lea&s;t reputed criminals; whereas the writer generally choo&s;es the mo&s;t excellent character in his piece for the &s;ubject of his per&s;ecution. The great criterion of excellence
<PB N="94" REF="97">
is placed in being able to draw tears plentifully; and concluding we &s;hall weep the more, the more the picture is loaded with doleful events, they go on tell|ing<Q><L>&mdash;of &s;orrows upon &s;orrows</L>
<L>Even to a lamentable length of woe.</L></Q></P>
<P>A MONARCH once propo&s;ed a reward for the di&s;co|very of a new plea&s;ure; but if any one could find out a new torture, or non-de&s;cript calamity, he would be more entitled to the applau&s;e of tho&s;e who fabricate books of entertainment.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;prings of pity require to be touched with a more delicate hand; and it is far from being true that we are agreeably affected by every thing that ex|cites our &s;ympathy. It &s;hall therefore be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this E&s;&s;ay to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e kinds of di&s;tre&s;s which are plea&s;ing in the repre&s;entation, from tho&s;e which are really painful and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>THE view or relation of mere mi&s;ery can never be plea&s;ing. We have, indeed, a &s;trong &s;ympathy with all kinds of mi&s;ery; but it is a feeling of pure unmix|ed pain, &s;imilar in kind, though not equal in degree to what we feel for our&s;elves on the like occa&s;ions; and never produces that melting &s;orrow, that thrill of ten|derne&s;s, to which we give the name of pity. They are two di&s;tinct &s;en&s;ations, marked by very different exter|nal expre&s;&s;ion. One cau&s;es the nerves to &s;ingle, the fle&s;h to &s;hudder, and the whole countenance to be thrown into &s;trong contractions; the other relaxes the frame, opens the features, and produces tears.

different emotions from the tender &s;entiment we feel for the dog of Uly&s;&s;es, who crawled to meet his long lo&s;t ma&s;ter, looked up, and died at his feet. Extreme bo|dily pain is perhaps the mo&s;t inten&s;e &s;uffering we are capable of, and if the fellow-feeling with mi&s;ery alone was grateful to the mind, the exhibition of a man in a fit of the tooth-ach, or under a chirurgical operation, would have a fine effect in a tragedy. But there mu&s;t be &s;ome other &s;entiment combined with this kind of in|&s;tinctive &s;ympathy, before it becomes in any degree plea|&s;ing, or produces the &s;weet emotion of pity. This &s;entiment is love, e&s;teem, the complacency we take in the contemplation of beauty, of mental or moral excel|lence, called forth and rendered more intere&s;ting, by circum&s;tances of pain and danger. Tenderne&s;s is, much more properly than &s;orrow, the &s;pring of tears; for it affects us in that manner whether combined with joy or grief; perhaps more in the former ca&s;e than the lat|ter. And I believe we may venture to a&s;&s;ert that no di&s;tre&s;s which produces tears is wholly without a mix|ture of plea&s;ure. When Jo&s;eph's brethren were &s;ent to buy corn, if they had peri&s;hed in the de&s;art by wild bea&s;ts, or been reduced (as in the horrid adventures of a Pierre de Vaud) to eat one another, we might have &s;hudder|ed, but we &s;hould not have wept for them. The gu&s;h of tears is when Jo&s;eph made him&s;elf known to his bre|thren, and fell on their neck, and ki&s;&s;ed them. When Hubert prepares to burn out prince Arthur's eyes, the &s;hocking circum&s;tance, of it&s;elf, would only affect us with horror; it is the amiable &s;implicity of the young prince, and his innocent affection to his intended mur|derer that draws our tears, and excites that tender &s;or|row which we love to feel, and which refines the heart while we do feel it.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="99">
WE &s;ee, therefore, from this view of our internal feelings, that no &s;cenes of mi&s;ery ought to be exhibit|ed which are not connected with the di&s;play of &s;ome moral excellence or agreeable quality. If fortitude, power, and &s;trength of mind are called forth, they pro|duce the &s;ublime feelings of wonder and admiration: if the &s;ofter qualities of gentlene&s;s, grace, and beauty, they in&s;pire love and pity. The management of the&s;e latter emotions is our pre&s;ent object.</P>
<P>AND let it be remembered, in the fir&s;t place, that the misfortunes which excite pity mu&s;t not be too hor|rid and overwhelming. The mind is rather &s;tunned than &s;oftened by great calamities. They are little cir|cum&s;tances that work mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly upon the tender feelings. For this rea&s;on, a well written novel gene|rally draws more tears than a tragedy. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tragedy are more calculated to amaze and terrify, than to move compa&s;&s;ion. Battles, torture and death are in every page. The dignity of the characters, the importance of the events, the pomp of ver&s;e and ima|gery intere&s;t the grander pa&s;&s;ions, and rai&s;e the mind to an enthu&s;ia&s;m little favourable to the weak and lan|guid notes of pity. The tragedies of Young are in a fine &s;train of poetry, and the &s;ituations are worked up with great energy, but the pictures are in too deep a &s;hade: all his pieces are full of violent and gloomy pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;o over-wrought with horror, that in&s;tead of awakening any plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility, they leave on the mind an impre&s;&s;ion of &s;adne&s;s mixed with terror. Shake|&s;pear is &s;ometimes guilty of pre&s;enting &s;cenes too &s;hock|ing. Such is the trampling out of Glo&s;ter's eyes; and &s;uch is the whole play of Titus Andronicus. But Lee, beyond all others, abounds with this kind of images. He delighted in painting the mo&s;t daring crimes, and
<PB N="97" REF="100">
cruel ma&s;&s;acres; and though he has &s;hewn him&s;elf ex|tremely capable of rai&s;ing tenderne&s;s, he continually checks its cour&s;e by &s;hocking and di&s;agreeable expre&s;&s;i|ons. His pieces are in the &s;ame ta&s;te with the pictures of Spagnolet, and there are many &s;cenes in his trage|dies which no one can reli&s;h who would not look with plea&s;ure on the flaying of St. Bartholomew. The fol|lowing &s;peech of Marguerit&eacute;, in the maffacre of Paris, was, I &s;uppo&s;e, intended to expre&s;s the utmo&s;t tender|ne&s;s of affection.<Q><L>Die for him! that's too little; I could burn</L>
<L>Piece-meal away, or bleed to death by drops,</L>
<L>Be flay'd alive, then broke upon the wheel,</L>
<L>Yet with a &s;mile endure it all for Gui&s;e:</L>
<L>And when let loo&s;e from torments, all one wound,</L>
<L>Run with my mangled arms, and cru&s;h him dead.</L></Q></P>
<P>IMAGLS like the&s;e will never excite the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;i|ons. We are le&s;s moved at the de&s;cription of an Indian tortured with all the dreadful ingenuity of that &s;avage people, than with the fatal mi&s;take of the lover in the Spectator, who pierced an artery in the arm of his mi&s;|tre&s;s as he was letting her blood. Tragedy and ro|mance-writers are likewi&s;e apt to make too free with the more violent expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, by which means they lo&s;e their effect. Thus an ordinary author does not know how to expre&s;s any &s;trong emotion otherwi&s;e than by &s;woonings or death; &s;o that a per&s;on experienced in this kind of reading, when a girl faints away at parting with her lover, or a hero kills him|&s;elf for the lo&s;s of his mi&s;tre&s;s, con&s;iders it as the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed etiquette upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, and turns over the pages with the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s and unconcern; whereas real &s;en&s;ibility and a more intimate knowledge of human
<PB N="98" REF="101">
nature would have &s;ugge&s;ted a thou&s;and little touches of grief, which though &s;light are irre&s;i&s;tible. We are to gloomy a people. Some of the French novels are re|markable for little affecting incidents, imagined with delicacy and told with grace. Perhaps they have a better turn than we for this kind of writing.</P>
<P>A JUDICIUS author will never attempt to rai&s;e pity by any thing mean or di&s;gu&s;ting. As we have already ob&s;erved, there mu&s;t be a degree of complacence mix|ed with our &s;orrows to produce an agreeable &s;ympathy; nothing, therefore, mu&s;t be admitted which de&s;troys the grace and dignity of &s;uffering; the imagination mu&s;t have an amiable figure to dwell upon; there are cir|cum&s;tances &s;o ludicrous or di&s;gu&s;ting, that no character can pre&s;erve a proper decorum under them, or appear in an agreeable light. Who can read the following de|&s;cription of Polypheme without finding his compa&s;&s;ion entirely de&s;troyed by aver&s;ion and loathing?<Q><L>&mdash;His bloody hand</L>
<L>Snatch'd two unhappy of my martial band,</L>
<L>And da&s;h'd like dogs again&s;t the &s;tony floor,</L>
<L>The pavement &s;wims with brains and mingled gore;</L>
<L>Torn limb from limb he &s;preads his horrid fea&s;t,</L>
<L>And fierce devours it like a mountain bea&s;t,</L>
<L>He &s;ucks the marrow and the blood he drains,</L>
<L>Nor entrails, fle&s;h, nor &s;olid bone remains.</L></Q> Or that of Scylla,<Q><L>In the wide dungeon &s;he devours her food,</L>
<L>And the fle&s;h trembles while &s;he churns the blood.</L></Q> Deformity is always di&s;gu&s;ting, and the imagination cannot reconcile it with the idea of a favourite cha|racter;
<PB N="99" REF="102">
therefore the poet and romance-writer are fully ju&s;tified in giving a larger &s;hare of beauty to their prin|cipal figures than is u&s;ually met with in common life. A late genius indeed, in a whim&s;ical mood, gave us a lady with her no&s;e cru&s;hed for the heroine of his &s;to|ry; but the circum&s;tance &s;poils the picture; and though in the cour&s;e of the &s;tory it is kept a good deal out of &s;ight, whenever it does recur to the imagination we are hurt and di&s;gu&s;ted. It was an heroic in&s;tance of virtue in the nuns of a certain abbey, who cut off their no&s;es and lips to avoid violation; yet this would make a very bad &s;ubject for a poem or a play. Something akin to this is the repre&s;entation of any thing unnatu|ral; of which kind is the famous &s;tory of the Roman charity, and for this rea&s;on I cannot but think it an un|plea&s;ing &s;ubject for either the pen or the pencil.</P>
<P>POVERTY, if truly repre&s;ented, &s;hocks our nicer feelings; therefore whenever it is made u&s;e of to a|waken our compa&s;&s;ion, the rags and dirt, the &s;qualid appearance and mean employments incident to that &s;tate mu&s;t be kept out of &s;ight, and the di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e from the idea of depre&s;&s;ion, and the &s;hock of falling from higher fortunes. We do not pity Beli&s;arius as a poor blind Beggar; and a painter would &s;ucceed very ill who &s;hould &s;ink him to the meanne&s;s of that con|dition. He mu&s;t let us &s;till di&s;cover the conqueror of the Vandals, the general of the imperial armies, or we &s;hall be little intere&s;ted. Let us look at the picture of the old woman in Otway;<Q><L>&mdash;A wrinkled hag with age grown double,</L>
<L>Picking dry &s;ticks, and muttering to her&s;elf;</L>
<L>Her eyes with &s;calding rheum were gall'd and red;</L>
<L>Cold pal&s;ie &s;hook her head; her hands &s;eem'd wither'd;</L>
<L><PB N="100" REF="103">
And on her crooked &s;houlder had &s;he wrapt</L>
<L>The tatter'd remnant of an old &s;trip'd hanging,</L>
<L>Which &s;erv'd to keep her carca&s;e from the cold;</L>
<L>So there was nothing of a piece about her.</L></Q> Here is the extreme of wretchedne&s;s, and in&s;tead of melting into pity we turn away with aver&s;ion. Indeed the author only intended it to &s;trike horror. But how different are the &s;entiments we feel for the lovely Bel|videra! We &s;ee none of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which ren|der poverty an unamiable thing. When the goods are &s;eized by an execution, our attention is turned to <HI>the piles of ma&s;&s;y plate, and all the antient mo&s;t dome&s;tic orna|ments,</HI> which imply grandeur and con&s;equence; or to &s;uch in&s;tances of their hard fortune as will lead us to pity them as lovers: we are &s;truck and affected with the general face of ruin, but we are not brought near enough to di&s;cern the ugline&s;s of its features. Belvi|dera ruined, Belvidera deprived of friends, without a home, abandoned to the wide world&mdash;we can contem|plate with all the plea&s;ing &s;ympathy of pity; but had &s;he been repre&s;ented as really &s;unk into low life, had we &s;een her employed in the mo&s;t &s;ervile offices of po|verty, our compa&s;&s;ion would have given way to con|tempt and di&s;gu&s;t. Indeed, we may ob&s;erve in real life that poverty is only pitied &s;o long as people can keep them&s;elves from the effects of it. When in com|mon language we &s;ay <HI>a mi&s;erable object,</HI> we mean an object of di&s;tre&s;s which, if we relieve, we turn away from at the &s;ame time. To make pity plea&s;ing, the object of it mu&s;t not in any view be di&s;agreeable to the imagination. How admirably has the author of Clari&s;&s;a managed this point? Amid&s;t &s;cenes of &s;uffer|ing
<PB N="101" REF="104">
which rend the heart, in poverty, in a pri&s;on, un|der the mo&s;t &s;hocking outrages, the grace and delica|cy of her character never &s;uffers even for a moment: there &s;eems to be a charm about her which prevents her receiving a &s;tain from any thing which happens; and Clari&s;&s;a, abandoned and undone, is the object not only of complacence but veneration.</P>
<P>I WOULD likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that if an author would have us feel a &s;trong degree of compa&s;&s;ion, his cha|racters mu&s;t not be too perfect. The &s;tern fortitude and inflexible re&s;olution of a Cato may command e|&s;teem, but does not excite tenderne&s;s; and faultle&s;s rectitude of conduct, though no rigour be mixed with it, is of too &s;ublime a nature to in&s;pire compa&s;&s;ion. Vir|tue has a kind of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency; it &s;tands upon its own ba&s;is, and cannot be injured by any violence. It mu&s;t therefore be mixed with &s;omething of helple&s;&s;ne&s;s and imperfection, with an exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility, or a &s;impli|city bordering upon weakne&s;s, before it rai&s;es, in any great degree, either tenderne&s;s or familiar love. If there be a fault in the ma&s;terly performance ju&s;t now mentioned, it is that the character of Clari&s;&s;a is &s;o in|flexibly right, her pa&s;&s;ions are under &s;uch perfect com|mand, and her prudence is &s;o equal to every occa&s;ion, that &s;he &s;eems not to need that &s;ympathy we &s;hould be&s;tow upon one of a le&s;s elevated character: and per|haps we &s;hould feel a livelier emotion of tenderne&s;s for Lovelace's Ro&s;e-bud, but that the &s;tory of Clari&s;&s;a is &s;o worked up by the &s;trength of colouring and the force of repeated impre&s;&s;ions, as to command all our &s;orrow.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="105">
PITY &s;eems too degrading a &s;entiment to be offered at the &s;hrine of faultle&s;s excellence. The &s;ufferings of martyrs are rather beheld with admiration and &s;ympa|thetic triumph than with tears; and we never feel much for tho&s;e whom we con&s;ider as them&s;elves rai&s;ed above common feelings.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t rule I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon is, that &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s &s;hould not be too long continued. All our finer feelings are in a manner momentary, and no art can carry them beyond a certain point, either in inten&s;e|ne&s;s or duration. Con&s;tant &s;uffering deadens the heart to tender impre&s;&s;ions; as we may ob&s;erve in &s;ailors, and others who are grown callous by a life of continual hard&s;hips. It is therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary in a long work to relieve the mind by &s;cenes of plea&s;ure and gaiety: and I cannot think it &s;o ab&s;urd a practice as our modern delicacy has repre&s;ented it, to intermix wit and fancy with the pathetic, provided care be taken not to check the pa&s;&s;ions while they are flowing. The tran&s;ition from a plea&s;urable &s;tate of mind to tender &s;orrow is not &s;o difficult as we imagine. When the mind is opened by gay and agreeable &s;cenes, every impre&s;&s;ion is felt more &s;en&s;ibly. Per&s;ons of a lively temper are much more &s;u&s;ceptible of that &s;udden &s;well of &s;en&s;ibility which occa&s;ions tears, than tho&s;e of a grave and &s;aturnine ca&s;t: for this rea&s;on women are more ea&s;ily moved to weeping than men. Tho&s;e who have touched the &s;prings of pity with the fine&s;t hand have mingled light &s;trokes of plea&s;antry and mirth in their mo&s;t pathetic pa&s;&s;ages. Very different is the conduct of many novel writers, who by plunging us into &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s without end or limit, exhau&s;t the powers, and
<PB N="103" REF="106">
before the conclu&s;ion either render us in&s;en&s;ible to every thing, or fix a real &s;adne&s;s upon the mind. The uni|form &s;tile of tragedies is one rea&s;on why they affect &s;o little. In our old plays all the force of language is re&s;erved for the more intere&s;ting parts; and in the &s;cenes of common life there is no attempt to ri&s;e above com|mon language: whereas we, by that pompous manner and affected &s;olemnity which we think it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve through the whole piece, lo&s;e the force of an elevated or pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ion where the occa&s;ion real|ly &s;ugge&s;ts it.</P>
<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered the manner in which ficti|tious di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be managed to render it plea&s;ing, let us reflect a little upon the moral tendency of &s;uch re|pre&s;entations. Much has been &s;aid in favour of them, and they are generally thought to improve the tender and humane feelings; but this, I own, appears to me very dubious. That they exerci&s;e &s;en&s;ibility is true, but &s;en&s;ibility does not increa&s;e with exerci&s;e. By the con&s;titution of our frame our habits increa&s;e, our emo|tions decrea&s;e, by repeated acts; and thus a wi&s;e pro|vi&s;ion is made, that as our compa&s;&s;ion grows weaker, its place &s;hould be &s;upplied by habitual benevolence. But in the&s;e writings our &s;en&s;ibility is &s;trongly called forth without any po&s;&s;ibility of exerting it&s;elf in virtuous action, and tho&s;e emotions, which we &s;hall never feel again with equal force, are wa&s;ted without advantage. Nothing is more dangerous than to let virtuous impre&s;|&s;ions of any kind pa&s;s through the mind without pro|ducing their proper effect. The awakenings of re|mor&s;e, virtuous &s;hame and indignation, the glow of moral approbation, if they do not lead to action, grow
<PB N="104" REF="107">
le&s;s and le&s;s vivid every time they recur, till at length the mind grows ab&s;olutely callous. The being affect|ed with a pathetic &s;tory is undoubtedly a &s;ign of an a|miable di&s;po&s;ition, but perhaps no means of increa&s;ing it. On the contrary, young people, by a cour&s;e of this kind of reading, often acquire &s;omething of that apa|thy and indifference which the experience of real life would have given them without its advantages.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on why plays and romances do not improve our humanity is, that they lead us to require a certain elegance of manners and delicacy of virtue which is not often found with poverty, ignorance, and meanne&s;s. The objects of pity in romance are as dif|ferent from tho&s;e in real life as our hu&s;bandmen from the &s;hepherds of Arcadia; and a girl who will &s;it weep|ing the whole night at the delicate di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a lady Charlotte or lady Julia, &s;hall be little moved at the complaint of her neighbour, who, in a homely phra&s;e and vulgar accent, laments to her that &s;he is not able to get bread for her family. Romance-writers like|wi&s;e make great misfortunes &s;o familiar to our ears, that we have hardly any pity to &s;pare for the common accidents of life: but we ought to remember, that mi&s;ery has a claim to relief, however we may be di&s;|gu&s;ted with its appearance; and that we mu&s;t not fancy our&s;elves charitable, when we are only plea&s;ing our ima|gination.</P>
<P>IT would perhaps be better, if our romances were more like tho&s;e of the old &s;tamp, which tended to rai&s;e human nature, and in&s;pire a certain grace and dignity of man|ners of which we have hardly the idea. The high no|tions
<PB N="105" REF="108">
of honour, the wild and fanciful &s;pirit of adven|ture and romantic love, elevated the mind; our novels tend to depre&s;s and enfeeble it. Yet there is a &s;pecies of this kind of writing which mu&s;t ever afford an exqui|&s;ite plea&s;ure to per&s;ons of ta&s;te and &s;en&s;ibility; where noble &s;entiments are mixed with well fancied inci|dents, pathetic touches with dignity and grace, and invention with cha&s;te correctne&s;s. Such will ever in|tere&s;t our &s;weete&s;t pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;hall conclude this paper with the following tale.</P>

<HEAD>A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the happy period of the golden age, when all the cele&s;tial inhabitants de&s;cended to the earth, and con|ver&s;ed familiarly with mortals, among the mo&s;t cheri&s;h|ed of the heavenly powers were twins, the offspring of Jupiter, LOVE and JOY. Wherever they appeared, the flowers &s;prung up beneath their feet, the &s;un &s;hone with a brighter radiance, and all nature &s;eemed embel|li&s;hed by their pre&s;ence. They were in&s;eparable com|panions, and their growing attachment was favoured by Jupiter, who had decreed that a la&s;ting union &s;hould be &s;olemnized between them &s;o &s;oon as they were arrived at maturer years. But in the mean time the &s;ons of men deviated from their native innocence; vice and ruin over-ran the earth with giant &s;trides; and A&s;trea with her train of cele&s;tial vi&s;itants for&s;ook their polluted abodes. Love alone remained, having been &s;tolen away by Hope, who was his nur&s;e, and conveyed by her to the fore&s;ts of Arcadia, where he was brought up among the &s;hepherds. But Jupiter a&s;&s;igned him a different partner, and commanded him to e&s;pou&s;e SORROW, the daughter of At&eacute;. He complied with re|luctance; for her features were har&s;h and di&s;agreeable, her eyes &s;unk, her forehead contracted into perpetual wrinkles, and her temples were covered with a wreath of cypre&s;s and wormwood. From this union &s;prung a virgin, in whom might be traced a &s;trong re&s;emblance of both her parents; but the &s;ullen and unamiable features of her mother were &s;o mixed and blended with the &s;weetne&s;s of her father, that her countenance, though mournful, was highly plea&s;ing. The maids and &s;hep|herds of the neighbouring plains gathered round and
<PB N="107" REF="110">
called her PITY. A red-brea&s;t was ob&s;erved to build in the cabin where &s;he was born; and while &s;he was yet an infant, a dove pur&s;ued by a hawk flew into her bo&s;om. This nymph had a dejected appearance, but &s;o &s;oft and gentle a mien that &s;he was beloved to a de|gree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. Her voice was low and plaintive, but inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;weet; and &s;he loved to lie for hours together on the banks of &s;ome wild and melancholy &s;tream, &s;inging to her lute. She taught men to weep, for &s;he took a &s;trange delight in tears; and often, when the virgins of the hamlet were a&s;&s;embled at their evening &s;ports, &s;he would &s;teal in among&s;t them, and captivate their hearts by her tales full of a charming &s;adne&s;s. She wore on her head a garland compo&s;ed of her father's myrtles twi&s;ted with her mother's cypre&s;s.</P>
<P>ONE day, as &s;he &s;at mu&s;ing by the waters of Helicon, her tears by chance fell into the fountain; and ever &s;ince, the Mu&s;es' &s;pring has retained a &s;trong ta&s;te of the infu|&s;ion. Pity was commanded by Jupiter to follow the &s;teps of her mother through the world, dropping balm into the wounds &s;he made, and binding up the hearts &s;he had broken. She follows with her hair loo&s;e, her bo|&s;om bare and throbbing, her garments torn by the bri|ars, and her feet bleeding with the roughne&s;s of the path. The nymph is mortal, for her mother is &s;o; and when &s;he has fulfilled her de&s;tined cour&s;e upon the earth, they &s;hall both expire together, and LOVE be a|gain united to JOY, his immortal and long betrothed bride.</P>
