<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. FAWCET.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Enter, driving a boy acro&s;s the &s;tage.</STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>AWAY! 'Sblood! Run for the Author! We can do nothing till he appears.</L>
<L>Tell him in le&s;s than five minutes we &s;hall have the hou&s;e about our ears!</L>
</LG>
<STAGE>[To the audience.]</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>Oh &s;irs! The prompter has mi&s;laid the prologue, and we are all a mort,</L>
<L>I &s;uppo&s;e our friends above yonder will &s;oon be making pretty &s;port;</L>
<L>For pity's &s;ake, &s;uffer us to go on without it&mdash;Good, dear &s;irs, do!</L>
<L>'Twas mo&s;t abominably dull&mdash;Zounds! There &s;tands the writer. Well, It's very true.</L>
<L>One of our te tum ti heroes was to have &s;poken it, who mea&s;ure non&s;en&s;e out by the yard;</L>
<L>And our chief hope was you'd make too much noi&s;e for it to be heard.</L>
<L>The author had mounted on the &s;tilts of oratory and elocution:</L>
<L>Not but he had a &s;mart touch or two, about Poland, France, and the&mdash;the revolution;</L>
<L>Telling us that Frenchman, and Poli&s;hman, and every man is our brother&punc;</L>
<L>And that all men, ay, even poor negro men, have a right to be free one as well as another!</L>
<L>Freedom at length, &s;aid he, like a torrent is &s;preading and &s;welling,</L>
<L>To &s;weep away pride and reach the mo&s;t mi&s;erable dwelling:</L>
<L>To ea&s;e happine&s;s, art, &s;cience, wit, and genius to give birth&punc;</L>
<L>Ay, to fertilize a world, and renovate old earth!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he went on, not mentioning a word about the play:</L>
<L>For he &s;ays prologues are blots, which ought to be wiped away:</L>
<L>A gothic practice, and in &s;pite of precedent, not the better for being old,</L>
<L>For, if we tell any part of the plot, it then becomes a tale twice told,</L>
<L>And &s;uch twice telling can rarely once excite our wonder:</L>
<L>Ergo, he that &s;ays nothing is lea&s;t likely to blunder.</L>
<L>Since therefore prologues are bad things at be&s;t, pray, my good friends,</L>
<L>Never mind the want of one, but live in hopes the play will make amends.</L>
