<HEAD>CHAPTER I. AN APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA, upon her return home, heard with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e that Mr. and Mrs. Harrel were by them&s;elves in the draw|ing room; and, while &s;he was upon the &s;tairs, Mrs. Harrel ran out, calling eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"Is that my brother?"</Q></P>
<P>Before &s;he could make an an&s;wer, Mr. Harrel, in the &s;ame impatient tone, ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"Is it Mr. Arnott?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No;"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"did you expect him &s;o late?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Expect him? Yes,"</Q> an|&s;wered Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"I have expected him the whole evening, and cannot conceive what he has done with him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis abominably provoking,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs.
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"that he &s;hould be out of the way ju&s;t now when he is wanted. However, I dare &s;ay to-morrow will do as well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know that,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"Reeves is &s;uch a wretch that I am &s;ure he will give me all the trouble in his power."</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Arnott entered; and Mrs. Harrel called out <Q REND="inline">"O brother, we have been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for you cruelly; we have had a man here who has plagued Mr. Har|rel to death, and we wanted you &s;adly to &s;peak to him"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have been very glad,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Arnott, <Q REND="inline">"to have been of any u&s;e, and per|haps it is not yet too late; who is the man?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, carele&s;sly, <Q REND="inline">"only a fellow from that ra&s;cally taylor who has been &s;o trouble&s;ome to me lately. He has had the impudence, becau&s;e I did not pay him the moment he was plea&s;ed to want his money, to put the bill into the hands of one Reeves, a griping attorney, who has been here this evening, and thought proper to talk to me pretty freely. I can tell the gentleman I &s;hall not ea&s;ily forget his impertinence! however, I really wi&s;h mean time I could get rid of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How much is the bill, Sir?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Arnott.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why its rather a round &s;um; but I don't know how it is, one's bills mount up before one is aware: tho&s;e fel|lows
<PB N="5" REF="4">
charge &s;uch confounded &s;ums for tape and buckram; I hardly know what I have had of him, and yet he has run me up a bill of between three and four hundred pound."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here there was a general &s;ilence,"</Q> till Mrs. Harrel &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Brother, can't you be &s;o good as to lend us the money? Mr. Harrel &s;ays he can pay it again very &s;oon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, very &s;oon,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;hall receive a great deal of money in a little time; I only want to &s;top this fellow's mouth for the pre&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;e I go and talk with him?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Arnott.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, he's a brute, a &s;tock!"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"nothing but the money will &s;atisfy him: he will hear no rea&s;on; one might as well talk to a &s;tone."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Arnott now looked extremely di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed; but upon his &s;i&s;ter's warmly pre&s;&s;ing him not to lo&s;e any time, he gently &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If this per&s;on will but wait a week or two, I &s;hould be extremely glad, for really ju&s;t now I cannot take up &s;o much money, without &s;uch particular lo&s;s and inconveni|ence, that I hardly know how to do it:&mdash;but yet, if he will not be appea&s;ed, he mu&s;t certainly have it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Appea&s;ed?"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"you might as well appea&s;e the &s;ea in a &s;torm! he is hard as iron."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
Mr. Arnott then, forcing a &s;mile, though evidently in much unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid he would not fail to rai&s;e the money the next morn|ing, and was taking his leave, when Cecilia, &s;hocked that &s;uch tenderne&s;s and good-na|ture &s;hould be thus gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon, ha&s;tily begged to &s;peak with Mrs. Harrel, and taking her into another room, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I be&s;eech you, my dear friend, let not your worthy brother &s;uffer by his genero&s;ity; permit me in the pre&s;ent exigence to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Harrel: my having &s;uch a &s;um ad|vanced can be of no con&s;equence; but I &s;hould grieve indeed that your brother, who &s;o nobly under&s;tands the u&s;e of money, &s;hould take it up at any particular di&s;ad|vantage."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are va&s;tly kind,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Har|rel, <Q REND="inline">"and I will run and &s;peak to them about it: but which ever of you lends the money, Mr. Harrel has a&s;&s;ured me he &s;hall pay it very &s;oon."</Q></P>
<P>She then returned with the propo&s;ition. Mr. Arnott &s;trongly oppo&s;ed it, but Mr. Harrel &s;eemed rather to prefer it, yet &s;poke &s;o confidently of his &s;peedy payment, that he appeared to think it a matter of little importance from which he accepted it. A generous conte&s;t en&s;ued between Mr. Ar|nott and Cecilia, but as &s;he was very earne&s;t, &s;he at length prevailed, and &s;ettled to go
<PB N="7" REF="6">
her&s;elf the next morning into the city, in order to have the money advanced by Mr. Briggs, who had the management of her fortune entirely to him&s;elf, her other guar|dians never interfering in the executive part of her affairs.</P>
<P>This arranged, they all retired.</P>
<P>And then, with encrea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, Cecilia reflected upon the ruinous levity of Mr. Harrel, and the blind &s;ecurity of his wife; &s;he &s;aw in their &s;ituation danger the mo&s;t alarming, and in the behaviour of Mr. Harrel &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s the mo&s;t inexcu&s;|able; &s;uch glaring inju&s;tice to his credi|tors, &s;uch utter in&s;en&s;ibility to his friends, took from her all wi&s;h of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, though the indignant compa&s;&s;ion with which &s;he &s;aw the ea&s;y genero&s;ity of Mr. Arnott &s;o frequently abu&s;ed, had now, for his &s;ake merely, induced her to relieve him.</P>
<P>She re&s;olved, however, as &s;oon as the pre|&s;ent difficulty was &s;urmounted, to make another attempt to open the eyes of Mrs. Harrel to the evils which &s;o apparently threatened her, and pre&s;s her to exert all her influence with her hu&s;band, by means both of example and advice, to retrench his expences before it &s;hould be ab&s;olutely too late to &s;ave him from ruin.</P>
<P>She determined al&s;o at the &s;ame time that &s;he applied for the money requi&s;ite for this
<PB N="8" REF="7">
debt, to take up enough for di&s;charging her own bill at the book&s;ellers, and putting in execution her plan of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Hills.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;he aro&s;e early, and attended by her &s;ervant, &s;et out for the hou&s;e of Mr. Briggs, purpo&s;ing, as the wea|ther was clear and fro&s;ty, to walk through Oxford Road, and then put her&s;elf into a chair; and hoping to return to Mr. Har|rel's by the u&s;ual hour of breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>She had not proceeded far, before &s;he &s;aw a mob gathering, and the windows of almo&s;t all the hou&s;es filling with &s;pectators. She de&s;ired her &s;ervant to enquire what this meant, and was informed that the people were a&s;&s;embling to &s;ee &s;ome malefactors pa&s;s by in their way to Tyburn.</P>
<P>Alarmed at this intelligence from the fear of meeting the unhappy criminals, &s;he ha&s;|tily turned down the next &s;treet, but found that al&s;o filling with people who were run|ning to the &s;cene &s;he was trying to avoid: encircled thus every way, &s;he applied to a maid &s;ervant who was &s;tanding at the door of a large hou&s;e, and begged leave to &s;tep in till the mob was gone by. The maid immediately con&s;ented, and &s;he waited here while &s;he &s;ent her man for a chair.</P>
<P>He &s;oon arrived with one; but ju&s;t as &s;he returned to the &s;treet door, a gentleman, who was ha&s;tily entering the hou&s;e, &s;tanding
<PB N="9" REF="8">
back to let her pa&s;s, &s;uddenly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> and looking at him, &s;he perceived young Delvile.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot &s;top an in&s;tant,"</Q> cried &s;he, running down the &s;teps, <Q REND="inline">"le&s;t the crowd &s;hould prevent the chair from going on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you not fir&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid he, handing her in, <Q REND="inline">"tell me what news you have heard?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"News?"</Q> repeated &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"No, I have heard none!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will only, then, laugh at me for tho&s;e officious offers you did &s;o well to re|ject?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not what offers you mean!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They were indeed &s;uperfluous, and there|fore I wonder not you have forgotten them. Shall I tell the chairmen whither to go?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To Mr. Briggs. But I cannot ima|gine what you mean."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To Mr. Briggs!"</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"O live for ever French beads and Bri&s;tol &s;tones! fre&s;h offers may perhaps be made there, impertinent, officious, and u&s;ele&s;s as mine!"</Q></P>
<P>He then told her &s;ervant the direction, and, making his bow, went into the hou&s;e &s;he had ju&s;t quitted.</P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely amazed by this &s;hort, but unintelligible conver&s;ation, would again have called upon him to explain his mean|ing,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
but found the crowd encrea&s;ing &s;o fa&s;t that &s;he could not venture to detain the chair, which with difficulty made its way to the adjoining &s;treets: but her &s;urprize at what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o entirely occupied her, that when &s;he &s;topt at the hou&s;e of Mr. Briggs, &s;he had almo&s;t forgotten what had brought her thither.</P>
<P>The foot-boy, who came to the door, told her that his ma&s;ter was at home, but not well.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired he might be acquainted that &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to him upon bu&s;ine&s;s, and would wait upon him again at any hour when he thought he &s;hould be able to &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er.</P>
<P>The boy returned with an an&s;wer that &s;he might call again the next week.</P>
<P>Cecilia, knowing that &s;o long a delay would de&s;troy all the kindne&s;s of her inten|tion, determined to write to him for the money, and therefore went into the parlour, and de&s;ired to have pen and ink.</P>
<P>The boy, after making her wait &s;ome time in a room without any fire, brought her a pen and a little ink in a broken tea cup, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Ma&s;ter begs you won't &s;pirt it about, for he's got no more; and all our blacking's as good as gone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Blacking?"</Q> repeated Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Mi&s;s; when Ma&s;ter's &s;hoes are
<PB N="11" REF="10">
blacked, we commonly gets a little drap of fre&s;h ink."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia promi&s;ed to be careful, but de|&s;ired him to fetch her a &s;heet of paper.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Law, Mi&s;s,"</Q> cried the boy, with a grin, <Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay ma&s;ter'd as &s;oon give you a bit of his no&s;e! how&s;ever, I'll go ax."</Q></P>
<P>In a few minutes he again returned, and brought in his hand a &s;late and a black lead pencil; <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">Ma&s;ter &s;ays how you may write upon this, for he &s;uppo&s;es you've no great matters to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">y."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, much a&s;toni&s;hed at this extreme par&s;imony, was obliged to con&s;ent, but as the point of the pencil was very blunt, de&s;ir|ed the boy to get her a knife that &s;he might cut it. He obeyed, but &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Pray Mi&s;s, take care it ben't known, for ma&s;ter don't do &s;uch a thing once in a year, and if he know'd I'd got you the knife, he'd go nigh to give me a good polt of the head."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then wrote upon the &s;late her de|&s;ire to be informed in what manner &s;he &s;hould &s;end him her receipt for 600<HI>l.</HI> which &s;he begged to have in&s;tantly advanced.</P>
<P>The boy came back grinning, and hold|ing up his hands, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s, there's a fine piece of work up &s;tairs! Ma&s;ter's in a peck of troubles; but he &s;ays how he'll come down, if you'll &s;tay till he's got his things on."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
<Q REND="inline">"Does he keep his bed, then? I hope I have not made him ri&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Mi&s;s, he don't keep his bed, only he mu&s;t get ready, for he wears no great matters of cloaths when he's alone. You are to know, Mi&s;s,"</Q> lowering his voice, <Q REND="inline">"that that day as he went abroad with our &s;weep's cloaths on, he comed home in &s;ich a pickle you never &s;ee! I believe &s;omebody'd knocked him in the kennel; &s;o does Moll; but don't you &s;ay as I teld you! He's been &s;pecial bad ever &s;ince. Moll and I was as glad as could be, becau&s;e he's &s;o plaguy &s;harp; for, to let you know, Mi&s;s, he's &s;o near, it's partly a wonder how he lives at all: and yet he's worth a power of money, too."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, not very de|&s;irous to encourage his forwardne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"if I want any thing, I'll call for you."</Q></P>
<P>The boy, however, glad to tell his tale, went on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Our Moll won't &s;tay with him above a week longer, Mi&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he &s;ays how &s;he can't get nothing to eat, but ju&s;t &s;ome old &s;tinking &s;alt meat, that's &s;tayed in the but|cher's &s;hop &s;o long, it would make a hor&s;e &s;ick to look at it. But Moll's pretty nice; how&s;ever, Mi&s;s, to let you know, we don't get a good meal &s;o often as once a quarter! why this la&s;t week we ha'n't had nothing at
<PB N="13" REF="12">
all but &s;ome dry mu&s;ty red herrings; &s;o you may think, Mi&s;s, we're kept pretty &s;harp!"</Q></P>
<P>He was now interrupted by hearing Mr. Briggs coming down the &s;tairs, upon which, abruptly breaking off his complaints, he held up his finger to his no&s;e in token of &s;ecrecy, and ran ha&s;tily into the kitchen.</P>
<P>The appearance of Mr. Briggs was by no means rendered more attractive by illne&s;s and negligence of dre&s;s. He had on a flannel gown and night cap; his black beard, of many days growth, was long and grim, and upon his no&s;e and one of his cheeks was a large patch of brown paper, which, as he entered the room, he held on with both his hands.</P>
<P>Cecilia made many apologies for having di&s;turbed him, and &s;ome civil enquiries concerning his health.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay,"</Q> cried he, petti&s;hly, <Q REND="inline">"bad enough: all along of that trumpery ma&s;|querade; wi&s;h I had not gone! Fool for my pains."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When were you taken ill, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Met with an accident; got a fall, broke my head, like to have lo&s;t my wig. Wi&s;h the ma&s;querade at old Nick! thought it would co&s;t nothing, or would not have gone. Warrant &s;ha'n't get me &s;o &s;oon to another!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you fall in going home, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, plump in the kennel; could hardly get out of it; felt my&s;elf a going, was afraid to tear my cloaths, knew the ra&s;cal would make me pay for them, &s;o by holding up the old &s;ack, come bolt on my face! off pops my wig; could not tell what to do; all as dark as pitch!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did not you call for help?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nobody by but &s;crubs. Knew they would not help for nothing. Scrawled out as I could, groped about for my wig, found it at la&s;t, all &s;ou&s;ed in the mud; &s;tuck to my head like Turner's cerate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, then, you got into an hack|ney coach?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What for? to make things wor&s;e? was not bad enough, hay?&mdash;mu&s;t pay two &s;hillings be&s;ide?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how did you find your&s;elf when you got home, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How? why wet as muck; my head all bumps, my cheek all cut, my no&s;e big as two! forced to wear a plai&s;ter; half ruined in vinegar. Got a great cold; put me in a fever; never been well &s;ince."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But have you had no advice, Sir? &s;hould not you &s;end for a phy&s;ician?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What to do, hay? fill me with jallop? can get it my&s;elf, can't I? Had one once; was taken very bad, thought &s;hould have popt off; began to flinch, &s;ent for the doc|tor,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
proved nothing but a cheat! co&s;t me a guinea, gave it at fourth vi&s;it, and he ne|ver came again!&mdash;warrant won't have no more!"</Q></P>
<P>Then perceiving upon the table &s;ome du&s;t from the black lead pencil, <Q REND="inline">"What's here?"</Q> cried he, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"who's been cutting the pencil? wi&s;h they were hanged; &s;uppo&s;e its the boy; de&s;erves to be hor&s;e-whipped: give him a good banging."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia immediately cleared him, by ac|knowledging &s;he had her&s;elf been the cul|prit.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"thought as much all the time! gue&s;&s;ed how it was; nothing but ruin and wa&s;te; &s;ending for money, nobody knows why; wanting 600<HI>l.</HI>&mdash;what to do? throw it in the dirt? Never heard the like! Sha'n't have it, promi&s;e you that,"</Q> nodding his head, <Q REND="inline">"&s;han't have no &s;uch thing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sha'n't have it?"</Q> cried Cecilia, much &s;urpri&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"why not, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Keep it for your hu&s;band; get you one &s;oon: won't have no juggling. Don't be in a hurry; one in my eye."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then began a very earne&s;t expo&s;|tulation, a&s;&s;uring him &s;he really wanted the money, for an occa&s;ion which would not admit of delay.</P>
<P>Her remon&s;trances, however, he wholly di&s;regarded, telling her that girls knew no|thing
<PB N="16" REF="15">
of the value of money, and ought not to be tru&s;ted with it; that he would not hear of &s;uch extravagance, and was re&s;olved not to advance her a penny.</P>
<P>Cecilia was both provoked and confound|ed by a refu&s;al &s;o unexpected, and as &s;he thought her&s;elf bound in honour to Mr. Harrel not to make known the motive of her urgency, &s;he was for &s;ome time totally &s;ilenced: till recollecting her account with the book&s;eller, &s;he determined to re&s;t her plea upon that, per&s;uaded that he could not, at lea&s;t, deny her money to pay her own bills.</P>
<P>He heard her, however, with the utmo&s;t contempt; <Q REND="inline">"Books?"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"what do you want with books? do no good; all lo&s;t time; words get no ca&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>She informed him his admonitions were not too late, as &s;he had already received them, and mu&s;t therefore nece&s;&s;arily pay for them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;end 'em back, that's be&s;t; keep no &s;uch rubbi&s;h, won't turn to account; do better without 'em."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, will be impo&s;&s;ible, for I have had them &s;ome time, and cannot ex|pect the book&s;eller to take them again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t, mu&s;t,"</Q> cried he," <Q REND="inline">"can't help him&s;elf; glad to have 'em too. Are but a minor, can't be made pay a farthing."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
Cecilia with much indignation heard &s;uch fraud recommended, and told him &s;he could by no means con&s;ent to follow his advice. But &s;he &s;oon found, to her utter amaze|ment, that he &s;teadily refu&s;ed to give her any other, or to be&s;tow the &s;lighte&s;t atten|tion upon her expo&s;tulations, &s;turdily &s;ay|ing that her uncle had left her a noble e&s;tate, and he would take care to &s;ee it put in pro|per hands, by getting her a good and care|ful hu&s;band.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have no intention, no wi&s;h, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"to break into the income or e&s;tate left me by my uncle; on the contra|ry, I hold them &s;acred, and think my&s;elf bound in con&s;cience never to live beyond them; but the 10,000<HI>l.</HI> bequeathed me by my Father, I regard as more peculiarly my own property, and therefore think my&s;elf at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of it as I plea&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> cried he, in a rage, <Q REND="inline">"make it over to a &s;crubby book&s;eller! give it up for an old pot-hook? no, no, won't &s;uffer it; &s;ha'n't be, &s;ha'n't be, I &s;ay! if you want &s;ome books, go to Moorfields, pick up enough at an old &s;tall; get 'em at two|pence a-piece; dear enough, too."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia for &s;ome time hoped he was mere|ly indulging his &s;trange and &s;ordid humour by an oppo&s;ition that was only intended to teize her; but &s;he &s;oon found her&s;elf ex|tremely

mi&s;taken: he was immoveable in ob&s;tinacy, as he was incorrigible in avarice; he neither troubled him&s;elf with enquiries nor rea&s;oning, but was contented with re|fu&s;ing her as a child might be refu&s;ed, by peremptorily telling her &s;he did not know what &s;he wanted, and therefore &s;hould not have what &s;he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>And with this an&s;wer, after all that &s;he could urge, &s;he was compelled to leave the hou&s;e, as he complained that his brown paper plai&s;ter wanted fre&s;h dipping in vine|gar, and he could &s;tay talking no longer.</P>
<P>The di&s;gu&s;t with which this behaviour filled her, was doubled by the &s;hame and concern of returning to the Harrels with her promi&s;e unperformed; &s;he deliberated upon every method that occurred to her of &s;till endeavouring to &s;erve them, but could &s;ugge&s;t nothing, except trying to prevail upon Mr. Delvile to interfere in her favour. She liked not, indeed, the office of &s;olicita|tion to &s;o haughty a man, but, having no other expedient, her repugnance gave way to her genero&s;ity, and &s;he ordered the chair|men to carry her to St. James's Square.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A PERPLEXITY.</HEAD>
<P>AND here, at the door of his Father's hou&s;e, and ju&s;t a&s;cending the &s;teps, &s;he perceived young Delvile.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Again!"</Q> cried he, handing her out of the chair, <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely &s;ome good genius is at work for me this morning!"</Q></P>
<P>She told him &s;he &s;hould not have cal|led &s;o early, now &s;he was acquainted with the late hours of Mrs. Delvile, but that &s;he merely meant to &s;peak with his Father, for two minutes, upon bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>He attended her up &s;tairs; and finding &s;he was in ha&s;te, went him&s;elf with her me&s;|&s;age to Mr. Delvile: and &s;oon returned with an an&s;wer that he would wait upon her pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The &s;trange &s;peeches he had made to her when they fir&s;t met in the morning now re|curring to her memory, &s;he determined to have them explained, and in order to lead to the &s;ubject, mentioned the di&s;agreeable &s;ituation in which he had found her, while &s;he was &s;tanding up to avoid the &s;ight of the condemned malefactors.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed?"</Q> cried he, in a tone of voice &s;omewhat incredulous, <Q REND="inline">"and was that the purpo&s;e for which you &s;tood up?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, Sir;&mdash;what other could I have?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None, &s;urely!"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"but the accident was &s;ingularly opportune."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Opportune?"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;taring, <Q REND="inline">"how opportune? this is the &s;econd time in the &s;ame morning that I am not able to under&s;tand you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How <HI>&s;hould</HI> you under&s;tand what is &s;o little intelligible?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you have &s;ome meaning which I cannot fathom, why, el&s;e, &s;hould it be &s;o extraordinary that I &s;hould endeavour to avoid a mob? or how could it be opportune that I &s;hould happen to meet with one?"</Q></P>
<P>He laughed at fir&s;t without making any an&s;wer; but perceiving &s;he looked at him with impatience, he half gayly, half re|proachfully, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Whence is it that young ladies, even &s;uch who&s;e principles are mo&s;t &s;trict, &s;eem univer&s;ally, in tho&s;e affairs where their affections are concerned, to think hypocri&s;y nece&s;&s;ary, and deceit amiable? and hold it graceful to di&s;avow to-day, what they may perhaps mean pub|licly to acknowledge to-morrow?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who heard the&s;e que&s;tions with
<PB N="21" REF="20">
unfeigned a&s;toni&s;hment, looked at him with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s for an explanation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you &s;o much wonder,"</Q> he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould have hoped in Mi&s;s Beverley to have &s;een &s;ome deviation from &s;uch rules? and have expected more open|ne&s;s and candour in a young lady who has given &s;o noble a proof of the liberality of her mind and under&s;tanding?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You amaze me beyond mea&s;ure!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what rules, what candour, what liberality, do you mean?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t I &s;peak yet more plainly? and if I do, will you bear to hear me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I &s;hould be extremely glad if you would give me leave to under&s;tand you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And may I tell you what has charmed me, as well as what I have pre&s;umed to wonder at?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may tell me any thing, if you will but be le&s;s my&s;terious."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Forgive then the frankne&s;s you invite, and let me acknowledge to you how greatly I honour the noblene&s;s of your conduct. Surrounded as you are by the opulent and the &s;plendid, un&s;hackled by dependance, unre&s;trained by authority, ble&s;t by nature with all that is attractive, by &s;ituation with all that is de&s;irable,&mdash;to &s;light the rich, and

<P><Q REND="inline">"I find,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t for|bear any further enquiry, for the more I hear, the le&s;s I under&s;tand."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"if here I return to my fir&s;t que&s;tion: whence is it that a young lady who can think &s;o nobly, and act &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly, &s;hould not be uniformly great, &s;imple in truth, and un|affected in &s;incerity? Why &s;hould &s;he be thus guarded, where frankne&s;s would do her &s;o much honour? Why blu&s;h in owning what all others may blu&s;h in envying?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed you perplex me intolerably;"</Q> cried Cecilia, with &s;ome vexation, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, will you not be more explicit?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why, Madam,"</Q> returned he, with a laugh, <Q REND="inline">"would you tempt me to be more impertinent? have I not &s;aid &s;trange things already?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Strange indeed,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for not one of them can I comprehend!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon, then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"and forget them all! I &s;carce know my&s;elf what urged me to &s;ay them, but I began inadvertently, without intending to go on, and I have
<PB N="23" REF="22">
proceeded involuntarily, without knowing how to &s;top. The fault, however, is ulti|mately your own, for the &s;ight of you creates an in&s;urmountable de&s;ire to conver&s;e with you, and your conver&s;ation a propen&s;ity equally incorrigible to take &s;ome intere&s;t in your welfare."</Q></P>
<P>He would then have changed the di&s;|cour&s;e, and Cecilia, a&s;hamed of pre&s;&s;ing him further, was for &s;ome time &s;ilent; but when one of the &s;ervants came to inform her that his ma&s;ter meant to wait upon her directly, her unwillingne&s;s to leave the mat|ter in &s;u&s;pence induced her, &s;omewhat ab|ruptly, to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, you are thinking of Mr. Belfield?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A happy conjecture!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"but &s;o wild a one, I cannot but marvel how it &s;hould occur to you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t ac|knowledge I now under&s;tand your meaning; but with re&s;pect to what has given ri&s;e to it, I am as much a &s;tranger as ever."</Q></P>
<P>The entrance of Mr. Delvile here clo&s;ed the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>He began with his u&s;ual o&s;tentatious apologies, declaring he had &s;o many people to attend, &s;o many complaints to hear, and &s;o many grievances to redre&s;s, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to wait upon her &s;ooner,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
and not without difficulty that he waited upon her now.</P>
<P>Mean time his &s;on almo&s;t immediately retired: and Cecilia, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to this harangue, was only di&s;turbing her&s;elf with conjectures upon what had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed. She &s;aw that young Delvile concluded &s;he was ab&s;olutely engaged to Mr. Belfield, and though &s;he was better plea&s;ed that any &s;u&s;picion &s;hould fall there than upon Sir Robert Floyer, &s;he was yet both provoked and concerned to be &s;u&s;pected at all. An attack &s;o earne&s;t from almo&s;t any other per&s;on could hardly have failed being very offen&s;ive to her, but in the manners of young Delvile good breeding was &s;o hap|pily blended with frankne&s;s, that his free|dom &s;eemed merely to re&s;ult from the open|ne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and even in its very act pleaded its own excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Her reverie was at length interrupted by Mr. Delvile's de&s;iring to know in what he could &s;erve her.</P>
<P>She told him &s;he had pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for 600<HI>l.</HI> and hoped he would not object to her taking up that &s;um.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Six hundred pounds,"</Q> &s;aid he, after &s;ome deliberation, <Q REND="inline">"is rather an extraor|dinary demand for a young lady in your &s;ituation; your allowance is con&s;iderable,
<PB N="25" REF="24">
you have yet no hou&s;e, no equipage, no e&s;tabli&s;hment; your expences, I &s;hould imagine, cannot be very great&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt, and &s;eemed weighing her re|que&s;t.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;hocked at appearing extrava|gant, yet too generous to mention Mr. Harrel, had again recour&s;e to her book|&s;eller's bill, which &s;he told him &s;he was anxious to di&s;charge.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A book&s;eller's bill?"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"and do you want 600<HI>l.</HI> for a book&s;eller's bill?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;tammering, <Q REND="inline">"no,&mdash;not all for that,&mdash;I have &s;ome other&mdash;I have a particular occa&s;ion&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what bill at all,"</Q> cried he, with much &s;urpri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"can a young lady have with a book&s;eller? The Spectator, Tatler and Guardian, would make library &s;ufficient for any female in the kingdom, nor do I think it like a gentlewoman to have more. Be&s;ides, if you ally your&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as I &s;hall approve and recommend, you will, in all probability, find already collected more books than there can ever be any po&s;&s;ible occa&s;ion for you to look into. And let me coun&s;el you to remember that a lady, whether &s;o called from birth or only from fortune, &s;hould never degrade
<PB N="26" REF="25">
her&s;elf by being put on a level with writers, and &s;uch &s;ort of people."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him for his advice, but confe&s;&s;ed that upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion it came too late, as the books were now actually in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And have you taken,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;uch a mea&s;ure as this without con&s;ulting me? I thought I had a&s;&s;ured you my opinion was always at your &s;ervice when you were in any dilemma."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"but I knew how much you were occupied, and wi&s;hed to avoid taking up your time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot blame your mode&s;ty,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"and therefore, as you have con|tracted the debt, you are, in honour, bound to pay it. Mr. Briggs, however, has the entire management of your fortune, my many avocations obliging me to decline &s;o laborious a tru&s;t; apply, therefore, to him, and, as things are &s;ituated, I will make no oppo&s;ition to your demand."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have already, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;poke to Mr. Briggs, but&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You went to him fir&s;t, then?"</Q> inter|rupted Mr. Delvile, with a look of much di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was unwilling, Sir, to trouble you till I found it unavoidable."</Q> She then
<PB N="27" REF="26">
acquainted him with Mr. Brigg's refu&s;al, and entreated he would do her the fa|vour to intercede in her behalf, that the money might no longer be denied her.</P>
<P>Every word &s;he &s;poke his pride &s;eemed ri&s;ing to re&s;ent, and when &s;he had done, after regarding her &s;ome time with apparent indignation, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> intercede! <HI>I</HI> be|come an agent!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, amazed to find him thus vio|lently irritated, made a very earne&s;t apology for her reque&s;t; but without paying her any attention, he walked up and down the room, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"an agent! and to Mr. Briggs!&mdash;This is an affront I could never have expected! why did I degrade my&s;elf by accepting this humiliating office? I ought to have known better!"</Q> Then, turning to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Child,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"for whom is it you take me, and for what?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia again, though affronted in her turn, began &s;ome prote&s;tations of re&s;pect; but haughtily interrupting her, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If of me, and of my rank in life you judge by Mr. Briggs or by Mr. Harrel, I may be &s;ubject to propo&s;als &s;uch as the&s;e every day; &s;uffer me, therefore, for your better information, to hint to you, that the head of an ancient and honourable hou&s;e, is apt to think him&s;elf &s;omewhat &s;uperior
<PB N="28" REF="27">
to people but ju&s;t ri&s;ing from du&s;t and ob&s;curity."</Q></P>
<P>Thunder&s;truck by this imperious re|proof, &s;he could attempt no further vindi|cation; but when he ob&s;erved her con|&s;ternation, he was &s;omewhat appea&s;ed, and hoping he had now impre&s;&s;ed her with a proper &s;en&s;e of his dignity, he more gently &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You did not, I believe, intend to in&s;ult me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven, Sir; no!"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"nothing was more di&s;tant from my thoughts: if my expre&s;&s;ions have been faulty, it has been wholly from ignorance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well, we will think then no more of it."</Q></P>
<P>She then &s;aid &s;he would no longer detain him, and, without daring to again mention her petition, &s;he wi&s;hed him good morning.</P>
<P>He &s;uffered her to go, yet, as &s;he left the room, graciou&s;ly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Think no more of my di&s;plea&s;ure, for it is over: I &s;ee you were not were of the extraordinary thing you propo&s;ed.

<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
Cecilia concurred, and, court&s;ying, took her leave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah!</Q> thought &s;he, in her way home, <Q REND="inline">how happy is it for me that I followed the advice of Mr. Monckton! el&s;e I had &s;urely made intere&s;t to become an inmate of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t hou&s;e, and then indeed, as he wi&s;ely fore&s;aw, I &s;hould inevitably have been over|whelmed by this pompous in&s;olence! no family, however amiable, could make amends for &s;uch a ma&s;ter of it.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. AN ADMONITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Harrels and Mr. Arnott waited the return of Cecilia with the utmo&s;t impatience; &s;he told them with much con|cern the failure of her emba&s;&s;y, which Mr. Harrel heard with vi&s;ible re&s;entment and di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ent, while Mr. Arnott, entreating him not to think of it, again made an offer of his &s;ervices, and declared he would di&s;|regard all per&s;onal inconvenience for the plea&s;ure of making him and his &s;i&s;ter ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Cecilia was much mortified that &s;he had not the power to act the &s;ame part, and a&s;ked Mr. Harrel whether he believed his own influence with Mr. Briggs would be more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"the old curmudgeon would but the rather refu&s;e. I know his rea&s;on, and therefore am &s;ure all pleas will be vain. He has dealings in the alley, and I dare &s;ay games with your money as if it were his own. There is, indeed, one way&mdash;but I do not think you would like it&mdash;though I prote&s;t I

<PB N="31" REF="30">
hardly know why not&mdash;however, 'tis as well let alone."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia in&s;i&s;ted upon hearing what he meant, and, after &s;ome he&s;itation, he hinted that there were means by which, with very little inconvenience, &s;he might borrow the money.</P>
<P>Cecilia, with that horror natural to all unpracti&s;ed minds at the fir&s;t idea of con|tracting a voluntary debt, &s;tarted at this &s;ugge&s;tion, and &s;eemed very ill di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to it. Mr. Harrel, perceiving her repugnance, turned to Mr. Arnott, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, my good brother, I hardly know how to &s;uffer you to &s;ell out at &s;uch a lo&s;s, but yet, my pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity is &s;o urgent&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't mention it,"</Q> cried Mr. Arnott, <Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry I let you know it; be certain, however, that while I have any thing, it is yours and my &s;i&s;ters."</Q></P>
<P>The two gentlemen were then retiring together; but Cecilia, &s;hocked for Mr. Arnott, though unmoved by Mr. Harrel, &s;topt them to enquire what was the way by which it was meant &s;he could borrow the money?</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel &s;eemed aver&s;e to an&s;wer, but &s;he would not be refu&s;ed; and then he mentioned a Jew, of who&s;e hone&s;ty he had made undoubted trial, and who, as &s;he was
<PB N="32" REF="31">
&s;o near being of age, would accept very trifling intere&s;t for whatever &s;he &s;hould like to take up.</P>
<P>The heart of Cecilia recoiled at the very mention of a <HI>Jew,</HI> and <HI>taking up money upon intere&s;t;</HI> but, impelled &s;trongly by her own genero&s;ity to emulate that of Mr. Arnott, &s;he agreed, after &s;ome he&s;itation, to have recour&s;e to this method.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel then made &s;ome faint denials, and Mr. Arnott prote&s;ted he had a thou&s;and times rather &s;ell out at any di&s;count, than con&s;ent to her taking &s;uch a mea&s;ure; but, when her fir&s;t reluctance was conquered, all that he urged &s;erved but to &s;hew his wor|thine&s;s in a &s;tronger light, and only en|crea&s;ed her de&s;ire of &s;aving him from &s;uch repeated impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Her total ignorance in what manner to tran&s;act this bu&s;ine&s;s, made her next put it wholly into the hands of Mr. Harrel, whom &s;he begged to take up 600<HI>l.</HI> upon &s;uch terms as he thought equitable, and to which, whatever they might be, &s;he would &s;ign her name.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;um, but without any que&s;tion or objection undertook the commi&s;&s;ion: and Cecilia would not le&s;&s;en it, becau&s;e unwilling to do more for the &s;ecurity of the luxurious Mr. Harrel, than for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the labo|rious Hills.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
Nothing could be more &s;peedy than the execution of this affair, Mr. Harrel was di|ligent and expert, the whole was &s;ettled that morning, and, giving to the Jew her bond for the payment at the intere&s;t he re|quired, &s;he put into the hands of Mr. Har|rel 350<HI>l.</HI> for which he gave his receipt, and &s;he kept the re&s;t for her own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>She intended the morning after this tran&s;|action to &s;ettle her account with the book|&s;eller. When &s;he went into the parlour to breakfa&s;t, &s;he was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee Mr. Harrel &s;eated there, in earne&s;t di&s;|cour&s;e with his wife. Fearful of interrupting a t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te &s;o uncommon, &s;he would have retired, but Mr. Harrel, calling after her, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"O pray come in! I am only telling Pri&s;cilla a piece of my u&s;ual ill luck. You mu&s;t know I happen to be in immediate want of 200<HI>l.</HI> though only for three or four days, and I &s;ent to order hone&s;t old Aaron to come hither directly with the money, but it &s;o happens that he went out of town the moment he had done with us ye&s;terday, and will not be back again this week. Now I don't believe there is another Jew in the kingdom who will let me have money upon the &s;ame terms: they are &s;uch notorious ra&s;cals, that I hate the very thought of em|ploying them."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who could not but under&s;tand
<PB N="34" REF="33">
what this meant, was too much di&s;plea&s;ed both by his extravagance and his indelica|cy, to feel at all inclined to change the de|&s;tination of the money &s;he had ju&s;t receiv|ed; and therefore coolly agreed that it was unfortunate, but added nothing more.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, it is provoking indeed,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"for the extra-intere&s;t I mu&s;t pay one of tho&s;e extortioners is ab&s;olutely &s;o much money thrown away."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;till without noticing the&s;e hints, began her breakfa&s;t. Mr. Harrel then &s;aid he would take his tea with them: and, while he was buttering &s;ome dry toa&s;t, ex|claimed, as if from &s;udden recollection, <Q REND="inline">"O Lord, now I think of it, I believe, Mi&s;s Beverley, you can lend me this money your&s;elf for a day or two. The moment old Aaron comes to town, I will pay you."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who&s;e genero&s;ity, however ex|ten&s;ive, was neither thoughtle&s;s nor indi&s;|criminate, found &s;omething &s;o repul&s;ive in this gro&s;s procedure, that in&s;tead of a&s;&s;ent|ing to his reque&s;t with her u&s;ual alacrity, &s;he an&s;wered very gravely that the money &s;he had ju&s;t received was already appropri|ated to a particular purpo&s;e, and &s;he knew not how to defer making u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel was extremely chagrined by this reply, which was by no means what he expected; but, to&s;&s;ing down a di&s;h of tea,
<PB N="35" REF="34">
he began humming an air, and &s;oon reco|vered his u&s;ual unconcern.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, ringing his bell, he de|&s;ired a &s;ervant to go to Mr. Zackery, and inform him that he wanted to &s;peak with him immediately.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And now,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a look in which vexation &s;eemed &s;truggling with care|le&s;sne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"the thing is done! I don't like, indeed, to get into &s;uch hands, for 'tis hard ever to get out of them when once one be|gins,&mdash;and hitherto I have kept pretty clear. But there's no help for it&mdash;Mr. Arnott can|not ju&s;t now a&s;&s;i&s;t me&mdash;and &s;o the thing mu&s;t take its cour&s;e. Pri&s;cilla, why do you look &s;o grave?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am thinking how unlucky it is my Brother &s;hould happen to be unable to lend you this money."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, don't think about it; I &s;hall get rid of the man very &s;oon I dare &s;ay&mdash;I hope &s;o, at lea&s;t&mdash;I am &s;ure I mean it."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now grew a little di&s;turbed; &s;he looked at Mrs. Harrel, who &s;eemed al&s;o unea&s;y, and then, with &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Have you really never, Sir, employed this man before?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never in my life: never any but old Aaron. I dread the whole race; I have a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;titious notion that if once I get into their clutches, I &s;hall never be my own
<PB N="36" REF="35">
man again; and that induced me to beg your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. However, 'tis no great matter."</Q></P>
<P>She then began to waver; &s;he feared there might be future mi&s;chief as well as pre|&s;ent inconvenience, in his applying to new u&s;urers, and knowing &s;he had now the pow|er to prevent him, thought her&s;elf half cruel in refu&s;ing to exert it. She wi&s;hed to con|&s;ult Mr. Monckton, but found it nece&s;&s;ary to take her mea&s;ures immediately, as the Jew was already &s;ent for, and mu&s;t in a few moments be either employed or di&s;carded.</P>
<P>Much perplext how to act, between a de&s;ire of doing good, and a fear of encou|raging evil, &s;he weighed each &s;ide ha&s;tily, but while &s;till uncertain which ought to preponderate, her kindne&s;s for Mrs. Harrel interfered, and, in the hope of re&s;cuing her hu&s;band from further bad practices, &s;he &s;aid &s;he would po&s;tpone her own bu&s;ine&s;s for the few days he mentioned, rather than &s;ee him compelled to open any new account with &s;o dangerous a &s;et of men.</P>
<P>He thanked her in his u&s;ual negligent manner, and accepting the 200<HI>l.</HI> gave her his receipt for it, and a promi&s;e &s;he &s;hould be paid in a week.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, however, &s;eemed more grate|ful, and with many embraces &s;poke her &s;en&s;e of this friendly good nature. Cecilia, happy
<PB N="37" REF="36">
from believing &s;he had revived in her &s;ome &s;park of &s;en&s;ibility, determined to avail her&s;elf of &s;o favourable a &s;ymptom, and en|ter at once upon the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k &s;he had &s;et her&s;elf, of repre&s;enting to her the danger of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as breakfa&s;t was done, and Mr. Arnott, who came in before it was over, was gone, with a view to excite her attention by rai&s;ing her curio&s;ity, &s;he beg|ged the favour of a private conference in her own room, upon matters of &s;ome im|portance.</P>
<P>She began with hoping that the friend&s;hip in which they had &s;o long lived would make her pardon the liberty &s;he was going to take, and which nothing le&s;s than their former in|timacy, joined to &s;trong apprehen&s;ions for her future welfare, could authori&s;e; <Q REND="inline">"But oh Pri&s;cilla!"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"with open eyes to &s;ee your danger, yet not warn you of it, would be a re&s;erve treacherous in a friend, and cruel even in a fellow-creature."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What danger?"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, much alarmed, <Q REND="inline">"do you think me ill? do I look con&s;umptive?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, con&s;umptive indeed!"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"but not, I hope, in your con&s;titution."</Q></P>
<P>And then, with all the tenderne&s;s in her power, &s;he came to the point, and conjured her without delay to retrench her expences,
<PB N="38" REF="37">
and change her thoughtle&s;s way of life for one more con&s;iderate and dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, with much &s;implicity, a&s;|fured her <HI>&s;he did nothing but what every body el&s;e did,</HI> and that it was quite impo&s;&s;ible for her to <HI>appear in the world</HI> in any other manner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how are you to appear hereafter?"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if now you live beyond your income, you mu&s;t con&s;ider that in time your income by &s;uch depredations will be exhau&s;ted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I declare to you,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"I never run in debt for more than half a year, for as &s;oon as I receive my own money, I generally pay it away every &s;hilling: and &s;o borrow what I want till pay day comes round again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And that,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;eems a method expre&s;sly devi&s;ed for keeping you eternally comfortle&s;s: pardon me, however, for &s;peaking &s;o openly, but I fear Mr. Har|rel him&s;elf mu&s;t be even &s;till le&s;s attentive and accurate in his affairs, or he could not &s;o frequently be embarra&s;&s;ed. And what is to be the re&s;ult? look but, my dear Pri&s;cilla, a little forward, and you will tremble at the pro&s;pect before you!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel &s;eemed frightened at this &s;peech, and begged to know what &s;he would have them do?</P>
<P>Cecilia then, with equal wi&s;dom and
<PB N="39" REF="38">
friendline&s;s, propo&s;ed a general reform in the hou&s;hold, the public and private ex|pences of both: &s;he advi&s;ed that a &s;trict examination might be made into the &s;tate of their affairs, that all their bills &s;hould be called in, and faithfully paid, and that an entire new plan of life &s;hould be adopted, according to the &s;ituation of their fortune and income when cleared of all in|cumbrances.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, my dear!"</Q> exclaimed Mrs. Harrel, with a look of a&s;toni&s;hment, <Q REND="inline">"why Mr. Harrel would no more do all this than fly! If I was only to make &s;uch a propo&s;al, I dare &s;ay he would laugh in my face."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why?&mdash;why becau&s;e it would &s;eem &s;uch an odd thing&mdash;it's what nobody thinks of&mdash;though I am &s;ure I am very much ob|liged to you for mentioning it.&mdash;Shall we go down &s;tairs? I think I heard &s;omebody come in."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No matter who comes in,"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"reflect for a moment upon my pro|po&s;al, and, at lea&s;t, if you di&s;approve it, &s;ugge&s;t &s;omething more eligible."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, it's a very good propo&s;al, that I agree,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel, looking very weary," <Q REND="inline">but only the thing is it's quite im|po&s;&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
<Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o? why is it impo&s;&s;ible?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why becau&s;e&mdash;dear, I don't know&mdash;but I am &s;ure it is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what is your rea&s;on? What makes you &s;ure of it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, I can't tell&mdash;but I know it is&mdash;becau&s;e&mdash;I am very certain it is."</Q></P>
<P>Argument &s;uch as this, though extreme|ly fatiguing to the under&s;tanding of Cecilia, had yet no power to <HI>blunt her purpo&s;e:</HI> &s;he warmly expo&s;tulated again&s;t the weakne&s;s of her de&s;ence, &s;trongly repre&s;ented the imprudence of her conduct, and exhorted her by every tie of ju&s;tice, honour and di&s;|cretion to &s;et about a reformation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what can I do?"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, impatiently, <Q REND="inline">"one mu&s;t live a little like other people. You would not have me be &s;tared at, I &s;uppo&s;e; and I am &s;ure I don't know what I do that every body el&s;e does not do too."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But were it not better,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, with more energy, <Q REND="inline">"to think le&s;s of <HI>other people,</HI> and more of <HI>your&s;elf?</HI> to con&s;ult your own fortune, and your own &s;ituation in life, in&s;tead of being blindly guided by tho&s;e of <HI>other people?</HI> If, indeed, <HI>other people</HI> would be re&s;pon&s;ible for your lo&s;&s;es, for the dimi|nution of your wealth, and for the di&s;order of your affairs, then might you rationally
<PB N="41" REF="40">
make their way of life the example of yours: but you cannot flatter your&s;elf &s;uch will be the ca&s;e; you know better; your lo&s;&s;es, your dimini&s;hed fortune, your embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances will be all your own! pitied, perhaps, by &s;ome, but blamed by more, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by none!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Lord, Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, &s;tarting, <Q REND="inline">"you talk ju&s;t as if we were ruined!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mean not that,"</Q> replied Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but I would fain, by pointing out your danger, prevail with you to prevent in time &s;o dreadful a cata&s;trophe."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, more affronted than alarmed, heard this an&s;wer with much di&s;plea&s;ure, and after a &s;ullen he&s;itation, peevi&s;hly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t own I don't take it very kind of you to &s;ay &s;uch frightful things to me; I am &s;ure we only live like the re&s;t of the world, and I don't &s;ee why a man of Mr. Harrel's fortune &s;hould live any wor&s;e. As to his having now and then a little debt or two, it is nothing but what every body el&s;e has. You only think it &s;o odd, becau&s;e you a'n't u&s;ed to it: but you are quite mi&s;taken if you &s;uppo&s;e he does not mean to pay, for he told me this morning that as &s;oon as ever he receives his rents, he intends to di&s;charge every bill he has in the world."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">
<Q REND="inline">"I am very glad to hear it,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and I heartily wi&s;h he may have the re&s;olution to adhere to his purpo&s;e. I feared you would think me impertinent, but you do wor&s;e in believing me unkind: friend&s;hip and good-will could alone have induced me to hazard what I have &s;aid to you. I mu&s;t, however, have done; though I cannot forbear adding that I hope what has already pa&s;&s;ed will &s;ometimes recur to you."</Q></P>
<P>They then &s;eparated; Mrs. Harrel half angry at remon&s;trances &s;he thought only cen&s;orious, and Cecilia offended at her pet|ti&s;hne&s;s and folly, though grieved at her blindne&s;s.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon, however, recompen&s;ed for this vexation by a vi&s;it from Mrs. Delvile, who, finding her alone, &s;at with her &s;ome time, and by her &s;pirit, under&s;tanding and elegance, di&s;&s;ipated all her chagrin.</P>
<P>From another circum&s;tance, al&s;o, &s;he re|ceived much plea&s;ure, though a little per|plexity; Mr. Arnott brought her word that Mr. Belfield, almo&s;t quite well, had actually left his lodgings, and was gone into the country.</P>
<P>She now half &s;u&s;pected that the account of his illne&s;s given her by young Delvile, was merely the effect of his curio&s;ity to di&s;|cover her &s;entiments of him; yet when &s;he
<PB N="43" REF="42">
con&s;idered how foreign to his character appeared every &s;pecies of artifice, &s;he excul|pated him from the de&s;ign, and concluded that the impatient &s;pirit of Belfield had hurried him away, when really unfit for travelling. She had no means, however, to hear more of him now he had quitted the town, and therefore, though unea&s;y, &s;he was compelled to be patient.</P>
<P>In the evening &s;he had again a vi&s;it from Mr. Monckton, who, though he was now acquainted how much &s;he was at home, had the forbearance to avoid making frequent u&s;e of that knowledge, that his attendance might e&s;cape ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Cecilia, as u&s;ual, &s;poke to him of all her affairs with the utmo&s;t openne&s;s; and as her mind was now chiefly occupied by her apprehen&s;ions for the Harrels, &s;he com|municated to him the extravagance of which they were guilty, and hinted at the di&s;tre&s;s that from time to time it occa&s;ioned; but the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had afforded them her own delicacy prevented her mentioning.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton &s;crupled not from this account in&s;tantly to pronounce Harrel a <HI>ruined man;</HI> and thinking Cecilia, from her connection with him, in much danger of being involved in his future difficulties, he mo&s;t earne&s;tly exhorted her to &s;uffer no inducement to prevail with her to advance
<PB N="44" REF="43">
him any money, confidently affirming &s;he would have little chance of being ever repaid.</P>
<P>Cecilia li&s;tened to this charge with much alarm, but readily promi&s;ed future circum|&s;pection. She confe&s;&s;ed to him the con|ference &s;he had had in the morning with Mrs. Harrel, and after lamenting her de|termined neglect of her affairs, &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot but own that my e&s;teem for her, even more than my affection, has le&s;&s;ened almo&s;t every day &s;ince I have been in her hou&s;e; but this morning, when I ventured to &s;peak to her with earne&s;tne&s;s, I found her powers of rea&s;oning &s;o weak, and her infatuation to luxury and expence &s;o &s;trong, that I have ever &s;ince felt a&s;hamed of my own want of di&s;cernment in having for|merly &s;elected her for my friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When you gave her that title,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"you had little choice in your power; her &s;weetne&s;s and good-nature attracted you; childhood is never troubled with fore&s;ight, and youth is &s;eldom difficult: &s;he was lively and plea&s;ing, you were gene|rous and affectionate; your a quaintance with her was formed while you were yet too young to know your own worth, your fond|ne&s;s of her grew from habit, and before the inferiority or her parts had weakened your regard, by offending your judgment, her
<PB N="45" REF="44">
early marriage &s;eparated you from her en|tirely. But now you meet again the &s;cene is altered; three years of ab&s;ence &s;pent in the cultivation of an under&s;tanding natu|rally of the fir&s;t order, by encrea&s;ing your wi&s;dom, has made you more fa&s;tidious; while the &s;ame time &s;pent by her in mere idlene&s;s and &s;hew, has hurt her di&s;po&s;ition, without adding to her knowledge, and rob|bed her of her natural excellencies, without enriching her with acquired ones. You &s;ee her now with impartiality, for you &s;ee her almo&s;t as a &s;tranger, and all tho&s;e defi|ciencies which retirement and inexperience had formerly concealed, her vanity, and her &s;uperficial acquaintance with the world, have now rendered glaring. But folly weakens all bands. remember, therefore, if you would form a &s;olid friend&s;hip, to con&s;ult not only the heart but the head, not only the temper, but the under&s;tand|ing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"at lea&s;t it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed I have judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en <HI>you!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have, indeed, done me the highe&s;t honour,"</Q> he an&s;wered.</P>
<P>They then talked of Belfield, and Mr. Monckton confirmed the account of Mr. Arnott, that he had left London in good
<PB N="46" REF="45">
health. After which, he enquired if &s;he had &s;een any thing more of the Delviles?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Delvile called upon me this morning. She is a delightful woman; I am &s;orry you know her not enough to do her ju&s;tice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is &s;he civil to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Civil? &s;he is all kindne&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then depend upon it &s;he has &s;ome|thing in view: whenever that is not the ca&s;e, &s;he is all in&s;olence. And Mr. Del|vile,&mdash;pray what do you think of him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I think him in&s;ufferable! and I cannot &s;ufficiently thank you for that timely caution which prevented my change of habitation. I would not live under the &s;ame roof with him for the world!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, and do you not now begin al&s;o to &s;ee the &s;on properly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Properly? I don't under&s;tand you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why as the very &s;on of &s;uch pa|rents, haughty and impertinent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed; he has not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance of his father, and if he re|&s;embles his mother, it is only what every one mu&s;t wi&s;h who impartially &s;ees her.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know not that family. But how, indeed, &s;hould you, when they are in a combination to prevent your getting that knowledge? They have all their de&s;igns
<PB N="47" REF="46">
upon you, and if you are not carefully upon your guard, you will be the dupe to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What can you po&s;&s;ibly mean?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing but what every body el&s;e mu&s;t immediately &s;ee; they have a great &s;hare of pride, and a &s;mall one of wealth; you &s;eem by fortune to be flung in their way, and doubtle&s;s they mean not to neglect &s;o inviting an opportunity of repairing their e&s;tates."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed you are mi&s;taken; I am certain they have no &s;uch intention: on the contrary, they all even teazingly per|&s;i&s;t in thinking me already engaged el&s;e|where."</Q></P>
<P>She then gave him a hi&s;tory of their &s;everal &s;u&s;picions. <Q REND="inline">"The impertinence of report,"</Q> &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"has &s;o much con|vinced them that Sir Robert Floyer and Mr. Belfield fought merely as rivals, that I can only clear my&s;elf of partiality for one of them, to have it in&s;tantly concluded I feel it for the other. And, far from &s;eeming hurt that I appear to be di&s;po&s;ed of, Mr. Delvile openly &s;econds the preten&s;ions of Sir Robert, and his &s;on officiou&s;ly per&s;uades me that I am already Mr. Belfield's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tricks, nothing but tricks to di&s;cover your real &s;ituation."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47">
He then gave her &s;ome general cautions to be upon her guard again&s;t their artifices, and changing the &s;ubject, talked, for the re&s;t of his vi&s;it, upon matters of general entertainment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. AN EVASION.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA now for about a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed her time without incident: the Harrels continued their accu&s;tomed di&s;&s;ipa|tion, Sir Robert Floyer, without even &s;eek|ing a private conference, per&s;evered in his attentions, and Mr. Arnott, though &s;till &s;ilent and humble, &s;eemed only to live by the plea&s;ure of beholding her. She &s;pent two whole days with Mrs. Delvile, both of which &s;erved to con&s;irm her admiration of that lady and of her &s;on; and &s;he joined the parties of the Harrels, or &s;tayed quietly at home, according to her &s;pirits and inclina|tions: while &s;he was vi&s;ited by Mr. Monck|ton often enough to &s;atisfy him with her proceedings, yet too &s;eldom to betray ei|ther to her&s;elf or to the world any &s;u&s;picion of his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Her 200<HI>l.</HI> however, which was to have been returned at the end of the fir&s;t week, though a fortnight was now elap&s;ed, had not even been mentioned: &s;he began to grow very impatient, but not knowing what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue, and wanting courage to
<PB N="50" REF="49">
remind Mr. Harrel of his promi&s;e, &s;he &s;till waited the performance of it without &s;peak|ing.</P>
<P>At this time, preparations were making in the family for removing to Violet-bank to &s;pend the Ea&s;ter holidays: but Cecilia, who was too much grieved at &s;uch perpetual encrea&s;e of unnece&s;&s;ary expences to have any enjoyment in new pro&s;pects of enter|tainment, had at pre&s;ent &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of her own which gave her full employment.</P>
<P>The poor carpenter, who&s;e family &s;he had taken under her protection, was ju&s;t dead, and, as &s;oon as the la&s;t duties had been paid him, &s;he &s;ent for his widow, and after trying to con&s;ole her for the lo&s;s &s;he had &s;uffered, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he was immediately ready to fulfil the engagement into which &s;he had entered, of a&s;&s;i&s;ting her to under|take &s;ome better method of procuring a livelihood; and therefore de&s;ired to know in what manner &s;he could &s;erve her, and what &s;he thought her&s;elf able to do.</P>
<P>The good woman, pouring forth thanks and prai&s;es innumerable, an&s;wered that &s;he had a Cou&s;in, who had offered, for a cer|tain premium, to take her into partner&s;hip in a &s;mall haberda&s;her's &s;hop. <Q REND="inline">"But then, madam,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"it's quite mo|rally impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;um, or el&s;e, to be &s;ure, &s;uch a &s;hop as that, now
<PB N="51" REF="50">
I am grown &s;o poorly, would be quite a hea|ven upon earth to me: for my &s;trength, madam, is almo&s;t all gone away, and when I do any hard work, it's quite a piteous &s;ight to &s;ee me, for I am all in a tremble after it, ju&s;t as if I had an ague, and yet all the time my hands, madam, will be burning like a coal!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have indeed been overworked,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and it is high time your feeble frame &s;hould have &s;ome re&s;t. What is the &s;um your cou&s;in demands?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O madam, more than I &s;hould be able to get together in all my life! for earn what I will, it goes as fa&s;t as it comes, becau&s;e there's many mouths, and &s;mall pay, and two of the little ones that can't help at all;&mdash;and there's no Billy, madam, to work for us now!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But tell me, what is the &s;um?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sixty pound, madam."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall have it!"</Q> cried the generous Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if the &s;ituation will make you happy, I will give it you my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>The poor woman wept her thanks, and was long before &s;he could &s;ufficiently com|po&s;e her&s;elf to an&s;wer the further que&s;tions of Cecilia, who next enquired what could be done with the children? Mrs. Hill, however, hitherto hopele&s;s of &s;uch a pro|vi&s;ion for her&s;elf, had for them formed no
<PB N="52" REF="51">
plan. She told her, therefore, to go to her cou&s;in, and con&s;ult upon this &s;ubject, as well as to make preparations for her own removal.</P>
<P>The arrangement of this bu&s;ine&s;s now became her favourite occupation. She went her&s;elf to the &s;hop, which was a very &s;mall one in Fetter-lane, and &s;poke with Mrs. Roberts, the cou&s;in; who agreed to take the elde&s;t girl, now &s;ixteen years of age, by way of helper; but &s;aid &s;he had room for no other: however, upon Cecilia's offering to rai&s;e the premium, &s;he con&s;ented that the two little children &s;hould al&s;o live in the hou&s;e, where they might be under the care of their mother and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>There were &s;till two others to be di&s;po&s;|ed of; but as no immediate method of pro|viding for them occurred to Cecilia, &s;he de|termined, for the pre&s;ent, to place them in &s;ome cheap &s;chool, where they might be taught plain work, which could not but prove a u&s;eful qualification for whatever &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s they might hereafter attempt.</P>
<P>Her plan was to be&s;tow upon Mrs. Hill and her children 100<HI>l.</HI> by way of putting them all into a decent way of living; and then, from time to time, to make them &s;uch &s;mall pre&s;ents as their future exigencies or changes of &s;ituation might require.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, payment from Mr. Har|rel
<PB N="53" REF="52">
became immediately nece&s;&s;ary, for &s;he had only 50<HI>l.</HI> of the 600<HI>l.</HI> &s;he had taken up in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and her cu&s;tomary al|lowance was already &s;o appropriated that &s;he could make from it no con&s;iderable de|duction.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in the &s;ight of labo|rious indigence &s;o affecting and &s;o re&s;pec|table, that it renders di&s;&s;ipation peculiarly contemptible, and doubles the odium of extravagance: every time Cecilia &s;aw this poor family, her aver&s;ion to the conduct and the principles of Mr. Harrel encrea&s;ed, while her delicacy of &s;hocking or &s;haming him dimini&s;hed, and &s;he &s;oon acquired for them what &s;he had failed to acquire for her&s;elf, the &s;pirit and re&s;olution to claim her debt.</P>
<P>One morning, therefore, as he was quit|ting the breakfa&s;t-room, &s;he ha&s;tily aro&s;e, and following, begged to have a moment's di&s;cour&s;e with him. They went together to the library, and after &s;ome apologies, and much he&s;itation, &s;he told him &s;he fan|cied he had forgotten the 200<HI>l.</HI> which &s;he had lent him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The 200<HI>l.</HI>"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"O, ay, true!&mdash;I prote&s;t it had e&s;caped me. Well, but you don't want it immediately?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I do, if you can conveniently &s;pare it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53">
<Q REND="inline">"O yes, certainly!&mdash;without the lea&s;t doubt!&mdash;Though now I think of it&mdash;its ex|tremely unlucky, but really ju&s;t at this time&mdash;why did not you put me in mind of it before?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hoped you would have remembered it your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could have paid you two days ago extremely well&mdash;however, you &s;hall cer|tainly have it very &s;oon, that you may de|pend upon, and a day or two can make no great difference to you."</Q></P>
<P>He then wi&s;hed her good morning, and left her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, very much provoked, regretted that &s;he had ever lent it at all, and deter|mined for the future &s;trictly to follow the advice of Mr. Monckton in tru&s;ting him no more.</P>
<P>Two or three days pa&s;&s;ed on, but &s;till no notice was taken either of the payment or of the debt. She then re&s;olved to renew her application, and be more &s;erious and more urgent with him; but &s;he found, to her utter &s;urpri&s;e, this was not in her pow|er, and that though &s;he lived under the &s;ame roof with him, &s;he had no opportu|nity to enforce her claim. Mr. Harrel, whenever &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, prote&s;ted he was &s;o much hurried he had not a moment to &s;pare: and even when,
<PB N="55" REF="54">
tired of his excu&s;es, &s;he pur&s;ued him out of the room, he only quickened his &s;peed, &s;miling, however, and bowing, and calling out <Q REND="inline">"I am va&s;tly &s;orry, but I am &s;o late now I cannot &s;top an in&s;tant; however, as &s;oon as I come back, I &s;hall be wholly at your command."</Q></P>
<P>When he came back, however, Sir Ro|bert Floyer, or &s;ome other gentleman, was &s;ure to be with him, and the difficulties of obtaining an audience were &s;ure to be en|crea&s;ed. And by this method, which he con&s;tantly practi&s;ed, of avoiding any pri|vate conver&s;ation, he fru&s;trated all her &s;chemes of remon&s;trating upon his delay, &s;ince her re&s;entment, however great, could never urge her to the indelicacy of dunning him in pre&s;ence of a third per&s;on.</P>
<P>She was now much perplext her&s;elf how to put into execution her plan for the Hills: &s;he knew it would be as vain to apply for money to Mr. Briggs, as for payment to Mr. Harrel. Her word, however, had been given, and her word &s;he held &s;acred: &s;he re&s;olved, therefore, for the pre&s;ent, to be|&s;tow upon them the 50<HI>l.</HI> &s;he &s;till retained, and, if the re&s;t &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary before &s;he became of age, to &s;pare it, however in|conveniently, from her private allowance, which, by the will of her uncle, was 500<HI>l.</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="55">
a year, 250<HI>l.</HI> of which Mr. Harrel received for her board and accommodations.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled this matter in her own mind, &s;he went to the lodging of Mrs. Hill, in order to conclude the affair. She found her and all her children, except the young|e&s;t, hard at work, and their hone&s;t indu&s;|try &s;o much &s;trengthened her compa&s;&s;ion, that her wi&s;hes for &s;erving them grew every in&s;tant more liberal.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hill readily undertook to make her cou&s;in accept half the premium for the pre|&s;ent, which would &s;uffice to fix her, with three of her children, in the &s;hop: Cecilia then went with her to Fetter-lane, and there, drawing up her&s;elf an agreement for their entering into partner&s;hip, &s;he made each of them &s;ign it and take a copy, and kept a third in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: after which, &s;he gave a promi&s;&s;ory note to Mrs. Roberts for the re&s;t of the money.</P>
<P>She pre&s;ented Mrs. Hill, al&s;o, with 10<HI>l.</HI> to clothe them all decently, and enable her to &s;end two of the children to &s;chool; and a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he would her&s;elf pay for their board and in&s;truction, till &s;he &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in her bu&s;ine&s;s, and have power to &s;ave money for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>She then put her&s;elf into a chair to return home, followed by the prayers and ble&s;|&s;ings of the whole family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. AN ADVENTURE.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER had the heart of Cecilia felt &s;o light, &s;o gay, &s;o glowing as after the tran&s;action of this affair: her life had never appeared to her &s;o important, nor her wealth &s;o valuable. To &s;ee five helple&s;s children provided for by her&s;elf, re&s;cued from the extremes of penury and wretched|ne&s;s, and put in a way to become u&s;eful to &s;ociety, and comfortable to them&s;elves; to behold their feeble mother, &s;natched from the hard&s;hip of that labour which, over|powering her &s;trength, had almo&s;t de&s;troy|ed her exi&s;tence, now placed in a &s;ituation where a competent maintenance might be earned without fatigue, and the remnant of her days pa&s;s in ea&s;y employment&mdash;to view &s;uch &s;ights, and have power to &s;ay <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The&s;e deeds are mine!</HI>"</Q> what, to a di&s;po&s;i|tion fraught with tenderne&s;s and benevo|lence, could give purer &s;elf-applau&s;e, or more exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction?</P>
<P>Such were the plea&s;ures which regaled the reflections of Cecilia when, in her way
<PB N="58" REF="57">
home, having got out of her chair to walk through the upper part of Oxford Street, &s;he was &s;uddenly met by the old gentleman who&s;e emphatical addre&s;&s;es to her had &s;o much excited her a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>He was pa&s;&s;ing quick on, but &s;topping the moment he perceived her, he &s;ternly called out <Q REND="inline">"Are you proud? are you cal|lous? are you hard of heart &s;o &s;oon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Put me, if you plea&s;e, to &s;ome trial!"</Q> cried Cecilia, with the virtuous courage of a &s;elf-acquitting con&s;cience.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I already have!"</Q> returned he, indig|nantly, <Q REND="inline">"and already I have found you faulty!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry to hear it,"</Q> &s;aid the amaz|ed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but at lea&s;t I hope you will tell me in what?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You refu&s;ed me admittance,"</Q> he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"yet I was your friend, yet I was willing to prolong the term of your ge|nuine tranquility! I pointed out to you a method of pre&s;erving peace with your own &s;oul; I came to you in behalf of the poor, and in&s;tructed you how to merit their pray|ers; you heard me, you were &s;u&s;ceptible, you complied! I meant to have repeated the le&s;&s;on, to have tuned your whole heart to compa&s;&s;ion, and to have taught you the &s;ad duties of &s;ympathi&s;ing humanity. For
<PB N="59" REF="58">
this purpo&s;e I called again, but again I was not admitted! Short was the period of my ab&s;ence, yet long enough for the comple|tion of your downfall!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"how dreadful is this language! when have you called, Sir? I never heard you had been at the hou&s;e. Far from refu&s;ing you ad|mittance, I wi&s;hed to &s;ee you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed?"</Q> cried he, with &s;ome &s;oft|ne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"and are you, in truth, not proud? not callous? not hard of heart? Follow me, then, and vi&s;it the humble and the poor, follow me, and give comfort to the fallen and dejected!"</Q></P>
<P>At this invitation, however de&s;irous to do good, Cecilia &s;tarted; the &s;trangene&s;s of the inviter, his flightine&s;s, his authoritative manner, and the uncertainty whither or to whom he might carry her, made her fear|ful of proceeding: yet a benevolent curio|&s;ity to &s;ee as well as &s;erve the objects of his recommendation, joined to the eagerne&s;s of youthful integrity to clear her own charac|ter from the a&s;per&s;ion of hard-heartedne&s;s, &s;oon conquered her irre&s;olution, and, ma|king a &s;ign to her &s;ervant to keep near her, &s;he followed as her conductor led.</P>
<P>He went on &s;ilently and &s;olemnly till he came to Swallow-&s;treet, then turning into it, he &s;topt at a &s;mall and mean-looking
<PB N="60" REF="59">
hou&s;e, knocked at the door, and without a&s;king any que&s;tion of the man who opened it, beckoned her to come after him, and ha&s;tened up &s;ome narrow winding &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Cecilia again he&s;itated; but when &s;he re|collected that this old man, though little known, was frequently &s;een, and though with few people acquainted, was by many per&s;onally recognized, &s;he thought it im|po&s;&s;ible he could mean her any injury. She ordered her &s;ervant, however, to come in, and bid him keep walking up and down the &s;tairs till &s;he returned to him. And then &s;he obeyed the directions of her guide.</P>
<P>He proceeded till he came to the &s;econd floor, then, again beckoning her to follow him, he opened a door, and entered a &s;mall and very meanly furni&s;hed apart|ment.</P>
<P>And here, to her infinite a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;he perceived, employed in wa&s;hing &s;ome china, a very lovely young woman, gen|teely dre&s;&s;ed, and appearing hardly &s;even|teen years of age.</P>
<P>The moment they came in, with evident marks of confu&s;ion, &s;he in&s;tantly gave over her work, ha&s;tily putting the ba&s;on &s;he was wa&s;hing upon the table, and endeavouring to hide the towel with which &s;he was wip|ing it behind her chair.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, advancing to her
<PB N="61" REF="60">
with quickne&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How is he now? Is he better? will he live?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid he &s;hould not!"</Q> an|&s;wered the young woman with emotion, <Q REND="inline">"but, indeed, he is no better!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Look here,"</Q> &s;aid he, pointing to Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"I have brought you one who has power to &s;erve you, and to relieve your di&s;tre&s;s: one who is rolling in affluence, a &s;tranger to ill, a novice in the world;&mdash;un&s;killed in the mi&s;eries &s;he is yet to en|dure, uncon&s;cious of the depravity into which &s;he is to &s;ink! receive her bene|factions while yet &s;he is untainted, &s;atisfied that while &s;he aids you, &s;he is ble&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>The young woman, blu&s;hing and aba&s;hed, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are very good to me, Sir, but there is no occa&s;ion&mdash;there is no need&mdash;I have not any nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;I am far from being &s;o very much in want.&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor &s;imple &s;oul!"</Q> interrupted the old man, <Q REND="inline">"and art thou a&s;hamed of po|verty? Guard, guard thy&s;elf from other &s;hames, and the wealthie&s;t may envy thee! Tell here thy &s;tory, plainly, roundly, truly; abate nothing of thy indigence, repre&s;s nothing of her liberality. The Poor not impoveri&s;hed by their own Guilt, are Equals of the Affluent, not enriched by their own Virtue. Come, then, and let
<PB N="62" REF="61">
me pre&s;ent ye to each other! young as ye both are, with many years and many &s;or|rows to encounter, lighten the burthen of each other's cares, by the heart-&s;oothing exchange of gratitude for beneficence!"</Q></P>
<P>He then took a hand of each, and join|ing them between his own, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>You,</HI>"</Q> he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"who though rich, are not har|dened, and <HI>you,</HI> who though poor, are not deba&s;ed, why &s;hould ye not love, why &s;hould ye not cheri&s;h each other? The afflictions of life are tedious, its joys are evane&s;cent; ye are now both young, and, with little to enjoy, will find much to &s;uffer. Ye are both, too, I believe, inno|cent&mdash;Oh could ye always remain &s;o!&mdash;Cherubs were ye then, and the &s;ons of men might wor&s;hip you!"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt, checked by his own ri&s;ing emotion; but &s;oon re&s;uming his u&s;ual au&s;terity, <Q REND="inline">"Such, however,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"is not the condition of humanity; in pity, therefore, to the evils impending over both, be kind to each other! I leave you together, and to your mutual tenderne&s;s I recommend you!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, turning particularly to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Di&s;dain not,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"to con&s;ole the depre&s;&s;ed; look upon her without &s;corn, conver&s;e with her without contempt: like you, &s;he is an orphan, though not like you,
<PB N="63" REF="62">
an heire&s;s;&mdash;like her, you are fatherle&s;s, though not like her friendle&s;s! If &s;he is awaited by the temptations of adver&s;ity, you, al&s;o, are &s;urrounded by the cor|ruptions of pro&s;perity. Your fall is mo&s;t probable, her's mo&s;t excu&s;able;&mdash;commi|&s;erate <HI>her</HI> therefore now,&mdash;by and by &s;he may commi&s;erate <HI>you!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>And with the&s;e words he left the room.</P>
<P>A total &s;ilence for &s;ome time &s;ucceeded his departure: Cecilia found it difficult to recover from the &s;urpri&s;e into which &s;he had been thrown &s;ufficiently for &s;peech: in following her extraordinary director, her imagination had painted to her a &s;cene &s;uch as &s;he had &s;o lately quitted, and prepared her to behold &s;ome family in di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ome helple&s;s creature in &s;ickne&s;s, or &s;ome chil|dren in want; but of the&s;e to &s;ee none, to meet but one per&s;on, and that one fair, young, and delicate,&mdash;an introduction &s;o &s;ingular to an object &s;o unthought of, de|prived her of all power but that of &s;hewing her amazement.</P>
<P>Mean while the young woman looked &s;carcely le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, and in&s;initely more embarra&s;&s;ed. She &s;urveyed her apartment with vexation, and her gue&s;t with con|fu&s;ion; &s;he had li&s;tened to the exhortation of the old man with vi&s;ible unea&s;ine&s;s, and
<PB N="64" REF="63">
now he was gone, &s;eemed overwhelmed with &s;hame and chagrin.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who in ob&s;erving the&s;e emotions felt both her curio&s;ity and her compa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;e, pre&s;&s;ed her hand as &s;he parted with it, and, when a little recovered, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t think this a &s;trange intru&s;ion; but the gentleman who brought me hither is perhaps &s;o well known to you, as to make his &s;ingularities plead with you their own apology."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, madam,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, ba&s;hfully, <Q REND="inline">"he is very little known to me; but he is very good, and very de&s;irous to do me &s;ervice:&mdash;not but what I believe he thinks me much wor&s;e off than I really am, for, I a&s;&s;ure you, madam, whatever he has &s;aid, I am not ill off at all&mdash;hardly."</Q></P>
<P>The various doubts to her di&s;advantage which had at fir&s;t, from her uncommon &s;ituation, ari&s;en in the mind of Cecilia, this anxiety to di&s;gui&s;e, not di&s;play her di&s;tre&s;s, con&s;iderably removed, &s;ince it cleared her of all &s;u&s;picion of &s;eeking by artifice and impo&s;ition to play upon her feelings.</P>
<P>With a gentlene&s;s, therefore, the mo&s;t &s;oothing, &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould by no means have broken in upon you thus unex|pectedly, if I had not concluded my con|ductor had &s;ome right to bring me. How|ever,
<PB N="65" REF="64">
&s;ince we are actually met, let us remember his injunctions, and endeavour not to part till, by a mutual exchange of good-will, each has added a friend to the other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are conde&s;cending indeed, ma|dam,"</Q> an&s;wered the young woman, with an air the mo&s;t humble, <Q REND="inline">"looking as you look, to talk of a friend when you come to &s;uch a place as this! up two pair of &s;tairs! no furniture! no &s;ervant! every thing in &s;uch di&s;order!&mdash;indeed I wonder at Mr. Albany! he &s;hould not&mdash;but he thinks every body's affairs may be made public, and does not care what he tells, nor who hears him;&mdash;he knows not the pain he gives, nor the mi&s;chief he may do."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very much concerned,"</Q> cried Cecilia, more and more &s;urpri&s;ed at all &s;he heard, <Q REND="inline">"to find I have been thus in&s;tru|mental to di&s;tre&s;&s;ing you. I was ignorant whither I was coming, and followed him, believe me, neither from curio&s;ity nor in|clination, but &s;imply becau&s;e I knew not how to refu&s;e him. He is gone, however, and I will therefore relieve you by going too: but permit me to leave behind me a &s;mall te&s;timony that the intention of my coming was not mere impertinence."</Q></P>
<P>She then took out her pur&s;e; but the young woman, &s;tarting back with a look
<PB N="66" REF="65">
of re&s;entful mortification, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"No, madam! you are quite mi&s;taken; pray put up your pur&s;e; I am no beggar! Mr. Al|bany has mi&s;repre&s;ented me, if he has told you I am."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, mortified in her turn at this unexpected rejection of an offer &s;he had thought her&s;elf invited to make, &s;tood &s;ome moments &s;ilent; and then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am far from meaning to offend you, and I &s;incerely beg your pardon if I have mi&s;under&s;tood the charge ju&s;t now given to me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have nothing to pardon, madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, more calmly, <Q REND="inline">"except, indeed, to Mr. Albany; and to him, 'tis of no u&s;e to be angry, for he minds not what I &s;ay! he is very good, but he is very &s;trange, for he thinks the whole world made to live in common, and that every one who is poor &s;hould a&s;k, and every one who is rich &s;hould give: he does not know that there are many who would rather &s;tarve."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And are you,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, half|&s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"of that number?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, madam! I have not &s;o much greatne&s;s of mind. But tho&s;e to whom I belong have more fortitude and higher &s;pirit. I wi&s;h I could imitate them!"</Q></P>
<P>Struck with the candour and &s;implicity of this &s;peech, Cecilia now felt a warm
<PB N="67" REF="66">
de&s;ire to &s;erve her, and taking her hand, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Forgive me, but though I &s;ee you wi&s;h me gone, I know not how to leave you: recollect, therefore, the charge that has been given to us both, and if you re|fu&s;e my a&s;&s;i&s;tance one way, point out to me in what other I may offer it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very kind, madam,"</Q> &s;he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"and I dare &s;ay you are very good; I am &s;ure you look &s;o, at lea&s;t. But I want nothing; I do very well, and I have hopes of doing better. Mr. Albany is too impatient. He knows, indeed, that I am not extremely rich, but he is much to blame if he &s;uppo&s;es me therefore an object of charity, and thinks me &s;o mean as to re|ceive money from a &s;tranger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am truly &s;orry,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for the error I have committed, but you mu&s;t &s;uffer me to make my peace with you before we part: yet, till I am better known to you, I am fearful of propo&s;ing terms. Per|haps you will permit me to leave you my direction, and do me the favour to call upon me your&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, madam! I have a &s;ick relation whom I cannot leave: and indeed, if he were well, he would not like to have me make an acquaintance while I am in this place."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope you are not his only nur&s;e?
<PB N="68" REF="67">
I am &s;ure you do not look able to bear &s;uch fatigue. Has he a phy&s;ician? Is he properly attended?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam; he has no phy&s;ician, and no attendance at all!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is it po&s;&s;ible that in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion you can refu&s;e to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted? Surely you &s;hould accept &s;ome help for him, if not for your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what will that &s;ignify when, if I do, he will not make u&s;e of it? and when he had a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times rather die, than let any one know he is in want?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Take it, then, unknown to him; &s;erve him without acquainting him you &s;erve him. Surely you would not &s;uffer him to peri&s;h without aid?"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Is he your father?&mdash;Pardon my que&s;tion, but your youth &s;eems much to want &s;uch a protector."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, I have no father! I was happier when I had! He is my brother."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what is his illne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A fever."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A fever, and without a phy&s;ician! Are you &s;ure, too, it is not infectious?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, too &s;ure!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68">
<Q REND="inline">"Too &s;ure? how &s;o?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I know too well the occa&s;ion of it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what is the occa&s;ion?"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, again taking her hand, <Q REND="inline">"pray tru&s;t me; indeed you &s;hall not repent your con|fidence. Your re&s;erve hitherto has only rai&s;ed you in my e&s;teem, but do not carry it &s;o far as to mortify me by a total re|jection of my good offices."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> &s;aid the young woman, &s;ighing, <Q REND="inline">"you ought to be good, I am &s;ure, for you will draw all out of me by &s;uch kindne&s;s as this! the occa&s;ion was a neglected wound, never properly healed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A wound? is he in the army?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;he was &s;hot through the &s;ide in a duel."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In a duel?"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"pray what is his name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O that I mu&s;t not tell you! his name is a great &s;ecret now, while he is in this poor place, for I know he had almo&s;t rather never &s;ee the light again than have it known."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely, &s;urely,"</Q> cried Cecilia, with much emotion, <Q REND="inline">"he cannot&mdash;I hope he cannot be Mr. Belfield?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah Heaven!"</Q> cried the young wo|man, &s;creaming, <Q REND="inline">"do you then know him?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="69">
Here, in mutual a&s;toni&s;hment, they looked at each other.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Belfield? And Mr. Belfield is thus &s;ick, his wound is not yet healed,&mdash;and he is without any help!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And who, madam, are <HI>you?</HI>"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and how is it you know him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My name is Beverley."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> exclaimed &s;he again, <Q REND="inline">"I fear I have done nothing but mi&s;chief! I know very well who you are now, madam, but if my brother di&s;covers that I have betrayed him, he will take it very unkind, and per|haps never forgive me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be not alarmed,"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"re&s;t a&s;&s;ured he &s;hall never know it. Is he not now in the country?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, he is now in the very next room."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what is become of the &s;urgeon who u&s;ed to attend him, and why does he not &s;till vi&s;it him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is in vain, now, to hide any thing from you; my brother deceived him, and &s;aid he was going out of town merely to get rid of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what could induce him to act &s;o &s;trangely?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A rea&s;on which you, madam, I hope, will never know, Poverty!&mdash;he would not run up a bill he could not pay."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="70">
<Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven!&mdash;But what can be done for him? He mu&s;t not be &s;uffered to linger thus; we mu&s;t contrive &s;ome method of relieving and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, whether he will con&s;ent or not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fear that will not be po&s;&s;ible. One of his friends has already found him out, and has written him the kinde&s;t letter! but he would not an&s;wer it, and would not &s;ee him, and was only fretted and angry."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I will not keep you longer, le&s;t he &s;hould be alarmed by your ab&s;ence. To-morrow morning, with your leave, I will call upon you again, and then, I hope, you will permit me to make &s;ome effort to a&s;&s;i&s;t you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If it only depended upon me, ma|dam,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"now I have the honour to know who you are, I believe I &s;hould not make much &s;cruple, for I was not brought up to notions &s;o high as my brother. Ah! happy had it been for him, for me, for all his family, if he had not had them neither!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then repeated her expre&s;&s;ions of comfort and kindne&s;s, and took her leave.</P>
<P>This little adventure gave her infinite concern; all the horror which the duel had originally occa&s;ioned her, again returned; &s;he accu&s;ed her&s;elf with much bitterne&s;s for having brought it on; and finding that
<PB N="72" REF="71">
Mr. Belfield was &s;o cruelly a &s;ufferer both in his health and his affairs, &s;he thought it incumbent upon her to relieve him to the utmo&s;t of her ability.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter, too, had extremely intere&s;ted her; her youth, and the uncommon art|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of her conver&s;ation, added to her melancholy &s;ituation, and the loveline&s;s of her per&s;on, excited in her a de&s;ire to &s;erve, and an inclination to love her; and &s;he de|termined, if &s;he found her as de&s;erving as &s;he &s;eemed engaging, not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t her at pre&s;ent, but, if her di&s;tre&s;&s;es continued, to receive her into her own hou&s;e in &s;u|ture.</P>
<P>Again &s;he regretted the undue detention of her 200<HI>l.</HI> What &s;he now had to &s;pare was extremely inadequate to what &s;he now wi&s;hed to be&s;tow, and &s;he looked forward to the conclu&s;ion of her minority with en|crea&s;ing eagerne&s;s. The generous and ele|gant plan of life &s;he then intended to pur|&s;ue, daily gained ground in her imagination, and credit in her opinion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A MAN OF GENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, as &s;oon as break|fa&s;t was over, Cecilia went in a chair to Swallow-&s;treet; &s;he enquired for Mi&s;s Belfield, and was told to go up &s;tairs: but what was her amazement to meet, ju&s;t coming out of the room into which &s;he was entering, young Delvile!</P>
<P>They both &s;tarted, and Cecilia, from the &s;eeming &s;trangene&s;s of her &s;ituation, felt a confu&s;ion with which &s;he had hitherto been unacquainted. But Delvile, pre&s;ently re|covering from his &s;urpri&s;e, &s;aid to her, with an expre&s;&s;ive &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"How good is Mi&s;s Beverley thus to vi&s;it the &s;ick! and how much better might I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Mr. Belfield, had I but, by pre|&s;cience, known her de&s;ign, and deferred my own enquiries till he had been revived by hers!"</Q></P>
<P>And then, bowing and wi&s;hing her good morning, he glided pa&s;t her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, notwith&s;tanding the openne&s;s and purity of her intentions, was &s;o much di&s;|concerted by this unexpected meeting, and

<PB N="74" REF="73">
pointed &s;peech, that &s;he had not the pre|&s;ence of mind to call him back and clear her&s;elf: and the various interrogatories and railleries which had already pa&s;&s;ed between them upon the &s;ubject of Mr. Belfield, made her &s;uppo&s;e that what he had formerly &s;u&s;pected he would now think confirmed, and conclude that all her a&s;&s;ertions of in|difference, proceeded merely from that rea|dine&s;s at hypocri&s;y upon particular &s;ubjects, of which he had openly accu&s;ed her whole Sex.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance and this apprehen&s;ion took from her for a while all intere&s;t in the errand upon which &s;he came; but the be|nevolence of her heart &s;oon brought it back, when, upon going into the room, &s;he &s;aw her new favourite in tears.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is the matter?"</Q> cried &s;he, ten|derly; <Q REND="inline">"no new affliction I hope has hap|pened? Your brother is not wor&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, he is much the &s;ame; I was not then crying for him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For what then? tell me, acquaint me with your &s;orrows, and a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf you tell them to a friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was crying, madam, to find &s;o much goodne&s;s in the world, when I thought there was &s;o little! to find I have &s;ome chance of being again happy, when I thought I was mi&s;erable for ever! Two whole years
<PB N="75" REF="74">
have I &s;pent in nothing but unhappine&s;s, and I thought there was nothing el&s;e to be had; but ye&s;terday, madam, brought me <HI>you,</HI> with every promi&s;e of noblene&s;s and protection; and to-day, a friend of my brother's has behaved &s;o generou&s;ly, that even my brother has li&s;tened to him, and almo&s;t con&s;ented to be obliged to him!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And have you already known &s;o much &s;orrow,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that this little dawn of pro&s;perity &s;hould wholly over|power your &s;pirits? Gentle, amiable girl! may the future recompence you for the pa&s;t, and may Mr. Albany's kind wi&s;hes be fulfilled in the reciprocation of our comfort and affection!"</Q></P>
<P>They then entered into a conver&s;ation which the &s;weetne&s;s of Cecilia, and the gra|titude of Mi&s;s Belfield, &s;oon rendered in|tere&s;ting, friendly and unre&s;erved: and in a very &s;hort time, whatever was e&s;&s;ential in the &s;tory or &s;ituation of the latter was fully communicated. She gave, however, a charge the mo&s;t earne&s;t, that her brother &s;hould never be acquainted with the con|fidence &s;he had made.</P>
<P>Her father, who had been dead only two years, was a linen-draper in the city; he had &s;ix daughters, of whom her&s;elf was the younge&s;t, and only one &s;on. This &s;on, Mr. Belfield, was alike the darling of his
<PB N="76" REF="75">
father, mother, and &s;i&s;ters: he was brought up at Eaton, no expence was &s;pared in his education, nothing was denied that could make him happy. With an excellent un|der&s;tanding he had uncommon quickne&s;s of parts, and his progre&s;s in his &s;tudies was rapid and honourable: his father, though he always meant him for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in his bu&s;ine&s;s, heard of his improvement with rapture, often &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"My boy will be the ornament of the city, he will be the be&s;t &s;cholar in any &s;hop in London."</Q></P>
<P>He was &s;oon, however, taught another le&s;&s;on; when, at the age of &s;ixteen, he re|turned home, and was placed in the &s;hop, in&s;tead of applying his talents, as his father had expected, to trade, he both de&s;pi&s;ed and abhorred the name of it; when &s;erious, treating it with contempt, when gay, with deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was &s;eized, al&s;o, with a mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire to fini&s;h his education, like tho&s;e of his &s;chool-fellows who left Eaton at the &s;ame time, at one of the Univer&s;ities; and, after many difficulties, this petition, at the interce&s;&s;ion of his mother, was granted, old Mr. Belfield telling him he hoped a little more learning would give him a little more &s;en&s;e, and that when he became a <HI>fini&s;hed &s;tudent,</HI> he would not only know the true value of bu&s;ine&s;s, but under&s;tand how
<PB N="77" REF="76">
to get money, and make a bargain, better than any man what&s;oever within Temple|Bar.</P>
<P>The&s;e expectations, equally &s;hort-&s;ighted, were al&s;o equally fallacious with the former: the &s;on again returned, and returned, as his father had hoped, a <HI>fini&s;hed &s;tudent;</HI> but, far from being more tractable, or better di&s;|po&s;ed for application to trade, his aver&s;ion to it now was more &s;tubborn, and his oppo|&s;ition more hardy than ever. The young men of fa&s;hion with whom he had formed friend&s;hips at &s;chool, or at the univer&s;ity, and with whom, from the indulgence of his father, he was always able to vie in ex|pence, and from the indulgence of Nature to excel in capacity, earne&s;tly &s;ought the continuance of his acquaintance, and courted and coveted the plea&s;ure of his conver&s;ation: but though he was now totally di&s;qualified for any other &s;ociety, he lo&s;t all delight in their favour from the fear they &s;hould di&s;cover his abode, and &s;edulou&s;ly endeavoured to avoid even occa|&s;ionally meeting them, le&s;t any of his fa|mily &s;hould at the &s;ame time approach him: for of his family, though wealthy, worthy and independent, he was now &s;o utterly a&s;hamed, that the mortification the mo&s;t cruel he could receive, was to be a&s;ked his addre&s;s, or told he &s;hould be vi&s;ited.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77">
Tired, at length, of evading the enqui|ries made by &s;ome, and forcing faint laughs at the detection made by others, he private|ly took a lodging at the We&s;t end of the town, to which he thence forward directed all his friends, and where, under various pretences, he contrived to &s;pend the great|e&s;t part of his time.</P>
<P>In all his expen&s;ive deceits and frolics, his mother was his never-failing confident and a&s;&s;i&s;tant; for when &s;he heard that the companions of her &s;on were men of fa&s;hion, &s;ome born to titles, others de&s;tined to high &s;tations, &s;he concluded he was in the cer|tain road to honour and profit, and fre|quently di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, without ever re|pining, in order to enable him to pre&s;erve upon equal terms, connections which &s;he believed &s;o conducive to his future gran|deur.</P>
<P>In this wild and un&s;ettled manner he pa&s;|&s;ed &s;ome time, &s;truggling ince&s;&s;antly again&s;t the authority of his father, privately abet|ted by his mother, and con&s;tantly aided and admired by his &s;i&s;ters: till, &s;ick of &s;o de|&s;ultory a way of life, he entered him&s;elf a volunteer in the army.</P>
<P>How &s;oon he grew tired of this change has already been related,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 15, 16. Vol. I.</NOTE> as well as his re|conciliation
<PB N="79" REF="78">
with his father, and his becom|ing a &s;tudent at the Temple: for the fa|ther now grew as weary of oppo&s;ing, as the young man of being oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Here, for two or three years, he lived in happine&s;s uninterrupted; he extended his acquaintance among the great, by whom he was no &s;ooner known than care&s;&s;ed and ad|mired, and he frequently vi&s;ited his family, which, though he blu&s;hed to own in public, he affectionately loved in private. His profe&s;&s;ion, indeed, was but little in his thoughts, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive engagements occupy|ing almo&s;t all his hours. Delighted with the favour of the world, and charmed to find his pre&s;ence &s;eemed the &s;ignal for en|tertainment, he &s;oon &s;orgot the uncertainty of his fortune, and the inferiority of his rank; the law grew more and more fatigu|ing, plea&s;ure became more and more allur|ing, and, by degrees, he had not a day un|appropriated to &s;ome party or amu&s;ement; voluntarily con&s;igning the few lei&s;ure mo|ments his gay circle afforded him, to the indulgence of his fancy in &s;ome ha&s;ty com|po&s;itions in ver&s;e, which were handed about in manu&s;cript, and which contributed to keep him in fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Such was his &s;ituation at the death of his father; a new &s;cene was then opened to
<PB N="80" REF="79">
him, and for &s;ome time he he&s;itated what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Old Mr. Belfield, though he lived in great affluence, left not behind him any con&s;iderable fortune, after the portions of his daughters, to each of whom he be|queathed 2000<HI>l.</HI> had been deducted from it. But his &s;tock in trade was great, and his bu&s;ine&s;s was pro&s;perous and lucrative.</P>
<P>His &s;on, however, did not merely want application and fortitude to become his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, but &s;kill and knowledge; his de|liberation, therefore, was ha&s;ty, and his re&s;olution improvident; he determined to continue at the Temple him&s;elf, while the &s;hop, which he could by no means afford to reliqui&s;h, &s;hould be kept up by another name, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of it be tran&s;acted by an agent; hoping thus to &s;ecure and enjoy its emoluments, without either the trouble or the humiliation of attendance.</P>
<P>But this &s;cheme, like mo&s;t others that have their ba&s;is in vanity, ended in nothing but mortification and di&s;appointment: the &s;hop which under old Mr. Belfield had been flouri&s;hing and &s;ucce&s;sful, and enriched him&s;elf and all his family, could now &s;carce &s;upport the expences of an individual. Without a ma&s;ter, without that diligent at|tention to its pro&s;perity which the intere&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="80">
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion alone can give, and the autho|rity of a principal alone can enforce, it quickly lo&s;t its fame for the excellence of its goods, and &s;oon after its cu&s;tomers from the report of its declen&s;ion. The produce, therefore, dimini&s;hed every month; he was &s;urpri&s;ed, he was provoked; he was con|vinced he was cheated, and that his affairs were neglected; but though he threatened from time to time to enquire into the real &s;tate of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of its decay, he felt him&s;elf inade|quate to the ta&s;k; and now fir&s;t lamented that early contempt of trade, which by pre|venting him acquiring &s;ome knowledge of it while he had youth and opportunity, made him now ignorant what redre&s;s to &s;eek, though certain of impo&s;ition and injury.</P>
<P>But yet, however di&s;turbed by alarming &s;ugge&s;tions in his hours of retirement, no alteration was made in the general cour&s;e of his life; he was &s;till the darling of his friends, and the leader in all parties, and &s;till, though his income was le&s;&s;ened, his expences encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such were his circum&s;tances at the time Cecilia fir&s;t &s;aw him at the hou&s;e of Mr. Monckton: from which, two days after her arrival in town, he was him&s;elf &s;ummoned, by an information that his agent had &s;ud|denly left the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="81">
The fatal con&s;equence of this fraudulent elopement was immediate bankrupcy.</P>
<P>His &s;pirits, however, did not yet fail him; as he had never been the nominal ma&s;ter of the &s;hop, he e&s;caped all di&s;honour from its ruin, and was &s;atisfied to con&s;ign what remained to the mercy of the credi|tors, &s;o that his own name &s;hould not ap|pear in the Gazette.</P>
<P>Three of his &s;i&s;ters were already extreme|ly well married to reputable trade&s;men; the two elder of tho&s;e who were yet &s;ingle were &s;ettled with two of tho&s;e who were married, and Henrietta, the younge&s;t, re&s;ided with her mother, who had a comfortable annui|ty, and a &s;mall hou&s;e at Padington.</P>
<P>Bereft thus through vanity and impru|dence of all the long labours of his father, he was now compelled to think &s;eriou&s;ly of &s;ome actual method of maintenance; &s;ince his mother, though willing to &s;acrifice to him even the nouri&s;hment which &s;u&s;tained her, could do for him but little, and that little he had too much ju&s;tice to accept. The law, even to the mo&s;t diligent and &s;uc|ce&s;sful, is extremely &s;low of profit, and whatever, from his connections and abilities might be hoped hereafter, at pre&s;ent requir|ed an expence which he was no longer able to &s;upport.</P>
<P>It remained then to try his influence with
<PB N="83" REF="82">
his friends among the great and the power|ful.</P>
<P>His canva&s;s proved extremely honour|able; every one promi&s;ed &s;omething, and all &s;eemed delighted to have an opportunity of &s;erving him.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with finding the world &s;o much better than report had made it, he now &s;aw the conclu&s;ion of his difficulties in the pro|&s;pect of a place at court.</P>
<P>Belfield, with half the penetration with which he was gifted, would have &s;een in any other man the delu&s;ive idlene&s;s of expecta|tions no better founded; but though di&s;|cernment teaches us the folly of others, ex|perience &s;ingly can teach us our own! he flattered him&s;elf that his friends had been more wi&s;ely &s;elected than the friends of tho&s;e who in &s;imilar circum&s;tances had been be|guiled, and he &s;u&s;pected not the fraud of his vanity, till he found his invitations daily &s;lacken, and that his time was at his own command.</P>
<P>All this hopes now re&s;ted upon one friend and patron, Mr. Floyer, an uncle of Sir Robert Floyer, a man of power in the royal hou&s;ehold, with whom he had lived in great intimacy, and who at this period had the di&s;po&s;al of a place which he &s;oli|cited. The only ob&s;tacle that &s;eemed in his way was from Sir Robert him&s;elf, who
<PB N="84" REF="83">
warmly exerted his intere&s;t in favour of a friend of his own. Mr. Floyer, however, a&s;&s;ured Belfield of the preference, and only begged his patience till he could find &s;ome opportunity of appea&s;ing his nephew.</P>
<P>And this was the &s;tate of his affairs at the time of his quarrel at the Opera-hou&s;e. Al|ready declared opponents of each other, Sir Robert felt double wrath that for <HI>him</HI> Ce|cilia &s;hould reject his civilities; while Bel|field, &s;u&s;pecting he pre&s;umed upon his known dependence on his uncle to affront him, felt al&s;o double indignation at the haughtine&s;s of his behaviour. And thus, &s;light as &s;eemed to the world the cau&s;e of their con|te&s;t, each had private motives of animo&s;ity that &s;erved to &s;timulate revenge.</P>
<P>The very day after this duel, Mr. Floyer wrote him word that he was now obliged in common decency to take the part of his nephew, and therefore had already given the place to the friend he had recom|mended.</P>
<P>This was the termination of his hopes, and the &s;ignal of his ruin! To the pain of his wound he became in&s;en&s;ible, from the &s;uperior pain of this unexpected mi&s;car|riage; yet his pride &s;till enabled him to di&s;gui&s;e his di&s;tre&s;s, and to &s;ee all the friends whom this accident induced to &s;eek him, while from the &s;prightline&s;s he forced
<PB N="85" REF="84">
in order to conceal his angui&s;h, he appear|ed to them more lively and more entertain|ing than ever.</P>
<P>But the&s;e efforts, when left to him&s;elf and to nature, only &s;unk him the deeper in &s;adne&s;s; he found an immediate change in his way of life was nece&s;&s;ary, yet could not brook to make it in &s;ight of tho&s;e with whom he had &s;o long lived in all the brilliancy of equality. A high principle of honour which &s;till, in the mid&s;t of his gay career, had remained uncorrupted, had &s;crupulou&s;ly guarded him from running in debt, and therefore, though of little po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that little was &s;trictly his own. He now pub|li&s;hed that he was going out of town for the benefit of purer air, di&s;charged his &s;urge|on, took a gay leave of his friends, and tru&s;ting no one with his &s;ecret but his &s;er|vant, was privately conveyed to mean and cheap lodgings in Swallow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Here, &s;hut up from every human being he had formerly known, he purpo&s;ed to remain till he grew better, and then again to &s;eek his fortune in the army.</P>
<P>His pre&s;ent &s;ituation, however, was little calculated to contribute to his recovery; the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the &s;urgeon, the precipi|tation of his removal, the inconveniencies of his lodgings, and the un&s;ea&s;onable de|privation of long cu&s;tomary indulgencies,

<PB N="86" REF="85">
were unavoidable delays of his amendment; while the mortification of his pre&s;ent di&s;|grace, and the bitterne&s;s of his late di&s;ap|pointment, preyed ince&s;&s;antly upon his mind, robbed him of re&s;t, heightened his fever, and reduced him by degrees to a &s;tate &s;o low and dangerous, that his &s;er|vant, alarmed for his life, &s;ecretly ac|quainted his mother with his illne&s;s and re|treat.</P>
<P>The mother, almo&s;t di&s;tracted by this intelligence, in&s;tantly, with her daughter, flew to his lodgings. She wi&s;hed to have taken him immediately to her hou&s;e at Pa|dington, but he had &s;uffered &s;o much from his fir&s;t removal, that he would not con|&s;ent to another. She would then have call|ed in a phy&s;ician, but he refu&s;ed even to &s;ee one; and &s;he had too long given way to all his de&s;ires and opinions, to have now the force of mind for exerting the requi&s;ite au|thority of i&s;&s;uing her orders without con|&s;ulting him.</P>
<P>She begged, &s;he pleaded, indeed, and Henrietta joined in her entreaties; but &s;ickne&s;s and vexation had not rendered him tame, though they had made him &s;ullen: he re&s;i&s;ted their prayers, and commonly &s;ilenced them by a&s;&s;urances that their oppo|&s;ition to the plan he had determined to pur|&s;ue,
<PB N="87" REF="86">
only inflamed his fever, and retarded his recovery.</P>
<P>The motive of an obduracy &s;o cruel to his friends was the fear of a detection which he thought not merely prejudicial to his affairs, but di&s;honourable to his character: for, without betraying any &s;ymptom of his di&s;tre&s;s, he had taken a general leave of his acquaintance upon pretence of going out of town, and he could ill endure to make a di&s;covery which would at once proclaim his degradation and his deceit.</P>
<P>Mr. Albany had accidentally broken in upon him, by mi&s;taking his room for that of another &s;ick per&s;on in the &s;ame hou&s;e, to whom his vi&s;it had been intended; but as he knew and reverenced that old gentleman, he did not much repine at his intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was not &s;o ea&s;y when the &s;ame di&s;co|very was made by young Delvile, who, chancing to meet his &s;ervant in the &s;treet, enquired concerning his ma&s;ter's health, and &s;urpri&s;ing from him its real &s;tate, fol|lowed him home; where, &s;oon certain of the change in his affairs by the change of his habitation, he wrote him a letter, in which, after apologizing for his freedom, he warmly declared that nothing could make him &s;o happy as being favoured with his commands, if, either through him&s;elf
<PB N="88" REF="87">
or his friends, he could be &s;o fortunate as to do him any &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Belfield, deeply mortified at this detec|tion of his &s;ituation, returned only a ver|bal an&s;wer of cold thanks, and de&s;ired he would not &s;peak of his being in town, as he was not well enough to be &s;een.</P>
<P>This reply gave almo&s;t equal mortifica|tion to young Delvile, who continued, however, to call at the door with enquiries how he went on, though he made no fur|ther attempt to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Belfield, &s;oftened at length by the kind|ne&s;s of this conduct, determined to admit him; and he was ju&s;t come from paying his fir&s;t vi&s;it, when he was met by Cecilia upon the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>His &s;tay with him had been &s;hort, and he had taken no notice either of his change of abode, or his pretence of going into the country; he had talked to him only in ge|neral terms, and upon general &s;ubjects, till he aro&s;e to depart, and then he re-urged his offers of &s;ervice with &s;o much openne&s;s and warmth, that Belfield, affected by his ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, promi&s;ed he would &s;oon &s;ee him again, and intimated to his delighted mo|ther and &s;i&s;ter, that he would frankly con|&s;ult with him upon his affairs.</P>
<P>Such was the tale which, with various
<PB N="89" REF="88">
minuter circum&s;tances, Mi&s;s Belfield com|municated to Cecilia. <Q REND="inline">"My mother,"</Q> &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"who never quits him, knows that you are here, madam, for &s;he heard me talking with &s;omebody ye&s;terday, and &s;he made me tell her all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and that you &s;aid you would come again this morning."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia returned many acknowledgments for this artle&s;s and unre&s;erved communica|tion, but could not, when it was over, forbear enquiring by what early mi&s;ery &s;he had already, though &s;o very young, &s;pent <HI>two years in nothing but unhappine&s;s?</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"when my poor father died all our family &s;eparated, and I left every body to go and live with my mother at Padington; and I was never a favourite with my mother&mdash;no more, in|deed, was any body but my brother, for &s;he thinks all the re&s;t of the world only made for his &s;ake. So &s;he u&s;ed to deny both her|&s;elf and me almo&s;t common nece&s;&s;aries, in order to &s;ave up money to make him pre|&s;ents: though, if he had known how it was done, he would only have been angry in|&s;tead of taking them. However, I &s;hould have regarded nothing that had but been for his benefit, for I loved him a great deal more than my own convenience; but &s;ums that would di&s;tre&s;s us for months to &s;ave
<PB N="90" REF="89">
up, would by him be &s;pent in a day, and then thought of no more! Nor was that all&mdash;O no! I had much greater unea&s;ine&s;s to &s;uffer; for I was informed by one of my brother's-in-law how ill every thing went, and that certain ruin would come to my poor brother from the treachery of his agent; and the thought of this was always preying upon my mind, for I did not dare tell it my mother, for fear it &s;hould put her out of humour, for, &s;ometimes, &s;he is not very patient; and it mattered little what any of us &s;aid to my brother, for he was too gay and too confident to believe his dan|ger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well but,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I hope, now, all will go better; if your brother will con&s;ent to &s;ee a phy&s;ician&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam! that is the thing I fear he never will do, becau&s;e of being &s;een in the&s;e bad lodgings. I would kneel whole days to prevail with him, but he is unu&s;ed to controul, and knows not how to &s;ubmit to it; and he has lived &s;o long among the great, that he forgets he was not born as high as them&s;elves. Oh that he had never quitted his own family! If he had not been &s;poilt by ambition, he had the be&s;t heart and &s;weete&s;t di&s;po&s;ition in the world. But liv|ing always with his &s;uperiors, taught him to di&s;dain his own relations, and be a&s;hamed
<PB N="91" REF="90">
of us all; and yet now, in the hour of his di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;who el&s;e comes to help him?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then enquired if &s;he wanted not a&s;&s;i&s;tance for her&s;elf and her mother, ob|&s;erving that they did not &s;eem to have all the conveniencies to which they were en|titled.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed, madam,"</Q> &s;he replied, with an ingenuous &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"when you fir&s;t came here I was a little like my brother, for I was &s;adly a&s;hamed to let you &s;ee how ill we lived! but now you know the wor&s;t, &s;o I &s;hall fret about it no more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But this cannot be your u&s;ual way of life; I fear the misfortunes of Mr. Belfield have &s;pread a ruin wider than his own."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No indeed; he took care from the fir&s;t not to involve us in his hazards, for he is very generous, madam, and very noble in all his notions, and could behave to us all no better about money matters than he has ever done. But from the moment we came to this di&s;mal place, and &s;aw his di&s;tre&s;s, and that he was &s;unk &s;o low who u&s;ed al|ways to be higher than any of us, we had a &s;ad &s;cene indeed! My poor mother, who&s;e whole delight was to think that he lived like a nobleman, and who always flattered her|&s;elf that he would ri&s;e to be as great as the company he kept, was &s;o di&s;tracted with her di&s;appointment, that &s;he would not
<PB N="92" REF="91">
li&s;ten to rea&s;on, but immediately di&s;charg|ed both our &s;ervants, &s;aid &s;he and I &s;hould do all the work our&s;elves, hired this poor room for us to live in, and &s;ent to order a bill to be put upon her hou&s;e at Padington, for &s;he &s;aid &s;he would never return to it any more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But are you, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"without any &s;ervant?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We have my brother's man, madam, and &s;o he lights our fires, and takes away &s;ome of our litters; and there is not much el&s;e to be done, except &s;weeping the rooms, for we eat nothing but cold meat from the cook &s;hops."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how long is this to la&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I cannot tell; for the real truth is, my poor mother has almo&s;t lo&s;t her &s;en|&s;es; and ever &s;ince our coming here, &s;he has been &s;o mi&s;erable and &s;o complaining, that indeed, between her and my brother, I have almo&s;t lo&s;t mine too! For when &s;he found all her hopes at an end, and that her darling &s;on, in&s;tead of being rich and pow|erful, and &s;urrounded by friends and ad|mirers, all trying who &s;hould do the mo&s;t for him, was &s;hut up by him&s;elf in this poor little lodging, and in&s;tead of gaining more, had &s;pent all he was worth at fir&s;t, with not a creature to come near him, though ill, though confined, though keep|ing
<PB N="93" REF="92">
his bed!&mdash;Oh madam, had you &s;een my poor mother when &s;he fir&s;t ca&s;t her eyes upon him in that condition!&mdash;indeed you could never have forgotten it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wonder not at her di&s;appointment,"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"with expectations &s;o &s;an|guine, and a &s;on of &s;o much merit, it might well indeed be bitter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, and be&s;ides the di&s;appointment, &s;he is now continually reproaching her&s;elf for always complying with his humours, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to appear better than the re&s;t of his family, though my father never approved her doing &s;o. But &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;o &s;ure of his ri&s;ing, that &s;he believ|ed we &s;hould all thank her for it in the end. And &s;he always u&s;ed to &s;ay that he was born to be a gentleman, and what a grievous thing it would be to have him made a trade&s;man."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, at lea&s;t, &s;he has not the addi|tional mi&s;ery of &s;eeing him ungrateful for her fondne&s;s, however injudicious it may have been?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no! he does nothing but comfort and chear her! and indeed it is very good of him, for he has owned to me in private, that but for her encouragement, he could not have run the cour&s;e he has run, for he &s;hould have been obliged to enter into bu|&s;ine&s;s, whether he had liked it or not. But
<PB N="94" REF="93">
my poor mother knows this, though he will not tell it her, and therefore &s;he &s;ays that unle&s;s he gets well, &s;he will puni&s;h her&s;elf all the re&s;t of her life, and never go back to her hou&s;e, and never hire another &s;er|vant, and never eat any thing but bread, nor drink any thing but water!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor unhappy woman!"</Q> cried Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"how dearly does &s;he pay for her im|prudent and &s;hort-&s;ighted indulgence! but &s;urely you are not al&s;o to &s;uffer in the &s;ame manner?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, not by her fault, for &s;he wants me to go and live with one of my &s;i&s;ters: but I would not quit her for the world; I &s;hould think my&s;elf wicked in|deed to leave her now. Be&s;ides, I don't at all repine at the little hard&s;hips I go through at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e my poor brother is in &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s, that all we &s;ave may be really turned to account; but when we liv|ed &s;o hardly only to procure him luxuries he had no right to, I mu&s;t own I u&s;ed often to think it unfair, and if I had not loved him dearly, I &s;hould not have borne it &s;o well, perhaps, as I ought."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now began to think it high time to relea&s;e her new acquaintance by quitting her, though &s;he felt her&s;elf &s;o much intere&s;t|ed in her affairs, that every word &s;he &s;poke gave her a de&s;ire to lengthen the conver&s;a|tion.
<PB N="95" REF="94">
She ardently wi&s;hed to make her &s;ome pre&s;ent, but was re&s;trained by the fear of offending, or of being again refu&s;ed; &s;he had, however, devi&s;ed a private &s;cheme for &s;erving her more effectually than by the donation of a few guineas, and therefore, after earne&s;tly begging to hear from her if &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly be of any u&s;e, &s;he told her that &s;he &s;hould not find her confidence mi&s;placed, and promi&s;ing again to &s;ee her &s;oon, reluctantly departed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="96" REF="95">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. AN EXPEDIENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;cheme now projected by Cecilia, was to acquaint the &s;urgeon who had already attended Mr. Belfield with his pre|&s;ent &s;ituation and addre&s;s, and to de&s;ire him to continue his vi&s;its, for the payment of which &s;he would her&s;elf be accountable.</P>
<P>The raillery of young Delvile, however, had taught her to fear the con&s;tructions of the world, and &s;he therefore purpo&s;ed to keep both the &s;urgeon and Mr. Belfield ig|norant to whom they were indebted. She was aware, indeed, that whatever might be her management, that high-&s;pirited and un|fortunate young man would be extremely hurt to find him&s;elf thus detected and pur|&s;ued; but &s;he thought his life too well worth pre&s;erving to let it be &s;acrificed to his pride, and her internal conviction of being her&s;elf the immediate cau&s;e of its pre&s;ent danger, gave to her an anxious and re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire to be her&s;elf the means of extricating him from it.</P>
<P>Rupil, the name of the &s;urgeon, &s;he had already heard mentioned by Mr. Arnott,
<PB N="97" REF="96">
and in getting into her chair, &s;he ordered Ralph, her man, to enquire where he lived.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know already where he lives, ma|dam,"</Q> an&s;wered Ralph, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;aw his name over a door in Cavendi&s;h-&s;treet, Ox|ford-road; I took particular notice of it, becau&s;e it was at the hou&s;e where you &s;tood up that day on account of the mob that was waiting to &s;ee the malefactors go to Tyburn."</Q></P>
<P>This an&s;wer unravelled to Cecilia a my|&s;tery which had long perplext her; for the &s;peeches of young Delvile when he had &s;urpri&s;ed her in that &s;ituation were now fully explained. In &s;eeing her come out of the &s;urgeon's hou&s;e, he had naturally con|cluded &s;he had only entered it to a&s;k news of his patient, Mr. Belfield; her prote&s;tations of merely &s;tanding up to avoid the crowd, he had only laughed at; and his hints at her re&s;erve and di&s;&s;imulation, were meant but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">proach her for refu&s;ing his offer of pro|curing her intelligence, at the very time when, to all appearance, &s;he anxiou&s;ly, though clande&s;tinely, &s;ought it for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery, notwith&s;tanding it re|lieved her from all &s;u&s;pence of his meaning, gave her much vexation: to be &s;uppo&s;ed to take an intere&s;t &s;o ardent, yet &s;o private, in the affairs of Mr. Belfield, might well authori&s;e all &s;u&s;picions of her partiality for him: and even if any doubt had yet re|mained,
<PB N="98" REF="97">
the unlucky meeting upon the &s;tairs at his lodgings, would not fail to di&s;pel it, and confirm the notion of her &s;ecret regard. She hoped, however, to have &s;oon &s;ome opportunity of clearing up the mi&s;take, and re&s;olved in the mean time to be &s;tudiou&s;ly cautious in avoiding all appear|ances that might &s;trengthen it.</P>
<P>No caution, however, and no appre|hen&s;ion, could intimidate her active hu|manity from putting into immediate exe|cution a plan in which &s;he feared any delay might be fatal; and therefore the moment &s;he got home, &s;he wrote the following note to the &s;urgeon.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To &mdash; RUPIL, E&s;q. <DATELINE><DATE>March 27, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A FRIEND of Mr. Belfield begs Mr. Ru|pil will immediately call upon that gentle|man, who is in lodgings about the middle of Swallow-&s;treet, and in&s;i&s;t upon vi&s;iting him till he is perfectly recovered. Mr. Rupil is entreated not to make known this reque&s;t, nor to receive from Mr. Belfield any return for his attendance; but to attribute the di&s;covery of his re&s;idence to accident, and to re&s;t a&s;&s;ured he &s;hall be amply recom|pen&s;ed for his time and trouble by the friend who makes this application, and who is willing to give any &s;ecurity that Mr. Rupil
<PB N="99" REF="98">
&s;hall think proper to mention, for the per|formance of this engagement.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Her next difficulty was in what manner to have this note conveyed; to &s;end her own &s;ervant was inevitably betraying her|&s;elf, to employ any other was ri&s;king a confidence that might be &s;till more dan|gerous, and &s;he could not tru&s;t to the penny-po&s;t, as her propo&s;al required an an&s;wer. After much deliberation, &s;he at length determined to have recour&s;e to Mrs. Hill, to who&s;e &s;ervices &s;he was entitled, and upon who&s;e fidelity &s;he could rely.</P>
<P>The morning was already far advanced, but the Harrels dined late, and &s;he would not lo&s;e a day where even an hour might be of importance. She went therefore imme|diately to Mrs. Hill, whom &s;he found al|ready removed into her new habitation in Fetter-lane, and equally bu&s;y and happy in the change of &s;cene and of employment. She gave to her the note, which &s;he de&s;ired her to carry to Cavendi&s;h-&s;treet directly, and either to deliver it into Mr. Rupil's own hands, or to bring it back if he was out; but upon no con&s;ideration to make known whence or from whom it came.</P>
<P>She then went into the back part of the &s;hop, which by Mrs. Roberts was called the parlour, and amu&s;ed her&s;elf during the ab&s;ence of her me&s;&s;enger, by playing with the children.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="99">
Mrs. Hill at her return &s;aid &s;he had found Mr. Rupil at home, and as &s;he re|fu&s;ed to give the letter to the &s;ervant, &s;he had been taken into a room where he was talking with a gentleman, to whom, as &s;oon as he had read it, he &s;aid with a laugh, <Q REND="inline">"Why here's another per&s;on with the &s;ame propo&s;al as yours! however, I &s;hall treat you both alike."</Q> And then he wrote an an&s;wer, which he &s;ealed up, and bid her take care of. This an&s;wer was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>MR. RUPIL will certainly attend Mr. Belfield, who&s;e friends may be &s;atisfied he will do all in his power to recover him, without receiving any recompence but the plea&s;ure of &s;erving a gentleman who is &s;o much beloved.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Cecilia, charmed at this unhoped for &s;ucce&s;s, was making further enquiries into what had pa&s;&s;ed, when Mrs. Hill, in a low voice, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"There's the gentleman, ma|dam, who was with Mr. Rupil when I gave him the letter. I had a notion he was dodg|ing me all the way I came, for I &s;aw him ju&s;t behind me, turn which way I would."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then looked&mdash;and perceived young Delvile! who, after &s;topping a moment at the door, came into the &s;hop, and de&s;ired to be &s;hewn &s;ome gloves, which, among other things, were laid in the window.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="100">
Extremely di&s;concerted at the &s;ight of him, &s;he began now almo&s;t to fancy there was &s;ome fatality attending her acquantance with him, &s;ince &s;he was always &s;ure of meeting, when &s;he had any rea&s;on to wi&s;h avoiding him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he &s;aw he was ob&s;erved by her, he bowed with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect: &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">oured in returning the &s;alutation, and prepared, with no little vexation, for ano|ther attack, and further rallery, &s;imilar to what &s;he had already received from him: but, as &s;oon as he had made his purcha&s;e, he bowed to her again, and, without &s;peak|ing, left the &s;hop.</P>
<P>A &s;ilence &s;o unexpected at once a&s;toni&s;hed and di&s;turbed her; &s;he again de&s;ired to hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> that had pa&s;&s;ed at Mr. Rupil's, and from the relation gathered that Delvile had him|&s;elf undertaken to be re&s;pon&s;ible for his attendance upon Mr. Belfield.</P>
<P>A liberality &s;o like her own failed not to impre&s;s her with the mo&s;t lively e&s;teem: but this &s;erved rather to augment than le&s;&s;en the pain with which &s;he con&s;idered the clande&s;tine appearance &s;he thus repeat|edly made to him. She had no doubt he had immediately concluded &s;he was author of the application to the &s;urgeon, and that he followed her me&s;&s;enger merely to a&s;cer|tain the fact; while his &s;ilence when he had made the di&s;covery, &s;he could only attribute
<PB N="102" REF="101">
to his now believing that her regard for Mr. Belfield was too &s;erious for raillery.</P>
<P>Doubly, however, &s;he rejoiced at the genero&s;ity of Mr. Rupil, as it rendered wholly unnece&s;&s;ary her further interference: for &s;he now &s;aw with &s;ome alarm the danger to which benevolence it&s;elf, directed towards a youthful object, might expo&s;e her.</P>

<P>CECILIA returned home &s;o late, that &s;he was &s;ummoned to the dining parlour the moment &s;he entered the hou&s;e.

<P>Cecilia was thunder&s;truck by this &s;peech, which not only expre&s;ied an open avowal of his preten&s;ions, but a confident &s;ecurity of his &s;ucce&s;s. She was &s;hocked that a man of &s;uch principles &s;hould even for a moment pre&s;ume upon her favour, and irritated at the &s;tubbornne&s;s of Mr. Harrel in not acquainting him with her refu&s;al.</P>
<P>His intimation of coming to the hou&s;e for <HI>the happine&s;s of waiting upon her,</HI> made her determine, without lo&s;ing a moment, to &s;eek her&s;elf an explanation with him: while the di&s;covery that he was included in the Ea&s;ter party, which various other conco|mitant cau&s;es had already rendered di&s;a|greeable to her, made her look forward to that purpo&s;ed expedition with nothing but unwillingne&s;s and di&s;ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But though her earne&s;tne&s;s to conclude this affair made her now put her&s;elf volun|tarily in the way of the baronet, &s;he found
<PB N="105" REF="104">
her plan always counteracted by Mr. Har|rel, who, with an officiou&s;ne&s;s too obvious to pa&s;s for chance, con&s;tantly &s;topt the progre&s;s of any di&s;cour&s;e in which he did not him&s;elf bear a part. A more pa&s;&s;ionate admirer might not have been &s;o ea&s;ily de|feated; but Sir Robert, too proud for &s;oli|citation, and too indolent for a&s;&s;iduity, was very &s;oon checked, becau&s;e very &s;oon wea|ried.</P>
<P>The whole evening, therefore, to her infinite mortification, pa&s;&s;ed away without affording her any opportunity of making known to him his mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Her next effort was to remon&s;trate with Mr. Harrel him&s;elf; but this &s;cheme was not more ea&s;y of execution than the other, &s;ince Mr. Harrel, &s;u&s;pecting &s;he meant again to dun him for her money, avoided all &s;eparate conver&s;ation with her &s;o &s;kilfully, that &s;he could not find a moment to make him hear her.</P>
<P>She then re&s;olved to apply to his lady; but here her &s;ucce&s;s was not better: Mrs. Harrel, dreading another lecture upon oeco|nomy, peevi&s;hly an&s;wered to her reque&s;t of a conference, that &s;he was not very well, and could not talk gravely.</P>
<P>Cecilia, ju&s;tly offended with them all, had now no re&s;ource but in Mr. Monckton,
<PB N="106" REF="105">
who&s;e coun&s;el for effectually di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the baronet, &s;he determined to &s;olicit by the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>The moment, therefore, that &s;he next &s;aw him, &s;he acquainted him with the &s;peeches of Sir Robert and the behaviour of Mr. Harrel.</P>
<P>There needed no rhetoric to point out to Mr. Monckton the danger of &s;uffering &s;uch expectations, or the impropriety of her pre|&s;ent &s;ituation: he was &s;truck with both in a manner the mo&s;t forcible, and &s;pared not for warmth of expre&s;&s;ion to alarm her deli|cacy, or add to her di&s;plea&s;ure. But chiefly he was exa&s;perated again&s;t Mr. Harrel, a&s;&s;uring her there could be no doubt but that he had &s;ome particular intere&s;t in &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly and artfully &s;upporting the pre|ten&s;ions of Sir Robert. Cecilia endeavoured to refute this opinion, which &s;he regarded as proceeding rather from prejudice than ju&s;tice; but when &s;he mentioned that the baronet was invited to &s;pend the Ea&s;ter holidays at Violet Bank, he repre&s;ented with &s;uch energy the con&s;equent con|&s;tructions of the world, as well as the unavoidable encouragement &s;uch intimacy would imply, that he terrified her into an earne&s;t entreaty to &s;ugge&s;t to her &s;ome way of deliverance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is only one;"</Q> an&s;wered he,
<PB N="107" REF="106">
<Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t peremptorily refu&s;e to go to Violet Bank your&s;elf. If, after what has pa&s;&s;ed, you are included in the &s;ame party with Sir Robert, you give a &s;anction your|&s;elf to the reports already circulated of your engagements with him: and the effect of &s;uch a &s;anction will be more &s;erious than you can ea&s;ily imagine, &s;ince the knowledge that a connection is believed in the world, frequently, if not generally, leads by im|perceptible degrees to its real ratification."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, with the utmo&s;t alacrity, pro|mi&s;ed implicitly to follow his advice, what|ever might be the oppo&s;ition of Mr. Harrel. He quitted her, therefore, with unu&s;ual &s;atisfaction, happy in his power over her mind, and anticipating with &s;ecret rapture the felicity he had in re&s;erve from vi&s;iting her during the ab&s;ence of the family.</P>
<P>As no private interview was nece&s;&s;ary for making known her intention of giving up the Ea&s;ter party, which was to take place in two day's time, &s;he mentioned the next morning her de&s;ign of &s;pending the holidays in town, when Mr. Harrel &s;auntered into the breakfa&s;t room to give &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion to his lady.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he only laughed at her plan, gaily rallying her upon her love of &s;olitude; but when he found it was &s;erious, he very warmly oppo&s;ed it, and called upon Mrs.
<PB N="108" REF="107">
Harrel to join in his expo&s;tulations. That lady complied, but in &s;o faint a manner, that Cecilia &s;oon &s;aw &s;he did not wi&s;h to prevail; and with a concern that co&s;t her infinite pain, now finally perceived that not only all her former affection was &s;ub&s;ided into indifference, but that, &s;ince &s;he had endeavoured to abridge her amu&s;ements, &s;he regarded her as a &s;py, and dreaded her as the cen&s;or of her conduct.</P>
<P>Mean while Mr. Arnott, who was pre&s;ent, though he interfered not in the debate, waited the event with anxiety; naturally hoping her objections aro&s;e from her di&s;like of Sir Robert, and &s;ecretly re&s;olving to be guided him&s;elf by her motions.</P>
<P>Cecilia at length, tired of the importu|nities of Mr. Harrel, gravely &s;aid, that if he de&s;ired to hear the rea&s;ons which obliged her to refu&s;e his reque&s;t, &s;he was ready to communicate them.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, after a little he&s;itation, ac|companied her into another room.</P>
<P>She then declared her re&s;olution not to live under the &s;ame roof with Sir Robert, and very openly expre&s;&s;ed her vexation and di&s;plea&s;ure, that he &s;o evidently per&s;i&s;ted in giving that gentleman encouragement.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> an&s;wered he, carele&s;sly, <Q REND="inline">"when young ladies will not know their own minds, it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome
<PB N="109" REF="108">
friend &s;hould tell it them: you were cer|tainly very favourable to Sir Robert but a &s;hort time ago, and &s;o, I dare &s;ay, you will be again, when you have &s;een more of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You amaze me, Sir!"</Q> cried Cecilia: <Q REND="inline">"when was I favourable to him? Has he not always and regularly been my aver|&s;ion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fancy,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Harrel, laugh|ing, <Q REND="inline">"you will not ea&s;ily per&s;uade him to think &s;o; your behaviour at the Opera|hou&s;e was ill calculated to give him that notion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My behaviour at the Opera-hou&s;e, Sir, I have already explained to you; and if Sir Robert him&s;elf has any doubts, either from that circum&s;tance or from any other, pardon me if I &s;ay they can only be attri|buted to your unwillingne&s;s to remove them. I entreat you, therefore, to trifle with him no longer, nor to &s;ubject me again to the freedom of implications extremely di&s;agreeable to me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O fie, fie, Mi&s;s Beverley! after all that has pa&s;&s;ed, after his long expectations, and his con&s;tant attendance, you cannot for a moment think &s;eriou&s;ly of di&s;carding him."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, equally &s;urpri&s;ed and provoked by this &s;peech, could not for a moment tell
<PB N="110" REF="109">
how to an&s;wer it; and Mr. Harrel, wilfully mi&s;interpreting her &s;ilence, took her hand, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Come, I am &s;ure you have too much honour to make a fool of &s;uch a man as Sir Robert Floyer. There is not a wo|man in town who will not envy your choice, and I a&s;&s;ure you there is not a man in Eng|land I would &s;o &s;oon recommend to you."</Q></P>
<P>He would then have hurried her back to the next room; but, drawing away her hand with undi&s;gui&s;ed re&s;entment, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"this mu&s;t not pa&s;s! my po&s;itive rejection of Sir Robert the in&s;tant you communicated to me his propo&s;als, you can neither have forgotten nor mi&s;taken: and you mu&s;t not wonder if I acknowledge my&s;elf extremely di&s;obliged by your un|accountable per&s;everance in refu&s;ing to re|ceive my an&s;wer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Young ladies who have been brought up in the country,"</Q> returned Mr. Harrel, with his u&s;ual negligence, <Q REND="inline">"are always &s;o high flown in their notions, it is difficult to deal with them; but as I am much better acquainted with the world than you can be, you mu&s;t give me leave to tell you, that if, after all, you refu&s;e Sir Robert, it will be u&s;ing him very ill."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why will you &s;ay &s;o, Sir?"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"when it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible you can have formed &s;o prepo&s;terous an opi|nion.
<PB N="111" REF="110">
Pray hear me, however, finally, and pray tell Sir Robert&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> interrupted he, with affected gaiety, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;hall manage it all your own way; I will have nothing to do with the quarrels of lovers."</Q></P>
<P>And then, with a pretended laugh, he ha&s;tily left her.</P>
<P>Cecilia was &s;o much incen&s;ed by this im|practicable behaviour, that in&s;tead of re|turning to the family, &s;he went directly to her own room. It was ea&s;y for her to &s;ee that Mr. Harrel was bent upon u&s;ing every method he could devi&s;e, to entangle her into &s;ome engagement with Sir Robert, and though &s;he could not imagine the meaning of &s;uch a &s;cheme, the littlene&s;s of his beha|viour excited her contempt, and the long|continued error of the baronet gave her the utmo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. She again determined to &s;eek an explanation with him her&s;elf, and immovably to refu&s;e joining the party to Violet Bank.</P>
<P>The following day, while the ladies and Mr. Arnott were at breakfa&s;t, Mr. Harrel came into the room to enquire if they &s;hould all be ready to &s;et off for his villa by ten o'clock the next day. Mrs. Harrel and her brother an&s;wered in the affirmative; but Cecilia was &s;ilent, and he turned to her and repeated his que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="111">
<Q REND="inline">"Do you think me &s;o capricious, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that after telling you but ye&s;ter|day I could not be of your party, I &s;hall tell you to-day that I can?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you do not really mean to re|main in town by your&s;elf?"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline">"you cannot &s;uppo&s;e that will be an eli|gible plan for a young lady. On the con|trary, it will be &s;o very improper, that I think my&s;elf, as your Guardian, obliged to oppo&s;e it."</Q></P>
<P>Amazed at this authoritative &s;peech, Cecilia looked at him with a mixture of mortification and anger; but knowing it would be vain to re&s;i&s;t his power if he was re&s;olute to exert it, &s;he made not any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be&s;ides,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"I have a plan for &s;ome alterations in the hou&s;e dur|ing my ab&s;ence; and I think your room, in particular, will be much improved by them: but it will be impo&s;&s;ible to employ any workmen, if we do not all quit the premi&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>This determined per&s;ecution now &s;eri|ou&s;ly alarmed her; &s;he &s;aw that Mr. Harrel would omit no expedient or &s;tratagem to encourage the addre&s;&s;es of Sir Robert, and force her into his pre&s;ence; and &s;he began next to apprehend that her connivance in his conduct might be pre&s;umed upon by
<PB N="113" REF="112">
that gentleman: &s;he re&s;olved, therefore, as the la&s;t and only effort in her power for avoiding him, to endeavour to find an ac|commodation at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Delvile, during the excur&s;ion to Violet Bank: and if, when &s;he returned to Portman-&s;quare, the baronet &s;till per&s;evered in his attendance, to entreat her friend Mr. Monckton would take upon him&s;elf the charge of undeceiving him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A VICTORY.</HEAD>
<P>AS not a moment was now to be lo&s;t, Cecilia had no &s;ooner &s;ugge&s;ted this &s;cheme, than &s;he ha&s;tened to St. James's Square, to try its practicability.</P>
<P>She found Mrs. Delvile alone, and &s;till at breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t compliments were over, while &s;he was con&s;idering in what manner to introduce her propo&s;al, Mrs. Delvile her|&s;elf led to the &s;ubject, by &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry to hear we are &s;o &s;oon to lo&s;e you; but I hope Mr. Harrel does not intend to make any long &s;tay at his villa; for if he does, I &s;hall be half tempted to come and run away with you from him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And that,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, delighted with this opening, <Q REND="inline">"would be an honour I am <HI>more</HI> than half tempted to de&s;ire."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed your leaving London at this time,"</Q> continued Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is, for me, particularly unfortunate, as, if I could now be favoured with your vi&s;its, I &s;hould doubly value them; for Mr. Del|vile is gone to &s;pend the holydays at the
<PB N="115" REF="114">
Duke of Derwent's, whither I was not well enough to accompany him; my &s;on has his own engagements, and there are &s;o few people I can bear to &s;ee, that I &s;hall live al|mo&s;t entirely alone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"in &s;uch a &s;itu|ation might hope to be admitted, how glad|ly for that happine&s;s would I exchange my expedition to Violet-bank!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good, and very ami|able,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"and your &s;o|ciety would, indeed, give me infinite &s;atis|faction. Yet I am no enemy to &s;olitude; on the contrary, company is commonly burthen&s;ome to me; I find few who have any power to give me entertainment, and even of tho&s;e few, the chief part have in their manners, &s;ituation, or characters, an unfortunate <HI>&s;omething,</HI> that generally renders a near connection with them inconvenient or di&s;agreeable. There are, indeed, &s;o many draw-backs to regard and intimacy, from pride, from propriety, and various other collateral cau&s;es, that rarely as we meet with people of brilliant parts, there is almo&s;t ever &s;ome objection to our de&s;ire of meeting them again. Yet to live wholly alone is chear|le&s;s and depre&s;&s;ing; and with you, at lea&s;t,"</Q> taking Cecilia's hand, <Q REND="inline">"I find not one &s;ingle ob&s;tacle to oppo&s;e to a thou&s;and in|ducements, which invite me to form a
<PB N="116" REF="115">
friend&s;hip that I can only hope may be as la&s;ting, as I am &s;ure it will be plea&s;ant."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia expre&s;&s;ed her &s;en&s;e of this partia|lity in the warme&s;t terms; and Mrs. Del|vile, &s;oon di&s;covering by her manner that &s;he took not any del ght in her intended vi&s;it to Violet-Bank, began next to que&s;ti|on her whether it would be po&s;&s;ible for her to give it up.</P>
<P>She in&s;tantly an&s;wered in the affirmative.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And would you really be &s;o obliging,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"as to be&s;tow upon me the time you had de&s;tin|ed for this gay excur&s;ion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t willingly,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if you are &s;o good as to wi&s;h it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But can you al&s;o&mdash;for you mu&s;t by no means remain alone in Portman Square,&mdash;manage to live entirely in my hou&s;e till Mr. Harrel's return?"</Q></P>
<P>To this propo&s;al, which was what &s;he mo&s;t de&s;ired, Cecilia gave a glad a&s;&s;ent; and Mrs. Delvile, extremely plea&s;ed with her compliance, promi&s;ed to have an apart|ment prepared for her immediately.</P>
<P>She then ha&s;tened home, to announce her new plan.</P>
<P>This &s;he took occa&s;ion to do when the fa|mily was a&s;&s;embled at dinner. The &s;ur|prize with which &s;he was heard was very general: Sir Robert &s;eemed at a lo&s;s what
<PB N="117" REF="116">
conclu&s;ion to draw from her information; Mr. Arnott was half elated with plea&s;ure, and half depre&s;&s;ed with apprehen&s;ion; Mrs. Harrel wondered, without any other &s;en&s;a|tion; and Mr. Harrel him&s;elf was evident|ly the mo&s;t concerned of the party.</P>
<P>Every effort of per&s;ua&s;ion and importu|nity he now e&s;&s;ayed to prevail upon her to give up this &s;cheme, and &s;till accompany them to the villa; but &s;he coolly an&s;wered that her engagement with Mrs. Delvile was decided, and &s;he had appointed to wait upon her the next morning.</P>
<P>When her re&s;olution was found &s;o &s;teady, a general ill humour took place of &s;urpri&s;e: Sir Robert now had the air of a man who thought him&s;elf affronted; Mr. Arnott was wretched from a thou&s;and uncertainties; Mrs. Harrel, indeed, was &s;till the mo&s;t in|different; but Mr. Harrel could hardly re|pre&s;s his di&s;appointment and anger.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however, was all gaiety and plea|&s;ure: in removing only from the hou&s;e of one guardian to another, &s;he knew &s;he could not be oppo&s;ed; and the flattering readine&s;s with which Mrs. Delvile had anticipated her reque&s;t, without enquiring into her mo|tives, had relieved her from a &s;ituation which now grew extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, with|out giving to her the pain of making com|plaints of Mr. Harrel. The ab&s;ence of Mr.
<PB N="118" REF="117">
Delvile contributed to her happine&s;s, and &s;he much rejoiced in having now the pro|&s;pect of a &s;peedy opportunity to explain to his &s;on, whatever had appeared my&s;terious in her conduct re&s;pecting Mr. Belfield. If &s;he had any thing to regret, it was merely the impo&s;&s;ibility, at this time, of waiting for the coun&s;el of Mr. Monckton.</P>
<P>The next morning, while the family was in the mid&s;t of preparation for departure, &s;he took leave of Mrs. Harrel, who faintly lamented the lo&s;s of her company, and then ha&s;tily made her compliments to Mr. Har|rel and Mr. Arnott, and putting her&s;elf in|to a chair, was conveyed to her new habi|tation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile received her with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed politene&s;s; &s;he conducted her to the apartment which had been prepared for her, led her to the library, which &s;he de&s;ired her to make u&s;e of as her own, and gave her the mo&s;t obliging charges to re|member that &s;he was in a hou&s;e of which &s;he had the command.</P>
<P>Young Delvile did not make his appear|ance till dinner time. Cecilia, from recol|lecting the &s;trange &s;ituations in which &s;he had lately been &s;een by him, blu&s;hed ex|tremely when &s;he fir&s;t met his eyes; but finding him gay and ea&s;y, general in his conver&s;ation, and unde&s;igning in his looks,
<PB N="119" REF="118">
&s;he &s;oon recovered from her embarra&s;&s;ment, and pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day without re|&s;traint or unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Every hour &s;he &s;pent with Mrs. Delvile, contributed to rai&s;e in her e&s;teem the mind and under&s;tanding of that lady. She found, indeed, that it was not for nothing &s;he was accu&s;ed of pride, but &s;he found at the &s;ame time &s;o many excellent qualities, &s;o much true dignity of mind, and &s;o noble a &s;pirit of liberality, that however great was the re|&s;pect &s;he &s;eemed to demand, it was always inferior to what &s;he felt inclined to pay.</P>
<P>Nor was young Delvile le&s;s rapid in the progre&s;s he made in her favour; his cha|racter, upon every opportunity of &s;hewing it, ro&s;e in her opinion, and his di&s;po&s;ition and manners had a mingled &s;weetne&s;s and vivacity that rendered his &s;ociety attractive, and his conver&s;ation &s;pirited.</P>
<P>Here, therefore, Cecilia experienced that happine&s;s &s;he &s;o long had coveted in vain: her life was neither public nor private, her amu&s;ements were neither di&s;&s;ipated nor re|tired; the company &s;he &s;aw were either people of high rank or &s;trong parts, and their vi&s;its were neither frequent nor long. The &s;ituation &s;he quitted gave a ze&s;t to that into which &s;he entered, for &s;he was now no longer &s;hocked by extravagance or levity, no longer tormented with addre&s;&s;es which
<PB N="120" REF="119">
di&s;gu&s;ted her, nor mortified by the ingrati|tude of the friend &s;he had endeavoured to &s;erve. All was &s;mooth and &s;erene, yet live|ly and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Her plan, however, of clearing to young Delvile his mi&s;takes concerning Belfield, &s;he could not put in execution; for he now never led to the &s;ubject, though he was fre|quently alone with her, nor &s;eemed at all de&s;irous to renew his former raillery, or re|peat his enquiries. She wondered at this change in him, but cho&s;e rather to wait the revival of his own curio&s;ity, than to di&s;tre&s;s or perplex her&s;elf by contriving methods of explanation.</P>
<P>Situated thus happily, &s;he had now one only anxiety, which was to know whether, and in what manner, Mr. Belfield had re|ceived his &s;urgeon, as well as the actual &s;tate of his own and his &s;i&s;ter's affairs: but the fear of again encountering young Delvile in &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, deterred her at pre&s;ent from going to their hou&s;e. Yet her natural benevolence, which partial conve|nience never lulled to &s;leep, impre&s;&s;ing her with an apprehen&s;ion that her &s;ervices might be wanted, &s;he was induced to write to Mi&s;s Belfield, though &s;he forbore to vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>Her letter was &s;hort, but kind and to the purpo&s;e: &s;he apologized for her officiou&s;|ne&s;s, de&s;ired to know if her brother was
<PB N="121" REF="120">
better, and entreated her, in terms the mo&s;t delicate, to acquaint her if yet &s;he would accept from her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>She &s;ent this letter by her &s;ervant, who, after waiting a con&s;iderable time, brought her the following an&s;wer.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<P>Ah madam! your goodne&s;s quite melts me! we want nothing, however, yet, though I fear we &s;hall not &s;ay &s;o much longer. But though I hope I &s;hall never forget my&s;elf &s;o as to be proud and impertinent, I will ra|ther &s;truggle with any hard&s;hip than beg, for I will not di&s;oblige my poor brother by any fault that I can help, e&s;pecially now he is fallen &s;o low. But, thank heaven, his wound has at la&s;t been dre&s;&s;ed, for the &s;urge|on has found him out, and he attends him for nothing; though my brother is willing to part with every thing he is worth in the world, rather than owe that obligation to him: yet I often wonder why he hates &s;o to be obliged, for when he was rich him|&s;elf he was always doing &s;omething to oblige other people. But I fear the &s;urgeon thinks him very bad! for he won't &s;peak to us when we follow him down &s;tairs.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Cecilia, much moved by the &s;implicity of this letter, determined that her very fir&s;t vi&s;it from Portman-Square &s;hould be to its fair and innocent writer. And having now an a&s;&s;urance that &s;he was in no immediate di&s;tre&s;s, and that her brother was actually under Mr. Rupil's care, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from her mind the only &s;ubject of unea&s;ine&s;s that
<PB N="123" REF="122">
at pre&s;ent had endeavoured to di&s;turb it, and gave her&s;elf wholly up to the delightful &s;erenity of unallayed happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Few are the days of felicity unmixed which we acknowledge while we experi|ence, though many are tho&s;e we deplore, when by &s;orrow taught their value, and by misfortune, their lo&s;s. Time with Cecilia now glided on with &s;uch rapidity, that before &s;he thought the morning half over, the evening was clo&s;ed, and ere &s;he was &s;en&s;ible the fir&s;t week was pa&s;t, the &s;econd was de|parted for ever. More and more plea&s;ed with the inmates of her new habitation, &s;he found in the abilities of Mrs. Delvile &s;ources inexhau&s;tible of entertainment, and in the di&s;po&s;ition and &s;entiments of her &s;on &s;omething &s;o concordant to her own, that almo&s;t every word he &s;poke &s;hewed the &s;ym|pathy of their minds, and almo&s;t every look which caught her eyes was a reciprocation of intelligence. Her heart, deeply wound|ed of late by unexpected indifference, and unde&s;erved mortification, was now, per|haps, more than u&s;ually &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e penetrating and exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures which friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s the highe&s;t powers of be&s;towing. Ea&s;y, gay, and airy, &s;he only ro&s;e to happine&s;s, and only retired to re&s;t; and not merely heightened was her pre&s;ent enjoyment by her pa&s;t di&s;appoint|ment,
<PB N="124" REF="123">
but, carrying her retro&s;pection to her earlie&s;t remembrance, &s;he &s;till found her actual &s;ituation more peculiarly adapted to her ta&s;te and temper, than any &s;he had hi|therto at any time experienced.</P>
<P>The very morning that the de&s;tined fort|night was elap&s;ed, &s;he received a note from Mrs. Harrel, with information of her arri|val in town, and an entreaty that &s;he would return to Portman-Square.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who, thus happy, had forgot to mark the progre&s;s of time, was now all amazement to find the term of her ab&s;ence &s;o &s;oon pa&s;t. She thought of going back with the utmo&s;t reluctance, and of quitting her new abode with the mo&s;t lively regret. The repre&s;entations of Mr. Monckton daily lo&s;t their force, and notwith&s;tanding her di&s;like of Mr. Delvile, &s;he had no wi&s;h &s;o earne&s;t as that of being &s;ettled in his fa|mily for the re&s;t of her minority.</P>
<P>To effect this was her next thought; yet &s;he knew not how to make the propo&s;al, but from the uncommon partiality of Mrs. Delvile, &s;he hoped, with a very little en|couragement, &s;he would lead to it her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here, however, &s;he was di&s;appointed; Mrs. Delvile, when &s;he heard of the &s;um|mons from the Harrels, expre&s;&s;ed her &s;or|row at lo&s;ing her in terms of the mo&s;t flat|tering
<PB N="125" REF="124">
regret, yet &s;eemed to think the part|ing indi&s;pen&s;able, and dropt not the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of attempting to prevent it.</P>
<P>Cecilia, vexed and di&s;concerted, then made arrangements for her departure, which &s;he fixed for the next morning.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this day, unlike every other which for the la&s;t fortnight had preceded it, was pa&s;&s;ed with little appearance, and no reality of &s;atisfaction: Mrs. Delvile was evidently concerned, her &s;on openly avow|ed his chagrin, and Cecilia felt the utmo&s;t mortification; yet, though every one was di&s;contented, no effort was made towards obtaining any delay.</P>
<P>The next morning during breakfa&s;t, Mrs. Delvile very elegantly thanked her for granting to her &s;o much of her time, and earne&s;tly begged to &s;ee her in future when|ever &s;he could be &s;pared from her other friends; prote&s;ting &s;he was now &s;o accu&s;|tomed to her &s;ociety, that &s;he &s;hould require both long and frequent vi&s;its to &s;often the &s;eparation. This reque&s;t was very eagerly &s;econded by young Delvile, who warmly &s;poke his &s;atisfaction that his mother had found &s;o charming a friend, and unaffect|edly joined in her entreaties that the inti|macy might be &s;till more clo&s;ely cemented.</P>
<P>Cecilia had no great difficulty in accord|ing her compliance to tho&s;e demands, of
<PB N="126" REF="125">
which the kindne&s;s and cordiality &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened her di&s;turbance at the parting.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Harrel's carriage arrived, Mrs. Delvile took a mo&s;t affectionate leave of her, and her &s;on attended her to the coach.</P>
<P>In her way down &s;tairs, he &s;topt her for a few moments, and in &s;ome confu&s;ion &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h much to apologize to Mi&s;s Bever|ley, before her departure, for the very gro&s;s mi&s;take of which I have been guilty. I know not if it is po&s;&s;ible &s;he can pardon me, and I hardly know my&s;elf by what perver|&s;ity and blindne&s;s I per&s;i&s;ted &s;o long in my error."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried Cecilia, much rejoiced at this voluntary explanation, <Q REND="inline">"if you are but convinced you were really in an error, I have nothing more to wi&s;h. Appearances, indeed, were &s;o &s;trangely again&s;t me, that I ought not, perhaps, to wonder they de|ceived you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is being candid indeed,"</Q> an&s;wer|ed he, again leading her on: <Q REND="inline">"and in truth, though your anxiety was obvious, its cau&s;e was ob&s;cure, and where any thing is left to conjecture, opinion interferes, and the judgment is ea&s;ily warped. My own partiality, however, for Mr. Belfield, will I hope plead my excu&s;e, as from that, and not from any prejudice again&s;t the Baronet,
<PB N="127" REF="126">
my mi&s;take aro&s;e: on the contrary, &s;o high|ly I re&s;pect your ta&s;te and your di&s;cernment, that your approbation, when known, can &s;carcely fail of &s;ecuring mine."</Q></P>
<P>Great as was the a&s;toni&s;hment of Cecilia at the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech; &s;he was at the coach door before &s;he could make any an&s;wer: but Delvile, perceiving her &s;ur|pri&s;e, added, while he handed her in, <Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible&mdash;but no, it is <HI>not</HI> po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be again mi&s;taken. I forbore to &s;peak at all, till I had information by which I could not be mi&s;led."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not in what unaccountable ob|&s;curity,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I, or my affairs, may be involved, but I perceive that the cloud which I had hoped was di&s;&s;ipated, is thicker and more impenetrable than ever."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile then bowed to her with a look that accu&s;ed her of in&s;incerity, and the car|riage drove away.</P>
<P>Teazed by the&s;e eternal mi&s;takes, and provoked to find that though the object of her &s;uppo&s;ed partiality was &s;o frequently changed, the notion of her po&s;itive engage|ment with one of the dueli&s;ts was invariable, &s;he re&s;olved with all the &s;peed in her power, to commi&s;&s;ion Mr. Monckton to wait upon Sir Robert Floyer, and in her own name give a formal rejection to his propo&s;als, and de&s;ire him thenceforward to make known,
<PB N="128" REF="127">
by every opportunity, their total indepen|dance of each other: for &s;ick of debating with Mr. Harrel, and dete&s;ting all inter|cour&s;e with Sir Robert, &s;he now dropt her de&s;ign of &s;eeking an explanation her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She was received by Mrs. Harrel with the &s;ame coldne&s;s with which &s;he had part|ed from her. That lady appeared now to have &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s upon her mind, and Cecilia endeavoured to draw from her its cau&s;e; but far from &s;eeking any al|leviation in friend&s;hip, &s;he &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided her, &s;eeming pained by her con|ver&s;ation, and reproached by her &s;ight. Cecilia perceived this encrea&s;ing re&s;erve with much concern, but with more indig|nation, con&s;cious that her good offices had merited a better reception, and angry to find that her advice had not merely failed of &s;ucce&s;s, but even expo&s;ed her to aver|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, on the contrary, behaved to her with unu&s;ual civility, &s;eemed eager to oblige her, and de&s;irous to render his hou&s;e more agreeable to her than ever. But in this he did not pro&s;per; for Ceci|lia, immediately upon her return, looking in her apartment for the projected altera|tions, and finding none had been made, was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted by &s;uch a detection of duplici|ty, that he &s;unk yet lower than before in
<PB N="129" REF="128">
her opinion, and &s;he repined at the nece&s;|&s;ity &s;he was under of any longer continuing his gue&s;t.</P>
<P>The joy of Mr. Arnott at again &s;eeing her, was vi&s;ible and &s;incere; and not a little was it encrea&s;ed by finding that Cecilia, who &s;ought not more to avoid Mr. Harrel and Sir Robert, than &s;he was her&s;elf avoid|ed by Mrs. Harrel, talked with plea&s;ure to nobody el&s;e in the hou&s;e, and &s;carce|ly attempted to conceal that he was the only one of the family who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any portion of her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Even Sir Robert appeared now to have formed a de&s;ign of paying her rather more re&s;pect than he had hitherto thought nece&s;|&s;ary; but the violence he did him&s;elf was &s;o evident, and his imperious nature &s;eem|ed &s;o repugnant to the ta&s;k, that his in&s;o|lence, breaking forth by &s;tarts, and check|ed only by compul&s;ion, was but the more con&s;picuous from his inadequate efforts to di&s;gui&s;e it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A COMPLAINT.</HEAD>
<P>AS Cecilia now found her&s;elfe cleared, at lea&s;t, of all &s;u&s;picions of harbouring too tender a regard for Mr. Belfield, her objections to vi&s;iting his &s;i&s;ter were removed, and the morning after her return to Mr. Harrel's, &s;he went in a chair to Swallow|&s;treet.</P>
<P>She &s;ent her &s;ervant up &s;tairs to enquire if &s;he might be admitted, and was imme|diately taken into the room where &s;he had twice before been received.</P>
<P>In a few minutes Mi&s;s Belfield, &s;oftly opening and &s;hutting the door of the next apartment, made her appearance. She looked thin and pale, but much gratified by the &s;ight of Cecilia. <Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"you are good indeed not to forget us! and you can little think how it chears and con&s;oles me, that &s;uch a lady as you can conde&s;cend to be kind to me.
<PB N="131" REF="130">
It is quite the only plea&s;ure that I have now in the whole world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I grieve that you have no greater;"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;eem much fatigued and harra&s;&s;ed. How is your brother? I fear you neglect your own health, by too much attention to his."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, madam; my mother does every thing for him her&s;elf, and hardly &s;uffers any body el&s;e to go near him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then, makes you &s;o melan|choly?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, taking her hand; <Q REND="inline">"you do not look well; your anxiety, I am &s;ure, is too much for your &s;trength."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How &s;hould I look well, madam,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"living as I live? however, I will not talk of my&s;elf, but of my bro|ther,&mdash;O he is &s;o ill! indeed I am &s;adly, &s;adly afraid he will never be well again!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What does his &s;urgeon &s;ay? you are too tender, and too much frightened to be any judge."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not that I think my&s;elf he will die of his wound, for Mr. Rupil &s;ays the wound is almo&s;t nothing; but he is in a con&s;tant fever, and &s;o thin, and &s;o weak, that indeed it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould recover!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are too apprehen&s;ive,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"you know not what effect the coun|try air may have upon him; there are many,
<PB N="132" REF="131">
many expedients that with &s;o young a man may yet be &s;ucce&s;sful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, the country air can do nothing for him! for I will not deceive you, ma|dam, for that would be doubly a fault when I am &s;o ready in blaming other people for wearing fal&s;e appearances: be&s;ides, you are &s;o good and &s;o gentle, that it quite com|po&s;es me to talk with you. So I will ho|ne&s;tly &s;peak the truth, and the whole truth at once; my poor brother is lo&s;t&mdash;O I fear for ever lo&s;t!&mdash;all by his own unhappy pride! he forgets his father was a trade&s;|man, he is a&s;named of all his family, and his whole de&s;ire is to live among the grande&s;t people, as if he belonged to no other. And now that he can no longer do that, he takes the di&s;appointment &s;o to heart that he can|not get the better of it; and he told me this morning that he wi&s;hed he was dead, for he did not know why he &s;hould live only to &s;ee his own ruin! But when he &s;aw how I cried at his &s;aying &s;o, he was very &s;orry in|deed, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> he has always been the kinde&s;t brother in the world, when he has been away from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">reat folks who have &s;poilt him; but why, &s;aid he, Henrietta, why would you have me live, when in&s;tead of rai&s;ing you and my poor mother into an higher &s;tation, I am &s;unk &s;o low, that I only help to con&s;ume your own poor pit|tances to &s;upport me in my di&s;grace!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="132">
<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to find he has &s;o deep a &s;en&s;e of the failure of his expectations: but how happens it that <HI>you</HI> are &s;o much wi&s;er? Young and inex|perienced as you are, and early as you mu&s;t have been accu&s;tomed, from your mother as well as from Mr. Belfield, to far other doctrine, the clearne&s;s of your judgment, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of your remarks, a&s;toni&s;h as much as they charm me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam! brought up as I have been brought up, there is little wonder I &s;hould &s;ee the danger of an high education, let me be ever &s;o ignorant of every thing el&s;e; for I, and all my &s;i&s;ters, have been the &s;ufferers the whole time: and while we were kept backward, that he might be brought forward, while we were denied comforts, that he might have luxuries, how could we help &s;eeing the evil of &s;o much vanity, and wi&s;hing we had all been brought up according to our proper &s;tation? in&s;tead of living in continual inconvenience, and having one part of a family &s;truggling with di&s;tre&s;s, only to let another part of it ap|pear in a way he had no right to!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How rationally,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"have you con&s;idered this &s;ubject! and how much do I honour you for the affection you re|tain for your brother, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="134" REF="133">
wrongs you have &s;uffered to promote his elevation!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed he de&s;erves it; take but from him that one fault, pride, and I believe he has not another: and humoured and darling child as from his infancy he has always been, who at that can wonder, or be angry?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And has he &s;till no plan, no &s;cheme for his future de&s;tination?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, none at all; and that it is makes him &s;o mi&s;erable, and being &s;o mi|&s;erable makes him &s;o ill, for Mr. Rupil &s;ays that with &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s upon his mind, he can never, in his pre&s;ent low &s;tate, get well. O it is melancholy to &s;ee how he is altered! and how he has lo&s;t all his fine &s;pirits! he that u&s;ed to be the life of us all!&mdash;And now he hardly ever &s;peaks a word, or if he does, he &s;ays &s;omething &s;o &s;orrowful that it cuts us to the &s;oul! But ye&s;terday, when my mother and I thought he was a&s;leep, he lifted up his head, and looked at us both with the tears in his eyes, which almo&s;t broke our hearts to &s;ee, and then, in a low voice, he &s;aid "what a lingering illne&s;s is this! Ah, my dear mo|ther, you and poor Henrietta ought to wi&s;h it quicker over! for &s;hould I recover, my life, hereafter, will but linger like this ill|ne&s;s.
<PB N="135" REF="134">
And afterwards he called out "what on earth is to become of me? I &s;hall never have health for the army, nor intere&s;t, nor means; what am I to do? &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the very prime of my life upon the bounty of a widowed mother! or, with &s;uch an educa|tion, &s;uch connections as mine, enter at la&s;t into &s;ome mean and &s;ordid bu&s;ine&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"he now le&s;s wants a phy&s;ician than a friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He has a friend, madam, a noble friend, would he but accept his &s;ervices; but he never &s;ees him without &s;uffering fre&s;h vexation, and his fever encrea&s;es after every vi&s;it he pays him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried Cecilia, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"I find we &s;hall not have an ea&s;y ta&s;k to manage him; but keep up your &s;pirits, and a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf he &s;hall not be lo&s;t, if it be po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave him."</Q></P>
<P>She then, though with much fearfulne&s;s of offending, once more made an offer of her pur&s;e. Mi&s;s Belfield no longer &s;tarted at the propo&s;al; yet, gratefully thanking her, &s;aid &s;he was not in any immediate di&s;|tre&s;s, and did not dare ri&s;k the di&s;plea&s;ure of her brother, unle&s;s driven to it by &s;everer nece&s;&s;ity. Cecilia, however, drew from her a promi&s;e that &s;he would apply to her in any &s;udden difficulty, and charged her never to
<PB N="136" REF="135">
think her&s;elf without a banker while her direction was known to her.</P>
<P>She then bid her adieu, and returned home; meditating the whole way upon &s;ome plan of employment and advantage for Mr. Belfield, which by clearing his pro|&s;pects, might revive his &s;pirits, and facili|tate his recovery: for &s;ince his mind was &s;o evidently the &s;eat of his di&s;ea&s;e, &s;he &s;aw that unle&s;s &s;he could do more for him, &s;he had yet done nothing.</P>
<P>Her meditation, however, turned to no account; &s;he could &s;ugge&s;t nothing, for &s;he was ignorant what was eligible to &s;ugge&s;t. The &s;tations and employments of men &s;he only knew by occa&s;ionally hearing that &s;uch were their profe&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch their &s;itua|tions in life; but with the means and gra|dations by which they aro&s;e to them &s;he was wholly unacquainted.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, her con&s;tant re&s;ource in all ca&s;es of difficulty, immediately occur|red to her as her mo&s;t able coun&s;ellor, and the determined by the fir&s;t opportunity to con&s;ult with him upon the &s;ubject, certain of advice the mo&s;t judicious from his ex|perience, and knowledge of the world.</P>
<P>But though &s;he re&s;ted upon him her &s;eri|ous expectations of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, another idea entered her mind not le&s;s plea&s;ant, though
<PB N="137" REF="136">
le&s;s promi&s;ing of utility: this was to men|tion her views to young Delvile. He was already, &s;he knew, well informed of the di&s;tre&s;s of Mr. Belfield, and &s;he hoped, by openly a&s;king his opinion, to confirm to him her freedom from any engagement with that gentleman, and convince him, at the &s;ame time, by her application to him&s;elf, that &s;he was equally clear of any tie with the Baronet.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A SYMPATHY.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day Cecilia had appointed to &s;pend in St. James's Square; and &s;he knew by experience that in its cour&s;e, &s;he &s;hould in all probability find &s;ome oppor|tunity of &s;peaking with Delvile alone.</P>
<P>This accordingly happened; for in the evening Mrs. Delvile quitted the room for a few moments to an&s;wer a letter. Cecilia then, left with her &s;on, &s;aid, after a little he&s;itation, <Q REND="inline">"Will you not think me very &s;trange if I &s;hould take the liberty to con|&s;ult you upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I already think you very &s;trange,"</Q> an|&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"&s;o &s;trange that I know not any one who at all re&s;embles you. But what is this con&s;ultation in which you will permit me to have a voice?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are acquainted, I believe, with the di&s;tre&s;s of Mr. Belfield?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am; and I think his &s;ituation the mo&s;t melancholy that can be imagined. I pity him with my whole &s;oul, and nothing would give me greater joy than an opportu|nity of &s;erving him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="138">
<Q REND="inline">"He is, indeed, much to be compa&s;|&s;ionated,"</Q> returned Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"and if &s;ome|thing is not &s;peedily done for him, I fear he will be utterly lo&s;t. The agitation of his mind baffles all the power of medicine, and till that is relieved, his health can never be re&s;tored. His &s;pirit, probably always too high for his rank in life, now &s;truggles again&s;t every attack of &s;ickne&s;s and of po|verty, in preference to yielding to his fate, and applying to his friends for their intere&s;t and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I mean not to vindicate his obduracy, yet I wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible it could be &s;urmounted. Indeed I dread to think what may become of him! feeling at pre|&s;ent nothing but wretchedne&s;s and pain, looking forward in future to nothing but ruin and de&s;pair!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no man,"</Q> cried young Del|vile, with emotion, <Q REND="inline">"who might not ra|ther envy than pity &s;ufferings which give ri&s;e to &s;uch compa&s;&s;ion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance he will not ac|cept,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"and, indeed, his mind is &s;uperior to receiving con&s;olation from &s;uch temporary relief; I wi&s;h him, therefore, to be put into &s;ome way of life by which his own talents, which have long enough amu&s;ed the world, may at length become &s;erviceable to him&s;elf. Do you think, Sir, this is po&s;&s;ible?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="139">
<Q REND="inline">"How do I rejoice,"</Q> cried Delvile, co|louring with plea&s;ure while he &s;poke, <Q REND="inline">"in this flattering concurrence of our opinions! &s;ee, madam,"</Q> taking from his pocket a let|ter, <Q REND="inline">"how I have been this very morning occupied, in endeavouring to procure for Mr. Belfield &s;ome employment by which his education might be rendered u&s;eful, and his parts redound to his own credit and ad|vantage."</Q></P>
<P>He then broke the &s;eal, and put into her hand a letter to a nobleman, who&s;e &s;on was &s;oon going abroad, &s;trongly recommending Belfield to him in capacity of a tutor.</P>
<P>A &s;ympathy of &s;entiment &s;o &s;triking im|pre&s;&s;ed them at the &s;ame moment with &s;ur|pri&s;e and e&s;teem; Delvile earne&s;tly regard|ed her with eyes of &s;peaking admiration, while the occa&s;ion of his notice rendered it too plea&s;ant to di&s;tre&s;s her, and filled her with an inward &s;atisfaction which brighten|ed her whole countenance.</P>
<P>She had only time, in a manner that &s;trongly marked her approbation, to return the letter, before Mrs. Delvile again made her appearance.</P>
<P>During the re&s;t of the evening but little was &s;aid; Cecilia was not talkative, and young Delvile was &s;o ab&s;ent, that three times his mother reminded him of an en|gagement to meet his father, who that night
<PB N="141" REF="140">
was expected at the Duke of Derwent's hou&s;e in town, before he heard that &s;he &s;poke to him, and three times more before, when he had heard, he obeyed.</P>
<P>Cecilia, when &s;he came back to Mr. Harrel's, found the hou&s;e full of company. She went into the drawing-room, but did not remain there long: &s;he was grave and thoughtful, &s;he wi&s;hed to be alone, and by the earlie&s;t opportunity, &s;tole away to her own apartment.</P>
<P>Her mind was now occupied by new ideas, and her fancy was bu&s;ied in the de|lineation of new pro&s;pects. She had been &s;truck from her fir&s;t meeting young Del|vile with an involuntary admiration of his manners and conver&s;ation; &s;he had found upon every &s;ucceeding interview &s;omething further to approve, and felt for him a ri&s;|ing partiality which made her always &s;ee him with plea&s;ure, and never part from him without a wi&s;h to &s;ee him again. Yet, as &s;he was not of that inflammable nature which is always ready to take fire, as her pa&s;&s;ions were under the controul of her rea|&s;on, and &s;he &s;uffered not her affections to triumph over her principles, &s;he &s;tarted at her danger the moment &s;he perceived it, and in&s;tantly determined to give no weak encou|ragement to a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which neither time nor intimacy had ju&s;tified. She denied
<PB N="142" REF="141">
her&s;elf the deluding &s;atisfaction of dwelling upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of his worth, was un|u&s;ually a&s;&s;iduous to occupy all her time, that her heart might have le&s;s lei&s;ure for imagination; and had &s;he found that his character degenerated from the promi&s;e of his appearance, the well regulated purity of her mind would &s;oon have enabled her to have driven him wholly from her thoughts.</P>
<P>Such was her &s;ituation when the circum|&s;tances of her affairs occa&s;ioned her becom|ing an inmate of his hou&s;e; and here &s;he grew le&s;s guarded, becau&s;e le&s;s clear-&s;ighted to the danger of negligence, for the fre|quency of their conver&s;ation allowed her little time to con&s;ider their effects. If at fir&s;t &s;he had been plea&s;ed with his deportment and elegance, upon intimacy &s;he was charmed with his di&s;po&s;ition and his behaviour; &s;he found him manly, generous, open-hearted and amiable, fond of literature, delighting in knowledge, kind in his temper, and &s;pi|rited in his actions.</P>
<P>Qualities &s;uch as the&s;e, when recom|mended by high birth, a &s;triking figure, and poli&s;hed manners, formed but a dange|rous companion for a young woman, who, without the guard of any former prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, was &s;o fervent an admirer of excel|lence as Cecilia. Her heart made no re&s;i&s;|tance, for the attack was too gentle and too
<PB N="143" REF="142">
gradual to alarm her vigilance, and there|fore, though always &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ure &s;he received from his &s;ociety, it was not till &s;he returned to Portman-Square, after hav|ing lived under the &s;ame roof with him for a fortnight, that &s;he was con&s;cious her happine&s;s was no longer in her own power.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel's hou&s;e, which had never plea&s;ed her, now became utterly di&s;gu&s;tful; &s;he was wearied and uncomfortable, yet, willing to attribute her unea&s;ine&s;s to any other than the true cau&s;e, &s;he fancied the hou&s;e it&s;elf was changed, and that all its inhabitants and vi&s;itors were more than u&s;u|ally di&s;agreeable: but this idle error was of &s;hort duration, the moment of &s;elf-convic|tion was at hand, and when Delvile pre|&s;ented her the letter he had written for Mr. Belfield, it fla&s;hed in her eyes!</P>
<P>This detection of the altered &s;tate of her mind opened to her views and her hopes a &s;cene entirely new, for neither the exertion of the mo&s;t active benevolence, nor the &s;teady cour&s;e of the mo&s;t virtuous conduct, &s;ufficed any longer to wholly engage her thoughts, or con&s;titute her felicity; &s;he had purpo&s;es that came nearer home, and cares that threatened to ab&s;orb in them&s;elves that heart and tho&s;e faculties which hitherto had only &s;eemed animated for the &s;ervice of others.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="143">
Yet this lo&s;s of mental freedom gave her not much unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;ince the choice of her heart, though involuntary, was approved by her principles, and confirmed by her judgment. Young Delvile's &s;ituation in life was ju&s;t what &s;he wi&s;hed, more elevated than her own, yet not &s;o exalted as to humble her with a &s;en&s;e of inferiority; his connections were honourable, his mother appeared to her the fir&s;t of women, his cha|racter and di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed formed to make her happy, and her own fortune was &s;o large, that to the &s;tate of his &s;he was in|different.</P>
<P>Delighted with &s;o flattering a union of inclination with propriety, &s;he now began to cheri&s;h the partiality &s;he at fir&s;t had re|pre&s;&s;ed, and thinking the future de&s;tination of her life already &s;ettled, looked forward with grateful joy to the pro&s;pect of ending her days with the man &s;he thought mo&s;t worthy to be entru&s;ted with the di&s;po&s;al of her fortune.</P>
<P>She had not, indeed, any certainty that the regard of young Delvile was reciprocal, but &s;he had every rea&s;on to believe he great|ly admired her, and to &s;u&s;pect that his mi&s;|taken notion of her prior engagement, fir&s;t with Mr. Belfield, and afterwards with Sir Robert Floyer, made him at pre&s;ent check tho&s;e &s;entiments in her favour which, when
<PB N="145" REF="144">
that error was removed, &s;he hoped to &s;ee encouraged.</P>
<P>Her purpo&s;e, therefore, was quietly to wait an explanation, which &s;he rather wi&s;h|ed retarded than forwarded, that her lei&s;ure and opportunity might be more for inve&s;|tigating his character, and &s;aving her&s;elf from repentance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A CONFLICT.</HEAD>
<P>THE day following this happy intel|lectual arrangement, Cecilia was vi&s;it|ed by Mr. Monckton. That gentleman, who had enquired for her immediately after the Harrels went to their villa, and who had flattered him&s;elf with reaping much advantage from their ab&s;ence, by frequent meetings and confidential di&s;cour&s;es, &s;uffer|ed the &s;evere&s;t mortification when he found that her &s;tay in town rendered her not the le&s;s inacce&s;&s;ible to him, &s;ince he had no per&s;onal acquaintance with the Delviles, and could not venture to pre&s;ent him&s;elf at their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He was now received by her with more than u&s;ual plea&s;ure; the time had &s;eemed long to her &s;ince &s;he had conver&s;ed with him, and &s;he was eager to a&s;k his coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her affairs. She related to him the motives which had induced her to go to St. James' Square, and the incorri|gible ob&s;tinacy with which Mr. Harrel &s;till continued to encourage the addre&s;&s;es of Sir Robert Floyer; &s;he earne&s;tly entreated
<PB N="147" REF="146">
him to become her agent in a bu&s;ine&s;s to which &s;he was unequal, by expo&s;tulating in her cau&s;e with Mr. Harrel, and by calling upon Sir Robert him&s;elf to in&s;i&s;t upon his foregoing his unauthori&s;ed preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton li&s;tened eagerly to her account and reque&s;t, and when &s;he had fini&s;hed, a&s;&s;ured her he would deliberate upon each circum&s;tance of the affair, and then maturely weigh every method he could devi&s;e, to extricate her from an embarra&s;&s;|ment which now grew far too &s;erious to be &s;afely neglected.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not, however,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"either act or give my opinion without further enquiry, as I am confident there is a my&s;tery in this bu&s;ine&s;s which lies deeper than we can at pre&s;ent fathom. Mr. Har|rel has doubtle&s;s purpo&s;es of his own to an|&s;wer by this pretended zeal for Sir Robert; nor is it difficult to conjecture what they may be. Friend&s;hip, in a man of his light ca&s;t, is a mere cover, a mere name, to con|ceal a connection which has its ba&s;is &s;olely in the licentious convenience of borrowing money, going to the &s;ame gaming hou&s;e, and mutually communicating and boa&s;ting their mutual vices and intrigues, while, all the time, their regard for each other is equally hollow with their regard for truth and integrity."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="147">
He then cautioned her to be extremely careful with re&s;pect to any money tran&s;ac|tions with Mr. Harrel, who&s;e &s;plendid ex|travagance he a&s;&s;ured her was univer&s;ally known to exceed his fortune.</P>
<P>The countenance of Cecilia during this exhortation was te&s;timony &s;ufficient to the penetrating eyes of Mr. Monckton that his advice came not too &s;oon: a &s;u&s;picion of the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e &s;peedily occurred to him, and he que&s;tioned her minutely upon the &s;ubject. She endeavoured to avoid making him any an&s;wer, but his di&s;|cernment was too keen for her inartificial eva&s;ion, and he very &s;oon gathered all the particulars of her tran&s;actions with Mr. Harrel.</P>
<P>He was le&s;s alarmed at the &s;um &s;he had lent him, which was rather within his ex|pectations, than at the method &s;he had been induced to take to procure it. He repre|&s;ented to her in the &s;tronge&s;t manner the danger of impo&s;ition, nay of ruin, from the extortions and the craft of money-lenders; and he charged her upon no con&s;ideration to be tempted or per&s;uaded again to have recour&s;e to &s;uch perilous expedients.</P>
<P>She promi&s;ed the mo&s;t attentive ob&s;erv|ance of his advice: and then told him the acquaintance &s;he had made with Mi&s;s Bel|field, and her &s;orrow for the &s;ituation of her
<PB N="149" REF="148">
brother; though, &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent with the plan of young Delvile, &s;he now gave up her de&s;ign of &s;oliciting his coun&s;el.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this conver&s;ation, a note was delivered to her from Mr. Delvile &s;e|nior, acquainting her with his return to town, and begging the favour of her to call in St. James's Square the next morning, as he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her upon &s;ome bu&s;i|ne&s;s of importance.</P>
<P>The eager manner in which Cecilia ac|cepted this invitation, and her repeated and earne&s;t exclamation of wonder at what Mr. Delvile could have to &s;ay, pa&s;t not unnoticed by Mr. Monckton; he in|&s;tantly turned the di&s;cour&s;e from the Bel|fields, the Harrels, and the Baronet, to en|quire how &s;he had &s;pent her time during her vi&s;it in St. James' Square, and what was her opinion of the family after her late op|portunities of intimacy?</P>
<P>Cecilia an&s;wered that &s;he had yet &s;een nothing more of Mr. Delvile, who had been ab&s;ent the whole time, but with equal readine&s;s and plea&s;ure &s;he replied to all his que&s;tions concerning his lady, expatiating with warmth and fervour upon her many rare and e&s;timable qualities.</P>
<P>But when the &s;ame interrogatories were transferred to the &s;on, &s;he &s;poke no longer with the &s;ame ea&s;e, nor with her u&s;ual
<PB N="150" REF="149">
promptitude of &s;incerity; &s;he was embar|ra&s;&s;ed, her an&s;wers were &s;hort, and &s;he en|deavoured to ha&s;ten from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton remarked this change with the mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive quickne&s;s, but, forcing a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"Have you yet,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"ob&s;erved the family compact in which tho&s;e people are bound to be&s;iege you, and draw you into their &s;nares?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed,"</Q> cried Cecilia, much hurt by the que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure no &s;uch com|pact has been formed; and I am &s;ure, too, that if you knew them better, you would your&s;elf be the fir&s;t to admire and do them ju&s;tice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I know them already; I do not, indeed, vi&s;it them, but I am perfectly acquainted with their characters, which have been drawn to me by tho&s;e who are mo&s;t clo&s;ely connected with them, and who have had opportunities of in&s;pection which I hope will never fall to your &s;hare, &s;ince I am &s;atisfied the trial would pain, though the proof would con|vince you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What then have you heard of them?"</Q> cried Cecilia, with much earne&s;tne&s;s: <Q REND="inline">"it is, at lea&s;t, not po&s;&s;ible any ill can be &s;aid of Mrs. Delvile."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Delvile is not nearer perfection than
<PB N="151" REF="150">
the re&s;t of her family, &s;he has only more art in di&s;gui&s;ing her foibles; becau&s;e, tho' &s;he is the daughter of pride, &s;he is the &s;lave of intere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you have been greatly misin|formed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia warmly; <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Del|vile is the noble&s;t of women! &s;he may, in|deed, from her very exaltation, have ene|mies, but they are the enemies of envy, not of re&s;entment, enemies rai&s;ed by &s;u|perior merit, not excited by injury or pro|vocation!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will know her better hereafter;"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton calmly, <Q REND="inline">"I only hope your knowledge will not be purcha&s;ed by the &s;acrifice of your happine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what knowledge of her, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;tarting, <Q REND="inline">"can have power to put my happine&s;s in any danger?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will tell you,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"with all the openne&s;s you have a claim to from my regard, and then leave to time to &s;hew if I am mi&s;taken. The Delvile family, not|with&s;tanding its o&s;tentatious magnificence, I can &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, is poor in every branch, alike lineal and collateral."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But is it therefore the le&s;s e&s;timable?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, becau&s;e the more rapacious. And while they count on each &s;ide Dukes, Earls and Barons in their genealogy, the very wealth with which, through your means, they project the &s;upport of their in&s;olence,
<PB N="152" REF="151">
and which they will gra&s;p with all the gree|dine&s;s of avarice, they will think honoured by being employed in their &s;ervice, while the in&s;trument, all amiable as &s;he is, by which they attain it, will be con&s;tantly held down as the di&s;grace of their alliance."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;tung to the &s;oul by this &s;peech, ro&s;e from her chair, unwilling to an&s;wer it, yet unable to conceal how much it &s;hocked her. Mr. Monckton, perceiving her emo|tion, followed her, and taking her hand, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I would not give this warning to one I thought too weak to profit from it; but as I am well informed of the u&s;e that is meant to be made of your fortune, and the abu&s;e that will follow of your&s;elf, I think it right to prepare you for their artifices, which merely to point out may render abortive."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, too much di&s;turbed to thank him, drew back her hand, and continued &s;ilent. Mr. Monckton, reading through her di&s;plea&s;ure the &s;tate of her affections, &s;aw with terror the greatne&s;s of the danger which threatened him. He found, how|ever, that the pre&s;ent was no time for en|forcing objections, and perceiving he had already gone too far, though he was by no means di&s;po&s;ed to recant, he thought it mo&s;t prudent to retreat, and let her meditate upon his exhortation while its impre&s;&s;ion was yet &s;trong in her mind.</P>
<P>He would now, therefore, have taken
<PB N="153" REF="152">
leave; but Cecilia, endeavouring to recol|lect her&s;elf, and fully per&s;uaded that how|ever he had &s;hocked her, he had only her intere&s;t in view, &s;topt him, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"You think me, perhaps, ungrateful, but be|lieve me I am not; I mu&s;t, however, ac|knowledge that your cen&s;ure of Mrs. Del|vile hurts me extremely. Indeed I cannot doubt her worthine&s;s, I mu&s;t &s;till, there|fore, plead for her, and I hope the time may come when you will allow I have not pleaded unju&s;tly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"I am at lea&s;t &s;ure you can never plead vainly. I give up, therefore, to your opinion my attack of Mrs. Delvile, and am willing from your commendations to &s;uppo&s;e her the be&s;t of the race. Nay, I will even own that perhaps Mr. Delvile him&s;elf, as well as his lady, might pa&s;s through life and give but little offence, had they only them&s;elves to think of, and no &s;on to &s;timulate their arrogance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is the &s;on, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia faintly, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o much the mo&s;t culpable?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;on, I believe,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"is at lea&s;t the chief incentive to in&s;olence and o&s;tentation in the parents, &s;ince it is for his &s;ake they covet with &s;uch avidity honours and riches, &s;ince they plume them&s;elves upon regarding him as the &s;upport of their
<PB N="154" REF="153">
name and family, and &s;ince their pride in him even &s;urpa&s;&s;es their pride in their line|age and them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah! thought Cecilia, and of &s;uch a &s;on who could help being proud!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Their purpo&s;e, therefore,"</Q> he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"is to &s;ecure through his means your fortune, which they will no &s;ooner obtain, than, to my certain knowledge, they mean in&s;tantly, and mo&s;t unmerci|fully, to employ it in repairing all their di|lapidated e&s;tates."</Q></P>
<P>And then he quitted the &s;ubject; and, with that guarded warmth which accompa|nied all his expre&s;&s;ions, told her he would carefully watch for her honour and welfare, and, repeating his promi&s;e of endeavouring to di&s;cover the tie by which Mr. Harrel &s;eemed bound to the Baronet, he left her&mdash;a prey him&s;elf to an anxiety yet more &s;evere than that with which he had filled her! He now &s;aw all his long cheri&s;hed hopes in danger of final de&s;truction, and &s;uddenly ca&s;t upon the brink of a precipice, where, while he &s;truggled to protect them from falling, his eyes were dazzled by beholding them totter.</P>
<P>Mean while Cecilia, di&s;turbed from the calm of &s;oft &s;erenity to which &s;he had yield|ed every avenue of her &s;oul, now looked forward with di&s;tru&s;t and unea&s;ine&s;s, even
<PB N="155" REF="154">
to the completion of the views which but a few minutes before had compri&s;ed all her notions of felicity. The alliance which &s;o lately had &s;eemed wholly unexceptionable, now appeared teeming with objections, and threatening with difficulties. The repre|&s;entations of Mr. Monckton had cruelly mortified her; well acquainted with his knowledge of the world, and wholly un&s;u&s;|picious of his &s;elfi&s;h motives, &s;he gave to his a&s;&s;ertions involuntary credit, and even while &s;he attempted to combat them, they made upon her mind an impre&s;&s;ion &s;carce ever to be era&s;ed.</P>
<P>Full, therefore, of doubt and inquietude, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the night in di&s;comfort and irre|&s;olution, now determining to give way to her feelings, and now to be wholly governed by the coun&s;el of Mr. Monckton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. AN EXPECTATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN this di&s;po&s;ition of mind Cecilia the next morning obeyed the &s;ummons of Mr. Delvile, and for the fir&s;t time went to St. James' Square in a humour to look for evil in&s;tead of good, and meanne&s;s in&s;tead of noblene&s;s.</P>
<P>She was &s;hewn into an apartment where &s;he found Mr. Delvile alone, and was re|ceived by him, as u&s;ual, with the mo&s;t &s;tately &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>When &s;he was &s;eated, <Q REND="inline">"I have given you, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"the trouble of calling, in order to di&s;cu&s;s with you the in|ternal &s;tate of your affairs; a duty which, at this juncture, I hold to be incumbent upon my character. The delicacy due to your &s;ex would certainly have induced me to wait upon you my&s;elf for this purpo&s;e, but for the rea&s;ons I have already hinted to you, of fearing the people with whom you live might think it nece&s;&s;ary to return my vi&s;it. Per&s;ons of low origin are commonly in tho&s;e matters the mo&s;t forward. Not, however, that I would prejudice you again&s;t

them; though, for my&s;elf, it is fit I remem|ber that a general and indi&s;criminate ac|quaintance, by levelling all ranks, does in|jury to the rites of &s;ociety."</Q></P>
<P>Ah! thought Cecilia, how infallible is Mr. Monckton! amd how inevitably, in a family of which Mr. Delvile is the head, &s;hould I be cruelly <HI>held down, as the di&s;grace of their alliance!</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have applied,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"to Mrs. Delvile, to know if the communica|tion which I had recommended to you, and to which &s;he had promi&s;ed her attention, had yet pa&s;&s;ed; but I am informed you have not &s;poken to her upon the &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had nothing, Sir, to communicate,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and I had hoped, as Mrs. Delvile made no enquiries, &s;he was &s;atisfied &s;he had nothing to hear."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With re&s;pect to enquiries,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I fear you are not &s;ufficiently aware of the di&s;tance between a lady of Mrs. Delvile's rank, both by birth and alliance, and &s;uch a young woman as Mrs. Harrel, who&s;e ance&s;tors, but a &s;hort time &s;ince, were mere Suffolk farmers. But I beg your par|don;&mdash;I mean not any reflection upon yours: I have always heard they were very worthy people. And a farmer is certainly a very re&s;pectable per&s;on. Your father, I
<PB N="158" REF="157">
think, no more than the Dean your uncle, did nothing in that way him&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, drily, and much provoked by this contemptuous courte&s;y.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have always been told he was a very good &s;ort of man: I knew none of the fa|mily my&s;elf, but the Dean. His connec|tions with the Bi&s;hop of &mdash;, my relation, put him often in my way. Though his naming me for one of his tru&s;tees, I mu&s;t own, was rather extraordinary; but I mean not to hurt you; on the contrary, I &s;hould be much concerned to give you any unea&s;i|ne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Again Mr. Monckton aro&s;e in the mind of Cecilia, and again &s;he acknowledged the truth of his &s;trictures; and though &s;he much wondered in what an harrangue &s;o pompous was to end, her di&s;gu&s;t &s;o far con|quered her curio&s;ity, that without hearing it, &s;he wi&s;hed her&s;elf away.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To return,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">to my purpo&s;e. The pre&s;ent period of your life is &s;uch as to render advice particularly &s;ea&s;onable; I am &s;orry, therefore, as I before &s;aid, you have not di&s;clo&s;ed your &s;ituation to Mrs. Delvile. A young lady on the point of making an e&s;tabli&s;hment, and with many engagements in her power, is extremely liable to be mi&s;|taken in her judgment, and therefore &s;hould
<PB N="159" REF="158">
&s;olicit in&s;truction from tho&s;e who are able to acquaint her what connection would be mo&s;t to her advantage. One thing, how|ever, I am happy to commend, the young man who was wounded in the duel&mdash;I cannot recollect his name&mdash;is, I hear, to|tally out of the que&s;tion."</Q></P>
<P>What next? thought Cecilia; though &s;till &s;he gave him no interruption, for the haughtine&s;s of his manner was repul&s;ive to reply.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My de&s;ign, therefore, is to &s;peak to you of Sir Robert Floyer. When I had la&s;t the plea&s;ure of addre&s;&s;ing you upon this &s;ubject, you may probably remember my voice was in his favour; but I then regard|ed him merely as the rival of an incon&s;ider|able young man, to re&s;cue you from whom he appeared an eligible per&s;on. The affair is now altered, that young man is thought of no more, and another rival comes for|ward, to whom Sir Robert is as incon&s;ider|able as the fir&s;t rival was to Sir Robert."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;tarted at this information, live|lier &s;en&s;ations &s;timulated her curio&s;ity, and &s;urmi&s;es in which &s;he was mo&s;t deeply in|tere&s;ted quickened her attention.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This rival,"</Q> proceeded he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould imagine no young lady would a moment he&s;itate in electing; he is every way the &s;u|perior of Sir Robert except in fortune, and
<PB N="160" REF="159">
the deficiencies of that the &s;plendour of your own may amply &s;upply."</Q></P>
<P>The deepe&s;t crim&s;on now tinged the cheeks of Cecilia; the prophecy of Mr. Monckton &s;eemed immediately fulfilling, and &s;he trembled with a ri&s;ing conflict be|tween her approbation of the offer, and her dread of its con&s;equences.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not, indeed,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"in what e&s;timation you may have been accu&s;tomed to hold rank and connection, nor whether you are impre&s;&s;ed with a pro|per &s;en&s;e of their &s;uperiority and value; for early prejudices are not ea&s;ily rooted out, and tho&s;e who have lived chiefly with mo|nied people, regard even birth in&s;elf as un|important when compared with wealth."</Q></P>
<P>The colour which fir&s;t glowed in the cheeks of Cecilia from expectation, now ro&s;e yet higher from re&s;entment: &s;he thought her&s;elf already in&s;ulted by a prelude &s;o o&s;|tentatious and humiliating to the propo&s;als which were to follow; and &s;he angrily de|termined, with whatever pain to her heart, to a&s;&s;ert her own dignity by refu&s;ing them at once, too well &s;atisfied by what &s;he now &s;aw of the pre&s;ent, that Mr. Monckton had been ju&s;t in his prediction of the future.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your rejection, therefore,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"of this honourable offer, may per|haps have been merely the con&s;equence of
<PB N="161" REF="160">
the principles in which you have been edu|cated.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Rejection?"</Q> interrupted Cecilia, amaz|ed, <Q REND="inline">"what rejection, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you not refu&s;ed the propo&s;als of my Lord Ernolf for his &s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Ernolf? never! nor have I ever &s;een either his Lord&s;hip or his &s;on but in public."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> replied Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is little to the purpo&s;e; where the connexion is a proper one, a young lady of delicacy has only to accede to it. But though this re|jection came not immediately from your&s;elf, it had doubtle&s;s your concurrence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It had not, Sir, even my knowledge."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your alliance then with Sir Robert Floyer is probably nearer a conclu&s;ion than I had imagined, for otherwi&s;e Mr. Harrel would not, without con&s;ulting you, have given the Earl &s;o determinate an an&s;wer.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, impatiently, <Q REND="inline">"my alliance with him was never more di&s;tant, nor do I mean it &s;hould ever ap|proach more near."</Q></P>
<P>She was now little di&s;po&s;ed for further conver&s;ation. Her heroic de&s;ign of refu&s;ing young Delvile by no means reconciled her to the di&s;covery &s;he now made that he had not meant to addre&s;s her; and though &s;he was provoked and fretted at this new proof
<PB N="162" REF="161">
that Mr. Harrel &s;crupled neither a&s;&s;ertions nor actions to make her engagement with Sir Robert credited, her di&s;appointment in finding that Mr. Delvile, in&s;tead of plead|ing the cau&s;e of his &s;on, was exerting his intere&s;t for another per&s;on, affected her &s;o much more nearly, that notwith&s;tanding he &s;till continued his parading harangue, &s;he &s;carcely knew even the &s;ubject of his di&s;|cour&s;e, and &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of a ce&s;&s;ation to ri&s;e and take her leave.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked her if &s;he would not call upon Mrs. Delvile; but de&s;irous to be alone, &s;he declined the invitation; he then charged her to proceed no further with Sir Robert till he had made &s;ome enquiries concerning Lord Ernolf, and graciou&s;ly promi&s;ing his protection and coun&s;el, &s;uffered her to de|part.</P>
<P>Cecilia now perceived &s;he might plan her rejections, or &s;tudy her dignity at her lei&s;ure, for neither Mr. Delvile nor his &s;on &s;eemed in any ha&s;te to put her fortitude to the proof. With regard, therefore, to their plots and intentions, Mr. Monckton &s;he found was wrong, but with re&s;pect to their conduct and &s;entiments, &s;he had every rea|&s;on to believe him right: and though her heart refu&s;ed to rejoice in e&s;caping a trial of its &s;trength, her judgment was &s;o well con|vinced that his painting was from the life,
<PB N="163" REF="162">
that &s;he determined to conquer her partiali|ty for young Delvile, &s;ince &s;he looked for|ward to nothing but mortification in a con|nexion with his family.</P>

<P>WITH this intention, and every fa|culty of her mind ab&s;orbed in reflect|ing upon the rea&s;ons which gave ri&s;e to it, &s;he returned to Portman-&s;quare.</P>
<P>As her chair was carried into the hall, &s;he ob&s;erved, with &s;ome alarm, a look of con&s;ternation among the &s;ervants, and an appearance of confu&s;ion in the whole hou&s;e.

<P>Frightened and amazed, &s;he &s;topt &s;hort, irre&s;olute which way to go; but, ha&s;tily returning, he beckoned her to follow him.</P>
<P>She obeyed, and he led her to the library. He then &s;hut the door, and abruptly &s;eizing her hand, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, I am ruined!&mdash;I am undone!&mdash;I am bla&s;ted for ever!"</Q></P>

<P><PB N="165" REF="164">

<P><Q REND="inline">"O fie! fie!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"let me call her, I beg; you &s;hould con&s;ult with her in this di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;eek comfort from her affection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From her affection?"</Q> repeated he, fiercely, <Q REND="inline">"from her hatred you mean! do you not know that &s;he, too, is ruined? Oh pa&s;t redemption ruined!&mdash;and yet that I &s;hould he&s;itate, that I &s;hould a moment he&s;itate, to conclude the whole bu&s;ine&s;s at once!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How dreadful!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"what horrible thing has happened?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have undone Pri&s;cilla!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I have bla&s;ted my credit! I have de|&s;troyed&mdash;no, not yet quite de&s;troyed my|&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yet nor ever!"</Q> cried Cecilia, who&s;e agitation now almo&s;t equalled his own, <Q REND="inline">"be not &s;o de&s;perate, I conjure you! &s;peak to me more intelligibly,&mdash;what does all this mean? How has it come to pa&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My debts!&mdash;my creditors!&mdash;one way only,"</Q> &s;triking his hand upon his forehead, <Q REND="inline">"is left for me!"</Q></P>

<P>She &s;topt; checked in the full career of her overflowing compa&s;&s;ion, by a &s;en&s;e of the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of its object; and by the remembrance of the injunctions of Mr. Monckton.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What will you undertake?"</Q> cried he, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"I know you are an angel!&mdash;tell me, what will you undertake?</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, retreating, <Q REND="inline">"I can indeed do nothing! if their demands are &s;o high, I <HI>ought</HI> to do nothing."</Q></P>
<P>She would then have quitted him, not more &s;hocked at his &s;ituation, than indig|nant at the wilful extravagance which had occa&s;ioned it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Stay,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"and hear me!"</Q> then, lowering his voice, <Q REND="inline">"&s;eek out,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"your unfortunate friend,&mdash;go to the poor ruined Pri&s;cilla,&mdash;prepare her for tidings of horror! and do not, though you renounce Me, do not abandon Her!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, fiercely pa&s;&s;ing her, he was him|&s;elf leaving the room; but Cecilia, alarmed by the fury of his manner, called out, <Q REND="inline">"What is it you mean? what tidings of horror? whither are you going?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To hell!"</Q> cried he, and ru&s;hed out of the apartment.</P>
<P>Cecilia &s;creamed aloud, and conjuring him to hear her, ran after him; he paid her no regard, but, flying fa&s;ter than &s;he had power to pur&s;ue, reached his own dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;hut him&s;elf into it with violence, and ju&s;t as &s;he arrived at the door, turned the key, and bolted it.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167">
Her terror was now inexpre&s;&s;ible; &s;he believed him in the very act of &s;uicide, and her refu&s;al of a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;eemed the &s;ignal for the deed: her whole fortune, at that moment, was valuele&s;s and unimportant to her, compared with the pre&s;ervation of a fellow-creature: &s;he called out with all the vehemence of agony to beg he would open the door, and eagerly promi&s;ed by all that was &s;acred to do every thing in her power to &s;ave him.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words he opened it; his face was totally without colour, and he gra&s;ped a razor in his hand.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have &s;topt me,"</Q> &s;aid he, in a voice &s;carce audible, <Q REND="inline">"at the very mo|ment I had gathered courage for the blow: but if indeed you will a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I will &s;hut this up,&mdash;if not, I will &s;teep it in my blood!"</Q></P>

to entering into an engagement for &s;he knew not what, with a man who&s;e actions &s;he condemned, and who&s;e prin|ciples &s;he abhorred, made all her fright now give way to indignation, and, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, &s;he angrily an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I will not &s;wear!&mdash;but yet, all that is rea&s;onable, all that is friendly&mdash;"</Q></P>

<P>A noi&s;e was now heard below &s;tairs, at which Cecilia, who had not dared call for help le&s;t &s;he &s;hould quicken his de&s;peration, was &s;ecretly beginning to rejoice, when, &s;tarting at the &s;ound, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I be|lieve you are too late!&mdash;the ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ians have already &s;eized my hou&s;e!"</Q> then, endea|vouring to force her out of the room, <Q REND="inline">"Go,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"to my wife;&mdash;I want to be alone!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh give me fir&s;t,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that

<P><Q REND="inline">"I do not trifle! indeed I do not!"</Q> cried Cecilia, holding by his arm: <Q REND="inline">"try, put me to the proof!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Swear, &s;olemnly &s;wear, to empty my hou&s;e of the&s;e creditors this moment!"</Q></P>

<P>Cecilia, who&s;e heart &s;unk within her at the &s;olemn promi&s;e &s;he had given, the men|tion
<PB N="171" REF="170">
of the Jew, and the arduous ta&s;k &s;he had undertaken, quitted him without re|ply, and was going to her own room, to compo&s;e her hurried &s;pirits, and con&s;ider what &s;teps &s;he had to take, when hearing the noi&s;e in the hall grow louder, &s;he &s;topt to li&s;ten, and catching &s;ome words that greatly alarmed her, went half way down &s;tairs, when &s;he was met by Davi&s;on, Mr. Harrel's man, of whom &s;he enquired into the occa&s;ion of the di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered that he mu&s;t go imme|diately to his ma&s;ter, for the bailiffs were coming into the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>The man flew to obey her; and Cecilia, finding &s;he had time neither for deliberation nor regret, and dreading le&s;t Mr. Harrel, by hearing of the arrival of the bailiffs, &s;hould relap&s;e into de&s;pair, determined to call to her aid all the courage, prudence, and judgment &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and, &s;ince to act &s;he was compelled, endeavour with her be&s;t ability, to &s;ave his credit, and retrieve his affairs."</P>
<P>The moment Mr. Arnott came, &s;he or|dered

Davi&s;on to ha&s;ten to his ma&s;ter, and watch his motions.</P>

<P>Cecilia, however, per&s;i&s;ted, and with evident reluctance he obeyed her.</P>
<P>While &s;he waited his return, Davi&s;on came from Mr. Harrel, who had ordered him to run in&s;tantly for the Jew.</P>

Mr. Arnott was more than half an hour with the people; and when, at la&s;t, he returned, his countenance immediately pro|claimed the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his errand.

<P>Cecilia, amazed and confounded, &s;tarted and cla&s;ped her hands, calling out, <Q REND="inline">"What mu&s;t I do! to what have I bound my&s;elf! and how can I an&s;wer to my con&s;cience,&mdash;to my &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;al, &s;uch an abu&s;e of &s;o large a part of my fortune!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Arnott could make no an&s;wer; and they &s;tood looking at each other in &s;ilent irre&s;olution, till Davi&s;on brought in|telligence that the Jew was already come, and waited to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what can I &s;ay to him?"</Q> cried &s;he, more and more agitated; <Q REND="inline">"I under|&s;tand nothing of u&s;ury; how am I to deal with him?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Arnott then confe&s;&s;ed that he &s;hould him&s;elf have in&s;tantly been bail for his brother, but that his fortune, originally not large, was now &s;o much impaired by the many debts which from time to time he had paid for him, that as he hoped &s;ome day to have a family of his own, he dared not run a ri&s;k by which he might be utterly ruined, and the le&s;s, as his &s;i&s;ter had at Violet Bank been prevailed upon to give up her &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>This account, which explained the late

unea&s;ine&s;s of Mrs. Harrel, &s;till encrea&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;s of Cecilia; and every moment &s;he obtained for reflection, augmented her re|luctance to parting with &s;o large a &s;um of money for &s;o worthle&s;s an object, and added &s;trength to her re&s;entment for the unju&s;tifiable menaces which had extorted from her &s;uch a promi&s;e. Yet not an in&s;tant would &s;he li&s;ten to Mr. Arnott's offer of fulfilling her engagement, and charged him, as he con&s;idered her own &s;elf-e&s;teem worth her keeping, not to urge to her a propo&s;al &s;o ungenerous and &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P>Davi&s;on now came again to ha&s;ten her, and &s;aid that the Jew was with his ma&s;|ter, and they both impatiently expected her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, half di&s;tracted with her uncer|tainty how to act, changed colour at this me&s;&s;age, and exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Oh Mr. Arnott, run I be&s;eech you for Mr. Monckton! bring him hither directly,&mdash;if any body can &s;ave me it is him; but if I go back to Mr. Harrel, I know it will be all over!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Arnott, <Q REND="inline">"I will run to him this moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet no!&mdash;&s;top!&mdash;"</Q> cried the trem|bling Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"he can now do me no good,&mdash;his coun&s;el will arrive too late to &s;erve me,&mdash;it cannot call back the oath I have given! it cannot, compul&s;atory as it
<PB N="176" REF="175">
was, make me break it, and not be mi&s;e|rable for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>This idea &s;ufficed to determine her; and the apprehen&s;ion of &s;elf-reproach, &s;hould the threat of Mr. Harrel be put in exe|cution, was more in&s;upportable to her blamele&s;s and upright mind, than any lo&s;s or diminution which her fortune could &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>Slowly however, with tardy and un|willing &s;teps, her judgement repugnant, and her &s;pirit repining, &s;he obeyed the &s;ummons of Mr. Harrel, who, impatient of her de|lay, came forward to meet her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"there is not a moment to be lo&s;t; this good man will bring you any &s;um of money, upon a proper con&s;ideration, that you will com|mand; but if he is not immediately com|mi&s;&s;ioned, and the&s;e cur&s;ed fellows are not got out of my hou&s;e, the affair will be blown,"</Q>&mdash;and what will follow, added he, lowering his voice, <Q REND="inline">"I will not again frighten you by repeating, though I &s;hall never recant."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia turned from him in horror; and, with a faltering voice and heavy heart, entreated Mr. Arnott to &s;ettle for her with the Jew.</P>
<P>Large as was the &s;um, &s;he was &s;o near being of age, and her &s;ecurity was &s;o good,
<PB N="177" REF="176">
that the tran&s;action was &s;oon fini&s;hed: 7500<HI>l.</HI> was received of the Jew, Mr. Har|rel gave Cecilia his bond for the payment, the creditors were &s;atisfied, the bailiffs were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the hou&s;e was &s;oon re&s;tored to its cu&s;tomary appearance of &s;plendid gaiety.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, who during this &s;cene had &s;hut her&s;elf up in her own room to weep and lament, now flew to Cecilia, and in a tran&s;port of joy and gratitude, thanked her upon her knees for thus pre&s;erving her from utter ruin: the gentle Mr. Arnott &s;eemed uncertain whether mo&s;t to grieve or rejoice; and Mr. Harrel repeatedly prote&s;ted &s;he &s;hould have the &s;ole guidance of his future conduct.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e, the hope of his amend|ment, and the joy &s;he had expanded, &s;ome|what revived the &s;pirits of Cecilia; who, however, deeply affected by what had pa&s;&s;ed, ha&s;tened from them all to her own room.</P>
<P>She had now parted with 8050<HI>l.</HI> to Mr. Harrel, without any &s;ecurity when or how it was to be paid; and that ardour of benevolence which taught her to value her riches merely as they enabled her to do good and generous actions, was here of no avail to con&s;ole or reward her, for her gift was compelled, and its receiver was all but dete&s;ted. <Q REND="inline">"How much better,"</Q> cried &s;he,
<PB N="178" REF="177">
<Q REND="inline">"would this have been be&s;towed upon the amiable Mi&s;s Belfield! or upon her noble|minded, though proud-&s;pirited brother! and how much le&s;s a &s;um would have made the virtuous and indu&s;trious Hills ea&s;y and happy for life! but here, to become the tool of the extravagance I abhor! to be made re&s;pon&s;ible for the luxury I condemn! to be liberal in oppo&s;ition to my principles, and lavi&s;h in defiance of my judgment!&mdash;Oh that my much-deceived Uncle had bet|ter known to what dangerous hands he com|mitted me! and that my weak and unhappy friend had met with a worthier protector of her virtue and &s;afety!"</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon, however, as &s;he recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock of her reflections, &s;he turned her thoughts from her&s;elf to the formation of &s;ome plan that might, at lea&s;t, render her donation of &s;erious and la&s;ting u&s;e. The &s;ignal &s;ervice &s;he had ju&s;t done them gave her at pre&s;ent an a&s;cendency over the Har|rels, which &s;he hoped, if immediately ex|erted, might prevent the return of &s;o cala|mitous a &s;cene, by engaging them both to an immediate change of conduct. But un|equal her&s;elf to contriving expedients for this purpo&s;e that might not ea&s;ily be con|troverted, &s;he determined to &s;end the next morning a petition to Mr. Monckton to call upon her, reveal to him the whole
<PB N="179" REF="178">
tran&s;action, and entreat him to &s;ugge&s;t to her what, with mo&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he might offer to their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing in her mind, on the evening of the day in which &s;he had &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed the right of giving coun|&s;el, &s;he was &s;ummoned to tea.</P>
<P>She found Mr. Harrel and his lady en|gaged in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e; as &s;oon as &s;he appeared, the former &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mi&s;s Beverley, after the extraordinary kindne&s;s you have &s;hewn me this morning, you will not, I am &s;ure, deny me one trifling favour which I mean to a&s;k this evening."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"that I am &s;ure &s;he will not, when &s;he knows that our future appearance in the world depends upon her granting it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not wi&s;h to refu&s;e it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is nothing in the world,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"but to go with us to-night to the Pantheon.</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was &s;truck with the utmo&s;t indig|nation at this propo&s;al; that the man who in the morning had an execution in his hou&s;e, &s;hould langui&s;h in the evening for the amu&s;ement of a public place,&mdash;that he who but a few hours before was plunging uncalled into eternity, &s;hould, while the intended in&s;trument of death was yet &s;carce

cold from the gra&s;p of his hand, deliberately court a return of his di&s;tre&s;s, by in&s;tantly recurring to the methods which had in|volved him in it, irritated and &s;hocked her beyond even a wi&s;h of di&s;gui&s;ing her di&s;|plea&s;ure, and therefore, after an expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, &s;he gave a cold, but ab&s;olute denial.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, &s;omewhat confu&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"you do not under&s;tand the motives of our reque&s;t. The unfortunate affair of this morning is very likely to &s;pread pre&s;ently all over the town; the only refutation that can be given to it, is by our all appearing in public before any body knows whether to believe it or not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do, my deare&s;t friend,"</Q> cried his lady, <Q REND="inline">"oblige me by your compliance; indeed our whole reputation depends upon it. I made an engagement ye&s;terday to go with Mrs. Mears, and if I di&s;appoint her, every body will be gue&s;&s;ing the rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At lea&s;t,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>my</HI> going can an&s;wer no purpo&s;e to you: pray, therefore, do not a&s;k me; I am ill di&s;po&s;ed for &s;uch &s;ort of amu&s;ement, and have by no means your opinion of its nece&s;&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But if we do not <HI>all</HI> go,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"we do almo&s;t nothing: you are known to live with us, and your appearance at this critical time is important to our credit. If this misfortune gets wind, the
<PB N="181" REF="180">
con&s;equence is that every dirty trade&s;man in town to whom I owe a &s;hilling, will be forming the &s;ame cur&s;ed combination tho&s;e &s;coundrels formed this morning, of coming in a body, and waiting for their money, or el&s;e bringing an execution into my hou&s;e. The only way to &s;ilence report is by putting a good face upon the matter at once, and &s;hewing our&s;elves to the world as if nothing had happened. Favour us, therefore, to|night with your company, which is really important to us, or ten to one, but in another fortnight, I &s;hall be ju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;crape."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, however incen&s;ed at this intel|ligence that his debts were &s;till &s;o numerous, felt now as much alarmed at the mention of an execution, as if &s;he was in actual danger of ruin her&s;elf. Terrified, therefore, though not convinced, &s;he yielded to their per|&s;ua&s;ions, and con&s;ented to accompany them.</P>
<P>They &s;oon after &s;eparated to make &s;ome alteration in their dre&s;s, and then, calling in their way for Mrs. Mears, they pro|ceeded to the Pantheon.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A MAN OF THE TON.</HEAD>
<P>AT the door of the Pantheon they were joined by Mr. Arnott and Sir Robert Floyer, whom Cecilia now &s;aw with added aver&s;ion: they entered the great room during the &s;econd act of the Concert, to which as no one of the party but her&s;elf had any de&s;ire to li&s;ten, no &s;ort of attention was paid; the ladies entertaining them&s;elves as if no Orche&s;tra was in the room, and the gentlemen, with an equal di&s;regard to it, &s;truggling for a place by the fire, about which they continued hovering till the mu|&s;ic was over.</P>
<P>Soon after they were &s;eated, Mr. Mea|dows, &s;auntering towards them, whi&s;pered &s;omething to Mrs. Mears, who, immediate|ly ri&s;ing, introduced him to Cecilia; after which, the place next to her being vacant, he ca&s;t him&s;elf upon it, and lolling as much at his ea&s;e as his &s;ituation would permit, be|gan &s;omething like a conver&s;ation with her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you been long in town, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is not your fir&s;t winter?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="182">
<Q REND="inline">"Of being in town, it is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then you have &s;omething new to &s;ee; O charming! how I envy you!&mdash;Are you plea&s;ed with the Pantheon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very much; I have &s;een no building at all equal to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have not been abroad. Travel|ling is the ruin of all happine&s;s! There's no looking at a building here after &s;eeing Italy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Does all happine&s;s, then, depend upon the &s;ight of buildings?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, when, turning towards her companion, &s;he per|ceived him yawning, with &s;uch evident in|attention to her an&s;wer, that not chu&s;ing to interrupt his reverie, &s;he turned her head another way.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes he took no notice of this; and then, as if &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he called out ha&s;tily <Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon, ma'am, you were &s;aying &s;ome|thing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, nothing worth repeating."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pray don't puni&s;h me &s;o &s;everely as not to let me hear it!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though merely not to &s;eem of|fended at his negligence, was then again beginning an an&s;wer, when, looking at him as &s;he &s;poke, &s;he perceived that he was bit|ing his nails with &s;o ab&s;ent an air, that he appeared not to know he had a&s;ked any
<PB N="184" REF="183">
que&s;tion. She therefore broke off, and left him to his cogitation.</P>
<P>Sometime after he addre&s;&s;ed her again, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Don't you find this place extreme|ly tire&s;ome, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, half laughing, <Q REND="inline">"it is, indeed, not very entertaining!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing is entertaining,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"for two minutes together. Things are &s;o little different one from another, that there is no making plea&s;ure out of any thing. We go the &s;ame dull round for ever; no|thing new, no variety! all the &s;ame thing over again! Are you fond of public places, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, <HI>&s;oberly,</HI> as Lady Grace &s;ays."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I envy you extremely, for you have &s;ome amu&s;ement always in your own power. How de&s;irable that is!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And have not you the &s;ame re&s;our|ces?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no! I am tired to death! tired of every thing! I would give the univer&s;e for a di&s;po&s;ition le&s;s difficult to plea&s;e. Yet, after all, what is there to give plea&s;ure? When one has &s;een one thing, one has &s;een every thing. O, 'tis heavy work! Don't you find it &s;o ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech was ended with &s;o violent a fit of yawning, that Cecilia would not trouble her&s;elf to an&s;wer it; but her &s;ilence,
<PB N="185" REF="184">
as before, pa&s;&s;ed wholly unnoticed, excit|ing neither que&s;tion nor comment.</P>
<P>A long pau&s;e now &s;ucceeded, which he broke at la&s;t, by &s;aying, as he writhed him&s;elf about upon his &s;eat, <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e forms would be much more agreeable if there were backs to them. 'Tis intolerable to be forced to &s;it like a &s;chool-boy. The fir&s;t &s;tudy of life is ea&s;e. There is, indeed, no other &s;tudy that pays the trouble of attain|ment.

<P><Q REND="inline">"But may not even that,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"by &s;o much &s;tudy, become labour?"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon, ma'am, but I thought you &s;aid&mdash;I really beg your par|don, but I was thinking of &s;omething el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You did very right, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"for what I &s;aid by no means merited any attention."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you do me the favour to repeat it?"</Q> cried he, taking out his gla&s;s to exa|mine &s;ome lady at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that would be trying your patience too &s;everely."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e gla&s;&s;es &s;hew one nothing but de|fects,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry they were ever invented. They are the ruin of all beauty; no complexion can &s;tand them. I

believe that &s;olo will never be over! I hate a &s;olo; it &s;inks, it depre&s;&s;es me intoler|ably."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will pre&s;ently, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|lia, looking at the bill of the concert, <Q REND="inline">"have a full piece; and that, I hope, will revive you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A full piece! oh in&s;upportable! it &s;tuns, it fatigues, it overpowers me beyond endurance! no ta&s;te in it, no delicacy, no room for the &s;malle&s;t feeling."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, then, you are only fond of &s;inging?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be, if I could hear it; but we are now &s;o mi&s;erably off in voices, that I hardly ever attempt to li&s;ten to a &s;ong, without fancying my&s;elf deaf from the feeblene&s;s of the performers. I hate every thing that requires attention. Nothing gives plea&s;ure that does not force its own way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You only, then, like loud voices, and great powers?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O wor&s;e and wor&s;e!&mdash;no, nothing is &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting to me. All my amazement is that the&s;e people think it worth while to give Concerts at all; one is &s;ick to death of mu&s;ic."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if it gives no plea&s;ure, at lea&s;t it takes none away; for, far from being any impediment to conver|&s;ation,

I think every body talks more du|ring the performance than between the acts. And what is there better you could &s;ub&s;ti|tute in its place?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, receiving no an&s;wer to this que&s;|tion, again looked round to &s;ee if &s;he had been heard; when &s;he ob&s;erved her new ac|quaintance, with a very thoughtful air, had turned from her to fix his eyes upon the &s;tatue of Britannia.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after, he ha&s;tily aro&s;e, and &s;eeming entirely to forget that he had &s;poke to her, very abruptly walked away.</P>
<P>Mr. Go&s;port, who was advancing to Ce|cilia, and had watched part of this &s;cene, &s;topt him as he was retreating, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Why Meadows, how's this? are you caught at la&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O worn to death! worn to a thread!"</Q> cried he, &s;tretching him&s;elf, and yawning; <Q REND="inline">"I have been talking with a young lady to entertain her! O &s;uch heavy work! I would not go through it again for millions!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, have you talked your&s;elf out of breath?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; but the effort! the effort!&mdash;O, it has unhinged me for a fortnight!&mdash;En|tertaining a young lady!&mdash;one had better be a galley-&s;lave at once!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well but, did &s;he not pay your toils? She is &s;urely a &s;weet creature."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="187">
<Q REND="inline">"Nothing can pay one for &s;uch in&s;uffer|able exertion! though &s;he's well enough, too,&mdash;better than the common run,&mdash;but &s;hy, quite too &s;hy; no drawing her out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought that was to your ta&s;te. You commonly hate much volubility. How have I heard you bemoan your&s;elf when at|tacked by Mi&s;s Larolles!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Larolles? O di&s;traction! She talks me into a fever in two minutes. But &s;o it is for ever! nothing but extremes to be met with! common girls are too forward, this lady is too re&s;erved&mdash;always &s;ome fault! always &s;ome drawback! nothing ever per|fect!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, nay,"</Q> cried Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"you do not know her; &s;he is perfect enough in all con&s;cience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Better not know her, then,"</Q> an&s;wered he, again yawning, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;he cannot be plea&s;ing. Nothing perfect is natural;&mdash;I hate every thing out of nature."</Q></P>
<P>He then &s;trolled on, and Mr. Go&s;port approached Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have been wi&s;hing,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"to addre&s;s you this half hour, but as you were engaged with Mr. Meadows, I did not dare advance."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, if you do not admire Mr. Mea|dows,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t not even whi&s;per it to the winds."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is he, then, &s;o very admirable?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, he is now in the very height of fa|&s;hionable favour: his dre&s;s is a model, his manners are imitated, his attention is court|ed, and his notice is envied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you not laughing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed; his privileges are much more exten&s;ive than I have mentioned: his deci&s;ion fixes the exact limits between what is vulgar and what is elegant, his prai&s;e gives reputation, and a word from him in public confers fa&s;hion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And by what wonderful powers has he acquired &s;uch influence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By nothing but a happy art in catch|ing the reigning foibles of the times, and carrying them to an extreme yet more ab|&s;urd than any one had done before him.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Very po&s;&s;ible, for qualities &s;uch as the&s;e con&s;titute the pre&s;ent ta&s;te of the times. A man of the <HI>Ton,</HI> who would now be con&s;picuous in the gay world, mu&s;t in|variably be in&s;ipid, negligent, and &s;elfi&s;h."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Admirable requi&s;ites!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"and Mr. Meadows, I acknowledge, &s;eems to have attained them all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t never,"</Q> continued Mr. Go&s;|port, <Q REND="inline">"confe&s;s the lea&s;t plea&s;ure from any thing, a total apathy being the chief ingre|dient of his character: he mu&s;t, upon no account, &s;u&s;tain a conver&s;ation with any &s;pirit, le&s;t he &s;hould appear, to his utter di&s;grace, intere&s;ted in what is &s;aid: and when he is quite tired of his exi&s;tence, from a total vacuity of ideas, he mu&s;t affect a look of ab&s;ence, and pretend, on the &s;ud|den, to be wholly lo&s;t in thought."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would not wi&s;h,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, laugh|ing, <Q REND="inline">"a more amiable companion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If he is a&s;ked his opinion of any lady,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"he mu&s;t commonly an&s;wer by a grimace; and if he is &s;eated next to one, he mu&s;t take the utmo&s;t pains to &s;hew
<PB N="191" REF="190">
by his li&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, yawning and inattention, that he is &s;ick of his &s;ituation; for what he holds of all things to be mo&s;t gothic, is gal|lantry to the women. To avoid this is, indeed, the principal &s;olicitude of his life. If he &s;ees a lady in di&s;tre&s;s for her carriage, he is to enquire of her what is the matter, and then, with a &s;hrug, wi&s;h her well through her fatigues, wink at &s;ome bye|&s;tander, and walk away. If he is in a room where there is a crowd of company, and a &s;carcity of &s;eats, he mu&s;t early en&s;ure one of the be&s;t in the place, be blind to all looks of fatigue, and deaf to all hints of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and &s;eeming totally to forget him&s;elf, lounge at his ea&s;e, and appear an uncon|&s;cious &s;pectator of what is going forward. If he is at a ball where there are more wo|men than men, he mu&s;t decline dancing at all, though it &s;hould happen to be his fa|vourite amu&s;ement, and &s;miling as he pa&s;&s;es the di&s;engaged young ladies, wonder to &s;ee them &s;it &s;till, and perhaps a&s;k them the rea&s;on!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A mo&s;t alluring character indeed!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"and pray how long have the&s;e been the accompli&s;hments of a fine gentleman?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am but an indifferent chronologer of the modes,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"but I know it has been long enough to rai&s;e ju&s;t expecta|tions
<PB N="192" REF="191">
that &s;ome new folly will be &s;tarted &s;oon, by which the pre&s;ent race of INSEN|SIBLISTS may be driven out. Mr. Mea|dows is now at the head of this &s;ect, as Mi&s;s Larolles is of the VOLUBLE, and Mi&s;s Lee&s;on of the SUPERCILIOUS. But this way comes another, who, though in a different manner, labours with the &s;ame view, and a&s;pires at the &s;ame reward; which &s;timulate the ambition of this happy <HI>Trip|let,</HI> that of exciting wonder by peculiarity, and envy by wonder.</Q></P>
<P>This de&s;cription announced Capt. Are&s;|by; who, advancing from the fire-place, told Cecilia how much he rejoiced in &s;eeing her, &s;aid he had been <HI>reduced to de&s;pair</HI> by &s;o long mi&s;&s;ing that honour, and that he had feared &s;he <HI>made it a principle</HI> to avoid com|ing in public, having &s;ought her in vain <HI>partout.</HI></P>
<P>He then &s;miled, and &s;trolled on to ano|ther party.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray of what &s;ect,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is this gentleman?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of the &s;ect of JARGONISTS,"</Q> an|&s;wered Mr. Go&s;port; he has not an ambi|tion beyond paying a pa&s;&s;ing compliment, nor a word to make u&s;e of that he has not picked up at public places. Yet this dearth of language, however you may de&s;pi&s;e it, is not merely owing to a narrow capacity:
<PB N="193" REF="192">
foppery and conceit have their &s;hare in the limitation, for though his phra&s;es are al|mo&s;t always ridiculous or mi&s;applied, they are &s;elected with much &s;tudy, and intro|duced with infinite pains."</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor man!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;|&s;ible it can co&s;t him any trouble to render him&s;elf &s;o completely ab&s;urd?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes; but not more than it co&s;ts his neighbours to keep him in countenance. Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, &s;ince &s;he has pre&s;ided over the &s;ect of the SUPERCILIOUS, &s;pends at lea&s;t half her life in wi&s;hing the annihila|tion of the other half; for as &s;he mu&s;t only &s;peak in her own Coterie, &s;he is compelled to be frequently &s;ilent, and therefore, hav|ing nothing to think of, &s;he is commonly gnawn with &s;elf-denial, and &s;oured with want of amu&s;ement: Mi&s;s Larolles, in|deed, is better off, for in talking fa&s;ter than &s;he thinks, &s;he has but followed the natural bent of her di&s;po&s;ition: as to this poor JARGONIST, he has, I mu&s;t own, rather a hard ta&s;k, from the continual re|&s;traint of &s;peaking only out of his own Lili|putian vocabulary, and denying him&s;elf the relief of ever uttering one word by the call of occa&s;ion: but what hard&s;hip is that, compared with what is borne by Mr. Mea|dows? who, &s;ince he commenced INSEN|SIBLIST, has never once dared to be
<PB N="194" REF="193">
plea&s;ed, nor ventured for a moment to look in good humour!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"in a &s;hort time, the puni&s;hment of this affectation will bring its cure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; for the trick grows into habit, and habit is a &s;econd nature. A &s;ecret idea of fame makes his forbearance of happine&s;s &s;upportable to him: for he has now the &s;elf-&s;atisfaction of con&s;idering him&s;elf rai&s;|ed to that highe&s;t pinnacle of fa&s;hionable refinement which is built upon apathy and &s;corn, and from which, proclaiming him|&s;elf &s;uperior to all po&s;&s;ibility of enjoyment, he views the whole world with contempt! holding neither beauty, virtue, wealth nor power of importance &s;ufficient to kindle the &s;malle&s;t emotion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O that they could all round li&s;ten to you!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"they would &s;oon, I think, &s;icken of their folly, if they heard it thus admirably expo&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; they would but triumph that it had obtained them &s;o much notice!&mdash;But pray do you &s;ee that gentleman, or don't you chu&s;e to know him, who has been bowing to you this half hour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where?"</Q> cried Cecilia, and, looking round, perceived Mr. Morrice; who, upon her returning his &s;alutation, in&s;tantly ap|proached her, though he had never ventur|ed
<PB N="195" REF="194">
to &s;hew him&s;elf at Mr. Harrel's, &s;ince his unfortunate accident on the evening of the ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>Entirely ca&s;ting a&s;ide the ea&s;y familiarity at which he had latterly arrived, he en|quired after her health with the mo&s;t fear|ful diffidence, and then, bowing profound|ly, was mode&s;tly retiring; when Mrs. Har|rel, perceiving him, &s;miled with &s;o much good-humour, that he gathered courage to return and addre&s;s her, and found her, to his infinite delight, as obliging and civil as ever.</P>
<P>The Concert was now over; the ladies aro&s;e, and the gentlemen joined them. Morrice, at &s;ight of Mr. Harrel, was again &s;hrinking; but Mr. Harrel, immediately &s;haking hands with him, enquired what had kept him &s;o long from Portman-Square? Morrice then, finding, to his great &s;ur|pri&s;e, that no one had thought more of the mi&s;chief but him&s;elf who had committed it, joyou&s;ly di&s;carded his timidity, and became as &s;prightly as before his mortification.</P>
<P>A motion was now made for going to the tea-room; and as they walked on, Cecilia, in looking up to examine the building, &s;aw in one of the galleries young Delvile, and almo&s;t at the &s;ame time caught his eye.</P>
<P>Scarcely now did a moment elap&s;e before he joined her. The &s;ight of him, &s;trongly
<PB N="196" REF="195">
reviving in her mind the painful contrarie|ty of opinion with which &s;he had lately thought of him, the &s;entiments &s;o much in his favour which but a few days before &s;he had encouraged, and which it was only that morning &s;he had endeavoured to cru&s;h, made her meet him with a kind of melan|choly that almo&s;t induced her to lament he was amiable, and repine that &s;he knew none like him.</P>
<P>His appearance, mean time, was far dif|ferent; he &s;eemed enchanted at the &s;ight of her, he flew eagerly to meet her, and his eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure as he approach|ed her; a plea&s;ure neither moderate nor di&s;|gui&s;ed, but lively, unre&s;trained, and ex|pre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who&s;e plans &s;ince &s;he had la&s;t &s;een him had twice varied, who fir&s;t had looked forward to being united with him for ever, and afterwards had determined to avoid with him even a common acquain|tance, could not, while the&s;e thoughts were all recurring to her memory, receive much delight from ob&s;erving his gaiety, or feel at all gratified by his unembarra&s;&s;ed manners. The openne&s;s of his attentions, and the frankne&s;s of his admiration, which hitherto had charmed her as marks of the &s;incerity of his character, now &s;hocked her as proofs of the indifference of his heart, which feel|ing
<PB N="197" REF="196">
for her a mere common regard, that af|fected neither his &s;pirits nor his peace, he manife&s;ted without &s;cruple, &s;ince it was not accompanied with even a wi&s;h beyond the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>She now, too, recollected that &s;uch had always been his conduct, one &s;ingle and &s;ingular moment excepted, when, as he gave to her his letter for Mr. Belfield, he &s;eemed &s;truck as &s;he was her&s;elf by the extraordi|nary co-incidence of their ideas and pro|ceedings: that emotion, however, &s;he now regarded as ca&s;ual and tran&s;itory, and &s;ee|ing him &s;o much happier than her&s;elf, &s;he felt a&s;hamed of her delu&s;ion, and angry at her ea&s;y captivation.</P>
<P>Reflections &s;uch as the&s;e, though they added fre&s;h motives to her re&s;olution of giving up all thoughts of his alliance, were yet &s;o humiliating, that they robbed her of all power of receiving plea&s;ure from what was pa&s;&s;ing, and made her forget that the place &s;he was in was even intended for a place of entertainment.</P>
<P>Young Delvile, after painting in lively colours the lo&s;s his hou&s;e had &s;u&s;tained by her quitting it, and dwelling with equal force upon the regret of his mother and his own, a&s;ked in a low voice if &s;he would do him &s;o much honour as to introduce him to Mr. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"As the &s;on,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">of
<PB N="198" REF="197">
a brother guardian, I think I have a kind of claim to his acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia could not refu&s;e, though as the reque&s;t was likely to occa&s;ion more frequent meetings, &s;he per&s;uaded her&s;elf &s;he was un|willing to comply. The ceremony there|fore pa&s;t, and was again repeated with Mrs. Harrel, who, though &s;he had &s;everal times &s;een him, had never been formally made known to him.</P>
<P>The Harrels were both of them much plea&s;ed at this mark of civility in a young man who&s;e family had prepared them rather to expect his &s;corn, and expre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;hes that he would drink his tea in their party; he accepted their invitation with alacrity, and turning to Cecilia, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Have I not &s;kilfully timed my introduction? But though you have done me this honour with Mr. and Mrs. Harrel, I mu&s;t not yet, I pre&s;ume, entreat you to extend it to a cer|tain happy gentleman of this company;"</Q> glancing his eyes towards Sir Robert Floyer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with quick|ne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"yet, nor ever!"</Q></P>
<P>They were now at the door leading down &s;tairs to the tea-room. Cecilia &s;aw that Sir Robert, who had hitherto been engaged with &s;ome gentlemen, &s;eemed to be &s;eeking her; and the remembrance of the quarrel which
<PB N="199" REF="198">
had followed her refu&s;al of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the Opera-hou&s;e, obliged her to determine, &s;hould he offer it again, to accept it: but the &s;ame brutality which forced this inten|tion, contributed to render it repugnant to her, and &s;he re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to avoid him, by hurrying down &s;tairs before he reached her. She made, therefore, a &s;ud|den attempt to &s;lip through the crowd, and as &s;he was light and active, &s;he ea&s;ily &s;uc|ceeded; but though her ha&s;ty motion &s;epa|rated her from the re&s;t of her party, Del|vile, who was earne&s;tly looking at her, to di&s;cover her meaning in the di&s;claiming &s;peech &s;he made about Sir Robert, &s;aw into her de&s;ign, but &s;uffered her not to go alone; he contrived in a moment to follow and join her, while &s;he was &s;topping at the foot of the &s;tairs for Mrs. Harrel.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what a little thief you are,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"to run away from us thus! what do you think Sir Robert will &s;ay? I &s;aw him looking for you at the very in&s;tant of your flight."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then you &s;aw at the &s;ame time,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the rea&s;on of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you give me leave,"</Q> cried he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"to repeat this to my Lord Er|nolf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may repeat it, Sir, if you plea&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, piqued that he had not ra|ther
<PB N="200" REF="199">
thought of him&s;elf than of Lord Er|nolf, <Q REND="inline">"to the whole Pantheon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And if I &s;hould,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"half of it, at lea&s;t, would thank me; and to ob|tain the applau&s;e of &s;o noble an a&s;&s;embly, what would it &s;ignify that Sir Robert &s;hould cut my throat?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, deeply mortifi|ed by a raillery that &s;hewed &s;o little intere&s;t in her avowal of indifference, <Q REND="inline">"you are determined to make me as &s;ick of that man's name, as I am of his conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is it po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> exclaimed Delvile, in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;uch can be your opinion, and yet, &s;ituated as you are, the whole world at your command, and all mankind at your devotion&mdash;but I am an|&s;wering you &s;eriou&s;ly, when you are only &s;peaking by rule."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What rule, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That which young ladies, upon cer|tain occa&s;ions, always pre&s;cribe them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>Here they were interrupted by the arrival of the re&s;t of the company; though not be|fore Cecilia had received &s;ome little con&s;o|lation for her di&s;plea&s;ure, by finding that young Delvile &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was engag|ed, and flattering her&s;elf his language would be different were he informed of the con|trary.</P>
<P>Morrice now undertook to procure them
<PB N="201" REF="200">
a table for tea, which, as the room was very full, was not ea&s;ily done; and while they were waiting his &s;ucce&s;s, Mi&s;s Larolles, who from the &s;tairs had perceived Cecilia, came running up to her, and taking her hand, called out <Q REND="inline">"Lord, my dear creature, who'd have thought of &s;eeing you here? I was never &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed in my life! I really thought you was gone into a convent, it's &s;o extreme long &s;ince I've &s;een you. But of all things in the world, why was you not at Lady Nyland's la&s;t a&s;&s;embly? I thought of a&s;king Mrs. Harrel fifty times why you did not come, but it always went out of my head. You've no notion how exce&s;&s;ive|ly I was di&s;appointed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very obliging,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia laughing, <Q REND="inline">"but I hope, &s;ince you &s;o often forgot it, the di&s;appointment did much le&s;|&s;en your entertainment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord no! I was never &s;o happy in my life. There was &s;uch a crowd, you could not move a finger. Every body in the world was there. You've no idea how delightful it was. I thought verily I &s;hould have fainted with the heat."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That was delightful indeed! And how long did you &s;tay?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why we danced till three in the morn|ing. We began with Cotillons, and fini&s;h|ed with country dances. It was the mo&s;t
<PB N="202" REF="201">
elegant thing you ever &s;aw in your life; every thing quite in a &s;tyle. I was &s;o mon|&s;trou&s;ly fatigued, I could hardly get through the la&s;t dance. I really thought I &s;hould have dropt down dead. Only conceive danc|ing five hours in &s;uch a mon&s;trous crowd! I a&s;&s;ure you when I got home my feet were all bli&s;ters. You have no idea how they &s;marted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And whence comes it,"</Q> cried young Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>you</HI> partake &s;o little of the&s;e delights?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I fear,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">I came too late into the &s;chool of fa&s;hion to be a ductile pupil."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you know,"</Q> continued Mi&s;s La|rolles, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Meadows has not &s;poke one word to me all the evening! Though I am &s;ure he &s;aw me, for I &s;at at the out&s;ide on purpo&s;e to &s;peak to a per&s;on or two, that I knew would be &s;trolling about; for if one &s;its on the in&s;ide, there's no &s;peaking to a creature, you know, &s;o I never do it at the Opera, nor in the boxes at Ranelagh, nor any where. It's the &s;hockinge&s;t thing you can conceive to be made &s;it in the middle of tho&s;e forms; one might as well be at home, for nobody can &s;peak to one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you don't &s;eem to have had much better &s;ucce&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"in keeping at the out&s;ide."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="202">
<Q REND="inline">"O yes I have, for I got a little chat with two or three people as they were pa&s;|&s;ing, for, you know, when one &s;its there, they can't help &s;aying &s;omething; though I a&s;&s;ure you all the men are &s;o exce&s;&s;ively odd they don't care whether they &s;peak to one or no. As to Mr. Meadows, he's really enough to provoke one to death. I &s;up|po&s;e he's in one of his ab&s;ent fits. How|ever, I a&s;&s;ure you I think it's extreme im|pertinent of him, and &s;o I &s;hall tell Mr. Sawyer, for I know he'll make a point of telling him of it again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I rather think,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the be&s;t would be to return the compliment in kind, and when he next recollects you, ap|pear to have forgotten him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord, that's a very good notion! &s;o I will, I edclare. But you can't conceive how glad I am the Concert's over; for I a&s;&s;ure you, though I &s;at as near the fire as po&s;&s;ible, I was &s;o extreme cold you've no idea, for Mr. Meadows never would let me have the lea&s;t peep at it. I declare I believe he does it on purpo&s;e to plague one, for he grows wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day. You can't think how I hate him!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not ea&s;ily, I believe indeed!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, archly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O do but look!"</Q> re&s;umed the fair VOLUBLE, <Q REND="inline">"if there is not Mrs. Mears
<PB N="204" REF="203">
in her old red gown again! I begin to think &s;he'll never have another. I wi&s;h &s;he was to have an execution in her hou&s;e, if it was only to get rid of it! I am &s;o fatigued with the &s;ight of it you can't conceive."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Morrice now brought intelligence that he had &s;ecured one &s;ide of a table which would very well accommodate the ladies; and that the other &s;ide was only oc|cupied by one gentleman, who, as he was not drinking tea him&s;elf, would doubtle&s;s give up his place when the party appeared.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles then ran back to her own &s;et, and the re&s;t followed Mr. Morrice: Mrs. Harrel, Mrs. Mears and Cecilia took their places. The gentleman oppo&s;ite to them proved to be Mr. Meadows: Mor|rice, therefore, was much deceived in his expectations, for, far from giving up his place, he had flung him&s;elf all along upon the form in &s;uch a lounging po&s;ture, while he re&s;ted one arm upon the table, that, not contented with merely keeping his own &s;eat, he filled up a &s;pace meant for three.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel had already walked off to another party: Delvile &s;tood aloof for &s;ome minutes, expecting Sir Robert Floyer would &s;tation him&s;elf behind Cecilia; but Sir Ro|bert, who would &s;carce have thought &s;uch a conde&s;cen&s;ion due to a prince&s;s, di&s;dained any appearance of a&s;&s;iduity, even while he
<PB N="205" REF="204">
made it his care to publi&s;h his preten&s;ions: and therefore, finding no accommodation to plea&s;e him, he &s;talked towards &s;ome gentle|men in another part of the room. Delvile then took the po&s;t he had neglected, and Mr. Arnott, who had not had courage to make any effort in his own favour, mode&s;t|ly &s;tood near him. Cecilia contrived to make room for Mr. Go&s;port next to her&s;elf, and Morrice was &s;ufficiently happy in being allowed to call the waiters, &s;uperintend the provi&s;ions, and &s;erve the whole party.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k of making tea fell upon Ceci|lia, who being &s;omewhat incommoded by the vicinity of her neighbours, Mrs. Mears called out to Mr. Meadows <Q REND="inline">"Do pray, Sir, be &s;o good as to make room for one of us at your &s;ide."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, who was indolently pick|ing his teeth, and examining them with a tooth pick ca&s;e gla&s;s, did not, at fir&s;t, &s;eem to hear her; and when &s;he repeated her reque&s;t, he only looked at her, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"umph?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now really, Mr. Meadows,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"when you &s;ee any ladies in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, I wonder how you can forbear helping them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In di&s;tre&s;s, are you?"</Q> cried he, with a vacant &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"pray what's the matter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't you &s;ee? we are &s;o crowded we can hardly &s;it."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"Can't you?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"upon my ho|nour it's very &s;hameful that the&s;e people don't contrive &s;ome &s;eats more convenient."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mears; <Q REND="inline">"but if you would be &s;o kind as to let &s;omebody el&s;e &s;it by you we &s;hould not want any contrivance."</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Meadows was &s;eized with a furious fit of yawning, which as much di|verted Cecilia and Mr. Go&s;port, as it of|fended Mrs. Mears, who with great di&s;|plea&s;ure added, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Mr. Meadows, it's very &s;trange that you never hear what's &s;aid to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"were you &s;peaking to me?"</Q> and again began picking his teeth.</P>
<P>Morrice, eager to contra&s;t his civility with the inattention of Mr. Meadows, now flew round to the other &s;ide of the table, and calling out <Q REND="inline">"let <HI>me</HI> help you, Mi&s;s Bever|ley, I can make tea better than any body,"</Q> he lent over that part of the form which Mr. Meadows had occupied with one of his feet, in order to pour it out him&s;elf: but Mr. Meadows, by an unfortunate removal of his foot, bringing him forwarder than he was prepared to go, the tea pot and its con|tents were overturned immediately oppo&s;ite to Cecilia.</P>
<P>Young Delvile, who &s;aw the impending evil, from an impetuous impul&s;e to prevent her &s;uffering by it, ha&s;tily drew her back,
<PB N="207" REF="206">
and bending down before her, &s;ecured her pre&s;ervation by receiving him&s;elf the mi&s;|chief with which &s;he was threatened.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mears and Mrs. Harrel vacated their &s;eats in a moment, and Mr. Go&s;port and Mr. Arnott a&s;&s;i&s;ted in clearing the ta|ble, and removing Cecilia, who was very &s;lightly hurt, and at once &s;urpri&s;ed, a&s;hamed and plea&s;ed at the manner in which &s;he had been &s;aved.</P>
<P>Young Delvile, though a &s;ufferer from his gallantry, the hot water having pene|trated through his coat to his arm and &s;houlder, was at fir&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to his &s;itua|tion, from an apprehen&s;ion that Cecilia had not wholly e&s;caped; and his enquiries were &s;o eager and &s;o anxious, made with a look of &s;uch &s;olicitude, and a voice of &s;uch alarm, that, equally a&s;toni&s;hed and gra|tified, &s;he &s;ecretly ble&s;t the accident which had given birth to his unea&s;ine&s;s, however &s;he grieved for its con&s;equence to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was he &s;atisfied of her &s;afety, than he felt him&s;elf obliged to retire; yet attributing to inconvenience what was really the effect of pain, he hurried away with an appearance of &s;port, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"There is &s;omething, I mu&s;t own, rather <HI>unknightly</HI> in quitting the field for a wet jacket, but the company, I hope, will only give me credit for flying away to Ranelagh.

<L>" Like a brave general after being beat,</L>
<L>I'll exult and rejoice in a prudent retreat."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smart.</NOTE></L></Q></Q></P>
<P>He then ha&s;tened to his carriage: and poor Morrice, frightened and confounded at the di&s;a&s;ter he had occa&s;ioned, &s;neaked after him, with much le&s;s ceremony. While Mr. Meadows, wholly unconcerned by the di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion around him, &s;at qui|etly picking his teeth, and looking on, during the whole tran&s;action, with an un|meaning &s;tare, that made it doubtful whe|ther he had even perceived it.</P>
<P>Order being now &s;oon re&s;tored, the ladies fini&s;hed their tea, and went up &s;tairs. Ce|cilia, to whom the late accident had afforded much new and intere&s;ting matter for re|flection, wi&s;hed immediately to have re|turned home, but &s;he was not the leader of the party, and therefore could not make the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>They then &s;trolled through all the apart|ments, and having walked about till the fa&s;hionable time of retiring, they were joined by Sir Robert Floyer, and proceeded to the little room near the entrance to the great one, in order to wait for their car|riages.</P>
<P>Here Cecilia again met Mi&s;s Larolles, who came to make various remarks, and
<PB N="209" REF="208">
infinite ridicule, upon &s;undry unfa&s;hionable or unco&s;tly articles in the dre&s;&s;es of the &s;ur|rounding company; as well as to complain, with no little re&s;entment, that Mr. Mea|dows was again &s;tanding before the fire!</P>
<P>Captain Are&s;by al&s;o advanced, to tell her he was quite <HI>abattu</HI> by having &s;o long lo&s;t &s;ight of her, to hope &s;he <HI>would make a renounce</HI> of mortifying the world by di&s;|carding it, and to prote&s;t he had waited for his carriage till he was actually upon the point of being <HI>acabl&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this <HI>jargon,</HI> to which the fulne&s;s of Cecilia's mind hardly permitted her to li&s;ten, there &s;uddenly appeared at the door of the apartment, Mr. Albany, who, with his u&s;ual au&s;terity of countenance, &s;topt to look round upon the company.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you &s;ee,"</Q> cried Mr. Go&s;port to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"who approaches? your poor <HI>&s;ycophants</HI> will again be taken to ta&s;k, and I, for one, tremble at the coming &s;torm!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h I was &s;afe in my chair! that man always frightens me out of my &s;en&s;es.

<P><PB N="210" REF="209">
<Q REND="inline">"It is really a petrifying thing,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"that one can go to no <HI>&s;pectacle</HI> without the <HI>horreur</HI> of being <HI>ob&s;ed&eacute;</HI> by that per&s;on! if he comes this way, I &s;hall certainly make a renounce, and re|tire."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o?"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"what the d&mdash;l do you mind him for?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O he is the greate&s;t bore in nature!"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"and I always do <HI>mon po&s;&s;ible</HI> to avoid him; for he breaks out into &s;uch barbarous phra&s;es, that I find my&s;elf <HI>degout&eacute;</HI> with him in a moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"he attacks one &s;ometimes in a manner you've no idea. One day he came up to me all of a &s;udden, and a&s;ked me what good I thought I did by dre&s;&s;ing &s;o much? Only conceive how &s;hocking!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I have had the <HI>horreur</HI> of que&s;tions of that &s;ort from him <HI>&s;ans fin,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"once he took the liberty to a&s;k me, what &s;ervice I was of to the world! and another time, he de&s;ired me to inform him whether I had ever made any poor per&s;on pray for me! and, in &s;hort, he has &s;o fre|quently inconvenienced me by his imper|tinences, that he really bores me to a de|gree."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's ju&s;t the thing that makes him hunt you down,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert; <Q REND="inline">"if he
<PB N="211" REF="210">
were to a&s;k me que&s;tions for a month toge|ther, I &s;hould never trouble my&s;elf to move a mu&s;cle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The matter of his di&s;cour&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"is not more &s;ingular than the manner, for without any &s;eeming effort or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, he runs into blank ver&s;e per|petually. I have made much enquiry about him, but all I am able to learn, is that he was certainly confined, at one part of his life, in a private mad-hour&s;e: and though now, from not being mi&s;chievous, he is &s;et at liberty, his looks, language, and whole behaviour, announce the former injury of his intellects."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, half|&s;creaming, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hocking notions you put in one's head! I declare I dare &s;ay I &s;ha'n't get &s;afe home for him, for I a&s;&s;ure you I believe he's taken a &s;pite to me! and all becau&s;e one day, before I knew of his odd ways, I happened to fall a laughing at his going about in that old coat. Do you know it put him quite in a pa&s;&s;ion! only conceive how ill-natured!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O he has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me,"</Q> exclaimed the Captain, with a &s;hrug, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>partout!</HI> and found &s;o much fault with every thing I have done, that I &s;hould really be glad to have the honour to cut, for the moment he comes up to me, I know what I have to expect!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="211">
<Q REND="inline">"But I mu&s;t tell you,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s La|rolles, <Q REND="inline">"how mon&s;trou&s;ly he put me in a fright one evening when I was talking with Mi&s;s Moffat.

I a&s;&s;ure you he cut me up &s;o you've no notion."</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Albany advanced; and every body but Sir Robert moved out of the way.</P>
<P>Fixing his eyes upon Cecilia, with an expre&s;&s;ion <HI>more in &s;orrow than in anger,</HI> after contemplating her &s;ome time in &s;ilence, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Ah lovely, but peri&s;hable flower! how long will that ingenuous coun|tenance, wearing, becau&s;e wanting no di&s;|gui&s;e, look re&s;pon&s;ive of the whitene&s;s of the region within? How long will that air of innocence irradiate your whole appear|ance? un&s;poilt by pro&s;perity, unperverted by power! pure in the mid&s;t of &s;urrounding depravity! un&s;ullied in the tainted air of infectious perdition!"</Q></P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of Cecilia at this public
<PB N="213" REF="212">
addre&s;s, which drew upon her the eyes and attention of all the company, was inex|pre&s;&s;ible; &s;he aro&s;e from her &s;eat, covered with blu&s;hes, and &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I fancy the carriage mu&s;t be ready,"</Q> pre&s;&s;ed forward to quit the room, followed by Sir Robert, who an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No, no, they'll call it when it comes up. Arnott, will you go and &s;ee where it is?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;topt, but whi&s;pered Mrs. Harrel to &s;tand near her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And whither,"</Q> cried Albany indig|nantly, <Q REND="inline">"whither would&s;t thou go? Art thou already di&s;dainful of my precepts? and can&s;t thou not one &s;hort moment &s;pare from the tumultuous folly which encircles thee? Many and many are the hours thou may&s;t &s;pend with &s;uch as the&s;e; the world, alas! is full of them; weary not then, &s;o &s;oon, of an old man that would admoni&s;h thee,&mdash;he cannot call upon thee long, for &s;oon he will be called upon him&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>This &s;olemn exhortation extremely di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed her; and fearing to &s;till further of|fend him by making another effort to e&s;cape, &s;he an&s;wered in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"I will not only hear, but thank you for your pre|cepts, if you will forbear to give them be|fore &s;o many witne&s;&s;es."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whence,"</Q> cried he &s;ternly, <Q REND="inline">"the&s;e vain and &s;uperficial di&s;tinctions? Do you
<PB N="214" REF="213">
not dance in public? What renders you more con&s;picuous? Do you not dre&s;s to be admired, and walk to be ob&s;erved? Why then this fanta&s;tical &s;cruple, unju&s;tified by rea&s;on, un&s;upported by analogy? Is folly only to be publi&s;hed? Is vanity alone to be exhibited? Oh &s;laves of &s;en&s;ele&s;s contradic|tion! Oh feeble followers of yet feebler preju|dice! daring to be wicked, yet fearing to be wi&s;e; dauntle&s;s in levity, yet &s;hrinking from the name of virtue!"</Q></P>
<P>The latter part of this &s;peech, during which he turned with energy to the whole company, rai&s;ed &s;uch a general alarm, that all the ladies ha&s;tily quitted the room, and all the gentlemen endeavoured to enter it, equally curious to &s;ee the man who made the oration, and the lady to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. Cecilia, therefore, found her &s;ituation un&s;upportable; <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t go,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"whether there is a carriage or not! pray, Mrs. Harrel, let us go!"</Q></P>
<P>Sir Robert then offered to take her hand, which &s;he was extremely ready to give him; but while the crowd made their pa&s;&s;age diffi|cult, Albany, following and &s;topping her, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What is it you fear? a mi&s;erable old man, worn out by the &s;orrows of that experience from which he offers you coun|&s;el? What, too, is it you tru&s;t? a libertine wretch, coveting nothing but your wealth,
<PB N="215" REF="214">
for the gift of which he will repay you by the perver&s;ion of your principles!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What the d&mdash;l do you mean by that?"</Q> cried the Baronet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To &s;hew,"</Q> an&s;wered he, au&s;terely, <Q REND="inline">"the incon&s;i&s;tency of fal&s;e delicacy; to &s;hew how tho&s;e who are too timid for truth, can fearle&s;s meet licentiou&s;ne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ay no more to me now! call upon me in Portman-&s;quare when you plea&s;e,&mdash;re|prove me in whatever you think me blame|able, I &s;hall be grateful for your in&s;tructions, and bettered, perhaps, by your care;&mdash;but le&s;&s;ons and notice thus public can do me nothing but injury."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How happy,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"were no other injury near thee! &s;potle&s;s were then the hour of thy danger, bright, fair and refulgent thy pa&s;&s;age to &s;ecurity! the Good would receive thee with prai&s;e, the Guilty would &s;upplicate thy prayers, the Poor would follow thee with ble&s;&s;ings, and Chil|dren would be taught by thy example!"</Q></P>
<P>He then quitted her, every body making way as he moved, and proceeded into the great room. Mrs. Harrel's carriage being al&s;o announced at the &s;ame time, Cecilia lo&s;t not an in&s;tant in ha&s;tening away.</P>
<P>Sir Robert, as he conducted her, di&s;|dainfully laughed at the adventure, which
<PB N="216" REF="215">
the general licence allowed to Mr. Albany prevented his re&s;enting, and which therefore he &s;corned to appear moved at.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel could talk of nothing el&s;e, neither was Cecilia di&s;po&s;ed to change the &s;ubject, for the remains of in&s;anity which &s;eemed to hang upon him were affecting without being alarming, and her de&s;ire to know more of him grew every in&s;tant &s;tronger.</P>
<P>This de&s;ire, however, outlived not the conver&s;ation to which it gave ri&s;e; when &s;he returned to her own room, no ve&s;tige of it remained upon her mind, which a nearer concern and deeper intere&s;t wholly occupied.</P>
<P>The behaviour of young Delvile had pained, plea&s;ed, and di&s;turbed her; his activity to &s;ave her from mi&s;chief might proceed merely from gallantry or good nature; upon that, therefore, &s;he dwelt little: but his eagerne&s;s, his anxiety, his in&s;en&s;ibility to him&s;elf, were more than good breeding could claim, and &s;eemed to &s;pring from a motive le&s;s artificial.</P>
<P>She now, therefore, believed that her partiality was returned; and this belief had power to &s;hake all her re&s;olves, and enfeeble all her objections. The arrogance of Mr. Delvile le&s;&s;ened in her reflections, the admo|nitions of Mr. Monckton abated in their influence. With the fir&s;t &s;he con&s;idered
<PB N="217" REF="216">
that though connected &s;he need not live, and for the &s;econd, though &s;he acknow|ledged the excellence of his judgment, &s;he concluded him wholly ignorant of her &s;en|timents of Delvile; which &s;he imagined, when once revealed, would make every ob|&s;tacle to the alliance &s;eem trifling, when put in competition with mutual e&s;teem and affection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A REPROOF.</HEAD>
<P>THE attention of Cecilia to her own affairs, did not make her forgetful of tho&s;e of the Harrels: and the morning after the bu&s;y day which was la&s;t recorded, as &s;oon as &s;he quitted the breakfa&s;t-room, &s;he began a note to Mr. Monckton, but was interrupted with information that he was al|ready in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She went to him immediately, and had the &s;atisfaction of finding him alone: but de&s;irous as &s;he was to relate to him the tran&s;actions of the preceding day, there was in his countenance a gravity &s;o unu&s;ual, that her impatience was involuntarily check|ed, and &s;he waited fir&s;t to hear if he had him&s;elf any thing to communicate.</P>
<P>He kept her not long in &s;u&s;pence; <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I bring you intelli|gence which though I know you will be very &s;orry to hear, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be told you immediately: you may otherwi&s;e, from however laudable motives, be drawn into &s;ome action which you may repent for life."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="218">
<Q REND="inline">"What now!"</Q> cried Cecilia, much alarmed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All that I &s;u&s;pected,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and more than I hinted to you, is true; Mr. Harrel is a ruined man! he is not worth a groat, and he is in debt beyond what he ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia made no an&s;wer: &s;he knew but too fatally the de&s;perate &s;tate of his affairs, yet that <HI>his debts were more than he had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;he had not thought po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My enquiries,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"have been among principals, and &s;uch as would not dare deceive me. I ha&s;tened, therefore, to you, that this timely notice might enforce the injunctions I gave you when I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you la&s;t, and prevent a misjudging genero&s;ity from leading you into any injury of your own fortune, for a man who is pa&s;t all relief from it, and who cannot be &s;aved, even though you were to be de&s;troyed for his &s;ake."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but your coun&s;el is now too late!"</Q> She then briefly acquainted him with what pa&s;&s;ed, and with how large a &s;um &s;he had parted.</P>
<P>He heard her with rage, amazement, and horror: and after inveighing again&s;t Mr. Harrel in the bittere&s;t terms, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"But why, before you &s;igned your name to &s;o
<PB N="220" REF="219">
ba&s;e an impo&s;ition, could you not &s;end for me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;hed, I meant to have done it,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but I thought the time pa&s;t when you could help me: how, indeed, could you have &s;aved me? my word was given, given with an oath the mo&s;t &s;olemn, and the fir&s;t I have ever taken in my life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An oath &s;o forced,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"the mo&s;t delicate con&s;cience would have ab&s;olved you from performing. You have, indeed, been gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon, and pardon me if I add unaccountably to blame. Was it not obvious that relief &s;o circum|&s;tanced mu&s;t be temporary? If his ruin had been any thing le&s;s than certain, what trade&s;men would have been in&s;olent? You have therefore deprived your&s;elf of the power of doing good to a worthier object, merely to grant a longer date to extrava|gance and villainy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet how,"</Q> cried Cecilia, deeply touched by this reproof, <Q REND="inline">"how could I do otherwi&s;e? Could I &s;ee a man in the agonies of de&s;pair, hear him fir&s;t darkly hint his own de&s;truction, and afterwards behold him almo&s;t in the very act of &s;uicide, the in&s;trument of &s;elf-murder in his de&s;perate hand&mdash;and yet, though he put his life in my power, though he told me I could pre|&s;erve him, and told me he had no other
<PB N="221" REF="220">
reliance or re&s;ource, could I leave him to his dreadful de&s;pondence, refu&s;e my a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand to rai&s;e him from perdition, and, to &s;ave what, after all, I am well able to &s;pare, &s;uffer a fellow-creature, who flung him&s;elf upon my mercy, to offer up his la&s;t accounts with an action blacker than any which had preceded it?&mdash;No, I cannot repent what I have done, though I lament, indeed, that the object was not more de&s;erving."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your repre&s;entation,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"like every thing el&s;e that I ever heard you utter, breathes nothing but benevolence and goodne&s;s: but your pity has been abu&s;ed, and your under&s;tanding impo&s;ed upon. Mr. Harrel had no in|tention to de&s;troy him&s;elf; the whole was an infamous trick, which, had not your genero&s;ity been too well known, would never have been played."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot think quite &s;o ill of him,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"nor for the world would I have ri&s;ked my own future reproaches by tru&s;ting to &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, which, had it proved wrong, and had Mr. Harrel, upon my refu&s;al, committed the fatal deed, would have made his murder upon my own con|&s;cience re&s;t for ever! &s;urely the experiment would have been too hazardous, when the con&s;equence had all my future peace in its power."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="221">
<Q REND="inline">"It is impo&s;&s;ible not to revere your &s;cruples,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"even while I con&s;ider them as cau&s;ele&s;s; for cau&s;ele&s;s they undoubtedly were: the man who could act &s;o atrocious a part, who could &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly pillage a young lady who was his gue&s;t and his ward, take ad|vantage of her temper for the plunder of her fortune, and extort her compliance by the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;honourable arts, meant only to terrify her into compliance, for he can be nothing le&s;s than a downright and thorough &s;coundrel, capable of every &s;pecies of mean villainy."</Q></P>
<P>He then prote&s;ted he would at lea&s;t ac|quaint her other guardians with what had pa&s;&s;ed, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it would be to en|quire if there was any chance of redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however, had not much trouble in combating this propo&s;al; for though her objections, which were merely tho&s;e of punctilious honour and delicacy, weighed nothing with a man who regarded them as ab&s;urdities, yet his own apprehen&s;ions of appearing too officious in her affairs, forced him, after a little deliberation, to give up the de&s;ign.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be&s;ides,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"as I have his bond for what I have parted with, I have, at lea&s;t, no right to complain, unle&s;s, after he receives his rents, he refu&s;es to pay me."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"His bonds! his rents!"</Q> exclaimed Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"what is a man's bond who is not worth a guinea? and what are his rents, when all he ever owned mu&s;t be &s;old before they are due, and when he will not him&s;elf receive a penny from the &s;ale, as he has neither land, hou&s;e, nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any &s;ort that is not mortgaged?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if &s;o, it is indeed all over! I am &s;orry, I am grieved!&mdash;but it is pa&s;t, and nothing, therefore, remains, but that I try to forget I ever was richer!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is very youthful philo&s;ophy,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton; <Q REND="inline">"but it will not le&s;&s;en your regret hereafter, when the value of money is better known to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I &s;hall dearly buy my experience,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"let me be the more attentive to making good u&s;e of it; and, &s;ince my lo&s;s &s;eems irremediable to my&s;elf, let me at lea&s;t endeavour to &s;ecure its utility to Mr. Harrel."</Q></P>
<P>She then told him her wi&s;h to propo&s;e to that gentleman &s;ome &s;cheme of reformation, while ye&s;terday's events were yet recent in his mind: but Mr. Monckton, who had hardly patience to hear her, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"He is a wretch, and de&s;erves the full force of the di&s;grace he is courting. What is now mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary is to guard you from
<PB N="224" REF="223">
his further machinations, for you may el&s;e be involved in ruin as deep as his own. He now knows the way to frighten you, and he will not fail to put it in practice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"he would vainly apply to me in future: I cannot repent that I ventured not ye&s;terday to brave his menaces, but too little is the comfort I feel from what I have be&s;towed, to &s;uffer any con&s;ideration to make me part with more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your re&s;olution,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"will be as feeble as your genero&s;ity will be po|tent: depend nothing upon your&s;elf, but in&s;tantly quit his hou&s;e. You will el&s;e be made re&s;pon&s;ible for every debt that he con|tracts; and whatever may be his difficulties hereafter, he will know that to extricate him&s;elf from them, he has but to talk of dying, and to &s;hew you a &s;word or a pi&s;tol."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If &s;o, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, looking down while &s;he &s;poke, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t again go to Mr. Delvile's."</Q></P>
<P>This was by no means the purpo&s;e of Mr. Monckton, who &s;aw not more danger to her fortune with one of her guardians, than to her per&s;on with the other. He ven|tured, therefore, to recommend to her a re&s;idence with Mr. Briggs, well knowing that his hou&s;e would be a &s;ecurity again&s;t her &s;eeing any man equal to him&s;elf, and
<PB N="225" REF="224">
hoping that under his roof he might again be as unrivalled in her opinion and e&s;teem, as he formerly was in the country.</P>
<P>But here the oppo&s;ition of Cecilia was too earne&s;t for any hope that it might be &s;urmounted; for, added to her di&s;like of Mr. Briggs, her repugnance to &s;uch an ha|bitation was &s;trongly, though &s;ilently en|crea&s;ed, by her &s;ecret inclination to return to St. James's-&s;quare.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mention not Mr. Briggs as an eligible ho&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, after li&s;tening to her objections, <Q REND="inline">"but merely as one more proper for you than Mr. Delvile, with whom your fixing at pre&s;ent would be but ill thought of in the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ill thought of, Sir? Why &s;o?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e he has a &s;on; for who&s;e &s;ake alone it would be univer&s;ally concluded you changed your abode: and to give any pre|tence for &s;uch a report, would by no means accord with the u&s;ual delicacy of your conduct."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was confounded by this &s;peech: the truth of the charge &s;he felt, and the pro|bability of the cen&s;ure &s;he did not dare di&s;|pute.</P>
<P>He then gave her a thou&s;and exhortations to beware of the &s;chemes and artifices of Mr. Harrel, which he fore&s;aw would be innu|merable. He told her, too, that with
<PB N="226" REF="225">
re&s;pect to Sir Robert Floyer, he thought &s;he had better &s;uffer the report to &s;ub&s;ide of it&s;elf, which in time it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do, than give to it &s;o much con&s;equence as to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to the Baronet, from which he might pretend to infer that hitherto &s;he had been wavering, or &s;he would have &s;ent to him &s;ooner.</P>
<P>But the real motive of this advice was, that as he found Sir Robert by no means to be dreaded, he hoped the report, if gene|rally circulated and credited, might keep off other pretenders, and intimidate or de|ceive young Delvile.</P>
<P>The purport for which Cecilia had wi&s;hed this conference was, however, wholly un|an&s;wered; Mr. Monckton, enraged by the conduct of Mr. Harrel, refu&s;ed to talk of his affairs, and could only mention him with dete&s;tation: but Cecilia, le&s;s &s;evere in her judgment, and more tender in her heart, would not yet give up the hope of an amendment &s;he &s;o anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed; and having now no other per&s;on to whom &s;he could apply, determined to con&s;ult with Mr. Arnott, who&s;e affection for his &s;i&s;ter would give him a zeal in the affair that might &s;omewhat &s;upply the place of &s;uperior abilities.</P>
<P>There was, indeed, no time to be lo&s;t in making the projected attempt, for no &s;ooner
<PB N="227" REF="226">
was the immediate danger of &s;uffering re|moved, than the alarm wore away, and the penitence was forgotten; every thing went on as u&s;ual, no new regulations were made, no expences abated, no plea&s;ures forborn, not a thought of hereafter admitted: and ruinous and terrible as had been the pre|ceding &s;torm, no trace of it was vi&s;ible in the &s;erenity of the pre&s;ent calm.</P>
<P>An occa&s;ion of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with Mr. Ar|nott very &s;peedily offered. Mr. Harrel &s;aid he had ob&s;erved in the looks of his friends at the Pantheon much &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;ight of him, and declared he &s;hould take yet another mea&s;ure for removing all &s;u&s;picion. This was to give a &s;plendid entertainment at his own hou&s;e to all his acquaintance, to which he meant to invite every body of any con&s;equence he had ever &s;een, and almo&s;t every body he had ever heard of, in his life.</P>
<P>Levity &s;o unfeeling, and a &s;pirit of ex|travagance &s;o irreclaimable, were hopele&s;s progno&s;tics; yet Cecilia would not de&s;i&s;t from her de&s;ign. She therefore took the earlie&s;t opportunity of &s;peaking with Mr. Arnott upon the &s;ubject, when &s;he openly expre&s;&s;ed her unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;tate of his brother's affairs, and warmly acknowledged her di&s;plea&s;ure at his di&s;&s;ipated way of life.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="227">
Mr. Arnott &s;oon &s;hewed that example was all he wanted to declare the &s;ame &s;en|timents. He owned he had long di&s;ap|proved the conduct of Mr. Harrel, and trembled at the &s;ituation of his &s;i&s;ter. They then con&s;idered what it was po&s;&s;ible to pro|po&s;e that might retrieve their affairs, and concluded that entirely to quit London for &s;ome years, was the only chance that re|mained of &s;aving them from ab&s;olute de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, therefore, though fearfully, and aver&s;e to the ta&s;k, told his &s;i&s;ter their mutual advice. She thanked him, &s;aid &s;he was much obliged to him, and would cer|tainly con&s;ider his propo&s;al, and mention it to Mr. Harrel.&mdash;Parties of plea&s;ure, how|ever, intervened, and the promi&s;e was neglected.</P>
<P>Cecilia then again &s;poke her&s;elf. Mrs. Harrel, much &s;oftened by her late acts of kindne&s;s, was no longer offended by her interference, but contented her&s;elf with confe&s;&s;ing that &s;he quite hated the country, and could only bear to live in it in &s;ummer time. And when Cecilia very earne&s;tly ex|po&s;tulated on the weakne&s;s of &s;uch an ob|jection to a &s;tep ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her future &s;afety and happine&s;s, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>&s;he could do no wor&s;e than that if already ruined,</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="228">
and therefore that &s;he thought <HI>it would be very hard to expect from her &s;uch a &s;acrifice before-hand.</HI></P>
<P>It was in vain Cecilia remon&s;trated: Mrs. Harrel's love of plea&s;ure was &s;tronger than her under&s;tanding, and therefore, though &s;he li&s;tened to her with patience, &s;he concluded with the &s;ame an&s;wer &s;he had begun.</P>
<P>Cecilia then, though almo&s;t heartle&s;s, re&s;olved upon talking with Mr. Harrel him|&s;elf: and therefore, taking an opportunity which he had not time to elude, &s;he in|genuou&s;ly told him her opinion of his dan|ger, and of the manner in which it might be avoided.</P>
<P>He paid unu&s;ual attention to her ad|vice, but &s;aid &s;he was much mi&s;taken with re&s;pect to his affairs, which he believed he &s;hould now very &s;peedily retrieve, as he had had the preceding night an uncommon <HI>run of luck,</HI> and flattered him&s;elf with being able very &s;hortly to pay all his debts, and begin the world again upon a new &s;core.</P>
<P>This open confe&s;&s;ion of gaming was but a new &s;hock to Cecilia, who &s;crupled not to repre&s;ent to him the uncertainty of &s;o ha|zardous a reliance, and the inevitable evils of &s;o de&s;tructive a practice.</P>
<P>She made not, however, the lea&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion upon his mind; he a&s;&s;ured her he
<PB N="230" REF="229">
doubted not giving her &s;hortly a good ac|count of him&s;elf, and that living in the country was a re&s;ource of de&s;peration which need not be anticipated.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though grieved and provoked by their mutual folly and blindne&s;s, could proceed no further: advice and admonition &s;he &s;pared not, but authority &s;he had none to u&s;e. She regretted her ineffectual at|tempt to Mr. Arnott, who was yet more cruelly afflicted at it; but though they con|ver&s;ed upon the &s;ubject by every oppor|tunity, they were equally unable to relate any &s;ucce&s;s from their efforts, or to devi&s;e any plan more likely to en&s;ure it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A MISTAKE.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN time young Delvile failed not to honour Cecilia's introduction of him to Mr. Harrel, by waiting upon that gentleman as &s;oon as the ill effects of his ac|cident at the Pantheon permitted him to leave his own hou&s;e. Mr. Harrel, though ju&s;t going out when he called, was defirous of being upon good terms with his family, and therefore took him up &s;tairs to pre&s;ent him to his lady, and invited him to tea and cards the next evening.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who was with Mrs. Harrel, did not &s;ee him without emotion; which was not much le&s;&s;ened by the ta&s;k of thanking him for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the Pantheon, and enquiring how he had him&s;elf fared. No &s;ign, however, of emotion appeared in re|turn, either when he fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed, or af|terwards an&s;wered her: the look of &s;olici|tude with which &s;he had been &s;o much &s;truck when they la&s;t parted was no longer di&s;cernable, and the voice of &s;en&s;ibility which had removed all her doubts, was no longer to be heard. His general ea&s;e, and
<PB N="232" REF="231">
natural gaiety were again unruffled, and though he had never &s;eemed really indiffer|ent to her, there was not the lea&s;t appear|ance of any added partiality.</P>
<P>Cecilia felt an involuntary mortification as &s;he ob&s;erved this change: yet, upon re|flection, &s;he &s;till attributed his whole beha|viour to his mi&s;take with re&s;pect to her &s;i|tuation, and therefore was but the more gratified by the preference he occa&s;ionally betrayed.</P>
<P>The invitation for the next evening was accepted, and Cecilia, for once, felt no re|pugnance to joining the company. Young Delvile again was in excellent &s;pirits; but though his chief plea&s;ure was evidently de|rived from conver&s;ing with her, &s;he had the vexation to ob&s;erve that he &s;eemed to think her the undoubted property of the Baronet, always retreating when he approached, and as careful, when next her, to yield his place if he advanced, as, when he was di&s;tant, to guard it from all others.</P>
<P>But when Sir Robert was employed at cards, all &s;cruples cea&s;ing, he neglected not to engro&s;s her almo&s;t wholly. He was eager to &s;peak to her of the affairs of Mr. Belfield, which he told her wore now a better a&s;pect. Theletter, indeed, of recommendation which he had &s;hewn to her, had failed, as the nobleman to whom it was written had al|ready
<PB N="233" REF="232">
entered into an engagement for his &s;on; but he had made application el&s;ewhere which he believed would be &s;ucce&s;sful, and he had communicated his proceedings to Mr. Belfield, who&s;e &s;pirits he hoped would recover by this pro&s;pect of employment and advantage. <Q REND="inline">"It is, however, but too true,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"that I have rather obtained his con&s;ent to the &s;teps I am taking, than his approbation of them: nor do I believe, had I previou&s;ly con&s;ulted him, I &s;hould have had even that. Di&s;appointed in his higher views, his &s;pirit is broken, and he is heart|le&s;s and hopele&s;s, &s;carce conde&s;cending to accept relief, from the bitter remembrance that he expected preferment. Time, how|ever, will blunt this acute &s;en&s;ibility, and reflection will make him blu&s;h at this un|rea&s;onable delicacy. But we mu&s;t patiently &s;ooth him till he is more him&s;elf, or while we mean to &s;erve, we &s;hall only torment him. Sickne&s;s, &s;orrow, and poverty have all fallen heavily upon him, and they have all fallen at once: we mu&s;t not, therefore, wonder to find him intractable, when his mind is as much depre&s;&s;ed, as his body is enervated."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, to whom his candour and gene|ro&s;ity always gave fre&s;h delight, &s;trengthen|ed his opinions by her concurrence, and confirmed his de&s;igns by the intere&s;t which &s;he took in them.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="233">
From this time, he found almo&s;t daily &s;ome occa&s;ion for calling in Portman|Square. The application of Cecilia in fa|vour of Mr. Belfield gave him a right to communicate to her all his proceedings con|cerning him; and he had &s;ome letter to &s;hew, &s;ome new &s;cheme to propo&s;e, &s;ome refu&s;al to lament, or &s;ome hope to rejoice over, almo&s;t perpetually: or even when the&s;e failed, Cecilia had a cold, which he came to enquire after, or Mrs. Harrel gave him an invitation, which rendered any excu&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary. But though his intimacy with Cecilia was encrea&s;ed, though his admira|tion of her was con&s;picuous, and his fond|ne&s;s for her &s;ociety &s;eemed to grow with the enjoyment of it, he yet never manife&s;ted any doubt of her engagement with the Ba|ronet, nor betrayed either intention or de|&s;ire to &s;upplant him. Cecilia, however, re|pined not much at the mi&s;take, &s;ince &s;he thought it might be in&s;trumental to procur|ing her a more impartial acquaintance with his character, than &s;he could rationally ex|pect, if, as &s;he hoped, the explanation of his error &s;hould make him &s;eek her good opinion with more &s;tudy and de&s;ign.</P>
<P>To &s;atisfy her&s;elf not only concerning the brother but the &s;i&s;ter, &s;he again vi&s;ited Mi&s;s Belfield, and had the plea&s;ure of find|ing her in better &s;pirits, and hearing that the
<PB N="235" REF="234">
<HI>noble friend</HI> of her brother, whom &s;he had al|ready mentioned, and whom Cecilia had be|fore &s;u&s;pected to be young Delvile, had now pointed out to him a method of conduct by which his affairs might be decently retriev|ed, and him&s;elf creditably employed. Mi&s;s Belfield &s;poke of the plan with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction; yet &s;he acknowledged that her mother was extremely di&s;contented with it, and that her brother him&s;elf was rather led by &s;hame than inclination to its adoption. Yet he was evidently ea&s;ier in his mind, though far from happy, and already &s;o much better, that Mr. Rupil &s;aid he would very &s;oon be able to leave his room.</P>
<P>Such was the quiet and contented &s;itua|tion of Cecilia, when one evening, which was de&s;tined for company at home, while &s;he was alone in the drawing-room, which Mrs. Harrel had ju&s;t left to an&s;wer a note, Sir Robert Floyer accidentally came up &s;tairs before the other gentlemen.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha!"</Q> cried he, the moment he &s;aw her, <Q REND="inline">"at la&s;t have I the good fortune to meet with you alone! this, indeed, is a fa|vour I thought I was always to be de|nied."</Q></P>
<P>He was then approaching her; but Ce|cilia, who &s;hrunk involuntary at the &s;ight of him, was retreating ha&s;tily to quit the room, when &s;uddenly recollecting that no better
<PB N="236" REF="235">
opportunity might ever offer for a final ex|planation with him, &s;he irre&s;olutely &s;topt; and Sir Robert, immediately following, took her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips as &s;he endeavoured to withdraw it, exclaim|ed <Q REND="inline">"You are a mo&s;t charming creature!"</Q> when the door was opened, and young Del|vile at the &s;ame moment was announced and appeared.</P>
<P>Cecilia, colouring violently, and extreme|ly chagrined, ha&s;tily di&s;engaged her&s;elf from his hold. Delvile &s;eemed uncertain whether he ought not to retire, which Sir Robert perceiving, bowed to him with an air of mingled triumph and vexation, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Sir your mo&s;t obedient!"</Q></P>
<P>The doubt, however, in which every one appeared of what was next to be done, was immediately removed by the return of Mrs. Harrel, and the arrival at almo&s;t the &s;ame moment of more company.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the evening was &s;pent, on the part of Cecilia, mo&s;t painfully: the expla|nation &s;he had planned had ended in wor&s;e than nothing, for by &s;uffering the Baronet to detain her, &s;he had rather &s;hewn a di&s;po|&s;ition to oblige, than any intention to di&s;|card him; and the &s;ituation in which &s;he had been &s;urpri&s;ed by young Delvile, was the la&s;t to clear the &s;u&s;picions &s;he &s;o little wi&s;hed him to harbour: while, on his part,
<PB N="237" REF="236">
the accident &s;eemed to occa&s;ion no other al|teration than that of rendering him more than u&s;ually a&s;&s;iduous to give way to Sir Robert whenever he approached her.</P>
<P>Nor was Sir Robert &s;lack in taking ad|vantage of this attention: he was highly in &s;pirits, talked to her with more than com|mon freedom, and wore the whole evening an air of exulting &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Cecilia, provoked by this pre&s;umption, hurt by the behaviour of young Delvile, and mortified by the whole affair, deter|mined to leave this mi&s;take no longer in the power of accident, but to apply immedi|ately to Mr. Delvile &s;enior, and de&s;ire him, as her guardian, to wait upon Sir Robert him&s;elf, and acquaint him that his per&s;eve|rance in pur&s;uing her was both u&s;ele&s;s and offen&s;ive: and by this method &s;he hoped at once to di&s;entangle her&s;elf for ever from the Baronet, and to di&s;cover more fully the &s;entiments of young Delvile: for the pro|vocation &s;he had ju&s;t endured, robbed her of all patience for waiting the advice of Mr. Monckton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. AN EXPLANATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following morning, therefore, Ce|cilia went early to St. James's Square: and, after the u&s;ual ceremonies of me&s;&s;ages and long waiting, &s;he was &s;hewn into an apartment where &s;he found Mr. Delvile and his &s;on.</P>
<P>She rejoiced to &s;ee them together, and de|termined to make known to them both the purport of her vi&s;it: and therefore, after &s;ome apologies and a little he&s;itation, &s;he told Mr. Delvile, that encouraged by his offers of &s;erving her, &s;he had taken the li|berty to call upon him with a view to en|treat his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Young Delvile, immediately ari&s;ing, would have quitted the room; but Cecilia, a&s;&s;uring him &s;he rather de&s;ired what &s;he had to &s;ay &s;hould be known than kept &s;ecret, begged that he would not di&s;turb him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Delvile, plea&s;ed with this permi&s;&s;ion to hear her, and curious to know what would follow, very readily returned to his &s;eat.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould by no means,"</Q> &s;he continued,
<PB N="239" REF="238">
<Q REND="inline">"have thought of proclaiming even to the mo&s;t intimate of my friends, the partiality which Sir Robert Floyer has been plea&s;ed to &s;hew me, had he left to me the choice of publi&s;hing or concealing it: but, on the contrary, his own behaviour &s;eems intend|ed not merely to di&s;play it, but to in&s;inu|ate that it meets with my approbation. Mr. Harrel, al&s;o, urged by too much warmth of friend&s;hip, has encouraged this belief; nor, indeed, do I know at pre&s;ent where the mi&s;take &s;tops, nor what it is report has not &s;crupled to affirm. But I think I ought no longer to neglect it, and therefore I have pre&s;umed to &s;olicit your advice in what manner I may mo&s;t effectually contradict it."</Q></P>
<P>The extreme &s;urpri&s;e of young Delvile at this &s;peech was not more evident than plea&s;ant to Cecilia, to whom it accounted for all that had perplext her in his conduct, while it animated every expectation &s;he wi&s;hed to encourage.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The behaviour of Mr. Harrel,"</Q> an|&s;wered Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"has by no means been &s;uch as to lead me to forget that his father was the &s;on of a &s;teward of Mr. Grant, who lived in the neighbourhood of my friend and relation the Duke of Derwent: nor can I &s;ufficiently congratulate my&s;elf that I have always declined acting with him. The late
<PB N="240" REF="239">
Dean, indeed, never committed &s;o &s;trange an impropriety as that of nominating Mr. Harrel and Mr. Briggs coadjutors with Mr. Delvile. The impropriety, however, though extremely offen&s;ive to me, has never oblite|rated from my mind the e&s;teem I bore the Dean: nor can I po&s;&s;ibly give a greater proof of it than the readine&s;s I have always &s;hewn to offer my coun&s;el and in&s;truction to his neice. Mr. Harrel, therefore, ought certainly to have de&s;ired Sir Robert Floyer to acquaint me with his propo&s;als before he gave to him any an&s;wer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Undoubtedly, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, wil|ling to &s;horten this parading harangue, <Q REND="inline">"but as he neglected that intention, will you think me too impertinent &s;hould I entreat the fa|vour of you to &s;peak with Sir Robert your|&s;elf, and explain to him the total inefficacy of his pur&s;uit, &s;ince my determination a|gain&s;t him is unalterable?"</Q></P>
<P>Here the conference was interrupted by the entrance of a &s;ervant who &s;aid &s;omething to Mr. Delvile, which occa&s;ioned his apo|logizing to Cecilia for leaving her for a few moments, and o&s;tentatiou&s;ly a&s;&s;uring her that no bu&s;ine&s;s, however important, &s;hould prevent his thinking of her affairs, or detain him from returning to her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment of young Delvile at the

&s;trength of her la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion kept him &s;ilent &s;ome time after his father left the room; and then, with a countenance that &s;till marked his amazement, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible, Mi&s;s Beverley, that I &s;hould twice have been thus egregiou&s;ly deceived? or rather, that the whole town, and even the mo&s;t intimate of your friends, &s;hould &s;o unaccountably have per&s;i&s;ted in a mi&s;take."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For the town,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I know not how it can have had any concern in &s;o &s;mall a matter; but for my intimate friends, I have too few to make it probable they &s;hould ever have been &s;o &s;trangely mi&s;informed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"it was from one who ought to know, that I had my&s;elf the intelligence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I intreat you, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to acquaint me who it was?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Harrel him&s;elf; who communi|cated it to a lady in my hearing, and at a public place."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia ca&s;t up her eyes in wonder and in|dignation at a proof &s;o incontrovertible of his fal&s;ehood, but made not any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Even yet,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"I can &s;carcely feel undeceived; your engagement &s;eemed &s;o po&s;itive, your connexion &s;o irre|trievable,&mdash;&s;o,&mdash;&s;o <HI>fixed,</HI> I mean,&mdash;"</Q> He he&s;itated, a little embarra&s;&s;ed; but then

&s;uddenly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Yet whence, if to <HI>neither</HI> favourable, if indifferent alike to Sir Robert and to Belfield, whence that ani|mated apprehen&s;ion for their &s;afety at the Opera-hou&s;e? whence that never to be for|gotten <HI>oh &s;top him! good God! will nobody &s;top him!</HI>&mdash;Words of anxiety &s;o tender! and &s;ounds that &s;till vibrate in my ear!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;truck with amazement in her turn at the &s;trength of his own expre&s;&s;ions, blu&s;hed, and for a few minutes he&s;itated how to an&s;wer him: but then, to leave no|thing that related to &s;o di&s;agreeable a re|port in any doubt, &s;he re&s;olved to tell him ingenuou&s;ly the circum&s;tances that had oc|ca&s;ioned her alarm: and therefore, though with &s;ome pain to her mode&s;ty, &s;he confe&s;|&s;ed her fears that &s;he had her&s;elf provoked the affront, though her only view had been to di&s;countenance Sir Robert, without meaning to &s;hew any di&s;tinction to Mr. Bel|field.</P>
<P>Delvile, who &s;eemed charmed with the candour of this explanation, &s;aid, when &s;he had fini&s;hed it, <Q REND="inline">"You are then at liberty?&mdash;Ah madam!&mdash;how many may rue &s;o dangerous a di&s;covery!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Could you think,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, en|deavouring to &s;peak with her u&s;ual ea&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"that Sir Robert Floyer would be found &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="242">
<Q REND="inline">"Oh no!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"far otherwi&s;e; a thou&s;and times I have wondered at his happine&s;s; a thou&s;and times, when I have looked at you, and li&s;tened to you, I have thought it impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;yet my authority &s;eemed indi&s;putable. And how was I to di&s;credit what was not uttered as a conjec|ture, but a&s;&s;erted as a fact? a&s;&s;erted, too, by the guardian with whom you lived? and not hinted as a &s;ecret, but affirmed as a point &s;ettled?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet &s;urely,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"you have heard me make u&s;e of expre&s;&s;ions that could not but lead you to &s;uppo&s;e there was &s;ome mi&s;take, whatever might be the authority which had won your belief."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"I never &s;uppo&s;ed any mi&s;take, though &s;ometimes I thought you repented your engagement. I con|cluded, indeed, you had been unwarily drawn in, and I have even, at times, been tempted to acknowledge my &s;u&s;picions to you, &s;tate your independence, and exhort you&mdash;as a <HI>friend,</HI> exhort you&mdash;to u&s;e it with &s;pirit, and, if you were &s;hackled un|willingly, incautiou&s;ly, or unworthily, to break the chains by which you were con|fined, and re&s;tore to your&s;elf that freedom of choice upon the u&s;e of which all your happine&s;s mu&s;t ultimately depend. But I doubted if this were honourable to the Ba|ronet,
<PB N="244" REF="243">
&mdash;and what, indeed, was my right to &s;uch a liberty? none that every man might not be proud of, a wi&s;h to do honour to my&s;elf, under the officious pretence of &s;erv|ing the mo&s;t amiable of women."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Harrel,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"has been &s;o &s;trangely biggotted to his friend, that in his eagerne&s;s to manife&s;t his regard for him, he &s;eems to have forgotten every other con|&s;ideration; he would not, el&s;e, have &s;pread &s;o widely a report that could &s;o ill &s;tand en|quiry.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If Sir Robert,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"is him|&s;elf deceived while he deceives others, who can forbear to pity him? for my own part, in&s;tead of repining that hitherto I have been mi&s;taken, ought I not rather to ble&s;s an error that may have been my pre&s;ervative from danger?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in what manner to &s;up|port her part in the conver&s;ation, began now to wi&s;h the return of Mr. Delvile; and, not knowing what el&s;e to &s;ay, &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at his long ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not, indeed, well timed,"</Q> &s;aid young Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"ju&s;t now,&mdash;at the mo|ment when&mdash;"</Q> he &s;topt, and pre&s;ently ex|claiming <Q REND="inline">"Oh dangerous interval!"</Q> he aro&s;e from his &s;eat in manife&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>Cecilia aro&s;e too, and ha&s;tily ringing the bell, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile I am &s;ure is de|tained,
<PB N="245" REF="244">
and therefore I will order my chair, and call another time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do I frighten you away?"</Q> &s;aid he, a&s;&s;uming an appearance more placid.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but I would not ha&s;ten Mr. Delvile."</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ervant then came, and &s;aid the chair was ready.</P>
<P>She would immediately have followed him, but young Delvile again &s;peaking, &s;he &s;topt a moment to hear him. <Q REND="inline">"I fear,"</Q> &s;aid he, with much he&s;itation, <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;trangely expo&s;ed my&s;elf&mdash;and that you cannot&mdash;but the extreme a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;"</Q> he &s;topt again, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and then adding <Q REND="inline">"you will permit me to attend you to the chair,"</Q> he handed her down &s;tairs, and in quitting her, bowed without &s;aying a word more.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who was almo&s;t wholly indiffer|ent to every part of the explanation but that which had actually pa&s;&s;ed, was now in a &s;tate of felicity more delightful than any &s;he had ever experienced. She had not a doubt remaining of her influence over the mind of young Delvile, and the &s;urpri&s;e which had made him rather betray than expre&s;s his re|gard, was infinitely more flattering and &s;a|tisfactory to her than any formal or direct declaration. She had now convinced him &s;he was di&s;engaged, and in return, though
<PB N="246" REF="245">
without &s;eeming to intend it, he had con|vinced her of the deep intere&s;t which he took in the di&s;covery. His perturbation, the words which e&s;caped him, and his evident &s;truggle to &s;ay no more, were proofs ju&s;t &s;uch as &s;he wi&s;hed to receive of his partial admiration, &s;ince while they &s;atisfied her heart, they al&s;o &s;oothed her pride, by &s;hew|ing a diffidence of &s;ucce&s;s which a&s;&s;ured her that her own &s;ecret was &s;till &s;acred, and that no weakne&s;s or inadvertency on her part had robbed her of the power of mingling digni|ty with the frankne&s;s with which &s;he meant to receive his addre&s;&s;es. All, therefore, that now employed her care, was to keep off any indi&s;&s;oluble engagement till each &s;hould be better known to the other.</P>
<P>For this re&s;erve, however, &s;he had le&s;s immediate occa&s;ion than &s;he expected; &s;he &s;aw no more of young Delvile that day; neither did he appear the next. The third &s;he fully expected him,&mdash;but &s;till he came not. And while &s;he wondered at an ab|&s;ence &s;o uncommon, &s;he received a note from Lord Ernolf, to beg permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon her for two minutes, at any time &s;he would appoint.</P>
<P>She readily &s;ent word that &s;he &s;hould be at home for the re&s;t of the day, as &s;he wi&s;h|ed much for an opportunity of immediately fini&s;hing every affair but one, and &s;etting
<PB N="247" REF="246">
her mind at liberty to think only of that which &s;he de&s;ired &s;hould pro&s;per.</P>
<P>Lord Ernolf was with her in half an hour. She found him &s;en&s;ible and well bred, ex|tremely de&s;irous to promote her alliance with his &s;on, and apparently as much plea&s;|ed with her&s;elf as with her fortune. He ac|quainted her that he had addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr. Harrel long &s;ince, but had been in|formed that &s;he was actually engaged to Sir Robert Floyer: he &s;hould, therefore, have forborn taking up any part of her time, had he not, the preceding day, while on a vi&s;it at Mr. Delvile's, been a&s;&s;ured that Mr. Har|rel was mi&s;taken, and that &s;he had not yet declared for any body. He hoped, there|fore, that &s;he would allow his &s;on the ho|nour of waiting upon her, and permit him to talk with Mr. Briggs, who he under&s;tood was her acting guardian, upon &s;uch matters as ought to be &s;peedily adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him for the honour he in|tended her, and confirmed the truth of the account he had heard in St. James's-&s;quare, but at the &s;ame time told him &s;he mu&s;t de|cline receiving any vi&s;its from his lord&s;hip's &s;on, and intreated him to take no mea&s;ure towards the promotion of an affair which never could &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed much concerned at her an|&s;wer, and endeavoured for &s;ome time to
<PB N="248" REF="247">
&s;offen her, but found her &s;o &s;teady, though civil in her refu&s;al, that he was obliged, however unwillingly, to give up his at|tempt.</P>
<P>Cecilia, when he was gone, reflected with much vexation on the readine&s;s of the Del|vile's to encourage his vi&s;it; &s;he con&s;ider|ed, however, that the intelligence he had heard might po&s;&s;ibly be gathered in gene|ral conver&s;ation; but &s;he blamed her&s;elf that &s;he had not led to &s;ome enquiry what part of the family he had &s;een, and who was pre&s;ent when the information was given him.</P>
<P>Mean while &s;he found that neither cold|ne&s;s, di&s;tance, nor aver&s;ion were &s;ufficient to repre&s;s Sir Robert Floyer, who continu|ed to per&s;ecute her with as much confi|dence of &s;ucce&s;s as could have ari&s;en from the utmo&s;t encouragement. She again, though with much difficulty, contrived to &s;peak with Mr. Harrel upon the &s;ubject, and openly accu&s;ed him of &s;preading a re|port abroad, as well as countenancing an expectation at home, that had neither truth nor ju&s;tice to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, with his u&s;ual levity and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, laughed at the charge, but de|nied any belief in her di&s;plea&s;ure, and af|fected to think &s;he was merely playing the coquet, while Sir Robert was not the le&s;s her decided choice.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="248">
Provoked and wearied, Cecilia re&s;olved no longer to depend upon any body but her&s;elf for the management of her own af|fairs, and therefore, to conclude the bu&s;i|ne&s;s without any po&s;&s;ibility of further ca|villing, &s;he wrote the following note to Sir Robert her&s;elf.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir ROBERT FLOYER, Bart.</HEAD>
<P>MISS BEVERLEY pre&s;ents her compliments to Sir Robert Floyer, and as &s;he has &s;ome rea&s;on to fear Mr. Harrel did not explicitly acquaint him with her an&s;wer to the com|mi&s;&s;ion with which he was entru&s;ted, &s;he thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to obviate any po&s;&s;ible mi&s;under&s;tanding, to take this me|thod of returning him thanks for the ho|nour of his good opinion, but of begging at the &s;ame time that he would not lo&s;e a mo|ment upon her account, as her thanks are all &s;he can now, or ever, offer in return.</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>Portman-&s;quare, <DATE>May 11th, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>To this note Cecilia received no an&s;wer: but &s;he had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve that Sir Robert forbore his u&s;ual vi&s;it on the day &s;he &s;ent it, and, though he appeared again the day following, he never &s;poke to her, and &s;eemed &s;ullen and out of humour.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="249">
Yet &s;till young Delvile came not, and &s;till, as her &s;urpri&s;e encrea&s;ed, her tranqui|lity was dimini&s;hed. She could form no excu&s;e for his delay, nor conjecture any rea|&s;on for his ab&s;ence. Every motive &s;eemed to favour his &s;eeking, and not one his &s;hun|ning her: the explanation which had &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed had informed him he had no rival to fear, and the manner in which he had heard it a&s;&s;ured her the information was not indifferent to him; why, then, &s;o a&s;&s;i|duous in his vi&s;its when he thought her en|gaged, and &s;o &s;lack in all attendance when he knew &s;he was at liberty?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. A MURMURING.</HEAD>
<P>UNABLE to relieve her&s;elf from this perplexity, Cecilia, to divert her cha|grin, again vi&s;ited Mi&s;s Belfield. She had then the plea&s;ure to hear that her brother was much recovered, and had been able, the preceding day, to take an airing, which he had borne &s;o well that Mr. Rupil had charged him to u&s;e the &s;ame exerci&s;e every morning.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And will he?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, I am &s;adly afraid not,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"for coach hire is very ex|pen&s;ive, and we are willing, now, to &s;ave all we can in order to help fitting him out for going abroad."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then earne&s;tly entreated her to ac|cept &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;he a&s;&s;ured her &s;he did not dare without the con&s;ent of her mother, which, however, &s;he undertook to obtain.</P>
<P>The next day, when Cecilia called to hear her &s;ucce&s;s, Mrs. Belfield, who hitherto had kept out of &s;ight, made her appearance.
<PB N="252" REF="251">
She found her, alike in per&s;on, manners and conver&s;ation, a cour&s;e and ordinary wo|man, not more unlike her &s;on in talents and acquired accompli&s;hments, than di&s;&s;imilar to her daughter in &s;oftne&s;s and natural de|licacy.</P>
<P>The moment Cecilia was &s;eated, &s;he be|gan, without waiting for any ceremony, or requiring any &s;olicitation, abruptly to talk of her affairs, and repiningly to relate her misfortunes.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I find, madam,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"you have been &s;o kind as to vi&s;it my daughter Henny a great many times, but as I have no time for company, I have always kept out of the way, having other things to do than &s;it &s;till to talk. I have had a &s;ad time of it here, ma'am, with my poor &s;on's illne&s;s, having no conveniencies about me, and much ado to make him mind me; for he's all for ha|ving his own way, poor dear &s;oul, and I'm &s;ure I don't know who could contradict <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">m, for it's what I never had the heart to do. But then, ma'am, what is to come of it? You &s;ee how bad things go! for though I have got a very good income, it won't do for every thing. And if it was as much again, I &s;hould want to &s;ave it all now. For here my poor &s;on, you &s;ee, is reduced all in a minute, as one may &s;ay, from be|ing one of the fir&s;t gentlemen in the town,

to a mere poor object, without a farthing in the world!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is, however, I hope now much bet|ter in his health?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam, thank heaven, for if he was wor&s;e, tho&s;e might tell of it that would, for I'm &s;ure I &s;hould never live to hear of it. He has been the be&s;t &s;on in the world, madam, and u&s;ed nothing but the be&s;t com|pany, for I &s;pared neither pains nor co&s;t to bring him up genteely, and I believe there's not a nobleman in the land that looks more the gentleman. However, there's come no good of it, for though his acquaintances was all among the fir&s;t quality, he never re|ceived the value of a penny from the be&s;t of them. So I have no great need to be proud. But I meant for the be&s;t, though I have often enough wi&s;hed I had not meddled in the matter, but left him to be brought up in the &s;hop, as his father was before him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His pre&s;ent plan, however,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"will I hope make you ample amends both for your &s;ufferings and your tender|ne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, madam, when he's going to leave me, and &s;ettle in foreign parts? If you was a mother your&s;elf, madam, you would not think that &s;uch good amends."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Settle?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"No, he only goes for a year or two."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's more than I can &s;ay, madam,

<P><Q REND="inline">"You will &s;till have your daughter, and &s;he &s;eems &s;o amiable, that I am &s;ure you can want no con&s;olation &s;he will not endeavour to give you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what is a daughter, madam, to &s;uch a &s;on as mine? a &s;on that I thought to have &s;een living like a prince, and &s;ending his own coach for me to dine with him! And now he's going to be taken away from me, and nobody knows if I &s;hall live till he comes back. But I may thank my&s;elf, for if I had but been content to &s;ee him brought up in the &s;hop&mdash;yet all the world would have cried &s;hame upon it, for when he was quite a child in arms, the people u&s;ed all to &s;ay he was born to be a gentleman, and would live to make many a fine lady's heart ache."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If he can but make <HI>your</HI> heart ea&s;y,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"we will not grieve that the fine ladies &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d e&s;cape the pro|phecy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, ma'am, I don't mean by that to &s;ay he has been over gay among the ladies, for it's a thing I never heard of him; and I dare

&s;ay if any lady was to take a fancy to him, &s;he'd find there was not a mode&s;ter young man in the world.

<P><Q REND="inline">"He will yet, I hope,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"make you rejoice in all your kindne&s;s to him: his health is already returning, and his affairs wear again a more pro&s;perous a&s;pect."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But do you &s;uppo&s;e, ma'am, that having him &s;ent two or three hundred miles away from me, with &s;ome young ma&s;ter to take care of, is the way to make up to me what I have gone through for him? why I u&s;ed to deny my&s;elf every thing in the world, in order to &s;ave money to buy him &s;mart cloaths, and let him go to the Opera, and Ranelagh, and &s;uch &s;ort of places, that he might keep him&s;elf in fortune's way! and now you &s;ee the end of it! here he is, in a little &s;habby room up two pair of &s;tairs, with not one of the great folks coming near him, to &s;ee if he's &s;o much as dead or alive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do not wonder,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that you re&s;ent their &s;hewing &s;o little gratitude for the plea&s;ure and entertainment they have formerly received from him: but com|fort

your&s;elf that it will at lea&s;t &s;ecure you from any &s;imilar di&s;appointment, as Mr. Belfield will, in future, be guarded from forming &s;uch precarious expectations."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what good will that do me, ma'am, for all the money he has been throwing after them all this while? do you think I would have &s;craped it up for him, and gone without every thing in the world, to &s;ee it all end in this manner? why he might as well have been brought up the commone&s;t journey|man, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> comfort I &s;hall have of him at this rate.

<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t not,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"in|dulge &s;uch fears; I doubt not but your &s;on will return well, and return all that you wi&s;h."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nobody knows that, ma'am; and the only way to be certain is for him not to go at all; and I'm &s;urpri&s;ed, ma'am, you can wi&s;h him to make &s;uch a journey to nobody knows where, with nothing but a young ma&s;ter that he mu&s;t as good as teach his A.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, amazed at this accu&s;ation, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not wi&s;h him to go abroad, if any thing more eligible could be done by his remaining in England: but as no pro&s;pect of that &s;ort &s;eems before him,

you mu&s;t endeavour to reconcile your&s;elf to parting with him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, but how am I to do that, when I don't know if ever I &s;hall &s;ee him again? Who could have thought of his living &s;o among the great folks, and then coming to want! I'm &s;ure I thought they'd have pro|vided for him like a &s;on of their own, for he u&s;ed to go about to all the public places ju&s;t as they did them&s;elves. Day after day I u&s;ed to be counting for when he would come to tell me he'd got a place at court, or &s;omething of that &s;ort, for I never could tell what it would be: and then the next news I heard, was that he was &s;hut up in this poor bit of place, with nobody troubling their heads about him! however, I'll never be per&s;uaded but he might have done better, if he would but have &s;poke a good word for him&s;elf, or el&s;e have let me done it for him: in&s;tead of which, he never would &s;o much as let me &s;ee any of his grand friends, though I would not have made the lea&s;t &s;cruple in the world to have a&s;ked them for any thing he had a mind to."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia again endeavoured to give her comfort; but finding her only &s;atisfaction was to expre&s;s her di&s;content, &s;he aro&s;e to take leave. But, turning fir&s;t to Mi&s;s Bel|field, contrived to make a private enquiry whether &s;he might repeat her offer of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
<PB N="258" REF="257">
A downca&s;t and dejected look an|&s;wering in the affirmative, &s;he put into her hand a ten pound bank note, and wi&s;hing them good morning, hurried out of the room.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Belfield was running after her, but &s;topt by her mother, who called out, <Q REND="inline">"What is it?&mdash;How much is it?&mdash;Let me look at it!"</Q>&mdash;And then, following Cecilia her&s;elf, &s;he thanked her aloud all the way down &s;tairs for her <HI>genteelne&s;s,</HI> a&s;&s;uring her &s;he would not fail making it known to her &s;on.</P>
<P>Cecilia at this declaration turned back, and exhorted her by no means to mention it; after which &s;he got into her chair, and returned home; pitying Mi&s;s Belfield for the unju&s;t partiality &s;hewn to her brother, and excu&s;ing the proud &s;hame he had ma|nife&s;ted of his relations, from the vulgarity and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of her who was at the head of them.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t a fortnight had now elap&s;ed &s;ince her explanation with young Delvile, yet not once had he been in Portman-&s;quare, though in the fortnight which had preceded, &s;carce a day had pa&s;&s;ed which had not afforded him &s;ome pretence for calling there.</P>
<P>At length a note arrived from Mrs. Delvile. It contained the mo&s;t flattering reproaches for her long ab&s;ence, and a
<PB N="259" REF="258">
pre&s;&s;ing invitation that &s;he would dine and &s;pend the next day with her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who had merely denied her|&s;elf the plea&s;ure of this vi&s;it from an ap|prehen&s;ion of &s;eeming too de&s;irous of keep|ing up the connexion, now, from the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of propriety, determined upon making it, wi&s;hing equally to avoid all appearance of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, either by &s;eeking or avoid|ing the intimacy of the family.</P>
<P>Not a little was her anxiety to know in what manner young Delvile would receive her, whether he would be grave or gay, agi|tated, as during their la&s;t conver&s;ation, or ea&s;y, as in the meetings which had pre|ceded it.</P>
<P>She found Mrs. Delvile, however, alone; and, extremely kind to her, yet much &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and half di&s;plea&s;ed, that &s;he had &s;o long been ab&s;ent. Cecilia, though &s;ome|what di&s;tre&s;&s;ed what excu&s;es to offer, was happy to find her&s;elf &s;o highly in favour, and not very reluctant to promi&s;e more fre|quent vi&s;its in future.</P>
<P>They were then &s;ummoned to dinner; but &s;till no young Delvile was vi&s;ible: they were joined only by his father, and &s;he found that no one el&s;e was expected.</P>
<P>Her a&s;toni&s;hment now was greater than ever, and &s;he could account by no po&s;&s;ible conjecture for a conduct &s;o extraordinary.
<PB N="260" REF="259">
Hitherto, whenever &s;he had vi&s;ited in St. James's-&s;quare by appointment, the air with which he had received her, con&s;tantly announced that he had impatiently waited her arrival; he had given up other engage|ments to &s;tay with her, he had openly ex|pre&s;&s;ed his hopes that &s;he would never be long ab&s;ent, and &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in her &s;ociety to which every other was inferior. And now, how &s;triking the dif|ference! he forbore all vi&s;its at the hou&s;e where &s;he re&s;ided, he even flew from his own when he knew &s;he was approaching it!</P>
<P>Nor was this the only vexation of which this day was productive; Mr. Delvile, when the &s;ervants were withdrawn after dinner, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern that he had been called from her during their la&s;t con|ver&s;ation, and added that he would take the pre&s;ent opportunity to talk with her upon &s;ome matters of importance.</P>
<P>He then began the u&s;ual parading pre|lude, which, upon all occa&s;ions, he thought nece&s;&s;ary, in order to enhance the value of his interpo&s;ition, remind her of her infe|riority, and impre&s;s her with a deeper &s;en&s;e of the honour which his guardian&s;hip con|ferred upon her: after which, he proceeded to make a formal enquiry whether &s;he had po&s;itively di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Sir Robert Floyer?</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="260">
She a&s;&s;ured him &s;he had.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tood my Lord Ernolf,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that you had totally di&s;couraged the addre&s;&s;es of his &s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for I never mean to receive them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you, then, any other engage|ment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">No, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, colouring between &s;hame and di&s;plea&s;ure, <Q REND="inline">"none at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is a very extraordinary circum|&s;tance!"</Q> replied he: <Q REND="inline">"the &s;on of an earl to be rejected by a young woman of no family, and yet no rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it!"</Q></P>
<P>This contemptuous &s;peech &s;o cruelly &s;hocked Cecilia, that though he continued to harangue her for a great part of the after|noon, &s;he only an&s;wered him when com|pelled by &s;ome que&s;tion, and was &s;o evi|dently di&s;compo&s;ed, that Mrs. Delvile, who perceived her unea&s;ine&s;s with much con|cern, redoubled her civilities and care&s;&s;es, and u&s;ed every method in her power to oblige and enliven her.</P>
<P>Cecilia was not ungrateful for her care, and &s;hewed her &s;en&s;e of it by added re&s;pect and attention; but her mind was di&s;turbed, and &s;he quitted the hou&s;e as &s;oon as &s;he was able.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile's &s;peech, from her previous knowledge of the extreme haughtine&s;s of his
<PB N="262" REF="261">
character, would not have occa&s;ioned her the &s;malle&s;t emotion, had it merely related to him or to her&s;elf: but as it concerned Lord Ernolf, &s;he regarded it as al&s;o con|cerning his &s;on, and &s;he found that, far from trying to promote the union Mr. Monckton had told her he had planned, he did not &s;eem even to think of it, but, on the contrary, propo&s;ed and &s;econded with all his intere&s;t another alliance.</P>
<P>This, added to the behaviour of young Delvile, made her &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome en|gagement was in agitation on his own part, and that while &s;he thought him &s;o &s;edulous only to avoid her, he was &s;imply occupied in &s;eeking another. This painful &s;ug|ge&s;tion, which every thing &s;eemed to con|firm, again over&s;et all her &s;chemes, and de|&s;troyed all her vi&s;ionary happine&s;s. Yet how to reconcile it with what had pa&s;&s;ed at their la&s;t meeting &s;he knew not; &s;he had then every rea&s;on to believe that his heart was in her power, and that courage, or an opportunity more &s;ea&s;onable, was all he wanted to make known his devotion to her; why, then, &s;hun if he loved her? why, if he loved her not, &s;eem &s;o perturbed at the explanation of her independance?</P>
<P>A very little time, however, &s;he hoped would unravel this my&s;tery; in two days, the entertainment which Mr. Harrel had
<PB N="263" REF="262">
planned, to deceive the world by an ap|pearance of affluence to which he had lo&s;t all title, was to take place; young Delvile, in common with every other per&s;on who had ever been &s;een at the hou&s;e, had early received an invitation, which he had readily promi&s;ed to accept &s;ome time before the conver&s;ation that &s;eemed the period of their acquaintance had pa&s;&s;ed. Should he, after being &s;o long engaged, fail to keep his appointment, &s;he could no longer have any doubt of the ju&s;tice of her conjecture; &s;hould he, on the contrary, again appear, from his behaviour and his looks &s;he might perhaps be able to gather why he had &s;o long been ab&s;ent.</P>
