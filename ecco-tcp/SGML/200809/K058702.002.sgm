<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter upon the immediate &s;ubject matter of the pre&s;ent volume, a few words &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, partly by way of explanation, partly of apology.</P>
<P>The delay which has attended the pub|lication of it &s;eems to &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf as the fir&s;t &s;ubject of remark. For this, and in|deed, for mo&s;t of the errors and imperfec|tions of the work, the author has but one excu&s;e to offer: the uncea&s;ing bu&s;tle and di&s;traction of an occupation, of which none but tho&s;e who have experienced it, can form an adequate conception. It was his intention that the pre&s;ent volume &s;hould have immediately, or at lea&s;t by a very &s;hort interval, followed the former. But
<PB REF="3">
the rea&s;on alledged has put it totally out of his power to accompli&s;h it &s;ooner than he has done.</P>
<P>The &s;ame excu&s;e, he hopes, will be ex|tended to the many deficiencies under which he is con&s;cious the work labours. Several circum&s;tances concur to render the volume now &s;ubmitted to public in|&s;pection, of a nature more difficult and more delicate, than that of the preceding. The period which it compri&s;es coming &s;o much nearer to the pre&s;ent day, mu&s;t of cour&s;e involve events more within the re|collection of many per&s;ons living, and cir|cum&s;tances in which their per&s;onal feel|ings may frequently be intere&s;ted. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;hould any thing chance to have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, he reque&s;ts the error may be imputed to the &s;ingle cau&s;e already alledged; want of &s;ufficient lei&s;ure. He has endeavoured to be as accurate as po&s;|&s;ible. If he has failed, it has been through ignorance, not intention.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">With re&s;pect to the per&s;ons mentioned in the following pages, many of them are &s;till living, many have their &s;urviving friends. To the feelings of the&s;e &s;everal per&s;ons he hopes that nothing which is there related can give offence. In &s;peak|ing both of characters and events, the at|tainment of truth has been his con&s;tant endeavour. In all ca&s;es, which would admit of the alternative, he has even lean|ed to the &s;ide of prai&s;e, rather than to that of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Another objection which may probably be rai&s;ed again&s;t the pre&s;ent volume, is that it is incomplete. The original propo|&s;als for the work, and even the title page it&s;elf, profe&s;s to come down to the end of the year 1788. The pre&s;ent volume clo&s;es with the year 1774. For this defi|ciency the nature of the &s;ubject mu&s;t be the excu&s;e. The nearer we approached to the time in which we live, the greater was the number of circum&s;tances known, and nece&s;&s;ary to be related.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">The endeavour of the writer has been rather to compre&s;s than to diffu&s;e facts. Yet even &s;o, the period at fir&s;t marked out was found to contain more than was expected, and more than would fall within the ordinary limits of a volume. The rea|&s;on why the year 1774 in particular has been cho&s;en for a termination, is that the &s;ea&s;on preceding had been remarkable both for its &s;ucce&s;s and its excellence, and that the &s;tage of Ireland had at that time at|tained a di&s;tingui&s;hed degree of eminence. For in the choice of a re&s;ting place, it is natural to fix on that which affords the faire&s;t pro&s;pect. Whether the work &s;hall be thought worthy of further continuance will be matter for public opinion.</P>
<P>Such as it is, the author &s;ubmits the following volume to in&s;pection. He is as con&s;cious as any per&s;on can be, of its de|fects. But he is per&s;uaded that it will meet with every candid indulgence.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Situation of the two Theatres at the end of the year <HI>1759</HI>&mdash;Mr. Brown a&s;&s;umes the direction of Smock-Alley&mdash;The Crow-&s;treet Managers en|gage Mr. Mo&s;&s;op and Mr. Foote&mdash;Are appointed deputy ma&s;ters of the revels&mdash;Li&s;t of their com|pany&mdash;New performers&mdash;Mi&s;s Ro&s;co&mdash;Mi&s;s O&s;borne&mdash;Honoured by the pre&s;ence of the Duke and Duche&s;s of Dor&s;et&mdash;Mo&s;&s;op opens in Zanga&mdash; Barry in Ore&s;tes&mdash;Foote in Fondlewife&mdash;Reception of Admiral Saunders at the Theatre.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE detail of events, with which the former volume of this work concluded, has brought us to the termination of the theatrical campaign in May 1759. We have been there pre&s;ented
<PB N="2" REF="16">
with that variety of unexpected and of unhappy occurrences by which Mr. Sheridan, after the continued exertions of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years to &s;u&s;tain the dignity of the dramatic throne of this kingdom, was at once compelled to re&s;ign its &s;eptre, and to yield its empire to his more fortunate competitors. The period, therefore, which has been mentioned, &s;aw Me&s;&s;rs. Barry and Woodward in unrivalled po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, exult|ing in the plenitude of their theatric power.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with this extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s, and highly elate with their conque&s;ts, the joint managers of Crow-&s;treet, beheld, in imagination, their utmo&s;t wi&s;hes accompli&s;hed, and looked forward to a long &s;eries of years, in which they hoped to reap the harve&s;t which &s;miled to them in pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>It might, indeed, have been rea&s;onably ex|pected, that thus victorious, crowned with public favour, with &s;o excellent a company as they then commanded, and with &s;uch brilliant future views, they had attained the &s;ummit of their de&s;ires, and that oppo&s;ition, &s;o completely foiled, mu&s;t cea&s;e her fruitle&s;s efforts, and entirely leave the field to &s;o powerful and re|&s;i&s;tle&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="17">
an enemy. Far different however were the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;hattered remains of the Smock-alley company were &s;till to be provided for: But without a leader nothing could po&s;&s;ibly be done. Various were the conferences held for the attainment of this object, innumerable were the projects formed, yet teeming with almo&s;t in&s;urmountable difficulties. However live they mu&s;t, and &s;ome mea&s;ure mu&s;t be adopted with &s;peed: Every eye &s;eemed turned upon Mr. Brown, as their la&s;t hope. Indeed, his known indolence of temper and extreme inat|tention to bu&s;ine&s;s, little qualified him for &s;uch a &s;tation as conductor of a Theatre; but his extraordinary abilities as an actor, the reputation he had &s;o ju&s;tly acquired with the town, joined to his knowledge of the &s;tage, overbalanced the&s;e defects, and &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to qua|lify him for this peculiarly arduous ta&s;k. On his part, his fortunes were de&s;perate. He had not any thing to lo&s;e, and might, if fortune &s;miled, reap &s;ome temporary advantage.</P>
<P>De&s;perate &s;ituations, require de&s;perate exer|tions, and what, at one time, prudence would
<PB N="4" REF="18">
condemn, at others, nece&s;&s;ity ju&s;tifies and &s;anc|tions. No &s;ooner therefore was this, almo&s;t hopele&s;s, project formed, than it was in&s;tantly embraced. Almo&s;t every performer in the theatre enli&s;ted under the banner of this new monarch, and promi&s;ed their utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. Brown then commenced his reign by entering into treaty with Mr. Sheridan, for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the forlorn and de&s;erted domains of Smock-alley, for the en&s;uing winter. Tho' there appeared &s;o little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, yet, as there was no other re&s;ource, Mr. Sheridan was contented to re&s;ign to him his dominions, with their every remaining appendage, upon very moderate conditions.</P>
<P>The principal object being thus accompli&s;h|ed, it was next re&s;olved to &s;pend the intervening time, previous to the winter &s;ea&s;on, at Cork and Limerick, where they might have lei&s;ure to meliorate their plan, and devi&s;e the be&s;t methods of carrying it into execution. Accordingly, the remainder of the company, except Mr. Digges, and Mrs. Ward, who returned to Edingburh, in in a &s;hort time after, repaired to Cork, where
<PB N="5" REF="19">
they continued to perform for &s;everal weeks, with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This unfore&s;een &s;torm, however, did not di&s;|courage the Crow-&s;treet managers; the oppo&s;i|tion wore an a&s;pect too feeble to create a &s;eri|ous alarm. Yet, however they might de&s;pi&s;e the impotence of the attack, like prudent generals, they provided again&s;t the next campaign, with &s;uch fore&s;ight, as left very little hopes for the mo&s;t &s;anguine friends of the oppo&s;ite party. Immediately on the clo&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, Mr. Sowdon &s;ailed for England and was quickly fol|lowed by Mr. Woodward and Mr. Barry, who ha&s;tened up to London, where they entered into treaty with every performer of eminence whom they had any chance of engaging.</P>
<P>Their company, in the mean time, repaired to their re&s;pective &s;ummer engagements, which chiefly lay at Che&s;ter, Manche&s;ter, Liverpool, and other principal tows contiguous to the Iri&s;h coa&s;ts; the&s;e performers were principally, Mr. and Mrs. Dancer, Mr. and Mrs. Jeffer&s;on, Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy, Mr. I&s;aac Sparks, Mr. Carmi|chael, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="20">Mr. King, to the great regret of his numerous admirers in this kingdon, returned to London, where he made his fir&s;t appearance at Drury-lane Theatre, in the October following, 1759, in Tom in the Con&s;cious Lovers.</P>
<P>The new managers, on their arrival in London, found little difficulty in their applications. The names of Barry and Woodward had great weight in their negociations: &s;ucce&s;s had e&s;tabli&s;hed their characters, and fame, the &s;ure attendant on victory, had prepared for them a mo&s;t flatter|ing reception.</P>
<P>The only per&s;on, who could materially oppo&s;e them, was, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op. He had been now ab|&s;ent upwards of two years from Ireland; his reputation, on leaving that kingdom, was equal to any actor's on the &s;tage, and the e&s;timation he at pre&s;ent &s;tood in with the London audience added highly to his character. 'Twas no ea&s;y ta&s;k to accommodate the bu&s;ine&s;s to his in|clinations, but he was too dangerous a rival to &s;tand on punctilio with.</P>
<P>Fortunately, they found him in a mood not altogether friendly to Mr. Garrick, and, con&s;e|quently,
<PB N="7" REF="21">
better di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to their propo|&s;als. Great and unrivalled as the Ro&s;cius was, yet was he not &s;uperior to the &s;tings of envy. The ri&s;ing fame of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op appeared to have excited in him &s;ome &s;uch &s;en&s;ation, and it was whil&s;t under this impre&s;&s;ion, that the Crow-&s;treet managers addre&s;&s;ed the former.</P>
<P>In an evil hour to him&s;elf did he yield to their &s;olicitations, and they had the addre&s;s quickly to &s;ettle every thing to his &s;atisfaction. He made his own terms, and the parts in Tragedy were to be divided between him and Mr. Barry in a very judicious manner.</P>
<P>Thus did a little pique urge him to a &s;tep he had ever after rea&s;on to repent, and plunge him into difficulties, di&s;tre&s;s, and poverty, which ended but with his life: whereas, had he remain|ed at Drury-lane, there could not have been a doubt but his extraordinary merit would &s;peedily have placed him above every competitor but Mr. Garrick, and crowned him with the fullne&s;s both of fortune and of fame.</P>
<P>This capital point gained, they next turned their thoughts towards Mr. Foote, who&s;e great fa&s;hion and popularity pointed him out as a very
<PB N="8" REF="22">
proper auxiliary at the commencement of the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. They engaged him for a certain number of nights, during which he was to per|form tho&s;e pieces of his own writing then in &s;uch reputation, and to bring out his Ta&s;te and Minor, neither of which had ever been exhibited in Ireland.</P>
<P>By the beginning of the following September the managers had nearly completed their recruit|ing bu&s;ine&s;s. Several other engagements, which the future pages will bring forward, were complet|ed, and on the 7th of the above month Mr. Wood|ward arrived in Dublin, with expectations, as &s;anguine, and as flattering, as the warme&s;t fancy could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e expectations were founded on rea|&s;on and probability, will be &s;een by a &s;light re|view of their recommendations. Their company was perhaps the &s;tronge&s;t, and be&s;t formed, of any hitherto beheld in Ireland. High in public favour, their credit e&s;tabli&s;hed, a new theatre, an excellent wardrobe, they had every advantage which could be derived from a combination of circum&s;tances &s;o fortunate. To crown the&s;e, and give animation to the whole, they were in
<PB N="9" REF="23">
a very eminent degree po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every influence which the court could give. Robert Wood, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> then ma&s;ter of the revels in this kingdom, ap|pointed Mr. Barry and Mr. Woodward his de|puties: by which act Crow-&s;treet became the theatre royal. Mr. Wood al&s;o conferred upon them the office of directors of his Maje&s;ty's band; a po&s;t indeed of more honour than profit: but their principal dependance lay on the new Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Dor&s;et. He was re|markably popular, and his countenance mu&s;t add uncommon weight to the party he e&s;pou&s;ed. In this re&s;pect they were not deceived. The Duke and Duche&s;s of Dor&s;et were peculiarly fond of the theatre, and honoured it with their pre&s;ence once or twice every week during the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus powerfully prepared, they took the field early in the &s;ea&s;on. Mr. Barry remained in London, to fini&s;h his bu&s;ine&s;s there, and to wait the lei&s;ure of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, who had agreed to accompany him on his return. Mr. Woodward, in the mean time, opened the theatre on Wedne&s;|day, October 3d 1759, with a new occa&s;ional prologue in the character of Rumour, written purpo&s;ely to defeat the oppo&s;ition formed again&s;t

<P>From the above &s;tatement I am led to make the following ob&s;ervations, though they are &s;omewhat premature:&mdash;So heavy and numerous a company had never before been collected for Dublin; the con&s;equences were obvious, the receipts of the theatre were not at that time nor, indeed, have they ever been &s;ince equal to the &s;upport of &s;o enormous an expence. The weekly payments to performers alone, often amounted to upwards of 170l. exclu&s;ive of trade&s;|mens bills, and &s;ervants &s;alaries which many times were not le&s;s than 200l. more. The Theatre had not then, nor perhaps ever will, attain in this kingdom a degree of opulence &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify &s;uch expenditures; the public cannot in rea&s;on expect it; and the manager, who thus launches out into &s;uch extravagance, will too late feel the con&s;equences of his imprudence. The pre&s;ent in&s;tance ju&s;tifies the&s;e reflections. At the end of one of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ea&s;ons ever then known, Mr. Barry and Mr. Woodward
<PB N="13" REF="27">
found them&s;elves greatly deficient, a deficiency which every year increa&s;ed, till in the end it involved them in total ruin.</P>
<P>But to return. Every thing &s;eemed to wear a propitious a&s;pect with the new Theatre-royal Crow &s;treet. The town was highly plea&s;ed with the hou&s;e, company, and the performances. So many difficulties had Mr. Brown to &s;truggle with that his mo&s;t zealous partizans could en|tertain but little hopes of his being able to open Smock-alley. Almo&s;t every night produced &s;ome novelty at Crow-&s;treet, and the &s;everal exhibi|tions were in general well attended. A Signior Lucca Fabiano, a dancer, made his fir&s;t appear|ance after the Beggars Opera, early in the &s;ea|&s;on: his abilities were of the moderate kind, and could not be put in competition with Mr. Ald|ridge, then beginning to be a great favourite, and who, in one particular &s;tile of dancing, was &s;uperior to any man in Europe.</P>
<P>A few nights after two young ladies made their debut in the comedy of Love makes a man. A Mi&s;s Ro&s;co in the part of Narci&s;&s;a, and a Mi&s;s O&s;borne in that of Amanda, and both were received with a moderate &s;hare of applau&s;e.
<PB N="14" REF="28">
Mi&s;s Ro&s;co was the daughter of an actor of that name, of &s;ome eminence in the theatic world. This young lady had many claims on the pub|lic. Her figure and features, tho' full, and rather ma&s;culine, were well adapted to the &s;tage&mdash;&s;he had &s;pirit, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed plea&s;ing mu&s;ical powers. Her forte lay principally in lively comedy, and &s;inging characters, &s;uch as Lucy in the Beggars Opera. She remained &s;everal years in this king|dom e&s;teemed and re&s;pected; at length, being rather di&s;gu&s;ted at the &s;ituation in which &s;he was, &s;he re&s;olved to try another. Having received an excellent education, and being mi&s;tre&s;s of many elegant accompli&s;hments, &s;he quitted the &s;tage, and returned to Bath, where &s;he opened a board|ing &s;chool for young ladies, which &s;he conducted with the highe&s;t reputation and greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. Mi&s;s O&s;borne was of a re&s;pectable Engli&s;h family; the misfortunes and death of her father, obliged her mother to retire with this, her only daughter to Dublin, where &s;he lived with prudence and oeconomy. If fame is to be credited, the &s;ame chance which gave the abilities of Mrs. Oldfield to the world, di&s;covered tho&s;e of Mi&s;s O&s;borne. A gentleman of much theatrical know|ledge, by accident one day overheard her reading the play of Venice Pre&s;erved to her mother;
<PB N="15" REF="29">
&s;truck with the propriety and elegance of her manner, he a few days, after mentioned this cir|cum&s;tance to Mr. Barry, who was his particu|lar friend, in &s;o warm a manner, that Mr. Barry, in con&s;equence of his reque&s;t, vi&s;ited the young lady, and from a few &s;pecimens which he pre|vailed on her timidity to give, found his friend had not exagerated in his report of her abilities. The conclu&s;ion was, after &s;ome intreaty he pre|vailed on the mother to con&s;ent to Mi&s;s O&s;borne's going on the &s;tage, where &s;he remained many years, and though her talents were not of the fir&s;t rate, yet &s;he &s;u&s;tained many &s;econd parts in tragedy and comedy with reputation, whil&s;t her character in private rendered her an orna|ment to her profe&s;&s;ion. In proce&s;s of time we &s;hall find this young lady married to Mr. W. Barry, trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>To give every public &s;anction to the theatre, the Duke and Duche&s;s of Dor&s;et commanded a play &s;o early in the &s;ea&s;on as Saturday October 13th 1759, when the comedy of the Stratagem was performed&mdash;in which Mr. Woodward played Scrub, Mr. Dexter Archer, and Mrs. Dancer Mrs. Sullen; with the ballad farce of the Contrivances, then in great e&s;timation; Rove|well
<PB N="16" REF="30">
Mr. Vernon, and Arethu&s;a, Mrs. Chambers. Every preparation was made to receive the&s;e illu&s;trious gue&s;ts, the hou&s;e was uncommonly brilliant and crowded, and &s;o highly plea&s;ed were their Graces with their entertainment, that every Saturday, and &s;ometimes oftner, during the re|mainder of the &s;ea&s;on, did they honour the theatre with their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Much about this time, a young Gentleman was announced for the character of Lord Townly, be|ing his fir&s;t appearance on any &s;tage. Curio&s;ity prompted many to &s;ee this young adventurer, who on trial acquitted him&s;elf with great credit, and gave early promi&s;e of proving a powerful &s;upport to the drama. His next appearance was in George Barnwell, when he confirmed the fa|vourable hopes conceived of him.</P>
<P>The latter end of October Mr. Barry arrived with Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, who&s;e appearance was imme|diately adverti&s;ed for Wedne&s;day the 31&s;t, in his favourite character of Zanga, a part, in which he certainly out&s;tript every competitor and truly merited the admiration of the dramatic world. At an early hour the hou&s;e was filled, and the rei|terated plaudits which accompanied his entrance
<PB N="17" REF="31">
&s;poke the genuine feelings of the public at the re|turn of one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of the Iri&s;h &s;tage, and at the &s;ame time convinced the mana|gers that they had procured a mo&s;t valuable ac|qui&s;ition to their community.</P>
<P>But &s;hort are our views, and erroneous too often our be&s;t concerted projects, oft do we gra&s;p with eagerne&s;s and avidity at objects which when attained, prove the &s;ource of endle&s;s evils! Even &s;o was it in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Could Mr. Barry and Mr. Woodward have fore&s;een but a part of the con&s;equences which flowed from their engage|ment of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, or the numberle&s;s train of calamities which for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years they were to experience, they would have &s;ubmitted to the greate&s;t temporary lo&s;s or di&s;&s;appointment, rather than invite over, a man who alone, in a very &s;hort time, was capable of di&s;puting their title to the dramatic &s;overeingty of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's &s;econd character was Richard, his third Macbeth, in which Mrs. Fitzhenry made her fir&s;t appearance that &s;ea&s;on. In a few days after, Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure, which was revived for the purpo&s;e, was brought forward and mo&s;t capitally &s;upported throughout, e&s;pecially by Mr.
<PB N="18" REF="32">
Mo&s;&s;op in the Duke, Mr. Woodward in Lucio, and Mrs Fitzhenry in I&s;abella. The reputation this comedy then acquired, &s;upported it for many years, and it was often repeated, even after &s;everal of its principal &s;upporters were di&s;u|nited.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry judiciou&s;ly re&s;erved him&s;elf till the &s;ea&s;on was &s;omewhat more advanced, and the novelty of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ub&s;ided. On Saturday, November 17th he came out with the utmo&s;t force and eclat in Ore&s;tes, in the Di&s;tre&s;t Mother; Pyrrhus, Mr. Sowdon; Andromache, Mrs. Dancer; and Her|mione, Mrs. Fitzhenry. The play was command|ed by the Lord Lieutenant. The characters were new dre&s;&s;ed. No expence was &s;pared, and every circum&s;tance concurred to render the hou&s;e uncommonly fa&s;hionable and brilliant.</P>
<P>Early in December Mr. Foote was brought forward in the comedy of the Old Batchelor, which was got up on purpo&s;e for his Fondlewife, after which was pre&s;ented his farce of the Knights. Amid&s;t &s;uch a group of capital objects, Mr. Foote had not much rea&s;on to boa&s;t of his attraction; however his engagement an&s;wered the manager's
<PB N="19" REF="33">
purpo&s;e: he played upon &s;hares and filled up the vacant nights. In the cour&s;e of a few weeks, he appeared in Sir Paul Plyant, Double Dealer, Shylock, be&s;ides often repeating his farces of the Knights, Ta&s;te, the Author, and the Engli&s;hman returned from Paris. His Minor, from which great expectations were formed, failed very much, and was not repeated. Its &s;ucce&s;s afterwards in Lon|don gave it a currency, it otherwi&s;e never would have obtained.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote's benefit was on the 11th, of Febru|ary, &s;oon after which he returned to England, not much plea&s;ed with his expedition either as to fame or profit. The latter did not by any means an&s;wer; and he had the mortification to leave his pupil, Mr. Wilkin&s;on, at the other hou&s;e in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, and ri&s;ing every day in the very line he &s;o much excelled in, mimickry; even &s;o much as to be acknowledged at lea&s;t equal, if not &s;uperior, to his preceptor.</P>
<P>Much about this time, the comedy of the Lon|don Cuckolds was performed with &s;uch &s;trength, as to render it popular enough to draw &s;everal hou&s;es. Thank heaven! the ta&s;te of the times has &s;ince undergone a material change. Were &s;uch a
<PB N="20" REF="34">
licentious piece to be now pre&s;ented to the pub|lic, they would reject it with the indignation it &s;o highly merits.</P>
<P>The &s;tage &s;hould never be made the vehicle of immorality or vice; its intere&s;ts &s;hould ever be &s;ub&s;ervient to the cau&s;e of religion and virtue. As long as this golden rule is ob&s;erved, &s;o long will the drama flouri&s;h, and be cheri&s;hed by the wi&s;e and good.</P>
<P>Here I cannot help ob&s;erving, that a ju&s;t and refined ta&s;te in the public will ever have its due influence on the theatre. Was that ta&s;te more univer&s;al, the manager and actor from inclination and intere&s;t would more &s;trictly conform to it&mdash; neither in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would introduce or per|form what could not &s;tand the te&s;t of truth and rea&s;on&mdash;&s;uch as the audience are&mdash;&s;uch always will be the actor.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance happened about this time which de&s;erves notice. At this period the arms of Great Britain were uncommonly &s;ucce&s;sful by &s;ea and land in every quarter of the globe. Among&s;t her victorious &s;ons, Admiral Saunders eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf; by accident the
<PB N="21" REF="35">
&s;hip he commanded put into Cork where he land|ed and immediately proceeded to Dublin&mdash;on his arrival in the evening he found that the Lord Lieu|tenant, to whom he intended to pay his re&s;pects, was at the play with the Duche&s;s, upon which he ha&s;tened to the theatre where he was introduc|ed to them&mdash;the moment the audience were in|formed who he was, they &s;tood up and gave him three huzzas! and the managers, when the play was concluded &s;ent on Mr. Vernon, dre&s;t in cha|racter, attended by every vocal performer in the hou&s;e, to &s;ing Rule Brittania; &s;o unexpected a compliment produced an effect not to be di&s;|cribed. Every &s;pectator joined in chorus, and the hou&s;e re&s;ounded with acclamations.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Smock-alley Company delineated&mdash;Mr. Brown, Ry|der, Stayley, Hur&s;t, Heatton, Waker, Mrs. Ibbot, the two Mi&s;s Philips's, and Mrs. Abing|ton&mdash;They open&mdash;Mr. Wilkin&s;on arrives&mdash;his &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;High life below Stairs performed with great applau&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT all this while, the reader may perhaps imagine, that I have entirely forgot the Smock-alley theatre&mdash;not &s;o&mdash;innumerable were the dif|ficulties Mr. Brown, and the performers under his management, had to &s;truggle with&mdash;poverty, want of numbers, want of credit, a de&s;erted, ru|inous theatre contra&s;ted to every advantage which power, &s;ucce&s;s, &s;trength of forces, univer&s;al favour, and full coffers could confer.</P>
<P>However, all that could be done by people in &s;uch circum&s;tances was performed. Mr. Brown's abilities I have formerly mentioned. He had an ea&s;e, a manner, and addre&s;s which few could ever attain. His Copper Captain was allowed to be &s;uperior to Woodward's&mdash;his Benedict at lea&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="37">
equal&mdash;Mr. Ryder, who&s;e merit, even at this early period, was univer&s;ally acknowledged, proved of infinite &s;ervice to the cau&s;e. As few ever de&s;erv|ed public favour more, &s;o have none enjoyed it longer than this excellent comedian. Mr. George Stayley, an actor of &s;ome ability and noticed as an author, joined the &s;tandard, Mr. Hur&s;t, an actor of re&s;pectability and merit, Mr. Heatton, Mr. Waker, &s;ince well known to the Dublin audience, Mr. John&s;ton, Mr. Adcock, Mr. Mahon formed the principal part of the male performers.</P>
<P>The ladies were, Mrs. Ibbot, who though far from being a good figure, was an excellent actre&s;s, and a remarkably good &s;peaker; &s;he played many characters in tragedy much above mediocrity, but in Mrs. Heidelberg, Lady Wrangle, Mrs. Oakly, and parts in that line, &s;he was &s;uperior to any I have ever &s;een. The two Mi&s;s Phillips's, Mi&s;s Willis, Mrs. Adcock, Mrs. John&s;on, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that three &s;i&s;ters &s;hould have been equally &s;mitten with a love for the drama, and have devoted their abilities to the &s;ervice of the theatre. The three Mi&s;s Phillips's were of a genteel family in England, and had received a fini&s;hed and accompli&s;hed education.
<PB N="24" REF="38">
While young, they went upon the &s;tage, and &s;up|ported each of them a very principal and extended line of bu&s;ine&s;s, both in tragedy and comedy, for many years. The elde&s;t died, unmarried, at York, where &s;he had re&s;ided for &s;ome time, la|mented, and beloved. Of the other two, one was married to Mr. U&s;her: the other, became a Mrs. Frances, and, what has principally di&s;tingui&s;hed her, was mother to the now &s;o celebrated Mrs. Jordan.</P>
<P>From circum&s;tances the lea&s;t expected, fre|quently ari&s;e events the mo&s;t &s;plendid. The di&s;agreeable predicament in which Mr. Brown was placed, proved the means of introducing to the world, talents, which have &s;ince excited its con&s;tant admiration. I mean no le&s;s than tho&s;e of the famous Mrs. Abington. This lady was at that time very young. We are told by Mr. Wil|kin&s;on in his Memoirs, that "She had played a few parts at Bath, when Mr. Brown was mana|ger; al&s;o, at Richmond, and in a few chance plays, with Theophilus Cibber, in the Hay|market." And though &s;he had at every opportuni|ty, given &s;pecimens of tho&s;e comic powers, which were afterwards &s;o amply di&s;played, yet it could &s;carcely have been &s;uppo&s;ed, that in &s;o &s;hort a
<PB N="25" REF="39">
time, &s;he would have been acknowledged the fir&s;t comic actre&s;s on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Mrs. Abington had been at Drury Lane with Mr. Garrick: but judging from every appear|ance, that at that time, &s;he could not have in London, &s;o favourable a field for the di&s;play of her abilities as Dublin pre&s;ented, &s;he li&s;tened to the propo&s;als of Mr. Brown, who was then in town on the recruiting &s;ervice. He entertained the highe&s;t opinion of her merit, and promi&s;ed her every leading character &s;he could wi&s;h. His offers were accepted: accompanied by her hu&s;|band, &s;he embarked for Ireland, where &s;he ar|rived early in December.</P>
<P>Mr. Brown, having u&s;ed every exertion po&s;&s;ible in London, returned to Dublin the latter end of November. Having repaired, and decorated Smock Alley, as far as his &s;lender finances would admit, and made every nece&s;&s;ary preparation, he opened on Friday, the 11th of December, 1759, with the comedy of the Stratagem, in which he performed Archer; Mr. Waker, Scrub, and Mrs. Abington, Mrs. Sullen; being her fir&s;t appearance on the Iri&s;h &s;tage. On this occa&s;ion, Mr. Brown &s;poke a prologue, written by him&s;elf,
<PB N="26" REF="40">
entreating the favour and protection of the town.</P>
<P>Every effort which could be u&s;ed, was tried, to procure a re&s;pectable audience for the fir&s;t night, and the curio&s;ity generally prevalent on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, induced many to vi&s;it their long-favoured &s;cene of amu&s;ement. The company was alto|gether tolerably liked, and hope animated their endeavours. Their next e&s;&s;ay was on the Wed|ne&s;day following, when Mr. Brown appeared in his favourite Benedict, which with Mrs. Abington's Beatrice, were as truly capital pieces of acting, as ever were pre&s;ented to the public.</P>
<P>As Mr. Brown was acknowledged to be equal to any comedian living in &s;uch characters&mdash;as Bra&s;s in the Confederacy, Bayes in the Rehear|&s;al, Ranger in the Su&s;picious Hu&s;band, Sir John Brute, Felix, Roebuck, Marplot, Dr. Wolf in the Non Juror, Don John in the Chances, Mon|&s;ieur Le Medecin, Lord Chalk&s;tone, A&s;pin, Abel Drugger; &s;o did Mrs. Abington &s;urpa&s;s the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations in Corinna, Clarinda, Flora and Violante, Lady Fanciful, Leanthe, Maria in the Non Juror, Second Con&s;tantia, Fine Lady in Lethe, &amp;c.

&s;he added to her reputation, and before the &s;ea&s;on clo&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding every di&s;ad|vantage, and many there were, particularly that of not having received the London &s;tamp of fa|&s;hion and approbation, &s;he was con&s;idered as one of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t promi&s;ing actre&s;&s;es on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>To this embarra&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the Smock Alley company, fortune rai&s;ed an unexpected relief. This was the arrival of Mr. Wilkin&s;on in Ire|land, and his almo&s;t immediate engagement with Mr. Brown. This gentleman in his memoirs, which contain an infinite deal of dramatic infor|mation, and are well worthy the peru&s;al of every lover of the Theatre, relates the incidents of this campaign, with &s;o much accuracy and fidelity, that he has left little for me to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only therefore ob&s;erve, that Mr. Wil|kin&s;on was a very &s;ea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary rein|forcement. He had great connections in Dublin, and general opinion gave him the preference to Mr. Foote. His terms were, &s;hares above twenty pounds, and a clear benefit. The former proved of little emolument; the latter, highly produc|tive. He appeared on Friday, January 4th,
<PB N="28" REF="42">
1760, after the comedy of Much ado about Nothing, in a piece of Mr Foote's, never at that time acted in Ireland, called the Diver&s;ions of the Morning. He was well &s;upported, and re|ceived much applau&s;e. His imitation of his late friend Mr. Foote, was highly reli&s;hed, and he re|peated it on the Monday following, after Browne's Shylock, and Mrs. Abington's Portia, to about forty pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkin&s;on during his &s;tay, repeatedly acted King Lear, Zampti in the Orphan of China, Mrs. Amlet in the Confederacy, Lord Chalk-&s;tone and Cadwallader: Mrs. Abington Becky. His benefit was fixed for Friday, February 15th, Douglas, and for the fir&s;t time in this kingdom, the farce of High Life below Stairs, when, not|with&s;tanding a very deep &s;now &s;torm, Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure performed at Crow Street, with Mo&s;&s;op, Woodward and Fitzhenry, with the pantomime of Fortunatus, which drew one hun|dred and twenty pounds, and a concert for the benefit of a Mi&s;s M'Neale, yet, &s;o great was his intere&s;t, there was an overflow from every part, and the amount of the receipts was one hundred and &s;eventy-two pounds, the greate&s;t then &s;aid to have been ever known in that Theatre. A &s;e|cond night was demanded for his out&s;tanding
<PB N="29" REF="43">
tickets, and on Thur&s;day, February 21&s;t, to the Orphan of China and High Life, there was one hundred and fifty pounds. Mr. Wilkin&s;on re|turned to London early in March 1750, much &s;atisfied with his expedition.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t notice, the extraordinary &s;uc|ce&s;s of the farce of High Life below Stairs. It would exceed the limits pre&s;cribed to this work, to copy at full length, the circum&s;tances attend|ing this piece, which Mr. Wilkin&s;on &s;o agreea|bly de&s;cribes: &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that this plea&s;ing farce had e&s;caped the notice of the Crow Street managers. In the multiplicity of their bu&s;ine&s;s, engro&s;&s;ed as they were, in the preparation of grand tragedies and pantomimes, they probably might not have thought it worthy of their atten|tion. Mr. Wilkin&s;on luckily fixed upon it. He communicated his intentions to Mrs. Abington, who not only approved of his choice, but con|&s;ented to play the part of Kitty. The piece had been brought out at Drury Lane, &s;o early as the month of October, where it had met with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. They had both frequently &s;een it before they left London, and were therefore quite perfect in the &s;tage bu&s;ine&s;s proper to it. It lay within the compa&s;s of the company; could be
<PB N="30" REF="44">
got up at very little expence, and no compari&s;on could be drawn to their di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkin&s;on tells us&mdash;<Q>Mr. Ryder's Sir Harry was a very excellent piece of acting, and helped the piece materially. A Mr. Gates, a very conceited actor, played Lord Duke. His faults and oddities &s;erved but to heighten the extra|vagance of the character. Mr. Heatton's Philip, was as well as &s;uch a part could be. He was a very good actor in all the dry clowns, Clod|poles, &amp;c. Mi&s;s Philips (aunt to the pre&s;ent Mrs. Jordan) our heroine, who was al&s;o of a conceited-turn, though &s;en&s;ible and well edu|cated, made the part of Lady Bab better than any other actre&s;s I ever &s;aw attempt it; my&s;elf from ob&s;ervation and youth mu&s;t have been &s;tupid, not to have made a very good Jemmy, the Country Boy, and, as the great per&s;onage always appears la&s;t in triumphal entries and proce&s;&s;ions; &s;o in Mrs. Kitty, Mrs. Abington advanced. The whole circle were in &s;urpri&s;e and rapture, each a&s;king the other how &s;uch a trea&s;ure could have po&s;&s;ibly been in Dublin, and almo&s;t in a &s;tate of ob&s;curity; &s;uch a jewel was invaluable, and their own ta&s;tes and judg|ments they feared, would ju&s;tly be called in que&s;tion, if this daughter of Thalia was not
<PB N="31" REF="45">
immediately taken by the hand, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as her certain and &s;triking merit de|manded.</Q> To this I &s;hall only add, that &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful were they in their repre&s;entation of this farce, that it was repeated upwards of a do|zen times, during the remaining part of the &s;ea|&s;on.</P>
<P>Little more remains to be &s;aid of the Smock Alley company, for the pre&s;ent. Notwith&s;tanding the great merit of the &s;everal performers I have mentioned, yet the conte&s;t was too unequal to be maintained with any degree of probable &s;uc|ce&s;s. Mr. Brown varied the bill of fare as much as po&s;&s;ible. He appeared alternately in Benedict, Richard, Captain Macheath, Copper Captain, Old Norval, Roman Father, &amp;c. Though he di&s;played much merit in each, and was in &s;everal aided by the ri&s;ing favourite Mrs. Abington; though Mr. Ryder was allowed to be a promi&s;ing and favourite actor, though Mr. Hur&s;t, Mr. Heatton, Mr. Stayley, Mi&s;s Philips, Mrs. Ibbot, and &s;everal others, had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves, yet &s;till all was ineffectual. The re|ceipts in common were from 15 <HI>l.</HI> to 40 <HI>l.</HI> many had good benefits, particularly Mrs. Abington, who had got up the play of A New Way to Pay
<PB N="32" REF="46">
Old Debts, and who grew then &s;o much the fa&s;hion, that her hou&s;e was crowded and bril|liant.</P>
<P>Mr. Brown, at length, clo&s;ed a di&s;agreeable campaign, early in May 1760, heartily tired of his &s;ituation; his finances certainly could not be much more deranged than they were at the commencement, for he had nothing to lo&s;e at the beginning: it is true, there was an accumu|lation of debts, which perhaps, have never &s;ince been di&s;charged, and the re&s;t of the per|formers mu&s;t have &s;uffered materially in their circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e for the pre&s;ent, my account of the Smock Alley Theatre, with the following bill of one of their be&s;t and mo&s;t attracting comedies, which may afford &s;ome in&s;ight into the &s;tate of their performances.</P>

<P><PB N="34" REF="48">Let us now return to the victorious party. Hitherto each event had an&s;wered to their utmo&s;t wi&s;h; the theatre was in the highe&s;t reque&s;t, and well attended. Indeed, in ju&s;tice to the managers, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that they were truly de&s;erving of public favour. They &s;pared neither pains nor expence, in preparing their pieces for repre&s;entation; on the contrary, their profu&s;ion was their only fault. They launched into expences, which the receipts of a Dublin theatre have hitherto never been able to repay; expences which, in the end, mu&s;t, even with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, involve every manager who adopts them, in inevitable ruin.</P>
<P>The tragedies of Crow-&s;treet, were got up in a &s;tile of &s;uperior &s;plendour. The expence of the mere guards in Coriolanus, amounted to 3<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> per night. The guards and chorus &s;ingers in Alexander, to 8<HI>l.</HI> The acting of the trage|dies was fir&s;t rate. The force of the Two Heroes of the Bu&s;kin, was aided by the power|ful attractions of Mrs. Dancer and Mrs. Fitz|henry. A &s;pecimen or two will &s;hew the &s;trength of their repre&s;entations, as Othello, Mr. Barry, Roderigo, Mr. Woodward, Ca&s;&s;io, Mr. Dexter, Brabantio, Mr. Walker, Iago, Mr.
<PB N="35" REF="49">

The&s;e with Mr. Woodward's excellent pantomimes, where neither pains or expence were &s;pared, were de|&s;erving of every favour and encouragement.</P>
<P>There never were, perhaps, two tragedians, of &s;uch uncommon excellence, who&s;e abilities &s;o well accorded, and who&s;e re&s;pective lines of acting, &s;o little interfered, as tho&s;e of Barry and of Mo&s;&s;op. Nature had, indeed been pe|culiarly bountiful to both, and had gifted them with a liberal hand. But in the di&s;tribution of her favours, &s;he would appear to have promoted union, by diver&s;ity. The talents of each, though great, were &s;o di&s;tinct, their qualifications &s;o oppo&s;ed, as to preclude the probability of di&s;|putes ari&s;ing from immediate competition. Their performances, formed an almo&s;t total contra&s;t, the one to the other; hence, it would be natural to imagine, that tho&s;e theatrical de|mons,
<PB N="36" REF="50">
envy and di&s;cord, &s;hould have been for ever excluded from their intercour&s;e. Happy would it have been for them&s;elves, happy for a numerous lift of performers, who were after|wards attached to their fortunes, if &s;uch had been the ca&s;e. Truth obliges me to confe&s;s, it was the very rever&s;e. The real motives which originated the coolne&s;s between Mr. Barry and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, I am not able, at this di&s;tance of time, to a&s;certain, but the effects were vi&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>The fame of Mrs. Abington &s;till increa&s;ing, &s;he became an object for the Crow-&s;treet ma|nagers to fix their attention upon; many per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank earne&s;tly intere&s;ted them&s;elves in her favour, and wi&s;hed much to &s;ee their new favourite tran&s;planted to the genial &s;un|&s;hine of the royal theatre before the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on; and they exerted them&s;elves &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, that an engagement was &s;oon con|cluded. She was to perform a few nights for a clear benefit.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of Mrs. Abington at Crow-&s;treet theatre was on the 22d of May, 1760, in the character of lady Townly, and
<PB N="37" REF="51">
Lucinda in the Engli&s;hman in Paris, being the night appointed for her benefit; and, &s;o gener|ally was &s;he patronized, that part of the pit was laid into the boxes, and there was a great over|flow from every part of the hou&s;e. So rapidly did this charming actre&s;s ri&s;e, and &s;o highly was &s;he e&s;teemed by the public: even &s;o early did &s;he di&s;cover a ta&s;te in dre&s;s and a talent to lead the ton, that &s;everal of the ladies mo&s;t fa&s;hion|able ornaments were di&s;tingui&s;hed by her name, and the Abington cap was the prevailing rage of the day.</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on advanced, it began to be ru|moured, that a new and more vigorous oppo&s;i|tion was intended. This at fir&s;t was di&s;regarded, as an idle report; but every day added to its cer|tainty. The latter end of April put it pa&s;t all doubt. On the managers r&eacute;que&s;ting Mr. Mo&s;&s;op to renew his articles, he frankly replied, he de&s;igned to open Smock-alley theatre the en&s;uing winter. This unfore&s;een &s;troke they were not of cour&s;e prepared to encounter. They had now a new, and much more powerful, rival to contend with; their vi&s;ionary hopes of having overcome all ob&s;tacles, were by this declaration at an end, and they had their work to begin anew. How|ever,
<PB N="38" REF="52">
remon&s;trances were fruitle&s;s. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op was offered terms even beyond their utmo&s;t ability to fulfil. The&s;e he haughtily rejected. Nothing therefore but uncommon exertions could guard again&s;t &s;o formidable an attack, and they now &s;aw, in its fulle&s;t extent, their error in bringing over &s;o great and dangerous a favourite.</P>
<P>Every &s;trength being thus required, a very eligible engagement was offered by them to Mrs. Abington, which &s;he thought it proper to ac|cept; rightly judging that her abilities would receive greater &s;upport, and have better oppor|tunities of di&s;play with Woodward, than with Mo&s;&s;op. It was, indeed, no ea&s;y ta&s;k to adju&s;t the di&s;tribution of characters between her and Mrs. Dancer, who then was eminent as well in comedy as in tragedy. However, it was agreed, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, to divide them with impartiality.</P>
<P>On Monday, June the 9th, 1760, the Crow-&s;treet theatre clo&s;ed one of the mo&s;t brilliant and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ea&s;ons ever known in Ireland, with the tragedy of Oroonoko. Oroonoko, Mr. Barry, Imo|inda, Mrs. Dancer, and the Virgin Unma&s;ked of Mr. Abington. Mr. Woodward, immediately
<PB N="39" REF="53">
afterwards, &s;et off for London, to endeavour to repair his lo&s;&s;es and provide for the next cam|paign. He was followed, in a few weeks, by Mr. Mo&s;&s;op on &s;imilar bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry, in the mean time, led his conquer|ing troops to Cork, where a new and beautiful theatre had been built in George's-&s;treet, on the model of Crow-&s;treet, capable of containing an hundred and fifty pounds.</P>
<P>It may here, not be ami&s;s to mention, that as this work is de&s;igned as an hi&s;tory of the Iri&s;h &s;tage, I hope it will not be deemed, deviating from the general plan, to devote occa&s;ionally a few pages to the dramatic occurrences of the &s;econd city in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Cork has, from the earlie&s;t accounts, been u&s;ed to have theatrical performances exhibited in a degree of perfection that has rendered the audience remarkably good judges. The rea&s;on is evident. The theatre was &s;eldom opened but in &s;ummer, when the be&s;t of the Dublin com|pany u&s;ed to be &s;elected, with the addition of &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital performers from
<PB N="40" REF="54">
London. Before 1736, there never had been a regular theatre built.</P>
<P>In that year, they opened one tolerably com|modious, where the pre&s;ent Bu&s;h Tavern &s;tands in George's-&s;treet.</P>
<P>As Barry and Woodward had formed the mo&s;t exten&s;ive de&s;igns, &s;o opulent a city as Cork, could not e&s;cape their notice. They purcha&s;ed a piece of ground in George's-&s;treet, and opened a &s;ub&s;cription of fifty pounds each, for building a new theatre. The &s;ub&s;cription &s;oon filled, as the &s;ub&s;cribers were each entitled to transferable tickets of admittance to every performance without exception. The theatre opened with an occa&s;ional prologue in July 1760. The company was, perhaps, the be&s;t ever then &s;een in the city: the natural con&s;equence was, that the &s;ucce&s;s was equal to the excellence of the performers, and there was a continuation of the fulle&s;t hou&s;es ever known. What in &s;ome mea&s;ure contributed to this was the war, which at that time brought numbers of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war to Cove. Sailors have always been remarked as fond of a theatre, and as they earn their money harder than any other de&s;cription of people in the
<PB N="41" REF="55">
world, &s;o do they &s;pend it more freely. A mi&s;erly &s;eaman is a prodigy.</P>
<P>There happened, however, an event, at the opening of the Cork theatre at this time, worthy of noticeing. The mayor of Cork had always been accu&s;tomed, when the company came to town, to be waited on by the manager, for his permi&s;&s;ion to perform. This, though a mere ceremony, as leave never was refu&s;ed, Mr. Barry did not chu&s;e to comply with. The mayor, willing to pre&s;erve the etiquette, declar|ed he would not grant his licence. Mr. Barry informed him, he did not &s;tand in need of his protection, as he could open his theatre with|out. The matter growing &s;erious, friends inter|po&s;ed, and Mr. Barry, to put an end to it, pro|duced the king's patent, granting to Mr. Wood, and his deputies, the office of ma&s;ter of the revels in the kingdom of Ireland, with liberty to open one or more theatres in Dublin, or any other place they &s;hould choo&s;e. After this, he &s;hewed the deputation granted to Mr. Wood|ward and him&s;elf, and to further &s;atisfy the Mayor, he laid copies of both before the city council, who acknowledged their validity, and the Mayor forbore any further oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="56">Mr. Woodward remained but a &s;hort time in London, and having in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible, &s;ettled his affairs, then &s;et off for Cork, where the company remained 'till the latter end of September, when each party prepared to take the field.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHETHER the intere&s;ts of the dramatic world, and of the public in general, are be&s;t &s;erved by a &s;ingle Theatre, or by a plurality, has been matter of frequent di&s;pute. As on every &s;peculative point, &s;o on this, advocates are to be found for each &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Nor are arguments, re&s;pectively, wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="58">By &s;ome it is &s;aid, that the exclu&s;ive e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a &s;ingle Theatre, under proper re|gulations, is &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the entertain|ment of the public; whil&s;t it precludes the di&s;traction and di&s;tre&s;s, naturally incident to contending parties. Others, on the contrary, declaim again&s;t it, as again&s;t all monopolies; as partial and unju&s;t, as fettering the will of the people, and depriving them of that freedom of choice, which is their natural right.</P>
<P>Without entering into the merits of this que&s;tion, a matter foreign to the purpo&s;e of this work, let it &s;uffice, to &s;tate facts, as they have been. Thus much has been extracted, by a contemplation of the oppo&s;ition, upon the hi&s;|tory of which we are now entering. It will ex|hibit to us, as in the ca&s;e of all parties, many mi&s;chiefs, and many exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As the period for the commencement of ope|rations approached, all was expectation. Vari|ous were the reports in circulation; and curio&s;i|ty was eager for an examination, and compari&s;on of the two companies. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op returned at the latter end of September. Smock-alley underwent a thorough repair, which, indeed, it
<PB N="45" REF="59">
e&s;&s;entially wanted. An entirely new &s;et of &s;cenes were painted, by Edwards, and a tolera|ble new wardrobe was collected.</P>
<P>Crow-&s;treet Theatre was al&s;o new painted and decorated, and every thing being prepared, they took the lead, and opened on Friday October 24th 1760; with a new occa&s;ional prologue, written and &s;poken by Mr. Woodward, who, with great &s;pirit, affected to make light of the difficulties they had to encounter: Repeating tho&s;e lines of Hot&s;pur's,
<Q><L>Harry to Harry &s;hall, and hor&s;e to hor&s;e,</L>
<L>Meet and n'eer part, 'till one drop down of cour&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t night, at Crow-&s;treet, produced no novelty; it was purpo&s;ely cho&s;en for its title, All's Well that End's Well, Captain Parolles Mr. Woodward, Helena Mrs. Dancer, with the Lying Valet. The hou&s;e was far from being crowded; on this occa&s;ion, no judgment could be formed.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op had now, to all appearance, a fair claim to &s;ucce&s;s. With much diligence, he had collected a very excellent company. He
<PB N="46" REF="60">
was univer&s;ally admired as an actor, and had a powerful intere&s;t among&s;t per&s;ons of rank. The Counte&s;s of Brandon, and many leading ladies, were much attached to his cau&s;e; he had, in|dependant of his own great merit, every charm which novelty of management and performers could give. The comedy of the Old Batchelor was the play fixed on and adverti&s;ed, when, be|hold! on the very morning announced for his opening, a &s;olemn, and unfore&s;een event put an entire &s;top to his career for the pre&s;ent, and overca&s;t by its gloom, the immediate brightne&s;s of his pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day morning October 29th 1760, news arrived of the decea&s;e of his maje&s;ty King George the &s;econd. This melancholy circum|&s;tance, cau&s;ed the theatre to be immediately &s;hut: it was a &s;evere &s;troke to both parties, but particu|larly unlucky to the new levies of Smock-alley, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be overburthened with ca&s;h, to &s;u&s;tain this additional delay. In this &s;ituation, patience was their only remedy. For|tunately, the goodne&s;s and con&s;ideration of government, di&s;played it&s;elf on this occa&s;ion. It &s;hortened, by much, the u&s;ual time of mourn|ing, a&s;&s;ured, that the grief implanted in the
<PB N="47" REF="61">
heart of every &s;ubject, needed not this outward di&s;play of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the limited time expired, both parties commenced their operations, with re|doubled vigour. Crow-&s;treet, which continued to be the royal theatre, opened with the Bu&s;y Body, on Monday 17th November, Marplot, Woodward, Miranda, Dancer, and Intriguing Chambermaid, in neither of which any new Faces appeared. Smock-alley re&s;umed the Old Batchelor, when that genuine &s;on of comic hu|mour, We&s;ton made his fir&s;t appearance in the character of Fondlewife; and was received with much, and de&s;erved applau&s;e. This actor who&s;e naivet&eacute;, and peculiar &s;tile of playing has not &s;ince been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, remained in Dublin the whole of the &s;ea&s;on; and though he had not then attained the eminence, which afterwards he &s;o ju&s;tly acquired, yet he was received with great plea&s;ure, in the Lying Valet, Cymon in Damon and Phillida, Old Man in Lethe, Daniel in the Con&s;cious Lovers, Clown in Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure, Old Woman in Rule a Wife, and parts in that &s;tile. Be&s;ides We&s;ton, the fir&s;t night pre&s;ented Mr. Sowdon in Heartwell and Mr.
<PB N="48" REF="62">
Sparks in Noll Bluff, (both the&s;e gentlemen had changed &s;ides) and a Mi&s;s Kennedy in Letitia.</P>
<P>The next night brought forward Mr. Griffith, a comedian of eminence in the dramatic world, who had been for &s;ome years a principal &s;upport of the Bath theatre. This gentleman was a native of Dublin, &s;on of Mr. Griffith mentioned with much re&s;pect in the former part of this work; he had received a liberal, and extended education, had, in the early part of his life, a genteel employment in the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, and was brother to the celebrated Mrs. Griffith, an authore&s;s of great repute, and who&s;e &s;hare in the letters of Henry and Frances, had rai&s;ed her reputation high in the literary world.</P>
<P>This gentleman, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many abilities for the &s;tage. His per&s;on was &s;mall, but uncom|monly elegant and well made. He was ea&s;y, &s;prightly, and fa&s;hionable; had a marking eye, a plea&s;ing countenance, and a good voice; he perfectly under&s;tood his author, and had great judgment. With the&s;e requi&s;ites, he &s;upported the highe&s;t characters in comedy with eclat. He had much of the gentleman in his manner,
<PB N="49" REF="63">
and was beloved, and e&s;teemed in private, for his many amiable and engaging qualities.</P>
<P>Ranger was the part he cho&s;e to make his debut in: which he &s;upported, with great ap|plau&s;e, and, by de&s;ire, repeated it a few nights after. The public afterwards &s;aw him with great plea&s;ure in Sir Harry Wildair, Jack Stoeks, in the ballad farce of the Lottery, got up on purpo&s;e, Archer, Captain Brazen, Lord Chalk|&s;tone, and the Fine Gentleman in Lethe, Mer|cutio, Lothario, the Man of Ta&s;te, Younger Would be, and a variety of other characters in the &s;ame line.</P>
<P>Two new Polly's made their appearance at the two Theatres, much about this time. At Crow-&s;treet, a Mi&s;s Bridges, with the Macheath of Mr. Vernon, and the Lucy of Mrs. Abington, then e&s;teemed the be&s;t on the &s;tage, and a Mi&s;s Greene at Smock-alley, where Mr. Brown gained much applau&s;e in this, then popular hero. Peachum, Mr. Sparks; Lucy, Mi&s;s Ro&s;co. The opera was pu&s;hed a few nights, and obliged to give way to other pieces of more con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="64">Though the town was much divided in its opinion, concerning the merits of the re&s;pective companies, yet upon a critical examination, the ballance &s;eemed inclined towards Mr. Mo&s;&s;op; &s;everal of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the Crow-&s;treet performers, had enli&s;ted under his banners, as Mr. Sowdon, Mr. Heaphy, Mr. Sparks, Mi&s;s Ma&s;on, Mr. Corry, Mi&s;s Ro&s;co, Mr. Aldridge, Mi&s;s Coralina; to the&s;e he added a variety of other engagements which threw great weight into his &s;cale. Mr. Griffith, Mi&s;s Kennedy, and Mi&s;s Greene, I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>In point of real merit, and public e&s;timation, Mr. Digges certainly &s;tood next to Mr. Mo&s;&s;op and Mr. Barry. With &s;ome difficulty he was prevailed upon to return from Edinburgh, where he was an extraordinary favourite, and join once more the fortunes of Smock Alley. His name and abilities on this occa&s;ion, were a tower of &s;trength, and amply counterbalanced any advan|tages on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>But, the new managers greate&s;t expectations re&s;ted on Mrs. Bellamy, from Covent Garden; he had entertained hopes of Mrs. Fitzhenry, but they were di&s;appointed. Upon mature delibe|ration,
<PB N="51" REF="65">
&s;he preferred the certain &s;ituation &s;he then held, to the un&s;table pro&s;pects which the views of the other hou&s;e afforded. Mrs. Bel|lamy was then in the very zenith of her reputa|tion, and without her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; Mr. Mo&s;&s;op could not have played a &s;ingle tragedy with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. Nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, oblig|ed him to yield to her terms, and he agreed to give her a thou&s;and guineas, be&s;ides two benefits for the &s;ea&s;on: A very capital &s;um for a mana|ger to ri&s;que in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h young gentleman of the name of Shaw, who had never yet appeared on any &s;tage, was al&s;o engaged. He was remarkably tall and thin, but well made, and tolerably ea&s;y: from youth, figure, and manner, he &s;upported a re|&s;pectable line in tragedy and comedy.</P>
<P>The principal novelty of the Crow-&s;treet ma|nagers, was Mr. Fleetwood from Drury Lane, a very plea&s;ing and promi&s;ing actor, but inde|pendant of him, they had undoubtedly great &s;trength in every line of the drama; not only in tragedy and comedy, but al&s;o in mu&s;ical pieces and pantomime.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="66">The merits of Mr. Barry and Mr. Woodward, were at this time too well e&s;tabli&s;hed to need en|larging on. Mrs. Dancer at this period &s;tood high in general e&s;timation. Every day ju&s;tly added to her fame. Nature certainly had been uncommonly bountiful, and gifted her with re|qui&s;ites that fell to the lot of very few actre&s;&s;es.. Happily for the drama, Mr. Barry, who was one of the be&s;t teachers in the world, had every in|clination and opportunity, to bring tho&s;e ripen|ing abilities to maturity: abilities I &s;hall with plea&s;ure endeavour to de&s;cant on, at a future op|portunity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzhenry was al&s;o mo&s;t de&s;ervedly e&s;|teemed the fir&s;t actre&s;s in her line. Admired on the &s;tage, beloved for her re&s;pectable cha|racter in private. Mrs. Abington's comic pow|ers I have before noticed: they excited univer|&s;al applau&s;e. She was already much the fa&s;hion, and contributed highly to the &s;ucce&s;s of the pieces &s;he performed.</P>
<P>But that the reader may form a ju&s;t idea of the two companies, I &s;hall group them together, and leave his own judgment to form a conclu|&s;ion concerning their merits; only ju&s;t premi&s;|ing,
<PB N="53" REF="67">
that Mr. Brown had with a good grace, re|&s;igned the reins of government; and returned to the ranks, where he was of great &s;ervice; that Mr. Ryder led a &s;elect, and well formed com|pany into the interior parts of Ireland, where he continued &s;everal years with character, reputa|tion and &s;ucce&s;s, annually vi&s;iting the towns of Kilkenny, Wexford, Galway and &s;everal others; and that Mrs. Ibbot, the two Mi&s;s Philips's, with &s;everal of le&s;s note returned to England.</P>

<P>What a burthen mu&s;t two &s;uch numerous companies have been to the town! What a di|vi&s;ion of intere&s;ts mu&s;t &s;uch a number of per|formers have occa&s;ioned! What a tax on amu&s;e|ment, to &s;upport upwards of &s;ixty actors and actre&s;&s;es, who with their unavoidable append|ages of &s;ervants, dre&s;&s;ers, hair-dre&s;&s;ers, &amp;c. when united with the bands, mu&s;t have amount|ed, on the lowe&s;t calculation, to upwards of two hundred per&s;ons. The very weekly &s;alaries of the performers only at Crow-&s;treet, often amounted to one hundred and fifty pounds; &s;ometimes more; be&s;ides trade&s;mens bills, and other inevitable di&s;bur&s;ements, without the lea&s;t allowance for them&s;elves, as actors, or mana|gers. So enormous an expence, the receipts of a London theatre, at that time, could but barely &s;u&s;tain; no wonder therefore, that our mana|gers were obliged in a little time, to give way to &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ure, and though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t rectitude of principle, be unable to &s;a|tisfy their creditors.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="70">But to proceed, Mr. Woodward's prologue of "Harry to Harry &s;hall, and Hor&s;e to Hor&s;e" was &s;trictly exemplified, on every opportunity during the &s;ea&s;on. Intimation having been re|ceived, that Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, Mr. Digges, and Mrs. Bellamy, were to make their fir&s;t appearance in Pierre, Jaffier, and Belvidera, the Crow-&s;treet managers on the &s;ame evening, announced Mr. Barry in Pierre, Mr. Fleetwood in Jaffier, his entr&egrave; on the &s;tage in this kingdom, and Mrs. Dancer in Belvidera: with the fir&s;t time of the new Pantomime of Queen Mab; Harlequin, by Woodward; Columbine, Abington.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity and intere&s;t, operated powerfully on this occa&s;ion, in favour of Smock Alley. There was a crowded and fa&s;hionable hou&s;e. Mr. Digges, on opening the play, was received with the warme&s;t and mo&s;t unfeigned plaudits. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's entrance was marked with three rounds of applau&s;e, as la&s;ting as it was &s;incere. Mrs. Bellamy al&s;o, in her turn, received the mo&s;t flat|tering marks of approbation.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t, in the cour&s;e of the play, &s;up|ported their characters with a truth and energy, which ju&s;tly entitled them to every prai&s;e. Mrs.
<PB N="57" REF="71">
Bellamy, on the contrary, &s;unk in the opinion of her auditors. Many years had elap&s;ed &s;ince &s;he left Ireland. Time is &s;eldom an improve|ment of a lady's charms. The ro&s;es and lillies in her countenance had fled, and left a decay too evident. The &s;weet tones of her voice had al|tered to a har&s;hne&s;s, which not being expected, produced the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>The attendance at Crow-&s;treet, the &s;ame even|ing, was not quite &s;o crowded. But the ap|plau&s;e was at lea&s;t equal, and in many points more de&s;erving. If I might hazard an opinion, on the re&s;pective merits of each performance, I &s;hould give the preference, if any, to Smock Alley.</P>
<P>In the character of Pierre, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op was mo&s;t de&s;ervedly &s;uperior. It was, according to the be&s;t judges, as fine and characteri&s;tic a piece of acting as ever was exhibited. His voice, manner, and judgment, were unde&s;cribable.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every requi&s;ite which the mo&s;t luxuriant fancy could &s;ugge&s;t, for the &s;upport of Jaffier, wanted many of the e&s;&s;entials for Pierre. With a form faultle&s;s, and a voice
<PB N="58" REF="72">
modulated to the mo&s;t perfect harmony, he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the roughne&s;s of manners, nor the au&s;terity of demeanour nece&s;&s;ary for the latter character. That grace, and tho&s;e tones, which in the expre&s;&s;ion of every &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ion, were of irre&s;i&s;tible fa&s;cination, but ill depicted the &s;ternne&s;s of the &s;oldier, meditating dark and dangerous con&s;piracies.</P>
<P>Mr. Fleetwood plea&s;ed much in Jaffier: his figure was rather intere&s;ting, his voice and man|ner, &s;uch as are well calculated to gain an in|tere&s;t with the audience; but, in each of the&s;e, he could by no means &s;tand in competition with Mr. Digges, who, next to Mr. Barry, claimed the precedence in &s;uch characters over every other competitor.</P>
<P>Between the ladies, the advantage was evi|dently in favour of Mrs. Dancer. Her talents were then improving rapidly; Mrs. Bellamy's, as rapidly declining. The fir&s;t, gave every night incontrovertible &s;pecimens, that &s;he would one day be the fir&s;t actre&s;s of the age: the latter, gra|dually &s;unk into oblivion, wretchedne&s;s and poverty. Mrs. Dancer's Belvidera, I believe, was equal to that of Mrs. Cibber.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="73">Venice Pre&s;erved was repeated at each hou&s;e, but with no great effect. The remainder of the &s;ea&s;on, proved a continued di&s;agreeable &s;cene of exertions and rival&s;hip, productive of infinite trouble, great expence, and vexation, attended with lo&s;s of reputation, and very little profit, and gradually involving the managers of each hou&s;e in that ruin, which finally overtook both.</P>
<P>For the readers information, and amu&s;ement, I &s;hall &s;elect a few in&s;tances of the above. It &s;eemed to be laid down as a rule, by the re&s;pec|tive managers, that, no &s;ooner was a piece an|nounced to be in rehear&s;al or for exhibition by the one, than the other &s;trained every nerve, no matter with what propriety, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the public with an idea of its being preparing in a &s;uperior &s;tyle by him, or boldly advertizing the very piece, on the very &s;ame evening; &s;ome|times, without an idea of its being performed, but merely to divide or &s;u&s;pend the general curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Thus, the little ballad farce of the Lottery, which, from the limited number of after-pieces, more than its intrin&s;ic merit, was then much in
<PB N="60" REF="74">
fa&s;hion, was no &s;ooner exhibited at Smock-alley, than the week following pre&s;ented it to the pub|lic at Crow-&s;treet; &s;upported by the Jack Stocks of Mr. Griffith, and the admirable Chloe of Mrs. Abington.</P>
<P>The Wife's Re&s;entment, revived at the theatre royal, with Mr. Woodward, Mrs. Dan|cer, and Mrs. Abington, immediately produced an adverti&s;ement, announcing the &s;ame play with Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, though he had not the lea&s;t idea of exhibiting it. Mr. Colman's farce of Polly Honeycombe, then performing with eclat at Drury-lane, was, in like manner, adverti&s;|ed by both parties, but only produced at Crow-&s;treet; on which occa&s;ion, Mrs. Abington ac|quired infinite credit in the part of Polly.</P>
<P>The girli&s;h characters, I &s;incerely think, &s;he then played &s;uperior to any actre&s;s ever re|membered, and from her naivet&eacute;, and genuine traits of nature, the girls of the pre&s;ent actre&s;&s;es are copied.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t piece of general&s;hip, mani|fe&s;ted through the whole of this doubtful conte&s;t was re&s;pecting the new tragedy, of The Orphan
<PB N="61" REF="75">
of China, written by Arthur Murphy, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and at that time exhibiting with uncommon re|putation in London. The great fame and popu|larity of this piece, rendered it an object of peculiar attention to both hou&s;es in Dublin; but, to attain their object, they pur&s;ued quite different lines of conduct.</P>
<P>The play being printed, was con&s;equently, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence on the &s;ubject, and kept his de|&s;igns as much a &s;ecret as po&s;&s;ible. The mana|gers of Crow-&s;treet, on the contrary, confident of their &s;trength, but rather injudiciou&s;ly I &s;hould think, for &s;everal weeks, made a great parade of their intentions of producing it with a pomp and magnificence, equal to that of Drury-lane; informing the public, of the extraordina|ry expence they were at, in having all the dre&s;&s;es made in London, from models imported from China, and an entire new &s;et of &s;cenes paint|ed for the occa&s;ion, in the true Chine&s;e &s;tile, by the celebrated carver, then de&s;ervedly in the highe&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>When the expectations of the town were rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t pitch, and curio&s;ity &s;train|ed
<PB N="62" REF="76">
to the highe&s;t point, without the lea&s;t previous hint dropped, mo&s;t unexpectedly, early on Monday morning January 5th, 1761, bills were po&s;ted up, announcing the repre&s;entation of this much talked of tragedy, that very evening, at Smock-alley theatre. <HI>The &s;cenery, dre&s;&s;es, and decorations entirely new;</HI> with this &s;pecious, and popular addition, <HI>The characters will be all new dre&s;&s;ed in the manufactures of this kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>The truth was, they had be&s;poke dre&s;&s;es, to be made in London, on the models of the Drury-lane habits, but had not the lea&s;t expectation of their arriving in time. As they knew that every thing depended on their producing it before the other hou&s;e, certain they had not an equal chance on equal terms, the dre&s;&s;es and &s;cenery of Crow-&s;treet being &s;o much &s;uperior, they u&s;ed every exertion po&s;&s;ible. The tragedy was rehear&s;ed three times a day, and Mr. Tracey, then tailor to the theatre, working day and night on the dre&s;&s;es, they were completed in eight and forty hours.</P>
<P>The event proved that they acted right. The Orphan of China drew five tolerable hou&s;es to Smock-alley, before they were able to get it out
<PB N="63" REF="77">
at Crow-&s;treet; and then, it did not an&s;wer the expence they had been at. The dre&s;&s;es and &s;cenery, were truly characteri&s;tic, but the curio&s;ity of the public had been in a great mea|&s;ure previou&s;ly gratified.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to &s;cenery, machinery, and de|corations Crow-&s;treet certainly was &s;uperior. Carver was then one of the fir&s;t &s;cene painters in Europe; Mr. Me&s;&s;ink the fir&s;t machini&s;t ever known in this kingdom, and Finny their carpen|ter had infinite merit.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t advantage the Crow-&s;treet ma|nagers obtained over their rivals, was with their pantomimes, which they exhibited on the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and fini&s;hed &s;cale, and in which the Harlequin of Mr. Woodward was decidedly the greate&s;t on the &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="79">This &s;ea&s;on, Queen Mab, and the Sorcerer, were brought out at an enormous expence, and performed many nights, yet, notwith&s;tanding they were exhibited in a &s;tyle of perfection worthy the fir&s;t theatre in Europe, and were univer&s;ally admired, they by no means repaid the enormous expences, attending their repre|&s;entation, and it is my opinion that the manager, who ventures a large &s;um of money on this &s;pecies of entertainment in Dublin, runs a very great ri&s;k of not being reimbur&s;ed.</P>
<P>In London, the ca&s;e is totally different, and the &s;ums laid out on proper objects, are &s;ure to return with ten-fold intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the pantomimes, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op judici|ciou&s;ly revived Henry the 8th, and got up a re|pre&s;entation of the coronation, which, on ac|count of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, was well timed, and brought money. It made a great bill, excited curio&s;ity, and, though the dre&s;&s;es were not very &s;plendid, nor numerous, yet they an&s;wered the purpo&s;e, and the play drew &s;everal hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="80">I cannot, in this place, avoid noticing a cir|cum&s;tance, which ought to &s;erve as a le&s;&s;on to every performer in future.</P>
<P>The farce of High Life was then in great reputation, at both hou&s;es. One night, Mr. Stayley, of Smock-alley theatre, in one of the characters, gave the toa&s;t of <HI>"his maje&s;ty king George the &s;econd, God re&s;t his bones."</HI></P>
<P>This very extraordinary toa&s;t, though it might be &s;aid to expre&s;s nothing di&s;loyal, yet was certainly highly improper, and a liberty which ought not to be taken on any &s;tage. Se|veral of the audience highly re&s;ented it, and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op with great propriety publickly reprimand|ed him for it. Mr. Stayley, endeavoured to ju&s;tify him&s;elf; words en&s;ued, and in the con|clu&s;ion, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the theatre.</P>
<P>He then appealed to the public, but with lit|tle &s;ucce&s;s; and, as he had before created him|&s;elf many enemies, by his writing and mimickry, he was pitied by few, blamed by mo&s;t, and never after regained his &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="81">This occurrence leads me to remark, the very great impropriety of any performer taking &s;uch liberties with an audience. They certainly &s;hould introduce no joke, or matter, not &s;trictly con&s;onant to their author, and with which the manager was not acquainted. He is, in every ca&s;e, re&s;pon&s;ible to the public, for what is &s;aid and done on his &s;tage. Audiences are as variable in their di&s;po&s;itions as the individuals who com|po&s;e them. It is dangerous to &s;port with their pa&s;&s;ions, and the manager, who has &s;o much at &s;take, ought to be made acquainted with every innovation, however trifling. He alone ought to judge of their propriety, as he alone mu&s;t be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The occurrences of the remaining part of the &s;ea&s;on, worth mentioning, are but few. Mr. Murphy's excellent comedy, The Way to Keep Him, in five acts, was fir&s;t performed in this kingdom, at Crow-&s;treet in February, 1761, where Mrs. Abington added much to her repu|tation, by the ea&s;y, elegant, fini&s;hed portrait, of the woman of fa&s;hion, which &s;he exhibited in the widow Belmour. Mrs. Bellamy played Cleone, with &s;ome applau&s;e, at Smock-alley.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="82">Mr. Colman's new comedy of the Jealous Wife, was then bringing crowded hou&s;es at Drury-lane. It's extraordinary merit, as it cer|tainly ranks among&s;t the fir&s;t comedies in the Engli&s;h language, and the &s;ucce&s;s attending its repre&s;entation, induced Mr. Mo&s;&s;op to pre&s;ent it to the public, late in the month of May, &s;up|ported in the following manner:</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Dramatic portraits of Me&s;&s;rs. Barry, Mo&s;&s;op, Digges, and Woodward&mdash;Their re&s;pective me|rits&mdash;The &s;everal characters in which they ex|celled&mdash;Re&s;pectability of the Iri&s;h &s;tage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE eminence of the Iri&s;h &s;tage, at the period to which we are now arrived, and the very great ability, with which &s;everal of it's principal departments were filled, &s;eem to point out this, as a proper place, to pau&s;e and take a &s;light review of &s;ome of its principal &s;up|porters.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. Barry, Mo&s;&s;op, Digges, and Woodward, were then in the zenith of their cour&s;e: an im|partial, though imperfect, &s;ketch of their re&s;pec|tive merits, may, therefore, be be&s;t attempted here.</P>
<P>The character of Mr. Barry, has been already touched upon, in the fir&s;t volume of this work.
<PB N="71" REF="85">
In addition to that, I hope the following remarks, which I have with little alteration, copied from a gentleman, who had every opportunity of form|ing a ju&s;t judgment of his abilities, will not prove unacceptable.</P>
<P>There never was, perhaps, an actor, who, altogether was &s;o much indebted to nature, as Barry. As far as figure will warrant the expre&s;|&s;ion, he was certainly, the fini&s;hed portrait of man. His per&s;on was noble, and commanding; his action graceful, and correct; his features regular, expre&s;&s;ive, and rather hand&s;ome: his countenance, naturally open, placid, and bene|volent, yet ea&s;ily wrought to the indications of haughtine&s;s, and contempt: but in the &s;ofter expre&s;&s;ions of the tender, and feeling emotions, he principally excelled.</P>
<P>His voice was finely calculated to aid his ap|pearance. It had melody, depth, and &s;trength; there was a bur&s;t of grief in it, which was pe|culiar to him&s;elf. In the la&s;t act of E&s;&s;ex, where the officers were preparing his departure, and where he pointed to his wife, lying on the ground, with
<Q>Oh look there!</Q>
<PB N="72" REF="86">
His manner of expre&s;&s;ion was &s;o forcible and affecting, that the whole hou&s;e always bur&s;t into tears. He &s;aw the effect, and often u&s;ed the cau&s;e, &s;ometimes rather improperly. In ex|pre&s;&s;ing the blended pa&s;&s;ions of love, tenderne&s;s, and grief, Barry &s;tood unrivalled.</P>
<P>With &s;uch abilities, it would be difficult to point out which character was his ma&s;ter-piece. But it is generally given to his Othello. It was a performance, which could not be tran&s;|cended. His addre&s;s to the &s;enate, was &s;upe|rior to that of any man who even &s;poke it. His various tran&s;itions, in the jealous &s;cenes of that character, were beautiful, beyond de&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>The vanqui&s;her of A&s;ia, never appeared to more advantage in repre&s;entation, than in the per&s;on of Barry: he looked, moved, and acted the hero and lover, in a manner that charmed every audience that &s;aw him: he gave new life and vigour to a play, which had lain neglected, &s;ince the death of Delane.</P>
<P>His Marc Antony had innumerable beauties. Indeed, his very appearance, in this magnifi|cent
<PB N="73" REF="87">
Roman, who lo&s;t the world for love, in the young conquering Macedonian hero, and in every other character in that line, was equal to what the mo&s;t romantic imagination could paint.</P>
<P>The limits of this work, will not permit me to follow him through the various beauties of his numerous characters. Suffice it to &s;ay, that tho&s;e who were &s;o happy as to &s;ee him in the above, or, in the cour&s;e of years, in Varanes, Macbeth, Jaffier, O&s;myn, Ore&s;tes, Horatio, Ha&s;tings, Romeo, Oroonoko, Ca&s;talio, Hot&s;pur, Lear, Lord Townly, Young Bevil, &amp;c. univer|&s;ally concurred in the opinion, that, as they had never &s;een his equal, &s;o would it be ages, per|haps, before another Barry would ari&s;e.</P>
<P>With very oppo&s;ite powers, yet with &s;uch dramatic abilities as fall to the lot of very few, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op next claims our attention. Never was there a greater contra&s;t than between the&s;e heroes: never were two performers better cal|culated by nature to &s;hine together, to reflect lu&s;tre on each others performances, and &s;upport the oppo&s;ite characters in tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="88">I may not, perhaps, be &s;econded, in my opi|nion: but, I cannot help con&s;idering Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, not only as an original, but as a &s;ingular actor: nor do I recollect, in the long li&s;t of capital performers, who preceded him, or whom we have &s;ince &s;een, one to whom he could &s;trictly be compared.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an agreeable per&s;on; he was of the middle &s;ize, well made: his action, at this time much improved, and with great propriety &s;uited to the &s;ituation of the &s;cene: his countenance, uncommonly marking, and expre&s;|&s;ive, his eye, piercing, and big with what his mind contained.</P>
<P>But, what eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him from all his cotemporaries, was the excellence of his voice. It had a peculiarity of tone, equally di&s;|tingui&s;hing as Mr. Barry's; though in every re&s;pect, oppo&s;ite: it was, perhaps, as fine, full toned, articulate, and &s;olemnly impre&s;&s;ive as any actor's that ever trod the &s;tage: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of unu&s;ual compa&s;s, it was admirably adapted, by its cadences, to di&s;play the great, the grand, and the &s;ublime in tragedy: it conveyed, equally di&s;tinct, the loude&s;t effu&s;ions of rage, which the
<PB N="75" REF="89">
warmth of pa&s;&s;ion required, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;entiments of the deepe&s;t declamation.</P>
<P>There were, I believe, many in&s;tances where he more forcibly impre&s;t his auditors, by the energy, &s;pirit, and fire, of his tones, than they ever experienced from any other performer. In the great and terrible, he ro&s;e beyond idea. There were many pa&s;&s;ages of his Zanga, Corio|lanus, Bajazet, Virginius and Richard, which a&s;toni&s;hed, and were &s;uperior to the bolde&s;t conception before formed of tho&s;e characters.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op had al&s;o received a cla&s;&s;ical educa|tion, in Trinity College. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much judgment, and in general, did uncommon ju&s;|tice to his author.</P>
<P>To the parts above mentioned, I may add, his Duke in Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure, which was truly a capital piece of acting, his King John, Ventidius, Chamont, Zampti, Achmet in Bar|baro&s;&s;a, Cato, Macbeth, Hot&s;pur, O&s;man in Zara, Horatio, Shore, Wol&s;ey, Iago, Pro&s;pero, and many others.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="90">Such were the tragic actors, Ireland then, with hone&s;t pride, could boa&s;t. I am afraid "we ne'er &s;hall look upon their like again." Since their days, tragedy has rapidly declined in public e&s;timation; nor is there, at pre&s;ent, any immediate pro&s;pect of its re-e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that tho&s;e characters as above delineated, differ in &s;everal e&s;&s;entials from the accounts of Mr. Davies, and the multitude of Engli&s;h critics, who, as they do not allow them that extraordinary merit, which I have a&s;cribed, &s;o neither do they &s;pare charging them with glaring faults, which take much from their &s;uperior excellence.</P>
<P>In reply, I can &s;ay; that tho&s;e critici&s;ms were formed in very unfavourable circum&s;tances; without the opportunities of beholding them, in their &s;everal capital characters, from whence a proper criterion could be formed. My portraits are drawn from a time, when they were in the meridian of life; when their powers had arrived at maturity, and the judgment had acquired i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> rightful &s;overeignty over the pa&s;&s;ions. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> decided &s;en&s;e of this kingdom, for many years, warrants my a&s;&s;ertions, and at pre&s;ent, thou|&s;ands
<PB N="77" REF="91">
are living witne&s;&s;es of the truth of my ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It remains next to &s;peak of Mr. Digges. This gentleman then certainly &s;tood next, in merit and reputation, to the&s;e ju&s;tly admired perform|ers. Few men ever gave their auditors &s;o happy an idea of the ea&s;y, fini&s;hed gentleman, and man of fa&s;hion, as Mr. Digges. The elegance of his figure and deportment, the ea&s;e, and pro|priety of his action, with the ju&s;tne&s;s of his conceptions and delivery, mo&s;t de&s;ervedly gained him numerous admirers.</P>
<P>He had, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, a few pe|culiarities, which made &s;ome, at fir&s;t view, &s;tile him a manneri&s;t. But, an intimate ac|quaintance with his mode removed tho&s;e impre&s;|&s;ions, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his abilities, on the firme&s;t ba&s;is.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the winter, Mr. Digges, entered into a connection, with Mrs. Bellamy, which continued for &s;ome years, and was pro|ductive of much unhappine&s;s. The fair apolo|gi&s;t, in her life, glo&s;&s;es over this tran&s;action, with the &s;ame happy facility with which &s;he has
<PB N="78" REF="92">
done many others, that were not &s;trictly recon|cileable to the laws of virtue, or religion. She calls it a &s;erious connection, which though not binding by the laws of the country, with per|&s;ons of her per&s;ua&s;ion, was, notwith&s;tanding, valid to all moral intents and purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>For the following character of Mr. Wood|ward, I am obliged to a cotemporary of his, who &s;eemed, with great judgment, and candour, to be well acquainted with his merits.</P>
<Q><P>If frequent peals of laughter be a te&s;t of merit, Mr. Woodward mo&s;t enjoys the favour of the town, and maintains it through the variety of comic characters, in which he ap|pears. In his de&s;igning of character, he is many times &s;ingular, but often incorrect; if he has not ea&s;e, he has a manner that &s;tands in the place of it, and let him be never &s;o deficient, he never di&s;plea&s;es, his performance being happily calculated to catch the eye at fir&s;t &s;ight, and &s;upported by a vivacity, joined to a genteel, well made figure, that never fails to make a proper impre&s;&s;ion, and bias his audience in his favour. In Sofia, he is extremely happy; and Bobadil, by which he
<PB N="79" REF="93">
has acquired a va&s;t increa&s;e of reputation, is a part of his own creation, and a proof of his genius; he is admirably characteri&s;tic, and entirely original.</P>
<P>Nor has he le&s;s merit in Duretete; his be|haviour, when &s;hut up among&s;t the women, is truly admirable. His Scrub is rather too grote&s;que, but in Tom, and Li&s;&s;ardo, he makes up &s;ufficiently for the defect. He gave Fal&s;taff much too old an appearance, yet a levity of deportment irreconcileable to fat Jack. He is well in the Bu&s;y Body. The character of Fla&s;h, in Mi&s;s in her Teens, and the fine gentleman in Lethe, he illu&s;trates with &s;o many different &s;trokes of humour, that it is hard to &s;ay, whether in the boa&s;ting cowardice of the one, or the affected elegance of the other, he mo&s;t excells. In tho&s;e of Touch&s;tone, Bra&s;s, Beau Mizen, Mercutio, Trappolin, he is unrivalled.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mu&s;t &s;ay, his acting is &s;pirited and vivacious. He has judgment, that enables him to da&s;h, with unexpected &s;trokes of humour, things dull in them&s;elves; and he often throws over his performance an
<PB N="80" REF="94">
air that inforces on the &s;pectator, and give to his performance the appearance of origi|nality.</P></Q>
<P>At this period al&s;o, the merits of Mrs. Dancer and Mrs. Abington, were ri&s;ing highly in e&s;ti|mation, and they were con&s;idered, by the be&s;t judges, as the mo&s;t promi&s;ing actre&s;&s;es of the day; a promi&s;e, which, how well it has been performed, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame rea&s;ons which tempted me, in this place, to enter upon the character of the gentlemen I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed, induce me to po&s;tpone the enquiry concerning the&s;e ladies, to a time when their fuller merits will yield them more adequate ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The review we have taken, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight as it is, may be &s;ufficient to give us &s;ome idea of the value of the performers of that period, and of the re&s;pectability, to which the Iri&s;h &s;tage was then entitled.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN a former chapter of this volume, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chapter the &s;econd, page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</NOTE> mention has been made of a new theatre, built and open|ed by Me&s;&s;rs. Barry and Woodward, at Cork. Upon &s;ub&s;equent con&s;ideration, I find that there has been an error in the date. It was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the &s;ummer of the year 1761, the period <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which, we now are, that the new theatre was opened. The confu&s;ion, created by a mul|tiplicity of other avocations, was the cau&s;e of this mi&s;take, and it was not di&s;covered till too late to be rectified; a detail, &s;omewhat more accurate, will, I hope, in &s;ome &s;ort apologi&s;e for the error.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="96">During the infancy of the &s;tage in Ireland, Cork was frequently vi&s;ited by itinerant com|panies of comedians, who &s;ometimes &s;pent an entire winter there with much emolument. The theatres, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, were generally temporary &s;tructures, ha&s;tily erected for the im|mediate purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, the Dublin managers ex|tended their views to a city, &s;o capable of &s;up|plying the intervening time, between the clo&s;e and the opening of their winter &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The country companies were obliged to give place to his maje&s;ty's &s;ervants, and a new theatre was erected at the corner of Princes-&s;treet in George's-&s;treet, where the Bu&s;h Tavern at pre|&s;ent &s;tands, and opened in the year 1736. On this &s;tage the Elrington's, Woffington, Sheridan, and the mo&s;t capital performers of the age, di&s;|played their powers.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. Barry and Woodward, with a judici|ous eye, beheld the many advantages likely to ari&s;e from a theatre, on a more extended &s;cale in &s;o capital a &s;ituation; the pre&s;ent one being much too &s;mall for their proce&s;&s;ions and panto|mimes.
<PB N="83" REF="97">
They had accordingly adverti&s;ed a &s;ub|&s;cription, for rai&s;ing a fund towards building a new theatre. The propo&s;al was eagerly em|braced; in a few weeks the money was rai&s;ed. The ground was purcha&s;ed in George's-&s;treet, not far from the former building, in a &s;ituation which every day improved, and the work be|gan.</P>
<P>The model adopted, was that of Crow-&s;treet. The dimen&s;ions were nearly as large, ex|cept having but one gallery. It was fini&s;hed, and ready for the reception of the company this &s;ummer, and the public expre&s;&s;ed great plea|&s;ure at &s;o great an improvement in their fa|vourite amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide was &s;pacious, elegant, and con|venient: it held 150<HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h, at 4 <HI>s.</HI> the boxes 3 <HI>s.</HI> the pit, and 2 <HI>s.</HI> the gallery. The &s;tage was remarkably roomy, being nearly as large as Covent-garden was, before the late alterations; capable of exhibiting to advantage, Mr. Bar|ry's grand tragic proce&s;&s;ions, and Mr. Wood|ward's pantomimes, both of which were there pre&s;ented in a &s;tile of perfection, which there was not a po&s;&s;ibility of doing before.</P>

<P>From the above li&s;t of performers, and indeed from many others which could be given of other times, it will plainly appear that the Cork au|dience have been accu&s;tomed to the be&s;t of acting. From this circum&s;tance, in all probability, has ari&s;en, in a great mea&s;ure, that ju&s;tne&s;s of judg|ment in theatrical affairs, for which they are &s;o remarkable.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;on will, I think, warrant me in a&s;&s;erting, that none but a Dublin manager can have the lea&s;t chance of &s;ucceeding with them. His &s;ituation during the winter in the capital, and the number of exotics, which he is obliged to import every &s;ummer, give him a &s;uperiority, in point of entertainment, over every other com|petitor in this kingdom.</P>
<P>With &s;uch recommendations, it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that the Cork &s;ea&s;on of 1761, proved uncommonly brilliant and profitable. The company returned to Dublin, flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="100">Mr. Woodward lo&s;t no time, but immediately &s;ailed for England, and the day following, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op arrived with Mrs. Abington, whom he had gained over from the enemy.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the contending powers at this period, was nearly that of equality. If there was any &s;uperiority, it lay on Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's &s;ide. Be&s;ides Mrs. Abington, who then &s;tood &s;o high in public e&s;timation, Mrs. Fitzhenry had enli&s;ted under his banners. Tho&s;e ladies &s;eemed ap|prehen&s;ive of the power, lately acquired by Mrs. Dancer, and cho&s;e the pro&s;pect of an undivided empire, at the other theatre. Mr. Ryder, who had been ab&s;ent the la&s;t winter, returned at this time to Smock-alley, where in future we &s;hall find him take that lead which his merit &s;o highly entitled him to.</P>
<P>To endeavour to balance the&s;e lo&s;&s;es was Mr. Woodward's employment at pre&s;ent in Lon|don.</P>
<P>Smock-alley took the field at this juncture, and opened on the 12th of October, 1761, with the Spani&s;h Fryar, in which Mr. Baddely of Drury-lane, made his fir&s;t appearance in Gomez.
<PB N="87" REF="101">
This actor has certainly a great deal of merit in &s;everal characters. There are many of the Frenchmen, Jews, and parts of a dry cynical humour, which from him have peculiar manner, and originality. Through the remainder of the &s;ea&s;on, we find him &s;upporting a very re&s;pecta|ble line of bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;uch as, Touch&s;tone, Sir Francis Gripe, Frenchman in Lethe, Dr. Caius, Mr. Honeycombe, &amp;c. The &s;ame night, Mi&s;s Ambro&s;e made her entr&egrave; in Elvira; of her but little mention is afterwards made.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the ill effects produced by two theatres, was that of &s;educing performers from their fir&s;t engagements. Changing &s;ides was &s;o much the fa&s;hion, and &s;ome gentlemen were &s;o much in this mode of manoevering, that they were &s;ometimes led into great mi&s;takes, and have often been called to begin a play at one theatre, when they have been found dre&s;&s;ing at another.</P>
<P>The &s;anction of the theatre royal, continued to be of great u&s;e to Crow-&s;treet, and Mr. Barry opened on the 24th of October, 1761, by com|mand of the Earl of Halifax, with Romeo.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="102">Soon after, Mr. Woodward returned with the celebrated Mi&s;s Elliot, then in great reputation as a fine girl, and plea&s;ing actre&s;s. On the 11th of November following, &s;he came for|ward in her favourite character of Maria in the Citizen, which as it was purpo&s;ely written by Mr. Murphy, to give &s;cope to her abilities, &s;o did &s;he excell in this elegant, &s;prightly, playful girl, all her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Mr. Woodward was the young Philpot, and the farce was &s;everal times repeated. Mi&s;s Elliot afterwards played Mrs. Harlow, Je&s;&s;ica, Euphro&s;ine, Mi&s;s Notable, Cherry, Columbine, Polly Honeycombe, the School Boy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Much about this time, Mr. Thomas Barry, &s;on to the manager, was fir&s;t introduced to the public in Tamerlane; his father playing Bajaze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. This young gentleman's figure was light and plea&s;ing, but his abilities were far from being of the fir&s;t rate. He ju&s;t attained mediocrity, and might be &s;aid, never to offend.</P>
<P>His next trial was in the intere&s;ting Norval Douglas, where his age, abilities, and figure, con&s;pired to render him a proper repre&s;entative for the Scotti&s;h youth. He continued &s;everal
<PB N="89" REF="103">
years on the &s;tage, and though he could not be con&s;idered as a valuable acqui&s;ition, yet was he of con&s;iderable &s;ervice in &s;upporting a fir&s;t and &s;econd line of characters in tragedy and co|medy.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s, notwith&s;tanding &s;o much novelty, continuing but very indifferent, the managers, as their dernier re&s;ort, produced the veteran Macklin, who at that time was acknowledged to be the fir&s;t actor in his line, on the &s;tage. He was then upwards of &s;ixty years of age. His Mi&s;er, Shylock, Iago, drew money, and were often repeated.</P>
<P>In December, he brought out his Love A la mode, which met with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s, being performed upwards of &s;ixteen nights that &s;ea&s;on. In this piece, Mr. Barry played Sir Callaghan, Mr. Woodward, Squire Groom; Mr. Me&s;&s;ink, Beau Mordecai; and Mr. Mack|lin, Sir Archy M'Sarca&s;m; a farce of &s;uch merit, and &s;o well &s;upported, had not been &s;een for many years.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Crow-&s;treet imports of this year, Mr. Stamper requires to be remembered. He
<PB N="90" REF="104">
was de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed in &s;uch characters as the Mi&s;er, Scrub, &amp;c. Some years after, he played at Edinburgh, and &s;upported that line of bu&s;ine&s;s with much reputation.</P>
<P>Fortune, at this time, &s;eemed to incline to|wards Mr. Mo&s;&s;op. The town, though torn and divided by contending parties, which often produced di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, rather fa|voured his theatre, and he was remarkably hap|py in &s;everal of his engagements.</P>
<P>I have before mentioned Mr. Wilkin&s;on. His former popularity and &s;ucce&s;s, induced Mr. Mo&s;&s;op to con&s;ider him as a powerful auxiliary. He accordingly concluded a treaty with him for twelve nights, and a benefit, and he appeared in January, 1762, in Mr. Foote's comedy of the Minor, where he per&s;onified the characters of Mrs. Cole, Shift, Smirk, Transfer, and Dr. Squintum, and which, notwith&s;tanding its bad fortune two years before, plea&s;ed much and brought &s;everal hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkin&s;on's trip fully an&s;wered, both as to reputation and profit. He brought the manager money, and his own benefit was re|markbly
<PB N="91" REF="105">
great. He then acceeded to overtures from Mr. Woodward, who offered him Twenty guineas for four nights, and a clear benefit. He con&s;equently appeared at Crow-&s;treet, in Kitely, in Every Man in his Humour, in which Wood|ward played Bobadil, to an excellent hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the June following, Mr. Wilkin&s;on re|turned to England, highly plea&s;ed with the flattering reception he had met with in Dublin.</P>
<P>But what Mr. Mo&s;&s;op relied mo&s;t on, and on which he had founded the mo&s;t &s;anguine expec|tations, was a &s;pecies of entertainment which had novelty to recommend it. He opened a &s;ub&s;cription for an Italian Burletta, which fully an&s;wered his wi&s;hes. Mo&s;t of the nobilith and gentry were plea&s;ed with the idea, and the &s;ub|&s;cription filled &s;o well as to enable him to carry his de&s;ign into execution.</P>
<P>After much preparation, on the 19th of December, the comic opera of <HI>La Ca&s;cina,</HI> was performed. The principal characters by, Signior Antonio Minelli, the director of the Burletta, Signior Dominico de Amicis, Signior Giovan
<PB N="92" REF="106">
Batti&s;ti Zingoni, Signiora Maria Anna de Amicis, Signiora Anna Dunlap, and Signiora Anna Lucia de Amicis, the mu&s;ic by Galuppi, the dances by Signior Tioli, Signior Giu&s;eppe Genovi&s;i, Signiora Ricci, and Signiora Vin|cenze Lucchi. The boxes and pit were laid to|gether, at five briti&s;h &s;hillings; the galleries remained at their u&s;ual prices.</P>
<P>The Burletta plea&s;ed much. The performers were approved of, e&s;pecially Anna Lucia de Amicis, who became a great favourite. It drew a great deal of money, and was continued during the &s;ea&s;on. However, they quarrelled among them&s;elves, and Signior Minelli, the original director, was obliged to re&s;ign to De Amicis, who&s;e family compo&s;ed the principal part of the entertainment. Minelli &s;ettled in Dublin, in the wine and &s;pirit trade. He is &s;till living on the Bachelor's-walk, a gentleman of worth and character.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e this rage of the public, the Bur|letta of Midas was fir&s;t produced. It's author, Kane O'Hara, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was a gentleman of good connections, and well known in the fa&s;hionable world. The piece was put into rehear&s;al, with great expectations, and announced, in ridicule
<PB N="93" REF="107">
of the others, under the conduct of Signior Jo&s;ephi Verneni, (hone&s;t Jo. Vernon) The principal characters by him&s;elf, Signior Patrico Mahoni, Signior Lewi&s;o Olivero, Signiora Fredri&s;unda Bridge&s;a, Signiora Elizabetta Glo|verina, and Signiora Maria Juvanelli; with dancing by the afterwards celebrated Sling&s;by.</P>
<P>Midas was brought out in January, 1762, and for &s;ome time, was &s;trongly &s;upported. The Earl of Halifax, honoured the 4th night with his pre&s;ence, and it continued to be occa&s;ionally acted during the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>That the Burletta of Midas, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an ex|traordinary degree of merit, is univer&s;ally al|lowed. It is, in my opinion, &s;uperior to every one of the numerous productions of that &s;pecies, which have &s;ince followed it. In its original &s;tate, of three acts, it certainly was too long, and palled upon the audience; but reduced as at pre&s;ent to an after piece, its &s;ucce&s;s has been remarkable, and it ever will hold a di&s;tingui&s;hed place among&s;t the entertainments of the &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="108">Fortune &s;till continued to follow the banner of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op; his hou&s;es were, in general, better attended, and more fa&s;hionable, than tho&s;e of Crow-&s;treet. The Counte&s;s of Brandon continued his &s;teady patrone&s;s. The pieces in which him&s;elf and Mrs. Fitzhenry appeared, generally drew crowded audiences. The&s;e were con&s;iderably &s;trengthened, by the acce&s;&s;ion of another actor, who had then been but a &s;hort time on the &s;tage, yet had di&s;played great abili|ties, and who, a few years after, &s;upported the principal characters of the drama with great re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>This was no other than Mr. Reddi&s;h, who made his fir&s;t entr&egrave; on the Iri&s;h &s;tage, in Etan, in the Orphan of China, and made a mo&s;t fa|vourable impre&s;&s;ion on the audience, by his fi|gure, voice, manner, and other requi&s;ites. This gentleman remained &s;everal years in Ire|land, and then returned to London, where he was much e&s;teemed, and admired.</P>
<P>The comedy of All in the Wrong, written by Mr. Murphy, was then performing with &s;uch eclat in London, as to make it well worthy the attention of the Dublin managers. Each party
<PB N="95" REF="109">
prepared for its repre&s;entation. It was announc|ed with much pomp, as in rehear&s;al at Crow-&s;treet; when, after five or &s;ix days hard &s;tudy, it was mo&s;t unexpectedly one morning, without any previous notice, adverti&s;ed for that evening at Smock-alley. The con&s;equence was, it was pu&s;hed on &s;ix nights, before they could po&s;&s;ibly bring it forward at Crow-&s;treet, and then it was not worth much to either parties. Not|with&s;tanding which, it was played &s;ixteen nights that &s;ea&s;on, at Smock-alley.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t treat, the Crow-&s;treet mana|gers pre&s;ented to the public, was the engagement of Mrs. Pritchard. That fir&s;t of Engli&s;h actre&s;&s;es, appeared in Lady Macbeth, June 14th, 1762. Though in the decline of life, yet &s;uch was the &s;uperior force of her powers, that &s;he charmed the critical part of her auditors, to the highe&s;t degree But her figure operated much in her disfavour with many. Youth and beauty, on the &s;tage, make impre&s;&s;ions, which merit, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the&s;e powerful auxillaries, can &s;eldom attain.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of Mrs. Pritchard, drew a very crowded hou&s;e. Mrs. Oakly was her
<PB N="96" REF="110">
next, which &s;he repeated twice. Whether from nece&s;&s;ity, or whatever other motive I know not, but we find this lady placed in &s;everal &s;ituations, in which, notwith&s;tanding her uncommon merit, &s;he mu&s;t appear, from her figure, to little advantage. As Mrs. Sullen, Lady Betty Modi&s;h, Clarinda, and Jane Shore. However, &s;he made ample amends in Zara, and Merope, with the latter of which &s;he clo&s;ed the theatre, July 19th, when &s;he returned to England, leaving as fa|vourable an impre&s;&s;ion on the Iri&s;h audience, as her long tried abilities had unalterably fixed for the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding any little temporary &s;uc|ce&s;s, during the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, the in|tere&s;ts of the Crow-&s;treet theatre were vi&s;ibly on the decline. The Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Halifax, it is true, afforded his patronage, and generally commanded at lea&s;t once a week. Se|veral very excellent pantomimes al&s;o, particu|larly two new ones, the Fair, and the Sorcerer, were produced. Yet, in &s;pite of all the&s;e ad|vantages and exertions, the managers found their receipts infinitely inferior to their di&s;bur&s;ements, which indeed were too heavy for a Dublin theatre to &s;upport</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="111">Mr. Woodward, who was a plain hone&s;t man, and who had &s;unk a capital of &s;ome thou&s;ands, the produce of many years oeconomy in London, be|gan to grow unea&s;y, and inclined to withdraw him&s;elf from the partner&s;hip, which &s;eemed to threaten final ruin.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry had le&s;s at &s;take: his property was incon&s;iderable, and his fame &s;uffered no diminu|tion, from this rever&s;e of fortune. He was therefore determined to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>The difficulties they were involved in, natu|rally occa&s;ioned mi&s;under&s;tandings, which &s;uc|ce&s;s would mo&s;t probably have prevented. Barry thought Woodward's expences for pantomimes, too great, he, in return, exclaimed again&s;t Barry's tragedy proce&s;&s;ions. Each day added to their differences, and towards the clo&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, it &s;eemed to be the mutual wi&s;h of both, to &s;eparate.</P>
<P>An arbitration appears to hare been entered into between the parties, but afterwards not abided by. This produced a paper war. Each, as is cu&s;tomary in &s;uch ca&s;es, laid the blame of
<PB N="98" REF="112">
the rupture upon the other, and both, in all probability, were conducive towards it.</P>

<P>This produced a recriminating adverti&s;ement from Mr. Barry, which was followed by a &s;econd and third, of the &s;ame nature. It would yield but little entertainment to follow the whole of this controver&s;y, through all it's &s;tages. Much le&s;s to copy all which appeared in the new&s;papers concerning it. Suffice it to &s;ay, it terminated in a total and final &s;eperation.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="113">Thus ended a partner&s;hip, which promi&s;ed &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s at the beginning, and from which, though the public occa&s;ionally reaped &s;uch extraordinary entertainment, yet altogether, the evils ari&s;ing, more than overbalanced the advantages. The managers lo&s;t many thou&s;and pounds, and involved them&s;elves in a &s;uit in Chancery; many debts were contracted, not &s;ince di&s;charged, and many ob&s;tinate parties, and attachments formed, which the following years rather inflamed, than appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The victorious party, to all appearance, fini&s;h|ed their career with eclat, and yet, if the truth were known, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op had no great rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the &s;tate of his finances. It was a victory for which the conquerors had rea&s;on to weep.</P>
<P>Mr. King, who on quitting Dublin, had re|turned to a high &s;tation at Drury-lane, was at this time a mo&s;t de&s;erving favourite with the town. Him Mr. Mo&s;&s;op engaged for a few nights, to conclude his campaign with.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Woodward returns to London.&mdash;Theatres de|cline.&mdash;Mrs. Abington engaged at Drury-lane.&mdash; Mrs. Burden, Mr. Foote, Mr. Atkins.&mdash;Li&s;t of both companies.&mdash;King Arthur brought out of Crow-&s;treet.&mdash;Its &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Mu&s;ic gets forward.&mdash; Oratorio's.&mdash;Latter &s;ea&s;on at Crow-&s;treet.&mdash;Mr. Shuter, Mr. Dyer, Mrs. Clive, Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Luke Sparks, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ington.&mdash;Love in, a Village.&mdash;Mrs. Abington, Mr. Woodward, of Smock-alley.&mdash;Sea&s;on clo&s;es at both hou&s;es.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE difficulties Mr. Barry had to &s;truggle with, did not deter him from continuing the competition. He &s;till had a very powerful party remaining in Dublin. His abilities as an actor were univer&s;ally admired, and he hoped by his a&s;&s;iduity, to &s;upply the lo&s;s of his colleague. It was a lo&s;s however, of too great con&s;equence to be ea&s;ily &s;uplied. Mr. Woodward was, with great ju&s;tice, a favourite with the town,
<PB N="104" REF="118">
whil&s;t his attention, indu&s;try, and punctuality, added great weight to his management.</P>
<P>That Mr. Woodward had great rea&s;on to be heartily tired of the &s;cheme he was embarked in, every one mu&s;t allow. As a private man, his character was unexceptionable; as a performer, he mo&s;t de&s;ervedly &s;tood foremo&s;t in his profe&s;|&s;ion; and as a manager, the public were under many obligations to him. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a capital, which, with prudence, would have rendered him independant for life, his evil genius laid the &s;nare of ambition in his way, and, in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unlucky hour, he con&s;ented to lead an oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>After four years con&s;tant anxiety, fatigue, and trouble, he returned to his native country, with the lo&s;s of the greate&s;t part of his fortune, obliged to begin the world again. This, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, was enough to four his temper; yet it were to be wi&s;hed, he had not, on his appearance at Covent-garden, when he &s;poke the following prologue, in the character of a returned prodi|gal, put on that humiliating &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which a Briti&s;h audience were too generous to expect,

<P><PB N="107" REF="121">The &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;on in Dublin, exhibited nothing very remarkable. The theatres were vi&s;ibly on the decline; unable to &s;upport the expence of &s;o continued an oppo&s;ition, the ma|nagers found every day added to the precariou&s;|ne&s;s, and danger of their &s;ituation, without the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of relief. The receipts of the two theatres were &s;carcely &s;ufficient to defray the ex|penditure of one. The greate&s;t contention &s;eemed to be, not who &s;hould gain mo&s;t, but who &s;hould lo&s;e the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The comic mu&s;s was al&s;o at this time de|prived of her greate&s;t &s;upporters. Mr. Wood|ward I have ju&s;t mentioned: Mrs. Abington was engaged at Drury-lane, and Mr. Browne, I be|lieve, returned to Bath. The two la&s;t were &s;evere lo&s;&s;es to Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, and the&s;e were en|crea&s;ed by the de&s;ertion of Mr. Reddi&s;h and Mr. Sowdon, who had gone over to the adver&s;e party.</P>
<P>In &s;ome mea&s;ure to counterballance the&s;e, he gained over Mr. Dexter, and imported Mrs. Burden, who was obliged to &s;upport Mrs. Abington's line of bu&s;ine&s;s, with very little ad|vantage to her&s;elf; a Mi&s;s Par&s;ons, from the
<PB N="108" REF="122">
Hay-market; a Mi&s;s Skyddart, from the Che&s;ter company, who had a fine voice, and opened in Nell; and a Mi&s;s Stratford, who&s;e fir&s;t appear|ance was in Cordelia. To the&s;e were added, Mr. Foote who opened in the Minor. His no|velty was now pretty much over, and out of his own eccentric pieces, little merit could be a&s;cribed to him.</P>
<P>The early part of this &s;ea&s;on, introduced to the public a very re&s;pectable character: a Mr. Atkins made his entre at Smock-alley, in Sir John Loverule. Being a painter, machini&s;t, and harlequin, he that winter brought out a panto|mime entertainment, called Harlequin's Funeral, which was liked, and brought &s;ome money.</P>
<P>Some years after, Mr. Atkins commenced country manager, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his circuit in the north of Ireland. His winter re&s;idence is chiefly at Belfa&s;t, where he has lately erected a beautiful elegant theatre, and &s;ome years ago, another at Londonderry. The&s;e with Armagh, and Li&s;burn, form a regular circuit for the year, and every encomium is due to Mr. Atkins, for his conduct, character, and management.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="123">Although Mr. Barry's re&s;ources were nearly exhau&s;ted, yet altogether his company &s;eemed &s;uperior to Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's. His tragedies were more uniformly &s;upported, as will be &s;een by the following view of both companies.</P>

<P><HI>I have not been able to obtain complete li&s;t of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's company this &s;ea|&s;on, but the above were the principals.</HI></P>
<P>But the greate&s;t &s;upport Mr. Barry received this &s;ea&s;on, was from the dramatic ma&s;que of King Arthur, which was performed, for the fir&s;t time in Ireland, under his au&s;pices. This piec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="111" REF="125">
was got up with great care and attention; the paintings were executed, in the fir&s;t &s;tyle, by Carver; the machinery, by Me&s;&s;ink, and Finny.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic of king Arthur alone, immortaliz|ed the great Purcell; it proved him the fir&s;t com|po&s;er of the age. No expence was &s;pared in cloaths and decorations. The dances to this piece al&s;o, added much to its beauty, and were executed in the be&s;t &s;tile.</P>
<P>It was brought out February 7th, 1763, in a manner that would have done honour to any &s;tage. The effect it produced was equal to the pains be&s;towed upon it. The pulic was charmed with its repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic, at this time, began to make &s;ome pro|gre&s;s in this kingdom. It had always been cul|tivated, but in an inferior degree. Hitherto, it had been con&s;idered as an auxiliary to the theatre, but we &s;hall &s;oon find it beginning to take the lead, and con&s;tituting a principal fea|ture in it's amu&s;ements.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="126">During the pa&s;&s;ion week, in April, 1763, oratorios were performed at Crow-&s;treet theatre, under the direction of Signior Pa&s;&s;erini, who had vi&s;ited Dublin the preceding year.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing after &s;ea&s;on, 1763, was memor|able for the number of London performers en|gaged by Mr. Barry. Mr. Shuter, Mr. Dyer, Mrs. Clive, Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Luke Sparks, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, and the celebrated Nancy Daw&s;on. Such a number of capital performers, was a great acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, and kept the theatre open till Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>At this very advanced period, was the comic opera of Love in a Village, fir&s;t brought out in this kingdom. It had been performed at Covent-garden, for a number of nights, the preceding winter, with that great &s;ucce&s;s and applau&s;e, it &s;o highly merited.</P>
<P>In the infancy, as I may &s;tile it, of the Engli&s;h vocal drama, the appearance of this beautiful opera attracted the attention, not only of the mu&s;ical cogno&s;centi, but al&s;o of all ranks and degrees. It made an impre&s;&s;ion, unknown &s;ince the days of Gay, and the Beggar's Opera, which
<PB N="113" REF="127">
till then had &s;tood unrivalled, but was now obliged to behold a very formidable competitor.</P>
<P>Indeed, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it my opinion, that, though many excellent operas have &s;ince been pre&s;ented to the public, yet none have been more intitled to their approbation, than Love in a Village.</P>
<P>This opera was capitally &s;upported, Young Meadows, Mr. Mahon; Ju&s;tice Woodcock, Mr. Shuter; Hawthorn, Mr. Wilder; Eu&s;tace, Mr. Dyer, (How few of our mu&s;ical gentlemen, of equal ability, would now play &s;uch a character,) Hodge, Mr. Glover; Sir William Meadows, Mr. Morris; Cook, Mr. Me&s;&s;ink; Mrs. Debo|rah Woodcock, Mi&s;s Ma&s;on; Lucinda, Mrs. Mahon; Madge, Mi&s;s Willis; and Ro&s;etta, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham; a double hornpipe by Mr. Sling&s;by, and Nancy Daw&s;on.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to &s;uch &s;trength, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op produced Mrs. Abington, who&s;e popularity ren|dered her at this time a welcome vi&s;itor; but who not being &s;o well &s;upported as &s;he ought, had not&punc; con&s;equently, &s;o much attraction.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE vice regal favour, which had on &s;o many occa&s;ions, been of infinite &s;ervice to the theatre-royal, operated, at the beginning of the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, very powerfully. The new Lord Lieutenant and his Lady, the Earl and Counte&s;s of Northumberland, were ju&s;t arrived, and very popular. The theatre opened, October, 1763, a few days after they commanded Othelio, with the Virgin Unma&s;ked; and very often dur|ing the winter, honoured it with their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="130">In this place, I cannot help remarking, the to tho&s;e chief governors who court popularity, no place can pre&s;ent a better opportunity of at|taining it, than the theatre. Through the cour&s;e of this work, I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the more popular the Lord Lieutenant was, the oftener he frequented the theatre.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Barry's principal reliance was on his engagement with Mr. Sheridan, who&s;e abilities and many virtues had ju&s;tly endeared him to the public. This much injured gentleman, was at this time induced once more to revi&s;it his native country. He had, during his ab&s;ence, the honour of being preceptor to the queen, and had obtained a pen&s;ion from his maje&s;ty, which had rendered his circum&s;tances &s;omewhat ea&s;ier. He now returned with hopes, that the public, &s;en&s;ible of the wrongs he had &s;uffered, might devi&s;e &s;ome means of recompenceing him.</P>
<P>Still more to weaken the adver&s;e party, Mr. Barry had the addre&s;s to bring over once more to his &s;tandard Mrs. Fitzhenry. The la&s;t three years &s;he had &s;pent at Smock-alley. Her return was of great &s;ervice, and it might then be &s;aid
<PB N="117" REF="131">
that Crow-&s;treet could exhibit tragedies, worthy the attention of the public, &s;upported by Barry, Sheridan, Reddi&s;h, Heaphy, Jeffer&s;on, Mrs. Fitzhenry, Mi&s;s O&s;borne, then Mrs. William Barry, and Mrs. Dancer.</P>
<P>In comedy, they could not boa&s;t &s;o much; Mrs. Kennedy, from Drury-lane, was excellent in a peculiar line of characters; &s;uch as the Old Maid, Mrs. Honeycombe, &amp;c. but neither her age nor figure qualified her to lead in elegant comedy. Mr. Barry's greate&s;t &s;trength in that line was Mr. Wilkin&s;on. The late excur&s;ions of this gentleman to Ireland, had proved &s;o plea|&s;ant and profitable, that we find him early this &s;ea&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much attraction, and draw|ing money to Mr. Foote's pieces, particulary his Mayor of Garret, which was then fir&s;t brought out in Dublin, and performed &s;everal nights.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkin&s;on's engagement, ended in January, 1764; when, after an excellent bene|fit, he &s;et off for Scotland; and Mr. Macklin having joined Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, the remainder of the &s;ea&s;on, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> had entirely
<PB N="118" REF="132">
the a&s;cendancy, and that very few comedies were played in Crow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Early in November, Mrs. Fitzhenry opened in Cali&s;ta, and a few nights after, Mr. Sheridan came forward in Hamlet, a character he had &s;u&s;tained with the greate&s;t re&s;pectability, both in London and Dublin. The fir&s;t actre&s;&s;es then, did not think it beneath them give force and dignity to the Queen. Mrs. Pritchard played it in London, Mrs. Fitzhenry in Dublin. The hou&s;e was crowded to receive Mr. Sheridan, and the reiterated applau&s;es which marked his fir&s;t entrance, evidently &s;poke the feelings of the audience on the return of a man, whom the world ju&s;tly con&s;idered as an ornament to the &s;tage, and an honour to the kingdom that gave him birth.</P>
<P>His next appearance was in Richard, which was graced with the pre&s;ence of the Lord Lieutenant and his Counte&s;s. After this, the two tragedians combined their &s;trength, and played Pierre, and Jaffier, Brutus, and Caffius, King John, and the Ba&s;tard, Ha&s;tings, and Shore, Othello, and Iago, De&s;demona, Mrs. Dancer; Emelia, Mrs. Fitzhenry; Ca&s;|talio,
<PB N="119" REF="133">
and Chamont. In many tragedies, we find the four: as All for Love, Marc Antony, and Ventidius, Octavia, and Cleopatra, Ore&s;tes, and Pyrrhus, Andromache, and Hermione, Alexander, and Clytus, Roxana, and Statira. The Penitent, Horatio, Mr. Sheridan; Sciolto, Mr. Heaphy; Altamont, Mr. T. Barry; Lothario, Mr. Barry, Lavinia, Mrs. T. Barry; Cali&s;ta, Mrs. Fitzhenry.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on, bu&s;ine&s;s beginning to decline, Mr. Barry engaged a company, of Italian Burletta performers, who opened the 28th of April, by command, with the Burletta of La Serva Padrona, or the Maid the Mi&s;tre&s;s. The characters, by Signor and Signora Guerina, &amp;c. but, I believe, the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e Burletta's was but very moderate, and &s;carcely an&s;wered the expence attending them.</P>
<P>'Tis now time to take a view of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's operations. He judiciou&s;ly, &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of the power of his competitor in tragedy; there|fore, in&s;tead of encountering him in the line where his principal &s;trength lay, lie directed the force of his own operations to comedy and mu|&s;ical pieces. His retaining Mrs. Abington, and
<PB N="120" REF="134">
Mr. Ryder, and his junction with Mr. Macklin, were of great &s;ervice to him in the former; and fortune pointed out an object, which abundantly an&s;wered his purpo&s;e, in the latter.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Catley's vocal powers, and uncommon abilities, were then ju&s;t beginning to captivate the public, in London. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op invited her over to this kingdom, and &s;he arrived late in December, 1763. Her fir&s;t appearance was in Polly, in the Beggar's Opera, in which the ap|plau&s;e &s;he gained was uncommon. She plea&s;ed beyond expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o highly e&s;tabli&s;hed her fame, that even in the en&s;uing Chri&s;tmas holi|days, the mo&s;t unfa&s;hionable part of the &s;ea&s;on, the hou&s;es were crowded each night, with the fir&s;t auditors in the kingdom, to her Polly.</P>
<P>Opera now began to rear her head, and take the lead in the attractions of the drama; and &s;he has ever &s;ince retained this powerful charm, in a very &s;uperior degree. Mi&s;s Catley in&s;tant|ly became a decided favourite. The Beggar's Opera was often repeated, and her Ro&s;etta, in
<PB N="121" REF="135">
Love in a Village, drew much money to the theatrical trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, although his genius did not, by any means, incline to the laughter loving godde&s;s, had yet &s;elected an excellent comedy com|pany. With Mrs. Abington, Mr. Macklin, Mr. Ryder, Mr. Dexter, Mrs. Le&s;&s;ingham, from Covent-garden, who had played a few nights in the latter &s;ea&s;on at Crow-&s;treet, Mr. Stamper, Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Kelf, Mi&s;s Ambro&s;e, Mi&s;s U&s;her, Mr. Walker, &amp;c. many comedies were performed with much credit.</P>
<P>Few particulars of this &s;ea&s;on remain worth noticing; one, however, was attended with circum&s;tances too &s;hocking, to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>On one of the crowded nights, at Crow-&s;treet, in the month of April, 1764, two gentlemen, leading &s;ome ladies to their chairs, were gro&s;sly in&s;ulted by a number of &s;ervants, waiting at the box doors, who not only abu&s;ed them in the foule&s;t manner, but followed them on their re|turn into the box room, till prevented by the centinels then on duty. Not content with outrage,
<PB N="122" REF="136">
a number of them, threw their lighted flambeaux, into the box room, crying out at the &s;ame time, fire! fire!</P>
<P>Such an outery, joined to the &s;moke of the flambeaux, occa&s;ioned an in&s;tantaneous terror, ea&s;ier to be imagined, than de&s;cribed. Perhaps there is not a more alarming circum&s;tance in na|ture, than that of upwards of a thou&s;and people, confined in a theatre, being terrified with the &s;udden exclamation of fire, without knowing from whence the danger ari&s;es, or how to avoid it. Terror magnifies the mo&s;t petty trifles into objects of alarm, and fear takes from people the power of pur&s;uing proper mea&s;ures for their &s;afety.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation this alarm excited, in&s;tantly communicated it&s;elf to every individual in the hou&s;e. The cry of fire re&s;ounded from every part of the theatre. The cries and &s;hrieks of the females, and the efforts of the men to extricate them&s;elves, from this &s;uppo&s;ed danger, produc|ed a &s;cene truly terrific, and &s;hocking. The hou&s;e was cleared as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The mi&s;|take was di&s;covered, but not till a great deal of mi&s;chief had happened.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="137">Numberle&s;s were the accidents this wicked contrivance produced. Happily however, only two lives were lo&s;t. Tho&s;e were, Mr. Eaton, a Butcher of Ormond Market, and his wife, who were trampled to death, by the violent pre&s;&s;ure of the crowd from the upper gallery. What added to the poignancy of the di&s;tre&s;s was, they left behind them eight children, totally unpro|vided for!</P>
<P>Where there are proper objects, the public is never deficient in compa&s;&s;ion, and humanity. On this occa&s;ion, they embraced every oppor|tunity of manife&s;ting this goodlike di&s;po&s;ition. A benefit, free of every expence, was announced at each theatre. Every performer of con&s;e|quence came forward, and was eager to offer his &s;ervices. Each night was crowded; be|&s;ides which, there was a &s;ub&s;cription &s;et on foot, which altogether rai&s;ed a &s;um that provided very re&s;pectably for the&s;e unhappy orphans, thus be|reft of their parents.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, who &s;till laboured under dif|ficulties, which his former misfortunes had in|volved him in, having nearly fini&s;hed his engage|ment with Mr. Barry, propo&s;ed giving lectures
<PB N="124" REF="138">
on oratory, and the Engli&s;h language, in the Mu&s;ic Hall, early in May. This his creditors, ungenerou&s;ly, and injudiciou&s;ly, prevented him from; and he was obliged to acquaint the pub|lic, that though he had appropriated three fourths of his income to the di&s;charge of his debts, yet &s;uch was their cruelty, that the &s;afety of his per&s;on would have been endangered if he had ventured to go on with his lecture.</P>
<P>In June, 1764, Mr. Shuter again vi&s;ited Dublin, and appeared in &s;everal of his favourite characters, at Smock-alley, which with his &s;up|port, kept open till the beginning of Augu&s;t, during which time, Love in a Village, Thomas and Sally, Comus, The Devil to Pay, &amp;c. were often repeated.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry, notwith&s;tanding his exertion after an un&s;ucce&s;sful campaign, clo&s;ed in June, leaving Mr. Mo&s;&s;op in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field, and repaired, as u&s;ual, to Cork and Limerick, where he experienced better fortune; which the ex|cellence of his company highly entitled him to as many be &s;een by the following bill.</P>

<P>A circum&s;tance happened, at this time, which contributed towards rai&s;ing the popularity of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op. The triennial perambulation of the city liberties, or riding the franchi&s;es, as they were then &s;tiled, was &s;o much the fa&s;hion, that on tho&s;e occa&s;ions the different corporations went to very great expence, in preparing the decorations and paraphernalia, which di&s;tingui&s;h|ed their re&s;pective bodies; and tho&s;e only who have been &s;pectators of the magnificence, no|velty, variety, and &s;plendour, of this &s;ingular

cavalcade, can be proper judges of the effects it produced.</P>
<P>From the great variety of dre&s;&s;es which the wardrobe of a theatre mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;i&s;t of, it was always in a managers power, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a peculiar manner &s;uch repre&s;entations; and &s;o amply did Mr. Mo&s;&s;op contribute to the brillian|cy and pageantry, of the pre&s;ent, that &s;everal of the corporations returned their acknowledg|ments to him in the public papers, <Q>for lend|ing them habits, ornaments, and decorati|ons which added con&s;iderably to the &s;plendour of the franchi&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion al&s;o, the Right Honourable William Forbes, then Lord Mayor, and in high favour with the city, de&s;ired a play, Augu&s;t 14th, <HI>For the entertainment of the Alder|men, the Sheriffs, and the Ma&s;ter, Wardens, and Brethren of the city of Dublin.</HI></P>

<P>Smock-Alley theatre opened, October 15th. with Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's Richard, and Mr. Ryder's Scapin. But as their hopes re&s;ted chiefly on mu|&s;ical performances&punc; the Beggar's Opera, with new accompaniments, by Signior Giordani, was next brought forward, which, with Love in a Village, and the new Burletta, were performed ternately, &s;ix or &s;even nights each. The bur|letta plea&s;ed much; Spiletta was a great favour|ite; but Catley's voice, and whim&s;ical &s;tile of
<PB N="133" REF="147">
&s;inging, &s;oon took the lead, and drew crowded hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. Collins, whom the public have lately be|held with infinite plea&s;ure, entertaining an au|dience for three hours, entirely by the force of genuine humour, and native comic talents, made his fir&s;t appearance on the boards of Smock-alley, in Young Mirabel, in the incon|&s;tant, and proved a very re&s;pectable acqui&s;ition to the Iri&s;h &s;tage. I find his name afterwards, for Ju&s;tice Woodcock, Dick in the Confederacy, Peachum, Sir Francis Wronghead, Ba&s;tard in Lear, Angelo, Gibby, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The early part of Mr. Barry's &s;ea&s;on proved rather profitable. To the novelty of the Ve|netians, and rope dancing, he prefixed his &s;tronge&s;t tragedies. His receipts were encrea&s;ed, but his expences were enormous. When public curio&s;ity abated, he had recour&s;e to a &s;tratagem, which, as it was attacking the enemy on their own ground, an&s;wered his purpo&s;e, equal to his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations.</P>
<P>The rage for Catley was this time &s;o great, that it was highly expedient to endeavour to
<PB N="134" REF="148">
&s;tem the torrent. Con&s;cious that his mu&s;ical performers were not equal to tho&s;e of Smock-alley, he boldly announced the Beggar's Opera, Captain Macheath by him&s;elf; Polly by Mrs. Dancer; and Lucy by Mrs. Abington. The novelty of the attempt, excited the curio&s;ity of the public, and it drew much money.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that though his vocal abilities could not enable him to compa&s;s the common tunes of this well known piece, yet his figure, manner, and acting of this intrepid highwayman, made ample amends, and perhaps, he altoge|ther gave a portrait of this favourite character, equal, if not &s;uperior, to any that ever attempted it, &s;ince the original. He really was, the &s;ine, gay, bold faced, gentleman of the road.</P>
<P>Gay's Polly received from Mrs. Dancer, a delicacy, a pathos, and intere&s;ting colouring which few vocal performers have ever been able to give it. Mrs. Abington's Lucy, was e&s;teem|ed a capital piece of acting.</P>
<P>The remaining parts of the opera were &s;up|ported, in the following manner: Peachum,
<PB N="135" REF="149">
Mr. Macklin; Lockit, Mr. Sparks; Mat o'th' Mint, Mr. Mahon; Jenny Diver, Mrs. Mahon; Mrs. Peachum, Mrs. Kennedy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night, it brought 160<HI>l.</HI> the &s;econd 125 <HI>l.</HI> the third 50<HI>l.</HI> the fourth 120<HI>l.</HI> the fifth 97<HI>l.</HI> It was afterwards performed &s;everal nights, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, with varied &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e this new, and unexpected &s;troke, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op thought of another, equally nou|velle. Mi&s;s Catley, had then got &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the public, that whatever &s;he attempted, was &s;ure to meet with uncommon approbation. She had long drawn hou&s;es in Polly. She now a&s;&s;umed the oppo&s;ite character, and figured in the raki&s;h, joyous Macheath.</P>
<P>This had the de&s;ired effect, and excited cu|rio&s;ity in a very high degree, and the Beggar's Opera proved another &s;ource of di&s;pute and con|tention, at Smock-alley; Mr. Collins played Peachum; Mr. Wilder, Mat o'th' Mint; Mrs. Wilder, Lucy; Mr. Rider, Mrs. Slammakin; Mrs. U&s;her, Diana Trapes, and Mi&s;s Dunlop, Polly. It was, with Love in a Village, given
<PB N="136" REF="150">
once a week during mo&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on. The former was played fifteen nights: the latter, ten.</P>
<P>Mrs. Abington's return to Smock-alley theatre, about the middle of the &s;ea&s;on, cau&s;ed a new revolution in the Beggar's Opera; &s;he played Polly, and Signiora Spiletta appeared in Lucy.</P>
<P>The latter was indeed an arduous ta&s;k. Being almo&s;t unacquainted with the language, &s;he was obliged to apologize to the public, before &s;he performed it. But favourites often have a li|cence to be ab&s;urd, and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, Spiletta got more applau&s;e, than if &s;he had been a native.</P>
<P>Scarce were the merits of this mu&s;ical &s;trugg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> decided, when the comic opera of the Maid of the Mill, gave occa&s;ion for a fre&s;h conte&s;t. This excellent opera was then performing, with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, at Covent-garden.</P>
<P>Both managers thought it an object, worth their utmo&s;t attention. The words of the opera were publi&s;hed, and equally free for both. But
<PB N="137" REF="151">
the mu&s;ic was in manu&s;cript, and the &s;ole pro|perty of the Covent-garden manager. From him Mr. Barry purcha&s;ed it, and con&s;equently imagined, he had in this in&s;tance, &s;ecurely tri|umphed over his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op found an un|expected re&s;ource, in the great abilities of Sig|nior Giordani. It is a fact well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that though the parts were writing out in Dublin for Mr. Barry, yet did Signior Giordani &s;it down, and new compo&s;e the entire opera of the Maid of the Mill, in full &s;core, with all the accompaniments, in le&s;s than a fortnight: and it was written out, &s;tudied, the &s;cenes painted, and the opera brought out, two nights before they were able to accompli&s;h it at Crow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The opera plea&s;ed much. The mu&s;ic did in|finite credit to the genius of Signior Giordani. It was con&s;idered, by every judge, as a wonder|ful effort of the human mind: and to it were applied Pope's words,</P>
<P>"The &s;ound becomes an echo to the &s;en&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="152">I &s;hould imagine, it will add to the entertain|ment of the reader, to compare the &s;trength of each company, in &s;upporting the pieces in que&s;|tion. The Maid of the Mill was thus perform|ed, at each theatre.</P>

<P>At Smock-alley, the Maid of the Mill, ran nine nights, be&s;ides benefits. At Crow-&s;treet, they gave up the conte&s;t after the fifth time.</P>
<P>Much about this period, the &s;erious opera of Artaxerxes, was, for the fir&s;t time, performed in this kingdom, at Smock-alley; Arbaces, by
<PB N="139" REF="153">
Signior Pa&s;&s;erini; Artaxerxes, Signior Peretti; Artabanes, Mr. Wilder; Rimenes, Mr. Ryder; Semira, Mrs. Hawtrcy; and Mandane, Mi&s;s Catley.</P>
<P>We may judge of the &s;trength of the mu&s;ical pieces this &s;ea&s;on, under Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, when we find the Beggar's Opera exhibited eleven nights, Love in a Village &s;ixteen, Artaxerxes fourteen; be&s;ides the Maid of the Mill, Comus, the Jovial Crew, and the Italian Burlettas.</P>
<P>Catley clo&s;ed her career, the 4th of May, in Ro&s;etta, after which &s;he &s;ailed for England, being announced as engaged for the next winter, with her pre&s;ent manager, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op. Her departure put an end to the mu&s;ical pieces.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op clo&s;ed the 19th of May, inform|ing the public, that he intended opening &s;peedi|ly again, with Engli&s;h operas, having engaged &s;everal capital &s;ingers from England.</P>
<P>It is time now to return to Mr. Barry. Hard pu&s;hed by the vocal powers of his opponents, and burthened with a very heavy company, he found his finances much impaired; towards
<PB N="140" REF="154">
the end of this hard-fought campaign. Fortune however, &s;eemed more propitious, when he confined his efforts within their proper &s;phere.</P>
<P>The tragedy of the Counte&s;&s; of Sali&s;bury was, at this time, offered to his acceptance. The author was a native of this kingdom, a gentle|man of good connections; and the piece po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed much merit. The language was flowery, the &s;tory which was founded on Dr. Leland's Lang&s;word Earl of Sali&s;bury, pathetic and in|tere&s;ting. It was got up with care, and met with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Sali&s;bury was well adapted to di&s;play the pow|ers of Mr. Barry; and Mrs. Dancer, in the ori|ginal part of the Counte&s;s, exhibited tho&s;e amazing abilities, which have &s;o often &s;ince, enraptured the admirers of melpom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, and which have &s;o de&s;ervedly placed her at the very pinnacle of theatric excellence.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury was performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nights, though brought out &s;o late in the &s;ea&s;on, and Mr. Barry fini&s;hed in July. Sali&s;bury was afterwards acted in the Hay-market, and Drury-lane.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="155">A few days after, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, according to his promi&s;e, brough out his fir&s;t new Engli&s;h opera, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;tile it. This was Amintas, or the Royal Shepherd, in which the celebrated Signior Tenducci, &s;o much admired in the mu&s;ical world, fir&s;t appeared. Alex|ander was performed by Signior Perretti, Age|nor, Mr. Wilder; Thamyris, Mi&s;s Thomas, from Covent-garden, and Eliza by Signiora Cremonini, from the Opera hou&s;e, their fir&s;t appearance in this kingdom.</P>
<P>The uncommon vocal powers, and judgment, of Signior Tenducci, had already rai&s;ed his fame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t of the courts in Europe; nor did his me|rits make le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion in Dublin. He was allowed to be, by far the mo&s;t capital foreign &s;inger, that ever vi&s;ited the&s;e kingdoms, and his reception was &s;o flattering, that we find him em|bracing every opportunity of returning to this country.</P>
<P>Amintas and Alexander, were the only opera's performed at this time: but the&s;e were repeated twice a week, during the &s;ummer, and clo&s;ed the beginning of October.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="156">In the interim, Mr. Barry was with a very capital company, performing at Cork, where, unrivalled, he gained reputation and profit.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o another very &s;trong detach|ment at this time at Drogheda. Among&s;t the principal performers were, Mr. Macklin, Mr. Ryder, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Au&s;tin, Mrs. Kelf, Mrs. Au&s;tin, &amp;c.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER a few weeks interval, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op commenced the operations of his next campaign with vigour, and opened October 21&s;t, 1765, with Mi&s;s Catley in Macheath; Polly, Mi&s;s Thomas, a new Lucy; and Mr. Ryder's Scapin.</P>
<P>Tenducci's operas were continued, with a very moderate &s;hare of &s;ucce&s;s, and a crowd of new performers imported or recruited from the country: as Mrs. Pear&s;on, Mr. Tyler, Mr.
<PB N="144" REF="158">
Pear&s;on, Mr. Richards, Mr. and Mrs. Gemea, Mr. Smith, Mr. Bli&s;&s;et, afterwards an actor of much merit.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the group, unnoticed and unknown, was Mr. Edwin, who in Sir Philip Modelove, fir&s;t courted the acquaintance of the Iri&s;h au|dience. Long were the abilities of this eccen|tric actor ob&s;cured, nor could the profounde&s;t dramatic judge then di&s;cover tho&s;e talents, which nature had &s;o liberally endowed him with; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the extraordinary eminence he after|wards atta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned. Mr. Edwin was, at that time very young. He remained here two &s;ea&s;ons, and we find him in Old Philpot, Lord Trinket, Ju&s;tice Woodcock, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This &s;ea&s;on Mr. and Mrs. Reddi&s;h changed &s;ides and, with Mr. Glover, went over to Smock-alley. So much in fa&s;hion indeed was the cu&s;tom, at this time, of performers chang|ing from one manager to another, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible with accuracy to follow them through their various theatrical tran&s;itions.</P>
<P>Operas &s;till continued entirely the fa&s;hion at Smock-alley, and drew con&s;iderable &s;ums to Mr.
<PB N="145" REF="159">
Mo&s;&s;op's trea&s;ury. The new opera of Athridates, run upwards of a dozen nights.</P>
<P>In this piece, Mi&s;s A&s;hmore, &s;ince Mrs. Sparks, was fir&s;t introduced to the public; &s;he &s;ung a plea&s;ing air, of "Deare&s;t Mother," much adapted to her powers, and in which &s;he was well in&s;tructed by Signior Tenducci. The au|dience were highly delighted with this new little favourite, who &s;ome years afterwards, charmed them in a variety of characters.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of the &s;ea&s;on, like many others, &s;he changed &s;ides; and played Cupid in King Arthur, at Crow-&s;treet; &s;he there had part of a benefit, at which &s;he appeared in the Virgin Unma&s;ked.</P>
<P>It was with the utmo&s;t concern, Mr. Barry perceived his opponent crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, which his utmo&s;t exertions could not prevent. The credit and reputation of his theatre, had been for a long time gradually le&s;&s;ening, and the certain con&s;equences appeared; &s;alaries unpaid, and debts contracted, which he had not ability to di&s;charge.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="160">Thus di&s;agreeably &s;ituated, he embraced an expedient which, though it procured him temporary relief, was attended with reproach and di&s;grace to the theatre. He introduced a new &s;et of performers to the town. The&s;e were no other than Dutch dogs, and an Italian mon|key, who, in a new pantomime, di&s;played tho&s;e tricks which ought &s;olely to be confined to their proper &s;phere, a booth, where &s;en&s;e and rea|&s;on are &s;et at defiance, and where an admir|er of the drama would be a&s;hamed to appear.</P>
<P>Nor were the common arts of oppo&s;ition left untried. Performers, allured by empty promi&s;es, and imaginary honour, were continually chang|ing their &s;ituation: and be&s;ides Mi&s;s A&s;hmore, whom I have ju&s;t mentioned, Mr. and Mrs. Reddi&s;h, Mi&s;s Slack, Signiora Spiletta, Ten|ducci, Cremonini, with &s;everal others were en|ticed from Smock-alley to Crow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The novelty of Tenducci, and the foreigners, was nearly exhau&s;ted; whil&s;t the attractions of Catley, who adhered with honour to Mr. Mo&s;|&s;op, encrea&s;ed every night. She had at this time, nearly arrived at the zenith of her reputa|tion
<PB N="147" REF="161">
and I believe I may venture to affirm, that &s;he drew as much money to the Iri&s;h theatre, as any vocal performer ever did, either before or &s;ince; nor did &s;he confine her&s;elf to one line of &s;inging. She played Polly, Macheath, and Lucy. She relinqui&s;hed Sally, and made a capital part of Dorcas, and gave up, what few capital &s;ingers would, Ro&s;etta, and played Deborah Wood|cock.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, and I am afraid unenter|taining to my readers, to enter into the miniutiae of each theatre; &s;uffice it then to mention merely, what may &s;erve to convey to them a ju&s;t idea of the more e&s;&s;ential and important articles.</P>
<P>The following anecdote was given me from re|&s;pectable authority, and is now mentioned as a proof that actors are not always the be&s;t judges of pieces. Notwith&s;tanding the uncommon merit, and extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s of the Clande&s;tine Marriage, the early part of this &s;ea&s;on at Drury Lane; a piece which one &s;hould imagine, only &s;lightly to peru&s;e, were &s;ufficient to make any reader of common under&s;tanding, pronounce it one of the be&s;t comedies in the Engli&s;h language; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et &s;trange to relate, at the fir&s;t reading of it
<PB N="148" REF="162">
in the Green Room of Crow-&s;treet, in Decem|ber, the whole company concurred in opinion, that it was not worth the trouble of getting up.</P>
<P>It was accordingly laid a&s;ide, unil Mr. T. Barry's benefit. The novelty inclined him to have it &s;tudied, and performed; when it plea&s;ed &s;o wonderfully, that it was played twice a week at Cork the following &s;ummer, and many nights the en&s;uing winter.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ea&s;on, I mu&s;t mention the death of Mr. Lewis Duval, the original pro|prietor of the Smock Alley theatre, and who, until his death, which was when he was up|wards of ninety, had an annual benefit at that theatre.</P>
<P>Though much embarra&s;&s;ed, yet not entirely di&s;heartened, by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the two la&s;t campaigns, Mr. Barry once more prepared to meet his competitor for public favour, and &s;eemed to take the field with a force &s;uperior to that of his adver&s;ary, as may be &s;een by the &s;ub|joined li&s;t.</P>

<P>From a view of the above, one would be apt to imagine that the advantage lay on Mr. Barry's &s;ide, but in reality it was the rever&s;e; every effort of his at the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, whil&s;t Catley brought crowded hou&s;es at the other theatre.</P>
<P>In this exigence Mr. Barry turned his eyes towards Mr. Sheridan, with whom he conclud|ed a treaty, and who on this occa&s;ion was of great &s;ervice. By accident it happens, that the receipts of Mr. Sheridan's fir&s;t four hou&s;es, are
<PB N="151" REF="165">
in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which for the readers informa|tion, I am happy to a&s;certain.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t premi&s;e that at this period the bu&s;ine&s;s in general was very bad.

<P>I am &s;orry it is not in my power to follow him through the remainder of his characters, but, by the above &s;pecimen we may readily perceive that he contributed much towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Mr. Barry's &s;hattered finances; but even with this extraordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance it was not in his power to &s;ave him&s;elf, and at the con|clu&s;ion of the winter, he found he was more involved than ever.</P>
<P>Few occurrences worth mentioning happened, at either theatre, during the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op &s;till pre&s;erved the &s;uperiority he had obtained, though in truth, he had very little rea&s;on to boa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="166">Among&s;t the new performers he introduced&punc; at this time, was Mi&s;s Browne, daughter of Mr. Sowdon: an elegant figure, a plea&s;ing &s;inger, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much merit, both in tragedy and comedy; &s;he played Polly &s;ix nights, then Ro&s;etta, Patty, Fanny, in the Clande&s;tine Mar|riage, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This lady afterwards became the wife of Mr. Jack&s;on, a gentleman of abilities, as a writer and actor, and of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable character, who made his fir&s;t appearance in Dublin much about the &s;ame time, with de&s;erved repu|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Jack&s;on remained in Dublin &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons, and &s;u&s;tained a principal line of bu&s;ine&s;s, in the varied walks of the drama, with much credit. Some years after, Mr. Jack|&s;on purcha&s;ed the Edinburgh theatre and patent from Mr. Ro&s;s, the then patentee, where he continued manager untill very lately, with much credit and character.</P>
<P>About this period, Mr. George Alexander Stevens, for the fir&s;t time, vi&s;ited this kingdom, with his celebrated Lecture upon Heads, and
<PB N="153" REF="167">
exhibited in the Little Theatre in Capel-&s;treet, with infinite applau&s;e. The novelty of his un|dertaking drew the attention of the public.</P>
<P>Though not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much merit as an actor, yet he certainly delivered his lectures with va&s;t humour, variety, and judgment; repu|tation and &s;ucce&s;s attended him in both king|doms, and in the cour&s;e of a few years, he ac|quired an independant fortune, &s;olely by the re|petition of this then &s;ingular &s;pecies of enter|tainment.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT every circum&s;tance now &s;eemed to in|dicate the rapid decline of the drama in Ireland. Novelty in a great mea&s;ure, had lo&s;t its charms; rancour, and ill will, prevailed among&s;t the performers. The town was divided, and ex|hau&s;ted between the Barryi&s;ts and Mo&s;&s;opians. Both parties were heartily tired of the conte&s;t, yet neither were willing to re&s;ign their preten|&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="169">The very great merits of the two managers procured them a number of zealous partizans, but the&s;e were not &s;ufficient to &s;upport their re&s;pective theatres. The few moderate and di&s;cerning, beheld with concern, the ruin that attended the Dublin &s;tage, from the&s;e divi&s;ions, yet knew not how to remedy an evil, which every day's experience encrea&s;ed, and rendered more apparent.</P>
<P>At length, the &s;uperior genius of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op prevailed. After a &s;even years conte&s;t, Mr. Bar|ry was obliged to re&s;ign the field to his then &s;eemingly, more fortunate rival; having, during that time, experienced more chagrin, vexation, and di&s;appointment, than imagination can well conceive. Harra&s;&s;ed in mind and body, he had lavi&s;hed &s;o many years of the prime of his life, and, in&s;tead of reaping the fruits of &s;uch &s;hining abilities, as nature had ble&s;&s;ed him with, had incurred debts he could never di&s;charge, ruined many per&s;ons connected with him, and involved him&s;elf in difficulties, which during the remain|der of his life, he could never &s;urmount.</P>
<P>His, I c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnot call him &s;ucce&s;sful, competitor, was not in a much more enviable &s;ituation. His
<PB N="156" REF="170">
finances were al&s;o much deranged, his credit im|paired, and his re&s;ources nearly exhau&s;ted. However, he had the town now to him&s;elf, and he hoped that having accompli&s;hed &s;o important a point, a few &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ea&s;ons would amply recompen&s;e him for the many di&s;agreeable days he had &s;pent in the endeavour to effect it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he took, was to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both theatres, which, as he imagined, &s;truck at the root of all future rival&s;hip, and gave him lei&s;ure to recruit his &s;hattered fortunes.</P>
<P>He played about a month in Smock-alley, whil&s;t Crow-&s;treet was repairing, where he was aided by the novelty of Mrs. Fitzhenry, who&s;e return from London was welcomed by her na|tive audience, with that warmth and cordiality, which evinced how dear &s;he was to them, and how high &s;he &s;tood in their e&s;timation.</P>
<P>The 7th of December, 1767, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op came forward, for the fir&s;t time, as &s;ole mo|narch of Crow-&s;treet domains, in the cha|racter of Richard the Third. Curio&s;ity how|ever, did not produce the effect expected. The
<PB N="157" REF="171">
hou&s;e was far from being crowded: the receipts amounting only to 82<HI>l.</HI> 15<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> Iri&s;h money.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;everal of his tragedies brought large &s;ums of money to his trea&s;ury. The Orphan of China, in particular, one night reached 140<HI>l.</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Brown, ever a favourite with the public, was well attended, in his principal characters in comedy, and Mrs. Fitzhenry gave evident proofs, at her benefit, how re&s;pectable her in|tere&s;t was among&s;t all ranks. She took the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, and had 201<HI>l.</HI> 1<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> Iri&s;h, in her hou&s;e, which I believe, was as much as ever had then been known, on one night.</P>
<P>In the month of February, 1768, the tragedy of the Orphan was revived, for the purpo&s;e of introducing a young and new candidate for pub|lic favour. The character &s;elected for his fir&s;t appearance was Ca&s;talio, a favourite part of Mr. Barry's, and in which he had di&s;played &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s, tenderne&s;s, and variety. Arducus as the ta&s;k was, our adventurer exceeded the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of his friends, and im|pre&s;&s;ed the town with the mo&s;t lively hopes, that
<PB N="158" REF="172">
in this youthful hero, they had found an ex|cellent &s;ub&s;titute for their departed favourite.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity, and connections, drew numbers the fir&s;t night which amounted to 133<HI>l.</HI> 14<HI>s.</HI> 9<HI>d.</HI> and &s;o highly was the audience delighted with the performance of this promi&s;ing &s;on of The&s;pis, that the play, in the cour&s;e of a few weeks, drew a number of re&s;pectable audiences. His next attempts were Jaffier, Lothario, and E&s;&s;ex, which were attended with an equal degree of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Fame a length, proclaimed the name of this promi&s;ing actor to be Clinch, a young gentle|man of re&s;pectable family and connexions, and who had received a liberal education. The pub|lic certainly had every rea&s;on to expect a valu|able acqui&s;ition in him. Nature had been very bountiful. His figure was excellent, his face manly, and expre&s;&s;ive; his voice &s;trong, clear, impre&s;&s;ive, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great variety, and many of its tones bore a great re&s;emblance to their much loved Barry's.</P>
<P>Time has &s;ince proved their conjectures were well founded. The public are at pre&s;ent well
<PB N="159" REF="173">
acquainted with his various merits, and he is not only ju&s;tly con&s;idered as one of the principal ornaments of the Iri&s;h &s;tage, but al&s;o univer|&s;ally beloved and e&s;teemed, for the many virtues which adorn his private character.</P>
<P>Though in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op did not neglect pre&s;enting it with every novelty in his power; and none could be more accept|able than its darling Catley, who was engaged for &s;ix nights, and charmed once more with her mu&s;ical powers.</P>
<P>A Mr. Brownlow Forde, al&s;o made his appear|ance in Scrub, whil&s;t Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, by way of variety, for it certainly could not be for its ex|cellence, endeavoured to repre&s;ent the ea&s;y, elegant, fa&s;hionable Archer. Mr. Forde, after|wards played Sir Jo&s;eph Wittol, Bri&s;k, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, who at this time was deliver|ing his lectures at the Mu&s;ic-hall in Fi&s;hamble-&s;treet, was al&s;o prevailed on, towards the end of the &s;ea&s;on, to perform three of his principal characters; Hamlet, Richard, and Cato, at each of which times, he amply experienced
<PB N="160" REF="174">
a continuance of public patronage and fa|vour.</P>
<P>In the latter &s;ea&s;on, 1768, Mr. King and Mrs. Abington once more vi&s;ited this metropolis, and appeared in mo&s;t of their favourite charac|ters. The Lord Ogleby of Mr. King was then new, and exceedingly popular. It was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the fine&s;t pieces of acting, the world ever beheld.</P>
<P>For many years, I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing this truly excellent actor, in this part, and can with ju&s;tice affirm, that for correctne&s;s of conception, &s;pirit of execution, and in &s;hort, for every requi&s;ite to con&s;titute a fini&s;hed per|formance, I never beheld a more perfect re|pre&s;entation than his Lord Ogleby. The whim|&s;ical traits of the Old Man of Quality, debilitated by years and intemperance, yet retaining the inclinations, and affecting the vigour of youth, are by him exhibited with a &s;pirit and fidelity, which we have &s;eldom &s;een equalled. I &s;hall not dread correction, when I a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;tage, in all its various departments, cannot at pre&s;ent, produce better performance.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE following winter, 1768, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op re&s;olved to give novelty 'till it cloyed the appetite. The fir&s;t night, he pre&s;ented a new Polly and Lucy, in the Beggar's Opera. The former was a Mi&s;s Hud&s;on, the latter a Mi&s;s Reade; they both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a moderate &s;hare of merit, and were tolerably well received.</P>
<P>A few nights after, Mr. Cornely's made his debut in Ralph in the Maid of the Mill, and from his fir&s;t entr&egrave; &s;tamped an impre&s;&s;ion on the
<PB N="162" REF="176">
audience, which his merit afterwards amply confirmed.</P>
<P>Mr. Cornellys was followed by a Mr. Saun|ders, from Drury-lane, in Polonius, and Mrs. Wright in the Queen. The next night Mrs. Saunders, formerly Mi&s;s Reynolds, an actre&s;s of real intrin&s;ic merit, came forward in Violante in the Wonder, and Combru&s;h in the Hone&s;t York&s;hireman. The&s;e novelties how|ever, had no effect, and the theatre promi&s;ed to be unfa&s;hionable and unfrequented.</P>
<P>This unfavourable pro&s;pect made Mr. Mo&s;&s;op ha&s;ten his intended operations. In November, Mr. Foote's new comedy of The Devil upon Two Sticks was got up, on purpo&s;e to introduce this eccentric hero again to this kingdom. The fir&s;t night was commanded by the new and popular Lord Lieutenant, Lord Town&s;hend; the hou&s;e was crowded, the receipts 166<HI>l.</HI> 13<HI>s.</HI> 5<HI>d.</HI> and the piece &s;ucceeded equal to his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. Mr. Foote at this time was of infinite &s;ervice. He &s;eldom played to le&s;s than an hundred pounds, and &s;ometimes to an hun|dred and thirty.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="177">Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's engagement with Le Nemora, Semanzati, and Signiora Ro&s;&s;oli, was not &s;o fortunate. Though excellent in their perfor|mances on the rope, the public were di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;uch exhibitions. They had not attraction the fir&s;t night, which amounted to only 39<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h the public were ever of the &s;ame mind: and, whil&s;t their bounty &s;hould enable managers to provide the noble&s;t, and mo&s;t ra|tional entertainment, the human mind can re|ceive, a &s;election of the various beauties of the drama, to bani&s;h &s;uch &s;pecies of entertainment, to their proper &s;phere of action.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity, almo&s;t always, forces managers to re&s;ources their judgment condemns, and there are few in&s;tances where they have been adopted, till every other exertion has failed. In &s;uch ca&s;es, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think them more to be pitied, than condemned.</P>
<P>The remainder of the &s;ea&s;on glided away, without any very remarkable occurrence.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Walker, after pa&s;&s;ing a few years at Covent-garden, returned to this kingdom,
<PB N="164" REF="178">
and proved an addition to the Iri&s;h &s;tage. Mr. Walker had much merit in tyrants, as Barba|ro&s;&s;a, Timurkan, Bajazet, and Mrs. Walker great vivacity, life and &s;pirit, in the Chamber|maids.</P>
<P>A Mi&s;s Gro&s;&s;e made her fir&s;t appearance in Lady Townly, for which &s;he had hardly a re|qui&s;ite. Her &s;econd attempt, however, rectified this mi&s;take, and in Ro&s;etta, &s;he gave hopes of adding to the entertainment of the public, to whom &s;he was afterwards known by the name of Mrs. Barre. She had a &s;trong, clear, com|manding voice, and afterwards proved a u&s;eful member of the dramatic &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the general &s;ucce&s;s of mu&s;i|cal pieces of merit, the very excellent, and at pre&s;ent popular, comic opera of the Padlock, was at this time an exception. It was brought out in January, l769, with every advantage, after Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's Hamlet, to 80<HI>l.</HI> when, &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion did it make, that the &s;econd night there was only 51<HI>l.</HI> the third, 41<HI>l.</HI> afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which, it was obliged to be tacked to Mr Mo&s;&s;op's &s;trong tragedies.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING Mr. Mo&s;&s;op opened ear|ly, the 11th of October, 1769, with the Polly of Catley, who was announced only for a few nights, yet the beginning of his &s;ea&s;on was not very au&s;picious. This great favourite had at that time lo&s;t part of her attraction, and an in|di&s;po&s;ition confining her after &s;he had played a few nights, the manager was him&s;elf obliged to come forward, in Hamlet, which brought a tolerable hou&s;e, 95<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="182">With every requi&s;ite of face, figure, voice and abilities, Mi&s;s A&s;hmore, then ju&s;t ri&s;ing in her profe&s;&s;ion, began to attract general notice, and with irre&s;i&s;tible force, put in her mode&s;t claim to public favour, a claim which was univer&s;ally allowed, and which, for many years, &s;he mo&s;t de&s;ervedly enjoyed, without interruption.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the parts &s;he was then mo&s;t noticed in, were Polly and Lucy, in the Beggar's Opera, Ro&s;etta, Arethu&s;a, in the Contrivances, Leo|nora in the Padlock, Patty in the Maid of the Mill, Phillida, Sally, Ophelia, Leonora, Re|venge; Irene, Barbaro&s;&s;a; Cordelia, Lear; Emeline in King Arthur, Flora in the Wonder; Portia, Hypolita, Kind Impo&s;tor, Cherry, &amp;c. So promi&s;ing an actre&s;s had not been &s;een in Ireland a long time, and we &s;hall find that &s;he fully an&s;wered the high opinion conceived of her great talents.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the new performers of the &s;ea&s;on, were Mi&s;s Gla&s;&s;ington, who appeared in Vio|lante; Mr. and Mrs. Graham, in Scrub and Mrs. Sullen; Mi&s;s Man&s;ell, for the fir&s;t time on any &s;tage, in Juliet. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the ma|nager pre&s;ented the town with Rope Dancers,
<PB N="169" REF="183">
equilibri&s;ts on the wire, &amp;c. in every form and variety.</P>
<P>In po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both theatres, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op indulged his fancy by playing by turns in each. Tragedies, which alone brought money, at Crow-&s;treet; comedies, with the rope and wire, at Smock-alley. Public ta&s;te was never more con&s;picuous than on this occa&s;ion. Tragedies were &s;eldom performed to le&s;s than to ninety or an hundred pounds, whil&s;t the performances on the wire and rope &s;eldom ammounted to 40<HI>l.</HI> often under 20<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Tamerlane was revived about this time, and brought &s;everal hou&s;es. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's Bajazet, mo&s;t certainly was among&s;t his be&s;t performances, and added much to his reputation. Tamerlane, Mr. Heaphy; Mone&s;es Mr. Clinch; Axalla, Mr. Banni&s;ter; Selima, Mi&s;s Gla&s;&s;ington, Arpa&s;ia, Mrs. Fitzhenry.</P>
<P>The theatrical world may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as an epitome of the world at large. Her em|pires have as great a variety of intere&s;ts, and are &s;ubject to as many vici&s;&s;itudes and revolutions. Firmly as Mr. Mo&s;&s;op thought him&s;elf &s;eated
<PB N="170" REF="184">
on the dramatic throne of this kingdom, yet did he find con&s;piracies formed again&s;t him, which, though at fir&s;t he di&s;regarded them, yet did the hand of time mature and ripen into a &s;ucce&s;s he thought impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Lulled into perfect &s;ecurity, by the certainty of having the two theatres of Crow-&s;treet and Smock-alley, he little imagined that a third could be opened. The event &s;hewed how much he was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The little theatre in Capel-&s;treet, had for many years been &s;hut up, and appropriated to other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es. It was certainly very &s;mall; but even this was of advantage; as it could be fitted up at le&s;s expence, could be much ea&s;ier filled, and con&s;equently, derive more credit from le&s;s &s;hew.</P>
<P>This revolution was concerted and compa&s;&s;ed, with much addre&s;s, and united the intere&s;ts of Mr. Daw&s;on, Mr. Mahon, and Mr. Wilkes. Daw&s;on was the manager of this new erected company, and by the experience he had had, was, in many re&s;pects, equal to the ta&s;k. He was active, indu&s;trious, and intelligent, well ac|quainted with the world, and prompt to im|prove
<PB N="171" REF="185">
every opportunity fortune threw in his way. The theatre was elegantly ornamented and beautified; the &s;cenes new painted, by Jolly. The wardrobe, as might be expected, light, but fa&s;hionable, and &s;hewy.</P>
<P>Every arrangement being adju&s;ted, in the be&s;t manner the times would permit, the new adventurers opened on Monday February 26th, 1770, with a new comedy, never performed in this kingdow, written by Hugh Kelly, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and then in reputation in London, called</P>
<P>FALSE DELICACY. Repre&s;ented in the following manner: Colonel Rivers, Mr. Mahon; From the Theatre-royal Covent-garden. Cecil, Mr. Herbert; Sir Harry Newburgh, Mr. Lewis; Sidney, Mr. Glenville; Lord Winworth, Mr. Wilkes; Being his fir&s;t appearance in this Kingdom. Mrs. Harley, Mrs. Ho&s;kins; From the Theatre-royal Drury-lane. Lady Betty Lambton, Mi&s;s Ambro&s;e; Mi&s;s Rivers, Mrs. O'Neill;
<PB N="172" REF="186">
Sally, Mrs. Price; And Mi&s;s Marchmont, by Mi&s;s A&s;hmore; With an occa&s;ional Prologue &s;poken by Mr. Lewis. To which will be added a Comic Opera, called THE PADLOCK. With alterations and additions by the author, as performed in London. Don Diego, Mr. Glenville; Leander, Mr. Wilkes; Mungo, Mr. Mahon; Ur&s;ula, Mrs. Ho&s;kins; And the part of Leonora, by Mi&s;s A&s;hmore.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that though there were &s;everal performers of the fir&s;t merit in the new erected company, yet they could not, in numbers, or indeed abilities, compare with the veterans of Crow-&s;treet, nor could they, from any apparent circum&s;tances, flatter them&s;elves with the hopes of that &s;ucce&s;s, which crowned their adventurous &s;chemes.</P>

<P>From the above &s;tatement, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op might in &s;ome mea&s;ure be ju&s;tified, for holding in &s;uch a contemptuous light, the new formed oppo&s;ition. But, what human prudence could not fore&s;ee, fortune &s;peedily accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity and intere&s;t, crowded Capel-&s;treet theatre, the fir&s;t night, and the performances were received with the mo&s;t unbounded applau&s;e. The new theatre, dre&s;&s;es, novelty of the play, and &s;everal of the performers, the brilliancy of every object and the &s;pirit which animated the whole, operated with magical force, and e&s;tab|li&s;hed
<PB N="175" REF="189">
a reputation, which afterwards proved of infinite &s;ervice.</P>
<P>What contributed e&s;&s;entially to the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;cheme, was the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which Mr. Lewis and Mi&s;s A&s;hmore rendered.</P>
<P>The former was, even at that early period, e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing young actors on the &s;tage, and had &s;upported a variety of characters, with the highe&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>The latter I have already mentioned. She was then an object of univer&s;al admiration, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the favour of the town in an eminent degree. The new manager had the addre&s;s to attach her to his party, and &s;he proved of in|finite &s;ervice to the cau&s;e. A fortunate circum|&s;tance added Mr. Wilkes, to the number of favourites.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the progre&s;s of this unfore&s;een dan|ger, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op u&s;ed every effort, in his power, to counteract it's effects.</P>
<P>He brought forward tho&s;e tragedies in which he &s;tood unrivalled, particularly his Coriolanus,
<PB N="176" REF="190">
with every pomp, and magnificence. He ex|hibited Catley in her Euphro&s;ine, which u&s;ed to have &s;uch attraction. He revived Woodward's popular pantomimes of Fortunatus, and the Sorcerer, and introduced in them the perfor|mances of Saunders on the wire, and Lenomo|ra, on the rope; but all with very little effect. His expences were heavy, his receipts were bad, and his competitors gained ground, though ra|ther &s;lowly.</P>
<P>While matters were in this &s;ituation, a circum|&s;tance occurred, which decided the conte&s;t in favour of the new theatre.</P>
<P>Bicker&s;taff's opera of Lionel and Clari&s;&s;a, was then performing with uncommon reputation, at Covent-garden. Relying on his own pieces, and the plan he had laid down, the evil genius of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, prevented him from &s;eizing the only opportunity, which might lead towards retrieving his embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>With Catley's fame and abilities, had he fir&s;t pre&s;ented this celebrated piece to the public, he mo&s;t probably would have attracted to his theatre
<PB N="177" REF="191">
that tide of &s;ucce&s;s, which his opponents &s;o amply experienced.</P>
<P>Not &s;o Mr. Daw&s;on's di&s;cerning eye beheld the advantages in pro&s;pect. He in&s;tantly &s;et about getting it up, with every care and expedition. The 2d of April, 1770, it was announced, for the fir&s;t time in this kingdom, and on it's ap|pearance, received that &s;tamp of public approba|tion it has ever &s;ince &s;o deeply retained.</P>
<P>Though Lionel and Clari&s;&s;a is certainly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of great merit, being an excellent comedy, independant of the mu&s;ic, which is in general, a capital &s;election, and though it &s;tands de&s;erv|edly high in the e&s;timation of the &s;i&s;ter kingdom; yet was it re&s;erved for the Iri&s;h audience, to re|ceive it with that enthu&s;ia&s;m and partiality, which has ever peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed its repre|&s;entation in this kingdom.</P>
<P>The Clari&s;&s;a of Mi&s;s A&s;hmore, according to every opinion, was as affecting, natural, and intere&s;ting a piece of acting, as had ever been &s;een: and the Je&s;&s;amy of Mr. Wilkes, was con|&s;idered, as the &s;tandard of excellence. Every
<PB N="178" REF="192">
other character of the opera, &s;eemed to be al&s;o well &s;upported.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion it made was extraordinary, and the effects vi&s;ible. Whil&s;t Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, with the &s;trength of his company, was exhibiting to or|ders or empty benches, an early overflow mark|ed every night this popular opera was an|nounced.</P>
<P>Some idea may be formed of it's power, and uncommon attraction, from the number of times it was acted. Late as it was brought out, it run twenty &s;ix nights, and clo&s;ed a &s;ea&s;on, that will always be di&s;tingui&s;hed in the theatrical annal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op when too late, &s;aw his error, and endeavoured in vain to repair it. In about three weeks after it's appearance at Capel-&s;treet, it was brought out at Crow-&s;treet, with this ridiculous di&s;tinction: Jenny the Chambermaid, Mi&s;s Catley; the other characters by Mr. Wil|der, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Heaphy, Mr. Banni&s;ter, Mr. Remington, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Hawtry, Mrs. Barry.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="193">It langui&s;hed a few nights, and was then cut down into a farce, which compleatly fini&s;hed it in the opinion of every one.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the contending parties, at the clo&s;e of the campaign, may ea&s;ily be conceived. With health impaired, and circum&s;tances much deranged, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's pro&s;pects were of the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant nature. Though the idol of the town, as an actor, and not cen&s;ured as a mana|ger; (a thing extremely difficult to avoid) he &s;aw him&s;elf de&s;erted by that public, to who&s;e &s;ervice he had devoted tho&s;e abilities &s;o much admired. A &s;triking le&s;&s;on to every manager, how little he can depend on that empty bubble popularity!</P>
<P>Elate with their &s;ucce&s;s, the oppo&s;ite party, indeed, exulted in the confidence of it's con|tinuance. Time will tell, how far their expec|tations were an&s;wered.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE per&s;evering indu&s;try of Mr. Daw&s;on, &s;eemed re&s;olved to take every advantage of events &s;o favourable. He obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crow-&s;treet theatre, abandoned by Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, and transferred from it, the title of his maje&s;ties &s;ervants, to that of Capel-&s;treet.</P>
<P>During the &s;ummer, he al&s;o made &s;everal capital engagements. In particular, Mr. Mack|lin, Mi&s;s Young, and Mr. Clinch.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="195">However, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e great advan|tages, it was rather late before either company took the field.</P>
<P>Capel-&s;treet was the fir&s;t, which opened with it's new title, November 9th, 1770, with the Beggar's Opera, and the Anatomi&s;t. The former pre&s;ented no novelty: in the latter, Mr. Dodd made his fir&s;t appearance, in Mon&s;ieur Le Medecin.</P>
<P>This gentleman, who has &s;ince di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the literary world, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed theatrical abilities, which, if he had continued on the &s;tage, and cultivated, would have gained him &s;ome eminence. His Frenchmen were excel|lent, and he di&s;played a good deal of merit, in &s;everal other characters.</P>
<P>In about a fortnight after, Mi&s;s Young, from Drury-lane theatre, who was then advancing fa&s;t to that eminence which &s;he &s;peedily attain|ed, and which &s;he has &s;ince con&s;tantly pre&s;erved, made her entre in this kingdom, in Jane Shore. Ha&s;tings, Mr. Lewis; Dumont, Mr. Clinch; Glo&s;ter, Mr. Daw&s;on; and Alicia, Mrs. Burden.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="196">Her reception was &s;uch as her merit amply ju&s;tified: flattering, as her &s;anguine hopes could form; and during the &s;ea&s;on, &s;he &s;upported a capital line, in tragedy and comedy, with in|crea&s;ing reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. Macklin cho&s;e his favourite character of Shylock, to receive the gratulations of his friends, on his revi&s;iting them, which on his appearance they loudly marked.</P>
<P>In the Merchant of Venice, we find Mr. O'Keefe's name, for the part of Gratiano, and &s;peedily after, in Filch, Fribble, Je&s;&s;amy, in Lionel, in the room of Wilkes, who had left the company, Squire Richard, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again&s;t &s;uch performers, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op had but little to oppo&s;e. Smock-alley was once more fitted up, new painted and decorated, as well as circum&s;tances would allow, and as the city theatre, under the patronage of the Lord Mayor, opened on the 26th of November, with the tragedy of George Barnwell. The hero of the piece by Mr. L'E&s;trange, from the theatre Drury-lane, of whom little could be &s;aid, and a Mrs. Day, in the Virgin Unma&s;ked.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="197">From this &s;pecimen, much was not to be ex|pected. However, as his great re&s;ource, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own was informed, that Mr. Ryder, who had been ab&s;ent from the capital for the la&s;t five years, was again engaged, and would &s;peedily make his appearance.</P>
<P>The interval of ab&s;ence had been &s;pent in the country of Ireland, where he had conducted a com|pany, which during that time he managed, with much credit and emolument to him&s;elf and his performers. The towns he chiefly vi&s;ited were, Kilkenny, Waterford, Sligo, Galway, Derry, Belfa&s;t, &amp;c. where the general bu&s;ine&s;s was ex|cellent, and the benefits lucrative.</P>
<P>Mr. Ryder on his return, opened in Sir John Re&s;tle&s;s, and was received by the audience with that warmth of friendly applau&s;e, which ever marked his appearance.</P>
<P>His pre&s;ence was of infinite &s;ervice to Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's drooping affairs: for though he was not able entirely to &s;tem the tide of popular fa|vour, that continued to follow Capel-&s;treet theatre, yet he for a time upheld a cau&s;e, which,
<PB N="184" REF="198">
without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; mu&s;t have &s;unk under the pre&s;&s;ure of accumulated misfortunes.</P>
<P>Ever di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the ver&s;atility, as well as excellence of his genius, Mr. Ryder even then, might be deemed a theatrical Atlas, who at that time, and for many years after, princi|pally &s;upported the heavy burthen of the Iri&s;h drama. This may ea&s;ily be perceived by a re|view of the various characters he &s;u&s;tained, during a period of eleven or twelve years, when it might be truly &s;aid, he was almo&s;t every night before the public.</P>
<P>The favourite popular opera of Lionel, was often repeated at both hou&s;es, the early part of the &s;ea&s;on, but Capel-&s;treet &s;till maintained the advantage, although Mr. Ryder was the Lionel at Smock-alley.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Young and Mr. Macklin, were of in|finite &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rvice to the cau&s;e they e&s;pou&s;ed. The latter brought out his Love a la Mode, and True born Scotchman, with every advantage which capital acting, aided by his in&s;tructions, could give. They were often repeated to good ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="199">The Romp, in which Mi&s;s A&s;hmore obtained &s;uch reputation, was fir&s;t acted at this period, and has continued to be a leading object in dra|matic exhibitions ever &s;ince. The comedy of 'Tis Well it is no Wor&s;e, was al&s;o performed at this time.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ability which had &s;o eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hed the Capel-&s;treet manager la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, was of infinite &s;ervice during the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mr. Cumberland had, in the early part of the winter, brought out his comedy of the We&s;t Indian, with a &s;ucce&s;s &s;uperior almo&s;t to any ever known. Its great and extraordinary fame, rendered it an object of the fir&s;t magnitude to both theatres.</P>
<P>Capel-&s;treet, however, had the good fortune to produce it fir&s;t to the public, and, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, with much greater advantage than it could be given by Mr. Mo&s;&s;op.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, February 19th, 1771, it was announced, for the fir&s;t time in this kingdom. Belcour, Mr. Lewis; En&s;ign Dudley, Mr. Clinch; Stockwell, Mr. Holocombe; Captain Dudley,

<P>The &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, which attended this excel|lent comedy in London, pur&s;ued it here. The public was charmed with a piece which, with uncommon merit, pre&s;ented &s;o amiable a por|trait of an Iri&s;h gentleman, and in Major O'Fla|herty, united the brave veteran &s;oldier, with the man of feeling, who&s;e heart was replete with the noble&s;t impul&s;es of humanity.</P>
<P>And whil&s;t they admired the piece, they could not help ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lauding the actors, who&s;e merits were never more con&s;picuous than in this co|medy. The Belcour of Mr. Lewis has &s;o often been the &s;ubject of panegyric, that to mention it here would be u&s;ele&s;s: Mr. Daw&s;on's Major, Mi&s;s A&s;hmore's Loui&s;a, and Mi&s;s Young's Char|lotte, were truly characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>Such was its reputation, that they had four or five crouded hou&s;es to it, before it could be produced at Smock-alley, and then it did very little. It was not the fa&s;hion, and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op
<PB N="187" REF="201">
continued playing it to hou&s;es compo&s;ed of or|ders, whil&s;t at Capel-&s;treet, there was an over|flow every night.</P>
<P>It certainly could not be nece&s;&s;ity which in|duced Mr. Mo&s;&s;op to attempt the &s;prightly, ele|gant, vivacious Belcour, &s;o totally oppo&s;ite to his own manner. But whatever was the motive, it helped to give additional force to the fini&s;hed We&s;t Indian of the other hou&s;e: and though Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's merits as a tragedian, were the univer&s;al theme of prai&s;e and admiration, yet his warme&s;t admirers could not but confe&s;s his great deficiency, and total want of manner, for this hero of comedy.</P>
<P>At the time this admirable comedy was per|forming, with the highe&s;t reputation in Dublin, as well as in London, the author happened to be on a vi&s;it at a Mr. Cottingham's, a gentleman of great re&s;pectability and fortune, at the town of Cavan, in the north of Ireland.</P>
<P>At this very juncture, a company of players happened to be performing there. The news of his arrival being &s;pread abroad, it in&s;pired them with the idea of &s;eizing the golden oppor|tunity,
<PB N="188" REF="202">
and whil&s;t he remained in the country, of performing his favourite comedy, which, from his being &s;o well known and on the &s;pot, they judged would receive every &s;upport and encou|ragement from his friends.</P>
<P>Full of this project, they &s;et about &s;tudying the parts, with the greate&s;t alacrity, and the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy, and the poor author one even|ing had the un&s;peakable mortification, without the lea&s;t notice, to find the comedy of the We&s;t Indian, <HI>"written by R. Cumberland, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>"</HI> and a long puff about it's &s;ucce&s;s in London, and the two hou&s;es in Dublin, announced for repre&s;enta|tion the next night.</P>
<P>This, though not very plea&s;ing he was not only obliged to &s;ubmit to, but was al&s;o forced to attend this very extraordinary exhibition.</P>
<P>About an hour before the time of beginning, a &s;ervant came to keep places for Mr. Cotting|ham, Mr. Cumberland, and a large party. This news &s;truck the company into the greate&s;t pa|nick. They had not an idea of his coming to &s;ee them, and, almo&s;t petrified with fear, that
<PB N="189" REF="203">
&s;ingle circum&s;tance drove the little they did know, entirely out of their heads.</P>
<P>A little before the beginning, Mr. Cumber|land and his party came into the theatre. The appearance of it did not prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him much in its favour. It was a temporary building, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, erected in the town hall. The &s;tage, rai&s;ed two or three feet: the audi|ence part, a range of &s;eats, divided by a thin partition, into pit and gallery.</P>
<P>In the front of the pit, was Mr. Cumberland &s;eated; the hou&s;e crowded, every expectation rai&s;ed on high, and all eyes turned on the author, when the curtain drew up, and di&s;covered the manager &s;eated, for Stockwell, at a table, with a book of the play before him, to refre&s;h his memory in ca&s;e of accident, and Stukely wait|ing; when, ca&s;ting his eyes on the author, it effectually fini&s;hed him.</P>
<P>Had not Mr. Cumberland been there, he might, in the theatrical phra&s;e, have bu&s;tled through; that is, he might have known the pur|port of the part, and where the original language failed him, &s;ub&s;tituted his own, &s;o that an au|dience,
<PB N="190" REF="204">
unacquainted with the piece, could not ea&s;ily perceive where he was at a lo&s;s; but here, con&s;cious of his being deprived of that re|&s;ource, the little he did know his fear hindered him from recollecting; and, in&s;tead of &s;everal pages of de&s;cription, developing the plot of his marriage, and the birth of the hero of the piece, after a long pau&s;e, he &s;aid, <HI>"Belcour is arrived."</HI></P>
<P>Confounded at this unexpected &s;peech, Stuke|ly, after &s;ome he&s;itation, replied, <Q>I believe he is Sir.</Q> Another long &s;tand en&s;ued, when on popped Mr. Barret, (well known in the Iri&s;h theatric world,) for Belcour!</P>
<P>Now this gentleman, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much merit in a peculiar line, and an admir|able figure for the Jew in the School for Scan|dal, was by no means calculated, in any re&s;pect, to convey the idea of a young, volatile, elegant, fiery, We&s;t Indian.</P>
<P>At the appearance of Mr. Barret, for this pe|culiar favourite of the author, the whole hou&s;e, in &s;pite of their re&s;pect for the writer, bur&s;t into an involuntary and loud laugh, which continued
<PB N="191" REF="205">
for &s;ome minutes, and &s;erved to increa&s;e the con|fu&s;ion of the actors.</P>
<P>But Mr. Barre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was very perfect, and &s;oon recovering him&s;elf, the &s;cene went on with to|lerable compo&s;ure, till the appearance of Major O'Flaherty, who, as the company was rather thin, was obliged to be doubled by the manager with Stockwell.</P>
<P>This new and unexpected &s;troke, produced another roar of applau&s;e, and entirely completed the confu&s;ion and vexation of the poor author, who, unable to bear this cruel mangling of &s;o excellent a comedy, would have withdrawn, but was prevented by his numerous friends, many of whom having &s;een it in London and Dublin, en|joyed the pre&s;ent repre&s;entation with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure. The more laughable and ludicrous the performance was, the more acceptable it was to them, and the more they enjoyed it.</P>
<P>Not &s;o with Mr. Cumberland; his feelings were too much alive to be able to bear it with pati|ence, and heartily glad was he when the con|clu&s;ion of the play gave him leave to depart.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE the We&s;t Indian had run it's career in Dublin, Mr. Daw&s;on exhibited another &s;troke of general&s;hip, which de&s;erved to be remem|bered. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op for above two years pa&s;t, had been preparing the town for the reception of his dramatic romance of Cymon, which at
<PB N="193" REF="207">
that time was very popular in London. The &s;cenes were painted, the dre&s;&s;es made, and the mo&s;t &s;plendid decorations promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>As the time approached for bringing it for|ward, each new&s;paper was filled with para|graphs, and encomiums, on the excellence of the piece, the beauty of the mu&s;ic, and the ca|pital manner in which it was to be exhibited. At length, the day was appointed for the perfor|mance of this long expected and much fam|ed romance, which was to be on Friday March 8th.</P>
<P>On the Saturday night preceding this Friday, Mr. Daw&s;on, after the play was over at Capel-&s;treet theatre, &s;tept forward and gave out for the Monday evening following, the celebrated dra|matic romance of Cymon, with all the original mu&s;ic, and entire new &s;cenery, machinery, dre&s;|&s;es, and decorations, and a grand proce&s;&s;ion of the knights of the different orders of chivalry.</P>
<P>The audience were a&s;toni&s;hed, and his own performers could &s;carce credit their &s;en&s;es. But he &s;oon convinced them he was in earne&s;t, for &s;o complete, &s;ecret, and ma&s;terly were his
<PB N="194" REF="208">
movements, that not a &s;ingle article was want|ing in the various requi&s;ites.</P>
<P>Without di&s;clo&s;ing his de&s;ign, he had got a mo&s;t capital &s;et of &s;cenes painted, and had pro|vided the different dre&s;&s;es, which were made by Lupino, tailor to the Opera Hou&s;e, London. The mu&s;ic he had got practiced, and the princi|pal parts &s;tudied, under the pretence that, after their opponents had played it a few nights as a fir&s;t piece, he then would bring it out as a farce. In &s;hort, a de&s;ign &s;o well concerted, and which required &s;o much forethought and addre&s;s, would have done honour to the fir&s;t general of the age.</P>
<P>On the Monday evening following, March 4th, Cymon was exhibited at Capel-&s;treet theatre, with a correctne&s;s and brilliancy which were highly creditable. The &s;cenery was beau|tiful, and well adapted; &s;he dre&s;&s;es picture&s;que and according to the original models, and the proce&s;&s;ion remarkably &s;plendid and nouvelle. All the performers, without exception, walked in different characters, and upwards of forty &s;upernumeries filled up the train, in proper habits.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="209">The repre&s;entation of this charming romance, as might be expected, afforded infinite &s;atisfac|tion, and when given out again, was &s;anctioned by reiterated plaudits.</P>
<P>This was a thunder&s;troke to the other party, who beheld the hope of their long expected harve&s;t &s;o &s;uddenly bla&s;ted and de&s;troyed. It was performed four nights before they were able to bring it out at Smock-alley, and even then, though it was got up with great care and attention, yet as fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are not ea&s;ily era&s;ed, the public were prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of Capel-&s;treet, and though it was often played during the &s;ea&s;on, yet it never an&s;wered the expence, and was afterwards reduced to a farce.</P>
<P>In the&s;e conte&s;ted pieces I judge that perhaps the reader may be intere&s;ted more than in the common routine of bu&s;ine&s;s. I therefore ge|nerally &s;ubjoin the &s;upport each received, at their re&s;pective theatres.</P>
<P>In compliance with this rule, the following is the drama of Cymon, as then repre&s;ented.</P>

<P>The Romp, which has been already mentioned, was al&s;o about this time exhibited in Capel-&s;treet, in which Mi&s;s A&s;hmore acquired great and de|&s;erved reputation. The&s;e pieces, with Mr. Macklin's Love a la Mode, and Trueborn Scotchman, brought them through the remain|der of the &s;ea&s;on. The We&s;t Indian run up|wards of eighteen nights, Cymon nine, the Romp &s;ix or &s;even, the Trueborn Scotchman &s;even, and the &s;ucce&s;s which attended them
<PB N="197" REF="211">
&s;eemed to give the fini&s;hing &s;troke to Mr. Mo&s;|&s;op's management.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in his hopes, harra&s;&s;ed by in|numerable vexations, and oppre&s;&s;ed with debts he had not the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of being able to di&s;charge, his &s;pirits &s;unk under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;uch accumulated misfortunes, and a &s;evere ill|ne&s;s prevented his appearing on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Thus unfortunately circum&s;tanced, he was obliged to &s;olicit the genero&s;ity of the public he had &s;o many times delighted: and, in this di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, announced a benefit for him&s;elf, in which he was unable to perform, and in his adverti&s;ement "humbly hoped his indi&s;po&s;i|tion would not prevent the attendance of his friends."</P>
<P>The benefit was fixed for the 17th of April, 1771, when the comedy of Rule a Wife, was acted. The Copper Captain, Mr. Ryder; Leon, Mr. Heaphy; Margaritta, Mi&s;s Man&s;ell, and E&s;tifania, Mrs. Brown, late Mi&s;s Slack; with Cymon now reduced to an afterpiece.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="212">Though the hou&s;e was very much crowded, yet the receipts afforded but a temporary relief. His affairs were &s;o de&s;perate that it was next to an impo&s;&s;ibility for any immediate efforts to retrieve them.</P>
<P>Much to the honour of the new managers, they would not attempt to oppre&s;s a fallen ene|my, and therefore did not oppo&s;e the benefit, by playing on that night. The greatne&s;s of their &s;ucce&s;s enlarged their hopes, and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op being obliged to relinqui&s;h Crow-&s;treet theatre, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and removed thither in the month of March, whither the favour of the town attended them with unabating warmth. A few benefits were taken at Smock-alley by the mo&s;t capital performers, and they clo&s;ed early in May.</P>
<P>Pro&s;perity did not make the new managers of Crow-&s;treet &s;lacken their endeavours. On the contrary, the three kingdoms were explored for novelty. They brought over that very excellent comedian and facetious companion Mr. I&s;aac Sparks, who after a five years ab&s;ence made his appearance in John Moody.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="213">In May, Mr. and Mrs. Jack&s;on, from the theatre-royal Edinburgh, arrived. The public were already well acquainted with the merit of Mrs. Jack&s;on, late Mi&s;s Browne, daughter of Mr. Sowdon. She had been ab&s;ent near five years, and appeared again, for the fir&s;t time, in Polly, a character which her figure and voice pecu|liarly &s;uited. Mr. Jack&s;on's debut was in Oroo|noko.</P>
<P>They were favourites with the town, and played a variety of parts with much reputa|tion.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ent to the public was Mr. Barry, who now dive&s;ted of his royal honours, though not of his powers to charm, once more moved in a private &s;tation.</P>
<P>He was accompanied by Mrs. Dancer, now Mrs. Barry, who on the 13th of June, played Ro&s;alind, a part &s;he was peculiarly happy in; Orlando by Mr. Lewis, Jaques by Mr. Sowdon who was of his party in this expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="214">A few nights after, Mr. Barry appeared in Jaffier, when his return was welcomed with the mo&s;t unfeigned applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The remainder of the &s;ea&s;on was chiefly de|voted to the tragic mu&s;e; Mr. and Mrs. Barry repeated mo&s;t of their favourite characters, as Othello and De&s;demona, Lear and Cordelia, Lord and Lady Townly, Rhadami&s;tus and Zenobia, Alexander and Statira, Lord and Lady Sali&s;bury, Varanes and Athenais, Marc Anthony and Cleopatra, Romeo and Juliet, which clo&s;ed the &s;ea&s;on, Augu&s;t the third.</P>
<P>Early in June Mi&s;s Young returned to Eng|land, highly plea&s;ed with her trip, in which &s;he acquired a great portion of the two great e&s;&s;en|tials of theatric life, fame and profit. So &s;trong and favourable an impre&s;&s;ion did &s;he leave on the Iri&s;h audience, that time has never &s;ince obli|terated it, and every vi&s;it which &s;he afterwards made to this kingdom, &s;erved to &s;trengthen a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion founded on merit, and aided by private character.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="215">A few nights previous to the conclu&s;ion, Mr. I&s;aac Sparks introduced his &s;on, Mr. Richard Sparks, to the public in the part of Lord Townly. His youth and figure plea&s;ed much, and a laudable partiality for the father made the town entertain hopes he would prove a valuable ac|qui&s;ition to the drama.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the theatre clo&s;ed, a &s;mall party took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ranelagh gardens, where they exhibited Engli&s;h Burletta's, two or three times a week for the remainder of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This party con&s;i&s;ted principally of Mi&s;s A&s;h|more, Mi&s;s Hawtry, Mr. Ryder, Mr. Glenville, and Mr. Atkins. The Ephe&s;ian Matron was one of their capital exhibitions.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="217">The heavy hand of dire misfortune &s;till pur&s;ued, with unrelenting fury, the unhappy Mr. Mo&s;&s;op. Recovered &s;omewhat in his health, he embarked for England, and in London, endeavoured to procure reinforcements for the en&s;uing winter.</P>
<P>Hither his unrelenting creditors pur&s;ued him, and a Mr. Graham, one of his own performers, laid on the fir&s;t arre&s;t for non-payment of &s;alary due to him. This arre&s;t was &s;peedily followed by numbers of others, and he was confined in the King's Bench, without the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of relief.</P>
<P>On every feeling mind his misfortunes made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. The public &s;eemed much intere&s;ted in his fate, and lamented that a man of &s;uch genius &s;hould be &s;o involved, from a train of untoward circum&s;tances, in which his prudence could not fairly be im|peached.</P>
<P>Another benefit for him in Smock-alley was fixed on by his friends, previous to the com|mencement of the &s;ea&s;on, when an occa&s;ional prologue was &s;poken by Mr Ryder, who did every thing on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> friend&s;hip could

&s;ugge&s;t, or the nature of his &s;ituation would ad|mit of.</P>
<P>The following adverti&s;ement appeared, pre|paratory to the benefit.</P>
<P>"The friends of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op make no doubt, that the lovers of the drama in particular, and the nobility and gentry of this kingdom in ge|neral, ever eminent for their encouragement of merit, will exert them&s;elves on the above oc|ca&s;ion, as Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's ca&s;e is peculiarly &s;evere, having at great trouble and va&s;t expence, during the &s;ummer, made very con&s;iderable theatrical engagements in England for the entertainment of this city, when, on the very eve of his return to this kingdom, to reap the harve&s;t of his la|bours, he met with the hard hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, and that chiefly from people of his own pro|fe&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>The play was the Orphan, and never was there a more crowded hou&s;e. The amount how|ever, was &s;till inadequate to the end propo&s;ed, and, as there was a great overflow, the play was repeated two nights after, with this addition to the bills, "'tis humbly hoped the nobility and
<PB N="205" REF="219">
gentry will &s;till exert them&s;elves, and bring to his native country, one of the be&s;t theatrical per|formers now living."</P>
<P>But ineffectual were the&s;e well-meant efforts of his friends. His native country never beheld him more! So great and various were his debts, that after a &s;evere confinement, he was at la&s;t obliged to take the benefit of an act of bank|ruptcy, before he could regain his liberty.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, Smock-alley theatre &s;till kept open, though with the utmo&s;t difficulty. Mr. Ryder had now an Herculean weight upon his &s;houlders. A &s;inking theatre almo&s;t up-held, it might be &s;aid, by the &s;ingle &s;trength of his abilities.</P>
<P>It is true Mr. and Mrs. Jack&s;on in this exi|gence were of the highe&s;t &s;ervice to the cau&s;e, e&s;pecially in tragedy. They performed Romeo and Juliet, Othello and De&s;demona, Tancred and Sigi&s;munda, and a variety of other characters.</P>

<P>The principal object of his journey was to clo&s;e an engagement with Mr. Macklin, with whom he had always lived on terms of &s;trict friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>The theatre opened on the 11th of November, 1771, with the Provoked Hu&s;band, and Devil to Pay. Lord Townly, Mr. Sparks jun.!

<P><PB N="207" REF="221">Mr. Sheridan was al&s;o engaged for &s;ix nights, and played his Cato, Hamlet, Richard, Lear, &amp;c.

<P>It would be inju&s;tice, were I not in this place to notice the ri&s;ing fame, popularity, and &s;u|perior abilities of Mr. Lewis, who though &s;o very young, gave every promi&s;e of attaining that dramatic excellence he has &s;ince &s;o uniformly di&s;played. At this time he &s;upported a very exten&s;ive and varied line of bu&s;ine&s;s in tragedy and comedy with great ability.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE heavy pre&s;&s;ure of adver&s;ity, &s;till with increa&s;ing rigour, pur&s;ued the ill-fated Mr. Mo&s;&s;op.</P>
<P>On the 28th of January, 1772, we find the following intere&s;ting intelligence re&s;pecting him in a London paper.</P>
<Q><PB N="212" REF="226">On Saturday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">night, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op appeared before the commi&s;&s;ioners of bankrupts at Guild-hall, being the third meeting, when he pa&s;&s;ed his examination and delivered up his effects, which were about 130<HI>l.</HI> in ca&s;h, a 40<HI>l.</HI> and a 10<HI>l.</HI> bill, his gold watch, &amp;c. when the creditors humanely gave him back the bills, Gold watch, &amp;c. Mr. Garrick attended and proved a debt of about 200<HI>l.</HI> We are in|formed that Mr. Mo&s;&s;op will &s;oon make his appearance at Drury-lane theatre, in the cha|racter of Pierre.</Q>
<P>The latter part of the paragraph never took place. Various and in&s;urmountable difficulties prevented his ever again di&s;playing to the public, tho&s;e abilities that merited a better fate.</P>
<P>Mean time his numerous friends in this king|dom, were far from de&s;erting his cau&s;e. Ap|plication was once more made to the public for another benefit. Mrs. Fitzhenry kindly offered her &s;ervices on the occa&s;ion, and played Zaphira in Barbaro&s;&s;a, March the 23d.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="227">The emoluments ari&s;ing from this benefit, though con&s;iderable, proved a temporary relief, but were by no means adequate to the humane end propo&s;ed, and he &s;till was condemn|ed to &s;truggle with the rude gripe of adver|&s;ity.</P>
<P>The public now were, with much rea&s;on, heartily tired of the uncea&s;ing contentions ex|cited by the different parties, which produced no one good effect, and of who&s;e encrea&s;ing evils they &s;aw no end: many therefore of the mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and unprejudiced united in the idea of applying to parliament for e&s;tabli&s;hing one theatre only. A committee was formed, and in&s;tructions given for preparing a petition, and an adverti&s;ement was publi&s;hed, inviting all &s;uch as were de&s;irous of co-operating in &s;o u&s;e|ful and &s;alutary a &s;cheme to meet at Bardin's hotel, College-green.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan al&s;o in a pamphlet publi&s;hed at that time, which contained the purport of a &s;peech delivered to a number of auditors at the Mu&s;ic-hall in Fi&s;hamble-&s;treet, in a mo&s;t judici|ous and ma&s;terly manner, evinced the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting &s;uch a mea&s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of
<PB N="214" REF="228">
re&s;toring the &s;tage to a proper degree of credit and re&s;pectability. The meeting, however, was attended with very little effect, a contrariety of opinions which could not be reconciled, pre|vented the embracing &s;o &s;alutary a &s;cheme.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation which Mr. Cum|berland's We&s;t Indian had obtained, rendered his next comedy of the Brothers, a de&s;irable object for both parties, and another &s;cene of rival&s;hip was again acted over by the contending powers. Each &s;trove to bring it out fir&s;t, but on this occa&s;ion, Smock-alley produced it one day before Crow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>As it did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the intrin&s;ic merit of the former, &s;o al&s;o was it's &s;ucce&s;s proportionably inferior: it was played ten or twelve nights at each, without any rea&s;on for either to boa&s;t of it's reception, or attraction. Every exertion &s;eems, at this time, to have been made by both ma|nagers with very little effect. New and revived pieces, pantomimes in every &s;hape and form, and all the various &s;ources of dramatic entertain|ment were explored and exhau&s;ted to little pur|po&s;e. Novelty had lo&s;t it's charms, variety it's power; even the Ru&s;&s;ian dogs in a panto|mime,
<PB N="215" REF="229">
and the Elephant introduced at Smock-alley in the coronation in Henry the 8th, on which "the champion made his public entry in armour of burni&s;hed gold," could not draw.</P>
<P>At this unfavourable period was Mr. Murphy's tragedy of the Grecian Daughter, then in the very zenith of its reputation, introduced on the Iri&s;h &s;tage. The uncommon &s;ucce&s;s which at|tended it's exhibition in London, had fully e&s;tab|li&s;hed it's character in the dramatic world, and excited an earne&s;t de&s;ire in the public to be|hold a piece, of which fame &s;poke &s;o highly.</P>
<P>According to cu&s;tom, it was announced at both theatres, long before there was any po&s;|&s;ibility of bringing it forward; it was adverti&s;ed even to the morning of the very day on which it was to have been performed at Crow-&s;treet for the benefit of Mr. Sparks, jun. when in the evening there was an apology made, of the &s;ud|den illne&s;s of Mrs. Sparks, late Mi&s;s A&s;hmore, who was to have played Euphra&s;ia. The play was con&s;equently deferred.</P>
<P>The next attempt was at Smock-alley, when after &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> performed, May
<PB N="216" REF="230">
14th, for the benefit of Mrs. Ryder, who was the original Grecian Daughter in this kingdom. In about a fortnight after, Mr. Daw&s;on produced it for his benefit when Mrs. Sparks gave an im|pre&s;&s;ion of this popular heroine, with great truth of colouring and genuine touches of na|ture.</P>
<P>Brought out under &s;uch di&s;advantages, and &s;o far advanced in the &s;ea&s;on, it could not be expected to do much. Hereafter with Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer, we &s;hall find it drawing large &s;ums to the theatrical trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Much about this time, Mr. Wilkin&s;on, al|ways attached to this kingdom, which upon every occa&s;ion he celebrates for it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ho&s;pitality, and fond of a theatric excur&s;ion, quitted for a &s;hort &s;pace, his regal domains of York and Hull, once more to vi&s;it Dublin. Inclination led him to &s;upport the intere&s;ts of Crow-&s;treet, induced perhaps by Mr. Daw&s;on, who &s;ome time before in a tour through England, had &s;pent a few days at York, and probably laid the founda|tion of the pre&s;ent engagement.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="231">Captain Iron&s;ides in the Brothers, and Major Sturgeon in the Mayor of Garrett, both good copies of the originals, were the characters in which he cho&s;e to renew his acquaintance with the Iri&s;h audience, who received him with that cordiality and warmth his merit de&s;erved.</P>
<P>The very unplea&s;ant &s;ituation of the &s;tage at this time, rendered Mr. Wilkin&s;on's &s;tay very &s;hort in Dublin. He remained about a month, during which he played Colonel Oldboy, The Uphol&s;terer, Lord Ogleby, Shift, Smirk, and Mrs. Cole in the Minor, Cadwallader in the Author, the Commi&s;&s;ary, his tragedy A-la-Mode, Colin Mc. Cleod in the Fa&s;hionable Lover, and a few other of his favourites.</P>
<P>The remaining occurrences of the &s;ea&s;on were but few. Mr. Macklin fini&s;hed his engagement with Sir Paul Plyant and Love a-la-Mode, and returned to London, taking with him his pupil, Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, a young lady whom he fir&s;t intro|duced on the &s;tage at Crow-&s;treet theatre, early the preceding winter in Lady Townly, with much expectation, and who afterwards ap|peared not only in all his pieces, but &s;everal other principal parts in comedy with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="232">This lady who &s;everal times &s;ince has vi&s;ited Ireland, is at pre&s;ent Mrs. Lewis of Covent-garden theatre, who&s;e many virtues, and amiable private character, have ju&s;tly endeared her to a numerous and re&s;pectable circle of valuable friends.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of the la&s;t campaign, a variety of circum&s;tances indicated another theatric revolution, which the &s;ummer rece&s;s forwarded, and brought to a conclu&s;ion. On the ruins of the pre&s;ent dramatic &s;tate of Smock-alley,
<PB N="220" REF="234">
a new empire aro&s;e that flouri&s;hed for &s;everal years, and in the beginning promi&s;ed a perma|nency which it never attained. Mr. Ryder had long been ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the animating &s;pirit that gave life and motion to the theatre he upheld; it needed therefore, but little prepara|tion to di&s;&s;olve the old government, now too feeble to act with vigour, and form a new com|munity, which by having &s;o favourite an actor for their manager, gave every rea&s;onable hope of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Spurred on by ambition, unappalled by the numerous train of evils which had been recently experienced, and which are in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the general attendants on dramatic dominion, and not in the lea&s;t intimidated by the perils by which his predece&s;&s;ors peri&s;hed, Mr. Ryder a&s;|&s;umed the reins of theatric power at Smock-alley, and made every nece&s;&s;ary arrangment his judgment and prudence could dictate.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the times held forth many alluring inducements to Mr. Ryder to un|dertake &s;o arduous and difficult a ta&s;k, as that of directing an Iri&s;h theatre. The reduced, di&s;tre&s;t &s;ituation of the &s;tage at Smock-alley, which
<PB N="221" REF="235">
could not be &s;upported under its pre&s;ent difficul|ties; his being in the prime of life, con&s;cious of being capable of &s;u&s;taining by the &s;trength of his own abilities, a varied and exten&s;ive line of bu&s;ine&s;s; a great favourite with the public, by whom he was urged to the pre&s;ent undertak|ing; a tolerable knowledge of the theatric world, which his late practice in that capacity in the country had improved and extended; the&s;e mo|tives were more than &s;ufficient to excite in him an ardent de&s;ire to commence manager. Hope pictured to his warm imagination, a long &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of vi&s;ionary bli&s;s, which he &s;eldom ta&s;ted, and enjoyments which fall to the lot of few managers.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer vacation afforded excellent time for preparation. The theatre underwent a tho|rough repair, and received every embelli&s;hment it could admit of: a tolerable wardrobe was pro|vided, a compact company &s;elected, light and not expen&s;ive; capable of going through a good deal of bu&s;ine&s;s, and which received a powerful acce&s;&s;ion in Mrs. Sparks, who then &s;tood very high in public opinion, and who was prevailed on to quit the adver&s;e party.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="236">Every thing being in readine&s;s, as far as cir|cum&s;tances would admit, Mr. Ryder took the lead long before his opponent could draw his forces together, and opened &s;o early as Monday September, 1772, with an occa&s;ional prologue, after which was performed the &s;ame comedy that Me&s;&s;rs.

on the mu&s;ical gla&s;&s;es, and &s;everal others whom Mr. Ryder had engaged to join his &s;tandard.</P>
<P>For upwards of &s;ix weeks, Mr. Ryder had the town entirely to him&s;elf, an opportunity which he improved to the utmo&s;t. During this time Mr. Daw&s;on was far from remaining an idle &s;pectator. He fore&s;aw the impending &s;torm, and though he was not able to avert its fall, yet he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavour to divert and break its force. Notwith&s;tanding every effort, &s;uch were the difficulties he had to encounter, that he found it impo&s;&s;ible to open Crow-&s;treet theatre before Monday, November 9th, when the We&s;t Indian and Midas were performed with not the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>However, what could be accompli&s;hed in &s;uch a &s;ituation, he did. An engagement with Mr. Macklin and Mi&s;s Lee&s;on was announced, and early in the &s;ea&s;on he brought forward Mr. and Mrs. King, from the theatre-royal York, where they had re&s;ided &s;everal years, much e&s;teemed, and great favourites. Fame had &s;poke highly of Mrs. King's theatric abilities. In the York circuit &s;he was e&s;teemed equal to
<PB N="226" REF="240">
any actre&s;s on the &s;tage, and from this extraor|dinary and general character, Mr. Daw&s;on con|ceived, that in his pre&s;ent exigence, he had made a very valuable acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Mrs. King certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many requi&s;ites for the &s;tage. Nature had be&s;towed on her a tall, commanding, elegant figure, with a face capable of exhibiting every di&s;crimination of the various pa&s;&s;ions of the drama; to the&s;e &s;he added all the poli&s;hed grace of action which a mind well informed could &s;ugge&s;t. Her voice and manner were in a great mea&s;ure accordant to her figure, &s;trong and forcible, but devoid of tho&s;e delicate touches of nature, which Mrs. Barry had accu&s;tomed the Iri&s;h audience to.</P>
<P>Her choice of a character was judicious; Euphra&s;ia in the Grecian Daughter, afforded her various opportunities of di&s;playing her figure and powers to advantage. From her great re|putation, much was expected; and though &s;he did not entirely an&s;wer that expectation, yet &s;he proved a mo&s;t valuable &s;upport both in tragedy and comedy to the cau&s;e &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed, during the remainder of the &s;ea&s;on. Mandane, Ro&s;a|lind,
<PB N="227" REF="241">
Lady Townly, Viola, Sir Harry Wildair, Beatrice, &amp;c. were among&s;t the many charac|ters &s;he performed.</P>
<P>Mr. King's abilities, which were much more confined, lay chiefly in the line in which Mr. Lewis was &s;o far &s;uperior, that few opportuni|ties occurred of his performing. The en&s;uing &s;ummer they compo&s;ed part of Mr. Heaphy's company at Cork, after which they returned to York, where Mr. Wilkin&s;on received them with much plea&s;ure. For &s;everal years pa&s;t they have been &s;ettled off the &s;tage at Lynn, in Norfolk, with much credit and re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>Mr. Macklin and Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, followed Mrs. King, but though in great e&s;timation with the town, yet was their attraction over, and, as is often the ca&s;e in theatrical affairs, merit was obliged to give place to novelty; however, the arrival of the new lord lieutenant, the Earl of Harcourt, in&s;pired them with fre&s;h hopes, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure were gratified. At the commence|ment of his vice regency, he u&s;ed every means to render him&s;elf popular, and among&s;t others, did not neglect that, of courting it at the theatre, which he vi&s;ited once a week for &s;ome time.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="242">But to return to Mr. Ryder, the tide of &s;uc|ce&s;s which continued to follow him with unabated force from his opening the theatre, received an increa&s;e from the return of Mr. Wilks the ori|ginal Je&s;&s;amy, who, after an ab&s;ence of three years came forward once more in his favourite character, and gave new fa&s;hion to this po|pular opera.</P>
<P>Shortly after, the Iri&s;h Widow, then perform|ing in London with much applau&s;e, was produc|ed at both theatres on the &s;ame night, but with far different &s;ucce&s;s. Mrs. Sparks gave &s;uch a captivating, elegant, fini&s;hed portrait of the Widow Brady, as charmed the public, bore down all oppo&s;ition, and added much to her ri&s;ing fame; at Crow-&s;treet it was only performed a few nights, at Smock-alley it was regularly pre|&s;ented every Wedne&s;day, for upwards of eigh|teen weeks to crowded hou&s;es.</P>
<P>In this conte&s;t, tragedy had its &s;hare of pub|lic attention at Smock-alley, where it was re&s;|pectably &s;upported by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Jack|&s;on, Mr. Ryder, (the mo&s;t general actor in tragedy, comedy, opera, and farce, living) Mrs. Fitzhenry, Mrs. Jack&s;on, and Mrs. Sparks.
<PB N="229" REF="243">
The favours he enjoyed, &s;eemed to quicken Mr. Ryder's exertions, and &s;uch a number of new and revived pieces were brought forward in ra|pid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as evinced his activity and in|du&s;try.</P>
<P>A new comic opera called the Mile&s;ian, writ|ten by a Mr. Mc. Dermot, formerly a breeches-maker; (Jones was a bricklayer) but at pre&s;ent, &s;urveyor of Dunleary, was at this time pro|duced, but though it was well acted, yet partly from the author's being unpopular, it was obliged to be laid a&s;ide after the fourth or fifth night.</P>
<P>A new comedy called the South Briton, &s;aid to be the production of a lady, followed, but was not much more favourably received.</P>
<P>Very late in the &s;ea&s;on, the latter end of April, Dr. Gold&s;mith's comedy of She Stoops to Con|quer, was brought out at both theatres; at Crow-&s;treet on a Monday, and at Smock-alley the following evening, but with no great &s;ucce&s;s at either.</P>
<P>At this period a gentleman made his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay on the &s;tage at Smock-alley, who de&s;erves

to be particularly remembered. This was no other than Mr. Pratt, then known by the name of Courtney Melmoth, who&s;e literary fame, and various excellent writings will be remembered as long as a friend to humanity remains. The part he cho&s;e for his appearance was Marc Anthony in All for Love, preceded by a pro|logue of his writing, &s;poken by Mr. Ryder, pre|paratory to his reception, which was as flattering as he could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>In a few nights after he repeated Marc An|tony, and in the remaining part of the &s;ea&s;on, played Publius Horatius in the Roman Father, Lu&s;ignan in Zara, Lord Sali&s;bury, Jaffier, and a few other characters. His &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage, though by no means equal to that in the republic of letters, yet was re&s;pectable. His figure was tall and genteel, his deportment ea&s;y, from his education and knowledge he could not but be a &s;en&s;ible &s;peaker; yet he wanted powers and force.</P>
<P>At his benefit, which was the Orphan, in which he played Ca&s;talio, he introduced Mrs. Melmoth, then in the bloom of life, a beautiful figure, with a remarkably &s;weet voice, to public
<PB N="231" REF="245">
notice In Monimia, a part in which &s;he &s;uc|ceeded &s;o well, as to give every hope &s;he would prove a valuable acqui&s;ition to the &s;tage. Nor was the public judgment di&s;appointed. Mrs. Melmoth's abilities are capable of commanding a re&s;pectable &s;ituation in any theatre.</P>
<P>When the &s;ea&s;on clo&s;ed Mr. Melmoth led a company to Drogheda, where he built a theatre capable of containing about forty pounds when much crowded; it was opened with the Mer|chant of Venice, in which he played Shylock, and Mrs. Melmoth, Portia. After an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful campaign of upwards of three months, he was obliged to relinqui&s;h management, and with it all idea of the &s;tage. This done he re|&s;umed avocations more &s;uitable to his genius, and from time to time produced a variety of pieces that did honour to his head and heart.</P>
<P>To fill up the mea&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s which marked this &s;ea&s;on, we find, what appears re|markably &s;ingular. That though Crow-&s;treet was the theatre-royal, and con&s;equently entitled to every mark of vice-regal favour, yet the lord lieutenant &s;everal times honoured it's oppo|nent with his pre&s;ence, particularly to Mr.
<PB N="232" REF="246">
Ryder's Sir John Re&s;tle&s;s, Mrs. Sparks's Iri&s;h Widow, and Mr. Sheridan's Hamlet.</P>
<P>In the month of May, Mi&s;s Catley, who had been ab&s;ent three years, returned to Smock-alley, with, if po&s;&s;ible, encrea&s;ed attraction, and with "her native wood notes wild," once more charmed an admiring public. She played Ro|&s;etta three times, Polly once, then took a be|nefit, and fini&s;hed with Ephro&s;ine in Comus.</P>
<P>This very long and &s;ucce&s;sful campaign at Smock-alley, clo&s;ed with an eclat equal to its commencement. Mr. and Mrs. Barry, in com|pany with Mr. Francis Aickin from Drury-lane, vi&s;ited Dublin in the month of June.</P>
<P>Owing to &s;ome di&s;pute with Mr. Daw&s;on, who was &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the theatre-royal, and who according to every information, was unfairly, or rather cruelly treated in the matter, they performed a few nights at Mr. Ryder's theatre: but upon Mr. Daw&s;on's relinqui&s;hing Crow-&s;treet, they removed thither, where they fini&s;hed the &s;ea&s;on about the latter end of July, with much advantage to them&s;elves and emolu|ment to the manager.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE the commencement of the next &s;ea&s;on, the Iri&s;h &s;tage was deprived of one of its greate&s;t ornaments; Mr. Lewis, who&s;e attach|ment to Mr. Daw&s;on had hitherto prevented his looking forward to that &s;ituation which his
<PB N="234" REF="248">
merit &s;o highly entitled him to, finding at length, that he was not likely to profit any longer by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, li&s;tened to propo&s;als, and accepted of terms from Covent-garden, where he made his fir&s;t appearance in the character of Belcour, in the We&s;t Indian, on Monday, October 15th, 1773.</P>
<P>His &s;ucce&s;s may be e&s;timated by the honour|able rank he has &s;ince &s;u&s;tained in the drama, which certainly places him among&s;t the fir&s;t and mo&s;t fini&s;hed comedians of the age. The fol|lowing critique on his performance that night which appeared the next day in one of the Lon|don papers, is written with &s;o judicious and di&s;criminating a ta&s;te, as to render it worthy of in&s;ertion. It was as follows:</P>
<P>"La&s;t night was performed, at the theatre-royal, Covent-garden, the comedy of the We&s;t Indian, Belcour by Mr. Lewis from Dublin, being his fir&s;t appearance on this &s;tage."</P>
<P>"On his fir&s;t entrance, the agreeablene&s;s of his figure, and the vivacity of his manner, obtained for him that applau&s;e, which an Engli&s;h audi|ence is ever ready to be&s;tow on the efforts of
<PB N="235" REF="249">
genius. Animated, therefore, by this reception, it took off in a great mea&s;ure, that embarra&s;&s;|ment which too generally clogs the powers of fir&s;t appearances, and left us more at liberty to examine his preten&s;ions to public favour."</P>
<P>"His per&s;on we may pronounce to be a good &s;tage figure, rather above the middle &s;ize, his voice clear, articulate, and commanding, his de|portment graceful and ea&s;y. As the part of Belcour demands great vivacity and &s;pirit, Mr. Lewis filled the whole of it with propriety; judiciou&s;ly &s;teering between the pertne&s;s of the coxcomb, and the dapper manners of low comedy; &s;o that on the whole, we may venture to congratulate the town upon the acqui&s;ition of an actor, who &s;eems to be &s;o able a &s;ucce&s;|&s;or to Mr. O'Brien in the walk of genteel comedy."</P>
<P>I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent, take my leave of this gentleman with the following ob&s;ervation. That as excellence of private character cannot be any di&s;advantage to eminence in public, &s;o does Mr. Lewis enjoy, as much as mo&s;t men living, the happine&s;s that ari&s;es from being univer&s;ally e&s;teemed; and &s;uch has been the peculiar recti|tude
<PB N="236" REF="250">
of his conduct, that he has for years filled one of the mo&s;t difficult &s;tations in life to &s;up|port with credit, and has conducted him&s;elf with &s;o much good &s;en&s;e and propriety, as to defy malice to point out a blemi&s;h.</P>
<P>To return to my &s;ubject&mdash;Mr. Ryder's pro&s;|pects at this time, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, were brilliant, and &s;uch as might ju&s;tify the mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations. The ill &s;ucce&s;s of his com|petitor and his being, though unju&s;tly, deprived of Crow-&s;treet theatre, rendered him, at lea&s;t in Mr. Ryder's opinion, no very formidable rival. Accordingly, after a few nece&s;&s;ary arrangements, he opened Smock-alley theatre on the 27th of September, with She Stoops to Conquer, and the Miller of Mansfield.</P>
<P>The favour of the town, which &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed his former &s;ea&s;on, he continued to enjoy with undimini&s;hed force, and the fo&s;tering hand of public patronage liberally rewarded his endeavours. She Stoops to Conquer, which among&s;t the benefits of la&s;t year, had not a fair chance, was brought out with great care, plea&s;|ed much, and was generally played once a week; Lionel and the Iri&s;h Widow continued &s;till to
<PB N="237" REF="251">
maintain their fa&s;hion, and were played together every Wedne&s;day for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;ea&s;on, Mr. and Mrs. Miel from the theatre-royal Norwich, made their fir&s;t ap|pearance in this kingdom the one in Archer in the Stratagem, the other in Diana in Lionel, and both with a tolerable &s;hare of &s;ucce&s;s. The abilities of the former in light comedy parts, &s;prightly gentlemen, and pert valets were far above medio-Since that, the public have had many opportuni|ties of &s;eeing him &s;upport a re&s;pectable line of bu&s;ine&s;s at different times.</P>
<P>For &s;ome years pa&s;t, he has been manager of an excellent company, who yearly vi&s;it Shrew&s;|bury, Glouce&s;ter, Wolverhampton, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mrs. Miel, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an excellent full toned, powerful voice, without much cultivation, but capable of much improvement.</P>

in the mu&s;ical world, at pre&s;ent &s;he was but little followed, and performed but &s;eldom during the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Comedy of the Macaroni, which I had written at York, in the Summer of 1772, when I had very little knowledge of the drama, but which from it's at that time popular title, and a few other happy circum&s;tances, met with remark|able &s;ucce&s;s in mo&s;t of the provincial theatres in England, was at this time brought forward and performed a few nights. Whether from its want of merit or name, (never having been played in London) or perhaps from both com|bined, it was &s;oon laid a&s;ide to make room for more popular and de&s;erving pieces.</P>
<P>Mr. Ryder having concluded a treaty with Mr. Foote, this exotic arrived in November with Mrs. Jewell then his principal actre&s;s, and in high reputation, and a Mrs. Williams. This acce&s;&s;ion of force did not much increa&s;e the re|ceipts of the theatrical trea&s;ury. They opened in the Maid of Bath, which never had been acted in this kingdom: it was repeated, but with no great effect. Mr. Foote afterwards went through his u&s;ual routine of characters, but &s;till
<PB N="239" REF="253">
under par. His benefit, The Bankrupt, was however a good one.</P>
<P>The latter end of November, Mr. Fletewood, from the Haymarket theatre, made his appearance in Tancred. This Gentleman was of a good family and connections. He had been &s;ome years an officer in the army, where having di&s;&s;i|pated a &s;mall fortune, he embraced the &s;tage as a plea&s;ing and certain re&s;ource; nor was he de|ceived in his expectations. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abili|ties which had he lived to cultivate, would have ornamented the drama.</P>
<P>During the &s;ea&s;on, he played a variety of characters, principally in tragedy, with encrea&s;|ing reputation. On his quitting Smock-alley theatre, he engaged at Liverpool, where he &s;pent the next winter. From thence he repaired to York, where he experienced much kindne&s;s from Mr. Wilkin&s;on and the public. Here his health began to decline, and he died about two years after at Leeds, e&s;teemed and regretted.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan and Mrs. Fitzhenry, who had renewed their engagements with Mr. Ryder, were purpo&s;ely kept as a corps de re&s;erve, 'till
<PB N="240" REF="254">
the enemy, who began to rally from all quarters, and collect to one point, began to grow for|midable, and make their approaches to di&s;pute once more the dramatic crown with the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Though I have not had an opportunity till the pre&s;ent, of mentioning Mr. Daw&s;on's opera|tions for &s;ome time pa&s;t, yet he was far from remaining inactive, during Mr. Ryder's rapid advances. His u&s;ual fertility of genius and indu&s;try, employed each hour in making every di&s;po&s;ition which the nature of his circum&s;tances would admit.</P>
<P>Counteracted in his views re&s;pecting the theatre-royal, he once more had recour&s;e to his fortunate theatre Capel-&s;treet, which on a for|mer occa&s;ion had proved of &s;uch uncommon &s;ervice. This point &s;ettled, he in&s;tantly &s;et about repairing, painting and decorating it with the utmo&s;t diligence.</P>
<P>His company he had collected with every po&s;&s;ible care, and though they were not &s;o nu|merous, nor &s;o high in general e&s;timation, yet were there many of approved merit and re&s;pec|tability.
<PB N="241" REF="255">
Several had de&s;erted in the interim, and in return, &s;everal had been gained from the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>From a variety of untoward incidents, Mr. Daw&s;on found it impo&s;&s;ible to open before Monday, the 23d of November, when the We&s;t Indian was performed in the following manner.</P>

<P>Shortly after, Mr. and Mrs. Simp&s;on from the Norwich theatre, made their entr&egrave; on the Capel-&s;treet &s;tage, in Sir John Melvil and Fanny Sterling in the Clande&s;tine Marriage. Their ar|rival was &s;ea&s;onable, as Mr. Daw&s;on wanted numbers, and the lady was capable of &s;upporting
<PB N="245" REF="259">
a very exten&s;ive line of bu&s;ine&s;s in tragedy, comedy, opera, and farce.</P>
<P>Mr. Simp&s;on was brother to Mrs. Inchbald, at pre&s;ent &s;o celebrated in the literary world. He was very young, tall and genteel, with a good face, but not much accu&s;tomed to the &s;tage, or likely to make any great progre&s;s in a pro|fe&s;&s;ion which requires uncommon endowments, and which his own good &s;en&s;e long &s;ince pointed out the propriety of quitting. Mrs. Simp&s;on, formerly Mi&s;s George, was on the contrary, a mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition; with a delicate ele|gant figure, (but rather under the &s;ize e&s;&s;ential for a large &s;tage) and a beautiful expre&s;&s;ive coun|tenance, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abilities, which have &s;ince commanded the fir&s;t &s;ituation in every theatre &s;he has been in. Towards the end of the &s;ea&s;on, they accepted of an invitation from Mr. Ryder, with whom they remained &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the number of new faces produced at Capel-&s;treet, a Mr. Robin&s;on de&s;erves to be remembered. This gentleman, a native of Dublin, enamoured of the drama, commenced his career in Mungo, in whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> him&s;elf with &s;uch eclat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> re&s;olution

he had taken. In the cour&s;e of a few years that he remained on the &s;tage, I had opportuni|ties of &s;eeing him at York, and at Bri&s;tol, a very valuable and re&s;pectable member of each community. Since then, he has thought proper to re&s;ume the line of life he was originally de|&s;igned for, the law, and he now practices as a barri&s;ter at the Engli&s;h bar, with reputation and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the unequal conte&s;t of this &s;ea&s;on, Mr. Daw&s;on had to encounter many in&s;urmountable difficulties; with a &s;mall theatre, inferior com|pany, and contracted re&s;ource<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had to con|tend again&s;t a great and popular favourite, at the head of a number of excellent performers, crowned with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s, and who&s;e well repleni&s;hed trea&s;ury enabled him to accom|pli&s;h objects beyond the reach of his oppo|nent.</P>
<P>However, that indu&s;try which characterized Mr. Daw&s;on's Management, did not de&s;ert him at this juncture. He got up the Jubilee with much care and co&s;t; in which he introduced Mr. A&s;tley and his performers, then exhibiting in Dublin; this drew him &s;ome money. The

In vain he advertized it in rehear&s;al, with a pro|mi&s;e of pre&s;enting it in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate: the public embraced the fir&s;t opportunity, and it was of material advantage to Mr. Daw&s;on. At length it came forward, &s;anctioned by the Earl of Harcourt, Lord Lieutenant, when it brought &s;even or eight good hou&s;es.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>LET us now turn our eyes on Mr. Ryder, who&s;e pro&s;pects each day brightened, and who&s;e views each day extended. His theatre exhibited a plea&s;ing, bu&s;y, bu&s;tling &s;cene, where crowded hou&s;es &s;weetened nightly toils, and public pa|tronage amply recompen&s;ed each well meant effort. The Lord Lieutenant al&s;o frequently vi&s;ited Smock-alley, and whil&s;t his pre&s;ence
<PB N="251" REF="265">
added fa&s;hion to its circles, increa&s;ed his own popularity.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ical entertainment of the De&s;erter made its fir&s;t appearance in this kingdom at that time, and was mo&s;t favourably received. Its intrin&s;ic merit, plea&s;ing mu&s;ic, and the excel|lence of its performance entitled it to this re|ception. Mrs. Sparks's Loui&s;a was much no|ticed, Mr. Vandermere's Skirmi&s;h added greatly to his reputation.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the variety and novelty produced this &s;ea&s;on were the Sieur Powla&s;kie the Polan|der, Mon&s;ieur Bi&s;&s;ant on the Slack Rope, and an animal company of performers con&s;i&s;ting of three monkies, a hare, a dog, and a hor&s;e, who under the direction of the Sieur Mc. Crow|&s;kie, performed a petite pantomime; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, without any great &s;hare of public approbation: on the contrary, they were &s;oon con&s;igned to places better adapted to &s;uch ex|hibitions, and obliged to give place to enter|tainments more &s;uited to the nature of a theatre.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="266">About this time, a number of gentlemen of the army and navy, a&s;&s;ociated for the laudable and benevolent purpo&s;e of performing a number of plays and farces at Smock-alley, the emolu|ments ari&s;ing to be applied to charitable u&s;es. For the benefit of the Meath ho&s;pital, the Hi|bernian &s;chool, the relief of &s;oldiers wives and children, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign, which was truly noble, fully an|&s;wered each intent. The fir&s;t night of their per|formance was the Con&s;tant Couple and Mi&s;s in her Teens, with an occa&s;ional prologue, writ|ten and &s;poken by Major Riddi&s;dale, when the theatre was &s;o crowded, even behind the &s;cenes, that there was &s;carce room to get on or off; and &s;o highly in the opinion of the audience did the&s;e gentlemen acquit them&s;elves in their re&s;pective characters, that during a repetition of their performance for &s;even or eight nights, the hou&s;e was filled with rank and fa&s;hion. The Stratagem was acted &s;ix nights, The Devil to Pay-often. Among&s;t the gentlemen who di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this honourable and humane occa&s;ion, was Major French, who&s;e theatric abilities &s;tood the te&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t
<PB N="253" REF="267">
critici&s;m. His Scrub and Job&s;on will be long remembered, as excellent pieces of acting.</P>
<P>Mr. O'Keefe, the exuberance of who&s;e fer|tile genius had &s;everal times before manife&s;ted it&s;elf in occa&s;ional jeu d'e&s;prits, and petite pieces, brought out his Tony Lumkin in town for his benefit at this time. This farce was &s;everal years after produced under the au&s;pices of Mr. Colman, in the early part of his manage|ment at the Haymarket, and though it was far from being the be&s;t of his performances, yet it prepared the town for that &s;pecies of dramatic writing, which till then they had been unac|quainted with.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help ob&s;erving, the many obligations the public are under to Mr. Colman, &s;en. for cheri&s;hing, cultivating, and directing a genius which has &s;ince added &s;o much to their entertainment. I think I can venture to affirm, that to the great judgment of this excellent ma|nager, (one of the be&s;t the &s;tage could ever boa&s;t of,) in advi&s;ing, correcting, and preparing Mr. O'Keefe's fir&s;t productions, and in afterwards exhibiting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> perfection,
<PB N="254" REF="268">
we are indebted for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many of the plea&s;ante&s;t pieces that enrich the drama.</P>
<P>The popular dramatic romance of Cymon, always a favourite, was at this time acted with renovated &s;trength. Mr. Michael Arne, the compo&s;er of the mu&s;ic, was at this time in Dublin, and under his direction it was again brought out with great care and attention. Much of the original mu&s;ic was re&s;tored, &s;everal &s;ongs were new &s;et. Mr. Ryder played Cymon; Mr. Wilder, Linco; Mr. Mahon, Merlin; Mr. Vandermere, Ju&s;tice Dorus; Mrs. Pinto, Ur|ganda, Mrs. Sparks, Fatima; and that elegant little warbler, Mrs. Arne, formerly Mi&s;s Wright, made her fir&s;t appearance in this kingdom in Sylvia. Thus powerfully &s;upported, it was highly received and brought &s;everal hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the theatrical candidates of this time, at Smock-alley, Mr. Waddy di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o as to de&s;erve particular notice. His fir&s;t cha|racter was Philotas, in the Grecian Daughter. His &s;ucce&s;s in this induced him afterwards to attempt Dumont in Jane Shore, the duke in Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure, Menes in the new Tragedy of Sethona, Ca&s;&s;ius in Julius Cae&s;ar, and &s;everal
<PB N="255" REF="269">
others, in which he acquired reputation, and was con&s;idered as a promi&s;ing actor.</P>
<P>He continued at Smock-alley for the remainder of the pre&s;ent, and the whole of the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. Hereafter we &s;hall find him an active agent in the fortunes of the new theatre in Fi&s;hamble-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s which Mr. Ryder had experienced, and the weight of public confidence which he enjoyed, in&s;pired him, at this time, with the idea of a new &s;pecies of entertainment. This was a kind of ma&s;qued fancy ball, or ridotto.</P>
<P>Crow-&s;treet theatre had been &s;hut up during the winter, notwith&s;tanding the earne&s;t &s;olicitations of &s;everal per&s;ons to have it opened. But as &s;oon as Mr. Ryder had formed this new &s;cheme, he re&s;olved to fit up this hou&s;e for the occa&s;ion. It was therefore immediately repaired, painted and decorated for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This exhibition, however, appears to have &s;uf|fered very con&s;iderable delays, and to have under|gone many alterations, before it could be brought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> under the title
<PB N="256" REF="270">
of a Fancy Ball, and the plan propo&s;ed was by &s;ub&s;cription. There were to have been &s;ixty &s;ub&s;cribers, at ten guineas a piece, each &s;ub&s;criber to have eight tickets for the admi&s;&s;ion either of ladies or gentlemen.</P>
<P>But, probably from want of &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;ub&s;cription, and finding the plan propo&s;ed not &s;ufficient, it was &s;ome time after, changed. The entertainment was then deferred 'till a later day, and adverti&s;ed under the name of a ridotto ball. Tickets for this were to be had at a guinea each, which in all probability, was found a more pro|ductive plan than that by &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>It was announced as under the &s;anction of the Lord Lieutenant, and Mr. Ryder had the addre&s;s to engage the &s;upport of the Duke of Lein&s;ter, the Counte&s;s of Shannon, Lady Newnham, and many others of the fir&s;t rank. Indeed, the exhibition, at the &s;ame time that it was a matter of plea&s;ure, proved al&s;o a &s;cource of utility, as every per&s;on who was admitted was to be dre&s;&s;|ed in Iri&s;h manufacture.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this project, was &s;uch as might have been expected, from the patronage under
<PB N="257" REF="271">
which it was brought forward. It took place &s;ome time in May. The crowd of per&s;ons of fa&s;hion was &s;o great, that Mr. Ryder was re|ported to have cleared upwards of a thou&s;and guineas by the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Much about this time, we find Mr. A&s;tley and his whole family exhibited in various ways, in Dublin. Among&s;t the re&s;t of his amu&s;ements, Mrs. A&s;tley propo&s;ed to entertain the public by exhibiting a &s;warm of bees upon her arm, &s;o clo&s;ely compacted as to form altogether a &s;trik|ing re&s;emblance to a lady's muff. With his u&s;ual activity, Mr. A&s;tley had al&s;o a mu&s;eum of cu|rio&s;ities, going forward at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>To re&s;i&s;t and in all probability counteract the influence of his exhibitions, the royal forces, be|&s;ides tumblers and rope dancers, received the powerful aid of a great little Phoenomenon, called the Cor&s;ican Fairy. The tragedy of Henry the Eighth was got up, and in the coronation of Anne Bullen, "the part of the Champion" is announc|ed to be performed <Q>by Maria Tere&s;a, the amazing Cor&s;ican Fairy, who will make her public entry riding on the learned hor&s;e, after which &s;he will de&s;cend and move a minuet
<PB N="258" REF="272">
and dance a new Cor&s;ian jigg upon a table. This wonderful phaenomenon is but 34 inche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> high, weighs but 26 pounds, and is allowed by all who have &s;een her, a perfect beauty. She &s;peaks Italian and French with the greate&s;t vivacity and elegance.</Q></P>
<P>However the lovers of <HI>curious &s;ights</HI> might have been gratified by the appearance of this little lady, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the admirers of Shake&s;peare could have no great rea&s;on to re|joice at her introduction into one of his mo&s;t celebrated tragedies. But we mu&s;t be at &s;ome lo&s;s in which point of view mo&s;t to admire the ingenuity of the contrivance, whether in re|gard to the happily &s;uited figure of the cho&s;en champion, or to the appropriate nature of the exhibitions which he was announced to di&s;play. A champion of 34 inches high could at be&s;t in&s;pire us with but little opinion of his prowe&s;s or dignity, but we mu&s;t utterly lo&s;e all &s;ight of both, when we behold him <HI>mounting a table, to dance a Cor&s;ican jigg.</HI></P>
<P>For the con&s;i&s;tency of the proceedings as well as for the gratification of tho&s;e cogno&s;centi who beheld this amu&s;ing spectacle, it is much to be regretted
<PB N="259" REF="273">
that the celebrated little count Borowla&s;ki, was not cotemporary with this lady, to have joined both in the fight and in the dance. The dig|nity of tragedy would then have been uniformly &s;upported.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch are the wretched re&s;ources to which a manager is frequently driven, not from choice, but from nece&s;&s;ity, in order to counteract the rage of &s;ome &s;imilar attraction and to pre|&s;erve public attention.</P>
<P>However, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on amply retrieved it's credit. The number and excellence of the performers who were brought over, was uncommonly great. This will &s;ufficiently appear by the mere repe|tition of their names. They were Mr. and Mrs. Barry, Mr. Aickin, Mr. Dodd and Mrs. Bulkely, and Mr. Smith and Mrs. Hartley.</P>
<P>Nor would it be fair to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the merits of hone&s;t Bob Aldridge. He al&s;o at this time, vi&s;ited his native country, and dur|ing his &s;hort &s;tay, delighted his &s;pectators with all the various excellencies of Iri&s;h grote&s;que dancing: a &s;tile of exhibition, in wich he has never been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="274">But of the &s;everal great names above enu|merated, the &s;ucce&s;s was, as might perhaps have been expected, different. The merit of Mr. Dodd and Mrs. Bulkely was univer&s;ally acknow|ledged. The fir&s;t characters in comedy they had long &s;upported, with the highe&s;t reputation. On this occa&s;ion, however, private con&s;iderations &s;eemed to fru&s;tate public ability. The connec|tion between them was not of the mo&s;t moral kind, and &s;ome recent tran&s;actions had excited &s;trong prejudices again&s;t them.</P>
<P>They made their fir&s;t appearance in Benedict and Beatrice, in which, notwith&s;tanding their confe&s;&s;ed merit, they had the mortification to experience public neglect and inattention.</P>
<P>Exactly in the &s;ame predicament &s;tood Mr. Smith and Mrs. Hartley. Their merits were con&s;iderable; but their &s;ituations were nearly the &s;ame, and their &s;ucce&s;s was proportionate.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith was a gentleman of re&s;pectable family, connections, and education, and of ri&s;ing reputation in his profe&s;&s;ion. His fir&s;t character was King Richard. Mrs. Hartley was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at lea&s;t some of the leading requi&s;ites for
<PB N="261" REF="275">
attraction. She was of a lovely face and an ex|cellent figure, advantages which, with the aid of novelty, might have been expected to have proved &s;ucce&s;sful. But the fate of the&s;e tragic &s;tars was not more au&s;picious than that of the comic luminaries already mentioned.</P>
<P>Perhaps it might be owing to the &s;uperior attraction of Mr. and Mrs. Barry, as much as to any thing el&s;e, that the&s;e failures took place. It has been always experienced, that in Dublin but one object of favour can be &s;upported at one time. In this ca&s;e, it is not to be wondered at, that the very &s;uperior abilities of Mr. and Mrs. Barry, and their e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ame &s;hould have born down all competition.</P>
<P>At all events, &s;uch was the fact. Their fir&s;t appearances were in Lear and Cordelia, two characters than which none, I may venture to &s;ay, were ever more capitally repre&s;ented. They were al&s;o very con&s;iderably &s;upported, in their &s;everal repre&s;entations, by Mr. Francis Aickin, who&s;e abilities have always rendered him an acceptable vi&s;itor on tho&s;e summer excur&s;ions</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="276">During the &s;tay of Mr. and Mrs. Barry and Mr. Aickin they performed mo&s;t of their fa|vourite characters, and with a &s;ucce&s;s which compen&s;ated for any other deficiencies. The coffers of the theatre were amply repleni&s;hed by their acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>With &s;uch performers, and with &s;uch eclat, was the &s;ea&s;on of 1774 concluded, on the 16th of July, with the Grecian Daughter, and Midas, for the benefit of Mr. William Barry, trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>The review of this &s;ea&s;on, will &s;hew it to have been one of the mo&s;t &s;plendid ever known in this kingdom. Whatever might have been the occa&s;ional &s;truggles of the contending par|ties, whatever the di&s;appointment of &s;ome in|dividuals, the public cau&s;e was amply provided for. The entertainments, upon the whole, were excellent, and the emoluments of the prevailing party, very con&s;iderable. At no time has the town been pre&s;ented with a greater variety of excellence: at none, has it more li|berally rewarded it's providers.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="277">Upon the whole, the &s;ea&s;on of 1774 may be &s;aid to have exhibited the Iri&s;h &s;tage in a light of re&s;pectability, which has been &s;eldom equalled, perhaps never excelled.</P>
