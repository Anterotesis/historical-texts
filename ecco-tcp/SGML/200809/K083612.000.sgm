<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t heard of the Skeleton; or, the Arminian Anatomized, &amp;c. I was much di&s;plea&s;ed with the Author's un|charitable &s;pirit; and re&s;olved to an&s;wer his performance. In which I intend to &s;hew the great impropriety of our accu&s;ing and condemning each other for their different opinions.</P>
<P>In &s;ome points of doctrine, my opinion is different from that of Mr. <HI>W. H.</HI> Yet I would not condemn him, while he maintains tho&s;e truths which the mo&s;t experienced
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Chri&s;tians are agreed in: &s;uch as our fall in Adam; our utter helple&s;sne&s;s; Chri&s;t being the only foundation of a &s;inner's hope; the nece&s;&s;ity of our being born again; and ju&s;tification by faith in Chri&s;t, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Under the Author's portrait, is put, "The root of the matter is found in me." What other root is found in him, I will not &s;ay; but I am &s;ure that very much of the root of bitterne&s;s is found in his Book. In the Dedi|cation of his Book, he &s;aith, page 5, "The doctrines I have written, I learned them not of man, but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For I had been &s;ome months in the glo|rious liberty of the Go&s;pel, before I went to hear the Go&s;pel at all."</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, He was never taught to encou|rage &s;uch an uncharitable &s;pirit, by any re|velation he received from Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Be|&s;ides, St. Paul &s;aith, "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." But this Author has found another way to
<PB N="v" REF="4">
receive the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with|out hearing the Go&s;pel!</P>
<P>Again, page 7, he &s;aith, "Ha&s;t thou the faith of God's elect? Let Election be its ba&s;is. Ha&s;t thou a ju&s;tifying faith? Let imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s be its ba&s;is."</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, St. Paul &s;aith 1 Cor. iii. 11, Other foundation can no man lay, than that it laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t." It is Chri&s;t then, and not Election, which is the only foundation of a &s;inner's hope.</P>
<P>The Author adds, "Ha&s;t thou a victorious faith? Thy victory lies in a Saviour's arm," or, "Ha&s;t thou a purifying faith? Then faith fetches its purifying efficacy from a Saviour's blood." The&s;e are truths worth contending for.</P>
<P>Page 8, "God's decrees &s;hall not always be called horrible, nor an everla&s;ting righ|teou&s;ne&s;s be called non&s;en&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
Mr. <HI>H.</HI> cannot prove, that tho&s;e Armi|nians who have received the grace of God in their hearts, call God's decrees, horrible decrees. We mean &s;uch decrees as are con|tained in the &s;criptures; and not what the Author calls, "The &s;ecret decrees of the Mo&s;t High," in his 150th page; or, "The &s;ecret records of Eternity," page 155.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e decrees I ob&s;erve, If they are &s;ecret, they cannot be known; and if they are known they cannot be &s;ecret. It there|fore is perfect non&s;en&s;e to talk of God's &s;ecret decrees, which we ought not &s;o much as to gue&s;s at.</P>
<P>Page 13, he &s;ays, "If God of his infinite mercy keep you from Arminiani&s;m, Ariani&s;m, and Antinomiani&s;m, I &s;hall think you are Chri&s;tians indeed. I rank the errors of Ar|miniani&s;m in the front. However, they are all agreed again&s;t Chri&s;t; the Arminian cries down his merit; the Arian cries down his
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
divinity; and the Antinomian cries down the revelation of him in the heart."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H's</HI> &s;aying that the Arminians cry down the merit of Chri&s;t, is an ab&s;olute fal&s;e|hood, as he him&s;elf knows. But it is no fal&s;e|hood that he cries down the meaning of the apo&s;tle concerning Chri&s;t, "That he, by the grace of God, &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man." Heb. ii. 9, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Remarks on the Skeleton, which treat on Univer&s;al-|Charity, being pur&s;ued, taken, examined, tried, ca&s;t and condemned.</HI></HEAD>
<Q>"Univer&s;al Charity pur&s;ued, and taken."</Q>
<Q>"N. B. Beware of Counterfeits."</Q>
<P>PAGE 1.&mdash;"From what fountain does this Uni|ver&s;al Charity flow? God him&s;elf hath de|clared, <HI>Jacob</HI> have I loved, but <HI>E&s;au</HI> have I hated."</P>
<P>The&s;e words ought to be under&s;tood thus: <HI>Ja|cob</HI> have I loved, but <HI>E&s;au</HI> have I, or comparatively hated. For there are many pa&s;&s;ages in &s;cripture that mu&s;t be thus under&s;tood: as Luke xiv. 26, "If any man come to me, and <HI>hate</HI> not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and &s;i&s;ters, yea and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple." And tho&s;e words of our Lord mu&s;t be thus taken, or they will contradict what St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, Eph. v. 25, "Hu&s;bands love your wives, even as Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the Church, and gave him&s;elf for it."</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8">
Page 2. Mr.<HI>H.</HI> &s;ays of Univer&s;al Charity, "This un&s;criptural love appeared in <HI>Jezebel</HI> the queen. She fed four hundred prophets of Satan at her own table but would not &s;uffer a &s;ound prophet of God to live. When the judgments of God fell on her favourites. Satan's offspring, &s;he would expo&s;e her &s;oul to all the vengeance of heaven, in avenging their blood.&mdash;The gods do &s;o to me and more al&s;o, if the life of <HI>Elijah</HI> (the Calvini&s;t) be not as one of them by to-morrow about this time."</P>
<P>Here Mr.<HI>H.</HI> has told us &s;omething new, in call|ing <HI>Elijah</HI> a Calvini&s;t, who lived &s;ome thou&s;and years before <HI>Calvin.</HI></P>
<P>Page 3.&mdash;"It appears to me, both her title, with all her religion, came from hell; and &s;he &s;eems in &s;cripture, the queen of a rebellious I&s;rael, the mi&s;tre&s;s of witchcraft, the nur&s;e of wizards, a murderer of &s;aints, an enemy to Chri&s;t, a banquet for dogs, and a portion for devils."</P>
<P>This is certainly a ju&s;t character of that wicked and bloody queen, and de&s;criptive of her ju&s;t puni&s;hment: but that Univer&s;al Charity appeared in her mu&s;t be a mi&s;take, for &s;he was filled with partial charity, in favour of her idol <HI>Baal,</HI> and his wicked prie&s;ts. Again.</P>
<P>"All operations that beget hard thoughts of Chri&s;t, rebellion again&s;t him, or le&s;&s;ens in the lea&s;t our e&s;teem of him comes from hell."</P>
<P>I an&s;wer. To &s;uppo&s;e that God has decreed the far greate&s;t part of mankind to eternal damnation, without any po&s;&s;ibility of their e&s;caping it, is one of tho&s;e operations that help to beget hard thoughts of Chri&s;t: and to make him appear a le&s;s valuable Saviour than he is declared to be in the word of God &s;o that according to Mr. <HI>H.</HI> they mu&s;t both come from hell becau&s;e they le&s;&s;en our e&s;teem of Chri&s;t, who is the Saviour of all men; e&s;pecially of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e that believe. 1 Tim. iv. 10.</P>
<P>The author &s;peaking of <HI>David,</HI> page 8, &s;ays, when &s;eventy thou&s;and of the people were de|&s;troyed in three days by the pe&s;tilence; "At the fight of this, Univer&s;al Charity &s;teps into the heart
<PB N="3" REF="9">
of <HI>David,</HI> and a&s;ks an irreverent que&s;tion. How|ever, when <HI>David</HI> got a little more into his right mind, he &s;eems to drop his affection for idolatry, and let them centre on their proper object." "Do not I hate them that hate thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies."</P>
<P>It &s;eems more proper to &s;ay, <HI>David</HI> returned thanks to God for the removal of the pe&s;tilence, than to expre&s;s his hatred again&s;t any per&s;ons at that time. Nor do we know that <HI>David</HI> was ever charged with idolatry, though Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;ays, he had an affection for it.</P>
<P>Again, "<HI>Paul</HI> &s;eems to be caught in this web, I could, &s;ays he, wi&s;h my&s;elf accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t, for my brethren's &s;ake, who are I&s;raelites according to the fle&s;h."</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle could not with him&s;elf &s;o accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t, as to be cut off from him and all his benefits; but rather, that he could wi&s;h him&s;elf crucified as Chri&s;t was, if that would be of any avail in behalf of his brethren, according to the fle&s;h; for it is written, Cur&s;ed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</P>
<P>"It appears to me. &s;ays Mr. <HI>H.</HI> that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was for a time taken in this &s;nare, when in the wilder|ne&s;s, I&s;rael had made a calf, danced round it, and wor&s;hipped it; and they mu&s;t all be pardoned to a man, in an&s;wer to a petition put up by Univer|&s;al Charity; and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> returned unto the Lord, and &s;aid, O the&s;e people have &s;inned a great &s;in: yet now if thou will forgive their sin, if not, blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou ha&s;t written."</P>
<P>This petition of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was put up for the peo|ple, the next day after they had danced before the calf; for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;o angry with them on that day, that he bid the &s;ons of <HI>Levi</HI> &s;tay every man his brother, &amp;c. Accordingly there fell of the people that day, three thou&s;and men: &s;o that they mu&s;t all be pardoned to a man, is quite a wrong account of the matter. Nor doth it ap|pear, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> meant any other, by being blotted
<PB N="4" REF="10">
out of God's book, than being taken out of this life, as appears by the Lord's an&s;wer: "Who&s;o|ever hath &s;inned again&s;t me, him will I blot out of my book," which accordingly came to pa&s;s; for they all died in the wilderne&s;s, as did <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> afterwards for his &s;inning. <HI>Abraham,</HI> the father of the faithful, petitioned for Sodom and Gomor|rah, and was not blamed for &s;o doing; nor does the Lord here blame <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for praying in behalf of the people, though his petition was not granted.</P>
<P>"I believe, &s;ays Mr. <HI>H.</HI> that petition in the Common-prayer-book to come from the &s;ame quarter; That it may plea&s;e thee to have mercy upon all men. Chri&s;t prayed not for the world, but for them that his Father had given him out of the world."</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, 1 Tim. ii. 1, I exhort, that fir&s;t of all, &s;upplications, prayers, and interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men. It is therefore plain, that we are to pray for all men. As for Chri&s;t not praying for the world, <HI>at the time,</HI> it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that he was <HI>then</HI> praying for his apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples, and therefore he did not then include the unbelieving world in his petitions. But if we con&s;ider, that he had commanded his di&s;ciples to pray for their enemies, and prayed him&s;elf for his per&s;ecutors, that his Father would forgive them, what can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;ay that Chri&s;t &s;hould ta&s;te death for <HI>every man,</HI> Heb. ii. 9, and give him&s;elf a ran&s;om <HI>for all,</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 6. And yet never to pray for them?</P>
<P>Page 7.&mdash;"It appears to me. &s;ays Mr. <HI>H.</HI> that this Univer&s;al Charity was the door by which the whole troop of hypocrites crept into the primitive Church. Thou &s;ee&s;t brother <HI>Saul,</HI> how many Jews believe, and are all zealous of the law. Thou mu&s;t &s;ay the four men with thee have a vow on them, then purify thy&s;elf with them. This is to e&s;tabli&s;h what Chri&s;t came to aboli&s;h. This is reconciling the world and the elect to|gether."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">
Note, It was St. <HI>James,</HI> and the elders with him. who advi&s;ed St. <HI>Paul</HI> to puri&s;y him&s;elf with the four men; &s;ee Acts xxi. Certainly then the apo&s;tle and elders knew what was &s;it to be done, without e&s;tabli&s;hing what Chri&s;t came to de&s;troy, or reconciling the world and the elect together, contrary to the truth, full as well as Mr. <HI>H.</HI></P>
<P>Page 8. &mdash;" But their coun&s;el for peace, God turned into war; and <HI>Paul</HI> paid dear enough for it."</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;hewn what he was to &s;uffer at Jeru&s;alem, by the prophet <HI>Agabus.</HI> Acts xxi. 10, 11. And if it was by the decrees of God, that he &s;hould do as he did, and &s;uffer for it, who can help it? Is it not wrong, to find fault with the children of God, for doing what he has predeter|mined they &s;hould do?</P>
<P>Again, "God &s;hews us in his word, &s;ays Mr. <HI>H.</HI> the unalterable doctrines of his &s;ervants; and among all the temptations with which they &s;cem to be tried, this to Univer&s;al Charity was none of the lea&s;t. I had an experience of this temptation my&s;elf, for five and twenty years at lea&s;t; and for two years I &s;eldom was free one minute. I was tempted to believe Satan made the world: I was tempted al&s;o to pray to Satan. Having been long tempted with &s;uch things as the&s;e, to drown my&s;elf in the Thames, and many more too ba&s;e to mention."</P>
<P>I believe he cannot find in the &s;cripture, that any complained of being tempted to Univer&s;al Charity, and that it was a temptation to &s;in. That he might be tempted as above I do not deny. But is it not &s;trange to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch temptations were the fruits of Univer&s;al Charity? Particu|larly to be tempted to believe that Satan made the world, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"Being at la&s;t cha&s;ed from all confidence in my&s;elf, I was at la&s;t obliged to throw away my Whole Duty of Man, and my Common-prayer-|book al&s;o: and to betake my&s;elf to calling on Chri&s;t alone; though my prayer was with words
<PB N="6" REF="12">
of one de&s;perate, yet Chri&s;t delivered me. My &s;in, guilt, &amp;c. took their &s;light at once, and Satan with them. Chri&s;t with all his &s;alvation, beauty, grace, and glory came into my &s;oul in a minute."</P>
<P>This was a wonderful change indeed. But why he threw away his Whole Duty of Man, and his Common-prayer-book, he has not told us. He might think they would reprove him. by &s;hewing, that it was no part of the Whole Duty of Man, nor agreeable to the Common-prayer, to rail at, or revile, and &s;lander others.</P>
<P>At this time, &s;aid he, I had never heard the go&s;|pel. nor did for &s;ome months after. I now law my eternal election &s;ure; Satan now could not invade me as an a&s;&s;ailant: but he came as a vi&s;itor, to endeavour to &s;poil this bright work, by turning me into an Arminian."</P>
<P>It is a wonder how this author can pretend to be a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s. when he is guilty of &s;uch untruths; what, did he never hear the &s;cripture read at Church, or el&s;ewhere, before the time he &s;peaks of? If he did, then his a&s;&s;ertions are fal&s;e. As for his eternal election being &s;ure, that will be be&s;t known at the great day of ac|counts. But Satan's endeavouring to turn him into an Arminian, &s;eems to be the product of his own fancy, and as ablurd, as his e&s;teeming tho&s;e to be temptations to Univer&s;al Charity, when he was tempted to pray to Satan, and to drown him|&s;elf. If Satan could not &s;pced in attempting to turn him into an Arminian (if that was Satan's work.) yet we doubt he has &s;ped full as well another way, by leading him into a party &s;pirit, and unchri&s;tian zeal.</P>
<P>Page 10. he &s;ays, "He fir&s;t &s;et me to look at the whole troop of phari&s;ees who attended tho Church: e&s;pecially the communicants: I con|verted with &s;everal of them; but found them all blind. Having &s;hed &s;ome thou&s;ands of tears over them, I was tempted to view the profane, the heathens, and the blacks, and then it was &s;ug|ge&s;&s;ed unto me, What do&s;t thou think of election
<PB N="7" REF="13">
now? Here I began to wage war again&s;t the &s;o|vereignty of my Maker, and wept for tho&s;e which I never &s;aw,"</P>
<P>So here he was tempted, as he calls it, to Uni|ver&s;al Charity, and he might have wept, pitied and prayed for the phari&s;ees, the profane, the heathens, and blacks, without being blamed for &s;o doing, whether they were &s;aved or not. As we are exhorted to pray for all men, God would not have been angry with him for this kind of charity; for there is no pa&s;&s;age in the Bible that forbids any per&s;ons from praying for &s;uch, nor yet that forbids them to weep for, or pity them. If he waged war again&s;t the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Maker, re&s;pecting his creatures, this was a great crime; and far from Univer&s;al Charity, which acquie&s;ces in God's appointments, and doth not think that any per&s;ons are lo&s;t for want of grace, according to the &s;everal di&s;pen&s;ations in which God has been plea&s;ed to place them; but for the final abu&s;e thereof, by continuing to &s;in again&s;t the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, John i. 9. How God gives his grace and Holy Spirit to tho&s;e per&s;ons who have never heard the go&s;pel, we cannot &s;ee at pre&s;ent; yet we ought to judge, not according to appear|ance, but judge righteous judgment. John vii. 24. And as there have been per&s;ons &s;aved before either the go&s;pel or the law was proclaimed in the world, we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to believe that the &s;ame divine power worketh now as it did then, among tho&s;e who had never heard either of them. Mr.<HI>H.</HI> &s;ays, "Chri&s;t, with all his &s;alvation, beauty, grace and glory, came into my &s;oul in a minute. At this time I had never heard the go&s;|pel, nor did I for &s;ome months after." If &s;o, why may not the heathens, &amp;c. receive Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation in the &s;ame manner?</P>
<P>He goes on, "After this the hard &s;tate of bea&s;ts was repre&s;ented to me, how hard they fared, and yet were never to be &s;aved. And I thought I had more mercy than even God him&s;elf. I felt a
<PB N="8" REF="14">
heart ri&s;ing with malice again&s;t God, Chri&s;t, his &s;overeign grace, his elect, and all that held elec|tion. Long did I carry on this dreadful rebel|lion again&s;t God, and yet mourned and wept over bea&s;ts, creeping things and in&s;ects; but no feeling for a &s;uffering Saviour."</P>
<P>He then acted as wrong again&s;t the Calvini&s;ts in his mind, as he does now openly again&s;t the Arminians; but he mo&s;tly act&s; on the extreme either way, or he would not have wrote in &s;uch a manner as he has done again&s;t the children of God, contrary to our Lord's words, Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the law and the prophets, Matt. vii. 12.</P>
<P>"The next &s;tep I took, &s;ays he, in this won|derful progre&s;s, was to con&s;ider the fallen angels, who, I knew, were excluded from all hope in God, and that for ever." Page 11. &mdash;"Soon my bowels began to yearn for them, and I was now pitying the infernal adver&s;ary of God and man; and fighting again&s;t my God. I went &s;o far in this &s;nare, as to determine to ca&s;t off all hope in God, &s;uppo&s;ing eternal damnation to be my doom: this is the very root of Arminiani&s;m, and I know what fruit it bears."</P>
<P>Here again he runs into an extreme by pitying the fallen angels; and into de&s;pair of God's mercy. But the pitying of devils, and the ca&s;t|ing off all hopes in God, and fighting again&s;t him, he &s;ays, "is the very root of Arminiani&s;m." If this is the root, the fruit mu&s;t be very bad. But we will con&s;ider this a little farther, and &s;ee if it be &s;o or not.</P>
<P>The Arminians believe that Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man, then they need not de&s;pair of God's mercy, nor ca&s;t off all hope in him; nor need they &s;uppo&s;e eternal damnation to be their doom, except they continue in &s;in and unbelief; for they believe, that God willeth not that any &s;hould peri&s;h; but that the wicked turn from his evil ways and live; &s;o that to de&s;pair of God's
<PB N="9" REF="15">
mercy in Chri&s;t is no root of Arminiani&s;m. As for their having pity for devils, this charge &s;eems to be wrong, becau&s;e they believe that all the fallen angels, and all mankind, who finally reject the grace of God, de&s;erve no pity; for they think, that if the devils, and all mankind who &s;in away their day of grace, did not ju&s;tly de&s;erve eternal puni&s;hment, God would not puni&s;h them with it. If fighting again&s;t God. by &s;in, is accounted the root of Arminiani&s;m; this the Arminians con|demn, as well as him&s;elf, and affirm, that this evil root, as it &s;prang from Adam, is the root of all evil, and the fruit thereof is very bad in all, until they are renewed by grace.</P>
<P>"However, &s;ays he, God in an&s;wer to prayer delivered me, and I went back to my dear ma&s;ter, wept over him, loved him as a friend, and left heathens, brutes, and devils to &s;hift for them|&s;elves." Now he runs into another extreme; for brutes may peri&s;h, and the heathens fall into de|&s;truction with the devils for any pity or care he &s;eems to have for them. Though he may let the brutes and devils alone unpitied, yet &s;urely the poor heathens might have &s;ome part in his pity and prayers, without a crime; but his &s;pirit &s;eems quite far from that, and from what our Lord's was, when he wept over Jeru&s;alem.</P>

<P>The &s;criptures have informed us, that Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, and that he is the propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world, &s;ee 1 Tim. ii. 6. and l John ii. 2. From the&s;e, and other pa&s;&s;ages, we declare that Chri&s;t died for all mankind, whether they are in hell or not: and except Mr. <HI>H.</HI> can &s;hew us a pa&s;&s;age in the Bible,

But ought it not rather to be an offence to us. when we hear any preacher &s;ay, Chri&s;t; did not die for all, did not ta&s;te death for every man?</P>
<P>"All the enemies this Univer&s;al Charity has, appears to be only God's &s;overeign, electing love to his cho&s;en; Chri&s;t's particular redemption of his people, and the Holy Gho&s;t's &s;overeign and di&s;criminating operations of the called of God."

<P>We do not believe that God is a partial being; but that all his ways are equal. It is men that are partial; not God. As for Chri&s;t's particular redemption, that remains to be proved; but as the &s;cripture &s;aith. He ta&s;ted death for every man, then univer&s;al redemption mu&s;t &s;tand of cour&s;e.

<P><PB N="11" REF="17">
I believe each Arminian who is endued with divine grace, does highly approve of, and loves all God's acts of grace, and the cho&s;en of God; but he does not believe that God's acts of grace are like the acts of a tyrant, commanding things to be done that he knows are impo&s;ible, and then &s;end them to hell for not doing them. Can it be ju&s;t in God to &s;end any per&s;on to hell for not flying up to heaven? For this is no more im|po&s;&s;ible than tho&s;e other things are. As for the cho&s;en of God, the renewed Arminian knoweth, that all who are renewed and born again of the Spirit of God, and who per&s;evere to the end, are the cho&s;en of God; and them he loves as his brethren, let them be of what denomination they will; or he could not with propriety be called a univer&s;al lover, or a per&s;on of univer&s;al charity.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> adds, "A woman told me, that a cer|tain preacher threw the gates of heaven wide open: I then told her &s;he ought to be damned if &s;he boa&s;ted of power to enter in, and yet &s;taid out. Another told me. I barred the gates of heaven; but Mr. Univer&s;al Charity opened them to all. I told her if he did, there was none let in but God's elect; for all that are there, are called, and cho&s;en, and faithful." Rev. xvii. 14.</P>
<P>If Univer&s;al Charity opens the gates of heaven to all, then he acts according to our Lord's com|mi&s;&s;ion, Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature. Mark xvi. 15. But if Mr. <HI>H.</HI> thinks otherwi&s;e, let him fear le&s;t he falls under the condemnation mentioned in Matt. xxiii. 13. Of &s;hutting the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men. But he &s;ays, all who are in heaven, "Are called, and cho&s;en, and faithful." According to this, the&s;e elect are fir&s;t called, before they are cho&s;en, and they are faithful, not continuing in &s;in that grace may abound; but faithful unto death, that they may obtain the crown of life. In the author's 14th, and following pages, he &s;peaks of a man who "appeared to walk like an angel, &amp;e." This man, he &s;ays &s;o offended him,
<PB N="12" REF="18">
as to cau&s;e him to be "&s;o &s;evere again&s;t that doc|trine," "the Arminian labyrinth," as he calls it.</P>

<P>Though this man appeared to walk like an an|gel; vet he repre&s;ents him as dealing with his con&s;cience as a thief, and labouring to bring his &s;o il from Chri&s;t, and expounding to him the way of the god of this world. How this was I can|not tell: but I think we mu&s;t not be too forward to give credit to this author in what he &s;ays con|cerning any controver&s;y he is engaged in.</P>
<P>Here let us ob&s;erve the oddne&s;s of his notions in &s;aying, "I had improved the day of grace my|&s;elf, and falling away was a truth; for I was already fallen." Did he think, that not to im|prove the day of grace is the be&s;t way to keep us from falling? If &s;o his thoughts are contrary to 2 Pet. i. 10. where we are taught to Give all dili|gence to make our calling and election &s;ure: bc|cau&s;e if we do the&s;e things we &s;hall never fall.</P>
<P>Again, "The &s;cripture &s;ays, No man can come to me except the Father draw him. If you can find a pa&s;&s;age in &s;cripture where it is &s;aid, a man has a power to come, then you may prove the Bible lies."</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, The Bible tells us that many re&s;ist the Holy Gho&s;t, by who&s;e influence they might come to God. It al&s;o &s;ays, They will not come unto Chri&s;t that they may have life. It is true, we have not power of our&s;elves to come unto him: but by his power given unto us we may do it. But does God give this power unto any who reject his grace, or does he not? If he does, then their condemnation is ju&s;t; if not they cannot abu&s;e the grace they never had. I believe it never was proved that God refu&s;ed this grace to
<PB N="13" REF="19">
any; but offers it freely unto all. But who are the per&s;ons whom God denies his grace and mercy to! If they cannot be found, is it not bla&s;|phemous to declare, that God is not loving to all and that his tender mercies are not over all his works?</P>
<P>Again, "God has an undeniable right to &s;et this impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k, to put away their evil, make them&s;elves a new heart, learn to do well, make them&s;elves clean, &amp;c. and as a ju&s;t God, damn them for not performing that ta&s;k."</P>
<P>God has no where &s;aid, that he has any &s;uch right over mankind; nor hath he told us, that it is ju&s;t in him, to damn any per&s;on for not per|forming an impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k. For he will not lay upon man more than right, job xxxiv. 23. Nor do I believe that God commands that of men, which he doth not give power to perform.</P>
<P>Page 18. &mdash;"Chri&s;t gives them a new heart, a new &s;pirit, and promi&s;es that they &s;hall never depart from him." Ezck. xxxvi. 27. In all this chapter there are no &s;uch words, as, they &s;hall never depart from him. "This was the privi|lege of a &s;on, the other the ta&s;k of a &s;ervant; and the &s;on is to abide in the hou&s;e for ever: but the &s;ervant is to be kicked out of doors."</P>
<P>This is a fal&s;e quotation: the words are, "Ca&s;t out the bond-woman and her &s;on." And &s;o far is God from kicking his &s;ervants out of doors, that he has declared quite the contrary con|cerning them; &s;o Rev. vii. 3. Till we have &s;ealed the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of God in their forehead, and xix. 2. 5. And hath avenged the blood of his <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> prai&s;e our God, all ye his <HI>&s;ervants.</HI> And Chri&s;t faith, If any man <HI>&s;erve</HI> me. let him follow me, and where I am, there &s;hall my <HI>&s;ervant</HI> be; if any man <HI>&s;erve</HI> me, him will my Father honour, John xii. 26.</P>
<P>"The&s;e things &s;aith Mr. <HI>H.</HI> made the &s;cale of Arminiani&s;m move up; but eternal Election came down full weight. This brought me out of the

Arminian fog, and truth &s;hined in my heart like a comet."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;aying, that truth &s;hined in his heart like a comet, is a very fit compari&s;on; for a comet, is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;hed abroad baleful and malignant influences where it comes; it is al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be a world on fire, and though it carries a long gilt train with it, yet it blazes but for a little while, it being &s;oon over and gone: and though it is looked upon with wonder by the gazing world, yet it does no good to any, that we know of. Such &s;eems to be the nature of tho&s;e fancies that Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;aid &s;hined in his heart.</P>
<P>Again, Page 19. &mdash;"From that moment I waged war with Arminiani&s;m. and if God &s;pares my life a hundred years longer, I hope he will employ me in this battle, and let me die in this fight: and I am fully per&s;uaded I &s;hall never doubt of its being the battle of the Lord."</P>
<P>So he hopes to be employed if he lives one hun|dred years in this battle, and die in the fight, of hatred, ill-will, and malice again&s;t all tho&s;e who di&s;&s;er from him, as if his opinions alone were in|fallibly true, and all others undoubtedly fal&s;e. Is this "following peace with all men!" If he thinks it is the battle of the Lord's, and that his opinions are according to truth, yet, in de&s;ending them, he ought to proceed in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, &s;eeing the wrath of man, worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God."</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e per&s;ons who had di&s;puted with him, he &s;ays, "I have often been enabled to &s;top their mouths, when they have been contending for good works in point of merit, by &s;etting my works again&s;t theirs." They did nothing "but eavil, and yet boa&s;ted of merit; and I have &s;ometimes told them. my works would weigh down the works of fifty of the&s;e Arminian Trunk-makers."</P>
<P>Empty boa&s;t! But his &s;aying they contended for good works in point of merit, I believe to be ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; for it has been often ob&s;erved, when any per&s;on in&s;i&s;ted, that faith without good

works was nothing worth; they of Mr. <HI>H's</HI> party would charge them with contending for the merits of works, when they only meant that good works were nece&s;&s;ary in point of obedience, and as a proof of the truth of our faith, according to Titus ii. and James ii. &amp;c.</P>
<P>"When they have been contending with me, &s;ays Mr. <HI>H.</HI> for final apo&s;tacy from grace, I have told them, their faith was not the gift of God, nor the faith of God's elect."</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient that the Scripture hath fore|warned us again&s;t, final apo&s;tacy, as Ezek. xxxiii. 13. 18. Heb. 4. 1. Rom. xi. 20, 21, 22. The&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages Mr. <HI>H.</HI> declares, to believe them, is not the gift of God, nor the faith of God's elect!</P>
<P>"According to their faith, be it unto them, I believed I never &s;hould," (fall away) "and ac|cording to my faith, it would be unto me. God is not bound to keep them, on in his &s;trength who reject his omnipotent arm."</P>
<P>Here let Mr. <HI>H.</HI> con&s;ider, The fooli&s;h virgins believed they &s;hould have been admitted, when they &s;aid, Lord, Lord, open to us, Matt. xxv. ii. But they were di&s;appointed; though they might fancy, that according to their faith it would be done to them. Likewi&s;e in Matt, vii. 22. Many will &s;ay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy name? and in thy name ca&s;t out devils? and in thy name done many wonder|ful works? The&s;e no doubt, may fancy it will be done to them according to their faith: but they will be mi&s;taken, as our Lord has &s;hewed, ver. 23, for they will then be rejected contrary to their faith. There are many that believe, they &s;hall go to heaven, (although they continue in &s;in,) as well as tho&s;e who reprove them for their wicked lives, and of this they &s;ay, there is not the lea&s;t doubt; for God is merciful. Yet we know it will not be done to them according to this their faith; for except they are born again, they will certainly peri&s;h. St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, 2 Cor. xiii. 2. Though I have faith, &s;o that I could remove
<PB N="16" REF="22">

Does not this militate again&s;t Mr. <HI>H.</HI> who boa&s;ts of faith; but appears to have but little, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o charity, which is the bond of perfectne&s;s? As "God is not bound to keep them, who reject his omnipotent arm." So he is not bound to prevent their falling, who dare a&s;&s;ert that it is impo&s;&s;ible to fall finally from grace, and yet go on in &s;in; as tho&s;e per&s;ons do, who &s;lander and vili&s;y others, for holding different opinions from them. I think &s;uch are fallen already, and are acting contrary to our Lord's words, Thou &s;halt not tempt the Lord thy God: who neverthele&s;s are tempting him by uncharitable cen&s;ures, under a notion of it being impo&s;&s;ible to fall finally away.</P>

<P>Page 32. &mdash;"Thou would&s;t do as Chri&s;t did; he gave them &s;trong meat fir&s;t; rejoice that your names are written in heaven." Luke x. 20.

See Heb. v. 12, 13, 14. and xiii. 9. Our Lord's &s;ermon on the Mount gives a plain account of his religion, but not of his di&s;ciples' names being written in heaven, which no pa&s;&s;age in Scripture calls &s;trong meat. Nor was this our Lord's fir&s;t doctrine; for in Matt. iv. 17. it is &s;aid, From that time Je&s;us began to preach, and to &s;ay, repent; for the king|dom of heaven is at hand. Then according to this, Repentance was his fir&s;t doctrine.</P>

<P>And fir&s;t, Rom. viii. 28, &amp;c. We know that all things work together for good to them that love God. They are tho&s;e who keep his command|ments, as 1 John v. 3. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments. Such are called of God according to his purpo&s;e, who&s;e purpo&s;e is to call all men from their &s;ins, unto him&s;elf. Ver. 29, For whom he did foreknow, he al&s;o did prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, &amp;c. Here the decree of prede&s;tination is, that we &s;hould be conformed to the image of Chri&s;t, in whom was no &s;in: to walk as He walked in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s all our
<PB N="22" REF="28">
days. Ver&s;e 30, "Moreover whom he did pre|de&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called, &amp;c." This is the method God u&s;es in bringing &s;inners to him&s;elf, for whom he foreknew would obey his call, them he prede&s;tinated to be conformed to the image of his Son. The Spirit of God fir&s;t calls &s;inners; in the next place they obey the call, and then they are ju&s;tified by faith; and on their enduring to the end, are glorified. From the remaining part of the chapter, the reader may &s;ee, that not the power of any creature, either in earth or hell, nor any trials of our faith, that God &s;uffereth to befal us, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. Here is mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed encouragement, for every tempted &s;oul, when buffeted by Satan, and tried by cruel mockings, &s;courgings, bonds, impri&s;onments, &amp;c. all the&s;e things will prevail nothing, as long as he re&s;i&s;ts the devil, and &s;trives again&s;t &s;in; for &s;in only can &s;eparate us from the love of God. See I&s;a. lix. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>In Heb. xiii. 5. it is &s;aid, "I will never leave thee nor for&s;ake thee." See Jo&s;hua i. 5. This promi&s;e we may &s;afely re&s;t upon, if we do not leave, nor for&s;ake God, of which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> cautions the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Deut. iv. There are many other places in holy writ that &s;hew forth the loving kindne&s;s of the Lord to tho&s;e who con|tinue to &s;erve him. But if we, like the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> turn a&s;ide from &s;erving the Lord, and continue in &s;in as many of them did, then he will remember our &s;ins again&s;t us, for he hateth all the workers of iniquity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next point out &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages that &s;hew the po&s;&s;ibility of falling away. As Ezek. xxxiii. 13. When I &s;hall &s;ay to the righteous, that he &s;hall &s;urely live; if he tru&s;t to his own righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and commit iniquity; all his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall not be remembered: but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he &s;hall die for it, and ver&s;e 18. When the righteous turneth from his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and committeth iniquity, he &s;hall
<PB N="23" REF="29">
even die thereby. The&s;e texts &s;hew plainly that when the Lord hath &s;aid to the righteous, (&s;uch as he him&s;elf here calls righteous) that he &s;hall &s;urely live, if even &s;uch a per&s;on commits ini|quity, he &s;hall die thereby.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of him, that turneth from his iniqui|ties; Ezek. xviii. 22. All his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that he hath committed, they &s;hall not be mentioned unto him; in his righteou&s;ne&s;s that he hath done, he &s;hall live. Here it is called his righteou&s;ne&s;s in which he &s;hall live, as was the above righte|ou&s;ne&s;s from which he might fall; &s;o that the righteou&s;ne&s;s mentioned in each place is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In 2 Chron. xv. 2. Hear ye me, <HI>A&s;a,</HI> and all <HI>Juda.</HI> and <HI>Benjamin.</HI> The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you; but if ye for&s;ake him, he will for|&s;ake you. This pa&s;&s;age &s;hews, that though the Lord &s;aith, I will never leave thee nor for&s;ake thee, that it is to be under&s;tood, if we do not leave, nor for&s;ake him: which if we do, we have no cau&s;e to &s;ay, he will not for&s;ake us. 2 Tim. ii. 12, 13. If we &s;uffer we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him; if we deny him, he will deny us: if we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Rom. xi. 20, 22. Concerning the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of God, Towards thee goodne&s;s, if thou continue in his goodne&s;s, otherwi&s;e thou al&s;o &s;halt be cut off. St. <HI>Paul</HI> faith, 1 Cor. ix. 27. I keep under my body, and bring it into &s;ubjection, lea&s;t that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away. This &s;heweth, that his being a ca&s;t-away is po&s;&s;ible, ac|cordingly he provide again&s;t it, by keeping his body in &s;ubjection to the will of God. St. <HI>Peter</HI> al&s;o giveth warning thereof in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle, ii. 20, 21. For after they have e&s;caped the pollu|tions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t: they are again in|tangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is wor&s;e with them than the beginning. For it had
<PB N="24" REF="30">
been better for them not to have known the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. And in 2 Pet. chap. i. ver. 4&mdash;10, which the reader may &s;ee, are given a catalogue of di|vine graces: and the apo&s;tle faith, "If the&s;e things be in you and abound, they make you that ve &s;hall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but he that lacketh the&s;e things is blind, and can|not &s;ee afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old &s;ins, wherefore the rather, brethren, give all diligence to make your calling and el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on &s;ure, for if ye do the&s;e things, ye &s;hall never fall."</P>
<P>The author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> &s;peaks in very ex|pre&s;s terms of falling away, and peri&s;hing, &s;ee chap. iv. 1: and vi.4. &mdash;8: and x. 26. &mdash;29: and 38th ver&s;es. In Matt. xviii. 23. &amp;c. Our Lord likens the kingdom of heaven, to a certain king, who would take an account of his &s;ervants. One of which owed him ten thou&s;and talents: but as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be &s;old, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The &s;ervant therefore fell down and wor&s;hipped him, &s;aying lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all: then the lord moved with com|pa&s;&s;ion, forgave him the debt. We here &s;ee that the &s;ervant was fully and freely forgiven. But though he was forgiven, he falls from that &s;tate of grace, and demands of his fellow-&s;ervants a &s;mall debt of an hundred pence, who fell down at his feet, and be&s;ought him, in the &s;ame words he him&s;elf had u&s;ed before to his lord; but he would not forgive him, but ca&s;t him into pri&s;on. Then the king was wroth with him, and &s;aid unto him, O thou wicked &s;ervant. I forgave thee all that debt becau&s;e thou de&s;ired&s;t me: &s;hould&s;t not thou al&s;o have had compa&s;&s;ion on thy fellow|&s;ervant, even as I had pity on thee. And his lord delivered him to the tormenters, till he &s;hould pay all that was due unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31">
It is remarkable, that the promi&s;es, given to the &s;even Churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> are to them that over|come, See Rev. ii. and iiid chapters. In the iiid chapter and 5th ver&s;e it is &s;aid, He that over|cometh, the &s;ame &s;hall be clothed in white rai|ment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life. From which it appears po&s;&s;ible to have our names blotted out of the book of life; and if none but the elect have their names written therein, now even the elect may have their names blotted out of the book of life. We are farther warned in the xxiid chapter, ver&s;e 18, 19, that if any man &s;hall add unto the&s;e things. God &s;hall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book, and if any man &s;hall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God &s;hall take away his part out of the book of life.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;ays, "Thou ha&s;t thru&s;t &s;ore at this arm of God, that they might fall, by telling &s;ouls they might &s;tand to-day, and fall into hell to|morrow. Surely this mu&s;t weaken confidence in the omnipotence of God.&mdash;This proves thee a Preacher of damnation." It mu&s;t fir&s;t be proved, that tho&s;e who are ju&s;tified cannot commit &s;in: which Mr. <HI>H.</HI> will not undertake to do. For he &s;ays, the Scripture declare, that a ju&s;t man &s;inneth &s;even times a day. <HI>Solomon</HI> only &s;aith, Prov. xxiv. 16. A ju&s;t man falleth &s;even times, and ri&s;eth again; but the wicked &s;hall fall into mi&s;|chief." In this pa&s;&s;age we find neither the words <HI>day,</HI> nor <HI>&s;inneth.</HI></P>
<P>If a ju&s;tified per&s;on may fall into &s;in, then hear what St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, "He that committeth &s;in is of the devil," 1 John iii. 8. and in ver&s;e 15, "Who&s;oever hateth his brother is a murderer; and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him." The apo&s;tle doth not &s;ay, that &s;uch a one never had eternal life; but that he hath it not <HI>abiding</HI> in him.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant to whom the king forgave ten thou&s;and talents, is a proof of this truth, though the king has forgiven him that va&s;t debt, yet as
<PB N="26" REF="32">
he had ca&s;t his fellow-&s;ervant into pri&s;on for the finall &s;um of one hundred pence, the king ca&s;t him in al&s;o till he &s;hould pay all that he owed him, and &s;o likewi&s;e &s;aith our Saviour to his di&s;|ciples, "Shall my heavenly Father do al&s;o unto you, if ye from your heart forgive not every one his brother their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es," Matt. xviii. 25. Nor does this doctrine weaken confidence in the om|nipotence of God, for he can and will certainly &s;ave. and deliver all tho&s;e who continue to put their tru&s;t in him. But it weakens the vain con|fidence of our being the children of God while we are living in &s;in: "Verily, verily. I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever committeth &s;in, is the &s;ervant of &s;in." John viii. 34. And, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey. his &s;ervants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of &s;in unto death. or of obedience unto righteou&s;ne&s;s," Rom. vi. 16.</P>
<P>Nor is this preaching damnation, or encourag|ing unbelief; for he that affirms, that a per&s;on is &s;till a dear child of God, though he continue in &s;in, is a teacher of error, and lead per&s;ons into &s;uch a belief as will of con&s;equence un&s;ure their condemnation, if their works are according to &s;uch a faith; for God hateth all the workers of iniquity.</P>
<P>Page 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.&mdash;"Thou preache&s;t down the &s;ove|reignty of our Elect head, and Elect foundation Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by denying election; and thou preache&s;t down the everla&s;ting rightcou&s;ne&s;s of God. by denying its imputation, and thou preache&s;t down the omnipotence of God, by de|nying our per&s;everance therein, and then thou crie&s;t out, lo! here is Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>We neither preach down the &s;overeignty of Chri&s;t. nor his elect foundation, when we &s;ay, that all tho&s;e who are renewed and born again of his Spirit, and endure to the end, are they who are called the Elect of God, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is their Sovereign and Elect foundation, and as he foreknoweth who they are, they by him are

<P>Neither do we deny our per&s;everance in God's omnipotence, for we know that we cannot &s;tand one moment again&s;t our &s;piritual enemy, but by his omnipotent arm.

From the parable of the talents, we learn that the per&s;on there meant, called his &s;ervants, and gave to them the talents, therefore the talent which was improved by one of them, was not what he brought into the world with him; but it was not what his Lord gave him after he had called him. And as it was taken away from him for non-improvement thereof, and given to another; it was not then what he had by nature, but by grace, or it would not have been of any value to him who had ten talents already; it is plain that his talennts was the &s;ame as the others were, or his Lord would not have con|demned him for not improving it.</P>

<P>Repentance comes before a living faith, ari&s;ing from conviction of &s;in, and fear of eternal puni&s;h|ment, as in Acts ii. 37, 38. and xvi. 30, 31.

<P>Then the hope of the go&s;pel, according to this good Author, is, that Chri&s;t did not die for all men, although it declareth, " that he by the grace of God. &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man." And though many are in hell, yet Mr. <HI>H.</HI> cannot prove that Chri&s;t did not die for them, or that he &s;aid, there were none of the human race in hell for whom Chri&s;t died, or that he did not die for any that go to hell.

This argument is no proof of Chri&s;t's not dying for all mankind; but a &s;ubtle eva&s;ion ot the truth.

Therefore to &s;ay, the blood of Chri&s;t was not &s;hed for every man, is repre&s;enting it not of value &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e the whole of Adam's race, but only a few in com|parison of the. re&s;t, who are left to peri&s;h for want of &s;uch a ran&s;om. But who would give an in|finite price for a few, when the whole might have been equally purcha&s;ed thereby?</P>
<P>Does it not reflect on the wi&s;dom of Chri&s;t, to pay an infinite price for man's redemption? and on God to demand &s;uch a price, and but few of our race to be purcha&s;ed therewith? The Scrip|ture affirmeth that Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all; a propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world. See 1 Tim. ii. 1.&mdash;6; and John ii. 2. Therefore to &s;ay, his blood did not &s;low for all men, is &s;uch a di&s;honour to the Saviour's merits, and the word of truth; that one would think, that none would affirm it.

The author of the Skeleton I fear is one.

<P>How often would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not. And the&s;e mine enemies that would not that I &s;hould reign over them, bring them and &s;lay them before me. Our Lord does not once &s;ay, that he never &s;hed his blood for them that peri&s;h; nor is there any &s;uch pa&s;&s;age in the Bible. Nor does this reflect on his power, as
<PB N="40" REF="46">
if he could not hold them that are committed un|to him. For all power is given him both in heaven and earth, &s;o that whoever committeth his &s;oul into his hands, as into the hands of a faithful Creator and Redeemer, &s;hall be kept through faith unto &s;alvation, again&s;t &s;uch the gates of hell can|not prevail, while they continue faithful to the grace given them; for " the ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him."

<P>The hope of an Arminian is not fixed on a mutable Saviour, but on Him who is the rock of ages; nor doth he believe that God demands the &s;ame debt twice, fir&s;t of the &s;urety and then of the debtor; but believes, if, like the per&s;on to whom his Lord forgave ten thou&s;and talents, he &s;hould run again into wilful &s;ins, and not &s;hew mercy to his fellow-&s;ervants. Matt, xviii. Or beat the men &s;ervants, and the maidens, and eat and drink with the drunken, and became a worker of iniquity; that his Lord will ca&s;t him into pri&s;on, if not for the debt that was. forgiven, yet he will for the new debt, in &s;inning wilfully again&s;t his mercy and grace.</P>
<P>And as Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;ays in his 20th page, " God is not bound to keep them on in his &s;trength who reject his omnipotent arm." Then certainly he, may let them fall away, who thus reject him, and, lock them up in hell, until they can pay the ut|mo&s;t farthing.</P>
<P>However there may be &s;ome hardened to ad|vance lies in the name of the Lord, &amp;c. And &s;ay peace, peace, to tho&s;e who drink in iniquity like water, and encourage them to believe that they are children of God, though they live in actual &s;in. Yet what has this hope to do with the go&s;|pel. This is the go&s;pel-hope, " Every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf even as he is pure." 1 John iii. 3. Therefore he does not continue in &s;in ; for his hope is founded on the promi&s;es of God. See 2 Pet. i. 5. &mdash;10. and he al&s;o knoweth, that the promi&s;e is, " To them who by patient continuing in well-doing, &s;eek for glory and honour, and immortality; eternal life." Rom. ii. 7. Now if the promi&s;e is only to them who
<PB N="42" REF="48">
continue in well-doing, then tho&s;e per&s;ons mu&s;t be excluded, who do not continue therein.</P>
<P>Page 68. &mdash;" The&s;e univer&s;al lovers call the de|crees of God horrible." If they are only &s;uch per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s, who call God's de|crees horrible, why did not Mr.<HI>H.</HI> point them out? I believe that all God's decrees are like him&s;elf. both righteous, merciful and good.</P>
<P>Page 70. &mdash;" The Church of <HI>England</HI> tells me in her Catechi&s;m, that I am wholly unable to come to Chri&s;t. though he commands me. or to love God, though I am bidden, or to &s;erve him though it is for my life."</P>
<P>He has now taken up his Common-prayer book again, and tells us therefrom, that we can do no|thing of our&s;elves: but who among us denies this? We contend for it. and con&s;tantly declare, that without the grace of God we can do nothing ac|ceptable in his &s;ight; and this Mr.<HI>H.</HI> knoweth is what the Arminian holds, though he fal&s;ely ac|cu&s;eth them for holding the contrary.</P>

<P>We do not believe that Chri&s;t is &s;uch an au&s;tere Ma&s;ter, as to expect to reap where he has not &s;owed, and to gather where he has not &s;trawed. It will be time enough to think &s;o of him when we have found him &s;uch a one.

Univer&s;al Charity mu&s;t be much to blame, to teach Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to call Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, imputed non&s;en&s;e; if this be true, we can|not take his part. But to teach him to boa&s;t of perfection in him&s;elf, is the thing he hates, as he does the Church of <HI>England.</HI> As this Author &s;hews &s;ach di&s;like again&s;t the doctrine of Chri&s;|tian Perfection, I &s;hall here point out what we under&s;tand by it. It appears to me to mean no|thing more or le&s;s, than what the&s;e following Scriptures contain, Matt. v. 48. " Be ye there|fore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," Sec 1 Pet. i. 15, and Ezck. xxxvi. 25. &mdash;29: where it is &s;aid, " I will al&s;o &s;ave you from your uncleanne&s;&s;es." St.<HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, 1 The&s;&s;, v. 23, 24: " And the very God of peace &s;anctify you wholly: and I pray God your whole &s;pirit, and &s;oul, and body, be pre&s;erved blamele&s;s unto the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Faithful is he that calleth you, who al&s;o will do it." See St.<HI>John</HI> 1&s;t Epi&s;tle i. 7. to the end, and chap. v. ver. 18. If the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages do not mean a being clean&s;ed from all &s;in. by per|fecting holine&s;s in the fear of God, what can they mean? The holy men of old were called perfect, in their generations: as <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. vi. 9. and <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. xvii. 1. and <HI>Job</HI> i. 1. It then ap|pears, &s;ince life and immortality are brought to light by the go&s;pel, that there is a perfect de|liverance from &s;in promi&s;ed to the children of God; called in other words, perfect love; to love God with all our heart, and mind, &s;oul and &s;trength.</P>
<P>We know that all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;in; but God is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; then of cour&s;e, we mu&s;t be clean&s;ed from all &s;in, when God fulfilleth that promi&s;e.</P>
<P>This work of being clean&s;ed from all &s;in, is wrought in the &s;oul by the Holy Gho&s;t, without which no man could be holy, harmle&s;s, and un|defiled, without &s;pot, or blemi&s;h, as the Church
<PB N="44" REF="50">
of Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be, " A glorious Church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing; but that it &s;hould be holy, and without blemi&s;h." Eph. v. 27.</P>
<P>How ab&s;urd is it to &s;ay, that the blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth us from all &s;in, and that God is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; and yet that we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;in as long as we live.</P>
<P>Where is it written in the Scriptures, that we mu&s;t &s;in again&s;t God as long as we live? or that he will not deliver us therefrom until death &s;teps in, and helps him to put a finishing &s;troke to &s;in?</P>
<P>Is not contending for &s;in's continuance with us as long as we live, a reflection on the power, goodne&s;s, mercy, and truth of God? On his power: as if he could not finally deliver or &s;ave his people from their &s;ins, until death comes and helps his omnipotent arm to do the work? On his goodne&s;s; who always hateth &s;in, and is an|gry not only with the wicked, but with his own children al&s;o, for their &s;inning again&s;t him, and yet will not deliver them as long as they live? Does not this repre&s;ent God, as if he delighted in their &s;ins, though he has promi&s;ed to clean&s;e them from all their filthinc&s;s, and from all their idols, when neverthele&s;s, he will not do it? It reflects al&s;o on his mercy, to &s;ay that he never will de|liver his children from their &s;ins, until they at death can &s;in no longer: &s;o that, poor &s;ouls! they mu&s;t not only be bowed down by the remem|brance of their former &s;ins; but mu&s;t al&s;o feel the burden of them, intolerable as long as they live. Certainly this is not that great deliverance which God has promi&s;ed in his holy word. The apo&s;tle faith. " Rejoice in the Lord always, and again, I &s;ay rejoice." Phil. iv. 4: and in 1 The&s;&s;. v. 16, 17, and 18th ver&s;es, " Rejoice evermore, pray without cea&s;ing. in every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us concerning you." Surely we may not rejoice and give thanks, for our continuing in &s;in, as long as we live,
<PB N="45" REF="51">
when we by the renewing grace of God. de&s;ire &s;o much to be delivered therefrom. It al&s;o re|&s;lects on the truth of God, who has promi&s;ed to deliver us, and yet will not do it.</P>
<P>"He that is taught to deny election, is in|&s;tructed to deny the Church Catechi&s;in, which teaches, I believe in God the Holy Gho&s;t, who hath &s;anctified me, and all the elect people of God."

<P>"Though I have the gift of Arminian prophecy, as Mr. <HI>Bell</HI> had, and could tell when <HI>London</HI> would be de&s;troyed by an earthquake," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The word Arminian, is not in the chapter; and as to prophecy, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> was as much mi&s;taken as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was, when he &s;aid, the Lord told him, his wife was dead.</P>

<P>"Charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, &mdash;about improving a natural talent, being faithful to grace received."</P>
<P>Does Charity then vaunt it&s;elf about improving an unnatural talent? of its good works being "&s;ufficient to weigh down the works of fifty Ar|minian Trunk-makers?" or of being faithful to grace received? "Doth not behave it&s;elf un|&s;eemly," in crying down every Preacher's repu|tation,

<P>Page 75. &mdash;"Rejoices when eternal election is revealed to a poor &s;inner."&mdash;"Rejoiceth in the enjoyment of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s."

Rom. v. 2. and to "Rejoice in the Lord, and rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." Phil. iii. 1. 3. But we are not bidden to rejoice in eternal election, revealed to a &s;inner; nor in an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, neither of which expre&s;&s;ions are found in the Bible.</P>
<P>"Charity beareth all things, from fal&s;e Doctors, rather than give up one grain of God's truth to their fancy, believeth all things, never call God to an account about his decrees."</P>
<P>Charity is certainly a ble&s;&s;ed gift of God, and the bond of perfectne&s;s, and like its heavenly founder, hateth nothing that he hath made. It mu&s;t not then be expected that we &s;hall give up one grain of God's truth to the Doctor, who made the Skeleton; for God's truth teaches, that Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man, &amp;c. and that he wil|leth not that any &s;hould peri&s;h, &amp;c. Such truths as the&s;e we do not intend to give up, becau&s;e they are written in the word of God. Nor have we any need to call God to an account about his de|crees; for we believe them to be holy, ju&s;t, and good; therefore we &s;hould be quite inexcu&s;able to contradict, or oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>"Never arraigns God at the bar of carnal rea|&s;on." Carnal rea&s;on is but a fal&s;e guide, to di&s;|cern &s;piritual things by, and every man that hath received the grace of God, knows that nothing but the word of truth, and the revelation of Chri&s;t by his Spirit, can enable any one to know and under&s;tand divine things; as the apo&s;tle &s;aith, 1 Cor. ii. 14. "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are

<P>This Charity is contrary to the word and truth of God, that declareth, He is no re&s;pecter of per|&s;ons, and his tender mercies are over all his works. That God does ab&s;olutely elect &s;ome few out of mankind to be &s;aved, by irre&s;i&s;tible grace, and all others are pa&s;&s;ed by, and left to peri&s;h, without grace, &s;ufficient to bring them to Chri&s;t; how this doctrine will &s;tand at the bar of eternal ju&s;tice, we will not ab&s;olutely deter|mine. But &s;ure we are, that it is contrary to what the angel proclaimed to the &s;hepherds, Luke ii. 10, 11. "Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people, &amp;c." For it is impo&s;&s;ible that this doctrine can any ways be good tidings of great joy to tho&s;e whom God hath reprobated, and who can never come to the knowledge of the truth.</P>

<P>Whether the po&s;&s;ibility of finally falling away from grace be a helli&s;h principle or not, we &s;hall let God decide; but if we cry and pray to Him day and night, as Mr.<HI>H.</HI> &s;ays, all the elect do, then there will be but little cau&s;e to fear our finally falling away, if we thus continue faithful: &s;o that in this ca&s;e we are agreed.

<P>The children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were as confident, as Mr. <HI>H.</HI> is, of God's promi&s;es never failing them; yet they found by their &s;inning again&s;t him, that his promi&s;es did not &s;tand in &s;uch an ab&s;olute, un|conditional &s;en&s;e as they imagined; for they un|der&s;tood that the Lord would ab&s;olutely bring them into the land of promi&s;e, which he &s;ware to their fathers, and declared again unto <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> See Exod. iii. 7, 8, 16, and 17th ver&s;es; and ibid. vi. 6, 7, 8. The&s;e promi&s;es, to bring them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> into the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> are ab&s;olute; and &s;o they under&s;tood them; but when the Lord had delivered them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> he gave them &s;tatutes and judgments to ob&s;erve, and threatened not to forgive them, if they &s;inned again&s;t him. See Exod. xxiii. 20, 21. In the xxxiid chapter, ver&s;e 34. "Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have &s;poken unto thee: behold mine angel &s;hall go before thee." This the Lord &s;aid unto <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to &s;hew that he was not willing to de&s;troy his people. See xxxiiid chapter 1, 2, 3, and 14th ver&s;es. But in Numbers xiv. 11, 12. We find the promi&s;e rever&s;ed; for the Lord &s;ays, I will &s;mite them with the pe&s;tilence, and di&s;in|herit them. And &s;ays in 22d and 23d ver&s;es, "Surely they &s;hall not &s;ee the land which I &s;ware unto their fathers, neither &s;hall any of them that provoked me &s;ee it," of which &s;ee more in ver&s;e 27, to 35. in which the Lord confirms his threat|nings again&s;t the people, and &s;ays in ver&s;e 34, "And ye &s;hall know my breach of promi&s;e."</P>
<P>After this, in Numb. xxxii. 10, 11, 12. and Deut. i. 31.&mdash;37. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells the people quite a different thing from what he was commanded to &s;ay unto them in <HI>Egypt</HI>; there he told them of God's promi&s;es to deliver them, and bring them into the land of <HI>Canaan</HI>; but here he tells them of the Lord's oath to the contrary, and all the&s;e

things happened unto them, becau&s;e they wilfully &s;inned again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Nor does God break his promi&s;es herein, with reference to him&s;elf, though to them who receive his promi&s;es in an ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, it may appear as if he does: but God makes no promi&s;es to tho&s;e who break his commandments, which gives them a right to the benefits of the promi&s;es: for were God's promi&s;es to &s;tand, contrary to his command|ments. they would then be to each other quite in|con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>If we receive the promi&s;es of God in &s;uch wi&s;e as are contrary to his commands, we cannot but expect, if we continue in &s;in, that we &s;hall find his breach of promi&s;e, with re&s;pect to our appre|hen&s;ions of them; but not with re&s;pect to what God him&s;elf intended, who always intended, that his laws, &s;tatutes, precepts, and commandments, together with his mercies, promi&s;es, threatnings, and judgments, &s;hould coincide, and harmonize; &s;o that, whoever di&s;obeys the one part, mu&s;t needs lo&s;e the benefit of the other; for he that continueth to break God's laws and command|ments, under any pretence whatever, forfeits all right to his mercies and promi&s;es; however he may think or imagine to the contrary. See Rev. xxii. 14, 15. and Rom. ii. 6.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the unchangeable love of God, we may ob&s;erve, that <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, P&s;alm v. 5. "Thou hates all the workers of iniquity." We therefore &s;hould con&s;ider, whether of the two will prove that God is unchangeable, his con|tinuing to love the per&s;on for ever, whom he has once loved, although, that per&s;on becometh a worker of iniquity, or God's &s;tanding to this de|claration of the p&s;almi&s;t, of hating all the workers of iniquity. For fir&s;t, a per&s;on who turneth from the ways of God, and works iniquity, is taught to believe that God loves him with an unchangeable or everla&s;ting love, for was God to hate him, he would be a changeable God.</P>

In the next place, God mu&s;t change from the&s;e words, of hating all the workers of iniquity, or be counted a changeable God; judge ye then whether of the twain is true.

We therefore defy the Author of the Skeleton to prove, that none, be&s;ide, by making &s;hipwreck of faith and a good con&s;cience, ever drew back to perdition, as <HI>Judas</HI> did; or after &s;etting their hands to the plough, looked back, and made them&s;elves unfit for the kingdom of heaven; or who for&s;ook not the fountain of living water, and hewed out to them&s;elves broken ci&s;|terns, that could hold no water.</P>

<P>This is their method of repre&s;enting the ever ble&s;&s;ed God, as dealing thus with his creatures, and under pretence of &s;hewing his love to them, &s;ecretly decrees their eternal de&s;truction without ever giving them the lea&s;t power to e&s;capc it.</P>
<P>That the Arminians think God a changeable being, is fal&s;e, and what Mr. <HI>H.</HI> can never prove; but becau&s;e they &s;ay with the Scriptures, that God hateth all the workers of iniquity; though they might have once been in a &s;tate of grace, and that he who committeth &s;in is of the devil; as St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays; this being contrary to the Authors tenets, he with all the &s;ophi&s;try of a Je&s;uit would per&s;uade men that the Arminians make God to be a changeable being; when they always charge that change upon tho&s;e per&s;ons who turn from God unto &s;in; and not on God, who is the &s;ame ye&s;terday to-day and for ever, who always hateth &s;in, and all tho&s;e who continue therein, let their preten&s;ions to the contrary be what they will.</P>
<P>And as <HI>Jews, Arians,</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> think contrary to the word of God, and the te&s;timony of his Spirit, &s;o do tho&s;e, who think that Chri&s;t did not die for all; and they, in that, and &s;everal other points, think as freely as any others.

<P>The Author here gives an account of a poor woman, "who had never heard the go&s;pel," (as he &s;ays,) She "was &s;orely wounded in &s;pirit, and carried her grievous complaints to a blind Prie&s;t, when &s;he returned, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a well, but was got out without much hurt. Soon after &s;he went to another blind guide of the &s;ame family, and then went home and cut her throat. I went to the hou&s;e, and told her mo&s;t of the trouble of her heart.

However the woman was Tent to St. <HI>Luke's,</HI> and Mr.<HI>H.</HI> went to &s;ee her, but could not get admit|tance, what coun&s;el or advice he intended to give her we know not: but, as he "believes all the clect &s;hall be taught of God, and all the re&s;t &s;hall be ever learning, but never be able to come to the knowledge of the truth," his advice &s;hould have been to the following purpo&s;e, You mu&s;t know there are two &s;orts of people upon earth, the Elect, and the Reprobates, the Elect have got a gracious Saviour who died for them, and will lave them by irre&s;i&s;tible grace, he having &s;hed his precious blood for them, to that end, and they &s;hall all be certainly &s;aved, for God has &s;o decreed. But the Reprobates he hath pa&s;&s;ed by and will not &s;ave them, for he never &s;hed his blood for them, therefore they mu&s;t peri&s;h do what they can or will.</P>
<P>If you are one of the Elect your name is written in heaven, and as none can know to the contrary, then you have no cau&s;e to fear, for all things &s;hall work for your good both in time and in eternity; for the Saviour is gracious to all his Elect, and thty &s;hall never peri&s;h. for he loveth them with an everla&s;ting love.

But as I would not leave you comfortle&s;s, I advi&s;e you to believe in, and pray to the Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for mercy and pardon, and if you are one of the Elect he will hear, and &s;ave you; for he has delivered thou&s;ands, that were &s;eemingly in as bad a con|dition as you are, and who knows, but perad|venture, he may have mercy on you, and deliver you: but if not, you are never the farther off, your prayers can do you no hurt in point of &s;al|vation, if they do you no good.</P>

<P>Penetration here gives an account of the pri|&s;oner's pedigree, and repre&s;ents him as building of <HI>Jericho,</HI> and learning to build with untempered mortar at <HI>Babylon,</HI> and &s;ome were fond of him for his cheap way of building, and called him Charity, and as he built with any materials, they call|ed him Univer&s;al.

<P>Here is no compul&s;ion, as Mr. <HI>H.</HI> talked of before.</P>
<P>Page 125. &mdash;Here he goes on to tell, how he ob|tained his petition, and a Kid given him to make merry with his friends, and to feed it be&s;ide the Shepherd's tents, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Page 126. &mdash;"As &s;oon as the gracious Lord had left me, there came a man by me, with his hair oiled and parted on the crown, with words &s;moother than oil. I &s;hewed him the Kid I had received, and enquired for the Shepherd's tents to feed it at. He told me of one Shepherd; &s;o I followed him, when the old Shepherd appeared, I &s;hewed him my Kid, I told him I was come to water and feed it at his tent."</P>
<P>This witne&s;s then gives an account of his &s;eeing the river of life glide by as clear as cry&s;tal, and this Shepherd, he lays, "Sent one of his &s;ervants to the river to fetch water, and he jumped into the river and fouled the water with his feet, and then gave it to the Kid, thick and muddy as it
<PB N="64" REF="70">
was, and be trampled upon the green pa&s;ture, before he gave the Kid any. I a&s;ked if my Lord's keys were committed to his care, if he had the key of the Larder, and Wine-cellar? He an|&s;wered yes, and of every thing el&s;e; I a&s;ked him to give me a little wine that was &s;trong; not new, but old."</P>
<P>Page 128. &mdash;"He went to the Cellar, but he had lo&s;t the key of knowledge, &s;o he could not go in, he brought me a little drop of mixture, and gave it me, but not &s;ufficient to make me forget my poverty, nor my mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>This witne&s;s &s;eemingly wanted to get drunk; for when people are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, they often forget their poverty and mi&s;ery al&s;o. However he goes on with more of his whims, and a&s;ks for food, &s;uch as the Scripture calls good, but he had nothing but hu&s;ks; <HI>very fit for &s;wine,</HI> and all his food mu&s;t be paid for, either in ca&s;h or labour, that is, perform certain conditions, nothing to be had without money, or price.</P>
<P>Page 129. &mdash;"So I took my leave of him, ex|periencing a &s;evere hungering and thir&s;ting after rightcou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>It is a wonder, that it was not called imputed rightcou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Judge. "You are &s;ure you &s;aw him foul the water, and mix or adulterate the wine? Yes my Lord, and my Lord and King told me it was mixed: and I am too good a judge of that &s;ort of Liquor to be deceived."</P>
<P>What a blunder, here the pri&s;oner is charged with fouling the water, when it was the Shep|herd's &s;ervant that fouled it.</P>
<P>Judge. "Tell Mr. Prede&s;tination to &s;tand forth, and give in his evidence again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar."</P>
<P>Judge. "Mr. Piede&s;tination, do you know the pri&s;oner?"</P>
<P>Prede&s;tination. "Yes my Lord, my ance&s;tors were people that belonged to the Seas, they were natives of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> a land not far from <HI>Me&s;opota|mia</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="71">
the fir&s;t trading voyage they made was from the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> to the City of <HI>De&s;truction,</HI> in the land of <HI>Shinar</HI>; but they met with a con|trary wind, and were ca&s;t away not far from the <HI>Fair-havens,</HI> many of the family on board were irrecoverably lo&s;t."</P>
<P>As this witne&s;&s;es account takes up near nine|teen pages in his Book, we &s;hall give in his words what we think needful, and the re&s;t in other words occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>This witne&s;s then &s;peaks of his trying to &s;wim, and e&s;pying a mountain, called the Ancient Mountain, and thought he &s;aw a Rock over-hang it, and private &s;tairs to a&s;cend it: and having got one foot on the fir&s;t, he looked about him, and &s;aw &s;ome hundreds of his family &s;tanding with Univer&s;al Charity, the pri&s;oner at the bar, who beckoned to him. He then &s;aw on the top of the mountain a beautiful man with a cord in his hand let down to him; he took hold of the cord, and had not got above three &s;teps up the &s;tairs, when Univer&s;al Charity got hold of his &s;kirts, &s;o fa&s;t that he could not &s;hake him off. He was forced to drag him up near to the top of this lofty hill; but when within three or four &s;teps of the top, he cried, Lord &s;ave, or I peri&s;h, then Uni|ver&s;al Charity let go his &s;kirts. He then gives account of various other vi&s;ionary fancies, about wi&s;dom, &amp;c. and of being intoxicated with wine, that he forgot, father, mother, wife, children, &amp;c. He then brings in Under &s;tanding, who &s;hews to him another hill, and &s;he &s;ays to him,</P>
<P>Page 137. &mdash;"This on which we &s;tand is eternal election, or ab&s;olute prede&s;tination: called by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> an Ancient Mountain, becau&s;e it was ca&s;t up and e&s;tabli&s;hed from everla&s;ting, and that high hill, with its &s;hining top, is Glorification, which he calls a la&s;ting hill, becau&s;e it endures for ever. And the fea&s;t which thou ha&s;t been entertained with, he calls the chief things of the Ancient Mountains, and is an earne&s;t of the precious things of the la&s;ting hills."

<P><PB N="66" REF="72">
This Author does almo&s;t every where fill his Reader's head, with the vain fancies, of his &s;elf|conceited brain, and &s;undry fal&s;e repre&s;entation of things. He here tells us that <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as quoted above, called eternal election, or ab&s;olute pre|de&s;tination, an ancient mountain, and glorification a la&s;ting hill; which is fal&s;e; for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has no &s;uch word as eternal election, or glorification in all the chapter. The words are, ver&s;es 13. &mdash;16. And of <HI>jo&s;eph</HI> he &s;aid, "Ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath. And for the precious &s;ruits brought forth by the &s;un, and for the precious things, put forth by the moon. And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the la&s;ting hills, and for the precious things of the earth, &amp;c." <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaks here of the temporal ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>jo&s;eph</HI>'s race, and not of eternal ble&s;&s;ings in &s;piritual things. She then &s;peaks to him of the Dei&s;ts, and Athei&s;ts, and &s;ays,</P>
<P>Page 141. &mdash;"The&s;e &s;hall ere long, pray for the rocks to fall upon them, and to the hills to cover then: the&s;e have their hour under the power of darkne&s;s; they deny the Lord that bought us."</P>
<P>This word <HI>us</HI> is another fal&s;e repre&s;entation, contrary to the Scripture, which &s;aith, "Even denying the Lord that bought <HI>them,</HI>" 2 Pet. ii. 1.</P>
<P>The Arians are &s;poken of next. "They are tho&s;e who trample on the atoning blood of Chri&s;t; and by exclaiming again&s;t the Lord's divinity, they render it in effectual to heal them; for the efficacy of the human blood ari&s;es from its union with the God-head; &s;o they making him a crea|ture only exclude them&s;elves from redemption."</P>
<P>This is quite amazing, for Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to allow, that the Arians, by denying, and exclaiming again&s;t the divinity of Chri&s;t, &s;hould <HI>render it ineffectual to heal them;</HI> if &s;o, it is not becau&s;e his blood was not &s;hed for them. But they, by denying his God-head, exclude them&s;elves from his redemp|tion. If it be they them&s;elves, that do all this by
<PB N="67" REF="73">
their own faults, then they could not be excluded by an eternal decree; but in con&s;equence of their own fault. Here the Author for once lets the truth &s;lip from him unawares, and acknowledges with the Arminians, that men may make the effi|cacy of the blood of Chri&s;t ine&s;&s;ectual, with re|&s;pect to them, and exclude them&s;elves from his redemption.</P>
<P>Page 142. &mdash;"She led me through a gate, called imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s." P&s;alm cxviii. 19.</P>
<P>Note, this is fal&s;ely quoted; for imputed righ|teou&s;ne&s;s is not in the P&s;alm.</P>
<P>Page 145. &mdash;"Let your light &s;hine before men, be faithful in the covenant, and thou &s;hall be ruler over many things."</P>
<P>Here he contradicts him&s;elf, by allowing, we &s;hould be faithful in the covenant, and yet con|temns, being faithful to grace received, except the covenant, and grace, are oppo&s;ite to each other.</P>
<P>" Do you not &s;ee a company of men at the foot of the mount, &s;ome dwell in little booths, others in holes in the earth, and &s;ome &s;tand at the mouth of the caves with bows in their hands? They are archers. There are various troops of them, but each carries a bow: the Antinomian levels his arrows at the experience of the heart; the Ar|minian levels at the judgment; others at the re|putation, of tho&s;e who a&s;cend the mount. I mu&s;t now take my leave."</P>
<P>It is a wonder Under&s;tanding did not tell him who he levelled his arrows at; for &s;he might have &s;aid, you level your bow and &s;hoot your arrows at others, with re&s;pect to their experience in their hearts; and at their judgments as fal&s;e and a their reputation al&s;o; as may be &s;een in the Skeleton.</P>
<P>After this, poor Prede&s;tination came down from the mountain, and went with a woman, in the attire of an harlot, into a booth, where they &s;tripped, wounded, and robbed him, and took away his vail from him. And we may &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="74">
left him half dead; for one of them drew a bow at a venture, and wounded him in the head, and then ca&s;t him into a pit, out of which he got at la&s;t, and &s;aid, "Thus I was robbed, and almo&s;t killed."</P>
<P>It does not appear that Univer&s;al Charity was among this bad company: for this witne&s;s does not mention any thing of him, after he had got rid of him, when he was got almo&s;t to the top of the mountain.</P>
<P>Page 149. &mdash;"The Judge then makes his &s;peech to the Jury, and &s;peaks of the &s;ecret decrees of the Mo&s;t High, and of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ays.

<P>It is &s;omething wonderful how the&s;e &s;ecret de|crees came to be known; for if they are &s;ecret who can know them? But a writer of Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s &s;tamp &s;ays, that nothing can come to pa&s;s, but what the Sovereign Jehovah has determined &s;hall come to pa&s;s, then of cour&s;e, there is none that can act contrary to his &s;ecret decrees; but mu&s;t do his will, be it good or bad; for he that com|mits murder, adultery, or any other crime, if he acts by an irre&s;i&s;tible decree of God, does his will in &s;uch a ca&s;e, as much as he doth that feeds the hungry, or clothes the naked. Therefore, is it right for God to &s;end &s;uch faithful &s;ervants to eternal damnation, who thus do his will, by acting according to his decrees? In the Judge's &s;peech, Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as having a natural affection as a man, when he wept over <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> but as God he will be quite the rever&s;e, &s;o that his actions as a man are repre&s;ented as contradictory to him&s;elf as God, but as he came to do, in his manhood, the whole will of God, then it was God's will that he &s;hould weep over <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>On an Arre&s;t of Judgment by an appeal; and a rule of Court granted for a fre&s;h trial of Univer&s;al Charity, in which trial he is honourably acquitted.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. Univer&s;al Charity, being had back ac|cording to his &s;entence to the place from whence he came, to the gaol, of Mr. Election, and put under his care and cu&s;tody, to be kept &s;afe until the day of his execution; he there began to think how unfairly and unju&s;tly the trial had been carried on again&s;t him, and how he had not been permitted to &s;peak in his own defence, nor any friend allowed to &s;peak in his behalf. Though he was con&s;cious in him&s;elf that he had ju&s;tly de|&s;erved puni&s;hment with re&s;pect to his manifold offences in the &s;ight of God; and that his natural di&s;po&s;ition, as well as that of all men, was evil and that continually, until renewed by the grace of his King, and that he had done many evil things, that de&s;erved death, and was a child of wrath even as others, and while he continued in this &s;tate, he might properly be called Love|Self, for then he loved none but tho&s;e who were like him&s;elf, companions in iniquity; yet as he had now received mercy of the Lord by being re|newed, and born again of his Spirit, and had re|ceived of him a pardon, for his manifold offences, and had been reconciled unto him, through faith in his blood, and &s;anctified by his Spirit; and led
<PB N="70" REF="76">
thereby to love all men for his &s;ake, even his ene|mies, and the enemies of God as his own &s;oul, and praying with &s;ervent de&s;nes that all men might come to the knowledge of the truth and be &s;aved. It was from this love, that he had for all men, which he received of his heavenly Father, for he had no &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition in him before by nature, but quite the rever&s;e, that made his enemies, and his pro&s;ecutor, call him Univer&s;al Charity. His pro&s;ecutor was quite of another &s;pirit and temper retaining &s;till the old leaven of malice and partial love, which we have by nature, and from hence it was that he determined to pro&s;ecute him unto death, as wicked <HI>Cain</HI> did his righteous brother. When Mr. Election had received him again into his care, he a&s;ked him, what was the rea&s;on of his being &s;ent back to him again? For all tho&s;e who are under the condemnation of the Law of the King of Kings, are kept in the cu&s;tody of Mr. Reprobation until they are delivered by a free pardon out of his hands, or executed according to the law. If &s;uch per&s;ons repent of their manifold &s;ins, and are pardoned through faith in the blood, of Chri&s;t our King, they are then delivered into my hands, not as pri&s;oners, but as the Lord's free|men; I therefore &s;hould be glad to know, if you are one of them or not?</P>
<P>Mr. Univer&s;al Charity replied, The late Court, at which I was tried; condemned me for crimes laid to my charge, &s;uch as I knew not, and for holding opinions contrary to the notions of my pro&s;ecutor, Mr. Uncharitable: but to clear my character I &s;hould be much obliged to you, to per|mit &s;ome of my friends to vi&s;it me, as I &s;hall be glad of their good company, to coun&s;el me in what I have to impart to them, and to receive &s;ome &s;piritual con&s;olation from them, and com|munion with them; for I want &s;uch as fear and love God to vi&s;it me, if I can obtain this reque&s;t!</P>
<P>Mr. Election &s;aid, I am glad you de&s;ire &s;uch per|&s;ons to come to you, and was I to refu&s;e your request,
<PB N="71" REF="77">
I &s;hould be wor&s;e than a Heathen, who permitted <HI>Paul</HI>'s friends to come and &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Mr. Univer&s;al Charity thanked him for his kindne&s;s and &s;aid, The fir&s;t per&s;on I would have &s;ent for is Mr. Love-Truth; I hope you have no objection to him?</P>
<P>Mr. Election &s;aid, he is one of my intimate friends, and one whom I highly e&s;teem. I will therefore &s;end my &s;ervant for him immediately, which he did, and he came as &s;oon as &s;ent for, and was directly introduced to the pri&s;oner, who acquainted him with what the Court had done, and &s;aid he thought the proceedings again&s;t him were not right.</P>
<P>Mr. Love-Truth &s;aid, I think &s;o too, and if you plea&s;e I will acquaint Mr. Divine Rea&s;on, a Coun|&s;ellor of great note and experience, with your ca&s;e, and lay a copy of your trial before him, and doubt not but that he will take your affair into con&s;ideration, and get a Rule of Court granted for a fre&s;h Trial, by which you may not only be di&s;|charged from the condemnation lately pa&s;&s;ed on you; but may al&s;o be declared to be one of the Lord's freemen.</P>
<P>Mr. Univer&s;al Charity, &s;aid, I am very much obliged to you for this kind and brotherly offer, and &s;hould be glad for you to do as you have pro|po&s;ed. Mr. Love-Truth, then took his leave, and went to Mr. Divine Rea&s;on's hou&s;e and laid the affair before him. Who &s;aid, I know the whole affair, for I was in the Court all the time of the trial; but was not permitted to &s;peak, becau&s;e not retained as a Coun&s;ellor in the affair. But I know there was a great deal of undue in|fluence made u&s;e of by Mr. Uncharitable through|out the whole proceedings. I have already made the ca&s;e known to my Lord Divine Expe|rience, who &s;aid, if the pri&s;oner applied to him he would u&s;e his influence to obtain a Rule of Court for a fre&s;h trial, in which ca&s;e he thinks with me, that Mr. Univer&s;al Charity will be acquitted; therefore call on me to-morrow morning and I
<PB N="72" REF="78">
will go with you, and &s;peak to Mr. Univer&s;al Charity, on his ca&s;e. Mr. Love-Truth called the next morning accordingly, and they went both of them together. As &s;oon as they came to Mr. Election's hou&s;e, he led them into his parlour, and brought the pri&s;oner to them, and in his hearing, Mr. Divine Rea&s;on a&s;ked Univer&s;al Charity, various que&s;tions concerning his Trial, and the many things laid to his charge by his pro|&s;ecutor, and the witne&s;&s;es, and what his opinions and practices were, and what doctrines he taught, "as he was an old Eccle&s;ia&s;tic?" To which he gave very &s;atisfactory an&s;wers, and &s;aid, he could bring per&s;ons of good repute and &s;piritual di&s;|po&s;ions to clear his character from any &s;lagrant acts of inju&s;tice or wickedne&s;s; and &s;poke of the &s;everal Chri&s;tian experiences he had received of the Lord by his holy Spirit; &s;uch as his con|victions of &s;in; and his being held for &s;ome con|&s;iderable time in &s;piritual bondage through un|belief; how he was at la&s;t delivered therefrom by the grace of God, through faith in Chri&s;t, who gave to him the knowledge of &s;alvation by the re|mi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins, and revealed him&s;elf to him with power in his heart; and &s;aid, I &s;hall never forget that ble&s;&s;ed day in which the Lord was plea&s;ed to reveal him&s;elf to me, nor the &s;weetne&s;s of that intercour&s;e between the Lord and me, &s;uch as pa&s;&s;es all under&s;tanding, which occa&s;ioned a joy un&s;peakable and full of glory: and many other &s;weet and precious vi&s;its have I received of the Lord &s;ince that time, &s;uch as no man knows, but him that receiveth them.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on &s;aid, I am very glad to hear &s;uch an account as this from you, and &s;hall ac|quaint my Lord Divine Experience with your affair, and you may depend on my doing you all the &s;ervice I can con&s;i&s;tent with my duty. Mr. Univer&s;al Charity then thanked him for his kindne&s;s. Mr. Election then &s;aid, I am glad to hear this account of the Trial, and Mr. Uni|ver&s;al Charity's experience, it gives me a great
<PB N="73" REF="79">
deal of plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction: and I am fully per&s;uaded that he is of the truth and of the elect of God, and though he differeth from me in &s;ome things, yet I believe him to be a child of God; for his experiences &s;hews him to be &s;uch, which makes me think the proceedings again&s;t him hitherto have been very wrong and unju&s;t; but I hope it will not be long before he will be ac|quitted of the charge laid again&s;t him, of which I &s;hall be very glad, and be always willing to have his good company; for I account him one of my Brethren in the faith of the Go&s;pel. They then joined in prayer together for a ble&s;&s;ing on them&s;elves, and their pre&s;ent undertaking, not forgetting all tho&s;e who are of the hou&s;ehold of faith of every denomination: and then Mr. Di|vine Rea&s;on, and Love-Truth, returned home.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on then went into his Study, and wrote out in fair characters, the whole of Mr. Univer&s;al Charity's account of him&s;elf, and all other nece&s;&s;ary remarks on his ca&s;e, and then waited On my Lord Divine Experience, and laid the whole affair before him, who &s;aid, It will be proper to prefer an Appeal, by a writ of error, in an Arre&s;t of Judgment, in order to obtain a fre&s;h Trial, in which I make no doubt, but Mr. Univer&s;al Charity will be acquitted. We will to-morrow wait on my Lord Spiritual-Man, who, no doubt will go with us to my Lord Di&s;cerning-|of-Spirits, and there appoint a day to examine the Appeal, in order to obtain a Rule of Court for a fre&s;h Trial, which if denied, we mu&s;t appeal to the King of Kings.</P>
<P>The next day they waited on the Lord Spiritual|Man, who &s;oon agreed to go with them to my Lord Di&s;cerning-of-Spirits, where after &s;ome di&s;|pute, they concluded to call a Court on the affair, which was accordingly done. And after much debate on the bu&s;ine&s;s, it was agreed on, to bring the matter to a final i&s;&s;ue by another Trial, of Univerval Charity; which is as follows.</P>

<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ion being given to my Lord Di&s;|cerning-of-Spirits: the Court opened, the former Jury impannelled, and the former wit|ne&s;&s;es there ready to give in their evidences as before: the Judge then took his &s;eat in order to try the pri&s;oner again, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by my Lord Divine-|Experience, and my Lord Spiritual-Man. Mr. Univer&s;al Charity was then brought forth to his Trial, and the Jury as before were &s;worn; the pri&s;oner was then commanded to hold up his hand, and his former indictment was read. There was at that time in the Court, a certain Orator, who informed the Judge again&s;t the pri&s;oner, and &s;aid, We have found this man a pe&s;tilent fellow, and a mover of &s;edition, a teacher of hereby, and a ring-leader of the &s;ect of the Nazarenes.

<P>Mr. Penetration. He learned to build with mortar that was not good: for he taught that Chri&s;t died for all men, and that if a per&s;on were once in grace, he might fall from it; he al&s;o ex|ploded faith without good works, as dead and devili&s;h; he al&s;o contended again&s;t the word Im|puted Rightcou&s;ne&s;s as not right, becau&s;e it can|not be found in the Bible; he taught that no man could know God's &s;ecret decrees, and that we mu&s;t improve the grace given to us or fall &s;hort of glory, and that we mu&s;t be clothed with a re|newed righteou&s;ne&s;s in the heart, as well as have the merits of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us, and to be made holy and clean&s;ed from all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s; this was his untempered mortar, and the materials he built with.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on, Did he not declare, that all &s;piritual things mu&s;t be done and wrought in us, by the operation of the Holy Gho&s;t, through faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, who is the only foundation of a &s;inners hope, and who worketh in us both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Mr. Penetration. I have heard him &s;ay &s;o; but as he did not &s;peak of the&s;e things, in the &s;ame manner as &s;ome others have done, I did not re|gard him.</P>
<P>Judge. Call Mr. Wi&s;e-Ma&s;ter-Builder. He then, gave in his evidence as before.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on. You talk of a foundation on which you built, and &s;ay it was on a rock; but you have not told us what rock you mean. If your rock was any other than Chri&s;t Je&s;us, it could not be a right foundation, and as Mr. Uni|ver&s;al Charity always contends, that there is no
<PB N="76" REF="82">
other foundation for a &s;inner's hope, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if he then &s;aid that all other foundations were wrong he &s;poke the truth; and if he either in the dark or light pecked away all other foun|dations he was to be commended. As for his thru&s;ting in clay, as you &s;ay he did, I &s;uppo&s;e you mean, that your foundation being on ab&s;olute election, and different from his, that he &s;trove to remove your building thereon, and endeavoured to make you build only on Chri&s;t, "For other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t," 1 Cor. iii. 11. Nor may we allow of any other; for this foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure, and this alone. See Eph. ii. co.</P>
<P>The Queen was called next, and gave in her evidence as before.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on then a&s;ked her, after you had told Mr. Univer&s;al Charity concerning your dignity and grandeur, and the love of your King to you, did not the pri&s;oner &s;ay, that the King might ca&s;t you off, if you were unfaithful to him, and went and played the harlot with many lovers, and committed &s;piritual adultery, again&s;t him? that in &s;uch a ca&s;e he would ca&s;t you off, as he had done others, witne&s;s the &s;even Churches in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the Churches of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> which were once his delight and his &s;pou&s;e, but now are cut off? Did he not forewarn you in the words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. xi. 20, 21, 22. "Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God &s;pared not the natural branches"(the Jews) "take heed le&s;t he &s;pare not thee. Behold therefore the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of God; on them that fell &s;everity; but towards thee goodne&s;s, if thou continue in his goodne&s;s; otherwi&s;e thou al&s;o &s;halt be cut off?"</P>
<P>Queen. This I cannot deny; but I am taught to believe, that the King will never ca&s;t me off: he may vi&s;it me with &s;tripes, and &s;courges; but his loving kindne&s;s he will never take from me, nor cau&s;e his faithfulne&s;s to fail.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83">
Mr. Divine Rea&s;on, My Lord, you hear that if this Queen be guilty of many great and grievous offences again&s;t her King, yet &s;he is taught that he will only vi&s;it her offences with &s;tripes, and her iniquities with a &s;courge, but will never take away his loving kindne&s;s from her; whereas this promi&s;e is given to <HI>David,</HI> and his &s;eed, that if his children for&s;ook the Law of God, and walked not in his judgments, &amp;c. the Lord would then vi&s;it their iniquities, but his loving kindne&s;s he would not take from <HI>David,</HI> nor &s;uffer his faithfulne&s;s to fail; but would fulfil his promi&s;e, that the Me&s;|&s;iah &s;hould come of his loins and be King over the hou&s;e of I&s;rael for ever.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the pri&s;oner did warn the Queen on wrong grounds, it does not appear any other than an hone&s;t mi&s;take; what harm could there be in his advice? we are exhorted to be faithful unto death, and tho&s;e per&s;ons who improved the talents, were called good and faithful &s;ervants; but this Queen makes it out, as if the pri&s;oner &s;aid, the King would for&s;ake her without cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Freeman was then called, and gave in his evidence as before.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on. Did not the pri&s;oner tell you, that if you left off to watch and pray, and begin to beat the men &s;ervants and the maidens, and to eat and drink and be drunken, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e your Lord would cut you a&s;under.</P>
<P>Mr. Freeman. This I cannot deny; but as I cannot keep my&s;elf, I expect that the King him|&s;elf &s;hould be faithful by keeping me from tho&s;e things, or if he permit me to fall thus from him, that he will neverthele&s;s &s;till pardon me, though I &s;hould thus &s;in again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on. Then you believe in this ca&s;e contrary to his word, of cutting you a&s;under and appointing you a portion with the unbe|lievers.</P>
<P>Mr. Adoption was then called and gave in his evidence as before.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="84">
Mr. Divine Rea&s;on. This Shepherd the wit|ne&s;s, met by his de&s;cription of him, was a Naza|rite, a glorious name; but in telling us of giving the Kid drink, &amp;c. he repre&s;ents the &s;ervant of this Shepherd, as jumping in and fouling the water before he gave it to the Kid, and trampling down the gra&s;s before he let the Kid eat, which was to be &s;ure very wrong; but why &s;hould this act of his be brought in again&s;t the pri&s;oner? If this witne&s;s did not like the good wine of the Kingdom that was given him, he might go el&s;e|where, and as he &s;ays, he was too good a judge of that liquor, to be deceived, then I pre&s;ume he has frequently ro&s;e up early in the morning to drink &s;trong drink, and continued until night, till wine inflamed him, on &s;uch is pronounced a woe, See I&s;a. v. 11. But &s;uppo&s;e the pri&s;oner to have com|mitted a fault in this ca&s;e, yet to have him boiled and made a Skeleton of, about a Kid, and a little wine, is quite out of character, and &s;hews what a revengeful &s;pirit his pro&s;ecutor is of.</P>
<P>Mr. Prede&s;tination was then called, and gave a very long account about many vi&s;ionary whims and fancies.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on ob&s;erved, that what he charged Mr. Univer&s;al Charity with, was his wanting to get up to the top of the mountain with him; but as he did not like any &s;hould get up but him&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e (&s;aid he) that he pu&s;hed the poor man down again; but be that as it will, he was forced to let go his hold, and fell almo&s;t from the top to the bottom, and he might have broke his neck for what this witne&s;s cared, &s;o that he, the pri&s;oner, had the greate&s;t cau&s;e to complain. This witne&s;s farther &s;ays, that Under&s;tanding told him, the hill he was upon was called Eternal Election: but there is no &s;uch hill as this men|tioned in the Bible: therefore this cannot be a right place to build a good foundation upon. I &s;hall but ju&s;t mention one thing more, when this witne&s;s came down from this mountain he talks of, he met with an harlot and went along with
<PB N="79" REF="85">
her; the more &s;hame for him, and &s;he led him into a booth, where he was robbed, wounded, and almo&s;t killed, which I do not wonder at, when he got into &s;uch bad company, but it does not appear, that the pri&s;oner was among this wicked company. Yet it is laid at his door. The Court then called &s;ome few per&s;ons of good re|pute, in vindication of the pri&s;oner's character; the fir&s;t was, Mr. Love-Truth, who &s;aid, My Lord, I have known this man of a long time, and can &s;ay, that I have heard him many times declare the great love which the King of Kings hath to all his creatures, e&s;pecially to fallen men. I have often heard him declare how much it grieved him to &s;ee how many unhappy per&s;ons there are, who wilfully reje&s;t the coun&s;el of God again&s;t their own &s;ouls, and he has often exhorted them to flee from the wrath to come, and to lay hold on eter|nal life, through faith in Chri&s;t. He has often told them of the willingne&s;s of God to &s;ave them, and would not that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but rather that they &s;hould be converted and live. He has told them that Chri&s;t died to &s;ave them, and gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, and coun&s;elled them to ta&s;te and &s;ee how good and gracious the Lord is.</P>
<P>Judge. And did he al&s;o live agreeable to the &s;ame?</P>
<P>Mr. Love-Truth. Yes, my Lord, and as a proof thereof, he always declared, that who&s;oever did not live the life of faith in humble obedience to the word and will of God, they were none of his, let their preten&s;ions be what they will; for he &s;aith with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God," and, "If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t he is none of his." "If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die; but if ye through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body ye &s;hall live." The&s;e and &s;uch like ob&s;ervations he con&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed home upon his hearers, and on tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;ed, which your Lord&s;hip may find to be true from
<PB N="80" REF="86">
&s;everal others, who were eye and ear-witne&s;&s;es of his life and conver&s;ation, as well as me.</P>
<P>Mr. Free-Grace was then called, who &s;aid, My Lord, I have had long acquaintance with the pri&s;oner at the bar, who before he was acquainted with me, went by the name of Love-Self, and he has often acknowledged, that it was his proper name, and very de&s;criptive of his natural di&s;po|&s;ition; but as it had plea&s;ed God to reveal his Son in him, he &s;aid, he could not but admire, and ble&s;s the unmerited love and goodne&s;s of God in his free grace given unto him, who was totally unworthy thereof on any pretence whatever, and as he had found it written in the Bible, "I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord God." Ezek. xviii. 32. And as Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man, and gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all: he therefore thought, that the free grace of God given unto him, was not de|nied to others, and as God commanded that we &s;hould pray for all men, he therefore thought that he ought to love all men, and from thence he did con&s;tantly affirm that all men ought to love one another, e&s;pecially as our Lord had given commandment, to love not only one ano|ther, but our enemies al&s;o; for which rea&s;on he is called Univer&s;al Charity, or an Univer&s;al lover. It is true that he differs in his judgment in &s;everal things, from &s;ome other good men, who confine the free grace of God to &s;uch only as they call the Elect: but he believes it is not only free for the Elect, but al&s;o, for every Son and Daughter of <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Follow-Peace, was next called, and &s;aid, My Lord, I have been long acquainted with the pri&s;oner, and have ob&s;erved, that he has been often, grieved, that all the children and &s;ervants of God did not &s;trive more to follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord; and has &s;aid, he would have all Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who had received any degree of divine experience, to &s;hew forth
<PB N="81" REF="87">
good will to all men, and not to be &s;o bitter in defending their own opinions, and condemning others. And with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who walk contrary to the will of God, he &s;aid, that all tho&s;e who knew the Lord, &s;hould act in a friendly manner towards them, by kind and friendly re|proofs, tempered with &s;harpne&s;s, mixed with love to their per&s;ons; but with the utmo&s;t di&s;appro|bation and di&s;like of their &s;inful lives and vain conver&s;ation, ab&s;taining at the &s;ame time from all appearance of evil, and not have any fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s; but rather reprove them. Many more &s;uch kind exhor|tations, and pre&s;&s;ing arguments would he make u&s;e of, both in public, and private, and en|deavoured to follow the &s;ame him&s;elf, at all times and in all places, &s;aying, we ought to do all things to the glory of God.</P>
<P>Mr. Godly-Unity was then called, who &s;aid, My Lord, I have known the pri&s;oner a long time. He has propo&s;ed many times, to tho&s;e who were of a different opinion in religious matters, to Unity one with another, and to let controver&s;y drop; e&s;pecially &s;uch as engendered &s;trife and contention between tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who had received the evidence of things not &s;een; and &s;aid it was a great pity that &s;uch &s;hould fall into hot and angry di&s;putes about &s;uch things, as were une&s;&s;ential, who had far greater things to mind, &s;uch as the obtaining of a fuller manife&s;tation of the love of God; and brighter evidences of their growth in grace, which are often ob&s;tructed, by contentious and ob&s;tinate di&s;putes: he al&s;o would have all experienced Chri&s;tians to join in love to each other, for though they might not di&s;cern all things in the &s;ame light, yet they might agree in love and Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, and good-will to each other, and unite together to the pulling down of &s;in, and the &s;trong holds of Satan, and build each other up in love and good works, and through the grace of God, turn from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.
<PB N="82" REF="88">
For though, &s;ays he, &s;ome of my Brethren differ from me in opinions, and think my judgment wrong in various points as I do theirs, yet they agree with me that Chri&s;t is the only foundation of a &s;inner's hope, and that none can be &s;aved, but by the grace and power of God alone: that Chri&s;t is all in all to every one that believeth, and that without the power of his Holy Spirit we can do nothing. So that our &s;alvation is wholly of God's free-grace in Chri&s;t from fir&s;t to la&s;t. And though &s;ome of them believe it im|po&s;&s;ible for a per&s;on once in grace, to fall finally away and peri&s;h, yet they al&s;o allow, that &s;uch &s;hould glorify God in their lives and conver|&s;ations, which if they do not, they will doubt if they were ever in a &s;tate of grace; for, &s;ay they, the love of God &s;hed abroad in their hearts, would con&s;train them to live the life of the Go&s;pel. So that, &s;aid he, they agree with me, that men mu&s;t fir&s;t be holy, before they can be happy, and that they mu&s;t be led by the Spirit of God, or they could be none of his. Thus my Lord, I have told you how willing he is to unite with the chil|dren of God of every denomination, being willing to become all things, con&s;i&s;tent with the word of God, to all men, if that by any means he may be an in&s;trument in the hands of God of &s;aving &s;ome, and of building others up in their mo&s;t holy faith.</P>
<P>Mr. Fervent-Zeal was next called, who &s;aid, My Lord, with re&s;pect to the pri&s;oner, I have heard him &s;ay, and maintain that we all fell in <HI>Adam,</HI> and that it is impo&s;&s;ible any of us &s;hould recover our&s;elves from this fall, and that without Chri&s;t, we can do nothing acceptable unto God. With St. <HI>John</HI> he &s;aith, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world; and with St. <HI>Paul.</HI> That Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all; and, "As by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tifi|cation
<PB N="83" REF="89">
of life." Rom. v. 18. And &s;aid with <HI>David,</HI> The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works, and with <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> That God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. In &s;hort, he always declared, That we &s;hould give all dili|gence to make our calling and election &s;ure; and to fear le&s;t a promi&s;e being left us of entering into his re&s;t, we &s;hould fall &s;hort of it; declaring how the Lord cut off the children of I&s;rael in the wil|derne&s;s, and how <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> told them from the Lord, That they &s;hould know his breach of promi&s;e; and many other &s;uch exhortations he gave to caution us not to fall away through unbelief; for he that endureth to the end he &s;aid, &s;hould be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on then &s;aid, My Lord, I &s;hall call but one per&s;on more in behalf of the pri&s;oner, and that is,</P>
<P>Mr. Election, who &s;aid, My Lord, ever &s;ince Mr. Univer&s;al Charity has been committed to my charge, he has behaved him&s;elf as one of the elect of God, by walking in all his commandments, and renouncing all &s;elf-dependance, and &s;elf-righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, declaring that we have no righteou&s;|ne&s;s that will &s;tand us in any &s;tead, but the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: nor have we any real righ|teou&s;ne&s;s in our&s;elves, but what is given to us, and wrought in us by the operation ot God's holy Spirit; and as he contendeth for the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e truths, &s;o did his life, conver&s;ation and his experience, te&s;tify the &s;ame thing, of which he has given me a very clear account &s;uch as his conviction of &s;in, and being held for &s;ome time in &s;piritual bondage through unbelief, and how God was plea&s;ed to deliver him, by the pardon of his &s;ins, and by his Spirit bearing witne&s;s with his Spirit that he was a child of God.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other things he hath declared to me to be his experience, which has often filled him with wonder, love, and prai&s;e: &s;o that I think, he ought not to be condemned, &s;ince the Lord by his holy Spirit hath &s;et him free from
<PB N="84" REF="90">
the law of &s;in and death; for there is no con|demation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h but after the &s;pirit. He frequently &s;aid, that we ought to love all men, and al&s;o pray for them. This he proved from Matt. v. 43, 44. and 1 Tim. ii. 1. And that we mu&s;t love all the children and &s;ervants of God, who are renewed in his image, with a love of complacency, or delight; although they may differ from us in many things, relating to the great my&s;|teries of godline&s;s. And as for all others, we ought to love them with a love of benevolence, or good will, while living here on earth; but when they are departed hence, we mu&s;t leave them to God, and know of a certainty, that he will &s;end none to everla&s;ting de&s;truction, except they ju&s;tly de&s;erve it; for the judge of all the earth will do right. Thus, my Lord, I have given you a true and ju&s;t account of the pri&s;oner's character, which in duty and ju&s;tice I am bound to give.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on then &s;aid, My Lord, as we have heard all the per&s;ons I intend to call in be|half of the pri&s;oner at the bar, I beg leave to make a few remarks.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve, that God is love, and all his rational, or intelligent creatures ought to be &s;o likewi&s;e. It is the want of this, that make &s;o much &s;pite, malice, and ill-will in the world as we daily &s;ee: but were the whole world filled with Univer&s;al Charity, or Love, it would in a great mea&s;ure be what it ought, and what we wi&s;h it to be; free from contentious &s;trife. If Uni|ver&s;al Charity had but had a full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all men's hearts in former days, we &s;hould not have heard of &s;o much blood&s;hed, de&s;truction, and ruin, as we have heard of in the world. Had Univer&s;al Charity led the van, we &s;hould not have heard of the bloody per&s;ecutions of &s;o many thou&s;ands of poor innocent children and per&s;ons put to death by cruel and bloody ty|rants. If the love which our Lord and Saviour
<PB N="85" REF="91">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles, and di&s;cinles preached in the world, had met with no other enemy than Univer&s;al Charity, I am per&s;uaded there would not have been &s;uch bloody per&s;e|cutions carried on again&s;t them as there were under the Roman Emperors. Nor would the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> have per&s;ecuted the Prote&s;tants in &s;uch a mercile&s;s manner, if Univer&s;al Charity had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hearts. If they had been Univer&s;al lovers, they would not have been engaged in &s;uch inhuman work: nor &s;hould we have ever heard of the bloody butchery acted in the Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Paris,</HI> nor the infamous Ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in 1641. In &s;hort, had Univer&s;al Charity reigned in the hearts of all men, the numberle&s;s villainies of all kinds would never have been acted. But when the knowledge of the Lord &s;hall cover the earth, as the waters do the &s;ea; when each one &s;hall &s;it contented under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree, none making him afraid, then Univer&s;al Charity will be God's Vicegerent, and dwell in the hearts of all mankind, and God him&s;elf will reign in the hearts of all men without a rival.</P>
<P>And I am &s;ure that the Go&s;pel is good tidings of great joy to <HI>all</HI> people, and teaches to follow peace with <HI>all</HI> men, and to owe no man any thing, but to love one another, and were we univer&s;ally to do this as the Go&s;pel teaches, there would be no robberies, nor murders committed; no cheating nor defrauding one another. And as we are commanded to love our enemies, it would be quite irrational not to love our neighbours and friends, and therefore of nece&s;&s;ity we mu&s;t love all men, or break the commandments of God. Much more I might add in behalf of Univer&s;al Charity, or Univer&s;al love to all men; but I for|bear to trouble the Court any farther.</P>
<P>The Judge then addre&s;&s;ed his &s;peech to the Jury, &s;aying,</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the witne&s;&s;es have &s;aid again&s;t the pri&s;oner, in

which you may remember that they have brought nothing to the purpo&s;e of conviction, no ab&s;olute charge, or proof again&s;t him, but what is rather in a way of allu&s;ion to things that are rather fanciful than real, and &s;uch as are &s;poken in general terms; &s;o that I need not fum up their evidence, e&s;pecially as you heard the &s;ame on the former trial: and I &s;uppo&s;e you have made &s;uch remarks among your&s;elves, as are &s;ufficient to direct you in your con&s;ultation on the Verdict you are to give on the ca&s;e. Likewi&s;e you are to con&s;ider what the other per&s;ons have &s;aid in the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ners behalf, as they have &s;poken in a plain and fair manner with re&s;pect to his judgment and opinions, as well as his character, you may ea&s;ily recollect the &s;ub&s;tance of what they have &s;aid, without my repeating it. I &s;hall therefore di&s;mi&s;s you with the&s;e in&s;tructions. If you are con|vinced, that the pri&s;oner is an enemy to God, his word, and people, by wilfully breaking his holy laws, by wicked works, and under the pre|tence of love to God, and to all men, he has, or does act the hypocrite, by drawing near to God with his mouth while his heart is far from him; or if you are per&s;uaded that he endeavours to op|po&s;e God's goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, mercy and truth; you are in the&s;e ca&s;es to bring him in guilty. But if you are convinced that he is of God, by loving and obeying his holy will, and that from a mind renewed by the grace of God, he lives to the prai&s;e and the glory of his grace, as far as you are able to know from what has been &s;aid; you are then to bring him in not guilty, although he may in &s;ome things differ in his opinions, from &s;ome good men. I therefore would have you bring in your Verdict as &s;oon as you can, and we will &s;tay till you return; and may the Lord direct you!</P>

<P>1. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, Were I to bring the pri&s;oner in guilty, I mu&s;t then condemn my&s;elf; for with me
<PB N="87" REF="93">
he declareth, that Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, and ta&s;ted death for every man, and that we &s;hould pray for all men, 1 Tim. ii. 1.-6. and Heb. ii. 9. and of con&s;equence we ought to love all tho&s;e we pray for, as the pri&s;oner &s;aith.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, I agree with <HI>Paul</HI> in my judgment, that Chri&s;t is the propitiation, not for our &s;ins only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world, 1 John ii. 2. And as God is love, &s;o he that loveth is born of God, 1 John iv. 7, 8. and as the pri|&s;oner confirms the&s;e doctrines, both by precept and example, I can but acquit him.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Jude</HI> &s;aid, I al&s;o agree with you both, and declare with re&s;pect to the common &s;alvation, that he who contends for the faith once delivered unto Saints, is a child of God, let others call him what they will; on this ground then I mu&s;t ac|quit the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;aid, I acquie&s;ce with you, my holy Brethren. And as the Angel &s;aid to the Shep|herds, behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which &s;hall be to all people, Luke ii. 10. And as the pri&s;oner confirms this truth, as tidings of great joy to all men, let us relea&s;e him.</P>
<P>5. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;aid, I approve of what each of you have &s;aid; for God promi&s;ed to our father <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> that in his &s;eed &s;hould all the nations of the earth bo ble&s;&s;ed, Gen. xv.ii. 18. and xxii. 18. For thus &s;aith the Lord, Look unto me and be ye &s;aved all the ends of the earth; and &s;aith, I will al&s;o give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou maye&s;t be my &s;alvation unto the ends of the earth, I&s;a. xlv. 22. and xlix. 6. I then acquit the pri|&s;oner, becau&s;e he holds the&s;e truths.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Mark</HI> &s;aid, I al&s;o agree with what each of you have &s;aid, and add in the words of our Lord; Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf, and furely the pri&s;oner does not contradict this, as he contendeth that we &s;hould love <HI>all men</HI> as our|&s;elves; &s;o let him go free.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Job</HI> &s;aid, I agree with each of you, and a&s;k, Why &s;hould we pro&s;ecute him? Behold the fear
<PB N="88" REF="94">
of the Lord that is wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil is under&s;tanding, which we hear is the di&s;|po&s;ition, and practice of the pri&s;oner. And was I to e&s;teem him an Hypocrite, I &s;hould act as wrong by him, as my friends did by me, by being a mi&s;erable comforter to him, in&s;tead of defending his innocency, by acquitting of him.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> &s;aid, I not only agree with you, my well-beloved brethren, concerning Chri&s;t the Me&s;&s;iah dying for &s;inners, and that we &s;hould love all men for his &s;ake: but I al&s;o ob&s;erve, that the pri&s;oner cautions the children of God again&s;t falling away from him, like as I have declared from the Lord, "My people have committed two evils; they have for&s;aken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns, that can hold no water." Jer. ii. 13. and complains, "Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right &s;eed, how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a &s;trange vine unto me?" Jer. ii. 21. This the Lord a&s;ks concerning them that turned from him, therefore I mu&s;t not condemn the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Matthew</HI> &s;aid, Nor I neither; for he defends what my gracious Ma&s;ter taught, who came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them; for he &s;aith, what the pri&s;oner contends for, is in my fifth chapter, from ver&s;e 43, to the end, which I need not repeat; "Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall break one of the&s;e lea&s;t commandments, and &s;hall teach men &s;o, he &s;hall be called the lea&s;t in the king|dom of heaven: but who&s;oever &s;hall do and teach them, the &s;ame &s;hall he called great in the king|dom of heaven." Matt. v. 19. "Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets." Chap. vii. ver. 2. And as it is declared that the pri&s;oner doth teach and do them, I therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>10. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid, I agree with you all; a man that preaches mu&s;t &s;peak as the oracles of God, and this I find the pri&s;oner doth, by affirming with
<PB N="89" REF="95">
Brother <HI>Paul</HI> and me, that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. Nor does he bring in damnable here&s;ies, by teaching men to deny the Lord that bought them; but teaches that Chri&s;t is, "not willing, that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance," 2 Pet. iii. 9. And warns men, not to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them, 2 Pet. ii. 20. 21. Therefore let him go free.</P>
<P>11. <HI>David</HI> &s;aid, You have all &s;poken agreeable to the Laws of the Cele&s;tial Realm; and as the pri&s;oner doth &s;et forth the goodne&s;s and loving kindne&s;s of the Lord, by affirming that the Lord is good to all. and that his tender mercies are over all his works, P&s;alm exlv. 9. which is quite agreeable to what I have learned of the Lord. I do therefore give my con&s;ent, for his relea&s;e.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid, I am for his being acquitted from the charge brought again&s;t him; for with me he affirmeth, that in the &s;eed of my father <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;hould all nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed, as God had promi&s;ed; and he likewi&s;e gives warning to all not to for&s;ake the Lord God, as tho&s;e did in my time, whom I al&s;o warned again&s;t falling away from the Lord; but who neverthe|le&s;s provoked the Lord in the wilderne&s;s, and for&s;ook him; in&s;omuch that the Lord &s;ware in his wrath, they &s;hould not enter into his re&s;t; and commanded me to tell them that they &s;hould know his breach of promi&s;e, and that they &s;hould bear their iniquities forty years, and die in the wilderne&s;s; and the Lord was angry even with me for their &s;ake.</P>
<P>The Jury then being all agreed, came into the Court, and the Judge &s;aid, Gentlemen of the Jury, what &s;ay you, is the pri&s;oner Guilty or not Guilty? To whom <HI>Paul</HI> their foreman made an|&s;wer, Not Guilty my Lord.</P>
<P>The Judge then &s;aid, Mr. Univer&s;al Charity, you are now honourably acquitted; and then gave or|ders that he &s;hould be di&s;charged by public pro|clamation, which was done accordingly. At which
<PB N="90" REF="96">
many in the Court rejoiced. The pri&s;oner then returned his mo&s;t grateful, and thankful acknow|ledgment to the Court, for their candid and im|partial enquiry into his affair. And then the Court broke up.</P>

<HEAD>PART the THIRD. <HI>The Trial of Mr. Uncharitable, alias Partial Charity.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<P>AFTER Mr. Univer&s;al Charity was di&s;charged, many of his friends per&s;uaded him to pro|ceed in a pro&s;ecution again&s;t Mr. Uncharitable, who had unju&s;tly pro&s;ecuted him, which he was unwilling to do; for &s;aid he, it may be deemed returning evil for evil, and that will not be doing right. But one Mr. Godly-Zeal, an enemy to &s;in of every kind, &s;aid, that he had a full Commi&s;&s;ion from the King of Kings to oppo&s;e &s;in in all its forms, and &s;aid, as I am in duty bound &s;o to do, I am therefore determined that the Law &s;hall be put in force again&s;t Mr. Uncharitable, or Partial Charity, becau&s;e he is a wicked Spirit, endued with a very &s;inful nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Godly-Zeal then went with &s;ome of his friends, who were great oppo&s;ers of &s;in, to Mr. Go&s;pel-Experience, the Magi&s;trate, and having given him an account of various and great evils, that Mr. Partial Charity had done, and was con|tinuing to do by the help of the Devil, again&s;t the Laws of the King of Kings, his crown and dig|nity, with an intent to de&s;troy all his faithful children, &s;ervants, and &s;ubjects, and to ruin his kingdom here on earth, which he had &s;et up at &s;o great an expence, and which he had purcha&s;ed with his mo&s;t precious blood.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="97">
The Magi&s;trate having heard the crimes which the&s;e hone&s;t men had charged Mr. Uncharitable with, he, upon their oaths, granted a warrant to apprehend him. They then carried the warrant to Mr. Godly-Re&s;olution, the Con&s;table, one that was firm in his purpo&s;es, and &s;teady in his tru&s;t, and al&s;o a great enemy to &s;in. In a little time after, having heard where Mr. Uncharitable was, he called &s;ome of his faithful neighbours to go along with him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in taking Uncharitable into cu&s;tody, which they did, though with &s;ome difficulty, and put him into the Cage, till they could carry him before the Magi&s;trate, of which they gave notice to Mr. Godly-Zeal, and his friends who attended with the pri&s;oner before Mr. Go&s;pel-Experience; with whom was Mr. Godly-|Mind, another Ju&s;tice of the Peace, before whom, the pri&s;oner was examined; and being fully charged with committing many wicked practi&s;es of long &s;tanding, and al&s;o of later date, his Mit|timus was made, when he was &s;ent to Gaol, and delivered into the Cu&s;tody of Mr. New-Man, a very faithful and diligent per&s;on; and Mr. Godly-|Zeal was bound over to pro&s;ecute him. There was bail offered for him, but refu&s;ed; becau&s;e all manner of &s;in is unbailable, by rea&s;on of its un|governable di&s;po&s;ition, and the Law &s;ays, we mu&s;t keep under, and bring into &s;ubjection, or cap|tivity, the whole body of &s;in; &s;ee Rom. vi. 6. 2 Cor. xx. 5. and Gal. v. 24. of which Partial Charity is one of its chief branches, as will be proved on the trial. As &s;oon as Mr. New-Man had him in cu&s;tody, he found that he had a &s;ubtle, wicked, and ungovernable pri&s;oner to deal with, and therefore was obliged to watch him with all diligent care, and circum&s;pection; or he would, one way or other, have got out of pri&s;on, to the great damage of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and to the hurt and di&s;grace of Mr. New-Man and his friends.</P>
<P>The time being come for the Trial of Mr. Un|charitable, the Commi&s;&s;ion was given to my Lord
<PB N="92" REF="98">
Divine-Experience to try him, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by my Lord Spiritual-Man, and my Lord Di&s;cerning-of-Spirits. The Grand Jury were holy men of God. who&s;e real characters and writings are contained in the Old and New Te&s;tament, who&s;e names were, 1. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> 2. <HI>Job,</HI> 3. <HI>David,</HI> 4. <HI>Solomon,</HI> 5. <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> 6. <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> 7. <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> 8. <HI>Matthew,</HI> 9. <HI>Mark.</HI> 10. <HI>Luke,</HI> 11. <HI>John,</HI> and 12. <HI>Paul,</HI> who found the bill again&s;t the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The Court then proceeded to try him. having fir&s;t appointed or impannelled the Gentlemen of the Jury, who were men of approved characters, who&s;e names were, 1. <HI>Enoch,</HI> 2. <HI>Noah.</HI> 3. <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> 4. <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> 5. <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> 6. <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> 7. <HI>Samuel,</HI> 8. <HI>Elijah.</HI> 9. <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> 10. <HI>Daniel,</HI> 11. <HI>Peter,</HI> 12. <HI>Jude.</HI> The&s;e being &s;worn, took their places, when the pri&s;oner was brought to the bar, and there holding up his hand, the Indictment was read as follows.</P>
<P>Mr. Uncharitable, alias Partial Charity, you are here indicted by the name of Uncharitable, or Partial Charity, of the Town of Fal&s;e-Love, in the County of Little-Good. For di&s;turbing the peace of the children and &s;ervant of the King of Kings, the Sovereign Lord of the Univer&s;e; by having rebelled again&s;t his Laws. robbed and plundered his faithful Subjects. and put to death very many of them in a cruel and barbarous man|ner: and by the help of the devil, ha&s;t put our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour to death. Nor has there been any manner of evil committed upon earth, but thou ha&s;t had &s;ome hand in it, and ha&s;t always been in &s;ecret or open practices of rebellion with thy wicked con&s;ederates, in all manner of unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s, inju&s;tice, and wickedne&s;s, again&s;t our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his crown and dignity. What &s;aye&s;t thou? Art thou Guilty, or not Guilty?</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner an&s;wered, Not Guilty, my Lord; and &s;o put him&s;elf upon his defence. The wit|ne&s;&s;es were then called. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was Mr. Tell-Truth, who being &s;worn, the Judge a&s;ked him what he had to &s;ay in behalf of oar Sove|reign
<PB N="93" REF="99">
Lord the King, again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar?</P>
<P>Tell-Truth. My Lord, the pri&s;oner, Mr. Un|charitable, ju&s;tly an&s;wers his name; his wicked nature quite agreeing thereto. The fir&s;t two bro|thers ever born into the world, he &s;et one again&s;t the other, and at la&s;t in&s;tigated the elder to kill the younger, becau&s;e his own works were evil and his brother's righteous. He al&s;o helped to fill the earth with violence, &s;o that God brought the flood on the world of the ungodly; but by means of an ark, <HI>Noah,</HI> and his family, being eight per|&s;ons, were &s;aved from the flood, while all the re&s;t were drowned; and pity it was, this pri&s;oner did not peri&s;h with the wicked: but &s;ome way or other he e&s;caped, and made his appearance with <HI>Nimrod,</HI> the mighty hunter; he after that got into the cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> &amp;c. for which, and other wickedne&s;&s;es, the Lord over|threw tho&s;e cities with fire from heaven. He af|terwards got into the family of a very good man, named <HI>Jacob,</HI> and by the help of one of his wicked companions, named <HI>Envy,</HI> he &s;tirred up ten of this man's &s;ons to &s;ell their Brother <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> into <HI>Egypt,</HI> for a bond-&s;lave. In proce&s;s of time, this pri&s;oner &s;tirred up <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to deal very un|charitably with the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who were cho&s;en people of God; who commanded them to kill their male children as &s;oon as they were born, and laid very heavy burdens on tho&s;e people of God; oppre&s;&s;ing them with cruel bondage. But God plagued that wicked King with ten terrible plagues, and brought his people out from among them, and delivered them from their enemies by bringing them &s;afely through the Red-Sea on dry ground; and drowned, and overthrew all the ho&s;t of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> both him&s;elf, his cha|riots, and his hor&s;e-men, who pur&s;ued the children of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>The pri&s;oner al&s;o &s;tirred up the Kings of <HI>Canaan,</HI> &amp;c. (who were many in number) to war again&s;t the&s;e people of God; but the Lord was with them,
<PB N="94" REF="100">
and de&s;troyed their enemies, and gave them their lands for an inheritance. The pri&s;oner al&s;o moved <HI>Ahab,</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>Jezebel</HI> his wife, to take away the life and vineyard of <HI>Nabeth</HI> the Jeze|reelite, and to de&s;troy all the Prophets of the Lord; he having filled his wicked King and Queen with &s;o much partial Love, that they had but very little Charity for any but the Prie&s;ts of their Idol <HI>Baal.</HI> And indeed, my Lord, I had like to have forgotten that this Partial Charity &s;o prevailed with <HI>David,</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> a man after God's own heart, as to cau&s;e him to commit adultery with <HI>Uriah</HI>'s wife, who afterwards cau&s;ed her hu&s;band to be killed by the enemy, by commanding his General to leave <HI>Uriah</HI> un&s;upported in the fore-|front of the hotte&s;t battle, where he was &s;lain in defence of that King, who, in this unju&s;t manner, procured him to be &s;lain. He al&s;o filled <HI>Saul,</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with his uncharitable &s;pirit, in&s;omuch that he gave commandment for the Prie&s;ts of the Lord to be &s;lain. And when our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was upon the earth, he filled the Chief Prie&s;ts, and Rulers of the Jews, with &s;uch uncharitable|ne&s;s, that they put to death the Lord of life and glory, and afterwards per&s;ecuted his apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples. He al&s;o filled <HI>Saul,</HI> (afterwards called <HI>Paul,</HI>) with &s;o much partial Charity, that he breathed out threatnings and &s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord, haling forth men and women to pri&s;on, and per&s;uaded <HI>Saul</HI> that he ought to do many things again&s;t the name of Je&s;us. The pri&s;oner al&s;o &s;tirred up enemies again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> after he was converted, and in the end got him put to death. He al&s;o &s;et on foot ten bloody per|&s;ecutions again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, under the Roman Emperors: and when that Empire became Chri&s;|tians, he in proce&s;s of time, turned this Church of Chri&s;t into a Church of per&s;ecution, &s;o that thou|&s;ands of the children and &s;ervants of God were put to death in the mo&s;t cruel manner, throughout divers countries and kingdoms, for many ages; many of them were burnt alive, others were driven
<PB N="95" REF="101">
out from their homes in the depth of winter, to peri&s;h on ice and &s;now, being de&s;titute, afflicted, and tormented; many were tortured with the mo&s;t cruel and bloody barbarities, that were po&s;|&s;ible for human beings to contrive. Likewi&s;e to this pri&s;oner may ju&s;tly be charged, the bloody ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Paris,</HI> and the cruelties exerci&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the Prote&s;tants; and al&s;o the <HI>lri&s;h</HI> ma&s;&s;acre, in which many thou&s;ands wcre butchered in a very inhuman manner; the&s;e and many other cruelties too tedious to mention, hath this wicked being, Mr. Uncharitable, been guilty of.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Charity was then called, and being &s;worn, &s;aid, My Lord, I have known the pri&s;oner a long time, and could not only witne&s;s what has been &s;aid again&s;t him already, but can give a far|ther account of him, though not to his credit. His father is Lucifer, the great enemy of God and man, called Satan the deceiver, or prince of hell; called likewi&s;e the Devil and Apollyon the de|&s;troyer; and his Mother's name is Sin. The&s;e two have got a numerous progeny that are all wicked to the la&s;t degree like their parents; and they are &s;o linked together, that there is not any evil com|mitted upon the whole earth, but what &s;ome of the&s;e, the Devil's offspring have a principal hand in doing it: of which offspring, the pri&s;oner is one of the principal, in&s;omuch that there is no manner of &s;in committed but what he has &s;ome hand in carrying it on, and is often the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ail|ant, and like his father the Devil, and his mother Sin, he is partial in every thing he does. For my Lord, he not only helped to act tho&s;e bloody &s;cenes before &s;poken of, by Mr. Tell-Truth; but has cau&s;ed many unju&s;t and bloody wars to be &s;et on foot, and by his wicked coun&s;el, and the help of his confederates, his Brethren and Si&s;ters, &s;uch as envy, &s;pite, malice, hatred, revenge, murder, cruelty. &amp;c. with all manner of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and inju&s;tice, whereby he has &s;o prevailed, that whole countries and kingdoms have been ruined by their means, and many cities, towns, and vil|lages
<PB N="96" REF="102">
have been depopulated and de&s;troyed by them; and the inhabitants put to death by famine, fire, and &s;word: and likewi&s;e all manner of mur|ders, robberies, extortion and oppre&s;&s;ions have been carried on by him and his confederates. But to be more particular, I &s;hall mention a few in|&s;tances of his unrighteous dealings, and that of late date, that the Court may know he is &s;till the &s;ame evil being as formerly.</P>
<P>In the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he &s;tirred up the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to invade her territories, de&s;troy her kingdoms, and put her &s;ubjects to death in a barbarous manner; they having brought with them, in their invincible Armada, as they called it. a great number of cruel in&s;truments of death, which may be &s;een in the Tower of <HI>London</HI> to this day; from which barbarous intention of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Lord was plea&s;ed in mercy to de|liver us. He al&s;o moved Count <HI>Tully</HI> to de&s;troy the City of <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> who flew the whole in|habitants thereof with the &s;word. not &s;paring even the women and children, of which that Count often gloried afterward. The dreadful fire of <HI>London,</HI> and the late riots there, may be ju&s;tly charged to the pri&s;oner, be&s;ide many other things of the like nature. He has al&s;o cau&s;ed many di|vi&s;ions between the mo&s;t intimate friends, and often has &s;et per&s;ons at variance, who have com|menced vexatious law-fuits again&s;t each other for mere tri&s;les. And to make his wickedne&s;s the more complete, he has &s;et the children of God at variance, one again&s;t another, under various pre|tences. For when, through divine grace, I have been in&s;trumental in bringing per&s;ons of different opinions in religion to embrace the truth, and &s;ome of them have received the evidence of things not &s;een, and a manife&s;tation of the love of God &s;hed abroad in their hearts, and have united to|gether in Chri&s;tian love and fellow&s;hip; after awhile this Mr. Partial Charity, would &s;tep into their hearts, and influence either party, and &s;ome|times both, to withdraw their love from each
<PB N="97" REF="103">
other, under a pretence of one holding the truth in preference to the other; and then he per&s;uades them that they ought earne&s;tly to contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints, and under this pretence, he has &s;et them to oppo&s;e each other, and has thus de&s;troyed their love and good-will towards each other, till at la&s;t he obtains his ends, &s;o as to make them think uncharitably one of another, and has &s;eparated them &s;o, that &s;ome of them &s;carcely allow, that any will be &s;aved but tho&s;e of their own party. And the bigots of &s;uch party-di&s;pute, under the influence of the pri&s;oner, will contend, that their opponents never had Chri&s;tian experience, let their experiences be what they will; but will repre&s;ent it as fal&s;e, and a delu&s;ion, although their experiences agree with their own. becau&s;e they &s;ee things in a different point of view. But were tho&s;e per&s;ons whom they &s;o uncharitably judge, to alter their opinions, and join in tho&s;e of their opponents, they would then be looked upon by them as real Chri&s;tians, although they have had no farther experience of a work, of grace than they had before: &s;o that &s;uch pcr&s;ons Judge according to their opinions, and not according to the experience another may have of a work of grace on his heart. And when at any time the moderate men of each party, would compromi&s;e the differences between them, in order to unite together in love and chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip. and contend only again&s;t &s;in and Satan, and all their adherents, then this pri&s;oner, with his wicked confederates, join together to oppo&s;e it with all their might; fearing le&s;t their father's kingdom fhould come to nought: and therefore the pri&s;oner &s;tirs up one fiery party|&s;pirited bigot, or other to oppo&s;e &s;uch an union, either by fal&s;e reports, or mi&s;repre&s;entations of tho&s;e per&s;ons who differ from his opinions; of which, my Lord, we have a recent in&s;tance in the Author of the Skeleton, who invited the pri&s;oner to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in compiling that Unchri&s;tian book. If &s;o, &s;aid the Judge, he ought to be tried with the

<P>My Lord Spiritual-Man, then a&s;ked the Judge if he had read it? Yes, &s;aid he. and I think it ought to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, for the &s;pirit of it: and then made &s;ome remarks on the Author's calling religious people, Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites, and Nazarites, and repre|&s;enting &s;uch, to be wor&s;e than thieves, murderers, &s;odomites, &amp;c. becau&s;e they differ from his opini|ons, and laying to their charge, the wrong and fal&s;e opinions of others, contrary to their writings, and repeated tc&s;timony; which, &s;aid the Judge, is both unju&s;t and uncharitable, and &s;uch as ought not to be countenanced by any per&s;ons, e&s;pecially not by experienced Chn&s;tians of any denomi|nation.</P>
<P>He then a&s;ked the witne&s;s, if he had any thing more to &s;ay?</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Charity. Yes, my Lord, this wicked pri&s;oner, at the Council of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> &s;o prevailed by his bad influence that the Council condemned <HI>John Hu&s;s</HI> and <HI>Jerome</HI> of <HI>Prague,</HI> to be burnt alive for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r holding the truth, which was done accordingly. At the Synod of <HI>Dort</HI> he procured &s;everal Mini&s;ters to be bani&s;hed, becau&s;e they could not in their con&s;ciences agree with what the Synod was plea&s;ed to decree in all things. And the &s;ame &s;ort of work he promoted here in <HI>England,</HI> in the reign of Queen Mary, by per&s;e|cution, and in part the &s;ame, in the reign of King <HI>Charles,</HI> when many eminent Mini&s;ters were turned out of the Church, and &s;ome of them were &s;ent to pri&s;on for preaching the word of God; thus has this pri&s;oner dealt with good men.</P>
<P>Mr. Godly-Zeal, was next called and &s;worn. The Judge then a&s;ked him, what he had to &s;ay again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar?</P>
<P>Mr. Godly-Zeal. My Lord, when any per&s;ons have been in&s;pired with godly zeal, for the honour of God, this pri&s;oner bath endeavoured
<PB N="99" REF="107">
to turn it into an intemperate and uncharitable zeal, and has very often &s;ucceeded in his attempts.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of <HI>Jehu</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who &s;hewed forth his zeal in the de&s;truction of the hou&s;e of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and by de&s;troying all the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal,</HI> his image, and his hou&s;e, yet after wards, this pri|&s;oner per&s;uaded <HI>Jehu</HI> to for&s;ake the Lord God, and to wor&s;hip the golden calves. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was full of zeal for the Lord God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; but the pri&s;oner per&s;uaded him, that he ought to do many things again&s;t the name of Je&s;us, and therefore he made havock of the Church, by committing men and women unto pri&s;on, and putting them to death; and carried his per&s;ecuttons unto &s;trange Cities.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner has al&s;o &s;et many good men one again&s;t another, and cau&s;ed needle&s;s divi&s;ions, and &s;eparations in the Church of God upon very &s;light and unnece&s;&s;ary grounds; from whence have ri&s;en bloody per&s;ections, and uncharitable cen&s;ures one of another, and at other times the &s;pirit of railing, backbiting, and &s;landcring of each other. Some he has &s;et in public pulpits to vilify and con|temn others, and to write books &s;ubver&s;ive of unity, peace, and concord, as is plainly manife&s;t in the Author of the Skeleton. At fir&s;t, when he began to preach, he, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, carried him|&s;elf lovingly to tho&s;e who&s;e opinions were dif|ferent from his own. But after awhile he began to give place to, and entertain the pri&s;oner, Mr. Partial Charity, and then he &s;et about his dividing|work, not only with the Arminians, but with; many of the Calvini&s;ts al&s;o; for when a certain Lady would have the ordained Mini&s;ters of her Societies, to make u&s;e of the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> at <HI>R-d,</HI> where &s;ome per|&s;ons of her Society had founded a congregation, and where &s;everal of the Arminians had lent their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to form and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame without di&s;puting about their different opinions; this pri|&s;oner &s;o prevailed in the heart of the Author of the Skeleton, that he &s;aid he would have no form.
<PB N="100" REF="108">
of prayer there; he al&s;o preached a di&s;cour&s;e on "Separate them," and railed again&s;t the Armi|nians, and exhorted them of his own party, to have no fellow&s;hip with them. Another time he preached on, "Only believe."And faid, "I do not care for Mr. <HI>W&mdash;y</HI>'s, nor Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI>'s opinions neither."</P>
<P>Another time, when Mr. <HI>M&mdash;nw&mdash;r&mdash;g,</HI> who had been at great expence to form a congregation at <HI>R-d.</HI> came with &s;everal others, to &s;ettle Preachers in connection with the Author of the Skeleton, he, by the in&s;tigation of the pri&s;oner, would not agree to any thing that was propo&s;ed; but went on with his &s;eparating work, till he had not only &s;eparated the Arminians from the congregation, but the Calvini&s;ts one from another; and to com|pleat the whole, the pri&s;oner helped him to com|po&s;e his Skeleton al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Judge then &s;aid, there needeth no farther evidence; for there is enough &s;aid again&s;t him already.</P>
<P>The Judge then a&s;ked the pri&s;oner if he had any thing to reply, in an&s;wer to what the&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es had &s;aid again&s;t him? Who an&s;wered, My Lord, I refer that to my Coun&s;el, and hope your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;ed to hear two or three per&s;ons in my behalf, To which the Judge gave con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, Mr. Party-Zeal, who &s;aid, My Lord. I have known the pri&s;oner a long time, and have often heard him &s;ay, that it was every man's right to defend his own party, property, or opinion&s;, and that he would have all men &s;o to do; and to a&s;&s;ert their own right again&s;t all per|&s;ons who would oppo&s;e them, or with-hold that from them which they ought to have; but if any per&s;ons went beyond this, it ought to be laid at the door of tho&s;e who cau&s;ed it &s;o to be done; as was the ca&s;e between <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and his brethren. There we find Envy moved them to &s;ell their brother, and not the pri&s;oner: and whatever ma&s;|&s;acres, murders, wars, &amp;c. have happened, in the
<PB N="101" REF="109">
world, your Lord&s;hip knows, that pride, ambition, covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;pite, malice, envy, &amp;c. &s;et the ac|tors to commit &s;uch wicked deeds; as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI>; there malice, envy, and hatred, &s;et <HI>Cain</HI> to work to kill his brother; and the Jews, when they killed the Lord of life and glory, there pride, ambition, and cruelty &s;et them to work; as they did the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors afterwards in the ten bloody per&s;ecutions carried on again&s;t the Chri&s;tians. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of per&s;ecutions and unju&s;t wars; all the&s;e were carried on by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e, and &s;uch like, that I have named, and this was in defence of their own rights, and authorities. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of religious di&s;putes, as each per&s;on has a right to defend his own principles, this made the pri&s;oner a&s;&s;i&s;t in compiling the Skeleton: and he would do the &s;ame on the other &s;ide, with any one who would an&s;wer the Author in the &s;ame &s;pirit; for he would as willingly help them al&s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Fal&s;e-Zeal was then called, and &s;aid as follows:</P>
<P>My Lord, as the pri&s;oner has been &s;et in a very bad light by the witne&s;&s;es for the crown, I hope to be able to give a better account of him; for it is but ju&s;t that we &s;hould &s;peak of his good deeds, and not accu&s;e him of things that are bad, when other per&s;ons have done them. For, my Lord, he has helped to do many a good deed. When the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;mote the Kings of <HI>Canaan,</HI> &amp;c. he taught them to have no charity for them, be|cau&s;e the Lord had commanded that they &s;hould be utterly de&s;troyed; he taught King <HI>Saul</HI> to have partial charity for <HI>Agag,</HI> King of the <HI>Amalekites</HI>; but as &s;oon as he found that the Lord would not have him &s;pared, he then per&s;uaded <HI>Samuel</HI> to cut <HI>Agag</HI> to pieces before the Lord. He al&s;o per|&s;uaded <HI>Elijah</HI> the Prophet not to &s;pare <HI>Baal</HI>'s fal&s;e Prophets; but to de&s;troy them all. The &s;ame he did by <HI>Jehu</HI> in per&s;uading him to kill all the wor&s;hippers of <HI>Baal</HI>: and many other the like, as In the ca&s;e of <HI>Paul,</HI> who, while he thought the
<PB N="102" REF="110">
di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were wrong, he per|&s;uaded him to make havock of them; but as &s;oon as <HI>Paul</HI> was convinced of his mi&s;take, the pri|&s;oner then left off per&s;uading him. thinking it wrong &s;o to do. And with re&s;pect to the &s;ub|&s;equent wars, per&s;ecutions, and other things, of which the pri&s;oner &s;tands charged, he always ad|vi&s;ed per&s;ons to right thrm&s;elves when they were aggrieved, and he was for the laws of Kings and Princes, &amp;c. to be obeyed. And if the &s;ubjects thought they were ill u&s;ed, he advi&s;ed them to de|&s;end them&s;elves in what they thought was right; but when any of them were convinced they were wrong the pri&s;oner then advi&s;ed them no farther, but left them to do as they plea&s;ed. He al&s;o &s;trove to plea&s;e all men, by advi&s;ing them to defend them&s;elves again&s;t all injuries; and in the ca&s;e of robberies, &amp;c. he only &s;aid that no man ought to &s;tarve, and therefore advi&s;ed per&s;ons to get their living &s;ome way or other; but left the way of doing it to them&s;elves. And if they got it hone&s;tly, he made no ebjection thereto. But the truth is, when Mr. Partial Charity had given per&s;ons the be&s;t advice he could, they would call in ambition, covetou&s;ne&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ion, revenge, cruelty, &amp;c. to help them to perform the work they cho&s;e to have done: &s;o that it was they who did tho&s;e evil deeds, and not the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Mr. Right-Self was then called, and &s;aid. My Lord, I have known the pri&s;oner for many ages, and can &s;ay that he always appeared to me to act in a very right and proper manner; for he always coun&s;elled per&s;ons to take care of, and right them|&s;elve on any per&s;ons who had done them any in|jury, and advi&s;ed all men in power, not to &s;uffer their law; and dignity to be trampled upon, or evaded; not to act like the&s;e mean &s;pirits who would &s;uffer them&s;elves to te trodden down by others: but to &s;hew a ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t all offenders, and not to &s;uffer innovations either in Church or State, but to defend the good old way, e&s;tabli&s;hed by their forefathers, &s;uch as Pagani&s;m,
<PB N="103" REF="111">
Judai&s;m, or Popery. Now in doing the&s;e things, the oppo&s;ite parties would cau&s;e much trouble, &s;o that there was no putting an end to tho&s;e troubles but by violent mea&s;ures, which often brought on per&s;ecutions, &amp;c. from hence came tho&s;e evils &s;o complained of. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of wars and other evils, by one kingdom claiming a right to be obeyed or &s;ubmitted to by another, in what they &s;ell out about. And as Mr. Partial Charity often thought that the other parties were op|pre&s;&s;ed too much, he advi&s;ed them to make a noble &s;tand again&s;t their foes who oppre&s;&s;ed them. He often very ju&s;tly advi&s;ed the Prote&s;tants to with|&s;tand the Papi&s;ts, when they were oppre&s;&s;ed by them; and per&s;uaded all tho&s;e who were oppre&s;&s;ed by their neighbours, to defend them&s;elves, and advi&s;ed nations to go to war with other nations, upon the &s;ame grounds; and all others of the like nature, he always &s;aid, that each party ought to right it&s;elf. But both &s;ides would often call in inju&s;tice and cruelty, to help them to fini&s;h the work they had begun, and therefore &s;uch doings ought not to be charged to the pri&s;oner, but to them. It is true the pri&s;oner was called upon to carry on a pro&s;ecution again&s;t Mr. Univer&s;al Cha|rity, becau&s;e if he is &s;uffered to dwell in the hearts of all men, there would be nothing for the pri|&s;oner to do, to maintain him&s;elf and family, and then he and they would be quite &s;tarved, which is what his pro&s;ecutor, and the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, want. And though he advi&s;ed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in compiling the Skeleton, yet the Author would al&s;o employ, envy and ill-will, if not hatred and malice, to do the greate&s;t part thereof; and the pri&s;oner by nature cannot love all men, e&s;pecially Univer&s;al Charity, and thinks that he has an un|doubted right to love him&s;elf and friends above all others, it being his nature &s;o to do. I therefore cannot &s;ee who can blame him for doing as he has done in the whole affair.</P>
<P>Mr. Self-Defence, the pri&s;oner's Coun&s;el then &s;aid, My Lord, as Coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, I hope
<PB N="104" REF="112">
the Court will permit me to &s;peak a few words in his behalf, who, my Lord, is here charged with many and great evils by him committed. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that it chiefly turns on what things he has given his advice in, and not that he did tho&s;e things him&s;elf. In the ca&s;e of <HI>Cain,</HI> he only advi&s;ed him to a&s;&s;ert his right as the fir&s;t born; but his carrying it &s;o far as to kill his brother, was his own fault, by calling in hatred, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the murder. The Antediluvians were urged on in their wicked cour&s;es by Mr. Violence, who carried the day at that time. And <HI>Nimrod</HI> was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his hunting by Mr. Am|bition, if he hunted men in&s;tead of bea&s;ts; if the latter, there could be no harm at all in it. As for <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> he encouraged hardne&s;s of heart to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his oppre&s;&s;ions. And envy moved the Patriarchs to &s;ell their brother <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> into <HI>Egypt.</HI> The Jewi&s;h High-Prie&s;t, and Elders, by their fore|father's laws and cu&s;toms, contrary to the law of God, crucified Chri&s;t, and per&s;ecuted his di&s;|ciples; not knowing that he was the Lord of life and glory. The following per&s;ecutions carried on by the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, were cau&s;ed by pride and ambition, and in defence of their gods whom they wor&s;hipped; and that has been the cau&s;e in all per&s;ecutions, by per&s;ons being led to e&s;teem their own opinions in preference to others, and encouraging, &s;pite, malice, and ill-will again&s;t all other per&s;ons, for thinking different from them, which is cau&s;ed by one Partial Zeal, a blind bigotted fellow, who often takes right for wrong, and wrong for right. As for unju&s;t wars they are mo&s;tly began and carried on, through ambition and thir&s;t of power, &amp;c. And as for Mr. Partial Charity, each per&s;on only had advice of him, and then took his own Coun&s;el, and employed whom he plea&s;ed, in all manner of evil, either in per&s;e|cutions, unju&s;t wars, or in murders, robberies and the like.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a per&s;on kept out of his ju&s;t right, goes to a Coun&s;ellor for advice, who tells him
<PB N="105" REF="113">
how to proceed according to Law, he then goes away and plunders or murders the per&s;on who kept him out of his right; ought his doing &s;o to be laid to the Coun&s;ellor's charge? who had not advi&s;ed him to rob or murder? Certainly not. As for vexatious Law-&s;uits, they are often prolonged by the per&s;ons employed. So that upon the whole I think the pri&s;oner not &s;o bad a per&s;on as he is repre&s;ented to be, and therefore think he ought to be acquitted.</P>
<P>Mr. Divine Rea&s;on the Coun&s;el for the crown, then replied. My Lord, I ob&s;erve, that neither the per&s;ons in behalf of the pri&s;oner, nor his Coun&s;el, have proved him not guilty of the things charged again&s;t him; but have &s;trove to &s;ix the crimes on other per&s;ons. But who &s;hould they be? but tho&s;e very per&s;ons who are in con|federacy with him and ready to do any &s;ort of wicked work; and are all of the family and off|&s;pring of &s;in and Satan. And to be &s;hort, the pri|&s;oner is one who fir&s;t breaks the peace, and then calls his wicked companions to do the re&s;t of the work, be it ever &s;o bad. For were Mr. Divine Charity, or even Mr. Univer&s;al Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, to reign and rule in the hearts of all men, and they to love their neighbours as them&s;elves, and love their enemies al&s;o, then we &s;hould have none of this wicked work carried on in the world; at lea&s;t, not &s;o much of it by far. It is the want of Divine and Univer&s;al Charity, ruling in the hearts of all men, that gives too much room for Partial Cha|rity to reign there, and to introduce his wicked confederates with him, and when they are once got into the heart of any one; there is no power on earth can ca&s;t them out: none but power from on high, can remove or &s;ubdue them.</P>
<P>The judge then directed his &s;peech to the Jury, and &s;aid: Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard what the witne&s;&s;es have &s;aid in proof again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar, in which they have charged him with, aiding, advi&s;ing, and abetting, Various wicked per&s;ons, in murders, per&s;ecutions, &amp;c.
<PB N="106" REF="114">
And you have heard what his witne&s;&s;es have &s;aid in his favour. Now, if you are fully per&s;uaded in your minds that he is a Spirit come from God, and not in connection with the &s;pirits of darkne&s;s, you are in this ca&s;e to acquit him. But if you are per&s;uaded that he is of Satan, and in league with &s;in, and a branch of &s;in and Satan's family, you are then to bring him in Guilty. I therefore would have you bring in your Verdict as &s;oon as you can.</P>
<P>The Jury then withdrew, and in a few minutes, being agreed, they brought their Verdict, Guilty. At which many in the Court rejoiced.</P>
<P>The Judge then proceeded to pa&s;s &s;entence on the pri&s;oner; but fir&s;t a&s;ked him, if he had any thing to &s;ay why &s;entence, according to the Law; &s;hould not be pronounced again&s;t him?</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner &s;aid, My Lord, I hope your Lord|&s;hip will take pity on my very old age, and con|&s;ider that what I have done was done according to the dictates of my nature. And your Lord&s;hip knows, that I cannot do any thing contrary there|to; for nature cannot overcome nature, or renew it&s;elf. Nothing but grace can do that. Be&s;ide, my Lord, it was others that committed tho&s;e crimes charged again&s;t me, and carried matters too far, as the per&s;ons in my behalf have proved. Therefore, in mercy my Lord, be as favourable to me as you can, and con&s;ider that you are acting under the Go&s;pel of mercy, and in the name of the God of mercy.</P>
<P>The Judge's Sentence.</P>
<P>Judge. Mr. Uncharitable, alias, Partial Charity, the evidence is clear again&s;t thee; and as for thy age, in re&s;pect of which thou crave&s;t pity, it is a pity that thou ha&s;t lived &s;o long, to do &s;uch great and general mi&s;chiefs, as the&s;e good men have witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t thee. But the reward of thy deeds is eternal death: this is the King of Kings everla&s;ting and unchangeable decree, again&s;t all manner of &s;in, and every branch and offspring
<PB N="107" REF="115">
thereof, of which thou art a principal branch: hear therefore thy &s;entence. Thou Mr. Uncha|ritable, or otherwi&s;e called Partial Charity, ha&s;t by this name been tried for various outrages, murders, robberies, &amp;c. in confederacy with others; and art found guilty by the be&s;t of Juries. But as the Go&s;pel-Law doth not give power to any Spiritual Court, to put any man to death about &s;piritual things; and as it is contrary al&s;o to the example of the holy apo&s;tles; I mu&s;t pa&s;s &s;entence according to the tenor of the Go&s;pel|Law, which is, That thou Partial Charity &s;halt be carried back to the pri&s;on from whence thou came&s;t, and there be kept clo&s;e pri&s;oner, under the care and charge of Mr. New-Man, the Gaoler, until all thy members are mortified, and crucified, with every vile affection and lu&s;t, until the whole body of &s;in be de&s;troyed; and until thou and all thy confederates, being the offspring of &s;in and Satan, peri&s;h in the hearts of all tho&s;e of every denomination who have, or &s;hall truly put on Chri&s;t, and who are, or &s;hall be renewed by the &s;pirit of his grace.</P>
<P>Therefore Mr. New-Man, take the pri&s;oner, and &s;ee that the &s;entence, through the power and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace, be fully executed; and when the King of Kings &s;hall come to judge the world, then &s;hall the pri&s;oner, with every branch and offspring of &s;in, and all his confederates and adherents of every kind, together with them|&s;elves, be doomed to dwell in everla&s;ting burn|ings; being ca&s;t into the lake of fire and brim|&s;tone, where the &s;moke of their torment &s;hall a&s;cend up for ever and ever. As &s;oon as this dreadful &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed on the pri&s;oner the Court broke up.</P>
<P>Note, That not only &s;in, which is a &s;piritual evil. both in the fallen angels, and men, will be &s;eparated from God; but all the adherents of &s;in and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, who die in an un|pardoned and unrenewed &s;tate, will dwell for ever in the regions of endle&s;s woe; being
<PB N="108" REF="116">
puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction, from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</P>

<P>There are many more fal&s;e quotations in this Skeleton; many of which &s;eem to be made by de&s;ign, to give his opinions the greater appearance of truth, which per&s;ons not ob&s;erving, may think that the Scriptures &s;peak the &s;ame things he doth. As to his calling <HI>Ehjah, Samuel, David,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, Calvini&s;ts, the Arminians might with equal propriety call them Arminians, the Papi&s;ts call them Papi&s;ts, and the Antinomians call them Antinomians; and &s;o might every other &s;ect and denomination of Chri&s;tians. As in &s;everal places he has called the word <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> imputed righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, others have an equal right to call it, in|herent righteou&s;ne&s;s, others legal righteou&s;ne&s;s, and others moral righteou&s;ne&s;s; and thus each would call it by what name they plea&s;ed, and &s;o confound the meaning of the word.</P>
<P>As for the &s;pirit in which he has written, few Chri&s;tians, I think, can approve of it; as it is quite contrary to the meek and loving &s;pirit of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and &s;uch as He has no where countenanced, either by precept or example; but rather the rever&s;e, as Luke ix. 55, 56. But this &s;pirit of Univer&s;al Charity he is highly offended at, and would have it quite bani&s;hed out of the world, and Partial Charity introduced in its &s;tead. In &s;uch a ca&s;e we &s;hould all have a fair pretence, to &s;et at nought, and hate all tho&s;e who di&s;&s;er from our opinions. But to the &s;hame and con|demnation of &s;uch a &s;pirit as is carried on in the Skeleton, the Holy Scripture teacheth that we mu&s;t love our enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us, and do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e us, and per&s;ecute us; and follow peace with all men: which is as far from the &s;pirit of Partial Charity, as heaven is from hell. And the unchri&s;tian &s;pirit he has
<PB N="111" REF="119">
&s;hewn in the letters which he has publi&s;hed at the end of his Skeleton, on which I &s;hall add a few more remarks.</P>
<P>Page 184. "Not a man that holds univer&s;al re|demption, becau&s;e he has got more redemption than the Bible."</P>
<P>The Bible &s;aith, Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man, and gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, and is the propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world.</P>
<P>Page 186. "I know &s;ome who &s;eldom mention the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for fear of crying down inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>I &s;hould wonder if they often mentioned a righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is <HI>never</HI> mentioned in the Scrip|ture.</P>
<P>Page 189. "I read of the &s;ecrets of God's eter|nal elcction being with the righteous. P&s;ahn xxv. 14. Prov. iii. 32. jer. xxiii. 18."</P>
<P>In neither of the&s;e places is one word &s;poken about election, much le&s;s of eternal election, which cannot be found in the Bible.</P>
<P>Page 194. "A coar&s;e Coal-heaver is as likely an in&s;trument to lay God's axe to the root of bar|ren &s;inners, as a Lady's pin-&s;ticker."</P>
<P>This he &s;peaks concerning a young man who preached in one of his places, and offended him, in &s;peaking about <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> being learned in all the learning of the <HI>Egyplians,</HI> which he thought was po'nted at him, as he is quite illiterate. Therefore he calls him, "this advocate for gip&s;y's wi&s;dom," and, "this young quack in par&s;onic robes."</P>
<P>Page 203. "All who run un&s;ent of God, let them get their matter and manner from <HI>Benjamin Keach,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, God has quartered them, at the &s;ign of the den of thieves."</P>
<P>Page 209. "<HI>Noah</HI> preached imputed righteou&s;|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;ee this in the Scripture before we be|lieve it. Mentioning how we receive ju&s;tifying faith, and reconciliation with God, he &s;ays,</P>
<P>Page 211. "From that moment we are as &s;ure never to be damned, as there is a God in heaven."</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="120">
Is not this contrary to Prov. xxviii. 14. P&s;alm cxxviii. 1. Heb. iv. 1?</P>
<P>Page 216. "Therefore do not marvel, if God turns Coal-heavers into Commentators, light and perfection, we prove to be Chri&s;t the true light."</P>
<P>But he takes care not to add, "That was the true light, which lighteth <HI>every man</HI> that cometh into the world." John i. 9.</P>
<P>Page 233. "If you know the pardon of your &s;ins, the liberty of God's Spirit, and enjoy union and communion with Chri&s;t, you are wi&s;e to &s;al|vation though you never read any book but the Bible."</P>
<P>This is one of the be&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in his book. I wi&s;h it had abounded with more of this &s;ort, and le&s;s of his bitter zeal, and uncharitable contention, again&s;t tho&s;e who are the children of God.</P>
<P>Page 234. "It was the holy re&s;olution of the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> not to build on another man's foun|dation. I have ob&s;erved &s;ome who are very fond of breaking through all bounds into man's labour; and with a party &s;pirit, and a fiery zeal, will draw a wonderful train after them, both bad and good; and if they can chain them up in a bigotted &s;pirit, and get them to hate the poor pa&s;tor that fir&s;t be|gat them, then they &s;ay, we hav&eacute; e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and if the father of this run-away &s;lock exclaim again&s;t tho&s;e thievi&s;h mea&s;ures, then the&s;e &s;cattering gentlemen call it, being per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake."</P>
<P>In the&s;e lines, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> has truly de&s;cribed his own conduct, in the affair at <HI>R-d,</HI> before &s;poken of; when he &s;eparated the congregation at that place, which was gathered by others before he came there.</P>
<P>Page 237. "The apo&s;tles them&s;elves ca&s;t lots to chu&s;e a Mini&s;ter, in the place of <HI>Judas,</HI> and the lot fell upon <HI>Matthias,</HI> thus the lot of man fell on <HI>Matthias,</HI> but the Saviour's lot fell on <HI>Saul</HI> of <HI>Tar&s;us.</HI>"</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>H.</HI> plainly in&s;inuates, that the lot ca&s;t by the apo&s;tles, was not of God, but of men.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="121">
Page 238. "All tho&s;e per&s;ons who communicate a narrow contracted &s;pirit to a &s;lock, or &s;ix pre|judice on the minds of &s;imple &s;ouls, who divide the affecions of a Society, and &s;catter di&s;cord among them, are &s;eeds-men of Satan."</P>
<P>W. H. <HI>Thou art the very man.</HI></P>
<P>Page 240. "When you &s;ee &s;heep-&s;tealers come tumbling over God's hedges, do not act the part of a dumb dog: but bark and bite too; for God makes us &s;harp thre&s;hing in&s;truments having teeth; as &s;lails, we mu&s;t keep beating: and as we have teeth we mu&s;t u&s;e them; but only with the Wolves, and the Foxes, who come to &s;teal the lambs."</P>
<P>Thus the Author ends his Skeleton, in the &s;ame &s;pirit he began it, from which &s;pirit may the Lord in mercy deliver the children of God! And that we may learn what &s;pirit we ought to be of, and how we ought to treat tho&s;e who differ from us in things not e&s;&s;ential, let us con&s;ider the account given in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ciples forbad one who was ca&s;ting out devils in the name of Chri&s;t, he &s;aid unto them, "Forbid him not; for he that is not again&s;t us is for us;" and when the Samaritans would not receive him, his di&s;ciples a&s;ked leave, to call fire down from heaven to con&s;ume them; but he &s;aid, "Ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of; for the Son of Man is not come to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them. Hence we learn that our Lord would not permit his di&s;ciples to forbid others to do good, though they did not fol|low him; nor would he inflict judgments on tho&s;e who would not receive him. To the &s;ame pur|po&s;e St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, Why do&s;t thou judge thy brother? or, Why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy brother? for we &s;hall all &s;tand before the judg|ment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t. And St. <HI>James</HI> &s;aith, "Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that &s;peaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, &s;peaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge." From.
<PB N="114" REF="122">
which pa&s;&s;ages we learn, That the &s;pirit and conduct of Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and of all who are like|minded with him, are diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>H.</HI> I dare not reprobate him for his mere opinions, though I totally di&s;approve of mo&s;t of them. But I entirely condemn that bit|terne&s;s, and unchri&s;tian rancour, which he has di&s;played on this, and various other occa&s;ions. Yet the wor&s;t thing I wi&s;h him is, to be throughly convinced of the great impropriety of indulging that fooli&s;h, and ridiculous bigotry, and almo&s;t unparalleled &s;currility; and that he may &s;ee, be|fore it be too late, that the wrath of man worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let all who wi&s;h to be fol|lowers of the meek and lowly Je&s;us, put on, <HI>as the elect of God, holy and beloved,</HI> bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long|&s;uffering: forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a quarrel again&s;t any about opinions, or any thing el&s;e; even as Chri&s;t forgave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye. Thus let us earne&s;tly, <HI>zealou&s;ly,</HI> follow peace with all men, and &s;trive to plca&s;e our neighbour, every man for his good to edification. For if we do this, we &s;hall meet with the approbation of all wi&s;e and candid men, and have a con&s;cience void of offence, towards God and towards man, and meet with the high appro|bation of our Lord, when he cometh in the clouds of heaven.</P>

<P>A FARTHER CHECK TO UNCHARITABLENESS: OR AN ANSWER to a SERMON Preached at GRUB-STREET, by the Rev. Mr. C. on Sunday the 13th of March, 1791.</P>

<HEAD>A FARTHER CHECK, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;urpri&s;ing, that per&s;ons, who profe&s;s to be led by the Spirit of God, &s;hould &s;hew &s;uch an uncharitable, and unchri&s;tian temper towards tho&s;e who differ from them in &s;ome points of doc|trine; who are not content to point out the dif|ferent opinions they oppo&s;e, but mu&s;t vilify and defame the per&s;ons they oppo&s;e, and ca&s;t out their names as evil, while living and then, like the Papi&s;ts of old, vent their &s;pleen and rancour upon them after they are dead, and gone.</P>
<P>A per&s;on of this uncharitable &s;pirit has lately appeared in a Sermon on Luke vi. 37. "Judge not, and ye &s;hall not be judged."</P>
<P>In which he &s;ays, page 3, "That out of the heart (naturally) proceeds evil thoughts re&s;pecting our neighbour, contrary to that pa&s;&s;age in 1 Cor. xiii. 5. "Love thinketh no evil." And in page 4, he &s;ays, "Chri&s;t exhorteth, to judge not according to appearance, but to judge righteous judgment." But we &s;hall &s;ee how &s;oon this Author forgets both tho&s;e texts; for in his 9th and 10th pages, he pleads for a right to judge per&s;ons by their doctrines, and argues for a right to di&s;pute with them about what he, in his great wi&s;dom thinks to be right, as if his opinions alone were the &s;tandard of truth. But in his 11th page he &s;ays, "To di&s;pute again&s;t the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, or on any part of it is a very great &s;in."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="125">
"But to di&s;pute for the truth of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel is the priviledge of all Chri&s;tians, as well as of all Mini&s;ters: but not to di&s;play their abili|ties, and overcome their opponents." Yet he &s;ays in contradiction to this, page 12, "When there had been much di&s;puting, <HI>Peter</HI> ro&s;e up, and he began to di&s;pute with them, and overcame them." So then <HI>Peter</HI> di&s;played his abilities, and overcame his opponents. In the 14th page he is offended at (Mini&s;ters and people) who are called Calvini&s;ts becau&s;e they &s;ay, "Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> is gone to heaven." But he &s;ays, "I will not &s;ay he is; and though I am not po&s;itive that what they have &s;aid is fal&s;e vet I have my doubts of it, till I &s;ee from the Pre&s;s a recantation of his principles." "Some per&s;ons may &s;ay you ought not to preach again&s;t per&s;ons, but again&s;t fal&s;e doctrines, a child under the tuition of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> would have &s;miled at that, becau&s;e it is preaching again&s;t a non|entity. If fal&s;e doctrines cxi&s;t, they exi&s;t in per|&s;ons and it is the per&s;on who mu&s;t &s;uffer, not the doctrines."</P>
<P>He now comes to the charge, page 15, "Now as a proof that what I &s;aid of Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> is true, viz. That he was a fal&s;e prophet or teacher, every man who denies the doctrine of God's &s;overeign election of grace, denies the greate&s;t truth in the Bible; he &s;peaks lies in hypocri&s;y, and mu&s;t be a fal&s;e prophet; there is no doubt of it, among tho&s;e who believe, and know the truth."</P>
<P>He &s;hould have &s;aid, among &s;ome of tho&s;e who hold his opinions, and with him believe that, "the doctrine" (he calls) "God's &s;overeign elec|tion of grace" is, "the greate&s;t truth in the Bible."</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That per&s;on who &s;ets up what he may call, God's &s;overeign election of grace, by repre&s;enting the God of truth and love, as if he were a Tyrant, is not &s;etting forth the greate&s;t truth in the Bible. If we look at the life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we &s;hall &s;ee that he never &s;hewed the Spirit of a Tyrant; but on the contrary.
<PB N="119" REF="126">
blamed per&s;ons for not coming to him that they might have life. So far was he from tyranny, that when the <HI>Samaritans</HI> would not receive him, at which his di&s;ciples were offended, and re|que&s;ted leave to call down fire from heaven to con&s;ume them; he meekly an&s;wered, "Ye know not what &s;pirit ye are of: for the Son of Man is not come to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them." Luke ix. 51.-56. Nor was there the lea&s;t &s;hadow of tyranny in our Lord's life, who &s;hewed forth perfect love and charity to his enemies, and was often grieved for the hardne&s;s of their hearts; which would have been quite ab&s;urd, if God's &s;overeign election of grace, as &s;ome &s;ay, is, that he ab&s;olutely rejects the far greater part of man|kind, and &s;aves others by an irre&s;i&s;tible power, which none can re&s;i&s;t. On this principle of ab|&s;olute prede&s;tination, any Mini&s;ter who holds this doctrine, con&s;i&s;tent with his principles, might &s;ay, "If any among you are of the number of the number of the elect, I have the be&s;t news, to tell you that your ears ever heard; it is for you, the elect, that Chri&s;t died, and for none el&s;e; and you will be as infallibly &s;aved as if you were in heaven already, there is no doubt to be made of it; for there arc no conditions for you to perform, as in &s;uch a ca&s;e you would be &s;eeking &s;alvation by works. Your attempting to do any thing, would be Popery. You have nothing to do, but believe; for Chri&s;t has done all for you. You are already &s;aved; but you know it not. You were ju&s;ti&s;ied in the &s;ight of God before the foundation of the world, and as much ju&s;ti&s;ied by the right cou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, while in an unconverted &s;tate, as you will be when converted. But to tho&s;e of you who are reprobates, I have nothing to &s;ay, but what will increa&s;e your condemnation. For you cannot be &s;aved, as Chri&s;t died only for his &s;heep, and not for you. And were you to do any thing to obtain the favour of God, you would be &s;eeking &s;alvation by works. And though I bid all that hear me, to believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I
<PB N="120" REF="127">
mean only tho&s;e who are of the election of grace; for all others could not believe a lie, and I &s;hould be only preaching &s;alvation by works. Though Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> &s;ays, "He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved," this Author &s;ays, If there be any one, who can prove to me, that this his way of &s;alvation, is not &s;alvation by works, I will give up my Bible." And though &s;uch a Preacher may &s;ay, he ought to preach free &s;alvation to all, becau&s;e he does not know who are of the elect, till they are converted, yet I think on the grounds of ab&s;olute prede&s;ti|nation, he cannot but think that all the&s;e whom he concludes are reprobated, though they will be as infallibly damned, as if they were in heaven already, and that his preaching to them is of no u&s;e, but to torment them before the time.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, we believe, that one of the greate&s;t truths in the Bible is, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord was "the brightne&s;s of his Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on." Heb. i. 3. And as St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays in his Go&s;pel, i. 14, "the word was made &s;te&s;h and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth," &s;o that no tyranny, which &s;ome men calls &s;overeignty, is to be found in him; who &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, Luke xxii. 25. 26, 27. "The Kings of the Gentiles cxerci&s;e Lord&s;hip over them, and they that ex|erci&s;e authority upon them, are called benefactors. But ye &s;hall not be &s;o, but he that is the greate&s;t among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief, as he that doth &s;erve. I am among you as he that &s;erveth." And he &s;aid. John v. 19, 20. "The Son can do nothing of him&s;elf, but what he &s;eeth the Father do: for what things &s;oever he doeth, the&s;e al&s;o doeth the Son likewi&s;e. For the Father loveth the Son, and &s;heweth him all things that him&s;elf doeth." We therefore conclude; that the Judge of all the earth will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that his tender mercies are over all his works; that Chri&s;t, "gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all," 1 Tim. ii. 6, and "is the pro|pitiation
<PB N="121" REF="128">
for the &s;ins of the whole world." 1 John ii. 2.</P>
<P>According to the 31&s;t Article of our Church, "The offering of Chri&s;t once made, is that per|fect redemption, propitiation, and &s;atisfaction for all the &s;ins of the whole world, both original and actual, &amp;c." And in the Collects for Good-Friday it is &s;aid, "O merciful God, who hath made all men, and hateth nothing that thou ha&s;t made, nor woulde&s;t the death of a &s;inner, but rather that he &s;hould be converted and live." &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Author of this Sermon, &s;peaks, as if he only knew the mind of the Lord, and had been of his council. And as he doubts if Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> is gone to heaven, I fear he has &s;ecret hopes that he is not. But this I leave to his own con&s;cience, and to the ju&s;t judgment of God. But ob&s;erve, that no one has any ju&s;t right to determine ab&s;o|lutely what is the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of Holy Scripture, but for him&s;elf; according to the light God is plea&s;ed to impart unto him. For his own judgment becomes a mutter of faith to him&s;elf; but not to another, except he embrace the &s;ame. For the opinion of another does not become an article of faith to me, except I believe the &s;ame. The apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;avs, 1 Cor. xiii. 9, 10. "For we know in part, and we prophecy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part &s;hall be done away." "For we now &s;ee through a gla&s;s, darkly; but then face to face; now I &s;hall know in part; but then &s;hall I know even as al&s;o I am known." If we knew perfectly, the whole will of God, we might then have &s;ome grounds to think our judgment infal|lible, and could then declare in ju&s;t terms, what is right or wrong. But even then, we could not have any ju&s;t right to condemn another, becau&s;e he thought different from us, except we had more right in this ca&s;e than our Lord, which would be bold pre&s;umption &s;o to imagine much le&s;s as we know but in part, and &s;ee through a gla&s;s, darkly. For thus &s;aith our Lord, John xii. 47, 48, "If any

man hear my words, and belive not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to &s;ave the world. He that rejecteth me, and re|ceiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have &s;poken, the &s;ame &s;hall judge him in the la&s;t day."</P>
<P>How incon&s;i&s;tent mu&s;t it be, not only to charity but to our Lord's example, for us to lake the liberty to judge, and condemn another, becau&s;e he thinks other wi&s;e than we do; this is certainly acting contrary to our Lord's commands in the text: for if we cannot convince him of his errors, we &s;hould leave him to the judgment of the la&s;t day. But this Author &s;eems but little to regard our Lord's words, by his condemning of per&s;ons for fal&s;e prophets, becau&s;e they hold not his opinions. From &s;uch uncharitable di&s;po&s;itions, all manner of per&s;ecutions, on the &s;core of re|ligion hath ri&s;en. But we doubt not, that God who hath &s;et &s;uch high marks of his approbation on Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> will &s;et his character in a true light at the la&s;t day, with well done good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord, and then we &s;hall &s;ee an innumerable company of holy men of every denomination of Chri&s;tians, as well as Arminians and Calvini&s;ts, who will join to|gether to prai&s;e the Lord to all eternity.</P>
<P>Page 16. In his note, he quotes, "many bre|thren" which many he &s;ays, confutes the Ar|minians <HI>all</HI> which we will a little examine. If the word <HI>all</HI> be taken in a limited &s;en&s;e for many, what ab&s;urdity will &s;low therefrom. As in Rom. iii. 23, "For all have &s;inned," that is, many have &s;inned. Gal. iii. 22, "The Scripture hath con|cluded all under &s;in," that is many. Rom. v. 12. "So death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned," that is, death pa&s;&s;ed upon many, for many have &s;inned, and ver&s;e 18, "As by the of|fence of one judgment came upon all men to con|demnation; <HI>even &s;o</HI> by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men to ju&s;tification of life." Here the judgment and condemnation are

not on all, but many! In Matt. xxv. 32, "Before him &s;hall be gathered all nations," that is, many nations. John v. 28, 29. "For the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves &s;hall hear his voice, and come forth." That is, many &s;hall come forth. Heb. xii. 23, "To God the Judge of all." That is, of many. Jude xv. "To execute judg|ment upon all, and to convince all that are un|godly among them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard &s;peeches, which ungodly &s;inners have &s;poken again&s;t him," that is, many, not all. In Daniel xii. 2, "And many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth &s;hall awake, &s;ome to ever|la&s;ting life, and &s;ome to &s;hame, and everla&s;ting contempt."</P>
<P>Here we find the word many u&s;ed for all; but our Author is &s;o unhappy in his limiting of all, to many, that we &s;hould be quite at a lo&s;s to prove a general judgment, according to his &s;en&s;e of the word. Therefore we mu&s;t admit the Scripture all, in its full &s;en&s;e, though this Author may contemn us for &s;o doing.</P>

And &s;ays, Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI>'s words are, "He" (God) "&s;aw them as believers, and as &s;uch, prede&s;tinated them to &s;alvation, according to his eternal decree, viz. he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved." To this he &s;ays,</P>
<P>Page 18. "If there be any one who can prove to me, that this his way of &s;alvation, is not &s;al|vation by works, I will give up my Bible." I think he may as well give it up, if, "he that be|lieveth &s;hall be &s;aved," is &s;alvation by works, be|cau&s;e Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> &s;aid it, as well as the Scriptures. Would not this Author have been very angry if any one had charged him &s;o, from his &s;peaking the&s;e words. Again, he &s;ays, Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> "calls &s;anctification our ju&s;tification." But to refute this Authors, in this very Sermon he quotes,
<PB N="124" REF="131">
Romans viii. 29, 30. Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> a&s;ks, page 10, "Who are glorified? None but tho&s;e who were fir&s;t &s;anctified. Who are &s;anctified? None but tho&s;e Who are fir&s;t ju&s;tified. Who are ju&s;tified? None but tho&s;e who were fir&s;t prede&s;tinated. Who are pre|de&s;tinated? None but tho&s;e whom God foreknew as believers." "He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, he that believeth not &s;hall be damned, and then God is clear from the blood of all men, &s;ince whoever peri&s;hes, peri&s;hes by his own act and deed, and God is &s;till ju&s;tified in his &s;aying, That he willeth all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth."</P>

I for one have not this power; I am an exception from that rule." This is no wonder, when he can vilify and con|temn others on &s;uch fal&s;e grounds as he does Mr. <HI>We&s;ley.</HI> This &s;hews that he is very far from &s;ancti|fication, if not from ju&s;tification al&s;o. He has al&s;o quoted Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI>'s words fal&s;e. The words are in the page he quotes. "All the&s;e upon earth, who are now &s;anctifined, you would find, not one of the&s;e had been &s;anctified, till after he was called. He was fir&s;t called, by the word and me&s;&s;engers of God, likewi&s;e with an inward call; by his &s;pirit applying his word, enabling him to believe in the only begotten Son of God, and bearing te&s;timony with his Spirit that he was a child of God." "Loving God, he loved his neighbour as him&s;elf, and had power to walk in all his com|mandments blamele&s;s." "This is a rule which admits of no exception. God calls a &s;inner his own, that is, ju&s;tifies him, before he &s;anctifies." This la&s;t line belongs to that of no exception, and

not as the Author of the Sermon has pointed and applied it. But he adds, "None of the pro|phets or apo&s;tles had that power."</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, of <HI>Zacharias</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> "Were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blamele&s;s." Therefore the&s;e two had that power.</P>

<P>I am &s;urprized the Author &s;hould find fault with Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> for what he did, &s;ince as a mere machine, he could not do otherwi&s;e. Is not this finding fault with what God does, or decrees? Is it not &s;aying to him; why did&s;t thou make Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> thus? If thou had&s;t made him a Calvini&s;t, he would have been a very u&s;eful man; or if thou had&s;t but obliged him, by thy irre&s;i&s;tible grace at la&s;t, to have renounced his Arminian tenets, and embraced Calvini&s;m, I would have hung my pul|pit in mourning on the occa&s;ion, and have hoped he was gone to heaven. As this Author believes he is a mere machine, and not able to act but as God plea&s;es, if he is guilty of drunkenne&s;s, whore|dom, &s;wearing, lying, fal&s;e accu&s;ations, or railing, &s;landering, &amp;c. he is &s;till a mere machine; he, poor man, cannot help it! If we believed &s;o, it would be wrong for us to find fault with our fellow machines. And if it is as he &s;ays, he ought not to find fault, &s;ince as mere machines, we cannot help what we do. Be&s;ides, if nothing is done, or comes to pa&s;s, but what God has ab|&s;olutely appointed, then every man does the will of God; and therefore this Author ought not to find fault, le&s;t he &s;hould reply again&s;t God, and his own doctrine, which is, that no man can act contrary to God's decrees.</P>

He tells us that, "particular election and repro|bation is the truth of God. Chri&s;t &s;poke of them both in a breath, in Matt. xi. 25," which the Reader is de&s;ired to examine without prejudice.</P>
<P>Page 21, &amp;c. He quotes Rom. ix. 11, 12, 13, which he &s;ays, "Contains &s;overeign election, and &s;overeign reprobation."</P>
<P>The Scripture &s;aith, "The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works," P&s;alm cxlv. 9. I apprehend that tender mercies, and &s;aving mercies are the &s;ame, and are a demon|&s;tration that God willeth not that any &s;hould peri&s;h: for how can his tender mercies belong to the reprobate; who from all eternity he has doomed to endle&s;s damnation: and that by &s;uch an act of &s;overeignty, as they cannot po&s;&s;ibly evade.</P>
<P>Page 22. He &s;ays, "I would ride my hor&s;e to death, to do any of them (the Arminians) a piece of &s;ervice, in body or &s;oul: but I wi&s;h their doc|trines at hell, from whence they came."

Since Chri&s;t is the only foundation of a &s;inner's hope, he that by faith hath Chri&s;t formed in him, "the hope of glory," has a far better ground for his comfort, than what &s;ome men call God's elec|tion; becau&s;e it is doubtful, whether God's elec|tion is &s;uch as they &s;ay it is.

<P>Page 24. "De&s;troy not him with thy meat, for whom Chri&s;t died." Mr. <HI>C.</HI> &s;ays, "this only means, de&s;troying a weak believer's peace." What &s;ophi&s;try is this! For the words are, de&s;troy not <HI>him,</HI> the weak believer, and not a word of de|&s;troying his peace.</P>

I, &s;ays this Author, "an&s;wer, where does he &s;o &s;peak? Not in 1 Tim. ii. 4. for all men there is evidently all &s;orts of men." Evidently! Pray where is the evidence of this?</P>
<P>Page 25.

"Here the Author &s;ays, the creature is made &s;tronger than Chri&s;t." But how contrary to the apo&s;tle's words. Rom. vi. 16. "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his &s;ervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of &s;in unto death, or of obedience unto righteou&s;ne&s;s?"

<P>Page 27. This Author finds fault with Mr. <HI>We&s;ly</HI>'s doctrine of ju&s;tification, and &s;ays, that Chri&s;t, "is more than the cau&s;e of it, he is our ju&s;tification it&s;elf." Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> &s;ays in his Sermon on the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, "To all believers the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is imputed," "When they believe. In that very hour the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is theirs," and &s;ays, "It is true, be|lievers may not all &s;peak alike, and yet their ex|perience may be as &s;ound as ours." Here the Rev. old Gentleman &s;toops to the re&s;t of his brethren in the faith of Chri&s;t, who may think and &s;peak different from him in &s;ome things.</P>
<P>Page 28. He &s;ays, "Tho&s;e who are of the elec|tion of grace, were ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God before the foundations of the earth were laid, &s;o that they are as much ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's righ|teou&s;ne&s;s while in an unconverted &s;tate, as they are in a converted &s;tate." This is contrary to what St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, Eph. ii. 3. "and were by na|ture the children of wrath, even as others," which could not be, if they were ju&s;tified before the foundations of the earth. Be&s;ide St. <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;ays Rom. iii. 24, 25. "Being ju&s;tified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom God hath &s;et forth to be a pro|pitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t through the forbearance of God." and 28, "Therefore we conclude, that a man is ju&s;tified by faith, without the deeds of the law." And we find in the 4th chapter, that <HI>Abraham</HI>'s faith was counted or imputed unto him for righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o will ours, as may be &s;een in the 22d, 23d, and 24th ver&s;es.</P>

In &s;uch a ca&s;e he mu&s;t have recanted, ju&s;tifi|cation by faith in the merits of Chri&s;t, and al&s;o the new birth, and the doctrine of being &s;aved by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t, &amp;c. In &s;hort, he mu&s;t have re|nounced the whole Chrit&s;tian revelation. And for what? Why, to plea&s;e this &s;elf-important young man, that he might have hung his pulpit in mourning on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As for this Author's rejecting the doctrine of Chri&s;tian Perfection, and pleading for &s;ins re|maining in us as long as we live, I do not wonder at it, for was he perfect in the love of God, he would not have railed as he has done in his Ser|mon. But under the pretence of &s;in remaining in him, he has a cloke for his evil-&s;peaking, and may perhaps &s;ay with Dr. <HI>c-p,</HI> if God is angry with a believer though he &s;ins often, he would be angry without a cau&s;e.

This is wonderful indeed, that the blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth us from all, and yet we &s;in, in thought, word, and action, and the con&s;cience from guilt, &s;o then we are &s;inful, and yet the con&s;cience not defiled, and we can &s;ee &s;in in our&s;elves, and yet we are clean in the &s;ight of God! at this rate we &s;ee better than him.

<P>He &s;ays, "Ble&s;&s;ed be God we believers have no conditions to perform." Our Lord &s;aith, John xiv. 15. "If ye love me keep my commandments." Fear God and keep his commandments; a&s;k and ye &s;hall have, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find, knock and it &s;hall be opened, again, watch and pray, and pray always; and pray without cea&s;ing, "If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live."

I &s;hould take the Author to be an Antinomian, from the&s;e and other of his words, only he &s;ays none of them &s;hall preach in his pulpit; he &s;hould have &s;aid, none ex|cept him&s;elf.</P>

"Search and look, for in God's words, &s;uch words are not to be found, neither are they implied." What &s;ophi&s;try! what fal&s;ehood! If any per&s;on follow Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be in holine&s;s. See 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. "But as he which hath called you is holy, &s;o be ye holy in all manner of conver&s;ation." Becau&s;e it is written, Be ye holy, for I am "holy," See al&s;o Heb. xii. 14. "Follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." See Luke i. 75. and a Cor. vii. 1. and 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 7. But if this man is per&s;uaded that <HI>all holine&s;s</HI> is not meant in the&s;e texts, but only &s;ome holine&s;s, let him beware how he joins together what God has put a&s;under, I mean, &s;in and holine&s;s: for the character of our Lord's &s;heep is, that they follow him, and will not follow a &s;tranger, &s;ee John x. 4. 5. then they will not follow &s;in, which is quite a &s;tranger to our Lord.</P>
<P>He charges Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> with &s;aying, "One who is purcha&s;ed by the blood of Chri&s;t may go to hell." "He who is a child of God to-day, may be a child of the devil to-morrow."

"Hold that fa&s;t which thou ha&s;t, that no man take thy crown." Rev. iii. 12, See ii. 10. and 1 Pet. v.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. and 2 Tim. iv. 8. We are al&s;o told, Matt. x. 22. "He that endureth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved." St. John &s;aith, 1 Epi&s;tle iii. 8. "He that committeth &s;in, is of the devil," then he at that time cannot be of God. And St. Paul in the 5th of his Epi&s;tle to the Galatians, mentions &s;eventeen &s;orts of &s;ins, and &s;ays, ver&s;e 21, "that they which do &s;uch things, &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God." It there|fore remains for this Author to prove that no child of God can commit &s;uch &s;ins, which if they do, either wilfully or willingly, let them here read what the Scriptures &s;aith in this ca&s;e. And as the Author in his 32d page &s;ays. "There is great room to believe from Scripture, that every fal&s;e prophet, &amp;c. is eternally lo&s;t," &s;o we have room to &s;ay from the Scripture al&s;o, that every per&s;on who committeth &s;in is of the devil.</P>
<P>Page 33. The Author &s;ays of the per&s;ons who turn from Arminian doctrines, &amp;c. "They grow in knowledge as well as in grace, they grow &s;ick of Arminian doctrines, they grow in love to Cal|vini&s;t doctrines, that is to the doctrines of the Bible: they grow out of conceit with perfection, and they grow up to a knowledge of that per|fection which is in Chri&s;t." Therefore it is, that I have more hope of &s;ome, who are among the Ar|minians, than I have for their decea&s;ed fal&s;e teacher; becau&s;e in the cour&s;e of &s;o many years, he never grew better," but rather grew wor&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="139">
This is excellent doctrine: they grow in know|ledge as well as in grace, and in love to Calvini&s;t doctrines, the doctrines of the Bible, 1. They know that God has ab&s;olutely decreed that a few, called the elect, &s;hall be &s;aved, and that the far greater part of mankind &s;hall be infallibly damned, which neither the one nor the other can evade or re&s;i&s;t: but the Bible &s;avs. Ezek. xxxiii. 11.

They know that Chri&s;t died but for a few, the elect; the Bible &s;ays, Heb. ii. 9. "that he by the grace of God &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man." and 1 Tim. ii. 4, 5, 6. "Who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. Fer there is one God and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time." When that due time is come, it will then be te&s;tified, to the confu&s;ion of tho&s;e who now deny it: that Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all mankind. Then will he declared, according to John, 1 Epi&s;tle ii. 2. "And he is the propitiation for our &s;ins: and not for our's only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world." 3. "They know that very one mu&s;t &s;in as long as they live." But the Bible &s;avs, "He that committeth &s;in is of the devil," 1 John iii. 8. Here let every one, who committeth &s;in, or turns advocate for &s;in, <HI>fear</HI>; le&s;t while he thinks him&s;elf a child of God, he &s;hould be found a child of the devil. "for in this the children of God are manife&s;t, and the children of the devil." "Who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;|ne&s;s, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother," 10th ver&s;e. 4. They know, as this Au|thor &s;aith, "We believers have no condition to perform." The Bible &s;ays, Rev. xxii. 14, "Ble&s;|&s;ed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City." Likewi&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="140">
&s;ee our Lord's Sermon on the Mount, and other pa&s;&s;ages quoted before in the preceding pages. Yet I pre&s;ume that this Author does perform various conditions, commanded of him in the word of God, &s;uch as preaching, praying, vi&s;iting the &s;ick, &amp;c. Now, if the&s;e are done with a view to his obtaining &s;alvation through faith in Chri&s;t, then they are &s;uch conditions as are commanded, as St. Peter &s;peaks of, 2 Pet. i. 5.-10. in which he concludes, "for if ye do the&s;e things, ye &s;hall never fall." But if the&s;e are not conditions, then he that does them, does works of &s;uppe|rarogation which would &s;ound a little too Popi&s;h. 5. They grow out of all conceit with perfection. Chri&s;t &s;aid, Matt. v. 48. "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is per|fect." Surely this mu&s;t mean, perfectly free from &s;in; but it is a wonder they do not grow out of conceit with the Bible, for having &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in it. 6. They grow up to a knowledge of that perfection which is in Chri&s;t. The Bible &s;ays, 1 John ii. 3, 4. "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that &s;aith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."</P>
<P>Page 34. Here the Author thinks many will judge him. No doubt but they will; for he has &s;et them the example, in his ra&s;h and unchari|table cen&s;ures, which &s;hews, what &s;pirit he is led by, in condemning others for fal&s;e teachers, becau&s;e they hold not his opinions in all things; as if he was the only one that knew the truth, and all other per&s;ons were fal&s;e! if his cen&s;ures are not railings, I know not what are; for like the Chief Prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees, who called our Lord a deceiver, after his death, &s;o this Author has called Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> after his death; a fal&s;e prophet, in many places in his Sermon; and re|pre&s;ented him, as one who laid in wait to de|ceive: thus the Author has trod in the &s;teps of the Chief Prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees, and our Lord's
<PB N="134" REF="141">
words are here fulfilled, the Di&s;ciple is not greater than his Lord, and as our Lord was called Beelzebub, &s;o have they called his &s;ervant a fal&s;e Prophet. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some may think the Author's doctrines are wrong as well as his &s;pirit: but I hope they do not judge or condemn him becau&s;e his opinions, in various points, are different from theirs; but let each judge for him&s;elf, and let us pray for each other, that we may be led into the way of truth, and by the &s;pirit of love and holine&s;s, and not di&s;pute again&s;t the Bible, or any part of it, for that would be a &s;in, as the Author &s;ays in his 11 th page, "They who try the Spirit by the Scriptures, with a &s;ingle eye to his glory, whether Preachers or hearers, however they may be con|demned by men on earth, will be applauded by God and Chri&s;t, and all the holy angels, with, Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Here the Author gives us a copy of the joyful &s;entence which will be pa&s;&s;ed on Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and num|berle&s;s others, both Arminians, and Calvini&s;ts, who through faith in Chri&s;t, inherit the promi&s;es. There is a ble&s;&s;ed Coalition, of them in heaven, where their different opinions are &s;et right: and why &s;hould there not be a union and friendly Coalition here among Arminians and Calvini&s;ts. though the Author is again&s;t it. I do not mean in every une&s;&s;ential doctrine, but in tho&s;e which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, and which each of them is pretty well agreed in; &s;uch as, the corruption of man's nature by the fall; the impo&s;&s;ibility of our delivering our&s;elves from that corruption, and from God's ju&s;t judgment, by any thing we can do; that no man can be &s;aved, but by the merits of Chri&s;t, who is the Author of our &s;alvation, and that no man can be ju&s;tified by any thing he can do, but only in, and through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, received by faith, which faith is the gift of God, as St. Paul &s;aith, Eph. ii. 8, 9. &s;uch Chri&s;tians are al&s;o agreed,
<PB N="135" REF="142">
that of nece&s;&s;ity, every man that is &s;aved mu&s;t ex|perience the new birth, being born again of the Spirit of God, or they cannot enter into the king|dom of heaven, they are al&s;o agreed, that every man mu&s;t be &s;anctified by the wa&s;hing of re|generation and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t: and that none but tho&s;e who are ju&s;tified through Chri&s;t, and &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t, are allowed, to be the elect of God: to this all &s;ound Calvini&s;ts, and Arminians agree, though they differ from each other in the account they give of the method and manner of God's dealings with the elect, and the reprobate, yet they all come to this point; that all tho&s;e who are &s;aved, are &s;aved by the grace of God, in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and all who are not thus &s;aved mu&s;t peri&s;h. And is it not a pity that the&s;e Chri&s;tians &s;hould not give each other the right hand of fellow&s;hip, and go on in their Ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s according to the light God has imparted to them; and thus join together to the pulling down the kingdom of &s;in and Satan, and building up the kingdom of God, and his Chri&s;t, in the hearts of &s;inners, as the Lord &s;hall enable them; and then if it &s;hould plea&s;e God, that &s;ome who are convinced of &s;in, &amp;c. under an Arminian Preacher, and receive a deliverance under a Calvini&s;t Preacher, or are unawakened under a Calvini&s;t: and comforted under an Ar|minian, let neither boa&s;t, but &s;ay it is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes, which &s;hews God's approbation of both, and that he worketh by whom he will, and in what manner his wi&s;dom &s;eeth meet. To conclude, Let us fol|low peace with all men, and let brotherly love continue, bearing with, and forbearing each other in love. And let each Preacher &s;ay, with re&s;pect to others, &s;ay that God has &s;ent him to preach the Go&s;pel, and not to hinder and vilify others from doing the &s;ame, and then in the end, each will receive the joyful welcome of entering into the joy of his Lord, which will be the happy por|tion of all that love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Amen.</P>
