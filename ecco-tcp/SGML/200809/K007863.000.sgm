<HEAD>THE ROYAL VISION.</HEAD>
<L>THE mighty God of armies bows his ear</L>
<L>To wailing mankind's moan,</L>
<L>The Lord of Ho&s;ts from heav'n looks down,</L>
<L>No more with awful eye &s;evere;</L>
<L>He hears the bleeding nations groan,</L>
<L>He &s;ees the vanqui&s;h'd fall, the victor frown;</L>
<L>He turns a&s;ide his face</L>
<L>By pity touch'd and godlike grace:</L>
<L>He calls BRITANNIA's guardian angel loud,</L>
<L>Go, quell the &s;anguine, and a&s;&s;uage the proud:</L>
<L>Thy glorious lot on yonder orb below</L>
<L>That globe &s;hall rule, my laurel there &s;hall grow;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="014920250000040">Arre&s;t the rapid bolt, beat down the mortal &s;teel,</L>
<L>For man laid wa&s;te my tender mercies feel.</L>
<L>He &s;aid, and pointed to the ble&s;s'd around</L>
<L>The ga&s;ping &s;oldier, and the gu&s;hing wound,</L>
<L>With human nature fainting on the ground.</L>
<L>The ble&s;s'd them&s;elves &s;eem'd &s;ad that &s;pace,</L>
<L>And begg'd that mankind might have peace.</L>
<L>Go forth, my &s;trength, thy mighty wings out&s;pread,</L>
<L>Yon crim&s;on guilty banners tread,</L>
<L>Beneath the foot of peace, he &s;aid;</L>
<L>And &s;heath, oh! &s;heath the murd'rous &s;word;</L>
<L>This olive from thy radiant wing</L>
<L>(That near my mercy-&s;eat &s;till grows)</L>
<L>In GEORGE's brea&s;t make joyful &s;pring,</L>
<L>And with it wa&s;t my world creating word:</L>
<L>Let famine, pe&s;tilence and &s;laughter cea&s;e,</L>

<L>In hideous groupes by form creating art;</L>
<L>With all the barb'rous mi&s;chiefs that deface</L>
<L>The works of God, &s;ince CAIN his brother &s;lew,</L>
<L>He placed before his vi&s;ionary view:</L>
<L>The infant &s;prawling on the &s;oldier's &s;pear,</L>
<L>Or clinging to the murther'd mother's brea&s;t,</L>
