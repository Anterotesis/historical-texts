He hath lived with the fir&s;t wits of the pre&s;ent age in great credit, and upon a footing of much intima|cy and kindne&s;s. He is well known to have been the particular friend of the Dean of St. Patrick's, and at this moment corre&s;ponds with the Earl of Che&s;terfield, who&s;e letters will be publi&s;hed by him immediate|ly after the demi&s;e of &s;aid Earl. He was &s;ent to Newgate by the Hou&s;e of Commons in the year 1738, for his &s;teadine&s;s in prevarica|ting in the cau&s;e of liberty; and &s;worn an alderman of Dublin in the year 1770: fined for not ferving the office of &s;heriff in the year 1768. His Journal (to which he hath lately added a fourth column) is circu|lated all over Europe, and taken in at the coffee-hou&s;es in Con&s;tantino|ple, be&s;ides Bath, Bri&s;tol, Bo&s;ton, Tunbridge Wells, Brighthelm&s;tone, Virginia, and Eyre-Connaught. In his paragraphs he hath always &s;tu|died the pro&s;perity and honour of his native country, by &s;trenuo&s;ly decrying of whi&s;key, projecting cellars, holes made by digging for gra|vel in the high roads, voiding of excrements in the public &s;treets, throwing of &s;quibs, crackers, &s;ky-rockets, and bonfires; by which ma|ny lives are lo&s;t, men, women, and children maimed; &s;ick per&s;ons di|&s;turbed out of their &s;leep; eyes burned out, and hor&s;es &s;tartled; re|commeding it to Archbi&s;hops, Dukes, Lords, Privy Coun&s;ellors, Gene|rals, Colonels, Field Officers, and Captains, to fall down precipices, tumble into cellars, be overturned by rubbi&s;h thrown in the &s;treets, in order to remove nui&s;ances; di&s;&s;uading all bloods, bucks, &s;marts, rappa|rees, and other &s;uch infernal night-walkers, from committing man|&s;laughter upon pigs, hackney hor&s;es, watchmen's lanterns, and other enormities; prophane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, and breaking the Sabbath, and the commandments; exclaiming again&s;t the importation of potatoes, and advi&s;ing to grow more corn; inciting to virue by characters in his Journal, and calling upon the magi&s;trates to do their duty.&mdash;The Earl of Che&s;terfield compareth him unto Atticus a Roman Baronet, and &s;un|dry other compliments.&mdash;<HI>N.

He expo&s;ed Alderman Faulkner, under the character of Peter Paragraph, in one of his pieces, acted upon Smock-alley &s;tage in Dublin. He was pro|&s;ecuted for &s;aid offence by Mr. Faulkner, and tried before Mr. Ju&s;tice Robin&s;on, who inveighed very eloquently again&s;t &s;tage-players, and &s;aid he might be con&s;idered as rubbi&s;h or a dunghill, and brought under the head of nui&s;ances.&mdash;The learned council for the pro&s;ecutor, al&s;o compared him unto Ari&s;tophanes, and the alderman unto Socrates; adding al&s;o, that Socrates was not the wor&s;e for the compari&s;on. The play-hou&s;e would have run with blood on this occa&s;ion, and many &s;words would have been drawn, had not Mr. Faulkner prevailed on his friends (who were pre&s;ent every night of the repre&s;entation) to hear the piece out, and let him take his remedy by law; to which they ve|ry obligingly con&s;ented.&mdash;<HI>N.

But I am informed that the Lord Bacon, Baron Ve|rulam, Vi&s;count St. Albins, and Plutarch, have been more indu&s;triou|in this way than any of their contemporaries, the moderns. Howard, in imitation of the&s;e &s;upernatural wits, is al&s;o the author of a compi|lation of an octavo volume, under the title of Howard's Apothegms, collected from Bacon, Plutarch, Sir John Fielding, Julius Cae&s;ar, The Wit's Vade Mecum, Solon, a Chri&s;tmas Box for Young Ladies, Tay|lor's Holy Living and Dying, and the Buck's Companion.</NOTE></L>

<P>I have at length &s;een what I have long wi&s;ted to &s;ee, this wonderous lake; to attempt to de&s;cribe it would require the able&s;t pen of the an|tient poets, or, of modern poets, the famous painter of &s;aid lake, wherefore, I &s;hall never attempt it:&mdash;yet, notwith&s;tanding all the beau|ties of the lake, I cannot think it, as a curio&s;ity, equal to the Giant's Cau&s;eway; I have &s;een both, I never &s;aw any thing LIKE the fir&s;t, nor any thing EQUAL to the latter; this di&s;tinction is agreed to by all I have mentioned it to. But alas! this lake has been the death of a man, for whom the whole province here is in tears, the late bi&s;hop of Lime|rick, Dr. Averel, our countryman:&mdash;To &s;um up all &s;hortly as I can, I heard the people of Limerick, (where I was &s;hortly after his death) &s;ay, that there has not been &s;uch a bi&s;hop &s;ince the time of the apo|ftles; that the Romi&s;h clergy &s;aid, they &s;hould not wonder, had he lived any time, if they had lo&s;t many of their flocks.&mdash;What obligations then are due to our Lord Lieutenant, for having appointed &s;uch a man their pa&s;tor, for though Heaven has plea&s;ed to take him away, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or will hear &s;o much of him, that he cannot but endeavour to imitate him? I heard this acknowledged by &s;everal, as al&s;o for his concurrence in appointing that well known friend to his country, and their city, e&s;pecially, &s;peaker: from the&s;e and many other like in&s;tances of his impartial conduct, it is wi&s;hed that we may never lo&s;e him;&mdash;and eve|ry day the advantage of a re&s;ident Vice-Roy becomes more and more manife&s;t; that from this new mods of government, there is far more likelihood that merit will be rewarded, proper per&s;ons appointed to of|fices, and the laws supported and executed. A gentleman of your city happening to be at Limerick, &s;hortly after the interment of the bi&s;hop, and hearing the prodigious great character of him from all per&s;ons, wrote the following lines, extempore, as an in&s;cription for a monument.</P>

He publi&s;hed a famous Novel, called, The Fool of Quality, which is &s;old in &s;eparate volumes, or together, at my &s;hop in Parliament-&s;treet.

The Earl of Che&s;terfield, as a proof of his e&s;teem for his fine talents, made him a barrack-ma&s;ter.

Mr. Kavanagh is of opinion, that it alludeth unto the political di&s;put es which raged in the year fifty|three; in which the Doctor may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have wrote madri|gals, to appea&s;e the minds of the people. My nephew Todd in|clineth to believe, that &s;omething is intended which he can't di&s;cover. For my own part, I opine; that it only refereth to the age of the lady, who had attained her fifty-third year. It certainly is not very gen|teel to ridicule this pa&s;&s;ion, which is properly called all-powerful, to &s;hew that it &s;pareth neither age nor condition, &s;tation nor dignity; not to mention the example of Anacreon, who was choaked with a grape|&s;tone, drinking the health of his mi&s;tre&s;s, at the age of four-&s;core: I am my&s;elf this in&s;tant a captive to the charms of a lady who has pa&s;&s;ed her grand climacteric, and have addre&s;&s;ed many &s;onnets to her, in a &s;tyle no le&s;s tender than the Doctor's, one of which, the mo&s;t admired by my friends, I have &s;elected, and venture to publi&s;h, as a proof of my pa&s;|&s;ion, and a &s;pecimen of my poetical endowments.</P>

It will not, I hope, be con&s;idered as pre&s;umption, that I add the authority of my Journal, which is con&s;idered as a &s;tandard of our language; where|as I have always con&s;ulted the particular propriety of diction, and may be bold to challenge any author now extant, for &s;uch a variety of tracts, written in &s;o unblemi&s;hed a purity, without any abbreviations of termi|nations, and abounding in the be&s;t cho&s;en epithets.</NOTE></L>
