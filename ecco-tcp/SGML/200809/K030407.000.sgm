<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of a Dramatic piece on the Stage, depends, &s;ays Voltaire, upon accidental circum&s;tan|ces, but the day of publication decides its fate.</P>
<P>Per&s;uaded of the truth of this remark, the Author of the Tragedy of Alfred would have &s;ubmitted his performance, to the final judgment of the Reader, without preface or apology, if he had not been ad|vi&s;ed, and indeed urged, to make a reply to &s;ome ho&s;tile critici&s;ms, which appear to have been founded upon prejudice and opinion, rather than rea&s;on and argument.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that the character of Al|fred, in the Tragedy, does not agree with the cha|racter of Alfred in Hi&s;tory: "That the Hero, the Legi&s;lator, is degraded to a Lover, who enters the Dani&s;h camp, from a private, not a public, mo|tive, and acts the part of an impo&s;tor."</P>
<P>In Tragedy, if the &s;ubject be Hi&s;torical, an au|thor is not permitted to introduce events, contrary
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
to the great e&s;tabli&s;hed facts of Hi&s;tory; for in|&s;tance, in the Tragedy of Alfred, the Hero mu&s;t not be killed, nor driven out of England by the Danes; but pre&s;erving tho&s;e ancient foundations, as the piers of his bridge, the Author may bend his arches, and fini&s;h the fabrick, according to his ta&s;te and fancy, for the poet is at liberty, and it is the e&s;|&s;ence of his art, to invent &s;uch intermediate circum|&s;tances, and incidents, as he thinks will produce the mo&s;t affecting &s;ituations. In this department, the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing, but pro|bability and con&s;i&s;tence of character, the barriers of dramatic truth. Let us apply this principle to the point in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Alfred was a young man, when he fought the battle of Ethendune. The victory, which gave him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom, mu&s;t have been gained before he begun to model the &s;tate, Is it im|probable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a young hero was in love? Is it incon&s;i&s;tent to repre&s;ent the per&s;on, who was a Legi&s;lator when advanced in years, as a lover in his youth! Does it degrade the character of a hero to &s;uppo&s;e, that he was in love with the prince&s;s whom he afterwards married? Is it not rather in|jurious to his heroi&s;m to conclude, that he cho&s;e a con&s;ort whom he did not love? If this rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, there will be no difficulty in vindicating the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of the hero. The dramatic and the real Alfred, are both involved in the charge of impo&s;ture; both entered the Dani&s;h camp in di&s;|gui&s;e; the previous events, as narrated in the tra|gedy, are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e mentioned in hi&s;tory. Alfred, for almo&s;t two years, had wan|dered thro' England, concealing him&s;elf under feign|ed names and characters. He lived in the mid&s;t of his enemies, by being &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead. Emerg|ing from this ob&s;curity, he appears in the tragedy, and is informed of the alarming ambiguous &s;ituation of Ethel&s;wida; his u&s;ual &s;tratagems pre&s;ent them|&s;elves, one would think, naturally to his mind, ex|tremely
<PB N="v" REF="4">
agitated, and prone both by temper and habit, to the mo&s;t daring and romantic enterprizes. He re&s;olves to enter the Dani&s;h camp, to learn the fate of Ethel&s;wida, and ob&s;erve the &s;trength and or|der of the enemy's army, before he ventures a deci|&s;ive engagement.</P>
<P>The continued artifice is inevitable. The con|duct of Alfred, in the camp of Hinguar; the man|ner in which he deceives the Dane, is extremely &s;imilar to the conduct of Ore&s;tes in the Electra of Sophocles, which no critic hitherto has blamed. Ore&s;tes enters the palace of Aegi&s;thus, as the me&s;|&s;enger of his own death, carrying an urn, which contains (he &s;ays) the a&s;hes of Ore&s;tes, who&s;e un|timely fate he mo&s;t circum&s;tantially relates. The Grecian hero practi&s;es the deceit with an intention to kill the per&s;ons whom he deceives. The Engli&s;h hero deceives Hinguar only to gain acce&s;s to Ethel&s;|wida, without meaning to hurt the per&s;on of his enemy. To prai&s;e Sophocles, and blame the author of Alfred, for the &s;ame conduct, &s;eems a direct contradiction, which can only be accounted for, in one way; an imaginary idea has been formed of the character of Alfred as an old mortified, a&s;cetic &s;age, of &s;pirit too &s;ublime and aetherial to de&s;cend to hu|man pa&s;&s;ions or human actions. But the real as well as the dramatic Alfred was a young hero, a bard, a winner of battles, brave and magnanimous, but compelled by the pre&s;&s;ure of tho&s;e de&s;perate times, in which he lived, to practi&s;e a thou&s;and arts to exi&s;t by &s;imulation and di&s;&s;imulation. Whoever recollects and weighs the&s;e circum&s;tances, will it is pre&s;umed readily pardon the artifice of Alfred, in the Tragedy, and acknowledge that the <HI>feigned</HI> in|cidents of the piece are altogether con&s;i&s;tent with the true. If not, the author mu&s;t be contented to la|bour under the imputation of an erroneous judgment, for he meant nothing le&s;s than to degrade the cha|racter of Alfred; on the contrary, finding in the
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
records of a remote and barbarous age, a hero of great renown, but from the defect of his hi&s;torians, involved in clouds and darkne&s;s:
<Q>Qui caput inter nubila condit.</Q>
he was tempted to &s;eize his name, and di&s;play his character in new &s;ituations, connected with the old and well known events of his life and fortune. The play is printed as it was performed. An alter|ation has been made, in one &s;cene, and &s;ent to the Theatre, which, if the Tragedy &s;hould be re&s;umed or revived, may perhaps contribute to heighten its effect.</P>

<L>Here, in his heart,</L>

<L>To die in battle is a warrior's death.</L>
<L>The hero fights and falls; but never yields.</L>
<L>Hinguar has fought. From &s;ea to &s;ea, his &s;word,</L>
<L>Thro' England blaz'd, a meteor dropping blood.</L>
<L>The wolf and eagle followed to the fea&s;t,</L>
<L>Tracking its cour&s;e. The warrior, old in arms.</L>

<L>No. Ethel&s;wida fell</L>
<L>By Ronex. Yet, altho' I killed her not,</L>
<L>Her death delights me. Saxon, I rejoice</L>
