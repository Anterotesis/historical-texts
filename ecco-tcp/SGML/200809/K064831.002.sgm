This publication, though certainly not without the merit of utility, cannot, on many accounts, be &s;aid to entitle Mr. Macfarlan to fir&s;t-rate di&s;tinction as an Hi&s;torian. We believe this gentleman formerly attempted a Tran&s;lation of O&s;&s;ian's Poems into Latin Hexameters, of which he publi&s;hed the fir&s;t book of "Temora," by way of &s;pecimen, in 1796. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the characteri&s;tic genius and &s;tyle of O&s;&s;ian, as well as with tho&s;e of the Roman cla&s;&s;ics, will wonder at &s;uch an undertaking. The &s;pecimen, produced upon this occa&s;ion, was a very indifferent one.</P>

<HEAD>MACKENZIE, HENRY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>A native of Scotland, and a gentleman, who&s;e elegance as a writer have ju&s;tly entitled him to the name of the Addi&s;on of the North. The fir&s;t cha|racter which he a&s;&s;umed as an author, was that of a &s;entimental and pathetic writer, in which he met with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. "The Man of Feeling," a novel, his fir&s;t publication, made its appearance in 1771, and was very favourably received. In the &s;ame year he publi&s;hed, "The Pur&s;uits of Happi|ne&s;s," a poem; and two years afterward, "The Man of the World," a novel, in two duodecimo volumes. The Novel of Julia de Rubign&egrave;, in two volumes, duodecimo, is al&s;o, we believe, to be at|tributed to his pen. In the dramatic line of com|po&s;ition, he has produced the Prince of Tunis, a tragedy, acted at Edinburgh, in 1773, and, we be|lieve he altered the Fatal Curio&s;ity of Lillo, as it was repre&s;ented at the Hay Market Theatre. Mr. Mackenzie edited, in 1793, a quarto volume of "Poems by the late Rev. Dr. Thomas Blacklock, together, with an E&s;&s;ay on the Education of the Blind," to which he prefixed a mo&s;t intere&s;ting and elegant Account of the Author's Life and Writings. He announced, at the &s;ame time, the intended pub|lication of &s;ome Sermons and other pro&s;e works, by Dr. Blacklock, which, we belive, have not yet
<PB N="7" REF="8">
appeared. In the year 1779, when a &s;ociety of li|terary gentlemen at Edinburgh, came to the re&s;o|lution of publi&s;hing a Periodical Paper, Mr. Mac|kenzie, then of the Exchequer in that City, was entru&s;ted with the conduct of the work. His nu|merous Papers in the Mirror, the fir&s;t production of that Society, have been particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for their elegance and neatne&s;s. To the Lounger, a periodical paper, afterward publi&s;hed by the &s;ame Society, he likewi&s;e contributed &s;ome very di&s;tingui&s;hed E&s;&s;ays. Indeed, we are of opinion, that without the attraction of Mr. Mackenzie's per|formances, neither of the&s;e publications would have ranked very highly in the cla&s;s of Periodical Pa|pers. But po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e, they may boa&s;t a &s;aving principle, and a &s;terling excellence in their conformation, which gives them a durable value and will in&s;ure them a la&s;ting e&s;timation among the works of ta&s;te.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is a &s;entence which was pa&s;&s;ed upon Mr. Macken|zie, by a reviewer of the day, upon the appearance of his Man of Feeling.</P><P><Q>It is probably a fir&s;t work; and from the &s;pecimen it affords of the talents of its author, we &s;hould not be di&s;po&s;ed to think that he will ever attain to any great eminence in literature. He may amu&s;e him|&s;elf at the foot of Parna&s;&s;us; but to a&s;cend the &s;teeps of the moun|tain mu&s;t be the ta&s;k of tho&s;e, on whom their benignant &s;tars have be&s;towed the rare gifts of true genius.</Q>!!</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>MACKENZIE, RODERICK, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>An Officer, of a character no le&s;s honourable in the literary than in the military world. He pub|li&s;hed, in 1787, Strictures on Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton's Hi&s;tory of the Campaigns in North Ame|rica, in 1780 and 1781. Mr. Mackenzie was per&s;on|ally concerned, as well as Col. Tarleton, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable actions of the&s;e campaigns, and he animadverts with the greate&s;t &s;everity upon the Colonel's "Hi&s;tory." His publication &s;eems to have been undertaken from a motive of great genero&s;ity and friendly zeal, viz. to vindicate the fame of Lord Cornwallis, who&s;e military conduct had &s;uffered certain di&s;repectful in&s;inuations from Colonel Tarleton, and who&s;e di&s;tance from home deprived him of an opportunity of defending him|&s;elf. Mr. Mackenzie has, &s;ince that time, pub|li&s;hed a "Sketch of the War with Tippoo Sul|taun," in two quarto volumes, which were printed at Calcutta, in 1793 and 1794. This work con|tains much excellent and circum&s;tantial information, related in a &s;train of impartiality, and in an hone&s;t una&s;&s;uming manner, which cannot fail to gratify every reader.</P>

We believe Mr. Mack|into&s;h is al&s;o the author of two octavo volumes of Travels in Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, publi&s;hed ano|nimou&s;ly in 1782. They con&s;i&s;t of a &s;eries of fa|miliar well-written Letters, abounding in Ori|ental Politics, and are particularly &s;evere upon Go|vernor Ha&s;tings.

<HEAD>MACKNIGHT, REV. JAMES, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>An eminent Clergyman of the Church of Scot|land, who is celebrated for his learned and u&s;eful labours in illu&s;tration and defence of the New Te&s;|tament. He publi&s;hed, in 1755, his celebrated "Harmony of the four Go&s;pels," in a quarto vo|lume; and, in 1764, "The Truth of the Go&s;pel Hi&s;tory &s;hewed," in a quarto volume. Both of the&s;e works have experienced the &s;ucce&s;s to which &s;uch laborious and ma&s;terly performances are entitled. In 1786, Dr. Macknight publi&s;hed, in quarto, "A new literal Tran&s;lation, from the original Greek, of the Apo&s;tle Paul's fir&s;t and &s;econd Epi&s;tles to the The&s;&s;alonians," which was intended as a &s;pe|cimen of a literal Tran&s;lation of all the Apo&s;tolic Epi&s;tles, with Commentaries, Notes, and E&s;&s;ays, about which he had for many years been employed. This complete work did not make its appearance till 1795, when it was publi&s;hed, in four volumes, quarto, and added a new laurel to the brow of this, re&s;pectable veteran in biblical literature.</P>

<HEAD>MACLAINE, REV. ARCHIBALD, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>A native of Scotland, and late Mini&s;ter of the Engli&s;h Church at the Hague. He publi&s;hed, &s;o long ago as the year 1752, a &s;ingle Sermon on the Death of the Prince of Orange. In 1765, his ma&s;terly Tran&s;lation of Mo&s;heim's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory made its fir&s;t appearance, in two volumes, quarto. It experienced a mo&s;t favourable recep|tion, and was &s;oon reprinted, in &s;ix volumes, octavo, which is the form in which all the &s;ub&s;equent edi|tions have been publi&s;hed. A Supplement to the quarto edition, containing the corrections, additional notes and di&s;&s;ertations which had been added to the octavo edition, was publi&s;hed by Dr. Maclaine, in quarto, in 1768. Few publications, upon their fir&s;t appearance, have been more generally read than Mr. Soame Jenyns' View of the internal Evidence of Chri&s;tianity. Upon the occa&s;ion of this publication, Dr. Maclaine addre&s;&s;ed a Series of Letters to that gentleman, publi&s;hed in a duodecimo volume, in 1777. The&s;e Letters were written to &s;erve the be&s;t purpo&s;es of Chri&s;tianity, upon a due con&s;ide|ration of the di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence of Mr. Je|nyns as a writer, of the &s;ingular mixture of piety, wit, error, wi&s;dom, and paradox, exhibited in his publication, and of his defence of Chri&s;tianity, upon principles which would lead men to enthu|&s;ia&s;m,

of the Public Ledger, and has, &s;ince that time, we believe, been concerned in other New&s;papers. In 1782, he wrote a &s;en&s;ible pamphlet, entitled, "The Claims of Ireland;" but he has been chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed as a dramatic writer. His fir&s;t piece, "Retaliation," a farce, was acted at Covent Gar|den, in 1782, and received with uncommon applau&s;e. Tri&s;tram Shandy, a piece, in two acts, was favoura|bly received in the following year; and, in the years 1785 and 1786, he produced, Fa&s;hionable Levities, a comedy, and the April Fool, a farce. Mr. Macnal|ly di&s;played con&s;iderable ability in tran&s;lating from the French of M. Sedaine, the hi&s;torical Romance of <HI>Richard Coeur de Lion.</HI> It was brought out at Drury Lane, in 1786, and greatly preferred to a piece of the &s;ame name, which had been repre|&s;ented at the other hou&s;e.</P>

<P>Of Queen Ann Street Ea&s;t. This gentleman, a native of Ireland, is the &s;on of the late Attorney General of that Kingdom, and brother to Lord Sunderlin. He boa&s;ts a very high and de&s;erved reputation in the literary world, as an Editor of Shak&s;peare, and appears to have devoted almo&s;t the whole of his time to the &s;tudy and illu&s;tra|tion of his immortal Author. Mr. Malone has written &s;everal Prologues and Epilogues, and publi&s;hed, in 1780, a very valuable Supplement, in two octavo volumes, to the edition of Shak|&s;peare's Plays, publi&s;hed, in 1778, by John&s;on and Stevens. In 1790, he produced his edition of the Plays and Poems of Shak&s;peare, in ten crown oc|tavo
<PB N="19" REF="20">
volumes, which, though inferior in &s;plendour to the elegant edition &s;ince publi&s;hed by Mr. Ste|vens, has obtained its editor mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed cre|dit for his a&s;&s;iduity and critical accumen. Two years after the appearance of this work, Mr. Ma|lone publi&s;hed a Letter to Dr. Farmer, relative to &s;ome di&s;torted facts, in a pamphlet, entitled, "Cur|&s;ory Critici&s;ms" on his edition of Shak&s;peare; and in 1796, an octavo volume, entitled, "An En|quiry into the Authenticity of certain Mi&s;cellaneous Papers, &amp;c. attributed to Shak&s;peare." The latter of the&s;e performances had the honour of giving the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the infamous forgery of the Shak&s;perian MSS. (vide Ireland) and if we extend our indulgence to &s;ome extraneous matter, and a certain &s;elf-complacent, &s;arca&s;tic a&s;perity, flowing through the volume, we cannot but pronounce it, a mo&s;t ma&s;terly piece of critici&s;m, and a very learned and entertaining book. By this work Mr. Malone made a pious offering to the Manes of his celebrated author, and gave the public a new proof of his indefatigable diligence and accuracy. Mr. Malone was one of the executors of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, and publi&s;hed his works, in two volumes, quarto, in 1797, prefixing an Account of the Life and Writings of the Author.</P>

<P>When a King a&s;ked Euclid the mathematician, whether he could not explain his art to him in a more compendious manner? he was an&s;wered, that there was no royal way to geometry.

Four years after this, he publi&s;hed by order of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Longitude, an Account of Mr. John Harri&s;on's Watch.

Two years af|terward, he publi&s;hed in a &s;mall octavo volume, an E&s;&s;ay on the Evidence External and Internal, relating to the Poems attributed to Thomas Row|ley. This performance contains a general view of the whole controver&s;y re&s;pecting tho&s;e poems, and is ju&s;tly entitled to the character of a candid and comprehen&s;ive E&s;&s;ay. We believe that Dr. Glynn, of Cambridge, gave Mr. Mathias &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this work. In the&s;e latter days Mr. Mathias has amu&s;ed him&s;elf and the public, with &s;everal &s;a|tirical pieces, which, while the times are peculi|arly in need of &s;uch effu&s;ions, do the highe&s;t honour to his wit and talents.

To his pen, we have little he&s;itation in a&s;cribing the three following excellent poetical pamphlets, viz.

The cau&s;e of literature has never been &s;upported, in a day of danger and perver|&s;ion, upon principles more excellent, or with powers better adapted to their object.

<P>Hi&s;toriographer we believe to the Ea&s;t India Com|pany, and a very learned, ingenious, and diligent Scholar. He was educated at Univer&s;ity College, Oxford, afterward became Chaplain to the 97th Regi|ment, and lived for &s;ome years at Woodford, in E&s;&s;ex. He publi&s;hed, in 1779, a quarto volume of "Poems and Mi&s;cellaneous Pieces," with a free Tran&s;lation of the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles. Mo&s;t of the&s;e poems had appeared in print before, &s;eparately; "Ne|therby," the olde&s;t of them, was publi&s;hed in 1776. They po&s;&s;e&s;s much merit, but did not obtain their author that credit which his latter writings have ac|quired him. About a year, previou&s;ly to this vo|lume, Mr. Maurice had printed a Fa&s;t Sermon, which we believe is his only publication in the cla&s;s of divinity. In 1782, he wrote <HI>Ierne Rediviva,</HI> an
<PB N="35" REF="36">
ode, in&s;cribed to the Volunteers of Ireland; and, two years afterward, "We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey," an elegiac poem, both of which pieces increa&s;ed his reputation as a poet. In 1789, Mr. Maurice pub|li&s;hed Panthea, a tragedy, from a &s;tory in Xeno|phon, which did not add greatly to his fame; and relinqui&s;hing here the line of author&s;hip, which he had hitherto traced, he has &s;ince acquired the greate&s;t eminence and di&s;tinction, in another track. This is a circum&s;tance which cannot but appear &s;urpri&s;ing; for what reader, with all his approba|tion of Mr. Maurice's abilities as an hi&s;torian, can help yielding the palm to his poetical talents? In the year 1790, he publi&s;hed a Letter addre&s;&s;ed to the Directors of the Ea&s;t India Company, contain|ing propo&s;als for printing a Hi&s;tory of the Revolu|tions of the Empire of Hindo&s;tan, from the earlie&s;t Ages; and has, &s;ince that time, publi&s;hed "Indian Antiquities," in &s;ix volumes, octavo (the two fir&s;t of which appeared in 1793) and the fir&s;t volume (in quarto) of the Hi&s;tory of Hindo&s;tan, publi&s;hed in 1795.

<HEAD>MELMOTH, WILLIAM, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>This literary Veteran has been di&s;tingui&s;hed for more than fifty years, as one of the mo&s;t elegant &s;cholars and cla&s;&s;ical writers of his time. Few au|thors have contributed &s;o much to the improvement of our &s;tyle, or have exhibited, in their works, &s;uch complete models of elegant writing, &s;uch &s;pecimens of correct choice and per&s;picuous arrangement of words, and of harmonious con&s;truction of periods. Mr. Melmoth is a &s;on of the late eminent Advo|cate of the &s;ame name, who wrote an admirable treati&s;e on the great importance of a Religious Life. He died in 1743, and it is &s;aid of him, 'few ever pa&s;&s;ed a more u&s;eful, none a more blamele&s;s life.' The fir&s;t publication of the &s;ubject of this article was "The Letters of Sir Thomas Fitzo&s;|borne, on &s;everal Subjects," in an octavo volume. The&s;e admired Letters made their fir&s;t appearance about the year 1742, and have experienced that favourable reception and general circulation, to which their very &s;terling merit entitles them. Mr. Melrmoth's elegant Tran&s;lation of Pliny's Epi&s;tles made its fir&s;t appearance, in two octavo volumes, in 1747, about four years before the Tran&s;lation by the Earl of Orrery, to which it was ju&s;tly preferred. In 1753, he publi&s;hed, in three octavo volumes, a Tran|&s;lation of Cicero's Letters to his Friends, with Re|marks
<PB N="39" REF="40">
in which the <HI>patriot character</HI> ofth a celebrated Roman is ju&s;tly que&s;tioned; and, in 1773 and 1777, Tran&s;lations of Cicero's Cato and Laelius, each in an octavo volume, with Remarks. The&s;e fini&s;hed performances have acquired Mr. Melmoth the great|e&s;t reputation po&s;&s;ible, as an elegant and accurate &s;cholar. They will probably &s;peak for him while Roman and Engli&s;h eloquence can be united. Yet, when we con&s;ider them as &s;pecimens of tran&s;lation, we cannot help thinking, that he is too often led away by the vanity of improving upon his author, that he frequently &s;acrifices his original to a fal&s;e refinement and an over&s;pun delicacy of phra&s;e, and la&s;tly, that he has too much of what the Greeks expre&s;s by the forcible term <GAP DESC="foreign">. In the year 1794, after a long repo&s;e, Mr. Melmoth was con|&s;trained to re&s;ume his pen, upon the occa&s;ion of a very unprovoked attack from Mr. Bryant, in his Treati&s;e on the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion. The grounds of this attack were Mr. Melmoth's remarks in his Tran&s;lation of Pliny's Letters, re|&s;pecting Trajan's per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians in Bythinia, and he wrote a pamphlet in An&s;wer to Mr. Bryant, in which he vindicated him&s;elf with great ability, and proved his point. Two years after this, Mr. Melmoth publi&s;hed, "Memoirs of a late eminent Advocate" (his father), in a thin octavo volume; which is a tribute of filial piety, not le&s;s elegant than merited.</P>

<P>This gentleman is a native of the Metropolis, and &s;on of a late Governor of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company. He was born in the year 1755, was educated at Harrow under the private tuition of Dr. Parr, and became, afterward, a Member of Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s College, Cambridge, and of Lincoln's Inn. Upon the death of his father he bought a com|mi&s;&s;ion in the Hor&s;e-guards, and was, for &s;everal years, Adjutant and Lieutenant to the fir&s;t troop, commanded by Lord Lothian. He afterward quit|ted this &s;ervice, and travelled, for &s;ome years, on the continent. Mr. Merry made a long &s;tay at Florence, and was elected a Member of the fa|mous Academy Della Cru&s;ca. A few years ago, he married the celebrated actre&s;s Mi&s;s Brunton, who then quitted the &s;tage. During his re&s;idence at Florence, Mr. Merry was a principal contributor to the "Florence Mi&s;cellany," which was written by a few Engli&s;h of both &s;exes, who had met by chance at Florence, and was &s;uperintended by Mrs. Piozzi. In 1787, he publi&s;hed, in London, "Pau|lina, or the Ru&s;&s;ian Daughter," a poetical tale, founded on fact; and in the year following, "Di|ver&s;ity,"
<PB N="41" REF="42">
a poem. He has al&s;o publi&s;hed "The Laurel of Liberty," a poem; "Lorenzo," a tragedy, repre&s;ented at Covent Garden; an Ode for the 14th of July, 1791, which was performed at the Crown and Anchor Tavern; "Fenelon, or the Nuns of Cambray," a &s;erious drama, altered from the French; and "The Pains of Memory," a poem, publi&s;hed in 1796. An Ode on the Recovery of his Maje&s;ty, recited by Mrs. Siddons at a Gala given by the Sub&s;cribers to Brookes' Club, as well as a comic-opera, entitled, "The Magician no Conjuror," acted four nights in the winter of 1792, are al&s;o to be attributed to his pen. On the 29th of June, 1787, Mr. Merry &s;ent a pretty little poem, entitled, the Adieu and Recall to Love, to the World, a new&s;paper of the day, with the &s;ignature Della Cru&s;ca. It was an&s;wered by a poem, enti|tled, the Pen, &s;igned Anna Matilda. The corre|&s;pondence thus begun, was from poetical &s;ym|pathy kept up, at intervals, for two years. Many new corre&s;pondents came forward, but the writers remained long unknown to the public and to one another. Time, at la&s;t, di&s;covered Della Cru&s;ca and Anna Matilda, to be Mr. Merry and Mrs. Ro|bin&s;on, who had an interview toward the conclu&s;ion of the corre&s;pondence. In the mean time the po|etry, &s;ome of which is very pretty, attracted a good deal of notice, and was reprinted, in volumes, under the title of "The Poetry of the World." It has now reached a fourth edition, in two duode|cimo
<PB N="42" REF="43">
volumes, entitled, "The Briti&s;h Album." Mr. Merry's pieces, in this collection, have the greate&s;t claim to di&s;tinction of any. His poem, "Diver&s;ity" and "Ambitions Vengeance," a tra|gic-drama, are to be found in the&s;e volumes. In &s;peaking of Mr. Merry's preten&s;ions to &s;ame, as a poet, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that he has been loudly de|cried and &s;tigmati&s;ed by an elegant &s;atiri&s;t of the pre&s;ent day, (vide William Gifford, E&s;q.) who has &s;aid of one of his pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Laurel of Liberty.</NOTE> that it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by "Downright non&s;en&s;e, Downright frigidity, and downright doggerel." We own that his fal&s;e glitter, his negligence, and his ob&s;curity are frequently highly reprehen&s;ible, yet, cannot but allow, that his preten&s;ions to poetical merit are often great and &s;triking, while the &s;pirit of liberty and benevolence which breathes through his writings &s;eems ardent and &s;incere.

His chief work, the Hi&s;tory of Greece, is a performance which does him infinite credit. To tho&s;e who are acquainted with the intricacy of many parts of Grecian Hi&s;|tory, with the extreme difficulty of collecting the &s;cattered members of it, of detecting the &s;uppo&s;i|titious and doubtful among what is related by infe|rior or later authors, and of a&s;certaining and ar|ranging the genuine; and la&s;tly, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of invention, of forming, from parts &s;o broken and di&s;per&s;ed, a harmonizing whole, he will ap|pear highly to de&s;erve the character of a learned and accurate hi&s;torian. His Hi&s;tory of Greece is not the work of a clo&s;et critic, or a monki&s;h phi|lo&s;opher; but owes its exi&s;tence to a mo&s;t compre|hen&s;ive mind and correct judgement, happily blend|ed with exten&s;ive knowledge, and an acquaintance with the modes and manners of life.

<PB N="57" REF="58">
a continuation of the above work, in merit, as well as &s;ubject. The&s;e volumes have &s;een &s;everal edi|tions &s;ince their fir&s;t publication. In 1786, Dr. Moore publi&s;hed an octavo volume of "Medical Sketches;" and, three years afterward, his cele|brated novel, entitled, "Zeluco," in two volumes, octavo. Dr. Moore accompanied the Earl of Lau|derdale to Paris, in 1792, and was pre&s;ent during the horrid ma&s;&s;acre of the 2d of September. Soon after his return to England, he publi&s;hed a Journal dur|ing his Re&s;idence in France, in two volumes, oc|tavo, which is a mo&s;t valuable and authentic work; and, in 1795, he produced a View of the Cau&s;es and Progre&s;s of the French Revolution, in two more octavo volumes. He has, &s;ince that time, written Edward, a novel, in two octavo volumes, which, like Zeluco, exhibits various views of hu|man nature, but its characters are more indige|nous to our own &s;oil. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary for us to add of &s;o popular a writer as Mr. Moore, that his works di&s;cover him to po&s;&s;e&s;s great in&s;ight into human nature, and that happy union of acute di&s;|cernment, with a lively imagination, by which he is enabled to de&s;cribe its intricacies with the greate&s;t plea&s;antry.</P>

<HEAD>MORE, HANNAH.</HEAD>
<P>Formerly a School-mi&s;tre&s;s at Bri&s;tol, and a lady ju&s;tly celebrated for her literary accompli&s;hments. The elegant &s;implicity of her poems, and the pious and virtuous &s;entiments which they inculcate, come with peculiar grace from a female pen. Her fir&s;t publication was a pa&s;toral drama, entitled, "The Search of Happine&s;s," which appeared in 1773. It was written at the age of eighteen for &s;ome female friends, who played the re&s;pective characters in private parties. Though the plot of this little piece is perfectly inartificial, the poetry which it contains does infinite credit to the powers of &s;uch early years, and it experienced a very favourable reception. In the following year, Mrs. More pub|li&s;hed the Inflexible Captive, founded on the &s;tory of Regulus, an excellent tragedy con&s;idered as a literary compo&s;ition, and which was acted one night at Bath. Sir Eldred of the Bower, and the Bleeding Rock, two beautiful legendary tales, were publi&s;hed together, in quarto, in 1776. The lat|ter is in the manner of Ovid, and the pretty fiction at the conclu&s;ion had its origin from a rock, near the author's re&s;idence in Somer&s;et&s;hire, whence a crim&s;on &s;tream flows, occa&s;ioned by the red &s;trata over which the water makes its way from the mountains.

He has, &s;ince that time, written Columbus, an hi&s;torical play; the Children in the Wood, a farce; Zorin&s;ki; the Way to get Married; and a Cure for the Heart Ache, come|dies. The fir&s;t of the&s;e pieces was publi&s;hed in 1792.

Early in life he made an attempt upon the &s;tage, and is &s;everely &s;atiri&s;ed in the Ro&s;ciad, particularly for his ill-&s;ucce&s;s in the character of Othello. As an au|thor, Mr. Murphy made his fir&s;t appearance in the Gray's-Inn Journal, a periodical paper, begun in 1752, and which was continued for two years. This paper contains many ingenious e&s;&s;ays, which are collected, in two octavo volumes, in the edition of his works, and was the origin of Mr. Murphy's acquaint|ance with Dr. John&s;on. For, being at a friend's hou&s;e in the country, and not di&s;po&s;ed to lo&s;e plea|&s;ure for bu&s;ine&s;s, he took up a French <HI>Journal Lite|raire,</HI> and tran&s;lating &s;omething he liked, &s;ent it to his book&s;eller.

The&s;e pieces were printed &s;eparately at the time of their fir&s;t appearance, and have &s;ince been collected in the edition of Mr. Murphy's works, in &s;even oc|tavo volumes, publi&s;hed in 1786. They have, many of them, con&s;iderable preten&s;ions to merit. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed are, probably, the Grecian Daughter, and Three Weeks after Marriage; which la&s;t, had been mo&s;t capriciou&s;ly condemned under its fir&s;t title, viz. "What we must All Come To." In the above-mentioned edition of his works is al&s;o to be found the Rival Si&s;ters, a tragedy, which Mr. Murphy never offered to the &s;tage; and &s;ome &s;mal|ler Poems, a few of which had been publi&s;hed &s;e|parately. Some elegant Tran&s;lations from the Eng|li&s;h, into Latin ver&s;e, which are given in this edi|tion do the highe&s;t honour to Mr. Murphy's ta|lents; among them, the tran&s;lation of Gray's Elegy is eminently beautiful. The fir&s;t &s;pecimen of his &s;kill at biographical writing was a copious and mo&s;t entertaining E&s;&s;ay on the Life and Genius of Henry Fielding, prefixed to the edition of that author's works, which was publi&s;hed in 1762. About five years afterward, he publi&s;hed in a duodecimo volume,
<PB N="73" REF="74">
a mo&s;t excellent Tran&s;lation of Marmontel's Beli&s;a|rius. Neither of the&s;e productions are to be found in the &s;even-volume edition of Mr. Murphy's works. His writings &s;ince the publication of that edition have been, "Seventeen Hundred and Ninety-one," a poem, in imitation of the thirteenth Satire of Juvenal, of which John&s;on, after giving us his noble imitations of the third and tenth Sa|tires, &s;aid he wi&s;hed <HI>this</HI> Satire al&s;o was done; an E&s;&s;ay on the Life and Genius of Dr. John&s;on, pub|li&s;hed in an octavo volume, in 1792, and prefixed to Mr. Murphy's edition of Dr. John&s;on's Works, in twelve volumes, octavo; and a Tran&s;lation of the Works of Tacitus, publi&s;hed in 1793, in four quarto volumes.</P>
<P>As the Biographer of Dr. John&s;on, we feel little he&s;itation in giving Mr. Murphy the fir&s;t place among the many who have a&s;pired to that character. His &s;hort E&s;&s;ay is the production of a writer who has duly weighed, and rightly con|ceived, that judicious uniformity of colouring, which, while it gratifies the reader's curio&s;ity, never fails to hold, in its ju&s;t light, the object which it repre&s;ents; and, while we have been di&s;gu&s;ted with the im|pertinent prattle which, by &s;ome writers, has been &s;o freely expended upon this virtuous and wi&s;e, though partial and au&s;tere character, we find, in this E&s;&s;ay, a manline&s;s and propriety of conduct, which can always keep up in our minds an intere&s;t in his behalf, without ever forfeiting the dignity of its
<PB N="74" REF="75">
object. His opinions upon the writings of his au|thor are highly judicious, and mo&s;t honourable to his critical talents, and his edition of Dr. John|&s;on's Works, clearly entitles him to the &s;ame place among the Editors of that great character, which we have given him among his biographers. As a Tran&s;lator of Tacitus, Mr. Murphy will find mo&s;t favour from tho&s;e who are mo&s;t acquainted with the peril of his &s;ituation. The celebrated Mr. Gray, in one of his Letters, declares that he found him&s;elf, after making an attempt, unequal to the ta&s;k of giving Tacitus a becoming dre&s;s in our language. A better judge than Mr. Gray of &s;uch an undertaking, will not ea&s;ily be found. We are &s;orry that we can &s;ay nothing in prai&s;e of Mr. Murphy's laborious work. The freedom of his tran&s;lation, appears to us, the leading circum&s;tance again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;s. But, when we add, that, not|with&s;tanding every licence of this kind, the Engli&s;h work he has afforded us, is far from an elegant compo&s;ition; can we &s;ay that he has kept any mea&s;ures with ju&s;tice, in the execution of his ta&s;k? The merit, however, of his original writings, will &s;uper&s;ede every unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion of an un|fortunate attempt, and gain his writings a la&s;ting di&s;tinction among the works of ta&s;te. It is &s;aid that he has been for &s;ome time engaged in writing the Life of his friend Foote. Few are &s;o equal to the ta&s;k of doing ju&s;tice to the Engli&s;h Ari&s;to|phanes.</P>

a farce, entitled, "The She-Gallant," which was afterward altered for Covent Garden Theatre, under the title of the Po&s;itive Man. His &s;econd piece was Tony Lumpkin in Town, a farce, fir&s;t acted at Dublin, and brought out at the Haymarket, in 1778. The chronological li&s;t of his numerous &s;ub|&s;equent pieces, produced at the London Theatres, is as follows, viz. the Son in Law, a farce; the Dead Alive, a farce, from a &s;tory in the Arabian Nights; the Agreeable Surpri&s;e, a farce; the Banditti, a comic opera; the Po&s;itive Man, a farce; the Ca&s;tle of Andalu&s;ia, altered from the Banditti; Lord Mayor's Day, a &s;peaking Pantomine; the Maid the Mi&s;tre&s;s, a burletta, from the Italian of La Serva Padrona; the Sham-rock, a comic opera; the Young Quaker, a comedy, one of the principal circum&s;tances in which was taken from Smollet's Count Fathom; the Birth Day, or the Prince of Arragon; the Poor Soldier, a comic opera, altered from the Sham-rock; Friar Bacon, a pantomine; Peeping Tom, a mu&s;ical farce; Fontainbleau, a comic opera; the Black&s;mith of Antwerp, a farce; a Beggar on Hor&s;eback, a dramatic proverb; Omai, a pantomine; Love in a Camp, a comic opera; the Siege of Curzola, a comic opera; the Man-Milliner, a farce; the Farmer, a farce; Tantara|rara, a farce, from the French; the Pri&s;oner at Large, a farce; a Key to the Lock, a farce; the Highland Reel, a comic romance; the Czar, a comic open; the Little Hunch-Back, a farce;

<P>This notorious character was born in 1737, at Thetford in Norfolk. His father was a &s;tay-maker, he was him&s;elf brought up to that profe&s;&s;ion, and exerci&s;ed it during his youth, at London, Dover, and Sandwich. He afterward turned Exci&s;eman and Grocer, at Lewes in Su&s;&s;ex; and, upon the occa&s;ion of an election at Shoreham, in 1771, the poets of Lewes being called upon, by the candi|date of faire&s;t preten&s;ions, to furni&s;h an election
<PB N="97" REF="98">
&s;ong, Paine entered the li&s;ts, obtained the laurel and was pre&s;ented with three guineas. This, we believe, was his fir&s;t public appearance as an au|thor. in the year following, a de&s;ign having been formed by the exci&s;e officers throughout the king|dom to apply to Parliament for a con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of their &s;alaries, he wrote <HI>their ca&s;e,</HI> in an octavo pamphlet of twenty-one pages, which was republi&s;hed in London a few years ago. Having been di&s;covered, as a grocer to deal in exci&s;eable articles, and as a grinder of &s;nuff to buy &s;muggled tobacco, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the exci&s;e in 1774, after twelve years &s;ervice. In the mean time, Paine, by his <HI>Ca&s;e of the Exci&s;emen,</HI> and by his plau&s;ibility of manner, had attracted the notice of the late Mr. George Lewis Scott, commi&s;&s;ioner of exci&s;e. This gentleman recommended him &s;trongly to the cele|brated Dr. Benjamin Franklin, as a per&s;on who could be &s;erviceable, at that time, in America; and Paine &s;et &s;ail for Penn&s;ylvania, in September, 1774, upon a letter of introduction to Governor Franklin of the Jer&s;eys. It was two years after this, that he attracted great notice by the publication of his pamphlet, entitled, "Common Sen&s;e." De|&s;igned as this production was, to ridicule and expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of monarchical Government, it proved highly palatable to the republican ta&s;te of the United States. It has been called one of tho&s;e few literary performances, which have been known to produce a great and &s;udden effect upon the &s;enti|ments
<PB N="98" REF="99">
and conduct of a nation; and, having been publi&s;hed at a very critical period, the commence|ment of the American war, &s;erved more than any thing el&s;e to induce the inhabitants of that country to an immediate declaration of independence. At the latter end of the &s;ame year (1776) he began to publi&s;h, in the Penn&s;ylvania Journal, "The Cri&s;is," a periodical e&s;&s;ay, which appeared as often, during the continuance of ho&s;tilities, as his idea of the &s;tate of affairs required. The congre&s;s, at fir&s;t, managed their European concerns by a committee for &s;ecret corre&s;pondence, but their demands for European aid becoming more urgent, the Secret Committee was converted into a Committee for Foreign Affairs. Paine, who was now becoming a celebrated character in the United States, was ap|pointed Secretary to this Committee, but being de|tected in retailing through the new&s;papers what he confidentially knew from the foreign corre&s;pond|ence, he was forced to re&s;ign that office. Soon after this, he obtained the degree of M. A. from the Univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, was cho&s;en a Member of the American Philo&s;ophical Society; and, when the Congre&s;s had rejected him as unworthy of tru&s;t, the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, which had been purged of Quakers by his pen, thought him fit for its Clerk. In 1782, he printed at Philadelphia, a Letter to the Abb&eacute; Raynal on the Affairs of North America, in which he undertook to correct and clear up the mi&s;|takes in the Abb&eacute;'s Account of the Revolution. A
<PB N="99" REF="100">
little later in the &s;ame year, and at the &s;ame place, he al&s;o printed, a Letter to the Earl of Shelburne, on his Speech in Parliament, July 10th, 1782, in which the noble Earl had &s;aid, that, <Q>When Great Bri|tain &s;hall acknowledge American Independence, the &s;un of Britain's glory is &s;et for ever.</Q> Both of the&s;e Letters were, &s;hortly afterward, reprinted in London. In the Autumn of 1786, Paine left America, with the intention of going to France, and arrived at Paris early in 1787, having left no great &s;hare of popularity behind him. His &s;tay here was &s;hort, and he reached London in the Au|tumn of the &s;ame year. Before the conclu&s;ion of 1787, he publi&s;hed a pamphlet upon the recent tran&s;actions between Great Britain and Holland, entitled, "Pro&s;pects on the Rubicon," in which he cen&s;ured the mea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h Admini&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>We come now to that period in Paine's Hi&s;tory, when his &s;peculations were to &s;hake the fabric of the public mind to its very foundation, and his writings to infu&s;e a poi&s;on among a deluded com|monalty, the effects of which, to a philo&s;opher in the &s;hade, would have been &s;carcely credible. Being relea&s;ed, in November, 1789, from a &s;ponging|hou&s;e, into which a debt, contracted by the pro|ject of erecting an Iron Bridge, had brought him; he beheld, with delight, the proceedings of that memorable year in France, and ha&s;tened to that country. Soon, however, he recro&s;&s;ed the channel,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
and, in his road to London, encountered Mr. Burke's far-famed pamphlet, which appeared a few days before the celebration of the French Revolu|tion, November 5th, 1790. A few months la|bour produced Part I. of the "Rights of Man." It was &s;ubmitted to the revi&s;al of Mr. Brand Hollis and a democratic Committee; and, after &s;ome &s;truggles, between the de&s;ires of the author and the wi&s;hes of his patrons, was committed by them to the pre&s;s. In February 1791, it was printed for John&s;on, in St. Paul's Church Yard, but his re|gard for <HI>the credit of his &s;hop,</HI> induced him to de|cline the &s;ale, and a delay of a month in the pub|lication thus took place. A few copies were, how|ever, &s;muggled into private hands, and, at length, on the 13th of March, 1791, it was publi&s;hed by Jordan, in Fleet Street, with a Dedication to Ge|neral Wa&s;hington. The apprehen&s;ions of Paine, upon this occa&s;ion, &s;eem to have been very great. Always ready to take wing for France, he fluttered with anxiety about the Metropolis. At length, finding that the Mini&s;try, tru&s;ting to the good &s;en&s;e of the people, gave it&s;elf no concern about him, he took a lodging in Fetter Lane, (where he re|mained till his final departure) and immediately went to work at Part II. of the "Rights of Man." This was publi&s;hed by Jordan, early in 1792. It is well known that the Jacobin Societies took the utmo&s;t pains to di&s;tribute cheap editions of this work, over the whole nation, particularly in ma|nufactories,
<PB N="101" REF="102">
and among the labouring poor. It is even &s;aid, that tobacco, grocery, and &s;weet-meats for children, were frequently &s;old in wrappers of its &s;heets! Many An&s;wers to the two Parts were pro|duced at the pre&s;s, and at the anniver&s;ary meeting of the Con&s;titutional Society, on the 13th of April, 1792, the Members of the&s;e Jacobin Societies were &s;tated to exceed forty thou&s;and per&s;ons! Go|vernment, at length, became alarmed. Pro&s;ecu|tions were commemced, in May, 1792, again&s;t Paine, as the author, and Jordan as the publi&s;her of "Rights of Man." The royal proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, &s;tating that &s;editious writings had been indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed for inciting di&s;content, and warning all magi&s;trates to be diligent in &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing tumult and pre&s;erving quiet. Both Hou&s;es of Parliament declared their abhorrence of writings, which had anarchy for their end, and proclaimed their unalterable re&s;olution to maintain the autho|rity of the laws. The City of London avowed her loyalty to the King, and her attachment to the con&s;titution. The other corporations followed the example of the metropolis; and the county-meet|ings joined in the general abhorrence of innovation, and in the univer&s;al determination to &s;upport the wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of policy, which had been tran&s;mitted by the wi&s;dom of their ance&s;tors. Paine was now employed in writing tho&s;e Letters for the ARGUS, which were afterward di&s;tributed from the pam|phlet-&s;hops under the title of "Paine's four Letters
<PB N="102" REF="103">
on Government." Shortly afterward, he produced a pamphlet, con&s;i&s;ting of two Letters to Lord On|&s;low, and one to Mr. Dundas; and another pam|phlet, containing, "A Letter to the Addre&s;&s;ers on the late Proclamation," the great object of which was, to procure a National Convention in contempt of the Parliament. He was, at the &s;ame time, readily adopted as a proper citizen, by a country which had recently plunged into the depths of anarchy; and, when the Jacobin Clubs were about to form a Convention at Paris of turbulent &s;pirits from every quarter of the world, &s;everal de|partments contended for the honour of being re|pre&s;ented by the celebrated Thomas Paine. Ca|lais bore away the <HI>glorious</HI> prize from all her competi|tors, and &s;he &s;ent citizen Audibert to &s;ignify his ap|pointment, and to &s;olicit his acceptance of it. He required little &s;olicitation; and quitting London on the 13th of September, 1792, was received with open arms on the following day, on the &s;hores of Calais. He was tried by a &s;pecial jury at Guildhall, and convicted as a malignant libeller; and, &s;oon afterward, his effigy and his books were burned in almo&s;t every village in England. His conviction made him an outlaw, and, having joined the Con|vention at Paris, in a declaration of war again&s;t Great Britain, he has, &s;ince that time, become a traitor. Amid the changes of Government in France, Paine did not e&s;cape notice, and when Robe&s;pierre began to gain an a&s;cendancy, he was
<PB N="103" REF="104">
&s;ent, with Anachar&s;is Cloots, to the pri&s;on at Lux|emburg. He, however, e&s;caped the Guillotine, and during his confinement, compo&s;ed his work, entitled, "The Age of Rea&s;on," Part I. of which was publi&s;hed in London, in 1794, and Part II. in the year following. This work naturally produced &s;everal An&s;wers at the pre&s;s, among which the "Apology for the Bible," by the Bi&s;hop of Lan|daff, is to be mo&s;t eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed. Paine's &s;ub&s;equent writings have been, a Di&s;&s;ertation on the fir&s;t Principles of Government; "The De|cline and Fall of the Engli&s;h Sy&s;tem of Finance;" a mo&s;t impudent Letter to General Wa&s;hington; and "Agrarian Ju&s;tice oppo&s;ed to Agrarian Law and to Agrarian Monopoly," all pamphlets.</P>
<P>The abu&s;e which has been &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon Paine, as a writer, has, perhaps, for the mo&s;t part, been the re&s;ult of a zeal who&s;e tendency is to weaken, more than to &s;upport, its cau&s;e. Let us ra|ther allow him, the qualified credit of an animated, energetic writer, who di&s;plays con&s;iderable acute|ne&s;s but who&s;e manner of thinking is rude, wicked and daring, and who&s;e language is vulgar though impre&s;&s;ive. Let us rather rejoice, that Engli&s;hmen, with their ju&s;t veneration for civil liberty and the rights of the people, were found &s;o wi&s;e and &s;ted|fa&s;t in an hour of danger, as to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e &s;orry calculators, that would per&s;uade a country, who&s;e con&s;titution has rai&s;ed her to be the envy of all the civilized world, to hazard that con&s;titution upon
<PB N="104" REF="105">
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, clum&s;ie&s;t, and &s;tale&s;t theories. Let us be thankful that the Arch-theori&s;t of the Rights of Man, of tho&s;e rights which transfer the reins from his pa&s;&s;ion to his rea&s;on, of tho&s;e rights which di&s;&s;olve ties, which confound di&s;tinctions, which de&s;troy &s;ecurity, could play upon us with his new lights upon human governments, without dazzling our rea&s;on, or impairing our eye-&s;ight. Finally let us rejoice, that when this wily and audacious Anarch dared, at la&s;t, to attack the &s;acred volume of our Reli|gion, there was found, on our bench of Bi&s;hops a learned and philo&s;ophical Prelate, conde&s;cending enough and active enough to oppo&s;e them nobly and completely, by his erudition, his clearne&s;s, and his &s;trength of argument.</P>

It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay too much in favour of this treati&s;e. The ripe&s;t &s;choolman may read it with in&s;truction and delight, while it contains amu&s;e|ment for the mo&s;t volatile fancy. It has obtained its author one di&s;tinction among others, &s;ingularly glorious, and, mo&s;t probably, unparallelled.

Thus the di&s;tingui&s;hed honours which &s;uch tran|&s;cendent characters are proud to receive after death, are conferred on Dr. Paley while alive! The &s;tyle of this work is admirably adapted to its &s;ubject, and is, perhaps, one of the be&s;t models for the imitation of youth, which can be found in our language; while the fine rea&s;oning, the pertinency of illu&s;tration, the &s;trong integrity of judgement, and the great comprehen&s;ion of mind which per|vade it, may be fit objects of its emulation, provided it duly e&s;timate the labour of thought, and application nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch acqui&s;itions, and form not, after all, too &s;anguine hopes of reaching &s;uch perfection. Some Remarks upon this work have been written by Mr. Gi&s;borne, for an account of which, we refer the reader to our memoir of

<P>Late Fellow and Tutor of Chri&s;t's College, Cambridge. This gentleman was a cotemporary at the Univer&s;ity with the celebrated mathematician, Mr. Atwood. They both took their degrees of B. A. in 1769, and to Mr. Parkin&s;on was adjudged the &s;uperiority in mathematical knowledge. The world, however, from the &s;pecimens which each of the&s;e gentlemen have given it, as writers on &s;ubjects of &s;cience, will be di&s;po&s;ed to wonder at this deci&s;ion. Dr. Parkin&s;on publi&s;hed, in 1789, in a quarto volume, a Sy&s;tem of Mechanics and Hydro&s;tatics, the &s;ub&s;tance of his lectures as a pub|lic tutor.

<HEAD>PARR, REV. SAMUEL, L.L.D.</HEAD>
<P>A mo&s;t elegant and profound Scholar, very highly celebrated for his knowledge of the Greek language. He was originally one of the under|ma&s;ters of Harrow School, and in that &s;ituation had the honour of &s;haring in the education, among others, of Mr. Richard Brin&s;ley Sheridan. Upon a vacancy in the headma&s;ter&s;hip, in 1770, Dr. Parr became a candidate for that office, and his cau&s;e was &s;o warmly, e&s;pou&s;ed by many of the boys of the &s;chool, as to occa&s;ion very turbulent proceed|ings. Proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, he retired to a village at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Harrow, and opened a
<PB N="112" REF="113">
&s;chool, to which he was followed by many of the Harrow &s;cholars. Dr. Parr was afterward ap|pointed, by the Earl of Dartmouth, to &s;uperintend the education of his elde&s;t &s;on, Lord Vi&s;count Lewi&s;ham, in con&s;equence of which he re&s;igned his &s;chool, and fixed his re&s;idence at Colche&s;ter, where he was attended by his Lord&s;hip, and one or two more pupils. At the expiration of this engage|ment, he was cho&s;en Ma&s;ter of the Free School at Norwich, which he conducted with great repu|tation, and has now been &s;ettled, for &s;ome years, in the neighbourhood of Warwick, in the occupa|tion of educating private pupils.</P>
<P>Dr. Parr's fir&s;t publications were, Sermons preached at Norwich during the American war. Of the&s;e, two appeared with his name in 1780, and a third, a Fa&s;t Sermon, under the name <HI>Phileleuthe|rus Norfolcien&s;is,</HI> in the year following. The la&s;t of the&s;e is particularly excellent. In 1786, he pub|li&s;hed a fourth Sermon, preached for the benefit of the Charity Schools in Norwich. It was in the year following this, that he publi&s;hed a new edition, in an octavo volume, of the three Books <HI>De Statu</HI> of Bellendenus, (Ma&s;ter of the Pleas to James I.) and prefixed a mo&s;t elegant Preface. Few pieces of compo&s;ition in Latin, have been more admired than this ma&s;terly preface. It was reprinted, &s;eparately, in the year following its fir&s;t publication. It con|&s;ists chiefly of a political retro&s;pect of the internal tran&s;actions of Britain, &s;ince the year 1783, and
<PB N="113" REF="114">
pre&s;ents us an animated panegyric of Lord North, Mr. Burke, and Mr. Fox, with a glowing invective again&s;t the methods employed to deprive them of the &s;hare they held in the Government of their country. The Latin, as well as the Engli&s;h &s;tyle of Dr. Parr, is always &s;trong, manly, and beautiful, but, perhaps, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, upon the whole, le&s;s of grace and elegance than of energy. In 1789, Dr. Parr publi&s;hed "Tracts by Warburton and a War|burtonian, not admitted into the Collection of their re&s;pective Works," in an octavo volume. Almo&s;t every reader will condemn the poignancy of lan|guage, which is u&s;ed in the preface to this volume, again&s;t the venerable Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, while he will confe&s;s, with plea&s;ure, that the characters of Jortin, Leland, and Warburton are amply and beautifully delineated. In the year 1792, Dr. Parr publi&s;hed an octavo pamphlet, entitled, "A Sequel to the printed Paper <HI>lately</HI> circulated in Warwick|&s;hire, by the Rev. Charles Curtis, brother of Alder|man Curtis, a Birmingham Rector, &amp;c." which reached a &s;econd edition. This was occa&s;ioned by a &s;u&s;picion, that Mr. Curtis had written certain ano|nymous Letters, which were &s;ent to the Doctor; that he had uttered certain reflections upon him, in his pulpit di&s;cour&s;es; and that he had &s;ent the <HI>printed paper,</HI> which appeared <HI>(auctior et emendatior)</HI> in an evening New&s;paper. The &s;ame year pro|duced Dr. Parr's celebrated and excellent Letter from Irenopolis to the Inhabitants of Eleutheropolis,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
which is a &s;erious addre&s;s to the di&s;&s;enters of Birm|ingham, written, in con&s;equence of a report that they intended a &s;econd commemoration of the French Revolution, and was publi&s;hed in a &s;hilling pamphlet. For an account of Dr. Parr's literary a&s;&s;ociation with the late Mr. Homer and Dr. Combe, relative to the publication of an Edition of Horace, we refer the reader to our memoir of the la&s;t-mentioned gentleman; where he will al&s;o &s;ee the occa&s;ion which produced Dr. Parr's excellent pamphlet, entitled, "Remarks on the Statement of Dr. Charles Combe, by <HI>an occa&s;ional Writer in the Briti&s;h Critic."</HI></P>
<P>It may very rea&s;onably be que&s;tioned whether the &s;ervices which Dr. Parr has done to the world have been adequate to his ability, or his knowledge. Much is to be allowed, however, for that want of lei&s;ure and opportunity which every man of letters mu&s;t feel, whole con&s;tant and nece&s;&s;ary occupation is the in&s;truction of youth. To the character of a profound &s;cholar, though the printed te&s;timonies he has afforded us may have been &s;lender, none &s;hall dare to di&s;pute his claim; and were our re|maining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Greek and Latin authors to &s;hare the fate of the celebrated Alexandrian Li|brary, we believe, that this gigantic proficient could afford us, from recollection, a very tolerable idea of Grecian and Roman literature. Of the Engli&s;h &s;tyle of Dr. Parr it has been &s;aid, that it unites the &s;trength of John&s;on with the richne&s;s of Burke.</P>

<HEAD>PERFECT, WILLIAM, ESQ. M.D.</HEAD>
<P>A Surgeon of We&s;t Malling in Kent, Member of the London Medical Society, and Provincial Grand Ma&s;ter of Ma&s;ons for the county of Kent. This gentleman was born at Oxford, in 1740, and is &s;on of the Rev. William Perfect, formerly Vicar of Ea&s;t Mailing in Kent. He is celebrated for his &s;kill in the cure of per&s;ons afflicted with in&s;anity, and for his activity as a member of the brotherhood of Free and Accepted Ma&s;ons. Dr. Perfect com|municated &s;everal articles to the Medical Mu&s;eum; among them are. "An Attempt to improve Medi|cal Progno&s;tication;" "The Ca&s;e of a Catalep&s;y;" and "The Appearances on di&s;&s;ecting a Woman who died of eating too much Cucumber." In 1778, he publi&s;hed "Methods of Cure in &s;ome particular Ca&s;es of In&s;anity," an octavo pamphlet; and, in 1781, Vol. I. (in octavo) of "Ca&s;es in Midwifery," to which Vol. II. was, &s;oon afterward, added. The la&s;t mentioned work was founded on the literary corre&s;pondence of the late learned and ingenious Dr. Colin Mackenzie, and contains the only traits of his practice which have, hitherto, been &s;ubmitted to the public eye. In 1784, Dr. Perfect publi&s;hed an Addre&s;s to the Public on the Subject of In&s;anity, notifying that he had opened hou&s;es at We&s;t Malling for the reception of in&s;ane per|&s;ons;
<PB N="130" REF="131">
and, three years afterward, he produced an octavo volume of &s;elect Ca&s;es in the different Spe|cies of In&s;anity, Lunacy, or Madne&s;s, with the Modes of Practice as adopted in the Treatment of each. Since that time, Dr. Perfect's only produc|tion, in this cla&s;s of publications, has been a pam|phlet, entitled, "A remarkable Ca&s;e of Madne&s;s, with the Diet and Medicines u&s;ed in the Cure." This remarkable ca&s;e is a boy at the age of <HI>eleven,</HI> and the cure is an additional proof of the author's &s;kill, in the treatment of confirmed mania.</P>
<P>Dr. Perfect is al&s;o a Ver&s;ifier, as well as a writer on medical &s;ubjects.

<P>A native of Scotland.

But the &s;peci|men with which Mr. Pinkerton here pre&s;ented the public, was by no means peculiarly engaging. In the year following he publi&s;hed, "Tales in Ver&s;e," in a quarto pamphlet; and al&s;o two dithyrambic Odes; which are more di&s;tingui&s;hed by har&s;hne&s;s and affected &s;ingularity, than by any &s;pecies of ex|cellence. Mr. Pinkerton's next publication was a u&s;eful E&s;&s;ay on Medals, which fir&s;t appeared, ano+nymou&s;ly, in a &s;ingle octavo volume, in 1784, and was enlarged to two volumes in the &s;econd edition. The valuable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dr. Combe and Mr, Southgate, we believe, were afforded the author upon this occa&s;ion. In 1786, Mr. Pinkerton pub|li&s;hed, "Ancient Scoti&s;h Poems, never before in
<PB N="134" REF="135">
Print," in two crown-octavo volumes; and, in the year following, a Di&s;&s;ertation on the Origin and Progre&s;s of the Scythians or Goths, in an octavo volume. His &s;ub&s;equent publications have been, an Enquiry into the Hi&s;tory of Scotland, preceeding the Reign of Malcolm III. in two octavo volumes, publi&s;hed in 1789; the fir&s;t genuine edition of Barbour's Bruce, with notes and a glo&s;&s;ary, in three volumes, duodecimo, publi&s;hed in 1790; Scoti&s;h Poems, reprinted from &s;carce editions, in three octavo volumes, publi&s;hed in 1792; <HI>Iconogra|phia Scotica</HI>; or, Portraits of illu&s;trious Per&s;ons of Scotland, with &s;hort Biographical Notices, Part I. II. III. IV; and the Hi&s;tory of Scotland from the Acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Stuart to that of Mary, with Appendixes of original Papers, in two vo|lumes, quarto, publi&s;hed in 1797. In the la&s;t of the&s;e works, Mr. Pinkerton has judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en the period of Scoti&s;h Hi&s;tory which remained in&s;u|lated between the accurate inve&s;tigation of the ear|lier age, by Sir David Dalrymple, and the elegant Hi&s;tory of the later times, by Dr. Robert&s;on.

<HEAD>PIOZZI, HESTHER LYNCH.</HEAD>
<P>A Lady of con&s;iderable notoriety in the literary world. She is the daughter of John Sali&s;bury E&s;q. formerly of Bach-y-graig, in the county of Flint, and neice to Sir Thomas Sali&s;bury, who ro&s;e to con|&s;iderable eminence as a civilian, in Doctor's Com|mons. In 1763, &s;he married the late Henry Thrale E&s;q.; a di&s;tingui&s;hed Brewer in the borough of Southwark. This excellent man, in the year fol|lowing his marriage, was introduced, by Mr. Mur|phy, to the acquaintance of Dr. Samuel John&s;on. The intimacy of that celebrated character with this family daily increa&s;ed, and he &s;oon became an almo&s;t con&s;tant inmate of their country re&s;idence at Streatham. The conduct of Mr. Thrale to Dr. John&s;on, was indeed truly prai&s;e-worthy. His family contributed, for fifteen years, to the prolong|ation and comfort of a mo&s;t valuable life, and when the benevolent ma&s;ter &s;unk into the grave, the me|mory of his kindne&s;s was acknowledged by the loving object of his regard, with the confe&s;&s;ion that with him were buried many of his hopes and plea&s;ures, that the face upon which he had looked for the la&s;t
<PB N="136" REF="137">
time, had never been turned upon him but with re&s;pect and benignity, that he obtained from him many opportunities of amu&s;ement, and turned his thoughts to him as to a refuge from misfortunes. Upon the death of Mr. Thrale, his widow finding it (as &s;he a&s;&s;erts) extremely perplexing and diffi|cult to live in the &s;ame hou&s;e with the Doctor, took advantage of a lo&s;t law-&s;uit to plead inability of pur&s;e for remaining longer in London or its vicinity, and retired to Bath, where &s;he knew he would not follow her. She continued, however, to corre|&s;pond with Dr. John&s;on, till near the time (July 1784) of her marriage to her &s;econd hu&s;band, Sig|nior Piozzi, a native of Florence, and a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter of the City of Bath; when a very warm expo&s;tulation, on the part of the Doctor, again&s;t this &s;tep, di&s;&s;olved their friend&s;hip. Soon after her union with Mr. Piozzi, &s;he travelled with him to the place of his birth, and vi&s;ited &s;everal parts of Europe before they returned to England.</P>
<P>During her re&s;idence in Florence, in 1785, chance having brought together, at that place, a few Engli&s;h of both &s;exes, particularly Mr. Merry, Mr. Par&s;ons, and Mr. Greathead, they wrote, in a&s;&s;ociation, "The Florence Mi&s;cellany," a collection of pieces in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, of which a few copies have been printed, but it has not been publi&s;hed. Some &s;pecimens of this flighty production appeared in a new&s;paper of the day, called the World, as well as in &s;everal of the magazines: the preface
<PB N="137" REF="138">
was written by Mrs. Piozzi, to whom, we believe, the conduct of the work had been committed. Se|veral other fugitive poetical pieces by Mrs. Piozzi, as, the Three Warnings, a tale imitated from La Fontaine; a Tran&s;lation of Boileau's Epi&s;tle to his Gardener, (fir&s;t printed in Mrs. Williams' Mi&s;cel|lanies); and a Prologue to the Royal Suppliants, have reached the public eye. Among the&s;e, the fir&s;t is to be particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed as a very ma&s;terly production, and it has been &s;trongly &s;u&s;|pected that Dr. John&s;on either wrote it, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the compo&s;ition of it. The former opinion, we think, from the &s;tyle of the piece, is improbable; but that it has felt his correcting hand, we have little doubt.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t regular exploit of Mrs. Piozzi in au|thor&s;hip, was made in the year 1786; when &s;he produced her crown-octavo volume of Anecdotes of Dr. John&s;on. Two years after this, &s;he pub|li&s;hed a Collection of Letters to and from Dr. John&s;on, from 1765, to 1784, in two octavo vo|lumes. Her "Anecdotes," as coming from the pen of a writer who had long &s;hared the &s;ociety and friend&s;hip of that illu&s;trious character, were peru&s;ed with great avidity; but time has di&s;&s;olved the charm. They bring us acquainted, it is true, with the dome&s;tic tran&s;actions, and introduce us to the private hours of the object held up to our view; yet, what of this, when, as admirers of the learning and moral excellence of their hero, we glow at
<PB N="138" REF="139">
almo&s;t every page with indignation, that his weak|ne&s;&s;es and his failings &s;hould be di&s;clo&s;ed to public view? There is, &s;urely, &s;omething &s;acred attached in every well-con&s;tituted mind to the memory of a character, which, be&s;ide extorting from us a tribute of admiration by its public name, has mingled its &s;o|cial intercour&s;e with our private lives, has confirmed and instructed us by its example and its precepts, and di&s;played to us, upon a nearer view, a propor|tional degree of that excellence which &s;ame had con|ceded as its due. To a mind of this make, the &s;tamp of death would enliven the impre&s;&s;ions it had re|ceived, and, creating a melancholy and awful ve|neration for the departed object of its regard, for|get its failings, amid its pious fondne&s;s for the plea&s;ing remembrance of its worth. The name of John&s;on &s;hall live while Piety, while Virtue, while Learning are regarded: yet John&s;on, after the lu&s;tre he had reflected on the name of Thrale, after the delight which his coun&s;el and his friend&s;hip had, for many years, afforded to the family, aged and infirm, was to be de&s;erted by his only &s;urviving companion and his nur&s;e a year or two before his end; and after death, to have his memory tortured and abu&s;ed by her dete&s;ted itch for &s;cribbling. More injury, we will venture to affirm, has been done to the &s;ame of John&s;on, by this lady and her late biographical helpmate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;well.</NOTE> than his mo&s;t avowed
<PB N="139" REF="140">
enemies have ever been able to effect; and if his character becomes unpopular with &s;ome of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, it is to the&s;e go&s;&s;iping friends he is indebted for the favour.</P>
<P>In 1789, Mrs Piozzi publi&s;hed, "Ob&s;ervations and Reflections made in the Cour&s;e of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany," in two oc|tavo volumes; and, in 1794, "Briti&s;h Synonymy; or, an Attempt at regulating the Choice of Words in familiar Conver&s;ation," in two octavo volumes. The former of the&s;e works is entertaining, though, in many re&s;pect, very reprehen&s;ible. To the due execution of the latter, a rare combination of ta|lents was requi&s;ite, among the lea&s;t of which may be numbered neatne&s;s of &s;tyle, acutene&s;s of per|ception, and a more than common accuracy of di&s;|crimination. This lady, on the contrary, brought to the ta&s;k a jargon, long &s;ince become proverbial for its vulgarity, an incapability of defining a &s;ingle term in the language, and ju&s;t &s;o much Latin, from a child's &s;yntax, as &s;ufficed to expo&s;e the ignorance &s;he &s;o anxiou&s;ly labours to conceal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Preface to Baviad.</NOTE></P>
<P>The general character, which we are di&s;po&s;ed to afford Mrs. Piozzi, as an author, is, that &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of re&s;pectable talents, and of an educa|tion &s;uperior to what commonly falls to the lot of the fair &s;ex; but that her vanity is &s;o con&s;pi|cuous upon every occa&s;ion, as to de&s;troy, in mo&s;t

<HEAD>POLWHELE, REV. RICHARD.</HEAD>
<P>Of Polwhele in Cornwall. A re&s;pectable di|vine, a very plea&s;ing poet, but a le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful hi&s;torian. He was born in 1760, at his above|mentioned patrimonial e&s;tate, was educated at the neighbouring grammar-&s;chool of Truro, became a member of Chri&s;t-Church College, Oxford, was admitted a &s;tudent in civil law, afterward took or|ders, and was, for ten years, curate of Kenton near Exeter. Before Mr. Polwhele left Truro-&s;chool, he wrote and publi&s;hed the Fate of Lew|ellyn, a legendary tale; the Genius of Karnbre, a poem; the Spirit of Fra&s;er to General Burgoyne, an ode; the Death of Hilda, an American tale; an Ode to Mrs. Macaulay, on her Birth-day; the Ca&s;tle of Tintadgel, an ode; and the I&s;le of Pop|lars, an ode: the two la&s;t of which were publi&s;hed among Rack's E&s;&s;ays. It is curious that the ver&s;i|fication of his fir&s;t production, "The Fate of Lewellyn," is much more melodious than that of his "Engli&s;h Orator," which is nearly the la&s;t; but the Tale was written to plea&s;e the ear only. In 1785, Mr. Polwhele publi&s;hed, anonymou&s;ly, Book I&punc; of "The Art of Eloquence," a didactic poem; and al&s;o, "Pictures from Nature, in twelve Son|nets," each quarto pamphlets. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was reprinted in the following year, under the title
<PB N="145" REF="146">
of "The Engli&s;h Orator," and three more books were afterward added. In the year 1786, Mr. Polwhele al&s;o publi&s;hed a Tran&s;lation into Engli&s;h ver&s;e, with di&s;&s;ertations and notes, of the Idyllia, Epigrams, and Fragments of Theocritus, Bion, and Mo&s;chus, with the Elegies of Tyrtaeus, in a quarto volume, which was afterward reprinted in two oc|tavos. It is &s;aid of this work that it was com|pleted in half a year: if &s;o, it does great credit to the talents of the writer, &s;ince many of the tran&s;la|tions are extremely happy, and, con&s;idered as a whole, it is, perhaps, a formidable rival of the &s;i|milar production by Mr. Fawkes. In 1789, Mr. Polwhele publi&s;hed, two octavo volumes of well-written Di&s;cour&s;es on different Subjects; and has, &s;ince that time, produced a quarto volume of "Poems," containing his "Engli&s;h Orator," his "Sonnets," and &s;ome other pieces; a &s;ingle Ser|mon, preached in 1792, at Kenton; Vol. I. of Hi&s;torical Views of Devon&s;hire, in octavo; and Vol. II. of the Hi&s;tory of Devon&s;hire, in folio. The <HI>former</HI> of the two la&s;t-mentioned works is to be completed in five volumes: it is a repo&s;itory of cu|rious notices, not interfering with the author's main undertaking: the <HI>latter</HI> of them, which is to be comprehended in three volumes, and the publi|cation of which was commenced with the &s;econd volume, in 1793. Be&s;ide the&s;e productions, Mr. Polwhele wrote the Biographical Memoirs of Mr. Rack, in Collin&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Somer&s;et, and was

<P>This gentleman was the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Mr. Gil|bert Wakefield, as tutor in Belles-Lettres and Cla&s;&s;ical Literature, at the New-College, Hackney, and has made him&s;elf appear ridiculous enough, by attempting to bring his &s;prinkling of cla&s;&s;ical knowledge, in competition with the copious waters of that celebrated and excellent &s;cholar. He pub|li&s;hed, in 1792, a duodecimo volume, entitled, "Ob&s;ervations on the miraculous Conception," &amp;c. with Remarks on Mr. Wakefield's opinion concerning Mat. xxvii. 5; and al&s;o an octavo vo|lume, entitled, "Divine Wor&s;hip founded in Na|ture, and &s;upported by Scripture Authority," with Remarks on Mr. Wakefield's arguments again&s;t Public Wor&s;hip, and &s;trictures on &s;ome parts of his Silva Critica, and Engli&s;h Ver&s;ion of the New Te&s;|tament.

<P>Greek Profe&s;&s;or in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and formerly Fellow of Trinity College. This gen|tleman is well known, not in this country only, for his very extraordinary talents, and as the be&s;t Greek &s;cholar we have. He was educated at Eton-&s;chool, took his degree of B.

Mr. Por&s;on's fir&s;t regular and avowed publication, was his celebrated volume of Letters to Mr. Archdea|con Travis, in An&s;wer to his Defence of the three Heavenly Witne&s;&s;es, i. John v. 7, which made its appearance in 1790. Of this work, the celebrated Mr. Gibbon has &s;aid, that it is the mo&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="149">
acute and accurate piece of critici&s;m which has ap|peared &s;ince the days of Bentley. The author's &s;trictures are founded in argument, enriched with learning, and enlivened with wit; and his adver|&s;ary neither de&s;erves, nor finds, any quarter at his hands. The elegant edition of the &s;even Plays of Ae&s;chylus, without notes, without the &s;cholia, and without the fragments, which was publi&s;hed by Foulis at Gla&s;gow, in 1795, in a folio volume, was clande&s;tinely printed from a text corrected by Mr. Por&s;on. That gentleman had lent his manu|&s;cript corrections and conjectures on the text of Ae&s;chylus, to a friend in Scotland, they fell into the hands of Foulis, and the above-mentioned edition was publi&s;hed without the Profe&s;&s;or's leave, or even knowledge. Mr. Por&s;on edited the Edition of Heyne's Virgil, which was printed in London; is at pre&s;ent, publi&s;hing new editions of Greek Plays, with &s;hort commentaries, by &s;ingle plays, each in an octavo volume, &s;ome of which have already made their appearance; and will &s;hortly (we believe produce a new Edition of Ae&s;chylus complete, with Notes. He has al&s;o been, for &s;ome time, pre|paring for the Cambridge pre&s;s, an Edition of the in|edited Greek Lexicon of Photius, from the manu|&s;cript in Trinity College Library. A mo&s;t elegant and ma&s;terly copy of this work, which his Hercu|lean talents and exqui&s;ite Greek hand-writing had produced, was, not long ago, con&s;umed by an acci|dental fire, in a hou&s;e where it was depo&s;ited. He

has again, however, a&s;&s;ailed the mighty undertaking, and will, probably, &s;oon favour the world with the truly de&s;irable fruit of his indu&s;try.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s for us to add our eulogium to the well known merit of Mr. Por&s;on, as a philologi&s;t, a very con&s;ummate &s;cholar, and a mo&s;t acute and ac|curate critic. Many occa&s;ional fugitive productions, which have either never reached the pre&s;s, or, if printed, have appeared anonymou&s;ly, are addi|tional te&s;timonies to the ju&s;t e&s;timation in which he is held by the literary world. We have only to lament that he &s;hould live below the mea&s;ure of abilities &s;o tran&s;cendent, in contradiction to na|ture's de&s;ign in the talents with which &s;he has &s;o liberally endowed him. What is genius (&s;ays an elegant writer) without a regulated life! And, &s;urely the paultry occupation of writing for a party journal,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morning Chronicle.</NOTE> and the unmanly indulgence of every exce&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, are mo&s;t derogatory to a character of fir&s;t-rate powers and attainments, yea verily beneath a Greek Profe&s;&s;or in one of our Univer&s;ities.</P>

<HEAD>PORTEUS, RT. REV. BEILBY, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>Lord Bi&s;hop of London, Dean of the Chapel Royal, &amp;c. This learned and amiable prelate, after having been Rector of Lambeth, and after holding the Bi&s;hoprick of Che&s;ter for eleven years, &s;ucceeded to the See of London, in the year 1787, on the decea&s;e of the venerable Dr. Lowth; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ri&s;en to his pre&s;ent high rank through the particular patronage of her Maje&s;ty. Dr. Porteus was educated at Chri&s;t's College, Cam|bridge, took his degree of B. A. in 1752, obtaining with Baron Ma&s;eres, the Chancellor's Medals at that Univer&s;ity on their fir&s;t in&s;titution, was, for &s;ome time, Fellow of the above Society, and gained the Seatonian Prize for a poetical E&s;&s;ay on Death, in 1759, which was publi&s;hed according to the will of the founder. His Lord&s;hip was al&s;o for many years, Chaplain to the late Archbi&s;hop Secker, and, in a&s;&s;ociation with Dr. Stinton, publi&s;hed the &s;even octavo volumes of Sermons by that eminent divine, prefixing a Review of his Grace's Life and Cha|racter. In the year 1776, Dr. Porteus di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his exertions to e&s;tabli&s;h a more &s;olemn ob&s;ervation of the Fa&s;t, Good-Friday, and pub|li&s;hed,
<PB N="151" REF="152">
in that year, a &s;erious, affectionate, and &s;en|&s;ible "Exhortation," to that effect. This produced a rude ill-natured attack upon his Lord&s;hip, from the late Mr. Robert Robin&s;on, of Che&s;terton near Cambridge, who publi&s;hed the Hi&s;tory and My&s;tery of Good-Friday, in order to ridicule the ob&s;ervance of it. Having, previou&s;ly, printed &s;everal occa|&s;ional &s;ingle Sermons, Dr. Porteus publi&s;hed in 1781 "A Brief Confutation of the Errors of the Church of Rome," extracted from Archbi&s;hop Secker's five Sermons again&s;t Popery, and de&s;igned for ge|neral di&s;tribution. Two years after this, he pro|duced a volume of Sermons on &s;everal &s;ubjects, to which he added a &s;econd volume, in the year 1794. In both of the&s;e volumes, many of the occa&s;ional &s;ingle Sermons, which his Lord&s;hip had formerly printed were republi&s;hed, and they are well known to rank among the mo&s;t perfect examples of pulpit eloquence in our language. Dr. Porteus has al&s;o publi&s;hed, a Letter to the Clergy of the Dioce&s;e of Che&s;ter concerning Sunday Schools, and a Charge delivered to the Clergy of the Dioce&s;e of London, at the primary Vi&s;itation, in 1790. His Lord|&s;hip's poetical talents have been hand&s;omely com|plimented by Hannah More, in her poem, Sen&s;ibi|lity. His &s;tyle in pro&s;e compo&s;ition is always cla&s;|&s;ical and correct, but, perhaps, he is too &s;tudious of avoiding the blandi&s;hments of ornament and fancy. In his epi&s;copal character, he is a pattern of pro|priety of conduct.</P>

It con|tains many very pretty compo&s;itions, particularly a beautiful farewell Hymn to the country, in imita|tion of Spen&s;er. Three years after this, his Tran|&s;lation of Ae&s;chylus made its appearance in a quarto volume, and has, ever &s;ince, been reprinted with the addition of notes, in two volumes, octavo. Of the excellence of this tran&s;lation, it is hardly po&s;&s;i|ble to &s;ay too much: many of the parts are &s;o ex|qui&s;itely beautiful as to leave us in doubt whether any poet, we have ever heard of, could have ac|compli&s;hed the ta&s;k with greater &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>Pa&s;t Matter of the Lodge of Antiquity, No. I. He is a native of Edinburgh, born in 1742, was for &s;ome time amanuen&s;is to the celebrated Tho|mas Ruddiman, and apprentice to his brother the printer, and has, &s;ince that time, become a &s;uper|intendent of the pre&s;s of Mr. Strahan in London. While in Scotland, he compiled a Catalogue of Mr. Ruddiman's Books; and, in May, 1772, deli|vered an Oration on the In&s;titution of Ma&s;onry, at a grand gala of eminent brethren, held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in the Strand. This compo&s;ition was afterward printed in the fir&s;t edi|tion of Mr. Pre&s;ton's "Illu&s;trations of Ma&s;onry," a well-written panegyrical view of that celebrated fraternity, publi&s;hed the &s;ame year. Having been appointed to the office of Deputy Grand Secretary, under James He&s;eltine, E&s;q. he compiled, for the benefit of the charity, the Hi&s;tory of Remarkable

Occurrences, in&s;erted in the two fir&s;t publications of the Freema&s;ons Calendar; prepared for the pre&s;s, an Appendix to the Book of Con&s;titutions; and, from the various memoranda he had made, formed the Hi&s;tory of Ma&s;onry, which was after|ward printed in his ILLUSTRATIONS. A di&s;pute taking place, in 1779, between the Grand Lodge and the Lodge of Antiquity, Mr. Pre&s;ton took the part of the Lodge and his private friends, in con|&s;equence of which his name was era&s;ed from the Hall Committee, and he was afterward, with &s;e|veral gentlemen, Members of that Lodge, expelled the Society. The treatment which he and his friends experienced on this occa&s;ion, was circum|&s;tantially related in a pamphlet, entitled, "A State of Facts, &amp;c," which was printed by Mr. Pre&s;ton, at his own expence, and circulated among his friends, but never &s;old: the leading circum&s;tances were al&s;o recorded in &s;ome of the latter editions of his ILLUSTRATIONS.

<HEAD>PRIESTLEY, REV. JOSEPH, L.L.D. F.R.S.</HEAD>
<P>Fellow of many foreign &s;ocieties, and a di&s;&s;ent|ing Clergyman, late of Hackney. This celebrated character was born at Field-head near Bri&s;tall, about &s;even miles from Leeds, in the year 1728-9. His father was a merchant and manufacturer: he received the early part of his education from the Rev. Mr. Scott, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter in the neigh|bourhood, and completed it under Mr. A&s;hworth, near Daventry in Northampton&s;hire. Dr. Prie&s;tley was educated in the &s;tricte&s;t principles of calvini&s;m; about the age of twenty he became an Arian, in which per&s;ua&s;ion he continued for fifteen or &s;ixteen years; and, at length, embraced the doctrines of Socinus, to which he was chiefly led by Dr. Lard|ner's Letters on the Logos. He was, for &s;everal years, Tutor in the Languages and Belles-Lettres, at the late di&s;&s;enting academy of Warrington, whence he returned to his native county, and took upon him&s;elf the pa&s;toral office at Mill-Hill Cha|pel, Leeds. In the year 1773, being appointed Chaplain and Librarian to the Marquis of Lan&s;|down, then Lord Shelburne, he quitted that &s;itua|tion, and re&s;ided with his Lord&s;hip for nearly &s;even years. A coolne&s;s taking place between them,
<PB N="165" REF="166">
and Dr. Prie&s;tley having received an invitation to &s;ettle with a &s;ociety of prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters at Bir|mingham, he undertook the pa&s;tor&s;hip of the new meeting of that town, on the la&s;t day of the year 1780. Here he long remained undi&s;turbed, al|though his pulpit Di&s;cour&s;es, his political pam|phlets, and his private conver&s;ation were well known to be highly inimical to the Government of his country, and, e&s;pecially, to her eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution. But his declamatory vehemence, and the indecency of his conduct to the neighbouring clergy, cau&s;ed him to be viewed, by the lower cla&s;&s;es in Birmingham, as a turbulent, &s;editious man: and, in July 1791, a flame, which had, for a long time, been gaining &s;trength under &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion, broke out with dreadful fury upon his devoted head. A mo&s;t infamous libel had been circulated, which was, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to inflame the minds of the populace; and the fabrication of this paper was ignorantly attributed to Dr. Prie&s;tley. At|tached to the Con&s;titution of their country, they re|&s;olved to inflict the heavie&s;t vengeance upon the man, who dared thus to in&s;ult them: and the con|&s;equences were dreadful, indeed. For &s;ome days, Birmingham was a mi&s;erable &s;cene of popular fury. Hou&s;es were pillaged, meeting-hou&s;es burned, and no bounds could have been put to the fury of the enraged mob, had it not been for the wi&s;e, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate conduct of the neighbouring nobility and gentry, who, at length, &s;ucceeded in re&s;toring
<PB N="166" REF="167">
peace to the di&s;tracted town. Dr. Prie&s;tley &s;uffered &s;everely. His hou&s;e, his library, with numerous unpubli&s;hed manu&s;cripts, his laboratory, and valu|able philo&s;ophical apparatus were all de&s;troyed. Part of the mob, inflamed with liquor, and more &s;avage than the re&s;t, had actually conceived the horrid de&s;ign of taking away his life: but the pre|vious intelligence he had received enabled him to elude their vengeance, and they contented them|&s;elves with burning his effigy. Upon his arrival in London, Dr. Prie&s;tley publi&s;hed a Letter, couched in haughty terms, by which he &s;eemed to con&s;ider him&s;elf as per&s;ecuted for righteousne&s;s' &s;ake: and, &s;oon afterward, he accepted an invitation to &s;uc|ceed the late Dr. Price, at the New-College, Hackney. His misfortunes had not, however, cured him of his political frenzy, and his conduct being, at length, marked by Government, a polite intimation was given him to quit the country. Upon this, he emigrated to America, and &s;ettled at Northumberland-Town, He was, not long ago, a candidate for the office of Chaplain to the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly at New York, but had a minority of votes in favour of Dr. Green.</P>
<P>Of the numerous literary productions by Dr. Prie&s;tley, the fir&s;t was a Treati&s;e on the Rudi|ments of Engli&s;h Grammar, which was publi&s;hed in a duodecimo volume, in 1761, and &s;even years af|terward, republi&s;hed with great additions and im|provements, in an octavo volume. This fir&s;t work
<PB N="167" REF="168">
was followed, in 1765, by his u&s;eful Charts of Biogra|phy, and of Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, and by an E&s;&s;ay on Liberal Education, in an octavo volume. In 1767, Dr. Prie&s;tley publi&s;hed an Hi&s;tory of Electricity, in a quarto volume; and a familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity, in a quarto pamphlet; and, in the year following, a Pamphlet on the Lord's Sup|per; a &s;mall Catechi&s;m; and an E&s;&s;ay on the fir&s;t Principles of Government, in an octavo volume. In 1769, was publi&s;hed Vol. I, (in octavo) of the Theological Repo&s;itory, con&s;i&s;ting of original e&s;|&s;ays, hints, queries, &amp;c. calculated to promote re|ligious knowledge, a periodical mi&s;cellany con|ducted by Dr. Prie&s;tley, and continued to &s;ix vo|lumes. Since that time he has written, in the cla&s;s of theology, a free Addre&s;s to Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters, on the Doctrines of Calvini&s;m; an Ad|dre&s;s to Ma&s;ters of Families: Con&s;iderations on Church Authority; Con&s;iderations on Differences of Opinion among Chri&s;tians; a View of the Prin|ciples and Conduct of the Prote&s;tant; Di&s;&s;enters; Additions to his Addre&s;s on the Lord's Supper; Letters to the Author of Remarks on &s;everal Publi|cations relative to the Di&s;&s;enters; An&s;wer to a &s;econd Letter to him on his Addre&s;s on the Lord's Supper; In&s;titutes of Natural and Revealed Reli|gion, in two volumes, octavo; a Farewell Sermon at Leeds; an Addre&s;s to Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters on giving the Lord's Supper to Children; Con&s;idera|tions for the U&s;e of Young Men; a Free Addre&s;s

<P>As a Controver&s;iali&s;t, no man upon record has been more di&s;tingui&s;hed than Dr. Prie&s;tley. He has been engaged with Mr. Venn, a methodi&s;t; with Mr. Berington, a Roman catholic clergyman; with Mr. Whitehead, a quaker; with Dr. Price and Mr. Palmer, di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters, and Mr. Jacob Bryant, on the &s;ubjects of Materiali&s;m and Philo&s;ophical Nece&s;&s;ity; with Bi&s;hop Newcome, on the duration of our Lord's Mini&s;try; with Mr. Hammon, a pretended athei&s;t; with Bi&s;hop Hor&s;|ley, Mr. Badcock, Mr. Burn, Mr, Hawkins, the Jews, (particularly Mr. Levi) and the followers of Baron Swedenborg; and, la&s;tly, with Mr. Brian Higgins (in particular) on Natural Philo&s;ophy, A &s;hort, but curious corre&s;pondence between Mr. Gibbon and Dr. Prie&s;tley, may al&s;o be &s;een in Lord Sheffield's publication of that gentleman's po&s;thu|mous Works; in which, though the Hi&s;torian &s;eems well to under&s;tand the <HI>direct tendency</HI> of the Doctor's character and opinions, the temper of the divine appears to much greater advantage than that of his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Of the abilities of Dr. Prie&s;tley, none can he|&s;itate to pronounce that they are of fir&s;t-rate excell|ence. His philo&s;ophical enquiries and publications claim the greate&s;t di&s;tinction, and have materially contributed to the advancement of &s;cience. As an experimental philo&s;opher, he is, perhaps, the very
<PB N="172" REF="173">
fir&s;t of his age. He has al&s;o been a mo&s;t indu&s;tri|ous divine; and, had he proved as diligent in pro|pagating truth, as in di&s;&s;eminating error, in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the go&s;pel in the minds of men, in&s;tead of &s;haking their belief in the doctrines of revelation, perhaps, few characters of the pre&s;ent century would have ranked higher as learned men, or have been held in greater e&s;timation. On the contrary his political and theological writings mu&s;t be pro|nounced to be fraught with principles the mo&s;t de|&s;tructive to the well-being of &s;ociety. It was a &s;aying of Dr. John&s;on that they were calculated to un&s;ettle every thing, but to &s;ettle nothing. The undaunted and unremitting con&s;tancy with which he has pur&s;ued the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his &s;peculative doctrines, has done infinitely more than was to be wi&s;hed, toward giving popularity to his metaphy&s;i|cal and theological &s;entiments: and, if their appre|hended effect has fortunately been counteracted, it is, probably, owing to their violence rather than to any other cau&s;e. The pillars of revelation, (&s;ays Mr. Gibbon) are &s;haken by tho&s;e men who pre|&s;erve the name without the &s;ub&s;tance of reli|gion, who indulge the licence without the temper of philo&s;ophy!</P>

<PB N="178" REF="179">
him&s;elf, have frequently repre&s;ented in Parliament. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, took his degree of M. A. in 1766, and was after|ward, for &s;ome time, in the Berk&s;hire Militia. On the death of Dr. Warton, in 1790, he &s;ucceeded that gentleman as Poet Laureat.</P>
<P>We believe Mr. Pye's fir&s;t literary production was an Ode on the Birth of the Prince of Wales, printed in the Oxford Collection. He afterward, occa&s;ionally, publi&s;hed &s;ingly and anonymou&s;ly, &s;e|veral original Poems; and al&s;o excellent Tran&s;la|tions of the &s;ix Olympic Odes of Pindar, omitted by Mr. We&s;t; and a Tran&s;lation of the Art of War, a poem, from the French of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, written in 1778, at his lei&s;ure hours during the encampment at Coxheath. In 1783, he pub|li&s;hed, with his name, the Progre&s;s of Refinement, a poem; and, four years afterward, "Poems on various Subjects," in two octavo volumes, in which all of the pieces, above referred-to, were collected, and a few new ones added. A very elegant Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation of the Song of Harmodius and Ari&s;to|geiton, in which the turn of expre&s;&s;ion of the ori|ginal has been imitated with extraordinary felicity, is to be found, among other excellent pieces, in this collection. Mr. Pye's &s;ub&s;equent publications have been, a Tran&s;lation of the Poetic of Ari&s;totle, fir&s;t publi&s;hed in an octavo volume, in 1788, and after|ward prefixed to a Commentary on that work, pub|li&s;hed in a quarto volume; Amu&s;ement, a poetical
<PB N="179" REF="180">
e&s;&s;ay, publi&s;hed in 1790; the War Elegies of Tyr|taeus imitated, and addre&s;&s;ed to the People of Great Britain, publi&s;hed in 1795; the Siege of Meaux, a tragedy, acted at Covent Garden Theatre; and Leonore, a tale, tran&s;lated from the German of Burger. He is al&s;o &s;peedily about to pre&s;ent the public with a Poem on the Origin and Progre&s;s of Navigation, which, as we have under&s;tood, is to clo&s;e with a &s;plendid apo&s;trophe, commemorating our late glorious naval victories.</P>
<P>The poetry of Mr. Pye cannot, perhaps, upon the whole, be &s;aid to be of that very &s;uperior kind, which has univer&s;ally exacted from his readers the applau&s;e of fir&s;t-rate excellence. Yet, none can deny that he is always the elegant &s;cholar, the man of ta&s;te and fancy, and the writer of poli&s;hed ver|&s;ification; while the great intere&s;ts of virtue and public &s;pirit-have uniformly been countenanced by his pen. His ARISTOTLE, though a performance of con&s;iderable merit, has been di&s;placed by the work, &s;o &s;ingularly ma&s;terly, of Mr. Twining.

<P>A LADY of great di&s;tinction in the literary world as a Novel-writer.

Since that time, &s;he has written, "A Sicilian Romance," in two duodecimo vo|lumes; the Romance of the Fore&s;t, in three duo|decimo volumes; the My&s;teries of Udolpho, in four duodecimo volumes; and the Italian, in three duodecimo volumes. They have all been very ge|nerally read and admired, e&s;pecially, the Romance of the Fore&s;t, and the My&s;teries of Udolpho. Her powers of plea&s;ing, in this line of compo&s;ition, are very &s;ingularly great; and the happy combination of various talents which her pieces di&s;play, entitles their author to rank among the fir&s;t novel-writers of her age; while the beautiful ver&s;es inter&s;per&s;ed among her tales, mu&s;t rai&s;e her highly in the e&s;tima|tion of every poetical genius.

<HEAD>ROBERTS, WILLIAM, ESQ. A.M. F.A.S.</HEAD>
<P>Of Gray's Inn. A gentleman who&s;e literary attainments are of very &s;ingular di&s;tinction and ex|cellence. He is the younger &s;on of the &s;ubject of the preceeding article, was educated at Corpus Chri&s;ti College, Oxford, became a Fellow of that &s;ociety, and was originally de&s;tined to the church, which he afterward relinqui&s;hed in favour of the law. While at the Univer&s;ity, he obtained, about the year 1788, a prize for an E&s;&s;ay on Refinement, which is one of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly and elegant per|formances we almo&s;t ever recollect to have &s;een. A few copies only of it were printed for the &s;ake of pri|vate di&s;tribution. Mr. Roberts was al&s;o, about that time, a frequent contributor to the Engli&s;h Review, which was then certainly the be&s;t-conducted literary journal of the day; and, we believe, he al&s;o pub|li&s;hed, at the Univer&s;ity, an Account of the Ox|ford Marbles, in a duodecimo volume. On leaving College, he travelled, for a &s;hort time, on the con|tinent; and, &s;oon after his return, commenced the publication of his excellent periodical paper, "The Looker-on." No. I. made its appearance, (in fo|lio) March 10th, 1792, the fir&s;t twenty-five num|bers were publi&s;hed on Tue&s;days and Saturdays,
<PB N="205" REF="206">
then, after an interval of a few months, it was continued on Saturdays only, and the la&s;t number was dated, December 21&s;t 1793. Of the few con|tributors to this work, Mr. Beresford (vide that name) was the chief. The &s;econd edition was printed in three duodecimo volumes; and the third, in four, with &s;ome additions.</P>
<P>Very few, indeed, are, in our opinion, the in|&s;tances, which the Engli&s;h language affords, of &s;uch fini&s;hed &s;pecimens of e&s;&s;ay-writing, as are to be found in the Looker-on. The ta&s;te, knowledge, and ingenuity, the &s;terling wit, the happy raillery, and the elegance of &s;tyle, with which the&s;e papers are conceived and written, mu&s;t ever characteri&s;e them as very fir&s;t-rate performances of their kind; while we know of no in&s;tance, in particular, in which a writer has di&s;played greater power over the feelings of his readers, than in the beautiful and natural &s;tory of EUGENIO. The reigning whims and follies of the age have never, in our opinion, &s;ince the days of Addi&s;on been combated by the weapons of wit and rea&s;on with equal addre&s;s: and, if the 'ur|banity of critici&s;m, the elegance of morality, and the playfulne&s;s of allu&s;ion,' which &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;h the SPECTATOR, be any where to be looked for &s;ince tho&s;e days, it mu&s;t be in the lucu|brations of Simon Olivebranch. The RAMBLER is a&s;&s;uredly the only periodical paper, which can, by any means, a&s;pire to the rank of the&s;e two pro|ductions; and, let none incautiou&s;ly detract from
<PB N="206" REF="207">
the &s;olid merit of that performance. It has been truly called a body of ethics: and, to give it the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible prai&s;e, it is a work who&s;e profundity and who&s;e compo&s;ition are worthy of the great logician and lexicographer whom it owns for its author. Yet, the charms with which Addi&s;on in&s;tructs, have gained him, with mo&s;t readers, a preference to his great &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or; and the Looker-on, with a perfect origi|nality of his own, and with the becoming character of a writer of his own time, is &s;urely the SPEC|TATOR, rather than the RAMBLER of his day.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular and a melancholy con&s;ideration that this work, although favourably received, has not experienced from the public that extraordinary di&s;tinction to which its extraordinary merit certainly entitled it; for let it be read for our amu&s;ement, for the improvement of our ta&s;te, or for the greater &s;akes of our religion and our morals, it &s;hall be found to an&s;wer all our purpo&s;es with &s;uperior excel|lence. Some blame has, perhaps, been ju&s;tly be&s;towed upon the author, for an occa&s;ional ex|ce&s;s, in the amplification of his &s;ubjects, and for an over-wrought nicety of &s;tyle, too like what may be called a fal&s;e refinement in writing: yet, the&s;e are but as du&s;t in the balance. It is not to the&s;e cau&s;es, we fear, that we are to look for the evil; but to the ta&s;tele&s;sne&s;s and in&s;ipidity of the larger portion of that &s;hallow age in which the work was written. Melancholy, indeed, is the reflection that the good ta&s;te, which we once, undoubtedly,
<PB N="207" REF="208">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;hould, &s;o far, have for&s;aken us, as to neglect &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed merit!</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this article by applying to Mr. Roberts the language u&s;ed by one of Mr. Burke's political adver&s;aries, when &s;peaking of that tran&s;cendent writer; alledging as our rea&s;on for &s;o doing, that, we know of no LIVING AUTHOR to whom we think them more properly applicable. <Q>He is a writer of the mo&s;t &s;plendid and une|qualled powers; the fa&s;cination and magic of who&s;e eloquence cannot be with&s;tood. His im|perial fancy has laid all nature under tribute, and has collected riches from every &s;cene of the cre|ation, and every walk of art. His images are &s;o &s;elect, &s;o rich with colours dipt in Heaven, that whoever can read his works without rapture may have merit as a rea&s;oner, but mu&s;t re&s;ign all preten&s;ions to ta&s;te and &s;en&s;ibility.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall's Apology for the Freedom of the Pre&s;s.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>ROBINSON, MRS. MARY.</HEAD>
<P>The maiden name of this celebrated lady, who is de&s;cended from a very re&s;pectable family, was Darby. Her father lo&s;t his fortune in promoting a &s;cheme for the commercial advantage of this coun|try, and, afterward, accepted the command of a &s;eventy-four-gun &s;hip, in the &s;ervice of the late Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. Her mother is grand daughter to Catharine Seys, of Boverton Ca&s;tle in Glamor|gan&s;hire; who&s;e &s;i&s;ter, Ann Seys, a woman cele|brated for her virtues and accompli&s;hments, married Lord King, then Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. Mrs. Robin&s;on was born in the College Green, Bri&s;tol, received the early part of her educa|tion in that city, and, at the age of fifteen, married her pre&s;ent hu&s;band, who was then a &s;tudent in Lincoln's Inn. Shortly afterward, &s;he thought it proper to exerci&s;e her talents on the &s;tage, and came out in Juliet, under the particular patronage of the Dutche&s;s of Devon&s;hire, on the 10th of De|cember, 1776. For three &s;ea&s;ons &s;he continued to perform the parts of Lady Macbeth, Imogen, Ro|&s;alind, Cordelia, Ophelia, Viola, Palmira, the Iri&s;h Widow, Perdita, &amp;c. with great applau&s;e; and, having in the latter character, attracted by her ele|gance and beauty, the notice of a certain di&s;tin|gui&s;hed FLORIZEL, &s;he quitted the &s;tage at a
<PB N="214" REF="215">
time when &s;he was ri&s;ing rapidly in the e&s;timation of the public.</P>
<P>Of the literary productions of Mrs. Robin&s;on, we believe, the fir&s;t was a &s;mall octavo volume of "Poems," publi&s;hed in 1775. Two years after|ward &s;he wrote "Captivity," a poem, and Celadon and Lydia, a tale, which were printed together, in a quarto pamphlet, dedicated to her patrone&s;s, the Dutche&s;s of Devon&s;hire. In 1778, &s;he brought out a farce, entitled, "The Lucky E&s;cape," for her own benefit, at Drury Lane. None of the&s;e productions appear to have attracted that notice, by which the later writings of their fair author have been &s;o re|markably di&s;tingui&s;hed; and her pen appears to have been unemployed till about the year 1787, when &s;he figured in the new&s;paper, THE WORLD, under the &s;ignature, Anna Matilda. For an ac|count of the corre&s;pondence with Delia Cru&s;ca, kept up from poetical &s;ympathy, at intervals, for two years, we refer the reader to our memoir of Mr. Merry; and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that we think her poems in the collection, entitled, "The Briti&s;h Album," certainly claim the &s;econd place in point of merit. Mrs. Robin&s;on al&s;o produced many pieces about this time in THE ORACLE, under the &s;ignatures Laura Maria, Julia, Laura, Oberon, &amp;c. In 1790, &s;he publi&s;hed a poem, in&s;cribed to Mr. Merry, under the title, <HI>Ain&s;i va le Monde</HI>; and, in the year following, produced her elegant octavo vo|lume of "Poems," which was honoured by a
<PB N="215" REF="216">
very &s;plendid li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers. The poetical productions with which Mrs. Robin&s;on has fa|voured the world, &s;ince that publication, are, a Monody to the Memory of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds; Sight, the Cavern of Woe, and Solitude, pub|li&s;hed together, in a quarto pamphlet; Modern Manners, a poem, by Horace Juvenal; a Monody to the Memory of the late Queen of France; and Vol. II. of "Poems," in which &s;ome of the&s;e pieces are reprinted. In the year 1792, Mrs. Ro|bin&s;on publi&s;hed her fir&s;t novel, "Vancenza;" and has, &s;ince that time, written, "The Widow," "An|gelina," and "Hubert de Sevrac," novels; and "The Sicilian Lover," a tragedy. Several popular Pamphlets have al&s;o been attributed to her pen.</P>
<P>The beauty of Mrs. Robin&s;on's poetry has ob|tained her the dignified appellation of THE ENG|LISH SAPPHO. She is &s;ometimes feeble, and &s;ome|times degenerates into a fal&s;e ta&s;te; but the poetic imagery, the feeling and tenderne&s;s, the warmth and elegance, and, above all, the delicacy of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which breathe through her poems can &s;eldom fail to lay her reader under a bountiful contribution of applau&s;e. As a novel-writer, we think this lady much le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful. Her VAN|CENZA &s;peedily reached a third edition, becau&s;e it was the work of Mrs. Robin&s;on; but &s;urely in falls greatly &s;hort of many of her countrywomen, this, as well as in her &s;ub&s;equent attempts, &s;he in the talent of plea&s;ing. Her tragedy (The Si|cilian

<HEAD>ROSCOE, WILLIAM, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>Of Liverpool. A gentleman who has acquired great and merited renown in the literary world, by the ma&s;terly manner in which he has, of late, ex|hibited to the public, the Life and Labours of Lo|renzo de' Medici, called the Magnificent. Mr. Ro&s;coe was brought up to the profe&s;&s;ion of an attorney, but does not, we believe, at pre&s;ent, prac|tice in that line. The above-mentioned work does the highe&s;t credit to his literary talents, and entitles him to rank with the very fir&s;t writers on European Hi&s;tory. The circum&s;tances attending this publi|cation, are not among the lea&s;t &s;ingular in the annals of literature. The full, di&s;tinct, and accurate idea afforded us, with &s;uch genius and learning, of the intere&s;ting &s;ubject treated in the&s;e volumes, is the re&s;ult of di&s;coveries made in the literature of one of the mo&s;t polite and learned nations of Europe, by a foreigner who had never vi&s;ited that country! By a gentleman who was not courting literature in academical bowers, but devoting his time to an active and a laborious profe&s;&s;ion! Mr. Clarke a banker of Liverpool, and &s;on of the late banker of the &s;ame name, a gentleman of very exten&s;ive
<PB N="221" REF="222">
information, and the intimate friend of Mr. Ro&s;coe, had paid a vi&s;it to Italy, and had fixed his winter re&s;idence at Florence. It was through the a&s;&s;iduity of this gentleman, that Mr. Ro&s;coe obtained his large &s;tock of original and intere&s;ting information; as well as the beautiful Poems of Lorenzo de' Me|dici (with copies of which, as well as with beau|tiful and exact Tran&s;lations of them, he has enriched his work) the originals of which are depo&s;ited in the Laurentian Library, although the former editiors appear not to have had the &s;lighte&s;t information re|&s;pecting them! The work made its fir&s;t appearance in 1795, in two volumes, quarto, under the title, "The Life of Lorenzo de' Medici, called the Mag|nificent." Such, we have under&s;tood, was the au|thor's diffidence of its &s;ucce&s;s, that the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of only two hundred and fifty co|pies! So &s;mall a number di&s;appeared very &s;oon after publication; and, although the work was printed in the expen&s;ive &s;tyle and &s;old at a propor|tional price, it has &s;een three editions, even in times &s;o unpropitious as the pre&s;ent. Nor (as every reader can foretel) has it obtained early po|pularity, without the pro&s;pect of a la&s;ting reputation. It holds the place which it fills in the Hi&s;tory of Europe by too lawful a tenure ever to renounce its privileges.</P>
<P>The celebrated and excellent Letter to Mr. Pitt, BY JASPER WILSON, has been improperly attributed to Mr. Ro&s;coe. It is the production of

While in this capacity, he publi&s;hed &s;everal political pamphlets, the fir&s;t of which appeared in 1782, under the title, "A &s;hort Review of the Tran&s;actions in Bengal during the la&s;t ten years."

From this parent &s;he received the advantage of a good education, di&s;covered early &s;ymptoms of the rhyming propen&s;ity, and, becom|ing acquainted with the late Lady Miller of Bath-Ea&s;ton, was a frequent and, &s;ometimes, a &s;ucce&s;s|ful candidate for the myrtle wreath of the poetic in&s;titution of that villa. Her fir&s;t regular publica|tion was a beautiful Elegy on Captain Cook, which,
<PB N="245" REF="246">
together with an Ode to the Sun (a Bath-Ea&s;ton Prize Poem) was publi&s;hed in a quarto pamphlet, in 1780. In the year following, &s;he produced a Monody on her gallant and amiable friend Major Andr&egrave;; and, it is &s;aid, that Dr. Darwin, &s;peaking of this poem and the one on Captain Cook, u&s;ed to tell her &s;he was the inventre&s;s of Epic Elegy. Mi&s;s Seward's &s;ub&s;equent productions have been, a Poem to the Memory of Lady Miller; Loui&s;a, a poetical novel; an Ode on General Elliot's Return from Gibraltar; and "Llangollen Vale, with other Poems," publi&s;hed in a quarto pamphlet, in 1796.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e productions, perhaps, the fir&s;t, in point of popularity, is the poetical novel; while the one held in highe&s;t e&s;timation for poetical value, by the fair author her&s;elf, is, we are told, the Ode on General Elliot's Return.

Be&s;ide the poems above mentioned, &s;he has contributed many original fugitive Pieces, and &s;ome Tran&s;lations of Odes of Horace to the Gen|tleman's Magazine; and has announced for &s;peedy publication, a collection (in quarto) to be entitled, "Sonnets and Horatian Odes."</P>

<P>This celebrated character is of a family which during the greater part of the pre&s;ent century has been eminent for genius and learning. His grand|father was the intimate friend and favourite of Doctor Swift, the companion of his lei&s;ure, the &s;ha|rer of his confidence, and the imitator of his wit. His father was the corrector of the Engli&s;h accent, and was acknowledged to be the be&s;t declaimer in the Engli&s;h Language of his day: he was, for a
<PB N="251" REF="252">
con&s;iderable time, manager of the Dublin Theatre, and being compelled, by the animo&s;ity of party, to quit that &s;ituation, acquired &s;ame and profit in London as an actor, and as a lecturer. The mo|ther of Mr. Sheridan could al&s;o boa&s;t a di&s;tingui&s;hed literary reputation, obtained by &s;everal Plays, No|vels, and other Pieces of con&s;iderable merit.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan was born at Quilea, near Dublin, in the year 1752. At the age of &s;ix years, his fa|ther, then compelled to quit his native country, brought him to England, and placed him at Harrow School, under the care of Dr. Sumner, who was, at that time, the head-ma&s;ter. Here Mr. Sheridan contracted a friend&s;hip with Dr. Parr, then one of the under-ma&s;ters, which has, ever &s;ince &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, between them. It does not appear that he was ever a member of either of the Univer&s;ities; but, the law being his de&s;tination, was entered of the Middle Temple. At the age of eighteen years, he tran&s;lated from the Greek, in a&s;&s;ociation with a friend, the Epi&s;tles of Ari&s;taenetus, and al&s;o, about that time, printed &s;everal pieces, which are known only to his intimate friends, and among which, we believe, was an An&s;wer to the celebrated Heroic Epi&s;tle to Sir William Chambers. Re&s;iding for &s;ome time at Bath, he became acquainted with Mi&s;s Elizabeth Linley, daughter of the late Paten|tee of Drury Lane, of that name. This lady, celebrated no le&s;s, in her day, for her mental than for her per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, was highly di&s;|tingui&s;hed,
<PB N="252" REF="253">
at that time, as a public &s;inger: and a part of her &s;tory, very honourable to her&s;elf, rela|tive to a propo&s;al of marriage, is commemorated by Foote, under the character of Mi&s;s Linnet, in his comedy, entitled, "The Maid of Bath." Not long after this affair, Mr. Sheridan made honourable propo&s;als to her, and was engaged, on her account in a duel, with a Captain Matthews, which was very &s;ingular for the courage, ferocity, and invete|rate re&s;entment di&s;played by the parties. In 1773, his &s;uit was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; and, though his lady brought him little or no fortune, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that his &s;ub&s;equent figure in the world, has been, in &s;ome degree owing to this marriage. He was now in his twenty-&s;econd or twenty-third year, and even at this early period, di&s;covered that pride and dignity of mind, which, though not always de&s;irable companions in the commerce of life, are mo&s;tly characteri&s;tic of a ge|nerous &s;pirit, and a true genius. For, notwith|&s;tanding his narrow circum&s;tances, and the di&s;tance at which he was then removed from tho&s;e brilliant pro&s;pects, which he afterward had in view, he would not allow Mrs. Sheridan to engage her&s;elf at any place of public entertainment.</P>
<P>Depending on his own talents alone for &s;upport, Mr. Sheridan fir&s;t turned his thoughts to dramatic compo&s;ition; and, in January, 1775, brought out at Covent Garden Theatre his comedy, THE RIVALS. This piece, as it was originally played,
<PB N="253" REF="254">
nearly doubled in length the generality of theatri|cal performances. It &s;uffered greatly on the fir&s;t night from the &s;everity of the audience, and with difficulty obtained a &s;econd hearing. Several cau&s;es con&s;pired to produce this effect, among which, in ju&s;tice to Mr. Sheridan, mu&s;t be mentioned the mi&s;erable manner in which &s;ome of the performers (Mr. Lee in particular) acted their parts. Being, however, new moulded by the author, it was re|ceived with con&s;iderable applau&s;e, and has conti|nued a favourite with the public. This play abounds in character and &s;ituation: yet, though it bears indi&s;putable marks of the fertility of the au|thor's genius, it is, certainly, far from a perfect compo&s;ition. The character of Mrs. Malaprop, who is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ordinary run of illi|terate pretenders, by the mere circum&s;tance of her pronouncing hard words correctly, but u&s;ing them in an improper &s;en&s;e, in&s;tead of murdering, the words them&s;elves, as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e, is &s;urely ill-conceived and unnatural. The idea of Acres, with his new-fangled oaths, always &s;wear|ing by objects appropriate to the &s;ubject of which he is treating, &s;eems an equal violation of proba|bility; and there appears to run through the piece an endeavour to give character and originality, which is always built upon affected circum&s;tances, and not upon experience and knowledge of human nature. When Mr. Sheridan publi&s;hed this co|medy, he acknowldged his youth and inexperience,
<PB N="254" REF="255">
and adopted the error of dreading imitation, a&s;&s;ert|ing in his preface that, <Q>on &s;ubjects on which the mind has been much informed, invention is &s;low of exerting it&s;elf.</Q> Yet, it has always happened in &s;ome degree to tho&s;e writers, who think that the want of information will a&s;&s;i&s;t their invention, that they have incurred the very cen&s;ure they were anxious to avoid, and have exhibited as new what is &s;tale and hackneyed, and what a more in|timate acquaintance with their &s;ubject would have taught them to reject. In this year he al&s;o produced, St. Patrick's Day, a farce, which was originally repre&s;ented for the benefit of Mr. Clinch, who &s;eems to have been favoured with it, in con&s;e|quence or his repre&s;entation of the Iri&s;hman in the Rivals, in which he greatly excelled Mr. Lee.</P>
<P>In the following year, Mr. Sheridan enriched the Engli&s;h drama, with his celebrated comic opera, THE DUENNA. The &s;ucce&s;s of this piece was beyond all former example. The Beggar's Opera which had all the wits and half the nobi|lity of England for its &s;upports, ran &s;ixty-three nights in one &s;ea&s;on; the Duenna, &s;eventy-five. The &s;atire of this piece is beautiful and poignant; the fla&s;hes of wit are perpetual and always genuine; while the &s;ongs are characteri&s;ed by that <HI>onction.</HI> that ripene&s;s and mellowne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, which is, probably, the grand &s;ecret of &s;ong-writing. This piece did not reach the pre&s;s, by the author's con&s;ent till the year 1794.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256">But, even the merit of the Duenna was thrown into comparative oblivion on the appearance, in the following year, of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL. No dramatic production ever equalled this cele|brated piece in &s;ucce&s;s. It can receive no honour from additional prai&s;e, nor is it likely to be injured by the &s;evere&s;t critical examination. Character it is true, is not the fort even of this greate&s;t pro|duction of our author; yet, the plot is &s;o natural, the mirror held up &s;o true, the incidents follow with &s;uch ea&s;e and grace, the dialogue is &s;o cha&s;te and lively, the wit &s;o brilliant and &s;tirling, and every thing is &s;o exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed and &s;o happily conveyed, that our entertainment is unbounded, and we can never enough applaud our mirth. This piece (the policy, as we &s;uppo&s;e, of our earlie&s;t theatres being on this occa&s;ion revived) has never lawfully reached the pre&s;s, though, &s;ome editions of it have been printed in Ireland, from a &s;mug|gled copy, and &s;old here.</P>
<P>In 1778, Mr. Sheridan brought out at Drury Lane "The Camp," a dramatic entertainment, intended to compliment the Dutche&s;s of Devon&s;hire, which has never been printed; and, in the follow|ing year, "The Critic, or a Tragedy Rehear&s;ed," a farce, which <HI>has</HI> reached the pre&s;s. The Critic is di&s;tingui&s;hed by that genuine wit, which has &s;o often characteri&s;ed the productions of its author, and is a piece which has obtained the frequently repeated applau&s;es of the public. Its fir&s;t act has
<PB N="256" REF="257">
particular merit, in the character of Sir Fretful Plagiary, which, as is well known, is a &s;atire upon Mr. Richard Cumberland, a gentleman of mild and amiable manners, but, who is probably, in &s;ome degree, &s;ubject to the weakne&s;s here ridiculed, and who had been &s;o ill-advi&s;ed, or &s;o unfortunate as to give offence to Mr. Sheridan. The two la&s;t acts, which con&s;i&s;t of a mock tragedy, have as much merit as their &s;ubject will allow, under the two-fold di&s;advantage of being barren in it&s;elf, and of having been anticipated by the popular comedy of the Rehear&s;al. The author of the Rehear&s;al had the advantage of writing in an aera of fal&s;e ta&s;te, and of having for the topic of his ridicule, the ab&s;urdities of &s;o great a genius as Mr. Dryden. The errors of more modern tragedies were too evan|e&s;cent for &s;atire, and Mr. Sheridan, in order to be intelligible, was obliged, &s;ometimes to have re|cour&s;e to the be&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of Shak&s;peare: now it is true that our mirth may be excited by a trave&s;ty of Homer or Virgil, but we never can applaud the author. To the pen of Mr. Sheridan are al&s;o to be attributed, "A Trip to Scarborough," a co|medy, as <HI>altered</HI> from Vanburgh's <HI>Relap&s;e</HI>; a Mo|nody to the Memory of Mr. Garrick, which would have reflected lu&s;tre upon an inferior genius, but added nothing to our admiration of Mr. Sheridan; the Prologue to Captain Ay&s;cough's tragedy, Semi|ramis, which is a beautiful piece of poetry; and &s;everal more highly elegant trifles, which are to be
<PB N="257" REF="258">
found in different collections of fugitive pieces. The public has al&s;o, for many years, been flattered with the hopes of receiving from the &s;ame &s;ource, "The Fore&s;ters," a comic opera; and Affectation, a comedy; but, from the length of their delay, we may be led to de&s;pair of their appearance.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1776, when Mr, Garrick re|tired from the &s;tage, that Mr. Sheridan purcha&s;ed, in a&s;&s;ociation with Mr. Linley his father-in-law, and with Dr. Ford, one moiety of the property of Dru|ry Lane Theatre; to which they &s;oon afterward added the other moiety. Mr. Sheridan's &s;hare of this property is &s;aid to have been more than a half; and, for &s;ome years, he continued the acting ma|nager of the theatre. His carele&s;sne&s;s and inatten|tion to the intere&s;ts of this &s;ituation were very con|&s;picuous, and the credit of old Drury certainly lo&s;t: a &s;turdy prop in her celebrated Garrick. But, hav|ing completed every thing with regard to the &s;tage, to which his ambition could a&s;pire, Mr. Sheridan turned the activity of his mind to another object, and was encouraged, by the friend&s;hip of Mr. Fox, to offer him&s;elf a candidate for repre&s;enting the town of Stafford in the Parliament, which was &s;ummoned to meet October 30th, 1780. The new life into which his &s;ucce&s;s introduced him, exalted his views, and, by engaging his talents in the concerns of his country, has had a fatal effect on his dramatic pur&s;uits. Yet, it mu&s;t be acknowledged a remark|able circum&s;tance that a writer &s;hould &s;o &s;oon have
<PB N="258" REF="259">
reached the highe&s;t pinnacle of excellence, in a path &s;o arduous of a&s;cent, and that he &s;hould then have relinqui&s;hed it for ever.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan did not inherit from nature every advantage toward making him a great public &s;peaker. His voice, in particular, was neither &s;trong, harmonious, nor of con&s;iderable compa&s;s. He had, however, the benefit of a remarkably clear and accurate articulation, and was early initiated in ideas of public &s;peaking by his father. The difficul|ties under which he laboured were conquered by unwearied per&s;everance, and by the exerci&s;e of his voice on trifling topics and ordinary occa&s;ions. This conque&s;t was not completed when he was appointed, in 1782, Under Secretary of State, in the department of Mr. Fox, or when, in the year following, he was promoted to the place of Secre|tary to the Trea&s;ury under the Duke of Portland. In the &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1785, he made a celebrated Speech upon the fourth of the twenty Iri&s;h Propo&s;itions; and, in the following year, upon a motion, brought forward by him&s;elf, upon the &s;ubject of finance: of the former of the&s;e Speeches a tolerable report was publi&s;hed, and has been in&s;erted in the Par|liamentary Regi&s;ter. But Mr. Sheridan ro&s;e to his greate&s;t height, as a &s;peaker, in 1787, when he opened the third article of impeachment, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings, upon the &s;ubject of the puni&s;hment inflicted by him for the rebellion of the Prince&s;&s;es of Oude. This
<PB N="259" REF="260">
&s;peech was five hours and a half in length, and tho&s;e who heard it &s;eemed to think that no lan|guage could do ju&s;tice to its wit, its &s;ublimity, and its pathos. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add that Mr. Sheridan has, for many years, been one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed leaders of the oppo&s;ition. As an elegant &s;cholar, we may &s;afely &s;ay he has not a &s;uperior in the &s;enate of his country; and, however different the &s;en&s;ations may be, with which his cha|racter will impre&s;s &s;ome of tho&s;e who contemplate him as a genius and as a man, the urbanity of his behaviour in that a&s;&s;embly, and the uniformly cla&s;|&s;ical elegance and grace of his diction, mu&s;t command the admiration of all.</P>
<P>Not many years after the lo&s;s of his fir&s;t wife, Mr. Sheridan married, in 1794, Mi&s;s Ogle, daughter of the Dean of Winche&s;ter. About this time he attempted to di&s;po&s;e of his property in the theatre, but, though he &s;old a part of it, he &s;till retains the larger &s;hare.</P>

as an author has been in the Account he has pub|li&s;hed of the Emba&s;&s;y to China. This long ex|pected work made its appearance in Augu&s;t, 1797; in two volumes, quarto, accompanied by a folio volume of plates, under the title, "An Authentic Account of the Emba&s;&s;y from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China." Such was the public curio&s;ity, that, although it was printed in a very expen&s;ive &s;tyle, and the impre&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of a large number of copies, every one was &s;ub|&s;cribed for long before the day of publication. An octavo edition of it, in three volumes, has been publi&s;hed &s;ince its fir&s;t appearance. The AC|COUNT was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney, the Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary; of Sir Era&s;mus Gower, Com|mander of the expedition; and of other gentlemen in the &s;everal departments of the Emba&s;&s;y. Though it may be &s;aid to contain little additional infor|mation re&s;pecting China, to what was already to be found in the writings of Duhalde, Gro&s;ier, and others who have travelled in that country, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Sir George Staunton en|joyed peculiar advantages for de&s;cribing with ac|curacy the phy&s;ical as well as moral &s;tate of the va&s;t empire. So remarkable an in&s;tance of the ne|ce&s;&s;ary abilities and opportunities to collect infor|mation, and of &s;trict authenticity in reporting it, as concurred in the ca&s;e of the gentlemen who accompanied this emba&s;&s;y, can very rarely

Not long after this, he publi&s;hed a Letter to the Ea&s;t India Directors; an Analy&s;is of the Political Hi&s;tory of India, in an octavo volume; Thoughts on Martial Law, a pamphlet; and Philo&s;ophical Rhap&s;odies, Fragments of Akbur of Betlis, containing Reflec|tions on the Laws, Manners, Cu&s;toms, and Reli|gions of certain A&s;iatic, Afric, and European Na|tions," in three octavo volumes.

<P>This celebrated traveller is the younge&s;t &s;on of the late Sir John Swinburne, Bart. of Capheaton in Northumberland, the long-e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;eat of that ancient Roman Catholic family. He was edu|cated

at Scorton School in York&s;hire; and, after|ward, &s;tudied at Paris, Bourdeaux, and the Royal Academy at Turin. After this he made the u&s;ual tour of Italy, and, in 1774, travelled with his lady on the Continent, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of in|dulging their ta&s;te for antiquities and the fine arts. Mr. Swinburne &s;pent &s;ix years in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, during which time he formed an intimacy with &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated lite|rati of tho&s;e countries, and received &s;ome &s;ignal marks of e&s;teem from the Sovereigns of the courts he vi&s;ited. On his return to England he retired to his &s;eat at Ham&s;terly, in the Bi&s;hoprick of Dur|ham, which has been his place of chief re&s;idence &s;ince that time.

Both of the&s;e works have been reprinted in octavo; the fir&s;t in two, and the la&s;t in four volumes. The learning and ingenuity of Mr. Swinburne are too well known to require an additional panegyric from us.

<P>This con&s;picuous character, after a very infe|rior education, was articled to an attorney; and early in life exhibited that re&s;tle&s;s, un&s;atisfied, tur|bulent di&s;po&s;ition, by which he has of late peculi|arly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf. Upon the publication
<PB N="302" REF="303">
of Paine's "Rights of Man," Mr. Thelwall was one of the fir&s;t to di&s;play a zealous attachment to his principles; and he &s;oon afterward began to deli|ver a cour&s;e of Lectures of an inflammatory ten|dency, at Beaufort Buildings in the Strand. Here, evening after evening, he thundered out philip|pics again&s;t the Con&s;titution of his country, with the vehemence of an impa&s;&s;ioned demagogue, to the admiration of the vile&s;t refu&s;e of the metropo|lis. In the year 1794, the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es were in|terrupted by the hand of Government, and the ora|tor was conveyed to the Tower to take his trial, together with Hardy, Tooke and &s;ome other un|ruly citizens. During his confinement, Mr. Thel|wall wrote &s;ome Poems, which were publi&s;hed after his relea&s;e. Having been tried at the Se&s;&s;ions Hou&s;e, Old Bailey, in November, 1794, and ac|quitted with the other pri&s;oners, his &s;ub&s;equent behaviour has been no le&s;s marked by its mi&s;|chievous tendency, than it was previou&s;ly to his impri&s;onment. Under the &s;emblance of illu&s;trating Ancient Hi&s;tory, he has continued his political Lectures, and has transferred his pernicious &s;chool to different parts of the country. At Yarmouth he was, &s;ome time ago, interrupted in a very &s;e|rious manner in the mid&s;t of his oratory, by the abrupt entrance of a body of &s;ailors, who were heated with liquor, and who, actuated by an im|iprudent zeal, committed &s;everal unju&s;tifiable acts
<PB N="303" REF="304">
of violence upon the auditory. He al&s;o experienced &s;ome riotous oppo&s;ition at Lynn and at Wi&s;beach.</P>
<P>As an author, Mr. Thelwall made his fir&s;t ap|pearance in 1787, when he publi&s;hed Orlando and Almeyda, a legendary tale in the manner of Gold|&s;mith, and al&s;o "Poems on various Subjects," in two duodecimo volumes. The touching &s;implicity which is characteri&s;tic of true poetry, is, in the&s;e wretched pieces, &s;upplied by a plain pro&s;aic dic|tion, which is as remote as po&s;&s;ible from it. After this unfortunate attempt, Mr. Thelwall did not &s;eek the pre&s;s again till the year 1794, when No. I. of his Political Lectures made its appearance. In the following year he publi&s;hed "The Natural and Con&s;titutional Right of Britons to Annual Parlia|ments, Univer&s;al Suffrage, and the Freedom of Po|pular A&s;&s;ociation," the Speech which he intended to have delivered on his trial. His &s;ub&s;equent pro|ductions have been "Sober Reflections on the Se|ditious and Inflammatory Letter of the Rt. Hon. Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord;" "Strike but Hear!!!" a pamphlet; an Appeal to Popular, Opinion re&s;pecting the Proceedings at Yarmouth; "The Rights of Nature again&s;t the U&s;urpations of E&s;tabli&s;hments," in two parts; a particular Account of the Outrages at Lynn and Wi&s;beach; "Demo|cracy Vindicated," con&s;i&s;ting of Walter Moyl&egrave;'s E&s;&s;ay on the Con&s;titution and Government of the Roman State, with a Preface and Notes by Mr. Thelwall; "The Retort Courteous to Ma&s;ter
<PB N="304" REF="305">
Burke;" and the Peripatetic, in three volumes, duo|decimo. His writings abound in common-place ob&s;ervations, and &s;ometimes, in mo&s;t offen&s;ive, petu|lant &s;currility.</P>

During the late war between the Colonies and the mother Country, he rai&s;ed a regiment of American Dragoons, and &s;ig|nali&s;ed him&s;elf on many occa&s;ions during the heat of that conte&s;t. In 1784, by his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, he engaged him&s;elf in the &s;ervice of his Serene Highne&s;s the Elector Palatine, Reigning Duke of Bavaria, and was employed in various public &s;ervices, particularly in arranging his military af|fairs,
<PB N="305" REF="306">
and in introducing a new &s;y&s;tem of order, dicipline, and oeconomy among his troops. He al&s;o formed e&s;tabli&s;hments for the relief of the poor at Munich, furni&s;hed them with employment, &s;ug|ge&s;ted many plans for providing them with food at &s;mall expence, and, by various experiments, enabled them to abridge their con&s;umption of fuel. In pur&s;uing the&s;e enquiries, he made &s;ome valuable di&s;coveries in the con&s;truction of Chimneys; and was enabled to point out means, which have &s;ince been &s;ucce&s;sfully put in practice in this country al&s;o, of increa&s;ing the heat, and, at the &s;ame time, decrea&s;ing the quantity of fuel. Count Rumford, moreover, introduced manufactures into Munich, until then unknown; and was the mean of fami|liarizing the u&s;e of the Potatoe in Germany. The honours which he has received from his new ma&s;|ter the Elector are of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The publications of Count Rumford have been confined to his Experimental E&s;&s;ays, Political, Oeconomical, and Philo&s;ophical, &s;even of which have been publi&s;hed in octavo pamphlets.

<HEAD>TOOKE, JOHN, HORNE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>This celebrated character was formerly, while he bore the &s;irname of Horne, a member of St. John's College, Cambridge, and afterward a Clergyman of Brentford in Middle&s;ex. He took a very active part in the election canvas of Mr. Wilkes, at the me|morable period of 1768; and was deeply concerned with Me&s;&s;rs. Glynn, Sawbridge, Oliver, Town&s;end, Bellas, Vaughan, &amp;c. in the &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures, for the &s;upport of Mr. Wilkes' cau&s;e, and in the in|&s;titution of the Society of the Bill of Rights. An accu&s;ation having been brought again&s;t Mr. Wilkes, that he &s;trove to engro&s;s the whole &s;ub&s;cription money of this &s;ociety to him&s;elf, and that he would not permit the other &s;ufferers in the cau&s;e of liberty to &s;hare in its benefits, Mr. Horne together with many others, de&s;erted his political leader, and a new&s;paper controver&s;y, &s;oon afterward, broke out between the&s;e two gentleman, in which they very liberally accu&s;ed each other of roguery and &s;windling, about an <HI>important</HI> affair of a Welch poney, and a packet of foul linen. Mr. Horne al&s;o entered the li&s;ts with the celebrated JUNIUS, a con|te&s;t
<PB N="314" REF="315">
in which the political divine is commonly thought to have come off &s;econd-be&s;t. While Mini&s;ter of New Brentford, he publi&s;hed in the year 1796, a &s;ingle Sermon on the precarious tenure of human friend|&s;hip; and, in the year following, an Oration which he delivered at a numerous Meeting of the Free|holders of Middle&s;ex, at Mile-end A&s;&s;embly Room, March 30th, 1770, to con&s;ider of an Addre&s;s, Re|mon&s;trance, and Petition to his Maje&s;ty. It is probable that the manner in which he had embroiled him&s;elf in political di&s;pute, and the con&s;picuous and improper part which he had acted, were his in|ducements to the re&s;ignation of his gown. Since that time he has made him&s;elf a mo&s;t con&s;picuous champion of republicani&s;m. In the year 1777, he was tried for a libel, in having charged the King's troops with murdering the American &s;oldiery at Lexington and Bunker's Hill. He &s;ubpoenaed Lord George Sackville and, &s;everal of the King's Mini&s;ters, who did not think it proper to an&s;wer his &s;ummons; and, having undertaken to plead his own cau&s;e, he delivered a &s;peech three hours in length, full of ingenuity, argument, and &s;hrewdne&s;s. This &s;peech, printed in the State Trials, is highly creditable to his talents, as a con&s;titutional lawyer.</P>
<P>Mr. Horne was, at this time, preparing him&s;elf for the bar; but objections were rai&s;ed to exclude him from the profe&s;&s;ion he had cho&s;en, and in &s;e|veral attempts which he made to addre&s;s his old audiences of freeholders and others, he was con|&s;tantly
<PB N="315" REF="316">
overborne and &s;ilenced. The native energy of his mind enabled him to find a con&s;olation amid the&s;e di&s;appointments in the pur&s;uits of literature and having applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of Univer&s;al Grammar, the fir&s;t fruit of his labour appeared in a Letter to Mr. John Dunning (Lord A&s;hburton) publi&s;hed in 1777. This pamphlet, now become very &s;carce, is the &s;keleton of his &s;ub&s;equent cele|brated work on this &s;ubject, to be noticed here|after; and it is &s;aid Dr. John&s;on thought &s;o well of it, that he told a friend, if he ever printed a new edition of his dictionary, he &s;hould adopt many of Mr. Horne's etymologies of the conjunctions. Five years after this he publi&s;hed a Letter to Lord A&s;h|burton on Parliamentary Reform, which was re|printed by Ridgway in 1794. Mr. Horne a&s;&s;umed the &s;irname of Tooke in the year 1782, in con&s;e|quence of the will of Andrew Tooke E&s;q. a gentle|man who bequeathed him an e&s;tate; and in 1786 he publi&s;hed celebrated etymological work, entitled, <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Diver&s;ions of Purley, in an octavo volume. The&s;e WINGED WORDS obtained the above title from Purley near Croydon, at that time the re&s;idence of the author, and formerly the &s;eat of Pre&s;ident Brad&s;haw. In this work Mr. Tooke has pointed out, and has him&s;elf proceeded far in, a path before untrodden, and evidently leading to improve|ments, by which the &s;cience of grammar may be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a &s;ure ba&s;is. It has been highly ad|mired, and is conceived by the generality of its rea|ders
<PB N="316" REF="317">
to have totally demoli&s;hed the &s;y&s;tem of Mr. James Harris of Sali&s;bury, who had long &s;hared in profu&s;ion the compliments of the literari. A con|tinuation of his grammatical re&s;earches has been promi&s;ed to the world; and we have under&s;tood that "The Diver&s;ions of Purley," are reprinting in quarto. In the year 1787, Mr. Tooke publi&s;hed an extraordinary Letter in defence of Mrs. Fitzherbert, under the idea of her being the lawful con&s;ort of the Prince of Wales; and in the year following "Two pair of Portraits," a pamphlet, exhibiting, in the painter's own &s;tyle, the late Lords Chatham and Holland, and their &s;ons Me&s;&s;rs Pitt and Fox.</P>
<P>Mr. Tooke di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;ome years ago as the &s;trenuous parti&s;an of Lord Hood in the We&s;t|min&s;ter Election. In 1792 an action of debt, foun|ded on the &s;tatute 28 Geo III. c. 52, was brought again&s;t him by Mr. Fox for the &s;um of &pound; 198 2<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> the taxed amount of Mr. Fox's expences, incurred in defending him&s;elf again&s;t the memorable petition pre&s;ented by Mr. Tooke to the Hou&s;e of Commons. The verdict of the Jury was, with great deliberation and ju&s;tice, in favour of the plaintiff, and Mr. Tooke him&s;elf publi&s;hed an account of the proceed|ings. Being a very active Member of the Corre|&s;ponding Society, he was taken into cu&s;tody in May 1794, by a warrant from the Secretary of State, on &s;u&s;picion, of High Trea&s;on, and was afterward com|mitted to the Tower. His trial came on at the Se&s;|&s;ions Hou&s;e in the Old Baily, the November follow|ing
<PB N="317" REF="318">
together with tho&s;e of Hardy, Thelwall, &amp;c. and ended in his acquittal.

Not having any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf upon the hu&s;tings with deriding Sir Alan Gardner before an ignorant unprincipled mob!</P>
<P>However unpopular Mr. Tooke may have made him&s;elf with the better part of mankind by the di&s;|tinction he has aimed at as a Philo&s;opher of the New Sect, he is certainly entitled to the credit of fir&s;t-rate abilities. His &s;tyle is clear and nervous, and the acutene&s;s of his intellect has &s;eldom been equalled. As a Scholar and Philologi&s;t his fame will probably live while our language exi&s;ts; and even as a Politician it has been &s;aid for him, that he is one of the few of his day who&s;e conduct has been uniformly con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>WAKEFIELD, GILBERT, B.A.</HEAD>
<P>Of Hackney. A very di&s;tingui&s;hed Cla&s;&s;ical Scholar: formerly a clergyman of the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, at pre&s;ent, a di&s;&s;enting layman. Mr. Wakefield was born at Nottingham, in 1756, his father being then Rector of St. Nicholas, in that
<PB N="348" REF="349">
town. He was educated at the Free-&s;chool, Not|tingham; under the Rev. Richard Woodde&s;on, of King&s;ton-upon-Thames; and at Je&s;us College, Cambridge: having, in his earlie&s;t infancy, di&s;co|vered that ardent de&s;ire of knowledge, which, from his uncea&s;ing application, appears never to have been impaired. At the "Univer&s;ity Mr. Wakefield cultivated u&s;eful learning with great &s;ucce&s;s; and, on his admi&s;&s;ion to the degree of B. A. in 1776, received di&s;tingui&s;hed honours for his mathematical, as well as for his cla&s;&s;ical at|tainments. Soon after this he was elected Fellow of Je&s;us College; and, in 1778, was ordained a deacon. Mr. Wakefield was even then &s;o little &s;atisfied with the requi&s;ition of <HI>&s;ub&s;cription,</HI> and with the &s;ubjects of that &s;ub&s;cription them&s;elves, that, as he properly confe&s;&s;es in the MEMOIRS of his own Life, he has &s;ince regarded this acquie&s;cence as an action highly di&s;ingenuous. While he held his &s;tation in the Church, which has now for many years been relinqui&s;hed, he was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, for a &s;hort time, curate of Stockport in Che&s;hire, and of St. Peter's and St. Paul's in Liverpool. In the year 1779, he removed to Warrington in Lan|ca&s;hire, to accept the office of Cla&s;&s;ical Tutor at the di&s;&s;enting Academy in that town. Here Mr. Wakefield remained until the di&s;&s;olution of that &s;eminary, in 1783, when he removed to Bramcote near Nottingham, with a view of receiving pupils; and, after a &s;hort re&s;idence at this place, and at
<PB N="349" REF="350">
Richmond, lived for &s;ome years at Nottingham, in the &s;ame occupation. In 1790, he was cho&s;en Cla&s;&s;ical Tutor of the New College, Hackney; &s;ince which time, that town has been the place of his re&s;idence. His connexion with the college ended a year after his acceptance of his office, and his &s;ub&s;equent days have been &s;pent in a diligent pro&s;ecution of his &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Mr. Wakefield commenced author in the year 1776; when he printed, at the Cambrige pre&s;s <HI>Poemata Latine partim Scripta partim Reddita,</HI> with a few critical Ob&s;ervations on Horace, in a &s;mall quarto volume. Although he has &s;ince di&s;covered one <HI>fal&s;e quantity</HI> in the&s;e poems, they do him great credit as a very elegant &s;cholar at an early age. His next publication was a new Tran&s;lation of St. Paul's fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians, ac|companied by &s;uch notes as were nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify his variations from the e&s;tabli&s;hed ver&s;ion. This was publi&s;hed in 1781, and experienced a favourable reception. His numerous &s;ub&s;equent publications followed each other at no very con|&s;iderable intervals of time, in nearly the following order, viz. an E&s;&s;ay on In&s;piration, con&s;idered chiefly with re&s;pect to the Evangeli&s;ts; a &s;hort Treati&s;e on Bapti&s;m; a new Tran&s;lation of St. Matthew, with Notes, critical, philological, and explanatory, in a quarto volume; Vol. I.

<P>It was the intention of Mr. Wakefield, had not the &s;ources of academical favour ben dried up, to have carried on his <HI>Silva Critica</HI> through the whole compa&s;s of ancient literature; uniting theological and cla&s;&s;ical learning, and illu&s;trating the &s;criptures by light borrowed from the philology of Greece and Rome. His Tran&s;lation of the New Te&s;tament is a very valuable performance; his edition of Pope's Illiad and Ody&s;&s;ey, a very complete and elegant publication; and his edition of Lucretius, upon the large paper, the hand&s;ome&s;t book we almo&s;t ever recollect to have &s;een. He has al&s;o written, be&s;ide the pieces already enumerated, a very ma&s;terly E&s;&s;ay on the Origin of Alphabetical Characters, which was read to the Literary and Phi|lo&s;ophical Society of Manche&s;ter at two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive meetings, was the more immediate occa&s;ion of his being elected an honorary member of that Society, and has been in&s;erted in the New Annual Regi&s;ter, and in the Scotch Encyclopaedia. It is likewi&s;e to be found, with additions and improvements, in the Memoirs of his Life. Mr. Wakefield is al&s;o an oc|ca&s;ional
<PB N="353" REF="354">
contributor to the Monthly and Gentle|man's Magazines. To the former he, not long ago, &s;ent two Letters particularly remarkable, in which he endeavours to do away a prejudice of con&s;iderable &s;trength and &s;tanding re&s;pecting the elegance of the &s;tyle of Hume.</P>
<P>In contemplating Mr. Wakefield's General Cha|racter as an author, the fir&s;t and highe&s;t commenda|tion is due to his remarkable indu&s;try. It is this active principle that has enabled him, with a re|pectable &s;hare of talent, to &s;erve the true&s;t intere&s;ts of u&s;eful letters, with far greater effect than has commonly fallen to the lot of fir&s;t-rate genius. His knowledge of Greek and Roman authors is ex|ten&s;ive and accurate; and as a critic he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;pirit mo&s;t penetrating and ardent. As an emen|dator he is frequently ingenious, but, certainly, for the greater part, too bold. His Latin &s;tyle as he him&s;elf acknowledges, &s;avours more of the ex|pre&s;&s;ive energy of Quintilian, than of the magnifi|cent volubility of Cicero. It is not a little &s;urpri|&s;ing, and particularly to be lamented for the &s;ake of Mr. Wakefield's credit, that, with &s;uch peculiar faculties for the enjoyment of cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies, he &s;hould ever have for&s;aken that flowery path to &s;hare the grovelling walks of writers, infinitely his inferiors; relinqui&s;hing the loftie&s;t di&s;tinctions of literary character, for a pitiful di&s;play of party-&s;pi|rit, or peculiarity of opinion. Some of his con|trover&s;ial writings, theological as well as political,
<PB N="354" REF="355">
are peculiarly indecent for their violence and illi|berality; and his di&s;po&s;ition appears, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, to &s;uch di&s;advantage that his unpopula|rity &s;eems a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. His Engli&s;h &s;tyle is always manly and graceful, and, &s;ometimes, peculiarly elegant and energetic: mo&s;t readers will, however, object to his &s;uperabundant u&s;e of cla&s;&s;ical quotations. His numerous writings have for the greater part experienced an indifferent re|ception, and &s;ome of them, particuliarly the earlier ones, have been &s;everely handled by the critics of their day.</P>

It is to be recorded to the credit of Dr. Wal|cot's benevolence as well as di&s;cernment, that the art of painting is indebted to him for Mr. Opie. That arti&s;t was found by him in the Mines of Corn|wall, where his genius fir&s;t di&s;covered it&s;elf to the Doctor, and he was encouraged by him to tru&s;t for his future fortune to the cultivation of his intel|lectual capability.</P>

<HEAD>WARTON, REV. JOSEPH, D.D. F.R.S.</HEAD>
<P>Warden of Winche&s;ter College, and brother to the late celebrated poet laureat. A literary veteran of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction. We believe the earlie&s;t of his publications was an Ode on reading We&s;t's Pindar, which appeared in 1749, and has been fol|lowed by &s;ome other &s;hort poetical pieces, among which is the Enthu&s;ia&s;t, or Lover of Nature. A year or two after the above date, he fir&s;t publi&s;hed, in four volumes, octavo, the edition of Virgil, com|monly known by the name of WARTON's AND PITT's VIRGIL; adding to Virgil's original text
<PB N="367" REF="368">
and Mr. Pitt's tran&s;lation of the Aeneid, a new tran&s;lation of the Eclogues and Georgics with Notes on the whole by him&s;elf, and di&s;&s;ertations E&s;|&s;ays &amp;c. by him&s;elf and others. This edition of Virgil has been reprinted in four duodecimo vo|lumes, as well as in octavo; and bears a very re|&s;pectable e&s;timation among learned men. With the merit of Mr. Pitt's Ver&s;ion of the Aeneid the world is well acquainted. Of Dr. Warton's Eclo|gues and Georgics it may be &s;aid, that they con|vey the &s;en&s;e of their originals with greater exact|ne&s;s and per&s;picuity than any other tran&s;lation we have; that their ve&s;ification is ea&s;y and harmonious and their &s;tyle correct and pure: yet, if read for them&s;elves, they are inferior as plea&s;ing poems to the &s;imilar performances of Dryden. About the &s;ame time with this publication, appeared al&s;o the fir&s;t volume (in octavo) of Dr. Warton's cele|brated E&s;&s;ay on the Genius and Writings of Pope. It was publi&s;hed anonymou&s;ly, and the &s;econd vo|lume did not make its appearance till 1782, though part of it was printed nearly twenty years before that time. This work, though not always in harmony with later opinions, is abundantly gratifying on ac|count of its learning, information, and ju&s;t ta&s;te. In 1797, Dr. Warton committed to the public the labour, as it is &s;aid, of &s;ixteen years, in his long looked-for Edition of the Works of Pope, printed in in nine octavo volumes. The expectation which this work had excited in the literary world, was, in
<PB N="368" REF="369">
&s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;appointed on its appearance. It is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t books which the modern elegance of typography has produced; but it is deformed by marks of ha&s;te, unpardonable in &s;uch an undertaking, and the commentary is little more than a &s;election of the be&s;t of Warburton's notes, combined with the corre&s;ponding parts of the edi|tor's before-mentioned ESSAY. Yet, though not &s;o excellent a work of the kind as might be wi&s;hed for, it is certainly the be&s;t edition of Pope we have!</P>

<P>Lord Bi&s;hop of Landaff, Archdeacon of Ely, Rector of Car&s;til in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and Regius Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Divinity in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge. A prelate di&s;tingui&s;hed for his various and exten&s;ive learning. His Lord&s;hip was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, was admitted to the degree of B. A. with di&s;tingui&s;hed credit, in the year 1759, afterward became Prefe&s;&s;or of Chemi&s;try in the Univer&s;ity, and was elected to his pre&s;ent Pro|fe&s;&s;or&s;hip in 1771. During a re&s;idence of more than thirty years, he remained the glory of his Uni|ver&s;ity; at one time, by the ingenuity of his che|mical re&s;earches; at another, as the pride of her divinity-chair. Of his Lord&s;hip's publications, the fir&s;t was <HI>In&s;titutiones Metallurgicae,</HI> a tract, printed
<PB N="370" REF="371">
at Cambridge, in 1768, and intended as a text|book for that part of his chemical lectures, which explained the properties of metallic &s;ub&s;tances. He wrote &s;ix more chemical tracts during his re&s;i|dence in the Univer&s;ity, the greater part of which appeared in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions; and they were all afterward reprinted in the fifth volume of his Chemical E&s;&s;ays. His Lord&s;hip next publi&s;hed an A&s;&s;ize Sermon, preached at Cambridge, in 1769: which was followed by two Sermons preached at the &s;ame place, in the year 1776, the publica|tion of which fir&s;t made him known beyond the precincts of the Univer&s;ity; one of them, entitled, "The Principles of the Revolution vindicated," de|livered on the 29th of May; the other on the An|niver&s;ary of his Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion in that year. The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, according to the &s;entiments of their re&s;pective readers, were &s;ubjects of high commendation on one &s;ide, and of &s;evere di&s;appro|bation on the other. In the &s;ame year Dr. Wat&s;on al&s;o publi&s;hed, "An Apology for Chri&s;tianity." a duodecimo volume, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;eries of letters to Mr. Gibbon; which, of all the an&s;wers made to the attacks of that gentleman, was the mo&s;t libe|ral, the mo&s;t elegant, and, perhaps, the mo&s;t for|cible. It is &s;eldom, indeed, that controver&s;y has been conducted with &s;o much becoming urbanity, and, at the &s;ame time, with &s;o much &s;pirit, as upon this occa&s;ion. In 1780, Dr. Wat&s;on pub|li&s;hed a Sermon, preached before the Univer&s;ity
<PB N="371" REF="372">
on the General Fa&s;t, Feb. 4th, which was greatly admired; and al&s;o a Di&s;cour&s;e delivered to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Ely. The year following produced the two fir&s;t volumes (in duo|decimo) of tho&s;e "Chemical E&s;&s;ays" which have been &s;o highly approved, and to which three more volumes were afterward added. They were writ|ten, not with a view of giving a Sy&s;tem of Che|mi&s;try to the world, but to convey, in a popular manner, a general kind of knowledge to per&s;ons not much ver&s;ed in chemical enquiries.</P>
<P>Having been tutor to the late Duke of Rutland, while His Grace re&s;ided at Cambridge, Dr. Wat&s;on was appointed, through the intere&s;t of the Rut|land family, under the admini&s;tration of the Mar|quis of Lan&s;down, in 1782, to the Bi&s;hopric of Landaff. Immediately upon his promotion, his Lord&s;hip publi&s;hed a Letter to the (late) Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, recommending a new di&s;po|&s;ition of the church revenues, by which the Bi|&s;hoprics &s;hould be rendered equal to each other in value, and the &s;maller livings be &s;o far increa&s;ed in income, by a proportional deduction from the richer endowments, as to render them a decent competency. This letter produced &s;everal pam|phlets at the pre&s;s, among which was a Letter to the Bi&s;hop from Mr. Richard Cumberland (vide that name). Dr. Wat&s;on's &s;ub&s;equent publica|tions have been, be&s;ide a few occa&s;ionial &s;ingle Ser|mons, a valuable Collection of Theological Tracts,
<PB N="372" REF="373">
in &s;ix large octavo volumes, publi&s;hed in 1785; an octavo volume of Sermons and Tracts, publi&s;hed in 1788, and con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of his &s;maller pieces which had been publi&s;hed &s;eparately before that time, as already enumerated; three Charges deli|vered to the Clergy of the Dioce&s;e of Landaff; an Addre&s;s to young Per&s;ons after Confirmation, a pamphlet, which had been annexed to the fir&s;t of his Charges; Con&s;iderations on the Expediency of Revi&s;ing the Liturgy and Articles of the Church of England, a pamphlet, publi&s;hed in 1790; and "An Apology for the Bible," in an&s;wer to Paine's AGE OF REASON, Part II.

<P>Rector of Ruan Lanyhorne, in the County of Cornwall, and formerly Fellow of Corpus Chri&s;ti College, Oxford. A very ingenious, learned, and energetic writer. His fir&s;t publication was a Hi&s;|tory of Manche&s;ter, in two volumes, quarto, the fir&s;t of which appeared in 1771. It is writen upon a very elaborate plan, but has obtained many ad|mirers, both as a work of ingenuity and acutene&s;s,
<PB N="377" REF="378">
and of elegance and imagination. In 1772, Mr. Whitaker publi&s;hed "The genuine Hi&s;tory of the Britons a&s;&s;erted," an octavo volume, in refutation of Macpher&s;on's INTRODUCTION TO THE HIS|TORY OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND; and in which he di&s;played an evident &s;uperiority over his adver&s;ary. His next publication was a &s;mall octavo volume of Sermons upon Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell, which was printed in 1783, and has been generally thought to have added little to his reputation as an author. This was followed in 1787, by his three octavo volumes, entitled, "Mary Queen of Scots vindicated," which clo&s;ed the controver&s;y re&s;pecting that Prince&s;s, by a vindi|cation of her innocence. Although Mr. Whitaker had been preceded on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;|tion, by the re&s;earches of Mr. Goodal, the acute|ne&s;s of Mr. Tytler, and, above all, by the genius of Dr. Gilbert Stuart, he found means to di&s;cover &s;ome new materials for the defence of his heroine. The <HI>matter,</HI> indeed, of this publication is excellent throughout, but the <HI>manner</HI> is often highly repre|hen&s;ible. The &s;ub&s;equent productions of Mr. Whit|aker have been, a Review of Mr. Gibbon's Hi&s;tory, Vols. IV. V. and VI. which had originally ap|peared in the Engli&s;h Review; "The Origin of Ariani&s;m di&s;clo&s;ed," a large controver&s;ial tract in which there is an uncommon di&s;play of learning and judgement; "The Cour&s;e of Hannibal over the Alps a&s;certained," a very curious inve&s;tigation, in
<PB N="378" REF="379">
two octavo volumes; and "The real Origin of Go|vernment," a very &s;ingular pamphlet. Mr. Whit|aker was al&s;o a very material contributor to the re|putation which the Engli&s;h Review could, at one time, boa&s;t; and has written &s;ome Poems in the Collection publi&s;hed by Gentlemen of Devon&s;hire and Cornwall. His vices as a writer are, a general inequality, and an occa&s;ional appearance of exce&s;|&s;&s;ive affectation, in his &s;tyle; too &s;trong a propen|&s;ity to conjectural rea&s;oning; and, &s;ometimes, too apparent a &s;elf-&s;atisfaction in his own performances.

He next printed a Sermon, recommending a Revi|&s;al of the Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation of the Old Te&s;tament, preached before the Univer&s;ity in 1778; which was &s;oon afterward followed by an edition of the Sy|riac Philoxenian Ver&s;ion of the four Go&s;pels, in a quarto volume, with a Latin Tran&s;lation, by him|&s;elf. In 1780, Dr. White pre&s;ented the Public with "A Specimen of the Civil and Military In&s;ti|tutes of Timour, or Tamerlane," a work, written originally by that celebrated conqueror in the Mo|gul Language, afterward tran&s;lated into Per&s;ian, and rendered from the Per&s;ian into Engli&s;h, by the Doctor, from a MS. in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dr. Wil|liam Hunter.

Dr. White was openly attacked with a charge to this purpo&s;e, by Dr. Gabriel of the Octagon Chapel, Bath; and a literary controver&s;y en&s;ued which produced &s;everal pamphlets at the pre&s;s. Dr. White was, at length, induced to publi&s;h a &s;tatement of the ca&s;e, by which it appeared that literary and pecuniary obli|gations had reciprocally &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Mr. Badcock and him&s;elf; and that the Sermons had received additional brilliancy from the ma&s;terly pen of Dr. Parr.

<P>A native of Glamorgan&s;hire. He was originally a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter at Exeter and afterward preached for many years to a &s;mall congregation at Highgate. Here he changed his principles, and,
<PB N="385" REF="386">
being &s;u&s;pected, relinqui&s;hed the mini&s;terial charge and adopted that of private tuition. While at Highgate, he preached a cour&s;e of Sermons on Re|ligious Hypocri&s;y, which he publi&s;hed in two duo|decimo volumes. In 1770, he wrote a poignant Letter to Mr. Garrick, on his conduct and talents, as manager and performer; which was followed by polemical dialogues, entitled "The Philo&s;opher." When the Unitarian Clergy met at the Feathers Tavern to petition relief from &s;ub&s;cribing the Arti|cles, the able pen of Mr. Williams was &s;olicited in their &s;ervice; he accordingly drew up &s;ome E&s;&s;ays on Public Wor&s;hip, Projects of Reformation, &amp;c. which were found to contain &s;entiments of &s;o DEISTICAL a complexion that he was, at once, for|&s;aken by the people whom he had de&s;igned to &s;erve. The&s;e E&s;&s;ays he publi&s;hed, and afterward added to them an Appendix, principally levelled at the Di&s;&s;enters, upon who&s;e conduct he was pe|culiarly &s;evere. Mr. Williams now totally for&s;ook the connection of the Di&s;&s;enters, and became an avowed advocate of dei&s;m, as well as of democracy. In 1774, the time of his e&s;tabli&s;hing a private &s;e|minary at Chel&s;ea, he publi&s;hed a Treati&s;e on Edu|cation, in a duodecimo volume, which contains &s;ome uncommonly acute and judicious remarks on that &s;ubject, while it too fully di&s;clo&s;es the change in his principles with re&s;pect to revealed religion. Two years after this date, Mr. Williams opened a Chapel in Margaret Street, Cavendi&s;h Square, on
<PB N="386" REF="387">
the univer&s;al principles of Natural Religion, a &s;cheme to which he was in&s;tigated by Dr. Franklin.

Be&s;ide the works already mentioned, he has publi&s;hed a Sermon, preached at the opening of his Chapel in Margaret Street; a Liturgy for that Chapel; "The Na|ture and Extent of Intellectual Liberty," a pam|phlet; a Plan of A&s;&s;ociation on Con&s;titutional Principles, a pamphlet written at the time of the riots in London; Letters on Political Liberty, oc|ca&s;ioned by the county meetings and a&s;&s;ociations in 1782; Lectures on Religion and Morality, in two volumes, quarto; Lectures on Education, in three volumes, octavo; Lectures on Political Prin|ciples, in an octavo volume; and a Hi&s;tory of Monmouth&s;hire, in a quarto volume.

<HEAD>YOUNG, ARTHUR, ESQ. F.R.S.</HEAD>
<P>Secretary to the Board of Agriculture, Hono|rary Member of &s;everal Societies at home and abroad, and a writer chiefly con&s;picuous on Agri|cultural Subjects. Mr. Young was born at Brad|field in E&s;&s;ex, being a younger &s;on of a good family re&s;ident on that &s;pot for nearly two centuries. He began his farming pur&s;uits upon the land which he, at pre&s;ent, occupies, about the year 1761; re|&s;ided afterward, for nine years, in Hertford&s;hire, and then returned to his native place. In the years 1776-1779, he made journies to Ireland; and, on an invitation from M. Lazow&s;ki, to accompany him and Count de la Rochefoucauld to the Pyre|nees, made his fir&s;t journey into France in 1787. Mr. Young returned to England in the winter of the &s;ame year, and attended the Wool Bill then before our Parliament, after which he made a &s;e|cond tour to France, and fini&s;hed his travels in 1789.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Young's publications, the fir&s;t was an octavo volume, entitled, "The Farmer's Letters, &amp;c." which appeared in 1767, and to which a &s;e|cond volume was, &s;ome years afterward, added. His &s;ub&s;equent productions have been, "A &s;ix weeks Tour through the Southern Counties of Eng|land and Wales," in an octavo volume; an E&s;&s;ay
<PB N="402" REF="403">
on the Management of Hogs; a &s;ix-months Tour through the North of England, in four volumes, octavo; the Farmer's Guide in Hiring and Stock|ing Farms, in two volumes, octavo; "Rural Oeco|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">my," an octavo volume; a Cour&s;e of Experi|mental Agriculture, in two volumes, quarto; the Farmer's Tour through the Ea&s;t of England, in four volumes, octavo; "Political Arithmetic," Parts I. and II. pamphlets; a Tour in Ireland, fir&s;t publi&s;hed in a quarto volume, and afterward reprinted in two volumes, octavo; Annals of Agri|culture, in ten volumes, octavo; Travels in France, in two volumes, quarto; "The Example of France a Warning to Britain," an excellent and highly &s;ea&s;onable pamphlet, publi&s;hed in 1793, and which was the origin of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our Yeomanry Cavalry; an Idea of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> State of France, a pamphlet, publi&s;hed in 1795; and "The Con&s;titution Safe without Reform,' a pamphlet.</P>
<P>Though the agricultural pur&s;uits of Mr. Young have been highly laudable, his publications in this cla&s;s have not been flattered with a recep|tion peculiarly kind, and his judgement on tho&s;e &s;ubjects has been frequently di&s;approved. In <HI>poli|tical arithmetic</HI> he has de&s;ervedly gained con&s;iderable eminence; and his TRAVELS in France, in which his pur&s;uit was not agriculture, but political oeco|nomy, have been very eagerly read and highly approved.</P>
