<HEAD>CHAP. I. Conjectures concerning the Exi&s;tence of Old Maids before the Deluge.</HEAD>
<P>A DUTCH author, di&s;tingui&s;hed by his erudition and his misfortunes, has endeavoured to prove, in a di&s;&s;ertation of more learning than mode&s;ty, that, when our progenitors were fir&s;t created, it was the intention of Heaven, that Eve her&s;elf &s;hould become an Old Maid; and that
<PB N="2" REF="4">
original &s;in was introduced into the world by the di&s;obedience of our frail mother, not literally in eating a my&s;terious fruit, but in wandering from the path of virgin purity. This fanciful hypothe&s;is did not ari&s;e in the heavy air of Holland&mdash;the idea was entertained by &s;ome illu&s;trious fa|thers of the church; and the great living hi&s;torian of the Roman empire, in tho&s;e &s;arca&s;tic remarks on Chri&s;tianity, which are the only blemi&s;h in his exqui&s;ite compo&s;i|tion, has ob&s;erved,
<Q>it was their favourite opinion, that if Adam had pre&s;erved his obedience to the Creator, he would have lived and died in a &s;tate of virgin purity, and that &s;ome harmle&s;s mode of vegeta|tion might have peopled Paradi&s;e with a race of innocent and immortal beings.</Q>
In a note to this pa&s;&s;age, the great hi&s;torian informs us, that
<Q>Ju&s;tin, Gregory of Ny&s;&s;a, Augu&s;tin, &amp;c. &s;trongly inclined to this opinion;</Q>
but he has not attended, with his u&s;ual accuracy, to the idea entertained by the la&s;t of the&s;e fathers on this curious
<PB N="3" REF="5">
point. Augu&s;tin, in the 14th book of his City of God, enters into a long and rather indelicate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it. He affirms, that Paradi&s;e would have been peopled, not by <HI>a harmle&s;s mode of vegetation,</HI> but by an ac|tual intercour&s;e between the &s;exes, yet un|&s;timulated by any wanton or pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire; and, as a proof that man might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this perfect command over his innocent frame, the good father, and his learned commentator Lodovicus Vives, al|ledge the mo&s;t whim&s;ical and ludicrous oc|currences that were ever recorded by a &s;e|rious pen. The curious reader may find the&s;e extraordinary anecdotes related in very coar&s;e but explicit language, at the 498th page of the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of St. Augu&s;tin, printed in 1620. I ought, per|haps, like the holy father him&s;elf, when &s;peaking of matters much more indecent, to a&s;k the pardon of cha&s;te eyes, for point|ing out to them &s;uch indelicate wonders; but, I flatter my&s;elf, the kind &s;i&s;terhood will forgive the coar&s;ene&s;s of the &s;tory, for
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the &s;ake of my zealous &s;olicitude to indulge their curio&s;ity. I tru&s;t I may afford them both amu&s;ement and in&s;truction, by &s;hew|ing them how &s;trangely men of the mo&s;t reverend character have been betrayed, by frivolous &s;peculation, into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Perhaps, without the &s;anctity of Au|gu&s;tin, I am now expo&s;ing my&s;elf to a &s;imi|lar cen&s;ure; but if an enquiry into antedi|luvian virginity &s;hould be con&s;idered by any moro&s;e or &s;ceptical readers as a frivo|lous &s;peculation, let them remember, that I am profe&s;&s;edly following the example of tho&s;e great antiquarians, who have a&s;to|ni&s;hed the pre&s;ent enlightened age by the profundity of their re&s;earches. The elabo|rate works of the&s;e gentlemen evidently prove, that they have two con&s;iderable and &s;eparate points to pur&s;ue; the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important, to di&s;play their own exten&s;ive erudition; the &s;econd and inferior, to in|form or to amu&s;e their reader, which, like all other &s;econdary aims, mu&s;t be frequently
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;acrificed to the more important. After the marvellous intimate acquaintance which the learned Mr. Bryant has &s;hewn with the family of Chus, the grand&s;on of Noah, every author who profe&s;&s;es to treat of an ancient in&s;titution, may be rea&s;onably ex|pected to give &s;ome account of whatever relates to it, either immediately after, or long before the deluge; and the re&s;pect which I bear to the &s;i&s;terhood makes me ambitious of &s;hewing them, that I have di|ligently ran&s;acked &s;uch memorials of pa&s;t ages, both genuine and fictitious, as I thought likely to elucidate the hi&s;tory of their long-neglected though venerable or|der: yet, as it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed privilege of authors to point out their own particular merits, and the particular failings of their brethren, let me here mode&s;tly boa&s;t of my own candour, in not endeavouring to rai&s;e the antiquity of the intere&s;ting order to which my pen is devoted, at the expence of truth; a failing that almo&s;t all my brother antiquarians may be &s;aid, I fear, to have
<PB N="6" REF="8">
learned from each other. For my own part, I wi&s;h the cha&s;te &s;i&s;terhood, in all points that concern both them&s;elves and others, to di&s;tingui&s;h rumour from fact.</P>
<P>On the&s;e principles I &s;hall proceed to tell them, that Eve her&s;elf has been &s;aid to have in&s;tituted a religious order of certain young women, who were to continue vir|gins, and to pre&s;erve unextingui&s;hed the fire, which had fallen from heaven on the &s;acrifice of Abel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Romuald Abr&eacute;g&eacute; du Tre&s;or Chronologique.</NOTE>. This cha&s;te in&s;titution is reported to have ari&s;en in the ninety-ninth year of the world. An advocate for the exi&s;tence of antediluvian cha&s;tity may appeal to an evidence of re&s;pectable autho|rity, to no le&s;s a per&s;onage than the pro|phet Enoch, the &s;eventh in a direct line from Adam. In certain fragments, &s;till pre&s;erved, of this mo&s;t early writer, we are told, that &s;ome women, in the age of this ingenious patriarch, had devoted them|&s;elves to a life of virginity: but it is pro|per
<PB N="7" REF="9">
to add, that although the compo&s;ition of Enoch is mentioned in the Epi&s;tle of St. Jude, the authenticity of the&s;e fragments has been forcibly called in que&s;tion, and, though quoted and defended by &s;ome of the fathers, yet mo&s;t modern authors of eminence, and particularly the learned Sir Walter Rawleigh, in the fir&s;t book of his Hi&s;tory of the World, &s;eem inclined to con&s;ider them as a fiction.</P>
<P>The very conci&s;e narration which Mo&s;es has given us of events before the flood, has tempted the fanciful rabbies of the Jews, and other writers on &s;acred hi&s;tory, to amu&s;e them&s;elves with the compo&s;ition of various antediluvian romances: among the mo&s;t remarkable and amu&s;ing of the&s;e, we may reckon the fable of an amorous connection between the apo&s;tate angels and the daugh|ters of men; a fable &s;o fa&s;cinating to a lively imagination, that our divine poet has introduced it, in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner, as a part of Satan's an&s;wer to Belial, in the 2d book of Paradi&s;e Regained.
<Q><PB N="8" REF="10">
<L>Before the flood, thou, with thy lu&s;ty crew,</L>
<L>Fal&s;e titled Sons of God, roaming the earth,</L>
<L>Ca&s;t wanton eyes on the daughters of men,</L>
<L>And coupled with them, and begot a race.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Ver. 179, &amp;c.</HI></BIBL></Q>
We may ob&s;erve al&s;o, that in his greater poem, this &s;ublime&s;t of bards alludes more than once to this illicit commerce
<Q>Betwixt th' angelical and human kind.</Q>
As the idea was founded on a mi&s;con&s;truc|tion of the following pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ixth chapter of Gene&s;is,
<Q>The &s;ons of God &s;aw the daughters of men, that they were fair, and they took them wives of all which they cho&s;e,</Q>
this &s;trange &s;tory has been &s;ometimes an object of the mo&s;t &s;e|rious credit; and a very learned modern divine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heidegger.</NOTE> has annexed, to his elaborate Hi&s;|tory of the Patriarchs, a di&s;&s;ertation to prove, from &s;cripture, from rea&s;on, and from the
<PB N="9" REF="11">
nature of angels, that the&s;e aetherial &s;pirits, whatever &s;hape they might a&s;&s;ume, were utterly incapable of begetting children.</P>
<P>If we might venture to con&s;ider this fa|ble as genuine hi&s;tory, we might certainly draw from it a very &s;trong argument again&s;t the exi&s;tence of antediluvian Old Maids; for, if the evil &s;pirits were per|mitted to exerci&s;e &s;uch power over the fe|males of the infant world, what fair indivi|dual could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have pre&s;erved her cha&s;tity, when both men and demons were per&s;onally engaged in its de&s;truction?</P>
<P>But, rejecting this fabulous interference of the&s;e licentious angels, and adhering to the more ju&s;t interpretation of the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory, let us now examine what we may fairly conclude on the point in que&s;tion. The family of Seth are repre&s;ented as or|derly and devout; but, as the &s;tate of the world &s;eemed to require a ha&s;ty increa&s;e of its inhabitants, it is not probable that any female, even in that &s;ober race, &s;hould have proved &s;o unrea&s;onable as to decline con|curring
<PB N="10" REF="12">
in the important work of peopling the wide wilderne&s;s of the earth. If any peculiar &s;anctity or &s;elf-denial may be &s;up|po&s;ed to have exi&s;ted, for a &s;hort time, among this more innocent divi&s;ion of the human race, it was &s;oon overpowered by the influence of the mo&s;t licentious ex|amples. The purity of the Sethites was corrupted by the temptations they found among the children of Cain; and the &s;tate of female manners at this period is very forcibly de&s;cribed in the following lines of Milton:
<Q><L>For that fair female troop thou &s;aw'&s;t, that &s;eem'd</L>
<L>Of Godde&s;&s;es &s;o blithe, &s;o &s;mooth, &s;o gay,</L>
<L>Yet empty of all good, wherein con&s;i&s;ts</L>
<L>Woman's dome&s;tic honour and chief prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Bred only and completed to the ta&s;te</L>
<L>Of lu&s;tful appetence, to &s;ing, to dance,</L>
<L>To dre&s;s, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye;</L>
<L>To the&s;e that &s;ober race of men, who&s;e lives</L>
<L>Religious titled them the &s;ons of God,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13">Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame,</L>
<L>Ignobly, to the trains and to the &s;miles</L>
<L>Of the&s;e fair athei&s;ts, and now &s;wim in joy,</L>
<L>Ere long to &s;wim at large; and laugh, for which</L>
<L>The world, ere long, a world of tears mu&s;t weep.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, Book xi. ver 614.</HI></BIBL></Q>
The&s;e ver&s;es, compared with the former quotation from Paradi&s;e Regained, afford a &s;triking proof how ingeniou&s;ly the great poet adopted the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite interpreta|tions of &s;cripture, as they happened to &s;uit his poetical purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I cannot help remarking, that although &s;ome lines in the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t quoted are &s;upremely beautiful, yet, in the clo&s;e of it, both the genius and the ju&s;tice of this in|comparable poet appear to have de&s;erted him: the puerility of expre&s;&s;ion in the two la&s;t lines is particularly unhappy; and the a&s;&s;ertion, that <HI>female wantonne&s;s</HI> was the chief cau&s;e of the deluge, appears rather
<PB N="12" REF="14">
uncandid and cruel. Let us, however, apo|logi&s;e for the noble&s;t of bards, on this oc|ca&s;ion, by ob&s;erving, that he was probably mi&s;led by his reverence for a learned and holy character, as his de&s;cription &s;eems to be borrowed from the annals of Eutychius, the patriarch of Alexandria.</P>
<P>Though I cannot &s;ub&s;cribe to this &s;eve|rity on the fir&s;t female inhabitants of the world, yet, after what I have alledged, I may venture, I think, to terminate this chapter, by a&s;&s;erting, that from every thing which a diligent enquiry can collect on this very deep and delicate que&s;tion, we have the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, there never exi&s;ted &s;uch a being as an antediluvian Old Maid.</P>
<P>Into what blind and unju&s;t conjectures are we poor mortals betrayed, when we at|tempt to e&s;timate the con&s;titution and cha|racter of our remote predece&s;&s;ors!&mdash;I had ju&s;t clo&s;ed the preceding &s;peculation again&s;t the exi&s;tence of an antediluvian Old Maid, when I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by the ar|rival
<PB N="13" REF="15">
of a packet from a learned friend, who had promi&s;ed to collect for me, in his travels over Europe and A&s;ia, every &s;crap of antiquity that could afford me any light in my maiden re&s;earches. Although the favour which I have now received from him abundantly proves, that I was gro&s;sly mi&s;taken in my conjectural account of an|tediluvian virginity, I &s;hall &s;uffer what I had written to &s;tand, as a warning to future antiquarians, not to indulge them&s;elves in &s;uch ha&s;ty deci&s;ions.</P>
<P>I cannot more &s;trongly expre&s;s my zeal for the &s;i&s;terhood, than by pre&s;enting to them, with a &s;incere delight, this very choice mor&s;el of antediluvian hi&s;tory, which de&s;troys my hypothe&s;is, and by thus a&s;&s;erting their primaeval honour, at the expence of my own hi&s;torical &s;agacity.&mdash; My friend, the learned traveller, writes me word from Spain, which he is now vi&s;iting on his return, that as &s;oon as he reaches England, he &s;hall correct for the pre&s;s a journal of his tour; that in a &s;upplement
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to his travels, he intends to in&s;ert &s;ome other ancient tracts, which he has fortu|nately re&s;cued from oblivion; that he will there recount the incidents which led to their di&s;covery, and clearly prove that the fragment, with which he has favoured me, mu&s;t have proceeded from the pen of Enoch him&s;elf. He a&s;&s;ures me, that he has &s;ent a mo&s;t faithful tran&s;lation; and that he can demon&s;trate, by unan&s;werable arguments, that this fragment was con|tained among tho&s;e very writings of Enoch which the pious Tertullian declared he had peru&s;ed, and from which the celebrated Po&s;tellus confe&s;&s;ed he had borrowed very freely, in his elaborate treati&s;e on the origin of things.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall wave all farther preface, that I may no longer detain the reader from a precious and intere&s;ting moral tale of the mo&s;t eminent author that exi&s;ted before the deluge.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>And among the ninety and three daughters of Enoch, there was none like

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><LABEL>NOTE BY THE EDITOR.</LABEL> I am inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, that the name of this in|tere&s;ting per&s;onage, Kunaza, has been mi&s;-&s;pelt, in the ha&s;te of tran&s;cription, and that it ought to be written Kanaza, which &s;ignifies, in the Arabic language, to <HI>depo&s;it as a trea&s;ure</HI>; a &s;ignification that the word might naturally acquire, from the &s;ingular hi&s;tory of the maiden, who&s;e name it originally was&mdash;as we u&s;e the verb <HI>to hector,</HI> from the old Trojan hero.</P></NOTE> Kunaza: &s;he was beautiful, but de|&s;pi&s;ed her beauty; &s;he was nimble as the deer, yet delighted not in the dance.</P>
<P>She looked with pity on tho&s;e who tru&s;ted in the fleeting plea&s;ures of the earth.</P>
<P>She &s;aw that love was poi&s;oned with jealou&s;y, and that marriage was embit|tered by &s;trife.</P>
<P>Her &s;oul was enamoured of heavenly contemplation, and &s;he &s;aid to her father,</P>
<P>O my father, permit me to live and to die a virgin! Conduct me through life by the light of thy &s;pirit, and teach me to walk with thee in the way of our Cre|ator!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">And her father rejoiced in the purity of his child; but the kindred of Kunaza held her continence in deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>They &s;aid to her, There is no plant that beareth not &s;eed, and no creature that doth not produce young:</P>
<P>Thou wilt be the only fruitle&s;s thing upon the face of the earth; and when thou departe&s;t, there will be none to la|ment thee.</P>
<P>But Kunaza di&s;regarded their &s;coffs; and in the two hundred and ninety-fir&s;t year of her age, &s;he rejected the la&s;t offer that was made to her of marriage.</P>
<P>Now it happened at this time, that the angels appointed to watch the earth for|got their duty:</P>
<P>They &s;aw that women were beautiful; and they burned with impure de&s;ires for the daughters of men:</P>
<P>They pro&s;pered in their career of un|cleanne&s;s: they made the earth a &s;cene of abomination:</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">They begot a multitude of giants; and they boa&s;ted of their enormities.</P>
<P>For Semiexas, the prince of the licen|tious angels, commanded twenty of their chiefs to appear before him:</P>
<P>And they bound them&s;elves by an oath to a&s;&s;emble together on the ninth night of every new year, and to recount, in order, the feats of their impurity.</P>
<P>And they a&s;&s;embled on the &s;ummit of a mountain, which was called Hermo|niim, or the Mountain of the Oath.</P>
<P>But the moon hid her head, and the &s;tars refu&s;ed to witne&s;s the vaunts of their uncleanne&s;s.</P>
<P>And they rejoiced in the darkne&s;s which their di&s;cour&s;e engendered, becau&s;e their deeds had been evil.</P>
<P>And Semiexas, their prince, fir&s;t re|lated the evil which he had done:</P>
<P>And Atarkuph related the evil which he had done:</P>
<P>And Arakiel related the evil which he had done:</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">And Chababiel related the evil which he had done:</P>
<P>And Sap&s;ick related the evil which he had done.</P>
<P>And of the twenty impure &s;pirits, one only continued &s;ilent, and the &s;ilent one was Pharmarus.</P>
<P>And their prince Semiexas was offend|ed by his &s;ilence, and commanded him to &s;peak.</P>
<P>And Pharmarus looked up with a look of indignant deri&s;ion, and he &s;aid:</P>
<P>Ye are &s;pirits of low ambition; ye are contented with the &s;hadow of victory, where there is no re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But I rejoice to contend with reluc|tant caprice: I delight to triumph over the coy maiden, over the maiden of much delay, and of many excu&s;es.</P>
<P>And as he &s;pake, there aro&s;e from the a&s;&s;embly of angels a noi&s;y bur&s;t of in&s;urmountable laughter.</P>
<P>The mountain was &s;haken to its ba&s;e by the &s;hout of their deri&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">And Semiexas their prince exclaimed: O Pharmarus, inventor of magic! O thou dealer in dark things! Is there verily &s;uch a maiden upon the face of the earth?</P>
<P>And Pharmarus an&s;wered, and &s;aid: O thou prince of the impa&s;&s;ioned angels, I wonder not that thou art &s;low to believe me:</P>
<P>For thou ha&s;t met with no female, that could re&s;i&s;t thy perfection. The beauty of woman has yielded unto thee, as the &s;oft air yieldeth to the imperious wing of the eagle.</P>
<P>But attend, and I will impart to you the wonderful things I have di&s;covered among the daughters of men.</P>
<P>As we our&s;elves have panted for the plea&s;ures of earth, as we have burnt for the enjoyments of corporeal exi&s;tence;</P>
<P>So has woman al&s;o had the ambition to exchange her nature, and to cloath her|&s;elf in the perfection of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>I &s;ought the embraces of Kunaza, the
<PB N="20" REF="22">
maiden daughter of Enoch; but though the prime of her youth is departed, &s;he di&s;dainfully turned from my intreaty.</P>
<P>She has renounced the delights of her nature; &s;he has determined to give her virginity to the grave. Yet in time &s;he &s;hall accede to my wi&s;hes; for I have &s;tudied the weakne&s;&s;es of woman.</P>
<P>Her principal weakne&s;&s;es are four; and I will make an experiment on the in|fluence of each.</P>
<P>I will awaken her pride; and that alone may tempt her to unite with Phar|marus.</P>
<P>I will excite her avarice; and &s;he may then be eager to give her beauty in ex|change for the glittering &s;poils of the earth.</P>
<P>I will &s;timulate her de&s;ire; and her powers of re&s;i&s;tance will melt away.</P>
<P>I will inflame her curio&s;ity; and what is there, which the maiden who thir&s;ts for a &s;ecret, will not give to obtain it?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">I &s;wear, by the &s;ubtlety of the &s;erpent, &s;he &s;hall not e&s;cape from my pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I will triumph over the coy perver&s;ity of the virgin, or I will &s;hake this round earth to its centre.</P>
<P>And the prince Semiexas an&s;wered, and &s;aid; Well ha&s;t thou &s;poken, Pharmarus, thou inventor of magic! thy &s;peech is worthy of thy&s;elf, thou dealer in occult machinations!</P>
<P>Go! and pro&s;per in thy devices! and when we next a&s;&s;emble, divert us with the relation of thy &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;poke; he di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly; and Pharmarus departed from his fel|lows.</P>
<P>He departed to employ him&s;elf alone in the evil, of which he intended to vaunt in their next meeting; but he was doomed to meet them no more.</P>
<P>And now he pondered in &s;olitude on various wiles: he exerted all the &s;ubtlety of his &s;pirit to circumvent the virgin.</P>
<P>He approached her under the gui&s;e of
<PB N="22" REF="24">
a friend; he became familiar with the maiden in the &s;hape of an in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>She li&s;tened with avidity to his know|ledge; her under&s;tanding fea&s;ted on the wonders he revealed: and it happened on a certain day, while he conver&s;ed with her on the art of divination, that Phar|marus &s;uddenly exclaimed:</P>
<P>O, Kunaza, thou art yet to learn, that on this day thy &s;i&s;ter Kezia has brought a young Anack (or giant) into the world.</P>
<P>The wonders of nature are worth the attention of the wi&s;e: let us ha&s;ten to the tent of thy &s;i&s;ter; let us examine how &s;he has improved, by her travail, the little race of the earth.</P>
<P>And Kunaza aro&s;e with Pharmarus, and &s;he ha&s;tened to the tent of her &s;i&s;ter:</P>
<P>And behold all things had happened as Pharmarus had foretold to Kunaza.</P>
<P>For Kezia, the &s;eventieth daughter of Enoch, had conceived by Semiexas, the prince of the licentious angels. She had
<PB N="23" REF="25">
brought him a male child; and this was the fir&s;t Anack that was born upon the earth.</P>
<P>And Kunaza beheld the infant, and &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed in &s;urveying its &s;ta|ture.</P>
<P>She embraced the babe with amaze|ment, and &s;he delighted in the magnitude of its limbs!</P>
<P>And &s;he delivered the babe to its mo|ther Kezia, and &s;he ob&s;erved the proud tran&s;port of the mother, in contemplating the dimen&s;ions of the child.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t temptation of Pharmarus began to work in the bo&s;om of Kunaza; and her heart &s;aid in &s;ecret to it&s;elf, How plea&s;ant a thing it mu&s;t be, to look with the eyes of a mother on the &s;miling face of a young giant!</P>
<P>And Pharmarus read all her inmo&s;t thoughts; he exulted, and burned to be alone with the virgin.</P>
<P>And he prevailed on Kunaza to walk
<PB N="24" REF="26">
abroad from the tent of her &s;i&s;ter, that he might &s;hew her &s;ome latent wonders of the creation.</P>
<P>And as he walked by the &s;ide of the maiden, he &s;trove to fan the ri&s;ing wi&s;h &s;he had felt, to experience the proud de|lights of a parent.</P>
<P>But the mind of the maiden had ar|gued with it&s;elf; and the&s;e were the dic|tates of her mind:</P>
<P>O Kunaza, make u&s;e of thy rea&s;on! and re&s;i&s;t the temptation of pride, which is founded upon folly!</P>
<P>Of the ninety and three daughters of thy father, there is not one who may not bring forth a young Anack.</P>
<P>Could&s;t thou be proud of what the mo&s;t fooli&s;h of thy &s;ex may accompli&s;h? of a work in which fools may excel?</P>
<P>O Kunaza, if thou wert de&s;tined by thy nature to feel the weakne&s;s of pride, let thy pride at lea&s;t be confined to a venial exultation in the excellence of thy &s;pirit!</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">And Pharmarus read the&s;e unuttered words in her &s;oul; and he &s;aw that &s;he would not fall by the influence of pride.</P>
<P>And he now laboured to tempt her with trea&s;ures, and to bribe her into compliance with his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>He offered her a metal, who&s;e po|li&s;hed &s;plendor &s;hould emulate the &s;un; and a &s;tone, who&s;e lu&s;tre &s;hould contend with the brilliancy of her eyes.</P>
<P>He exclaimed, O Kunaza, give thy&s;elf to Pharmarus, and he will make thee to be called the riche&s;t among women.</P>
<P>But the &s;ubtle angel could not rai&s;e for a moment the ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ion of avarice in the noble heart of Kunaza.</P>
<P>The maiden an&s;wered, and &s;aid, The true wealth of a woman is peace of &s;pirit, and her brighte&s;t ornaments are mode&s;ty and meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>And Pharmarus marvelled at her di&s;|cretion; and he was inwardly vexed with a great vexation.</P>
<P>But he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the murmur of di&s;|appointment,
<PB N="26" REF="28">
and ha&s;tily engaged in new &s;tratagems again&s;t the maiden.</P>
<P>And as he &s;till walked in conver&s;e with Kunaza, he &s;topped beneath the in|viting &s;hade of a maje&s;tic palm.</P>
<P>And he &s;aid, Thou intelligent maiden, who delighte&s;t in the hi&s;tory of the earth, attend, and I will in&s;truct thee in my&s;te|rious wonders, that relate to this tree.</P>
<P>But ob&s;erve its goodly growth; and ob&s;erve the happy creatures that &s;port within the ample &s;pace of its long-ex|tended &s;hadow!</P>
<P>And Kunaza &s;urveyed the tree; &s;he &s;aw that it was &s;upreme in beauty.</P>
<P>The ground beneath it was flowery, and fragrant as Paradi&s;e: the mo&s;t tender and lovely animals of the creation were a&s;|&s;embled in its &s;hade, and every animal was happy with its mate.</P>
<P>O Kunaza, &s;aid the fal&s;e and artful Pharmarus, I will now tell thee the ble&s;|&s;ings that belong to this &s;pot.</P>
<P>Thou beholde&s;t the fir&s;t nuptial couch
<PB N="27" REF="29">
of thy parents; it was here that Eve fir&s;t reclined, when the envy of the guardian &s;pirits had expelled her from Eden.</P>
<P>It was here that &s;he became fir&s;t ac|quainted with connubial endearment; and felt her&s;elf repaid for the paradi&s;e &s;he had left.</P>
<P>And the angel of union gave a ble&s;&s;|ing to the tree, under which the fir&s;t mo|ther reclined:</P>
<P>He ble&s;&s;ed the tree, and all the ground that extendeth under the &s;hadow thereof.</P>
<P>He ble&s;&s;ed all the creatures that &s;port around it: he ordained that every daugh|ter of woman, who reclines beneath its &s;hade, &s;hall experience unutterable joy, beyond the common joy of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>But this ble&s;&s;ing has been long for|gotten by the heedle&s;s offspring of man: it is a joyous &s;ecret re&s;erved for me to impart to my beloved.</P>
<P>So &s;pake the &s;ubtle Pharmarus; and as he &s;pake, he infu&s;ed into the wondering virgin the thrilling flame of de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">The bo&s;om of Kunaza began to heave, and her breath on a &s;udden grew &s;hort.</P>
<P>And Pharmarus exulted in his &s;ubtlety, and was preparing to complete his triumph.</P>
<P>And a piercing cry was heard from afar; and Kunaza &s;tarted up at the &s;ound.</P>
<P>She li&s;tened, and the cry redoubled; and Kunaza exclaimed, As &s;ure as we have life, it is the cry of a woman in travail!</P>
<P>And &s;he heard the &s;ound a third time; and &s;he &s;aid, Verily it is the expre&s;&s;ion of that pain, which was inflicted upon wo|man for li&s;tening to a &s;ubtle tempter:</P>
<P>It is a warning to the weak Kunaza. I thank thee, my good angel: I feel that thou ha&s;t &s;aved me from the &s;ubtlety of Pharmarus.</P>
<P>And as the virgin &s;poke, &s;he &s;prung forward, and ha&s;tened towards the place from whence the cry had proceeded.</P>
<P>And Pharmarus began to pur&s;ue her;
<PB N="29" REF="31">
but he &s;topped in his pur&s;uit, and re|flected, that the influence of his temp|tation was vani&s;hed from her frame.</P>
<P>He roamed in di&s;content about the earth; and employed him&s;elf in darker devices to en&s;nare the maiden.</P>
<P>And he &s;ent curious gifts, which he had collected from the extremities of the earth, to entice the virgin again from the tent of her father.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed to entertain her with all the latent wonders of the creation; and he drew her by magical illu&s;ion into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of a gloomy grove.</P>
<P>He appeared to her in all his fal&s;e grandeur, as the prince of magic, whom the elements obey as their lord, and to whom light and darkne&s;s are one:</P>
<P>Who&s;e word can render what exi&s;teth invi&s;ible, and make the thing which is not, appear as the thing which is.</P>
<P>And Kunaza marvelled at his powers: and he took her by the hand, and &s;aid;</P>
<P>O thou maiden of angelical &s;pirit!
<PB N="30" REF="32">
who ha&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion to dive into the my&s;|teries of the univer&s;e,</P>
<P>Li&s;ten to me! Give me thy love, and I will fill thy capacious mind with that my&s;terious knowledge for which thy heart panteth!</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t upbraided me, that I &s;eek to deceive thee; and thou ha&s;t mentioned the example of thy parent Eve:</P>
<P>But I will &s;hew thee thou deceive&s;t thy&s;elf, if thou ha&s;t courage to learn the real truth from the dead.</P>
<P>Tell me, thou mo&s;t angelic among the daughters of men, &s;hall I &s;et the appari|tion of thy fir&s;t parent before thee? Shall I call up the departed Eve from the grave, to tell thee what it truly becometh all her daughters to do?</P>
<P>And Kunaza pondered, and &s;aid, Verily it would plea&s;e me to &s;ee and hear the departed &s;pirit of the fir&s;t woman.</P>
<P>And Pharmarus exulted, and &s;aid, My &s;oul delights in thy fellow&s;hip, O thou mo&s;t magnanimous of mortals!</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">And he &s;truck the earth with his foot: the ground trembled, and was rent a&s;un|der:</P>
<P>From the opening thereof there i&s;&s;ued a thick &s;moke, and after the &s;moke, there aro&s;e a venerable phantom:</P>
<P>And the phantom had the vi&s;age of Eve; and it bowed the head and &s;pake:</P>
<P>Deceive not thy&s;elf with fal&s;e pride, O my daughter! Let me warn thee not to live and die in a fooli&s;h ignorance of delights, which thy frame has been fa&s;hioned to enjoy!</P>
<P>Such were the words of the phantom; and it waited not for reply, but &s;unk again into the earth.</P>
<P>And the face of Kunaza was covered with confu&s;ion; and &s;he was almo&s;t a|&s;hamed that &s;he was yet a virgin.</P>
<P>And Pharmarus read her inmo&s;t thoughts, and exulted:</P>
<P>He &s;aw that his illu&s;ions began to pre|vail over her &s;en&s;es; and he continued to tempt her &s;till farther.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">He pre&s;&s;ed her trembling hand, and he exclaimed, Thou alone art worthy among&s;t women to participate in the deep di&s;coveries of my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>O ble&s;s me with thy beauty, Kunaza! and I will enrich thee with a wonderous power, which no mortal but thy&s;elf &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>I will enable thee to elude the ravage of time; and, when &s;even centuries have rolled over thy head, to appear &s;till as lovely as thou art in this moment.</P>
<P>I will teach thee to make thy&s;elf invi|&s;ible with the rapidity of thought, and, by pa&s;&s;ing un&s;een at thy plea&s;ure, to pe|netrate every &s;ecret thou can&s;t wi&s;h to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>Thus &s;pake the in&s;idious Pharmarus; and the curio&s;ity of the maiden was in|flamed:</P>
<P>There were many things that &s;he panted to know, and in her heart &s;he co|veted &s;upernatural power.</P>
<P>And Pharmarus &s;aw that his tempta|tion
<PB N="33" REF="35">
had entered into her &s;oul; and he exulted in the &s;ucce&s;s of his devices.</P>
<P>He continued to &s;olicit the maiden; and her bo&s;om was convul&s;ed with a doubtful conflict.</P>
<P>Her cheek became red as the crim&s;on ro&s;e; but &s;he threw back her head upon her &s;houlder, to avoid the flaming eyes of Pharmarus.</P>
<P>And as the pine bendeth beneath the pa&s;&s;ing wind, &s;o was the rea&s;on of Kunaza bowed down by the &s;udden gu&s;t of de|&s;ire.</P>
<P>She trembled in the &s;truggle of pa&s;|&s;ions; but her virtuous &s;pirit aro&s;e with new vigour, as the tree ari&s;eth from a tran|&s;ient pre&s;&s;ure, and points directly to the heaven, by who&s;e influence it pro&s;pers.</P>
<P>And the &s;oul of the maiden now com|muned with it&s;elf, and &s;aid:</P>
<P>O Kunaza, &s;uppre&s;s the evil ambition that &s;ubtlety is kindling in thy bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Pharmarus may enable thee indeed to elude every mortal eye; but from the
<PB N="34" REF="36">
&s;ight of God and his angels, there is none who can teach thee to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Then wi&s;h not to purcha&s;e &s;uperna|tural power by the &s;acrifice of a greater good; by lo&s;ing the ine&s;timable peace of an innocent &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And while her &s;oul was thus commun|ing with it&s;elf, every evil de&s;ire departed from the purified heart of the virgin.</P>
<P>She turned her face to Pharmarus: &s;he looked on him with a look of di&s;dain, and &s;aid:</P>
<P>Away from me, thou unworthy &s;pirit! The &s;oul of Kunaza is impowered to ab|hor and deride thy in&s;idious machina|tions.</P>
<P>Thou &s;eeke&s;t to rob me of a trea&s;ure, which if I &s;hould weakly &s;uffer thee to take, all the potent &s;pells of thy magic can never re&s;tore it to the repentant mourner again.</P>
<P>And the frenzy of rage and di&s;ap|pointment began to &s;well in the &s;oul of Pharmarus.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">He ca&s;t a furious glance upon the vir|gin, and &s;aid:</P>
<P>By the powers of darkne&s;s, thou art as &s;ubtle as the &s;erpent him&s;elf. Had thy parent Eve been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of thy cun|ning, &s;he had made the prince of temp|ters a fool.</P>
<P>But I &s;wear, by the flames that burn within me, thou &s;halt not e&s;cape from my embrace: I will make thee the proud mother of a young giant.</P>
<P>And he gra&s;ped the virgin with the vehement gra&s;p of outrageous de&s;ire: and &s;he &s;hrieked aloud in the agonies of terror.</P>
<P>And at the &s;ound of her &s;hriek, the angel Gabriel alighted upon the earth: Pharmarus &s;aw him, and was aba&s;hed for a moment.</P>
<P>Then all his evil pa&s;&s;ions rekindled with double fury; and he prepared to contend with Gabriel for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Kunaza.</P>
<P>But his powers of re&s;i&s;tance were wi|thered
<PB N="36" REF="38">
by the glance of rebuke that fla&s;hed from the radiant vi&s;age of the pro|tecting &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And Gabriel &s;eized him with the arm of ju&s;tice and power; and exclaimed with mild dignity to the maiden:</P>
<P>O Kunaza! thou ha&s;t fought a good fight; and all the faithful &s;pirits of heaven are thy friends.</P>
<P>Know that the &s;eraph Uriel and I are &s;ent from the throne of God to puni&s;h the fal&s;e and licentious angels, who have de|ba&s;ed their nature with the impurities of the earth.</P>
<P>And in honour of thy virtue, it is or|dained by thy Maker, Kunaza, that thy enemy, Pharmarus, &s;hall fall the fir&s;t victim to the ju&s;t vengeance of heaven.</P>

<P>It is with great concern I inform my reader, that this invaluable fragment does not extend beyond the preceding imperfect &s;entence. I am per&s;uaded, that every per|&s;on of feeling, every true friend to virginity, mu&s;t lament, that we are not made fully ac|quainted with the final de&s;tiny of the inter|e&s;ting Kunaza. We may, however, &s;afely affirm, that after &s;he had re&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully all the ba&s;e machinations and power of the prince of magic, &s;he could never fall by the &s;trength or artifice of man. I tru&s;t, therefore, that her name and character will now obtain the honour they de&s;erve, from all the nations of the modern world; and that the &s;i&s;terhood, in particular, will never fail to revere her, as the original pre&s;ident of Old Maids.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Conjectures concerning Old Maids among the Jews, Aegyptians, and &s;ome other Nations of Antiquity.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t centuries after the deluge, it &s;eems to have been the wi&s;h of every individual to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of repeopling the de&s;olated world. At a time when a numerous progeny was con&s;idered as real opulence, and a peculiar mark of the divine favour, it is not probable that any female &s;hould have willingly precluded her&s;elf from the mo&s;t envied di&s;tinction. Indeed, the Hebrew women appear to have been actuated by the mo&s;t lively de&s;ire of increa&s;ing the number of their re&s;pective families. Children were regarded as &s;uch a trea&s;ure, that &s;everal wives of the patri|archs, whom nature had di&s;appointed in this expectation, very chearfully corrected
<PB N="39" REF="41">
the unkindne&s;s of their own con&s;titution, by pre&s;enting a handmaid to their hu&s;|bands. Among all the Mo&s;aic in&s;titutions, there is no trace of any order of men or women devoted to a &s;ingle life; and, though &s;ome of the fathers, who have &s;tu|died, in their writings, to rai&s;e the honour of mona&s;tic virginity, have affected to de|rive it from Miriam the &s;i&s;ter of Mo&s;es, by a&s;&s;erting that &s;he died a virgin, at the age of an hundred and thirty-three years, it is &s;aid with more probability, that this mu&s;ical &s;i&s;ter of the Jewi&s;h legi&s;lator was her&s;elf married to Hur, a man of eminence in the tribe of Judah. St. Jerome, who&s;e zeal for cha&s;tity has &s;ometimes tran&s;ported him beyond the limits of &s;ober rea&s;on, expre&s;&s;es an inclination to believe, that &s;everal wo|men, before the Chri&s;tian aera, received the gift of prophecy from God, as a reward for their living a life of virginity:&mdash;but it is re|markable, that the celebrated Hebrew pro|phete&s;&s;es were married women. Deborah was the wife of Lapidoth; and Huldah,
<PB N="40" REF="42">
who&s;e prophecy is recorded in the 22d chapter of the &s;econd book of Kings, is not only mentioned as the wife of Shallum, but is &s;aid to have dwelt in the college of Je|ru&s;alem; a &s;ufficient proof that virginity was not required in tho&s;e females, who made a part of that hallowed in&s;titution. The heroine as well as the prophete&s;s might contribute to the glory of her nation, with|out any claim to this cha&s;te perfection. Jael, who is celebrated in a &s;ong of triumph for the &s;laughter of Si&s;era, was the wife of Heber the Kenite; and the more noble Judith, immortali&s;ed for delivering her country, by the de&s;truction of Holofernes, was, at the time of her exploit, a young wi|dow. Throughout the hi&s;tory of the Jews, from their father Abraham to their utter di&s;per&s;ion, I cannot recollect the exi&s;tence of any one di&s;tingui&s;hed Old Maid; nor is it probable, that many ancient virgins were ever to be di&s;covered, in a nation where every man was at liberty to marry as many wives as he thought him&s;elf able to &s;up|port;
<PB N="41" REF="43">
and where the wi&s;e&s;t of their princes was &s;o weak as to encumber him&s;elf with a dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;hment of many hundred concubines.</P>
<P>As the Aegyptians were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a melancholy ca&s;t of temper, and a pa&s;&s;ion for gloomy retirement, we might be led to imagine, that the women of that country were the fir&s;t who devoted them&s;elves to the mortifications of religious celibacy; but there is a remarkable a&s;&s;ertion in Hero|dotus, which &s;eems to preclude us from &s;uch a conjecture. In &s;peaking of Aegypt, he expre&s;sly &s;ays,
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">. <BIBL>Herodotus, p. 120. edit. We&s;&s;el.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> no woman is ever con&s;ecrated to any Divinity, male or fe|male, the holy office belonging &s;olely to men;</Q>
yet the &s;ame great hi&s;torian in|forms us, that women acted a principal part in the hallowed my&s;teries of this artful people; not, indeed, as we may fairly con|jecture, for the purpo&s;es of cha&s;tity, as he
<PB N="42" REF="44">
&s;ays, that in the temple of the Aegyptian Jupiter at Thebes, as in that of Belus at Babylon, a virgin was &s;ecluded for the God, and &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;leep with the Divinity him&s;elf, in a magnificent bed prepared for that purpo&s;e, in the highe&s;t apartment of the building. From this ceremony, and from other circum&s;tances, we may con|clude, that Aegypt was not very fertile in the production of Old Maids. Parents of the poorer &s;ort &s;old their female children to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves; and we cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that many an|cient virgins exi&s;ted in &s;uch a country, where two of its &s;overeigns, according to the hi&s;torian I have quoted, pro&s;tituted their own daughters in the mo&s;t public manner; the fir&s;t, to &s;upply his exhau&s;ted trea&s;ury; and the &s;econd, to detect a very artful thief <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the amu&s;ing &s;tory of Rhamp&s;initus and his daughter, in the &s;econd book of Herodotus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If we mu&s;t not expect to find an Old Maid in Aegypt, we have &s;till le&s;s chance of
<PB N="43" REF="45">
meeting with this rarity among the Baby|lonians. This ingenious people had de|vi&s;ed a very happy expedient, which is highly approved by Herodotus, to prevent their women's being expo&s;ed to the morti|fications of a &s;ingle life, by the want of per|&s;onal attractions. It was their annual cu&s;|tom to produce all their virgins, who had attained the marriageable age, in a kind of public auction; the mo&s;t beautiful were &s;old for con&s;iderable &s;ums, and this pur|cha&s;e money was di&s;tributed in &s;uch a man|ner, among the homely dam&s;els, as to pro|cure for each of them a hu&s;band. Such a civil in&s;titution is in it&s;elf almo&s;t &s;ufficient to have prevented the exi&s;tence of an Old Maid among them; but their religious ce|remonies, if we may give them credit, had &s;till a greater tendency to produce this ef|fect, as every woman was required, once in her life, to admit the embraces of a &s;tranger in or near the temple of their godde&s;s Mylitta.</P>
<P>In Phoenicia, where Venus and Adonis
<PB N="44" REF="46">
were particularly wor&s;hipped, the com|merce between the &s;exes was &s;till more li|centious. We may, indeed, ob&s;erve, that among &s;everal nations of antiquity, the &s;a|crifice of female cha&s;tity was con&s;idered as a religious duty. Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank among the Armenians, as we are told by Strabo, devoted their virgin daughters to the godde&s;s Anaitis. It was their cu&s;|tom, that the&s;e young women &s;hould be pro&s;tituted for a con&s;iderable time in the &s;ervice of their Divinity, and &s;ettled after|wards in marriage, no man refu&s;ing a ma|trimonial connection with &s;uch hallowed females <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.

Herodotus, every girl plays the harlot.&mdash; Yet, in the luxurious region of A&s;ia, &s;ome religious in&s;titutions were e&s;tabli&s;hed for the protection of cha&s;tity. The famous temple of Diana, at Ephe&s;us, had a train of holy virgins; and, for their perfect &s;ecurity, the prie&s;ts, to who&s;e guardian&s;hip they were en|tru&s;ted, were all eunuchs. Yet we cannot venture to affirm, that this &s;anctuary pro|duced a number of Old Maids; for it is probable, that the&s;e young votaries of Diana, like the Ve&s;tals of Rome, who&s;e hi&s;tory I &s;hall con&s;ider hereafter, had the privilege of marrying towards the middle &s;ea&s;on of life. This we may al&s;o conjecture to have been the ca&s;e with the religious virgins in Per&s;ia; who &s;eem to have been guarded with peculiar &s;anctity, from an anecdote related by Ju&s;tin:&mdash;Darius, the &s;on of Artaxerxes, not &s;atisfied with tho&s;e imperial honours to which his father had rai&s;ed him, demanded of that monarch his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s A&s;pa&s;ia.

Plutarch relates this incident with &s;ome variations, but in a manner which equally &s;hews, that cha&s;tity among the Per&s;ians was very &s;trictly guarded in a religious a&s;ylum; yet virgi|nity, as the &s;tory &s;ufficiently proves, was not a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for the cha|racter of a prie&s;te&s;s.&mdash;Among all the king|doms of antiquity, none, perhaps, contri|buted le&s;s than Per&s;ia to the &s;i&s;terhood of Old Maids, as the Per&s;ians are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a peculiar ceremony, which &s;trongly proves, that both &s;exes con&s;idered celibacy as an object of abhorrence, not only as an enemy to human enjoyment, but as pre|cluding them from the happine&s;s they ex|pected in a future life.

<P>I mu&s;t own, that many contradictory opinions have been held concerning the&s;e more doubtful heroines, the Gorgons.

Every hero appears to have thought him&s;elf entitled to the care&s;&s;es of the maiden cap|tives, whom his own prowe&s;s, or the chance of war, had placed within his power; and the venerable Ne&s;tor, at the age of four&s;core and five, does not retire to &s;leep without that agreeable reward of ancient heroi&s;m, a fair and affectionate dam&s;el. The warm and enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration with which cri|tics of the mo&s;t liberal &s;pirit have contem|plated the genius of Homer, has led &s;ome of them to a&s;&s;ert, that his poems are &s;o won|derfully comprehen&s;ive, as to include every character which human life can exhibit.

Perhaps, as this immortal bard is &s;o minutely faithful in his delineation of manners and cu&s;toms, we might infer, that no &s;uch character exi&s;ted in his time; and in|deed, the more we reflect on the religious and political in&s;titutions of Greece, the more rea&s;on &s;hall we find to believe, that the number of Grecian Old Maids mu&s;t have been at all periods very incon&s;ider|able.</P>
<P>It was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the Greeks to aggrandize their country; and, as they ju&s;tly con&s;idered citizens as the real wealth of every &s;tate, they thought it the fir&s;t of patriotic duties, equally incumbent on both the &s;exes, to enrich the republic by increa&s;|ing its numbers.

<P>From the&s;e examples we may conclude, that a Grecian female hardly ever expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to become an Old Maid; and indeed, whatever her own private wi&s;hes might be, the iniquitous laws of her country made her &s;o much the &s;lave of her relations, that &s;he had little or no power of fixing her own &s;ituation in life.

we have rea&s;on to apprehend their having &s;uffered every &s;pecies of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion. If Greece did not abound in voluntary Old Maids, we may believe that &s;ome lovely females of that celebrated region were kept in a wretched &s;tate of celibacy, by the iniquity of a tyrannical parent or guar|dian. If a &s;uper&s;titious and cowardly old father happened to dream that a grand-child would prove fatal to his peace, he probably imitated the ab&s;urd precaution of Acri&s;ius, and attempted to confine his daughter, like Danae, in <HI>a &s;ubterranean chamber on a bed of bra&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.

There is indeed an amu&s;ing anec|dote in Herodotus, which may &s;erve to &s;hew, that parents u&s;ed to threaten their children with the dreaded continuance of a virgin life. Polycrates of Samos, being angry with his daughter for oppo&s;ing his vi&s;it to the Per&s;ian noble, Oraetes, becau&s;e &s;he had been alarmed by a terrific vi&s;ion, threatens the affectionate but teazing girl, that if he returns in &s;afety, &s;he &s;hall for a long time remain a virgin; to which &s;he re|plies with great filial tenderne&s;s, by praying that his threat may be accompli&s;hed, &s;ince &s;he would rather remain a virgin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.

<P>We may, however, believe that parental tyranny was not &s;o often exerci&s;ed in at|tempts to keep a daughter &s;ingle, as in tho&s;e of marrying her to a per&s;on &s;he abhorred. Perhaps in the latter ca&s;e there was the greater
<PB N="63" REF="65">
probability of her becoming an Old Maid; not from the &s;pirit of contradiction, but be|cau&s;e an unhappy girl, &s;o per&s;ecuted, had no re&s;ource to &s;hield her from a dete&s;ted marriage, but the &s;acred altar of &s;ome maidenly power, who offered an a&s;ylum to virgins in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

mu&s;t disfigure their faces with a medical lotion, and dre&s;s them&s;elves in the habit of the Furies. Whether, after annexing this condition to her patronage, &s;he was likely or not to have many virgins in her &s;anctuary, is a point that I &s;ubmit to the judgment of the ladies: ob&s;erving, how|ever, that none of my fair readers are pro|per judges of the que&s;tion, except tho&s;e, who have been per&s;ecuted by the addre&s;&s;es of a very odious &s;uitor.</P>
<P>From the preceding part of this chapter, &s;ome readers of a &s;ceptical ca&s;t may be in|clined to doubt, if Greece ever produced an Old Maid. But if the te&s;timony of a poet may be admitted, the que&s;tion is explicitly decided. That the character really exi&s;ted at Athens, we are expre&s;sly informed by Ari&s;tophanes, in a ver&s;e which I have adopted as a motto to this E&s;&s;ay; and which, for the &s;ake of my curious fair readers, I &s;hall now tran&s;late: endeavour|ing, at the &s;ame time, to collect as much light as I can from its comic author, con|cerning
<PB N="66" REF="68">
the real condition of Attic Old Maids.</P>
<P>In the comedy, which bears the name of Ly&s;i&s;trata, that lady conceives the lively project of in&s;tructing her own &s;ex to obtain an ab&s;olute dominion over the men; and to force them into a conclu&s;ion of tho&s;e wars, by which Greece was perpetually di&s;tracted. As &s;he propo&s;es her pacific expedient with more wit than mode&s;ty, my fair readers will undoubtedly approve my delicacy in not giving them a minute account of it; and the more &s;o, as it is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that Ly&s;i&s;trata, after touching on the vexations that war pro|duces to married women, proceeds to the following &s;entiment of di&s;intere&s;ted com|pa&s;&s;ion:

<P><PB N="67" REF="69">It is very remarkable, that although Ly|&s;i&s;trata thus mentions the Old Maids as ob|jects of her &s;olicitude, the poet does not venture to introduce upon the &s;tage a &s;ingle ancient virgin, either in this play, or in a drama, where he had, I think, a &s;till fairer occa&s;ion to di&s;play the character with all his licentious vivacity: I mean his comedy of the <HI>Female Orators</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&Egr;&Kgr;&Kgr;&Lgr;&EEgr;&Sgr;&Igr;&Agr;&Zgr;&Ogr;&Ugr;&Sgr;&Lgr;&Igr;.</NOTE>.

<Q>it is enacted, that no young man &s;hall re|ceive the favours of a young woman, till he has fir&s;t gratified the inclinations of an old one.</Q>
The modern reader might ex|pect the poet to introduce, after this inci|dent, even <HI>a chorus of Old Maids</HI>; but, li|centious as he was, Ari&s;tophanes had more re&s;pect for the &s;i&s;terhood. It is true, in|deed, that he brings &s;ome ancient ladies on the &s;tage, and repre&s;ents them not a little &s;olicitous to take advantage of a law &s;o ex|pre&s;s in their favour; but they are very far from appearing in the character of Old Maids, as one of them gives us clearly to under&s;tand, that &s;he has no claim to that title.</P>
<P>I would by no means in&s;inuate, that the remarkable conduct of Ari&s;tophanes, in not exhibiting an Old Maid, might tempt us to &s;u&s;pect, that no &s;uch character exi&s;ted in his time. The only inference I would draw
<PB N="69" REF="71">
from it is this: that the Old Maids of Athens were either entirely &s;eque&s;tered from &s;ociety, or guarded with &s;uch a reli|gious veneration, as the mo&s;t licentious of comic poets pre&s;umed not to violate. That &s;uch per&s;onages really exi&s;ted, I not only think the &s;peech of Ly&s;i&s;trata a &s;ufficient proof; but I apprehend their condition, as &s;he intimates, was owing to the frequency of war among the Grecian republics.</P>
<P>How far the women of this martial country con&s;idered them&s;elves as neglected and aggrieved by that contentious &s;pirit, which detained their warriors in di&s;tant fields of battle, we have a memorable ex|ample in the following very &s;ingular anec|dote recorded by Strabo.</P>

<P><Q>In marching forth to this enterprize, they left only their very young and very old citizens to guard their own city.

<P>The mythological de&s;criptions of the Grecian poets are generally founded on &s;ome hi&s;torical fact; and the poem of Non|nus contains a very remarkable pa&s;&s;age, which almo&s;t per&s;uades me, that the women of Greece, at &s;ome early and ob&s;cure period of their hi&s;tory, were &s;o vehemently devoted to the arts of Minerva, that they neglected or renounced the more intere&s;ting rites of Venus, and almo&s;t endangered the continu|ance of the world.

<P>I rejoice in being able to enliven and il|lu&s;trate this philo&s;ophical E&s;&s;ay, by &s;o appo|&s;ite a pa&s;&s;age from the very poet, however ob&s;cure, from whom Mr. Bryant has &s;truck &s;o much light in his profounder re&s;earches. I have given almo&s;t a literal tran&s;lation of the preceding &s;ong; and I flatter my&s;elf that my candid readers, who are familiar with the deci&s;ive &s;tyle of our antiquarians, will allow me to con&s;ider it as a <HI>&s;triking proof,</HI> that a confederacy of very beautiful ancient &s;pin&s;ters was once formed in Greece, who re&s;olutely devoted them&s;elves to the quiet labour of the loom, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the more important bu&s;ine&s;s of forming new citizens to &s;upport their country. Evident as this point mu&s;t appear from the&s;e remarkable ver&s;es, it might puzzle, perhaps, even the very learned gentleman ju&s;t menti|oned, to decide at what period of the Grecian
<PB N="80" REF="82">
hi&s;tory the&s;e &s;pin&s;ters lived, and how long they per&s;i&s;ted in their dangerous re&s;olution. From the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ong I am in|clined to believe, that they re&s;embled a certain &s;ociety of modern ladies, under the guidance of a &s;eraphic pre&s;ident, intitled Madonella; a lady who&s;e adventures are related with infinite humour in the fir&s;t vo|lume of the Tatler, and who, having devoted her&s;elf and her a&s;&s;ociates to a life of virgin purity and retirement, was rapidly and in|geniou&s;ly induced to take an active part in the nece&s;&s;ary increa&s;e of the world.</P>
<P>My de&s;ire to do all po&s;&s;ible honour to the &s;i&s;terhood, has made me extremely &s;olicitous to di&s;cover every Attic Old Maid, who&s;e name might reflect a lu&s;tre on the community: but in my hi&s;torical en|quiries for this purpo&s;e, I have not been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as I expected to be. Many Gre|cian ladies have been celebrated for an at|tachment to philo&s;ophical &s;tudies; and I concluded that, in the li&s;t of the&s;e, I &s;hould find &s;everal individuals, who in cha&s;tity as well as learning were the faithful votaries
<PB N="81" REF="83">
of Minerva. Mon&s;ieur Menage has com|piled, with exten&s;ive erudition, a little hi&s;|tory of all the female philo&s;ophers, of whom any traces can be found in the writ|ings of the ancients. Their number amounts to &s;ixty-five; but it is very remarkable, that if we except St. Catherine, there is only one lady in this long catalogue, who is celebrated for her virginity; and how far that might be either real or meritorious may &s;till be a que&s;tion, as this lady did not live &s;ingle, but was the wife of the philo&s;o|pher I&s;idorus.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed among the ancient female profe&s;&s;ors of philo&s;ophy, I reflected with &s;ingular plea&s;ure, that tho&s;e more venerable poetical old ladies, the Sibyls, would &s;upply this defect; and of all the Old Maids that antiquity could furni&s;h, I con&s;idered them as be&s;t entitled to the ho|nourable di&s;tinction of being cla&s;&s;ed at the head of the &s;i&s;terhood. I imagined their title to this high rank to be fully confirmed by the &s;entence of St. Jerome; who, &s;peak|ing
<PB N="82" REF="84">
of them, in the fir&s;t part of his eloquent invective again&s;t Jovinian, expre&s;sly &s;ays, that

But, examining the hi&s;tory of the&s;e reverend ladies with that attention which it de&s;erves, I &s;oon perceived that the fervent and generous &s;aint had given them credit for a quality, which they were very far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. The learned Servatius Gallaeus, who has obliged the world with a thick quarto volume on the&s;e intere&s;ting females, completely expo&s;es the mi&s;take of St. Jerome, and laughs at him as a ridicu|lous champion, contending for the cha&s;tity of a harlot. Nor can we wonder that the credulity of the candid &s;aint &s;hould be treated with deri&s;ion, &s;ince one of the Si|byls, for who&s;e continence he contends, very freely acknowledges, in a remarkable

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. On the Ve&s;tals, and other Old Maids, of Rome before the Chri&s;tian Aera.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Roman empire was founded on a rape, and no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred and eighty-three Sabine virgins were for|cibly converted into wives, according to the account of that accurate antiquarian Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, we cannot ex|pect to meet with many Old Maids in the early periods of the Roman hi&s;tory. In|deed, in the fir&s;t ages of the republic, the patriotic ambition of the Romans, and the expre&s;s letter of their law, operated with equal force again&s;t a life of celibacy. Ci|cero, in the opening of his third book, <HI>De Legibus,</HI> has given us the very words of the &s;tatute, by which the cen&s;ors were directed, not only to examine and enroll the children of every Roman family, but to take care
<PB N="85" REF="87">
that no citizens &s;hould lead a &s;ingle life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Equitum peditumque prolem de&s;cribunto: coeli|bes e&s;&s;e prohibento.</NOTE>; and we learn from a valuable fragment pre|&s;erved in Aulus Gellius, that the mo&s;t emi|nent &s;enators of Rome con&s;idered marriage, not as a &s;tate of private enjoyment, but as a public indi&s;pen&s;able burthen, which every man was bound to &s;upport for the good of the community. As the &s;ubject is curious and intere&s;ting, I &s;hall pre&s;ent to my reader not only the fragment to which I allude, but a con&s;iderable pa&s;&s;age from the author who has given it a place in his mi&s;cella|neous and amu&s;ing work.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth chapter, in the fir&s;t book of Aulus Gellius, begins in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>The oration which Metellus Numi|dicus, a man of dignity and eloquence, delivered, in his cen&s;or&s;hip, to exhort the people to matrimony, was read to a large and learned audience. In this oration it was thus written: 'If, Romans, we had
<PB N="86" REF="88">
the power of living without a wife, we &s;hould all be free from that trouble; but &s;ince nature has &s;o di&s;po&s;ed it, that we can neither live very commodiou&s;ly with them, nor without them exi&s;t at all, we mu&s;t provide rather for perpetual &s;ecurity, than for tran&s;ient plea&s;ure.' It appeared to &s;ome, that the cen&s;or Metellus, who&s;e intention was to exhort the people to marry, ought not to have made &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion concerning the trouble and perpetual vexations of the married life, &s;ince, in&s;tead of exhorting, he &s;eemed ra|ther to di&s;&s;uade and deter. His oration, they &s;aid, ought rather to have taken a contrary turn; he &s;hould have a&s;&s;erted, that marriage in general was attended with no vexations; and if at any time it appeared to produce &s;ome, the&s;e, he &s;hould have &s;aid, were light and trifling, very ea&s;ily endured, and obliterated by a &s;uperior portion of emolument and de|light; nay, that the&s;e very vexations were neither common to all, nor owing
<PB N="87" REF="89">
to the nature of the connection, but oc|ca&s;ioned by the failings and inju&s;tice of particular hu&s;bands. But Titus Ca&s;|tricius maintained, that Metellus had &s;poken both with truth and propriety. It is one thing, &s;aid he, to &s;peak as a cen&s;or, and another to &s;peak as a rheto|rician. We allow the latter to u&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions fraudulent and bold, &s;ubtile and captious, if they have but a certain air of truth, and the power of exciting, by any artifice, the pa&s;&s;ions of the audience. He ob&s;erved, moreover, that it is di&s;|graceful to a rhetorician, even in a bad cau&s;e, to leave any part of his ground de|&s;erted and unfought; but for Metellus, he &s;aid, who &s;poke to the Roman people with that &s;anctity of character, as a man who&s;e life had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by ac|cumulated honours, it became him to utter nothing but what he him&s;elf, and his whole audience, might e&s;teem &s;trictly true; and the more &s;o, as he &s;poke upon a &s;ubject, of which the experience of
<PB N="88" REF="90">
every day enabled every man to judge. Confe&s;&s;ing, therefore, tho&s;e vexations which were notorious to all men, and de|&s;erving, by that confe&s;&s;ion, the confi|dence of his auditors, he at la&s;t, with ea&s;e and rapidity, per&s;uaded them of that important and e&s;&s;ential point, that the pre&s;ervation of the &s;tate depended on the prevalence of marriage.</Q></P>
<P>Without &s;topping to make any farther remarks on the eloquence of Metellus&mdash; from who&s;e hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion we might in|fer, that the mo&s;t &s;pirited of the old Ro|mans were not perfectly able to manage their wives&mdash;I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that in the fir&s;t ages of the republic, the cen&s;ors &s;eem to have attended very minutely to this part of their office, which had &s;o &s;trong a ten|dency to prevent the exi&s;tence of Old Maids. Valerius Maximus informs us, that the cen&s;ors Camillus and Po&s;thumius levied a fine on tho&s;e citizens who had grown old in a &s;ingle life, and brought it to the public trea&s;ury. Plutarch al&s;o, in his

&mdash; From the latter circum&s;tance we may infer, that virgins of a marriageable age were at this period very &s;carce in Rome; and, in|deed, we may believe, that, in the active pa|triotic days of the republic, there would not have exi&s;ted a &s;ingle Roman Old Maid, had not the &s;ingular religious e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ve&s;tal virgins formed a kind of nur|&s;ery for that re&s;pectable &s;i&s;terhood to whom this work is devoted.</P>

<P><Q>The virgins, who &s;erve the Godde&s;s, were originally four, and elected by the kings, according to the laws e&s;tabli&s;hed by Numa; but, afterwards, from the multiplicity of their functions, their number was encrea&s;ed to &s;ix, and has &s;o remained to this day. They live in the temple of the Godde&s;s, into which none are hindered from entering in the day|time; but it is not lawful for any man to remain there in the night. They are under a nece&s;&s;ity of continuing unmar|ried during the &s;pace of thirty years; which time they employ in offering &s;a|crifices, and performing other rites or|dained by the law. During the fir&s;t ten years, their duty was to learn their functions; in the &s;econd ten, to perform them; and, during the remainder of their time, to teach others.

In the rhetorical frag|ments of Seneca, a fair delinquent is men|tioned, who, being convicted of impurity, was brought to &s;uffer death, by being thrown from the &s;ummit of &s;o high a rock, that it was terrific even to tho&s;e who looked down from it in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Erat altitudo montis etiam &s;ecur&egrave; de&s;picientibus horrenda.</NOTE>.

to lengthen her puni&s;hment. Seneca does not inform us, that &s;he peri&s;hed in con&s;e|quence of this cruel argument; and, in|deed, I am tempted to hope, for the ho|nour of human nature, that the whole &s;tory was nothing more than the fiction of a fan|ciful declaimer.</P>
<P>However this may be, the anecdote af|fords us a &s;triking proof of the extreme &s;e|verity with which the Romans regarded the frailty of a Ve&s;tal. Indeed, the &s;ame au|thor furni&s;hes us with a proof of this point yet more extraordinary; for he gives us part of a criminal oration again&s;t a Ve&s;tal, who was accu&s;ed of ince&s;t, not for any evi|dent act of incontinence, but merely for having written a ver&s;e, which forcibly ex|pre&s;&s;ed her &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which the married fair ones enjoy.

of all the natural pa&s;&s;ions. The Romans &s;eem to have been &s;en&s;ible of the many mortifications, which mu&s;t have attended the life of the&s;e lovely captives: and they endeavoured to compen&s;ate the evils of their condition, by frequently increa&s;ing the va|rious honours that were paid to every indi|vidual of this holy order. Even the cold-blooded Augu&s;tus be&s;towed upon them &s;ome marks of his favour; and, as the hi&s;to|rian Dion Ca&s;&s;ius a&s;&s;erts, admitted the&s;e &s;e|que&s;tered virgins to the enjoyment of all tho&s;e civic rights, which the policy of Rome had confined to mothers. Among the many privileges that belonged to the Ve&s;tal, there was one that mu&s;t have been peculiarly de|lightful to a feeling heart; I mean the pri|vilege of &s;aving the condemned. The Ro|mans attached &s;uch an idea of &s;anctity to the per&s;on of a Ve&s;tal, that if a criminal, in his way to execution, was fortunate enough to meet one of the&s;e virgins, the bare &s;ight of &s;o pure a per&s;onage was &s;ufficient to expiate his offences, and the happy incident imme|diately

re&s;tored him to life and liberty. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, however, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the prie&s;te&s;s to affirm, that &s;uch meeting was the mere effect of chance. Yet in the mo&s;t turbulent and &s;anguinary days of the republic, the lives of &s;ome political delin|quents have been &s;aved by the &s;upplication of the Ve&s;tals. The vindictive Sylla him|&s;elf is &s;aid to have granted the life of Cae&s;ar to the interce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate vir|gins, highly provoked as he was by the re|&s;i&s;tance of that &s;pirited and ambitious youth. Perhaps the extreme eagerne&s;s, which Cae&s;ar afterwards &s;hewed to obtain the office of &s;upreme pontiff, was partly owing to his generous de&s;ire of di&s;playing his gratitude to the&s;e holy virgins, to who&s;e tenderne&s;s he was indebted for his life: for it was the duty of the &s;upreme pontiff to &s;uperintend this female &s;ociety; to retire into a place of privacy with every young Ve&s;tal, who had committed any trivial of|fence, and, having &s;tripped the fair delin|quent, to &s;courge her in proportion to her

demerit. It was perhaps in this high office that the celebrated humanity of this merci|ful tyrant was mo&s;t uniformly exerted; and, however the Roman empire might ju&s;tly murmur at his u&s;urped authority, when we con&s;ider the characteri&s;tics of this great man, we may rea&s;onably conclude, that no tender Ve&s;tal ever thought her&s;elf much aggrieved by falling under the rod of Cae&s;ar. It had indeed been happy for this tender &s;i&s;ter|hood, if the &s;ucceeding emperors had &s;u|perintended them with that gentle &s;pirit, which on &s;uch occa&s;ions di&s;played it&s;elf in this the mo&s;t liberal and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of tyrants. But among the many mon&s;ters, who &s;ucceeded this extraordinary u&s;urper in the government of the Roman world, there were &s;ome, who appear to have de|lighted in the horrible enormity of burying even an innocent Ve&s;tal alive.

<Q>Domitian's vengeance generally raged with the greate&s;t fury, where his evidence failed him mo&s;t. That emperor had de|termined, that Cornelia Maximilla, one of the Ve&s;tal virgins, &s;hould be buried alive, from an extravagant notion, that tho&s;e kind of exemplary &s;everities did honour to his reign. Accordingly, in the character of high-prie&s;t, or rather in|deed in that of a lawle&s;s and cruel tyrant, he convened the &s;acred college, not in the pontifical court where they u&s;ually a&s;|&s;emble, but at his villa near Alba; and there (by a &s;entence no le&s;s wicked, as it was pa&s;&s;ed when &s;he was not pre&s;ent to de|fend her&s;elf, than as it was the effect of pa&s;|&s;ion and revenge) he condemned her of having violated her Ve&s;tal vow. Yet he him&s;elf had been guilty, not only of de|bauching his brother's daughter, but was

al&s;o acce&s;&s;ary to her death: for that lady being a widow, in order to conceal her &s;hame, endeavoured to procure an abor|tion, and by that means lo&s;t her life.

<P>But to return to the main &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent chapter, the Old Maids of ancient Rome.&mdash;I cannot indeed exhibit &s;uch a li&s;t of the&s;e ladies as I could wi&s;h; but the deficiency, without doubt, ari&s;es not from the rarity of the character, but from the in|excu&s;able inaccuracy, which I have before lamented in the ancient hi&s;torians and bio|graphers, who have failed to commemorate the merits of the &s;i&s;terhood. I am happy, however, in being able to conclude, and to embelli&s;h this chapter with the name of one illu&s;trious Old Maid, who may be regarded as a peculiar favourite of Minerva, &s;ince &s;he was not only eminent for her cha&s;tity, but excelled in one of the mo&s;t elegant among the arts. I mean the celebrated Lala, who, though not a native of Rome, ex|erci&s;ed the profe&s;&s;ion of painting in that city, during the youth of Marcus Varro. He pro|bably gave a full de&s;cription of this amiable

per&s;on, in one of tho&s;e 490 volumes, which he is &s;aid to have written. Though the works of this mo&s;t learned Roman have un|fortunately peri&s;hed, the name and merits of Lala have happily &s;urvived. We are told, that &s;he painted with great rapidity; that &s;he excelled in the portraits of women; and that her pictures bore a price &s;uperior to what was given to the mo&s;t &s;kilful pain|ters of her time. Her claim to honourable di&s;tinction in this volume, is grounded on the unque&s;tionable evidence of that pro|found naturali&s;t, antiquarian, and connoi&s;|&s;eur, the elder Pliny; who certainly could not be deceived in &s;uch a point of natural hi&s;tory; and who a&s;&s;erts, in the mo&s;t po&s;i|tive language, that Lala was a perpetual virgin.</P>
<P>With this lady I mu&s;t clo&s;e my very im|perfect account of the Pagan virgins; and, when I reflect how many good but un|known Old Maids exi&s;ted before the cha&s;te Lala, I cannot help breathing a &s;igh of re|gret, &s;imilar to that which Horace expre&s;&s;es

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. On the infinite Increa&s;e of Old Maids after the Chri&s;tian Aera.</HEAD>
<P>I Am now arrived at the mo&s;t hazardous part of this important E&s;&s;ay; and I feel that the future conduct of it mu&s;t be attended with many difficulties. To do full ju&s;tice to my Maiden &s;ubject, I hold it nece&s;&s;ary to dwell on &s;everal of tho&s;e ancient fathers of the church, who con&s;idered vir|ginity as the darling object of their pious lucubrations: but, as I wi&s;h to render the&s;e volumes attractive to every cla&s;s of readers, let me here declare, that I &s;hall zealou&s;ly
<PB N="136" REF="138">
endeavour to &s;peak of all the &s;aints, who have touched on this intere&s;ting topic be|fore me, in &s;uch a manner, that I may hope not to tire the volatile, or offend the pious.</P>
<P>By the pious, I mean only the good peo|ple of our reformed religion, being aware that I mu&s;t expect little or no mercy from a Catholic reader; for although I declare my|&s;elf the friend and champion of the hone&s;t Prote&s;tant Old Maid, I am very far from being an advocate for mona&s;tic virginity. Indeed, it is with pity and indignation, that I con&s;ider how many thou&s;and of the mo&s;t lovely females have been immured, to lan|gui&s;h in a cloi&s;ter, by parental tyranny; or have been led, by the in&s;inuating arts of &s;u|per&s;tition, to enter on a voluntary &s;eclu&s;ion from all the mo&s;t amiable duties and de|lights of human life. Though I am wil|ling to believe, that &s;incere purity has often re&s;ided in a convent, I cannot but con&s;ider the Prote&s;tant Old Maid, who &s;upports with chearful content a virginity, which is the con&s;equence rather of accident and nece&s;|&s;ity,
<PB N="137" REF="139">
than of choice, as a more exemplary and intere&s;ting per&s;onage than the Romi&s;h nun, who, in her zeal for cha&s;tity, renounces mankind for ever. I am convinced, that the former character, neglected and depre|ciated as it may have been, is more truly con&s;onant to the genuine &s;pirit of Chri&s;tia|nity, that &s;imple and &s;ublime religion, which is a friend to &s;ocial happine&s;s, and an enemy to every &s;elfi&s;h principle.</P>
<P>Since nature, rea&s;on, and faith may all incline us to co-operate in the pre&s;ervation of our &s;pecies, it is a&s;toni&s;hing, that any powers could be found &s;ufficient to coun|teract their united influence, and to make a number of human beings per&s;i&s;t in re|nouncing the mo&s;t precious privilege of their exi&s;tence, the privilege of communi|cating their own enjoyments, both tran&s;ient and eternal, to new beings, more dear to them than their own per&s;onal advantage. The &s;evere pains of child-birth are graci|ou&s;ly compen&s;ated by &s;uch a profu&s;ion of tender delight, that the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h timidity
<PB N="138" REF="140">
could not decline the burthen, after think|ing on its reward. The more we reflect on the generous energy of the maternal feel|ings, the more &s;hall we be &s;urpri&s;ed at the multitudes of women, who, in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity, devoted them&s;elves to a &s;ingle life. The whole &s;ex appears to have been inflamed with a pa&s;&s;ion for virginity; and a re&s;pectable author, who has lately given us an amu&s;ing hi&s;tory of women, informs us, that in the fourth century, a &s;ingle city contained no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and virgins, who had taken a vow of perpetual cha&s;tity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alexander's Hi&s;tory of Women, Oct. edit. p. 415. vol. II.&mdash;This book would be more valuable, if the ingenious writer had quoted his authorities.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding the extreme humility which they profe&s;&s;ed, I am afraid there was a &s;trong mixture of &s;ecret pride in this unrea&s;onable conduct. All the primitive Chri&s;tian maidens &s;eem to have coveted &s;uch a &s;epulchral panegyric as the following couplet be&s;tows on our queen Elizabeth:
<Q><PB N="139" REF="141">
<L>She was and is (what can there more be &s;aid?)</L>
<L>On earth the chief, in heaven the &s;econd maid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden's Remains, p. 524.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>Perhaps the nuns of the ancient church had preten&s;ions to this ideal &s;anctity le&s;s equivocal than tho&s;e of our virgin queen. However this may be, it is a curious and in|tere&s;ting &s;peculation to &s;earch into the im|mediate cau&s;es of &s;uch wonderful facts; and to examine the particular &s;ource of tho&s;e ideas, that could &s;o forcibly counteract the tender bias of nature in the female character of tho&s;e times. The ardent zeal with which the early Chri&s;tians embraced a life of celi|bacy, may be a&s;cribed to two cau&s;es; fir&s;t, to the advice of St. Paul, who &s;trongly di&s;|&s;uades them from marriage; and &s;econdly, to tho&s;e flaming pieces of eccle&s;ia&s;tical elo|quence, in which the fathers of the church were plea&s;ed to magnify virginity, and to pour into the heated imagination of their
<PB N="140" REF="142">
female di&s;ciples an unquenchable love for this imaginary virtue. As I advance in this E&s;&s;ay, I &s;hall give a particular account of the&s;e remarkable orations. In the pre|&s;ent chapter, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to con|&s;ider the advice of St. Paul, and the imme|diate con&s;equences which it &s;eems to have produced.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that I &s;hall not be thought to fail in that re&s;pect, which every &s;incere Chri&s;tian owes to this eloquent and admirable apo&s;tle, by declaring that I have frequently read his &s;trong exhortation to a life of celibacy with &s;urpri&s;e and concern. His Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, in which he affirms, that it is better not to marry, in&s;tead of making me a convert to his opinion, induces me to exclaim with Milton,
<Q><L>Our Maker bids increa&s;e; who bids ab&s;tain</L>
<L>But our de&s;troyer, foe to God and Man?</L></Q>
It is true indeed that St. Paul is very far from uttering &s;uch a prohibition; and in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to Timothy he foretels,
<PB N="141" REF="143">
that this prohibitory doctrine &s;hall ari&s;e from &s;educing &s;pirits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv.</NOTE>. In the &s;econd chapter of the &s;ame Epi&s;tle, he appears to be &s;o far from an advocate for celibacy, that he al|mo&s;t &s;eems to intimate, that women mu&s;t work out their &s;alvation by the produc|tion of children <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 14.</NOTE>:&mdash;yet his addre&s;s to the Corinthians is &s;o pointed in favour of a &s;ingle life, his &s;arca&s;tic expre&s;&s;ion,
<Q>It is better to marry than to burn,</Q>
might, to many weak, or prudi&s;h, or enthu&s;ia&s;tic females, exhibit wedlock in &s;uch a degrading point of view, that perhaps his &s;trong exhortation to a life of virginity might influence many of his maiden di&s;ciples, more forcibly than an ab|&s;olute prohibition of marriage could have done. At all events, when we con&s;ider the exten&s;ive veneration which was ju&s;tly paid to this apo&s;tle, we may fairly conclude, that the multitude of primitive Old Maids was infinitely increa&s;ed by his Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians. As St. Paul expre&s;sly tells
<PB N="142" REF="144">
us, in this Epi&s;tle, that,
<Q>concerning virgins, he had no commandment of the Lord <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. vii. ver. 25.</NOTE>;</Q>
we may que&s;tion, without a &s;hadow of im|piety, the utility of his advice.&mdash;I confe&s;s, that at the fir&s;t view, it appeared to my un|der&s;tanding not con&s;i&s;tent with that bene|volent and temperate wi&s;dom, which cer|tainly adorned the character of St. Paul. But the excellent Mr. Locke, in a note to his Paraphra&s;e of this Epi&s;tle, &s;ugge&s;ts an idea that may ju&s;tify the apo&s;tle's di&s;&s;ua&s;ion from marriage, not as a general precept, but as a temporary coun&s;el. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by our great Chri&s;tian philo&s;opher, that St. Paul might &s;peak, in this Epi&s;tle,
<Q>out of a prophetical fore&s;ight of the approaching per|&s;ecution under Nero.</Q>
On this &s;uppo&s;i|tion he might di&s;&s;uade his di&s;ciples from marriage, not as an enemy to connubial en|joyments, but as fearing they would more &s;en&s;ibly feel the mi&s;ery of their impending oppre&s;&s;ion, if they were torn from all the delightful comforts of a married life.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">However wi&s;e and well-timed the apo&s;|tle's advice might be, we have rea&s;on to apprehend, that the extravagant attachment to virginity, which &s;ome of his female di&s;|ciples conceived, was the occa&s;ion of many dome&s;tic quarrels, and much private di&s;tre&s;s. At lea&s;t we have one memorable example of this effect, if we may give any credit to the marvellous adventures of his follower Thecla, who is celebrated by &s;everal fa|thers of the church as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious of the virgin martyrs. As the anecdotes of this lady are very remarkable, I &s;hall extract a little &s;ketch of her life from Jacobus Philippus Bergomen&s;is, who pub|li&s;hed, in 1497, a Latin folio <HI>on illu&s;trious Women,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to Beatrice queen of Bohemia.</P>
<P><Q>Thecla was a native of Iconium, a city of A&s;ia; &s;he was born in an elevated rank of life, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with the advan|tages of birth, the &s;uperior attractions of beauty. Her mother Theoclia was pre|paring for the delight of marrying her
<PB N="144" REF="146">
daughter to a noble and comely youth, who&s;e name was Thamirus, when St. Paul arriving in their city, happened to lodge in the hou&s;e adjoining to that in which Thecla re&s;ided. The virgin was &s;o fa&s;cinated by the eloquence of the apo&s;tle, that no intreaties could prevail on her to quit the window, where &s;he had placed her&s;elf to hear him, and where &s;he &s;at for three days without ta&s;ting any food <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In fene&s;tra itaque dom&ucirc;s &s;uae per triduum qua&s;i &s;ui oblita, ad audiendum hominem pellecta, &s;ine ullo pror&s;us cibo con&s;edit, ut inde a nemine amoveri potu|erit.</P>
<BIBL>Jac. Bergomen&s;is, page 61.</BIBL></NOTE>. Theoclia lamented, to the de&s;|tined hu&s;band of her daughter, this won|derful fa&s;cination. But the lover and the parent were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful in their attempts to divert the maiden from her attachment to the preacher. The morti|fied Thamirus departed in anger, to en|quire into the character and doctrine of this new prophet, who&s;e di&s;cour&s;e had
<PB N="145" REF="147">
produced &s;o marvellous an effect on his alienated mi&s;tre&s;s. Having learned that he was a Chri&s;tian, who, by his exhorta|tions, deterred virgins from wedlock, the indignant lover gave full &s;cope to his re|&s;entment, and delivered the preacher in bonds to the magi&s;trate Sextilius, by who&s;e order he was committed to pri&s;on. The devout Thecla, having bribed the gaoler, contrived &s;till to fea&s;t on the elo|quence of the impri&s;oned apo&s;tle. Being detected in her &s;ecret vi&s;its, &s;he was car|ried before the procon&s;ul; where, being &s;olicited to fulfil her engagement with Thamirus, &s;he di&s;dained to reply. The enraged procon&s;ul, ordering the apo&s;tle to be &s;courged, and driven from the city, condemned the ob&s;tinate virgin to peri&s;h in the flames. But Thecla, being already fortified by the in&s;tructions of Paul, and arming her&s;elf with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, e&s;caped unhurt and triumphant from the fire into which &s;he was thrown; and, quitting her native city, went to Antioch
<PB N="146" REF="148">
with Paul. The praefect of Antioch be|came enamoured of her beauty, and at|tempted to violate her cha&s;tity; but the re&s;olute virgin &s;o vigorou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted the princely ravi&s;her, that &s;he beat his crown from his head, tore his mantle a&s;under, and threw him into a &s;tate of idioti&s;m, or frenzy. She was now accu&s;ed of for|cery, and condemned to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts. She marched, however, un|daunted to her puni&s;hment; and happily found in her purity a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the fury of bears and lions. The heart of the procon&s;ul was &s;oftened by her mi|raculous pre&s;ervation; and &s;he obtained her freedom.&mdash;After the&s;e adventures, &s;he had a joyful meeting with her preceptor Paul at Smyrna; and, having received from him every in&s;truction that could ren|der her innocence more perfect, &s;he retired to Seleucia; where, having communicated her own virtues to many virgin compa|nions, &s;he clo&s;ed a life of &s;anctity, il|lu&s;trated by many miracles, in the month
<PB N="147" REF="149">
of October, and in the &s;ixty-ninth year of our Lord.</Q></P>
<P>Such is the hi&s;tory which a reverend en|comia&s;t of the fair &s;ex has given of this il|lu&s;trious virgin; and it corre&s;ponds with the account of other pious biographers, who have expatiated on the merits of the cha&s;te Thecla, in their various Lives of the Saints. The enlightened readers of our country will, perhaps, con&s;ider with an equal degree of incredulity the different ad|ventures of this wonderful maiden. It is hardly more probable that St. Paul &s;hould in&s;tigate a young dam&s;el to di&s;obey her pa|rent, and to violate a nuptial promi&s;e, than that the hungry and enraged bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t &s;hould be rendered harmle&s;s and gen|tle by the influence of virginity. But in whatever light the&s;e a&s;&s;erted facts may ap|pear to the intelligent readers of our age and country, it is certain they were re|ceived, during many centuries, with impli|cit belief and veneration. The extraordi|nary merits of Thecla were a favourite to|pic
<PB N="148" REF="150">
with many holy preachers, and St. Am|bro&s;e in particular de&s;cants upon them in &s;o high a &s;train, that his di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t have had great effect upon his virgin di&s;ciples. "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thecla doceat immolari, quae copulam fugiens nuptialem, et &s;pon&s;i furore damnata, naturam etiam be&s;tiarum virginitatis veneratione mutavit.

<Q>let Thecla teach you to &s;uffer martyrdom; who, flying from the bonds of matrimony, and condemned by the fury of her betrothed hu&s;band, changed even the nature of &s;avage bea&s;ts, by in&s;piring them with reverence for vir|ginity. When &s;he was expo&s;ed to be
<PB N="149" REF="151">
devoured, when &s;he &s;hrunk from the &s;ight of men, and offered her vitals to the lion, &s;he converted the cruel wan|tonne&s;s of the &s;pectators into a re&s;pect for mode&s;ty: then might you have &s;een a wild bea&s;t fawning at her feet, and te&s;|tifying, by a gentle murmur, that he had not power to violate the &s;acred body of a virgin. The &s;avage adored his prey, and, forgetting his own natural qualities, a&s;&s;umed that nature which man had thrown off. You might &s;ee, by this in|terchange

of nature, man a&s;&s;uming fero|city, and commanding a bea&s;t to be cruel; and a bea&s;t in&s;tructing man in his duty, by ki&s;&s;ing the feet of a virgin. So truly admirable is virginity, that even lions revere it! The &s;ight of their prey did not allure them, though exa&s;perated by hunger; anger did not provoke them, though &s;timulated by the rage of the people; their cu&s;tom of devouring criminals did not deceive them; their natural qualities cea&s;ed to operate upon them! They taught us religion, by adoring the martyr; they taught us even cha&s;tity, by confining their ki&s;&s;es to the feet of the maiden, declining their eyes to the earth, as if a&s;hamed that any male creature, though only a &s;avage bea&s;t, &s;hould look upon a naked virgin.</Q></P>
<P>When the merits of Thecla were thus celebrated by one of the mo&s;t popular and eloquent of the epi&s;copal &s;aints, we may rea&s;onably imagine that female ambition was univer&s;ally awakened: the warm ima|gination
<PB N="151" REF="153">
of pious maidens was heated to &s;uch a pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that a pa&s;&s;ion for the glory of martyrdom extingui&s;hed all their natural affections; in&s;tead of wi&s;hing to become the mothers of well-educated children, they de&s;ired only the purity and the renown of Thecla, to be adored by lions, and extolled by &s;aints. How far the mo&s;t eminent fathers of the church con|&s;pired to inflame and perpetuate this &s;uper|natural ambition in the tender &s;ex, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew in &s;ome &s;ucceeding chapters, concluding the pre&s;ent with a few remarks on the illu&s;trious Thecla.&mdash;This holy maiden, being celebrated as the fami|liar friend and di&s;ciple of an apo&s;tle, was generally con&s;idered as a model for every well-di&s;po&s;ed virgin; and, perhaps, in the very long li&s;t of female &s;aints, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to pitch on any individual, who&s;e mira|culous adventures had &s;o powerful an effect in diffu&s;ing an univer&s;al ardour for the ho|nours of virginity, and increa&s;ing the mul|titude of Old Maids.

<P>The next eminent Chri&s;tian writer, who treats expre&s;sly of virgins, is St. Cyprian; who has addre&s;&s;ed to them a di&s;cour&s;e of admonition on their conduct and apparel. The good bi&s;hop of Carthage declaims again&s;t ear-rings, paint, and fal&s;e hair, as inventions of the devil, incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;implicity of habit by which virgins &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed. He exhorts them to avoid public baths and nuptial fea&s;ts; he felicitates them on their e&s;caping the cur&s;e of child-birth; and encourages them to per&s;evere in their cha&s;tity, by an a&s;&s;ur|ance, that their rank is glorious, and that the purity of a virgin approaches very near to the per&s;everance of a martyr <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Quarum ad gloriam merces &s;ecunda e&s;t, &s;it et virtus ad tolerantiam proxima.</P>

<P><PB N="156" REF="158">Such is the general tenor of St. Cyprian's addre&s;s to the pious &s;i&s;terhood; but I can|not collect any light, either from Cyprian or Tertullian, concerning the number of Chri&s;tian females, who had in their times made a public profe&s;&s;ion of virginity. There are, however, two circum&s;tances, which may induce us to believe, that the&s;e holy maidens amounted, even at this pe|riod, to an immen&s;e multitude.&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, a veneration for celibacy was carried to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es in the &s;econd cen|tury, that many preachers declaimed again&s;t marriage as the &s;ugge&s;tion of the devil. This gloomy doctrine is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t taught by Saturninus of Antioch. The learned Bingham, in his Chri&s;tian Antiquities, has enumerated many &s;ects who were addicted to this, perhaps the mo&s;t ab&s;urd of all &s;uper&s;titions; which yet prevailed to &s;uch a degree, and was &s;o for|cibly &s;upported by Eu&s;tathius, a preacher of the fourth century, that, to u&s;e the words of Bingham,
<Q>many women for&s;ook their
<PB N="157" REF="159">
hu&s;bands, and hu&s;bands their wives, from the per&s;ua&s;ion, that no one who lived in a married &s;tate could have any hope in God.</Q></P>
<P>The prevalence of &s;uch an idea had cer|tainly a &s;trong tendency to increa&s;e the number of tho&s;e religious maidens, who, &s;till re&s;iding under the roof of their pa|rents, yet made a public profe&s;&s;ion of virgi|nity, by enrolling their names in the book or canon of the church, and thence ac|quired the title of Canonical Virgins.</P>
<P>But there was a &s;econd circum&s;tance, pe|culiar to this early period, which had, per|haps, an effect equally powerful and ex|ten&s;ive in augmenting this maiden commu|nity; I mean a very extraordinary cu&s;tom, which crept into the primitive church, to the &s;candal of the good, and the entertain|ment of the licentious, the cu&s;tom (con|demned indeed by &s;aints and councils, yet &s;ometimes avowed and vindicated by its adherents) which permitted the canonical virgins to attach them&s;elves to a favourite
<PB N="158" REF="160">
preceptor, and even to &s;hare his bed, with|out cea&s;ing to make a public profe&s;&s;ion of their virginity.</P>
<P>This fact is &s;o &s;ingular, that the modern &s;ceptical reader may incline, perhaps, to que&s;tion the truth of it. Many witne&s;&s;es concur in its &s;upport; and, as the con&s;idera|tion of &s;o &s;trange a cu&s;tom may in&s;truct us in the &s;tate of ancient manners, I doubt not but the more di&s;creet virgins of the pre&s;ent age will thank me for exhibiting to their view the very dangerous temerity of their primitive &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Among the Epi&s;tles of St. Cyprian, there is one addre&s;&s;ed to Pomponius, which &s;hews us, in very explicit language, the good bi&s;hop's opinion of the&s;e re&s;olute, or rather ra&s;h virgins, who, confe&s;&s;ing that they &s;lept with men, &s;till a&s;&s;erted their integrity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Quae &s;e cum viris dormi&s;&s;e confe&s;&s;ae &s;int, a&s;&s;eve|rare &s;e integras e&s;&s;e.</P>

From the&s;e &s;ingular expre&s;&s;ions, we may conceive how &s;trenuou&s;ly the canonical vir|gins contended for the maintenance of this tempting, though dangerous cu&s;tom, which, to u&s;e the metaphor of Dodwell,
<Q>had taken deep root in the church.</Q>
&mdash;This learned commentator on St. Cyprian has il|lu&s;trated
<PB N="160" REF="162">
the cu&s;tom, that I am now &s;peak|ing of, in a Latin di&s;&s;ertation. He affirms it was fir&s;t introduced into the Chri&s;tian church by Paul of Samo&s;ata, bi&s;hop of Antioch, who was perpetually attended by two of the&s;e fair and faithful virgin di&s;ciples. The practice became &s;o common, that the canonical virgins, who thus cohabited with their pa&s;tors, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a parti|cular Greek appellation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">,</NOTE>. Many of the fathers declaimed with great energy again&s;t this cla&s;s of virgins; and the eloquent St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, in particular, has left us an animated di&s;cour&s;e on this unorthodox co|habitation, divided into two parts; the fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed to females, and the &s;econd, to his own &s;ex. From this divi&s;ion, it &s;eems pro|bable, that the more wealthy pious maidens admitted indigent preachers to re&s;ide under their roof; while, on the other hand, the wealthy prie&s;t afforded a &s;imilar refuge to the poor canonical virgin. This friendly
<PB N="161" REF="163">
and tender intercour&s;e was often perhaps very innocent; but, as it afforded much room for licentious &s;urmi&s;es again&s;t the clergy, it was expre&s;sly prohibited by the council of Nice. The warm and eloquent Chry&s;o&s;tom begins his addre&s;s to the&s;e in|con&s;iderate virgins with the mo&s;t pathetic lamentation:&mdash;
<Q>Virginity (&s;ays the indig|nant &s;aint) the mo&s;t honourable of all conditions, has now incurred the mo&s;t humiliating di&s;grace; and it &s;uffers, not from its enemies, but from tho&s;e who &s;till pre&s;ume to profe&s;s them&s;elves its faithful votaries.&mdash;There were a few individuals among the Greeks, who, by the aid of philo&s;ophy, were enabled to triumph over avarice and anger; but the flower of virginity never flouri&s;hed among them. In this point they have always acknow|ledged our manife&s;t &s;uperiority; confe&s;|&s;ing that &s;uch purity was above the reach of nature, and did not belong <HI>to our &s;pe|cies</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>. It was in this point that all the

Gentiles have marvelled at our perfec|tion&mdash;but they can admire it no longer; and their admiration is turned into laughter and deri&s;ion. The devil at|tacked us in this band, becau&s;e he per|ceived that our virgins were the mo&s;t ef|fulgent phalanx in all the ho&s;t of Chri&s;|tians; but he has &s;o confounded this phalanx, that it <HI>would be better for us in future to have no virgins at all, if they can thus be driven to neglect their duty</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>. The cau&s;e of all the&s;e evils is this, that virgin purity exi&s;ts only in name, while the e&s;|&s;ence of it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be confined to the body, which is the lea&s;t part of vir|ginity: the more e&s;&s;ential parts, and tho&s;e which chiefly denote it, are di&s;|regarded; they have cea&s;ed to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by decency of habit, by the &s;ilence which becomes a virgin, by compunction, and other marks of a reli|gious &s;pirit.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165">Such is the language, in which St. Chry|&s;o&s;tom begins his exhortation to tho&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ed virgins, who permitted men to dwell under their roof: in the cour&s;e of it, the &s;aint grows &s;o vehement in his anger, as even to hint at burying the fair offenders alive; but, &s;ince that privilege is not al|lowed him, he contents him&s;elf with indig|nant lamentation.

<P>What a di&s;gu&s;ting idea of the fourth cen|tury (the age of Chry&s;o&s;tom) does this anecdote pre&s;ent to us! I have tran&s;lated this &s;ingular pa&s;&s;age from the &s;aint very faithfully, for my maiden readers, at the ex|treme hazard of offending their delicacy&mdash; I have ventured to incur this painful ha|zard, in the hope of thus guarding them again&s;t an infirmity, which is &s;ometimes objected to Old Maids; I mean the infir|mity of railing again&s;t their own time, and preferring pa&s;t ages to the pre&s;ent. The good &s;pin&s;ter, who ju&s;tly con&s;iders the point of view in which St. Chry&s;o&s;tom exhibits the virgins of his century, will ble&s;s her &s;tars that &s;he was born in our happier days, when the dignity of the virgin character is &s;upported with more ea&s;e and grace, and when the calumniated maiden can gain

credit for her innocence, without being re|duced to &s;uch a &s;hameful te&s;t of her inte|grity. The &s;evere St. Chry&s;o&s;tom would not allow the opulent virgin to retain even a male &s;ervant under her roof. He laughs at tho&s;e who made the infirmity of their health a plea for this indulgence; and he draws a very ludicrous picture of tho&s;e noc|turnal occurrences, which his warm imagi|nation &s;ugge&s;ted to him as ari&s;ing in the hou&s;es, where the virgin mi&s;tre&s;s was at|tended by a male dome&s;tic.

<P>Saint Chry&s;o&s;tom, in the &s;econd part of his di&s;cour&s;e, where he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the prie&s;ts who kept canonical virgins un|der their roof, very candidly acknowledges, that it is plea&s;ant to re&s;ide with women, ex|clu&s;ive of any matrimonial or licentious en|joyment; but he endeavours to convince the clergy, who indulged them&s;elves in this tem|perate plea&s;ure, and a&s;&s;erted its innocence, that their condition was little better than that of Tantalus. He enumerates the ma|ny evils that may ari&s;e to man from re&s;iding with a female, even without a violation of their mutual cha&s;tity; and he compares a prie&s;t, who has enervated his mind by &s;uch a gratification, to a poor lion, who&s;e mane has been cut off, who&s;e teeth and talons have

been taken from him, and who is metamor|pho&s;ed from the tremendous lord of the fo|re&s;t into a wretched animal weak and ridi|culous.</P>
<P>Vigilant and &s;olicitous as the fathers were to prevent this dome&s;tic connection between the prie&s;ts and virgins, there were many ob|&s;tinate offenders, who re&s;i&s;ted and de&s;pi&s;ed their public exhortations, and their private advice. The authority of the great St. Ba&s;il him&s;elf was not &s;ufficient to prevail on an aged prie&s;t, who&s;e name was Paregorius, to di&s;mi&s;s a canonical virgin re&s;iding in his hou&s;e: it appears, from a letter &s;till extant, addre&s;&s;ed by St. Ba&s;il to this old delinquent, that he pleaded the age of &s;eventy as his ex|cu&s;e, and re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed the &s;everity of his malicious &s;uperior, who had attempted to rob his declining life of &s;o innocent a comfort. St. Ba&s;il, however, is very far from admitting this apology; and clo&s;es his letter with a vehement threat of excom|munication, if the aged Paregorius &s;till
<PB N="169" REF="171">
fondly per&s;i&s;ted in his attachment to his fair attendant.</P>
<P>Love and religion are often found toge|ther; and are never, perhaps, &s;o warm and vehement, as when they are united. The prie&s;t, who attached him&s;elf to a canonical virgin, with the endearing appellation of &s;i&s;ter, was gradually, and perhaps in&s;en&s;ibly, led to the highe&s;t pitch of di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;|&s;ion. The writings of Athana&s;ius have incidentally pre&s;erved to us a very me|morable example of the &s;trange exce&s;&s;es that may ari&s;e from this ardent affection: &mdash;The archbi&s;hop of Alexandria, declaim|ing again&s;t the wickedne&s;s and impudence of his antagoni&s;ts the Arians, in his fir&s;t apo|logy, a&s;&s;erts that, in&s;tead of being a&s;hamed of the crimes imputed to them, they per&s;e|vered, without a blu&s;h, in their offences. "Leontius," continues the primate,
<Q>be|ing cen&s;ured on account of a young woman called Eu&s;tolia, and forbid to cohabit with her, <HI>made him&s;elf a eunuch
<PB N="170" REF="172">

In his epi&s;tle to the Monks, Athana&s;ius &s;peaks again of this di&s;intere&s;ted lover; and he there expre&s;sly affirms, that
<Q>Leontius had made this voluntary &s;acrifice of him&s;elf for the liberty of &s;leeping with Eu&s;tolia, his wife, according to his own account,</Q>
(&s;ays the angry Saint)
<Q>though &s;till called a virgin.</Q>
&mdash;The good-natured reader, who will con&s;ider the generous frailty of Leontius with le&s;s &s;everity than Athana&s;ius did, may rejoice, perhaps, to be informed, that the lo&s;s of manhood did not prevent this affectionate enthu&s;ia&s;t from ri&s;ing to a mitre.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. On Methodius, Bi&s;hop of Olympus, and his Banquet of Virgins.</HEAD>
<P>A SPIRIT of pious gallantry &s;o in|flamed the fir&s;t writers of the church, that their pens were ince&s;&s;antly employed in the prai&s;e of con&s;ecrated virgins. Among the early epi&s;copal champions of the &s;i&s;ter|hood, Methodius was particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the purity of his zeal, and the Platonic form of his compo&s;ition. We have but few per&s;onal circum&s;tances tran&s;|mitted to us concerning this elegant enco|mia&s;t of virginity; who being fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Olympus, and afterwards of Tyre, clo&s;ed his &s;cene of religious glory by acquiring the palm of martyrdom in the per&s;ecution of Diocle&s;ian. Of the many writings which he is &s;aid to have left, one alone has e&s;caped the ravages of time, and this, although its
<PB N="175" REF="177">
title was &s;ufficient to awaken curio&s;ity and regard, did not find an editor till about the middle of the la&s;t century: it is entitled, "The Banquet of Virgins," and bears an evident re&s;emblance to the celebrated Ban|quet of Plato. Love had formed the great theme of panegyric in the dialogue of the Pagan philo&s;opher, and virginity is treated in a &s;imilar manner in the cha&s;ter compo&s;i|tion of the Chri&s;tian bi&s;hop. I tru&s;t, that my fair readers will eagerly receive an ac|count of this curious performance, and the more &s;o, if I fir&s;t relate to them an anecdote, from which it will appear, that the Ban|quet of Virgins, even before its publication, attracted the attention of a queen, a famous and learned queen, who had the ambition, like our Elizabeth, to rank her&s;elf in the order of Old Maids, though on a very du|bious and di&s;puted title.</P>
<P>In the Paris edition of Methodius by Pierre Pou&s;&s;ines, a French Je&s;uit, who re|&s;ided at Rome, there is a letter from the editor to his friend Henri de Valois, which
<PB N="176" REF="178">
gives an amu&s;ing account of a literary morning, that he pa&s;&s;ed in the Vatican li|brary with &s;everal men of letters, and their royal patrone&s;s Chri&s;tina of Sweden. Among the curious volumes that Hol&s;ten, the librarian, pre&s;ented to the company, there was a copy of Methodius: on the &s;ight of it, the queen of Sweden &s;aid im|mediately to Pou&s;&s;ines,
<Q>Here is the book that we eagerly expect from you,</Q>
al|luding to his tran&s;lation of the Greek text, which he had ju&s;t completed, at the reque&s;t of his friend the librarian. Before the Je&s;uit could reply to this flattering compliment, a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed learn|ing, he tells us, interpo&s;ed in this mortify|ing manner:
<Q>From me, mo&s;t illu&s;trious queen, is the Banquet of Methodius to be expected; I have occupied this ground, nor &s;hall I yield it to any one.</Q>
&mdash;"I was &s;truck dumb," &s;ays the unlucky Je&s;uit,
<Q>I confe&s;s; for how could I op|po&s;e a per&s;on, my &s;uperior in age, con|nected with me in friend&s;hip, a favourite
<PB N="177" REF="179">
at Rome, and honoured, indeed, in all countries for his &s;ingular merit. While I was inwardly lamenting my own fruit|le&s;s labour,</Q>
continues Pou&s;&s;ines,
<Q>the queen took me a&s;ide, and &s;aid, "What can we do in this bu&s;ine&s;s? have you no expedient to propo&s;e?"</Q>
&mdash;"None," replied the mode&s;t though mortified Je&s;uit,

<P>As I fear the majority of modern readers would not reli&s;h the pious prolixity of the&s;e rhetorical virgins, I &s;hall only introduce a little &s;ummary of their re&s;pective orations.</P>
<P>Marcella begins her di&s;cour&s;e with an a&s;&s;ertion, that virginity is &s;upernaturally great, wonderful, and glorious, and that it requires a lofty &s;oul to &s;upport it. She con&s;iders it as a plant &s;ent immediately from Heaven, and unknown to the fir&s;t ages of the world. She repre&s;ents God as purifying human nature by degrees, like a
<PB N="186" REF="188">
ma&s;ter leading his infant &s;cholars through the rudiments of language to the &s;ub|lime&s;t contemplations; permitting, in the infancy of the world, promi&s;cuous marriage between brothers and &s;i&s;ters, refining wed|lock by degrees, and at length recommend|ing, in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, a life of volun|tary continence, as the &s;ummit of rational perfection. She concludes with a long pa&s;&s;age from the fourteenth chapter of Re|velations, to prove that the order of virgins has the fir&s;t di&s;tinction in heaven, though inferior in number to other &s;ocieties in the cele&s;tial ho&s;t.</P>
<P>Theophila, the &s;econd of the female ora|tors, con&s;idering the &s;peech of Marcella as a little too &s;evere upon marriage, a&s;&s;erts the innocence and the dignity of procreation, in language that di&s;covers her to be a won|derful adept in all the my&s;teries of nature, particularly as &s;he &s;peaks in the character of a &s;eque&s;tered virgin. She is interrupted by Marcella; and the two maidens enter into &s;ome altercation on the po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="187" REF="189">
producing an infant in oppo&s;ition to the will of God. Theophila adju&s;ts their dif|ference by illu&s;trating, in a figurative man|ner, the formation of an embryo: &s;he vin|dicates the human frame as the exqui&s;ite work of divine power; &s;he affirms, that even tho&s;e children who are licentiou&s;ly be|gotten, are a&s;&s;igned to the protection of tu|telary angels; &s;he compares the church to a rich and variegated field, adorned with the <HI>flowers both of continence and propaga|tion</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>: but, although &s;he maintains the ho|nour of marriage, &s;he concludes with de|claring the pre-eminence of virginity.</P>
<P>The third &s;peaker is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the poetical name of Thalia; who is anxious to obviate the ill effects which &s;he &s;uppo&s;es to have ari&s;en from a mi&s;con&s;truction of the divine command, <HI>Increa&s;e and multiply.</HI> For this purpo&s;e &s;he contends, that all things &s;aid of Adam and Eve, in the Mo&s;aic hi&s;|tory, &s;hould be under&s;tood in a figurative
<PB N="188" REF="190">
&s;en&s;e, as alluding to the connection between Chri&s;t and the church. Thalia then exa|mines and illu&s;trates the art, the energy, and the de&s;ign of St. Paul, in his exhorta|tion to celibacy; &s;he in&s;i&s;ts on his expre&s;|&s;ion, <HI>It is good for a man not to touch a wo|man</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 7.</NOTE>; and &s;he contends, that the apo&s;tle's allowance of wedlock is like an indulgence granted to the &s;ick, of eating forbidden food upon a &s;olemn fa&s;t.&mdash;Such are the heads of Thalia's oration; which is, how|ever, &s;o copious, that Eubulius exclaims, when the recital of it is fini&s;hed,
<Q>Well, Gregorium, &s;he has at la&s;t reached the &s;hore, after traver&s;ing a wide ocean of words!</Q>
The good man expre&s;&s;es, at the &s;ame time, an eager de&s;ire to hear the re&s;idue of the&s;e cha&s;te and pious harangues: upon which Gregorium proceeds to the &s;peech of Theopatra. This virgin delivers only a conci&s;e encomium on cha&s;tity, with a few texts of &s;cripture very fancifully in|terpreted.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="191">Thallu&s;a, the fifth orator, enforces many religious precepts for the conduct of a maiden's life; and concludes with ob&s;erv|ing, that gold is an excellent &s;ymbol of vir|ginity, in two particulars; fir&s;t, as it is of a &s;hining nature, and, &s;econdly, not &s;ubject to ru&s;t.</P>
<P>Agatha, who now takes her part in the dialogue, gives a &s;ingular caution to her own &s;ex, by remarking, <HI>that lovers are the devil and his agents</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c.</NOTE>; a po&s;ition which &s;he endeavours to illu&s;trate by a prolix and cu|rious comment on the parable of the wi&s;e and fooli&s;h virgins in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Procilla, who &s;peaks in the &s;eventh place, repre&s;ents Chri&s;t as the great encomia&s;t of virginity, by a &s;trange mi&s;application of the uxorious poetry of Solomon.</P>

religious doctrine, and particularly in|&s;tructed by the apo&s;tle St. Paul. The &s;peech of Thecla is far from an&s;wering the expectation which her character excites. She begins with a kind of pun on the Greek word which expre&s;&s;es virginity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>; &s;he proceeds to a di&s;&s;ertation on the great and red dragon of the Apocalyp&s;e, exhort|ing all virgins to the mo&s;t re&s;olute re&s;i&s;t|ance of this formidable mon&s;ter. Having concluded what &s;he had to advance on the general topic, &s;he de&s;ires permi&s;&s;ion to pro|nounce a &s;econd di&s;cour&s;e, again&s;t a vain and wicked belief in the influence of the &s;tars; and &s;he &s;upports, with &s;o much &s;pirit, the free agency of man, that Eubulius ex|pre&s;&s;es his admiration, in a lively panegyric on the force and &s;plendor of her eloquence.</P>

<P>Domnina, the tenth and la&s;t among the
<PB N="191" REF="193">
gue&s;ts of Arete, begins her di&s;cour&s;e by de|claring, that no per&s;on under the old law could be acceptable to God, nor till virgi|nity, under the au&s;pices of Chri&s;t, began to reign over nature. She affirms, that this happy dominion of cha&s;tity was clearly foretold in the book of Judges, by the fable of the trees electing a &s;overeign; alledging, that the plant Rhamnus, which in our ver|&s;ion of the Bible is denominated <HI>the bramble,</HI> is a ju&s;t and proper &s;ymbol of virginity.</P>
<P>Arete now clo&s;es the conver&s;ation, by remarking, that purity of mind and body are equally e&s;&s;ential to con&s;titute the per|fect virgin. She proceeds to commend and to crown the ten maiden orators; and the entertainment concludes with religious &s;ing|ing, Thecla taking the principal part, and the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly joining in the fol|lowing chorus, which is frequently re|peated:</P>
<P><Q>For thee I am cha&s;te; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a re&s;plendent lamp, O bridegroom, I ri&s;e to meet thee.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="194">Upon Gregorium's fini&s;hing her account of the banquet, Eubulius &s;tarts this curious and delicate que&s;tion:

<P>Gregorium ha&s;tily decides in favour of the fir&s;t; but Eubulius arguing the point with her, much in the manner of Plato, at la&s;t convinces her, by allu&s;ions to the phy|&s;ician who &s;ubdues a fever, and to the pilot who pa&s;&s;es through a &s;torm, that the palm of honour is certainly due to tho&s;e maidens who have laboured through a fiery trial, and &s;ucce&s;sfully contended with an impe|rious pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. On the Saints who have written Panegyrics on Virginity&mdash;St. Athana&s;ius.</HEAD>
<P>AS many mo&s;t eminent fathers of the church appear to have contended for the palm of eloquence on this tempting ground, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively exerted all their powers of per&s;ua&s;ion in magnifying the merits of virginity, I intend to give a little &s;ketch of their re&s;pective compo&s;itions, in chronological order.&mdash;The next holy en|comia&s;t, who &s;eems to have honoured the canonical virgins with an expre&s;s panegyric, is the celebrated Athana&s;ius, who became bi&s;hop of Alexandria in the year 326. Though we find, in the printed works of this illu&s;trious &s;aint, a little treati&s;e in prai&s;e of virginity, it is proper to remark, that the mo&s;t judicious of the Catholic critics will not allow this to be the genuine production
<PB N="195" REF="197">
of Athana&s;ius. It con&s;i&s;ts of good advice to the pious virgin on the articles of dre&s;s and prayer; it exhorts her never to plunge her whole body into water, nor to take even the liberty of looking at her&s;elf when &s;he is naked.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of holy meditation, Athana|&s;ius, or whoever the author may be, has a pa&s;&s;age that &s;trikes me as &s;ublime:
<Q>Re|member,</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q>the twelfth hour; for in that our Saviour de&s;cended into hell; hell &s;huddered in beholding him, and cried aloud, Who is he that cometh with great power? who is he that tram|pleth on the brazen portals of hell, and unbindeth the chain of my captives?</Q></P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of this treati&s;e, after deliver|ing many precepts in a very clear and &s;imple &s;tyle, the author breaks forth into a fervid and magnificent panegyric on virginity, which he calls a precious pearl, not vi&s;ible to the multitude, and found only by few <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">!</NOTE>.
<PB N="196" REF="198">
He concludes with the following remarkable expre&s;&s;ion:
<Q>The&s;e things have I written to thee, my dear &s;i&s;ter, thou <HI>dancing girl of Chri&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>.</Q>
The learned Dupin con&s;i|ders this indecent metaphor as a proof that the treati&s;e in que&s;tion is not the genuine work of Athana&s;ius.</P>
<P>But if &s;uch an argument were &s;ufficient to prove a &s;aint not the author of produc|tions a&s;cribed to him, the whole band of &s;aintly writers might be almo&s;t reduced to nothing, &s;ince the zeal of the Catholic fa|thers, even when they are prai&s;ing conti|nence, is very apt to hurry them into the u&s;e of an indelicate or voluptuous image.</P>
<P>If the treati&s;e in que&s;tion is not, in truth, a work of Athana&s;ius, it contains, however, &s;uch &s;entiments on the &s;ubject as he is known to have profe&s;&s;ed. In one unque&s;|tioned production of this illu&s;trious &s;aint, there is a pa&s;&s;age which not only &s;hews his unbounded re&s;pect for virginity, but ex|plains
<PB N="197" REF="199">
to us, in &s;ome degree, the rea&s;on of that extraordinary and indefatigable ardour with which the fathers in general allured the young females of their time into an eternal ab&s;tinence from wedlock.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of his apology to the emperor Con&s;tantius, the &s;pirited Athana&s;ius inveighs with great indignation again&s;t the gro&s;s in|juries which the religious virgins had &s;uf|fered from their Arian per&s;ecutors; and he introduces his animated invective again&s;t the brutality of the&s;e ruffians, by a &s;hort but &s;ignificant encomium on the virgi|nity which they in&s;ulted.
<Q>The Catholic church,</Q>
&s;ays the indignant &s;aint,
<Q>is ac|cu&s;tomed to call the females, who po&s;|&s;e&s;s this virtue, the &s;pou&s;es of Chri&s;t; and even the Gentiles look upon them with wonder, as the temple of the <HI>Word</HI>; for in no other &s;ect is the venerable and heavenly profe&s;&s;ion ju&s;tly &s;upported, but among us Chri&s;tians alone; <HI>and this, therefore, is a great and particular evidence,
<PB N="198" REF="200">

<P>We can no longer wonder at the eager|ne&s;s of the fathers to increa&s;e the multitude of mona&s;tic virgins, when we find they could thus produce them as an argument to confirm the truth of Chri&s;tianity. Hi&s;tory, perhaps, can hardly &s;hew us a more lament|able abu&s;e of rea&s;on than this, by which an in&s;titution, certainly incon&s;i&s;tent with the general good of mankind, and of cour&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent with the genuine &s;pirit and prin|ciples of our benevolent religion, is un|worthily called a &s;trong evidence of its truth.</P>
<P>It is plain, from this pa&s;&s;age, that Atha|na&s;ius gave little or no credit to profe&s;&s;ions of virginity among the heathen; and his a&s;&s;ertion, to con&s;ider it in a more ludicrous

light, is certainly uncandid towards the Pa|gan Old Maids.

As this is the prime idea, on which almo&s;t all the fathers have grounded their exce&s;&s;ive prai&s;es of mona&s;tic celibacy, I &s;hall digre&s;s into one ob&s;ervation con|cerning it.&mdash;Although this idea had cer|tainly a very dazzling effect, when embel|li&s;hed by &s;aintly eloquence; yet, if ju&s;tly examined, it exhibits, to a mind not tinc|tured with &s;uper&s;tition, a very ludicrous ab&s;urdity; for in truth it is &s;aying, that a human being can only re&s;emble the great Author of all things, by producing nothing. Surely it would be more con&s;i&s;tent, both with rea&s;on and piety, to &s;ay, that if human weakne&s;s may in any degree a&s;pire to an humble re&s;emblance of the Divine nature, it mu&s;t be in the tender and faithful di&s;charge of tho&s;e duties which belong to the paren|tal character.&mdash;But I return to St. Ba&s;il.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. On St. Gregory Nazianzen, and his Poem in Prai&s;e of Virginity.&mdash;On &s;ome Latin Poets of the dark Ages, who have written on the &s;ame Subject.</HEAD>
<P>THE next holy encomia&s;t of virginity may undoubtedly be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t extraordinary per&s;on that ever re|flected lu&s;tre on the annals of the church; for he united two characters in him&s;elf, which &s;ome moro&s;e critics of modern times have &s;uppo&s;ed incompatible, and was both a &s;aint and a poet. I mean the illu&s;trious Gregory Nazianzen, the friend of the great St. Ba&s;il; who&s;e epitaph he has written, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t affectionate and pathetic ver&s;es that friend&s;hip ever in&s;pired; a com|po&s;ition that does the more honour to this canonized poet, as Ba&s;il had mortified his ingenuous pride, by placing him in the
<PB N="210" REF="212">
wretched and ob&s;cure bi&s;hopric of Sa&s;ima; which he afterwards exchanged for the epi&s;|copal throne of Con&s;tantinople, an irk&s;ome though &s;plendid elevation; from whence he retired, in the year 381, to poetical &s;olitude in the wilds of Cappadocia, where he clo&s;ed his remarkable life, in 389, at the age of &s;ixty-two.</P>
<P>Among the various productions of this &s;ainted bard, we have a panegyric on vir|ginity, containing about &s;even hundred ver&s;es. A &s;light &s;ketch of this poem will, I tru&s;t, be amu&s;ing to my fair and curious readers. It opens with an air of triumph:
<Q><LG>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c.</NOTE>Our palms, Virginity! &s;hall bind thy brow:</L>
<L>From the pure heart flow with melodious joy,</L>

<L>'Tis this that bur&s;ts the bondage of the world,</L>

<L>All hail, Virginity! from God deriv'd,</L>
<L>Giver thy&s;elf of good! of Innocence</L>
<L>The lovely parent, and a&s;&s;ociate fit</L>
<L>For the unfetter'd &s;anctities of Heaven!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The poet proceeds to de&s;cant on the heavenly powers, and to celebrate the vir|ginity of the angels. He then touches on the evils that ari&s;e from the fle&s;h, giving a &s;hort account of the fir&s;t formation of man, and the incarnation of Chri&s;t; he con&s;iders our Saviour as coming to in&s;truct the world in the principles and practice of true virgi|nity, "a condition," &s;ays the poetical &s;aint,
<Q>as much &s;uperior to marriage as heaven is to earth, and a Divinity to a mortal.</Q></P>
<P>After thus magnifying the merits of con|tinence, the poet indulges him&s;elf in bold and &s;pirited per&s;onification. He introduces Marriage and Celibacy pleading in oppo|&s;ition
<PB N="212" REF="214">
to each other;&mdash;Marriage &s;peaks fir&s;t, and the poet &s;eems to act fairly, by throwing into this harangue many forcible arguments in its favour; but, as I am un|willing to tre&s;pa&s;s on the patience of my readers, and apprehend that &s;ome of them may not reli&s;h a very prolix &s;pecimen from the poetry of a &s;aint, I &s;hall only tran&s;late the ver&s;es in which Virginity is introduced as replying to Marriage, and a few of the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages in her &s;peech.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>With this vindication of her own hal|lowed dignity, Virginity begins her reply; profe&s;&s;ing to di&s;regard the opinions of men, &s;he declares that &s;he would not conde|&s;cend to an&s;wer her antagoni&s;t, did &s;he not tremble

<L>To earth, the victim of this artful lure.</L></Q></P>
<P>On this con&s;ideration &s;he enters on a long attempt to refute all the arguments which had been alledged by Marriage, her per&s;ua&s;ive opponent. She begins, by a &s;ubtle di&s;tinction, to invalidate the plea of utility and delight ari&s;ing from the pro|duction of children: &s;he affirms, that parents are parents only of the <HI>bodies,</HI> not the <HI>minds,</HI> of their offspring; and, as a proof of this, &s;he a&s;&s;erts, that they only la|ment the bodily infirmities, and not the mental di&s;orders, of their progeny.</P>
<P>This &s;atirical reflection on parental folly hardly affords &s;ufficient ground for the infe|rence which the fair pleader wi&s;hes to draw from it; but Virginity begins to argue with
<PB N="215" REF="217">
more &s;ound rea&s;on, and with more poetical &s;pirit al&s;o, when &s;he exclaims,
<Q><LG>

<L>From perfect &s;eed the happy farmer rears</L>
<L>The perfect grain, that an&s;wers to his hope:</L>
<L>But the vain mortal, who would leave on earth</L>
<L>A copy of him&s;elf (however great</L>

<LG>
<L>No&mdash;infants are not moulded to the wi&s;h</L>
<L>Of a fond parent; but, as one who &s;eeks</L>

<L>At the bare option of its votaries,</L>
<L>But as the &s;ecret laws, or the caprice</L>
<L>Of nature may determine.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn the uncertainty of tho&s;e parental delights, on which Marriage appeared to pride it&s;elf, Virginity proceeds to a magnificent encomium on her own &s;uperior plea&s;ures, her own beauty and ex|cellence as the cha&s;te &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t. She then enumerates all the mi&s;eries that can ari&s;e from the various incidents of married life. She concludes her oration by exhorting all who regard her to per&s;evere in a &s;ingle &s;tate, and to place them&s;elves in Paradi&s;e by the merits of cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>The poet declares, that tho&s;e who heard the two pleaders, be&s;towed the palm on Virginity. He concludes his poem, how|ever, in a manner much more candid than we might have expected from one pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="217" REF="219">
of it, in which Chri&s;t is &s;aid to have been born of a virgin, that <HI>marriage might &s;ink to the ground</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>; for, in the three la&s;t ver&s;es of this &s;ingular compo&s;ition, he introduces our Saviour acting as a kind of moderator be|tween the di&s;putants, by &s;eating Marriage on his left hand, and Virginity on his right.</P>
<P>It is not in this panegyric alone that our poetical &s;aint has expre&s;&s;ed his affection to virginity: he has written poems of admo|nition to virgins, containing many hundred ver&s;es. The points he chiefly recommends are, plainne&s;s of apparel, and a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;olitude and &s;ilence. He encourages his di&s;|ciples to triumph over all the licentious pa&s;&s;ions, by reminding them of the &s;ucce&s;s with which human re&s;olution has &s;ubdued the mo&s;t furious of the &s;avage bea&s;ts; as an example of this, he affirms, that he has &s;een a man riding a lion like a hor&s;e, and a bear

<P>The orations of this illu&s;trious father contain al&s;o many proofs of his ince&s;&s;ant attention to the intere&s;ts of virginity; but the tender compa&s;&s;ion with which he con&s;i|dered the &s;ufferings of the &s;i&s;terhood, under the apo&s;tate Julian, &s;eems to have rendered him too credulous. In his fir&s;t invective again&s;t that deluded monarch, he gives an account of &s;ome outrages inflicted on Chri&s;|tian virgins, too horrid to be related in this work, and, I am per&s;uaded, too &s;avage to be true.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the warm heart and the elegant genius of this holy bard, we cannot but regret that he did not live in a period more propitious to the cultivation and the di&s;play of his many amiable talents.</P>
<P>As I have devoted this chapter to a poe|tical encomia&s;t of cha&s;tity, I &s;hall here
<PB N="219" REF="221">
break through the chronological line which I intended to ob&s;erve, for the &s;ake of exhi|biting, in one point of view, the little group of poets who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively celebrated this maidenly perfection.</P>
<P>Be not alarmed, my good reader; I mean not to trouble thee with a long hi&s;tory of all the woeful ver&s;e, which the idle monks have &s;cribbled on the continence of every &s;ainted abbe&s;s; for though their fictions are often bold, their poetry is &s;eldom enter|taining.</P>
<P>Allow me, however, to terminate this volume with a brief account of the mo&s;t remarkable characters in the mona&s;tic quire of cha&s;te and pious bards, who re-echoed, through the dark ages, the ince&s;&s;ant prai&s;e of virginity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, both in per&s;onal rank and in point of time, is Sextus Alcimus Avitus, nephew to the unfortunate emperor of that name. The poet became arch|bi&s;hop of Vienna, and, after acting a very bu&s;y and important part in the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="220" REF="222">
world, died, with a great reputation for &s;anctity, in the year 525. This venerable bard has addre&s;&s;ed to his &s;i&s;ter Fu&s;cina a poetical exhortation to mona&s;tic virginity; a &s;tate to which, he tells us, many females of his family had been devoted. He excites the young Fu&s;cina to the virtues, that may become her religious character, by various examples; and, to teach her a brave con|tempt for unmerited calumny, he relates the following very &s;ingular anecdote; which I have &s;elected, as the only amu&s;ing pa&s;&s;age in his long compo&s;ition:

<P><PB N="225" REF="227">The &s;ingular adventure of this female abbot will, I think, induce my reader to wi&s;h for a few more particulars relating to &s;o intere&s;ting a per&s;onage; and, by the aid of that pious and gallant hi&s;torian of holy virgins, Arthur du Mon&s;tier, I am enabled to add, that Eugenia was the daughter of Philip, a Roman of high rank, who was praefect of Alexandria in the reign of Com|modus. She was di&s;tingui&s;hed by her per|&s;onal beauty, and adorned with every men|tal accompli&s;hment: her application to li|terature was great; her memory uncommon|ly retentive; and &s;he was equally eloquent in the Greek and Latin language. With the&s;e attractions, at the age of fifteen &s;he was demanded in marriage by Aquilius, the &s;on of Aquilius the con&s;ul; but the young Eugenia, being converted to Chri&s;tianity, made her e&s;cape privately from her heathen parents, and, di&s;gui&s;ing her&s;elf in the habit of a man, took refuge in a religious hou&s;e, not far from Alexandria. Here &s;he met with the remarkable occurrences recorded
<PB N="226" REF="228">
in the poetry of Avitus. It is &s;aid that &s;he converted both her parents to her new re|ligion; that her father &s;uffered martyr|dom; and that Eugenia her&s;elf, returning to Rome with her mother, who&s;e name was Claudia, experienced the &s;ame fate, in the reign of Gallienus.&mdash;Such is the account given of Eugenia in the curious work of Du Mon&s;tier, intitled, Sacrum Gynecaeum, a pious biographical trea&s;ure, containing all the &s;anctified females of the Chri&s;tian world. Her merits are celebrated by almo&s;t every writer who has touched upon the Catholic virgins; and her name is mentioned with honour by two &s;ucceeding Latin poets, of whom I am now to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is Venantius Fortu|natus, a poet on who&s;e hi&s;tory I enter the more willingly, as it is connected with that of a fair lady, who, if &s;he were an Old Maid, as &s;ome of her biographers have a&s;|&s;erted, was undoubtedly among the mo&s;t remarkable of the &s;i&s;terhood, being at once a queen and a &s;aint, a virgin and a wife.
<PB N="227" REF="229">
This &s;ingular per&s;onage was the lovely prin|ce&s;s Radegunda; who, being taken pri|&s;oner in her infancy by Clotaire, king of the Franks, was married in Soi&s;&s;ons, at the age of fifteen, and in the year 538, to that &s;avage hero, the de&s;troyer of her father's kingdom, and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of her brother. This unfortunate prince&s;s is univer&s;ally de|&s;cribed as a model of beauty; but her per|&s;onal charms were &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by her piety. She wore an under ve&s;t of hair-cloth, and loaded her delicate body with a chain of iron. Du Mon&s;tier affirms, that although &s;he lived a few years with the king her hu&s;|band, &s;he obtained from that amorous mo|narch the privilege of remaining a virgin. The more modern author of that amu&s;ing book, intitled "Anecdotes of the Queens of France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes des Reines et Regentes de France, 6 tom. 1776.</NOTE>", is inclined to prove the fal&s;hood of this problematical fact, by the expre&s;|&s;ions of her fir&s;t biographers, who de&s;cribe
<PB N="228" REF="230">
her as ri&s;ing early from the bed of the king. But without venturing to decide on &s;o nice a que&s;tion, I &s;hall proceed in the more cer|tain hi&s;tory of Radegunda.&mdash;After re&s;iding three years with Clotaire, &s;he obtained his permi&s;&s;ion to retire; and, founding an abbey at Poitiers, &s;he enjoyed in it all the tran|quil plea&s;ures of religious retirement. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an affection for literature; and &s;he was happy in the &s;ociety of two the mo&s;t eminent authors of that age, Gregory bi&s;hop of Tours, the hi&s;torian, and Fortunatus the poet, who had the honour of being &s;ecretary to the pious Radegunda, and was promoted to the bi&s;hopric of Poitiers.</P>
<P>Fortunatus was an Italian, of an elegant mind and in&s;inuating manners: it was pro|bably to flatter the cha&s;te fancy of his royal mi&s;tre&s;s, that he compo&s;ed his &s;ingular poem "On a cele&s;tial Synod, and the Virtue of Virginity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>De Senatu Curiae caele&s;tis, et Virtute Virginitatis.</P>

with a full convocation of all the eminent heavenly virgins and martyrs; when they are a&s;&s;embled before the throne of God, the voice of the Divinity announces his de|&s;ign of rewarding the pious and cha&s;te pa&s;|&s;ion of an earthly maiden, and de&s;cribes the holy tenderne&s;s and ardour with which &s;he panted for a cele&s;tial &s;pou&s;e. The ver&s;es that include this de&s;cription are re|markably &s;pirited and elegant, for the age in which they were compo&s;ed:&mdash;the maiden is repre&s;ented as thus venting the fond enthu|&s;ia&s;m of her &s;oul:

Having proclaimed the merits of this cha&s;te and &s;ervent devotee, the &s;acred voice de|clares, that &s;he &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;anctity &s;he de&s;ires; and her name is inrolled in the eternal regi&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nomen perpetuo &s;cribitur inde libro.</NOTE>. The poet proceeds to tell, how the newly-con&s;ecrated virgin is de|corated
<PB N="231" REF="233">
with all the jewels of heaven; he affirms, however, that the cha&s;te and humble virtues are her be&s;t ornaments: he magni|fies the excellence of virginity compared to the mi&s;eries of a married life; and he con|cludes with a prayer, addre&s;&s;ing the whole poem to the cha&s;te and pious Agnes, whom his royal mi&s;tre&s;s Radegunda had rai&s;ed to the dignity of abbe&s;s, in the religious hou&s;e which &s;he her&s;elf had founded. Perhaps it may be a groundle&s;s conjecture, but I am inclined to believe that Fortunatus com|po&s;ed this poem with infinite art, intending an oblique and concealed compliment to the problematical virginity of Radegunda her|&s;elf, though in the clo&s;e he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to Agnes as the virgin, who had thus made a kind of holiday in heaven. My conjec|ture ari&s;es from the following remarkable circum&s;tances:&mdash;In the long de&s;cription of this cele&s;tial ceremony, the name of this vir|gin, &s;o intere&s;ting to all the powers of hea|ven, is not once mentioned, although it is &s;aid to be in&s;cribed in the eternal volume.
<PB N="232" REF="234">
This &s;ingular omi&s;&s;ion per&s;uades me, that the poet wi&s;hed to compliment &s;ome lady as a virgin of uncommon &s;anctity, whom he did not think it prudent to name. His cold manner of addre&s;&s;ing the poem to Agnes, appears to me as a kind of ma&s;k to his real intention. Be&s;ides, there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, in his enthu&s;ia&s;tic de&s;cription of the cha&s;te female &s;o highly honoured by Heaven, which do not agree with the condition of Agnes, and may be applied with an elegant pro|priety to his royal mi&s;tre&s;s Radegunda. Af|ter de&s;cribing this anonymous virgin as de|corated with a long catalogue of cele&s;tial jewels, the poet exclaims:
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>His cumulata bonis thalamo regina &s;edebit,</L>
<L>Atque poli &s;obolem &s;ub pede virgo premet.</L></NOTE>Deck'd with the&s;e gems a heavenly queen &s;he'll reign,</L>
<L>And rule, a virgin, o'er the angelic train.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another poem of Fortuna|tus, expre&s;sly on the virtues of Radegunda,
<PB N="233" REF="235">
in which, after having compared her to the mo&s;t celebrated of the holy virgins, for charity and ab&s;tinence, for devotion and fortitude, he adds,
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Caetera nunc taceam melius, quia te&s;te Tonante,</L>
<L>Judicioque Dei, glorificata manent.</L></NOTE>To &s;peak thy farther merits I refrain,</L>
<L>Which from thy con&s;cious God full glory gain.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such are the grounds of my conjecture: whether Radegunda was in truth an Old Maid, and whether her ingenious &s;ecretary intended to pay her an oblique compli|ment for the peculiar delicacy with which &s;he has been &s;uppo&s;ed to acquire and &s;up|port that venerable character, are points which I mu&s;t now leave to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the curious. However great the cha&s;tity of this pious queen might be, it has not e&s;|caped detraction; and our poet him&s;elf has been &s;u&s;pected of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing too lively an intere&s;t in her heart. Some late biogra|phers of the fair royal &s;aint have con&s;i|dered
<PB N="234" REF="236">
this calumny as the immediate &s;ug|ge&s;tion of the devil, provoked by the pecu|liar purity of Radegunda; but it appears to have ari&s;en rather from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome early writers, who, finding in the po|ems of Fortunatus, that he had been accu&s;ed of being a little too fond of the abovemen|tioned Agnes, made a mi&s;take in their ac|count of this matter, and transferred his &s;uppo&s;ed affection from the abbe&s;s to the queen. The truth &s;eems to be, that Fortu|natus lived in a very plea&s;ing and innocent familiarity with the&s;e two pious ladies. They amu&s;ed them&s;elves in &s;ending little pre&s;ents of &s;weetmeats, and other mona&s;tic delicacies, to their ingenious friend. He acknowledged their favours with poetical gallantry. The extempore ver&s;es which he compo&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;ions are printed with his poems; they do honour to the ten|derne&s;s of his heart, and the elegance of his genius; but though they often breathe the warm &s;pirit of affection, they are far from throwing any &s;tain on the purity of his mo|rals.
<PB N="235" REF="237">
His royal mi&s;tre&s;s is &s;aid, by the authors of the Literary Hi&s;tory of France, to have ended her life in 587: our poet died in 609, and his fe&s;tival is yet celebrated at Poitiers, on the 14th of December.</P>
<P>The following pious herald of cha&s;tity in the dark ages was an illu&s;trious character of our own country. I mean the great Aldhelm, bi&s;hop of Shireburn in Dor&s;et|&s;hire, during the Saxon heptarchy. This canonized bard was not only di&s;tingui&s;hed by peculiar &s;anctity, but excelled in the &s;i&s;ter arts of poetry and mu&s;ic, and has been celebrated as the per&s;on who introduced Latin ver&s;e into England.</P>
<P>His poetical talents were great indeed, for the period in which he flouri&s;hed; and he exerted them in a compo&s;ition of heroic ver&s;e, extolling the mo&s;t eminent votaries of virginity, both male and female. In the latter catalogue the following are his he|roines&mdash;the Virgin Mary, and the Saints Caecilia, Agatha, Lucia, Ju&s;tina, Eugenia, Agnes, Thecla, Eulalia, Schola&s;tica, Con|&s;tantina,
<PB N="236" REF="238">
Eu&s;tochium, Demetrias, Ana&s;ta|&s;ia, Rufina Secunda, Anatolia, Victoria.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of Aldhelm's poetry, I &s;hall &s;elect his ver&s;es on Caecilia, who&s;e ta|lents have rendered her the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of female &s;aints.</P>

<P>The ingenious prelate continues to illu&s;|trate this angelical divi&s;ion of human me|rits by many more metaphors of equal force, and then tells us the preci&s;e meaning of the&s;e three &s;ignificant terms&mdash;a nece&s;&s;ary explanation, as, without it, a modern reader would be little able to under&s;tand the ano|nymous angel thus quoted by Aldhelm!

<P>Such was the doctrine of the famous Aldhelm, which throws a con&s;iderable light on the practices of the times in which he lived, when the great purpo&s;e of marriage was often defeated, as in the ca&s;e of King Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, by a vain preten&s;ion to &s;uperior &s;anctity. This poetical prelate was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate an admirer of pure virgi|nity, that he put his own continence to many &s;ingular and dangerous trials. It is related by his elegant and affectionate bio|grapher, William of Malm&s;bury, that Ald|helm did not, like other prie&s;ts, avoid the company of women, but often detained &s;ome virgin by his &s;ide, both &s;itting and lying, and, while he held her in his em|braces, repeated his whole p&s;alter, to the confu&s;ion of the devil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Vel a&s;&s;idens vel cubitans aliquam detinebat, quoad carnis tepe&s;cente lubrico, quieto et immoto di&s;cederet animo.

<P><PB N="245" REF="247">However this conduct might encrea&s;e the veneration which was paid to this ex|traordinary &s;aint, I cannot help condemn|ing it as an in&s;tance of cruelty and in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Great as his exultation and triumph might be, on thus deriding the devil, as his biographer expre&s;&s;es it, by a marvellous di&s;play of his own &s;ubdued de&s;ires, he had certainly no right to &s;port &s;o wantonly with the pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e religious Old Maids (for they could hardly be young ones) whom he thus made the unea&s;y in&s;truments of his own cha&s;te reputation.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the mo&s;t eminent poets, who amu&s;ed the dark ages by celebrating the wonderful virgins of that period, I ought not to omit the venerable Bede. He has enlivened his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory,
<PB N="246" REF="248">
by in&s;erting a poetical panegyric on the cha&s;te Aedilthryda, a lady who cho&s;e to fly from the bed and throne of her hu&s;band Ecfrid, king of Northumberland, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving her virginity in a cloi&s;ter. For this pious exploit &s;he is extolled in the highe&s;t terms by the holy bard; who, in &s;inging her prai&s;es, &s;eems to felicitate him|&s;elf, with a gallant complacency, that he is &s;uperior to Virgil in the happy choice of his &s;ubject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Bella Maro re&s;onet, nos pacis dona canamus:</L>

<P>Milton has not deigned to enter into a very whim&s;ical part of this lady's hi&s;tory; but a mona&s;tic hi&s;torian informs us, that her hu&s;band, repenting of the indulgence he had granted to her, and inflamed with new de&s;ire, determined to force her from her religious retreat, and to con&s;ummate his
<PB N="248" REF="250">
marriage: &s;he e&s;caped both from his love and his re&s;entment, by a &s;eries of the mo&s;t extraordinary miracles, which the curious reader may find very circum&s;tantially re|lated in the fir&s;t volume of Dugdale's Mo|na&s;ticon. After &s;u&s;taining great hard&s;hips, &s;he is &s;aid to have expired a perfect virgin, in the year 679; and the miracles di&s;played at her tomb were not inferior to tho&s;e by which her life was di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e the volume without la|menting the &s;ufferings of the fair &s;ex in the ages of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition. When all the &s;aints of the time mo&s;t zealou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, that it was meritorious in a married woman to remain a virgin, dome&s;tic life mu&s;t have been frequently embittered by tragi-comical contention; and, perhaps, the mind of many a well-meaning woman has been half di&s;|tracted by the &s;truggle, which &s;uch doctrine may have produced, between tenderne&s;s and devotion. It may, however, afford us &s;ome con&s;olation to reflect, that whenever the&s;e good ladies were mi&s;led by the prie&s;t|hood
<PB N="249" REF="251">
into a painful &s;acrifice of innocent de|light, their pride was ince&s;&s;antly gratified by the pious honours that were lavi&s;hed upon their rigid virginity: yet their pa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch honours was &s;ometimes repre&s;&s;ed by the &s;tronger feelings of per&s;onal vanity, as we may collect from a ludicrous miracle related by Gregory of Tours. That hi&s;|torian gives us a circum&s;tantial account of a noble and pious pair, who, being married in their youth, pa&s;&s;ed through life together with this extraordinary continence, at the particular reque&s;t of the lady. She hap|pened to die fir&s;t, and, as her good man at|tended her funeral, he exclaimed, while the body was &s;inking into the grave,
<Q>I thank thee, eternal God, that as I received this trea&s;ure from thee, &s;o I return it imma|culate to thy goodne&s;s.</Q>
