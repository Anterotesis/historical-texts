<P>THE AUCTION A POEM: A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, With the head of HARPOCRATES, the God of Silence among&s;t the Egyptians, in a Ring.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Poem con&s;i&s;ted originally of no more than about a hundred and fifty lines, and was &s;ent by the Author (with the head of HARPOCRATES, the God of Silence, in a ring) to a particular friend, who &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that if it were properly enlarged, it might not be unworthy the peru&s;al of the Public; in con|&s;equence of which he has accordingly enlarged it, and &s;ubmits it to their Candour and Indulgence.</P>
<P>If the Critic &s;hould accu&s;e him of ab&s;urdity, for giving language to the god of Silence, he an&s;wers, there may be times when the actions of men are &s;o palpably ab&s;urd, and &s;o totally
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
&s;ubver&s;ive of Liberty, that even the tongue of Silence may become eloquent in its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If this &s;ubterfuge is too flim&s;ey to pa&s;s, he flies to the <HI>poetica licentia,</HI> that exten&s;ive field of fiction, where the Poet is allowed to di&s;po&s;e of animation, per&s;onification, or elocution, in any manner his fancy directs, uncontrouled by the &s;hackles of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>That part of the Poem where Mr. HOLLAND is mentioned, was printed off before his death, otherwi&s;e the Author would in a different man|ner have given his opinion of the goodne&s;s of that valuable Actor's heart.</P>
