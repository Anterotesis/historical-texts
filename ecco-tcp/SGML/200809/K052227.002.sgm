<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON HOMER's Battels.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS it may be nece&s;&s;ary in this Place at the Opening of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Battels, to premi&s;e &s;ome Ob&s;er|vations upon them in general. I &s;hall fir&s;t endeavour to &s;hew the <HI>Conduct</HI> of the Poet herein, and next collect &s;ome <HI>Antiquities,</HI> that tend to a more di&s;tinct under|&s;tanding of tho&s;e De&s;criptions which make &s;o large a Part of the Poem.</P>
<P>One may very well apply to <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf what he &s;ays of his Heroes at the end of the fourth Book, that who&s;oever &s;hould be guided thro' their Battels by <HI>Minerva,</HI> and pointed to every Scene of them, would &s;ee nothing through the whole but Subjects of Surprize and Applau&s;e. When the Reader re|flects that no le&s;s than the Compa&s;s of twelve Books is taken up in the&s;e, he will have Rea&s;on to wonder by what Methods our Author could prevent De&s;criptions of &s;uch a length from being tedious. It is not enough to &s;ay, that tho' the Subject it&s;elf be the &s;ame, the Actions are always different; That we have now di&s;tinct Combates, now promi&s;cuous Fights, now &s;ingle Duels, now general Engagements: Or that the Scenes are perpetually vary'd; we are now in the Fields, now at the Fortification of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> now at the Ships, now at the Gates
<PB N="2" REF="3">
of <HI>Troy,</HI> now at the River <HI>Scamander:</HI> But we mu&s;t look far|ther into the Art of the Poet to find the Rea&s;ons of this a&s;to|ni&s;hing Variety.</P>
<P>We may fir&s;t ob&s;erve that <HI>Diver&s;ity</HI> in the <HI>Deaths</HI> of his <HI>Warriors,</HI> which he has &s;upply'd by the va&s;te&s;t Fertility of Invention that ever was. The&s;e he di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;everal ways: Sometimes by the <HI>Characters</HI> of the Men, their <HI>Age, Office, Profe&s;&s;ion, Nation, Family,</HI> &amp;c. One is a blooming <HI>Youth,</HI> who&s;e Father di&s;&s;uaded him from the War; one is a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> who&s;e Piety could not &s;ave him; one is a <HI>Sport&s;man</HI> whom <HI>Diana</HI> taught in vain; one is the <HI>Native</HI> of a far-di&s;tant <HI>Coun|try</HI> who is never to return; one is de&s;cended from a Noble <HI>Line</HI> which ends in his Death; one is made remarkable by his <HI>Boa&s;ting;</HI> another by his <HI>Be&s;eeching;</HI> and another who is di&s;tingui&s;h'd no way el&s;e is mark'd by his <HI>Habit</HI> and the Sin|gularity of his Armor.</P>
<P>Sometimes he varies the&s;e Deaths by the &s;everal <HI>Po&s;tures</HI> in which his Heroes are repre&s;ented either fighting or falling. Some of the&s;e are &s;o exceedingly <HI>exact,</HI> that one may gue&s;s from the very Po&s;ition of the Combatant, whereabouts the Wound will light: Others &s;o very <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>uncommon,</HI> that they could only be the Effect of an Imagination which had &s;earch'd thro' all the Ideas of Nature. Such is that Pi|cture of <HI>Mydon</HI> in the fifth Book, who&s;e Arm being numb'd by a blow on the Elbow, drops the Reins that trail on the Ground; and then being &s;uddenly &s;truck on the Temples falls headlong from the Chariot in a &s;oft and deep Place; where he &s;inks up to the Shoulders in the Sands, and continues a while fix'd by the Weight of his Armor, with his Legs quivering in the Air, 'till he is trampled down by his Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Another Cau&s;e of this Variety is the Difference of the <HI>Wounds</HI> that are given in the Ilaid: They are by no means like the Wounds de&s;cribed by mo&s;t other Poets, which are commonly made in the &s;elf-&s;ame obvious Places: The Heart and Head &s;erve for all tho&s;e in general who under|&s;tand no Anatomy, and &s;ometimes for Variety they kill Men by Wounds that are no where mortal but in their Poems. As the whole human Body is the Subject of the&s;e, &s;o no|thing is more nece&s;&s;ary to him who would de&s;cribe them
<PB N="3" REF="4">
well, than a thorough Knowledge of its Structure; even tho' the Poet is not profe&s;&s;edly to write of them as an Anatomi&s;t; in the &s;ame manner as an exact Skill in Anatomy is nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e Painters that would excel in drawing the Naked, tho' they are not to make every Mu&s;cle as vi&s;ible as in a Book of Chirurgery. It appears from &s;o many Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Homer</HI> that he was perfectly Ma&s;ter of this Science, that it would be need|le&s;s to cite any in particular. One may only ob&s;erve, that if we thoroughly examine all the Wounds he has de&s;cribed, tho' &s;o infinite in Number, and &s;o many ways diver&s;ify'd, we &s;hall hardly find one which will contradict this Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ju&s;t add a Remark, that the various Periphra&s;es and Circumlocutions by which <HI>Homer</HI> expre&s;&s;es the &s;ingle Act of <HI>Dying,</HI> have &s;upply'd <HI>Virgil</HI> and the &s;ucceeding Poets with all their manners of phra&s;ing it. Indeed he repeats the &s;ame Ver&s;e on that Occa&s;ion more often than they&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But tho' it mu&s;t be owned he had more frequent Occa&s;ions for a Line of this Kind than any Poet, as no other has de&s;crib'd half &s;o many Deaths, yet one cannot a&s;cribe this to any Sterility of Expre&s;|&s;ion, but to the Genius of his Times, that delighted in tho&s;e reiterated Ver&s;es. We find Repetitions of the &s;ame &s;ort affe|cted by the &s;acred Writers, &s;uch as <HI>He was gathered to his People; He &s;lept with his Fathers,</HI> and the like. And upon the whole they have a certain antiquated Harmony not unlike the Burthen of a Song, which the Ear is willing to &s;uffer, and as it were re&s;ts upon.</P>
<P>As the perpetual Horror of Combates, and a Succe&s;&s;ion of Images of Death, could not but keep the Imagination very much on the &s;tretch; <HI>Homer</HI> has been careful to contrive &s;uch Reliefs and Pau&s;es as might divert the Mind to &s;ome other Scene, without lo&s;ing Sight of his prin|cipal Object. His <HI>Compari&s;ons</HI> are the more frequent on this Account; for a <HI>Compari&s;on</HI> &s;erves this End the mo&s;t effectually of any thing, as it is at once corre&s;pondent to, and differing from the Subject. Tho&s;e Criticks who fancy that the U&s;e of Compari&s;ons di&s;tracts the Attention, and draws it from the fir&s;t Image which &s;hould mo&s;t employ it (as that we lo&s;e the Idea of the Battel it&s;elf, while we are led by a Si|mile
<PB N="4" REF="5">
to that of a Deluge or a Storm:) Tho&s;e, I &s;ay, may as well imagine we lo&s;e the Thought of the Sun, when we &s;ee his Reflection in the Water; where he appears more di&s;tinct|ly, and is contemplated more at ea&s;e than if we gaz'd direct|ly at his Beams. For 'tis with the Eye of the Imagination as with our corporeal Eye, it mu&s;t &s;ometimes be taken off from the Object in order to &s;ee in the better. The &s;ame Criticks that are di&s;plea&s;ed to have their Fancy di&s;tracted (as they call it) are yet &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves as to object to <HI>Ho|mer</HI> that his Similes are too much alike, and are too often derived from the &s;ame Animal. But is it not more rea&s;ona|ble (according to their own Notion) to compare the &s;ame Man always to the &s;ame Animal, than to &s;ee him &s;ometimes a Sun, &s;ometimes a Tree, and &s;ometimes a River? Tho' <HI>Ho|mer</HI> &s;peaks of the &s;ame Creature, he &s;o diver&s;ifies the Cir|cum&s;tances and Accidents of the Compari&s;ons, that they al|ways appear quite different. And to &s;ay Truth, it is not &s;o much the Animal or the Thing, as the Action or Po&s;ture of them, that employs our Imagination: Two different Animals in the &s;ame Action are more like to each other, than one and the &s;ame Animal is to him&s;elf, in two different Actions. And tho&s;e who in reading <HI>Homer</HI> are &s;hock'd that 'tis always a <HI>Lion,</HI> may as well be angry that 'tis always a <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>What may &s;eem more exceptionable is his in&s;erting the &s;ame Compari&s;ons in the &s;ame Words at length upon different Occa|&s;ions, by which Management he makes one &s;ingle Image afford many Ornaments to &s;everal Parts of the Poem. But may not one &s;ay <HI>Homer</HI> is in this like a skilful Improver, who pla|ces a beautiful Statue in a well-di&s;po&s;ed Garden &s;o as to an&s;wer &s;everal Vi&s;tas, and by that Artifice one &s;ingle Figure &s;eems multiply'd into as many Objects as there are Openings from whence it may be viewed?</P>
<P>What farther relieves and &s;oftens the&s;e De&s;criptions of Bat|tels, is the Poet's wonderful Art of introducing many pathetick Circum&s;tances about the Deaths of the Heroes, which rai&s;e a different Movement in the Mind from what tho&s;e Images na|turally in&s;pire, I mean Compa&s;&s;ion and Pity; when he cau&s;es us to look back upon the lo&s;t Riches, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and Hopes of tho&s;e who die: When he tran&s;ports us to their Native
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Countries and Paternal Seats, to &s;ee the Griefs of their aged Fathers, the De&s;pair and Tears of their Widows, or the aban|don'd Condition of their Orphans. Thus when <HI>Prote&s;ilaus</HI> falls, we are made to reflect on the lofty Palaces he left half fini&s;h'd; when the Sons of <HI>Phenops</HI> are killed, we behold the mortifying Di&s;tre&s;s of their wealthy Father, who &s;aw his E|&s;tate divided before his Eyes, and taken in Tru&s;t for Strangers. When <HI>Axylus</HI> dies, we are taught to compa&s;&s;ionate the hard Fate of that generous and ho&s;pitable Man, who&s;e Hou&s;e was the Hou&s;e of all Men, and who de&s;erv'd that glorious Elogy of, <HI>The Friend of Human-kind.</HI></P>
<P>It is worth taking Notice too, what U&s;e <HI>Homer</HI> every where makes of each little Accident or Circum&s;tance that can natu|rally happen in a Battel, thereby to ca&s;t a Variety over his Action; as well as of every Turn of Mind or Emotion a He|ro can po&s;&s;ibly feel, &s;uch as Re&s;entment, Revenge, Concern, Confu&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The former of the&s;e makes his Work re|&s;emble a large Hi&s;tory-Piece, where even the le&s;s important Figures and Actions have yet &s;ome convenient Place or Cor|ner to be &s;hewn in; and the latter gives it all the Advanta|ges of Tragedy in tho&s;e various Turns of Pa&s;&s;ion that animate the Speeches of his Heroes, and render his whole Poem the mo&s;t <HI>Dramatick</HI> of any Epick what&s;oever.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erv'd that the con&s;tant <HI>Machines</HI> of the <HI>Gods</HI> conduce very greatly to vary the&s;e long Battels, by a continual Change of the Scene from Earth to Heaven. <HI>Ho|mer</HI> perceiv'd them too nece&s;&s;ary for this Purpo&s;e to ab&s;tain from the U&s;e of them, even after <HI>Jupiter</HI> had enjoin'd the Deities not to Act on either &s;ide. It is remarkable how many Methods he has found to draw them into every Book; where if they dare not a&s;&s;i&s;t the Warriors, at lea&s;t they are very helpful to the Poet.</P>
<P>But there is nothing that more contributes to the Variety, Surprize, and <HI>Eclat</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Battels, or is more perfectly admirable in it&s;elf, than that artful Manner of taking Mea|&s;ure, or (as one may &s;ay) <HI>Gaging</HI> his Heroes by each other, and thereby elevating the Character of one Per&s;on by the Oppo&s;ition of it to that of &s;ome other whom he is made to excell. So that he many times de&s;cribes one only to image
<PB N="6" REF="7">
another, and rai&s;es one only to rai&s;e another. I cannot bet|ter exemplify this Remark, than by giving an In&s;tance in the Character of <HI>Diomed</HI> that lies before me. Let us ob&s;erve by what a Scale of Oppo&s;itions he elevates this Hero, in the fifth Book, fir&s;t to excell all human Valour, and after to rival the Gods them&s;elves. He di&s;tingui&s;hes him fir&s;t from the <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Captains in general, each of whom he repre&s;ents con|quering a &s;ingle <HI>Trojan,</HI> while <HI>Diomed</HI> con&s;tantly encounters two at once; and while they are engag'd each in his di&s;tinct Po&s;t, he only is drawn fighting in every quarter, and &s;laugh|tering on every &s;ide. Next he oppo&s;es him to <HI>Pandarus,</HI> next to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and then to <HI>Hector.</HI> So of the Gods he &s;hews him fir&s;t again&s;t <HI>Venus,</HI> then <HI>Apollo,</HI> then <HI>Mars,</HI> and la&s;tly in the eighth Book again&s;t <HI>Jupiter</HI> him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of his Thunders. The &s;ame Conduct is ob&s;ervable more or le&s;s in regard to every Per&s;onage of his Work.</P>
<P>This Subordination of the Heroes is one of the Cau&s;es that make each of his Battels ri&s;e above the other in Greatne&s;s, Terror, and Importance, to the end of the Poem. If <HI>Dio|med</HI> has perform'd all the&s;e Wonders in the fir&s;t Combates, it is but to rai&s;e <HI>Hector,</HI> at who&s;e Appearance he begins to fear. If in the next Battels <HI>Hector</HI> triumphs not only over <HI>Diomed,</HI> but over <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Patroclus,</HI> &s;ets fire to the Fleet, wins the Armor of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and &s;ingly eclip&s;es all the Heroes; in the mid&s;t of all this Glory, <HI>Achilles</HI> appears, <HI>Hector</HI> flies, and is &s;lain.</P>
<P>The Manner in which his Gods are made to act, no le&s;s advances the Gradation we are &s;peaking of. In the fir&s;t Bat|tels they are &s;een only in &s;hort and &s;eparate Excur&s;ions: <HI>Ve|nus</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ts <HI>Paris, Minerva Diomed,</HI> or <HI>Mars Hector.</HI> In the next a clear Stage is left for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> to di&s;play his Omnipo|tence and turn the Fate of Armies alone. In the la&s;t, all the Powers of Heaven are let down and banded into regular Parties, Gods encountring Gods, <HI>Jove</HI> encouraging them with his Thunders, <HI>Neptune</HI> rai&s;ing his Tempe&s;ts, Heaven flaming, Earth trembling, and <HI>Pluto</HI> him&s;elf &s;tarting from the Throne of Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
I AM now to take Notice of &s;ome Cu&s;toms of Antiquity, relating to the Arms and Art Military of tho&s;e Times, which are proper to be known in order to form a right Notion of our Author's De&s;criptions of War.</P>
<P>That <HI>Homer</HI> copied the Manners and Cu&s;toms of the Age he writ of, rather than of that he lived in, has been ob&s;er|ved in &s;ome In&s;tances. As that he no where repre&s;ents <HI>Ca|valry</HI> or <HI>Trumpets</HI> to have been u&s;ed in the <HI>Trojan</HI> Wars, tho' they apparently were in his own Time. It is not therefore im|po&s;&s;ible but there may be found in his Works &s;ome Deficiencies in the Art of War, which are not to be imputed to his Ig|norance, but to his Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Hor&s;es</HI> had not been brought into <HI>Greece</HI> long before the Siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> They were originally Ea&s;tern Animals, and if we find at that very Period &s;o great a Number of them reckon'd up in the Wars of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> it is the le&s;s a won|der con&s;idering they came from <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The Practice of riding them was &s;o little known in <HI>Greece</HI> a few Years before, that they look'd upon the <HI>Centaurs</HI> who fir&s;t u&s;ed it, as Mon&s;ters compounded of Men and Hor&s;es. <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> in the fir&s;t <HI>Iliad</HI> &s;ays he had &s;een the&s;e <HI>Centaurs</HI> in his Youth, and <HI>Polypaetes</HI> in the &s;econd is &s;aid to have been born on the Day that his Father expelled them from <HI>Pelion</HI> to the De&s;arts of <HI>Aethica.</HI> They had no other U&s;e of Hor&s;es than to draw their Chari|ots in Battel, &s;o that whenever <HI>Homer</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>fighting from an Hor&s;e, taming an Hor&s;e,</HI> or the like, it is con&s;tantly to be under&s;tood of fighting from a Chariot, or taming Hor&s;es to that Service. This (as we have &s;aid) was a piece of Deco|rum in the Poet; for in his own Time they were arrived to &s;uch a Perfection in Hor&s;eman&s;hip, that in the fifteenth <HI>Iliad</HI> &vers;. 680. we have a <HI>Simile</HI> taken from an extraordinary Feat of Activity, where one Man manages four Hor&s;es at once, and leaps from the Back of one to another at full Speed.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider in what high E&s;teem among Warriors the&s;e noble Animals mu&s;t have been at their fir&s;t coming into <HI>Greece,</HI> we &s;hall the le&s;s wonder at the frequent Occa&s;ions <HI>Homer</HI> has taken to de&s;cribe and celebrate them. It is not &s;o &s;trange to find them &s;et almo&s;t upon a level with Men, at
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the time when a <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> in the Prizes was of equal Value with a <HI>Captive.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chariots</HI> were in all Probability very low. For we fre|quently find in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> that a Per&s;on who &s;tands erect on a Chariot is killed (and &s;ometimes by a Stroke on the Head) by a Foot-Soldier with a Sword. This may farther appear from the Ea&s;e and Readine&s;s with which they alight or mount on every Occa&s;ion, to facilitate which, the Chariots were made open behind. That the Wheels were but &s;mall, may be gue&s;t from a Cu&s;tom they had of taking them off and &s;etting them on, as they were laid by, or made u&s;e of. <HI>Hebe</HI> in the fifth Book puts on the Wheels of <HI>Juno</HI>'s Chariot when &s;he calls for it in ha&s;te. And it &s;eems to be with Allu&s;ion to the &s;ame Practice that it is &s;aid in <HI>Exodus</HI> Ch. 14. <HI>The Lord took off their Chariot Wheels, &s;o that they drove them heavily.</HI> The Sides were al&s;o low; for whoever is killed in his Chariot throughout the Poem, con&s;tantly falls to the Ground as having nothing to &s;upport him. That the whole Machine was very &s;mall and light, is evident from a Pa&s;&s;age in the tenth <HI>Iliad,</HI> where <HI>Diomed</HI> having taken a Chariot, debates whether he &s;hall draw it out of the way, or carry it on his Shoulders to a Place of Safety. All the&s;e Particulars agree with the Repre&s;entations of the Chariots on the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Coins; where the Tops of them reach not &s;o high as the Backs of the Hor&s;es, the Wheels are yet lower, and the Heroes who &s;tand in them are &s;een from the Knee upwards. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Collection of <HI>Goltzius, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>This may &s;erve to &s;hew tho&s;e Criticks are under a Mi&s;take, who blame <HI>Homer</HI> for making his Warriors &s;ome|times retire behind their Chariots, as if it were a Piece of Cowardice: which was as little di&s;graceful then, as it is now to alight from one's Hor&s;e in a Battel on any nece&s;&s;ary Emergency.</P>
<P>There were generally two Per&s;ons in each Chariot, one of whom was wholly employ'd in guiding the Hor&s;es. They u&s;ed indifferently two, three, or four Hor&s;es: From hence it happens, that &s;ometimes when a Hor&s;e is killed, the Hero continues the Fight with the two or more that remain; and
<PB N="9" REF="10">
at other times a Warrior retreats upon the Lo&s;s of one; not that he has le&s;s Courage than the other, but that he has fewer Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Swords</HI> were all broad cutting Swords, for we find they never &s;tab but with their Spears. The <HI>Spears</HI> were u&s;ed two ways, either to pu&s;h with, or to ca&s;t from them, like the mi&s;&s;ive Javelins. It &s;eems &s;urprizing that a Man &s;hould throw a Dart or Spear with &s;uch Force as to pierce thro' both &s;ides of the Armor and the Body (as is often de&s;cribed in <HI>Homer.</HI>) For if the Strength of the Men was Gigantick, the Armor mu&s;t have been &s;trong in Proportion. Some Solution might be given for this, if we imagin'd the Armor was ge|nerally Bra&s;s, and the Weapons pointed with Iron; and if we could fancy that <HI>Homer</HI> call'd the Spears and Swords <HI>Brazen</HI> in the &s;ame manner that he calls the Reins of a Bridle <HI>Ivo|ry,</HI> only from the Ornaments about them. But there are Pa&s;&s;ages where the Point of the Spear is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be of Bra&s;s, as in the De&s;cription of that of <HI>Hector</HI> in <HI>Iliad</HI> 6. &vers;. 320. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> in <HI>Laconicis</HI> takes it for granted, that the Arms, as well offen&s;ive as defen&s;ive, were Bra&s;s. He &s;ays the Spear of <HI>Achilles</HI> was kept in his Time in the Temple of <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI> the Top and Point of which were of Bra&s;s; and the Sword of <HI>Meriones,</HI> in that of <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> among the <HI>Nicome|dians,</HI> was entirely of the &s;ame Metal. But be it as it will, there are Examples even at this Day of &s;uch a prodigious Force in ca&s;ting Darts, as almo&s;t exceeds Credibility. The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> will pierce thro' thick Planks with Darts of harden'd Wood; which can only be attributed to their being bred (as the Ancients were) to that Exerci&s;e, and to the Strength and Agility acquir'd by a con&s;tant Practice of it.</P>
<P>We may a&s;cribe to the &s;ame Cau&s;e their Power of ca&s;ting <HI>Stones</HI> of a va&s;t Weight, which appears a common Practice in the&s;e Battels. Tho&s;e are in a great Error, who imagine this to be only a fictitious Embelli&s;hment of the Poet, which was one of the Exerci&s;es of War among the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Orientals.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mos e&s;t in Urbibus Pale&s;tinae, &amp; u&s;que hodie per omnem Judaeam vetus con&s;uetudo &s;er|vatur, ut in viculis, oppidis, &amp; ca&s;tellis rotundi ponantur lapides gravi&s;&s;imi ponderis, ad quos juvenes exercere &s;e &s;olent, &amp; eos pro varietate virium &s;ublevare, alii ad genua, alii ad umbilicum, alii ad humeros, ad caput, non nulli &s;uper verticem, rectis juncti&s;que manibus, magnitudinem virium demon&s;trantes, pondus attollunt.</NOTE>St. <HI>Jerome</HI> tells us, it was an old Cu&s;tom in
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> and in U&s;e in his own Time, to have round Stones of a great Weight kept in the Ca&s;tles and Villages for the Youth to try their Strength with. And the Cu&s;tom is yet ex|tant in &s;ome Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where Stones for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e are laid at the Gates of great Hou&s;es, which they call <HI>Putting-Stones.</HI></P>
<P>Another Con&s;ideration which will account for many things that may &s;eem uncouth in <HI>Homer,</HI> is the Reflection that be|fore the U&s;e of <HI>Fire-Arms</HI> there was infinitely more Scope for per&s;onal Valor than in the modern Battels. Now when&s;oe|ver the per&s;onal Strength of the Combatants happen'd to be unequal, the declining a &s;ingle Combate could not be &s;o di&s;|honourable as it is in this Age, when the Arms we make u&s;e of put all Men on a level. For a Soldier of far inferior Strength may manage a Rapier or Fire-Arms &s;o expertly as to be an Overmatch to his Adver&s;ary. This may appear a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e for what in the modern Con&s;truction might &s;eem Cow|ardice in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Heroes, when they avoid engaging with o|thers who&s;e bodily Strength exceeds their own. The Maxims of Valor in all Times were founded upon Rea&s;on, and the Cowardice ought rather in this Ca&s;e to be imputed to him who braves his Inferior. There was al&s;o more <HI>Lei&s;ure</HI> in their Battels before the Knowledge of Fire-Arms; and this in a good Degree accounts for tho&s;e Harangues his Heroes make to each other in the Time of Combate.</P>
<P>There was another Practice frequently u&s;ed by the&s;e ancient Warriors, which was to &s;poil an Enemy of his Arms after they had &s;lain him; and this Cu&s;tom we &s;ee them frequently pur&s;uing with &s;uch Eagerne&s;s as if they look'd on their Victory not complete 'till this Point was gain'd. Some modern Criticks have accu&s;ed them of Avarice on ac|count of this Practice, which might probably ari&s;e from the great Value and Scarcene&s;s of Armor in that early Time and Infancy of War. It afterwards became a Point of Honour like gaining a Standard from the Enemy. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>David</HI> &s;peak of the Plea&s;ure of obtaining many Spoils. They pre&s;erv'd them as Monuments of Victory, and even Religion at la&s;t be|came intere&s;ted herein, when tho&s;e Spoils were con&s;ecrated in the Temples of the Tutelar Deities of the Conqueror.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
The Reader may ea&s;ily &s;ee I &s;et down the&s;e Heads ju&s;t as they occur to my Memory, and only as Hints to farther Ob&s;erva|tions; which any one who is conver&s;ant in <HI>Homer</HI> can not fail to make, if he will but think a little in the &s;ame Track.</P>
<P>It is no Part of my De&s;ign to enquire what Progre&s;s had been made in the Art of War at this early Period: The bare Peru&s;al of the Iliad will be&s;t inform us of it. But what I think tends more immediately to the better Comprehen&s;ion of the&s;e De&s;criptions, is to give a &s;hort View of the Scene of War, the Situation of <HI>Troy,</HI> and tho&s;e Places which <HI>Homer</HI> mentions, with the proper Field of each Battel: Putting to|gether for this Purpo&s;e tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in my Author that give any Light to this Matter.</P>
<P>The ancient City of <HI>Troy</HI> &s;tood at a greater Di&s;tance from the Sea than tho&s;e Ruins which have &s;ince been &s;hewn for it. This may be gather'd from Iliad 5. &vers;. (of the Original) 791. where it is &s;aid that the <HI>Trojans</HI> never dur&s;t &s;ally out of the <HI>Walls</HI> of their Town 'till the Retirement of <HI>Achilles,</HI> but af|terwards combated the <HI>Grecians</HI> at their very Ships, <HI>far from the City.</HI> For had <HI>Troy</HI> &s;tood (as <HI>Strabo</HI> ob&s;erves) &s;o nigh the <HI>Sea-&s;hore,</HI> it had been Madne&s;s in the <HI>Greeks</HI> not to have built any Fortification before their Fleet till the tenth Year of the Siege, when the Enemy was &s;o near them: And on the o|ther hand, it had been Cowardice in the <HI>Trojans</HI> not to have attempted any thing all that time, again&s;t an Army that lay unfortify'd and unintrench'd. Be&s;ides the intermediate Space had been too &s;mall to afford a Field for &s;o many various Ad|ventures and Actions of War. The Places about <HI>Troy</HI> parti|cularly mentioned by <HI>Homer</HI> lie in this Order.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Scaean Gate:</HI> This open'd to the Field of Battel, and was that thro' which the <HI>Trojans</HI> made their Excur&s;ions. Clo&s;e to this &s;tood the <HI>Beech-Tree</HI> &s;acred to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> generally mentions with it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Hill</HI> of <HI>wild Fig-trees.</HI> It join'd to the Walls of <HI>Troy</HI> on one &s;ide, and extended to the High-way on the o|ther. The fir&s;t appears from what <HI>Andromache</HI> &s;ays in Iliad 6. &vers;. 432. that <HI>the Walls were in danger of being &s;caled from this Hill;</HI> and the la&s;t from Il. 22. &vers;. 145. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="12" REF="13">
3. The <HI>two Springs</HI> of <HI>Scamander.</HI> The&s;e were a little higher on the &s;ame High-way. (<HI>Ibid.</HI>)</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Callicolone,</HI> the Name of a plea&s;ant Hill, that lay near the River <HI>Simois,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the Town. <HI>Il.</HI> 20. &vers;. 53.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Bateia,</HI> or the Sepulchre of <HI>Myrinne,</HI> &s;tood a little be|fore the City in the Plain. <HI>Il.</HI> 2. &vers;. 318. <HI>of the Catal.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The <HI>Monument</HI> of <HI>Ilus:</HI> Near the middle of the Plain. <HI>Il.</HI> 11. &vers;. 166.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The Tomb of <HI>Ae&s;yetes,</HI> commanded the Pro&s;pect of the Fleet, and that Part of the Sea-coa&s;t. <HI>Il.</HI> 2. &vers;. 301. <HI>of the Catalogue.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>IT &s;eems, by the 465<HI>th</HI> Ver&s;e of the &s;econd Iliad, that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army was drawn up under the &s;everal Leaders by the Banks of <HI>Scamander</HI> on that &s;ide toward the Ships: In the mean time that of <HI>Troy</HI> and the Auxiliaries was rang'd in Order at <HI>Myrinne</HI>'s Sepulchre. <HI>Ibid.</HI> &vers;. 320 <HI>of the Catal.</HI> The Place of the <HI>Fir&s;t Battel</HI> where <HI>Diomed</HI> performs his Exploits, was near the joining of <HI>Simois</HI> and <HI>Scamander;</HI> for <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Pallas</HI> coming to him, alight at the Confluence of tho&s;e Ri|vers. <HI>Il.</HI> 5. &vers;. 776. and that the <HI>Greeks</HI> had not yet pa&s;t the Stream, but fought on that &s;ide next the Fleet, appears from &vers;. 791 of the &s;ame Book, where <HI>Juno</HI> &s;ays <HI>the</HI> Trojans <HI>now brave them at their very Ships.</HI> But in the beginning of the &s;ixth Book, the Place of Battel is &s;pecify'd to be between the Rivers of <HI>Simois</HI> and <HI>Scamander;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Greeks</HI> (tho' <HI>Homer</HI> does not particularize when, or in what manner) had then cro&s;s'd the Stream toward <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>The Engagement in the eighth Book is evidently clo&s;e to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Fortification on the Shore. That Night <HI>Hector</HI> lay at <HI>Ilus</HI>'s Tomb in the Field, as <HI>Dolon</HI> tells us <HI>Lib.</HI> 10. &vers;. 415. And in the eleventh Book the Battel is chiefly about <HI>Ilus</HI>'s Tomb.</P>
<P>In the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, about the Fortifi|cation of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and in the fifteenth at the <HI>Ships.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ixteenth, the <HI>Trojans</HI> being repul&s;ed by <HI>Patroclus,</HI> they engage between the Fleet, the River, and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wall: See &vers;. 396. <HI>Patroclus</HI> &s;till advancing they fight at the Gates of <HI>Troy</HI> &vers;. 700. In the &s;eventeenth the Fight about the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
Body of <HI>Patroclus</HI> is under the <HI>Trojan</HI> Wall &vers;. 403. His Body being carried off, <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> pur&s;ue the <HI>Greeks</HI> to the Fortification &vers;. 760. And in the eighteenth, upon <HI>Achilles</HI>'s appearing, they retire and encamp without the Fortification.</P>
<P>In the twentieth, the Fight is &s;till on that &s;ide next the Sea; for the <HI>Trojans</HI> being pur&s;ued by <HI>Achilles,</HI> pa&s;s over the <HI>Scamander</HI> as they run toward <HI>Troy:</HI> See the beginning of Book 21. The following Battels are either in the River it&s;elf, or between that and the City, under who&s;e Walls <HI>Hector</HI> is kill'd in the twenty &s;econd Book, which puts an end to the Battels of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>

This Conduct pre&s;erves the Unity of the Piece, and keeps the Imagination from being di&s;tra|cted and confu&s;ed with a wild Number of independent Figures, which have no Subordination to each other.

&s;ooner retired, but <HI>Homer</HI> rai&s;es his other <HI>Greeks</HI> to &s;upply his Ab&s;ence; like Stars that &s;hine each in his due Revolution, till the principal Hero ri&s;es again, and eclip&s;es all others. As <HI>Diomed</HI> is the fir&s;t in this Office, he &s;eems to have more of the Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> than any be&s;ides. He has naturally an Exce&s;s of Boldne&s;s and too much Fury in his Temper, for|ward and intrepid like the other, and running after Gods or Men promi&s;cuou&s;ly as they offer them&s;elves. But what differences his Character is, that he is &s;oon reclaim'd by Advice, hears tho&s;e that are more experienced, and in a word, obeys <HI>Minerva</HI> in all things. He is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Patrone&s;s of Wi&s;dom and Arms, as he is eminent both for Prudence and Valor. That which characterizes his Prudence is a quick Sagacity and Pre&s;ence of Mind in all Emergencies, and an undi&s;turb'd Readine&s;s in the very Article of Danger. And what is particular in his Valor is agreeable to the&s;e Qualities; his Actions being al|ways performed with remarkable Dexterity, Activity, and Di&s;patch. As the gentle and manageable Turn of his Mind &s;eems drawn with an Oppo&s;ition to the boi&s;terous Temper of <HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;o his bodily Excellencies &s;eem de&s;ign'd as in Con|tra&s;te to tho&s;e of <HI>Ajax,</HI> who appears with great Strength, but heavy and unwieldy. As he is forward to act in the Field, &s;o is he ready to &s;peak in the Council: But 'tis ob&s;ervable that his Coun&s;els &s;till incline to War, and are bya&s;s'd rather on the &s;ide of Bravery than Caution. Thus he advi&s;es to reject the Propo&s;als of the <HI>Trojans</HI> in the &s;eventh Book, and not to accept of <HI>Helen</HI> her &s;elf, tho' <HI>Paris</HI> &s;hould offer her. In the ninth, he oppo&s;es <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Propo&s;ition to return to <HI>Greece,</HI> in &s;o &s;trong a manner, as to declare he will &s;tay and continue the Siege him&s;elf, if the General &s;hould de|part. And thus he hears without Concern <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Re|fu&s;al of a Reconciliation, and doubts not to be able to carry on the War without him. As for his private Character, he appears a gallant Lover of Ho&s;pitality in his Behaviour to <HI>Glaucus</HI> in the &s;ixth Book; a Lover of Wi&s;dom in his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> in the eighth, and his Choice of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to ac|company him in the tenth; upon the whole, an open &s;in|cere Friend, and a generous Enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72">
The wonderful Actions he performs in this Battel, &s;eem to be the Effect of a noble Re&s;entment at the Reproach he had receiv'd from <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in the foregoing Book, to which the&s;e Deeds are the An&s;wer. He becomes immediately the &s;econd Hero of <HI>Greece,</HI> and dreaded equally with <HI>Achilles</HI> by the <HI>Trojans.</HI> At the fir&s;t Sight of him his Enemies make a Que&s;tion, Whether he is a Man or a God? <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Pandarus</HI> go again&s;t him, who&s;e Approach terrifies <HI>Sthenelus,</HI> and the Apprehen&s;ion of &s;o great a Warrior marvellou&s;ly exalts the Intrepidity of <HI>Diomed. Aeneas</HI> him&s;elf is not &s;av'd but by the interpo&s;ing of a Deity: He pur&s;ues and wounds that Deity, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> again e&s;capes only by the Help of a &s;tronger Power, <HI>Apollo.</HI> He attempts <HI>Apollo</HI> too, retreats not till the God threatens him in his own Voice, and even then retreats but a few Steps. When he &s;ees <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> him&s;elf in open Arms again&s;t him, he had not retir'd tho' he was wounded, but in Obedience to <HI>Minerva,</HI> and then retires with his Face toward them. But as &s;oon as &s;he permits him to engage with that God, he conquers, and &s;ends him groaning to Heaven. What Invention and what Conduct appears in this whole Epi&s;ode? What Boldne&s;s in rai&s;ing a Character to &s;uch a Pitch, and what Judgment in rai&s;ing it by &s;uch De|grees? While the mo&s;t daring Flights of Poetry are employ'd to move our Admiration, and at the &s;ame time the ju&s;te&s;t and clo&s;e&s;t Allegory, to reconcile tho&s;e Flights to moral Truth and Probability? It may be farther remark'd, that the high Degree to which <HI>Homer</HI> elevates this Character, en|ters into the principal De&s;ign of his whole Poem; which is to &s;hew, that the greate&s;t Per&s;onal Qualities and Forces are of no Effect when Union is wanting among the chief Rulers, and that nothing can avail till they are reconciled &s;o as to act in Concert.</P>

his Armor? <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> an&s;wers, that there are &s;everal Exam|ples in Hi&s;tory, of Fires being &s;een to break forth from hu|man Bodies as Pre&s;ages of Greatne&s;s and Glory. Among the re&s;t, <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the Life of <HI>Alexander</HI> de&s;cribes his Helmet much in this manner. This is enough to warrant the Ficti|on, and were there no &s;uch Example, the &s;ame Author &s;ays very well that the Imagination of a Poet is not to be confi|ned to &s;trict Phy&s;ical Truths. But all Objections may ea&s;ily be removed, if we con&s;ider it as done by <HI>Minerva,</HI> who had determined this Day to rai&s;e <HI>Diomed</HI> above all the Heroes, and cau&s;ed this Apparition to render him formidable. The Power of a God makes it not only allowable but highly no|ble, and greatly imagined by <HI>Homer;</HI> as well as corre&s;pon|dent to a Miracle in holy Scripture, where <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is de&s;cribed with a Glory &s;hining on his Face at his De&s;cent from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> a Parallel which <HI>Spondanus</HI> has taken notice of.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> was too &s;en&s;ible of the Beauty of this Pa&s;&s;age not to imitate it, and it mu&s;t be owned he has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his Original.<Q><L>Ardet apex capiti, cri&s;ti&s;que ac vertice flamma</L>

And methinks the Ob|jection of <HI>Macrobius</HI> to this Place is not ju&s;t, who thinks the Simile un&s;ea&s;onably apply'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> becau&s;e he was yet on his Ship, and had not begun the Battel. One may an&s;wer, that this miraculous Appearance could never be

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 27. Idaeus <HI>fled, Left the rich Chariot.</HI>]</Q> It is finely &s;aid by M. <HI>Dacier,</HI> that <HI>Homer</HI> appears perhaps greater by the Critici&s;ms that have been pa&s;t upon him, than by the Prai&s;es which have been given him. <HI>Zoilus</HI> had a Cavil at this Place; he thought it ridiculous in <HI>Idaeus</HI> to de&s;cend from his Chariot to fly, which he might have done fa&s;ter by the help of his Hor&s;es. Three things are &s;aid in an&s;wer to this; fir&s;t, that <HI>Idaeus</HI> knowing the Pa&s;&s;ion which <HI>Diomed</HI> had for Hor&s;es, might hope the Plea&s;ure of &s;eizing the&s;e would re|tard him from pur&s;uing him. Next, that <HI>Homer</HI> might de|&s;ign to repre&s;ent in this Action of <HI>Idaeus</HI> the common Effect of Fear, which di&s;turbs the Under&s;tanding to &s;uch a degree, as to make Men abandon the &s;ure&s;t means to &s;ave them&s;elves. And then, that <HI>Idaeus</HI> might have &s;ome Advantage of <HI>Diomed</HI> in Swiftne&s;s, which he had rea&s;on to confide in. But I fancy one may add another Solution which will better account for this Pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Homer</HI>'s word is <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which I believe would be better tran&s;lated <HI>non per&s;everavit,</HI> than <HI>non &s;u&s;tinuit defen|dere fratrem interfectum:</HI> and then the Sen&s;e will be clear, that <HI>Idaeus</HI> made an Effort to &s;ave his Brother's Body, which proving impracticable, he was obliged to fly with the utmo&s;t Precipitation. One may add, that his alighting from his Chariot was not that he could run fa&s;ter on foot, but that he could &s;ooner e&s;cape by mixing with the Crowd of com|mon Soldiers. There is a Particular exactly of the &s;ame Na|ture in the Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> Ch. 4. &vers;. 15. where <HI>Si&s;era</HI> a|lights to fly in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<P>It is ob&s;ervable thro' the whole Ilaid, that he endeavours every where to repre&s;ent the <HI>Greeks</HI> as &s;uperior to the <HI>Tro|jans</HI> in Valor and the Art of War. In the beginning of the third Book he de&s;cribes the <HI>Trojans</HI> ru&s;hing on to the Battel in a barbarous and confus'd manner, with loud Shouts and Cries, while the <HI>Greeks</HI> advance in the mo&s;t profound Silence and exact Order. And in the latter Part of the fourth Book, where the two Armies march to the Engagement, the <HI>Greeks</HI> are animated by <HI>Pallas,</HI> while <HI>Mars</HI> in&s;tigates the <HI>Tro|jans,</HI> the Poet attributing by this plain Allegory to the for|mer a well-conducted Valor, to the latter ra&s;h Strength and brutal Force: So that the Abilities of each Nation are di|&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Characters of the Deities who a&s;&s;i&s;t them.

But in this Place, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves, the Poet being wil|ling to &s;hew how much the <HI>Greeks</HI> excell'd their Enemies when they engag'd only with their proper Force, and when each &s;ide was alike de&s;titute of divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, takes occa|&s;ion to remove the Gods out of the Battel, and then each <HI>Grecian</HI> Chief gives &s;ignal In&s;tances of Valor &s;uperior to the <HI>Trojans.</HI></P>
<P>A modern Critick ob&s;erves that this con&s;tant Superiority of the <HI>Greeks</HI> in the Art of War, Valor, and Number, is contradictory to the main De&s;ign of the Poem, which is to make the Return of <HI>Achilles</HI> appear nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;er|vation of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> but this Contradiction vani&s;hes when we reflect that the Affront given <HI>Achilles</HI> was the occa&s;ion of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s interpo&s;ing in favour of the <HI>Trojans.</HI> Wherefore the Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> was not pernicious to the <HI>Greeks</HI> purely becau&s;e it kept him inactive, but becau&s;e it occa&s;ion'd <HI>Jupiter</HI> to afflict them in &s;uch a manner, as made it nece&s;&s;ary to appea&s;e <HI>Achilles</HI> in order to render <HI>Jupiter</HI> propitious.</P>

Upon the whole, however that Matter &s;tood, <HI>Homer</HI> was very favourable to Ba&s;tards, and has paid them more Complements than one in his Works. If I am not mi&s;taken <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> reckons him&s;elf one in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;eis.

He often borrowed his Si|miles from low Life, and provided they illu&s;trated his Thoughts in a ju&s;t and lively manner, it was all he had regard to.</P>
<P>THE Allegory of this whole Book lies &s;o open, is carry'd on with &s;uch Clo&s;ene&s;s, and wound up with &s;o much Fulne&s;s and Strength, that it is a wonder how it could enter into the Imagination of any Critick, that the&s;e Actions of <HI>Diomed</HI> were only a daring and extravagant Fiction in <HI>Homer,</HI> as if he af|fected the <HI>Marvellous</HI> at any rate.

Nothing is more ob&s;ervable than the particular Care <HI>Homer</HI> has taken to &s;hew
<PB N="114" REF="113">
he de&s;igned this Moral. He never omits any Occa&s;ion throughout the Book, to put it in expre&s;s Terms into the Mouths of the Gods or Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Weight. <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI> at the beginning of the Battel, is made to give this Precept to <HI>Diomed; Fight not again&s;t the Gods, but give way to them, and re&s;i&s;t only</HI> Venus. The &s;ame Godde&s;s opens his Eyes, and enlightens him &s;o far as to perceive when it is Heaven that acts immediately again&s;t him, or when it is Man only that oppo&s;es him.

That this <HI>Gallias</HI> entertain'd and cloathed at one time no le&s;s than five hundred Hor&s;e|men; and that there were in his Cellars three hundred Ve&s;|&s;els, each of which contain'd an hundred Hog&s;heads of Wine.

Nothing adds more Courage to the Minds of Men than Su|per&s;tition, and perhaps it was the only Expedient then left; much like a modern Practice in the Army, to enjoin a <HI>Fa&s;t</HI> when they wanted Provi&s;ion. <HI>Helenus</HI> could no way have made his Promi&s;e more credible, than by &s;ending a|way <HI>Hector;</HI> which look'd like an A&s;&s;urance that nothing could prejudice them during his Ab&s;ence on &s;uch a religious Account.

Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier</HI>'s An&s;wer in Defence of <HI>Homer</HI> is &s;o full, that I cannot do better than to tran&s;late it from his Remarks on the 26<HI>th</HI> Chapter of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Poetic.</HI> There can be nothing more unju&s;t than the Critici&s;ms pa&s;t upon things that are the Effect of Cu&s;tom. It was u&s;ual in ancient Times for Soldiers to talk together be|fore they encounter'd. <HI>Homer</HI> is full of Examples of this &s;ort, and he very well de&s;erves we &s;hould be &s;o ju&s;t as to believe, he had never done it &s;o often, but that it was agreeable to the Manners of his Age. But this is not only a thing of Cu&s;tom, but founded in Rea&s;on it&s;elf. The Ties of Ho&s;pitality in tho&s;e Times were held more &s;acred than tho&s;e of Blood; and it is on that Account <HI>Diomed</HI> gives &s;o long an Audience to <HI>Glaucus,</HI> whom he acknowledges to be his Gue&s;t, with whom it was not lawful to engage in Com|bate. <HI>Homer</HI> makes an admirable U&s;e of this Conjuncture, to introduce an entertaining Hi&s;tory after &s;o many Battels as he has been de&s;cribing, and to unbend the Mind of his Rea|der by a Recital of &s;o much Variety as the Story of the Family of <HI>Si&s;yphus.</HI> It may be farther ob&s;erv'd, with what
<PB N="159" REF="159">
Addre&s;s and Management he places this long Conver&s;ation; it is not during the Heat of an ob&s;tinate Battel, which had been too un&s;ea&s;onable to be excu&s;ed by any Cu&s;tom what|ever; but he brings it in after he has made <HI>Hector</HI> re|tire into <HI>Troy,</HI> when the Ab&s;ence of &s;o powerful an Enemy had given <HI>Diomed</HI> that Lei&s;ure which he could not have had otherwi&s;e. One need only read the judicious Remark of <HI>Eu|&s;tathius</HI> upon this Place. <HI>The Poet</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>after having caus'd</HI> Hector <HI>to go out of the Fight, interrupts the Violence of Wars, and gives &s;ome Relaxation to the Reader, in cau&s;ing him to pa&s;s from the Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order of the Action to the Tranquillity and Security of an Hi&s;torical Narration. For by means of the happy Epi&s;ode of</HI> Glaucus, <HI>he ca&s;ts a thou&s;and plea&s;ing Wonders into his Poem; as Fables, that include beau|tiful Allegories, Hi&s;tories, Genealogies, Sentences, ancient Cu|&s;toms, and &s;everal other Graces that tend to the diver&s;ifying of his Work, and which by breaking (as one may &s;ay) the Mono|tomy of it, agreeably in&s;truct the Reader.</HI> Let us ob&s;erve, in how fine a manner <HI>Homer</HI> has hereby prai&s;ed both <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Hector.</HI> For he makes us know, that as long as <HI>Hector</HI> is in the Field, the <HI>Greeks</HI> have not the lea&s;t Lei&s;ure to take breath; and that as &s;oon as he quits it, all the <HI>Trojans,</HI> how|ever they had regain'd all their Advantages, were not able to employ <HI>Diomed</HI> &s;o far as to prevent his entertaining him|&s;elf with <HI>Glaucus</HI> without any danger to his Party. Some may think after all, that tho' we may ju&s;tify <HI>Homer,</HI> we cannot excu&s;e the Manners of his Time; it not being natu|ral for Men with Swords in their Hands to dialogue together in cold Blood ju&s;t before they engage. But not to alledge, that the&s;e very Manners yet remain in tho&s;e Countries, which have not been corrupted by the Commerce of other Nati|ons, (which is a great Sign of their being natural) what Rea|&s;on can be offer'd that it is more natural to fall on at fir&s;t Sight with Rage and Fiercene&s;s, than to &s;peak to an E|nemy before the Encounter? Thus far Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier,</HI> and St. <HI>Evremont</HI> asks humourou&s;ly, if it might not be as pro|per in that Country for Men to harangue before they fought, as it is in <HI>England</HI> to make Speeches before they are hanged.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160">
That <HI>Homer</HI> is not in general apt to make un&s;ea&s;onable Harangues (as the&s;e Cen&s;urers would repre&s;ent) may appear from that remarkable Care he has &s;hewn in many Places to avoid them: As when in the fifth Book <HI>Aeneas</HI> being cured on a &s;udden in the middle of the Fight, is &s;een with Sur|prize by his Soldiers; he &s;pecifies with particular Caution, that they <HI>asked him no Que&s;tions how he became cured,</HI> in a time of &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s and Action. Again, when there is a Nece&s;&s;ity in the &s;ame Book that <HI>Minerva</HI> &s;hould have a Con|ference with <HI>Diomed,</HI> in order to engage him again&s;t <HI>Mars</HI> (after her Prohibition to him to fight with the Gods) <HI>Homer</HI> chu&s;es a time for that Speech, ju&s;t when the Hero is retir'd behind his Chariot to take Breath, which was the only Mo|ment that could be &s;pared during the Hurry of that whole Engagement. One might produce many In&s;tances of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Glaucus</HI> to <HI>Diomed</HI> is &s;everely cen&s;ured, not only on Account of the Circum&s;tance of Time and Place, but likewi&s;e on the Score of the Subject, which is taxed as improper, and foreign to the End and De&s;ign of the Poem. But the Criticks who have made this Objection, &s;eem neither to comprehend the De&s;ign of the Poet in general, nor the particular Aim of this Di&s;cour&s;e. Many Pa&s;&s;ages in the be&s;t ancient Poets appear unaffecting at pre&s;ent, which probably gave the greate&s;t Delight to their fir&s;t Readers, becau&s;e they were nearly intere&s;ted in what was there related. It is very plain that <HI>Homer</HI> de&s;igned this Poem as a Monument to the Honour of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who, tho' con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal inde|pendent Societies, were yet very national in Point of Glory, being &s;trongly affected with every thing that &s;eem'd to ad|vance the Honour of their common Country, and re&s;entful of any Indignity offer'd to it. This Di&s;po&s;ition was the Ground of that grand Alliance which is the Subject of this Poem. To Men &s;o fond of their Country's Glory, what could be more agreeable than to read a Hi&s;tory fill'd with Wonders of a noble Family tran&s;planted from <HI>Greece</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia?</HI> They might here learn with Plea&s;ure that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Virtues did not degenerate by removing into di&s;tant Climes: but e&s;pecial|ly they mu&s;t be affected with uncommon Delight to find that

<P>THE Battel renewing with double Ardour upon the Re|turn of <HI>Hector, Minerva</HI> is under Apprehen&s;ions for the <HI>Greeks.

Nine of the Princes accepting the Challenge, the Lot is ca&s;t, and falls upon <HI>Ajax.</HI> The&s;e Heroes, after &s;everal Attacks, are parted by the Night. The <HI>Trojans</HI> calling a Council, <HI>Antenor</HI> propo&s;es the Delivery of <HI>Helen</HI> to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> to which <HI>Paris</HI> will not con&s;ent, but of|fers to re&s;tore them her Riches. <HI>Priam</HI> &s;ends a Herald to make this Offer, and to demand a Truce for burning the Dead, the la&s;t of which only is agreed to by <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> When the Fu|nerals are performed, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> pur&s;uant to the Advice of <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> erect a Fortification to protect their Fleet and Camp, flank'd with Towers, and defended by a Ditch and Pali&s;ades. <HI>Neptune</HI> te&s;tifies his Jealou&s;y at this Work, but is pacified by a Promi&s;e from <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Both Armies pa&s;s the Night in Fea&s;t|ing, but <HI>Jupiter</HI> di&s;heartens the <HI>Trojans</HI> with Thunder and other Signs of his Wrath.</P>
<P>The three and twentieth Day ends with the Duel of <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Ajax:</HI> The next Day the Truce is agreed: Another is taken up in the Funeral Rites of the Slain; and one more in building the Fortification before the Ships: So that &s;omewhat above three Days is employed in this Book.

To this <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> an&s;wers, that the la&s;t Book was the only one in which both Armies were de&s;titute of the Aid of the Gods: In Con&s;equence of which there is no gallant Action atchiev'd, nothing extraordinary done, e|&s;pecially after the Retreat of <HI>Hector;</HI> but here the Gods are again introduced to u&s;her in a new Scene of great Actions.

Some have been of Opinion that the U&s;age of Burning the Dead was originally to prevent any Outrage to the Bodies from their Enemies; which Imagination is render'd not improba|ble by that Pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> where the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> burn the Bodies of <HI>Saul</HI> and his Sons after they had been mi&s;u&s;ed by the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> even tho' their common Cu|&s;tom was to bury their Dead. And &s;o <HI>Sylla</HI> among the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> was the fir&s;t of his Family who order'd his Body to be burnt, for fear the Barbarities he had exerci&s;ed on that of <HI>Ma|rius</HI> might be retaliated upon his own.

<P><HI>HOMER,</HI> like mo&s;t of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> is thought to have travell'd into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and brought from the Prie&s;ts there not only their Learning, but their manner of conveying it in Fables and Hiero|glyphicks. This is nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;ider'd by tho&s;e who would thoroughly penetrate into the Beauty and De|&s;ign of many Parts of this Author. For whoever reflects that this was the Mode of Learning in tho&s;e Times, will make no doubt but there are &s;everal My&s;teries both of Natural and Moral Philo&s;ophy involv'd in his Ficti|ons, which otherwi&s;e in the literal Meaning appear too tri|vial or irrational; and it is but ju&s;t, when the&s;e are not plain or immediately intelligible, to imagine that &s;omething of this kind may be hid under them. Neverthele&s;s, as <HI>Homer</HI> tra|vell'd not with a direct View of writing Philo&s;ophy or Theo|logy, &s;o he might often u&s;e the&s;e Hieroglyphical Fables and Traditions as Embelli&s;hments of his Poetry only, without taking the Pains to open their my&s;tical Meaning to his Rea|ders, and perhaps without diving very deeply into it him&s;elf.</P>

collected by <HI>Eu&s;tathius.

<P>Others affirm, that by this golden Chain may be meant the Days of the World's Duration, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, which are as it were painted by the Lu&s;tre of the Sun, and follow one another in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Chain till they arrive at their final Pe|riod: While <HI>Jupiter</HI> or the <HI>Aether</HI> (which the Ancients call'd the Soul of all Things) &s;till remains unchanged.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Theaetetus</HI> &s;ays that by this golden Chain is meant the Sun, who&s;e Rays enliven all Nature and cement the Parts of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stoicks</HI> will have it that by <HI>Jupiter</HI> is implied De&s;ti|ny, which over-rules every thing both upon, and above the Earth.</P>
<P>Others (delighted with their own Conceits) imagine that <HI>Homer</HI> intended to repre&s;ent the Excellence of Monarchy; that the Sceptre ought to be &s;way'd by one Hand, and that all the Wheels of Government &s;hould be put in Motion by one Per&s;on.</P>
<P>But I fancy a much better Interpretation may be found for this, if we allow (as there is great Rea&s;on to believe) that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> under&s;tood the true Sy&s;tem of the World, and that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> fir&s;t learn'd it from them.

I have already taken notice in the Preface of the Method of tran&s;lating the Epithets of <HI>Homer,</HI> and mu&s;t add here, that it is often only the Uncertainty the Mo|derns lie under, of the true genuine Signification of an
<PB N="306" REF="300">
ancient word, which cau&s;es the many various Con&s;tructions of it. So that it is probable the Author's own Words, at the time he u&s;ed them, never meant half &s;o many things as we tran&s;late them into. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> generally ob&s;erves one Practice as to the&s;e throughout her Ver&s;ion: She ren|ders almo&s;t every &s;uch Epithet in <HI>Greek</HI> by two or three in <HI>French,</HI> from a fear of lo&s;ing the lea&s;t part of its Signifi|cance. This perhaps may be excu&s;able in Pro&s;e; tho' at be&s;t it makes the whole much more verbo&s;e and tedious, and is rather like writing a Dictionary than rendring an Author: But in Ver&s;e, every Reader knows &s;uch a Redoubling of Epi|thets would not be tolerable. A Poet has therefore only to chu&s;e that, which mo&s;t agrees with the Tenor and main In|tent of the particular Pa&s;&s;age, or with the Genius of Poetry it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is plain that too &s;crupulous an Adherence to many of the&s;e, gives the Tran&s;lation an exotic, pedantic, and whim&s;ical Air, which it is not to be imagined the Original ever had. To call a Hero the <HI>great Artificer of Flight,</HI> the <HI>&s;wift of Foot,</HI> or the <HI>Hor&s;e-tamer,</HI> the&s;e give us Ideas of little Pecu|liarities, when in the Author's Time they were Epithets u&s;ed only in general to &s;ignify Alacrity, Agility, and Vigor. A common Reader would imagine from the&s;e &s;ervile Ver&s;ions, that <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> were Foot-Racers, and <HI>Hector</HI> a Hor&s;e-Cour&s;er, rather than that any of them were Heroes.
