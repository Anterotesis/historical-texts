<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE any ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations can be made upon the two Heads which we are now to con&s;ider, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to let the Reader a little in|to the general Knowledge of the State of the Commerce between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> as it now &s;tands; and this cannot be done &s;o as to give him a clear Under&s;tanding in the reading either the Treaty it &s;elf, or the&s;e Con&s;iderations, without letting him know what the Meaning of the Tariff of 1664, and the Tariff of 1699, &s;o often now to be made mention of is, and as far as will con&s;i&s;t with the Brevity of this Tract, to give an Abridgement of tho&s;e Tariffs, as they concern the pre&s;ent Treaty of Commerce. The Nece&s;&s;ity of under&s;tanding the&s;e Things per|fectly before we can make any Judgment of the Matter in hand, is &s;uch, that it &s;eems the mo&s;t natural Introduction that could po&s;&s;ibly be made to the Work, and without which, however the Book is written in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it would be an un|known Tongue to mo&s;t of the Readers, and might as well have been written in <HI>Arabick,</HI> or any other Language or Character which no body could under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
A <HI>TARIFF in the French,</HI> as it may be&s;t be expounded to us in a Trading-Dialect, is no more or le&s;s than <HI>a Book of Rates,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hing the Duties and Cu&s;toms of Goods exported and imported from and to the Kingdom of <HI>France:</HI> It is true, if you &s;peak literally, it is the Acts of publick Authority, from whence the Books of Rates are collected, as our <HI>Books of Rates</HI> are, &s;o many Ab&s;tracts of the Acts of Parliament, by which tho&s;e Rates are e&s;tabli&s;he'd; and therefore, as our Laws of Cu&s;toms are called Acts of Par|liament, &s;o tho&s;e in <HI>France</HI> are called <HI>Edits du Roy, Declaration du Roy, Ordonnance du Roy, Ar|re&s;t du Con&s;eild' Etat du Roy,</HI> and the like; and the Collection of them into a Body is call'd in <HI>French Recueil des Tarifs,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Table de Tarifs Arre&s;ts &amp; Reglemens des Droits de Entree &amp; Sortie,</HI> &amp;c. that is in <HI>Engli&s;h a Book of Rates,</HI> and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is therefore a Vulgar Error to think the&s;e Tariffs are Treaties between <HI>France</HI> and other Nations, and to &s;ay the Tariff between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> or between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. is to talk Nou&s;en&s;e, or which is much the &s;ame thing, to &s;ay nothing to the Purpo&s;e, with this Exception only, That in &s;everal Treaties of Com|merce there have been Agreements made, and Articles enter'd into, e&s;pecially between <HI>France</HI> and the States-General, by which the Duties of Merchandi&s;es have been adju&s;ted re&s;pectively; and in the&s;e Treaties the Tariffs in <HI>France,</HI> for|merly made, have been made the Foundation, with &s;uch particular Additions, re&s;pecting the Duties of &s;uch or &s;uch Goods, about which they
<PB N="5" REF="4">
have then treated and made any Alteration. Of this we have an Example; after the Treaty of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> when, by a &s;eparate Treaty of Trade, tho' in former Ca&s;es the Duties in general were adju&s;ted, yet new Agreements were made for &s;un|dry things, the re&s;t being refer'd to the Tariffs of other Years, and this was called indeed <HI>Tarif Ar|re&s;te Entre la France &amp; la Hollande:</HI> This was the 8th of <HI>December</HI> 1699.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary farther, as an Introduction to this Di&s;cour&s;e, to ob&s;erve that the general Tariffs, or Book of Rates, which have been made and are refer'd to in the pre&s;ent Treaties &s;tand thus: That of 1664 was the mo&s;t general, in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchandi&s;es and Manufactures paid, upon their Importation into <HI>France,</HI> very moderate Duties; and particularly of our Woollen Manifactures: Thus, <TABLE>

<P>And the like of other Merchandi&s;es. The&s;e Duties were enlarg'd in the Year 1699, and by an <HI>Arre&s;t du Con&s;eil de E&s;tat,</HI> 6. <HI>Sept.</HI> 1701, an en|tire Prohibition of our Woollen Manufactures was publi&s;h'd, and new extravagant Duties laid upon tho&s;e which were allow'd to be enter'd.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
The&s;e Things being nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e by way of Introduction on the Side of the <HI>French,</HI> it may &s;uffice on the other Part to ob&s;erve, that by &s;undry Acts of Parliament made on &s;everal Occa|&s;ions, and with various Pro&s;pects in <HI>England,</HI> &s;eve|ral additional Duties, and &s;ome Prohibitions have been laid upon and again&s;t the Goods and Mer|chandi&s;es of the Growth of <HI>France,</HI> be&s;ides the general Prohibition, or final Stop, of Intercour&s;e, or Commerce between the two Nations, occa|&s;ion'd by the Accident of the War.</P>
<P>As to particular Prohibitions, the chief are tho&s;e fir&s;t again&s;t Alamodes and Lu&s;trings, in fa|vour of the Company, who have erected the Ma|nufactures of that kind here, and who, if tho&s;e Prohibitions had not been made could not have &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, that for a Prohibition of all wrought Silks, for the Encouragement of the Broad-Wea|vers in <HI>England,</HI> and without which they mu&s;t have been reduc'd, if not quite ruin'd.</P>
<P>The high additional Duties were &s;uch as prin|cipally re&s;pect the Wines and Brandies imported hither from <HI>France,</HI> which by the &s;everal Acts of Parliament e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e Duties amount at this time as follows:<TABLE>

<P>The&s;e Duties being &s;o great as to be equal al|mo&s;t to a Prohibition, &s;tand as an Equivalent to the Impo&s;itions which the <HI>French</HI> have laid upon ours, and is the Foundation of the pre&s;ent De|bate.</P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS ON THE Articles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As our Con&s;iderations extend to no other Part of the Treaty than what relates to Trade, and to the Duties and Impo&s;itions upon Merchandi&s;e, &s;o we &s;hall confine it according to the Title to the two particular Articles which have made &s;o much Noi&s;e in the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> the Eighth and Ninth Articles.</P>
<P>The Eighth Article runs thus:<Q>Furthermore it is agreed and concluded as a ge|neral Rule, That all and &s;ingular the Subjects of the mo&s;t Serene Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and of the mo&s;t Serene the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, in all Countries and Places &s;ubject to their Power on each Side, as to all Duties, Impo&s;itions, or Cu&s;toms what&s;oever, concerning Per&s;ons, Goods and Merchandizes, Ships, Freights, Seamen, Navigation and Commerce, &s;hall u&s;e and enjoy the &s;ame Privileges, and Immunities at lea&s;t, and have the like favour in all Things, as well in the Courts of Ju&s;tice, as in all &s;uch things as relate either to Commerce, or to any other Right whatever, which any Foreign Nation, the mo&s;t fa|voured,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
has, u&s;es, and enjoys, or may hereafter have, u&s;e, and enjoy.</Q></P>
<P>This Article propo&s;es an Equality in the gene|ral Circum&s;tances of Trade for the Subjects of the two Nations, in their re&s;pective Dominions, with the Subjects of other Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>France</HI> &s;hall not demand any Toll, Duty, Cu&s;tom, Impo&s;t, Port-Charges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants, in any Ports or places of her Dominions, more than the Subjects of all other Nations pay in the &s;ame Ports, and <HI>Vice Ver&s;a England</HI> &s;hall do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I know it is objected here that this Article di|rectly contravenes the Treaty with <HI>Portugal,</HI> and &s;ome People lay a great Stre&s;s upon that Treaty, in which we are oblig'd to admit the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines at a certain Rate or Duty lower than the <HI>French.</HI> Whether the Parliament will think that Treaty relates to a farther Term than the Expi|ration of the War, I &s;hall not determine; and this is named becau&s;e &s;ome in&s;i&s;t upon it, that that Treaty was made for Con&s;iderations which wholly related to the War, and which Con|&s;iderations, or Conditions, on the behalf of <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> as has been mention'd in Parliament, were not honourably and punctually perform'd. <HI>Vide the Votes of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> and Repre&s;en|tation and Addre&s;s la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion. Now, how far the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will think Her &s;elf bound by that Treaty, which, on the other hand, they &s;ay, was never perform'd, is the Que&s;tion the&s;e People offer in this Ca&s;e: But this I &s;hall not take upon me to determine of here, but leave it to the Ca&s;ui&s;ts in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, who&s;e Judgments
<PB N="9" REF="8">
are founded on the Laws of Nations, and the Nature of Treaties.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;iderations of Trade are of a dif|fering Nature; and tho' there were much more to be &s;aid for the Intere&s;t of the Kingdom, re|&s;pecting Peace and War, than we think can be &s;aid here, yet tho&s;e things weight not in Argu|ments of Commerce: The pre&s;ent Enquiry is, Whether the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> Trades are of mo&s;t Advantage to <HI>England?</HI> Many Arguments offer them&s;elves to our View upon this Head, but I believe no Man will pretend to &s;ay, but that as Things &s;tand now, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade is much more to the general Profit than the <HI>French,</HI> be|cau&s;e, <HI>be&s;ides many other Rea&s;ons,</HI> we make ef|fectual Exportation of our Woollen Manufa|ctures for all the Wines, Oyles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we receive from <HI>Portugal;</HI> whereas the Ob&s;tructions in <HI>France</HI> to our Woollen Goods by the War, and the Improvements made in <HI>France,</HI> not only in our Woollen Manufactures, but in many other things, makes that Trade run in a different Chan|nel, and the Ballance, at lea&s;t, before our Stop to their Wine, Brandy, and wrought Silks, by the high Duties and Prohibitions now in force were again&s;t <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument brought again&s;t the&s;e things by tho&s;e who think the Equality of Duties rea|&s;onable; at lea&s;t, the Argument which is mo&s;t Cogent is this. It may be true, that while our Trade to <HI>France</HI> lies under the Di&s;couragements and Di&s;advantages of their Tariffs of 1699, and 1701; the Lo&s;s is Ours, becau&s;e we export but few of our Woollen Manufactures thither. But
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the Que&s;tion is not yet thought of, How great a Trade we may have to <HI>France,</HI> a Kingdom of &s;o large Extent, &s;o populous, and &s;o wanting Ma|nufactures of Wooll, when tho&s;e high Duties are taken off, and the Tariff of 1664 re&s;tor'd, as by the Ninth Article is propos'd?</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, &s;tate this as impartially be|tween both as po&s;&s;ible. We are &s;ure that now the Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> is not only a great, but a gainful Trade, and we know it is an encrea&s;ed and an encrea&s;ing Trade, al&s;o it is a Trade, <HI>as is mention'd above,</HI> e&s;pecially advantageous to <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> in that our whole Import from thence is ballanc'd by our Woollen Manufacture, and great Sums brought hither, in Specie of Gold, every Year. This, as it is &s;aid, we are &s;ure of, and it can be no Offence to any to &s;ay, we hope that when Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall meet as is provided by the Ninth Article to remove the Difficulties, and to regulate mutually the Duties and Circum|&s;tances of Trade, they will be very careful to prevent breaking in too far upon &s;o beneficial a Trade as that to <HI>Portugal,</HI> before they have a clear View of making, at lea&s;t an equal Advan|tage to <HI>Britain</HI> in the Trade to <HI>France;</HI> and this may &s;uffice to &s;ay at pre&s;ent upon the Affair of general Equallities in Commerce, which is the Su&s;tance of the Eighth Article.</P>
<P>The Ninth Article requires a farther Di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, and may be particularly divided into three Periods or Heads.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The propo&s;al of repealing the Laws on ei|ther hand, which relate to additional Impo&s;t, and Duties on Merchandizes in both Kingdoms,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and all the Prohibitions of Importation al&s;o, from the Year 1664.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The &s;ettling the Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Goods imported into <HI>England</HI> upon the &s;ame Foot, and at the &s;ame Rates upon which Goods of the like Nature are imported from other Parts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The appointing Commi&s;&s;ioners not only to adju&s;t the Exceptions and &s;eparate Propo&s;als which are not yet &s;ettled, but to regulate the Me|thods of future Commerce between the Nations, in &s;uch a manner as may be for mutual Advan|tage.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The two fir&s;t of the&s;e are contain'd in the fir&s;t Part of the Ninth Article of the Treaty, in the&s;e Words:<Q>It is further agreed, That within the &s;pace of two Months after a Law &s;hall be made in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> whereby it &s;hall be &s;ufficiently provided that no more Cu&s;toms or Duties be paid for Goods and Merchandizes brought from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than what are payable for Goods and Mer|chandizes of the like Nature, Imported into <HI>Great Britain</HI> from any other Country in <HI>Europe;</HI> and that all Laws made in <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;ince the Year 1664, for Prohibiting the Importation of any Goods and Merchandizes coming from <HI>France,</HI> which were not prohibited before that time, be repealed, the ge|neral Tariff made in <HI>France</HI> the 18th Day of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> in the Year 1664. &s;hall take place there again, and the Duties payable in <HI>France</HI> by the Sub|jects of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for Goods Imported and Exported, &s;hall be paid according to the Tenour of the Tariff abovementioned, and &s;hall not exceed the Rule therein &s;ettled, in the Provinces whereof men|tion
<PB N="12" REF="11">
is there made, and in the other Provinces the Duty &s;hall not be payable, otherwi&s;e than according to the Rule at that time pre&s;cribed; And all Pro|hibitions, Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations or Decrees made in <HI>France</HI> &s;ince the &s;aid Tariff of the Year 1664, and contrary thereunto, in re&s;pect to the Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hall be Repealed.</Q></P>
<P>To con&s;ider this with all po&s;&s;ible Impartiali|ty. It mu&s;t be allow'd, that the <HI>French</HI> binding them&s;elves to Repeal all their Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations or Decrees, made in <HI>France,</HI> back to the Year 1664, entitled them very ju&s;tly to in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;ame Thing with us; and were we &s;ure that Repealing tho&s;e Tariffs would open the Door to a Free Trade for our Manufacturers into <HI>France,</HI> that Demand would meet with the le&s;s Difficulties here, and the Alternative be the more ju&s;t. Of which we &s;hall &s;ay more when we come to enquire into the Excepted Articles.</P>
<P>But altho' this may &s;eem very Ju&s;t for the <HI>French</HI> to demand, yet it will require &s;ome Retro&s;pect upon our own Circum&s;tances, to con&s;ider whether it con&s;i&s;ts with our Trading Intere&s;t to come into this Mutual Repealing of Duties and Prohibitions; and indeed whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with the very Nature and Being of our Trade: As particularly, the taking off the Prohibition of <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> which we call <HI>Broad Silks,</HI> and that &s;evere Prohibition of <HI>Ala|modes</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;trings.</HI></P>
<P>It might require here &s;ome very mature Thoughts to reflect upon the State of our own Trade; <HI>for Example,</HI> The Encouragement given to the Making <HI>Lu&s;trings</HI> and <HI>Alamodes</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
and upon which the Sub&s;cribers to the <HI>Lu&s;tring-Company</HI> embark'd their Stocks was, without que&s;tion, the Prohibition of the <HI>French Silks</HI> of that Kind, and the Confidence they had, that if at any time that Prohibition expired, they &s;hould obtain that Encouragement which is generally granted to all New Undertakings of that Nature, and without which they are &s;up|po&s;ed not to be able to promote or &s;et up &s;uch Works, or at lea&s;t with any Succe&s;s; this En|couragement is generally the laying large Im|po&s;itions, or actual Prohibitions, upon Goods of the &s;ame Nature made in other Countries: But if on the contrary the Impo&s;itions and Pro|hibitions afore&s;aid are actually taken off, and the Trade laid open, &s;o that the like Goods may be admitted upon low Terms from Abroad, tho&s;e Undertakings are Ruin'd of meer Con&s;e|quence. This I take to be the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Lu|&s;tring-Company</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and I believe the Ma&s;ter or Members of that Company will be free to own that they can make but &s;mall Pre|tence to the carrying on their &s;aid Trade, if the Prohibition and Duty upon the <HI>French Lu&s;trings</HI> and <HI>Alamodes</HI> &s;hould be taken off by this Trea|ty. What Weight the Intere&s;t of the Company &s;hall bear in the Con&s;ideration of this Great Affair, when either the Parliament in general, or the Commi&s;&s;ioners when nominated to enquire into it in particular, &s;hall come to debate it, I will not undertake to determine.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of our <HI>Broad Weavers</HI> may come next to be mention'd, in Favour of whom, and in Con&s;ideration of the Numbers of Families
<PB N="14" REF="13">
maintain'd by the Manufacture of <HI>Silk</HI> in this Nation, the General Prohibition of <HI>French Wrought Silks</HI> fir&s;t, and afterwards of <HI>Ea&s;t-India Wrought Silks</HI> was made. What other Con&s;ide|rations moved the Hou&s;e to tho&s;e Prohibitions, and how importunate the <HI>Weavers</HI> and Importers of <HI>Silk</HI> were to obtain tho&s;e Prohibitions, is too fre&s;h in the Memories of all Men who think of the&s;e Things, that I need not repeat any thing of it here: What a Hurt it will be to the <HI>Silk Manufacture</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> I rather leave to the People concern'd to talk of, who are apt to be loud enough, than to pretend to meddle with it here.</P>
<P>It is argued here, that the Encrea&s;e of the Exportation of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> will follow, by taking off the high Duties in <HI>France,</HI> by which that whole Nation will be open to our Sale, and we &s;hall Export va&s;t Quantities thi|ther Yearly; I &s;ay, if this be urged as a thing of &s;uch Weight, to which the Lo&s;s in the <HI>Silk Manufactures, &amp;c.</HI> is not to be compared, <HI>I rea|dily yield to it,</HI> only with this Provi&s;o, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that we are certain that Exportation &s;hall &s;o increa&s;e. I &s;hall allow my &s;elf to hope it will do &s;o, at lea&s;t if the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who are to meet, can bring the <HI>French</HI> to con&s;ent that the <HI>Engli&s;h Woollen Manufactures</HI> be compri&s;ed in the Treaty, and the Duties upon them be re|duced to the Tariff of 1664. Nor will I allow that to be a Que&s;tion in the Ca&s;e, &s;ince the known Intere&s;t of their Country &s;o much re|quires it, and the Ruin or Damage to other parts of our Trade will be &s;o ju&s;t an Equiva|lent.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
But as that Notion of the Increa&s;e of our <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> is an An&s;wer to the Na|tion in general, &s;o here may be an An&s;wer &s;ug|ge&s;ted to the <HI>Broad Silk Weavers</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;tring-Company</HI> in particular, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That altho' the Prohibitions be taken off, yet &s;till there &s;eems to be a liberty left to <HI>Britain,</HI> by this <HI>Ninth Article,</HI> to continue or lay any higher Duty on &s;uch Foreign <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> as the Government &s;hall think needful, to encourage our <HI>Silk Ma|nufactures,</HI> and yet the <HI>French</HI> be obliged to Re|peal their high Duties at the &s;ame time. This, I &s;ay, &s;eems plain at lea&s;t to our common view, who can judge of the&s;e Things but without doors, from the&s;e two Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>1. From the Demand the <HI>French</HI> make of keeping four Species of Goods up to the Rule of the Tariff of 1699, which if they in&s;i&s;t upon, there &s;eems to be a Parity of Rea&s;on that our Commi&s;&s;ioners may in&s;i&s;t upon the like advance of a Duty on the <HI>Wrought Silks</HI> made in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> (1.) Becau&s;e the Rea&s;on of the <HI>French</HI> for holding up their Duties on our <HI>Woollen Ma|nufactures</HI> to the Tariff of 1699, is the very &s;ame which we would give for Laying a Duty on their <HI>Silks; (viz.)</HI> the giving the Manufa|ctures at Home the Advantage again&s;t tho&s;e which are Imported from Abroad, and encou|raging the proper Subjects of each Kingdom. (2.) Becau&s;e it does not contradict the Letter of the Treaty to Lay any new or high Duties or Cu&s;toms upon the Goods and Merchandizes of any Kind Imported from <HI>France,</HI> provided it is no more than is paid upon Goods of the
<PB N="16" REF="15">
like Nature Imported from other Parts; and I mu&s;t grant, that if this Con&s;truction of the Ar|ticle will hold, as I hope and believe it will, the Prohibitions may be all Taken off of the <HI>Broad Silks, Lu&s;trings, Alamodes,</HI> &amp;c. without &s;uch Ruin and De&s;truction to the <HI>Broad Silk Weaving</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;tring Trade</HI> as has been appre|hended. But as the Mini&s;try on both &s;ides mu&s;t be allowed the Con&s;truction of their own Terms, and to explain their own Thoughts to one ano|ther, &s;o it may not be proper to anticipate all the Thoughts our Commi&s;&s;ioners may have, lea&s;t it prepare the Enemy to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are no more to be look'd upon in Trade as they formerly were, <HI>(viz)</HI> as an Improving and Encroaching People in re&s;pect to the General Commerce of <HI>Europe,</HI> but as a Nation arriv'd to &s;uch an Improvement, that they are really our Rivals in the be&s;t and great|e&s;t Part of our Trade in particular, I mean the <HI>Woollen Manufacture.</HI> Indeed we have the good Fortune to be on the better &s;ide of the Hedge with them, and they have the Difficulty of the Want of Materials to &s;truggle with, <HI>(viz.) the WOOLL.</HI> But then again&s;t that, by their Art, dexterous Management, Money, and other Helps, joined to the Ba&s;ene&s;s and Treachery of our own People, who for Private Gain will &s;et their Hands to the Ruin of their Country, They have found the way, in &s;pight of &s;evere Laws, &s;trict Guards, and the utmo&s;t Vigilance of Officers, to get &s;o great Quantities of our <HI>Wooll</HI> conveyed over to <HI>France,</HI> as &s;ufficiently enables them, in Conjunction with <HI>Spani&s;h Wooll</HI> and
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>Wooll</HI> from <HI>Barbary,</HI> to make a very great Quan|tity of <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> and thereby do us an Ine&s;timable Damage in our Trade; and which is yet more, as the People are Poor, Indu&s;trious, and work very low; where they are able to make the Goods at all, they are &s;ure to underwork and under&s;ell us.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on it mu&s;t be allow'd, that if the <HI>French</HI> can be brought to open a Door for a free Trade, that is, for an Importation of our <HI>Wool|len Manufactures</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> with moderate Du|ties, the Value and Gooodne&s;s of our <HI>Manu|factures</HI> would force their own way &s;o far, at lea&s;t, that the Advance they make upon us in tho&s;e things would not be &s;o great, or encrea&s;e &s;o fa&s;t: In order then to come to &s;uch a free Trade, many things may be thought on, and it may be counted rational, that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould grant all they can be &s;uppos'd to grant, and take every Step that can conduce to that main End and De&s;ign, which they can take and grant without Prejudice to their own Nation, and to the main Trade thereof, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> in &s;ome other Branch; for to do thus, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to yeild what would be fatal to it in another Part, would be to build with one Hand, and pull down with another.</P>
<P>This brings us then to the &s;econd Head, men|tion'd above.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The &s;ettling the Duties upon</HI> French <HI>Goods, upon an Equality with the Duties on Goods of the like Nature imported from foreign Coun|tries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
This, <HI>as is noted above,</HI> &s;ignifies not at all, <HI>as I can under&s;tand it,</HI> an entire Reduction of our Impo&s;t and Cu&s;toms upon <HI>French</HI> Goods, or as the Article at fir&s;t View &s;eem'd to &s;ugge&s;t, and as many &s;till under&s;tand it to take off all our new Impo&s;itions &s;ince the Year 1664, but rather an Agreement with <HI>France,</HI> that as Peace is re&s;tor'd between the two Nations, and they &s;tand to one another upon an Equality of general Intere&s;t, in the &s;ame relation <HI>of Neighbourhood</HI> one to ano|ther, &s;o they &s;hould <HI>of Trade</HI> al&s;o; and the Equa|lity of Duties upon Goods of like Sort, I laid down as the Foundation of this Equality. Tho&s;e who are of Opinion that an Equality of all Na|tions in Trade is requi&s;ite, mu&s;t produce other Arguments to back that Opinion than I'have &s;een yet, unle&s;s by Equalities they will make &s;uitable Allowances for tie different Scituations of Coun|tries, Quality of Goods, and Circum&s;tances of Trade.</P>
<P>Now let others put what Con&s;truction they will upon the Ninth Article, and upon the Meaning of tho&s;e Words, <HI>the &s;ame Duties,</HI> and <HI>Goods of like nature,</HI> I mu&s;t be allow'd to think that it is implied that Allowances and Regulations mu&s;t be made, in order to bring the Nature of Things <HI>to be like,</HI> and the Duties to <HI>be the &s;ame;</HI> Things may be &s;aid to <HI>be the &s;ame,</HI> when by ju&s;t Allow|ances and Proportions they are regulated and ad|ju&s;ted, and brought to an Equality; on the con|trary, tho' the Sum paid upon any Goods <HI>be the &s;ame,</HI> yet it may give one Side a great Inequality and Advantage over the other; and that which is the &s;ame thing in the Letter, is not the &s;ame in the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
The&s;e are things cannot be rea&s;on'd upon &s;o well before hand, as they will be debated and cal|culated upon a Per&s;onal Treaty with Commi&s;|&s;ioners, and therefore, I &s;ay, no Judgment can be made at pre&s;ent by a common Eye: But that every Body may judge a little what may be the State of our Trade, when this Door of Inter|cour&s;e and Commerce is open'd, it may not be improper to look back, and &s;ee what the Trade was formerly, and to know thereby what we are like to expect, when the high Duties are taken off from the <HI>French</HI> Goods here.</P>
<P>It is true, that Dr. <HI>Davenant,</HI> in his Report, from the Books of the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> to the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, named in the Act for taking, exa|mining, and &s;tating the Publick Accounts, ob|&s;erves, that in the Four Years Interval of Peace, at the latter End of King <HI>William,</HI> we exported to <HI>France</HI> only thus, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> in our <HI>Wool|len Manufactures</HI> only.</P>

To de&s;cend to farther Particulars: They &s;ay that in the Year 1685, there was Twenty Thou|&s;and Tons of <HI>Wine,</HI> and Six Thou&s;and Tons of <HI>Brandy,</HI> Imported into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France;</HI> and more e&s;pecially, that from . . . . . <HI>Anno</HI> 1688, to . . . . 1689, there was upwards of the &s;aid Quantity of Twenty Thou&s;and Tons of <HI>Wine,</HI> and Six Thou&s;and Tons of <HI>Brandy,</HI> Im|ported.</P>
<P>It would be Unju&s;t, at this time of day, to let &s;uch Accounts as the&s;e lye open for every one to pa&s;s their Judgments of, without giving the Opinion of him that publi&s;hes them, be|cau&s;e the Rea&s;on and De&s;ign of the making them publick will very much lye in the giving, or not giving, that Opinion; and therefore I think my &s;elf bound to own, that I do not look on the &s;aid Account to have any Foundation in the Matter of Fact, or in the Nature of the Thing: And therefore as it does not Comport with the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> Books of tho&s;e Years, &s;o neither does it to me appear Rea&s;onable. Howbeit being given in to the late King by &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;o qualified to know, and who were under &s;uch Obligations to do it exactly, I &s;hall &s;ay no more to it but this, That no Man need go any farther for a Rea&s;on why the late King appear'd very backward, after the Peace of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> to enter upon any Treaty of Com|merce with <HI>France,</HI> or to open the &s;ame by Tak|ing off the &s;aid high Duties, which at that time and 'till now have been as a Prohibition on both &s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
And I cannot wonder, why any Man who may have drawn his Calculate of Things from the&s;e E&s;timates, &s;hould be of the &s;ame mind now; for certain it is, that no Export which we can hope for of our Woollen Manufactures to <HI>France,</HI> can ever come up to Balance &s;uch an Account as this, nay, tho' the King of <HI>France</HI> were willing to Take off and Revoke all his Ta|riffs to 1664, and the Tariff of 1664 too.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> Books make it appear, as is al&s;o to be &s;een in the &s;aid Report of Dr. <HI>Davenant,</HI> that the whole Im|port of <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandy</HI> in the Year from <HI>Mi|chaelma&s;s</HI> 1668, to <HI>Michaelma&s;s</HI> 1669, came out thus;<TABLE>

<P>How much of this Wine &s;hall in a future Trade be imported from <HI>France,</HI> is hard to determine; &s;ome alledge the whole Draught of Red Wines will come from thence; but this is running too far and too fa&s;t, for even before the War, tho' the Duties of <HI>French</HI> Wines were much lower than the Duties of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Wines, yet there were always great Quantities of <HI>Alicant, Florence, Bar a Bar,</HI> and <HI>Oporto</HI> Wines brought in, which, by rea&s;on of the deepne&s;s and bright|ne&s;s, of the Colour or Face of the Wines, were always found u&s;eful by the <HI>Vintners</HI> to draw with their thin meaner <HI>French</HI> Wines, and &s;old at a much greater Price; and if, as &s;ometimes it hap|pen'd, the Vintage in <HI>France</HI> fail'd, or the Wines prov'd &s;mall and ill colour'd, the Quantity and Price of the Wines from <HI>Lisbon, Oporto, Alicant, &amp;c.</HI> always encreas'd in Proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
If this was the Ca&s;e then, when the Duties of tho&s;e other Wines were about 7<HI>l. per</HI> Ton grea|ter than the Duties of the <HI>French,</HI> we may rea|&s;onably hope it will be &s;till &s;o, and with more Ad|vantage to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines, when the Duties of the <HI>French</HI> Wines &s;hall be made Equal.</P>
<P>But here comes in an Objection, which was hinted at before, upon the Subject of what you will call Equality, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Alicant, Florence,</HI> and <HI>Lisbon</HI> Wines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> come in here at a grea|ter Expence, both in their fir&s;t Co&s;t, as al&s;o in their Freight, Cask, length of the Voyage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than the <HI>French;</HI> and thus, therefore, if the <HI>French</HI> Wines pay but an equal Duty, yet the Trade is not thereby put upon an Equality, but the Ad|vantage given to the <HI>French,</HI> and that a Propor|tion ought to be &s;tated here, to bring this Matter to an Equality.</P>
<P>This may have &s;ome Weight in it, and as I can do no more than mention it here, &s;o I cannot prevail upon my &s;elf to doubt but the Govern|ment will take Care to have the Di&s;proportion con&s;ider'd in the further Debates they are to have of that Affair.</P>
<P>As to the Treaties with <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the Conditions to be perform'd in that part of the Ca&s;e with the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> they are not for a Subject to di&s;pute, but mu&s;t be left to the Con&s;ideration of Parliament, to whom it be|longs, and who no doubt will do what is requi|&s;ite in that Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It remains now to examine a little into that part of the Ninth Article which &s;peaks of the
<PB N="26" REF="25">
excepted Species of Goods, and of appointing Commi&s;&s;aries to regulate the Duties and Diffe|rences of tho&s;e Species, according to the Tenor of the other part of the Agreement: This is contained in the following words of the Article it &s;elf, (viz.) <Q>But whereas it is urged on the Part of <HI>France,</HI> that certain Merchandizes, that is to &s;ay, Manufactures of Wooll, Sugar, Salted Fi&s;h, and the Product of Whales be excepted out of the Rule of the above-mentioned Tariff, and likewi&s;e other Heads of Matters belonging to this Treaty remain, which having been propo&s;ed on the part of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> have not yet been mutually adju&s;t|ed, a Specification of all which is contained in a &s;eparate In&s;trument Sub&s;cribed by the Amba&s;&s;adors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiaries on both &s;ides; It is hereby Provided and Agreed, that within two Months from the Exchange of the Ratifications of this Treaty, Commi&s;&s;aries on both &s;ides &s;hall meet at <HI>London,</HI> to con&s;ider of, and remove the Diffi|culties concerning the Merchandizes to be excepted out of the Tariff of the Year 1664, and concern|ing the other Heads, which, as is above&s;aid, are not yet wholly adju&s;ted. And at the &s;ame time the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;aries &s;hall likewi&s;e endeavour, (which &s;eems to be very much for the Intere&s;t of both Nations) to have the Methods of Commerce on one part, and of the other, more thoroughly ex|amined, and to find out and e&s;tabli&s;h ju&s;t and be|neficial means on both &s;ides for removing the Diffi|culties in this matter, and for regulating the Du|ties mutually. But it is always under&s;tood and provided, that all and &s;ingular the Articles of this Treaty, do in the mean while remain in their full

force, and e&s;pecially that nothing be deemed, under any Pretence what&s;oever, to hinder the benefit of the General Tariff of the Year 1664, from being granted to the Subjects of Her Royal Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects from having and enjoying the &s;ame, without any Delay or Tergiver&s;ation, within the &s;pace of two Months after a Law is made in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as above|&s;aid, in as ample manner and form as the Subjects of any Nation, the most favoured, might have and enjoy the benefit of the afore&s;aid Tariff, any thing to be done, or di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the &s;aid Commi&s;|&s;aries, to the contrary in any wi&s;e notwith&s;tand|ing.</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems here that the four Species of Goods mentioned, <HI>(viz.) Fi&s;h,</HI> produce of <HI>Whale,</HI> that is, <HI>Whale Fins</HI> and <HI>Oyl, Sugar</HI> Refin'd, and <HI>Woollen Maenufactures,</HI> &s;hall be excepted out of this Ar|ticle; that is to &s;ay, out of the Tariff of 1664: But what then, &s;ay we, &s;ignify all the re&s;t, for our Woollen Manufacture is the main thing which we have to in&s;i&s;t upon, if this &s;hould not be adju&s;ted then the whole Trade is gone? It is to be hoped, that the Wi&s;dom of our Parlia|ment will provide, That unle&s;s &s;uch a Method may be found out that our Manufactures may be admitted into <HI>France</HI> upon &s;uch Terms as will make them Vendible there, and that they may not only come to Market, but may have a Market to come to where they will be Sold, they will be very Cautious how they make a Law to Take off our high Duties and Prohibi|tions upon the <HI>French</HI> Goods; for this would
<PB N="28" REF="27">
be to Ruin us effectually, by admitting <HI>French</HI> Goods of all kinds into <HI>England,</HI> and having our Woollen Manufactures, in effect, prohi|bited.</P>
<P>The great Que&s;tion then is, What is the Tariff of 1699, which the Articles make men|tion of, and what is the Difference between that and 1664? And to An&s;wer this directly it is to be under&s;tood, that there is no &s;uch thing in <HI>France</HI> as a Tariff of 1699, that re&s;pects <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, other than that mentioned before made with <HI>Holland,</HI> by which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fine Broad Cloth is Taxed at 20 Livres for 25 Ells <HI>French, (viz.)</HI> for about 30 to 31 Yards more than they were Charged before, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by the Tariff of 1664, and Serges, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in proportion. This Addition is the Thing upon which it &s;eems turns the Que&s;tion between a Trade and no Trade with <HI>France.</HI> If this Addition will effect a Prohibition, the King of <HI>France</HI> cannot in&s;i&s;t upon it when he propo&s;es a Treaty of Trade; for that would be to have us open our Trade to him, and &s;hut up his Trade from us: But if the <HI>French</HI> King is in Earne&s;t to &s;eek a Treaty of Commerce with us, then the Difference be|tween the Tariff of 1664 and 1699 is &s;o little, that he cannot &s;cruple to give it up: Be&s;ides, as by the Eighth Article, <Q>the Subjects of <HI>Britain</HI> are to enjoy all tho&s;e Privileges, Liberties and Immu|nities, and have the like favour in all things as to all Duties, Impo&s;itions or Cu&s;toms what&s;oever, con|cerning Per&s;ons, Goods and Merchandizes, which any Foreign Nation, the mo&s;t favour'd, enjoys, or may hereafter have, u&s;e and enjoy.</Q> If this, I &s;ay,

be agreed, then it will remain to enquire, How the Treaties of Commerce with the <HI>Dutch</HI> and other Nations have &s;ettled this Affair, as to Salted Fi&s;h and Woollen Manufactures; for as to the Produce of Whales it concerns us little, who have no Whale Fi&s;hing; and as to Fi&s;h, the <HI>Dutch</HI> al&s;o are the main Parties concern'd: But as to the Woollen Manufacture, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> have yielded that Point, then we &s;eem to be &s;top'd by the Eighth Article from asking any more; and how far that may con&s;i&s;t with the Sale of our Manufactures in <HI>France</HI> remains to be Examined, and we may hope will be effe|ctually Debated before it be yielded to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Debate which the re&s;pective Commi&s;&s;a|ries to be appointed are to have, as the Article &s;ays <HI>for the Intere&s;t of both Nations,</HI> will no que&s;tion be very agreeable to all Hone&s;t Men, if it may be &s;o adju&s;ted as that our Woollen Manufactures may meet with no Interruption in their Exportation to <HI>France.</HI> No que&s;tion, there may be &s;uch Regulations of Commerce made as may be for the Intere&s;t of both Na|tions, but all mu&s;t be with a &s;uppo&s;ition of ad|mitting our Manufactures into <HI>France</HI> upon Equal and Rea&s;onable Terms; which if it be not done, our Trade is rather prohibited than extended, rather &s;hut up than opened; &s;o that upon this one Article all the re&s;t depends, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Trade be open'd for our Woollen Goods in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>How el&s;e &s;hall we make our &s;elves amends for the Lo&s;s of our Trade in <HI>Portugal?</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing here to the Obligation upon Her Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="30" REF="29">
to the King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> the Government will no doubt concern them&s;elves to pre&s;erve the Conditions of every Agreement with the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> from any Cla&s;hing Incon|&s;i&s;tencies one with another: No more will I un|dertake to &s;ay the <HI>Portugueze</HI> wait to prohibit our Manufactures as &s;oon as they &s;hall hear this Tran&s;action is &s;ettled; I do not believe the <HI>Portugueze</HI> &s;o weak neither: We are told, this will be mo&s;t certain, that whatever amends we may make our &s;elves by the <HI>French</HI> Trade, we &s;hall certainly le&s;&s;en our Wine Trade from <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> and to al&s;o from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and other parts, to whom we at the &s;ame time &s;end very large Quantities of our Manufactures; and therefore if the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> do not make up the Diminution of tho&s;e Trades, it will not then be an Equivalent to us for the Exchange. But we hope the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who are to meet upon this Subject, will concern them&s;elves to weigh this part al&s;o, and &s;o to admit the <HI>French</HI> Trade, that the Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> may not be in a wor&s;e Ca&s;e than it was before the War. Indeed it mu&s;t be Own'd, it would be hard to &s;ugge&s;t that the Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> can be in a wor&s;e &s;tate than it was before the War; when it is known that before the War, the whole Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Wines were not more than 8<HI>l.</HI> or thereabout <HI>per Ton;</HI> and at the &s;ame time the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines paid above 16<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> Duty: And beyond the Years 1664, we do not find any Wines import|ed from <HI>Portugal</HI> at all, but under the Title of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wines; which may be noted, not that there came no Wines from <HI>Portugal</HI> at all; but
<PB N="31" REF="30">
that <HI>Portugal</HI> was then under the Dominion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> 'till the Revolt of the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> the Grandfather of the Pre&s;ent King: I &s;ay then it can hardly be rational to think the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade will be quite &s;unk, or that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> will prohibit Trade with us; but that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines paying the &s;ame Dutys, the fir&s;t will gain the pre|ference at Market, no body will que&s;tion; and therefore it had been to be wi&s;hed, there had been &s;ome little re&s;erv'd advantage to the Trade of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine: But &s;ince it is otherwi&s;e deter|min'd, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade mu&s;t take its Fate; and all that remains &s;eems to be the taking a due Care, that the Trade to <HI>France</HI> for our Ma|nufactures may be &s;o enlarged, as may be a Recompence for what may happen on the other &s;ide; and if this may but appear, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to be the better &s;atisfy'd with the Trea|ty of Commerce; and we &s;hall all be glad to find it &s;o, that the Complaints of tho&s;e, who pretend to fear, nay to know (as they &s;ay) the contrary, may appear to have been without ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Silk Manufacture</HI> is next to be con&s;idered; the <HI>Lu&s;tring Company</HI> is now near expiring, and their Charter, which was granted for <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Years, is almo&s;t run out; whether they will obtain a New Charter or no is not for us to enquire, whatever we may &s;uppo&s;e; but whe|ther they &s;hall or not, it may be the &s;ame thing; the Prohibition, or Duty equal to a Prohibition, upon <HI>Lu&s;trings</HI> and <HI>Alamodes,</HI> if it is to remain, as by the Equality with other Nations mentioned
<PB N="32" REF="31">
in the Treaty, it may, makes a very great Dif|ference in the Manufacture at home, and the Importation from abroad; whether the <HI>Lu&s;tring-Company</HI> can go on or no, is for them to deter|mine: But it mu&s;t be own'd, that if the Dutys on Foreign <HI>Lu&s;trings</HI> are held up at about 35<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> more than the Manufactures of <HI>Lu|&s;trings</HI> at home are valued at, and the <HI>Lu&s;tring-Company</HI> cannot go on, but the Foreign will out|&s;ell them, the making them at home mu&s;t &s;ink under the Imperfections of the Performance, rather than under the mi&s;take of the Treaty of Commerce.</P>
<P>It is true, a Man, who has any Value for the Trade of his Native Country, cannot but regret the misfortune of the Humour of our People in <HI>Britain,</HI> who are &s;o far from Encouraging the Manufactures of their own Country, that they will upon all Occa&s;ions, and almo&s;t in all Ca&s;es, choo&s;e any thing to wear that comes from abroad, and advance in price for &s;uch Goods, without regard to the real Goodne&s;s or Worth of the thing they buy, meerly upon its being Foreign. This puts all Manufacturing, at lea&s;t of Silks, under very great Di&s;couragements, and fre|quently has defeated the End and De&s;ign of ma|ny whole&s;ome and good Laws, which have been made for the Encouragement of our own People; and it is feared, this will &s;till be a help to the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t in Trade, when our Duties on their Goods &s;hall be reduced to an Equality with the Goods and Merchandi&s;es of other Countries; It is true, that this is a Mi&s;chief that ought, if it were po&s;&s;ible, rather to be puni&s;hed than
<PB N="33" REF="32">
Encouraged; but &s;till while this is our Misfor|tune, and we cannot help it, the Government may provide as well again&s;t it in Treaties and Capitulations, as the Nature of &s;uch things will admit.</P>
<P>How far it can be expected, that the Mini&s;ters of State &s;hould in Treaties of Peace and Com|merce allow for the&s;e National Follies, I will not meddle with here; it is mo&s;t certain, that if this Humour of our People prevails after the pre&s;ent Treaty, they may defeat the be&s;t De&s;igns of the Government in the Treaty, and make that mi&s;chievous, which otherwi&s;e would not be &s;o: We had an Eminent Example of this Hu|mour of the People, in the Extravagance of their Fancy after the <HI>Painted Callicoes</HI> and <HI>Fine Chints</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which run on to &s;o ridicu|lous an Extreme, that on a &s;udden you &s;aw all the Ladies of Quality, and wealthy Citizens Wives, dre&s;s'd up in a Tawdry piece of <HI>Callicoe,</HI> which but a few Years before, their Chamber-Maids would have thought beneath them to be &s;een in: Nor was this all, but immediately by the &s;ame Rule our Velvet and Damask-beds, fine Window-curtains, nay the very Hangings of Rooms, were all turn'd into <HI>Painted Callicoes</HI> and <HI>Me&s;lepatan Chints,</HI> to the entire De&s;truction, if it had gone on, of the <HI>Silk Manufacture,</HI> and the exceeding Damage of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> al&s;o: There was no Remedy for this Di&s;temper, <HI>(for no doubt it was a Di&s;temper in our People)</HI> but to qua&s;h it at once by an immediate Prohibition of all <HI>Ea&s;t-India Silks</HI> and <HI>Painted Callicoes,</HI> and forbidding the wearing and making them up,

<P>The&s;e Things are mentioned here for this rea|&s;on, to note, that &s;ince our Fancies are thus de|bauch'd; if po&s;&s;ible then, whatever Treaties of Commerce are made, as much Provi&s;ion ought al&s;o to be made, as the Nature of the Thing will permit, to prevent the ill Con&s;equences of it in our Trade.</P>
<P>It is very well known, that the like Exce&s;s in the Humour and Temper of our People has for many Years pa&s;t appear'd in their Extravagant Pa&s;&s;ion for every thing that is <HI>French,</HI> as well in Wearing Apparel, <HI>Silks,</HI> &amp;c. as in <HI>Wines;</HI> and if the Extravagance &s;hould now return to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Fancy, when the <HI>French</HI> Trade opens by this New Treaty, we may ruin our own Trade in &s;pight of the be&s;t Conditions and Articles in the World. As an Exhortation again&s;t this Humour in the People would be of greater U&s;e in the main, than all po&s;&s;ible Exclamation can be again&s;t the Treaty, &s;o it cannot be offen&s;ive to any one
<PB N="35" REF="34">
to &s;ay, that this will nece&s;&s;arily move the Go|vernment, when they &s;hall treat by the New Commi&s;&s;ioners, which the Treaty allows, that &s;uch Dutys may be kept up upon Foreign <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> or added if need be, as will give our <HI>En|gli&s;h Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Silk</HI> a &s;ufficient preference, and cau&s;e tho&s;e People, who will &s;till be for <HI>French</HI> Goods, to &s;ee the Madne&s;s and Di&s;tracti|on of their Fancy, and how dear they mu&s;t pay or wor&s;e Goods than they may have at home.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, but &s;uch Mea&s;ures would in Time give a &s;hock to the Mi&s;chief, and perhaps in Time take off our People from the Extrava|vagance and Folly, which has formerly done them &s;o much Harm in Trade, and is &s;till &s;o dangerous in the Ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are an Indu&s;trious People; they work cheap, and work well; their Fancy in contriving Fa&s;hions, Figures and Fancies in their Work, is very bright and quick, and the&s;e Things recommend their Goods to us; the Vanity and Levity of their Nation prompts them to apply to all the Novelties and Niceties of Dre&s;s; they gratify the Beaus and the Ladies, and this leads us in&s;en&s;ibly into the Error, and makes our Peo|ple infinitely fond of their Trade. If then the Commi&s;&s;aries, who are to meet and regulate the Trade, do not &s;tate the Duties on <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o as to give a very great Difference to the <HI>Engli&s;h Wrought Silk,</HI> &s;o as that they may not be di&s;couraged in their Work, and the Humour for every thing that is <HI>French</HI> again prevail, our Home-Trade will be ruin'd of Cour&s;e, and by its own Friends, even the very People who ought to &s;upport and carry it on.</P>

<P>The&s;e Dutys the <HI>French</HI> may &s;till be obliged to pay, becau&s;e all other Nations pay the &s;ame: Nay, if our Articles are rightly managed, and the Parliament thinks fit to lay any other and higher Dutys on the &s;aid Species of <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> &s;o be it, that other Nations pay the &s;ame Dutys upon Goods of the like Nature.</P>
<P>It is humbly recommended then to tho&s;e, in who&s;e Hands Power is or &s;hall be lodg'd to do the&s;e Things, that they would con&s;ider the many Thou&s;and Families of our Poor, as well <HI>Weavers</HI> as others, who depend upon the <HI>Silk Manufac|tures</HI> in this Nation; as al&s;o the Great and truly Beneficial Trade to <HI>Turkey</HI> and the <HI>Levant,</HI> from whence our <HI>Silk</HI> is chiefly Imported, and to pur|cha&s;e which, our <HI>Broad Cloth</HI> is &s;ent in &s;uch great Quantities, as to make a very con&s;iderable Figure al&s;o in the Employment of our People in the Country; all which mu&s;t &s;ink in a very great Degree, if &s;ome immediate Care is not taken, and Means u&s;ed to keep up the Value of our own <HI>Broad Silks,</HI> and keep down and di&s;courage, as much as may be, the Importation of <HI>French Silks,</HI> upon this New Opening of the Trade.</P>
<P>This is the rather urged now, becau&s;e it is evident that there is room very happily made in
<PB N="37" REF="36">
the Treaty for it, and that at the &s;ame time that we apprehend the Danger, we yet can with Satisfaction &s;o far Compliment the Makers of this Treaty, in that they have left room for &s;o advantageous a Step to be taken in favour of the <HI>Weavers,</HI> and <HI>Workers</HI> of <HI>Silk;</HI> and that by the Treaty it may be done, &s;ince, as above, the <HI>French</HI> &s;cruple not our high Duties at all, only de&s;ire that they may pay no more than other Nations, which if it be Granted them can do us no Harm, provided that both they and all other Nations may but be obliged to pay &s;o much, that we may be able to go on with our Trade at Home.</P>
<P>This is not &s;aid by way of Complaint again&s;t any thing agreed on in the Treaty: The Danger does not &s;eem to be in what is done, and Agreed on by the Treaty, but from what may yet be done in Con&s;equence of the Treaty; and there|fore it is, that this Ca&s;e is in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>We have &s;een very large Accounts Publi&s;hed of the Importations of <HI>Foreign Silks</HI> from <HI>France:</HI> Dr. <HI>Davenant</HI> in his Report to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Accounts &s;ays, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time gave his Maje&s;ty an Account, that the Importations from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>England</HI> only, amounted in Value in this one Article of <HI>Wrought Silks</HI> to <HI>l.</HI>300,000 <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>By a Scheme of the Trade to <HI>France</HI> now Printed and handed about, the &s;ame is Calculated for the Year 1674,<TABLE>

It is noted in the &s;ame Scheme, that there was recieved at the Port of <HI>Dover</HI> that Year <HI>l.</HI>15000 for the Dutys on <HI>French Wrought Silks,</HI> be&s;ides what may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be run there that Year.</P>
<P>It is not material for us to examine into the Truth of the&s;e Accounts: Nay, tho' they &s;hould be allowed to be Fictitious and Fal&s;e, as I believe they are.&mdash;But it will be allowed that the Quan|tity was very great; and it is Humbly Offered to the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e whom it concerns to weigh from hence, How great a Con&s;umption of the <HI>Silk Manufacture</HI> this Nation makes, and con&s;equently how well worthy their Concern it is, that as much of this as is po&s;&s;ible, might be manufactur'd by our own Hands, and the Trade be kept among our &s;elves.</P>
<P>It is true, as the Dutys are now, <HI>(viz.)</HI> 12<HI>l.</HI> for every 20<HI>l.</HI> or 12<HI>s. per</HI> Pound Duty on the &s;aid <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> it is a very great Difference; but as this comes to be reckoned upon the Mea|&s;ure, it does not, e&s;pecially in midling &s;light <HI>Silks,</HI> amount to much by the Yard; and &s;uppo&s;e it was one Shilling, or Two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard, it is too well known that the Humour of our La|dies, when they are buying Fine Cloths, and are wheedled with the Opinion of the Finene&s;s and Goodne&s;s of <HI>French Silks,</HI> is not to be re&s;train'd by a Shilling, Two or Three in a Yard.</P>
<P>If then the Duties were enlarged upon the &s;ine Wrought <HI>Silks</HI> to &s;uch a Degree, that the Weav|ing of <HI>Broad Silks</HI> and Rich <HI>Brocaded Silks</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> may not be di&s;couraged, &s;uch a Treaty of Commerce will be a happy means to prevent
<PB N="39" REF="38">
the Ruin of our Trade, the &s;tarving many Thou|&s;ands of Poor Familys, and the <HI>French</HI> Trade may not be &s;o prejudicial to us in that particular Trade, as otherwi&s;e there is rea&s;on to fear. It might be offered at to &s;et down what Addition of Duty would be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve our Trade in this Ca&s;e; but I rather choo&s;e to omit that, than pre&s;cribe to our Legi&s;lature: The <HI>Weavers</HI> are of Age; ask them, they are the be&s;t Judges.</P>
<P>The like Argument, and with the &s;ame Force, will hold good in the <HI>Linnen Manufacture,</HI> e&s;pe|cially &s;ince two great Events, both which have happened &s;ince the Commencement of the late War.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Prohibiting the Exportation of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> and the encouraging the making of <HI>Linnen</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Both the&s;e Countrys are now employed, at lea&s;t very con&s;iderably, in <HI>Linnen Manufactures,</HI> and it is not to be doubted, but that we are and ought to be very ju&s;tly concern'd for the Encou|ragement of them both. Now if the afore&s;aid Printed Accounts of Importations from <HI>France</HI> are true for the Year 1674, which however I mu&s;t own I do not Credit, yet thus far they &s;erve to argue in this Ca&s;e, that the <HI>Linnen Manufacture</HI> of <HI>France</HI> is very con&s;iderable.</P>
