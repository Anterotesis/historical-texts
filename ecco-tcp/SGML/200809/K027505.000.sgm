<P>THESE Ver&s;es had been Printed &s;oon after they were written, if they had not been de&s;ign'd rather privately to Condole, than publickly to Lament; for it is not pretended that they are in any kind equal to the Subject. But, by &s;ome Accident, many Copies of 'em have been di&s;per&s;ed, and one, I was informed, had been &s;hewn to a Book&s;eller. So that it was high time for me to prevent their appearing with more Faults than their own, which might probably have met with Encrea&s;e, if not from the Malice or Ignorance, at lea&s;t from the Carele&s;sne&s;s of an under-hand Publi&s;her.</P>
<P>I have particularly Rea&s;on at this time to apprehend the di&s;ingenuous Proceeding of &s;ome &s;uch Per&s;on, hav|ing lately &s;een &s;ome Ver&s;es Printed, and Intitled <HI>A Sa|tyr again&s;t Love, Revi&s;ed and Corrected by Mr.</HI> Congreve; who does a&s;&s;ure the Reader he never &s;aw or heard of any &s;uch Ver&s;es before they were &s;o Print|ed, <HI>viz.</HI> without either the Name of the Author, Book|&s;eller or Printer, being Publi&s;h'd after the manner of a Libel.</P>

<HEAD>THE TEARS OF <HI>AMARYLLIS</HI> FOR <HI>AMYNTAS.</HI> A PASTORAL.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS at the Time, when new returning Light,</L>
<L>With welcome Rays begins to chear the Sight;</L>
<L>When grateful Birds prepare their Thanks to pay,</L>
<L>And warble Hymns to hail the dawning Day;</L>
<L>When woolly Flocks their bleating Cries renew,</L>
<L>And from their fleecy Sides fir&s;t &s;hake the &s;ilver Dew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<L>'Twas then that <HI>Amaryllis,</HI> Heav'nly Fair,</L>
<L>Wounded with Grief, and wild with her De&s;pair,</L>
<L>For&s;ook her Myrtle Bow'r and Ro&s;ie Bed,</L>
<L>To tell the Winds her Woes, and mourn <HI>Amyntas</HI> dead.</L>
<L>Who had a Heart &s;o hard, that heard her Cries</L>
<L>And did not weep? Who &s;uch relentle&s;s Eyes?</L>
<L>Tygers and Wolves their wonted Rage forego,</L>
<L>And dumb Di&s;tre&s;s and new Compa&s;&s;ion &s;hew,</L>
<L>As taught by her to ta&s;te of Human Woe.</L>
<L>Nature her &s;elf attentive Silence kept,</L>
<L>And Motion &s;eem'd &s;u&s;pended while &s;he wept;</L>
<L>The ri&s;ing Sun re&s;train'd his fiery Cour&s;e,</L>
<L>And rapid Rivers li&s;ten'd at their Source;</L>
<L>Ev'n Eccho fear'd to catch the flying Sound,</L>
<L>Le&s;t Repetition &s;hould her Accents drown;</L>
<L>The very Morning Wind with-held his Breeze,</L>
<L>Nor fann'd with fragrant Wings the noi&s;ele&s;s Trees;</L>
<L>As if the gentle <HI>Zephyr</HI> had been dead,</L>
<L>And in the Grave with lov'd <HI>Amyntas</HI> laid.</L>
<L>No Voice, no whi&s;p'ring Sigh, no murm'ring Groan,</L>
<L>Pre&s;um'd to mingle with a Mother's Moan;</L>
<L>Her Cries alone her Angui&s;h could expre&s;s,</L>
<L>All other Mourning would have made it le&s;s.</L>

<L>Hear me, &s;he cry'd, ye Nymphs and Silvan Gods,</L>
<L>Inhabitants of the&s;e once lov'd Abodes;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5">
Hear my Di&s;tre&s;s, and lend a pitying Ear,</L>
<L>Hear my Complaint&mdash;you would not hear my Pray'r;</L>

<L>Tell me, thou Sun that round the World do&s;t &s;hine,</L>
<L>Ha&s;t thou beheld another Lo&s;s like mine?</L>
<L>Ye Winds, who on your Wings &s;ad Accents bear,</L>
<L>And catch the Sounds of Sorrow and De&s;pair,</L>
<L>Tell me if e'er your tender Pinions bore</L>
<L>Such weight of Woe, &s;uch deadly Sighs before?</L>
<L>Tell me, thou Earth, on who&s;e wide-&s;preading Ba&s;e</L>
<L>The wretched Load is laid of Human Race,</L>
<L>Do&s;t thou not feel thy &s;elf with me oppre&s;t?</L>

<L>When hoary Winter on thy &s;hrinking Head</L>

<L>Ha&s;t thou not felt le&s;s Chilne&s;s in thy Veins?</L>
<L>Do I not pierce thee with more freezing Pains;</L>
<L>But why to thee do I relate my Woe,</L>
<L>Thou cruel Earth, my mo&s;t remor&s;ele&s;s Foe?</L>
<L>Within who&s;e dark&s;ome Womb the Grave is made,</L>
<L>Where all my Joys are with <HI>Amyntas</HI> laid.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6">
What is't to me, tho' on thy naked Head</L>
<L>Eternal Winter &s;hould his Horror &s;hed?</L>

<L>And all thy Hopes of future Spring were lo&s;t;</L>
<L>To me what Comfort can the Spring afford?</L>
<L>Can my <HI>Amyntas</HI> be with Spring re&s;tor'd?</L>
<L>Can all the Rains that fall from weeping Skies,</L>
<L>Unlock the Tomb where my <HI>Amyntas</HI> lies?</L>
<L>No, never! never!&mdash;Say then, rigid Earth,</L>
<L>What is to me thy everla&s;ting Dearth?</L>

<L>None, none were found when I bewail'd their Want;</L>
<L>Nor whole&s;ome Herb was found, nor healing Plant,</L>
<L>To ea&s;e <HI>Amyntas</HI> of his cruel Pains;</L>
<L>In vain I &s;earch'd the Valleys, Hills and Plains;</L>
<L>But wither'd Leaves alone appear'd to view,</L>
<L>Or pois'nous Weeds di&s;tilling deadly Dew.</L>
<L>And if &s;ome naked Stalk, not quite decay'd,</L>
<L>To yield a fre&s;h and friendly Bud e&s;&s;ay'd,</L>
<L>Soon as I reach'd to crop the tender Shoot,</L>
<L>A &s;hrieking Mandrake kill'd it at the Root.</L>
<L>Witne&s;s to this, ye Fawns of ev'ry Wood,</L>
<L>Who at the Prodigy a&s;toni&s;h'd &s;tood.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7">
Well I remember what &s;ad Signs ye made,</L>
<L>What Show'rs of unavailing Tears ye &s;hed;</L>
<L>How each ran fearful to his mo&s;&s;ie Cave,</L>
<L>When the la&s;t Ga&s;p the dear <HI>Amyntas</HI> gave.</L>
<L>For then the Air was fill'd with dreadful Cries,</L>
<L>And &s;udden Night o'er&s;pread the darken'd Skies;</L>
<L>Phantoms, and Fiends, and wand'ring Fires appear'd,</L>
<L>And Skreams of ill-pre&s;aging Birds were heard.</L>
<L>The Fore&s;t &s;hook, and flinty Rocks were cleft,</L>
<L>And frighted Streams their wonted Channels left;</L>
<L>With frantick Grief o'erflowing fruitful Ground,</L>
<L>Where many a Herd and harmele&s;s Swain was drown'd.</L>
<L>While I forlorn and de&s;olate was left,</L>
<L>Of ev'ry Help, of ev'ry Hope bereft;</L>
<L>To ev'ry Element expos'd I lay,</L>
<L>And to my Griefs a more defencele&s;s Prey.</L>
<L>For thee, <HI>Amyntas,</HI> all the&s;e Pains were born,</L>
<L>For thee the&s;e Hands were wrung, the&s;e Hairs were torn;</L>
<L>For thee my Soul to &s;igh &s;hall never leave,</L>
<L>The&s;e Eyes to weep, this throbbing Heart to heave.</L>
<L>To mourn thy Fall I'll fly the hated Light,</L>
<L>And hide my Head in Shades of endle&s;s Night:</L>
<L>For thou were Light, and Life, and Health to me;</L>
<L>The Sun but thankle&s;s &s;hines that &s;hews not thee.</L>
<L>Wert thou not Lovely, Graceful, Good and Young?</L>
<L>The Joy of Sight, the Talk of ev'ry Tongue?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8">
Did ever Branch &s;o &s;weet a Blo&s;&s;om bear?</L>
<L>Or ever early Fruit appear &s;o fair?</L>
<L>Did ever Youth &s;o far his Years tran&s;cend?</L>
<L>Did ever Life &s;o immaturely end!</L>
<L>For thee the tuneful Swains provided Lays,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Mu&s;e prepar'd thy future Prai&s;e.</L>
<L>For thee the bu&s;ie Nymphs &s;tripp'd ev'ry Grove,</L>
<L>And Myrtle Wreaths and Flow'ry Chaplets wove.</L>
<L>But now, ah di&s;mal Change! the tuneful Throng</L>
<L>To loud Lamentings turn the chearful Song.</L>
<L>Their plea&s;ing Task the weeping Virgins leave,</L>
<L>And with unfini&s;h'd Garlands &s;trew thy Grave.</L>
<L>There let me fall, there, there lamenting lie,</L>
<L>There grieving grow to Earth, de&s;pair, and die.</L>

<L>This &s;aid, her loud Complaint of force &s;he ceas'd,</L>
<L>Exce&s;s of Grief her faultring Speech &s;uppre&s;s'd.</L>
<L>Along the Ground her colder Limbs &s;he laid,</L>
<L>Where late the Grave was for <HI>Amyntas</HI> made;</L>
<L>Then from her &s;wimming Eyes began to pour,</L>
<L>Of &s;oftly falling Rain a Silver Show'r;</L>
<L>Her loo&s;ely flowing Hair, all radiant bright,</L>
<L>O'er-&s;pread the dewy Gra&s;s like Streams of Light.</L>
<L>As if the Sun had of his Beams been &s;horn,</L>
<L>And ca&s;t to Earth the Glories he had worn.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9">
A Sight &s;o lovely &s;ad, &s;uch deep Di&s;tre&s;s</L>

<L>And now the Winds, which had &s;o long been &s;till,</L>
<L>Began the &s;welling Air with Sighs to fill;</L>
<L>The Water-Nymphs, who motionle&s;s remain'd,</L>
<L>Like Images of Ice, while &s;he complain'd,</L>
<L>Now loos'd their Streams; as when de&s;cending Rains</L>
<L>Roll the &s;teep Torrents headlong o'er the Plains.</L>
<L>The prone Creation, who &s;o long had gaz'd,</L>
<L>Charm'd with her Cries, and at her Griefs amaz'd,</L>
<L>Began to roar and howl with horrid Yell,</L>
<L>Di&s;mal to hear, and terrible to tell;</L>
<L>Nothing but Groans and Sighs were heard around,</L>
<L>And Eccho multiply'd each mournful Sound.</L>

<L>When all at once an univer&s;al Pau&s;e</L>
<L>Of Grief was made, as from &s;ome &s;ecret Cau&s;e.</L>
<L>The Balmy Air with fragrant Scents was fill'd,</L>
<L>As if each weeping Tree had Gums di&s;till'd.</L>
<L>Such, if not &s;weeter, was the rich Perfume</L>
<L>Which &s;wift a&s;cended from <HI>Amyntas</HI>'s Tomb;</L>
<L>As if th' <HI>Arabian</HI> Bird her Ne&s;t had fir'd,</L>

<LG>
<L>And now the Turf, which late was naked &s;een,</L>

<L>From ev'ry Tear that fell, a Violet grew,</L>

<L>Remember this, ye Nymphs and gentle Maids,</L>
<L>When Solitude ye &s;eek in gloomy Shades;</L>
<L>Or walk on Banks where &s;ilent Waters flow,</L>
<L>For there this lonely Flow'r will love to grow.</L>

<L>To crop the Stalks and take 'em &s;oftly up.</L>
<L>When in your &s;nowy Necks their Sweets you wear,</L>
<L>Give a &s;oft Sigh, and drop a tender Tear:</L>
