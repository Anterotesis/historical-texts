<P>THE SCHOOL for ARROGANCE: A <HI>COMEDY.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Comedy of <HI>Le Glorieux,</HI> by M. Nericault De&s;touches, is the ba&s;is on which <HI>The School for Arrogance</HI> has been formed. From that I have taken the plan, &s;everal of the characters, and &s;ome of the &s;cenes. Difference of arrangement, addi|tional incidents, and what I deem to be e&s;|&s;ential changes of character, have all been introduced. The Count has but little re|&s;emblance to the original: Lucy and Mac Dermot none. Lady Peckham is a new character, and was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted by a friend; who, conceiving highly of the contra&s;t which exi&s;ts in life, between the pride of rank and the pride of riches, indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought to &s;timulate and rou&s;e my imagination.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the piece is greatly inte|re&s;ting to morals, and highly worthy of the Theatre. Con&s;cious of the great effects a perfect Comedy might have produced, I re|gret the imperfections of the pre&s;ent. Some good it will do: I regret that it cannot do more. Per&s;uaded as I am of the moral
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
dignity of the &s;tage, I cheri&s;h an enthu&s;ia&s;tic wi&s;h to &s;ee the dramatic art &s;urpa&s;s even all its former &s;ublime efforts. Among the plea&s;ures of the imagination, how frequently has its place been the fir&s;t! Happy indeed &s;hould I be, could my &s;ucce&s;s add the &s;malle&s;t impul&s;e to the exertions of Genius: ineffa|bly happy, would but this noble art once more boldly a&s;&s;ert its rank; and render it|&s;elf, not only the general love and delight of mankind, but the veneration of the wi&s;e.</P>
<P>It is with peculiar plea&s;ure that I here ac|knowledge how much I am indebted to the conduct of Mr. Mar&s;hal; who, in con&s;e|quence of the prejudices which it was ima|gined Mr. Harris laboured under, re&s;pecting me, acted, for a time, in my behalf, as the author of the piece. Though anxiou&s;ly zealous for its &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;till continued impartially attentive to the intere&s;ts of all parties; and &s;acrificed his own feelings to promote what he conceived to be a public good.</P>
<P>The tribute of ju&s;tice is al&s;o due to Mr. Harris. This tribute I am happy to have an opportunity to pay. And, that I may
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
now be con&s;i&s;tent, as I always have been, in my private and public language to Mr. Harris, I will here in&s;ert a copy of a letter which I wrote to him, when the comedy had been twice performed.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE patiently waited the proper moment in which to write to you. That moment I hope is now come. I &s;hould be guilty of inju&s;tice, were I any longer to delay expre&s;&s;ing my &s;en&s;e of the pro|priety with which you have acted, rela|tively to The School for Arrogance, after you had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it mine. Such conduct, Sir, is highly honourable; and is not only productive of the be&s;t ef|fects, but mu&s;t &s;ecure the be&s;t and mo&s;t permanent applau&s;e. That you had con|ceived di&s;advantageous ideas of me I knew; though I have no doubt but I &s;hall ulti|mately convince you that, even &s;uppo&s;ing me to be mi&s;taken, my motives have been laudable ***** <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A &s;ingle phra&s;e, which relates entirely to my&s;elf, is here omitted.</NOTE>. With me you were
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
irritated; but you had the ju&s;tice to forget the man, and promote the intere&s;ts of the piece. This I hold it my duty to &s;ay to the world at large.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I am, Sir, Your obliged humble &s;ervant,</SALUTE>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To THOMAS HARRIS, E&s;q.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mr. Harris kindly expre&s;&s;ed the &s;atisfac|tion which his own private feelings received, from this letter; nor can there be a doubt but that the propriety of his conduct, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, will be as agreeable to him&s;elf, and as plea&s;ing to the public, as it has been to me.</P>

<P>Oh! As for that, honey, let him alone. The noble&s;t blood of France, aye, and what is better, of Ireland too, trickles to his finger's ends. The Villars and the O'Connol|lies.</P>

<P>How?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is viry willing to marry the young Lady, but not her family. His pride and his pa&s;&s;ion have had many a tough battle about that, d'ye &s;ee. Only think! A direct de&s;cindant of the former kings of Ireland, and collateral cou&s;in to a pri&s;ent peer of France, to be&s;mear and be&s;moulder his dignity by rubbing it again&s;t porter butts, vinegar ca&s;ks, and beer barrels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mi&s;s Lucy is indeed a lovely girl, animated to exce&s;s, and &s;ometimes apparently giddy and flighty: but &s;he has an excellent under&s;tanding, and a noble heart; and the&s;e are &s;uperior to birth, which is indeed a thing of mere accident.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A de&s;picable di&s;pute for preceden|cy was the occa&s;ion of a duel, in which your father killed his antagoni&s;t, who&s;e enraged fa|mily, by &s;uborning witne&s;&s;es, cau&s;ed him to be convicted of murder, obliged him to fly the kingdom, and with your mother wander under a borrowed name, a fugitive in di&s;tant coun|tries.</P>

<P>He him&s;elf can &s;carcely &s;ay. His enemies have di&s;covered him, are hot in pur&s;uit, and fertile in &s;tratagems and &s;nares. They know that ju&s;tice is now bu&s;ied in his behalf; but ju&s;tice is &s;low, and revenge is re&s;tle&s;s.&mdash;Their activity, I hear, is redoubled.</P>

<P>The feelings of injured honour, Ma|dam, perhaps may be too irritable. They &s;hrink from in&s;ult, and &s;purn at contamination! Yet honour is the &s;ource of a thou&s;and virtues!

<P>Chequered are the &s;cenes of life. Plea&s;ure and pain, joy and grief, au&s;terity and laughter, intermingling, weave a motley web. Our prejudices are our puni&s;hments: they cling about us, warp our actions, di&s;tort our manners, render us the food of &s;atire, the mockery of fools, and torture us, as wailing ur|chins are tormented to make &s;port for boys. Error and folly impede the progre&s;s of perfec|tion.
