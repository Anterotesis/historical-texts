<HEAD>THE COTTAGE COOK.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. JONES was a great merchant's lady. She was liberal to the poor, but as &s;he was too much taken up with the world, &s;he did not &s;pare &s;o much of her time and thoughts about do|ing good as &s;he ought, &s;o that her money was often ill be&s;towed. In the late troubles, Mr. Jones, who had lived in a grand manner, failed, and he took his misfortunes &s;o much to heart that he fell &s;ick and died. Mrs. Jones retired on a very nar|row income to the &s;mall village of We&s;ton, where &s;he &s;eldom went out except to church. Though a pious woman &s;he was too apt to indulge her &s;or|row; and though &s;he did not neglect to read and pray, yet &s;he gave up a great part of her time to melancholy thoughts, and grew quite inactive. She well knew how &s;inful it would be for her to &s;eek a cure for her grief in worldly plea&s;ures, which is a way many people take under afflictions, but &s;he was not aware how wrong it was to weep away that time which might have been better &s;pent in drying the tears of others.</P>
<P>It was happy for her that Mr. Simp&s;on, the vicar of We&s;ton, was a pious man. One Sunday he happened to preach on the good Samaritan. It was a charity Sermon, and there was a collection at the door. He called on Mrs. Jones after church, and found her in tears. She told him &s;he had been
<PB N="3" REF="3">much moved By his di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;he wept be|cau&s;e &s;he had &s;o little to give to the plate; for though &s;he felt very keenly for the poor in the&s;e dear times, yet &s;he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t them. "In|deed Sir," added &s;he, "I never &s;o much regretted the lo&s;s of my fortune, as this afternoon, when you bade us <HI>go and do likewi&s;e."</HI> "You do not," replied Mr. Simp&s;on "enter into the &s;pirit of our Saviour's parable, if you think you cannot <HI>go and do likewi&s;e</HI> without being rich. In the ca&s;e of the Samaritan you may ob&s;erve, that charity was afforded more by kindne&s;s, and care, and me|dicine, than by money. You, Madam, were as much concerned in my Sermon as Sir John with his great e&s;tate; and, to &s;peak plainly, I have been &s;ometimes &s;urprized that you &s;hould not put your-in the way of being more u&s;eful."</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid Mrs. Jones "I am grown &s;hy of the poor &s;ince I have nothing to give them." "No|thing Madam," replied the Clergyman, "do you call your time, your talents, your kind offices, nothing? I will venture to &s;ay that you might do more good than the riche&s;t man in the pari&s;h could do by merely giving his money. In&s;tead of &s;itting here brooding over your misfortunes, which are pa&s;t remedy, be&s;tir your&s;elf to find out ways of doing much good with little money; or even with|out any money at all. You have lately &s;tudied oeconomy for vour&s;elf. In&s;truct your poor neigh|bours in it. They want it almo&s;t as much as they want money. You have influence with the few rich per&s;ons in the pari&s;h. Exert that influence. Betty, my hou&s;ekeeper, &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t you in any thing in which &s;he can be u&s;eful. Try this for one year
<PB N="4" REF="4">and if you then tell me that you &s;hould have bet|ter &s;hewn your love to God and man, and been a happier woman had you continued gloomy and in|active, I &s;hall be much &s;urprized."</P>
<P>The Sermon and this di&s;cour&s;e made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on Mrs. Jones, that &s;he formed a new plan of life, and &s;et about it at once, as every body does who is in earne&s;t. Her chief aim was the happine&s;s of her poor neighbours in the next world; but &s;he was al&s;o very de&s;irous to promote their pre&s;ent comfort. The plans &s;he pur&s;ued with a view to the latter object &s;hall be explained in this little book. Mrs. Jones was much re&s;pected by all the rich per&s;ons in We&s;ton who had known her in her pro&s;perity. Sir John was thoughtle&s;s, lavi&s;h and indolent. The Squire was over-frugal, but active, &s;ober, and not ill-natured. Sir John loved plea&s;ure, the Squire loved money. Sir John was one of tho&s;e popular &s;ort of people who get much prai&s;e and yet do little good; who &s;ub&s;cribe with equal readine&s;s to a cricket match or a cha|rity &s;chool; who take it for granted that the poor are to be indulged with bell ringing and bonfires, and to be made drunk at Chri&s;tmas, this Sir John called being kind to them; but he thought it was folly to teach them, and madne&s;s to think of re&s;orming them. He was, however, always ready to give his guinea; but I que&s;tion whether he would have given up his hunting and his gaming to have cured every grievance in the land. On the other hand, the Squire would a&s;&s;i&s;t Mrs. Jones in any of her plans if it co&s;t him nothing; &s;o &s;he &s;hewed her good &s;en&s;e by never a&s;king Sir John for advice, or the Squire for &s;ub&s;criptions, and by this prudence gained the full &s;upport of both.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
Mrs. Jones re&s;olved to &s;pend two or three days in a week in getting acquainted with the &s;tate of the pari&s;h, and &s;he took care never to walk out without a few little good books in her pocket to give away. She found that among the numerous wants &s;he met with, no &s;mall &s;hare was owing to bad management or to impo&s;ition. She was &s;truck with the &s;mall &s;ize of the loaves. Wheat was now not very dear, and &s;he was &s;ure a good deal of blame re&s;ted with the baker. She &s;ent for a &s;hilling loaf to the next great town where the mayor often &s;ent to the bakers &s;hops to &s;ee that the bread was pro|per weight. She weighed her own loaf again&s;t her country loaf, and found the latter two pounds lighter than it ought to be. This was not the &s;ort of grievance to carry to Sir John; but luckily the Squire was al&s;o a magi&s;trate, and it was quite in his way. He told her he could remedy the evil if &s;ome one would lodge an information again&s;t the baker.</P>
<P>She dropt in on the black&s;mith. He was at dinner. She enquired if his bread was good. "Aye good enough mi&s;tre&s;s, for you &s;ee 'tis as white as your cap, if we had but more of it. Here's a &s;ixpenny loaf, you might take it for a penny roll!" He then heartily cur&s;ed Crib the baker, and &s;aid, he ought to be hanged. Mrs. Jones now told him what &s;he had done, how &s;he had detected the fraud, and a&s;&s;ured him the evil &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed on the morrow, provided he would appear and inform. "I in|form!" &s;aid he with a &s;hocking oath, "hang an informer! I &s;corn the office." "You are nice in the wrong place, friend," replied Mrs. Jones,
<PB N="6" REF="6">"for you do not &s;corn to abu&s;e the baker, nor to be in a pa&s;&s;ion, nor to &s;wear, though you &s;corn to redre&s;s a public injury, and to increa&s;e your children's bread. Let me tell you, there is no|thing in which you ignorant people mi&s;take more than in your notions about <HI>informers.</HI> Informing is a lawful way of obtaining redre&s;s, and though it is a mi&s;chievous and hateful thing to go to a ju&s;|tice about every trifling matter, yet laying an in|formation on important occa&s;ions, without malice or bitterne&s;s of any kind, is what no hone&s;t man ought to be a&s;hamed of. The &s;hame is to commit the offence, not to inform again&s;t it. I, for my part, &s;hould perhaps do right if I not only inform|ed again&s;t Crib for making light bread, but again&s;t you for &s;wearing at him." "Well, but Madam," &s;aid the &s;mith, a little &s;oftened, "don't you think it a &s;in and a &s;hame to turn informer?" "So far from it when a man's motives are good," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "that in &s;uch clear ca&s;es as the pre&s;ent I think it a duty and a virtue." If it is right that there &s;hould be laws it mu&s;t be right that they &s;hould be put in execution; but how can this be, if people will not inform the magi&s;trates when they &s;ee the laws broken? An informer by trade is commonly a knave; a ra&s;h, malicious, or pa&s;&s;io|nate informer is a fire brand, but hone&s;t and pru|dent informers are almo&s;t as u&s;eful members of &s;ociety as the judges of the land. If you continue in your pre&s;ent mind on this &s;ubject, do not you think that you will be an&s;werable for the crimes you might have prevented by informing, and be a &s;ort of accomplice of the villains who commit them?"</P>
<P>"Well Madam," &s;aid the &s;mith, "I now &s;ee plainly
<PB N="7" REF="7">enough that there is no &s;hame in turning informer when my cau&s;e is good." "And your motive right, always mind that," &s;aid Mrs. Jones. Next day the &s;mith attended, Crib was fined in the u&s;ual penalty, his light bread was taken from him and given to the poor. The ju&s;tices re&s;olved hence|forward to in&s;pect the bakers in their di&s;tricts; and all of them, except Crib and &s;uch as Crib, were glad of it, for hone&s;ty never dreads a trial. Thus had Mrs. Jones the comfort of &s;eeing how u&s;eful peo|ple may be without expence; for if &s;he could have given the poor 50<HI>l.</HI> &s;he would not have done them &s;o great or &s;o la&s;ting a benefit, and the true light in which &s;he had put the ba&s;ine&s;s of <HI>informing</HI> was of no &s;mall u&s;e.</P>
<P>There were two &s;hops ia the pari&s;h, but Mrs. Sparks at the Cro&s;s had not half &s;o much cu&s;tom as Wills at the Sugar Loaf, though &s;he &s;old her goods a penny in a &s;hilling cheaper, and all agreed that they were much better. Mrs. Jones a&s;ked Mrs. Sparks the rea&s;on. "Madam," &s;aid the &s;hopkeeper, "Mr. Wills will give longer tru&s;t. Be&s;ides this, his wife keeps &s;hop on a Sunday morning while I am at church." Mrs. Jones reminded Mr. Simp&s;on to read the King's Proclamation again&s;t vice and immorality next Sunday at church and prevailed on the Squire to fine any one who &s;hould keep open &s;hop on a Sunday. She al&s;o put the people in mind that a &s;hopkeeper, who would &s;ell on a Sunday, would be more likely to cheat them all the week, than one who went to Church.</P>
<P>She al&s;o laboured hard to convince them how much they would le&s;&s;en their di&s;tre&s;s if they would contrive to deal with Mrs. Sparks for ready money,
<PB N="8" REF="8">rather than Wills on long credit; tho&s;e who li&s;tened to her found their circum&s;tances far more comfortable at the year's end, while the re&s;t, tempt|ed, like &s;ome of their betters, by the plea&s;ure of putting off the evil day of payment, like them at la&s;t found them&s;elves plunged in debt and di&s;tre&s;s. She took care to make a good u&s;e of &s;uch in|&s;tances in her conver&s;ations with the poor, and, by per&s;everance, &s;he at length brought them &s;o much to her way of thinking, that Wills found it to be his intere&s;t to alter his plan, and &s;ell his goods on as good terms and as &s;hort credit as Mrs Sparks &s;old hers. This compleated Mrs. Jones's &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;he had the &s;atisfaction of having put a &s;top to three or four great evils in the pari&s;h of We&s;ton, without &s;pending a &s;hilling in doing it.</P>
<P>Patty &s;mart and Jenny Ro&s;e were thought to be the two be&s;t managers in the pari&s;h. They both told Mrs. Jones that the poor will get the coar&s;e pieces of meat cheaper, if the gentlefolks did not buy them for &s;oups and gravy. Mrs. Jones thought there was rea&s;on in this. So away &s;he went to Sir John the Squire, the Surgeon, the Attorney, and the Steward, the only per&s;ons in the pari&s;h who could afford to buy co&s;tly things. She told them that if they would all be &s;o good as to buy only prime pieces, which they could very well afford, the coar&s;e and cheap joints would come more within the reach of the poor. Mo&s;t of the gentry readily con|&s;ented. Sir John cared not for what his meat co&s;t him, but told Mrs. Jones in his gay way, that he would eat any thing, or give any thing, &s;o that &s;he would not teaze him with long &s;tories about the poor. The Squire &s;aid, he &s;hould prefer vege|able &s;oups, becau&s;e they were cheaper, and the
<PB N="9" REF="9">Doctor, becau&s;e they were whole&s;omer. The Steward cho&s;e to imitate the 'Squire; and the Attorney found it would be quite ungenteel to &s;tand out. So gravy &s;oups became very unfa&s;hionable in the pari&s;h of We&s;ton; and I am &s;ure if rich people did but think a little on this &s;ubject, they would be as unfa&s;hionable in many other places.</P>
<P>When wheat grew cheaper Mrs. Jones was earne&s;t with the poor women to bake large brown loaves at home, in&s;tead of buying &s;mall white ones at the &s;hop. Mrs. Betty had told her, that baking at home would be one &s;tep towards re&s;toring the good old management. Only Betty Smart and Jenny Ro&s;e baked at home in the whole pari&s;h, and who lived &s;o well as they did? Yet the general objec|tion &s;eemed rea&s;onable. They could not bake without yea&s;t, which often could not be had, as no one brewed but the great folks and the public hou&s;es. Mrs. Jones found; however, that Patty and Jenny contrived to brew as well as to bake. She &s;ent for the&s;e women, knowing that from them &s;he &s;hould get truth and rea&s;on. "How comes it," &s;aid &s;he to them, "that you two are the only poor women in the pari&s;h who can afford to brew a &s;mall ca&s;k of beer? Your hu&s;bands have not bet|ter wages than other men." "True Madam," &s;aid Patty, "but they never &s;et foot in a public hou&s;e. I will tell you the truth. When I fir&s;t mar|ried, our John went to the Checquers every night, and I had my tea and fre&s;h butter twice a-day at home. This &s;lop, which con&s;umed a deal of &s;ugar, began to <HI>rake</HI> my &s;tomach &s;adly, as I had neither meat nor milk; at la&s;t (I am a&s;hamed to own it) I began to take a drop of gin to quiet the pain, till in time I looked for my gin as regularly as
<PB N="10" REF="10">for my tea. At la&s;t the gin, the ale-hou&s;e, and the tea began to make us both &s;ick and poor. I had like to have died with my fir&s;t child. Par&s;on Simp&s;on then talked &s;o finely to us that we re|&s;olved, by the grace of God, to turn over a new leaf, and I promi&s;ed John if he would give up the Checquers, I would break the gin bottle, and never drink tea in the afternoon, except on Sundays when he was at home with me. We have kept our word, and both our eating and drinking, our health and our con&s;cience are the better for it. Though meat is &s;adly dear we can buy two pounds of fre&s;h meat for le&s;s than one pound of fre&s;h but|ter, and it gives five times the nouri&s;hment. And dear as malt is, I contrive to keep a drop of drink in the hou&s;e for John, and John will make me drink half a pint with him every evening, and a pint a day when I am a nur&s;e."</P>
<P>As one good deed as well as one bad one brings on another, this conver&s;ation &s;et Mrs. Jones on enquiring why &s;o many ale-hou&s;es were allowed. She did not chu&s;e to talk to Sir John on this &s;ubject, who would only have &s;aid "let them enjoy them|&s;elves poor fellows; if they get drunk now and then, they work hard." But tho&s;e who have this fal&s;e good-nature forget, that while the man is <HI>en|joying him&s;elf,</HI> as it is called, his wife and children are ragged and &s;tarving. True chri&s;tian good-na|ture never indulges one at the co&s;t of many, but is kind to all. The Squire, who was a friend to order, took up the matter. He con&s;ulted Mr. Simp&s;on. "The Lion," &s;aid he "is nece&s;&s;ary. It &s;tands by the road &s;ide: travellers mu&s;t have a re&s;t|ing place. As to the Chequers and the Bell they do no good but much harm." Mr. Simp&s;on had before
<PB N="11" REF="11">made many attempts to get the Checquers put down; but unluckily it was Sir John's own hou&s;e, and kept by his late butler. Not that Sir John valued the rent, but he had a fal&s;e kindne&s;s which made him &s;upport the cau&s;e of an old &s;ervant, though he knew he kept a di&s;orderly hou&s;e. The 'Squire, however, now took away the licence from the Lion. And a fray happening &s;oon after at the Checquers which was near the church) in time of divine &s;ervice, Sir John was obliged to &s;uffer the hou&s;e to be put down as a nui&s;ance. You would not believe how many poor families were able to brew a little ca&s;k when the temptations of tho&s;e ale hou&s;es were taken out of their way. Mrs. Jones in her evening walks had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee many an hone&s;t man drinking his whole&s;ome cup of beer by his own fire &s;ide, his ro&s;y children playing about his knees, his clean chearful wife &s;inging her younge&s;t baby to &s;leep, rocking the cradle with her foot, while with her hands &s;he was making a dumpling for her kind hu&s;band's &s;upper. Some few, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, though I don't chu&s;e to name names, &s;till preferred getting drunk once a week at the Lion, and drinking water at other times.</P>
<P>The good women being now &s;upplied with yea&s;t from each other's brewings, would have baked, but two difficulties &s;till remained. Many of them had no ovens, for &s;ince the new bad management had crept in&punc; many cottages have been built without this convenience. Fuel al&s;o was &s;carce at We&s;ton. Mrs. Jones advi&s;ed the building a large pari&s;h oven. To this oven, at a certain hour, three times a week, the elder children carried the loaves which their mothers had made at home, and paid a halfpenny,
<PB N="12" REF="12">or a penny, according to their &s;ize, for the bak|ing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones found that no poor women in We&s;ton could buy a little milk, as the farmers' wives did not care to rob their dairies. This was a great di&s;|tre&s;s, e&s;pecially when the children were &s;ick. So Mrs. Jones advi&s;ed Mrs. Sparks at the Cro&s;s to keep a couple of cows, and &s;ell out the milk by halfpen|nyworths. She did &s;o, and found, that though this plan gave her &s;ome additional trouble, &s;he got full as much by it as if &s;he had made chee&s;e and butter. She al&s;o &s;old rice at a cheap rate, &s;o that with the help of the milk and the publick oven, a fine rice pudding was to be had for a trifle,</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How Mrs. Jones managed her Sunday &s;chools, and al&s;o her method of religious in&s;truction on week days, may be &s;hewn hereafter.</NOTE> The girls' &s;chool in the pari&s;h was fallen into neglect, for though many would be &s;ub&s;cribers, yet no one would look after it. I wi&s;h this was the ca&s;e at We&s;ton only. It was not in Mr. Simp&s;on's way to &s;ee if girls were taught to work. This is ladies' bu&s;ine&s;s&punc; Mrs. Jones con&s;ulted her coun&s;ellor Mrs. Betty, and they went every Friday to the &s;chool where they invited mothers as well as daughters to come, and learn to cut out to the be&s;t advan|tage. Mrs. Jones had not been bred to the&s;e things, but by means of Mrs. Cooper's excellent cutting out book, &s;he &s;oon became mi&s;tre&s;s of the whole art. She not only had the girls taught to make and mend but to wa&s;h and iron too. She al&s;o allowed the mother, or elde&s;t daughter of every family, to come once a week, and learn how to dre&s;s <HI>one cheap di&s;h.</HI> One Friday, which was cooking day, who
<PB N="13" REF="13">&s;hould pa&s;s by but the 'Squire, with his gun and his dogs. He looked into the &s;chool for the fir&s;t time. "Well, madam," &s;aid he, "what good are you doing here? What are your girls learning and earning? Where are your manufactures? Where is your &s;pinning and your carding?" "Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "this is a &s;mall pari&s;h, and you know ours is not a manufacturing country; &s;o that when the&s;e girls are women, they will not be much em|ployed in &s;pinning. However, we teach them a little of it, and more of knitting, that they may be able to get up a &s;mall piece of hou&s;ehold linen once a year, and provide the family with &s;tockings, by employing the odds and ends of their time in the&s;e ways. But there is a manufacture which I am carrying on, and I know of none within my own reach which is &s;o valuable." "What can that be?" &s;aid the 'Squire. "To MAKE GOOD WIVES FOR WORKING MEN." &s;aid &s;he. "Is not mine an excellent &s;taple commodity? I am teaching the&s;e girls the art of indu&s;try and good management. It is little encouragement to an hone&s;t man to work hard all the week, if his wages are wa&s;ted by a &s;lattern at home." "What have you got on the fire, madam?" &s;aid the 'Squire, "for your pot really &s;mells as &s;avoury, as if Sir John's French Cook had filled it." "Sir," replied Mrs. Jones, "I have lately got acquainted with Mrs. White, who has given us an account of her cheap di&s;hes, and wi&s;e cookery, in one of the Cheap Repo&s;itory little books. Mrs. Betty and I have made all her di&s;hes, and very good they are, and we have got &s;everal others of our own. Every Friday we come here and dre&s;s one. The&s;e good women &s;ee how it is done, and learn to dre&s;s it at their own hou&s;es.
<PB N="14" REF="14">I take home part for my own dinner, and what is left I give to each in turn. I hope I have pened their eyes on a &s;ad mi&s;take they had got into, <HI>that we think any thing is good enough for the poor."</HI></P>
<P>"Pray Mrs. Betty," &s;aid the Squire, "oblige me with a ba&s;on of your &s;oup." The Squire found it &s;o good after his walk, that he was almo&s;t &s;orry he had promi&s;ed to buy no more legs of beef, and de|clared again that not one &s;heep's head &s;hould ever go to his kennel again. He begged his cook might have the receipt, and Mrs. Jones wrote it out for her. She has al&s;o been &s;o obliging as to favour me with a copy of all her receipts. And as I hate all monopoly; and &s;ee no rea&s;on why &s;uch cheap, nouri&s;hing, and &s;avoury di&s;hes &s;hould be confined to the pari&s;h of We&s;ton, I print them, that all other pari&s;hes may have the &s;ame advantage. Not only the poor, but all per&s;ons with &s;mall incomes may be glad of them. "Well, madam," &s;aid Mr. Simp|&s;on, who came in &s;oon after, "which is be&s;t, to &s;it down and cry over our misfortunes, or to be&s;tir our&s;elves to do our duty to the world?" "Sir," replied Mrs. Jones, "I thank you for the u&s;eful le&s;&s;on you have given me. You have taught me that our time and talents are to be employed with zeal in God's &s;ervice, if we wi&s;h for his favour here or hereafter, and that one great employment of them, which he requires, is the promotion of the pre&s;ent, and much more, the future happine&s;s of all around us. You have taught me that much good may be done with little money, and that the heart, the head, and the hands are of &s;ome u&s;e, as well as the pur&s;e."</P>

<HEAD>FRIENDLY HINTS.</HEAD>
<P>The difference between eating bread new and &s;tale, is one loaf in five.</P>
<P>If you turn your meat into broth it will go much farther than if you roa&s;t or bake it.</P>
<P>If you have a garden, make the mo&s;t of it. A bit of leek or an onion makes all di&s;hes &s;avoury at &s;mall expence.</P>
<P>If the money &s;pent on fre&s;h butter were &s;pent or meat, poor families would be much better fed than they are.</P>
<P>If the money &s;pent on tea were &s;pent on home-brewed beer, the wife would be better fed, the hu&s;band better plea&s;ed, and both would be heal|thier.</P>
<P>Keep a little Scotch barley, rice, dry pea&s;e, and oatmeal in the hou&s;e. They are all cheap and don't &s;poil. Keep al&s;o pepper and ginger.</P>
<P>Pay your debts, &s;erve God, love your neigh|bour.</P>
